"He finished #3 in MVP voting just two seasons ago. He‚Äôs not in the top ~5 royalty of the league, but IMO he *is* a superstar - problem is nobody‚Äôs star shines quite as brightly when playing alongside a top 5 megastar so it‚Äôs easy to forget.  If PG was the sole scorer on the Jazz and Donovan Mitchell was the #2 option on the Clips behind Kawhi, PG would be looked at in a far brighter light while Donovan would be getting underrated as a‚Äùfuture star‚Äù right now."
Man really said playoff Donovan Mitchell is basically the same as 2x FMVP 2x NBA champion kawhi leonard
"Could that have been his inability to get to where he normally can get, so he had to bail out on the fly without being prepared to do so?  Nahhh. Donovan Mitchell stupid. That's it."
"Nah man, it was Donovan Mitchell and Donovan Mitchell alone that missed those 13 straight 3s."
Donovan Mitchell needs to learn how to play with control. Not sure why the Jazz let‚Äôs him run down the court and chuck 3‚Äôs
Donovan Mitchell. You‚Äôre not Steph Curry.
Mitchell and Conley are our best in the midrange and Donovan was clearly not 100%.
"Yeah, Jazz couldn‚Äôt buy a basket tonight and donovan Mitchell just kept chucking up 3s"
"Donovan Mitchell choked away the rookie of the year to a non-rookie, so easily him."
Donovan ‚ÄúKobe Bryant‚Äù Mitchell.
You mean Donovan Mitchell throwing up 3 airballs at the end?
Donovan mitchell has some horrible shot selection
The Utah Jazz are 0-3 since Stephen A. Smith crowned Donovan Mitchell as the greatest Jazz player ever.
?? He's hurt and Conley is out. Mitchell has been fantastic given the circumstances. I feel like Clarkson and Gobert got exposed more than Donovan Mitchell
Donovan Mitchell missed 14 of them.

"Donovan ""Airball"" Mitchell"
I was taking a nice nap on the couch during the Jazz vs. Clippers game when an explosion startled me awake. It turns out the sound was just another Donovan Mitchell three point brick clanging off the rim again. Keep it down Donovan!
That‚Äôs why Donovan Mitchell is not on all star 1-2and 3 team. Trash!
Luka Doncic much harder to guard than Donovan Mitchell
"""Is that the guy you want taking that shot""    *one Donovan Mitchell brick later*     I think it is"
"Moderna would be a good thing tho (like Pfizer P), it has to be a virus/disease. Meningitis Mitchell, Malaria Mitchell, Diseased Donovan?"
"Donovan Mitchell choked, jesus"
Typical Donovan Mitchell hero ball. Yuck
Donovan Mitchell or Carlton Banks?
Donovan Mitchell going to Shanghai next season after that three
Nephews were really asking if Donovan Mitchell was better than dwade
Everyone blaming Gobert but Donovan Mitchell is a bad liability on defense. Man doesn‚Äôt even try causing Rudy to step out and then the Clippers just swing it to the open man over and over again
I wonder if Donovan Mitchell feels a lot of pressure being the most talented player on the court in this series
Here we go donovan mitchell time
 &gt;He‚Äôs out there hugging Donovan Mitchell only to learn that Mitchell is positive so Chris Paul is in limbo waiting for his tests to come back.  Anybody else here the Curb Your Enthusiasm music play after reading this?
Reggie Jackson &gt; Donovan Mitchell
They've got no starting PG and Donovan Mitchell can't beat anyone off the dribble. They're low on options
Jazz fans should blame Stephen A Smith. They haven't won since he said Donovan Mitchell is the greatest Jazz player of all time.
Donovan Mitchell didn't have a bum ankle and Mike Conley was on the floor.
"Donovan Mitchell shouldn‚Äôt be playing with how bad his ankle is, look at his production.  You wouldn‚Äôt say Kawhi was choking if he tried to play through his injury.  And conley has missed the whole series...."
Donovan Mitchell is still playing.
Is Donovan Mitchell going to carry this team right now?
Donovan Mitchell can barely walk
Paul George &gt; Donovan Mitchell
I like Donovan Mitchell
Donovan Mitchell can really only go right
donovan mitchell looks soft rn
Who the fuck is Donovan Mitchell
Oh shit‚Ä¶ Donovan Mitchell is on this team too?!
Lol I'm just trying to figure out why Donovan Mitchell is still here
"Donovan Mitchell has attempted two shot and the Jazz have made 3,983 three-pointers and it‚Äôs somehow a single digit game."
Donovan Mitchell washed.
Donovan Mitchell and the boys are clipping the Clippers wings üòà
"Donovan Mitchell only 3 points, and only up 1. If PG doesn't keep it up, this'll get ugly."
Maybe Donovan Mitchell really did get snubbed
Him and giannis are just taller and more athletic versions of draymond. They work well when they are asked to be the defensive anchor and point forward. You cant ask them to score for you in big moments though. They would look much better if they were next to a donovan mitchell or jamal murray type of guard.
Holy fuck Donovan Mitchell is straight nasty with that triple
Donovan Mitchell is moving up the list of my favorite players.
when you study for Donovan Mitchell and Joe Ingles but get Royce O'Neal on the exam
Donovan Mitchell or Trae Young
"Lots of teams have better players than Jaylen Brown. Is there a reason why you feel like he is the most coveted trade asset in the league? Those picks are something, but they're not great. Lots of teams could trade their best player. The Jazz could offer Donovan Mitchell, the Bucks could offer Giannis, the Hawks could offer Trae, the Sixers could offer Embiid, etc. All those teams would almost certainly rather have Luka than those guys.   But even if we're going with the assumption that teams won't trade legit All NBA talent for Luka (which is a poor assumption, IMO), the Thunder could trade SGA, Dort and like 15 picks, or the Pelicans could trade Ingram and like 10 picks. Those packages leave the Celtics in the dust. Sorry."
"Donovan Mitchell furiously designing more ""Rookie"" hoodies"
"Kawhi and Kyrie suffered in-game injuries. So did Lebron, who wasn't load-managing (i.e. not worried about over-use) prior to his injury. Harden has a bad hamstring - he came into training camp in poor shape, part of trying to force a trade. Is anyone really surprised that this is lingering on for him?  You call me dense, but what exactly is your argument here?  NBA basketball comes with the risk of leg injuries. Kyrie came down on Giannis' foot and rolled his ankle. The same thing that happened to Donovan Mitchell. The same thing that happened to Ja Morant in the 2nd game of the season.  Kawhi bumped knees with Joe Ingles. Joel Embiid landed awkwardly.   These are natural basketball injuries. You cannot blame the schedule for them.  Yes, Jamal Murray hurt his ACL on a non-contact play, and AD seemed to have an over-use injury. They are two of the more injury-prone players in the league. I don't really think you should point to those two and say ""SEE, WE KNEW IT!"""
Donovan Mitchell is literally in the playoffs. He‚Äôs playing tonight.
"LeBron, Anthony Davis, CP3, Doncic, Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley, Jamal Murray, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Joel Embiid all either missed playoff games or have played/are still playing injured.  Kawhi now joins the list.  OP: ""Are the Clippers cursed?""  Lol.  No.  There have been many key injuries during these playoffs."
No fucking way man. First CP3 and now Leonard? Apparently Donovan Mitchell is banged up too. Keep all the ACLs and ankles in your thoughts.
"What's crazy is we still have another month of these playoffs left, and with all the injuries piling up it's gonna put even more strain on the guys who are left. Like look at KD playing 48 minutes last night. Is that sustainable? He too missed a lot of the season with a strained calf. What kind of an injury is Donovan Mitchell playing on right now? How much more can Embiid's knee take?"
Anthony Davis - Groin - LIMITED    LeBron James - Ankle - LIMITED    Chris Paul - Shoulder/COVID-19 -LIMITED    Joel Embiid - Meniscus tear - LIMITED    Luka Doncic - Neck - LIMITED    Donovan Mitchell - Ankle - LIMITED    Donte DiVencenzo - Foot - OUT    Jaylen Brown - Torn ligament - OUT    Jamal Murray - ACL - OUT    Kawhi Leonard - Knee - LIMITED    Mike Conley - Hamstring - OUT         Did I miss anyone?
"And that tournament was over 2 years ago lol and as I had said the best player listed on there was a 22 year old Donovan Mitchell. There was no Lebron, Steph, KD , Hardin, Kyrie, etc."
"Just to add a couple for the Jazz.   Mike Conley - Hammy  Donovan Mitchell - Ankle (Playing through, but hurt a bit)"
This is the equivalent of Shaq saying he's being a dick to Donovan Mitchell just to motivate him.
&gt; Donovan Mitchell didn't make the all star team this year  Donovan Mitchell did make the all star game this year.
Donovan Mitchell was the 3rd best player on his team in the regular season.
[KD last May](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2891724-nets-kevin-durant-on-positive-covid-19-test-im-alive-thats-itim-good)   [Westbrook](https://www.nba.com/news/russell-westbrook-says-he-tested-positive-coronavirus)  [Donovan Mitchell](https://www.nba.com/news/donovan-mitchell-interview-says-asymptomatic)
8 all stars should be enough to compete: - Kawhi - Mike Conley - Donovan Mitchell - Joel Embiid - James Harden - Kyrie Irving - Anthony Davis - Chris Paul
And? All star voting is kind of bogus. I mean Donovan Mitchell didn't make the all star team this year and he is hands down a better player than dlo
hasn't donovan mitchell scored 30 in like 7 straight
Do the names Donovan Mitchell or Mike Conley mean anything to you?
"Based on their listed positions, you have Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, Jaylen Brown, Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook, Zach Lavine, and Jrue Holiday contending for the two spots in a hypothetical 5th team. One of those players is going to be relegated to the 8th team All-NBA. The guard talent in the NBA is insane right now."
"Giannis is out of my top 10. I got Bron (he‚Äôs gonna be healthy next year so I know he‚Äôs gonna have a MVP year), KD, Steph, Kawhi, Jokic, AD, Harden, Embiid, Dame, Luka, Donovan Mitchell, Tatum &amp; Booker all ahead of him man. Embiid is playing with a meniscus tear &amp; still is playing better than bul (he can‚Äôt really get to his spots rn because his knee is cooked). All these players that I named are better him are winning yesterday‚Äôs game because they‚Äôre not scared to shoot free throws, have more complete scoring games &amp; can operate in the post. Giannis should be a #2 option on a championship team, he‚Äôs too limited to lead a championship team. It‚Äôs no way you can tell me 24, 25 &amp; 26 year old LeBron wouldn‚Äôt be on a 3Peat currently with these past 3 year Bucks teams Giannis has had. Hell if LeBron could‚Äôve got Michael Redd to sign with cheap ass Cleveland he probably could‚Äôve won 2 championships there, Giannis ain‚Äôt that guy."
Bro we‚Äôre really gonna get the Nets big 3 vs Donovan Mitchell and Joe Ingles in the Finals smh
"Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, Paul George, Randle all had worse seasons than Jayson Tatum and Donovan Mitchell not to mention that Tatum literally had more All-NBA votes than Kyrie Irving"
There‚Äôs this great documentary on HBO about the day the sports world shut down in March 2020 because of Covid and Chris Paul is basically the main character. He‚Äôs out there hugging Donovan Mitchell only to learn that Mitchell is positive so Chris Paul is in limbo waiting for his tests to come back. KAT also shows up talking about his mother. The logistics of the Bubble are also mentioned. Great documentary all around
Yeah looking at the roster the only player that‚Äôs an all star IMO was a 22 year Donovan Mitchell. Harrison Barnes was a starter on that team.
"You don‚Äôt believe Mitchell is the best player for the Jazz? If Mitchell isn‚Äôt who do you think is cause as great of a defender as Rudy over, I think Donovan brings more to the table overall"
"With Giannis, the Bucks desperately need a guard that can create. Middleton can do it some, but he's Paul George if PG was tasked with being Kawhi.   -  This team with Donovan Mitchell/Trae/CP3, etc for example instead of Holiday would be a completely different animal"
"I'd disagree with that, but I can see why you make that case. Having Gobert definitely changes the way they play defensively, but he has almost no impact on the other side. You can't go to him like you could, say, prime Dwight Howard on the Magic and have him give you 25.  If you don't have Donovan Mitchell I just don't know if they have the same trajectory as they had the last couple of years, which lead them to being the number 1 seed in the whole league.  Regardless of all of that, I think we can both agree he should've been All-NBA."
Don‚Äôt forget Donovan Mitchell and Embiid off the bench
"Seth Curry  But more serious options are Embiid, Donovan Mitchell, Booker, CP, Trae Young"
"There is nothing more they could/should do from a roster standpoint. It‚Äôs on Giannis.   Lebron took far less to the finals, twice (Cleveland first stint and Cleveland final year)  This roster is comparable to the Raptors with kawhi     It‚Äôs a better roster than Philly, who will probably at least reach the ECF  Hell look at Donovan Mitchell.   I don‚Äôt wanna hear about coaching or supporting cast. We need to dead that thinking that‚Äôs so pervasive in sports. Stars aren‚Äôt mandated to make it. You gottta earn it. And if you don‚Äôt, it is NOT always everyone else‚Äô fault.   Ironically the same thing is happening woth thr Milwaukee football team. Aaron Rodgers has an elite HOF WR, LT, pro bowl RB, all pro DB, decent enough defense, HE comes up short making bad plays in the redzone (like Giannis in crunch time), yer the media fueled narrative is ‚Äòwhat can they do to get him some *help*‚Äô"
"As a Celtics fan and as much as I love Tatum, I have to disagree. Donovan Mitchell was the best player on the best team in the entire NBA and somehow he isn't All-NBA.   That's ridiculous."
No I'd consider Donovan Mitchell one though
"That list is based on old data (before '19-20 season). In the most recent one, his projection is much higher, right around where Donovan Mitchell is (and yes, above Capela).  https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nba-player-projections/"
The team that doesn't have Donovan Mitchell
Counterpoint: clips on Donovan Mitchell and Luka doncic. It worked well
Idk what Donovan Mitchell has to do to get the respect he deserve‚Ä¶.
How is it possible that Donovan Mitchell is not on any of the lists.  This man literally is the best player on the best regular season team in the league.  Its a hard list to make this year but you'd think someone like that would be in by default.  I would take Kyrie off and add Donovan.
"Soo. Steph Curry who couldn't even make it into the playoffs. Lebron James who barely played and is hobbled and Julius Randle who may be good but no love for Trae Young or Donovan Mitchell?  Luka Doncic who can't get out of the first rd?  I whole-heartedly disagree with HALF of this list.  Oh yeah, did I miss Kevin Durant????!!!  Who picks Playoff P over KD?  No Booker?"
Clippers better be ready tomorrow. Donovan Mitchell is going to want to cook after this snub.
"Yeah, like look at Trae Young or Donovan Mitchell or Zion or Lavine or Tatum's stats this year. 90% of the time, they'd make one of these teams. Even DeRozan, Middleton, Bam, and Ingram would've been close. This year was just nuts."
donovan mitchell or cp3
"&gt;With Luka clearly being the most valuable player in the NBA from a Front Office standpoint, who is the second most valuable player in the league?  &gt;A few things matter to this I feel. Age, offensive skill, defensive skill, contract, and that x-factor.  &gt;Candidate wise a few guys come to mind. Jayson Tatum, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Zion Williamson, LeBron James, Devin Booker, and Donovan Mitchell  &gt;Who do you guys think the second most valuable player is in the NBA and if you have the time, why?  &gt;Edit: I forgot Jokic"
"Still having nightmares of seeing Donovan Mitchell being switched on Melo, getting abused by Portland high screen and roll, watching Adams get heavy minutes against a centerless Houston while not able to score, and all of this repeatedly thru a series. in general not making any adjustments until it‚Äôs elimination game"

There‚Äôs no way Trae is an inch taller than Donovan Mitchell
"&gt; But he never said that he‚Äôs not a star, he said that he‚Äôs not a superstar.  Again, the issue isn't Shaq not thinking he's a superstar.  I'd frankly agree that he isn't on that level yet.  It's Shaq saying to his face that he doesn't have what it takes to get to that level.  Which is frankly a dick move, and which was obviously Shaq trying to 'provoke' him into becoming one so he could take credit.  Which he's already trying to do.    And going further, shit, the product is supposed to be about the stars of today.  Shaq's retired and is a basketball analyst: dude shouldn't be making it about himself.    &gt;I‚Äôm only talking about his overall take on Mitchell.  I've got no issue with his take on Mitchell (basically, that he's not a superstar), and as I've said I agree with that take.    I do have issue with his blatantly trying to take credit, his attention whoring, his pettiness, and his basically just being insecure AF.    &gt;I meant nobody in this specific thread  Sure, because his whole endgame was obvious from the start.  But his whole plan to take credit being obvious shouldn't mean we can't criticize him for it.    &gt;Yeah once again it‚Äôs less about Joe and more about the fan reaction.   Again though, Joe was clearly joking.  And if you want to bring up Ingles' Tweets / IG posts we'd then have to bring up Shaq's drama on IG, which is unequivocally worse.    &gt;so we would see an even larger ‚Äúremember when Jazz fans were mad Shaq said Donovan isn‚Äôt a superstar lololol‚Äù  That'd be a massive misrepresentation of what actually happened, but honestly we're pretty used to that from this sub at this point."
"But he never said that he‚Äôs not a star, he said that he‚Äôs not a superstar. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs disrespectful considering how high the standard is to be considered one. Shaq admitted he was saying it to ‚Äúpush him‚Äù towards greatness, but that means he really does hold the opinion that he‚Äôs not at that level, which is what I‚Äôm saying is fair.  Exactly so I‚Äôm not arguing that he was in the right for being unprofessional and doing that, I‚Äôm only talking about his overall take on Mitchell.  I meant nobody in this specific thread, as in thats not what I‚Äôm arguing here. I‚Äôm only saying that it‚Äôs best to take the legitimate criticism (that Donovan isn‚Äôt a superstar) in stride and wait til the Jazz/Donovan prove him wrong in the playoffs.   Yeah once again it‚Äôs less about Joe and more about the fan reaction. Because people already love going overboard on their judgments of a player after 1 bad game let alone a playoff shortcoming, so we would see an even larger ‚Äúremember when Jazz fans were mad Shaq said Donovan isn‚Äôt a superstar lololol‚Äù if he were to play poorly in the playoffs this year. Which it seems like you agree with."
"lol 40% FGs isn‚Äôt even that bad, 9 turnovers is not a good look, but you just look like an absolute idiot claiming that Donovan Mitchell choked that series."
"&gt; Honestly the best course of action for Jazz fans is just to take legit criticism (which I would apply to the Mitchell take, not the Gobert one) in stride for now.   It wasn't legit criticism though.  That's kind of the issue here.  Shaq's whole plan, and it was blatantly obvious from the start, was to criticize Donovan and take credit for whatever improvement happened afterwards.  He's literally done so in the linked interview.    Dude's a legend, but he's full of shit, and has been for years now.    FWIW, I agree that we aren't contenders until we prove it.  That doesn't mean that if we make a deep run this season it'll be down to fucking Shaq, and you damn well know his petty ass is going to try to take credit.    &gt;all this talking they did in response to Shaq will come back to hurt them.  The players haven't responded though.  Unless you count ""Aight"" as a response."
"The Jazz wouldn‚Äôt even have got to Game 7 without him. Are you saying Donovan Mitchell choked by averaging 36/5/5 on 70% TS, and joined Michael Jordan and Allen Iverson as the only players to score more than 50 points twice in a playoff series? You are a certified hater my man, I don‚Äôt know how Donovan hurt you, but he did."
"Shaq told Donovan Mitchell he doesn‚Äôt think he‚Äôs got what it takes because of ‚Äúembarrassing early playoff exits‚Äù, despite his last series loss (as the lower seed, so embarrassing) putting up 36/5/5 on 70% TS with multiple 50 point games?  Yeah ok my guy."
"Kyrie and Harden are going to be targeted in drop coverage come playoff time, it's the same thing the Rockets did year after year to Donovan Mitchell/Joe Ingles with Capela in the PNR"
"uhhhh just off the top of my head, here are my picks:  Donovan Mitchell Rudy Gobert Royce O‚Äôneale Mike Conley Bojan Bogdanovic"
Why is Donovan Mitchell the thumbnail?
Donovan Mitchell is Spida
"Now that I think about it, they've been eliminated in the Playoffs plenty of times because of the midrange. I remember CP doing it to them over the years, and now Jokic. They'll have to face Jokic, Bron, Kawhi, AD, and some other stars that are good at the midrange. So, I'm really curious to see if they can actually defend them. If not, I don't see them doing much damage. Also, Donovan Mitchell needs to be far more consistent."
"Any chance that Ja Morant gets a nod as a wildcard? If there's an emphasis on winning teams then let me remind you that the Grizzlies are the fourth seed right now.  Ja Morant: 20.7/2.1/7.7 on .539/.300/.806 (2.9 3PA). The rebounding and 3-point percentage is suspect, but for a guard he's scoring very efficiently from the field.   If the guards are locked up between Dame, Steph, Luka and Donovan Mitchell then I could see someone trying to make an argument for Ja over someone like Devin Booker for a wildcard. Also for what it's worth, SGA and DeAaron Fox are playing pretty hot right now and are putting up statlines similar to Booker but they're both on losing teams.  For what it's worth, I just don't see either Mike Conley or CP3 making it this year. Not at 16 PPG."
"oooh yeah, rough stuff.  That trade was bad when it happened and only looks worse now.  He also gave Bismack Biyombo all that $$$ in free-agency, didn't he?  Looking at his draft record, he actually did okay all things considered.  I liked the Aaron Gordon pick at the time (and it's been written about that they really wanted Porzingis who went just before their pick), I was frustrated that he didn't make it to the Celtics that year.  Hezonja looks rough now but he was highly regarded coming into the draft.  Jonathan Isaac instead of Donovan Mitchell isn't looking great, but again at the time Isaac was a much more highly regarded prospect than Mitchell was.     Well whatever happens hopefully the Magic can turn it around.  Maybe this year they'll embrace a tank with a strong draft class and minimal revenue to be lost from attendance and they can build something new from the ground up."
Malik showing the world why he got drafted before Donovan Mitchell. Hornets fans love to see it!
"PG: Luka, Ja, Trae, De'Aaron Fox, a future player.  SG: Jaylen Brown. Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Donovan Mitchell, Future player  SF: Jayson Tatum, De'Andre Hunter, Keldon Johnson, 2 future players  PF: Giannis, AD, Sabonis, John Collins, Kristaps Porzingis  C: Jokic, Embiid, Bam Adebayo, James Wiseman, a future player"
"Who is he pushing out  West starters Steph Curry/Damien Lillard/Leonard/LeBron/Jokic  Backups Donovan Mitchell/Doncic/PG13/AD/Gobert  For the final two spots he needs to beat all but one of Karl Anthony Towns, SGA, De'Aron Fox, Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram, Christian Wood, Ja Morant  On his own team Wall, Wood, and Gordon are all better than him too"
"Hey its me. Bit late but hopefully the nephews in 6 years will have the patience to scroll down to see the hot takes  PG - Luka, Trae, Ja, Sexton, Lamelo (burning hot take there that definitely won't backfire)  SG - Donovan Mitchell, Booker, Murray, Beal, Lavine  SF - Tatum, Ingram, Jaylen Brown, LeBrons corpse, Wiggins  PF - Giannis, AD, Zion, Sabonis, Simmons (he's a power forward who just likes playing at point guard shoot me),   C - Jokic, Embiid, Bam, KAT, Gobert/Sabonis"
"Well there‚Äôs always gonna be a few guys who aren‚Äôt even in the league right now so doing all 5 for each is a waste of time   But   PG : Luka, Trae, Ja   SG: Donovan Mitchell, Booker   SF: MPJ, Jaylen Brown,   PF: Zion, Tatum, Giannis   C: Jokic, Bam   Left some blanks where I think a player who‚Äôs not in the league will take that spot"
"Bradley Beal, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Zach LaVine, Jayson Tatum, Nikola Jokic, CJ McCollum, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, James Harden, Collin Sexton, Zion Williamson, Christian Wood, Brandon Ingram, Jerami Grant, Gordon Hayward, Devin Booker, Malcolm Brogdon, Donovan Mitchell, Nikola Vucevic, Julius Randle, Anthony Davis, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Khris Middleton, De'Aaron Fox, Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Tobias Harris, Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell (Bam Adebayo, DeMar DeRozan, and Pascal Siakam are all above 19.5).   How many players there aren't ""real"" 20-point scorers? All of them have done it before."
"RAPTOR has CJ 7th with Capela, ahead of Lebron, AD, Gobert, KD. It also has Jordan Clarkson and Fred VanVleet as the 15th and 16th most impactful players, above Steph and Beal. It also has Patty Mills ahead of Giannis, Jaylen Brown, Tatum, and Lillard. What an accurate statistic! Advanced stats are meaningless, just use your eyes and you can see Lebron is clearly the most impactful player in the league  edit: Not to mention Shake Milton, Delon Wright, Terry Rozier, Bobby Portis, and Monte Morris have a higher RAPTOR than Donovan Mitchell despite him playing with Conley like you said. Since RAPTOR is such a good stat, Utah's GM should have been fired yesterday for giving 82nd best player in the NBA a max contract when he's no better than Josh Hart."
Donovan Mitchell
 it‚Äôs literally only 4 guys    Michael Jordan - VS Cleveland 1988  Allen Iverson - VS Toronto 2001  Jamal Murray - VS Utah 2020  Donovan Mitchell - VS Denver 2020
"There‚Äôs more talent in the league than ever . A lot of it is hype but I think it‚Äôs fair to put the generational tag on players who are a couple of tiers above the rest   For example , I think Lamelo is the best player in the draft by a pretty good length . But last year , was mostly hype since you couldn‚Äôt say the same for Zion and the rest of his class . Ben Simmons was different since he was red shirted for a year  , and he is still a jump shot away from being Lebron James and was very obviously a cut above the 2017 rookie class, even Donovan Mitchell"
"So y‚Äôall will bitch and moan about Shaq saying the same truth about Donovan Mitchell, but in this instance is okay?  /r/nba is full of hypocritical pussies"
lol If Donovan Mitchell in that series isn't a special circumstance I don't know what is.
"This was your original comment:  &gt; Hating him is reasonable because he made a corny ‚Äúcoach‚Äù comment to Donovan Mitchell?  It's a ""spin"" because you only mentioned 1 thing on a larger list/picture and pretended that's the only reason people are hating on him.  He's getting hated on cause he took it way further than that AND wasn't cool to Jokic.  Only listing 1 reason he got bad press when you know for a fact there is more than that is, like, the definition of trying to spin something, haha.  Come on dude.    I don't have a hate boner, i literally never made a comment about shaq during the whole month.  I'm just pointing out that your defense of him is really dumb and you aren't acknowledging the actual, legitimate reasons he was being criticized."
Hating him is reasonable because he made a corny ‚Äúcoach‚Äù comment to Donovan Mitchell?
Kelenna Azubuike back in 2K11 played like Donovan Mitchell for me dude. Wrecked my friend‚Äôs shit every time lol.
"&gt;But our worst player was Donovan tonight and i bet you didn‚Äôt even know that.  Congratulations, not only did your 28M ""DPOY"" not help in the one area you paid him 28M for but Mitchell had a bad game üôÑ  People might actually give a shit if you weren't paying a center 28M to play ""defense"" and set screens just to allow the opposing big to drop 47...."
"Okay boys you know the drill.  Jazz are frauds, Gobert is nothing more than a glorified Baguette Biyombo, Shaq was right about Donovan Mitchell, etc."
Damn wtf I'm guessing it has to do with Donovan Mitchell more than Gobert tho
Donovan has over 1000 more career points and has more rebounds and assists than Murray. Murray has been in the league longer. Mitchell is easily a tier above Murray.
Booker is 47TS% in the 4th. Bradley beal is 45 TS%. Jamal Murray is 44 TS%. Donovan Mitchell is 52 TS%. Kawhi is 49TS%. AD is 51%. Lebron is 53TS%.  Jaylen Brown is 48TS%.   I will tell them their stats don't matter if they aren't efficient in the 4th lol.
*angry Donovan Mitchell noises*
Reminiscent of Donovan Mitchell. I‚Äôve watched him shoot the jazz out of a ton of games. His first couple years in the league he was just chucking late in games. And he‚Äôs a much better shooter than Luka.
"I had included the 2018-2019 season as well where he played 67 games above..  In the 2017-2018 season, he shot 61.6 % on 4.7 attempts. Holiday shot 64.4 % on 5.3 attempts. Oladipo shot 66.8 % on 5.1 attempts. Donovan Mitchell shot 61.7 % on 5.0 attempts. John Wall shot 61.5 % on 5.5 attempts. Harden shot 62.4 % on 62.4 attempts."
"&gt; #22. Connecticut &gt;Starting 5: Kris Dunn, Donovan Mitchell   Mitchell is from New York, or at least grew up here."
"That‚Äôs exactly why Bud needs to switch it up. In any other season our defense would be amazing, like it was before the Bubble.  But we‚Äôve seen the likes of Jamal Murray, Anthony Davis, Donovan Mitchell, Damian Lillard, etc all improve as a product of the bubble and the Bucks are caught in the cross-fire.  The heat are an excellent shooting team, but they do not hit those many threes when there‚Äôs fans, especially as the Bucks have HC advantage"
"Mate let's say the Utah Jazz. They are #1 seed in the west while also #1 in 3pts shot. Say Rudy Goburt can slow down Giannis, wtf is the bucks gonna do? Mitchell of Donovan, Boojon Marijuanavic, Clarkson are all 3 pts specialist that can get hot and drop 30 pts at any time. What the frick is Buds gonna do? Instead of doing the right thing and start contesting 3s, just camp the paint out. This isn't the era where big ass centers can't shoot 3 anymore. You got AD, KAT, Embiid, Jokic, Vucavec that can shoot 3s relatively well. Now think about the guards that can shoot wells, Jamal Murray of Roy, Curry, Dame... I can go on and on. Not DEFENDING the 3 pt shot is not how u win games, not in this era. It may work when Shaq was still on the Lakers, not now."
"Well the justification is there - it lies right in the advanced stats.   The objective reality is that he probably won‚Äôt be, because of precisely what you outlined in the post.  Realistically, Donovan Mitchell and maybe Rudy get in as reserves for the jazz. Bc they have precedent and Donny especially has the counting stats.  But I can tell you matter-of-factly Conley is more deserving, more impactful, and has been consistently good every game, whereas Donovan has had off nights where he has not played well, particularly the first few weeks"
Niang gave himself that nickname when he referenced that he was a minivan compared to the ferrari that is Donovan Mitchell.
"How so? Dame his first 3 years was essentially just Donovan with passing  Dame's TS%, BPM, and WS/48 were all significantly higher too. The only thing Mitchell has on him is volume of scoring - and given his massive uptick his 4th year, it's just because he had LMA there"
Donovan Mitchell is clearly the Jazz best player
Since when is 56% TS% awful lol. It's like league average  Like Donovan Mitchell is at 4 straight seasons under that mark
"Nah, Gobert is playing insane but Embiid and Jokic have also been great. They've both currently top 5 in most people's MVP voting, with Embiid doing it on both ends of the floor.  Donovan Mitchell could get in given golden state, Dallas, and Atlanta aren't top of the conference. I'd say Mitchell has a legitimate shot but unless Gobert is putting up 23/4/2 while being the clear cut DPOY he's not making 1st team over those 2"
Or Donovan Mitchell. We are not trying to be nitpicking here.
Neither is Donovan Mitchell. Sure a player of that type is hypothetically more valuable then player like Rudy gobert but your forgetting the context of Donovan Mitchell being a lower end all star.
"I love Jimmy Butler but look at the follow up that this guy was saying. He was saying there were no championship level teams in the east last season and that was absolutely untrue  Donovan Mitchell is totally capable of being that jimmy butler level guy for the Jazz in the playoffs, where he seemingly turned on god mode last playoffs. It literally took Jamal Murray also going god mode to stop him."
"Something that has plagued us for years is finishing close games.  Mitchell and Bogey have had their share of buzzer beaters for us, but the way Quin's blender works, we feed the open man. In the big moments I feel many of our players struggle with confidence. I've also seen Donovan try to do too much in final possessions, most recently our second to last possession against you guys in game 7 where Donovan got stripped by Gary Harris.  Of our players right now, I really trust Conley, Bogey, Ingles and Favors in those final possessions the most. They just make the right play and rarely get rattled.   That all said, it's easy for our whole team to play well when we're up double digits in the fourth. Despite this very impressive run, I'll have a lot more confidence in our potential if I can see us win some more close games."
Playoff Donovan Mitchell was Supersaiyan tho... so i don't think its THAT unrealistic to see them go all the way
Don't forget we have a great 3rd option in Donovan Mitchell as well.
Yeah Donovan Mitchell has had big playoff games but if I'm going into a pivotal game 5 in a series I'm taking KD/Harden or Lebron/ad or Kawhi/Pg every time.
This is gonna be like the pistons taking Luke Kennard over Donovan Mitchell isn‚Äôt it...
"If you don't mind me asking, cuz I'm new to the NBA. Donovan Mitchell is the third option? I thought he was the first/second with Gobert"
"In the past year the owner has stepped back from meddling and actually allowed the new GM (Troy Weaver who was an assistant GM with the Thunder) do an actual full rebuild. The Gores meddling is part of the reason the team had been so bad. He had a playoffs or bust mentality and forced a lot of the bad moves the team made without taking the blame.   Gores told Dumars he had to get stars when he first arrived which led to us signing Josh Smith (because realistically what legit star is coming to Detroit in free agency) and forced the Brandon Knight Kris Middleton for Brandon Jennings trade (Dumars was very high on Middleton and thought he had the chance to be good but playoffs and win now takes precedent right). After he fired Dumars instead of hiring a coach and GM that might develop a young core (Drummond, Dinwiddie, and KCP all looked promising at the time) he hired Stan Van Gundie to be the Coach/GM and told him we where a win now team.   Obviously a lot of stuff happened over the Van Gundy years but I think the most obvious ways Gores win now directive hurt us where the Stanley Johnson pick, Blake Griffin trade, and Luke Kennard pick. Long story short Johnson was picked over better players because he played NBA level defense and was considered the best option to help the team immediately (tbf he looked decent in that playoff series his 1st year). Kennard was picked over Donovan Mitchell because Kennard shot well and would help the team immediately. Where as Mitchell was seen by the franchise as someone that would take sometime to develop. While Blake Griffin was traded for because Gores told Van Gundy playoffs or bust and he was trying to save his job. Gores meddling has hurt the team for years and was a major reason we couldn't rebuild.  Recently though Gores has stepped back and has allowed to Troy Weaver to start a full rebuild which is refreshing to see. Also Weaver got Sadiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart in his 1st draft who both look to be good. Hayes looks bad right now but he was supposed to be project so I'm not worried yet. Last year the Pistons got Doumbouya who has potential. Also n free agency Weaver signed Josh Jackson who was showing flashes of a breakout with us before his injury. As well as Jerami Grant who is showing that he can be a legitimately great player. This is honestly the most excited I've been about the Pistons in years.  Also the Pistons are managing to tank while being super competitive in the games they've played. They had 3 bad losses to Milwaukee but other than that everyone game has come down to the wire. I know Pistons fans keep saying this but they're not nearly as bad as their record indicates and looking at net ratings shows that [bbref](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_ratings.html). They're 17th in the leauge in adjusted Net Rating and they're 22nd if you use [NBA.com's](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced/?sort=NET_RATING&amp;dir=-1) unadjusted Net rating. Basically we get to watch competitive basketball while the team is tanking and I'm really happy about that. I also like the moves Weaver has made and think he is a good GM. So I'm happy about the future."
"&gt; Those 2019 moves to invest in offense (not having the firepower for 2 years vs the Rockets in the playoffs)   It was shooting, more than anything. We effectively replaced Rubio &amp; Crowder (good players but not exactly good shooters) with Conley &amp; Bogdanovic (two excellent shooters).  Prior to that we were running lineups where we literally had three non shooters in Gobert, Rubio, &amp; Crowder, which obviously screwed up our spacing and left us relying on Donny bailing out possessions a *lot*.  We simply didn't have enough weapons on offense, and it lead to offenses in the playoffs effectively keying in on Donny and shutting us down.    Our bench offense was also very weak, and the Clarkson trade (and our re-signing him this offseason) was lowkey as important as any moves we've made.    Now we've got, essentially, a roster of two very good defensive bigs in Gobert &amp; Faves, both of whom are active screeners and roll threats, and 6 good shooters we can put around those guys in Mitchell, Conley, Bogdanovic, Clarkson, O'Neale, &amp; Ingles.  It lets us keep playing the same system when Gobert sits, whereas last season we tried doing it with Ed Davis and Tony Bradley, and that didn't go well.  And of those 6 shooters, the first four are good creators, so it's no longer a matter of shutting down Donovan to shut down the Jazz offense.    The roster is ridiculously well constructed to fit Snyder's system.  Only thing I'd ask for is another good wing defender or two for the LA matchups in the playoffs, but that's probably asking a bit too much."
"Utah Jazz general manager Justin Zanik proudly waited outside the locker room after the final buzzer to give Rudy Gobert and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Friday evening. Injured guard Donovan Mitchell yelled out, ‚ÄúAight. That's it.‚Äù Sharpshooter Bojan Bogdanoviƒá gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Mike Conley yelled out, ‚ÄúWe got a [expletive] squad now.‚Äù And before Gobert hit the locker room door, former NBA great Carlos Boozer hugged him and said, ‚ÄúAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.‚Äù"
I actually hope Bubble Donovan‚Ñ¢Ô∏è doesn't show up. If he does it means no one else is scoring. I'd rather have an above average game for him than a ISO Mitchell scenario.
"JAZZ-VENGERS ASSEMBLE - Donovan ""Captain America"" Mitchell"
The Jazz are the real deal! Doing all of this without their star Donovan Mitchell!
Could you imagine if this team signed someone like Donovan Mitchell?
"[Bro Donovan met with Kamala Harris](https://www.nba.com/jazz/news/donovan-mitchell-discusses-voting-education-and-police-reform-vp-candidate-kamala-harris) (along with CJ McCollum and Tobias Harris) to discuss voting, education, and police reform. He was one of the biggest people involved in the Say Her Name efforts for Breonna Taylor. If that ain't social justice I don't know what is."
"Dame is Dame, but Donovan Mitchell could be anything!   He could even be Dame!"

"Players score points, teams get wins.    Luka and curry aren‚Äôt playing with Donovan Mitchell or Rudy Gobert"
"The backlash has grown a lot recently with Shaq's recent ridiculous comments on Christian Wood, Rudy Gobert, and Donovan Mitchell, but yes there's a minority of us that dislike how low-level their commentary is and how they are *legitimately clueless about and apathetic at best towards* the modern NBA."
Ask playoff Donovan Mitchell   He put that dude in prison. Mitchell got his pts and stats but anyone who watched knows EG was shutting him down for the most part.
"Most likely to be named all stars in the West:  LeBron James  Donovan Mitchell  Kawhi Leonard  Paul George  Nikola Jokic  Steph Curry  Luka Doncic   Damian Lillard   That leaves 2 spots. But there's heavy competition for those with guys like Morant, Booker, SGA, McCollum, Anthony Davis, Fox (just to name a few)"
"I was just replying to someone else and I highlighted recency bias as well.  I originally had said he's been on the cast for like 5 years now and I didn't even realize til I googled it that he joined back in fucking 2011. I agree that something is off with his takes and criticisms this year but people are acting like Shaq just joined this year and has contributed nothing to the show ever and that he's always been shit.  He needs to tone it down a bit but to act like he needs to go or that the show is garbage with him is such an overreaction and it's starting to taint how people view him as a player. I've seen arguments now that Shaq isn't even a top 10 player of a top 5 big man of all time. ""He was just good because he was big""  People need to chill out a bit. Some backlash after Donovan Mitchell like incidents are deserved but to act like the man needs to be axed is a bit premature."
It‚Äôs going to take Donovan Mitchell going nuclear though to pull it off  Offensively he will have to carry in 7 game series against at least 2 elite teams  It‚Äôs a heavy ask
And he wasn't even really a dick.   He told Donovan Mitchell he was hard on him to get the most out of him and people took it the wrong way.
Shaq was a dick to Donovan Mitchell so now people don‚Äôt like it
"When we were up 25 during the 3rd quarter in OKC for game 5 of the 2018 first round matchup, looking to close out the series. Then 8 minutes later the lead was completely gone and we lost all momentum.      Thankfully the mood swung again pretty rapidly when Donovan Mitchell scored 38 in game 6 as we closed out the series at home."
"Jimmy Butler was certainly not known as a top 10 player before making the Finals. The Heat didn't win, but still, the narrative changes if you win in the playoffs. If the Jazz made the Finals or even won, Donovan Mitchell would become known as a top 10 player in the league"
"I never even said Joe Ingles was a primary facilitator, I said he can initiate the offense and can make plays for others, which he can. But if you think Donovan Mitchell is your best passer, you are seriously underrating what Mike Conley is actually doing for your team.  Again, nothing you said counter my argument about how Gobert brings something far more irreplaceable than Mitchell. I'm not saying Mitchell isn't a great player, but Utah is simply a talented team with guards and wings, and Rudy Gobert is a completely game changing defensive player and maybe one of these best pick and roll finishers in the league. Meanwhile, you have few other very good PnR ball handlers outside of Mitchell.  BTW: Ingles has averaged 5.2 assists over the last 4 years on less turnovers than Mitchell who has averaged 4.1 assists. For someone who's had the ball in his hands so much, he's not some type of elite passer for your team. Just look in the thread and see what most of your fellow Jazz fans are even saying."
"What Donovan Mitchell brings to the floor is far more replaceable than Gobert. Your entire defensive system rides on Gobert's presence as a rim protector. Utah has guards who can score and create shots with Conley and Clarkson. With a team with so many very good shooters, Conley's ability as a passer and getting guys in their spots is even more valuable than Mitchell's scoring. They also have a wing in Joe Ingles who can initiate the offense and make plays for others."
"every year jazz fans say this because of advanced stats. Yet 30/30 GMs in an NBA re-draft would place Donovan higher than mitchell. Every year Gobert gets figured out in the playoffs, and every year we rely on mitchell offensively. Mitchell is averaging 24/5/5. That's ridiculous and rare in today's nba. Rudy is incredible as well, but nah"
"You don't think Donovan Mitchell can be that guy? I'm genuinely asking, I don't follow the Jazz a lot, the last time I followed them was during the playoffs when he went super nova."
I was super excited when the Knicks hired Bryant. He‚Äôs the same guy who helped turn Hayward and Donovan Mitchell into stars.
"From a ""gut sense"" perspective, Mike Conley absolutely matches the stats, although I would probably pick Gobert as #1 and Conley as #2. Even though Donovan Mitchell is my favorite player in the league, I can always tell someone doesn't watch the Jazz if they think Donovan has been our best player so far."
"He's been horrible the last 2 years, and last year was because of injury. He really wasn't bad in the Jazz series. He almost forced a game 7 with PG scoring 5 points on 2-16 shooting in game 6 and Donovan Mitchell going off the entire series."
"Utah Jazz general manager Justin Zanik proudly waited outside the locker room after the final buzzer to give Rudy Gobert and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Wednesday evening. Injured guard Donovan Mitchell yelled out, ‚ÄúThere you go! There you go.‚Äù Sharpshooter Bojan Bogdanoviƒá gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Mike Conley yelled out, ‚ÄúWe got a \[expletive\] squad now.‚Äù And before Gobert hit the locker room door, former NBA great Carlos Boozer hugged him and said, ‚ÄúAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.‚Äù"
Have the fans said that Donovan Mitchell was torn up about the interview? It seems like everyone‚Äôs just saying that wasn‚Äôt right and shaq shouldn‚Äôt be shocked that Mitchell didn‚Äôt thank him for saying he‚Äôs not good enough. And plus I‚Äôve seen a lot of people call him sensitive over the gobert stuff
I have literally never seen Donovan Mitchell ever hunt for a foul
"Definitely the fans  I highly doubt Donovan is losing sleep over what Shaq, yet fans STILL bring it up till this day  They also pick and choose who to defend against Shaq. It wasn‚Äôt really a problem when he ridiculed Rudy Gobert and posted an IG pic of him dunking on Gobert, it was instead ‚Äúsavage‚Äù, now all of a sudden he crossed the line with Mitchell"
Embiid is just so hilarious to watch. He throws his arms up before it goes in. He makes basketball seem fun. The thing that honestly won me over on him was when he baited Donovan Mitchell into that tech
"So your analysis is based on ... what exactly? Your subjective opinion on handpicked games of playoff games?  A negative would be a player whose doing more harm than good.   You‚Äôre absolutely delusional if you think Russ hurt the team more than helped. The only case that can be made for that is the Lakers series. He was injured and came off COVID. They don‚Äôt beat the Lakers with him at full strength either way. Their fucking center is 6‚Äô6.   I don‚Äôt mind Russ criticism but the criticism always makes it seem like he‚Äôs the only AND the biggest problem.    Nothing is said about our lack of shooters in the Post-KD era. Nothing is said about Billy Donovan in the Post-KD era.   It‚Äôs always Russ, Russ, Russ. Isn‚Äôt it tiring for y‚Äôall lmfao...  He‚Äôs a player with flaws. Mitchell has flaws too but I doubt you‚Äôd take a superior player like Booker over him. With the NBA, you have to take the good with the bad. Especially when the good outweighs the bad. This type of analysis that focuses solely on bad poor performances or bad stats is so tired. We will literally get nowhere with progressing this conversation."
Donovan Mitchell  Devin Booker
"It's also arguably a detriment to the east in the long term, despite it making it easier to make the playoffs  In the west you can be a really good team and miss the playoffs, therefore keeping you in the lottery and picking higher than a much worse team (or teams) that makes the playoffs in the other conference  There have been multiple instances of this resulting in good teams drafting better players than their much worse opponents in the other conference. The Suns got TJ Warren and Devin Booker, the Nuggets got Donovan Mitchell (and then traded) and Michael Porter Jr, the Lakers ended up moving up for 4th in 2020. These teams are able to accumulate talent and win while keeping their pick higher  Meanwhile, teams like the Magic, haven't really won much at all, don't have a great roster, and their players 2nd contracts are ending or have ended. Yet, they still haven't had a high lottery pick since like 2017  Not to mention that by making it easier to make the playoffs with poorer rosters, it makes it more likely that ownership or management will settle or retain rosters that in the long term won't ever get out of the dreaded middle  All of this is likely why it has taken so long for the east to finally catch back up to the west, but even then the west is still deeper likely in part due to this higher level of play needed to compete."

"Christian Wood but he might actually still be underrated.      He's scoring more PPG than Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker and KAT.      He's rebounding more per game than Adams, AD, Lebron, Luka and Russ.      He's blocking more shots per game than Embiid, Lopez and Giannis"
"Always been a good scorer but this team fits him so well really allows him to leverage his traits and hide his weakness.    Also, as a lifelong Lakers fan, if makes me happy to see the young guys who were with us during the really dark times (zubac and thomas bryant also come to mind) playing competitive basketball and not be stuck in NBA purgatory.   He's really a great bench compliment to Donovan Mitchell.  You can rest Mitchell and still keep your game flow without not really changing much considering how similar they are on the offensive end (obv clarkson isn't as good) and defensive end."
"I mean the best way is to watch a team and then find one that you enjoy watching.   My personal recommendation would be the Utah Jazz. They've been in an awkward middle stage these past few years. Not bad, but not really contending. Either first or second round playoff exits. But this year they've started to connect all the pieces. One of the most exciting young stars in the league in Donovan Mitchell, a 2x defense player of the year in Rudy Gobert, memes galore in Ingles and Niang. They just got a new owner this year with money and is willing to spend to make this team great. Not to mention, we're on a hot streak right now playing the best basketball in the NBA, but by no means would you be a bandwagon for following the jazz. Dope uniforms, fun players, and a mastermind coach. We got 3s, Dunks, and Defense. Idk what more you'd need.  Other than that I'd probably say the Grizzlies. I just like J√° Morant."
No Donovan Mitchell tonight and so he absolutely stood up. At one stage across the end of the first quarter to midway through the second he scored 20 of our last 23 points to points. This is going to be a great game to build his 6MOTY case.    He's averaging 18 PPG on 48/39/97 shooting rn in just 25 minutes per game and in my mind is the undisputed front runner for the award.
Donovan Mitchell really found something in the bubble. He balling like 2006 Wade. 2009-2010 Wade is too high of a bar and Mitchell needs to prove more.

As a side note, if we are to use SD or IQR as a measure of a player's consistency, I would argue that standard deviation is the more accurate measure. This is because it accounts for all games, whereas IQR really only uses the 25th percentile and 75th percentile data. It is still early into the season which would cause some skewing of the values. As an example, if you've only played 16 games, the IQR would be the difference between your 4th highest scoring game and your 12th highest scoring game."

 Donovan Mitchell or Trae Young
"To be fair, it's an organization that helped build a legacy on great drafting.  It's not the most profitable franchise and it's not a guarantee that the fanbase will maintain any sort of interest in a tanking team.  Most fans aren't championship-or-bust minded.  There's something to be said for staying competitive and trying to pull a Shai Gilgeous Alexander, Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, Kawhi, Devin Booker or Michael Porter Jr. around the middle of the first round."
Jamal Murray maybe? Jaylen Brown? Donovan Mitchell? Devin Booker is probably the one
by that logic Donovan Mitchell should be MVP! Rudy Gobert should be MVP! Joe Ingles is in that discussion too
"I will say, I got a Donovan Mitchell jersey last month and he has played very good since. He played very good before that too but has played good since as well."
"Yeah I can't think of a single difference between Donovan Mitchell and Steph Curry, great point."
"Donovan Mitchell is a very good PG, perennial borderline all star. Some of these guards you listed are all timers. Hey maybe Mitchell will get to that point but I personally doubt it."
Donovan Mitchell is afraid of looking in mirrors after the sun goes down
"Oh, I dunno, maybe the people coming into the thread to talk about Donovan Mitchell?   I swear this thread has attracted the lowest IQ NBA fans."
"He had multiple 50 point games in the bubble. The Nuggets are my team, he‚Äôs been great, but he hasn‚Äôt been quite as good as the bubble. Though to be fair neither has Donovan Mitchell, so I think both are good answers in this thread."
"Yes, my kids will be arguing about Donovan Mitchell"

"I can‚Äôt not see this as random. It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs the only player in the league that plays the way he does. Harden, Kyrie, Luka, Donovan Mitchell, Giannis. Hell, even LeBron when he decides he wants to. So it shouldn‚Äôt matter.  A ton of players are rude towards  the media. LeBron has been a passive aggressive asshole for years and still manages to be a media darling.  Even guys that do stupid shit off the court skate compared to Russ. It‚Äôs really weird."

Donovan Mitchell
One of those games that reminds you how fucking awesome Donovan Mitchell is.
"Eh Donovan Mitchell's stats are far far worse than Steph and decently worse than Damian's. Like realistically speaking if the season ended right now there is no way in hell that Donovan Mitchell would end up above Curry.  For Kyrie the stats are similar enough, Steph is still better pretty much across the board while playing with a far worse team he's still more efficient. But I can understand how that's not factored into the algorithm."
DONOVAN MITCHELL BABY
Ehh I don't really agree with the comparison. Bucks got a hell of a lot more respect last year than the Jazz do this year. The only time I ever even see the Jazz mentioned is people either shitting on them or saying they have no legit shot. Bucks last year had plenty of weekly posts praising Giannis and his statlines or about how few losses they were racking up. You'd have discussion posts on Bucks shot at a title and there were always good numbers of people saying with the right amount of luck they could go all the way. Don't really see any of that with the Jazz this year. Only posts talking about Gobert's win shares or debates on if Donovan Mitchell is or isn't an inefficient chucker. Although recently the latter half of that has been mostly shut up with his play.
Donovan Mitchell
"I don't understand why Kyrie and Donovan Mitchell are above Steph and Damian, is record really that much of a factor for the ALL NBA team?"
He shit on Donovan Mitchell during an interview with him for no reason like a month or two ago
"At just about everything. Mitchell is far from a negative defender. He‚Äôs a better facilitator and playmaker. You take away the first month of the season when Donovan was a little off, he‚Äôs averaging more ppg than Zach. And all of that isn‚Äôt even mentioning the fact that the Jazz are the best team in the league and Chicago might maybe squeak into the playoffs."
he reminds me of a bigger Donovan Mitchell
Donovan Mitchell? After he got all butt hurt and was throwing shade about the Rudy Gobert shit? Lol mans a fucking goof
Donovan Mitchell is the walking definition of an overrated player
They actually don't have similar playstyles. Jaylen Brown plays nothing like Donovan Mitchell or Zach Lavine. So on top of not being a SG.. he doesn't belong here lol

"I am, I just don't like people in the media acting like he's the only reason. Where's Monty Williams' flowers? Where's the Devin Booker hype? I've heard more about Donovan Mitchell this whole season than Book and he's another underrated guy."
"Bro I hate people arguing this Gobert over Jokic nonsense when Gobert also has 3 great perimeter defenders in Royce O'Neal, Joe Ingles, and Mike Conley. Also has an insane primary scorer in Donovan Mitchell, the best 3 point shooting team in the league, a player on pace to set the TS% record, a 6MOTY candidate, and is the 4th scorer on his team.   I was hard rooting for the Jazz because I liked their team design and wanted to see the West shaken up, but their Reddit fans are becoming intolerable. Yesterday I'm arguing with someone who thinks Gobert is a top 10 player, now I'm seeing Gobert over Jokic as if he single handedly guarantees a top 3 defense"
"Just wait for the outrage when people realize that 4 of Donovan Mitchell, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Kyrie Irving, Zach LaVine and Bradley Beal wont even make an All NBA team this year. Have no idea which 2 even should of that group"

&gt; worth noting that there are still a number of NBA players that are unsure about getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Donovan Mitchell and James Harden among those who today said they haven‚Äôt decided what they‚Äôll be doing as far as the vaccine is concerned.
"Oh for sure. I don‚Äôt see him being like a Donovan Mitchell type rookie, but more like a super glue guy that just does everything needed for the team. He‚Äôs got so much hustle"
"Tbh that‚Äôs bs. The best young guys in the league all come across as pretty composed, maybe that‚Äôs what‚Äôs affecting guys like Draymond and Shaq, that you can‚Äôt get into these guys heads like for example Donovan Mitchell. To me it sounds like they‚Äôre just more mature than the past players.  Even then if you watch some of the best young guys like Mitchell, Booker, Simmons, Tatum, Brown etc all of them show maturity on the court and even some flare. BS take from Draymond"
"It feels like Chris Paul is playing better than ever this year. His game is aging really well.  Donovan Mitchell at -11 also surprised me, but he wasn't getting the support he needed on offense. The Jazz are missing a second strong scorer on their team, which makes me skeptical that they'll be able to handle the Playoffs this year."
"Nurk was a necessary move. Donovan hurts but we wouldn't have grabbed him and if we did then there's probably no Murray so w/e, Mitchell is better but imo not by much. But OG was the piece we needed for the last 3 or so years."
"Donovan Mitchell has two first names, but he also has two last names."

"Porzingas - August 2, 1995   Jokic - February 19, 1995     Is this list 25 and under? Guys who aren't yet stars, but could be? Simply the highest ceiling you can come up with for a guy?        I mean, you've got Booker, Morant, Lamelo, Ingram, Donovan Mitchell, Bam, Porter Jr and countless others who have high ceilings that should be on this list.      You are better off just coming up with a list of best 25 and under rather than highest ceilings. Highest ceiling is so subjective even scouts have a difficult time projecting it. (How many people outside of Denver felt Jokic's ceiling would be this 4 years ago?) Beyond that, it can become silly. If a 7 foot guy like Porzingas starts shooting 40%, his ceiling is ridiculous, right?   Well, yeah, but he's already taken over 1,350 three pointers and he's a 36% shooter. He'll probably shoot lights out one year by the law of averages, but the odds he'll be a consistent 40% shooter aren't real high."

Gonna give my best guesses here not in any particular order....  Zion  Luka  Tatum  Ja Morant   SGA (Shai Gilgeous-Alexander)  Jaylen Brown   Ben Simmons  Donovan Mitchell  Devin Booker  Brandon Ingram
Marry Donovan Mitchell
"Yeah I‚Äôve been thinking lately about what would‚Äôve happened if they had kept Donovan Mitchell instead of trading him. Would Mitchell play off ball more, would Jokic rim run/pick and pop more. They would still have had Murray too who‚Äôs an insanely good iso player who seems to fit extremely well with Joker. I imagine Jokic would have no problem taking a slight step back and facilitating even more."
I agree with you Donovan should be getting way more credit. I disagree that there are a bunch of players comparable to Booker and Mitchell though.
"boxscore doesn't tell any story about offensive impact. Chris Paul is much better offensive player. Donovan Mitchell isn't near Kawhi Leonard on this side of the ball either despite similar numbers  but yes, Ben is definetly overhated and i have no idea why. It seems like people are just waiting for his bad games/stretch just to shit on him and spam ""Haha playoffs HCO 2nd round cloging paint keke"""
Donovan Mitchell exists though
Jazz won 2 games without Donovan Mitchell with that strategy. Putting Rudy on DFS is because you want him to shoot. He just had an outlier game.   The whole Rudy can't defend the perimeter is just bad narrative being repeated again and again. He has one of the best numbers of anyone that has defended ISOs against guards.
"I hope he becomes a perennial first team all-nba with multiple dpoy, mvp,final mvp years so we confuse donovan mitchell with him"
I think some of the Celtics underperformance has to be placed on Tatum's shoulders. I also think you have to credit Mitchell for some of Utah's success. This is why I think the scoring being for a better team is in Mitchell's favor.  Donovan is the least efficient starter on the Jazz because he is the one asked to take the toughest shots. That's a product of his role with the team and less an indicator of him being a poor shooter.
1.	Westbrook 2.	Ginobli 3.	Joe Ingles 4.	Donovan Mitchell 5.	Curry 6.	Jokic 7.	Barkley 8.	Nash 9.	Gobert 10. Dr. J
Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell.  They're both lightning in a bottle and put on that epic scoring duel in the bubble.   And Mitchell was almost a nugget too since nuggets drafted him originally.
Westbrook and PG don't get enough heat for getting bounced by rookie Donovan Mitchell
He dissappears in the playoffs tho. Got beat by rookie donovan mitchell in the first round
1. Gary Payton  2. Russell Westbrook  3. Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf  4. God Shammgod  5. Magic Johnson  6. Steve Nash  7. Jimmy Butler  8. Donovan Mitchell  9. Delaney Rudd  10. Kareem Abdul Jabbar
"Donovan Mitchell.  More often than not, especially in previous seasons, if he was taking a bunch of shots and getting a bunch of points, it was because we had no better choice. We do better with a balanced offensive attack."
I doubted even mentioning him because he gets a lot of undeserved flack. Pretend I said Donovan Mitchell *ducks*
Also just check the plus-minus and Conley and Gobert are around +10 per game. Donovan Mitchell is +5. Really goes to show how offensive minded most people think about the game.
if the list is based on potential (which it was) LaMelo at 3 wasn‚Äôt even the most egregious listing... how tf was Donovan Mitchell 4th
"Except for the part where I said Ingles is more efficient? I know he shoots 50% from 3 and is insanely efficient. I was just defining better offensive player in a different way than the consensus here.  Clarkson scores 19 ppg as a 6th man, I'm assuming playing staggered minutes with the starters. So he doesn't have Donovan Mitchell as the primary scoring threat on the court as much as Ingles does. Ingles scores 11 ppg on much better efficiency, which I acknowledged. It just depends on how you define ""good offense"", the guy who can get his own bucket when needed or the guy who is insanely efficient on lower volume  But keep telling me how I don't know anything about basketball lol"
He's in the same boat as Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert. They deserve fringe votes for being on a top team and having career years. But they aren't in the top-5 conversation or in contention for actually winning the award.
jimmy buttler and donovan Mitchell
"For LaMelo, I just noticed that he is 5 years younger than Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker.  Holy cow."
Donovan Mitchell is actually older than him
"Look I love seeing Donovan high on lists and whatnot but it should be Luka, Zion, Booker, Tatum, Mitchell, Adebayo, Fox, Simmons, SGA, and I don't know where LaMelo goes but not at 3"
Definitely plays a lot more like Wade than Donovan Mitchell does
&gt;u cant name a single superstar that averaged less than 10 bc a **superstar** or a **star** by definition needs to be able to score at at least an average rate. Scoring is and will always be the most important skill in basketball.   you're all over the place dude. First you say superstar then in this post you say superstar or star.     Why do you have to be a superstar to not be considered a role player? I guess a player like Donovan Mitchell is a role player in your eyes too? He's not a superstar.
"How in the world do these guys get slept on in the draft? Devin booker, Kawhi, Donovan Mitchell, etc."
"Child:  Mom I want Jimmy Butler, Donovan Mitchell, Mo Bamba, and Jeff Teague.  Mom:  We have at home."
Davion Mitchell has dragon blood in him. Not related to Donovan at all.
Jimmy Butler &amp; Donovan Mitchell? no wonder Gonzaga blew
"So we got Jarded Butler and Jimmy Butler, Flo Thamba and Mo Bamba, and Davion Mitchell and Donovan Mitchell.  The simulation getting a bit repetitive and uncreative ngl, what's next ""Bronny James""?"
"Melli: ""Hey, would you like this win?""  Donovan Mitchell: ""No thank you, I gotta get a head start on driving home anyway."""
But it‚Äôs true Gobert will make sure Utah‚Äôs in the playoffs   But if the jazz want to do something in the playoffs they are going to need Donovan Mitchell
Thank you donovan Mitchell for donating bricks to the dallas construction corp. With his contribution the houses for the less fortunate can be built
Donovan Mitchell has been ass
Donovan Mitchell
Well you would have young stars on either side which is a massive thing for the NBA to get.   Lebron has only so many years left Booker and Donovan Mitchell have tons of time.   So the NBA casuals won't be watching those are not the fans the NBA really want anyways as those are not the fans that buy merch   I know for a fact jazz and suns fans are very rabid and would end up buying buying a ton
"you guys dodged chris paul this round, let's see if you dodge donovan mitchell next round.  I think the Lakers will have problems against a high powered 3 point shooting offense that's hard to keep up with."
"People said Donovan Mitchell should've been, so might as well have Booker in there too lol."
You snuck Ben Simmons and Donovan Mitchell on and left Luka and Lillard off lol
"Curry, CP3, Harden, Dame.....then Russ  Even at his peak Russ couldn't get out of the 1st round.  Couldn't even make it to 7 games.  Got outplayed by a rookie Donovan Mitchell in the playoffs, got absolutely crushed by Dame."

Ja Morant and Donovan Mitchell are the two guards that are the most fun to watch in the league.
"Thanks a lot.. Raja Bell was one hell of a defender. Respect to the Jazz, who have such a great system where guys fit in their roles, and are always winning, whether it was the late Jerry Sloan or Quinn Snyder.. After Shaq said something about Mitchell not having enough triple-doubles (or at least compared to guys like Westbrook), he should at least know it's not their system to have one guy dominate the ball, and Donovan plays both positions, but more importantly, everyone touches the ball (to make the defense work, scramble, tire out) so no one guy is going to dominate assist numbers. I'm still upset my Pistons selected Luke Kennard over Donovan :)"
What about Donovan Mitchell though?
It‚Äôs wild how these ‚Äúfans‚Äù will say racist shit to opposing fans and players yet they‚Äôre probably wearing Donovan Mitchell jerseys.
Donovan Mitchell is 100x more exciting than anybody on that squad. Maybe even Jordan Clarkson. Such a weird team lol
"Idk man, majority of Utah are Trump supporters, and majority of Utah are Mormons. You‚Äôll find plenty of racists within those groups. Ofc not everyone is a racist, but it‚Äôs a real problem, and acting like it isn‚Äôt only perpetuates the problem further. Donovan Mitchell even called out the state for teaching racism in schools."
"Do these idiots realize there best players are light skinned Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, and Clarkson ü§¶ü§¶ü§¶"
"Being from Utah, and being a jazz fan is exhausting. I‚Äôm half Puerto Rican half Argentine and my classmates in elementary / middle school would make crossing the border and illegal immigrant jokes all the time. The state is so breathtakingly beautiful but there‚Äôs absolutely no diversity and the Mormon church has a stronghold on the culture and politics. It‚Äôs such a shame because Donovan Mitchell is my favorite nba player ever but I wouldn‚Äôt even be remotely upset if he decides to leave the jazz because of the racist pieces of shits. And anyone saying that there‚Äôs no racism in Utah, or that there‚Äôs racists everywhere so it‚Äôs not a big deal are part of the problem"
"I don't know about teams, but the *player* with the most dunks is Rudy Gobert, and we also have Slam Dunk contest winner Donovan Mitchell on our team, so you should watch the Jazz."
"LeBron is likely done with the Olympics. He‚Äôs done alot more than other players of his caliber.   KD is likely done too. He already has two gold medals, not sure a third one would affect his legacy any.   It‚Äôll probably be younger guys like Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Bam. Which I‚Äôm totally fine with lol"
"Exactly, the team was just good. It's not likely they would be able to get another all-star quality player.  He'd be stuck as a 1st/2nd round player. Donovan Mitchell potentially wouldn't be drafted or as good, because he came in with the intention of being the #1, with Hayward there it's a different story."
Donovan Mitchell would never
The Jazz have 2 players more valuable than Giannis according to RAPTOR and neither of them are Donovan Mitchell lol.    Mike Conley is supposedly better offensively and defensively than Giannis.
"I agree and they're pretty much going to be playing the schedule of the 2 seed after they get done with Phoenix so unless the Clippers get out of this funk or Donovan Mitchell and Rudy gobert are still really really really really pissed about being picked last in the All-Star Game, the Lakers will indeed be back in the finals"
Dame was begging the Blazers front office to get Donovan Mitchell back in 2017.  Imagine if they listened.
Lebron's injury is a fact he missed half the season because of his high ankle sprain. Donovan Mitchell missed game 1 of his series because of the same injury. Lebron is obviously playing through it
"Johnnie Bryant from the New York Knicks  It might be a coincidence that Randle put up an all nba year and RJ jumped in year 2 but it may also have something to do with Bryant; his history speaks for itself. The following players have had their best professional seasons when Johnnie Bryant was on the coaching staff. Gordon Hayward, Rodney Hood, George Hill, Rudy Gobert, Bojan Bogdanovic, Donovan Mitchell(before this year), Julius Randle, RJ Barrett. At some point I think the league takes notice and someone lets him run an entire team."
Lebron isn‚Äôt really a fair comparison. He‚Äôs so global that he‚Äôs transcended sports at this point in America. Everyone knows who lebron is and will go comment on his posts if they see something they don‚Äôt like but Donovan Mitchell isn‚Äôt nearly as famous
"If I was at the grizzlies game and saw Donovan Mitchell drop 47 points you bet your ass i'd have a huge grin on my face and i'd be appauding, even if I was pissed my team lost."
Donovan Mitchell himself said Jazz fans have a racism problem.
Would you take Donovan Mitchell and Jason Tatum over one prime Lebron?
This also happened because the Thunder let Utah switch Melo onto Mitchell and Donovan ate him alive over and over.
"Jared Dudley, Donovan Mitchell, Jimmy Butler, Paul Millsap, Mike Scott when he plays"
Donovan Mitchell in between college and the NBA.
"I'm a generation older than these new players. I've wondered what will happen with the first generation of kids who grew up with social media. It has negatives, of course, but it also has the effect of training kids to be media-ready. I see high-school age family members of mine who have thousands of followers--and they're just regular people. A high school basketball star could easily have 10k people in his followers with the corresponding direct feedback in likes, comments, dms, etc.  It sounds dumb--but I think that affects kids. A high school star of today is interacting directly with way more fans, media members, and haters than ever before.  I see it in guys like D'aaron Fox and Donovan Mitchell who you could put in front of a camera today hosting a sports show and they'd slip right in. I also see it in guys like Trae who can not only brush off the haters but actually lean into it a little."
Trae‚Äôs got ice in his veins. He lives for the boos. Luka and Jokic are both tough as hell and fearless. Ja went toe to toe with Steph Curry and Donovan Mitchell and more then held his own. The future of the NBA is here and it‚Äôs going to be so fun to watch as a fan.
"He literally gave Donovan Mitchell covid and started the jazz outbreak which shut down the season, so yes I do believe his stupidity was the reason the league shit down when it did. I also am right when I say that most people still believe he's the reason the league shut down too   https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/07/29/rudy-gobert-coronavirus-nba-return/  https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2020/03/11/coronavirus-nba-shuts-down-after-rudy-gobert-tests-positive/5028026002/"
"Russ is one of my favorite guards all time. Consistently a top 10-15 player in the league throughout his career. This season though, putting him right at 25 is generous. Here‚Äôs the 24 players I have before him, and I can‚Äôt see there being an argument he outplayed any of them this year:  Joker embiid curry Durant  harden Giannis Chris Paul Devin Booker Ja morant  Kyrie Irving  Dame Ben Simmons  Rudy gobert Donovan Mitchell  Trey Young  Luka Kawhi  LeBron Anthony Davis Jayson Tatum Sabonis  Bradley Beal PG-13 Khris Middleton   That would put him at 25. I think a case could be made that Jimmy Butler or Bam would be more deserving of this spot. Also you‚Äôd have to put Jaylen Brown and Jamal Murray higher if they weren‚Äôt injured."
"Ja has played like a star over his past 3-4 games. All being playoff/playin games and he‚Äôs delivering night in and night out.  You sound like the same people who doubted Luka last year, he‚Äôs not a superstar but he has warranted all the praise he‚Äôs getting with his play.  Same way people fawned over Donovan Mitchell, Jamal Murray, And Luka Doncic last playoffs. Let Ja have his moment."

"Tatum, Booker, Trae Young, Ben Simmons,  Donovan Mitchell, Bam, Ayton, and LaMelo could be added as well just to name a few. It's insane how good the young players are."
I would add Donovan Mitchell to that list.
"With his defensive performance against Curry, I'm surprised he couldn't contain a hobbled Donovan Mitchell. Credit to Mitchell for a great game after missing game one tho."
Donovan Mitchell acts pretty big when literally no one is allowed to move within 3 feet of him without drawing a foul
Reminder that Donovan Mitchell is a superstar
"Donovan Mitchell, 5 pounds lighter after returning from the bathroom, is putting the exclamation mark on the Jazz‚Äôs offensive clinic."
DONOVAN MITCHELL CAN HAVE MY FIRST BORN SON
Donovan Mitchell showing his experience already. What a stud
I think Quin Snyder and Donovan Mitchell must bond over being psychopaths. Even though they are not the same kind.
I only recently found out Donovan Mitchell is only 6'1. Seems so much bigger. Think it's partly his play style and partly his build.
I missed watching Donovan Mitchell so much
Donovan Mitchell was made for the playoffs
donovan mitchell back is gonna kill grizz. they really gained some respect i hope they can push for one more win before the series is over
Donovan Mitchell is like Diet D Wade with a three
Is Donovan Mitchell playing? They haven't mentioned him yet
How could anyone not love Donovan Mitchell?
I can‚Äôt tell if this is Michael Jordan or Donovan Mitchell with all these calls
Donovan Mitchell is hard to root against
Does anyone else have the dilemma where they really like Donovan Mitchell but hate the Jazz?
[Donovan Mitchell talks about how good he is](https://www.si.com/nba/clippers/news/donovan-mitchell-calls-patrick-beverley-first-team-all-defense)
"That‚Äôs a good point, he‚Äôs definitely a monster and in the consideration. I value people heavily on overall positive impact on the game and *consistency* more than individual stat lines, which leads me to value Russ less. PG too, and my favorite player Donovan Mitchell as well, if I‚Äôm being honest.   However, everyone doesn‚Äôt feel the same and he definitely puts up some absurd numbers."
"I'd probably say 2019 right before the playoffs started. We barely snuck in the Playoffs after I felt we would have a much better year. Everyone and their brother new we would get annihilated by the Bucks.      Tired of years of Drummond not playing up to his potential, watching Blake absolutely carry the team and break down physically in the process, not seeing much improvement from Kennard in his second year who was supposed to be our promising young guy while simultaneously seeing the guy we should have drafted (Donovan Mitchell) putting up 24 PPG and leading his team to 50-32. Watching Stanley Johnson continue to suck and not improve on offense.       It really felt like we had a meh roster with no future that would continually be the 8-11 seed forever.      This year, despite being the least number of wins we've had since 1980 was the most hope I've had in a long time. We have a bunch of exciting young guys, an MIP candidate just going into his prime, 11 guys 23 and under, an exciting new GM that has made a ton of good moves and seems to have righted the ship and a shot at a top pick this year."
The Lakers would be the fourth seed in the east even if you don't assume they'd win more games during the season playing out east.  I bet Utah and Phoenix would love to play Washington and Boston though. Donovan Mitchell could take the whole series off
Are Trae/Donovan/Collins even that close? Isn't Mitchell like super close with Brown?
"Yeah, and I also think that the 2 other factors are if murray was healthy Denver would be a legitimate contender to me, and also I don‚Äôt want to overreact to the jazz losing one game without Donovan Mitchell.  I actually think the jazz are pretty comparable to the sixers - both 1 seeds who have really proven nothing in the playoffs past, and both don‚Äôt have teams built for deep playoff success imo"
"The Grizzlies beating the Jazz would be one of the biggest upsets ever. Even without Donovan Mitchell, they are a heavy favorite."
Donovan Mitchell is missing playoff games with the same injury.
Honestly I‚Äôm having a hard time forgiving Shaq for being shady/weird to Donovan Mitchell.
"Fine, can be argued but I don't consider to be a toss-up, like say Donovan Mitchell."
Booker is the player Donovan Mitchell thinks he is
"Just doing the playoffs teams, some players are pretty random:  Jazz: Donovan Mitchell  Memphis: Marc Gasol/Conley  Clippers: Griffin  Mavs: Dirk  Denver: Murray  Portland: Lillard  Phoenix: Nash  Lakers: Kobe  Philly: MCW  Washington: Wall  Knicks: Me7oooo  Atlanta: Alex Len  Bucks: Giannis  Miami: LeBron  Nets: Brook Lopez or Deron Williams  Celtics: Kevin Garnett"
"Trying it right now, right off the top of the head  Dallas: Luka; Denver: Jokic: Houston: Harden: Clippers: Blake Griffin; Lakers: LeBron; Memphis: Ja Morant; Minnesota: KAT; New Orleans: Anthony Davis; OKC: Kevin Durant; Phoenix: Devin Booker; Portland; CJ McCollum; Sacramento: DeMarcus Cousins; Spurs: Tim Duncan; Utah: Donovan Mitchell  Atlanta: Trae Young; Boston: Jayson Tatum; Brooklyn: Kyrie Irving; Charlotte: Gordon Hayward; Chicago: Derrick Rose; Cleveland: LeBron James; Detroit: Ben Gordon; Indiana: CJ Miles; Miami: LeBron James; Milwaukee: Giannis Antetokounmpo; New York: Carmelo Anthiny; Orlando: Mo Bamba; Philadelphia: Ben Simmons; Toronto: Kyle Lowry: Washington: John Wall"
If we kept that 2018 team + made the correct draft choices:  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander - Donovan Mitchell - Devin Booker - Tobias Harris - Andre Drummond
"Then someone in the board room, who is a big NBA fan, receives an alert on their phone about a Shams tweet. And he's like ""Oh, Donovan Mitchell isn't playing tonight, according to Shams.""  And then Jeff Goldblum, who was brought on as a board member because everyone just likes hearing him talk, was like ""hold on a second uh uh... Shams, Shams... Shamwow... Shamwow towels absorb water... Water... Is something that thirsty people drink... You get thirsty playing sports... If you play sports, you're an athlete... Athletic... I've got it! We should buy the Athletic!""  Then a board member scoffed. ""Athletic? They do not have a profitable business model.""  And another guys like ""Yes, but guess who subscribes to The Athletic.""  Then, all at once the entire board said ""nuttysandwiches!"""
Bradley Beal? Donovan Mitchell?
"Donovan Mitchell for Julio Jones, win-win."
"Other conspiracy theory Donovan Mitchell was starting get ""Donovan Mitchell out of Utah"" narrative"
"Being basically 0 in on/off while playing for the best team in points differential while comming of the bench is huge though.  And +/- is a very flawed statistic if seen in a vacum, it's dependant on rotations. CP3 is much lower than Thad Young, did he have a worse impact? Middleton, DeRozan, Fox, Vucevic, Donovan Mitchell, etc all had negative on/off, are they worse than him?"
"They did, just Harkless and Aminu were backup caliber forwards playing 30 minutes a game.  Portland just didn't have the supporting shooting or playmaking in 2018.  He followed that really poor performance up with a run to the WCF despite having a frontcourt of injured and fasting Kanter + Harkless and Aminu.    He's a solid coach.  Not elite, but unless Spo is willing to return to Portland I'm not sure if Portland can lure anyone better.    The issue, more than anything, is Olshey's roster construction and drafting.  We have 2 forwards and one of them is Melo.  We absolutely blew the 2017 draft where we had 3 first rounders and walked away with Zach Collins and Swanigan.  Hindsight is 2020, but there is a world where Portland could have had Donovan Mitchell and Kuzma from that draft, or if we didn't trade up John Collins, OG Anunoby/Jerrett Allen, and Kuzma/White/Hart.  I'm not even convinced we needed to trade up for Zach Collins.  That offseason where we dumped money on Meyers Leonard and Evan Turner was also a disaster."
forgot to add laughed when donovan mitchell got hit in the nuts with the basketball
"That stage was already set when both AD and Lebron missed more than a dozen games during the season with injuries that only get better with months of rest. These theatrics aren't necessary. Both of them are hurt, but like many players at this point, they will keep playing hurt. Sometimes thats how it is. People still shit on Lilliard for playing poorly in that series where he had broken ribs. Donovan Mitchell would have played injured the other day if he could."
I think Donovan Mitchell will have a very Damian Lillard esque career in the NBA
Wow surprised he won it over Donovan Mitchell
Probably gonna be different when Donovan Mitchell can guard him in game 2.
donovan mitchell plays basketball? i thought he was just some trinket used for bragging.
"So weird not seeing James Harden, Jayson Tatum, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell on the list. And yet, I don't see anything wrong with these choices (other than Jimmy Butler).     This league is way too talented."
"&gt;	Pretty ridiculous omissions especially Donovan Mitchell.   All-NBA is based on the entire regular season, not the most recent two weeks of playoff basketball.  Also, who are you removing for these *ten* players? That‚Äôs two entire teams."
Like don't get me wrong tell George had a good year but this is a guy that's known to wet the bed constantly. Why not throw somebody else on there like Donovan Mitchell or Devin Booker. This is garbage.
"Okay great, so you're mostly right. Before I explain where I think you're wrong let me explain how basketball changes in the playoffs compared to the regular season.   Playoff basketball is a game of give and take, you take what the defense gives you, they adjust, you find the new weakness, rinse and repeat.   You are right about shot deterrence/rim protection (I qualify these as the same strength). Utah's defense is excellent because they have good all around perimeter defenders with Gobert spearheading the paint.   There are two ways you can attack Utah's drop defense:  1) Single out Gobert in isolation with an elite guard. You touched on this with one of his weaknesses being poor footspeed on the perimeter  2) Midrange jumpers to open up the offense. Good midrange shot creators (e.g., Kawhi) can get their shot when they want against Utah's defense because they strategically concede them.   This works well in the regular season when teams are just running default schemes and not practicing midrange jumpers to prepare for Utah. In the postseason however, teams adjust and that's why at least over the last couple years you see that Utah's defense, while consistently top 5 in the regular season, routinely gets worse in the playoffs. Part of this is because they're playing better teams but that just adds to my point, better teams can exploit Utah's weaknesses  Another point to consider is that players naturally adjust to each other over the course of a series. A couple years back Harden would struggle to get the same calls he got in the regular season the longer a series went on, because teams would adjust to his alien-like movements that he'd use to draw fouls and stop making the same mistakes.   Similarly, teams get used to Gobert's commanding presence in the paint. Unlike players like Draymond or Giannis however, Gobert isn't versatile enough as a defender to be able to adjust back. It's not his fault, he has slow lateral movement and reflexes.   Now for offense. Gobert's finishing is one of my biggest gripes in his game. He can ""finish"" well when he finds the open lane, which to his credit he can do with consistency (although those lanes get closed in the playoffs). But if you give Gobert the ball in the low block with a mismatch like a PG or someone, he doesn't have a soft touch to lay the ball up and in.   His hands are also bad (they used to be awful, so he's improved a bit). This is partially why as you mentioned he's a bad decision maker with the ball in his hands. Things move so quickly in the NBA and the half second of awareness Gobert loses because he has to focus on catching the ball, ends up costing him opportunities for assists.    Now for Mitchell:   Mitchell is one of the best players I've ever seen at splitting the double team. In the playoffs this is especially valuable because he's leaving two players behind and getting to play 4v3 on offense. This leads to dumps to Gobert, or quality layups most of the time.   If you don't double him then he can either create a shot on the perimeter or beat his man off the dribble for a midrange pull up or layup. I'd combine undisciplined shot selection, tunnel vision and middling court vision into 1 weakness, that being tunnel vision. When Donovan tunnels he very often misses his teammates for wide open shots. He also gambles a lot on defense, for the most part he can get away with it because Utah is so elite at recovering but it does lead to open shots for the opposing team so I'll give you that.  Why I think Donovan is better. Less of his game is compromised by playoff basketball, while Rudy has a hard time adjusting to changing gameplans, Donovan's game is built for adjustment. If you try to take away his first option to score by doubling, he'll split the double and create a second option for himself.   Rudy's value on the other hand, is primarily defensive. If you're immobile then you can't adjust as easily, which can allow opposing teams to exploit him.     My biggest reason for picking Donovan though is that he never quits on the team. If Rudy doesn't get the ball for many possessions in a row, he disengages and has atrocious body language. Just yesterday when the Jazz were fighting to make a comeback, Rudy wasn't positioning himself well for rebounds, wasn't being active on offense, and was making poor decisions.   I ended up writing way more than I expected so   TL;DR Rudy exploitable, disengages when things aren't going his way, has a harder time adjusting in the playoffs. Also Offense &gt; Defense in general but especially in the playoffs."
"&gt; Donovan Mitchell (literally averaged 26 and led the 1 seed)  When you put it like that, holy hell it sounds even worse"
Donovan Mitchell and Luka Doncic: First time?
Realistically what happened is people look at Paul as a winner and Booker as a loser so they incorrectly parsed out who gets credit based on this.  Still not sure he deserves all NBA. There were so many good guards. Donovan Mitchell was left off too and Beal did lose a lot of games like Booker has in the past but Beal had a better season this year than any of bookers in the past.
"Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker have been robbed in my estimation.  And perhaps Westbrook and Trae.   Who do I take off?   Well, Butler for sure. He's got there on name only. He had a subpar season for sure.   No doubt in my mind that Booker and Mitchell played better than him this year.   Bradley Beal too. I mean, if Westy ain't going to make it, how is the second best player on his team going to make it? And over two guys who play the same position and led their teams to the top of the west?   But damn... it's hard to fit Westy and Trae on there."
I would take Donovan Mitchell over all 5 guys in the third team.
Donovan Mitchell? How is the best player on the best team in the NBA(as far as record goes) not make at least one All-NBA team?
"Which is the point right?  Devin Booker last year 27/4/7 on 62% TS, missed the play-in by half a game, and received 3 All-NBA third-team votes.  Russ was the 3rd team guard also finishing ahead of him was Beal, Lowry, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, and Kemba Walker. Booker finished 12th in guard voting.  There is definite rewarding of winning for certain guys on that list but not others."
"Guard spot is tight.  Like damn, Book has to compete with Steph, Dame, Luka, Kyrie, Beal, and CP3 and that's just those who made their team.  Then theres Donovan Mitchell."
"&gt; Booker has a way better team than Beal, and the Wizards almost made the playoffs with an awful team, oh yeah, and he also has better numbers  Does this sound familiar to anyone?  Devin Booker last year 27/4/7 on 62% TS, missed the play-in by half a game, and received 3 All-NBA third-team votes.   Russ was the 3rd team guard also finishing ahead of him was Beal, Lowry, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, and Kemba Walker. Booker finished 12th in guard voting.  This year he finished 10th.  Just seems like goal posts shifting to me."
Why did Chris Paul make it? Is it cause suns record improved over a year? Donovan Mitchell had better stats and a better record.
"Notable guys on Winning Teams that didn‚Äôt make the cut:  James Harden (lol)  Donovan Mitchell (literally averaged 26 and led the 1 seed)  Devin Booker  Jayson Tatum  Russell Westbrook  Trae Young  Anthony Davis  Ben Simmons/Tobias Harris (can these guys be combined into one elite first team player instead)  Jaylen Brown   Pretty ridiculous omissions especially Donovan Mitchell. James Harden would‚Äôve definitely made it on if he didn‚Äôt get injured, maybe he‚Äôd have replaced Beal"
Don as in Donovan Mitchell? Lmao
"All-NBA 4th team:  Donovan Mitchell  Devin Booker  Jayson Tatum  Zion Williamson  Kevin Durant  I guess Russ on the 5th team? Damn, so many good guards"
"Tatum got absolutely robbed, and I feel like Donovan Mitchell has a very good case for feeling like it too.  Also Dame not making 1st team was very unexpected. Did Luka's eligibility for both guard and forward spot benefit him, since Curry and Dame were both only eligible as guards?  Also feel like PG had a 2nd team worthy year."
This is my second comment bitching that Donovan Mitchell didn‚Äôt make it. I‚Äôm so shocked I had to make another comment
One of booker and Donovan Mitchell should‚Äôve at least made a team
"Has anyone other than Curry made All-NBA for NOT making the playoffs, this year? Has anyone other than Donovan Mitchell been punished, for leading his team to the NBA's best record this season?"
No Donovan Mitchell?
"Kenny the Coward will say Donovan Mitchell should have been named, but won't say over who."
No Donovan Mitchell? This is a joke. Utah has the best record in the league because of him.
Donovan Mitchell?
Yup. This was in 2019 and I can‚Äôt even say who the best player was: Donovan Mitchell? Jayson Tatum? Khris Middleton?
"Yes. At some point in time, a player must develop. You mentioned Donovan Mitchell. He was the #13 pick in his draft class. If he never improves from this year, you take a #13 overall pick leading you at least once to the #1 seed in the West and taking you to at least the second round of the playoffs as your best player. For the #1 overall pick? No.   What's alarming about Ben is his lack of progress. This is his fourth year playing (fifth year overall.) Played 58 regular season games and now nine playoff games. Has made THREE 3-ptrs all year. For reference, Dwight Howard has made more this season. Simmons ceiling, as of right now, is being the #3 option on a conference finals contender or a #4 option on a legit threat to win it all. That's not what you draft players #1 overall for."
"2010's: LeBron, Curry, KD, Harden, Kawhi    2020's: Tatum, Booker, Trae, Luka, Donovan Mitchell."
"Goberts ft percentage is much higher than Simmons, and he is often under utilized on offense. I don't think anyone would call him a liability on offense. Also it used to be fairly accepted that Ben Simmons was better than Donovan Mitchell, but I do think the edge may go to Donovan with his playoff performance every year."
"people have this expectation of him that is higher than the reality of his value currently. Hes a very good player, not a superstar, not a top 15 guy and thats fine. Hes still very good and young so time is on his side. And sure donovan Mitchell is better than him, that says more about Mitchell than a slight to ben"
"Yeah these comments are just straight up dumb. You and OP are completely right. Donovan takes ill advised shots that should be passed up for a better percentage shots. It worked in game 1 and 2 bc he was on fire, but when he‚Äôs not making them, he shouldn‚Äôt continue to force those isos. Mitchell is the worst offender of this hero type basketball bc he almost has the physical abilities to do it, but he lacks the IQ to do it effectively, basically knowing when to pass when the shot isn‚Äôt there. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll learn as he plays more playoff games but right now, he‚Äôs taking too many layups that are impossible to make."
Eagle is also the most prepared and best informed.  Man spends hours every game day preparing for that night and Doris Burke can't even bother to learn that it's DONOVAN not DUNUVAN Mitchell.
"Mavs fan. Right now, Bucks or Utah. But I don't really see them winning against a hungry, surging Suns team unless the Bucks learn to play more than one style of basketball (i.e. give Giannis the ball); unless Utah gets Donovan Mitchell to 100%."
&gt; Idk like Ben definitely isn‚Äôt a bust but if people knew that THIS was the Ben Simmons we would end up with them that ROY would‚Äôve went to Donovan Mitchell  What the actual fuck. You think rookie of the year goes to the player projected to have the best career?
&gt; Idk like Ben definitely isn‚Äôt a bust but if people knew that THIS was the Ben Simmons we would end up with them that ROY would‚Äôve went to Donovan Mitchell  Your take on this might be a tad colored by recency bias with Mitchell being in the playoffs right now.  Tatum had the better rookie year between him and Mitchell.
I'm just here to say no matter what Donovan Mitchell was robbed of that ROY  Even if Simmons was tearing through the league right now
"Donovan Mitchell is one of the most receptive players I've ever seen. He's constantly asking people for advice‚Äîhis coach, other players, even former players. Whether he's executing well on the way he's playing is one thing, but I truly do not believe that he's choosing to play in this way without being asked to by Coach Quin."
This bonafide scrub also called Donovan Mitchell the best player in Jazz history.
While I certainly would not be upset if the Jazz wins the series. Donovan Mitchell is my current favorite player. I think Clippers are taking it. I'd like to see PG win a ring.
"Why is booker being compared to tatum? They‚Äôre not even on the same level. Should be comparing booker to a guy like Donovan Mitchell. All the suns fans in here saying booker is better than Tatum, would trade booker for Tatum everyday of the week."
Donovan mitchell
"Poor Donovan Mitchell, he deserves better"
"You could see how much the Jazz were missing Conley.  Donovan Mitchell has had an incredible series, but he's a little banged up at the moment and needs a creative player next to him so he isn't having to generate such a massive chunk of the offensive.  Gobert really forced the Clippers to adjust their plan of attack.  So far they've done well to create good jump shooting opportunities while cutting down the -often futile- drives to challenge Gobert at the rim.  It's a testament to his skill level that he remains a very positive contributor even while the Clippers have made a concerted effort to try and take him out of the game with small ball heavy rotations.  The Clippers, for their part, are going to live or die based on the shooting of Marcus Morris and whichever role players Ty chooses to feature in the remaining games.  PG will always be streaky on offense, but he's looking as comfortable as we've seen him in a Clippers uniform."

I remember when people thought Hayward wasn't going to get paid after he shot 30% from 3 and and was just down overall down in shooting his 4th year. Jazz were greedy and didn't max him right away. Charlotte Maxed him with a player option that the Jazz were forced to sign and he opted out and got to leave there early. Jazz got lightning in a bottle with Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell shortly after that though but at the time it was a dark time for them.
Momentum shift..  &gt;  Jazz been disappointing all of a sudden. It's just Donovan Mitchell out there.. and he's the 4th year player.  Where's the vets and experienced players?  Don't they have any or what
"2 things happened here.  1- Kawhi did not do a stare down, he wasn't looking at Favors.  2 - Donovan Mitchell looked like he saw the ghost of Favors leaving its host body."
Yeah I'm sure when Joe Ingles tried to clip his knee and then shoved him afterwards that was totally on Kawhi     Wonder what the reaction would be if Pat Bev tried that with Donovan Mitchell?
"Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha so now we are acting like Tatum did that all alone, damn more evidence of leeway large market stars are given.    By those metrics Jayson Tatum can‚Äôt be as good as Donovan Mitchell Bc he isn‚Äôt in the playoffs, meanwhile Donovan is averaging 37 ppg being guarded by PG and Kawhi. Do you see how stupid your argument sounds when you reduce players to one selective series or time frame rather than looking at their entire careers and body of work? Get the fuck out of your head and appreciate that both players are incredible young players we get to watch for years to come."
"Don't shit on Favors here. His man is in the corner, he comes all the way across the paint to contest without fouling. It's a good contest; Kawhi makes a good finish. Donovan Mitchell is guarding the other corner man and doesn't come over at all to help on the driver. He had less ground to cover than Favors but is just chilling. If you want to shit on someone shit on him.   Or Royce O'Neil for giving up a damn straight-line drive in the first place.  Favors is the best defender in this clip."
"Donovan ""Despite the Loss"" Mitchell"
"what is the point of posting offensive box score stats for a player whos entire impact is defense lolz  ""In a pivotal game 3 for the jazz donovan mitchell only posted 0 blocks and 2 steals. Is he overrated?"""
"He deserved that though. Think about it. Paul George got outplayed by rookie Donovan Mitchell in 2018 playoffs, 1st round exit in 2019, last year with all the battle for LA shit, they flamed out while up 3-1 in the second round. Paul‚Äôs playoff performance in 2018 and 2020 were atrocious, especially in the most important games.   In the last elimination game in 2018, he shot 2-16 and scored 5 points. So after all that, this year they went down 0-2 to the Mavericks who have no other star player other than doncic. It was embarrassing af  Good for them that they came back, but don‚Äôt pretend like the last few years of PGs career didn‚Äôt happen"
"Bucci just said, ""Mitchell did not play well, 9/26."" without mentioning the man had 37 points. Just another day at the office for Donovan Mitchell."
"I think a lot of people calling for the Jazz to sub out Mitchell early forgot two very important things  1. Our ability to choke/Clippers Curse 2. Donovan Mitchell is a grown ass man  I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a bit anxious in the 4th watching us brick 3s and Donovan was heating up, buying his team enough time to try and help him out. After that Jazz/Nuggets series, I'll never doubt Donovan to get his and then some.  Always, bless the knees, be healthy, Kawhi."
Donovan Mitchell is fucking built different. Love him.
"Frustration from Mitchell, some gamesmanship from Bev. He knows if that becomes a double tech Clippers benefit a lot more from Donovan picking one up that they lose from him getting one."
The Jazz don't have anyone that can do anything besides Donovan Mitchell.  The Clippers have realized this and have adjusted their defense accordingly.
It's Donovan Mitchell vs. the world out here
"Donovan Mitchell has 1 healthy ankle, btw"
"Ya....if you follow the nba, it‚Äôs kinda easy.  Like today, Donovan Mitchell started off extremely slowly....so is point total dropped to 25....I hammered that shit right away, and now he‚Äôs 2 points away with an entire half left.  The only thing that sucks are blowouts....players usually don‚Äôt play as many minutes in those."
Clamping Donovan Mitchell
donovan mitchell consistently plays like a superstar for them
"No matter the outcome of this series, Donovan Mitchell has definitely reached another level"
Donovan Mitchell with that Manchurian candidate look
Donovan Mitchell -21
Donovan mitchell
"Luka is far from a traffic cone these days, anyone who still believes this needs to watch him closely. Mitchell isn't a whole lot better even on his best days.   Even if he were a significantly worse defender he's still contributing more points to his team by drawing double-teams and making teams change their entire defensive schemes. I don't see Donovan Mitchell consistently being 50%+ of his team's offense."
Lol you should be in a good mood today based on your flair. What did Donovan Mitchell do to you?
Remember when people said the jazz had the better 3-7 players? Looking more like they only donovan mitchell even in top 10 this series
Donovan Mitchell can't become Michael Jordan for every game.
"Idk, I'd say that this game isn't over and the Jazz can go on a run and come back, but lets be real that's not happening without a healthy Donovan Mitchell."
Hey guys don‚Äôt worry people keep telling me Donovan Mitchell is like a young Dwayne wade ü§°
"If Donovan Mitchell keeps hobbling like this, this series is over. Without him they wouldn't even have gotten past the Grizzlies."
Jazz not doing so well after Stephen A. Smith anointed Donovan Mitchell the greatest player in Utah Jazz franchise history.
"I fucking love Embiid but you‚Äôre right, Giannis has this type of game and people start questioning his top 10 status, hell a week ago people were putting fucking Donovan Mitchell over him"
"Donovan Mitchell looks much taller than 6'1"""
"Durant doesn't need this series. We already know he's the second best player of the past decade, first-ballot Hall of Famer, and a lock for top 50 all time. I know it's trendy to hate on him, but he's not Donovan Mitchell or Luka Doncic - he doesn't need to prove anything anymore."
what do you think the odds of donovan mitchell getting 8 assists next game are
I don‚Äôt know how many more Donovan Mitchell Spider-Man puns I can take
Feel like the clippers are going to win and pretty much have consistently outplayed the Jazz ever since they went small and Batum at the 5. Donovan Mitchell has been going mental though so idk. His shot is so wet rn lol
Damn I‚Äôm excited for the Jazz-Clippers game tonight. I‚Äôve been waiting for a Donovan Mitchell 50 point game. Let‚Äôs go Jazz üé∂üé∂üé∂
Lol who tf voted Donovan Mitchell for all defense. He might give less effort than anyone else in the league on defense in the regular season. Which is fine because we have Rudy to cover for him but that‚Äôs just silly.
"If there‚Äôs no AD and no Donovan Mitchell and no Jamal Murray and no Harden and no Kyrie blah blah blah injuries happen, taking risks on great players who get injured is part of the game. The hypotheticals and the imaginary alternate universe of what team should have won doesn‚Äôt exist"
Call out Donovan Mitchell too while you‚Äôre at it.
"Mitchell is hurt and averaging 37ppg for the series so far? I don't think the Clippers ""discovered"" anything about Mitchell being hurt, but they do know they can beat the Jazz even with Donovan going off unless the rest of the team steps up. And that's a lot harder with no Conley."
"I agree. Mitchell is hurt and Clippers are figuring us out. We need Conley to do his thing (also dude shot over 50% from 3 in the Grizzlies series). If we don't get him back I think we crash and burn, especially since Donovan seems to be getting more and more hurt every game."
He's not better than Donovan Mitchell
I have a weird feeling that Donovan Mitchell is out too
Or Donovan Mitchell or Chris Paul
"I'm gonna take it a step further and say that even with your 2-1 lead, you're not going to win this series without Conley coming back.  Your team literally looked like the Utah Mavericks in the last game. You had a Luka in Donovan Mitchell, a THJ in Ingles, and I respect Gobert a lot but he wasn't good in the last game. Probably the worst game I've seen from him in a while."
I like the jazz too. wish there wasn't so much animosity surrounding stupid awards. Donovan Mitchell is a beast.
KAT played better against the Rockets that year than Donovan Mitchell did either year also. It was a hard first round opponent.
Hates Jaylen? I think he's in a pretty good tier. He's in the same tier as Paul George and Ben Simmons which seems more than fair IMO. Jaylen is great but you think he's on the same tier as Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker? I don't think he's quite there.
"it doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with the Clippers necessarily, it was just an example. Same goes for the Jazz too. Example being Donovan Mitchell, and his ankle. He will only have 1 day off if Jazz go through after an extremely competitive setting that challenges his ankle and then will start a whole another journey. That is extremely risky for the player. NBA cares more about the viewers than the players though."
"Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley you mean"
"I think a Sixers / Jazz finals would be the best fun for nearly everyone from a fan's standpoint.  ROY runner up Donovan Mitchell can do his best to try and score on DPOY runner up ROY winner Ben Simmons, while also DPOY Rudy Gobert can get his shot to slow down MVP runner up Joel Embiid.     Plenty of fun storylines all around."
"If the Jazz make the wcf, it would be such a good matchup.  Donovan Mitchell vs Devin Booker Gobert vs Ayton Conley vs Paul  Then a crapton of young talent to follow that. What a good series it would be"
"This post is pretty dumb and he is not getting traded, but for the sake of arguing, let me see if I can take a stab at naming some players that may be similarly valued...don't bite my head off if you disagree.  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Bam Adebayo  Donovan Mitchell (maybe a little more valuable)  Christian Wood  Zach LaVine"
"Bro, same here. Organizationally, literally from the owner down, it‚Äôs an entirely different team. No reason to hate them because they kicked our asses back in the 90s. Lol.  Donovan Mitchell is one of my top five favorite players, and currently none of my top five favorite players are even on the Rockets. Lol.  Plus, I‚Äôm pretty sure most of the fans acting like they ‚Äústill hate the Jazz‚Äù were probably two or three years old when the rivalry was big."
"It's like people don't understand the concept of averages. The bubble made it so much worse. Basically your bubble high was treated as your average. National TV analysts calling Donovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray ""MVP candidates next season."" Because they had crazy high scoring bubble playoff games against each other. Jokic has a great playoff run and all of a sudden that's just who he is. 35/15/15 guy.   I'm a Sixers fan. I know Embiid can drop 40. I also know the difference between being able to drop 40 and being a 24-27 ppg guy, which is what he is."
"You're starting to see it, but there are still issues.  1.  He did glamorize tanking.  ""Trust the Process' is literally a masterclass in rebranding basically austerity as something positive.  There was no cutesy marketing phrase for Donald Sterling's cheapest possible teams he'd regularly throw out just to take advantage of locked in rookie contracts and revenue sharing.  Trust the Process is the basketball equivalent of The Patriot Act as far as PR spin.      2.  There is no inequity in the league.  There are well run organizations (Miami), lucky organizations (Cleveland), and poorly run organizations (philly, ny, chicago, sacramento, minnesota, cleveland).  ""Big market"" NY, Chicago, Philly, Brooklyn, LAC, Houston, Phoenix, and Atlanta, combined have fewer finals appearances (0) in the last 20 years than miniscule market Oklahoma City (1) or Orlando (1) and have way fewer finals appearances than either medium-market-at-best Miami (6) or San Antonio (5).  You can make an argument the CA teams, especially the Lakers, are in a different tier, but even there, the Lakers are coming off a 6 year playoff drought and until recently, GSW were a perennial afterthought, and the Clips were arguably the worst organization in north american sports.      3.  Teams that can't get good players to sign are almost always complete garbage organizations in how they run things.  Either the owners are cheap as hell or the front office is incompetent, so naturally they blame the ""Big Market"" draw.  Teams that do wind up signing big free agents almost invariably have a winning culture and solid management.   4.  Drafting a star outside the top 5 is damn near the norm:  giannis, steph, kawhi, harden, jokic, butler, murray, bam, klay, draymond, Lillard, donovan mitchell, siakam, paul george, and even rising stars like booker or lavine and I'm probably missing a couple.  The best teams are always a combination of good drafting, good development, and good front office management, not blind lottery luck, like say minnesota.    5.  Exploiting a loophole when it's that harmful to the overall product is a problem.  Moneyball worked because they figured out a way to WIN without stars.  Not only did they raise the value of the team, but they raised the level of interest in the league.  Trust the Process straight up cost everybody in the NBA money, from the owners to the players, because nobody wanted to watch the Hinkie sixers except like 50 diehard sixers fans that drank the koolaid.   I watched parts of a few games against good teams and invariably when they lost, but kept it close, you'd see those diehard sixers fans super excited about their g-league squad.  Only it was in the same way as someone watching their 8 year old barely losing to their disinterested teenager - fascinating for them, boring as fuck for everybody else.    6.  I would 1 billion percent not accept 5 years of tanking for a championship anymore than I would willingly watch 5 years of bad movies for a possible chance of 1 good year of movies.  Basketball is entertainment, there's no tangible value to a championship, five years of deliberate boredom do not justify one year of possible excitement because that's 5 goddamn years of boredom.  Imagine purposely boring yourself for five years like you have an infinite number of years to live.      7.  Yeah, you're starting to see.  Walmart is predatory and awful.  It shuts down small businesses because it's big enough to sell at minimal margins or losses that competitors simply can't survive.  The end result is the only store left is Walmart.  It's great for walmart because now they can charge whatever for anything and it's awful for literally everybody else including the customers who now have no options and no buyer power and competitors who have to shutter their businesses and hope for the best in a saturated employment market.  It's an awful and flawed model, but perfectly legal.  If only there was an Adam Silver to say, no, Walmart, you can't exploit that loophole, even though it is legal, precisely because it is obviously to everybody else's detriment.  Hinkie was Walmart."
Giannis most likely. Embiid if Philly keeps falling short.  Probably too early to call but I can see Booker or Donovan Mitchell wanting out at some stage.
"In the season opener they actually put PJ on Dame Lillard for a couple of key poss at the end of the 4th and OT. Last poss [of that game he looks pretty good on here doing it](https://go.nba.com/hl3q).   Hou has asked him to play as a big the last 2 years but in 2019 googling his matchup tab here are the guys he spent the most time guarding: Paul George, LeBron, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard. If you go down youll see him having games of guarding 2's like Victor Oladipo, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine etc for 8-10 poss a game they really had him do it 2-5.  His best matchups are probably 3s and 4s. Every one of those wings I mentioned above I would trust to put on him unless he were to suddenly start showing his age over night."
"it's been like 3 years dude, even Donovan Mitchell has gotten over it"
Zach Lavine is who Donovan Mitchell thinks he is
Clown. Donovan Mitchell? Really?
"Luckily there are a lot of those in the league rn, Donovan Mitchell, Jaylen Brown, obviously Steph and Bron..."
"No, I didn't forget when Donovan Mitchell and fucking Jamal Murray started dropping multiple prime Michael Jordan games in a single series.  It was an outlier. He hasn't played that well before, and he won't play that well again."
Yup same thing happened with Donovan Mitchell. Alot of fluke outlier performances and series in there
"The bubble was weird. It's that simple.   Jamal isn't like that - he never showed anything close to that before the bubble, and he's proving that it was a fluke afterwards   Same thing with Donovan mitchell  You shouldn't overreact to a 20 game sample with very very very weird circumstances  when you have hundreds of games saying something else."
He‚Äôs an utter clown. Compare his roster to what GS has and look what Steph is doing. Hell look at Utah and what Donovan Mitchell is doing without another superstar. This team is nowhere near bad enough to straight up quit.   Harden is a fraud....like many of us have been saying all along
Donovan Mitchell has also been lackluster compared to his bubble performance
"poor mans tyrese maxey, donovan mitchell was on fire"
Donovan Mitchell boutta hit you w dictionary.com
He should of left Steph to play alongside Donovan Mitchell
Donovan Mitchell also out
"This one was pretty well earned, Donovan Mitchell got absolutely raked through the coals by Mikal Bridges."
"Not saying I'd do the trade, but it makes me so sad we missed out on OG by 1 pick. He would fit our team so well, I definitely regret not keeping the pick and taking him more than I regret Jazz drafting Mitchell with it -- since Donovan wasn't really on our radar to begin with"
"Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Zach LaVine, Michael Porter Jr, Sabonis, Bam Adebayo, SGA all picked past 10. Nowadays with all the young talent coming in, drafts are deep. This isn‚Äôt 2001"
"I'm 6'4"" without shoes. That means I am taller than...  - Steph Curry - Kyrie Irving - Russell Westbrook - Donovan Mitchell - John Wall - Kemba Walker - Kyle Lowry - Fred VanVleet  ... among others, and three inches or less shorter than:  - Kawhi Leonard - Jimmy Butler - DeMar DeRozan - Zach LaVine - OG Anunoby - Draymond Green  - Klay Thompson  ... yet I am the complete opposite of an athlete lol"
Donovan Mitchell being only 6'1. I thought he was like 6'4 ish

"It's hard to say because I feel like what seperates stars and Superstars is consistent performance.      We've seen how good guys like Paul George, Kyrie Irving, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum and others can be when they're at their best and it's comparable with top tier players but the best of the best just do it more frequently."
"CJ McCollum  is averaging 28/4/5  while shooting 44% on 11 3PA and this dude has De'Aaron Fox, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Chris Paul, and frickin Shai Alexander above him on his list."
Zion and Donovan Mitchell over Ingram and PG?????
"Because for the most part NBA rookies are teenagers and MLB rookies are grown men. Devin Williams was a 25 year old rookie who had spent a lot of time developing in the minor leagues. He's older than Jokic, Tatum, Luka, Jaylen Brown, Donovan Mitchell, and is the same age as Giannis. You really can't compare a baseball rookie to other sports rookies.  Baseball rookies can even play a year in the majors and still be called rookies if they're called up late enough it's really not the same."
"nope not at all its more about you just being wrong and not facing facts. Stop being so senstive.  Who is pushing Jaylen brown, donovan mitchell, Cp3, etc to speak up. You just want to push your own narrative buddy its clear."
His shooting splits aren‚Äôt even that bad this season if u take a look (except for free throws) 43-39-66. Shooting better than Donovan Mitchell and roughly same as DeAaron Fox (small sample ik)
"Shouldve been one last year too, ppl put this guy behind donovan mitchell  lol."
"I'll give Tatum defense for sure, and he's definitely out playing donovan so far this season. I can concede a slight edge overall to Tatum, but I wouldn't call it comfortable. Mitchell has had higher peaks imo."
&gt;Donovan Mitchell type ceiling  This is James EdWaRD HaRdEn Jr.
"Don‚Äôt care. You‚Äôre entitled to your opinion I‚Äôm entitled to mine. Harden is getting old, only has 2 years left and is a toxic locker room presence. Maxey has many years left with us, is far cheaper and I believe he has a Donovan Mitchell type ceiling. Utah (rightfully so) sure as hell wouldn‚Äôt trade him for Harden. Kid just dropped 39 in his 10th NBA game. I‚Äôd rather trade Ben for LaVine then trade our depth and chemistry for your boy."
"39 points on 33 shots isn't AWESOME if you're, like, donovan mitchell or devin booker. 39 on 33 is fucking incredible for a late first round rookie making his first start as the guy getting the most defensive attention. wild statistical line to see from him in this one."
He legitimately reminds me of rookie Donovan Mitchell out there. Definitely earned himself more minutes moving forward

"I retract my earlier statement claiming that Devin Booker is better than Donovan Mitchell, the events that transpired at Little Caesars in Detroit on Friday evening is unacceptable"
&gt; Although I pray Ingles chooses to when he retires  I can just imagine him roasting Donovan Mitchell when he makes a highlight reel dunk
He deserves to be hated after he stole ROY Award from Donovan Mitchell. I remember that day like yesterday. Sad day for Jazz fans.
I missed watching this Donovan Mitchell play so much
"Hey guys, my friend Donovan Mitchell has been missing since August. Have any of ya'll seen him?"
Brandon Ingram vs Donovan Mitchell last season
"Probably the most recent was the Jamal Murray vs Donovan Mitchell duel. Man, they should have put Duel of the Fates over that one, it was pretty legit."
"So happier to continue a first round exit than to improve?  Man, you deserve better, gotta give yourself and the franchise some love.  It's okay to demand better than Donovan Mitchell, you can still like a dude playing hoopy ball when he wears jerseys admittedly much uglier than any Utah would ever."
I hope he gets to Donovan Mitchell level (who I see as probably a top 20 player).
He should try the Donovan Mitchell over head gather then dribble next time. Keep pushing the envelope.
Iverson was an insane football player. Charlie ward won the Heisman. Anthony Edward's prefer football if I'm not mistaken. Pat connaughton got drafted into the minor leagues. I think the plumlee brothers were multi sport. Don't know about this one but i thought Donovan Mitchell was good at baseball. Steph is amazing at golf. Cp3 is really good at bowling. I'm sure I'm missing a ton
Donovan Mitchell is pretty close iirc
Stole Rookie of the Year from Donovan Mitchell in his 2nd season.
I don't know why everybody is saying Donovan. He had a fantastic career so far and I think he can allways bring you numbers like that. I will never be suprised if Mitchell is averaging 45 for a week or something. Underrated player.
"Ya they should also go for Kyrie, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Mitchell Robinson and Christian Wood."
donovan mitchell
"Meh. Mitchell really didn‚Äôt look like a top 5 player. His performance was situational and anyone should understand that. Utah didn‚Äôt have their second leading scorer, the whole team was cold, and they were playing a team who routinely allow perimeter players to go off. It was a recipe for Donovan to go off. But shouldn‚Äôt be seen as a new norm for him."
Donovan Mitchell
Donovan Mitchell. Those two guys clearly arent anywhere close to top 10 players yet in the bubble they comfortable looked like top 5 players.
gordon hayward donovan mitchell
"Player B is Donovan Mitchell, no idea who player A is"
"The Knicks came out HARD in the second half and the Jazz clearly couldn't keep up. Maybe they were gassed coming off of a back to back. However, there were also some key adjustments by Thibs leading to the win: 1) Running Mitch PnRs from the elbow with a shooter in the strong side corner whenever Gobert was on the bench. Yielded a lot of open looks and alley oops. 2) Letting Randle post up Gobert. Seems stupid but Randle's lower center of gravity helped him get good position under Gobert and Randle was hitting these hooks over the DPOY. 3) Playing Payton, who was great this game, the whole 2nd half and not letting Quickley play. Quickley was getting locked up by the Jazz on switches, while Payton was able to captilize on those switches by penetrating against the opposing big OR identifying that Randle ended up with a mismatch for a post up. (Jazz doubled those, but Randle passed out quickly EVERY TIME to put the Jazz in rotation).  On the Jazz's side, Donovan Mitchell clearly had a bad game and that helped us a lot. He started to get hot in the fourth but wasn't really hitting shots. Some of them were makable for him, so gotta assume he was tired also. I was really impressed with Royce O'Neal, that dude is an EXCELLENT wing; he shoots well, and on D he absolutely locked up everybody but Rivers to the point that Thibs had to sit Barrett in the 4th. I thought Snyder coached an ok game but if both Conley and Mitchell are going to have off nights there's not much you can do, especially given how hard the Knicks played on D in the 2nd half.  Awesome game. Love the comeback. Hope the Jazz find their rhythm soon, I really like this team on paper but Conley has to improve for them to raise their ceiling. Right now they are a high-floor, low-ceiling team to me but don't feel like a true contender. We'll see."
Donovan Mitchell has also been a solid voice.
Him and Donovan Mitchell always take lead on this kind of stuff and I love to see it. Gives me hope that the next generation will be paying attention to the problems we have now.
donovan mitchell and mike conley are enjoying shooting me out of a W in fantasy this week feels good man
So only 12 players are worth max contracts? Should the teams that don't have a top 12 player just let them go and go back to being shit?   That means probably 20-23 teams will be shit. That's alot of teams to beat to get a chance at a top pick.   So maybe I should re-sign my best player who's between top 20-25 anyway so I can put out a good product and see what happens in the playoffs. That seems like a better idea than constantly being shit and hoping I hit on a player in the draft like Donovan Mitchell.
Donovan Mitchell has been having slow starts since forever
"Gobert is one of the best rim protectors ,rebounders  and roll men inthe league what does Donovan Mitchell do at that level?"
trade us Donovan Mitchell and we‚Äôll consider giving y‚Äôall Reggie Bullock

Donovan Mitchell was fucking great in the playoffs.
Donovan Mitchell was better than Giannis lol
"I was in Las Vegas when Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert first touched down in America. There was a bus, this is a true story. There was a bus that pulled up to a red light, and Donovan Mitchell tried to feed it a carrot, while Rudy Gobert was petting it. He thought it was a horse.   This really happened. He tried to feed a bus a carrot, and now you're telling me that utah has computers? I didn't know that, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT!"
Donovan Mitchell tried to feed a bus a carrot and now you‚Äôre telling me that state has computers? I didn‚Äôt know that!
he also just doesnt get calls. like he drove to the bucket 3-4 times tonight right into defenders chest no call. donovan mitchell got 5 body bump foul calls tonight. its infuriating to watch some guys get calls while guys like drose and kyrie almost never get calls. Boston/cleveland fans complained about it a lot when they were on their teams as well.
Bruh Donovan Mitchell was not the problem this game
Jazz need Bubble Legend Donovan Mitchell badly damn  When does he come back?
I have Donovan Mitchell as a top 10 SG but not top 5. Thats just me though. DWade was hands down top 5 while he was in his prime so i dont see the comparison.
Ive always said I think Donovan Mitchell ends up being more like 85-90% of what Gilbert Arenas was as a player comp more than Wade.
I see the similarity in that they use their athleticism to get buckets and are both capable playmakers from the 2 guard but d wade was always closer to 7 assists per game while Mitchell is at 4 or 5. D wade was also an ELITE perimeter defender. Donovan mitchell is ten times the three point shooter wade was but that could also lead to taking lower percentage shots since he‚Äôs chucking up 6 threes a game and d wade was maybe shooting one per game. And the big one as you said - I don‚Äôt think Donovan Mitchell is good enough to be the best player on a championship team. I know you said the teams are different but that‚Äôs not something you can throw to the side. Just my thoughts. I do like watching Mitchell play though.
"Didn‚Äôt Denver do the same thing with Donovan Mitchell? What I‚Äôm trying to say is, Utah is a good today b\c of trades with Denver."
A) Curry B) Jaylen C) Wiseman D) Joel E) Donovan Mitchell :) F) Jazz vs Sixers G) Jazz  I‚Äôm being optimistic. Very optimistic.
"no, it's not. People like you act like the Jazz chose Gobert over prime Jordan. They didn't! The either paid Gobert and kept a successful team together that's won lots of games or what? Got rid of Gobert and built around nothing? This team is built on Gobert's defense. Donovan Mitchell isn't a good enough offensive player to really carry a team and make them an offensive juggernaut. Not every team can have a top 5 scorer and make the conference finals every year.  Of course you'd choose Durant over Gobert. But the Jazz did the best thing to keep a competitive team together, that's a good move."
"yeah they didn't pick ty lawson, denver did. it was a Donovan mitchell type thing, not a luka and trae thing."
"Dtown Nuggets trading Donovan Mitchell to the Jazz for Trey Lyles and Tyler Lydon. I guess you can add Rudy Gobert as well, since we drafted, then traded him for Erick Green and cash.smh The Nuggets really drafted and handed Utah both their franchise players.smh I often think about what that starting line up would‚Äôve looked like with Murray, Mitchell, MPJ, Joker and Gobert.lol Bol bol off the bench. Wild."
"Could have played a role. I also wondered if guys were brow-beaten so much over the years about hot dogging it in the open floor that they finally heeded everyone's advice and started being all business instead.   Maybe it'll be cyclical and it'll come back around when some players of high repute decide they want to make a point of demolishing rims every night. But for now, definitely feels like we're in an era for the game's top players just aren't about that life (shout out to Donovan Mitchell and Ja Morant for their high-flying work, however)."
Donovan Mitchell and Steph.
Those are Donovan Mitchell numbers!
"Per Bleacher report the tenth best small forward might be Bogdan, Ingles or Will Barton.  9-11 best point guards are CP3, Donovan Mitchell and Kyle Lowry.  Given the relative scarcity of wings and our overreaction to a couple of sub-par playoff performances PG is among the more underrated players around."

Lol Donovan Mitchell knows what‚Äôs up. He‚Äôs a redditor on r/nba
Donovan Mitchell seems to start every season like complete ass until every other ballhandler on the Jazz gets hurt at which point he becomes amazing
did Anthony Edwards just say he looked up to Donovan Mitchell?

"Huge Donovan Mitchell fan, of course. He always has a rough start to the season, and I of course know how well he played in the bubble playoffs. I‚Äôm just commenting on what I see right now"
Now you‚Äôre just being crazy. Also got to imagine the message it sends to Donovan Mitchell if they let the best teammate he‚Äôs had for his entire career so far walk.
DM  Dejounte Murray  Donovan Mitchell  Dan Majerle  Danny Manning  Dikembe Mutumbo
"Dude has choked multiple years in the playoffs, got handled by Rookie Donovan Mitchell, got fucking wiped by the Blazers, lost to the Nuggets in literally the most embarrassing way imaginable. He has lost series every year that his team should have won, that‚Äôs a choke."
"I love Shaq as a player. I think he‚Äôs one of the best ever. I watched him and OBVIOUSLY he‚Äôs better than Gobert. But over his last 5 years Gobert has averaged 18.9 rebounds per 100 possessions, and Shaq never exceeded that mark in a season. Rudy is one of the best rim protectors and defensive 5‚Äôs of the last 20 years, and gets you an efficient 15-20 points a night. Can he be your first or 2nd best player on a championship team? I think with the right other pieces maybe. I‚Äôm not sure Donovan Mitchell can be the 1st. But this is a good, top 8 team in the league. And the idea they shouldn‚Äôt sign him, and so what? So they can find another top 3 center with the 27th pick?"
"Donovan Mitchell is way better than Gobert, come on man."
Hey remember when the Pistons didn't draft Donovan Mitchell? Good times.
"I feel like something switched toward the end of the season last year, pre-bubble. It may have been earlier, but the key moment that sealed it to me was BIs duel with Donovan Mitchell where he hit the game winner (in my opinion, ignoring the bad foul call and OT where the pels ended up winning anyway)."
Donovan Mitchell
Donovan Mitchell was leading his team to the playoffs from the jump but ok
That's Donovan Mitchell alright.
"I never realised cp3 and dame are like the exact same height till they were calling out the reserves and they were next to each other. I thought dame was listed at 6'3 and cp3 at 6'. Maybe because dame is a dunk threat I think he's taller... This goes for Donovan Mitchell too. Idk how Donovan is listed as 6', he used to be listed 6'3"""
"Shaq really is annoying as fuck. Everything he does is some transparent ploy to brag, and because of his fragile ego, he clearly can't even learn new things about the game he's paid to comment on. Every big man has to get 28 and 13? Are you kidding? No no no. You play to win, not to emulate your stat lines you goof. If you can't be the 1st option in a highly efficient offence, no, you shouldn't be trying to be something you can't be. Shaq's the type of guy who thinks that someone's defensive contribution can be summed up by steals + blocks. He played in a era where iso was way more dominant, so I understand some blind spots, but cmon man, this ain't that hard. And his BS trying to be a tough love father figure to grown men... the whole Mitchell thing. Embarrassing. I wish Donovan had told him to fuck off. Shaq doesn't know shit, and won't learn shit and it's annoying as hell. Candace is on the other extreme and we should all praise her contributions. She's thoughtful, show's humility towards the players and coaches and isn't busy counting her rings every 2 minutes. Please TNT. MORE CANDACE LESS SHAQ"
Whenever Donovan Mitchell posts a blm shirt he gets a bunch of shit from his own Utah fans on IG I‚Äôd never be willing to give a city like that a ring
"Breaking: Donovan Mitchell caught age shaming, jazz chemistry unsalvageable?!!!"
First Take tomorrow: Drama in Utah again? Is Donovan Mitchell an ageist?
"Nah Donovan Mitchell won, he thinks he can‚Äôt lose!"

Donovan Mitchell talked a lot of shit only to put up weak numbers
"As far as Donovan Mitchell is concerned, Team Durant won the first three quarters."
"It's just sad nobody good does it anymore.  Imagine if it were guys like Zion, Giannis, Donovan Mitchell, and Ben Simmons out there"
"How to fix dunk contest:  1. Get 5 judges and keep same 5 judges every year. Maybe throw in 1 or 2 guest judges occasionally. They mix up the cast every year and each person has their own objective opinions. Causes a lot of inconsistency round to round, year to year.  2. Develop some type of general grading system. Every judge, commentator has their own set of ‚Äúunwritten rules.‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt need to be a perfect science , but getting all judges on board with a few basic principles. Example; you can‚Äôt get 10 if it isn‚Äôt your first attempt.   3. I know Covid precautions are influence this year, but moving forward, having the players present and maybe even on outskirts of the court will make it more hype, more playground-ish. You‚Äôll get much better reactions. Post dunks will be more hype.   I‚Äôm not sure how to do it, but Dunk contest is sorely missing big name players. Think of the best dunk contests.. ok, now think of your favorite dunkers.. it‚Äôs always the BIG name all-stars... MJ, Vince, Blake, Lavine. Casuals don‚Äôt know or care about Obi Or Simons. Maybe a bigger prize pool? Big donation from league to their favorite charity? Idk... all I know is dunk contest is on its last leg and we need a Zion, Morant, Lavine, Donovan Mitchell. Make it happen NBA"
Ugh Zach shoot you're better than Donovan Mitchell

"If you watch the videos, point counts got fucked up. For example with Donovan Mitchell, his point count went real slow, only showed 1 on his first rack when he had 4. His count was frozen at times, he was actually at 12 going into the final racks."

They gave Donovan Mitchell 3 points for no reason in the middle of the second last rack.   https://streamable.com/59qhmy

"Donovan Mitchell for 3PT champ, All-Star MVP, FMVP, and father of my children."
"So would you say Donovan Mitchell has top 10 player potential since he‚Äôs leading the Jazz to the best record in the league? What about Devin Booker? Personally I think Beal is and will continue to be better than both of them, but your logic would place them ahead of him in terms of ceiling, correct? Is Paul George a top 10 player? No way he leads a team as the number one option.   I agree he probably isn‚Äôt capable of being the guy on a championship team (although look at who he‚Äôs played with throughout his career...he hasn‚Äôt benefited from playing with all around great teams like others have), but I still think you can be a top 10 player and not be capable of being that guy. Melo was top 10 for years and never good enough to be that guy. Neither was Chris Paul. I‚Äôm cherry picking players but you get my point."
Someone tell Donovan Mitchell
"100% lmao if Donovan ""Runner-up"" Mitchell had just chilled the fuck out instead of going like 0-10 in the last 3 minutes they'd probably have won. They made like 18 more 3s than us lmfao"
That sure worked out well for Donovan Mitchell last night in OT.
"The way he's playing right now, you can put Donovan Mitchell anywhere."
Donovan Mitchell is the face of the best team in the NBA. Of course he‚Äôs going to be overrated.
In the moment the out of bounds call felt awful. It was in hindsight the right call considering it touched the official per the rules. The communication at least to the tv audience was awful which led to even announcers from both teams confusion. The Donovan Mitchell jump into the defender 3 should have been an offensive foul on the Jazz. The Ben Simmons grabbing Mitchell that was called an offensive was one of the worst calls I've seen in a while. The refs were bad both ways period. And it's a core issue in the league. A refs job is hard. They will never get it all correct but for a number one seed head to head matchup we deserved better as fans and the athletes deserved better as well.
&gt; Because the front page of this site would have you believe the refs stole this game from the Jazz.   LOL what are you on about? The front page is full of posts harping on Mitchell for 'whining' about refs while putting up terrible stats at the end of the game.  This is typical r/nba behavior. The refs are bad unless a small market complains about it and then suddenly everyone on this sub thinks the refs are the most un-biased arbiters of justice the world has ever seen.  Take a look at [this](https://twitter.com/bballbreakdown/status/1367303855516491776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1367303855516491776%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fclutchpoints.com%2Fjazz-news-video-proof-of-donovan-mitchell-bizarre-offensive-foul-call-jordan-clarkson-reacts%2F) and tell me it's not a ridiculous call.
"I completely understand the frustration on the Royce O‚ÄôNeale out of bounds play. If roles were reversed I‚Äôd be salty as hell as well, but by the rule book and on the Secaucus review, it was called as it should be.   I also don‚Äôt think that Donovan Mitchell should have received 2 technicals in OT just based off the footage, but who knows what was said on court. Either way, not a fan of technicals unless they‚Äôre ridiculously earned.   The other ‚Äúcontentious‚Äù calls like Mitchell‚Äôs offensive foul. He did arm hook Simmons first, and Simmons did retaliate with a good bit of arm hooking himself. See that one called either way. If the offensive foul wasn‚Äôt called it definitely could‚Äôve been a travel and regardless the shot missed and the Sixers got the rebound right as the whistle was called.   Mitchell sitting there complaining when he did a hip check to the left to Seth Curry to get 3 FTs is pretty hilarious.   Gobert complaining when he was not called for a single illegal screen, despite in OT both pivoting, elbowing and jersey grabbing all in one play to open up a wide open 3? Also pretty hilarious."
"Hi Haley! Big fan of your work, can't wait to listen to the new podcast. My question is simple. Who wins a 1v1 between Donovan Mitchell and Jarrett Jack?"
"Yeah, I edited as you were writing that I think. That makes more sense. Without seeing the data behind it though I find it hard to take this as proof that the league is biased against the Jazz. Also that was from before Donovan Mitchell was in the NBA"
Donovan mitchell is not wrong. The NBA REFS are the biggest weasels you can encounter in profesional sports. Some of the bullshit they missed or have called on people is just astonishing.g
"Might want to edit that to attribute it to Donovan Mitchell, not Harrell."
Donovan [Stan](https://i.imgur.com/5DrWXrw.jpg) Mitchell
"I know, I‚Äôm just saying that it‚Äôs a little unfair to give credit to Cassell for making the WCF just because he played with one of the best PF of all time. I don‚Äôt think Jeff Hornacek is better than Donovan Mitchell just because he made the Finals with Stockton and Malone, just as an example."
Yea i agree with u/wordsmatteror_w_e there is no way donovan mitchell is a good enough player to accomplish that. It would be impossible.
*Donovan Mitchell has been banned from /r/hydrohomies*
"Donovan ""Stop The Count"" Mitchell"
"Lol, jazz fans really showed their true colors last night.  What a bunch of sore losers.   The flow of the game changed when Donovan Mitchell tried to posterize Embiid, and it set Embiid off. Then of course Mitchell starts throwing up his hero ball prayers, bc that's what he does. You realize the jazz blew their lead against the sixers bench?  The jazz players and fans really need to take a look in the mirror. Embarrassed yourselves last night on so many levels."
"I guess a good sign was Joel prodding Donovan Mitchell off the court by patting him on the back when he got ejected. I thought it should‚Äôve been a technical from the precedents set earlier in the game, but a good sign it wasn‚Äôt called"
"What a clown shoes comment. 40/19 says the opposite. Calls were bad on both ends. Mitchell got away with plenty all game, including his ludicrous shot motion in OT.   I‚Äôd counter your point and say that the 6ers/refs frustrated the hell out of Donovan, leading to him playing hero ball, taking bad shots, and selfishly taking 2 T‚Äôs that gave the sixers points and got Mitchell booted.   I feel good about it all"
"Death, Taxes, Donovan Mitchell playing Hero Ball at the end of the game. These are all guaranteed."

Can you believe the refs stole this game? Anybody notice the random Technical Foul dump where Donovan Mitchell went from 0 to 2. Got damn dominion scoring systems
"Your timeline is out of order, the hook happened well before the spin.   * Mitchell put his straight arm past Simmons body.  No hooking yet.  * Simmons then reached in, hooked, and clamped down.  The replay for this submission starts at this point. * They continued driving toward the basket for a good 2 seconds.   * Donovan spun.  Simmons kept hooking and then let go."
"Yes because we all know that all the refs are a huge fan of Joel Embiid, and even the Sixers in general for that matter *sarcastically*. I‚Äôve been a Donovan Mitchell fan since he was in college, and I like how he handled it in the post-game interview, but he can‚Äôt blame the refs for that loss. He shot shit from the field and flipped out when Embiid got pushed in the back by Rudy who didn‚Äôt even contest the ball. The refs are in neither of these teams favor and the game was over before Mitchell fouled out. I have so much respect for Donovan, and I know the refs are shit, but I wished could have handled it a little bit better."
Donovan Mitchell kinda looks like Naomi Osaka
fuck. sixers 0-1 in the Donovan Mitchell Opinion Standings. playoff chances look grim.
Maybe Donovan Mitchell should stop acting like a baby back bitch and getting all up in his feelings when he plays us.
"It‚Äôs not an argument, it was a joke poking fun at Donovan Mitchell and the other guy completely freaked out because I used an emoji, that Donovan used."
I think Donovan Mitchell gets frustrated in general when he has an off night. He's very passionate and gives is his all (usually)
I mean what does he want me to say lol. Oh no you went through my comment history and caught me being salty on reddit. Guess that means Donovan Mitchell is a pure class act who has never been salty in his life

I unfortunately missed this game but nothing is more Donovan Mitchell than 33 points on 34 shots lol
they should mail this to Donovan Mitchell lmao
"Oh everyone in the nba does the 3 pt fake, players have to stop jumping to contest them at this point. There are cases where it‚Äôs legit but the jumping into people outside your natural body movement is annoying as hell.   Donovan coming out post game whining about everything when he does that and missed like 5 contested layups and had 33 pts on 34 attempts though is...rich. And I actually really like Mitchell for everything he does and says off the court as a person. But his presser was a joke. There‚Äôs countless missed fouls every night both ways just like this game, Dwight and Jo were getting hacked tonight and should‚Äôve had more FTs too. Jazz also blew multiple 10 pt leads, blaming refs is weak. Esp when you‚Äôre still the best team in the nba"
"I‚Äôm pretty sure Embiid has said he doesn‚Äôt talk shit to Jokic because Jokic never responds. He only talks a lot of shit to people he knows will react, which turns out include Donovan Mitchell and a sizeable portion of the rest of the league"
Sorry to disappoint. Shot doesn‚Äôt count. Donovan Mitchell wins MVP and ROTY.
What I'm mad about is 33 points on 34 shots by Donovan Mitchell. The Jazz's true achilles heel is him playing hero ball.
It‚Äôs a shame that the refs shot 12-34 from the field for Donovan Mitchell
You take 33pts on 34 shots everyday from donovan mitchell.  His frustration during the game and whining for the past hour after the game has a lot to do with getting dogged by Ben D all night.

Donovan has always been pro Booker in his social tweets. We were blinded by our meaningless debate BETWEEN Booker OR Mitchell. It's time we bury the hatchet and agree its Booker AND Mitchell. The NBA done fk up now. House Jansuzz be killing the league
Can someone tag the entire state of Utah and Donovan Mitchell in this post?
"Donovan ""I deserve to win RotY over Ben based on etymology"" Mitchell"
idk the dude ragging on donovan mitchell all the way down the tunnel after his techs was pretty bad hahhaa
Donovan Mitchell told me that the rockets actually won the game.
Some real Iverson like statlines tonight between these two and Donovan Mitchell
"&gt;Murray will always be a far superior scorer.   Far superior? Lmfao this one caught me off guard. SGA is having a better scoring season in his 3rd season than Murray is having in his 5th. I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre both just as good at scoring.  And if we‚Äôre going to bring up the playoffs, we already know those 50 point games were fluke-ish. Donovan Mitchell dropped 50 in that same series.  Not saying it wasn‚Äôt impressive, but let‚Äôs be honest: 2nd tier stars putting up 50 in a playoff game is an extremely rare occurrence. Before the bubble, the last time that occurred was Isaiah Thomas in 2017, who was a *much* better scorer than Mitchell or Murray."
Cool you thought the mitchell getting the foul call wasnt a flop? When he literally moved into Seth?   Replays on the Embiid foul show Harris and Simmons were fouled. Rudy pushed Embiid.   You guys got plenty of calls your way. But a couple don't go your way and Donovan has fucking melt down over it
"Donovan ""I deserve to win RotY over Ben based on etymology"" Mitchell"
"Donovan Mitchell on his technicals tonight: ""This is getting out of hand. Now there are two of them!"""
"Donovan Mitchell, your 2021 Sookie Of The Year."
"[Woj] Utah Jazz F Donovan Mitchell has been fined $69,420 for comments made against refereeing on Wednesday."
"As a counterpoint, at the end of 4Q and OT:  - Gobert brings his arm and shoulder down into Embiids shot with a lot of contact and no call.   - Donovan Mitchell initiates the contact on a 3 by jumping to the side on his corner 3, which by league rule is not a foul on the defender  - Rudy Gobert at the top of the arc on a double screen  pivoted as he screened and grabbed the defenders jersey to open up a wide open (Bogdonovic i think?) 3.   I do think the O‚ÄôNeale play was BS, but they did call that one by the books. That‚Äôs a rule that should probably be revisited this offseason.   Not saying we didn‚Äôt benefit from calls - absolutely we did - just saying there were some head scratching moments on both sides tonight"
donovan mitchell was 12-34 but it was the refs i guess
"I'm not a math wiz but there seems to be a strong correlation between Harden's avg FTA per game and his PPG. https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hardeja01.html  He's led the league in free throw attempts since 2012-13! and been at the top of the scoring charts while not being the absolute most efficient player. The years he won the scoring title, in 18 and 19, and 20 (god damn) he was averaging 20+ shots at around 45% which is great but certainly not what you need to avg 30+ PPG. Those numbers are closer to someone like Derozan, a killer Monta Ellis, or Donovan Mitchell. Great players and all-stars but not guys who won multiple scoring titles.   Yes. Harden's use of foul-baiting absolutely led to him being able to score so much and I remain doubtful he'll ""figure it out"" and go back to averaging 36 points a night or even break 25 honestly now that he's much older, perpetually out of shape, and not the lead scorer on the team. Nets fans should be happy if he ends up averaging 20 by the end of the year. Which sounds crazy but he did 24 last year WITH the foul baiting."
I think Donovan Mitchell and one or 2 of Boston's guys will end up going to NY. It won't be like the Heatles but I think Mitchell has the cachet to recruit guys if he gets out of Utah.
suns use a variety of on and off ball screens to get favorable mismatches so there was no marquee iso matchup like donovan mitchell/dame lillard/cj mccollum  but they did try posting jae crowder on him lol
I‚Äôm not sure the exact trades but the picks that became Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert originally belonged to Denver
"I've always thought of Donovan Mitchell as a great passer but not as much of a playmaker, as an example.  He can whip some insane baseball cross-court passes."
*Donovan Mitchell nods with approval*
Trading Donovan Mitchell for Trey Lyles and the pick that became Tyler Lydon because you think you‚Äôre gonna get OG Anunoby later is peak NuggLyfe. We also drafted Gobert and traded him to the Jazz.   Utah owes their entire franchise to Nuggets incompetence.
"Or Shaq and Donovan Mitchell. Or Shaq and Rudy Gobert.  You know, I think it's a Shaq thing"
Aight. -Donovan Mitchell
"I know Lee is my most admired NBA player.  Grad transfer to UofL to compete for a NCAA chip with DONOVAN MITCHELL. Get's impeded with a school-imposed postseason ban.  Says fuck it, goes to the draft and puts in work in the G-League.  Gets a two-way contract.  ***Puts a ring on and A BABY IN Steph's sister.***  And now I wait, as a Louisville homer, for his thoroughbred sharpshooter progeny to announce they're committing to UofL."
"&gt; It‚Äôs about the best prospect at the draft by the majority consensus, going into the draft on that draft night.   Nah man this is your problem. Where can I go to lookup the majority consensus best player available on draft night for picks 2-15 or whatever? Nowhere. Its impossible. It doesn't exist. You can have people posting their picks and getting a lot of likes, but there is no way to know that. People just use hindsight and pretend like it was obvious on draft night.    So a lot of people are reading your post and thinking ""no shit you can do this for every team"" and you probably can. My knicks could have Donovan Mitchell and Michael porter Jr. Who was the best player available according to majority for those picks? DSJ and MPJ? Idk."
That‚Äôs not even the worst Jazz related trade we‚Äôve had this decade. We traded the pick that would become Donovan Mitchell for Trey fuckin Lyles. Now that‚Äôs one that keeps me up at night
Then they did the Jazz a solid again by trading Donovan Mitchell for Trey Lyles
Atleast you didn‚Äôt trade Donovan Mitchell for him‚Ä¶
"yea cause Donovan Mitchell carries his ass. the one game he missed, Gobert scored a whole 11 points in a loss to the Grizz lmao"

Donovan Mitchell put up similar numbers with the Jazz as the best team last season. Not a single thought of MVP. I doubt Lavine gets any.
Broke: Donovan Mitchell going 1/9 from 3  Woke: Donovan Mitchell going 8/11 from 2
donovan mitchell proud member of the shanghai sharks
Donovan Mitchell is a fucking problem right now. And not in a good way.
"I love Donovan Mitchell, but he has to stop thinking he's fucking Superman.  You can't split 3 guys and get to the rim with 6 left to shoot."
"&gt; Lavine isn‚Äôt as good a playmaker as Beal, Booker, Jamal Murray or Donovan Mitchell, but he‚Äôs a better scorer than all of them‚Äî  K  But you started by saying they were worse, so who the fuck has the shorter attention span?"
Free Donovan Mitchell!!! He needs to come home to the Knicks. He deserves it
Donovan Mitchell is a good SG and he should be happy D wade chose to impart his greatness on the franchise.
Who out of these 30 are you taking Gobert over? Serious question  Kevin Durant  Giannis Antetokounmpo  LeBron James  Stephen Curry  Kawhi Leonard  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Joel Embiid  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Damian Lillard  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Bradley Beal  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Kyrie Irving  Trae Young  Zion Williamson  Donovan Mitchell  Khris Middleton  Karl-Anthony Towns  Bam Adebayo  Jaylen Brown  Jrue Holiday  Zach LaVine  Deandre Ayton   Ja Morant  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander
Zach Lavine is better than Dbook and donovan mitchell
"Lavine isn‚Äôt as good a playmaker as Beal, Booker, Jamal Murray or Donovan Mitchell, but he‚Äôs a better scorer than all of them‚Äî especially if he gets to play off the ball. He‚Äôs the scoring guard every superstar‚Äî especially the heliocentric types‚Äî would kill to play with. I‚Äôm not sure the general NBA public understands the guy is just a paragon of efficiency."
"came down to him vs lillard, i prefer lillard, but am not gonna fight you if you think luka is better.  that is the tricky part, such a huge glut of top end talent in the league. on any given night, 25 guys can look like top 10 guys.  hon mention: luka, cp3, jimmy butler, tatum, pg, zion, brad beal, trae young, donovan mitchell, kat, d book.  luka probably wouldnt make my top ten list, but he belongs in tier 3 imo"
"No, you're thinking of Davion Mitchell, this is Donovan Mitchell."
I would argue that Zach Lavine/Donovan Mitchell archetype isn‚Äôt as good as Anthony Davis/ Bam Adebayo archetype
"Donovan Mitchell has a creative and aesthetic game imo, along with crazy bounce. Love his scoop shots near the rim"
Donovan Mitchell and Trae Young
Toss up.. Dame or Donovan Mitchell.  Hard to pick.
"Giannis, Donovan Mitchell, Joel and Julius. Like a lot of players not on my team. I just love basketball"
"Certainly, but you could say that about anyone based on where they were drafted alone. I just don‚Äôt know how valuable that is. I‚Äôm not predicting anything about his career, but I appreciate his level of effort on the defensive end. He‚Äôs fun to watch if anything. Let him prove whether or not he deserves accolades. Through this point, he‚Äôs done pretty well, but he‚Äôs had to guard three of the best guards in the west in Curry, Lillard and Donovan Mitchell. Luckily, we‚Äôll get to see how it goes."
Correction. The Jazz except Donovan Mitchell peak during the regular season.
"&gt;*This moreso LeBron than the Lakers tbh*  Yessss.  Players all have different motivations too. Giannis used to be very competitive vs. Cavs when Bron was there but he also liked dunking on the Knicks because they didn't come visit him to scout him in Greece like the other teams had haha.  Ja Morant likes battling against Russ, and that applies for whatever team he is on at the time.  Davion Mitchell really looked up to/studied Donovan Mitchell, so that matchup was going to be a little extra no matter what."
"People overreact on playoff performances too much as always, the small sample size in the playoffs has skyrocketed or has fucked up many players reputation, playoff runs especially like one series is just way too little as a sample size  Example: Donovan Mitchell, Ja Morant, Lillard for the positive side, Harden for the negative side, Harden is actually a better playoff performer than all of them but once you get a reputation good luck, Paul George as well"
Big big difference between the Pacers and the Jazz. The Jazz at least are one superstar jump from Donovan Mitchell away from being real contenders; the Pacers are a middling playoff team.
"We literally don‚Äôt know that he has. They‚Äôve played a couple games lol, this is absolutely not going to continue. People did this same thing with Donovan Mitchell or Murray. Had a crazy series then they think that means that‚Äôs a new norm for them and they end up being not so ouch different from the year before.   20 games in morant will be averaging 22-23ppg or something can bet your ass. Definite improvement but nothing like this 30ppg shit"
"If ja maintains anywhere close to this level, id take him over any regular season version of Donovan Mitchell"
"Just look at Donovan Mitchell. The guy massively elevates his play in the post season, but people still don‚Äôt give him the respect he deserves for how good he is. People discredit young players just because they‚Äôre young all the time."
Due to how the nba is played right now. Prime carmelo would basically be a taller faster stronger brand ingram. That's a scary sight to see.    Prime Dwight imagine on the Utah jazz instead of Rudy gobert would be a sight to see with Donovan Mitchell.  Prime melo on the lakers  cause of floor spacing
Donovan Mitchell will win MVP
Donovan Mitchell was limping through every game and dropped 32 ppg as well. He also was recovering from the exact injury LeBron had.
Donovan Mitchell
"since I haven't seen it mentioned, the main issue is that he needs the ball in his hands to even begin to be effective. Dubs offense is about ball movement and flow, and he disrupted both. his defense was also highly inconsistent. I wanted more back from him too but other than another draft pic there's no one on the Jazz roster that they would have agreed to give up that would be a better fit than what we ended up with in 'Beli' and 'Auto Corner Jr'.   also, if they legitimately did it partly because Eric wanted to be reunited with his childhood buddy Donovan Mitchell, then I would imagine that would mean something quite positive to the remaining players on the team; that management might actually give a fuck about players even when they're in the process of trading them."
Donovan Mitchell
"You're correct, him and Donovan Mitchell grew up together and are very close friends. The warriors were doing EP a favor and also demonstrating that they treat their players well, creating good favor."
"I'm almost 40, been watching NBA since i was 10 as much as possible, everynight got League pass on, love it man just like everybody else on here.  If there is one thing I've learned in that time, and this is just my opinion, is I literally dont judge rookies.  At all.  I've seen guys come in and rip like Brandon Jennings or Michael Carter Williams and flame out fast or guys come in and crush when not expected to and continue to build off that success like Donovan Mitchell.  Being a rook in the NBA would be so gnarly, the travel, setting up housing, dealing w fam and friends, large purchases left and right, the most travel you've ever done, women throwing themselves at you.  Thats not even on court stuff, traveling, new coach, new teammates, just so much.  Dont get me wrong, I'll follow rooks and scope them and see how they are doing, but i don't hold anything against them, good or bad.  Now year two, it's go time.  I expect them to improve and i think you get a more accurate barometer on how they will turn out to be.  Imagine judging these people based off their rookie year, let alone two games!  Kobe, Dirk, Marc Gasol, Kawhi, PG, Steve Nash, Ben Wallace or many many more."
"i honestly never thought they‚Äôd beat the Warriors with Curry having a great performance and then they won game 1 of the first round making them bring out Donovan Mitchell far sooner than they anticipated, this team is full of dogs"
"Chris Paul, Kiss Joe Ingles, Marry Donovan Mitchell"
I remember when Dennis Smith was the Donovan Mitchell of his draft
"Everyone shot well in the bubble for whatever reason, Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell were trading 50 point games off in the playoffs.   Those two seasons are gonna look weird."
"I remember him saying that and I believe it. Even before he tore his ACL, the Knicks had offered KP for a number of players and the trades were all shot down. Fox, Bagley, Donovan Mitchell, Booker, and a number of players were inquired about (most of those were in their rookie seasons I believe or early in the in their careers before they blew up a bit). Every team said no. I really don't think teams were as high on KP as fans were.  When we traded him, there was already the baggage of his brother, and rumors about him not wanting to work out with team trainers in the offseason, being a diva and a malcontent, etc. Once the ACL tear happened, I think the added fear of someone his size and build coming back from it was even more of a red flag. He had already racked up injuries all over his body at that point. If he lost some athleticism from the ACL tear, which was what made him intriguing, you wouldn't want to be the team to max him.  Cuban got a little caught by the shiny object floated at him since the Mavs can't get big name FAs, and he also took a bit of a calculated gamble. I'm glad the Knicks traded him when they did because even though KP said he planned to come back and play before the season ended, he later admitted he never planned to. So I think we would have gotten even worse of a deal in the summer. At least the Mavs got to see KP rehabbing and what kind of shape he might be in for a few months before having to max him."

Davion Mitchell is what Jazz fans expected Donovan Mitchell to be defensively.
"It's probably insane to say only 2 games into his career but is Davion Mitchell the best defensive guard in the league?  He's looked better guarding Donovan than Dort did the other night, I'm struggling to think of a guard who could shut Don down this well throughout an entire game.  He's single handedly going to make me watch the Kings play any team with an elite SG at this rate, I'm excited to watch him guard Harden."
"Fuck.  Oh well, at least Davion Mitchell clamped Donovan on two straight possessions."
Shit I didn't know Lou Will and Donovan Mitchell had a baby 20 years ago
"Casually watching this cheering for the Kings, but damn, what did Donovan Mitchell do to these refs to make them hate him so much?"
"Gobert by a good margin. Mitchell‚Äôs been insanely hot the last 2 playoffs, but that‚Äôs not the player he really is most days. If he‚Äôs really gonna shoot damn near 50% on 8 pull-up threes per game in the playoffs for the rest of his career, then yeah it‚Äôs probably Mitchell. But I really doubt that.  We stagger lineups with just Rudy and just Mitchell. The on-off data really doesn‚Äôt lie, Gobert has a much bigger influence on the game than Donovan."
Donovan Mitchell is even more offensive
"Alright, let me modify that statement, that's like saying Donovan Mitchell is better than Steph because the Jazz are better than the Warriors.  The point is, ranking Trae over Luka because of team success is incredibly stupid when one has arguably the deepest roster in the NBA whilst the other has a bunch of average players being coached by a literal moron."
"you know Donovan Mitchell has dropped 57 in the playoffs, right? But no one would consider him the #1 option on a championship winner right now. Not when he has to face off against KD, Giannis, LeBron, Steph, Kawhi, and Harden.  Idk man, you don't sound that convincing saying things like ""what!? Melo isn't the first option on a championship team?"" Has he ever been? No? Okay.  It's a pretty rare type of player. There are only ever a handful in the league at a time.  Dame has been the #1 option on a good team for a long time. It has never produced a championship or even a finals run. You're telling me if you switch him with LeBron or KD, that the Blazers aren't getting closer?"
Needs to have that grunting game like Donovan Mitchell
Perfect to help Donovan Mitchell develop tbh. Low key jealous tho lmao
&gt; Trae definitely has it.  I think so too.  But remember Donovan Mitchell after his breakout performance in the bubble?  He had to prove it again as well.  Young stars don't get the benefit of the doubt.
"Is it weird to say that on offense he‚Äôs kind of like Donovan Mitchell, but as a wing instead of a guard? Both came into the league as perceived slashers because of their incredible physical gifts, but have turned into outstanding shooters in the league over the years."
"I don't understand how Donovan Mitchell isn't getting more MVP buzz.  He's going to put up huge #s and be the best offensive player on what is by far the best team in the regular season, like, the Jazz might win 65+ games."

"Nahh. Wade played like a quicker Donovan Mitchell without the three, but more ferocious attacking the basket. Ant actually reminds me a bit of young Lebron. Just the raw power and explosiveness, makes it look easy. Like you can tell he is physically different from the rest."
You didn't just compare Sexton to Donovan Mitchell did you?
"Did you really use fungible to describe people? Just use the word interchangeable, you are not smarter than anyone because you are usinga new term.  And you just added to my point, Donovan is literally 2x the defender Sexton is. Sexton is skinny and small, Mitchell is stocky and uses his strength well. Something you would have to see in a basketball game and not just offensive highlights and statistics."
donovan mitchell is a 2x all star...
"&gt; e‚Äôs effectively a 2-guard in the body of a PG which creates problems everywhere.  So, Donovan Mitchell."
"In your opinion then, Donovan Mitchell or Jaylen Brown ?"
This is perhaps one of the single worst comments I've ever seen in /NBA. Donovan Mitchell is 10 times the player Collin Sexton is.
"Collin Sexton, years 2 and 3: 22/3.5/3 on 47/37/83  Donovan Mitchell, years 2 and 3: 24/4/4 on 44/36/83  Keep in mind, Mitchell is also a year older in each of those seasons."
"KAT isn‚Äôt a top ten player. See below, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm forgiving some other obvious inclusions.  Lebron Steph Jokic Luka KD Harden Giannis Devin booker Donovan Mitchell Embid Etc."
"2011-2012: Raja Bell, Devon Harris, Gordylox Hazelwood, Paul Millsap, and Al Jefferson.  2021-2022: Mike Conley, Donovan Mitchell, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neal, Rudy Gobert.  I've got my money on current team, but I would love to see Big Al post up against Rudy."
Donovan Mitchell to Alfa Romeo confirmed
"It depends on what his team does. I don't know how they'll play from here on out and I am not of those thinking that October games means much.  Yes normally he should be one of the favorites as he is ideally placed , i.e. plays on a contender and he is the clear best guy of the team. However the unknowns are far greater than the things we know. For all I know Donovan Mitchell has a breakout year and sails into the 1st seed, all the while the Bucks end up 2nd in the East. In that case the breakout player is the favorite.  Take Jokic, he was on noone's radar before last year (as a serious MVP candidate), but here we are: the unknowns far exceed the things we know."
"That thunder team was not that bad lol. They had PG and were the favorites. And the Jazz team they lost to, the best player was literally a rookie or second year Donovan Mitchell. I think the Jazz haven't made it past the first round since despite having better teams and a better Mitchell."
"nothing is worse than when donovan mitchell laid on the floor on the nuggets fast break in game fucking 7 only for the nuggets to miss, and gobert gets the rebound with 4 seconds left, but couldnt pass it to mitchell because he was ON THE GROUND LIKE A DUMBASS"
"Yeah, but I'm not here acting like Donovan Mitchell is a top 75 player of all time, do you see the difference?  And Utah was at least good enough to get a good seed and actually make it to the second round, so maybe do better this year before talking shit lmao."
"22-year-old scoring a moderately efficient 24ppg.   47.5% from the field, 37.1% from 3, 57.3 TS%. He's not a chucker by any measure.  It's a very fair request.   Looking at all +24ppg scorers ‚â§25-years-old from last season:    Player| Age| PPG ---|---|---- Zion Williamson| 20 | 27.0 **Collin Sexton**| **22** | **24.3** Luka Doncic| 22 | 27.7 Trae Young | 22 | 25.3 De'Aaron Fox| 23 | 25.2 Jayson Tatum| 23 | 26.4 Devin Booker| 24 | 25.6 Donovan Mitchell | 24 | 26.4 Jaylen Brown| 24 | 24.7 Karl-Anthony Towns| 25 | 24.8   I just don't see how Sexton doesn't clear 100m easily if he can keep it up. If you're in that age bracket and you're in that scoring bracket, it's a no-brainer.  We're not even talking about a 5-year max either."
Guaranteed success? If this guy sucks in the playoffs Booker gonna have to become Donovan Mitchell Super Saiyan mode‚Ä¶ to make it to the WCF!
With the exception of Trae Young Dame Lillard and maybe Devin Booker every high level offensive player in the NBA who shoulders a considerable offensive burden gives more defensive effort than Donovan Mitchell. Every single one. It's a joke.
I'm surprised the Jazz weren't in the former category. The only fanbase that might possibly hate Ben more than Philly is possibly the Jazz. Donovan Mitchell was the rightful ROTY
"Lmao he was playing as a 21st overall pick and a backup SG behind Donovan Mitchell on the Jazz who are notorious for developing their rookies over time and not forcing them into doing more than they can handle. After any rookie‚Äôs rookie season if you tell me that in the future that they would make $10m annually, that‚Äôs not a shocking number. That means he developed into a decent role player, like wtf is your question? You act like he just got paid the max."
"I mean if he walks after his next contract and we get Donovan Mitchell at a mid-round steal in the following draft, who says no?"
Suns miss the playoffs    Celtics finish 1st in the East    Portland vs Dallas WCF  AD won‚Äôt be considered a top 20-25 player after this season is done     Donovan Mitchell wins MVP
"Donovan Mitchell averages more points and has a higher ts% in the playoffs than Booker does, and that‚Äôs including every single playoff series he‚Äôs played in, not just this year."
Where‚Äôs Donovan Mitchell fit in here?
"If you have normal proportions then probably 6'3 or so minimum. The successful guards who are shorter than that (Donovan Mitchell, Rondo etc.) usually have abnormally large wingspans to make up for their short height.   Of course there are outliers like CP3 or Steph who are nothing special physically, but they're the exception"
"&gt;Nope. I know Gobert is better. I simply picked someone else that is also a top tier defensive center because everyone else would be saying the same answer (as well as the FT thing). Why do you think I picked someone like Klay over Thybulle even though the latter rn is the safer pick? It's simply more fun when everyone isn't giving the same exact answers on topic like this. That's just my thing.  brook is a good defensive center, gobert is an all-time great defensive center. there is already differences in people's responses, and it's far more interesting when those differences are justifiable in ways other than simply to be different. people could put lonzo in since ""well everyone is putting the same few guards in so i'm going to be different."" but in a post about best defensive teams that is simply unjustifiable. there is space to argue between players at similar levels defensively, there is no space to argue when one is clearly significantly better than the other.  &gt;I see things that I don't agree or think is dumb on this sub(any sub) all of the time, but I don't go around immediately insulting people for it. You know......like a person that isn't a blatant jerk and actually has a ounce of maturity would do? Like holy shit dude how socially stunted are you? You could have just disagreed, but nope, you had to be try and make it personal because that's just who you are. Pathetic. Here's hoping you are in fact a kid like I think you are because if you're an adult........yikes, you've got some catching up to do.  i'm sorry but putting brook lopez over gobert is idiotic.  &gt;It'd be stupid if I didn't have 2 specific reasons for my picks and I actually was making an argument that Lopez was better overall.....but I do and I'm not. And the answer was yes, you were going to double down more because of course someone like you would. You've got nothing for me.  so one reason is ""i don't want to choose the same people"" which as i explained earlier is bad reasoning. the second is ft% which i've already talked about and just isn't a reasonable argument in a post where it's talking purely defensively. like you can likely find 2 reasons to argue 1 player is greater than any other player, it doesn't make those reasons justified. like let's say if i wanted to say donovan mitchell is better than MJ, well 1 reason could be he's a better 3pt shooter, and maybe for a second i could argue well since if you asked a group of nba fans this question they'd pretty much all say MJ was better, well it would be boring if everyone said the same thing so that's a second reason why i'd say donovan mitchell is better. Can you see how that's poor reasoning for an argument that donovan mitchell is better than MJ?"
easiest way to see this is donovan mitchell at number five on all time playoff ppg
Donovan Mitchell wins MVP then gets traded in the offseason
Probably replace George with Donovan Mitchell otherwise seems good
Ask Donovan Mitchell
"My comp for his ceiling before the draft was Donovan Mitchell*1.15. He‚Äôs just 15% bigger, a 15% stronger, 15% more athletic. We‚Äôll see if the skill level follows suit, but it‚Äôs certainly been an encouraging past 35 games or so."
"I think my issue with this is that in the past few playoffs, it's not like the Jazz have been favorites in their matchups. People say he got played off the floor last year but he led the Jazz in minutes played and had a pretty good net rating.  The year before he wasn't great and the Rockets turned up the pressure on him. So yeah, that wasn't a great series. But no one brings up that Mitchell was abysmal in that series. It gets pinned on Rudy while Donovan was a negative in every advanced stat and had a 42% TS.   Same thing happened the year prior against the Rockets.  So like is Gobert ideal against an elite PnR player like Harden? Nope. But the #1 thing dragging them down was Donovan Mitchell taking 2x more shots than anyone else with a sub 45% TS.  The Jazz have been underdogs in all their recent playoff matchups and while their defensive star may only be a B in the playoffs, their offensive star is gravitating between A+ and D-."
Donovan Mitchell too
"Donovan Mitchell - has been improving each year and his latest stint was really really good, if he can stay consistent he'll reach top 10 status"
Shout out to kings fans who think fox is better than donovan mitchell
"So if that is your mindset, then any star ever who loses has a stain on their resume. I gave you his numbers, he was amazing in that series and lost. I guess Donovan Mitchell sucks too because he played great against Denver last year but lost. Huge stain on his resume."
"Wasn‚Äôt that Donovan Mitchell? Who made a shirt that basically said ‚ÄúI know Simmons had a better year, but he‚Äôs not really a rookie, I win on a technicality!‚Äù"
Donovan Mitchell at 26ppg this season is getting close to superstar status IMO
PG got bounced by a rookie Donovan Mitchell in the first round and scored 5 points on 2-16 shooting while his teammate Westbrook tried his best to carry him scoring 40+ points that game. And then the following year got sent home in 5 vs the Blazers lmao. Do I even need to mention last year?
"Maybe they need a Zion injury again :)  But they might need to get a bit lucky. Guys like Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, Devin Booker, Myles Turner, Jusuf Nurkiƒá, Clint Capela have all been picked in that range in recent years. We'll see."
loading up for Donovan Mitchell
Add Donovan Mitchell to that list and any of them would be very deserving. I'd probably go Jaylen Brown if I had any input.
"Jaylen Brown, Jrue Holiday, Donovan Mitchell, Brogdon off the top of my head."
"I'm gonna go long and say Donovan Mitchell. I think the friction between him and Gobert will flair up again if they become anything less than great, and he'll always feel like he should be the star of his own team."
"They play entirely different roles. But if you want to say that Donovan Mitchell is the worst player you can build a 60 win team with, sure."
that would mean gobert is inarguably better than donovan mitchell
"I think prime Paul Milshap on the Hawks is a good answer cause it actually happened   Pure speculation? I would say that the worst player you could build a 60 win team around is somebody on the B-list who I could then surround (realistically, not juicing) with likewise talent. I think Donovan Mitchell on the Jazz is a good example for the current NBA."
Donovan Mitchell
First Nikola Jokic Giannis Antetokounmpo Kawhi Leonard Damian Lillard Stephen Curry  Second Joel Embiid Julius Randle Jayson Tatum Luka Doncic Chris Paul  Third Rudy Gobert Zion Williamson Paul George Devin Booker Donovan Mitchell
I don‚Äôt regret passing on Donovan Mitchell for frank Ntilikina.
Kinda miss Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley
"Russ's USG% this year is actually his lowest mark since 2009-2010, and he's got a lower usage rate than other guards like:  -Luka Doncic  -Bradley Beal  -Donovan Mitchell  -Stephen Curry  -Devin Booker  -Trae Young  -John Wall  -Damian Lillard  -DeAaron Fox  -Zach Lavine  As well as front court players like:  -Joel Embiid  -Giannis Antetokounmpo  -LeBron James  -Kevin Durant  This was from a week ago so even if he's eclipsed some of these players since then, the point still stands."
"I can't believe you wasted the Ben Simmons Donovan Mitchell joke, an absolute motherfucking shame"
"I instantly scrolled down to Ben Simmons and was hoping to find it replaced by Donovan Mitchell lmao. Was rather disappointed.  I don't even have a problem with Simmons winning, I just thought it'd be funny."
"Jokic better... Embiid better..  Luka  better... Giannis better... Westbrook better... Chris Paul better..  Orange Julius better...  Dame better...  Steph better..  Booker better.. Rudy Gobert better... Kawhi better.. Kyrie better... Donovan Mitchell better.. Jimmy Butler better..      I mean, you're so confused you listed KD who is an even more injury prone. almost washed up mega star..      LMAO."
"I'll believe it when I see it, but maybe Donovan Mitchell or Devin Booker have a superstar run through the playoffs to win it all. Felt like Donovan kinda made that leap during the bubble, and with Bojan playing great and being healthy, who knows. It could be the Jazz's turn this year. This'll be Booker's first playoffs, so I'm a little less sure about him, but I hope he goes off. Both of them have veteran backcourt mates with playoffs experience in Conley and CP3, so I'm hoping for the best."
"From Hawaii, big Donovan Mitchell fan and what he stands for"
"I want to add Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell to this. THE NUGGETS DIDN‚ÄôT REALLY DRAFT THEM. We traded the pick and told them who to draft for us. So all the people saying ‚Äúnuggs could have had them all‚Äù are not at all accurate, cause the nugs never intended on picking them, that was all us."
Rose had that Garry Harris on Donovan Mitchell steal
"Ah yes, notable Lakers players, Mike Conley and Donovan Mitchell. what the fuck was mdgt\_pope getting at there?"
Unless....  -Donovan Mitchell
Khris Middleton  CJ McCollum  Karl Anthony-Towns  Kyrie Irving (people will remember him just not how great he was)  Donovan Mitchell  Nikola Vucevic  Jimmy Butler  Kyle Lowry  Ben Simmons  John Wall   Kemba Walker (might remember him for what he did in college)  Trae Young
Donovan Mitchell - Just ignore most his stats vs Houston
Paul George Kawhi Leonard John Wall Dwight Howard Al Horford Kyrie Irving / Uncle Drew  Zach Lavine Donovan Mitchell Ben Simmons  Kemba Walker
Donovan Mitchell wearing that Rookie definition sweatshirt is one of the funniest light hearted jabs i've seen in sports
"It's very easy.  Luka Doncic 8M  James Harden 40.8M  OG Anunoby 3.8M  Giannis Antetokounmpo 27.5M  Nikola Jokic 28.5M  Total 108.6M  If you mean for the whole roster, just swap out Harden with Donovan Mitchell who makes 5.2M and fill the rest in."
Donovan mitchell retweets funny videos sometimes
I think I'm the only Pacers fan in existence.  I live in Louisville though and the Donovan Mitchell connection garners a lot of Jazz fans here. Much moreso than other UofL alumni like Terry Rozier or Montrezl.
Lots of international players and Donovan Mitchell is one of one of the most liked players.
Right but Westbrook lost in the first round with Paul George and Carmelo Anthony against a rookie in Donovan Mitchell who was sitting classes 10 months in school 10 months earlier
I miss Donovan Mitchell :(
"Russ's USG% this year is actually his lowest mark since 2009-2010, and he's got a lower usage rate than other guards like:  -Luka Doncic  -Bradley Beal  -Donovan Mitchell  -Stephen Curry  -Devin Booker  -Trae Young  -John Wall  -Damian Lillard  -DeAaron Fox  -Zach Lavine  As well as front court players like:  -Joel Embiid  -Giannis Antetokounmpo  -LeBron James  -Kevin Durant  This was from 9 days ago, so maybe he's eclipsed some of these players since then but my point still stands."
"You really don‚Äôt see how the Lakers bucks Celtics Raptors etc didn‚Äôt have a huge disadvantage from bubble and how the heat benefitted from that same scenario? It‚Äôs not that hard of a concept  It‚Äôs one thing to hit huge shots in the bubble, it‚Äôs another to do it in TD Garden in game 5.   You have to atleast wonder how TJ Warren, Jamal Murray, and Donovan Mitchell etc were putting up MJ/Lebron stats in playoff games last year and maybe think the bubble has affected gameplay"
"Yeah but this is a problem in basketball discourse, most talented player isn't necessarily best player.   KD was absolutely the most talented player on those Warriors teams, but that doesn't mean he was the best player.  The best player on a team is the most important player, the one that the team can't stomach their loss or they drastically suffer in terms of W/L record, the player that impacts winning the most. There was never a point in time where DeMar DeRozan was better than Kyle Lowry despite being more talented and putting up superior stats. There was never a point in time where Blake Griffin was better than Chris Paul despite being more talented and putting up superior stats, similar story with Devin Booker this year. Donovan Mitchell is not better than Mike Conley this season, despite being more talented and putting up superior stats.   KD has never impacted wins/losses as much as his reputation has suggested he has, the reason why nobody ever talks about it, is his most glaring weakness (playmaking and creating for others on offense) has been covered up by the fact that he's played with an MVP point guard for the entirety of his career who has fulfilled that role."
Donovan Mitchell scored 50.5 points per 100 possessions last year. It was only for one round but I‚Äôm not sure what metric you used to disqualify his 2020 playoff run. I respect brons 47.5 for 3 rounds obviously a lot more but did you disqualify based on games played or points scored? I could look for other players if I know the parameters
but he did do it  the question didnt involve all these qualifiers that yall are putting  donovan mitchell literally averaged 36.3 per game last playoffs is literal facts
"I mean Curry is just obviously GOAT shooter by far but it's also a product of threes being shot way more  Like worse shooters will pass Ray Allen in fewer games as well simply because they take way more, Donovan Mitchell a 36% three point shooter will pass Ray by the time he hits like 800 games which is 500 fewer than Ray"
"i told you the last time too  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mkrnec/the_utah_jazz_have_played_every_current_playoff/gthe652/  ""The Jazz were without Donovan Mitchell in both of those games and still won fairly easily."""
"Some big talking head, can't remember the name told me Donovan Mitchell was a 3rd option, so him probably"
"What do you mean ‚Äúcovid Mavs‚Äù? You were playing your normal players in the first meeting with the Jazz. The Jazz beat the Mavs twice without Donovan Mitchell. Also in the 3rd meeting the Mavericks had their best 3 point shooting game all season hitting 23 three pointers, while the Jazz did not shoot their regular clip. Also, how is losing by 8 points clowning a team?"
According to Shaqü§°  Donovan Mitchell
Jazz are pretenders IMO. I trust CP3 and Book more than Donovan Mitchell and ....??? who?
"Skill boost: Royce Oneale, Height Boost: Donovan Mitchell, Athleticism boost: joe Ingles"
probably throw in donovan mitchell as a sweetener
"Does it have to be a current player? Clyde Drexler was insanely fast (there's also a rumor he raced and beat Carl Louis @ 200M when they were both at UH), Bill Russell gave up an olympic career (high jump but still a fast athlete) to try a NBA career. Great 100M runners tend to to be just under point guard size (5'9"" ish), so maybe Donovan Mitchell or Ja Morant. Those are stretches though. Fox is also a solid bet. Hell try Russ just because he hates losing head to head competition."
"Then write a letter to the Bus family to buy Drew Hanlen, he coaches RJ, Lavine, Tatum, Clarkson, Embiid, Beal, Zion and Hayward and has coached Randle a lil bit or Johnnie Bryant, the Knicks shooting coach who was Damian Lillard¬¥s and Donovan Mitchell¬¥s trainer since they were in college. Gonna cost a lot though, I¬¥m sure Hanlen makes at least 3 mill per year rn if not more with all the stars he¬¥s working with and Bryant is getting coaching offers from colleges left and right with how our team¬¥s shooting has improved in just one year (for example University of Utah was just after him like a month or two ago) but tbh the Lakers could use those 2 a lot.  I think the developmental side of your coaching staff needs a step up. None of your players have really taken a jump since coming to LA for a while now. Kuzma has kinda found his old self this year but that¬¥s about it and that jump could easily be just due to injuries/more minutes/getting better cuz he¬¥s getting close to his prime now."
"If you play around with the predraft combine [3/4 sprint](https://www.nba.com/stats/draft/combine-strength-agility/?sort=THREE_QUARTER_SPRINT&amp;dir=-1&amp;SeasonYear=2017-18) through different years, turns out Donovan Mitchell is really fast. 3.01 seconds and is the fastest time anyone achieved since 2005-2006 by somebody named Will Bynum. Still don't think he could or anybody in the NBA could."
"They can't win a championship because they don't have the starpower. They would not have the best player against the Lakers, Clippers, Nuggets, Sixers, Bucks, or Nets. They wouldn't even have one of the top two players against a lot of those teams. You aren't gonna Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley iso or pick and roll/hand off your way to the championship."
"That's a stupid metric. You're trying to value something based off its very peak. You could then argue that ""at their best"", Devin Booker, Chris Paul, Donovan Mitchell, Jason Tatum, hell even a Fred VanVleet type with one huge game are all comparable to AD then."
"Donovan Mitchell, by far."
"At least he got his anxiety out. He talked about when he came to Portland he was in a much more comfortable space. His first year here, he basically playing his best ball, which was great to see.    &gt;Unrelated but Donovan Mitchell only got his first start because Hood had nervous shits  Hoodie's colon died for this"
in that case they should give it to chris paul and mike conley or donovan mitchell instead of the guys on 5th and 6th seed. that'd be fine with me.
"My All NBA Team Predictions:  1st Team: G - Stephen Curry G - Luka Doncic F - Giannis Antetokounmpo F - Kawhi Leonard C - Nikola Jokic  2nd Team: G - Damian Lillard G - Chris Paul F - Julius Randle F - Paul George C - Joel Embiid  3rd Team: G - Donovan Mitchell G - Kyrie Irving F - Zion Williamson F - Jayson Tatum C - Rudy Gobert  I think most people agree with the Center positions.   I didn't include Lebron, KD, Harden because KD will only have played 50% of the games (36), Harden only 61% (44/72) or 50 games in a normal season and that's assuming he plays 2 more games, and Lebron only 65.2% (47/72) or 54 games in a normal season assuming he plays the last 4 games.  It was tough picking the guards because Booker, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, and Bradley Beal are getting shafted."
"Kinda dismissive of Mitchell, at least he‚Äôs proved himself on the playoff stage. Something Booker had not done yet. Obviously he hasn‚Äôt had the opportunity yet but to dismiss Donovan like that when Booker hasn‚Äôt proved shit is weird."
"Bron is going to make the Jazz his bitch like always. Phoenix at the very least has real stars like Booker and CP3, Jazz is basically 2015 Hawks with a borderline star in Donovan Mitchell. Gobert got destroyed by Capela so we can safely assume he ain‚Äôt gonna contribute much esp when matching up with AD. The Lakers are going to defecate on Utah and bounce them if they meet in the first round."
"Whole lotta guys that blow our minds today, there won't be room in the history books for them. Anyone really gonna talk about Jimmy Butler? He's so godlike that the nba-viewing world collectively apologized last year for not treating him like a god. It'd take a quality documentary or else I predict that whole episode gets forgotten. On the other hand, he can and should do great things post-career. I trust him more than any other NBA player to have himself a strong second half.  I'm having a hard time envisioning a future where people spend any time talking about Zach LaVine, Bradley Beal, or KAT. But they have time left to change that. Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell are currently getting themselves off that list, so it's a thing that can be done."
He‚Äôs been injury prone since his Utah days.  Unrelated but Donovan Mitchell only got his first start because Hood had nervous shits.
Donovan Mitchell in shambles
Donovan Mitchell is basically worse than Dame at everything. The only thing I can think of that he‚Äôs better at is being younger
"Kyrie and PG might be a close one. Maybe Donovan Mitchell as well, depends on the receiving team what they wanna do with their franchise."
"Butler is at a forward spot, so Mitchell couldn't fit in there. Donovan Mitchell and Trae Young are really close and I wouldn't be surprised if Mitchell made it over Trae."
And what distinguishes what he did then from what Donovan Mitchell or Luka Doncic or James Harden do now?
"I'll allow it.  I do consider Donovan Mitchell at least somewhat of a top talent tier level, but he's been out for a month-ish, and they've still trucked along to a solid record if not great record thusfar."
"I‚Äôm assuming you are asking me about Trae Young vs. Donovan Mitchell?  If so, yes‚Ä¶record means a lot. But also, Trae Young isn‚Äôt a great defender and I expect the scoring to be higher because Atl has less options"
"How about not make these selections have the potential to impact that much cash? Making a player eligible for a bigger contract due to an award is the most stupid thing the NBA has ever done.  Donovan Mitchell is a key piece for the Jazz that should be paid as much money as the Jazz can pay him, but he's NOT a Top 6 guard in the league, he might never be.   Steph, Luka, Dame, Kyrie, Beal, LaVine and some would argue CP3 and Harden (despite the missed time) should all make All-NBA before Donovan, why should that have ANY bearing on how much money he is eligible to make? It's a freaking stupid rule."
"Trae Young and Donovan Mitchell are incredibly close, however, I went with Trae Young because he puts up only 1 point less than Spida whilst also averaging almost 9.5 assists per game. This is second in the league only behind Westbrook. Trae Young is also a little bit more efficient and the Hawks have been playing really well since Nate McMillan has arrived. I could see the case tho for Donovan Mitchell, considering the Jazz have the best record in the league.  On the CP3 vote, I think Kyrie and CP3 are at the same level, however, Steph, Luka, and Dame clearly have been better than CP3 this season. Luka is carrying a Mavs team to the 5th seed with so many games by teammates missed due to protocols and injuries. Steph is the nr 2 or nr 3 MVP candidate imo, with Jokic being far ahead of the competition as nr 1. Lillard has dragged a Portland team to the 6th seed with his best teammate being out for a long time. The stats of these 3 are way better than Paul's stats. That combined with their situation and importance to their team, clearly puts those 3 ahead of CP3 for me."
"Mostly agree with OP picks, but a couple exceptions‚Ä¶   I gotta put Chris Paul on the first team because he is my pick for MVP. Also, I‚Äôd put Donovan Mitchell on the 3rd team over Trae Young."
"&gt;Roster construction doesn't determine the effort they are willing to put into the game when it's being played. THAT falls onto the head coach.  A great coach will build his system around his players, not expect to fit his players into a system.   The Jazz got very lucky with Donovan Mitchell, and to a lesser extent Rudy Gobert, but outside of that Quin Snyder has turned the Jazz into a group 10x the sum of their parts. If you track it from George Hill, to Ricky Rubio, and then Mike Conley the Jazz essentially traded 5 first round picks to finally land a fit with Conley. That leaves us filling our roster with undrafted or unwanted players. Ingles, O'Neale, Niang, Ilyasova, Forrest, Oni, are all playing great basketball and it should all be to Snyder's credit. Clarkson is playing the best basketball of his career because Snyder built a system to take advantage of his talent.  Stevens is a good coach, but he's had this golden boy status for a few years and I never felt like he deserved it. I've always been a bit jealous and salty over Steven's rep because I've always felt Snyder is a better coach and underappreciated."
"Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, Dirk Nowitzki, Damian Lillard, Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash, Amare Stoudmire, Shawn Marion, Gary Payton, Chris Paul, Nikola Jokic, Manu Ginobilli, Tony Parker, Scottie Pippen, Paul George, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Marc Gasol, Pau Gasol, Joakhim Noah, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Andrei Kirilenko, Vince Carter, Paul Pierce, Tracy McGrady...  That should be about 30 player drafted after the top 3 (which is the goal of tanking) and most of them have been late lottery picks, even some second rounder.  All these players let your franchise be a contender, or at least compete for the second round.  Sure you could nitpick on guys like Shawn Marion, AK47 or even Dray and Manu, but all these players are a product of clever drafting over mindless tanking for the first pick."
"Of course he is going to say Jokic. He/the Jazz/Donovan Mitchell hate Embiid and the Sixers. Been a rivalry for years (ROY between Simmons and Mitchell, Gobert finishing 1st in DPOY Embiid 2nd in the same year). Mitchell got heated in a game against the sixers this year and slapped the Gatorade cooler down and complained about the team at the post-game conference."
"Even if he is the same as the last 30 games next season, he played these 30 games at Donovan Mitchell level of production, at age 19! That's quite a good player."
"Gobert and Mitchell are easily top 30. I wouldn't put Clarkson, jingles, Conley or bojan better than 40th or 50th  LeBron, ad, kawhi, kd, Irving, pg13, Embiid, Jokic, doncic, harden, Curry, Dame, cp3, Booker are all above Gobert imo. Donovan probably had a case for top 12 or 13. But Conley and co to me are out of top 30"
"Now just imagine if Denver had Donovan Mitchell, too"
In an interview he said Donovan Mitchell was like a Ferrari... and he was more like a minivan.
"Right now I envision these 15:  1st: Curry, Doncic, Giannis, Embiid (if he's marked as F/C), Jokic  2nd: Chris Paul, Dame, Kawhi, Randle, Gobert  3rd: Russ, Harden, Lebron, Zion, Bam   -KD shouldn't get in since he missed half the games  -Russ is a bit of a wildcard for the last guard spot: Donovan Mitchell, Book, PG13 or Kyrie could get in instead, but I think recent performances (+records) will get Russ some votes  -Tatum could take Zion's spot: both have similar production, Zion is ridiculously efficient but Tatum is on a (much) better team that actually wins games. I think Zion has a slight advantage because of the hype/exposure, but it could change if the Celtics keep improving their standing"
Kenny brought up Donovan Mitchell as an MVP candidate during this conversation.  It infuriates me for some reason that these guy dont understand Rudy Gobert is far and away the most impactful player on the Utah Jazz.  I can understand Shaq's dumbass not knowing about it but Kenny has been brought up as a potential front office or head coach candidate.
"It is really unfortunate, it‚Äôs just one player after another. LeBron/AD aren‚Äôt fully healthy right now, Butler missed significant time, Tatum/Brown missed time, Murray is out, Donovan Mitchell got hurt, Harden and Durant dealing with injuries, LaMelo and Hayward, Pacers dealing with injuries, not to mention health and safety protocols from covid stuff. Just not a good year of basketball as a fan"
"I mean you can literally see how Melo has influenced Randle's game. He's also trained Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Cole Anthony, and so many others."
A team led by Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell is not making the finals
He is having Donovan Mitchell level stats since all star break (30 games). I think he will be as good on offense as spida is as early as next year.
"Closest to Wade is Donovan Mitchell, but Mitchell is a bit too jump-shot happy. Doesn't attack with the same ferocity as Wade. Plus as athletic as Mitchell is, Wade was still quicker before all the injuries."
Donovan Mitchell scored 26 points in a game the Jazz won because they scored more points than their opponent tonight!
Bigger Donovan Mitchell
"Heard it a ton about the nuggets ""trading away"" donovan mitchell too, super annoying"
"Basketball and soccer are the worst with player fandoms and fans/media constantly pitting one star against another. You constantly see fans of Harden and Dame hating on Steph and vice versa. Or you'll see Booker fans hating on Donovan Mitchell. Or Lebron and KD fans. No other American sports league has this type of player movement and people being fans of a single player over a team. Closest thing I've ever seen was Brady/Manning, McGwire/Sosa or Ovechkin/Crosby but at least those guys played on rival franchises"
Isn't Donovan Mitchell a good (or at least above average) defender? I'm not arguing that Gobert doesn't deserve DPOY though.
"I've decided that you aren't an NBA star until you get name checked. Donovan Mitchell? Not a star. Mo Bamba? Star. Jamal Murray? Not a star. Lou Will? Mega star because it was Drake.  Giannis hadn't truly made it until Nicki and Wayne name checked him (and Weezy didn't even use Giannis, he managed to rhyme with Antetokounmpo)"
"Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving vs Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley.  Brooklyn in 4."
"Some big names he missed:  * Russell Westbrook * James Harden (I'm calling him a point guard he's a guard with 4 seasons averaging 10+ assists and is almost always directing play fight me), Steph Curry and Jrue Holiday all in 2009 and the only player he picked was Ricky Rubio at tier 2 * On top of Kyrie 2011 also produced Kemba Walker and Isaiah Thomas * Damian Lillard * Oladipo is listed as a PG for his first season - does that count? * 2016 had Ben Simmons (kind of remarkable that around all the hype he didn't even rate him good enough to be an all-star) * 2017 continues it's oofness by also missing De'Aaron Fox (also Donovan Mitchell but I don't think he was considered a PG at the time)."
I was tossing up between DBook and Mitchell. Donovan seems quite well adjusted.
"I nominate Donovan Mitchell. Best player on the team with the best record, one of the best playoff performers in the league"
Fave: Donovan Mitchell  Least: CP3
"Yeah Luka is too large, not a good matchup for him. His work against Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker was phenomenal."
"Younger Westbrook, Rose, Wall  Zach lavine, Donovan Mitchell, maybe Fox   Malik monk, DSJ and any other recent guard dunk contest participants"
"De Aaron fox, Donovan Mitchell"
"I wouldn't say Marcus Smart making All Defense is that outlandish.  I'm gonna go off the rails and list my hot prediction takes for next season.  - 50% chance Westbrook will get traded in a blockbuster at the deadline for a 3P shooter if they're struggling during the regular season.  - The other 50% chance being the Lakers get eliminated in quarter finals again due to a combination of injuries, LeBron getting older and their lack of shooters if Westbrook doesn't get traded.  - The Bulls will make a convincing playoff run and be on the verge of eliminating a contender team in the semis, only to be reverse eliminated due to a heart breaking injury to one of DeRozan or Lavine at the worst timing possible.  - SGA will make All NBA third team.  - Kuzma will change his reputation and breakout as Washington's no 1 option. However, Washington doesn't make the playoffs.  - Klay Thompson will suffer another debilitating injury when he comes back, this time will be career threatening.  - Isaiah Thomas will be signed to a 10 day contract late in the season from a team decimated by injuries and proceed to still do nothing noteworthy.  - Jalen Suggs will emerge as the ROTY. Cade will have played better, but is ineligible due to injuries keeping him out of too many games.  - A package surrounding Ben Simmons will be eventually traded for CJ McCollum midway through the season, despite both front offices vehemently denying they're shopping either of them the entire time up to the trade.  - Donovan Mitchell will request a trade by the end of the season if the Jazz don't make it to the WCF at minimum."
"Wade also had a big frame and massive wingspan for his height. It's the same reason, 6'1 Donovan Mitchell never looks small on the court."
I mean Donovan Mitchell looks taller than 6‚Äô1. His frame makes him look bigger than he is.
Donovan Mitchell needs to be in the next poll
Donovan Mitchell average 35 5 5 against the clippers shooting 43% from 3 coming off an injury. Why don't you guys Stan him and give him his props for doing that against the clippers in 6 games?
"Bro said Donovan Mitchell, I'm fcking dead ü§£"
Donovan? I think the Jazz are a damn good team but they‚Äôre missing that one piece or real side kick for Mitchell to really put them over the hump.
Donovan Mitchell    Luka     Zion    KAT   Davion Mitchell   Embiid   Devin Booker
"He was playing pretty normal when Pat Bev wasn't on him, dramatic decreases in efficiency from 2 &amp; 3, increased turnovers, decline in assists, negative plus minus etc.   https://www.clipsnation.com/2021/6/15/22535754/la-clippers-nba-playoffs-utah-jazz-second-round-patrick-beverley-defense-donovan-mitchell"
Might be controversial but I would say Donovan Mitchell with the Jazz‚Ä¶ I just don‚Äôt see that roster making it to the finals out of the west. No matter how good of a regular season they can have.
"Ppl just conveniently ignore how bad Kyrie was when he actually had to be the first option.  Butler, Paul George, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young should all be ranked higher than him rn imo"
"Christmas day games aren't about playing the best players. They're about maximizing viewership and ad-revenue on a day where a lot of people are watch TV. Unfortunately, Jokic's game isn't the most entertaining for casual fans or sponsor's.  A non-basketball fan can be wowed by Trey, Steph, Bron, Giannis Booker, KD, Luka or Donovan Mitchell. All of those guys either have visually appealing games due to their shooting, ballhandling, or driving ability. They also all have bigger brands as well."
"To what level or playstyle of a current NBA player would you say he is? Like Donovan Mitchell and Zach Lavigne are nearly interchangeable, so who would that be for DJ?"
"He's definitely tier 1 in the regular season but yeah in the playoffs he's probably not top 10 imo. I'd rather have somebody like Donovan Mitchell, who actually elevates his game in the playoffs."
He was a shooting guard or a score-first point guard depending on how he fit into the lineup on any given night.  As for whether he could be a SG in the modern game? For sure. His style is a bit more reckless and volume heavy than what the modern game prefers but he could adjust. For his short frame he was insanely athletic. Donovan Mitchell seems like a good analogue.
Lebron Donovan Mitchell Zion AD Jokic is gonna be a real squad got dayum
"Ok so here's my breakdown: 1A) Lebron, KD, Curry, Kawhi, Giannis. Their job is to carry teams, even if they're shitty.  1B) Dame, AD, Kyrie, Harden, Embiid, Luka, Tatum, CP3 1C) Donovan Mitchell, Paul George, Brad Beal, Nikola Jokic, Jimmy Butler, Trae Young"
Well by that reasoning Donovan Mitchell is like a top 5 player right now   He‚Äôs avg 28 ppg through 33 games
PG or Donovan Mitchell!
I think a lot of people see Mitchell as a slasher and plays SG so they just bring up DWade cause it‚Äôs a similarity. No disrespect to DWade and he is HOF/ one of the top SG of all time but he was not making these shots Mitchell makes. Of course he wasn‚Äôt taking them either but he didn‚Äôt have the ability to nail the type of shots Donovan takes off the dribble from deep
aren't they? besides three point percentage they're nearly identical  |Player|G|GS|FG|FGA|FG|3P|3PA|3P|2P|2PA|2P|eFG|FT|FTA|FT|TS%|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|TOV|PF|PTS| :--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:| |Devin Booker|22|22|9.6|21.5|0.447|2|6.2|0.321|7.6|15.3|0.499|0.494|6|6.7|0.905|0.558|5.6|4.5|0.8|0.2|3.7|3.5|27.3| |Donovan Mitchell|33|33|9.9|22.6|0.436|3.6|9.2|0.394|6.3|13.5|0.465|0.516|5.5|6.4|0.862|0.567|5.1|4.6|1.3|0.3|3.3|2.5|28|
"Definitely biased but Donovan. Both have their pros and cons and I understand anyone picking either. Booker is great in the playoffs, but Playoff Mitchell is truly a sight to behold."
The last two postseasons Mitchell has elevated to a pretty all time level. Booker did good this year but Donovan has a killer's mentality and the dude just keeps improving
Current Vegas odds if anyone is interested:  2022 Regular Season MVP  Luka Doncic+400  Joel Embiid+700  Kevin Durant+700  Giannis Antetokounmpo+800  Stephen Curry+800  Damian Lillard+1200  Nikola Jokic+1500  LeBron James+1600  Devin Booker+1600  Trae Young+1800  James Harden+2000  Anthony Davis+2500  Jayson Tatum+2500  Russell Westbrook+2500  Donovan Mitchell+3000  Paul George+4000  Kyrie Irving+4000  Zion Williamson+4000
"MVP is much harder to predict now that they're awarding dudes for having a great season and not just auto picking the best player on the best team, even if that was the best choice.  Could be Luka, Giannis, Jokic, Steph, KD, Lebron, or even a wild card like Booker, Trae or Donovan Mitchell.  So hard to say!"
Donovan Mitchell or Zach Lavine are my weird picks.  The solo stars like Giannis Jokic and Steph are probably most likely tho
Do you think Donovan Mitchell is the best scorer in the NBA? Because he's averaged 34.6 ppg in the last 17 playoff games.  This sub is hilarious.
[Donovan Mitchell dropping 38](https://youtu.be/mWmftrqaKBc) to close out OKC in his Rookie season.
Honestly our same team except we have Donovan now  PG: Jamal Murray  SG: Donovan Mitchell  SF: MPJ  PF: Zeke Nnaji  C: Bol Bol
"Knicks  2016 - no picks 2017 - Donovan Mitchell, Dillon Brooks 2018 - SGA, Mitchell Robinson 2019 - RJ Barrett 2020 - Obi Toppin, Immanual Quickley  I think this has been proof of how well the Knicks FO has done in the draft. I‚Äôd still take Obi over Halliburton because in the context of this prompt we wouldn‚Äôt need him.  SGA Donovan Mitchell RJ Barrett Obi Toppin Mitchell Robinson 6th man: Quickley"
Donovan Mitchell was robbed.
"Donovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray killed the playoffs too but they didn't win a thing. The only things that matter in the GOAT conversation are the MVPs/FMVPs, the finals performance and the rings and at 26 Giannis has equal or more than MJ and Lebron."
"Well I think you can‚Äôt get too greedy and ‚Äúguarantee‚Äù. I think practically speaking guarantee means 98% chance that player, without getting hurt, can carry the team to the final 4. I don‚Äôt think you can get worse. You need to have a guy that is close to unguardable by college dudes, and the fact that Zion couldn‚Äôt do it on a duke team shows it‚Äôs not as easy as it sounds.   If you reduce it to like 90% likely I want to say guys like Donovan Mitchell, trae young, gobert. But idk if it‚Äôs a guarantee."
2016: Pascal Siakam (wound up trading 22nd pick for Marco Belinelli- Siakam picked 27th)   2017: Donovan Mitchell (picked Monk at #11)     2018: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (actually picked him at #11 but swapped for Miles Bridges for a 2nd) / Mitchell Robinson in the 2nd (we got Devonte' and it was a great pick but Mitchell Robinson works better with the new team)       2019: PJ Washington at #12 (did well here) 2020: LaMelo Ball at #3 (no complaints in hindsight)  Would've been:  Ball/Mitchell/SGA/Siakam/Robinson with PJ Washington off the bench
It‚Äôs still such a joke this clown got ROY over Donovan Mitchell.
"Kings  2016- 8th Domantas Sabonis(11th), 59th Fred VanVleet (UFA)  2017- 5th Donovan Mitchell (13th), 10th Bam Adebayo(14th), 34th Dillon Brooks (45th)  Was kind of tore between Fox and Mitchell but I picked Mitchell. If Sac doesn‚Äôt trade the 10th pick, both Mitchell and Fox would be the choice at 5 and 10.   2018- 2nd Luka Doncic (3rd), 37th Gary Trent (37th but Traded to Portland)  2019- 40th Bol Bol(44th) or Eric Paschall(41st), 47th Terrence Mann(48th), 60th Naz Reid(UFA)  2020- I‚Äôm okay with the picks from 2020 2021-Too Early to Tell"
Donovan Mitchell deserves a mention with 21 ppg and a playoff berth
sga donovan rj jaden mcdaniels mitchell robinson
They get worse by not really improving enough to convince Zion to commit his future. Say what you want about Lonzo but Zion has already said that he really liked playing with him and wanted him to stay and letting him go isn't something he's likely happy about. Zo also shot a better percentage from 3 last year than Graham if you actually wanted to go check plus Graham somehow gives you less inside the arc than Lonzo does. If you don't view Zo as even remotely important to this team then idk man. He's not a superstar or anything but he was still a key guy for them. JV is a better player than Adams but he also requires the ball to be more effective. I agree that Murphy is gonna be good but unless you think he's gonna be like a Donovan Mitchell mid-first round picks generally don't effect your team too much but he's still a great bench piece for them who might start as the year goes on.  Sure they maybe got incrementally better but is becoming a play-in team really gonna be all that exciting for them. NAW and Kira are the big ones that can really push them over the top if they pop. They do beat Memphis a lot but the Grizz have still have finished above them since Ja and Zion came innto the NBA. It's all about making your stars happy and if you think that bringing in Devonte Graham and Jonas Valncunias and becoming a play in team is gonna get Zion super psyched about being in Nola then yeah I guess they did but kinda feel like he's gonna want to be more than that.
"So, is Rozier the best Cardinal of the last ten years? Or, is that still Donovan Mitchell?"
I read this as DONOVAN Mitchell and was like‚Ä¶  How the fuck did I miss this.
"[Donovan Mitchell dropping 38](https://youtu.be/mWmftrqaKBc) to close out OKC in his Rookie season.  The game had a great buildup (Westbrook talking trash), the crowd was insane and Donovan put on a highlight reel show!"
Donovan Mitchell 57 vs Denver
"I mean it‚Äôs not a crazy thought, seems like he‚Äôs on that Donovan Mitchell trajectory, he‚Äôs performances under coach finch is night and day compared to what he was playing like under Saunders. Granted KAT was back for a lot of those games but KAT and Ant with the right pieces definitely can be a presence in the west"
Donovan Mitchell in the playoffs is legit.
Donovan Mitchell has had some crazy playoff performances.
Donovan Mitchell
"is like the bubble playoffs  donovan mitchell had stupid stats...in a first round loss, even if that series was the best out of everyone,  is equivalent to winning the mvp for great stats while missing the playoffs/negative record. even if a guy scored 50 a game how do you evaluate him vs a guy who averaged 30 in way to a ring?"
If NAW or Kira breakout then yeah but are they really gonna jump over anyone that was above them? The Spurs yeah but the Lakers and Warriors are gonna be better and the Blazers will still be a good regular season team. Maybe they're about on the level of the Grizz but I like Memphis roster more. Unless they get significantly better defensively they're likely just a play in team. Graham is a good shooter but below average on defense. I like Murphy and he looked great in Summer League but a mid-first round rookie isn't likely to change your fortunes too much unless you think he's gonna be like Donovan Mitchell.   Maybe they're slightly better than last year but they're likely just a play-in team and is that really gonna be enough to convince Zion to commit his future to NOLA?
Donovan Mitchell  Rudy Gobert  Jordan Clarkson  Royce O'neale
Yes you‚Äôre not the only one who read Donovan Mitchell at first glance.
Donovan Mitchell and Bam Adebayo are up there.
"Giannis isn‚Äôt a traditional post-up big, he‚Äôs much more of a perimeter oriented player.   And Rudy Gobert is not the reason the Jazz are on Christmas, Donovan Mitchell is."

Read this as Donovan Mitchell and was so confused.
I imagine that Mavs v Utah was meant to be Clips v Mavs. But with no Kawhi they went for Donovan Mitchell instead.  NBA is very star based when it comes to these things don't forget.
"Luka Donic, Donovan Mitchell, and Trae Young.  All 3 way more popular than Jokic."
"He never looked ""completely lost"", he was playing like Donovan Mitchell at his best for like 40 games to cap off the year"
"3x all defensive team player. Matches Jrue Holiday.  Edit: although jrue had 2 first teams while pbev only had one, but still! I know ppl are pissed at him for his behavior but he played pretty well going up against guys like Donovan Mitchell and Dbook in the playoffs"
"Not Rudy, Donovan Mitchell."
"Donovan Mitchell was the better player that series. The only game the jazz lost was the one where he didn‚Äôt play.    Besides, if all you can point to is bouncing a 9th seed in the first round round while arguably not even being the best player I don‚Äôt think that helps your case."
Which ones? At the very least I know we have 3 for gobert.    I‚Äôm willing to bet Donovan Mitchell has more 40point playoff games than playoff games lost because of him.      Obviously the plan wasn‚Äôt ‚Äútorch gobert.‚Äù Basketball is more nuanced than that.  But that is effectively what they did.  The warriors and rockets did it with lots of pick and rolls and forcing gobert to be a perimeter defender. The clippers did it buy taking advantage of his low bbiq and moving the ball around till he got confused.   So many wide open 3s where gobert was camped under the rim when he should have rotated.
3-time all defensive team and played great defense against DBook and Donovan Mitchell in the playoffs.
It is their scheme tho lol. Jazz fans used to admit to this themselves.   Besides. On top Of that for like 3-4 years in a row now the jazz have been eliminated from the playoffs and the other teams whole game plan was to torch gobert.    At the very least the clippers rockets and warriors alll did.     On top of that gobert has never really been a reason for any playoff success. Most of the series wins they have come from Donovan Mitchell heroics.
Of course.  Tony Parker didn‚Äôt play during the advanced stats centered era lol.    Besides if you look at playoff stats you‚Äôd see a different story.   Mike conley Donovan Mitchell and ingles aren‚Äôt horrible perimeter defenders lol. The jazz defensive scheme is to funnel perimeter players into gobert because that‚Äôs the only Way to really make him shine with his only real playoff caliber skill being rim protection. However he just got cooked so he didn‚Äôt really even give that either.
Then they need Donovan Mitchell and Davion Mitchell and the trifecta is complete
"I don't think either has a ton of draw, but I think the average American viewer would rather watch Donovan Mitchell than Jokic."
"Flipping Shai for Bridges and a couple seconds is a horrible trade, what are you talking about lol, that's a solid role player and two seconds for a budding superstar.    The Hayward signing was alright, idk if I'd call it a bargain unless we're turning injuries off.  He hasn't played a full season in years, and last year was more of the same.    The Kemba S&amp;T was good, I'll give them that, but I'm not giving them credit for their rookies yet before the season starts, you could've said Monk was a steal when they took him right before Donovan Mitchell before we knew how that was going to play out.    I think they've been better lately, but I still think they went in too early and aren't going to have enough high-end talent around LaMelo in the next couple years unless Bouknight turns out to be an all star caliber player."
"I think there's a chance that they make the playoffs without Mitchell because his skillset is easier for our roster to replicate, and the Jazz had a very good record last year in games that Mitchell didn't play. However, the Jazz have been abominable for years in the minutes that Gobert doesn't play.   Rudy raises our floor. Donovan raises our ceiling. We need both. It's the auxiliary pieces around them that can be moved."
"Bojan isn‚Äôt who the Jazz should be trading. They need a better secondary star beside Mitchell, and I think they only do that by trading Rudy. He‚Äôs not a playoff performer and will never play meaningful minutes for a title. He‚Äôs too much of a liability against five out offenses, which can easily be done by most playoff teams to neutralize him, and he‚Äôs not great on offense in an offensive minded NBA. Rudy could‚Äôve been an all time great with his skillset 25, maybe 30 years ago, but today he will just be known as the guy who was an anchor on a great defensive team, that went on to play horrible defense against a Clippers team without their true number one scoring option. Donovan deserves better."
"Elusive 7th pick. 7th pick only works charm for the Warriors.  13th pick. Use this pick to draft a shooting guard and you have yourself an allstar at best. Kobe Bryant, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell and Chris Duarte"
"Luka Doncic, anyone who puts him as a top 10 player is out of their mind. Takes about him being better than Harden is absolutely ridiculous. Can easily name 10 players better than him.   Donovan Mitchell,  Paul Pierce, and SGA are others I can think off"
Jamal Murray and Donovan MItchell in the bubble
"Trae is undoubtedly better than Mitchell and Booker. He‚Äôs better than CP3 too. And there‚Äôs definitely an argument for him to be better than Kyrie.   Do you understand that Trae averaged 29 and 9 in his second season and 25 and 9 this season‚Ä¶.  Those are amazing point guard numbers and he‚Äôs only 22 years old and he led his team to the ECF while beating the #1 seed and dropped 48 and 11 in game 1 against the bucks‚Ä¶   How tf are Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker better than him, Trae in his second season had numbers that they‚Äôll probably never have. Trae already eclipsed anything kyrie did in Boston as the #1 option and this is coming from a guy who loves kyrie.   Tired of the Trae disrespect, he‚Äôs definitely a top 15 player in the league rn, right behind Paul George and Tatum"
Dwade won a championship and Lebron took his team to the finals by then luka and donovan mitchell arent close
Donovan Mitchell  Zion Williamson  Karl Anthony Towns  welcome to NY
Donovan Mitchell&gt;Devin Booker. Sometimes I get crucified for saying this
"Jayson Tatum, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Chris Paul, Bradley Beal, Khris Middleton, Jaylen Brown"
"Mike Conley? Klay? Donovan Mitchell? Y‚Äôall really desperately throwing names out there and hoping it sticks. The Suns as the 2 seed faced a Lakers team that earned it‚Äôs 7 seed because of injuries, yet still had to play 4 games of AD and Lebron. Then swept the MVP who beat the healthy version of the team the Lakers beat in the first round last year. Including Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley is fucking hilarious when we beat the team that beat Mike Conley and Donovan Mitchell (2-0 without Kawhi), it‚Äôs not our fault the Jazz weren‚Äôt good enough to make the wcf"
"Zach LaVine &gt;&gt;&gt; Donovan Mitchell   Now that Mitchell hasnt really played defense in two years of playoffs in a row and is just trying to show his scoring prowess, I really think you could flip these two and Jazz do better while Bulls do worse.   Donovan is a slightly less efficient scorer with a great team around him. Zach scored with no one around him and really needs a Gobert to protect him."
This team doesn‚Äôt make the playoffs.  Donovan Mitchell is the only star
"Ja is my favorite player outside of Donovan Mitchell, dudes so fun to watch and so god damn likable!"
"Let‚Äôs name the players indisputably better than Simmons.  Lebron, AD, Embiid, Curry, Durant, Irving, Harden, Tatum‚Ä¶ oh wait that‚Äôs 8. Talk about you next time Jokic, Giannis, Middleton, Kawhi, PG13, Zion, Ja, CP3 and Book, Draymond, Donovan Mitchell, Beal, Lavine, Westbrook, Doncic, Lillard, KAT, Trae, Bam, Lowry, Butler, and Siakam. Pretty safe to say he doesn‚Äôt touch top 20. Probably not top 25 either"
"Ben Simmons isn‚Äôt a top 7 player   if the Warriors could trade Kuminga and Kuminga only for Simmons they would do it and not look back, but they can‚Äôt.   This dude is overrating the hell out of summer league, cam Thomas is probably worth Donovan Mitchell if we‚Äôre going off summer league play"
"Donovan Mitchell  Unless he works on his passing/playmaking, he ain‚Äôt going to take his team far as a first option. Past couple playoffs he‚Äôs been unable to adapt to defenses for strong playoff teams. Like, how are you unable to get the ball to a open, rolling finery and force an overhead pass to the opposite corner 3 instead?"
"No, a winning player is someone who, when they're injured or unavailable, their team performs objectively worse and when missing other key players, the winning percentage doesn't drop significantly (it's always expected that it will drop when you lose key players but to what degree?). Name a Kyrie team where that was true. You don't have to win NBA championships to be a winning player. Chris Paul is a winning player for example. DeAndre Ayton is a winning player. Jaylen Brown. Donovan Mitchell. There are plenty of them in the league. Kyrie isn't one of them.  Basketball is like the one team sport outside of being a QB where a truly exceptional player is capable of determining the outcome by themselves. This sub often acts like Kyrie is amazing and is one of those exceptional players, when he really isn't.  Like I said, it's a crazy take no one agrees with. But it's my take so I posted to answer the question."
Donovan Mitchell. I say that honestly as a Jazz fan but I'm happy to be proven wrong.
"Kawaii, Jimmy Butler, KAT, Donovan Mitchell, Kyrie Irving, and as much as it pains me Beal"
Donovan Mitchell &gt; Devin Booker
Donovan Mitchell &gt; Luka
"With injuries to LeBron, AD, Kawhi, Mike Conley, Jamal Murray, Klay, Donovan Mitchell..."
"Ben Simmons AND Donovan Mitchell are both better already than Kyrie Irving ever has been. Flashy moves that don't result in winning basketball I have never been a fan of. I truly believe Kyrie is the most overrated perennial all star of the 2010s/2020s. His winning percentage without KD Harden or LeBron is like 44%. And that includes all the games he spent on a really deep Celtics team that had a better winning percentage without him. Truly awful when your entire career has been in the East. He has proven in my eyes that he is not a winning player and never will be. Donovan Mitchell is the definition of a winning player. Simmons too despite his lazy work ethic, if he just puts in that work he could really be special."
Donovan Mitchell &gt; Devin Booker
Donovan Mitchell is way more overrated than Booker.
Donovan Mitchell and Collin Sexton have extremely similar stats.
Donovan Mitchell?
Now  1. Luka Doncic  2. Trae Young  3. Devin Booker  4. Donovan Mitchell  5. Jamal Murray  6. De‚ÄôAaron Fox  7. Ja Morant  8. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander     Ceiling  1. Luka Doncic  2. Trae Young  3. Ja Morant  4. Donovan Mitchell  5. Devin Booker  6. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  7. De‚ÄôAaron Fox  8. Jamal Murray
Donovan Mitchell
Tacko- 4 inches= Boban  Boban-4 inches= Giannis   Giannis-5 inches=Booker   Booker - 5 inches= Spida Mitchell  Donovan -4 inches = Isaiah Thomas  These are rough estimates but it puts height into perspective and I love comparing guys heights
"It‚Äôs got to be Booker. He‚Äôs an amazing player, but the man is getting massively overhyped right now Bill Simmons said on his pod today that he would take him over every other two guard (he included Harden) for next season. Not to mention the countless Kobe comps. It‚Äôs all just a little much. I would probably take Donovan Mitchell over him rn for what it‚Äôs worth."
"It's crazy that Zach Collins won MVP, DPOY and FMVP all in the same year. I'm so glad Neil Olshey picked him over that bum that Dame wanted us to draft, I think his name was Donovan Mitchell or something."
"I'm being a bit more generous because there's a lot of stars that I think ***can*** lead their team to a title, but just haven't yet.  I think after this year, Giannis would be considered a star who has the potential to lead a team to a title (even if the Bucks lose 3-4). One could also argue that guys like Devin Booker and Trae Young also showed the ability to be a #1 option on a title contender.  So my list would be like Lebron, KD, Steph, Kawhi, Giannis...but also guys who could be #1 options on a title-contender, but are currently on teams with weaker or flawed supporting casts (e.g., Luka, Dame, Embiid).  I also wonder if Donovan Mitchell and Nikola Jokic are close to that level as well (the Nuggets did lose Murray which stunted their playoff potential this year). There's also James Harden - who has made the WCF a few times but was stopped by the Warriors dynasty  Then there's guys like Jayson Tatum, who shows a ton of promise and potential - that's a future superstar IMO  Sorry - geeked out a bit. But you can see how the list quickly expands in my mind"
"* Luka Doncic * Devin Booker * SGA * Donovan Mitchell * Jamal Murray * Trae Young * Ja Morant * De'Aaron Fox  Anyone who doesn't put Luka #1 is on crack. SGA's length makes me love him for the defensive aspect of his game more than a few others, even if they're a bit better scorers. It's crazy how Fox is last cuz I think he's also great."
lmao donovan mitchell is good at one thing
donovan mitchell because jazz fans said Brioche Baynes was better than him all year
"He was talking to Donovan Mitchell while mic'd up once and it was pretty awesome. No talk of x and o's, just getting the mind right and being positive."
"They're solidly behind (with regards to the All-Star game, voted on by fans and then coaches) Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, and Damian Lillard. They're more in the Donovan Mitchell, Paul George range, which means (with regards to making the Western Conference All-Star Team) they're borderline/fringe."
"Perhaps not a superstar, but Donovan Mitchell has always come across as very humble"

"Donovan Mitchell, oddly enough."
"From what I remember, Utah draft Donovan Mitchell because he was a good defender."
"Fun fact, Donovan Mitchell was drafted as a defensive specialist"
the Gogurt stans gonna blame Donovan Mitchell for this
Simmons never develops a jumper worth shooting.   Donovan Mitchell leads the Jazz to a championship.   Zion gets a reputation as an empty stats player on a bad team.   Neither Kawhi nor PG are on the clippers.
Don‚Äôt forget as many 40 point playoff games as Donovan Mitchell in his first ever playoff run
Donovan Mitchell was getting picked up at half court and hard-doubled every time he touched the ball vs the Clippers.  It's silly to act like only a few players draw double teams.  I just think it's impressive how some teams are able to make the rest of their defense work while predictably double-teaming a star every time.
It's way more fun trying to build up with no stakes then watching Playoff P and Russ lay bricks and choke against Donovan Mitchell
and lost in 5 in the 1st round. lol getting waxed by a rookie Donovan Mitchell is good?
&gt;Teaming up with Donovan Mitchell and Jaren Jackson Jr in ~~Orlando~~ San Antonio
Teaming up with Donovan Mitchell and Jaren Jackson Jr in Orlando?
"agreed, he's a great scorer but doesn't play good defense, not a good playmaker, and gets into foul trouble too often for his position. give me donovan mitchell any day of the week  edit: some of the points i made apply to mitchell as well, but mitchell has been so much better in the playoffs and seems to have something special moreso than book"
"I think Donovan Mitchell is overrated I know everyone likes him but all of his high scoring 30/40 point games he takes like 30+ shots and is usually under 50%. He‚Äôs a gunner that doesn‚Äôt playmake well, can‚Äôt really rebound, or doesn‚Äôt defend. He just shoots a ton and scores points so everyone likes him but I think he‚Äôs kind of overrated."
"\&gt;He broke Kyrie's Cavs records for most 3pters made by a rookie.   \&gt;He broke LeBron's Cavs record of most 20 + point games as a rookie, and most consecutive 20 + point games to open a season this year.   \&gt;This past year scored 20 + pts in 48 out of 60 games played. And is one of only 5 players in the NBA with 24.0 PPG, 4.0 APG, 1.0 SPG, .470 FG%, .370 3FG% AND A .800 FT% (Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Jokic, Kyrie Irving, Stephen Curry being the others).  \&gt;Are those all tradeable mediocre players too?  &amp;#x200B;  This isn't ""statistical refutation"" as much as it's post-editing in data-picked factoids that I don't give a fuck about. You still completely refuse to cope with the reasoning as to why the franchises that owned the 22 year old versions of those players wouldn't have dreamed on not extending them, which is so much more telling about what you deep-down know to be true about Sexton's value as a player.  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt;It's almost as if they need additional pieces to help flesh out their scoring, and like they need a tandem of JAllen, Okoro, and Mobley to provide a solid defensive wall to back up their height disadvantage (and provide some great pick n roll targets).  &amp;#x200B;  If Mobley falls to them, there's probably a slight chance they extend Sexton. I still think they'd much rather re-sign Allen who can fit next to Mobley, and keep that cap space free while rolling with a Garland-Mobley facilitated offense.  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt;And you're right when have members of the sports media ever been wrong ! /  &amp;#x200B;  What does this even mean? In instances where there is this much consensus smoke, they are right very often.  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt;Cavs aint the ones trying to shoot loads of cum to hype Sexton for a trade. We just recognize what we have and can provide the stats to prove it. Which is what Ive done consistently and only gotten random opinions in response where no one has yet to explain how we replace our #1 scorer and the 25 ppg and spacing, and gritty infectious attitude, he brings w mid-level draft picks and Obi. No one.  &amp;#x200B;  You can only provide the same singular stat, PPG, and his eFG% and TS% which at least have trended towards league average for a SG that only averages about 4 3PAs a game. You ignore his tendency to ball-stop and really bad defensive fit which help contribute to a bad Net Rating and awful team relative on/off numbers. You also ignore a bad Ast/TO ratio and mediocre Ast% which is discouraging for someone who can reliably break down the defense as much as he can.  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt;But please give me more opinions I can refute with stats.  You've refuted literally none of my opinions with stats, because my collective feelings towards Sexton already acknowledge that he is developing into a nice three-level scorer capable of being a sole offensive option on a really bad team. It is his holistic package as a player that I am not very interested in.  \&gt;I got karma to burn so prove me wrong w stats or gtfo  &amp;#x200B;  ""muh downarrows"" is cringe enough without ignoring the fact that I'm the one displaying unpopular dislike for a young player that I think has been erroneously labeled as someone that meaningfully moves a team towards championship contention.  &amp;#x200B;  I don't even know why you're taking such offense to this. I'm trying to argue that your team is smart for, rumors have it, choosing not to extend Donovan Mitchell money to a potentially worse version of Donovan Mitchell and for seeing the limited value in that type of player."
I read a BR article about how a trade is possible if Blazers put on some weird glasses and think THT is Donovan Mitchell or something
1. Luka 2. Tatum 3. Jokic 4. Zion 5. Giannis  Wild card: I think Donovan Mitchell could end up taking a leap and becoming really good.
"At 10 they could have picked Donovan Mitchell or Bam, at 15 they could have taken John Collins, at 20 they could have taken Jarrett Allen or OG.  Fuck they could have gotten Kuzma at 26, at least he's still in the league.  Also could have just traded 15, 20, 26, and CJ for Paul George, that's absolutely a better looking package than Oladipo and Sabonis at that time.  Instead they got one player who has almost never played in Zach Collins and another that's already out of the league in Caleb Swanigan."
Luka/Giannis/Jokic should all be locks here then you can add 2 of Trae/Tatum/Booker/Zion/Ja/Donovan Mitchell and I wouldn‚Äôt have a problem.   Sleeper pick might be Lamelo for me.
"&gt; The second overall pick that was a huge gamble and looked horrible for most of last year?  He still has significant value and can easily be a very good player. You can't say that he doesn't have potential/trade value.  &gt; The late 20s picks are basically second rounders  you sound like every user in the BOS/BKN trade 8 years ago. It's asinine to say that they will be late 20's picks 6 years from now. Steph, Klay &amp; Draymond will be in their late 30s or retired. Dame will be old asf too. Those are valuable unprotected picks.   &gt; Pick 14 is usually a low end starter to good bench player at best  Devin Booker, Bam Adebayo, Donovan Mitchell, SGA, MPJ, Herro etc.,  GSW easily gives you the best offer."
"Hope the jazz trade Donovan Mitchell for him.   Spida, Clarkson, favors, 1st (maybe 2)?  Dame, RoCo"
"I say this as a Jazz fan. If Donovan Mitchell is being offered a spot on the Olympic team, Trae 100% deserves one too."
"The best players never go out for FIBA (no one in the USA really follows it) so it's actually rare we overcome the lack of team chemistry and win there.      If you go back and swap out Joe Harris for KD, Derrick White for Dame, a sophomore Donovan Mitchell for Devin Booker and Harrison Barnes for Draymond Green do you still think we lose in FIBA? I don't."
"ehhhh I'd consider draft day trades as being drafted by who you  end up with.  Unless you want to say Luka was drafted by the Hawks, and Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert were both drafted by Denver, etc"

"They sort of need someone like Ja, though.  Or Trae Young.  Or even Donovan Mitchell, or as Bill Simmons said, LaMelo.  Right now they don't have a real playmaker.  They have a bunch of scorers, and some ""zero guards"" (Lilliard or Jrue), but nobody that can really run the court.  This is why they might not win this year."
Tbf Donovan Mitchell has been consistently a great scorer in the playoffs
No I feel the same. I think the Donovan Mitchell comparisons are dumb. He plays much more like Dame Lillard on offense and Lou Dort on defense.
"I actually track them. If there was... I'd love it. If you check my post history, some of the odds on the bets I win are just absurd. +61500, +55000. Both those the casino workers took extra long to pay me because apparently they hadn't really seen something like that.   I track who wins the opening tip most often, what plays they like to run, take a guess at who might get the first shot... and win a very decent amount of the time. These playoffs were insane, Atlanta had won almost every single tip, as well as... Mil does, Brk did not, the LAC hadn't won a SINGLE opening tip in their 7 games vs Dallas then during most of the playoffs. I think the ended up winning one (and Marcus Morris likes to shoot early when they do). There was a period when Mil, Atl and Utah were playing that they were such locks to win the opening tip and have the first shot it was almost like betting handicapped. Because they all won the opening tips and their opponents never did. I actually still have a stack of tickets, just as proof that this stuff is able to be tracked from when those 3 series were going on. I was so sure Mil Atl &amp; Utah would win the tip and have first shot and likely score first that I put a couple hundred on a variety of combos (giannis, Donovan Mitchell, Capela) and called it out on the betting sub and was right. Nobody ended up reading my post though, and with all the combos I took... I didn't manage to put the right 3 together. I had 2 out of 3 on like 20 tickets, but just not the exact right 3.   I'm actually kind of new to this exact style of betting, I only started this year in the last half of the season and I still had half a dozen massive odds wins. 5 bucks to win 2.5k, 2 bucks to win 1.3k. I'm going to refine it and track even better next season, right from the start. And it's not a style of betting thats, as far as I can tell, even discussed mainstream. Most people still think 1st score is 100% luck but it's really not. If you put in the work, there's still luck thats needed, but you can put yourself in a much better position to succeed. I was winning such huge bets that I was spending money like a drunken idiot, bought a 500$ hoverboard, just to try and use it to walk my dog, new S21 ultra unlocked, just to help with betting. And NFL 1st scores are actually my best thing, NBA like I said I didn't start til this season. NFL I always won a few grand every year going back like 6-7 years.  You are right, Mil is a dominant team at winning the tip. Unfortunately there's only 1 series going on now, so 1st score you can only win 1 bet. I liked to parlay 3 games together and get these ridiculous odds of a dollar wins $550. It sounds kind of nuts, but like I said you can check my post history and actually see where I started, started saying I was getting closer, then started actually winning.  All I actually do is check the box scores, screenshot the play by play from the opening tip, put that in a folder for every team, then start tracking who's good at winning the tip and who's not. When 2 teams (good vs not) play each other, I take that. I also keep track of the first dozen plays that were run last time the teams played, last 5 games etc, try and find patterns. Just like how we hear all the time NFL opening drives are scripted... NBA teams don't just go out there with no plan, they like to run favorite plays to start the game too.   Not anywhere I know that tracks all this stuff except me doing it by myself."
"Mark Jackson be like   ‚ÄúAnd if I‚Äôm Devin booker, I‚Äôm a super star.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAnd if I‚Äôm trae Young, I‚Äôm a super star.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAnd if I‚Äôm Donovan Mitchell, I‚Äôm a super star.‚Äù"
"Different Era. 25ppg back then is as good if not better than 30ppg now, especially on the efficiency Dirk had. I mean, look at how many good, but not quite great guards put up ~25 ppg this season: Collin Sexton, Deaaron Fox, SGA, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young, Jaylen Brown, etc.  Those numbers were a rarity back in the day only the best of the best could reach"
Yeah Donovan Mitchell plays in a small market team yet has as many all star appearances as Gobert does in his entire career. Anyone with a brain can see that Gobert does not have a HOF impact on the floor. There‚Äôs nothing he does that‚Äôs extremely valuable to the league. Rebounding and blocking shots aren‚Äôt all that impactful in the modern era that resembles a 3 point shooting contest. That‚Äôs reflected by the number of all star appearances he has. Maybe try watching his games and see how little impact he has relative to Donovan Mitchell who‚Äôs probably not even a superstar.
"Agreed, he's so annoying to watch sometimes. A ton of talent and he's clearly great, but people/media go too far when they try comparing him to Kobe and saying he has the Mamba Mentality.  The guy does not keep his cool, he's picked fights with refs, with Jokic and with like half of that Clips team during this playoff run. People are crazy to compare him to Kobe for that reason alone lol  Give me Dame or Donovan Mitchell any day over Booker."
"Kemba Walker, Donovan Mitchell, Hamidou Diallo, Obi Toppin, Taj Gibson or Mo Bamba"
"I always find it crazy that Donovan Mitchell and Booker are the same age just because of when each of them entered the league.  My hot take on one of the threads a few years ago was that Booker would have 3 rings before he retired and everyone was like ""he's overrated"" so hopefully I'm proven right lol"
"Dude.. it‚Äôs rational to expect your top pick of the draft to be All Star.. Idgaf about the history of 2nd pick of the draft what kind of argument is that.. by that logic you should all trade your 2nd pick of the draft for the 13th pick of the draft because Kobe Bryant, Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell all drafted at 13th.."
"I think the 76ers would make an error to trade him. He's such a unique player, but he's not ""the second superstar""of a contender. More like a Super Boris Diaw.  The 76ers should try to acquire a bigger star (guard) by trading Tobias Harris and young assets, and let Simmons play a lesser role on offense (as a forward, don't let him run the whole offense on halfcourt). A role where it is ok to finish the game with 6 points.   Like, try something like Harris+Thybulle+picks for Lilliard. Or for Donovan Mitchell if he can't stand anymore to play in Utah ;-)  It's a pity that they couldn't keep Jimmy Butler.  I mean, I really like how Harris is playing this year, but he has reached his ceiling and it's probably not good enough to be the second superstar.  With less pressure, Simmons would probably do fine. Even if he misses his free throws (but he won't have the ball in his hands so often). And yes, for the 76ers it's an awful contract for this kind of role, but yeah, it's sunk cost, just live with it."
"2019 was a way worse roster than this one. The roster was Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Joe Harris, Brook Lopez, Middleton, Donovan Mitchell, Mason fucking Plumlee, Marcus Smart, Tatum, Myles Turner, Kemba, and Derrick White. Their best player at the time was Kemba. This team‚Äôs best player is Kevin Durant."

Is Donovan Mitchell getting traded y'all?
"This just isn‚Äôt true. CP3, Curry, Harden, Lilliard, Ja Morant, Jrue Holiday, Trae Young, Westbrook, Donovan Mitchell are all playmaking guards all ranked in the top 13 in assists last year. The only guys not from the US in the top 15 in assists were Luka and Ben Simmons"
"Sexton needs to be traded and this is a solid package of young players and maybe a pick. Sexton is overrated because he scores. Too small to be our 2, no court vision, doesn't make anyone better, actually pisses off the rest of the roster, has shaky handles and is predictable. In a scoring only role off the bench he'd be great. Cavs fans treat him like he's Donovan Mitchell."
"Fuck yes. Cleveland fans that think SexLand will work or Sexton &gt; Garland are crazy. Sexton would do wonders on NY and it would give some pause to his fans, but he is wrong for this Cleveland team. He isn't Donovan Mitchell."
The Miles Turner-Joe Harris-Donovan Mitchell squad that got buttfucked by France would like a word.
"Donovan Mitchell I thought was always compared and looked up to Wade?  At least Booker and JT‚Äôs play style looks good while bricking. Mitchell doesn‚Äôt have Wade‚Äôs style points or ability, and def not Kobe‚Äôs"
Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell are even bigger Kobe wannabes IMO
idk whgy this is any surprise though... aside from KD.. its the same group that lost fiba a few years ago led by pop and donovan mitchell
"-Kawhi injury  -AD Injury  -Harden injury  -LeBron age  -Kerr said he didn't want Steph overexerting himself  -Trae didn't get invited  -Donovan Mitchell injury  idk who else, but that's why for a bunch of them"
anthony davis is kinda old and already very injury prone so i wouldnt have him on this list. embiid also not due to injuries. and devin booker at number 7 when for example donovan mitchell isnt even on the list is wild too

"Yeah but Beal is performing better than Mitchell so I don‚Äôt understand your argument. If they performed the same they‚Äôd be ranked the same or whoever was on the better team would be ahead, but Beal performs better than Donovan."
If beal ever performed half as well as Mitchell has recently then everyone would be putting Beal over Donovan but it doesn‚Äôt work both ways weird
Donovan Mitchell had a player pack but I guess not a cosmetic skin.

He isn't even better than Donovan Mitchell
Donovan Mitchell or Devin Booker?
"Ok but Donovan has that Dame-like ability as a guard to drive and yam it on anyone who rotates too late. He's got both perimeter gravity and rim gravity attacking. And Mitchell defense is just better than Book's and will likely always be. I'm taking Donovan regardless of who else is on the roster, that's just me i like two way players"
"&gt; I'm pointing to individual stats to make my point  And I'll turn around and say Booker was significantly more efficient than Mitchell. I'll take that over 1 more PPG any day (not to even mention in 2020 Booker on far less USG had better efficiency AND total stats than Mitchell this year, his best statistical year)  &gt; Saying ""Devin's in the Finals and Donovan isn't"" is a terrible proof that Booker is better, considering Book has had, you know, a full contingency of All Star teammates  Who besides CP3 and Booker are all stars? And then what about Gobert? He doesn't exist all of a sudden? lol"
"I'm not slighting anyone's skill. Booker has had a tremendous postseason, tonight aside, and it's obvious that the Suns have built a team and a strategy around him that works extremely well.  The point of this conversation is to discuss whether Donovan Mitchell is a better basketball player than Devin Booker. I'm pointing to individual stats to make my point, which show that Donovan performed better than Booker did in the playoffs this year by an abundant margin. You're... saying shit like this:  &gt;But both postseasons, the Jazz crumble and lose. Is that on Mitchell? Probably not entirely. It's a team game and he's just one player.  lmao, we're going to imply Donovan Mitchell ought to be held partly accountable for the Jazz losing in the playoffs when he leads the playoffs in pts/36 one year on a bum ankle and has two 50 point games in the other - and while his team loses a crucial contributor to injury during both runs? You could just concede that you can't point to anything at all that shows Booker is a better player than Mitchell, you know. Saying ""Devin's in the Finals and Donovan isn't"" is a terrible proof that Booker is better, considering Book has had, you know, a full contingency of All Star teammates available to him through every playoff series he's played. (""But the Clippers!"" you say. Yeahh, missing 2 games of Paul vs. 5 games of Conley - when the Clippers structured their entire defense around stopping Mitchell - is not the same thing.)  Just seems like you're talking to a few other Jazz fans who have pissed you off in the past and not me. Either that, or you know damned well you're grasping at straws, so are deflecting as best you can."
Donovan Mitchell was just as bad when he was guarded by Patrick Beverley.  Doncic and Don were actively seeking screens to get off Kawhi.
"If I‚Äôm considering possible movements, regression, and injuries I have East Guards | Zach LaVine, Trae Young, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Lonzo Ball, Bradley Beal, Collin Sexton East Forwards | Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid, Kevin Durant, Jayson Tatum, Bam Adebayo East Replacements/Snubs | LaMelo Ball, Cade Cunningham, Domantas Sabonis, Jimmy Butler, Khris Middleton, Jaylen Brown, Caris LeVert, Julius Randle West Guards | Stephen Curry, Donovan Mitchell, Ja Morant, Damian Lillard, De‚ÄôAaron Fox, Devin Booker West Forwards | Nikola Jokic, LeBron James, Ben Simmons, Zion Williamson, Karl-Anthony Towns, Paul George West Replacements/Snubs | Chris Paul, D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Michael Porter Jr,  Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Brandon Ingram, Rudy Gobert  Hopefully I‚Äôm not forgetting anyone"
"Collin Sexton and Donovan Mitchell have extremely similar stats.  I‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre equal players, but I‚Äôm saying Collin is great."
-Donovan averaged a better VORP in both the regular season and playoffs  -Donovan averaged a better BPM in both the regular season and playoffs  -Donovan averaged a better WS/48 in both the regular season and playoffs  -Donovan still has the most pts/36 in the playoffs of any player - including Luka - and was better than Book in the regular season  -Donovan averaged more assists/36 in the playoffs and the regular season  The only stat that Booker is better than Mitchell in is rebounds. [See for yourself.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2021_advanced.html)
"What measure are you using to say Booker is better than Mitchell?  VORP? Mitchell's better.  BPM? Mitchell's better.  WS/48? Mitchell's better.  Hell, Donovan puts up more pts and assists per 36 than Booker, too, on almost identical USG%."
"I‚Äôm not throwing stones. My franchise sucks, but I‚Äôm not going to look at the fucking Nets and tell them some shit like they wish they had the Latvian Laser instead of Blake Griffin or something dumb. I‚Äôm telling Clips fans not to throw stones.  Also, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, didn‚Äôt he give himself the nickname about guarding Donovan Mitchell?"
"My favorite thing to look at is how similar Donovan Mitchell and Collin Sexton‚Äôs stats are.  And after I do that, I wonder why people act like Collin‚Äôs not good."
Donovan Mitchell is very good at basketball.
"Donovan Mitchell, especially this year. Shooting form is just godly to watch, such a perfect, crisp, snap of the wrist. He‚Äôs well built, can accelerate and decelerate at will, his drives are so smooth. He‚Äôs always smiling too haha"
Donovan Mitchell doesn‚Äôt though
I‚Äôve seen Donovan Mitchell make this exact pass like 15 times
"Donovan Mitchell, Derrick White, Kemba Walker, Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, Mason Plumlee, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Harrison Barnes, Marcus Smart, and Joe Harris.  Not the best team we could have sent, but they definitely should have finished better than 7th."
Definitely. That team‚Äôs best player was‚Ä¶Donovan Mitchell?
Only bullshit I see is Donovan Mitchell getting robbed of ROY! üò§üò§
Ikr? Like imagine if someone drafted Luke Kennard over Donovan Mitchell lmao. Would be a terrible decision
" Booker is definitely top 20 but out of Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, Paul George, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Karl-Anthony Towns, Donovan Mitchell, Bradley Beal, Rudy Gobert, and Chris Paul, is Booker definitely ahead of 7 of these players?"
Post ASB Ant was playing better than Donovan Mitchell
Future celtic donovan mitchell
"Ben Gordon, the spiritual bridge between Rip Hamilton and Kemba Walker, an undersized Bradley Beal with the scoring ability of a Montae Ellis Donovan Mitchell hybrid, with CJ McCollums shooting on Jamal Murray type range, would‚Äôve been the ideal pairing for a guard like prime d-rose in today‚Äôs modern NBa."
"That's why there's so many posts about Donovan Mitchell, Khris Middleton, Devin Booker and Jimmy Butler eh"
"For the Nuggets, trading our no.13 pick in the 2017 draft to Utah for Trey Lyles &amp; the no.24 pick springs to mind.  Number 13 pick would go on to be Donovan Mitchell, while Trey Lyles did nothing for the Nuggets &amp; the no.24 pick (Tyler Lydon) would do even less."
"Bit early to call but yeah, I tend to agree:   **2020**: Josh Green at 18 and left Saddiq Bey, Tyrese Maxey, Immanuel Quickley and Desmond Bane on the board.   **2019:** Dennis Smith Jr at 9 and left Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo and John Collins on the board.   Luka Doncic, Donovan Mitchell, Saddiq Bey, Kristaps Porzingis, Dwight Powell/Maxi Kleber."
"This reminds me of the back to back lottery years where the Knicks were in position to draft Donovan Mitchell and SGA  We took Ntilikina and Knox instead. Shoulda, coulda, etc. etc."

"I don't think he's making it. Steph Curry and Luka Doncic will start at the guards. The reserve spots will be Devin Booker, Chris Paul, Donovan Mitchell, &amp; Paul George.   If you consider Paul George a SF, then Anthony Edwards should fill that reserve spot.  Only way he's making it is if there are multiple injuries."
Donovan Mitchell‚Ä¶ the WC semifinals last year was a dog fight and Mitchell cooked the Clippers ‚Ä¶ but just love that guys work ethic and competitive nature. Would love to have him on our side!

And the Rockets faced rookie Donovan Mitchell and Andrew Wiggins
Donovan Mitchell
Yeah they‚Äôd both be good on the warriors for different reasons  Also I don‚Äôt know if you are joking or not but Mikal and Miles aren‚Äôt actually related. Kinda like davion and Donovan Mitchell aren‚Äôt related either
"&gt; theres like 5 guards with better defensive ratings than booker who have played 300 or more minutes but none of them have similar offensive workloads except donovan mitchell  Offense isn't a consideration for all defense though, so this is the key part. Marcus Smart shot 42/36/80 and 37/34/83 in his all defense seasons, for example."
"nobody ever talks about the suns, thats why they always post that copypasta about their winning streak  his defensive rating was 114 last year this year it's 107  theres like 10 guards with better defensive ratings than booker who have played 300 or more minutes but none of them have similar offensive workloads except donovan mitchell and maybe kyle lowry  also ayton was out for a big stretch of the early season"
"Its tough. No particular order: KD, Embiid, Giannis, Donovan Mitchell, jokic, curry, kawhi, lebron, doncic, AD.  Id say a handful are locks but you could move around mitchell, ad, tatum, trae, KAT, booker, PG, not fat zion, Harden, and more that i havent listed. But yes agreed AD definetely is not a guaranteed top 10 player with that list  Also, damn the NBA is stacked with great players lol"
Him beating both Donovan Mitchell and Damian Lillard is probably something that answers thr question if he can succeed in the post season better probably
"You clearly don't watch the games lol. Those players go off because our guards can't contain. For instance, when Gary Harris returned to the bubble to guard Donovan Mitchell, he suddenly stopped his supernova streak. When we put a good defensive guard on the other team's best guard we suddenly did great lol. Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, and Devin booker were all guarded by our 3rd stringers..."
"Donovan Mitchell, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, Devin Booker going nuts and having historically great playoff series attacking Jokic the past 2 playoffs is probably not a coincidence."
Lol even Steph is taller than Donovan Mitchell.
Got my eye on Donovan Mitchell for this one too although he has really improved those numbers yet again in the last 5 games to about 50% just like he does in the play-offs. So maybe there's still hope for him becoming an efficient scorer.
"Donovan Mitchell is having a season where he is sacrificed, his shooting splits are pretty much same, he is just less aggresive and he can't get enough free throws. His 2FG% is higher then before, 3FG% is worse. But Utah is having a nice season and some guys are playing best season of their lives."
"Then there's guys like Donovan Mitchell who caught Covid early on, and said it was milder than the common cold."

The Resurrection of Donovan Mitchell
I know he won‚Äôt ever be at their level basketball wise but Donovan Mitchell really seems like a good person.
"The last team to win the title without a superstar is who?  2014 San Antonio with Duncan at back end of his career and Kawhi at the front end of his? Perhaps, but they're considered one of the greatest teams ever with 4 all stars.  2006 Miami with Dwyane Wade and a so so Shaq? Wade was having an MVP caliber year.  Or 2004 Pistons with their formidable defense?  If you don't have a superstar you need something from these teams to go all the way and they don't have it, simply put.  Their most possible way there maybe if Donovan Mitchell has an MVP season and I don't think anybody expects that from him anytime soon."
"You know that Lillard and Donovan Mitchell, just to name a couple of scorers, are way less efficient than Davis this season, right? Most inefficient scorer my ass."
"I‚Äôve watched enough of Jordan clarkson and Donovan Mitchell chucking shots and failing to make easy passes to know what I‚Äôm looking at is not optimal. We‚Äôre not saying Mitchell isn‚Äôt extremely talented and shouldn‚Äôt be shooting/jazz would be better without him. We‚Äôre just saying he needs to take a step back sometimes and figure out when he should draw extra defenders and kick and when he should take over the offense. It‚Äôs a fine line. PG does a great job of this I feel like, one of his most underrated qualities since he‚Äôs not known as much of a playmaker."
"&gt;Donovan Mitchell: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt put this on Quin or the assistants. This is on us. We‚Äôve just got to f\*\*\*in‚Äô play better.‚Äù     That's one way to avoid your responsibility to the lose."
"Donovan Mitchell been playing like ass the last few games. Terrible FG %,  too many TOs, and not taking over down the stretch."
Of all time?  PG- John Stockton SG- Donovan Mitchell SF- Andrei Kirilenko PF- Tim Duncan C- Rudy Gobert 6th man- Joe Ingles  Current players?  PG- Ja Morant SG- Donovan Mitchell SF- Joe Ingles PF- Giannis C- Rudy Gobert
"what an incredible game, Ingram with some highly questionable decision making for the entire 4th quarter but gave it up to graham at the right time. herbert jones 20 games into his career getting the donovan mitchell assignment in crunchtime on the road in utah and handling it well is exciting stuff too      pellies showing some signs of life and zion supposedly on his way back"
Donovan Mitchell isn‚Äôt the problem. Far from it. They simply need perimeter defenders to alleviate some of Gobert‚Äôs defensive duties.
"Literally no one, the closest thing would be Donovan Mitchell or Eric Bledsoe. If you take height out of the picture Eric Paschall is a stocky dude"
"Baseball players don't require the  athleticism that a PG demands every night... let's start there . Lmao some chess players  and NASCAR drivers are probably more athletic than some MLB players   A 5-9 guy probably has a terrible wingspan and is unplayable unless he efficiently averages 20 ppg like IT  The closest comparison in the NBA would be dudes like Lowry, FVV, Felton, Donovan Mitchell,  even so, they are 6 ft +"

"r/NBA thought it would be Gobert who would be our downfall. It was Donovan Mitchell all along.   (This is an overreaction for sure, but Donovan has been horse shit lately.)"
Damian Lillard: 40/30/90  Donovan Mitchell: 42/31/87   Must be trash players too
I predict he‚Äôll put up respectable numbers as we move on.  Curry over Dame. Luka over Dame. CP3 over Dame. Ja over Dame (assuming Ja is healthy after his injury). Donovan Mitchell over Dame. Best he can do is get in the wildcard spots
Wiggs over Donovan Mitchell?  Wiggs over Ja Morant (assuming he's healthy)  Wiggs over Harrison Barnes?  Wiggs over Dejounte Murray?  Wiggs over KP?
"For the forward spot you got LeBron/AD/Draymond/PG13.  For the wildcards, Donovan Mitchell, Booker, Harrison Barnes, SGA, Fox are all up there. Its tuff."
"I mean their defense is still elite, but their two biggest offensive pieces (Mitchell and Clarkson) are ""chuckers"".  Last year the Jazz were the one seed because those shots from those guys were going down, this year both those guys are kinda in the dumps.  The Jazz will probably still be a top seed, but man watching some of their games are ugly as fuck when both Clarkson and Donovan aren't hitting."
Its Donovan Mitchell playing like complete garbage in 1/3 of the games. That's what is wrong with the Jazz.
Donovan Mitchell needs to be more consistent for the Jazz to make it far in the playoffs.
"The question isn't about who has the better career, why would you assume everyone is an idiot because you can't read?    Lavine being ""only recently a true star"" and Booker being on bad Suns teams is entirely irrelevant.  Swap Mitchell and Booker's careers out, put Donovan on those trash Suns teams, you think they are going to the playoffs?    You are acting like people asked, ""Dwight Howard, Emeka Okafor, or Greg Oden"" and everyone was saying ""Cut Howard."""
"Trae is safely top 20 but not any higher. KD, Steph, Giannis, Lebron, Jokic, Kawhi, Luka, Embiid, Dame, AD, Harden, PG, Tatum, Butler, KAT, Booker, are all clear of him then you can argue for guys like Jaylen Brown, Brad Beal, Donovan Mitchell etc."
"Donovan Mitchell is definitely a different player in the playoffs, but our system now allows for more team play than anything. Regular season, Don is probably our third most important player."
"It's crazy that at this point there's a real case for Donovan Mitchell to be the best offensive player and the worst defensive player of the 3 given their reputation when they were drafted.  I'm a bit torn, because I think Lavine is a bit better than both in the last 2 regular seasons, but he's also never been to the playoffs while we've seen both of the others there.  F it Imma go with Start Booker, Bench Lavine , Cut Mitchell"
Sure it's not Donovan Mitchell? Or u joking?
"13: Booker LaVine Kobe Malone Dale Davis   Bench: Donovan Mitchell, Richard Jefferson, Corey Maggette, Corliss Williamson  15 is still better"
It‚Äôs just surprising. It seems much easier to replace Rudy Gobert type production than it is to replace what someone like Donovan Mitchell does. I just don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs close.
"I dunno, I would say Dame off the top of my head but Id much rather go up against Dame than Donovan Mitchell in a playoff series."
"Shout out to Davion Mitchell (aka Off Night) coming in at -6.4 differential despite guarding the opponent‚Äôs #1 or #2 scorer much of the time. He‚Äôs defended Steph, Dame, Book, and Donovan Mitchel to name a few."
"I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever heard anyone say Rudy gobert is the best player on the jazz. Your take may be right though. I don‚Äôt really follow jazz basketball that closely but my first instinct is to say that Donovan Mitchell is clearly the best player on the jazz. When injured you are just that, injured."
"I think everyone's having KD, Curry, and Giannis in their Top 5 (in no particular order). I'd imagine almost everyone would keep LeBron up there, though I've heard some people argue he shouldn't be anymore. I personally think that's crap and have LeBron in my Top 5.  Then I think it starts to get messy. Jokic comes to mind and is probably who most people would put next, including me, but there might be some recency bias there.  Then you have the likes of (in no particular order) Lillard, Harden (he hasn't been having the best year, but it's been &lt; 20 games, let's not take him out of the convesation just yet), Embiid, Kawhi, AD, Paul George, and possibly the young guys (pun intended) like Luka and Trey. I think there's some reasonable argument for all of these guys to make it over Jokic, though it's stronger for some of them than others. Maybe you could add Westbrook to that list, but I'm not going to start on how I feel about him.  I'd probably say someone like Chris Paul, Donovan Mitchell, Booker, Beal is the best player in the league who **clearly** isn't a Top 5 player. I don't think anyone would put these guys in their Top 5 right now, but they're still playing at an elite level."
I would go with Donovan but I haven‚Äôt watched dame a bunch his whole career. Stat and game wise they seem similar but dame‚Äôs reluctance to get better help combined with his competition in the west the last few years has made things hard for him. Donovan Mitchell on the other hand will experience his prime after the best players/teams that dame had to compete against mostly age out of their primes. Without Mitchell getting better help relative to the west deeper into his career or continuing to play well I think it‚Äôs dame by a little bit for now but Mitchell just has so much time for power dynamics to shift and for him to be in a position to have an easier time to improve his stats and get better help which could lead to deep legacy making playoff wins. Long term my money would be on Mitchell barring injury. Regular season stats seem similar but Donovan may have better playoff stats even though it‚Äôs a smaller sample.
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."

[Donovan Mitchell will forever be haunted by Mann‚Äôs performance](https://streamable.com/n13mvp)
Can Donovan Mitchell take a game off please
"Nooo to your comps. He‚Äôs a 7ft guard. His handles are good enough, and his playmaking is ok. BUT, he can shoot, create a shot, good passer, and can protect the rim amd rebound on D.  He‚Äôs a less athletic 7ft Donovan Mitchell."
"Ok in all seriousness I don‚Äôt think he can obtain better shot selection maybe just take less. When he‚Äôs good it‚Äôs cos his jumpers wet. When he‚Äôs not he just chucking. I feel like it‚Äôs Donovan Mitchell problem. Where they really shouldn‚Äôt be taking this many shots and the ppg isn‚Äôt really reflective off their offensive arsenal , the lack of efficiency despite so many threes is. Both of them don‚Äôt have great other scorers"
Donovan Mitchell too. He had 57 in the playoffs
Davion blew me away like Donovan Mitchell in his first few games. Davion doesn‚Äôt have the same flashiness to his game but man he is one of the most solid NBA ready prospects I‚Äôve seen in a while. Very poised and he has the genetic gifts and skill to be a fixture in the league.
"The Utah Jazz will be eliminated in the first round of the playoffs this year, because Gobert is a clumsy oaf and Donovan Mitchell is overrated. Also Conley is washed and Jordan Clarkson needs to eat a fucking hamburger if he wants to be a durable off the bench scorer.   Also, nothing really gives me joy the way watching the Jazz choke does. The way that team quits on each other during the game is just \*chef's kiss\*"
"That's A reason but it's not THE reason. It's fair to wish for your team to luck into a #1 pick to instantly turn things around but let's not act like it's impossible to build a decent franchise without one.  Brooklyn was a laughing stock for giving away a generation of picks and yet (even before KD and Kyrie signed) they managed to turn the franchise around by signing a quality coach and developing a bunch of role players into a 42-40 team.  The Jazz went from a 25-57 team to a perennial contender in the west by building around Hayward, Gobert, Mitchell and Ingles, none of whom were drafted higher than 9th overall, and hiring a good coach (Snyder). They didn't have a top draft pick nor did they sign any major FAs to turn the franchise around.  The Bulls went from 11th in the east a year ago to 2nd right now by surrounding Zach LaVine (a player r/nba has clowned for not being a winner for years) with players with talent and playoff experience that other teams didn't want. Arguably they overpaid for Vucevic, DeRozan, Caruso and Ball but those overpays, along with hiring a decent coach in Billy Donovan, have taken Chicago from 22-43 two years ago to 12-6 this year.  None of those teams had a #1 pick. None of them had a LeBron choose to sign with a crap team for nostalgia. The best player on the Nets was Russell who the Lakers gave away in a salary dump. The Jazz got Hayward 9th overall. Chicago got LaVine as a consolation prize in the Butler trade after they couldn't get Wiggins.  If those teams can do it, there's no excuse for the Kings to have been consistently terrible for 16+ years."
"funny thing is; the ""Splash Brother-in-law"" transferred into Louisville to be Terry's immediate replacement.  Some guy named Donovan Mitchell joined as a freshman that year to be Terry's other successor.  Not very often does a College have 3 NBA shooting guards cycle through in a 3 year period."
It took me two seconds to google this: https://www.sportscasting.com/davion-mitchell-off-night-already-locked-up-stephen-curry-damian-lillard-donovan-mitchell-first-week-pro/ - but I also watched him enough to see both his on ball and off ball defense.

"Some that come to mind.  If you're a bigger scoring guard that can run PnR and shoot 3s you're Harden/Ginobili (especially if you're lefty). Examples: Jaden Hardy, DLo, Luka, Cade.  If you're a skilled off ball guard that can shoot you're Ray Allen/Klay/Beal and recently Lavine. Examples: Jalen Green, Buddy Hield, Malik Monk, Booker, Mclemore.  If you're an undersized but strong and long two guard who can't shoot well you're Wade. Examples: Jaden Ivey, Marcus Smart, Donovan Mitchell, Oladipo, Anthony Edwards.  If you're an explosive and fast PG, you're Rose. Examples: Wall, Fox, Morant. Maybe Westbrook, Baron Davis, and Steve Francis are other common comps.  If you're a PnR playmaking PG that can't shoot, you're Rondo. Examples: Schroeder, Kris Dunn, Elfrid Payton, Ntilikina."
"With how quickly things move in this league a ""burner pick"" can still be really dangerous for a team tho. For reference, we couldve have Donovan Mitchell right now and frank ntilikina has a 2 year residency at the Dallas Institute for Wayward Knicks"
"LeBron hasn't been a top 10 player since last year.    Steph, KD, Jokic, Harden, Giannis, Trae, Kahwi, Embiid, Luka and Donovan Mitchell are all significantly better than LeWashed.    Downvote all you want."
I swear to fucking God UofL has a curse of being unable to capitalize on great talent since the 2013 title.  Donovan Mitchell and Damion Lee were on the SAME SQUAD poised for a Final Four run at the least and we self-impose a postseason ban.  Then Nwora gets dicked out of the opportunity too.  And it goes beyond basketball. Fucking Bobby Petrino gets a chance at leading Michael Vick 2.0 through college ball and can't finish the job because of a misplaced marker at the Clemson game and wanting to put his son on the staff.
Davion*  Donovan Mitchell would be an amazing pick for the Kings lmfao
"Bulls aside, if you‚Äôre gonna come in here asking questions you don‚Äôt want the answer to:  The Jazz are pretenders because they always look elite in the regular season and then prove in the playoffs that they never had a chance at going the distance. Rudy‚Äôs defense is significantly more impactful in the regular season and Donovan Mitchell taking 30 shots a night will only take you so far."
"John Stockton. Grew up in the 90s watching him and Karl running the pick and roll. Always liked his toughness, his pass first mentally, and never taking a play off. Plus, I can always say I was there when he broke the all time steals record.  Close second is Donovan Mitchell."

"Ben for rookie Durant from the Sonics, or no deal - Morey.  Salaries might even match, just need the Sonics to invent a time machine to throw into the bargain, so we can undraft Okafor and Fultz and pick up Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell as our backcourt duo instead (sorry Seth, sacrifices had to be made).  As a compensation to Seattle, we allow them to change the timeline so Oklahoma City never steals their team as a result of how bad their roster is without Durant at that time, and share the secrets of ""The Process""."
"He was covered with five pies worth of used blueberries. The women in the audience screamed. Bossman Donovan Mitchell took one look at Jordan Clarkson and barfed on Coach Snyder.   Coach Snyder barfed on the assistant coach that was sitting next to him. Slamson barfed on his wife's tits! But when the smell hit the crowd, that's when Lukes' plan really started to work.   Girlfriends barfed on boyfriends. Kids barfed on their parents. A fat lady barfed in her purse. The Morris twins barfed on each other, and the Women's Auxiliary barfed all over the Benevolent Order of Antelopes.   And Luke just sat back and enjoyed what he'd created... a complete and total barf-o-rama!"
"IMO, similar to donovan mitchell, but several years younger."
"As of right now the Wolves don't have an allstar. LeBron and AD will both make the allstar game, even if the Lakers are barely above .500, which will take away the possible frontcourt spot KAT could get. Guard is way too freaking deep for Edwards to make it, and as you can see from this breakdown, there will be an overflow of guards into the wildcard spots, making it so the bare mininum of 6 frontcourt players make it.   **Starters**  * Stephen Curry * Luka Doncic * LeBron James * Anthony Davis * Nikola Jokic  **Reserves**  * G - Donovan Mitchell * G - Chris Paul * F - Paul George * F - Draymond Green * F - Rudy Gobert * W - Devin Booker * W - Ja Morant"
Is Donovan Mitchell not a top sg?
"But Ben being a shooter is obviously incorrect based on the numbers. His career 3pt attempt rate is .011. He‚Äôs averaged 0.0/0.1 from 3 for his career. He shot 879 of his 998 total attempts from the paint as a rookie, then  887 of his 960 the next season, then 624 of his 647 in 2020 and 552 out of his 583 in 2021.  Draymond‚Äôs tied for 55th in bpg and 70th in spg. That doesn‚Äôt mean he hasn‚Äôt been defending (very well, at that). It just means he hasn‚Äôt been racking up blocks and steals.  Similarly, there‚Äôs a difference between Tatum not passing and Tatum not getting assists. He‚Äôs been passing more than the vast majority of the league: 44.4 times a game (gets passed the ball 49 times a game) compared to, among others,  * KD: 41.4 passes a game (passed to 50.9 times a game) * Middleton: 42.6 (53.3)  * Beal: 42.1 (55.5) * Donovan Mitchell: 38.4 (57.4) * LaVine: 37.7 (49) * Ingram: 35 (50.4) * Booker: 27.5 (45.3)  And for what it‚Äôs worth, he does quite a bit better  in bballindex‚Äôs playmaking metrics than I think people would expect."
"Giannis could do it this year, so he's a lot closer than most.  Booker, the Suns are going really well at the moment. A lot would depend on how they replace Chris Paul.  Donovan Mitchell. Jazz look like they'll be a high seed in the playoffs again this year.  Trae Young. Hawks haven't started too well but they're young, and they've got good depth, so they should be there or there abouts for the next few years."
"Donovan is nowhere close to the best passer on the team.  Ingles is the best passer.  Conley is better than Mitchell too.  I am not sure who is third but the Jazz don't have great passers aside from Ingles right now.  Passes and assists are down for the Jazz this season and they play a lot of isolation compared to previous seasons (especially Donovan and Clarkson).   Donovan can make tough passes but he has poor court vision (although he does a good job of finding 3 point shooters off of penetration) and his passes are often too late.  Donovan gets a lot of assists but he also has the ball a lot.    Also steals don't indicate good defense.  Last year, he was one of the worst defenders in the NBA.  This year he is still a bad defender but maybe more active and better effort.  He can't stay in front of his man. Loses his man away from the ball due to losing focus.  Doesn't rotate well.  Too short to guard bigger players.  Probably has the ability to guard bigger point guards well due to his strength and long arms but undersized against some matchups (especially against 2s and 3s)."
Thought Donovan Mitchell was an overrated inefficient chucker.  His playoff performances made me a believer. He's the only guy on that offense.
"IMO, he probably led with Curry so as to not give away anything ""good"" for free.   To me, the real teaser is his brief mention of Maxey and the ""dangerousness"" of Donovan Mitchell."
"&gt; dangerous developments from Donovan Mitchell  Very curious to know what those are, if only I weren't too cheap"
"the clippers are just really good defensively.   ingles was flat out shut out of that series because he was the worst athlete on the floor, the Clippers have 8 guys that can guard him and they're all better athletes.    mitchell couldn't really run point like he sometimes does because his ankle was too far gone.    niang was incompetent with the ball in his hand.   the Clippers kept breaking down the offense and turning it into iso ball because we didn't have the ball-handling to run the pnr properly and get the ball to Gobert. then of course if your offense is one-legged Donovan Mitchell, Bogie and Jordan Clarkson iso-ing against a good defense the result of that is going to be a little bit up and down lol."
"Jimmy Butler has been significantly better than LeBron, given that LeBron has not played much. I would say  SF: Butler, George, Derozan, and then perhaps LeBron and Tatum  Even as a Mavs fan, I dont think I can say Luka has been the 2nd best PG.  PG: Steph, Ja Morant, Trae Young, Luka, and then I see one of CP3, Lillard, and SGA  I also don't think Harden has been the best SG. I would say that Lavine, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, and Jaylen Brown may all have had a slightly more successful season than Harden so far."
"I mean - he is a borderline top 20 player‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt get me wrong, he‚Äôs having a top 10 season so far and ranking him 82nd is ridiculous, but if you were starting a team today, for only this next season‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs borderline going top 20.   Assuming no injury no question you take Steph, Jokic, KD, Lebron, Giannis, Harden, Luka, Kawhi, Embiid, AD, Butler, and PG13 over him. That‚Äôs 12 players.   Even though he‚Äôs having a better season so far than some of the following players I‚Äôd probably take them over him too: CP3, Dame, Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, Booker, Ja, Beal, Middleton, Trae. Maybe you take DD over them, maybe not.   You‚Äôve then also got players like KAT, Bam, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, LaVine, and Lowry who it wouldn‚Äôt be crazy to pick over DD - maybe you do, maybe you don‚Äôt.   And, despite what I said on injury, I‚Äôm not even including Kyrie (who is a head case and I wouldn‚Äôt want close to my team) or Klay &amp; Jamal Murray (tbd on how they come back from injury)   So yea, I feel like borderline top 20 is very, very fair. Putting him any higher would be ridiculous."
"Yeah some amazing talent out there, Ayton being one of them also.  And Donovan Mitchell, this guy can be scary good"
Nah I don't think that will stop him much. Donovan Mitchell is an undersized scoring star on a contending team.
"This is commented a lot but I don't think it's true.  Many NBA players (both active and retired) gave him props:  * [NBA PLAYERS REACT TO GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO WINNING FINALS MVP 2021 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9yOhfBKHwM) * [NBA PLAYERS REACT TO MILWAUKEE BUCKS WINNING NBA CHAMPIONSHIP 2021 | GIANNIS REACTIONS (LeBron etc) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqGBut87sqw)  Some examples from these two videos: Lebron, Jaylen Brown, CJ, Draymond Green, Pau Gasol, Andre Iguodala, Miles Bridges, Christian Wood, Larry Nance Jr, Magic, Isiah Thomas, Donovan Mitchell, Jordan Clarkson, Ja Morant, Dejounte Murray, Covington, McGee, Haliburton, Gobert, and others."
Kinda did though. Donovan Mitchell ISO'd on Melo all series long. That doesn't happen if you replace Corey Brewer or Ferguson with Roberson
"Well, it's like how Devin Booker is the Donovan Mitchell of the NBA, you get me? Just extraordinary players."
Donovan mitchell becomes a mvp finalist after leading Utah to the best record in the west again.
"I was trying to think of a current player comp...like a beefier Donovan Mitchell? Shorter, but more athletic SGA?"
"Donovan Mitchell was there in the crowd outside the night that the Navy Seals captured Osama. He was the only one clapping/excited for them during the raid, someone threw a Blackhawk at him and missed by like two inches."
"He wanted a super team built around him, one that could carry him through the season in order to free him up for Hollywood pursuits. Bringing in great players that are at the end of their careers and often injured players to bolster the attack, absolutely no similarities to what lebron has done.   It seemed shaq had cooled out a bit on the hating after that Donovan Mitchell comment but this is all to similar to his old rhetoric of arrogance and delusion, I kinda liked the kind and funny shaq returning but it seems the other bully is back."
how can you be so sure that's its true or false? It's just a story Donovan Mitchell himself told in an ESPN interview once. How is that an indictment on sports journalism?
Saw a video where De'Aaron Fox was asked to compares himself with other speedy players like John Wall and Donovan Mitchell and he doesn't even give the other options a thought
"De'Aaron Fox, Donovan Mitchell, Zach Lavine, Anthony Edwards, Ja Morant come to my mind."
"Turns out the [""Good Job, Good Effort"" kid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lOL2h8F3aA) was Donovan Mitchell"
Donovan Mitchell was 13th pick also! End of discussion
"The heat will never beat the nets,76ers, or the bucks. You can't make your point by throwing out dumb ass insults. How old are you? 5. You know how kobe and Jordan became who they were? His work ethic is nowhere near there. I'll end the discussion on this note. Donovan Mitchell was also a 13th ovr pick!"
"Fun fact Donovan Mitchell has averaged 30+ points in as many playoff series as both Harden and Luka so maybe 30+ point series is not the best metric, especially since Luka has only played 13 playoff games."
And the year before when we picked frank instead of the hometown kid Donovan Mitchell
I mean if we‚Äôre just naming players sure. Give me Dame. Give me Embiid. Give me Donovan Mitchell  I‚Äôm sure Zion will be out of New Orleans soon but he‚Äôs going to sign that max extension first before requesting a trade. Get the bag then make the move.
"I like how you‚Äôre cherry picking  individual series out rather than complete playoff runs.   Donovan Mitchell averaged 36ppg on .696% TS. Must be the best player in the league.  Edit: my point is that Harden doesn‚Äôt consistently play like a top 3 player in the playoffs like he does during the regular season. Top 10? Absolutely, but using his regular season dominance as a reason for being under-ranked ignores the most important part of the season."
Through 4 playoff runs Donovan Mitchell averages 28.8 points   Yes his 36.3 was super impressive in 2019   I‚Äôd put Luka‚Äôs 35.7 above it because he did it while being guarded Kawhi and PG   Both more impressive from a scoring perspective than Harden‚Äôs 34.8   But I would rank Harden above Mitchell because he‚Äôs a worse 2 point shooter and playmaker
"Donovan Mitchell is basically MJ because of the Denver bubble series, y'all heard it here first.  If only ""a playoff run"" for Luka wasn't synonymous with a single series, you might be able to form a more compelling argument."
lol Donovan Mitchell is your best player
Yet Doncic isn't even the leading scorer during his own playoff career.

lol bruh any stat that has Donovan Mitchell at the top of the list is not a good measure of defensive ability. I have watched a lot of Jazz games Dmitch isn't a good defender
That‚Äôs one series. Otherwise we‚Äôd be saying that Donovan Mitchell with his 36/5/5 on 70%TS against the Nuggets and Jamal Murray with his 32/6/6 on 69%TS against the Jazz last year were better than Harden
Why isn‚Äôt Donovan Mitchell on this list?
1. Donovan Mitchell (1.3) - #27 in turnovers (2.8)  2. Jrue Holiday (1.3) ‚Äî #50 in turnovers (2.2)  3. Khyri Thomas (1.2) ‚Äî ? in turnovers (1.2) ‚Äî only played 5 games  4. Jimmy Butler (1.2) ‚Äî #51 in turnovers (2.1)  5. Russell Westbrook (1.2) ‚Äî #1 in turnovers (4.8)  6. LaMelo Ball (1.2) ‚Äî #25 in turnovers (2.8)
Just want to point out that Donovan Mitchell was 34th on the NBA turnover list last year
Right but a super team has historically been more about offense. It‚Äôs not like if you gave Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert prime draymond green that they‚Äôd be considered a super team.
"Sorry which advanced metrics? If you‚Äôre talking about raptor, last year‚Äôs top 5 offensive players were  * Full season: Curry, Jokic, Dame, Harden, Luka * Regular season only: Jokic, Steph, Dame, Harden, Luka * Playoffs only: Dame, Donovan Mitchell, Harden, Lebron, tie between Seth Curry and Luka"
"But it would take way more than Donovan Mitchell is my point. They're a contender because they got Gobert at 27th overall. For good but not great teams that draft outside the lottery it's incredibly hard to find those difference makers. There might only be 1 all-star outside the lottery in a given year and there are lots of teams picking. Well run teams find and develop those players more often than poorly run teams for sure, as a Raps fan I see that firsthand almost every year but even with all that turning the team into a Brooklyn or LA level contender is really difficult because you end up having to find a big-time talent either in the 20s or the 2nd round and some years there might not even be one. Like people shit on Portland for not building a contender around Dame without really acknowledging that it's pretty hard, they weren't some incompetent front office, they picked CJ with the highest pick they had during Dame's tenure and then it's hard to see what the path to contention was beyond what they've already experienced. I would look at Portland as an example of a small market team that was pretty well run but never got that luck that they needed. You can't expect a front office to nail every single pick no matter how good they are so barring that it's hard to see how they could have gotten there. So many things have to go right that are out of that team's control. If the Raps traded for Kawhi these days they would be giving up Siakam, OG and then probably like 4 picks and swaps, not winning because they gave up pieces and then having no future after Kawhi leaves. I'm not saying rules need to change or something this is just the reality of team building without big name free agents but I just don't like players signing long term getting all their money and then just demanding a trade. And the Zion stuff is annoying because how can you expect a team to go from drafting 1st overall to a contender in like two years. I guess my point is that you can get the Donovan Mitchell type or the Siakam type that turn your team into a playoff team but getting from there to a championship is incredibly difficult. That all-star you drafted has to be like a top 10 player which are hard to find or you have to find a similar caliber player outside the lottery. Utah is a great example. They have basically done everything right, they drafted an all star in the lottery, they found an all NBA player outside the lottery, they found an elite role player in Joe Ingles and acquired a nice complimentary piece in Mike Conley and yet here they are just a 2nd round out. That's why it's hard because you can do everything right and still not really even come that close if you don't get the opportunity to sign or trade for top players."
"I don't know. I think you can have a successful and even perfect career without winning it all at the end. Those moves by the GMs shouldn't be altered when it only was enough for the Conference Finals. It seems like you are saying that Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert were smart picks right now, but if they bring 2 championships to Utah in the next 5 years they were incredible lucky picks and I don't follow that logic."
Further evidence that Donovan Mitchell deserved Rookie of the Year
"I still believe Donovan gave Rudy covid, not the other way round. Before getting back to jazz Mitchell stayed in a town that was badly hit by covid."
"For both players it'd take a pretty major leap in skill.   For Ja probably a pull-up 3 he can hit at a decent clip on high volume ala Donovan Mitchell, for Lamelo a lot more finishing craft and strength, probably double his free throw rate. Lamelo would need to become a major weapon as a spot-up shooter, like 40% off the catch can't-leave-him open.   Both players could make up ground on Luka by using their quickness to become ballhawks and good point of attack defenders, would need to double their steal rate."
"This was the series that got me back into basketball after 15 years, I had no idea who Donovan Mitchell or Jamal Murray were at the time so it blew my mind when they started trading buckets like that"
Remember when people were picking this guy over Donovan Mitchell?
I feel like this is Donovan Mitchell.
I feel really strongly that this is Donovan Mitchell
Damn I read this Donovan Mitchell I was gonna say wtf happened
"i‚Äôve seen kat, dwight howard, KD, donovan mitchell in LA but i don‚Äôt think i said anything to them because of the setting."
"An additional wrinkle is that your rim protector is now out, away from the basket, and a smaller guy is rotating in to try and block shots, it feels like there are any number of guards that get blown by regularly, but its one thing to blow by Donovan Mitchell and then have Rudy Gobert as the help defender, its a lot easier to blow by Rudy and then have Mitchell playing help D (or Jingles/whoever rotates)."
"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters:  |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/21/2021."
gobert's dumbass shut down the NBA and jazz fans are the reason why Donovan Mitchell is gonna leave your sorry franchise
Donovan Mitchell - he was pretty much a lock last season before he got injured near the end.
"Kyrie on the jazz could win a ship. Subtract Donovan Mitchell since Mitchell is arguably better, add in a few 3-d guys and they have it."
"Bruh what? First of all, Donovan Mitchell had a way higher usage rate (38) than Clarkson (29.7) and they had two guys, Conley (22.4) and Bojan (20.2), with usage rates over 20. Also, since Clarkson wasn‚Äôt a starter he A. shouldn‚Äôt of been gassed late in games since his minutes are low and B. shouldn‚Äôt of needed to exert a ton of energy against opposing bench units which are weaker defensively.   Secondly, it wouldn‚Äôt even matter if he was their go to guy on offense since I‚Äôd make the same critic of Donovan Mitchell, who absolutely did carry their offense given all their injuries. However, even if really bad perimeter defense in the playoffs is excusable that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not a flaw of the player. Even the very best offensive superstars like Harden, Curry, and Durant have been able to be at least a neutral of defense in the playoffs, especially when it counts the most during deep playoff runs."
And yet Shaq has the audacity to call Donovan Mitchell a pudding pop
"If salary cap sees a big jump, it could lead to a situation similar to where Warriors were able to sign Kevin Durant when they normally wouldn't have been able to. Looking at players that would be entering free agency in their primes - Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, John Collins - would be the biggest beneficiaries.      Second beneficiaries are the 2021 rookie class as they become Restricted Free Agents in 2025. This might benefit teams as the cap hold for these players will be lower than normal as a percentage of cap space, so they would be able to utilize cap space first then resign RFAs using bird rights. These players include Cade Cunningham, Evan Mobley, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs.      None of these players would have incentive to sign extensions before 2025 as they can get substantially more by waiting for the new TV deal and higher salary cap.  I expect teams to maximize cap space in 2025 to increase their flexibility and target the number of free agents in this class, assuming players don't sign long term extension in anticipation of larger deals in 2025."

"Marcus Smart as borderline all star in the same category as Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Nikola Vucevic, Domantas Sabonis, Devin Booker, De‚ÄôAaron Fox, Donovan Mitchell, and Bradley Beal?  I‚Äôm sorry but yeah fucking right, okay buddy lmao  This is why you don‚Äôt just rely on analytics alone"
IMO with the exception of 2017 vs the Spurs this isn't true  Harden in general has lost to much better teams than Westbrook has lost to  Losing to the KD Warriors isn't nearly as bad as losing to rookie Donovan Mitchell and perennial first round exits Portland
"It's interesting to think about where IT, Horford and Hayward go if the trade doesn't happen. I feel like Hayward most likely re-signs with Utah because the Celtics are probably not as good a team in this alternate reality. That brings up the question of what happens to Donovan Mitchell, because he still gets drafted by the Jazz."
"You also have to take into account how many games Mitchell and Conley missed. Conley‚Äôs health is a question mark but I‚Äôm also not seeing how Mitchell will miss that many games again. And even if Bojan and Ingles decline that hard, I think the Jazz would just opt to have Donovan Mitchell take most of those shots anyway before thinking about getting Clarkson the ball.   And we also saw it in the Clippers series: Clarkson was the only bench scoring option for the Jazz when Ingles was promoted to the starting lineup for the injured Conley. That‚Äôs not really the case this time.   I don‚Äôt think Poole‚Äôs 6MOY candidacy is that likely, but Clarkson is probably not having the type of season he had last season again, at least in this year."
If Donovan Mitchell isn't the best player on the Jazz then who is? üßê
Superstar = potential #1 option on champ squad.  Superstars: Giannis &amp; Steph   All stars: Donovan Mitchell &amp; Jason Tatum   Roleplayers:  * Trae Young * Jrue Holiday * Khris Middelton * DeAndre Ayton * Karl-Anthony Towns * Julius Randle * Klay Thompson  * Booker
No love for Donovan Mitchell. He was the best player on the beat team last year.
Donovan Mitchell dropping 57 points in the first playoff game against the Nuggets last year.
Ss KD Giannis  AS Donovan Mitchell Devin Booker  The rest:  Christian Wood  Jalen Suggs  Joe Harris  Mikal Bridges  Joe Ingles  Seth Curry  Tyrese Haliburton   Jon Isaac
PG: Steph Curry  SG: Bradley Beal/Devin Booker/Donovan Mitchell (Preference)  SF: LeBron James  PF: Jayson Tatum  C: Christian Wood
"&gt; And yeah. I forget sometimes that he's just 22. And how I did dumb shit at that age.  With that being said though‚Äî Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Shai, etc. are all that young too and have their own ways of maintaining under pressure. Like 19 year old Tatum was an obvious 36 minutes per game guy and not one to get techs. I think he gets more now that he‚Äôs older, lol."
"He didn‚Äôt get carried by Westbrook, otherwise Westbrook would‚Äôve been able to make it past the 1st round against teams like rookie Donovan Mitchell Jazz and the Blazers.    OKC only lost to Klay because he had a lucky game, but even despite all of that, they lost because there was no spacing and offense &gt; defense in crunch time"
"Hayward had also proven far more than JJJ has so far, but you could argue that the Jazz have been able to assemble a better team without Hayward. Lucking into Donovan Mitchell with a pick in the teens helped, of course."
I think Donovan Mitchell comes in next season with better averages across the board.
Donovan Mitchell
Yeah not really. Mo Williams in prime &gt; unproven Booker or donovan Mitchell. People are just teenagers here.
Nba executives definitely shouldn‚Äôt use them much. Theyre not worried about who‚Äôs better between like Donovan Mitchell and Devin booker have so much film and data to analyze if a free agency decision between two guys comes up.  We fans don‚Äôt have anything better to talk about and don‚Äôt watch enough film or have access to that data
Donovan Mitchell for Karl Malone... thats very tough. I think Mitchell will be Jazz goat when its all over
"If I‚Äôm the Jazz I‚Äôm not sure I trade Donovan Mitchell for Karl Malone. I understand Malone was awesome, but Mitchell has MVP potential as well. Plus, Malone doesn‚Äôt fit with Gobert."
As a Jazz fan for this particular era I would keep Donovan Mitchell anyday.
Donovan Mitchell was supposed to be a defensive specialist.
"Giannis, Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton and Paul George/Bradley Beal/Donovan Mitchell/Klay Thompson would be favorites there dude. They would have better shooting and defense pretty handily, and could play great zone with Giannis and Brook Lopez to force shots from the nets"
Jokic outside of his passing   Donovan Mitchell   Jimmy Butler
&gt;worst injury of his career  I love how you follow this up with can't carry a team anymore. He was injured. Donovan Mitchell also got injured but that doesn't support your logic I guess.
Lebron is still a top 5 player in the league at absolute worst. Terrible take to think stopping devin booker and donovan mitchell is harder than stopping him lmao
"LeBron is old, the Lakers aren‚Äôt the team to watch  We need guys who can stop Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell now"
If somehow we had the money and assets for Donovan Mitchell
Donovan Mitchell cause I still see an alarming amount of Jazz fans and other people on here that still thinks Gobert is better than him
Donovan Mitchell for Trey Lyles says hello
Donovan Mitchell is kind of like this.
1. Jayson Tatum  2. Donovan Mitchell  3. Bam Adebayo  4. De'Aaron Fox  5. John Collins  6. Lonzo Ball  7. Jonathan Isaac  8. OG Anunoby  9. Jarrett Allen  10. Monte Morris  11. Kyle Kuzma  12. Derrick White  13. Lauri Markannen  14. Luke Kennard
I crunched the numbers but then gave a boost to JI (injuries - but eye test says DPOY) and Markkanen (Boylen - but I think he could flourish in the right situation).   1. Bam Adebayo. 2. Jayson Tatum. 3. Donovan Mitchell. 4. OG Anunoby. 5. Jonathan Isaac. 6. Lonzo Ball. 7. John Collins. 8. De'Aaron Fox. 9. Lauri Markkanen. 10. Derrick White.
[Wojnarowski] Ruby Gobert and Donovan Mitchell have requested trades from the Utah Jazz after an undisclosed event with a tour guide.
Donovan Mitchell #MarkMyWords
Donovan Mitchell went 4-22 with 1 assist and 5 turnovers against Houston game 5 in 2019. And then people blamed Rudy‚Äôs defense for losing a series in which we lost a game where Harden went 3-20.
Totally agree and would emphasize the point that players develop on different timelines. Donovan Mitchell was a late lottery pick and turned into a star in 1 season. Julius randle needed three teams and five years to figure things out and honestly situation also plays a big role. It could be multiple seasons before we have any idea how good Cade can be.
"Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker"
"Donovan Mitchell is too low. I would put him 4th ahead of Zion, Trae, and especially Simmons now."
"Speaking of Donovan Mitchell, as a Jazz fan do you think he's underrated? It's weird for a guy to put up many 40 and 50 point games in the playoffs and not be concensus top 5 or 10. That's not to say he should be considered top 5, but people seem to have him more around 20-25."
Donovan Mitchell
Never forget the people who said they would rather have Ben Simmons or Donovan Mitchell
Collin Sexton is Donovan Mitchell Lite tho
Was bout to say PG could be a sneaky one with Leonard out the year.   Donovan Mitchell putting up 26-5-5 on a 58-60 win team could garner some hype.   If Atlanta somehow steals a top 3 seed and Young averages 26-4-11 could he take it?
Homer take but I think Book has a shot. As does Donovan Mitchell.
"EPM produces some results that do not pass the eye test. I personally would not say that Fred VanVleet is the best shooting guard in the league, or that Jakob Poeltl has a more positive impact on his team that Anthony Davis or Donovan Mitchell."
MVP is so much harder to predict now when you can win that shit as a sub 4 seed.  Darkhorse I'd say is PG followed by Donovan Mitchell.
"I always find this debate interesting. If you look at it purely from a championship perspective Bam might be a better pick. The only team that's won a chip this decade with a volume scoring point guard as the focal point was the Warriors with Steph. But if you look at almost all the other championship teams there was at least one complementary wing or big that made a huge difference. The Bucks had Middleton, the Lakers had AD, the Raptors had Siakam, the Warriors had Draymond, the Spurs had Kawhi and Duncan, and the Heat had Chris Bosh.   Outside of Curry, the best players in the last several years that have consistently fit that volume scoring archetype and have consistently played for playoff teams are guys like Lillard, Harden, Kyrie, Donovan Mitchell, Westbrook, Devin Booker (I'm probably missing a few names and I might be giving Mitchell and Booker too much credit), and none of those guys except Kyrie have won a chip. All of them have been to at least a Conference Finals with the exception of Mitchell - who's never made it past the second round - which means they've been on legitimate contenders at some point. Kyrie doesn't win a championship without LeBron and while Booker probably would have won if his team had someone like Bam who could check Giannis.   That's why I find the debate so interesting if you're trying to build a championship team. In a redraft you'd probably take most of the guards I listed over the specific versions of the players I listed in the first paragraph with the exception of Davis (especially considering Bosh and Duncan weren't their most dominant selves and Kawhi wasn't expected to be as good as he's become), because you're mainly trying to raise the floor of a team, but I feel if you're trying to raise the ceiling of a team and win a championship those elite complementary pieces are more valuable than the elite scoring guards."
"Kyrie's reputation as a playoff performer is almost entirely due to the one shot in game 7.  In fact, Kyrie and PG have been two of the least clutch playoff scorers of the past decade.

"This year it‚Äôs been pretty clear that he‚Äôs our third best player.  Tbf, that's no insult. Gobert is Gobert, and Conley is playing the best basketball of his career rn.   I do think that Mitchell will be at another level well beyond current Conley by the end of the season tho. Cuz it really feels like Donovan is working through the adjustment of no longer being as big a focus of the scoring offense like he was in the bubble/ the past 3 yrs. I think that's why he had the turnover &amp; decision making issues he had to start the season.   But I think it's safe to say that Mitchell is by far the most talented player on that team, &amp; by the end of the season, he'll be shocking everyone again like he did in the Denver series."
Wow he is so overrated youd take him over Dbook? Zach Lavine is better than Donovan Mitchell. If Dbook or Lavine played with Gobert they would be seen as way better. He puts a blanket over Mitchell‚Äôs problems which makes him seem sm better than he is

Donovan Mitchell. He‚Äôs as good as guys like Zach Lavine but Mitchell gets treated by everybody like he‚Äôs the next elite pg and the face of his team. He isn‚Äôt even the face of the team and if Lavine had a guy like Gobert to cover his flaws then he would be touted higher than Mitchell

Donovan Mitchell was a rookie in one of the seasons, the next season they simply got outplayed by the better Rockets team, and last year they did not have a 20 ppg scorer in Bogdanovic. I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs so hard for people to understand the context of each playoff loss."
"That's the thing, Shamet was a huge exception.  Top 3 3PM for rookies in 17-18:  1. Donovan Mitchell  2. Kyle Kuzma  3. Lauri Markkanen  18-19:  1. Luka Doncic  2. Landry Shamet  3. Trae Young  19-20:  1. Coby White  2. Kendrick Nunn  They're all volume shooter iso players besides Shamet. 3pt specialists just don't get that many shots as rookies."
"Behind Donovan, not Conley... 23/7/6 vs 17/1/1... People really hating on Mitchell."
Donovan Mitchell played baseball.
"Yea def for basketball players. It's the reason Donovan Mitchell is so effective. He is just 6'1, but he has like a 6'10 wingspan, huge hands, weighs like 220 and a 40 inch vert. So his height is not a weakness, it is actually a strength cause of his low center of gravity. He is way more agile and quicker than bigger guards and wings. He has the same wingspan, explosiveness of a wing, but the agility and quickness of a PG."
Yeah the Jazz have the best record in the NBA and Donovan Mitchell is playing like a superstar *but does he have what it takes*
Imagine if they had a next player player instead of this bum Donovan Mitchell
Based mormon leader Donovan Mitchell
We had to play Donovan Mitchell right after Shaq said he didn‚Äôt have what it takes lol
"Steph will be number 1 for only a 5-10 seasons  Donovan Mitchell, an average 3pt shooter, already has the fastest record to 600 3pters. Dame is already up there. Trae and Luka will follow, and they‚Äôre all (but Dame) decent shooters at best.  The game is different now, these records don‚Äôt mean much. Curry will likely be the GOAT shooter for generations to come but his records are actually beatable in today‚Äôs NBA."
"You‚Äôre cherry picking.  Kennard is one of the outliers, and he was definitely underperforming  in Detroit  The lion‚Äôs share of the ‚ÄòStones (and every other toxic franchise‚Äôs) draft picks underperform, because they aren‚Äôt given the tools necessary to succeed in the NBA.  It‚Äôs really not that complicated.  When you don‚Äôt invest into player development &amp; healthy/passionate culture, your franchise will have many ‚Äúbusts‚Äù  Doesn‚Äôt matter how good a player‚Äôs base-level talent is; if the environment that there drafted into is putrid &amp; absolutely horrible like Detroit is under the Gores, 9 times out of 10 they will ‚Äúbust‚Äù  Also, calm the F down.  Talk sh!t about your city...err...wut?  What in gods name are you talking about, you lunatic üòÇü§£ü§£ do you have reading comprehension skills?  Did you not read what I typed out?  The Gores are one of the worst owners in the entire NBA, everyone knows that.  That‚Äôs why that franchise is in the gutter, because the owners could care less whether they succeed or don‚Äôt  Donovan Mitchell has achieved what he has largely because he was drafted to the freaking Jazz, a team that is consistently competitive because they have stellar ownership who adore the sport &amp; invest into the team, and one of the best coaching staffs in basketball.  Mitchell getting drafted to Detroit would‚Äôve likely lead to him underperforming   Again, this isn‚Äôt astrophysics, Copernicus.  Really not that difficult to figure out.  A 4 year old could use rudimentary deductive reasoning here &amp; come to the same conclusion, haha"
"I think this was all started when Shaq said previously that Harden don‚Äôt have what it takes. Then after the awesome game of Donovan Mitchell he sarcastically said, you don‚Äôt have what it takes, but then it became too late for him to back out on the joke or became very difficult to explain his take as spida already replied aight. He then just rolled with it and now this is the result."
"I mean, I feel like it's still fair to say he's showing flashes of being able to create his own shot. Pre-draft analysis showed that he had a very high catch and shoot 3pt percentage, but a very low dribble and shoot 3pt percentage. He's had quite a few step back threes, and even some nice stop and pops. Then he's got a pretty nice floater, especially with his long arms. I'm not saying he's a shot creator in the same vein as Donovan Mitchell or Luka. But I feel like he's shown the ability to create his own shot."
"You are right that Rubio's passing was crucial to team, and especially Donovan's success. But the reason Mitchell ended up playing heavy iso ball in those playoff series was because of Rubio's limitations. Donovan wants to play within the system and get the ball moving but when that starts failing and that team needed another way to score nobody else could provide anything. Now that we have Bogie, Clarkson, Conley and spacing, Donovan will still take isos when he is hot like his 2 50 point games against the Nuggets, but if you watched the other games in that series you'll see that with other offensive players the defense has to respect, the hero ball problems disappear and Donovan plays within the system and picks his moments.   So basically yes Rubio is a big reason Donovan was able to break out his rookie season but its also the limitations of the lineup with Rubio that forced Donovan into the hero ball.  We lost because of rebounding and perimeter defense"
Maybe there's still room for the nets to get a 3rd option like Donovan Mitchell when one of the big 3 go down
"The player isn‚Äôt really what matters, it‚Äôs player development &amp; culture.  The ‚ÄòStones have one of the worst owners in the NBA, who piggy banks the team &amp; could care less if they do well.  Donovan Mitchell &amp; Devin Booker would very likely be ‚Äúbusts‚Äù were they drafted to Detroit.  It‚Äôs the franchise, not the player, 90% of the time.  And Booker has only been thought highly of since the Suns cleaned up their act &amp; hired a real front office &amp; developmental/coaching staff, both things that the Gores will never likely do, therefore they‚Äôll keep having players ‚Äúbust‚Äù.   Utah has always had near-elite developmental &amp; Mitchell got to play under one of the best coaches in the league from day one"
I was so sure we‚Äôre would draft him.  Just like I was sure we had Donovan Mitchell but we got Luke Kennard.  And I was sure we were taking Devin Booker or Justise Winslow but we took Stanley Johnson.  Sacramento got a steal like he did in this clip
"I agree. I just have two things to add. Do you think Shaq, a player with multiple championships, played with and against some of the best this game has ever seen, and is one of the greatest players ever, has a right to say ""i don't think you have what it takes""? Sure its vague to us but maybe not so vague to Shaq.  Second thing to add: do any of you here think Donovan Mitchell has what it takes to lead a team to a Championship?"
"At half time when Shaq made the comment, Kenny had asked the panel if they though Mitchell had the ability to go from AllStar to SuperStar.  After debate and right before going to break, Ernie states that Donovan has not had more than one game with double digit Assists or Rebounds.  I think the TNT script was saying that Mitchell is 1 dimensional.    I'm guessing Shaq was tasked with running with that narrative."
"People are underrating how much winning factors into MVP. Just look at Derrick Rose‚Äôs MVP. There isn‚Äôt a scenario where Mitchell deserves MVP but if we‚Äôre 5 wins ahead of everyone outside of the bucks (because Giannis won‚Äôt threepeat) then either Donovan or Rudy winning wouldn‚Äôt be crazy, depending on who‚Äôs stats end up being better."
"I think the ‚Äúsoft hate‚Äù part is referring to Shaq, especially considering his convo with Donovan Mitchell."
"Nah man, There‚Äôs plenty of good ones now, people just use numbers and last names more, these are ones off the top of my head  Spida - Donovan Mitchell  Patient Zero, Stifle Tower, French Connection - Rudy Gobert  Minivan - Georges Niang  Juan Stockton/Spanish Samurai - Ricky Rubio  The Greek Freak  Durantula/Slim Reaper  The Brow  The Beard    Those are pretty cool"
Plus we‚Äôre the #1 rebounding team so it‚Äôs not like we need help in that department. Donovan is mostly just a scorer but it‚Äôs all we ask/need him to be. As Conley/Ingles age I‚Äôm sure Mitchell will take on more playmaking duties
Shaq is upset that Donovan Mitchell isn‚Äôt 7‚Äô1 and 300 lbs with post moves
"Inefficient College Guard  Not a plus passer  Leans on athleticism at the high school and college level that wont translate to the NBA  This has worked exactly once in recent memory. It was Donovan Mitchell and he was a defensive prospect coming out of college, not a scorer. At least Edwards has elite size for the position. Well, for the PG position, he's an average sized two guard"
"I‚Äôm pretty sure 90% of people understand that Shaq was trying to ‚ÄúTough-Love‚Äù D-Mitch into opening up his game. But the fact that ‚ÄúMan Donovan Mitchell is such a great player, but I‚Äôd like to see him expand his game in order to affect winning at a higher level‚Äù was turned into ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have what it takes to reach the next level‚Äù is a shitty way to talk to someone regardless and that‚Äôs the issue. The NBA OGs have this sense that they can just talk however they want to about the dudes in the league now and be looked at as imparting moral lessons when this was really just Shaq trying to let his nuts hang. You can acknowledge the truth of what Shaq was saying without just accepting the way he said it."
Bro you comparing rookie Donovan mitchell to fresh off an MVP Russ westbrook?
"Shaq wasn't wrong. It may have been awkward, and frankly tacky, but Donovan Mitchell shows zero signs of going to the next level. The consistency between his numbers in year 1, 2, 3 and 4 are really quite remarkable but don't offer any reason to think he has another level to him."
All Donovan Mitchell said was ‚Äúalright‚Äù.  And even Gobert said something like ‚Äúthere is no beef it‚Äôs all good‚Äù.  And then Shaq clowns him for making a bunch of money.  Who is the sensitive one?
Facts. And Shaq give me a break. Donovan Mitchell can show you things. You can't show him how to be huge. You ain't no basketball sensai. You shoot bricks.
"Shaq was tone deaf for sure. It‚Äôs about whether the clowning is mean spirited and whether it continues excessively like McGee. I love Spida. So fuck shaq for that. But who cares. Shaq gets to be a grumpy asshole  if he wants to, he‚Äôs earned that since he‚Äôs all time. You think this isn‚Äôt common in basketball circles that guys would often be supportive but sometimes super critical of these guys. Think of how much Kobe was idolized by Mitchell how would Kobe answer the question is Donovan Mitchell championship level player yet."
"russ was definitely more involved but saying mitchell was slightly better at scoring is way underselling it. mitchell's ts% that game was a full 17% higher than russ's. that's nuts.   russ is the only reason okc had a chance in that game, but donovan was the only reason utah won that game."
Am I the only one that took what Shaq said as a ‚Äúprove me wrong‚Äù type of statement? Like he actually enjoys Donovan Mitchell‚Äôs game and wants to motivate him to tap into his full potential? I didn‚Äôt take the conversation as a bad thing at all. It‚Äôs tough love. It‚Äôs not unheard of for a vet/coach/leader to do this.  Edit: When Mitchell just replied with ‚ÄúAlright‚Äù Shaq wasn‚Äôt satisfied with his answer. Then he went and said something along the lines of ‚ÄúI‚Äôll work harder and prove you wrong‚Äù then Shaq said that‚Äôs exactly what he wanted to hear.
"Shaq wanna be like : Look Donovan Mitchell is working extra hard because I challenge him on TNT...blah blah blah Stop this naive mind game, it just show how dumb you are Shaq"
"Shaq is always joking about being a champion but i don‚Äô think he 100% jokes. Maybe he really gives a player value after he wins a title. I can‚Äôt even remember the last time he was openly praising a guy who wasn‚Äôt a champion.  Maybe he goes hard on young players, especially guards, because he played with an All-Star guard who won his first title in his fourth season at age 21 and by the time he was 23, he already had a three-peat. Donovan Mitchell is 24 right now and couldn‚Äôt even go to the 2nd round.  I don‚Äôt mean to support his criticisms because not every player finds a setting where everything goes according to plan but maybe that‚Äôs how Shaq‚Äôs good/bad player mentality works."
"Kenny was kinda scrambling after what Shaq said, but he made the point in a way that was 100x better. If Shaq had said ""we can see you're a gifted scorer but you won't get to that next level without adding to your game"" at least there's an opening for Donovan to respond. Literally the only thing Mitchell could say in that situation besides cursing him out is ""okay, you're wrong."""
"Given the differences in pacing and efficiency between eras, they are way ahead of Mitchell at the same age.  Ages 21-24:  |Player|OBPM|DBPM|BPM|WS|TRB|AST|PTS|TS%| |:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Kobe Bryant|4.9|0.6|5.5|49.6|6.1|5.3|26.7|.548| |Dwyane Wade|4.0|0.9|4.9|29.9|5.0|6.1|22.9|.561| |Donovan Mitchell|1.6|-0.1|1.4|17.1|4.1|4.1|22.8|.546|  Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/psl_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 1/22/2021."
"Shaq: Don, I think you suck... you're response?   Donovan Mitchell: Aight..."
"To be fair, Shaq won titles with Kobe and DWade, so in Shaq‚Äôs experience he doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúhave what it takes‚Äù because Donovan Mitchell is not the same caliber player as Kobe and DWade."
"&gt; I completely understand why Donovan Mitchell would be taken aback by criticism from Shaq when he didn‚Äôt really have a reason for it  I honestly think Mitchell doesn't give a fuck  Wood said it best ""You're a casual""  players are in on that Shaq bullshit"
"I think Ernie and Kenny were more constructive than Shaq‚Äôs straight hating, but it wasn‚Äôt great criticism either. Mitchell doesn‚Äôt have huge assist numbers because (to my understanding) the Jazz share the ball a lot and have multiple playmakers. Besides, five assists per game is pretty good for a SG who isn‚Äôt a pure playmaker! As far as rebounding, I don‚Äôt think 6‚Äô1‚Äù Donovan Mitchell needs to be crashing the boards when they have a seven foot tall comically strong dude to do that."
"I agree. I remember when Shaq and Chuck were critical of Embiid and Embiid went out, had a big night and said they motivated him that worked because they‚Äôre big men who know his game and he has that kind of personality.   I completely understand why Donovan Mitchell would be taken aback by criticism from Shaq when he didn‚Äôt really have a reason for it. I think Chuck and Kenny were being a bit constructive because they were basically saying he needs to impact the game outside of scoring to become a superstar but Shaqs criticism came out of left field."
"Shaq is really being constructive when he calls Rudy Gobert a bum and overpaid, that's really actionable advice that he can use to improve his game. Also when he tells Donovan Mitchell that he can't take that next step and that he doesn't know who Christian Wood is. All really great, constructive criticism that totally doesn't come from a negative place.   Also, how tf is LeBron trying to make himself the victim here? This isn't about you bruh"
"It's his job to talk shit to these guys and create pointless drama. If he wasn't working for TNT, he probably wouldn't even care about Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell. It's sports entertainment."
"Approximately 75% of NBA defenders have no chance at stopping Clarkson from dribbling to exactly where he wants to go and taking exactly the shot he wants to take. And fortunately for Clarkson, the 25% of defenders who can contain him are usually busy guarding Donovan Mitchell or Mike Conley. It's a perfect situation for Clarkson and he's taking full advantage of it."
Why would he be hating on donovan mitchell? Cmon man this is just tough love
‚Äú‚ÄùAite‚Äù -Donovan Mitchell‚Äù -Michael Scott
"Yep. Clarkson has always been able to get a bucket, but he's struggled when he is the offensive focal point. Playing alongside Donovan Mitchell and a great defender in Conley, and then great spacing options like Bojan has made the game super easy for him. I hope he stays in Utah long term.   Conley appears to have finally found his groove, which if you saw him in 2019 it wasn't surprising. He just had a rough adjustment period last year in Utah."
"Like when he basically called Donovan Mitchell trash last night in their post game interview. Mitchell didn‚Äôt seem motivated at all and was basically like OK fuck you then, prompting Kenny to spend his chance to ask questions explaining the context of Shaq‚Äôs comments to, for lack of better words, save him some face. Shaq fucking sucks."
"It's not dumb.  This is some old school tough love type shit here.  And Donovan knows it.  He knows this isn't Shaq slighting him, he knows this is Shaq challenging him.    Listen this sub likes to think of Shaq as a joke and a meme.  But every single NBA player knows what Shaq did in the league, and what Shaq means for the league.  Him telling Donovan to his face that he doesn't think he has what it takes was not him saying he thinks Mitchell isn't a great player, he was telling him ""Prove me wrong.""  And hew knew that.    Shaq is an old school guy that harshly criticizes the new school game. This wasn't a dumb question.  It was a challenge.  One Donovan Mitchell accepted."
"Shaq should be fired or disciplined at the least for this. I‚Äôm not a Shaq hater at all but this is completely unprofessional in this setting.  Also, between this and when ESPN posted about Zion‚Äôs 30 piece after the Pels got beat by Utah in the first game, the Jazz have gotta be the most disrespected team of the last 10 years. And I‚Äôm a Spurs fan, I should know.  They drafted Hayward and helped turn him into a damn all star. Then he left and they got Donovan and now he‚Äôs doing the same (only better). They‚Äôve been one of the most successful teams of the last 30 years. From Stockton-Malone to DWill-Boozer, to Hayward-Gobert, and now Mitchell-Gobert"
Shaq ain't some bum youtuber who needs clickbait to pay the rent lol. his motives behind asking him that is probably because he sees Kobe Bryant potential in Donovan Mitchell and is trying to nudge him into having that killer instinct. Donovan Mitchell is probably the closest person in the NBA to having that Kobe mentality. It's not like Shaq is saying this to some bum like Andrew Wiggins who has no chance at ever being great. Everyone knows Mitchell has the potential to be an all-time great.
"Donovan Mitchell is somewhat similar, his shoes are relatively cheap &amp; good shoes for hooping, he already has 2 signature shoes with adidas"
I like Sexton but right now he is not better than Donovan Mitchell
"&gt;	Mike Conley on Shaq's interview with Donovan Mitchell: ""I don't know how you can make a statement like that regarding his progress at such a young age.""  He is literally disputing it, and calling it wrong to even do. Too bad Mike Conley has never played sports in his life"
He‚Äôs trying to motivate. Really stupid how people are spinning out about this. Does anyone on here believe Donovan Mitchell can be the best player on a championship team? Shaq just motivating and people are whining because they can‚Äôt take criticism themselves
"Individual success is not the same as team success, this brings up the issue with Goberts can‚Äôt do shit on his own has to wait for someone to throw him an alley before he can get a bucket‚Äôs dumb ass...we can look at Mitchell and Murray and say fasho they both beasts why did nuggets beat the Jazz tho second option will be jokic and gobert...jokic can do shit on his own he doesn‚Äôt need to spoon fed gobert is a great defensive player but on offensive god damn bro we can almost insert Stephen A rant on kwame in here. Please tell me what post move gobert is killing the league with if he could contribute on his own slightly instead of getting clean up buckets off the glass or from an alley oop the jazz would be a force to be reckoned with u could have a potential shaq/Kobe duo on your hand but damn no Mitchell had to put up godly performances all by himself. Shit even zydrunas ilgauskas had better moves on offense than gobert so that‚Äôs why shaq gets pissed off on goberts dumbass like yeah your a beast on defense but there‚Äôs only like 5/6 legit 7foot bigs that actually play inside instead of wanting to be 3pt shooting big and gobert is one those centers but he can‚Äôt do a single post move unlike KAT or Embiid.   Donovan will only go so far with goberts jack ass holding him back, he‚Äôs amazing on defense but he‚Äôs a damn kwame brown on offense. Goodluck in the playoffs Mitchell you won‚Äôt need the luck but your team will"
"It‚Äôs more like the TNT crew aren‚Äôt actually analysts and I feel like most people know that. They just want to mess around for the most part but the problem is they have so much access to the players lol.   It‚Äôs not like Shaq is looking to increase his popularity by saying this stuff, everyone that cares about Donovan Mitchell knows who Shaq is."
"why would they go all in on donovan like that?     like, for my context here.. i think of a superstar as someone who is like the top 3, at most top 6-7 players in the league for a few years.. those guys are superstars to me     right now to me, lebron, durant, giannis, curry, harden, kawhi.. you got some dudes who can fringe it a lot, like PG imo, he's like.. the perfect example of a fringe superstar to me     lillard is a guy i think has been a very good all star for most of his career, i don't think think he's even been as big as those guys above, but he's not a scrub or anything.. and he never got anything like donovan just got, and honestly donovan went off in the playoffs against denver last year     mitchell is like an all star quality guy right now, why is shaq going in on a young dude who's an all star? lol they're legit a top 2 team in the west right now, if you're gonna make fun of a young all star go look at doncic chilling out of the playoffs right now"
"He wasn't asking anything. He thought his opinion was gold, and he thought Donovan Mitchell needed to hear it. He thought it really mattered. That's it. Just a platter for his opinion."
"&gt;it‚Äôs ignored that Shaq said Donovan Mitchell is not a first option on a championship team, which is true.  No, Mitchell hasn't won at the first option.  But he is capable of being the first option on a championship team?  Let me put it this way - do I think Mitchell has the potential to be a Dwayne Wade type player (who was a first option on a championship team) ?  &amp;#x200B;  Absolutely."
What really amazes me is the Pelicans being 5-9 and the Jazz being top in the conference. I don‚Äôt think people talk about it enough  Pelicans have BI and Zion who are hyped so much by the fans but even when one of them scores 30 the team loses  Donovan Mitchell started off the year rough but the team was still doing their thing. Conley is back to producing and now since Donovan is back to his old ways we see that they‚Äôre doing their thing
"I felt like Shaq was trying to challenge Don to disagree with him here. Sure Shaq is an ass to big men like Gobert Dwight or even Javale McGee. Athletic bigs who aren‚Äôt great like him. Silly logic of course. But I think Shaq wanted Donovan ‚ÄúAight‚Äù Mitchell to say something like, ‚ÄúI got some things to work on but I‚Äôm going to work hard and be great.‚Äù  Shaq needs to learn he‚Äôs in the media now or build some rapport with the young NBA players"
"Even with the whole context, Shaq was being rude and clumsy.   You‚Äôre right that he wasn‚Äôt blindly hating the new gen, he probably expected Donovan Mitchell to pay him respects and work tirelessly to earn his praise. Too bad Spider doesn‚Äôt give a crap about making Shaq proud, which just makes Shaq come across as overstepping his bounds and being an ass. Also the petty Gobert stuff."
Shaq literally told Donovan Mitchell in the same exchange after he said I‚Äôm gonna keep working to get better and Shaq said that‚Äôs what I wanted to hear you say....
Shaq asks an immature question and donovan mitchell handles it with maturity
"He thinks players care about his opinion lol. He said to Donovan ""I don't think you have it in you, what do you have to say about that"". Like mitchell should care about what shaq thinks.    Mitchell had a great response, ""aight"". Like who cares about your opinion Shaq, if you think I suck, so do another a million americans. I'll get over it.   He talks smack about Chuck all the time not having any rings. Shaq is a pompous ballbuster. As much as I like him, that's just what he is."
"You mean he's too small market to get foul calls.  If Donovan Mitchell played for the Lakers with 100% the same skill level he has now, he would average 10+ FTs a game."
"Eh, I don't think he's insecure about Donovan Mitchell. There's no comparison there. I think he was trying to be, in a weird way, motivating him and probably thought Mitchell would take it better than he did.  The only time he seems insecure is when big men start getting compared to him."
"Donovan Mitchell made his 600th career 3-pointer last night.  He reached that mark in 240 games, the fastest player in NBA history to do so:  240 - Mitchell  244 - Buddy Hield  247 - Damian Lillard  248 - Klay Thompson  249 - Stephen Curry"
donovan mitchell ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
"Even when not at full force, you still have lineups that probably could end up a top 2 seed in either conference. The much maligned world cup team from last time could have a starting lineup of Kemba Walker, Donovan Mitchell, Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton, and Myles Turner with a pretty solid bench. They may not have the upper-end star power to match the elite teams, but that's a damn good lineup if given time to fully gel."
"Shaq is an insecure baby, sure, but Donovan Mitchell dropping 36 doesn‚Äôt mean much overall - he could very well still not make All Star Qual for a Western Conference Guard and it wouldn‚Äôt be undeserved. The league is that much more competitive nowadays and Shaq is a top 10 player all time. His biggest problem is him not being okay with his own, excellent legacy and feeling the need to put down other players he sees as a threat to his own career.  Shaq and Kobe were the most dominant duo the league has ever seen, I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôll ever get 2 top 10 all time players as a duo ever again.

"The Donovan Mitchell thing could of came off like he was trying to do the Kobe thing, where Kobe challenged a few players to great things, most notably Giannis to win MVP.    Shaq could of said ‚ÄúSpida you got paid, Rudy got paid, you guys have been in the playoffs but have fallen short, you currently have the second best record in the west, I challenge you to lead this team to the WCF, you up to that ?‚Äù  &amp; boom that could of been a dope moment"
I hope Donovan Mitchell can eventually have what it takes to get to the next level.
"To be fair to shaq, most nba fans, myself included, dont think donovan mitchell has what it takes to be the best player on a championship team.   Now i love spida's game, but he is not a top 10 player in my opinion  Also the way shaq phrased the question, he was clearly trying to motivate donovan mitchell. Not belittle him.  Thr shaq hate train is real these days..."
It‚Äôs not about Donovan Mitchell specifically man. I thought that was clear...
"This is ultra competitive multi-millionaire basketball, Donovan Mitchell doesn't need reddit upvotes for getting bullied."
I want to hate the Jazz so much but Donovan Mitchell is such a likable dude
"Donovan Mitchell can get to the next level easily, he was breaking records in the last playoffs. Shaq said it even tho it isn‚Äôt true, might as well say the same shit to his insecure ass."
i wouldnt be mad if he beat out donovan fucking mitchell  conley is a crucial piece to a top team
"It‚Äôs the thing that‚Äôs really bad for the league: rather than talk about how Utah‚Äôs on a 7 game win streak, playing great basketball, and how Donovan Mitchell has continued his breakout, it‚Äôs the drama that gets attention. Because the ‚Äúthis league‚Äù drama is like a drug, and the league couldn‚Äôt get enough of it"
"Donovan Mitchell is a grown man, not a 3rd grader, I‚Äôm sure that him being ‚Äúbullied‚Äù by Shaq is something you care 10x more about than Donovan himself."
"This is based on yesterday, based on the whole season it's more like  1. Gobert 2. Conley 3. Mitchell 4. Clarkson 5. O Neale so far, though Donovan and Bojan are improving."
"His defense will probably never be there, which will always hold him back, but I'd take the player Donovan was in the playoffs his first and third years over the guy Simmons has been at any point easily. Tatum has also been really good when it matters most. Not to the level of Mitchell vs the Nuggets, but never as bad as Mitchell vs the Rockets. The consistency of Tatum is what makes him better in my opinion."
"Shaq is the definition of domination when he played, whatever numbers he would put up in the regular season he would have similar monster performances in the playoffs and also propel his team to wins at that next level which is the post season not the regular season ...shaq is pretty much saying u guys are getting wins in the regular season and Donovan your putting up tremendous numbers and performances to contribute to these wins but the next level is not become a mvp or 1st team all nba player the next level is can you show success like this in the playoffs the big stage. Look at harden during his time with the rockets and let‚Äôs compare to Donovan Mitchell now, harden would put up monster performances and get his team hella Ws in the regular season all while finishing as a top seed in the west something Mitchell is on pace to do but even if Spida averages 32/10/10 and somehow won mvp that‚Äôs not the next level shaq talking about. If Donovan doesn‚Äôt produce in a similar fashion come playoff time everything he‚Äôs done in the regular season is like cool nice numbers bro but u didn‚Äôt get the job done when it mattered most in the playoffs which is the next level shaq is talking about. Shaq is rooting for Mitchell but he‚Äôs giving him tough love, shaq comes from a military background u don‚Äôt say good job your doing great in the middle of the battle you gotta see it all the way through to the end before giving someone the title of greatness or of domination. Shaq is showing love to Mitchell with this question and Donovan does respond beautifully because he‚Äôs acknowledging the challenge, not shying away aight is just a less professional way of saying sir yes sir...same way Kobe challenged giannis to become an mvp caliber player this is healthy challenge"

Quinn Snyder is one of the best coaches in the nba. They have an extensive playbook of sets to run and I think the bounce back year of mike Conley and the budding superstardom of Donovan Mitchell is the driving force. It‚Äôs nice to see him build off the bubble success as opposed to Jamal Murray not taking the step we all thought he would.
I don't think these players give a shit about Shaqs opinion nearly as much as Shaq thinks they do.. Just completely different generations. I mean when Donovan Mitchell was 11 years old Shaq was playing in Phoenix...
"I also like Donovan Mitchell, no bias at all"
"&gt;. They don't care to have him as their mentor/motivator, which he's trying to force  Which isn't true right? Guys like Embiid and Cousins, for instance, have talked about modeling their game after Shaq or have actively called him for advice. Shaq isn't forcing anything here and I think people want to *pretend* he's irrelevant because they don't like him.   &gt;What else is Mitchell going to say when he is put on the spot like that  This is always a silly comment. There are players who have actively taken offense to Shaq's comments and have let him know it. Donovan could have stopped after the first ""alright"", if he wasn't feeling it. Donovan isn't a child, he's been playing competitive sports his entire life. Teammates and coaches say things like that to players all the time. I'd suggest you go back to watch interviews from those old lakers teams.   &gt;I didn't get those vibes from Mitchell. He was caught off guard at first. Shaq made it awkward as fuck. Even at the end when Mitchell was taking off the headset, his body language was like, ""Okay? What the fuck was that?""  This is projection"
"I don't think I really agree. While it's certainly possible have both, the vast majority of dudes at the top do so with athletic prowess. Not to say it means dudes are dumb, but I think the vast majority of the top players in the league are of average mental capacity at best. In my experience, the greatest sports minds are often role players. Some notable exceptions off the top of my head are CJ McCollum, Kobe, Donovan Mitchell, Chris Bosh, Kevin Love, Mike Conley, and I'm sure there's more but again, I'd argue they're the exception, not the rule."

To think we passed up on Donovan Mitchell for him.  It‚Äôs like the gift that keeps on giving.
"no one gets rudy gobert as a rookie, except donovan mitchell"
"Even if you wanted to make the argument that Mitchell is a better player than Gobert, I think Rudy would still be more valuable for us just because the role he plays is so unique. If we don't have Donovan it can be rough but we have other scorers and ball handlers. If we don't have Rudy our entire defensive scheme falls apart and we lose a lot on offense too from his screens to the gravity on the pnr. Rudy doesn't do everything, but the things he can do he does so damn well."
"Jaylen Brown, Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell. Those 3 were super active and are always working with the community. There are def more but those 3 are the first to come to mind"
It what world are Brandon Ingram and Donovan Mitchell on the same level? I don't think anything thinks Ingram is better than Simmons. Mitchell is definitely better.
Donovan Mitchell is worse
Donovan Mitchell said you guys won don‚Äôt worry
"There are roughly 10 teams that could win this year, so your first options are Joel Embiid, Kevin Durant, Giannis, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Lebron, Kawhi, and Jokic.  Mitchell is easily the worst of the bunch."
Easily Donovan Mitchell.
Donovan Mitchell for sure.
I wonder if Donovan Mitchell is going to cry about the officiating and how small market teams like the Celtics don't get any calls
"Respect yeah I made that get confusing, lol I edited it but I like the choice, personally I think Donovan Mitchell needs some more love"
Donovan Mitchell is so tough
"&gt;Dray isn't a net positive on offense  That's not even close to accurate. Dude isn't averaging 9apg by being bad at offense, he's doing it by blowing up 4 on 3s whenever Curry draws doubles, as he has for years. That's why Kerr is so diligent about keeping them on the floor together (even moreso then his defense). GSW as a whole and Curry's own splits with/without Draymond back this up, going back several years.  &gt;oubre and wiggins do get staggered.  Oubre plays more than 80% of his minutes with Curry. Contrast with players like Kyle Lowry and Donovan Mitchell, or to a lesser extent Anthony Davis and CJ McCollum, who all played somewhere from 55% to 68% of their minutes with their team's top player this year or last year -- that's what staggering looks like. No wonder Curry's on/offs look better than LeBron's or Dame's when their 2nd best player is on the court most of the time they're off of it, while Curry plays with his best teammates 96% and 81% of the time."
"I'm not your buddy, guy. Lol I'm just saying, clearly Donovan Mitchell is good at basketball or he wouldn't be viewed the way he is. And yeah, I agree Conley and DeMar should have made it, even over Booker. I think Mitchell and Booker are similar. They mostly just score, they're there to take the tough shots. They aren't the ones running their team's offenses and their teams are better for it, in the regular season. However, there's a reason you need those guys when thebplayoffs start and it's harder for a Mike Conley to shoulder the scoring load game to game."
"Clarkson and Mitchell are both small shot creators. They're not as good at running a good old fashioned offense as Conley is. Donovan is the best guard because he's there to take the hardest shots in isolation. That's the most valuable skill to have, and the reason why primary scorers are considered the best players most of the time. Clarkson does the same job as Mitchell does, so they have skill overlap as iso scorers and thus reduce each other's value on the court. Net rating isn't the end all be all because it ignores the context. Conley's been great, I'm not taking anything from him. I'm just saying Mitchell's value isn't gonna show up in those numbers."
"As a completely unbiased Philadelphia 76ers fan who has love for every and all teams, I‚Äôll have to say Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics (:  (But truthfully I‚Äôd say Donovan Mitchell or Murray cuz they were awesome in that playoff series in front of lots of viewers but right now aren‚Äôt those same players and haven‚Äôt been usually. Maybe they will be but so far those games are the exception not the rule)"
Either Jayson Tatum or Donovan Mitchell
Donovan Mitchell is so overrated
Donovan Mitchell for MVP? Lol.
"The Celtics 2 best players are top 3 picks, the Pelicans have 2 all-star caliber players who were both top 3 picks, 1 on their own accord and 1 through trading AD (yeah it‚Äôs called rebuilding, do your Googles), Donovan Mitchell was a lottery pick, Devin Booker was a lottery pick, Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons were lottery picks, Bam Adebayo was a lottery pick."
Did people not see Donovan Mitchell almost single handedly best is a couple weeks back?
Then how come Donovan Mitchell isn‚Äôt in the DPOY conversation with Gobert backing him up as a rim protector?   Lmfao that‚Äôs a weak take. You can appreciate Ben‚Äôs defense suffocation while acknowledging he has a great defensive big behind him. He‚Äôs so talented the offense stops before it makes it to Embiid.  Find a new slant
"Butler, Donovan Mitchell, Dame"
"When Donovan Mitchell did this, everybody here said he was a pussy"
Donovan Mitchell was right
"""In my mind we won that game"" - Julius ""Donovan Mitchell"" Randle"
"LeBron, Steph Curry, Donovan Mitchell"
"Simons/Melo/Kanter is without a doubt the worst defensive trio in the league.  You could put prime KG &amp; Ron Artest with them and they'd still give up points hand over fist.  It is unreal to me that Olshey gets such a pass from the fanbase, he's incredibly high variance so his good moves (drafting Dame &amp; CJ, the Nurkic trade) seem to outshine so much of the crushing whiffs he's also had (giving Evan Turner, Allen Crabbe, Moe Harkless and Meyers Leonard $200M in one summer, trading up to draft Zach Collins instead of Donovan Mitchell/Bam/OG/John Collins, drafting Simons without a clear path to development/reps).  Granted building a title team in Portland is incredibly difficult, but the way he seems to escape all accountability is crazy to me."
"&gt; perennial all-star but with very few all NBA teams  That's just how it works out sometimes. Paul Pierce had 10 All-Star/4 All-NBA. Vince Carter had 8/2, Ray Allen had 10/2.   He might make it this year, but he's not a sure thing. Harden, Curry, Dame, Luka, Ben Simmons are all likely. He's in the mix with players like Beal, Lavine, Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Jaylen Brown. Russ won't make it this year, so that frees up a spot."
"Worth noting too, alot of rookies come in shooting in the lower 40s. Wiggins and lavine came in shooting low 40s as well on the same team. Donovan Mitchell, Bradley beal also came in shooting low 40s, Mitchell still does and Beal took a few seasons to get figure it out/improve. Does that mean edwards will figure it out? No, if he does i won't be shocked, we've seen it before.   I personally would only be concerned if we didn't see an upward trend."
"Steph Curry, LeBron, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young"
"Jazz are in the prime of their window and are pretty scary.  They're also really fun to watch, well-coached and full of smart/good players.  Their ball movement looks like Spurs/Warriors-style beautiful game for long stretches.       Honestly, biggest potential vulnerability for Utah is how dependent they are on Donovan Mitchell playing well.  He's amazing, but still has stretches where he looks like he's still figuring out how to manage the game from the PG position, with some mildly questionable decision-making."
Reminds me of Donovan Mitchell
"LeBron is the MVP man deal with it. Jazz guys aren't having MVP level stats. Donovan Mitchell is averaging like 23-24 PPG.... Are you that naive.  Stop blowing smoke up Jokic's ass. Let him prove he can get a top record first, he hasn't shown the ability to. LeBron is the MVP and it's killing you inside lol. Typical LeBron haters, the most unoriginal thing lol."
Bigger than Donovan Mitchell
Good gawd this man is a mix of Derrick rose and Dwayne wade but bigger than Donovan Mitchell.  https://twitter.com/danemoorenba/status/1371286801902604301?s=21  He was chirping Melo hard tonight. This kids confidence is astronomical.  Verbatim what I said lol.
"Honestly I don‚Äôt really remember summer league standouts that well. The only ones I remember recently are Donovan Mitchell, kuz, and herro"
Good gawd this man is a mix of Derrick rose and Dwayne wade but bigger than Donovan Mitchell.
He‚Äôs definitely been playing well this year and hitting a lot of threes but he‚Äôs just a good role player. Nothing to complain about but he‚Äôs no Donovan Mitchell
"He may never be Donovan Mitchell, but he has been really good for y‚Äôall lately, has he not?"
Malik Monk. I was so glad we got him instead of Donovan Mitchell because all my friends really liked Donovan Mitchell but I thought Malik would be better. Smh
The Donovan Mitchell comparisons are starting to really look true. Very similar play styles/shooting tendencies. Big difference is that Edwards is so much bigger. If he can get his passing up to par with Donovan‚Äôs he‚Äôll be multi time all star
"Mitchell has been awful during this stretch. I'm sure he'll turn it around and have another hot streak...but this is the Donovan Mitchell experience. He's a coinflip player with lots of ups and downs. As a Jazz fan I pray that he gets hot in the playoffs...but at the end of the day he just isn't that reliable of a player and when things aren't going well for him, he can really drag the team down."
The easy comp is Donovan Mitchell even down to the inefficiency to some degree. Mitchell came out as a Sophomore while Ant re-classified up a class and came out the same age as current college freshman.   It‚Äôs not hard to see Ant at D Mitchell rookie year levels in 2 years. Play styles are almost identical.
"No he isn‚Äôt. Add Donovan Mitchell in too. All these guys can be 1st options on a winning team maybe aside from Gobert, Simmons can‚Äôt."
"We replace Donovan Mitchell with Shai, Lavine, Booker, Beal, Luka, Ingram, etc and the Jazz are still #1 record. Those players are better than Mitchell."
"Most of this comment thread was about Shai being the better scorer. I slipped up in my mind.  Either way, watching them play and looking at stats it‚Äôs clear Shai is a better scorer and playmaker than Donovan. Additionally, Donovan isn‚Äôt even better than Shai on defense.  Team success does count for something, and that is why Mitchell is still a good player."
"humor me for a second.  - Donovan Mitchell is probably on a similar level to Jimmy in terms of impact since he‚Äôs Utah‚Äôs main offensive star but Jimmy has been playing better  - Booker and CP3 kill each other‚Äôs cases by being so good  - Lakers aren‚Äôt a top 2 seed currently but lebron is obviously a perennial candidate   - Joel has a case but his injury is scary  - Nuggets aren‚Äôt good enough for Jokic to win it  - Giannis is a top 5 player in the league in terms of impacting winning, maybe #1 depending on how he‚Äôs playing  Jimmy is right up there with most of these guys in terms of impacting winning. He shouldn‚Äôt even be in the conversation you say?"
"Just because they have access to the ‚Äúbest modern medicine‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt experiencing racism from the ‚Äúbest modern medicine.‚Äù Serena Williams is richer than almost all NBA players are she had to beg and advocate for herself during her pregnancy to get tested for a recurrence of blood clots. She could tell something was wrong and the medical staff didn‚Äôt believe her at first. Further, some good experiences don‚Äôt overpower generations and generations of oppression. Like, come on. If anything, the fact that these guys only got access to top tier medical science after they became millionaires just perpetuates the racism they experience. They know they wouldn‚Äôt be getting the kind of treatment they do if they were just regular Donovan Mitchell who works at a car factory or regular Chris Paul who works as a chef or whatever. It just shows how fucked the medical field in America is where rich people‚Äôs lives are more valuable than poor people‚Äôs because of capitalism."
Donovan Mitchell and KAT leading a team right to the lottery lol
KAT doesn‚Äôt have Donovan Mitchell
Dmitch needs to stop playing like OKC westbrook when he has a great team around him. Pass Donovan pass pass pass. Sometimes the dude is the 4th best player for Utah. That never should happen to any star as normally as it happens to Mitchell
"Mitchell is becoming a mini OKC westbrook minus the mvp, the rebounding ability, and the passing ability. Literally minus all the good the of OKC westbrook and add some shooting ability and you get Donovan mitchell"
Donovan mitchell is why. Notice they didn't include bogey who was also way in the negative.
"Maybe not shoot us out of it so much, but just took us out of our rhythm. It became Donovan Mitchell ball, not Utah Jazz ball"
"The Jazz can get so much better if they find good replacements for Favors and Bogey. Aside from Donovan Mitchell, I think the rest of them fill their roles just fine."
Everybody can hit Rudy for lobs except Donovan Mitchell
Donovan Mitchell has a chance. 3 point would be the toughest for him. But it would be possible in a year Curry doesn't participate
Donovan Mitchell maybe?
Donovan mitchell is on the best team in the league.
i was gonna mention that but ROY seems much more tame compared to the two big ones and easy to hand wave  unless you are donovan mitchell haha
"I mean he literally would. Look at bird play and look at harden play. Use your eyes. The game has evolved. Bird doesn‚Äôt have hesis or step backs. People weren‚Äôt even doing the euro step until the 2000s.  The game went through an evolution in the 90s with the popularity of Jordan and the street ball scene that followed after. Guard skills are better than ever. Look at someone like Jamal Murray or Donovan Mitchell, not even a top 5 guard in their conference yet they have guard skills that the best point guards in the 80s didn‚Äôt have.   I‚Äôll be downvoted to shit but I ardently believe this. Idc."
People here like to call him bust just looking at his shooting %. No doubt sometimes he is dreadful but there are no reasons why he has 2.6 FTA. Donovan Mitchell (similar playstyle) gets twice more FT attempts.
No they can‚Äôt. You aren‚Äôt winning with your best player being Donovan Mitchell with all due respect
"Let me put it in another way. If Lebron had the 1st seed, he would have won that year. There is no MVP candidate who was also the only 1st seed to lose the MVP. Never ever , in 40 years at least.  The narrative is generally what is built to explain what can already be explained better by mere seeding.  &gt; Donovan Mitchell  Is not an MVP candidate, he is hardly the MVP of his team.  To win the MVP you have to be an MVP candidate first (I already wrote that), i.e. clear best guy on your team.  And I quote myself  &gt; Every.single.time that two MVP candidates go head to head, the one with the hghest seeding wins. Only exception was Westbrook in 2017.  It is not hard to understand. It is true for 30 years at least."
"Losing a season at 23, he doesn‚Äôt have a ton of miles on his joints. Murray is the same age as Devin Booker, Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell. All three are better players at the moment but none have reached their peak yet either. 17-18 season he earned NBA All-Defensive Second Team honors, becoming the youngest player in NBA history to be named All-Defense. Now he‚Äôs figuring out his offensive game and this kid could be scary."
"But Rose didn‚Äôt just win on seeding alone, he needed narrative to push him. It literally took him asking the media ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt I be the MVP?‚Äù to put him in the conversation.  I don‚Äôt see seeding as a rule for picking the MVP, but a consequence. Of course they tend to be #1 or #2, they‚Äôre great at basketball. If we picked based on seeding, Donovan Mitchell would be in MVP talks. Donovan Mitchell is great, but other players are doing more things better in other areas of the game.  I don‚Äôt think that anybody is arguing that narrative is the way to pick, but it‚Äôs just what happens. Russ and Kobe have MVPs because of narrative, and Giannis won‚Äôt win a third because of it *unless* the Bucks have a really strong showing in this second half. If the season ended now and Embiid were out of consideration for whatever reason the media would give it to Jokic or LeBron due to narrative."
"Nah he just couldn't get them to fall.   Also, I think he's probably more of a 2 who can operate as a PG in a pinch a la FVV or Donovan Mitchell."
"Hot take but I'm gonna say Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine, KAT, DBook or whoever in the next generation of stars wants to come here   I think the current crop of big stars don't care about us but our chance is with the next generation"
Donovan Mitchell
"Clippers have been doing load management and Lakers are without AD. What is Utah's excuse? Knicks are worse than the Raptors, Pacers, and Wizards but all 3 of those teams had to deal with issues related to covid, that will be reflected in the outcome of the playoffs at the end of the season. We will see what happens with the Jazz but I have doubts and do not consider them a stronger playoff team than the Clippers, Suns, and Nuggets. Maybe they'll prove me wrong. I think that would be fun to watch. I like Donovan Mitchell a lot. He doesn't get the respect that he deserves. West just has a lot of talent"
"Donovan Mitchell has had a TON of awful shooting nights, and Bradley Beal had a game that he literally went exactly 1-14 from the field on February 5. I won't say Murray is as good as Beal, but you can't say that all-stars don't have shitty games. Averages exist for a reason."

"Bradley Beal has much better stats than Jamal Murray, and Donovan Mitchell has similar/slightly better stats and he is on a winning team.  This isn't difficult to comprehend."
Donovan Mitchell is on a first seeded team.
But he flat out has way better stats than Donovan Mitchell or Mike Conley this year.
Donovan Mitchell is too disrespected. Primary scorer on leagues best team
"Here you go https://www.espn.com.au/nba/insider/story/_/id/31045292/ten-nba-things-like-including-donovan-mitchell-evolution    For Lowe's 10 things always go on Espn australia, it's free there."
Donovan Mitchell does it sometimes when he's coming off a screen and driving to the hoop
"Actually was just throwing in Donovan Mitchell, 4 guys that I'm sure Shaq would have great chemistry with. Shaq has had issues with all of them at a point."
was it wrong of the NBA to select Donovan Mitchell as an all-star over Booker?
"Hey look, Luke Kennard getting minutes.  Remember when we drafted him when we were projected to draft Donovan Mitchell.  Yes I‚Äôm salty"
"You‚Äôre not serious lol. Also, no discredit to Donovan Mitchell, he‚Äôs a great player, but he also inherited a 50 win team. ‚ÄúLeading his team‚Äù to a playoff birth just comes off as out of touch to me"
"There has to be an extreme bias going on for anyone arguing that Donovan Mitchell is better than Kyrie, when Kyrie does literally everything Mitchell does but at a higher level and more efficiently"
"Has to hurt that you guys passed up on Bam Adebayo, Donovan Mitchell and Dearron fox for him, but hindsight is 20/20"
"Unlikely. Considering where he started, his shooting is the best it could possibly be. His finishing has still been sub-par, he can run PnR but unless it‚Äôs with Zion it‚Äôs not a *great* idea, and in that case the real threat is Zion not Lonzo. Also in 3 years who of Shai, Luka, Fox, Steph, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Jamal Murray, and possibly Dame will he be better than? If he isn‚Äôt better then at least 2 he isn‚Äôt making an all-star game chief (assuming they all stay in the West, which is a big if but like, still).  In short, the Pelicans are gonna get 29 calls about Lonzo at the trade deadline because he‚Äôs THAT good when paired with the right talent. Could he make an all-star team as an injury replacement or something, yeah. But perennial? C‚Äômon now."
That never happened at my school. I feel bad for donovan mitchell.
Remember when /r/nba had a massive hate boner for Rudy that was so bad we thought Donovan Mitchell absolutely hated his guts so much that Donovan didn't want to play with Gobert anymore? I remember.
Wow I didn't know Donovan Mitchell grew up in Utah.../s
"He's been exclusively a SG this year. Not in the past, but even he and Nash have said so.  I would also include Booker, Jaylen Brown, Zach Lavine, Donovan Mitchell and Shai Gilgeous Alexander"
".......50k and one week. lol. Donovan Mitchell got fined 25k for talking about a ref. Resident Bench Applause Meyers Leonard gets to say slurs on a Twitch stream and gets a week off and a 50k fine. He was injured anyway, btw. What a fuckin joke"
how often do you think that happens? this sub (and the lakers) were beside themselves like a week ago because donovan mitchell said bitch on the court
Donovan Mitchell
"Donovan Mitchell was a fined $25,000 for criticizing the refs. I wonder how much the fine would be if a player called the ref a k\*ke"
"The thing that surprised me was seeing Donovan Mitchell on the court, which I didn't realize at the time. He ended up getting diagnosed that night, too."
"Donovan Mitchell  Jamal Murray  MPJ  Nikola Jokic  Rudy Golbert   Bench:  Monte Morris, Gary Harris, Melo, Josef Nurkic  Solid."
"Right... but you tried to compare THjr to Donovan Mitchell. Which obviously you're being a troll when you say that, just pointing out how stupid of an argument it is."
The Jazz were without Donovan Mitchell in both of those games and still won fairly easily.

Donovan Mitchell
"Yeah, having a front office that passed on Paul George, Kemba, Giannis, Klay, Devin Booker, and Donovan Mitchell definitely didn't help."
That‚Äôs not what he‚Äôs saying he‚Äôs basically saying when comes down to the playoffs it‚Äôs going Donovan Mitchell who takes them to the next level   Gobert a floor raiser   Mitchell a ceiling raiser
Donovan Mitchell doesn't count?
"Is he better than Steph? Is he better than Dame? Is he better than Luka? Is he better than Kyrie? Is he better than Donovan Mitchell? Cuz those are the guys ahead of him, as rated by the fan, media, and coaches vote for all star... he‚Äôs very properly rated."
People consider him to be on the same level as Donovan Mitchell so I think he's perfectly rated
"They're definitely tied together, but it's not exact. Donovan Mitchell is *only* 17th in the league for OnCourt +/- per 100 possessions. That said there's an undeniable correlation between being high for +/- and playing on a winning team."
"I appreciate this actually. It's petty, but you admit it's petty and have a story to back it up. I won't play like I don't have petty hate for players too (Donovan Mitchell)."
"I mean just going by this season 3-point shooting:  Joe Ingles- 50% on 5.5 Attempts per game Joe Harris- 48.2% on 6.7 attempts a game Duncan Robinson- 40.4% on on 8.6 attempts per game.   Huge drop off there in percentage. Just got some perspective Donovan Mitchell is shooting 40.3% on 8.6 attempts, nearly identical to Robinson and he‚Äôs been known as a chucker. So yes there‚Äôs a drop off after Ingles and Harris."
Why is Donovan Mitchell not a front runner for MVP? The guy gets underrated
"Donovan Mitchell had that name before the NBA, the people around him didn‚Äôt know any better."

I doubt it. Too constricting. Too much past to Steph and getting yelled at by draymond. Charlotte is chill. These smaller market places are often better to develop talent anyway like Donovan Mitchell in Utah or x in y
"peak Melo is more than a star.   29/7/3 is a near superstar season.  Donovan Mitchell and Tatum are both stars, but Tatum is clearly the better player."

Utah jazz just set the NBA record for most 3's in a half with 18. Donovan Mitchell came in with 6 of 7 from 3 to lead them. That man will be the next to be included in conversations about players in the caliber of Kobe and LeBron.

First of all. Donovan Mitchell is the most beloved person in the state of Utah. Second of all I can‚Äôt believe how fucking stupid you sound with this response. Jazz fans are apparently no longer allowed to say positive things towards players who are white because that automatically means we hate players who are black. For fuck sake you sound like a fucking idiot
Donovan Mitchell.
It turns out that a lot of fear is a result of a lack of understanding. Here we see Donovan Mitchell getting to know what its like to be an airplane getting hit by some projectiles but finishing its job anyway
Donovan mitchell swooping in for a ring while no one is expecting would be fantastic.
Donovan Mitchell
But if that's the only criteria than Donovan Mitchell is the MVP cause Utah's record is so much better than the rest of the league.
"I hope someone with a lot of time can go through past draft graders for a big offseason shitpost. I was just looking at a few post-draft grade articles from 2016 and 2017, and there are a bunch of terible takes. From things like saying the Celtics screwed up with both of their top picks, to guys like Dragan Bender and Henry Ellenson getting high grades while guys like Donovan Mitchell and Bam were called bad picks."
Lol says the guy that totally unnecessarily dumped all over Donovan Mitchell. Shaq isn‚Äôt wrong here but he‚Äôs kind of a hypocrite about this
"Look, I'm fucking sick of people calling the Jazz a racist organization. Give me one proven instance where someone in the organization has done something racist. Are there going to be racist ass hat fans? Of course. But it's not a Utah Jazz problem.  Here's when Dennis Lindsey texted a beat writer about a piece on racial equality:  ‚ÄúGordon, thanks for the article two days ago. I was late reading it, but my wife said you knocked it out of the park! You did. Sport can lead in the area of diversity. We have a great state full of good people, which gives us a start to lead by being on the right side of this issue. But we cannot equivocate on [it]. There is just so much ignorance. When a basic historical period like Reconstruction comes up, I cannot believe how many educated people cannot hold a basic conversation on this issue and the problems with that period. Given the atrocities that came before and the point of racial equality now, it keeps me up at night. Keep spewing the truth. And feel free to share this text widely. I am proud of your efforts. It is way more important than a game, which ironically is illuminating this dynamic. Sincerely, Dennis.‚Äù  How come the investigation turned up literally zero evidence of anyone in the Jazz organization being racist?  Look at what Donovan said after the whole Russell Westbrook incident:  ‚ÄúIn this business, to have your owner to be so forward and so out there to back us the way she did, and to back Russell, that‚Äôs amazing. That‚Äôs the incredible thing about the NBA, as we all know all sports aren‚Äôt like that,"" Mitchell said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs been been open and honest, and in my two years knowing her, that‚Äôs one of the things I respect. Everything you hear about the Miller family is nothing but positive, and this is just another instance of that.‚Äù  I love the Jazz and wish people would stop shit smearing them. And if anyone wants to say that the Jazz as an organization have racially based issues, give me a citation. I don't know what Elijah Millsap heard, but it makes no sense for a guy with 20+ NBA experience and a history of activity for racial equality just wake up one day and decide to be racist. This is bullshit."
"It's true. Ever since that Donovan Mitchell interview, Shaq has been noticeably ""nicer"" and complimentary to other players. I honestly don't think he can handle being the bad guy, and there's nothing wrong with that."

*Donovan Mitchell has entered the chat*
It's not totally unheard of. Donovan Mitchell and Embiid both increased their per100 scoring their rookie years vs college. And plenty of guys like Zion and Kyrie have held similar levels.  His scoring is outstanding already. I think we'll really see it with his passing. He makes a lot of smart plays but on OSU that doesn't lead to assists. There were so many PnRs where he didn't really have a chance to hit the roller because the defense collapsed and didn't respect their shooters. Then he'd hit the shooter and they'd miss.  Defenses can't do that against most NBA teams.
Donovan Mitchell led his team through a playoff win and went on to be an all star the season he was signing that extension.  To say Mitchell and Wiggins had similar careers prior to signing their extensions is just wrong. Mitchell had earned his extension by that point
"Donovan Mitchell literally signed a max based on extremely similar shooting splits, so I disagree.   Wiggins went on to average 17 because of a roster/ coaching change and was still a starter on the 4th ranked offense in the league. Dude was still 100% getting the max. And"
I mean guards will always have lower ts% percentage as they need to take jumper so its a bit unfair to compare them with ts% league average which got averaged up due to centre taking easy shots.   Donovan mitchell last season also has similar stats with dlo and was an all star so i think dlo was playing well last season for us
"Everyone is so quick to jump the gun and be worried about losing Tatum and Brown, when they are 23 and 24. Is Miami going to be worried about losing Bam if they lose in the first or second round this year? Is Sacramento worried about losing De'Aaron Fox since he was also just signed to a 5-year max and they can't put help around him? Is Ben Simmons going to demand a trade if they don't make the finals yet again? Same for Donovan Mitchell if the Jazz don't win this year? What about Sabonis or Devin Booker?  All of these guys are the same ages as Tatum/Brown, but I never hear this narrative about them, except maybe Simmons in trade rumors, and they all haven't won a championship yet either.  Everyone said the same thing about Giannis and then he stayed in Milwaukee. I understand where it comes from when it does happen and guys want out, I just don't know what kind of power they have with 3/4 years left on $24M+ deals where any trade to match salary would send them to a bad team or a contender would be losing key pieces to match salary and they'd be in the exact same spot in a different location. Celtics aren't buying them out lol.  They have literally no leverage to demand a trade this offseason and if you make the playoffs 4 years in a row and made it to the ECF in 2/4 of those where you're the main guy(s), why would you want out that bad?  James Harden spent 8 years in Houston. KD spent 9 in OKC. LeBron stuck it out with the Cavs for 7. Paul George in Indiana for 7. AD with the Pelicans for 7. Melo with Denver for 7.5. Lillard has spent his entire career with Portland. Embiid has played 5 season with the Sixers and there's no mention of him jumping ship. Jokic 6 years in Denver and no one is saying he's going to demand a trade. None of these guys won championships with those teams.  Why does everyone act like their window is closed now or very soon after just 4 years when people act like their help (Kemba Walker, 4 time All-Star, coming back from injury/surgery. Marcus Smart, 1st team All Defense, coming back from injury. Evan Fournier, 18 PPG scoring option, 2 games in) is no help at all? This narrative is nonsense."
"So you‚Äôre not Donovan mitchell, and that‚Äôs okay"
&gt;	Donovan playing and Mitchell sitting  Lol found shaq
"damn! Donovan Mitchell? I'm OOTL, he got some kind of flight trauma now?"
"Utah Jazz definitely has final destination vibes, first Covid, now this   If you Donovan Mitchell at Disney, don't go on the ride with him"
"Gobert is still the better player by a comfortable margin. We win last night without Mitchell, but with Donovan playing and Mitchell sitting we‚Äôd definitely have lost. Rudy‚Äôs on/off stats this year are stupidly good"
"If you were already scared of flying like Donovan Mitchell was then this happens to you??  I'm not scared of flying and I actually like it, but I would understand if he never wanted to fly again."
I don't mind coming to Donovan Mitchell.
"you're not donovan mitchell, you're expendable"
Donovan Mitchell
But Donovan mitchell very well may be an olympic gold.medalist in the future. So he would know what it means to be an unlikely statistic üò¨
"You have an absurd understanding of what most shooting guards do, haha.  Danny can barely dribble, so he typically just catches and shoots from the perimeter.  But that's not all 2 guards...Donovan Mitchell is a 2 guard.    A typical shooting guard can handle the ball some and drive and pass a bit and does more than stand in the corner and shoot, my dude."

I have a Donovan Mitchell throwback mountain jersey. That era definitely solidified the entire state as Jazz fans and the huge success of their throwbacks shows that.
"Donovan ""Night Train"" Mitchell"
"Spida, lol. I‚Äôll forever remember Donovan Mitchell as Speedo, so he‚Äôs got that going for him."
"That is a pretty simplistic way of looking at things, just binary ""Did you win a title?"" Yes--&gt;You're an all time great  No--&gt;Your stats were meaningless  There is pretty clearly some middle ground there. And I agree with you that when the obviously great players like LeBron and KD get criticized for not winning enough to talking heads' liking, it is complete bullshit and clearly leads to superteams. I am not defending the talking heads.  However, I must say that the argument that you can't win a title with Westbrook as your number 1 or maybe even number 2 guy is totally valid. The guy just shows over and over again he can't play disciplined basketball in the playoffs. I can think of so many examples of series where OKC, on paper, based on the notion that Westbrook was a top 6-8 guy and his teammate was a top 10 guy as well (or in the case of Durant, top 2/3), underperformed. 2016 WCF vs GSW. Struggled to score in the halfcourt in the last 3 games. Which was a pretty common theme of that era. Scott Brooks always took the blame for that, but Scott Brooks was gone in 2016 and the team still bogged down. Remember 2018 vs Utah in the first round? Everybody remembers Paul George having a rough series after game 1 when he went off, but everybody forgets Westbrook losing shootouts to Donovan Mitchell and stinking it up on defense. 2019 vs Lillard he got torched. Embarrassed. I'm not even that big a Lillard guy, but I am 100% confident that if I were building a team from scratch to win in the playoffs I would rather have Lillard as my top 1 or 2 guy than the best version of Westbrook."
PG - Joe Ingles  SG - Donovan Mitchell  SF - Jae Crowder  PF - Paul Millsap  C - Rudy Gobert  Basically a worse version of the current Utah Jazz. We'd likely be a 4-6 seed in the West this season and lose in the first round to the Lakers.
"Yeah he reminds me some of last years version of SGA. I think SGA now has gotten alot better but in terms of floaters, scoop shots, not being able to quite get enough separation to get to the rim, not being super athletic finishing at the rim, willing shooter at all 3 levels etc. SGA has a slow release which affects his catch and shoot 3 point attempts, in Haliburton's case he has more a line drive 3 point shot which can affect how often he can get it off vs taller defenders. As a passer he reminds me some of Derrick White, Haliburton's main passing value is on drives + manipulating and looking off defenders till the last second  Anthony Edwards I think the hope kind of has to be he's Donovan Mitchell with more strength when it comes to finishing at the rim while probably not being as good a catch and shoot 3 point shooter."
"Unfortunately that's been the sports media formula for a long time now because attacking players is the easiest way for them to be ""right"". If a player ends up not achieving whatever standard is set (like Shaq saying Donovan Mitchell isn't a superstar, countless non-ring chasers criticized for not winning rings, etc), they point to it and say ""hey look at me, I was right the whole time"". If the player ends up improving then the talking head takes credit for it and says ""they wouldn't have been able to do it without my criticism elevating them"" (like Skip did with LeBron years ago).   I really wish more sports media would take the risk with the reverse of this phenomenon, by hyping up lesser known players and informing you of young upcoming guys who you should have your eye on. But that comes with the risk of being ""wrong"", whereas attacking players is always going to be a ""winning"" situation for the media since they can always either claim credit or claim they were right all along. Tom Brady embarrassing Max Kellerman's stupid Cliff argument is pretty much the only exception to this rule (and even then he could still decline quickly in the next few years and Max would say ""hey I was right the whole time, I was just too early"")."
He‚Äôs still developing and he was hurt. Jamal is gonna ball out again in the playoffs. I‚Äôm pretty sure of it. He‚Äôs so underrated on here. A guy like ben Simmons is once again gonna get nerfed in the postseason and Jamal will up his game and then the circle jerk between the 2 will reverse.  I also think the Donovan Mitchell hate has gone too far. I expect Mitchell to have a good postseason as well.
"&gt;Historically though, when you think of the greats how many of them are above 6'3?  It's not just about height, it's about total size.  Almost all the great heavyweights other than Tyson and Frazier are his height or taller, and all of them are much more stoutly built.   Russ has like a 30-32"" waist, he is slight even for a nba player.   He is 2 inches taller and ~15# lighter than guys like Donovan Mitchell, Eric Bledsoe and Reggie Jackson, and none of those guys are particularly built or chubby.     You may notice that the all-time great heavyweights all have relatively wide hips and waists (like Ali, Holmes, Tyson, Foreman and so forth who are all at about 36"" waist in their prime).  It provides a leverage advantage and allows them to pack on additional mass to protect themselves from blows.  Westbrook may have the height and reach to be one, but he isn't built like someone who is meant to fight at heavyweight.    &gt;As for the other stuff, its not that he doesnt have those, its more that basketball doesnt present the opportunities for it  Right, that's my point.  We don't have anywhere near enough evidence to indicate that he has the potential to be an all time great like OP was claiming.  Being an elite athlete alone isn't close to being enough, and the particular natural talent variables that make for a good boxer don't share much overlap with those that make for a good basketball player."
"I think KD knows and can't forget that suspicion is on him since the time they were up 3-1 on the Warriors, they needed just one more game against the team that they have been beating, but they managed to lose three games in a row, and it became known that KD had already made up his mind, before that series, to leave, and then after the three games lost he did leave and went to none other than the Warriors...        In those three games lost, to me, KD did not seem really excited and motivated to win.  We saw the likes of Donovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray in last year's playoffs for instance,  did KD display similar passionate effort to win in the three games mentioned? I don't think so.       Why leave anyway? Even if you surprisingly lost 4-3, you could beat that team the following year(s)? The OKC franchise had invested on you all those years, waited for you only to reach that situation and perform?"
"Reminds me of when Shaq tried to ‚Äúencourage‚Äù Donovan Mitchell by putting him down, his response was ‚Äúaight‚Äù."
Mitchell?? As in Donovan?
Denver gave Utah both Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert
"Let me guess, must play for the Lakers.   If Donovan Mitchell was on the Lakers everyone would say he is a super star."
Donovan Mitchell tweets the praying hands emoji (obviously as a result of this event) and twitter morons show up to talk shit on him.  The internet is great.
"We are, but in case you are wondering Donovan Mitchell has a better PER, which takes into account other parts of the game and not just scoring."
"It‚Äôs significant when you take into account that Donovan is also averaging one more assist, usually someone with more assists has more turnovers. Their TS is so close that if Booker has 2 bad games in a row and Mitchell has 2 good games in a row, they will be just about the same. I personally think Mitchell is better, but they are definitely in the same tier. If you think differently, you are insane."
Also I don‚Äôt see why shaq is getting destroyed for his take either. Donovan Mitchell is a star which is good but he‚Äôs not on the superstar level
I think Donovan Mitchell is on the level of like booker and Lavine which isn‚Äôt bad but he needs to get on the beal/Tatum level
"Doesn‚Äôt Denver also have bad luck with trading draft prospects that ends up being really good, or was that only for Donovan Mitchell?"
Trey Lyles: 1-time Indiana Mr. Basketball  Donovan Mitchell: 0-time Indiana Mr. Basketball  It shouldn't be an argument by now. Lyles will always be better than Mitchell.
Ya but it‚Äôs Donovan Mitchell.  I can dunk and Back in the day when I could really get up I had no preference beside with two hands you can be sure no one will strip it.  Well not be sure but be more sure I guess.

"Pistons drafted Luke Kennard ahead of Donovan Mitchell. Bam Adebayo was still on the board but it was clearly between Kennard and Mitchell for the 12th pick, and at this point it's pretty much indefensible."
Donovan Mitchell. We took the Nard dog (Luke Kennard)
Luke Kennard over Donovan Mitchell (LOL)
"idk how you can rank Donovan below Murray, fox, SGA , and Trae. he's far better. Booker, Mitchell and Tatum are on another tier currently imo"
"Donovan in March: 28.8/4.3/6.1 on 46.6/43.1/88, 8-4 record  Tatum in March: 25.3/6.5/4.3 on 48.7/42.2/81.8, 6-7 record  Booker in March: 24.3/5.4/5.2 on 46.6/31.5/86.2, 9-3 record  Honestly at this point these players are all pretty much on the same level. I don't understand why everybody is always so quick to say Mitchell is worse"
Which is fair.   However I have a hard time putting someone like Donovan Mitchell above him when Mitchell averages less points on way more shots while also being a poor defender.
Donovan Mitchell would be a great 6th man
"Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker are better than Zion Williamson. Zion is looking good though, at least he did last night for long stretches."

Donovan Mitchell because he wins them playoff games
"It's a bizarro-world catch-22.   Nobody really gets how good Rudy is. And nobody really watches Utah play.  Then, Donovan transforms into this cerebral &amp; athletic monster of a guard.  But bcz most Jazz fans &amp; legit analysts keep saying Rudy is Utah's best player, ""joe redditor neffew"" thinks Donovan must not be that good; cuz even Jazz fans think Mitchell&lt;Gobert (who sucks cuz he couldn't defend Steph on the perimeter while injured in the playoffs in 2015)"
sga IS an all star level player  his numbers are better than donovan mitchell despite not having his spacing
"Mitchell on/off: -4.5  Gobert on/off +17  Unless it‚Äôs garbage time when Rudy‚Äôs off Mitchell‚Äôs on and visa versa, so Donovan‚Äôs not a net negative by any means but it‚Äôs pretty clear who our best player is. And that‚Äôs not including tonight where Rudy was +38 and Donovan +8"
"Donovan Mitchell, only because the Jazz should want him to be the face of their franchise."
every team wants this but if you put luka on the jazz... holy shit. Donovan mitchell is good but... man luka would become so triple double machine
"Donovan Mitchell, the only game Memphis won is the game he didn‚Äôt play. That should tell you all you need to know."
time for Kennard to finally show what a clamp down defender he is and lockdown Donovan Mitchell
"Donovan Mitchell. Clippers role players don't really score on the interior anyway so I don't think Gobert is gonna have as big an impact as people think, Clippers bigs are pretty irrelevant + they usually go small anyway (vs. Mavs they ran Batum at center)... Mitchell's offense is gonna be more important than Gobert's defense and PG is firmly a second option behind Kawhi"
Donovan Mitchell has the same 35.5 PPG in the playoffs over the past two seasons.  And Mitchell's 66.6% TS is much better than Luka's (57.4% entering tonight).
Gobert outright is better than Paul George and Donovan Mitchell performs way better in the playoffs too.
"Dwade had a 6‚Äô11‚Äù wingspans which is why he was so effective on D and had so many blocks. Mitchell is only 6‚Äô1‚Äù but he‚Äôs got a 6‚Äô10‚Äù wingspan.  The ‚Äúproblem‚Äù is the jazz defense lets people on the perimeter go right to the paint. Because everything is fed to Rudy. It allows them to get away with playing Royce (6‚Äô4‚Äù) at PF. So it‚Äôs hard to get a real sense of how effective Don is on defense. But he has all the physical tools and as a rookie, he was drafted for his defensive potential. I just think playing with Rudy makes defense so much easier for all the perimeter defenders.  ‚ÄúPerhaps the most appealing part of Mitchell's profile, particularly early on in his career, lies on the defensive end. Two years under Rick Pitino has benefited him greatly in this regard, as he's emerged as a multi-positional stopper who a coach can sic on point guards, shooting guards and even some small forwards and expect results.‚Äù - [DraftExpress Article](http://www.draftexpress.com/article/donovan-mitchell-nba-draft-scouting-report-and-video-analysis-5941/)"
Donovan Mitchell will outplay pg with ease
which is why paul george and kawhi leonard were 4-0 but donovan mitchell was 4-3 in the first round. wait
Lol yeah guys like donovan mitchell average more than kd lmao üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"Kinda funny seeing Luka above Jordan, Ja Morant above Allen Iverson, Devin Booker above KD, Donovan Mitchell above Steph Curry. Maybe let's wait for a larger sample size?"
"The Jazz have a top 5 defense and the Mavs don‚Äôt. Donovan Mitchell has averaged 28 ppg in the playoffs through his career. Is that not superstar level? Oh, and the the Jazz have 2 other all stars, which the Mavs do not have."
"They'll go back into pretending they aren't blind haters lmao  These fools aside I can't wait to see clips vs jazz, I love both teams and want a great series and everyone healthy and some nutty Donovan Mitchell transition 3s"
Then it will come down to if Donovan Mitchell is the next coming of Dwade or Kawhi being the best player in the NBA
"They have Donovan Mitchell though. You know, the guy that can go for 30 any given night."
Jazz..Great 3 pt shooting team. Great Defensive team..Donovan Mitchell. Clippers do not stand a chance in my opinion.
Donovan Mitchell has help. It won't be easy.
Watching the guy you drafted instead of Donovan Mitchell hit a 3 in game 7 of a playoff game...for another team. Just Pistons things.
Donovan Mitchell needs to avenge the Mavs üòû
People voted for this over Donovan Mitchell
"The man averaged 26.4 ppg, I'd say that is superstar level. I say this as not even the biggest donovan Mitchell fan as well"
Me if I ever played against Donovan Mitchell
I think LaVine is still underrated because of his team's record. I think he's better than Jaylen Brown and on par with Donovan Mitchell.
"It's no win-win scenario for them at all.  You have KD who wanted to play, who then despised the Warriors for not stopping him  and You have Donovan Mitchell who also wanted too play,  but the  medical staff refused to let him play."
Bradley Beal  Devin Booker  Donovan Mitchell  Zach LaVine  Jaylen Brown (count him as a SF though)
"I get your point, but bad example since game 1 the Jazz were playing without Donovan Mitchell. Now the Nets are in control without Harden lol."
Donovan Mitchell is universally beloved. Gobert on the other hand..
"shoutout Donovan Mitchell though, love his game and he‚Äôs a very like-able guy too. At least y‚Äôall got a real one with him, i don‚Äôt see many people disliking him at all"
Hahaha ok come on Ben Gordon?? Not even close  Ben Gordon is closer to Ben McLemore than Donovan Mitchell
I thought he was Donovan Mitchell for some stupid reason
A Donovan Mitchell and Dame pairing would be fucking amazing
"Interesting ‚ÄòWhat-If‚Äô...when in Charlotte, he supposedly jumped on the table for them to draft Donovan Mitchell instead of Monk. I‚Äôd like to think Mitchell is a star regardless, but who knows.ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Hed be the best player on the jazz and yes they could win a title if they replace donovan Mitchell with Dame
Donovan Mitchell is the best player on that Utah team in terms of offense. Obviously it's difficult to be better than rudy gobert defensively but without mitchell this team simply does not click into place. He is the best player on the jazz team 100%
"I‚Äôm late here but goddamn you‚Äôre right. I‚Äôm not an advocate for *not* talking about debatably the best player ever, but he lost. He‚Äôs out. And who is still in? Trae Young, Giannis, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Kawhi, Jokic, KD, Harden, Kyrie....the best and most exciting players mixed with the future of the NBA. Let‚Äôs talk about them until we are blue in the face. Oh and the arguably best player in the league right now, Luka."
Eh Let‚Äôs pump the breaks a bit. Phil drafted Frank Ntilikina over Donovan Mitchell because Franky Smokes fit the triangle better.
"Last year: ""Mitchell the level he's at now is even higher than Kobe was during his championship runs""  Donovan &gt; Kobe"
"I mean I know it was the bubble, but last years Donovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray duel was insane. Both had 2 50 point games and tons of clutch buckets and game 7 came down to the final shot"
"Dame wanted them to draft Donovan Mitchell, but they ended up with Zach Collins. If he ran that ship they would have listened instead of being so dumb."
"Donovan Mitchell was during his first two years, it ain't that uncommon.  It's okay to admit he has ONE weakness, jfc, it's not like I'm saying he's a bad player lmao."
That's just not true and Donovan Mitchell their star scorer was missing and coming back from injuries
"Pat Bev was there for the 1st year with MDA, Ariza for year 1 and 2, PJ for years 2-4, and Capela for years 1-3.5. I don't think that is the difference defensively between Rockets and Blazers. Don't get me wrong, PJ is an amazing defender and Capella was good but he wasn't as impactful with Rockets as he has been with the Hawks defensively. Ariza was amazing and definitely huge for the year as the #6 defense but the last 2 years the Rockets were better than the Blazers even without him.  I think the biggest issue is having 2 average at best defensively starting guards. Dame is below average and CJ is better but not amazing. In the West especially I feel like a lot of the major scoring threats are Guards. Curry, Harden, Jamal Murray, Luka, Ja Morant, CP3, Booker, Donovan Mitchell, and Klay Thompson when healthy. I think that's a huge reason Blazers played the Nuggets so close, especially with Jamal out. It's bad when Austin Rivers is exploiting your defense in the playoffs."
No you‚Äôre completely wrong because I like Donovan Mitchell more. DBook? More like DTabloid because he‚Äôs always fake. You just wouldn‚Äôt get it
Donovan Mitchell
"This year really does feel like the changing of the guard in the NBA a little bit, if the Mavs close this out the remaining 8 teams will be led by their stars of:  Donovan Mitchell/Rudy Gobert (never made Finals)  Devin Booker/CP3 (never made Finals)  Nikola Jokic (never made Finals)  Luka Doncic (never made Finals)  Joel Embiid/Ben Simmons (never made Finals)  Giannis (never made Finals)  Trae Young (never made Finals)  and then KD who has won Finals/Harden who's never been  Other than the Nets it's allll fresh blood from a superstars perspective. And same from an organization perspective for the most part. Exciting times!"
"You right, gonna go make a Who You Got Devin Booker or Donovan Mitchell thread instead."
De'Aaron Fox  Donovan Mitchell  Dame  Ja
"I always see these lists and they never include Donovan Mitchell, who continues to improve every single season."
You went with someone who hasn‚Äôt been drafted and didn‚Äôt include Donovan Mitchell? Wake up nephew.
"This is just like Shaq telling Donovan that he doesn‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a superstar, and then a few weeks later, when Mitchell continued his great play, said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome Utah!‚Äù These guys really can‚Äôt own up lmao"
1. Giannis 2. Luka 3. Tatum 4. Booker 5. Trae 6. Zion 7. Donovan Mitchell 8. Sabonis 9. SGA 10. Ja

You guys were draws because you had a clear cut superstar on the team who won the MVP and his personal brand of basketball that was unprecedented at the time. We're talking about a top 15 all-time player in his prime here. You can't expect the same excitement about Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell.
Lol imagine thinking Donovan Mitchell deserved MVP votes this year
"Conley has a teammate named Donovan Mitchell who averaged 29/3/6 on 61% TS against Memphis. Of course, he missed the first game but winning four immediately following his return was an indication that he was a major difference. He also scored 30 points on two separate occasions IIRC."
"No, it's not. The quality will not be the same in bball with seeing LeBron and curry vs Donovan Mitchell and idk dbook, I like book but bron and curry much more a of a draw. Its not marketing that made them a draw, but the success they had. That's what y'all don't understand"
"Donovan Mitchell easily and it's not remotely close. When talking about young players people have brought up Ja, Trae, Zion, Tatum, and Luka, and no one even brings this guy's name up just for an honorable mention. He was the superstar on the best team in the playoffs and Russell Westbrook had more MVP votes than him. He had two 50 point playoff games at age 23 and still doesn't get brought up in the convo for best young player. Luka is the only player under 25 that is better than Donovan Mitchell, and I think we'll see if that holds true real soon..."
"Yes.  This so much.  Olshey had made some great moves and his team is very good at evaluating guard talent, but Portland's forward situation has been abysmal since we lost LMA and Batum.    The 2016 offseason and the 2017 draft are the core reasons for the situation we're in.  The 2017 draft is just crushing.  It isn't his fault that Zach Collins has been perpetually injured, and Collins could have been a good player, but the decision to trade up 2-for-1 for him was questionable at the time.  That was a deep draft and they list of players we missed out on is absurd.  With the 10th pick (we traded 15 and 20 for it) we could have had Donovan Mitchell or Bam Adebayo.  With 15 we could have had John Collins, who many perferred to Zach Collins.  With 20 we could have had Jerrett Allen or OG Anunoby.  WIth 26 we drafted Swanigan when we could have had Kuzma, Derrick White, or Josh Hart.    This was the last draft where we had any serious draft capital.  We got lucky with GTJ in 2018 (again, Olshey's people are good at evaluating guards).  2019 was thin late in the draft (though we might have been able to trade up a few spots for Clarke or Thybulle).  No FRPs in 2020.  Going into 2017 with 3 FRPs and walking away with basically nothing is the biggest source of Portland's problems right now.  Much more than coaching on a team that really only has 2 playable forwards."
Donovan Mitchell too the young generation is classssss
Donovan Mitchell and gobert might be a better example but I get your overall point.   I agree about the ring in SA but that‚Äôs where he built his defensive reputation and became the klaw
This list is kinda hilarious.  GOAT  GOAT  HOFer  Donovan Mitchell
"Look at Donovan Mitchell. He had ankle sprain in mid April, returned and  kicked Grizzlies‚Äô asses."
"Markelle Fultz, Lonzo Ball, Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell.  Anthony Bennett (out of the league), Victor Oladipo (derailed by injuries), Giannis Antetokounmpo (2x MVP and a DPOY), Rudy Gobert (DPOY).  Stephen Curry (still playing at an elite level) and Blake Griffin (now a role player/situational starter). And Curry's older as well."
"everybody's injured we don't make excuses for them like we do for lebron and his bruised cervix  ayton's missed games recently with a knee injury, chris paul hurt his shoulder in game 1 of the series, luka has a pinched nerve in his neck, donovan mitchell has an injured ankle, jamal murray tore his acl, embiid has a torn meniscus and the celtics lost their second best player to a broken wrist."
Nah I‚Äôve seen him hug Donovan Mitchell and Ja in Memphis after losses
[Knock yourself out if you want more.](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=donovan+mitchell+pass++highlights)  Donovan is sick and people did not watch the Jazz this year.
Jokic is winning a MVP.  Donovan Mitchell is a household name in a small market.   CP3 and Booker are household names.  what the fuck are you even talking about
"this is one of the worst lists I've ever seen. Tatum is a 2 way wing who is worse than Kawhi on offense, defense, playmaking and he's 5 spots higher?   Donovan Mitchell is a scorer who is worse at the rim, midrange, three point shooting, and a worse playmaker than Kyrie. And he's 4 spots ahead of him?   oh yeah and then Lebron James at 15?"
I just like Donovan Mitchell I

"The league's young talent is fucking incredible. Luka has more 38+ point playoff games than games with fewer than 38, Donovan Mitchell has multiple 50 point playoff games, Jayson Tatum has had a 50 point playoff game, Jamal Murray has had a 50 point playoff game and now Booker is gonna drop 50 in a series clincher too."

"That is not true, the Donovan Mitchell situation proved it. It‚Äôs on the doctors and the front office to make sure these guys don‚Äôt seriously hurt themselves like KD did"
"Are you dumb, stupid, or both?   You can‚Äôt compare the kinda injury Mitchell has to what AD has   Another thing.... one guy just got hurt not too long ago while Donovan had been out for a while by then"
Donovan Mitchell the real MVP then.
"Donovan Mitchell wasn't either.  Joker, Booker and Mitchell all sustained their performances."
"I went to casino and scanned my bets from yesterday... hit on 3 player 1st fg ticket (Capela, Hardaway Jr &amp; Donovan Mitchell) with fucking +61325 odds.   When cashing it in at the cage it took forever because they ""hadn't really seen a ticket like that""  Just needed to share with other nba fans. Its hard as fuck to get 3/3 1st fg of game"
&gt; I mean a med guy can‚Äôt force a guy to sit right?   Yes they can.  It just happened with Donovan Mitchell first game of their series.
devin booker is younger than donovan mitchell and ben simmons
What did Donovan Mitchell and the Jazz organization do to them ?
"Remember when Rudy Gobert rubbed a microphone as a slap in the face to everyone who took covid seriously, simply because he thought covid was a hoax?..  Donovan Mitchell remembers."
Donovan Mitchell going Super Saiyan in round 2
Clearly some of you don't pay attention to nba players Twitter. Donovan Mitchell has liked almost every negative or ridiculous things said about him or the team. Dame isn't leaving until I hear it from his own mouth.
"It'll be Ja, Luka, Trae, Zion. I am a firm believer that Donovan Mitchell is the next great SG and will become the face of the league for a couple of years. He has the potential to be great. Karl Anthony-Towns is another player that I believe will take the league by storm soon.  For a big man, he has such fluid movement on the perimeter. I remember his first game against the Nets this season or last season, he was taking step back threes and hitting them. He's the third best center in the league behind Embid and Jokic.  Also Jayson Taytum is a bad man, but we already know what he brings to the table. He's a young Melo."
"Donovan Mitchell is very fun to watch, and so is obviously LeBron, Book, Kawhi, Doncic, Jokic, Dame‚Ä¶ every west team right now would make a very entertaining finals, the ratings for 2019 finals of an injured Warriors vs Raptors were also pretty great, and the 2020 finals were 2 big markets and still pulled a stinker in ratings so apparently not many people share your mentality."
Luka for sure  Kawhi is only 29 and he's been load managing pretty well to the point where he'll probably stick around for another 5-10 years  Biased but RJ is only 20 and has shown flashes of star level potential (and keep an eye on Immanuel Quickley)  Donovan Mitchell will be a superstar
Donovan Mitchell is a classy guy.
Where's Donovan Mitchell?
Well Giannis and Donovan Mitchell are both boring as fuck compared to other stars in big markets so that‚Äôs a start
"The 2018 draft class is looking like it's gonna be a historically great draft class, like 2003,  or 1996 if players like Luka, Trae and Ayton continue on their current trajectories, not to mention guys who can totally make an All-NBA team like MPJ. To put it in perspective, Luka already has as many WS as Donovan Mitchell and he's been in the league for a year shorter. Donovan is no chump, he's a fantastic player and an All Star, Luka is just that fucking good.   Every draft produces a couple stars and some solid role players. But 2018 is ahead of schedule and looks like they're just getting better."
"The Clippers are better than Utah, Denver and Phoenix. Idc what kind of take this is, but it doesn't deserve the amount of upvotes it's getting. We have guys that can step up but LAC isn't double teaming Luka like in G1 and G2.   If Dallas wins on Friday, it's a cakewalk to the finals with Brooklyn. Chris Paul and Booker can't stop Luka. None of those three teams can stop Luka. If Kawhi and PG can't stop Luka, noone can.  Also, Donovan Mitchell is an all-star but Luka is a superstar. Jokic doesnt have as good a team as Luka with Murray out. No West team can beat these Mavs except LAC."
"I fucking love Donovan Mitchell, no pause."
"Luka's incredible ability to get inside vs Gobert's all-time-great rim protection will be an incredible matchup. Whoever wins that probably wins the series (unless Donovan Mitchell goes super-saiyan, which isn't out of the question.)  Of course, the Mavs may deny us this great matchup by simply going five-out and trying to pull Gobert to the exterior. This would be a very chessmatchy series."
Sure but Donovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray we're dropping 50/game in the bubble...I think most people look at much of what happened in the bubble as a really weird set of circumstances with no fans. It just wasn't the same as a normal playoffs.
Donovan Mitchell &lt;3
"There‚Äôs still a solid difference between Donovan Mitchell and the tier of players that are ‚Äúlike Luka.‚Äù That‚Äôs Dame, Jokic, Embiid, Giannis, etc. Their presence impacts the entire court.  Utah‚Äôs strength is in their team. Mitchell is the steadying ship for scoring when needed. But Conley, Ingles, Gobert, Royce, Bojan, Clarkson are just all such good players."

&gt; Donovan Mitchell #8  RESPECT!!!
"Lebron is also a massive draw in the north east of the USA. His playoff games regardless of opponent or team he's on, have been the most watched games over the past 15 years.  Donovan Mitchell and Giannis do not have that draw.  I don't disagree. But market size is why these teams don't get talked about. You need something like a Lebron or a KD, for a small market team to be talked about by ESPN."
"It's a problem that seems pretty unique to the NBA. Like nobody complained about a Tampa Bay vs Kansas City super bowl, but it seems like the NBA is obsessed with large markets. I think it comes down to the fact that your average NBA consumer knows who Lebron, Curry, KD, etc. are and as a result are more likely to tune in, but might not be as interested in like Donovan Mitchell vs Joel Embiid"
"Imagine this team with Nurkic, Beasley, Grant, and Donovan Mitchell. All the players Nuggets gave away for nothing, so now we have to do imagining."
They‚Äôre down 2-1 to the best team in the west this year. Gotta make it out of the 2nd round first. Donovan Mitchell has been an animal in the playoffs.
"Luka, Donovan Mitchell, and KAT"
Donovan Mitchell is life
"The commentary around Donovan Mitchell the last few days has been hilarious, saying he's the best Jazz player ever. Now a player who is actually better than John Stockton is CP3."
Donovan Mitchell really copied Cameron Payne's free throw routine.
If we're going by playoff sample sizes than Donovan Mitchell is the best player in the NBA.
Yeah and Donovan Mitchell is better than Kobe.
LOL. Idiots injured their own player and you are happy about it. Ask Donovan Mitchell if teams can tell players ‚Äúno‚Äù. Idiot
this is 100 percent correct. similar issue with donovan mitchell.   always having high impact landings as a short guy with huge air time around the rim.
Donovan Mitchell is up there
Donovan Mitchell
"Sorry to be a buzzkill, but a lot of people's averages go down later in their career because they get older, get less minutes, etc. etc.  Donovan mitchell is 24 which actualy *benefits* him for stats like this. Still an impressive scoring average and it's cool that he's by far the most successful playoff scorer at his age currently in the league, but i'd be more interested to see a stat like this that compares every player of all time at age 24/25."
"The Bucks have a starter out that no one brings up. He‚Äôs not Harden but injuries in the playoffs are a thing. Donovan Mitchell, half the Nuggets roster, Anthony Davis, Ibaka, Embiid has been in trouble.    Also the big 3 in Brooklyn have never really been able to stay on the court together."
Saw the same thing when Donovan Mitchell ran into PG at the end of the Clips-Jazz game. People legit seem to think if someone gets injured on a play that means it was done intentionally.
yawnis is my favroite non rocket. him and donovan mitchell.
"Local Utah sports radioman Gordon Monson tried to nickname Donovan Mitchell ""Donovamitch."" Absolutely dreadful. I think he makes his money being the cringeman so his partner can make fun of him, though."
"Yesterday Jazz offense struggled because they don't need a ""focal point"", they need five threats. That's precisely what Gobert provides, the ability to have four decent shooters and his own gravity as a roll man.  Somebody mentionned Portland higher in this thread, this is exactly it. Donovan played yesterday as if he were in Dame's situation and had noone able to score a bucket. Obviously when he takes 35 shots other have a hard time feeling involved, but this is not what is expected from Mitchell.  He's expected to break the defense, but not necessarily to take the shot whatever the defense does. It's high volume and self created for sure but as a team it's not what the Jazz does the most efficiently. This is why Conley's return is crucial to advance, he's the one who makes the blender possible, the best floor manager.  Donovan has playmaking abilities but is no manager."
There were so many insane and ridiculous performances last year to enjoy. Jamal Murray vs Donovan Mitchell anyone? That one tops the list. Bubble or no bubble that was one of the most insane 1 on 1 match ups that I have seen in NBA playoff history. Period. And it happened in the first round!
"I can't take anyone seriously when they call Donovan Mitchell ""d mitch"""
&gt; Donovan mitchell was also an all star and definitely an all NBA guy.  Mitchell won‚Äôt be named to an All NBA team this year.
"It's fucking beyond me what the hell people are smoking when they said the series was over after the Jazz won 2 close games at home.  The difference between their 2-0 lead or 0-2 deficit is Morris knocking down his open shots, shots that he gets rather reliably.  Here's what people also don't realize. I don't say this to slander Donovan, but Luka is light years ahead of Mitchell as an offensive player. Luka may be one man, but what he brings to an offense, what he can do to torture a defense goes beyond what Utah can perform as a team. I have never seen anything like Luka, where you could guarantee him scorching or breaking down the defense on almost every possession. My God he was playing so unbelievable it actually got into the heads of the Clippers role players where you saw them being hesitant on shots they should take because if they knew if they didn't make their shots, Luka would come back down and torch them."
"He shot 2 of 16, scoring 5 in the final elimination game of his 2018 season. Against a rookie Donovan Mitchell who completely outplayed him.   There‚Äôs no excuse for that, he played bad. And he played bad in 2020 against the nuggets as well"
"I'm glad he's playing well, but what's with the strange ""wow, ya'll so silent now, the apology should be as loud as the disrespect"" comments?  Paul George got outplayed by a rookie Donovan Mitchell in the first round in 2018, scoring 5 points on 2 of 16 shooting in their final elimination game. He then lost again in the first round the following year to Portland in 5 games. and again in 2020, he lost humiliatingly again while up 3-1 in the second-round series.   So it's not really surprising that when they went down 0-2 to the Mavs this year, and again vs. The Jazz, the ""lol pandemic P"" comments roll out. Because he hasn't met expectations over and over, it's warranted.   Wouldn't be surprising to me if the Clippers make the finals, but don't pretend like the last 4 years of PG's career didn't happen."

The only way I could see it being over for the Jazz is if Donovan Mitchell is out for the rest of the series with his ankle injury from last night.
Donovan Mitchell is a dangerous man.      So is Jordan Clarkson.
Donovan Mitchell as seen from above
You guys remember when Magic picked Lonzo Ball over Jason Tatum De'Aaron fox &amp; Donovan Mitchell... smh Gotta call that out
"Donovan Mitchell. Period.  He's breaking some of Karl Malone's playoff records in only his fourth year in the league. Not as good as a passer as D Will, but much better scorer.  One national media member has already said he's the best Jazz player ever, even though Mail made 11 All NBA first teams and two MVPs.  Only person with more is Lebron, if I'm not mistaken. That's a bigger accolade and conversation than ""better than CP3.""  Love me some prime D Will though. Was sad that team got broken up."
"I still maintain that Kawhi Leonard is the best player in the series, even though I acknowledge Donovan Mitchell is playing way better through three games."
Today SAS said Donovan Mitchell is the best Jazz player of all time.
"Donovan Mitchell, no question."
Donovan Mitchell
"Donovan ‚ÄúAD‚Äù Mitchell, lol"
It‚Äôs cool. My bad for the name calling. Jazz are my #2 team (but I don‚Äôt want to face a healthy Donovan Mitchell).
KAT ANT DLO.  Ant has potential to be a young better Donovan Mitchell next season
Clippers are generating more open 3s in this series. Just haven‚Äôt been hitting them until today. It‚Äôs a make or miss league.   Kawhi is the best player in the series. And Donovan Mitchell isn‚Äôt 100% healthy. I think the clips complete the 0-2 comeback.
"Can we appreciate Donovan Mitchell for a moment here? First quarter was scoreless (first for him in a playoff game ever), and then absolutely turned up the rest of the game until he got injured. Dude is on his way to be a superstar.  Shoutout to Kawhi and PG on some great performances for the win too."
"I enjoy watching the Los Angeles Clippers play basketball. They are my favorite NBA team.  When they score a basket, I think to myself ""yes"".  When Donovan Mitchell is within 91.86 feet of a basketball, I think to myself ""no""."
Speedy recovery to Donovan Mitchell!
Please dont discuss this because there is no debate for Donovan Mitchell to be the best player in jazz history
Might as well keep Donovan Mitchell out. You‚Äôre not coming back from 20 down with 5 minutes to go
Donovan Mitchell is trying to sell Quinn on Dogecoin

See the problem is that we got Dunnavin Mitchell starting this game. We need Donovan Mitchell back.
Need to find a way to get Donovan Mitchell scoring more than 0 pts and the Jazz got a chance
"It's Donovan. Watch a podcast, people. Deron Williams has gone out of his way to Mitchell is better than he was, and that's not a Deron Williams thing to do"
Donovan Mitchell missing the tough shots he was making in games 1-2 is going to make a BIG difference.
He shouldn‚Äôt be getting swept in any series where he is clearly the best player in that series. Get a clue man. There‚Äôs no scenario where getting swept by Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell is acceptable especially when they are missing their starting point guard.
Well my money is literally on Donovan Mitchell and the Jazz to continue the streak.
&gt; this current Jazz team?  I mean we already have current Donovan Mitchell so if you pick D-Will you get both
Donovan Mitchell is so damn good. I would love to see his progression throughout the next couple of years. One of my favourite players in the league today.
"Really? I don't know if momentum is all the clips need with Donovan Mitchell singlehandedly scoring as much as both the Clippers allstars.   I think the Clippers win tonight by virtue of it being very difficult to win 3 straight playoff games against an NBA team, but I don't think that sways the series in either direction."
"we have Donovan Mitchell playing like a superstar, how is this boring to you?"
Aren't you the dude who said Donovan Mitchell was better than Giannis
"What are the qualifications of a superstar precisely?  Individual awards a 3x DPOY has to be getting close.  Donovan Mitchell also has the second highest scoring playoff loss (after Jordan's 60) in playoff history-  something he managed in 11 minutes less playing time than the GOAT.  I'm not saying Mitchell and Gobert are superstars but it's becoming a progressively harder claim to refute...Like I'd take Tatum over Mitchell were I designing a team ground up for sure-  but accolade wise (the best player on an already elite team, especially in the playoffs) Hell Mitchell has certainly delivered more greatness than anyone else from his class.  Luka is the only young player who might have more to show- but shit.  He's basically the Mavs ONLY option and reaps said benefits.  Mitchell is surrounded by high quality pieces and *STILL* sets records.  I dunno they're the top 2 players under 25, and besides Tatum it's not even close."
No way that it isnt Donovan Mitchell...right?
"Oh stop: They said that about Steph Curry, James  harden, Trae young , etc. Offense and defense are not equally weighted. YES, talent = scoring. Especially in today‚Äôs game.   One of the best defenders of his time (Kawhi) can‚Äôt stop Luka Doncic or donovan Mitchell from averaging 40 a game. It‚Äôs a different game my man. I can call for a screen and get the matchup I want. There‚Äôs a handful of defenders who supercede that and can still make an impact‚Ä¶.Mikail Bridges is not one of them btw"
"Jazz. The Clippers are in yet another series where the star PG(or in Luka's case point-forward sort of) is dominating the Clippers. Luka was the best player in that Dallas/Clippers series, and so far, Donovan Mitchell has been the best player in this series. I think the Clippers might be out of gas. On top of Mitchell, you've gotta find an answer for the DPOY. Maybe Kawhi can match Mitchell, but I don't know who else on that team is gonna be able to neutralize Rudy. Had a ho-hum Game 1, and came back and showed out in Game 2. 12 points, 20 boards, 2 steals, AND 3 blocks? Good luck with that is all I can say. Rudy is a problem, a problem I'm not yet convinced Deandre Ayton can solve, assuming the Jazz sweep the Clippers(sorry Nuggets fans, that shit is wrap. Jokic can't do it alone)."
Jazz 110 - Clippers 102   Donovan Mitchell gets 40+ points   Paul George gets between 20-25   Kawhi gets 28-35
Anthony Edwards (Ego) Joe Ingles (Aussie Dad) Stephen Adams (NZ/Teddy Bear) Giannis Antetokounmpo (Sincerity) Donovan Mitchell (Smile)
"&lt; 6'2 Donovan Mitchell and Damian Lillard have the 2nd (57 pts) and 3rd (55 pts) most points made in a playoff loss *EVER.*  Lol, behind Michael Jordan's 60.  What's even more absurd is that Mitchell pulled that craziness in 11 minutes less playtime than Jordan and 10 minutes less than Dame.  6'6 is no doubt the magic number but exceptions very much exist and it's happened literally within the past year.  3-pt era yadi yada but those two are still regular height humans.  (wingspan + hands different story üòÜ)"
Is luka really in a league of his own or is clippers defense overrated given what donovan mitchell is doing to the clippers now
Donovan Mitchell: 30/4/4
There‚Äôs a separate prediction thread to wager tokens on Donovan Mitchell.
This is where I‚Äôm going to put my prediction that Donovan Mitchell goes off for 50 points
I'm going jazz this one. Donovan Mitchell playing like he should be the MVP. Joe Ingles and Jordan Clarkson both 6th men of the league. Rudy Gobert the DPOY. I don't see clips taking this one. They just don't have enough manpower to stop Mitchell and company.
"I think this will be the one game this series where Donovan Mitchell has an inefficient shooting night. I also don't expect Conley to come back, and I think Morris will have his best game of the series. Clippers win this one, but if Conley is back today, then it gets interesting."
"obviously the Jazz, dude. Donovan Mitchell is better than Steph Curry."
Donovan Mitchell can't keep destroying the Clips like this. He better save some 40 point games for the Conference Finals.  I got Clips tonight but Jazz for the series.
"Every single other player in the NBA DOESNT get that benefit of the doubt is my point. You just have a victim complex on this. Devin Booker (and Donovan Mitchell) are getting attention as the best players on their team, when they aren‚Äôt even that."
1. Mike Conley 2. Mike Conley 3. Mike Conley 4. Mike Conley  5. Donovan Mitchell
CP3? DPOY? Donovan Mitchell? Devin Booker?   You ain't a NBA fan.
"&gt; but the lack of superstar talent is bumming me out for this series  * gobert is a 4x DPOY * CP3 has like a 25:1 assist to turnover rate at 36 * Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell are two of the biggest scorers in the game  what the fuck do you mean no superstar talent lmao  they might not be superstars yet, but they have the talent and they'll get there. this is the series that will push them further"
"Unlike Karl Malone, Donovan Mitchell isn‚Äôt kidding around"
Donovan Mitchell  Mike Conley  Rudy Gobert Joe Ingles  That's 4  Bojan Bogdanovich is borderline.
Donovan Mitchell
"1. Nikola Jokic 2. Derrick Rose 3. Jimmy Butler  4. Giannis 5. Joe Ingles         Joker is fresh on my mind after the game but I tried to avoid putting on the really really young guys like Trae Young and Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker excetera, as far as Joe Ingles I like the what can I say lol"
The new rivalry of the future is Donovan Mitchell vs Devin Booker.
"The 13th pick is always an interesting one, too. Karl Malone (1985), Jalen Rose (1994), Kobe (1996), Zach LaVine (2014), Devin Booker (2015), and Donovan Mitchell (2017).   Also some recent guys with decent careers so far, from Ed Davis (2010) to Markieff Morris (2011) to Kelly Olynyk (2013) to Tyler Herro (2019).  Fair share of duds though, with Papagiannis (2016), Kendall Marshall (2012), Jerome Robinson (2018), and most of the 2000s picks save Richard Jefferson and Thabo."
I think the 76ers have shown that Trae needs to really hit the weight room this off-season.  He's unable to fully penetrate the way Donovan Mitchell can and it really hinders his ability to be effective since they switch on every screen taking his three away then funnel him into Embiid who his only option against is a floater.  That or he needs to develop his mid-range.  HIs passing is still great although he definitely got baited quite a bit due to his ineffectiveness being able to score in the paint.  I can't see the Hawks coming back unless Trae has an insane game from deep.  Series definitely feels over at this point.
Not sure if I should go for suns or jazz  Suns: Beat the Lakers if they become champions losing would not be bad.  Jazz: They got Donovan Mitchell who is super like able. Also Joe Ingles
Donovan Mitchell vs Devin Booker    #BOOK IT!!!!!!!! (STEPHEN A. SMITH VOICE)
"This is what makes Donovan Mitchell a superstar. The dude gets better in the playoffs. It‚Äôs unreal how he can kick it up another notch under pressure, not a lot of players can do that."
Conley coming back into a rhythm and Donovan Mitchell still yet to get into his. The Jazz will be fine.
"I agree hes definitely not worth the contract, and his defense is more limited than people think, but I also think its possible to justify the contract from a business point of view, because the jazz get to basically pick between 3 shit options because they havent pulled a top tier plater in a trade or free agency since fucking 1979.  They either pay Rudy, get fuck all for trade value, or get nothing when he walks. At least this way theyll sell some tickets and make the playoffs for the next 4 or 5 years. They wont be great, they wont win a ship, but the owners at least will have a reasonable product they can roll onto the court.   I agree its going to be an albatross of a contract on a mediocre team,  but its not like they were going to get better by trading him, and if they try a rebuild theyll be basically guaranteed to lose donovan mitchell in the next couple years. Theyre stuck in a shit situation."
"&gt; Both Russell and Kareem are greater than Shaq.  Greater? Sure, but if we are talking better in their peaks it is debatable.  This isn't hating though, Rudy Gobert isn't worth the contract he was given and the Utah Jazz won't sniff a championship paying him and Donovan Mitchell 200+M. Shaq's point is pretty simple, if you can't score 25+ while playing 35 minutes every game, then you aren't a dominant big man and that's true.  The Jazz payed Gobert because they felt they had no choice, not because they think he is worth this kind of money, Utah's best chance right now is Mitchell becoming an MVP candidate, otherwise they will be stuck in first/second round hell for 5-7 years.  Rudy Gobert is the Trae Young version of a big man, dominant on one side and garbage on the other, the difference is that Trae is a ball handler and is dominant on the more important side of the floor."
"To not waste more gas with you since you are quick to dismiss reality, Utah will remain a perennial 6-8 seed whose realistic objective is to get to second round. This is the squad that you will call ""full of difference makers"".  Jrue Holiday (a reserve all star just like Donovan ""Kobe"" Mitchell) Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis as well as Paul George and Chris Paul were all traded for Role players and that's just in the last two years.  I would've gone for Chris Paul, or Jimmy rather than the corpse of Mike Conley when they had the chance.  If going to the second round to lose 8/9 games is what you call doing more, I'm intrigued to see what you call doing less.  I take it that this year ""since they have Bogi"" they'll win two games in the conference semi finals and pat one another in back ."
your coach att really wanted Donovan Mitchell iirc
"I see where you're coming from, but say that player takes Donovan Mitchell completely out of the game, scoring wise. Jazz whole offense gets thrown off."
*Mitchell gets blocked*  ‚ÄúDonovan lost the handle and the timing was off on that layup‚Äù
"According to BasketballReference, he had the exact same Win Shares per game as Jimmy Butler, and way more than Donovan Mitchell. Do you think Jimmy Butler contributes to winning?"
Donovan Mitchell isn‚Äôt good enough to be a first option lol
"Chris Paul is one of the best point guards in the league. In fact, I think you could argue he's the 3rd best right now. But when I say elite, I mean a guy that can be the best player on a realistic championship team. That's LeBron, KD, Kawhi, Harden, Curry, and Giannis. Then you've got the next tier of guys like Jokic, Lillard, AD, and Luka. Then your 3rd tier stars like Paul George and Embiid and Tatum. And then finally you get to your CP3 tier with Donovan Mitchell, Ben Simmons, Kyrie, Jimmy Butler and Bradley Beal. 2011 Dalls was a seasoned playoff team full of strong veterans and a relatively recent former MVP. This Suns team is just nowhere close to those Mavs, and they haven't played a game in the playoffs."
Yup. He was adjusting to a new system last season and was plagued with injuries. He looks like his old self now and has actually been playing better than Donovan Mitchell.
Best TS% off drives so far (min 15 TSA):  Dame Lillard - 72.3  De'Aaron Fox - 72.2  Luka Doncic - 69.3  Bradley Beal - 69.3  Kyle Lowry - 67.6  Kawhi Leonard - 67.2  Worst:  Ben Simmons - 32.2  Marcus Smart - 34.4  Russell Westbrook - 35.1  LaMelo Ball - 38.3  Donovan Mitchell - 40.0
bro the whole list is just a walking L. Like just stop. No ones even gonna argue with you cause who in their right mind believes Jamal Murray &gt;&gt; Trae and Donovan Mitchell
"Ight i‚Äôll give it a go..  Devin Booker Trae Young Jaylen Brown Donovan Mitchell Jamal Murray De‚ÄôAaron Fox Ja Morant  I think Young &amp; Booker are 1a and 1b honestly, and I like Brown for MIP and All Defensive nods this year."
1. Trae Young  2. Donovan Mitchell  3. Devin Booker  4. Jaylen Brown  5. Jamal Murray  6. DeAaron Fox  7. Ja Morant
\- **Trae Young**   \- **Devin Booker**   \- **Jaylen Brown**   \- **Ja Morant**   \- **Donovan Mitchell**   \- **Jamal Murray**   \- **Deaaron Fox**
"First 5 games last year, Jokic averaged 15 pts on 47%, 21% from 3.  He ended the year averaging 20 ppg on 52/32 splits.  You are right that the numbers will change, but there's no guarantee they will go down necessarily.  I imagine they will, but using that Siakam example as evidence is just cherry-picking because there is plenty of other players whose stats go up.  I imagine Donovan Mitchell and Luka will be in that category this year."
"Devin Booker, Trae Young, Jaylen Brown, Ja Morant, Donovan Mitchell, Deaaron Fox, Jamal Murray.  Though these guys are so young this list can easily change in one season."
In my opinion:  1 - Devin Booker  2 - Trae Young  3 - Jaylen Brown   4 - Donovan Mitchell   5 - Ja Morant  6 - Jamal Murray  7 - De'Aaron Fox
Donovan Mitchell
Wasn‚Äôt Donovan Mitchell player comparison Norman Powell or Monte Ellis?  I think that Russ came into the league as a defensive specialist iirci  Gilbert Arenas is a good one too
better than donovan ‚Äúfirst round exit‚Äù mitchell
"Top 20 is tough.  LeBron, Giannis, Durant, Kahwi, Harden, AD, Doncic, Jokic, Curry, Kyrie, Lillard, Embiid, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum and Rudy Gobert are imo clearly above him. If Chris Paul is still the player he was last year then he's on that list as well. That's seventeen players.  Then you've got a group of Donovan Mitchell, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, Karl-Anthony Towns and Bam Adebayo who are also above him in my opinion. That takes it to 22 already.  Khris Middleton, Ben Simmons, Jamal Murray, Zion Williamson, Trae Young, Siakam and Porzingis would be my next tier. That's where I see Sabonis.  He's imo a top 30 player."
"For some reason Gobert draws plenty of criticism, Mitchell is stated to be the best player on the team, yet when Donovan has games lile these, no one comments."

Right on the edge of Top 25 actually. Sports Illustrated had Millsap at #34 and Horford at #25 for 2014-15. And for 2020-21 SI had Donovan Mitchell at #23 and Gobert at #16
"&gt;A #25 ranking That would mean that the average NBA team has a better player than Donovan Mitchell. Do you really think that?  Not necessarily.  Some teams, believe it or not, have multiple good players."
A #25 ranking That would mean that the average NBA team has a better player than Donovan Mitchell. Do you really think that?
"Hawks didn't have anyone close to Donovan Mitchell on that squad. Their top pts per game player was Paul Millsap at 16 pts a game. Also, they played in a weak Eastern Conference. Jazz are doing this in the West."
"You lost me at ""great GM"" with Olshey.  He's incredibly high variance, his moves are either great or utter trash fires.  He's out of consideration given how badly the 2016 FA class went for the Blazers, I'm sorry but there's just no way that a guy who gave $200M to Moe Harkless, Allen Crabbe, Meyers Leonard and Evan Turner is in the conversation given the competition out there.  Also, his draft record is spotty at best, trading 3 picks to move up &amp; take Zach Collins ahead of Bam Adebayo, Donovan Mitchell, John Collins, OG Anunoby and more disqualifies him."
TJ Warren? Donovan Mitchell? There‚Äôs plenty of examples of guys performing way above their averages in the bubble.
"Donovan Mitchell set records for points scored in a Playoff series last year against the Nuggets. I believe he averaged 36 points a game. Just because he doesn't have to go God Mode all the time as he has a fantastic supporting cast, doesn't mean he can't turn it on when required. Also, Gobert is a 2x DPOY, most likely 3X DPOY after this year. Being the best defensive player in the league is a superstar defensively."
If the jazz could get James harden for Donovan Mitchell they‚Äôd do it 10/10 times. Stupid argument
Can I get Emoni Bates AND Donovan Mitchell?
First one because you had me at Donovan Mitchell then lost me on Duncan Robinson
"If they had quality teammates, they wouldn't need to put up those jacked up numbers.  I mean according to r/nba Donovan Mitchell has no teammates in the top 30 and has the best winning percentage in the league right now and isn't even in the top 10 of MVP consideration."
I‚Äôve always liked Henry Ellison‚Äôs game. The guy just never caught a break. But Detroit ruins everything. Detroit drafted Stanley Johnson and Luke Kennard over Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell. And There has to be a spot for James Young somewhere.
Yo on the fr fr? Draymond be spittin str8 FAX bro.   I hope Inside replaces that BULLY Shaq with him ASAP. Maybe Dray can come do TNT on his off nights. Sure Draymond is a donkey and one of my least favorite players ever who openly kicks and punches people in the balls and antagonizes teammates but he‚Äôs not a BULLY who takes out his childhood trauma (from his EVIL DRUG using father) on poor widdle Donovan Mitchell!
Kind of like a D wade/ Donovan Mitchell
"It's been fun, but I still see major flaws that might become more glaring in the Playoffs:  1) Though their defense is solid against most teams, superstars usually go off against them, especially big guys. If Ben Simmons did that, what would Bron do?  2) Donovan Mitchell has been too inconsistent this season. They need last year's playoff Donovan Mitchell to really be legit in the postseason, and I'm not seeing it so far.   Plus, Bogi has been uber-inconsistent this season as well. I imagine that teams like the Lakers and Clippers will hunt Clarkson on defense, so they're going to need their main stars to show up on a consistent basis."
Donovan Mitchell. Plays the game the right way.
"Best player on his team?   I mean...... Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Mike Conley...... I get some sensationalism, but this take is... it‚Äôs bad.   He‚Äôs instant buckets sure, but to say he‚Äôs the best player on his team is absurd."
"i don‚Äôt think i understand your reasoning   you think you should shoot a higher percentage when everybody on the other team knows you‚Äôre the best player AND everybody knows you‚Äôre going to try to score every time you touch the ball?  the reason his shot selection is better is because he doesn‚Äôt have to be the man on ball 24/7 and he can relocate to get easy shots. his catch and shoot frequency went from a quarter of his jump shots to a 3rd and he stopped taking a ton of pull-ups   Donovan Mitchell does more for JC than Quinn imo     but even still, JC is the biggest reason for JC‚Äôs success"
Everyone does that with Donovan Mitchell too. THEY CAN'T HAVE HIM HE'S MINE! ALL MINE!!! *runs away crying
"Is his name Donovan Mitchell, did the highest paid center ever allow jokic and Ben Simmons to drop a 50 and 40 ball on his head?"
There‚Äôs some during the season and during the offseason. Donovan Mitchell just won the Offseason one which is why I know
I think the biggest difference is the Hawks team didn‚Äôt have a star like Donovan Mitchell.
so even without gobert the jazz would still have a much better record than the bulls in the west? led by donovan mitchell? exactly
"That might be because Donovan is a more popular player and his best playoff moments are highly memorable (popping off vs the Nuggets, taking out the Thunder as a rookie) while the Bucks are known for their playoff disappointments. In reality, both guys have their share of gems and duds in the playoffs.   The Jazz haven't clinched the best record in the league, so until then Middleton has two more seasons of being the second best guy on the team with the best record. And from watching both of them this season, here are my takeaways.  * Khris is having his best season from an individual standpoint. He's shooting a little sharper, his defense is about the same, but his playmaking has taken a massive leap so far. Their record isn't as good because that's what happens when you trade your depth for Jrue Holiday. A lack of depth is exposing Bud's coaching before the playoffs this season especially since Jrue's missing some time.   * Donovan is about the same, maybe *slightly* better than last season. Maybe a Jazz fan will debate me here, but the Jazz improved so much because Gobert and Conley are playing better than they ever have. Snyder's system is also working to perfection and they're getting the most out of every role player.   * Don't have the time or IQ to articulate everything but Khris is a better shooter, playmaker, and defender. Mitchell is more explosive, a better high volume scorer, and has higher highs. It's quite close but I'd pick Middleton over Mitchell in a vacuum with some confidence."
"Ben Simmons vs Donovan Mitchell, sad that rivalry died down"
bruh how do jazz fans constantly downplay donovan mitchell i will never understand
I feel like he's a really poor man's Donovan Mitchell
"Donovan Mitchell getting halted by longer wings, but there‚Äôs multiple scoring options in the Jazz offense"
"I never had any emotional investment in that RoY award. Ben Simmons is a great player, and was definitely a rookie.  Just saying: Hey I think it's weird the 76ers announcers are literally telling lies about Donovan Mitchell  *shrug*  If that sounds like outrage to you, I dunno.  Quit your job, move to a Q commune? You're ready to believe anything."
We just need to convince him that every player in the NBA is Donovan Mitchell
Ben Simmons is playing like a man possessed.   Donovan Mitchell awoke the beast.
[uhh](https://www.nba.com/news/donovan-mitchell-trolls-ben-simmons-simmons-pre-game-rookie-hoodie)
Why does Donovan Mitchell always look like he‚Äôs on the verge of tears
He's that Zach Lavine/Donovan Mitchell/Anthony Edwards type of SG. Probably a top 5 pick in this draft.   Athletic high volume scorer who can shoot and slash.  Biggest questions will be defense and efficiency in the NBA.
"Nope, not even the week that he averaged 52/6/6 on 62/48/91 shooting splits.  He got snubbed because the team went 0-3 that week (33pt loss, 3pt loss, 5pt loss).  Suns fans were livid, because those losses had absolutely nothing to do with his play.  He had De'Anthony Melton, Dragan Bender, and 2 Rookies (Ayton &amp; Bridges) starting alongside him.  To give an idea, here are our shooting splits in those games if Booker's stats were removed...  * **at Jazz**: 59pts on 19/34 from the field, 5/8 from 3, 16/17 from FT    * *Rest of Team: 33pts on 12/42 from the field, 2/15 from 3, 7/11 from FT*    * *Booker's matchup was Donovan Mitchell, who scored 10pts on 4/14 shooting* * **vs Wizards**: 50pts on 19/29 from the field, 3/9 from 3, 9/10 from FT    * *Rest of Team: 71pts on 24/57 from the field, 11/29 from 3, 12/16 from FT*    * *Booker's matchup was Bradley Beal, who scored 28 on 11/22 shooting* * **vs Grizz**: 48pts on 19/29 from the field, 3/6 from 3, 7/8 from FT    * *Rest of Team: 67pts on 24/52 from the field, 9/22 from 3, 10/15 from FT*    * *Booker's matchup was Justin Holiday, who scored 14pts on 5/9 shooting*"
The Donovan Mitchell hype is getting out of hand.
We (Denver) traded the pick that became Donovan Mitchell so we could get OG later in the draft then he got drafted exactly one pick ahead of us and we ended up taking Tyler Lydon
"Considering what happened in the bubble. Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell going off, Warren playing like MJ, suns goingn 8-0. This was clearly because of the bubble. None of that would of happened without the bubble, including the Heat making the finals"
"I literally watch Jazz games lmaoo Donovan Mitchell is one of my favorite players and I actually like Rudy, I follow him cause he‚Äôs on my fantasy team, but let‚Äôs not cap here, Rudy‚Äôs excellent defense is not enough for me to say he is a better player than KAT. He‚Äôs been in a way better position most of his career than KAT has"
"1. LeBron 2. Steph 3. KD 4. Harden 5. Luka 6. Giannis 7. Jokic 8. Dame 9. Beal 10. Embiid 11. Kawhi 12. Trae   Are all unquestionably better offensively than KG was. From there I think you could make fair debates with guys like AD, LaVine, Brown/Tatum, Booker, Zion, Paul George, Donovan Mitchell, Brandon Ingram. I'd take some of those guys over Garnett offensively but not all of them."
The Denver Nuggets traded Rudy Gobert for a 2nd round pick (Erick Green) and cash considerations.  And then they traded Donovan Mitchell for Tyler Lydon and Trey Lyles.
"My centers are on point this year. Actually, if I can brag, I think my whole team is on point  Wall (pg)  Dejounte murray (pg/sg)  Donovan mitchell (pg/sg)  Vanvleet (pg/sg)  Huerter (sg/sf) (holding until levert recovers)  Hayward (sf)  Kyle Anderson (sf/pf)  Tatum (sf/pf)  Bam (pf/c)  Hortford (pf/c)  Drummond (c)"
"He might have played well, but all that did was delay the inevitable rebuild a few more years. He got us a grand total of 1 playoff appearance and 0 playoff wins. We should have done a full rebuild 10 years ago but instead we kept struggling to make the playoffs every so often which has lead to an all-time NBA record 14 straight playoff losses. We were never able to get any great players to turn the franchise around because we kept getting mid-round 1sts. We also were trying to ""win now"" which lead to decisions like taking Luke Kennard or Donovan Mitchell. I thought the trade was terrible from day one and I turned out to be right."
"Yeah except that's not true at all lmao.  How many playoff series has westbrook won as the best player?  Same as Dame's jersey number.  Could westbrook beat a team led by rookie Donovan Mitchell?  Or could he help KD win a title?  Could be beat a Blazers team in a series everyone thought OKC would win?    My point is, Lillard had one really bad playoff loss against the pelicans.  He got shut down, and he responded by improving his game and going to the WCF the next year.  Westbrook got left by KD, then he lost in the first round to Houston (which is fine, Houston was better) got another star but still lost to the Jazz in the first round, then lost to the blazers in the first round, and then got carried by Harden to a first round win, where he only played 3 games and was absolutely horrendous in those games.  He then followed that performance up by helping the Lakers win the next series while shooting 42/26/54 (no that's not a typo) and this year he's doing his best to help the wizards get a good pick.  Lillards shooting percentages in his awful pelicans series were about the same as westbrooks 2017 series when he won mvp.  Turns out when 3/5 of the last playoff series you've played in fall under the category of ""absolutely and inarguably horrendous"" you get criticism.  Russell westbrook is no longer a good basketball player, and he hasn't been good enough to win in the playoffs in years.  Even mentioning him in the same breath as lillard is mind numbingly moronic.  If we had Russ instead of lillard, we would be in dead last.  The wizards would be a top 5 team in the East with Lillard."
"Great, over-exaggerate and act like PG didn‚Äôt have a good team from 2012-2014 and 2017-now. He has underperformed in every situation he has been in, especially these last few years. I‚Äôm not blaming him for losing to Miami but don‚Äôt act like he hasn‚Äôt underachieved when he‚Äôs been on great teams. 5 points in an elimination game against a rookie Donovan Mitchell? Seriously? Come on man. I understand if you wanna take PG over kyrie but you can‚Äôt act like Kyrie hasn‚Äôt been a more consistent performer"
Donovan Mitchell MVP
If you don‚Äôt like Donovan Mitchell then you don‚Äôt like basketball period
"Due to the NBA's stupid draft rules people think we drafted Donovan Mitchell. We traded our pick to the Jazz and the Jazz had us draft Donovan for them. He was never on our team.  Still a horrible look especially we got stuck with Tyler fucking Lydon after the Raptors took OG right before we were planning on taking him, but at least we didn't have Mitchell and trade him"
Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker need to be al stars. That‚Äôs it
sir The Don is Donovan Mitchell. or Spida. Luka can keep ‚Äúthe matador‚Äù or whatever ESPN gave him tonight on that dumb pregame
"Most people use the Jazz last few playoff appearances as a reference on why you shouldn't take this team seriously. That is a lazy take for people who don't watch the Jazz, except maybe when they play their team.  2 years ago the Jazz lost to the Rockets, yes, but the Jazz roster was Rubio, Mitchell, Crowder, Favors, Gobert. The team looks completely different now. If you just look at last year, it was pretty similar to this year.   The differences: Conley and Bogdanovic have a year of the system under their belt. They are both playing better this year than last year. Bogdanovic missed the playoffs last year. He was the Jazz 2nd leading scorer with over 20 pts/game. It did take him a bit to get going again this year, but he seems to have hit his stride offensively, but is playing better defense this year and isn't a liability. Even without Bogey last year, if Conley's last shot is 3 inches closer, the Jazz beat the team who went to the WCF finals.  Clarkson was a mid-season trade who fit in decently from the start, and is flourishing in this system. He is playing the best basketball of his career and is front runner 6th Man of the Year. He's another shot creator, which Donovan really needed the last couple years.   Gobert is playing the best he has ever played on both sides of the floor. His defense is quite a bit better than the years he won DPOY, and if he continues is a shoe in. His offense has improved also. If teams really force the Jazz off the 3pt line Gobert gets a lot of open dunks, and if they take away Gobert's touches the Jazz find open 3's.  Mitchell has improved as a facilitator, and is benefiting from having others that can create offense on the floor with him. If teams double team him this year someone is open.  O'Neale has improved his defense and 3pt shooting. He guards the best wing players every game, and is starting to generate noise as a possible defensive team award.   Having a good backup center in Favors is huge. Last year when Rudy left the floor the other teams went on runs almost every game. Tony Bradley just didn't develop as fast as the Jazz needed him to. This year Gobert can get some rest and there isn't a huge drop off.   Finally there were reports that Snyder was bored with being inside from Covid, and revamped both the offense and defense to better fit the players that are on the team. They are getting more open looks at the 3pt line, and when you have four 40% 3pt shooters and Rudy inside, it's just a matter of picking your poison.  The only other argument is that teams don't win without a ""Superstar"". I don't know how a Superstar is defined, but I think they have 2 of the 20 best players in the league. Gobert's impact on the game defensively is equal to the best offensive players in the league's offensive impact. I get that defense isn't sexy, but points saved are equal to points earned. I think Gobert is top ten in the league, and possibly top 3-5. Mitchell is also playing as well as almost anyone in the league. His percentages are up in 3pt% and eFG. His pts, rebounds and assists are all up. He isn't far from averaging 25/5/5 with the best efficiency of his career. Now that teams can't double team and shut the Jazz down, in my eyes, takes this team from good to great.   They are a serious contender this year. Will they win the championship? I don't know. But I think they actually could, and anyone dismissing them isn't watching them. That much I know."
"Donovan Mitchell perhaps, although he's not the ballhandler AI was obviously. He's improving in that area though."
"We live in a time where Donovan freaking Mitchell is not considered a marquee star. Come on, fam. Give me one thing Mitchell doesn‚Äôt have that other marquee stars have."
"I can tell you one big difference between the Jazz and those Hawks, Bucks, Raps teams, and its coaching (also notice the common theme of Budd teams overachieving in the regular season and crapping the bed in the playoffs lol). Quin Snyder is a terrific coach and one of the best game planners in the NBA. He's put together terrific gameplans in their recent playoff runs, and the losses have usually been a personnel issue more than anything.   A few other common things I've seen:  &gt; The Jazz don't have a superstar and teams that are legit have at least one superstar.  That could be true, but it might not. We don't really know, but Donovan Mitchell easily could be a top 10 player at some point in his career and it's entirely possible we just don't know it yet. It's true that some teams have won without a current consensus top 10 player, most notably the 2014 Spurs -- incidentally who opposing players and coaches keep comparing this team to, as well as the 2004 pistons -- also comped due to the defensive grit and anchor comparison of Wallace to Gobert. That all said, Mitchell averaged something like 35.5 points (historically one of the best series ever btw) in his last playoff series and lost barely in a 7 game series against a team that went to the WCF.   &gt; This Jazz team has never made it out of the second round, what makes this year different?  Better bench play (Derrick Favors return was an underrated AF move that shored up Utah's biggest weakness -- Utah hemorrhaged points when Rudy sat, and now they don't), Mike Conley playing like his Memphis self, and Healthy Bojan (missed last playoffs against the Nuggets). They were a rimmed three away from going to the second round against the Clippers last year, and that was playing a UDFA rookie as the back up center and no Bojan."
"Another reason I love Donovan Mitchell. Even though it would obviously help his game if he tried to get to the line more, he just keeps doing his thing.  I'm not saying he doesn't try to get to the line on a drive or anything like that, it's part of the game that guys have to take advantage of at least a bit these days.   But he doesn't seem to care about really making that a bigger part of his game a ton, and doesn't jump into guys on his shot like you see a ton of guys do.   I'm sure he's flopped because everyone has in today's game, but I can't really think of any egregious times that I was like okay wtf was that."
Donovan Mitchell does this too.
"I wish I was as sure of that as others on r/nba are, but I'm still not seeing him turn into this Donovan Mitchell caliber player.  But at least it doesn't seem like he'll be a bust ."
Ben Simmons had beef with Donovan Mitchell and now hes about to beef with Gobert  &amp;#x200B;  go get em Ben
"Seeing a lot of comments that this one series was a fluke. Thought I‚Äôd point out that while this was definitely his best playoff series, he‚Äôs always shown brightest come postseason! Donovan Mitchell is #7 All-Time in Playoff PPG with 27.35! Ahead of the likes of Steph Curry, Kobe Bryant, Karl Malone, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, etc. Again, this doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs better than those legends, and he does have a short playoff career, but it‚Äôs enough to qualify for the list and it shows he‚Äôs got the superstar talent."
Probably because we signed the GOAT then traded for another superstar while the Jazz have..... Donovan Mitchell and...Rudy Gober...
"Knicks vs jazz, Donovan Mitchell heartbreaking buzzer beater in game 7 after having a 7 points on 2/15 shooting."
It sucks because Donovan Mitchell literally had a historic playoff series vs the Nuggets. Like Michael Jordan level bullshit. Lost a series because a three rimmed out and now everyone acts like they can‚Äôt hang in the playoffs or something (even though Mitchell beat PG13 and Westbrook as a rookie).  I think the Jazz can definitely make a run in the playoffs and I hope they do to shut up this narrative (a Narrative btw nobody is using for Philly even though they have had similar playoff success the past three seasons).
"I mean, yeah? Nobody disagrees with you. The thing is that there‚Äôs 5 players on the court at a time. I‚Äôm sure the Jazz would love to have Steph or Luka in place of Donovan Mitchell, but the Warriors and Mavs would much rather have the rest of the Jazz instead of the rest of their team."
Donovan Mitchell since last year playoffs has 100% been that ‚Äòguy‚Äô. If you‚Äôre gonna have to baller in your username watch some basketball at least
A) I didn't say it was impossible. B) Neither of those teams had a guy who viewed themselves as a Kobe type figure who puts the cape on and carries. Donovan Mitchell is pretty well established IMO as a guy who will view playoff time as his time to take over. How effective will that be when Kawhi or Lebron are on the other side doing the same thing?

"This makes LeBron, Embiid, and Donovan Mitchell (jk) look deserving.  The Jazz success is coaching and teamwork.  Embiid should get it or Jokic.  Or LeBron..."
"So you didn't say, ""Donovan Mitchell's stat line from the playoffs last season suggests otherwise?""  OK...  Besides that, when people say they lack star power no one is saying the team is devoid of any stardom at all. Star power wise they have Donovan Mitchell, that's it. That's lacking when you look around the league at contenders.  How often are teams crowned champs with one Mitchell level player? How often are teams making deep playoff runs with one Mitchell level player? It's definitely a rarity."
"May not be aberrational relative to the player. Is abberational relative to Donovan Mitchell, as well as Jamal Murray, who are not GOAT tier offensive players."
"I‚Äôm not sure what to tell you. Mitchell outperformed Kawhi in the playoffs last season. Donovan Mitchell averaged 36.3 points, 5.0 rebounds, and 4.9 assists. Do you want me to repeat that? *36.3* points. (Keep in mind that Donovan is 6‚Äô 1‚Äù and has Gobert: he doesn‚Äôt need to rebound.) Kawhi Leonard averaged 28.2 points, 9.3 rebounds, and 5.5 assists.   Is Donovan Mitchell a better player than Kawhi? No. Is he capable of playing like a superstar in the playoffs? Yes. He has and there‚Äôs no reason to think he couldn‚Äôt continue to."
ok now compare donovan mitchell as that guy compared to lebron names and anthony davis or kawhi leonard
"I grew up in Utah in the 90s. I used to waive at the Mailman every day because I just associated him with Karl Malone. I met John Stockton once at a golfcourse when I was 10 and I to this day I can still see the texture of his five o‚Äôclock shadow in my mind. I worshiped them. I still remember being in our neighbors home theatre and watching John Stockton make the 3 over Barkley to take us to the finals - I still watch that clip sometimes just because of how happy it still makes me. I drive past Karl Malone Drive and John Stockton Drive on my way to work everyday, bought my Honda at the Stockton-to-Malone car dealership, and even though I loved every second of The Last Dance, couldn‚Äôt watch the last 2 episodes because the hurt is still too fresh.    Salt Lake City is often described as the hardest city to play in by other teams because our fans are *insane*. We have the passion of a small market that feels like David taking on the Goliath, and we know we can slay Goliath one day. We almost did it. Stockton and Malone almost beat Michael Jordan. We all believed we could, and even though we came up just short, that feeling of reclaiming the glory of the Stockton and Malone days and finishing the job fuels our passion and energy. That emotion lies in almost every Jazz fan; it doesn‚Äôt matter if you weren‚Äôt even alive in the 90s, your parents were and the love they passed to you for the team was created by the Stockton and Malone days.    If Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert stay in Utah, recapture the passion of the 90s, and finally, *finally* , bring us home the championship we‚Äôve all been waiting our whole lives for, they could very well pass Karl Malone and John Stockton as the greatest Jazz men ever. We turn the Delta Center into a 110 decibel rock show every home game because deep down I think we believe it‚Äôs possible."
"Reminds me of this Donovan Mitchell story. He was like *""I went out to eat with \[can't remember who\] then he threw a dagger up and clinched the game and it didn't sit right with me. Now I only hang out with people after the game.""*  The older you get in the NBA prob the less weird it is to hang out before games for some guys."
Not this team man. Donovan Mitchell has the shot creation capability that no one on the hawks or grizzlies had. They also have the best defensive big in the game. I mean I can‚Äôt count Lebron out until Lebron out. Lol
"Donovan Mitchell, DPOY, Clarkson, Ingles, Bogey, Conley, Royce, Favors. Solid"
"Wow, Donovan Mitchell. The Jazz are definitely doing to win the championship now"
Hawks didn‚Äôt have a Donovan Mitchell. And Horford/Millsap weren‚Äôt DPOYs
I love Donovan Mitchell
Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert
"Starters  G: Stephen Curry  G: Damian Lillard  F: Kawhi Leonard  F: Lebron James  F: Nikola Jokic  Reserves  G: Luka Doncic  G: Donovan Mitchell  F: Anthony Davis   F: Paul George  F: Rudy Gobert  WC: Devin Booker  WC: CP3  These are just my predictions, not who I necessarily *think* should make it. For example, De‚Äôaaron Fox absolutely deserves a spot imo, but I think he‚Äôll get the Booker treatment from years past where his team just isn‚Äôt good enough to get picked over guards on playoff teams."
"**Starters**.      - G: Stephen Curry - G: Damian Lillard - F: Kawhi Leonard - F: Lebron James - F: Nikola Jokic    **Reserves**.     - G: Luka Doncic - G: Donovan Mitchell - F: Anthony Davis.   - F: Paul George.   - F: Rudy Gobert.   - WC: Devin Booker.   - WC: Chris Paul.      ----      SGA, Fox and Zion could all make the team over CP3 and I wouldn't complain but I think the winning record for Phoenix deserves to be recognised and both CP3 and Booker have been playing at an All-Star level."
"Donovan Mitchell will have to improve a lot to pass Stockton or Malone. He isn‚Äôt even really on Derons level. He‚Äôs still young though, so maybe."
"I don‚Äôt think so. Their team is doing well but it‚Äôs a team effort with Ayton, Bridges, Booker, and CP3 all contributing almost equally. All 4 are borderline all stars. I think one Suns player will be an all star.    Let‚Äôs say 6 guards make All Star in the west.    Steph and Luka are starters.   Lillard and Donovan Mitchell are no brainer for the reserve team.   Then for the last two spots its between: Booker, Fox, CP3, Shai, Demar, Ja, Shroeder.   I think Fox and Demar should be all stars, but I think Booker and Ja will get picked because they‚Äôre bigger stars."
They have Ben Simmons and Donovan Mitchell tho. Those dudes are All-Stars.
If Donovan Mitchell continues improving and gets close to a championship or wins won he has a chance no? He‚Äôs still pretty young and can keep improving
"You said donovan was definitely their best player but I guess you meant offensively. Rudy is definitely better right now, the dude is a back-to-back DPOY winner, but Mitchell is the franchise's future."
"Says not to be ignorant, assumes I'm from Utah cuz of my flair. I'm a Louisville native so I rep Donovan Mitchell, you don't fucking know me."
"This shows an inherent flaw with the title of MVP if anything. Most Valuable Player of what? To a specific team? To the league? Utah is 21-5 so let‚Äôs say they stay the number one seed and following the logic of this post, Donovan Mitchell should win MVP over Steph, Dame, Luka, Embiid, Jokic, Durant or Harden? Lebron leading the MVP at the 2nd seed only makes since because of his impressive stats compounded with importance to the team more so than their record but that only helps build his case more.   Donovan Mitchell is great but he hasn‚Äôt broken top 5 in most statistical categories so his record alone shouldn‚Äôt put him above some of the previous mentioned names. The MVP needs a more clearly define description before we exclude Westbrook‚Äôs MVP as citation in other MVP cases."
"I'm not necessarily saying it's cut-and-dried. I *do* think record matters. But statistically? Is Mitchell really ahead of Shai or Fox or Zion or Ingram?  What about the Suns? They're the 4-seed, and we haven't mentioned anybody on that team. (And the guy we should mention is Paul, not Booker)  What about the Spurs? They're 1 game out of the 4-seed...what does that mean for DeRozan?   Or if you care less about narrative and team record, Malik Beasley is having a pretty damn solid year, and I can make the  case for him over Mitchell (especially if I have *Conley* over Mitchell.)  Obviously he's hurt *now* but Christian Wood was putting up 22-10.   If CJ had played more games, he'd be clearly ahead of Donovan, too.   and, of course, KAT has missed most of the year (which obviously makes his case a non-starter) but if he hadn't, that would be another guy clearly ahead of Mitchell.   My point is that that phrase (""all star caliber"") should mean something like ""top 25"" not ""top 40""  because only 24 guys get to be all stars.  And it's very possible to be a top-2 seed with just one top-25 guy."
That‚Äôs something at least.  I found myself positively frustrated by the NBA‚Äôs KIA MVP ladder article that came out this week that was all about Donovan Mitchell and then put him and Rudy both in their ‚Äúand 5 more‚Äù section outside of the top 10.
Donovan Mitchell is definitely the best player tbh.
"If GSW makes a push for a top 2 seed then he will be, but otherwise nope.   I'd honestly have Donovan Mitchell as the front runner right now, especially because just bringing that up would piss off Shaq."
They‚Äôre missing that guy that really Steps up his game in the playoffs   no Jazz players Donovan Mitchell playing like prime Jordan doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs that guy
"Nah he's good. Nothing wrong with trash talking. Donovan Mitchell hasn't sniffed a championship, Shaq said nothing but facts."
"15 first round picks, Donovan Mitchell and the rights to his first born"
"I have to wonder how well you remember the 3 games between the Lakers and Jazz last season when you say all of this, because the Lakers absolutely abused Utah all three times last year. None of the games were even particularly competitive. Utah relies heavily on Gobert to protect the paint and on outside shooting. Anthony Davis always pulls Gobert away from the basket, which renders his defense far less effective, and the Lakers are one of the best at covering perimeter shooters. Just look at how masterful they were in the playoffs at absolutely locking down other teams' 3-pt shooting. For Donovan Mitchell the Lakers have a bunch of guys to put on him who are bigger and stronger than he is, in KCP, Caruso and even LeBron if they want to (just look at LeBron's defense against Jamal Murray in last year's WCF). And the Lakers can match his quickness with Schroder, who is also a great defender.   The Lakers weren't built with the Jazz in mind, but nonetheless the Lakers are perfectly equipped to neutralize everything Utah wants to do, and that was painfully evident last season. But on the other end, the Jazz have a *major* flaw when it comes to trying to defend the Lakers, as they have nobody to put on LeBron. They really don't have anyone to guard AD either, as he always roasts Gobert. I mean, [just look at their last meeting if you doubt that.](https://youtu.be/bOLwalTFgCA) The Clippers represent a much bigger threat to the Lakers, IMO (provided Paul George is ever healthy again, of course). I would love it if the Jazz could take out the Clippers in the 2nd round and leave the Lakers to only have to face Utah. That would be a very easy series for the Lakers, IMO."
I was wondering where Donovan Mitchell was and then I remembered that the Jazz have only had 1 game decided by 3 points or less
I mean he can make the play when it's there but he's at his best when his main focus is getting his own shot and letting others run the offense. It's similar to Donovan Mitchell (albeit not nearly as good). One of the bigger improvements he's made this season over last is knowing when to defer to one of our playmakers when he doesn't see a lane to a bucket.
I actually had a class with Donovan Mitchell is college. Super nice guy.
"Jazz got Mike Conley, Donovan Mitchell, Derrick Favors. If only they had rubio still"
What did you think about Donovan Mitchell getting 3 free throws during the final minutes?   I'm talking about the play where Seth Curry contested off to Mitchell's side and Mitchell hip-checked him.
Can always count on Donovan Mitchell shooting less than 40% against the sixers
Case in point: Embiid tonight helping Donovan Mitchell get tossed in OT
No player has a bigger difference between how good they are and how good they THINK they are than Donovan Mitchell
Donovan Mitchell really needs to learn how to keep his emotions in check. How do you get two T‚Äôs called on you in overtime lol
"""Adam Silver wonders why the league is losing money. That's why. People paid good money to come watch these athletes play and [the refs] try to take over the fucking game!"" - Donovan Mitchell probably"
"Devin Booker, and now Donovan Mitchell getting ejected as a result of officials being ass"
Another proof it's Devin Booker AND Donovan Mitchell
Did you see Donovan Mitchell jump into contact and get rewarded with three free throws? What are your thoughts on that?

Donovan Mitchell is going to experience the Benitentiary tonight
- Donovan Mitchell has averaged 20.7 PPG on 35.4% shooting in his 7 game career vs Simmons.       - Joel Embiid has averaged 20.6 PPG on 40.5% shooting in his career 5 game career vs Gobert.       --      Whichever star can change that trend tonight probably does enough to lead their team to victory.
Well I guess Donovan Mitchell is the heavy favorite right
"2017: Took Josh Jackson over De'Aaron Fox, Jonathan Isaac, Donovan Mitchell and Bam Adebayo.   2016: Took Dragan Bender over Jamal Murrayand Buddy Hield, and then proceeded to also take Marquese Chriss over Domantas Sabonis."
"Tell me why LeBron deserves the MVP! If you want to go by team record then it‚Äôs Donovan Mitchell! Jokic is only 3.5 games back, his team has the same net rating, and he doesn‚Äôt lead LeBron in just PPG, he leads him in EVERYTHING, by a wide margin in most cases"
"&gt;So it would be two of Kyrie, Beal, Simmons, Lavine, and Booker for the last two spots.  You forgot Donovan Mitchell in that list. Booker wont make All NBA this season unless he does something spectacular and the others drop off immensely."
"We have had a couple refuse to dunk guys on the Raps (Gasol, Serge for a while, Poetl, Pascal at times) and my god is it frustrating to see them just straight miss it or scream agout being fouled and just lose possession.  Throw the god damn ball down with some authority when you're under the rim, god damn. You're shooting percent goes up like 2 or 3 if you just use some damn ferocity around the rim.  Ayton is huge too, get him into the Donovan Mitchell foundation for NOT GIVING A SHIT about defenders pride"
"People calling him a bust last season didn't know what they were talking about. His first two years were rough, being a young raw prospect that got stashed under MCW with Clifford and had his role jerked around a bit in Borrego's first year as we tried to make the playoffs in Kemba's contract year.   Dude had a pretty good all around season last year after bulking up a lot and making enormous strides as a finisher, becoming a competent defender, and an improved ball handler and passer. But his shot got super flat and he bricked all his 3s. Aside from that he had a really solid season last year. It was pretty clear to me (and others on the Hornets sub) that he'd have a big season if he got his shooting touch back, and this year he has after recovering from COVID.  Is he going to be Donovan Mitchell? No, but that doesn't make him a bust. Even last seasons version of Monk wouldn't be considered a bust, because you expect a quality rotation/6th man level guy from the 11th pick and that's what we had from a 21 year old Malik Monk. He's taking that next step now."

"he shows such interesting and impressive skills and footwork, the problem is the ball doesn't go in as much as you'd like. if he can be a reliable scorer in the ridiculous shots he takes, well, that's why he was a lottery pick. I feel bad for him that he's just ""the guy the jazz traded with the 24th pick to get donovan mitchell"" lol"
"Just so we're clear, averaging 28/6/7 on 58% TS in the playoffs as a Rocket counts as ""not showing up when it matters,"" correct?  I'd hate to see what you think of Damian Lillard or Donovan Mitchell or Jimmy Butler, then. Because they're all worse in the playoffs than Harden."
"Interestingly, the dunk contest has a history of catching a lot of players before their true ascent into super stardom, so it creates this perpetual cycle where it feels like there‚Äôs no stars entering each year only to look back in hindsight and realize there‚Äôs names everywhere.   Just in the last 10 years or so, all-star caliber contestants have included Dwight Howard, Zach LaVine, Victor Oladipo, Donovan Mitchell, Andre Drummond, DeAndre Jordan, Giannis Antetokounmpo, John Wall, Mason Plumlee, Damian Lillard, Paul George, Serge Ibaka, and Blake Griffin."
"Yup. Lavine and AG was great after the fact but Lebron Vs Giannis Vs Donovan Mitchell Vs Ben Simmons would be infinitely easier to market and would probably get more people actually watching the Dunk contest on the night of, instead of in highlight videos the next day."

Donovan Mitchell
"Nope, if you‚Äôd watched it(you clearly didn‚Äôt) you would‚Äôve seen that Ben was guarding Donovan Mitchell who had 24 points on 24 shots.   Hit a nerve here saying Gobert isn‚Äôt a brick wall didnt I. Not only did Ben go for 40 but Dwight also had a season high in points. But alas, the narrative continues!"

Donovan Mitchell is the Jameis Winston of nba passers
Hard to say this when it comes to the playoffs. They are out in the 1st round. Hope that changes tho. I truly believe this year they are the best version with their ball movement. If donovan mitchell can step up even more and perform like bubble murray consistently they have a chance. Superstar + Defensive center + component PG/ Wing scorer and bench depth too.
Dumbass take. Being a legend doesn't mean we have to suck his dick for his commentary. Ernie has never been a pro and has killed it on the show for years. Just because he's good at basketball doesn't mean people aren't allowed to criticize bad takes. If Michael Jordan told Donovan Mitchell he will never be a superstar I would call him a dumbass too
"Its a bit unfair as Simmons is more seasoned than the other 2.  Simmons nets you a problem matchup, a DPOY candidate, and an excellent ball-handler/passer, and size. The configurations you can build around him are gonna be a lot easier to manage than the ones you can build around Lamelo/Morant.   So if I'm building a team from scratch I feel like he solves the most problems....that being said there are a few team configurations i'd choose the other guys over him - but they require a lot more specific personnel - where I'd want a perennial outside threat.   Like lets say Lamelo and Ja continue their trajectory, and you have to replace Donovan Mitchell in Utah... I'm not sure I pick Simmons then."
"I would probably take Fox over Ben Simmons but it's debatable. I think Donovan Mitchell, though, is clearly the best player from that draft."
"‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to be the best team in February; we want to be the best team in July,‚Äù Donovan Mitchell  Who exactly is bragging about winning in February?   Dude‚Äôs a troll"
Any way I could see this breakdown for Donovan Mitchell? I feel like his second half stats are always way better than his first half stats. I'm curious if thats actually true or just my perception.
"The most interesting question to me is whether feats in the bubble can be discredited because of this stat. I know that for some reason, whenever anyone tries to say the what happened in the bubble can‚Äôt be counted as much, it usually means that Lebron and the Lakers didn‚Äôt deserve their title. That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm getting to at all, I‚Äôm talking about all the other anomalies that occurred within the bubble.   It‚Äôs practically unprecedented for the four conference finals teams to be performing this poorly, is that a fluke or can we trust that everything that happened in the bubble was legitamite, and therefore could happen again? It‚Äôs still a very relevant question that can help determine who‚Äôs a contender next year. How legitamite were Jamal Murray‚Äôs and Donovan Mitchell‚Äôs playoff performances? The Jazz are looking like a great team while lacking a top 5 talent, which is vital to winning a championship. Last playoffs, Mitchell certainly looked like a top 5 player, but can he do it again? That defends on if you view feats in the bubble as legitimate or not.   I know that discrediting team‚Äôs accomplishments in any way, shape or form is viewed at as being a hater, but we saw so many players take massive leaps inside the bubble; it just has me curious to whether or not they can repeat this. To tie this back to the post, if the four conference finals teams are just unlucky as of now and will get back to playing like competing teams, then that adds legitimacy to what happened in the bubble, and therefore we could expect certain players like Murray and Mitchell to shine next playoffs."
Yea the Pacers situation is solid. You never know when you get a Donovan Mitchell type player in the mid to late first as well
Kentucky loves the Jazz for Donovan Mitchell
He could eventually have a similar role to Donovan Mitchell. Hybrid/combo guard

Did you watch the series he had against Utah when he played for OKC? Joe Ingles and rookie Donovan Mitchell destroyed him. He actually scored just 2 points in the elimination game 6.
"The fuck are you talking about dude. Jokic in his two seasons of playoffs has been the best players in series that had Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Gobert and Donovan Mitchell."
"does this mean he's going to talk to more guys like he talked to Donovan Mitchell?  Ugh.  I'm a Suns fan and I'm not a Donovan Mitchell fan (because of the whole thing between him and Booker haha), but that was so disrespectful!"
"Ya, the early block and the 2 unnecessary deep threes are what I saw as good defense caused by Simmons on Mitchell.  Another time Simmons went in for a steal, and Donovan used that chance to gather and drive past him.    Past that, it wasn't really a 1v1 Mitchell vs Simmons.  The game felt much more zone-like or switch-coverage."
He gives his opinion. Would you prefer he lie? He said at halftime of that game that he thought Donovan Mitchell needed help. Would it have been better if he changed his tune because they won the game? That would‚Äôve been incredibly phony so he tried to turn into a motivational moment (which apparently didn‚Äôt not work considering how well Utah is playing).
Lebron  Dame  AD  Booker  CP3  Kawhi  PG  Steph  Klay  Donovan Mitchell  Gobert   Jokic  Murray (arguable)  KAT  SGA (arguable)  Luka  DeMar   Ja   Zion  Tatum  Jaylen Brown (arguable)  Kyrie   Harden  KD   Embiid   Ben Simmons   Beal  Russ (arguable)  Butler  Trae Young (arguable)  Giannis   That‚Äôs 30. Doesn‚Äôt even include fringe guys like Lavine or badass rookies like LaMelo.
"Basically if Donovan Mitchell averages 15/3/11 with great efficiency, and Jazz is the only 60+ win team, yeah."
"Overrated: Donovan Mitchell -- guy is an all-star 100%, but media talking heads are trying to get him in the MVP conversation when Gobert or Conley are technically having more consistent and stronger seasons than he is.   Underrated: Jordan Clarkson. He's getting 6MOY hype, but I don't people who don't closely follow the Jazz realize how good he is playing this year. If you compare his PER 36 stats to somebody like Devin Booker, they're actually really similar (Clarkson averaging fewer assists, more rebounds, and more steals, but similary scoring and shooting)."
"Dame-shot 28% from the field   FVV-10 points and 28% from the field   De‚Äôaron-shot below his season average fg%  Donovan Mitchell-shot 37% from field   Harden and Booker had good games, felt disingenuous to not include them"
If you had to swap Donovan Mitchell with another NBA player on a different team who would it be?
" Bron ad giannis embiid jokic dame kd Kyrie harden kawhi luka are all superstars ‚Äî I think the best stars are jimmy butler and Donovan Mitchell , PG, dbook, jaylen brown , cp3 etc Worst stars are Middleton , derozan, draymond etc"
"I say this because the current level of the Jazz is simply not sustainable and the Jazz lack true star power, aka a superstar. Donovan Mitchell/Rudy Gobert won‚Äôt cut it against the likes of Harden/Kyrie/KD, PG/Kawhi with a better team and playoff LeBron/AD with the best defense.   So to think that It‚Äôs dumb to say that the Jazz have the most difficult run out of any contender is just delusion. They are a regular season juggernaut akin to the Bucks the last few years. Could the Jazz win the chip? Sure, but history shows us good regular season teams almost always lose out to the truly elite squads."
Oladipo before injuries. Lavine and Donovan Mitchell seem like the two obvious choices. Maybe Lebron?
"I mean, Donovan Mitchell did win the dunk contest three years ago and is in the 3 point contest this year."
"Drafting Frank over Donovan Mitchell. And he can't use the ""no one knew Mitchell would be this good"" excuse, with multiple people in the FO banging on the table for us to draft him.  Forcing the triangle  Hiring Fisher and Hornecek  Running Melo out of town  The Derrick Rose trade was pretty bad  The aforementioned Noah contract  Drafting KP, and deciding to trade KP when they could have gotten a haul for him were probably his only good moves."
Billy Donovan Mitchell Robinson
Donovan Mitchell can take that leap
"&gt; If ur super smart stats are true then why nuggets is sitting at similar record as warriors?  because basketball is a *team* game and there's 1398492834 other factors? do you think the team with the better player always and forever has the best record? I guess by your logic Donovan Mitchell is better than both of them  &gt; the formula of those advance stats are also unquantifiable  I'm not sure you know what ""quantifiable"" means lol we can 100% quantify the formula....that's how formulas work  &gt; The fact that curry has similar efficiency with jokic should give a massive advantage for curry if u really understand the game lol.  the fact that they have similar offensive production while Jokic is a far better defender should be a massive advantage for Jokic if you really understand the game. Seems convenient your entire case is based on half the game while completely ignoring the other half  &gt; Do u disagree that curry‚Äôs gravity should be taken into account when evaluating both players?  I sure don't. Do you agree Jokic's greater skill as a distributor and defender should be taken into account? it's almost like there's more than just ""gravity""  How about steph's gravity on defense? I'd say there's a far bigger discrepancy there"
The Jazz can‚Äôt win the title. Gobert will get played off the court and Mitchell will try to match a better player on the other side. The roll players will disappear like role players always do. So it‚Äôs Donovan Mitchell vs ‚ÄúStar who‚Äôs better‚Äù
"ESPN: Are girls on Tinder sleeping on Donovan Mitchell, or with him?"
Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert are not top 10 players in the league though. Most of the time a #1 seed destroying teams on a nightly basis like this will have at least one top 10 player on that team. They seem to be a team with just insane depth.
"Lol no he‚Äôs not. If he‚Äôs having a better year than Booker, then Booker has had a better year than Klay, CP3, and Donovan Mitchell over the last 3 years (averaged 27/4/6 on ~60% TS). Winning matters, Booker hasn‚Äôt had to score as much to have a huge impact on winning. Not to mention the case can easily be made that Booker‚Äôs stats are better straight up, not even considering winning."

Lakers feast on you with AD and our german back.  Literally churning out Gobert into a filet mignon. And having a side of Donovan Mitchell as a balsamic vinaigrette salad. Finishing it off with a aged Mike Conley glass of red wine in our bellies.  Feel lucky you false musicians.
"I agree with the gist of your arguement, but dismissing Donovan Mitchell just like that is pretty ridicolous"
[Donovan Mitchell dunking](https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e2fabb98ce5a9c7328f3f920ef9e93cf658663b4/c=0-83-2720-3710/local/-/media/2018/02/17/Louisville/Louisville/636545044558274933-AP-18049133271512.jpg)
Everyone talking about how close Mitchell was but Conley was also only 2 rebounds and 2 assists away from a triple double as well and he got taken out much earlier in the 4th quarter than Donovan did
"Donovan Mitchell, or Rudy Gobert"
"Bradley Beal was inefficient in college, as was Donovan Mitchell, Paul George, and Zach Lavine. I‚Äôm obviously not saying he‚Äôs going to be close to those guys, but he‚Äôs going to be more efficient then he is now. How efficient, I don‚Äôt know and neither do you. It‚Äôs incredibly ignorant to say Ant is the next Andrew Wiggins this early into his career. Just let him atleast finish the season before saying he‚Äôs a bust"
"Obviously I'm not a Jazz fan, but I am a Donovan Mitchell fan. Def rooting for the Jazz in the finals."
"In no particular order.   1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. James Harden   5. Giannis   6. Nikola Jokic   7. Luka Doncic   8. Stephen Curry   9. Damian Lillard   10. Joel Embiid   11. Paul George   12. Kyrie Irving   13. Jimmy Butler   14. Jayson Tatum   15. Trae Young  16. Anthony Davis   17. KAT   18. Rudy Gobert   19. Zach Lavine   20. Bradley Beal   21. CJ Mccollum   22. Chris Paul   23. Donovan Mitchell   24. Domantas Sabonis   Those are 24 guys that are better. I think Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton and some others are better too but that‚Äôs an opinion."
Hahahaha yes Donovan Mitchell is a top 10 player trust me !! Fool
"Based on last playoffs Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell are the best guards since Michael Jordan, Jimmy Butler is on LeBron's level and Anthony Davis is the best mid range shooter in the history of the league by a wide margin. I think we can safely say none of those are true and the bubble inflated offensive performance."
"Seems kind of Hasty to be giving the Jazz three all NBA slots. I mean Gobert and Joe Ingles, yeah. But Donovan Mitchell has work to do."
"No, you‚Äôll have to trade for picks that end up being stars (Jayson and Jaylen picks) or you‚Äôll have to have that young skilled core that can lure another star to the team in the hopes of winning a championship. We have those two guys in place. Now we just need to wait for 2023 when our max spot opens and we can make a potential splash in free agency by getting a high end player who‚Äôs teams have potentially been underperforming due to competition or construction. The big names that year are Embiid and Jokic. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs crazy to imagine the Nuggets not being able to compete due to conference and Jokic moving conferences. I think Embiid 100% stays with Sixers but if they keep having playoff woes after lofty expectations who knows? If we can‚Äôt fill a max that year you could try for 2024 and try to get one of Jaylen Brown‚Äôs best friends Donovan Mitchell on the team. You want young guys to maximize the championship window so these guys are my top picks. By then everyone should be in their primes."
you're on some shit if you think donovan mitchell is taller than 6'1 with shoes on
"Hey, it‚Äôs me NBA player Donovan Mitchell. How‚Äôs the wife?"
"If Donovan Mitchell asked me for my SSN I‚Äôd give it to him, no questions asked"
No lol. No one would take the Jazz in a 7 game series vs the nets. Regular season means very little. Unless Donovan Mitchell ascends to being a top 20 player of all time it ain‚Äôt happening.
In a league obsessed with scoring it's Mitchell.  But Donovan is replaceable.  Gobert is 100% not.  There is no fucking question he's the most important player.  That's why Favors is so critical.  Without Gobert the Jazz don't even make the playoffs.
8/8/8 for Donovan 'Draymond' Mitchell now
Donovan Mitchell
"AND THEN YOU ADD DONOVAN MITCHELL ^^^actually ^^^shooting ^^^well ^^^and ^^^not ^^^like ^^^he ^^^is ^^^tonight TO THE MIX? ~~YOU~~ THE CHANCES OF WINNIN', DRASTIC GO DOWN"
Donovan Mitchell is 100% gryffindor.
i'd have to go with Jayson Tatum and Donovan Mitchell
"You can't say the decline when he's still averaging a triple double just last year and nobody cares anymore. No mvp votes, just the 8th seed in the east... Prime westbrook got bounced by a rookie Donovan Mitchell the following year. His teamate was close to winning mvp(pg13 ) then westbrook triple double as well.   That's what u want me to build my team around as the first option. Rose mvp season is the same season as Miami lebron team."
"Which is why I said barring injury. It‚Äôs not exactly a hot take if you have to say the superstar leading the team *may* suffer a season ending injury thus ruining playoff hopes. You can apply that ‚Äúhot take‚Äù for nearly any team that made the playoffs in the west. For example, the Jazz won‚Äôt make the playoffs if Donovan Mitchell suffers a season ending injury. Like, yeah no shit they won‚Äôt? Not exactly a controversial statement."
"I think sometimes they round heights down also. Like a guy might be 6'4.25"" or 6'4.5"" in his socks and they list them as 6'4"". I think that's how Donovan Mitchell went from 6'3"" to 6'1""."
"Nah, sorry that is bullshit.  I agree that the Raptors most likely don't win if the Warriors dont get decimated.  But last year was a real outlier for playoff team injuries, particularly important/star players.  Just off the top of my head:  Clippers: - Kawhi Leonard (best player on team) out injured  Lakers - LeBron and AD out or dealing with injuries   Nuggets - Jamal Murray, Will Barton, PJ Dozier  Nets - Crippled Harden playing on one leg, Kyrie out.  Hawks - Trae Young tweaks ankle in game three against Bucks  Jazz - Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley out or dealing with injuries.  All the serious contenders suffered injuries to one or more of their most important players.  The Bucks did great and earned that ring. But to suggest that injuries played no part is dishonest rubbish."
Donovan Mitchell will win MVP.
"Not really.  People think he can‚Äôt shoot because of his NBL stats but we should really disregard that now that we have a solid NBA sample size.  LaMelo made more threes his rookie season (92) than he took his entire season in the NBL (80). He shot 48% on 2s last season, putting him in the company of Trey Young, Kamba Walker, and Ja Morant. He shot better from 2 than Donovan Mitchell, Anthony Edwards, Russell Westbrook, Dennis Schroeder, Julius Randle, and D‚ÄôAngelo Russell.  I‚Äôm too lazy to look up his stats before the injury, but if memory serves me correct he was shooting something like a 50/38/80 split. Post injury all his numbers really got dragged down and he couldn‚Äôt hit a three to save his life. Besides him constantly grabbing it every stoppage in play, it was obvious he needed more rehab time on that wrist to get his shooting form back.  But just from watching him, kid has a shooters touch. People hold his janky form against him but the ball goes in and his touch on 20 foot floaters is insane. Not to mention once he slowed down on his free throw routine he started shooting 85%.  Guy is a shooter, I think this next year really shows it."
I'll never forget how this man got knocked out by rookie Donovan Mitchell lmao and is still considered a star because he boxes out his own teammates for rebounds.
"I'd probably put Donovan Mitchell in there, he was the best player on the 1 seed team and averaged some pretty good numbers in the play-offs on an injured ankle. Just a shame the system couldn't adapt."
"Heckling is just part of the game, and always has been.  Donovan Mitchell's even [asked the crowd to yell and scream](https://twitter.com/utahjazz/status/1088347350454611968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1088347350454611968%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkslsports.com%2F404482%2Fmitchell-jazz-fan-combine-to-force-denver-turnover-in-fourth-quarter%2F%3F) at opposing players mid game, and when it happens to him, [he lets his play speak for him](https://www.slcdunk.com/2019/1/6/18170725/donovan-mitchell-pistons-fan-your-fault-you-did-this-utah-jazz-2018).    I dunno, man, this isn't a musical.  This isn't a standup routine.  It's sports.  Getting in the opponents heads is part of it.  If you're gonna have a meltdown because someone makes a jokes about HAIR DYE, not even your actual hair, but the color he CHOSE for it to be, then I don't know what else to tell ya."
"I kind of seeing him going down two potential routes. I think he could potential follow a Brandon Jennings type of path (hopefully minus injuries), potentially a lesser Donovan Mitchell type player. Or I think he goes down the Jordan Clarkson path and he could be one of the best 6th men in the league for a scoring and hustle punch off the bench."
"His passing numbers are fine. He made more passes per game than Ja Morant, marcus smart, donovan mitchell, terry rozier, Jamal Murray lmao. He had as many potential assists as Murray, Lonzo, Dragic... He's not some crazy ball hog."
"clippers were uniquely situated to be elite with a small ball lineup, and with mike conley out and donovan mitchell hurt, it put way too much pressure on a weaker utah perimeter defence. rudy is absolutely not at fault, the result would've been far worse without him on the court. it was things like ingles/clarkson/mitchell getting burned repeatedly on the perimeter, forcing everyone to over-rotate and just miss assignments completely, leading to ridiculous things like the terrence mann 40pt phenom  like if you take rudy out, our ortg that series would've gone from like 120 or whatever to 105, and our drtg would've been the same. we would've lost every game by twenty five or something stupid. imo."
"also I've heard it said many times before but it can't be reiterated enough. We get these players like Luka Doncic, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, etc who become All Star/All NBA guys a few years into their careers and we forget that most guys take years to develop."
"Top 5 Now Steph Curry, James Harden, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Trae Young.  In 5 Years that‚Äôs tough, but I say. Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Cade Cunningham."
How far I had to come down the comments to find Donovan Mitchell‚Ä¶ sad
"Where there is smoke, there‚Äôs often fire. Do you hear rumblings about the Jazz trading Donovan Mitchell? No? Because it‚Äôs not happening so there‚Äôs NOTHING to discuss.  Did you hear the news about the Nets and Kyrie not being able to play? Yeah? Well that‚Äôs because it is happening and there is something to discuss. The ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù are a part of the discussion."
"If Donovan Mitchell contributes more wins to my team than Steph, then yes. Winning &gt; Fancy highlight plays"
"&gt;  injured Donovan Mitchell in round 2  Bro, we didn't play the Jazz....  LMAO  Thank you for proving our point that people doubting the Suns are low information fans."
"LBJ, KD, Giannis, Kahwi, Steph, Harden, Embiid, Jokic, Luka, Lillard - I find it had for him to be top10 goven that he would need to surpass two of the list I just made. Even if you take Kawhi since he will be out most of the season, I can‚Äôt see Tatum being better than Embiid, Jokic or Lillard.  On your point for AD, he was the best player for the Pelicans that swept the Blazers before getting eliminated by the greatest team of all time. Not a #1 option in a championship team, but a #1 option on a team as good as the Celtics were the last two seasons or so. And no team won without a top5 player in the league over the last twenty years or so - except the Spurs in 2014 as you can argue TD was past his prime and Kawhi still wasn‚Äôt that good, but those two plus Manu and Parker and Pop‚Äôs coaching are hard to replicate.  Btw, I would take Butler over Tatum now. His Bubble run was more impressive than any of Tatum‚Äôs postseasons - albeit Tatum is young and very likely to have a better playoffs eventually. I have PG13 and Beal about the same as Tatum in impact on a contender. Gobert and CP3 have a specific set of skills but in a vacuum I would rather have Tatum.  Booker, 2020 Murray and Donovan Mitchell are also worth considering, but I‚Äôd favor Tatum over them all. Oh, and Trae Young is coming."
"Funny thing is, this is literally the best situation he could possibly be in.  He's got a winning team that he doesn't have to be the alpha on, but where the alpha basically doesn't give a schit about that stuff and lets him think what he wants.  He's home, in a big market, with one of the few people who tolerates and seems to kinda like his bs.  Plus, if he disappears for a couple weeks, there's plenty of firepower for the team to win.  There's no other team in the league like that.  Lebron will always be the top dog on the Lakers, Giannis is way too level-headed to humor him, the Warriors would just laugh him out of the locker room, the Clippers have no leadership to keep him on track, he's not going back to Boston, Chris Paul would punch him in the face, he'd be redundant with Donovan Mitchell, the  Sixers are still dealing with their headache player, and the rest of the league isn't good enough to maintain his attention and would need him to be a leader."
Everything said about Ben Simmons can equally be said about Rudy Gobert. But if Snyder and Donovan Mitchell came out and said ‚Äúyeah we can‚Äôt win with Gobert‚Äù Gobert would be well within reason to say fuck that and leave the team.
Because Donovan Mitchell and Zaire Wade is standing in their way.
"Because they got through an injured West last year. No AD &amp; Injured Bron in round one, injured Donovan Mitchell in round 2, injured Kawhi in round 3. They won their first 2 games in the finals, but then Booker got exposed as time went on, and you're relying on Chris Paul to be healthy all the way through to playoffs. They haven't produced consistently enough against healthy opponents yet."
"Team game dummy, you're taking Donovan Mitchell over Steph?"
"https://www.deseret.com/sports/2020/12/22/22193242/utah-jazz-rudy-gobert-contract-extension-nba-donovan-mitchell-ryan-smith  I am trying to understand the numerical logic of not giving centers the max.  &gt; The Utah Jazz gave Rudy Gobert the third largest contract in league history and made him the highest paid center ever when they agreed to a **five-year, $205 million** contract extension Sunday ...  &gt; After being named NBA Defensive Player of the Year twice, Gobert was eligible for up to 35% of the cap (roughly **$228 million over five years**), the same amount that Giannis Antetokounmpo just signed on for in Milwaukee, but Gobert took a discount.  Let me get this straight.  Saving $23 million over 5 years for a $200+ million contract is going to get the Jazz more wins exactly how?  &gt; Looking toward the future, the discounted price that Gobert agreed to does give the Jazz a little bit of flexibility, but it still means the Jazz will more than likely be a luxury tax-paying team once Gobert and Donovan Mitchell‚Äôs extensions kick in next season.  Is the argument that saving about $4 million a year going to help the Jazz get under the luxury tax threshold some year so they can reset it and avoid some sort of repeater tax?  I don't know.  It seems to me it is important to not give the max just as a pride thing for a team to say it didn't give the max."
Dwight making it for sure.  No way loser Vince should make it. Zach LaVine and Donovan Mitchell have already peaked higher lmao
also healthy Donovan Mitchell against the Clippers &gt; prime steph curry
"How are you not getting this?     Are there people who were upset he's not playing?  Yes.  Are there people who are upset that he might now play?  Yes.  Are there people out there who like to shit on ben regardless?  Yes.   There are millions of subscribers each with their own unique set of opinions and people in general like to complain.  Sure, the 3rd category exists but the majority of people are going to be one of the first two.  People tend to not want to discuss things that they don't have strong feelings about.     Another great example of this in action was a few years ago when the ROTY race was heavily debated between Donovan Mitchell and (coincidentally) Ben Simmons.  There were people who claimed that ""the subreddit"" was flip flopping over who they wanted to win the ROTY but in reality fans of each player were more prone to comment on highlights of their preferred player than highlights of the other player.    &gt;idk man. it's not that complicated.  Except to you and a ton of users this apparently *is* complicated to think about.  Thinking in terms of huge numbers isn't intuitive and can be hard to grasp."
"You can stick with your anecdote, I can stick with the fact he got fouled 3.04% of the time he shot a 3. He drew three more 3pt shooting fouls than Donovan Mitchell, who shot almost 300 less threes over the course of the season. Trae Young also shot 300 less 3s, yet was fouled 3 MORE times than Dame."
"You can't afford not to sign a guy that averaged 4.3 ppg, 0.3 rpg and 0.3 spg over 3 whole games his senior year in high school. Just a can't miss prospect, Donovan Mitchell better watch out."
"Lillard is around that 9 range. Then you start getting into the Paul Georges and the like. maybe Donovan Mitchell, Beal, Booker, Trae, whoever you want. I wouldn't say 08-09 Melo is as good in overall value as Lillard is, so he's behind him for me. it'd be tough to say he ever as much in his career in the playoffs as Paul George. if you compare their careers in the playoffs, it's surprisingly not that close, so I wouldn't put him ahead there. I would say Melo is comfortably top 15, but he's for sure not top ten, to me."

"High: Was a fan of these players before they got drafted and often wondered why they werent picked a bit higher.   Dwyane Wade, Donovan Mitchell, John Collins, Deandre Jordan, Andre Iguodala, Danny Granger, Paul George, Joakim Noah, Roy Hibbert, Jrue Holiday, Kawhi Leonard, 	   Domantas Sabonis, Tyler Herro, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Tyrese Haliburton.   &amp;#x200B;  Wrong: I thought these players would be pretty good before the draft.

I‚Äôd say among current players he‚Äôs most similar to Donovan Mitchell except more athletic but with a worse jump shot
Jazz kind of seem like they fall into that category...but Donovan Mitchell could change that.
Donovan Mitchell is the 1/2 of the best guard line up you could think of‚Ä¶?
"To answer this question. Are you saying people in the comment section. You think any version of draymond green prime or now  with Donovan Mitchell is winning 50+ games with first seed in the west like they did last season.    Or Gobert the past 3 seasons with prime warriors isn't winning just as much.   Curry, klay, iggy, kd, gobert. Not winning more?"
Obviously no one was beating the Warrors but that Melo OKC team was actually pretty good and really clicking around Christmas and early January.  Andre Roberson was a DPOY candidate then he had a gruesome knee injury and the team defense just crumbled. Melo got exposed and Corey Brewer was starting for them..  Peak Andre Roberson would have probably made a difference vs Donovan Mitchell and Damien Lillard.
Ben Simmons will have a press conference to announce that he wasn‚Äôt a rookie while wearing one of those rookie definition hoodies Donovan Mitchell used to wear  https://www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/2018/4/10/17222466/donovan-mitchell-ben-simmons-rookie-of-the-year-award-race-beef-hoodie-jazz-76ers
Nuggets traded the Donovan Mitchell pick to Utah for Trey Lyles and a pick that became Tyler Lydon. Tyler. Lydon.
The last one that made go wow. Was the Jamal Murray- Donovan Mitchell game in the bubble.
Donovan Mitchell
Donovan Mitchell MVP
"Zach Collins.  Blazers traded up for him and he was pretty much a complete whiff.  Also painful considering who went after him (Donovan Mitchell, Bam, OG, John Collins, Jarrett Allen)."
"Sorry for some reason I thought nets were 12 ft tall. That makes sense they are 13 ft, otherwise we would see hands above the backboard frequently.d   A 36 inch standing vert especially with a 9‚Äô0 standing reach is special. Scottie Barnes max vert is 40 inches which isn‚Äôt as impressive as his standing vertical but it is still good and above average (especially for his size).   In the last 5 draft combines, there have been 6 players total with a standing vertical of more than 36 inches. Those players were Donovan Mitchell (6‚Äô1.25 H, 8‚Äô1 SR), Keon Johnson (6‚Äô3.5 height, 8‚Äô1 SR), Jericho Simms (6‚Äô9 H, 8‚Äô10 SR), Jalen Harris (6‚Äô2.75 H - 8‚Äô1.5 SR), Udoka Azubuike (6‚Äô10 H, 9‚Äô1 SR), Tyler Bey(6‚Äô6 H, 8‚Äô9.5 SR)  A 36 inch standing vertical would frequently put you at the top of your class for standing vertical and could even be the best (as it has been in multiple years). Considering that the only player in the last 5 years to measure a bigger standing reaching and standing vertical than Barnes was Udoka Azubuike who was just a rim running 5.   Even compare Barnes to rim runners like Jarrett Allen, Jaxon Hayes, Etc. He has better standing verticals than all of them, with close to the same standing reach and way more mobility."
...there is one blemish tho  The Donovan Mitchell trade.  You can say what u want but that trade was pretty terrible
"Booker, Lavine, and Donovan Mitchell.  Duncan, Kg, and Dirk  Tatum and Brown   Jimmy Butler and Paul George"
Donovan Mitchell
"I'm not saying Simmons is bad, he is a great player but he was overrated when he came to the league, he won rookie of the year just 3 years ago over Tatum and Donovan Mitchell. Who do you prefer in your team now?"
Donovan Booker or Devin Mitchell but it‚Äôs close
John Stockton Donovan Mitchell Joe Ingles Andrei Kirilenko Tim Duncan
Donovan Mitchell no bias whatsoever
"0. Steph Curry  1. Luka Doncic  2. Steve Nash  3. Klay Thompson  4. Ray Allen  Honorable Mentions: Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Zach Lavine, Kobe Bryant"
"As a Lavine stan, this feels high.   There‚Äôs so many talented dudes in the NBA. Like, how do you rank him against Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Jaylen Brown, etc? Cause those are guys all outside of the top 15 who play a similar position to Zach."
"I recommend you watch the nba lane commercial on the nba yt channel. You will get a good sense of all the players of impact the past 75 years since it's the nba 75th anniversary this season.   Then nba is going to have the ceremony on I think opening night this season to show you the greatest 75 players the past 75 years as well as the 10 coaches and 10 most important teams.   So your lucky makes your life easier lol. Now you know who's important by names, the coaches and teams. Now you go on yt and find out what they did.  Root for your favorite player that you feel influences your persona is the best way.   I like giannas, zach lavine, Ben simmons, Donovan Mitchell, and Michael Port Jr are my top 5 fav and kobe being my favorite of all time."
"Honestly Zach is extremely underrated. He's had better numbers than Donovan Mitchell and Booker, but just not elite players with him till now. Hence why were all excited to see the bulls more than the jazz or suns.   He's around the top 14- 17."
Devin Booker = Donovan Mitchell
Donovan Mitchell will have one of those weird chucker's nights when the ball just keeps going in and he'll drop 68
Jamaal Murray and Donovan Mitchell play 4 times during the regular season. So I'm picking one of them.
1.Kevin Durant  2.James Harden  3.Kahwi Leonard   4.LeOverrated  5.Jayson Tatum  6.Paul George  7.Jimmy Butler  8.Bradley Beal  9.Donovan Mitchell  10.Devin Booker
"That's because he isn't. Donovan Mitchell DEFINITELY isn't a wing. Me and Donovan Mitchell are the same exact height. I would definitely say he's an undersized guard in the NBA, but I mean.. he's a world class athlete so it helps lol. CBS Sports is out of their minds."
"04 - D Wade &amp; LeBron coughing making fun of Dirk during the Heat/Mavs finals because Dirk was coming down with the flu.  06 - Russ not letting Steven answer a question from a local OKC beat reporter and constantly saying 'next question.'  13 - D Wade hits ridiculous game winning shot in last season with Heat.  15 - Westbrook/Durant cupcake debacle.  17 - Donovan Mitchell made a really funny video during the bubble about Jaylen Brown.  20 - Ball goes out of play in D Wade's final game and Melo pretends to shoot it in from the sidelines. He wasn't on a team at this point. Him, LeBron &amp; Chris Paul were all side of court watching it.  21 - How do you, as a RAPS FAN, not know this one? We went to town on the Celtics and the camera panned to Kyrie thinking 'I'm getting the fuck out of here.'"
Nah and I‚Äôd put Donovan Mitchell over Booker too
"My reasoning is what it is, players in this era have performed better than players in previous eras in terms of box score due to defensive rules, pacing, and 3's. How many 25 ppg scorers were there in Melo's era, and compare that to Kawhi's era. Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell dropping 50 in playoffs, when some all time greats never hit 50 in Melo's era. I just think apples to apples comparisons without considering context of eras can't be done. Melo was also on bad teams (partly his fault), way worse than Kawhi has ever been on, so playoff time, people can fully focus Melo, which they can't for Kawhi. Again, I realize controversial, but that's what the thread said lol"
"Gobert wasn't switching onto anyone, he was helping at the rim. And I think a big part of how bad the defense was the immobility of Mike Conley and Donovan Mitchell due to leg/foot injuries"
"Imagine he comes out looking like rookie Donovan Mitchell, Fans and the media would love him then shred him to pieces when he fails in the postseason"
There‚Äôs also just not too much Mitchell can complain about tbh about the team around him. He‚Äôs got as much space to work with as possible with our shooters and Gobert‚Äôs screens. He‚Äôs got a top defense behind him. Frankly the things our team needs- a shutdown guard defender and a playmaker other than Conley- are roles he kinda needs to develop and fill. There‚Äôs just not a team out there that can give up the assets Mitchell would require and still have a better supporting cast for Donovan.   Maybe he really wants to be a number 2 scorer behind somebody like KD or Dame or Embiid but that doesn‚Äôt seem like something Mitchell would want.
"I mean if Ja were to take a jump this year, which is totally possible considering his age and progression, then yes CP3 and Donovan Mitchell seem very realistic. If anything Fox, Edwards, and even KPJ could all put up better numbers than those two this year"
"That means morant has to outplay 2 of steph, CP3, booker, Donovan Mitchell, dame, or luka for a guard spot from the west. Frankly, I just don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs going to be possible. Maybe CP drops off and Donovan Mitchell has a mediocre start to the season opening the gap? Seems unlikely to me Ja can make it this year"
‚ÄúToo small‚Äù but Donovan Mitchell is good because he‚Äôs so tall?
"I think an under the radar pick is Donovan Mitchell. There was all that racist stuff with the fans in UTA, they‚Äôve had two disappointing playoff exits in a row, and UTA isn‚Äôt the type of place to attract free agents. As a selfish note, if I were Daryl Morey I‚Äôd at least have called UTA‚Äôs GM saying, ‚ÄúListen, don‚Äôt hang up. I‚Äôll give you Ben, 3 firsts and 3 swaps for DMitch.‚Äù Does UTA hang up? Ben wouldn‚Äôt work with Gobert, but I think you could make it a 3-team blockbuster with POR, sending McCollum to UTA for Gobert. Every team gets better except for UTA, but I think Ben with all those shooters would still make them a 6th seed or so in the West. And they‚Äôd have all those picks.   Anyway, I really went down a rabbit hole there and it‚Äôll never happen but I do think Mitchell is a shadow candidate for this in the next year or two."
gobert is far more valuable to that team than mitchell. sure donovan is the no1 option and best scorer but gobert is the best player. mitch's value is more easily replaceable
"I don't even think it's an argument, I think it's clear. Here are the PGs who have carried a team through playoff runs and won them series: Curry, Harden or Kyrie (whichever is a PG), Luka, CP3, Lillard, Trae, Lowry, Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell, Jrue Holiday.  After that, there's a huge drop off in talent. This is the top 10."
"I only have data from the 2004-05 season onwards, but here are all the lineups with at least 100 games:  * ('Ben Wallace', 'Chauncey Billups', 'Rasheed Wallace', 'Richard Hamilton', 'Tayshaun Prince') 227 * ('Kendrick Perkins', 'Kevin Garnett', 'Paul Pierce', 'Rajon Rondo', 'Ray Allen') 221 * ('Kendrick Perkins', 'Kevin Durant', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Serge Ibaka', 'Thabo Sefolosha') 209 * ('Al Horford', 'Joe Johnson', 'Josh Smith', 'Marvin Williams', 'Mike Bibby') 180 * ('David West', 'George Hill', 'Lance Stephenson', 'Paul George', 'Roy Hibbert') 171 * ('Andrew Bynum', 'Derek Fisher', 'Kobe Bryant', 'Metta World Peace', 'Pau Gasol') 144 * ('Andrew Bogut', 'Draymond Green', 'Harrison Barnes', 'Klay Thompson', 'Stephen Curry') 136 * ('Jeff Green', 'Kevin Durant', 'Nenad Krstic', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Thabo Sefolosha') 133 * ('Bradley Beal', 'John Wall', 'Marcin Gortat', 'Markieff Morris', 'Otto Porter Jr.') 128 * ('Danny Green', 'Kawhi Leonard', 'Tiago Splitter', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tony Parker') 124 * ('Damian Lillard', 'LaMarcus Aldridge', 'Nicolas Batum', 'Robin Lopez', 'Wesley Matthews') 114 * ('Bruce Bowen', 'Manu Ginobili', 'Rasho Nesterovic', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tony Parker') 110 * ('Andre Roberson', 'Kevin Durant', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Serge Ibaka', 'Steven Adams') 109 * ('Jason Collins', 'Jason Kidd', 'Nenad Krstic', 'Richard Jefferson', 'Vince Carter') 106 * ('Derrick Favors', 'Donovan Mitchell', 'Joe Ingles', 'Ricky Rubio', 'Rudy Gobert') 106 * ('Andrei Kirilenko', 'Carlos Boozer', 'Deron Williams', 'Mehmet Okur', 'Ronnie Brewer') 101"
In the west I was also considering putting Luca or Donovan Mitchell. Wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing either of those as well
Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell. I just feel like their impact isn't as great as their stats would suggest. I feel like their teams would do better if they got others involved more. Booker with his role players and DMitch with Gobert specifically.
Surprised nobody has said Donovan Mitchell
"I‚Äôm sorry but like‚Ä¶.The fact that he has a team with russel Westbrook, Lebron James and Anthony Davis in the same tier as a team led by Rudy gobert and Donovan Mitchell says all you need to see"
Lmao at Donovan Mitchell being left out
"Donovan Mitchell, Ja Morant, LaMelo Ball, Damian Lillard, and Luka Doncic for me."
"Donovan Mitchell. I think it‚Äôs mostly a function of people always being ready to hate on Rudy but Donovan seems to escape criticism for things any other player would get crucified for (relative inefficiency, nonexistent defensive effort, not passing to his costar).   The fact that after 2019 most people were blaming Gobert and not Mitchell for losing to the rockets was just insane."
"Draymond is a great current up and comer, intelligent vet with an eye for the game and already involved in broadcasting. CP3 I think will want to stay involved in the league and has imparted knowledge to a lot of nba prospects. He may take more of that kobe mentor role and not broadcast however  Extrapolating out into the future there‚Äôs some young ones that will fun to see become vets who are very social and study the game a lot; Donovan Mitchell and Jaylen Brown are some amazing and bright personalities who study the game hard, are good public speakers I think would be cool to provide opinions and analysis when they‚Äôre older"
I guess but I think it‚Äôs kind of easy to parse the valid arguments and the nonsense. Some crazy take like ‚ÄúJoe ingles is better than Donovan mitchell because he has a higher EPM‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt get any traction.
[My nomination is Donovan Mitchell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOFlRjHeMX4)
"What I mean is his reputation didnt take as much as a hit as it probably would with other stars.  Like imagine if Donovan Mitchell was going 2-18 averaging like 6pts in the playoffs and got swept, we would never hear the end of it."
"In no particular order:    1. Lebron James   2. Steph Curry   3. Kevin Durant   4. James Harden   5. Kawhi Leonard   6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Anthony Davis   8. Nikola Jokic   9. Joel Embiid   10. Luka Doncic   11. Jayson Tatum   12. Bradley Beal   13. Jimmy Butler   14. Kyrie Irving   15. Bam Adebayo   16. Zion Williamson   17. Paul George   18. Chris Paul   19. Devin Booker   20. Damian Lillard   21. Donovan Mitchell   22. Zach Lavine   23. Trae Young   24. Nikola Vucevic   25. Jaylen Brown   26. Domantas Sobonis   27. Klay Thompson   28. Draymond Green   29. Khris Middelton   30. Russel Westbrook   These are the guys I can think of that I would say have an argument over Gobert right now.  As of right now I would probably put Gobert ahead of Green, Thompson (injury), Sobonis, Vucevic, Butler, Middelton and maybe Kyrie (though this may be personal bias and also Kyrie is such a wild card it is hard to evaluate him).  I think there is an argument Gobert is currently a better player than Brown, Young, Beal, Westbrook, Mitchell, Booker and Bam.   That puts him somewhere around the 25 - 15 best player range which is close enough to top 20.   [This](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/) has Gobert at 24th best player in the league.  So I don't think it is crazy to say that Gobert has a case for top 20."
Davion Mitchell will be better than Donovan Mitchell.
"Exactly. I get the we all love Jokic, I do too, but we‚Äôve got to admit he‚Äôs one of the worst rim protectors. I‚Äôm tired of ‚Äúhe‚Äôs good when he tries‚Äù stuff about nba stars. Like, Donovan Mitchell is fine when he tries, but he doesn‚Äôt often so he‚Äôs not a good defender"
Donovan Mitchell is 6‚Äô1 with a 6‚Äô11 wingspan it‚Äôs freaky but definitely possible
"No Joe ingles, Rudy Gobert, Hassan Whiteside, Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley, Bojan Bogdanovic, or Rudy Gay.  Let's go, Royce, lmao."
It depends on the seed we get and matchups honestly but zach lavine isn't better than Donovan Mitchell or kyrie irving
"&gt;and ended up being one of the best to ever play the game  Yes, that's only the eyes of fans who appreciate his physical appearance. In terms of actual on court results? **He can shoot the ball. But, that is all**. Nothing else. He's 6'3"" but cannot run the halfcourt set as good as most nba PGs today. He's not athletic, so he cannot dominate on the offensive end like other 6'3"" players/Russell Westbrook, Donovan Mitchell, etc. His defense is atrocious.  He was simply in the right place at the right time, when 2009 arrived. America was in a brand new place it'd never been in so the league-office got the urge to use the NBA for that symbolism of Pop Culture's love affair with Obama's election and therefore all humans with similar physical attributes as Obama.  Nonetheless, I love him as a person. Why? Because he sees the unfair, undeserved preferential treatment he receives for the past 6yrs ---*and he never EVER uses it to piss off other players like he can eeeeasily do*. Never.  He stays humble and unassuming, and it is truly a rarity. Most of all, whenever big media is being unfair to some melanin players \[Draymond, Wiseman, or Andrew Wiggins?\] then he always finds a way to just smile and make a public statement that subliminally/stealthily disagreed with how big media is handling said players."
Donovan Mitchell would like a word...
"lol I love when someone tries ice coverage, people go insane over how badly someone got crossed, when it's by intention to force the defender baseline. I remember when donovan mitchell ""crossed"" draymond like this and everyone was laughing, but you can literally hear ICE ICE ICE from someone on his team and he got tripped while icing the screen. kuzma did not get annihilated here because of a crossover, but because of miscommunication  still pretty stupid of kuzma to try to ice without the other defender hanging back, but it's bad for a completely different reason that people are roasting him for"
I will always be bitter that Donovan Mitchell got snubbed for ROY for this joker. I was right back then and I‚Äôm still right about it.
Luka for sure.   I'd also take Donovan Mitchell over Michael Jordan.
Donovan Mitchell do be kinda shifty...
"Top 15?  Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Joel Embiid, Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jimmy Butler, Jokic, KAT, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Chris Paul  These are all players I would rather have. Honorable mentions (aka: players I would still rather have, but aren't as good as the above) - Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown, Draymond Green, Pascal Siakam, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Zach Lavine, Bam Adebayo, Zion Williamson, Donovan Mitchell."
Gotta be weird sayin this when Simmons has spent his whole career making Donovan Mitchell look like a scrub
Simmons also for ROTY a few years ago against Donovan Mitchell.
"I got you. I‚Äôll go by the positions they are playing this year.   PG: Stephen Curry, James Harden, Luka Doncic, Damian Lillard, CP3  SG: Paul George, Bradley Beal, Zach Lavine, Kyrie Irving, Donovan Mitchell   SF: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Jaylen Brown  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, Julius Randle   C: Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, KAT   Top 10 in order:  1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. Stephen Curry  5. James Harden  6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Nikola Jokic   8. Luka Doncic   9. Anthony Davis   10. Damian Lillard"
Is that Donovan Mitchell you have over Luka? That's ridiculous and I love Donovan Mitchell. I dont think I'd put Kyrie or PG over Luka either but I think they are all close enough for an argument. Also you don't have to make the conference finals to he a top 10 guy in the league. Team success can only be a small part of the equation considering the player has no control of his roster and as you said you need multiple stars to advance.
"donovan mitchell was listed at first even 6'4, then 6'3 now 6'1. But then he'll look as tall as every 6'3 player he's next to him. He's not as tall as Rondo honestly."
Trae Young and Donovan Mitchell being listed as the same height doesn't feel right.
Thought Donovan Mitchell was at least 6‚Äô5 untill I checked his height. Maybe because he‚Äôs bulky
Donovan Mitchell is apparently 6‚Äô1 thought he was at least 6‚Äô3 if not 6‚Äô5
"My irl 12 year old nephew told me that Donovan Mitchel should be MVP and I just softly agreed with him. Thought about going full send into the argument, but didn‚Äôt want to crush his enthusiasm. So now when I‚Äôm around him Donovan Mitchell is my MVP."
"Top 20ish Donovan Mitchell elevates his game in the playoffs and the Jazz already have a top 15 guy in Gobert. They also have arguably the deepest bench in the league, including two guys in Joe Ingles and Jordan Clarkson who could be starting for other playoff teams and they will have homecourt advantage throughout the playoffs so they've got as good a chance to won it all this year as anyone else and anyone who says they're not contenders is a clown. They do have one very clear achilles heel though and there's a chance it gets exposed and their success will be matchup dependent just like every other team."
Enter Donovan Mitchell... https://youtu.be/y9EdOgQcbsY
Frank doesn't feel as bad anymore  because realistically it was him or Dennis Smith Jr and we dropped Dennis Smith Jr now. Of course Donovan Mitchell was on the board but we couldn't have the Knicks being that good.
"I disagree.   I think Donovan is better than most people think he is, yet Gobert is still clearly the best player on the Jazz.  It's a bizarre catch-22.  Gobert is so criminally underrated that Mitchell gets underrated cuz Jazz fans &amp; real basketball minds all say Gobert is Utah's best player."
LeBron  Curry  KD  Harden  Kawhi  Giannis  Embiid  Jokic  Dame  Luka  Paul George  Kyrie  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Trae Young   Julias Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Ben Simmons  Zack LaVine  Nikola Vucevic  Bradley Beal  Rudy Gobert  Donovan Mitchell  Anthony Davis  CJ McCollum  Demar Derozan  Zion Williamson  Brandon Ingram  DeAaron Fox  SGA  KAT  He‚Äôs better then 15 of these guys? No. Cmon bro.
"LeBron  Curry  KD  Harden  Kawhi  Giannis  Embiid  Jokic  Dame  Luka  Paul George  Kyrie  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Trae Young   Julias Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Ben Simmons  Zack LaVine  Nikola Vucevic  Bradley Beal  Rudy Gobert  Donovan Mitchell  Anthony Davis  CJ McCollum  Demar Derozan  Zion Williamson  Brandon Ingram  DeAaron Fox  SGA  KAT  Sabonis  Which five guys is he better than?  I think he has an argument, but it isn‚Äôt easily."
Donovan Mitchell is going to be such an awesome Pacer!
"PG: Start Fred VV Bench Brogdan Cut Sexton (Fred is best player- need D on second unit more than O so Brogdan over Sexton)  SG: Start Devin Booker Bench Donovan Mitchell Cut Lavine (Booker spaces the floor with 1st unit, Mitchell can lock down on D when focused but him vs Lavine is really a toss up)  SF: Start Tatum Bench Butler Cut George ( Tatum can shoot and play D- Love Butlers grit on a star studded team, I just don't really like or trust PG in a big game)  PF: Start Zion Bench Randle Cut Grant (Zion goes without saying Randle is a beast off the bench and Grant isn't needed)  C: Start Jokic Bench Embiid, Cut Davis (Jokic will absolutely dice em up on O even if him and Zion might struggle a bit defensively. Also Jokic is my favorite sorry not sorry. Embiid can be the orbit of the second unit. AD is great but we don't need him here.)    &amp;#x200B;  All in all our offense will be insane even if we couldn't made a better defensive starting unit.   &amp;#x200B;  Fun question!"
"**PG:** fuck Fred VanVleet, marry Malcolm Brogdon, kill Collin Sexton   **SG:** fuck Devin Booker, marry Donovan Mitchell, kill Zach Lavine   **SF:** fuck Jimmy Butler, marry Jayston Tatum, kill Paul George   **PF:** fuck Jerami Grant, marry Zion Williamson, kill Julius Randle   **C:** fuck Nikola Jokic, marry Joel Embiid, kill Anthony Davis    I really didn't want to kill Julius Randle but I guess them's the breaks. Fun exercise OP, thanks for posting."
"Interestingly, one **could** build the lineup that the Denver nuggets FO was attempting to build this offseason:  Murray  Jrue  MPJ  Jerami  Jokic  Ofc we know grant didn‚Äôt stay as we expected and we got way outbid for jrue. But that lineup on paper is quite good across the board.  Bonus points if you select OG for bench/flex, since we disastrously tried to trade down to select him at 24 (the Donovan Mitchell trade) only to have Masai snipe OG from us at 23. Arguably, we should have just taken him at 12.  That said, even if I were trying to build the above roster, draymond is a way better fit than Jerami is. He just obviously wasn‚Äôt available for our FO when they were crafting their lineup lol. AD would also fit like a glove at the 4 next to Jokic.  So theoretically, one could build a ‚Äúsuper nuggets‚Äù roster (simply because you chose so many nuggets and as a nuggets fan that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm drawn to first) of:  Jamal/FVV  Jrue/SGA  MPJ/OG  Dray/Grant  Jokic/AD  And you‚Äôd have a ton of flexibility. Probably would end up starting AD at the 4. Not sure if you lose too much offensive punch if you also slide dray up to the 3 over MPJ, but it feels wrong bringing draymond off the bench lol.  I feel pretty confident that this roster would do pretty well against any other combination of players from this list, if for no other reason than a lot of them already have a lot of chemistry together and the ones who don‚Äôt fit together incredibly well on paper and have high enough BBIQs that I don‚Äôt think it should be an issue."
"homer take, but i think Mitchell should be in the convo #1 option on the best team in the league usually does it.  That being said its no secret that Gobert is more impactul than Donovan, but i dont think a player like Gobert can ever realistically win mvp cuz hes not flashy.  I have Jokic as the MVP, Curry and Lebron behind them, then u have guys like Lillard, Spida, Gobert, PG13 maybe? im sure im missing some names."
This was Donovan Mitchell every game for his first 2 years.
"Are any of those guys top 30 though?   Semi ordered ranking:   1. LeBron James  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo  3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Nikola Jokic  5. Anthony Davis 6. James Harden  7. Steph Curry  8. Kevin Durant  9. Luka Doncic 10. Joel Embiid 11. Damian Lillard  12. Jimmy Butler 13. Jayson Tatum 14. Chris Paul  15. Paul George  16. Bradley Beal 17. Karl-Anthony Towns 18. Devin Booker  19. Bam Adebayo 20. Donovan Mitchell  21. Kyrie Irving 22. Ben Simmons 23. Rudy Gobert  24.  Jamal Murray  25. Zion Williamson  26. Trae Young  27. Zach LaVine 28. Russell Westbrook  29. Khris Middleton   30. Jaylen Brown   Then you've got guys like Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porzi≈Üƒ£is, Nikola Vucevic, Malcolm Brogdon, Domas Sabonis, Gordon Hayward, CJ McCollum, Kyle Lowry, Brandon Ingram, DeMar DeRozan, Mike Conley, Christian Wood that you could argue for the next 10 spots or maybe as high as 25-30th?"
I‚Äôm sorry if true shooting is too confusing for you. Would you say Donovan Mitchell ‚Äúcan‚Äôt be stopped‚Äù this year? He‚Äôs scoring more on better efficiency than Rose did in his MVP season. We should give him the MVP right now.
"Would you take Brandon Ingram over any of the following: Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell, Jaylen Brown, Pascal Siakam, or De'Aaron Fox? Didn't even bother including Ben Simmons or Jayson Tatum because BI isn't in the same convo add those two.  I feel like Ingram doesn't have that 2nd skill that you point to when his shot isn't falling. All of the other guys are able to impact the game outside of just scoring. I feel like the hair trigger answer might be Siakam, but I feel like even his scoring ability has more layers than just contested jumpers.  I just wonder if the Pels are risking mediocrity by trying to make Zion and Ingram work just because they maxed him already."
"I keep hearing people ask why Booker or CP3, or Donovan Mitchell or Rudy Gobert, are not ""at least in the conversation.""   If someone want to make a case for one of those guys being the MVP, go right ahead. I'd like to hear it. Otherwise, they're not in the conversation. We don't pick MVP honorable mentions. If someone can't get a first place vote, they're not really in it."
"I bet he was so mad when D Wade became a part owner he burned his Joe Ingles jersey, because we know he doesn‚Äôt have a Donovan Mitchell jersey for ‚Äúreasons‚Äù."
Donovan Mitchell saying god is good all the time‚Ä¶ so why did god let Floyd die in the first place?
"I think CP3 has the best case of the three. Lavine is likely out because he'll miss two weeks and the Bulls aren't in the playoff picture. Kyrie is borderline because he's missed 16 games and will likely miss more, but his numbers/team performance are good enough that he'll probably get in. One of Kyrie/CP3 probably misses in favor of Donovan Mitchell."
Donovan Mitchell got 57 less than a year ago
"It's not a knock on him I just think some guys below him are close talent wise and have proven more. Donovan and Devin average more points on winning teams and while they are in much better situations can we continue to look past the fact that KAT hasn't really as accomplished anything yet. More and more stars continue to catch up with those numbers and at this point I'd put a lot of guys ahead of him till I can see how far KAT can lead a solid roster around him. I know it's unfair that he hasn't gotten a good roster around him yet but the gap has gotten small enough between the guys behind him talent wise that I don't think it's a given to put KAT ahead of guys like Booker, Mitchell, Trae, and others as well."

Donovan Mitchell looks like he‚Äôs loving life every time he dunks.
donovan mitchell then lol ?
Jazz were without their third option Donovan Mitchell in this game
"Eliminating the Nuggets from playoff contention, giving them a lottery pick they might have missed otherwise, as they won their last two games. I believe Portland held the tiebreaker over Denver, but Portland also could have easily lost to San Antonio the next night - as it stands they only won by 1 point.  In 2017 draft, the Nuggets got Donovan Mitchell with their lottery pick. Various advanced stats place Mitchell as the 2nd to 4th best player from that draft so far. Portland, meanwhile, won just as many playoff games as Denver that year, but ended up with Justin Jackson, who has had a rather lackluster career thus far.  The only players of roughly similar value to Mitchell picked after him are Bam Adebayo (who was picked by the late-lottery Heat and thus unavailable to any playoff team), John Collins, and Jarrett Allen.  Westbrook's 35 foot dagger was a building block in the future of the Nuggets."
Nikola Jokic  Steph Curry  Joel Embiid  Giannis Antetokounmpo  James Harden  LeBron James  Luka Doncic  Damian Lillard  Donovan Mitchell  Kawhi Leonard
"It's a terrible name for them. ""Spider"" works for someone like Anderson Silva, who is spindly and who stalks you and seems to hit you from nowhere. Doesn't work at all for guys like Donovan Mitchell or Morant. What's spider-like about them?"
"Bruh Donovan Mitchell is already called ""Spida""..."
i was able to trade donovan mitchell for steph in fantasy lol
"They didn‚Äôt even make it past the 2nd round, why the hell would we call them a superteam? Lol it‚Äôs like how people will call guys like Tatum or Donovan Mitchell superstars when it should be reserved for the best of the best. It‚Äôs just people using hyperbole but acting like it‚Äôs not to try to make their point mean more"
"League young.  Assume Ben Simmons and Donovan Mitchell are equal talent-- they're the same age but Mitchell is making 9m this year to Simmons 30. Doesn't really make sense to include both of them in the same tier when talking about a ""core""."
As a jazz fan I hate on him for the ROTY thriving of Donovan Mitchell and the DPOY arguments against Gobert.  He eared his ROTY but got an additional year with pro level staff to be ready. With his defense he zero statistical evidence he is an all-team player.   He‚Äôs got a great ceilings but he has made me specifically route against the 76ers
Donovan Mitchell isn‚Äôt Top 10 for MVP anywhere but Utah lmfao
"The person you responded to certainly didn't make a good or clear argument, but each situation is completely different.   &gt;Mitchell  Donovan Mitchell was drafted 13th overall, and was then traded to a Jazz team that won 51 games the previous year. That's as dissimilar from Trae's position as possible. He walked into a steady franchise that was already winning a ton of games.  &gt;Tatum  The Celtics won 53 games the year before Tatum arrived, and played in the Conference Finals. Trae's Hawks won 24 games the year before he arrived, and I'd bet huge sums of money that there isn't a single non-Hawks fan on this entire board that could name their most common starting 5. Hell, the Warriors are a complete mess this year even with Curry and Draymond, and that Hawks team had 2 starters that are now backups on the Warriors.  &gt;Luka  Luka has yet to finish as a top 4 seed, and likely won't this year as well."
"In person: Derrick Rose and LeBron trading back-to-back game winners in 2015, performance-wise they were kind of whatever but obviously that just really sticks out to me         On TV live: I don't know there's quite a few, Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell going back and forth in the bubble was crazy, Kevin Durant game 3 in 2018, Klay Thompson game 6 in 2016, LeBron's performance in the Cavaliers come back in 2016 and so on, it's tough to just pick one of those live, but if I absolutely positively had to pick a game that I saw live I guess I will go with LeBron's game 6 against the Celtics in 2012, I think it's still the greatest game he's ever played, he just looked.... different that night, like the motherfuker was possessed or something lol"
[Rookie Donovan Mitchell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfqPFgDOjSo) was fun as fuck  He has since calmed down with the dunks though unfortunately
"Start: De‚ÄôAaron Fox, Donovan Mitchell, Paul George, Zion Williamson, Rudy Gobert  Bench: Trae Young, Bradley Beal, Jayson Tatum, Julius Randle, Bam Adebayo  Cut: The rest of em  Shooting guard is definitely the most difficult to decide. Close race between all of them."
Donovan Mitchell scoring the most playoff points in a game (57) since MJ was pretty legendary.
"Donovan Mitchell and Dame are major playoff performers though. Donovan just put up like 40ppg against the Nuggets last year. Dude is a killer.   And Russ only really played bad in the Portland series (and the OKC/Lakers series, but he was injured). He was good in the Houston series, had a like a +40 +/- for the last 4 games of the series while his bench was all negative. He played shitty for the first few games of the Jazz series, but then put the team on his back and would've forced a game 7 if not for PG putting up 5 points on 16 shots.    You can't just write him off for his TS% when he does so much more than score."
"Not me, but my brother hates Donovan Mitchell... like SO much lol. Apparently he just ""plays like a bitch"""
"Here's a few more.   Isaiah Stewart is better than James Wiseman.   While Tyrese Haliburton is better currently, Killian Hayes will be better in his prime.   Duncan Robinson's season last year was a fluke. He's still an elite shooter, but hes never going to shoot 46% on 8 threes per game ever again. Probably more like 39-40% (which is still good).   Saddiq Bey is better than Blake Griffin.   If Kawhi Leonard wasn't an MVP candidate playing 78% of the games last season, Embiid shouldn't be an MVP candidate playing 68% of his games.   Donovan Mitchell is the Jazz's best player. It becomes obvious in the playoffs imo.  Curry is more valuable to the Warriors than Harden is to the Nets.   Not all players who put up good numbers on a bad team are empty stats players."
Donovan Mitchell and especially Dame are really good players too.
Not since KD left. He‚Äôs been outplayed by guys like Donovan Mitchell and Dame routinely
"hyperbole obv but yeah i was thinking about this earlier, his size really makes him different from other guys this sub and the bball internet criticizes for ""inefficient volume scoring"". Like in the playoffs and end of game, him being so much bigger really allows him to get his shot off and better shots than someone like Donovan Mitchell or even Ja (both who this sub recently hate lol)"
 Nah there have be been better games...  Nets/Clippers (Harden‚Äôs epic flop!) Lakers/Sixers (Tobias‚Äô buzzer beater) Clippers/Jazz (Donovan Mitchell went crazy and almost won the game by himself)  are some that come to mind.
"I'd put him ahead of PG right now, and if he keeps up this hot streak he could pass Butler by the end of the playoffs. solidly in the 12th-15th range by the end of the year. The only real caveat to that is who else is looking dangerous for those spots, guys like Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell and Zion Williamson are all one big year away from also being in the top 5/10/15 etc. conversations. JT is probably the best of that group of guys competing and with Murray/Mitchell injured it likely helps build his case.   good point tho I am a bostonian and huge C's fan and hearing people say Tatum is already a top 10 player is just too soon. maybe once the current old guard (LBJ, Dame, Kawhi) start to go on the downswing he can shoot up"
I think this is targeted at donovan mitchell lol. Or maybe tatum
Honestly if you swap donovan Mitchell and trae young... the jazz are a dynasty. Gobert's screening ability with the test of the perfectly structured team composition and a great coach? That's the model I want the hawks to follow.
Mild take - trae young gets a disproportionate amount of hate  Hot take - trae young is better than donovan Mitchell and if you swapped them two the jazz are a title dynasty.
"Tbf, they don‚Äôt got their battery and heart Donovan Mitchell playing"
I would add Donovan Mitchell based on where Utah almost always drafts and difficulty they particularly have in securing free agents?

"Thank the ball gods. I don‚Äôt like the Jazz much, but I fucking love Donovan Mitchell. Great news that he‚Äôs gonna be ok"
Well Donovan Mitchell has one great upset under his belt and another great series. Dame has several upsets. Davis a championship and Murray beat the clippers and jazz. Giannis has beat one good team his entire playoff career the Celtics and hasn‚Äôt had a close series since
"Sure, he got outplayed in a series against a rookie Donovan Mitchell, with Westbrook shooting like 39% and having some all time bad games like this one: https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201804210UTA.html  Mind the 8 TOs.   Or the Blazers series with this game 2: https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201904160POR.html  And this game 4: https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201904210OKC.html  Some of these are like the definition of shooting your team out of games. Or are turnover city. And I understand that lots of players have bad playoff games but Westbrook‚Äôs are about as rough as it gets for an MVP. And I‚Äôm not a Westbrook hater, I know in this sub once you criticize a player people like you get downvoted, but I stand by my statement."
"I think you confused Donovan Mitchell with the Nugget's PG, Jamal Murray."
"""Donovan Mitchell is down and he appears to be seriously hurt""  &amp;#x200B;  Thumbnail: Big smile!"
"Donovan Mitchell, is that the guy who had 2 50 point games in 1 playoff series or the guy who had 2 50 point games in 1 playoff series"
Wait 76ers fans hate Donovan Mitchell? As a 76ers fan this is news to me.
"The Jazz are going to ""fall"" because they're going to want to avoid injury. Now that we have the news with Donovan Mitchell I think that gets more into moot point territory because it happened already, but my entire point was centered around them wanting to avoid the exact sort of situation that happened to Donovan. Instead, the very next day after my prediction their best player goes down for an unknown amount of time... to injury.  But, again, like I pointed out in my post, I don't believe in the Jazz ""falling"" so much as I do in the Suns and Clippers succeeding. I just think the Clippers and Suns are playing better basketball right now and will both pass them. Obviously, the likelihood of my prediction has gone up considerably with Donovan out. But it isn't because the Jazz are worse, I just expect their organization to gear up for competing in the playoffs rather than worrying about getting the 1 seed. That includes getting some losses to teams they'd normally beat."
Im about to go full Donovan Mitchell on this call
[X-Rays are negative!](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31271369/utah-jazz-star-donovan-mitchell-exits-game-ankle-injury-x-rays-negative-sources-say)
The NBA is a league built on star power so yes why would anyone care that some nobody role player gets hurt compared to Donovan Mitchell or Jamal Murray
"Seriously, not only is this horrible for Donovan Mitchell and the Jazz, it feels like we're not even going to see the western conference playoff bloodbath that was promised"
Resting players this season makes a ton of sense. Players are dropping like flies left and right now. Just in this week alone we have lost Jamal Murray and now Donovan Mitchell is down.

This is so damn eazy and the answer is Donovan Mitchell. He is beloved by most but a couple fan bases can't stand his success because of petty grudges.
Donovan Mitchell is disliked by 76ers fans and some suns fans but is generally liked by all other fan bases.

I think you‚Äôre thinking of Donovan Mitchell. Simmons was the clear leader all year
Donovan Mitchell already won the dunk contest in 2018 thanks to another equally bad judge.
He's going to be the Donovan Mitchell whisperer.
Donovan Mitchell future laker ‚Äî let the tears flow I wanna taste it
"He sees himself in donovan mitchell, he knows its a good time to invest."
"Dwayne Wade and Jazz owner Ryan Smith are good friends according to ESPN.  Also, Dwayne Wade has been kind of a mentor to Donovan Mitchell and I believe they are pretty good friends as well."
The team has done quite a bit to make sure they pushed against it. See the Millers banning the fan during the Westbrook debacle and creating an anti racist initiative in general for the team. Then comes in Ryan Smith who is not only giving away scholarships but making sure it‚Äôs solely eligible to minority youth to help promote them up. As well Cox the Utah governor literally said yesterday that people who were upset about this shouldn‚Äôt be in any way as it‚Äôs a good promotion and the jazz have a right to help who they deem fit.   Not to mention Donovan Mitchell being the face of the franchise who is a known promoter of bringing forward black issues and is probably the most beloved player on the jazz currently and on his way to becoming the most loved in franchise history.   People are pushing narratives when I think a majority of fans and major figure heads of the jazz and Utah in general have done a lot especially over the past few years to say we‚Äôre anything but racists.
In b4 Wade is a judge in next year's dunk contest and Donovan Mitchell *mysteriously* wins it.
ESPN Headline ‚ÄúIS DONOVAN MITCHELL HURTING UTAHS CHANCES AT A CHAMPIONSHIP???‚Äù
"I read that of the 15 times a player has averaged at least 26pts and 5ast on the team with the best record, the player has gone to win the MVP 13 times. That's Donovan Mitchell, yet some people are still putting him on the 3rd team if not completely off all the All-NBA teams which is crazy to me."
[Donovan Mitchell having flashbacks ](https://youtu.be/PqRj1wniRQQ)
I don‚Äôt know any competent coaches that subscribe to analytics. Rockets lost because they have players who are average shooters shooting 10 threes a game. That‚Äôs bad basketball. Emoni bates or Luka can get any coach in the nba except pop fired they are generational talents coaching does not matter in basketball Rudy tomjonavich won twice. Do you think any player sees Donovan Mitchell coming down court and says ok don‚Äôt worry he only shoots 45%. Jokic is a statistical darling and Mitchell outplayed him when they matched up Murray saved jokic in that series inefficient Mitchell was the best player on the court.
I‚Äôm a fan I have my opinions but at the end of the day as someone who played the game I‚Äôd never question what a top 300 player in the world does. You new fans actually think you know more about basketball than someone like Donovan Mitchell because he shoots 44%.
"Unfortunately, people will just never consider Gobert for MVP. RAPTOR and LEBRON have him ranked number one, and he also has amazing on/off numbers. He has a team with limited defensive talent consistently in the top 5 in the whole league, and has an offense built around his pick and roll at the number 3 spot in the league. It's not like he's being propped up by an elite playmaker or amazing perimeter defense, he was able to take a team with a rookie Donovan Mitchell as the next best player to a 5th seed in the west. He is the reason the Jazz have been competitive and no one else in the league can fill his role the way he does. I'm not saying he should win, but it's dumb he can't even be brought up in the conversation without being laughed at."
"Yeah another thing I noticed was that he said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to miss you,‚Äù and then went a step further and said, ‚Äú*I* am going to miss you.‚Äù So genuine and heartfelt.  There are a handful of other NBA players I think are like this to an extent but probably none quite like Giannis. Steph Curry, Dwayne Wade, Kyle Korver, Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley, Norm Powell"
"Two of those picks were traded up for #10, which could have been Bam Adebayo or Donovan Mitchell.  It isn‚Äôt an insane offer but almost anyone would have agreed it was better than Vic and Sabonis at the time"
"Michael Jordan, he was gambling like crazy, he was great on ball, but he definitely had a lot of bad moments off the ball  Currently :  \- Mason Plumlee : Malone always used him as a defensive sub, despite the fact that he's not even a better defender than Jokic, he plays hard, but he makes a lot of mistakes, fouls a ton, he's average at the absolute best  \- Kelly Oubre and Gary Trent Jr : those 2 together because they are the same, they play ultra hard, they put on a show, tap on the floor, get on a ultra low stance....but I've actually rarely seen them stay in front of anyone decent, and both aren't strong enough for the real big wings  \- Domantas Sabonis and Brandon Ingram most people think they are average/slightly below average, in reality they are terrible  \- PatBev : he's still useful because he's strong for his size and can switch but he fouls a toooon and a lost a lot of lateral quickness  \- Khris Middleton : he's still a decent option on big wings because of his size but since his injury a few years ago he' snot been the same athlete at all, he can't stay in front, he execute the scheme well, and can send his guy to Lopez/Giannis at the rim, but he can't stay in front of guys  \- Lou Dort : he might be THE best iso defender in the league, but he's not that good at getting trough screens, guarding off ball movement, he's a great defender, but he's gotten a bit overrated  \- Robert Covington : great help defender, a really mediocre on ball guy  \- Donovan Mitchell : the new Russ, still has a defensive reputation because he was good in college, he's at best average, probably worse than that.  \- And to finish the one that will get me downvoted, he's an awesome defender, but Ben Simmons isn't the DPOY"
"We lost our second and third best players to injury for half/most the season. We not only lost our starting SG and C but also our backup C/PF (gone for the whole season, maybe his career is over). Keeping in mind that the replacements we found for these guys are deeply flawed cast off pick ups. Damian Lillard carried us to the 4th seed (I think it was 4) before HE went down to injury for a stretch that saw us drop to 7th seed.  I'll admit I'm not aware of any of the teams ahead of us having nearly that level of sustained injury problem.  Nuggets lost Jamal for the rest of the season recently, but they also picked up Aaron Gordon.  Suns...who has been injured on the Suns?  Jazz...Injuries? Donovan Mitchell recently turned his ankle right? Out for a week? Have they had any major injuries?  Clips, I know you guys have enough talent to actually rest your players on back to backs and such. What kind of injuries have you had?  Not sure about the Mavs. Porzingas is probably hurt though.  Lakers, Obviously just recently Lebron and earlier this season AD for a while. So, while they have had injuries...again they also have actual talented basketball players to fill those gaps. Whereas we do shit like play our 10 day contract Rondae Hollis-Jefferson for significant minutes."
"Currently, 6th man of the year favorite (-1250 today on Draft Kings)  is other Utah Jazz stud, Jordan Clarkson.  Clarkson is a huge part of the reason that the Jazz have held the league's top record for virtually the entire season, as he provides them with a major scoring spark off of the bench. With a career-high average of 17.5 points per performance, Clarkson is Utah's second-leading scorer, despite the fact that he only plays 26 minutes per game. Only Donovan Mitchell (26.4 points per game) scores more than Clarkson for Utah.   That said. The NEXT odds favorite (+500) is Joe Ingles"
"I got something similar to that, a Donovan Mitchell fan page getting jingled http://imgur.com/gallery/nKEHYzC"

"The game before the shut down we played the Pistons, and he went against Christian Wood. [Wood reportedly played with flu symptoms](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/03/16/report-since-diagnosed-with-coronavirus-christian-wood-played-76ers-with-flu-like-symptoms/) the very same day Gobert tested positive. It's possible he got it from Wood. It's also possible Gobert got it from Donovan Mitchell, as a week before the shutdown the Jazz played the Knicks and Donovan who is from Westchester County NY and spent time with friends and family. Westchester County was one of the first COVID hotspots.  I'm not trying to play ""find patient zero"" but just feel bad for how much hate Rudy got for being the first one tested. I get he brought some of the hate on himself, but dude will forever be known as the guy who gave the NBA Covid."

donovan mitchell aint a pg btw lol
Bro not even top 10. Thats what makes it worse  LeBron  Trae  Luka  Harden/Kyrie (whichever you wanna consider a PG)  Lillard  Curry  CP3  Ben Simmons  Donovan Mitchell  Kemba  Westbrook
the jazz arent playing donovan mitchell or mike conley jr until the playoffs  we're gobert and bojan men now

"He‚Äôs shooting better overall than Mr. Donovan Mitchell this year and his shooting is known as his worst attribute so, he‚Äôs still something special to me"
"Yeah. Most of the heavy hitters drafted in the past 10 years have all ended up in the West. AD, Luka, Zion, Dame, Towns (even though his team sucks), Booker, Donovan Mitchell, SGA, Gobert, Fox, Ingram, Morant, Jokic.  Meanwhile, the East drafted Giannis, Embiid, Trae Young, Beal, Tatum, Simmons, Jaylen Brown, Bam."
"I mean he does. He single handily led his team to the Finals. Something WB hasn‚Äôt been been close to doing, he can‚Äôt even get out of the first round and gets outplayed by guys like Dame and Donovan Mitchell.   AI went up against a prime Vince Carter and Ray Allen and balled tf out."
"Good lord this guy is the most overrated player since Carmelo Anthony. I‚Äôve never seen a dude averaging 5 turnovers a game on 50% TS get this much praise on a 10 seed in this pathetic East. Outplayed by rookie Donovan Mitchell, outplayed by Dame, then shits the bed against the Lakers and nearly lost the series for the Rockets against OKC. Only one season after being traded away for one of the greatest PGs of all time + 2 FRP+ 2 pick swaps, he gets traded for a washed Wall with a horrible contract and 1 2023 lottery protected pick. When it‚Äôs all said and done he won‚Äôt even be top 10"
"The problem is the league has had an influx of talent the past few years, and people can't separate that just because a ton of star caliber players enter the league in a short period doesn't mean Westbrook is a washed up bum because some of these young guys surpass him, while some of the other top players from his MVP season like Curry, LeBron, Davis, Durant, Kyrie, Butler, Dame, etc. haven't really fallen off.   Just since Westbrook's MVP season, we've added Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, Luka Doncic, Trae Young, SGA, Zion, and Ja Morant through the draft. Combine that with other rookie contract guys from his MVP season like Ben Simmons, Brandon Ingram, Jaylen Brown, Jamal Murray, Domantis Sabonis, Pascal Siakam, Towns, Embiid, Lavine, Capela, Oladipo, Jokic, Giannis, and Gobert all developing into star level players."
Donovan Mitchell = Spiderman?
He‚Äôs top 30 right now man. I‚Äôm taking him over Donovan Mitchell or Siakam tbh
Plenty of players have made it out of the first round without Kevin Durant.  Donovan Mitchell as a rookie did it.  Against Westbrook‚Äôs team that had superior talent
"&gt;  like if the play-ins were actually unfair then we should be seeing people like Embiid, Doc Rivers, or Donovan Mitchell, KD, etc. speak out against it  Guaranteed if the Lakers drop to 7th and then lose game 1 but win game 2 you'll hear a SHIT ton of complaints about how it's unfair whoever is the 1 seed has to face the Lakers round 1"
"no shit. like if the play-ins were actually unfair then we should be seeing people like Embiid, Doc Rivers, or Donovan Mitchell, KD, etc. speak out against it     People who aren't close to being in the play-in"
So up until last week Donovan Mitchell should've been 2nd on your list then?
"You're right. Suns most likely taking the 1 seed. 2nd seed is more likely for Denver because Utah is also missing Donovan Mitchell for at least a week more.  Jamal's injury was horrible for them yet they've won 9 out of the last 10 games. Not that they wouldn't win with Jamal in the line-up. Both Utah and Denver are deep teams with great role players, but unlike the Jazz, the Nuggets still have their MVP."
There are definitely some people who are like ‚ÄúDenver drafted Donovan Mitchell‚Äù and traded them or even more common ‚ÄúAtlanta drafted Doncic‚Äù
"&gt; It's gonna take a bonafide rookie star that has full reign of the offense  Donovan Mitchell being on the list is pretty telling. I think it's something we'll see broken in the next 10 years.  Probably not an ""every year"" thing like people are saying though."
Same record as the Jazz now. Should be a fun race to 1 but Donovan Mitchell will be out a while still. Suns have avoided injuries to star players.
Rudy Gobert + Donovan Mitchell  (thanks again Denver)
Damn you‚Äôre mad you got Donovan Mitchell and Rudy gobert on max deals...I get it
Lol your best player is Donovan Mitchell and you‚Äôre going to call another team frauds
"uhm you are viewing this from the wrong perspective, only 47% of his potential assists actually lead to assists which is a pretty low number so his teammates just dont convert his passes  and why are you talking about passes received? he has 48 passes per game which is more then Jamal Murray, Ja Morant, Donovan Mitchell, Jrue Holiday ..."
"People will, but it's because the Jazz win a ton of games and he's easily their best player in adjusted plus/minus data.  I think people also have trouble processing that not all wins are equal. This data is based on 60 something games across the entire range of NBA teams. Is Gobert going to be more useful than Donovan Mitchell for beating say the Clippers? I'm not sure about that. But for beating the Clippers + Pistons + Nuggets + Hornets, etc.? Yes."
"Donovan Mitchell, Murray, Tatum, lots of guys."
Donovan Mitchell/Jimmy Butler/and Jeff Teague would make a stacked college team
Donovan Mitchell is not the best player on the Jazz.
What if Jazz have Luka instead of Donovan Mitchell?
"Russ's USG% this year is actually his lowest mark since 2009-2010, and he's got a lower usage rate than other guards like:  -Luka Doncic  -Bradley Beal  -Donovan Mitchell  -Stephen Curry  -Devin Booker  -Trae Young  -John Wall  -Damian Lillard  -DeAaron Fox  -Zach Lavine   As well as front court players like:   -Joel Embiid  -Giannis Antetokounmpo  -LeBron James  -Kevin Durant  But hey, keep shouting nonsense into the wind. We need more jokes around here."
"Both of the Nuggets series for me, for different reasons the first round sing Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell just absolutely go out it was phenomenal shet, and then the Clippers series, Once they went up 3 games to 1 we were all ready for the Battle of Los Angeles, and then they kept blowing all these multiple leads which led to an absolute shitshow and beautiful NBA Twitter after game 7üòÇüòÇüòÇ"

Okay so Rudy led the jazz to a 5th seed with a rookie Donovan Mitchell averaging 20/4/4 on 54ts% as his next best player. Without him that year they had a losing record and a bottom third defense.
"&gt;You aren‚Äôt winning a championship with Marseille Mozgov  Elaborate please because if you mean as your best player than i agree but neither can you with like 95% of the players who signed max deals. If you mean it as Rudy can never win a ring than you are dumb as their biggest problem is their best scorer, Donovan Mitchell (also maxed), isn't good enough to carry a team to a ring like Kawhi, Durant, Curry and Lebron."
"2nd lowest 3 point percentage on the list behind Donovan Mitchell but Ant is 19 and definitely should be improving, heck he is already showing great strides since Finch."
With both Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley out it provably won't be that hard for Pheonix.
"Booker and Donovan Mitchell are both in interesting spots as young stars on legit championship contenders. If they win it all (and perform) it will open the door for them to become the next real star of the NBA as the old guard (LBJ, KD, Steph, Harden) start dropping off.  Right now no young guys have really stepped up,  Giannis and JOKIC kind of come to mind but in my memory the league has never seen a main star from outside of the USA so they'd both have to win AND be very very dominant to claim the crown. Zion may have a chance when he gets off the pelicans, and I really hope Randle becomes the next face of the NBA personally, but I don't see him getting the wins as a Knick.  As it stands Booker and Mitchell are in with a huge opportunity to really elevate their status in the nba if they can lead their teams to victory this year."
"To be fair, Donovan Mitchell was out for both of the last two games against them, and Mike Conley was out for another. Turns out teams struggle when 1-2 of their best players is missing. Weird."
"If he‚Äôs not a deterrent at the rim he can get exposed in the playoffs. Even tho Jokic is a great playoff player, he gets exposed on defense by small guards driving into him and bigger guys taking him to school (Donovan Mitchell, Anthony Davis)  Not that it matters tho since he‚Äôs the best offensive player in the league lol."
But the good thing is we will get to see other young talent like Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell in the west And hopefully Trae Young in the east
Idk man. We haven‚Äôt seen playoff book. Could be like Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell where he just goes nuclear in the playoffs. Plus you already know Chris Paul is gonna step up his game
I guarantee you it'll be easier to game plan for MPJ than Jamal Murray/Donovan Mitchell/Devin Booker.
"Yeah he definitely hasn't always been aggressive and that's the consistency that keeps him from being better. But that's a learned skill. The difference between Donovan Mitchell and Steph Curry (among other things) is not that Mitchell can't score 30 he absolutely can, it's that Steph can do so on a way more consistent basis. That's why he's a superstar and not simply a star.   It's not just Ben deciding to be aggressive or not though, there's a ton of different factors including how he is being reffed and defended. As his game grows his performance will be less volatile based on these outside factors and he will be more consistent simply because he's better at doing the things he's already good at. And other things obviously that he's not good at."
Donovan Mitchell
"You see this is a conversation I can have. I disagree with some of your points but honestly I don't even care. I'm just impressed that unlike 90% of this thread you don't think Ben ""is not trying to improve.""   It's a results based business I get that, but the notion that Ben is satisfied with where he is and is ""actively trying to not improve"" (yes these are actual quotes from people in this thread) is ludicrous. He never said he is a role player or that he's happy being one. He said he's playing a role on the team, and that everyone has their role to play. Too many people are being purposefully dense and acting like they don't know the difference between the common sports label of ""role player"" and playing one's role on the team. Donovan Mitchell role is to score. They need him to create for himself in the halfcourt (especially in years past) and score because they don't have (again, moreso in past seasons) too many that can get a shot for themselves.   Ben is obviously working on improving as a scorer as well as the other aspects of his game. Anyone with half a brain would know that even if his trainer didn't release videos the last couple of summers (before the pandemic obviously). He and the Sixers clearly don't think those aspects of his game that are poor would help the team if he did them more in games. They have a system that maximizes his skills, even in the halfcourt. I know people think Ben's man can just help off of him but if you watch the film that's simply not the case. Anyway so yes he is working to improve his game but the shooting is just not at a point where it can help the team, so they use the aspects of his game that can. Extreme example but Joel works on his handles but he's not gonna be our lead ball handler. Would we be more dangerous if Ben could score better? Absolutely. But we have to use what we have at the moment."
"neither of the brooklyn guards have had a first-team caliber season compared to their peers. steph, luka, dame, chris paul, argubly even devin booker, and donovan mitchell have better cases than them."
Donovan Mitchell is good but not a HOF player right now.  And Gobert‚Äôs 12 ppg isn‚Äôt going to help you guys against players like Jokic Embiid AD
"Totally agree, and I also think you can't discount the fact that Dame has two historically awesome series-clinching shots.  Like his numbers + his moments have to put him above.  To just outright declare Mitchell is better in the playoffs than Dame and Jokic is absurd.  Giannis and Embiid are arguable, but definitely agree that Dame is in the Jokic category of ""uhhh dude Donovan isnt easily better in the playoffs than these dudes"""
"man do u watch basketball?  take the blazers-pelicans series for example. if u watched that and watched jazz playoff games, you'd see that donovan mitchell has *never* faced the defensive attention and schemes that dame has faced. never.  now, spida's a baller and maybe he'll get to that point in his prime. we'll see. but so far, no way lol.  yall just look at box score numbers and no context.  this is the problem with comparing dame to kyrie as well. kyrie never faced those defensive schemes in the playoffs. he's never gotten doubled and trapped like that."
Donovan mitchell is a star
"The wing defense isn't great, and no Superstar, I like Donovan Mitchell but I can't put him in that Superstar class yet and more often than not you need a superstar player to win a championship, maybe he takes it to that level this year but I doubt it, but they have home court on their side and a solid team all around let's see what they can do"
Same guy who wildly kicked his leg out for no reason and hurt Donovan Mitchell
Chris Paul?  Donovan Mitchell?
Donovan Mitchell and cp3 first team?
"Is Gobert even the most valuable player on his own team? Maybe, maybe not. But if you can't definitively answer that, and we know that Donovan Mitchell is nowhere close to the MVP, it's hard to say Gobert should be an MVP candidate."
"I mean that whole time during the Ad saga the narrative was the Celtics had the better trade package. It was just that when push came to shove Ainge wouldn't trade him. However, part of that could be Ad's refusal to commit to them and his dad and agent openly saying it would a rental.  If Lebron had joined the Celtics Ad would have committed, and Tatum would be gone.  People did not know Jackson/Exum/Fultz were bad players at the time. They were still green lotto picks. And these secondary guys don't even matter. It's the main that does like a Donovan Mitchell. Any team would be happy to get him if forced to lose their franchise player. Mitchell and a bunch of picks/young players would do it. Especially after that postseason he had."
"&gt;  seeding is the most important factor in MVP historically  But it's really not.  It's a factor, but even then, it has more to do with any team having a tendency to be very good if they have a guy putting up MVP caliber stats on it.    Besides, odds are the Lakers wouldn't have had the top record anyway.  They were 28-13 with Lebron for a .683 PCT.  If Lebron played every game and that percentage held, they'd be currently only tied for 3rd in the West with the Clippers, behind both the Jazz and the Suns.  Further to it, if your premise were at all valid, Donovan Mitchell would be right up there at the top of the race.  Yet here we are crowning Jokic, who will realistically only be a 4/5 seed.  The MVP goes to the player with the best stats on a good team."
"So lets compare it to this year. Lebron, Kawhi, and Jokic had the 3 starter spots he would compete with.  The reserves are a bit tricky because there are at least 3 forward reserves but he would also be competing with guards for the last spots. AD, Paul George, Gobert, and Zion were the other forwards. The reserve guards were Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Booker, and Chris Paul.   That is tight competition. His post all star stats of 22/8 with boom or bust defense would put him just outside of that for this year.   He would need a jump in numbers (very possible) and some health luck, and some wins. It is possible, but there is no certainty at all. Especially as one of those guards got in because AD didnt play the all-star game due to injury."
"That was not the opinion at the time. Jayson Tatum was the prize and the Celtics had Jaylen Brown too. Especially since Julius Randle left in free agency and was not on the team Lebron joined.  But there were many other teams. For example the Suns, who had Devin Booker and Josh Jackson. The Jazz with Donovan Mitchell and Dante Exum. The Sixers with Simmons and Fultz. Heck he could have gone to the Timberwolves and flipped KAT for Ad."
"I love to dunk on the Jazz but, to be fair, I think it was really more adidas pushing it more than he was. The sweatshirt and the [billboard](https://twitter.com/E_Woodyard/status/989978979380555776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E989978979380555776%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbleacherreport.com%2Farticles%2F2773026-donovan-mitchell-adidas-rookie-of-the-year-campaign-hits-salt-lake-billboard) were cringy, but I would be surprised if it was actually his idea."
One first round exit and all of a sudden the Jazz aren't in playoff contention anymore? Donovan Mitchell is a whole different beast in the playoffs and Bogie is actually healthy this year. Anything can happen and that's the wonderful thing about the NBA!
Something impressive about CJ's assist numbers is how low TO's he gets. Compare him with Donovan Mitchell or Booker for example it really stands out.
I suppose it's all the Donovan Mitchell stans
"Nuggets ""got"" Donovan Mitchell at 13 the year before.  What could've been"
"It sounds like you made some huge inferences that I wasn't implying.  Literally all I said was ""Book is playing beside CP3.  Donovan carries a larger load on offense.  That doesn't mean I'm dismissing how good his role players are, it literally means he plays a larger role in setting up his team's offense, especially down the stretch.  He is the primary ball handler more than Book is because Book plays beside CP3, who is arguably their best player on offense.  Like you made some wild leaps if that's what you thought my original comment meant.  I then tried to explain myself but it seems like you sorta misunderstood my point in the first place.  I literally just said Book plays beside CP3 and Mitchell carries a larger load on offense because he doesn't play beside someone like CP3.  Do you disagree with that?"
"wow so Donovan Mitchell vs Devin Booker is turning into a thing, huh? fuck the LA teams this is the WCF we need."
Donovan Mitchell is out.  You guys are fine.  You guys took 57 3's and made sub 30% of them.  Clarkson isn't typically this bad for you.  you're fine.
Save us Donovan Mitchell!
"Apparently Donovan Mitchell is ok at basketball, who knew?"
I miss Donovan Mitchell
"If Rudy can get $200 million for 12 ppg, then Donovan Mitchell should get $400 million."
"Donovan Mitchell should at least make third team. 26/5/4 on .57 ts% (38.5% on 3s at almost 10 attempts per game)  More importantly, he‚Äôs the clear offensive leader on the team with the leagues best record. That‚Äôs gotta count for something."
"Just curious why you have Booker in over Mitchell? Donovan has the edge in points/rebounds/assists per game while Booker has slightly higher TS% (.585 for Book to Mitchell‚Äôs .569). Mitchell is also shooting better on 3s at a higher volume and is the clear number 1 offensive option on the leagues best team (record wise).   Love Book and honestly would be fine with him in, just wondering if there‚Äôs a reason for not mentioning Mitchell"
Me too. Donovan Mitchell has been playing shitty and the Jazz probably won't be the first seed. Makes sense.
"I hope for him to be another KD type scoring beast. Realistically, if he developes into a Jayson Tatum or even Donovan Mitchell type player, that would be all you want from him and a bag of chips"
"Hi Jayson,  I‚Äôve been a huge fan of yours since your Duke days, you and Donovan Mitchell have been the backbones of my fantasy teams the last 3 years. My question is, how did your training with Kobe change the way you mentally prepare and train as opposed to before? A select few have been lucky enough to work with him and Id love to hear all you can tell!"
"It doesn‚Äôt. At the end of the day, all advanced metrics are flawed in the sense that it‚Äôs impossible to actually separate your contribution from your teammates over the course of 1 season. You need a 5 year sample size of you playing in a bunch of different line ups to do it properly. The jazz have like the 3rd best offense in the league, gobert plays a lot of minutes and shares those minutes with mike Conley and Donovan mitchell and shooters. It‚Äôs also the reason Mike Conley is rated as like a top 3 defender this season in most advanced metrics.  Edit: al horford has certain 5 year rapm samples that he is ranked higher offensively in than any sample of gobert"
"Harden was 6th in overall raptor in 2013-2014 and like 5th in 2014-2015. Pretty much every advanced metric on the planet would say harden even back then was having wayyy better seasons than mitchell is right now, hence the mvp consideration. If mitchell were a near super star as the 1st seed in the west, he would see some mvp talk, especially in a year where they‚Äôre about to have to give it to a 4th seed guy or someone who‚Äôs been injured. Obviously, you‚Äôre way higher on Mitchell‚Äôs game than everyone else.   Also, I was only listing possible competition for mitchell, not saying that for sure all of those people will be better. Ja is the most unlikely out of everyone I mentioned.   Also, it‚Äôs basically a fact that you can‚Äôt have 20 super stars in the game at one time. There‚Äôs only a certain amount of finals and mvps to go around, and at the end of the day, people are gonna break everyone down into tiers like they always do, and if youre not in that upper echelon then you‚Äôre not a super star.   Also, yes, Donovan mitchell has had some great playoff moments, but there‚Äôs a lot more to go and I‚Äôm pretty sure when all is said and done, over the next decade there will be a solid 5-10 players who end up with better accolades than mitchell (rings, mvps, all nba selections)."
"My mistake, I meant to be comparing 24 yr old Harden to Donovan Mitchell, so the 13/14 season.  Are you setting a limit of how many superstars their can be? All of those guys you listed are on the same tier as Mitchell, except Morant lmao, the dude is shooting 29% from 3, if you think he has a better chance at being a superstar than idk what to tell you, especially considering that‚Äôs the focal point of today‚Äôs game. You are also listing players that have proven far less than Mitchell. He averaged 36/6/6 in the playoffs, and as a rookie he knocked out PG and the former MVP."
"Ok, harden in 2015 was the second highest scorer in the league. Donovan mitchell is 11th this year. You‚Äôre committing the same error people make when they compare true shooting percentages across eras. A lot has changed in basketball since warriors mania.   I never said Donovan mitchell will not improve, but there are a lot of players that are also young that are more likely to be the next generation of ‚Äúsuper stars.‚Äù Luka and giannis are already superstars. Zion already seems more likely to be a super star than mitchell. To name a few others, we got Devin booker, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Ja Morant, and then a few more that I really think will be better even though there‚Äôs not a lot to go on I.e. lamelo ball and Michael Porter jr. Not to mention there will be more and more players pouring into the league, other guys that improve as well like maybe Anthony Edwards, and some current super stars that are still decently young like Anthony Davis and will be taking up those spots for the next while in Mitchell‚Äôs career.   Basically, I don‚Äôt really believe mitchell will ever be a borderline top 5 player and I actually believe he‚Äôll probably stay at around 15-20 for most of his career  Edit: ad is actually 28, but there‚Äôs others like jokic that are 26 and will be considered better than mitchell for like the next 6 to 8 years probably"
"He is on the ‚Äúverge‚Äù meaning not yet but he‚Äôs close. Do you think he‚Äôs gonna stop improving even though he‚Äôs improved in every aspect every single year? Are you saying Donovan Mitchell will never be a superstar even though he‚Äôs 24 years old averaging almost 27 ppg. At 24 years old Dame was averaging 21 ppg, and look at him now?"
"If every team started from scratch and were given the option between 14/15 Horford or Donovan Mitchell to start a team , 30/30 teams pick Donovan Mitchell."
"Donovan Mitchell has similar numbers to James Harden in 2015 and Harden was a top 15 player then. Mitchell isn‚Äôt a top 15 player right now but he‚Äôs somewhere between 16-21. There is way more talent in the league now than there was in 2015, so comparing their respective rankings in the league is irrelevant. You can‚Äôt tell me that a team with Al Horford as the main offensive threat has an equal chance at the title as a Donovan Mitchell led team. You could also make the argument that Gobert is better than Horford."
"You realize that in most people‚Äôs lists, Donovan mitchell is like the 20th best player in the nba right? You don‚Äôt think al Horford was maybe the 20th best player in the league in 2015?"
"I appreciate that you have a different opinion and don't appear to be trolling and actually genuinely think this. I just disagree.  RJ looks like he's on Tatum's career path. He has so far lived up to expectations and if he takes another jump next year, which I think he definitely will barring injury, it would be a waste to trade him away.   Robinson is a legit interior defender. He actually is great defending the 3 as well, though obviously we don't want him out there regularly.    IQ has shown a lot of promise as a rookie. Much more than Toppin. He has for stretches looked better than RJ last year and is one of the best rookies we've had in recent memory along with RJ and Porzingis.  Uncanny ability to draw fouls and being a top 10 FT shooter (as a rookie is insane) is also an underrated aspect of his game.  As I said before, only Book, Luka or Donovan Mitchell for me."
Name one player on the Hawks that was even close to as good as Donovan Mitchell
"No, I copy pasted his post below:  Look at past drafts:   2018: Ayton v. SGA 2017: Fultz v. Donovan Mitchell or Bam 2016: Simmons v. Sabonis 2015: KAT v Devin Booker 2014: Wiggins v Jokic 2013: Anthony Bennet v. Giannis 2012: AD v Draymond 2011: Kyrie v Kawhi 2010: John Wall v Paul George  I‚Äôd take the 10th pick in 2018, 2017, 2014, 2013, 2011, 2010.   2015 is a wash"
"Exactly. The Clippers would have won if they'd stayed healthy and everyone else had got hurt like they did. But if everyone else was fully healthy then I don't think they'd have gone any further than they did. They may not have even gone that far, especially if Mike Conley and Donovan Mitchell had been 100% in the second round."
"Have a hunch that the Jazz will be the team to knock out the Lakers next year and Gobert will have his redemption arc, it seems every year there's a star player who was slandered profusely the previous year has a bounce back and gets vindicated the next year.   Plus the Lakers were probably the best equipped team of anybody in the league to stop Donovan Mitchell this past year with their array of perimeter defenders, and all those players with the exception of Caruso, who probably can't coexist with Russ, are now gone."
He got more scoring opportunities. It‚Äôs a lot of players that are good defenders but as soon as they get the ball more on offense they stop caring as much   Donovan Mitchell was an amazing defender in college really doesn‚Äôt try hard anymore
Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker should at LEAST get honorable mentions
"In no particular order:  1.	‚Å†Giannis  Arguably the best player in the world today and he‚Äôs only 26. Unless he becomes riddled with injuries, it‚Äôs very unlikely we see him drop off in the next 5 years  2. Luka Doncic  Luka will be 27 and in the prime of his career. He‚Äôs already found his way into some MVP conversations at 22 and it‚Äôs not hard to imagine he‚Äôll win the award sometime in the next 5 years.  3. Zion Williamson  The man is already averaging 27ppg in his first full season. I can easily see him improving over the next few years to become a top 5 player in the league  4. Donovan Mitchell  At 24 years old, Donovan Mitchell is already among the best guards in the league. When you look at Dame and Curry, and you compare their games from when they were 30yrs old to when they 24/25yrs old, you can see they improved a ton and really took their game to the next level. Who‚Äôs to say Donovan Mitchell won‚Äôt do the same.  5. Deandre Ayton  This ones a reach, I know, but it‚Äôs kind of boring if I make my list too safe. Don‚Äôt really have a good reason for why this would happen lol, but here‚Äôs my hot take: Booker and Ayton will start to get Kobe &amp; Shaq comparisons 5 years from now  Additional notes:  I could‚Äôve put ‚Äúsomeone who hasn‚Äôt been drafted yet‚Äù because there‚Äôs a great chance another Derrick rose or Luka doncic comes into the league (especially in this 2021 draft class), but I wanted to keep it to players in the league rn."
Bruh these mfers hand out defensive ratings like candy  Donovan Mitchell is an A defender
"He's shown flashes I think he still has a lot of potential. Best of luck. I will miss him.  Always brought a lot of excitement. I think the ""drug problem"" narrative is a bit ridiculous. He's a young guy and made a couple mistakes. Seems to have really grown out of that. I hope he goes to a team that he has a more prominent role. If so he can still surprise some people.   I disagree with a lot of your takes but I will say, He is a disappointment ultimately though. Especially when you consider we drafted him over Donovan Mitchell and Coach Clip was literally begging MJ to take Mitchell over Monk."
"combo guard, like Donovan Mitchell mostly SG tho"
"Dude was selected 5 spots ahead of Donovan Mitchell, goddamn"
"Because Donovan kicks it into a higher gear in the playoffs. He has ever since his rookie year. 120 average regular season games don't matter compared to ten, twenty, thirty exceptional playoff games because the playoffs are where you have to put it all on the line to excel. Balling out in the regular season is great if you want to rack up individual accolades, but playoff performances matter *way more* in determining the actual strength of a player. If you can go from being a 24ppg moderately efficient scorer in the regular season to a 29ppg super-efficient flamethrower in the playoffs and you can do it with consistency, then you're not a middle-of-the-road fringe all-star guy, you're a superstar. Mitchell has, among all active players, the second highest playoff PPG in the NBA after Kevin Durant. Even counting small-sample size guys like Booker who had his first playoffs run this year, and looked really good. Guys who take it up another level in the playoffs are just more valuable than players who might be identical to them in the regular season.  You mentioned matchup being a complicating factor, so we can expand the range a little bit if you want - go from just the last two years to the last four, which means Dame should theoretically be really heavily advantaged thanks to his WCF run during the year the Raptors won plus the fact that he's just been in this league for a longer time, whereas Mitchell starts this comparison as a rookie and he had to play against a very scary switching Rockets defense *twice*where he was the only shot creator on the team. In theory, Dame should be heavily favored because he *also* got to play against a worse version of that Nuggets team that Mitchell torched, plus a pretty weak Spurs roster.   Dame's stats are 41.9/38.8/88.3 shooting splits with counting totals of 26.9/4.5/6.9 and a true shooting of 58.2% if we want to round favorably for him, all in approximately 40 minutes per game.   Mitchell's stats are 43.6/39.4/86.2 shooting splits, with counting totals of 28.8/5.1/4.6 and a true shooting of 56.7% (again, rounded up just a touch) in about 37 minutes per game.  So the takeaway here is that in spite of two really bad series against the Rockets in a very unfavorable matchup, Mitchell is actually a *little bit more efficient* shooting from the floor than Dame is, buuut he doesn't quite get to the line as much as Lillard does, and Dame's shot profile is a little bit cleaner, which means he has a bit higher TS% over the last four years in the playoffs. Like I said, this is a game of inches in terms of pure scoring, and about 2-3 assists per game which is, I admit, a meaningful difference between the two - it's not a meaningful enough one to act as though the gulf between these two players is super significant though, and that Mitchell and Dame shouldn't be spoken of as similar-caliber players. While I wouldn't rank either one in my top five, I think Dame has a good case for fringe top-ten, and I think Mitchell has a case for being a fringe top-15 guy, and I don't think that the gulf between those two spots is nearly as large as like ""top ten versus top seven or eight"" and ""top seven or eight versus top 3""."
The median pick at 9 is Derozan.  All this article really proves is that for some reason teams that pick 8th are just way worse at picking than 9th.  Also he's still a bust.  How are there still Knicks fans arguing that a dude drafted before Donovan Mitchell and Bam Adebayo isn't a bust?
You're assuming Steve Clifford wouldn't have stashed Donovan Mitchell behind MCW until midseason
"Donovan is great, but honestly I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs really that close to Dame.  Mitchell‚Äôs efficiency is league average and at 26 PPG that is a great place to be, don‚Äôt get me wrong. But Dame is another level. He‚Äôs good for a few more PPG than Mitchell with 6 percentage points better in TS.  That‚Äôs just a crazy margin alone, not even considering Dame‚Äôs playmaking."
"You can‚Äôt sit here and say well among PG I have him as 17th in the whole league and out of the other side of the mouth say he should play next to someone who can be more on the ball in the half court. If you look at just guards there are so many, so many guards you‚Äôd rather have. You don‚Äôt have Booker on your list? You don‚Äôt have Jamal Murray? Donovan Mitchell? Beal? Lavine? Irving? Harden? Brown? McCollum?   Like who did he have a better season than last year? Was he better than terry rozier? Was be better than FVV? Tim Hardaway and Norman Powell are both coming off two very strong seasons in a row, both FA, both 28, was Lonzo better than either of them? Let‚Äôs just be honest."
"Well since we're just throwing shit at a wall that could eventually be true in half a decade: ""sources indicate to me Jayson  Tatum and Donovan Mitchell will team up on the Lakers down the line"""
"Would you guys say Hakeem has the best rookie season to not win rookie of the year? When you look at stats it could be Carmelo or Donovan Mitchell too, but I just don't know the context behind all of their years. There's probably multiple others that slipped right by me, but what are your guys thoughts? I mean Hakeem averaged a double double"
"That 2017 draft doesn't just count as one mistake, it was a tremendous failure on multiple fronts. We had 3 first round picks and could've walked away with: John Collins (@ #15), Jarrett Allen/OG Anunoby (@ #20), and Kyle Kuzma/Derrick White/Josh Hart/Dillon Brooks (@ #26).  Or if we still made our trade of #15 + #20 for #10, we could have taken Bam Adebayo or Donovan Mitchell there.  Instead of getting any ONE of those players above, we walked away with Zach Collins and Caleb Swanigan. And even if Zach Collins were healthy, he looks like a serviceable rotation player, not a star, and certainly not someone who would've pushed us to the next level. That draft was nothing short of an unmitigated disaster."
"Remind me what changed when he got PG13 and Anthony for a supposed big three? Did anything change? Oh yeah, they improved their season wins by 1 LOL.  Also, what happened to Oladipo that year after leaving Thunder? Did he not become an all-star with the pacers?  Also, wasn't WB the same guy that got smoked by a non-shooting Ben Simmons, an average starting PG Ricky Rubio, and a rookie Donovan Mitchell? LOLOLOL  Russ is not perfect because he's more of a liability than an asset. Only casuals are impressed with his ""effort"" when he doesn't play defense consistently and off-ball properly."
you act like they had a choice in contending. they lost in the 1st round to a rookie Donovan Mitchell
"Ok replace them with donovan mitchell, jayson tatum, KAT or Zion. Still doesnt make sense."
"Donovan Mitchell brings excellent value at 6'1""."
"Ah yes, ignorance...when one of us is backed by stats and the other talks out of their ass.   Carmelo's 1.03 ppp in isolation was better than Donovan Mitchell, Lebron, Devin Booker, and Jayson Tatum. Good for 78th percentile in the league. He was getting double teamed in the playoff in isolation situations.   You dont know what you're talking about."
Remember when ESPN put Tatum #5 in their top 25 under 25? They put him below LaMelo Ball and Donovan Mitchell lmao
"&gt;it‚Äôs greatly exaggerated the impact of a workout performance leading up to the draft.  Utah and other teams had NO IDEA who Donovan Mitchell was. Utah GM is on record saying, if anyone drafts this kid before us, im firing the everyone present @ this workout cuz it was leaked to another team. Thats how impactful Mitchell's workout was for Utah.   I think you saying workout preformances greatly exaggerates the process is an exaggeration. Way too much of a blanket statement. Certainly outliers can exist. Bam is another pick that happened likely because of his workout preformance...and now we have Scottie Barnes on this list too. Obviously a great workout =/= stardom, but it is very clearly an important part of the scouting process"
Idk. We had CJ and Dame.  And I wouldn‚Äôt have minded drafting Donovan Mitchell too‚Ä¶
"Chriss Broussard \[Sources\]: Donovan Mitchell is beside himself, driving around downtown Salt Lake City begging (thru texts) Rudy Goburt for address to Mike Conley's home."
"Best case scenario he‚Äôs a Devin Booker Donovan Mitchell caliber player. Worst case scenario he‚Äôs out of the league by the end of his rookie deal.   Great prospect but IMO he‚Äôs the definition of boom or bust. If he booms he‚Äôs going to be a star, if he busts it‚Äôs going to be very ugly."
"Shai had that whole ""this years donovan Mitchell"" thing entering the draft tho  also fuck that guy has improved considerably since his rookie year on LAC"
"I really got to read names first or see if I got dyslexia, I thought that said Donovan Mitchell"
I think DeMar did a great job as a leader in the locker room to the young guys and as a primary initiator.  One of the common trends we see in teams who have trouble developing young talent is not providing the prospects with solid NBA-level guard play. This is even true for young guards.  Learning how to effectively initiate an offense is probably the most difficult learning curve in the NBA for young players and having a solid vet show you how it's done can change the course of a player's development..  Shai had Lou Williams and Pat Bev in his rookie year with LAC  Jamal Murray had Jameer Nelson his rookie year.  Donovan Mitchell had Rick Rubio his rookie year.  Trae Young had Vince Carter and Jeremy Lin during his rookie year.. and there's a ton of other examples.
"Jokic, Luka, Jamal Murray, Steph, Klay, PG13, Kahwi, LeBron, AD, Ja Morant, CP3, Booker, DeAaron Fox,  Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Trae, Tatum, KD, Harden, Kyrie, LaMelo, Bam, Giannis, Holiday, Khris Middleton, Embiid, Lowry, Beal are all better"
"donovan mitchell, ban adebayo, jamal murray, pascal siakam, myles turner, devin booker, marcus smart, jusuf nurkic, clint capela, cj mccollum, rudy gobert, damian lillaird, draymond green, kemba walker, klay thompson, and jimmy butler‚Ä¶ are all players within the last 10 years drafted after the number 5 pick.   your point still stands but it also shows that you can get some pretty damn good - truly great players if you hit on your picks."
Donovan Mitchell? Devin Booker? Kyrie?
Donovan Mitchell too
if I'm donovan mitchell I force out over this
"I can make a list of point guards better than him and then add on other guys as well from other positions and he's clearly in the 30 to 40 range as a player.  Off the top of my head.  CP3 Steph Dame Trae Young Jrue Holiday Ja Morant Kyrie Irving are all point guards better than Russ.  You can argue Ben Simmons (I won't) but that's the range where Russ is.  And then we have players who are better like Beal, Bam, Butler, PG 13, Middleton, Booker, Tatum, Lavine, Jaylen Brown, Gobert, KAT.  And then you add Harden Lebron Jokic AD Giannis Luka Kawhi Donovan Mitchell so yeah he's in the thirties clearly."
"The ones that become great players are the exceptions. The odds are that most of these picks will never amount to more than role players. Yes, picks like Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell have proven to defy this, but the overwhelming majority don't. Y'all only really remember the hits, but a lot of the busts go forgotten. Either way, I don't agree with wasting a potential top 15 player of all times late prime trying to rebuild"
Westbrook is a better player than Donovan Mitchell bro what. Be quiet
The guy looks like if Zach LaVine and Donovan Mitchell had a son
Jared Butler will be the steal of this draft. No idea how he's in 40. Donovan Mitchell 2.0
Reminds me of Donovan Mitchell
Davion Mitchell and Donovan Mitchell (not actually brothers though)
Donovan Mitchell came off COVID and was dropping 50 bombs. several Heat players had COVID and made the Finals
Hes worse than donovan Mitchell and Booker
"I agree, at least to a certain extent. The game isnt played on a stats sheet, but these people will tell you Donovan Mitchell is not goos because he shoots 43% from the field."
Donovan Mitchell is 6'1 lol
I'm getting flashbacks to Donovan Mitchell or Malik Monk and I don't like how it ended up last time
"Plus, he‚Äôll probably confuse many a coach/commentator/fan between a Donovan and Devion Mitchell.  It‚Äôs going to happen; trust me!"
Took me too long to know if he and Donovan Mitchell were brothers or not. Didn't help they have the same number etc.
"Baylor employed, er, I mean, *had on their roster* last year: a guard who was built like, played like, and wore #45 like, Donovan Mitchell named ""Davion Mitchell"" and a big man named ""Flo Thamba."" INVESTIGATE?"
"Hahahah I was waiting for the Donovan Mitchell comparison to dovian Mitchell, so lazy"
Davion Mitchell reminds me of Donovan Mitchell because the name is similar - ESPN
The analytical front office didnt pick the #1 guy based on analytics lol?  They picked #45 Mitchell thinkin it was Donovan Mitchell /s
He does look like Donovan Mitchell from behind
Little offended he hasn‚Äôt asked for Donovan Mitchell and some of that sweet magic Mormon underwear (google it).
Free my man Donovan Mitchell
Harrison Barnes- US Senator  Pat Riley- Mafia Boss   Gordon Hayward- Pro Gamer   Donovan Mitchell- Arachnologist   Rajon Rondo- Chess world champion  Jaylen Brown- Professor at a university   Damien Lillard- Rolex salesman   Markelle Fultz- Chick-fil-A manager   Chris Paul- High school principal  Serge Ibaka- Gourmet chef  PJ Tucker- Cobbler
2017 - Number 13 pick is Donovan Mitchell   2021 - Number 13 pick is Davion Mitchell. Anotha spida coming?
Yeah but his name is close to Donovan Mitchell and they have the same number
I disagree. I think Donovan Mitchell has some fire shoes imo
Nuggets legends Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert agree
Nuggets legends Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell agree
"And you‚Äôre a dry ass hater who doesn‚Äôt know basketball if you think DBook creates more contact to get fouls more than Luka, Trae, Harden, Butler, Dame, and Donovan Mitchell"
"I appreciate different viewpoints but I don‚Äôt totally understand or agree with your methodology  More interested in analyzing last year‚Äôs than disagreeing with this year‚Äôs, but the analysis of Vassell and Halliburton feels pretty wrong to me. Both are really nice players, I had both in my top 10, but the player comps seem way, way off. Halliburton is kinda nothing like a Kyrie or Kemba, he‚Äôs a way different kind of guard without anywhere near that level of self-creation. In my view, Vassell‚Äôs a lot more of a versatile wing with some creation upside, a la early career Middleton. I don‚Äôt really see the Donovan Mitchell, electric scoring guard comparison at all."
"Look up some Donovan Mitchell articles before his draft. Insane workout, wanted to be a Piston, wanted to be in Detroit. It was a no brainer and we know how it played out."
"The last time we passed on someone who had a godly workout was Donovan Mitchell, so... Regardless, I thought having the #1 pick would be comforting. It is somehow more nerve wracking."
Luka Doncic and Donovan Mitchell tore that duo to shreds. I think they're pretty overrated as a defensive duo and have been cruising on reputation for some time now.
Gordon. The guy who locked up Donovan Mitchell in two playoff series
Why not? How many young All Stars locked up in contracts are going to be ahead of him if one of those players became available? Guys like Donovan Mitchell and Tre Young are their teams best players. Brown is in a unique situation where he may be a tier below those guys but he is actually expendable in that type of trade
"I was curious, so I looked up how many teams have been able to draft an all-star outside the top ten picks of the draft since 2013. Here's the complete list.  Denver - Jokic and potentially MPJ  LAC - SGA  Miami - Bam and maybe Herro  Milwaukie - Giannis  Minnesota - Zach Lavine  OKC - Sabonis  Phoenix - Booker  Toronto - Siakam  Utah - Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert  Honorable mentions  Atlanta - No but John Collins is close  Kings - Potentially Haliburton in the future  That's an average of a little more than one all-star per year. Again, I'm intending to defend Neil Olshey here, but so many blazers fans have it in their head that we were ""just a good pick"" away from contending, as though any team is able to consistently find all-stars at the back half of the draft."
"Lol this sub has no idea what they‚Äôre talking about, Booker averaged 26 on 60% TS this year despite being 17th in free throw attempts.   Booker does all of these less than Harden, Trae, Luka, Jimmy Butler, Bradley Beal, Dame, and Donovan Mitchell. Y‚Äôall just dry ass haters who don‚Äôt know ball."
Donovan Mitchell
"Why is there a need for that restriction? Lol. You can‚Äôt take it that the USA is just better overall. Plus, who could go against this kind of lineup:  PG: Trae Young, Jalen Suggs SG: Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown SF: Jayson Tatum, Mikal Bridges, Trey Murphy PF: Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis C: Evan Mobley, Myles Turner   Show me an all Euro lineup under 30 that‚Äôs better than all those all stars lol"
It's Donovan Mitchell actually
donovan mitchell
Donovan Mitchell would like a word. Man had the highest 3 pointers scored all the way till the finals last I checked lol and the Jazz got taken out pretty quick and some other good stats. Gobert is a beast but Donovan is a better player raw talent wise imo
Who‚Äôs this Donovan Mitchell I only know Danavon Motcholl of the Otoh Jozz
I thought Donovan Mitchell was like 6‚Äô4 wtf
27 teams could've had Rudy Gobert  13 teams could've had Donovan Mitchell  All 30 teams could've had Draymond Green  All 30 teams could've had Nikola Jokic  We can play this game all day lol
"OG's good, but people would still talk about you guys missing out on Mitchell. He's too great of a player not to  A Jamal/Donovan backcourt could've been filthy"
"LOL Denver must be trying to redeem themselves for ever trading the pick that was Donovan Mitchell. Now they can draft Davion, squint real hard and convince themselves they never made a mistake back in 2017"
We‚Äôre about to have Donovan and Davion Mitchell with both wearing 45
Only cuz he‚Äôs lebron if Donovan Mitchell was averaging the numbers lebron was he wouldn‚Äôt be in the same conversation. There wasn‚Äôt a point he was the best player last season
Then you should wait until he gets one or two all-stars to say that. Devin Booker looks like a perennial all-star. Donovan Mitchell looks like perennial all-star.  Guys that haven‚Äôt even made it once don‚Äôt ‚Äúlook like‚Äù they can do it *consistently*.
Donovan Mitchell is smiling somewhere rn.
"Kawhi is too quiet and shy to hold resentment towards imo, he doesn‚Äôt bother anybody and isn‚Äôt trying to be anything other than a basketball player.   I hold the opposite approach, we support them for their talent not their personality. Wanting Donovan Mitchell over KD for your team because he‚Äôs nice just sounds stupid to me sorry"
Would it have been a good idea for the Hawks to instead trade Luka for Donovan Mitchell on draft night?
"Yeah you lost when you made this comment. Kawhi, even with his load management and dodgy uncle, is a much better have than Lavine. He‚Äôs a different realm of player it‚Äôs like saying you‚Äôd rather Donovan Mitchell over Kevin Durant"
i‚Äôd rather take cade and regret it later than see him be good somewhere else.  please. i‚Äôve watched us fumble pick after pick. we coulda had giannis one year but he was such a project and from another country im not going to include him.  recently   2013 we took kcp and coulda had CJ Mccollum  2014 no pick  2015 stanley johnson over myles turner and booker  2016 ellenson. coulda had lavert but this is outside the lottery so im not trippin  2017 this is the one that makes me want to blow my brains out. luke fucking kennard over donovan mitchell. (also coulda got bam)  2018 no pick  2019 dekou he‚Äôs a bust but was outside the lottery and no other pick was really worthwhile after besides thybulle and kpj.  please for the love of god just take cade.
Maybe Donovan Mitchell?
"It is kind of fun to claim that Donovan Mitchell was a Nuggets and have proof of it. Actually, it is silly but whatever makes the NBA works"
All I know is Denver traded Utah two first round picks in two separate trades that would become Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell. And the Gobert pick was exchanged for *cash considerations.*  Lol what.
Donovan mitchell is not a point guard. LeBron isn't truly a point guard either. Jrue Holiday is not a point guard. Simmons is not a point guard. Westbrook is better than Morant and Fox. So no there is not 10 better point guards.
"He has long limbs and a big frame. He is def no taller than 6'3. Just like Donovan Mitchell never looks small on the court even though he is just 6ft. Cause he has a near 7ft wingspan, big frame and weighs like 225."
&gt;but it still feels weird to think that I'd rather have him than a bona-fide star like Donovan Mitchell  Mitchell is a proven star and knowing what we know would go 1st in this draft.
Market is not the reason Donovan Mitchell isn‚Äôt considered a top 10 player. He‚Äôs just not a top 10 player.
Donovan Mitchell
"I mean specific to what you are asking, Tatum, Booker and Bam will all be 27-28 which for the vast majority of NBA players is entering/ in their prime. Beal will be 30 which is in the same ball park.  Other guys on that list who are already proven: Donovan Mitchell, Ja Morant, Trae, Jaylen Brown, Ingram, Zion and Ayton will all be somewhere in their 24-26 year old seasons which is also their prime.  This is an all time weak USA olympic team. But there are a ton of very talented 22-26 year old NBA players who will be 26-30 at the next olympics. If we bring the best of the best it could be an all time great team, but that is assuming progression from everyone listed above."
"4 years from now 12 man roster could realistically be any combination of:  PG: Cade Cunningham, Ja Morant, De‚ÄôAron Fox, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young SG: Brad Beal, Jaylen Brown, Jalen Green, Devin Booker SF: Jayson Tatum, Brandon Ingram,  PF: Bam Adebayo, Zion Williamson C: Evan Mobley, Anthony Davis, DeAndre Ayton  That is an absolutely stacked, deep talent pool. There was an unprecedented number of injuries and players sitting out this time around, but the USA talent pool is so incredibly deep."
"imo more likely that Bouk hits a Donovan Mitchell level than Kuminga hits a tier beyond that, imo the ceiling argument is the other way around unless you're counting on the .1% chance Kuminga is actually the next Giannis or whatever"
Donovan Mitchell is top 5 under 30
Donovan Mitchell at summer league going offfffffff
"Derek Rose probably won‚Äôt be absolutely forgotten, but people already overlook the times when he was an arguable too 5 player in the league, during the prime of LeBron, CP3, and Melo no less.  Dude was unbelievable. It‚Äôd be like if Donovan Mitchell took another leap from where he is now. I think I‚Äôm the future he‚Äôll be remembered as the savvy vet who can lead a bench unit and step in as a starter if needed ‚Äî the perfect backup PG (other than TJ McConnell)."
I always read Davion Mitchell as Donovan Mitchell and   have to reread post titles a lot.
"If you mean Donovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray, it‚Äôs way to early to say that."
He is 6'1 tall  with a 6'4 wingspan which is good but not elite like a Rondo who is 6'1 with a 6'9 wingspan or Donovan Mitchell who is also 6'1 with a 6'10 wingspan.
Kawhi game 7 against philly  Lebron 51 points in game 1 vs gsw  Kawhi game 6 vs Mavericks (2021)  Giannis game 6 vs Suns  Kd game 5 vs bucks  Curry going off for 12 3s vs thunder  Donovan Mitchell 51 points game 5 vs Nuggets
"[when Gobert does this, I ain't trusting passing him the ball either](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CsX4W0hzxg)  he has zero touch around the rim and can't finish through even the slightest contact. and he's not a good FT shooter either so he's very easily neutralized in crunch time. why should Donovan Mitchell work extra hard to spoon feed a liability like Gobert?"
"I love McBride, but he shouldn‚Äôt be compared to Davion. It‚Äôs funny, people used to clown me for saying Davion would be one of the best players in the draft but I got roasted for saying he‚Äôs too short to be good, but look at him now playing like Donovan Mitchell.  Point, Mitchell has more upside than McBride, that being a way better defender and a slightly better scorer. The only thing holding Mitchell is that for some reason he sucks at free throws, which I hope fixes. Last thing any person, is for him to be the next Ben Simmons. McBride definitely has the potential though"
"Even though he is labeled as a superstar, I think Donovan Mitchell. Rarely is ever talked about, and I‚Äôve seen people even say Jamal Murray ‚Äústart of the season‚Äù was better than him."
Donovan Mitchell. But I'm biased.
Donovan Mitchell
people here say he's better than Donovan Mitchell so Gobert is waaaay overrated
"Donovan Mitchell. He‚Äôs an absolute stud, especially in the playoffs, and still doesn‚Äôt get the recognition he deserves."
"Mitchell and Gobert are both locked up for five years, and most of the supporting cast for 3 years. The Jazz are probably the furthest team in the league from needing to worry about players wanting to leave.   Also Mitchell atm has no real right to ask for a trade/feel like he deserves better. We lost due to abysmal guard defense, and that‚Äôs largely Mitchell‚Äôs fault because he should be the guy on our team locking up opposing guards but he hasn‚Äôt since he was a rookie. He‚Äôs also almost completely shielded from blame because it‚Äôs always Rudy‚Äôs fault (in the public eye) no matter how we lose. Donovan also has arguably the best spacing in the league around him. He has a lot of growth to do before he can really complain about the team around him. He‚Äôs still not even our best player."
Jalen Green - Bradley Beal/Zach Lavine  Anthony Edwards - Bigger Donovan Mitchell  Cade Cunningham - Khris Middleton/SGA  Ja Morant - John Wall  Jonathon Kuminga - Raw Paul George  Tyrese Haliburton - Malcolm Brogdan

So far from these SL it looks like I‚Äôm wrong on Davion.. I thought he‚Äôs gonna be Avery Bradley with better handles and shot making.. but some of the shit he‚Äôs doing is Donovan Mitchell lite
bro what. who did prime Dwight have that's better than Donovan Mitchell?
Donovan Mitchell putting back on the Lakers his rookie year was pretty filthy and better than this AI dunk.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U2jWoRK6mg  His Game Blouses Dunk against Houston is better too.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMj1HFDPf0

"The link I posted has the stats. Since you obviously didn't bother (probably because of your Steph colored glasses.) I put what was relevant below. I'll grant this... It basically says that Steph is a below average to poor defender (by every metric) BPM, RPM and FiveThirtyEights DRAYMOND and those adjusted for DRAYMOND. Problem is, in the playoffs he faces above average to excellent guards. Those PGs and SGs hunt matchups with Steph because to them, he's an easy mark.  **From the article...**  &gt;These are some pretty interesting lists. Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There‚Äôs also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic Cases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents‚Äô shooting data than what we‚Äôve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.  &amp;#x200B;  **The Guards....**  Kemba Walker	-0.80	-0.10	+0.70  Isaiah Thomas	-2.62	-1.99	+0.63  Raymond Felton	-0.74	-0.13	+0.61  Jaylen Brown	+0.11	+0.71	+0.6  Klay Thompson	-0.91	-0.34	+0.57  Matthew Dellavedova	-1.16	-0.60	+0.56  Jrue Holiday	+0.72	+1.25	+0.54  Jeremy Lin	-0.41	+0.04	+0.45  Mike Conley	-0.38	+0.06	+0.44  Derrick Rose	-2.11	-1.68	+0.43  JJ Redick	-1.66	-1.25	+0.41  Gerald Green	-1.82	-1.44	+0.38  Eric Gordon	-1.76	-1.41	+0.35  Goran Dragic	-0.92	-0.61	+0.32  James Harden	-0.33	-0.02	+0.31  Bradley Beal	-0.95	-0.64	+0.30  CJ McCollum	-1.18	-0.89	+0.29  Mario Chalmers	+0.25	+0.53	+0.28  Jarrett Jack	-1.23	-0.98	+0.25  Aaron Gordon	+0.27	+0.52	+0.25  Devin Booker	-2.76	-2.51	+0.25  Spencer Dinwiddie	-1.30	-1.07	+0.23  Reggie Bullock	-0.91	-0.69	+0.22  Austin Rivers	-1.70	-1.49	+0.21  Dennis Schroder	-2.10	-1.91	+0.19  Lou Williams	-2.83	-2.64	+0.18  Deron Williams	-0.92	-0.74	+0.17  Tim Hardaway Jr.	-2.23	-2.07	+0.16  Jason Terry	-0.54	-0.42	+0.12  Jordan Clarkson	-2.79	-2.68	+0.11  Wesley Matthews	-0.46	-0.35	+0.11  Donovan Mitchell	+0.26	+0.34	+0.08  ***Stephen Curry	+0.33	+0.39	+0.06***  Khris Middleton	-0.17	-0.11	+0.06  Nick Young	-2.61	-2.56	+0.05  Shaun Livingston	+0.18	+0.21	+0.03  Paul George	+1.30	+1.32	+0.03  Buddy Hield	-1.61	-1.59	+0.02  Jae Crowder	+0.38	+0.39	+0.01  J.J.

So does Lillard and luka and ad and Tatum and maybe Donovan Mitchell lol
"&gt; It‚Äôs not recency bias to consider what we just saw from players over the last 6 months, and reconsider rankings accordingly  People who say these things are the ones who will say things like ‚Äúin a playoff series give me Jimmy Butler over James harden he‚Äôs proved himself as the real 16 game playoff assassin!!‚Äù and then see Butler this year get out scored by Bryn Forbes and call him a fraud. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt have a jumper you will get exposed in the playoffs!‚Äù it soon becomes   It‚Äôs all so stupid and yes a big problem is people not realizing the degree to which even 15-20 game playoff sample sizes are small samples and not predictive of much going forward. A big part of it is not realizing how sample sizes work while insisting that the sample size they are looking at is a lot smaller than they realize. One new thing I‚Äôve seen is people insist ‚Äú18 games of Donovan Mitchell shooting way above his career norm from 3 in the playoffs is a good sample‚Äù and thinking it‚Äôll be predictive of future postseason performance which nobody who works with data for a living in any capacity would consider a viable take"
"hell no was he good overall in 2018. waxed by a rookie Donovan Mitchell, randomly getting emotional about Rubio, and still losing after Rubio got hurt. he was beyond atrocious in the 3 straight games OKC lost to Utah  he outplayed KD when? against the 6th seed Mavs that nobody cared about? KD saved their ass from going down 3-1 to the Spurs and both were bad against the Warriors  \#2 doesn't mean anything when he took more shots than Lebron or KD and hogged the ball in crunch time making terrible decisions. also his stupid foul on Chalmers  Westbrook routinely plays bad in big playoff moments"
"Ja Morant brings that same prime Wade/DRose energy. Donovan Mitchell is really similar too, just a better shooter."
"Mitchell doesn't play half the defence Embiid plays....also Embiid just averaged almost 29 points a game this season...so no, offensively he's not a weaker player than Donovan Mitchell. Not to mention Donovan Mitchell can facilitate better than Embiid sure but 5 asts to almost 3 turnovers a game is a pretty bad ratio."
"The casual sports fan and people who don't really follow basketball will know the superstars.   Everyone knows who Lebron, KD, and Curry are. I would say these three are above even superstars, some sort of mega star or something.   Kawhi, AD, Harden, these guys are definite superstars. Fans and casuals alike know who they are.   Jokic, Embiid, and Luka are getting there, maybe just need some time to get more name recognition (all three of them play at a superstar level, but haven't necessarily been playing at the elite of the elite level in order to get the massive following).   Non basketball fans do not give a fuck about Donovan Mitchell lol"
"Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker are all in the same tier as players... presuming Murray rebounds from injury."
"&gt; most marketable players in the league  I think this is a huge part of it.  You need to have a good chunk of fans behind you too. Luka might not be a ""superstar"" yet, but he's marketable and people talk about him.  Probably just me but I feel more excited about Luka playing than Donovan Mitchell and that's nothing against Mitchell.  In my opinion, there's a certain degree of fame associated with being a ""superstar""."
"Great list, SG position is in a good place right now thanks to them.   No superstar here, yet. Donovan might get there. D.Book is a generational scorer who will get better and has a high ceiling. Beal has peaked on bad teams. Lavine is impressive but needs to be on a winning team being clutch and buying in defensively before he can climb above the other 3.   I feel bad for Beal because he's older and in a bad situation with the Wizards. Lavine will be the reason the Bulls fail or succeed, and I don't think he's ready to be an elite competitor that wins playoff series against good defensive squads. He can get there though but i don't think he's a good enough 2 way player/leader.   Long story short, Booker and Mitchell have the potential to alter the NBA landscape in a way you almost need a top 10 player to carry you through a playoff run. I don't think Lavine and Beal have that same potential. I could see Beal being part of a Cinderella run and winning one, but not on the Wizards, more like the missing piece if he got traded. Would be a perfect Middleton replacement on the Bucks for example. Also, huge shout-out to Jrue Holiday, definition of a winner. Not getting enough credit for being a true difference maker because defense matters more than we speak of it.   1A Mitchell 1B Booker 3 Beal (at least as good as D.Book right now, but older &amp; worse situation) 4 Lavine   Apologies for the rant and thanks for making it this far."
I'm taking Donovan Mitchell first for sure just because he has been incredible in the Playoffs:  [2021 Playoffs Donovan Mitchell averaged 32/6/4](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/donovan-mitchell-playoff-stats-2021) including 12 3p attempts/game at 45%.   [2020 he averaged 36/5/5](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/donovan-mitchell-2020-nba-playoffs-stats) on 53/52/95 shooting
"Donovan Mitchell is not a superstar. The term ‚ÄúSuperstar‚Äù should be reserved for only the most elite, most marketable players in the league. Guys that are MVP level"
"I think it's popular because it's about Kyrie.  But in general, I don't think the history of shoot-first, bad playmaking PGs leading teams is non-existent?   Gilbert Arenas and Steve Francis come to mind, they're better than people remember but their teams never did anything.  I don't know if it's a coincidence or why it might be, because there have been plenty of successful teams lead by high-usage SGs (AI, Wade in 2006, Donovan Mitchell).  Something about just having a floor general out there matters I guess, even if they don't control every possession."
"Going to start off with possibly the most unpopular basketball-related opinion in existence: Bill Laimbeer was hot in the 80s.    I like Joe Ingles but a lot of his autism awareness is advocating for organisations and programs that actively harm actually autistic people.  Donovan Mitchell and his fans being so salty over Simmons being in contention for Rookie of the Year because he was drafted in 2016 was just dumb - otherwise Larry Bird shouldn‚Äôt have won ROY over Magic.   Unless they play at an absolutely undeniably elite level, the Ball brothers‚Äô legacy will be tainted by how embarrassing their dad is.  It‚Äôs like that one dad who insists his kids are better than everyone graduated from their kids being in the juniors to in the pros, and it‚Äôs just awkward to watch.  Until he actually proves himself outside of summer league, LiAngelo being on the Hornets will always look like nepotism.   Matisse Thybulle‚Äôs dad is much more fun to watch than Lavar Ball.  Ben Simmons also gets way too much credit for Matisse playing for Aus.   Kareem is the üêê   üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è&gt; ü¶Ö"
Russel westbrook hasn‚Äôt won a playoff series without harden or KD. He‚Äôs only one one playoff series since in total. This includes losing to rookie year Donovan Mitchell.
"Not sure how unpopular some of these are, but I'll throw some out:  - **LeBron is the GOAT and the distance between him and MJ isn't as close as some think.**  Not a long argument for me. LeBron's all-around game is better, and he's doing better over a longer period of time, often with far less talent around him and during the basketball renaissance across the globe that's happened over the past ~15 yrs. that has made the level of competition greater than it's ever been.  Take a look at some of those Cavs teams that LeBron drug to the Finals. I think the Cavs' Finals win over the Warriors is more impressive than any of the Bulls' titles.  While I'm here, I think the distance between Kareem and MJ is closer than MJ and LeBron.  - **If not for Dirk, the Mavs would consistently be considered one of the worst run franchises in the NBA.**  The more that comes out about the culture behind the scenes the more it kind of makes sense why they could never land a big free agent, even DeAndre Jordan.  Subsequently, I think many consider Dirk one of the best to ever play, but I think - due to his ability to carry this team to so much winning despite the people running the team from Cuban on down, I think we may actually be underrating Dirk's greatness nowadays, despite how great we already think he is.  Their title v. the Heat looks even more impressive and makes me think higher of Carlisle too.  Suns will do fine with Ayton, and ATL is doing fine with Trae, so if it wasn't for the Kings being the Kings and not taking Luka, the Mavs would currently be recognized right now as one of the NBA's top clusterfucks of a franchise.  - **It may be time to for the Spurs to force Pop out in a polite way.**  First, let me say, I think Pop can still coach. I think the Olympics proved that. But I also think that's the better type of team for him to be coaching at this point in his career, an all-star level team or a team with several stars.  Obviously, all of us know what he's meant to the Spurs franchise, but Budz is gone, Ime is gone, and they may lose out on Becky if they don't set a plan in place. (Which, there doesn't seem to be one if she's still interviewing heavy for other jobs.)  At some point, especially for a franchise like the Spurs who may keep the coach a long-time, you need to be thinking about the future, and as someone who likes Ime and Becky (and thinks Budz and Brown may be a bit underrated), there just seems to be a lot of brain drain from the coaching staff in favor of keeping the oldest coach in the NBA.  - **The Jazz are one of the most overrated franchises in the NBA.**  Congrats on the Top 4 seeds, and consistency. Yes, consistently not mattering when it matters most. I think a lot of people in the media like that the Jazz make competent moves (they don't often hit big, but also don't often fail big), and the idea of what the Jazz could be, rather than what they are - consistently forgettable. Play the game the right way and all that.  Donovan Mitchell will realize this too and get tired of being consistently solid when he leaves in a couple of years."
SGA is already better than Donovan Mitchell
"Donovan Mitchell is not a legit number one option and even though his numbers say he‚Äôs efficient the eye test doesn‚Äôt back it up. He takes far too long to set up his defender and make his move. Plays hero ball all too often and takes way too many bad looks down the stretch. I‚Äôd rather have Lavine, Booker, or Trae Young.   The Jazz have had one of the best supporting casts in all of basketball and if you can‚Äôt even make it out of the 2nd round in the playoffs as a number one option there‚Äôs something wrong there."
Also mike Conley being injured played into the standard Donovan Mitchell hero ball mentality that has cost them in every playoffs
"I agree Gobert could be better individually against a switching defense. But I also think even at his current skill level the team could do a better job of supporting him and getting him the ball in positions where he can score even with his limited skill set. I'm not sure he's ever played with someone who's actually good at throwing lobs. This might just be a homer opinion because he's my favorite player though.  Another big problem the Jazz had against the Clippers was that the Clippers guards were getting past the non-Gobert defenders with ease on pretty much every play. If the other Jazz defenders did a better job staying in front of their man Gobert wouldn't have to leave a shooter to prevent an uncontested layup so often. I would like to give Donovan Mitchell a pass on this since he was clearly limited by his ankle injury but he's not very good on defense when he's uninjured either. Bogdanovic was another major culprit. He had some surprisingly good defensive possessions against Kawhi at the beginning of the series, but in the games the Jazz were losing he made Marcus Morris look like prime Carmelo Anthony on face-up jabstep midrange jumpers. I don't know if the data is publicly available to tell for sure but I swear Morris shot like 80% when guarded by Bogdanovic."
"Middleton and Adebayo are great players, but they are way too high on this list. Why are they ahead of Trae Young, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, and Donovan Mitchell?"
Donovan Mitchell will never live up to the hype of being a superstar.  Lamelo Ball is going to bring a championship to Charlotte in a few years.
Jazz are stupid trying to mortgage their future assets to please donovan Mitchell when it‚Äôs pretty clear he dislikes Utah for the people/political beliefs and he will force his way to New York within the next 3 years
all time russell westbrook but right now donovan mitchell. westbrook is an nba legend!!
Reminds me of Rudy/Donovan Mitchell relationship being irreparable...
"Perhaps you missed this part: ""the *57 players* in the USA basketball pool (not just the final roster) were subject to drug testing:""  [Here's the full list.](https://www.usab.com/news-events/news/2021/03/m-oly-finalists.aspx) In addition to the final Olympics roster, it includes players like LeBron, AD, CP3, Steph, Dame, Kyrie, Harden, Kawhi, Paul George, Westbrook, Butler, Lowry, etc. That's pretty much a who's who of prominent American players in the latter half of their careers.  Also, you've got the next generation of superstars in Trae Young, Tatum, Zion, Donovan Mitchell; then there's the class of guys who used to be elite and might be especially tempted to juice to battle the effects of injury or general decline: Kemba, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, K-Love, John Wall, Mike Conley, Gordon Hayward, and Dwight Howard. That's a whole lot of guys signing up for DUI checkpoints."

"Not a good playmaker. Dude you dumb as rocks, DLo is not only a good playmaker, he's a great (but not elite) playmaker. He's a comparable or better playmaker than Ja Morant, Damian Lillard, De'Aaron Fox, Jrue Holiday, Donovan Mitchell, and Brandon Ingram. Some of these guys benefit from having a more aggressive scoring game and being the clear focal point of their team (Dame, Ja, Fox), and some of these guys numbers are depressed because of the team and system within which they play (according to my eye: Donovan Mitchell for sure, maybe BI)."
Donovan Mitchell

"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
"It was totally fine in the playoffs. He never got abused by other teams like people thought he would and even made some good plays when he was being posted up by big men including Giannis. Trae had a playoff defensive rating of 111.7 which is very much average.  Better defensive rating than... RJ Barret, KCP, Paul George, Kawhi, Rondo, RoCo, Jimmy Butler, Donovan Mitchell, and Marcus Smart. All of which have significantly higher defensive reputations."
"I mean I grew up a Raps fan so I'll always be one to an extent, but I also want to watch basketball I will enjoy. If they suddenly became boring (not saying they are now) to watch then I would definitely just tune in more to players I'd rather watch. Huge Donovan Mitchell fan for example so I watched a fair bit of Jazz games last year even though I haven't historically liked the Jazz."
"Idk man, there's not many times they passed on some player they should have known would be amazing, usually the next few picks are too impressive either. The only big miss you could say is donovan mitchell but like half the league passed on him."
He looks like Donovan Mitchell in the way he moves and finishes at the rim
"We‚Äôre comparing hall of famers so what I said was a little hyperbolic, but cp3 has dealt with many injuries/unfortunate circumstances as well. And the stat pad thing is like I said whatever you want to believe. Getting out of the first round as the best player on your team is a low standard if your comparing him to cp3, you just can‚Äôt loose to a rookie Donovan Mitchell if you‚Äôre on that level it just can‚Äôt happen. It‚Äôs doubly crazy because he had Paul George two of those years, and Paul George just put a BETTER version of the Utah jazz away WITHOUT Kawhi those last few games."
Donovan Mitchell is a fucking Karen and all the soft ass player worshippers just wanna suck him off and go along with whatever they say
"Holy shit Donovan Mitchell is a fucking Karen, I honestly wonder what he would do if he went and watched a European or football (soccer) game, he'd be in a state of shock at the shit they say   Donovan ""Karen"" Mitchell"
donovan mitchell
The question is if he can ever be in the same room as Donovan Mitchell again.
Oh it was available when I commented.  It basically said ‚Äúthis doesn‚Äôt make your son a savage‚Äù.  [Donovan Mitchell also responded saying ‚ÄúThis is lame asf encouraging your son to do this‚Äù](https://twitter.com/spidadmitchell/status/1425182812840374273?s=21)
"There are plenty of examples of players getting drafted to good teams and still playing 30+ minutes their rookie years. You cited Tatum, but the Celtics went to the ECF the year he was drafted. Donovan Mitchell was drafted to a Jazz team that just lost Gordon Hayward and basically slotted right into his role as primary scorer. If the Sixers thought Maxey was good enough to start, he'd be starting."
"Kyrie, Donovan Mitchell, Ja Morant, Anthony Edwards, and Jalen Suggs would be fun to watch. All Athletic, Strong, and Dynamic!"
"They‚Äôve already done a good job with the supermax deals, look at Donovan Mitchell in Utah"

"The other adjustment Melo needs to make is to convert more of his long midgrange shots into 3PA.   He started this process last year, but he still took more than 40% of his shots from midrange (10 ft+). That meant he was still an inefficient scorer despite shooting 41% on threes.

"Ready to get downvoted, but I'd take him over Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, and maybe Westbrook."
"Anthony Edwards, Giannis, Jokic, Luka(if he stops whining to the refs), Donovan Mitchell all deserve more pushing from the NBA imo   Ant for sure though, too bad he won't because Minnesota"
I love Donovan Mitchell but from what I have seen of him he isn't nearly as hilarious. Still a great dude though from what I can tell.
"hes up there with donovan mitchell, people would agree if don played in a big market and the way he carries himself had visibility"
Future celtic Donovan Mitchell
"For now I think Deron is higher because he played longer. And was in discussion for best PG in the league between '08-'10.  But in about 3 years, I predict its Donovan Mitchell."
"If you ask the first take crew Donovan Mitchell is already number oneüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ, but I think a case can be made for Donovan Mitchell being third along with Rudy gobert when you look at the defense accolades, shout out to Deron Williams as well, even though he seemed to fall off a cliff out of nowhere"
Draft Donovan Mitchell instead of Frank Ntlikina
"In terms of in-game dunkers, I'm always fond of guys who aren't afraid to push the boundaries, put on a show, and hurt the rim. There's a lot of athletic freaks out there who just don't seem motivated to do anything special (tough to fault from a game perspective) but among the dudes I think are doing it right at the moment:   [Ja Morant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeBRMSwc8VY&amp;ab_channel=MemphisGrizzlies): He could be a super athletic basic dunker if he wanted but his willingness to do things like [add a two-hand windmill to a mid-game lob toss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrSq-z8TRyk&amp;ab_channel=HouseofHighlights) is what makes him a special dunker to me.   [Miles Bridges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clPeyxb8SVs&amp;ab_channel=NBA): Would make Kenyon Martin Sr. proud, and probably a bit jealous.   [Donovan Mitchell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gt6-GUJ0hJ4&amp;ab_channel=NBArtv): Some of the best tomahawks in the league.   [Derrick Jones Jr.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E72NkHc-gSU&amp;ab_channel=SPProductions): Lost track of him this year and I didn't watch the full highlight clip but based on what I saw from him in Miami, I imagine he's still mostly worthy (I know there was an injury or two in there that may have had an effect).   [John Collins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_H3hnqd9_E&amp;ab_channel=RookieProductions): Might be my favorite big man dunker at the moment."
Rookie Donovan Mitchell was one of the most entertaining rookies ever.   That duel he had against Russ in game 6 was some all time shit
"I would like to see them succeed, but if I was a gm I wouldnt take all over donovan Mitchell."
"In my younger days, I copied my game after Isiah Thomas.  These days I love to watch Donovan Mitchell, Jamaal Murray and Ja Morant."
"I agree but it's also not like he needs a KD next to him. Mitchell is good but certainly not insanely hard to pair similar talent next to him. I don't think it's unreasonable to say you need a player or two of Donovan Mitchell's talent in order to compete for a championship, you know? In fact, I'd say he's about the lowest reasonable bar to doing so."
"This seems like a big deal. Watching youtube highlights he came across closer to a Donovan Mitchell type, but hearing that he was 6'8 pushed into a Paul George type which IMO really helped his stock."
Difference is Gobert is a 5 who can anchor a defence. Simmons isn't. He's a good defender but his talents lie in his versatility and not the ability to buoy the defence of an entire team. You also have Donovan Mitchell as part of that equation and players like that don't grow on trees.
I didn't compare Jalen Green to Mitchell. I said someone ELSE may surprise us and pull a Donovan Mitchell. Read the comment properly bud
I think there's gonna be a sleeper in the ROY race. Someone's gonna pull a Donovan Mitchell and surprise everyone cause this class is stacked
Definitely. Because once Donovan Mitchell left the bubble he went from averaging 36.3 PPG against Denver to just 34.8 PPG against the Clippers
I wouldn‚Äôt say nothing matters. Obviously good play can also foreshadow what‚Äôs coming in the regular season but it also might not. Donovan Mitchell and Kevin knox are good examples.
"Donovan Mitchell, he wasn‚Äôt even a top ten pick and the jazz have just lost Hayward."
No. My example is Donovan Mitchell. He‚Äôs great but I wouldn‚Äôt call him a generational talent
donovan mitchell is definitely not the same height.
He's only 160 lbs too   Donovan Mitchell is the same height and almost outweighs him by 50 lbs
Yup even on offense there are a lot of long guards who play bigger than their size because they just have a better ability to finish around defense. Donovan Mitchell comes to mind
"Yeah they have, but he‚Äôs only ever gone up against the clippers. Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell also has great numbers against the clippers. Part of it is Lukas greatness but also part of it is the clippers do no defend guards that well in the postseason."
Perpetual Rookie of the Year.  Donovan Mitchell still in shambles.
"No, but I'm inferring since Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell had it that night. High probability that in an arena of 20K fans, maskless, it was spread easily."
"yo how does he get up so quick fuck  dudes like donovan mitchell can explode and jump high, but i dont think anyone is close to this kind of explosiveness"
"All the Utah Jazz players (current gen) get a lot of unnecessary crap. Karl Malone and John Stockton -- yeah, fuck them. But Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell don't deserve the hatred they get. They seem like good guys."
"Injuries destroyed his development and opportunities to play. He was raw but showed flashes in 82 games as a rookie. Tore his ACL with Australia the summer after his rookie year and missed his whole sophomore year. Up and down 3rd year after rehabbing the knee injury. TJ Warren jumped on his shoulder in 2017 preseason causing him to have surgery and miss the first 68 games of his 4th season (and derailing the summer-long hype for a DMX bench backcourt with Donovan Mitchell). Showed flashes in the playoffs (especially defensively against Harden) and signed a 2nd contract with the Jazz. Up and down start to his 5th year with inconsistent minutes and play, finally had a run of solid games immediately followed by an ankle sprain and bone bruise that caused him to miss 25 games, tore his patellar tendon 4 games into his return and missed the rest of the season and the start of his 6th season, then traded to Cleveland where a sprained ankle ended his season. This season he played 6 games for the Cavs before suffering a calf injury, being traded to Houston, and missing the rest of the season.  He's either suffered a major injury or been rehabbing a major injury in nearly every offseason of his career and has played 0, 66, 14, 42, 35, and 6 games in the 6 regular seasons since playing 82 as a rookie."

LaMelo Ball  Also Kyrie Irving if he actually wanted to play basketball  There is probably some you could make arguments for one way or the other and obviously fit comes into play so I doubt they're trying to trade for say Rudy Gobert, but I also probably forgot some players you could add to this list as well.  That being said you're also probably not getting a 1 for 1 trade for Simmons with the current situation. So I guess you hold out and hope the situation improves"
I'm thinking Donovan Mitchell at this rate
"They've done well, but those were some high picks also. Its a lot easier to draft well when you pick at #2 every year.  * Randle at 7 was a good pick, but not the best pick in that draft or anything. Still, I'd say he'd go higher in a redraft so props to them for the pick. * Rusell went #2 in 2015. People have a wide range of opinions, I tend to think he's overrated. Not a bust or anything, but you figure they'd pick up Booker in a redraft, and probably also take Porzingis and Myles Turner ahead of him. The Lakers got Larry Nance late in this draft, which I do think is actually a really good pick. I'd rather have him than Russell, honestly. * Ingram #2 in 2016. Another good, not great pick. Went before Siakam, Jaylen Brown, Sabonis, Jamal Murray, Brogdon and Dejounte Murray. Not sure how a redraft would go, but probably he isn't the 2nd best player in the draft. * Lonzo went #2 in 2017 right ahead of Tatum. Bam and Donovan Mitchell also went in the lottery that year. I think he goes behind those guys for sure in a redraft, and also maybe Fox, Jarret Allan, OG, and John Collins. Not a bust, but probably not like a great pick either.  Overall I'd say good but not great picks. They didn't get any real busts, so I give them credit, but they also picked super high 3 years in a row. They could have a team with Randle, Booker, Turner, Siakam, and Donovan Mitchell or something and win 70 games."
"agreed, in a vacuum and in terms of player value i think he‚Äôs worth a lot more than that, but the Jazz FO knows that having Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, and Ben Simmons as your 3 max players is not a championship caliber team"
"Luka Doncic, Jayson Tatum, Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook, and Bradley Beal have all shot worse this year  Donovan Mitchell and SGA have shot roughly the same  Paul George, Anthony Davis, and Trae Young have barely been more efficient.   Again, lol"
"AD was better during the bubble, but Giannis was better than AD for the 2 previous years. Even then Giannis never got to finish the Heat series. He was down 0-3, but the game he got injured in he was 8 for 10 with 19 points scored in 11 minutes. No guarantee that the Heat close out a 3-1 lead. The bubble had inflated shooting numbers overall. Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell were trading 50 point games in the Jazz/Nuggets series. AD's career achievement without LeBron up to that point was 1 playoff win against Portland."
"Kevin Durant  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Joel Embiid  Kawhi Leonard  LeBron James  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Donovan Mitchell  Jayson Tatum  Trae Young  Devin Booker  Zion Williamson  Chris Paul  Rudy Gobert  Kyrie Irving  Jimmy Butler  Bradley Beal  Paul George  Jrue Holiday  Khris Middleton  Julius Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Klay Thompson  DeAndre Ayton  Ja Morant  Karl-Anthony Towns  Domantas Sabonis  Zach LaVine  Brandon Ingram  Tobias Harris  Nikola Vucevic  CJ McCollum  Jamal Murray  Kyle Lowry  Draymond Green  Pascal Siakam  Evan Mobley  Darius Garland  Pretty sure that's over 40 players, but injuries aside, I'd take all of them before Simmons in a playoff series. People don't realize just how talented the league is right now. 40 sounds like a lot but when you list 'em out? It seems about right."

I'm just saying he took more shots than Donovan Mitchell
"You're just too biased to see the truth, it's okay. Ask people in here who has been the better player overall last 2 years, AD or Jokic and see what they'll say. Your homerism won't change that.  5 or 10 playoff games won't change the fact Jokic has been the better player for some time now. And it's funny that you wanna compare players based on a single series. I guess Donovan Mitchell is better than AD, yeah? Or maybe even LeBron. Based on... 5 or 10 games, he might be the fucking GOAT. Now how fucking stupid would it be if I actually claimed he's better than them based on 10 games?  Look at what AD is doing right now on the Lakers with LeBron out. Then look at Jokic. See the difference? There's no comparison between these two players, they're not even in the same tier. AD is barely top 10, Jokic is the actual MVP and a top 4 player in the league."
"I wonder what kind of hissy fit Donovan Mitchell will have against us tonight. He usually gets t'd up for shoving Embiid or kicks over a chair and tells the media that he won the game he just lost.    That being said, I like watching him and hope he scores 40 tonight."
"How many teams get to the playoffs vs win . It ofc matters the situation but with player movement, a guy like AD is clearly more valuable then a mediocre n1 , say Donovan Mitchell ( I like Donovan I‚Äôm just trying to make a point). A great ceiling raiser seems way more valuable to winning rings , as it‚Äôs rarer too. It may look worse on his own , but once again player movement I think we see value . Kd and Steph and everyone on those warriors fit together to raise ceilings together, but individually I don‚Äôt think those guys are the best floor raisers. This sub shuts on Westbrook, I rightfully think ceiling raiser is bigger , championship teams will want you more."
Bball Paul 12 blocks on Gobert and the Sixers lose by 12 incoming. Donovan MItchell for ROY!
"I mean even the most simplistic and rudimentary test of that would be to see if they contribute to wins more offensively or defensively in the playoffs. Giannis: 2 OWS 1.7 DWS. Embiid: .7 OWS .8 DWS, and that DWS is oddly inflated considering Capela and Collins averaged 22 on 56% combined in the paint alone.  What about some of the greatest defensive players of all time?   Tim Duncan: 20.5 OWS 17.4 DWS.  Hakeem: 11.9 OWS 10.7 DWS.  Micheal Jordan: OWS: 27.3 DWS: 12.4  Kawhi Leonard: OWS: 14.6 DWS 7.9.  What about the playoffs last year in general, if all things are equal you'd expect the win shares per 48 minutes to be evenly split among offensive and defensive guys, and if defense is where the value is really at then would you not expect them to fly to the top of the list?  1. Damian ""No Defense"" Lillard: .286 ws/48 2. Kawhi ""4x the OWS as my DWS"" Leonard:¬†.277 ws/48¬†3. James ""Cmon Now"" Harden: .263 ws/48  In fact I implore you to see what kind of player leads every regular season, or every playoffs, in win shares. It is either a guy who is just incredible offensively all year/all playoffs (because offense is, though you contest it, vastly more valuable and unique than defense) or it's a two-way player like the HOFers above that does both things but the OWS are always greater because again, offense is straight up a greater contributor to winning than defense past a certain threshold.¬†  I mean damn how come the league's best defense (Utah) with the best singularly defensive player by far (Gobert) lose every damn year, and yet we see something like the Nets vs. Bucks last year which saw KD almost pull out an incredible upset not off his defensive prowess, but because he could not be stopped from scoring; and how did that series end? With Giannis (40) dueling KD (48) and just barely getting the win.  And the finals, how did they end? With Giannis dropping 50 points on 75% TS for an OBPM of 13.6 and a DBPM of 5 while/because the rest of his team couldn't score at all.  &gt;¬†Like the Bucks had a top 5 postseason defence ever and Embiid reduces opponents scoring by 10pts per hundred when he checks in, in the postseason.  Imagine what that top 5 postseason defense would have looked like if Giannis weren't an elite scorer who was, by every metric, more valuable as a scorer than a defender.¬†  Jrue was the best defender in that series, the on/off numbers for the Bucks are worse when Jrue is off compared to Giannis, but he couldn't score worth a damn which ended up seeing many less ws, less bpm, everything.¬†  As far as Embiid reducing scoring by 100pts¬†per hundred when he checks in,¬†that may very well be true and yet, by every metric, it's the Philly offense which struggles the most and is most improved by Joel Embiid being on/off the court.   As a team (and this isn't a perfect measure because of how benches play vs starters, but it is important to note) Philly had a 118 ORTG and 106 DRTG when Joel was on the court. When he's off the court they have a 106 ORTG and a 106 DRTG. That basically equates to the bench being able to play even with the other team when he's out with whoever is out there for both teams, but when he goes in vs. whoever is out there Philly outscores their opponent by a boat load. By far the biggest swing on the team.¬†  &gt;¬†Defence &gt;&gt; Scoring. High level playmaking may be the most valuable skill but tell me when someone scores 25 with fewer than 3.5 assists a game (without an elite playmaking teammate) leads a team to a top seed. And I'll stand here and point at Gobert who has been doing just that for like the last 6 seasons.  I'm sorry but this has just never been the case. It has never, ever, ever, been the case. The famous phrase ""great offense beats great defense"" is a cliche and staple for a reason. Because it's true.¬†  I don't know what your point is here with the¬†whole 3.5 assists thing, which seems really arbitrary because if someone has the ball in their hand to score 25 a game they will find 4 assists a night whether they were looking to or not.   For instance Kawhi and Paul George are both not great passers, they averaged 5 assists each last year by virtue of the ball really only being in their hands to make decisions with, They were 4th in the west and would have finished higher if not for injuries.  What about, I dunno, the 01 Lakers? That was a good team.¬†Kobe averaged a team high 5 assists, but it's not like he was looking to pass and most of that was a dump in to Shaq. He scored 28 a game. They went 16-1 in the playoffs.  What about the 2012 OKC Thunder? Durant had 3.5 assists. Harden had 3.5 assists. Russ had 5.5 but he turned it over 3.6 times a game which is a horrendous AST/TO ratio and indicative of someone who is absolutely not an elite playmaker. They went to the Finals.  How about the championship Rockets? Vernon Maxwell and Kenny had 4 and 5 assists a game but that was from dumping it into Hakeem over and over again. Nobody would call them elite or even very good passers/playmakers. They won back to back championships.  I can find a billion examples like this through NBA history, so I suppose I have now told you that and if you need 10 more teams who were a top 3 seed in NBA history with no elite playmaking teammates I'll be glad to find them for you.¬†  &gt;¬†And I'll stand here and point at Gobert who has been doing just that for like the last 6 seasons.  Doing what? Leading Utah to a top seed? Well first and foremost you break your own rule here¬†because Donovan Mitchell averaged 26 and 5 assists, and Conley is in there with 16 and 6 as well so there's that.  Secondly, how's that been working out for Utah? They keep losing series because Conley gets banged up and Donovan Mitchell ends up being a wildly inefficient¬†scorer and they can't keep up with better offensive teams. The Denver Nuggets came back on them 3-1 through offense alone.¬†  3 of the Nuggets wins were them just hanging 117 points a game on them, and then there was the last game which was just everyone being nervous and shitting themselves and the Nuggets pulling it out. Ultimately because Jokic was the only player on either team who scored over 22 points or shot over 50% from the floor.  I haven't even pointed out that a purely defensive player (outside of Gobert and Utah had no other option anyway) has never gotten paid like a purely defensive player at the top level of those. Teams pay people to win them games. Teams know that guys who can have elite offensive production night in and night out are by far the most valuable players in the NBA.¬†  I mean damn dude your own team has Steph Curry, by far the most valuable piece of that franchise by galactic proportions, and for his entire career he has been a poor on ball defender and a solid team defender--this season he's been good overall though.¬†  Look at Houston. They continued to get top seed after top seed with James Harden at the helm who was putting up 35ppg, throwing passes to the corner, and playing 0 defense.¬†  The Nuggets up until this year have continued to get top seeds because Nikola Jokic might be the best offensive player in the league. Who are the other two highest paid/impactful players on that team last year? Jamal Murray who is an average defender at best but puts up 20 ppg, and Michael Porter Jr. who is now a maxed player and remains one of the worst defenders in the league but put up the 2nd highest efficiency season of all time for people scoring over 17ppg.  The fact of the matter is finding elite offensive production is just vastly more difficult than finding elite defensive production, not only because a huge portion of defense is just will and hustle to do it, but it's also extremely schematic. Now more than ever.¬†  If you don't want to believe me I suggest you read this 2014 mega deep dive about if offense or defense is more impactful for winning a championship. The conclusion there is that neither is particularly more important than the other (though elite offensive player is the most important of all players), and now in 2021 offense is more important than it was in 2014 by quite a bit and that gap has widened.¬†  [Does Defense Really Win Championships In The NBA?](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2265297-does-defense-really-win-championships-in-the-nba)"
"&gt; In impact entries that take on and off court splits in addition to box scores stats into account he was top 5 in the the postseason from 2015-19.  Can you share any non-cumulative ones of these so we can look over them to see if that's measuring how valuable Draymond is as a singular player, compared to his value compared to the player replacing him in the Warriors scheme?   &gt; ""aNd NevEr HaS bEeN"" it was literally the most valuable skill in the league for 30 years. You know one player won 11 rings off the back off of his defence.  Which 30 years were those? Because defense was, uh, not particularly existent in the 50s and 60s. Even when you're speaking of Bill Russell and those Celtics teams, they were constantly at the top of the league in PPG and played at the highest pace in the 60s. The only reason why they didn't have the #1 ORTG every season was because of that insane pace leading to, well, more questionable shots than usual. Even by those standards.  You could make the argument that it was their defense that allowed them to have such a high scoring offense I suppose but that's pretty cyclical. I mean look at the 63 East Finals against a lousy defensive team in the Royals.   Game 1: **Royals 135** Celtics 132  Game 2: **Celtics 125** Royals 102  Game 3:** Royals 121** Celtics 116 Game 4:** Celtics 128** Royals 110  Game 5: **Celtics 125** Royals 120  Game 6: **Royals 109** Celtics 99  Game 7: **Celtics 142** Royals: 131   Or what about the 66 Finals vs. the Lakers?   Game 1:** Lakers 133** Celtics 129  Game 2: **Celtics 129** Lakers 109  Game 3: **Celtics 120** Lakers 106  Game 4: **Celtics 122** Lakers 117  Game 5: **Lakers 121** Celtics 117  Game 6: **Lakers 123** Celtics 115  Game 7: **Celtics 95** Lakers 93  Russell, Havlicek, and Sam averaged 23 a piece, West and Baylor averaged 34 and 25 respectively. I implore you to go watch some tape from the 50s and 60s and try to come away with the opinion that defense was the premier skill and reason for winning back then. Hell I'd say stamina was more of a factor for winning then than defense, considering it was just a track meet up and down the court every game.  &gt; Draymond performed like a low level MVP candidate in his prime  He has only had votes casted for him one time in his entire career. That was the 15-16 record season setting where he came in 7th and his teammate, Steph Curry, was the unanimous MVP. Because Mike Fratello and John Denton had him aas their #2 MVP. Denton who had Avery Bradley as his #2 in DPOY voting, case the sole 6th man vote for...Allen Crabbe... Fratello who had LMA and Pau Gasol on his All-NBA 1st team. Cmon now. Even Draymond said in an interview he couldn't believe he got those two votes.  You are conflating the value that Draymond receives from being on some of the greatest teams of all time compared to his actual standalone value. No doubt he is a big part of those teams, but to suggest his standalone value as a player is anywhere near the quality of an MVP is past even the most fervent of fandom takes. I like Draymond as a player, a lot. He does truly unique things. If you put him on any other team besides the Warriors his value drops off a cliff. If you put any other ""MVP"" players on a different team, ever, their value does not change much.   You would have to suggest that Draymond is account for 20+ points negated on defense alone to have the same standalone impact as an MVP caliber player, which would be by far the most of all time by lightyears.  By every single defensive metric you're going to find, Rudy Gobert is a more impactful defender than Draymond Green. In fact Gobert has a number of the best defensive seasons of all time. Rudy had the highest DRAPTOR rating of all time last year at +8 going back to 77. The highest DRPM since 1996. #1 and #3 DEPM seasons since 04. DLEBRON says he has the #1 and #4 best defensive seasons of all time. He has the single season record for most team points allowed since 06-07.   This was all last season.  So by every ""impact"" and ""performance"" metric there is, the solid ones or as solid as you can be since defensive metrics are kinda meh, Gobert is a vastly superior defender than Draymond, and last season might have been the best defensive season of all time. Did you feel like he was an MVP candidate? Was he even a low-level candidate? Probably not something you had ever considered and you might not consider it right now either.   &gt; AD is no doubt a better scorer but most most of his championship equity outside of that single bubble run (because he was shooting like 40% on 3s and 60% on midrange Js) comes as a defender as he isn't effective as a scorer in isolation or a playmaker, (which isn't the case with Draymond as he is an excellent passer).  First of all let's not undersell that first point.   Draymond's best scoring season was on the 73 win warriors where he scored 14 points a game on 49/39/68. Excluding this season he would never average over 45% from the floor again or over 30% from 3 again. Nor did he before that. No doubt Draymond is a better passer, that's part of his role in that offense because he cannot score at an NBA level. He averages 5 more assists a game than AD for his career.  AD is not used as a passer even if he is better than we think because he is an elite scorer. He is the guy people like Draymond pass the ball to. He is on a streak of 9 straight 20+ ppg seasons. 7 of which are over 24 points. 4 of which are over 26. 2 of which are over 28. Obviously on much better efficiency than Draymond from every shooting location that is tracked. He's not just a better scorer. Most years he double or triples Draymond's scoring.   Even considering Draymond's elite positional passing and being on historic offenses he only cracks the top 20 of OWS once. That 15-16 outlier season for him where he was 10th. AD is top 20 6 times, and top 5 4 times.   Draymond has never been top 20 in OBPM. Anthony Davis has not only been top 20 6 times but he is 14th overall in NBA history by that measure.  The levels of value on offense that AD is greater than Draymond, even when Draymond sits on these historic offensive teams that are the absolute perfect positions for him imaginable in all of NBA history, are staggering. They cannot even be mentioned in the same breath. Draymond is like if you fused a non-rebounding Dennis Rodman with a non-scoring Andre Miller. AD is one of the greatest scorers in NBA history.   &gt; most of his championship equity outside of that single bubble run (because he was shooting like 40% on 3s and 60% on midrange Js) comes as a defender as he isn't effective as a scorer in isolation or a playmaker, (which isn't the case with Draymond as he is an excellent passer).  First of all let me make it clear. I don't care about championships in this discussion, nor do I think it's particularly relevant when assessing the individual talent of players. Especially in this case however, because there is no case that Draymond is a #1, 2, or 3 offensive option on his team--so there isn't a discussion to be had like Jokic vs. AD wherein you can suggest Jokic is that extra level better because he's a true all game #1 option that leads to winning.   As Gilbert Arenas said in regards to the 75th Anni List redo he did, ""Championships are the cherry on top of the sundae, stats, all-nbas, all-stars, individual achievements are the sundae. Championships are just this extra thing on top of that to be a tie breaker or a nudge over the edge.""   So while AD did go crazy in the bubble, and conspiratorial as it may be I think that he and the Lakers got some serious help from the refs, it's not like it was some outlier among outliers like Draymond 15-16 season. Certainly his bubble run (28/10/3.5/1/1.5 on 57/38[3 attempts]/73) was better than his other playoff seasons (31/11/2/1/3 on 54/00/89 and 31/13/2/2/2 on 52/27[2 attempts]/83) shows he is still an elite playoff performer. In fact when you account for the fact he was on wildly worse teams than that LA team in 15 and 18 where teams could double and swarm him all game, compared to a Lakers team with LeBron and shooters, and the fact that most shooters got hot in that bubble, it's even less of a staggering outlier.  As far as being effective as a scorer in isolation in 19-20 AD was in the 71st percentile for isolation scorers. Not elite but certainly not ineffective. That was better than players like Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, and around the same as Jason Tatum and CP3.   As you can imagine Draymond is in the no-percentile on that because they would never isolate Draymond. Additionally playmaking is more than assists, which Draymond is an elite passer especially for his position but he is not a good playmaker.   Playmaking is not passing, that's just one component of it. Playmaking comes from being a threat to get places on the court to score or pass.  The more of those places and the more ways you can do that, the better a playmaker you are. The play part of playmaking is there for a reason, and there are many more plays than a pass. Otherwise we'd call it a passmaker. Draymond isn't a threat to score, he isn't a threat for the defense to collapse in on, his passing comes from passing to people off screens or when the defense makes a mistake because his IQ is great. It also comes from his elite 2 man game with Curry, the best shooter of all time who is going to convert a lot of those assists. But a playmaker he is not.   &gt; Its the same with Giannis and Embiid as well. Their scoring is brilliant but their value in the postseason comes from their standout defence.  No. It comes from both. I don't even really understand how you can come to the conclusion that their value in the postseason comes from their standout defense more than their scoring, let alone the sole value.

"Well he's definitely better than guys that didn't show up on OP's list like Devin Booker, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, LaMelo Ball, Lonzo Ball, Bradley Beal, SGA, Tyler Herro, Kyle Lowry, Anthony Edwards, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Cole Anthony, Fred VanVleet, Dejounte Murray, Darius Garland, Dennis Schroder, Tyrese Maxey, Spencer Dinwiddie, Ricky Rubio, and Mike Conley.

Dude yes they did.  He didn't even wear it till basically the very end of the season.  Here's an article from when it happened that notes the main argument all season against Simmons is that who wasn't *really* a rookie:  https://www.sbnation.com/2018/4/10/17222466/donovan-mitchell-ben-simmons-rookie-of-the-year-award-race-beef-hoodie-jazz-76ers
He was a legit rookie. Donovan Mitchell created this narrative so he could win.
"Zach has been averaging 25-5-5 for years now, all that while shooting 40+% from 3 and having insane athleticism, people just glossed over him because he played on some of the worst teams in the league.  For example, there's no statistical argument that supports Jayson Tatum or Donovan Mitchell being substantially better than LaVine in the last three seasons, yet 99% of this sub would've said so before this year just because they played in better teams."
"Donovan Mitchell is the most comical character in there. He doesn't even know what's happening, he just wants to look angry and dangerous."
"The Bulls and Warriors. I think the Jazz have the potential to match the Warriors offensive output, and Donovan Mitchell has already shown he can go blow for blow with any superstar in the league"
"Judging by the Phoenix series, Chris Paul would probably disagree with you. I'm guessing Donovan Mitchell probably would as well."
"Donovan Mitchell spent 500,000$ from his first paycheck so his sister could pay off college debt"
"I mean, he quite clearly did. Would you like to watch videos of Donovan Mitchell destroying him over and over? It happened."
I could just as easily post Donovan Mitchell abusing Jokic for in pick and rolls for like 35 out of 50+ pts in a playoff game lol
Official heights are usually wrong. I have no idea why that‚Äôs considered normal but a couple years back a bunch of players had their heights corrected. Donovan Mitchell fell from like 6‚Äô3 to 6‚Äô1
"True, but it‚Äôs Giannis/LeBron/Curry/Durant level money, when he was a Lillard/Jimmy Butler/Donovan Mitchell level player."
"I mean, he was a terrible exec because of his lack of desire to put in the work (he kept turning down the job for that reason, but Dolan's a dummy and kept throwing money at him). Plus, wasted so many years trying to implement the triangle via a bunch of bad HCs instead of being adaptable. And drafting Franky Smokes over Donovan Mitchell. That said, a few things he did right were NOT trading 1st round draft picks and realizing that Porzingis should be traded due to how injury prone he could potentially be."
"Exactly, on/off and advanced stats are not good at evaluating defense so the numbers OP posted should be taken with a grain of salt.   Jokic also had the worst rim protection numbers of any starting centre in the league last season. Donovan Mitchell, Damian Lillard, CP3 had historically great playoff series attacking Jokic. Nuggets actively tanked one season to avoid the Harden/Jokic matchup in the playoffs."

Is it just me or are the Jazz announcers being bitches? Donovan Mitchell and Joe Ingles clearly put their hands on the refs. Donny pushed one and Joe almost hit one in the face along with pushing. And when Gobert grabbed Turner to pull him down they we acting like he didn't do anything.
"Seems weird, especially after the thread of [Donovan Mitchell calling out the lack of support for a young girl being bullied leading to her suicide](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/qrrie2/walden_donovan_mitchell_opens_his_postshootaround/) being on the front page right now."
Ant Edwards and Donovan Mitchell. Both at similar efficiencies
"He has a 7'5 wingspan, he is basically 7ft out there. I don't know why people are so obsessed with height. Standing reach and wingspan are way more important. There is a reason Donovan Mitchell never looks small on the court. The guy is just 6'1, but has a 6'10 wingspan and weighs like 220-225. Massive hands and wears size 17 shoes. Same thing with Rondo. Just 6'0 with a near 7 ft wingspan and massive hands. Young Rondo was also ridiculously quick and agile. Some of these guys are just built different."
"sick whataboutism, every city has problems, you're right. Jazz fans (especially in the playoffs) are getting a reputation of getting racist when they heckle players and their family. The most famous incidents happening with Russell Westbrook and Ja Morant. Granted this is far from ""all Jazz fans are racist"" but that's not a reputation your city/fanbase wants. Hopefully Donovan Mitchell being a positive role model is a step in the right direction."
"I moved to Utah and went to a Jazz game a couple years ago. Mitchell stood out all the way from the upper deck because even when he was on the sidelines, he was up on his feet and cheering on his team. He's an absolute leader and a great person. The Jazz definitely have become my 2nd favorite team in large part due to Donovan."
Steph made the game so that others could thrive. I see Donovan Mitchell possibly being up there too by the end of it all.
"I think in the 15-20 range. The players you are comparing him to there are people like Rudy Gobert, Jaylen Brown, Donovan Mitchell, Zion and Bam. That seems about right to me."
"westbrook is so good in the playoffs, that's why he's been outplayed by mario chalmers, ricky rubio, rookie donovan mitchell, rajon rondo's little brother, and ben simmons one week before a historic collapse  how long will it take you guys to realize his triple doubles are less than meaningless? there is no player in the history of this league that has had a greater negative impact on their own teams in the playoffs"
"As an old school fan, I looooove Jimmy but he‚Äôs also a bit of an asshole / had a very hard life and is not on the same page with younger stars that were highly coddled from age 14+.  So KAT could still work out but he needs someone like Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young, or a similar player that wants to be the guy. But on his own he just doesn‚Äôt have the fire to lead a team."
"Yo OP, your tables are a little messed up. If you put --- | --- | --- | --- between the header and the rest of the table, it will change it into a much better looking version:  Player|2021-21|2020-21|Diff ---|---|---|--- Damian Lillard|3.2|7.2|-4 Bradley Beal|4|7.7|-3.7 Trae Young|5.3|8.7|-3.4 Collin Sexton|3.5|6.4|-2.9 James Harden|4.6|7.3|-2.7 De'Andre Hunter|1|3.7|-2.7 Kyle Lowry|1|3.5|-2.5 Kemba Walker|1.2|3.5|-2.3 Donovan Mitchell|3.9|6|-2.1 Joel Embiid|8.6|10.7|-2.1  Well, I had to change the spaces between the numbers into | but it looks better that way, and you can even sort it based on the column"
Monk will have a better career than Donovan Mitchell‚Ä¶
"ha ha I do love me some chicken.  My wife is not a fan of replacing thanksgiving turkey with chicken - she just doesn't get it.    I have to say, whether the narrative of utah is true or not, I love the shift we're seeing with Donovan mitchell and D-Wade coming here and embracing the place.  Mike Conley and Jordan Clarkson sign new contracts with us and we recruited Whiteside and Rudy Gay.  No one wants to shed the idea of us hating on black people more than the average fan who just appreciates good dudes playing good ball."
"I like Donovan Mitchell over Luka for starting backcourt right now.  Luka has great numbers but his efficiency is poor.  I know he basically has to do everything himself, but I think he's actually struggled so far.  I don't see a good case for him over Mitchell right now other than reputation.  That being said, it's so early in the season still...   Edit:  or maybe Chris Paul.  I would have them both over struggling Doncic at this point."
"Also Donovan Mitchell is still only 25 and JUST got off his rookie contract. That‚Äôs the time to start adding depth, not blowing it up!"
Donovan Mitchell is pretty small and he seems to be doing just fine. His shooting percentage isn‚Äôt great right now but he has been really good. I never thought of him as a foul baiter at all though
"that first jazz game was at home, and it was without donovan mitchell.   clarkson broke his early season slump and dropped 30 points on them  and the game against the suns there was no ayton  and of course no klay or kyrie in the warriors or nets losses  next up nuggets with no murray, then bucks with probably no lopez or middleton  hawks are pretty much as healthy as they can get and they are losing to teams missing key players"

"Maybe Jaylen Brown, Donovan Mitchell or Devin Booker?  Assuming age isn't a criteria."
"Westbrook has always been tough to watch. Bad shots from a guy that can't shoot and bad decision making is like a pet peeve.   This ones gonna be unpopular but Giannis can be hard to watch sometimes. Not as much now as like pre 2021. In the playoffs in previous years he can turn very tunnel visionny, just drive straight with his head down and throw up a bad layup with 6 hands in front of him. He often doesn't know where to go off the ball too, he'll stand in the way of the ball handler bringing his defender toward his guy. He's obviously gotten better at this things but his iq just wasn't always there. He's still undeniable one of the best in the league regardless   I'm sure there's definitely others that I can't think of rn but guys like Jimmy (Idk just doesn't visually wow me as a player but I like him), Donovan Mitchell (specifically in the regular season, I guess also being the rest of the jazz isn't super entertaining individually but I don't rush home to see jazz games), Kawhi (also in the regular season, he just seems like he coasts most of the time until the playoffs) I just don't go out of my way to watch"
"Yes, [yes I do](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/psavhc/russell_westbrook_working_on_his_new_jumpshot/hdpzpla/?context=999).  &gt; As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.  &gt;  &gt; Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.  &gt;  &gt; Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.  &gt;  &gt; It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.  &gt;  &gt; Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters: &gt;  &gt; |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| &gt; |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| &gt; |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| &gt; |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| &gt; |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| &gt; |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| &gt; |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| &gt; |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| &gt; |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| &gt; |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| &gt; |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| &gt; |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| &gt; |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| &gt; |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| &gt; |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| &gt; |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| &gt; |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| &gt; |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| &gt; |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| &gt; |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| &gt; |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| &gt; |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| &gt; |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| &gt; |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| &gt; |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| &gt; |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| &gt; |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| &gt; |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| &gt; |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| &gt; |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| &gt; |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| &gt; |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| &gt; |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| &gt; |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| &gt; |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393| &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) &gt; Generated 9/21/2021."
"I actually like this answer. There‚Äôs players I‚Äôm more frustrated with/for like JC, but he‚Äôs still running the plays that worked for him last year and the coach wants him to. Donovan is the player I get annoyed with the most on individual plays bc they are high risk medium reward plays and I know he knows better on some of these.   Still my favorite jazz player but I get being pissed at some of his plays.   It‚Äôs a great problem to have if a stud like mitchell is the person whose plays piss you off the most on a team"
"If you reduce it to a single game, Donovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray scoring 50 points against each other in a playoff game was also historic."
"Because they‚Äôre both 6‚Äô1. they don‚Äôt work well together. Sexton would start next to SGA or Ja 100%. Sexton‚Äôs a decent defender too, he‚Äôs just limited next to Garland who‚Äôs also tiny.   Sexton is very similar to Donovan Mitchell. Donovan wouldn‚Äôt work next to a tiny, bad defensive PG either"
"As crazy as this may sound - Donovan Mitchell.  He's my favorite player on the Jazz, but I also hate when he forces things. He seems to go to extremes. He'll either be dominating or he'll forcing the ball into a turnover with almost no in-between."
"2015 what if Knicks drafted Booker instead of a snake in the grass, KP.   2017 what if Knicks drafted Donovan Mitchell instead of Frank Ntlakina.  2018 what if Knicks drafted SGA instead of Kevin Knox  Plus the missed on Steph Curry.   It‚Äôs hard being a Knicks fan."
"There is zero chance that Morey gets anything decent for Simmons. Nobody wants to trade for a proven Jake, especially one that passes up last-minute dunks in the playoffs. I still can‚Äôt believe they gave ROY to this guy over a straight-up playoff assassin like Donovan Mitchell. He should just Mail that trophy to SLC."

Ja donovan Mitchell  CP3 SGA  Pool is top 3 MIP though just gotta beat Bridges
"&gt;e was really bad the first four and was a major reason they were down 1-3.  They went down mostly because nobody could stop Donovan Mitchell, and Melo was just completely worthless on both ends. To the point where the team just basically froze him out in the last 2 games and barely played him.   Also not a coincidence they won 2/3 games they shot over 31% from 3 in. Russ should take a lot of the blame for the game 3 loss where they shot 50% from 3. He had 8 TOs and shot like shit on a night most everyone else was doing well, and also was letting Rubio do everything."
lmao 4-15 from 3 donovan mitchell? all team second?

Donovan Mitchell
"Are Donovan and Bam friends? I saw Mitchell shoving Bam lightly as they both walked to their benches. It looked friendly, but."
"I watched Kansas games night in night out at the time because I like college basketball and because I am a phoenix suns fan and my team was awful at the time so I watched all the ""top"" prospects a lot. I understand it might feel like hindsight but like I said on draft night I knew we waisted the pick when we took him. I remember swearing up a storm with my friends I was watch the draft with that year. I wanted fox, Lonzo or OG Anunoby that year, Particularly OG. As I said at the time OG is what people think josh Jackson is. Before he was injured his sophomore year OG moved up as high as 7th on draft boards and if he hadn't tore his ACL he would have went top 5 instead of falling to 23rd or whatever it was.  and I knew OG was likely not gonna play most if not all his rookie year so we would have gotten a quality player and been able to tank again for luka. Sadly enough we got the 2018 #1 pick and didn't take luka. I'm not some amazing draft expert who is right all the time. Like everyone I get some things right and somethings wrong. But I was 100% right on pretty much everything in that 2017 draft class. It was probably my best draft year and thats unlikely to change anytime soon. I wasn't a believer in Markell though I thought he would be better than he is. I did believe in Tatum though I didn't think he was gonna be quite as good as he is. The only real thing in that class I didn't have the right read on was that I wasn't a Donovan Mitchell believer. Thought he would be a ok rotation guy.   And now that I basically put out all of my best draft takes ever here are some of my wrong takes so you know I am not just doing hindsight stuff. I believed Dragan bender was gonna be a star. I thought Jalen Brown was an awful pick at 3. I thought buddy hield was too old (that one taught me a good lesson). I thought Bamba was better than ayton. That one might still end up being true long term with how bamba has looked to start the year but its extremely unlikely if we are being honest about it. I fell too in love with sexton after the 3 on 5 game and had him over Trae. I wasn't a lemelo ball believer.   As for your point on the break. I believe Jackson is a better athlete then MacLemore and was in college. I am not arguing that he wasn't a monster on the break. He was at his best when he was borderline playing out of control. Which is how the fast break is played. its fast and there is space to make plays because there aren't 10 players at 1 end of the floor. The issue isn't nba schemes its that he can't be out of control and be successful in the nba because guys will take a charge or in the half court he will turn it over. I unfortunately have watch Jackson play in too many nba games than I wish to have seen him play in and his problem (at least when he was with the suns) isn't that he's overthinking. its that he isn't thinking at all. He is always trying to be that borderline out of control guy when the ball is in his hands. he almost wants to create controlled chaos. But he can't do that in the half court because teams are too smart, too athletic, and too disciplined for him to really let him create that kind of problem for them. And while he isn't the worst defender or even really a bad defender at all he can't consistently create enough turnovers to make his fast break skills a consistent asset for him. not to mention as the clip shows, he is a sub par finisher around the rim for nba standards"
"No one wants to come to Portland and LMA left a team that was on pace to win 60+ games before it got injured.  He wanted to tank after LMA left so Dame would get some help via talent in the draft but Dame+CJ was too good.  Otherwise, his biggest blunder is the 2017 draft where Dame begged Olshey to acquire Donovan Mitchell but it didn't happen since the front office went with Zach Collins instead."
"KAT is a great offensive player and a good guy, but he doesn't have a leadership mentality. That doesn't mean he can't be a great player - Kareem was similar - but he needs a co-pilot to help lead the team, and to run interference with the press.      For example, Kobe was amazing player, but abrasive at best, and from what I've read, much more of a loner than Jordan, with whom he shared / copied many of his negative traits. But at different times, he had Shaq, Pau, and not least of them, Derrick Fischer, who wasn't a great player but was a compelling enough leader to be the president of the players association.   D'Lo isn't that guy, Ant is too young, and Butler, though I love him to bits, defines himself almost by his disgust for showing the sensitivity KAT often shows. (Which absolutely makes sense for Butler if you read up on his life.)  Speaking only on personality, KAT needs someone like Donovan Mitchell, Dame, or even Trae Young. But on his own he's just not going to get there."
And Donovan Mitchell just for salary matching purposes
"Yea but there are success cases as well.  People like Jamal Murray, and Donovan Mitchell etc...  it's a bet but it's not a 100% fail rate bet."

"Klay Thompson, CP3, Jrue Holiday, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Trae young, and more are ALL &gt; Westbrook"
"Donovan plays much better defense, and Doncic usage rate is way higher, which accounts for higher scoring totals. Mitchell is the better shooter, he just had the ball in his hands less."
"Half is too high but he‚Äôs definitely in the 18-25 range. Players I‚Äôd definitely take over him:  1) Lebron 2) Giannis 3) Curry 4) Harden 5) AD 6) Jokic 7) Luka 8) Dame 9) Kawhi 10) Jason Tatum 11) Joel Embiid 12) Zion 13) Donovan Mitchell 14) Kyrie 15) CP3 16) Paul George 17) Trae Young  I‚Äôd also struggle to put him over Devin Booker, Butler, And Beal."
"Booker &gt; Mitchell and LaVine   I think Donovan is heavily overrated by his playoff numbers for the past 2 seasons (although it‚Äôs a decent sample size, his Bubble run had him shooting an anomaly 52% from 3). He‚Äôs still a great player and not too far behind Booker. LaVine is similar in that so many people on this sub are quick to put him over both of these other guys because he had a great regular season where he shot well from beyond the arc and had high volume scoring. LaVine averaged 28.5 (per 75) on 63% TS this past season, but Book averaged 26.3 (per 75) on 62% TS in 2020, so to say that LaVine is clear of Book efficiency-wise is ridiculous. Book has had multiple of these high volume + high efficiency seasons, and his numbers appear to have regressed this season only because of his reduced role.  Mitchell averaged 75.2 touches per game last season. LaVine averaged 68.0. Booker averaged 56.2. The former two have different roles on their team than 2021 Book, and they‚Äôre more similar to young Book, who was often the only spark for his team‚Äôs offense. Book has consistently been at the top of the league in points generated per touch (both scoring, and scoring + assisting), so to say that anyone is clear of him efficiency-wise because they had a great shooting season is disingenuous.  Now stats aside, I think the eye test and results would support Booker more as well. LaVine and Spida are both easily better from 3, Booker is easily better in the midrange, and Booker‚Äôs actually been a much more elite and consistent finisher than anyone gives him credit for. He can also knock down his FTs at a better clip than the other 2, once he starts to get half the calls he deserves. He‚Äôs more versatile offensively in that he can score reliably from almost anywhere, and he uses his build and footwork to post-up a lot more than the other two as well. His only glaring weakness is his pull-up 3P%. His playmaking is better than the other two in my opinion, even though they‚Äôre all capable 2-guess playmakers. Donovan at 6‚Äô1 would be expected to be able to play like an elite point, but I feel like he lacks a lot of the vision and consistent playmaking ability that Book provides, and LaVine is just a lesser version of Point Book in that regard as well.   Book‚Äôs off-ball game is also well clear of the other two, but that is partially a result of his reduced role now. Defensively, none of the 3 are studs, but Book and LaVine showed that they can be good defenders at the Olympics, and Book had a lot of flashes of it in the NBA season as well, now that he‚Äôs surrounded by a good team defense. His biggest flaw is probably his inability to fight over screens (because he can‚Äôt make himself skinny enough), and slow lateral movement (but he‚Äôs getting better at this, and isn‚Äôt ball-watching too much anymore either). I feel like Spida‚Äôs defense has actually regressed from his past self, but he‚Äôs still a capable defender for his height, it‚Äôs just that he doesn‚Äôt have the size to deal with a lot of players. Utah‚Äôs team defense is also just a one-man show, since they force all their defenders into Gobert, who has to guard his man and help at the same time.  And finally, results. The Jazz have made the playoffs for the past few years, but I would hardly say Mitchell is the floor raiser there. Booker‚Äôs first season with a comparable roster to Mitchell, they made the 10-seed in an injury-riddled year, and the next season, he made it to the Finals as the clear best player and only consistent scorer on the team for 2/4 series. LaVine will likely get his shine in the first or second round next year, so that empty stats narrative will likely die out.   Overall, I just think Book is the better player and has proven himself better than the other two. I welcome differing opinions, but to act as if the debate isn‚Äôt close is ridiculous. Additional hot take, Tatum isn‚Äôt fully clear of this group at all, and Trae and Beal are also in this conversation for these lower All-NBA caliber guys."
Maybe it's recency bias but I truly think donovan Mitchell is a top 3 shooting guard
"Jaylen Brown &gt; Booker, Lavine, Murray, Ja, Donovan Mitchell, Ben Simmons"
He's a poor man shadow clone of Donovan Mitchell at best. A patient team who has no expectations but developing would get him good value.
"Love how upvotes could mean you might actually be making people think about it and agree, or they're just not that hot of a take to begin with.  Also homer takes getting downvoted, as they should be. Nobody needs to hear how Zach Lavine is better than Donovan Mitchell or Jayson Tatum coming from a Bulls fan."
"I guess we‚Äôll disagree on whether well-set screens are considered creating offense or not. And my point with the player comparisons is that not all stars are paid for excellent performance on both ends of the floor. Some players, like a LeBron, are elite at practically every aspect of the game but many others aren‚Äôt, like Rudy Gobert‚Äôs offense James Harden‚Äôs defense for example. Rudy gets paid mainly for his defensive abilities and his offensive intangibles, such as screens. But, do keep in mind that he isn‚Äôt paid the supermax by the Jazz in part because of what he lacks on the offensive end, and in part because the Jazz need the money elsewhere to be true contenders.   And the All-Star game is just a night of entertainment and is full of flashy offensive moves. Anyone, including LeBron and Kevin Durant can recognize that Rudy‚Äôs abilities aren‚Äôt flashy or fun, but they do matter in real, complete basketball which the All-Star game definitely is not. I don‚Äôt think anyone was surprised that Rudy was picked last, and most of the disrespect was towards the Jazz stars generally thanks to the fact that Donovan Mitchell was the second-to-last player picked.  And you being a Lakers fan isn‚Äôt relevant, so my apologies if I came off as rude. It‚Äôs just in my blood as a basketball fan to slander the Lakers organization and their fans but I really don‚Äôt mean anything by it.  Carry on!"
"Fair enough to think that from Mitchell, but did he forget about the Lakers and Nets? Who not only are considered by like 90% of fans to be better than the Jazz, but also had more and worse injuries?   Even if Nuggets and Clippers weren‚Äôt going to beat the Jazz, way more chance than not that the Lakers and Nets do. So no slight to Donovan, but I feel like if the nets or lakers were healthy, then only they were going to win the ring.  (Of course I could be wrong, but if you think of the best Utah can be, then you have to do that for every team)."
jaylen brown is better than donovan mitchell and zach lavine (and sometimes dbook)
De Aaron fox&gt; Donovan Mitchell
"Exactly.    Donovan Mitchell raises his game in the playoffs much more than Harden does.     I'd still take Harden over Mitchell in the playoffs though, because Harden is still better."
"Boy stop. Y‚Äôall couldn‚Äôt defend, your center couldn‚Äôt defend on the perimeter &amp; he can‚Äôt create his own offense or make a midrange jumper. Donovan Mitchell one of my favorite players, but he knows they‚Äôre not a real contender with the way they play defense and rely really solely on him."
This is where Donovan Mitchell turns heel ladies and gents..
I work in education and have had our staff use Donor's Choose to get devices for their classrooms. It can be really helpful for helping fill needs that aren't able to be met through traditional funding (public schools get underfunded throughout most of the US).   I love that Donovan Mitchell has not only got involved in making this kind of charitable commitment to educators and children but that he's also reportedly defending CRT against asshole political opportunists at the same time.  Utah is lucky to have that man play for the Jazz.
"Lol I'm sitting here wondering why no one is mentioning Donovan Mitchell, completely forgetting that he wasn't even in this draft class."
"&gt; Essentially Mitchell wants it taught in schools and Adams does not. Adams basically told Mitchell in the video to stay in his lane.  Which is ironic, considering Donovan almost definitely has more education on the issue than Adams"
"Donovan mitchell is my favorite athlete of all time, ahead of the great brian dawkins and am I die hard fan of both the eagles and the Jazz"
I know athletes have power but I can't wrap my head around Donovan Mitchell affecting state politics to the point that him being unhappy is making state politicians think twice about the legislature they want to pass.
"Oh no, how awful, must be aggravating  In other news, I am a Donovan Mitchell fan now"
"Based on the title, at first I thought Donovan Mitchell had some beef with the athletic lol"
This is a weird article. A lot of this was covered (more clearly too) five days ago here:      https://www.deseret.com/utah/2021/9/8/22663062/utah-jazz-donovan-mitchell-didnt-understand-critical-race-theory-debate-stuart-adams-says-video
I still have no idea who is saying Donovan Mitchell is unhappy with them.
"MCW‚Äôs first game is obvious, but Linsanity is probably never happening again.   The Jamal Murray vs Donovan Mitchell series we just experienced, especially the 50 v 50 game, was something really unique and special and I doubt either player is ever that good again."
"&gt; Meh, weirdly it doesn't happen with someone like Morant, it didn't happen with KD, it didn't happen with Embiid, it hasn't happened with Trae, with Jokic. It happens when teams do a shitty job.  The one you've missed out is Shai. Because he would absolutely be a star with the Knicks, or any big market team trying to win. He's anywhere from the 3rd-6th best shooting guard in the league, he's two years older than Zion and his team is actively trying to lose. The only trade rumours we get for Shai are that maybe OKC doesn't want him, not that he wants to be elsewhere.  If it was just a case of a team having a star player but the team does a shitty job there'd be *way* more noise on other players. And it certainly didn't stop the chatter about Giannis leaving when Jrue was traded, if anything it made it louder. *Last season* there was noise that Devin-fucking-Booker was looking for a way out. Stop trying to look for a rational, objective, basketball-oriented reason in the noise because that's not the explanation it's transparently markets, transparently media and transparently views-driven. It's usually the Knicks or the Lakers (Dame, Beal, Zion, Booker) the star usually has to be well known (hence nothing for Donovan Mitchell, but plenty for Zion and Giannis) and usually it's a player from a small media market. It's not that complicated. If you say Zion might join the team the needle landed on on your wheel of teams-with-large-fanbases people will click on the thing, or listen to your thing, or watch your thing, and you can make money from that."
"I'm one of the biggest Donovan Mitchell fans and that series had me seriously questioning the guy. Even though he was good, just seeing another go absolutely supernova against Don was disheartening."

"Donovan Mitchell committed a horrible back court violation in JAZZ‚Äôs  series against the NUGGETS in the bubble  .It was the game him and Murray went toe to toe. He scored 57 that game, but that backcourt violation sucked the momentum out of the JAZZ immediately after a make by Murray. That series went to 7."
Now post when Westbrook got embarrassed by Ricky Rubio and rookie Donovan Mitchell lmao
"Sixers pls, let this man turn into donovan mitchell east.  my god we‚Äôre getting goran dragic arent we"
"Yep. The NBA is much more positionless today than it was back then. Back then there were clear differences between a shooting guard and a small forward rather than just looking at it like a couple wings. The Lakers thought Kobe's growth as a player made Eddie Jones redundant, so they traded him for an All Star SF in Rice.   A similar trade today would be trading a young All Star for an older one. This isn't a great comparison (mainly cause the game has changed so much, so doing this today wouldn't make any sense), but it would be like if Utah had a 20 year old Kobe coming up and it looked looked like he might make Donovan Mitchell redundant (see how nobody would think that anymore?), so instead the Jazz trade him for Jimmy Butler because they feel like they have a bigger need at SF and they're trying to win right away.   Jones was 27 and a 2x All Star and Rice was 31 and a 3x All Star at the time of the trade. Mitchell is 25 and a 2x All Star, while Butler is 31 and a 5x All Star. It should be pointed out though that Donovan Mitchell is better than Eddie Jones was, and also that Jimmy Butler is better than Glen Rice was, but this is the most comparable kind of trade I could come up with."
"Innuendos aside, Donovan Mitchell is just pure joy, even when he had a bad game he's all about praising someone else who played well"
"Maybe I am alone in this but have you guys noticed that dunks in the NBA have regressed from this time. When people were throwing down crazy in game dunks.  Carter, Kobe, mason, j rich like these dudes We‚Äôre always doing windmills, spins, and other more dunk style dunks and games. Nowadays most of the in game dunks are more like cocked back tomahawk style or just two handed.  I watch a lot of Donovan Mitchell and Jason Tatum and I can‚Äôt tell you how many times on fast brakes or by themselves they will just go in and barely dunk with two hands almost just laying the ball inside the hoop. They obviously have some sick dunks and Donovan won the dunk contest with awesome dunks but he doesn‚Äôt do that type of stuff in the game too much. It just seem like around 2005 if you were on a break away in the NBA you‚Äôre putting on a show. I remember Tony Allen when he was with Boston on a break away in Denver bounced It off the ground to himself jumped and windmill it. TA ain‚Äôt even a known dunker and he showing bunnies on a break away. It‚Äôs like no one does that stuff anymore."
Can‚Äôt believe he got rookie of the year over Donovan Mitchell‚Ä¶
He is not as good as the following players Lebron  Kd  Giannis  Kawhi  Luka  Paul George  Steph  Dame  Klay  Embiid  Jimmy butler   Donovan Mitchell  Nikola jokic  Jamal Murray  Tatum  Rudy gobert  Bradley beal  Trae young  Kyrie Irving  James Harden   Anthony Davis  Devin Booker   Chris paul  So I put him around the top 25ish
"He's absolutely a star, he just isn't a superstar. He's in that Jaylen Brown/Devin Booker/Rudy Gobert/Khris Middleton/Donovan Mitchell"
i like donovan mitchell more day by day
"This is why I'm always so confused when people say that black players should leave Utah for their own good because it's white and racist. Utah NEEDS black voices specifically BECAUSE it is white and racist. It needs people like Donovan Mitchell. People shouldn't be disappointed when they see a black player choose to play in a place like Utah, they should appreciate the difference they can make in the area."
Why? Aren't USA is a democratic country? Every single american citizen have the rights tp sway political matters by their opinion including donovan mitchell.
"&gt;Yes, 20 yo athlete that never held a book in his hands is you source of education. The fuck those adults know, amiright?  Why do you think Donovan Mitchell has never held a book in his hands?"
"Yeah LeBron his teams are too old I bet for the streak to last long enough. However an interesting one is Jeff Green due to duration and being on a billion different teams.   1999: Kurt Thomas  2000-2002: Shaq 2003: Richard Jefferson 2004: Shaq  2005: Nazr Mohammed  2006: Shaq 2007: Ira Newble/LeBron 2008: KG 2009: JJ Redick 2010: KG 2011: Tyson Chandler  2012: Kevin Durant  2013: Ray Allen 2014: Ray Allen 2015: LeBron  2016: LeBron 2017: LeBron 2018: LeBron 2019: Kevin Durant  2020: LeBron 2021: Jae Crowder   His streak I bet lasts a long time. Teammates already with: Durant, LeBron, Jokic(about to be), Westbrook, Harden, Donovan Mitchell, Gobert, Beal, CP3, Kyrie. That streak will probably last a fair bit. He has ties to all the top teams this year: LAC(Ibaka), LAL, BKN, Den, Utah, Phx, Mil(Bobby Portis), Atl(Lou Will) etc"
"Malik Monk..he‚Äôs a good player but I thought he would be doing what Donovan Mitchell is doing‚Ä¶that being said you can‚Äôt tell me Malik Monk won‚Äôt be an allstar eventually, idc."
I love Donovan Mitchell.
"Utah Senate President Stuart Adams notes how the state‚Äôs bid to ban Critical Race Theory from being taught in schools was met with pushback by ‚Äúvery popular sports stars‚Äù such as Donovan Mitchell.  Then adds a bit condescendingly, **‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a lot of work to do to educate him.‚Äù**  Bro."
"i mean, Fultz and Thybulle were the only two who shot over 30% from 3 in conference play and UW without Fultz lost multiple games by 20 or more  Fultz was at 24/5.5/5.5 in conference play   plus there‚Äôs never been a better PnR player at the college level i‚Äôve ever seen. that was the foundation of his game because he could hit that pull-up from the elbow like Kyrie, but his jumper had so much lift he was like a taller donovan mitchell who could also use that screen to launch a 3  he was a better passer than Lonzo (the stats agree) and Fox was his only contemporary imo. Fultz at the u18 FIBA america‚Äôs tourney was the MVP of a team with Trae Young, Jarrett Allen, and Michael Porter Jr.   honestly, i don‚Äôt know what you could want in a point guard if Fultz didn‚Äôt have it"
"I agree with him, that those 4 would probably fair the best, but there are quite a few players who I think would've been much better in previous eras than they are today.  Omitting: TD, Dirk, Kobe, and LBJ, because they all have played very close to that era, and played with alot of guys who were still around from the 90s.  Previous comments mentioned KD, who would be deadly in any era.    (Active) Superstars: Most of them would be those created players that people make the NBA video games.  They'd change alot of the rules to go against these guys, because to be honest it would make things a little unfair. Most of them can shoot 3s (probably better than most 3 point specialist from that time period), pretty well, yet they can do all sorts of things on the court. It would be unfair.   People say physicality would kill alot of these players, but I don't think so easily. If they are at their modern day levels, they'd be taking alot of advantages with them.  They'd be bigger than most people at their positions, as well as being somewhat faster. They'd be able to use all of those tools to their advantage against smaller players. Remember, they are taking the 3 point shooting with them, as well as the athleticism.  These arguments are so vague, because  they almost make no sense.   1. Steph Curry would be pretty nasty in the 90s. People often speak about Reggie and Abdul-Rauf who could play, very well in this current era. Change record books on their own.   Steph has superior handles to both, and is better playmaker.  He can score alot of points, without ever coming into the paint, very much.  2. James Harden -- Is thick with handles, and he can draws fouls. He'd bait alot of aggressive defenders into easy foul calls.  He can shoot 3s, as well.   3. As much as people dislike him, Russell Westbrook, his aggressiveness and toughness would take him along away, and don't let him get on a bad team. He'd really boost his abilities up.   4A. Zion, he'd be greater in the earlier eras.  4B. CP3, pretty obvious.    5. Joel Embiid, he could play his game, a little bit more, though he would bring the good outside/3 point shooting with him, which would catch alot of teams, and opposing centers off guard.  They wouldn't able to hang out in the paint on defense.  People keep forgetting aspect, because it would take most centers (even the great ones) out of their element.   6. Luka Doncic: His talent crosses eras, like everyone above.  7. Nikola Jokic: Just like Embiid, he take guys out of their element, similarly to younger Sabonis.  Most centers probably would not be equip to guard a center who can pass, like a guard and shoot like 3 point specialist. Also, he can score from any given point on offense.   8. Giannis Antetokounmpo -- He'd be sickening in previous decades. There's almost no one who is comparable to him, outside of Olajuwon and Garnett. But, the kicker is that Giannis might be a bit more faster and agile than both, while also being a bit more stronger. He also handles the ball, like a guard.   9. As unpopular as he is right now, Ben Simmons. His height, point guard skills, and defensive abilities, alone would make him highly coveted. He'd fit in alot of times, especially if they have other guys who can score.  Also, I feel like more coaches would just make him post up, more, especially against smaller defenders.  In some of these previous eras, he could get away with not shooting or scoring, too much. Coaches would want him to take more of those easy opportunities.  The thing is with Embiid, Jokic, and even Giannis, they are very efficient and diverse scorers/playmakers, as the two centers are pretty above average shooters for any type of players.  10. Dame -- Pretty obvious.  11. Jimmy Butler -- He's pretty intense. So, he'd fit in pretty good.   12. AD -- Talented across the board, like Embiid and Jokic. He's also a good defender, like Embiid.   13. Kyrie Irving -- He wouldn't drop off, very much, if it at all. Still an all-star.   14. Bradley Beal -- Still pretty good.  15. Zach Lavine - He'd be a pretty good player in the 90s, like he is now. People sleep on him, sometimes.   16. Devin Booker: Definitely  17. D'Angelo Russell: His game would be more competitive in that era.   18. Brandon Ingram: He falls into that KD, Giannis, and Ben Simmons category.  19. Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown: Not much of drop off, or a change. They'd be about the same, but slightly better.   20. Donovan Mitchell: Not much of a drop-off, or change.   21. DeAaron Fox: About the same.  22. Bam Adebayo: He fit perfectly into previous eras.   22. Draymond Green: I know people think he'd fold up, like a chair in previous eras. But, he's an elite defender in any era. He'd be compared to Rodman, alot. Which is not a good comparison, outside of the dirty play. Because, Draymond is a pretty good playmaker, and can also guard all five positions in switches and in one-on-one situations.  Green and Rodman are very close to each other on defense, almost splitting hairs. I feel like Rodman guarded bigs better, though I feel Draymond is more equipped to handle smaller, shiftier wings.   23. Trae Young: Similar to several smaller point guards in the 90s, against the main question of physicality. He is a smaller point guard, though he is pretty elite tough shot maker. He's pretty speedy and has great handles, as well.  24. Ja Morant: About the same.     I'm not quite sure: Karl Anthony Towns: He's very talented offensively, very unique. Could he still be in top 5 or 6, I'm not quite sure.   Jamal Murray:  Older players:  Derrick Rose: Pretty comparable to many wing scorers from the 90s. DeMarcus Cousins: Definitely Kevin Love: He has unique set of skills. DeMar Derozan: He has great scoring ability.  John Wall  Jabari Parker/Andrew Wiggins: They both would have the green-light to shoot and score, especially in the 90s and early 2000s, where ball movement was pretty low across the league.   Guys you wouldn't think, but would be much more relied upon:  Julius Randle Nikola Vuƒçeviƒá Enes Kanter Derrick Favors Jalil Okafor   Sidenote: If I missed some players, it was not in intentional.  It's quite few guys to list."
"Said it before but Donovan Mitchell is what the state of Utah needs. He's free to go wherever and I'll always be a fan, but the fact that he's standing up for these things in a predominantly white state is commendable."
"The wingspans some players have is insane. Like Donovan Mitchell is 6'1"" with a 6'11"" wingspan or Kawhi being 6'7"" with a 7'4"" wingspan"
Rudy was overpaid basically. He likes Donovan Mitchell so I can't remember what he said but basically said he didn't have it to his face to sort of challenge him to get better.
"1) as much as I hate to say it, only Luka is, but I'll allow SGA and Trae. None of those other people have shown anything outside of ""flashes of potential"" imo  2) agree strongly especially with Dame except for Donovan Mitchell. Too early to call  3) you trolling lol  4)agree it's so annoying how people think Dame is some amazing player when he specifically underperforms outside of this year. Esp Portland fans. Portland has done nothing to get him help tho. And no, dragic was never enough.  5) man hell no. Guarantee he doesn't win another ring on the Bucks unless they play a hospitalized NBA again. Their fanbase had me rooting for KD and Harden.  6)magic way better than bird   7)diasgree."
"Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, and Damian Lillard. Everyone loves to overate flashy guards. I‚Äôll say though that as soon as any of them get in a shooting slump, they very quickly become underrated. Small players are inconsistent at times. When they get hot, everyone hops on their D and says they are the next steph. A couple bad shooting nights and they are overrated chuckers."
Disguise the Pain Donovan or Mask the Pain Mitchell
Lol Donovan is a scrub compared to booker. You replace book with Mitchell and the suns don't sniff the nba finals
Donovan Mitchell lives in Utah. He literally plays    for the Jazz    I‚Äôm a Heat fan but I don‚Äôt live in Miami.. like Wtf are you even on about
&gt; I think he's going to surprise a LOT of people and sort of become the Eastern Conference Donovan Mitchell.  Isn‚Äôt his pullup 3 point shooting the missing ingredient still. Do you think sexton has the ability to step up as a good or great volume off the dribble 3 point shooter?
"People here underrate Sexton. I don't blame them; he fits the archetype of ""guard that only scores and nothing else"" and has played on bad teams so far in his short career. But the level of improvement and production that Sexton has sustained for multiple seasons despite the dearth of talent, spacing, coaching, stability, and luck surrounding him has been nothing short of special.  I don't think the Sex-Love-Simmons trade is likely. However, if somehow Sexton ends up on the Sixers with Embiid and shooters around them, I think he's going to surprise a LOT of people and sort of become the Eastern Conference Donovan Mitchell."
I know all people are distantly related. But I wouldn't be surprised if Donovan Mitchell and Hide the Pain Harold were more closely related than a lot of pairs of people because of how similar their face is.
"Muscle injuries kept him from getting rhythm, and apparently kept him from staying in shape, too. A lot of the drives and finishes you see in the video became missed shots last season, because he didn‚Äôt have the same legs. Attempts would get hung on the rim like he didn‚Äôt get as high as he expected. Some were just bad luck, and you could see it fuck with his confidence   Couple that with no improvement defensively, and I guess the Warriors staff lost faith quickly. They did do him a favor by trading him. He was on the outside looking in for next season‚Äôs rotation, not saying Eric couldn‚Äôt earn his way back in, but they traded him to Utah to team up with his best friend Donovan Mitchell. The Jazz are known for developing 4s, so Paschall becoming a stronger more explosive Paul Milsap would be awesome"
"Donovan Mitchell really grew on me - I couldn‚Äôt stand him during the whole rookie of the year debacle and thought it made him look like a massive sook.   I used to think Tim Duncan was the equivalent of watching beige paint dry. Obviously I was very young then and biased because the Spurs were the Lakers‚Äô biggest competition and have grown to appreciate his playing (also he was on a team with Patty Mills who I love).   I used to hate Blake Griffin - thought he was overrated as hell (and he was on the Clippers) and a pretty boy.  Now I‚Äôm just kind of indifferent towards him.   Who knows ‚Ä¶ maybe in 10 years I‚Äôll come to appreciate Luka (who right now I think of as the whingy obstacle to my country‚Äôs first medal, the soft and shiny individualistic ‚ÄúWonderboy‚Äù contrasting the team-focused Aussies)."
"Donovan Mitchell will have a breakout season, leading him to possible top 10 player discussion"
"&gt; Wasn't Utah's offensive scheme essentially having a lot of great 1-on-1 players (minus Rudy)? Clarkson, Mitchell, Bogdanovic, Ingles, and the rest of the crew was really good at getting their own buckets but not the best at finding open looks via facilitation. Matt Thomas would suck in that.  lol, you need to watch more Jazz basketball.  Utah has lead the league in 3 point attempts for a few years now (not sure if they were always #1 but always at the top)  They do that by moving the ball a lot to find the open man ([aka The Blender](https://youtu.be/TRwqm1-WhFw) ), which usually results in an open 3 point shooter, it's the reason why everyone on the team outside of Rudy can shoot 3's at a high percentage. The only time they get iso heavy as at the end of games when Donovan tends to take over.  Matt couldn't even fit into that system, he was clanking wide open 3's"
"In this modern era, your franchise's developmental program is nowhere near top 3. You sign a lot of guys that are already established and do away with your young talent. A lot of other franchises have that player that they can say they developed into something big. The Jazz has Donovan Mitchell. The Hawks have Trae Young. The Celtics have Jayson Tatum. The Heat have Bam Adebayo. The Pelicans had Anthony Davis and has Zion. The only guy I can see potentially fit that bill for y'all is THT, but only if you keep him."
"One or two players change an entire perspective of an organization. For example if Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell weren't so good, I am sure people would be saying the Utah Jazz are bad at developing and/or drafting players after they had Kanter, Trey Burke, Trey Lyles etc for a while. If the Kings drafted Luka, him along with Fox would have change the entire perspective of the Kings. The Spurs have been so good for so long so they get a lot of leeway because they don't get high round picks so we really don't know and they hit it big with Kawhi. If Spurs had the 4th or 5th pick in the 2013 draft for example, I wonder who they would have picked and if that player would have turned out to be a game changer."
"You would undoubtedly have seen that already imo if LaVine was in Utah in Mitchell‚Äôs place. Playing next to some legitimate NBA point guards (Rubio, Conley) and shooters over the years on a team with a perennial DPOY candidate center, I‚Äôm extremely confident that an alpha scorer as efficient as Zach would consistently have that team in the playoffs. I‚Äôm hesitant to say he would ‚Äúlead‚Äù them to the playoffs because I‚Äôm hesitant to say Mitchell ‚Äúleads‚Äù Utah to the playoffs. He‚Äôs undoubtedly their lead man offensively but Rudy Gobert is the guy who drastically raises the floor of the team and makes them as a playoff lock.   I‚Äôd like to see Donovan Mitchell lead Lauri Markkanen, Wendell Carter Jr, and Denzel Valentine to the playoffs."
He was good but he wasn‚Äôt really close to Mitchell. Solely this playoffs    Booker: 27-6-5 on 55.8 TS%   Donovan: 32-4-6 on 60.4 TS%
bubble donovan mitchell would like to talk
"That duel with Donovan Mitchell was entertaining af, just 2 young dudes giving it absolutely everything"
Hopefully Donovan Mitchell can surpass both of them and become the goat Jazz player. He seems to have a great character along with fantastic skills.
"Donovan Mitchell. Used to think he was a drama queen, now I can appreciate that he really just lives for the shit."
Donovan Mitchell is the same except for his 2nd year
Donovan Mitchell. I originally thought he was inefficient player with too big of a role on an overrated team. He‚Äôs developed into an excellent player and has elevated his game in the last two playoffs.
PLAYERS:     A) Devin Booker   B) Anthony Edwards (2nd half of the year)   C) Donovan Mitchell    B) Collin Sexton
Replace Grayson Allen with Donovan Mitchell and Claxton with Nikola Jokic on a vet minimum
ask donovan mitchell what he thinks about eric gordons defense.
"Its so weird to me guys will list Donovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray as point guards but not Lebron, its like, have you watched any of these guys play?  Because some of them are clearly not point guards."
"Off the top of my head:  Steph  Kyrie/Harden - you choose who you want to call the PG  Dame  CP3 LaMelo Luka Trae Jrue Westbrook   Not sure if Donovan Mitchell counts but he runs the show  Jamal Murray if he comes back healthy, not going to say Jokic because he‚Äôs more a point center obviously  SGA  Ja Morant"
Love this. Didn't Donovan Mitchell do something similar too?
2. Jason Terry  3. Donovan Mitchell  4. Tyson Chandler  5. Jayson Tatum  6. Dwayne Wade  7. Kawhi Leonard  I probably flunked it
"donovan mitchell on the sixers, ben simmons on the jazz. should've clarified  /s obviously but i think theres a non zero chance simmons plays for the sixers. morey clearly doesn't want anyone except dame and dame is on the blazers for the immediate future, at least until around the trade deadline and that's only if the blazers aren't contenders at that point. i think simmons could play this year out in philly"
lol or like sixers-jazz im sure  That would actually be hype as hell though. Donovan Mitchell vs. Ben Simmons. Rookie of the Year battle returns
"For all we know, he could‚Äôve traded back in the 2017 a few spots, trade up a few spots in the 2018 draft, and sign both Donovan Mitchell and Luka Donic"
"To be fair, I think Mitchell has taken advantage of the good situation he's in, with Gobert there to clean up any drives. And honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if Rudy just encourages Donovan to funnel guys in anyway, and it's their gameplan so why not.  That being said, I think it ends up just making Mitchell lazy on defense, which sucks when Gobert isn't flawless on any given night, or a team like the Clippers takes advantage of the matchup."
"Yeah especially with so many 3's now, shooting variance is real. Donovan Mitchell can have a 5 games stretch of shooting 50% or 30% from 3 on the exact same shots and attempts"
"Donovan Mitchell is the worst example on this sub IMO. Dude is a trash defender that has gotten used to Gobert cleaning up all his mistakes, so he puts all his energy into offense."
Donovan Mitchell.
"Nah, Mitchell is overrated if anything. I hate saying that because I love him as a player, but there‚Äôs a lot of context around the numbers he puts up. He‚Äôs in basically the perfect situation to maximize his talents. He‚Äôs got probably the best spacing in the league around him with the most 3 point attempts and Rudy also frequently gets Donovan a ton of space off screens. Also, I wouldn‚Äôt give Mitchell any credit over Beal defensively. He‚Äôs a better defender in theory but in practice he gives bottom of the barrel effort defensively. He can get away with that most of the time like much of our team thanks to Rudy but it‚Äôs definitely a problem.  I also don‚Äôt think Mitchell‚Äôs playoff numbers of late are sustainable. It‚Äôs been a crazy 14 game or so stretch in 2020 and 2021, but he‚Äôs just hitting shots at a rate that it would be highly optimistic to expect to continue. He was also so shockingly bad in the 2019 playoffs idk if he really deserves his rep as someone who will consistently step things up in the postseason. His career efficiency in the playoffs is basically the same as in the regular season.   Beal is a better player as of right now and it‚Äôs not super duper close either. When looking at two guys where 90% of their value is scoring you have to take the one that scores at both a higher rate and higher efficiency."
"Better shooter. Looks great against a lot of defenses. Amazing spot up shooter. Bradley Beal has never been apart of any amazing offense that utilizes his strengths as a player. Donovan Mitchell relies heavily on driving/athleticism, he may not even be the same scorer he is at Brad Beals age. I think Mitchell is great but I think ppl will turn sour on him if he keeps losing series' and having 30 shots a night."
Trae young and Donovan Mitchell.
Donovan Mitchell
"Flukey af, TJ Warren turned into prime MJ, Tyler herro was the next Miami heat great, AD all of a sudden became a great shooter, Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell turned into supernovas. Quite frankly the 2020 playoffs should be expunged from the history books, including the lakers Mickey Mouse ring"
"Lol dudes 36. At some point, people need to accept that he is simply one of the greatest scorers of all time. He‚Äôs 6th in playoff ppg with basically double the games of everyone ahead of him but MJ  (and Donovan Mitchell is also ahead of him)."
"I love posts like this, man. Cheers!  I actually had no idea kuzma got 6'10"", that's bonkers. I definitely think Lebron just got to choose his and they didn't do a remeasuring. I had a post a few months ago discussing the reverse of this, Utah jazz lowering the heights of players by seemingly too much. Donovan Mitchell is giant looking for 6' flat, which is what they had him 19-20. They've now changed it to 6'1... He used to be listed as 6'3"" and in multiple pics with Dwyane Wade he looks the same height.  The Ben Simmons situation (I see a klutch theme here) is probably the worst. 6'9"" to 6'10"" to 6'11"".... The 6'10"" seems less plausible to me but still possible, the 6'11"" one defies reason.   https://m.basketissimo.com/nba/all-star-game-2020-la-vittoria-e-andata-al-team-lebron-20234  Look at Ben Simmons a couple feet away from newly listed 6'11"" jokic. Literally looks 1.5-2 inches shorter and they're both 6'11"" now. I'm not sure who rich Paul paid to get Simmons/lebron their preferred listing lol"
"imagine if only one or the other grew, though.  you could wind up with a wingspan like donovan mitchell, or be like a t-rex on stilts."
I can‚Äôt believe the Mavs took DSJ over Donovan Mitchell.
"Okay, I admit more than 1 person has speculated this.  You and that Jazz podcast host baselessly speculating with zero info, and whose speculation goes directly against every single report from people with actual information, isn't a win for you....  My point was that zero people with any info have suggested Murray will miss the whole year.  Matter of fact, the exact opposite is true.  So while you can hang your hat on semantics, your original comment that there has been speculation Murray will miss the whole year is entirely misleading.  If you are using the word ""speculation"" so literally that it can be 2 random people with no info has thrown out an idea that contradicts actual info, then anyone can say ""there's been speculation that _____"" and it can technically be true.    ""There's been speculation Donovan Mitchell will demand a trade in week 1 of the season.""  Just because my buddy said that doesn't mean I should go spreading it online as if it is a valid theory with any weight behind it.  That Jazz podcast host was literally just wishfully thinking it to be true, which is honestly fucked up.   There has been zero speculation *by anyone remotely in the know* that he will miss the whole year.  Hopefully that's better since it is literally true and your whole argument centers on semantics."
"No no, random dudes who have no idea saying random shit isn't what I'm talking about.  I used the word ""noted"" and not ""speculated"" for a reason.  It's a Jazz fan who completely arbitrarily says ""I have Jamal Murray as not playing this year.""  Based on....literally zero insider info.  Baseless speculation is moronic.  You are right, anything can happen, but it would be like me saying ""there is speculation that Donovan Mitchell will re-injure himself this year.""  It's baseless, and thus pointless.   The people who actually have ANY knowledge of the situation ALL say he should be back this year.  Without any doubt.  Random dudes with zero insight saying something isn't evidence of anything."
If you told me in 2018 that either Ben Simmons or Donovan Mitchell would turn out to be a one-dimensional disappointment who fell off after his first season and forced his way off his team... even as a Jazz fan I would've guessed Mitchell. I knew there was a chance he was Tyreke Evans II. But the opposite happened.
Donovan Mitchell is comfortably better then Jamal Murray. Donovan plays respectable defense too
I like Donovan Mitchell
"Donovan Mitchell is 24 years old. How many guys were the best player on a championship team by the time they were his age? The list is probably pretty short. Let's look at the last few #1 guys and their ages.  2020: LeBron - 36  2019: Kawhi - 28  2018: KD - 30  2017: KD - 29   2016: Lebron - 32  2015: Steph - 27  2014: Kawhi - 22  2013: Lebron - 29  2012: Lebron - 28  2011: Dirk - 33  2010: Kobe - 31  2009: Kobe - 30  2008: Paul Pierce - 31  2007: Tim Duncan - 31  2006: DWade - 24  2005: Tim Duncan - 29  2004: Chauncey - 28  2003: Tim Duncan - 27  2002: Shaq - 30  2001: Shaq - 29  2000: Shaq - 28  So we have one guy who was Mitchell's same age; that's D Wade. We also had Kawhi, who was two years Mitchell's junior. So that's two guys who are younger than Mitchell by the time they are the best player on a championship team. Calling Mitchell second fiddle at his *peak* when the average age for a guy being the best player on a championship contending team is just a hair over 30 years old, when Mitchell is only in his fourth season, and when he's come off the back off an absolutely *historic* playoff series in which his team was missing their second best scorer? Mitchell is *already* good enough to be the second option on a championship contender. And to say that he will never be anything more than he is today, even though he's taken a leap every single year and has been the best player in half of the playoff series he's already played in? That's just insanely premature."
"Even if one of the other guys brought it up it would just be like ‚Äúhey man you just had and amazing game but shaq says you‚Äôll never be a superstar, thoughts?‚Äù No matter who brings it up what should Mitchell say? Idk there‚Äôs no real point in bringing it up after Donovan has lead the Jazz to 7 straight wins to tie for the second in the west."
"It‚Äôs not overrated it‚Äôs a great show, and in Shaq‚Äôs defense he wasn‚Äôt the one that started that Donovan conversation, Kenny did. And all 3 of them basically said the exact same thing about Mitchell. They‚Äôve done this before I just didn‚Äôt understand why the had to call him out while his team is on a 7 game win streak and 2nd in the West."
In what world is Shaq a washed up media personality? Seriously. Shaq is literally more famous than Donovan Mitchell. And not because he was a better player. Shaq as a media personality is more famous than Donovan Mitchell.
My heart says Donovan Mitchell but my brain says probably LeBron or Embiid
historically. have you heard how kobe used to motivate teammates? phil jackson? that was commonplace in the 80s/90s. if you need evidence look at how the halftime team jumps to defend Gobert from clear malicious disrespect and how no one responded to defend Mitchell...because it was clear to everyone involved that he admires Donovan.
"I got no hate for Donovan but he‚Äôs not a superstar. There are only like 5 superstars in the league. Curry, LBJ, KD, Kawhi, Harden. Mitchell isn‚Äôt on that level."
"Imagine clowning Donovan Mitchell and Christian Wood. Two of the most hardworking and humble guys in the league. Some of the others are up for criticism, but he took it too far."
See he is a sixers fan so he can‚Äôt acknowledge Donovan Mitchell exists let alone is good at basketball.
"Kawhi... interesting that you bring up Kawhi.  Mitchell is averaging 1 point, 1 rebound and 1 assist less than Kawhi. So is Kawhi only a star? Or is he Donovan Mitchell who had great teams around him that allowed him to make the next step?"
"Why are you being so condescending hahaha  Let‚Äôs look at James Hard and Stephen Curry. Both are the system and are superstars. Kawhi Leonard‚Äî superstar and trancends a system that revolves around him.   Damian Lillard‚Äî superstar? I think so. Plays within a system that allows him to go off. I can see why people would argue against it.   Donovan Mitchell is a star and not a superstar. Rudy Gobert being the focus of their system has produced him individual awards and no real post season success. Good defensive player, not a superstar."
I watch a lot of Jazz game as I really like Donovan Mitchell but it sucks when your game time usually overlaps with Warriors game. Looking forward to the Saturday game
"Donovan ""Shaq's favorite player tonight"" Mitchell"
Donovan Mitchell for the most part
"Youre stopping half way through. He says ""I wanted you to hear it"" after Donovan says ""aight"", Mitchell continues to say people have said that all my life and he uses it for motivation and Shaq says ""thats what I wanted to hear you say"""
"Just last week Gobert and Harden voiced their frustration with Shaq's comments. Where's this idea that suddenly people don't care come from. Mitchell literally went on to say he's used those comments for motivation his entire life and Shaq finishes with ""thats what I wanted to hear""  Like I said, you can think thats stupid but Mitchell knew what it was and the rest of the studio knew what it was. Thats why no one is telling him to leave Donovan alone, because it was clear he admires him. He does not like Gobert which is why they're continuing to defend him."
So disrespectful man. Donovan Mitchell just wanna celebrate and this is what shaq brings up? Clown
"Lmao what did Mitchell average in the playoffs last season? How many years into his career?  And Shaq isn't exactly known for his eye for talent. Donovan handled that the best way possible, no petty shit tryna defend himself, let shaq gas out, look dumb, and said he was gonna continue to do his thing cause it fuckin works"
"No, it sounds more like you only have listened to Shaq through the vantage point of his takes on Utah. Shaq as a player has talked about the importance about rising to such challenges and needing them as motivation. Shaq probably hates Utah, Donovan isn't Utah though. Donovan is a player that grew in an area close to Shaq that has dominated in way that Shaq respects and he says as much. Shaq isn't beginning an interview with Gobert saying ""youre one of my favorite players"" cause that's not true. He's doing that with Mitchell because he means it and wants to help him develop. You can think thats stupid, but thats what it is."
"Donovan Mitchell is the perfect representative of this team in every way. We are very lucky to have him. He is mature beyond his years, handles himself with class, he's easy on the eyes and most importantly, an absolute beast on the court."
We can agree to disagree. I do not think Donovan Mitchell is a good defender at this point in time
I think he expected Donovan to really care about what he said and say that he was putting in work to prove him wrong. Like he‚Äôs some legend that Mitchell should bow down to. I doubt Mitchell cares at all about what Shaq thinks.
I think Ben is in a slump or still injured tbh so if it‚Äôs just based on this year its Donovan   But every other season Ben has been unarguably better than Mitchell imo so I‚Äôd expect him to be that again in the future
Chuck is completely right. Not enough people in the media really wanna criticize players. It‚Äôs easy to talk shit about Kyrie or criticize a superstar like Harden or Russ but not as many will offer constructive criticism of likable upcoming guys.   Donovan Mitchell only having one double digit assist game and one double digit rebounding game straight up isn‚Äôt good enough. I agree that he‚Äôs got to find ways to impact the game in other ways if he wants to keep improving
Had to validate himself after the shitty halftime take. Donovan came out and showed up and Shaq wanted to make it like he‚Äôs trying to motivate when really he was just hating on Mitchell at halftime.
"honestly, they're only quiet because the league has no idea how to market teams. utah has a two time DPOY and donovan mitchell, with scoring machine clarkson coming off the bench, and the first national game they get this season is because of zion?"
Donovan ‚ÄúShaq was wrong about Donovan Mitchell‚Äù Mitchell
"Donovan ""aight"" Mitchell"
"Donovan ""aight"" Mitchell"
"[Man, Shaq and Chuck were right. I can't think of anything that Donovan Mitchell can do outside of scoring. Nope, not a thing.](https://streamable.com/m9b2y8)"
Donovan ‚Äú3rd option‚Äù Mitchell
"Donovan ""One Dimensional"" Mitchell with 36/7/5"
"Donovan ""Aight"" Mitchell"
Donovan Mitchell wins and they immediately are rude as shit to him and ruin the interview????
Who the fuck is a diet donovan mitchell?
"Donovan ""3rd option"" Mitchell"
donovan mitchell
I love Donovan Mitchell
Pretty sure every season high Donovan Mitchell has had in points has been against us btw.
"Donovan ""third option"" Mitchell..... -_-"
Yo r/nba (non jazz flairs please) is Donovan Mitchell a first option.   Trying to settle something
Donovan Mitchell looks pretty great too. Guy seems totally unruffled at all times and is a straight up killer.
"I can't believe there are still people that watch Donovan Mitchell play and they're like ""nah give me Fred VanVleet"" or some shit"
A roleplayer who plays like Donovan Mitchell.
Donovan Mitchell
Donovan Mitchell a fucking stud
Donovan Mitchell turns into a literal god against us every single time no exceptions.
"Man it's great seeing future Lakers Donovan Mitchell and Zion Williamson out there, love to see it"
Donovan mitchell already got his signature shoes couple years ago iirc
I think Sexton is more of a Donovan Mitchell/Jamal Murray type which isn‚Äôt a bad thing at all
"I wouldn't pick 76ers because back in the 2017-2018 season Ben Simmons who's a star player in 76ers stole Donovan Mitchell's Rookie Of The Year Award. He wasn‚Äôt even from 2017-2018 class.   Support the team you like, don't look at the winning streak, rings etc. I became a Jazz fan in 2017 because of Mitchell and after couple months  I started to like the team in general, Jazz's history and other Jazz players etc. Now I won't change the team I support even if we start playing like Wizards or Knicks)."
I love Donovan Mitchell
"So isn‚Äôt Donovan Mitchell from Connecticut?? If so, he‚Äôs gotta be better than Kris Dunn."
Uhhhh Donovan Mitchell was born in Connecticut and you have Kris Dunn listed as the best active player from there.
Man. Is it not exhausting dedicating your time on reddit on bashing our team? Donovan Mitchell had a rough first half of his rookie season and then he lit it up so I'm not giving up on a rookie after 10 games which he played without KAT on a team in turmoil.
Donovan Mitchell might‚Äôve been born in New York but he grew up/went to school in CT
"&gt; AD is demonstrably better than Cleveland Kyrie, let‚Äôs not try to make that argument. 2016 Lebron was the carry job of the century, Lebron-AD is not a Batman-Robin duo, they‚Äôre a 1A-1B.  That's not the argument I was making.  I'm laughing about these phrases people attach to players that have nothing to do with the player and everything to do with their situation. I bet you used to call Donovan Mitchell a winning player and Devin Booker an empty stats guy too, huh?   &gt; The Harden Rockets were a failed experiment.  Ha again, such a simplistic view.  THe Rockest took arguably the greatest team to ever exist to 7, and were a CP3 injury away from likely beating them. The only thing separating James Harden from finals appearances was the conference he played in."
"Seeing that Donovan Mitchell highlight got me watching old Dwade highlights, and I forgot just how dominant this dude was. It's crazy how he had no real jumpshot, but was still able to get to the rim whenever he wanted too. The closest comparison I can think of is Jimmy Butler with Westbrook's athleticism. If you got some time, check out some Wade highlights."
It‚Äôs literally just Kyrie  If that happened to Myles Turner or Donovan Mitchell the reactions would be different
"Lmao how many times have you asked this already? The team isnt good, Wiggins is the second option ffs. This isnt like Harden who had CP3 with him, or Westbrook who had Paul George.  And also the reason why Curry isnt criticized to the extent Harden and Westbrook did is because Curry has already won it all in 2015. Yeah there were injuries in the Finals but he was still able to lead his team to that point in the first place and beat LeBron fucking James. Not a lot of people can say that.  Unlike Harden, who was unable to beat the Curry-led Warriors in 2019 when KD went down (series was tied 2-2 when KD went down), or Westbrook who had PG with him and couldn‚Äôt beat rookie Donovan Mitchell.  Seems like you‚Äôre pushing hard for this sub to hate Steph Curry."
"Donovan Mitchell: Wouldn't have said this in the beginning of the season, but he's bounced back  Ja: Might be the best guard in the league in a few years  Jamal: I was so sure he'd be an All-NBA caliber player after the Playoffs, so I'm disappointed  Trae: Not making the jump I thought he'd have, but still young and could still be the next best guard after Ja in a few years"

Fuck I love Donovan Mitchell.
"His first two games before KAT were out he looked solid.  Game one: 10pts, 10reb, 2ast, and shot 4/5 from the line and 0-1 on 3's. Played 20minutes and was a big part of the defense that night.   Game two: 14pts, 6reb, 1stl and shot 1/2 on free throws and 3-3 on 3's. Big part of Donovan Mitchell playing poorly.   KAT goes out and we go on the loss streak. His confidence gets shook and now we see where he sits. If he realizes he belongs in this league his ceiling is close to like 16-6-3-2-1 on decent percentage as he only has to hit open looks off KAT and D'lo demanding attention."
holy shit Donovan Mitchell
"Zion had one game of 17 minutes because he was in foul trouble the whole time.  Remove that game and he's at 33.8 minutes per game, which is up around the level of Donovan Mitchell, Ben Simmons, Trae Young, Jaylen Brown.  He's playing exactly as much as you'd expect him to."
Mike Conley and Donovan Mitchell are the most handsome back court in the NBA and it's not even close
"Bro PLEASE ENOUGH OF JASON TATUM! The guy is a decent player, sure. He‚Äôs not in the same stratosphere as KD or Harden. He‚Äôs Donovan Mitchell in the East. Good player, won‚Äôt challenge for a title."
"Donovan ""Spida"" Mitchell would like a word with you."
"On the topic of fanbases, my team lost to the Knicks when they were above 0.5 and the comments on the jazz tweet were like ""Donovan Mitchell needs to leave Utah."" You deserve to lose if you talk like that imo."
"Real picks: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Damian Lillard, Anthony Davis   Edgy picks: Donovan Mitchell, Ben Simmons, Jamal Murray"
"looool the same can be said for Jokic and Donovan Mitchell. The media outright ignores them so often.  Of the smaller markets, the media only seems to acknowledge Dame and Giannis."
"Paul George is an MVP candidate type of player, no one else on that list is close to that. I think Booker is the best of the rest, while the other 3 are all similar and can be swapped in any order.  1. Paul George  2. Devin Booker  3. Ben Simmons  4. Jaylen Brown  5. Donovan Mitchell"
Paul George  Devin Booker  Donovan Mitchell  JB  Ben Simmons
"I can‚Äôt put Donovan Mitchell, Chris Paul, Karl Anthony Towns or Devin Booker above him. His numbers have been better than all of them this season, and he just came off a impressive playoff run, so it‚Äôs probably sustainable"
"Sophomore wall happens to everybody. Look at Donovan Mitchell, his sophomore year he hit a massive slump, as did many others. Offenses and defenses adjust over time, and offenses adapted to get around Jaren. You can't really compare KAT to Jaren though, KAT is a traditional big man in the sense that he's flatfooted and solid, whilst Jaren is quicker, but also weaker. Jaren's type of defense transfers better to the league, and as the video, I feel, adequately pointed out, Jaren's fouls and rebounding should cut back once he fully grows into NBA form, stronger and more planted. It is inadequate to compare Jaren to Steve Novak and Andrea Bargnani, as neither player was as strong or assertive on the interior, or the defensive end. Ron Artest, Draymond and Tyson Chandler all had comparable foul rates, and each got a DPOY, and with the physical gifts and IQ that Jaren already has, I think it's far less likely for him to be projected as a Novak / Bargnani type, and more as a mobile defensive big, that hasn't really been seen before."

donovan mitchell does not throw his butt out into defenders to bait fouls. he just doesn‚Äôt. what is this take?
No idea why donovan mitchell doesnt get criticized for this more. dude either gets to the top of the paint and backs into his guy or throws down the same one hand tomahawk slam that he always does. and I'm a fan of his
"Yeah I don't think it is going to end up a bad class. But there was no Anthony Davis, Karl Towns, Zion Williamson... clear #1 pick. For my own sake I hope Ant can be a Donovan Mitchell type one day, but that remains to be seen."
**Eastern Conference:**   STARTERS:  G - James Harden  G - Kyrie Irving  FC - Giannis Antetokounmpo  FC - Kevin Durant  FC - Joel Embiid  BENCH:  G - Trae Young  G - Bradley Beal  F - Jayson Tatum  F - Jaylen Brown  F - Khris Middleton  WC: Zach Lavine  WC: Domantas Sabonis  **Western Conference:**   STARTERS:   G - Luka Doncic  G - Stephen Curry  FC - Lebron James  FC - Kawhi Leonard  FC - Anthony Davis  BENCH:   G - Damian Lillard  G - Devin Booker  FC - Paul George  FC - Nikola Jokic  FC - Zion Williamson  WC: Donovan Mitchell  WC: CJ McCollum  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  This is what I'm predicting to happen though I think KAT and Ingram both will deserve it over couple of the people mentioned
What about when he lost to rookie Donovan Mitchell and Dame without Nurk?
Is Donovan Mitchell injured? 7-20 and 0-7 threes?
"&gt;	How high somebody jumps and how quick they move has zero to do with how athletic the people around them are.  I mean, it absolutely affects their ability to take advantage of their quickness/vertical lol. You‚Äôre not making the same plays against AD that you would‚Äôve made against Boston College Power Forward Jimmy Smith.   &gt;	He has barely even jumped off one foot in the NBA whereas he did it all the time in college.  This is kind of a weird thing to point out. One-foot-jumps usually come in transition when there‚Äôs momentum. Zion gets less transition looks because he has less transition opportunities against NBA players. Watch his highlights, he goes off 2 feet 90% of the time, and that 10% is when he‚Äôs completely wide open.   &gt;	If you just watch him by himself, completely alone on a fast break dunk opportunity, he is very obviously not as explosive as he was in college.  He‚Äôs barely gotten *any* fast break dunk opportunities. Most of his fast break dunks come from full court passes from Lonzo. He doesn‚Äôt have the same opportunity he had in college to leak out and cherry pick.   &gt;	I don‚Äôt understand why everyone is in such a rush to explain away a very simple eye test.  The eye test is almost *always* going to prove that a player isn‚Äôt as dominant in the NBA as they were in college. That‚Äôs kinda the point...  &gt;	Did Russell Westbrook, Derrick Rose, Dwyane Wade, or Donovan Mitchell look less athletic in the NBA? No; because they were just as athletic (or more) in the nba. Zion simply is not...  You just named a few explosive *guards* who can still play exactly how they played in HS/college regardless of what kind of defense they face. PFs and Cs notoriously have it harder at the next level, because facing a 7‚Äô0 brick wall in the NBA is a much bigger step-up from college than facing a 6‚Äô5 guard instead of a 6‚Äô2 guard.   Zion averaged 22/9 in college. He‚Äôs currently averaging 22/7 in the NBA. He‚Äôs adjusting fine, and the ‚Äúeye-test‚Äù bullshit only works if you don‚Äôt account for literally every difference between college and the NBA."
"I don't think very many people have ever tried to argue that the bubble had **no** effect on players or outcomes. In fact, I'm pretty sure I could play around on google and find plenty of posts, tweets, and articles with plenty to say about how the bubble changed things dramatically.  We're talking a months-long stoppage of play as the pandemic developed, an overall shorter season in terms of the number of games, the brand-new play-in system, home-court advantage fully being made irrelevant, travel considerations being eliminated, teams and players being put on lookout for violating safety protocol, etc etc etc not to mention the heavy mental load that all of the above and more can put on a person's mind. Any one of these things can explain certain things you mention in your post if not all of them. Undoubtedly it at the very least had a pretty big impact on the playoff picture just in terms of seeding  All of that being said, here's a bunch of things that can happen at any given NBA season, and we've seen happen plenty of times outside of any bubble situation:  *Star players fall short of expectations and have short-sighted nephews call them scrubs repeatedly over the summer (arguably this wasn't even the first time either Giannis or Paul George has had this happen to them)  *Teams don't live up to their regular season expectations and fall to lower-seeded teams that managed to capitalize on advantageous matchups (my own Grizzlies kickstarted their Grit n Grind era knocking off the top-seeded Spurs in the first round about a decade ago)  *Shooters in general experience some streakiness in general because of either matchup-related reasons or just regular statistical noise  *Donovan Mitchell being an All-Star prior to the bubble  *The Heat hardly being God-Slayers before the bubble (12 games behind 1st in the East, 9 behind 2nd) and going 3-4 in the bubble"
"This is such a lazy take. How high somebody jumps and how quick they move has zero to do with how athletic the people around them are. He has barely even jumped off one foot in the NBA whereas he did it all the time in college. Sure, he will look less athletic in comparison to NBA players and won‚Äôt be able to get away with as much, but he also has been noticeably heavier and stiffer. If you just watch him by himself, completely alone on a fast break dunk opportunity, he is very obviously not as explosive as he was in college.   I don‚Äôt understand why everyone is in such a rush to explain away a very simple eye test. Did Russell Westbrook, Derrick Rose, Dwyane Wade, or Donovan Mitchell look less athletic in the NBA? No; because they were just as athletic (or more) in the nba. Zion simply is not..."
"So you think   1) Rondo making exactly 2 more 3's than his career average would indicate over the course of a playoffs  and  2) Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell, neither of whom have ever shot 38% in a season, made a combined 65 3's in a single series, and shot 52%.  Both of those guys in one series shot better than Curry ever has, Klay ever has, Durant, Dame, Harden, and the list goes on and on.    are comparable in how unlikley they were? Really? That's crazy to me.   &gt; every year u have someone massively over performing   Every year you don't have two good-not-great shooters have the 1st and 2nd best shooting series in NBA history in the same series"
I remember rookie Donovan Mitchell had 22 points on 8/8 shooting through the first 10 minutes of the 3rd quarter in game 6 against OKC but he missed a heave at the buzzer that ruined the perfect accuracy.
Donovan Mitchell
Sorry but this isn‚Äôt a great statement. Maybe Simmons hasn‚Äôt improved but Donovan just averaged 36 points and nearly 5 AST while shooting 52% in a 7 game playoff series. Jazz didn‚Äôt lose that series because of Mitchell.
"That‚Äôs... what they got him for. They were losing to the Rockets not because they couldn‚Äôt stop the Rockets, it was because they couldn‚Äôt score. They pretty much just had a pre-breakout Donovan Mitchell. Having a top defense clearly wasn‚Äôt enough."
Lmao I‚Äôm a big Donovan Mitchell fan. Mostly fan of specific players for fantasy
"LeBron   AD  KD  Harden  Jokic  Doncic  Curry  Lillard  Embiid  Giannis  Tatum  Beal  Butler  Kawhi  Paul George  Could probably make the argument that Donovan Mitchell, Gobert, Ben Simmons, Sabonis and Vucevic have been more valuable than him too."
Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert
"Dude got his shit rocked by rookie Donovan Mitchell and Joe Ingles, he‚Äôs gotta earn that respect because I sure as hell ain‚Äôt gonna give it to him rn"
"The sheer number of talented, productive guards in the West right now is insane. Understanding that SGA is the clear alpha on a team tanking (well, supposed to be tanking LOL), you have production lines that are right up there with the guys most would have penciled in to be All Stars at the start of the season.   Unless I missed a change to All Star lineups, at MOST the West can name 6 backcourt players to the roster. It's going to be a travesty that a minimum of THREE of these guys are going to be snubbed this year:  Steph Curry Damian Lillard Luka Doncic Devin Booker Chris Paul Donovan Mitchell Shai Gilgeous-Alexander CJ McCollum Mike Conley"
"I would love to see him win it. Every time Donovan Mitchell faces him he completely takes him out of what he wants to do. It feels like screens do nothing to Dort.  Obviously, I'd love to see Rudy win another one, and he's been great, but Dort changes games in a very different and interesting way, especially given how many teams are playing outside-in these days."
"Mitchell is averaging more assists, more rebounds, more wins. Booker has a better TS%, but that's the only thing he's ""having a better"" season than Donovan on."
"No Gobert is mid tier, Donovan is low tier. Booker who was an injury replacement and SGA who didn't even make the team are having better individual seasons than Mitchell"
No order btw  1. LeBron James 2. Kawhi Leonard 3. Anthony Davis 4. James Harden 5. Kevin Durant 6. Stephen Curry 7. Kyrie Irving 8. Paul  George 9. Damian Lillard 10. Joel Embiid 11. Nikola Jokic 12. Luka Doncic 13. Zion Williamson (yes that's right) 14. Chris Paul 15. Giannis  16. Rudy Gobert 17. Donovan Mitchell 18. Jimmy Butler 19. Jaylen Brown 20. Ben Simmons  maybe a healthy KP top 25
"What do 5 man lineups have to do with lineups combos with a player **off** the court.   Show me where on BBRef I can quickly find the Jazz point differential with Rudy Gobert on the court and Donovan Mitchell on the **bench**, regardless of the other 4 guys on the court."
Did Steve Kerr coach Donovan Mitchell during his first few years in the league? Was Steve Kerr the UTA coach when they got Rudy Gobert? Is the Warriors the only team to have swept the Jazz during the regular season?
Donovan Mitchell tho
And look at Donovan Mitchell in the clutch... all the way at the bottom. Which is interesting since he plays next to Gobert and Conley. But from r/NBA you‚Äôd swear he could carry a trash roster all the way to the 8th seed doing that poorly.
Does leading an offense necessarily make you better though? Like AD and Klay aren‚Äôt exactly star playmakers but I‚Äôd still take them over guys like Donovan Mitchell without a second thought.
Which moron outside of Utah thinks Donovan Mitchell is better than Devin Booker?
"Yes, Donovan Mitchell has been marginally more efficient (.02%) than Tatum has been in the last 30 games.   Tatums been more efficient every season, as well as for every game.   If you want to fight that go ahead, but saying Tatum is more efficient really shouldn‚Äôt bother you that much considering that‚Äôs been true for basically every part of their careers."
Because he doesn't watch bulls games so he doesn't know the bulls dont have a real point guard and have a significantly younger and worse roster than the jazz so therefore donovan mitchell is better.
"I don't know if you can say Mitchell is better than Beal, but there is no way the Jazz do this, Donovan is to beloved in Utah"
"I totally get that thinking, I land somewhere a little more in the middle. Scoring and offensive creation is the most valuable skillset without a doubt, but it doesn‚Äôt necessarily necessitate star-level impact, and I think overall impact is more important.  Donovan Mitchell looks and plays way more like what we know a star to be, yet Gobert‚Äôs consistently been a notably more impactful player than him, and more vital to their success. I don‚Äôt even like Gobert that much, but if you have star-level impact on the game, I‚Äôm okay with calling you a star. I think better examples of this discussion are maybe guys like Draymond and Simmons, guys that are dominant defenders that also totally control the flow of their offenses. I understand Gobert does that to a degree with his screening, but I also definitely have hang ups with the idea of Gobert as a ‚Äústar‚Äù due to his offensive role and limitations.  Scoring at an elite level is far more likely to make you a star than defending at an elite level, but scoring is also a role than can be fulfilled by ‚Äúrole players‚Äù if your ‚Äústar‚Äù fulfills so many other things."
Donovan Mitchell makes it look so easy. Been playing so well. And these young guns could not score on Gobert hahaha
"Maybe not the best ever, but Donovan Mitchell has 0."
"The Basketball Reference MVP Tracker, which is modeled on past voter patterns, has Gobert at number seven, ahead of teammate Donovan Mitchell.    Ever since they created the DPoY award, defensive specialists just don't get considered for MVP.  Bill Russell was the last defensive specialist to win MVP, and probably will remain so. Ben Wallace probably should have at least been in the top five a couple of times, but the closest he came was a distant seventh. Joakim Noah was fourth in MVP voting in 2014, the same year he won DPoY.  But Noah also averaged 5.4 assists per game that year, operating as a kind of point center.  I'm afraid the best Gobert can hope for is fourth, and he'll more likely finish outside of the top five, as Basketball Reference predicts."
This is the Donovan Mitchell the Jazz are going to need if they want to make a run at a championship.
"Tough to say. Of the 6 guards on the team (im assuming he won‚Äôt qualify as a SF at all), harden, beal, Steph, Dame should all be 100% locks. The other 2 spots have plenty of competition: Lavine, Kyrie (if he doesn‚Äôt miss too many more games), doncic (assuming he‚Äôs considered a guard for this purpose), Donovan Mitchell (I consider him behind lavine but could be in convo), Russ (if he doesn‚Äôt miss many more games) and a few other guys that I‚Äôm probably forgetting.   Lavine has a strong case but lot of completion at the guard spots. I would probably slot him in as a third teamer (especially if they make playoffs) but it‚Äôs certainly no guarantee with the insane amount of quality guards in league."
"Unlike Gobert, Bill was the finals MVPs on those teams. So you can‚Äôt compare the two. Gobert has literally been benched in the playoffs because that improved Utah‚Äôs odds of winning those games. That would never happen to Russell.   Again regular season is pointless when talking about what it means for players legacies. Why do media heads go around looking like fools proclaiming the Utah Jazz as the team to beat when we all know they‚Äôre getting their ass wooped in the 2nd round? They spent so much time hyping up the raptors in 2018 for being the first seed and talking shit about Lebron and saying he doesnt want to win all year because he had a dogshit roster without kyrie and Kevin love underperforming and he wanted to add more pieces until he swept that overrated ass team without even trying. I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôd take Westbrook over Mitchell and I‚Äôm not saying shaq is super well informed but his mentality is that he‚Äôs taking guys who have performed well in the playoffs over reg season sensations. Imo it doesn‚Äôt apply to Donovan vs Westbrook because Donovan actually performs really well in the playoffs but it‚Äôs the same reason why the media keeps gassing up Giannis (and Embiid this year) just to see them get their ass beat by players who know what the reg season is for."
"You just named 3 guys who are well ahead of him. That‚Äôs not counting Donovan Mitchell, Book, Dame, Kawhi &amp; PG who are well ahead of Randle if we want to extrapolate the conversation. Heck Tobias Harris is ahead of him if we want to go that far.  I know you guys are excited and all but the Knicks are like 2 games above .500. Nobody is giving you an MVP for that."

I want to say Bradley beal but that doesn't feel right beal is a better passer and I want to say Donovan Mitchell but Ray never had the handle like Mitchell although he could take you off the dribble.   My answer would be Bradley Beal
I'd say Donovan Mitchell

"Davion Mitchell shares a similar name, same number, similar build, and similar play style to Donovan Mitchell. He ate a big, athletic Nova team alive last night."
Donovan Mitchell was scoring like 50 points in some games last playoffs. He and Conley plus Bogdanovic can explode any time.
Star players win championships. Is Donovan Mitchell really good enough to win a title for his team as the best player?
"I mean I‚Äôm sorry but if we‚Äôre talking about Jazz making the Finals I just can‚Äôt see it happening. They could definitely get to the WCF, but if they run into the Lakers they‚Äôre gonna struggle to win without a superstar on their team. In close games they‚Äôre gonna have to rely on Donovan Mitchell who is good but not that consistent."
"I don‚Äôt think he dislikes anyone. Even with Donovan Mitchell or Gobert, he‚Äôs called them really good players, he just doesn‚Äôt think they‚Äôre worth the hype they‚Äôre getting right now. It‚Äôs also a way of ‚Äúprove me wrong‚Äù talk which was common place in the 90s. Honestly the response to shaq for saying what he‚Äôs said undeniably does prove his point about this generation being soft."
"Donovan Mitchell is not good enough to build around unless you're moronic enough to believe that last postseason was anything but an aberration. He's a high volume, mediocre efficiency scorer without extraordinary passing ability. They're much better off sticking with the Gobert/Mitchell pair together than letting Gobert go and signing what would probably just be role players."
Donovan mitchell. I understand he's still young but whenever he faced Houston he stunk up the joint. Maybe this year will be the year he gets past the 2nd rd.
"Booker and Tatum are the young players that are in that ""these guys are REALLY good"" but not quite ""full blown superstars"" category. It's a distinct milestone in a players development I think so it creates a group of players that are bound to be compared. I'd say Donovan Mitchell is in that category too, with Fox and maybe Jamal Murray in their too.   This is not to say all these players are equal, but they're in the same broad skill-level category I'd say."
Well 1) Donovan Mitchell in the last 20 seconds of the 4th quarter in game 7. 2) PG13 in recent times. 3) Damiam Lillard.
"Yes.   If you ask this of Ja Morant, people would say yes. And he is BETTER than Ja. Bc Ja can‚Äôt shoot.   I already know how this will go. Kings will get into the playoffs in a year or two, and Fox will absolutely show out ala Donovan Mitchell. And then people will rush in all late ans then give him praise"

Kyrie is in that first group sorry. Averaging  damn near 30 5 6. And he‚Äôs definitely bettter than Gobert idek how that‚Äôs a question üòÇ. Jimmy is far more important to the hest than Gobert is to the Jazz and that‚Äôs saying something. Donovan  Mitchell is the best player on the Jazz and it‚Äôs not even debatable.
"What else do you want to judge it on, because based on eye test as well Mitchell is a great playmaker? The Suns have Booker and Paul as ball handlers, the Jazz switch off between Ingles, Conley, Clarkson, and Mitchell. Donovan isn‚Äôt the main guy that brings the ball up."
"Yes, I can blame you because before that series no one thought Murray was anywhere close to as good as Mitchell. Murray has never averaged 20 ppg until this season, Donovan has been doing it his whole career."
"He‚Äôs okay, but he‚Äôs still a better than Booker. Mitchell has a longer wingspan than Booker, and that‚Äôs super important for defenders to have long arms. Donovan Mitchell has been a lot better at playmaking this year, and his assist/to ratio is 1.9 compared to Booker‚Äôs 1.4."
"Donovan Mitchell isn‚Äôt a bad defender he‚Äôs been better than Booker in that aspect every year. He‚Äôs also been a better playmaker than Booker this year by a fair amount. He may be small, but he makes up for it with his strength, 6‚Äô 10‚Äù wingspan, and 40‚Äù vertical."
"I mean I get team record plays some part of a factor but I feel like advanced stats are a better way to compare two individual players on two completely different teams. VORP: 1.7 for Mitchell, 1.9 for Tatum. BPM is 2.8 for Mitchell and 3.3 for Tatum. RAPTOR is +2.5 for Mitchell and +3.3 for Tatum. These advanced stats and their regular stats that you pointed out are very similar. Tatum even has 1 all NBA team to Donovan‚Äôs 0. I think it‚Äôs pretty crazy to think Tatum and Donovan aren‚Äôt on that same tier of player and that both have cases for being the better player."

I think Donovan Mitchell should at least be mentioned even as an outside chance. He's as close to a first option on this Jazz team as anyone could be. I think these playoffs will be a great litmus test as to whether he can carru that burden.
Donovan Mitchell is actually averaging 31.5 in the same time frame. But yes Fox is smoking hot right now.
"""Is Donovan Mitchell working his way into MVP discussion yet?""  No"
&gt;Is Donovan Mitchell working his way into MVP discussion yet?  Lol what?
"donovan mitchell had an unbelievable night, could have gone for 50 if it was necessary  ja‚Äôs dunk was unreal  fun game!"
Donovan Mitchell comin for that MVP conversation
"Yeah everyone says Gobert gets played off the court but the only year he averaged less than 30 MPG in the playoffs was his first year in it when he only played 10 seconds before spraining his knee against the Clippers. That was the year that Curry made him a shooting star meme so everyone kind of just gathers their opinion off that  In his playoff career, he has a net rating of +18 per 100 possessions, which is higher than pretty much every superstar in the league today (Harden +11, LeBron +14, Giannis +10, Embiid +3, Dame +6, Jokic +15, Durant +12, Curry +11, CP3 +15, Paul George +7). Kawhi and Anthony Davis are the only other top players I can find in this search with a +18 per 100 in the postseason. The Jazz just never had the offense to keep up with Houston, and then last year they didn't have a reliable backup behind Rudy.  Rudy didn't get played off the floor, Tony Bradley did lol  For what it's worth, Donovan Mitchell is -7 per 100 possessions in the Playoffs. He did play a lot with the 2nd unit in those Rockets games, though. We were desperate for scoring"
"This man is saying this while literally having a Donovan Mitchell tag, you know he‚Äôs speaking facts"
Donovan fucking Mitchell everybody
That's true. And he is also balling SO FUCKING HARD that his name should be in headlines.  Unfortunately he is on a roster that Includes Donovan Mitchell
... I literally listed the Bucks as a team that made a major fuck up. You can point to a bunch of mistakes those other teams made too. Nuggets traded Donovan Mitchell for Trey Lyles and Tyler Lydon. Traded Beasley despite him going off when he got starter minutes and being an extremely athletic lights out shooter. Blazers traded up for Zach Collins who's mediocre at best when he's actually healthy instead of staying back and being able to draft OG Anunoby and John Collins (both high upside players who were projected as good picks). Jazz are building around Mitchell/Gobert as their core which isn't their fault but also just not good enough to win a championship.
It‚Äôs really hard for me to have anything but respect for Donovan Mitchell but come on dude chill the fuck out.
You had people like Donovan Mitchell nearly dropping 60 points. That proves how mickey mouse it was
"Yea I mean I look at that WCF and see it as somewhat impressive, but really who did they beat? They beat a completely dysfunctional thunder team who‚Äôs best player was playing with 2 bad shoulders and had just lost to rookie Donovan Mitchell the year before. They then win a nice 7 game series against a really young nuggets team who was still figuring things out and who wouldn‚Äôt break out for another year. And finally they get swept by the KD warriors without KD. Getting to the WCF is always an achievement to be proud of, but when you really look at who they beat, I wouldn‚Äôt say they beat any contenders. They had a shot to beat a contender when they faced the warriors without their best player, and they ended up blowing 3 double digit leads on the way to getting swept. That‚Äôs why I would consider them, alongside the pacers, in purgatory."
Donovan Mitchell.
Kawhi was probably in the 2013 finals  Donovan Mitchell was the playoff series against the Thunder  Booker is obviously the 70 point game
"Well the normal starters for Utah are Mitchell (~~yes, drafted by the Jazz~~), Rudy (yes), Conley (no), Bojan (no), and O'Neale (undrafted). So only 2/5  E: wait no Donovan was technically drafted by Denver"
His name is Donovan Mitchell
"1. Luka Doncic 2. Zion Williamson 3. LaMelo Ball 4. Donovan Mitchell 5. Jayson Tatum 6. De‚ÄôAaron Fox 7. Ben Simmons 8. Devin Booker 9. Bam Adebayo 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Brandon Ingram 12. Jaylen Brown 13. Jamal Murray 14. Michael Porter Jr. 15. Ja Morant 16. Trae Young  I love Trae, but this list isn't absurd.   There's a few positions I would change but a lot of those guys don't have the physical limitations Trae does.  I do think, just like many others on this list, Trae has HoF potential."
"Man, Donovan Mitchell is playing as well as he did last year. I wish Jamal Murray was healthy so he could duel him again. That shit was epic, I want round 2."
you should watch this game if you want to see donovan mitchell excel at playmaking
"If the mavs beat the clippers, a supposedly great defensive team there is no reason why the jazz are a more dangerous threat. It‚Äôs really just Donovan Mitchell and role players, conleys nice too"
Donovan ‚ÄúThe Spidah‚Äù Mitchell
"Congratulations on the Memphis Grizzlies for advancing to the sec -   wait, what? They did? But I was told they would be a first round exit. No, that can't be right.  It was 4-1? And the loss was game 1 without Donovan Mitchell? And the closeout game was a blowout?"
Donovan Mitchell: he‚Äôs so hot right now.
#DONOVAN MITCHELL
   Mhm I am starting to think this Jazz team might be better with Donovan Mitchell.
"Because Donovan Mitchell would have made those situations so much better üòÇüòÇüòÇ  I guess De'Aaron Fox is just ""terrible"" as the lone star in Sac"
will simp for donovan mitchell
Donovan Mitchell is filthy.
Donovan Mitchell improves to 7-0 against the Grizzlies this season.
"Are you guys watching Donovan Mitchell right now.  He could put 50 on any team, in any game.  Unreal."
Donovan Mitchell happened.
Donovan Mitchell exploded in 1st half. No he is just toying.
Donovan Mitchell
"Rudy Gobert won two DPOY awards and will win his third this year once it‚Äôs announced. Him, Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley all made the all-star team this year. Jordan Clarkson won 6th man of the year this year. Gobert and Mitchell are legit top tier players and now have multiple all star appearances. Mitchell has even won the dunk contest. Conley has been a great player for many years, but was always just barely pushed out of making the all star team. There are also some high level role players on the Jazz such as Bogdanovic and Ingles. In short, they have two (less famous due to small market) stars in Mitchell and Gobert matched with a deep roster filled great role players. I‚Äôm not exactly sure where I‚Äôd rank the two stars, but Gobert is probably the absolute best defensive presence in the league and Mitchell is a top 15 scorer."
Does anyone else remember Donovan Mitchell playing a closeout game with his starting point guard out due to a hamstring?
How am I not surprised [Donovan Mitchell is a big Justin Bieber fan](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bo2xIvWllmy/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)
~~Donovan ‚ÄúDamian Lillard‚Äù Mitchell~~  Damian ‚ÄúDonovan Mitchell‚Äù Lillard
"They have a bunch of pretty good players. Rudy Gobert is going to lock up his third defensive player of the year this year, and Donovan Mitchell has been a very good scorer, he might have a top 10 ceiling. Beyond them, Mike Conley was a pretty good point guard for Memphis forever, and he's... still pretty good this year. Bojan is a good scorer too, and their last starter, Royce O'Neal, is a great three and d guy. Off the bench includes Clarkson and Ingles, who were top two in the six man of the year voting.  Basically, they all gel together super well, and are really deep. Their shooting and ball movement is tremendous, and Gobert locks down the paint."
"Combination of a few things: underrated young stars like Donovan Mitchell, defensive focused players like Rudy Gobert who are never as popular in the media (despite winning multiple defensive player of the year awards), as well as what you said about really meshing together well. A lot of times the star loaded teams don‚Äôt ‚Äútry‚Äù as much during the regular season or end up being injured a good amount of time, like how the nets big 3 who only played 7 games together all regular season, or lebron who infamously takes it slower during the regular season."
"I'd say a little bit of both. Donovan Mitchell is really starting to come into his own (as you can see from that first half) and Mike Conley has been really good these last couple years as well. On the other hand, this is a team that has completely bought into, and works very well with, Quin Snyder's system to become a team that is truly more than the sum of its parts."
"Little bit of both I‚Äôd say. Their best players are Rudy gobert and Donovan Mitchell, who are both all starts but more in the top 15-20 range. Their supporting cast is also excellent, they have the 6moy Jordan Clarkson as well as mike Conley, a borderline all star player"
"Donovan Mitchell is only in his fourth season. Rudy Gobert and Mike Conley don't get the respect they deserve from the national media. I'm surprised you haven't heard of Donovan yet, he's a superstar.  That said, the strength of our team is our team, it's our chemistry that makes us this good"
"Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley and Rudy gobert aren't a bunch of nobodies"
They have the best defensive player in the league having the best defensive season in history and one of the most elite benches in the NBA. Donovan Mitchell is also a top 10 player
Donovan ‚Äò3rd option‚Äô Mitchell
Donovan Mitchell = üêê
Donovan Mitchell is so fun hahahaha I love this
"Donovan ""Damian Lillard"" Mitchell"
i hope conley is alright  &amp;#x200B;  but DONOVAN SPIDAD MITCHELL SAW DAME AND SAID I CAN DO THAT
Ok obviously as a Jazz fan I'm obsessed with Mitchell but *CHRIST* that shot was the first time where I've ever thought he was on par with Tatum in that draft class.  The kid is special.  It's Honestly dumbfounding.  Edit:  Jesus crack-baby Christ it just happened twice.  Donovan getting a statue in the Wasatch Valley mark my words.  WOW
I LOVE YOU DONOVAN MITCHELL
DONOVAN FUCKING MITCHELL
DONOVAN MITCHELL ü§Ø
Donovan Mitchell is clearly just not good at basketball. Jazz should bench him rest of the game for sure.
What's their record against Donovan Mitchell this year?
Donovan Mitchell is going to be an MVP candidate next year
He literally said Donovan Mitchell would never be a superstar to his face and acted like he was trying to motivate him by saying that. He constantly downplays centers for not playing the way a traditional center would. He picks on Rudy Gobert for having a large contract not understanding how important he is to that team. I agree a lot of analysts are pretty bland but that doesn't make Shaq's takes not awful.
I think he could be on the right team. Swap Kyrie and Donovan Mitchell
DONOVAN MITCHELL
Bro Donovan Mitchell is insane
Donovan Mitchell baby
"Eh I mean Shaq can be super awkward at times, like the Donovan Mitchell thing wasn‚Äôt even good when put in context. When the show sticks to the comedy halftime stuff it‚Äôs great but when they get a little more serious then that‚Äôs when it kind of falls apart"
"Donovan Mitchell was noticeably dunking a lot less this year than ever before and when [he was asked about this he said that he was saving his legs for as long as he can, that he doesn't even dunk during warmups anymore which is something he used to do all the time.](https://kslsports.com/453294/donovan-mitchell-slowly-saying-goodbye-to-dunks/?)"
"Great players win games..His game means very little in a loss. Did MJ  get to be the greatest ever by losing games. People the Blazers lost. This performance by Dame will be forgotten just like the 57 points by Donovan Mitchell in last years playoffs in a LOSS has been. It was amazing...But he lost, All credit goes to the Nuggets."
"Donovan Mitchell has, in his short amount of time in the league, consistently raised his game in the playoffs."
"I personally don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd have given Rudy a supermax. I didn‚Äôt like it when they did it but it‚Äôs clearly worked for them since they did a miracle and found Donovan Mitchell at pick 13.  But that‚Äôs the thing: they have other offensive centerpieces and can afford to pay Rudy to just set screens, catch lobs, and defend the rim.  If they miss on Donovan or Conley, do you think they‚Äôre paying Rudy like that? There‚Äôs no way, right?  The Sixers do not, or at least don‚Äôt play like they do. I‚Äôm unusually high on Tobias Harris and think they really haven‚Äôt utilized him enough, and I think this series has shown that a little.   Point being, Ben Simmons can‚Äôt be your 2nd option. And there‚Äôs still some question of how compatible Ben and Embiid are offensively. They‚Äôve obviously been better this year but it still looks to me like Ben is an offensive liability in the postseason, while Embiid is on the floor.   With Embiid likely out I expect a different tact built around Ben and we‚Äôll all feel dumb for a couple days. Or they‚Äôll lose a game or two and Philly fans will demand he be traded."
Yeah - the Clippers have two of the best wings in the league who will feast on both Donovan Mitchell and Royce O'Neale who are pretty undersized.
"Dame last night, Donovan Mitchell last year, Jordan's 63, Zeke on the ankle all come to mind."
sorry but  a loss is never up there among the greatest games..DOnovan Mitchell had 57 last year against the Nugget sin the playoffs. They lost the game. You don't hear people talking about that as one of the greatest games do you.
It happened in last year playoffs too but with Donovan Mitchell scoring 57 on Nuggets and still losing.
Dame literally got last years playoffs Donovan Mitchell Nuggets special.
One that deserves a mention is Donovan Mitchell dropping 57 last year
"So, Memphis should be getting Steph Curry or Donovan Mitchell at some point soon, right?"
"I mean, we said that about Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell when they both had 31 3s IIRC before Game 7 of that series and look how that turned out. Both players went ice cold."
Bubble counts but it's silly to pretend that players shooting in an open gym environment face the same pressure as players playing in front of a screaming crowd  Lot of random players last yr looked like superstars and then regressed hard this year (Not Spida)  Donovan Mitchell is a great player
"While Dame had a better performance, Donovan Mitchell scoring 57 against the Nuggets in a loss was also impressive"
donovan mitchell please take this personally
Donovan Mitchell put up 57/7/9 in an OT Playoff loss to Denver last year
Donovan Mitchell against Denver game 1
My co-worker loves Donovan mitchell and the Jazz but i dont want to support them just because he does so i thought i‚Äôd see the general gist of the other teams lol
"Donovan Mitchell hasn't improved too much since he's came into the league, and he's stopped playing defense since his second season. I don't see it."
Nah Villian Brooks is a side hoe for Utah compared to Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell. They might have the best rivalry in the NBA besides KAT and Embiid
"Gonna be a little bit of a homer here, but for me it's Immanuel Quickley. I think he'll be an All Star and I think it'll be sooner than most people would dream. There's something about the raw confidence and types of shots that he takes, as well as his work ethic and energy that he provided, that screams breakout potential  Other takes:   I think Donovan Mitchell will end up being a top 10 player, he's really young and is an already explosive scorer and a very good defender for his size  Not sure if this counts because he's already a superstar, but I think Kawhi will end up retiring as a top 10 player of all time. He's only 29 and has been doing a good job at maintaining his knees to the point where I wouldn't consider it a concern as long as his teams can get him to the playoffs to unleash playoff Kawhi"
"One of these isn't like the others...umm quick opinions would be-  Conley is the only one who'd be difficult to criticize on that list.  His statistical impact on paper definitely gets watered down- given Utah's style of play, but he's playing at an elite PG level.  MPJ will never not excite, simply because of that talent- but I wouldn't say his game has improved since the playoffs began by any means.  Guess we're all still waiting.  Booker is still a strong net positive in almost every quarter he's played but it would be cool to see him be the Booker that gets rapped about or go into playoff mode hard like say Jamal Murray or Donovan Mitchell did last year.  For a player that's felt excluded from the prime time each postseason you'd expect an uptick at least but it hasn't happened.  Simmons' FT shooting is painful to watch, but at the end of the day he's playing well.  I don't understand how players with every resource available can't crack 70% FT percentages when struggling college kids can in half a season, but he's honestly good enough it might not matter for Philly so long as Embiid can shoulder stuff later.  So in summary my playoff thoughts would have to be...  Simmons: Learn to shoot because it's embarrassing but keep doing you.  Philly will survive even if Ben's ego doesn't.  MPJ: All of r/NBA is jealous of what you were basically born with.  Now we're waiting to see those talents get developed when legacy's on the line but yeah... haven't yet.  Even with the offensive void Murray left him.  Booker: Underperforming.  I get that his stats were always a bit fluffed since he carried so much of Phoenix's offensive load for so long, but we should still be seeing efficiency improvements now that CP3 is calling the shots.  Probably just an adjustment period and I'm not worried whatsoever, but he needs to shine just as brightly now alongside the new structure since it's the playoffs.  Conley: ummm...wish a couple more 3s had landed?  Lol I dunno the eye test just screams *~experience~* every time he directs the offense.  He's the only one you mentioned where you're gonna sound silly being critical.  Dude understands basketball so much better than me I'd feel guilty even typing out a critique."
PG - LaMelo Ball  SG - Donovan Mitchell  SF - Jimmy Butler  PF - Julius Randall  C - DeAndre Ayton
Good thing Tatum‚Äôs better than Donovan Mitchell
coming from a fan that has donovan mitchell as their franchise player lmao
"Definitely not pay him a max. He‚Äôs an actual trade candidate. They wouldn‚Äôt have to blow it up as they have Bam already, but they could get someone who matches the timeline better.  If Utah flops again, a Donovan Mitchell for Butler trade 1 for 1 could be something to look into."
"Zach Collins over Bam, Donovan Mitchell, OG Anunoby and John Collins. Woof."
Uhh it‚Äôs clearly Donovan Mitchell
"Can‚Äôt post the charts put here‚Äôs the text if you don‚Äôt wanna click:  Damian Lillard had reason to believe that Portland‚Äôs fans would make a difference in his first-round series against the Nuggets.   The Trail Blazers were the last NBA team to start allowing fans into their home arena this season‚Äîmuch to Lillard‚Äôs chagrin. But once they did, the Trail Blazers went 4-0 in home games with fans, including crucial wins over the Lakers and Nuggets that helped Portland avoid the play-in tournament.    The Ringer‚Äôs NBA Odds Machine  So good, it should come with a spoiler alert  Moreover, Portland has seemingly benefited from an extreme home-court advantage in recent playoff history. From 2013-14, Lillard‚Äôs first postseason, through 2018-19, the last postseason before the home-court-free bubble, the Trail Blazers were a miserable 6-21 on the road in playoff games‚Äîbut against those same teams at home, they were a much better 13-11. That gap represented one of the largest home-court advantages in the league.   So in advance of Game 3 in the Blazers‚Äô first-round series, with the Moda Center allowing four times the capacity that it did during the regular season, Lillard conveyed confidence in his home crowd. ‚ÄúWe know that our crowd is loud, our crowd has pride, they really care, and they gonna come ready,‚Äù Lillard said. ‚ÄúI know that‚Äôs going to play in our favor.‚Äù  And then the Trail Blazers lost Game 3 in front of those loud, prideful, caring fans, before winning Game 4 to salvage a split at home‚Äîjust as they‚Äôd split the two games in Denver to open the series. It turns out neither team‚Äôs home-court advantage mattered at all.  But it‚Äôs not just Lillard, and it‚Äôs not just Portland vs. Denver. Across the league, home-court advantage has disappeared in this postseason‚Äîeven as fans flock to arenas in their greatest numbers since the start of the pandemic, and even as players, coaches, and owners express excitement to play in front of the cheering masses once again.   ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be pretty special for our fans, just to have our fans in the building and make us proud,‚Äù LeBron James said before the first Lakers‚Äô home playoff games in eight years, and his first in Los Angeles. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I came here for, is to play a playoff game in front of the Lakers faithful.‚Äù  Except like Lillard‚Äôs Trail Blazers, LeBron‚Äôs Lakers split their two home games‚Äîjust as they‚Äôd split their two road games in Phoenix. Home-court advantage didn‚Äôt matter one bit.  Through 32 playoff games thus far, two home and two road for each club, home teams are 16-16. In the 16-team playoff era, home teams‚Äô winning percentage has never been close to this low‚Äîexcept last year, in the bubble, when ‚Äúhome-court advantage‚Äù by definition didn‚Äôt exist.    The same is true for point differential, rather than pure win-loss record. Historically, home teams have won their playoff games by an average of four to five points per game‚Äîbut this postseason, that average is down to 0.9 through 32 games, in line with the bubble playoffs (1.0) for the lowest by far.    Typically, the NBA‚Äôs home-court advantage is one of the strongest across the major North American sports, and it tends to increase in the postseason. From the expansion of the postseason bracket to 16 teams in 1983-84 through the 2018-19 season, home teams won 61 percent of their games in the regular season and 65 percent of their games in the playoffs. (That pattern holds even accounting for the fact that better teams play more home games in the playoffs. FiveThirtyEight‚Äôs Neil Paine calculated the same playoff boost of 4 percentage points even with this adjustment.)   But this postseason has been different. Since the introduction of the shot clock, 88 best-of-seven series before this season had started with the home teams winning four games in a row. For comparison, only six had started with the road teams winning four games in a row, meaning a home sweep of games 1 through 4 was 15 times more likely than a road sweep. Yet this year, no series started with four home wins in a row, while Clippers-Mavericks saw four consecutive road wins.  That‚Äôs just one data point, but it sure fits the larger pattern.  Best-of-Seven Series to Start With Four Road Wins  2021 First Clippers Mavericks ???  2017 First Celtics Bulls Celtics 4-2  2005 First Mavericks Rockets Mavericks 4-3  1995 Conference Finals Spurs Rockets Rockets 4-2  1994 Second Rockets Suns Rockets 4-3  1969 First Lakers Warriors Lakers 4-2  1963 Conference Finals* Celtics Royals Celtics 4-3  *Unlike the other series in this chart, which used the standard 2-2 format for the first four games, the Celtics and Royals alternated home courts for every game of their 1963 series. The sudden diminishment of home-court advantage could wreak unexpected effects on this postseason. Game 7s might not favor the home team as much as usual, for instance, and the presumed powerhouse clash between the Nets and Bucks in the second round might not hinge on the Nets‚Äô home-court advantage. The Lakers could win the title without hosting Game 1 in any round.   It‚Äôs still early in the playoffs, so the advantage could still tilt back toward the home teams in a Game 7, or in later rounds. And all this analysis comes with the caveat that injuries to stars have seemingly affected teams more at home thus far: Donovan Mitchell missed a home game for Utah; Anthony Davis missed half a home game for the Lakers; Kemba Walker and Robert Williams missed the same home game for Boston. (Injuries do go both ways, though: The 76ers‚Äô Joel Embiid missed most of Game 4, helping Washington to a home win.)  Yet this phenomenon fits with a recent trend in the regular season, too. From 1984 through 2013, home teams‚Äô winning percentage in the regular season never dipped below 60 percent leaguewide for more than one season in a row. But it‚Äôs been below 60 for eight regular seasons in a row now‚Äîreaching an all-time low, of course, this season, when most games had no crowds at all.    ESPN‚Äôs Kevin Pelton found that home-court advantage was stronger in games with fans this regular season, but in the postseason, teams with more fans aren‚Äôt benefiting from the extra crowd size. In fact, the correlation between attendance and home point differential is negative-0.22 so far, meaning more fans are associated with a worse performance from the home team.   Don‚Äôt read into that figure too far. The quality of the teams allowing larger crowds somewhat scrambles this analysis‚Äîfor instance, Miami could bring in 17,000 fans per home game, while Milwaukee was allotted just 9,100 in its first-round sweep. But as this graph shows, there‚Äôs also no evidence that larger crowds have helped the home team this postseason.    Crowds have helped the overall product, as players clearly enjoy competing in front of fans and the television viewing experience improves immensely with thousands of chanting, cheering mouths working in unison. (They‚Äôve also exposed a considerably uglier side, throwing popcorn and water bottles, and hurling spit and offensive invectives toward players and their families.)  But improving the general NBA experience is distinct from improving a specific team‚Äôs chances. Consider the Clippers and Mavericks once more: After much discourse around Mark Cuban‚Äôs desire to pack Dallas‚Äôs home arena, the Mavericks found enough legislative leeway to get to more than 17,700 fans for both home games‚Äîthe highest attendance for any team in the postseason. Dallas proceeded to lose both home games anyway.  As Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said before those losses, ‚ÄúJust because you‚Äôre home doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre going to walk out there and win a game. You‚Äôve still got to keep doing the things that you‚Äôve been doing well in previous games   I didn‚Äôt particularly care for this article that I read"
"Donovan Mitchell, I'm told"
Donovan Mitchell deserves to at least be shouted out
"I agree. I don't think there is anything to associate racism and bigotry with the bottle thrower, but Utah probably has a fair amount of fans in the stands who would disown their daughter if she came home with Donovan Mitchell."

Well he had a higher fg% than Donovan Mitchell and trae young on the year so I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs entirely true. And we all know both of them are stars
Trae is the best playmaker in the league going by BBall Index whereas Donovan Mitchell is only a little above average
Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert
donovan mitchell
"‚ÄúSorry Rudy, had our camera on your buddy Donovan Mitchell.‚Äù  Uhhhh should we tell him?"
r/nba: Donovan Mitchell is not a superstar.      NBA refs: Hold our prescription glasses.
Donovan ‚ÄúRick flair‚Äù Mitchell
"Yeah, Donovan Mitchell, the huge philanthropist, is a twat."
I‚Äôm gonna get downvoted but all the Jazz fans but I can‚Äôt stand Donovan Mitchell. Not saying he‚Äôs not good or whatever.
"Who remembers rookie Donovan Mitchell venting his frustration about Harden's ability to get calls a few years back? Can't help but chuckle and the look on his face as he gets up, he knows what he did lol  They grow so fast hahahaha"
Donovan Mitchell is giving him a run for his money right now. Soooooo many ticky tack foul calls.
The duel of DM Donovan Mitchell vs Deanthony Melton
Fuck Donovan Mitchell. He‚Äôs a scumbag
Donovan Mitchell doesn't even try to make the basket most of the times he's just trying to draw fouls. Weak way to win
Donovan Mitchell gets more ticky tack foul calls than James Harden. This is absurd.
Wow Donovan Mitchell is such a bitch
Idk why players don't just force the contact like Donovan Mitchell to get to the line more.  Seems to work for him pretty well.
Donovan Mitchell getting blocked by Ted Cruz im disappointed
Denver would have done rather well last year with Donovan Mitchell and Kawhi.
Donovan Mitchell is unstoppable. Grizzlies look lost
"If it makes u feel any better we passed on Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, and Wade/Bosh/Melo. Detroit has had its fair share of blunders in the draft"
"What? No he is not lol. James Harden, PG13, Donovan Mitchell, Jaylen Brown, Booker, Beal, and SGA I would say are better. I think u can flip between Shai and Zach but Shai have made huge improvements this year but ppl barely have watched OKC. His efficiency is still high despite being on a team with no help and his playmaking has gotten better plus he is an pretty good defender."
"Sir, no. You are forgetting Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown, Paul George, Fred VanVleet, Donovan Mitchell, Shia Gilgeous-Alexander, CJ McCollum and Terry Rozier who could arguably be better than him. Booker, Brown, Mitchell and George are all definitely better."
It was real nice of Donovan Mitchell and his family to help out Don Nelson with his shoe launch.
He's not even really better than Donovan Mitchell. Maybe worse. They're about the same to me.
Probably not the worst but Tyler Lydon and Trey Lyles for Donovan Mitchell was robbery
Tell that to Trae Young. And Donovan Mitchell. And like half the young stars in this league. What an all time clown take.
Donovan Mitchell?
Donovan Mitchell good
"Why would I compare Saric and Craig regular season stats when they have been playing WAY less. By your logic, Donovan Mitchell should be the GOAT because he had very high playoff performance points. Donte played 3 games that‚Äôs a small sample size"
"I'm not sure Simmons gets through on this. He's damaged goods right now. I replace him with Jamal Murray. Donovan Mitchell is also suspect, I might even take damaged Simmons over him."
"Why does 2016 matter in 2021? 2016 he had KD, and in 2012 he had KD and Harden. He hasn't really done shit else since 2016.  - 2017: Lost in the first round  - 2018: Bounced in the first round by rookie Donovan Mitchell  - 2019: Bounced in the first round by Lillard  - 2020: He finally gets out of the first round by beating an overachieving Thunder team with Harden. Westbrook averaged 14/6/4 on 42/16/50  He's been bounced in the first round every year except one since KD left and the one time he didn't he played like trash. He hasn't done shit worth praise in the playoffs in half a decade, and you're kinda admitting that too by talking about 2016"
Ben Simmons.  Play him at Point Center so Donovan Mitchell can play off ball more and get some easy cuts and open threes.
Donovan Mitchell
Jaylen Brown or Donovan Mitchell - both of whom are arguably preferable over anyone in that list.
Donovan Mitchell would have fit better
What Donovan Mitchell can do at 6‚Äô1‚Äù is pretty crazy. Particularly his inside game. Plays much taller than he is
Donovan Mitchell  for sure
"Donovan Mitchell is someone who comes to mind for me, closer to young Dame though."
"Well that does it, with this injury the suns will be promptly going home, and the hogs at milhuakey are loving it! They absolutely love it! With the loss of the ""Very great"" Torrey Craig, this is a complete wrap. Giannis ""Mickeyakumpo"" Will be taking home his ""ring"" once and for all. May he enjoy it, because it will likely be the last one! I weep, you guys, I weep!I'm thinking of Giannis finally teaming up with Donovan ""Robbed"" mitchell and I weep at how great that combination is! The trade will be as follows: Rudy ""Very valuable"" gobert and a wonderful first round pick for The Greek Freak! And we all know that Giannis will be demanding it!"
"If we‚Äôre talking about current players who elevate their game the most in the playoffs, Donovan Mitchell should be in the conversation"
Donovan Mitchell.
Donovan Mitchell.
"Whether it‚Äôs manifesting or not is probably debatable, but I saw an interview where Donovan Mitchell singled out getting better through the midrange as a key to him taking the next step  It just shows that at the highest levels, the guys who aspire to be great all know this is a critical part of your game. I‚Äôm here for it"
"On your team above, I would choose Cade Cunningham over Kevin Huerter for a wing (+he can handle the ball).  Also I would for sure have Donovan Mitchell on the team. I wouldn‚Äôt worry about the bigs/Cs too much. Only need to carry like 3 at most so you can cut Allen."

"Dame was remeasured with most of the league last season.  And I'm pretty sure that Donovan Mitchell went from 6'3"" to 6'1""."
 Here are my predictions:  **Western Conference**  *Starters*  G- Stephen Curry   G- Luka Doncic   F- LeBron James  F- Zion Williamson   F- Nikola Jokic   *Bench*  G- Devin Booker  G- Donovan Mitchell   F- Kawhi Leonard  F- Paul George   F- Anthony Davis   WC- Damian Lillard  WC- Deandre Ayton  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-  **Eastern Conference**  *Starters*  G- Trae Young  G- James Harden  F- Kevin Durant   F- Giannis Antetokounmpo   F- Joel Embiid   *Bench*   G- Kyrie Irving   G- Bradley Beal  F- Jayson Tatum  F- Julius Randle   F- Bam Adebayo   WC- LaMelo Ball  WC- Zach LaVine   ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
"West  S - Stephen Curry S - Luka Doncic S - LeBron James S - Kawhi Leonard S - Nikola Jokic B - Damian Lillard B - Devin Booker B - Paul George B - Zion Williamson B - Anthony Davis WC - Donovan Mitchell WC - Karl-Anthony Towns or Ja Morant or Chris Paul  Snubs - 2 omissions above and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Klay Thompson, and De‚ÄôAaron Fox  East  S - James Harden S - Kyrie Irving S - Kevin Durant S - Giannis Antetokounmpo S - Joel Embiid B - Trae Young B - Bradley Beal B - Jimmy Butler B - Jayson Tatum B - Bam Adebayo WC - choose 2 of Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Khris Middleton, Julius Randle, Domantas Sabonis, and Pascal Siakam"
Only players under 27 active now with a realistic sniff are Giannis and Luka that‚Äôs it   Zion is just pure speculation let‚Äôs see what he does year 3  Tatum hasn‚Äôt shown me top 10 all time potential and hasn‚Äôt got enough accolades going into year 5   Booker has no chance this is his 6th year I believe and he has been an all star reserve twice that‚Äôs his only accolades so far  Trae hasn‚Äôt shown top 10 potential either so far do you see him being better then Nash that‚Äôs the question   Booker is in his 6th year he has no chance and I would put Donovan Mitchell ahead of him on this list
"Donovan Mitchell, although it would be sad to see I think it's possible"
"I mean, the Blazers took Bowie at #2 with Jordan, Barkley and Stockton still available.  The Pistons took Darko at #2 with Wade, Bosh and Melo still available.  The Hawks took Marvin Williams at #2 with Chris Paul and Deron Williams still available (there used to be a discussion over who's better, CP3 or Deron)  The Heat took Beasley at #2 with Westbrook and Love still available.   The Grizzlies took Hasheem Thabeet at #2 with Harden, Steph Curry, DeRozan and Jrue Holiday still available.  The Wolves took Derrick Williams at #2 with Kemba, Klay, Kawhi and Butler still available.  The Bobcats took Michael Kidd-Gilchrist over Beal, Lillard, Middleton and Draymond.  The Lakers took Ball over Tatum, Donovan Mitchell and Bam.  Drafting is hard."
Donovan Mitchell looks like a football player playing basketball lmao. He's relatively short but he looks so large because he's nearly 230 as a point guard lol
"Nets easily beat the Bucks with a healthy Harden and Kyrie. They almost lost against just KD pretty much.   Suns went to six games with the Lakers, and that was with an injured Lebron and decoy Anthony Davis.   Suns then played a Denver team with no Jamal Murray, the second best player on the Nuggests.  Suns then played The Clippers with their best player in Kawhi not being able to play.   Suns are now playing the Bucks with their star player having ligament bruising/sprain.   That's just off the top of my head. Pretty sure Donovan Mitchell was injured at one point as well as Conley. Joel Embid also had injury questions with his knees as well.  There have plenty of series deciding injuries that have happened right before or during these playoffs that have changed the entire landscape. Suns don't get past a fully healthy lakers, I'm not even sure if they get past a fully healthy Denver. They have had break after break after break."
"Yea he doesn't have the frame. It's not just about height. Donovan Mitchell is like 6ft, but weighs 225. Has a near 7ft wingspan, huge hands and like size 17 shoes lol. He is more of a heavyweight than Curry and he is nearly 3 inches shorter."
"&gt;He locked down Mitchell  huh? Donovan Mitchell? LOL you sure about that? What's your definition of ""locked down""?"
"Bro the clippers lost their best player and you still couldn‚Äôt beat them. You guys also lost a 3-1 lead to the Nuggets last year WITH Mike Conley who then got destroyed by the eventual champions. You guys aren‚Äôt contenders at this moment. You rely way too much on the 3 and Donovan Mitchell isn‚Äôt good enough to carry you (yet, maybe he will be down the line)."
No they need more than that. The Jazz probably need another star scorer that can get their own shot or Donovan Mitchell needs to go from a star to a superstar (he‚Äôs not quite there yet).
Crazy how big Donovan Mitchell looks next to Trae. Same height but Spida has an extra 30 lbs of muscle on him.
"I wouldn‚Äôt trust OG to guard Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, De‚ÄôAaron Fox, Ja Morant, Jamal Murray, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine, Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Karl-Anthony Towns, DeAndre Ayton, or Nikola Vucevic for an entire game (not just a switch).  I‚Äôd trust Ben to do that for any of those players.  O.G. is a better asset but not the better defender.  Simmons is faster, stronger, and smarter."
"To me, it‚Äôs 4 years once you find that star to build around.  Say you hit big on the draft getting a Donovan Mitchell, Book, Trae, Luka, etc. Your goal immediately becomes to surround them with as much salary and talent to field a competitive team before they hit their max extension.   You obviously have to have an owner willing to go into the salary cap and into the luxury tax, but if you have an owner that isn‚Äôt willing to do that, you‚Äôre likely not going to have a successful rebuild and will be stuck in that process of shedding cap to stay under the tax while fielding a mediocre team and alienating your star because you can‚Äôt commit to putting them in a position to compete for a title."
"The NBA draft is practically just a huge group think draft it seems like now. It feels like GM's can just go on any of the media draft boards of the consensus to take the ""safe"" pick without worrying about any backlash from fans and media. Due to this group think nature imo is how you still get your Donovan Mitchell or Bam type of players that weren't top 10 picks that become All-Star caliber players, so how can GM's and the media both really explain missing on these players? Scouting is hard, but the actual hard decision making in the draft is actually taking someone that actually goes against the consensus imo, rather than just taking the safe pick that anybody can do. Pistons taking Cunningham would be an easy and safe decision, but if Green or Mosley end up being the better player, how can the media or GM's in general explain what went wrong? Taking Green or Mosley would take real guts to do for the Pistons, while going with Cunningham is the safe group think selection.   The top 3 media consensus barely, if ever goes according to plan outside of the 2016 draft, where Simmons, Ingram, and Jaylen Brown all went to be All-Stars. It seems like figuring out who in the consensus top 3-5 of the media boards that won't pan out pre-draft is the real scouting and hard work."
"Donovan Mitchell said he was ok as well, but he was clearly playing on 1 leg, it's what players say because they don't want to use it as an excuse"
"Lakers won 6 titles, the spurs won 5. The heat and the warriors won 3 titles each. One title each to pistons, Celtics, Mavericks, raptors and Cavs   LeBron has gone to 10 finals and is on pace to be the most points scored all time. The warriors went 73-9 to beat the bulls record for wins and lost to LeBron on the Cavs coming back 3-1, THEN added Kevin Durant (second best player of the last 15 years) who they beat 3-1 earlier in the playoffs  Best players of the last 23 years are LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony , Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Chris Paul, Dwight Howard, Steph Curry, Kevin Garnett, Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal, Paul Pierce, Dwyane Wade, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic and others. young players such as Trae Young, Luka Doncic, Zion Williamson, Ben simmons, Deandre Ayton, jayson tatum, Ja morant, De‚ÄôAaron Fox and Donovan Mitchell are up coming and exciting  I suggust watching thier highlights and if you get deeper into it watch playoff highlights for specific years to see who‚Äôs good and how the different titles were won. I love this shit so let me know if you have any questions or recommendations on where to start"
What if the Pistons pulled the trigger and traded Rip/Tayshaun for Kobe.  What if we took Donovan Mitchell over Luke Kennard.   What if we took Devin Booker over Stanley Johnson.   [Insert 2003 Draft Pick not named LeBron] over Darko Milicic.
I think either Jamal Murray or Donovan Mitchell could recapture their super-saiyan-disney-world-bubble form. Both those guys were legit as good as prime steph curry in that series
then why isn‚Äôt the MVP Donovan Mitchell
sounds about right for Donovan Mitchell tbh
"Haha never happened to me. The only player I get torched by is Donovan Mitchell, the guy takes 40 shots against me every game lmao."
"To me, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, and Jamal Murray are three peas in a pod. Only Mitchell was an all-star last year, but I think the three of them can all make jumps to all nba caliber at any moment. All of them are phenomenal in the playoffs and I think that if they translate their playoff play into the regular season, it'll be those teams topping the west for a long time."
"In the 2019 FIBA World Cup the US had a roster that had Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker, Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner and other NBA players coached by Gregg Popovich.  They didn't even make it to the Bronze game. They absolutely would not medal in the Olympics with those players."
"""Id like to see Donovan Mitchell on my team next year. What are the odds that happens?""  ftfy"
"His floor is a Jrue Holiday, which is already good. He has potential to be an all-star point-guard. Hell, maybe theres a chance that the Donovan Mitchell comparison actually come true. Anyway, Davion is my favorite player in this draft."
Davion Mitchell not Donovan
"Even with the questionable player evaluation they‚Äôve had in the past still 0% chance they trade Fox, he‚Äôs their Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Bradley Beal, etc."
"Pippen led his team to a 54 win record and the second round as the #1 option. On like 23/6/6 with worse efficiency than his years with MJ.  He did something that at least 8 players do every year (make it to second round). Other players who have led their team to 50 wins and the second round as a #1 option include  DeMar DeRozan, Donovan Mitchell, Paul George, John Wall, Jimmy Butler, Jermaine O'Neal, Vince Carter, Carmelo Anthony, and Blake Griffin.   Before you say how Scottie finished 3rd for MVP that year, so did Paul George, Blake Griffin, Jermaine O'Neal, and Carmelo (2nd).  Meanwhile AI actually WON the MVP and led his team to 60 wins as the #1 guy. He was also universally viewed as a top 3 player from 1999 - 2003. Whereas Scottie was always in the second tier of the top 10 after guys like MJ, Robinson, Hakeem, Shaq, and Barkley."
They barely beat the 2017 team in 7.  1. PG - De‚ÄôAaron Fox vs. Trae Young 2. SG - Donovan Mitchell vs. Shai Gilgeous Alexander 3. SF - Jayson Tatum vs.  Luka Doncic 4. PF - John Collins vs. Michael Porter Jr 5. C - Bam Adebayo vs De‚ÄôAndre Ayton 6.  Lonzo Ball vs Devonte Graham 7. Markelle Fultz vs. Collin Sexton 8. O.G. Anunoby vs. Mikal Bridges 9. Jonathan Issac vs Jaren Jackson Jr 10. Jarrett Allen vs Mitchell Robinson 11. Monte Morris vs. Jalen Brunson 12. Derrick White vs Kevin Huerter or Donte DiVincenzo 13. Josh Hart or Kyle Kuzma vs Miles Bridges 14. Lauri Markannen vs Robert Williams 15. Thomas Bryant vs Wendell Carter Jr
There‚Äôs actually a report out there that Dmitch is going away from dunking a lot to save his legs if you check by season he has had less and less dunks.   https://kslsports.com/453294/donovan-mitchell-slowly-saying-goodbye-to-dunks/?
&gt;Donovan Mitchell is greater than Malone or Stockton  Bruh what?
"Donovan Mitchell, Curry, Dame, Steph, Jamal Murray, Magic  Sorry I have a top 6"
"Neil absolutely deserves shit for 2017 when he could have gotten Donovan Mitchell (Lillard was begging Olshey to draft him) and imo, if Paul Allen were still alive, he would have fired Neil for that reason alone.  That said, Portland fans are being a little too possessed by their emotions.  First, no key free agent is coming to Portland so expecting the GM to do something there is simply unrealistic.  Second, Olshey's trades have mostly been good for the team.  RoCo, Nurkic, Trent Jr./Powell.    Third, Neil can find good guards.  Lillard, CJ, Simons, Bledsoe, Gordon.  And finally, Olshey tried to tank so Dame and CJ would have a third wheel.  His logic was sound as the lottery is the only certain place to find an All-Star for the team but Portland was too good.  If Portland fires him, it should be for a different direction and not because of some unrealistic expectations."
Yeah bro but it‚Äôs funnier on Reddit website to say they traded Donovan Mitchell for Trey Lyles
The pick that became?  [They literally traded Donovan Mitchell lol.](https://www.parlons-basket.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/donovan-mitchell-draft-nuggets-1024x683.jpg)
Nuggets traded the pick that became Donovan Mitchell for him lmao
Im 100% taking Donovan Mitchell over Klay come on my guy averaged 35ppg over the last 2 playoffs
Dominique for power Zach Lavine for grace.....Donovan Mitchell gets a nod from me because I never expect him to boom on people and he always does
Not happening anytime soon but Donovan Mitchell would be perfect
"Prime lebron has to be up there, obviously. And MJ for that matter.   Donovan Mitchell dunks are always special"
In order for me  Vince Carter DJJ Donovan Mitchell  Ja Morant Russ  I haven‚Äôt seen enough of Gerald Green or Lavine to have a place for them
Donovan Mitchell does the same weak ass 1 handed dunk every time
Scottie Pippen &amp; Donovan Mitchell
"I definitely was in the Donovan Mitchell is an overrated chucker camp, still am at times, but this year and it seems like with each playoff game I become more and more impressed with him."
Myles Turner and Donovan Mitchell were the color commentators for the 2020 Rising Stars game
The article lists:  1. Zion Williamson 2. Donovan Mitchell  3. Karl Anthony Towns 4. De‚ÄôAaron Fox 5. Zach Lavine
Donovan Mitchell
This feels like when people tried to say gobert was better than Donovan Mitchell. Just stop it. Aytons been fantastic but he has not been the main driving force behind this team.
"The 2019 world cup roster:  Derrick White, Donovan Mitchell, Joe Harris, Marcus Smart, Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Mason Plumlee, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Kemba Walker"
I'd rather take Donovan Mitchell.
"Yep, and it's not like the Clippers played fully healthy teams to get to the WCF either, playing against a Mavs team where Luka had a neck strain that didn't allow him to turn his head and a Jazz team missing Mike Conley and that featured a badly hobbled Donovan Mitchell. But obviously both the Suns and Clippers have had their own absence and injury issues, with CP3 having the shoulder injury in the 1st round then Covid in the WCF, along with Payne's ankle injury; and with Kawhi's ACL injury, Zubac with the MCL injury and Ibaka with season-ending back surgery.  The reality is that it's been an injury-littered landscape for everyone in these playoffs. Nobody's been 100% at full strength, and they haven't been fully healthy themselves. It's a totally anomalous playoffs, but the Suns have navigated these bizarre circumstances better than anyone else so far. If they win it all they'll have deserved it."
Donovan Mitchell was 80% of himself and Mike Conley didn't play for 5 games. Not to mention Luka had one of the best first round performances of all time and the Mavs role players were literally shooting better from 3 than prime Steph Curry in their wins.
"I think Booker is a better offensive player and playmaker than Donovan Mitchell, I know its not his fault truly but giving up a 3-1 lead against the Nuggets and then losing a 2-0 lead against the clippers with no Kawhi, it just throws me off in ranking him. Also some of the games I watched, he was just chucking up horrible shots and taking contested fadeaway 3s which bricked."
"I think he was not being properly utilized (especially by Saunders) on top of being the primary vet on the youngest (2nd youngest?) team in the league. Dude was clearly being stretched thin and was trying to teach half the starters defense in-game. To really sum it up I think he was being asked to do way more than he ever should have been instead of just being told to just play his game. Not to mention the DLo/Rubio rotations were just never quite figured out (again, especially under saunders. We‚Äôll see more of Finch‚Äôs vision after the offseason). As far as I understand it Rosas brought Rubio back to provide Anthony Edwards with the mentoring that Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker benefitted from. It totally worked too as the Ant/Rubio bromance is very real. Rubio got a ton of slander from other Timberwolves fans but I feel like it was pretty obvious he was being asked to do way too much (you would literally see him basically coaching players in between plays). If our coaches just asked him to play his game I think he‚Äôs the same player he always was, but they didn‚Äôt, so he wasn‚Äôt.  Edit: to be clear these are all just my takes on the situation and to answer your last question: I don‚Äôt think they trade him unless they get a solid offer. Definitely not looking to unload him. His relationship with Ant and the fact that Ant has a crazy amount of potential means they‚Äôre kind of a package deal in my eyes. Plus I would personally love to see Rubio retire in a Wolves jersey."
"Just off the top of my head he has tried to injure / attacked: Tony Parker, Lebron, mike Conley, Westbrook, Donovan Mitchell and now Chris Paul.  I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm missing many more.  The dirty stuff is not minimal at all."
I feel like the Knicks can attract Donovan Mitchell now that the Knicks have made the playoffs.
Not to get political in r/nba (sorry) but this is actually a good chance for Donovan Mitchell to casually call out the Republicans nonsense bogeyman obsession with CRT. He‚Äôs a smart guy.
Donovan Mitchell boutta go 52/12/12 on this clown w crazy efficient splits
"I mean he blew a 3-1 lead to the Nuggets last year. Then in 2019, he got sent home by Dame (though he was decent) Then in 2018, he got put out by rookie Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert. We can keep going.   His shooting percentage in a bunch of those games are pretty bad. He underperforms more than he shows out."
PG has that Donovan Mitchell dead mans stare
"To be totally fair, professional athletes, celebrities, AREN'T affected to nearly the same degree as everyday people by political policies. Just for example, Donovan Mitchell didn't really have anything at stake in the Georgia election in January, because things like stimulus checks and rental assistance simply dont matter to him because he does not ever have to worry about eviction or putting food on his family's table.   So I get the sentiment, the rich live outside of everyday America, politics included. They should just enjoy their money and generally not get involved."
What makes you say Booker is a better playmaker than Mitchell?   Donovan averages more assists
Maybe this is a cold take but I like vecenie.  I dunno a specific guy but I remember he was buying into Donovan Mitchell bc he said he watched him practice in summer between freshman and sophomore yr.  It's a pod so idr but he generally is good at his job imo.
I'm waiting for next season when Donovan Mitchell goes off and the TNT squad is asking questions.i hope he just takes of his head set when it gets to shaq
That‚Äôs true but media didn‚Äôt give Donovan Mitchell a All NBA spot. Media opinions should be taken with a grain of salt.
I always thought he could be as good as Donovan Mitchell
"7.4% of his 2 point FGs were assisted. That‚Äôs second lowest in the league behind none other than Tremont Waters. That‚Äôs crazy. Luka is 9.5% and Donovan Mitchell 15% for comparison. Statistically, he‚Äôs better at getting his own shot than Luka. Maybe not in reality, but that‚Äôs still impressive. I put his trade value incredibly high, probably close to what OKC fans think."
"Giannis handles it really well. Imagine how it must have felt to see all of Twitter slandering him the last few weeks, making memes that he's not in his bag, repeating ""The Count."" Giannis however was positive, complimentary of other players (KD) and kept it pushing. What I like about him is that he's hard on himself. He knows his flaws. He'll be the first person to tell you that he messed up or isn't rising to the occasion. That's what makes him unique. Other new superstars are also handling it well. Look at Donovan Mitchell, that exchange with TNT, when they basically said, I don't think you're good enough or whatever. He was such a champ. Classy."
"Mostly because being an athlete doesn‚Äôt make you more qualified to speak on political topics. Yes everyone wants to and has a right to speak their mind and use their platform, but honestly why is Donovan Mitchell the human being somehow the most qualified to talk to lawmakers about critical race theory?"
"What are the Suns front offices even doing?  You could not take fully advantage of the Clippers superteam being injured because your coaches are completely being outcoached and coaching like it is the 90s.  People in general overestimate a team Championship window, even a Superstar like ~~Chris Paul LOL wait~~ Devin Brooker that isn't injury prone can suffer a freak injury out of nowhere so you have to take full advantage of your Superstar right now, not next year or the year after.   What are the Jazz front offices even doing?  You could not take fully advantage of the Clippers superteam being injured because your coaches are completely being outcoached and coaching like it is the 90s.  People in general overestimate a team Championship window, even a Superstar like Donovan Mitchell that isn't injury prone can suffer a freak injury out of nowhere so you have to take full advantage of your Superstar right now, not next year or the year after."
Donovan Mitchell would have been long gone by then so no.
"at the same time right now some of the biggest playoff performers are booker, kawhi, giannis, donovan mitchell, middleton, jokic who were all drafted either way late in the lottery or beyond  so when people say a draft only goes 5 deep I don't really put a lot of stock in that either"
Man that 2017 draft fucked us really badly in hindsight   Had we gone for Tatum or even Fox things might‚Äôve been different now   And while he might‚Äôve been a reach considering where he ended up being picked at - even Donovan Mitchell would‚Äôve set us up well    But selecting Markelle  Bust kicked into gear a series of events that has landed us where we are at today
"You're underrating it, Edwards is just like Donovan Mitchell and I can see him completely lighting it up in playoff time just like him. Hes already shown he can show up being one of the best 4th quarter players in the entire NBA this season.   Dlo KAT Ben, Edwards can easily have nights in the playoffs where hes going off for like 40+ like Donovan, hes bigger and a better finisher."
"Elite ball handling guards and wings from 2009 to 2019: Harden, Kyrie, Donovan Mitchell, Luka, Trae, Dame, beal, Steph, Khris Middleton, devin booker, Jamal Murray, Ja Morant. There are twelve all-star level guards in eleven years. If we just take the top half that is Harden, Steph, Beal, Luka, Trae, and Dame which is six in eleven years or about one every other year."
"Already top 5 guard? What are you smoking?  1. You're wrong, if he was an all time guard in the making he would be way more consistent at this point, its not like he is a rookie. Both Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell are way more consistent than him.  2. I think Ben Simmons imploding on the Phillies, or Raptors getting a Kawhi rental and winning a quick chip easily proves that you trade for the best player when you can."
Maybe like a Donovan Mitchell? He‚Äôs obv great but most wouldn‚Äôt put him in top 10 he‚Äôll maybe not top 20 in the league but he could get the jazz to the finals eventually
Your forgot Donovan Mitchell and Kawhi.
Poor Trae is looking like Donovan Mitchell. Playing so hard but he's so hurt
Donovan Mitchell
"I swear I just saw a post of donovan mitchell going over 10 for 2 free throws straight, but they didn't call it"
so was donovan mitchell and james harden an injury affects your play cockboy
"What if, what if, what if.  What if Zach Collins didn't keep getting injured? Then it would have been seen as a great move.  What if they kept their #15 and #20 and missed on both?  What if they grabbed Donovan Mitchell instead of Zach Collins?  It is pointless to look at moves down the road in hindsight. There will almost always be better moves for you to do, players who do better than their draft position."
"I've been a fan of the NBA for over 50 years.  I live in the suburbs of DC and became a bullets fan in 1967 when they drafted Wes Unseld, and went from doormats of the league to winning their division and Wes was only the second player ever to win MVP and rookie of the Year awards.  I agree with your choices of non-dominant players on those Mavericks and Heat team and interestingly that Heat team beat a highly favored Mavericks team to win.  I enjoyed seeing that Mavericks team beat the LeBron led Miami Heat teams.  Both my sons 32 and 29 are big NBA fans We watch a lot of the games together, and talking about the Brooklyn Nets and the LA Clippers I was talking to them about those two teams and how they were stacked with veterans.  That 2006 Shaquille O'Neal Dwyane Wade team had Gary Payton a point guard Williams Antoine Walker Alonso morning backing up Shaq.....  That Mavericks team that beat LeBron had all kinds of old veterans Tyson Chandler Jason Kidd Jason Terry Sean Marion they also had Quran Butler but he was hurt when they went to the finals and another wizard a guyI never liked Deshawn Stevenson who came up huge  for them.   I would disagree with you about generational talent Trey Young is as good a guard as I've seen as is Donovan Mitchell ,Devin booker, Jamal Murray he didn't get to play, Jokic, Doncic, ,etc. A  big crop ofgreat players and time will show which of them is truly a generational talent."
What if the jazz offered up Donovan Mitchell?
"You‚Äôre getting Portland, one of the most progressive cities in America, confused with what Utah fans will do when Donovan Mitchell wants out in a few years"
"Imagine like a smaller Jordan, but like late '80s-early '90s Jordan, not second threepeat post-up/fadeaway Jordan. Or like a bigger, stronger Donovan Mitchell who doesn't shoot threes and plays elite defense."
"A bigger, more athletic Donovan Mitchell, much stronger too. Not as good a jumpshot, but Wade could make them streakingly. Elite defender too. Just more violent, kinda like Ja, but Wade was actually making them more often than not and got to the line well"
"the best modern comparison for his slashing is probably donovan mitchell imo. like that but a little better, and got to the rim more often. then trade all of donovan's threes for midrange shots. better in transition, got to the line more."
"He could take anyone off the dribble.  Would get into the paint at will and was capable of scoring over and around defenders.  Incredible first step, explosive and strong finisher.  He wasn't a great outside shooter but had a decent mid-range jumper he could get most of the time, due to his quickness and jumping ability.  Think Donovan Mitchell but bigger, quicker, stronger, more explosive and a better finisher/playmaker."
Playoff Donovan Mitchell but in the regular season
"1 wiseman was a rookie last year who played 3 games as a freshman in Memphis before his season ended.  2 IMO, Bigs like wiseman don‚Äôt fit well in what GS likes to do offensively. So judging him off of those factors are premature to say he‚Äôs not going to end up as a good NBA player  3 What do Steph Curry, DeMar Derozan, Paul George, Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Vucevic, Jimmy Butler, CJ McCollum, Giannis, Julius Randle, Devin Booker, Jamal Murray, Damontas Sabonis, Pascal Siakam, Donovan Mitchell, Collin Sexton and MPJ all have in common?  Don‚Äôt act like later round lottery draft picks don‚Äôt turn into all-star caliber, even MVP caliber nba players"
Only if they add in Donovan Mitchell
"Yeah, but a hurt Donovan Mitchell was still having monster games. I think it would have been a good series regardless."
  Donovan Mitchell is so much better than Booker. The Jazz should be going to the finals TBH.
Put Donovan Mitchell in place of booker and this would have been a suns sweep
Donovan Mitchell &gt; Booker
Donovan Mitchell is much closer to Kobe than Book is. Man was dropping 30 on us on 1 ankle.
"there is 0 reason he should've lost to a rookie Donovan Mitchell. and lost in a quick 5 to Blazers  Giannis is miles more efficient, free throws included, and doesn't take as many long 2's, the most inefficient shot, as Westbrook"
That disrespect to Donovan Mitchell
Donovan Mitchell
It‚Äôs actually Stephen A Smith due the fact he doesn‚Äôt even try to push analysis that centers around basketball anymore. It was a point SAS was in tune with the game and actually discussed the nuisance but eventually he learned his bread and butter is just screaming controversial takes that‚Äôll circulate online.   Stephen just makes bold claims like ‚ÄúKAWHI NEEDS TO WIN OR HIS LEGACY IS FINISHED!!!‚Äù or ‚ÄúDONOVAN MITCHELL IS DWAYNE WADE 2.0‚Äù not even discussing the similarities and differences or why he would even make that comparison.
Was signed to be a backup point guard at the tail end of the Stockton to Malone era.  Decided he didn't like that role and attempted to mutiny the bench players against Stockton so he would start instead.  This year claimed that Donovan Mitchell was faking his ankle injury to avoid criticism during the playoffs.  Fuck Mark Jackson.
You just described every Donovan Mitchell hater.
"76ers fan, I actually love Donovan Mitchell. He would be the perfect Philly athlete too"
Donovan Mitchell
I feel like Donovan Mitchell is allowed to shit on a guy like Jerome Whitehead
"""Donovan Mitchell is the best Jazz player ever"""
Davion Mitchell teammates with Donovan Mitchell
"I used to think he was okay, until he said Donovan Mitchell is the greatest Jazz player of all time, its like Karl malone and John Stockton never existed. With me personally he has zero credibility."
‚ÄúDonovan Mitchell jealous of the star treatment shown to Jordan Clarkson for receiving 6MOTY. Demands to be traded to Clarkson‚Äôs former team to be Lakers‚Äô sixth man.‚Äù
now I know you're trolling.  Mike Conley missed games 1-5 against the Clips.  Donovan Mitchell injured his ankle at the end of game 2.
He‚Äôs not.  JVG &amp; Chuck both said a lot of players do it.  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nvpo4x/highlight_donovan_mitchell_commits_a_10_second/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf  Clip of Donovan Mitchell doing it.
&gt; Donovan Mitchell literally takes around 10 seconds or more to shoot a FT.  That‚Äôs just not a factual statement
"The Jalen Brunson - Luke Ridnour comparison is a random one but it seems very accurate to me.  The Donovan Mitchell pre-draft comparisons (Avery Bradley, Gary Harris, etc) look silly because we now know how good he is offensively as a ball handler and pull up shooter.  Generally most 3 and D prospects have pretty accurate comparisons. OG Anunoby, Mikal Bridges, etc. are pretty much who we thought they'd be in terms of play style."
Donovan Mitchell was injured. Still balled out.
Donovan Mitchell takes more than 10 seconds as well but no one makes a big deal out of it.  I have no idea what why people get excited over a subpar FT shooter taking long.
The Donovan Mitchell slander not putting him the picture
"I'm wondering if anyone actually listened to what she said, or the context in which she said it.  I mean, even halfway through the conversation, she talks about Donovan Mitchell leaving Utah and then almost immediately says ""I'm not saying Donovan Mitchell wants out, aggregators,"" because she knows that they do shit like this, taking stuff out of context so that people will get riled up, knowing that they barely ever go to the original source.  The context here is that McMullan is on Bill Simmons' podcast, and Simmons wants to know which team Durant's legacy will lie with when the enters the Hall.  They have a brief discussion about baseball, where the hat on the plaque still matters to people, and Simmons points out that in the NBA, a lot of people are less fans of a team, and more fans of a player, noting that there's a significant number of people who are just Durant fans, not Nets fans or Warriors fans or Thunder fans.  ""My son is 13,"" says Simmons, ""and he has friends who just root for players.  They don't have teams.""  *""He's the most versatile offensive player I've ever seen,""* says McMullan.  *""Look at Durant.  He can beat you off the dribble, he can create his own shot, he can shoot threes, he shoots free throws, he can... he's got a lefty hook, a righty hook, he can score out of the post, like, he's unbelievable.  He's unbelievable.  And, I mean, I do think, in talking with him, his genuine goal is to win three championships in Brooklyn and make that his place, his team, his legacy.  Now that could've happened this year, but a lot of weird stuff happened.""*  Simmons goes on to talk about how many titles LeBron *should* have won, and how many title Durant *should* have won, and McMullan replies, *""I don't think Durant cares about that kind of stuff, you know, like LeBron is constantly looking at his legacy, the far reach, and can I, you know, Jordan and that whole thing.  I just don't think, Durant, honest to God, the amount of times I've talked to him, I just think Durant is searching for something he's never gonna find.  I honestly believe that.  I think he's searching for this inner peace, this happiness, this joy, that just isn't ever going to exist for him.  I wish that weren't true, but it's just, it's my own personal opinion.  And maybe, you know, if it can happen in Brooklyn with his friend Kyrie, good friends long before they made this union, they used to work out together, they go to the Bahamas together .... that friendship is real, it wasn't just for convenience to come to Brooklyn and win something, it's a legitimate friendship, but I just think he's searching for something he's never gonna find.""*  I don't know how anyone can listen to that conversation and come to the conclusion that either one of them are quoting Durant directly, or even alluding to something he said in confidence.  It's two people, both of whom have covered Durant extensively, giving their opinions about him.  You might argue that they are shitty, ill-formed opinions, but she's not asserting or implying anything."
He is actually really fast but not the quickest from a standstill or shifty like Donovan Mitchell. Etc. he‚Äôs lethal in transition because once he gets rolling he‚Äôs really fast. Same deal with his vertical. When he‚Äôs got a head of steam he can get up from when it‚Äôs crowded in the lane he can‚Äôt elevate like the top tier guys.
"It's so widespread that I don't really have particular guys off the top of my head that do it egregiously. I remember Isaiah Thomas used to get a lot of flack for it before his hip injury. The Jazz are the only team I watch consistently and Donovan Mitchell definitely does it all the time.  I don't blame the players for it. The refs never call it, so you're just going to be at a disadvantage to the other 29 teams if you try not to carry."
"Everyone wants to talk about Lebron‚Äôs injury like he wasn‚Äôt clowning Crowder in game 3 and getting his head above the rim on dunks. Maybe, just maybe, our defense selling out to stop his drives to the rim played a massive part in our wins, even more than Lebron‚Äôs injury.   Chris Paul was a negative on the court in every single game but one. AD was legitimately better in that series, it‚Äôs not really debatable.   Everyone was expecting Lebron to go off, and he didn‚Äôt. You can blame injuries if you want, but he clearly wasn‚Äôt more hurt than a guy like Donovan Mitchell, who actually put up a fight for his team unlike Lebron"
"Completely accurate. Stephen A is a basketball insider with sources and more information that we'll ever know. And all that said, these dudes getting the fake internet points aren't that far from Stephen A getting real viewership dollars. Dude has to know that Mitchell isn't the best Jazz player of all time. There are these guys named Karl Malone, John Stockton, Pete Maravich. Donovan is a beast, but these dudes are all top of the mountain players. It's a ridiculous hot take to say he is in that realm yet."
"Confidence is fine, this dude is on his Kenny Powers.  &gt;people act like we‚Äôre the Jazz or whoever the clips faced.  He means the 1st seed Jazz with Donovan Mitchell injured, and the Nuggets with Jamal Murray out, while they're playing against the Clippers without Kawhi."
"Its not an overpay when Ben cant help us be a really good defensive team, Edwards could end up having a Donovan Mitchell season next year and we know what KAT is capable of already."
Donovan Mitchell is a nice dude but Shaq was clearly right tbh
"He averages 8 seconds, I remember seeing the stat other day. Of course that‚Äôs only the average, and his fts get longer as he gets more fatigued throughout the game, but refs let you get away with a lot of stuff late game. Moving screens and 5-second violations being the chief calls that are given much leeway late game.  Also Donovan Mitchell consistently goes over 10 sec as well"
The anti Donovan Mitchell
Donovan Mitchell and Jeremy Evans
Not as cute a couple as Donovan Mitchell and Jaylen Brown.  I miss those bubble moments.  I wish those two could play together sometime.  Imagine Brown on the Jazz to help Mitchell.
"What does COVID protocol have to do with anything? Injured players are allowed to sit on the bench, they‚Äôve been doing it all season. If anything, I‚Äôd think sitting in a suite then joining the team would cause more concern from a COVID point of view.  As for the injury itself, I‚Äôm not saying he gotta be jumping up and down like a cheerleader and putting unnecessary strain on his knee but lots of players had lower body injuries that kept them out these playoffs and they still managed to be on the bench supporting their team in any way they can. If he needs treatment that‚Äôs one thing but Conley, AD, Danny Green, DeAndre Hunter, Donovan Mitchell, Jamal Murray etc etc all were on the bench"
It‚Äôs really remarkable the progress he‚Äôs already made. He went from sixth man/spot up shooter in college to a top sg occasionally offense. He‚Äôs honestly not even the most gifted player. Someone like Donovan Mitchell is much quicker and athletic.
"The sentence structure is wrong in the title   &gt;Stephen A. Smith after he proclaimed Donovan Mitchell as the best Jazz player ever: 4 straight losses in the Western Conference Semis  You're talking about Mitchel so it doesn't make sense to say SAS first. It's should be ""Donovan Mitchell after SAS proclaimed him as the best jazz player ever:...""  Not trying to be an asshole i promise, just saying."
Jamal Murray is absolutely better than sabonis. He‚Äôs not that different from Donovan Mitchell and Booker. Sabonis is just Dollar Store Jokic
He‚Äôs done his job against Donovan Mitchell and now Booker.
"I hate it too, but I guess that's just what the league is now because everyone does something that irks me. Donovan Mitchell took 5 steps every time he drove to the rim last series. PG literally always gets away with those push offs that are blatant (Kawhi does too, but he doesn't do it as often). Luka wraps his arm around his defender as he forces them to ride him to the rim. Harden kicks both legs out where he's almost completely horizontal on every 3. And then we have Jokic swinging his elbows like a prime Shaq.  I know stars have always gotten away with more, but I don't know why it seems like now more than ever the refs just do not call shit on stars."
his defense didn't show in the mavs series at all. in the utah series donovan mitchell lit them up. perimeter defending does not matter as much as interior defense and does not make up for shooting poorly.
"Let's dead the ""Pat Bev trick y'all"" stuff once and for all. He's had Donovan Mitchell and now Booker in JAIL for multiple games."
"lol sit down, homer, and read my comment again. No one cares how well he played in Game 1. Donovan Mitchell and Luka had adorably good game 1s as well."
Let‚Äôs add Donovan Mitchell as well because fuck it
As a Jazz fan who lives a block from the arena...this is why I'm asking the question.  After Atlanta's dumbfounding post season I think Mitchell could will himself more points than Trae certainly (better athlete obvs) but Young gives you *elite* playmaking *and* scoring.  It's just more versatile.  Essentially I'd give Donovan a slight edge in talent (ape index same as Kawhi) and proven success since entering the league vs Trae's skill and team-wide offensive lift.  I'm not saying one is better than the other yet but Trae seems to pivot out to his team better when his shots aren't falling and that's why I wanted this conversation.  He's God Tier right now.
Lebron was playing through an injury at an age where his HOF peers could barely run up and down the court. Calling him a quitter is crazy.   Do you think Jayson Tatum is a quitter because he left a playoff game after getting poked in the eye? Because Lebron stays in the game when that happens to him. Do you think Donovan Mitchell is a quitter because he missed Game 1 of the playoffs with a high ankle sprain? Because LeGrampa still went out there and played.
Donovan Mitchell
Donovan Mitchell does the same thing but a) it takes far less time and b) he shoots 84%.
"Jokic was doing some crazy things too, he just had an awful team around him. Giannis is putting up nearly 30 point triple doubles nearly every game. Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young and Luka Doncic are leading their teams.  I love Trae but he‚Äôs not an MVP yet. But he‚Äôs definitely playing incredible ball in these playoffs."
"This is why I like the new lottery odds. Teams like OKC this year blatantly tanking and holding out their best players for lotto ball odds shouldn‚Äôt be consistently rewarded with top 3-5 picks. Honestly while I think Presti is a fantastic executive, the Thunder‚Äôs situation rn reminds me of the Celtics from 2018-now. Mid first round picks in the NBA are such a crapshoot that they really aren‚Äôt as valuable as a lot of people believe. For every Donovan Mitchell or Devin Booker or Klay Thompson there‚Äôs 100 Jimmer Fredettes and Jerome Robinsons."
I remember how destroyed I got on this subreddit for suggesting he was overrated last year. I was a huge Donovan Mitchell ROTY supporter over Simmons and never let it go how mediocre I thought Simmons was. His attitude sucks too. Not a likable player. Glad everyone else is coming around to it finally
"&gt; Luka would have to basically be the GOAT, with another player being like Top 20 all time, OR, this class would to have like 3-4 guys be Top 10-15 players. For 96, again, Luka will need to end up being one of the 10 best players ever, with Trae Young and Ayton being on the short list for consideration as Top 30 guys  Yeah, I think the most likely way for this class to stand out is Luka being a top 5 all timer, Trae being a playoff performer that pushes him into top 20, and Ayton being in the top 30 conversation. I wouldn't say it's likely to happen and wouldn't place the bet, but I see the path towards those standings. The flip side is if you ask me about the 09 class do I see Steph being top 5 all time? No. Do I see Harden being top 20? No. If you ask me about the 2017 class, can I envision any future where Jason Tatum or Donovan Mitchell is a top 10 all time player? Not as easily as Luka."
Donovan Mitchell is his bff.. he wanted blazers to draft him badly
"Donovan Mitchell had 39 points, 9 assists and 9 rebounds - almost a 40 point triple double. There's no way you can get that while playing hurt."
"Jaylen Brown as well, Conley on the Jazz, Donovan Mitchell was clearly playing hurt. Oladipo on the Heat."
"Trae Donovan Mitchell  Ingram Zion Julius Randle  CJ McCullom  John Collins Liangelo  Playmaking, 3pt shooting, and muscle. Think that five is stronger than any starting five the current olympic team could make IMO. Didn't look it up but probably just named all the olympic camp alternate invites."
"15 players according to Bobby Marks, Kevin Pelton, and Mike Schmitz of ESPN this year. Here are the 15 players they‚Äôd take ahead of Trae:  1. Luka Doncic 2. Zion Williamson 3. LaMelo Ball 4. Donovan Mitchell 5. Jayson Tatum 6. De‚ÄôAaron Fox 7. Ben Simmons 8. Devin Booker 9. Bam Adebayo 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Brandon Ingram 12. Jaylen Brown 13. Jamal Murray 14. Michael Porter Jr. 15. Ja Morant"

Donovan Mitchell?
"Lol the older gen is trippin, you telling me Donovan Mitchell Damian Lillard and lebron James arent hard workers? The older gen can suck it, they raised this current gen if there's any problems it ain't that. This is boomer shit"
Davion ü§ù Donovan  Being a steal of a Mitchell drafted at 13
Donovan Mitchell has the exaggerated swagger of a black Spider-Man
Donovan Mitchell really makes you *feeeeeel* like Spidaman.
"He stopped driving because we went to a zone defense and were collapsing on his drives heavily. Ayton was contesting Lebron incredibly well around the rim, then he stopped driving.   Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt say he was 70% if y‚Äôall win. It‚Äôs like Jazz fans saying they could‚Äôve won the series if Donovan Mitchell wasn‚Äôt hurt... yeah okay buddy"
"@ Toronto fans excited to assumedly be getting Suggs‚Ä¶. Ima let y‚Äôall finish but Davian Mitchell will be a better pro. Book it  Suggs is *safe*.  Mitchell is **dynamic**. I see raw Russell Westbrook coming out of UCLA, Colin Sexton but with passing ability and defense, and yes donovan Mitchell.   With Suggs I see‚Ä¶Lonzo Ball. I see Chauncey billups. Not bad of course, but a lot had to go right for billups to get where he got. You don‚Äôt really project a player to be Chauncey billups Bc it‚Äôs more mental and you can‚Äôt really duplicate that. You can duplicate athletic profile and skill set tho. Mitchell is that guy   The biggest red flag for Suggs is: he has no mid range game. Stars have mid range games. Pull ups, hesi‚Äôs, shot making, etc. Suggs has a cap to his game that no one is talking about."
"And Donovan Mitchell just averaged 35/5/5 vs them and might've carried the series if not for his ankle injury, are we throwing him a parade too?"
Donovan Mitchell hurt his ankle‚Ä¶
he‚Äôs gonna be the next donovan mitchell
"Wait are you serious? No Mike Conley, bum ankle Donovan Mitchell having to play his ass off every possession‚Ä¶ are you serious?"
What an embarrassing choke from the Suns. What happened to the one and only Booker who's supposedly better than Donovan Mitchell?
"In hindsight Donovan Mitchell (#13) is starting to look like a challenger for Tatum, probably a close 2nd."

8 months ago you had James Harden. The Detroit Pistons all decade team is Drummond-Griffin-I don't know-I don't know we should have drafted Donovan Mitchell-Jackson. Share the love.

"That's not how they've done* things. People forgetting that there's also a new owner this year.  Honestly, this take was my first impression as well. Jazz thought the risk of losing without Mitchell was small enough to be worth the benefit of getting him a few more days rest, especially because we swept the Grizzlies in the regular season. Obviously they made the wrong bet. Donovan got pissed because he wanted to play because he's a competitor, and got even more pissed when we lost by one possession. But if we win this series, all will be easily forgiven and forgotten."
"He's stuck here.  Donovan Mitchell's contract is about 50% more money than he is worth. The Jazz were cornered into giving it to him, because he is a huge fan favorite. It would take massive draft pick or cash considerations to try to trade him off now.  I don't think he hates Salt Lake nearly as much as players hated it like 10 years ago. The racist lunatics in his social media comments live a county away. In the city, he knows which parks and clubs to go meet other black guys from out of state. He was actually super active in the community before Covid. The night life also got MUCH better here over the last five years.  Mitchell was in fact extremely pissed at Gobert about Covid, but I don't expect it to be an issue going forward. They both know they are stuck together and they want to make the best of it and win some games. There's just nothing to gain by holding grudges right now.  The biggest WTF for me is why their head coach thought it was okay to donate to Burgess Owens last year. I guess we're just hoping Mitchell never hears about it?"
Guess what we worship Donovan Mitchell now
"This is the opposite. Kawhis camp thought the team medics staff were putting him at risk. In this situation the jazz staff are trying to not put him at risk and Mitchell is annoyed. What motive could the jazz have? I think Donovan needs to chill out and realize there‚Äôs no malicious intent here, it‚Äôs the exact opposite. Ankle injuries if they‚Äôre not cared for can haunt you your entire career. There‚Äôs a long list of NBA players that came back too early and were never the same."

I fucking love Donovan Mitchell so much I cannot believe he plays for us
"Turner for a disgruntled Donovan Mitchell. Think of that Gobert/Turner front court it'd be like Duncan/Robinson 2.0! Or Turner for Duncan Robinson. Think of that Bam/Turner front court, so spooky."
"Gobert has had a massive negative on/off the last 3 years in the playoffs. I‚Äôm not crazy about advanced stats but Look at his WS/48 compared to the regular season. Same with his vorp. And his offensive production becomes non existent. People get mad but it‚Äôs true. He‚Äôs a great regular season player, and OK in the playoffs. Donovan Mitchell shows up."
"This guy is either trolling or an idiot.  here's another one  &amp;#x200B;  I spoke to a Jazz rotation player, on the condition on anonymity, and he states he think the team might be better with Mitchell on the bench      ""Donovan is gonna try to score, to get on Sportscenter. With him out, Rudy can really cook and be the D-RTG Swing champ we all know he is"""
Just a small reminder that Donovan Mitchell and Jayson Tatum were the only players on rookie deals who were extended this offseason on a max deal and given a player option for the last year..just file that away in your mental rolodex
"That Jazz series that OKC lost is the OG Playoff P moment, though. Taunting Donovan Mitchell and then getting cooked by him in the last game."
"Lebron : the 2011 finals  Harden : being outplayed by Jonathon Simmons in the 2017 game 6  KD : the game 6 in the 2016 WCF  Westbrook : games 2 trough 4 in the Utah series in 2018  Kawhi : last year's series against Denver  PG : Game 6 against Utah in 2018  Dame : Jrue Holiday nothing else to say  CP3 : the end of the 2014 game 5 against OKC  Steph : the end of the game 7 in 2016  Kyrie : the end of the series vs the Bucks with Boston  Giannis : last year's vs Miami  Donovan Mitchell : the 2019 series vs the Rockets  Unless I forget someone, most guys either haven't played enough in the playoffs or aren't that relevant"
"The twitter guy either is trolling or doing a bit. Here's the follow up tweets rotfl.  Tweet:  It's a dynamic that has been bubbling up over the last few years.  ""Teammates thought Donovan was their best player for a long time... Then they get a chance to see these graphs and record setting D-EPM from Dunks and Threes and they feel betrayed. Like Mitchell stole valor.""  I spoke to a Jazz rotation player, on the condition on anonymity, and he states he think the team might be better with Mitchell on the bench  ""Donovan is gonna try to score, to get on Sportscenter.

"&gt;""Teammates thought Donovan was their best player for a long time... Then they get a chance to see these graphs and record setting D-EPM from Dunks and Threes and they feel betrayed. Like Mitchell stole valor.  What lol"
Nope. Theyre gonna be just fine. Especially if Donovan Mitchell comes back
Jazz Staff: Donovan Mitchell will not be playing tonights game  Rudy Gobert: i sleep
"&gt;idk i think its less likely a conspiracy tho  99.9% of the time, I would agree with you.   However, as a long time Jazz fan that's very familiar with this org, it's players, and how they generally handle situations like this, there is just way too much fuckiness happening to even semi-reasonably conclude that's the case.   The lack of info &amp; communication from the FO, the cryptic &amp; inuendo-filled answers from players in post-game statements, the media lockdown of Donovan Mitchell &amp; all other players not required to be made available post-game by the league, etc....  Literally none of this is normal. And frankly, none of it is at all even remotely necessary, if the truth was simply that the Med Staff legit concluded that Mitchell's ankle was just not quite ready in pre-game walk-throughs."
"I get that the medical staff has a job to do, but if I'm Dennis Lindsey I'm marching down there right now and telling them to let Mitchell do what he wants.  We're a small market and Donovan is a massively marketable star. The chances of losing him to discontent over stuff like this is MUCH higher than the chances of losing him to a broken ankle on Wednesday."
It's Donovan Mitchell offensively and Rudy defensively. Take your pick on what you care about more but I lean toward Donny and offense.
"I had a similar thought when they showed the upcoming schedule with the marquee players next to each team and there was Lebron vs CP3, but then everyone else was part of the new era, Ja vs Donovan Mitchell, Trae vs Randle, etc."
Bruh there was no Donovan Mitchell
I think their playoff impact is worlds apart. Donovan Mitchell is the heart of their entire offense &amp; Gobert literally gets played off of the floor every year.
"Rudy Gobert and Bogdanovic had interesting quotes postgame about Mitchell being out  &gt; [When he woke up from his afternoon nap, Rudy Gobert was surprised to hear that Donovan Mitchell had been ruled out. Gobert: ""I try to stay out of all of this, because it‚Äôs just going to give me a headache. Hopefully, he‚Äôs good for next game. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm worried about.""](https://twitter.com/espn_macmahon/status/1396688754492940289)    &gt; [Bojan Bogdanovic, on Donovan Mitchell: ""Of course we missed him, especially in the playoffs. I don‚Äôt know what happened, honestly, with the medical staff and him, to hold him out. You should ask him.""](https://twitter.com/tribjazz/status/1396688463286648840)"
"You mean having the best drop defensive big in the league gives up the midrange? Come on man‚Ä¶ donovan Mitchell comes back, jazz in 6. Chalk."
Donovan Mitchell.  He is promising.   Luke Kennard only promised to keep us bang average.
I could name about 22 guys fairly easily. Once you get to like Donovan Mitchell and jaylen brown it‚Äôs a toss up.
Donovan Mitchell came onto the floor earlier this game too and tried to pick a fight with Kyle. Jazz just be extra like that
Today showed us that even good teams really can‚Äôt win without their second best player.  It sucks that the Jazz are missing Donovan Mitchell and the Lakers were missing AD.
They won because Donovan Mitchell didn‚Äôt play
"So one game by Dbook and Trae proves that they are better than Donovan Mitchell(dripped 50+ bombs in the playoffs and eliminated OKC big 3 as a rookie) and Tatum (took Lebron to 7 games as rookies when many ppl expected the celtics to lose in the 1st or 2nd round, plays great defense, took them to the ECF last year as well with Hayward being injured) who have led their teams deep into the playoffs. Damn, u have a great argument! You are comparing Booker and Trae to one of the greatest players of all time. The thing with MJ is he was a two player and was dominating the playoffs even if he lost. Nobody on their team couldn't guard him thats why Bird referred to MJ as "" a god"". Yeah, we can clearly see who needs to sit this one out."
"""*You‚Äôve got to understand, just like in video games growing up, we never played with Utah. As great as Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert was, we would never pick those guys in video games.*"" - LeBron James"
Fake 1 seed? They were missing Donovan Mitchell and they are a fake 1 seed after 1 game. Were the Lakers a fake 1 seed after losing against Portland last year?
Donovan Mitchell suddenly feeling alot better
"Embiid doesnt flop for his calls, yeah he sometimes does it when plyers shove him like Donovan Mitchell and Andre Drummond but he doesnt really flop in the post he mostly just takes advantages of defenders reaching or having poor position"
The Jazz are 8-37 from 3 and still within 10 points. All while not having Donovan Mitchell. Lots of people under-estimating the hell out of the Jazz.   I‚Äôve seen the Grizz blow way too many close games in the final couple minutes this year to be comfortable right now.
"No way Donovan Mitchell isn‚Äôt back next game, right?"
"Losing a series is better than losing Donovan Mitchell. Don't know how bad his ankle is right now, but they have to put his health first, no matter how frustrating it may be."
Did Donovan Mitchell quit on the jazz? Wasup?
No Donovan Mitchell tonight. Grizzlies feasting.
"I dont hate the Jazz roster but I'm still surprised at their seeding. With Donovan out their roster, to me, looks like a squad that would compete for a play-in spot. Guess that's telling of how good Snyder is as a coach. I triple checked their roster to make sure I didn't overlook anyone and nah, this team is badly fucked without Mitchell"
Keep in mind Jazz do not have Donovan Mitchell and we could not guard him in our head-to-head in the regular season. But this is still promising for us.
"Memphis is great, don't get me wrong, but Jazz need Donovan Mitchell badly"
Utah is really screwed without Donovan Mitchell
Unfortunately ‚Äúfourth quarter Jazz‚Äù is largely a Donovan Mitchell special so I‚Äôm a little nervous
What's the deal with Donovan Mitchell?
Well you are a fool to think they are just letting Donovan rest. He has missed 17 games now and they were in a race for the first seed. It's ignorant to say that they are overlooking them and just giving Mitchell more time off. If anything the longer he sits the more rust he has to shake off. They'd live to have him in every game they can before the next round.
Dillon Brooks is pissed off he didn't get to guard Donovan Mitchell. He's taking it out on the rest of your team.
Ah yes Donovan Mitchell = Curry
Has Donovan Mitchell been at practice or shoot arounds?  Just curious how close he is to coming back.
not like donovan Mitchell is playing lol
"One team has KD, kyrie and harden. The other has Donovan mitchell, Conley and Ingles lol. The Nets are on a different tier."
only thing Jazz are missing is a deliberate midgame/driver... Donovan Mitchell healthy could easily make this team a slight variation of of 2015 dubs
The Jazz desperately need Donovan Mitchell. The offense is looking really weak RN.
"Here's the deal, Donovan Mitchell gets the sportscenter highlights and all the cool shots. But the real MVP of this team is Rudy gobert. When he is on the floor, the opposing offense has to adjust majorly in his presence. He is the best player on this team"
Donovan Mitchell will make them a completely different team
Donovan Mitchell walks like a teacher
"Lol, he might have felt like ""the kid without"" bcz his family was a ""top 10% income"" family living &amp; attending schools in a ""top 1% income"" community.   And I'm sure that his Dad was gone almost all the time with work/travel. You don't make a career &amp; become an executive in a MLB front office without putting in crazy hours.  So I'm sure his mom did the bulk of the ""hands-on"" parenting, and it's reasonable to expect that it put a lot of stress on their marriage &amp; his relationship with his children.   But nothing about any of that is abnormal for 99% of marriages in any socioeconomic class, and virtually all fathers with highly successful careers in this country struggle to be present as much as would be ideal.   And even so, Donovan has also spoken at length about the time he spent around the Mets org &amp; the relationships he had with many of the players. So obviously his Dad was present &amp; involved with him throughout his childhood. And if you've followed him closely enough to have read the stories you mentioned, one can only assume you've also read about his childhood experiences his Dad provided with the Mets.  Bottom line is that Mitchell had it great growing up. Everybody has their challenges in childhood, but to say or imply he had some sort of hardscrabble back-story is bullshit. He straight had it better that most kids in pretty much every meaningful way, and for you to paint it as a ""rough"" childhood with an absent father does smack of ignorance, &amp; deference to common racial stereotypes in our society &amp; sports landscape.   So if you're offended by me saying your comment was ""low-key racist"", maybe look in the mirror &amp; ask yourself why the Donovan Mitchell backstory/narrative you've built in your mind is the one that unfairly paints his childhood as economically ""underprivileged"", &amp; with an absentee father???"
Yeah but he was amazing throughout the playoffs. I would go as far to say he is just as good if not better than Donovan Mitchell.
This article says he said he is ready. https://www.deseret.com/platform/amp/2021/5/23/22445622/donovan-mitchell-im-ready-to-go-ahead-of-game-1-utah-jazz-vs-memphis-grizzlies-nba-playoffs
The pistons were projected to draft Donovan Mitchell but they took Kennard
"Not sure about.. Donovan Mitchell against Brooks averaged 35ppg, 6.5 apg on 60% FG and 71% on 3s. Ja did well against Royce fwiw 27 ppg, 7 apg on 51% FG and 41% 3s."
Donovan Mitchell...
&gt;Will Donovan  a combination of Will Barton and Donovan Mitchell
You think they would suspend Donovan Mitchell?
Is Donovan Mitchell playing?
"Giannis, Donovan Mitchell, Kawhi, Dame, LeBron"
"Funny how everyone on this sub forgets Donovan Mitchell. Well, they can‚Äôt be blamed; the NBA‚Äôs own site doesn‚Äôt even have a tab for ‚Äúyoung stars‚Äù for him, whilst they‚Äôre able to put one up of Bam and Herro. All the players they highlight are really good, but leaving off Mitchell, when Booker is there (who has two more seasons of experience than Don) is an absolute insult and pretty despicable example of media blacking out Jazz coverage. Another example, if the Jazz had beat the Dubs in the same type of game, I seriously doubt they‚Äôd get more than a small fraction of the love Ja and the Grizz are getting on their site this AM. Another example is them not getting ‚Äúdeeper dive‚Äù game play analysis, when they‚Äôre one of the greatest ball movement teams to exist in a long time. I think they‚Äôre probably the best ever, but that‚Äôs my bias likely speaking.   Point is, the Jazz are amazing, and I can‚Äôt wait until that veil is finally forced to be lifted. Pardon the language‚ÄîSilver and Co. can fuck themselves"
"Obviously I'd love to finally see Phila win a chmapionship this year but as long as the Lakers and Nets don't win this year I'll be okay with the result.     Also: Maybe add Utah to that list as well because fuck Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert, but the rest of the team ain't so cool as well."
"He always talks shit to Mitchell and then Mitchell goes nuclear on him. He really struggles guarding him 1 on 1, but Grizzlies can't afford to double or trap Donovan with all the shooters the Jazz have so expect them to live with it."
he will lockdown donovan mitchell
"Donovan Mitchell had a stand out series and people still question whether he has ""it."""
"Donovan Mitchell went 7-9, maybe bad news for the first round"
"Yes, Donovan Mitchell did that all by himself and is fully responsible. That's why Kobe Bryant is the worst player of all time, because he lost a 3-1 lead"
"Doesn't matter, Donovan Mitchell already proved he's the best player of all time last playoffs"
Untrue. Jazz have had Donovan Mitchell out for a minute. Suns had Booker hurt for a month. Lakers had ADisney ;) and LeBron both out. Embiid was hurt for a long while. None of those without their stars would have been a 12 win team. None went 1-8 without their best player
"Grizzlies could have the most difficult finals run of all time, having to go through Steph Curry, Donovan Mitchell + Rudy Gobert, Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, Lebron James and Anthony Davis, to meet up against potentially James Harden, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant.  The West is fucking nuts."
Donovan Mitchell esque
Yeah because that precedent that was set by Rudy Gobert not following protocol and getting sued for getting Donovan Mitchell sick. Sure buddy
"donovan mitchell is sitting at home smiling his ass off, he prob doesnt even need to play the first round watching these 2 teams play tonight"
"For that reason I prefer to think about it in tiers.  Tier 1 (No particular order): Dame, LeBron, Kawhi, Luka, Jokic, Steph, AD, Harden, KD, Embiid, Giannis, Beal.  Tier 2: CP3, PG, Kyrie, Klay (if healthy), Lavine, Randle, Tatum, J. Brown, Jimmy Butler, Trae, KAT, Donovan Mitchell, DBook.  Tier 3: Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, Bam Adebayo, Siakim, Ja Morant, Vucevic, CJ McCollum, Jamal Murray,.....etc. You get the picture.  Tier 4 is essentially good role players with tier 5 being good bench players and tier 6 being situational guys and backups."
My team literally drafted the worst bust in the top 10 twice in a row. We missed out on Donovan Mitchell and drafted frank. We drafted Knox and missed out on MPJ and SGA
High-Tier Superstar - Lebron James   Low-Tier Superstar - Damian Lillard   Star - Donovan Mitchell  Rising Star - Anthony Edwards
"prime D-Wade was INCREDIBLE on both ends of the court.  Explosive, skilled, physical &amp; mentally tough.  Look at his 08-09 stat line: 30.2/5/7.5/2.2/1.3, just an insane all around season for a player of his size.  He made 1st team All-NBA &amp; 2nd team All-Defense (should've been 1st team All-Defense over Kobe that year, Wade averaged significantly more steals, blocks &amp; had a better DRtg on a much worse team) lead the NBA in PPG that season, had a 36.2% USG rate, played 38.6 minutes every night and willed an otherwise shitty Miami team to a winning record.  There was nobody like him in the NBA at the time and there's nobody like him today in terms of a 2-way slashing player.  People say Donovan Mitchell today but they're much different, Wade was much better going to the rim &amp; drawing contact, he averaged almost 10 FTA/game in 08-09 at a much slower pace of play, if you look per-100 possessions Wade was between 13-14 FTA/game which is Harden territory."
"If Dillon Brooks shuts down Steph enough for the Grizz to win tonight, I can see him having enough confidence to present problems to the fluidity of the Jazz offense if he is hounding Donovan Mitchell. Being able to push around the undersized Jazz guards is key."
Anthony Edwards and Donovan Mitchell
Donovan Mitchell is probably the closest to him for a comparison
"Thats just a flat out lie, Lamelo had around 20 great games while Edwards had nearly 40 great games putting up Donovan Mitchell numbers."
"ü§î  I think you can make the same argument with steph and Draymond for this year.  You wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúhard to argue for Steph‚Ä¶when Draymond is most valuable.‚Äù Hard to imagine Steph making the playoffs despite his amazing offensive performance WITHOUT Draymond DPOY esque year. I mean, if they squeezed in as 8th seed with Curry being MVP and scoring leader, there‚Äôs a valid argument that Draymond is ‚Äúmore‚Äù valuable because without his defense, they‚Äôd lose more games‚Ä¶in theory‚Ä¶  For the record, I don‚Äôt think Draymond is more valuable. Just a dumb devil‚Äôs advocate counter point.  What I‚Äôm saying is, I get what OP is trying to say and even what you‚Äôre trying to say‚Äîbut I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs worded correctly.  For example. I actually DO think Donovan is more valuable to Utah than Rudy simply because scoring is a lot more important than defense in basketball. That‚Äôs just the nature of the sport.  Donovan carries the offensive load while Rudy anchors the defense. But ultimately one is more valuable to the outcome of the sport. You take Mitchell out the line up for the entire course of the season and make Rudy your primary player and it‚Äôs hard to imagine him carrying a team, let alone being in the MVP race.  That said, I think Rudy is incredibly important to Utah‚Äôs success. Almost every team has a valuable player and an important ‚Äúx factor‚Äù player.  Utah doesn‚Äôt succeed without rudy as much as warriors don‚Äôt succeed without Klay. Both are extremely important to the teams success. But it‚Äôs evident who is the best/valuable player to the franchise."
"I don‚Äôt think Donovan Mitchell ever becomes a superstar in Snyder‚Äôs system.  The offense is too egalitarian and looks for open 3‚Äôs.  If he were in a 90‚Äôs offense he‚Äôd have a lot of practice scoring 25 a game in something iso heavy, but it‚Äôs just not needed from him.  If he can score 30+ in big playoff games on slightly more minutes at will, he can score 25 consistently in the regular season.  If he wins a championship I doubt he‚Äôll be concerned with whether Shaq thinks he‚Äôs a superstar or not, lol."
"I would just turn on the TV and see which teams you like to watch. After that I believe there‚Äôs a database somewhere not sure of the link but you can look up some players.  Here‚Äôs a couple I would HIGHLY recommend watching because they are all stars and all time greats at the moment 1) LeBron James and the Lakers 2) Steph Curry and the Warriors(they will make a comeback next year) 3) Kevin Durant + Kyrie on the Nets 4) Giannis Antetokoumpo and the Bucks(he‚Äôs just fun to watch dunking too lol) 5) Some extra all stars - Westbrook, Beal, Jokic, Embid, Simmons, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell  Anyhow those are some all stars the first 3 points are hall of fame level (except Kyrie), then you can learn about each player on your favorite team.  Hope that helped"
"Dame, Luka, Lebron, AD  Those are all superstars who played in more total games and more meaningful games down the stretch of the season because of the play in. Their presence in those games meant more eyes on the game, and more fans in the stands, than had they not been playing. That is a fact.  Last year, Jokic, Murray, Harden, Westbrook, Chris Paul, Donovan Mitchell, and Luka would have all played in more games and more meaningful games down the stretch. If you don‚Äôt think that those guys playing draws more fans from their markets to go to and watch games, as opposed to them not playing, then I can‚Äôt really argue with you. Because you‚Äôre fundamentally wrong."
"I am aware that people score on him, but that was a close game getting late in the 4th quarter, and a stop would've put Utah in a much better position, and it was on a shot that wasn't really that hard to defend compared to many shots that he does defend easily, that's the point. And the crazy lay's were crazy because the amount of finesse and agility required to make them was very high and done perfectly by a player who was not seen as an amazing player prior t on that time. Mario Hezonja was able to stop LeBron James rather easily, but Gobert can't stop Murray, people make mistakes which I get, but of all the times he doesn't make mistakes, the one time he does it was not ideal. Another part of the reason is the fact that I'm a heat fan and will always try to argue that Bam is better than him, and the final reason is that I love Donovan Mitchell and to see them lose because his best teammate cant do what he does best once made me irate"
Hard to argue for Donovan Mitchell when he's not even the most valuable on his team.
Wow... Kenny said Donovan Mitchell should be up there. I do not think anyone has said that all season.
Donovan Mitchell ü§£
Ideally yeah he'd be the 3rd guy but with the current roster he's the only guy with the upside to be a potential star. You guys are too good with this group to ever get a good lottery pick so unless you strike gold with like an MPJ or Donovan Mitchell in the middle of the first round it's tough to see getting that second guy. I hope you do tho cause the Grizzlies are super fun and play so hard that if they get one more star level player they already have Ja and a good group of young role players to go with him that they'd really be tough.
"Adjusting for pace is a funny thing. Donovan Mitchell is scoring more points per possession than Wilt Chamberlain did in his 50 point per game season. We can't just assume that if the Jazz had more possessions, Donovan would automatically score 50+ every game. This goes the other way around too."
Gasol was the best player for the Lakers in those championships. Saying otherwise is like saying Donovan Mitchell is the best player on the Jazz.
"Will the fact that they don't have what I would call a superstar definitely hurts, the fact that they blew a 3-1 lead last year definitely hurts and the fact that Donovan Mitchell is coming back from injury so he's probably going to be a little bit Rusty, Utah is obviously a good team but look what's happening with the odds in the Lakers versus Phoenix series it ain't just the Jazz lol, the Lakers and Clippers are the only teams that people are buying out of the West"
because rudy gobert and donovan mitchell are over-rated
I better not see anymore dumbass Jazz fans claiming Rudy Gobert is their best and most valuable player. It's time Donovan Mitchell gets the respect he deserves.
"&gt;  A lot of players are capable passers, but for someone like Mitchell, you need to be a great passer and playmaker if he's not going to impact the game on defense.  So the new rule is that you have to be a great passer and playmaker but those rules don't apply if you're good on defense.  That... doesn't really track.    &gt;When AD commands the ball in the post, he's controlling the pace of the game.   This... doesn't really mean anything.  When Mitchell (or Lavine or Book or Trae) have the ball and are preparing to attack they're controlling the pace of the game. And notice here that, again, you're avoiding the question of passing, playmaking, etc.    You seem to think it's a matter of ticking enough boxes.  I think every player has to be evaluated individually.    &gt;Donovan Mitchell torching bad defenses isn't him taking over when shit hits the fan.   Which is pretty ignorant of what he's actually done, and what he's actually capable of.  If all he'd done was 'torch bad defenses' he wouldn't be in this conversation.    &gt;In the 2 other series against Houston Mitchell played poorly because of Houstons switching defense.   He played poorly because there were no other offensive weapons on that Jazz team.  Everyone on the team shot like shit, and he was doubled pretty much nonstop IIRC (which by your criteria would be a point in his favor).    All that said, players don't remain the same all throughout their careers.  He's gotten better from his rookie year (which is when the first of those series happened), and I've no idea why you've arbitrarily decided to exclude the Grizzlies series, which is the closest full series representation of who he is as a player right now.  No one's arguing he was a superstar as a rookie, we're talking right now.  And given that he's substantially improved I think that's a valid distinction to make.    Again, I feel it's all subjective, and that trying to put fixed criteria on who is and isn't a superstar isn't really ever going to work.  But I do think you and I will have to agree to disagree on this."
"You need to be more than just a capable passer. A lot of players are capable passers, but for someone like Mitchell, you need to be a great passer and playmaker if he's not going to impact the game on defense.  When AD commands the ball in the post, he's controlling the pace of the game. He can be a matchup nightmare. But he impacts the game both offensively and defensively at an elite level.   Donovan Mitchell torching bad defenses isn't him taking over when shit hits the fan. Prior to this playoffs, he had 2 good playoff series and 2 bad playoff series. The 2 good playoff series came against teams with bigs that aren't good at defending the PnR, who utilize drop coverage (Adams and Jokic). In the 2 other series against Houston Mitchell played poorly because of Houstons switching defense. No superstar averages 19 and 21 ppg on 34% FG and 25% 3 PT against a Houston defense that lacked superb elite perimeter defenders. We give him a pass for being the lone offensive creator, but it doesn't mean he's a superstar. Contrast this to Luka Doncic who absolutely destroyed a Clippers defense that is most geared to defend players like him. There's your difference."
"Imagine thinking putting the guy who was ""too fucking small"" for Luka, on Donovan Mitchell, is a winning strategy LMAO"
"Donovan ""Don't Call Me 'Donovan ""Donovan Mitchell"" Mitchell' Mitchell"
"&gt;Gobert sets the floor for this team  What floor is he setting? Not being able to beat the Grizzlies without Mitchell? Offense is clearly more important than defense in the NBA in this era. Gobert is a good player, but the Jazz will go as far as Donovan takes them, which I think he can lead them to the Finals."
Gobert has clearly been the better player so far although Don has a higher ceiling. There‚Äôs really no debating it at this point. If Donovan continues his incredible playoff run  through this season I think the argument could be made that his game transforms him into the more impactful playoff performer. But your argument about only reading the playoffs with Donovan is laughable because in the regular season especially Gobert &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mitchell.   Nice incredibly biased and Cherry-picked post though üòÇ.
Let‚Äôs also be reminded that the Pistons drafted Kennard right before Donovan Mitchell and Bam Adebayo was selected.
Always felt Donovan Mitchell could actually be that player to have what it takes to be an even better version of DWade.  I didn‚Äôt realize this would be one way it ends up happening.  Happy for all sides to be honest.
"I don't get how players like Donovan Mitchell, Tatum, and Booker are not considered superstars when they are winning and in Tatum and Donovan's case, have been extremely successful in the playoffs despite being young, but people are out here promoting Luka to superstar even tho he has yet to win a playoff series and I know his stats are nice, but why can't people be consistent with this part. What matters more, stats or winning."
are we talking about donovan mitchell enough?
I thought Donovan Mitchell scoring 40+ was a bubble fluke guys. Another blow against bubble truthers
Off topic. D Wade is fucking crazy. He is like a supercharged Donovan Mitchell. No wonder he gets lots of FTs.
"Jeezus the people in the game thread talking about how bad Donovan was, or how watching a Donovan Mitchell-lead team was painful..."
"Luka is already 1st team all nba in his 2nd season, is the most important player on a playoff team(Rudy Gobert and Mitchell is debatable to who is more valuable for the jazz) . Just had a playoff series nearly averaging a 30+ pt tripled double. If you replace Luka with Donavan rn Jazz are in the same tier of team as the Brooklyn nets. No one is taking Donovan over Luka fan, player, gm whatever."
Fun fact for you on that note: Conley's season highs for the past two seasons have both been against the Clippers. I thought he was our key to beating them and that without him we were in trouble. Then that first half did nothing to dissuade me.   But then Donovan Mitchell decided he was done with that nonsense.
"Yep, Paul George gave [this infamous press conference before Game 1 of that series,](https://youtu.be/EBcKrWEercc?t=5s) where he crowned himself ""Playoff P"" and said he was going to shut down Donovan Mitchell."
"Rank them however you want, hes still not a superstar. Booker and Tatum aren't superstars. Neither is Donovan Mitchell."
"Boggles my mind then, and still boggles my mind now when a majority of dudes on here called Donovan Mitchell overrated in a thread a few months ago about the ""most overrated player in the league""."
Do you think Donovan Mitchell is a top 10 player in the league rn
Donovan ‚ÄúDonovan ‚ÄòSpida‚Äô Mitchell‚Äù Mitchell
"Donovan Mitchell is way better that you think he is,  and Rudy Gobert is the best Jazz player."
"But he sucks ass at doing it right. He tried to do that with Donovan, but, idk if he just fumbled the words, but it sounded like he wanted to drag Mitchell on national TV."
"No he is not lol. Donovan Mitchell has proved 2 years in a row in the Playoffs now that he's by far the best player on the Jazz. idc how many advanced stats you bring or whatever Jazz fans say, Mitchell raises his level in the playoffs while Rudy stays the same/regresses a little. He is much more important in the playoffs than Gobert is"
"Was this a real take that was just edited to say ""Donovan Mitchell please fugg my ass"" because the replies are really confusing and funny lol"
"game 1 of last series was missing 1 jazz player, his name is donovan mitchell   he seems like a difference maker, no disrespect to captain mike"
Am I to take this to mean that Donovan Mitchell is good at basketball?

Donovan Mitchell is a bad man
Donovan mitchell is my father
This is going to be a great series. Going 6 or 7. Expecting a couple signature Donovan Mitchell and Kawhi guys
Donovan Mitchell is a great scorer but also has great intangibles. He plays with so much heart and is an amazing leader. Everytime you heard him Miced up his words were spot on and exactly what his team needed. I really think his leadership made a big difference in this game.
"That was so much fun! I want 3 more games of that please, Donovan Mitchell is the real deal."
I love Donovan Mitchell
What is the paper Donovan Mitchell holding during the end game interview?

Donovan Mitchell already tied with Malone in his 4th year. This is crazy.

"This is actually what they want and how you neutralize Rudy Gobert, you play small ball with five shooters because he is incapable of punishing you on offense.  Jackson-PG-Kawhi-Morris-Batum with everyone spread out is what the Clippers absolutely want to do, not only it forces Gobert into guarding a 3-PT shooter, but also gives LA absurd shooting while being solid defensively, the only reason this lineup hasn't worked so far is because Marcus Morris is shooting 7% from three and Kawhi has been way below average.  Donovan Mitchell is also averaging 41.0 ppg, which is absolutely unsustainable, but let's not even mention that."
"""donovan mitchell is playing better than you"""
man devin booker vs donovan mitchell in the wcf could be legendary shit with how they‚Äôve both been playing in these playoffs
I fucking love Donovan Mitchell. Him and Booker
"Quick Run down:  NBA essentially set into motion the initial NA lockdown of covid-19 after Gobert (Jazz Center) tested positive. The season was delayed until late July where the NBA setup a Bubble in Orlando, Florida with 22-23(?) teams. Essentially all the teams within playoff contention. They played 8 games in the bubble and then the play-in games commenced for the 8/9 seeds. In this case it was Portland/Memphis, as they were within 4 games of each other, with Portland winning and claiming the 8 seed. The only 2 noteworthy points during the pre-playoff bubble was the Suns 8-0 perfect run as they missed the play-in games by a single game, and Damian Lillard going absolutely nuclear. The Bubble playoffs were interesting as all playoffs go.   Donovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray went toe-to-toe in the first round, with the Nugs edging out the Jazz in 7.  The Chris Paul led OKC Thunder took Houston with Westbrook and Harden to 7, and nearly took it. Harden had a game saving block on Lu Dort to move on to the 2nd round.  Aside from that the first round was fairly boring.  In the second round the 5th seeded Heat surprised everyone and knocked out the Giannis led bucks in 5.   Boston and Toronto went to 7, with Boston taking it in the end.  The Clippers blew a 3-1 lead over the Nuggets.  Conference Finals ended up being fairly easy for both winners, as the Lakers won in 5 over Denver, and the Heat won in 6 over Boston.  In the Finals, the Lakers took it in 6 over the Heat.  That‚Äôs the rundown for last season‚Äôs end/playoffs. You could probably piece this season together through the almanac and other articles. Hope I could help, and welcome back!"
"‚ÄúThe west was the weakest it‚Äôs been in a long time‚Äù  We just gonna ignore how great the Jazz, Nuggets and Clippers were prior to the Bubble? Let alone the insane play of Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker and Jamal Murray IN the Bubble?"
"Man, I can't imagine a list that has Boozer over Donovan Mitchell. Mitchell's peak *so far* is already much higher than anything I've seen from Boozer."
&gt; The more I see and hear about Donovan Mitchell the more I like him.   I've been butthurt for the longest time because we passed on him in favor of Luke Kennard but the man is brilliant. Can't help but respect what he's doing right now.
"Mark Eaton, Adrian Dantley, Pete Maravich, Jeff Hornacek are some of our other greats, but I'm not sure I'd choose any of those over Gobert and Mitchell. Mitchell has such a passionate, wholesome drive to win every single game he plays. He leaves it all out there *every time.* And it's no exaggeration to say that Gobert defines the team. This team would not work without him keeping the paint locked down for everyone else to focus on perimeter defense and individual match-ups.   Literally the only reason I would hesitate to put Rudy and Donovan in the same echelon as Stockton and Malone is because they're young, and the latter pair had incredible longevity. But Mitchell and Gobert keep playing this way, they'll have their jerseys up in the rafters in no time. It's great time to be a Jazz fan."
A Donovan Mitchell finals MVP would be cool asf
"When I first saw this I was like ‚Äúwtf kind of question is this‚Äù, obviously Donovan Mitchell is better than Paul George.  Why would anyone ask such a question?"
And Donovan Mitchell is upset
Tatum. I think Donovan Mitchell has a really good shot to prove himself in the WCF and maybe even finals.
Bruh Donovan Mitchell outplayed Westbrook and Paul George his rookie year in the playoffs and sent them home
Nobody will be talking about it 2 years from now  Donovan Mitchell having the third most points **ever** in a playoff game will actually go down in history
"Jazz had a defensive rating of 97.2 last night with gobert on the floor.  With him off, defensive rating of 169.6.   The second gobert sat, clippers erased a 21 point Jazz lead  Additionally his On-Off +/- per 100 possessions is a +23.6 so far these playoffs in 232 minutes.  It‚Äôs pretty safe to safe he‚Äôs extremely important to our winning, as is (obviously) Donovan Mitchell"
"Cool nobody cares about the regular season. And that totally carried over to the playoffs when they lost to the 8 seed the 1 game Donovan missed right?  Btw of their 13 wins without Mitchell this season, 2 were against the Kings, 1 was against the Thunder, 2 were against the Rockets, 1 was against the tanking raptors, 2 were against the spurs, and 1 was against the lakers with no LeBron or AD.  So 70% of those regular season wins that you're using as proof were against completely garbage teams üëç"
"Reminder that the Jazz lost to the 8 seed during the only playoff game that Donovan Mitchell didn't play, and are 6-0 since he came back. Oh and Mitchell is averaging 33 PPG on 62% TS.  The fact that this post is not instantly mass downvoted shows how insanely overrated Gobert is in here. Gobert is not close to top 12 best, most impactful, whatever you want to say. He's not even the most impactful player on the Jazz"
"Your comment reminds me of what Donovan Mitchell said. He used to go up and slam it quite a bit, he said he stopped that mentality to preserve his knees as he began to notice how hard it was on them slamming it down a few times a game. Although he will still dunk from time to time it's not near as much as he used to."
saying donovan mitchell is utahs all-time best player when jeff hornacek suited up for them is a fucking disgrace.
"Donovan Mitchell, guy seems like the biggest scumbag in all his interviews"
Paul George quite literally has 0 playoff 40 point games.   He‚Äôs gotten over 30 points in the playoffs 5 times over the last 3 post seasons. This is over 27 games I think.   Donovan Mitchell has scored over 30 points 4 times this playoff run. He‚Äôs played 6 games.
Donovan Mitchell
I mean if hired personal employees can storm the court players should start hiring whole armies of body guards. Imagine Patrick Beverly pushing Donovan Mitchell then 25 body guards pile out onto the court to harass pbev
Stephen A came in blazing hot today: ‚ÄúDonovan Mitchell is the best player in Utah Jazz franchise history.‚Äù
"The Clippers have a clear strategy, which is have Gobert defend a shooter and drive, which will either create an open layup or an open three pointer.  Clippers biggest problem right now is that Marcus Morris, a 47% 3-PT shooter in the regular season, is shooting 7% from 3, also it doesn't help that Kawhi has been below average in the first two games.  I feel like people are reading too much out of two games in which Morris and Kawhi have struggled and Donovan Mitchell has averaged 41.0 PPG, all of those things aren't sustainable."
"Stephen A on a role today: Donovan Mitchell is the best player in Jazz history, white coaches should no longer get head coaching opportunities and now the Clippers should refuse to re-sign Kawhi if he wants to come back."
"Yeah, Middleton was good in game 3. The offense as a whole still sucked and has the same problems it always does.  1. Giannis can't shoot beyond 5'  2. Middleton is awesome, but he's being overextended because nobody else on Milwaukee can get a shot. He's Paul George but they are asking him to be Kawhi.   3. Holiday doesn't create enough either.   -  All 3 of those guys are between really good and superstars, but they don't fit together that well. Giannis desperately needs a playmaking guard around him (think CP3, Donovan Mitchell, etc) and the Bucks don't have it."
"I think you're absolutely wrong to assume that it's as simple as ""more scoring."" Because there is no way the average viewer likes to see three free throws in a row.  When average fans want to see more scoring, they want to see Steph Curry and Klay Thompson hit a million 3s. They want to see Donovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray duking it out in the playoffs with record numbers of 50 point games.  The average NBA viewer does not want to watch Marcus Morris fall on his ass on purpose and then take three free throws in a row.  It's horrible television."
"I mean Donovan was a rookie, he's not anymore, just for starters.  Watch the Jazz play the Clippers, who are a better team than the Bucks. They have completely removed the pick and roll as an option for the Clippers. That is a very difficult task to accomplish. Do the Nets have a roll man as good as Capela was? This isn't the same team as 2 years ago.  But, the big difference is offense. Jazz lost to the Rockets in the manner they did because the Rockets could blanket Mitchell and dare the Jazz to shoot over them. Rubio and Crowder could not do that. Now the jazz have like 6 guys who can shoot over 40% on catch and shoot threes, many of them much better than that. Pretty much anybody on the floor other than Gobert and Favors.  The biggest thing is that the Nets will have to defend a bit, because the Jazz, and the Suns for that matter, can keep up with the Nets offensively. They just aren't going to show up and outscore the Jazz or Suns. Nets aren't going to be ""switching everything"" like the Rockets did. They just aren't built like that."
"Players on this list who were also in the top 10 for 3P% during those playoffs: Donovan Mitchell (6th), Jason Terry (4th), Ray Allen (3rd), Jason Richardson (5th), Kirk Hinrich (5th)"
I don‚Äôt think Donovan Mitchell would do better than what the Giannis is doing with the bucks but I‚Äôd still take this Donovan Mitchell over Giannis in the playoffs
"&gt;Current Donovan Mitchell is better than Prime D Wade  as a resident D-Wade hater, I still gotta disagree with this. Lets see Mitchell at least lead his team to a Finals before we start putting him above all-timers"
The more I see and hear about Donovan Mitchell the more I like him.
&gt; ‚ÄúCurrent Donovan Mitchell is better than Prime D Wade‚Äù  Takes like this show when someone started following the NBA.
Donovan Mitchell will probably not continue to outperform his regular season stats in the playoffs.
The worst part of yesterday‚Äôs broadcast for Kennard was when the announcers casually mentioned that Mitchell was picked right after him in the draft as Donovan was just slicing apart the Clippers in the fourth. Followed by a long pause with the subtitled bit reading ‚Äúlmao he sucks.‚Äù  I‚Äôm not sure what the guy has done to deserve all the slander but people really seem to love to lay into him.
Donovan Mitchell is BUILT different
The Donovan Mitchell effect
Donovan mitchell
"Whoa whoa whoa this is outrageous. Completely underrating Donovan Mitchell, who isn't just the greatest ever Jazz player, he's literally the greatest player of all-time. Upvote me if you like pizza."
"So Ty Lue *finally* found the right rotation and guys to play in Games 6+7 in that Mavs series (benched Beverley and Rondo, played Mann more and gave Kennard some spot minutes) and literally decides to go away from it in the first 2 games of this series.   I understand the desire to play Zubac more as you can't go small for the full 48 and guys will wear down, esp Batum who is probably going to be gassed at the end of this playoffs, but the guard rotation is inexplicable.   Here are the things T-Lue needs to do with his rotations:  1. Start Batum, put Marcus Morris on the bench, Morris's 3s aren't falling right now and his scoring is better served off the bench when Kawhi + PG aren't playing. Kawhi + PG + Batum have an amazing +/- when they are on the floor together.   2. Bench Pat Bev and play Terance Mann more. Mann gives you exactly what you think Pat Bev is giving you, and the fact that Bev can't make shots anymore drastically reduces his value on the court, the Jazz don't respect him at all and don't guard him. Yeah Mann isn't a great shooter, but he can slash to the rim, he cuts, he puts pressure on the rim, which the Clips need to do to get the Jazz in rotation for those 3s they get off of movement, which is what they do when they're at their best.   3. Play Luke Kennard every second that Donovan Mitchell is not on the floor. He may already be doing this, but I would really make a point of emphasis on doing this, Kennard's shooting is invaluable right now for a team that is struggling to shoot 3s.   4. Like Kennard, Boogie should be out there in every second that Mitchell is not on the floor, he provides useful spacing whilst also being a rim deterrent, and he can also mash Favors in the post when he is out there.   Overall the minutes leaderboard for the Clips should look like this:   1. PG (it's far easier for him to play 40+ minutes than it is for Kawhi who needs more rest)  2. Kawhi  3. Batum (this might exhaust him, but you're going to lose if he doesn't play more minutes)  4. Reggie   5. Mook  6. Mann  7. Kennard  8. Zubac  9. Boogie"
"Impressive game by Bojan, but tbh for me the story is how much the Clippers struggle to guard scoring guards, their lack of interior defense really hurts Kawhi and PG's ability to guard Donovan. They have played four playoff series with this roster, in all four of them they have been lit up by a dynamic scoring guard in the other side.  Marcus Morris is also in a absurd slump, 1-14 from 3 in this series so far and only two good playoff games out of nine played. I honestly don't think that the Clippers have played well in either of those two games, Morris has been awful, Kawhi has been below average and Pat Bev has been unplayable, it will be interesting to see how this series change if one or two of those factors change.  Props to the Jazz though, Donovan Mitchell is making a case for being a Top 10 player in the league and their shooting ability is in full display, but this definitely feel like a series that will go to a Game 7."
It's actually Donovan Mitchell.
I‚Äôm not a fan of either team nor player and that definitely was a dirty play from Paul George at the end of a game that was already over. He clearly tripped Donovan Mitchell
6‚Äô10 Donovan mitchell
Yeah. It looked like they tried to get him in the game anytime Mitchell was heading to the bench. It makes sense with the shellacking Donovan gave him last game but definitely limited his impact in scoring.
Reggie was in a lose lose by that point. Either Donovan Mitchell or Ingles is left wide open
"When a breakdown happens, just look for the guy covering nobody. This is 100% on Beverley. Jackson had to leave either Donovan freakin Mitchell, or Ingles, wide open"
"Why would every disadvantage not also apply to the Lakers?  And what's your source for your claim that everyone was checked out? *Plenty* of players seemed like the exact opposite, like they were totally locked in. See: Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell, Jimmy Butler, Anthony Davis, Lebron James, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Devin Booker, Nikola Jokic, etc  Like it honestly seems like you completely just pulled that out of your ass because one or two players voiced their struggles, no offense"
"to be fair, no it has not, he's making 26.5 M$ this year and will make 35.4 M$ next year. The bigger cap hit will be Donovan Mitchell though with 5.2 M$ this year, and a steep (but well-deserved) 28.1 M$ next year (But Conley is not on the payroll for next year, as of now)"
"Seriously, yea. Pat Bev isn't giving the Clips anything anymore. He'd pick up 2 quick fouls guarding Donovan Mitchell every game."

Idk why you‚Äôre getting downvoted. Donovan threw his arm into PG and they both exaggerated contact. Just so happened that Mitchell got tripped up.
"Slow the video down frame by frame. George is running to guard Mitchell. Mitchell puts his arm out near the top of George. They both then exaggerate contact- George falling first. When George falls at an angle he trips Donovan who was also going for the exaggerated contact. No ones at fault here, just a stupid play."
"Then you shouldn‚Äôt have commented like that if you don‚Äôt want people to talk back? If you want to tell me about Donovan Mitchell achievement as a rookie, while being unhappy that I said was heaps better offensively. Wade led his team to a title in his 3rd year, what did Mitchell do in his 3rd year? If you want to come with ‚Äúoh but Jazz is in the West‚Äù, Wade literally beat the West in the finals though? Wade was one of the most unguardable player without a 3 point shot, which seems to be the nephews pick of Mitchell ‚ÄúWade not heaps better offensively‚Äù, if he had a 3 point shot, where would Wade be? Spo himself came out on an interview saying only reason Wade didn‚Äôt shoot more threes was because Spo didn‚Äôt allowed him to. But eh, tried to talk shit but decided that you don‚Äôt want to pick a fight and want to protect your bias in your team while being passive aggressive and decided to play victim? You do you. üôÇ"
If Ben Simmons had half the jump shot of Donovan Mitchell he would be the best player in the league. He would resemble Lebron james in 2007-2009. He would force the defender to come out and he would draw so many easy fouls.
I don't know.  But I do know that it's past time that people stopped saying that the Jazz don't have a star player.  Donovan Mitchell is definitely a star.
"[ESPN] Donovan Mitchell claims to be 'God', calls Paul George ""the Devil"" after Game 2 collision"
Donovan Mitchell is so good at basketball it makes me wanna cry.
"Donovan Mitchell is an elite scorer at the guard position and a decent playmaker. But he is not a superstar. he doesn't do enough on the floor and doesn't have enough impact to be on the same tier as LeBron, Kawhi, Curry, etc."
at the beginning of this season everyone was saying Donovan Mitchell was overrated because he was just putting up tons of points on below average TS%.  and now the narrative is that he actually is a superstar   neither are true
"League is in good hands with Booker &amp; Mitchell being the studs that they are. Donovan is a better version of D wade, then we got a Kobe type player in Booker"
"Donovan Mitchell is the truth,  he goes up a level come playoff time. And legit one of the most fun guys to watch play, you never know when he will decide to just tear down the rim"
"As a neutral, three things stood out  1) Donovan Mitchell is THAT dude; the man has continuously delivered the goods in the playoffs  2) Gobert is worth every goddamn penny of that supermax   3) Bogdanovic really just clamped up Kawhi in the 4th quarter   The Jazz are more than legit, end of discussion (even though it never should have been in question)."
"Reggie overreacted, but Bev wasn't that close either, if he stayed at Joe, Donovan could posibly break into the paint with a fast burst. Tbh, if they didn't want Kawhi on Mitchell and/or Bev on Bogey, that was how the play were setting when teams were ""running"" down the court, they maybe shoulda made that switch earlier and kept closer while tracking back"
"Donovan Mitchell is my favorite player, but Rudy Gobert is hands down better."
Donovan Mitchell is the most underrated star player in the league. People acknowledge that he‚Äôs good. But he‚Äôs always left out of the superstar discussions. He‚Äôs absolutely incredible.
"It‚Äôs also important to note that the nuggets defence was very bad last year. Not to take anything away from Mitchell, he had an unbelievable first round, but Tatum went up against the sixers with thybulle and embiid, the raptors with og and all their defensive talent, and the heat with jimmy and bam. That‚Äôs 3 of the top 5 or 6 wing defenders in the nba. Outside of the heat they were overall weaker teams, but their defence was STOUT. Donovan wouldn‚Äôt not have put up better number against them than the nuggets, but he might have won."
"The phrase ""is Donovan Mitchell a superstar"" is officially retired."
Iirc Kennard was drafted just ahead of Mitchell in the draft. Donovan seems the type to remember everyone drafted ahead of him lol.
Annoint Luka Doncic and Donovan Mitchell. Next series is Booker. Then finals would be KD. Anoooint fuckn everyone
"Poor shooting, no playmaking, just individual attempts. It‚Äôs really ugly basketball, meanwhile Utah out there looking like everyone is a playmaker. I hope they win this series, but with how Donovan Mitchell is looking unfortunately it‚Äôs hard to say right now"
"He was good at getting the refs to give him bullshit calls, and trying to injure Donovan Mitchell at the end of the game.     Otherwise, he's still a bitch."
"Yeah I don't get how anybody can rationally think this is dirty.  Like I get a Jazz fan being upset since Donovan was hurt, but they just ran into each other.  People make it sound like PG tackled Mitchell lol, but he was literally just running over to guard him"
I feel like the clippers shouldn‚Äôt have subbed in Kennard. I have nothing against him personally but he is too much of a liability on defence and Donovan Mitchell always seeks out the matchup.
Lebron  Kawhi  KD  Harden  Steph  Giannis  AD  Jokic  Embiid  Dame  Luka  PG13  CP3  Kyrie  Tatum  Westbrook  Jimmy Butler  Donovan Mitchell  Rudy Gobert   So around the 18-19 range
Donovan Mitchell reminds me a lot of a young Baron Davis. He‚Äôs fun to watch and hope he‚Äôll be alright for the rest of the playoffs.
Ice cold killer Donovan Mitchell
"Donovan Mitchell isn‚Äôt dragging a bunch of bums, Clips not coming back   Suns Jazz series should be cool I guess"
"* Jackson couldn't bail out these scrubs. Maybe the Clips can get him some help by trading PG in the off season  * Speaking of which, Classic Playoff Poo  * Kawhi's OS started malfunctioning near end of the game looking like he was about to reboot and run Terminator.exe  * Ty Lue clapping when Utah made a 3 lollll   * Donovan Mitchell is a stud   * Ingles way underrated      #GG JAZZ FRIENDS"
I just got out of a Thai prison. Is Donovan Mitchell the greatest player in the world?
Donovan Mitchell giving me 2006 Dwyane Wade vibes

We‚Äôre watching Donovan Mitchell realize superstardom right now. It‚Äôs awesome to watch
Now he's trying to injure Donovan Mitchell!?
Imagine if Donovan Mitchell was proportionally the same but 8‚Äô5‚Äù and gravity only affected him half as much as everyone else and everyone had to play 4v5 against his team. Insane.
Donovan 'Fuck ya Chair' Mitchell
Donovan Mitchell having a Luka angry gamer moment
"he‚Äôs a Clippers hater man, Kawhi makes a huge play and he downplays it but when Donovan Mitchell makes one he goes crazy. get hyped equally"
Hey Donovan Mitchell is good
Donovan Mitchell is a superstar.
I mean Donovan Mitchell just rested for a majority of the second half and scored most of his points in the second half last game...
"FR, these people obviously never did association fantasy drafts in 2k. Everyone praises his defensive efficiency and advanced metrics, but I honestly think playing alongside Donovan Mitchell in Utah is the ideal situation for his career."
Charlotte drafted Malik Monk two picks before Donovan Mitchell.
"Donovan 6'10"" wingspan Mitchell is not actually that small"
"Not in order but 15 players I‚Äôd happily take above Rudy Gobert off the top of my head: LeBron, KD, Kawhi, Curry, Harden, Luka, AD, Jokic, Tatum, Booker, Embiid, Giannis, Lillard, Kyrie, Donovan Mitchell"
"-You‚Äôre saying Donovan Mitchell is no better than Jeff Teague, Paul Millsap, Kyle Korver, or Al Horford? Really?  -That subpar wing defense held Giannis to 2 points and 3 FGA in the first half, and most of his points came in the 4th quarter in garbage time.  But maybe you think Giannis is a subpar wing."

"""Russell Westbrook is better than Donovan Mitchell this year"" said by Shaq this week"
"My list, with short explanations:  1) Donnic - it's not close, he's the next great star in the NBA.  If I could pick any player in the league to start a team with, it would be Luka right now.    2) Ben Simmons - there are going to be MVP considerations in his future.  Even if he never learns to shoot, Simmons will be, at worst, a Millionaire's Russell Westbrook in terms of size, athleticism and talent.   3) Jason Tatum - one of the absolute best young players in the game, I thought, long and hard, about including Jaylen Brown in this list, and if it were top 10, Brown would have easily made it.    4) Donovan Mitchell - he is a star, in every sense of the word, and will be a star for the next decade to come.    5) Devin Booker - this last slot came down to him or De'aron Fox.  It was close between them.    Next five for me, in no particular order:  6) Fox 7) Jaylen Brown 8) Jamal Murray 9) Domantas Sabonis 10) John Collins"
THATS MY BOYS! You‚Äôll never hear about it on ESPN or see the games televised. It feels like everyone hates us for no reason. Donovan Mitchell is everything you would want in a superstar. Shaq doesn‚Äôt think so.
"Donovan ""when his shot isn't falling he can't affect the game"" Mitchell with 26/6/8 and the game high plus minus of 18.   tHaNks sHaQ."
The jazz are already doing this with donovan mitchell
Donovan Mitchell is at 83 while shooting 41.9% from three this year too
Donovan Mitchell??
"shit man donovan mitchell averaging 36 points last playoff season, rudy gobert carrying the defense without a decent backup center, and us not having our second best scorer, but you right you cant trust them in the playoffs"
"Donovan ""McNabb"" Mitchell"
The Jazz are easily my second favorite team.   The whole cast is so good and plays such good team basically.   It's insane how the franchise with the (arguable) best point-center duo of all time and a prime Gobert/Donovan Mitchell will still be ringless because of two of the greatest players to ever play getting in the way.
"Rookie Donovan Mitchell led the Jazz to a 4-2 victory over OKC when they had Russ, PG13, and Melo."
They really need a solid 3rd option.  Someone like...Donovan Mitchell
Donovan Mitchell over Clint Capela 2.0.
"Really interesting how certain picks have huge bumps in value when compared to neighboring picks. 7th, 9th, 10th, 13th, 18th, 21st, 23rd, 24th. 7th was no surprise to me given Steph (even though the chart's from 2014), but also has guys like Luol Deng, Eric Gordon, Rip Hamilton, Chris Mullin. 9th is loaded with Dirk, Amar'e, Shawn Marion, DeMar, Iggy, Kemba. 10th has Paul Pierce, Paul George, Joe Johnson, CJ McCollum, Brook Lopez. 13th already looks good recently given Herro and Booker, but also has Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine and of course Kobe. Good spot to draft a SG I guess.  18th, 21st, 23rd, and 24th seem a bit random. 18th has above-average role players/1-time All-Stars with BJ Armstrong, David West, JR Smith, Eric Bledsoe. 21st has Michael Finley and Rajon Rondo, and I like Brandon Clarke and Tyrese Maxey from recent classes. 23rd is represented mostly by Tayshaun Prince. 24th has Kyle Lowry, Andrei Kirilenko, Serge Ibaka, and Derek Fisher.  I wonder if there's actually added value to holding these specific picks in that they are often the beneficiary of teams above them passing on certain types of talent. The ones towards the end of the 1st could also benefit from being typically selected by the league's better teams, meaning those picks go into higher-functioning organizations that are able to properly support their draft picks, and also likely have specific holes for their 1st round pick to fill in a mostly constructed roster.  It's also possibly that there's simply not enough compiled league data to truly draw conclusions about any of these outliers. They could possibly all fall back to the mean given like 50 more years of the NBA."
I can start Zach Lavine or Donovan Mitchell in fantasy today who should I start?
It seems that way but he has been over 20 points a game for the past 5-6 years with good assist and rebounding from an off guard and isn‚Äôt a black hole in defense.   He‚Äôs just overshadowed by Lillard. He has done more in his career then say Donovan Mitchell as the second option. If he was ‚Äúthe man‚Äù on a team he‚Äôs probpvaly be putting up Beal/LaVine like numbers. He reminds me a lot of Mitch Richmond being overlooked because Hardaway and Mullin and then really standing out when he became the guy on a team.
I like Donovan Mitchell his run in the playoffs was one of the best I‚Äôve ever seen and is so underrated
"That  was one playoff run though. The sample size is too small for you to call him '' better than Kyrie''.  Also most of it was one series. The one to take over games against the Clippers was Jokic.   Edit: Would you say ,for example, that playoff Donovan Mitchell is better than Dame?"
Donovan Mitchell is only 6‚Äô1‚Äù but was originally listed at 6‚Äô3‚Äù which was already small at SG. Has a crazy long wingspan though
Lol stop it. Donovan Mitchell was the best player in that series and was going toe to toe with MVP Westbrook
"Ironically, Shaq seems to be his biggest advocate. While Chuck keeps bringing up Donovan Mitchell to get a reaction out of him.  But yeah, the Inside guys love him to death."
Cant believe he thinks donovan mitchell is two players lol.

"Knicks have suckkkked at drafting since Porzingis.   Obi Toppin over Tyrese Haliburton  Kevin Knox over Shae Gilgious Alexander, Michael Porter Jr and Mikal Bridges  Frank Ntilikina over Donovan Mitchell and Bam Adebayo"
Not a troll. There is zero chance I‚Äôm talking Donovan Mitchell and Rudy fucking Gobert over Steph Curry and Draymond Green in the playoffs.  Have fun underperforming in the playoffs.
"Mitchell's skill is much more obvious and noticeable, while Gobert's greatness doesn't usually show up in highlights or stats sheets. But there are a lot of players similar to Donovan Mitchell, but very few like Rudy Gobert."
A couple weeks ago the jump posted a video asking if Donovan Mitchell was the nba version of Patrick mahomes...those motherfuckers are truly awful at their job. Carry on....
This is like the Donovan Mitchell play who is another guy who makes more highlight reel passes than you would expect given where he is as a playmaker(not that Tatum hasn‚Äôt improved as a playmaker)
Same thing happened with Donovan Mitchell his first couple years. And frankly a little to this day still
"Hypothetically, if Donovan Mitchell goes on a 15 game stretch averaging 36 on good efficiency (winning 12 games) is he a top runner for MVP?"
"You‚Äôre right about Westbrook. I guess the point I was heading towards though is that the media crafts their narrative how they want. The criteria of top two seed + good stats stats consistent, but within those 4 teams it changes. There is a reason Donovan Mitchell, Giannis,  and Kawhi aren‚Äôt getting much MVP consideration at all and it‚Äôs not because of on the court play. Other variables factor into it and they change every year."
"&gt; easily all-NBA third team  I'm not saying he won't make it, but between the likes of Steph Curry, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Luka Doncic, Damian Lilliard, Chris Paul, Bradley Beal, Donovan Mitchell, Ben Simmons, Trae Young, and Devin Booker there's *a lot* of competition (and no doubt there will still be names that others will be throwing out there). Definitely wouldn't call him *easily* 3rd team."
Donovan Mitchell isn‚Äôt a superstar lol. He could still make a leap but I don‚Äôt see it honestly.
"Nowadays folks are getting off of his bandwagon, especially after Donovan Mitchell comments and his numerous bruised ego outbursts. However just a year ago you'd be downvoted into oblivion if you said anything against Shaq."
Yeah but the Jazz are better and if we're going only by the seeding logic Donovan Mitchell or Rudy Gobert should be MVP
"I am obviously referring to that in a less crude way. But yes it sounds like nutting over the greatness of lebron is what you are probably doing right now. Sorry to offend you. Sit on your hand and imagine he is jerking you off, might add to your experience.  But yes maybe but those two pieces are not what make the jazz great. They are great additions but no KD or Lebron.  Donovan mitchell was a gamble no one else wanted him but the Jazz saw something.  Edit: grammer"
"The turnovers are bad but I think his shot selection is actually pretty solid, especially considering the role he‚Äôs often had to play in the bulls short handed offense this season.  I think everyone just sees that a lot of his faults could/would be papered over on a team where he didn‚Äôt have to do so much playmaking AND scoring.  Athletic two-guards with pinpoint accuracy are exactly the types of players who can tear up playoff defenses in the modern NBA. They‚Äôre offensive usefulness seems to even be surpassing the typical 6-8 power wing. Just look at who thrived in the bubble games: Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, even Tyler Herro.  I salivate thinking about what Lavine would look like taking some pressure off guys like Giannis, Embiid, Jokic and Lebron."
[Donovan Mitchell](https://sneakernews.com/2020/08/04/crayola-adidas-don-issue-2-crayon-pack-release-info/)
"He‚Äôs properly rated, too inconsistent as of now, he has the potential to be good. Here‚Äôs the list right now of at least top 25, in no order, LeBron, Kawhi, KD, Giannis, Jokic, Embiid, Harden, AD, PG, Curry, Kyrie, Butler, Tatum, Jayden Brown, Donovan Mitchell, Luka, Trae Young, Bradley Beal, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Ingram, and I‚Äôm probably missing a few. These are the people who could carry their team, or at least have an impact of changing the team to at least a contender. Does Siakam fit in that list?"
I set your Krispy Kreme on fire so you won‚Äôt be so fat. Your welcome. - Arsonist Donovan Mitchell.
dont bother with him man. im in utah right now and their radio hosts think donovan mitchell is the mvp of the league lol
Caving in to racists who don‚Äôt want to learn about black history month is dumb as hell. Donovan Mitchell himself spoke about this.
"Says the conservative lol. You‚Äôre the same person who called Mark Cuban a communist for his national anthem stance.   I thought you ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt care about politics‚Äù, yet now you‚Äôre making it all about politics. Get over yourself, Donovan Mitchell himself is a liberal."
What is wrong with this sub. You honestly think Rudy Gobert is their all star over Donovan Mitchell ? You people are nuts.
&gt; Tough to be the 3rd best player on your own team and make the asg  Donovan Mitchell about to do it anyway
Show me on this doll where Donovan Mitchell touched you
How about Donovan Mitchell
Why did you highlight ‚ÄúSINGLE‚Äù like it somehow diminishes the effect of it? A whole school devising a plan to allow their students to opt out of learning about Black History is significant. Definitely way bigger of an issue than Shaq criticizing Donovan Mitchell.
"Give it up Shaq, just admit that you made a mistake in your judgement of Donovan Mitchell. They have one of the best records in the NBA, compare that to the Wizards."
"Yes my man Donovan Mitchell the guy who dropped 36 on the Celtics yesterday, while averaging 24+ points a game and being the only reason the jazz is relevant isn‚Äôt the best player on Utah. Sure. Good discussion it was fun lmao."
"You thinking Donovan Mitchell is the Jazz best player shows just how far out of touch you are, I thought this was going to be a fun conversation but yeeeesh that's borderline delusion.     It's common knowledge the most dominant basketball player this year is Embiid, not Lebron. If MVP voting was done today Lebron would be third at best behind Embiid and Jokic. If Jokic cools down in the second half and stops playing like the best all-around player in the league and the Lakers actually take the 1st seed from the Jazz then Lebron has a case, but as of now there's a 0% chance he wins it ahead of the other 2 guys."
"It‚Äôs common basketball knowledge the best player right now(lebron)on the best team(Lakers, I have them finishing as the one seed not the jazz this year) is the MVP. Same reason Giannis won it last year, he had the stats and the record to back it up. Conley doesn‚Äôt. Lebrons stats actually contribute to winning basketball not losses like Jokic and Curry so he‚Äôs ahead of them and mike Conley isn‚Äôt the best player on the jazz it‚Äôs Donovan Mitchell so he doesn‚Äôt qualify. There‚Äôs your MVP qualification"
"D is the closest fit for me because I live in Kentucky and cheer for a lot of former UK players (and Ja Morant too). But I also really like some non-UK guys too (Donovan Mitchell, Jokic, Lillard, Curry, Zion) so when it's all said and done I can find some way to root for nearly all the teams. Come playoff time I usually root for underdogs with UK players, so the Heat making the finals last year was dreamy"
" Donovan Mitchell would have to sustain high scoring over multiple seasons and have success in the playoffs more than once for most people to consider him a superstar imo, and while I think he certainly has potential, I attribute the Jazz's success this season to great team building and the stepping up of role players more than the absolute domination of Mitchell. As for Gobert, I don't think anyone would ever consider him a superstar considering his huge flaws on offense that can take him out of games when teams gameplan against him."
"Honestly, Westbrook from even last year, I would tentatively agree. This season, he's just not been that good. Plus, Donovan Mitchell is clearly the best player on the team with the best record in the NBA. I honestly do not understand why Shaq is pursuing this beef for no reason."
Donovan Mitchell
Someone needs to make a Moana parody video with Shaq and Donovan Mitchell
1. James Harden 2. Bradley Beal 3. Devin Booker 4. Donovan Mitchell 5. Jrue Holiday 6. CJ McCollum 7. Victor Oladipo 8. Seth Curry 9. Danny Green
Donovan Mitchell
Yeah I‚Äôm definitely having a huge get off my lawn moment in this thread right now   They‚Äôre a really good team but get back to me in June. Feel like I‚Äôm about to stumble on some Gobert is basically just Duncan takes and Conley is Parker with defense. Oh and I‚Äôm sure Donovan Mitchell is a better player than Manu and joe ingles is Boris diaw on a diet.
Donovan Mitchell wildin‚Äô out
"Donovan Mitchell has played great in the last two games without Conley. This is the first time I've really bought into the ""Mitchell's best position is PG"" idea. In previous years when he's had to play PG because of injuries, he's scored a lot because he has the ball so often, but it didn't really make the team better. This year and the past two games especially, his passing and command of the offense from the PG position is on another level. He's always had the ability to make crazy highlight assists, but it's gone from one every 2 or 3 games to 2 or 3 in every game. And imo the biggest improvement in his passing is he's gotten so much better at getting the ball to Gobert for dunks - that was on display more in the Indiana game, but he still had a couple nice ones at the end of the game.  Two great plays down the stretch from Mitchell: around 6 minutes left in the 4th, Boston on a 11-4 run to cut an 11 point lead to 4. Out of a timeout, Mitchell gets the inbound in the backcourt and sees Boston hasn't really gotten their defense set so he throws a laser to Bogdanovic open in the corner who hits the 3.  Second play, around 3 minutes left in the game. Jazz lead down to 4 again. Mitchell comes up with the rebound and sprints up the floor, forcing the only two celtic defenders that are back to go to him so he doesn't have an open lane to the basket. This leaves Ingles wide open behind Mitchell, so he gets him the ball and Ingles drains the 3 to go back up 7."
You're not watching the games if you think he's playing up to par. It's like calling 2017 Donovan Mitchell an Allstar without looking at his efficiency.
"Lmaooo mans got downvoted for saying Donovan Mitchell is NOT a superstar, the hivemind has taken over in this thread."
"The Jazz pick and roll game is strong. If you sell out on defending the three, the Jazz will knock it to Rudy inside, or drive with the threat of the lob to Rudy.  Atlanta tried what you are suggesting, and had the personnel to get it done with Capela in the paint. They didn't have Trae, which actually helped them defensively. The Jazz started slow while they adjusted to the strategy, with 20 then 25 points in the first two quarters then they made the halftime adjustments and scored 67 in the final half. They just changed their rubs and screens by moving Rudy higher on the pick and ended up with 20 made 3 pointers.  Earlier in the season we lost to Phoenix and the Wolves (with KAT) because they got straight up physical with our shooters, moving as far as the refs would allow them. Jazz have adjusted to that as well by speeding up the pace and allowing less grind in the half court. Jazz primarily shoot in the first half of the shot clock and take the first open shot which leaves less room for thuggery.   Ironically, I think that the best team that could pull of the type of defense you are suggesting is the Jazz themselves. They do an excellent job of defending the three point line because of Rudy Gobert who can defend the paint area while contesting the perimeter also if needed. Jazz are 5th in the league at opponents 3 point percentage. Atlanta is second (which explains their strategy against the Jazz.)  And finally, we may be getting to the point where continually suggesting that Donovan Mitchell isn't a superstar is splitting hairs. He did exactly what superstars do last night and does it over and over again."
I think Jojo will miss too many games.    Its gonna go to Lebron. The narrative of being ~~the oldest~~ 2nd oldest to win MVP along with his numbers and the fact that lakers will be top 3 at worse in the west will do it.    Hot take Donovan Mitchell will finish in the top 3 voting.
"Usually yes, but Gobert is kind of an excuse to that rule. In 2018 the Jazz were 37-19 when he played and 11-14 when he didn‚Äôt. A top-5 team with him and a bottom-10 team without him. He doesn‚Äôt miss many games so it‚Äôs not as obvious to people. Hell last year the average NBA fan would argue that Donovan Mitchell is their best player and it‚Äôs not even up for debate.  One of, if not the most underrated players in the league. Everyone is so caught up with big men shooting 3‚Äôs and scoring 25+ points a game that we don‚Äôt even take a traditional big seriously anymore. I agree that top-5 for MVP is maybe a little aggressive, but he‚Äôs in the top-10 somewhere."
pump Donovan Mitchell just to fuck with shaq.
"Right now, I think the ratio is about 1 all star to every 5 players in the dataset, so that would be an improvement.  If I filter further, I will definitely post more results.  &amp;#x200B;  I also thought about that, and if you check out my team vs the top 20 scorers, it's not really close. Notable top PPG guys who aren't in my all star list: Zach LaVine, Jaylen Brown, Paul George, Donovan Mitchell, Jerami Grant, CJ McCollum, Kyrie Irving. It selected a lot of people who are really valuable under advanced statistics but don't put up huge numbers instead."
Here are all the guys people will want to mention ranked in my opinion. Lot of these guys are really close to one another. Especially in the range of Holiday to Murray.  1. Stephen Curry 2. James Harden 3. Damian Lillard 4. Kyrie Irving 5. Bradley Beal 6. Chris Paul 7. Trae Young 8. Demar Derozan 9. Kyle Lowry 10. Donovan Mitchell 11. Devin Booker 12. CJ McCollum 13. Jrue Holiday 14. De'Aaron Fox 15. Ja Morant 16. Zach Lavine 17. Mike Conley 18. Jamal Murray 19. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 20. Fred Van Vleet 21. Malcolm Brogdon 22. Kemba Walker 23. Russell Westbrook 24. Collin Sexton 25. Marcus Smart

Such a lazy take. The 2015 Hawks didn't have anyone like Donovan Mitchell to be that superstar scorer that steps up whenever his team needs it.
"He'll come out later in the season and say he said that to Donovan Mitchell to motivate him to become better and say, ""See, Ernie, it worked.""  He can never be wrong."
"Been rooting for this all year, they are such a great team this year and donovan mitchell just seems like such a great dude. conley too"
donovan mitchell proving hes better than tatum AND brown. no contest
"Donovan Mitchell had a slow start this season, but he's playing at an all-star level now."
&gt; holy christ  You misspelled Donovan Mitchell
"Without Conley, the lead is too close for comfort entering clutch time, but as long as Jazz have Donovan, everything's fine.  The Jazz having two good ball handlers aside from Conley and Mitchell (Ingles and Clarkson having &lt;2 turnovers per game this season) is reassuring as a team.  They played very good this game imho."
SPICY TAKE:  Donovan mitchell is good at basketball
Lebron may not be Thanos but I‚Äôm starting to think Donovan Mitchell **is**.
I would absolutely love Donovan Mitchell leading the Jazz to a chip just to prove Shaq wrong and see his reaction on live TV
DONOVAN MITCHELL  TALK TO HIM NICE SHAQ
"Donovan Mitchell fucking buried those two late 3s, jesus."
Shaq about to act like he birthed Donovan Mitchell and trained him to do this
donovan mitchell mvp
Donovan Fucking Mitchell ladies and gentlemen.
DONOVAN MITCHELL IS A COLD BLOODED ASSASSIN
Great assist by Donovan Mitchell.
Donovan Mitchell block party!
I wonder when we're somehow going to get that Celtic Pride sequel with Daniel Stern and Dan Aykroyd kidnapping Donovan Mitchell.
Donovan Mitchell.
"Donovan Mitchell really takes the dumbest, most unnecessary shots. This could get ugly real quick."
"Yea its just odd. Look at how Dennis treated players like Joe Johnson, Dante Exum, and Derrick Favors where he chose to trust/reward them or trade them in ways that didn't really benefit the Jazz because he respected them as people. He's always had a reputation of being respectful and high character. He's also actively provided a platform through the Jazz organization for players to engage in activism for what they were passionate about. He's trusted by high character people like Quin Snyder and Donovan Mitchell. This is why its so confusing.    Obviously, if its true, no fucking way should he stay in charge. Our players don't deserve that shit."
Donovan Mitchell hears about it and DL is gone. Our new owner is zero tolerance about this
"Idk I think they have comparable star power to Denver. Rudy, Mitchell, Conley, Bojan, and the frontrunner for 6MOY vs Jokic, Murray, MPJ, Millsap, etc. Obviously Jokic is well above any of those other guys, but Rudy and Donovan are better than any Nugget sans Jokic."
Donovan Mitchell walking in looking like Wesley Snipes
"From what I understand, Zion wasn't the wildcard, he'd need to be replaced by a front court player.  If you want to get Booker in, you need to replace a guard, or one of the wildcards. I believe the wild cards were Donovan Mitchell and Paul George."
Are you betting that Donovan Mitchell and Conley/Clarkson will outperform Bron/AD or Kawhi/George when the role players have been shut out of the offense in those types of situations?
In another timeline Dante Exum and Donovan Mitchell are wrecking backcourts all over the NBA
"Three Point contest is not for someone like Donovan Mitchell.. He'd struggle horribly  &gt;  Even Harden looked like shit in the 3pt contest.. These are extremely ""rhythm"" based shooters. They are mainly scorers, not pure sharpshooters  &gt;   Joe Ingles would have been a better option.. Don should have been in the Dunk Contest instead"
"When Mitchell was in the ROY race with Simmons, I heard again and again from media people that everyone was blown away by his maturity and work ethic.  The people who matter in NBA circles really, really like Donovan Mitchell.  I think that makes a big difference for stuff like this.  Mitchell has been ID'd as a future face of the league, and they're going to keep promoting him whenever they can.  He's a leader on social issues, he's involved in the NBAPA, he's got a signature shoe deal and he'll presumably be a mainstay on TV and NBA marketing for a long time.  I don't know if Booker has a *bad* reputation, but he's no Donovan Mitchell.  He's probably better known for dating a Kardashian and streaming Fortnite with KAT and Dlo than getting involved in the behind the scenes stuff."
"C: Nikola Jokic / Joel Embiid  PF: LeBron James / Giannis   SF: Kawhi Leonard / Kevin Durant  SG: Luka Donƒçiƒá  / Bradley Beal  PG: Steph Curry / Trae Young  6: Damian Lillard / Nikola Vucevic  7: DeMar DeRozan / Jaylen Brown  8: Christian Wood / Kyle Lowry  9: SGA / Zach LaVine  10: Chris Paul / Sexton  11: Donovan Mitchell / Jerami Grant   12: De'Aaron Fox / Sabonis  13: Zion Williamson / Randle  14: Ja Morant / Jimmy Butler  15: KAT / Hayward  &amp;#x200B;  All things considered it's not a horrible idea, each team has an All Star caliber player on it's roster, but the problem is injuries and all star players underperforming . Like in Miami's case, Butler is their clear cut all star but he's missed games, does Tyler Herro become their representative? Same thing with Minnesota who KAT is their best player, but Anthony Edwards has played more. Then you start having All Star nods becoming meaningless as guys like Herro would have All Star nods over James Harden."
"Thats Steph Curry numbers, Donovan Mitchell isnt Steph Curry and never will be lmao. Shouldve expected the numbers to stabilize in the first place."
"Just saying, if you believe this is true and how all-star should selected may I direct you to Bookers snub last year.  Russ 26/8/7 but his 52.6 TS% was absolute garbage.  Booker 27/4/6 on 63.4% TS  Donovan Mitchell 25/4/4 on 56.6% TS  But ya know... record   And that is literally the entire point. What went against Booker last year, pushed Zion in and what went against Booker this year, got Mitchell and Russ in."
This years stats:  Booker is averaging 25/4/4 on 61% TS  Zion is averaging 25/7/3 on 66% TS  ... but Booker is on the 20-10 Suns which own the 4th best record in the NBA while the Pelicans sit at 22nd best record.   Here are stat comparisons from last year:  Russ 26/8/7 but his 52.6 TS% was absolute garbage.  Booker 27/4/6 on 63.4% TS  Donovan Mitchell 25/4/4 on 56.6% TS  But ya know... record  Tell me which part is disingenuous.
Donovan Mitchell sitting in the corner.
"&gt; I‚Äôm a Jazz fan, and I‚Äôd argue that he has been better than Donovan Mitchell this year at making the team better  I'm a jazz fan, and I'd argue that you sir are a complete idiot."
Zion wasn't the wildcard ffs. How hard is it to comprehend. Wildcards were Donovan Mitchell and Paul George. Whom are you replacing between these 2.
I'm not sure how you can say it's a made up narrative when Donovan Mitchell made it over Booker last year.   '20 Mitchell - 24.3/4.3/4.3 on 56.4% TS (winning percentage .690)  '20 Booker - 26.4/4.2/6.3 on 62.5% TS (winning percentage .428)   '21 Booker - 24.7/3.8/4.3 on 60.7 TS% (winning percentage .667)  '21 Zion - 25.1/6.8/3.1 on 65.6 TS% (winning percentage .433)
"I‚Äôm a Jazz fan, and I‚Äôd argue that he has been better than Donovan Mitchell this year at making the team better. Higher efficiency, and better advanced metrics than Mitchell. At the same time, I understand why the eye test is important to the nba, and they‚Äôd rather have young, flashy, explosive offensive players as the face of the league. But in terms of value to his team, mike Conley is way up near the top of the league this year (and years past). He‚Äôd have probably gotten in by now if he talked a little more trash, and drew more attention to himself."
     Giannis (26)  Luka (21) wtf this dudes only 21...  \---  Embiid (26)  Jokic (26)  AD (27)  \---       Players that could age well and keep pace:  Trae Young (22)  Bam Adebayo (23)  Bradley Beal (27)  \---  Zach Lavine (25)  Donovan Mitchell (24)  Sabonis (24)  Jayson Tatum (22)  Jaylen Brown (24)
"Fam... I just named 4 guys who rose to the occasion just like him. Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell, etc all rose to the occasion just like he did. And just like butler they all lost. What are you smoking? It must be strong as fuck"
"Which of the guards would you take out. There must be three frontcourt player (AD Zion and Gobert) 2 guards and 2 wild cards. So you have to get rid of PG, dame, donovan mitchell or cp3. Dame and mitchell are so easy. They have to be there. And as a suns guy i guess you probably arent insisting him over cp3. I guess that leaves Paul George. And i dont know the comparison super well. Im just leaving this here so you know what you are arguing. Its not book vs ad or zion."
"Then going by your cherry picked stat, Nikola Vucevic (-11.8), Zach Lavine  (-6.7), Chris Paul (-.5), and Donovan Mitchell (-7.8), are all garbage and should not be included either since they make their teams worse. And this means that Michael Carter-Williams is the MVP of the league this year with an incredible +22.3. He improves his team more than anyone!  Sabonis is one of 3 players averaging 20/10/5  on 50% FG%. The others are Jokic and Giannis. He is the only player to ever average 20/10/5 and not make the All Star game. He is carrying the Pacers while they are down TJ Warren and Caris Levert. Saying he isn't very good is just not correct. And remains the dumbest fucking thing I've ever read."
Donovan Mitchell scored like 12 points in 1 minute and 29 seconds the other night so quite a lot is possible
"Where's my man, Mike Conley?!? More of an impact player than CP3 or Donovan Mitchell."
"Dude it‚Äôs just hard to be a guard in the west. He made it last year. It‚Äôs unfortunate but all his counting stats are down from last year. He‚Äôs averaging 24/4/3. Who do you replace to put him in?  Dame? LOL.  Donovan Mitchell? Same exact stats and MUCH better defense on the best team in the NBA. Sorry. PG13? Better numbers, better efficiency, MUCH better defense, better team. Sorry. Chris Paul? Maybe. Could‚Äôve been a toss up between the two of them. Paul got the nod, I‚Äôd have given it to Book, but I don‚Äôt argue with the decision.  The kicker is that AD will miss the game and they‚Äôll have to name a replacement. I assume it‚Äôll go to Mike Conley (because of the narrative and that fact that by almost every conceivable advanced metric he‚Äôs been the best player in the NBA this year), but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Booker gets it.  Tl;dr: there‚Äôs a lot of incredible players in the west and an absolute max of 7 backcourt all-star spots. Booker is arguably the 7the or 8th best backcourt player in the conference. ‚ÄúThe excuses have run out‚Äù seems pretty dramatic."
"Wrong. Per Yahoo,   Western Conference G: Damian Lillard  G: Chris Paul  FC: Anthony Davis  FC: Rudy Gobert  FC: Zion Williamson  WC: Donovan Mitchell  WC: Paul George"
"[Charania] Sources: The East are tantalised by James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic. And the West are enamoured with Chris Paul, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis"
"Do wins matter or not? All I‚Äôve heard for years is that they are a criteria. If they don‚Äôt, then Donovan Mitchell shouldn‚Äôt be an all-star.  Booker: 25/4/4 61% TS 20-10  Mitchell: 25/4/5 56% TS 25-6  Zion: 25/7/3 66% TS 13-17"
"West: Chris Paul, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis   East: James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic  Just a feeling I have"
"Good points there. I don't think the team being middle of the pack is really relevant, as we have fairly weak defenders outside of Turner right now. The Jazz have Mike Conley (above average), Donovan Mitchell (above average), Bojan Bogdanovic (average), Royce O'Neal (elite), and Ingles (borderline elite) off the bench."
"[Your reaction when the Celtics trade for Mitchell Robinson, not Donovan Mitchell](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7abKf2GhzwLAVaQE/giphy.gif)"
"Probably could add CJ Mccollum, Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker. Julius Randle is having a hell of a year."
Devin Booker 25/4/4 on 50/38/85 61% TS  Donovan Mitchell 25/4/5 on 43/39/83 56% TS  Chris Paul 17/5/9 on 49/40/97 59% TS  Mike Conley 16/3/6 on 44/41/82 59% TS  Demar DeRozan 20/5/7 on 49/33/89 60% TS  Three of these players should be all-stars. Tell me there is no world in which Booker deserves it.
"Paul George is up there, but I really like watching Donovan Mitchell. His bounce, footwork, speed, all done so smoothly.  On the flip side, I love him so much but Jerami Grant's game isn't aesthetically pleasing. Effective, but not pretty."
Donovan Mitchell üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"I trust Gobert to handle that honestly, his defense has never been a problem in the playoffs even against Golden State and Houston, his offense has been, and Portland can't switch to take away what he does best.  \+ Snyder is a good coach and every good coach (every coach that is not Billy Donovan) that has played Portland in the playoffs has found a way to reduce Dame's effectivness a bit (even tho his passing and splitting of PNR is way better now).  I think Dallas could be a worse match up for Utah, they at least have more bodies to thrown at Mitchell and Clarkson and would force Gobert a shooter most of the time"
"If you had to look at a front runner for MVP, you gotta include Donovan Mitchell. Just like curry in 2014-15 he‚Äôs leading the team with great chemistry to the best record in the NBA."
Donovan Mitchell be as good as PG or Kawhi. Somehow Gobert can punish with low post moves and be playmaker in high post like Brad Miller?
"ü•± bruh I'm calmer than still water.   Philly's 1-5 without Embiid. 19-6 with him.  Lakers' 22-10 with/without Bron because he's played every game.  Philly's record is 20-11.  If anything, I just applied the same logic with Donovan Mitchell. The Jazz are: 22-6 with him 2-0 without him  Jazz evidently don't struggle without Donovan.   Philly evidently struggle without Embiid.  Take that for data."
Since we won in 03 lol we haven‚Äôt been relevant besides us not taking Donovan Mitchell (I‚Äôm so jealous it hurts) and trading Drummond for a second round pick.
Embiid and dark horse Donovan Mitchell if Jazz ends up with best record.
G- Luka Doncic   G- Stephen Curry   F- LeBron James   F- Anthony Davis[INJ]  F- Nikola Jokic   Bench:  G- Damian Lillard   G- Donovan Mitchell   F- Kawhi Leonard   F- Paul George   F- Rudy Gobert  WC- Devin Booker   WC- Chris Paul  INJ-REP- Zion Williamson  The only player whom I think would miss out would be DeMar DeRozan
"Man, the Jazz are legit. I‚Äôm scared in facing off against them in the playoffs. Donovan Mitchell one of the nicest guys in the league too."
But the real question is which one is better than Donovan Mitchell?
"In no particular order, Donovan Mitchell, Paul George, Zion Williamson, Rudy Gobert, Damian Lillard, Mike Conley, And more. Not to say they don‚Äôt deserve an all star, but the west is to stacked for me to rank them above these guys."
"We're averaging the most 3 pointers per game by any team in NBA history and our rotation players, minus the big men, just shoot an insanely efficient clip on high volume. I'll repost this table from another comment, that's accurate as of the completion of tonights game.     |Player|G|3P|3PA|3P%| :--|--:|--:|--:|--:| |Joe Ingles|27|68|147|**46.26%**| |Royce O'Neale|31|53|126|**42.06%**| |Mike Conley|25|70|170|**41.18%**| |Bojan Bogdanoviƒá|31|78|200|**39.00%**| |Donovan Mitchell|29|98|252|**38.89%**| |Jordan Clarkson|31|100|263|**38.02%**| |Georges Niang|31|37|101|**36.63%**|"
"We've got shooters everywhere that it's kinda ridiculous that Niang is only the 7th best shooter (by % this year even tho he's at 41.0% and 40.0% the last two seasons) in our rotation, apart from Gobert and Favors.      |Player|G|3P|3PA|3P%| :--|--:|--:|--:|--:| |Joe Ingles|27|68|147|**46.26%**| |Royce O'Neale|31|53|126|**42.06%**| |Mike Conley|25|70|170|**41.18%**| |Bojan Bogdanoviƒá|31|78|200|**39.00%**| |Donovan Mitchell|29|98|252|**38.89%**| |Jordan Clarkson|31|100|263|**38.02%**| |Georges Niang|31|37|101|**36.63%**|"
"Not sure if the Jazz are able to withstand nonexistent Donovan Mitchell first halfs in the Playoffs, but we'll see. I get that is the elephant in the room Jazz fans choose to stay quiet about, judging from these threads."
Antagonizing night in and night out? Do yourself a favor and see what donovan mitchell had to say about Pat Bev from when we played them a few nights ago from his post game comments. Tell yourself if he'd make those comments if Pat Bev truly does what you think he does.
Mentioning Devin Booker or Donovan Mitchell
"he‚Äôs actually the best defensive guard this season according to analytics, and opponents have praised his defense like Donovan Mitchell the other night. He passes the eye test too.  I just don‚Äôt think you watch enough Clippers if you suggest Pat Bev isn‚Äôt worth having on the floor"
"i wouldn‚Äôt say his is the best but i really, really, really like watching donovan mitchell take a jumpshot. so pretty."
"There‚Äôs a million different things to explain the poor ratings other than ‚ÄúLebron fatigue‚Äù...  having no fans takes away a big aspect of the viewing experience, the lakers vs heat matchup was just bad, people have been fed up with nba‚Äôs BLM stance, etc etc etc  Having LeBron in the Finals is the best way to pull people that dont usually watch the nba because theyre going to at least know lebron. if someone that doesnt watch the nba turns on the finals and its tudy gobert, donovan mitchell, mike conley making up one of thr teams theyre gonna say who tf are these guys and turn it off."
Literally last game Donovan Mitchell was saying that Pat Bev deserves being all-defense.  I think it's really possible to say he is pretty good at defense but he is so dirty that it ruins it for us fans (and surely opponents) as well.
Donovan Mitchell
"Donovan Mitchell 100%, he reminds me of that Jamal Crawford kind of player that I'm just not a fan of. Jordan Clarkson has been better this year for sure."
"I swear I‚Äôve seen him do that same dunk 100x.   Now that I think about it, Donovan Mitchell and Jayson Tatum also do the same dunk every single time"
Usually top 10 players aren‚Äôt decided by a single postseason run. If we‚Äôre doing numbers for only that particular playoffs then Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell would bounce Tatum out of the top 10.
"This is some really strange Fox News rhetoric trying to create an argument where one does not exist. I didn't compare Donovan Mitchell to Ben Simmons, nor did I speculate on why he's viewed as a star in the collective consciousness.  I grouped them together as examples of star players who are critiqued as being unable to win a championship. That was what this thread is about. If you want to discuss that phenomenon, I'm here for it.   If you want to drum up an argument about what qualifies star players as star players or Ben Simmons vs. Donovan Mitchell, I'm sure you could find some discourse or someone willing to argue with you on NBA Twitter. Godspeed."
Donovan Mitchell
"Isn't that what happens when you have strong regular season performances but can't put it together in the playoffs? Harden gets it, Westbrook gets it, AD and Lowry got it until they won. Shit, look at Donovan Mitchell or Ben Simmons. People grow weary of the regular season hero."
So should Donovan Mitchell be the mvp favorite by ur logic since he‚Äôs the best player on the best team in the nba?
"I kinda like these tiers.  Destroyer Class: Lebron, KD, Kawhi, Steph, Harden  Wrecking Crew: Bradley Beal, Zach LaVine, Donovan Mitchell, Jamal Murray, Devin Booker"
"Not necessarily every time but usually it is, a good example is the jazz and Rudy gobert and Donovan Mitchell. You could argue Rudy is the more important player but Donovan probably has a better chance to win mvp or make the all star game"
"Middleton isn‚Äôt strong. Also shouldn‚Äôt Terry be put in the fringe category? Him and Gordon been killing it down in Charlotte. They‚Äôre the 7th seed rn, a game behind 4th. Also Donovan Mitchell is a lock."
"""That is a damn clown. Donovan mitchell?!"
"People give us shit for Donovan Mitchell, but we just traded our pick to Utah and they told us to draft him for them.  What we *really* deserve shit for is drafting Rudy Gobert and trading him to the Jazz for Erick Green later on draft inght.  Do you know who Erick Green is? Neither do I.  Though hey, if we had Gobert we probably never end up with Jokic, so maybe it worked out"
"&gt; I know this sub is stat obsessed, but the entire point of sports is to win the games   By that logic, Donovan Mitchell should be starting the All Star game over Damian Lillard and this argument is moot."
"It sucks, but that's the internet unfortunately. Donovan Mitchell was bombarded with racist shit on his social media for ""snubbing"" Chinese fans."
Nuggets really traded down from donovan Mitchell for trey lyles and the 24th pick which was OG just for him to get picked 23rd
"He wouldn't it's not that clear cut, he's not even leading the betting odds       LeBron James +180  Joel Embiid +450  Nikola Jokic +500  Luka Doncic +1000  Giannis Antetokounmpo +1200  Steph Curry +1200  Kevin Durant +1400  Damian Lillard +2500  Kawhi Leonard +4000  Donovan Mitchell +6600"
"derrick jones jr, donovan mitchell?? jaren jackson jr??"
Imagine Lebron getting burned by Donovan Mitchell on a 1v1 ?   Doesn‚Äôt look good does it.
"Yep, you guys look great now, I just don't know if you guys can sustain it in the playoffs, maybe if Donovan Mitchell can find that second gear again like against the Nuggets"
Lmao wtf are you talking about.  You are comparing apples to oranges.   Donovan Mitchell actually played in a game and was guarded by Pat Beverley.   Gtfo with your toxic trash.
"Nah r/NBA knows way better about Beverley's defence than Donovan Mitchell.   It's you mouth breathers who just want to use that same phrase ad nauseam.   ""pAT bEV tRIcKed YaLL"""
yes please explain to donovan mitchell why you disagree with him

DONOVAN MITCHELL IS A MONSTER
"Mfs sleeping on the Jazz and i'm not here for it. They went down early when the Clips played ridiculous defense, and then made crucial adjustments at halftime and made it a game. This was straight-up playoff basketball minus foul calls. People that compare this team to the hawks are idiots. Donovan Mitchell has that clutch gene, dude had 27 points in the second half ""WhO's GonNa ScOrE iN ThE 4Th??"". They also have Gobert whose impact doesn't show up 100% in stats. To say that the Jazz won't be able to compete in 7 games is ludicrous as they literally just competed. The clippers played better at the end and sealed it off but the Jazz didn't stop fighting. Respect to Mitchell he's my favorite player in the league, the Jazz are real contenders fuck you mfs saying they can't hang when this is the first game you've watched of them and they literally did hang."
Donovan Mitchell almost went full Tracy McGrady
GGs Jazz. Donovan Mitchell is a killer. Clarkson is a bucket getter. My goodness.
Donovan Mitchell is really clutch
"Donovan Mitchell might just be the best player when it comes to comebacks than end up just short. Dude had no business draining all of the shots that he did in a game that seemed out of reach.   Respect to that hustle, always feels like he tries until the final whistle."
Donovan Mitchell nearly went full Tracy McGrady in that final minute
The Jazz rebounded like total poonans tonight. Zubac got like 4 in the first half and Kawhi got two in a row with less than a minute left that would've sealed the game if not for Donovan Mitchell

"I tend to agree with JVGs rants though. He doesn't like the rules and the touchy fouls that slow the pace of the game down. There are a lot more extended stoppages for reviews with challenges or reviews to see if there is a flagrant/clear path foul. I wish they would have a more efficient replay official in a media box to expedite that.  I have an issue with people like Shaq talking down to players like Donovan Mitchell or Gobert, still not knowing how to pronounce Giannis's name despite him being a back to back MVP, mixing up nationalities or the speaking the incorrect language to other international players."
donovan mitchell doing donovan mitchell things
Donovan Mitchell is a young D Wade with a 3 ball
donovan mitchell
DONOVAN FUCKING MITCHELL
I like Donovan Mitchell but very much dislike Gobert. I‚Äôm feeling very conflicted about whether I should jump on the Jazz wagon or not.
"hero ball from Donovan Mitchell, someone tell him he's not Kobe"
#DONOVAN MITCHELL WOW
Donovan Mitchell is prime Wade?
"Strong disagree.  Donovan Mitchell, Zach Randolph, Ray Allen, Paul Pierce, Jason Williams, KD, Rodman.  I think after a certain amount of time, you ""own"" your number and it looks good on you."
"The Clippers were not and are not a good defensive team so Idk what you're talking about. Donovan Mitchell torched them just as much right after and Booker would have torched them the entire series just like in game 1 if he didn't break his nose and have to wear a mask (ruining his peripheral vision).   Also I like how you at least acknowledge the stat padding lmao. ""yEaH bUt hE DidN't dO iT iN gAmE 5"". Which btw he scored 42 on 37 shots in that game lol so if you wanna call it a good game then sure.. I guess? Russell Westbrook minus all of the athleticism and somehow even worse on defense.   Regarding Dame, I don't feel the need to talk him up because for the most part I think he's properly rated. He's somewhere between 7-11 and I think that's the fair. On the other hand, Luka is by far the most overrated superstar. At best he is number 10, and that's me being generous."
"He was 16th in FTA per game, higher than lebron. Higher than devin booker, higher than Kawhi, higher than Donovan Mitchell. Stop with the bullshit that he doesn‚Äôt get superstar calls."
"Should be fine with like 7  1 - doesn't play, G League caliber player  2 - end of bench role player (like 10th man)  3 - solid bench role player  4 - starter caliber player (not necessarily a starter, and every starter isn't necessarily here)  5 - good to great starter  6 - all star caliber   7 - superstar  Maybe could even get down to 6 if you consolidate 1 and 2. Don't see a need to meaningfully separate, say, Joel Embiid from Donovan Mitchell, they're both all stars. Sure Embiid is the best big in the league but who cares lol"
It‚Äôs amazing how people have just memory-holed how dreadful he was in 2019. If he plays like he did in 2020-21 in 2019 there‚Äôs a very real chance we could‚Äôve won it all that year with how good the defense of the Rubio-Mitchell-Ingles-Crowder-Gobert lineup was. We held Houston to under 100 ppg over the last 3 games of the series and still lost because Donovan couldn‚Äôt hit the broadside of a barn.

"PG: Cade Cunningham $2  SG: Donovan Mitchell $4  SF: Caris LeVert $2  PF: OG Anunoby $2  C: Joel Embiid $5  --------------------  You have to give up value somewhere, so I think taking Cade for $2 is a worthwhile bet.   Embiid is an obvious choice IMO.   Anunoby for $2 seems like an absolute steal.   Then having to decide between either getting another $5 player and a $1, or taking a $4 and a $2, and IMO I'd rather take a guy like Mitchell and the step up in talent from $1 to $2, than have a $5 talent and have to somehow shoehorn someone like Danny Green into the lineup."
$2 Cade Cunningham 20-25  $4 Donovan Mitchell 25-30  $2 OG Anunoby 24-29  $3 Jerami Grant 27-32  $4 Bam Adebayo 24-29  I went for youth and versatility.  this list was tough.

KAT‚Äôs behind donovan mitchell
I think he just happened to be photobombing Donovan Mitchell at the time.
im a donovan mitchell fan so i tune in frequently. i‚Äôve seen enough. just remember this convo when rudy gets exposed again.
"Last year: Grizzlies/Clippers The year before: Nuggets The year before that: Rockets The year before that: Thunder/Rockets The year before that: Warriors  Donovan Mitchell wasn't even on the team yet, lmao.  Also, Harden shot worse in that series than almost any other playoff series, so take that as you will."
"Yep, a big reason why I admire Donovan Mitchell so much. He's improved his game every season so far. His scouting strengths were more about his defense. He was second in scoring for the 2nd half of the season last year at 29.6 ppg."
"I'm a little ahead, so if you don't mind spoilers, Ben gets a power-up in a later arc after it's revealed he was under mind control from Donovan Mitchell the last 3 years."
Is Donovan Mitchell worth $0?
"No this is way more legit than some of the stuff he pulls saying stuff like ‚Äúhey looks like Donovan Mitchell is great and one of the best players in that years draft, just like I predicted and was telling everyone‚Äù while never saying anything like that before"
"Watching him in the playoffs, I came away thinking he was kind of inconsistent. If he could work on that and improving his scoring in general and/or work on his defense, then he could be top 15.   I have him at 20  11.Damien Lillard   12.Jayson Tatum  13.Donovan Mitchell   14.Kyrie Irving   15.Chris Paul   16.Jimmy Butler  17.Trae Young  18.Paul George   19.Zach Lavine   20.Devin Booker  21.Bradley Beal   And you could even make the case that Beal is better than him. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs better than anyone in the top 15 personally. Even if you think he‚Äôs better than Chris Paul, there are still the players from 16-19 that have a case to be over him."
Using SI's rankings which has Ben at 21:  PG Jamal Murray  SG Donovan Mitchell  SF Khris Middleton  PF Ben Simmons  C Zion Williamson  **Bench**  Russell Westbrook  Kyle Lowry  Trae Young  Jaylen Brown  Brandon Ingram  Nikola Vucevic  Kristaps Porzingis
"Honestly....Zion, Donovan Mitchell and a third feels most probable."
Donovan &gt;&gt; Mitchell and its NOT EVEN CLOSE.  üëäüëä‚òùÔ∏è
"Starters: PG: Kemba Walker SG: Donovan Mitchell SF: Tobias Harris PF: Jonathan Isaac C: Thomas Bryant  2nd Unit: PG: James Bouknight (Ik he‚Äôs technically a SG but I couldn‚Äôt find any other PG‚Äôs besides Kemba currently in the NBA) SG: Kevin Huerter SF: Danny Green PF: Carmelo Anthony C: Isaiah Stewart  Not an awful team you ask me. Probably gets a spot as a top 6 seed in the playoffs imo. Now, if you include the NYC metropolitan area than you could throw in Bam Adebayo, Karl Anthony Towns, Kyrie Irving and Jaren Jackson Jr. (all from north Jersey) and now this team is by far the best team in the NBA, but I decided not to do it since technically speaking they aren‚Äôt from NY and since it‚Äôd be pretty much impossible to afford all those players too being that would be 5 max contracts and a bunch of players making over the vet minimum, but god damn is the NYC metropolitan area stacked with talent now that I look into it."
Less playoff success than Donovan Mitchell
"Donovan Mitchell over Booker. Or the other way around.  If it were not even close, we wouldn‚Äôt be getting the exact same threads every week."
Everyone who said they'd rather have Ben Simmons over Donovan Mitchell
"Donovan Mitchell stops in the middle of his FT routine halfway through the 3rd: ‚ÄúBro I get it, please stop.‚Äù"
No Donovan Mitchell? Flawed list.
"Honestly, that's why I'm taking Anthony Edwards over KAT. Joe Ingles over Donovan Mitchell. It's not ultimately who's the BEST player. Gotta look at the group on the floor.   Run Dame at PG, Ant at SG, SGA at F, Jingles at F and Joker at C."
I would say the dark horse contender for MVP is Donovan Mitchell. Jazz is a team built for the regular season so if he improves and takes his game to the next level he will definitely be in the conversation.
"I say Donovan Mitchell, surprised he wasn‚Äôt in any of the comments"
Donovan Mitchell
Would u argue its Donovan Mitchell?
I see a lot of Donovan Mitchell in him.
He‚Äôs a good player and could be a 3rd option for a contending team. I can‚Äôt help but feel it‚Äôs a huge overpay though. These sort of deals are for young franchise players like Donovan Mitchell or Tatum but not a 3rd option who can‚Äôt play-make or defend.   Maybe he will play into his contract but surely they could‚Äôve got him for 5/110-130 but 168 with incentives for 207 is hectic.
"Russell got injured in the bubble, and before that Melo and PG left him to try carry that OKC team against Utah who had rookie Donovan Mitchell shit all over them, Westbrook never was and never will he a flop"
Here is my top 20 list  1. KD 2. Giannis 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Lemickey 5. Steph Curry 6. James Harden 7. Nikola Jokic 8. Luka Doncic 9. Dame Lillard 10. AD 11. Kyrie Irving 12. Jayson Tatum 13. Trae Young 14. D Booker 15. CP3 16. Paul George 17. Jimmy Butler 18. Donovan Mitchell 19. Joel Emfatass 20. Karl Anthony towns
"He‚Äôs close with Donovan Mitchell, and I believe he was also friends with the majority owner, Ryan Smith prior to his buying in."
"True, Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell were fantastic picks."
Donovan Mitchell was robbed!!!
"He didn't. He traded a pick that was used for Donovan Mitchell for Lyles and #24, to get OG Anonuby. OG was drafted 23rd."
Worst draft decision he made was trading donovan mitchell for trey lyles
2016: Henry Ellenson becomes Malik Beasley; Michael Gbinijie becomes  Georges Niang  2017: Luke Kennard becomes Donovan Mitchell  2018:  Bruce Brown becomes Justin Jackson; Khyri Thomas becomes Isaac Bonga  2019: Sekou Doumbouya becomes Chuma Okeke; Deividas Sirvydis becomes Daniel Gafford  2020: Killian Hayes becomes Obi Toppin; Isaiah Stewart becomes Aleksej Pokusevski; Saddiq Bey becomes Precious Achiuwa; Saben Lee  becomes Elijah Hughes.  \---  We won as soon as we got Donovan Mitchell.
"He had a back strain in that series and so what if they did? MPJ is gonna be better than D Mitch relatively soon, he‚Äôs 6‚Äô10 with good athleticism and you can argue outside of Steph, that he‚Äôs the best 3pt in the league considering how he shoots even when heavily contested and he doesn‚Äôt even have much game experience yet   Donovan Mitchell right now is definitely better than MPJ, he‚Äôs a top 20-top 15 player, but going forward MPJ is gonna easily be better than him. MPJ has the potential to be one of the greatest scorers of all time, this year alone when Murray went out he was dropping 20+ in individual halves like it was nothing. You have to remember that he‚Äôs still gaining experience and that he was projected to go #1 in the draft before his injuries‚Ä¶ there was a reason for that"
Well at least Donovan Mitchell seems like a wonderful guy!
"One of my biggest NBA ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù fantasies is what if Ben doesn‚Äôt get hurt and plays out his rookie year in 2016. Are the sixers still considered Joel‚Äôs team? How do expectations shift if Ben and Embiid debut during the same season? I feel like the entire conversation around the team changes completely if Ben plays that year.   Plus, they‚Äôve never won less than 50 games while playing together, so if they go from 10 wins to 50 in a single year (big if), I think the entire narrative around the process changes as well. I‚Äôm also of the belief that a lot of negative press towards Simmons stems from the ROTY drama w Donovan Mitchell (definitely mot all of the bad press, but I really think that feud had a negative snowball effect), so I wonder how the league wide perception of his capabilities as a player change when he‚Äôs competing against his teammate for that award and doesn‚Äôt have the incentive to really make a spectacle out of it like he and Mitchell did."
"Donovan Mitchell is really bright. Seems to just ""get it"" in a way that a lot of people don't.  That said it's important to only listen to people with actual expertise in things, even if you perceive them as smart."
"Quick question,   This year‚Äòs rookie max is 5 years 207 million while last year players like Donovan Mitchell signed 5 year 196 million max deals. Does Mitchell‚Äôs contract get scaled up to 207 million (30% of the cap) or is he locked in at 196?"
Only other names being thrown around right now are Bradley Beal and Donovan Mitchell. Mostly Mitchell
Donovan ‚ÄúThe Third Option‚Äù Mitchell

Donovan ‚ÄúWalking Bucket‚Äù Mitchell
"The call was made by the training staff. That is their decision.  I don't know who is in charge of the messaging. Technically, what the Jazz did was illegal by not disclosing the injury on the injury report. He wasn't even listed. Beyond the injury report, someone needed to tell the coaches/players that there was a chance he might not be ready to play. That was a serious organizational failure, can't have that.   Someone had to take the fall for that. It doesn't surprise me it was this guy. The other thing is that this wasn't just a ""rushing him back to quickly"" thing. Mitchell didn't think he was making progress with the team trainer and got his own trainer to do rehab. So while the team trainer might have been correct in insisting that Mitchell wasn't ready to go, Mitchell already had belief that the trainer wasn't in his best interest during rehab.  Was Mitchell right about that last part? I don't know, but a trainer is more replaceable than Donovan Mitchell is."
Because Tyronn Lue literally said he was trying to wear Curry down. Donovan Mitchell gets a pass for his choke last playoffs for the same reason.
"Lmao. At so much of this.   A) There is a reason I said ""OLD"" Westbrook. He is not the same player he was several years ago. His shooting splits have been straight trash in recent years and it turns him into a liability at the end of games and in the playoffs. 44/32/66-- that's what he shot last year.  And yes, he was hurt for part of that. Something I will bring up in regards to Murray in a second. But even if we qualify by saying the 2nd half of the season-- it was 45/33/68. That year in Houston you point to?  He was at 47/26/76 AND the team literally gave Capella away to make Westbrooks lack of a jumper less problematic.   B) ""Nobody is underrating Murray"".. then proceeds to say: ""He just isn't very good"" &amp; ""the only thing he has going for him is the 2020 playoffs"".    The Nuggets have won more games than any team in the NBA over the past 3 seasons. If you include the playoffs, only the Bucks have won more.  This is despite the Nuggets being one of the youngest teams in the league during a solid chunk of that success. They have never lost in the 1st round.   I'm sorry, but that doesn't just happen because of Jokic. It is also because Murray has been very good (especially for his age) and very adaptable during that stretch. Which, yes, includes a willingness to take a backseat to Jokic.  He averaged 21 PPG last year and 5 assists (your BS shows in the fact that he has been at 4.8 assists 3 years running and yet you round down)-- his age 23 season-- on 48/41/87.  Now consider-- Murray had spent the entire off-season rehabbing from the hamstring injury he suffered against the Lakers and then dealt with a bunch of injuries during the first month or so of the season.  But once he got healthy, he averaged 23 and 5 on 50/45/92 over the two month, 30ish game stretch before he got hurt.  So basically-- bubble Murray numbers.   C) Young players take time to develop. And roles vary depending on roster construction. The past year of Murray's career-- as an older 22 year old, and 23 year old-- has been VERY good no matter how you slice it. He's been drastically more efficient that both a player like Donovan Mitchell (who, yes, has a roll as the #1 scorer on a very good team) much less Westbrook. The fact that he is willing to pick his spots to shoot is an asset even if people like you hold it against him.  D) KD would have one a championship in OKC if Westbrook had better shot selection in the clutch. I'll go to my grave believing that.   E) Murray is a better defender that Westbrook. He gets torched by small, quick PG's like Fox but is pretty solid against SG's and has even learned to hold his own against wings in the mid-post. Westbrook is a bad defender all around at this point. Murray is also substantially better off ball-- things like setting screens or stretching the opposing D."
"Luka has been 1 and done in the playoffs though. If 1 playoff series is enough, Donovan Mitchell last year looked like a god and Damian Lillard is the best player in the NBA this series. Trae Young has better TS than Luka if you average out the three years Luka only was more efficient his rookie year than Trae."
The Clippers would love it if he stayed a prominent rotational piece and nothing more. Don't let a playoff series against a team with unathletic perimeter defense and Donovan Mitchell on one foot let you think Mann has more of an upside.
"Or it showed that the Clippers were a much better team than the Mavs overall. The Clippers proceeded to beat the Jazz without Kawhi despite Donovan Mitchell having a monster series, does that mean the Jazz also have some deeply flawed roster construction?"
"Nah shaq will say a lot of basic stuff as wel l while perk‚Äôs dumbass takes are constant. Not that Shaq couldn‚Äôt learn from this tweet as well. Between th Luka triple double, donovan mitchell interview, and being petty af to most big men shaw has his fair share of whack and unprofessional shit that he‚Äôs said"
"Aside from those two? In the last playoff run, Giannis, arguably Luka (though he wore down in 4th quarters a case could be made he was more consistent over those 7 games than Kawhi was in this last series and honestly the bubble series too). Straight up - Jokic was better than Kawhi in that series they played vs Denver, full stop (and has better career playoff numbers than Kawhi so far through his career).  Donovan Mitchell is debatable but an argument could be made (offensively - certainly not defensively). Steph Curry no questions asked.  Then in the years he was with the Spurs except for the year he got hurt he wasnt even the first option, really - they were still Duncan's team, and then they were the egalitarian beautiful game Spurs, then they were Kawhi's team but he was by no means an ""all time"" offensive player at that time (or any other time). Then in the series vs the 73 win Dubs he got hurt.  But even if it's a short list of players right now, that *does not mean he's an all time great offensive player*. Even after winning the title in Toronto, literally no one was saying ""oh he's now the/a GOAT."" People were saying he was perhaps the best two way player in the game at that point, but those are two different things. He's not close to being up there with MJ, Shaq, Kareem, Hakeem, Magic, Bird, LeBron, or any of those guys who were/are an offense unto themselves. Kawhi's turned himself into a great scorer, and in the last two years, a pretty solid passer. In his prime he was one of the top 5 players in the NBA (not really sure we can say he will be the same with another serious injury on him now, and he hasnt been a top 5 player for the last two years, partly due to availability, partly due to other guys). But again - that doesnt mean he was or is an all time great offensive player. Great, yes. All time? No."
"It was a story Donovan Mitchell himself told, there's been multiple articles written about that interview he gave to to ESPN. Wether you believe Donovan's story or not, its not really a stain on sports journalism in any way, it's just a funny story Mitchell told, it's up to the general public wether they want to believe a funny story about when he was like 12 or 13 years old"
"he has the DPOY and the 6MOTY with a star player in Donovan Mitchell, how is the second round ‚Äúoverachieving‚Äù?"
"People carry their weight different. Jrue is a big 6'3 and built upper and lower body. He def around 220-225. Donovan Mitchell is 6'1 with a near 7ft wingspan, size 17 shoes and weighs 225."
Lol remember when half this sub thought he deserved ROTY over Donovan Mitchell?
"I'd put him in the Devin Booker/Donovan Mitchell tier. Great scorer, not great at anything else but not awful either."
"Team Adidas. Trae is a great foul baiter, Donovan Mitchell is built like a tank, and Evan Mobley is a better defender than Rui Hachimura."
Some were still vehemently going at Donovan Mitchell in game threads this past season for some reason. It was weird
Donovan Mitchell
Some players I like on teams I generally root against:  T Mann on the Clips  PJ Tucker on the Heat  Lebron on the Lakers  Donovan Mitchell on the Jazz
Donovan Mitchell
"this feels like more of a dig at Simmons than Donovan lol, ""Ben Simmons is the worst playoff performer and gets carried to more series wins than Donovan Mitchell"""
"And if donovan mitchell, a non top 15 player, is their best player, they do? Lol"
[Tell Mitchell that](https://www.nba.com/news/donovan-mitchell-trolls-ben-simmons-simmons-pre-game-rookie-hoodie)
got destroyed by a rookie donovan mitchell and clowned by joe ingles.
"""Top picks"" are overrated, first of all.    Of the past 100 top 10 draft picks ( 2009-2019 draftees ), the only 5 to even reach the Finals with their draft team are: Harrison Barnes, Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, James Harden, and Stephen Curry. And two of those wouldn't have made it without a certain free-agent acquisition.  So while building a winner high in the draft is a nice idea, its recent track record is bleak, at best.  The preceding decade was just a little better, with 7 out of 100: Westbrook, Durant, Bynum, Howard, Wade, Kenyon Martin, and Paul Pierce.  Of those 12 players, only 5 were top 3 picks and just 3 were first overall -- over 20 years.  Mediocre teams have a path to contention, and we've seen it.  It's disturbingly simple.  You build your team by drafting the best players that you can, wherever your picks fall, and by making smart trades for better players, or players that fit better.  When a ""star"" player becomes available, as they often do, you trade some of those assets for that player.  Toronto did this.  Miami did this.  Milwaukee did this.  Denver did this.  Utah did this.  None of them tanked, and none of them relied on top picks or huge free agent signings\*.  Every team in the league passed on those teams' key players in the draft.  So invest in your scouting and development operations and draft better if you want to win.  If that fails, swindle  other teams by pulling trades like Donovan Mitchell for Tyler Lydon and Trey Lyles.  &amp;#x200B;  \*Yes, Butler signed in Miami, but he also signed with Philadelphia which is not exactly South Beach, and had no problem playing in Minnesota -- and Jimmy never leaves the gym anyway."
The only way possible is 2 opposite players are both hot and keep the game close the entire time. Like Donovan Mitchell vs Murray .
When tf was Donovan Mitchell in the mvp race and supposed to be the best player on a team that is gonna have to beat the nets. Higher expectations need to be met with higher quality play
Where‚Äôs everyone saying this when Donovan Mitchell does the same thing
"I don‚Äôt disagree with what you just said and I‚Äôm not advocating Mitchell for MVP. It‚Äôs the amount of disrespect he still gets from the majority that I was pointing out. Literally only 2 players have NOT won mvp with the stats he‚Äôs putting up while being the best team in the league. Again Donovan SHOULDN‚ÄôT win it this year, but he should be talked about as an elite guard because he is"
Do people even read what‚Äôs written in these posts or just see ‚ÄúDonovan Mitchell‚Äù and ‚ÄúMVP‚Äù in the same sentence and lose there mind. I posted a stat that I saw and literally said that I didn‚Äôt think Donovan should win MVP.
"Man, I really like what Donovan Mitchell brings to the table, but  - he‚Äôs not even a top-10 player in the league - in the West alone, he‚Äôs not even a top-5 guard (Curry, Lillard, Luka, CP3, PG13) - he‚Äôs not even the best player on the team, and it‚Äôs not like Gobert is a top-5/10 player in the league either  Can‚Äôt seriously consider him an MVP candidate tbh."
"1. Stephen Curry: Literally the reason I got into basketball was Curry during the 2014-15 run. Then at the beginning of 2015-16 I became a massive fan of the Warriors solely cuz of Curry. I still watch almost every Warriors game cuz of Curry, and he is the reason I care about basketball tbh. Watching the 35 ft game winner live is one of my most cherished memories, I literally ran throughout my house screaming for a minute straight when it went in. 2. Kobe Bryant: My dad used to be a Laker fan back in the Magic era and until basically they sucked (not his fault he stopped watching, my mom refused to watch the Lakers get trashed often at some point lol). I could only watch him near the end of the his career, but he was my favorite player back when I didn't know much about basketball. 3. Klay Thompson: I will never forget Game 6 vs OKC, that was one of the greatest performances in NBA history imo. He is the quintissential 3 point shooter imo, his three point shot is the most perfect form I have ever seen. 4. Damian Lillard: Dame is very similar to Curry in play-style. I just love his ""Logo Lillard"" shots and overall clutch-ness. 5. Zach Lavine: Between his athleticism and his shooting, his game is so asthetically pleasing to me. I really hope he and Vuc have a fruitful career together in Chicago and maybe even win a ring, two of my fav players in the league rn. 6. Kyrie Irving: Off the court he is pretty stupid, but his game is super asthetically pleasing imo. His handles are literally insane, I love when he fakes defenders really badly. 7. Ja Morant: His athleticism is INSANE!!! I hope he develops a 3 point shot to improve. 8. Nikola Vuƒçeviƒá: Overall as you can probably tell from this list, I'm not a big fan of most forwards/centers. I like Vucevic because he doesn't just play bully ball and flop around in the post like a lot of other players, his game is so smooth imo. 9. Lamelo Ball: The flashiness! His passing is so cool, I hope he blossoms into a superstar. 10. Kemba Walker: I always loved Kemba with the Hornets. I know he wasn't ever particularly efficient, but to me his game is pretty asthetically pleasing as well.  HM: De'Aaron Fox, CJ McCollum, Kevin Durant, Vince Carter, Damion Lee, Kent Bazemore, Donovan Mitchell, Tony Parker, Pau Gasol, Rajon Rondo, David West, Wilt Chamberlain (or the idea of him, I obv didn't watch him play but the mystery about him is so interesting to me. Also I think he would literally be a god-level player in today's league)  So overall, I love shooters and explosive guards more than any other types of players. I'd love to discuss this more to, if you have any questions feel free to ask!"
"Donovan Mitchell doesn't have much help? He's only on the best team in the league? Even if you just mean offensively, having a borderline all star pure pg, a lob threat center, and multiple shooting forwards is more help than most 2s dream of    People rarely have mvp lists longer than 3 players, so anything after that is usually pointless."
Remember when Donovan Mitchell got mad at Rudy for the whole COVID thing like he was the sole reason the NBA shut down
Best league ever  1 - Anthony Davis + LeBron James  2 - Giannis Antetokounmpo + Luka Doncic  3 - Joel Embiid + James Harden  4 - Nikola Jokic + Kawhi Leonard  5 - Kevin Durant + Steph Curry  6 - Rudy Gobert + Jimmy Butler + Damian Lilard  7 - Bam Adebayo + Paul George + Kyrie Irving  8 - Karl Anthony Towns + Jayson Tatum + Ben Simmons  9 - Draymond Green + Devin Booker + Chris Paul  10 - Kristaps Porzingis + Zion Williamson + Donovan Mitchell  11 - Clint Capela + Jaylen Brown + Bradley Beal
"I'm a huge Ringer fan. An even bigger Jazz fan (since the days of, like, Stockton/Malone versus Magic/Kareem!)   And clearly Donovan, Rudy and the gang are doing better than expected this season (though let's avoid the recent heroball syndrome - how 'bout a pass before the 5th shot Mitchell takes!)   BUT   There is *no* way that Jazz 36%, Nets 8%, Lakers 3% title odds are defensible."
"If Donovan Mitchell won the mvp award this year, he'd have, statistically, the worst mvp winning season in the last 50 years."
"This is assuming Gobert was *available* for trade.   I know everybody is technically always available but there's no way the Jazz are trading Mitchell/Gobert unless they are going full rebuild. Losing Gobert would've set us back 5 years, so at that point you might as well trade Donovan too."
He said in his rookie year where he averaged just as much that he was a scorer and that‚Äôs why he should be ROTY over Donovan Mitchell.
for donovan mitchell when we need him you have a deal
Wdym his team was without two of their beat wing defenders in Gary Harris and Will Barton playing Donovan Mitchell
Lmfao Lebron and AD as DPOY candidates is like Donovan Mitchell being an MVP candidate.
While also guarding Donovan Mitchell for a majority of the game.   You can never escape the Dorture Chamber.
"Look at past drafts:   2018: Ayton v. SGA 2017: Fultz v. Donovan Mitchell or Bam 2016: Simmons v. Sabonis 2015: KAT v Devin Booker 2014: Wiggins v Jokic 2013: Anthony Bennet v. Giannis 2012: AD v Draymond 2011: Kyrie v Kawhi 2010: John Wall v Paul George   I‚Äôd take the 10th pick in 2018, 2017, 2014, 2013, 2011, 2010.    2015 is a wash"
Mike Conley   Donovan Mitchell   Royce O‚ÄôNeal  Bojan Bogdanovic   Rudy Gobert
"PG still having nightmares about Joe Ingles and the Playoff series against the Jaz. Crazy that Donovan Mitchell was a rookie and led the Jazz to a 4-2 victory over Russ, PG, and Melo."
"Also, Luka gets double teamed more than any other player in basketball (this year at least). You would not have the luxury of double teaming him on a team that also includes Donovan Mitchell. The perimeter scoring would be insane for the Jazz and essentially unstoppable considering that they are already the best 3 pt shooting team in the league."
Because the Pistons drafted him. Sometimes it‚Äôs that simple. The Detroit franchise drafted Stanley Johnson and Luke Kennard over Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell in successive drafts. The Pistons draft the wrong guys. It‚Äôs what they do.
i thought donovan mitchell was playing.
translation: Devin Booker &gt; Donovan Mitchell
It‚Äôs Donovan Mitchell 100%
"KAT is not better than Zion, Donovan Mitchell, Tatum, and a few others."
"Yeah I mean my point isnt really to get into the specifics of who's better Trae vs Capela it doesnt matter to me(I do actually think it's still Trae). Point is more it's an actual convo and the fact that's the case is what's driving their success. It's a watered down version of Donovan Mitchell vs Rudy Gobert even if in Utah's case I think Gobert is better. This is basically the actualized version of him yeah, kind of tailor made for a role of turning a bad/mediocre team into an above average one. He's the only reason this defense isnt a total abomination."
Drummond is not a quality option. You are delusional if you think Rudy fucking Gobert and Donovan Mitchell are going to be competitive against LeBron James and Anthony Davis.
Donovan Mitchell scored 25 on 29 shots
You make a trade if the guy you want is still on the board. So if someone was really eying Donovan Mitchell and saw he was still on the board the trade is executed. This way they aren‚Äôt stuck with a pick they traded for and end up not getting the guy they wanted. You also don‚Äôt have to give up as many assets if it‚Äôs a later draft pick and the guy fell in drafts.
lmao this whole sub was nothing but people gushing over donovan mitchell for roty why y‚Äôall gotta change history
"Same reason Chris Paul, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, and Rudy Gobert aren't. He isn't good enough. No way MVP can be like the 15th best player"
"&gt;When he left the game, we went on runs. When he came back in, runs ended.  and yet Harden's net rating for the series was +15.0 per 48 and cp3's was +8.3.  and that's including games 6 and 7 in cp3's off time.  in the 5 games he actually played (i.e. when he was stopping all those runs), his net rating was -1.0 per 48.  the rockets were a ridiculous -21 per 48 when harden didn't play.    &gt;Harden had 3 playoffs that were good statistically, but well below his normal performance level, especially against good teams. He played worse than in the regular season, and got fewer stats in more minutes.   apparently it's a problem that's going around, because harden played 7 series the last 3 years and led both teams in game score in 6 of those series.  so if his numbers and play were dropping off, they were somehow staying above some really good players.  that's 2 series against KD, 2 against steph, 1 against lebron, 1 against AD, 2 more against donovan mitchell, 1 against cp3, and 5 with cp3 as a teammate.  KD is 3rd in history by leading 55% of his series in game score so that shows how tough leading 6 out of 7 series at any point is.   &gt;Jimmy never made it out of the second round because he'd never been on a team that should have. He was the best player in the playoffs on a squad that had Embiid, Simmons, no coach and negative spacing.   and because he's never been a top 10 player.  teams led by non-top 10 guys tend to struggle to get out of the 2nd round.  we're not going to rewrite history because of how good jimmy was in last year's playoffs.  something tells me if harden averaged 19/6/5 on that philly team, you wouldn't be here singing his praises.  harden loses to a 4 hall-of-famer juggernaut due to an injury and you can barely bring yourself to say anything good about it.  &gt;If you need a basket in a tight game, he can get it.  it's not just that he didn't get out of the 2nd round in the east, he didn't get out of the 1st on 4 occasions and missed the playoffs on another.  no one is saying he isn't good, but the myth that jimmy butler can just will he and his team to greatness just because he was great in last year's playoffs is not well-supported by history."
"Or Donovan Mitchell, John Collins, and OG"
"John Collins, Bam, Donovan Mitchell. For fucks sake Neil"
Lots of stars aren't close with each other like that. Steph and Klay are basically opposite people in their personal lives and aren't very close off the court. Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell aren't best buds or anything either. Same with Simmons and Embiid.
"That's not a fair comparison. Just look at coach K's rosters. He had all the top US born players playing for him. Kobe, Lebron, Curry, AD, Melo, Harden, Westbrook, Chris Paul.   Almost all of the top 10 US NBA players aren't on the team this year. No Lebron, no Curry, no Leonard, no Harden, no Davis, no Paul George. Even the next generation of younger guys like Donovan Mitchell, Zion, and Trae Young are absent. Of the players Pop does have, three of them literally just arrived in Tokyo on Saturday. Not to mention the COVID of it all.   It's still a talented group, but comparing this team USA to what coach K had to work with is not fair at all."
"This same exact block of text was written in 2004.   &gt;Yeah you can argue they are not as stacked as they could be  Folks seem to gloss over this as though it's an afterthought but this is how it's been for decades now. If Team USA doesn't send the best of the best, things can get variably dicey.   Everyone was convinced the world had not only caught up to the USA, but perhaps even surpassed them in the mid-2000's. Then when USA got their minds right and actually sent the cavalry the next time out (2008), we got original Dream Team types of results.   Circumstances are different this year because so many stars are out with injuries (as opposed to just opting out like they did in the 2000's). But you can't leave these guys at home...  * LeBron James  * Stephen Curry  * Anthony Davis  * Klay Thompson  * Kyrie Irving  * James Harden  * Donovan Mitchell   * Paul George  * Kawhi Leonard  ... and then turn around and casually be like, ""I know we didn't send our best but still."" There's literally a Dream Team sitting home and for a long time now, when those guys aren't in the fold, nothing's a sure thing."
"Starting 5:  Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, Evan Mobley  Bench: Cade Cunninghan, Mikal Bridges, Bam Adebayo, Ja Morant, Jaylen Brown, De‚ÄôAndre Hunter, Kevin Durant (will be like Melo in 2016)  Coach:  Pop, Monty, Kerr, Spo"

"Reminds me of France-USA at the FIBA world cup 2019.  Donovan Mitchell was on fire, but Kemba Walker didn‚Äôt pass the ball to him, because he wanted to be the man on that team himself.  France won and eliminated the USA"
Nuggets also traded Donovan Mitchell for Tyler Lydon and Trey Lyles.
You're a jazz fan that doesn't like Donovan Mitchell?!?!?!
Idk what it is but I do not like Donovan Mitchell.
Remember in the FIBA championships when we went away from a red hot Donovan Mitchell and instead forced it through an ice cold Kemba? That's when I became disillusioned with Pop's current international coaching ability
You probably don‚Äôt watch much international basketball either cuz the US sent D list stars in 2019. The best players on that team were legit young Donovan Mitchell and jayson tatum
"Ordinary FIBA Mills statline. I honestly see no reason why he can't have a Donovan Mitchell type role on a high tier playoff team, only thing is Pop holding him back with the Spurs system."
"I'm guessing that American Football Quarterbacks and fit baseball players would be about as good as the average NBA player because of throwing accuracy and strength, but the NBA players who used to be Quarterbacks or baseball players would probably be best of all.  In light of that, I would say Donovan Mitchell (elite baseball fielder), Pat Connaughton (elite baseball pitcher), and Jalen Suggs (elite high school quarterback) would be the best.  Jokic can definitely throw and catch from his water polo days, but he's too lumbering.  And gotta include LeBron because of the unusual combination of agility with his size, and we already know he can catch anything."
Thon maker is supposedly the same age as Donovan Mitchell (His listed age has been questioned before tho)
"No offense but Pistons had multiple opportunities to get out of that hole, but they consistently drafted terribly with picks like Stanley Johnson over Booker and Luke Kennard over Donovan Mitchell among many others. I trust that the Spurs could find a star in the mid first round eventually."
"Going bold  **Jayson Tatum** \- Best 2-way player in the NBA  **Luka Doncic** \- In the middle of his prime, probably doing historical things  **Zion Williamson** \- One of the most dominant drivers to the rim ever, hes gonna be a monster scorer in his prime  **Giannis Antetokounmpo** \- In the Latter half of his prime, but still doing Giannis things  **Trae Young** \- Arguably the best Scorer in the NBA  **Anthony Edwards** \- He will be having crazy scoring seasons and his frame makes him a scary slasher at the rim  **Paolo Banchero** \- Bold take, I think its the #1 pick in 2022 Draft, he will be a dominant 2-way player like AD  **Cade Cunningham** \- 2-Way Superstar, best playmaker in the league   **Donovan Mitchell** \- In the midst of his prime, I think he shifts into taking less drives and shooting more.  **Jalen Green** \- Explosive Young PG like athlete, he develops into a 2-Way Superstar as well  &amp;#x200B;  HM: Ja Morant, Devin Booker, Emoni Bates, Jaden Hardy, Lamelo Ball"
"yeah man. I wanted to tank but people can't act like tanking has helped anybody but the Suns all that much. I'm sorry Kings and Wolves fans, but I'm pretty content as it is. Devin Booker, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis, and Donovan Mitchell were late lottery picks. it's not the worst thing in the world.   all we have to do is let DeMar go and we're gonna go from the 12 pick to top 7 almost unless someone takes a big step which would be what we want anyway. lol"
"I‚Äôd argue that the Clippers do let opposing guards score much higher than you‚Äôd expect. Donovan Mitchell was lighting them up too, Book had a couple big scoring games. Kawhi held Luka to under 40% while guarding him, but he won‚Äôt guard him a whole game, because of screens, play design etc. Luka at 9 is the right move IMO"
"That‚Äôs fair. Maybe was reading to much into this post. I just wonder about the reaction to certain similar observations on here. Take these:  Trae and Lebron are tied for most games these past 2 postseasons with at least 10 assists - 8 of them. After him is Jrue, followed by a tie between CP3 and Luka at 6 and so on. This past year (regular/play in/postseason), there were only 6 guys with at least 25 10 assists games. Westbrook had 56 games, Trae had 36, CP3 had 35, Harden had 31, Jokic had 29, and Draymond had 25.  Donovan Mitchell has the most 45 plus playoff games in the last 2 postseasons (17 games played) with 3 then Murray/KD with 2, then Dame/Booker/Ja/Giannis/Tatum/Kawhi/Trae/Luka with 1.  Of guys drafted from 2014 on (below the minimum years to qualify for a higher max due to vet status until now), Tatum has the most 50 point games with 4. 3 for Booker/Murray, 2 for Mitchell, 1 for LeVert/D‚ÄôAngelo/FVV/Embiid/KAT/KPJ/Jokic/Warren/Trae/LaVine and none for anybody else.  I may very well be wrong but I feel like the reaction to these would be more critical and defensive with people focused on how Mitchell/Trae/Tatum isn‚Äôt as good as x player(s) even though such a thing was never mentioned. Especially given how I‚Äôve seen people to respond to posts that either don‚Äôt mention Luka or mention a statistic that on it‚Äôs own makes other players look better though theres no claim that‚Äôs the case just like here."
Patrick Beverly is such a terrible comparison though. He is going top 8 no question because he is that special.  Consensus top 8. He is at the very least a good scorer on the NBA level and will be a great defender. Patrick Beverly is a good defender but he has trouble on defense where Davion doesn't. Davion is like a Lugentz Dort-level defender with the offense potential of Donovan Mitchell. He can fight through screens can switch regardless of size and is way more disciplined that Pat Bev. Pat Bev is mostly heart while Davion is almost all skill defensively. Also this is why he fits yalls timeline. At the very worst he's an amazing 6th man and a specialist defender. Hes going top 10 for a reason if you watch more than just highlights you would see that the way he gets his shots are consistent enough to show its not a fluke. He figured his game out. He may not have the ceilings Cade has but he's the best available guard to yall. OKC is taking Bouknight. Davion is an experienced guard with still a ton of ceiling offensively and will immediately be one of the best defensive guards in the NBA period.
So Russ/Dame aren‚Äôt an honorable mention but Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker are
Donovan Mitchell is better
Donovan Mitchell getting no respect like usual
"The Tyler Lydon pick in 2017. While he was drafted 24th, Denver had eyes on OG Anunoby, and traded back from the 13th spot (which became Donovan Mitchell) to 24, picked up Trey Lyles from Utah as the compensation to move down, then watched OG go 23rd to the Raptors. Lydon was out of the league in 2 years and Lyles was nothing more than an end of bench guy. Yuck."
Donovan Mitchell‚Äôs sister is also Donovan mitchell
"I just had a baby Monday I believe he too, is Donovan Mitchell."
They also drafted both Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell... And then proceeded to trade those picks to Utah.
The disrespect to Donovan Mitchell.
Both of you are spelling his name wrong. It‚Äôs Donovan Mitchell.
"I don't think an inch or two makes that much difference. The wingspan, reach and frame are the key elements to look at with players. Donovan Mitchell is only 6ft, but has a 6'10 wingspan, a massive frame, he weighs like 225 and still looks pretty lean. He wears size 17 shoes and has massive hands. He is a big guard, even though he is just 6ft."
"Yeah. Donovan Mitchell is an elite 3pt shooter. He can make it from DEEP, pull up off the dribble, falling away, catch and shoot.  But he gets the hardest possessions when the Jazz motion offence clogs up and he has to produce a basket from his asshole.  So his shooting splits aren't as impressive. But Mark my words the kid is a sniper."
"Sound ridiculous but Donovan Mitchell has a good chance to finish top 3 in mvp voting. His Team will have a top 4 seeding in the west, Mitchell‚Äôs improved 3point shooting will help boost his pts/per game to the 28-31 range on 60% ts, and Rudy‚Äôs under performance in the playoffs ended the talks of him being better than Donovan (narrative wise)."
Donovan Mitchell
"From the Jazz end, in this video, we got  * Shaq ""challenging"" Mitchell (boo) * Donovan and Gobert getting picked last for the All-Star game and LeBron making his statement about the Jazz (boo) * Conley losing the 3 point contest to a late Curry flurry (boo) * Gobert big block on Jokic leading to Clarkson 3 (yay) * Mann and the Clippers ending our season (boo)  Not depicted  * Gobert denies an attempted Ja Morant assassination (Ja keeps trying, respect) * Gobert's block on Marcus Morris * John Stockton doing his research (thank goodness)  It was just that type of season."
"Game 4 Anthony Davis didn't play a single second of the second half. The Lakers were easily more injured at that point. Davis had 6 points total in that game. Meanwhile CP3 has 18 points in that game. He got healthier as the series went on.  &gt; The Lakers started with the type of ""minor injury that he played through, like damn near everyone in the playoffs does""  I don't this is the case for Lebron. Lebron will play through anything in the playoffs. Being available for his team in the playoffs is one of his proudest achievements. Donovan Mitchell missed Game 1 of his series with a high ankle sprain for instance. Lebron played through his high ankle sprain. It's not a coincidence Lebron has never missed a playoff game and it's not just genetics and luck. He has forced himself out there when others would not. Every other star player has missed playoffs games: Kawhi, Kd, Steph, Harden, Giannis, Lillard, Paul, Embid, Young etc. And those guys are babies who have barely played compared to Lebron.  &gt;The Lakers stars, despite not being 100%, still averaged more than 20 points apiece through 3 games until AD had that injury.  It was also the absolute worst playoff series Anthony Davis has ever played. And the absolute worse or 2nd worst (behind 2011 finals) for Lebron.   &gt;The Lakers were always going to be top heavy.  Right, so an injury to their guys hurts the team more."
This is the same Donovan Mitchell argument. Nobody knew what he was going to be until he was what he is now. Anyone arguing that they knew is a liar.
"Nuggets would have:  Nikola Jokic  Rudy Gobert  Donovan Mitchell  Jamal Murray   Evan Fournier   With Melo, Michael Porter Jr.,  Monte Morris and Manimal in the rotation"
"While Booker doesn't shoot a high percentage, no one should actually doubt his shooting ability. Therefore no team would guard him any less tight than they would someone like Donovan Mitchell who shot well over 40% from 3.   Just because his team has spacing and Chris Paul doesn't mean he's getting open shots in comparison to his peers."
"That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs good to use more words, to add nuance.  Especially with shooting too many people rely on 3P% alone (maybe 3PA) and don‚Äôt look at the context of those shots, nor at how defences respond to the threat (crucial for spacing - you‚Äôre not providing spacing if a defender doesn‚Äôt stay on you, regardless of the %).  Let‚Äôs look at Lonzo[‚Äòs stats](https://go.nba.com/o72z): * 5.9 attempts a game are after 0 dribbles at 40.4% * 2.4 attempts a game after 1 or more dribbles at 31.3%  He‚Äôs a threat in the same way Royce O‚ÄôNeale is, as a C&amp;S shooter (a bit more than that), but not in the same way Donovan Mitchell is as a pull-up shooter."
"What about half the league being crippled this season? You seriously don't think that Kawhi, AD, Harden, Kyrie, Donovan Mitchell, Jamal Murray playing is going to change the competitiveness of the season? Guess winning really does fix everything"
Wildcard pick is Donovan Mitchell
Donovan Mitchell to Damien lillard
Donovan Mitchell - D.Wade
Donovan Mitchell for Trey Lyles and Tyler Lydon or Rudy Gobert for Erick Green and Cash considerations
"Absolutely the wrong way to look at it.   Imagine your the hot new copper welder. There are plenty of great welders and you are already electric. Tackling jobs at a similar rate as the guy before you. You respect the man who comes before you, but instead of help, this man just sends jabs and such, you are still playing again him.  Now Imagine if you took the nickname to get back at him for the insults and for a welding competition. and call yourself that after a sick ass job. And because of that, the old man insults you on facebook every day. He degrades you, tells you that you'll never be him. A generational welder.   The bottom falls out, you hit your lows...slowly rise to your eventually second peak. Find a place in the welding community. The beef you had with him should be long gone.  INSTEAD THE BEAST OF A MAN IS INSULTING YOU ON LIVE TELEVISION STILL. HE HAS LIKE 50 NICKNAME AND HE GET'S HUNG UP ON A COMIC BOOK HERO? A UNIVERSAL ICON? IMAGINE IF DONOVAN MITCHELL DID IT WITH SPIDERMAN! THERE'S NO AMOUNT OF CLOUT TO EXCUSE THAT.   Shaq's a bitch and you shouldn't be defending him"
Yes but league efficiency at that volume for a 22 year old is great to borderline elite that is only trounced by what all nba players or legit all multi time all stars. Yeah that means teams do not want what CJ McCollum oh wait he got maxed or how about Tobias Harris oh wait he got maxed as well. To say teams do not want scorers unless they are steph curry level efficient  or good is dumb there will always be a hole for efficient scorers like Sexton to get maxed or near maxed it‚Äôs just how the league works. Plus yeah if league average  efficiency isn‚Äôt good enough that‚Äôs the same as saying Donovan Mitchell isn‚Äôt a good enough scorer.
"I don‚Äôt have a team, I will be buying it shortly (Got a Donovan Mitchell jersey earlier this year)"
Donovan Mitchell wins the Suns this series.
"After last night, how can Giannis not be #1.  I threw this together super quick, but I would go:  1. Giannis 2. KD 3. LeBron 4. Luka 5. AD 6. Kawhi (pre-knee injury) 7. Jokic 8. Steph 9. Dame 10. Young 11. Harden 12. Tatum 13. Donovan Mitchell 14. Beal 15. Booker 16. Irving 17. Morant 18. PG13 19. Randle 20. Zion"
Donovan Mitchell and this time he improves his defense
"You can out Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young, Zion WIlliamson, Paul George, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, ect. on the Timberwolves and they will still almost certainly be a Lottery team.  Basketball is a team sport, I find it outrageous to blame the Star for a teams lack of success."
"I mean, not all of them lol. Look right across the court, Giannis is a pretty big scorer and never plays the ""ref-bait"" game. 'Course, he's the Greek God so I doubt he'd get any bites anyways, noone would believe someone of his size actin a fool for fouls.  But even still, there are some high-scoring guards that generally don't buy into this nonsense nearly as much as guys like Booker, CP3, Trae, etc.  Beal, Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, just to name a few in this years playoffs, might try and get some free 3pt FTs time to time but don't try and pull that nonsense literally any time a player jumps within 5ft of them. Or comically flop, etc.  Obviously not many people watch the Kings, but after watching nearly every game of this entire season I didn't see Fox pull that nonsense hardly at all. At most single-digit times on a whole season. And he averaged ~26 w/ multiple 40pt games. He also led the league in 4th quarter pts until he missed the last like 12 or whatever games.  I guess my point is: a) it's definitely not necessary to flop like a fish and bait cheap bullshit in order to be a top scorer; and b) there's levels to this shit and Booker is up there among the worst of them, along with his mentor CP3, Trae Young, Harden, etc."

I just don‚Äôt think people see Utah as having a next level. They were pretty much healthy this year - Mitchell was iffy but showed he was good enough to go - and they still lost to LAC with no Kawhi.   Donovan can hit another level scoring but it was actually their defense that fell apart and guys like Ingles and Conley are aging up. That‚Äôs an uphill battle
Donovan Mitchell better
"Booker is way too overrated. You got media heads saying he could be the next Kobe after every good game, but I see a good mid range but low efficiency scorer who doesn‚Äôt do anything else at an elite level. I‚Äôll even say his defence is lacking. I‚Äôd personally take, Donovan Mitchell and Jason Tatum over him. I think he‚Äôs more in line with Jamal Murray than he is Kobe"
"I remember reading this same comment for years about donovan mitchell, well see how it turns out"
"I remember that season the offensive advanced stats had him as the GOAT, but I think most people weren‚Äôt ready to put him the superstar tier yet. That Nuggets team was more of a well-oiled machine with him as the center piece than a superstar driven team. It‚Äôs similar to this year‚Äôs Donovan Mitchell, because he was putting up great stats but no one had him as an mvp candidate."
"&gt; It will happen to Luka too.  It'll happen to all of them. It'll happen to Tatum, Zion, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, Jokic, and more.  It'll start happening to Dame really damn soon, especially if he gets traded to a contender.  It's still happening to Harden and will only get worse, especially if the Nets are fully healthy and still can't win next season.  It's still happening to Paul George and Russ.  Hell, I've seen people say it about Curry despite 2 MVPs and 3 rings just because he didn't get a fMVP in any of them  People wonder why KD joined the Warriors. Fans and the media put so much emphasis on rings that these super-teams forming was inevitable. Players want to be remembered for being great, and people don't remember the Allen Iversons and the Charles Barkleys quite as well as the LeBrons and the MJs, and a large part of that is because they didn't win any championships."
Donovan Mitchell was one of the best players I‚Äôve ever seen during the 2020 series against the Nuggets so I actually agree with this. I have a ton of respect for Mitchell.
Donovan Mitchell and Eric Paschall on the same team as kids and Paschall was just traded to the Jazz.
"Good luck with Trae in the FIBA rules. Anyway jokes aside, the US will always have talents, but there is a possibility they won‚Äôt have the best player on the floor when they fade Greece, Serbia and Slovenia. That is the concern. Jordan to Kobe to lebron to KD to Donovan Mitchell?ü•≤"
"A Deserved victory of the United States against a great team of France.  The two best teams of the tournament were there. The gap between the USA and the best teams in the world is getting smaller and smaller.  The United States will have to send their best team in the future to avoid future big disappointments.  The French have already given the Americans a date in 2024.  The most incredible thing about Team USA is the incredible talent pool.  The Olympic champion team would probably have been beaten by a team composed of: LeBron, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Harden, Kyrie Irving, Donovan Mitchell, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Trae Young, Julius Randle."
"AD could be healthy (probably not) which would be huge.  Then a few of Zion, Trae, Donovan Mitchell, LaMelo, Anthony Edwards, Ja Morant, or De'Aaron Fox could be all-NBA level players by 2024 and that is probably all it would take."
Donovan Mitchell will be back
* PG - Stephen Curry * SG - Anthony Edwards * SF - Kevin Durant * PF - Jayson Tatum * C - Anthony Davis * Zach Lavine * Donovan Mitchell * Bam Adebayo * Zion Williamson * Cade Cunningham * Moses Moody * Trae Young
Steph/Trae/KD/Tatum/Mobley   Donovan Mitchell/Cade/Zion/AD/Booker/Ja Morant/CWood     Coach Ty Lue
This was far from the best team the USA could have fielded. The following are 2021 NBA All-Stars who weren't on the team.  Starters:  Bradley Beal  Kyrie Irving  Stephen Curry  LeBron James  Kawhi Leonard  Others:  Jaylen Brown  James Harden  Julius Randle  Mike Conley Jr.  Brandon Ingram  Donovan Mitchell  Chris Paul  Anthony Davis  Paul George  Zion Williamson
"Can't wait to see Team USA headed by Ja Morant, Donovan Mitchell, and Zion Williamson"
donovan mitchell is by far the best USA player coming up  hes going to win many golds against gobert
"2019 FIBA World Cup team was pretty weak:  Derrick White, Donovan Mitchell, Joe Harris, Marcus Smart, Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Mason Plumlee, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Kemba Walker"
Donovan Mitchell
"Height matters if the rest of your team is undersized . Donovan Mitchell plays on a team with 3 guys over 7 feet and 2 that can stretch . Along with oversized forwards.  Celtics D sucked because our backcourt needed Smart defense but with Kemba or Pritchard you has two guys who were under 6'3.  It don't work if your frontcourt is undersized too . We have Brown and Tatum , not Gobert.And those two shouldn't be adding duties on defense cause they our scorers.  Celtics had roster balance issue , why they got Kanter and Horford and Dunn and Richardson . Not really that big if improvement but we now have SIZE so now having undersized players is less of an issue."
"So, they will be blowing up for what, exactly? Utah won't attract top name FAs. Hell, if Dallas and Philly have issues, imagine Utah. So, they need to build within the draft and with smart S&amp;Ts. Let's say they blow it up, trade Mitchell and Gobert for a war chest. They could do great in the draft, maybe even trade an All-Star guard that shoots the hell out of everyone and a multiple times DPOY player.   They have their peak already, player wise. The max they can aspire if they blow it up it is to find a new Donovan Mitchell and a new Gobert. Much rather try to run it again one or two times before spinning the wheel, no?"
"Just to add in because i like to watch this guy: Donovan Mitchell was likened to D Wade a lot because of his low height but freakishly long arms and his playing style. It is season 5 for him and he already has two 50 point playoff games.   Now, if the Jazz, instead of lazily trying to pin all defense on Gobert, actually get better at perimeter defense..."
Not sure if serious but height doesn't matter in today's NBA positions. Where we have 6'7 guys playing center and 6'1 guys like Donovan Mitchell playing SG. I was shocked to learn that DM was 6'1. I thought he was at least 6'5 for some reason.
"Kyrie, Steph, Donovan Mitchell, Chris Paul, Lillard, Trae, Westbrook, Ja, etc dont have trouble getting to the rim."
I have always wondered that. I thought I was biased as a Jazz (specifically Donovan Mitchell) fan.
Used to work for a high end restaurant near Staples Center.  Donovan Mitchell came in right after winning the dunk contest and he was cool as hell with people who were coming up to him even though he was at dinner.  Served Bill Russell same weekend. He was slightly aloof but he‚Äôs also at an advanced age.  Also shook Dominique Wilkins hand and told him how much I used to enjoy watched him dunk even though I‚Äôm a Laker fan. He was so nice.
It's very rare the Jazz don't sniff the playoffs just have a hard time staying competitive when we get there. I agree Rudy fits the system better because we do play with a defense first mentality but often times good defense isn't enough. Mitchell is an outstanding player I don't really understand this narrative but to each his own. Also Books and Spidas stats are very close and comparable so I wouldn't consider him a downgrade Books has an edge on defense Spidas a bit higher % from behind the arc. Also less TOs.  https://franchisesports.co.uk/donovan-mitchell-vs-devin-booker-comparison-2021/
"I‚Äôve had Mitchell as the best player on the team since the Nuggets series in the bubble. He put on an all time performance, and Gobert got abused defensively because Jokic could shoot. I will admit that Rudy normally plays great in the regular season, but Donovan is consistently the better player when it matters, and that holds way more weight imo."
Giannis Middleton Jrue KD Harden Kyrie Trae Lebron AD Butler Tatum Steph Klay? Randle Beal Lillard Embiid Kawhi PG CP3 Booker Jokic Derozan? Luka Zion Jaylen Brown? Sabonis? Fox? Adebayo? Ayton? Donovan Mitchell John Collins? Jamal Murray? Zach Lavine? Lowry?   That‚Äôs 25 guys if you don‚Äôt include any of the question marks. 36 including question marks that I‚Äôm not sure are better but are close at this point in his career.
"It was insane watching Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell go against each other in the bubble. Throw in Gobert and Jokic, and Luka is still on the rise. This is heating up fast."
"No worries, [Conley made the same mistake when we first traded for him] (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.slcdunk.com/platform/amp/utah-jazz-social-media-take-note/2019/6/20/18692588/nba-trade-mike-conley-accidentally-says-city-of-utah-jazz-donovan-mitchell)"
"[Charania] The Utah Jazz have agreed to trade Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert and 4 first round draft picks to the Philadelphia 76ers for Ben Simmons, sources tell @TheAthletic @Stadium."
Donovan Mitchell is a really good version of Monta Ellis
"Rudy Gobert size 20, 258 lbs. .0775  Bonus: Donovan Mitchell, 215lbs, 17 shoe size. .079"
Donovan Mitchell averaged 32 ppg on 60% TS this playoffs while playing on a bad ankle.  Simmons isn't even in the same solar system as him anymore.
"Extremely biased but I love watching Donovan mitchell because it‚Äôs fun to watch a 6‚Äô1‚Äù dude leap and do acrobatic things someone of that height doesn‚Äôt usually do. And his playoff mode is becoming ungodly.  Dame Time and Jokic are also insanely fun to me, and call me crazy but I loved last years Floor General Harden"
It's still a felony offense and a sin that this man won ROY over Donovan Mitchell.
"""\[Stein\] Donovan Mitchell has been traded to the Houston Rockets, where he will serve a two-year Mormon mission."""
He is talking about only 20 % of his being assisted 3 pointers - your counter argument should‚Äôve been percentage of the assisted 3 pointers for  Donovan Mitchell not the number of attempts‚Ä¶ Donovan had 50% of his assisted and Luka had 23% assisted in regular season
Donovan Mitchell shot a much better 39% from three on 9.5 threes a game and I don't see anyone mentioning him as a top three point shooter  You don't get extra points for volume
People throw around superstar way way too lightly. I actually argued with people telling them Donovan Mitchell isn't a superstar and got massively downvoted lol. Now it takes getting to the 2nd round to make you a superstar I guess..
"Thought for sure this was Donovan Mitchell. Shoots 43%, 23 ppg."
"Yep. He's a strong on-ball downhill player. When he gets the ball he goes downhill like a bigger Donovan Mitchell. He can also pass out of there.  Problem is that NBA teams will be loathe to put him in that position. But if any team's primary playmakers can give up the ball, I guess it's Golden state."
"He gets to play with his longtime friend, Donovan Mitchell, which will be huge for his confidence and development. I'll miss EP7 but hes going to a good place."
he's best (good?) friends with donovan mitchell. i'd be excited to see them play together.
His $2M contract is like $12M in tax. Although they're probably trading him to free a roster spot while doing Paschall and the Jazz a favor (Donovan Mitchell and Paschall are childhood best friends).
The Jazz had two players injured that whole series. Mitchell and Conley were both not 100%. Even though Donovan was great on offense he was a revolving door on defense because he wasn‚Äôt able to move very well.
Yep!   [They gave each other their jerseys in their first matchup](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/warriors-eric-paschall-talks-nba-journey-alongside-donovan-mitchell).  They're from the same area of New York and were on the same AAU team together.
Give Donovan Mitchell HGH and pray he grows 6 inches
"Paschall grew up with Donovan Mitchell and they're good friends, so the Jazz probably wanted him to keep Spida happy and Warriors helped them and Paschall out"
trade donovan mitchell for gordon hayward
Paschall wanted to reunite with Donovan Mitchell?   who the fuck is eric paschall to be able to make that kind of request and have it granted
I mentioned this yesterday but:  **Tracy McGrady for Steve Francis and Cuttino Mobley**  I would say that would be the equivalent to if Kawhi was traded for Donovan Mitchell and Joe Ingles.
"I disagree. I think that Melo has a unique ability to create offense out of nothing and change the momentum of a game. Even if he‚Äôs not hugely efficient over long stretches, he makes timely shots and always demands defensive attention. It‚Äôs really a failure of analytics that stats don‚Äôt measure the full impact of high-volume, low-efficiency scorers like Melo, Lou Williams, Russ, and even younger guys like Donovan Mitchell and Anthony Edwards.  Also I guarantee Melo was not a net negative either for attendance or for the locker room."
"a) Giannis will always be exposed in the playoffs because ""no jumper!!"". The ""Donovan Mitchell &gt; Giannis for the playoffs"" takes I saw after like game 2/3 of the Nets series  b) All the ""Lakers are locks to win a title this year what's the point in other teams competing"" takes you saw in January  c) ""Kawhi wanting out of SAS is all just media driven fake news wanting to create narratives"". Same with pretty much every time there are reports of a star being unhappy and wanting out on here.  d) ""Danny Ainge needs to trade both BK picks for Boogie Cousins!!"" otherwise it shows how he's all talk.  e) Any overreaction to a hot small shooting sample size declaring its for real and that's what that guy will be now for good"
"Every all-in-one metric in the public domain ‚Äì¬†including EPM, Raptor, WS, and WS/48 ‚Äì¬†all of them say that Devonte' Graham is better than Lonzo Ball.  Except one. The one exception is Real Plus-Minus, which rates Lonzo Ball as the 10th-best player in the league last year ‚Äì¬†and Devonte' Graham as 15th-best.  However, RPM also rates Lonzo Ball above Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Luka Doncic, Zion Williamson, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, etc. So maybe take that one with a grain of salt."
"That guy did NOT look like a rookie, he was definitely the best player out there. Honestly he looked a lot like another player out there, his brother from another mother, Donovan Mitchell."
"on paper, having mitchell come off the bench and close out games with fox and haliburton seems sound. okc did it in 2020 with cp3, schroder, and shai, however donovan is miles of a coach better than walton so we‚Äôll see"
"I‚Äôd want to say Wiseman but that‚Äôs speculation. I‚Äôll go with Donovan Mitchell. His explosive scoring ability is gonna attract the media, has a nickname fans will like, and his playoff performances are gonna be memorable"
"I feel there are a lot of budding superstars that would definetely take center stage once the great ones retire.   Obviously Zion, Jason Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Trae Young are just a few names that come to mind."
Is this a reference to Donovan Mitchell to that one fan

"Are you looking at the average for the league...or by position..? It doesn't make sense to lump the power forwards and centers in there. Amongst guards he's actually better than guys like Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Drose, Westbrook, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young, Jayson Tatum and Westbrook"
The long lost brother of Donovan Mitchell.
"High volume guards with lower field goal percentages still get a ton of hate for being ""inefficient volume scorers"". I see guys like Donovan Mitchell get a lot of hate for it."
"Pick the Jazz. We have Joe Ingles and are generally an underdog franchise, so it feels great when we win. We‚Äôre also usually pretty good and have an extremely likable superstar in Donovan Mitchell."
Thinking that Donovan Mitchell and scrubs can‚Äôt beat LeBron AD and Russ is disrespectful AF. Didn‚Äôt you know?
"The Lakers are going to be the classic team that slacks off in the regular season, it's an old team and that's Lebron now, he looks great in November-January, then he's on autopilot until March, picks it up a bit in April, then it's playoff time and he's in the mode to be GOAT. I don't think they need to finish as a top 2 seed, I really don't see that. Btw, Westbrook too always looks bad at the beginning of the season now. If anything the Nuggets, Suns and Jazz are again going to race for the one seed, those teams all seem like that'd prove something to someone more than it would for the Lakers.   As for the Grizzlies, yeah Adams and Bledsoe are on the team but consider 1) Adams is the specialist center, meant to play D against Jokic and Embiid, Clarke and JJJ are probably going to end up switching as the 4 and 5 a lot of nights, and that seems like it could be pretty good, they're both willing defenders and 2) their backup PG spot is decently stacked, Brooks, Frazier and Allen are at least average, even if Bledsoe isn't.  Grizzlies are a consistent wing scorer away from being a 5 seed, those young guys are only going to get better and Morant, he's that dude. I think he'll look as good as Donovan Mitchell this season. To me they're a stealth candidate to get Buddy Hield."
"‚ÄúIf [Donovan] Mitchell is a Ferrari, then I‚Äôm a minivan‚Äù - is the rumored quote"
"Yeah old vets like Jamal Murray, divincenzo, deandre hunter, cam reddish, and Donovan Mitchell missing games really hurt those teams that rely on older players"
"In 2017 we Drafted Lauri ahead of Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, OG Anunoby, and Jarrett Allen  In 2018 They were too good for the high lottery odds and didn't want to trade up in the Luka, Trae, Ayton draft. We took Wendell Carter over Collin Sexton, Shai Gilgegous-Alexander, Michael Porter Jr. And then took Chandler Hutchinson with Shamet, Robert Williams, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, and Gary Trent Jr still on the board.  In 2019 we were again too good to get the high lottery odds and missed out on Zion and Ja Morant. We Drafted Coby White over Cam Johnson, Rui Hachimura, PJ Washington and Tyler Herro.   2020 draft is still up the air, but again we were too good for the highest odds and just missed Lamelo, Edwards, and Wisemen"
They're quite often starter or star level players at 13-15.  **13th pick over last 10 years:**  Donovan Mitchell  Devin Booker  Zach Levine  Kelly Olynik  Markief Morris  **14th pick over last 10 years:**  Michael Porter  Bam Adebayo  TJ Warren  Marcus Morris  **15th pick over last 10 years:**  Kawhi Leonard  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Kelly Oubre   And that's ignoring a bunch of guys who have had long careers off the bench.
"Jeremy Evans, Donovan Mitchell, and now Rudy Gobert for dunk contest champions"
"Leader of the team.... I‚Äôd say Donovan Mitchell is probably the best out of those guys , Tatum is younger and good but I just don‚Äôt see him carrying a team like Donovan Mitchell would ."
"As in the best player on Spain is clearly Rubio, not that their players are better than Team USA's players.   Like KD is clearly the best player on Team USA right now so I guess that's an exception, but if I asked you for the best player on Team USA for the 2019 FIBA world cup, honestly I don't know if you'd say Tatum, Middleton, Kemba, or hell Donovan Mitchell."
"At PG/SG he'd have to come in 3rd place a season against: Curry, Dame, Luka, CP3, Harden, Beal, Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Lavine, Kyrie, PG13, Westbrook etc. etc. (This is just who I named off top)  Probably not but anything is possible"
It's not mandatory. In Tatum's case he asked for it. Donovan Mitchell doesn't have any options
Hate to say this but I can see this happening to Donovan Mitchell if the Jazz have another tough playoff loss. Would almost be destiny
You mean the guy we traded for Donovan Mitchell?
"He was traded for Donovan Mitchell, so must be pretty good"
You probably would‚Äôve liked him less knowing he was traded with Tyler Lydon for Donovan Mitchell.
I demand Donovan Mitchell be fined for tampering üò° How dare he recruit his best friend!!!

What are they gonna give us in return?? Gobert and Donovan Mitchell seems fair to me
"One Donovan Mitchell, please"
For Donovan Mitchell of course
inc Donovan Mitchell
"It must really value offensive boards,  because Kanter has a higher rating than CJ McCollum, Donovan Mitchell, and Jayson Tatum, amongst others!"
"He does talk down to more 'average' people, not in an overly malicious kind of way but more in a ""Come on, are you serious?  No, we're not doing it this way"" kind of way - which can come off as dismissive and short tempered to the 'regular guys' (journalists, staff).  Wouldn't be surprised if, in private settings, he adds profanity to these type of comments.  Also, he can be quite controlling with the media and his image, too.  I really don't think he's all that bad, especially when you got other top brass in the league who have done worse (ex. Sarver), but I think he's just had it with Portland (if rumors are to be true).  And members of the franchise, from the front office to the players, have had it with his performance, with his antics being the icing on the cake.  After all, this is Dame's mouthpiece reporting this.  CJ's mouthpiece (his podcast-mate) has also been hostile towards Olshey for awhile now so it's not a surprise.  Dame has reason to be upset, I think, since he really wanted Donovan Mitchell back in 2017....but the GM did not take him.  Either way, I'm not so sure these 'antics' warrant being fired and I don't know that the current ownership would be able to adequately replace him (previous owner is dead, sister with casual basketball interest took over as owner).  People love Dame and Dame WILL have a say in finding a new GM but if I'm being honest, I don't think the combination of Dame and the current ownership will find an adequate replacement.  Also, Woj is Neil Olshey's mouthpiece so, we may get Woj bombs out of this, once the investigation is completed."
Bojan Bogdanovic averaged 23ppg on 48/41/91 shooting in the 15+ games that Donovan Mitchell missed through injury last season.       He gets less consistent shot attempts since our system has a lot of ball movement but he can absolutely step up and be an automatic bucket when needed.
"Utah won‚Äôt win shit though, they are a good regular season team but you are not gonna win a title with Donovan Mitchell or Rudy Gobert as your best player üòÇ."
Wonder what would have happened had Vlade not traded 10 to get 15 and 20 and just drafted Donovan Mitchell. Or with 15 and 20 they got OG Anunoby and John Collins.
75-50 after donovan mitchell launched a crazy half court shot was all clippers
I say Donovan Mitchell gets MVP and the Nets with kyrie win it all
Had to be reunited with his childhood buddy Donovan Mitchell.
"He's the third-best player on the team after Mitchell and Gobert, and he doesn't look to score as much as Donovan or JC. Third option."
"He says this after playing poorly in a big loss against the jazz without Donovan Mitchell. He is averaging 22/9/4 on 40/28/91 shooting and is blaming it on being ""bored""?"
"Without Donovan Mitchell, too. Their regular-season success and playoff disasters the last few years reminds me of the Bucks. In the next couple seasons, I'm betting they figure out how to translate the success to the post season like the Bucks did."
"Prime Deron Williams = 2021 Donovan Mitchell  Not in terms of play style, but impact. D Will was never really a top-10 player for a season, but he had stretched where he looked like one, he was pretty solidly in the top-20 though during his prime. Could be a #2 on a contender, or a #1 on a playoff team that might win one series."
Anyone know where to find Grateful Dead shirt Donovan Mitchell was wearing
"- The Jazz had just 9 points scored in the first 11 minutes of this game.    - The Jazz had just 30 points scored with 3 minutes until halftime.   - The Jazz scored 36 points alone in the third quarter and then 41 in the fourth!      What an insane mid-game turnaround, all without our best offensive player in Donovan Mitchell too!"
"Gotta be the best player on the team first. He‚Äôs actually been having the least efficient year of his career so far. The +\- stuff so far has mostly been some crazy shooting splits with the Mitchell/Whiteside group and the Conley/Gobert group. Jordan Clarkson being the leagues premier bricklayer insofar really hasn‚Äôt done any favors to the latter lineup. Also I swear opponents are shooting sub 15% from 3 whenever Whiteside‚Äôs on the floor, and Mitchell‚Äôs always on at the same time.   Rudy‚Äôs the MVP of this team unless Donovan starts permanently playing like his last playoff runs and hitting 47% from 3 on 10 attempts a game. The +/- stuff will probably flip back closer to what it was last year eventually."
"Jazz injury report:  Donovan Mitchell,  Royce O'Neale  Hassan Whiteside  Rudy Gay  Jared butler   :/ feelsbadman"
Donovan Mitchell hasn‚Äôt been playing good
Donovan Mitchell? Steph Curry?
Are you seriously saying Donovan Mitchell and Bojan Bogdanovic are average shooters? We literally broke the record for most 3s made per game last year. Plus Clarkson and O‚Äôneale are hardly poor shooters either.   The Jazz have a lot more offensive firepower than the warriors. This isn‚Äôt 2017 anymore. Golden State was a bottom 10 offense last year and it‚Äôs not like they made *that* many changes in the offseason. Utah has still been a top 5 offense this year despite shooting very poor from 3 to start.
"I watch like every sixers game, but I pretty much only watch sixers games, and I feel like I have a flawed view on a lot of players because of this haha. Like, based purely on what I've seen live against the Sixers, Demar and Blake Griffin and Derrick Rose are NBA 1st team but Donovan Mitchell and KAT ain't shit lol"
"&gt; Jamal when he was maxed was very inconsistent and was averaging 18/4/5 on 54 ts% with bad defense. That type of player is not worth a max. This is a fact proven by the existence of players of similar caliber none of which are getting paid the max. The conclusion is that he was given the contract based on his potential.  You mean a 20 year old was inconsistent? Shocking. A 20 year old averaging 18/4/5 with bursts of amazing play is exactly who gets the RFA max contract. I think you're thinking of supermax contracts which come after something like that.   Why? Because a team sees clear evidence in growth in the player as they've been in their system for years. They see a higher ceiling and as they mature and gain more experience (like every player in league history) they will become more consistent.   Otherwise they get the rookie extension which is for players like Grayson Allen, Larry Nance Jr., Kyle Kuzma, Luke Kennard, Markelle Fultz, etc. or the let Jamal Walk into RFA and feel disrespected or not believed in by the team, another team with the space gives him the max and then Denver matches it but with 1 less year on the contract.  &gt; The conclusion is that he was given the contract based on his potential.  Well...yeah. Of course. He had the same first 3 years as Devin Booker but just had less shots because Jokic was there. Same as Donovan Mitchell. All of these players are getting this contract based on their potential to grow and the teams belief that they will reach that potential. No player is an actualized or realized player at 21 or 22 years old.   When Jokic was averaging 18/11/6 did they sign him thinking that was going to be his peak? Of course not. When Mitchell was averaging 24/4/4 and shooting terribly from 3 and playing 0 defense did the Jazz sign him to the rookie max thinking that was the player they were going to get forever? No.  &gt; Reaching his potential or even improving at all was in no way a given.  A generic statement that can be applied to any player ever. Embiid being able to play 1/2 of a season when he got his extension wasn't a given. Trae Young finding a way to not be the worst defender at his position in the league and shoot better than 43 from the floor or 34 from 3 isn't a given--but he got his max. Fox turning out to not just be a stat accumilator on a terrible team when he was given his max isn't a given. KAT not being a black hole on offense and a terrible defensive player when he was given his max wasn't a given.   &gt; There were some things that were encouraging and would leave you to believe he's gonna improve, there were also huge red flags that would lead you to believe the opposite.  I don't know what red flags you're talking about. Year 1 to year 2 Jamal had a massive jump. Year 2 to year 3 Jamal's defense and playmaking took a huge steo up. Year 3 to year 4 Jamal took another step up in all areas and then obviously we saw the bubble. Then sure enough year 4 to year 5 was another giant step up.  There were no greater red flags with Jamal Murray than there are with any player at that age, and far more positives considering the nearly linear growth (and growth is never truly linear) compared to his peers.   &gt;  Waiting a year for him to hit RFA would've cost them nothing and alleviated a lot of the risk.  This isn't 2K. There is a human element to showing belief and trust in your player, especially for this Nuggets team and management, especially for all small market teams. You don't just get to let someone go to RFA and pretend like that doesn't stick with them, upset them, be in the back of their mind when they come up for free agency down the road. That's life. It has happened time and time again. If you think your player is worth matching a max in RFA then you max him on your own, otherwise you just bothered a cornerstone player of your franchise and also signed him to 1 less year than you could have.  &gt; Just because he turned out to be worth the max doesn't make maxing him a smart decision.   I guess it's a good thing that our front office of professionals designed to scout, draft, evaluate, train, and put players in positions to succeed before assessing the risk of 9-figure paydays knows better than you what is and isn't a 'smart decision'. It was a bad take then and I'm sure people let you hear it at that point just as they are now. It was a smart decision as a team, as a franchise, as a culture building organization, and as a small market team. No brainer.  &gt; This wasn't/isn't a reactionary take, all of you are just braindead.  Yes. It is everyone else who is wrong. Certainly not worth stepping back and reassessing your thoughts on a situation when everyone around you is telling you that you're wrong. It is the children who are out of touch!"
Did Donovan have 36ppg in a finals series? Twice.  No? Then not really relevant is it?  Mitchell also had it in this era. Not in 1999 when they were scoring 95 points a game.
Donovan Mitchell had 36 PPG that one series. I feel like you would agree that he is one of the best SGs all time right?
"The Clippers are not a good defensive team lmao. Donovan Mitchell cooked them and so did Booker until he broke his nose and had to wear that mask (it ruined his peripheral vision). Having Kawhi doesn't mean they're a good defensive team, he barely guarded Luka. Any good wing could have scored a bunch against them. Try to actually watch the games sometime."
"Davion Mitchell is playing awesome defense. Donovan had to work for every bucket he got when Davion was guarding him, and most of his scores came off plays designed to get a different defender switched onto him."
"I grew up with Donovan Mitchell, I wouldn‚Äôt say I switched teams, but at this point I know as much about the jazz as I do the Knicks"

some donovan mitchell shit
"Utah Jazz All-Stars tonight:  Donovan Mitchell: 36 pts, 5-12 3s, 8 rbd, 6 ast  Mike Conley: 30 pts, 6-9 3s, 3 rbd, 2 ast  Rudy Gobert: 12 pts, 20 rbd, 4 blk"
rudy fucking gobert  donovan fucking mitchell  mike fucking conley
Donovan Mitchell started his first five games shooting 25 from 2 and 17 from 3.   I hope Cade realizes his slow start isn‚Äôt something to beat himself up on because he seems like a chill dude
"Donovan with a couple ""not tonight"" to the other D. Mitchell."
"I think that's fair.   I tend to be very strict when it comes to these labels and that's mostly me being a choosy asshole more than anything else.  You can certainly make an argument for the rest of the top 10 players in the league and it'd be very difficult for me to argue against it. Luka, Dame, Jokic, and Embiid certainly are must watch players.  I feel pretty confident in saying that Tatum isn't a superstar yet though. He's comfortably in the same category as players like Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Jaylen Green, KAT, and Zach LaVine (I'm probably missing a few guys here). Each of these guys certainly have upwards projections."
"A lot of athletes are investors Harden is definitely it listed, Ja Morant, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, Kemba, Sabrina Ionescu, Skylar Diggins Smith, Taurasi under Athletes and Partners so I'm guessing they each got a piece of the company"
"Still, Donovan Mitchell has proven to be much more consistent in the playoffs than Tatum the last two postseasons.  Mitchell has played like a legitimate superstar for entire postseasons whereas Tatum just has a game or two a series like that.  I would take Tatum but it‚Äôs very close and there‚Äôs decent chance Mitchell really just has the mentality of an all-time great."
"Tatum would go no lower than 2 in a redraft and that‚Äôs only because Donovan Mitchell has proven to be a special scorer, but I think Tatum goes 1 unless his attitude/mental is a problem."
"Where do you think they get it from?  If you redraft 2016 and 2017, do Brown and Tatum get drafted any higher than they did in real life? Probably not.  Brown is 8th in BBRef Win Shares among the 2016 draft class, after Simmons, Sabonis, Siakam, Poeltl, Brogdon, Murray, and Zubac. A redraft today, he probably goes after Simmons and Murray ‚Äì third, just like he was originally.  Tatum is 3rd in Win Shares among the 2017 draft class, after Bam and Jarrett Allen. In a redraft, he'd probably go after Donovan Mitchell and Bam.   Both are solid players, but they've been treated like superstars-in-waiting by the NBA media for years."
"Yeah looking at the market it seems like a lot of teams _could_ try to offer their young dynamic stars, like the Jamal Murray or Donovan Mitchell, but I'm not sure why they'd do that and not just roll with their guys who are 5+ years younger.   My hot take is that Boston should 100% offer Brown for him though. They need to diversify the talent on their roster."
"Trading Chauncey Billups for Allen Iverson. Haven‚Äôt won a playoff game since..  Another terrible one was taking Luke Kennard over Donovan Mitchell, when Mitchell didn‚Äôt miss a single shot in his workout. Or taking Stanley Johnson over Devin Booker, a Pistons fan ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

"He kinda does, but he doesn't really fit in the Warriors playstyle at this point, and we're not really on a timeline to wait for him to develop.  He's a better fit for the Jazz, it looks like, but more to the point he and Donovan Mitchell are apparently very good friends and so dealing him for basically nothing to the Jazz was the best thing we could do for him when we weren't going to have roster space for him, while for the Jazz it's helpful for keeping your star happy as a small-market team if you can bring in their friends."
Dumb ass coach let Grayson Allen guard Donovan Mitchell üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Donovan Mitchell iced the game in two possessions
donovan mitchell is really good at basketball
I was promised a worse version of Donovan Mitchell.
"I mean they injured Lukas ankle then attacked it. They broke bookers nose. They injured Donovan Mitchell in the first game of the series. And when I watch the clippers what I would see is a team that is constantly pushing the line of fair play while simultaneously trying to do some weird hostile shit like hitting balls out of peoples hands during dead balls and shit. This goes back to the clippers v warriors series imo, where Bev dry jumped KD‚Äôs leg for a series and everyone praised their ‚Äúgrittiness‚Äù which of course had nothing to do with people just hating the warriors by that point. Since then their slogans have literally all centered around how ‚Äúgritty‚Äù and ‚Äútough‚Äù they are with their ‚Äústreet lights‚Äù brand of basketball.  Just seems funny to me to act like they are perpetually some victims that don‚Äôt get fair calls"
Haha indeed! But it‚Äôs tough to count on drafting a Donovan Mitchell in the late lottery
Donovan Mitchell is much better and is in a good situation to be built around. We also don't need Colin on Mitchell usage or leading the offense.
"Oh nice, so he is bigger than all star shooting guard Donovan Mitchell."
Even regular season Donovan Mitchell looks nothing like playoff Mitchell. Dude just keeps turning it up as the games get harder
I know Donovan Mitchell came out looking nothing like he did in college.

It‚Äôs always gonna be defense for him. I want to see him defend the top players in the playoffs. He got torched by cp3 and booker last year and by Donovan mitchell and lebron theyear before.   That being said I think him and curry are clearly the top 2 offensive players in the league.
"[https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced/?sort=OFF\_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PORound=1](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced/?sort=OFF_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PORound=1)  The reason that rating is so high is because the Blazers played 1 round. If we look at first round ratings, the KD led Nets had a far higher ORTG than the Blazers. The Nets had 128 ORTG to the Blazers 122.1 ORTG.  The Jazz with an offense led by Donovan Mitchell had a 123.4 ORTG to the Blazers 122.1 ORTG.  The very team Dame's Blazers faced, the heavily injured and handicapped Nuggets, with an offense spearheaded by Jokic, had an ORTG of 122.9 to the Blazers 122.1.  If you go to the 2nd round, the Suns tie the Blazers ORTG and the Clippers demolish it, nearly having an ORTG as high as the Nets.  The 122.1 being the highest in NBA history is a result of small sample sizes and offense being more and more efficient each year. Saying ""Full Run"" is misleading because again, it was only 1 round and it punishes teams like the Nets and Nuggets and Jazz for getting our of the first round. Next playoffs, there will probably be an elite offensive team that's eliminated in the first round that puts up the NEW ""Highest ORTG in any playoff run ever."""
"Caruso 'got cooked today by Donovan'??? Mitchell had 30 points on an awful 9/27 shooting and he also had 6 turnovers. Buddy, that ain't cookin."
Tbh I think Mitchell was cooking AC all first half but they were definitely avoiding having Lonzo being the on ball defender on Donovan
"Idk how much other people noticed but the Jazz were trying so hard to avoid the Donovan vs Lonzo matchup. Every single time Lonzo was man to man with Mitchell 100% the set a screen. On the other hand, Donovan was cooking up Caruso whenever AC was the on hall defender. Lonzos so good bruh"
Need more Donovan Mitchell vs Zach LaVine
"I'm not denying his greatness. But as you just demonstrated people associate too much of the success with him and not enough with thibodeau (in both cases), Gibson and Noah. The team was a defensive juggernaut and is why they were so good.  Perhaps a better example would be Donovan Mitchell. Is in his 4th year averaged 26ppg, his team was the 1st seed in the league winning 72% of his games. In the postseason the previous year he averaged 36 and this year he averaged 32 en route to the conference finals.  For comparisons sake the stats they averaged were  26.4/4.4/5.2/1/0.3 on 56.9% TS for Mitchell -0.3% TS  And 25/4.1/7.7/1/0.6 on 55% TS for Rose +0.9% TS  Now fairly comparable seasons (Rose was of course better and younger). Rose has the impact metrics of a superstar one of the 10 best in the game Mitchell does not. Now most would say Mitchell is better than Gobert. Despite Gobert fairly easily eclipsing Mitchell on the impact stats front.  Again I'm not knocking rose but it is a fallacy people fall into. Teams dominate with defence but people assume that the offence is the reason tbey are winning. For example Bills Boston with Cousy, Havlicek, Jones and their like 12 other HoF players. They won because Bill dominated defensively. Further examples are the Olajuwon rockets they were very average offensively in fact bottom half that postseason in efficiency (9th) but they were 2nd in defensive efficiency and won. Really the only team that I can think this fallacy hasn't applied to is detroit in 04. Mainly because they didn't have a clear cut offensive stud. And their games were so low scoring it was obvious it was defence. Hell someone like draymond is rated as worse than Klay because Klay scores 20 a night.  I'd also say it was fairly weak competition for MVP that season. The scoring leader was KD with 27.7. LeBron averaged 26.5/7.7/7 on a stacked what team that won fewer games (by 4), Kobe averaged 25/5/5 on again a Lakers team that won fewer games (by 5). The 61 win spurs team didn't have anyone averaging over 17.5 and also dominated through defence. I think Rose probably deserved the MVP but can you say it was a top 30 season in nba history can you say it was a top 50 season in nba history? Can you say there aren't 50 players with better seasons in nba history?  I think you would say no to all those things. It gets overrated as a season because it was an MVP season and because people underrate defence."
Harden does swing from underneath. But the defender hits his forearms. If a player is going for a shot and you swipe fore arm that‚Äôs a foul every time.    If he actually touched the ball at all then you‚Äôd have a point.  Donovan Mitchell is another player who uses these scoop shots. You can‚Äôt just wrestle with them while they‚Äôre taking it lol
Ja. Zion seems to be missing some sort of attitude that can cary a team. From the beginning Ja has been a dog with a do what he can to help the team win no matter what attitude. I think intangibles matter a lot when looking for a franchise player. Like Ben Simmons was probably better than Donovan Mitchell but look what each has done for their franchise. Not comparing Zion to Simmons but Ja feels more like a must have franchise star.
"Yeah, cause Paul George isn‚Äôt an all star caliber player. Or Batum isn‚Äôt extremely talented. Just come out and admit you don‚Äôt like the Jazz. Donovan Mitchell was clearly injured and wasn‚Äôt able to drive. He also generally struggles to defend and those problems were greatly exacerbated by his injury. But okay, I guess the Clipps are JUST Kawhi. What a dumbass take."
"Yes and like the rest of r/nba you fail to take into account that we were also playing a hobbled Donovan Mitchell. Just like no one mentions we missed Mike Conley in a few big games or Bojan Bogdonovic in the Denver series.  It‚Äôs pretty weird that somehow it‚Äôs an easy excuse for these teams if they lose to Utah because their star is injured, but if Utah is missing their stars it‚Äôs somehow not relevant at all?"
Donovan Mitchell knows this pain all too well.

This is one of the craziest things that people say as if millionaires can't get really good food anywhere on Earth. Acting like Steph Curry only has good cardio because dudes in San Francisco don't know hot to season the shrimp right or some shit. All we gotta do to destroy the Utah Jazz is send one of these gumbo recipes to the chefs and Donovan Mitchell will get so addicted that he'll gain 80 lbs!
"Now that Donovan Mitchell has turned 25, I can proclaim that Ja is in the top 5 under 25 officially now"
OP is referring to Donovan Mitchell who had an unfortunate 8 second violation in his 57 point playoff game.
without Mike Conley and a hurt Donovan Mitchell.
1. Donovan Mitchell  2. Trae Young 3. Draymond 4.trae young 5. Giannis 6. Steph 7. Kyrie
"Yes, I would like either Devin Booker or Donovan Mitchell."
Us Jazz fans thought so too. Thank God for Donovan Mitchell
As a Jazz and Donovan Mitchell fan it has been weird seeing everything turn this way for Simmons. I remember how often you would hear people say they would take Simmons over Mitchell and now nobody seems to like him. I feel sort of bad for him (assuming he has learned something from this)
"You know what I mean. Draymond‚Äôs value was really overstated in peak years. He WAS seen as an do it all star and warriors second best player. Like I said he was a 90 overall at one point. I‚Äôm not saying he was seen as the best player in the league, but he was seen as this transcendent star because of his unique skills. My argument here is his versatility is so good that yes he has become overrated,  because he can defend all 5 positions, has good court vision, and can stretch the floor (a bit), people assumed he was great at each of those qualities. His assists numbers are bloated because of Steph and Klay, and without Steph and Klay his offensive game is really lackluster. Is that to say that Draymond has no value? No. Look at Rudy Gobert like you said teams change their whole game plan playing against Utah. But you never hear ‚ÄúRudy Gobert is the reason Utah is great, not Donovan Mitchell. He‚Äôs the heart and soul of Utah.‚Äù And let‚Äôs face it a lot of times people say things like that about Draymond because they think that makes them a basketball genius. Lol.   So what is Dray really? He‚Äôs a guy who has amazing court vision for his position, but assist numbers are a bit bloated. He‚Äôs a guy whose defense is not underrated at all, but fantastic. And a guy whose offensive game is really lacking, but has his moments. He‚Äôs basically a great role player anyone wants. But let‚Äôs not act like Steph and Klay and the system didn‚Äôt make him into a star!"
"Ant is the perfect guard with Simmons and KAT, thats like saying Donovan Mitchell wouldnt fit on the Wolves if it had Ben and KAT"
"You mean, future celtic donovan mitchell?"
"But Donovan Mitchell lost to the same clippers team that Devin booker beat? lol. Also, Mitchell‚Äôs defense was a huge reason why they ALSO blew that 2-0 lead. Dude couldn‚Äôt guard a guy standing in the corner. It was actually sad. He scored buckets but man was he getting toyed with on the other end."
Donovan Mitchell true ROY
"That somehow  Pippen's 1994 season is a hall of fame level achievement or solidifies him as a top 20-30 player.   He averaged 22/8/6 on 48/32/66 shooting.  So wasn't exactly lighting up the stat sheet.  He led the Bulls to the second round of the playoffs. Something 8 teams do every year. Other #1 options that have led their team as far as Scottie include Donovan Mitchell, Demar DeRozan, John Wall, Joe Johnson, etc.  He was a distant 3rd in MVP voting with around 15% of votes behind David Robinson averging 30/11/5/3 and Hakeem with 27/13/4/4 on the two top teams. Other players who have come third for MVP or better include Paul George, Jermaine O'Neal, Blake Griffin,  Grant Hill, and Penny Hardway.  Basically everything adds up to Scottie being about as good as your Paul George/Jimmy Butler type of player. Which is still really really good. Yet people act like his 1994 season was one of the best individual seasons ever. As if Robinson and Hakeem were not absolutely the best players in the league those non-MJ years."
We have the data: Donovan Mitchell edged out Devin Booker. Now you don't have to apologize for listing Don as 1% better than Booker.
Donovan Mitchell agrees. But jokes aside I don't think there should be an asterisk next to Blake and Ben's ROY awards. Your first season played you're a rookie.
"My guesses were:  * KD * Giannis (I thought maybe against the Pistons or something) * Anthony Davis * Donovan Mitchell * John Wall * Devin Booker * Andre Iguodala  I was certain of #5 and #6 and I guessed #7 was going to be either from the Warriors or Cavaliers, because he was never going to be one of the stars and for a role player, bad FT shooter to shoot at least 20 free throws he would need a lot of games."
"/u/Pierre-Delectos-Sock's preference was for Donovan Mitchell to win Rookie of the Year, sources say"
"It's harder than I thought, I have 28 names right now.  (IN NO ORDER)  Lebron James  James Harden  Kevin Durant  Giannis  Damian Lillard  Steph Curry  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Trae Young  Donovan Mitchell  Khris Middleton  Jrue Holliday  Jamal Murray  Klay Thompson  Anthony Davis  Russell Westbrook  Kawhi Leonard  Paul George  Jayson Tatum  Kyle Lowry  Pascal Siakam  Jimmy Butler  Zach Lavine  Luka Doncic  Ja Morant  Kyrie Irving  Bradley Beal"
Donovan Mitchell too
Lonzo over Donovan Mitchell. What are we doing.
I just saw the 2k22 trailer and they had MJ in a shot next to Donovan Mitchell so I already know what you‚Äôre talking about lmao. Simmons outta the ‚ÄúNext LeBron‚Äù comps is easily the closest on paper. I got the appeal of picking him 1st at the time and after his rookie year
"Don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve seen Donovan Mitchell play, but he‚Äôs a bad, bad man. Jazz at 5 is absolutely absurd. RemindMe! 223 days I‚Äôll shoot you a message."
"Oh‚Ä¶. So injuries only matters if it happens to Lakers stars and not the Suns 2nd team all nba player, got it! Only the games where AD wasn‚Äôt injured but CP3 was count, good to know! CP3 averaged 9/4/8 on 44% TS that series btw.   Porter hurting his back is such a cop out, no shit the guy who fell late in the draft because of his back problems is going to be playing through back problems. It‚Äôs not exactly like him being more stiff cut down on his creating, playmaking, or defense‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs nothing to cut down on. He was a non factor with Mikal‚Äôs length, he had problems even in game 1 before the reports of any kind of back injury. Him being healthy is clearly not the difference between winning a series or losing is in 4 significant losses, 2 of which were over by the end of the 3rd quarter.   Again, isn‚Äôt it wild how absolutely has an injury they played through that gives them an out from their fans, but Booker playing through a broken nose just didn‚Äôt happen. Not like there was a drastic drop in efficiency from before to after‚Ä¶ and yet the Suns still made the finals. Crazy.   Cool. DBook had 30 in 3 quarters and then 47 on 90% TS in back to back games to close out the Lakers, wasn‚Äôt needed in the Nuggets series, and stepped up massive in the first 2 games when we needed him most, without cp3. He then broke his nose and regressed, but was enough to keep us afloat‚Ä¶ including back to back 40 point games in the finals. Back to back 40 point games in the finals, even in losses, would be at the top of Donovan Mitchell‚Äôs achievements.   Mitchell had great games, but he also was a heavy contributor to how god awful the Jazz‚Äôs perimeter defense is. Book stepping up on defense was the reason our defense went from 8th to 4th in the playoffs (2nd until the finals). Mitchell put up massive scoring numbers, but he also did it against the Grizzlies (worse than any team we played injuries accounted for), and then shot well but lost to the Clippers. If scoring 40 in losses matter, then I think the back to back 40s in the finals matter a lot."
Donovan Mitchell
Donovan Mitchell would instantly be the face of New York sports. Dude is a Mets fan and loves this city and is an unbelievably good player that would fit perfectly with this team
Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker. They're both silky smooth and fun to watch.  And no order on their names; I just alternate between them when I answer questions.
Last year in Mitchell‚Äôs 4th season he averaged 26.7 ppg on 57% TS and Devin Booker averaged 25.6 ppg on 59% TS in his 6th season. This is with Devin Booker having Chris Paul on his team and Donovan Mitchell‚Äôs 2nd best scoring threat probably being Jordan Clarkson. I‚Äôm not like saying TS is the end all be all of efficiency or anything because my main argument is what Mitchell has accomplished as the sole number 1 option compared to what Booker has done before CP3
1. James Harden  2. Klay Thompson  3. Donovan Mitchell  4. Devin Booker  5. Zach LaVine  6. Bradley Beal  7. Jaylen Brown  8. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  9. Colin Sexton  10. CJ McCollum

The years we had 2 superstars and kept getting embarrassed in the playoffs by guys like rookie Donovan Mitchell in the 1st round
"Became a Knicks fan around 2011, but been diehard since 2013.   Where do I begin?   Alexey Shved or Langston Galloway being legitimately the best player on the floor at times in 2014/15?  Losing our pick in 2016 to the nuggets, who drafted Jamal Murray?  Jarrett Jack and Ramon Sessions getting reps at PG in 2018?  Getting backstabbed by KP in 2019, followed by falling to the third overall pick in the 2019 draft?  Drafting Kevin Knox instead of MPJ, and Frank Ntilikina ahead of Donovan Mitchell?  It's been a dark eight years. Let us have this moment with a competent FO and team."
"yeah you can see it with a few, Donovan Mitchell for example hes great at driving, but Gobert is so bad the spacing in the interior sucks. most of these good players are ""bad"" in the paint is because the spacing like you said sucks so much the extra defender just sags off to them"
"Donovan Mitchell was going to play baseball until he got injured and switched the basketball when he was ~16, pretty sure he's pitched with the mets."
The lack of Donovan Mitchell is criminal!
Donovan Mitchell but I just wish the jazz improved a bit to contender level
If Donovan Mitchell isn‚Äôt in your top 5 it‚Äôs wrong btw
Donovan Mitchell will win MVP one day.
"If I remember, steph's scouting report was pretty accurate. Everybody knew what kind of shooter and scorer he was coming out of college. I think the question marks surrounding how his game would translate were valid. Obviously he's answered all those questions but I don't think anybody could've predicted he would become one of the greatest point guards of all time.  My pick is deaaron fox. Unbelievable athlete. Will be one of, if not the fastest players in the league. Gifted passer. Tight handles. Elite finisher at the rim. Needs to improve on his 3 point and free throw shooting. I think all those things have held true so far.  The opposite would be donovan mitchell. Coming out of louisville he was seen as a defense first player who was improving on offense but was pretty inefficient and would need some time on that end. He would have to play off ball most of the time and him initiating the offense would be out of the question, especially early in his career. It's kind of crazy how it's the complete opposite now."
"Ben is the more talented and impactful player at both ends, and he'd instantly make us the best defense in the league. I just think the talent gap is big enough that it overrides any fit issues. We'd trade Kevon Looney for Donovan Mitchell in an instant no matter how lopsided it makes our team because our ceiling with Mitchell is insanely high. And if it didn't work, Draymond yelling at Simmons for not taking layups would be really funny."
The problem with relying solely on Gobert protecting the rim is once he‚Äôs on the perimeter he‚Äôs practically no different than Donovan Mitchell. If he hugged Mann the rim would‚Äôve been wide open all game long because the other Jazz players couldn‚Äôt stop them from getting in. It would‚Äôve been a layup line for the Clippers. Gobert was in a lose-lose situation and did the best he could.
It's all a crap shoot anyway. In 2017 the #29 ranked guy was Nick Weatherspoon. In 2015 #29 was Donovan Mitchell.
"Davion Mitchell, Tyler Herro, Donovan Mitchell"
"they were a game out of the one seed because someone injured Donovan Mitchell, every good thing the suns did was because of injuries to other teams and the one time they faced a team not so injured they lost"
"Lamelo Ball, Joel Embiid, and Donovan Mitchell. Also like watching Zion play, but idk that I‚Äôd call him one of my favs"
"Watching all the reddit stat nerds crap on Mitchell to prop up Gobert all season was honestly the most frustrating shit ever. Once playoffs rolled around and Spida started routinely dropping 30 bombs on a bum ankle and Rudy got cooked by Terance Mann(lmfao) and Reggie Jackson in game 6 they all shut the hell up for a day or two which was nice.  Donovan Mitchell is the best player on the Utah Jazz, end of story."
"Giannis, Embiid, Donovan Mitchell"
Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are a bit better than Josh Okogie and Jarrett Culver I think
"Oh man, Donovan Mitchell. Who DOESNT love this guy?"
Currently Donovan Mitchell or Giannis . All time - Larry Johnson or Gary Payton
This was the first year KAT had playoff caliber help so yes  Give KAT Donovan Mitchell and he makes the playoffs too lol
Not current but I just wanted to do this one:  1. ANT 2. Donovan Mitchell  3. D-wade
Jazz fans out here talking about how Gobert is better than Donovan Mitchell when Gobert couldn't post up Luke Kennard lmao
Donovan Mitchell has very similar overall impact metrics
Donovan Mitchell - DWade - MJ
Donovan Mitchell has better playoff numbers than most superstars
Jamal Murray v Donovan Mitchell
"Assuming they sign the deal today for the next 5 years:  **100% worth it**:  * Lebron (idc how old he is he's still the best player when he plays)  * Jokic  * Giannis (I honestly am not as big on Giannis as most but I would be raked over the coals if I left him off)  * Luka  * Harden  * KD  * Tatum (people might disagree but he's a durable two-way player with a very high floor, so even if he doesn't develop anymore I think it's worth it or almost worth it)  These are guys who are not big injury risks and can be the best player on a championship team.  KD is the biggest injury risk but he is good enough and just durable enough to definitely be worth it.  And none of them are big defensive liabilities.  **99% worth it**:  * Kawhi  * Curry  Great players that can lead their team but may have age/injury risks tied to them.    **I basically think that all of the players below this are unlikely to win a championship if they are on a supermax.**  **Worth it but it's a risk**:  * Embiid (he's the second best big in the league but is a pretty big injury risk)  * Zion  * Jimmy Butler (he's a great all-around player and a winner, but he's not quite as good as everyone above him on this list)  * Paul George (before this postseason run he probably wouldn't have been in this tier)  * Donovan Mitchell (he's a good player, I think the risk is that he never quite reaches superstar potential, but it would likely be a slight overpay rather than a complete waste)  * KAT (young player who's a beast on offense, bad defensively, no success whatsoever)  * Trae Young (he's small and a terrible defender so he will need to become a player almost as good as Curry to be worth it)  * Ja Morant  **Not worth it, but would get it**:  * Lillard (bad defensively, no playoff success)  * Anthony Day-to-Davis (can't stay healthy, has proven he cannot be THE guy)  * Bradley Beal (i don't think this would handicap a team, but i don't think he's quite a superstar)  * Russell Westbrook (no idea if he would get it at this point in his career, but i bet some team would give it to him)  I don't think Devin Booker would get it, but he would probably fall into this list.  Although he's another guy that prob wouldn't handicap a team on a supermax, he just probably wouldn't ever fully live up to it.  And I don't think CP3 would get it today at his age.  ***Might* be worth it, but prob wouldn't get it**:  * Anthony Edwards  * LaMelo Ball  * SGA  * Jamal Murray  * De'Aaron Fox  Did I miss anyone?"
Ben Simmons is better than Donovan Mitchell.
"Barrett is an all star, Knicks trade for Zion Williamson and Donovan Mitchell"
Is Donovan Mitchell even a top 20 player lol
Ah so should the Jazz and Celtics have traded Donovan Mitchell and Jayson Tatum after their all rookie season?
"Which is a system that works if you have say, Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley with rotating in Jordan Clarkson and Joe Ingles in the mix, but not with Bledsoe and Lonzo"
Donovan Mitchell
Donovan Mitchell probably
Nobody in their right mind should take PG over Mitchell. There are two head to head series that demonstrate that. Of course I'd take Kyrie for the basketball talent but he is one annoying and unpredictable dude. Donovan is *literally* one of the best big game performers in playoff history thus far (obviously smaller sample size). You know what you're gonna get. PG is an enigma and Kyrie might be on vacation the entire regular season.
no because donovan mitchell has 4x the amount of votes than the next person
donovan mitchell
Agreed. Mitchell running away with this poll right now. I like the Jazz as a team but there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm taking Donovan Mitchell over Kyrie or PG.
Right? Anyone taking Donovan Mitchell over Zion is out of their mind.
"Still very young in his career but I‚Äôve seen a few others mentioned with about his same experience, so Donovan Mitchell. He‚Äôs progressively gotten better but he‚Äôs consistently been the first option for the Jazz ever since the end of his first season."
Donovan Mitchell will win an MVP. Kat will demand a trade and become unlocked Pink Diamond Kat wherever he goes.
Off the top of my head these are guards that I can confidently say are more athletic/explosive at this point...  Zach Lavine  Donovan mitchell  Ja morant.     Am I missing more? I don‚Äôt think there are that many.
I feel like Donovan Mitchell has cried a few times these past years
"DeMar DeRozan, Karl Anthony Towns, CJ McCollum, Donovan Mitchell"
"&gt; You seem to have lost track of the discussion in that case, your initial comments towards me were directly about Jokic and Harden's defensive comparison.  Not really, I responded to you discussing all areas of their games and how they stack up in all categories..you only seemed to hyper focus on the defense portion though..so thats all you. You take shots at Jokic, but Harden was on the most stacked team in the league and lost..thats way more telling than Jokic trying to carry his team single handedly against a much better Suns team.   And as I have pointed out many times, Jokic's impact overall and efficiency was way higher than Harden's this year, so if you strictly want to view this as through the lens of on the court play this year...the debate of who is better between the two is already over, its Jokic.  &gt;his PnR defense is the same reason why guards like Dame, CJ, Booker, CP3, and Donovan have career series against the Nuggets.  Thats cute, it surely is a factor but I've never heard of someone trying to pin the blame for the strong performances of opposing guards on the other team's center instead of say...the guard defenders lol most of those players go off via 3 point shooting, not driving on pick and rolls.   I'll even give you a counter example, who is the best big defender in the league, Gobert right? Well if you look at how Paul George played in each series this year, would you guess which team he scored the most against? You guessed it, the Jazz. He did pretty damn well against Ayton too. Its a weak argument you're trying to spin, doesn't hold up.  Mitchell scored nearly 40% of his points from 3 that series, McCollum had a below average FG% on 2 point shots that playoff run and shot the same % of 3 point attempts he always does, Booker had his lowest scoring series against the Nuggets compared to any of the other 3 series, and Dame scored over 50% of his points from 3....so honestly it seems like you're just throwing shit at the wall and actually have no idea what you're talking about.   If you think Jokic is a bad defensive center because he can't defend the pick and roll, can't switch and can't play above the rim, then surely you can't say Gasol at that point in his career was a good defender.  We are talking about centers here, not power forwards, the Warriors had a rotation of role players at center.  Same with the Heat, they had guys like Eddy Curry playing center for them that year. On that Mavs team, Chandler is solid overall but he didn't play well defensively that playoff run, no one on that team averaged more than 1 block per game  There is no trend, there is no correlation...generally speaking, better teams overall end up being better defensive teams, but again, you're just trying to throw shit against the wall."
"&gt; I love how you just ignored all the advanced stats and direct comparative stats, and just keep staying laser focused on just Jokic's defense. You say this:  You seem to have lost track of the discussion in that case, your initial comments towards me were directly about Jokic and Harden's defensive comparison.   Whatever edge Jokic (apparently) has in offense isn't enough to surmount his lackluster defense at the most important defensive position.   [He gave up 67.7 FG% at the rim last year's regular season.](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/opponent-shooting/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;DistanceRange=By%20Zone&amp;sort=Restricted%20Area%20FG%20PCT&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=Restricted%20Area%20FGA*GE*10&amp;PlayerPosition=C)  [In the playoffs that number increased to 70.3%](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/opponent-shooting/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;DistanceRange=By%20Zone&amp;sort=Restricted%20Area%20FG%20PCT&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=Restricted%20Area%20FGA*GE*10&amp;PlayerPosition=C)  And that's only one facet, his PnR defense is the same reason why every other guard they meet in the playoffs has a career series: Dame, CJ, Booker, CP3, Donovan Mitchell, etc.  &gt;But then when I give you tons of advanced stats that suggest, actually, Jokic's impact overall, primarily offense though, was way higher than Harden's, you just ignore it.  **""No guard can do what a big does on defense, which is be the defensive anchor for the team and offer rim protection. The same isn't true on the offensive end, Jokic is one of the best passing bigs OAT, but he isn't the first/only for a reason.""**   Your advanced stats saying Jokic is a better offensive player than Harden don't refute this.  &gt;The Raptors, pretty much all the Warriors teams, the Cavs, the first Heat big 3 title, the Mavs...there is no clear correlation at all honestly.  Marc Gasol is not a below average defensive big.   Draymond Green is not a below average defensive big.  Chris Bosh is not a below average defensive big.   Tyson Chandler is not a below average defensive big.  The only outlier is the 2016 Cavs, which are an outlier amongst champion teams for an obvious reason."
No one expects PG to beat LeBron but he has to beat Dame and Donovan Mitchell. I guess he gets a pass for losing to DeRozan and Lowry and Jokic though.
Donovan Mitchell should have been on this list before Young or Booker.
Donovan Mitchell
"Assuming no injuries and maintaining current trajectories, our next line up might look like:  -Trae Young/LaMelo/Fox -Donovan Mitchell/SGA/Zach LaVine -Jayson Tatum/Michael Porter/Brandon Ingram/Jaylen Brown -Anthony Davis/Zion Williamson -Bam/Jarret Allen/Christian wood  That's not a dream team but it's still all star loaded, and on paper with preparation should be a 5-10 pt favorite over every other matchup if not more."
"PG bragged to reporters? What, you mean the time when he was asked about *guarding* Donovan Mitchell, said he'll guard him especially in late game, then joked about Playoff P? And when asked about Playoff P, explained that it's just him locking in?"
"Donovan Mitchell TS%: 56.7%, 28.8 PPG, 33 games"
"It was a terrible pick is the point. Just because someone is taken high does not make them a good player.  Also, while Jokic was an amazing pick. Drafting Mudiay and trading Donovan Mitchell are very bad moves for any GM."
RemindMe! 5 years  My 2025 top 20 list:  1. Luka Doncic  2. Jayson Tatum  3. Trae Young  4. Giannis Antetokounmpo  5. Nikola Jokic  6. Donovan Mitchell  7. Ja Morant  8. De'Aaron Fox  9. LaMelo Ball  10. Cade Cunningham   11. Devin Booker  12. Bam Adebayo  13. Zion Williamson  14. Michael Porter Jr.  15. Jalen Suggs  16. Jalen Green  17. Darius Garland  18.

"I think they have a shot if Lebron, AD, KD, harden, Kyrie, Steph, dame, luka, Giannis, Trae young, Middleton, jimmy butler, jokic, Rudy gobert, Donovan Mitchell, Tatum, Julius randle, Devin booker, Chris Paul, Paul George, embiid and ja Morant suffer season ending injuries"
"Yeah screw ESPN and all New York and Cali teams.  The league is so much more then those teams and the talent on all of the ""small market"" teams is ridiculous.  Let's focus on players like Jokic, Giannis, Luka, Trae, Ja, Donovan Mitchell and all the other guys trying to build something special."
"Not ADs fault new Orleans couldn't build a team properly around him. AD was the only reason new Orleans was competing. With that logic Donovan Mitchell, trae young, and Devin booker are better than Luka just bc they have made it further and had more success. ( I'm not saying AD is better than kawhi, Giannis and Harden btw)"
"While Donovan Mitchell is not better at what he does than Rudy Gobert is, Donovan Mitchell, in today‚Äôs NBA, is a more valuable player."
Kareem  Lebron  Jokic  Pedo  Giannis  Idk the first emoji but the 2nd KD  Donovan Mitchell  ??  Tingus Pingus  Kemp  Nurkic
"MJ, Lebron, Jokic, Karl Malone, dunno, Kobe, Donovan Mitchell, dunno x4  Edit- I missed reign man, I‚Äôm a shitty Sonics fan üíÄ"
"First team all likable:  Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Klay Thompson, Giannis, Nikola Jokic"
"That's fair. After all, in the latest postseason, Ben Simmons and Donovan Mitchell both averaged in the 30s in key stats."
Oh this portland thing isnt lasting beyond next year only so much more false hope they can pretend to sell Dame on.  Donovan Mitchell gonna get tired of Rudy Gobert again at some point
By this logic Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell are superstars and Luka is not. Which is why this logic is completely garbage. He is clearly already a superstar.
I remember people saying that about Westbrook against a rookie Donovan Mitchell. also against an injured Portland team
"It‚Äôs funny, because my buddy has been telling me Donovan Mitchell is big time since the day he was drafted. I never saw it until maybe 2 years ago during the bubble, but my man had the vision."

Honestly anyone who got overhyped in the bubble. Like Donovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray are not the future of the NBA bro
but probably not for what the rockets wanted. i mean would you trade donovan mitchell or someone like that for simmons??
"The amount of hype he got going into college and the draft was like LeBron level. It‚Äôs not weird that he didn‚Äôt live up to that, few players do. I think what feeds into the Simmons hate is the fact that other guys were taken after him (both in that draft and in subsequent drafts) who have added to their games offensively and become 20+ ppg scorers while Simmons has appeared relatively stagnant to casual watchers. Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Jamal Murray, De‚ÄôAaron Fox, Trae Young, Ja Morant, the list goes on. Would I rather have any of those guys? Maybe some of them. It‚Äôs probably too early to tell, but if Simmons gets traded away, the Sixers will be quantitatively worse in a lot of ways and people will see his true value."
"Utah Jazz for sure. We have the league's most sympathetic and likable player, Joe Ingles. Really funny guy, you just can't hate on him. We have Donovan Mitchell, best player of his class (2017). He would have got Rookie Of The Year award but he got robbed by Ben Simmons. I don't wanna get into that, complex situation. Anyways we have Rudy Gobert, good ol French guy, best defencer in the league. He got 2 back to back Defensive Player Of The Year. And we have a really good chance to be champion this year."
Height is the most important followed by wingspan and then standing reach although in some cases wingspan can be better than height like Donovan Mitchell guy is like 6‚Äô1 but has long ass arms so I‚Äôd rather he be like that than short arms and 6‚Äô3
to the jazz for donovan mitchell
"Guards that come into the NBA at an older age (after their junior or senior seasons in college) adapt quicker, like Donovan Mitchell, Malcolm Brogdon, and Damian Lillard. Most guards that leave after their freshman year in college take a while to hit their stride because they aren't as physically mature, the point guard position is in a golden age in the NBA with a lot of good/great veterans, and they don't know the tricks older players do"
"He was an all star but had a huge drop off.   * 2018: 23/5/4 and 2.5 spg on 58% TS * 2019: 19/5/5 and 1.7 spg on 52% TS only 38 games played  East all stars were really weak that year. You had Nikola Vucevic, Victor Oladipo and D'angelo Russel all making it (not bad players by any means) and in the West you had Donovan Mitchell, Luka Donƒçiƒá, Rudy Gobert, DeMar DeRozan, Draymond Green, Mike Conley and Marc Gasol all missing out. If he's in the West he's pretty solidly behind most of the aforementioned players and doesn't come close to a 2nd all star appearance."
"1. LeBron 2. Giannis 3. KD 4. AD 5. Steph 6. Kawhi 7. Harden 8. Dame 9. Luka 10. Jokic 11. Embiid 12. Paul George 13. Bradley Beal 14. Jayson Tatum 15. Devon Booker 16. Jimmy Butler 17. Jaylen Brown 18. KAT 19. Ben Simmons 20. Kyrie 21. CJ 22. Khris Middleton 23. Sabonis 24. Brandon Ingram 25. Chris Paul 26. Trae Young  I would take any of these players over Westbrook in a heartbeat and I'm probably forgetting others. He might compete for that next spot with Donovan Mitchell, Zach Lavine, and Vucevic."
"The later nets swaps and picks could very likely be lottery but anyways you can‚Äôt say something is guaranteed in the nba. The league changes way too quickly. Draft picks also aren‚Äôt a waste, where do you think all the players come from. Even in the late 1st rounds there are always gems like Donovan Mitchell. That 2022 draft is also going to be stacked."
"AD, Lebron, Giannis, Luka, Kawhi, Dame, Steph, Harden, Butler, Tatum, Westbrook, Jokic, Embiid, KD, Jimmy Butler, Chris Paul,  Paul George, Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, Bradley Beal, Andre Drummond."
That‚Äôs what I assumed as well but why would he want Donovan Mitchell of all people lmao
"Yeah I‚Äôve seen AD improve even more this year on his offense and shooting, I think he‚Äôll still easily be top 5 and get the super max when his contract runs out in 2024   Curry is about to turn 33 and has also had lots of health problems but he‚Äôs still a top 5 player and looks very fast on the court  Embiid is also 26 and very good, Bradley Beal is 27, Lavine getting better and he‚Äôs 25, Trae is 22, Donovan Mitchell 24, Ingram 23, Zion 20~ the nba has a lot of talent and some of these guys are improving a lot and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if in 5 years half of them are also better  The top 5 is usually also based off of playoff performance and history so if some of these guys make it to the finals or win a chip before him the conversation gets clearer"
Anybody else witness the flight of Donovan Mitchell?
 I didn‚Äôt realize that Dillon brooks is older than Donovan Mitchell.
Dillon Brooks is outplaying Donovan Mitchell
Calling a Donovan Mitchell lead team soulless kinda hurts. But I see what you mean.
Ja morant and Donovan Mitchell said he's a big influence on them. I think they just want to shoot better than him as well
Donovan Mitchell Trubisky
Donovan Mitchell better
Is donovan Mitchell a superstar?
Donovan Mitchell
"The Jazz are without doubt a better team than the Mavs but one thing thats true about a Jazz-Clippers series is that the Clippers will much more comfortably have the best player on the floor, and probably the second best as well. That makes a big difference.  However, I will concede that, based on what the Mavs have been able to accomplish in this series, the Jazz (who should still be focused on the grizzlies) have the right tools to compete with the Clippers. League best 3 point shooting, a great rim protector, and a guy in Donovan Mitchell who can penetrate and distribute (albeit far less effectively than Luka) the ball to shooters. The PnR is going to be absolutely huge for them, and in theory Rudy should help slow some of the bleeding against what appears to be a near unstoppable Kawhi Leonard."
&gt; but I don't know how we decided Utah and the Suns are some sort of regular season frauds while the 76ers and Bucks are legit.  They don't have top-end talent.  Top-end talent wins in the NBA the vast majority of the time. The upside for them is that the Lakers are crushed by injuries and the Clippers have shown themselves to be dysfunctional as hell.  But no team led by Rudy Gobert/Donovan Mitchell is gonna get the benefit of the doubt until they prove it against real MVP-level guys.
Playoff Donovan Mitchell aint no scrub now.
"So what I‚Äôm getting from this is Kemba is the best player on our team and the second best defender after Robert Williams plus he, Kyrie, CP3, Danny Green, Thybulle, and Donovan Mitchell are all equivalent players and better than Zion, Tatum, Booker, and Ingram."
"Out of Jamal Murray, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Zach Lavine and SGA that always get compared to each people usually say something like Murray &gt; SGA &gt; Mitchell &gt; Booker = Lavine on defense."
"Dude all these young guys are super comfortable and legit. Ja morant, Trae young, Donovan Mitchell. Devin booker is one or two classes earlier but hes finally getting the national stage to shine too"
"Kawhi, Giannis and Jokic are probably the main three examples of guys who achieved their potential in just about every conceivable way. They lack skills that there never part of their bag (playmaking, shooting and defense respectively), but they basically maxed out on their strengths.  Still, to say Wiggins' floor is PG is still a hot take. It'd be like saying Anthony Edwards' floor is Donovan Mitchell. You can see the similarities, but there's never a guarantee that they'll get to that level"
I think Utah can put up a lot of points and are the best offense. They got 2 6th men of the year candidates. Donovan Mitchell is underrated imo. They got a lot of different guys that can get it going any night.
Luka had neck issues. Mike Conley was out for a good portion. Cp3 had his left shoulder all messed up. Donovan Mitchell was out for one game and had lingering issues. Could count Jaylen brown before the playoffs as well. Klay been out the whole season.
And Luka lost. To a Clippers team much worse than the KD Warriors.   Donovan Mitchell has been horrendous in a few series losses to James Harden and the Rockets.  What point are you even trying to make?
The game has much higher variance now with the 3 point shot plus pace.  Losing a 2-0 lol was is not worse than losing any other way as the favorite. Winning is winning.  Is Jimmy Butler superior to Donovan Mitchell for getting swept in the first round?
" Excluding his OKC years where he was a 6th man he averages 28/7/6 on 42/33/87 shooting splits.   To compare, Donovan mitchell averages 29/5/5 on 43/39/86 efficiency. Efficiency wise not that different except for 3p% where donovan has a clear advantage.  As for showing up, in 2019 donovan mitchell had horrendous 32/25/73 shooting splits in the playoffs against none other than james harden's rockets.   On top of that Donovan mitchell does not get covered at nearly the same rate as James harden does. Try watching games.  There is no possible argument you could make about donovan showing up while harden doesnt.  For Luka,  he absolutely does show up to the moment like you said, averaging 34/10/9 on 49/39/60 splits. However, the sample size is simply too small. Hell, he averages more points than Jordan in the playoffs! But does that mean he shows up more than Jordan does? No, it's just too small a sample size  Seems like you're basing your opinion off of narratives."
Clippers path:  Mavs with Luka getting injured (Clips losing prior to this)  Jazz with hobbled Donovan Mitchell (Clips losing prior to this)  Suns with CP3 seemingly nowhere near 100% post-Covid to the point he's been detrimental to his team's play (Clips losing prior to his return)  Bucks without Giannis/Hawks with possibly Trae still injured
But Paul George isn‚Äôt on that level either.  Nobody has him as a top ten player in the league.  Before the playoffs people were putting guys like Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker above him.  I think Bill Simmons had him ranked between 20-25.  Weird that he‚Äôs held to a top 10 standard when nobody thinks he belongs anywhere near the top 10.
"Siakam has proven that he is able to the second or third guy on a championship level team. For the next couple of years, the Raptors won't be trading him for anything less than someone who could be the best player on a championship team. Maybe in the last year of his contract they might flip him for very speculative assets, but not anytime soon.  The Raptors don't make deals for the sake of making deals. Masai Ujiri turned down a bunch of offers he considered to be too low for Kyle Lowry this year, even though he might walk for nothing this summer.  Wiseman was disappointing this season, and didn't stay healthy. He might someday turn into a player you would build a championship team around, but that's looking less likely than him being a pretty good role player.  Even if the Raptors do want to eventually move on from Siakam, it makes more sense to hold on to him and wait for when some superstar level player gets disgruntled, and trade Siakam along with some first rounders for the Superstar. Dame, Donovan Mitchell, Tatum - all of them seem to be in super frustrating situations and may want to leave in a couple years."
confirmed  Donovan Mitchell to the Brooklyn Nets  Lets GO!
"Your bench is missing Chris Paul, Jaylen Brown, Donovan Mitchell, Booker, Embiid, Divincenzo, Dinwiddie, Beal, and Conley.  Thats like 2 fucking all star teams. Theyd probably have salary cap issues though."
Anthony Davis  James Harden  Kyrie Irving  Kawhi Leonard  Donovan Mitchell  Joel Embiid  Mike Conley  Jaylen Brown  Chris Paul  ---  No Trae or Jamal Murray
"&gt; The only people against the first amendment are liberals  So just to be clear, you have no problem with Donovan Mitchell wanting to talk to lawmakers about critical race theory, right?"
"Future mav, Donovan Mitchell"
No one is asking them to let donovan mitchell rewrite the constitution. He is making his voice and opinion heard. And yes if there is an 18 year old with that opportunity they should do so as well.
"Just commented this elsewhere:   There's some reports Donovan Mitchell is unhappy in Utah. He's also supposedly a huge Mets fan, and is from NY, and may want to go play there. Could something like this happen if that is all true?  Knicks get:   * Donovan Mitchell  Raptors get:   * RJ Barrett  Jazz get:   * Fred VanVleet  * 2021, 2023 Dallas picks (from Knicks)  * 2021, 2023 Knicks picks  That may seem like an overpay from a Knicks fan's perspective. But you're giving up a guy who *might* become a star for a guy who *is* a star, plus four non-lotto 1sts. And the star you're getting is a guy who loves NY and wants to be there. A Mitchell/Randle core is a good place to be. And you're really not leveraging the future since you're giving up Dallas picks and this year's 1st, you still have all but one of your future picks.   Raptors do it to trade a win-now player for a SG prospect with higher upside (and one who's Canadian to boot!). If they draft Suggs, they'd have a sexy young core with Suggs, RJ, GTJ, OG, Pascal   Jazz do it (again, if Donovan wants out) since they get a proven win-now guard (same height as Donovan, believe it or not) that will let them continue to contend. And those four 1sts could be used to further shore up the roster via trade. Maybe you offer the Rockets Favors and 6 1sts for Christian Wood. (Would be 6 1sts since none of them would be lotto picks). That would be a significant upgrade."

A Mitchell/Randle core is a good place to be. And you're really not leveraging the future since you're giving up Dallas picks and this year's 1st, you still have all but one of your future picks.   Raptors do it to trade a win-now player for a SG prospect with higher upside (and one who's Canadian to boot!). If they draft Suggs, they'd have a sexy young core with Suggs, RJ, GTJ, OG, Pascal   Jazz do it (again, if Donovan wants out) since they get a proven win-now guard (same height as Donovan, believe it or not) that will let them continue to contend. And those four 1sts could be used to further shore up the roster via trade. Maybe you offer the Rockets Favors and 6 1sts for Christian Wood. (Would be 6 1sts since none of them would be lotto picks). That would be a significant upgrade."
"I mean when you look at the entire resume from 12-now it looks kinda bad, but I think their front office has taken some pretty big swings and misses in the draft and free agency. Carlisle kept them at a league average floor. Like everyone points at Donovan Mitchell there for them in 2017, but fuck if DSJ was like Jarrett Allen or John Collins they'd probably still be bad enough to have gotten Luka in 2018 and have been more competitive these last couple years."
"I definitely feel like it's super overrated (because pretty much every other basketball type media show is trash) and has declined over the years. I also feel like a ton of people who think it's funny the whole time just watch clips. It's still a good show but Shaq has had like 5 lines of good analysis in 9 years of being on the show, constantly interrupts people when he disagrees, and has extremely whack moments pretty regularly (Ex. Donovan Mitchell interview), Kenny has become overly concerned with what's offense or not, and has become more sensitive than ever. All 4 of them barely watch the game anymore so the analysis has declined. I think it's a good show but the show was legendary in the 2000's for balancing comedy and solid analysis and the difference is more and more noticeable as the years go by."
Donovan Mitchell makes less than Shaq did in college.
"So what? Paul George, Jermaine O'Neal, Blake Griffin, and Alonzo Mourning all finished 3rd for MVP too.  So in Scotties absolute best year he was basically PG-13 (although he never had a year as good as 2019 PG). He's nowhere near a top 25 all time player or on the level a lot of people put him.  The other claim of leading his team to a second round exit that year. Does no one realize that literally 8 players do that every year. Like DeMar DeRozan and Donovan Mitchell have led their teams as far as Scottie did as a first option.  It's just strange to me that when people claim Scottie is overrated nowadays, everyone retorts with this 1994 season which doesn't do anything other than prove that his absolute peak was a nothing special."
"Well so there‚Äôs 2 things at play here, there‚Äôs the in your face racism of people shouting slurs, and there‚Äôs also institutional racism. Both are awful, and they‚Äôre not mutually exclusive, a city can certainly have problems with both.  That being said, Donovan Mitchell is incredibly wealthy, wherever he chooses to play, he may not be impacted by *some* parts of institutional racism - ie the effects of redlining, shitty public schools for his kids, etc. etc.  Purely as an example of institutional racism, and this is obviously anecdotal - I have never seen someone on here mention Houston as a racist city, or a city with a racism problem. But I‚Äôve spent a bit of time down there doing volunteer projects. The vast difference between the wealth in some parts of that city, in comparison to the *shocking* (and I truly mean *shocking*) levels of poverty in some of the *almost entirely* black neighborhoods of that city is sickening. And no one I talked to really seemed to bat an eye at it.  Now, if Donovan Mitchell moves to Houston, is any of that going to affect him? No, not at all, because he doesn‚Äôt have to live in those neighborhoods.  This is also a really important reason why the experiences of professional athletes can‚Äôt be the *only* lens in which we use to judge how racism affects our communities and how we really need to look around and ask about it ourselves."
While I agree that everyone should stay vigilant against racism in their area...  I feel like you're overlooking the fact that to someone who is affected by racism daily what seems like marginal improvement to others is a big deal. The difference between Salt Lake City and Miami or LA is huge if you're a person that's affected by racism.  Donovan Mitchell has been involved in more situations regarding race and his own home fanbase than I ever remember Kobe or DWade having to be.  I'm sure that becomes exhausting.
I don't see Donovan Mitchell in Utah long-term at all. He's not happy. I wouldn't be surprised if he requested a trade this summer or next.
"&gt;Jayson Tatum, Trae Young and Donovan Mitchell in the list of superstars because they are definitely better than AD lol  What the fuck lmao"
"You‚Äôre comparing positions that aren‚Äôt comparable. We‚Äôve seen throughout history that pretty much every big man need a lead guard whether it was Kareem, Shaq, Tim Duncan, Wilt, etc. Hell look at Jokic and Embiid this season with their main guard not performing their teams struggled heavily in the second round. The guard position in general is more of a floor raiser, and big man are more of a ceiling raiser. If you put Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young, and Tatum on the Lakers last season they don‚Äôt win a championship. You‚Äôre making an apples to oranges argument."
"No Serge Ibaka (Season ending back surgery)  Joe Ingles finishing 2nd beside (Jordan Clarkson) for 6th man of the year.  List can go on and on.  &amp;#x200B;  Jazz has accomplish nothing in their franchise history but my word do you guys talk so much shit just cause you got the 1st seed this season.  (To be fair the Clippers haven't done shit since it's entire existence as well)  But to go out and say I'm a Ignorant rebranded Lakers fan, when you can't even look at the other side of the argument and just go with  ""Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley is injured reason why we lost"" ""You're ignorant AF""  Get out of here with that weak petty shit.  &amp;#x200B;  Jazz fan have the same mentality as their roster.  They just give up and fold and just look for the easiest excuse."
"Yea, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm getting at.   Or how about it being reserved for highly educated, morally sound people who can better weigh the cost and benefits of a given policy?   But no, better hand over the reigns of the country to Lebron and Donovan Mitchell. Sounds smart."
The Kwame Brown video criticizing Donovan Mitchell will come out soon.
Selected ahead of Donovan Mitchell and Bam. Blazers fans must be sick.
"Hart, Lonzo, and Brandon Ingram.  Donovan Mitchell and Gobert."
"&gt;I can't see Donovan Mitchell anywhere but in Utah  He's been there for four season, lol. Chill."
&gt; The way Donovan Mitchell seen how his injury was handled in the playoffs really unnerved him.  didn't he only miss one game in a series they won?  was there another misstep or difference of opinion thats known?
Lol windhorst saying he THINKS wade might be concerned about Mitchell based off little to no evidence. This is the worst speculative reporting I have seen.   Donovan will reevaluate in 2-3 years based off how the Jazz have done as would any all star in his situation
"&gt; I can't see Donovan Mitchell anywhere but in Utah.  Yeah the 23 year old guy who has lived like 5% of his life in SLC. Really cant see him anywhere else.   I've been to SLC, it is great for what it is. Someone like Stockton can live there for 2 decades no problem. But a liberal young all-time wealthy black male may not have it at the top of his list."
Donovan Mitchell -- No.  Zion Williamson -- No.  Luka Doncic -- Yes.  Nikola Jokic -- Yes.  Joel Embiid -- No.
At first I thought you were saying Donovan Mitchell looks like charred beef and Rudy looks like an almond; I got confused who on the Jazz was supposed to look like a cum sock.
That's weird because I thought she was drooling over Donovan Mitchell way too much lol
Donovan Mitchell: No  Zion Williamson: No  Luka Doncic: No  Nikola Jokic: Yes  Joel Embiid: No
"The only guys off the top of my head that are top 30 players that have played in 1 place beyond the initial rookie deal and then 2nd contract (usually players will take the max and I think are UFA for these second contracts) are Dame and Giannis. Steph too but he‚Äôs won. I think every other player had been traded or left in FA. I think that‚Äôs why everyone though Giannis was leaving when Milwaukee hadn‚Äôt won yet, and why you‚Äôre hearing talks of Lillard wanting out, Beal might want out, this report about Donovan Mitchell, I‚Äôm sure by the end of the year we‚Äôll hear about Zach LaVine if Chicago is struggling. It‚Äôs so rare, almost non-existent that guys stay on 1 team their whole career anymore especially if they haven‚Äôt won.  I think it‚Äôs pretty foolish to think star players are going to stick around unless they have won within those first 6-9 years (depending on contracts and extension lengths). Even if they‚Äôre loyal, teams banging their heads against a wall for nearly a decade if it‚Äôs not working and they‚Äôll ship them off and hit the reset button."
"But saying that coming back is a factor is nuts. They dug themselves a hole first. It would have been more impressive to just win those games.   Regardless, Dirk played otherworldly/GOAT talent with Jason Terry as his number 2 to win that chip. This Clippers run wouldn't even compare. Beating Luka by himself, Jazz with Mike Conley out for most of the series and a hobbled Donovan Mitchell, and this Suns squad just doesn't compare to Dirk's run."
"I think it's been weird that people have been trying to speak into existence this thought that ""it'd be so cool to see CP3 win a ring""... but why? Dude's always been an asshole on the court.   And not every player needs to win a ring, especially once they are past their prime. If we're talking about ""how cool would it be individual X to win a ring,"" give me a young star at the top of their game carrying a team to a final. That's way cooler than a vet who is surrounded by young talent and solid roleplayers. Donovan Mitchell or Joker going nuclear and carrying their team to a chip would have been way cooler than CP3 having a nice assist/turnover ratio while Booker shoulders the scoring burden"
Donovan Mitchell to Mets confirmed?
"""I can't see Donovan Mitchell anywhere but in Utah""  He's been there for three years only..."
"This isn't really news. The Jazz are on the clock now that Mitchell has signed his extension. If they're not contenders three or four years from now, I can see Donovan requesting a trade a la Deron Williams."
"Bogie and Conley were massive pickups.  Jazz are a great team still, just had it rough with injuries.  Hard to blame him cause he was clearly hurt, but Donovan Mitchell was the one shooting them out of the last 2 games vs clippers. Shouldn‚Äôt have forced it when he clearly wasn‚Äôt 100%"
"Probably doesn't help that he plays in a racist state where the fans boo him for voicing his opinions on [black lives matter](https://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/donovan-mitchell-is-upset-that-some-utah-jazz-fans-were-critical-of-his-views-on-racial-equality)/[juneteenth](https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2020/06/20/donovan-mitchells/) and where black visiting players are constantly heckled with racist insults. Or the fact that he probably doesn't actually get along too well with Gobert who almost killed him regarding the Covid fiasco. Don is a huge germaphobe and Gobert pulled some super disrespectful shit. I know they say they're cool now, but I'm sure behind closed doors there is animosity. Also doesn't help that their $35 million per year C is played off the court every playoffs."
&gt;The way Donovan Mitchell seen how his injury was handled in the playoffs really unnerved him.  Because they refused to let him play injured?
"Donovan Mitchell for Grayson Allen, straight up"
&gt;	I can't see Donovan Mitchell anywhere but in Utah.   lol come on now
"Luka is like 10x bigger than Book and Donovan. Book is a bit bigger than Bev, Mitchell is similar size. Luka is a solid 30 pounds heavier and 7 inches taller than Bev so it‚Äôs way easier for him to post up"
"I mean, he has definitely said some clownish shit and hyped up performances that he subsequently flopped in.  But he has been fucking amazing these playoffs and for the majority of this season and last season.  The hate is definitely excessive, but I sorta disagree he's been a perfect professional outside of asking for a trade in Indy.  Asking for a trade 1 year into your max extension in OKC was kinda ridiculous, and then he's said various things over the past several years that he failed to follow through on, which is why he was so easy to clown.  He was the one who invented the nickname ""playoff P.""  He said ""Y'all ain't met Playoff P yet, huh?"" before OKC played the Jazz in the playoffs and a rookie Donovan Mitchell embarrassed em right after.  He's an amazing player, way overhated, but also kind of a clown sometimes.  It's not all just made up shit, he's definitely had some pretty bad moments."
How did Donovan Mitchell play through all the defense?
Book is going full Donovan Mitchell with some of those shots.
So Donovan Mitchell and 4 giants?
"Dante Exum could have been great. I think he could have become what Donovan Mitchell is right now. He had so much promise, it's truly a shame."
"Mike Conley, Donovan Mitchell"
"Dennis Lindsey also traded for Jordan Clarkson and drafted Donovan Mitchell...but yea, burn his ass down"
Start Dante Exum he was picked higher than Donovan Mitchell
The Donovan Mitchell vs Jamal Murray series was super fun
Luka and donovan mitchell gonna be a nice 1-2 punch for NY in a few years
"Lonzo almost certainly wouldn't be involved because he's a RFA. It's possible, but complicated.   The real question is if BI goes or not.   If BI stays, a starting lineup of Dame, Lonzo, BI, Zion and Adams or Jaxson Hayes will put up record breaking offense and the only question will be defense and depth.   They can use Bledsoe and remaining picks to grab defense and depth though, targeting guys like Hield, Barnes, Duncan Robinson, Norman Powell, OG Anunoby and maybe PJ Tucker.  Regardless of whl they get to fill out the roster, that's definitely a top 3 seed if healthy.   If BI goes, that'll likely leave the Pelicans with 5ish tradable 1st round picks along with 5ish swaps and at least one promising young player. Basically what the Clippers gave up for PG.   They could use those to go for the 3rd star, along with salary from Bledsoe or Adams to go after a guy like Jeremi Grant, Jaylen Brown, Siakam, Sabonis, Donovan Mitchell, PG, SGA or KAT, depending on who becomes available."
"The Suns are better than the Jazz, especially with a hobbled Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley."
Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker were much bigger snubs than Tatum.
idk what he‚Äôs doing doesn‚Äôt seem much more impressive than what Donovan Mitchell has done the last 2 seasons but he‚Äôs not even considered a top 10 player
"The Jazz would be the favorites to win the title if Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley, and Karl Malone were 100% healthy and had also time traveled into versions of their bodies and minds that were at their 100% peak conditions"
Can anyone reasonably claim Dame or Donovan Mitchell are ring chasers?
Donovan Mitchell going to request a trade to Brooklyn.
"Sad that a lineup of Donovan Mitchell, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Giannis, Middleton and Trae Young is considered a ‚Äúnightmare scenario.‚Äù The NBA really needs to figure out how to market small markets, the NFL doesn‚Äôt seem to struggle with it on nearly the same level. Shit, just this year they had Tampa Bay vs Green Bay and that was one of the most hyped matchups of the year. (yes I know they both have elite quarterbacks, but the point stands; the NFL found a way to make a game with 2 of the smallest markets in the league incredibly hyped up) Edit: words"
"I feel bad for both kd and Donovan Mitchell, both played like crazy in their respective series but just couldn‚Äôt make it"
Which sort of proves why that move was so shit. It should be superstar v superstar. Same with last night with Paul George going up against Donovan Mitchell.
yes but my point is that even if mitchell was hobbled the end result was that he played far better than anyone expected even for a healthy donovan. the jazz had more than enough pieces to win with the performances of mitchell especially without a top 2 playoff scorer on the clips for the last two games.
"No they were not.  The hawks were led by Paul millsap dropping 16 a game. Donovan mitchell dropped 26 this year. How the hell is that a ""No superstar"" team."
"Haha. And Donovan isn't well-liked? I'm not a Beal stan, apparently that needs to be clarified. Any objective observer would agree with my statement. But don't just rely on platitudes, check any of the publicly available defensive metrics. Beal was a good defender for his first four seasons. Mitchell has just finished his fourth season. He is playing with one of the best defenders in the league, yet he is a consistently minus defender."
Donovan Mitchell deserves much better than a comparison to Jeff Teague
"no, when awful defenders like jordan clarkson or donovan mitchell are beat off of the dribble by guys like paul george, they are not going to recover and force an inefficient result. they require help defense. very simple.   your lack of understanding of basic basketball defense is ridiculous lol  and no one followed you into a different thread"
"You can make a similar argument about any offensively/defensively skilled player with holes to the other side of their game but it will be incoherent because of hard it is to be a two-way player.   For example, what if Donovan Mitchell was a lock-down perimeter defender? Then we wouldn't be talking about Gobert's offensive weaknesses at all. Instead, the tone of discussion on this sub would probably be directed towards clowning Paul George and lamenting the impact that injuries have on deciding the playoffs.   Being able to dominate at both ends is rare, takes a level of conditioning that most guys don't have, and is what makes players like Kawhi special."
"Because its ridiculous that Donovan Mitchell didnt get it and I said ok, he still had much more regular season success when it comes to leading his team to wins and still had way more success in the postseason. I don't really consider All NBAs now due to the amount of narrative that goes into it. Is Trae Young not All NBA level when he averages 30/10 with a good record? Thats ridiculous."
Tbf Donovan Mitchell and Jordan clarkson have already lived up to what they‚Äôre payed.    Gobert didn‚Äôt. He has to handle all the media and do the teams laundry at this point considering his play and contract.
"Yeah they won‚Äôt have a shot like this again, unfortunate because I love Donovan Mitchell"
"&gt; as if it's some huge accomplishment for a star to make a deep run if Lebron or KD carries a player there, while they warm the bench.  I didn't realize you were delusional enough to think Gobert would ride the bench.  &gt;...it's not like anyone said ""Kyrie is a guaranteed fit for any team""....it's more that Gobert for 30% of the cap is guaranteed liability on any team.  Crazy how he finished with a better +/- than Donovan Mitchell, and a *significantly* better one through 5 games while being a liability."
i thought donovan mitchell has like 35 ppg in the playoffs
"&gt;Yeah idk to me it‚Äôs the fact that your 3x DPOY is being hunted in the playoffs routinely like he‚Äôs fuckin Lou Will.  This didn't happen routinely. Prior to this game, Gobert was +5 in a 3 point win, +14 in a 6 point win, -16 in a 26 point loss, -1 in a 14 point loss, -4 in an 8 point loss, and then -24 in a 12 point loss.  Gobert was a -2 over the series coming into Game 6.   Donovan Mitchell was -22 coming into Game 6.    Even after a disastrous Game 6, Gobert still finished the series with a -26 to Mitchell's -31.   Gobert has clear flaws, but so do the overwhelming majority of players, including Donovan Mitchell, who everyone loves and thinks Utah should build around.   People are being insanely hyperbolic about how bad his flaws are and how negatively they're impacting the Jazz. He's an above-average value max contract."
"If you can't notice the racism on ESPN when they talk about the NBA then I don't know what to say.  Every black player is Stephen A's BRUTHA MR. DOMINATION SUPA STA while Luka and Jokic are ""a'ight.""  Let's see who are Stephen A's ""THIS BRUTHA IS SPECIAL FUTURE OF THE NBA.""  Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Trae Young, etc... no Luka, no Jokic.  The mere fact Jokic wasn't a 100/100 first team All NBAer says it all as well.  Who voted him 2nd team?"
Bro what? This has nothing to do with race. Obviously your character shows itself here if discussing stats and post season success turns into ‚Äúwhite hate‚Äù just because he favors Donovan Mitchell over Luka.  You Luka fan boys are all waiting to use the ‚ÄúyOu hAtE HiM cUz hE‚Äôs wHiTe!!1!!‚Äù argument at the drop of a hat lmfaooo
Go watch the highlights‚Ä¶ they where just simple layups. No crazy athletic shots like MJ or Donovan Mitchell‚Ä¶ just simple put backs and layups. Yes I think a more agile athletic defender could have a) blocked him out b) been fast enough to move his feet to prevent such simple attempts c) been able to close out on him on the three‚Ä¶ Mann 7 threes last night‚Ä¶ 5 of those Rudy G was guarding him. So Mann all of a sudden has a Career high night out of the blue‚Ä¶ every shot he made was pretty straightforward‚Ä¶ all because Rudy G was guarding him‚Ä¶ not because Mann is some unstoppable offensive force. Quinn Snyder tried the same thing 4 games in a row‚Ä¶ 2 of those games was without K Leonard‚Ä¶ so yeah it‚Äôs safe to say using Rudy in that was was not effective‚Ä¶ Snyder was out coached man. 4 straight losses and a blown lead‚Ä¶ gotta try something else man.
You again trying to take away from pat bevs impressive defense. My man just locked up Donovan Mitchell and you‚Äôre still spewing your dumb takes. Should‚Äôve learned after last week to never comment in a Patrick Beverly defense post ever again
You again trying to take away from pat bevs impressive defense. My man just locked up Donovan Mitchell and you‚Äôre still spewing your dumb takes. Should‚Äôve learned after last week to never comment in a Patrick Beverly defense post ever again
"Agreed. Very tough to get to get to the level of a Donovan Mitchell with no love for the game and no passion. They all go hand in hand. And the guys who are there to ""collect checks"" usually aren't in the limelight or focal points of their team anyway."
"Donovan Mitchell is a turnstile?   I thought a Wolves fan would know, having DeAngelo Russel on the team, what a turnstile looks like"
"My observations:  &amp;#x200B;  1. Gobert has to help on PG, otherwise that's an easy lay up for PG. Donovan has to switch to the corner 3. He doesn't even make an effort to close out to T Mann. That's just poor effort from Donovan. He retreats out to Batum when he should have gone to the corner spot. That would have led to a pass to Batum, at which point Bojan has to rotate to Batum, which then would have led to a pass to Morris and Conley should rotate out to Morris. Finally, Morris would probably make the open pass to Reggie but at that point, O'Neale would have to rotate out to Reggie. By this time, there's probably 8-10 secs left on the clock and the ball wouldn't be moving as much. If you're the Jazz, this is 100% the better option as opposed to leaving Mann open at the corner 3 spot. Key thing here is rotation, rotation and rotation.  2. Again, Gobert comes to help. Nothing wrong with that. However, it's not on Gobert to close out to Mann. That's on Donovan again. You kind of have to split the difference between Mann and Batum, but the way Donovan is positioned, he's more concerned about Batum. Just look at all that space when Reggie makes the pass. Pay attention to when the ball bounces on the floor on the way to Mann's shooting pocket. Again, Donovan doesn't even try to close out to the corner shooter. Poor effort yet again. Gobert is in such a bad spot. If he closes out hard, he might foul Mann in the shooting motion.  3. Good defence by Gobert to start. I feel like Donovan should have taken another step closer to Batum and not be close to Reggie the moment Reggie passes to Batum. Batum is a smart player. He probably realized Donovan wouldn't contest the shot so he lets it fly. This is not on Gobert, this is on Donovan yet again. No effort for the third straight 3 pt shot with him being the closest defender each and every time. 4. Closest defender to Mann is Ingles, not Gobert. Ingles has to split the difference here, not be that close to Morris. Pause at the very moment Mann is just about to catch the ball and when he begins his shot wind up. Ingles is walking back. What kind of defence is this? How can you pin this on Gobert? Again, if he closes out too hard, he might foul Mann. This play is on Ingles. You have to split the difference here. By doing so, this allows O'Neale to swing to the wing spot to guard/contest Morris.  5. Same thing as 4. While Ingles did a better job at splitting the difference, he should have fully committed to contesting Mann's shot. O'Neale has to rotate out to Morris. Morris probably would have passed to PG up top at which point Conley would have to rotate out to PG. This would have left about 4-6 secs left on the clock. With Conley guarding PG, you take take any day (considering there would have been 4-6 secs left) over leaving a corner 3 shooter wide open. 6. Effort more so than anything. Clarkson has to close out faster than this. Either Clarkson fully commits to contesting the 3 by swinging right by him (not this half-assed close out) or he sprints fast enough and scares/stunts on Reggie and forces the Clippers to start the play all over again. Pause at the moment Reggie is in the shooting motion with the ball right over his head (right when the shot clock resets to 14). Look at how much space Reggie has. I don't even know what to say at this point. Everything I described so far leading up to point 6 comes down to two things: rotations and effort. Let's continue. 7. Hands up O'Neale, hands up!!! Pause at 4.9 secs left on the clock. Reggie is ready to let it fly. Ball in the shooting pocket and knees bent, all signs pointing to shooting the ball.   Come on O'Neale. He has to assume that Reggie is gonna shoot. Chances are, Reggie is not gonna drive right and run in to Gobert. He's waiting to shoot. Put your hands up Royce! 8. Gobert is a split second late. He was in the paint for a split second longer than he needed to be. He's way too flat footed here. He has to properly contest this shot. Jump high and contest the shot man, come on.  9. Donovan completely lost track of the corner man. Donovan retreats out to Luke and forgets Pat Bev is in the corner. You HAVE to split the difference in these situations. If Donovan properly closes out to Pat Bev, he would have passed to Luke and Bojan would have to split the difference/rotate out to Luke. Once again, Donovan's lack of awareness is on full display.  10. I feel like for the most part, Gobert has good positioning to contest PG's shot but again, he has to jump higher and have his hands raised high. His right hand is tilted downwards when it should be pointed up high. The goal here is to disrupt PG's vision on the shot attempt. Better/stronger close out was needed. PG has way too much space to get the shot off. 11. Bojan is surveying his side of the court which is great. As soon as PG is about to make the pass, notice how his head is turned backwards/over his left shoulder towards Mann at the 17 sec mark. He probably thought Mann was going to drive/cut to the basket. Even if Mann attempts to drive/cut to the basket, Gobert is sitting in the paint. Bojan has to be two steps closer to Batum here. Gobert has to take ownership and communicate with Bojan by telling him to be closer to Batum, not Mann. 1.  This right here is a lack of awareness by Bojan and Gobert.  12. Conley starts off by splitting the difference between Mann and Batum. This is what you want. Otherwise, Mann will be left completely open. You want to force Mann into making a decision - do I shoot or pass to my guy Batum? Conley gambles here by trying to steal the ball. You can only respect the effort here. However, when the pass goes out to Mann, Conley doesn't even make an attempt at closing out. He just gave up here. Complete lack of effort to end the defensive play. Why Conley? You did so well to start. You split the difference and attempted to steal the ball. Why did you just give up at the end? 13. Heat check shot by Pat Bev really. What more can you do here? For starters, get your hands up Bojan. You're daring Pat Bev to shoot, this is what you get. 14. Same thing as point 10. Gobert has to have his right hand up higher. Look at where his right hand is. It seems like his right hand palm is at eye-level. It has to be high above your head. You got a long reach, use it! Wtf you doing with this half-assed attempt at closing out? You want to disrupt Pat Bev's vision here.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Notice a trend here? Most of these plays, there was a defensive breakdown. Rotations were missed. Effort was missing. That's on the coach and the defensive anchor Rudy to tell his guys where they need to be. You see how Draymond is always yelling out to his guys where they need to be? Yea, that's more like it. What's one player that sticks out the most in all these plays above? Donovan Mitchell. He has poor awareness, vision and effort on the defensive side. Clippers were not only trying to exploit Gobert, they were trying to exploit Donovan too."
I feel so bad for these players that have to do a media conference right after one of the most disappointing moments of their life. It's gotta suck so bad to be Donovan Mitchell or Gobert in that situation.
"This post is disgusting üòÇ the Celtics gonna trade for Donovan Mitchell without attaching Jaylen brown, the Knicks are gonna offer some low ceiling rookies just bc they peaked early, ditto for the Spurs, and my favorite of all is the overall theme of just adding  ‚Äúpicks‚Äù to anything like that apparently makes it appealing. Yll are delusional"
"PG is an elite 2-way player, Donovan Mitchell is a bad defender. PG is the better player of the two. Also Mitchell plays a lot of hero-ball, he makes some insane shots but there is no guarantee that their offensive flow will stay intact after he cools down. Examples being the second halves of games 5 and 6."
"Donovan Mitchell, it's not close, and I won't stand for this augmenting of PG talk. No contributions from Reggie Jackson and Terrence Mann, no Clippers in the WCF."
i don't think they can beat the bucks 4 out of 7 games with Jrue healthy. Terrence Mann is not gonna be able to do him like he did Donovan Mitchell on one ankle last night.
They lose by 20+ instead of 10  Nothing is changing with how laughable their perimeter defense was with who you put at the 5. One legged Donovan Mitchell was a disaster on defense total barbecue chicken Jordan Clarkson and others sure didn‚Äôt help either. Team wide defensive disaster
"I have faith in Donovan Mitchell, but not the Jazz so much anymore. Donovan will either continue to carry the team or get traded to a team that is more consistently talented. I had faith in Rudy Gobert, but as soon as he won DPOY he stopped playing defense!"
"There are quite a few other good player who are much more likely to become available sooner than Donovan Mitchell IMO. Players on a rookie contract rarely have much leverage, kristaps forced his way out but he‚Äôs the only one I can think of and it hasn‚Äôt exactly worked out that well for him"
Donovan Mitchell has proven to be one of the most elite shot creators in the playoffs over the last couple of years. I'm taking him.
Donovan Mitchell. Younger for one and hasn‚Äôt had as serious of injuries. PG is a good 2nd star player but I think the upside of Mitchell as of now is better than PG now.
"I just posted these.  Same situation.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3ugYxkJZs4&amp;t=3m26s  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0sKRFJDXdI  0:44 - Royce should be full on sprinting to chase Reggie off the line  1:31 - Donovan should be rotating  2:11 - Again, Ingles backs away from the rotation  2:40 - Clarkson is just jogging on defense  3:03 - Clarkson is oblivious  3:37 - Mitchell forgets to rotate   I'm probably not 100% on all of these, but that's the general idea.  When you watch the Rockets vs Warriors a few years ago, the Rockets were pedal to the metal on rotations and close outs.  The Jazz are taking a nice leisurely drive."
#DID YOU JUST COMPARE DONOVAN MITCHELL TO MICHAEL FUCKING JORDAN IN 90S BASKETBALL LMAO
"KAT would prevent the Clippers from going small and raining hellfire from deep themselves  The Clippers would have to sacrifice one of their wings for Zubac to try and match KAT in size, can't have someone half a foot shorter trying to guard KAT in the post. Also KAT's threat to pick&amp;pop would prevent the Clippers jamming up the lane.  The Jazz would suffer defensively from having KAT instead of Rudy, but the offensive potential it opens up gives them more ways to attack the Clippers rather than just giving the ball to Donovan Mitchell to hero-ball."
Does Donovan Mitchell play defense like Kawhi or PG?   Scoring isn‚Äôt everything.
"Donovan Mitchell in the playoffs is not Donovan Mitchell all year long.  If he plays during the regular season like he did during the last 2 playoffs, then sure.  He'd then be a top 12 player and be right by Dame.  But he's done this for 13 games, not 82 games + 16 games.  EDIT: Like unless you're Joe Dumars, you're not thinking Ben Gordon is a superstar because of only playoff runs."
How long does Donovan Mitchell want to stay? Is he like Dame?
Okay Gobert didn't give it to him. Sorry.  But they did have some kind of discord last year:  https://www-espn-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29406398/utah-jazz-stars-donovan-mitchell-rudy-gobert-rift-them?amp_js_v=a6&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;platform=amp&amp;usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D#aoh=16241174636753&amp;csi=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.espn.com%2Fnba%2Fstory%2F_%2Fid%2F29406398%2Futah-jazz-stars-donovan-mitchell-rudy-gobert-rift-them
I hope Donovan recognizes his blame in this.  That second half offensively was on him.  Possession after possession going 2 v 1 and getting nothing?  He abandoned his teammates for 10-20 offensive possessions straight.  They are a great offensive team even without Mitchell yet he got tunnel vision and fucked them in the end.  He needs to mature.  I'm not saying he isn't an offensive monster.  But you gotta keep with the teamwork
FREE DONOVAN MITCHELL
"&gt; I‚Äôm not really putting Donovan Mitchell up there with those guys  Then he's not a superstar, that's the point. Maybe you just have your own, VERY loose definition of who's a superstar, and then Booker, Butler, PG, Tatum, etc. are all superstars too... For me that's superstar inflation, that's just us being too nice to say some are stars, but some are superstars."
Booker isn't a bad defensive player and it's not like Paul George is as good as he once was defensively.  Donovan Mitchell cooked him this series when he got the switch to the point where they had to double him.
"Donovan Mitchell is probably a top 5 1rst option in the league. Fully healthy he would have had a fifty point game or two like he did with the nuggets last year. When the guy gets hot, he's incredible."
"It already feels like it right now. It already felt like a bad contract at the time. I was on team let Rudy walk then and I'm in team trade him now. We built a Spurs system around Donovan Mitchell, are we stupid? We should have built a Miami system, he plays like D Wade with a 3.  Shaq was right though, he was wrong about Don but he was spot on about Rudy and that albatross contract"
Oh yeah Donovan Mitchell did not look hurt once during that series
"More people don‚Äôt talk about this. You are not a superstar if you don‚Äôt make your team mates better and the last two games the loss is on Donovan. Completely ball hogs and hero balls it and takes some terrible shots. Those guys on the jazz can all shoot, but when it‚Äôs iso after iso or screen and shoot for Mitchell it takes them out of the game. Dude needs to change or no one will want to play with him."
"I was referring to Don. No he was not and neither was Ryan Smith. Blow it all up, sell everyone but Donovan for parts. Maybe try to trade Gobert for an expiring deal or two if anyone wants him. We could always send him to OKC with a first to Presti, at leasts Kemba's albatross contract gives us a shooter.  I think I'd keep Royce and Clarkson since they play well with Mitchell but they also shouldn't be untouchable"

"Even tho I am a clippers fan, I have nothing but respect for Rudy Gobert and Donovan mitchell. The man played his heart out. And when he slipped in last minute of the game it totally freaked me out. I hope he isn't hurt or something."
"‚ÄúThey‚Äôll call it quits if we make them‚Äù -Donovan Mitchell, earlier in this series, in reference to the Clippers"
"Sam Presti to Zanik ""You can keep Donovan Mitchell or multiple 1st rounders.""      Zanik: ""Donovan Mitchell is Donovan Mitchell but a 1st round pick can be anything! It can even be a Donovan Mitchell! You know how long we've have been wanting one of those!"""
"The problem is that in this series, it seems like Donovan Mitchell is a one man show for the Jazz, just like Luka Doncic on the Mavs. That doesnt win many playoff series"
The Jazz fans trying to tell everyone he‚Äôs thier best player over Donovan Mitchell need their IQ checked
They're basing it off the regular season and it's undeniably true in that setting. Things just change come playoff time and that's where Donovan takes over. I'm not sure why everybody is so mad over this?   Gobert being the better regular season player is as undeniable as Mitchell being the better post season player. It's like Draymond and Iggy said. There are 82 game players and there are 16 game players.
"I love this dude forreal, I've been rooting for Donovan Mitchell for quite awhile. I'm a Louisville fan and it sucks seeing the Jazz lose like that."
lol Donovan Mitchell is better than Stockton. Malone is the unquestioned Jazz GOAT. And I hate them both but Malone made Stockton not the other way around.
"NBA players do not fear or respect Gobert‚Äôs game man. Bro has sand in his legs, he can‚Äôt move his feet. Jazz gotta get off of him or Donovan Mitchell is gonna wanna go to a different team."
"I remember that I told in the play in that utah jazz was great in open season and not that great in playoffs and everyone hated me. Well, sorry for utah to be honest, I like donovan Mitchell but they are not a team to win a ring."
"this just in: 6'1"" Patrick Beverly can guard 6'1"" Donovan Mitchell, but not 6'7"" Luka Doncic"
"To be fair.. You played a fringe playoff team and then a team missing the cog of their offense, who beat out Donovan Mitchell in a duel last year.  You guys had it easy.  We‚Äôll see if Ayton can hang with the small ball brigade"
&gt; All without Kawhi Leonard  I entered this thread thinking about how a healthy Donovan Mitchell would have swung this but completely forgot Kawhi is out! Great performance by the Clippers.
the Donovan Mitchell rumour train is about to leave the station...
"Well, they have 4 other players who can start playing better defense. That would be good. Honestly, Gobert is awkward at times, but he can go out to the perimeter. It's just that the rest of the Jazz can't stop anything going to the rim. Donovan Mitchell got bodied by Reggie Jackson in an ISO. That's going to keep happening without Gobert covering for him in the paint.  And Jokic actually isn't all that bad stepping up at times either, I think he just started running out of steam in that Suns series, had to do too much on both ends."
"There are 82 game players and 16 game players.  Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell."
"have you watched the series? i don't blame you if not, lot of ugly basketball. like donovan mitchell being a fucking traffic cone on defense lmao?? conley was bad defensively today as well, and royce o'neal's defense has been a massive disappointment. pg torched him in g5"
"In all honesty the Mavs look pretty good for taking the Clips to a Game 7 against a better team and Clips had Kawhi for the whole Mavs series. The Jazz roster top to bottom is much better than ours after Luka and Donovan cancel each other out. Well, maybe Luka is a little better than Mitchell vs a team like the Clippers bc if his shot isnt falling Luka can just post his defender up. Against the Mavs Beverly couldnt even get on the court bc Luka just abused him over and over lol. But props to the Clips they have a great team."
"People may be surprised to learn that Terance, despite being in just his 2nd year in the NBA, turns 25 this year.  He's the same age as Donovan Mitchell."
"Honestly, although he wasn't even close to acceptable tonight, the reason why they lost was because of the lack of adaptability in roster and defensive game planning. Rudy Gobert plugs a lot of holes for Jazz players who can't contain for shit on the perimeter, or even provide help rim protection. He's always existed on an island and the Jazz are where they are despite that.  Regardless, if they put all their chips on him standing in the paint and other teams 5th man missing open 3s, they're going to get burned a lot. It's the playoffs, and outliers become a regular occurrence in big moments. Now if Gobert chases perimeter players, what does the Jazz actually have in rim protection? Is Bogdanovic going to slide in? Do they play Favors as a 4, have 2 non shooters on offense and 2 slower bigs rotating in the half court? If they take Gobert off the court, are the rest of the Jazz players going to step up and not hide behind Gobert's rim protection? I saw Donovan Mitchell get bullied by Reggie Jackson in an iso, that would become a regular occurrence.  Jazz are locked into a player who plugs too many holes on defense and can easily be jump shot into oblivion. The only 3 options going forward are a) hope to god small teams just miss their jump shots all the way to a chip b) get some new creativity in defensive coaching with or without Quinn and c) trade Gobert to make an adaptable roster and risk having all the Jazz perimeter players exposed on defense."
"The Clippers are a more talented and deeper team. Without Kawhi, maybe not, but you're right, they're just a better coached team. I don't know if it's that surprising. The Jazz were pretty reminiscent of the Hawks and Raptors and many other fun regular season teams with ball movement. I wasn't even convinced that Donovan Mitchell had reached that next level.   I still don't know, but he's definitely better than anyone on those Hawks or Raptors teams. It's just that the roster is fairly flawed and filled with inconsistent offensive players and poor defenders."
"&gt; Boban and even Porzingis could abuse mismatches Gorbert refuses or can't exploit.  Goddamn that really puts it in perspective lol (not too sure about zingis tho). Although I will add that it's probably more of the Luka+Boban / Porzingis / whatever other big combo than those bigs alone and it's possible that a healthy Conley would've similarly allowed Utah to do a better job at punishing small-ball. As good as Donovan Mitchell is, Conley was definitely a better facilitator"
"Congrats clippers fans been rooting for this team since the start of the playoffs. Y‚Äôall did it I can‚Äôt imagine the emotions of the OG fans. Your team went out there and did it against a 3x dpoy and Donovan Mitchell without your teams best player. Legendary shit, party up boys sober up and get game, WCF coming up!!!!!!!!!!! Mannnnnnnnnnnnnnn, what a game!"
"I mean the whole basketball world is rightfully giving the Jazz shit right now, but still give credit where it's do. Jazz clawed back from down 20 in game 1, and had a injured Donovan Mitchell for the whole series."
Donovan Mitchell to the Lakers! /s
No. Gobert lead the Jazz to the best record in the NBA even with Donovan Mitchell out for a large chunk of the season. He played 41 minutes tonight. Having a defensive specialist is a fine strategy. It's he over paid? Sure but the talk about his contract his overblown  The Jazz lost because of playoff experience.
Donovan Mitchell is clearly not that hurt if he‚Äôs scoring 39.  How much more would he have scored tonight if fully healthy.  How many did Kawhi score with a torn acl
"Lmao  ""Gobert is literally the best player in the NBA at many crucial skillsets that are critical to winning basketball games.  Donovan Mitchell is NOT the best player in the NBA at ANY crucial skillset, critical to winning basketball games.  Rudy Gobert is the best BASKETBALL player on the Jazz""  Good take very smart Jazz fan lol üëç they just read more advanced stats gg man we never had a chance against their superior knowledge"
"Hey what‚Äôs up. I just had to revisit this convo. It was a great series and I give so much props to the Utah Jazz. Donovan Mitchell is, no doubt, an elite superstar. So Jazz fans, keep your heads up cuz it ain‚Äôt over for the Jazz. You guys have a bright future ahead of you with Donovan leading the way."
OMG that was so satisfying to watch Utah implode in the 2nd half. Up 2-0 to lose 4 straight with Kawhi out 2 of those games. That is pathetic showing from a #1 seed. Not a fan of Donovan Mitchell so it was icing on the cake. Hahahahahahahahaha
Literally only two people are... and KD got this carry a team to championship reputation where? From his time on the hardest road?   Donovan Mitchell is a number 1 if anyone is.
Because when you wanna be the superstar you gotta win games. Donovan Mitchell needs a superstar next to him that can score.
Gobert a defensive player having this atrocious performance in an elimination game is the equivalent of if Donovan Mitchell were to have a 7 points on 3-15 shooting game. Gobert absolutely deserves shit
Donovan ‚ÄúAlonzo Mourning‚Äù Mitchell  https://media.tenor.com/images/0d0bd84807bdddd32434da90da3a5398/tenor.gif
"&gt; As a **Donovan Mitchell** fan, Donovan Mitchell should play for another team  Fixed it for OP"
I don't think he should play for another team. You all should worry about Gobert and his contract.  Give Donovan Mitchell good teammates and a good coach and y'all good.
Believing in averages doesn‚Äôt mean there won‚Äôt be an outlier. You called out my statement about Donovan Mitchell and 3s being their only offense by saying Clarkson dropped 20. In the end everything averaged out for the Jazz and their only offense was Donovan Mitchell and 3s. Problem was the 3s stopped hitting like I expected.  Good season tho man. Hopefully we can watch a rematch next year.
They also spent all year saying he is better than Donovan Mitchell. So disrespectful to their superstar player for no reason whatsoever.
Donovan Mitchell deserves better
"im rly high n i was thinking, i started watching basketball during the bubble playoff last year as i got autisticly into basketball like last year around may when the last dance came out n i watched it high af, since then i started watching and out of the live matches i have seen over the last year donovan mitchell is like the best player i have seen with ''my eyes''"
"I don't know who to blame, but I feel confident it isn't Donovan Mitchell"
"I agree, Donovan Mitchell is a turnstile."
Wtf Donovan Mitchell is absolutely a #1 option.
"Regardless of Utah flaming out badly, Donovan Mitchell is a superstar. This year in the playoffs, he averaged 35 points, and just as importantly, has been much more efficient. His only real ""bad"" game was game 5 when everyone else was draining everything, so he let them, then tried to play hero ball when they made nothing in the second half."
Donovan Mitchell still has the shiniest lips in the league
There‚Äôs been some incredible performances this postseason but I don‚Äôt think anyone has grown in my esteem more than Donovan Mitchell. The guy was clearly hurt the whole time and is fucking going all out all the time. I‚Äôd go to war with that guy any day
Donovan Mitchell averaged like 40 on like 45% 3pt shooting on all deep contested stepbacks
"Nah I was being sarcastic, his draft resume is extremely unimpressive outside of CJ and Dame.    He's failed to find quality starters through the draft. You can make excuses for any draft pick, but he's whiffed on Collins and Swanigan. Trent Jr. was a good find. Simons and Little are meh. And he's missed on players like Donovan Mitchell, Keldon Johnson, Bam, and KPJ recently.    A good GM needs to be able to occasionally hit on SOME of these picks. It's been 8 years and the best you can say is that certain picks were decent. How many of these guys were in Portland's playoff rotation?"
Jamal Murray is really good. He was great in the bubble and then struggled early in the season so I know this subreddit was ripping on him. He's a similar player to Donovan Mitchell. Not always the most consistent player but when the lights are bright they play well and can carry a team.  MVP Jokic + playoff Murray would have been really fun to watch. Porter could have just done his thing as the third option and Aaron Gordon could have focused on his defense and energy more so. I know there were a ton of injuries for these playoffs but I feel this one was one of the biggest.
Knicks make one playoff appearance and suddenly forget they drafted Frank Nilikina and Kevin Knox over SGA and Donovan Mitchell
1) Dame sending home the Thunder. That whole game was electric and there was the whole Russ mini-beef  2) Game 6 2017 Wiz vs Celtics. Height of Beal + Wall. The game that got me watching basketball  3) Blazers vs Nuggets immediately following the Thunder series. Specifically the 3OT game and then Game 7  4) 2018 Finals Game 1. All-time Lebron game vs pre-injury Warriors when their brand of basketball was beautiful to watch. Capped by LeBron yelling at high(?) JR Smith.   5) Game 1 Bubble first Round. Donovan Mitchell nearly had 60 against the Nuggets. Series went to 7 and really solidified Mitchell as one of my favorite players and a future multi-time All Star.   Bonus: Rockets game 7 Bubble vs the Thunder. The Harden block. Lu Dort hype at its zenith. Awesome stuff
"Reminder to everyone saying Donovan Mitchell is the next DWade, or DWade2.0, if we're following the same timelines, Mitchell would've won FMVP last year averaging 35ppg."
What if Donovan Mitchell is the next Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker is the next Devin Booker ü§Ø
"&gt;In no order. Off the top of my head. Paul george, Kawhi, Lebron, Anthony davis, Lillard, Zion, Luka, Donovan Mitchell, CP3, Devin Booker, Jokic, Embiid, KD, Harden, Giannis, Jimmy Butler, Beal, Steph Curry, Klay, Jayson Tatum, Kyrie.    &gt;The maybes... KAT, Ja Morant, Rudy Gobert, Westbrook. Probably more but i think I've made my point.  &gt; &gt;22 that are better and more then i couple that are debatable.  You are out of your mind on a lot of those.   In no particular order:   1) kyrie - this dude has done fuck all but get injured and be a cancer ever since Cleveland. This dude is whatever the opposite of a leader is. Kyrie absolutely shit the bed with a far better Celtics roster than what the hawks have.   2) Klay hasn't played in two years now. He's also not better than Trae young. Klay is a great supporting player, but he's not the type of player than can carry a team like Trae young has.   3) Westbrook? That one is absolutely laughable. While I have my disagreements with some of these players, Westbrook is clearly not as good as Trae young at this point in his career. How many times does Westbrook have to blow a close game for you to see this?  4) Ja Morant hasn't done anything to really show that he's on traes level. He's a good player. But he still can't shoot and it hinders his game.   5) There is no way in hell Rudy gobert is a better player than Trae young.   6) I wouldn't take Jimmy Butler over Trae Young. This hawks team is a worse roster than Miami had a year ago. And Jimmy Butler had a pretty forgettable year tbh. Maybe he bounces back next year.   7) CP3 is probably a wash at best. At his best he's better than Trae, but he can't carry a team like Trae can due to years of injuries and milage. Pick your poison. I'd take Paul in a single game, but Trae for an entire year  8) Tatum is debatable at best. I would say they are on the same tier. Same with Paul George."
"In no order. Off the top of my head.

Donovan Mitchell (when healthy) is a proven fucking killer in the playoffs.   Love Shai but it's Spida right now
Donovan mitchell. His shot selection is not good and too many times has tunnel vision.
This is Donovan Mitchell not Marcus Smart /s
and AD and Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley and Will Barton and a Michael Porter Jr and CP3 in round 1‚Ä¶ who am I missing?
"Stephen A's takes in the last week or so have made me wanna throw shit at him. First, Donovan Mitchell &gt; Karl Malone, now Devin booker is the next Kobe"
This is revenge for Donovan Mitchell
"Yeah, they probably should have had different (not injured) players in when the Jazz were starting to let them drive past them. Donovan and Conley just couldn't stay in front of their guards.   I think even Oni and Niang would have been an upgrade defensively over injured Mitchell and Conley. Offensively, no, but defensively definitely. Oh well."
Almost until I heard his podcast today and said these things:  1.	Celtics won the trade with OKC.  2.	Donovan Mitchell is tough like his brother. Donovan Mitchell doesn‚Äôt have a brother. 3.	He picked Atlanta to beat New York. As it he didn‚Äôt spend 30 minutes saying how Randle was going to wipe the floor with Atlanta.
"It‚Äôs tough because Royce, Mitchell, and Conley are all 6‚Äô4‚Äù and under while the closing lineup for Phoenix yesterday has book ad the pg at 6‚Äô5‚Äù and everyone else was taller. I think the jazz can be really successful with Donovan and gobert but the middle of the roster needs a shakeup"
"Booker has only played 1 game against the clippers, do you not understand sample size? Luka hasn‚Äôt played anyone but the clippers in the playoffs so you have nothing of substance to compare to, and Donovan Mitchell only averaged more points cuz he played significantly more minutes, accounting for that he would‚Äôve had better numbers against the Grizzlies if the games were closer"
Remember when there was debate about whether Donovan Mitchell or Ben Simmons was a better player?   Yeah that debate is clearly over
Donovan Mitchell is an informant for Vladimir Putin.
"Ja Morant, Donovan Mitchell, Tatum and possibly Zion to add to the list.  I'm not saying they will BE allstars but they have the potential."
"\&gt; Neither Luka, Donovan, or Booker are 35-10-10 guys in terms of what you‚Äôd expect their production to be on a standard basis.  But all of them are capable of it. Playoffs aren't a 'standard basis' -- these guys went all out. For Booker, he's also playing without CP3 and is the floor general resulting in more usage. We're talking about a guy who dropped 70 pts in a game.  Clippers obviously have some things to work out, but not sure what you've been watching. All three of those guys had/have been hitting shot after shot with a high degree of difficulty.  You might say Booker and Mitchell aren't superstars, which is a fair yet subjective label, but they certainly are capable of putting on superstar performances on any given night. I think Booker has been underrated for a while.  He's been waiting for this opportunity and finally gets to show it on the big stage."
Donovan Mitchell off the bench just to be safe.
"Neither Luka, Donovan, or Booker are 35-10-10 guys in terms of what you‚Äôd expect their production to be on a standard basis.   Unless you‚Äôre truly one of the best of your generation, a great defense doesn‚Äôt have to choose between 50-2-3 or 20-10-15. Look at what the Lakers did to Harden, Lillard, Murray last year.  No respectable defense is giving up 35 ppg on 60% TS from Donovan Mitchell"
"I don‚Äôt think he is that close *right now* to one of those four guys, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a stretch for one to see him potentially being one of those guys. I think this playoffs was obviously not a great look for him, but we‚Äôve seen him better than this and I still like his potential. A one-two combo where is is a point forward in tangent with a guy like Donovan Mitchell or Lillard seems pretty dangerous if he evolves his game a bit"
"""Which rookie year?"" -Donovan Mitchell, probably, while looking for his missing effing ROTY trophy"
The only award he'll ever win belongs to Donovan Mitchell
I‚Äôd drive Simmons to the airport for Donovan Mitchell.
"Lol, but why keep picks when you do stuff like pick Dennis Smith Jr when Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, John Collins and OG Anunoby are all still on the board?"
"Regular season will easily tell you who's good and who's not. The playoffs will only showcase this even more. However, the playoffs shows us who out of those good players are cut out for the biggest moments against the best of the best. Some guys like Donovan Mitchell step up more in the playoffs (statistically) compared to regular season. That's why we always have ""playoff rondo,"" ""playoff cp3,"" etc. But some guys fall apart *cough* *cough* Ben Simmons *cough*"
I'm not sure who you can trade Simmons for. Donovan Mitchell? Porzingas? Jamal Murray? It's gonna be tough to find an even trade. Sixers are gonna have a tough off season. I only throw Mitchell in there because the Jazz are gonna have an equally tough off season.
"Why are people saying Mitchell was injured? A lot of guys are banged up but play through it in the playoffs. Donovan was dropping 30+ regularly, he didn‚Äôt look super injured."
"Jaylen brown, taTum, Middleton, lavine, butler, hayward,klay, demar, Donovan Mitchell, Jamal murray, cj mcollum Are all better than him easily. Powell, Anthony Edwards, hield, mikal bridges, etc are arguably better."
Remember when he was better than Donovan Mitchell? That didn‚Äôt age well.
Remember when there was a debate whether Ben Simmons or Donovan Mitchell was the better player?  Lol.  Yeah that actually happened.
"For me it‚Äôs the playmaking. You see how Book can get Ayton and Mikal set up even when CP3 is out. Donovan Mitchell, as great as he is, just isn‚Äôt able to do the same for his team. Playmaking is really important for a perimeter star because sometimes, shots won‚Äôt fall, and you‚Äôll need to elevate your teammates."
"I‚Äôm a Jazz fan on the Suns bandwagon, I love Donovan so much but Booker has been the more efficient scorer and the better midrange shooter. Mitchell‚Äôs three point prowess especially in the playoffs is really amazing but if you can‚Äôt get hot from midrange (which Mitchell *can* but not like Booker) then you lose out on a majorly important tool"
Say my Wiz happened to get top pick every season for 5 straight seasons and having the hindsight of how players turn out‚Ä¶  C: James Wiseman (2020)  PF: Zion Williamson (2019)  SF: Brandon Ingram (2016)  SG: Donovan Mitchell (2017)  PG: Luka Doncic (2018)  Cause looking at what Ernie did to the team‚Ä¶it hurts too much to think on all the Players we missed due to horrible drafting.
Unrelated question but is Donovan Mitchell playing? I want him to recreate the dunk of death vs Gobert
"Doing it by year:   2016: no one 2017: Donovan Mitchell 2018: SGA, Miles or Mikal Bridges, MPJ and 2nd round Mitch Rob or Gary Trent Jr 2019: RJ Barrett 2020: Tyrese Haliburton, Quickley"
"Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell or Bam Adebayo, Pascal Siakam or Macolm Brogdon then we didn't have picks 2 years because of bad trades."
"SGA  Donovan Mitchell  RJ Barrett  Porzing*s  Mitchell Robinson  But obviously if we drafted SGA and/or Mitchell we wouldn't have been bad enough to draft Barrett, so this would have never happened"
"The thing is this. Luka and Trae are better than their entire draft class and will be better than a bunch of other guys in the league. I'd put them a tier above Donovan Mitchell, Jamal Murray, De'Aaron Fox, maybe Devin Booker (we'll see) for sure. These guys are gonna be the next LeBron/KD/Harden/Steph/Kawhi of our era."
How he won ROY even after being in the league a year (injured doesn‚Äôt matter) is beyond me.. Donovan Mitchell was robbed.
Bruh take it back further. Can we give Donovan Mitchell RoY still?
The fact that Donovan Mitchell wasn't the 2018 ROY and Ben Simmons was is still astounding to me.
Its kinda crazy how Ben Simmons took Rookie of the year away from Donovan Mitchell. Ben Simmons also the all-NBA nod to give contract more money while Donovan Mitchell missed out on that kicker since he didn't get any All-NBA nod.
I‚Äôd rather have Donovan Mitchell on one leg than Simmons fully healthy.
Ben Simmons or Donovan Mitchell who would you rather have now after four seasons and four playoff performances?
"Chris Paul at PG, Donovan Mitchell at SG.  Then you got PG at SF, Lebron at PF, and AD at C?  If you count Davis as a first name"
Or Donovan Mitchell
Donovan Mitchell: ‚ÄúIT NEVER WAS‚Äù
Anyone remember Simmons being cocky and condescending to being compared to Donovan Mitchell?
Well at least Ben Simmons won a well deserved Rookie of the Year over Donovan Mitchell.
Just a reminder that Ben Simmons won Rookie of the Year over Donovan Mitchell.
Or when he won ROY over Donovan Mitchell and Tatum lol.
Ben Simmons needs to give his ROTY trophy to Donovan Mitchell
This mans better than Donovan Mitchell tho right sixers fans?
#RETROACTIVELY GIVE THAT ROOKIE OF THE YEAR TO DONOVAN MITCHELL
"???? But he is. Too bad donovan mitchell and mike conley were a turnstile on defense. The Clippers got penetration every posession, then when Gobert has to slide down they have a wide open 3 every time."
Embiid gotta do everything. . .     Maybe him and Donovan Mitchell should team up. Add Dame in there too.
"Never seen maxey play before this series, but he reminds me of rookie Donovan Mitchell."
"and hes playin defense  but nephews like you don‚Äôt understand how defense works and thinks it‚Äôs his fault when terence mann hits a 3, not realizing that gobert had to provide help defense because donovan mitchell is a fucking traffic cone on the perimeter  miracle that gobert drags those dudes to being an elite regular season defense. testament to his greatness"
that is clearly donovan mitchell  almost every mann three he coulda rotated over to defend him in the corner when gobert went to protect the paint but he just left him wide open
"Donovan Mitchell by far the weak link of their defense, dude is atrocious on D."
"I feel bad for Donovan Mitchell. He was cooking before his injury like Booker was tonight.  Maybe it wouldn't have mattered in their series, but I think it would've been a lot closer."
"Apparently, the Pistons was down to between Stanley Johnson and Devin Booker and it was split 50/50 between the FO and coaching staff. Obviously, they took Stanley but Booker would've been a great fit for the Pistons since he's from Michigan and was born and raised in Grand Rapids.   They also had the opportunity to take Donovan Mitchell over Luke Kennard but chose Kennard over him. That's two potential superstar picks that the Pistons missed out on big time"
I KNOW Donovan Mitchell is mad after looking  at Terance Mann's statline this game üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"All-star sub. No All-nba.   Donovan Mitchell/Zach Lavine better.   You're all nephews."
All-star sub. No All-nba.   Donovan Mitchell/Zach Lavine better.   You're all nephews.
"I pay attention to international basketball and international competitions. That's why I know that this USA roster is already much better than that year's American roster. Americans that led in minutes in that game: Kemba, Harrison Barnes, Donovan Mitchell, Myles Turner, Khris Middleton."
"Having just come off the Jazz series, Donovan Mitchell scares me more"
Imagine thinking Donovan Mitchell is in the same class as Booker.
Devin Booker is about to take the Luka Doncic/Donovan Mitchell role of making ridiculous shots over the Clippers.
Aren‚Äôt you the guy who made a post complaining that Donovan Mitchell didn‚Äôt receive any MVP votes?
How many of his points are from the line? Stop acting like he‚Äôs not chucking. Donovan Mitchell got shit all season for shooting a better percentage than what trae is shooting in this series
"Yeah Donovan Mitchell was really hurting inside, but still stuck around to congratulate the clippers"
"He gets paid 200 million dollars for defense. Literally that is what the entire league values him for. He is supposedly the most valuable defender the league has. We all know he‚Äôs absolute dogshit offensively. So if he‚Äôs getting paid 200 million dollars, I don‚Äôt really think you can blame the lackluster defense on anybody but him. When you pay somebody 200 million dollars solely for defense, you better be expecting this guy to single handedly carry your team on that end because obviously your budget is going to be lower for the others. So I‚Äôm not going to blame Donovan or Ingles because it‚Äôs on Gobert to defend considering he is the primary reason supposedly for the Jazz being the best defense in the NBA. Yet, despite that, the Jazz played like a below average one against the Clippers.  Again, you keep blaming others. But Joe Ingles does not get paid anything near Gobert and his worth is deemed by his shooting, not his defense. Mitchell has never been a particularly good defender either. Gobert is the so called DPOTY. He‚Äôs the 200 million dollar man. He‚Äôs supposedly the greatest defender the NBA has ever seen if you look at aNaLyTiCs, so if there‚Äôs shitty perimeter defense going on, he should be able to cover for those mistakes. It‚Äôs not like their perimeter defense even got that much worse. The only downgrade was Mitchell and he never has been a good defender anyway.   You keep blaming everybody else but Gobert is the reason the Jazz will never win anything. This team has sunk all their money on an immobile and useless on offense big man that can only be played one way. The rockets in earlier seasons abused him in the exact same way the clippers did this series. Gobert turns into a mental midget on drop defense coverage schemes."
Naw u a troll cause apparently you dont see a gap between KD and Donovan Mitchell. You really dont think KD is better than DMitch? You think most people only see KD as better cause his reputation and time in the league? KD may not be the best but he is easily one of the top 5 players in the world.
"Do you think Jokic and Donovan Mitchell get marketed like huge draws though? I‚Äôm not expecting them to get coverage and marketing like KD and LeBron cause they aren‚Äôt at that level but it seems like there is a gigantic drop off between 6 players and the rest of the league. Jokic was the MVP. Now compare him to any other player who wins MVP in their league, they are probably the most talked about player that one year or among them. NJ was only talked about to undermine his accomplishment and I can‚Äôt remember Donovan getting talked about during the regular season besides pundits questioning if the Jazz were a fluke."
Any NBA player the had more speed and agility than Rudy G. T Mann is not some unstoppable force you just can‚Äôt let him have wide open 3s and easy layups to the point a second year player in the biggest game of their life drops 39 points. T Mann is nowhere near the offensive player as Donovan Mitchell and he has the same amount of points‚Ä¶. Not a great defense scheme if you ask me. But Your right‚Ä¶ keep playing Rudy G‚Ä¶ Worked out great for them. The clippers willingness to make adjustments and not go with a slow footed big man like Zubac is the reason why the turned the DPOY into a defensive liability. IDK seemed like a good coaching choice. But I guess it‚Äôs better to stick to your guns and lose 4 in a row than try something different.
We have a debate in my group chat.  Without giving much details one of the members is of the opinion that Kevin Durant and Donovan Mitchell are overrated.  What is the general consensus here?
"Without Cp3, bookers going to have to go Donovan Mitchell on the Clippers. How‚Äôd that end up?"
"Curry is a terrible defender ask Kyrie in the finals , there‚Äôs a reason Klay would guard the best guard because curry is a liability on defense. The west was much weaker this season with all the injuries , Donovan Mitchell , Jamal Murray, PorzinGod , Lebron, Anthony Davis. Curry is better than Lillard yes but his numbers will see a big decline when Klay is back m. He‚Äôs not the mvp point blank period ."
"I think it depends on Donovan Mitchell. But as you just saw tonight, in an intense game where Curry went off, Davis and LeBron struggled, and the Warrior just couldn't pull it off."
Are they gonna drop this one to face the jazz? A rusty donovan mitchell is much better than a full strength suns. Plus they wanna be on the record be the 8th seed to beat a 1st seed
earlier i was told that donovan mitchell was a superstar
"Oubre, Ja, Claxton, Nerlens Noel, Romeo Langford, DLo, Jordan Clarkson, Jamal Murray, Weley Matthews, Curry, James Wiseman Aaron Gordon, Fox, CP3, Lowry, Justise Winslow, Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, PG13, Anfernee Simmons, Melo, there's a lot of cute guys"
Stupid sexy Donovan Mitchell üò©
&gt;[UTA] Donovan Mitchell
&gt;[UTA] Donovan Mitchell
"Good on the Jazz because they're doing something they don't have to do, but I always feel really weird about performance related charity. Especially charity of the life changing kind. The idea of hoping that Donovan Mitchell goes for 50 for me to be able to to to school feels so dystopian."
Id rather have Moe Wagner and Donovan Mitchell than get the bootleg versions yall are talking about.
Donovan Mitchell shot 34% as a rookie on 7 threes a game. He's now a 38-39% three point shooter.
"Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, and Jayson Tatum probably won't even make All-NBA this year, so I'm going to say there are at least 20-25 guys in the NBA who you can build around.  They're not all top-7 guaranteed playoff run guys, but they're building blocks."
Draymond is not better than Donovan Mitchell FOH
Donovan Mitchell
"True the top guys have not played as well as they can and it is on them to perform. Green and curry are much more limited than what I was thinking, nobody is scared of a Seth curry pick and roll. I just think this team would be insanely hard to stop if you replaced Tobias Harris‚Äôs salary slotwith a guy like Chris Paul, Donovan Mitchell, Jamal Murray, maybe even Kemba walker or Jrue holiday etc..   obviously that‚Äôs true cause most of those guys are all better than Harris but also cause every other high level playoff offense we‚Äôve seen has somebody who is a legitimately good perimeter creator and the sixers have the least perimeter creation of any contender and I think that imbalance is largely cause they gave all that money to Harris. It‚Äôs also bad because every team has to play big against embiid and the sixers do a terrible job of taking advantage of slow bigs by forcing them to play in space because their guards are so limited"
Maybe on the Jazz? A Donovan Mitchell/Bradley Beal tandem would be scary.
"I think they match up fairly well against both teams, but I'll save Utah for these reasons         1. Donovan Mitchell is going to be rusty missing all that time     2. Rudy Gobert is going to have a lot to deal with with the Lakers bigs         3. History, this is more of a LeBron thing but imagine if they get the 8th seed and get to the finals and maybe win a championship as the 8th seed, mother fuckers are going to have to avoid ESPN and FS1 for at least 3 months ü§£"
The Jazz. Donovan Mitchell should be rusty coming back from injury
"Literally untrue.   KD and Lebron have gotten 18 free throws in a playoff game in 2011 and 2012. Harden shot 24 free throws in a regular season game in 2019 and 18 in two different playoff games in 2017. Kawhi and Butler both shot 19 in 2017 and Mitchell and Butler literally shot the same number in a playoff game last year. The only thing you‚Äôre right about is that Giannis has only gotten 16 and not 17 Lebron:   In 2017, Butler and Kawhi both got got 19 in a playoff game while Harden got 18 in two different ones. Donovan Mitchell and Butler got 17 last  year. KD and Lebron had 18 in 2011 and 2012.  it in 202"
Meanwhile Donovan Mitchell dropped an easy 33 because Russell Worstbrook was obsessed with chasing a playmaker instead of the most dangerous scorer on the court
"Full list of everyone who qualifies for these filters (i.e. everyone who has made more than 50 pull-up threes since the ASB):  Steph Curry - 93/229 (40.6%)  Damian Lillard - 95/245 (38.8%)  Anthony Edwards - 55/142 (38.7%)  Buddy Hield - 53/139 (38.1%)  Jayson Tatum - 65/178 (36.5%)  Luka Doncic - 90/262 (34.4%)  CJ McCollum - 59/175 (33.7%)  Lowering the threshold to 40 adds Jrue Holiday (43/103, 41.7%), Joe Ingles (47/119, 39.5%), Donovan Mitchell (50/129, 38.8%), Zach LaVine (48/137, 35.0%), Kemba Walker (42/126, 33.3%), and Jordan Clarkson (49/175, 28.0%)."
"&gt; Randle was nowhere near bust status or having is NBA career in jeopardy, many Lakers fans wanted to keep him.  That is part of my point. Even he doesn't fit. Pretty much no one does.  &gt;It's an interesting point you make but players mocked that high don't constantly fail as hard as the Suns did even if it takes them going to another team.  But if it was because of the Suns failure to develop them, other teams should find tons of value swooping and picking up these young guys with star potential. Turns out they are pretty nonfactor on their teams no matter where they go and not anywhere close to being a star that many predicted before the Suns drafted them.  &gt;The Suns didn't reach but these guys failed spectacularly, there must be something the Suns were doing wrong in terms of player development that made them irredeemable.  If you got a coin and flip it 10 times it wont likely alternate heads then tails everytime. You are likely get a string of heads and/or a string of tails. It is a crapshoot. The Utah Jazz picked Kanter, Alec Burks, Trey Burke, Dante Exum, Trey Lyles to Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell. This is also true accross sports, Seahawks had a string of historically great draft classes in the early 2010's to pretty bad recently in comparison. It often takes 1 or 2 players to chance an entire narrative of draft history and if 76ers never got Embiid, if Bucks never got Giannis, and if Kings got Doncic instead of Bagley, it would change entire prespectives."
This is Donovan Mitchell vs Ben Simmons all over again
"Oh my fault, yeah I agree, that one series Cp3 outplayed Harden. Also helps Donovan Mitchell shot something like 30% if i‚Äôm not mistaken, Utah had no chance."
Yeah and Donovan Mitchell was pretty rusty in the bubble after a long break last year
"i think having rusty donovan mitchell is a lot better than no donovan mitchell  mitchell scored 26.5ppg this year and is the best player the jazz have in the ""welp we got nothing, go ahead and figure this shit out donovan""* plays. the 10 possessions he eats per game where the jazz just shrug their shoulders and say ""go for it don"" are very important to the jazz  *clarkson is 2nd best at this, but its good to have 2 of them for the starting and bench units"
"The Nuggets werent healthy, Donovan Mitchell had what will be the greatest series of his entire career by a mile and you still lost anyway to the team that got obliterated by the Lakers, just stop it.  &gt; The Jazz win in 5 if Harris didn't come back from injury and swing the series because of his perimeter defense.  Ah yes, a player that cameback in Game 6 stopped your team from winning the series in 5, that makes sense. Harris might be the most important player to ever average 4 points on 15% shooting then."
"I'm sure plenty of players prioritize their own points over winning. Lots of players probably end up hurting their teams ability to win games by focusing on themselves and playing hero ball. This is not something unique to Russell Westbrook or Donovan Mitchell. Look, you have taken Russell Westbrook's triple doubles and determined that they are great and that his motives are pure. That is fine. I just look at them differently than you do. Of course it's and impressive feat and Russell Westbrook is a very good basketball player, but when I put it into context and think about it, it looks more like stat padding and I think it sometimes can be counter productive."
"Because it‚Äôs stupid to psychoanalyze players when we have no idea what‚Äôs going on other than what we see on the court. By your logic it‚Äôs equally legitimate to say that Donovan Mitchell is prioritizing his own points per game average over winning. It‚Äôs a fact too, because the Jazz winning percentage is .684 without Mitchell this year (good for 2nd in the West). He‚Äôs really just trying to get his own numbers and has a minimal impact (if any) on team success."
"I think so, there are less iso's and more jump shooting  Even look at a young player like Donovan Mitchell. He was a dunk machine in his rookie season, but he has since reigned that in to take more 3's/open shots."
Joe Harris won the 3-point shooting title this year with a .475% and congrats to him. I dont mean to take anything away from Joe Harris as he is an incredible shooter and deserves all the praise he receives. Joe Ingles had quite the season in comparison.   **Joe Ingles -**  33 years old  Minutes played = 1867  3 Point % = .451  3‚Äôs attempted = 406  3‚Äôs made = 183 total (2.3 per game)  &amp;#x200B;  **Joe Harris -**  29 years old  Minutes played = 2141  3 Point % = .475  3‚Äôs Attempted = 444  3‚Äôs Made = 211 total (3.1 per game)  &amp;#x200B;  Not bad for an undrafted player who was waived by the Clippers in 2014. The Utah Jazz gave him a chance and the rest is history.  I also found this interesting..  &amp;#x200B;  **Utah Jazz All-Time 3-Pointers Made Leaders:**  &amp;#x200B;  1- Joe Ingles ‚Äì 993 (7 Seasons)  2- John Stockton ‚Äì 845 (19 Seasons)  3- Donovan Mitchell ‚Äì 726 (4 Seasons)
Cause Donovan Mitchell didn‚Äôt shit his pants over it
"I am a twolves fan so I'm gonna get downvoted for being biased, but I gotta say my piece.   Until about March, I thought Lamelo was ROY and it wasn't even close. But the way Ant has played this spring has completely changed my mind, especially now that Ball has returned and had a lackluster end to the season, compared to how shit hot he was before he got hurt.   Ant has been completely dominant the second half of the season. For how impressive Ball's first half was, I think Ant's was even more impressive. Post-ASB, he averaged 23-5-4 on league-average efficiency. He's been putting up Donovan Mitchell-like numbers for *half the season*.  He's gotten better every month the last four month, finishing the month of May averaging 27-5-5 on 52-40-79 splits (or something like that, I'm doing it off of memory). Those are fucking insane stats, for anybody. To add to all that, post-ASB, Ant was THIRD in the league behind only Steph and Dame for pull-up 3pt percentage (min &gt; 50 3PM). He's gotten so much more efficient, and he's still not even going to the line a lot.   He's been a huge contributing factor to why the Wolves have won so many games post-ASB. These aren't garbage time numbers or numbers he putting up in nightly blow outs. He's able to put the team on his back and will them to a win (see: Portland and Phoenix wins in March), or at least into being competitive (see: Memphis two weeks ago). He's also made strides in terms of playmaking ability, ability to get rebounds, and defense, although his defense still needs a ton of work.   I can't take anything away from Ball. He's been incredible, and he's gonna be a superstar. But Ant took his game to a completely different level this spring. He could be a scoring champion contender by the time he's 24-25."
This proves that Donovan Mitchell and Gobert are superstars. The best defender in the league is a star. The best player on the best team is a star. Hell Clarkson is a star relative 6 men. Not a super star sure. But he's the best at an important role and that deserves respect. The team is good. When healthy they proved they can beat anyone. When not healthy still could too
Is Donovan Mitchell back yet?
"The Jazz are solid.....when they‚Äôre not facing star players every night (yay regular season!). Whatever stats you have for me can get thrown out, bc this is when you DO face Lebron/Kawhi/Durant/whoever every night. Donovan Mitchell is good, but he‚Äôs not THOSE guys."
"The 4 seeded Clippers might have something to say about that.....  Also, what‚Äôs the deal with Donovan Mitchell? Is he coming back? Bc you guys definitely don‚Äôt go far without him."
Donovan Mitchell played 1 more game than Jimmy this year...
"They aren't sleeping on small market teams, they are in a coma to a team without a single Top 15 player in the league.  People love to look hipster on this sub, but if Utah plays the Lakers in the first round (which is very possible) i would bet money that 90% of this sub wouldn't bet against AD and LeBron.  Depth is vastly overrated when it comes to the playoffs, most of the time the team that wins is the one with the Top 2-3 players in a series. Let's not act like we haven't seen Utah in the playoffs 8 months ago and that it didn't take Donovan Mitchell averaging 36/5/5 on 69% TS for them to push Denver to 7 games, the same Denver squad that got embarassed by the Lakers in 5 games and barely survived a choking Clippers.  Utah is way more likely to get bounced in the first two rounds than they are to get to the WCF and this isn't the case very often for a No.1 seed. If the Lakers win on Wednesday they get a playoff series win, if the Lakers lose they are going home after six games."
We definitely didn't have a Donovan Mitchell on the '15 Hawks but I don't think a Donovan Mitchell would have gotten us by 2015 Playoff Lebron.  It might be enough to get by 2021 Busted Ankle Lebron if the Lakers end up the 8th seed.
"Zion was an incredible offensive force this year and snubbed by PG, and Lebron who only played 45 games...  Love Jimmy but he didn't have a better year than Donovan Mitchell."
Donovan Mitchell would be proud
Y'all really sleeping on Donovan Mitchell in this comments section.   I peg if his ankle is good for the playoffs he's someone you dont want to bet against. He's top 5 of players under 25 IMO.  Everyone likes to bring up '15 hawks but that team did not have talent close to what Spida is.
No team led by donovan mitchell and rudy gobert will ever be contenders.
you guys should have gotten to the wcf last year if donovan mitchell didn't lay down during the final play like a fucking idiot
"It‚Äôs so funny that people actually think they have a realistic shot. Imagine an NBA team with Donovan Mitchell or Gobert as the best player winning the championship in the same league as LeBron, KD, Kawhi, Giannis, etc. lmfao not happening"
When is Donovan Mitchell coming back?
Jazz don‚Äôt have a Jokic and Donovan Mitchell will never play as good as he did in the bubble again
"Back to earth? Wow, the deliberate ignorance of some people is astounding. They‚Äôve been the best team almost the entire year, have #1 in point differential by a mile, are #5 offensive rating, #3 defensive rating, #3 in record above .500 teams, the 3x DPOY (and all nba), 6th man of the year, and a very determined Donovan Mitchell. The WCF are their basement and I can‚Äôt wait until they are in finals and. Still reading ‚Äúthey aren‚Äôt good enough.‚Äù"
Lmfao I played with celebrity children.... who cares who I played with or if you believe me. I‚Äôve won and lost games that aren‚Äôt worth more than a memory. Who cares. I‚Äôve met like 3-4 NBA star players. They were giants in person. My fucking brother played against Donovan Mitchell. (In the private school league) Who cares. My brother couldn‚Äôt make it to college for ball. Most people can‚Äôt. You race cars. Why does your opinion matter?
"Tons of guys deserve spots who won‚Äôt get it this year, the guard position is stacked. Donovan Mitchell who‚Äôs one of the best players on the best team in the league has a solid chance to not make all-nba."
"&gt;The Jazz have the best record in the NBA and Donovan Mitchell is their leader.  No. Gobert is their leader.   &gt;26ppg is greater than Jimmy/PG  21/7/7 on 60%TS(Jimmy) is better than 26/4/5 on 57%TS   23/6/5 on 60%TS for PG  Taking more shots to score more points doesn't make you a better player. In fact, with Jazz's great shooters, Mitchell is hurting the team with the shots he take. For example, Conley has a True shooting of 59%, Mitchell taking those shots instead of him hurts their offense.   &gt;Kyrie is barely over .500 in games he plays without James Harden  What's Mitchell's record without Gobert?"
Didn't he also assist a player (Donovan Mitchell?) In a dunk contest?
The Jazz have the best record in the NBA and Donovan Mitchell is their leader. 26ppg is greater than Jimmy/PG and Kyrie is barely over .500 in games he plays without James Harden.
"&gt;G: Donovan Mitchell  What's the argument for Mitchell over Kawhi, PG, Jimmy, CP3, Kyrie?"
"Why does the first half matter more than the 2nd half? 90% of rookies werent good the first half and even then Edwards was still only worse than Haliburton and Lamelo then. Now he is averaging Donovan Mitchell numbers the last 45 games, im giving it to Edwards."
"It helps you avoid a bad match up in the seedings.  Denver couldn't beat Houston, so they wanted to make them the 4th seed by losing a game to Portland to let the Blazers hopefully get the 3rd seed.  It worked. [Despite nearly a million-to-one odds against](https://www.slcdunk.com/the-downbeat-latest-jazz-news/2019/4/11/18306235/nba-utah-jazz-houston-rockets-fate-playoffs-donovan-mitchell-james-harden-2019)"
"Have you paid attention to the western conference the last decade?? The 7 seed in the west‚Äî-by a few game‚Äî-more than deserves a playoff spot. They played 82(72) games for it.   Forget that ‚Äòif you can‚Äôt win 2 games‚Äô nonsense that‚Äôs irrelevant. Not to mention injuries happen. If it was a small market team fighting for the spot , like say Utah, with an injured Donovan Mitchell, people would have more sympathy"
"For the last 5 years Definitely remembered: LeBron, Curry, Giannis, Durant, Klay, Davis, Lillard, Harden, Russ, CP3, Embiid, Kyrie, Wade, Kobe  Likely remembered: Jokic, Tatum, Korver, Griffin, Derrick Rose, Donovan Mitchell  Potentially forgotten: Jimmy Butler, Kemba, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Bradley Beal, Al Horford, Devin Booker  Likely forgotten: Lowry, Aldridge, Millsap, Kevin Love, Marc Gasol, Bosh, DeMar DeRozan, John Wall, Ben Simmons, Mike Conley, Rudy Gobert"
"He's so bad he's ranked right behind Donovan Mitchell, buddy hield, and Julius randle. Bunch of scrubs."
GONNA BE HONEST. RUDY GOBERT IS THE MOST ELITE PLAYOFF FORCE OF ALL TIME. DONOVAN MITCHELL IS QUITE LITERALLY BETTER THAN KEVIN DURANT. IT‚ÄôS NOT EVEN BECAUSE DONOVAN IS THAT GOOD. KEVIN DURANT IS JUST AN AWFUL PLAYER. UHHHH WHAT ELSE... FUCK YALL
We beat the jazz HANDILY 4-0 during that regular season. We certainly didn't expect Donovan Mitchell to go ballistic.
"Yeah he's got this weird thing where he almost acts like he has to defend the reputations of very well regarded players by inflating their greatness. During the Suns-Jazz game a couple months ago he was talking about Donovan Mitchell and he was like ""he should *absolutely* be in the MVP discussion."" Like it was some affront to his honor that he wasn't."
"Luka Doncic, Donovan Mitchell, Luol Deng, Jayson Tatum and Rudy Gobert for the 2 or fewer allstar appearance players."
"Plus, playoff series are sometimes won and lost on the on the injured list. Let's say hypothetically Donovan Mitchell ankle isn't really right. That doesn't get better over the course of a seven game series, it gets more likely that he gets reinjured. Same for LeBron, for AD, Ibaka, Conley, Ayton, whoever. Better to get the rest you can now in the regular season but I wouldn't be surprised if at least one of those guys listed doesn't end up playing 3 playoff games."
"Cause he is. It's not just height. It's weight, wingspan and frame. Eric Bledsoe is shorter than Curry, have you ever heard anyone call him little? The same with Donovan Mitchell. Those guys have a bigger frame and wingspan. Mitchell walks around like 215-220 as a 6ft guard with a near 7 ft wingspan and wears size 17 shoes."
So what you're saying is   1. Donovan Mitchell  2. LeBron James  3. Michael Jordan
"If you want some perspective on how underwhelming and unimpressive LeBron's rings are, just realize you could replace him with 24 year old Donovan Mitchell and you'd still end up with 4 rings.  Heat win 2012 and 2013 still and also 2011. Lakers still win with bubble Mitchell instead of LeBron because of their cakewalk path to that ring."
Donovan Mitchell is too good
I want Donovan Mitchell on my team. The effort never leaves. Catching LAs stars lacking.

Donovan Mitchell is the best basketball player on the court.
"I don't know who is having a better game tonight, Donovan Mitchell or Doris Burke"
Lmao at Donovan Mitchell out scoring kawhi and Paul George combined for 2 games straight.    You absolutely cannot let this happen if you‚Äôre the clips. One of those 2 has to get going.

donovan mitchell is absolutely destroying the clippers
Donovan ‚ÄúNot a passer‚Äù Mitchell
"It's no fluke, Donovan Mitchell is amazing in the playoffs.  Bubble or not.  He's on that list of players in which something about the moment makes them better (I have Murray on that list also)."
Fuck just the other day I was arguing with like half the Jazz fanbase (~4 people) about how Donovan Mitchell isn‚Äôt a truly elite offensive player
They‚Äôd just be talking about how the clippers have altitude fatigue and how Donovan Mitchell can‚Äôt do this all series and how Leonard is going to wake up and Paul George will get out of his slump and how Gobert isn‚Äôt good at defending the 3 then they‚Äôd talk the rest of the time about the bucks. Then Charles would guarantee the jazz win and that would doom them to lose.
Donovan Mitchell is rawdogging the Clips.
Skip Bayless: Donovan Mitchell is about to go for 60 and make HIS case for Best Player on the Planet.  Finally a good take from him. Donovan Mitchell is just that good.
This series so far:  Donovan Mitchell: 72  Kawhi + Paul George: 66
Donovan Mitchell is a certified bad bad man
Imagine if Denver didn't trade Donovan Mitchell for Tyler Lydon and Trey Lyles.   Mitchell-Murray-Porter Jr-Gordon-Jokic
"sometimes donovan mitchell just wrecks their traps, doubles and hits crazy shots on top of that. Not much you can do. And the jazz has a more complete team. Clarkson and Ingles showing up!"
Donovan Mitchell is a superstar.

LMAO and people were tryna tell me Harden was better than Donovan Mitchell
No we have to show Donovan Mitchell on a foam roll stretching
Before our playoff series against OKC PG was talking about how we hadn‚Äôt seen Playoff P yet and then proceeded to get outplayed by a rookie Donovan Mitchell.  It was the birth of the Playoff P meme.
Donovan Mitchell is the most impressive player on the court today and he‚Äôs always the most impressive player behind the camera
I love watching Donovan Mitchell play basketball
"Donovan Mitchell is seriously underrated. He is absolutely insane. This might seem like a hot take, but he is going to end up top 30 all time."
Donovan Mitchell incredible player
"You watch kawhi and push off P, and they are constantly using their forearm to create their space.  Donovan Mitchell uses his skill. So refreshing"
donovan mitchell now that is a very nice young man right there
"Luke ""drafted before Donovan Mitchell"" Kennard with the three."
Donovan Mitchell is who PG thinks he is
Donovan Mitchell made Pat Bev look silly
Donovan Mitchell confirmed NOT a bubble boy

Great talents like Donovan Mitchell continue to be wasted on Utah... sad to see
"As a day 1 Donovan Mitchell Stan, this series has been amazing so far"
Donovan Mitchell since he lost in game 7 has been different different in the playoffs
Give me Ben Simmons v Donovan Mitchell in the finals
"It's funny thinking about it, Donovan Mitchell is the all-levels scorer Markelle Fultz was supposed to be"
I feel embarrassed for people who question whether Donovan Mitchell is a superstar. Quickest way to reveal you don‚Äôt actually watch basketball
Can anyone honestly say they'd rather have PG on their team than Donovan Mitchell?
Ty Lue has no answer for Donovan Mitchell.
Y‚Äôall clown Pg13 but no one can guard Donovan Mitchell when he‚Äôs hot like this.
Donovan Mitchell is special
Donovan Mitchell is currently on pace for 266~ points.

Donovan Mitchell is a superstar
Donovan Mitchell is one of the best playoff performers rn
Donovan Mitchell is amazing
Donovan Mitchell apparently
Donovan Fucking Mitchell
Donovan Mitchell is made for the playoffs.
Fun fact; Donovan Mitchell is a huge Ravens fan because of his ties with Lamar Jackson. That should be enough for the DMV fans to be supporting the Jazz
Donovan is so nasty. Plus the Jazz need to rebrand these colors as their primary. Amazing look and a fresh one for the Mitchell Era.
donovan mitchell is easily becoming a top 3 favorite player for me
I don't know how he's doing it. But Donovan Mitchell is cheating somehow.
Donovan Mitchell is so damn good oh my god
Nobody:   Donovan Mitchell:   #AND I TOOK IT PERSONALLY
I fucking love Donovan Mitchell
Donovan Mitchell is good at basketball
My mom just called and confessed that my real dad was Donovan Mitchell all along. The math doesn't add up but somehow I still know it's true
"""*It's too easy.*"" - Donovan Mitchell"
This sounds mean but if you‚Äôre a diehard Jazz fan and you decide to cop a Rudy Gobert jersey over a Donovan Mitchell there‚Äôs some mental issues there that need to be sorted out
"Watch Donovan Mitchell tonight, he‚Äôs almost as bad."
This Donovan Mitchell guy is pretty good
cant breathe on donovan mitchell tonight
DONOVAN MITCHELL WTF
Is Donovan Mitchell literally prime d wade?
Donovan Mitchell
"Donovan Mitchell looks so much better then anyone else on the floor right now, and it's not looking close.  Kawhi is doing some things but it's sporadic. He looks great in spurts, but Donovan is doing more in longer spurts."
LETS FUCKING GOOOO DONOVAN MITCHELL IS MY GOD EAT SHIT BITCHASS FANS TALKING SHIT EARLY I TOLD YALL
Damien Mitchell...Donovan Lillard?
I'm just here to root for donovan mitchell
These Donovan Mitchell bursts of insane scoring are incredible but the bad part is that they manage to deceive the idiots into thinking he's a legitimately elite offensive player
Donovan Mitchell is not a bubble boy
"If Donovan Mitchell goes off for the rest of the playoffs and wins Finals MVP, then we need to put him on at least the Dame/Luka/Giannis/Jokic/Embiid tier"
Donovan Mitchell is so freakin fun to watch
Donovan Mitchell is so fucking cool
Reminder the Blazers were set to draft Mitchell but Olshey took Zach Collins. Donovan even said Dame called him to tell him he's going to Portland at 11 for fuck sake Neil
Imagine you're the type of person that hates on Donovan Mitchell lol
Donovan Mitchell looking like a man possessed right now
"Donovan Mitchell needs more god damn respect on his name, crazy what he‚Äôs doing at his age"
Donovan Mitchell is a killer.
DOnovaN mItChElL Is oVeRrAtEd
Change my mind: Damian Lillard and Donovan Mitchell aren't good enough to be a number one option for a championship team
"don't worry. Rudy ""$200m, more valuable than Donovan Mitchell"" Gobert gonna wake up in the 2nd half"
I knew Mike Conley was out tonight but I didn't know Donovan Mitchell was gonna be missing too.
Donovan Mitchell looks like the protagonist of a coming of age high school movie.
"Yep looking at the game, like I mean Donovan Mitchell is great, but Luka is jsut on another level. Look at this Jazz team filled with great players, Luka was basically solo consistent one that played almost solo vs Clippers some games."
Why does Donovan Mitchell get a better whistle than Tatum????
Is Donovan Mitchell in foul trouble? Feels like he hasn‚Äôt played in forever.
"I was having a nice nap on my couch during the 1st quarter of the Jazz, Clippers game when I was suddenly awoken by gunshots on my television! I was confused at first but then I realized that the noise was just DONOVAN MITCHELL bricks bouncing off the rim! Keep it down SPIDA !"
"This is so disrespectful to those Rockets teams, they have someone like Harden who can mix it up, the Jazz has Donovan Mitchell."
Watching Donovan Mitchell in the driving seat of a team is painful. He‚Äôs nothing more than a good slasher. He shouldn‚Äôt be the one making the decisions.
Donovan Mitchell decisionmaking is happenning.
"Donovan Mitchell saw Luka's performance in the series and was like ""fuck it, I need to do this too."""
Classic Donovan Mitchell.
Donovan Mitchell had a higher points-per-36 through 6 games literally last year.
Just the 4 wide open looks for Donovan Mitchell so far
"Donovan ""lucky bounce"" Mitchell"
"As a Donovan Mitchell fan, I am very familiar with the idiocy of sixer fans"
"The same Kevin Durant who's averaging close to 6 assists a game the past few seasons?  The same Kevin Durant who has an assist% this year of 27.5%?  So the same level as kyrie, Donovan mitchell, giannis, and just a bit under steph.  Thats the guy who's 'lacking' in the playmaking department?  Look he's no chris Paul to be clear, but come on hes obviously an above average passer and playmaker.  I swear its like you've never even watched him play."
"It's Donovan Mitchell and I won't entertain any blasphemous arguments against this fact, AIGHT!"
They figured out how to execute it pretty damn well against the Mavs.  Granted Dallas doesn‚Äôt have your level of shooter but they also Luka who no one on Utah comes close to and they tired him out by the 4 quarter due to their switching.  I don‚Äôt think Donovan Mitchell can break that scheme when Luka couldn‚Äôt.  So then it is all on Rudy to make plays at the basket and that‚Äôs not exactly what Utah wants.  You guys want to take 40 plus threes.  It‚Äôs reasonable to suggest that the Clippers just let Rudy eat down low on short rolls to limit three point attempts.
"I'm genuinely asking this question, so don't flame me.   Hardens career 3 pt% is exactly the same as Donovan Mitchell. Nobody has ever said Donovan is an elite 3 pt shooter, on the contrary alot of people have said he was a chucker historically.   Harden does have a slightly higher 2pt % at 51.3, meanwhile Donovan is at 48.5.  I guess my question is, what makes Harden considered a perennial shooter when his percentages aren't all that much higher than a player very few consider a top 5 shooter?"
"Donovan Mitchell isn't in the First Team as of right now, but I suspect he has a big series and vaults himself into the first team.   Last year's playoffs seemed to really push his game, and more importantly his mentality, to a new level."
Yet Doncic hasn't even been the best playoff scorer during his two playoff years.  |Rk|Player|PTS|2P%|3P%|FT%|TS%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Luka Doncic|33.5|.554|.392|.600|.582| |2|Donovan Mitchell|33.5|.522|.475|.933|.666|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/psl_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 6/8/2021.
I dont think Kawhi going 5/24 from 3 in 4 games vs Utah the past 2 yrs is something that's predictive of anything going forward the way you might be suggesting. Ill take my chances on Paul George being able to figure out how to score vs Donovan Mitchell also who's the guy who's spent the most time guarding him this year.
"Yeah said this back in February when they played matchup in general no bueno for Utah. Bet on LAC yesterday.   --Rudy Gobert not gonna be able to exploit and punish LAC for playing so much Morris at the 5.   --Utah is one wing defender shorter tbh for a Paul George/Kawhi lineup. Joe ingles is also 3 yrs older now than when he handled his son PG last time   --LAC switching alot is the type of thing that can neutralize alot of the actions Utah runs. Not the same type of motion offense you saw in the past but there is still some of that and in particular rely a ton on Gobert as a screener which teams have switched in the past to neutralize alot of their actions.   --- Too many defenders LAC will hunt and that's the type of thing they do. Kawhi was hunting Donovan when they played in the reg season. Bojan will get targeted. Jordan Clarkson definitely will also. Makes it easier for LAC   ---Like the article talks about Utah is built around taking away the rim, not something that really changes how LAC plays alot.   ---Solid LAC matchups across the board for Utah perimeter players. PG's length can get over the Conley pick and rolls make it harder for him to get off especially those floaters. Batum/Kawhi can do fine on Mitchell/Clarkson."
"Donovan literally averaged like 40 ppg against the Nuggets last season on insane efficiency.  This year he‚Äôs arguably the best player on the best team in the league, the one game Utah didn‚Äôt have him in the playoffs they lost.   Mitchell&gt;"
Donovan Mitchell Devin Booker Trae Young Jayson Tatum
"Donovan Mitchell scored 57 in his first playoff game. Jamal Murray scored an insane amount of points. Teams that were there played there asses off, that title still matters IMO."
Rudy Gobert &gt; Donovan Mitchell
"Part of it is Dallas just doesn't have a real 2nd option. It's masked a bit because Luka can shoulder that burden really well.  Like if the Mavs have someone besides him who can run an nba offense he probably doesn't score 35 per game, but they also probably win this series.  I think he definitely has the BBIQ to coexist beautifully with a Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker type scoring guard with playmaking skills. Someone to play off of who can also effectively run the offense while he takes breaks."
"Such a dumb question to begin with. This team would go for a 48-0 3-peat and win every game by 30 points:  Donovan Mitchell  CJ McConnel  Paul George  Bam Adebayo  Karl Anthony Towns  Bench: Dragic, Robert Covington, Nurkic  So I guess Paul George (or whoever you pick) is capable of being the best player on the greatest dynasty ever"
Would a single finals MVP for donovan mitchell or rudy gobert this year be enough to make them the Jazz franchise GOAT?
"its probably closer than some people have it, but tatum is taller and like a year and a half younger  so he'd still go #1 in a redraft by a pretty sound consensus i think  this could also shift a bit within the next few weeks. Donovan is a bad bad boy and he could do some things coming up here. Theres a world where donovan mitchell leads the jazz to the NBA championship on 35ppg in the finals"
Would this mean Donovan Mitchell would eventually be on the Pelicans?
"Except Dame was vouching for Donovan Mitchell even texting him after the draft saying he wanted to play with him, and Portland picked fucking Zach Collins LMAO."
"By VORP, [the Clips' 3rd best player has been Nic Batum](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAC/2021.html#all_advanced-playoffs_advanced).  By BPM, it's been Rondo.  By overall win shares, it's been... PG, with Zubac in 2nd.  By WS/48, it's been Yogi Ferrell (lol). Zubac takes 2nd here, too, and Ibaka and Rondo are 4th and 5th. PG is down in 7th, interestingly.  On the one hand, it's a good thing to have a variety of player that have been contributing, depending on the way you measure contribution. However, I can also see that as a weakness, as it might imply that each player has holes in their game. Zubac, for instance, is almost certainly going to be played very little, despite the fact he's been a very good contributor by WS.  For comparison, the Jazz have a consistent top 4 across all those metrics - Gobert, Conley, Mitchell, and Ingles, in some order - except WS/48, which puts Favors 2nd and Donovan down in 6th."
So from what I got from this is only the Clippers players mattered? Not even mentioning that Conley was out the second game as well(so yes throw that one out) Bogey had like a 3 month shooting slump to start the season and Mitchell doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúrandomly get hot‚Äù. He averaged 36 in a playoff series last year. He‚Äôs proven to be one of the best playoff scorers in the league (when he‚Äôs not playing the Rockets). The Clippers easily could win this series but people are still massively underrating the Jazz and especially Donovan.
"if shelling out huge contracts for Evan Turner, Allen Crabbe, Moe Harkless and Meyers Leonard won't do it, or drafting Zach Collins over Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, OG Anunoby, John Collins and Derrick White won't do it, this asinine shit is fine.  How does this MFer still have a job?"
"imo, they should really go with some of the young up-and-coming stars like Ja, Zion, Tatum, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, Bam, Devin Booker, Zach Lavine, and other young guys.   Of course, if it's Dame Time and he wants to play, he should play too, but I have a feeling some of the young guys who have never been to the Olympics before would be more likely to go and play hard.   But goddamn, imagine watching Zion and Bam dunking lobs from Trae and Ja... good stuff"
I mean he could take playing with some of the most talented players and smartest basketball coaches in the world and learn from them. Coming back even better than before.  I know that playing on team USA really helped Donovan Mitchell grow.  I don't understand when team USA became this optional event. If I idolized guys like MJ or Kobe and had the chance to play on the team just like them id take that opportunity 10 times out of 10. I'm sure some of these guys feel the same way
"You do realise Team USA brought Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker, Harrison Barnes, Myles Turner, and Khris Middleton to the 2019 World Cup and still finished seventh, right?"
"Of course it applied to every team. That's how you end up with Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell turning into prime Steph Curry for a series.   Things that would never happen happened, for any team. It was nothing like a normal title run."
"I think the series has a better chance to go 7 than 4.  Both teams are going to cause the other issues.   The Jazz can shoot the 3 and move the ball extremely well. The Jazz have 3 guys who can create their spot other than Mitchell. You have to plan for Bogi, Clarkson, &amp; Conley as well as Mitchell.   The Clips have the best player in the series in Kawhi and he can change the outcome with dominant play. In addition the Clips have Paul George who can take over games and be borderline unguardable. The Clips are also a deep team as well as the Jazz.   There are many interesting facets of the series.   How the Clips will try their small lineup with Gobert. How Gobert will be able to defend Batum on a perimeter.   How the Jazz will work their offense with a switching defense and how the Clips will be able to stop Donovan Mitchell from penetrating or rising up over a switch with Batum or lessor defender.   How each team's benches will play? Clarkson by all accounts had an off series against Memphis, will he continue to be a volume shooter or be more efficient. Will Kennard bulleye 3's and will Mann continue his reign of terror?  Lots of interesting factors."
I reject this reality and replace it with my own..  ... I am looking forward to seeing the Donovan Mitchell statue erected in Salt Lake
"I really don't see any validity in the Hawks comparison because we ""don't have a superstar player"". Donovan Mitchell averages 28 points a night in the playoffs while the Hawks had one player score 30 in a game all season that year."
if you replaced Donovan mitchell with luka. the jazz would be ridiculous. this is what we are talking about when we want to surround him with shooters. not only do they have shooters they have several slasher. and a big that will screen and do pnr
"Keep sleeping on Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert, not being included in honorable mentions even on these lists. Just go watch the highlights from both of true analysts who study the game on YouTube and not entertainment analysts who say what you want to hear or what you don‚Äôt to troll for clickbait. The True number one seed that struggled just like the lakers at times when either weren‚Äôt on the court."
"No disrespect to the Jazz but nah we matchup way better against guard based teams such as you guys or the blazers. pat bev is an excellent defender against guards but as you saw this series he gets neutralized versus bigger stronger forwards. He played great defense against donovan mitchell and dame in the reg season. And we like to blitz players off of screens but taller playmakers like luka can look above our players and make the right pass as opposed to players like dame who couldn't and got completely neutralized. Not saying the clippers are favored, I think it goes to 7 and either team can win tbh"
Donovan mitchell man

No team with Donovan Mitchell as it's primary perimeter creator is going anywhere in the playoffs.
Clips are clearly targeting Donovan Mitchell on defense
"who is wrong?  There was friction, [they're on the record about it](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29406398/utah-jazz-stars-donovan-mitchell-rudy-gobert-rift-them) in the national media you seem to despise so.  Maybe more was made out of it than was actually there, but there was a strain in the relationship between Mitchell &amp; Gobert even before COVID last season.  Do things get overhyped to increase traffic? Sure.  At the same time the national sources that are well connected aren't just making shit up."
"Conley absolutely has been better than Mitchell, and if Kyrie and KD are getting starter spots with their missed games then Conley's missed games shouldn't matter either.  Buuuuuut Donovan is like 6th on the MVP tracker despite Gobert, Conley and even potentially arguably Clarkson being as important as him this season. It will be him and Gobert and no luck for Conley again unfortunately."
If Donovan Mitchell scores 50 in the regular season it would be the same for him.
"He's right. It's inexcusable. It's not just Shaq, either. Remember the whole ""Who he play for?"" segment they used to always do with Charles Barkley? They actually made it a running gag for these former players, who get paid to discuss &amp; cover the league, to not know who the people they're talking about even are or what team they're on. Let's not forget all the JaVale McGee drama from Shaqtin'-A-Fool or the more recent Donovan Mitchell fiasco. It's moved from them talking about just end of the bench guys that get very little playing time to now insulting All-Stars &amp; championship contenders. It's crazy."
classic ESPN having a 10 minute segment on Donovan Mitchell as the pregame to Bulls Sixers
"You people are way too sensitive about Shaq   Id rather hear from him then an nba analyst with zero personality, at the end of the day shaq has been there, done that, his views on the general game are very important final mvps, rings, played with great players...and that whole table hes in a unique position  between chuck and kenny...has the rings like kenny but was also the star man like chuck  People upset at him not knowing a name or that Donovan Mitchell interview are stupidly sensitive"
"Please tell me which nba players got over a million votes more than him despite not getting nearly as much attention.   He got the 18th most fan votes despite basically being a rookie on the team with a bottom tier record. Unless the nba / media thought that the current set of superstars will play forever then it makes perfect sense why they would heavily market one of the most exciting young players in the league.   I also don‚Äôt think they feel comfortable yet in their next generation of stars. Sure you have Luka, but then you have a bunch of players that in my opinion still have some questions on if they could be face of the league type guys. Keep in mind we‚Äôre coming out of a generation that had Steph, KD, Giannis, Kawhi, Harden, Dame, AD, Westbrook, Paul George, and because he transcends generations Lebron.   Guys like Tatum, Trey Young, Donovan Mitchell, etc should definitely be there, but after Luka its yet to be determined if any of that generation can reach Steph / KD levels of superstardom (Lebron really doesn‚Äôt count) and the NBA is clearing hoping that Zion can"
"I know the typical SG was 6‚Äô6 atleast back then and still even now, But ray allen and a few other 6‚Äô4/6‚Äô5 SGs were hanging around then. I only asked cause Donovan Mitchell looks really small in comparison to Dwade. I believe he‚Äôs only like 6‚Äô1."
"He does seem like he‚Äôs not his usual self but he also wasn‚Äôt with the usual panel with Ernie, Chuck, and Kenny. He‚Äôs just Shaq. (His interviewing skills with Donovan Mitchell need to improve though haha)"

That's insane. Has to be a top % for a guard that takes more then 7 shots a game around the rim. Donovan Mitchell has been struggling around the rim this year. He's shooting around 48%. Couldn't imagine him shooting around 70% he'd be a top 5 scorer.
"Yeah, exactly. In other words, it's reasonable that a 50% shooter (e.g, Dwight Howard) or an 84% shooter (e.g, Donovan Mitchell) could start off 17/25. On the other hand, the odds of Dwight Howard (or even Donovan Mitchell) starting off 95/105 is so incredibly small that we know Harden's FT% must be above that.   As Joe Harris takes more free throws this range will narrow, but it wouldn't be surprising for him have a FT% of 80% at the end of the season.  Note: We're making the (solid) assumption that a player has a ""true"" free throw percentage that doesn't change throughout the season. In that case, each shot gets us closer to revealing what that FT% is. The only case this assumption should fail is a significant midseason injury."
"NBA tries to get premier games in prime time slots. (See LAL v BKN last night). I am an NBA fan and those are the games I watch during the regular season (and Celtics games ;)).   As for picking a favorite team, find a player you enjoy to watch and/or like their story and follow their games. NBA is a star driven league so it‚Äôs not hard.   As for understanding the game, the elite level of athleticism and size of the NBA makes seemingly impossible things look common. Enjoy the speed (Kyrie), physicality (lebron, giannis), athleticism (donovan Mitchell, Ja Morant, Zion) and skill (curry, jokic) for a time.   Then you can watch how teams set their stars up to have the most success ( screens, isolations, ball movement), how the other teams defend that (switch‚Äôs, double teams, spacing). Once you notice that you will see how the best players are nearly impossible to stop because of their uniqueness (like Kevin Durant).   If watching a whole game is too much, watch the fourth quarter. That is when things get really interesting. Also, playoff games are really a different thing. More physical, more drama, more everything. Follow the storylines of series and you will start to understand more.   Good luck on your basketball journey!"
"I like to compare Donovan Mitchell to a flashy and talented wide receiver like Deandre Hopkins, whereas Gobert is the entire offensive and defensive line.  Both are important, but Rudy does more/fulfills more obligations while being only 1/5 of the teams presence on the floor. I agree OP"
"These are neat little facts, but media awards are not a statistics, nor do they change the dominant stats Utah is putting up right now.  Like, Rudy Gobert was All NBA 3rd team last year, are you seriously implying that Utah's Championship hopes are dashed simply because there were 2 better centers than Rudy Gobert?  Utah is a well balanced team with a lot of weapons from a lot of different places.  You seem to like media awards a lot-- this team has a legitimate shot at COTY, DPOY, and 6MOTY right now, and none of those awards even involve Donovan Mitchell, who has already shown he can flip a switch for the Playoffs.   A much worse version of this Jazz team has already taken out MVP's and All NBA players like Westbrook and Paul George before.  Just last year, they were 2 points away from beating the team who made the WCF while missing a 20ppg scorer.  I dunno, man, I just feel like people saying Utah isn't a contender because they don't have these cute ass media awards this far into the season is just a really dumb take at this point."
"&gt; please tell me what bias there would be in reporting the outcome of a basketball game  That's easy, it happens all the time.  &gt;Donovan Mitchell scores 24 as the Jazz Beat the Wolves  As a headline for a hypothetical game where Mitchell shoots inefficiently and Rudy Gobert had a better game with 17-14-6 and great defense or something. I don't mean to pick on Mitchell, I just wanted an example where a team's best performance may come from a guy who doesn't score as much, but the media and fans have a bias toward points.  That headline would be 100% facts, no opinion. But there's a bias in what facts you present. The other one is when you're a channel like ESPN and you choose which stories to even talk about. If you're 100% reporting facts and showing highlights, but you always choose highlights for the Lakers while ignoring those from a less popular team, that's reporting facts with a bias."
"Yes, we over complicate things. That's why if you ask nba experts they would all pretty much agree that Gobert is the better and more important player between the two  Yes, Donovan Mitchell in his 4th year needs to get out of his 1st seeded team as fast as he can"
"&gt;3 Elite Scoring Options: Donovan Mitchell, Bojan Bogdanavic, Jordan Clarkson   ‚ÄúElite‚Äù."
"&gt; 3 Elite Scoring Options: Donovan Mitchell, Bojan Bogdanavic, Jordan Clarkson  Holy hyperbole lmao"
Of course they can  Cp3 is 6 feet. Faces up and shoots over guys 8 inches taller than him. So does Kyrie.  They do it all the time   A guy like Donovan Mitchell could develop it. Has a nice release point and long arms
People who think that Rudy Gobert is better than Donovan Mitchell probably also thought Ben Wallace was better than Dwyane Wade when they were playing lol
The record matter so much more with all NBA than all star.  From a talent and skill and playwise it's hard to say who I'd put over him. Donovan Mitchell assuming the jazz stay a top team. Maybe Jaylen brown if he counts as a guard? (I think they counted him as back court for all star voting)
"Quite possible. On another note, did you know that Donovan Mitchell was there in the room during that train wreck of an experience."
At the end of [this clip](https://streamable.com/tqdusn) you can see their Western picks. The standouts to me are that Chuck picked Jordan Clarkson over AD while Kenny picked Chris Paul over Donovan Mitchell.
"You‚Äôre right. It‚Äôs a bad comp, mainly because I fell victim to the same thing I was arguing against: Comparing players from today to the 80s. It doesn‚Äôt translate well at all. I mentioned him because he‚Äôs one of the smaller players in the league.   I don‚Äôt know weight lifting very well, but isn‚Äôt deadlifting primarily legs? Your last point makes sense from a bb basics POV, as jumping is arguably the most important part of a mechanically sound shooting form. That is one of the reasons I love Donovan Mitchell so much. He jumps to the ceiling during his jump shot."
and Donovan Mitchell for absolutely no reason lol fuckin normie
The highest number that a player's worn where they've matched their jersey number is probably Donovan Mitchell with 45. Can't think of any others atm.      Actually nvm he's scored exactly 46 points three times but never exactly 45.
"If your argument is that Dame should start over Luka because of wins, then shouldn't the argument be for Donovan Mitchell starting over both of them?"
I'm just happy to see Donovan Mitchell 4th among West guards and Rudy Gobert 4th among media voted West front court players.
By that logic Donovan Mitchell should have started over Dame so why even argue about this
"&gt; Nah, it‚Äôs just not relevant  How can you say this with a straight face. By your standards that how well a guy is actually playing doesn't really matter much then Donovan Mitchell is the MVP right now."
We do this every year with Gobert and it never gets old. Hits the post season and he‚Äôs damn near unplayable and Donovan Mitchell is scoring something ridiculous to win the Jazz games. Guess we‚Äôre doing it again this year.
A better scoring Donovan Mitchell
Y'all are sleeping on Donovan Mitchell making a 1st team
I remember that game against the Spurs where he hit like four threes in the fourth to seal it. Then that game in Utah (where we won‚Äôt mention the result) when Donovan Mitchell was chirping Gary in the postgame press conference was when I really fell in love with the guy
Then Donovan Mitchell is the MVP.
1a )Donovan Mitchell  1b) Mike Conley  1c) Bojan Bogdinovic  1d) Joe Ingles  1e) Rudy Gobert
"Shaq: ‚ÄúThat ain‚Äôt the kind of jewelry he should be goin after, Erneh... isn‚Äôt that right, Chuck?‚Äù  Barkley: ‚ÄúHey Shaq, how the Jazz doin after your speech to Donovan Mitchell? You think you could suit up and take on Gobert?... or my pick for the MVP, Nikoler Gokitch?‚Äù"
There‚Äôs no way Donovan Mitchell is better right now than deron Williams lol. Clearly a better playmaker and more efficient relative to his era he just was more in control and broke down defenses better. Peak deron Williams is a top 15 player in today‚Äôs nba mitchell still has too many of the same issues he had as a rookie to be more than a low to mid(at best) level all star
let me try my team division  Damian lillard   Donovan Mitchell  Shai gilgeous alexander  Nikola jokic  Karl anthony towns
"Donovan Mitchell isn't close to the 3 other players IMO, so Lillard/Roy.  Even tho I think D-Will strenght would cause a ton of problem for Dame defensively."
"I may be going against the grain here, but what Simmons has to do on a nightly basis is more difficult and optically going to be much less appreciated than what Gobert does. Gobert is great don't get me wrong, but he's not having to go guard players like Lebron, Book, Donovan Mitchell, etc. He can still mostly patrol the paint and use his size and length to lock down that area. Simmons does that, albeit not at the same level, plus guarding a star player all the time. And given how good players are now, Ben could be doing a great job and still give up 25 points to a good player."
Yup performance is a fluke just look at donovan mitchell now oh wait wrong narrative
**40 points or higher**  Joel Embiid - 49pts   Brandon Ingram - 49pts   Zach Lavine - 49pts   Paul George - 48pts   Jamal Murray - 48pts   Danillo Gallinari - 47pts   Victor Oladipo - 47pts   Andrew Wiggins - 47pts   Luka Doncic - 46pts   Donovan Mitchell - 46pts   Kawhi Leonard - 45pts   Julius Randle - 45pts   JR Smith - 45pts   Bojan Bogdanovic - 44pts   Gordon Hayward - 44pts   Ja Morant - 44pts   Pascal Siakam - 44pts   Jeff Green - 43pts   Jaren Jackson Jr. - 43pts   Chris Paul - 43pts   Nikola Vucevic - 43pts   Kyle Lowry - 43pts   Michael Beasley - 42pts   Jaylen Brown - 42pts   Trey Burke - 42pts   Jordan Clarkson - 42pts   Marc Gasol - 42pts   Buddy Hield - 42pts   Jodie Meeks - 42pts   Terry Rozier - 42pts   Collin Sexton - 42pts   Ben Simmons - 42pts   Bam Adebayo - 41pts   Eric Bledsoe - 41pts   Allen Crabbe - 41pts   Spencer Dinwiddie - 41pts   Tyreke Evans - 41pts   Rudy Gay - 41pts   Aaron Gordon - 41pts   Gerald Green - 41pts   Kyle Kuzma - 41pts   Austin Rivers - 41pts   Dennis Schroder - 41pts   Jayson Tatum - 41pts   Karl-Anthony Towns - 41pts   Grayson Allen - 40pts   Trevor Ariza - 40pts   Mike Conley - 40pts   Goran Dragic - 40pts   Devonte Graham - 40pts   Dwight Howard - 40pts   Reggie Jackson - 40pts   Kelly Oubre - 40pts   Kristaps Porzingis - 40pts   JJ Reddick - 40pts
donovan mitchell is clearly the better shooter between the two.
"If anything, Donovan Mitchell has the closest build to a NFL wide receiver on the Jazz"
Donovan Mitchell got some ugly ass hair
"man he doesn't, he just has a wack ass way of communicating with people that doesn't come across well on television. if he had done the whole donovan mitchell thing courtside and off camera somewhere, donovan would have handled it completely differently and shaq wouldn't look weird. it's only odd because shaq is an awkward motherfucker with no sense of timing so he did it on TV. it wasn't disrespectful at all, it was just the entirely wrong medium to do it in, and he didn't recognise that."
Delusional Jazz homers in this thread are going to keep downvoting my Donovan Mitchell comments even though they eventually will snap back into reality.
Why is the picture of Donovan Mitchell?
"NW division would be a fun ultra small + ultra big line-up:  Dame  Donovan Mitchell  SGA  Jokic  Gobert   Let's get fuckin weird.  You also get Jamal Murray, Conley &amp; CJ as ultra smalls and KAT as another big.  Sprinkle in some Dort, MPJ, Ingles and Bojan Bogdanovic and you've actually got a pretty good squad"
smoking that monumentally large Donovan Mitchell pack
The Gobert deal is a complete nightmare. Donovan Mitchell is that dude though.
I wanted the jazz to win. But back in March I got laughed at on here for saying the jazz weren‚Äôt contenders. They don‚Äôt really have a championship squad. Donovan Mitchell is not a #1 option.
Donovan Mitchell played amazing.
"he gave an inspirational speech to donovan mitchell, he's a good coach."
Yeah regular season he's 80% minimum: https://www.espn.com/nba/player/stats/_/id/3908809/donovan-mitchell
"Yeah, these two series have been incredible showings of resilience from the clippers, pretty crazy to say  But yeah Donovan Mitchell is a superstar now, regardless of what the rest of his team did. Absolutely fucking balled out these playoffs"
"I don‚Äôt believe in Donovan Mitchell or Rudy Gobert, to be honest. Too many defensive liabilities due to both of their respective sizes. Mitchell can at least negate him being a 6‚Äô1‚Äù, shooting guard with STREAKY monster offensive production and being able to create his own shot. Gobert is literally only situationally advantageous aka a regular season rim protection god."
I think even at this point Ben Simmons knows Donovan Mitchell is way better than him.
Donovan Mitchell on his way to help pack Rudy Gobert‚Äôs bags
They better be ready for the donovan mitchell jersey photoshops lmao
I‚Äôd go to war with Donovan Mitchell any day. That guy deserves so much better than what Gobert gave him
"Everyone should give mad respect to Donovan Mitchell. On one knee the dude put on a show, lights out shooting. He‚Äôs a true superstar. Congrats to the Clippers, incredible comeback, Ty Lue is one helluva coach. Masterful performance to adjust and comeback in each of their two series."
Donovan Mitchell deserves better.  He‚Äôs limping off the court.  He gave it everything while hurt and no one else showed up
Good to see Donovan Mitchell has the integrity to stay and shake hands.
"Tough day for Jazz fans. First Stockton, then this.  Sheesh. At least y‚Äôall have a real one in Mitchell.  This playoffs has shown that being on an all NBA defensive team means *jack shit*.  Get Gobert out of there for someone who can take the offensive load off of Donovan."
Paul George talking to Donovan Mitchell like he won something man this your first time bro don't be trying to give fool advice
Donovan Mitchell probably wants to kill someone
Congrats to the Clippers for coming back to win the series. Donovan Mitchell is a fucking warrior. Gobert got exposed hard again. You can't have him on the floor against a small ball line up.
"Terence Mann : I'm going to beat you with a crowbar until you leave.  Donovan Mitchell : You can't do that.  Terence Mann : There are rules here? No, there are no rules here.  [advances with crowbar]"
"Things I totally expected: Terrence Mann is the leading scorer of the playoffs today in less minutes than Paul George, Donovan Mitchell, Joel Embiid and Trae Young"
Who is gonna be the first person to make a Donovan Mitchell or Terance Mann thread?
donovan mitchell pls go t-mac mode and score 13 in 33 seconds
Feel bad for Donovan Mitchell
I'm looking at Donovan Mitchell shaking his head and remember that the Clippers saved the Jazz from being clowned for blowing a 3-1 lead.
Why the cameraman doing Donovan Mitchell like that...he's going thru feelings man
Donovan Mitchell is going to request a trade
Donovan Mitchell lookin at Quinn like ‚Äúyou got 50 more seconds to say what‚Äôs on your chest cause I ain‚Äôt never seeing you again‚Äù üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Donovan Mitchell deserves better than Rudy Gobert. If Gobert is this much of a playoff defensive liability what the fuck are they even doing
Feels good seeing the Jazz lose like this ‚ù§Ô∏è  Wish Donovan Mitchell played somewhere else üíî
Imagine being Donovan fucking Mitchell. This dude has been superb in two consecutive years of playoff performances‚Äîonly to be let down when it matters the most.
"Donovan Mitchell is such a warrior man, sucks he‚Äôs going out like this"
I feel so bad for Donovan Mitchell
"I got so much respect for Donovan Mitchell, playing through all these injuries and still torching us is amazing"
Donovan Mitchell is not a superstar. Gobert is not a star. Jazz fake #1 seed.   See ya next year.
Free Donovan Mitchell from this dumpster fire
"Oh no, terrible to see. Donovan Mitchell is such a great player."
can y'all get donovan mitchell some fuckin help. jesus.
Man Donovan Mitchell gets all my respect. What a player
Donovan Mitchell gave them everything he had
Where were you when Donovan Mitchell decided to force a trade to the Knicks?
Donovan Mitchell gonna look crazy in a Mavs jersey
You really can‚Äôt touch Donovan Mitchell it‚Äôs wild
Man I feel bad for Donovan Mitchell
what the fuck even is gobert lol. also i love when a team collapses and everyone just defaults to blaming the teams best player. big lead choked? donovan mitchell must be terrible
Just going at Donovan Mitchell relentlessly on defense. Him and Clarkson earlier
"I am getting kind of sick of these threads about how good the jazz are and we need to respect them, blah blah blah...  The jazz are hoes. On them we shall stunt.  2 points:  1. The jazz beat the Lakers in Staples. A Lakers team that was slumping, limped into the playoffs, and lost to a legit bottom 3 team in the league (The Kings, also hoes) at home, in a game.  2. Yes Donovan Mitchell is a good, bruising style PG. I ask you what good is a game manager PG when you are down 3 Possession??? Go will be forced to pass against a secondary that has 2 ALL PRO PGs  We are going to destroy the Jazz. Our offensive is a f***ing buzzsaw. Our defense is stacked and hungry. Mann is playing better than Jesus right now.  Get it together homies, BIG TRUSS."
Guys it‚Äôs time for Donovan Mitchell to request a trade
"Donovan ""supposed top 10 player"" Mitchell can't close out the Kawhi-less Clippers."
i‚Äôm rooting for clippers but i feel bad for Donovan Mitchell.
I genuinely feel bad for Donovan Mitchell
Was Shaq right about Donovan Mitchell? üò≠
Terrance Mann &gt; Donovan Mitchell
Batum's fully embraced this center thing by moving like a center retreating in the pick and roll vs Donovan Mitchell . Far too late to cut off the driving lane even when he's clearly in position to.
Donovan Mitchell is so tough
Bro Donovan Mitchell is the real deal
Donovan mitchell so casual
Donovan Mitchell: 30 points in 28 minutes  That‚Äôs like a point a minute!
Donovan  Mitchell  Donovan Mitchell  Spida  D-Mitch
"Hell of a shot.    But these logos are getting bigger and bigger, we‚Äôre like 5 years away from ‚ÄúDonovan Mitchell makes his first free throw from the logo‚Äù"
Donovan Mitchell &gt;&gt;&gt; Ben Simmons
Donovan Mitchell 45 pt triple double inc
"Donovan Mitchell, so hot right now"
Donovan Mitchell is definitely wearing butt pads
"I feel like the Jazz are probably the easiest team to come back on other than the 6ers. Their entire offense is 3s and Donovan Mitchell. If those 3s don‚Äôt fall, Mitchell can be doubled and there goes the lead."
"Donovan Mitchell should be shooting like 20% considering the difficulty level of the shots he's taken. This is peak Kobe/JR Smith level of hitting contested, off-balance shots."
And that he won ROTY over Donovan Mitchell‚Ä¶ lmao
"Donovan Mitchell and Jordan Clarkson of the Utah Jazz have been on fire! If they keep scoring more than the Clippers, the Jazz will win the game."
"that half time analysis was literally just ""Donovan Mitchell and Jordan Clarkson are good at basketball"" smh"
I think what swung the momentum was Donovan Mitchell looking like himself this game.
Donovan Mitchell is very good.
"Donovan Mitchell looks good out there. Also, he‚Äôs playing well."
Donovan Mitchell is the GOAT
Donovan Mitchell is OP af
Jordan ‚ÄúDonovan Mitchell‚Äù Clarkson
Donovan Mitchell has to carry off a hurt ankle. Where is the JAZZ best player Gobert?
You're sick if you really think 70% Donovan Mitchell isn't good.
Donovan Mitchell could pass as Simone Biles brother. Don‚Äôt @ me.
Donovan Dwyane Wade in 06 Mitchell
No way Donovan Mitchell is even slightly injured lol
Damn bruh Donovan Mitchell really is the fuckin man lmao
Friendship over with John Stockton. Donovan Mitchell is new franchise GOAT

Elimination game Donovan Mitchell is lit
Donovan questionable Mitchell is looking pretty certain out there tonight.
donovan mitchell is finessing the clippers rn they think he still hurt üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Donovan Mitchell about to shoot the place up
Donovan ‚ÄúKirk Cousins‚Äù Mitchell
"The Clippers might have Playoff P, but the Jazz have  Donovan Mitchell, aka Playoff D."
Donovan Mitchell came to play
Donovan Mitchell got robbed
"Btw I'm not a Suns fan or anything, so I don't really have a horse in this race, aka nothing emotional for me in this argument, and the Jazz are cool and all and Donovan is an amazing player, and winning in playoffs is great but that was the first round against an underwhelming OKC team that ended up getting split up the next season because they couldn't play together at all. And you guys got gentlemen swept by the Rockets too. Donovan is great but he's not 70 pts at 20 years old great, he's also an injury risk and if we're talking about how the teams are right now, I would say Booker matters more to the Suns than Donovan to the Jazz, and therefore, the Suns' success is more integral on Booker, whereas the Jazz are still strong without Donovan Mitchell."
"Actually more of an indictment on him. IMO he deserved that ROTY award, and considering he‚Äôs younger, he should be much better than Donovan is rn. But Mitchell is tearing up the playoffs for the past 2 years and Ben is a crunch time liability."
Donovan Mitchell is great but he hasn't dropped 70 in a game at 20 years old...
"You had multiple opportunities to get out of that hole, Kennard over Donovan Mitchell, Stanley Johnson over Booker, trading Khris Middleton and Dinwiddie, etc, if we draft well we‚Äôll be fine and looking at how we‚Äôve out drafted multiple lottery teams with the 29th pick I think I have hope."
"Remember when us dumbass Sixers fans actually thought Ben Simmons was better than Donovan Mitchell?  I don't like Mitchell, or the Jazz, but I'm also not blind."
"Kevin Durant, Booker and Donovan Mitchell ahead for sure."
Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker?
Donovan Mitchell is the franchise player for the Jazz
"This is very short sighted and dumb.   The west is stacked with guards he would have to be voted over Harden, Klay, Paul George, Kawhi, Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Eric Gordon, etc any given year.   Also, the all star game is a popularity contest this is a dumb measurement of a players worth.   The Sixers need another option who can create their own shot and not stack the paint so Embiid can work.   Your opinion is bad."
"Just making a quick list (not very accurate) I‚Äôd put him in the 20-30 range. Your 16-22 range seems a little too optimistic.  Embiid, Giannis, Middleton, Durant, Harden, Kyrie, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Capela, Bam Adebayo, Gobert, LeBron, AD, Kawhi, Paul George, Chris Paul, DeRozan, Damian Lillard, Jokic, Steph, Christian Wood, Zion, Luka  That‚Äôs 24 players. All of these players besides Bam are on a team with a better record then the Knicks. You could probably put him over a few of them though.  Ben Simmons, Sabonis, Gordon Hayward, Lavine, Beal, Conley, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Fox  There‚Äôs 9 players kind of in that same range. Maybe below, maybe above Randle depending on your argument."
Tell Ben Simmons that :( Donovan Mitchell ROY truther for life over here
"That doesn't change the fact that those narratives are parroted.. Also saying there's a video about anything doesn't disprove that the vid is factual.. because otherwise you can use that argument for anything.   I literally just got done hearing Bill Simmon's reference that Steph was getting shit from social media on his podcast. Curry has referenced ""hearing the noise/critics""   When Curry had his 62pt game Seth Curry referenced his brothers legacy:https://twitter.com/sdotcurry/status/1345943379255947265  Donovan Mitchell said mfs was talking crazy:https://twitter.com/spidadmitchell/status/1345943345022070784  All the crazy talk was about how Curry had to ""prove himself"", how he needed to carry a bad team to the playoffs or his legacy should be questioned. All of this is what basically was talked about in the video. I know it's just bullshit takes, but they were loud.. Even NBA players noticed it, idk how y'all haven't."
"Giannis plays in the East, so the net rating gets inflated when they are playing worse teams.   I just looked at the Clippers (Kawhi), Donovan Mitchell, and Jokic. The only one with a positive Net rating was Mitchell (impressively high) but Gobert‚Äôs even comes in at .36   It‚Äôs hard to be a net positive team when your best player is not in the court. If they are they are doing their job."
"I think plenty of people who have played organized sports didn't like it, donovan mitchell for example"
If that team added donovan mitchell i think it could be the 1 seed in the west
"I don't think most people think Devin Booker should be an all-star this year. Donovan Mitchell is the best player on the #1 team in the NBA right now, so that adds a lot more weight than just comparing their stats. De'Aaron Fox could be an all-star this year, but it also wouldn't be crazy if he wasn't, he's on the bubble imo."
Frank Ntilikina for Donovan Mitchell and a 2023 Second sounds fair
Lol y‚Äôall picked Frankie Smokes and Kevin Knox over Donovan Mitchell and SGA
"lol far be it from me to criticize the guy whose user name is no more jews...  but i think your claim that donovan mitchell is racist for wanting kids to be exposed to positive black role models and learn the history of black people in america MIGHT not be correct and in fact might reveal a little bit too much about your own personal beliefs regarding black people  so i think actually you are the ignorant racist who needs to shut the fuck up, but hey i'm just a stranger on the internet"
"Which other players tried and locked in their local nicknames despite them  being near nonsense? I‚Äôve got Donovan Mitchell and now Sexton too.   Celtics fans like to call Peyton Pritchard by his old twitter handle fastpp but he aborted that in the preseason. :,("
"dog you called ""Doncic, Trae, KAT, Jokic, Booker, maybe Tatum, Zion and Murray."" future hall of famers.   You think TRAE is more sure of a bet than Tatum? Tatum is a legit top 5 MVP candidate. Jamaal is not even close to a hall of famer, neither is KAT. Zion MAYBE if he can keep it up and stay healthy, Book MAYBE if he can win championships.   If you actually watch Lamelo every game you'd see. Even KD, donovan mitchell, etc. rave about the kid. He's 19 and will be an all star in 2-3 years. Remindme! 2 years"
"Seriously, am I taking crazy pills? Apparently in r/nba calling Donovan Mitchell an ignorant racist gets you upvotes, while calling idiots like that out gets massive downvotes"
"Jimmy Butler, Giannis, Joel Embiid, Donovan Mitchell, Chris Paul, Zach LaVine, Zion Williamson"
"Donovan Mitchell, Jaylen Brown, Klay, Ben Simmons, Embiid"
Trade you for a Donovan Mitchell vote.
"Maybe he shouldn't refer to it as black ""excellence"".  Imagine someone trying to teach about white excellence or asian excellence.  Donovan Mitchell is an ignorant racist and needs to shut the fuck up."
How can Donovan Mitchell be ‚Äúprogressing to‚Äù a game-time decision? He‚Äôs been playing. Wouldn‚Äôt this be a REgression?
"After tonight, my choice will be Donovan Mitchell."
Next we'll learn that Donovan Mitchell runs a dog fighting ring in his basement.
"It's not narrative, it is seeding really. Every time there is a guy who is heads and shoulders above anyone else in his team *and* is the first seed then always wins the MVP. That has held true from 1978 to now. You can check if you will.  That is the reason why Donovan Mitchell had no chance this year (Gobert was equally important to the Jazz's run) nor Embiid indeed (the rest of his team had to cover for him for 1/3rd of the season that he was out).  If you recall Giannis won easily that year, because being the clear best guy of a 1st seed is the easier way to win an MVP , it is a guaranteed one.  Narrative may start playing some role if it is a season where a textbook MVP is lacking from the 1st seed (like in this season) but even then, invariably, it is the next highest seeded guy who is also ""clear best"". Namely Jokic in this season, or LeBron in 2012, etc...  It is very rare that we get MVPs based on Narrative alone. First you need to not have a textbook MVP (like Harden in 2018, or Giannis in '19 and '20) *and* for some reason the next highest seededmwho is also clear best to not be selected for some reason (Kawhi in 2017), which is how we got Westbrook in 2017. It remains the only MVP which was mostly narrative based.  Everything else can be explained by the simple algorithm I described above. Harden had no chance in every season but 2018 (2015 was Curry, 2017 Kawhi and 2019 was Giannis)."
"I don't think Magic was that bad, granted he was working in tandem with Pelinka but they cleared cap space and successfully recruited LeBron. Lonzo Ball wasn't a bad pick either. It's not like anyone knew how Tatum (3rd pick) or Donovan Mitchell (13th pick) was really going to pan out, but regardless the result would have ended the same way: they'd be traded for Anthony Davis.   There is actually a chance that if Magic weren't GM, Lebron wouldn't be a Laker right now. the biggest issue with Magic was that he didn't prioritize his job (often no-showing) and always had other business matters to take care of."
Luka Doncic  Trae Young  Jayson Tatum  Zion Williamson  Donovan Mitchell  Devin Booker  Ja Morant  Lamelo Ball  De'Aaron Fox
"My whole point is it is getting tougher and tougher, so yes it has happened if you go back 10 years but it's not the same now.  2011 Dirk today might request a trade saying this isn't going anywhere.  There certainly would be more pressure on him to do that.  Yes the Warriors drafted well but Curry and Thompson being available past pick like 5 is very very rare.  If you go back through the last 4 or 5 drafts nobody remotely close to that caliber is taken late and by late I mean after the first few picks.  Maybe Donovan Mitchell.  With all due respect to the Raptors if Durant doesn't tear his Achilles and Klay doesn't tear his ACL they don't win that season.   It's not big market I'm talking about, I'm saying it all comes down to a few stars and where they want to play.  If they don't pick you, you basically need the stars to align with two historically great players falling to you past the top few picks or major injuries at the right time.  The Spurs won the lottery and their guy wanted to stay, if we're being honest I'd say those Warriors teams or the Nets healthy now would beat all those Spurs teams.  Most teams have no chance at getting Durant or Kawhi or Kyrie or Steph or LeBron or Davis.  Much less another guy of that caliber which is what you really need or you're ""wasting his talent"" because all you can get is role players and overpaid Middleton/Hayward caliber pseudo stars."
Yeah I‚Äôm sure Donovan Mitchell never pushes off. They all do it. Get over it.
as if Donovan was letting out some secret that anyone watching the game could not have figured out for themselves.  Mitchell can‚Äôt get his usual lift and explosiveness on his injured ankle? No shit?
"I dunno how much we have to see defense barely matter in the playoffs before we stop using it as a key factor in these comparisons.  The Hawks ran a closing lineup of Trae and Lou Williams vs the 6ers, the Nets even just with healthy KD and Kyrie were primed to roll to at least the Finals with a terrible defense. Kawhi and PG are supposed to be two of the best perimeter defenders in the league and were getting ripped in half on a nightly basis by Luka and Donovan Mitchell when they weren't injured."

"Ok but you see the difference between Donte Divincenzo and Jaylen Brown, Anthony Davis, James Harden, Jamal Murray, and Donovan Mitchell right?"
That was probably Adidas just like how they egged on the ROY award debate with Donovan Mitchell and Ben Simmons
"Because only on  reddit and corners of social media does anyone really notice or follow the Jazz in the first place. If you watch traditional sports media the only people who get talked about are the Clippers. As far as TV is concerned the Clippers are playing a series against just some team, even if that team is the number 1 seed in the West.  TNT is  the only network that actually talks about the Jazz and even then it's really only Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert that get talked about frequently."
"The problem is....your actual Superstar - Giannis, he's the only superstar that you can't run 4th quarter offense through. The only one. So it creates this weird dynamic. Ideally Giannis would be paired with Donovan Mitchell or somepne that can score late in games and Middleton could go play with Luka or wherever and be the ideal #2 scorer and lockdown wing he's supposed to be."
Donovan Mitchell can replace Stockon on that. Take care of that  guy.
Donovan Mitchell seems good
"""I was behind Donovan Mitchell on a freeway on-ramp and...sorry, this next part is still difficult for me üòî.....he didn't get up to speed before merging! üò¢ And like it wasn't one of those corkscrews that spit you out at max 45 into a lane that ends in 20 feet. It was a long straightaway! He got up to 55 tops, and then he just...*merged.* And I have to think about that and live with that every day of my life since."""
"No, that's our coach. Donovan Mitchell is going to be revealed to not hold the elevator for people running to catch it."
Stephen A Smith was not wrong when he said Donovan Mitchell is THE best player in Utah‚Äôs franchise history.
Hey at least Donovan Mitchell is a good dude.
"I think managing the load time during the playoffs is even more important. Players are playing physical basketball every possession and average 40 minutes in 7-game series every other day. Kawhi couldn't keep up, AD gave up even sooner. How much time can Donovan Mitchell and KD sustain this, for instance? Bud takes care of his players, which might have lost him some series, but at least in the long-run he is having better chances to compete each year."
Donovan Mitchell also takes more than 10 seconds but his never gets called

Damn Utah fans really can‚Äôt have a player to look up to huh. At this rate Donovan Mitchell is gonna be outed as a serial killer or some shit.
"&gt; [Adrian Wojnarowski on if there's a rift between Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/fhsp6x/adrian_wojnarowski_on_if_theres_a_rift_between/fkd8oco/?context=3): ""That is an astute observation. There is a lot of work to repair relationship between Rudy and Mitchell. There's a lot of frustration towards Rudy among the Jazz players""  I'm just posting the back and forth from what I was engaging at in real time. The parent comment made by a ""Fake News"" Jazz fan ended up being deleted, but that same sentiment can be found all over that post(I just posted my specific comment thread b/c I could find it via reddit comment search). FWIW a lot of folks deleted their comments/accounts, so some of the wilder stuff may be gone.  I'm honestly not up for litigating that topic all over again, and going up against the ""Fake News"" tendencies of the Utah crowd again.  Hopefully my comments from that day breaking down how reporting works helps(local vs. national, biases on all sides, etc.).   Also seeing the general back and forth b/w Jazz fans and everybody else in that post gives you a snapshot of that time. FWIW I pointed out how a lot of Rox fans also leaned into the ""Fake News"" narrative(like many other fanbases) when bad news started trickling out about Tillman Frittata."
"Looks like he's been watching Donovan Mitchell and thinking ""hey I can do that"""
Donovan Mitchell is questionable for the game tomorrow with ankle soreness. Kawhi out.
"Donovan Mitchell is exactly who every team should want as their future. He's a fucking psychopath but without the abrasiveness of guys like Jordan and Kobe, but he took the responsibility for the team as a rookie and has never shirked. When something goes wrong, he finds a way to make it his fault and works on fixing it. When something goes well he points to a teammate and makes it their victory instead.  My wife gets jealous of him."
I'm cool with whatever happens as long as the clippers lose.  Atlanta wins the chip = Trae pulls off the impossible = üëç  Sixers win = Embiid gets a title = üëç  Nets win = Harden + Griffin get a title = üëç  Milwaukee wins = silences the haters/Giannis gets a ring = üëç  Jazz win = Donovan Mitchell gets a ring = üëç  Suns win = Booker shuts everyone up and Paul gets a monkey off his back = üëç  Clippers win = fuck off
"I take huge issue with this. First of all they are absolutely paying these guys millions JUST TO PLAY A GAME. Not everybody is waiting around til after the game to hear an exhausted man answer the dumbest questions known to man. OR aggressively petty questions.   TNT and ESPN pay people lots of money for the right to broadcast games, not the interviews. That‚Äôs the bottom line.  The reason chuck is upset is because he is a talking head and they do not care about the game, they care about STORYLINES. The talking heads and the journalists RELY on players for livelihood and so of course they get upset when the players don‚Äôt want to participate in their shenanigans.   For example, why the fuck should Donovan Mitchell have to sit on camera and take shit from the TNT crew (chucks crew) about the various talking heads not believing in him after a victory.   It‚Äôs not just wins. They arent excited to talk to you fucking clowns at all and I wouldn‚Äôt be either. Kyrie wrong about the earth being flat but he‚Äôs right that these chucklefucks are pawns.   Coming from the SAME guy who got all pissy this week about not being able to call San Antonio women fat so he‚Äôs just gonna quit in a year. üôÑüôÑüôÑ"
If we are talking Playoffs give me Donovan Mitchell over most of those guys.
"I don't think you would.   I don't even think parity is a worthwhile goal personally, but this would not create parity at all regardless.  It would do the opposite.   Basketball is not football, it's so dependent on stars that even low end all stars will end up going for huge, huge money, to the point where you wouldn't even be able to keep both Brown and Tatum for instance.  Because what NBA teams are selling is not championships, it's simply *hope* of a championship.  And if you don't have at least one of these guys you have no product.  And at the same time that washes away hopes of building through the draft because while you could still compile 2-3 stars that way, you couldn't keep them all beyond their rookie contracts.  You're talking about a one year window before you have to start making choices.  Who would even bother with that.  And meanwhile the NY/LA teams as well as GSW, Chicago, and Miami not only have their pick of the truly elite superstars, but they get all the ring chasers too.   Some stars might take significant discounts to go there because basketball stars are so much more recognizable than football stars and fans are concentrated so much more in cities - they have much more to gain financially in a big market than a football player does.  You couldn't hope to maintain a roster like Boston has now, or one like Phoenix or Utah has.    Not when Vlade is around to offer $250m over four years to Jaylen Brown or DeAndre Ayton or Donovan Mitchell because he busted his last three picks or whatever.  No way."
"Paul George finally started playing well since game 3 of the Utah Series. And I give you that he is a better defender then Donovan but Paul George's defense is vastly overrated. If he is this amazing defender, why did he not take on the challenge of guarding Luka or Donovan? They torched the clippers. He used to be a great defender in Indy but regressed since then.   He is a secondary option which there is nothing wrong with.Donovan Mitchell is a first option on the number 1 team, that's the difference."
PG has never scored below 20 this run actually  He is averaging 26 on 60% TS so you clearly did not watch him play if you think he's bad rn. He has hit the 30 point mark in the last 3 games and is one of the best perimeter defenders in the league while Mitchell sucks ass in that area  He had one bad playoff run. He is not worse than Donovan Mitchell
Donovan Mitchell will be crucified when he has a bad shooting series. I can already feel him being the next target of the 'hero ball' narrative.
People (includin a lotta folks on r/nba) woulda made some stereotypes &amp; blamed it on his dad walking out or his upbringing or some psychoanalytical shit.   I remember when Shaq said he didn't believe in Donovan Mitchell and some of the nerds here went on to say it's because he had a deadbeat druggie dad &amp; was a troubled child growing up or some insane shit... and it got upvoted.  With the way people talk about LeBron it would be worse.
"That's a little harsh.  Plenty of smaller teams have kept their stars so far (and I say ""so far"" not as a contradiction, but as acknowledgment of the reality that most stars will move teams eventually):  Donovan Mitchell, Dame Lilliard, Lebron going back to Cleveland, KAT, Giannis, Memphis keeping Gasol and Conley until they all mutually agreed to part ways, Westbrook with OKC, even Paul George with OKC, San Antonio and their big 3 for like 15 years, Kemba leaving because the team wouldn't pay him, etc.  Many many small markets can and have been able to keep their players for a good run, or be the one to get rid of them through trades or refusing to offer the max.  Don't make it like small market teams are always victims of big markets, it goes both ways plenty of times.  There is zero issue here with Zion, the Pelicans aren't a good team and didn't make good moves as people have stated.  This is on them entirely, not the size of their city."
"There was a play that I remember vividly, Gobert was in the paint and had Pat Bev fronting him. TOSS HIM THE BALL!! I love Pat Bev and his defensive attitude but he‚Äôs 6ft flat, Gobert is 7ft minimum. I don‚Äôt think all of the blame is Gobert, I think we have to be honest that Donovan needs  to get him involved more especially if he‚Äôs going to be injured. That‚Äôs my only gripe about Mitchell and maybe I don‚Äôt watch enough Jazz ball but he‚Äôs gotta work on less ISO ball and more team ball. There at the end he was just chucking shots and they were ugly. Bogie had it going, I know you wanna be ‚Äúthat‚Äù guy when the games on the line but you gotta have Iq and realize ‚ÄúI‚Äôm injured, let me get the ball to the hot hand‚Äù."
"Yeah, but that doesn't really matter when their offense is so limited with no Conley and a hurt Donovan Mitchell."
"There's also lots of guys who get better at shooting that you don't even think about anymore as bad shooters. Ja Morant, Donovan Mitchell, LeBron, Jimmy Butler, Siakam, Kawhi, etc."
"&gt;Look, I've played sports, I've played injured. You're basically punishing this guy because he went superhuman for a few game while hurt, and couldn't keep playing at that extraordinary level.  I'm not punishing him. He's been hurt since the end of the regular season. He's been extraordinary while hurt. Disagreeing with the statement, I still acknowledge he's hurt. I just don't agree with putting that narrative out there, making it sound like the ankle was a primary issue of why they lost. It wasn't.  &gt;That's not a Donovan Mitchell problem. That a problem with your expectations.  That's plausible. I don't have too much of an ego to admit it's just my opinion on the matter. He could like you said just be answering it honestly."
"&gt; and in all 3 of those games, he scored 30 plus points and was reigning bombs from everywhere.  Look, I've played sports, I've played injured.  You're basically punishing this guy because he went superhuman for a few game while hurt, and then couldn't keep playing at that extraordinary level as the injuries continued to wear him down.  That's not a Donovan Mitchell problem.  That a problem with your expectations."
"I'm sure Donovan Mitchell doesn't give a shit what MrPeligro on r/nba says about his injury. I don't go personally attack mitchell. I'm not blowing up his social media saying he's making excuses. I'm on an internet forum sharing my opinion. Feel free to disagree with it. I'm not attacking anyone who feels different than my views.   It is what it is. This only came up this game. Had they won, I think he would have downplayed the injury, but I can admit that's pure speculation on my part.   I think he's going to bring it game 6 and leave it all on the floor. I don't expect the ankle to deter him from getting 30 plus points game 6."
Donovan Mitchell does this.
"Even with half of the all stars in the West out Utah still isn't going to make the WCF...     Donovan Mitchell, where the fuck were you tonight?"
You clearly aren't watching these games if you think Donovan Mitchell is a playoff choker. He has been the best player for the Jazz in this series. The only reason he did bad was because of his ankle which is getting worse and worse every game.
I can give the Jazz a pass Donovan Mitchell is banged up and Conley is still out.
"Donovan Mitchell isn‚Äôt a true superstar.   The Jazz would be the same (for the most part) if they replaced Mitchell with Booker, Lavine, Beal, and other high scoring guards."
Rookie of the year should have went to Donovan Mitchell
maybe not Donovan mitchell but all the healthy ones
"Jordan was waaaay quicker and more explosive than kawhi. Even 2nd 3 peat MJ. He was also a better finisher at the rim and had more creativity and versatility.  More hangtime, body control etc. Also MJ had way more stamina and consistently went all out on both ends whereas Kawhi now saves his energy on D most of the time (except crucial moments).  Same can be said for Kobe but to a lesser degree than MJ.   But ya Kawhi‚Äôs midrange game and pure jumper is very similar to MJ.    Just goes to show how insane MJ was. Kawhi with Westbrook‚Äôs athleticism lol. Or second 3 peat was Kawhi with Donovan Mitchell athleticism."
"I don't get this story, never will. What are you expecting him to become in the playoffs? Something different? He doesn't score much but he does it efficiently.   And the truth is he's never going to raise his scoring average in a playoff season because a) pace gets a little slower and b) Donovan Mitchell is one of those guys who thinks he needs to put a cape on and take 26 shots per game in the playoffs.   So your expectations are just wayyy off."
"Donovan Mitchell needs to stop being a ball hog and forcing shots when it‚Äôs not his night. Other players were having good nights, but Mitchell kept taking stupid shots until the end. If I was Snyder, I would call that out. Hero ball has no place in the playoffs."
"‚ÄúDonovan Mitchell with consecutive bricks from 3 at the final moment. Epic meltdown! Exactly like the phony GOAT back in 2011 against the Mavs. Speaking of bricking 3s, that brings me back to how Lebron LeBricked his 3 against the Spurs and how Ray Allen saved his legacy.‚Äù"
donovan mitchell is a cutie
Guess Donovan Mitchell is 2nd on your list he's also been insane in the playoffs
I would legitimately have Donovan Mitchell on my team on offense over Giannis which is a problem.  His defense saves him but its not like the Bucks are using it against KD lmao rather just watch him sauce Jrue and PJ all series
In the playoffs would you guys rather have Giannis or Donovan Mitchell?
Donovan Mitchell isn‚Äôt a superstar according to this sub so I‚Äôll take him.
"Donovan Mitchell  This sub won't call him a superstar yet, so I'm gonna take advantage."
"&gt;I'm honestly just shocked your guys FO haven't made much moves to improve in that area in the past few years, as you guys get a winning record every single year and have one of the best players in the league(my personal favorite non-Sun), I really think you guys would easily be serious contenders if you just moved the balance a little bit further towards being a 2 way team. Even ""average"" defense would make you guys so damn good...  Believe me, I have a lot of animosity towards Neil Olshey right now. The only really good move he's made was to bring in Nurk. Single handedly saved our season that year and probably saved NO's job. Otherwise, his roster construction sucks. I mean... Dame wanted us to draft Donovan Mitchell, and instead we go for Biggie Swanigan and Zach Collins. Imagine how deadly our team would be if we had Mitchell as Dame's #2."
1. Luka  2. Tatum  3. Zion  4. Donovan Mitchell  5. DeAndre Ayton
"I love Donovan and I draft him everyone cuz his ironman status. But he is one dimensional. Luka, Tatum, Zion, Mitchell, trae"
"&gt; The national basketball team for Yugoslavia if it still existed would be nuts and could 100% take down Team USA.  I think 100% beating Team USA is hyperbolic unless they're playing the same 2019 roster, in this hypothetical scenario, which included: Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Joe Harris, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Donovan Mitchell, Mason Plumlee, Marcus Smart, Jayson Tatum, Myles Turner, Kemba Walker, Derrick White.  That being said, a Yugoslavian team would wreck shop."
Donovan Mitchell is better this playoffs.
It‚Äôs Donovan Mitchell. The guy who can actually shoot 3s and FTs &gt; the guy who just dominates in the paint
"The gap between the team the US put out two years ago and its best team is massive. If the US actually sent their best players, you're looking at something like:  Steph curry, LeBron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, Draymond Green, and DeAndre Ayton.   The team that they actually sent was:  Marcus smart, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen brown, Harrison Barnes, Derrick white, Mason plumlee, Khris Middleton, Kemba walker, Joe Harris, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, and Donovan Mitchell."
"ESPN | Donovan Mitchell says playoffs is more intense and exciting without Lebron, Steph"
I would guess maybe because of Donovan Mitchell. He looks unreal right now
"&gt; There are 5-6 horrendous teams rn and we're gonna add two more  It is because they teams are unlucky with the lottery.   The Suns were in the absolutely dog house since Nash and Amare and now they are many people's favorites to win the west.   Also, look at the history of the Warriors. Before their run, they were the worst run franchise in the league. Literally god awful. The 90's and early 00's are a time that Warriors fans would like to pretend that didn't happen.   This issue in the modern NBA RN are these super teams, but I think it may change in the future with owner union negotiations or teams like Phoenix, Utah, Denver, Atlanta, Memphis, Dallas winning more.   If you have one star that can create his own shot and then you build a team around him and pay him very well, then it may be better than the alternative of having to fight with another star for notoriety.   Using Dallas as an example. KP may have been better off in New York and having the team build around him than going to Dallas and becoming a role player next to Luca.   Paul George as another example. He was the man in Indiana. Then he went to OKC and had a constant fight with Westbrook to who was the first option. Westbrook who is amazing btw, dominated the ball at times so that PG would struggle getting in the rhythm. There were times where PG would be ready to take over and Westbrook would attack rather than feed PG the ball. There were times where PG wanted to get himself going much to the displeasure of Westbrook. Now with the Clippers it is much of the same thing on occasion. Where if Kahwi has it going, he just watches. The point is if he had stayed in Indiana, it would have been his team. He would have been the No.1 option and they would have put pieces in place to predicate his success.   Look at what Phoenix did with Booker. It would be crazy for him to go somewhere else and play with another star where the offense is not centered around him. You can say the same thing about Donovan Mitchell. The Team is committed to them and will allow them to take shots that on another team with a star they would not be able too."
"I mean the Clippers and Lakers both had 2 stars everyone would have probably put above Donovan and Gobert.   Lebron/AD&gt;Kawhi/PG&gt; Mitchell/Gobert  doubting their success wasn‚Äôt unreasonable at all.   Actually seeing things play out will be interesting though because after how close we(Mavs) played the Clippers, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll beat the Jazz at all.   The took advantage of our lack of rim protection and top heavy team‚Äî Utah has the best rim protector playing, and they‚Äôre deep as hell."
"Ben Simmons was injured for all of what would have been the ""conventional"" rookie season (the season after your draft class), so he did not play a single game until the next season (making that his first). That season, Donovan Mitchell (from that year's draft class) was the best player of that class for RotY, but Ben was the front runner for the award since he was still a rookie due to it being his first season of playing time. Some fans saw this as him being a ""fake rookie"" since he'd had a year in the league‚Äîalbeit one where he never played. Blake Griffin had a similar situation, winning his RotY award with the next draft class since he'd blown his knee out before what would've been his first year in the league.  Not sure if this makes total sense, but should give you an idea of why it's a big joke."
Idk man Donovan Mitchell put in a good effort this year I think he could take it away!
Pat Bev and Donovan Mitchell are the same height. Mitchell looks taller because he‚Äôs more built but I was surprised by that.
"John Stockton, Donovan Mitchell, Dame Lillard, Steph Curry"
"Because of the change in their advanced metrics compared to the regular season, &amp; the obvious eye test.  In the playoffs, ESPECIALLY against good teams goberts WS/48, OBPM, DBPM, and Vorp tank.  I don‚Äôt care about advanced stats that much, but that‚Äôs what people use to prop him up so much.  Donovan Mitchell has so clearly been more crucial to them winning in the playoffs I just don‚Äôt see what people on Reddit are seeing."
&gt; He's on the same level as Donovan Mitchell  No he isn't
"Because he was guarding Donovan Mitchell. In your infinite wisdom would you rather have your best defender on Jordan Clarkson or Donovan Mitchell? ....Yea I thought so.  Btw Mitchell finished the night 9-24, 2-8 from 3 and 24 points in 35 minutes of play. Those numbers are below his average on the season. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Probably! Per basketball-reference, the Jazz that year had the 3rd best Off Rtg in the entire league (behind the Suns/Mavericks) but only the 18th best DefRtg. Adding a multiple-time DPOY contender to that team immediately fixes its biggest hole, while adding to its already excellent strengths by giving Deron Williams a secondary ball-handler and crunch time scoring threat in Donovan Mitchell. Not to mention they were super young - at 25.9 average years of age, they're  the youngest team in the top 10 teams with most wins that season. I'd say when you give a young, talented team those two players, you create a title contender for years to come."
"Isn't it weird that you can't find Donovan Mitchell anywhere? I thought if they could choose, he's the guy to give Gobert the award speech."
Honestly I'm here to see Donovan Mitchell gave Gobert blessings to confirm the past is really past. But I failed to find him.
"Current: Donovan Mitchell, Jimmy Butler All time: Kobe"
People really underrate Murray around here. He's on the same level as Donovan Mitchell so just imagine adding Donovan to this team.
Donovan Mitchell
"Im sure he can but Donovan Mitchell is so good, and it goes the other way for Donovan too"
Don‚Äôt sell yourselves short! They also drafted Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert.
"Kyrie, Devon Booker, Donovan Mitchell, and either Trae Young or Jayson Tatum even though their resumes are short"
"&gt; CP3 + Booker vs Conley and Mitchell  That's going to be a major factor, tbh.  CP3 &amp; Conley (and to a lesser extent Donovan) have both had significant injury issues this postseason.  Whether or not they're healthy may be a huge factor in a potential series."
Donovan Mitchell.
"As of right now, Donovan mitchell has the 2nd best odds to win FMVP this season"
"I get this sub still has a hate boner for Pascal, but come on man. Bam at 29 and Jimmy above fucking Paul George and Donovan Mitchell is the definition of wrong after how badly the Heat stunk it up in the playoffs this year."
"He has had a close relationship with Donovan Mitchell for several years. They think of each other as brothers.     He became friends with Jazz owner Ryan Smith several years ago. When Smith bought the team this year, they started talking.     And then if you are DWade, a man with a trans child, and a big desire to use your fame and platform for positive social change, what better place to go to try to take your message to people who desperately need to hear it? It's a franchise with extremely talented young stars, that's competing for rings right now, and you already have existing personal relationships with the owner and star guard.     If you look past the surface of the story, it would be crazy for him NOT to do it."
For Donovan Mitchell: Luke Kennard  Absolutely shut him down in the second half yesterday
"Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker are doing what they can to make sure the casuals know their names, too. These two are both superstars, already."
Why not Devin Booker or Donovan Mitchell? Booker in particular has the most star power in the NBA (on Twitch).
"Mitchell was better in game 1, but Rudy was better all season (and the Memphis series btw). We stagger Gobert and Mitchell so we run units with just one almost every game. The Rudy but no Donovan units were fantastic while the Donovan but no Rudy units were average at best. Gobert had an on/off of 19.1 this year, which was best in the league. Donovan was -3.2, but it‚Äôs not like we were bad with him on, +8.0 with Mitchell on and +11.2 with him off. +8 would‚Äôve still been good enough for best team net rating in the league."
Because a lot of them don't care until it personally affects them. But give props to the people who did say something.  Donovan Mitchell was one of them .
"I mean, +5% on FG% is pretty substantial and Book has a better TS% as well. Book also has a much more diverse shot selection, which is particularly impressive given how effective he is in the midrange.  Donovan is a prolific driver and finisher with next level strength and athleticism, and Book has him beat in FG% in just about every zone but from beyond  the 3 point line.  I'm not a Jazz fan, but it's pretty clear that Donovan is the focal point of an extremely potent Jazz offense. When he get's going... my goodness, he just exploits his matchup and shreds a defense. It's really impressive and there's an argument to be made that Donovan's game is better suited for the the modern playstyle that favors athleticism and 3 point shooting.    With both guys, you kind of just have to pick and choose from their strengths and weaknesses. Outside of raw production, their profiles are very different. Mitchell is best with the ball in his hands and is elite from the two areas that matter most in the modern NBA - penetrating and shooting from 3. Book is a true three level scorer that is best when he's moving off-ball.  It's like a modern Kobe vs. DWade (I know, it's silly to compare two  young stars to all-time greats). Two very different players that are equally great, but in different ways."
Luka Booker and Donovan mitchell
"I mean, i think we‚Äôre fine, honestly, have kept teams down to 100-110 points per game? Haven‚Äôt been blown out of the water    And hell, there are going to be players who go off on you no matter how good of a rim protector you have, especially in the post season. You don‚Äôt live or die on whether or not Luka has a great game or not because there‚Äôs gonna be nights where it‚Äôs literally impossible. And Donovan Mitchell can be similarly unstoppable."
Ingles started at point guard last night.   Donovan Mitchell is listed at shooting guard.
"I love Donovan Mitchell, but never paid much attention tion to their coach. Can someone tell me what kind of coach he is?"
Donovan Mitchell
They've been on Mitchell for a while because his Dad works for the Mets and Donovan spends a lot of time in NY.
"For more hot takes, further down the draft class there's Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, OG Anunoby, and Kyle Kuzma"
"""Quote unquote"" superstar Donovan Mitchell"
"You're forgetting Donovan Mitchell, who has legit superstar potential. People don't talk about him as a star player, but he's dropping 40 every other night in the playoffs for a reason."
"&gt;Booker's 4th quarter FG% - **40.1** &gt;&gt;Mitchell's 4th quarter FG% - **39.8**  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/traditional/?sort=PTS&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PlayerPosition=G&amp;Period=4  Again, your focus on late scoring is bizarre especially when Booker is a hair more efficient at it. Where are you getting your numbers from..?   &gt;You‚Äôre all over the place w trying to prove that Booker is just as good as Mitchell in the playoffs in the second half.  You're literally lying about the difference in their ""struggles"" to make it sound like Booker can't hang in the 4th compared to Donovan, you must have known that Booker was more efficient in the 4th when you ran the numbers, but you decided to hold his overall superior efficiency against him when it dipped, despite **still** being higher than Mitchell's.   My only question is 'why'?"
Donovan Mitchell should‚Äôve been the spider  Makes too much sense and would‚Äôve been great marketing since he‚Äôs tearing it up in the playoffs
"Lol y‚Äôall were hating on him all season calling him overrated. He delivers when it counts. I remember a heavily updated post a few months back of someone back east finally watching a jazz game. Their conclusion was ‚ÄúGobert is the most underrated player in the league, and Donovan Mitchell is the most overrated‚Äù.  Y‚Äôall clapped like a bunch of seals."
I think Mitchell is criminally underrated. He doesn‚Äôt get talked about enough in the category with the Tatum‚Äôs and Booker‚Äôs of the world.   It‚Äôs close but I‚Äôd go with Mitchell. Donovan just has that IT factor and leadership about him that not a lot of young players have. Book is an amazing talent but really got to this stage when CP3 arrived. Definitely close though.
"It's ironic that this clip and post is about Donovan Mitchell and how he's focused on winning, putting in the effort himself and encouraging his teammates when he's not on the floor, and the commenter only sees the opposite."
"I had faith in you guys. The Jazz have the most well rounded team in the NBA. Excellent shooting and defense, a strong supporting cast, and Donovan Mitchell. Give them hell Jazz."
Donovan Mitchell is not a better passer/playmaker. He‚Äôs a better 3pt volume shooter and a more explosive athlete.
