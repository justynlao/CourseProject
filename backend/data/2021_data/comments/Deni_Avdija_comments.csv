"OP has ulterior motives.  He’s a delusional Deni Avdija fanboy that is salty the wizards offense runs through Beal and his boy therefore doesn’t touch the ball as much as he wishes he did.  What he refuses to admit is that Beal is BY FAR the best player on the team and justifiably the focal point.  Your kid is a rookie.  They’re not going to hand him the reins on day one.  Get that through your head, dumbass."
Deni Avdija is also Asian
"Potentially, yes. Are you going to pretend to know anything about Deni Avdija as a prospect, or can you give me some solid reasons why you think that's invalid.  It's easier for me to envision the Warriors contending with Deni than Wiseman, because Deni is a far more seasoned player right now who fits seamlessly into what the Warriors want to do in their flow, equal opportunity offense that relies upon instinctive on the fly reads. It will take him less time to adjust to a team that needs to win as soon as possible, with their core aging.  Another factor is, I think that so long as Draymond is in his prime he'll be a better center for GSW than Wiseman. Both a better defender and more important offensive player due to his passing , nnate chemistry with Steph.They'll want to close games with Draymond at C, as they have done throughout much of their dynastic run when games mattered most. If it gets to the point that Draymond can't do this at an elite level anymore, then I think the Warriors days as a contender are over for the foreseeable future *unless* Wiseman explodes as a prospect."
Xavier Tillman - 20.8 mpg  Deni Avdija - 23.2 mpg  Tyrese Halliburton - 28 mpg  Lamelo Ball - 25.2 mpg  Facundo Campazzo - 12.2 mpg
Ben Simmons and Deni Avdija would be fun
"I see no point even if wizards get a other good pick . They haven't been developing their players properly. Deni Avdija is not a spot up shooter, he can playmake, rebound and play good defense. Scott Brooks needs too go"
Precisely what I'm saying. I think it'd take Deni Avdija to make it work (I'd consider that significant)
Deni Avdija is criminally underused by the Wiz... Why did they even pick him
Sometimes writers like KOC zag when they should have zigged a little too much and their bold predictions look really bad. But it’s still early so I wouldn’t make any declarative statements on some of these rookies except that Deni Avdija is the greatest player to ever put on a jersey.
"Not looking for “significant confidence” on almost anything for these rookies. I’m firmly in the camp that thinks these rookies are screwed this year. If I can get 50 consecutive attempts that go good, then I’m not giving up on a guy. Killian Hayes looks out of sorts, but I’m not writing him off this year. Give the Pistons a real off-season and let him get used to NBA speed a little before we say he’s trash. I’m not seeing Anthony Bennett from him yet. I also don’t believe the Deni Avdija is going to be good yet either. Even the veterans might be off these first few weeks.  If he still looks good in week 5 and 6, then let’s talk about him being a serious asset."

"I haven't watched many Wizards games, but from what I've seen in the Bulls game aren't you guys under-utilizing Deni Avdija? It seems like he turned into a catch and shoot player, and I think he has potential to unlock other areas of his offense if given the chance."

I’m just here to watch Deni Avdija...
"Lol, I’ve watched like 3-4 Wizards games this year probably, I really don’t care if you’ve watched every game this season though.  Westbrook is doing the same thing he does on every team, dominate the ball and take volume shots, but he’s even more inefficient than ever before.  Having guys like Deni Avdija, who’s a point forward, sitting in the corner, for Russ to dominate the ball and shoot significantly below average is not winning basketball.  To address your last edit, Wiggins is literally 2nd option this year, idk what games you’ve been watching or who you would think he would be 3rd/4th behind? Lmao. How many Warriors games have you watched? Nuance is dead btw."
"Deni Avdija is a NBA basketball player who is giving his respects about the Holocaust. r/nba always posts about (rightfully so) social justice initiatives that players participate in, like BLM and pay equity.   You decided to derail the thread by posting about Israeli governmental action, which has nothing to do about the Holocaust. That is like in a post about BLM, writing about the heightened anti-LGBT culture within the Black Community. Again, learn to read the room."
"Deni is 20 years old and has a Gorani Muslim father. He's not the one pulling the trigger, and he was never even in the IDF by virtue of Israel's mandatory service laws (he got an exemption because of basketball).  Furthermore, Holocaust Remembrance Day is important to *all* Jews the world over. Avdija is the only Jewish NBA player I am aware of, and trying to tie his remembrance to crimes currently being committed in a country where most of the world's Jews don't even life is *very* antisemitic.  Nobody tries to claim that Furkan Korkmaz bears responsibility for the Turkish invasion of Northern Syria, or that Gorgui Dieng needs to answer for the actions of Islamic terror groups. So unless Deni starts publicly speaking in support of Israel's occupation, why does Deni need to answer for their actions? Deni may be Israeli, but here, Israel is irrelevant to the conversation."
"Do you want to know who are the guys which are even below Deni in this  VORP rank?  I will give you several names: Anthony Edwards, James Wiseman, Isaac Okoro  Patrick Williams, Killian Hayes aren't much higher than Avdija.  Basically all top-10 selected rookies playing big enough minutes per game except Lamelo...  Yes... send them all to G-League"
"D'Lo was a ""part of the future"" and they were ""blown away"" by Deni Avdija"
"I think 2020 will be Yam Madar. People who watch Israeli league like me probably agree. 6 foot 2 with a 7 foot 2 wingspan, very good jump shot, swarming defense, solid paint finishing ability. He’s a stand out player and he’s putting up the same stats Deni Avdija did last year. Hopefully he can make an immediate impact when he’s done with his stash year next season."
"I still don’t mind the Wiseman pick if we were staying at 2. LaMelo is great but he’d be redundant on our team. We’re not winning shit without Klay anyway.   That being said, I wear hoping we would trade down to like 8 and scoop someone young and solid like Wendell Carter. Then we still could’ve drafted Haliburton or Deni Avdija."
"Without looking at Google or the comments, can you name which player came from where?  #Wizards  * Rui Hachimura * Deni Avdija * Davis Bertans  * Robin Lopez * Raul Neto * Issac Bonga * Alex Len  #Mavs  * Luka Doncic * Tingus Pingus * Boban * Maxi Kleber * Willie Cauley-Stien * Dwight Powell * Nicolo Melli * Josh Green"
60. Deni Avdija
"1) Isaac Bonga (he is in the dog house)  2) Garrison Mathews  3) Jerome Robinson. Lol, he should be cut  4) Deni Avdija. Goofy looking European dandy who gets no respect from the refs and is oblivious to NBA foul drawing tricks as a rookie, and thus is much less effective than he should be    5) Raul Neto  6) Rui  ...  15) Davis Bertans"

Deni Avdija was mocked top three a ton
"Deni Avdija. I don’t know any others off the top of my head who are active, but there are a number of former players, like Omri Casspi, Jordan Farmar, Larry Brown. Sue Bird of the WNBA as well."
Deni Avdija is in Miami. Maybe he can go kick Meyers Leonard’s ass

Deni Avdija bouta drop 40 next time the Wizards play the Heat
Against Deni Avdija no less
yet there's still that asshole on twitter who swears they should've traded him so they could've selected *\*checks notes\** DENI AVDIJA
I'm a Nets fan and I'm angry too. As someone who believes in Deni Avdija heavily (and loves his story- I really just want him on the Raptors tbh) watching Scott Brooks minimize his strengths makes me want to throw something
It's a weekly ranking... **that takes the full season into account**. Let's say Deni Avdija scored 40 points 3 games in a row after being quiet the whole season. Is he #1 on the ROTY ladder all of a sudden?
"There is an interesting stat also. Two all time best slovenian players, Dončić and Dragić have serbian fathers and the all time best croatian, Petrović, and the israeli Deni Avdija they too have Serbian father.  You can argue Serbians across the world are spreading the basketball genes XDD"
"Basketball GM is the greatest look into the future of basketball. In my sim for example Gary Trent won MVP twice, Lebron played until 2028 and was still averaging 20 PPG, De'Anthony Melton made a few all star games and Deni Avdija won 8 rings while averaging 10 PPG in his prime."

Should I go on or do you need more sources?
"You guys really whiffed that Deni Avdija pick. He’s an excellent ball handler &amp; passer, but that’s the opposite of what you guys need at the wing. A guy like Saddiq Bey or Devin Vassell would have made this team so much better."
Fellow unbiased opinion  MVP - Bradley Beal  DPOY - What’s defense  6MOTY - Davis Bertans  MIP - Daniel Gafford  COTY - Russel Westbrook  ROTY - Anthony Gill maybe Deni Avdija
Deni Avdija is taller than Robert Williams
"Ja caught himself with his other foot tho, Avdija had no chance to save himself since he was already stumbling after trying to safely land twice and Deni is 6'9 210lbs vs Ja's 6'3 174lbs.  The replay of the injury doesn't do justice to how much pain Deni is in cus he kinda fell in slow motion but all that weight on 1 isolated part of the body that was already turned in an awkward position really isn't good."
"Avdija literally can't drive to his left. This notion that he is this point forward type of player who is being used incorrectly is complete fiction. Just noise from delusional Wizards homers/ Deni stans.   Avdija is an ok defender, but he can't do anything offensively and is getting playing time solely by virtue of being our 1st round pick and us having no NBA level options at SF."
The MVP ballot has 5 spots on it. Being put 3rd/4th/5th on the ballot doesn't necessarily mean you're in the conversation.  If they only gave 1 vote per person Chris Paul would probably finish tied with Deni Avdija in the MVP race.
Thanks I might cross post. My main concern w that sub is the Westbrook hate and love for John Wall. Pretty sure everyone else knows Westbrook is better than Wall.  Also there are so many Deni Avdija trolls on there claiming he's the next Luka and it's just shitty coaching. He's not that good lol even if you had Phil Jackson.
Are we talking about anthony edwards or deni avdija?
^(having a better statistical season than Deni Avdija last year but don’t let r/nba hear that)
Is Deni Avdija not from Israel?
"Honestly not too bad. He's only had one full offseason and season with the job so far.   In that time, the biggest trade was obviously the Wall-Westbrook trade which was a W for Washington. I think though that trade was a product of circumstance, John butting heads with our FO and WB wanting out of Houston was just a perfect storm. Either way good for us.  The trade to pick up Gafford from the Bulls mid season also seems like it's a pretty big W for Washington.  As for drafting, he's drafted Rui Hachimura and Deni Avdija. Rui is already a pretty solid player but has a lot of room to improve, and we didn't really get to see how good Deni can be because of how Brooks used him in his system and his injury. Overall though, I am pretty happy with these picks."
Deni Avdija probably doesn’t cancel that out.
"It’s not even a problem. I’d compare it to shooting on your toes like KD or Ray Allen, etc. it makes your shot faster but doesn’t increase accuracy, and in fact a lot of players taught to shoot without a dip have a lack of rhythm and continuity in their jumper, leading to less consistency: look at a lot of european guys like deni avdija.  Dipping your shot in rhythm with bending your knees leads to more accuracy and consistency."
"The best players often make shit coaches. Even more often they make shit general managers. So why are we still pretending that their opinion on the value of players is any good whatsoever. If Collin Sexton came out tomorrow and said Deni Avdija should've won rookie of the year, it would be just as dumb of a take as if anyone else said it."
I’d love if Deni Avdija does
"Yeah just like my Pistons (with better talent) they are gonna have to pick a direction : either really build around Russ &amp; Beal, try to get shooting, 3&amp;d talent.  Or try to developp Avdija, Rui, to a lower extent Bryant. Those 3 mainly arent a fit rn. Bryant sucks too much defensively, Deni and Rui need the ball a bit"
Nah dude Deni Avdija was their missing piece
Deni Avdija probably doesn’t have made a difference
"Embiid not coming back this series and the Wizards strategically using their entire roster, Deni Avdija included, to check into the game and foul Ben Simmons the second the Sixers get possession."
He's a players coach. The team likes him which has allowed him to stay way past his welcome. It also doesn't help that he let's Russ and Beal do whatever tf they want.   He was touted for his player development when he came here but has done nothing for Troy Brown Jr or Deni Avdija. Those two are playmaking 3s but are forced to become pure 3 pt shooters which they aren't. Because of that they don't produce and have a tight lease whenever they see the floor. Brooks does more harm than good when it comes to player development.
Wonder why didn't the warriors draft deni avdija
I really thought I got it between Bill Russell and Deni Avdija lol
There are 8 between Deni Avdija and Ossie Schectman
Suns select Deni Avdija is perfet for this team
"Visit Dongbei real quick and everybody there is 6'4 easily. Chinese people not making the NBA is for a geopolitical reason only. Why pull in better players like Guo Ailun or Ding YangYuHang when you have Yuta Watanabe? It's just political. Why develop Zhou Qi when you could develop Aleksej Poku? Why develop WangZheLin when you could develop Rui Hachimura? Why spend money and marketing having a Chinese face on your american team when the system is currently trying to push yellow peril ? Why develop Abadushalmu Abudurexiti when you could have Deni Avdija? There are CBA young studs like Kevin Zhang and Fanbo Zeng that could make it here too.   What do i mean political? The idea is that making the NBA is also part luck. With 30 teams, 13 roster slots, you can only put so many people on your team. You have to give somebody a chance, bc one roster spot has 1000 hopeful people trying to get on. Not only are you vying for that super competitive spot, if you also come from the country that they don't really like and have beef with, they're not gonna ""help you out"" and give you that opportunity."
"There is absolutely no way I am taking RJ Hampton over Deni Avdija. Deni is the youngest player in the class and has been utilized in a really poor way by Brooks. Isaiah Stewart should also be above Hampton, he's been excellent this season.  Definitely would take Quickley over Okoro/Poku. He's shown way too much as a contributor on a playoff team already. Also probably a couple guys to take over Nwora including Jae'Sean Tate and Saben Lee"
Who’s better ? Him or Deni Avdija
"Just this Year? Obi Toppin. I expected so much from him. But he's only played 11mpg, so cant really criticize when your coach dont play ya.  Cant really criticize Jalen Smith for the same reason, he wasnt given minutes behind a very very very deep bench.  But the award goes to the rookie that actually got minutes and disappointment goes to Killian Hayes and Deni Avdija"
A better version of this list  1 Timberwolves select Anthony Edwards  2 Warriors select Lamelo Ball  3 Hornets select Tyrese Haliburton  4 Bulls select Patrick Williams  5 Cavs select Isaac Okoro  6 Hawks select Killian Hayes  7 Pistons select Devin Vassell  8 Knicks select James Wiseman  9 Wizards select Onyeka Okongwu (honestly Wiseman and Okongwu could go either way)  10 Suns select Deni Avdija  11 Spurs select Aaron Nesmith  12 Kings select Kira Lewis Jr  13 Pelicans select Obi Toppin  14 Celtics select Jalen Smith
Deni avdija
I said I was looking for an american who did what rubio did but yeah it’s not worded very well lol. deni avdija doesn’t fit my criteria because he played for the wizards right after he was drafted. also he’s not american
Breakout - Deni Avdija  Regresses - Julius Randle
One of wizards player Deni Avdija”s jerseys would say District 9 so I’m pretty alright with that
"1. Usage - players that play more and make more explosive movements are more likely to get hurt 2. Exposure - you're more likely to hear about a star player getting hurt, even if it happens at the same rate as role players  For the Wizards, people talked about Russ getting healthy all season, while ignoring that we had lost Thomas Bryant, Deni Avdija, and (for stretches) Rui Hachimura"
So was deni avdija
"Deni Avdija, the israeli rookie."
Deni Avdija and a Denny's.

Deni avdija has a chance to prove he is Jewish luka
Deni Avdija. He might get touches
Deni Avdija.
"It’s almost like he was a raw 19 year old thrown into a major role on a team that was trying to contend. Yes he was worse last year than people expected, but it was obvious he wasn’t gonna be NBA ready yet and you’re also basing everything about him off of a measly *39* game sample (and ignoring the fact that his last 5 or so games showed strong improvement before he got hurt). Either way, him being a project wouldn’t dissuade bad/rebuilding teams from trading for him.  I mean, Deni Avdija played 15 more games than Wiseman last year and already had way more professional basketball experience to begin with, and he was pretty terrible last year. Are you writing him off already?"
for Deni Avdija
"Trez/Kuz (or Rui - whichever comes off bench)/Deni Avdija/KCP/A. Holiday is a nice one, but it was just assembled so we're not sure how they'll gel.  On paper though, I'm a fan of that lineup as a bench 5. Then Neto &amp; Corey Kispert as the deep benchers."
Carmelo Anthony (always felt like his name sounded like butter)   Deni Avdija   Saddiq Bey  Facundo Campazzo  Ricky Rubio
"Couple things I’d love to address here.   1) the rumors are that Halliburton was telling teams not to pick him so he could go to Sacramento  2) Killian Hayes, Deni Avdija, *Jalen Smith*, and Devin Vassell were also picked in front of him, I’m not sure why obi and the Knicks are being singled out"
rui hachimura and deni avdija for kevin durant and kyrie irving and jim harden. who says no?
"&gt; In other words, they wanted 2019 first-round pick Rui Hachimura or 2020 first-rounder Deni Avdija, a request that inspired a swift “no” in response from the Wizards.  Oof. Well, can't blame a team for shooting their shot."
"I want people to know that Justin Kutcher calls Deni Avdija the ""Wizraeli"" because that nickname sucks and I hate Kutcher"
They have Deni Avdija too
"I'm going to go with two guys who I loved going into the draft, but had somewhat disappointing seasons partly due to some stuff not entirely within their control: Deni Avdija and Tyrell Terry."
Killian Hayes and Deni Avdija I think
"Deni Avdija, Payton Pritchard, and Isaiah Stewart could also be borderline Allstars down the line"
"So you’re including teams where the player hadn’t won MVP yet?   Then the 2021 Washington Wizards, with future MVPs Bradley Beal, Deni Avdija and Daniel Gafford."
"Shortly after the Washington Wizards’ season ended with a first-round playoff loss, general manager Tommy Sheppard dropped a hint of what was to come.  “This is not a run-it-back team,” he said.  Now, it’s official. Changes are arriving. Big ones.  Just before Thursday’s NBA Draft, the Wizards and Lakers agreed to a deal that will send Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles for Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell and the No. 22 pick, sources told The Athletic. Washington also will route a 2024 and a 2028 second-round pick to L.A. The swap won’t become official until the start of free agency on Aug. 6.  As Bradley Beal spent the last few weeks mulling his future with the organization, as The Athletic previously reported, Westbrook also was deciding his own. The former MVP, who is from the L.A. area, spent parts of the offseason discussing the possibility of teaming up with four-time champion LeBron James and eight-time All-Star Anthony Davis. Westbrook had a growing desire to join James and Davis in Los Angeles to compete for a championship, sources said. He formally informed the Wizards of his desires recently, according to sources: if they could find a trade that works, Westbrook wanted to go to the Lakers.  They landed on one.  Washington executed the deal with no issues from Beal, per sources. The three-time All-Star, who is entering the final season of his contract, has expressed no desire to leave the Wizards, according to sources. As speculation about his future has swirled, the team remains confident it can keep him for the long term. The Wizards can offer him a four-year, $180 million extension in October, but if he waits until 2022 free agency, he can sign a five-year contract for an estimated $235 million to return to Washington.  One of the main reasons Westbrook wanted to come to D.C. when the Wizards traded John Wall for him in December was the presence of head coach Scott Brooks, who coached the former MVP from 2008-15 in Oklahoma City. But the Wizards did not retain Brooks when his contract expired at the end of the 2020-21 season despite Westbrook’s outspoken recommendation that they should.  Westbrook preferred a more established coach to replace Brooks, according to sources. The Wizards eventually hired former Nuggets assistant Wes Unseld Jr., whose résumé includes 16 years as an NBA assistant and eight more as an advance scout.  The Lakers set an offseason goal to acquire an elite playmaker next to James and Davis. They deemed Westbrook worthy. He averaged a triple-double during his one season in D.C., the fourth time in five years he’s done so. Many in the Wizards organization praised him for how he changed the team’s culture and work ethic. He will turn 33 years old at the start of next season and has two years and $91 million remaining on his contract.  The Wizards believe the package from the Lakers improves their depth. They view Caldwell-Pope, one of Beal’s closest friends in the league and the type of player they have sought after for years, as their next starting small forward. Washington went into the offseason hoping to improve its defense and long-range shooting. Caldwell-Pope can guard the perimeter physically and is versatile. He sank 41 percent of his 3-point attempts last year.  He will reposition 2020 first-round pick Deni Avdija to the bench, the Wizards’ preferred spot for the 20-year-old as he returns from a fractured fibula.  The trade gives Washington more roster flexibility, too. Westbrook has a couple of seasons remaining on a supermax contract. Breaking his deal into three middling ones could make it easier for the Wizards to pull off trades for more reasonable salaries.  Harrell is only one year removed from winning NBA Sixth Man of the Year and averaged 13.5 points per game for the Lakers last season, but he fell out of their rotation during the playoffs. Kuzma has improved as a defender and shot 36 percent from beyond the 3-point arc in 2020-21. Both create redundancies on what’s now an imbalanced roster.  Renovations are coming — especially at point guard, where the team has an obvious, Westbrook-sized hole.  Sources say to keep an eye on 28-year-old free agent Spencer Dinwiddie, who missed most of last season with a torn ACL but averaged 20.6 points per game in 2019-20. The Wizards are above the salary cap but could try to negotiate a sign-and-trade with Dinwiddie’s incumbent team, the Nets. The other pieces from the Westbrook trade, Harrell and Kuzma alone, would not be enough for Brooklyn to accept a Dinwiddie deal, according to a source. Dinwiddie is expected to receive interest from several teams, including the Nets, Knicks, Heat and Raptors, sources said.  The Wizards made a smaller move for a point guard Thursday, flipping the No. 22 pick, which they received in the Westbrook trade, to the Pacers for fourth-year guard Aaron Holiday and No. 31, which netted them 19-year-old stretch 4 Isaiah Todd. Washington grew enamored with Holiday when he worked out for them before the 2018 draft and actually tried to trade for him a year ago.  That wasn’t all. The Wizards’ Thursday night also included selecting 22-year-old sharpshooter Corey Kispert with the No. 15 pick, which gives them another 3-point threat. Kispert, who made 44 percent of his long-range attempts last season at Gonzaga, was the top shooter on the Wizards’ list and No. 10 on their draft big board, a source said. Sheppard mentioned in a news conference that the Wizards explored trading up for him before taking him 15th.  Washington is now capable of loading lineups with shooters, something it seriously struggled with in 2020-21 when it neither made nor took many 3-pointers. It finished 23rd in 3-point percentage and 29th in 3-point rate (the percentage of their field-goal attempts that came from beyond the arc). Now, it can piece together units with Beal, Kispert, Davis Bertans, Thomas Bryant and whomever it has at point guard. Caldwell-Pope will fit in there, too. The Wizards now have 3-point menaces.  If Dinwiddie does not end up in D.C., options remain. This summer’s free agency class is rich with capable point guards — from top-flight ones (who are not realistic for Washington), like Chris Paul, Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry to more reasonably-priced ones, like Reggie Jackson, Patty Mills, Cameron Payne and Devonte’ Graham, amongst others. A reunion with free-agent Raul Neto, who spot-started for the Wizards last season, is a possibility, sources say.  They can use the mid-level exception, worth up to $9.5 million, to sign free agents. The Westbrook and Holiday trades, which shave more than $5 million from their payroll, give them extra room to operate below the luxury tax line. They also created an $8.5 million trade exception in the Westbrook deal, which they can use to trade for a player who makes up to $8.6 million (yes, it’s confusing, but that’s not a typo) without having to match salaries in the exchange.  For now, the roster is unbalanced. But moves are coming. Teams can begin speaking to free agents on Aug. 2.  The Wizards have 15 players under contract. But with Westbrook gone and both Neto and Ish Smith hitting free agency, they have only one point guard in Holiday, a 24-year-old who was a backup in Indiana last season and projects to hold a similar role in 2021-22.  They have a logjam of 3/4 types. Rui Hachimura, Avdija, Bertans, Kuzma and Chandler Hutchison all overlap in some way or another. Kispert could fit into this player type, too. They’re adding the second-rounder Todd to the mix too. Power forward Anthony Gill and wing Caleb Homesley are under contract but are non-guaranteed for 2021-22.  They have another crowd at center with three players who warrant playing time: Bryant, Harrell and Daniel Gafford — though Bryant will miss the beginning of the season as he continues to recover from the ACL he ruptured in January. The Wizards hope he can return by December, according to a source, though it’s difficult to lock in a specific return time this far out.  But this is not what the roster will look like at the start of the season. The Wizards, after all, were not a run-it-back team. And now, they are officially not running it back."
IT'S BECAUSE YOU NEED TO SHOOT BASKETS TO GET POINTS. BEAL COULD ONLY TAKE SO MANY SHOTS AND MY BOIS RUI HACHIMURA AND DENI AVDIJA AREN'T PRIMED TO TAKE OVER THE LEAGUE JUST YET. WESTBROOK'S VOLUME WILL GO DOWN BUT SHOT PERCENTAGE WILL GO UP. AD AND LEBRON ARE GOING TO BE ON THREE POINT LINES LEAVING CLEAR LANES FOR RUSSELL TO HIT THE PAINT. OR IMAGINE AD OR LEBRON CUTTING TO THE RIM? IMAGINE WB CUTTING TO THE RIM FROM A LB PASS? LEAGUES DONE.
"With Deni Avdija on the Wizards, that ain’t looking too good for him"
"I think the Deni Avdija, Alex Len, Rui Hachimura frontcourt from the wizards was comparable"
"their best package involves punting their draft picks for the next few years and some team being very high on Deni Avdija or Rui.   They can easily throw together something like what Milwaukee gave for Jrue- but it requires unprotecting their 2023 1st owed to Houston. If Houston agrees to do that (no reason for them not to)   #15, 2025 1st, swap in 2024, along with Bertans (negative value), plus one of Deni or Rui, and Bryant (positive value) should easily be enough to get a 3rd banana quasi-star to run with Russ and Beal, preferably a frontcourt guy. Will they win a title like that? Probably not, but it makes them good, at a minimum. They will be pretty desperate for depth though."
Ready for Rui Hachimura to take the next step as a scorer and for Deni Avdija to show his skills with the ball.
"If it is, it's because the media led people to believe that players aren't shit unless they get rings, and fans followed. So now, surprise surprise, you can't just be a good or great player.  I'm a Wizards fan (your condolences, I'm sure) and it's nonstop ""Beal should leave! We should trade Beal!"" meanwhile the guy has gotten better and better every year and is adamant about staying in DC and building the team and making it better.    And all you get is people clamoring for him to leave, clamoring for the Wizards to trade him from outside or inside, and even beating their chest about how they wanted to trade the franchise's best player years ago.  Media pushed this narrative and fans have swallowed it hook, line and sinker.    So what do players want to do? Go to a team and win a title, because all fans are doing is pushing their team's best players out the door for some unknown future with 'draft picks' and capital.    Like the Wizards have a budding young star, Beal in his prime, a talented point guard coming from a contender in DinWiddie, and other pieces in Kuzma, Trezz &amp; last year's #9 pick Deni Avdija, and you see Wizards fans pointing to like the damn Orlando Magic and OKC as teams that are in a better position.    Fans did this shit.  Media started it, fans gobbled it up, and here we are. Fans would rather have a trash roster and win 3 games because then they'll get a high draft pick who they then think maybe can find a way to sit out again and tank some more, and waste another year, and get another high pick.  It's the dumbest shit ever. That's the real joke."
[Highlight] Deni Avdija with the dagger to eliminate the 1st seed Nets in the first round
Deni Avdija baby! Given we make up .2% of the world population I think we actually are adequately represented in the NBA
"This season Marcus Smart is averaging 7 3PA a game and is making them at....(wait for it..) 23.5%  Why in gods name is Smart taking so many threes. Also if Tatum is awful the Celtics suck.   This game was a difference in depth. Tatum and Beal were both trash but the Wiz have too much depth. JB was also really bad this game.   The Celtics last guy on the rotation is a washed Jabari Parker, Grant Williams, Josh Richardson compared to the Wiz who are running the rookie Corey Kispert who actually looks really solid so far on both ends of the court, Deni Avdija who also plays solid D and can ball handle, Aaron Holiday who is looking like a steal of a pick-up for PG depth and Bertans who is still capable of being a good NBA player even though he's been pretty bad at doing what he's paid to do which is shoot the ball. Juancho needs to work his way into the rotation for Boston, he's a solid player."
I thought Josh Giddey would just be a Deni Avdija. Oops. Could be a legit star
"contending teams no, lottery teams yes. The wizards with deni avdija come to mind."
"I don't know if you know this, but Deni Avdija and Daniel Gafford have been seen as the greatest duo in NBA history by those of us smart enough to see it"
Same thing is happening to Deni Avdija in Washington
Deni avdija too right?
"Gafford and Avdija should provide some good defense. And Gafford is better than Harrell offensively imo.   But yeah, even with positive defensive contributors (Gaff, Deni, KCP, Kuz, Rui), defense will still be a major issue for us. Hopefully a defensive minded coach in Wes Unseld Jr can help turn things around. Lord knows Scott Brooks wasn't helping one bit in improving the defense"
Deni Avdija -- his team just got Kuzma
"Yes, Deni Avdija. Grabbed his coffee and told me have a nice day—Sweetheart."
"It’s unbelievable, but this happens every year. I remember Deni Avdija (nothing against the guy) had a good preseason debut last year, and all of the comments were calling him the ROTY and lamenting how stupid everyone was for not taking him in the top 5"
"Maybe 12 of us.  But since you asked, here goes  While Russ did do a drag job last season, him and Beal alone with basically no depth can’t get us past the first round.  Especially not from the play-in.  So we got out of Russ contract and got KCP, Kuz, and Trez back.  Plus with other moves In this same deal, we turned the 22nd pick and a 2024 second round pick into Aaron Holiday and Dinwiddie.  Which is a solid haul for one getting out of that contract which made no sense for our team right now, and getting some young talent or trade filler later depending how this coming season goes.   So if we boil that down, we got out of the Wall contract from 2 years ago, and turned it into what I list.  We fired Scott Brooks and hired Wes Unseld Jr.  Who is a great young first time coach ready to get to work.  Had a pretty decent draft and We are getting Thomas Bryant and Deni Avdija back from injury plus re-signed Raul Neto.  We still have Beals decision hanging out there but something will happen with that soon.   So yea I’d say the Wizards got better this off season."

Deni avdija on the wizards
"I think Deni Avdija has the potential to be top 5. The Westbrook trade will help him, Brooks completely misused him last season. His potential is super high"
"I'm kind of invested in Deni Avdija because he's the only Jewish player in the NBA, to my knowledge. I hope he succeeds."
Frank-Dennis Smith  Knox-Mikal Bridges  RJ-De'Andre Hunter  Obi-Deni Avdija  Wash on 2017. Both guys underpreform as Knicks  Bridges&gt;&gt;Knox RJ&gt;Hunter Obi&gt;Deni  So about the same.
"Israel: Omri Casspi, Gal Mekel, Gal Gadot, Deni Avdija  Palestine: ??????"
"I just gotta say, Deni Avdija is one handsome dude"
"Deni avdija does it alot. He lets the offensive player run into  supposedly ""open lane"" only to meet his body at the end of the run, when it's already too late, forcing the opponent to either pass out or take a bad fade way. It's a pretty neat technique, kinda like the defensive version of a pump fake"
One of the statistically best individual defenders in the League.  Deni Avdija
Deni Avdija
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
Weird way to spell Deni Avdija
"Deni ""Off Day"" Avdija just sounds better in my unbiased opinion"
"Deni Avdija. I don’t think he will ever be a super star, but he will be a really good player who everyone in the league would love to have.   Granted, he is also still only 20. So a leap on offense isn’t out of the question, and that would put him at all star level"
"Deni Avdija allows 0.54 points per isolation possession. It's the best result in the league by wide gap among all players which defended  at least 20 iso possessions (2nd place allows 0.68 pts). And he almost always defends the best scorer of the other team on the floor e.g guys like KD, Harden, Giannis, Butler, when needed he also defends against bigs like JJJ or Bam Adebayo, and also against guards like VanVleet or Rozier... (look https://www.nba.com/stats/players/isolation/?SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TypeGrouping=defensive&amp;sort=PPP&amp;dir=-1&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;CF=POSS\*G\*25)  He also was 6th in DFG% among all players with at least 100 DFGA at 36.9% before the last game... and in the last game against Charlotte opponents were something like  1 FG on 13 FGA with 2 blocks so now his DFG% is even better (look https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?CF=D\_FGA\*G\*100&amp;Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=D\_FG\_PCT&amp;dir=-1)  He also ranks 9th (and 27th overall) in the Defensive RAPTOR  metric (look https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/ )   And also 11th in   ( look [https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA\_2022\_advanced.html#advanced\_stats::dbpm](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_advanced.html#advanced_stats::dbpm))  So if Wizards continue to be play-off team and his minutes continue to go up (more about it in a minute) he can be seriously considered for maybe... 2nd all-NBA defensive team  &amp;#x200B;  Now. The other fact people forget is that he was back from rather significant injury just before start of the season (started ramp-up full activity only in pre-season camp and even missed first pre-season game)  So in October his production was 4.7 pts (44.8 TS%) , 5.3 reb, 1.2 ast - 20.0 minutes  per game  And in November it is 6.9pts (57.3 TS%) , 5.7 reb, 1.5 ast  - 22.8 minutes  per game  Still not great but I think that it's clearly positive tendency"
"Obi Toppin, Deni Avdija, Isaac Okoro, Killian Hayes"
Deni Avdija catching strays!
Deni Avdija. His defense is elite and his offense is coming along.
"I don't really watch the Wizards much since they aren't on national TV. Would there be interest in Jerami Grant and if so, what would you guys give? Like theoretically would something like Thomas Bryant, Deni Avdija, and a protected first work in your mind? Not sure that works with the cap."
Deni Avdija.
"Any wizards fan would tell you either rui hachimura, who has been playing outstandingly in his first 2 years, and we can’t wait to get him back, or deni avdija, who is emerging as a crazy good defender for us"
"Deni Avdija…no path required, he already is **The Denitentiary**  Just add **GOAT** to his name."
Deni Avdija has just received the nickname “The Denitentiary” for his lockdown defense and I am **all for it**  Something more obscure though that I’ve seen is Mount Gillimanjaro for Anthony Gill lol

"I'm not sure if you are sarcastic or not, but I'll answer seriously - Deni Avdija is one of the best defenders in the league right now. Certainly top 5.  His team is absolutely CRUSHING when he is on court. Have they even lost when he was on court? Can someone check that?"
Deni Avdija has been better for the Wizards this year than Rui Hachimiura has ever been.
Deni “The X Man” Avdija aka The Denitentiary
Deni Avdija
Apparently Deni Avdija's defense is the key to our season sooooo I pick specifically Deni Avdija
Take a shot every time Deni Avdija leads the Wizards in +/-
Deni Avdija watches no Netflix and only two minutes of game film a day /s
Deni is typically defending against the best wing or forward of the opposite team.  While doing so according to nba.com his  DFG% is 32.6% which is 2nd best in the league among all players with DFGA &gt; 100  Also per ISO possession Avdija allow just 0.5 pts which is the best in the league (and by large difference best) among all players with over 20 defensive ISO possessions  No one knows whether he's able to continue with this level of defense but right now it is more or less definition of incredible
"guess we have a different understanding of a word *incredible*, that's it.          I wouldn't argue Jrue Holiday is an incredible defender, but Deni Avdija being called *incredible* defender is (in my opinion) a reactionary take partly caused by those recent comments from Unseld Jr. about his defense."

Deni Avdija
Deni Avdija is a menace… +18 wow
"Russ was doing too much, but let's go over what he was working with outside of Beal:  Bryant: played 10 games  Rui: credited Russ with improving, literally your third best player as a second year player that isn't playing at all this year  Bertans: injured and played awful, was meant to be one of your key pieces  Deni Avdija: was one of your better players even though he didn't get much playing time. This is sad, he was a rookie that mostly brought defensive help.  Ish Smith: Ish is a solid backup PG, isn't meant to be more.  Alex Len: god awful  Robin Lopez: He's washed at this stage  Garrison Matthews: Started 24 games, played in 64, and is now in the G-league.   Gafford came in late into the year and they were winning.   Covid and injuries were not the cherry on top, your team was garbage.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/WAS/2021.html  You can go through your own team and tell me how I'm wrong.  Outside of Beal you guys basically have none of your core players from last year and the majority of your core players from last year sucked. You replaced Russ with quality depth, adding in 3 new players, Gafford became a starter, you signed Dinwiddie, and Bertans isn't expected to be one of your best players anymore opposed to a damn 10th man even though he's being paid 17 million.  Russ and beal both played hero ball as your team was trash, quite literally.  Lakers this year, without Lebron, are again not really the best team because we went in on 3 guys and old players and the inconsistency to start the season is massive. Russ isn't a superstar anymore, but the problems go far deeper than him."
"1. They are playing great defense. No it’s not other teams just missing shots. They are defending the perimeter tightly and rotating to prevent paint points.  2. They are moving the ball/themselves and making the right play on offense. It’s not the Brad Beal/Russell Westbrook iso show anymore. Kuz, Gafford, KCP and of course Beal are hitting daggers late in games.  3. The bench mob is the best in the NBA. 6 man of the year (sorry Tyler Hero) Trez Harrell, Raul Neto and the Deni Avdija come in and pound other teams’ benches into oblivion."
"Trezz playing like an All-Star, Deni Avdija has developed into an elite defender, Kuz and Dinwiddie making buckets on consistent basis, Beal have a high evel supporting cast."

Deni Avdija all defense
I like Deni Avdija
"Honestly too much to even fit in one post. Kuzma is really shining as a 3rd scoring option behind Beal and Dinwiddie, hell one could even argue he could be the 2nd scoring option. His defense is shining. We'll see if Bertans wakes up anytime soon and starts making 3s again, although I feel like we've seen some improvements with his off ball movement  So much development to keep track of too with a lot of young players to be excited about. Daniel Gaffords only 23, and when he got traded from the Bulls last season, that's when the Wizards defense really started honing in on a defensive presence in the paint. He plays super hard every minute too. Deni Avdija has been a huge surprise defensively as well, almost becoming our go to defender that can guard positions 1-5. He still has some work on the offensive side but I'm sure it'll come eventually, given his record in Tel Aviv.    And we still have Rui Hachimura who was also amazing last season on the defensive end, runs hard to finish at the rim, and developing a deadly mid-range game that can buy a bucket when we need it.   All of this new defense really opens it up for Thomas Bryant to bring his return too. A big knock on him has always been his defense, but if you have quality defenders in the 3 and 4 positions, and a long and tall Spencer Dinwiddie at PG, they can cover his gaps while he shoots from downtown and brings back his passion to the team.  Honestly there's just so much to be excited about with them this season."
Deni Avdija checking in
https://youtu.be/SPaqpkyKFH0 Deni Avdija Highlights
"Ricky Rubio, Deni Avdija, Bradley Beal, Kuzma, Raul Neto, and Kevin Love? Nah this gotta be the cutest game of all time."
"In his defense it’s hard to be good on defense flanked by Deni avdija, rui hachimura, and Westbrook"
Deni avdija
Deni Avdija is an elite defender and yall cant convince me otherwise
"Deni ""All Defense"" Avdija is here"
Deni Avdija might be the best defender of all time. No I do not need to explain.
Deni “Draymond Green” Avdija
Deni Avdija is turning into a fantastic defender
clearly someone needs to save Jayson from this.   The wizards will offer the celtics bertans and deni avdija... who says no?  can't believe anyone would try to stop Tatum from coming to the wizards... he's desperate to join his best friend in DC
"No Avdija?  Agree with the first four but would probably protect Deni over Kuzma.  We’d def lose some guys with all the former Lakers (KCP, Harrell, Bryant and Kuzma) exposed."
"Like the Heat and Knicks the best out of that group, and like the Wizards the least. I'd like the Wizards more if they played Deni Avdija more, why he isn't getting more of Kuzma/Bertans minutes is beyond me."
