"Goga Bitadze, I'm laying my future on your hands"
free goga bitadze
I wonder the same thing about Goga Bitadze. It’s kinda frustrating.
Is Goga Bitadze playing? Who the hell is Indiana’s center?
goga bitadze? if you people watched us play...
Goga Bitadze. I expected him to make an immediate impact and give the Pacers enough confidence to trade Myles Turner.  I was wrong. He may still end up being good but it looks like a bit more of a longshot than before.
But who’s guarding Goga Bitadze? 🤔
Definitively? Right now it's only Lebron and Goga Bitadze
He doesn't even need to play we are gonna have Goga Bitadze on KAT all night it's a wrap

How much help does Goga Bitadze need??!
Who the fuck is that coach? I know who Goga Bitadze is.   Coaches don't get players traded. Players get coaches fired.
"One of their players, Goga Bitadze, is leaking all this insider turmoil involving their head coach."

I would give my life for Goga Bitadze
"&gt;""Amid a year of difficulties with players and staff, Indiana Pacers coach Nate Bjorkgren's future with the franchise is uncertain as the regular season nears an end, sources tell ESPN. The Pacers are 30-34 and in ninth place in the Eastern Conference.""3 hours ago  The tl;dr of this statement is that the Pacers want a scapegoat despite trading away their 'franchise' player, (albeit for major upside in Levert), being plagued by injuries all season—Sabonis' back, Turner's hand, Caris' literal cancer, etc.). Their record isn't indicative of the coach or his schemes imo especially with the revolving door of injuries.   I literally had to pick up Goga Bitadze because Sabonis went down, and then Goga went down after one game, so I had to pick up O'shae Brissett in fantasy and almost considered picking up Sampson too.. lol"

"It's weird that both this statement and ""Gobert scored as many points as Goga Bitadze on more shots this game"" can be 100% true at the same time"
Goga Bitadze is a 24% 3 point shooter...
"It's a hard decision for the Pacers front office to make. On one hand having a consistent playoff team is extremely good business wise, and they also know fans for the most part except it because it beats being a fan of a team like the Kings or Wolves(sorry guys). But every front office I assume has some desire to compete for real and if they can pull it off it means even better revenue. There's nothing really wrong with the Pacers staying as is, and hoping for a random playoff run where they get hot and the conference favorite gets knocked out early. There's also the chance of blowing things up and it not panning out, which would create job insecurities. Gets a top draft pick doesn't always change things, and you really a top 3 pick to have a good chance at a franchise level player.    If they do decide to go all in on a rebuild then everyone not named Goga Bitadze has to be available, even Sabonis. Im not saying trade him no matter what, and there's nothing wrong with keeping him of you know he's willing to stay through a rebuild, but if a team like say the Kings come in and offer Haliburton and three unprotected first round picks (basically a to good to pass up type of offer) you need to strongly consider it."
And Thybulle was on the board when guys like Goga Bitadze and Luka Šamanic were getting drafted
"Some guys I was REALLY high on at recent Celtics draft positions:  -  * 2020, Pick #26: **Tyrell Terry** – got Payton Pritchard instead  * 2019, Pick #14: **Sekou Doumbouya or Goga Bitadze** – I'd still take either over Romeo Langford but none are really blowing up the league  * 2017, Pick #1: **Markelle Fultz** – got Jayson Tatum instead  * 2016, Pick #3: Take **Dragan Bender** or trade down and get **Jakob Poeltl** – got Jaylen Brown instead  * 2014, Pick #6: I thought **Noah Vonleh** was the new Chris Bosh – got Marcus Smart instead"
Goga Bitadze not afraid
Frank Kaminsky  Cody Zeller  Wily Hernangomez  Goga Bitadze  Mason Plumlee

The Greg Foster - Goga Bitadze kerfuffle would be funny to have in the background at some point.
Psh fools acting like they've never heard of Goga Bitadze
"The draft actually hurts smaller market teams because it handicaps their ability to grow organically and allows bigger markets to just tank and pick up the best prospects, since smaller markets can't tank without hurting themselves financially.  Look at the Pacers, without a draft we could have had the likes of Gordon Hayward, Mike Conley, Eric Gordon, etc. come up, not to mention Larry Bird, Oscar Robertson, Shawn Kemp and other historical greats. Instead we have to try hard every year to be competitive and end up with Goga Bitadze, Aaron Holiday, TJ Leaf etc."
Goga Bitadze played some really meaningful minutes for the Pacers
"Look at everyone picked around him tho. Darius Bazley, Nassir Little, Luka Samanic, Goga bitadze, Dylan Windler.  They all sound like fake names lol."
"Under the radar on the whole Wiseman development thing is that the Warriors have brought in a new assistant coach to replace Jarron Collins this offseason: Dejan Milojevic, a guy who's coached several eventual-NBA-level big men with Mega Basket in Serbia--Goga Bitadze, Ivica Zubac, and most notably Nikola Jokic. While Jokic's passing isn't something that can be taught, Milojevic is apparently an excellent teacher of footwork, which is quite promising."

"One of the dudes quoted as defending Kidd's coaching is Pacers assistant coach Greg Foster, who also tried to fight a Pacers player (Goga Bitadze) on the sideline earlier this year."
&gt;Goga Bitadze  i thought he was like 33 for some reason
"Hopefully, Goga Bitadze. That picture of all the reporters around Zion and no one asking him a single question breaks my heart lol"
They need to trade for Goga Bitadze for posterity's sake.
is that crazy assistant that was about to fight goga bitadze still there? Talk about a big three!
Goga Bitadze?!
And Goga bitadze
Malcolm Brogdon  Chris Duarte  Justin Holiday  Domantas Sabonis  Myles Turner  T.J. McConnell  Goga Bitadze  Oshae Brissett  Jeremy Lamb  Torrey Craig  Isaiah Jackson  Brad Wanamaker  Caris LeVert  DeJon Jarreau  T.J. Warren
"I'll let Indy Star writer Gregg Doyel go ahead:   &gt; Four games into the season, Carlisle has sent a clear message to Myles Turner. After Bitadze played all 12 minutes of the fourth quarter, the first words of Carlisle’s opening statement were these: “The fourth quarter was encouraging,” he said of the only quarter Turner didn’t play. Asked about playing Bitadze and Sabonis together for the entire fourth quarter, Carlisle ignored Sabonis. Talked only about Bitadze. “Goga gave us a nice lift,” Carlisle said and continued for several sentences about Bitadze’s impact in a 10-point loss to a Milwaukee team missing three starters. Every word he said about Bitadze, every over-the-top compliment, was a message to Turner (…)"
Pacers fans that actually think Goga Bitadze is a good player.

The disrespect to Goga Bitadze
"High: Was a fan of these players before they got drafted and often wondered why they werent picked a bit higher.   Dwyane Wade, Donovan Mitchell, John Collins, Deandre Jordan, Andre Iguodala, Danny Granger, Paul George, Joakim Noah, Roy Hibbert, Jrue Holiday, Kawhi Leonard, 	   Domantas Sabonis, Tyler Herro, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Tyrese Haliburton.   &amp;#x200B;  Wrong: I thought these players would be pretty good before the draft.  Marcus Williams, Ben McLemore, Rodney Stuckey, Chris Douglas-Roberts, Earl Clark, Wesley Johnson, Kévin Séraphin, Andrew Nicholson, Nerlens Noel, Rashad Vaughn, Justin Patton, Wendell Carter Jr., Goga Bitadze.'Too soon, but I was high on Jalen Smith, Zeke Nnaji."
Pacers draft well? Let's take a look....  2020 - Cassius Stanley  2019 - Goga Bitadze  2018 - Aaron Holiday and Alize Johnson  2017 - TJ Leaf and Ike Anigbogu  2016 - Georges Niang  2015 - Myles Turner and Joe Young  2014 - Nobody  2013 - Solomon Hill  2012 - Miles Plumlee  2011 - Nobody  10 years worth of draft picks and Myles Turner is the only one who has made any significant noise for the Pacers.
Goga Bitadze is going to be an amazing center.
"Kris Dunn, Elfrid Payton, Marquese Chriss, Goga Bitadze."
Goga Bitadze
"Meanwhile the Pacers (before this year) have drafted:  Cassius Stanley (cut after 1 year)  Goga Bitadze (a Center, when we already are starting 2 Centers, barely plays)  Aaron Holiday (traded him after 3 mediocre years for a pick upgrade to get Isaiah Jackson)  Alize Johnson (barely played, cut after 2 years, now at Houston)  TJ Leaf (absolute trash)  Ike Anigbogu (barely played, cut after 2 years)  Georges Niang (barely played, cut after 2 years, now at Philly)  Caris LeVert (pretty good pick, but we traded him)  Myles Turner (hey, we got one right)  Joe Young (barely played, cut after 3 years)  Solomon Hill (left after 3 years, was ok)  Miles Plumlee (played 14 games here)  Kawhi Leonard (awesome pick, so obviously we traded him draft night)  Davis Bertans (another good pick we traded draft night)"
