"Meh. I don‚Äôt put much stock into those top freshman heavy pre season mock drafts judging strictly off HS tape. Romeo Langford, nas little, Quentin grimes were also sure fire top 10 picks pre season."
I could see Josh Christopher turning into a solid NBA player. Quentin Grimes as well

"Alperen Sengun, Jalen Johnson, Quentin Grimes, Cam Thomas and Miles McBride were the 5 who I felt dropped too far."
"No one is arguing, I have an opinion and he has his about basketball talk, why u taking it to the next level with random shit with the mom has to much during pregnancy? Straight weirdo. Also why is immanuel quickley still playing then? Knicks have young guards like miles McBride and Quentin Grimes, quickley is obv to good for summer league also"
"Well it shouldn‚Äôt have been, he‚Äôs the 3rd string PG with schroder and smart over him, you got guys like immanuel quickley obviously to good to be in summer league still playing, and the Knicks have guards like miles McBride and Quentin grimes as rookies, so obviously you can still make it work"
"I just woke up actually so I slept really good in my new bed, but I woke up with 15 people going off on why Pritchard shouldn‚Äôt be in summer league, when you got guys like immanuel quickley in summer league still lighting it up, and the Knicks also have young guards like Quentin grimes and miles McBride so wouldn‚Äôt they want to see the level of those guards also?"
Keon johnson is on the Clippers. We drafted Quentin Grimes with our first round pick.
"His contract is equal to the 25th pick of this years draft. So ask yourself, would you rather have Moses Brown or Quentin Grimes at 25?? Could make an arguement that Moses is at least an equivalent prospect. In essence, Mavs potentially got themselves the equivalent of a 2021 first rounder in a salary dumb."
"We took Quentin Grimes (25), Deuce McBride (36), and Jericho Sims (58)  We have Rokas (34) but I don‚Äôt know much about him and he‚Äôs probably staying overseas for now"

"I was gonna say Quentin Grimes, JT Thor, and Bones Hyland  Cool names üëå  Daishen Nix sounds like an RNB artist from the early 2000s lol"
I just remembered I went to college with a kid named Quentin Grimes.  I think hes a doctor now
"Quentin ""Rick"" Grimes"
Quentin grimes has a half brother who plays for them. Tyler myers
Quentin ‚ÄúFrank ‚ÄòGrimey‚Äô Grimes‚Äù Grimes
Quentin grimes? The Miami Dolphins are gonna be pissed
Absolutely love Quentin grimes. Clippers got a hell of a guy  Edit: knicks‚Ä¶
Quentin Grimes
Quentin Grimes to the Knicks
Quentin Grimes. He was a top 5 prospect coming outta high school and didn't even look NBA bound after his first college season. He's finally gonna make it now. Sorta like Moses Brown's story but not a one and done. Top recruit to bust to diamond in the rough path to the NBA.
"Miles McBride, Quentin Grimes, Jaden Springer, Josh Christopher"
"Quentin Grimes, Ayo Dosunmu, Herbert Jones, Aaron Henry, to name a few."
6 Bouknight  Trade 16+18 up to 9 or 11 for Moody  If not able to trade then:  Jalen Johnson at 16  Usman Garuba at 18  Vrenz Bleijenbergh at 34  Quentin Grimes at 36
"Bucks have the 31st pick while feels like a pretty volatile place. The dream is Ayo Dosunmu or JT Thor drop past the first round, but more realistically hoping for Miles McBride or Quentin Grimes."
I would take Cam Thomas over Quentin Grimes.
1. Cade Cunningham (Detroit Pistons)  2. Jalen Green (Houston Rockets)  3. Evan Mobley (Cleveland Cavaliers)  4. Jalen Suggs (Toronto Raptors)  5. Scottie Barnes (Orlando Magic) 6. James Bouknight (Oklahoma City Thunder)  7. Jonathan Kuminga (Golden State Warriors) 8. Moses Moody (Orlando Magic) 9. Franz Wagner (Sacramento Kings)  10. Josh Giddey (Memphis Grizzlies)  11. Alperen Sengun (Charlotte Hornets) 12. Keon Johnson (San Antonio Spurs)  13. Davion Mitchell (Indiana Pacers)  14. Chris Duarte (Golden State Warriors)  15. Corey Kispert (Washington Wizards) 16. Trey Murphy (Oklahoma City Thunder)  17. Cameron Thomas (New Orleans Pelicans) 18. Jalen Johnson (Oklahoma City Thunder)  19. Kai Jones (New York Knicks)  20. Jaden Springer (Atlanta Hawks) 21. Ziaire Williams (New York Knicks) 22. Jared Butler (Los Angeles Lakers) 23. Isaiah Jackson (Houston Rockets) 24. Sharife Cooper (Houston Rockets) 25. Tre Mann (Los Angeles Clippers) 26. Joshua Primo (Denver Nuggets) 27. Miles McBride (Brooklyn Nets) 28. Quentin Grimes (Philadelphia 76ers) 29. Day'Ron Sharpe (Phoenix Suns) 30. Josh Christopher (Utah Jazz)   I got bored at work and decided to take a stab at the first round.
"This draft from 20-40 is definitely pretty fluid. JT Thor is a pretty decent pick for you guys, raw offensively but gifted physically and projects to be a good defender right away. Good high upside youngster for an aging core (outside of Giannis). Some other good picks I can think of for you guys would be Quentin Grimes and Deuce McBride. Good two-way players who can shoot the hell out of the ball."
Quentin Grimes becomes a legit starter in this league
"knicks are ready to go all in. quickley, toppin, fournier, quentin grimes, 3 1sts, 3 2nds for beal and whoever else they want to fill in."
Miles McBride is worth 40 million dollars and Quentin Grimes is worth 0
RJ Barret is closer to Miles McBride or Quentin Grimes than he is to Anthony Edwards
Knicks new rookie Quentin grimes' half brother plays in the NHL for a couple of years now.
Quentin grimes drafted by clippers traded to Knicks.
"Popeye Jones has two sons [Seth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Jones_(ice_hockey)) and [Caleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Jones_(ice_hockey)) who play in the NHL, both are members of the Chicago Blackhawks.  Quentin Grimes the Clippers 1st round pick this year has a half Brother [Tyler Myers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Myers) who plays in the NHL for the Vancouver Canucks."
quentin grimes brother is in the NHL
Future one here; if Knicks draft pick Quentin Grimes plays a single game in the NBA he will make history along with his brother Tyler Myers as the first NBA-NHL brother duo.
Derrick Rose &gt; than THJ first off.  KP is an injured bum not worth the money and we invested it in Marcus Morris who was traded for the pick that became Immanuel quickley. We signed Randle and became one of the deepest teams in the league meanwhile the Mavs are struggling to build around Luka. We traded the Mavs pick to go to 25 and draft Quentin Grimes who was torching summer league and got a game winner 3 in preseason with one of the picks and it also got us a conditional first rounder in the next 3 years if Charlotte makes the playoffs and we still have another pick in 2023. We have flexibility to trade for a superstar if this group isn't working and the Mavs are stuck with trying to flip KP which is their best available asset. No one wants that contract and they are on a Luka time bomb  PS. Sexton is a bum why is he even being brought up.
Quentin Grimes robbed
"My buddy and I were there. Knicks looked dead in the water all night and somehow pulled it out. Granted Beal, KCP, and Dinwidde hardly saw the floor during the second half, but we had to grind that shit out, and did so behind big 4th quarter minutes from our rookie Quentin Grimes. It was great to see Mitchell Robinson take the floor tonight too. I love this team."
Quentin Grimes
"on what planet are they better than the knicks core? rj is better than wiseman in almost every way imaginable except height, poole is looking like he‚Äôs gonna have a breakout season, which means he‚Äôs been mediocre before, so how has he been better than mitchell robinson or quickley? obi toppin looks like he‚Äôs ready to break out, so feel free to put him in that mix.   kuminga and moody have played zero games yet, so can you really say that they‚Äôre better than kevin knox, who was a high draft pick and had a great first summer league before getting buried on the bench. so claiming that kuminga and moody have more growth potential than mcbride, quentin grimes, and jericho sims is unfounded."
"Meanwhile, Quentin Grimes out there trying to be completely invisible with his -12 in just 2:33 of playing time."
"How about using the lineups he was using in the first 2 quarters and not having Quentin Grimes playing minutes, goofy."
"Quentin Grimes is so fucking underrated.  And I don't understand why he hasn't got more minutes tbh, he seems like the prototype Thibs guy.  Just.. look at his god damn feet on defense. His footwork is incredible for a rookie and he has both the capability of sticking with players as well as the hustle to fight for rebounds."
Quentin Grimes fills that space
I wonder if Quentin Grimes having a solid game against the Hawks was the final nail in the coffin
I love Quentin Grimes more than life itself
"We are about to be blessed by a lot more Quentin Grimes mins as well, his defense has been impressive for a rookie in his brief stints so far this year"
"I am so fucking glad he‚Äôs doing it  Thanks for trying Kemba, loved seeing you in the Orange and Blue but your time has come. Now give all of his minutes to Quentin Grimes üëÄ"
Who TF is Quentin Grimes tho? Wasn't that the name of a DB on the Atlanta Falcons?
"* We are a better team without Kemba Walker playing  * I love how the lineups were staggered, RJ plays so much better in a fast paced offense like the bench runs  * Quickley‚Äôs defense and playmaking are starting to catch up to his shooting and he may end up being the best point guard on the roster soon  * Alec Burks is a weapon off the bench  * Obi Toppin may be the most energetic big man I‚Äôve ever watched, and one of the best in-game dunkers too  * Quentin Grimes is gonna be a very good 3 and D guy, and Jericho Sims is gonna be a decent rim running center, our draft is looking very nice this year considering where these guys were picked  * Julius Randle is in his own head on offense sometimes, but he played very well defensively and his passing was very important. If he could just play with the energy that our bench does and let the game come to him instead of forcing offense through the low post, he‚Äôd be playing so much better"

"I feel like giving Jalen Johnson minutes can't be worse than Hill and TLC getting them, honestly.   And realistically I'm not sure how giving Cooper a shot can be much worse than Delon Wright and Lou Williams have been so far this year.  That's not to say that you don't want to get your vets right by the playoffs, but these young guys have to be options too.    People love to give Thibs shit for relying too much on the starters and not liking rookies, but he played Obi and IQ big minutes last year, and when we've been missing guys this year he's had no hesitation putting Jericho Sims and Quentin Grimes into games."
Have played literally 100s of 2k franchises with probably thousands of random generated draft classes and have never seen the names Quentin or grimes come up once
"Yeah that‚Äôs the fucking point are you thick?? Cry harder, ya team just lost to Quentin grimes and immanuel quickley."
Trae young has two new fathers - Quentin grimes and immanuel quickley.  IQ spanked him in the fourth
Quentin Grimes is a top 3 NBA name and I'm done being silent about it
"Welcome to the NBA Quentin Grimes, here‚Äôs Chris Paul have fun"
"Agreed, their bench plays with a lot of energy and effort so it's a hard decision to figure out how to make some changes without messing with the chemistry.  They really need some better perimeter defense.  I think they should try to play Quentin Grimes for some defense."
"he's literally the worst guard on our roster, we would probably be doing better giving 100% of his minutes to our rookie quentin grimes"
"What makes it worse for the Lakers is that after two young prospects the Rockets got, there were three players drafted who initially look like they can immediately contribute to playoff teams in Quentin Grimes, Bones Hyland and Cam Thomas."
The guy in the Knicks sub who thinks Quentin Grimes should start over Evan Fournier is really on one.
"Pff, only 18.7 point per 36 ‚Äî Knicks first rounder Quentin Grimes is at 21.6, and you don‚Äôt hear anybody talking about him. Sports media loves their narratives üôÑ"
Jericho Sims and Luka Samanic are locks but Quentin Grimes and Miles McBride are uncertain? lmao uhhhhh
"think of all the players who haven‚Äôt seen much action: cade, bouknight, kuminga, cam, deuce, sharife, jared butler, quentin grimes, primo, moody, jalen johnson.   some of those guys are gonna be big contributors in 2 seasons."
