"Exactly. Ricky's like 80% of the floor general (not nearly the shooter though) at half the cost.   At the end of the day they really didn't give up a lot (it was Rubio, Oubre, Ty Jerome and a 2022 FRP) but part of me wonders if they could've just kept Rubio and flipped Oubre separately."
The Ty Jerome pick/trade was highly praised whilst the Cam Johnson pick was lambasted and not just by Suns fans. Was Mikal Bridges James Jones as well or Mcdonaugh's last hurrah? James Jones and Memphis have cornered the market on older prospects.
I was wondering how ty jerome got to okc when i was playing okc on 2k last nite
If you’ve seen Ty Jerome play for us the past 2 seasons you’d understand why he was shopped.
Can't believe Ty Jerome was basically salary dumped by Phoenix. His profile was a solid 10 year vet.
Why didn’t the suns draft him. He was doing great at ASU right fucking next to you. Thank God we drafted Ty Jerome the clear “college only” archetype
"Last year we lost Ayton, Baynes, and Rubio for stretches and were starting Frank Kaminsky at C while being forced to play Ty Jerome and Ellie Okobo at times. You just don’t know ball, it’s okay to admit it."

"Jerome Robinson, Ty Jerome, Nickeil Alexander Walker of those who still have chance to turn it around  Ante Zizic, Trey Lyles, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson of those who probably lost chance to turn it around  Dion Waiters, Michael Carter-Williams, Tyreke Evans and Michael Beasley of those who most definitely wasted their chances"
"OKC is pretty easy - SGA, Dort, Bazley, Poku, Maledon, Hill (until he’s traded) and Horford (also until he’s traded)  Next two would probably be Ty Jerome and Isaiah Roby if Horford/Hill are traded and no one comes back worth protecting... and we know Presti would trade those two immediately in those circumstances"
"I thought ty Lawson, tyshon Alexander and ty Jerome before I looked for the answer in the comments lol"
"Isn’t it also stupid to compare the Suns to the team last year? They added CP3, Crowder, Cam Payne, and Galloway to replace Rubio, Oubre, Ty Jerome, Jalen Leque, and Ellie Okobo. The difference is noticeable lmao"
And oubre with crowder and replaced ty Jerome and okobo with moore and galloway etc. Lots of great moves overall.
"As a Suns fan who is loving having Chris Paul on his team, I would say that the Suns record from the 2019-2020 season is worse than that team actually was. Injuries/suspensions to Ayton, Baynes, Oubre, Rubio, Booker and others forced Monty to play absolutely terrible bench lineups. I can still vividly remember the 3 pg lineups of: Elie Okobo, Ty Jerome, Jevon Carter, Oubre and Frank. This led to the Suns being worse than the actually were. You may wonder why the Suns played so well in the bubble, well besides major growth from M. Bridges and C. Johnson and the addition of Cam Payne, finally having a completely healthy roster (with the exception of Oubre) allowed this team to play up to its potential.   Also, James Jones had a great offseason - getting rid of Oubre, Okobo, Baynes, and Jerome while adding Crowder, Galloway, Moore, and Nader. Then he added Craig midseason this year and he's been great. The Suns still remain weak in their big man depth (an injury to Ayton or Saric is my number one fear as a Suns fan right now). But the improved depth of this team is tremendous. Everyone on the team belongs on an NBA roster (well, Jalen Smith is TBD there) which is something you couldn't say about most Suns players for the past 5 years.   Point being, while the Chris Paul addition has been big, I think that health and improved depth have been just as consequential, if not more so. In the case of the Suns, it is a massive over simplification to attribute all their improvement to CP3, and it takes away from the work our GM, coaching staff, trainers, and players have put in. I will grant the argument though that without the CP3 trade we don't get Nader, nor do we attract Crowder, Moore, or Galloway.  TLDR: due to multiple injuries at key positions the Suns record last season was worse than the team actually was; thus, using the change in the Suns record from last season to this season as a means for quantifying the impact of Chris Paul on the suns does not paint a completely accurate picture. Improved health and roster depth for the Suns have been just as consequential, if not more so, than the addition of CP3. Without CP3 there is no way this Suns team is a #2 seed in the west, but I believe they'd be sitting in the #5/#6 range if they still had Rubio instead of Paul.   Thank you for reading this rant."

"&gt;The actual question is ""Would the Suns be better with Chris Paul Abdel Nader, and roster space for two of Galloway/Moore/Kaminsky... or Ricky Rubio, Kelly Oubre Jr, Ty Jerome, and Jalen Lecque?"" And the answer is Paul, Nader, and the other two.  Fair enough, but I think given the respective records, it's fairly close.  &gt; You previously mentioned we went 14-7 in our last 21. But we were 6-7 before the bubble, and as much as us Suns love the 8-0 run we did have wins against some resting teams.  14-7 corresponds roughly with Ayton's availability.  Obviously he's a huge deal.  Yes, the bubble was unique, but just in the last month, as I noted elsewhere, the Suns have wins over: the Davis-less Lakers, the McCollum-less Blazers, the Curry-less Warriors, the Davis-and-James-less Lakers, and the Wolves twice.  They also lost to the Wolves and the tanking Magic.  So I think it's fair to equate this season and last, and even to the bubble."
"The Bubble Suns had $18M of that $24M invested in Oubre, Ty Jerome and Jalen Lecque, who were also part of the trade. Granted we took back Nader, that adds $2M more, so realistically, we would have had $8M extra to spend. Considering we have $-18M in cap space, we would have still been $-10M over and unable to sign anyone outside of minimum contracts anyway.  The actual question is ""Would the Suns be better with Chris Paul Abdel Nader, and roster space for two of Galloway/Moore/Kaminsky... or Ricky Rubio, Kelly Oubre Jr, Ty Jerome, and Jalen Lecque?"" And the answer is Paul, Nader, and the other two.   You previously mentioned we went 14-7 in our last 21. But we were 6-7 before the bubble, and as much as us Suns love the 8-0 run we did have wins against some resting teams.   This team is demonstrably better with Chris Paul and a full bench."
"Nothing personal but he doesn't fit our timeline, we needed the roster spot for a young player, and he's probably gonna lead us to a couple of wins tbh  We now have rookie Theo Maledon and Ty Jerome for point guard lol. Rivers deserves to be on a playoff team"
I’d take ty Jerome with 1 wet foot
"Damn, imagine trying to win a title and struggling against Ty Jerome and fuckin' Moses Brown."
Ah yes the Ty Jerome whom I had so much hope for
I saw Ty Jerome for the first time against the Knicks but I didn't know who he was so I assumed Svi just looked oddly different that day
Ty Jerome man... I was high on him on pre-draft. I thought he was out of the league. Then I saw him starting and I was happy for him.

"I watched a Thunder game for the first time the other day. Is it really just iso after iso?   All I saw was Ty Jerome (and another player who I can’t remember) repeatedly try to score by himself on every possession. Not hating, but just trying to understand so welcome thoughts of Thunder fans!"
"It's not necessarily tied to an elite defensive team at all, it's just very lineup and replacement reliant and it doesn't actually do anything to try and quantify what a player does defensively.   &gt;If individual defensive rating only about having an elite defensive team then why is Giannis ranked so high if his team is barely in the the top 10?  I mean using one example is just bizarre. I could easily ask you why the hell Rudy Gay and Patty Mills are the two best defenders in the league according to individual defensive rating? Does the fact that they're both on the same team not perhaps hint that maybe it isn't so ""individual"" after all? Why are Rudy gay, patty mills, Cameron johnson, Ty jerome, Bobby Portis, Derrick Rose, Alec Burks, Shake Milton, and Kyle Kuzma all better defenders than Joel Embiid who is somehow 30th? Why does Rudy Gobert barely scrape into the top 10, despite clearly being the most impactful defender in the league? Why is DPOY candidate Myles Turner a whopping 64th!? Behind notable defensive studs Malik Monk and Duncan Robinson?  ""How do you reconcile that?""  Or is this argument only to rationalise voting LeBron James first because he's an amazing player who should have more MVPs? Just because he's had an incredible career, doesn't mean he should win again this year."
"to be fair to Poku, OKC played without Shai and George Hill, and their only guards were Théo Maledon and Ty Jerome who are interesting prospects themselves but still getting their feet wet.      and nyk has an amazing defense"
"The coaching being good or SGA and Dort being good doesn't get to me. I just get mad about guys like Ty Jerome and Kenrich Williams being good for literally no reason. It's like WTH guys, why are you such try hards. You know they aren't part of our future, and they have like no trade value, yet they're just killing us in the lottery by making the bench decent.  Ah well. Congrats on the Hami trade. I think you will be pleased. He's a great energy guy off the bench."
"Your team is well coached, as long as guys actually play their positions you'll be competitive lol. Might force yall to really do stuff like play Horford at 4 with Brown, or continue the full Poku experience to really tank. Ty Jerome looking decent isn't helping lol"
Just caught up with the first half   Who the fuck is Ty Jerome
Them Thunder guys off the bench like Kenrich and Ty Jerome are kinda good
"I absolutely agree with mpmar's description on how Jerome is playing this year.   I'd just add that I really appreciate how much smoother the ball movement is when Ty comes in (were a pretty young squad so I guess it's all relative). He'll also occasionally shoot this deep ""Fuck You"" 3 pointer from the top of the key and I swear he's like 60% lol.  But to clarify--when I am saying that Maledon/Jerome/Kenny have emerged, I'm referring to them as collectively solidifying our 2nd unit ball handling duties.   The original second unit line-up we had at the beginning of the year was Maledon/Hami/Poku. That was pretty damn hard to watch as their combined deficiencies quickly devolved the offense into ""Hami ball"" (which--again--was effective, but not the system our coaches are trying to implement)"
Is Ty Jerome playing well? He never could figure it out in Phoenix
"I think it's a couple of things. Notably:  1) I suspect there's some built in good-will due to the Presti-Weaver connection (Troy was basically the guy who drafted him in 2018)  2) Hami most likely did not want to play for OKC after this season. I'm pretty sure that if Hami had the choice he would choose to play for his hometown Knicks (literally goes super saiyan every time he plays in MSG)  3) The emergence of Theo Maledon, Ty Jerome, and Kenny Hustle solidified our bench rotation ball handlers, and it made Hami expendable. Especially because Hami is so damn ball dominant on offense (which isn't necessarily a bad thing but it's pretty much the exact opposite of what our offensive system is asking for this year).   With that said i'm kind of nervous how the OKC locker room will take it. It's a bunch of young dudes and Hami was a super popular with everyone."
He got fleeced when the Sixers got Matisse Thybulle for Carsen Edwards and Ty Jerome
"Look at the minutes by Pokusevski,  Maledon, Ty Jerome and Moses Brown"
"That's Ty Jerome, on Virginia when they won the national championship in 2019. It's also worth mentioning he's struggling to stay in the league, even on this Thunder roster."
"Literally just in the last 3.5 years   -  June 19, 2017: Traded a 2017 1st round draft pick (Markelle Fultz was later selected) to the Philadelphia 76ers for a 2017 1st round draft pick (Jayson Tatum was later selected) and a 2019 1st round draft pick (Romeo Langford was later selected)  - July 7, 2017: Traded Avery Bradley and a 2019 2nd round draft pick (Isaiah Roby was later selected) to the Detroit Pistons for Marcus Morris.  - August 30, 2017: Traded Jae Crowder, Isaiah Thomas, Ante Žižić, a 2018 1st round draft pick (Collin Sexton was later selected) and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Skylar Mays was later selected) to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Kyrie Irving.   - July 6, 2019: Traded Aron Baynes and Ty Jerome to the Phoenix Suns for a 2020 1st round draft pick (Desmond Bane was later selected). (top-7 protected)  - July 6, 2019: Traded Terry Rozier and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Grant Riller was later selected) to the Charlotte Hornets for Kemba Walker and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Yam Madar was later selected)."
"Current: Ty Jerome. I think anyone who isn't a Thunder fan has basically only seen OKC play once or twice this season, so they don't realize how good he has been. He's basically the new Duncan Robinson. Look at their per-36 minute numbers this season:  Jerome: 16.1 points, 4.2 rebounds, 5.5 assists, 44.6% FG, 42.3% on 7.7 3-pointers, 0.9 steals, 0.3 blocks  Robinson: 15.1 points, 4.0 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 44.2% FG, 41% on 9.7 3-pointers, 0.6 steals, 0.3 blocks  And Jerome is three years younger."

&gt;The only common denominator between both teams is Stevens   Well Actually the common denominators are the Jays. I think that they both should be traded this off season for the way the team has underperformed. Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum for Ty Jerome and Al Horford who says no?
I actually heard we offered up Dame and Picks for Ty Jerome at the deadline. They hung up
Offensively Mulder is inconsistent unless it's garbage time.  Defensively he might be the worst guard in the league. He doesn't have the strength to keep guys from blowing through him and he has low IQ so he makes terrible reads and times rotations horribly. And he makes unnecessary movements. For example the other night Moses Brown was coming over to set a screen for Ty Jerome and Mulder jumped it prematurely 35 feet from the basket which lead to a wide open 3
Hasn’t Ty Jerome been balling recently? Why does he get DNPs over the scrubs you’re playing?
Context aside? Definitely Ty Jerome. The Blazers would be fools to not hop on a deal like that
ty jerome?!

"OKC fans, why the fuck is Bazely shooting 13 3s a game? Ty Jerome was single handedly keeping the game interesting in the first half but Bazely kept bricking away"
Is Ty Jerome a real player now? He's been looking pretty good with increased opportunity. Could he elevate to being a deep rotation player on a good team?
"I agree on that, I’ll take 30 ugly games to end the year for a chance to be great down the line. Magic are always middling, magic fans know that, but I think we can appreciate the trying. There’s been a ton of transactions the last 6-7 years, just nothing seems to work out.   How is ty Jerome looking for okc btw. Loved watching him at Virginia and was kind of hoping the magic would take a chance on him as a steadying hand. He’s not flashy, but he gets it done."
"I know it's hard for you to understand, but the Thunder really are interested in developing the players that they are testing out right now. That's literally the point of resting Al Horford. He's 100% gone next year, so we might as well see if Moses Brown or Bradley is any good. We would be doing it even if we were in Houston's spot - guaranteed #1 lottery odds. And as Icarpet noted, Bazely, Poku, Maledon, Roby, Kenrich, and Ty Jerome will 100% be back next year and we are using this time to develop them. You haven't been paying attention to the Thunder at all. You just buy into this narrative that everything the Thunder have done is tanking. It's not. Certainly tanking is part of it, but there's a lot more nuance here, just like there is in Detroit. Literally same GM tree.  And keep putting that tinfoil hat on about ""excuses"" with Shai and Dort's injuries. They are real. Just because we are tanking, doesn't mean players can't get hurt."

Why else wouldn’t you play Ty “White John Stockton” Jerome?
"Heir is a difference between developing young players to be better and putting them in a position to fail so that your pick is maximized.  Moses Brown has proven to be an awesome player  and unless he got hurt in the Pacers game, there was no reason for him to only play 18 minutes.  It’s already a blow out so have him run for 30.  The extra twelve ain’t hurting him.  Dort has improved tremendously yet he got a dnp for an injury that no one is aware of.  Nobody thinks Kenrich Williams is a great difference maker yet he’s clearly the best wing available and yet he doesn’t get over thirty minutes.  That’s hella sketchy.  Same with Ty Jerome.  He’s the best guard you have with SGA out.  He’s nothing special but isn’t it a slap in the face of a player like him trying to make it in the league and get paid to give him a coaches DNP because he’s slightly better than who you have on the court.  Detroit resting dudes is silly but they at least throw out all of their young guys for extended minutes even the good ones like Isiah Stewart who might screw up the tank.  Houston is giving Kevin Porter and Christian Wood all they can eat while they are healthy and if they lose they lose but at least they want to see what two cornerstones can do when healthy so they know who can be put around them.  We have no choice but to play our vets because we are so injured we just gotta play whoever is healthy to field an actually team.  We don’t have DNP luxuries.  I’d wish OkC fans can see why certain other fans find their non transparent tanking methods to be awful for the league."
Ty Jerome is better against the Celtics than he is against UMBC
"That was the only time he has been DNP'd all season, and if you think Ty Jerome is really gonna make a huge difference I don't know what to tell you.  Why the hell would they lie about Dort being injured? Do you suspect every players on bad teams of faking injuries?"
"Ty Jerome played 0 minutes last night and was probably the only NBA caliber player that suited up.   I don’t buy the Dort injury, but it is what it is."
"the only person resting is horford lol. Are you saying Ty Jerome is a crucial piece to an NBA team and shouldn’t be rested? SGA, Poku and Dort are injured and it’s not like 2 of those 3 will change much."
"Weren't raptors fined cause there was discrepancy between the injury report and Nurse said pre game. For the Spurs ""teams should not rest multiple healthy players for the same game. When they do rest healthy players, it is supposed to be in home games."" is what  the league resting policy says. So unless you believe thunder are just lying about their injury report it doesn't seem like they are breaking any rules unless you wanna complain about ty Jerome not playing which is just funny."
"They didn't want to pay Harden in hindsight one of the biggest mistakes in NBA trade history. That aside the Front Office have made great moves. If Beverley hadn't injured Westbrook there more than likely could have had a championship. They got burned by KD and learnt from it, trading PG, Westbrook, CP3 for great returns as well as the role players Adams and Grant. Those players that you name have passed through at different stages, I think the way the Thunder handled the transition from Westbrook in particular who was a cornerstone of the franchise was really well done. Both sides were in agreement, Westbrook was keen to re-unite with Harden and the Thunder were eyeing up a rebuild. When Shai was traded for PG we had a new face for the franchise. I think the fan base is excited for our young guys with an eye to the draft. We have got Dort if course and now the euro sensations Poku and his fanny pack and Maledon. Throw in some good energy bench guys like Kenrich Williams, Ty Jerome and Isaiah Roby and the future is looking bright."
i mean ik shai and Lu are hurt but ur post said they should be celebrating. No they shouldn’t. Also TY Jerome got a DNP-CD in a 57 point loss
He could be resting to play a larger role tomorrow against the Suns in the back to back. No clue but again sitting Ty Jerome isn’t grounds for the league to get involved
Ty Jerome and Poku played 0 seconds combined tonight and they’re like the only NBA caliber players on the roster lol
"I'm sorry are people actually crying over **Lu Dort**, **Ty Jerome** and **Aleksej Pokusevski**? Don't get me wrong those are my guys, but c'mon lol by that logic teams resting stars on back-to-backs should be banned forever"
If the league fines the Thunder for sitting Ty Jerome then they should fine every team in the league
"What about Ty Jerome? He’s been having a pretty solid stretch, he isn’t hurt, and he didn’t get a single second of play tonight."
"You're resting guys like Lu Dort, Ty Jerome and Aleksej Pokusevski when you're already a bottom feeding team? That's literally throwing a game, I can't imagine anyone would condone that"
They had to rest their 2 GOATs tonight Aleksej Pokusevski and Ty Jerome
Bruh Ty Jerome didn't getting playing time in a 57 point loss lmao.
"and all it took was trading Ricky Rubio, Ty Jerome, and a FRP"
Time to trade Ty Jerome to a contender!
"Well you guys have stone cold killer Ty Jerome, so whether you like it or not he's gonna win y'all some games."
"Its unfair to expect a depleted Celtics to beat a superteam consisting of Ty Jerome, Darius Bazley, and Lu Dort"
When Ty Jerome dropping double digits on you you know youre in trouble
"As an Auburn fan, fuck Ty Jerome  As a Heat fan, I fucking love Ty Jerome"
Not sure I understand. Isn't Ty Jerome was frontrunner for MVP this year?
"In the salary cap era you really just can't expect to beat a team able to convince Ty Jerome, Darius Bazley, and Luguentz Dort to join one big superteam, and STILL have salary left over for Isaiah Roby. That's just unfair."
Imagine getting J'd by mf Ty Jerome fml

Show some love to Ty Jerome
Ty Jerome is cash
"https://www.nbcsports.com/edge/basketball/nba/player-news/headlines/10105976  &gt;Lu Dort (The Al Horford Special, right hip, tank commander, Cade Cunningham) will not play on Monday vs. Philly.   &gt;Of course he won't. Dort has had a remarkable season and that's why the Thunder continue to hold him out of back-to-backs as they try to make up ground with fellow tankers Houston, Detroit, Minnesota and Orlando. This draft class is loaded with talent if you're wondering why tanking has gotten out of hand this season. Look for Svi Mykhailiuk, Ty Jerome and Kenrich Williams to soak up extra minutes. Dort will probably see time in three of OKC's five games this week."
Bruh. Do you reallly believe that Ty Jerome is better then Ingles because he starts?
"CP3 has zero right to be upset.   ""It's A Business"" works both ways. Houston could not retain some of their key players because Chris Paul wanted the max possible, so the Rockets gave him a four year max. Paul even had the rules changed to the Over 38 Rule, since he runs the NBPA's executive committee, which enabled him to get that massive extension.   He could have left money on the table to resign other key players to help win a championship.  But he didn't, and that's OK, that's his right, since ""It's A Business""   But it works both ways. Chris Paul can look after what's best for him but the Rockets can't? And what would have been the purpose of a conversation? So Paul can go to his agent and cry to the press and say the Rockets are backstabbing him to force them to trade him to a different place?   If Chris Paul wanted freedom of choice in where he plays, he should have signed one year contracts. Give And Take. You give up long term security but you take more freedom. What Chris Paul wanted was both, which is utter bullshit. Or Chris Paul could have stayed with one team long enough to trigger the ability to have a NTC, and then use that power. But he didn't.   It's a sad day when being a leader on the court and playing hard is some kind of magnificent achievement. It's called being a professional. It's called doing your job. That's what he's being paid to do.   The ridiculous notion that NBA players are doing these franchises a favor by doing the bare baseline of being a professional is mind boggling.   ""You owe me for doing the job that I'm being paid to do!""   That's what the money is for....  As for the Suns, if another team was offering more in value to OKC than Kelly Oubre, Ricky Rubio, Ty Jerome, Jalen Lecque and a 2022 first-round pick, do you think they'd pass that up to reward Paul for simply doing his job?   This kind of stuff drives fans from the game. Lots of people are out of work and many are losing their businesses and homes because of the pandemic. Hearing about  NBA guys bitching about the food in the bubble or crying on social media about things that don't have anything to do with basketball or just being divas, it's not the right way to appeal to masses of fans out there.   It's not just the social justice messaging, it's not just the pandemic, it's not just the Free Hong Kong stuff, it's all of it together, including crap like this issue with Chris Paul - It drives fans away."
Wouldn't have even needed a kings ransom to get him. Suns gave up Oubre/Ricky Rubio/Ty Jerome/Jalen Lecque and a first. Horford/a young player/cap filler/2 1sts likely would have got it done.

"Look all I know is that our 19 year old rookies (Maledon and Poku) are getting like 30 minutes per game of raw NBA experience and they have been so legit exciting to watch since the all star break. (There's been a big improvement in play lately. And there are more positives things than negative every game now).  Like these guys would normally be college freshman in the US (Poku would still be in high school). Their younger than most of the 2020 draft and we get to oversee and micromanage their development. Whatever draft position we do end up with, these current rook's are ending the season on a high note. (Seriously Poku was getting 20 mpg before the G league and it was a fucking nightmare)   Also--our ""development year"" is allowing us to see and put to practice Lu Dort's offensive potential. This undrafted 20 year old got 42 points with us in his second year. I don't think any competitive teams would let Lu Dort shoot 31 times in a game  Also this season has allowed us to discover how tasty of snacks Kenny hustle and Ty Jerome are. Seriously Ty Jerome went from a 28% 3pt shooter to 40%. And we found out about Moses Brown.   So I am still pretty feeling good about what we've found out about the team this season."
helped that last year Phoenix basically had no real back up PG (Carter isn't one and Ty Jerome wasn't cutting it) so Payne was allowed to come and run wild in the bubble when Rubio sat.
"So, just to be clear, the success has nothing to do with CP3? They would be in the same position this year with Ty Jerome? Or with Cam Payne playing CP3’s minutes? Come on man… how did that amazing bubble run end? What about the other bubble greats?"
"He provided us with one of the best seasons of OKC basketball and gave SGA a new best friend who helped him blossom into the player he was this year. That enough was worth the trade.   Throw in that Houston trade, getting the assets from the Suns that helped us get Poku, a Minnesota second round pick, a future Suns first, and Ty Jerome. I know the Suns eventually won this trade with how well they are doing, but the amount of value we got off CP3 is unbelievable. I hope he wins a ring."
no one mentioning TY JEROME :(
"Presti - Ah, I'll buy it at a high price! (Horford + Ty Jerome + ??? for Zinger and a couple of picks)"
"He was somewhat passive in his 2 years at UVA, and tended to defer to Ty Jerome and Kyle Guy (granted, both were future draft picks as well).   You could see the potential oozing from Dre, but the consistency on offense wasn't there. But when he was on, you knew he was gonna be great"
"Right now top 3 for Thunder would probably be   1: Shai 2: Dort  3: Horford  If/when Horford leaves I would say Ty Jerome but a lot of people would say Bazley and I wouldn’t disagree all that much. Regardless, it will almost certainly change by the beginning of next season when the draft and the Micic decision is made."
I love seeing young guys that you draft do well. Im glad that my guy Ty Jerome seems to be playing pretty well for the Thunder! I never would have expected 42% from 3 though.
"Believe it or not, I think it's OKC. If the ping pong ball bounces in their favor, they can get 1 or 2 solid player this year.  And look at the situation of the clippers, those picks they owed are getting quite interesting consider Leonard hasn't resigned yet. Plus, SGA, Dort, Ty Jerome (yep, I said it), and all those extra picks to trade. This team can be really interesting in 2 or 3 years. Which is a clearer path than most of the bad teams."
"I think the Pistons, with Hayes/Bey/Stewart/Sekou/this year's pick are up there. Thunder with SGA/Dort/Bazley/Poku/Maldeon/Ty Jerome/Moses Brown are one of the deepest."
Lmao what shitty officiating? The missed double dribble that only occurred because some dude was yanking Ty Jerome by the jersey and didn't get called for it?
"The Thunder's goal for this season was to tank while developing our young talent as much as possible.  SGA made a significant leap, Dort showed signs of improvement on offense while maintaining his defense.  We found guys like Kenrich Williams and Ty Jerome who could stay in OKC for the long haul as good role players.  Coach Daigneault was very impressive getting as many wins from this team as he did.  I'm excited to see how he does when the organization actually wants to win.  For most of the season it seemed our hopes of getting a top-5 pick in the draft were going to be dashed.  But after SGA's injury the team bottomed out to a historic degree.  Although the ""win"" against the Clippers last night was a blow, the Thunder are currently positioned to get at least one coveted top-5 pick, with an outside shot at a second.  So overall I'd say the tank was a success.  I'd give this season a B+.  Things didn't go perfectly, but I think the Thunder accomplished most of what they wanted to.  Now we just have to hope the lottery goes our way and doesn't cause our tanking to have been in vain."
"Kelly Oubre, a good starting wing. Ricky Rubio, a decent starting my PG. Ty Jerome, a decent young bench PG, Jalen Lecque a prospect with decent defensive upside and a 2022 first round pick which at the time was a projected lottery pick.   That’s a pretty decent haul. A Deal centered around Maxey and Thybulle isn’t better. Now it might be crippling for you considering a deal would involve putting Green in to match salary and having very little if any SG depth, but to say their value is higher than that Kelly, Ty, Jalen and a projected lottery pick is not true. It’s ridiculous to imply so.   CP3s deal is marginally better, just like how CP3 is marginally better than Lowry. But value is subjective so you’re free to think whatever you want."
"He wanted to go to the Bucks when he first go to OKC but they didn't make a move for him so we do know CP3 would have been happy to play for the Bucks.   Did you see what PHX gave up for CP3 compared to what the Bucks gave up for Jrue?   Kelly Oubre, Ricky Rubio, Ty Jerome, Jalen Lecque and a FRP  Bledsoe, Hill, 3 FRPs, 2 pick swaps for Jrue Holiday   Bucks could have got CP3 if they wanted. That's damn near a Harden package they gave up for Jrue Holiday."
"Hasn’t really been miss since Ryan McDonut was in charge  James Jones has his guys and frankly has pretty much done nothing but hit home runs in the draft. The Bridges pick was him and Sarver (McDonut wanted SGA, which would have been good too), the Cam Johnson pick was him, Ty Jerome is looking like he’ll be a player in the league and it’s honestly wayyyy to earlier to say on Stix, he’s played less than 100 minutes"
"imagine trading Oubre (who's always been a  negative), Rubio, Jerome, and Lecque for Chris Paul and being worried about chemistry and depth. lol did you really want Ty Jerome playing minutes that matter? or  the famous Kelly Oubre team chemistry buff? I'd be loving it too lmao"
"Without George Hill as well for 6-7 weeks and Ty Jerome hadn't come back yet. Shai was the lead guy but the rest of the playmaking was shared between Dort, Kenny, Al and Hami. None of those are great playmakers but somehow Coach Mark made it work"
"I really don't get how people underestimate OKC as this cute little eternally rebuilding team with *checks notes* 35+ draft picks in 7 years (aw shucks)  What it really means is they have the assets and cap space to become instantly better whenever Presti decides to pull the trigger. That shit is scary. One day it's a G-League farm then tomorrow a big 3 of SGA, Simmons and [insert all star scorer here] that they got for Kenrich, Ty Jerome, Baze and 7 first rounders."
I honestly don’t know how Ty Jerome turned it around when a year ago he wasn’t athletic enough to get the ball over half court
Hey Ty Jerome has looked pretty good and Oubre/Rubio turned into other assets
Get this man a mf ring Phoenix thanks for Ty Jerome and Poku!
The 2022 FRP probably wont be too useful and Oubre was flipped so idk what he was flipped for  Ty Jerome is meh
"Probably the main thing was Ty Jerome, a 2022 first round pick, and Kelly Oubre who was traded to the warriors for a 2021 first round pick and a 2021 second round pick  But from OKCs perspective they pretty much wanted to dump Paul’s salary and continue their rebuilt. Sam presti also just likes first round picks  “I want to pick every single pick in the first round one year.” - Sam Presti probably"
"yeah because Chris Paul and Clint Capela make comparable amounts of money  the rockets last year would've literally had no use for ricky rubio, ty jerome, kelly oubre or jalen leque so i dont see where they get capela in all this  i just dont get how you think Luka and Capela is better than CP3 and Ayton, especially when you dont have to worry about the biggest problem with Luka and Booker - who's the first option? Luka is a ball dominant guard, Book's a ball dominant guard - just seems silly to me, especially when Ayton is as good as he is at such a young age  Capela grabbing boards isn't enough to anchor a championship-level defense, and neither is two ball-dominant superstars - basketball teams arent JUST about being good at scoring, they need to be versatile and having CP3, Ayton and Booker makes the Suns a more versatile team than if they had Luka, Booker and Capela"
Kemba was just to make salary work. Might be overvaluing Dort but thought was he could give you Simmons perimeter D while being able to hit open shots and Ty Jerome is another shooter to surround Embiid. #6 or a different pick would just be to get add another piece like a vet pg.
"This conversation comes up time and time again, and yet nearly every year there seems to be a trade where we're all sure that the selling team has no leverage, and still they flip an under-appreciated player into a big return.  It happens for a variety of reasons, but it does happen regularly. It only takes one team to think they can fix Ben for a big haul to be offered.  Remember when Westbrook was considered such a toxic contract that OKC was going to have to attach multiple picks to offload him, and then they flipped him for CP3, who was then flipped again for multiple assets including (eventually) four 1st round picks, three 2nd round picks, two pick swaps and Ty Jerome?  It just takes one team desperate for a chance at a difference maker, and a perpetually mediocre team like Sacramento, Detroit etc could definitely be tempted to try for a high risk high reward reclamation project."
Where would you rank Ty Jerome that’s probably hard rank
Ty Jerome
So…  PG - Kemba Walker  SG - Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  SF - Luguentz Dort  PF - Darius Bazley  C - Mike Muscala  6th - Ty Jerome  7th - Theo Maledon  8th - Isaiah Roby   And assuming they don’t grab anyone of starting interest in FA which I don’t think they will?
"I find it interesting that the Sixers, who worked SO hard to fucking LOSE every year to stock pile lottery picks, seemed to get the most disappointing picks (though they are not all 'busts' exactly).    Nerlens.   Michael Carter-Williams (and he was ROY).   Okafor.  Simmons.   In fact, the only player they drafted during their FIVE-YEAR 'process' that will be with the team moving forward (assuming a Simmons trade goes through) is Embiid.   And they got him the second year.   One of the best players they picked up Mikal Bridges, and they shipped him out straight away but has developed into a solid player.   Ty Jerome too.   They also shipped out Jerami Grant pretty early as well.   That team has just been all about moving and getting assets and throwing everything to the wall and seeing what sticks and jumping off if it doesn't work straight away (with Embiid and Simmons being the only players they have been willing to wait on).   All of that instead of taking the time to develop the talent they get."

"I'd rather be the third team. Ben is perfect in Minny but either way, we don't have that win now package Morey is looking for unless they view DLo as an All-Star still (I mean, he did make it once) while OKC sends out players like Bazley/ Roby, Svi/ Deck, Ty Jerome, and Kenrich Williams, for depth"
PG: Marcus Howard SG: Jalen Lecque SF: Ty Jerome  PF:Kevin Love (Never plays)  C: Erik Paschall
"OKC - SGA, Dort, Poku, Bazley, Theo, Giddey, Mann, JRE protected  Unprotected - Ty Jerome, Kenrich, Deck, Muscala, Favors, Roby, Vit Krejci, Charlie Brown Jr, Josh Hall  Would expect to lose Kenrich and Ty Jerome in an expansion draft, assuming each expansion franchise can only take one apiece from a team. Maybe Vit but I don’t think he’s signed a deal officially and don’t know if a player’s rights can be taken in an expansion draft or if they have to have an NBA contract."
Is that Suns legend Ty Jerome?
"I joined this Fantasy Football league where you can play against Malcolm Brogdon, George Hill, Ty Jerome, Myles Turner, Garrett Temple, De'Andre Hunter, Justin Anderson, Joe Harris, Anthony Tolliver, Kevin Huerter, Diamond DeShields, and Victoria Vivians. There are still spots but you have to sign up by the 24th. There is a live virtual draft with all the players on the 26th.  https://www.brogdonfamilyfoundation.org/waterbowl"
"Of the Clippers rookies I expected the least from Brandon Boston right away, but hes been the best rookie from their class so far. He’s shown excellent flashes. Good three point shooter, good passer and very active on defense. He’s impressed me the most of their crop.   Keon Johnson looks very raw but his athleticism is notable. His three point shot needs work, but I’m glad he’s not gunshy (Jerome Robinson was always scared to shoot). His defense has been good. I believe he would benefit the most from playing with the regular roster.   Jason Preston he has excellent court vision and pace. His passes have been very good and on the off chance they are bad it’s mostly timing, instead of not seeing the potential pass. His defense has been mediocre and the rest of his offensive package has been lacking, but he can learn from Rondo and Ty Lue hopefully.   As far as other teams go I liked what I saw from Jordan Nwora. He looks like a legit nba player."
"Saw that Pacers' Malcolm Brogdon's charity is hosting a fundraiser where you can play fantasy football against NBA and WNBA players. They'll have a live draft event on August 26th. Right now the players are Diamond DeShields, Victoria Vivians, George Hill, Ty Jerome, Myles Turner, Garrett Temple, De'Andre Hunter, Justin Anderson, Joe Harris, Anthony Tolliver, Kevin Huerter, Malcolm Brogdon. https://www.brogdonfamilyfoundation.org/waterbowl"
"Still have no fucking idea why Ainge drafted a sub 6' shooting guard with such a high second rounder.   Actually I love telling the story of how they drafted Carsen Edwards because it's such a clusterfuck:  2019 draft night - Boston owns #20 which ends up being Matisse Thybulle. Boston has 3 first rounders that night so they're kind of forced to trade out.  Boston trades #20 for #24 (Ty Jerome) and #33 (Carsen Edwards). #24 ends up getting traded along with Aron Baynes to Phoenix to free up cap space to overpay Kemba Walker. Phoenix has a protected 2020 first from Milwaukee that they give to Boston.  2020 draft night - Boston's first from the previous trade is #30 which ends up being Desmond Bane (all rookie team, mind you). That pick is immediately traded to Memphis for future second rounders.  Those future second rounders are traded for a half a season of Evan Fournier. Boston then traded their 2021 FRP (#16) along with Kemba Walker to OKC for Al Horford and to free up cap space which they were hopefully going to use to re-sign Fournier. Fournier dipped for the bag.  So long story short, Boston squandered those picks (and ended up giving another pick away) for pretty much nothing."
"Ty Jerome, Kenrich Williams, and three of the middling FRPs.  But after reports Ben really wants the glamorous life, realistically nothing."
"I think out of our roster the tradeable guys that teams would actually want are probably Bazley, Maledon, Ty Jerome, Kenrich Williams and maybe Isaiah Roby  Would be fine with any of those for Lauri tbh"
"With Tre Mann, Bazley, Theo, and Ty Jerome on the bench I like our young core a lot."
"The Thunder can fix some of those issues. Kemba Walker, Isaiah Roby, Ty Jerome and Kenrich Williams and the Houston picks for Simmons. Jerome shot 43% on 5.3 3PA last season, some of those were pretty deep and he's a legit backup point guard. Kenny Hustle is a do it all forward who also shot above 40% from outside last season, he also has a wet mid-ranger. Roby is another decent 4/smallball 5 who can score inside and pass the ball. Isaiah's not perfect but dude is tough. With those three players, Philly fills out their bench with decent, productive contributors on cheap contracts. Kemba is another effective outside shooter who can provide perimeter creation. It is breaking a dollar into quarters but Philly get better as a team with this move."
"Thunder could easily fulfill the pick request, but would the Sixers be cool with getting Kemba. We could throw in Kenrich Williams or maybe Ty Jerome.  Simmons then plays small ball center for us and we are full of long playmakers."
"I don't get it. OKC has a ridiculous guard rotation right now.  Not including Kemba, you all have Shai/Maledon/Tre Jones/Dort/Ty Jerome. All young guys who are looking for playing time.  Kemba's probably not long for the team and if I had to pick an odd-man out it'd be Ty Jerome (he had some solid efficiency last year though I hope a team gives him a flier if he's gone)."
"True, I expect them to move Hield for another big or a stretch four once Holmes is resigned. They’re not going to get anything of value for Bagley anyway, another trade I was thinking for Bagley would be to the Thunder for Ty Jerome and Kenrich Williams. Both cheap rotational pieces."
"I mean compared to the NBA sure, I'm not saying he'll be Lonzo athletically more like Ty Jerome."
Don’t forget theo maledon and ty jerome!
Ty Jerome a low key great season in OKC compared to what he was doing in PHX. I believe he will be a decent player eventually.
There’s no guarantee those guards pan out I saw a tweet saying the past backup guards the Suns drafted were  Ty Jerome Ellie Okobo De’Anthony Melton Tyler Ulis Tyler Ennis  Kendall Marshall   So I don’t have too much faith in us drafting back end guards
Ty Jerome and a first as well. At the time I don’t blame them either in hindsight obviously they would reconsider. I’m not saying they are crazy for turning it down but they are crazy for being so offended by us even asking for herro and acting like we would have to add multiple firsts to do cp3 for  herro. In actuality they would have had a great chance at winning the finals with cp3 that year.
"Dude Chris Paul, with one year left on his deal, was worth Kelly oubre, Ricky Rubio, Ty Jerome, Jalen Lecque, and a late first at his age 36 season. Chris Paul is significantly better than Lowry ever has or will be. Why would Lowry be worth so much more than that on a sign and trade?? I mean cmon no need to break the bank when the market value in a similar scenario was established. Also, Father Time is unbeaten and a championship from 3 seasons ago doesn’t meant anything today. Even Lebron is showing signs of slowing down massively at 36 years old. Don’t let the fact that Lowry is one of your favorite players cloud the obvious here."
"agreed he'd be a very strong backup center for a good even great bench mob. but he's good enough to demand starter money so we'll see. I was mad that the Suns let him walk to pursue Baynes + Ty Jerome (trade), but maybe it was because he wanted more mins on the Kings led us to let him walk"
"No, not at all. Shai should only be traded if an exceptional offer lands on the table. I don't like Siakam, No.4 and whatever filler enough to make that trade. Shai is the timeline for the Thunder and I don't see the point of acquiring more picks, I'd rather have good young players. Now, I think a trade involving Ty Jerome or Kenny Hustle, No.6 and a future pick is more feasible for No.4. A decent role player , a cost-controlled young player and a future asset for No.4 feels like fair value."
Ty Jerome will average about 10 points and 3 assists per game.
"Well I said they would be a decent fit not the best fit ever.   Out of the young SGs in the league, SGA would definitely be one of the best options beside Sexton. Sexton would also be an upgrade over Theo Maledon/Ty Jerome"
I asked for trade offers around the league for Ben Simmons in the NBA 2K22 franchise mode. Here were the three best offers:     * **Ben Simmons for Khris Middleton**    Don't know what the Bucks are thinking. They just won a championship and now they are trading one of their key pieces. Simmons and Antetokounmpo is some awful spacing.   * **Ben Simmons and Danny Green for Brandon Ingram and Garrett Temple**    Don't know what the Pelicans are thinking. This might be the last straw for Zion. Zion and Simmons is some awful spacing.     * **Ben Simmons and Andre Drummond for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Ty Jerome**    This is totally unrealistic. Presti isn't getting any picks.
"So I was looking into this a few weeks ago myself, and it turns out there are still two untied threads that started with the trade, at least on the Celtics' side.   In November of 2020, the Celtics were part of a three team trade with the blazers and grizzlies that sent Desmond bane to Memphis and enes Kanter to Portland, giving the Celtics two second round picks, one in 2023 and one in 2025. These are the last two threads. The Cs were only able to make this trade due to getting the rights to draft Desmond Bane in 2019 through a trade that sent Ty Jerome (and Aron Baynes) to the Suns. Ty Jerome (or at least his eventual draft rights, some of the available info is hard to track) was only able to be traded to the Suns due to the Celtics trading away the draft rights to Matisse Thybulle. They only had Thybulle's draft rights due to a trade with the grizzlies that sent Deyonta Davis and Rade Zagorac to Memphis. Zagorac came to the Celtics through the trading away of Brandon Wright, who came to the Celtics from the Mavericks in the Rondo (and Dwight Powell) deal, while Davis came to the Celtics via the trading away of MarShon Brooks and Celtics legend Jordan Crawford. And to finally tie this all up, Brooks was only on the Celtics because of the initial Pierce and KG trade.  The 2023 and 2025 picks are both second rounders, but it will be very interesting to see how the rest of the rippling effect plays out"
"While I agree I do wonder if maybe there's a sense of necessity/urgency as far as getting *something* good/great back for him just because outside of Embiid nothing has worked out for the Sixers.  1st rd picks going back to 2014 when they drafted Embiid:  2014 - Embiid, Elfrid Payton.  Embiid obviously a centerpiece, but Payton was never all that special and still isn't today.  2015 - Jahlil Okafor -  Do I really need say anything?  Wasted 3rd pick.  2016 - Simmons, TLC, Korkmaz.  Simmons has been a disappointment, soon to be traded.  Wasted 1st pick possibly, depends on if they get extremely lucky with a trade. TLC is an ok bench player in limited stretches but nothing special, same for Korkmaz  2017 - Fultz - Had the yips, got traded, is halfway decent now.  Not great, not terribly special, but just ""ok"".  Wasted 1st pick.  2018 - Bridges and Shamet.  Bridges immediately traded for rights to Zhaire Smith (who has played like 13 games total in 2 yrs for Philly).  Shamet was solid, but he's gone too.  2019 - Ty Jerome whose rights were traded for Matisse ""Career avgs of 4.3/1.8/1.1"" Thybulle.    2020 - Tyrese Maxey.  Solid young player with lots of potential, but he's got a ways to go.  Oh and don't forget that after 2018/19 they lost Jimmy Butler.  I wouldn't be surprised if they feel like the last 7 years of moves has left them with nothing to show for it other than Embiid and now they feel pressure to get something ""good"" for Simmons, otherwise they just keep wasting FRP's for nothing.  I mean, this is the type of performance the avg GM would be on the hot seat for...a bunch of lottery picks that turned out to be one superstar who likely won't be dominant for long thanks to injury-history and a bunch of flameouts who ended up getting traded for Dorito-crumbs and bench players."
this would have made sense if ty jerome and brandon clark played on the same college team
"I’m not reading all that, it’s about ty Jerome and Brandon Clarke."
That’s National Champion Ty Jerome to you
The race baiting isn't a very good look dude. You're taking a song about Ty Jerome and Brandon Clarke and trying to spin it into a debate about race just to satisfy your internet sjw keyboard warrior prerogative.
Pretty unbelievable the amount of hate you have for Ty Jerome and Brandon Clarke. You racist or something?
Bro looking back I never would have guessed ty Jerome would get more minutes than the god Brandon Clarke himself that’s good detail from Kanye
No it was talking about Ty Jerome and Brandon Clarke
Yep Ty Jerome and Brandon Clarke
No it was about Ty Jerome and Brandon Clarke
"why? it’s a really dumb reach lol. this sub is getting bad. like two weeks ago “wHaT iF nBA pLaYeRs wErE tHeIr nAmEs!” had like 5K upvotes and it was just some lazy shit like photoshopping Draymond to be green.   there’s potential for this to be funny, but OP just had to make a reach about two players, that were in college 8 years after the song and didn’t even play each other— this is just lame imo. Jerome isn’t even the player’s first name, it’s Ty. let’s not reward garbage like this"
*Is Ty Jerome caucasian?*
"Either Mike Muscala, Ty Jerome, or Darius Bazley"
Ty Jerome and some firsts should do it!
Which star is going for LeVert and Allen? Oh.  Which star is going for Bledsoe and RJ Hampton? Oh.  Which star is going for Ty Jerome and Kelly Oubre? Oh.  Which star is going for Montrezl Harrell and Kyle Kuzma? Oh.  Only in the last 12 months.
Ty jerome +28?!?
\+28 for Ty Jerome in 14 minutes holy hell
Ty Jerome; 14 min; 3 pts; 2 reb; 2 ast; 1 stl ... +28!
"Ty Jerome has this wonderful deep ""Fuck You"" 3 that is actually one of his sweet spots haha. He's proved he can hit that deep to us last year"
"Who doesn't know what +/- is? It's a pretty self explanatory stat.  The complexity is knowing not to read anything into it in isolation, without thinking about context (which should apply to every stat) - and particular as the other reply to you has stated, knowing that for a single game it probably doesn't tell you much, but over a season it can reflect some patterns worth talking about.  I also think OP seems to raise an interesting point. He (/she) is clearly not saying that Ty Jerome was the reason OKC won, but just it was interesting that for a guy who provided so little on the box score, he was on the floor for that entire run."
Ty Jerome +28 in 14 minutes is pretty epic.
One of the weirdest parts of what was a really weird game was watching Ty Jerome launch deep 3s like he had the greenest of green lights.
Dude Ty Jerome was +28 and he only played the second half. Only scored 3 points too lol.
"What the hell, how is Ty Jerome +28 in 14 minutes??"
"I did not watch this game, how the heck was Ty Jerome a +28?"
That Ty Jerome +/-...
How is Ty Jerome +28?
"Ty ""Out of the Rotation"" Jerome with a +28 fucking wow."
"Just checked the box score, who the hell is Ty Jerome and why does he have team high +28 in 14min?"
Who is the most underrated player in the NBA and why is it Ty Jerome
"Yea Bridges is definitely not getting a max. But CP3 did say he’s been the most impressive in terms of offseason development so if he is to take a good leap, better sign him now.  That being said, Ty Jerome was also highly praised in preseason but didn’t have a good rookie season so these comments are not always accurate."
"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is definitely a centerpiece-level player and Lu Dort is a legitimate playoff-rotation-level player.  Admittedly, though, Shai was a lucky acquisition considering how the PG13/Kawhi/Clippers stuff went down. Presti leveraged his position wonderfully, but it was a super unique acquisition that required a lot of other pieces to work out that way.  And Lu Dort was an undrafted rookie who bet on himself and it worked out wonderfully in our favor.  But otherwise we have a lot of assets and not as many legitimate pieces. Presti's done the ""easy"" part really well; the hard work is turning ""assets"" into actual players.  I'm very high on Josh Giddey, but things remain to be seen if players like Giddey, Aleksej Pokusevski, Darius Bazley, Theo Maledon, Ty Jerome, Tre Mann, and Jeremiah Robinson-Earl are actual winning basketball players or not.  Presti's amazing, but realistically speaking, he's done well with step one and we have a long way to go before we can call the rebuild a true success or not."
"He's barely 19 years old. He's not the finished product. We've seen with guys like Lonzo Ball that shooting form and consistency can be improved. If he was given the reigns as the Thunder's point guard, instead of spending a lot of time off the ball due to SGA, Ty Jerome, etc., and had teammates who could finish better, he'd be close to leading the NBA in assists as a teenaged rookie."
Kenrich Williams and perhaps a side of Ty Jerome
"The Suns are a good example too. They bottomed out after the 2017-18 season, and despite a rough 2018-19 season they were able to draft current key pillars for this team currently and for the long-run in Deandre Ayton (1st overall) and Mikal Bridges (10th overall) in the 2018 draft.  Devin Booker: drafted 13th overall in the 2015 NBA Draft  Deandre Ayton: drafted 1st overall in the 2018 NBA Draft  Mikal Bridges: drafted 10th overall in the 2018 NBA Draft  Cam Johnson: drafted 11th overall in the 2019 NBA Draft   Chris Paul (via Ricky Rubio, Kelly Oubre and TJ Warren): obtained via trade with Thunder along with Abdel Nader for Kelly Oubre, Ricky Rubio, Ty Jerome and a 1st round pick. Rubio meanwhile was obtained via free agency heading into the 2019-20 season via cap space obtained from trading away TJ Warren (drafted 14th overall in the 2014 NBA Draft) to the Pacers, while Oubre was obtained via trade with the Wizards in exchange for Trevor Ariza during the 2018-19 season.   Jae Crowder: signed via free agency prior to the 2020-21 season  Rubio and Warren are in many ways the catalyst to the Suns team and rebuild going swiftly after the 2017-18 season. The Suns being able to acquire Rubio allowed the Suns to play much-better basketball in the 2019-20 season (perhaps a playoff team if not for the Deandre Ayton suspension), which in turn allowed the Suns to be able to attract a star like Chris Paul to come to Phoenix (yeah he came via a trade, but that was more of a free agency type move than a trade).   The Suns however would not have been able to acquire Rubio if not for having TJ Warren and trading him away for cash and in essence cap space to the Pacers. The Suns were a very bad team in 2018-19 in large part due to having the worst point guard play in recent NBA history. By trading Warren away and signing Rubio (the Suns were in for Brogdon and Rozier before Rubio signed, so it was clear James Jones targeted a point guard), the Suns were able to sign a floor-raising point guard that helped improve their play and helped improve their reputation on the floor which has now led them to being one of the elite teams in the league right now.  It's a fascinating rebuild in a way."
The problem is we have no offense off the bench (Moose) outside of Ty Jerome but then again we're terrible regardless so I'd rather prioritize Giddey and JRE's development by putting up the best lineup we could and play them together
We'll take hami and one of your firsts and you can have Roby and Ty Jerome
"Come home Hami. You'll get playing time with us.  If Roby, Ty Jerome and Gabriel Deck can get playing time, he can."
"Giddey is doing that while not actually being given free reign to play the point, too. Giddey is spending a lot of time essentially as an off-ball 2 guard, with SGA, Ty Jerome, and Theo Maledon all getting minutes and touches on the ball at the point."
Shai and Giddey are both pretty good. Yall have Dejounte and they are getting routed buy Poku and Ty Jerome. Yall are getting throttled and embarrassed by the worst young core in the league.
"Zach Lowe, bunch of NBA media people and NBA twitter. I don't mean like as a contender but I mean their position as a young core. I don't see it they getting waxed by Poku and Ty Jerome."
my dude is really flexing that they traded those 2 PG's for JEremiah RObinson and Ty Jerome
I fully believe Jerome Robinson is not only in the league still but a contributing member of the Clippers if Ty Lue stepped into the head coaching role earlier btw
"Seeing that salary just reminded me what a wizard Sam Presti is. Gave Russ a huge contract as the face of the franchise, once his decline started, traded him, rehabbed Chris Paul, then traded him too.  So, in all, in exchange for Russell Westbrook, the Thunder ultimately have ended up with: Poku, Jeremiah Robinson-Earl, Ty Jerome, and FOUR MORE FIRST ROUNDERS (Suns 2022 pick, and Rockets 2024 &amp; 2026 picks and 2025 swap). All for Russ to turn into an albatross contract nobody wants."
In this case they clearly do. This man out here thinking Ty Jerome aint the goat
"This really only tells you that Ty Jerome was on the floor during OKC’s biggest runs. There were also 9 other players on the floor during these runs who could have made a big impact on Jerome’s +/- . Maybe Westbrook was chucking up bricks, maybe it was Shae playing like a god. Plus minus is really just a team stat disguised as an individual stat."
Ty Jerome actually hits his three's so of course the team does better with him out there versus a Maledon or someone else on the bench.
+/- stats are so flawed but yet get used so often.  Not to discredit Ty Jerome or anything. Didn’t watch the dude I’m sure he did good. Just a general statement.
"This is what I meant when I said players play 10% harder and smarter against the Lakers than they do most other teams.   It’s like an audition, everyone knows there is eyes on them. A post about Ty Jerome… only possible against the Lakers.  But it’s also why we get the superstar players and have 17 championships. Good trade off I guess."
Shout OUT to Ty Jerome. Only reason OKC stuck around in the 2nd quarter
#IMAGINE LOSING TO KENRICH WILLIAMS AND TY JEROME
This is turning out to be the ty Jerome show just like we were all expecting
Have no idea why he isn’t getting more minutes. I don’t need to see Ty Jerome try and play point
"Believe me, those questions have been asked multiple times over by Celtics fans everywhere.  I think that Grant’s a legit NBA role player, but it’s undeniable that so much more was possible and instead we’re where we are now.  Ainge picked Grant at 22 but he also had the 20th pick… with which he selected Matisse Thybulle, who he then traded to Philly for picks 33 (Carsen Edwards) and 24 (Ty Jerome, who he then traded to PHO with Aaron Baynes for… a protected 1st in 2020, freeing up cap space to sign Kemba, IIRC).  In Ainge’s defense I think they thought Herro would’ve been long gone once it got anywhere near their pick at 14.  But on the whole this is indicative of how Ainge had just botched the endgame of his final attempt to assemble another championship level roster.  It all could’ve gone so differently if Hayward’s ankle hadn’t snapped off just moments into his first game.  Had that roster been intact and living up to its promise then maybe Ainge would’ve pulled the trigger on trading his many assets into tangible NBA players.  Instead he resigned last year and everyone kind of agreed that it was time (if not overdue)."
None of them are pivotal players. I’d rather see how Giddey operates with less talented players than see Ty Jerome run point.
What a terrible game I can’t believe I watched that entire thing  Mavs announcers hilarious   Okc was really bad   Ty Jerome can shoot   Baze Lu and Shai very rough   Nothing to say
"A late, distant first.   OR  An early second + mid/late second.  OR  Young player (e.g. Ty Jerome level) + any old 2nd."
"That's 2019 Final Four All-Tourney team member, Ty Jerome, to you"
That’s UVA legend Ty Jerome to you
Yeah!...^*googles^Ty^Jerome*
Ty Jerome with a solid 9/5/7 in his Thunder debut. Not bad.
"They have a few other end of benchers - Anthony Gill, Ty Jerome, Kyle Guy"
I still can't believe we traded thybulle for edwards and ty jerome (who?)
"Yeah I see the baggage as mainly the Kemba contract, the cap situation (though in fairness some of that is allocated to the guys who are the other team's future), and the lack of assets to create flexibility.  As for draft capital, to me it's a matter of having made too many selections and seeing too many of those selections ultimately return 0 value. Like let's go all the way back to 2013 and the draft day when the Brooklyn trade happened.  In 2013, the C's pick Kelly Olynyk. He walks away for nothing in 2017.  In 2014, they pick Marcus Smart (indisputably a big fat W), but they also pick James Young, who flames out of the league almost immediately.  In 2015, they grab Rozier. Turns out he's a great pick, but ultimately he's dumped to get Kemba Walker, who has produced mixed results so far and will likely either leave in free agency or cost picks to move. He's followed up by RJ Hunter (out of the league), Jordan Mickey (out of the league), and Marcus Thornton (out of the league).  In 2016, the Brooklyn trade pays off in a big way and they take Jaylen Brown. Unfortunately, they hang onto the #16 and #23 pick# too long and they becomes cap casualties in the form of Yabu and Zizic as necessary draft-and-stashes who never develop into an NBA players. He does manage to turn two seconds into a Memphis 1st (from the Clippers). But that becomes the Thybulle selection in 2019 and turned into #24 (Ty Jerome) and #33 (Carsen Edwards). Jerome returned the #30 pick in 2020, which has since been turned back into two seconds. Edwards got a guaranteed deal for no real reason and likely will be out of the league soon.  The C's then still take 3 second round picks in this draft, two of whom drop out of the league (Demetrius Jackson, Ben Bentil). The other was Abdel Nader, who ultimately was dumped for Rodney Purvis, who was promptly waived.  2017 is another strong start with the Tatum selection. At 37, they also get Semi, who has over-performed for being drafted that late. But will he be here long-term? Or end up as another selection who walks away for nothing? Still not sure he belongs in a real contender's rotation. We also end up taking two more guys in the second round (Kadeem Allen and Jabari Bird) who do not play NBA basketball anymore.  In 2018, the last Brooklyn pick gets shipped out for Kyrie, who will leave for nothing. I don't blame Ainge for this one as I don't think many people understood what a headcase Kyrie actually was. They also get Robert Williams in this draft, which looks great so far.  I'm going to set aside the 2019 and 2020 drafts because they are too recent. But I will say the Edwards and Waters picks are really baffling and seemed destined to fail pretty early on. Why is the team so focused on getting undersized guards?  Anyway, the team has made so many draft selections, but aside from the three home runs and Kemba, they've turned into what 2 other guys that fans can feel confident may be rotation players (Robert and Pritchard)? We've got our fingers crossed that Langford and Nesmith will join them, but who knows. Maybe Semi and Grant can contribute, but they are so inconsistent still. That's why I feel those assets were mismanaged."
I love Ty Jerome but man did he really miscalculate the trajectory on that one
"Awesome pass, but what the hell was that feed from Ty Jerome?"
"Okc didn’t get a prospect for cp3 however no offense to ty Jerome.  It was a 1st, decent expiring(oubre) and slightly negative contract(Rubio) which they turned along with 2 late 1sts into a bad expiring and a mid 1st.  Add on even though cp3s on a bad contract and older, he was a little better than Lowry is now and has 2 years left.  I read on realgm that a team that trades for Lowry can’t resign him now and that’s a huge deal.  Think raptors fans on here are asking for a bit too much looking for a first and a good prospect unless the other salary is bad.    I’m talking like Gary Harris as the bad contract Barton as expiring and a 1st and Denver still is only attaching like bol bol.  Realgm trade board(suggest people check it out) also threw out stuff like just Lowry for Drummond and a prospect/1st and rarely include maxey in any Danny green deal."
