"In no particular order it's probably Quickley, the top 3 picks, Haliburton, Desmond Bane has been shooting super well, Pritchard had some great games and should be getting back from his injury soon, Tyrese Maxey was kinda balling when the sixers needed him to step up, Patrick Williams seems solid, and then Precious Achiuwa seems good whenever I see him? Idk I'm probably missing someone, but sure is 10 good rookies"
"I gotta say, Desmond Bane does a lot of stuff really really well. Great find from the Grizzlies. Nightmare matchup for the Grizzlies defensively though. They really have no defensive big men."
"Quickley, Wiseman, Lamelo, Haliburton, Cole Anthony, Edwards, Patrick Williams, JaeSean Tate, and I guess Desmond Bane and Xavier Tillman?"
"Firmly in the spooky category but they actually have a chance at success unlike say, the Pelicans.  I think they're a great wing player away though. They have a TON of guard depth and they're slotting some of the bigger 2-guards at the 3 to get minutes (i.e. Desmond Bane, John Konchar) - I'd look to cash in on a couple of those guys if someone interesting becomes available."
Memphis is an easy team to root for.  Also they're extremely loaded in backcourt depth it's kind of bonkers.  PG: Ja / Tyus Jones  SG: Dillon Brooks / DeAnthony Melton / Grayson Allen  SF: Kyle Anderson / Desmond Bane / John Konchar  They basically have so many shooting guards that they're slotting the bigger ones in the wing slot. And remember they still have Justise Winslow.  I could see them consolidating their depth for another good wing in the future.
Hell Desmond Bane is leading the NBA in 3P% and doesn’t even start on his own team when they only have 10 bodies available
Desmond Bane
"2020 was the supposed ""quiet"" draft but it's really produced a ton of great rookies  the top 3 all look solid Tyrese Maxey  Immanuel Quickly  Tyrese Haliburton  Payton Pritchard  That's at least 7 solid NBA players with some of them showing star potential. Then there are still dudes like Cole Anthony, Deni Avidja, Desmond Bane. Like 10 players that might make a career is a pretty good draft. It's definitely no 2018 but the potential still has yet to fully reveal itself."
Psssssst Desmond Bane leads the league in 3PT%
"Xavier Tillman, Desmond Bane, and Theo Maledon were all on the board  Flynn never made sense and I'll die on that hill. feelsbadman."
I mean I think both players are just fringe rotation players so I don't really care. I am not broken up about 'missing' Desmond Bane. Xavier Tillman on the other hand? Yeah.
"He does look like a rookie most the time, in terms of being a tiny bit lost, and a bit off-speed. There have been some pretty bad lapses on defense with switches I've noticed.    But overall Bane has been fantastic with what he's shown. And it definitely feels like he's starting to get some amount of comfort on the court. I like that foul-line jumper he's gotten to a couple of times. Almost appears to be a copy of Dillion's movement. Any time Desmond takes an on-balance shot from off the dribble, or a catch and shoot, I feel good about that possession."
Desmond Bane is gunning for that SG spot
Desmond Bane is an absolute sniper. Insanely good player for 30th overall
Desmond Bane has a fucking sniper rifle
Desmond Bane sounds like he should be a Gothic count.
current grizzlies rookie Desmond bane deserves an honorable mention
first: IQ Tyrese Hali Wiseman(ROY) Lamelo Pat Will  Second:  Devin Vassell Desmond Bane Tyrese Maxey Cole Anthony Xavier Tillman  Just missed: Payton Pritchard(would be in it if he wasn’t hurt) Precious Achiuwa Ant Edwards Saddiq Bey Isaiah Stewart Mason Jones
"I have literally never seen LeBron lie down on the court in the middle of ongoing play without an injury.   Schroder has been a good player for exactly 1 season in his career. It's not like he has a track record of being good. Also, that late first rounder could've been Desmond Bane who looks amazing right now."
"Balls, glen rice, Jordan Bell, Kemba Walker, Desmond bane"
"I'm specifically talking about trading up to draft Brandon Clarke, Desmond Bane and Xavier Tillman, all players who were undervalued draft day but have turned into instant contributers. Esp Clarke who was All-Rookie and Bane who is shooting 45+% from 3 on 4 attempts per game when Grizz needed a shooter   As well as smart trade acquisitions such as getting De'Anthony Melton (6th man and analytics darling last year) and Josh Jackson in a salary dump from Suns and getting Igudola from Warriors then flipping him for Justise Winslow. And their trade for Mike Conley resulted in Grayson Allen, Jae Crowder (also flipped for Winslow) and two 1sts, one of whom tuned into Clarke.  People really don't understand how much work this FO has done to remake the roster into smart young players that all fit together. Yes they got very lucky with Ja and JJJ but to get to this point only 3 years removed from Grit n Grind playoff teams is incredible."
"Brandon Clarke, Dillon Brooks are both home runs outside the lottery (and they moved up for Clarke), and this year Desmond Bane and X Tillman (and they moved up for both, I believe). Also Konchar."
Grizzlies keep drafting my favorite prospects every year lol first it was JJJ then JA now Desmond Bane and Tillman
"Xavier Tillman is a fuckin dog. He has a nice floater, shown a good post move or two, and isn't scared of the corner three  Desmond Bane has a reeeaaalllly nice touch. He has pulled up from mid range a few times and swished it and of course his three ball is solid. He has good defensive potential but has gotten lost a few times. The rest of the guard stuff like handle, finishing inside, and playmaking is a little rough."
"Desmond Bane and Xavier Tillman are fighting each other for steal of the draft. Both have looked fantastic for where they were drafted, both are very high IQ players on both ends of the floor, and Bane is an absolute sharp shooter from the arc, he’s hitting nearly 50% from 3. We’ve nailed the draft for the second year in a row"
Call it a hot take if you want but I’m very high on both JJJ and Ja to the point that I think they are gonna be title contenders within 2-3 seasons. Also think Desmond Bane is gonna be a borderline all star every time I watch him he reminds me a combo between young Eric Gordon/Rookie Malcom Brogdon.
"Team: Grizzlies  Desmond Bane = #30 overall. Been pretty much exactly what we expected and wanted out of him. Bench player who can shoot the 3 well. Averaging 8.6 PPG while shooting 48.9% from 3 on 3.6 attempts per game. He's absolute lived up to the billing as a lethal three point shooter.  Xavier Tillman = #35 overall. Been really good as well. He's been very good defensively. Shown the ability to switch onto players and has played well against bigs. He got beat up a bit by Ayton because of his lack of height, but as a long term backup big, he's a good player.   I've been really happy with both Bane and Tillman so far."
"That Memphis pick had much more speculative value than it did actual value. I got shat on in the Celtics sub for saying it should've been traded for something.  I think Ainge should've been more willing to take high-floor, low-ceiling prospects. I get that you're loaded on the wing for starters, but you all could've had Brandon Clarke and Desmond Bane to be your frontcourt second unit and would've been ready to contribute."
Desmond Bane in Memphis deserves an honorable mention  https://www.instagram.com/p/CHvkzWCpi_Z/
Why'd the rest of the league let Desmond Bane fall to 30?
Desmond Bane is just good. Grizz embraced the meme as draft twitter darlings
"I literally don't understand how Zach Kleiman can enter a draft with one second round pick and leave it with Desmond Bane and Xavier Tillman, two players ready to contribute to winning basketball immediately.  He's a wizard"
Desmond Bane
"I think Ainge really missed out the opportunity over the past few years to go for some high-floor, low-ceiling complimentary guys who can keep the bench unit afloat either Tatum/Brown are sitting. You all passed on Brandon Clarke and Desmond Bane in favor of one-way players."
"They really do, but I'll be the first to admit that I've never been impressed with Romeo at all and I watched him at IU.  He's been banged up ever since he's been in the NBA and he has a broken shot form. Boston fans will tell you he's a plus defender but Boston's entire bench is 1-way defensive players (Langford, Grant Williams, Ojelye) and their offense tanks when either Tatum or Brown aren't in the rotation.  Hindsight's 20/20, but if they have their star wings already drafted they should've went for some high-floor, low-ceiling complimentary options in the draft like Brandon Clarke and Desmond Bane."
"Man he'd be a perfect fit next to Ja and JJJ  I think the best we could give em would be Brandon Clarke, Desmond Bane, Dillon Brooks, Kyle Anderson, and a bunch of picks which probably isn't gonna scratch that itch."
I guess that means Desmond Bane will have to break Kyrie
Good to see isiah joe out there he and jordan nwora was one of the guys i wanted us to draft before we drafted desmond bane
"Why are we comparing them?   LeBron is playing better than Desmond Bane, but nobody's taking about it."
Desmond Bane at Memphis is shooting 40%+ on threes and had multiple threes in the first 6 games.
"I wasn't a fan of the Nesmith pick before he started playing. Him and Langford were both confounding picks at the time given the other talent on the board. Not to mention they traded the pick that was Desmond Bane, who is a better version of Nesmith and more NBA ready at the 30th pick.   Championship Windows are short and whiffing on the 14th pick 2 years in a row isn't going to help."
"I think Ainge has kind of shit the bed in the past few drafts tbh.  It's early to call on a lot of the players yeah, but last year you all passed on Thybulle, Sekou and Brandon Clarke.  This year it was Nesmith for any of the other wings and I think you all made a mistake trading the 30th pick when Desmond Bane was still on the board."
"As a general rule, lottery prospects are drafted based on their potential, not their NBA-readiness. There's much more of a FO willingness to take a very raw prospect if they think he'll turn out to be a star; high risk high reward.  So it makes sense that a high-floor, low-ceiling guy like Tyrese fell. In addition to that, there were some concerns about his athleticism and weird shooting form.  But honestly I think a lot of those concerns are overrated and people continue to underestimate how good a high-floor rookie can be. Look at Payton Prichard and Desmond Bane; both are 4-year guards that are putting in work for their teams right now."
"Brandon Clarke, Desmond Bane, and Dillon Brooks all have negative wingspans"
I love these uniforms almost as much as I love Desmond Bane.
I'm still kind of annoyed we traded Desmond Bane for basically nothing.
Desmond Bane is currently playing himself into the starting lineup and more people need to be talking about him
"I wanted Desmond Bane with the 20th pick, who is doing great in limited minutes on the Grizz bench.  However, I am very pleased with Precious Achiuwa"
"Really proud of the effort from such a ragtag group. Shades of goonsquad. Once the Lakers decided to put things away in the 4th, there was nothing that could be done. Desmond Bane looks better each game, and his shot is money."
Desmond Bane was an absolute steal with the 30th pick.
Man the rookie of the year race between Desmond Bane and Xavier Tillman is going to be contentious...
I really like Desmond Bane
Desmond Bane is jacked
Desmond Bane.
Gary Trent. Keldon Johnson and now the 3rd all star starter - Desmond bane.
"I try to use BClarke when I'm outside of the Grizz sub, but commonly Grizzlies fans in our subreddit speak about players in 3 letters or less.  Ja, JV, JJJ, BC, DB  And DB is the MOST confusing because we all know DB is Dillon Brooks but now we have Desmond Bane as well"
Meanwhile Memphis has these 2 four-year college guys in Desmond Bane and John Konchar who look great. Something to be said about playing for 4 years against bigger bodies
"I think it was always a deep draft. A lot of guys have came in and helped their teams, even some late picks second rounders.   Pritchard has been great for the Celtics. Theo Maledon has looked very good. Xavier Tillman and Desmond Bane are effective rotation players and spot starters for a .500 team. Immanuel Quickley looks like he's gonna be a very good player. Isaiah Joe from Philly is still very raw but when they needed a shooter to insert into the lineup he played generally well.   And then I think there's quite a couple more second rounders who will become solid rotation players. Saben Lee has had some good flashes for Detroit, Paul Reed is tearing up the  G League for Philly.   All of those guys picked 20+, and then add on Wiseman, Patrick Williams, Lamelo, Halibuton with all-star potential and then Bey, Achiuwa, Maxey from non-lottery picks showing future starter ability. It's a good draft, and there's always going to be late bloomers as well"
Desmond Bane
"Grizzlies payroll in general is pretty good. Next year, they should have around $10 million in cap space, and the only player on an expiring deal is Gorgui Dieng. In 2022/23, they'll have Dillon Brooks, Ja Morant, Melton, Brandon Clarke, John Konchar, Desmond Bane, Jontay Porter, and Xavier Tillman signed. For a combined $45 million.   A lot of that unused cap space will probably be used to re-sign dudes like JJJ, Winslow, Tyus Jones, etc. But I feel like that's a pretty good group of players to have for relatively cheap."
Desmond Bane would be a good add for sure
"I think the TT acquisition was fine but that doesn't excuse poor roster construction.   I felt like I've had a few conversations with Celtics fans recently who've made the comment: ""Who could we have traded for?"". For the record I'm on board with not dumping one of the Jays/Smart in a rental. That's fine.  To the Celtics defense, the roster construction over the past few years has not lead itself to making any impactful trades. The Jays are untouchable, Smart is probably untouchable and Theis' production relative to his contract doesn't give them any incentive to trade him. That being said, that can be pointed at as bad roster construction.  If we want to look at it from a hindsight prospective, we can easily see that if Rozier and Morris were causing locker room issues they should have been traded instead of letting them stay until the offseason. This was also a time with both the Sac and Memphis pick had more speculative value than they'd actually come to have - what I'm getting at it is the Celtics could've gotten somebody who fit the system better.  Also not to shit on Kemba but once has to wonder if they took that max money and signed some cheaper, more complimentary pieces. Ricky Rubio went for 17M/year for example. You could've gotten him, a good sixth man and another complimentary guy for the price you paid Kemba. That would've also let to having more trade-able assets down the line.  As I mentioned, this is all hindsight too but if you were going to sign Kemba Walker and put yourself into a position where you can't effectively salary match (which doesn't go well with the fact that they had a warchest of draft picks and untouchable players) then the least you could've done over the past few years is draft older, more complimentary guys that were ready to contribute immediately next to your core.  Brandon Clarke, Matisse Thybulle, Desmond Bane - all players that Ainge either missed out on or literally traded away.  I'll give credit where credit is due - Payton was a smart choice in that vein and I'm willing to give Nesmith the benefit of the doubt as I think he has a great ceiling of a 3&amp;D wing.  And don't give me shit about Romeo Langford not being ready - I've watched him since IU; can't shoot for shit and can't stay healthy. Bust potential is big."
Desmond Bane is 10th in 3%?

"Memphis.  Ja, JJJ, Brandon Clarke, Desmond Bane, Xavier Tillman.  My goodness."
"It's NOT P/A/R!  Also, the disrespect to Desmond Bane..."
"You're neglecting a few of those:  2016 Dallas 1st: Yabusele. That was an intentional draft and stash for Horford but my God that pick essentially went to waste. I imagine he could've gotten some better future assets for a first that was right outside of the lottery. A lot of great players went late in the first round of that draft.  2019: I've watched Langford since IU and I'm not convinced he'll amount to anything. He can't shoot for shit and he's injury prone. They drafted Thybulle and gave him away to Philly for some seconds. Grant Williams is meh.  2020: I'm willing to give Nesmith a benefit of the doubt and Payton has been a big relief, but giving away Desmond Bane sucks.   Ainge had what, 6 FRPs within the last 3 drafts? Especially with those being later picks, I think he should've gone all-in on older players ready to contribute. Brandon Clarke was absolutely worth a lottery selection in 2019. Letting some experienced players in Thybulle and Bane walk were dumb decisions.   And it goes without saying that both the Sac and Memphis firsts had much more speculative value than actual value. I got eviscerated in the Celtics sub for suggesting that the Memphis pick should've been traded.   Should the Celtics have gone all-in for a superstar? Probably not - they got their MJ and Pippen duo with the Jay's and that's worth keeping. But, Ainge has squandered the rest of the assets in trying to surround his stars with proper players."
"Desmond Bane and Xavier Tillman have been unbelievably solid. Bane is a certified sniper and Tillman reminds me of brandon Clarke’s rookie year. Just always in the right spots and making the right plays. Bane needs to work on his ball handling in transition a little bit, tends to get sloppy with the dribble and look out of control at times. But he’s been surprisingly good at driving and finishing for the most part. I had no idea he had that tbh. Idk what to say about Tillman other that he just makes winning plays."
Desmond Bane
"Hindsight's 20/20 but Ainge missed hard on drafting the past two years.  If you have your established trio of Tatum/Brown/Smart then he should've been more receptive to drafting older prospects who could've contributed immediately.  2019 - Drafted Romeo Langford and Grant Williams over Brandon Clarke and Matisse Thybulle (hell, they traded Thybulle to the 76ers for Carsen fucking Edwards lmao)  2020 - Traded away Desmond Bane. Saddiq Bey is obviously shining right now but I'm willing to give Nesmith the benefit of the doubt. As an IU fan I have no idea why Romeo Langford was a lottery pick. He's barely played and the best value he'll ever have to Boston is being traded for Harrison Barnes.  Honorable mention - Guerschon Yabusele at #16 in 2016 over literally anybody else (Caris LeVert, Pascal Siakam, Malcolm Brogdon, Dejountae Murray)"

It's obviously a hindsight take, but Ainge could've drafted Thybulle, Brandon Clarke, Saddiq Bey and Desmond Bane over the past few years. If you've established your core with Tatum/Brown/Smart then there's no reason not to take a chance on older prospects who could contribute immediately."
"Again, No he wasnt. Desmond Bane has been leading in rookie shooting since the first week of the season... nice try tho... you literally made the stat up out of thin air like a child"
Desmond Bane 1) has a cool ass name 2) is super jacked 3) shot the shit out of the ball in college. Nice pick by the Grizzles
are you in middle school? Your team is 7-19 and Bey isnt the best shooting rookie statistically you made that up out of thin air... desmond Bane has him beat by more than .060 and Nesmith would get playing time if he was on the sorry ass Pistons lol but keep riding that high horse nobodies crying but Blake Griffins empty ass legs “keep crying” “oooh salty” children like you ruin this sub more and more every day one good game and hes the next great coming player LOL Youd think the Knicks were title frontrunners two weeks into the season if this sub had any clue what they were talking about
"Congratulations, Lakers. You came out not wanting to play basketball and we scorched you 22-2.   Then the referees decided to get involved.  It shouldn't take 29 to 8 free throws for the reigning champs to hang with the Grizzlies playing without JJJ, Justise, Brandon Clarke, Desmond Bane, Deanthony Melton, Sean McDermott, and Killian Tillie."
Grizzlies Injury Report  Jaren Jackson Jr OUT  Brandon Clarke OUT  De'Anthony Melton OUT  Justise Winslow OUT  Desmond Bane OUT  Lovely.
"First Team: Lamelo Ball, Tyrese Haliburton, Immanuel Quickley, Patrick Williams, James Wiseman   Second Team: Cole Anthony, Desmond Bane, Anthony Edwards, Devin Vassell, Jae'Sean Tate"
I think that by the end of the season Desmond Bane will be on one of those teams.  I swear he’s been putting up pretty good numbers and nobody gives af lol
That desmond bane 3 from deep was super wet
"Not just Kyle Anderson, Desmond Bane had a career high, and the Grizzlies had a franchise record 23 threes."
"Yeah the celtics definitely would have had to trade brown or tatum to get a star, it's not like they have wasted 7 first round picks on Robert Williams, Grant Williams, Matisse Thybulle (traded), Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, and Desmond Bane (traded) in the past 3 years 😂😂😂. Definitely can't trade draft picks 😂😂"
"Ja took a tough collision three games ago at the end of the game and his last two games he's been pretty passive in the first half. Still contributing his normal assist averages and playing better defense, still not good tho.  The story has been how Grayson Allen, Desmond Bane, and Deanthony Melton have been sharpshooters."
"20-30 in this draft was pretty good.  Precious Achiwa, Maxey, Pritchard, Quickley, McDaniels, Desmond Bane."
Desmond Bane is such a good 3 and D wing... and everyone KNEW he was gonna be good... how did he fall that far in the draft
Love to see Desmond Bane on this list every week
Desmond Bane and Deanthony Melton are top 10 in 3pt% while Melton leads in +/-. I'll wouldn't trade our bench for anyone elses.
Desmond Bane is already top 10 in the NBA in 3P%
Desmond Bane is gonna fuck around and make 1st Team All Rookie
"I'm not asking ""who's better now"" I'm saying, where do you think people who guess when he was picked ?   I mean Desmond Bane is better than Wiseman, but you'd never think a 22 year old spot up shooter wouldve gone before a 19 yr old 7 footer who is athletic."
Desmond Bane had been making a push for 1st team as of the last three weeks.
"I mean yeah he's hit well on his top 10 picks but I think he really flubbed the past two drafts.   Cap-wise he put the Celtics into a position with maxing Kemba that meant they couldn't make any real trades (no tradeable contracts for salary matching). If you have your core of Kemba/Smart/the Jays then he should've doubled down more on drafting older, ready-to-contribute guys like Payton Prichard.   He traded away both Matisse Thybulle and Desmond Bane, hard pills to swallow. Also Romeo Langford has bust potential written all over him; I would've taken Brandon Clarke in a heartbeat."
Desmond Bane is like if Cam Johnson was drafted at the spot Cam was actually mocked at. 0 surprise Bane is doing really well being as good a shooter as he is.
Kind of reminds me of Malcolm Brogdon when he came into the league. I wanted the Bucks to draft Desmond Bane too lol
"since the nets trade I'd say the only definite hit so far (only counting first rounders) was rozier, but rob williams III and payton pritchard look really promising. for grant williams it's probably too early to see but it looks bad so far. desmond bane and matisse thybulle look like steals but we traded them. and then james young, rj hunter, and yabu were misses. if i haven't missed any picks thats a 5-4 record of solid-to-good picks outside the lottery in round 1. as an extremely biased fan I'd say thats not too bad. would've loved if more than 2 of those 5 were actually on our team tho, thanks mr. daniel ray ainge"
"Desmond bane should be on here, unless you're doing over 40 games (he played 40)"
"It's a complex combination of shit luck and poor roster construction in my opinion.  Ainge had a contending roster with Kyrie and Hayward but Kyrie's a headcase and Gordon snapped his leg. Then prior to last season it became an issue of too many mouths to feed and didn't lead to roster cohesion.  It was the right move to make room for both of the Jays to be the face of the team moving forward but I still think Ainge has done a poor job constructing a roster around them. For the record I'm on board with not trading either of those guys for a superstar rental, but on the flip side Ainge sat on his hands with all of the draft assets within the past few years and doesn't have much to show for it.  A common retort I've heard from Celtics fans is, ""Who could we have traded for?""  To the Celtics defense, the roster construction over the past few years has not lead itself to making any impactful trades. The Jays are untouchable, Smart is probably untouchable and Theis' production relative to his contract doesn't give them any incentive to trade him. That being said, that can be pointed at as bad roster construction.  If we want to look at it from a hindsight prospective, we can easily see that if Rozier and Morris were causing locker room issues they should have been traded instead of letting them stay until the offseason.

I'll give credit where credit is due - Payton was a smart choice in that vein and I'm willing to give Nesmith the benefit of the doubt as I think he has a great ceiling of a 3&amp;D wing.  And don't give me shit about Romeo Langford not being ready - I've watched him since IU; can't shoot for shit and can't stay healthy. Bust potential is big."
Desmond Bane
"For the record, I've said for two years that Teague is 100% awful, and yes, Grant looked better last year - but again - why did Ainge draft Mat.Tyb - and then trade him for G league backup Carson Edwards?  Same with Desmond Bane - what did they get for him?  Put those 2 on the bench for the Celtics and they easily have 6-8 more wins."
"My name is not as cool as ""Desmond Bane""."
I could be Desmond Bane.  You could be Desmond Bane.  Someone pay me 6 figures to miss two shots and get one foul :(
"Maxey right now is down 1 tier for me with guys like Saddiq Bey, Desmond Bane, Kira Lewis, Patrick Williams, and Okoro. Flashed potential and has a future in the league but still is battling for his role. Give him time and I think he will have a nice career though."
Who is Desmond bane?
Dude for a 3and d player Desmond bane is jacked as fuck. Might actually be bane.
"I’m convinced Desmond Bane could be a professional bodybuilder if he wanted. His triceps are freakish, I assume he has great genetics"
"Quickley, Desmond Bane, Saddiq Bey.  But those are all the players the Mavs could have gotten instead of Josh Green sooooooooo"
Desmond Bane is literally the DC villain Bane levels of ripped but y’all ain’t ready for that conversation
Desmond Bane really only cost us 2 second rounders. He’s a perfect fit with this Grizz team. I look forward to when we add Kispert in the draft.
Desmond Bane cost two second-rounders. Zach Kleiman is a god
Desmond Bane making his 1st Team All Rookie case. Dude is the perfect 3 and D guy for this team.
"I mean, if your options are trading them for peanuts or drafting a cost controlled pack of peanuts, whats the difference? They've traded away some picks pretty flippantly, honestly. Trading Desmond Bane to get off Kanter's $5m contract sticks as a recent example.  He did get greedy. He kept all of his assets for one of two trades; Paul George or Anthony Davis. The George one he got done in by awful timing, thanks to Isiah's injury. If he was all-good, they don't have to trade for Kyrie to address that issue and can instead re-route more assets elsewhere, meaning they wouldn't have had to put the eggs in the Hayward basket and wait for him to sign, effectively taking them out of the PG market.  Then Anthony Davis just rightfully didn't want to come. Ainge didn't get stingy, he just took a big risk to hold out for the star and then when that star didn't come... the whole league knew the position they were in and NO ONE would take the picks for more than 20cents on the dollar.  This is just what happens with promising young teams with lots of assets, man. You can be so prepared and have all the assets but it's still so hard to take that team to the next level... promising futures fizzle away so often. You need lightning to strike to be great, and it just didn't with this team, despite Ainge standing outside waving his lightning rod around."
"Smart, rozier, brown, and Tatum went 6, 16, 3, 3. Since the Tatum draft, their first round picks have been:  2018: Robert Williams, 26th  2019: Romeo Langford, 14th. Matisse Thybulle, 20th (traded to philly). Grant Williams, 22nd.   2020: Aaron Nesmith, 14th. Payton Pritchard, 26th. Desmond Bane, 30th (traded to Memphis)  So basically your whole point was just trying to say that when you draft in the lottery, it’s easier to have good picks than when you draft in the teens and twenties lol. Hard hitting analysis buddy, thank you."
"Literally just in the last 3.5 years   -  June 19, 2017: Traded a 2017 1st round draft pick (Markelle Fultz was later selected) to the Philadelphia 76ers for a 2017 1st round draft pick (Jayson Tatum was later selected) and a 2019 1st round draft pick (Romeo Langford was later selected)  - July 7, 2017: Traded Avery Bradley and a 2019 2nd round draft pick (Isaiah Roby was later selected) to the Detroit Pistons for Marcus Morris.  - August 30, 2017: Traded Jae Crowder, Isaiah Thomas, Ante Žižić, a 2018 1st round draft pick (Collin Sexton was later selected) and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Skylar Mays was later selected) to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Kyrie Irving.   - July 6, 2019: Traded Aron Baynes and Ty Jerome to the Phoenix Suns for a 2020 1st round draft pick (Desmond Bane was later selected). (top-7 protected)  - July 6, 2019: Traded Terry Rozier and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Grant Riller was later selected) to the Charlotte Hornets for Kemba Walker and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Yam Madar was later selected)."
"Okoro, Jaden McDaniels, Payton Pritchard, Xavier Tillman have all also been better defensively in my opinion. That also doesn't include players I think are more arguable but are there is also Desmond Bane, James Wiseman, Patrick Williams, and Saddiq Bey."
"Hey, this is revisionist history, dude. We traded down for the Sixers' first *plus* the Edwards pick, then flipped that to Phoenix to clear Aron Baynes' contract space for Kemba, plus one of the Suns' 2020 picks.  ...which we ended up using to draft Desmond Bane and then give him away for nothing, a pretty big L in its own right. Still, if we'd kept Matisse we would've done the same thing, so we basically got Edwards for free."
And Desmond Bane! Riding his way to an All-Rookie team right now.
desmond bane
"We have a big glut of guys in that 2/3 spot. Dillon Brooks, Grayson Allen, Desmond Bane, and DeAnthony Melton are all fighting for minutes in that area. And each of them has shown that they deserve minutes.   It's one of the things this Grizz team has going for and also against it. We have a lot of good, but not great players. Ja and Jaren are our only 2 great players. The rest of the team is filled in with legitimately GOOD basketball players. But it's hard to find them all minutes. Like every team would love to have these guys, especially on their current salary, but they can only take us so far. So I'm hoping that we can either find one of these guys to be the 3rd star player, or we package a few of these guys and picks for another potentially great player.   I'm not sure how far it goes, but a package of Brandon Clarke, dealer's choice of Melton/Bane/Allen, salary filler, and 2 first round picks might be enough to get us someone else to be the dynamic wing we still need.   A starting lineup of Ja, Dillon Brooks, ""hypothetical traded for player"", JJJ, and Valanciunas/Xavier Tillman would be an excellent lineup for this team to go forward with."
"Memphis Grizzlies general manager Zach Kleiman proudly waited outside the visiting locker room after the final buzzer to give Ja Morant and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Tuesday night. Injured forward Jaren Jackson Jr. yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Desmond Bane gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard DeAnthony Melton yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Ja hit the locker room door, former Memphis great Tony Allen hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
I might be biased but I was thinking the same thing... Are Desmond Bane and Patrick Williams really putting up better numbers than him as a whole??
1. Anthony Edwards  2. LaMelo Ball  3. Tyrese Haliburton  4. Facundo Campazzo  5. Saddiq Bey  6. Immanuel Quickley  7. Jae'Sean Tate  8. Patrick Williams  9. Cole Anthony  10. Desmond Bane
Desmond Bane was the 30th overall pick lmao
"The point that you're missing there is that the team trading away the star player then gets saddled with a bunch of low value picks that they then stockpile to trade for the next wantaway star and so on and so on the cycle continues.   It's like a Ponzi scheme, and eventually those picks have to be selected, and can't be traded as hypothetical future assets anymore, and you end up like Boston - a supposed contender scrapping for 6th place in the East after being stuck with 3 relatively worthless first round picks and drafting Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard and Desmond Bane, none of whom move the needle towards winning a title in the short term.  So I'll repeat, why does anybody want to trade their star for these worthless picks?"
"It's a complex combination of shit luck and poor roster construction in my opinion.  2018-2019 was the high point with that stocked roster. But, Kyrie's headcase and Gordon snapped his leg. There was also the issue of too many mouths to feed with people like Marcus Morris and Terry Rozier wanting their touches.  It was the right move to make room for both of the Jays to be the face of the team moving forward but I still think Ainge has done a poor job constructing a roster around them. For the record I'm on board with not trading either of those guys for a superstar rental, but on the flip side Ainge sat on his hands with all of the draft assets within the past few years and doesn't have much to show for it.  A common retort I've heard from Celtics fans is, ""Who could we have traded for?""  To the Celtics defense, the roster construction over the past few years has not lead itself to making any impactful trades. Kemba is a bad contract, the Jays are untouchable, Smart is probably untouchable and while Theis massively outperformed his contract they traded him at the deadline just to get under the tax. That being said, this can all be pointed at as bad roster construction.  If we want to look at it from a hindsight prospective, we can easily see that if Rozier and Morris were causing locker room issues they should have been traded instead of letting them stay until the offseason. This was also a time with both the Sac and Memphis pick had more speculative value than they'd actually come to have - what I'm getting at it is the Celtics could've gotten somebody who fit the system better / more draft assets.  Also not to shit on Kemba but once has to wonder if they took that max money and signed some cheaper, more complimentary pieces. Ricky Rubio went for 17M/year for example. You could've gotten him, a good sixth man and another complimentary guy for the price you paid Kemba. That would've also let to having more trade-able assets down the line.  As I mentioned, this is all hindsight too but if you were going to sign Kemba Walker and put yourself into a position where you can't effectively salary match (which doesn't go well with the fact that they had a warchest of draft picks and untouchable players) then the least you could've done over the past few years is draft older, more complimentary guys that were ready to contribute immediately next to your core.  Brandon Clarke, Matisse Thybulle, Desmond Bane - all players that Ainge either missed out on or literally traded away.  I'll give credit where credit is due - Payton was a smart choice in that vein and I'm willing to give Nesmith the benefit of the doubt as I think he has a great ceiling of a 3&amp;D wing.  And don't give me shit about Romeo Langford not being ready - I've watched him since IU; can't shoot for shit and can't stay healthy. I get that it's been a rough season but the dude is looking like Kris Dunn right now. Bust potential"
"Yeah they’re the deepest team imo. They have 7 pretty good players off the bench.   Tyus Jones is one of the best backup PGs in the league.   DeAnthony Melton is probably one of the best defensive guards in the league, add in his secondary playmaking and much improved shooting, and he should be starting.   Justise Winslow is struggling offensively but he is great defensively. Very versatile too.   Desmond Bane is the best shooter in the rookie class. He’s a good defender and secondary ball handler as well. Awesome player.   Brandon Clarke was first team all rookie last year. He’s a monster rim runner with excellent touch and great defense.   JJJ might be the best player on the Grizzlies once he’s healthy.   Xavier Tillman is another excellent rookie, he’s impossible to score on in the paint, he’s a great passer, and the shooting is better than expected.   That’s crazy"
"You're missing the Grizzlies, honestly.  They have a star point guard and very capable back-up PG in Morant and Tyus Jones.  As an OKC-Jazz fan, I envy their options at SG: two-way menace Dillon Brooks, sharpshooter Grayson Allen, advanced stats darling and defensive ace DeAnthony Melton, flamethrower-type of shooter Desmond Bane and John Konchar who is a lot better than people realize since he's buried down the depth chart (he could be a reliable regular back-up on some teams).  At small forward, they have options due to Justise Winslow (who's in a slump) and Kyle Anderson. But this is the only position where they could use more strength, even though Brooks, Konchar and Bane could play the position in a small-ball lineup.  Big man/PF rotation is something to envy: one of the most underrated centers in Valanciunas, potential star JJJ, Tillman, Clarke, even Jontay Porter is somewhat interesting as a prospect (would looove to have him on Jazz or OKC).  Honestly, hats off to their GM."
"it was also fairly deep too surprisingly. Isaiah Stewart has been good, Quickley looks like a solid player with a well-rounded skill set, maxey is intriguing, Pokusevski, Sadiiq Bey, Desmond Bane, Theo Maledon, Kenyon Martin Jr having made some impact already"
Desmond Bane. Dude’s a veteran wing in a rookie’s body
Probably JV - dude's a walking double-double on the Grizzlies and nobody talks about him.  The entire Grizz roster is underrated too; love me some Desmond Bane.
That was pick 25. Who judges picks at that range so harshly?   The only players I see that were available at that point who were hyped by media is Tyrell Terry and Desmond Bane and I wouldn't fault teams for passing on them.
Dillon Brooks and Desmond Bane were the only two that showed up tonight. Lol
I’m jealous af of Desmond Bane. Exact kind of shooter/player any team would love to have and he is jacked af
"I will say anything, Desmond Bane is a stud dude. He was by far the Grizzlies most composed player down the stretch of the game and my Gf &amp; I kept yelling at the Knicks to guard him."
"What kind of meltdown was that at the end? Did one foul call really trigger a 5x tech combo?    Feel bad for Desmond Bane, dude was unstoppable out there. So much energy for someone that looks small compared to the guys in the NBA."
&gt;Saddiq. Sharpshooters can go a long way in this league  What is desmond bane to you? Lol
"I agree completely. There's so much randomness that can go on in a 2 game span, that it discredits the 72(!!) games that came before it. This is why we have best-of-7 series, not single eliminations.   All it takes is a single loss against the Warriors (can definitely happen on any night if you're facing Curry and Green), and then Desmond Bane going 8 for 12 from three in the next game for your whole 72-game season to be wasted."
Ainge really gave away Thybulle and Desmond Bane for peanuts huh
"Why is Desmond Bane not in the list? 3.9 threes per game, at 44.5 percent, solid defender"
Desmond Bane should be here as well
we did draft desmond bane and matisse thybulle it’s just that we fucking traded them for scraps
"Go back in time and draft Brandon Clarke, Desmond Bane and Matisse Thybulle"
"Rest of the list:  6. Isaiah Stewart, Detroit Pistons  7. Immanuel Quickley, New York Knicks  8. Desmond Bane, Memphis Grizzlies  9. Isaac Okoro, Cleveland Cavaliers  10. Cole Anthony, Orlando Magic  Unrankable because it wouldn’t be fair: Paul Reed, Philadelphia 76ers"
"Melton is approaching that Marcus Smart/PatBev defensive tier. If he was on a contender, we'd be hearing so much about him. And shoutout to Desmond Bane, who's been getting more love lately but is still underrated."
Gary Payton II and Desmond Bane
Desmond Bane is the correct answer
"Desmond Bane got a flamethrower, huh?"
"Yeah this is a big nephew take. He’s better at literally everything except for shooting. Their play making is absolutely not on par and it’s not even really that close.   I’m convinced that you probably don’t watch the Grizz play that often but Ja’s vision and playmaking is actually unreal for a young guard. The only reason he’s not averaging more assists is because JJJ has missed the whole season, and the Grizzlies outside shooting is completely fucked without him.   They basically only have Grayson Allen and Desmond Bane as reliable volume 3pt shooters."
"It’s not like he’s been crazy impactful since coming back and like you said they are made of role players, but they probably have some of the most elite role players. Brandon Clarke, Tyus Jones, DeAnthony Melton, Desmond Bane, Kyle Anderson, Grayson Allen, Dillon Brooks. Have all been doing their thang this season."
Desmond Bane.
"True but the question was about a young CORE. Not who had the best young player. Our 1st round pick this year, Desmond Bane, is on pace to break the rookie 3pt% record. He's at 45.9% right now. Brandon Clarke was the summer league MVP last year, Tillman out of Michigan St was a 2nd round steal this year. Grayson Allen has been a 40+% shooter, Ja Morant was Rookie of the Year, and that's all without Jaren Jackson Jr. The whole CORE"
Desmond Bane :(
The Grizzlies are very deep. A big part factor in their success has been the high quality bench minutes they’ve had from guys like Tyus Jones and Desmond Bane.
"* They need a reliable wing. Dillion Brooks is good on offense and defense, but seemingly never at the same time. Desmond Bane looks very promising but is still a rookie and is a bit older.  * One of Ja or JJJ needs to take that next big step and become a superstar. Off the top of my head, Ja needs to work on his shot, JJJ needs to work on being aggressive without being foul-prone.   If one of them can become a superstar and they fill that big positional hole, then they have a deep and talented roster, a good coach, and a good FO. That can push them to contender status, if not title favorites."
"I think Desmond Bane could be a good player, maybe like an Eric Gordon or Danny Green type of player"
"Sure Desmond Bane is Desmond Bane, but this low lottery pick could be anything. It could even be Desmond Bane!"
"Not for nothing, but this was an amazing game for Desmond Bane. 16 points on his customary 60% shooting but he seems more confident on offense and defense. Faster."
22.Ayton Desmond bane Jimmy Butler Richaun Holmes Caris LeVert Khris Middleton Larry Nance Otto Porter Cam Reddish Matisse Thybulle Andrew Wiggins not many stars but good ass players
"Not released, but we traded Desmond Bane to the Grizzlies for basically nothing instead of releasing, like, Tremont Waters or whoever."
Desmond Bane
"The problem I have here is you're looking at each move individually, panning them for being 'bad', and ignoring the result of those decisions.    &gt; he gave up TJ Warren for nothing  He gave up TJ Warren for cap space and used that to pick up Ricky Rubio.  Rubio was a massive upgrade over our past PG rotation and it wouldn't have happened without the TJ Warren trade.  Ricky Rubio was very good for the Suns.  &gt; The Cam pick is so overrated. He reached for no reason to get an off the bench rotation player. Cam would have been available in the 20s or later.  Cam Johnson plays off the bench, sure.  For one of the top teams in the league, in the playoffs, against top tier opponents.  Also, that trade back from 6 brought in Dario Saric, who, apart from the few weeks after he had Covid, has been one of our most important, and impactful, bench players.    &gt; And he traded a FRP (ended up being Desmond Bane) for 1 year of an aging Aron Baynes.  Aron Baynes played great basketball under heavy minutes in replacement for a suspended DeAndre Ayton.  We literally do not make the play in tournament without him.  You're also leaving out a few key pieces of this whole thing.  The first being the trade for Kelly Oubre.  Kelly Oubre immediately improved our locker room culture.  The entire ""Valley Boys"" brand and mentality stems from Kelly Oubre.  Secondly, he brought in Cameron Payne from the Chinese league just before the bubble.  Cameron Payne has been our best bench player in a group of guys that all contribute when they get minutes.  Finally, Monty Williams, enough said.  &gt; one trade that he lucked into imo bc CP3 wanted to play with the core that Jones had no part in drafting, and Crowder signed bc of CP3.  You think CP3 wanted to come to Phoenix without this team going 8-0 in the bubble and without Monty Williams as our coach?  He doesn't.  Give credit where credit is due, CP3 wanted to be here as a direct result of the improved culture, coaching, and play.  All of which were the effects of James Jone's actions.  If the moves James Jones made notably improved the quality of our team, they were not bad moves."
"Lol I'm not saying McD was a good GM. I just think a lot of people are giving Jones credit for a team that was constructed by a core he did not draft in Booker/Ayton/Bridges, one trade that he lucked into imo bc CP3 wanted to play with the core that Jones had no part in drafting, and Crowder signed bc of CP3. Imo the Suns are great bc of those 5 guys and I don't think Jones really had much to do with any of it. He just happened to be the GM of a team that had already had a good young core that one of the best PGs of all time wanted to play with.   On top of that, he's been awful drafting. The Cam pick is so overrated. He reached for no reason to get an off the bench rotation player. Cam would have been available in the 20s or later. And the Smith pick was just plain terrible, especially considering Haliburton was available.   On top of that, he gave up TJ Warren for nothing. And he traded a FRP (ended up being Desmond Bane) for 1 year of an aging Aron Baynes.   When you put all that together, that's how I come to the conclusion that he is the most overrated executive in the league rn."
Desmond Bane
"Desmond Bane. Started the year as a pure spot up shooter with below average handles. Towards the end of the season started showing a knack for dribble drive &amp; finish. He needs to become a better passer and learn how to get his shot off the dribble, especially from 3. There was too many games where he was able to be game planned out because the only 3's he would take are kick out, wide open 3's."
Desmond Bane. He’s a solid wing player who shoots with incredible efficiency as a rookie off the Memphis bench.
"&gt; Not trading the highly valued Kings and Grizzlies picks for anything &gt; Not trading Morris and Rozier at the 2019 trade deadline and letting them walk for nothing  What trades should he have made? Especially with those picks? And bear in mind we would have to use Horford/Hayward/Irving as matching salary if we're trading for some star on a big contract. Possibly Smart + a bunch of other players for someone with a smaller salary but those trades are tough during the season.  And there's a lot of hindsight bias. Those Kings and Grizzlies picks ended up in the middle of first round but they could have been much better. The Kings had their best season in ~15 years. If things went a little worse for them that pick could have been Zion or Morant.  &gt; Letting Kyrie, Horford, and Hayward walk for virtually nothing  As opposed to trading them mid-season? Though if the rumors of the Hayward-Turner trade are true then yeah, Ainge should have done that deal.  &gt; Signing Kemba Walker, an aging undersized inefficient PG, to a max contract  Again, what else are we doing if we don't sign Kemba? And we had to use that cap space. The following year Brown's big extension was kicking in.  &gt;Using the MLE on Tristan Thompson  &gt;Trading away the pick that became Desmond Bane for 2 2nd rounders   Yep, those are not great.  &gt; Coming away with only Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, and Carsen Edwards in 2019 while simultaneously trading away Matisse Thybulle.  True but drafting in the middle of first round is a crap shoot. And Ainge's overall draft performance is amazing."
"Copy/pasting this from /u/_irongiant_'s comment in the Celtics sub, just to provide context to the negative things he's done over the past two years.  &gt; In my eyes this is a much needed move. Ainge had a great stretch as a GM until 2019 but since then it's just been blunder after blunder.  &gt; Coming away with Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, and Carsen Edwards in 2019 while simultaneously trading away Matisse Thybulle.  &gt; Not trading Morris and Rozier at the 2019 trade deadline and letting them walk for nothing  &gt; Not trading the highly valued Grizzlies pick for anything  &gt; Trading away the pick that became Desmond Bane for 2 2nd rounders  &gt; Letting Kyrie, Horford, and Hayward walk for virtually nothing  &gt; Signing Kemba Walker, an aging undersized inefficient PG, to a max contract  &gt; Using the MLE on Tristan Thompson  &gt; So many blunders in the span of 2 years has left this team asset-less and in a bad spot. 99% of GMs would have been fired over these moves/non-moves, so Ainge would be doing us a favor by stepping down.  Granted, I don't agree with the ""we drafted this guy instead of this better player"" logic just because that's all hindsight, but all the other reasons are valid."
"You can pretty easily argue all of those points.  &gt; Coming away with only Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, and Carsen Edwards in 2019 while simultaneously trading away Matisse Thybulle.  It should be pretty obvious after last night that Romeo Langford is going to be a good player in this league.  Edwards was a 2nd rounder and Williams was pick #22 which usually amounts to not much in this league.  As for Thybulle - what would the Celtics have even done with him?  He's utterly useless on offense and they already have Marcus Smart- any Smart/Thybulle lineup would be a disaster.  &gt; Not trading Morris and Rozier at the 2019 trade deadline and letting them walk for nothing  This doesn't even make much sense.  Nobody was giving up a fortune for free agents to be and the Celtics are precisely the kind of team that would generally be looking to acquire these guys.  &gt; Not trading the highly valued Kings and Grizzlies picks for anything &gt; Trading away the pick that became Desmond Bane for 2 2nd rounders  These aren't bad decisions so much as coin flip calls.  &gt; Letting Kyrie, Horford, and Hayward walk for virtually nothing  No choice on Kyrie, Horford got overpaid and that's not Ainge's fault, and they got the massive TPE for Hayward.  &gt; Signing Kemba Walker, an aging undersized inefficient PG, to a max contract  This is again a hindsight issue due to his knee going south.  At the time the signing was 100% justifiable and universally applauded.  &gt; Using the MLE on Tristan Thompson  Really don't see the issue here.  He's a great postseason player and gave them a dimension they needed.  You're really not going to do much better than TT on an MLE."
That's such a fucking dumb homer take lmao.  You all traded Thybulle for #24 and #33. #33 was Carsen Edwards which was a complete waste of a high second (don't draft &lt;6' shooting guards that high in the draft cmon people).   24 was offloaded to Phoenix in a salary dump and Phoenix sent over a 2020 future first which ended up being Desmond Bane. Quick reminder - Boston traded that pick for future seconds and Bane is riding his way into an All-Rookie selection.
"THANK YOU.  I mean look all of your comments come with the benefit of hindsight but at the end of the day he sat on his hands with his warchest of assets and don't have anything to show for it.   Also not to shit on Kemba but once has to wonder if they took that max money and signed some cheaper, more complimentary pieces. Ricky Rubio went for 17M/year for example. You could've gotten him, a good sixth man and another complimentary guy for the price you paid Kemba. That would've also let to having more trade-able assets down the line because the Jays and Marcus Smart are more or less untouchable.  But if you were going to sign Kemba Walker and put yourself into a position where you can't effectively salary match (which doesn't go well with the fact that they had a warchest of draft picks and untouchable players) then the least you could've done over the past few years is draft older, more complimentary guys that were ready to contribute immediately next to your core.  Brandon Clarke, Matisse Thybulle, Desmond Bane - all players that Ainge either missed out on or literally traded away. Payton Pritchard was a solid pick, but Ainge should've doubled down on getting that type of player."
"He was great up until 2019 but has been bad since then.   - Coming away with only Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, and Carsen Edwards in 2019 while simultaneously trading away Matisse Thybulle.   - Not trading Morris and Rozier at the 2019 trade deadline and letting them walk for nothing   - Not trading the highly valued Kings and Grizzlies picks for anything   - Trading away the pick that became Desmond Bane for 2 2nd rounders   - Letting Kyrie, Horford, and Hayward walk for virtually nothing   - Signing Kemba Walker, an aging undersized inefficient PG, to a max contract   - Using the MLE on Tristan Thompson     Then there was the whole ""I haven't seen any racism in TD Garden"" thing which may or may not have alienated some of the players.    99% of GMs would have been fired for having the 2 year stretch Ainge did. Him stepping down is doing us a favor."
"Such a steal that you traded him and the 30th pick (Desmond Bane) for two future second round picks, and paid Tristan Thompson about twice as much to take his spot?"
Desmond Bane is a very handsome man. I would touch his biceps
"Any Desmond Bane coming up in next draft, we need one"
Reminder that Desmond Bane is so much better than Dok Azubuike
has desmond bane been mentioned yet?
Desmond Bane my 2K ringer. Sniper mode
Why do Desmond Bane and Grayson Allen look like the bullies in a afterschool special
Might as well trade for Desmond Bane
"That’s funny. You listed the Grizzlies twice.  Since 2014 they have drafted from picks 14 and on;  Dillon Brooks, Brandon Clarke, Desmond Bane which is a better haul than Rozier, Williams, and Pritchard.   Not to mention they did it with way less picks."
I wanted the Bucks to draft Desmond Bane so bad
Desmond Bane has more to gain from winning a title than KD tbh
"Desmond Bane, wanted the Bucks to draft him"
"Wrong on:  * Anthony Edwards. I thought he was a really good prospect, but the shot making he showed in the second half of the season was really impressive and ahead of schedule IMO. * Sekou Doumbouya. He's still a very young prospect, but after two years he hasn't improved as much as I would have hoped. I thought he had super high potential coming out of the draft but so far he hasn't shown much.  * Grant Williams. I wasn't as high on him as some other draft people were, but I didn't expect to just be flat out terrible.  Right on:  * Jarrett Culver. Great college player but I never understood why he was such a high pick. He's an inefficient jump shooter and he's not athletic/explosive enough to be a great finisher. His offensive strengths (passing/ball handling) aren't very valuable unless his scoring is good enough to be an on-ball threat. By all accounts, he sounds like a great dude and hard worker so I do hope he proves me wrong in year three though. * James Wiseman. He looked really raw which I expected. I still think he has high potential moving forward, but I was not surprised that he was a net negative as a rookie. This one is a major TBD though because he could make huge leaps moving forward. * Desmond Bane. I'm a biased Grizzlies fan, but Bane has been really damn good this season. He's older so his potential is lower than most picks, but I wouldn't be surprised if he's someone who averages like 19/4/4 in his prime."
"Some picks like G Williams and not keeping Desmond Bane suck, and not making moves for vets suck as well. But Pritchard at 26, Timelord at 27, not buying Bender hype and picking Brown, TURNING A 1 PICK (FULTZ) into a lotto pick and Tatum."
"There's a ton of untapped potential in Africa, I mean look this past years draft had 8 players of Nigerian descent:  Onyeka Okongwu (Hawks) Isaac Okoro (Cavaliers ) Precious Achiuwa (Heat) Zeke Nnaji (Nuggets) Desmond Bane (Celtics) Udoka Azubuike (Jazz) Jordan Nwora (Bucks) Daniel Oturu (Timberwolves)  And that's just players of Nigerian descent, African is a big ass continent with a shitload of different people. Wise investment here for the NBA. It also makes me wonder whether they'll be investing in India as well, another place with a huge population and the potential to produce NBA players and grow the NBA's international audience"
Desmond Bane almost looks like 2015 Steph appearance wise
"Grayson Allen, Ja Morant and Desmond Bane . Sounds like a team of villains from a superhero movie"
"Desmond Bane before shooting a 3: ""The bomb is armed. The bomb is mobile. The identity of the triggerman is a mystery."""
Desmond Bane was getting wonderful reviews before the draft. A lot of mock drafts had him as high as like 20th. Memphis somehow got him at 30. Insane
"Whatchu gonna do when Dillon Brooks, Desmond Bane, and Grayson Allen come after you, brother!!!"
"who's more jacked, batman bane or desmond bane?"
"DESMOND ""ICE IN MY VEINS"" BANE"
Grizz are so fun wtf. Desmond Bane is fucking JACKED
Desmond Bane is so awesome
Desmond Bane is so good. Can't believe he wasn't picked earlier in the draft.
MOTHER FUCKING DESMOND BANE
"You merely adopted the three pointer. Desmond Bane was born in it, molded by it."
Desmond Bane sounds like the name of some absolute unit of a center
Desmond Bane honestly the steal of the draft
I really like Desmond Bane
Desmond Bane was like a throwaway draft night trade from the Celtics right?
Desmond Bane is who Xavier Henry was supposed to be.
"But it was an unnatural shooting motion. There are two key differences between Poole's shot last night and the two landing space fouls you have linked:  1. In both of the landing space fouls the defenders close out directly towards the shooter. Desmond Bane closed out to the side of Jordan Poole and would not have touched him given a natural shooting motion. 2. Poole flairs his right leg out to the side to make contact, this is more akin to Draymond sticking his leg forward in the unnatural shooting motion video than either of the landing space foul videos.  You can look through a video of [Poole shooting 3s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9bAM6o2yYU) and see pretty quickly that what happened last night isn't his natural shooting motion. If the L2M report comes out today and says different then I'll take it back, but to me that was pretty clearly Poole being opportunistic and sticking out his leg."
Desmond Bane and Tillman with 30th and 35th picks. Easy money.
"This excuse is so lame. Its not like Grayson Allen, Dillon Brooks, Xavier Tillman, and Desmond Bane are much more respected than guys like Poole, Bazemore, and Wiggins"
"Desmond Bane went to TCU and we could have drafted him, instead we drafted Josh Green who has barely played. Bunch of Mavs fans wanted to take Bane. Nothing to do with playoffs but just that he could be doing that with us"
Desmond “Brickhouse” Bane
"1. Western Conference playin teams would destroy most of the Eastern Conference playoff teams. Need 1-16 seeding 2. Warriors really had their seasoned ended by Desmond ""T-Rex arms negative wingspan"" Bane 3. \#FreeCurry, come join your boy #KidFromAkron"
"another almost mav, Desmond Bane (picked one before). also another almost mav, Ja Morant ( fuckin pingpong ball). gg grizz, good luck!"
DESMOND BANE
That Desmond Bane dunk hit omg
MY BOY DESMOND BANE!
Desmond Bane looks like Walmart Wes from HTGAWM
Reminder that the Celtics gave up the rights to Desmond Bane for two future second rounders
Desmond bane looks like the guys in high school who join the basketball team midseason after football ends
Desmond Bane - 30
cant be scoring champ if his FG rate that assisted is like Desmond Bane and Wayne Ellington
I got 9 between Desmond Bane and Lou Spicer
"Yeah just got 9 with Desmond Bane. Seems like unles there is a better start than Parsley, 10 is impossible"
9 - Art Hillhouse -&gt; Desmond Bane
9 between Desmond Bane and Art Hillhouse  1 between Tim Hardaway and Tim Hardaway Jr. (through Metta World Peace)
Best I could do is 9 with Fred Sheffield to Desmond Bane
I got 9 degrees between Desmond bane and Lonnie eggleston
Impressive that Desmond Bane is out there.
Is it just me or is Desmond Bane thicc
Is it just me or is Desmond Bane sorta huge in height and muscle?
OK I didn't know desmond bane was this athletic mother fucker looks like a bullet train running down there
"Desmond Bane and Vassell way too low, Pokusevski WAY too high.  Dude is a meme so he gets hyped but he was statistically and by the eye test one of the worst players in the league"
Desmond Bane should be 2nd team
Louisville fan here - no idea how he fell so hard. I get that he's an older rookie but the dude is a bucket and has the height to play small forward.   People need to stop letting older rookies drop and then being surprised when they can immediately contribute. Desmond Bane is riding his way into an All-Rookie team for fuck's sake.

Desmond Bane has been really good for us too. Should probably start for us in some circumstances.
Desmond Bane is better.
Dude's definitely old but the amount of shit that older rookies get is ridiculous.  Memphis' entire drafting strategy in the late first round has been taking older guys that are ready to contribute and then people get surprised when players like Desmond Bane and Brandon Clarke are making All-Rookie teams.  Hell if I'm picking late in the first round I may as well just go for a high-floor guy since you're getting into a crapshoot that late in the draft.
Dude's definitely old but the amount of shit that older rookies get is ridiculous.  Memphis' entire drafting strategy in the late first round has been taking older guys that are ready to contribute and then people get surprised when players like Desmond Bane and Brandon Clarke are making All-Rookie teams.   Duarte's older than Bane obviously but he'll slide into whatever team he gets drafted on immediately.
"Dillon Brooks and Desmond Bane are both pretty underrated, but they started getting some more attention toward the end of the year."
"Let's go, dude is a great player. This year's Desmond Bane (but with more exposure)"
"Khris ""Two-face"" Middleton  Nikola ""Joker"" Jokic  Desmond Bane  Terrence Ross-al-Ghul  Klay ""Klayface"" Thompson  Could the Batman villain starting 5 make the playoffs in the East?"
"They don't need people from other countries, if Team Nigeria had all the people with Nigerian heritage they'd already be insane.   Giannis, Bam, Anunoby, Ayton, Desmond Bane, Zeke Nnaji, Iguodala, Okafor, Oladipo, Okongwu, Okoro.  There's a ton of Nigerian NBA talent."
"The 2020 NBA Draft had Onyeka Okongwu, Isaac Okoro, Precious Achiuwa, Udoka Azubuike, Zeke Nnaji, Daniel Oturu, Jordan Nwora and Desmond Bane who were either from Nigeria themselves or had a parent from Nigeria.  So not only is the top end talent promising, but they would be able to field a deep team"
Festus ezeli is on that team.. there is zero chance he doesnt get picked while desmond bane gets picked.. dude.. ezeli is a real nigerian. He'll be given preference over the implants
Desmond Bane
22- Jonás Valanciunas  23-Ja Morant  24- Jaren Jackson Jr.   25- Dillon Brooks  26- Xavier Tillman  27- Desmond Bane  28- Tyus Jones  29- Kyle Anderson  30- DeAnthony Melton    And Dillon Brooks is the first ever 8x DPOY
i get the bane part but desmond is not a sith name lol
Surely Desmond Bane is related to Cad Bane
Yeah Desmond Bane
"Desmond Bane will start on good playoff teams for years, Saddiq Bey as well. I have confidence Maxey can be borderline all star level one day, but it will depend on his development as a shooter and passer. kid’s got that “it” factor and competes on defense too   Theo Maledon is one to watch also"
Saddiq Bey or Desmond Bane will have the longest careers
"I don’t know if he’ll have the best career, but Desmond Bane will be at least a steady guy that plays 15-20 years in the NBA for no less than 5 teams"
"&gt; Snyder joined most of the Jazz’s front office in being frustrated by the selection of Udoka Azubuike with the team’s first-round pick in 2020.   Anyone know who the Jazz wanted instead? The players picked after him were Jaden McDaniels, Malachi Flynn, &amp; Desmond Bane. Xavier Tillman in the 2nd round would have been nice next to Gobert or as a small-ball center, as well."
"Gib Desmond Bane and other stuff idk, you're right his value is hard to tell"
Damn I wanted to trade the Cs 14th pick with the Suns so we could get Halliburton. Jalen Smith for sure would have been available at 14 and the Cs would have thrown in another pick (30th- Desmond Bane) to get it done.   I really wanted Halliburton…
"The front office made a mistake by drafting and staking a third big instead of picking someone like Desmond Bane. This Jazz team is really good, their path to a championship isn't far but they need to improve in the fringes and address their weaknesses instead of ignoring them."
"Also - Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris, Desmond Bane, and Trey Lyles. Carsen Edwards isn't from Indiana."
"Every draft pick is hit or miss, last year Saddiq Bey, Desmond Bane, Tyrese Haliburton, and Payton Prichard these are the types I am talking about. Chris Duarte, Trey Murphy III, Corey Kispert, James Bouknight, and Davion Mitchell. These are more seasoned then your typical one and dones."
"&gt;1. New York Knicks  &gt;majority opinion - Patty Mills and Terrance Ross  &gt;honorable mentions - TJ McConnell, Dunleavy jr, Michael Jordan, Reggie Miller, Jeff Green, Elfrid Payton, Andre Drummond, Trae Young, Sabonis, Tony Snell, Mo Williams, Thad Young, Bradley Beal, Travis Outlaw Jarret Jack, DJ Augustine, Omri Casspi,Kyle Lowry , Kelly Olynyk, Desmond Bane  WTF who said Patty Mills and Terrance Ross if you gave me 100 guesses I would've never gotten that.   1. Trae Young(overreaction to the playoffs)  Honorable mention: Michael Jordan, kept the Knicks best 90s squads from even making the championships, Reggie Miller, the choke, Hakeem, destroyed the Knicks in the Finals first appearance since '72-'73, David Robinson and Tim Duncan, I still have nightmares of Sprewell getting trapped under the basket in the Finals, Lebron James the unbeatable force in Miami. James Dolan because we don't need a reason to hate him."
"Meanwhile, Desmond Bane out here shooting 43% on 4 3s a game looking like he's never seen an object he couldn't curl."
"There's been at least one sniper taking between 20-30 every year in the draft for a long time now, pretty remarkable:  **2020:** Desmond Bane (30)  **2019:** Jordan Poole (28 - arguable)  **2018:** Grayson Allen (21), Landry Shamet (26)  **2017:** OG Anunoby (23)  **2016:** Furkan Korkmaz (26)  **2015:** Bobby Portis (22)  **2014:** Bogdan Bogdanovic (27)  **2013:** Tim Hardaway Jr (24), Reggie Bullock (25)  **2012:** Evan Fournier (20)  **2011:** Nikola Mirotic (23)  **2010:** Off year - maybe Greivis Vasquez (28)?  **2009:** Darren Collison (21), Omri Casspi (23), Wayne Ellington (28).  **2008:** Ryan Anderson (21)  **2007:** Jared Dudley (22), Aaron Brooks (26), Arron Afflalo (27)."
"2016: Siakam  2017: OG (not really any better picks after him)  2018: had no picks that year, so I'll use Spur's pick, which they got in the Kawhi trade. It would probably be Gary Trent Jr  2019: Dewan Hernandez??? (59th pick lol)  2020: Malachi Flynn or Desmond Bane, no player late in this draft showed that much promise as of yet."
He'd have to change numbers. His 22 is taken by our rookie standout Desmond Bane.
"Ain't no way Isaac Okoro, Desmond Bane, Immanuel Quickley are better than Cole Anthony."
"You merely adopted the dark; Desmond Bane was born in it, molded by it!"
Really dont understand Desmond Bane over Cole Anthony
Did you see Desmond Bane? Too good for summer league.
"Off of the dome:  Draymond at the 5, player who averages less that 11 per game. I don’t need to explain how much Draymond impacts a basketball game. But ill give the short version. Elite game changing defender, and elite playmaker on offense  Desmond Bane at the 3, player who has never been a consistent starter. Elite shooter, solid defender. Smart player who is very often in the right spot on both sides of the ball. Absolute steamer of a shooter.  Ja Morant at the 1, not an all star in the last 4 years (or yet so far in general). Elite playmaking point guard who can run the offense.  Zach Lavine at the 2, never been to a game 7. This was also a best player available situation at this point. Lavine someone else who can spread the floor at an elite level and take some scoring load off of Ingram and Ja. and is a solid wing and guard defender."
Desmond Bane snubbed hard
3 games w/ 20.3 ppg on 51/53/93 splits lol he was making one of the teams.    Only played a part of the 3rd game which hurt his PPG average and yet he was top 10 w/ the best shooting splits among top scorers other than perhaps Desmond Bane (who actually played 2 games only).
"Nice, here's a table with the top three category leaders.  |**Player**|**PPG**| |:--|--:| |Cam Thomas|27.0| |Tyrese Maxey|26.0| |Desmond Bane|24.0|  |**Player**|**REB**| |:--|--:| |Jalen Smith|12.5| |Paul Reed|12.0| |John Konchar|12.0|  |**Player**|**AST**| |:--|--:| |Payton Pritchard|8.5| |Immanuel Quickley|7.8| |Sharife Cooper|7.3|  |**Player**|**BLK**| |:--|--:| |Daniel Oturu|3.3| |Alperen Sengun|3.0| |Sekou Doumbouya|3.0|  |**Player**|**STL**| |:--|--:| |Tremont Waters|3.5| |Jordan Goodwin|3.3| |Louis King|3.2|"
"1-3 - No 1 option on a winning team  4-10- Sporadic all star / high level 3rd option  10-14 - solid starter 15-60- You take what you get imo..gambles like poku doesn't matter much if they dont pan out but drafting older players like perhaps kispert this year, derrick white,brogdon desmond bane expectations will be of atleast a competent rotational piece with ceiling of an borderline allstar perhaps."
OKC/WSH was a pick they got in the Kemba trade; OKC chose to send the lower of the two.  DAL/MIA was a pick acquired from Memphis in exchange for Desmond Bane and Enes Kanter. The Grizzlies got the higher of these two the Mavs and sent it to Boston.  These are the two 2023 2nds Boston has and they just gave the lower of those to the Knicks.
"By my tally you all have traded *four* second rounders this year.  I believe for the initial Fournier trade Boston traded their 2025 and 2027 own picks. The picks that were used to create this TPE haven't been revealed yet, but I believe Ainge traded the 2020 #30 (Desmond Bane) for multiple seconds and I imagine those could have been used.  That being said, you all have a ton of second rounders in 2023 that can still be used. If you're able to get Thad Young for a couple of seconds then yeah damn that's a solid steal."
1. MIN - LaMelo Ball  2. GSW - Tyrese Haliburton  3. CHA - Anthony Edwards  4. CHI - Patrick Williams  5. CLE - Saddiq Bey  6. ATL - Onyeka Okongwu  7. DET - Immanuel Quickley  8. NYK - Desmond Bane  9. WAS - Isaiah Stewart  10. PHX - Devin Vassell  11. SAS - Deni Avdija  12. SAC - Isaac Okoro  13. NOP - Jalen Smith  14. BOS - Xavier Tillman
IMO:  1. LaMelo Ball 2. Anthony Edwards  3. Tyrese Halliburton  4. Patrick Williams  5. James Wiseman 6. Isiah Stewart 7. Isaac Okoro 8. Saddiq Bey 9. Onyeka Okungwu (injury concern made me put him lower than I’d like). 10. Cole Anthony 11. Desmond Bane 12. Tyrese Maxsey 13. Kira Lewis Jr. 14. Killian Hayes
"Both IQ and Desmond bane were on playoff teams “trying to win games”. They were also getting mins in the playoffs so that’s not a good argument.  At the end of the day, he didn’t play 20+ mins a night and didn’t make a rookie team. Maybe he works out in the future but that’s not a reason to justify putting him above other rookies who had better years in a re draft."
Ainge spiralled after the 2019 disaster season that was supposed to be his magnum opus. Just a string of bad move after bad move like giving Kanter 2 years 10 million and then immediately dumping him with a first rounder a year later which turned out to be Desmond Bane and then there's using 17 million of the Hayward exception on Fournier who was expiring even though he himself repeatedly said that using the exception on an expiring player is probably a bad idea. Danny lost his marbles at the end of his tenure although he did draft Pritchard and Nesmith so that's nice
Desmond Bane top 10
"If Jaren Jackson and Desmond Bane are your #3/#4 on offense you definitely need help if you wanna compete.  They are not bad played, but they can't carry an offense."
Desmond Bane.  Maybe not superstar level but at least the All-Star level I think is doable.
Desmond Bane!
Desmond Bane
"Saddiq bey,  Desmond Bane"
"I know this may seem obvious, but the 2nd year players have looked pretty exceptional this summer league. Quickley and Obi, Desmond Bane, Maxey, Nesmith and Pritchard have all looked like the best players on the court in their games."
"Desmond Bane, Xavier Tillman?"
"You mean Desmond Bane, right? Bey was taken at 19."
&gt; Desmond Bane  he's a big guy
What's the antonym of mellifluous? Cuz Sindarius Thornwell is up there with Desmond Bane as a name a movie villain would have
"Boston gave him away to get rid of Kemba.  They gave away Desmond Bane last year to get rid of Kenter.  I think they also gave up Tybulle to get rid of Baynes.  What a mess especially when they retained guys like Carson Edwards, Grant Williams, and Langford"
"The Desmond Bane thing was so frustrating because I was campaigning hard for the C's to draft him but they literally had no more roster spots and more or less gave the pick away for free...it was such a tease when the draft coverage showed the pick next to the Celtics logo, only to inform us he was going to play somewhere else instead."
"So basically, you trade Desmond Bane and TT for Bruno, Dunn, and a handful of future 2nds?  That doesn’t actually sound like the worst thing ever.  Silly on paper, but if it works it works 😂"
"I love Desmond Bane, but there are a few rookies that do not need SL, him and guys like Saddiq Bey are guys that already looked NBA ready out the gate and I don't expect them to play the whole SL."
"Still have no fucking idea why Ainge drafted a sub 6' shooting guard with such a high second rounder.   Actually I love telling the story of how they drafted Carsen Edwards because it's such a clusterfuck:  2019 draft night - Boston owns #20 which ends up being Matisse Thybulle. Boston has 3 first rounders that night so they're kind of forced to trade out.  Boston trades #20 for #24 (Ty Jerome) and #33 (Carsen Edwards). #24 ends up getting traded along with Aron Baynes to Phoenix to free up cap space to overpay Kemba Walker. Phoenix has a protected 2020 first from Milwaukee that they give to Boston.  2020 draft night - Boston's first from the previous trade is #30 which ends up being Desmond Bane (all rookie team, mind you). That pick is immediately traded to Memphis for future second rounders.  Those future second rounders are traded for a half a season of Evan Fournier. Boston then traded their 2021 FRP (#16) along with Kemba Walker to OKC for Al Horford and to free up cap space which they were hopefully going to use to re-sign Fournier. Fournier dipped for the bag.  So long story short, Boston squandered those picks (and ended up giving another pick away) for pretty much nothing."
Shoutout to Desmond Bane and Xavier Tillman on the Grizzlies
Desmond Bane better anyway
Nah. We usually trade up back into the 1st with our 2nd round picks on the NBA draft. So expect us to use those 2nd round picks to do the same.  We also didnt want to pay Allen with JJJ up for an extension and Ja not far behind. Also gives us some leeway to decide on Dillon Brooks future. Plus we are super high on Desmond Bane and he likely gets more minutes with Allen gone.
"For those confused about why the Grizzlies would do this, remember the scene in Moneyball when Brad Pitt told the A's coach to start Chris Pratt off the bench, but the coach kept starting this other 1B he thought was better so Brad Pitt traded that guy to another team? That's basically what this is here. Grayson Allen is a solid bench guy and could be great for the Bucks, but for some reason Coach Jenkins loved him so much, that he kept starting him and giving him more minutes over better players like De'Anthony Melton and Desmond Bane. I still think the Grizzlies could have received more for Allen, but I do think this will force them to play better lineups and improve the team in the end."
"JV only has one year left on his contract, Steven has 3 and is more expensive, so he’s a fit for the future?   &gt;definitely not  my bad, Desmond Bane shot 43% compared to 39% for Grayson lol.  Benefit of the doubt doesn’t mean anything, they made bad moves, it’s okay to acknowledge it."
Thx for Desmond Bane   Your username is trash too.   Jayson Tatum might average 20 this szn. Evan Fournier is &gt;
So Boston traded Desmond Bane for literally nothing. I'd be pissed as a Boston fan after last season and this off-season. Exactly what NOT to do with a roster.
"The whole debacle leading up to that pick was stupid.  Iirc, Boston owned pick #24 from Philly in the 2019 draft. Boston packaged that pick and Aron Baynes to Phoenix so they could clear salary for Kemba Walker. Remember that Boston had to package this year's first along with Kemba to get off his salary.  Anyways, that #24 was traded for a future first that ended up being Desmond Bane, but Boston traded that pick too for future seconds.  Fucking waste."
Then why the fuck did Danny give up a first round pick (Desmond Bane) to get rid of enes last year. Danny was a clown I swear
Grizzlies need to cut Desmond bane. I don’t like that guy
Bane. Desmond Bane
"I kinda think they have their team. Just about the young guys like Desmond Bane, Xavier Tillman continuing to get better. Also, hope JJJ can get back to being himself"
"**PG:** Ja Morant, De'Anthony Melton, Tyus Jones.   **SG:** Dillon Brooks, Desmond Bane, Grayson Allen.   **SF:** Kyle Anderson, Ziaire Williams.  **PF:** Jaren Jackson Jr, Brandon Clarke, Santi Aldama.   **C:** Steven Adams, Xavier Tillman.   That's excluding Bledsoe."
Jazz drafted Mitchell at 13 and Gobert at 27  But also drafted Azubuike over Desmond Bane so
"Dealing or using second round picks got Memphis some steals with Brandon Clarke, Desmond Bane, and Xavier Tillman."
"I'm not sure how long you've been a Celtics fan, but there were three different times in recent years where he went into draft night with three 1st round picks and no roster spots for all of them. He'd be like ""what the hell am I supposed to do with Guerschon Yabusele and Ante Zizic?"" That's how he ended up sending Matisse Thybulle to Philly when Boston had the 20th pick two years ago and Desmond Bane to Memphis last year."
real Desmond Bane moment of Memphis trading back into the 1st
I remember a really heartwarming video when Desmond Bane was drafted where it came that we had drafted him at 30 but the TV was saying Celtics and everyone was freaking out and Des was saying how he had loved the idea of playing for Memphis but his grandmother was on the couch sad because she thought he was saying he had wanted Memphis but was going to Boston.  https://youtu.be/BfsGDRRhA1U
No way Memphis does that. Desmond Bane is a beast
I really liked that trade at the time. Green looked old and finished in the playoffs. He had the achilles strain ofc but I think it made sense to try to get younger and acquire the 6MOTY.  Apparently the Lakers were interested in Desmond Bane with their pick though. That would've been sick. He's awesome
I would take 10 and Desmond Bane for 7
I’m not enough of a college/draft guy to really comment on Duarte but considering he’s close to the oldest player in the draft I’d expect a number of teams to have a good look at him. A team like Memphis has benefitted in recent years from drafting older guys like Desmond Bane and Brandon Clarke. Also he shot the three well so naturally there will be some interest.  It will be fascinating nonetheless to see how Pelinka navigates it.
"Warriors hang up the phone  I will literally eat a sock if the Warriors trade down for Desmond Bane, on god"
"That’s the point, a trade *wouldnt* work here. Clearly we’re not getting Brooks, and clearly you’re not moving up for just Kyle Anderson or Desmond Bane. There’s no trade here that makes sense for both sides.. so either the grizzlies overpay to move up to #7, or they find a different trade partner"
"Lmao, imagine trying to sell me on Bane like we’d be lucky to get him for the #7 in this years draft. At the end of the day this trade ain’t happening, dubs make no sense as a trade partner for the grizzlies.. I understand we’re not getting Brooks, but you gotta understand you’re not moving up just for Kyle Anderson or Desmond Bane. There’s no way to come up with a trade that works for both sides here.   Seems like the Grizzlies will either have to overpay if they really wanna move up, or just pick at #10 and be happy with it"
"Desmond Bane was one of the best shooters in the league last season as a rookie, and is an athletic stud and great on defense. You’d be lucky to get him, which you won’t. You’ll probably get Kyle Anderson. At the end of the day, you’re not getting Brooks. Our FO has made it pretty clear he’s a big part of our future. Just because the Wizards said they’re interested in him doesn’t mean we’re interested in trading him. You’ve got to be realistic, and thinking that one of our most important players is worth moving up three spots isn’t anywhere close to realistic. Plus you don’t have the salary to make it work."
"Yep those seem like the real options, idk how grizzlies fans on here thinking Bob is gonna go from looking at Beal and Siakam to all of a sudden trading down for Desmond Bane caliber players lol"
"If it’s “just moving up 3 spots” then why don’t the grizzlies just pick at #10? Can’t play it off like moving up 3 spots is worth nothing, when clearly the grizzlies FO highly values picking 3 spots earlier  Not saying it’s worth Brooks, but you gotta give up something of value that the Warriors want. And please don’t say Desmond Bane lol, sick of hearing that, like the Warriors kept the twolves pick all year in this loaded draft only to trade it for fucking Desmond Bane lmao"
Desmond bane is a good young role player. Solid defender and had one of the highest 3P% in the league last year
"Zeke Nnaji, and PJ obviously  Other teams - Patrick Williams, Malik Monk, Josh Jackson, Saddiq Bey, Desmond Bane"
Desmond Bane.   Solid wing in a limited role as a rookie. Curious to see if he can get more minutes.
"He's a mid first, late lottery type prospect. I don't think there's any chance he falls to the second round. He reminds me of Desmond Bane with more ball handling."
Trae Young / LaMelo Ball / Tyrese Haliburton  Luka Doncic / Lu Dort / Desmond Bane  Michael Porter Jr / DeAndre Hunter / Duncan Robinson  Jaren Jackson Jr / John Collins / PJ Tucker  DeAndre Ayton / Xavier Tillman / Isaiah Stewart
"Dude our drafts under Zach Kleiman have been insane. Like getting Ja is pretty easy, second pick take best player available. But he also found Brandon Clarke who was the steal of that draft, and last year found Desmond Bane and Xavier Tillman at 30 and 35.   The only players who shot better from deep as rookies than Bane in the last ten years were Steph Curry and Jayson Tatum. I think in a few seasons people are going to be scratching their heads why Bane went so late.  Tillman was also a good find, I think he's a solid backup big who will stick around in the league a long time.  Grizz fans aren't overlooking that we didn't just trade up the first round pick. 10 and 40 instead of 17 and 51, Kleiman just might find two more solid pieces."
"Season ticketholder of 30 years, Dubs are a big part of my life and my work. Obviously wouldn't do that deal if Beal becomes a real option, and if Beal isn't an option I'd ask for Desmond Bane in the above deal but that wouldn't happen.   I love Wiggs but the reality is (and has been) that he's more valuable to the Dubs than he is to anyone else. There's a reason he's only considered a ""salary match"" in suggested trades - he's a positive asset for the Warriors but a net neutral or negative for most other teams bc of his salary.   My original post was an immediate spitball reaction that admittedly would need some fine tuning, but the general goal remains: Steven Adams. He's undervalued atm and also a perfect fit for the Warriors (which has also been the case for years). This is the first real opportunity to get him.   Also 7-10 in this year's draft is pretty negligible in available players, unless Kaminga or Bouknight drops, both of which are projects that are better suited for rebuilding teams than the contender-hopeful Dubs.   It's not a final trade proposal but it's a decent staring point for a deal."
It’d be tough to pull off.  Id be fine sending Thompson for him but he doesn’t make enough money.  Smart would probably have to be in the deal but that’s obviously too much to give up for Bledsoe.  Realistically it would have to be something like Smart and Thompson for Bledsoe and Desmond Bane and/or Brandon Clarke.
"Not surprised, a backcourt of Ja, Bledsoe, brooks would really need Grayson Allen/Desmond bane to have any type of spacing"
Desmond Bane will be the new Brandon Clarke Ill spend the offseason hyping him up and he'll be out of the rotation by the end of next yr lol
"That’s not bad, grizzlies got Desmond bane with the 30th pick"
"Moving JJJ to centre, maybe?  **PG:** Ja Morant, Eric Bledsoe, De'Anthony Melton, Tyus Jones.   **SG:** Dillon Brooks, Grayson Allen.   **SF:** Kyle Anderson, Desmond Bane.   **PF:** Jaren Jackson Jr, Brandon Clarke.   **C:** Steven Adams, Xavier Tillman.   Looking at that:  1. I'm not sure they're finished, and maybe they're going to package some young players, picks and a contract to get one more starter?  2. If they keep the 10th pick and intend to move JJJ to centre, maybe they take Jalen Johnson and try to make him their PF?"
"Just to add:  Isaac Okoro - Cavs,  Chinezie Metu- Sac,  Chuma Okeke - Orl,  Onyeka Okongwu - Atl,  Zeke Nnaji - Denver,  Udoka Azubuike - Jazz,  Desmond Bane - Mem,  Jordan Nwora - Bucks,  Daniel Oturu - Clips  Monte Morris - Den"
Team USA just added Desmond Bane.
Probably Desmond Bane
"We have 4 picks after having 4 picks last year. We need to consolidate either through stashing or trading up or for future picks. With the 1st pick my guess is we try to trade up so we have more NBA-ready talent which you can find in the late 1st, like Desmond Bane."
"Not necessarily as good, but Memphis definitely have a promising young core:   Ja Morant (21)  Desmond Bane (23)  Jaren Jackson Jr (21)  Brandon Clarke (24)  Xavier Tillman (22)"
"I feel like teams are getting WAY smarter. The top-20 is usually now littered with guys who you are pretty sure are going to have an impact (aside from stupid talented 18 year old freaks like Mo Bamba).  Examples of this - Huerter's jump in 2018 (long and elite shooter), Cam Johnson, Desmond Bane jumping to the 1st round, Herro's jump, Clarke's jump, etc. I feel like teams are really emphasizing skill and NBA-readiness more than ever before.  Guys like Bol Bol, Nassir Little, Darius Bazley, Kevin Knox, KPorter (he panned out), Hamidou Diallo, etc. all saw big drops in their draft stock from where they were projected by general media  I think we see some guys like Corey Kispert, Kessler Edwards, Joe Wieskamp, Trey Murphy, etc. go before super ""talented"" guys like Keon and Kai Jones. I see Kuminga taking a big slide as well."
"That's a fair point, but I just feel with Jaren Jackson coming back that might be enough for y'all to get a pretty cozy 8th seed spot. Also Desmond Bane was getting busy in summer league so I think he's another plus for the Grizzlies along with Dillon Brooks.  I am high on Dame time, however judging from the Trailblazers off season moves...or lack thereof, I don't think they're that high on Dame time anymore. Dame and McCollum will give us what they normally do (until McCollum gets injured again), Norman Powell is good too. I also like that they added a bit more depth at the PF/C position in Larry Nance Jr and Cody Zeller since that seems to be where there injuries always tend to happen. However I feel like the Western Conference teams that are worth a damn made worthwhile moves/improvements while the Trailblazers kinda just put on a band-aid on a boo-boo that's getting infected now.  Spurs I completely forgot about them trading Derozan so yeah lemme get them outta there lmao"
1st team  Cam Payne  Desmond Bane  Cam Johnson  Patrick Williams  Draymond Green  2nd team  Tyrese Maxey  Landry Shamet  Dorian Finney smith  Nic Batum  Nerlens Noel  3rd Team  Ricky Rubio  Danny Green  Robert Covington  Bruce Brown  Robert Williams
"Desmond Bane was shot 47% from the field last season, and 43% from 3. Danny Green was 41% from the field and 40% from 3. I’d keep Bane where he is.  Maybe substitute Maxey for Thybulle or Green though"
"G: Payne G: Maxey F: Patrick Williams F: Desmond Bane C: Daniel Gafford  Tried to account for some defense with Williams and Gafford, probably not a playoff team but could be interesting"
"So I was looking into this a few weeks ago myself, and it turns out there are still two untied threads that started with the trade, at least on the Celtics' side.   In November of 2020, the Celtics were part of a three team trade with the blazers and grizzlies that sent Desmond bane to Memphis and enes Kanter to Portland, giving the Celtics two second round picks, one in 2023 and one in 2025. These are the last two threads. The Cs were only able to make this trade due to getting the rights to draft Desmond Bane in 2019 through a trade that sent Ty Jerome (and Aron Baynes) to the Suns. Ty Jerome (or at least his eventual draft rights, some of the available info is hard to track) was only able to be traded to the Suns due to the Celtics trading away the draft rights to Matisse Thybulle. They only had Thybulle's draft rights due to a trade with the grizzlies that sent Deyonta Davis and Rade Zagorac to Memphis. Zagorac came to the Celtics through the trading away of Brandon Wright, who came to the Celtics from the Mavericks in the Rondo (and Dwight Powell) deal, while Davis came to the Celtics via the trading away of MarShon Brooks and Celtics legend Jordan Crawford. And to finally tie this all up, Brooks was only on the Celtics because of the initial Pierce and KG trade.  The 2023 and 2025 picks are both second rounders, but it will be very interesting to see how the rest of the rippling effect plays out"
Marc Gasol   Mike Conley   Rudy Gay   Ja Morant   JJJ  Dillon Brooks   Desmond Bane   Kyle Anderson   Deanthony Melton   Brandon Clarke   Xavier Tillman   Ziaire Williams
"Mathisse Thybulle, Myles Turner, Kevin Huerter, Desmond Bane in the Iguodala spot."
bro everyone that used our late 1sts hit on them  Thybulle  Desmond Bane  Sengun (TBD but cmon he looks great)
Desmond Bane
Yea google Desmond Bane for me sir
Desmond Bane play for the Grizzlies I believe. Dude look like a lite version of a body builder but shot is as pure as can be.
"In general, stronger players do just not generally have play styles where they are shooting a lot of 3's...but that said, that guy named Lebron has become a solid 3 point shooter.  But if you want other names of guys who are pretty muscular/strong and who have proven to be good shooters: Marcus Morris, Desmond Bane, Julius Randle, Lillard (is actually pretty jacked), Ben Gordon, Meyers Leonard, Arron Afflalo"
"Comparing players outside of Ja and JJJ vs Kat, DLo, and Ant.. this is what we have  Memphis: Dillon Brooks, Steven Adams, Kyle Anderson, Tyus Jones, Desmond Bane, Xavier Tilman, Brandon Clarke, DeAnthony Melton.  Minnesota: Patrick Beverley, Malik Beasley, Tauren Prince, Naz Reid, Jaden McDaniels, Josh Okogie  While I 100% agree that Memphis has more playable guys, we really only have a couple starting-good bench quality players on each. Memphis definitely has more lower bench guys that are still playable, but I focus more on the few that are starter quality players, like: Dillon Brooks, Steven Adams, Kyle Anderson, Patrick Beverley, Malik Beasley.  I think Brandon Clarke and Naz Reid are both close to that level, and everyone else is just decent in a bench role or shouldn't be getting minutes, on both teams..  So the big factor is 3 all star potential players versus 2, though I argue JJJ is by far the biggest stretch to hit that point this season. Also KAT is the best of those 5, then Ja really isn't ahead of DLo and Ant by that much when everyone is healthy. Imo"
"Barrett, Tyler Herro, Sexton.  Desmond Bane will have an exceptional career.  Isaiah Stewart will help lead Detroit back to the playoffs.   Malcolm Brogdon will finish a season top-10 in mvp voting"
"really confident: Domantas Sabonis. i don’t think people realize how close he is to averaging a triple double and he’s only 24. if he can get 1 or 2 threes a game and up his free throws, he’s gonna be like 25/12/8 lmao  somewhat confident: Tyrese Maxey. he loves the big moment and will take and make clutch shots. a crazy amount of different finishes from both hands at the rim. willing and pesky defender. if he can shoot off the bounce, i think it can happen   Shot in the dark: Desmond Bane. a flamethrower and he seems to have made a leap in summer league. needs to get to the line a lot, but i think can be a star"
"Another topic where there are legitimate criticisms to be made, except the ones that get discussed are usually nonsense. Not ""cashing in"" everything to trade for an all-star is kind of a dead-end conversation and hardly worth re-hashing everything again (AD obviously didnt want to be here, Kawhi coming off a big injury, the internet simultaneously thinks Paul George is trash in the playoffs and the Celtics are dumb for not trading for him, list goes on).  The real crime is Ainge blowing some of the peripheral moves that he used to execute so flawlessly. Giving up a pick (Desmond Bane) to get off Kanter is pretty painful, and hurts even more with Stevens bringing Kanter back. Giving up a pick in Kemba/Horford kind of hurts, it could work out overall but giving up a mid-first is a tough thing to sell. The Teague and Thompson signings backfired spectacularly.   The ""embarassment of riches"" from the Nets trade got us Jaylen and Jayson (and technically Romeo and some other stuff) which is really more than we could realistically ask for."
He’s not good enough to be worth potentially hampering the development of Desmond bane. Who can shoot well and is a way better defender.  We also got picks for him
No he’s not.   2019 - slipped on the floor for a grade 2 adductor tear  2021 - Solomon Hill into the ankle  2022 - Desmond Bane into the upper leg   Not much you can do about those
"Cam Reddish, Saddiq Bey. Jordan Poole I'm not that sold yet, hope it was not just preseason fluke. Desmond Bane. Jordan Nwora. Mo Bamba. Tyrese Maxey. Keldon Johnson."
"I don't think advanced stats are proof of anything after 4 or 5 games. What do I expect from the Grizzlies? This a team that kept its core pretty much intact. JJJ is back and healthy, Ja Morant has taken a step forward (will surely become an All Star this season). So have Desmond Bane and Melton. Steven Adams is a worse player than Valanciunas but it might be a better fit. The Grizzlies made the Playoffs last season thru the play in games, so I guess they can fuck around and maybe get a 6th or 7th seed."

[Desmond Bane](https://szatnianba.pl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/desmond-bane-memphis-grizzlies.jpg)
"&gt;  like idk why that's just the image from his name  Pretty sure it's cause that's all anyone can picture with the name ""Desmond Bane"".  Sounds like a bounty hunter from a comic book"
"As a casual fan that watches like a dozen reg season spurs games and kinda follows along the playoffs I do not know what Desmond bane looks like. But in my head he feels likes 6""6 SF bald and a headband ripped af good 3pt shooter and dunker like idk why that's just the image from his name  Note I do already know he's a sf and a good 3pt shooter"
"You guys should be so pissed at your front office.  That Nesmith and Richardson got drafted back to back.   Trading up to draft Halliburton was an obvious move,  and trading Desmond Bane looked dumb when it happened.  That Langford can't get minutes is also awful.     Celtics are my 2nd NBA team. Management has killed them."
make a play for desmond bane
Grizzlies trail by 4. Desmond Bane is +20. In fact the whole Memphis starters are + lol. What an indictment on their bench.

"MVP: Ja Morant  ROTY: Ziaire Williams  DPOY: Dillon Brooks  6MOY: Desmond Bane/De'Anthony Melton  MIP: Jaren Jackson Jr.  Champion: Memphis Grizzlies (82-0, 16-0)"
"Great to see JJJ back! Good on D, scored some good blocks, just couldn't be as impactful on offense.   Ja Morant fucking rules. Desmond Bane is improving, which is expected from those that watched him last season.      Mobley + Allen is a great pairing for both offense and defense. But holy shit, Markannen should not be starting."
"Its just 1 game but Desmond Bane is winning MIP, lock it in."
"Really fun game.  Takeaways:  Cavs:  - Mobley is a fucking beast. First NBA game and dropping 17/9/6 on efficient shooting and with insane defense? - Jarrett Allen is a force in the paint, and with Mobley feeding him looks and clogging up the paint with him it looks like we have the frontcourt of our future. - Cedi Osman giveth and Cedi Osman taketh.  - Darius Garland looks legit but he still needs to work on his vision and aggressiveness. - We're suffering from a massive hole at wing which makes it impossible for us to run a decent rotation. We're either throwing out 3 6 footers or 3 7 footers, there's no in between lol  Grizzlies:  - Ja Morant.  - Desmond Bane looked incredible today.  - Melton was on fire, but not too surprised given the state of our perimeter D  - Did I mention Ja Morant?  - Glad to see Ziaire get out there and make an impact immediately.  - JJJ had a rough game offensively, especially inside, but made a huge impact on D. Dude is so good.  All around fun game!"
"20/10/21 Takeaways @MEM:   - Season opener!!!   - Allen was awesome on both ends   - Mobley is already amazing defensively, switching everything and good at the rim too   - Morant is filthy and nobody could stop him   - Great game from Cedi     - Rubio is essential for our team, him and Garland set up like all of our guys      - Garland shot bad first half but had 3 big threes in the 4th   - Both teams had pretty good ball movement, not many isos. Cavs switched a lot   - Idk if JB was trying to experiment but there were only like 70 different lineups in the first half. garland/sexton/okoro hardly played so it seems they’re pencilling in okoro/rubio as the 6th/7th men and having cedi/markkanen share SF minutes      - Desmond bane is legit   - JJJ was yeeting that shit like there was no tomorrow but they all somehow went in   - Markkanen is legitimately ass on the boards   - Really fun game overall, Cavs stayed with Memphis most of the game, except for a stretch in the 2nd where garland missed like 3 shots, in the 3rd where cedi turned the ball over twice and at the end. I can prolly count on my hand the number of times Cavs scored 120+ last season       Go Cavs!"
just a reminder that Danny Ainge gave away Desmond Bane last year just to show people that he was still making trades...
"Agree with all those points. My guess is they're hoping Ja takes another step forward, which is possible, the talent is certainly there. Expecting Jaren to stay on the floor is tough as well. I do like some of the depth pieces they have like Desmond Bane and Xavier Tillman. I personally agree with you they probably regress but the potential is there if Ja and Jaren are healthy"
Desmond Bane. Will be the bane of other teams' existences.
"Debating between Steven Adams, Desmond Bane ans De'Anthony Melton.  A defensive big for Ja and JJJ, a shooting guard/wing, or a utility guard that can rebound, steal, defend and shoot 3's."

"Not sure what desmond bane have to do with you declaring a 20 year old big man for sucking. Especially considering how there was no gleague last year so basically no arena for him to actually play and improve his game. Not sure what you expected him to learn since SL  MPJ can stil barely dribble.   and Europeans are wrong just as everyone else. Vlatko was always good, was starting for Slovenia winning eurocup before coming over easily comparable to Nnaji a guy Nuggets fans hadnt heard of until we drafted him.  And the difference between an early 2nd round pick and late first is minimal. Malik Beasley has nothing to do with it. Its not like it's more important to hit on picks aquired from trading a player."
Desmond Bane
"I'm 34. Been a diehard Nuggets fan when I was 7 and am a draft junkie with a pretty solid track record...  I wasn't expecting people to take that Zeke remark so seriously but it boils down to the fact that Xvaier Tillman and Desmond Bane were still on the board and would fit seamlessly on this roster.  Yes, Zeke is young and has a nice 3 point shot. Occasionally he also shows off solid perimeter D for his size.   But he has shown 0 growth as a player between summer league and preseason. He struggles with the ball in his hands, had a ridiculously low block rate in college and has shown 0 rim protection as a pro and is a bad passer."

"GGWP Raps, you guys are always tough to play. Scottie Barnes is really good and he's only going to get better ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ Desmond Bane is so good at basketball. JJJ is also good at basketball."
Is Desmond Bane someone that could be a solid 2nd option someday?  Looking forward to this Raptors squad once Gary Trent Jr and OG Anunoby are both back.. Scottie Barnes looks great
Desmond Bane is a real one
"Bit early to call but yeah, I tend to agree:   **2020**: Josh Green at 18 and left Saddiq Bey, Tyrese Maxey, Immanuel Quickley and Desmond Bane on the board.   **2019:** Dennis Smith Jr at 9 and left Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo and John Collins on the board.   Luka Doncic, Donovan Mitchell, Saddiq Bey, Kristaps Porzingis, Dwight Powell/Maxi Kleber."
"Adams was on a two year deal, and JV had a year remaining with a desire to be extended (NO gave him two more years). The Grizz are thought to planning to eventually move Jaren Jackson Jr. to the starting center.  Currently the point is to move more of the frontcourt offensive load to Jackson. Adams was supposed to provide defense and rebounding, and some protection for Jackson. In exchange for taking Adams and Eric Bledsoe, the Grizz moved up seven slots in this year’s draft, publicly saying they had intel that their target Ziaire Williams would be drafted before their pick. They also received the Lakers 2022 first round pick.   Eric Bledsoe lead to a domino effect of trades.   JV was a fan favorite in Memphis, but the org had no long term plans for him (just as they have none with Adams). JV played most of last season without Jackson, just like so far he’s been playing without Zion Williamson.   The true measure of the trade isn’t now; neither team was in the championship hunt. The measure for the Grizz will be years from now and how Williams does and what happens with that Lakers pick. One of the key rotation players for the Grizz, Desmond Bane was the 30th pick in the 2020 draft."
"so, how many more shots did he take?   because JV was traded to open up more shots for Ja, JJJ and Desmond Bane. They wanted someone to be more of an anchor. Why diss Steven when he's doing his role and JV is doing his?   fucking dumb ass comparison."
Desmond Bane pump fakes are filling the void at least
"Guys like Reggie Jackson, Cole Anthony &amp; Desmond Bane are all shorter guards with low releases and they all average more 3p attempts than Seth on similar to less minutes per game.  If you look at the league leaders in attempts per game there’s really no reason why Seth shouldn’t at least be in the top 50."
&gt; but Desmond Bane's still on his rookie deal and is already miles ahead of Allen  Is he really though? Allen has been way more efficient than Bane this season on only 2 ppg less. They seem pretty similar right now.
Love me some Desmond Bane. Absolutely no reason he should have fell so far in the draft like he did.
I really like Desmond Bane for some reason.

"Steph with his imperfect eyesight. A true underdog story.

The Grizz are low key our Achilles heel. Last year it was Morant and Grayson Allen lighting us up and this year it was Desmond bane and Morant. I kinda don’t wanna face them
"You see this is the problem with NBA front offices. They ignore guys that can actually play and go for guys that can barely dribble in hopes of fantasized “potential.” OKC hasn’t had a single pick work out for them since 2013 cause they fall in line w this thinking too. Saddiq’s a multipositional defender that shoots the three efficiently at volume - every team needs a guy like that  There’s no way Saddiq shoulda fell to 19. Or Desmond Bane at 30. Or this year, Herb Jones at 35. FO’s ignore the NBA ready guys and take gambles that often don’t pan out"

"Is it just me or does Desmond Bane just look weird out in the court, like something bout his arms"
"Kevin Harlan: ""you ever eat pussy Reg?""  Reggie Miller: ""sure do Kevin. my wife loves it. and you gotta give some to get some""  Kevin Harlan: ""exactly. hey, she's sucking you off, right? Desmond Bane with the 3"""
"We weren’t going to pay GA or JV. We were able to trade up and get another first rounder for JV, and GA minutes get freed up for Desmond Bane who should end up being better than Allen."
desmond bane going the fuck off this year
Desmond Bane fighting hard for MIP
You ready for something really spicy?  Desmond Bane is going to go down as a better shooter than JJ Redick after all is said and done.
Desmond Bane
Desmond Bane just cash money over all lmao. That man's off the dribble pull up from midrange always swishes it feels like. Plus that pump take three pointer is sweet
Love the griz man Ja Morant is probably the most exciting player this year and my man Desmond Bane has won me more money than I could of imagined. Desmond bane over 12.5 pts has been a cash cow 🔒
"reminder that the mastermind himself, Danny Ainge, basically gave Desmond Bane and M.Thybulle away for nothing - put those 2 on the Celtic roster right now and they are the favorites in the East imo."
"I mean outside of LaMelo (who is clearly the best) and Edwards (who is clearly the 2nd best), he could reasonably end up in 3rd.   Currently, he's competing for that 3rd place spot with Cole Anthony, Tyrese Haliburton, and Desmond Bane (Patrick Williams would be up there too but he's hurt)"
Just gotta note that Desmond Bane is huge. Don’t want the smoke w him.
Ainge also traded the desmond bane pick to dump kanter's contract. Ainge was a great GM but it was like he got basketball dementia his last 2 years
"&gt;  jaden mcdaniels looks like the steal of the 2020 draft and was the best defensive rookie in the league as the 28th pick.  IQ was picked 3 picks before him and hes been better  desmond bane was picked 2 picks after him and outplayed him last night   &gt;naz reid was undrafted and has become one of the most underrated backup centres in the league, and he’s one of the best 3pt shooting centres too.  actually agree with all of this will always endorse naz reid would love to have him on the hornets  &gt;okogie at 20 wasnt a world beater but getting a solid rotation player there is still a win.   he's not a rotation player? more of a sporadic player, on one of the worst teams in the league. not to mention offensively non existent?  &gt;he traded roco, keita bates diop, and some scrubs (vonleh, napier, bell) for malik beasley, jarred vanderbilt, and a first round pick.   roco is the best piece in this trade if the goal is to win basketball games  &gt;youre judging a GM on win percentage? thats straight up idiotic. i guess neil olshey is a better GM than sam presti, or kleiman in memphis, or rosas just because he won more games? fuck no.  you act as if all gm situation are created equal and all of those guys traded away a first round pick the next year basically saying ""we are competing"" then won 23 games, thats remarkable incompetence  and his encore roster looks like it might win 20-25 again  and last i checked the objective was to win games and his tenure not only put the wolves nowhere near doing that, it put them farther away   that is why it is fair to judge him on win percentage when not only did he sabotage their future he managed to sabotage their present as well"
Why was Desmond Bane excited lol.
"Nailed it.  Shoutout to Desmond Bane, Anfernee Simons &amp; Grayson Allen too.  Grayson’s giving us 15 PPG shooting 40% from 3 making 3.5 3PM a game."
"Clearly is not the best third option, but Desmond Bane is playing really good right now"
"Terrence Ross, Derozan, Desmond Bane, Herro.  Bench gunners and lean forwards that can create their own shot and for others are perfect 3rd bananas IMO historically guys like Love, Bosh, Draymond, FVV, Ginobili etc"
Desmond Bane is legit
Desmond Bane was listed as a forward yesterday which just cracked me up.
&gt;#####A new season means new players stepping to the forefront. Here are a handful who look like they could make a leap two weeks into 2021-22.  --- Included players:  &gt;* Miles Bridges {CHA} * Ja Morant {MEM} * Tyler Herro {MIA} * OG Anunoby {TOR} * Cole Anthony {ORL} * Harrison Barnes {SAC} * Desmond Bane {MEM} * Jakob Poeltl {SAS} * Cam Reddish {ATL} * Mo Bamba {ORL}
"I can tell you now Desmond Bane,De’anthony Melton, and Kyle Anderson will never be all stars"
"Man, the Bull commentators have to be the best in the business. They provide excellent insight and don't let homerism impact how they view the action. Plus, they're just fun! That Doc Brown tangent was amazing. Almost up there with them imitating The Dark Knight's Bane when Desmond Bane was playing against the Bulls. Plus, how can you not like Stacey King's catch phrases?  In short, they're a national treasure."
uh...what?  Reminder that this team could easily have Desmond Bane and M.Thybulle right now had idiot boy Ainge not made deals just to show people he was still doing stuff....his return on the trades for those two?  Pretty much nothing.
"Trading JV for Adams was fine, worst case scenario he falls off later in the season and we don't make the playoffs.   Desmond Bane is a legit player, Boston must be kicking themselves for trading him away and keeping Nesmith and Pritchard over him, (not that they even wanted to draft him.)  Ja Morant is an allstar calibre player. 1st in total points, 7th in total assists, hopefully his shooting keeps up for the rest of the season.    Jaren is still fouling too much and his shots aren't falling. I'd be very happy if one of those two things stopped happening."
"If you look at our first 8 games it's actually literally the toughest stretch of the entire season for us. So to be looking at emerging from that as .500 or better is awesome, especially considering we're missing an impactful starter who should be back soon.  Desmond Bane and Deanthony Melton are both the real deal, and watching them develop in front of our eyes is awesome. Bane is in contention for one of the smoothest jumpers in the league right now.  Ja is an all-star this year, no cap.  Jaren hasn't had the breakout some expected, and Ziaire is just as raw as predicted, although I feel he's been growing steadily.  Grizzly Adams is a great fit. Xavier Tillman should get more minutes than Brandon Clarke. Slow Mo is a professional competitor, whose shot has regressed because the hitch is back. Tyus is the definition of solid, over 20 assists and 1 TO so far.  That's pretty much it"
1. Anthony Edwards  2. Lamelo Ball  3. Cole Anthony   4. Tyrese Haliburton  5. Saddiq Bey / Desmond Bane / Jaden McDaniels / Tyrese Maxey
"&gt;Why not? At this point both of those players have shown far more than Wiseman has.  Because this is not how NBA teams think, Desmond Bane is a polished 23 years old who was projected to contribute off the bat, but pretty much no scouts saw a future star."
"Desmond Bane, was a stud for the Grizzlies last year and is still playing really well. He's an efficient 2/3 sophomore   https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/banede01.html"
Desmond Bane is gonna beat him sorry.
"Desmond Bane is winning this Award, sorry guys."
"Might be a homer for you lol   Check my flair I think Jaden Mcdaniels could’ve gone #5 also, also listed Cole Anthony and Desmond Bane too."
Might need to put Desmond Bane on the list the way he's been playing.
Desmond bane  Cole Anthony  Jaden Mcdaniels   Could all be picked at 5
I think Edwards would still go 1. Also I think Desmond Bane would go top 5 probably over Beef Stew
"Timelord also continues to struggle with conditioning issues and honestly I think the mentorship of Horford will help a long way.   On the bright side, the pairing of Timelord/Horford is a lot stronger on paper than Theis/TT. Timelord's athletic enough to defend the perimeter and Horford's one of the better volume 3-point shooting centers in the league (better than Myles Turner actually - last season Horford shot 37% on 5.5 attempts per game).   That all being said, I do think you're right that having both Jays in the frontcourt is probably the best route to go. Ainge should not have traded away Desmond Bane for peanuts."
"And then as we all know Stevens attached a first to get off Kemba's contract for an overpaid Al Horford. I still think it's kind of funny that Boston didn't want to give Horford the bag and now Horford's back on the Celtics.  Also I'm pretty sure that 2020 protected first was Desmond Bane LMAO.  You can't blame Ainge for when Hayward snapped his ankle but he did sit on his assets for a lot longer than he should have. Hopefully Presti uses the Ainge tenure as an example of what not to do, even if that means having to grease your transactions with extra picks to make them go through."
I get what you're saying and in theory it shouldn't be hard to find a decent 2-guard to plug into the lineup so you can put the Jays in the frontcourt.  Remember when Ainge traded Desmond Bane away for future seconds? What a waste.
"I don't disagree with you man. Draft guys are so obsessed with finding the next big thing that they ignore sure-fire hits, especially if they're later in the draft when you're more likely to find a bust than a serviceable rotation player.  For example there's no way in hell that Desmond Bane should have fallen to the last pick of the 1st round in 2020. Ridiculous."

&gt;That was my biggest problem with Harden specifically- dude is probably pound for pound the most muscled up dude in the league  Wait are you saying people muscle him up? Or he himself is muscled up? Cuzz I gotta check you - Desmond Bane is a muscle quasar
"Desmond Bane was the guy I was hoping Toronto picked up in the draft last year, I’m glad to see him doing well"
There’s more than this but Tyler Herro &amp; Desmond Bane
I really like Desmond Bane
Desmond Bane averaging like 20ppg. He’s a stud
Ja gets all the attention on the Grizzlies but last year's #30 overall pick Desmond Bane is averaging 19pts on 48/43/87 splits
this sounds positive but he ain’t winning MIP because apparently Desmond Bane decided to become an all star
Desmond Bane
I love mentioning the fact that the Celtics had that Desmond Bane pick and traded it away for nothing.
Desmond Bane
"Desmond Bane was born in the darkness, molded by it!"
Ja is getting all the attention (and for good reason) but Desmond Bane has been quietly very good in the absence of Brooks. 19pts on close to 50/40/90 shooting so far this season
i dont think a lot of people know how good desmond bane is
