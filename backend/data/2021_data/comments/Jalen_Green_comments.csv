"Yes, and next season with Wiseman second season and Jalen Suggs or Green running the second team with Paschall as sixth man will easily put Warriors ahead of LA teams"
"Jalen Brunson, Jamychael Green"
Weltman actually drafted isaac but yeah I agree hopefully all of our injuries could be a blessing in disguise and we can get cade jalen green kuminga and suggs out of it who can all possibly be franchise players.
"Pop and Buford been doing weird things since Duncan retired.  Like giving a 36yo Pau Gasol a 3 year 45 million contract.  If any year is the year to tank, this gotta be it with Cade, Mobley, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Johnson, Zaire coming in the draft. Move LMA and maybe even DD to a contender for picks or some young pieces."
"Great list, for the players not in the league yet, smart money would be on Cade Cunningham, Emoni Bates, Evan Mobley, Chet Holgrem, Jalen Green."
" Might as well join the FadeForCade Sweepstakes. Lots of talent in the 21 Draft, Evan Mobley, although the Mavs could use a pure scorer too like Jalen Green, Zaire Williams or Jalen Johnson.  Would bubble playoff teams rather have a Top 7 pick in this year's draft?"

"Netting that extra pick could be huge. If they land someone like Jalen Green, a young core around Wiggins and Wiseman could keep GSW in contention long after the Splash Bro’s decline without tanking or rebuilding"
As a half asian myself I'd count him. Catch Jalen Green seizing the Asian NBA crown in the future (I hope)
I want that to happen imagine yall get Kuminga or Jalen Green that’s scary
"Three huge differences: the rockets and harden relationship was publically toxic, Brooklyn flipped unprotected picks that will likely be extremely valuable with all their stars into their 30s, besides kyrie (vs your offer where Memphis is virtually guaranteed to be in the playoffs throughout the 7 seasons you are allowed to trade picks for), AND Tillman Frittata refused to take the better offer of Ben simmons who was on the table, because he's a fuckstick.  The wizards have a good relationship, beal is not harden, the picks available from Memphis are nowhere near as valuable potentially, and I just think yer full stop wrong that teams won't flip young talent for beal.  I dont want the dubs flipping wiseman for him, and I don't think they will, but you absolutely have the convo.  &gt;Jalen Green, Zaire Williams, Chet Holmgen, Patrick Baldwin, Emoni Bates, etc.  Re-sign beal and you can pair any of these guys with him to begin with..."
"I also don’t think those guys you mentioned will be included in any trade as with a player considerably better than Beal in Harden the rockets did not get a player back that is as valuable as JJJ. They got possibly 1 year of Oladipo, two players worse than any of the players Memphis will offer and a bunch of picks and swaps. I would take Memphis’ young pieces with team control for longer than Oladipo and maybe 2 less picks/swaps over the package for Harden and that’s James Harden we’re talking about not Bradley Beal.  I understand the whole ticket selling perspective, but I think in 1.5 seasons or so you can have that right back with someone like Jalen Green, Zaire Williams, Chet Holmgen, Patrick Baldwin, Emoni Bates, etc."
"They need to let go of Jaren Jr. AND Clarke if they want this to happen. Tillman can just slot in as their new starting 4, he’s already ready for big minutes anyway.  JJJ, Clarke, Melton, Brooks + picks. Works salary-wise. WAS should sneak tank the rest of the way to get a lineup of:  Starters: Russ, Jalen Green, Avdija, Bertans, JJJ  Bench: Melton, Brooks, Rui, Clarke, Bryant"
"2019: PJ Washington  2020: Jalen Smith, Deni Avidja. I'm high on all of the wings from last year's draft as well (Okoro, Nesmith, Saddiq Bey, Josh Green)"
"We are have been missing our 2nd-6th best players for almost half the season, as a result we've had to start 3rd stringers, rookies and G-league players, who are shooting at a historically low % from 3. Defenders do not respect our 3PT shooters so they clog the paint and leave guys like Wes Iwundu wide open for 3. (He's shooting 14% on the year). This means Luka isn't able to drive into the paint, and has to take mid range shots and 3s. His 3s are not good, but a lot of it stems from defenders not having to guard 3 of our starters (WCS, Iwundu and Green) and instead double or triple teaming Luka at all times.   The below players are our primary rotation guys from the past few weeks. Just absolutely awful.   WCS was let go from the Sacramento Kings, he's garbage. He is like 9/14 on dunks this season and a washed DeMarcus Cousins lit him up for 28/17/5. WCS is a -30 in his last 7 games.  Wes Iwundu is shooting 14.3% from 3 and 31.7% from the field. He is shooting 16.7% on wide open (nearest defender is 6+ feet away) 3 pointers. He's had one of the worst 3pt shooting seasons ever.  Josh Green is shooting 9% from 3. Green and Iwundu are posting 89 and 90 ORTG and 112 and 113 DRTG.  Boban is 7'4 and has not recorded a single block in 100 minutes of play. He is a nonexistent rim protector, cannot space the floor, cannot guard the perimeter and is slow. He's efficient in the low post and has good hands, that's about it.  THJ has been solid but wildly inconsistent. He's averaging 17.5 PPG on 38% from 3. His defense is below average, and he will have a 30 point game then proceed to shoot 0-12 and have 0 points like he did in Toronto. THJ has had 8 games shooting 38% or lower from the field (4 games of 0-30%), and then 4 games shooting 60-78% from the field.  Jalen Brunson has been great for us but he missed a lot of games. He's probably been our 2nd or 3rd best player as of late, despite only averaging 12 ppg and 3.5 apg.  Porziņģis missed 10 games so far, and is shaking off rust. He's averaging 19 ppg 47/29.5/82 shooting. His defense has been very poor and he's been a negative on court through 7 games.  James Johnson is nothing more than a back up big, he's shooting 3s at 31%, his defense is average and he makes some bad decisions.  That's our current rotation.  Luka, 1-3 average level starters (Porziņģis is a fringe all star usually, but has not been thus far in the season), and then a bunch of end of bench guys and rookies."
JALEN GREEN COME TO THE BAY BBY
Filipino in me excited for Jalen Green and Kai
That's a short ass season. Excited to see jalen green hoop
"That 2021 Draft is gonna be one of the most loaded in recent memory.  Cade, Mobley, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, Zaire Williams, Scottie Barnes, Kuminga. Jalen Johnson."
"Jalen Green is my favorite prospect in this draft, so I know."
They have two top-five prospects on their team that’s why they’re hyped. Jalen Green could be the #2 pick. Watch his highlights he has major bounce.
How has this team gotten so much hype? I have never heard of Jalen Green before.
"not just top, Jalen Green might be the best pure scorer in the draft and was the #2 prospect out of high school. Both of these guys would have probably been the #1 overall pick had they been in last year's draft. A lot of people have knocked them down to 4-7 in mocks simply due to the fact that Suggs and Mobley have been killing it in college, but this is def their chance to try to earn being 2nd/3rd overall picks"
he is already eligible. Jalen Green is still considered american afaik. Both him and Jordan Clarkson could possibly play for us but I think there are nationality hoops they need to jump.
I hope Jalen Green plays for the Philippines. We need all the talent we can get.
"Specifically about Asians, not necessarily JapaneseI guess it depends on if we're counting Asian or Asian-American.   If the later, Jordan Clarkson is Filipino. Spo is also half Filipino.   Kanter of course is Turkish.  Jalen Green and Kai Satto are both in g league ignite. And I guess if we're counting Asian Americans and g leaguers Jeremy Lin would fall into that list too!"
"Not sure about 2 top 6/7 but I think 1 and a top 15.  My top pick is definitely cade, fits like a glove.  Jalen green is next although the fit is meh but I'm not Vlade"
I'm gonna enjoy drafting Jalen Green at 5 after we lose the lottery
"If they land the Wolves pick outside the Top 3 in 2021, this team is gonna be stacked again.  Steph - Klay - Wiggins - Oubre - Draymond - Wiseman - Paschall - Looney - Wanamaker - Bazemore  And one of Jonathan Kuminga, Jalen Suggs. Jalen Green, Scottie Barnes or Zaire Williams."
"&gt;Word on the street is that Jalen Green is kind of like Kobe Bryant, but with better touch  Quality bait snuck in to the middle.  Have my upvote sir, I got a good chuckle."
"Keep the pick and see if we can get one of: Jalen Green, Kuminga, Ziaire Williams"
"If Jalen Green/Kai Sotto somehow goes to the Warriors or the Lakers, it's gonna be full blown Filipino master race"
you know i gotta rep Jalen Green the same reasons i rep Jordan Clarkson lol
Jalen Green baby
Filipino Warrior fans would finance Chase alone in jersey sales for Jalen Green
"No, I'm not high on Kai Sotto. I mean like Jalen Green or Kuminga. Kids that are already lottery prospects that could show out"
Who we gonna take?  Suggs?  Mobley?  Lil' Kobe Jalen Green?
Jalen Green?  Jalen Suggs?  Evan Mobley?
"Yeesh. Nasty sprain right there. I'd start watching some Jalen Green, Cade Cunningham, Jalen Suggs highlights if I was a Rockets fan"
Yeah four would be devastating in this deep draft. Right now it looks like the #4 and #5 players are Jalen Green and Jonathan Kuminga who are so promising that the G League made a team just for them.
"i'm sorry but people aren't watching games. Wiggins has been playing really fucking good D. Watch a few games and then chime in.   Warriors absolutely won the trade. If the pick is #4, we getting Jalen Green. If the pick is 2022, then shit it might become #1 with how bad Wolves are trending"
shit can you imagine if jalen green backs up Steph next year? shit....
Then Jalen Green*
Hell of alot of talent this year.  Jalen green looks tremendous and he's not even top 3 atm
"Cade, Mobley, Suggs, Kuminga all look like phenomenal players. Guys like Jalen Green and Ziaire are ballers too"

"The jays are pretty efficient bro and the nets defense is pretty shit so yeah I think they can match the offensive production What they lack in offense they mack up for in being better defenders than anyone on the nets.  Kemba though idk. He looked horrible in the playoffs last year. If we replaced kemba with the third Jay bro it would be a match up, but I can't imagine him guarding kyrie and he's not going to be amazing on offense either.  Nets win for sure but Jay's put up solid match up with hopeful addition of Jalen Green."
Jalen Green places a forlorn hand on the window.
lol i feel you.  the knicks have me watching jalen green highlights on my phone when we have the ball these days.
"Cade in Detroit doesn’t seem bad. Killian brings the ball up, Cade makes the plays. Jalen Green gonna play himself back up to that 3 spot my prediction"

Bruh let’s hope we loose this. Jalen Green isn’t going to get here without us tanking.
"does this include the ignite team (the one with Jalen Green, Kuminga, etc)?"
&gt;lmao Curry remembers he has a personal vendetta against the Clippers  throw in Jalen Green with the #4 pick too
At that point you’re probably building your franchise around jalen green or something
"long as we can see jalen green, Todd, and Kuminga play then we good. They are the top reason why the avg fan would watch"

Jalen Green x Ja Morant back court PLEASE AND THANK YOU
my little cousin would love if the Raps drafted Jalen Green. He watches all his highlights lol
"They're guaranteed a top 4 pick no matter what .  That means they get Suggs, Cade, Jalen Green, Kuminga, Mobley , one of those guys... the fuck is wrong with that"
"i think the league will take care of the missing money with expansion, but not with the 2. The g-league is the next great money maker for the league. once they get teams out of Canton and put them in real cities so they can feature real prospects (how sick would it be if each state had a team any in-state prospect could join?), that will dramatically increase revenue. The pandemic sucks because we should be able to watch Jalen Green and Jon Kuminga right now.   also the league should invest 5B into streaming their own games and cutting ABC and ESPN out of the pie. the NBA can hire camera crews and on air talent and stream directly to the consumer. they can run their own ads.     i really think Cuban knows all of this and wants to keep it at 1/30 and not 1/32 or more"
"&gt;Jalen Green, and the word on him is that he's Kobe Bryant, but with better touch.   Those scouts should take it easy with the comparisons!"
Jalen Green.
"You can’t go wrong with top 7 IMO. I’d take each of them over any of the top prospects in 2020.  Cade, jalen Suggs, jalen green, jalen Johnson, kuminga, mobley, Scottie barnes."
did u just call jalen Green a better kobe

Don't beat many teams for Jalen Green
You traded potentially a Cade Cunningham or Jalen Green for him ... jesus ...
"Warriors will probably end up tanking this season for a top 5 pick, and try to nab one of Cade/Suggs/Jalen Green.  The Wolves pick likely ends up in the lottery.  Next year's roster could realistically look like:  Steph, Klay, Wiggins, Draymond, Wiseman  Suggs, Kispert, Oubre, Paschall + some randos  That takes the team from 1 shotmaker to 4 instantly, with 2 players who can handle the ball / iso when needed.  This team can compete while not sacrificing the future either.  Warriors can have their cake and eat it too.  I actually love how the team is positioned going forward, it's far from doom and gloom."
Prince + a few mins work to meet the necessary salary range. People forget we’re paying Prince 12m/year. You only need to hit like 15m to match.  Sixers could do the same with Danny Green who makes 15.5m. Danny Green + Mike Scott = 20m.  Pacers could do Jeremy Lamb + Doug McDermott as filler.  Suns could do Dario Saric + Jae Crowder or one of them + Jalen Smith + a few mins
The fuck are the hornets doing i'm salivating over that Jalen green pick rn
"Cade is both  A. Much more skilled at basketball than Jalen Green, and almost certainly has better natural feel in general  B. The slowest perimeter player I've ever seen get considered for a first round pick  Drafting is hard"
just wait till jalen green pull up next yr
Jalen Green gotta be in this next year he’s insanely athletic
this is honestly a blessing in disguise for them.   they would've been the 7th/8th seed if not for all the injuries. probably higher if we include Isaac. but still not even close to being a contender.   but now they'll more than likely end up with a top-5 pick. Jalen Green would be nasty with the magic.   PG: Fultz  SG: Green  SF: Isaac  PF: Gordon/Chuma  C: Vooch
"Imagine how good they would be if they drafted haliburton instead of jalen green who is in the gleague now. I had no idea why they drafted him this high, when if they really wanted him they could have traded down 5-10 spots and still gotten him plus something else"
"Sorry man didn't mean to sound condescending . It's just I mentioned him in the previous post . I haven't been up on the high school prospects I usually try to stay on top on that . I should start reading slam again found that kept me in loop . Ya these next few drafts are stacked man . Interested to see how this year's plays out . I think Jalen green is being slept on cuz he went to the g league seems like that moves helped kumingas stock more than anyone. Late lottery guys like Scottie Barnes look solid. Wonder the next big deal is when LeBron hangs it up . Seems like doncic , it sounds like emoni  Bates is the next generational talent from north America."
Jalen Green soon too.
"In my opinion, Jalen Green is going to be great in the NBA. A player that he reminds me of is Zach Lavine."
Expecting Jalen Green to develop elite handles and shooting when he’s been bad for his entire career is so improbable it’s not worth taking into account.   Technically Kevin from down the street could develop into Steph Curry with kyrie’s handles and Gary Payton’s defense. That’s still not worth considering
I meant shooter. Anyway this discussion isn’t getting anywhere. I recommend watching more of Cade and Jalen Green if you somehow have him above.
"Again, Cade has a  better handle then Jalen Green. Green’s archetype requires handle more. Also, you seem to be ignoring the fact that Cade is the 4th most efficient isolation player in the country. How does he do that if he can’t beat people off the dribble and isn’t an elite shooter"
&gt;Hates on Cade for a bad handle and struggling to get open off the dribble. Proceeds to say Jalen green is the best prospect in the class  It’s not hating if it’s true...  &gt;Lol mate idk if you're trolling but Jalen Green has a significantly worse handle while also being 3 inches shorter  Jalen Green is significantly more athletic.

"Probably hyperbole. He’s above average at essentially everything, elite at nothing. Jack of all trades.  I’d take Jalen Green and maybe Kuminga over him but that’s it."
Really? Kuminga started strong and has sorta stagnated. While his teammate in Jalen Green started mediocre and has improved so much so that he's now IMO the best player on the Ignite team.
Jalen Green we coming for you
Jalen Green gonna look so good in orlando
"The core is Allen, Garland, Sexton, Nance Jr, Okoro, and whoever they draft is gonna be wonderful down the line. Imagine if they end up with a go-to scorer like Jalen Green?   The east will run through cleveland"
What helps me get to sleep lately is thinking of getting Cade and Jalen Green in this draft.
"I didn’t know we wanted Jalen Green that bad.  I’m okay with tanking, I just wish we were informed."
Can someone tell me if Jalen Green is NBA ready?
Damn. Maybe Jalen green Cs fam. He even has the green in his name
The Celtics are just tanking so they can get Jalen Green and assemble all the Jalens
"Warriors getting 1 of the following then:  Jalen Green, Jonathan Kuminga, Jalen Suggs, Zaire Williams.   Unless the basketball Gods save the league from a Steph-Klay-Wiggins-Draymond-Wiseman with Green off the bench.  And let the T'Wolves select Cade or Mobley."
This would help us get Jalen Green or Cade. I’m on board with it
We want Jalen Green that bad huh
Jordan Clarkson   Jalen Green   Kai Sotto   With Spo coaching. The Philippines dream team!
"Raptors would have Norman Powell, Danny Green, Patrick McCaw, Terence Davis, Tyrese Maxey, Matt Thomas, and Malachi Flynn, and Jalen Harris all vying for minutes at the 2."
Jalen Green got a hype man
&gt; **Starters:** Jalen Green
I have coins from being awarded and love Jalen Green.   (⌐■_■)
"Surely it's tempting to hope you stay in the lottery to somehow pick up Jalen Green?      **Starters:** Markelle Fultz, Jalen Green, Jonathan Isaac, Aaron Gordon, Nikola Vucevic.    **Bench:** Cole Anthony, Dwayne Bacon, Terrence Ross, Chuma Okeke, Mo Bamba."
you can have jalen green

Isaiah Todd who was ranked like 13th in 2020 went the g league route and he rarely plays. Seems like it worked out for jalen green and the other top guy though
"Well to each their own.   I did miss 1 point. The average basketball fan has never watched a G league game, could not tell you 5 g league team names &amp; cities, and does not know what Ignite is or who Jalen Green is."
You’ll get all of that once you get drafted. Also do you see how much ESPN and social media are talking about Jalen Green and Jon Kuminga. Jalen Green already has 1.1 Million followers on Ig. I can almost guarantee he has some models trying to throw pussy at him
"Ayton got paid 10000 a month while at Arizona. Jalen Green got 500,000 for 1 year"
"Jalen Green and Kuminga have been getting a bunch of shine. ESPN has really been pushing their games like crazy.  I also don’t think fan relevancy matters. Scouts 100% will look at you in the g league, especially for one year. I also think scouts can grade you on a curve since you’re playing against grown men"
"Closer to the FadeForCade Sweepstakes now, but a Jalen Green or Jonathan Kuminga fits their team more than another guard, even if Cade has drawn Grant Hill/Ben Simmons/Luka comparisons."
Ahead of Jalen Green and Evan Mobley?
Depends on if the Minny pick conveys this year and the Warriors end up lucking into Jalen Green or Kuminga.  Then Oubre would not be re-signed.  Bazemore would be a much cheaper replacement in that scenario.
Imagine Minny's pick is 4th/5th and the Warriors get to draft Jalen Green/Kuminga/any elite 3&amp;D wing 1st out there...sheesh
"draft picks are 2/3 so far. Saddiq(especially) and Stewart are steals. Not sure yet on Killian he looked roughed even before the injury and I'm not sold on him.  Especially with Jalen green, kuminga, and Cade around the corner"
Jalen Green?
"If the guard is named either Cade Cunningham, Jalen Green, or Jalen Suggs then sure"
"&gt; half-Filipino Jalen Green  Jalen is 1/8 Filipino. His great-grandfather is Filipino.  https://www.espn.com/basketball/story/_/id/22832152/fil-jalen-green-displays-all-game-nbtc  &gt; ""My grandfather on my dad's side is the Filipino,"" shared his mother Brie."
"This whole Jalen Green Phillipines thing I've been seeing on the internet recently has been really weird. I obviously respect the pride that comes from seeing someone with similar ancestral roots succeeding and what not, but his wiki says his mother has Filipino heritage through her grandfather. Unless that's wrong, that means he had a Filipino great-grandparent."
Those probably came from Filipinos. They’ve been starved of legit basketball talent that they’ve decided to adopt Jalen Green as their own similar to Jordan Clarkson. They have 0 NBA players that originated there so they’re desperately claiming Americans with Filipino blood as “their” players. I’ve tried watching some of their best local players but even their MVP’s do not have the potential or skills to get playing time in the G League.  Jalen Green at best is just the next Justice Winslow.
"You know they say all Philippinos are created equal, but you look at Jalen Green and Kai Sotto and you can see that statement is not true. See normally when you go 1-on-1 with another player, you get a 50/50 chance of winning but Green is a halfsie and is not normal so you get a 25-percent chance at beat him. And then you add Jarrett Jack to the mix??!"
"He's gonna get so much money/fame/pussy in the Philippines if he goes top 3, much more if he's #1  Filipinos haven't fully claimed him yet, \#PinoyPride posts will get crazy after he gets drafted  I don't know what Kai Sotto was thinking trying to enter the draft the same time as half-Filipino Jalen Green. Maybe that's why he peaced out on Ignite"
Jalen Green posts are the new LeBron posts
I know Kuminga has been the talk of the town in the G league but Jalen Green has been just as good imo.

[nba draft rooms’ comparisons appear to be very sporadic ](https://nbadraftroom.com/p/jalen-green/)
You can probably debate jalen green at this point
"Same with Filipinos. Low-key excited for Jalen Green though. He could be the best filipino ever since his competition is non-existent. Jordan Clarkson (only current filipino in the league), Sedrick Barefield (gleaguer, now overseas), Kobe Paras (Creighton then quit), Aaron Craft (would've never guessed he was Filipino) and Kai went back to the Philippines."
"Basketball aside, wouldn't it be better to join the FadeForCade Sweepstakes?   And, even if you get Pick 2 or 3, which would be a better fit? Mobley? Jalen Green?"
Is Jalen Green asian?
"Cade and Mobley are off the table so choices are at this rate could be Suggs, Kuminga, Jalen Green etc. If the Wolves get the top pick this year and they suck the ff season, we have the chance to get ourselves Holmgren/Bates"
"Spurs needed Dejounte to play lights out to squeak by the Warriors the other day. Love Pop and all, but the team is in Flux and in danger of settling for above average but never championship material.  Always wondered if it's better for them to trade LaMarcus and Derozan to contenders and go all-in for the 2021 Draft. Also, grooming Becky Hammon and Will Hardy to take over one day.  Dejounte, White, Keldon, Vassell, Lonnie, maybe Samanic are solid pieces but none have that Mega star quality. Might get it with Jalen Green, Mobley, for sure Cade and maybe Emoni the 2022 draft.   As for Steph and the Warriors, they play like clockwork, it looks so effortless at times. The screens and movement to get open looks, the switches and rotations on defense. Who knew Kerr would be this kickass of a tactical coach!"
Petition to make Jalen Green eligible to participant in it and be the first non NBA player to win an NBA dunk contest
Kuminga and Jalen Green are the only high level ones right now but you can check the ignite teams roster
"Kuminga, Jalen Green, Kai Sotto, and Isaiah Todd. Could be more but these are off the top of my head."
"Not only did that game feature NBA veterans, it also featured Jalen Green and Kuminga, future lottery picks for the upcoming draft. Yes, a lot of people were watching."
He's mainly doing it to help mentor the prospects like Jalen Green and Jonathan Kuminga on team Ignite
Jalen Green to the Bay Area!!!!
"if Jalen Green is as good as he progresses in 2k when you import his draft class, he will be the greatest player of all time and be the all-time leading scorer by age 36. i’d even take him over Iguodala."
I’d draft Jalen green in a heartbeat
"Still flabbergasting how a 5-consecutive finals team can get back-to-back Top 5 draft picks.  And the 2021 Draft is deep as hell. Cade, Mobley, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Johnson, Zaire, Scottie, etc."
Jalen Green is the better play but not by much. I'd take both of them over Suggs though.
"Jalen Green at #4 would be an absolute steal. If you really want a forward take Kuminga, his body is nba ready."
I'll take Jalen Green with Warriors

"Spurs best suited to trade LMA to a contender and go all-in on the youth and rebuild movement. Get another lottery piece to go along with White-Dejounte-Lonnie-Devin-Keldon. Maybe a Jalen Green if lucky, Jalen Suggs, Kuminga, Jalen Johnson, or Zaire Williams.  Mavs need to get healthy and stay healthy, but they may still be missing a piece or two.  Rockets - very impressive post-Harden era and they haven't fully gelled yet. Wall-Dipo-Gordon-Woods-Tucker-Cousins-House-Nwaba is a solid rotation."
I really hope that Jalen Green helps pave the way to prove that the G-League is better for development for the top tier prospects.
"Some of the takes are puzzling. Definitely some NOLA bias here. But hey if you are going down this road here is mine:  Best future potential:  Team A = Whoever ends up with Cade  He looks like a generational player and a total package. No weakness (there are but I have a feeling they are temporary).  Longshot Prediction - Jalen Green has the highest ceiling I have seen... since I cant remember when. But he is raw and needs a coach who will take a chance on him and put him at point. His ceiling is something else. If he develops the way I think he can, then...   Team B = Whoever ends up with Jalen Green"
Jalen Green.   Come back in 5 years trust me I'm woke
Jalen Green  I promise he will be the next superstar
"&gt;	trying to remember the name  Johnson? Springer? Suggs? Green? Shit Masai, which jalen/jaden did we want?"
"I disagree. In no world are we beating the heat with dragic butler bam dipo herro robinson iggy and all the rest. Especially their coach lol. The only reason their record is bad is because their best players missed so many games. We have no chance against the heat. Especially against a healthy butler.  And like I said before I'm not saying to just throw in the towel and tank. All I said was to miss the playoffs. Same way u guys missed the playoffs and got ja with 30 wins, that's literally what I'm saying the bulls should do. We've been tanking for 4 years. Not a lot.   We beat 2 teams missing both of their two best players. Zach is playing hurt. He's nit gonna play the same until they rest him and he's way to stubborn to do it anyway. As easily as u think we can end up with the 5th seed, is as easily as I believe we can miss the play in entirely.    Would u want the grizzlies to make the playoffs this year and get gutted by the jazz? Or would u rather have a chance at jalen green or cade and guys like that? Ur in a similar spot as well. Besides that u actually have a young floor general and actual nice young guys like Clarke and JJJ and that buff bane guy that all share similar time lines.  Bulls have Zach vuc and pat. And probably thad. That's it. Everyone else doesn't matter. Thad and Vuc are already 30 too. We got maybe 4 years together with these 4 guys? And at best we're first round exits. Sorry dude but making the playoffs and getting smashed just sounds so fucking stupid to me. I just want a chance to actually be great. And the lottery gives teams that chance."
Jalen green IMO will be the bonafide superstar out of this class. Elite scorer and athleticism.   The best floor contributor will be Mitchell
Mobley and Suggs are also both overrated  Jalen green is better than both of them
Jalen Green is 1/8 Filipino (his great-grandfather was Filipino).
"1. Washington - Cade Cunningham, PG, OKlahoma St.   2. Magic - Jalen Green, G, G League  3. Raptors - Jalen Suggs, G, Gonzaga  4. Sacramento - Evan Mobley, C, USC  5.

Magic - James Bouknight, SG, UConn"
"Unfortunately, Wizards would say no to that unless the Minny pick conveys as Jalen Green or Jalen Suggs.  Also, 3-guard lineup of Steph-Beal-Klay?"
Jalen Green is also pretty big in the philippines
Markelle Fultz / Cole Anthony   Jalen Green / RJ Hampton  Jonathan Isaac / Terrence Ross or Gary Harris (trade one?)  Chuma Okeke / maybe bring back Ennis?  Wendell Carter Jr / Mo Bamba
"I think they’re going to continue to take the development path until someone that moves the needle becomes available.  If the Minny pick converts, someone like Jalen Green would at the very least be a great spark off the bench."
"If its Jonathan kuminga, Jalen Green, someone like that , they'll be better than Lonzo by Year 2 for sure"

"Jalen green doesn’t have a ceiling, he has the ability to be the best player in the league in a matter of years. He has that it factor, he already is a top 5 athlete in the league, he put up lesser numbers to Cade because he was playing against ridiculous competition and had much better players around him, and still found a way to average 18 points on good shooting splits. Cade disappointed in March madness while in the one playoff game jalen played in he put up 30, 7, 5."
"We will end up winning too much, but if we got Cade and Jalen Green/Suggs this sub would break lol"
He won’t be on the team  It will be someone like Bazemore or if we are lucky Jalen Green/Suggs splitting that time with Klay early on
Warriors  Fade for Cade apparently  Then add Jalen Green with the 4th pick
Considering the Wolves already have a 40% chance at a top 3 pick . And considering the fact I dont consider Cade to be all that much better than someone like Jalen Green or Evan Mobley... not a whole lot
"Jalen Suggs will be the best player out of this draft.  His athleticism combined with his IQ and defensive ability will make him an instant impact player.  We will not need to wait for him to develop.  He's 6'4, is faster and more athletic than a lot of NBA guards.  His IQ is going to set him apart though.  Jalen green is a great prospect too but I think Suggs' game will have more of an overall impact to winning.  I could see Jalen Green averaging 20 on a bad team for 5 years."
That would be so funny. Lottery gods pls make that happen. Cade/curry/klay/Wiggins/draymond /jalen green/ oubre (if re-signed)
"He will yes. Also Jalen Green will be 2nd overall, not Mobley. Screenshot this"
Not gonna miss playoffs with Cade or Jalen Green. Those guys are franchise players.
"Better prospect would be Jalen Green. But I think it would really come down to who was picking at 2 or 3. A team like Minnesota might like the idea of Suggs more as they already have their superstar, and these two aren't far enough apart to justify the best pick available. A team like Detroit or Houston should probably take a gamble on Green."
Jalen green has higher ceiling so its him
"I’d take Suggs anyday, I don’t think that Jalen Green has “the It factor”"
"Jalen Green imo, his ceiling as a potential high volume scorer is the differentiator for me."
Magic w/ two top-10 picks this year? Jalen Green and Scottie Barnes maybe?
I feel like Jalen Green is way better
I was wondering why the magic would trade the Mavs just to get Josh green and then realized you probably meant Jalen Green.
You mean jalen josh green is on the mavs.
"The core is pretty clear, and I actually think we’re in a good spot rebuild wise. There was nothing we could do about having our two best young guys go out for the season, then have just about everyone else get injured as well.  A starting lineup of Fultz, Ross, Isaac, Okeke, WCJ/Bamba isn’t a world-beater, but it has tons of potential. That’s without considering two lottery picks this year, Cole Anthony, R.J Hampton, etc.  If we could get a lineup of Fultz, Jalen Green, Isaac, Okeke, WCJ, I really think we could make waves over the next few years. The main difficulty will be health in my eyes, not potential"
And Jalen Green
"Pistons with Saddiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart, Saben Lee, Killian Hayes, and one of Jalen Green/Jalen Suggs/Evan Mobley is a budding dynasty"
Jalen Green is the real pearl of the draft.

"Jalen Green. NBA-ready can hit 3s, would work as both a 2 and a 6man for them."
"I see everyone is sleeping on the Pistons.  Troy Weaver is assembling a gritty, hard-nosed team of Detroit-style youngsters who will all break out at the same time.  Isaiah Stewart, Saddiq Bey, Killian Hayes, Saben Lee, Hamadou Diallo, Sekou Doumboya, Jerami Grant, and a likely top 3 pick who could be Cade Cunningham, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, or Mobley."
"Kai can still make it but his handlers have to start making decisions based on improving his game and not making money off him.  That said, Tamayo of UP and Quiambao of La Salle are better than him.  If we go back, a 6'9 Alvin Patrimonio makes the NBA. A 7' Mon Fernandez makes the NBA. A 6'4 Samboy Lim makes the NBA. For that matter 6'4 Samboy Lim exists. His name is Jalen Green."
"Jalen Green.  Not really, but I think he’s going to take the league by storm as a rookie. Everyone talking Cade, and Green will be a big fucking deal in my opinion."
Jalen Green is gonna murk the dunk contest next season. Mark my words.
"team was 6-2 and had one the best record in the league with Fultz. Yes thats not many games but it looked very promising. We dont even have JI who is a premier defender in the league. We HAVE to flip Gordon and Evan together for something substantial.   We are actually in a great spot to get a top 3 pick which is either Cade Cunningham, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, or Evan Mobley. All 4 I think are gonna be good. Cades 99% going 1st so hypothetically lets say we get Suggs or Green to fill that SG spot our team looks like this  1. Fultz 2. Green/Suggs OR a guy that can be packaged with Gordon and Fournier. Oladipo again? 3. Okeke (Can put your top 3 pick here too if you move those guys for a SG..Either way the SG and SF could be interchangeable) 4. Isaac 5. Vooch  Bench: Cole, Bamba, Ross, Birch, Bacon  Thats a top 5 seed in the East"
"We have moved in that direction and are going to again in the draft. Our guards will be Fultz, Cole. Jalen Green / Jalen Suggs, and Ross. Thats a really solid backcourt"
"They've potentially got a 4-7th pick of the draft.  So it could be Steph, Klay, Wiggins, Draymond, Wiseman.  Potentially Jalen Green or Kuminga. Would they bring Oubre back?   Bench doesnt have the likes of Iguodala, Livingston, or Barbosa but the first 7 should be equivalent to the pre-KD Warriors, just more grizzled now."
"If they get Cade, Kuminga, or Jalen Green then yes... if not no"
"Cade, Suggs, Jalen Green, Kuminga, Mobley all look like studs. Those top 5 really shine.  I'm pretty high on a lot of other players in this draft too like the duo from Tennessee, Kispert (great shot and athleticism), Wagner (6'8 220 SG w/ a great shot), and Barnes (6'9 225 SF but raw)"
"With these new lotto odds I feel like you might as well try to win and hope to jump into the top 4 .    According to 538, you guys are projected to end up with the 7th worst record with the roster as-is,  that gives you a 32% chance at getting a top 4 pick.  I.e. Cade, Jalen green, Suggs, Kuminga or Evan Mobley   The incentive to bottom out isn't there anymore , you just need a little lottery luck"

"I kinda want OKC to bottom out simply so they can add high caliber talent to the roster so they can really compete later. Imagine Shai and Cade/Jalen green/Mobley, that’s a scary sight.   If Poku develops along with Maledon and Dort that’s a scary young team out west. They definitely need another high potential guy because talent just doesn’t sign with OKC. So please, start losing a bit more"
"I just wanna know whether T'Wolves are gonna keep a Top 3 pick or the Warriors about to get even more stacked next year with Klay back and one of Jalen Green, Jonathan Kuminga, or Jalen Suggs joining them."
"Lamelo for me, I feel like people are way more interested in him as a person than Zion. People only really check out Zion for highlights.   I could see Cade Cunningham/Jalen Green, or Emoni Bates/Chet Holmgren in a couple years also entering the conversation, they all have the talent+personality to do it imo. Kinda stretching the personality part with Cade, but he has the media push to make up for it."
"Because he's at his highest value right now and the magic with their core will not win a ring or even contend for one by the time he starts to regress (he's 30) so you have to consider getting the most value for him, young players, 2-3 1st round picks which can be used to move up in a draft, get complimentary players around a hopeful new star (cade, jalen green mobley etc)"
You gon see two Harden’s when they get Jalen Green
Rockets really Bout to have Kevin Porter and Jalen Green
KPJ + Wood + Top 5 pick this year is a pretty great young group. Tate and KMJ are pretty nice too. Suggs or Cade would be great on this team.    Off topic but does KPJ look exactly like Jalen Green to anyone else?
Yeah you just wait till it’s Jalen Green or someone else on the ignite lol
"Jalen green wouldn’t be a good fit on the warriors, he’s an elite scoring, and nothing else prospect. Kinda like young Zach lavine."
I'm sticking with James. I want Jalen green or kuminga anyways
"Cant wait for Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, and Jalen Johnson to all enter the league next season."
"We need to get rid of guys that just make our team slightly better. Vooch is a guy that makes your team A LOT better. I understand he might have the most value but there are different avenues to get a franchise guy without giving up one.  So with Gordon, Evan, and  Bamba, I'd be perfectly fine going out and getting picks or trying to get a guy like Lavine. Magic are just missing one franchise player to compliment the rest of the team and we need to acquire that through a big trade or picks.  Hypothetically if we could get a guy like Lavine with those 3 (and probably a future 1st/2nd) its even better if you can get Lavine with those guys AND tank for a top 3. Now hypothetically your starters are:  Fultz  Lavine  Cade/Jalen Green / Jalen Suggs (top 3 pick)  Johnathan Isaac  Vooch  With Okeke, Cole Anthony, Bacon, Birch, Ross and whoever else on the bench. Thats a very sneaky good squad"
"This is the difference between a team mentality and a franchise mentality. The team mentality says go out and win as many games as you can always, the franchise mentality says this isn’t about the 2020-21 season, or the next couple for that matter, its about the long-term health of the franchise.   The Inside guys seem to think the warriors have one more run in them, I don’t see it that way. With or without Klay Thompson, none of those guys who were part of the 2015-2019 teams are the same. They have two choices here  1. Mortgage the future of the franchise (Wiseman, T-Wolves pick, Wiggins) to try to bring in a player to help them win now against the likes of the Lakers, Nets, Sixers, and Bucks  2. Trade Steph and Klay for talented young players and picks, building the team around James Wiseman and possibly a Cade Cunningham or Jalen Green with an eye toward returning to the top of the top of the mountain in 3 years or so when the Nets and Lakers are no longer as dominant"
"And also hoping for the 4th pick to fall to them from Minnesota.      Jalen Green, Jonathan Kuminga, or Jalen Suggs come to the Bay."
"He went from overrated to underrated so quick. No he's not better than Jalen Green, people who said that after one game are dumb asf. But regardless he's a top 5 pick."
Kuminga stock has dropped significantly. Looks like the next Josh Jackson. Can’t shoot at all and just too weak to finish around NBA caliber bigs. He’s a tier below Jalen Green
Sure but I would still rather have Jalen green or kuminga with Weismann over lamelo personally  And if it doesn’t convey then unprotected in 2022 and the twolves will be bad that year too
 A healthy Jalen Green will win even if Zion competes.
"If you just dropped that guy into this years draft he’d probably go after Jalen Green lol   Jalen Green is younger, a better shooter, and played against pros. Same size, also a crazy athlete.   Jordan wasn’t the best NCAA player ever, unless his impact was just missed by metrics that weren’t available back then. He wouldn’t go above Cade or Green, would probably be in the convo with Suggs and Kuminga"
"Zach Lavine’s doppelgängers are coming out nowhere lol  Looks-wise? There’s Malachi Flynn.   Athleticism, play style, skills-wise? This kid Jalen Green."
"If they get no 4 then fuck, the wolves truly are cursed. They would get one of Suggs, kuminga, Mobley, Jalen green. All fantastic prospects"
"I was hyped to see our boy Kai Sotto signing for the Ignite. Then some shit happened where he was called up for the Philippine team, which caused him to miss out on the GLeague bubble and eventually cost his spot with the Ignite as well. (To add insult to injury, the FIBA qualifiers he was supposed to take part in were postponed lmao).  While we do have half-Filipino Jordan Clarkson as well as fellow half-Filipino Jalen Green, the ultimate dream is to have a homegrown Filipino in the NBA. I'm bummed af right now thinking about it."
Jalen Green would be ideal but in all reality the best available talent.
What’s the Pistons pick situation looking like? Do they even have a 2021 pick because Jalen Green would be great for yall aswell
Jalen Green for sure. They need a ball dominant true SG
"Cade is the most skilled and cerebral but Jalen Green to me is clearly the best athlete and most physically gifted. That dude is explosive, and he's a pretty skilled player as well."
I want the Pistons to get the number 1 pick. Cade would be a god send for them.   I want the Raptors to jump up and grab number 2. Evan Mobley seems like a seamless fit.   3 I want to be OKC and they grab Jalen Green.   After that idk
"Well, weird post but cool time to share my ideal Warriors team after the Off-Season.  Steph/Jessup (Or an appealing vet bench player)  Klay/Poole/Lee  Wiggins/Jalen Green/Bazmore  Draymond/JTA/Looney  Wiseman/Chriss  Summary-  Nico is on a 2 way, we SnT Oubre for Picks/TPE, that sort of stuff, Smiley is waived, Looney is moved to the 4 and so is JTA so Dray can be preserved and spacing is fixed, we get Chriss back, we trade Paschall for some 2nd rounder or something, not sure, maybe a part of a bigger trade, we get Jessup, we get the 4th pick from Minnie and draft Green OR package our pick and the Wolves pick for the 4th pick.  Since the moves aren't too drastic, you have a nice amount of assets to play with for any surprise FA or trade demands. Think that team can make a great run in the playoffs and is set up for the future."
Rockets got Tate / Kenyon Martin / KPJ in the second or underrated. Excellent job so for on the rebuild. I’m hoping they could get a top prospect in this years draft because a core of the dudes I just mentioned + C.Wood + a guy like Jalen Green. That’d be a fun team to watch
"Pistons fans are sooo in love with Jalen Green, a lot of us lowkey want him more than Cade (me included), so hopefully we manifest that shit man we get 0 lottery luck"
"Pistons fans are excited. For example if we draft Jalen Green our line up next year will probably be Hayes/Green/Bey/Grant/Stewart. That’s the best  young line up in the NBA, maybe in years. And it only took one season of tanking."
"I mean even swapping Wiggins and D’Lo was a huge win for us imo.  So getting anything in return is a huge W, let alone a top 10 pick.  I will say it sucks to see my Jalen Green dreams wash away, but hey, things could be worse."
So Mobley = Bosh and Melo = Jalen Green?
Jalen Green fits Detroit better than any other rookie. Detroit gets him it’s off to the races.
"Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, Cade Cunningham, Jonathan Kuminga, Evan Mobley.  Davion Mitchell, Keon Johnson, Jalen Johnson, Scottie Barnes, Isaiah Jackson.  Corey Kispert, James Bouknight, Kai Jones."
Jalen green is gonna destroy all of these
Steph as a ray allen on the heat type player to win the 2025 title as Wiseman and Jalen Green lead the Warriors to the title would be fun
I think Jalen Green would fit well in Detroit.
"Preparing for Cade Cunningham, Evan Mobley, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs or Jonathan Kuminga??"
Cade or Jalen Green 🤞🙏

"Thunder honestly planned this right. They had their worst season ever in a year where they didn’t have fans in their arena and the whole season was an adjustment for everyone.   Now they can go on to draft Cade or Jalen Green, and start being off to the races again."

Really hope we get 2 and take jalen green
"Man obviously I'd bite your hand off for Cade, but Jalen Green would slot into this lineup *so nicely*.  But I feel like Ash Ketchum in the first episode of Pokemon where he's going through the pros and cons of Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander then he just oversleeps and misses out on all three. Welcome to Detroit, Moses Moody. Hopefully Weaver can work his magic."
I would trade wiseman and bank on jalen green being a superstar if I had to pick between the two
"Luka and Timmy have been the most consistent guys on our team, but every other guy had a stretch of 2-3 weeks where he was a major contributor for winning.  Jalen Brunson in February was great, KP was great from February-March, Kleber was shooting extremly well for the first 3 months of the season.  Burke contributed to winning during the Covid crisis and is playing well since he got the chance against GSW.  For the last 15 games, DFS is probably the hottest and best 3&amp;D guy in the league, Powell is back to his old version and even WCS can give you 2 good games every week.  Shotout to the rookie Green, who was the reason for our comeback against Miami and lately has been our best defender coming from the bench."
"Basically look at Dwight Powell's 25-pt, 11/12 FGs game last month, then make it happen more often throughout the season. It would also add another playmaker option, so not having Luka on the floor doesn't mean you're just left with Jalen Brunson.  Can't have the same roster though as the pick used for Josh Green MUST convey to ATL instead."
"If we get Jalen Green I will be so happy, so that probably means that we won’t get him"
"OP might get clowned a little bit by some for using Luka as a example, but I agree in general. I don't have any real expertise regarding Jalen Green, but I am certain that the G-League is for sure a higher level than college basketball, so it is a fair point.   I would only add, that I feel a big difference to the european situation is the stakes, because those games before rabid fan bases against good, grown teams with often really good coaching are somewhat different from the G-League experience.  Nevertheless, those G-League rosters are filled with near NBA level players and most teams do have a few veterans and the bodies are bigger than on most college teams, so OP could turn out to be completely right on this one."
You can’t compare this situation. Nothing against the G-League and Jalen Green. But winning MVP in the 2nd strongest league in the world with 19 is on a another level and way more impressive. Also European Basketball is different and they Art very different prospects
"He is top 5, just jalen green is probably better"
Bj and Davion way too high there bud    Cade Cunningham   Evan Mobley   Jalen Green  Jalen Suggs   Jonathan Kuminga   Moses Moody   Keon Johnson   Jaden Springer  Jalen Johnson    Franz Wagner
"Jalen Green will prob fall to 3 and within a few weeks teams will be kicking themselves for not choosing him earlier; a la Jordan/Luka. His combination of elite skill + elite athleticism will make him a force in this league.   Mobley doesn’t look that great to me. Bamba was a much better defensive prospect in college, and due to his slender frame, is awful defensively in this league. Mobley is even *more* slender than Bamba and weighs less. Too risky of a top 2 pick imo."
"I hope not, hopefully jalen green, i’m just tired of centers lol"

And that's Magic bench backcourt. Their starter backcourt will be Fultz and Jalen Green 😬
"Cade/Jalen Green would be PERFECT but they're most likely gone if we don't get a top 3 pick. Mobley/Allen is an awkward fit, I personally think Kuminga still needs a couple years of development given his shooting %, and Suggs would be nice, but there's no way lineups with Garland/Sexton/Suggs at the 1-3 are anything but terrible defensively. Suggs is probably the guy I'd want if not for the first two guys I just mentioned, he'd basically get all the backup PG minutes when either of Sexland sits."
Idk why but I have this feeling that Jalen Green will be the best player coming out of this draft
And they’ve just entered Jalen Green contention
Here's a couple ok rosters  &amp;#x200B;  JM  PG - Ja Morant  SG - Jamaal Murray  SF - Jalen McDaniels  PF - Jaden McDaniels  C   - Javale McGee  &amp;#x200B;  DG  PG - Darius Garland  SF - Danny Green  SF - Danilo Galinari  PF - Draymond Green  C -  Daniel Gafford
Jalen green just signed with adidas. They winning. They got Trevor Lawrence first and now him
I'm very high on Jalen Green as well
"I don’t think anyone can predict this. It’ll have to be a super raw player with boatloads of potential &amp; an insane work ethic if it’s to be unexpected at this time.   With his potential, Jalen Green could make a run at MVP depending on his team &amp; personal success in 6-7 years. He’s got all the tools. I 100% see him winning a couple scoring titles in the future."
"KAT has the advantage of knowing when to kick out to the open man though, he’s superb at it. Grant just tries to barrel his way through 5 defenders on his own, he’s got to incorporate some more passing to his game, it’ll open everything up for him considerably. Hopefully we able to get someone in the draft that can compliment Grant, be a 1b to his 1a, like Jalen Green."
Jaylen Brown  Jalen Green  Coby White  Michael Redd  Tarik Black  Aaron Gray  Derek Rose  Hassan Whiteside  Cam Reddish  Red Robbins
Magic I need u guys to draft Jalen Green!
Tamayo and Quiambao from the NU team that beat the Jalen Green-led Fil-Am team.
"I bandwagonned during the championship years, but I stuck with being a fan last season as I believe in the Wiggins signing.  As a Filipino fan, will also probably be a fan of whoever drafts Jalen Green, whether he's a bust or not."
Detroit needs Jalen Green badly. Gotta pair a scoring guard with Killian because it's clear he's not a scorer and may never be one.
"Wait what? We WANT it to not land top 3 because the 4/5 picks are REALLY good this year.  And no, not every team has a package like Wiseman + Jalen Green or whatever the Minny pick could turn into."
"Klay, another full offseason to get a better bench, I can 100% see it. Especially if the Minny pick conveys and they have someone like Jalen Green off the bench.  Or if they trade all those assets for a Bradley Beal or something, I can absolutely see them being contenders"
"If the Minny pick converts, honestly I’d rather take a pick from this deep draft class. If we somehow end up with Jalen green, I will be ecstatic.  Trading for another star might kill the spacing when Klay gets back. It’s have to be for someone like Christian wood or Myles turner."
"If we end up with the Minny pick, then we can rectify the mistake pretty easily with a Jalen green, kuminga, or Suggs type player."
"Well luckily, if they don’t get cade, Jalen Green is the BPA."
"Jalen Green is a monster. His offensive skillset is larger than most NBA players let alone rookies. Think Bradley Beal with Zach Lavine athleticism. He’s 100% gonna win at least one scoring title, and his defence is very solid too. I really really hope we (Pistons) draft him.   Evan Mobley is also someone you should keep an eye on, he averaged nearly 4 blocks a game in college, his defensive presence &amp; IQ is off the charts. He’s also shown some playmaking, midrange, and three; along with posterizing dunk after posterizing dunk. A very very tall long defender that can make an impact right away.   Every single one of this year’s top 5 would go #1 last year, it’s a loaded class"
"Jalen Green didn't average 30 with the ignite, I think that's his postseason stats (1 gm vs the 905)"
"Magic should take Jalen Green if he’s there, he’s really a perfect fit."
uh they have Jalen Green listed at 30 points 5 rebs 7 asts lmao.
One of my favorite in game dunkers since Gerald Green.   Next up is Jalen Green in this year's draft class. That kid is winning at least 1 dunk comp.
He was an NBA prospect who just declared for the draft. It is just as relevant to the NBA as news about Jalen Green in the G-League is
"Just a rumor as of now barring an official announcement but tons of his friends and peers are tweeting about it... not sure if this qualifies to stay up, mods. Just thought I’d put it on here, but seems like too much substance to not be true. These random rumors don’t just happen typically.  This is fucking devastating.  [Jalen Green: “you gone too soon.”] (https://twitter.com/jalengreen/status/1385392169385545728?s=21)  [Shareef O’Neal: “Bro what😖... no way man”](https://twitter.com/ssjreef/status/1385391559554785281?s=21)"
I think Jalen Green can be a really good #1 option. You give him the ball and it's a bucket. I think Cade is a very high IQ player every possession but Jalen is just a freak. Tough call!
"Yezzir. I think Cole is gonna be their future 6th man. Brings a lot of energy and offense. The magic could really have a fantastic foundation for their rebuild if the lottery goes their way.  PG: Fultz/Cole/MCW  SG: Jalen Green/ Gary Harris /RJ Hampton  SF: Jonathan Isaac/ Ross/ Bacon  PF: Chuma/ Draft pick  C: WCJ/ Bamba  Obviously not even close to being a contender, but a really nice foundation for their rebuild."
"Jalen green on this team would be nasty.. but always tanking for draft position just isnt a good way to revive a franchise. It’s like the giants last ssn in the nfl: sure they had no shot at contending, but everyone was tired of being dogshit. It was time to make a push for the playoffs. They failed, but gave an admirable effort  Similarly, it’s time for the knicks to do something. No, they wont win the finals, but theyve been so bad for so many years, they just need to change the culture of the team with a playoff appearance"
Didn't Blatche show up to the last Gilas camp overweight? I'm hoping Jalen Green can make that team but idk how that'd work if he already played u18 for team usa.
"All those years of Marv Albert calling Jaylen Brown “Jaylen Green” by confusing him with Jeff Green, and now there’s gonna be an actual Jalen Green"
"I agree with you that this year Minnesota's  had some really shit luck that's no one can be blamed for but I think he was asking about the 6 years that Kats been in the league and if I remember there was some unforeseeable injuries and bad luck. But at some point you have to ask is it the players or the coaching or maybe the front office. Sometimes it is systemic and is all of the above and it's just a poorly run franchise.  If I'm a timberwolves fan I'm praying to the lottery god's to give them ping pong balls in the top three because this is a pretty good draft and I think there's a real chance of getting Cade Cunningham, Evan mobley, Jalen suggs, or Jalen Green. And I really do think that any one of those guys on that Timberwolves roster would be a pretty good team. And if it's not a top three pick it's going to Golden State"
Indeed he needs to develop physicality. If Jalen Green and random Filipino high schoolers can dunk on him he should expect the same in the NBA and be able to respond accordingly.
Tamayo and Quiambao from the NU team that beat the Jalen Green-led FilAm team are better than him.
Pistons would not take Mobley at 2. Would bet big money on them taking Jalen Green or Suggs at two. They still have a guard problem (SG especially) and aren't as worried about taking a C with Plumlee and Stew locked up.
"Lots of flawed arguments being thrown around in this thread by OP  1. Comparing the draft placements of Jalen Green and Jalen Suggs is dumb for two reasons. First, the draft hasn't happened and claiming that one player is going to for sure go before the other is just wrong, no matter how you feel about the two prospects. Second, coming out of high school they weren't on the same tier as prospects. From the 247 Composite, Jalen Green was a 0.9998 rated prospect and Suggs was a 0.9968 rated prospect. That may not seem like that big a difference but Green is tied for the 6th highest rated recruit from 2016 to 2020 whereas Suggs wasn't even top 10 in his own class  2. There's no proven track record of either of those leagues producing lottery picks, I think Lamelo's the only one ever. This point should require no further explanation.  3. ""Im not sure why these athletes keep going to college when the G-League and NBL are here."" Because it wasn't all that obvious what the G-League Ignite team would even be and the NBL is thousands of miles away from where most of these prospects live?"
"Depends.  Trading Wiseman + 4th pick and whatever assets to make it work (Wiggins, maybe GS pick?) yeah that could be bad, because Jalen Green is a great prospect in his own right.  But if the pick is 5th or doesn’t convey, I could see it being a great trade. Beal fits the Kerr offense like a glove with his off-ball prowess, and he was actually an above average defender in the Wall days (prior to being asked to carry an entire offense)."

"If Paul Reed, Jalen Green, KPJ, Trevelin Queen, and Cam Reynolds were on a team they would have a good chance of doing well"
"[He looks way more than 5%, just saying. ](https://gossipgist.com/uploads/28605/jalen-green-biography.png)"
Jalen Green probably has the highest ceiling right now among Filipinos
Jalen Green compared to Clarkson has a brighter career in their pre-NBA or non-pro career however he needs to find his way to keep up the expectation. A lot of NBA players already put up their expectation on him. While Clarkson was nobody and did everything from zero  to be what he's now. I'm really keen to see what will be his career in NBA although he really need to put a lot of effort for his  G-League career first.
Jalen Green like everyone’s saying but he has an extremely minuscule amount of Filipino blood. His moms grandfather was Filipino so he’s like probably like 5% Filipino only.
Technically Jalen green is one since his mom is filipina.   Kobe paras had a chance with his physical talents but it seemed he didn't take it too seriously when he went to the us.  Kai Sotto too. It seems his team just keeps on making bad decisions on how he should develop though
Jalen Green? He’s half. A shame Kobe Paras flamed out of college. Kai Sotto I don’t know will be in the league.
"1. We desperately need a go-to scorer/franchise player type, preferably someone who can play 2/3. It's almost impossible to trade for someone like that as a rebuilding team, so hopefully we can draft Cade/Green/Suggs (in that order).  2. We need a backup forward, ideally one that can shoot and defend. We have the Bulls pick which is looking like it will be somewhere between 5-10. I like Moses Moody here, but wouldn't be too upset with Keon Johnson, Jalen Johnson, James Bouknight or Scottie Barnes (also in that order). A lot of those guys are more 2/3s but we suck so BPA is more important anyways.  I doubt we will make any major signings, but I could see us trade away TRoss at draft time possibly to move up."
"Exactly. Jalen Green or Cacok? Like come on. Dont forget when MJ was a rookie before start of season? , experts were already saying he's the GOAT"
"Send Beal to the Warriors for Beal 2.0 in Jalen Green, Wiseman, and Wiggins."
Cade then Jalen green
Magic -  i want jalen green so bad.
"If we get a Top 4 pick, I'd be ecstatic with any of the top 5 players in this draft (Cade/Mobley/Suggs/Green/Kuminga).  If we end up more in the 6-10 range, I like Scottie Barnes, Keon Johnson, Moses Moody or even Jalen Johnson.  I like Kai Jones and Usman Garuba as projects, but I'd only take them if we're trading down into the 11-20 range."
"You articulated exactly what I was trying to say. I'm like 6'4 and have pretty good vert and my head would be above the rim easy on a 9 fight rim, honestly most semi athletic tall people's would be near it. Jalen Green is taller than me, his wingspan is way longer, and he probably jumps like a foot higher.  There's no way he would be that low to the rim on a dunk that requires his max hang time if the hoop was 9 feet. He would just be way above the rim."
I'm tryna see Jalen Green and Jordan Clarkson play together on the Philippines national team 👀🤤

"i’m high on Jalen Green but this is cap. If that was true, he would be scoring 30+ right out the gate like what Beal is doing or scoring 28 on crazy efficiency which is what Lavine was doing pre COVID."
"Honestly I want the raptors to draft jalen green if the raptors jump in the lottery to a top four pick. I know Mobley may fit better, Cade goes number one, but imagine the Filipinos in Toronto find out about his heritage, they’ll celebrate him as their own! Also because I believe in jalen green potential"
"Best scorer: Jalen Green  Best playmaker: Cade, Suggs and Cooper  Best defender: Garuba"
"Yo you know, Jalen Green coming into the league next year has a chance to be the next Vince/Tmac. Watch some tape if you can, hes basically a high schooler with more athleticism than the majority of the NBA. And he’s actually able to combine his athleticism &amp; quickness with insanely high level skill. This kid does Kobe / MJ levels of body adjustments in the air, his offensive arsenal is outstanding for an 18 year old, it’s already bigger than most scorers in the league. I truly believe he’s the next Vince."
"People are giving a shit about the guys on team ignite tho, at least a little bit. And the program is still in its infancy. If going to college was that much better jalen green and kuminga wouldn’t have chosen the g league. Imagine if they got a real celebrity prospect like mikey williams or bronny?"
"&gt;Plus another off season of wiseman learning the defensive ropes from green (and some injury luck) it's a pretty nice 5 on paper. Probably need a spark off the bench though cos when curry sits its.... not great.  Definitely agree. I've maintained that the biggest addition we need is a Vet PG that can shoot and playmake, we can do smaller signings for our other spots, but if we're getting a bigger name, a great Vet PG is more reasonable than Giannis. A Vet PG with Poole and say, Kelly Olynk and Chriss (2 reasonable signings) and we package our picks for the 4th to get Jalen Green. Then fill out the remaining spots with guys who can shoot in a pinch. I'm not askin for a superstar, just some good roleplayers."
"Relegate to catch and shooting? Did you want Luka to put the ball in Josh Richardson's hands - the same Josh Richardson who had more turnovers than assists? Or what about noted turnover machine Dorian Finney Smith, who can barely dribble at an NBA level? Or maybe he should've let one of our 6 bigs handle the ball and playmake? Or what about Timmy, the guy who will either only shoot or drive for a layup? Maybe Jalen Brunson, who was shut down in the playoffs? That just leaves noted DNP Trey Burke and rookie Josh Green as the last 2 players in our regular season rotation - should we rely on them? LeBron in 2018 was incredible but to say that he could get this team to be more than spot up shooters is asking for a miracle."
Yuta Watanabe of Toronto. Next draft we're gonna have another half Filipino in Jalen Green and probably Kai Sotto next. I don't really know anyone else.
"Do you think Jalen Green ever suit up for Philippines’ national team like Clarkson does? I don’t know how good Kai Sotto is gonna be but Sotto, Green and Clarkson on a same team would be very fun to watch."
"Youth team appearances doesn't matter, they're more focused on the passport.  FIBA started limiting the naturalized players because Qatar just basically naturalized 10 African players for their national team, and putting a ""they played for another country's youth team"" limit won't put a stop on what Qatar did anyway, so they didn't do that.  What I don't know is if Jalen Green has a Philippine passport already before turning 16 or not"
"WTH? Jalen Green too?   I wonder which team will rule Asian Basketball. Clarkson himself couldn't beat Team China with its legion of 7 footers and 6'8 forwards, but with Jalen Green, who knows?  Then there is Team Japan with Yuta and Kawaii Leonard. Olympic qualifying matches would be wild."
Yup Jordan Clarkson and Jalen Green next season will be the Filipinos of the NBA
"A Vet PG, good shooters to fill out the bench, Wiseman developed, a good backup 5 like Chriss again and drafting Jalen Green."
"This season devolved for a myriad of reasons and I think this trade was part of it, but I think the Mavs overachieved last year to even make the playoffs and didn't get heaps better so it makes sense to me that they made the playoffs and saw an early exit. I believe my prediction to myself (and thus, my season expectation/hope) at the beginning of the season was a 6-seed and a first round exit, so they even outperformed that. Contextually, the only team above the Mavs in the West from last season that got visibly worse (to me) from last year were the Rockets (by a lot), Thunder (by a lot), and Clippers (by not so much and in fact this Clippers iteration may be more successful, who knows, NBA is weird) whereas teams like the Nuggets, Jazz, Nuggets and Suns got objectively better/healthier.  Mavs didn't do very much to make a leap. It always felt like this was the last season of experimentation to me. Try some lineup/player type combinations and see what sticks. I think we learned a lot. DFS took a huge leap in the 2nd half of the season (but didn't really bring it consistently to the playoffs), it's unclear whether Maxi is finally regressing or just too beaten up to be usable, KP is probably not the second star/unicorn they wanted him to be due to injury or mental stuff, but more visibly, we carried 4 nearly unplayable rookies (I like Josh Green and want to see him develop, but I don't believe he's currently an NBA player) a super narrow Boban, and a Trey Burke all season. You just can't have 5-6 guys on an NBA roster who see  next to no minutes other than garbage time and expect to be a deep playoff contender, y'know? That's possibly a roster management issue and I think Donnie's seat is a little hot (and should be), but mostly it says to me that this team was not constructed with the goal of competing for a title and I think that's fine, not every team should be so long as there's a plan for the future (which I do think there is!).  I always believed that the roadmap looked something like this: Year 1 of Luka was just play with Dirk, have some fun, adjust to the speed of the NBA, get the torch passed, etc. Year 2 was letting Luka be the guy for better or for worse, put the offense in the hands of a kid who can't drink in the US yet and see what you have. Maybe get him a potential partner/2nd option if the deal is right and experiment with that. Probably won't make the playoffs, that's fine, who cares. Start collecting some expirings for the next season or two and point towards a FA year that you think could end up strong. Year 3 is the low playoff seed year (unless you use the offseason pre-Y3 to get a big splashy FA, Dallas didn't) and get some experience under the brightest lights. Year 4 is probably the FA target year. You get 1 more season before Luka's superduperubermax prevents you from affording much and requires strong drafting/scouting, so use it wisely. This FA class could've had Giannis (someone Donnie had been vocal about wanting to draft, but Cuban shut down because he wanted cap space for one last title run with Dirk), could still have Kawhi, Jrue Holiday, Oladipo, etc., that's a pretty reasonable FA class to target in on 2-3 years out. Year 4 would be the opening of the window and for as long as you have Luka + 2nd star, you'll be a top 4 seed in the West (provided no injuries or whatever)   I think the biggest deal people don't realize or sweep under the rug with Seth is that he has some red flags. He's nearly 31, wanted starter minutes (Philly did give him nearly 29 MPG this season compared to Dallas' 24.6 last year, which is effectively what Brunson played this year (25)), but has historically been a pretty underwhelming defender in addition to being a low volume shooter. He only averages about 5 3s attempted per game. He's a flashy scorer (and is a Curry) but he takes pretty ""safe"" shots. We have no idea what he looks like with a higher volume if he say, took THJ amounts of shots, because he's just never really done it for a whole season. His line looks a lot like Jalen and I think we'd just much rather have Jalen who is 6 years younger than Curry and still able to develop.  I also digress. Ultimately, I'm sad right now/today/this week, but I think the truth is the Mavs performed as-expected/as-hoped. There were a lot of downs this season (for us AND everyone else, COVID sucks) but some ups too. This offseason is going to impact the future of this franchise likely more than any offseason outside of 2019 and I have no reason to not be optimistic and will continue to be optimistic until proven otherwise and if that happens, we'll go from there I guess."

I initially mis-read your comment as just player they had drafted. It seems like a weird thing to criticize DAL over as they had just drafted those players before ATL did. Meaning they had been on rookie scale contracts but they just expired.   Luka Doncic  Josh Green  Tyrell Terry  Jalen Brunson  and then DFS is making 4 mil a year for the next 3 years or so
"&gt; The Hawks have six players they drafted on rookie scale contracts **while the Mavs only have three**.  Dorian Finney-Smith  Dwight Powell  Jalen Brunson  Maxi Kleber  Tyrell Terry  Josh Green  Luka Doncic  lol that's half of their roster. And that's not even considering they traded for 3 more players bird rights (Richardson, Porzingis &amp; Hardaway JR)."
"I hate this kind of shit.   First, we've no clue why LeBron was asking to come out of the game.   He could have been hurt.   He could have been completely exhausted and unable to play to his best.   We saw plays where he didn't make it down to the end of the court.   Maybe that was him giving up on a play; maybe it was him simply being exhausted.   The dude is 36 years old.  You know what else Jalen never saw Michael do? Play in the playoffs after the age of 34.   He also never saw Michael win a FMVP award at the age of 35.   So yeah, we are starting to see that LeBron is human. The only remotely comparable player is Kareem, and by this age, Kareem was not longer being asked to be the team leader in any category.  Magic handled the passing. Worthy handled the scoring. Green handled the rebounding.   Kareem just complemented the guys around him and forced defenses to stay on him to spread the floor.   LeBron has to do ALL of those things.   Expecting a 36-year-old to carry a team? In the playoffs? Against the team with the second best record in the league? With the team's best player (and AD is very likely the Lakers' best player at this point) out of the game.   That's a lot to ask.   Was LeBron exhausted? No doubt.   He played 41 minutes. AT THE AGE OF 36!!!!!!  He lead his team in points.   In rebounds.   In assists.   In steals.  In blocks.  So Jalen can SHUT THE FUCK UP.  LeBron did about all he could do in that game.   And it still isn't enough for people.   They want 48 minutes from a 36 year old?   And then put him down because ""Jordan never did that?""  No. Jordan never led his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, and minutes at the age of 36 in an elimination game.   JORDAN NEVER DID THAT.   So thanks for your horse shit perspective Jalen."
Definitely   Jalen Green is such a Warriors pick   I think he has the highest ceiling in the draft.
"Warriors get 4), draft Jalen Green.   Book it."
...I’m confused why you’d have to choose between the two? Jalen Green will be in this year’s draft and Bronny is 16
That's cool with me I'd rather have jalen green instead just saying lol
"Super low on Jaren Jackson, kind of low on Kai Jones  Super high on Jalen Green"
I'd rather have jalen green than Bronny thank you very much!
I really want my team to package the 6th and 14th for Jalen Green if we don't get the 4th pick.
"Zion is such a uniquely gifted player, as insane as Ja is, insanely athletic PGs come around a lot more than whatever the hell type of freak Zion is. Hell, Jalen Green looks like he can be a huge star this year and you can get him outside of the top 3"
* MVP - Stephen Curry (GSW) * 6MOY - Derrick Rose (NYK) * DPOY - Jimmy Butler (GSW) * MIP - Lauri Markannen (DAL) * COY - Rick Carlisle (DAL) * ROTY - Jalen Green (TOR)
* MVP: Luka Doncic * 6MOY: Jalen Brunson * DPOY: Kristaps Porzingis * MIP: Josh Green * COY: Rick Carlisle * Finals MVP: Boban Marjanovic
"Wiggins, though I think he’s more of a SF. Jalen Green is probably up next, would be the #1 overall in last years draft for sure."
When they get Cade or Jalen green they will be infinitely more relevant than the heat will be while the heat cap out as a first round exit
"I doubt Jalen Green is gonna even be an all-star, let alone the most famous player in the league at some point. Luka is the best bet just because he's probably the only current young player who can reach that GOAT discussion (unlikely for any player at all but he's the best bet)"
I’m taking Jalen green or Jalen Suggs any day over grant. No way we pass on that potential if we get a top 4 pick.
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ_wQuK7udY  Keon might be the most athletic SG in the draft not named Jalen Green and the best defensive guard. He doesnt have the college production, but he was in a crowded backcourt, the team didn't have a real playmaker (Springer is gonna be a 2 in the NBA), and he didnt shoot well on a low sample size. Regardless, solid handle and extremely good dribble penetration inside (shot almost 60% at the rim.) His box score numbers look worse than his actual, but one of those guys where eye test numbers beats the production. Super high ceiling imo."
Mock Draft [Week #23](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/neflvx/mock_draft_monday_game_thread_index/gyfy2ya/) - Lottery simmed on tankathon - first one after end of regular season  1) Toronto (+6) - Cade Cunningham - PG - OK St  2) Oklahoma City (+3) - Evan Mobley - C - USC  3) Orlando - Jalen Green - SG - G-League  4) Sacramento (+6) - Jalen Suggs - G - Gonzaga  5) Oklahoma City (from HOU) (-4) - Jon Kuminga - F - G-League  6) Detroit (-4) - Keon Johnson - SG - Tenn  7) Cleveland (-3) - Scottie Barnes - PF - FSU  8) Golden State (from MIN) - Moses Moody - G/F - Arkansas  9) New Orleans - James Bouknight - SG - Uconn  10) Orlando (from CHI) - Jalen Johnson - F - Duke  11) Charlotte - Alperen Sengun - C - Turkey  12) San Antonio - Franz Wanger - F - Michigan  13) Indiana - Jaden Springer - G - Tenn  14) Golden State - Davion Mitchell - G - Baylor  15) Washington - Jared Butler - G - Baylor  16) Boston - Kai Jones - PF/C - Texas  17) Memphis - Ziaire Williams - F - Stanford  18) Houston (from MIA) - Josh Giddey - PG - Australia  19) New York - Isaiah Jackson - C - Kentucky  20) Atlanta - Ayo Dosunmu - G - Illinois  21) New York (from DAL) - Cam Thomas - SG - LSU  22) Houston (from POR) - Greg Brown - PF - Texas  23) LA Lakers - Sharife Cooper - PG - Auburn  24) Houston (from MIL) - Chris Duarte - G/F - Oregon  25) LA Clippers - Tre Mann - PG - Florida  26) Denver - Usman Garuba - PF/C - Spain  27) Brooklyn - Daishen Nix - PG - G-League  28) Philadelphia - Day'Ron Sharpe - C - UNC  29) Phoenix - Trey Murphy - SG/SF - Virginia  30) Utah - BJ Boston - G/F - Kentucky
"I personally think Suggs is going to translate to the best NBA ready player . He’s got intangible things you can’t  teach , he makes the guys around him better when he’s on the court . Top 5 for me goes Cade , Suggs , Mobley , Kuminga , Green with Jalen Johnson or Moody Moses being the 6th"
"If you had to pick keeping Jalen green or wiseman it’s easily green.  Modern bigs are more hype than good  There’s a fine line between Bagley, JJJ, Ayton , and embiid/Kat"
You take Jalen Green 100% unless someone like Beal becomes an option.  Green + Poole off the bench with Klay back literally fixes all of our offensive issues
"Sometimes the spring pad is more valuable than the 1 million. Theres risk and opportunity costs.  For example you've got Jalen green who says he could've gone first if he went to college instead of g league, if that were true going to g-league while making him 1 million actually ended up costing him 4 million in rookie contract money."
"Obviously in an nba sub college basketball is generally looked down upon because it's not as good a product but I'm a huge nba junkie and I've watched 1 g league game all year (Jeremy Lin vs Ignite). I've watched U of I basketball about 20 times. Even if Jalen is definitely better than Ayo, Ayo to me has a bigger profile to me. I think it works for some college basketball players. Zion for example wasn't the top recruit, that was Barrett. But Zion pretty much confirmed his top pick status 1 month into the Duke season. Who knows, maybe is Jalen Green dominated in college as a freshman, he'd be in the top pick conversation right now with the added exposure"
"Yes, and I'm high on Jalen Green, but that's probably not true. I'd say Cade and Mobley are often mocked higher than him because of their positional archetypes (Tall PG and Versatile Big vs. Traditional scoring guard). Besides that tweet, Green has always been praising the G-League, even convincing Jaden Hardy to join."
Didn't Jalen Green or someone from the Ignite team claim he'd be first pick if he went to college?
"If they don’t get the #1 pick they should draft Jalen Green, KPJ can play PG"
watch jared butler be the steal of the draft and jalen green be the best player from this draft i'm calling it
It would be insanely great for Orlando if they managed to walk out with Jalen Green &amp; James Bouknight.
If they miss the playoffs I'd love it if they leapt OKC in the lottery and got to get like Jalen Green or Kuminga.
I think they’d almost have to go Jalen Green at 2 if they’re making this type of commitment to Allen. Maybe Green can the 3? Idk...they gotta make some choices soon.
I would pick jalen green and trade sexton ASAP
I’d still trade back for Jalen green.  Dudes being slept on so hard and I don’t get it. His floor is jaylen brown.
"They already have Wiseman.  Honestly, the Warriors did the righ thing tanking in 2019-2020 and trading D'Lo for Wiggins and the T'Wolves draft pick. They will likely get another highnpick in this deep 2021 draft class.  A Jalen Suggs or Jalen Green or Jonathan Kuminga or Scottie Barnes."
"Steph, Klay, Dray, JTA, Looney, Wiggins, Wiseman, Poole.  If we get Jalen Green before the expansion (Or Suggs), then I'm moving off JTA for him. I'd assume an expansion team wouldn't take him and he's the safest choice, but I'd of course keep him."
All the Kevin Nguyens and Stephen Li's and Andrew Kim's are all gonna see Jalen Green and Jordan Clarkson and finally feel represented at the professional basketball level that somebody who looks like them was able to make it. A monumental moment for the system to finally see Asian folks as athletic and capable.. this is truly what representation is about..
Jalen Green
Jalen Green is getting drafted this year
Jalen Green to the dubs - Filipino Heritage Month spoke person shit will print it’s own money.
1. Luka   2. KP   3. Jalen Brunson   4. Tim Hardaway Jr.   5. Dorian Finney-Smith   6. Maxi Kleber   7. Dwight Powell  8. Josh Green
"Mock Draft [Week #22](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/n93uxd/mock_draft_monday_game_thread_index/gxlw0cg/) - Lottery simmed on tankathon based on current record, and flipped a coin for play-in games (I obviously don't expect these teams to all be lottery teams, the exercise is to track the changes week by week as records change)  1) Houston - Cade Cunningham - PG - OK St  2) Orlando (+1) - Jalen Green - SG - G-League  3) Oklahoma City (+2) - Evan Mobley - C - USC  4) New Orleans (+4) - Jalen Suggs - G - Gonzaga  5) Detroit (-3) - Jon Kuminga - F - G-League  6) Cleveland (-2) - Scottie Barnes - F - FSU  7) Golden State (from MIN) (-1) - Keon Johnson - SG - Tenn  8) Toronto - Moses Moody - G/F - Arkansas  9) Sacramento - Jalen Johnson - F - Duke  10) Orlando (from CHI) - Corey Kispert - SF - Gonzaga  11) Charlotte - Alperen Sengun - C - Turkey  12) San Antonio - Franz Wagner - F - Michigan  13) Indiana - Davion Mitchell - G - Baylor  14) Memphis - James Bouknight - SG - UConn  15) Washington - Jared Butler - G - Baylor  16) Boston - Kai Jones - PF/C - Texas  17) Golden State - Josh Giddey - PG - Australia  18) Oklahoma City (from MIA) - Ziaire Williams - SF - Stanford  19) New York - Jaden Springer - G - Tenn  20) Atlanta - Cam Thomas - SG - LSU  21) New York (from DAL) - Isaiah Jackson - C - Kentucky  22) Houston (from POR) - Greg Brown - PF - Texas  23) LA Lakers - Usman Garuba - PF/C - Spain  24) Houston (from MIL) - Chris Duarte - G/F - Oregon  25) LA Clippers - Tre Mann - PG - G-League  26) Denver - BJ Boston - G/F - Kentucky  27) Brooklyn - Ayo Dosunmu - G - Illinois  28) Philadelphia - Day'Ron Sharpe - C -  UNC  29) Phoenix - Sharife Cooper - PG - Auburn  30) Utah - Daishen Nix - PG - G-League"
"Cade would be the dream, but realistically I want Jalen Suggs or Green. We also have the bulls pick, which is top three protected. We have to go best player available with that one. Other than that I want some veteran forward depth, some shooting, and JI and Kelle to be fully recovered and ready for next season. Hopefully we can be competitive next year, but we need much better injury luck."
Also if they can get Jalen Green or Kuminga.
"only 2 of the ignite players from this year are projected first round, and Jalen Green was already talking about how he would have been projected higher if he went to college, and he was their best player. Also sources say he only made around 250k, while falling from first to third in the draft is several million dollars difference."
"Sign Kawhi, pick Jalen Green with the 4th pick, Wiseman recovers quickly and trains with KG, Klay comes back before the season and is his old self, sign vets who expect the team to be a contender to fill out the bench."
"From what I understand, the bulls are taking jalen green at 2"
The Bulls are definitely taking Jalen Green at 2.
The bulls are lasered in on Jalen green with the second pick.
Nah he think the bulls are taking jalen green at 2
The bulls are acquiring jalen green with the 2nd overall draft pick
Man somethin telling me the bulls are taking jalen green at 2
Do you think jalen green would be redundant paired with Lavine?
Don’t worry buddy I’ll join you. The Bulls are taking Jalen Green at 2.
😂my phone froze up and I just spammed the post button. Oh well. Maybe I can speak it into existence if I say it more.  The bulls are taking jalen green at 2
Nah the bulls are taking jalen green at 2
Nah the bulls are getting Jalen Green at 2
Nah the bulls are taking jalen green at 2
Depends on who we draft in the top 5. If we get cade suggs Mobley or kuminga I would love to pair moody or bouknight with them. With jalen green pairing scottie barnes with him would be cool or maybe a shooter like krispert.
"Throwing nice passes is different from being able to dominate while running an offense, though.  Like lets say Green in his prime averages 30/5/5 .. how does that make him a dominant playmaker? James Harden, Luka Doncic score 30+ while also averaging 9-10 assists and controlling the entire offense - thats the difference between a bonafide superstar and the type of player you're describing ..who'd be a very good max player but not an MVP you can build a title team around.  I've watched his Ignite games as well and I'm curious to know where you are seeing something different from myself and most others. [This scouting report sums it up well](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/3/9/22320551/jalen-green-nba-draft-ignite-g-league).. he isn't an unwilling passer but his playmaking skills aren't categorized as elite or anything:  &gt;Green is not much of a playmaker, averaging 2.8 assists per game on 2.7 turnovers. He mostly hunts for his own shot when he’s on the floor. The times when he does pass often seem predetermined.  ...  &gt;The problem for the NBA team that drafts Green is that he is nowhere near ready to run an offense, and a player with his limited passing chops has to play off the ball. That will be a challenging adjustment given that he’s always been a ball-dominant guard."
"Hoo boy. Noone in Detroit is accepting that offer bud (2, 23+24). I know yall have talked yourselves into Jalen Green being great but Houston would be all over that offer and theres no way Detroit is taking that. I assure you it's not coming out of Detroit sports writers"
We only started hating and trolling on you guys since your fanbase started infiltrating our sub and BR community trying to say John Wall and Jalen Green would be enough to get Cade. Hell nah fam.
"Wouldn’t say they have “0 talent” Kevin Porter Jr., Christian Wood, and JaeSean Tate all seem like hoopers. That’ll be a good core around Jalen Green or whoever Houston picks"
"it says  &gt;Might be weirdly worded, but I would rather my team have the 2021 second overall pick than to have the 2020 first overall pick, **even with the knowledge we have on the players having played a year in the NBA.** If I were a GM and i was offered any 2020 rookie or a chance to draft Green/Mobley, I would take the latter. Maybe i’m dumb, but Jalen Green is more enticing than Lamelo or Anthony Edwards in my eyes. What do you guys think ?"
It’s working out fine because Jalen Green seems to want to be in Houston
"Apparently there was a game between Jalen Green and Marcus Bagley where Bagley outplayed green:  https://247sports.com/college/arizona-state/Article/ASU-basketball-commitment-Marcus-Bagley-Marcus-Bagley-III-Bobby-Hurley-134021520/  Maybe his Dad is angling for Green to go number 1 and that way he can position Marcus to be better than the #1 pick. I could see Lavar Ball doing something like that, so why not Bagley Sr?"
"Jalen Green is gonna be a star. Moreso if the Raptors got him. If Rockets got him tho, idk.   Josh Giddey will be the one picked at 10 or later who will take a run at that ROTY. He might be picked earlier tho, I won't be surprised if any team took him at top 5.   Cade Cunningham will be targeted by NBA's elite perimeter defenders. I think it will be like the Lonzo trajectory with awful early season but decent to great later on.   Mobley will get eaten inside."
Why would Bagley's dad love Jalen Green? Do they have some connection?
Gotta give him props for his delusions  The man is dead set on Jalen Green going #1 somehow lmaooo
Yeah why would he be so hype about Jalen Green
Kuminga does not have a Cade-level ceiling. You’re vastly overestimating him if you think that’s reality. He might have Jalen Green type potential but that would be absolute best case scenario and we rarely see players reach their absolute ceiling.
No 1 Detroit Pistons - Cade Cunningham  No 2 Houston Rockets - Jalen Green  No 3 Cleveland Cavaliers - Evan Mobley  No 4 Toronto Raptors - Jalen Suggs  No 5 Orlando Magic - Jonathan Kuminga  No 6 Oklahoma City Thunder - Scottie Barnes  No 7 Golden States Warriors -  Moses Moody  No 8 Orlando Magic - James Bouknight  No 9 Sacramento Kings - Franz Wagner  No 10 New Orlean Pelicans - Cory Kispert  No 11 Charlotte Hornets - Usman Garuba  No 12 San Antonio Spurs - Alperen Sengun  No 13 Indiana Pacers - Josh Giddey  No 14 Golden States Warriors - Jalen Johnson  No 15 Washington Wizards - Ziaire Williams  No 16 Oklahoma Thunder - Kai Jones  No 17 Memphis Grizzlies - Keon Johnson  No 18 Oklahoma Thunder - Jaden Springer  No 19 New York Knicks - Davion Mitchell  No 20 Atlanta Hawks - Jared Butler  No 21 New York Knicks - Chris Duarte  No 22 Los Angeles Lakers - Tre Mann  No 23 Houston Rockets - Trey Murphy III  No 24 Houston Rockets - JT Thor  No 25 Los Angeles Clippers - Sharife Cooper  No 26 Denver Nuggets - Ayo Dosumno  No 27 Brooklyn Nets - Isaiah Jackson  No 28 Philadelphia 76ers - Cam Thomas  No 29 Phoenix Suns - Josh Christopher  No 30 Utah Jazz - Quentin Grimes  Thoughts?
"Jalen Green will disappoint for his draft slot, and he and Kuminga will set back the entire concept of the G League as a stepping stone for 18 year olds.  Evan Mobley will end up the best player in this draft."
"Giddey and Moody are being significantly underrated as prospects  Cade will get pigeonholed into a full time point-forward role for years before teams realize that isn't what he is  Jalen Green is the best prospect of the draft IMO  Kuminga probably will not be a good NBA player  Evan Mobley is not a power forward and if a team tries to play him at PF they're gonna look really stupid  I think it's fairly likely we see Detroit trade down to #2 with Houston  &gt; The Thunder will trade up into the top 4  Unless a team really likes Kuminga or something, I think it's incredibly unlikely we see anyone trading out of the top 4"
"If rockets get Jalen Green, then Rockets."
"KPJ, Jalen Green or Mobley, Wood, Tate, KJ Martin 🚀 We can only go up from here."
Jalen Green &gt; Chris Paul change my mind
"Rockets are in a position to have kpj, Jalen green, and James wiseman if warriors trade him for wood"
"Thats why they're training outside the PH now.   Kai was with Ignite in the G-League (together with Jalen Green) and he's gonna play for the NBL in Australia this season. Lebron Lopez just signed with Overtime Elite (another alternative league to the G-League). And Kobe Paras signed with East West Private, the same team that manages Kai. We'll see if he gets a deal to play in some foreign league too.  These are the right moves if they want to get into the NBA. Even Yuta and Rui played college ball in the US and didnt stay in Japan. So we'll see."
I can tell you've never watched Jalen Green in your life. He's actually a average to above average man on man defender. And Devin Booker made the finals at 24 and scored 70 points in a game. I wouldn't judge him yet.
I think that calling CP3 top 5 in mvp voting makes it look worse then it is. Also d book not winning a ring doesn’t mean that a scoring guard like Jalen green can’t win. Not like d book is the best scoring guard and green could be better
"I dont know about ""consistently"". Rui and Yuta are just the two. And they both got in pretty recently.  If you're just talking about homegrown players, we have Kai coming up, maybe even Lebron Lopez, Kobe Paras. If you're talking about Pinoy blood, then we already have Clarkson. Jalen Green is gonna be drafted next."
"Rj barrett, knicks ecf, celtics blow up, okc title, jalen green mvp, bronny and bron ring, booker mvp"
"RJ Barrett will be considered a top 15 player in the league  Knicks will make it to the ECF once in this timespan   Celtics blow up their core and rebuild  Kevin Durant leaves the Nets (without winning a ring) when he’s a FA and goes back to OKC, and leads them to a ring  Luka Doncic is the best player in the league (but on a different team)  Like you said, Kawhi retires early  Cade Cunningham is first team All NBA in 2026, leads the pistons to the ECF, but is not the best player in his draft  Jalen Green wins an MVP in 2026 and leads the Rockets to the finals  Kings finally make the playoffs  Lebron retires in 2025, after playing with Bronny. Wins a ring with Bronny.   Trae Young leaves the Hawks to help form a super team out west, with Nikola Jokic  Suns and CP3 win back to back rings this year and next year   Devin Booker wins 1 MVP  Giannis wins another MVP and a ring in 2023  Seattle and Las Vegas get expansion teams, bringing the NBA to 32 teams  James Wiseman is traded next summer and thrives with his new team"
"So who's better? Jalen Green? In the FIBA final, playing om the same team against the same competition, Green put up 1/0/1, Cade put up 21/7/7 and was the unquestioned go to guy and leader on a team that had a good NBA player (Tyrese Haliburton). That means Cade is at least as good as Haliburton (probably)."
Jalen Green and KPJ dynasty  No bias
"This just isn't true.  Post lottery statements:    Pistons GM Troy Weaver - ""Yes, that's an option"" when asked about trading #1 pick.   James Edwards III of the Athletic - ""G League Ignite guard Jalen Green and USC center guard Evan Mobley are under, 'Strong Consideration' by the Pistons.""   Troy Weaver - ""We’ll uncover every stone and put ourselves in the right position to get the right guy for the Pistons. … We’ll look at everything; we’ll be aggressive and have the mindset to improve this team by all means necessary.”    Troy Weaver - “We’ll look at everything; we’ll look at 5 guys in the draft,""  Maybe you should be the new Pistons gm though, since you clearly know better."
"I want Jalen Green, Kai Sotto, and Jordan Clarkson on the squad. Coached by Mike Spoelstra. A man can dream."
With the Rockets reportedly preferring Jalen Green they're gonna get Mobley who should fit fine next to JA if his 3pt shot is decent and he's as athletic and mobile as he's hyped to be.
"Not a pick lower than 18 because the protections fade over time, and seriously, think about this like Jalen Green + Alperen Sengun + Jared Butler for Cade or something like that. What people are missing on this sub is how frequently prospects defy expectations after the draft, for all the talk you don't really know how a prospect will pan out. I hope rockets don't trade if it takes one of those kinds of packages and I think if a trade is made it's going to surprise 99% of people on this sub. It'll happen because the Pistons like somebody other than Cade, and it'll get a much smaller haul than two firsts (And the #2)"
"There has been a lot circulating about pistons wanting Jalen Green, whether it's true or not. And the Rockets have a shit ton of draft capital along with a couple young players. You guys could reunite with Wood lol"
"dream scenario is houston take jalen suggs, cleveland take mobley and jalen green falls to us"
"If Lillard wants out and Portland wants to rebuild, is there any scenario where they could end up with Jalen Green in a trade?"
I don’t think it’s nonsense to discuss trading down for Jalen Green + assets if Troy really was that high on him like some reports showed. He’s hit on lottery reaches with us and I would trust him 100% if he did go that route.   Definitely saw some delusional trade rumors though based around SGA to Det for Cade which I don’t think either team’s fanbase would be too thrilled about.
"He really said this? It’s better then saying 1 game at a time, but it’d be more believable if he didn’t have to be in no mans land Detroit—— also Jalen Green is the the better player I believe Roty is gon be hard to get"
"True haha, but you sure the Jalen Green rumors ain’t getting to you a little bit xD?"
THere's a chance  https://rocketswire.usatoday.com/2021/07/16/report-rockets-leaning-jalen-green-with-no-2-pick-some-prefer-jalen-suggs/
When Cade plays Jalen Green
&gt; You aren't drafting a PG who has concerns with ball handling and shooting over Jalen Green or even Mobley.  Stop deflecting. That's not what you said. You said he was a defensive pg.
&gt; Suggs is just a 6'4 Davion Mitchell 🤦  Nobody said that but you.   You aren't drafting a PG who has concerns with ball handling and shooting over Jalen Green or even Mobley.
"&gt;But the selection at no. 2 will cause ripple effects throughout the draft. Will the Rockets’ choice be Jalen Green, a 6-foot-5 scorer who played in the G League? Evan Mobley, a versatile big man out of USC? Jalen Suggs, a floor general from Gonzaga? Or will they trade down?  &gt;League sources say the Rockets prefer Green. Selecting him would make perfect sense: Not only is scoring a premium skill, he’s also flashed playmaking ability. Green is raw, but the Rockets have a young team that doesn’t need to worry about contending anytime soon. He’s a hard worker, and at just 19 years old, he’s only starting to tap into his full potential as an elite athlete with shot-creation skills. It would not be a shocker if he ends up as this draft’s best player.  &gt;Though Mobley and Suggs remain in consideration, teams are planning for scenarios in which Houston will pick Green.   https://www.theringer.com/2021/7/16/22579643/nba-draft-houston-rockets-cade-cunningham-jalen-green-evan-mobley"
"Because Luka is one of the best players of his generation and is on a path to becoming an easy Hall of Famer. He's probably one of the 5 or 6 best players at 22 in the history of the league. The odds that **anyone** gets to that level are extremely low, which is why the comparison is stupid. Jalen Green kinda plays like MJ, should we just call him the Californian MJ?"
I got   Trae young   Jalen Green  Luka Doncic  Devin Booker   Giannis
"We can only hope Troy Weaver gets possessed by Vlade. Actually fuck it, every GM gets possessed by Vlade and we end up getting Jalen fucking Green on a silver platter."
I think Jalen Green plays too reckless. I think teams should pass him up coz his health ain't gonna get better with his twiggy frame and Westbrook style of driving.
Houston ending up with Jalen green and James wiseman after 1 year of being bad is elite processing
"Doncic, Giannis, SGA, Jalen Green, Poku"
"Luka, Cade/Jalen Suggs/Jalen Green, Wenbanyama, Chet, Tatum/Brown"
"Assuming he can still get those foul calls next season and beyond, I’d put Trae in that top 3. Even ahead of Tatum. Jalen Green will be on this list after next season too I feel."
I'm all aboard that Jalen Green hype train
No question. 13 isnt really that good for detroit to even think about it unless they really love jalen green
1. Luka 2. Zion 3. Tatum 4. Wenbanyama  5. Jalen Green   Although I could literally come up dozens of combinations of guys to fill the last 3 spots.
i think the Rockets will take Jalen Green not Mobley
Not with Jalen Green on the board.
"Lol no. Rockets have no problem taking Jalen Green and 2-3 1sts on top of a #2 pick is ludicrous. Not to mention y'all's gm has already publicly states how much he loves Green and isn't afraid to go with the non consensus choice. #2 and another high 1st is already above market for the #1 pick. I think it's more than fair for y'all if Green is as good as people are starting to believe. Personally, I would make that move 10 out of 10 times if I were y'all. Green ticks all my boxes for franchise superstar. Only reason I would hesitate is Cade has expressed he would love Detroit and idk how Green feels."
I wouldn’t compare Jalen Green to Darko Milicic
He’s saying Mobley better than jalen green
Welcome Jalen Green*
"if the pistons actually want jalen green over cade, then the rockets should just stay put so they can get cade without trading up"
Just get Jalen Green. Who gives a fuck lol.
I don't see how it has anything to do with Jalen Green either way.  Green is a scoring wing - you could plug him into any team and if he develops he'll fit.  The issue is the Garland/Sexton backcourt is just not a viable future.
"He's about to get a massive pay raise and there is a questionable fit on the team he is currently on. They are also in position where they probably draft someone positionally similar.  It's pretty straightforward.   If the Cavs aren't willing to pay him a large amount of money they should move Sexton.  If they decide Garland is the guy they want going forward they should move Sexton.  If Jalen Green/Suggs is their pick and they view him as redundant with Garland/Sexton then they should move Sexton.  I'm not saying I agree or disagree with it, but that's why."
"My personal opinion is because they think they're getting Jalen Green. The most popular rumor is that it's supposedly because they don't want to pay him, but it's hard to buy that when so many other teams seem willing to."
"I’ve been an NBA fan for almost 10 years, here’s what I got.  - Don’t base your opinions off of everybody else (so like this Reddit)  - There aren’t really teams that people necessarily bandwagon to anymore, but I would say find a team you like and stick to them. Personally, I love Golden State. Also, find some players you can watch! I love watching Steph, Giannis, Luka, Jalen Green (he’ll be drafted soon), etc.  - Look into the NBA drafts! They happen once a year around summertime. This year, it’s on July 29th I believe.  - Watch some highlights on YouTube. You get to study their game a little more. I also like watching “funny” compilations because it makes a player more “likeable” to me.   - Watch with friends/family/etc. I watch with my dad and brother and I swear we wake the neighborhood up.  -"
"Every year it's something. Dude is a comet pretending to be star--by the time playoffs come, he's vapor. Far far from Giannis/Lebron tier. Stat-padder got an MVP for Morey's system and amazing role-players (Tucker, Capela, etc). CP3 carried his ass until he got injured against the   Pop quiz: What's the greatest playoff win during Harden's tenure with Houston?   Game 6, 4th quarter 17 point come-back...with Harden on the bench.   Fuck, as a Rockets fan, I'm so glad we get to start over. Glad Jalen Green doesn't play like a bitch."
"No.  I’m saying that you cannot push the blame completely at the refs when a team misses 27 straight threes.   Anyways, that series happened three years ago, no point in continuing this 💀   Rockets had a chance to redeem themselves, then failed. Golden State isn’t as dominant anymore and the Rockets will have Jalen Green in less than 3 weeks."
"Cade Cunningham, Jalen Green, and Evan Mobley are some of the top draft prospects. If want to learn more about the NBA watch games or channels like BBallbreakdown, Dom2k, LegendofWinning, etc. You can also play some 2k if you play video games. Also do not go into NBA twitter, it’s worse than this place and I can’t escape it"
"Keep an eye on Cade Cunningham, Jalen Green, and Evan Mobley (the projected top 3 picks). Idk what else to really tell you cuz idk much about this draft."

the picture shows the players that the teams with the top 3 picks take and jalen green isnt there
"Oh, ik but it's not too crazy to pick Jalen green over him."
"I mean Jalen Green is hooping in the G League, there's nothing wrong in picking him over Cade."
"Smoke from who? No credible reporter has ever said they think Detroit will take anyone other than Cunningham. They can like Jalen Green as a prospect but like Cade better, which is what every report since the lottery has alluded to."
The next jalen green
"Yea bro we on the same page. All these dummies thinks Cade Cunningham is going to be a beast. Cunningham is extremely talented, but who knows how his motor is going to translate in the NBA. Jalen Green going to be a bonafide superstar, people underestimate the G league, but he was cookin grown men"
And with the #1 pick in the 2021 NBA Draft the Houston Rockets select...JALEN GREEN!
"&gt; Second, are you really saying you would rather have Cunningham over Jalen Green/Mobley, KPJ, Christian Wood, and several first round picks?  WTF? Yes. Absolutely. I'll take a dollar over a couple quarters and a couple dimes. What kind of question is that?  Weaver traded the pick for a reason. The protections on the pick were structured that way for a reason. No, they don't want that pick back.   They let Wood go because he has an attitude problem. No, they don't want him back."
NOOOOOOOOOOO why does Detroit need to sell the fucking bag we get lucky for once in the past decade and we goddamn ruin it. Cade is the player we need not jalen green
kpj/jalen green/jaesean tate/kj martin/christian wood isnt a bad core
"Jalen green is the best player in this draft, he's D Wade with a better jumper, just watch"
"Even if Jalen Green becomes the best player from this draft (I think he really will be), this is the Pistons' first pick in 51 years and will be criticized big if they don't do the consensus and take Cunningham with the first pick."
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.detroitbadboys.com/platform/amp/2021/6/30/22558029/nba-draft-rumors-detroit-pistons-jalen-green-cade-cunningham
"There’s reports that they are looking at Green, not sure why they would need to throw smoke if they got the number one pick.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.detroitbadboys.com/platform/amp/2021/6/30/22558029/nba-draft-rumors-detroit-pistons-jalen-green-cade-cunningham"
Jalen Green was playing against men in the GLeague. Dont get it twisted. I think he's more of a sure thing than Cade.
This isn't Darko. Jalen Green will be great and the only reason taking him #1 is controversial is because he wasn't in college.
"Jalen Green is the guy I wanted too.  A lot of pressure with this number 1 pick, and having picked Darko before with Melo right there.  If Cade turns out to be a superstar we look dumb for passing on him, even if we wanted Green all along"
Hot take: Jalen Green has the highest ppg as a rookie since MJ in 84 (meaning he has more than David Robinson’s 24.3 ppg)
"A 3pt shot and like 40 pounds. He has some guard skills but not full on PG skills. Either way they have similarly high ceilings. Jalen Green has a superstar wing ceiling, Mobley has a superstar combo big ceiling."
"First of all, the Rockets best asset is probably their own 2022 pick. They also have their own 2023 (with a BKN swap option). Second, are you really saying you would rather have Cunningham over Jalen Green/Mobley, KPJ, Christian Wood, and several first round picks?   I don't feel like the argument makes much sense that it is a bunch of stuff they already got rid of.  KPJ never even played for the Pistons, he was traded for 4 picks so it wasn't like they just let him go, and his value is way higher now than it was when he was pick 30.  Christian Wood's value is also a little higher than it was when he left.  Why is it relevant that one of the picks that would be involved is technically the Pistons pick? Do you not want that pick back?"
"Personally, I'm not sold on Jalen ending up as the better scorer. Guys who are known/labeled as playmakers always end up being perceived as lesser scorers. The clear example of this is LBJ, he gets talked about constantly as not a scorer, and yet he's going to end up as the NBA's all time leading scorer, including playoffs, and averages 27 a game for his career. Not saying Cade is going to be Lebron obviously, but I can totally see him actually being a better scorer than Green and just not being perceived as a scorer because of his label as a playmaker, if that makes sense."
"Why do people keep hyping up the G League like it means anything?  Tremont Waters absolutely tore up the G League and even put up better stats in the G League than he did in college.  Yet he completely sucks in the NBA.    Or Anthony Bennett - #1 overall draft pick who is so bad he couldn't even stick with an NBA team suddenly looked like one of the best players in the G League.    The G League is every man for themselves and barely resembles the team sport that is the NBA.  College ball actually does.    We will see.  Ultimately I don't think it much matters as talent is talent.  But I find it very strange how people are hyping up the G League as some kind of superior league and like Jaylen Green scoring 17 ppg is some amazing feat that will translate.  Jalen Green could *easily* end up a run of the mill 15 ppg mediocre scorer in the NBA.  Easily.  Yes there is upside, but his floor is pretty low."
"Pistons have been reportedly high in Jalen green all season and this has been known by everyone. Things change when you get the number one pick. It would be dumb to assume you are going to get #1 and not scout other players, especially when the Pistons knew the ballpark where they’d pick. This is not news"
I'd do it. Jalen Green will be the best player in this draft
"If we get Jalen Green, it makes Sexton redundant in our lineup. Green is widely seen as having a higher ceiling than Sexton, and as an incoming rookie he will be cheaper over the next several years, whereas Sexton is probably going to ask for a max.    We don't need ""better"" players than him, but we could use a roleplayer or two, and probably a first round pick."
"Mobley definitely comes in as a 4 and is an underrated shooter. Quite frankly regardless of whether the team keeps or trades Allen, they aren't good. There's no reason they can't spend the year focusing on building the shooting of Mobley (and Okoro). Teams will want Allen so they can always do a S&amp;T and play them together in the meantime. Best case scenario, Mobley proves he does have shooting capabilities and the fit works out much better than anticipated. Worst case scenario? They lose a bunch, which is what they are already currently slated to do anyways. They have nothing to lose by playing them together.  All that being said, Jalen Green is the truth and I hope they get him"
Jalen Green is my favorite player in this draft.  He will win at least 1 dunk contest.
"Jalen Green played in the G-League with NBA rules and an NBA 3-point line, while Cade played in college with college rules and a shortened 3-point line."
"&gt;[Dammarell]According to sources, the Detroit Pistons are enamored with prospect Jalen Green while the Houston Rockets are keen on Oklahoma State star Cade Cunningham. Trade discussions are ongoing but it feels like those two players are all but locked in at the top of the 2021 NBA Draft."
So you're telling me Jalen Green will be a potato farmer in 15 years
"Detroit isn’t moving down without some lottery pick(s) or like the 2024 Brooklyn pick.  Cade is the best prospect, he had superstar potential without the hint of personality worries that Jalen Green and Mobley have, Cade is the safest prospect too."
Yea rebuilds take time took us three years and we were considered fast but you guys look like your off to a good start with kpj and Jalen green
"I think Jalen Green is the ROTY favorite, he's gonna fill it up even more than Cunningham"
"Jalen Green, KPJ, Banchero and Sengun BIG 4 coming soon"
Jalen Green and KPJ.  Check back in 10 years
"Disagree Jalen Green and Hardy may come into the league shooting 10 a night at 19. Hardy IMO is the best shooter of any platform coming into the league since Curry. His offensive game is actually more advanced than Green who has significant work to do on playmaking (tunnel vision).    Its not as much about ""will a guy shoot 50 percent from distance with off the dribble volume in our lifetime"" most people imagine it may be... Its about longevity and league style of play."
Jalen Green is an immature clown
Jalen Green is an immature clown
"Its weird you're getting downvoted this much.  Don't people always derisively say the regular season doesn't matter, and wished it mattered more?  Giving a wider breadth of teams a spotlight is how you get more people to care about the regular season and care more about the other teams.  Extreme short term scheduling like this harms the league as a whole.  Any business would do better to plan out further than the next year, or the next quarter.  Guys like Lebron, Steph, KD already have massive fanbases that will follow them and watch them and buy their stuff no matter what city they are at.  They're set.  Its the guys like Cade who needs to prove he's the #1 seed, or Jalen Green to show other teams made a mistake in thinking he's #2, Anthony Edwards who needs to be given a chance to play for a national audience, Lamelo who should be allowed to capitalize on his social media fanbase, Siakam who was touted as one of the next crop of superstars when they won the championship.    The league is looking at a massive hole in interest like the years right after MJ left when each of the top guys start retiring in the next 5 or so years.  Building up younger players now is a way to prevent that drop from being so steep.  Fuck the casuals, they are casuals who are interested in watching only Lebron and Steph *because* the NBA treats them like casuals.  Give them a dose of Lamelo and his passing, show them Ja Morant flying through the air, have them watch Lavine dunk on guys all night.  It may not take immediately, but that's how you turn casuals into fans, because there's a lot of people living in the midwest or in cities like Cinncinati or Topeka or Vegas who may only be able to watch the national games, and we've had a decade of Lebron ruling the airwaves.  If they're not fans already, then feeding them more of the same isn't going to get them interested."
"I don't think anyone is sleeping on the Hornets, but I think they'll be as good as the 6th seed, floor is 9th. Graham being gone might actually help them not have a log jam at guard, but I looked him on this team.  I think the Rockets and Pacers are good sleepers.  I really like the players the Rockets have like Christian Wood, John Wall, Jalen Green, Kevin Porter Jr among others, and their head coach.  I don't like how the roster had played over the last few seasons for the Pacers, but Rick Carlisle is a big reason why I think they could surprise people.   I want to say the Magic so bad, but Jonathan Isaac will be out a lot of the season, but Fultz is coming back with Cole and Suggs. They still have Ross and MCW off the bench too, but I know nothing about Jamahl Mosley"
Jalen green already at 49th
"Yeah while Cade was the consensus #1 this year, he was consensus by safety. He’s absolutely at the top of the draft, but as a player he’s way less flashy or entertaining than other past #1 picks. Hell hes less flashy and hyped than Jalen Green, and the main reason Cade went #1 is that he’s a much safer prospect than Green."
Jalen Green being top 50 without playing a game yet is crazy
Lol if Jalen green didn't go off with a few quotes us and Detroit would be down there with y'all
"Jalen has a lot more followers than Green, that would explain the weird Cade hate on instagram"
Damn I really wanted to see jalen green in detroit  I guess im going to have to wait
Jalen Green will be top 10 by his third year.
Jalen green so high is kinda surprising to me
"So Nike got Cade Cunningham, Jonathan Kuminga, and now Scottie Barnes. Adidas got Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, and Evan Mobley already.  That just leaves Josh Giddey as the only sneaker deal-less of the Top 7"
That honestly sounds like wishful thinking coming from your end. I'd suggest getting over the 2018 WCF and channeling whatever feelings you still have towards the warriors into love for your new star Jalen Green.
"Well no, Jalen Green is the Rockets' pick, they got him for tanking, not in exchange for Harden"
Would have got Jalen Green regardless because they were tanking
We wouldn’t have KPJ or Green if we took the Simmons package  KPJ was waived because of the Taurean Prince locker room incident. Taurean Prince was traded to Cavs in the harden trade and then took KPJ’s locker  Jalen Green was gotten from us getting the number two pick. We would’ve lost our pick of it landed outside the top 4 and it would have if we had Simmons because he’d prolly win us 3-6 games.  It’s also important to note that Simmons is on a max for 4 years and we still have Wall on a super max for two more years. I think a complete rebuild was a better option  I do think we should’ve traded Harden for like MPJ and picks but I’m not sure that deal was even available
Probably Westbrook. Kawhi's too stiff to resemble Jordan and his shot elevation isn't as high. I think Jalen Green will be a good candidate.
I’ll have to look into jalen green
Jalen Green = rookie Jordan with a better shot
Still got draft picks and jalen green out of it.
I like Jalen Green imo
Guess jalen green went to schiff school
fuck crypto - jalen green
You could have a deep team if you chose Jalen   - Jalen Rose - Jalen Green - Jalen Brunson - Jalen Johnson - Jalen Suggs - Jalen McDaniels - Jalen Smith  Funnily enough a lot of them are really young
Jalen Green: bitcoin is a scam buy gold
"I just don't see Toronto having a good roster really. Especially assuming Dragic doesn't stay long if at all. Siakam and VanVleet along with a mostly meh roster. Anunoby is gonna be their only other decent player imo.  Houston is being underrated here imo. Wood, Wall, and Gordon (assuming the last two stay) are all decent-good players. KPJ and Tate are not bad either. Then we have Jalen Green and Serungen, who I think will have good impacts as rookies. I don't think we are great or anything, but definitely not at the bottom.  San Antonio is in a similar boat, but with less talent, but still just seems better than the 5 I listed above to me.  Cleveland, Orlando, and Detroit are gonna suck. OKC probably won't be good at all either. Toronto is barely better than those 4 imo"
"Not sure any of those makes sense. Simmons might have been ok if the Cavs had gotten Jalen Green or Cade, but I don't really like any of those fits with EM.   I think the Cavs really need to stay put and see what makes sense around Mobley, who is their highest upside guy."
Jalen Green
Jalen Green team ham and cheese fasho
Can Jalen Green reach Caris LeVert’s level?
"&gt;However this suffering is not close to what real rockets fans suffered when watching their team lose 20 something straight after 7 years of being competitive     Rockets fans have been rewarded with Jalen Green and a promising future after a single terrible year lol. One bad season ain't suffering lol. Harden isn't going to get rewarded for missing another chance to get a ring. It just adds to the choker narrative."
"Seems like both Jalen Green and Cade are busts, huh"
Jalen Green is a nice kid to everyone but about to develop an MJ personality against Cade and Detroit
Christian Wood  Jalen Green  Alperen Sengun  Kevin Porter Jr  Usman Garuba  Kenyon Martin Jr  Armoni Brooks  Jae’Sean Tate   Josh Christopher
At least more athletic than Jalen Green (who he easily bodied on a break and broke the ankles of before even seeing an NBA weightroom)
I genuinely hope we get 15 years of jalen green hating on everything cade does lol there isnt enough petty hate in todays nba
"""I want to like peanut butter and jelly, but I heard they have those things in Detroit.   I don't like detroit.""  - Jalen Green, when asked about food in Houston"
Jalen Green:  Fuck Detroit for not picking me number one!  Cade Cunningham:  I like PBJ.
I dunno man this guy winning me over way more Jalen green
He quit on his team on the 4th game. His legacy is shattered. Lost respect for him smh. Jalen Green should’ve been number 1.
Rockets:   - Jalen Green - Alperen Sengun - Usman Garuba - Josh Christopher - Kevin Porter JR - Christian Wood - Jae'sean Tate - KJ Martin
Jalen Green about to have a partnership with Starkist Tuna.
Jalen Green: ...fuck peanut butter and jelly sandwiches!
"He basically retired to become a trainer so I wouldn't say he's out of practice, [here's him training and playing 1v1 against Jalen Green](https://youtu.be/46qdiUjwHKY)"
this is whybim glad i got jalen green instead 😌
"if Jalen green did this dunk, or even Kai Jones, it'd be a much bigger deal. even in summer league this shit is ridiculous. there's a reason people said brown might be the best pure athlete in the draft even if he generally doesn't know how to play basketball lmao"
"r/DetroitPistons has 17 posts about Jalen Green at the moment, r/rockets has 11  I don't think most Rockets fan give a fuck about Cunningham"
I'd take jalen green for fun
Jalen green subbed to r/nbacirclejerk confirmed
Anthony Edwards and Jalen Green.
"Welp, I guess I'm team Green. Let's go Jalen!"
"Most high level prospect probably know Steph personally because of his camp it's invite only for the top prospects I believe. Guys like Jalen Green, Ant, MPJ, Cade, Trae etc."
"The obvious 2 superstar candidates are Cade and Jalen Green. Suggs would be my other guy becoming a star in the league.   Barnes and Kuminga are both developmental guys, so depending on how their development goes they can be rotation guys or lower level stars"
Another reason why Jalen Green should've gone #1
"Jalen Green: “Win a real ring, LeMickey”"
"Cade and Jalen Green *definitely* have been hyped as potential superstars. It's just that it's really impossible to predict *who's* gonna reach that level, it only happens once every couple drafts or so on average"
"Jalen Green declares war on Detroit, and Cade Cunningham declares war on common sense. /s"
"It would a better nickname for Jalen Green, kind of confusing"
Jalen Green is my favorite to watch so far of all the rookies. I hope he keeps getting buckets and talking shit.   Cam Thomas is nice too.
The Jalen Green posts over there will probably take a dark/depressing turn (similar to the Luka posts on the Kings sub) as the years go on.
"Probably more in terms of culture. Morant seems very gen z to me, especially the stuff on Instagram and Twitter with Curry. Jalen Green seems like another one.  I think it's characterised by being a bit more 'risk taking' in terms of brand after growing up with social media and the fragmentation of culture where it's more successful to be niche than attempt to appeal to everyone. As well as Gen z people growing up with a bit more freedom than Millennials who had more of a microscope on them."
More like a *Jalen Green v. the City of Detroit*
"Every Piston fan back then thought we were getting Melo. I remember everytime Melo had a big game we was like what did Darko do, oh yeah, nothing.  I loved Tay though, idk how we would’ve made it fit but I would’ve loved Melo here.  That’s why I’m scared this year. Cade is the obvious pick but I love Jalen Green.  I hope we didn’t mess up another draft.  Still not over Luke Kennard over Mitchell, when we projected to take Mitchell"
"Listen, teams have to show star players they care about what they want and the Timberwolves have given KAT two years with his best bud when they could have gone a different direction.  If anyone gets traded though it would be D’Lo, he only has 1 more year under contract after this season anyway. Imagine if the Rockets traded Jalen Green or the Cavs Evan Mobley for *Ben Simmons*, that’s what losing Anthony Edwards amounts to."
NBA robbed us of Jalen Green getting booed in Detroit on Christmas.
i thought for sure that he was about to shit on detroit like jalen green
Fair enough. That person is completely off base. I personally view the Rockets and Pistons as very similar historically. Coincidentally it seems that we are in a similar place and on the same trajectory with our current teams too. Best of luck to ya'll and Jalen Green.
"Jalen ""nice guys finish last"" Green"
"Rockets Fans are Delusional  Context: I am a Rockets fan myself and I am realy frustrated about my fellow fans and here is why:  People claim Harden was not a happy fit in Houston because he wasn't happy in the halfcourt and that he only was a spot-up shooter. Meanwhile those same people want Point Al P/Point KPJ. So why does Harden have to be happy in the halfcourt when he IS USED as an spot-up shooter? Also, Harden literaly was the only above average defender in the starting line-up last year. Yes, KJ Martin sucked last year and the same counts for Tate.  Meanwhile Rockets fans are happy that Harden left and say they won the trade when they literaly got somebody who averages a worse 3p% last season on the same amount of shots who has no synergy with Al P/Jalen Green and need the ball in his hands (more then Harden). Also Harden-Al P connection was happy. After this trade Rockets decide to throw a 38m/3yr bag at Ryan Anderson who has said that he wanted out. Ryan Anderson is an awful on ball defender and is not happy but he shot 33% from 3 last year and the Rockets need shooting? So they S+T the best shooter on the team who has great chemistry with the stars for a worse shooter who has no synergy but is better in the halfcourt where he won't touch the ball more then Harden and they give 38m/3yr to one of the worst 3pt% guards they have. Sorry but this is not happy, that is delusional and stupid."
"I think they will start KPJ, Jalen Green and John Wall until they eventually buy him out"
This is what Jalen Green will soon be doing.
"its thoughtless, but I understand why someone would ask the question. people do the ""assuming Len got to play, he'd have _______"" all the time. i think Clarke would have gone ahead of Bouknight, for example, in all likelihood. not sure if he would have entered the Suggs or Jalen Green tiers. it's a bit insensitive but common enough hypothetical conversation."
"which is funny bc that streak will continue, Jalen Green just spells bust"
Jalen green wanted to stay in Houston for the strip clubs
"I don't watch college basketball at all so I'm not going to pretend like I know how good of a prospect Mobley is. I did however pay attention to the G-league ignite because I was interested in seeing how top prospects would play as 18 year olds against experienced NBA players. I don't know if Jalen Green or Mobley has more potential, I just know that Green has a lot of potential.  Just how often do we see KG archetypes reach their full potential compared to Bradley Beal archetypes?"
😂 learn to read child the league should punish him you illiterate fuck   Jalen Green fan girls already in full effect  this dude is a locker room cancer and i’m happy houston has him  enjoy
"Recency bias, but i will say Jalen Green dissing DET"
Jalen Green gonna learn from Harden in Houston. Already making Detroit fans hate him.
"""WHY DONT HE WANT ME MANNNN"" *takes deep breathe* ""fuck detroit piece of shit city I hate them and everyone who lives there"" - Jalen Green"
fuck jalen green
Jalen Green Summer League MVP
Jalen Green about to get booed in Detroit his whole career
Jalen green
"Why does it feel manufactured? Because it's on social media? I think Jalen Green is definitely feeling pretty right now, not sure why he would fake it.  We'll never know what Kobe and MJ would have done if they grew up in the social media age. MJ might be talking so much shit on Twitter."
Solution: we flip Jalen Green to Green Jalen.
I still like Jalen Green. Chill on my city tho
What's the funniest part about the whole situation is that Houston wanted Cade all along  They were throwing out offers until the day before the draft.  They were actively trading for the guy that Detroit ended up picking.  So even the team that drafted him didnt want him. They already had a big man they had to take him by default. Wood is what Cleveland hopes Mody Moses can become.  Jalen Green is acting like a clown lets see if he can back up his shit talking
"1.	Commenting “That’s tuff🔥” on an in memoriam social media post of a teammate who’s already publicly-perceived-mentally-unwell (I don’t know that man Harrell so won’t speak in absolutes)   2.	Not being vaccinated  3.	Not being vaccinated and trying to throw the face of the league under the bus  4.	Scoring zero points on a premier franchise in a playoff game   5.	Betting on himself and failing (how dare he be confident in himself I guess, I don’t much understand why people are legitimately upset at this one rather than just clowning)  6.	Demanding starter minutes when being the new guy on a team who literally just won it all without him  7.	Declining to play for the national team by way of an insanely overvalued insurance expectation   8.	More I can’t think of off the dome.   Fans get emotional and irrational about just about anything related to sports. Hell, I haven’t even been in Michigan since like 2004 and I’m still salty about Jalen Green running his mouth (after already saying he wanted to be in Detroit previously; you ain’t slick, Jalen)."
Sad that jalen is getting roty and is a future superstar? Your front office fucked up not drafting green.
"Jordan didn't need to shit talk Hakeem cause he knew dream was the real deal. Hakeem was dominant on both ends and it was believed in that era, a team needed a great bigman to win the championship. So I don't think Jordan would feel disrespected. I doubt Jalen Green believes Cade is better than him. If Jordan didn't respect you, he would hound you to no end and try to break your will."
Lmfaooo this is about Jalen Green? You really got your panties in a bunch because Detroit fans think they have the better player and leader?!  🤣😂😭
Fax. It’s even funnier when people complain about how buddy-buddy the NBA has gotten but get salty when someone like jalen green says something like this
Jalen “I wanted to he the number 1 pick but I didn’t want to be the number 1 pick” Green
Jalen isn’t even beefing with Cade. It’s not about Jalen thinking Cade not 1 it’s about green thinking Green is 1. Anyone at summer league can tell you right now they are very coo with each other.
"Stephen Silas seems like the nicest dude on earth. Not a Rockets fan, but would love to see this guy have some success now that he’s got Jalen Green on board. He’s earned it."
Jalen Green with the cameo at the end
"&gt;-Miami still loses in round 1 even with Lowry  If they get past the 2nd round, I'll be very surprised.  &gt;-MPJ is an all star  This is doable, but he might fuck himself with his vaccination status.  &gt;-Ben Simmons doesn’t play a game this season  I think he'll play, but not until the new year at least.   Other than that:  the Bulls will be top 3 in the East,  Scottie Barnes will surprise everyone once he gets rolling halfway through the season, and will finish 2nd in ROTY voting after Jalen Green."
"Star - Russell Westbrook - He's in a spot where he can do what he does best, but, without needing to be the first or second scoring option. Lebron tends not to miss when it comes to picking stars as teammates, and, Westbrook has a spirit that won't quit.  Emerging Star - Kevin Porter Jr. - he's got the keys as full time, starting PG for to the Rockets, and is equipped with young talent in Jalen Green and Alperen Sengun, along with more seasoned players in Christian Wood and Daniel Theis. He put up a monstrous performance against the reigning champs (resulting in a rare victory  for the Rockets last season), to go along with some moments of promising play before the season's end  Unproven Star - Scottie Barnes - there were many skeptics who voiced their disapproval of the Raptors choosing Scottie Barnes so high, but, he showed out in the Summer League. I think Scottie Barnes may very well end up making an impactful statement for why the Raptors choose him, especially within an organization that has a strong reputation for developing young players"
"Stone took the right deal. If the Rockets took Simmons back, they win probably 4-6 more games last season and lose out on their draft pick since it was only top 4 protected.   Short term? Yeah, the Simmons trade makes them better, but not good enough to be a playoff team. I’d take Jalen Green on a cost-controlled contract + the Brooklyn picks any day over Ben Simmons + no top pick in 2021 and the Sixers picks."
More like toss is Jalen Green to Philly and Maxey to Houston as a swap in addition.
I think we might get a pretty good Rockets v Pistons rivalry based off of the whole Jalen Green stuff. Don’t see it lasting long term or anything but the couple of games we play against each other this year are going to be fun
&gt; f all the guys signed off on it and they even told Ben then the only explanation is that the Rockets preferred the Nets deal  This sounds about right.  Rockets (correctly) surmised that tanking and getting a top-5 pick multiple years in a row is better than being in 30 win purgatory while trying to build around Ben Simmons.  I'd much rather have Jalen Green and all the Nets 1sts (which will be trash until maybe 2026) than Simmons and whatever picks Philly would have thrown (probably not many).
"Honestly I don’t have much faith in Kyrie. This dude has caused a toxic team environment everywhere he’s been. I wouldn’t be surprised if he demands a trade in a few years.  As for KD, I think injuries will catch up to him. He missed slot of games this past season, and this is coming right after his majorly u jury where he missed the whole 2019-2020 season. I think he’ll she gracefully, but I don’t think KD can “carry” the nets if he can’t stay healthy until he regular season  Harden is really the one I’m worried about most. He’s the only one of the 3 that can legit carry a team. But who knows what he does after he wins his ring.  Idk but in all honesty, if we got Simmons we prolly don’t end up in the lottery. And I just rather have Jalen Green and assets vs Ben Simmons and two first rounders. Ben Simmons is great at defense, but his offense is horrendous."
"Yeah, kinda agree  We need a star before FAs take interest in us compared to Miami/NY/LA. Pray Jalen Green/KPJ break out"
Obviously jalen green.   He can be a mega star for the next decade. Rockets can build a great team around him now
"Tilman manadating that Jalen Green/Christian Wood/KPJ package to make the rockets push for the play in game, those playoff revenues are sweet"
"&gt;[Perry was teammates with Scottie Barnes on the gold-winning USA U-19 World Cup team in 2019. That team also featured Cade Cunningham, Jalen Green, Evan Mobley, Jalen Suggs and Tyrese Haliburton... but it was Perry that came away with tournament MVP.](https://twitter.com/JLew1050/status/1440347658443374609)  👀"
"Jalen green isn’t a baby face, he just has a bunch of 13 year old meat riders who always say big body bands member I used to be dusty.  Not saying JG4 is bad tho"
"Babyface will be Curry, or an outside chance it's Jalen Green.  Heel in the actual sense will be the Nets as a team, but the fun-to-hate, goofy, wrestling-style, ""I will most definitely be smiling if I get to take a picture with them after the game"" heel role firmly belongs to Trae Young and Joel Embiid. Last year people realized that those two guys are too good to disrespect and incredibly fun to root against."
"If salary cap sees a big jump, it could lead to a situation similar to where Warriors were able to sign Kevin Durant when they normally wouldn't have been able to. Looking at players that would be entering free agency in their primes - Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, John Collins - would be the biggest beneficiaries.      Second beneficiaries are the 2021 rookie class as they become Restricted Free Agents in 2025. This might benefit teams as the cap hold for these players will be lower than normal as a percentage of cap space, so they would be able to utilize cap space first then resign RFAs using bird rights. These players include Cade Cunningham, Evan Mobley, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs.      None of these players would have incentive to sign extensions before 2025 as they can get substantially more by waiting for the new TV deal and higher salary cap.  I expect teams to maximize cap space in 2025 to increase their flexibility and target the number of free agents in this class, assuming players don't sign long term extension in anticipation of larger deals in 2025."

I think jalen green is good enough for them not to have the worst record in the league. It's a toss up between okc the magic and pistons.
Jalen Green will be a bust and the rockets aren't very good anyway. The pistons are way better
"probably picking the most obvious team here, but:  KPJ  Jalen Green  Jae'Sean Tate  Christian Wood  Alperen Sengun  Off the Bench: Eric Gordon, KMJ, Nwaba, Theis, Josh Christopher, Gerald Green  Bold of me to only use one superstar: Gerald Green"
"might be Perk's best take yet... its surely the scenario that works best, **for best sides**, when you compare all of the different Ben Simmons' trade pkgs so far.  &amp;#x200B;  * Philly gets their fearless PG scorer, unafraid to tell Embiid to get his ass in gear. * Houston gets the elite, *non-shooting*, playmaking, defensive force to go alongside ball-starved players Jalen Green and Christian Wood and Kevin Porter."
"PG: Jrue Holiday (All Star)  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovich  SF: Paul George (All Star)  PF: Kawhi Leonard (Superstar)  C: Jokic (Superstar)  Bench Dejounte Murray, G  Jalen Brunson, G  Mikal Bridges, F  Matisse Thybulle, F  Joe Ingles, F  Draymond Green, F/C  Clint Capela, C"
Not gonna happen but it would be hilarious if the Rockets ended up with all those Nets picks + Simmons + keeping their own 2021 pick in Jalen Green.
"Would Jalen Green and Wall for Simmons be too much for Houston to give up?  As good as we expect Green go be, he's still unproven and we aren't sure what he will ultimately turn into."
"You can argue about the potential of Jalen Green but the Sixers don’t need potential, they need to contend now. And Houston doesn’t need Harris or Seth, they need players with potential. So this trade could be discussed in a vacuum (where I think Houston clearly wins) but it makes zero sense in reality."
Jalen green
"Fox,Haliburton,Davion Mitchell, Jalen Green, Cade,Zion, Luka, Lamelo"
"Jalen Green, KPJ, Cade, Edwards, Lamelo, Mobley, SGA, Garland"
Jalen Green &amp; KPJ 😈
"#2 pick that was constantly being moved to different teams. Come on bro.   If jalen green has michael beasley’s career, I would be massively let downis (considering his draft pick and potential)."
Jalen Green will be better than both offensively
"Everyday, i am excited for my boy jalen green though."
jalen green? lol  hasn't even played a single NBA game yet
"My bets are on Zion, Jalen Green or Beal."
not a good sign for jalen green lol
"I think he’d have a lot more praise playing in a bigger role. Right now if you just look at his season averages, it doesn’t tell the story because he like our 10th man and isn’t a good shooter (right now).  It’s better to look at his G League averages where he played his position and played big minutes. They are comparable to what Jalen Green did last year in the G League. He averaged 18/6/4 playing as a combo guard as a 19 year old."
Jalen Green will need to change that sadly
I honestly think they should just keep him and play him at point guard. Jalen green and KPJ aren’t true point guards anyway. He just needs to take less shots.
"did they really, when they could have not given him that contract and then tried to use that cap space then to find better help for Beal? of course they didn't expect him to tear his shit up at fuckin home lol   also as bad as the Rockets were last year, I still feel like John Wall has great vision and will be very important to the development of KPJ and Jalen Green. both of those guys are lead guards who are primarily bucket getters. he'll both elevate their shots with his transition passing and I think at this stage of his career he's open to being a good vet for them.   despite what people think of, say DeRozan, he's been really huge for the development of a guy like DeJounte Murray, who went from a zero offense defense first guard to one of the five most efficient mid range iso scorers in the league last year. largely using moves I can clearly see he developed with DeMar. same goes for his passing, because he never looked much good at that before last season either. I think John Wall might be more beneficial to keep around while they're bad than some realize."
"Wall averaged 20 ppg, albeit on meh efficiency. Are you really saying he would be a net negative in a scaled back role?  Even if you play jalen green and Kpj for 30 minutes, there’s still 40 minutes per game at the guard spots"
Yeah but I’d rather let Jalen Green/Porter Jr develop and lose us games than John Wall
Running it back with Harden and Westbrook would have better championship odds than Kevin Porter and Jalen Green in the future
Even if yes it’s Harden.   A trade package for Harden is worth more than Jalen Green.
Only the most delusional Rockets fans think Jalen Green will likely turn out as good as Harden   Harden is on the borderline of generational talent
Well if I’m Houston I guess I’m happy with Jalen Green. Harden doesn’t want to play for them soooooo I think Green is better for now and the future.
Unpopular opinion to my fellow rockets fans but james harden. They drafted jalen green hoping he could become james harden.
"It’s situational:   - for Houston, people would rather watch young guys like KPJ or Jalen Green over Wall and he doesn’t add much to the entertainment value of the Rockets  - AD getting benched by the Pels when they were on the cusp of trading him was immediately called out by the league because AD was a healthy scratch and a top player in the league. Dude was pretty much the only reason to watch NOLA at that time."
Let KPJ assume the PG role and he and Jalen Green trade buckets
Ja Morant   Jalen Green   Mikael Bridges   Patrick Williams   Victor Wembanyama  And I keep the $30
"Jalen Green is probably included in any deal the Heat offer. Wall, Wood, and Green for Lowry and Butler?"
Yeah wall + jalen green seems acceptable
"Overperform:  Charlotte- Their logjam at the guard positions has been alleviated some due to Graham and Monk being gone so the lineups *should* have more consistency moving forward. Also since Graham isn’t there to take minutes away from Lamelo that should allow Lamelo to have a bigger impact on games.  Minnesota- With KAT healthy this team should be in contention for the 7th or 8th seed. They’ll be a problem especially if they get Ben Simmons without giving up any of their core  Rockets- This is a team that’s flying under the radar right now. If KPJ and Jalen Green mesh well I can see the Rockets being in contention for a play-in spot.  Cavs- People have made fun of them for the amount of bigs they have but in all seriousness they’re a legit sleeper pick for the 8th seed.  Memphis- They’re due to make a leap. This is another team that I think is gonna surprise some people this season  Underperform:  Lakers- Yea I said it😐. I think they’ll make the playoffs but it’ll be a shaky season for sure. Clippers- They had a stagnant offseason while most of the West either retooled or is due to improve. And I think it’s gonna be harder and harder for the Clippers to remain competitive as long as Kawhi is load managed.  Jazz- They greatly overperformed last season and are due to regress. Suns- Same situation as the Jazz plus CP3 is aging and it’s starting to show.  Pacers- This is a team that I think has reached their ceiling and is due to decline hard.   Teams that can go either way:  Celtics, Bulls, Wizards,"
"There’s a huge change Jalen Green is a better guard as soon as he plays a RS game.   KPJ could be better, he’s already more efficient than Wall.  Eric Gordon would probably be more valuable to pretty much every team too.  Hell at least DJ can hit a 3.   The rockets have plenty of guys to give PT to"
"I mean let's say by February Beal says he wants out of Washington. Houston can give up their next 3 first rounders+ some interesting young players to Washington, Beal can go to Denver, and MPJ can go to Houston. MPJ, Christian Wood, Jalen Green, and KPJ and not one of them are on a max yet so you can spend money in a decent FA class? Houston would be able to compete as soon as 2023. Again it's a long shot but who knows."
John Wall deserves a statue outside the Toyota center.  The best tank commander that got the rockets Jalen Green. Then now essentially benching himself so that Kevin Porter Jr can start.
"There are still times where it would make sense to play him. For example, it's hard for the bigs to get good pick-and-roll reps with a bad point guard. Wall could be paired with Sengun and Garuba while Jalen Green could be paired with Christian Wood. If it's a bunch of rookies and 2nd year players out there, that's not a good learning environment."
You got new and improved tank Commander Jalen Green
Jalen Green
"Honest question: Why WOULDN'T younger stars like LaMelo , Jalen Green, Anthony Edwards etc try to ball out in this tournament? Especially if it gives them more national TV airtime and helps build their brand??   I think people aren't seeing the vision of this... bc it can actually help young teams trying to build comradery , and also showcases up-and-coming stars in the league. Everything doesn't have to revolve around whether Lebron will participate or not.."
"Based on what? And what do you mean by European? Euroleague teams or just a random team from Germany or Turkey? Do you have any idea how many great NBA players spent time in the G League? Just this year KPJ played a good 10 games in the G league and scored 50 points in an NBA game. Do you actually think that Jordan Pool or Jalen Green are less talented than many Euroleague players. Do you have any idea what a monster Paul Reed is? Obviously the game is played differently and rules favor a different playing style but the talent level in the G league is amazing. My claim isn't that Euroleague competition isn't better (see my original comment), teams are well coached, rosters stay longer together and the motivation to play hard for the team is higher."
No such thing as Europe as it pertains to basketball. The best G league players are bench warmers in the Swedish league? Here are some of the players playing in the g league last year: Kevin Porter Jr.  Jalen Green   jordan Poole.  Paul Reed.  Jared Harper.  Henry Ellenson.  Jeremy Lin.  Nico Manion.  Oshae Brissett.  Kobi Simmons.  KJ Martin.  Jalen Adams.  Vernon Carey jr Antonio Blakeney.   Any of these players can play for top European clubs. Some would dominate. Some actually signed with European clubs and many more were called up to the NBA. Some were sent for development and played a good 10-15 games.
"But being bad on purpose is the whole purpose of the trade, getting a good not great player + picks would have gotten straight to mediocrity.  Building a 45 wins team around Simmons or a 40 wins team around Leveert and Allen was the absolute worst thing they could've done. Simmons is on a max contract, Allen is overpaid now, Levert is meh, with those 3 + Wall and Wood they would've almost been a tax team, and none of those guys have insane trade value.  They got Jalen Green, and will be bad until OKC gets their picks, this timeline is way better than being mediocre, with meh/bad contracts on player with little upside"
"Kyrie, Zion, Giannis sometimes, Steph has done similar too Jalen Green is someone that does this very well but he hasnt played yet"
This is what Jalen green bring to Houston
Ignoring? You kidding me? It's fucking summer league   It's his job to prove it in the regular season   He's not a super hyped prospect like Jalen Green   He won't get or deserve that notoriety till he proves more in real game time
"Those aren’t correlations, they’re coincidental. Playing against g leaguers fighting for nba contracts and rookies doesn’t show how a player will perform in the nba in any way shape or form.   Ayton is a great defender tf ?  Which areas he excelled in doesn’t make it any less of a small sample so that’s a weird point to mention.   And idk why you’re acting like he dominated when he put up an inefficient 14/11 over a four game sample. Cam Thomas outplayed that. Jalen green. Tre Jones. Omer yurtseven. And while we’re at it let’s look at some past players to further prove my point. 2015-2016, Alan Williams dominated and went on to be a fringe rotational guy and then out of the league. Noah vonleh played extremely well too. Meanwhile all star KAT struggled a lot. The next year? Trey Lyles and Kris Dunn were the summer league stars. What incredible careers they’ve had. 2017-2018? Bryn Forbes dominated. Lonzo ball was electric. Guys like Quinn cook, troy Williams, Wayne selden, Dennis smith jr and Deandre Bembry were all excellent. Meanwhile guys like bam and fox struggled. 2018-2019? Malik monk and josh hart stole the show. Ante zizic dominated too. Cheick diallo was a real standout too. But guys like Trae young were awful. 2019-2020?NAW, anfernee Simons, Tony Bradley and drew Eubanks killed it. Meanwhile RJ Barrett sucked.  Summer league means nothing"
"Oh that’s a somewhat different question than the one in your post. There sometimes is a player (Zion a few years ago) who can come into the league and be a top 50 player instantly, but I would say the 10 best college basketball players would be like ranked mostly 100-300 if you rate them with NBA players. I believe Cade probably would be ranked around 70th (it’s a long list so that’s just my estimate - for reference Westbrook is around 35 and Draymond is around 45 and Rozier is probably around 70). After Cade, the next best college basketball players are probably going to be ranked 100+ (Jalen Green might be ranked 90-100, if you include G leaguers). Davion Mitchell might be the most NBA ready college prospect not named Cade or Green, and he’s probably around 120.   Btw this answer would be way different 20 years ago and definitely 40 years ago when college basketball players weren’t all one and dones. When MJ came into the league in 1984, MJ would have already been a top 5 player (he lead the league in total points as a rookie). Hakeem would have been a top 15 player and Barkley and Perkins probably both top 50 players."
"Kyrie, Ibaka, Jalen green, Blake griffin, MPJ  Trae young take is borderline egregious."
"We didn’t disappear, just took a hiatus  You’re gonna remember how annoying we are again during the Jalen Green ROTY campaign"
"Wish you had better insights than “hater” but oh well beggars can’t be choosers. Based off of upside alone, (which is not how drafting goes) yes you’re probably taking THT. Still upside wise however you are taking the following over Talen Horton Tucker  Cade, Green, Mobley, Barnes, Suggs, Kuminga, Wagner, Mitchell, Ziare, Bouknight, Giddey, Sengun, Moody, Cam Thomas, Trey Murphy, Jalen Johnson, Keon Johnson, Kai Jones, Shariffe Cooper and maybe even JT Thor. So for THT the highest he gets picked is 20"
Are you taking THT over Jalen Green?
Cmon bruh. He put up bigger stats in less minutes than Jalen Green did in the G-League too.
I can imagine Jalen Green bitching about the sand in his hair already lmao.
I'd feel he'd end up being better than Jalen Green.
There are plenty somebodys that have to in this rockets team tho  Jalen Green  KPJ  Wood  All get the touches ahead of Sengun
"It’s pretty weird to look back at peoples opinions when he was drafted.  It’s just arguing about who’s going to be best between Okafor, Embiid and Noel.  Basketball is strange like that, some people thought Okafor was the best prospect in 2015 and hindsight tells us you’d rather have Cam Payne who was drafted at 14 than have Okafor.  It’s just really weird.  Like can you guys imagine if 6 years from now were like “wow it’s no wonder Jalen Green is out of the league.  I would have even rather had Moses Moody.” It just feels totally alien today even though this sort of thing could happen again."
if they include  Jalen Green and some picks.
Rockets would have to throw in Jalen Green for this trade to work
Jalen Green and Alperen Sengun come to mind
"&gt;\9. Jalen Green averages an efficient 20ppg in his rookie year and wins ROTY by a landslide, Alperen Sengun is also an All-Rookie team member.  Inject this straight into my veins"
I think they’re like the second favourites for the title. This reminds me of Jalen Green having a chip on his shoulder for going #2 and not #1 lol
There is a very good chance that Jalen Green will be a big improvement over the guys who he is replacing (Victor Oladipo and Sterling Brown)
Eh. I mean Jalen Green can win ROY and still be an average NBA starter. John Wall can be 31 and still be a below average NBA starter.
"Thybulle is a weird guy to call overrated, but sure.  I agree an Tatum. I feel like he's Danny Granger 2.0 (both players awesome).  I agree on the talent part, but not the overall product.  Screenshotted the Jalen Green take as I want you to get full credit when you turn out correct.  You may be right on Kyrie. Not really sure to be honest.  COMPLETELY AGREE about Butler and the Sixers."
Jalen green
"So Jalen Green is also 6'8"" with shoes? Assuming his 6'6"" measurement is also barefoot?"
Jalen Green is 6'4 with a 2-inch afro.
Thybulle is an overrated gimmick defender  Tatum is a perennial all-star but won't ever be good enough to be the best player on a championship team - Paul George 2.0  The talent and overall product in the NBA has never been better  Jalen Green will force his way to the Lakers at some point during his second contract  Kyrie Irving is one of the best human beings in the NBA  Sixers' championship window closed as soon as they lost Butler
"I mean on the contrary some guys are bigger than projected. Jalen Green was supposedly 6’5 but then the Rockets listed him as 6’6, the same as Cade. In comparison to Green who was 6’5 and for Cade to be advertised at 6’6, for them to be the same height is pretty disappointing lol."
"If I were a betting person, I'd put $1 on Jalen Green. Dude is going to have one of the greenest (lol) lights in history. Would not surprise me if the rockets let him shoot 30 times a game."
" Danny Green, Draymond Green, Gerald Green, Jalen Green, JaMychal Green"
"Nah there's like 12 players younger than him now, including Giddey, Kuminga, Sengun, and Jalen Green"
"If you've got a young star guard that's already going to make you too good to be a bottom-feeder, maybe it makes sense  Like if Jalen Green and Sengun look great as Rockets and the offense is dynamite but the defense is a disaster ... maybe you get Simmons at the deadline. You got what you needed out of the draft, you can't tank anyway, maybe you think he is the missing piece"
"MVP: Jayson Tatum (yeah you probably think I’m crazy but I saw multiple guys say Trae young so this seems justified)   MIP: Jordan Poole  6moty: Dennis Schroder, I mean a lot of people have been shitting on him and just acting like he is a bad player so I think he’s gonna try and prove everyone wrong  DPOY: as much as I hate him Ben Simmons   ROTY; Cade Cunningham or Jalen Green"
"I’ll cast my vote for the Rockets, if we’re counting the draft. A team that was incredibly awful last year, setting one of the longest losing streaks in league history, re-tooled with four supremely exciting rookies in Jalen Green, Alpheren Sengun, Josh Christopher, and Usman Garuba. Considering how the Rockets were the league’s most moribund team after the Harden trade, with a core of Kelly Olynyk and washed Wall, to have one of the league’s best young cores (those four + KPJ + Tate) less than a year later actually gives Rockets fans some hope for the future."
"Depends on what version of Wall from last year we talk about.  He was very good on both ends until the Harden trade, then fell off defensively after the trade, then when Wood got hurt he legit was absolutely terrible for a long stretch, maybe one of the most negative player in the NBA and they can thank him for Jalen Green. Then at the end of the year he was back to being okay offensively.  &amp;#x200B;  I think he can still be a starting point guard for a good team, his catch and shoot numbers are average-ish, he can hold up defensively when he wants to, he's still a very good passer in transition. But I'm not sure he can be effective in the pick and roll anymore, teams have gotten way more extreme and good at the drop/going under combo to force this kind of player (kinda like Westbrook) into a jumper, problem being that while Westbrook is at least average at that shot, Wall is a terrible mid range shooter"
"This is why so many rockets fans are also hype for drafting Alpi after Jalen green. . While not the euro league, dude was MVP of Turkish league as a teenager and balled out of his mind in the summer league. Right place, right time, every single time"

"Jalen Green, Josh Christopher, Alperen SengÜn, Usman Garuba, and one of the forwards from the top-10 picks of the 2022 NBA draft."
"JA Morant, Jalen Green, and Josh Giddey"
Jalen Green will finally get to come to Detroit like he said he wanted to so badly!
"I had Mobley at 1, Cade 2, Jalen Suggs 3, and then Barnes Green 4-5. I think Cade is being a bit overlooked with the whole hasn't played yet thing but he's got a unique set of skills only Mobley can match from this class"
FTs are a part of the game so I agree his amount of FTs helps him just as any other top scorers.  Although it’s ridiculous some people think he exaggerates contact for all 10 FTs a game when he actually got fouled a lot on drives  I remember an old stat that he was always top 3 I drives per game from his mega scoring seasons few years ago.. refs are enforcing the new rules which is great of course but it seems like they are missing fouls on just about everyone right now.. I’ve watched multiple games already where players are getting mauled and no whistle lol  Ex: Jalen Green got slapped in the face when he went for a poster and it wasn’t even a regular foul lmao
"Story of the draft class IMO.  Jalen Green, Mobley, Barnes, Duarte, Giddey all look a bit ahead of schedule.  We haven't even seen Cade yet either lol"
"&gt; The 2nd Harden trade also will be remembered as bad a return as any team got for a superstar but we can cross that bridge in due time.  Probably wouldn't have Jalen Green if they had taken a win-now player like Simmons (jokes aside), instead of mostly just picks from the Nets.  This trade is not nearly as bad as the first Harden trade, which is IMO the worst trade ever and when Presti gets a ton of praise as a great GM, it's the first thing I think of."
"To be fair, a big reason why they don’t want to play him is because they already have KPJ, Jalen Green, and Eric Gordon.   By playing Wall you are taking minutes away from guys you are developing, and Gordon who is a lot easier to trade."
"As a Thunder fan I went from wanting Jalen Green, then lotto happened and I was so excited for Scottie, now currently I think Thunder found their perfect guy in Giddey. So funny lol This draft class is loaded"
"Cade imo was the clear number 1, but if anyone could have given him a run for his money it was Mobley.  People just love stereotyping draft players - Mobley is a big and hes skinny and he's projected top 3 = he must be raw and have a high bust potential. You don't even have to watch full games of him, hell just search ""Mobley scouting report"" or ""Mobley highlights"" to see him do stuff that simply isn't normal for a 19 year old. Or are still stuck in the mindset of ""vet min bigs are all you need"" never mind that two centers finished top 3 in MVP voting last season and so many of the best teams from the last few years had great centers.  As a rockets fan I'm still excited for Jalen Green and think he'll be very good but man do I wish we had Mobley instead"
Most rooks are like Jalen Green who only help on O. I think its more interesting to watch Mobley help and improve a defense immediately
"It helps but theres no rookie playing better than him atm, maybe mobley. Both are outplaying my boy jalen green"
"After the Lakers game (I'm biased but I think he probably should have been the 5 already), Giddey is easily in the top 5 if jumped ahead of Jalen Green."
Jalen Green is like if Ja Morant and Anthony Edwards had a love child.
"They have played like 5 games man. Sports is usually about hyperbole, but a lot of these takes will look very bad in 5 years.    A guy like Tyreke Evans looked like a monster in his rookie season in 2009 cause he was already physically built like a grown man.   He could pass, had good ball skills and could attack the paint. Harden, Derozan, Curry did not look as capable. Although with Curry he improved in the second half of the season.   I believe Jalen Green has Kobe like potential. Not like for like, but someone with that type of explosive ability in the modern game.   It will take him time to develop. He needs a lot of polish and needs to build strength, but he is the only one that looks like a legit superstar talent to me IMO.   Barnes and Mobley look like future all-stars and will def be factors in teams winning championships cause they have such great intangibles, plus the versatility on defense."
"Think the odds moved a bit after Jalen Green had a huge game and Mobley also continued to do big numbers. Duarte has been good too and Cade hasn’t even played yet so by all accounts this is a pretty open race, who knows what it’s going to look like by mid season."
Jalen green and giddy too
"Just be patient with him and ignore the ""JALEN GREEN'S A BUST"" posts that will inevitably come from trolls when he has some classical bad rookie games.  Hyper athletic guards take a while to get used to the pace &amp; schemes of the league but once they do they progress exponentially quick.  Off the top of my head Mitchell is another guy who had a similar learning curve as Edwards and it's probably gonna be the same for Green."
"Doesn't matter. I'd probably take Scottie over every Jalen in the NBA **combined**.  Suggs, McDaniels, Green, you name it."
Saw Jalen green get slapped in the face on a dunk attempt. Was clear as day now whistle. Harden only has a handful of free throws attempts too if I’m not mistaken.
Jalen green getting slapped across the face on that attempted monster dunk. Think it was in their second game
"There are some Rocket fans that will tell you that trade led them to getting Jalen Green.  So... being forced to tank to the #2 pick now counts as part of the trade, that's how underwhelming the actual returns were."
"Not to compare or anything, but aren't other rookies getting frequent free throws? Maybe it's because the way jalen green plays(the way he moves his body), not because he is a rookie."
If I were one half of Jalen Green I'd be
If I was half as mature as Jalen Green at 19 years old I'd be a lot more successful
"Fox is fastest with the ball, Green is fastest without the ball  I think overall explosiveness is Jalen Green or Edwards  Ja is probably the quickest (might just appear so because he has the best handle though)  Ant's advantage over all these guys is he's way stronger and has a better frame"
Jalen Green will be a demon the second he gains 10-15 more pounds.
Then there’s Jalen Green who hasn’t gotten to the line in 4 games.
"Can anyone convince me not to drop porzingis in fantasy right now?   My whole roster is high risk high reward(Zion, Irving, jalen green, mpj, kp) but I just don’t feel like dealing with this guy. Even when he’s healthy he gets taken out of games too easily.   I see Mobley, Rubio, and Adams as free agents…."
Jalen Green will be a top 5 SG in 5 years
Jalen Green shooting like playoff Russell Westbrook
I think Houston hit on Jalen Green. Not entirely sure what his ceiling is but he seems like a solid scorer for the team going forward. I like that as a rookie he seems capable of making his own shot
"What are Simmons, Lavine and Jalen Green? PGs?  Ja, Fox gotta be up there. And obviously Russ too. So I’d say whatever order you have it you have to have those 6 at the top"
"It’s an unpopular nba opinion thread so I’ll take the downvotes, lol.  LA, NY, MIA would not always have cap space. Jalen Green wouldn’t sign a minimum or small deal with the Lakers/Clippers. He probably wouldn’t sign with Miami to get a smaller deal either, not if any other team had top money guaranteed. Agents would 100% get top unproven 19 y/o rookies to an Indiana or OKC if the playing time and money was there. If they don’t wanna go, that should be their choice just like I have the choice to choose my employer. Top rookies would theoretically want the biggest bag and the biggest opportunity to play, win ROY, build their career and fighting for minutes with veteran led teams on minimum contracts wouldn’t be ideal for anybody. Tanking would be out the window and organizations would quickly improve their management as a Jalen Green type talent is no longer a given. Pacers would be just fine, also it’s literally never gonna happen so it’s a fun 2K dream association scenario."
I've hated the Rockets my whole life and I hate that Jalen Green is gonna the first player for y'all I truly love since Tmac
"Jalen Green just gave em a 30 bomb on good efficiency too lol, 3rd NBA game as well"
Unique?  Jalen Green would like a word
I’m fairly confident Jalen Green will win ROY
Lol mf brought up Harden when he was talking about Jalen Green 💀
"I think refs are also just calling less genuine fouls. I agree with the new rules completely, but I've watched Jalen Green get pummeled in the paint multiple times and he's yet to shoot a free throw. It's bad for player safety, and something I have a problem with."
"Jalen Green.  You won’t find them on Reddit, you’ll have to search for them on Instagram and at AAU circuits his fans are closeted for him."
Respect Jalen Green
"Virgin: “scoTTie bArneS”  Chad: Jalen Green, Houston Rockets.... Evan Mobley, Cleveland Cavaliers. ... Scottie Barnes, Toronto Raptors. ... Jalen Suggs, Orlando Magic. ... Josh Giddey, Oklahoma City Thunder. ... Franz Wagner, Orlando Magic. ... Davion Mitchell, Sacramento Kings. ... Ziaire Williams, Memphis Grizzlies."
Jalen Green lol
"I’m not exactly sure how Jalen Green has a higher ceiling than Mobley, or how Kuminga has a higher ceiling than Barnes or Cade? Please elaborate."
Jalen Green-Evan Mobley-Giddey-Kuminga highest ceiling
Don’t know who’s more athletic between him and Jalen green
KD miles bridges kelly oubre and ja morant HM: Jalen Green
Pretty much but at least Harden was in his last year. But that was a bitch move imo too and Houston didn’t really get anything for Harden. They got Oladipo and let him go. They were gonna be a bad team regardless so I don’t count Jalen Green as something they got for giving up Harden
"Right?  It's still so early.  So many hot takes on our sub about Jalen Green after two single digit games...but then he drops an incredibly efficient 30, and now his numbers look good on the year.  Add in Scottie Barnes looking great along with Giddie...and Cade hasn't even played yet, and Suggs isn't going to be this bad for long.  Add on guys like Sengun (who has looked great at times but still very raw) and this draft is going to look wonderful in 4 or 5 years.  Going into the year I thought Mobley would be like, 6th or 7th on my most likely to win RotY because of how raw he is compared to Cade, Barnes, Suggs, and Green...but even with that he just looks so smooth on the court.  I've been so incredibly impressed by him, but he absolutely does *not* have RotY locked down by any stretch."
Who's your way-too-early all-rookie team? I got   Chris Duarte / Jalen Green / Josh Giddey / Scottie Barnes / Evan Mobley
Wouldn't Jalen Green have to be Kevin Durant in order to break Kevin Durant's career high for threes?
"If Jalen Green was leading the league in points through 3 games or Cade assists, people would be losing their minds. He’s leading the league in maybe the single most important defensive stat by a wide margin.  I think he has like 66 and the next closest person is in the mid40s. Most of the people on the list are dudes you’d expect.  He’s already an elite rim defender that can legitimately guard 1-5"
"I know you think you're being clever here but you're really just making an idiotic assumption that's not really backed by anything outside of the few games of these guys you actually watch. You clearly know nothing about any of these players and don't pay attention to scouting that's been going on for well over 6 years so I'm not sure why you'd even involve yourself in the conversation. Jalen Green has put up elite numbers on elite efficiency for his entire career so I'm not sure where you got the term ""chucking"" from like he's Jerry Stackhouse or something. It's extremely likely he will be a &gt;25ppg scorer on incredible efficiency for the foreseeable future which smokes everyone else on that list.   Jalen has been getting compared to Kobe for over 5 years and has been the driving reason, along with Cade and Mobley for why this draft has been circled on every GM's calendar as the best draft of the past 10 years for years now. Nothing that has happened since the draft has changed this assumption whatsoever, despite how much you want to believe that the front offices are going to ditch 6 years of scouting to select inferior players because they've started an 82-game season well for the first three games. Not to mention, Green has been exactly as advertised since being drafted."
It hasn't stuck yet but let's push 'ZeroG' for Jalen Green.
I'd go   evan mobley   scottie barnes  jalen green  chris duarte  josh giddey
"You know what truth. Don't be afraid to say it.  He tried it 20 times, and failed every single time. Years on years he tries every now and then, and yet 8 threes elude him like the Canadian Lynx.  Jalen Green tried it 1 time, and succeeded immediately. Truth is your friend, do not resist it."
"Isn’t it same with Harden too? Now they have Jalen Green, KPJ, Sengun and draft picks"
Who also has made 9 threes in a quarter which is 1 more than Jalen Green made in a whole game. Discuss
Steph's first MVP season was 2014-15.  Jalen Green turned 13 that season.   These kids grew up watching Steph and Klay and modeled their games after his. These ridiculous 3PM stats will just keep climbing unless they move the line back.
Clearly Jalen Green &gt; KD
I saw jalen green play last night and Houston is pretty set for the future with him and KPJ and a million nets picks. Guarantee a couple of those nets picks will be gold in several years with KD's age and kyrie being the way he is. It's way better than Harden aging out on his contract on a capped out team going nowhere fast and leaving for nothing in free agency
"Nah I thought Jalen Green would be better, easily as a scorer but Cade was more well-rounded."
Jalen green is starting to look like a big guard with PG skills too (not very similar to Luka tho)
"What's more impressive is Adam's no-rim touch, no-look dunk.  2022 All-star dunk champ, sorry Jalen Green."
Jalen Green and Scottie Barnes have entered the chat.
"Rockets fans, one quick question: Why on Earth was Daniel Theis guarding Tatum? Of all people, why Theis? I thought Tate was the Rockets' best defender.  Also, Jalen Green is fun. This rookie crop have a lot of highlight type of players. Can't wait to see Cade joining the group, the ROY race will be good. Ma boi Sengun again was great.   Hope Green burned his heat and have a quiet game on Tuesday."
or at least wear one of those headbands that gathers it towards the back of his head. Kind of like what Jalen Green wears.
"This pick was honestly an anomaly.   Players at 19 should not have that kind of footwork Jalen has already.   I think because of his crazy athleticism many people expect him to be raw, but didn't quite expect the offensive polish and mature shooting. Honestly, those types of players commonly don't have those kind of skills because they've relied on raw athleticism at every level.  Jalen actually has those skills at 19. I don't remember the last time I've seen a rookie hit the Olajuwon/Kobe pivot fadeaways off the dribble, yet Jalen has that in his arsenal. Some players who have been in the league for over a decade can't pull that off.  So when you say ""prime"" that's about 8 years from now.  If Green stays healthy I really don' know what to expect if he's doing what he's doing right now as his floor."

Houston won the rookie draft. Jalen Green and Alperen Sengun 🔥🔥🔥
I told yall anybody that passed on Jalen Green would regret it. But let's give Cade a chance to clap back
"Green is faster and more explosive. Ja is quicker and actually plays more smooth than explosive. I think with his amazing dunks people view Ja as purely an explosive player. Jalen has that, I can go off and get 60 type of explosiveness. Haven't seen that since young Kobe."
"Cade: Grant Hill is a better comp. Both are smart, unselfish, and offensively versatile players who gave a damn on both ends. But neither were A+ athletes like the way Penny was.     Green has a higher ceiling than Lavine if he hits. Athletically, I think Green is more explosive slashing, while Lavine's athleticism is really his bounce. Green has also shown way more passing intuition than Lavine did until maybe the past year or so. Hard to compare a guy to MJ/Kobe, but he's definitely higher than Lavine.     Mobley: I wonder if there's a better comp than Bosh. Both are talented on both ends of the floor and are long as all out. But Mobley's passing skills are really impressive, not something I've ever seen from Bosh. I might argue ""KG without the f\*cking intens\*ty"" for Mobley.  If Scottie Barnes hits, he could be AK-47. (How's that for cross-race comparisons)     Jalen Suggs: Jameer Nelson 2.0, except Jameer shot it better.     Giddey: Kukoc is not the comp I would go with given that one of Kukoc's hallmarks was his shooting ability and Giddey still has very big ??? about his shot. There's got to be a better comp."
"Jalen ""Gerald"" Green."
We need that Jalen Green release in 2k
True Jalen Green doubled Harden’s points today
"Jalen Green is more efficient, this is disrespectful."
Yeah I saw it with Jalen green tonight. He clearly got fouled multiple times with no call.  I like it as long as it’s consistent and league wide
"He’s not basing it off only 3 games tho? He literally said he led his team to the playoffs, bounced steph in the play in game with 35/6/6/4 and averaged 30/8 in his first playoff series. If he said something like is jalen green a top 10 player cause of tonight alright but he gave explanation  lmao. Idk tho maybe we not reading the same thing"
Jalen Green built by Lumpia.
"Jalen Green is an absurd athlete you won't find me arguing that.  But prime LeBron was just different. From 07-13 he was the kind of athlete that transcended sports. People said shit like he would be the greatest TE ever if he wanted to play football instead. Other athletes like Westbrook and Sean Kemp and Dominique transcended their era as athletes, not entire sports like Bron."
There are a dozen players who jump higher amd change speeds quicker than Lebron and Wilt. They don't get a bonus for their size. Jalen Green is quicker than almost every PG despite being a 6' 5 SG.
Woke talk. It's obvious Jalen Green is by far the most talented and only one with legit superstar potential. The rest are at best all star level. Green is going to lead the league in scoring in his prime and has potential to be a great defender too. All up to him
"Hmm tried a long time to find a full court fast break Ja, found this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J7O0UjmMMw&amp;t=422s   compare to Jalen Green:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RIJgOzjaKU   View sync (tried to view them at the same time starting from the same position) https://viewsync.net/watch?v=0RIJgOzjaKU&amp;t=3.6&amp;v=0J7O0UjmMMw&amp;t=424&amp;mode=solo&amp;autoplay=false  From what I can tell Green is slightly faster. His legs look like bicycle wheels  once he gets the ball, and his legs + strides are longer"
"The amount of highlights posted would have you believe the Rockets were winning. Not that I mind, some of that Jalen Green stuff was niiiiiice"
Those are some Jalen Green level stats 🔥🔥🔥
Yeah bro I love jalen green ive been telling everyone hes gonna best the best player in the draft but if he thinks hes more athletic than prime bron he didnt watch him whatsoever 😂
Off night just had a great game against the dubs too 22 points on 9/16 3/8 from 3. So hyped about this class. Jalen Green went off for 30 too on 8/10 from 3.
"He will, he's gonna murder dudes at the G League or play himself into the rotation, but him and Green are two peas in a pod, and Josh will definitely be hungry watching Jalen succeed."
Bruh do you deadass think Jalen Green won't improve from this year lmao
Yeah took a brief look through his comment history to see how much he's been talking about Jalen Green and yeesh I don't have enough brain power to hate on someone I don't even know like that
Nah bro don't tell me about Houston fans tell me about Jalen Green and how he's gonna be trash
Bro why do you fucking hate Jalen Green lmao I saw you in some other thread talking about how he only had one good game like he's not a rookie
"Harden is a Top 10 SG in NBA history, possibly as high as #4. Jalen Green being as good as Jordan or Kobe is the spiciest of spicy hot takes."
props to stone for firing harden and shipping his ass outta here when he started getting old and crappy.  Jalen Green and the rockets future &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quitting fat guy
jalen green made it happen
It was reverse psychology! No I was just high and being an idiot when I made the thread. Tonight I'm high expect its just on jalen green.
I need 48 minutes of Jalen Green and Ja Morant trying to dunk on the other 8 guys on the floor for every single possession.
who will return from hamstring first.  booker or jalen green?
Isn’t that Jalen Green?
"Giddey is the only rook who I've seen way overpraised. Not that he's been garbage, but even his hot start in October he was putting up 11/6/6 on shit efficiency in 30 minutes a game on a losing team. And you'd still see his statline with 1k on the frontpage. Maybe a little too much Sengun buzz but he's been pretty solid.  Cade, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs are struggling on brutal teams and if anything we should be talking more about how well Mobley and Barnes are playing."
"They had the draft position at #2, and took Jalen Green instead. Who honestly is a great young prospect but..."

"You mean the one guy, Jalen Green? Maybe maybe Sengun?"
The Rockets are -249 in 555 minutes with Jalen Green on the floor.   -107 in 469 minutes is child's play.
Dunk contest:   Anthony Edwards  GP2  Miles Bridges   Jalen Green
"KPJ has the 3rd most TO in the league on a very bad assist to turnover ratio, and his defence is not good. Him and Jalen Green are easily the worst defensive back court in the league.  Would you rather have Lu Dort or KPJ?"
"What's funnier, Kabesa, is that Jalen Green seems to have a birthmark on his ass."
Jalen Green most likely. KPJ possibly. Alp Sengun definitely possible.
Jalen Green has been out/injured for 3 games
"Fair question, as a Rockets fan here's what I've seen. The issue has been spacing. It was absolutely horrible. Jalen definitely has the talent to be a better shooter than what we've seen so far, but he definitely hasn't been getting the greatest looks. When the lineup offers more space he has looked much better.   Jalen Green, Theis, and Tate together has been really bad for that spacing. That was combined with KPJ playing point guard for the first time AND starting. Basically a shit situation for good play making. And Theis has also clearly been hindering Christian Woods abilities.  I think Jalen Green will be alright coming back. Especially because the Rockets can have such a speed advantage, and Jalen is among the fastest I've ever seen.  Would like to see him in a rotation to pair with Sengun, and shooters like Gordon and Brooks."
"Don’t want to shit on a rookie. But everyone is blaming Theis being out for this turnaround, but couldn’t it be that Jalen Green isn’t playing. Especially since he has the worst +/- in the entire league??"
Pelicans avoiding playing through Jonas has reached Jalen Green levels
"Unfortunately, Griffin is having an atrocious season.  The people in the league who are having a season like his are Bazley, Killian Hayes, Avery Bradley, Jalen Suggs, Porter Jr., and Jalen Green.  I mean, Theis lost his job with the Rockets who don't seem to be trying to win much and he's probably been slightly better than Griffin.  Despite winning, the Nets might have even been better without Griffin's minutes."
I'm not surprised if the dudes who gave the jalen green injury report thread a laughing award was from the teams of the top draft picks this year
"Honestly I didn't think it would be this big of an impact, I knew it would help a little but wow this has been a surprise. Hopefully Jalen Green can use this new spacing as a way to show everyone his true talents."
Can't wait for JALEN GREEN to come back and be part of this lineup
Jalen Green is the true tank commander
"Watch a couple games with Jalen Green out then.  KPJ has played quite a bit better.  For some reason Silas wanted us running a ton of iso while Jalen Green was playing, but since he went out we've fallen back on more pnr play that suits our roster well.  Hopefully when Jalen Green is back we will keep up the strategy that's helped us win the last two!"
"KPJ looking a lot better the last two games with Jalen Green out.  Averaging  10.5 assists with over a 2-to-1 assist to turnover ratio.  He does need to reduce TOs still and figure out how to make it work with Jalen Green in.  I think the biggest problem early in the season was HOU's reluctance to run pnr with Wood in favor of running iso for Jalen Green, which never made sense to me.  Hopefully KPJ can keep it up and continue to improve once Jalen Green is back.  He also needs to improve decision making, especially late in games.  Twice against the Hornets he attempted to get us a bucket late in the game when he should have been pulling it out to waste time - it caused the game to go to OT and then almost cost us the game in OT.  He's young tho, the poor decisions are expected."
"Rockets are playing a lot better without Theis and Jalen Green, and are shooting lights out 47% from three."
"The shade thrown at Jalen Green in the first part of the Rockets section is pretty unwarranted. We've done well in the past two games because Theis is out of the rotation and we have good spacing, not because Green is out. Green was crushing it in that Bulls game before he left (11 pts in 11 min). He needed that additional spacing just as much as our other players."
Jalen Green has a worse on/off in more minutes.
"It is not shit at all, the only other pointguards worst than Russ in the league are:  - Kemba (no more a starting pg) - Jalen Green - Jalen  Suggs - Cade  - Graham - Monte Morris - Reggie Jackson - Aaron Holiday  That's it. You could argue about Dennis Scrotum also been worst than Russ, but at least he seems more adaptable. And also Lowry is playing bad for now. Anyway if Russ isn't in the worst 10 PG is for sure below average (aka been worst 15).   And that's a fact, if you are dumb I cannot do anything about that."
If the FO decides to move away from the KPJ at the point experiment then you might as well pair Jalen Green with a competent ball handler.
If the FO decides to move away from the KPJ at the point experiment then you might as well pair Jalen Green with a competent ball handler.
"He can have the green light and still be a tank commander. Did that well last season.  There's the whole argument of ""let the younger guys develop"" but if the FO thinks that KPJ will never be a true point guard then you might as well put a competent one around Jalen Green."
"Shooting better from three then Cade,Green and Jalen Busts"
I thought a big problem was how often Jalen Green was shut out of the offence.
Jalen Green
"There are not set rules but there is precedence.   Realistically what matters is that AD is a player people bought tickets to see and watch games for. No one is doing that for Wall on the Rockets. However, people are buying tickets and tuning into to watch young players. Whether it is Rockets fans to see the development or Pistons/Cavs/Raptors fans tuning in to criticize Jalen Green.   As I've stated before too, the Rockets are arguably a better team with KPJ starting at point guard. His turnovers are down when the Rockets don't run a double big lineup as he has more space to play make.   The Rockets will play him off the bench in place of DJ Augustin, who he is better than. It's Wall's choice now. Come off the bench or take a buyout."
"Here’s the truth. The rockets are being very sus this season. Reports came in of Stone (GM) having his say on lineups. This was after he went out and drafted Daniel Theis in offseason to be a defensive anchor. So under Stones influence Silas was forced to try and run a two big lineup that killed all of our spacing. Our rookies aren’t all sharpshooters so of course they need the spacing.   Two games ago we dropped the two big lineup, beat the bulls, then just last night beat the hornets with another only 1 big lineup.   To mw it seems like they were trying to figure it out and it just ended up resulting in a hard tank. Now, they look like a completely different team.   Kpj just put up 20 pts and 12 assists on 3TO and Jalen green had his best quarter scoring 11 in a quarter before getting injured.   If they go back to that lineup they may be horrible, but I really think they just commited to the tank and tricked everyone. Time will tell, cuz you can’t fake bad turnovers and FT issues which were some of their other issues."
Should change his name to Jalen Green so he’ll get lots of minutes…😏
"He’s definitely been better than green this season. Sengun is always impactful when he plays, where green is Lowkey useless when his shot isn’t falling.   This being said, I could still see jalen green becoming better than sengun in a few years."
Then let the kid foul out. The team is so bad right now it's not like it could get worse. Also absolute turkeys in defense like Kevin porter Jr and Jalen green are still getting minutes. It doesn't make sense that Sengun is the only young player who needs to earn his minutes while those other 2 are getting them while dogging it out there.
Jalen Green has a birthmark on his ass.
"It's pretty early so I don't think it's fair to call him a bust yet but...he looks pretty for a 3rd overall pick who some where saying should have been taken 1st overall...     He's a pylon on defense, absolutely useless on that end, his handle hasn't looked as good as advertised, his playmaking and facilitating is pretty bas as well, and although he's explosive he lacks the strength drive to the rim in traffic...quite frankly if he wasn't the 3rd overall pick and his name wasn't Jalen Green I don't think he would get nearly as many touches as he does and he would probably be riding the pine      His upside is still high, I mean the kid is only 19 and there is no doubt he is talented but talent can only take you so far....he's going to really have to bust his ass in the offseason to become something special, lets just hope he has that work ethic and drive in him..."
"That was without Jalen Green playing too, jeez"
"I would have to say Scottie has the most linear improvement which is to develop a shot. In that sense he has the easiest path to becoming great. However, easier said then done. Look at how many times Giannis keeps trying to develop his shot and is still struggling(too bad coaching staff fucked up his shot form after his rookie year).  Jalen Green needs improvement on the decision making end. This is easy as it comes with experience. However, he needs to put on muscle cause with his build he will be at best an outside scorer.  Cade is probably the toughest of the 3 because his issue is not something you can just solve with developing a shot or putting on muscle. His speed is just not up to par for an NBA point guard. You can't just suddenly become faster. This issue is going to plague him as a playmaker if defenses play close and catch up if he drives.  If I had to choose between Scottie and Green, then I'd pick Green because 4 years of experience and putting on muscle sounds the easiest to me. If it were the sophomore year, then I would choose Scottie."
Or since Jalen Green got injured. - player basically every time he is on the court.
"Well I'm sorry to tell you, jalen green does not contribute to winning right now, and his on/off stats suggest the rockets are worse with him on the court compared to theis"
"What makes no sense is saying Jalen sucked worse than Theis. Having watched Rockets games, everything OP has said about spacing is accurate. Running the two big lineups negatively affected our spacing and prevented our shooters from being effective. This has directly correlated to our 15 game losing streak that was snapped with taking Theis out the lineup. Green is raw yes, but Theis has been much worse for our team’s success"
No jalen green either and KPJ came back last game key piece
"The two aren't even comparable but I'm sure it helps you to feel your 3rd win of the season to be justified, anyways enjoy your your next first round pick, couldn't be a worse choice than Jalen Green"
"Love Jalen and would trade W's to have him back on the court, but having somebody who can consistently go 3/7 on open shots is huge for our ability to open up the court elsewhere. Teams were happy to leave Theis and Green open, now they're getting punished cause we're playing real shooters."
Theis is bad but he was nowhere near the anchor that was Jalen Green.
So Jalen Green was the problem
"Tbf I haven't watched any Rockets ball because why would I want to do that this year but based on their roster and what NBA media guys like KOC and Lowe have said, there's no way for guys like Jalen Green, Kevin Porter Jr., and Christian Wood to learn how to play winning NBA basketball when DJ Augustin is the only veteran pg playing"
Was  Jalen green holding KPJ back? /s
Jalen Green was the problem ofc lol
Jalen green has played like 20 games and is already tired with the rockets lmao
He should play just so Jalen Green doesn’t get accustomed to losing
"Originally I figured Jalen Green though seems he’s struggling a bit, Cade seems very good but I worry about Evan Turner potential. Scottie, no (though I admit I’ve never seen him play so take with grain of salt)"
"Cade 100%, I'm not even sure how anyone could argue otherwise...the number you listed don't tell the full story...  \- Jalen Green has been pylon on defense, I mean truly terrible... and Cades played pretty solid defense thus far  \-Jalen isn't much of a facilitator/play maker yet and that's probably the biggest thing that separates the two players, Cades playmaking ability is arguably his best/most developed skill right now and he's excellent at getting other involved  \- Cade is a better rebounder which is expected as he has the size and height/length advantage   No knock on Green but he's still extremely raw in a lot of areas, Cade's shooting has been disappointing but he's clearly much further ahead in his development than Jalen at this point"
"Athletically, it has to be Jalen Green. He has the athleticism of a young Kobe… it’s ridiculous and we all know it. But he’s been underwhelming this season… given he is on an inexperienced rockets squad, i at least expected his G league experience to translate more. Overall I think Scottie, doing the things he’s doing to grown men at 20, has the most potential for greatness during his career."
If you offer me BOTH Cade and Jalen Green for Scott Barn I’d say no
"If Barnes' offense keeps developing like it looks like it might...he's got the highest ceiling. But if it doesn't, and he winds up as a phenomenal 2-way guy that's a 2nd or 3rd option? That is still a damn good outcome. I don't know what the average outcome is for Jalen Green. I think it's below Barnes'. That doesn't mean Scottie is guaranteed to have a better career, but I think on average, Green winds up worse. I could be wrong.   Cade's passing is going to make him have the highest offensive ceiling. IDK if he can ever be the defender Scottie is."
"Cade has the highest floor, Green has the highest offensive ceiling, Barnes has the highest overall ceiling.   I think Green is the most likely to reach his ceiling, but Barnes has the potential to be a premier two way player if he can get a legit shot. Cades obviously gonna be really good, but I think Jalen has some really nice scoring potential"
Jalen Green is doing a far bit less than I thought.  Was expecting him to average like 18/4/4 on average defense.
Bro he’s just trying to say the hairstyles nowadays are wild. For example ja morant and jalen green have pretty crazy hair and stop trying to make everything sound racist lol it ain’t that deep.
Morey says throw in Jalen Green and 5 first round draft picks then maybe he’ll think about it
"Wall would definitely get HOU more wins if he was playing.  They won 30% of their games when he played last year and they have a similar team this year ... basically just added Jalen Green, Sengun, and Theis.  A 30% win rate this season would have them around 5th worst in the league.  So yeah it could be an impactful difference.  With that said, I say play him.  Sick of watching how bad this team is."
"""I am going to average 20, you can directly quote this""  -Jalen Green"
Mobley playing defense like a 5 year veteran was not something I expected.  And Jalen green hasn’t really wowed me after al that talking he was doing.  Chris Duarte is the most surprising for me though
Jalen green has been disappointing.
Having a memory != keeping track of shit   Or I guess it is subconsciously keeping track? Although odd to consider that obsessive  But this is coming from the dude who is so insecure about Jalen Green that he’s active on r/rockets despite being a Pistons fan so.. speaking of obsessive..
Both have stunk but Cade has been better just because Jalen Green has been next level atrocious
"I said it’s not even close in reference in comparison to Cade vs Jalen green. Didn’t say Cade was in the running for roy. I agree, Mobley and Scottie are the two front runners and they’re the only ones that are really in the running rn"
I think with time they're both going to be really good players I think Cade is the better all around player and he's significantly bigger  and is a better defender and ball distributor which gives him more versatility and will probably see time at three different positions.  Jalen Green will IMO be a better pure scorer but I don't think he's going to be a guy who will play any other role other than shooting guard which isn't a knock I think they both have very bright futures but they are very different players so I'm not sure if we should compare them by their individual skill sets.
Jalen Green has a -31.3 on/off net which is one of the worst that I have ever seen.
"That shouldn’t be too tough between Wood’s bubble drama, Jalen Green being a top draft pick, and the fact that most of this sub’s users are Sengun’s alts"
[Jalen Green Is Efficient! Quit The Slander! ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/r2yz4h/why_do_people_say_jalen_green_been_inefficient/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
"Rockets fans hate everyone except Sengun, jalen green and Kenyon Martin"
Kuminga and Jalen Green are the two most explosive athletes in the class
"Green is a freak athlete but I don't necessarily see ""great defender"" in his future. Not everyone is able to just bulk up and become physically imposing, and Green is skinny as all hell right now. The G-League Ignite team used to run a practice play called ""baby"" where they'd get a bigger player iso'd on Green and just back him down all the way to the basket. Apparently Jalen hated it.   I think he can certainly become passable with enough effort, training, and seasoning, but he's gonna get picked on defensively for a while."
I wonder if they’ll put him in now that Jalen Green may miss time. I suspect they were trying to balance the young kids.
Jalen Green is the most unstoppable when he gets hot. Definitely not biased tho
As if Jalen Green was gonna stop him from doing that anyway.
some people like seeing ja fly in the air. its really that simple. im one of them. same thing with jalen green.
"1. He was overhyped, dude is a good young player but the 50 point performance made people think he is currently more than what he is.  2. He’s being asked to be a full time point guard on a team with very little talent. KPJ is better as a secondary ball handler, and the Rockets do not have a true point guard on the roster.  The dude is still a part of their young core, but him and Jalen Green play the same role, and it makes sense that the Rockets are hotter on Green."
"Kemba's teams always played well with him on the floor to a degree where if you squinted and imagined Charlotte with actual depth you can see how they could have made the playoffs a bunch more times, but they collapsed every time him and Zeller were off the floor.  Then this year the only high minute player with a worse on/off is Jalen Green cause the Rockets are terrible and he plays 30 mins a game with all sorts of other teenagers."
"Cade’s gonna be a nightly triple double threat (he already is). Once his shot is consistent it’s pretty easy to see multiple all stars &amp; all-NBA’s for the vegan man, just a well rounded player that’s good at everything even defence.   Mobley’s length, skill, defensive IQ, passing ability/court vision &amp; soft touch is every team’s wet dream in a big man. He’s also almost a lock for all stars &amp; all-NBAs, and will definitely contend for DPOYs.   Scottie Barnes has a ton of upside due to his monstrous frame - not to mention his skill. He’s a little too unselfish to a fault for me to consider him a future bonafide superstar, but his upside is certainly there, as a do-it-all forward that connects the offence and the defence by himself. He could play the Draymond role quite easily.    Jalen Green might not have as much upside cause of how one-dimensional he is - a pure scorer - but man can you see stardom when his shit works out right.   Then shoutout to Kuminga who got crazy potential - I see a world in which my man becomes a Jaylen Brown type, a true 2-way star - and also big shoutout to Franz Wagner, a less athletic Scottie Barnes but better on both ends.   Not to mention Sengun, such a talented big man workin down in that low block or operating in the short roll, his potential is sky high. It might be limited due to his height (only 6’9) but his passing skill is crazy, handling is nice, and IQ well beyond his years. Gotta work on his fouling tho, which will differentiate him from a starter to a backup."
Jalen Green in shambles
why would you be confused? He's clearly talking about last year and this year.  &amp;#x200B;  Didn't Houston have a ridiculous losing streak last year?  &amp;#x200B;  I tuned in to a Houston game the other week... figured it was time to check out Sengun and Jalen Green.  &amp;#x200B;  I couldn't keep watching. It was truly a turd of a game.
I think Jalen green has been the worst player so far. Not gonna be a popular answer but I legitimately think his poor efficiency and horrible defense makes him the worst. Obviously his talent is not the worst but his IQ and defense makes him definitely worse than a guy like harkless IMO.
"This is going to sound like a real homer pick and idk if he counts since hes technically 24.3 but I've seen enough to believe OG could be a future all star. He should definitely be in the mix if eligible. But agree with most of the obvious picks.   I'd order them as follows from most to least likely to nab future all star selections. I'm taking current situation into account so team success and team role play a factor. Also, * indicates that an all star selection was  already achieved so I'm choosing to rank these guys at the top of the list regardless of whether a non-all star shows more potential:   1. Luka Doncic*  2. Jayson Tatum*  3. Trae Young*  4. Zion Williamson*  5. Bam Adebayo*  6. Ja Morant  7. LaMelo Ball  8. Anthony Edwards  9. Cade Cunningham  10. Evan Mobley  11. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  12. OG Anunoby  13. Jaren Jackson Jr  14. De'Aaron Fox   Honourable mentions (not ranked in order): Deandre Ayton, Michael Porter Jr., Tyler Herro, Scottie Barnes, Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen, Miles Bridges, John Collins, Gary Trent Jr., Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, Devin Vassell, Tyrese Maxey, James Wiseman, RJ Barrett, Tyrese Haliburton  It'll be fun to look back on this thread in 5 years"
I’d take Jalen Green over Avery Bradley
Its Jalen Green and its not close.
"I never got the Jalen Green hype. He was the prospect I wanted the Warriors to somehow package 4 and 14 for, but they overreacted so hard, especially with the Green &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cade thing."
"Jalen Green being overhyped, I guess. After summer league consensus here was that he was gonna sleepwalk to ROY or something. Ridiculous. Maybe 'overhyped' is the wrong word to use here because he clearly still has amazing potential but I thought there was gonna be several rookies with better starts and imo more upside than him, and so far that has seemed to be the case"
"Bad results doesnt mean lack of effort.  I feel like lack of effort is used as an excuse for just missing your shots ""he wanted it more"" is a sham of a saying imo.  I am a warriors fan but ive watched many teams this season (because i am a basketball junkie) and you cant tell me the Rockets/Timberwolves/Pistons/Spurs etc dont play hard top class basketball.  I love seeing the elite ball movement on the young spurs, the push and pull of jalen green and christian wood play styles, the assortment of talented players on the Pistons, and the all stars on Twolves trying to redeem themselves."
Lol nah it was just a friendly guess. I fell for the Jalen green hype vids I thought he'd be immediately impactful
"Hey no shame in losing to Jalen Green, future 4-peat MVP"
Why did Jalen Green only played 10 mins? Is he injured?
"Prayers up to Jalen Green. My boy DHouse bounced back, my son Sengun is growing up before our eyes, KPJ returned and played well enough, Matthews/Brooks were amazing, and Silas coached his ass off w/rotations, timeouts, and not playing double big/three non-shooters lineups.  Amazing all around"
Yay pray for Jalen Green guys!
"Everything y’all Rockets fans are complaining about are things I and every other fan of a shitty team has complained about. Everything y’all are saying in defense of your young players are things we’ve said about our young players. You know something else we have in common? We are always wrong.   You know what ends up making a team good? It isn’t playing all your young guys. It’s replacing them with good players. Jalen Green might become a star, Sengun has a shot too. Everyone else maybe has a shit to be the 7th man on a mediocre team, likely a team that isn’t yours in 4 years.   These are the facts of being a rebuilding team. I don’t need to watch every minute of Rockets basketball to know that."
"If he should play the better players then kpj shouldnt be playing pg and shouldnt be starting, jalen green should be the sixthman and wood should be a back up center but hey who can they start? Sengun and kmj are the only ones capable of starting and even they are too inexperienced."
Jalen Green skinny and he bout to take over the league in a few months  Ja is skinny too
"...smh you're getting ""wing"" and ""perimeter player confused"", now i see. Wall and KPJ are perimeter players, and so is Jalen Green, but for the last time, Wall is NOT A WING"
"nope. if they draft a wing, like for example Jalen Green, Rockets could run a lineup like: John Wall at point guard, KPJ at shooting guard, Jalen Green at small forward. Green would be starting alongside Wall and KPJ, not coming off the bench behind them"
"Idk if this is actually unpopular but I think the NBA and WNBA should forbid all pro players from playing for the national team. The USA will win the Olympics this year and it won’t be close. Instead of having our best players dominate the tournament, it should be non-pro/minor league players (College, G-League, Overseas Americans, Semi-pro, etc.). The tournament would be way more competitive and it would make our gold medals more worth it. It would be interesting to see Cade Cunningham, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green and co represent The USA Men’s team in the Olympics. We’d also likely get to see some Americans playing in China or Europe, which would give them great recognition. The way it currently is makes for a stale product. Who really wants to see team USA effortlessly wallop every single opponent? I’d much rather watch games that are actually gonna be close.   Just an FYI, The United States Men’s team currently has a record of 138-5 in the Olympics. The Women’s team has a record of 66-3 in the Olympics."
Either him or Jalen Green. I’m not saying either won’t be good/great players in the NBA I just don’t see him being a generational player in the league like a Luka/LeBron/Zion. (A lot of people have been comparing him to Luka and they are too different type of players imo).
I think if any one of the players in this draft has a shot at being amazingly good it’s the Jalens. Jalen Green looks like he could by a bigger Kyrie and Jalen Suggs has a ceiling of being a good Paul George-type
"Just answering the question, no, it is not fair to say Jalen Green has a higher ceiling than Cade. The difference in athleticism is made up for in the unteachable vision and instincts as a facilitator Cade has shown. At best I'd say they're about even, but I give the slight edge to Cade."
Jalen green is going to be rookie of the year.
"&gt;Why does everyone think Cleveland wants Mobley badly? What happens to Allen then??  I'm under the impression that Cleveland wants Jalen Green badly lol. I'd assume if they do it'll result in the following: they draft Mobley, they'll give the Mobley/Allen experiment a try, or they'll possibly trade down with another team/ S&amp;T Allen, but tough to find another suitable team that won't be hardcapped."
"Yea so this post is insane. Dead giveaway that Jalen Rose is spot on.  Bc there is no way on God’s green earth 75 other people agree that Kevin love actually IS worthy of a spot based on merit. 5 tool player? Guard the perimeter? Lolol TF are you even talking about?!  B-ball IQ? Based on WHAT? What EXACTLY about Kevin love indicates he has a high b-ball iq??Lemme guess he’s scrappy and outsmarts guys instead of physical ability too huh   See this is why we know there’s smoke here. I’ve seen reasonable takes from presumably white posters that say love is a bad selection but it’s likely veteran preference. Ok cool. I could maybe see that. But to see a bullshit post like this upvoted shows that at least SOME white people are consciously or subconsciously on some bullshit, and would rather call Jalen rose a”dufus ” than to get dirty and discuss race"
Jalen Green G-League stats  Jalen Green: 15 games 17.9 pts (6.3/13.6) .461 FG (2.1/5.7) .365 3PT (1.9/2.3) .829 FT% 4rebs and 2.8 ast .613 TS% .537 eFG%   Playoffs: 1 game 30 pts (11/20) .550 FG (3/10) .300 3PT (4/7) .571 FT 5 rebs 7.0 assist
KPJ and Jalen Green  !remind me in 20 years
Jalen Green is jumping from 18 ppg in the G League immediately to 25 ppg in the NBA??
"This is often the case for someone as athletic as Jalen Green. He’s more gifted physically at his position so it’s very enticing to imagine him improving his basketball skills to go along with that size and athletic ability.  However, what I like about Cade is the maturity of his game. He gets other guys involved. He contributes in other areas when he’s not scoring. The most special aspect of his game is that he doesn’t rely on athletic ability even at a young age. He uses pull ups, step backs, and he even has legit post moves for getting buckets. He doesn’t over dribble. Just simple moves to get open. His game may age like wine since most of it is not heavily dependent on athleticism and speed."
"Jalen Green is the next Kobe, you heard it here first"
A two-way score-first guard isn’t more valuable than a two-way point forward. Being able to create for yourself and others is incredibly valuable. Jalen Green doesn’t project to be facilitator and has struggled with decision making as a lead ball handler. He’s also not a good ball handler in general at this point and has struggled in half court offenses.
Future Rockets legend Jalen Green.
Yea I think Cade is clearly a better passer than what the stats say. Scouts know he’s a good enough passer to run your offense. It’s why he’s basically the runway number one pick rn. Just in college since his team wasn’t that good he played the role of the scorer more for his team. In HS his teams were really talented so he played the role of the facilitator more. He can do both at a high level when needed which is why scouts rate him so highly. I love Jalen as a prospect but he’s only a high level scorer. Cade is number 1 but if I’m the Rockets I’m not losing any sleep being left with Jalen Green.
Yea but he could be a good second option to Jalen Suggs/Green or OG/Trent if they step up. They’re both only 22.
"Not really, Jalen Green was real efficient in the G League. Long, super scorers that can create their own shot efficiciently have a high floor."
Raptors will move up for Jalen Green
&gt; Jalen Green  I don't think you guys are getting Jalen Green. he seems like a perfect fit for the Cavs and we're obviously not trading our pick this year.
Jalen (s). Green and suggs
"The Cavs have a lot of needs because they took average guards very high up in recent drafts so I think grabbing a future FRP to move back 1 spot would make a ton of sense. They can still get Mobley/Green/Suggs (whoever falls) and this way the Raptors guarantee Mobley or Jalen Green which is great for them, while also getting #7 and Wiseman."
"Wiggins grew up just outside Toronto and he's not exactly one of those 20 PPG players that gets ""disgruntled"" I'd say, he's pretty laid back. I think given how volatile his career has been thus far, and how much shit he's taken, he wouldn't mind playing back home.  I just think if you do rebuild, Wiseman, 7 and a future FRP is really great value. Wiseman has been through a lot of shit so his ceiling is still really high (and I'd trust Raps to develop him over most franchises). And 7/future FRP gives you the assets to make a trade up to 3 if Jalen Green is there. You could package 4, the future FRP and a contract you want to offload to the Cavs for 3 and you'd still have #7 to pick a high-ceiling defensive wing like Barnes/Kuminga (if they fall). Green, OG, Barnes/Kuminga, Wiseman is a great young core I'd say."
"Only issue is that I think trading Wood to GSW for Wiseman and the 14th pick would be a win win, but rockets can't do that if they have Mobley. Idk who the Rockets could take because rn there assets are Wood and Kevin Porter Jr and he doesn't fit great with Jalen Green and I think Suggs or Kuminga at 2 is a mistake but idk."
"If Lowry leaves, trading Siakam and getting Wiseman + Jalen Green + Davion Mitchell on the roster would be a pretty awesome start to a rebuild"
&gt; but for Jalen Green who has top 10 player in the league potential you go all out  Jalen Green is just as likely to top out as an inefficient 15 points a night kind of guy in this league.  Everyone around here is talking like he's some kind of generational talent and a lock for greatness.  Yet he's realistically only the 3rd or 4th best prospect in this draft for a reason.  He's risky.
Jalen Green has every bit as much bust potential as Kuminga.
"For Suggs I don’t think the cost is worth it because he has high just good starter vibes.  Suggs has a great medium outcome of being a solid starting point guard for 10 years without being an all star even if he has a slight chance of being an all star (think Mike Bibbyish), but for Jalen Green who has top 10 player in the league potential you go all out.  I’d offer 5 the future Bulls pick, the future Nuggets pick we have and a top 5 protected Magic pick for next year as well to move up to get Jalen Green at 2 or 3."
I just want Jalen Green man.  He feels like the best guy in the draft and I would throw any and all picks at him.  Barnes and Kuminga scare me but I want to do more research but those jumpers look so ugly.  At least Barnes form is slightly improved (I’m 99 percent certain one of Toronto or Orlando takes Barnes).
"That would be an amazing pick for Cleveland, in fact it would be the perfect pick. Definitely don’t take Jalen Green"
Jalen Green
I dont even know who Jalen Green is...
"I think Jalen Green has a higher ceiling because it's a guard/wing dominant league, but Mobley is the ""safer"" pick. At worst he can be a defensive anchor at the rim who is also capable of switching onto some guards the perimeter. Even as a USC fan, I'm not totally sold on him as being a top offensive option, but defensively he will be elite. Like a Rudy Gobert/Clint Capela"
"Idk the way Jarrett Jack described Jalen Green he seems like he could be an All-NBA type player if he keeps developing, it’s hard to do these when we haven’t seen him play a minute of professional NBA basketball though"
"I agree with this.  There’s too many question marks with Mobley. Apparently he considered quitting the team because his brother didn’t make it. His drive is questionable but Jalen Green had that IT factor that you see in guys like Trae, Booker and Mitchell"
DET - Cade Cunningham   HOU - Evan Mobley   CLE - Jalen Green   TOR - Jalen Suggs   ORL - Jonathan Kuminga   OKC - Scottie Barnes   GSW - Moses Moody   ORL - James Bouknight   SAC - Jalen Johnson   NOP - Franz Wagner   CHA - Kai Jones   SAS - Alperen Sengun   IND - Davion Mitchell   GSW - Josh Giddey
"There is a very good chance that OKC had their eyes on Cade since we started this rebuild. I'm just saying that it's possible that OKC would do whatever it takes to get Cade in OKC.  Even if Cade and SGA end up with the same ceiling, we would be able to build a better team around Cade.   Cade might be MVP one day, but OKC would be able to tank his rookie year and possibly the Emoni draft too in 2023.  If I'm Sam Presti, I want a chance to have Cade and Emoni.  SGA is great, actually too good to tank with.  That is putting OKC in a hard position right now...  The reason why Detroit would do this is because they would be able to get that ""Big ass haul"" they are looking for.  If they want Jalen Green + A big ass haul.  Then, OKC could trade with Houston no problem because they are looking for a star to trade #2 with.  It might actually work out well because we have all of Houston's picks and that star player they are looking for.  Toronto will tear the doors down to get SGA too, not saying that they have anything that Detroit wants, but Houston is rumored to be looking at Jalen Suggs.  There are all kinds of opportunity here."
I will donate to a Cleveland charity if they allow Jalen Green to fall to us
Makes sense for PDX to get the #4 pick in the draft.  TOR is not far from a full rebuild.  Added on a legitimate PG in FVV who can shoot the ball and defend.  Vet presence and either one of Jalen Green/Suggs.
"Perfect:   * Sign Kenny Atkinson or MDA.   * Somehow finagle a first for TRoss or Gary Harris.   * Hit on both the #5 and #8 picks or trade up to get Jalen Green.  * Isaac and Markelle come back earlier than expected and are 100%.  * Mo uses his first actual offseason well and comes back looking like Dwight.  Realistic:   * We sign Becky Hammon or Stotts.  * We hit on one of #5 &amp; #8.  * Isaac comes back in late Nov - early December, and Markelle comes back in January.  * Mo comes back better but still comes off the bench for WCJ  Worst case:   * We hit on neither of the picks,  * Isaac doesn't come back til after All-Star, Markelle misses the season. * Mo comes back the same or worse."
"Check out some Jalen Green highlights too, he legit looks like Kobe at times"

I think Houston goes with Jalen Green and Cleveland probably trades down with OKC or Orlando. Only locks I see are Detroit with Cade and Toronto with Suggs.
"Please draft him with the 3rd pick, Cleveland so that Jalen green can fall to us 😍"
"&gt;The Cavaliers hold the third pick in the draft. While many believe they will choose from a highly regarded pool of four prospects -- Cade Cunningham (likely the top pick), **Evan Mobley (who many believe will go second to Houston)**, Jalen Green and Jalen Suggs -- the Cavs are expanding their search beyond that quartet. Sources say Kuminga is in the No. 3 mix, with the organization believing that particular draft slot isn’t too high for him."
"No one is saying he is, but the crux of the argument is that Sexton is due a new contract after next season. How much are you willing to pay him vs. Jalen Green on a rookie scale contract?   This isn't just his second contract in a vacuum either. Jarrett Allen is up for a new deal this offseason, Sexton next, Garland the year after, Okoro the year after that, and so forth.   None of these guys are finished products, but the salary cap dictates we can't really pay all of them, so tough decisions are going to have to be made."
"I mean I think it’s more than they will likely have the option to add either Jalen Green or Suggs as the BPA at 3, AND that they are going to have to pay Sexton a lot. If they are able to flip Sexton for a competent wing and a pick or two they’d be able to pick BPA at 3 and add a few assets in return from trading Sexton while keeping enough cap to sign JA and maybe others."
Not worth it for the Cavs to keep both him and Garland. Both are undersized with bad defense  Garland has more potential so I would cash in on Sexton and replace him with Jalen Green or even Suggs this draft
"If they draft Jalen Green, then Sexton is gone."
Who would the Cavs draft?  I think they got their eyes on Jalen Green so this wouldn’t really help them
"Cade, Mobley, and Suggs are all pretty high floor sure things.  Green is the only one of the top 4 who is a bit more of a wild card at the next level.  The problem with Simmons is we basically know what his ceiling is because he's been there for a few years now.  Teams at the top of the draft are really looking at ceilings because they want a superstar.    Cade and Mobley are gonna be stars.  Jalen Green could absolutely be a star.  Suggs may not be a star but his floor is really high and I'd take him over Simmons."
"Can you imagine if you told someone in January that the Heat would trade Herro to the Rockets and not get James Harden back?   I don’t see how a move like this gets done unless it’s multiple teams, and either Gordon/Wall are moved as well. Also, I think the Rockets are bullish on KPJ and could potentially add Jalen Green."
"1) Steph  2) Klay  3) Dray  4) Wiggins  5) Wiseman  6) Looney  7) Poole  8) JTA  If we trade up to draft someone like Jalen Green or we draft Moody and he's a fantastic force immediately, he can take Looneys spot."
tbh jalen green and jonathan kuminga are probly the only prospects that actually played the best possible competition
"That’s not true. Jalen Green was number 1 comin out of high school but lost hype going to the G League.  I’m still on team Cade as of now, but wanted to point that out."
Jalen Green.    If Nico doesn’t pull this off I’ll lose faith in the FO .../s
"Suggs, unless Jalen Green falls to us"
r/rockets is debating Jalen Green or Evan Mobley
that is until the Pistons draft…Jalen Green
"Maybe weaver pulls an ainge, trades down for Jalen green ends up with the best player in the draft?  They even have similar first names Jalen - Jayson"
"nah he can’t go number 1 after this, Jalen Green wouldn’t have let this happen, he’s the number 1 pick imo."
Who cares about cap it's not like anyone good is going to Cleveland. They're trying to trade him because he's undersized playing next to Garland and they'll probably draft Jalen Green
Jalen Green and Mobley for the #2 pick lol
I think Jalen Green can be a Kobe type player
I'm already on the Jalen Green train lmao.
i would take jalen green over mobley if i were them
They have the #3 pick and will likely draft Jalen Green if he's available. Sexton and Garland are already a bad match can't add a 3rd guard to that
"Feels like that would be a nice pick up for the cavs. Trade Sexton for Harris, then draft Jalen green and run a lineup of garland green okoro Harris Allen. Jalen Green is going to be better than Sexton in the long run."
Don’t forget to add Jalen Green/Mobley to that list. They don’t keep their pick if they trade for Ben.
Jalen Green and KPJ next year is gonna be awesome
"We already have mediocre spacing. Adding Simmons to that equation, also while giving up the chance to take an elite prospect in Jalen Green, is a massive backwards step."
"How are you a Cavs fan and don't have a high opinion of him is the question? I think majority of Cavs fans keep expecting the second coming of LBJ and that's not happening. People are hyped up on Jalen Green and if he doesn't immediately play well, he'll be the next to go. It's like the early 2010s again when we just kept drafting players and trading them to draft players and trade them. Without ever developing them. Except there's no LBJ coming back to save us this time."
Jalen green kinda reminds me of Boston’s 2 wings.   Idk why but I like him over Mobley.
"For one, I know that Sam Presti is all in on tanking.  So, starting the timeline over with the #1 pick and tanking naturally for the next 2 years sounds better than holding SGA captive in OKC while we tank only to hope that we are able to do something in a 2yr window that we still have him(after the tank)...  If Rap fans want SGA, they gotta figure out a way to help OKC get the #1 pick and I don't think that pick #4 is doing it.  I think that it's more likely that Jalen Green is picked 2 rather than 4."
Any chance Jalen green ends up better than Cade Cunningham?
"Pretty much. Sexton is already pretty good at 22 and he's still incredibly young himself.  Jalen Green has superstar potential and Suggs has good potential as well, but if neither pan out the Cavs are shooting themselves in the foot."
"The only path that I see to get #1 is through Jalen Green.  Troy Weaver said that he needs a #1 scoring option, also that his roster is too empty to rule out any one player.  If Detroit passes on Cade, I don't see them taking Ben..."
Jalen Green gonna be better than all the guards in this game
I wonder if they could convince Detroit to take Sexton+3rd pick for the 1st? 🤔 Because as good as Jalen Green is idk why they would move Sexton whose a proven efficient 20+ ppg scorer for him?
"Well, Cleveland is more likely to trade and there is supposed to be real talk of Troy Weaver being a Jalen Green fan.  Green would have to drop to #3 though.  I could see Houston fucking with us just to do it, so we might have to deal with them.  Both Hou and CLE are looking to trade their pick for a star, SGA would be the best on the market."
I feel like this is also a message to the Rockets that they will gladly pick Jalen Green at 3.
I'm guessing they are taking Jalen Green
seems like a long shot that Cade or Jalen Green get passed on for SGA but yea i think if you were OKC there is logic to the move.  Don’t know that i would trade SGA for Mobley though.
"No, I said that I would only trade SGA for Cade.  It appears that Detroit is considering Jalen Green and Cleveland/Houston is looking for a star for their pick.  If OKC is willing to trade SGA, I'm sure that OKC could get #1 but we can't do that with picks alone.  Starting the timeline fresh with Cade would allow to still tank naturally."
"&gt; We are not a franchise with a track record of tanking.   &gt;   &gt;It’s a fool who tanks to target a specific number one overall pick.   \#1 You must not listen to what Sam Presti says in press conferences or what he writes in the papers...  \#2 Careful calling people foolish and there is more in the 2022 and 2023 draft than just one player.  The 2022 draft is atleast 4 deep with Adrian Griffin Jr(Thunder coach's Son) #5-7.  Not only that, but the next two draft classes are stacked full of forwards and kinda slim on point guards.  These next two drafts could be great for us.  Jaden Hardy is projected #3 next year and is supposed to have a smoother shot than Jalen Green.  Patrick Baldwin Jr is the next MPJ at #4, not even mentioning Paolo or Chet...  2023 is atleast 3 deep and all 3 could be dynasty players.  Presti has warned us of a tank, so be prepared to tank hard.  Have you seen OKC prior to the MAPS project that he keeps referring this rebuild to?"
Somebody mixes up the names and you get Jalen Brunson and Josh Green from the Mavs
There's seems to be a definite top 6 in this draft.  Cade Cunningham - Evan Mobley - Jalen Green - Jalem Suggs - Jonathan Kuminga - Scottie Barnes
Of course that’s why I said I’d take cade only way I’d do this trade is if I thought jalen green was on the same level as a prospect to cade and I don’t.
Jalen Green next GOAT incoming
Jalen Green stock been rising and you didn’t think he was good?  Literally most people on your sub have been clamoring for him
Idk man Cade was far and away the number one pick until we won the lottery. Now we can’t hear the end of how good Jalen Green is lmao
Got Jalen Green and KPJ tho so who cares
cade is a certified solid player. what we need to look at is Jalen green! that boy is a stud! the real #1 pick. cade will turn to be more like ayton in terms of success and production. green is luka! 🤡
Jalen Green seems to have the most upside  But Cade has the highest floor
Think they’d only be interested in trading with the Rockets because the only prospects they are interested in are Jalen Green and Cade
Tbh it doesn’t sound horrible sexton has looked great and if you could get jalen green at three it wouldn’t be bad I would still keep the pick and take cade but it’s definitely not a horrible offer
Would you take Evan Mobley or Jalen green
"Yeah cared about Green until you got the #1 pick  It makes sense why Cade is popular among Detroit fans.  But Jalen Green is much more popular everywhere else. It is what it is tho. Both players are gonna be very good, especially Cade"
Cade has 271K followers on IG  Jalen Green has 1.2M followers  Green is a lot more popular
Ima guess its cause they are preparing to draft the best player available at #3 which is most likely jalen green. Maybe if they were in a guaranteed position to draft mobley or cade they wouldnt go through the trouble of shopping sexton but since its Green both their skillsets kinda redundant and clash. Greens taller which automatically makes him a better fit alongside garland. Theres also the fact that sexton has really good value rn since he just avgd 24ppg.
"Honestly I'd take Jalen Green/Mobley + Porter, Wood, and picks over Cunningham"
"Well, of course.  But if they don't love at least one of them, they really shouldn't even bother engaging in talks this deeply.  Better to just start things off on the right foot with the guy you are 100% sure is going to be the future of your franchise.  Weaver has raved about Green so it certainly seems like he sees Jalen as a superstar (and he's a better fit for their needs)."
"Seen some rumblings about them looking hard at Jalen Green over Cade, which is what the Rockets are ultimately hoping will happen obv"
Cause Jalen Green
"Kelly Oubre, a good starting wing. Ricky Rubio, a decent starting my PG. Ty Jerome, a decent young bench PG, Jalen Lecque a prospect with decent defensive upside and a 2022 first round pick which at the time was a projected lottery pick.   That’s a pretty decent haul. A Deal centered around Maxey and Thybulle isn’t better. Now it might be crippling for you considering a deal would involve putting Green in to match salary and having very little if any SG depth, but to say their value is higher than that Kelly, Ty, Jalen and a projected lottery pick is not true. It’s ridiculous to imply so.   CP3s deal is marginally better, just like how CP3 is marginally better than Lowry. But value is subjective so you’re free to think whatever you want."
I honestly don’t know Jalen Green has so much potential and upside

Nah Jalen Green will become an instant GOAT and we’ll win a 3peat. Calling it now.
From 2020-2029?   1. Luka Doncic  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo   3. Zion Williamson  4. Emoji Bates  5. Jayson Tatum  6. Trae Young  7. Ja Morant  8. Nikola Jokic  9. Karl-Anthony Towns  10. Anthony Davis  11. Joel Embiid  12. Devin Booker  13. Donovan Mitchell  14. Anthony Edwards   15. Mikey Williams  16. Cade Cunningham  17. Victor Wembanyama  18. Jaden Hardy  19. De’Aaron Fox  20. LaMelo Ball  21. Deandre Ayton  22. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  23. Jaylen Brown  24. Bam Adebayo  25. Jalen Green
It’s not the playoff drought.   It’s not showing a glimpse of elite talent accumulation or a plan to get there.  Push 2021 1st and 2022 unprotected and whatever else not Tyrese to get Jalen Green.   Bottom out and let Jalen figure it out. Stinker for Victor.
Also a lot of Jalen/Jaylen’s:  Jalen Green (2021 draft)  Jaylen Brown  Jalen McDaniels  Jalen Johnson (2021 draft)  Jalen Lecque  Jalen Smith  Jalen Suggs (2021 draft)
"Jalen Green, try to trade Gordon/Wall without giving up draft picks (Harder to do for Wall), re-sign Olynyk, sign a defensive 5 to help Wood."
"I'll bite.  Jordan Clarkson, Andray Blatche, Jalen Green, Chip Engelland, pick any 8 players from the 2014 World Cup team."
I know there’s a Jaylen Brown and Jalen Green but we need more. Someday some team can field the Power Ja[y]lens team.
now u get jalen green or mobley
"Jalen green is pretty close to Cade, Cade is ahead but not by much"
im not a college basketball fan but i have jalen green over him
Jalen Green. Come to this in 10 years
It’s about to be Jalen Green. Just wait on it.
Jaylen Brown  Jalen Green  Jalin Blue...
"Who'd win ? Jaylen Brown, Jalen Rose or Jalen Green?"
The amount of Jalen is actually unsettling:  - Jalen Suggs - Jalen Green - Jalen Duren - Jalen Harris - Jalen Lewis - Jalen Adams - Jalen Brunson - Jalen Lecque - Jalen McDaniels - Jalen Smith - Jalen Wilson - Jalen Pickett
Jalen Green will be the best out of this group. No bias
"Sexton has some of the worst tunnel vision I've seen in a while. From the five or so games I've seen of Garland and double digit games I've seen of Sexton, I like Harland more. Both are not meant to be ""the"" guy. Jalen green and Garland would work great"
Don't forget jalen green right behind him.
Why would we take Suggs? Or are you somehow expecting Jalen Green to fall to you guys?
He was on Jalen Greens ig live comments talking bout don't tell them to much. He def wants to play with Green.
Lol my guy is begging for jalen green
Legit question because I’ve never really watched the U19 team play: why do top players like Cade Cunningham and Jalen Green not play? Do top players usually play?
Jalen Green
"People around here make way too much of G League performance. It’s not real basketball - it’s every man out for themselves. NCAA and the NBA are both way more team oriented games.   Regardless - yea Jalen Green can score. But the NBA is chock full of guys who can get you 15-18 points a night if given the minutes. There’s no guarantee he won’t just be another one of those guys, and he has nothing else to fall back on if he is. That’s why he’s a wildcard."
"I would agree back when the MN pick still had the potential to be someone like Jalen Green or Jalen Suggs, but now I feel like that would definitely be worth it for GS"
Kevin Porter Jr. Rockets giving him the green light and if we get Jalen Green; that backcourt could be dangerous.
Put me in on the Jalen Green hype train
Jalen Green is not a wildcard. Dude balled out in the G League and was an efficient scorer/shooter. Worst case scenario he's still a really good scorer.
But Jalen Green is the only of the 4 that has proven his game works against NBA-caliber players and *still* have a clearly high trajectory.
Nope. We have jalen green and a bunch of promising players. You owe jrue holiday like 150 million LOL
&gt;Mobley has a very slim build and won't be bullying people around anymore.  Bullying people is completely irrelevant to Mobley's game lol.  &gt;Jalen Green looks like a superstar wing.  He looks like the last 100 athletic 6'5 wings.
https://imgur.com/gallery/FZgjwzJ  Who says no? As a thunder fan I would mainly want to do this if jalen green was available at 3 which sounds unlikely though.
Defense in college is not the same as the nba. Mobley has a very slim build and won't be bullying people around anymore. Jalen Green looks like a superstar wing. Don't overthink it.
&gt; Everyone else has a big question mark  Neither Mobley nor Suggs really have big question marks.  Mobley in particular has just as high of a ceiling as Cade IMO.  Jalen Green is the only real wildcard in the top 4.
Don't really see how they could move up - KPJ isn't hot enough of an asset for Detroit to trade down.  Just take Jalen Green.
You can't mess with our [emotions](https://i.imgur.com/3weHyJj.gif) right now. The draft is still three weeks away and we have Troy Weaver talking about evaluating trades and how good Jalen Green has been playing. Our fan base is a bundle of nerves.
Jalen Green and I'm definitely not jinxing us into taking Mobley.
Jalen Green time
EASY!  Wall and Jalen Green backcourt  Move KPJ back to the SF spot like he did in Cleveland but he can still be the secondary ball handler  John Wall can still play the mentor role/ tank commander
Jalen Green
Jalen Green
"Booker, Brown, Edwards, Jalen Green  Also KPJ is a PG"
Jalen Green!
"Hey guys, I just decided to start a blog and wrote a piece about why the Pistons could select Jalen Green. I hope I'm not breaking any rules by posting a link to my piece here, it's just a passion project that I've had in mind for a long time. Let me know your thoughts and follow me on twitter for more!! https://court-vision.ca/2021/07/03/with-the-first-pick-in-the-2021-nba-draft-the-detroit-pistons-select-jalen-green/"
KPJ and Jalen Green been chumming it up on IG so I think it’s us.
“Jalen green we promise we will take you if you are there”   — Philadelphia 76ers
Really wish he went to Houston for the Cade/Doncic duels lol. But Detroit deserved it tbh.  Jalen Green might be really good too
But I like Jalen Green too lol
"Don’t pay attention to lazy scouting that likes to lump everyone together. Imo there’s 4 tiers within the top 5 alone, with cade being comfortably in his own.   Just look at the size and think of how the league works now. It revolves around the scoring PG or the elite 6’7+ wing. Cade can be both. Meanwhile, Suggs is neither. (Nope, not in the mold of the modern scoring guard), Mobley is neither, Jalen green is neither. And I like Jalen green but chances are you’re only gonna have but so much impact as a good SG."
"The Rockets are more likely to take Jalen Green. He seems to have a relationship with Kevin Porter Jr., they already have a center too.   If I’m the Cavaliers, I pick the best player remaining between Mobley or Green. Then trade away Sexton"
"Uhh I think most fans think these playoffs suck. Watching the Suns sweep the Murrayless Nuggets was really fun. The Clippers without Kawhi was really fun. Watching Harden limp around was great. Not seeing Kyrie was great. The Celtics without Jalen Brown was awesome. Trae Young and Giannis getting hurt was very fun. *Embiid limping around, Danny Green getting hurt, Lebron on a bum ankle, AD going down, Chris Paul getting Covid- all awesome times."
"&gt;OKC trades #6, #16, #34 (Maybe future 1st instead of #34 if needed) to CLE for #3.  I don't see any way on Earth that this package is enough to get in to the top 3.  The 'franchise' potential of the guys at the top of the draft is worth way more than even multiple mid-first rounders.  A guy like Barnes is super-unlikely to amount to more than a high-end role player, whereas a guy like Jalen Green has superstar potential.  Cleveland isn't going to accept a drop like that for 1 or 2 picks in the second half of the 1st round."
Well we got a lot. If jalen green falls to 3 I would like to try to snag him
"When has he dropped hints he likes other guys? You’re only paying attention to tabloid rumours. Every quote Weaver had about the draft was about Cade and no one else. He’s literally said “Cade is who, not just me, but everyone who has the #1 pick would covet.” He loves Cade and has gone on plenty of talk shows and interviews to rave about him, even comparing him to Grant Hill. He’s not gonna show his cards and flat out say “we’re drafting him.” 99% of the time GMs dont do that.  Don’t get your hopes up for Cade…. But Jalen Green is an amazing consolation prize."
"Yes they are lol, they have virtually zero young talent and one of the worst cap sheets in the league, they aren't going to be close to the playoffs unless Jalen Green is All NBA level within 3 years."
I’d rather have Sexton + Mobley than Jalen Green. We might end up with Green anyway
One trade I've knocked around for a while is Cleveland moving up to get Jalen Green - their pick and Colin Sexton.  If Detroit and Houston are high on Killian Hayes/KPJ respectively it makes sense; they have big playmakers who can compensate for Sexton's issues.
Detroit is also rumored to like Jalen Green. This is just the GM doing his job.   Pistons won’t trade that pick.  Not unless it’s Houston and there is multiple 1st rounders going back.   Which probably won’t happen. So Cade will be a Piston.
"Yeah wtf is this wording? No amount of convincing can make me like this guy, I’m very upset with this hire. I hope he proves me wrong and finds some quality guys to put around jalen green"
Green is also 19 years old…the jump that LaVine made is obviously huge and not a lot of players have one like that but Green was a better prospect than LaVine coming into the draft. Green is so advanced offensively for his age I can see him averaging 20 next year with a green light (prolly around low 40%). He averaged an efficient 17 on grown men in the G League…and he had a slow start. LaVine was coming off the bench for UCLA and went 13 i feel like if Jalen Green went to college he might’ve been the number 1 pick. I do agree they are similar and I do think his ceiling is around LaVine’s. I just also think he has the chance to be the next Kobe.
Jalen Green will be better than Cade and Mobley
"That’s very true. I like Mobley but there’s a very possible scenario where he just never adjusts to the NBA.  Jalen Green is the fun pick. He oozes potential and is a offensive star  But if we hit on Mobley, that’s a potential HOF player"
"His takes are typically pretty unpopular in the moment but in my experience they age well.   For example right now he has Cade as the #4 prospect, and has Franz Wagner over Jalen Green."
"Honestly, don't know why you're getting downvoted... This draft has a lot of swings/forwards in the late 1st-2nd round as you mentioned in Chris Durate, Kispert, Trey Murphy 3, Hyungjung Lee, etc. I could go on, there's a huge bucket list of international that have potential to space the floor. (Petrusev/Sengun.) I mean shit Cade shot 40% while being double or tripled teamed at Oklahoma state, and Jalen Green shot 36.5% at G-League ignite. I get thediamond32's point that the top does lack some shooting. But this is a really nice class with a mix of stars/role players/sky high potential BPA prospects.  Not to mention Mitchell's perimeter defense that everyone on r/NBA seems to enjoy bringing up fail to neglect that Mitchell's fantastic defense at PG is far less impactful than a forward's or big's."
But what if I want free karma posting OMG NO WAYYYYYY in the WE GOT JALEN GREEN UPVOTE PARTY?
it'll be the Cavs because they'll probably whiff on the 3rd pick and draft someone totally random instead of Jalen Green or Evan Mobley.
"KPJ playing his first full season. Last season he was kinda thrown into our roster, he didn’t have any training camp.  I’m also looking forward to Jalen Green and Armoni Brooks"

Jalen Green and Harden FMVP🙏🏿
Cade is an absolute draft bust waiting to happen so the answer is still the pistons. The team ranked 26th in scoring  and they want CADE ?? dumbest logic ever with Jalen green right there
Cavs if the Rockets draft Jalen Green
How valuable are those picks in the grand scheme of things? The nets could be good for a long time. Christian Wood has been passed around for a reason and is only there 1 more year and is about to command a lot of money. The #2 pick will be nice whether it's Jalen Green or Evan Mobley.
Because of his showing in the G League. He had the ball early on more than Jalen Green but he couldn’t capitalize.
"Honestly, Jalen Green"
Yes correct Philly and Boston just bet on the wrong guys but in theory you are correct. As for the Nets I think if they salary dumped Harris and don’t bring back Dimwinie they still win the chip next year and would put them under the tax.   Same for the warriors if they would consolidate Wiseman + 7 + 14 and grab like Jalen Green and Suggs they could win the chip and cut their tax bill a lot.   The gist of what I’m saying is if you have 3 real stars playoff rotation players 4-7 just need to be replacement level. Like I don’t need to pay Joe Harris 18m I can swap him with Shamet and get 50% of the returns for a fraction of cost.

I’m not 100% on it but I’d consider it if we pick Jalen Green with #3.
Jalen Green will be nothing more than another Terrence Ross or JR Smith. Watch this space
"Most of the time these “stories” are leaked by rival GMs.   Like how The Athletic reported Pistons wanted to take Jalen Green #1, new reports came out that those were claims made by rival GMs, not from the Pistons camp. GMs and front offices like to use the media to manipulate the market"
Jalen green hasn’t played a single game my boy.  G league stats don’t translate to the nba
Just let them have this.  Jalen Green is basically PacMan
I think you mean Jalen Green and Embiid
Draft Jalen Green  Sign Allen to something reasonable  Sexton is happy being a 6th man long term  Okoro gets to 35% from 3  Garland/Sexton Green/Sexton Okoro/Prince Love/Nance Allen/Nance  I like that as an 8 man rotation with Wade and Cedi getting whatever minutes are left over
Nah. Stay where you are and take Jalen Green or Suggs. Whoever’s left. I have faith in Masai to fill in the rest
Let Jarret Allen walk to Toronto and let Jalen Green fall to 4
"I think you guys take Jalen Green at 2 because he’s more NBA ready than Suggs. That being said if you guys take Suggs, I wouldn’t be surprised if we went with Jalen Green at 3 instead of Mobley."
I doubt sexton stays on the cavs if they get jalen green but that's a good ceiling for him for another team
That front court + Jalen Green and Kevin Porter is a pretty damn good team
Perhaps the most trash mock I've seen so far.  Suggs @ 2 to HOU   Jalen Green @ 4 to TOR   Giddey @ 7 to GSW
Probably because Houston is picking one of Jalen Green/Evan Mobley. Suggs plays good defense and does a little bit of everything. Personally I think he has the 2nd highest floor behind Cade.
Haven't you heard? Jalen green is the new Jordan 😆
Jalen Green baby
"In a few days Garuba, Jalen Green, JayGup and Sengun are gonna terrorize the summer league"
"y'all just drafted Jalen Green, it's not all cloudy skies for Houston."
"Yo things ain't bad for you guys, you got KPJ and Jalen Green to build around on. Really excited to watch Houston this season"
"Now: Jalen Green, Alperen Sengun and maybe Chet/Paolo next year."
rockets are obviously going to have to send jalen green back for someone as good as theis
Bol bol and a second for Jalen green who says no
Danuel House. Average 3&amp;D guy.  Also this frees up #4 for Jalen Green
As opposed to Jalen Green and Kuminga just fucking around in college ball for a year?  Atleast the Ignite is an NBA affiliate with NBA level coaching
Ya David Thorpe said it was bad and actually detrimental to the development of Jalen Green. I trust him more than your average redditor
"Lol harden’s mother is his agent they’re super close   But yeah unfortunately I don’t expect harden to care much at all, weirdly enough he did congratulate Jalen Green getting drafted by the Rockets"
can't wait to look back at all these in 5 years  1. Tatum  2. Luka  3. Jokic  4. Lamelo  5. Jalen Green
Jalen Green hasn't even played an NBA game yet. Yall need to chill
Jalen Green when he averages 36/6/2 the season prior
1. Luka 2. Jalen Green 3. Giannis 4. Zion 5. Sengun
"**Block A:** Start Harden, Bench Luka, Cut Dame  This is a toss-up and ultimately a win-win situation no matter what.    **Block B:** Start Kyle Anderson, Bench Matisse Thybulle, Cut Robert Covington  I think Anderson is easier to fit into any starting lineup due to his range of skills. Matisse's lack of offense/spacing makes it tough + he's been good off the bench. RoCo is too hot/cold.     **Block C**: Start Cade, Bench Mobley, Cut Jalen Green  Ignoring potential, right now Cade is the most pro-ready. And Mobley's mix of length, athleticism, playmaking, touch, and defense should allow him to adapt quicker than Green."
"A: Start Harden, Bench Luka, Cut Dame  B: Start Kyle Anderson, Bench Thybulle, Cut RoCo  C: Start Cade, Bench Jalen Green, Cut Mobley"
"jalen green, the nets picks, and the houston gm's firstborn son"
I think Christian Wood (and Jalen Green) will make them better than Orlando.
Is it too late to take Jalen Green?
jalen green and the nets picks
"Sixers reportedly asked for christian wood, jalen green and 10 draft picks for tobias harris"
"Poor basketball development program compared to what is needed for the NBA, paired up with not so great genes.  East and South East Asian countries don't really create NBA level talent with their genes. Not unless they're mixed, thats why most of the top talents who has an ancestry from these parts are mostly mixed (eg, Clarkson, Hachimura, Jalen Green, etc), the only exception is Yuta Watanabe but he really isn't performing that well in the NBA."
"&gt;I didnt say he was settling for midranges in the pros, I said he did it a lot in college, and while he didnt do it a lot in the pros, the few did, he wasn't good. I agree with you that's not his game. But my point is he's not a 3 level scorer, he's a guy who is REALLY GOOD at getting to the rim and somewhat OK at spot up 3s, but I dont see him as like the potential next guy who you give the ball to in order to take step back 3s in the NBA like I see for Jalen Green  But if you look at his stats post ASB (considering he was the worst player in the NBA pre ASB and those stats don't paint an accurate picture regarding his skill level) you'd see that he was far more efficient at pull up 3's than catch and shoot ones."
"&gt; He also took like 75% of his shots at the rim or from 3 so I don't know how you think Edwards is settling for midrangers?  42% of his shots were from 3 and 63% were assisted, so in terms of overall shot selection, a lot of the numbers are suppressed by just flat out how many spot up opportunities he got which were good.  &gt;He also took like 75% of his shots at the rim or from 3 so I don't know how you think Edwards is settling for midrangers?   I didnt say he was settling for midranges in the pros, I said he did it a lot in college, and while he didnt do it a lot in the pros, the few did, he wasn't good. I agree with you that's not his game. But my point is he's not a 3 level scorer, he's a guy who is REALLY GOOD at getting to the rim and somewhat OK at spot up 3s, but I dont see him as like the potential next guy who you give the ball to in order to take step back 3s in the NBA like I see for Jalen Green  Again, I'm not shitting on Edwards so dont get defensive over what I saw"
You probably haven't watched much ant.. post asb he was only behind steph and dame in pull up 3 percentage.. and not much behind in volume either.. his stepback is developing as a signature move that he hits like 8 out 10 times.. also he has one of the quickest first steps in the nba and jalen green is not better in that..one of the ants biggest advantage is having elite pg level handling as a heavy sg so i doubt jalen is better in that either.. jalen may be more mature as a player than ant was last year and will probably have more efficient season but he's not better than ant in aspects you listed
"&gt;Edwards was really efficient at the rim, but anything outside of that wasn't that special. He didnt shoot great from 3, and 2 out of every 3 shots from 3 was assisted. He wasn't this advantage creator where defenses are scrambling to cover him as soon as he gets a little open space off the dribble that I think Jalen Green will be.  Edwards had the third most efficient pull up clip in the league. You should really watch him more since most of your analysis of him is outdated. He was also one of the most prolific 4th quarter scorers and consistently took over games (watch our game against NYK and GSW for more tape on that)"
"&gt;I'd be curious for some unbiased comparisons between Ant Edwards and Jalen Green?   Full disclosure: I was pretty low on Ant last year and pretty high on Jalen Green this year and it primarily has to do with feel for the game. I think Jalen Green is a tier higher as a prospect than Anthony Edwards ever was.  Both are 90+ percentile on athletes in the NBA. Anthony Edwards is about 25 pounds heavier than where Jalen Green is coming from which matters when the game gets physical. In terms of posters or /r/nba highlight plays, I'm not sure we're going to get as many of them from Jalen Green as we did Edwards.  However, as prospects, I dont think the mental side of the game is that close. I think right out of the game, Jalen Green is going to be the type to be able take the ball up to halfcourt and be that much more deadlier in ISO or initiating a play. I think his first step is stronger and he will not be forced into settling for as many mid-range jumpers. He has a more advanced handle and is just in general going to be better at creating advantages and opening up lanes in the defense in a 5v5 game. I think his stepback off the dribble when a defender sticks to him is just significantly better. I dont think we're going to see a 49% eFG rookie season from Green.  This really isn't me shitting on Edwards, I just think Green is a really special player. If we didn't know what we knew about Edwards' rookie seasons, there are still a lot of red flags from his college season at Georgia that he still hasn't ironed out that Green simply doesnt have in his game. Just my 2c."
"That’s a joke right? One went to ecf.. one is a bottom feeder that just got a few pieces that has yet to play the game. Unless jalen green turns to Kobe lite, nope."
Hawks have already seen an ECF with their young core playing a huge part. I don't see how it's even an open discussion at this time. Lamelo and Jalen Green doesn't even begin to touch what the Hawks have going on right now.
Who cares we got Jalen green
I have Jalen green. He showed he can score and be pretty dominant in the g-league. We’re yet to see if Cade can compensate like say Luka does to find his shot and make buckets
"I actually don't think it's Cade. So much of his game is based on court awareness and technique. The things he did in college on a regular basis won't work in the NBA. He loves to post up smaller guards, but he ain't gonna find many of them. He takes lots of bad pull up threes and misses lots of them.  Eventually he is gonna be great, but I think it will take a few years.  I think Jalen Green.  But my sleeper is Cam Thomas. The big three from the nets are likely to still miss a lot of games. He is gonna have tons of opportunity to work against third and fourth level defenders and hit open shots."
I'm looking forward to that 2019 u19 USA team who *dominated* everyone in their tournament:  Tyler Halliburton   Jalen Green   Cade Cunningham   Jalen Suggs   Evan Mobley   Scottie Barnes  Those Suggs/Green and Halliburton/Green lineups were lethal.
Jalen Green
"Also, Jalen Green didn't face NBA scheme defense dawg come on did you watch a G league game? It's not even close to NBA level defense let alone college. Just man to man defenses."
"Everything you just said is objectively wrong. Study after study has demonstrated that aside from accuracy/precision the #1 thing an athlete improves at as they become a professional is speed of decision making and action, because they don't need to think anymore. If Jalen Green sees weak side help on the PnR over and over, eventually he will know automatically to throw it to the outside guy. The reason why he is not known as a playmaker is because he played 15 games dude. I promise you he will be a decent playmaker in his career - his improvement over 15 games of seeing NBA scheme defense was insane.   This is true not just in sports but every profession in life. I am a professional and it's the same for me, when you present to me complex information that fits a model I've seen before, I immediately know what to do now before I'm even done seeing all the info. I used to have to take time to think about the same information, only a couple years ago. The hallmark of a professional is experience and efficiency at doing something."
"The quickness in decision making and ability to read the floor is something that is incredibly difficult to teach. Jalen Green definitely improved, but no one considers him a good playmaker. No matter how hard players work, they will never be able to see the court and make split second decisions or elite reads unless they inherently have that skill. It's something that can be improved like you said, to make simple reads and more accurate passes but the creativity/vision that players like Luka, Jokic, and Lebron have is not teachable."
"If we made it to the conference finals, Jalen Green is the next GOAT"
"I disagree with the playmaking point. There is inherent skill to it, like with Jokic. But most NBA playmaking actually comes from reading the PnR defense and half court defense, and how quickly the player recognizes that when x defender moves to help, y teammate must be open in a given spot. This can be taught. For example, Jalen Green sucked at making these reads at the beginning of his G League bubble but he was much better by the end. Lebron is actually the perfect case study of a player who is just really really good at making those reads."
"Moses Moody who was selected 14th will too. So if Jalen Green switches to 4 too, you add 2,3,4, and 5 and you get 14."
"Jalen Green is not quite as dynamite a prospect as I think people assume and is a much riskier prospect than Cade/Suggs/Mobley/Barnes.  First, players his size (under 200 pounds, SG height/length) are seldom superstars unless they are high PnR players.  Tough for traditional SGs (off ball scorers) to become superstars.  So his offensive upside isn't quite as high as guys with primary playmaker potential.  Second, he has kinda bad physical tools for becoming a high level defender - small, skinny, gonna be tough for him to navigate screens or defend big wings.  And physical strength is also hugely important on offense.  And Green low-key has a pretty good defensive motor for a pure scorer, his issues are not effort based on defense imo.  Third, G League stats can be a bit fool's gold, I think people overrate the quality of the league.  I think he is a really good prospect, but it is tough for players of his build and archetype to get that much better than Zach LaVine, even if Green is clearly better than LaVine was at the same age.  And LaVine is clearly not a guy you want as your best offensive player, teams like that have had issues on offense.  Given I don't think he will be a superstar based solely on offensive contributions, I'd take one of the two-way players who have the potential at least to create significant value for their team on both ends of the court.  My other unpopular opinion is that Davion Mitchell's game won't really translate and he'll fall out of fashion in Sacramento."
- Jalen Green is most likely going to be an empty stat guy to start his career  - Evan Mobley is only going to be a solid starter until he puts on weight and refines his offense  - Barnes over Suggs isn’t even remotely a bad choice. People are overreacting off of name recognition and not seeing the issues with Suggs
Why not follow him for being a good bball payer what the fuxk does race have to do with it? Downvoted and aggressively rooting against Jalen green from now on.
Sengun has a better career than Jalen Green
"Totally dude. And Jalen Green is a combination of Bill Russel's defense, Kareem's offense, and Napoleon Bonaparte's mentality, which is ... insane."
I gotta go with Jalen Green dude has that superstar swagger
Pretty sure Jalen green has roty on lock though
Jalen green was like MAX CONTRACT.
Jalen Green was on the same team.  What’s your point.
Jalen Green will be a tier above.
"The way I see it I think both Sengun and Garuba are high potential and they both can be *really* good. Nothing needs to be said for Jalen Green either, that guy has superstar written all over him.  I just think the most vital thing here is time. The Rockets need to let all four of their draft picks this year as well as Porter Jr. and Wood to get a solid 3-5 years to gel and see what they have.  Fans got to be patient here and not call for any players' heads so early - that's how you give other teams championship players. Look what happened to AD and Jrue Holiday for example. New Orleans had both and all they had to do was add another piece or two, not blow it up."
Can’t wait to see Jalen Green lead the Philippines to a 4th place finish at the Asian Games.
The fusion dance between Jalen Green and Jae'Sean Tate
"Rockets made out like fucking bandits in the draft. I’m a fan after this. They made three top 10 picks last night.  They might have just stealth rebuilded under all of our noses. KPJ is a star, if you’ve watched any Jalen Green games you know he’s a star. His bag is deep as fuck and he’s got 40+ inches of vert, handles, shooting off the catch+dribble  and passing.  One of Sengun or Garuba will probably end up sucking, but as the child of a military man, I have a Turkish brother and he was losing his mind about Sengun for months. Watched a ton of him, if Sengun was just a little bit more athletic he’d have had top 3 pick draft stock.  Dude is a center with handles, passing, soft touch, around the rim, good hands, and shoots 80% from the freethrow so you can bet money he will develop a 3pt shot in a few seasons. And he has excellent positioning on defense.  He can make a ton of passes a center shouldn’t be able to make, and yes, he legit has handles. It’s gonna take a while, but when he develops that 3pt shot in like 2-4 seasons he’s gonna start taking people to the rim from 22 feet and people are gonna be shocked as to how he slid.  Please be patient with Sengun rockets he will not disappoint. He’s not a super athlete, but those euro players usually figure it out on D so he will probably get to average. And his offensive bag is tantalizing."
I fucking love Jalen Green.. very excited to watch him
I was actually more thinking that Jalen Green is gonna be more NBA ready because of the G League. I reckon he'll come out the gates a bit stronger than Cade.  I have no doubts that both will end uo franchise players. But Jalens start might swing him ROTY
1st seed lakers sweep 8th seed rockets and jalen green averages 27 this year 😎
He should go to Houston and team up with Jalen Green and make beautiful babies together.
"He’s a younger Draymond Green. He can facilitate like a Point Forward, he can slash, plays great defense, and has great IQ. He’s just limited offensively because he cant shoot well. The Raptors development team will help him greatly, but Jalen Suggs was a better fit for the Raptors"
The Jalen Green pick is dope. Going to be rooting for a fellow country-man (he’s part Filipino due to his mother so I’ll take it like Jordan Clarkson 🤷🏻‍♂️).
"Honestly this was 99% of the reason I was so adamant about getting Cade over Jalen Green. Like of course both of them are talented and both obviously wanted to be the #1 pick, but Cade CLEARLY did his research about Detroit, immersed himself in the hype about the city and the Pistons, and bought Buffs."
He'll  be better than Jalen Green.
Jalen green already look like the sure thing. He has already produced against professionals.
"Nah dude, I dont know what it is about Jalen Green, but he moves like a young MJ. I think you guys might have an all timer on your hands. I was really hoping we would trade down to 2 and pick up assets and take him.  That being said I really like Cade as a prospect and he can do it all. Hes going to be a great player in his own right as well."
Cade is going to Detroit to save the city. Man is on a mission.  He will fail though. Jalen Green will be the better player.
Jalen Green. he is an Michael Jordan &amp; Scottie Pippen hybrid
I reckon Jalen Green gets ROTY this year. But Cade will be the better player when all is said and done
Jalen Green is Kobe-ish in the making
"Jalen Green, won’t be too terribly close either by year 5 **in** ***my*** **opinion**"
"The NBA won, the NCAA lost.   Jalen Green going #2 means that more top prospects will join the G League Ignite. It is just a matter of time until 3 of the top 5 picks come from the Ignite team(s)."
"Jalen Green sadly. I just have a feeling about him, despite the game tape clearly saying Cade.  Maybe it’s just my Detroit sports PTSD tho"
It's better to draft a project with a higher ceiling than to draft a guy like Suggs who will never be good enough to lead a team to the chip .A fully realised Jalen Green would be Kobe esque with his athleticism and scoring ability . Suggs just won't put up enough points on the board .
I honestly think Jalen green and josh Christopher are gonna pan out really well for Houston. I can see Garuba surprising people as well.
Rockets for drafting jalen Green &amp; trading for ASengun
Jalen green?
"Jalen Green will be the best player in this draft  . His physical gifts are transcendental ,the guy will score like crazy . We are seeing a similar but smaller player like Ja Morant score like crazy in the playoffs without Green's jumper or size . He was as good as Cade playing against much stiffer competition ,the Pistons got a great pick but it my end up like taking Anthony over Wade . Anthony was bigger and more complete at that time but Wade was something else with his athleticism."
+ Garuba and J. Christopher who is a friend and former teammate of Jalen Green
I think Warriors or Hornets did.  Jalen Green looks promising too for the Rockets
Lol one of those 4 draft picks you're saying we traded away just turned into Jalen Green dummy
"Watched his draft profile, poor man's Jalen Green?"
"Houston have to be the big winners so far. Next thing is to find moves for Gordon, House and somehow Wall, and then build around:   **PG:** Kevin Porter Jr, Josh Christopher.   **SG:** Jalen Green.  **SF:** Jae'Sean Tate.  **PF:** Christian Wood, KJ Martin.  **C:** Alperen Sengun, Usman Garuba."
Kpj/Jalen green/josh Christopher gonna combine for 55ppg &amp; 3 assists per night and I will love every single second of it
"Jalen Green went from high school to GLeague, as well as Kuminga. So yes, you can. But it think there are only a limited number of spots, as most paid jobs are. Anyone in a GLeague team gets paid, Jalen and Kuminga had $500,000 contracts, though I think some of the other guys were paid slightly less. Average GLeague contract is about $35,000. Is it easier? Who knows really. This is the first year they’ve allowed this, so the results long term are yet to be seen. Short term, those two specifically went in the lottery, Green second, which is very good."
oh shit Jalen Green and Josh Christopher both got drafted by houston they’re really good friends
Josh Christopher and Jalen Green reuniting that’s sick. Were so fun together in AAU
Jalen Green and Josh Christopher 😳
Man i used to watch these guys in hs mixtapes. There were people swearing he was the best player on that class along with Jalen Green etc..
Jalen green and his friend josh Christopher yeee
We got Cade and (Budget)Jalen Green!!
"Jalen ""I went to a sports bar"" Green"
I hope Jalen Green announces he's on the carnivore diet. Imagine the fiery hot takes.
I like this move for Houston.   Sengun is going to be good for Jalen Green.
should've picked Jalen Green tbh. It's the same reaction in our sub when we picked Bagley... I just hope it goes a lot better for the Raptors.
I like this move for Houston.   Sengun is going to be good for Jalen Green.
"Idk if trading two future firsts is great value, but Sengun is so good. Him and Jalen Green should both be super exciting in a high-octane Rockets offense. Ball movement is gonna be fire."
Kevin Porter Jr   Jalen Green   Jae'Sean Tate   Christian Wood   Alperen Sengun  &amp;#x200B;  Damn...
Call it. Rockets 2028 NBA Champions with Jalen Green and Sengun
"The top guys are 20 or almost 20. Jalen Green, Giddey, and Kuminga are the only top dudes not a year or more older than him."
The Classy Cade Cunningham vs The Thuggish Jalen Green
"&gt; Jalen Green proving exactly why… we didn’t pick him?   No y’all picked Cade because he’s the better player, not because he says nice things about Detroit lol"
Looking forward to Jalen Green!
Jalen Green building up that Houston-Detroit money-printer of a rivalry ready.
"I was at the LCA on draft night, people laughed and booed when they showed Jalen Green on the big screen cuz he do look goofy af. The place exploded when Cade was drafted, people were going crazy, he’s literally been crowned the chosen one in Detroit!"
"Detroit was hopping back in 2000, Jalen Green just dated himself  ""a real homie environment"" cringey as fuck  Guess the only fake homie is Green if he is scared to step out of his apartment in Detroit  It's hilarious how ignorant he sounds - now after this he better not step out of his hotel in Detroit, the real homies wont be as forgiving as his instagram followers"
Bro Jalen Green is your best player.
People really coming out in force to come up with reasons for Detroit being a desirable living location  because of what Jalen green said lol.
Man I got no problem with Houston but Jalen Green is lame for that. Detroit vs Everybody
"NBA rookie Jalen Green when NASA does not select him to go to space: ""I wanted to be an astronaut, but I didnt want to go to space. Theres nothing to do there besides float around then go to bed."""
"Well yeah, of course he wanted to live in DET before the draft was completed.  That's a good thing - he prioritized getting selected higher over going to a more preferred location.  If he didn't I'd be concerned.    Speaking realistically, some ppl will like HOU and other won't.  HOU has a lot of cool shit to do, very diverse, excellent art and food scene, but also is hot and humid af and has terrible traffic.  I'm sure the same can be said about DET - there's pros and cons no doubt.  You could tell by Cade's pre-draft comments that he legitimately wanted to be in DET based on the location.  Jalen Green wasn't out here reciting various DET rappers he followed lol he just wanted to go no. 1 overall."
"You don’t understand PR. His PR game has you “learning things about Jalen Green” and he hasn’t played an nba game. That’s how you do PR. You know more about him so does the world. You care about him to some extent where you probably didn’t give af about Jalen Green a month ago. Now fans in Detroit are gonna care a lot more about how his career turns out because of this. He’s more popular and seems to have the play to back it up. He’s in the news, he’s the story, he’s relevant. Whether people wanna see him become a superstar and bring a chip to Houston or people wanna see a cocky shit-talking asshole crash and burn, they want to see him and that’s what PR is about"

You have the right to hate on Jalen green. I always get pissed when media guys shit on Houston. We get the city disrespect😂  Although hoping this is one of those “I don’t like you and you don’t like me” throwback type of rivalries

jalen green
Word. Also I like the Space Museum.   But fuck Jalen Green all my homies hate Jalen Green
Ok now i dont like you Jalen Green. Really an unnecessary thing to say.
"The thing about Jalen Green is he's not going to try and win any sportsmanship awards.     it was funny when during Summer League against the Cavs, the announcer was talking about how Jalen Green ""Really enjoys the game so much, look at that big smile!""   Like nah man, that's not a friendly smile - dude is talking a ton of shit right now and laughing about it. Jalen reminds me of Luka in the sense that he's a pretty arrogant player on that court and off it too really.     Timestamped at 7:55, but through this whole video you can see dude constantly laugh in defenders' faces through his entire AAU experience:   https://youtu.be/XT7TWYxu1vU?t=475"

"Most excited about watching jalen green, think he will be an electrifying player every night. Gonna be so fun"
Jalen Green is trash talking his way into some prime time games and some endorsements.
"Besides obviously Davion, I’m intrigued by a ton of the rooks this year. The top 5 alone are worth following, Jalen Green should be a highlight reel from the get-go and Cade (despite some bad press) to me looks like the next big all-star guard to make an impact in the league. Very intrigued with Mobley’s development, will be interesting to see what he develops between now and the season, and beyond.   And also Davion. Did I mention Davion? I haven’t seen defense in so fucking long I’m thirsty"
Something tells me Jalen Green don't give a damn about nature lol
TIL Jalen Green is a white supremacist
"Doesn’t really seem like a rivalry between him and Cade, Cade doesn’t talk or is responding to any of this. Definitely more so Detroit itself vs Jalen Green"
"Besides my team’s rookies of course, Jalen Green, Kuminga, and Sengun are all people that’ve caught my eye so far through SL"
"I would go:  1) Cade Cunningham  2) Jalen Green  3) Jalen Suggs  4) Evan Mobley  5) Jonathan Kuminga   6) Scottie Barnes  7) Josh Giddey (don’t think it’s fair to drop him since he pretty much hasn’t played)  Also, Scottie Barnes being two spots lower than where he was drafted isn’t meant to be a diss or anything. I still think he’s gonna be a great player and 3-6 are pretty much interchangeable to me, plus that’s where I had him before the draft anyway. I also think Cade or Jalen Green going #1 would be fine"
1. Cade Cunningham 2. Jalen Green 3. Evan Mobley 4. Scottie Barnes 5. Jalen Suggs 6. Josh Giddey 7. Johnathan Kuminga 8. Franz Wagner
"Jalen Green is from Fresno, home boy has done his time in terms of staying in shitty cities"
Umm same for jalen green in Houston lol
I don’t think we care about your fanbase we just don’t like jalen green now
"Based on what I’ve gathered about both of them so far, Jalen Green is more likely to pull that kind of shit than Cade."
"Yeah Cade is definitely more mature. Jalen seems more ambitious and potentially more hardworking though. In the end we'll have to see where their careers take them, but there was def a reason why Cade was the consensus #1 over Jalen Green."
#DETROIT VS EVERYBODY(BUT MAINLY JALEN GREEN)
"You are correct. The difference is close to 4 million dollars over 4 years. Thank you.    &gt;Here's what every first-round pick in the 2021 NBA Draft will make next season   &gt;First pick: Cade Cunningham, $8,375,100.   &gt;Second pick: Jalen Green, $7,493,500.   8.4M x 4 = 33.6 M   7.4M x 4 = 29.6 M   https://kentucky.com/sports/college/kentucky-sports/ex-cats/article253001143.html&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiQq9SLmbbyAhXyGFkFHSrfDskQFnoECAMQBg&amp;usg=AOvVaw1zWpXXvDS7TQ-eZqdDs5RE&amp;ampcf=1"
"Yeah, and here we are right now lol.  I probably would have forgotten who Jalen Green was until the season started but I'm on Reddit talking about him because he just pulled this random thing out of his ass for no reason."
"Cade and green have great potential as rivals, stylistically and personality wise they have interesting contrasts. I remember I saw Cade shove jalen a few times trying to get open off ball during that ps game, and green chirping after a few buckets. I really like seeing that antagonistic relationship on the court. Interesting draft all around. Hopefully (not that they’ll be this good) it’s more of a magic bird than a lebron melo which became lopsided fairly quickly."
Detroit fans already didn’t like Jalen Green and now this  Rockets-Piston games gonna be spicy
Jalen Green proving exactly why… we didn’t pick him? Cade’s embraced the city and Green can’t get over the fact he wasn’t #1 so he’s gotta attack an entire city he spent one afternoon in. dude has the maturity of a 13 year old lmao
"If I learned anything new about Jalen Green these past couple of weeks, it's that he and his team needs to work on his PR Game lol He went from trying to pander to Detroit fans with only a couple days left before the draft to now dissing the city a couple weeks after."
if y’all keep up with football Jalen Green reminds me of when Jamal Adams was like I’d never forget who passed on me in the draft &amp; Marshon Lattimore was like bruh it was just 5 people
https://www.gq.com/story/jalen-green-nba-draft  He literally says in this article that he “wants to live in Detroit”.
Dayum.  Tbh I'm starting to not like Jalen Green.  Seems like a prima-donna
"Really agree Luka and Giannis are the “locks” barring injury. Also agree Zion/Tatum make the most sense as the third guy.  Could definitely see Trae.  I know it’s crazy early and this wouldn’t really happen until the second half of the decade, but I think jalen green could be really special. And this is coming from a Rockets hater."
"Jalen Green projects to be a top player, but currently I'd say Wood and KPJ are your 2 best players."
"This, but Jalen Green"
Jalen Green. He has the bag to become one of the greatest scorers in the game
He is so raw on offense yet has a handle and assisted better than half the gaurds drafted this year.   How is possibly going to be worse than wiseman when you can already see him switching onto jalen green and doing well on some possessions. In what world could wiseman do the same? Wiseman was stuck in mud against bigs let alone quick guards.   Mobley played college wiseman never got too. Its not his fault but i doubt he will better than Sengun/Mobley and maybe even Isiah Jackson this year.
"Even if you remove the heave it's actually right under 56% TS. But even if it was 57%, that's still mediocre. Kuminga has been mediocre all summer league but people talk about him as if he's been playing like Jalen Green or any of the other SL studs so far. Dude in the OP asking why Scottie went over Kuminga when Scottie has been significantly better than Kuminga in SL."
"Developing in college isn’t the same because the college game isn’t the same as the pro game.  There are players who dominate the college game and can’t get tick in the league.  So go to the league, and play at the actual level you’ll need to learn at with the coaches and trainers who develop players at that level and get paid millions to do it.  The NCAA only changed the rule this year because there are so many more enticing options for the top players than to go to college.  Regardless of what they say about “student” athletes, they still want the best players to play at NCAA institutions and if all the top players are gonna go pro right away anyway with the roads paved by Brandon Jennings, Melo Ball, Jalen Green, now they’re ok with players getting paid.  It was never about doing what’s better for the athlete.  I say they should get paid as soon as someone will cut them a check."
"True, but not really on the court. At least not as short as some(specifically Jalen Green) do them."
"I think Kevin Porter Jr. Is gonna be a monster. Idk if people agree or see his personality similar to JR's after their separate incidents with staff in Cleveland.  I believe, even with Jalen Green, KPJ is gonna have a monster season and end up winning most improved"
"tyrese haliburton, luka doncic, dillon brooks, michael porter jr., richaun holmes  bench: demond bane, jalen green, terence mann, og anunoby, robert williams"
"Yeah, the points you brought up are exactly what I felt as well. Kuminga definitely has some issues with his BBIQ but remember he’s over a calendar younger than the other top 5 picks, including Barnes. A lot of those struggles are to be expected. What I see with him though is a budding offensive skillset and excellent strength and body control, he really looks the part of a high level scorer even if the efficiency isn’t there yet the moves he’s making are already very advanced. Also consider, that those older draft picks at 20 years old are all shooting about as inefficiently at 19/20 as Kuminga was in the G league as 17/18.  He’s not a 3 and D guy that you have to slowly build up his skillset, he’s got skills at 18 that OG doesn’t have at 23. He’s more like a 6’8 Derozan or Jalen Brown than OG, and 6’8 Derozan could be a hell of a scorer in his prime. Personally, I’m more comfortable making the bet on offensive upside, because a great offensive player is almost always an All-star, and the best offensive player is always in the MVP conversation. The best defensive player is usually All NBA level, but rarely does he lead his team to a championship as the best player.  Scottie on the other hand has a clear floor as a high impact defensive player, and an extremely untapped ceiling as a playmaking point forward similar to a Green, Simmons, or even a Giannis type of player.  That sounds amazing, and it is, but it’s extremely untapped. He’s completely unproven as a shooter, shaky as a ball handler, not the greatest finisher, not the most creative with his footwork, he doesn’t have the best body control, and his shooting touch isn’t quite there. All he has for sure right now as an offensive player is playmaking and energy, and even if he does become one of the players I described as his ceiling it’s a long, *long* way out. There’s a non-zero chance he never scratches becoming a good offensive player, let along a great one.  TLDR; I think Kuminga has more potential to be a first option scorer than Scottie, and that was the bet I was more comfortable making pre-draft."
Luka-Danny Green-Mikal Bridges-OG Anunoby-Myles Turner  Bench: Thad Young-Jordan Clarkson-Richaun Holmes-Jalen Brunson-Otto Porter
"Jalen Green looks a lot more dynamic and explosive to me. Fultz is definitely very smooth, just didn’t see the suddenness of some of the top tier athletes like Green is. He can of course still get by people though."
Ben Simmons and Jalen Green.
He's too smooth not to. I love that springy aesthetic he has when he moves. Jalen Green has it too.
Jalen Green from Mavs who I think may become an All Star once he has more experience n gametime.
Josh Christopher brought them back for the youngins. Then Jalen Green. Oubre and Jaylen Brown I know was wearing them early.
"I hope more than 15 of them become NBA mainstays just so I could field a team of Jalens on 2k.   A starting five of Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Brown, Jalen Johnson and Jalen McDaniels is easily a playoff contender, albeit a little backcourt-heavy.   Right now tho the bench seems pretty thin with Jalen Brunson as the only sure thing."
"Jalen green has hamstring tightness... so they are holding him out due to precaution because the GM said he has seen enough from him in summer league so he doesn’t want him to get injured... that’s literally  the report that came out... you are hella misinformed, not because he has an actual injury like a torn or sprained hamstring etc...   In the summer league you are still playing against former NBA players like Kenneth Faried, beasley, Mudiay etc, and second year players like immanuel quickley saddiq bey etc, so you are playing against NBA competition and it is NBA rules with 24 seconds on the shot clock and same type of referees, so it is def way more similar then a pointless pro am game with scrubs... as a 3rd string pg with schroder and Marcus smart starting over him he doesn’t have many errors to make and if I were him I’d be trying to play against the best competition possible, summer league is only like a week long then he has the rest of the offseason to do pro am, and there wasn’t a summer league last year either  Also to answer u when U said “so he can let other players below shine” why would he want a point guard below him shine and possibly get the coaches eye and take his spot? U don’t make any sense at all"
"Wtf are u saying? They just held out Jalen green and cade Cunningham from summer league so they wouldn’t get injured, you are a straight clown... Why would he care about the point guard below him on the depth chart? There trying to take his spot also in the NBA also.. how does it make any sense at all that he’s gonna sit out of a game full of NBA competition so he won’t get injured, to go play on the same exact day and drop 92 points against scrubs like high schoolers and college players in a pointless pro am game, he has Dennis schroder and Marcus smart starting over him next season, and he doesn’t wanna get as much NBA reps and NBA game time that he can get? The experience you get in game is totally different from practice and even pointless pro am"
"Best all Jalen roster? Suggs, Green, Brown, Johnson, Smith would be pretty damn good, especially in 5 years."
"There’s a Jaylen Adam’s on the bulls and a Jalen Adams on the raptors. Jalen Crutcher, Jalen Green, Jaylen Hands, Jaylen Hoard, Jalen Johnson, Jalen Lecque, Jaylen Nowell, Jalen Smith, Jaleen smith (not a typo), Jalen Suggs, Jalen Tate. That’s just in the summer league. In the nba, there is also Jaylen Brown, Jalen Brunson."

MVP: Embiid( Trae Young is my dark horse)  DPOY: Embiid  6MOY: D Rose  ROTY: Jalen Green  MIP: Nickiel Alexander-Walker  COTY: Nate McMillan   EOTY: Bulls gm
"Nah. Similar to 6MOY, ROY almost always goes to whoever can crank out the most PPG so it'll almost definitely be Jalen Green or maybe Cade"
"**MVP**: **Kevin Durant**. Best player on the best team, now with chemistry. I think he will eclipse his GSW stats considerably because Brooklyn isn't afraid to play iso. Don't buy the stars cancel out theory. Steph up there as well.  **DPOY: Giannis Antetokounmpo.** I think Gobert (unfairly)  will get docked for being somewhat exposed on the perimeter. I don't think anyone else will genuinely be in the running. I think Jonathan Isaac will be a conversation, but no chance of winning.  **6MOY: Dennis Schroder**, I think Payton Pritchard will start at PG.  **ROTY: Jalen Green**, with Suggs close behind. Cade will get Dwane Casey'd for at least first half of the season.  **MIP: Jonathan Isaac**. Maybe a homer pick, but could be Orlando's leading scorer. He has a lot of offensive game he hasn't really unleashed because he plays like a pastor, and was starting to turn around his mentality before the injury.  **COTY: Billy Donovan**, I think the Bulls are being underrated because none of the names are splashy individually, but when you break it down each player is going into the best fit of his career offensively. Billy Donovan has historically gotten good team defences out of bad individual defenders. IMO they will be a top 3 seed in the East, behind the Bucks and Nets.  **Exec of the Year: Arturas Karnisovas** - see above.  **Champions: Nets (KD)** - Talent."
"Here's mine:  MVP: Curry  Nets and Lakers are top teams, but since they're Superteams they won't get much MVP considerations because LeBron is gonna do a LOT more coasting and load managing in the regular season. Bucks might take it easy this season and not worry about going for the 1st seed. Nobody likes the sixers anymore, and Curry is primed for another MVP Caliber season with Klay working his way back and other roster improvements, they can finish a top 3 seed and seen as a top team below the Superteams.   2nd choice: Jokic, simply because if he carries the Nuggets without Jamal Murray to a high seed, I can very well see him repeating.   DPOY: Giannis   The media rides high on Giannis all time great finals performance on both ends and rank him as the best defender in the league  2nd choice: Anthony Davis   If the Lakers flex their muscles in the regular season, they'll surely be a top defensive team with AD and Frank Vogel's coaching so he will surely be in the DPOY race   ROY: Cade Cunningham  No explanation needed.   Sleeper Pick: Jalen Suggs, Green is too obvious of a 2nd choice  MIP: The hardest award to predict because the winner is usually unexpected. So I'll go with **Jaren Jackson Jr** where after finally being healthy he'll break out to to prove he's a perfect modern day big. Let's say 22/8 and 2 blocks with elite defense."
"MVP: Curry  I can't see the Mavs having a top 3 seed this season unfortunately. I think Warriors have a good shot at it with Murray/Kawhi expected to miss a significant amount of time. Lakers may take a bit to gel and Lebron should be on full coast imo. We say how brilliant Curry was at the end of last season and he could get it this season. Embiid, Giannis, and Brooklyn are the biggest competitors imo. Luka, Jokic, and Trae have an outside shot.  DPOY: Anthony Davis  I'm not the biggest fan of AD, but his defense in 2020 was amazing. Draymond talked about one guy whose never out of shape that was - and we all think it was Davis. He's one of the most switchable players in the league. And a clear top 5 defender.He had an off year last year that i think will help build a narrative for voters. Draymond is polarizing, Gobert won too much, and Simmons is the go-to hate guy for the media. As much as i believe Dray may deserve it, this award is going to come down to AD vs. Giannis.  6MOY: Derrick Rose  Thibs trusts his guy. D Rose is gonna have his role in the offense, and I dont see Kemba being a huge threat to his minutes. Rose is going to keep his 25 minutes, and he's trusted with the ball in his hands. I dont think Clarkson will have the same season as last as his efficiency started to return to the old clarkson at the end. People aren't huge on impact guys like Ingles for 6MOY so I think Rose will take it.   ROY: Jalen Green  He's going to score more than any other rookie, and from everything we have seen, Green already has a level of efficiency to his game. I think Cade is less of a go get his and neither guy will be on a good team. Green's stats are going to jump out a bit more imo. Playing next to Hayes, Cade won't have a high enough assist total to make up for it.   MIP: Rui Hachimura  You never really know who is going to win MIP before the season. MPJ already had great counting stats and most of the improvement he needs to make is outside the stat sheet (defense, shot selection, smarter basketball). Hachimura will have much more of a scoring role without Westbrook there, and he showed some insane potential in the olympics. His outside shot is developing well, and I see a breakout year for him.  COTY: Erik Spoelstra  Exec: Bulls"
Jalen Green (scoring)  Queta (rebound and defense)   Halibuton (Assist)
Josh giddey will be the 3rd best player in this draft class after Jalen green(1st) and Jon kuminga(2nd) with Cade Cunningham being an honorable mention (4th)
Yeah Jalen Green is in a completely different stratosphere in terms of run/jump athleticism compared to Harden
Harden at no point in his career had more bounce then Jalen Green even though Harden is an underrated dunker
"Jalen Green plays better than Cade Cunningham, and becomes ROY"
Unless Jalen Green develops into a legit Star this looks an awful lot like all of Harden’s old teams. Except Harden will probably be on the decline by then.   Wood is solid but who knows if he gets any better or this is it. KPJ is an interesting prospect but I don’t fully see it and either way he’s got a ways to go.
Scottie Barnes will be the 2nd best rookie this year after Jalen Green
"I can’t believe John Wall is gonna ruin the KPJ-Jalen Green experience  But Wall did help KPJ improve his playmaking tho, maybe he helps Jalen too"
Also he is like the exact same type as Jalen green they don't have an actual distributor or someone to run an offense just talented scorers that does not make for good offensive
I think KPJ will win MIP and Jalen Green will win ROTY  Rockets will also have 2 players in the All Rookie team
"Trae, Kuminga honestly might, Jalen Green are who come to mind for ken"
Jalen Green - Bradley Beal/Zach Lavine  Anthony Edwards - Bigger Donovan Mitchell  Cade Cunningham - Khris Middleton/SGA  Ja Morant - John Wall  Jonathon Kuminga - Raw Paul George  Tyrese Haliburton - Malcolm Brogdan
Jalen Green and Andrew Wiggins coming into the league. Hopefully Jalen developes better.
I unironically believe the Pistons will make the Playin and I think Cades gonna own Jalen Green in every matchup they have
Jalen Green ROY. Cade  Cunningham averages 11/3/2 on awful efficiency
Jalen Green as a rookie off the bench
MVP: luka(bit bold but with some west injuries think mavs have a decent chance at top 4)  MIP: porter jr(going get to score a lot next year)  6MOY: rose(lot of good candidates but ride was huge for ny last year and think that’ll continue.  Lot of good candidates so this is tough)  ROY: Jalen green( like op I don’t know much so just defaulting to someone)  DPOY: draymond(think there will be some voter fatigue with gobert even if he deserves it.  Dray is still very good there and gs will be a better team if klay is relatively good and their defense will be their strength like it was last year)
Mvp lebron  Dpoy AD MiP Carmelo Anthony  ROY Jalen Green
MVP: Kevin Durant  DPOY: Rudy Gobert  MIP: Jaren Jackson Jr  6MOTY: Lou Williams  ROTY: Jalen Green
MVP: Trae Young  MIP: Lonzo Ball  6MOY: Carmelo Anthony  ROY: Jalen Green
Curry/mpj/clarkson/jalen green.
MVP: Dame Lillard (I know its bold)  DPOY: Giannis Acantspellhislastname  MIP: Og Anunoby  ROY: Jalen Green  6MOY: Joe Harris
I mostly agree but I think Green will see most of his minutes at SF.  PG: John Wall  SG: Kevin Porter Jr.  SF: Jalen Green  PF: Christian Wood  C: Daniel Theis
"PG - Luka SG - THJ SF - Reggie Bullock PF - DFS C- KP  Bench:  Guards: Jalen Brunson, Trey Burke  Wings: Sterling Brown, Josh Green  Bigs: Maxi Kleber, Dwight Powell, Boban, Moses Brown"
"lonzo, i hated his ugly ass hair and rat face when he was on the lakers but now he doesnt have that haircut anymore so i dont hate him as much.  here are some players i currently hate:  kelly oubre  kyle kuzma  pj tucker   tyler herro  jalen green    here are some i dislike:  devin booker  anthony davis   shai although i dont want to   danny green  james harden   frank jackson   mpj  kristaps   ben simmons"
He was the vet presence on the g league ignite last year. Loves Jalen green.
"Think Jarrett Jack played for the G-League Ignite too, right? Was one of the mentors for Jalen Green"
Jalen Green did it alot in HS
"&gt; As a cherry on top, if the Lillard or Beal sweepstakes ever do happen, a package based around Fox is just as if not more appealing than one based around Simmons.   All you have to do is trade the players you don't want, who don't want to be there, for more valuable players! Trade Ben for Fox, then Fox for Dame/Beal... shit you'll be trading for Luka in no time! Then you can flip Tyrese Maxey for Jalen Green! Why hasn't anyone thought of this before??"
"My vote is Jalen Green, Green is gonna come into the league with a scoring burst coming out the g-league while others have to adjust.  The Early Vote matters a lot in ROTY because a lot of people really dont care too much later down the season, Edwards lost ROTY because of his slow start."
"Jalen Green is top 10 in scoring  Bulls and Miami are play in teams  Pacers are a 4 seed  Giannis wins MVP  Toronto has the best home court advantage in the league when unvaxxed players aren't allowed to cross the border  Lakers and Nets are #1 seeds, but neither wins the chip  Sacramento wins the draft lottery"
Why would Barnes be untouchable. I would trade him for Jalen Green on the spot right now lol
Jalen green underrated
"Oh, yeah, I just meant Jalen Green can beef up. A lot of guys come in to the league a little on the scrawny size and add muscle/weight over their first few years. I wasn’t saying he would be as big as Edwards."
I think he has a better chance than Jalen Green or Mobley
"Jalen Green. No hes not going to be the next MJ, thats a shitty player comp. Some people are out here calling him a MORE athletic MJ too which is just……."
Jalen Green
"For sure that's good input, you think even counting for size, Jalen green is as athletic as Iverson if not more?"
I do enjoy me some Jalen Green
Jalen Green &amp; KPJ about to be playin 82 games of street ball
"Nope. Jalen Green, Sengun and chance at early 1sts &gt;&gt;&gt; Ben &amp; 2 late picks from the Sixers.  Ben wouldn’t have been flipped for as much as the Rockets wanted because they are not in win now mode. Ben does way less for them than the Nets package"
"Tbh taking that trade over the Sixers package was a blessing in disguise.  We don’t end up with KPJ or Jalen Green, if we trade Harden to Sixers  The trade was not ideal at all but it’s far from terrible when you look back"
"Lmao my bad for the length.   The original post I linked, and my reply to you, was about what Jalen Green [said in an interview](https://sports.yahoo.com/jalen-green-fresno-upbringing-motivates-him-to-prove-people-wrong-just-not-in-detroit-173846356.html) 2 weeks ago. He said that Detroit sucked and how he had a chip on his shoulder b/c they passed on him. The problem is before the draft he said he loved Detroit and wanted to be #1. So the Detroit slander on top of his hypocrisy led a lot of Detroit fans to rightfully pile on to him.  In response, Rox fans defended him, and there was Pistons-Rox fans going back and forth. Idk why people are trying to create a Houston-Detroit rivalry based on Cade vs. Jalen, but I guess the drama is fun for them lol. It was a nothingburger imo but I understand why a lot of Detroit people took offense. It was a big deal on the internet for like 3 days, but not really that important overall."
"If the Kings offer Mitchell, then they’d probably have the better offer, but I’m not sure they want to offer Mitchell. They’ve been raving about him all summer.   I think the Cavs backed off of shopping Sexton after the draft as well. When those rumors came out, there was still speculation that either Jalen Green could drop to number 3 or the Cavs could draft Suggs. Now that the Cavs drafted Mobley, I don’t think that they want to trade for Simmons. A lineup including Simmons, Mobley, and Allen would never work.   If the 76ers do want Sexton, then a 3 team trade with the Wolves and Cavs might be the best bet. The Wolves can get Simmons. The Cavs can get Timberwolves picks and maybe Tyrese Maxey. The 76ers could get Sexton, McDaniels, Beasley, and Rubio."
"I rarely watch the Kings play so this is purely speculative, but this conversation sounds like a repeat of the Heat fans going ‘we’ll never trade Herro for Harden! Who knows what Herro will be like in 3 years time!’    I get that we as fans LOVE overrating our rookies, heck I’m doing it right now with Jalen Green and Sengun. But showing flashes of something special isn’t the same as a guaranteed All Star and All Defensive team guy who is still very young."
"&gt; edit: also fuck whoever pinged /u/RedditCareResources lmfao  [A crazy ass Pistons fan](https://np.reddit.com/r/rockets/comments/p6axdi/detroit_tigers_great_day_to_step_outside_and_do/) did it to me(and probably others) when he came into the Rox subreddit after the Detroit Tigers subtweeted Jalen Green lol. I didn't even say anything crazy but bro was super sensitive when people called him out for being weird.   I can't 100% prove it was him, but I got the ""A concerned redditor reached out to us about you."" help message within like 30 minutes of replying to that dude. On top of that I never post personal shit on Reddit or anything that would necessitate a crisis message. I'm only here for the jokes and chill sports/music discussion.  I understand getting reported if you're going into another team's sub and trying to cause ruckus, that makes sense. But you can't be the person trying to start shit in another team's sub, and then be so soft that you report the people you're shit-talking b/c they're downvoting you lmao"
Why would they want a team that could fight for a play-in seed? That sounds like a path straight to mediocrity. Now they have a bare bones bottom-of-the-league roster than can run out Wall's contract and has Jalen Green as a potential future star.  EDIT: I agree Simmons is a floor raiser. Just not sure why Houston would want him.
And here I thought Jalen Green coming to Detroit was gonna be the most hostile crowd this year.
You must have Moody confused with Duarte or someone else. He’s only 19 and got drafted after his freshman year. He’s a few months younger than Jalen Green.
"Thanks my friend! I’m not going to pretend like I’m an expert on many other teams, but I watch 90% of Mavs games, and I think we’ll improve because:  Covid less of a factor  KP was pretty good in the regular season and has a healthy offseason  Luka got Olympic experience (hell so did Josh green!)  Several impact players have improved year over year and I expect them to continue doing so; maxi, DFS, Jalen  Brown and bullock complement this team swimmingly. I’m not saying we’re a title contender but with Kawhi and Jamal Murray injured and the Lakers old, the west seems more open than the warrior years"
Jalen green only
"He was on the ignite team with Jalen Green and Jarrett Jack too lol, they also about the play in the BIG3 title together too  Some guys just love playing"
Jalen Green has hype
Wiggins hype was huge only because we was a pioneer of the “mixtape culture”. To be honest if Wiggins came out today he would probably be less hyped or on par with a guy like Jalen Green.
Prolly a Detroit fan still in their feelings that Jalen Green said he didn't rate Detroit and preferred living in Houston
"first time I've noticed young scottie barnes, jalen suggs and jalen green in the background"
It was [this scouting report](https://www.prospectiveinsight.com/post/scouting-jalen-green) I think but nearly every scouting report written on him will make mention of his quickness.
Jalen green. I am in that hype train.
if I had to build an entire team and I had no other pieces I would only just go for players with development. I'd just take a swing on anyone who could become a super star and figure out the rest and just let them play. There's no reason to draft for fit at this stage just figure out what you have  So I would take  G Cade  G Jalen Green  G/F Josh Giddey  F Jonathan Kuminga  C Evan Mobley   Bench   G - Jalen Suggs  G Bones Hyland  G - Josh Primo  F - Scottie Barnes  F Jalen Johnson  F Ziaire Williams   C Alperen Sengun
Paul George went to Fresno State but wasnt exactly from Fresno. If anything the Lopez twins or Jalen Green?
5 Jalen Green
PG Cade  SG Jalen Green  SF Scottie Barnes  PF Mobley  C Sengun
I live in the California area and jalen green lived in my hometown and pg went to college here but other than that those are the only players from my hometown
Jalen Green
"Jalen Green : ""Why don't they want me man?"""
Damn I can’t believe I have to root against Jalen Green now
Jalen Green also could’ve been the #1 pick if he went to college and built his brand instead of literally disappearing off the radar for an entire calendar year.
Jalen Green probably would've went to college if the NIL rules were in place.
"&gt; College is by FAR the better option than the g-league now.  This is just... not true at all. Jalen Green is definitely way more advanced as a player due to G League than he would have been if he played against college guys, most of which won't even make it to the G League.  I could see Bronny going to college just because LeBron missed out on college and he might want his son to get to experience college life."
"Jalen Green just went #2, made his money, and was STILL talked about more than Suggs, who won a Natty and had major, major moments.     Suggs actually dropped. The G League is a fine option for those who want to be exposed to better talent, higher speeds, and have NBA training."
"I truly believe that Jalen Green is the best player in this class, and has been for 3 years. But it’s great seeing a class so deep that all 3 guys have legit cases for being #1. Hope they all succeed."
Not sure why everyone's saying LaVine. Maybe it's the frame and athleticism? But LaVine does most of his damage as an off ball scorer and running off screens. Jalen Green is more of a slasher than a shooter right now. I think he projects more as a PnR scorer than an off ball shooter
"Lol. I said ""could be"" for Zion and ""potentially"" for LaMelo and Jalen Green. I think that to be the kind of dude I'm talking about -- to have that kind of sway -- you have to at least be in the conversation for best player in the league for meaningful stretches of time. I don't even really think Westbrook or Dame have ever been on that level; it's really just (among active players right now) LeBron, KD, Curry, Kawhi, and maybe now Giannis. I don't think it's some slap in the face to Trae Young or Devin Booker to think that they might not ever be in the conversation for best player in the entire NBA (whereas Luka seems destined to be, and Giannis has just become a part of that conversation)."
"Yeah, who knows if a 24 year old that took his team to the finals will be elite enough to warrant top tier clout. Zion and Lamelo and Jalen Green definitely will though."
"Yeah, who knows if a 22 year old that took his team to the ECF will be elite enough to warrant top tier clout. Zion and Lamelo and Jalen Green definitely will though."
"Jalen Green is the best player in the draft and will be seen as a Luka/Trae level talent.  Eric Gordon is gonna stay healthy this year (please), and whichever contender adds him will get a good edge on the competition. Healthy EG is a positive asset."
5 years ago probably tyreke evans but currently Zion. Jalen green hopefully
"Sure, a star, if the Knicks could get Fox, Ingram, Shai, KAT, Ja, Booker, Mitchell, and probably Cade/Lamelo/Jalen Green for a package around Randle they do it in a heartbeat."
"Williamson by a country mile.  I'd love to see him wind up in Chicago eventually, that would be blockbuster fireworks  Tatum I have trouble seeing reach that tippy-top tier stratosphere, but who knows.  Seems to work hard  However, those aren't the only players worth mentioning here lmfao.  Trae, Booker &amp; Ayton, Ja, and probably a few I'm blanking on belong in the convo too  And we could see some players emerge over the next few yrs such as CC, Pat Williams, Jalen Green, Fox, etc etc.  The League is brimming with young talent"
Jalen green will eventually be on this list
Josh Christopher Kevin Porter Jr Jalen Green
"Kevin Porter Jr, Jalen Green, Josh Christopher"
Eevee is Jalen Green then.
It shows in his game. Jalen Green is next
For me it's    Luka  Zion  Jalen green  For top 3
Friends and I got lower bowl to see dubs vs rockets in January. Klay returns and get to see future of league with jalen green and sengun
Jalen Green
Jalen Green  Christian Wood  Kevin Porter Jr.  Jae'Sean Tate  Alperen Sengun
jalen green
Edwards for sure and Jalen Green
"I would like a team of Danny Green, Jeff Green, Jalen Green, Draymond Green and Javonte Green please."
"Jalen Green, KPJ, Wood, Şengün, Tate"
"I’m kind of the opposite. I think Cade is basically can’t miss. Green will put up points and people will love him, but it wouldn’t shock me at all if in 2027 people on here are making posts like “Jalen Green is an empty stats guy”"
jalen green finna pull it off but i know some nba fans are just waiting for lowry to follow the trend
I think he meant Christian Wood and Jalen Green would literally be his legs
For me it Jalen Green. I can't remember a bad game he's had so far.
Jalen Green is the reincarnation of Michael Jordan
pistons fan coming in peace 🥺  I just want to let u rocket bros 😝 know that jalen green can eat shit mother fucker. Die 🤓
Top 5 players 5 years from now :   Giannis  Luka  Jokic  Jalen Green  shai gorgeous
Ummmmm. I can Trade Jalen Green for Luka straight up?
Totally. The Jalen Green shit on here made me so frustrated lol. So many people going in on how he needs to work on his PR and he isn’t being respectful.   Who fucking cares? These are grown men playing a game for our entertainment. Let them be entertaining!
Jalen green too
Seeing Duarte up there over guys like jalen green and Luka is kinda suprising
"It already has. All these kids getting drafted are wearing those short shorts. Mobley and Jalen green are the ones that come to mind seems like it's on ""trend"" right now"
Jalen Green wears short shorts in games so just watch the Rockets :p
RemindMe! 5 years  My 2025 top 20 list:  1. Luka Doncic  2. Jayson Tatum  3. Trae Young  4. Giannis Antetokounmpo  5. Nikola Jokic  6. Donovan Mitchell  7. Ja Morant  8. De'Aaron Fox  9. LaMelo Ball  10. Cade Cunningham   11. Devin Booker  12. Bam Adebayo  13. Zion Williamson  14. Michael Porter Jr.  15. Jalen Suggs  16. Jalen Green  17. Darius Garland  18. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  19. DeAndre Ayton  20. Brandon Ingram
Jalen green is going to be better than Scottie Barnes
"Giannis and Jokic are 26 and have only gotten better every year. It's going to be Giannis, Jokic, Harden, KD, Curry. Then Luka, Embiid (if healthy), AD (if healthy). The best players 4 years ago are still pretty much the best players now. Jalen Green, Tatum, Trae are not going to leapfrog these players any time soon."
Giannis  Luka  Zion  Jalen Green  Chet
mine in order :   &gt; Giannis &gt;  &gt; Luka &gt;  &gt; Jokic &gt;  &gt; Jalen Green &gt;  &gt; SGA &gt;  &gt; Trae &gt;  &gt; Edwards &gt;  &gt; Ja &gt;  &gt; Murray &gt;  &gt; Zion  &gt;  &gt; Booker &gt;  &gt; OG &gt;  &gt; Isaac  &gt;  &gt; Brown &gt;  &gt; Mitchell &gt;  &gt; Embiid &gt;  &gt; Tatum &gt;  &gt; JJJ &gt;  &gt; Kuminga &gt;  &gt; Collins &gt;  &gt; LaMelo &gt;  &gt; Ingram &gt;  &gt; Cade &gt;  &gt; Bam &gt;  &gt; Wiseman
"Yeah, that looks pretty good, would add SGA though. Cade, Mobley, Jalen Green are likely too. I also imagine players who haven't been drafted yet like Chet, Banchero, Emoni Bates, and Victor Wembanyama could be in there. And can't forget about POKUUUU haha."
"The Cade hype pre-draft was pretty high. And Jalen Green is a crowned superstar after SL. Obviously they could still be stars, but if it goes wrong, nobody on this sub is gonna hold themselves accountable.  /r/nba consistently has bad takes but we get complete freedom to delete our shitty takes and Homer meme it."
Jordan Bron Jokic Malone IDK Kobe D Mitch IDK Jalen Green Shawn Kemp Nurk
jalen green because i’m a biased rockets fan
\[Post-game Thread\] The Houston Rockets complete their stunning playoff journey eliminating the Brooklyn Nets 121-113 in game 6 behind a 35 point triple double from Jalen Green
You left out Jalen Green. He's only wearing zero until Houston dumps House. He seems very insistent on wearing number four.
Jalen green
Also Jalen and Javonte. All J. Green starting five baby let's do it
"Root for the Rockets. I think right now they have the best future. Im high on KPJ, Jalen Green, Usman Garuba and Alperen Sengun"
"Bulls coz they lookin like they built different.   Mavs (Luka is my 2nd favorite player right now and because I think KP is back).   Pistons (Cade).   Rockets (Jalen Green, Alperen Sengun)"
"I don't think Ayton should be that high, there was already a strong contingent of people who thought Luka should go 1st in 2018, and there were concerns about his motor in college.  In 2014 many people thought Embiid was the most talented prospect in the draft, and only slipped due to injuries. If Wiggins and Parker are on this list I feel like he should be around them somewhere.  Cade Cunningham is too high, there are already some people who believe Jalen Green or Evan Mobley have a higher ceiling (look at the GM survey) so he already has a fair amount of doubters entering his rookie year.  It's been a while but I think Kyrie Irving should be a bit higher. He was the consensus #1 pick all year."

Jalen green is already a problem I promise y’all (I’m a fucking Lakers fan)
"Yo, it is   I’m not hating, I love Jalen Green. Unfortunately, the NBA rarely calls this as a travel anymore. In FIBA, this is at least a travel 70% of the time.   The moves are just so quick, it’s understandable that it can be hard to whistle in real time. Green should keep doing this move until they consistently call it a travel."
Jalen Green is more like Ant Edwards than he is Lamelo
Jalen Green really is my favorite nephew.
Jalen green is gonna be a scorer sheesh
Need a Jalen Green masterclass  Sengun taking over tonight
Jalen Green is unrelated to the return of the Harden trade package. stop it.
Jalen green
Lol we still got Jalen Green and KPJ.  You defending Simmons because you believe he’s gonna be on your team
I still think it was a shitty deal for Harden. U guys  really traded Levert for Olidipo and basically got nothing. Then traded Jarrett Allen for a first round pick which is kinda of an ass deal.   U guys were already getting KPJ and u guys didn’t capitalize on Harden besides the picks. The picks are good but still felt like u could of done way better. I like the Rockets tho because of Jalen Green so I want y’all to succeed. You guys have a good young core the best actually.
Jalen Green? You mean drippy Dion Waiters?
Not even MJ tore up the g-league like Jalen Green did 💪
Jalen Green is a young Jordan type volume scorer except with more range.
I still believe Jalen Green is the best player in the draft and has a much higher ceiling than anyone else
Jalen Green is Brandon Jennings with Instagram followers
Evan Mobley needs to demand out of Cleveland   Scottie Barnes is basically LeBron James but high off crack   Giddey is the best Australian player in the League  Bouknight is a future scoring leader   Jalen Green is a Bust   Cade is ducking NBA comp   Brandon Boston is an Elite chucker  Davion Mitchell DPOY potential   Alperen Sengun is white Tim Duncan   Josh Primo is the coldest middle schooler the league has ever seen   Josh Christopher is the best shooter in the NBA   Trey Murphy is basically 6’8 klay Thompson   Franz Wagner is a bust  Justin Champaigne is the next Dennis Rodman   Cam Thomas has goat potential.   Chris Duarte is pretty good for a senior citizen
"PG: Jalen Suggs  SG: Jalen Green  SF: Jaylen Brown  PF: Jalen McDaniels  C: Jalen Smith  For current players, ain't half bad"
"Rockets have kpjr, senguen, and Jalen green as high upside guys.  I have Suggs as lower upside than all 3 of those.  Feelsbadman"
Jalen green
Freakin [Jalen Green said he has a chip on his shoulder](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10010106-jalen-green-says-i-felt-i-was-number-1-draft-pick-after-rockets-beat-pistons) because he was drafted no. 2 like that's a terrible thing.
Trade for Jalen green
Jalen green
Meh. Jalen green better
I mean if I knew back then that the trade was  James Harden for:  3 FRP's  4 pick swaps  Kevin Porter Jr (Came from the Prince in cleveland debacle)  Jalen Green  Josh Christopher  2022 Miami pick swap  &amp;#x200B;  I would've been really really happy actually
"lool scottie with more points than jalen green, more rebounds than mobley, and more assists than suggs"

Jalen green should be the favorite
"Gonna be arguing who the best player in the league is between luka and jalen green soon, watch."
"4-14 for Jalen Green, did the Rockets make a mistake drafting him over Cam Thomas?!? 👀👀👀"
Jalen green about to dookie on your favorite team
&gt;He could easily be better than LeVert if he reaches his potential lol  Thats the thing I dont think KPJ will reach his full potential at all because of his character problems. Jalen green is gonna be the one who turns into a superstar not KPJ  Cleveland would obviously like to have KPJ back but like I said I dont think they are gonna lose sleep over that move
KPJ and Jalen Green = neo CP3 Harden
Jalen Green Fans punching the air
Jalen green had the Kobe hype in the draft 😱
Jalen green should be #1
"For this class, I'm feeling Jalen Green or Scottie Barnes"
It’s gonna be Jalen Green. He’s the best player in the draft
JALEN GREEN SZN 🍀
"3 young players of today I would like to play Jesus’s son: Jalen Green, Lamelo Ball or Ja Morant. Jesus was a guard and so should an on camera son. It should be a young face that’s “up next”."
He once tried to argue to me that Caruso is a better scorer than Jalen Green because he had a higher points per 36 minutes in the G League.
"Cade to me has already shown he's not worth a lottery pick. I would pick him in the mid teens early 20s. Jalen Green would go 1st, Barnes would probably go 3rd at this point"
Anthony edwards= mj propaganda  Jalen Green= kobe/mj hybrid propaganda
"Scottie  Only Rookies I would trade Scottie for is Jalen Green and Evan Mobley, there is nothing special about Cade"
"Looking back, they did well in the Harden trade. It allowed them to tank to get Jalen Green, and they got lucky with Kevin Porter Jr, and as they got expiring's it allowed them to be younger. They will be a very fun team"
"Came for Khyri Thomas, staying for Sengun, Jalen Green, Christian Wood, Garuba and KPJ."
"I'm a big KPJ believer too, I can realistically see him around like 18/4/7. Really excited to see him and Jalen Green this season."
1. Zion  2. Anthony Edwards  3. Cade Cunningham  4. Ja Morant  5. Jalen Green  6. LaMelo Ball
1. Zion   2. Cade Cunningham   3. Jalen Green (A lot of teams would of taken him #1 instead of Cade)   4. Ja Morant  ( Wasn't a great prospect was clearly ahead of Barrett though. It was a perceived weak draft class at the time which might have been correct.)   5. Anthony Edwards (At the time he wasn't unanimous)   6. Lamelo Ball (Dropped because of Lamar and Lonzo Ball nothing would of changed)
"1. Zion  2. Cade   Those are clearly top 2  3. Jalen green   4. Ja morant  This one is a little bit more stuff, they can go back and forth  5. Ant  6. Ball  At the time both these guy were pretty risky prospects"
"&gt;ere might be another Draymond Green or Paul Millsap who's about to make his breakout that was drafted in like 2019 that just isn't on our radar right now  That 2019 second round coincidentally has a lot of guys who could pop off this season:   Nicolas Claxton, KZ Okpala, Daniel Gafford, Eric Paschall, Isaiah Roby, Talen Horton-Tucker, Terance Mann, Jalen McDaniels.  Then there's the ultimate wildcard in Bol Bol."
Literally acknowledged it was unlikely in the original comment lmao but there’s nothing wrong with him setting that goal lol he’s extremely skilled and going into his third year and he understands the offense is gonna be focused around Jalen green scoring and him being primary ball handler .. idk why you got so mad about that lmfao
"&gt; And yeah, of course you can pair Ben Simmons with no stars, with the ideal 5 like Christian Wood or Chris Boucher, don't pair him with any ball dominant guys or paint cloggers, give him a team of shooters, and that may get you a 25/10/10 Simmons but also a team perpetually a few games out of the playoffs. Simmons is probably a low-ceiling/high floor player that reminds me of Westbrook.  There are enough possessions in a game that it's possible for ben to have a lot of time onball, while still ultimately deferring to an elite offensive option. I think christian wood, ben simmons and a fully realized jalen green could be a great trio.  &gt; I'm really confident it'll have nothing to do with the fit of his team, if it happens it's going to happen from within himself.  I mean I think the fit matters a lot, but at the same time yes there needs to be personal growth, I agree."
"He’s still going to be near 8 assists a game with a healthy roster, a full off season and training camp and jalen green on his side who is a sniper. 18/8 on 56% TS with like 3 turnovers a game is my realistic expectation for him"
Jalen Green  Kenyon Martin Jr  Eric Gordon
Jalen Green is going to demand a trade to a California team in year 3.
"well, *personally* i was NEVER sold on Ben Simmons the way everyone else was. i didn't think he'd end up like this, but it didn't rub me the right way when Brett Brown was at a press conference begging Simmons to at least try to shoot the ball, and he still didn't.  obviously hindsight is 20/20, but from that day on i've been more critical of him, so when his name kept coming up, i wasn't exactly excited. between Jalen Green, Josh Christopher, and Alpern, i'm already happy with the haul we got.  although, im not sure if that's something that happened because of, or in spite of Fertitta."
Jalen Green 1st  Everyone else 2nd
gsw is not making playoffs  not bold cause i think he will win it 100% Jalen Green roy.
Cades a bust.  Jalen Green is the jewel of this draft
"KPJ, Jalen Green, Wood, Theis, and Eric Gordon gonna eat"
I’ll be happy if he’s an all star  Jalen Green is our guy
NBA teams are going to take Jalen Green to the rim everytime he’s very skinny
I had a middle school class with Jalen Green btw guys
"- ATL: Hunter will win MIP. - BKN: Nash will find a way not to play Claxton again. - BOS: Nesmith will turn out to be a player in the mold of Covington much sooner than expected. - CHA: Plumlee will have a double double season with 4 APG. - CHI: Patrick Williams will struggle in his soph year. However, those counting him out long term will be wrong, as he'll develop in a major force after this season. - DAL: Tyler Terry will break out and play a decent role. - DEN: Zeke Nnaji will start pushing Gordon by shooting lights out. - DET: Jerami Grant will be traded before the AS game. - GSW: Poole will have at least 5 games in which he shoots 20 FG and hit under 6 of those. - HOU: Jalen Green will win ROY. - IND: Chris Duarte runner up for ROY. He'll post averages somewhere in the line of rookie Mitchell/Wade. - LAC: Will be very very disappointing. - LAK: Wayne Ellington is top 5 in 3pm this season. - MEM: Melton will, once again, play very limited minutes. - MIA: Haslem will play only a handfull of minutes but will be ejected from one game for a fight. - MIL: Grayson Allen will fill in nicely for DDV and might not give up tge starting position when DDV returns. - MIN: KAT will have a season which has him in the convo for MVP but ultimately not win due to team record. - PHI: Jaden Springer will surprise. He will become what people hoped Zhaire Smith would be, before he nearly died. - PHO: Mikal Bridges does not take that next step. - POR: Nassir Little top 5 MIP. Larry Nance 6MOY. - SAC: Haliburton and Davion Mitchell will make at least 5 starting backcourts cry this season. - SAS: Devin Vassell still will be disappointing.  - TOR: Khem Birch will average a double double. - UTA: Bojan will be traded before the AS game. - WAS: Gafford will post a pts/blk/reb triple double."
G League might be good if you’re a Jalen Green or Jonathan Kuminga but ultimately it proved to be not beneficial for prospects like Isaiah Todd or Brandon Boston  I think as time develops there’s gonna be more prospects going to different places to showcase themselves more individually
"Says a lot about Sam Presti's GMing when Houston can already have better players than OKC rebuilding in less time. Assuming Jalen Green is going to be as good as SGA.   OKC could've had Sengun btw, if Sengun turns out to be really good it begs the question what is OKC doing if they have no endgame with their picks."
"I'm interested in you guys, I wanna see your fans reception to Jalen Green when it's Houston @ Detroit ✊🏻"
Yes. Jalen Green
"To be fair to Hammond he only had 1 top 6 pick and he failed because of injuries. Even if all of Hinkie’s picks worked he set himself up for failure as they’d now have a logjam where his players couldn’t develop as well since it was hard to get on the court. Unless they went current Cavs style. Hinkie went 1-3 in top 6 picks, 1 of his busts was a decent player and one was unplayable, he should have seen Okafor wouldn’t have worked if he was in on analytics, he didn’t get good value for MCW and it’s really weird to boot a player after 1 year, and he took a big when he had 3. Top 3 picks are supposed to be game changing. Giannis wasn’t. If you gave a 6 year old the choice he would’ve taken Embiid. Embiid was thought to be the #1 pick earlier in the draft process. It’s like applauding the Rockets for taking Jalen Green."
The only one out of that list I see getting there is Edwards just based on raw talent. Maybe Jalen Green. The rest I doubt will be top 10.
"True, but Morey had the opportunity to pair Joel Embiid with James Harden and let that slip because he didn’t want to include 2 more assets.   And Houston ended up with an awful team that landed them Jalen Green. Philly lost."
Improved efficiency and less turnovers from KP  Roy for Jalen Green  Healthy season from C Wood
"Agree with most of the above, especially Herro, Russell, Kuzma &amp; Irving.   Some others :  - Michael “Curious Mike” Porter Jr.  - Gary Trent Jr.  - Spencer Dinwiddie - Danny Green (love the guy, but corncob city) - Dennis Schroeder  - Jalen Green - Danuel House - Grant Williams  - Robin Lopez - CJ McCollum - Jalen Suggs - Ben Simmons - Marquese Chriss  - Patrick Patterson"
"Damn, straight. I’m going to watch Houston games because their an interesting team to watch, having so many promising young players, but also for Jalen Green in those short shorts."
"Jalen Green was measured as 6’4” barefoot when he was 16.  He’s listed as 6’6” now so I assume he is at least 6’5” in reality, so the dudes statement seems accurate."
&gt; Jalen Green who is 6’6  Nobody tell him.
His taller than Jalen Green who is 6’6 so it makes sense
just asked my roommate who is a soccer fan if he knows jalen green he said no  i asked him if he knew jalen suggs and he said yes because he watched the final four  you are delusional and blinded by being a rockets fan
Jalen Green has 1.5ig followers lmao
Yeah most of us know Jalen Green for getting 81 dropped on his head but he was a star from his Fab Four days long before. They even bring it up a few times in the article and it's crazy to see the numbers that team seemed to pull in.
"Brother Jalen Green has a huge platform, a lot bigger than Suggs, was the first big time rookie to join the gleague and was the higher pick in the draft idk what ur saying  Jalen has 150k on twitter  Suggs has 50k   Green has 1.4M on instagram  Suggs has 500k"
ask your average sports fan if they know who jalen green is  then ask your average sports fan if they know who jalen suggs is  oh yeah he's the guy who played for the #1 ncaa bball team most of the year and hit that crazy game winner in the final four  you know i'm right
Lol idc bout no thumbnail but Jalen Green is like 100x more popular than Suggs
Bruh how is Jalen Suggs in the thumbnail over Jalen Green
"In this case Basketball IQ is the biggest swing factor. Jalen Green is the smarter player, more effective, more efficient, and and isn’t a high level bad shot maker. I also think Green is a better shooter than Edwards.  Like you said both have similar play styles and I’d bet both will be perennial stars but I think green has that slight edge over him when talking about future projection"
"Ceiling is what makes this answer pretty clear imo.  Anthony Edwards could honestly be very close to Dwyane Wade, there are some difference, Edwards has higher shooting upside because he can shoot 3’s, but Wade was one of the smartest and most cerebral players ever with a an old school KG-Kobe will to win.  Jalen Green has very high upside but it isn’t comparable to any top 30 players of all time.  He could be a top 10 players in the league for sure though."
Everyone is going to say Ant here because they’ve seen him play an NBA season but Jalen Green is and was 100% the better prospect.
Morey doesn't like trading unprotected picks. The whole reason we have Jalen Green is because he threw top 4 protection on a pick swap that wasn't expected to convey.
I think Jalen Green has potential to be better at almost everything except having the strength Edwards has. His shooting will open up his game a lot more  But I’m biased
Hard to say. Ant looked good the last half of the season. But I really like Jalen Green. I'd probably lean Green right now
"I agree, if the Rockets did trade for Ben they likely dont land Jalen Green or a top 3 pick."
"Plus the Jaylens, Jalen green."
idek lol   before Jalen Green our last lottery pick was Yao Ming 💀  Before Yao our last top 10 pick was Hakeem
"KPJ is one of those guys that has an unbelievable amount of talent, was playing in the Drew League in high school. All that hype can die down real quick though without the right support system, the NBA is too talented and the competition is ruthless if you aren’t on point with your life. Read that the Rockets have an assistant coach that was going to support him, looks like that’s been a good move for him.   I do wonder how this season is going to go though with Jalen Green in the mix. See how much growing up MPJ has actually done when he has to give up touches/shots to a younger player. Didn’t go so well when he was in a different situation in Cleveland."
"Compared to 2 of the top 5 draft picks of next year's class, Jalen Green is:     Only 3 months older than Chet Holmgren  Only 10 days older than Jaden Ivey"
Is it time to start worrying about Jalen Green?
Jalen Green is a vision.  this rockets team is really fun to watch.
"Arguably even louder every bucket Jalen Green got, this guy's gonna be special"
"In other news, the demise of Jayson Tatum and Jalen Green was greatly overstated."
For Jalen Green to get 30 without free throws is insane and awesome. And Sengun is just pure heart.
"Rockets y'all got a real good one, Jalen Green is a baller. Sengun looked good too"
Yes Jalen Green but I just wanna say Alperen Sengun is gonna be an insane player
Jalen Green
Where were you when Jalen Green saved basketball and the world?
You'd think with all the Jalen Green hype post that Houston would have won
"dude we're internet sports fans, what are we without overreactions  anyway, jalen green would be a hall of famer if he retired today"
JALEN GREEN
Jalen Green
"“Jalen Green started slowly” “I want to thank Rockets for drafting Jalen over Mobley” I’m not saying Jalen is going to be the second coming of Kobe, but people overreact and write off players too early. Only been 3-4 games and people are already declaring the next HoFers and busts"
Jalen Green release
This Jalen Green guy is pretty good
I love Jalen green
Broke the Rockets rookie record for 3s in a game  The break out game baby  Jalen Green has arrived 😤
I'm ready for the Anthony Edwards vs. Jalen Green dunk contest
"I agree, Jalen Green should have passed out so someone could isolate in the mid range and shoot a good old fashioned contested jumper. Or maybe so that someone could post up and then get the good old bank shot. Just fundamentals amirite"
Holy shit Jalen Green is fun to watch
JALEN. GREEN.
Jalen Green is about to score 30 because he is feeling it
I just came from watching Jalen Green this quarter. Dude is out here putting on a show!
SGA is hella smooth. Jalen Green looks like he will be someday too.
Jalen Green heard yall talkin shit
I just wanna see Jalen Green iso lmfao
Whats up with rookies shitting on the Celtics? First Scottie Barnes and now Jalen Green
Jalen Green en fuego 🔥
&gt;Green v Sengun  Damn hopefully Sengun doesn't leave to have a rivalry with Jalen
Jalen Green plays at 125% speed
Jalen Green
Jalen Green with the 3 bomb prayer
First Rockets game of the season I'm watching. Hoping for a big game from Jalen Green.
Yes but Jalen green is the player that needs the biggest ramp up now. Lowest on the development curve  I’ll be pretty shocked if he isn’t given the chance to win roy
Would be fun to see Jalen Green just explode this game
Because http://www.homeexerciseequipmenthq.com/jalen-green-vertical-jump/ is a legit source right? Take this L
"literally google “Jalen Green vert in inches” and it will come up in big bold letters, reckon you can handle that big boy?"
Dude just glides down the court. The little bit I've seen from Jalen Green looks similar too. Lanky dudes that play on springs.
Why have they not handed Jalen green the offense .. it’s actually ridiculous
I love that Cleveland are giving him major minutes and running plays for him  Jalen Green has not been that involved in the offense
"I mean Jalen Green is the player to watch. That doesn’t mean he is the best or will be the best, but his athleticism makes him the most exciting for me. Like the man tried to baptize someone in his second game."
"Theory 1: Mobley's family connections to KPJ had Evan saying he wouldn't go to Houston anyway (he refused to work out for them).  Theory 2: Stone liked Green more.  Also, I doubt they were considering fit with Wood on any level in their draft prep. I think it is most likely that the athleticism and **mentality** Jalen possesses turned Stone's eye. Also, Houston's FO has kind of favored guards over bigs in recent years."
"Rockets fan here, supporting Jalen Green.  I love that Mobley has gotten off to a great start.  I truly think that the ‘21 draft class might be in the same conversation as ‘84 when all is said and done.  So much talent with great potential on so many teams.  Good time to be a basketball fan."
"People honestly put way too much stock into summer league.   Not saying Jalen Green won't be good, but I think people were too quick to conclude that he was the player to watch. It seems like a pretty even draft at the top."
Read that as Jalen Green for a sec and was so so confused.
"That's where I'm at. If you're having to choose between Evan Mobley and Jalen Green, then you'll be making a great choice no matter what. Both will be great"
"Evan Mobley sure, Jalen green I’m not so sure"
He’s so good and I’m so mad I drafted Jalen Green over him in fantasy 😭
I think Jalen Green will consistently be all nba and one of the best scorers in the league. I think Evan Mobley will be a all-nba and All-Defense on a regular basis. No team made the wrong decision in my eyes
Evan Mobley and Jalen green may have something to say about that
Edwards or Jalen Green
"Jalen Green has insane athleticism, saw replay of him nearly hop outta the arena saving a pass in preseason. It was unnatural how high he climbed that ladder."
"Anthony edwards, jalen green, and me"
Jalen Green for a bad reason I have nothing against him it’s just his fanboys on Instagram are gay for him
oh i know jalen green was blowin this page up too. but he was doin cool shit scottie barnes be makin layups and dumpoff passes 🤣
"Y'know, Jalen Green might be able to learn a thing or two from this guy."
Jalen Green
Jalen Green  Josh Green  Javonte Green  Jamychal Green  Jeff Green
Definitely not Jalen Green.  The Rockets will be doomed as long as Fertitta is owner
same Jalen Green who was 4/11 today and 4/14 the 1st game?  Jalen Green is still raw rn
Jalen green vs 4 top 75 players?
"Memphis is solid, Pop can coach any team to win, and the Rockets may try to send a message with Jalen Green. Those won’t be easy wins."
When this guy was a sophomore I became friends with a guy who was a long time Highschool basketball ref in NorCal. He told me to start following this kid out of Fresno because he was the craziest talent he had seen since Jason Kidd. Jalen Green has been a beast forever and I can’t wait to see him explode in the NBA.
Jalen Green Mantis
Is it just me or is there something unique about the way Jalen Green moves?
Let him learn to play off ball and in a system. Once it’s clear we’re not super competitive at the all star break we can make the Jalen Green ROY push
Jalen Green and KPJ played some good defense today  Benefit of having a 6’6 backcourt. It’s all effort
"Jalen Green is not one dimensional… Anyway, I’m not surprised about Mobley. He was my ideal pick for the Raptors."
Jalen Green turned the ball over*
#Scottie Barnes &gt;&gt;&gt; Your favourite rookie not named Jalen Green
Jalen Green honestly reminds me of a better Gerald Green tbh
Looks like if Jalen Green had an older bro
"He had a midrange with Hunter behind him and Capela trying to close out that was a clean look. Overall they played him well. I think the key with Luka is cutting off easy passes and forcing him to create his own shot all game or allow his teammates to create offense when he passes out. You end up tiring him out from him having to constantly work hard for his points or make his teammates beat you which they don’t really have the talent to do. I have no skin in the game between MAVs and Hawks, I understand though why Hawks fans go out of there way to try and pick apart Luka when he doesn’t play well after all the talk about how they traded away the Luka pick for Trae. Shit, I already do the same thing with Jalen Green since everyone already seems to believe that he is better than Cade."
"I’m sorry, but one game into the season isn’t enough to say this is a poor version of shooters around Luka. THJ was one of the best shooters in the NBA last year. DFS and maxi are experts at hitting corner 3’s, KP stretches the floor, and we replaced James Johnson and Josh richardson with Bullock and Brown who both shot better than 40% on 3 on more than 10 attempts a game combined.   Like, is this a championship roster? No. But Luka/THJ/bullock/DFS/KP  With Jalen/brown/green/maxi/Dwight off the bench, that’s a great shooting starting lineup. You can criticize interior defense and playmaking, but we have shooting."
"Ok I thought I was the only one. I was thinking of making a post. A lotta lottery picks really struggled too even for rookie debuts too.   Some non rookies and their fg numbers in their opening games:   Steph against the lakers: 5/21 FVV: 5/20 OG Anunoby: 3/17 Tatum: 7/30 Lauri: 4/14 JJJ: 3/12 Valanciunas: 3/19 (2/16 from 2, how does a huge 7 footer miss 14 shots from 2? Only 2fts too) Cole Anthony: 3/12 Mike Conley: 4/12 D Book: 3/15 Dame: 8/24 (0/9 from 3, missed the potentially game tying shot) K Midd: 4/14 Kristaps: 4/14 Finney-Smith: 2/12  Some rookie debuts: Jalen Suggs: 3/14, 1 assist, 3 TOs Jalen Green: 4/14 Scottie Barnes: 5/13, 1 assist, 6 TOs  Not so critical of the rooks cause they’re rooks but it did seem like a lotta people put up stinkers. Obviously some great performances like from Bron and Jaylen Brown but seems like more bad ones than is normal."
First game of his career but Jalen Green was a -37 last night
"Thanks for the support y'all! I know Mobley was picked 3rd in a solid draft but despite that I personally feel like he's being slept on here at Reddit over Scottie and Jalen Green. I think he's a unicorn in training, and will end up somewhere between theoretical Tingus Pingus and a Giannis/KD hybrid if he fulfills his potential. Homer take, I know!"
He def has good chances just depends on the opportunity when Levert &amp; Warren come back  Jalen Green is really raw so he’s definitely not the runaway ROY like many here said
Jalen Green is shooting like a blind man.
"That seems like a meaningless distinction to make, though, and it completely ignores that the point of having young players is to accrue stars, not role players.   The group of Luka, Moses brown, Tyrell Terry, Jalen brunson, Frank and Josh green is likely to see way more success over the next 5 years than the OKC group.   The OKC group is only a better core if your goal is to have a bunch of good players and turn into the Pacers and be a fun team to watch with 0 playoff equity."
Chris Duarte is gonna win ROTY. At least in the buzz. I watched Jalen Green and he's raw af. Duarte is so smooth off the dribble and catch. He honestly should replace Levert
there aren’t any guards in the league who are friends of the Cavs.  All the good ones pop off against us.  Watch Jalen Green will have a breakout game against us

Jalen Green was built in a lab to make buckets
"If only they were all on Houston they could triple up with Jalen. They night even be able to swing the trade for Josh green from Dallas and Javonte green from the Bulls. They could legitimately get J. Green, J. Green, J. Green, J. Green, and J. Green on the court"
"Anyone else see some Jimmy Butler, kinda, in Jalen Green?"
"When it reaches THT or Caruso levels that the Lakers were doing, then y'all can talk about us posting Barnes highlights. If one highlight of him scoring his first NBA points got you like this man oh man there are two posts of Jalen Green I hope you ain't having a stroke or something my guy.  Ain't nobody triggered or crying. I just think it's ironic and funny that it was a Celtics fan complaining cause they did the **EXACT** same thing with Tatum and to an even larger degree than anything Raptors fans have done with Barnes. But I guess pointing that out is being triggered now. Maybe you gotta try not getting so triggered by seeing posts from the second largest fanbase on NBA reddit, try that big fella."
"The stats won’t show it today, Jalen Green is going to be gooooooood. Dude just creates space effortlessly."
Welcome to the NBA Jalen Green
Has Jalen Green ever made a pass?
Jalen “Greenlight” Green🏀
Once Jalen Green learns to play in control he's gonna be nasty. Right now he's just always at 100mph
Where will you be when Jalen Green saves the NBA?
Not so much matchups but a team; I’m curious to see the Rockets. My 2K player was drafted to the Rockets and I’ve been having a ball slapping teams around with Christian Wood and that boss Jalen Green.
He literally has the green light with Jalen Green. Why wouldn’t he be a contender to breakout? Last year he was impressive.
"Malachi Flynn and Jalen Green.   Easy, next question."
Jalen Green is from California though.
jalen green was two years old when still tippin' came out. I wonder what's the likelihood that he has ever listened to these artists?
"at least u dont have a point guard who turns the ball over half the time and doesnt pass to jalen green and shoots 36 percent from the field and says ""imma average 10 assist this season"""
Jalen Green is my horse for ROY. No cap.
"The only one comparable athletically imo is Jalen Green but Ant is bigger, stronger"
"Jalen Green, while in transition, beat a backpedaling Cade Cunningham for a Dunk and started yelling shit at Cade to (imo) try and rally his team, it didn't work as the Pistons ended up winning the game."
Jalen Green. lol.
Ok. Monk for SGA or Jalen Green.
and jalen green isn’t one of them lmao
For real. I get the narrative of #1 vs #2 pick but both of those teams are not ready for that kind of limelight. I do love me some Jalen Green tho ngl. Hopefully someone flexes in a couple Bulls games.
SOLD on Jalen Green after seeing this. Big time 90’s NBA-type energy
You’re going no where with this. Detroit hating Jalen Green is the result of Jalen Greens actions. Period
"- anyone who didn’t watch will look at the stationery and think they had similar games… Jalen Green was giving Cade the blues for most of the game  - Silas has to do a better job. Those guys were playing keep away from the hottest hand in green. KPJ stunk the joint   - I love Cade, but he needs to attack the rim more often.   - Is Woods allergic to post ups?"
Silas hates Jalen Green
[Oh well](https://sports.yahoo.com/rockets-jalen-green-didn-t-194331026.html)
This sub when ppl say Jalen Green needs to chill out about being taken 2nd: My goodness why are you guys so soft? Do you guys not know what being competitive is?  Also this sub when OP says Karma is a bitch: Jalen got you pressed lmaooo
Jalen green so athletic man as well. Hope both teams get better soon and meet up in the finals someday
Jalen Green is LA bound suck it 😭😭
[Highlight] Jalen Green caps off his scoring for the night with 3:43 to go in the 3rd
im so fucking pissed i clicked a jalen green thread and cades stats are no where to be found
"Really, what on earth happened in the 4th to give Eric Gordon more ball handling than Jalen Green??"
Cade Cunningham has double the career wins that Jalen Green has. That’s my GOAT 😤
"*Jalen Green has 23 points through 3 quarters on 8-16 shooting*  Rest of the Rockets: ""Ight, better not pass to him."""
My boy case had to clamp Jalen green again there geez
"Jalen Green has the raw athleticism and aggressive mindset to become a star.  Cade Cunningham has the sound fundamentals, workmanlike approach to his game and is constantly wanting to take coaching to become an all-around star.  It's going to be fun to watch both of their respective developments."
Cade is closing while Jalen Green isn’t shooting
Yea kpj seems to be a redundancy for you guys with Jalen green. I don’t think green and kpj work together and I would much rather have green
The difference is Jalen green isnt kicking everyone’s ass right away like Jordan did. Jordan backed it up
Jalen Green definitely has a chip on his shoulder
"""Jalen green was in his bag 🥶"" captioning a highlight step back post while he went 3-16 on the game"
jalen green really want that anime rivalry lol
"damn didn't know there was so much Pistons bias in this thread, have y'all not seen any Jalen Green? Man dropped 30 in his third NBA game and Cade still celebrating shooting 6-17"
I think it’s hilarious that there was a 50% chance that Pistons fans would be defending Jalen Green and Rockets fans would be talking about how they live in Pistons fans heads rent free. Just zero perspective on this sub. Can we just enjoy both of these great young rookies?
"Jalen Green seems insecure af 😂 unfortunately for him, we'll take the W tonight"
"I don’t understand why pistons fans are so pissy about Jalen green. He’s 19 and he’s competitive, relax"
"Jalen green may be a superstar one day or he may not, but one thing is for certain: he's going to think he's a superstar."
Lmfao Jalen green
Jalen Green getting a taunting penalty for screaming at Cade Cunningham is the least surprising thing ever.
Jalen Green seems gives off big dickhead energy IMO idk
Jalen Green is gonna be a star and I can’t wait
Jalen green is garbage!
"TFW you fucking hate the Rockets, but love Jalen Green."
I need a Jalen green explosion
Cade vs Jalen Green. #1 pick vs #2 pick
KPJ and Jalen Green being two separate people is fucking up Dave Pasch rn
"Where will you be when Jalen Green saves the NBA, and thus, the world?"
"Tough to say, says there's only 1 inch and 10 lbs between the two.   We just saw a 37 year old Lebron beat Jalen Green(who many think is the most athletic player in the draft class) in a foot race.   Lebron doesn't make sense, I don't think we'll see an athlete like that again."
West Steph Curry Jalen Green Jae'Sean Tate Christian Wood Alpen Sengun  dont care about the east.  Would have had KPJ as the PG but he's been battling injuries and steph has been slightly better.
"as listening to all the smoke today and they had Jalen green @ #1 giving all sorts of non-sensical reasons why Barnes + Mobley such as 'Jalen green isnt even the first option on his team, while Barnes + Mobley getting way more touches""  Like wtf, you can easily look up usage rates...and how TF are Barnes and Mobley the #1 options on their team, TF..."
"i'm great at bad jokes and bad trolling, so don't worry i empathize. rooting for jalen green boss"
"Unfortunately, the only thing Jalen Green is good at right now is jumping"
I’m surprised they didn’t overreact to a few good Jalen Green games and put him on the list
"Top two picks Cade Cunningham and Jalen Green going up against each other in that game. And people have been hyping up a baby beef between them which seems entirely artificial, but I'm here for it either way. So yeah we both suck, but it's gonna be entertaining as hell anyway."
I thought he had a nice play vs the warriors on that massive jalen green slam dunk  It was a transition dunk and KPJ got back and set a screen that caught both draymond and steph giving jalen a wide open lane
He has a better PER than Cade Cunningham. Who I’m guessing doesn’t have enough minutes to qualify for this stat. And is functionally identical to Jalen Green.
"Not gonna lie, I love Evan Mobley's potential. The worst player I'd take above him is probably like Jaylen Brown.  If you asked me pre-draft, I would have preferred the known abilities and potential of SGA over what I presumed Cade/Jalen Green to be."
Jalen Green is also like 5th bottom in all these stats
"Yeah that’s probably a big part of it. Most people think Jalen Green was more nba ready than Mobley, but the lack of strength has hurt Green way more"
"Vecenie didn't even have him top 10 pre-college, we're not talking about pre-college, we're talking about during the college season  &gt; Even during the college season that was the idea  Not really, a lot of people bumped him up to #2 during the college season and then dropped him again to #4 after it ended. Some even had him flirting with #1  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10000840-2021-nba-draft-rumors-gm-would-consider-jalen-suggs-for-no-1-overall-pick  You act like it was so much more clear when it wasn't. Wasserman had him as #2 on his BB last April. That's just hindsight to say he was a clear 4 all year  Green/Mobley didn't slip but most had Suggs in the same tier as them"
Wagner behind Cade and Jalen Green lol. ROY is basically best Top 10 draft bc everyone else just gets overlooked
"I know my point is with silas hes not getting enough opportunity to run the offense and such. KPJ is not a point guard and we gotta stop running him as one. I dont think silas is the worst coach ever, but jalen green needs more shots and thats not happening rn."
"We didn’t draft friggin Haliburton! Ball wasn’t miles away the better prospect it was a hot debate. Even closer than arguing Jalen Green and Evan Mobley as prospects. We took the same level of prospect and a way better fit. I don’t think Jerry West would literally waste a pick on a backup, taking a risk that he may never be able to shoot nor defend."
Jalen Green is part Pinoy. Easy choice there for the Houston Rockets
Jalen green and Kevin porter jr all I’m saying   + Tate and sengun Lowkey
Rockets want the ball in the hands of Kevin Porter Jr and Jalen Green. Trying to get them all the play making reps they can to develop them.   I don't think it's his decision. Team doesn't want him to play bc they want to develop young guys and lose games.
Meanwhile I'm suffering through the Jalen Green experience in the worst way.
"Yes, but they would have won more games and potentially not gotten their pick(no Jalen Green). It was risk to tank given they weren’t guaranteed their own pick but it was worth taking."
"KPJ is not a point guard. People keep saying give it time but it’s just not natural   Just because he can pass, doesn’t mean he’s a PG. They are not only halting his development but but Jalen Green too  He needs to focus on scoring"
"Yeah, It seems pretty clear if you did a redraft today the pistons take Mobley or Barnes #1 (I'd take Barnes). Obviously Cade and Jalen Green could pass them back but Mobley and Barnes look like sure things"
Rockets rlly took Jalen Green over Mobley
Who would you rather hear about jalen green and his stellar performance tonight
this Jalen green dude 😭😭😭
Evan Mobley: 13.8/7.9/2.3/1/1.3 on 49.1/15.4/78.8 shooting.  Scottie Barnes: 17.6/8.9/2.3 on 52.1/22.2/70.8 shooting.  Chris Duarte: 16.1/4.4/2.4/1 on 44.3/42.4/92.3 shooting.  Jalen Green (oof he has bad shooting splits but he's not out of the ROTY picture):  14.1/3.4/3.1 on 35.5/29.7/73.3 shooting.  Jalen Suggs (same comment as for Green): 12.6/3.3/3.4 on 31/22.8/84.6 shooting.  Franz Wagner: 14.5/3.5/1.9/1.1 on 47.5/39.6/66.7.  Guys like Giddey and Davion Mitchell are both averaging around 10 ppg and can creep into the contenders as the season goes on as well.
Is it just me or do a lot of rockets players ice out Jalen green
I don't watch a lot of rockets games but is that a common sentiment? I recall most people being high on Christian Wood and KPJ and Jalen Green and Sengun seem to show promise.
People are hating on Jalen green for no reason.
Its early but I truly believe Mobley and Scottie are gonna be the two generational players of this draft. Jalen Green will be nasty too but Cade and Suggs won't be much more than fringe/low level all star guys.. this might be the best class in the past 5 years
Jalen green sucks
"Does Jalen Green ever pass, jesus."
feels like every warriors basket is jalen green getting burnt on d
It’s hilarious that the rockets fans spent half their offseason shitting on this guy for no reason because the FO happened to decide to take Jalen Green (who as an aside I think will also be a good player) instead. I’ve never seen a fan base act so obnoxious for a last place team and so viscerally target a guy that has nothing to do with their team
"I could have picked Scottie, but another dude picked him before me. Instead I got Jalen Green and Mobley. Can't say I'm too disappointed, but I could have had all 3 ROTY front runners"
"Look at Jalen Green in Houston, thats what happens when you give a rookie no vets or an actually pg. Playing with vets and good players is better for Scottie's development"
"Jalen Green has potential, and he will probably be one of the best players in the class eventually, but he isn’t that good right now. If his shot isn’t falling, he can’t score because of how weak and frail he is. His playmaking ability out of the pick and roll has been a bit of a surprise, but that isn’t enough to call him a top three rookie 9 games in."
Jalen Green
Jalen Green played just 14 games or so.
cannot be caping for jalen green and making fun of another player's efficiency. I'd rather have 17 points on 17 shots than 10 points on 16 shots.
"No they aren’t. Silas literally pulled Jalen Green with 2:30 left in the fourth for EG. We’re tanking anyway, at least we could let Jalen try to close out a game on his own. He’s the future of the team, no need to baby him."
"This year Rockets rookie guard Jalen Green, forsure the best player to watch from the last draft"
He’s not a PG.   Rather bring back John Wall again  Jalen Green is a better point guard than KPJ at this point
People are gonna give me some shit for saying this but I think the Rockets should look into trading for a pass first PG then move KPJ over to SF. I love it that KPJ has done his to modify his game in order to play alongside Jalen Green but I think he would thrive much better if he didn’t have the responsibility of being the primary playmaker.
Jalen Green is really handsome damn
"So uhhh, is Kevin Porter jr. ok and why is he getting clutch minutes over Jalen Green??  I enjoyed watching this Rockets team a lot, especially Alperen, but KPJ is a problem and not in a good way lol"
"I have to admit, my concern for Jalen Green is now at a 2/10.   The thing which I've noticed which I don't feel like others have talked about is that it really feels like he needs a runway. When he gets it, he can do crazy shit with it like that dunk where his face was at the rim. But what you see from the really athletic players is that they can take off instantly (was just thinking about Rose's famous dunk on Dragic as an example), and I don't really feel like I've seen that from him."
"KPJ has no business being a point guard, Jalen Green has many glaring issues, Silas is atrocious, Sengun's positive impact is so noticeable, Theis and Gordon's trade value going up."
I’m guessing Jalen Green was benched the last 2mins because he’s a defensive liability
why is kpj in the game over jalen green at the end?
yea i’m betting on you not knowing shit and jalen green will end up being better
"I mean it just wasn’t a smart pick, Jalen Green can maybe turn into Zach Lavine where as Mobley can be AD without the injury issues."
"Jalen Green is so meh, should have taken Mobley."
"Jalen Green is a bust, sadly"
For sure. I’ve seen some write off Jalen as being a worse pick than Mobley already and it’s just like.. Green has struggled but he’s also shown massive upside. It’s wild to me.
"I’m on board with this but i think internally there are certain pressures to play their three “stars” in wood, kpj, and green. All three should be coming off the bench in a stable, competitive team. Green has the potential to be a starter and Wood has to be efficient again to be considered one. Problem is, theis and tate are your best defenders and having to start green wood and jalen (by design, pressure from fanbase, fo, etc.) force the coaches’ hand to play these non shooting defensive minded role players. Fit sucks all in all and it’s so hard to do mental gymnastics just to make things “work” pronto. It’s been said ad nauseum but u gotta get rid of that owner and maybe criticize the FO more for these questionable moves/picks."
"Jalen Green, still upset about not being the number 1 pick, punching air right now."
Depends on if rookie Jalen Green is better than rookie Kemba Walker or Jahil Okafor.
"I went to the Celtics rockets game, it was stupid how little Jalen Green was involved and it was clear that Sengun should at least be starting. Being terrible is one thing but you want players to show their capabilities or young players to improve on their weaknesses."
"Jalen is 100% not worth it.  Turner also have 2 years left on the contract so we shouldnt give everything to get him.  2 1st round picks, DFS, Josh Green and Moses Brown may do it. Specially if Turner doesnt plan to resign."
"Excuse me but their half court offence is literally on the level of the process 76ers. You can't tell me Jalen Green,KPJ,Wood,Theis,Sengun,Eric Gordon,etc should result in that level of basketball.  They have lack of playmaking on the roster but they have a few guys who like the 76ers now could function as a PG as a group."
"he might be a bad coach but i feel like their roster is the reason for their horrific start   their 5 leading minutes guys are Christian Wood, Jalen Green, KPJ, Eric Gordon and Jae’sean tate. in what world was that team ever going to be competitive lol  maybe a better coach is like 3-14? maybe?? idk lol   again i’m not against firing him if they think he sucks. it’s just that roster is fuckin terrible"

"National Media been disrespectful towards cade I’m not gonna lie. On another note, Basketball is covered so ugly in the national media. The industry is just full of guys who wanna be right about their predictions or just pick on any player and establish a narrative about them. It’s even worse with the social media age now because ESPN interns will go on Twitter and fall for whatever a troll might say about a certain player and then relay that message back to ESPN and now you got people saying that Cade doesn’t have the same “hunger” as Jalen Green"

Nekias Duncan Duncan said he sees some Jamal Crawford in Jalen Green
Jalen Green looks like someone who screams that he’s from the streets but grew up in an upper middle class neighborhood
hahahaha you fool you buffoon you chump  imagine thinking anyone can deny jalen green harder than our own coach is already denying him
lol in b4 jordan poole denies jalen green just like steph did to harden
"Seen this a couple times, just realized that jalen green, jalen suggs, and scottie barnes are there in the background watching haha"
"The ceiling I tried to keep it realistic, I'm not doing the ""if this not really athletic guy suddenly becomes athletic"" or stuff like that  &amp;#x200B;  **Cade**  Floor : good starter with no big weakness, not an ultra reliable shot creator, but clearly a + player on a good team  Ceiling : Khris Middleton with a better handle/passing, mid tier all star  &amp;#x200B;  **Jalen Green**   Floor : bench gunner, able to get a lot of points quickly, but just a meh playmaker and a total 0 at everything else  Ceiling : efficient 25+ppg guy, decent on ball defender, good passer for a 2, one of the most spectacular player of all time, rich man's Lavine  &amp;#x200B;  **Mobley** :  Floor : jack of all trades master of none big who can be a legit all defense level guy, not enough of a shot creator on offense to be considered a true superstar by casuals, but advanced stats darling  Ceiling : Best defender in the league, and efficient 20ppg guy who can do everything good on the basketball court, the new Kevin Garnett, in an era when he can play center which makes him valuable, MVP level impact  &amp;#x200B;  **Barnes :**  Floor : great connector, good starter, can be a tough fit because of his spot up shooter,  but so versatile that any team can use him  Ceiling : his shot improves enough, clear all star, can do everything on the court, even if he's not that good as a shot creator, can become some sort of Shawn Marion/Kirilenko type player (in an era when it's even more valuable)  &amp;#x200B;  Didn't really get the chance to see the other rookies enough to really have a judgement on them"
I said this before but the floor of Jalen Green is 6moty Clarkson in terms of skills and effectiveness which is really good. Got downvoted a lot tho.
"u/keonjohnson , Antman, Zion(When he was 280) , jalen green, Ja, and Lavine."
"The Rockets badly need him to play, not just to look like a functional team, but also to properly develop Jalen Green. He needs a point guard to hit him in his spots and simplify the game for him. The Rox are fucking up his development."
"A ton of fans hate casey as well and underrate him lol. They also question his rotations (he doesnt even play Kelly solid minutes, for me 22-25 is too low). Imo it’s a combination of the rockets god awful bench and its god awful negative players. I might get a lot of hate but CW can be a good player but is a negative rn, KPJ is without a doubt a negative. Jalen Green is a negative (he has potential and i hope he improves but its tough to expect much from the dude and with a redraft i wont get him at 2) so yeah. A lot of negative dudes. Theis is really good (role player) but your fanbase and pundits don’t like Silas playing him as well lol.   Tldr; winning players thrive in winning environments. It’s hard to be impactful when your team as a whole sucks. Cade and Giddey are suffering from this as well. Rockets need to overhaul this team, they have a ton of negative assets which will make it hard for them to do so. They had a top 5 player, gm, and coach (arguably) a few seasons ago obv you’ll suck if you lose all three but coaching aint the main issue."
"His TS% was subpar in two out of his three college seasons and didn't get good until he was older than the rest of his competition, he should not be expected to be an efficient offensive player in the NBA.  But a ton of rookies basically do nada to start their careers.  Of course, most don't amount to that much, but it is hardly unusual for a rookie to have bad efficiency.  Among other lotto picks, Suggs, Kuminga, Ziaire Williams, Moody, Jalen Green all have bad TS% as well and Primo hasn't even gotten playing time."
We don’t have much but… 1. Alperen Sengun 2. Jalen Green 3. Kevin Porter Jr. 4. Christian Wood 5. Josh Christopher 6. Usman Garuba 7. Kenyon Martin Jr. 8. Jae’sean Tate
Idk but Jalen Green jumps off my screen everytime I see him take off
"Well, so much for that ""KPJ was holding back Jalen Green"" theory..."
"if I was houston Id want to keep KPJ away from jalen green.   could be a bad influence, KPJ already almost caught felony gun charges and he has a history of immaturity  keep him away from green until he shows attitude and decisionmaking improvement over a long period of time"
My students got mad at me for saying Evan Mobley was playing better than Jalen Green so I gotta bust out some stats tomorrow so my kids know that I know my shit lmao
I’ve been there plenty to see how insecure they are about Jalen Green as well actually. Just insecure fans tbh
"Some that come to mind.  If you're a bigger scoring guard that can run PnR and shoot 3s you're Harden/Ginobili (especially if you're lefty). Examples: Jaden Hardy, DLo, Luka, Cade.  If you're a skilled off ball guard that can shoot you're Ray Allen/Klay/Beal and recently Lavine. Examples: Jalen Green, Buddy Hield, Malik Monk, Booker, Mclemore.  If you're an undersized but strong and long two guard who can't shoot well you're Wade. Examples: Jaden Ivey, Marcus Smart, Donovan Mitchell, Oladipo, Anthony Edwards.  If you're an explosive and fast PG, you're Rose. Examples: Wall, Fox, Morant. Maybe Westbrook, Baron Davis, and Steve Francis are other common comps.  If you're a PnR playmaking PG that can't shoot, you're Rondo. Examples: Schroeder, Kris Dunn, Elfrid Payton, Ntilikina."
1. Evan Mobley  2. Scottie Barnes  3. Franz Wagner  4. Cade Cunningham   5. Chris Duarte   6. Josh Giddey  7. Davion Mitchell   8. Herb Jones  9. Alperen Sengun   10a. Jalen Suggs  10b. Jalen Green  12. Austin Reeves  13. Ayo Dosunmo  14. Jeremiah Robinson-Earl  15. Dalano Banton  16. Bones Hyland
Jalen Green really ain’t gonna like this.
Jalen Green not gonna like this.
I’ll trade Jalen green for Andrew Wiggins
He thinks he’s Jalen Green
"Not all young players are in the same situation as they are on the Rockets where they’re given reps to work through mistakes as they lead the team to a 1-15 record.   I doubt guys like Jalen Green or KPJ would be in the Celtics rotation much more if at all than they are. Rookie Jaylen Brown had better efficiency and advanced stats than both with similar per 100 numbers by this point in the season and overall. And yet by the new year of his rookie season, he was averaging just a bit over 13 mpg over his first 34 games. Priorities are different on different teams."
Primo that can’t even use his left hand is gonna be better than Jalen Green?  Hilarious
"Cam Thomas. Hot take, but he's going to be a better pure scorer than Jalen Green in about 7 years."
Lol we got Jalen Green and Sengun in the same draft  Hope we can add Chet/Ivey/Banchero to the mix
Wtf yall taking about this boys official height is 6’4. I feel like I’m on crazy pills. Whered these 6’7 numbers come from  https://www.nba.com/player/1630224/jalen-green
Green? As in Jalen Green? He's at 49 TS%. 36 is historically bad. No idea where you got that from.
They don’t need to be giving Eric Gordon minutes to try and win them the game. They don’t care if they lose. They need to let Jalen Green and their young guys develop and you don’t do that by running every play for EG. Rockets aren’t trying to win
Teams know who John Wall is as a player. They would have to take rotation minutes from KPJ or Jalen Green in order for Wall to play.
They look extremely bad. Kpj is not looking nearly like I thought he would. And jalen is having a bad season. Especially being that he has the green light to go off. I was rooting for both of them.
"We're not enjoyable to watch because of gameplans and rotations, not necessarily due to our players. Jalen Green and Sengun and few others are the bright spots of watching the team"
Jalen green certainly isn’t treated like the franchise player mainly by his teammates and why that hasn’t been communicated by Silas and upper management stupefies me as Fertitta literally flew with him to the draft.  And yeah Sengun should definitely be starting and the rockets should be looking to offload vets for picks
Jalen Green is the worst starter in the league right now.  You trading him for Christian Wood?
"Another day without KPJ, another good Jalen Green game.  Play KPJ in 2 unit, Start Green, and let Augustin/Wall helps Green PG duties and Rockets will be Fine and Win more games  Rooting for some Rockets wins 🤘"
KPJ at the 2 and Jalen Green at the 3 should be the way forward.
Alperen Sengun. He will grow alongside Jalen Green provided the FO don't fuck it up.
Is it weird that just the other day I randomly pictured jalen green with cornrows and out of nowhere he got them THIS game???!!  Am I bugging??? Like wtf
John Collins and Jalen Green
Jalen Green needs to get selfish  Wood and Gordon have serious tunnel vision
The Rockets literally froze Jalen Green out the game wow.....
"We're finding creative ways to throw the ending of games.  On a sidenote, Wood has to be one of the worst passers and lowest IQ players in the league. Dude is also soft and invisible in the second half of games. I hate it.       Jalen Green needs way more touches and shots.       Sengun needs to play a lot more minutes, he's our best player."
" Lol. Jalen Green and Sengun barely got any touches in crunch time   It was the Theis, Tate and Gordon show  Silas is not the guy to develop these young guys"
Playing him 5 minutes the other night was straight up criminal. This dude has every ounce of potential that Jalen Green does in my opinion
"Jalen Green is much better when he attacks the basket and doesnt settle for off dribble jumpers. He needs to work on his shot, the mechanics are wonky and inconsistent."
This is going to be unpopular but I enjoy watching Jalen Green play
"someone on the Rockets is bound to have a career game against us lmao, don't count yourselves out yet    If you wondering who went off on us during our losses, it was OG/GTJ against Toronto, Terrence Ross on fire TWICE against Orlando as basically Curry-lite, Myles Turner having a career night from 3 with the Pacers, Rubio scoring a career high 37 points on us on 8/9 shooting from 3 and Mobley scoring a career high 26 points, &amp; Pat Connaughton with a near career high of 23 points  Imma bet either Jalen Green or Sengun (if he gets a lot of minutes) will go off on us especially with KPJ out"
I meant that bozo Jalen Green
wonder how mad the rockets are that they picked jalen green over mobley
Can’t wait to see the bulls in the playoffs. Hopefully Jalen Green can imitate Zach’s game.
Idk why but I really dislike KPJ and Jalen Green   I think it might be because they talk so much shit despite being so inefficient and on such a awful team
"[Boston had a great game the other day](https://youtu.be/dsKCZ5hVrxw). He was a top 5 recruit in a class with Cade, Jalen Green, and Mobley. He just had a disastrous season at Kentucky last year (as did mostly everyone)."
"But they're not trying to win, who cares about to's in rookies on a tanking team. Jalen green is averaging 3 turnovers in 32 minutes that's basically the same as Sengun per 36, Cade is 3.3 in 30 minutes and so on"
"Hmmmm i dont think so, but Cade might have fallen to 3/4 with Jalen Green going number 1.  Teams also didnt know how to evaluate G-League for the guys not dominating, everyone knew Green was good but since there's no history of guys going G-League to NBA it was kinda a crapshoot, led to Kuminga falling when he probably shouldn't have."
and Jalen Green took that personally.
"wrong. ""best player"" doesn't mean first option scoring wise. wood is definately better than jalen green right now. probably tate and theis as well currently"
"I think it's pretty much already reversed. Oladipo made an all star game, as has D'Angelo Russell, and Brandon Ingram. Lonzo Ball is clearly not a bust, and if he keeps improving the way he has, all star games aren't out of the question. Bagley has been shit, but hes been the first truly bad, already out of the rotation player in a few years. Morant looks great, Wiseman hasn't played nearly enough to be judged, and even Jalen Green has shown flashes of great potential.    This is assuming the curse was due to the shit run after KD (Beasley, Thabeet, Evan Turner, Derrick Williams, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, etc)."
"Blake Griffin dunks and the nonexistent Jalen Green rivalry with Cade.  Blake’s like a 4th/5th option now after sacrificing his knees for us.  Then Cade hasnt cared about Green at all. And they only face one another twice a season, hard for me to be invested in that"
Jalen green
"Would you say they’ve turned themselves around from post-lebron Cavs? Coz Jalen Green didn’t make Rockets a spectacle and neither did Cade make the Pistons, so did Mobley as a third pick already make a significant difference? Sorry, didn’t watch Cavs so idk but I guess I might be missing out."
Rockets: Jalen Green  Magic: Terrance Ross  To fill in those blanks
Rockets: Jalen green magic: rj hampton
"I mean, he's first in RAPTOR! You know, the stat that rates Jalen Brunson higher than Kevin Durant offensively, and Buddy Hield higher than Draymond Green defensively.  Advanced stats are great, but are only as good as the formulas behind them. Jokic is a great player, Top 5 right now with room to keep getting better, but the advanced stats  thing MIGHT be overplayed a bit right now."
Lavine is a guard. I would say Jalen Green is the quickest guard.
"Pg. Deaaron fox, ja morant,  Russell westbrook.   Sg. Jalen green,  Zach lavine , anfernee simmons, Anthony edwards   Sf. Lebron James, Paul George, miles bridges, Jayson Tatum   Pf. Giannas antekounmpo. Aaron Gordon. John Collins. Pascal siakam  C. Karl Anthony towns. Jarret Allen.  DeAndre ayton"
Jalen Green can shut his mouth now
"There’s the end to end speed and there’s explosive first step of quick burst of speed I’m not gonna dive deep into who has what too much but   PG: it used to be Rose, Westbrook and Wall. Now its def Morant at the fastest guy, Dearon Fox even if he looks slower this year, Shroder, Ish Smith  SG: Lavine and Jalen Green, Anthony Edward built different  SF: I guess it’s still LeBron, Kuminga kinda looks like he has that quick burst too although we haven’t seen too much of that yet. Josh Jackson was projected to be that type of athlete and elite slasher but he never seems to put it together.  PF: Giannis and his long limb and long strides are just ridiculous  Zion quick burst of first step, he’s not the fastest over the full court length but within like 2-3 of space he can move lightning quick   Pascal Siakam is fluidly fast as well in open court, Draymond has pretty good speed leading fast break and quick burst on his short roll  C: AD, Embiid, Bam.. although AD and Embiid are unicorns just fluidly smooth and fast at their size and weights."
"Rockets are going to have to get rid of KPJ. Either that or KPJ is gonna have to be the #2 and do off the ball movement.   I think it's pretty obvious that Jalen has a better knack for running the offense than KPJ. Green has to work on his handles though, and gain some weight."
"PG: Trae, Ja, Fox*, Schroeder   SG: Sexton, Mitchell, Jalen Green  SF: Lavine, Jaylen Brown, Ant Edwards  PF: Zion, Giannis, Jerami Grant   C: KAT, Bam, Turner   *idk if Fox is still as fast, after he bulked up he looks a lot slower"
Cade’s second in rookies in drives per game. He gets by his man more often than Jalen Green… explain how he’s struggling bro. You ain’t say shit w proof.
"Jalen Green went from overrated to underrated in like two weeks.  He's simply asked to do too much for what's supposed to be a professional basketball team. The Rockets have no leadership, no real vets, and he has no one to learn how to win from. He's too green (no pun intended) to be given the keys to a team already and his role means he's gonna be exposed to lots of turnovers/bad shots/etc"

is it just me or did the players all seems bigger and more jacked back then...I'm watching robinson and Rodman then I look over and I see Jalen Green and Tyler Herro skinny ass. I know they're younger tho but Robinson makes AD look like a baby. Just imagine most of the players on the court are Embiid sized
they’re just mad we got jalen green and they gave away every good player they’ve ever had
"This team is ass with no offensive scheme. Their best defensive player is a man from Rocket's Harden era who suffered a bunch of injuries. Christian Wood is arguably the only player on this team that can actually start on a real team. Jalen Green, KPJ, Sengun are couple years off from being starter level players. Kenyon Martin Jr is literally their best prospect at this moment, but coaching staff is dumb enough to only give him 15 minutes."
Except the only “young guys” he plays are Jalen Green and KPJ.  He barely plays any other young guy heavy minutes.
His put back over Jalen Green was NASTYYY!!!!
thought it was a shot at jalen green tbh
I’ll trade jalen green for Luka doncic
First game where Jalen Green consistently showed his speed. He was beating guys and getting to the rim at will  Starting Theis was a disaster. Glad coaching staff has fixed the spacing. Silas still needs to go tho
KPJ out=Jalen Green playing good
Jalen green becomes a non factor so easily
He’s had multiple good games lol. In his 3rd NBA game ever Jalen Green dropped 30 and broke the NBA record for 3PT made by a rookie (8!!! 3PT)  People are sleeping on him because Houston sucks this year but put him with a solid team around him and he will look like the #1 draft pick.
Tbh I haven’t caught a jalen green game so I wanted to check him out. Looks good tonight!
Doubt ur gonna get jalen green or Evan mobley. They are prob taken.
Dude I wish Celtics could get Jalen Green
"Ayee, Let’s go Pistons   Can’t wait to draft Jalen Green"
Another green Jalen to add to the collection
Rockets will take Jalen Green mark my words.
"I really don't get why he's being compared to Luka, Luka's been playing professional basketball since he was 16. And against grown men rather than college kids. Honestly think Cade will be a solid player, but the expectations might not do him good mentally. Jalen Green is IMO more NBA ready, playing with Ex-NBA and pros who came from other leagues, on top of having more upside due to being an athletic freak of nature. He will need to fill out his frame though but he'll already be top 5 most athletic in the NBA from the moment he gets drafted."
He isnt the consensus 2nd pick though. Jalen Green is getting mocked to the Rockets nearly as much as him.
How about Jalen Green?
Jalen Green will be the best player in the Draft and we'll all look back and think how the in fuck did a freak athlete with his skill level not get the hype he deserved?
"&gt;Can someone tell me why Even Mobley is the consensus number 2 pick over Jalen Green?  He's not. Hell, The Athletic says even the Pistons are looking at Green."
And jalen green has lavine on crack potential. Only thing is is that green is probably less likely to bust due to how many centers busy every draft.
Jalen Green ceiling is higher
Jalen Green gonna be the next generational scorer. I'm talking 35 PPG ~ 60+% TS
"Cade is probably the safest prospect but i don't think he's the one with the highest ceiling, Jalen Green has superstar potential if he's puts it all together i think."
* I just don’t see the Rockets passing on Jalen Green personally.   * Boughknught is the kind of athletic guard Sam Presti loves. I see OKC drafting him.   * Duarte is a great pick for the Lakers. He’ll play immediately especially if Caruso is serving time in a Texas prison
"Jalen Green should be considered tbh, i don't see a world where he doesn't end up being a great scorer. He's the next Zach Lavine except coming into the league more polished."
Just a fan Lool   I’m 100% Jalen Green
"Personally, I think Jalen Green.  But I suspect they'll go Evan Mobley who is also a great prospect."
"I really hope we do.  I have nothing against Mobley's talent.  I just worry about his tendency to float in and out of the game.  Jalen Green on the other hand looks like he's on a personal mission to dominate everyone in his path.   If the goal is to draft a star, I'd prefer the guy who seems to have unlimited confidence in himself."
"What indicates Cade being worthy of a top pick? He’s too slow to drive to the basket and his jumper is inefficient and slow. He only looks like a good scorer because of his crazy volume. He’s a great playmaker but it won’t translate as much you would expect because he’ll still be a negative offensively. Even in transition he won’t be great, he’s too slow.  On the other hand Kuminga has all the physical tools to be a good defender and a raw offensive package that needs to develop, but it’s all there: post game, driving, shooting, playmaking. He has all the potential, it’s just a matter of how hard he works. His game isn’t limited like Cunningham’s it’s just raw and undeveloped.   Most teams draft on potential anyways, and Kuminga has the highest ceiling after Jalen Green."
Some say Jalen Green is the best player in the draft.
Jalen Green?
"Possibly, but one of Jalen Green or Evan Mobley will be available, and BPA should be close enough between the 3 to go with fit."
"I know everyone is hype for Cade, but if we can trade back to 2 or 3 and get Jalen Green + some future 1sts or other assets I would be on board. Would have to be a good haul but that doesn't seem like a far fetched scenario"
"Post-lotto mock draft. I'm pretty much going BPA in my opinion, with some subjective considerations, particularly whether I think the team is going for high potential or high floor, and in some cases where multiple players are about the same talent tier, best fit.  1 - Detroit - Cade Cunningham   2 - Houston - Evan Mobley   3 - Cleveland - Jalen Green   4 - Toronto - Jalen Suggs   5 - Orlando - Jon Kuminga   6 - Oklahoma City - Scottie Barnes   7 - Golden State - Moses Moody   8 - Orlando - James Bouknight   9 - Sacramento - Jalen Johnson  10 - New Orleans - Davion Mitchell   11 - Charlotte -  Franz Wagner   12 - San Antonio - Alperen Sengun   13 - Indiana - Josh Giddey   14 - Golden State - Corey Kispert   15 - Washington - Keon Johnson   16 - Oklahoma City - Usman Garuba   17 - Memphis - Ziaire Williams   18 - Oklahoma City - Kai Jones  19 - New York - Cam Thomas  20 - Atlanta - Isaiah Jackson   21 - New York - Sharife Cooper  22 - Los Angeles Lakers - Chris Duarte  23 - Houston - Trey Murphy  24 - Houston - Tre Mann  25 - Los Angeles Clippers - Jaden Springer  26 - Denver - Greg Brown  27 - Brooklyn - Jeremiah Robinson-Earl  28 - Philadelphia - Miles McBride  29 - Phoenix - Day'Ron Sharpe  30 - Ayo Dosunmu"
It’s his job as GM to scout all the players. Pistons weren’t locked into #1 and they shouldn’t of assumed they would be since it’s very unlikely and a small % change got it. They knew they were more likely going to be top 5 and probably were targeting/scouting Jalen Green highly. Things change when you get number 1 though.  All this is just garbage and clickbait. The guy was simply doing his job and assuming you’re not getting the #1 pick is the right thing to prepare for. Cade is their guy
"I called him and told him Jalen Green brought a championship to Detroit and became a HoF player for me in both 2k20 and 2k21, so he is going for Green."
"Cavs will even have Evan mobley or Jalen Greene at #3. Personally I think J. Green has potential to be next Kobe type talent. Shot 37% 3pt w crazy step backs and hes got mad hops and 1st step. ? About Def end and his skinny frame but hes 6 ft 6in 180 lbs. He can put on 20 lbs of muscle over next 2 yrs. Hes only 19 yrs old. Hes still growing. Evan Mobley is best big in class and compared to AD. Hes gonna be a beast. He needs to fill out his body too. Put on muscle. But he can develop a 3 pt shot and better footwork in post. His def is there already.  I believe Hou takes Jalen Green at #2 bc they got Christian Wood who has a similar game.   If that indeed happens. CLE needs to keep that pick and run it to commissioner with no hesitation. Truth is bigs arent coveted as much in this modern NBA. U see mobley being a better Jaren Jackson jr in mem and potential to be like AD in lal.   CLE would then have D Garland, C Sexton, I Okorro, E Mobley, and J Allen. As potential starting 5. Mobley could play the 5 when teams go small. He showed great Def vs smalls in ncaa and closing out on 3 pters.   Evan Mobley at #3 is a steal and I think CLE will stay put if Houston doesn't take Mobley bs they got C wood.  Ppl see upside of Jalen Green as next superstar. When u watch him on tape u see hes best OFF player and mad hops. His hops are Z lavine like and got quick 1st step. The ? Is Defense motor and putting on more muscle.  He shot 37% from 3pt land on hard step back type shots. Guy is a highlight film. Hes got pogo stick hops. Its scary.  Bc hes got step back 3 already and his game is evolving.  He needs to work on passing and facilitating. If Hou picks E mobley #2 , CLE would draft J Green and possibly  look to move sexton. Maybe pkg him w K Love could land CLE a superstar. If CLE just stays put. They could have D GARLAND.. C Sexton.. Jalen Green.. Isaac Okoro.. L Nance Jr.. and J..Allen..   If they cant get Sexton to take less than Max then you trade him this year along w K Love.  Ben Simmons could be in play. Adding K love and C Sexton to Joel embiid could work for both teams.   Playing Ben Simmons at #4 using him as a pick n roller. Rather than ball handling.. simmons can guard 1 - 5 and switch. D GARLAND, J GREEN, I OKORO, B. SIMMONS, J. ALLEN WOULD BE DYNAMITE. WITH L NANCE JR AND CEEDI AND T PRINCE ..   I think CLE is going to have alot of options now...  And staying put and taking whoever falls im their lap may be their best move. Unless they.trade up to go get cade cunninham. If Det aint sold on.#1 or like J green or J suggs or mobley better.. they could trade down..   Look at Fultz and Tatum from a few years ago..   Alot of options CLE is going to have!!   Lucky we lost that coin toss to OKC lol."
"Either would be fine. I would be surprised if Jalen Green becomes available past 3. Nurse and his staff can work on Suggs. He definitely has the tools considering his height, speed, athleticism, and he’s at NBA weight already. I mean Kyle Lowry averaged less than 4 assists in college but he became a solid PG for the Raptors eventually. OG and Siakam were taken beyond the 20th pick and VanVleet was even undrafted. I trust the development team of the Raptors to unlock the potential of a 4th pick player."
"This is the dilemma for me as well.  This whole time I wanted Jalen Green, but now getting the top pick and everyone saying Cade is a sure thing.  Idk.  So much pressure"
I hope its jalen green and  not suggs. Suggs is a combo guard who isnt ideally a 1 with his passing and isnt ideally a 2 as he cant shoot
I think that Jalen Green is the best prospect.  I think he would be a beast in Houston.
Cade is more of a all around player than a pure scorer. Not to say he wont be a good scorer.   Jalen Green is similar to a Anthony Edwards or Zach Lavine. He will be an elite scorer.
i trust weaver to make the right decision because in hindsight he was right about westbrook. if he takes a deal to trade #1 for jalen green and some other sweeteners im gonna trust him until it doesnt pan out
"S&amp;T Oubre + Wiseman + 14th pick for Sexton + Love   Draft Jalen Green, build around Garland/Green/Okoro/Wiseman + 14th pick"
Wiseman + Mobley seems redundant doesn’t it?   I guess they could take Jalen green in that scenario
Wiseman + Mobley seems redundant doesn’t it?   I guess they could take Jalen green in that scenario
Wiseman + Mobley seems redundant doesn’t it?   I guess they could take Jalen green in that scenario
Just pick Mobley for us so we can get KPJ 2.0 in Jalen Green :)
"Jalen Green is 6'6, feasibly he could slot in at wing and they can see if his defense is horrific. If he's average then you can play all three and then plan around them. He's not done growing."
"Jalen Green is 6'6, feasibly he could slot in at wing and they can see if his defense is horrific. If he's average then you can play all three and then plan around them. He's not done growing."
"The Rockets could also take Jalen Green out of potential since it also seems that he’s ready for NBA spacing with what he showed in the G League. The only reason why they won’t consider Mobley is because his game may be conflicting with Woods. I do get your point about Wall. However, not sure who would want that 40+ M per for 3 more years after what they saw this season from him. They’ll most likely go Green before Suggs since you also can’t succeed in the NBA without that solid wing.  After Mark Jackson, there was Starbury though not from the draft. Also, Linsanity. Lol"
From Primo pasta Jalen Green Adobo commercials
"Sam was on a podcast right after the draft and these are the relevant things I found from it:      Some Rockets relevant stuff on here:     -Troy Weaver (DET GM) has been high on Jalen Green all year and is ""a wild card"" and someone ""that doesn't subscribe to groupthink"" when it comes to draft eval &amp; pref     -Evan Mobley isn't a loud vocal leader type     - Both guys have Suggs 2nd https://t.co/zapou59V5m      — Don Knock (@DonKnock) June 23, 2021      (ctd):     -Rockets have to consider Mobley's quieter personality in how they want to construct their locker room, Isaiah Mobley was the vocal leader for the USC team but Evan did try to ""come out of his shell"" more the last few seasons     -Vecinie has Mobley as All-NBA ceiling      — Don Knock (@DonKnock) June 23, 2021      -Vecinie likes Suggs aggressiveness     -Green's athleticism and ability to produce against pros in G League are key and his shooting looks legit as well as half court creation abilities trajectory is most intriguing; needs to add strength     -Pennie has Mobley as more off-the ball guy      — Don Knock (@DonKnock) June 23, 2021"
"Calling it now, they will get Jalen Green at no. 2-3 + an all-star for the 1st pick. Then proceed to win at least 45 games lololol"
"After winning the 2021 [NBA](http://bleacherreport.com/nba) draft lottery on Tuesday night, the [Detroit Pistons](http://bleacherreport.com/detroit-pistons) are open to trading the No. 1 overall pick.   According to [Rod Beard](https://twitter.com/detnewsRodBeard/status/1407679561169506305) of the Detroit News, Pistons general manager Troy Weaver said Wednesday that trading the top pick is ""an option.""  Per [The Athletic](https://theathletic.com/2668326/2021/06/23/nba-mock-draft-2021-picks-for-every-lottery-team-including-jalen-suggs-to-magic-and-evan-mobley-to-cavaliers/)'s James Edwards III, Oklahoma State guard Cade Cunningham is the likely pick for Detroit if it stands pat, although G League Ignite guard [Jalen Green](http://bleacherreport.com/jalen-green) and USC center Evan Mobley are under ""strong consideration"" by the Pistons as well."
"I think only way #1 gets dealt is if the Rockets make the Pistons an offer they can’t refuse. To be honest. The Rockets need Cade and Green fits the Pistons better. But make no mistake, Cade is the clear #1 pick. I love Jalen Green, but he’s waaaay more risky a pick than Cade is."
"Ik people love Cade because he’s literally perfect for the modern NBA, like he’s damn near built for it as a 6’8 wing who can shoot and do it all on offense with the size, speed, and IQ to play in a full switch defense. He’s perfect for the one man engine offenses of today in the Luka/Harden mold. But man Jalen Green is built to score. Put him in a college season 10 years ago and I think he goes number 1 with Kobe/MJ comparisons. Because I think that is his comparison right now. He’s that gifted of a scorer at 19 and has that superstar athleticism. First step and vertical is insane. Cade’s skill set is just more coveted in today’s game and he’s def the safer pick. I would def go Cade number 1 but if everything pans out for Jalen man…I just have a feeling he could be the next Kobe/MJ type SG. Book is really damn close to being that and he’s in the WCF rn but Green just has that extra gear. Could also be completely fucking wrong tho."
Who says they’re taking Mobley they could easily grab Jalen Green with the second pick that’s a no brainer imo
"Jalen Green projects to be a better scorer than Cade, so I get it.  They gotta do their research."
Don't compare Milicic with Green. I'd take Cade as #1 but Jalen Green could easily end up as the best player in the draft
"Wood is not a 4. He’s too slow to guard wings full time and his scoring game would not fit well with another guy inside the arc. KPJ and Wall already like to drive a lot, don’t need to make Mobley and Wood take turns sitting at the 3pt line for extended stretches  Maximize one of them. And sign Olynk as our backup big. Get a big wing to be our 4, it’s how the nba is played now. Two bigs are not gonna work as well as not having two bigs   But I want Jalen Green"
"It's rare to find 6'8"" ball handlers/point guards who shoots 40% from three. It's hard to see him fail in the NBA. He also had terrible teammates in NCAA so it definitely didn't help him look impressive.  I think the gap between him and Jalen Green isn't very big though."
I could see the pistons grabbing Jalen Green and not regretting it tbh.
"That sounds about right to me, I don't think Toronto moves down, the idea of Mobley or Jalen Green on that roster is very exciting. FVV, Green, OG, Siakam and whatever big you can find is very balanced and versatile, the same goes with taking Mobley. Mobley fixes the centre spot for you guys as a long-term solution who can do everything except score in the post, a skill that is not really valuable in the NBA. Cleveland could move down, they already have a young core in place and really don't need anything except maybe another big wing. In my head, Bazley, No.6 and maybe a future pick feels like a fair trade"
"Not a lot of room for an undersized PG on a contending team in the west, especially with Jalen Brunson was a fringe 6MOY candidate.  That being said, wasn't it rumored that Harambob forced you all to draft Josh Green over Saddiq Bey? Oof."
"It's not a good comparison. Cade Cunningham is widely believed to be a lock for #1, but not everyone agrees (Sam Vecenie of the Athletic)  &gt;While Cunningham is by far the most likely pick here, I don’t think we should necessarily write this in stone yet. The one thing that every person in basketball says about Troy Weaver is that he absolutely does not subscribe to group think. He said in a post-lottery presser that they’ll look at five guys and then make the best decision. It’s worth taking him at his word. After the lottery, I got texts from multiple sources that said the Pistons are also thought to be fans of Jalen Green. So look, I’m mocking Cunningham here. Pistons fans who want Cunningham shouldn’t have a meltdown based off this. But this isn’t like 2019 when Zion Williamson was a done deal and everyone in the basketball industry knew it. Cunningham is considered the likely choice here. He’s the overwhelming favorite. But everyone seems to be acting like this is unequivocally a done deal, and I’m not totally convinced of that as of right now, an hour after the lottery.  Most people have Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Evan Mobley at similar levels, with some adding Jonathan Kuminga to that mix. Since yesterday, Rockets fans have generally be in favor of drafting Jalen Green, followed by Evan Mobley, and Jalen Suggs a distant third."
"""With the 3rd pick, The Cleveland Cavaliers select.... Jalen Green, from the G League.""  I'm speaking this into existence."
&gt;inevitably go with Mobley  We have no indication from the FO but Jalen Green seems to be the popular choice among the fanbase.
I'd say they should get at least 1 player from this draft. It's too good of an opportunity. Either trade up for Jalen Green or select someone like Moody. The 14th pick can be used to select a shooter or be used in a trade package.
"Pistons would get roasted hard if they take anyone besides Cade Cunningham from Oklahoma State (compared to Luka &amp; Tatum), although there is Jalen Green (compared to Beal &amp; LaVine) who did a year in the G league instead of college that people are saying could have a higher upside."
I think this is more likely than people think. It was reported tonight Pistons are also considering Jalen Green. Still think they take Cade but I don’t think it’s as set in stone as it seems rn.
Is Jalen Green eligible for our NT tho?  Otherwise I will wait for Kai Sotto
"Jalen green is gonna be nice , still a couple years away even with talent added"
Wait. We could see Jalen Brown vs Jalen Green next year?
"&gt; Because my original point was about building a title contender and what players are capable of beingthe best player... like Kawhi in 2019. You're literally not following the thread of what I've said. Nobody said those dudes suck or that will better health yall aren't a playoff team. Are you saying losing in the second round is noteworthy? The Sixers will be ecstatic to find that out.  I followed the thread of what you are saying, I disagree with trading Siakam so you can roll the dice and maybe get a player as good as him in the future especially when any picks we get in return for him will most likely be late lottery or protected firsts. It isn't something we've done with our current front office regime and it was a success in the end. And if we trade Siakam for what would amount of some meh first-rounders might as well trade everyone not named OG, Flynn and Green as well and just go into an extended rebuild rather than attempting a retool. It also isn't that likely that we'd get a player better than Siakam with any mid to late first-rounders we'd get from trading him.  Losing in Game 7 of the second round after your All-Star + All-NBA player goes into a terrible uncharacteristic slump after not touching a ball during lockdown in Toronto in a Disney World bubble during a pandemic is the tiniest bit different than the Sixers losing in game 7 of the second round after Embiid gets injured again and Ben Simmons does a playoff Ben Simmons thing.  &gt; are you trying to win a title or just not be in the lottery because that core is not the former and you know it. And that's before getting into the fact you're going to have to pay some of them in the next few years. And that's before getting into the fact you're going to have to pay some of them in the next few years.  A core with playable centres that had the 2nd best record in the league last year. That's beyond just ""not be in the lottery"". Re-tooling by looking to rectify a weakness that killed us this year (no centres), putting whichever Jalen we draft through the famed Raptors development program and continuing to develop our young guys on top of a core that outside of a pandemic and Disney World bubble was an elite team &gt;&gt;&gt; blowing it up cause apparently 27 is too old.  Who would we have to pay in the next few years? Siakam and FVV are locked in until 2023-24, OG until 2024-25, Flynn's two year team option has him locked in until 2023-24. The players that we have to pay now or soon are Lowry who is a UFA, Boucher who has one more year under contract, Gary Trent Jr who is an RFA, Jalen Harris who is coming off his two-way contract now and if we want to resign them Khem Birch and Stanimal. Based on our current contracts and cap holds, we have the 4th highest practical cap space after OKC, Spurs and Knicks so having to pay some of our players who are really just Trent Jr, Harris, Boucher and Lowry isn't a concern."
"For Cade, there is not any number of draft picks that would get a deal done. Why would the pistons trade their first no. 1 pick since 1970 for future picks? Especially when there is a consensus #1 prospect that every team was dying to get unless they were to get an extremely talented prospect like SGA in return... I could see a world where Weaver prefers Jalen Green and trades down to #2 to pick him instead similar to the deal that got the Celtics Tatum but the Thunder only have pick 6."
"Excerpt from the athletic:  &gt;While Cunningham is by far the most likely pick here, I don’t think we should necessarily write this in stone yet.

"Sure, but if Toronto has, say, Jalen Green, would they be willing to sign GTJ to a sizable contract to be behind FVV and Green for the foreseeable future at the 2 and behind OG at the 3?"
The gang selects Jalen Green
if jalen green falls to them then yes
"Mobley is far from a traditional center like those guys. He’s not paint dominant. He was like 10th percentile at post scoring last year.   He’s a face-up, agile, rangy big man. His game screams 4 at the NBA level. He would co-exist very well with either Wood or Allen.   I think there’s a good chance he makes it post Rockets if they really like Green. But it’s really hard to see Mobley slip past the Cavs.   Green is 6’5 and projects as a SG and Suggs is 6’4 and is a combo guard. Sexton and Garland are like the two building blocks in Cleveland so far. It doesn’t make sense for them to go with a Jalen. Mobley makes a lot more sense for them."
jalen green is better than cade
It would be cool to see them parlay some of those picks to move up a bit. Maybe with the Cavs to get Jalen Green
"Come on, you already have a Jalen Green -- his name is Kevin Porter Jr."
Jalen Green all the way
"A young core of KPJ, Jalen Green/Suggs and Mobley would be phenomenal"
We would trade 7 + 14 to take Jalen green. Shit I’m pretty sure we’d do wiseman and 14 for #3
Let’s go ROCKETS  JALEN GREEN ON THE WAY
We might get Jalen Green.
Jalen Green&gt;Cade Cunningham
You think Houston will take Mobley? I think they’re more likely to go Jalen Green.
Jalen Green is going to be a beast!
"I gotta be honest a Ben for Sexton trade makes a lot of sense to me.  At first I’d say no way because of the scoring you’re losing giving up Sexton, but if you bring in Ben and now Jalen Green to me that more than makes up for it and makes you more viable on defense.  And for the Sixers, come on Sexton is everything Ben’s not. You go from a 6’10 gifted athlete who seems largely apathetic at times… to a 6’1 bulldog who gives it his everything at all times and can forcibly score the basketball.   Philly would fall in love with Sexton probably 5 minutes into his first game"
"Knicks were projected #1 to get Zion but we feel to #3 and more than thrilled with RJ Barrett.  Now Kuminga who's likely at #5 isn't really a consolation here but who knows?  Maybe Cavs psych themselves out of 3 because it'll be between guards Jalen Green and Suggs, and trade down to round out their roster.  Who knows?"
PLEASE LET JALEN GREEN FALL TO 4
That’s very true.  I forgot that GM’s can lie about that  Jalen Green is that guy
Jalen green-issac-fultz would have been nice 😔
"Garland grew hes about 6’3, I’d try to trade Sexton for  a lottery pick for a team who needs a scoring guard and take a jalen or trade allens rights and draft Mobley (assuming my rockets take green)"
damn I thought Okoro was taller lol. Either way… I love the talent on this team assuming they take Jalen Green who is personally my favorite prospect in the draft
You mean Jalen Green
Jalen Green
I would just take Jalen Green. They aren’t one player away from being a contender.
hes gonna take time and mentor Jalen Green or Suggs
The Raps are hoping Jalen Green is there at 4.
Houston better take Jalen Green
 hope  the raps get jalen green or suggs those boys are box office
"If the Raps end up with Jalen Green, that might end up being a dream come true for them. Such a good roster fit with an insane upside"
Man I'd be looking to take Jalen Green if I was Houston.. gonna be an exciting scorer . Plus they already have Christian Wood an All-Star potential big and he's only 25
I’m guessing it’ll be 1. Cade 2. Jalen Suggs 3. Evan Mobley 4. Jalen Green. Maybe flip the Jalens
"Be patient. In the long run the NCAA has no chance for high-level NBA prospects. There exists a possibility of 2 of the top 4 players drafted in the NBA will be from the G-League this year. This will open the path for new prospects. The #2 HS prospect Jaden Hardy signed for a G-League team.   Now, if you are a five star prospect and your choices are Duke and the G-League it will be increasingly harder to turn down the G-League offer. Jalen Green earned 250k + benefits this year. This is peanuts compared to his potential NBA earnings. Why waste your time taking first year undergrad courses you will never need? He developed under an NBA system and coaching.   The infrastructure isn't there to accommodate all the top players from HS right now. But with time I can see the G-League absorb all the top level  sure-fire NBA prospects. The future Zion or Lebron will have opportunities that their predecessor never had.   It will start with a generational talent. Then others will follow. Then fans will watch their games. Then their TV contracts expand. Then the players get a bigger piece of that pie. Then 500k can easily become multi-million dollar contracts."

Holiday- Cade Cunningham   Booker- Jalen Suggs   Middleton- Jalen Green  Give some young players a shot. USA is getting gold anyways
Jalen green was the #1 prospect who bet on himself and went the g league route playing against closer to nba level competition for a year and is still young. Mobley may be a great player but I want the guy with more edge and bravado. Mobley seems a bit more low-key which is fine but as a rebuilding team we need a presence and identity. It's the draft so we won't know for sure for a couple seasons but I think green has a higher ceiling and can help give us a post harden identity
"Tier one is absolutely bonkers but after that these are some creative ideas. I’m not sure how Jalen Green falls to the warriors at 7 though, you’d probably have to be anticipating more of a Keon Johnson around there"
Thanks. Jalen green is going to be an exciting player unlike that bum wiseman
"They could tell Jalen Green that, though."
notice the piston fan doing damage control as if someone raving over Jalen Green subtracts from Cade... talk about insecure
jalen green absolutely does not have more potential than mobley. there’s not an argument to be made in behalf of it lol.
"The draft is a 4-5 player class with the best prospects being Cade, Jalen Green, Evan Mobley, Jalen Suggs, and Jonathan Kuminga/Scottie Barnes.  I believe Cade is 1A, and Jalen Green is 1B. This draft has a lot of wings + premier role players in the back end of the draft, and surplus of vertastile bigs. But if you watch Beal/Lavine/Brandon Roy, you can see a lot of similarities in his game. Super advanced scoring feel, his athleticism also takes him over the top, dude just glides when he finishes.  The dude scoring is just effortless, and he averaged 17.9 PPG against grown professional G-League players at 19.      [The man is just money, look at him.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8YWVkr8D6w&amp;ab_channel=CPH2K)"
Is jalen green good I have no idea who he is. Don’t care about the draft anymore
"I think you guys just are parroting this stuff, man.  It’s okay to have an undersized Sexton with an undersized Garland and give it a shot.  It doesn’t mean we can’t draft Jalen Green.  3 good young guards is ok.  We can’t just trade Sexton unless there’s a really good trade for it - a really good trade for a guy who gets about 25 ppg on really good efficiency and is only 22.  A guy who has shown consistent development each year.  Where were at right now is one of the worst teams in the league.  If we get to the point where we’re like Philly and Portland and people are saying “these guys are in the playoffs but I’m not sure they can win together” then we’ll talk!  I would LOVE to be there.  We’re not even close yet though so let’s keep the good things we have!"
I’m interpreting this as OP saying rockets should draft Jalen green instead of Evan Mobley   u/bernardjordan
"On Kai, indeed his two-year hiatus from organized competition didn't help him but his NBL stint will rectify that. Hope he's not on the receiving end of any residual resentment from the Aussie brawl.  I see him making the NBA if only because 7'3 non-stiffs don't grow on trees. If he grows to what is said to be his projected height of 7'6 (!) he will be a more intriguing prospect. Next Yao Ming or next Shawn Bradley? He needs to get stronger so he won't get dunked on by NBA players the way Jalen Green and AP Manlapaz did.  To the next generation of Philippine basketball players, please, please, go overseas. You'll develop skills you won't develop in the iso-heavy PBA while earning significantly more in the process."
"Jalen Green, Kuminga, Emoni bates decommitted to potentially go pro, LaMelo, Daishen Nix, RJ Hampton, Anfernee Simons, Darius Bazley"
Jalen Green and Jonathan Kuminga off the top of my head.
Depends really on how Mobley develops. I think they should go Jalen Green though
"Off topic, but its getting so hard for me to keep track of these younger players and prospects who have similar names. There are so many guys in recent drafts or in the upcoming drafts (especially some of the higher rated prospects) that have names like Jalen, Jaylen, Jaden, Jaren etc that I keep mixing them up. In this case there literally was a guy named Jalen McDaniels the year before Jaden McDaniels which is what caused me to go down this rabbit hole   2018: Jaren Jackson Jr, Jalen Brunson  2019: Jaylen Norwell, Jaylen Hands, Jalen McDaniels  2020: Jalen Smith, Jaden McDaniels, Jalen Harris,  2021: Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Johnson, Jaden Springer, Jared Butler  2022: Jaden Hardy, Jaden Ivey  2023-24: Jalen Duran, Jalen Washington, Jaden Bradley, Jalen Lewis, Jaylen Clark, Jayden Nicholson  Thank you for listening to my Ted Talk"
hope to see clarkson and jalen green play for the team next time
Probably has a lot to do with Jalen Green or Jalen Suggs.
"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
Jalen Green. Wings &gt; Bigs in today’s NBA
Jalen Green
Jalen Green is gonna be a highlight machine. There is a good chance he can win roty over Cade.
Jalen or Cade.  Whichever one the pistons don’t pick.   Jalen Green lol forgot there were 2 Jalens
Jalen Green. If you have a blank slate you pick for talent. Plus Houston does have a Filipino community and knows how to market an Asian superstar.
Jalen Green
"Can't go wrong with either, in my opinion (Jalen Green or Evan Mobley). I personally lean towards Mobley."
Jalen Green
Yeah I like Cade a lot but if it means giving up our unprotected 2022 first or the 2026 unprotected BKN pick just to move up one spot then I'm perfectly fine with taking Jalen Green instead. He'd easily go number 1 in plenty of other drafts.
Jalen Green is a baller    Def better than Suggs will ever be
"If the package is good and they think Jalen Green isn't a big step down from Cunningham, it's possible. See 'Fultz and Tatum swap'.  Good on Cunningham too, since he's from Texas. Tho he seems more like a Mavs fan than a Rocket."
"Cause the Piston wants Jalen Green apparently, but will take cade at number 1 either way."
Jalen Green and multiple first sounds better than Cade but both are amazing positions to be in.
"On the other hand if there’s a godfather offer (like 2, multiple future first including their own, Tate, etc.) out there for 1 that they don’t take and Cade ends up a bust/isn’t even an all star while jalen green or Mobley become amazing, then weaver gets shit on and put on a short leash.   Or if he does do it and it ends up like that, then he gets super big praise and a long leash like someone like Danny ainge had for a long time."
WITH THE NUMBER ONE PICK THE HOUSTON ROCKETS SELECT JALEN GREEN
jalen green is more like the next mj offensively
Cade and Jalen Green are both gonna be amazing. Why waste a bunch of assets to go from Green to Cunningham?
"What players do the Rockets have that the Pistons even want? We already had Wood and we saw how that ended, KPJ we drafted and traded away on draft night, and he doesn't fit the high-character mold Weaver and Casey follow, plus he'd be redundant if we select Jalen Green in this trade down scenario, and Tate will be a 26 year old second year player when the season starts and is redundant with Saddiq Bey."
Jrue Holiday  Zach Lavine (Jalen Green in the future that dude is cute as fuck)  Matisse Thybulle  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Serge Ibaka  Best defense in the league.. I'll take Kyrie off the bench for some insta offense he p cute
Someone named Jalen Green.     That man's agent deserves 50% of his contract. This time last year he was 4/5 with Kuminga.
"Yup didn't see Weaver and Coach Casey take Jalen Green or any other top prospects to the Tigers game after they held his workout, thats honestly pretty telling that they were just doing their due diligence and maybe also getting an early scouting report for their first matchup against these other top prospects."
on the otherhand jalen green played in the g league with nba rules and was fantastic
Jalen green is good enough bruh
Jalen Green shot 37% from 3 and 83% at the FT line from the NBA three point line.  He’s more proven than a lot of these guys
Where did Jalen Green get maturity concerns from? You’re the first person to mention this
"Jalen Green shot 37% from the NBA 3pt line, he is already a more proven shooting commodity than any college player"
"Jalen Green will be the best scorer in year two or three if he figures eveything out, his body is so fluid like Kobe or KD, thats the sign of a really good scorer"
"Yeah there is, and Jalen Green will be a great player without a doubt.   But my second point still stands, and as you said as well, Jalen green will have to take on a smaller role due to many other mouths to feed(like you said, john wall, kpj, wood, kenyon martin jr even)  Hell, 24ppg as a rookie is the highest since Allen Iverson in 1997! Obviously Green is a great player, but circumstances combined with NBA difficulty make me think that 24ppg is highly unlikely for him."
"there def is a chance.   houston is likely taking jalen green  if cavs trade sexton, they can either roll with suggs/garland/allen, or draft mobley and have to move allen down the line. theres a chance they might prefer suggs in that scenario"
"Yeah but KPJ had a 50 point, 11 assist game just a few weeks after coming from the g league. He did have a smaller role on the Rockets than he had in the g league so obviously his stats took a hit. He was playing with Wall and others  Kenyon Martin JR who averaged 18/11/3 in the G league averaged 19/8/4 (9 games) as a starter in the NBA  Keep in mind that also those guys were 20 at the time. Jalen Green just turned 19 this year lol  Not saying Green is the next MJ or anything but there’s evidence of some translation"
"MVP: Tatum, MIP: Mikal Bridges, ROTY: Jalen Green, COTY: Ty Lue, 6MOTY: Brunson, NBA Champ: Nets in 6 verses Suns"
"Going bold  **Jayson Tatum** \- Best 2-way player in the NBA  **Luka Doncic** \- In the middle of his prime, probably doing historical things  **Zion Williamson** \- One of the most dominant drivers to the rim ever, hes gonna be a monster scorer in his prime  **Giannis Antetokounmpo** \- In the Latter half of his prime, but still doing Giannis things  **Trae Young** \- Arguably the best Scorer in the NBA  **Anthony Edwards** \- He will be having crazy scoring seasons and his frame makes him a scary slasher at the rim  **Paolo Banchero** \- Bold take, I think its the #1 pick in 2022 Draft, he will be a dominant 2-way player like AD  **Cade Cunningham** \- 2-Way Superstar, best playmaker in the league   **Donovan Mitchell** \- In the midst of his prime, I think he shifts into taking less drives and shooting more.  **Jalen Green** \- Explosive Young PG like athlete, he develops into a 2-Way Superstar as well  &amp;#x200B;  HM: Ja Morant, Devin Booker, Emoni Bates, Jaden Hardy, Lamelo Ball"
"I'm high on Jalen Green and 24ppg is possible but extremely unlikely.  G league stats are inflated a lot as OP said in his reply. For example, KPJ averaged 24/7 in the g league but 16/6 in the NBA. G league defense is leagues behind NBA, so it's a stretch to call them actual NBA guys.   Also, Rockets have a lot of high volume shooters like KPJ, Christian Wood, John Wall(assuming he doesn't get traded), hell even jsean Tate is gonna put up lots of attempts. I don't think he's gonna be the 1st option and even if he is 24ppg is a big stretch"
"Yeah but a lot of guys put up high scoring numbers in the g league, Sekou Doumbouya's g league stats are very similar to Jalen Green's, and Doumbouya averaged 5 ppg. Obviously Green is better than Sekou, but 24 just doesnt seem likely, at least not on great effiency."
If jalen green averaging that then shit keon johson for the wizards gonna put up  43ppg  19rpg  17apg  12bpg  9spg  95%fg  92%from 3  99.99998%ft
"Cade:  15 Points, 6 Rebounds, 6 Assists 43/35/76 shooting splits  Jalen Green:  24 Points, 5 Rebounds, 4 Assists 46/38/82 shooting splits  Mobley:  10 Points, 8 Rebounds, 1 Block 56/20/68 shooting splits  Suggs:  20 Points, 4 Rebounds, 6 Assists 40/30/78 shooting splits"
This is me when people compare jalen green to Zach Lavine.   I’m like “Nah I want YOU” towards Kobe comparisons
Now imagine if they pick Jalen Green
"Yeah we have the 4th pick incoming, if it's Jalen Suggs or somehow Green falls to us, having Schroeder is literally worse than nothing. He'll be eating into minutes we could be spending developing our potentially go-to guy. Only reason we maybe want Schroeder is if we draft Mobley, which looks like probably isn't going to happen.  I would rather top out at a 5-6th seed with valuable playoff experience for the 4th pick and GTJ/Boucher than sign Schroeder on a 2 year deal."
"3, I'd only take Cade and Jalen Green over him"
"I'd also take Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, and Evan Mobley over Gobert"
Jalen Green  Now give Brandon his ring
Jalen Green
Of course he won't wake up one day with Kobe's body. He'll always be Jalen Green you can't limit his ceiling
Jalen Green gonna end up being the best
"I get that we’re talking ceilings so it doesn’t really matter, but Jalen Green will never be Kobe Bryant"
"Jalen Green will be impacting his team quick, and if uninjured, will go on to become one of the best wing players in his prime."

Jalen Green and Evan Mobley will both be better NBA players than Cade when it's all said and done
All this scottie barnes hype... Hes basically the second coming of MKG. Jalen Green will be the next T Mac
Jalen Green will win ROY by scoring a ton of garbage buckets for the Rockets.
Jalen Green has enormous bust potential
Jalen Suggs?  More like Jalen Sucks  Green and Mobley will be the top 2 players in the draft
Jalen green is the best player out of this draft. That simple!
"Cade Cunningham will be a role player.  Evan Mobley will be the best player in the draft, with Jalen Green a close second.  Kuminga, Wagner, and Keon Johnson will bust hard."
"there’s an overlap issue, a roster construction issue in Cleveland with the guards. but this just feels like a mistake they HAVE to make because they made a series of other mistakes.  If they took Halliburton like many wanted, they could pair Halliburton and Sexton. Halliburton to take more of the PG responsibilities and guard the bigger guards. Sexton to create shots and get buckets. Then trade Garland. People aren’t gonna fault them for drafting Garland with Sexton on the roster because he was the best player available and the draft was week.  Instead they draft Okoro who is forced to play the 3 - but is more of a 2 - because SexLand exists. So they’re small 1-3 as is. Tiny really.  they end up trading the best player on the roster because he’s about to get expensive and no longer fits.  Just awful awful roster construction.  Lastly, if they draft Jalen Green and trade Sexton the mess doesn’t improve. There’s a chance Green is never as efficient a scorer as Sexton. Maybe a better defender. Maybe."

Is there any reasonable chance that Houston doesn't pick Jalen Green
"I definitely don’t view everyone as can’t miss.   I think the top 4 all have huge potential, but realistically they all have faults to their game. Cunningham is lacking elite athleticism (although I think he is the safest pick), Green can score but he is still missing other parts of his game to be a more complete player, Mobley is a bit of a project where he needs to improve in multiple facets of the game, Suggs is a Jack of all trades master of none point guard with great athleticism but mediocre shooting.   Realistically I think they all will be good, but I could see someone like Mobley being a bust, or Green not being as impactful in the NBA.  I just think Suggs is closer to Jalen Green than he is to Kuminga where there are way more question marks, even if Suggs is basically the consensus 4th pick."
MVP: Luka because I'm biased  ROTY: Jalen Green  DPOY: Giannis Antetokounmpo  6MOY: Danilo Gallinari  MIP: Darius Garland  COY: Rick Carlisle
Don't forget upcoming top 5 pick Jalen Green
jalen green kobe
"Because they’ve got two undersized guards who can’t defend which isn’t a winning recipe (See: Blazers and that’s with Dame being far better than Sexton will probably ever be).  So using this logic you’ve probably gotta pick one of Sexton and Garland. Garland is younger, has an extra year of the rookie deal, a better playmaker, and some argue has more upside.  So especially if Jalen Green falls to them at 3, the argument is that taking green gets them some size and defense at the guard spot while maintaining the scoring ability (if Green pans out of course) and they can trade Sexton for assets to round out their team, because he would most certainly have a sizable market.  There are also some rumors that he didn’t get along with some teammates and his coaches treatment of him upset some teammates. Not too versed on these rumors and their validity though so take this part with a grain of salt"
"Cade cunningham was 8 when the decision happened, born 8/25/01. Jalen Green was 8 when the decision happened, born 2/9/02. Jalen Suggs turned 9 a month before the decision happened, born 6/3/01. That’s just the top three prospects, I can keep going if you’d like?"
"If they wind up with Jalen Green, that’s 3 pretty ball dominant players. Makes more sense to trade him for a wing before they have to give him a max"
"Jalen Green ROTY, Davis MVP, Lakers champs"
"They’re taking Jalen Green, duh"
I'll only worry if they take Jalen Green to a Tigers game too.
I hope Jalen Green has as much of an impact if not more as Ayton…

Where were you when Jalen Green saved the Houston Rockets and the NBA?
KPJ and Jalen Green backcourt is gonna be tough in a few years
"What if, when they did their player comparisons, they would show the NBA player when that guy was coming out of the draft? For example, Jalen Green was compared to Zach Lavine. Personally, I would think it would be cool if, instead of the Zach Lavine we see now putting up 26 a game, we saw clips of Lavine when he was at UCLA. Thoughts?"
"At 6’6 Green meets the size threshold for a potential #1 on a championship team although he will need to put on some weight as his career progresses. His elite athletic traits combined with his high level instincts in transition make him a walking Sportscenter highlight, and I’d bet it won’t take long into Summer League for a Jalen Green highlight to pop up on your phone. An offense that is going to encourage him to push the pace in transition and early offense would mesh well with Green’s skillset. His high level athleticism translated into elite finishing ability at the rim against G League competition, which is notably stronger than the competition at the college level. Green has a DEEP bag, he uses a variety of moves off the dribble to create driving lanes and a living rooms worth of space for the jumper. The step-back jumper is a staple amongst elite wing scorers in the league today and Jalen Green walks into the league with it tucked away in his bag. Green isn’t one dimensional though, he can get points without dominating the ball with good cutting instincts.    Defense may not have been one of the highlights of his game but anyone as athletic as he is potential to be a good defender with strong effort. I would love to see Green land on a team that has a primary ball handler; he should be eased into a larger workload instead of having it thrust on him from day 1.    Jalen Green choosing to spend a year playing with the pros in the G League tells me that he’s taking his pro career seriously and that can’t go unnoticed. Not only did he take the challenge of going to the G League, he excelled. He went relatively unnoticed during this past season because of where he was playing and he only popped into my radar while listening to Chris Vernon a few months ago. With the right coaching and situation I believe Jalen Green could end up being the best player in the 2021 NBA draft.   &amp;#x200B;  More prospects to watch here: https://www.picknscroll.com/2021/07/2021-nba-draft-3-prospects-to-watch.html"

"&gt; Excluding Cade Cunningham and Evan Mobley (everyone is keeping a close eye on them)  Lol how are you gonna say this and then talk about Jalen Green like he's not in that category.  To answer your question though--for me as a Michigan fan,  it's Franz Wagner. Apparently he's grown to 6'10""/6'11"" since the season ended. Top tier defender and can do it all on offense. Outplayed Scottie Barnes start to finish in the NCAA tourney."
[Jalen Green rinow](https://youtu.be/B9MNITrHu9E?t=121)
"Lol very fun, Jalen Green seems like a cool af dude."
Star: Jalen Green   Bust: Sengun  Steal: Trey Murphy III
"and with the 59th pick, Brooklyn selects Jalen Green"
I just fell in love with Jalen Green.  He seemed like such a fun kid.
Jalen Green easily.
It's pretty crazy that Jalen Green has been getting in workouts with both Steph Curry and Luka since he was a junior in high school.   I think his game translates and grows really well on the next level.
Boi we getting Jalen Green tonight
1. Jalen Green  2. Cade Cunningham  3. Franz Wagner  4. Evan Mobley  5. Davion Mitchell  6. Alperen Sengun  7. Jalen Suggs  8. Jared Butler  9. Sharife Cooper  10. Moses Moody
"Orlando fan here hoping we end up with something like this:  Barnes/Bouknight  Barnes/Sengun  Suggs/Bouknight  Suggs/Sengun  Suggs/Kuminga  and trading #5 and #8 up for Mobley  I also think there’s a chance Jalen Green slips tonight, not sure to which team"
I feel like Jalen Green vs Anthony Edwards is a much better question to ask
Rockets are in a much better position right now than where they would be if they had Ben Simmons locked into the max for 4 years.  Having Jalen Green and a clean slate + Nets future picks is better than having Simmons
Jalen Green
Someone should make the Spider-Man pointing meme with Jalen Green / KPJ / Harden. This Rocket team is legit about to be so much fun with that dynamic backcourt + Wood among other studs on the team
Jalen Green
jalen green
Who cares  Jalen Green a BUCKET
Jalen Green is going to be must watch basketball.
Us Jalen Green stans are fucking HYPED UP right now.  The man is a basketball demigod
Jalen Green is the next Messi
This game is going to end in a Jalen Green dagger or game winner. I'm speaking it into existence.
im all in on jalen green lmao.  this dude is gonna be a monster out the gate.
Wow jalen green and Kevin Porter how cool. Fuck I’d gladly trade all the Nuggets if it meant I could get a rookie and a worse Porter jr.   “jokic will want out soon leaving you in poverty”  I mean do I even have to say it? Talking about this as a rockets fan?  And talking about jamals contract when you have the worst contract in the league on your roster
I don't think jalen green has questionable character right ?
"News flash we just drafted jalen green and easily won the draft. And have KPJ. You’re stuck with jamall murray on a super max lol, jokic will want out soon leaving you in poverty"
As I said he's a good player  Jalen Green is a different level entirely--the kind of player that can change the trajectory of a franchise (and that's not 16.6 PPG on 52% TS)
Jalen Green gonna be a star everyone who's followed him since high school ain't gonna be surprised
  Jalen Green is a better shooter but KPJ got him everywhere else   Let’s calm down. KPj dropped 50 and 11 assists at 20 Years old
"With all due respect:  KPJ is a guy Rockets fans got hyped on because he's young, they got him from a bargain and he was one of the few good players on a shitty team  Jalen Green is about to show them what a legit franchise cornerstone looks like  They aren't in the same tier IMO"
Jalen green shot 70% at the rim in the g league for a reason
Honestly as a Jalen Green Stan I’ve been making this ridiculous take since the start of the draft process.   I am insane. But I am committed to my insanity.
"I get what your saying bruh and I agree to an extent but what is starting EG gonna do for us outside of showcase him for other teams to eventually trade him. He’s not in our future plans, Green is and by sitting him your not really helping him out. We’re more than likely going to be a lottery team with the chance to become a play in squad, but theirs no real expectations for this team outside of its top pick which is Jalen Green to be as good as advertised, so that’s why I say let him start from day 1"
Looool Jalen Green is broken
"“OH WATCH OUT, WHAT A MOVE” Play was out of bounds, and didn’t even result in a shot.  “KJ Martin couldn’t finish” It’s Jalen fucking green"
It's summer league but I'm going to overreact and say Jalen Green will be top 3 in PPG in about 2 or 3 years. Save this comment.
Jalen Green took going second overall personally.
JALEN GREEN IS DIFFRENT.
jalen green is gonna be a superstar holy shit
us 'jalen green is the #1 pick' guys are feeling pretty good
"Jalen Green just went #2 in a stacked draft because he averaged 18 PPG as a 18 year old vs grown men in the G-League. He isn't Kevin Knox or Kyle Kuzma, summer league is just confirming what we already know."
Where were you when Jalen Green saved the NBA?
is jalen green gonna start on the rockets right away or come off the bench?
Jordan wishes he was as good as Jalen Green
Us Jalen Green stans sitting super vindicated right now.   Holy shit this kid is disgusting.
Dang i'm seeing a lot of hate for jalen green in the cavs sub smh
im pretty sold on jalen green becoming a future star.  also love mobleys agility and defensive work on the perimeter.  i dont really believe in sengun yet.  think he got pretty overrated by mock guys because of his european accolades and we are just a few years removed from luka having two guys drafted over him after he dominated.
Might be the shorts but Jalen Green plays like a bigger and more athletic Jordan Poole
Jalen “Irish spring” Green - Flight probably
I think Jalen green will avg 20 ppg this year
Jalen Green almost died right there
Literally the whole cavs defense is watching Jalen Green on that play and he still finds his way to the hoop. Just wait till he has real NBA guys around him. Sheesh
jalen green is gonna be so good man. rockets fans got a good one in him.
Okay I’ve seen enough Jalen Green&gt; Kumingbust
2027 NBA Finals MVP Jalen Green
I see Jalen Green is going to the Ja Morant school of barbery.
Jalen Green is literally Kobe Bryant
That’s 2027 NBA MVP Jalen Green to you
Jalen Green so smooth in the PnR
I'm excited to watch Jalen green i've been watching him since he was 15
Let’s go Jalen Green!!!!
I am READY for some Jalen Green.
"Man I know that feeling all too well, I used to spend the summers in San Antonio with family and those spurs championships were incredible to watch. I'm a big mavs and rockets fan but I'm always glad when the spurs do good as well. I think Texas basketball is gonna have a big time resurgence soon with Luka, Jalen Green, and Keldon Johnson."
"I do not look forward to seeing Jalen Green matched up with Jrue lol, the difference in muscle mass will be jarring"
"It's just farfetched to think we wouldn't be just a middling playoff team with Ben, CJ, and role players (Nurkic would leave in free agency next year if Dame is gone). I could maybe see a one year trial run with that core but if it's nothing special I think it's best to blow it up. Like look at Houston, I think they rebounded fairly well after the Harden trade because now they have Jalen Green and some other young pieces to build around"
"To be honest though rockets are sitting pretty good after that draft. Jalen Green has crazy potentional, Sengun looks like he'll be good in the paint and solid overall, and Garuba will be a monster defensively."
"Considering Michael Jordan was actually 6 feet 4 and not the 6 feet 6 everyone always thinks I’d say the whole height thing is a little bit of a fan/media thing. Jalen Green plays tall if that makes sense. And Cade is clearly taller and bigger if you just look at them side by side. The important thing is how they use their traits to their advantage. Lighter guys normally have more flight and agility and guys like Cade benefit from being able to bully guards. So anyways, I’m trying to say it’s not that important how tall they are but how they use their physical strength to their advantage."
Speaking of weight differences. It amazes me that Anthony Edwards is just as explosive as someone like Jalen Green while being 45 pounds heavier.
Why cant Jalen Green play for the Philippines national team? They allowed Paolo Banchero to play for Italy’s team even if he played for the USA in a fiba game already. 🤔
Jalen Green in no way looks 6 foot 6 lol. and Cade is probably 6 foot 6-7 and Green 4
Nah that'll be Jalen Green
"i like jalen greens chances but it depends on if he has the green light to do what ever he wants, the only issue is the rockets also have a bunch of young guys who can score so maybe they would take some of his points"
"I'm not going to pretend like I didn't do that  I think my most recent Heat file has Kuminga, Moody, Cade, Jimmy, Bam, and Jalen Green lol"
The new one is likely gonna be Jalen Green and Josh Christopher playing in AAU.
"Man as much as I appreciate the positivity, we’re just too small to compete. Jalen Green and JC could hyper carry us but I highly doubt we’d be any good given that we’re always on a size disadvantage.  May Kai Sotto pa tayo lol"
2023 WC is gonna be so fun to watch - especially with Philippines in it. Hopefully Jalen Green and Jordan Clarkson suit up for Gilas so we have a chance at an olympic bid haha
"Anybody that thinks otherwise is ridiculous. This was on short/no practice, with 3 key players who played a Finals game the week before, some players who had the join on short notice and some potential players missing such as Curry, Kyrie, Harden, Lebron, Kawhi and AD. Team any of them up with KD and it would have been an ultimate joke.  2024 will have a prime Tatum, Booker and Lavine.  This year's rookie class (Jalen Green, Cade Cunningham, Jalen Suggs, Scotie Barnes and Evan Mobley) were blowing teams out by nearly \~100 points the last few years. They showed some incredible chemistry reminiscent of what the original Dream team looked like vs the competition and played lockdown defense. That 2028 team is potentially going to be special imo especially when you combine them with vets from the 2024 games which I'm thinking will potentially be Lamelo, Ant, Ayton, etc.  Remember, these NBA players are the 1% of the 1% of the 1% of the 1% of the 1% of the world's best basketball players and Team USA is the best of the best of that."
Ja has the best chance out of the west guards followed by Edwards but frankly don't see any new all stars for guard there esp w Westbrook back and on the Lakers   Actually Jalen green low key may get through on fan vote if the Pinoys turn out.
I think Jalen Green could make it
"Easily, trae/ja/tatum/zion/Mitchell/bam and i think kd may even play. AD is only 32 as well and can play. Then we got to see how Cade/Evan Mobley and jalen green turn out. They 3 looks legit."
Lavine can be something special. Booker with more hops and burst. But man houston got a special kid in Jalen Green he could be an even better Lavine.
"Jalen Green discussed wanting to be a defensive minded player as well, definitely don’t see him bad defensively for lack of effort"
"* Jalen Green will be a jordan clarkson at best * Raptors will commit to a full rebuild by the deadline trading Siakam,Dragic,Vanvleet and Boucher * Lakers dont make the finals * Bulls dont make the playoffs * Philly lose in round 1"
"Draymond Green, Danny Green, Jeff Green, Jamychal Green, Javonte Green, Jalen Green… who else?"
Jalen Green better become Michael Jordan lol
He stood next to Jalen Green and they were exactly the same height.
"Jalen Green, KJ Martin, and Josh Christopher are going to be so fun to watch"
"We’re about to get two top 5 picks within the next two years though, and if we don’t it just means Jalen Green is an absolute stud, our future is still very bright. Jalen Green wouldn’t be on Rockets if we traded for Jarret Allen just to pay a non shooting center $100 million. Maybe we didn’t get the best return for Harden but it allowed to go full rebuild mode and set ourselves up for the future nicely."
"Not really, we wouldn’t have Jalen Green without the Harden trade, nor would we have two upcoming lottery picks if Harden was still on the team. The way I look at it, the Harden trade is a win since we weren’t going much farther than we did in 2018 anyway and now we get to build from scratch."
"there's still a good chance the Nets picks far in the future will yield something. He's 33 before this season begins. Harden is 32 before this season begins. Kyrie isn't exactly durable either. This kills the idea that they could all leave next season and hand you guys like five straight lottery picks, but the last 2-3 years of picks could very well be quite high.  And don't forget, without bottoming out this year, you don't keep your pick (Jalen Green)... Even if you'd made the trade with Philly for Simmons, he raises your floor above hardcore tank levels and you lose that top 4 protected 1st. So Jalen Green is implicitly part of the return."
"Lol we got Jalen Green, Garuba, and Sengun but y’all worried about 27 year old injury prone LeVert and Allen with his $100M  The plan was to bottom out"
Are we? We got Jalen Green and 3 other rookies with potential. Rebuilding for the next 2-3 years  Y’all are in a rough spot. Need to find who’s gonna take Simmons
&gt;Jalen Green. Jalen Suggs. Jalen Johnson.... Jalen Duren.   Jalen stonks to da moon.
Jalen Green: My goal is to make an all-defensive team.  r/nba: Dude says he don't give a damn about defense.
"Bruh he's black. Also, have you not heard of Rui or Yuto Watanabe? Jalen Green and Jordan Clarkson are also half Pinoy."
Yeah but John Wall gets you Filipino Kobe-  Jalen Green
"LOL he was a G League ignite kid, playing with Jalen Green and Jonathan Kuminga. He was their PG"
1. Cade Cunningham 2. Jalen Green 3. Evan Mobley  4. Scottie Barnes  5. Jalen Suggs  6. Josh Giddey  7. Jonathan Kuminga  8. Franz Wagner  9. Davion Mitchell  10. Ziaire Williams
"Jalen Green easily.  Probably the best SG since MJ, he has all the right fundamentals."
"""The Rockets will spend $36M total on contracts of Kevin Porter Jr, Jalen Green, Christian Wood, JaeSean Tate, Kevin Martin Jr, Daniel Theis and David Nwaba. The Lakers are gonna pay Russell Westbrook $44.2M per yr."""
"Or another schedule you can go with:  - 12pm- Detroit Pistons vs Houston Rockets- #1 overall pick Cade Cunningham plays on Christmas against the #2 overall pick, Jalen Green. 2 Rookie of the Year candidates playing on Christmas   - 2:30 pm- Chicago Bulls vs New York Knicks- Knicks play at the Garden on Christmas against a new look Bulls team who could be playoff contenders  - 5:00 pm- Atlanta Hawks vs Dallas Mavericks- Trae vs Luka on Christmas Day for the first time ever on Xmas  - 8:00 pm (PRIMETIME)- Brooklyn Nets vs Los Angeles Lakers- At Staples Center you get KD vs LeBron...you get Westbrook vs KD...Kyrie vs LeBron...all on Xmas in one matchup  - 10:30 pm (nightcap)- Milwaukee Bucks vs Golden State Warriors- The Champs go up against the Warriors...Giannis vs Steph in the late night match up"
"Cade Cunningham, Scottie Barnes, evan mobley, Jalen green, Jalen suggs"
Jalen Green effectively act as a tank commander from day 1.. seriously tho if he could average 25 ppg on average efficiency It’s prob a lock for ROTY
"Cade Cunningham or Jalen Green, they'll basically have the keys to the offense from day 1 and probably gonna put up the biggest stat line  The others all have guys who will be competing with them for minutes"
For me I will say Jalen Green wins it with the Rockets
Jalen Green babyyyy
"Evan Mobley is basically going to be Giannis with a better shot at some point in his career.  That being said, I’ll go with Jalen Green, because I’m clearly biased."
Think Jalen Green is going to show out right away
"I’m still high on Ben Simmons. I think he needs the right situation paired with a sports psychologist. He could benefit being on a team that isn’t trying to contend. He’d have less pressure and a couple years to work on his game and mindset. I was thinking the other day how Kobe in his last few seasons would have been an excellent mentor to him.    I am lower than most on Jalen Green, luckily for him he’s got time to prove me wrong."
"Most people are low on Daishen Nix. Man, I love the guy. I like passers. Wish someone took a chance on him, and I was really hoping the Bucks would get him, would be a nice backup playmaker off the bench.  On the other hand, I’m not sold on Jalen Green. Might be reaaaaally unpopular, but in a few years time I could definitely see him adopt a Jabari Parker mentality of “they don’t pay me to play defense.” He’s a score first guy and… well, let’s just hope for the best lol."
Jalen Green is gonna lead Team USA to three straight gold medals
"This is a fun question.  I don't know if Pistons would value everything a contender could reasonably trade over Cade Cunningham.  Same with the Rockets and Jalen Green.  I could see the Cavs pulling the trigger to recapture some Lebron glory days.     I think he drops all the way to 4 though were toronto tries to make a run with FVV, Siakam and Jordan.  They might be able to bring Lowry back for one more year and attract some ring chasers.  They have had luck with one year rentals to chase a chip."
If this is what Kuminga can do in summer league what can Jalen Green do?
"Sharife Cooper is the steal of the draft (I’m biased but), Cam Thomas will find a way to crack the Nets starting lineup, Jalen Green will be the best player out of the draft, Kuminga second best."
The guys I wanted were Jalen Green or Mobley but we had no chance of getting them. I like Barnes though and I seem him as a mid risk/ high reward guy.    Even if he doesn't pan out completely and reach his full ceiling  I can still see him being a great piece on the team that brings great defense and some playmaking.
"Mobley i feel is a lot like Jaren Jackson Jr..Sengun Is prolly has a ceiling of sabonis prolly with more densive upside...Cade not being the best player is definitely a probabilty, There are player with immense potential in this draft Imo...Barnes,Giddey both could fit the Giannis prototype lead ball handler on breaks while being swiss army knifes defensively. Jalen Green could  be a perennial all star but tbh.. I don't see a face of the league level talent in this class"
I liked watching Jalen Green a ton.
jalen green will break melo's record for ppg by a teenage rookie
I think what happened was Jalen Green turned out to be so talented it made Kuminga look worse in comparison.   OKC should have taken him.
Him getting spanked by Jalen green sure is an interesting interpretation of what actually happened
Cade looked better tonight than Jalen Green has looked the entire summer league
The same dudes loving Jalen Green for being cocky are going to tear him doen as soon as he struggles too
bUt JaLeN gReEn Is BeTtEr
bUt JaLeN gReEn Is BeTtEr
Jalen Green wrecked him. Just sayin
"Lots of highlights tbh. That's why people are raving about this class. Jalen Green, Suggs, Barnes, Kuminga, Mobley etc.. gets highlights almost every game"
r/nba hates cade. Everyone here fell for jalen green and his weird looking suit on draft day and now they all seeing Cade as their enemy
"Not really, Jalen green fans got obnoxious asf after Cade first summer league game."
"Its easy to say that right now, but I see a couple of rooks right now not named Jalen Green winning ROTY. 🤣 Dude has been playing Summer League level for awhile now, should have been dropping 30++ points by now, dunking on their heads. The rest of the rooks finally adjusted to the level of play. Come NBA season lil boy will get bullied with his 145 lbs frame. 🤣"
Such a cocky ass thing to say after getting spanked by Jalen Green two days ago. He's a bust and I will die on this hill.  *sees statline*  Woaahh DAE CADE CUNNINGHAM GOATED
"Gelo Ball, Jalen Green and Jonathan Kuminga."
God damn Jalen green fanboys are obnoxious
Please for the love of god let us get banchero. I don’t ask for anything else. I asked for us to get jalen green and we saw what that did for us so we prob get 6 again somehow.
did we all miss the jalen green posts from the other day lol
Wow so much better than Jalen Green
that was better than any game i saw from jalen green so far
"Also, Devin Booker is 1/4 Mexican.  I get what you mean though. As a Filipino-American, the only Filipinos currently in the NBA are Jordan Clarkson (1/4) and now Jalen Green (1/8). Representation matters."
he’s dope but man Jalen Green and Suggs are ballers too. this whole draft was stacked.
"I see more non European white players in this clip than I’ve ever seen in my life. I wonder what changed. Btw I’m not one of those “plumbers” people I’m genuinely curious as a guy who wasn’t alive to see his era. And also I really wonder if Jalen Green purposely tries to move like him. I know a lot of late 90s off guards tried to as well, easier said than done, only Kobe kind of pulled it off."
People keep talking about how skinny Jalen Green is and how he'll have a hard time but MJ was pretty skinny his first few years and he was like two years older than Green. I'm not comparing Green to MJ but if you have the speed and work ethic you can get stronger and use your speed to circumvent your physical limitations.
"Yeah I caught the Pistons-Rockets game here in Vegas a few days ago and thought you guys looked great. Worth mentioning Jalen Green played most of the game where as Cade maybe did 20 minutes, people can’t really put much credence into games where starter minute discrepancy is so high. I think you guys top 30 wins easy, wouldn’t be shocked to see over 35."
"Jalen Green told the NCAA to pound sand, signed a half a million dollar contract, and got taken number two in the draft."
He was never a good playmaker. How does a prospect that has more TO than assist get called a good playmaker? I was never on this dude. Feom the start Jalen green was the answer to everything.
i had jalen green first before summer league started
Cade bummingham has nothing on Jalen first ballet  hofer green.
"Kpj was drafted the same year as dg and only a year later than Sexton. Even if you’re just someone that looks at boxscores you can see that dg and Sexton are better than kpj in multiple ways. Eye test should also tell you that they are, although kpj does have potential.  I mean even Corey brewer dropped 50 in a game. MCW had a legendary game against the heatles in his first game.  I know it was on jrue. I know it was impressive. But that’s one game. Kpj hasn’t been consistent at all, especially with his shooting splits. He’s also only played 70 some odd games and started less than a third of them.  I’m a cavs fan, and I really do want kpj to succeed, but you’re definitely overexaggerating, and many of the people here do it with kpj. Dude could be insane, but right now to consider him better than Sexton who’s an efficient 20+ ppg scorer, and dg who’s an efficient 17 6 nightly, that’s just not realistic.  It’s not because they’ve been in the league longer (dg literally hasn’t been) it’s because at this stage they’re better and should be considered as such until kpj and green prove otherwise (and they definitely can).  As for jalen green, he really hasnt shown anything in the nba yet. I would bet my bottom dollar that he’s *at least* an all star level player, but crazier things have happened."
Those 3 fouls are definitely being over looked lol. Especially since Cade had 7 for the game.  Any time Jalen beat Cade off the dribble he took the foul instead of giving up the easy bucket which skews the numbers for the individual matchup.   Cade played really good defense within the scheme.   But I would say Hayes was more of a problem for Green in 1 on 1 situations.
We didn’t throw double and triple teams all night at green. Most of the time we were single covering him. green handled the doubles pretty well when we did it   We threw a few double teams at him but that definitely wasn’t our primary way of defending him. Most of the time we put cade or hayes on Jalen green  Either way as you said it doesn’t really matter it’s summer league and both green and cade played pretty well and are very different players
"Recent example on draft night.  Reporter: ""Jalen, are you upset you don't go one? Are you mad? Are you gonna make the Pistons regret it?""  Jalen: ""Yeah, sure.""  ESPN: Jalen Green is gonna make Cade and the Pistons pay!!!"" (Repeat any time either one of them is mentioned)."
"In addition, Jalen Green and Jonathan Kuminga going top 7 in the draft shows that the Ignite can maintain and increase a high school player’s NBA prospects."
Jalen Green will win ROY in a landslide. Cade will adapt later in the year to make it more of a conversation but it will be too late. My prediction.
Dg and Sexton should both be considered better than kpj and jalen green until the latter 2 showcase consistency in the nba like the former 2 have
&gt;Is it the Pistons taking Cade Cunningham instead of Jalen Green?   Lol fuck you buddy
This is the most shoehorned analogy I've ever seen lol  Jalen Green should rep his Filipino heritage with pride tho they love basketball
Jalen Green is either gonna be loved like Anthony Edwards or hated like Russell Westbrook. No inbetween.
"""Stop trying to make Jalen Green happen."""
I BELIEVE IN JALEN GREEN SUPREMACY
"Yeah, Kobe was actually 6'4.75 without shoes and looks taller than Harden.  Jalen Green looks to be/has been measured to be about 6'5.5 - 6'6"" without shoes."
i am not seeing the playmaking out of cade that apparently put him above jalen green
&gt;Is it the Pistons taking Cade Cunningham instead of Jalen Green?  WTF Man
No lie Jalen Suggs is the best one out there then Green then Cade
The regular season is really gonna mess OP up when Jalen Green goes up against Jaylen Brown except Jaylen Brown is the one playing for the green team
[Jalen Green returns to Rockets bench during the time out.](https://twitter.com/Jonathan_Feigen/status/1425989633448439814?s=20)  Apparently said he was feeling tightness so this is pretty much precautionary.
Jalen Green and Kevin Porter Jr. will be one hell of a fun back court. It could have been us. 😩
2nd behind Jalen Green  Cade in the 2nd round
Is Jalen Green chewing gum while playing?
Yeah. People need to quit it with the “it’s just summer league” when it comes to Jalen Green  He’s good
"Alperen Şengün yelled out, “Işte gidiyorsun! Işte gidiyorsun.” Sharpshooter Jalen Green gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Josh Christopher yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before KJ Martin hit the locker room door, NBA great Rafael Stone hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
I like Jalen Green!
"Jalen Green is gonna be top 5 in PPG/scoring title race this year and will be a top 5-10 player in the league by his 3rd season.   Rockets wont make the playoffs this year, but will have a meteoric rise like the Suns did this year and led by Green and Sengun will make the conference finals in the '22-23 season.   I have believed in these two players since before the draft."
4). To add to number 4. I think high school players especially now that they can get paid benefit a lot more playing in the NCAA. I was confused all year why Cade was such a run away for the #1 pick when Jalen Green was balling his ass off in the gleague for an 18 year old. Go look at Green's gleague numbers and he was putting up the same numbers against pros as Cade was putting up against college kids that will barely cut it overseas. Yet Cade was getting all the hype. The difference between the NCAA and gleague is you can't put a price on the viewership and national spotlight the NCAA provides. And why does that matter well for one the difference between between being picked #1 and #2 is about $5million  over the rookie contract. But the big difference comes in the endorsement money. We don't know the figures yet but certainly the #1 pick has an advantage there.
"be careful what u wish for  ""The Philadelphia 76ers have traded Ben Simmons and Tyrese Maxey to the Houston Rockets for John Wall, Jalen Green, Alperen Sengun, and their 2022 first round pick"""
&gt;I’m knocking this guys claim that’s he’s an mj/kobe hybrid Jalen is a stud but IMO   Green does have that talent thats what Im trying to tell you even if he most likely will not reach based on odds.
I still think Jalen Green shouldve been #1.
People are wayy to biased to college bball for draft prospects compared to G league and international leagues.  It’s pretty telling how recent prospects like Lamelo and Jalen Green just look much more polished than their colleagues who went through college.
"Agree w/ the Bulls being overrated. Zach Lavine is miscast as a no1 option. They put themselves in position to make the playoffs and thats it.  Disagree with the G League point. NCAA has alot of cultural momentum, but I think a minor league system is a great way to get kids paid and in the NBA out of high school. Theres already been a couple of kids who went overseas bypassing college. Brandon Jennings, Lamelo Ball, Jalen Green. I think its great to give the kids options, and anything that can stick it to the NCAA is ok in my book."
"Barnes isn't a great shooter but he's not nearly as bad as advertised. His passing and rebounding, however, FAR exceed expectations.  Kuminga is raw but not nearly as raw as advertised.  Jalen Green is a monster.  As much as I hate to admit it, Suggs over Barnes was proooobably the right pick."
Jalen Green will become the new Jordan Clarkson.
"Some teams didn't believe he'd last 5 years because he had scoliosis. Others also believe that bulking up caused the injuries in Houston. It's why I don't get the hype when a player adds 15 pounds of muscle or something. There's always a downside.  Kobe bulked up 2003-2005, got injured and [returned to a skinny frame for the 2005-2006 season](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1b81cfc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+0/resize/840x473!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F45%2F432a382035335b5086cd77ef5e4a%2Fla-sp-kobe-bryant-81-points-20160121) where he averaged 35 ppg.  It has me a bit nervous about Jalen Green, because he has [skinny legs](https://storage.googleapis.com/nbadraft-theringer-com-cms/public/media/ringernba2021/players/JalenGreen-color-medium.png) that might not be able to handle the additional stress like McGrady. KD didn't bulk up despite much criticism and that may have actually been the right decision for his health."
"If kawhi is healthy giannis isn’t top 4, recency bias clouds people so much it’s crazy.   The 2020 lakers will be better than the 2022 lakers.  Clippers losing to the nuggets as catastrophic as it was was ultimately the best thing for them, if they made it to the WCF they would have lost to the lakers but the clippers front office would have looked at the season as a positive and not made the drastic changes that needed to happen.  Cade will be average, Jalen green will have some nights where he gets 30 on decent efficiency and some nights won’t be able to make a shot."
"If you're in a rebuild its completely immaterial who you're paying if you're not past the cap. The Cavs are rebuilding fine right now and theyve had the most immovable contract in the league for the past 3 years. Your capsheet is at least half full of minimum contracts anyways penny pinching during a rebuild is a red herring.   Chances are during a rebuild you've got bad money on your books anyways, and say what you want about Ben Simmons, he is the highest upside bad contract in the league by a country mile. Ben and Houston's 20-21 roster is a bottom 3-5 team still and that would never have impacted the chances of you getting Green. I'd much rather have Simmons and Jalen Green than KPJ and Green, and I like KPJ.   I just think the logic is flawed behind this take and it wrongly idolizes the Hinkie style process when we've really yet to see that Hinkie style process produce a legit contender since the Baby Thunder a decade ago now."
Your number 4 really makes no sense to me. The NBA created Ignite to make some money off of highly touted prospects and give them a chance to develop their skills against teams and players better than those in college. The NCAA does nothing for the NBA other than provide game tapes of players while Ignite gives both the players and the NBA a chance to make money. It also provides the NBA with more pro-ready players because it gives them the chance to go against some of the lesser NBA vets and other pros. If Jalen Green and Kuminga actually show out as the top rookies in this class then we’ll see that Ignite is actually worth it.
"Davion MItchell has impressed on both ends. He has no weaknesses   Josh Christopher’s defense and aggressive driving stood out  Cade’s poise and feel for the game is special   Jalen Green is a baller. Elite shot maker and has real combo guard potential  Deuce McBride is gonna be really good on both ends. His wingspan will frustrate guys  Sengun  Kuminga does not look as raw as I thought he would  Suggs is not just a transition guy. He’s good in half court and is a pest on defense  Mobley looks really raw but he needs to play with a guard, he can’t create for himself yet  Scottie Barnes is still raw offensively but the defensive tools are crazy  Sharife Cooper might be the steal of the draft, if he can really shot 3s, it’s over. He won’t get the PT he needs in Atlanta tho  Jalen Johnson should not have fallen to 20. Front offices really thought he randomly quit on Duke smh"
I didn’t watch any g league games so seeing how smooth Jalen Green scoring is is ridiculous. Also Sengun looks really damn good
"Because it’s Max Strus, if Jalen Green or Cade hit the same shot it would be one of the hottest post on the sub"
Jalen Green
Jalen Green has star power written all over him already
"Jalen Green has taken/averages fewer shots than Mobley, Suggs, Cunningham and a number of other rookies. In fact he doesn't even take the most shots on his own team.  For a player touted to be little more than the best scoring prospect, he's been surprisingly the most all around player so far."
"Jalen Green, didn’t think expect this type of efficiency from him right away.   I don’t think any rookie has performed less than expected, summer league is an adjustment period for some rookies."
"If he and Jalen Green keeping rolling like they are now when the regular season starts, I bet the G-League ignite team is going to be regularly getting top prospects every year."
Not really. Isn’t it correct that Jalen Green is a top 2 talent and Kuminga is a top 10 talent?
Cade crosses over Jalen Green: Jalen Green is a bust.  Rockets beat Pistons: Alperen SenGOAT. Cade Bummingham.
Jalen Green exists
"Lmfao.  I love this 180, a week before the draft y’all were saying he’s better than Jalen Green."
Will Wall let Jalen Green grow or be petty and hinder his growth?
Jalen Green would've gotten 5 points ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
Jalen Green leading us to a (Summer League) championship. Like the prophecy predicted 😤😤
If Jalen Green led a turnaround from 17 wins and the worst team in the nba to the finals he would be appointed as the second coming. No one except a few idiots are going to talk shit. Maybe they would when they bring his name up in GOAT debates.
Good for fantasy basketball and draftkings! Other than that he looked like a shell of himself he's going to be that old vet in a rotation soon enough. Especially now that Kevin porter Jr and Jalen Green will need all the PT if they want to win some games
"It seems like a logical trade to make for the Raps.  Siakam is really, really good as a 2nd/3rd option beside a ball dominant scorer, and pretty mediocre if he's being relied on to create offense. He has way more value on teams that already have a star than he does on Toronto, and keeping him there is just wasting his prime and killing his confidence.  It might make sense to hold onto him if the Raps had an RJ Barrett or Jalen Green or somebody like that who they hope will develop into that go-to guy, but they don't. It's better for everyone to swap him for young assets the team can build around."
Lamelo Insta followers 7.1 million   Jalen green 1.5 million  This type of stuff shouldn’t be a question. Lamelo has had fame since he was a freshman in high school and was in marvel commercials this summer   This is nothing against Jalen but their markets just aren’t even comparable rn
I hope Harden ends his career with the Rockets. Imagine seeing The Beard with a grey beard playing alongside Jalen Green in Houston.
Ain’t no way unless Jalen Green is 6’8 or something.  Look at them side by side. He’s barely taller. There’s no chance he’s 6’10.
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
"He's old news and will never live up to former expectations.  All eyes are on Kai Sotto now, who played with Jalen Green in the G-League with the Ignite team and will be doing a stint in Australia this coming season in hopes to boost his draft stock."
Hmm Jalen Green has been getting superstar calls
Jalen green looks more confident than immature.. he is pretty humble actually
Is he immature? Jalen green doesn’t seem that immature to me  He’s cocky but lot of the greatest players in the league were cocky.  Cade and green are different people and you can be successful with either personality type that they have
"Marketable? It’s Lamelo by a long shot right now. What Green has going for him is an aesthetic game and his looks lol. In every interview I’ve seen of him I haven’t seen a face of the league personality. He’s young tho so that can change  Better? I think I gotta go with Jalen right now. He has a better shot to be the best player on a championship team but that depends if Lamelo improves his scoring because players are going to want to play with him. Not crazy ball dominant, unselfish and exciting, seems like he’s having fun out there. Very similar to Steph in that way. Oubre has already touched on how things seem to changing there in Charlotte"
Lamelo has already proven to be an NBA playmaker and a pretty great player at that.  Jalen green is still an unknown.   Lamelo Ball is the answer
He has proven more in a g league.. obviously both are still too early to tell anything.. but jalen green so far look like up to expectations
To me honest jalen green look like the real sure thing out of this draft.
"It could go either way, unlike Cade, Jalen Green isn't humble and is very immature. Sometimes that can help"
"Here in the Philippines, basketball is like a religion yet there are only few players who had a chance in going to the league. Jalen Green is only half-filipino so i think that doesn’t count lol."
Jalen Green should be higher. Probably #2 or #3
jalen green is top 5 imo. thats one pretty mfer. idk bout mile bridges or dillon brooks tbh
"Funny, but a couple rather massive issues that would make it unfeasible:  - how do you determine which deal is better?  some deals are obvious, but a lot aren’t. Is a non-lottery protected 2026 pick from the Bucks worth more than lottery protected 2022 pick from the T-wolves that would roll over? Different people would come to different conclusions. Add in different motivations by the ‘selling’ team and it’s especially difficult to sort ‘automatically.’ The Lakers’ offer for CP3 would’ve left New Orleans a ‘better’ team, but one stuck in the middle of the league, at best. The Clippers’ deal was ‘worse,’ but allowed them to bottom out and be in a position to draft AD. Same with the Harden trade. Philly’s offer of Simmons and other compensation would’ve left Houston a ‘better’ team, but they wouldn’t have been able to bottom out and draft Jalen Green and potentially set them up for the future.    - What about other players on the ‘selling’ team?  These trades invariably include multiple players going out, not just the want-away. How do you compare deals when the offers may include different players being in the differing offers?  - these kind of deals more often than not involve 3 or more teams to try the kind of assets directed to who wants them. You’d have to effectively make every team and player a possible participant in every auction. And then you have to judge the deals by what’s best for every team. Good luck with that."
🔥🔥  Posting Jalen Green propaganda on r/CadeCunningham &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

Jalen Green in his rookie debut this year
"Rookie, Jalen Green."
"The obsession with point forwards and passing is what Led to guys like Ben Simmons being overrated for so long.   Generally, the best NBA players are the best scorers, all time and current. The exceptions are very unique guys who are DPOTY level guys with elite passing and rebounding (draymond), and all of that still doesn't put him over Klay who's only a better scorer. Guys like Kawhi are a top 10 scorer and top 5 defender and ranked at a similar position as Luka who is a top 10 scorer but not even a top 50 defender. At least 2 of the best 3 players ever ( Kareem and Jordan) and two  of the 3 best scorers ever. I also would have picked Jalen Green over Cade for the same reasons. The best player right now is KD even with GIannis being better at so many other things. The best scorers are the best players."
DORT Then probably Jalen Green
"Yeah, at the end of his contract I don't understand why he wouldn't want to team up with MVP Jalen Green, MVP KPJ, and 2 time all star Christian Wood"
Jalen Green???

"Awards:      MVP: Steph Curry      Finalists:      Giannis Antetokounmpo      Nikola Jokic        I predict the top 3 seeds in the West will be the Jazz, Suns and the Warriors. Out of those 3, Steph is by far the best player and MVP candidate. If I'm being honest, Giannis and Steph are tied, and I have Steph above from bias. Both have fantastic narratives but that favours Steph, both can have fantastic seeds but that favours Giannis, both will have elite MVP stats, both will have voter fatigue but Giannis moreso, and I think Steph will go harder in the regular season. Jokic 3rd because like why not, he has a bit of everything, Trae probably 4th.        DPOY: Giannis Antetokounmpo      Finalists:      Draymond Green      Rudy Gobert      Rudy won't win it again. Simple as that. Not for atleast a few seasons. Draymond 2nd because of the seeding leap the Warriors can take. I think Giannis's focus will be more on offball offense and defense this year as the Bucks have focused on getting offensive upgrades this offseason.        ROTY: Cade Cunningham      Finalists:      Jalen Green      Scottie Barnes         Cade will have the best impact metrics because of how he will get the keys to Detroit and that's it. Detroit is Cades team already and that'll decide it. Barnes playmaking and defense already looks nice and Green is just too flashy and his scoring is super impressive at his age, they'll be top 3.  &amp;#x200B;     6th Man: Tyler Herro      Finalists:      Kevin Huerter      Dennis Schroeder  &amp;#x200B;  After his sophomore slump, I can see Herro taking a leap. His team will take a leap and he'll pair fantastically with Lowry. There isn't really any strong 6th man favourites to me, so I just threw in Huerter and Schroeder who's teams will be better this year.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Most Improved: Jordan Poole      Finalists:      Bam Adebayo      OG Anunoby       Jordan Poole has taken quite a leap once again, and his increased role will lead to a big stats leap. He's flashy and more importantly, the media is already acknowledging him. That's a key factor. Jokic became the MVP favourite because everyone just acknowledged it halfway through the season, I think it'll be a similar thing with Poole. Bam had a nice looking midrange last season that was gone during the playoffs, but with the addition of Lowry, I can see him not only taking an individual leap, but taking a statistical leap twice over due to Lowry. OG looks like his offensive arsenal has expanded massively, and while I don't know too much about him, I know he's one of the top MIP candidates/  &amp;#x200B;  COTY: Steve Kerr      Finalists:      Monty Williams      Mike Malone  Draymond, Steph and Poole are all high on these awards and Warriors will take a massive leap, easy.  &amp;#x200B;  EOTY: Marc Eversley      Finalists:      Bob Myers      Andy Elisburg  Just guys who made unexpected leaps in the seeding as GMs"

"i disagree. i think he’s already a front runner.    cade, jalen green, scottie barnes, giddey, bouknight, duarte, trey murphy, sengun, jared butler, davion, bones. i don’t see anyone else getting enough minutes to qualify for the discussion. suggs looks like he’s a little more of a project than anticipated."
"I find it so funny that GMs really think Jalen Green is going to win rookie of the year over Cade Cunningham. Cade can defend your best player, he will shoot from the perimeter, he will get all in yo' mug. He is the most complete rookie in the game today - bar none."
"Cade is going to be as good as he was advertised pre-draft. Somehow, as soon as the draft ended and Cade became a Piston, everyone became a hot take artist that Jalen Green is better and Mobley will also be better. About 1/4 of the way into the season, he will start running point full-time and we will move Hayes to the bench for josh Jackson or diallo."
I think KPJ having all star potential is about as likely as any of our guys.  He’s a gunner being forced into a square peg.  I just can’t see him and Jalen Green working long term.
Jalen green plays like a 6'5 Monta ellis
MVP: Luka Doncic   DPOY: Rudy Gobert   6MOY: Jordan Clarkson   ROY:  Jalen Green   MIP: Michael Porter Jr
"Josh Giddey will win ROTY  Cade is gonna have a good but not great rookie year and Jalen green is gonna have bad efficiency numbers. No one else in the class will particularly standout in their rookie year. But Giddey has played awesome in preseason and in OKC, he’ll have all the opportunity and trust that he needs to be successful in this first year. I can see a 14 7 and 7 type of season from him. Similar to Ben Simmons rookie year"
"The the Magic hands down.  Isaac is a right wing nut who is made of glass.  Cole Anthony is a great dude but doesn't have the size to be an impact player.  Suggs hasn't played a game but I'm not convinced.   Honestly if we are talking young players to be excited about, I still think RJ Hampton has the most upside of anyone on our squad. Which....is sad.  The rockets blew up their team like 8 minutes ago and they have Kevin Porter Jr., Jalen Green, and Alperen Sengun-- all who have all star ceilings.   I'm so jealous."
"Kat will get injured yet again, 1/3 of the laker team is moved by the trade deadline, jazz get the 1st seed but don't get to the ecf, Jalen green wins roty, Luka mvp"
"Jalen Green scores 24.3+ PPG, making him the highest scoring rookie since MJ"
"Jalen ""Brandon Crawford"" Green"
"Be the change that you want to see and post scoring highlights.  Whether you like it or not, defense and smart plays get the people hype. Jalen Green catching a pass was a top highlight from yesterday.  Julius Randle had a hype scoring play. If the others don't, it's not bias. Seems you have your own internal biases to struggle against."
Probably slides in 1 or 2 spots below Jalen Green

Damn. Jalen Green has some ugly shooting splits in pre season. Thought he was the ROY favorite?
"I disagree. Mainly because Mobley is a more unique player. It's more difficult to find a big that's mobile and can guard 1-5. You can build your defense around him. A pure scorer is much easier to find. Jalen Green is not only raw on offense, but I have trouble seeing him ever becoming a good defender. A good scorer, bad defender like Beal has way less impact in the game compared to a elite two way big like AD."
"I heard Jalen Green is a highlight reel, but Primo looks more exciting to watch. Had more highlights in 7 minutes than Green in 30 minutes"
"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"
"How dare fans want their players to succeed. I'm sure you just want Jalen Green to be a pretty good roleplayer, right?"
Jalen Green
I hope Jalen Green turn into a superstar
"Now: Steph, Harden, Luka, Dame, either Mitch or Book (No order)  5 Years; Luka, Trae, Ja. Book, Jalen Green"
Now I strangely want to see Jalen Green and Sengun in some RDCWorld videos
For the people that keep saying exposure. Do y’all see how much exposure Jalen Green. Got he had a ton on that team. Also y’all really overrate the college experience for the athletes. They wouldn’t have to worry about keeping their grades up for a year. And they’d be making $500K. Sure you can they nab an NIL deal not every player is going to get one of those. The Competition is also better in the G-League as well
I looked it up and it seems like Jalen Green got $500K which seems like a fair amount. I'm curious if that type of salary will continue to be sustainable and competitive with NCAA NIL rule changes and enough to overcome exposure differences.
The G-league being a “viable option” or an actual alternative is recent phenomenon. I mean I think it was really Jalen Green who really demonstrated that going to G-league won’t hinder your success.  You have to give it a while before we start to see the effects of this
"Are you a Rockets fan? Because they are going to be terrible to watch this season. Jalen Green will be entertaining at best, but the rest of the roster is a gong show."
"6/15 shooting is kind of deceiving given how many 3s Tatum took (10). He ended the game with 20 points on 56.7% ts, a bit below average but not awful especially given he normally starts the season slow. He had 2 more points on way worse efficiency in his only other preseason game vs the Magic than he did against you guys.  Beal did only end up with 7 points on 27.4% ts and Jalen Green with 5 on 41.7% ts though."
Lol Jalen Green has
"Did we watch the same guy?  He was given the hardest defensive assignment in his last 3 games: Tatum, green (who is admittedly a rookie also but ok) and Beal.   He has some troubles with Tatum but between Scottie and OG they held him to 6/15 shooting.   Young Jalen was outclassed, he’s a rookie so I get it, but held him to 2/6.   Beal was clearly frustrated by Scottie. Held him to 1/11 shooting.   His defense looks great so far. I just want to know what you’re looking at, because his knowledge of Nurse’s schemes is already extremely high and he’s holding his own for a rookie on that end."
"Probably nothing, they succeeded in launching Jalen Green into the top 2 of the draft by giving him the green light to score whenever he felt like it."
You don’t want him to mentor KPJ and Jalen Green? 😭
G league ignite it's the development team owned by the NBA. Jalen Green and Jonathan Kuminga.
"Keep bringing in young talent. I watched Jalen Green, Kuminga, and co. more this year than I have ever watched the G-League before"
That wasn’t my point. It wasn’t a “gift”. If we traded for Simmons we probably only get 2 extra picks and he also probably takes us out of keeping our pick.   Jalen Green + 4 pick swaps + 4 first round picks &gt; Simmons + 2 picks   And don’t give me the bullshit about “oh just flip Simmons for more assets”. If the Rockets could find a 3rd team they probably would have. But as you can see right now it’s pretty difficult to trade Simmons.
In my unbiased opinion MVP: Devon Booker MIP: Mikal Bridges DPOY: Deandre Ayton 6MOY: Cameron Payne ROY: Jalen Green
Jalen Green was a 5 star recruit and the #2 rated player in his class. Zaire was a 3 star recruit and unranked in his class. Not really comparable.
Zaire is not good. He barely played his senior year at Sierra Canyon and only had interest from DePaul. He opted to take another year at a prep school called Brewster.  This isn’t the same as Jalen Green skipping college because no college even wanted Zaire.
I mean maybe and very likely but you got Jalen Green who skipped college to go to the G League and got picked #2
MVP- Trae Young  MIP-Keldon Johnson  DPOY-Anthony Davis   6MOY-NAW  ROY- Jalen Green
"Excited for top 3 guys and Bouknight the most  Cade cause he’s got all the tools to be a great player, multi level scoring, create his own and for others, and can be great defensively given his height and wingspan. His main weakness is his athleticism and being turnover prone in college. He can work on both overtime.  Jalen Green is just a walking bucket, could really see him winning a scoring title. His game makes me think of Kyrie with how electric it is and he’s athletic as shit. He’s gonna struggle with consistency most likely and I don’t think he’ll ever be more than a solid defender (and he’s looked bad defensively so far), but I do find him having success as a premier scorer.  Evan Mobley is who I was extremely high on cause he has all the tools to be a really fucking good PF/C, like best in the league at his position. Which is his greatest weakness because he may not reach said potential.  Then Bouknight is someone I hoped we’d potentially trade up for. He’s just fun to watch."

Jalen green should be 18-20 where anthony edwards was last season
"Assuming the text above is a joke/sarcastic: absolutely, he's a scrub, trade him for Josh Primo.  If it's serious: Jalen Green had one of the best defenders in the league on him the entire game, so I'ma say no, he's probably fine and he just had a rough game dealing with 5-year-veteran defence as *literally* a preseason rookie. OBVIOUSLY NBA defense is a massive step up from lower levels of play, and everyone, no matter how good, needs time to adjust to that."

Jalen Green approves
The floor for Jalen Green is probably like Drexler / wade level
"Good thing you asked Wizards and not us Rockets fans.   I think it's an almost universal hatred for Westbrook for Rockets fans as he killed our team, costing us James Harden, Capela, CP3. Ending our run of contention.   Seeing Westbrook hopefully destroy the Lakers is our greatest hope for the season (along with Jalen Green/KPJ)."
pretty sure jalen green will take this
Jalen Green
Probably: Jalen Green   Underrated pick: Josh Giddey
"I think Rookie of the Year will be Jalen Green  In terms of who I think will be Rookie of the Year of the Year, I think Kevin Durant. He’ll have the best season out of any former rookie of the year, so he’ll be the ROY of the year"
Jalen Green  If not him then I guess I could be persuaded for Sengun or Christopher
Jalen Green is a polished scorer and gonna have the reins on a bad Houston team. It's all lined up for him.
"Name a single draft where a team got that many you g dudes with this much upside. Two of these guys were studs over seas, one of which was an MVP of one of the best international leagues at just 18 years old(ring any bells?), and two other guys in Jalen Green and Josh Christopher who are both look like fantastic picks from all of the information and tape we do have on them.  It’s not outlandish to think this could be one of the best drafts by a team, if not the best. Hell, I’d say it’s one if the most impressive jobs by a GM in a two year span if you look at the young talent they’ve acquired over the past two seasons."
Zach Lavine top 5 in MVP voting Lakers have a mediocre regular season  Jordan Poole MIP  Jalen Green 22/3/4
Ehh yeah I guess y’all would lol. Also I just wanna say Jalen Green is going to be a fucking superstar that kid can fucking ball. I have him as ROTY
Jalen Green might have an outside chance.  Could have a few massive PG13 games as well.
So basically the Pistons are Jalen Green but in the form of an entire team.
Ok but this list is actually garbage though. Even ignoring the Barnes placement. How on earth is Mobley 4th? How is Jalen Green 1?
"Kelly Oubre, Jordan Clarkson, Jalen Green"
His turnovers and lack of feel for the position is mainly what I’m talking about. He’s not a pg and the experiment is stunting the growth of Jalen green
"Houston. Even as a 76ers fan, those are my 2 favorite jerseys I own (Hakeem and Yao) mashed into one. Definitely getting a Jalen Green one"
The way you described him made me think of cam Payne.  I don't watch games with jalen green but does he play sorta similar to cam Payne?
"[This cover](https://theundefeated.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/si_cover_lebron-e1487176174981.jpg) was February 18, 2002   Jalen Green was born February 9, 2002   Wild!"
And how fast does Jalen Green run?
"I bet you they won’t be a bottom 5 team. They look a little discombobulated because they are putting the pieces together but they will start figuring it out. I even called the Bulls were getting big time slept on. People were saying they were a fringe playoff team. I can point you to a post saying they are a top 16 team in the nba and I said they were way higher than 16. I got shifted on… but I’m calling the same with the Rockets. They aren’t quite a playoff team but they are basically a mini Timberwolves team rn. Just like last season how people thought the Timberwolves would be complete ass… if they had not gotten any injuries last season they would have been a fringe playoff team. Now this season they are balling out. I’m just sayin…. These rockets have some really good fire power in KPJ, Jalen Green and Christian wood. They aren’t exactly like the Timberwolves this season, but they are almost what the Timberwolves were last season."

"He's still athletic compared to NBA standards, I'm saying he's no longer athletic compared to prime Russ standards. Before, every open lane given to him was a mean dunk. Even the highlight poster earlier blowing past Jalen Green, you can notice there's not a lot of air in him. He could still do it every once in a while but not as often anymore. Search Westbrook violent dunks on YT for comparison.  Lastly, it's not just the dunks but layups and finishing around the rim. He's more prone to missing point blank layups, etc. This happened even during his final years in OKC. On the other hand, prime Russ going 100MPH past 2-3 backpedaling defenders was easy 2 pts"
"Jalen Green, Sengun, KPJ, KJ Martin, Garuba"
Jalen Green just watched his childhood irl 😂
Jalen Green just watched his childhood irl 😂
Jalen Green just watched his childhood irl 😂
"My observations for Jalen Green:   It's not the missing shots that worries me. It's that he can't even take advantage when Reaves was guarding him one on one. He is also surprisingly limited offensively. It's either difficult step back 3s, or running full speed inside and throw himself in the air hoping to get a call. He needs to learn to use rymthm, sometimes slow down, not just run on one gear. Also that dribble is suspect and needs a lot of work. Shot form needs work too. Don't even get me started on his defense. He gets bullied by everyone, and he got out run by lebron and Westbrook in a chasedown? At least try to foul them instead of letting him dunk on you.    On scouting report he had a 9 for NBA ready score, (mobley had 8) but he is no where close to that. There's some false advertising there for his NBA readiness"
"Ok KPJ is not a pg at all, please stop forcing Jalen Green to play next to him."
jalen green is 19 and got out sprinted by lebron lol
They’re using Jalen green like hes PJ tucker
cmon jalen green i wanted to see more from you :[
&gt; Jalen Green has the potential to be a future MVP  That's not a fair thing to say tbh.
Jalen Green will never be Lavine. Wtf is wrong with this thread?
Jalen Green has the potential to be a future MVP   i don't think he needs to be tainted by John Wall
Definitely not jalen green. I’m very sad as a rockets fan
Jalen Green definitely has Space Jam 2 in 4k already
Jalen Green just barely doesn't qualify for that lol
He'll probably be great one day but Jalen Green has looked pretty overmatched every time I've seen him so far lol  To be fair it's a very tough situation to be playing big minutes right away without many players to cover for you
that dunk was  nasty - everyone picking on jalen green tonight
"sad, jalen green is a worthless bust"
He legit outran Jalen Green. I don't think people realize just how insane that is.
Can 60 year old Christian Wood stop chucking threes?! I’m tryna see Jalen Green smh
It's all about Jalen Green development and tanking for them this season.
They might as well run the whole offence through Jalen Green then
I would take Mobley and Barnes over Cade or Green.   Cade and Green are so underwhelming. I will be shocked if Jalen Green is a better player than current Jordan Clarkson.
"[Jalen Green yesterday :"" Kinda look at Lebron like a Superhero](https://streamable.com/zmhvuu)"""
Jalen Green just lost a footrace to a 50 year old.  That's just embarrassing man.
Why not try to get Jalen Green the ball? He being guarded by Reeves rn
Why has Jalen Green only played 5 mins??
This KPJ and Jalen Green duo is not it. 2 blackholes and no playmakers. Reminds me of Cavs and SexLand.
"I meant more in terms of pre draft the consensus for the top 4 were Suggs, Mobley, Cade, and Jalen Green. Scottie Barnes then came into the picture in the last month or so but even then most pre-draft had the 4 I mentioned be drafted 1-4."
those jalen green dunks are crazy.
"Cade's stat-line is the headline but even as someone who thought Jalen Green was more deserving of the first overall pick, Cade actually didn't look too bad.   His 1-8 from the field looks a lot worse because he went 0-5 deep. He clearly still needs to get his legs under him and get back into playing shape. He looked good on drives, was good about moving the ball. Having a 7:2 assist to turnover ratio is pretty good -- especially given the fact that he is a rookie still looking to develop chemistry with his team and adapting to the NBA game. Plus, his hustle on the defensive end was awesome to see.   Pistons winning a game where Bey went 4-17 from the field is a great sign."
“Jalen Green tho! But Jalen Green!”
"According to [NBA.com](https://NBA.com)'s  official measurements, Cade is indeed 6-6, but without shoes, whereas Jalen Green is 6-4 without shoes.   Lebron is 6-8 without shoes."
He only played 19 minutes.   Also before people overreact Jalen Green scored 9 on 4-14 in his debut
Jalen Green : Am I a joke to you?
"All-Greens:  Jalen Green, Josh Green, Jeff Green, Draymond Green, JaMychal Green.   6th man: Javonte Green"
Nuggets are preparing a trade package for Jalen Green as we speak
no?  I believe he can be an all star caliber guy and can be a great scorer and playmaker (20/8) but I don't think even Jalen Green might be as good as Harden
"I don’t get the big playmaker hype. The best big playmaker in the league is Jokic, and every big playmaker prospect drafted is more like Ben Simmons i.e. athletic wing/big PG playmaker. Those players have been useful in today’s league but none have impacted the game like a playmaking BIG (as in Jokic).   Obviously tall PG’s have been incredibly useful over the history of the league (Magic, Kidd, Penny, etc) but in today’s league we’ve seen that the most useful guards are quick and great shooters (Trae, Steph, etc). Simmons and Ball seem to be the only big playmaker that’s payed off in recent memory, and even then neither of those players could carry an offense as well as a guard like say Fox.   If you have the #1 overall pick and you have potential #1 options like Jalen Green or Evan Mobley that look more like other top options the league has had recently. Time will tell if Cade can be that type of player but just off of past looks I gotta agree with others here that the Pistons should’ve took risks on either Green or Mobley."
Just need to acquire Josh Green and Jalen Green and they'll be winning games with one snap of their fingers
"Gotta be one year removed from your highschool graduation, doesn't say anything about playing college. LaMelo ball played in the NBL, Jalen green played in the Gleague."
69% of Rockets fans would **still** draft Green over Mobley:  https://www.thedreamshake.com/2021/10/28/22750576/sb-nation-reacts-jalen-green-houston-rockets-vs-evan-mobley-cleveland-cavaliers-results  LOL
&gt; Jalen Green was never gonna turn into Kobe lol  Well in that case he's probably not worth a #2 pick. The Kobe comps were a part of the pitch.
Well I mean Jalen has a pretty nice 3 point shot (Has been pretty terrible so far but he was good in G league and SL) and he's probably a better athlete than Wade or Kobe tbh  Lavine was his draft comp due to the 3 level scorer and freakish athleticism and Green can probably be even better than Lavine while being a great defender too
Jalen Green was never gonna turn into Kobe lol  Likely ceiling is like a 2 way Zach Lavine who's easily a superstar but wtf
"I think he has a higher chance of turning into KG than Cunningham turning into Larry Bird, or Jalen Green turning into Kobe.   So I'd probably take him above Cunningham or Green.  Obviously an oversimplification. But at the end of the day the goal is to stockpile GOATs like KG, Kobe, and Bird. So I think distilling players down to their chances of turning into all time greats is a good criteria."
Jalen Green has been the most Rockets player ever so far
As a rockets fan i love jalen green but damn mobley is a monster.
Exactly! I'm glad im not the only one who has seen this  The other day Jalen Green got slapped in the face ad it was a no call. Meanwhile on the other end a ticky tack foul gets called for the other team ( also happened vice versa where we got a soft call and one of our players hammered their guy and no call)  Refs need to call it more consistently
I would've taken Jalen Green so I don't really give a fuck about Evan Mobley
Then say that in the first place idgaf about your jalen green take.
"Comparisons are always based on potential. Jalen Green obviously isn’t Lavine right now but there’s a comparison to be made. Mobley obviously isn’t AD right now, but there is a comparison to be made. This is common knowledge."
Obligatory fuck Jalen Green
"When people make draft day comparisons, they aren’t talking about they are now, that’s silly. He got the Giannis/Simmons/Draymond/Magic comparisons not because he’s going to be that good his rookie year obviously, but because for a 20 year old to have the size and strength he does along with literally being a PG in college and a primary playmaker there, you can see how he can fall into that archetype.  It’s like if I went and made a post saying “Jalen green is averaging 14 points and shooting 34% from the field, why does he get Zach LaVine comparisons?”"
&gt;there will be no shitting on Jalen this game Raptors Fans    Jalen Green can suck my balls
"Chant doesn't even make sense lmao. He wanted to play here, it's not like a Jalen green vs detroit situation"
Most 1st overall picks wouldn’t.  If they were in this last draft class at 23;  Anthony Davis wouldn’t have gone 1  Kyrie Irving wouldn’t have gone 1  Jalen Green wouldn’t have gone 1
"No, It would’ve been Jalen Green"
I appreciate an honest rockets fan when analyzing Jalen Green. Although no one can deny that he’s got “it” as far as star potential and scoring ability. Same thing with Mobley and now Scottie showing their potential. I hope Cade can live up to the hype and show why he belongs with those guys
Haven’t seen one highlight of Jalen Green
All this to just say Jalen Green for ROTY lol
"After watching Scottie, Mobley, and Jalen Green ball out so far this year Cade better be the real deal or this is gonna be Darko 2.0"
Jalen Green bringing the short shorts back. Love to see it for a change.
Exactly lol. Jalen green literally got smacked in the face while airborne going for a dunk… no foul   These refs are over compensating for calling bs on the perimeter last few years
"I'm talking of chances of making to the NBA or at least Euro league in terms of height alone.  If you are at least 6'5"", you would have been 1 in at least a million Filipinos. So there may be 10-30 of you who are that tall. Hence, the chance of you getting to the NBA is slim to none.  Comparing to other countries where they are genetically tall, the chances of making to the NBA or Euro league is higher.  JC and Jalen Green are not even pure Filipinos, but that's another discussion if a pure blood Filipino will make it to the NBA. There's a tiny chance for Kai Sotto to be one but in terms of genetics, his height is an abnormality for a Filipino."
Anyone else think Jalen Green looks like Cam Newton if Cam didn't eat anything for a year?
"Not only that, you get to see young Jalen Green and young Sengun fuck around with nothing at stake"

What about Rookies? Jalen Green is just chucking the ball and taking awful shots rn
"What I like about em, despite growing in the USA they embrace their heritage without the pandering.   Jalen Green is a player outside my favorite team that I root for heavily."
"He's a superstar in the making but that doesn't say much lol, he's competing with  Beasley, thabeet, Evan turner, Derrick Williams, MKG, Oladipo, Jabari Parker, DLO, Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Bagley, Wiseman, Jalen Green  On a serious note, 5 of those players are out of the league which is pretty absurd"
We are perfectly happy with Wall.  We needed a tank commander and picks.  Without that trade Russ would have won us a few more games and cost us our pick this year (OKC had it with lottery protections) which turned into Jalen Green.  Our FO has been great thus far and all our picks this year look great.  I'm sure they'll turn that '23 Wiz pick into somebody decent.   Without the Wall/Russ trade our rebuild would have suffered a major setback.  Wall's contract will be done by the time we're really ready to make some noise so it doesn't even matter.  We gained so much and gave up nothing.  Knowing how things turned out we make that trade again every time.
"you right. mobley to me is right behind scottie. jalen green is not gonna have a great season. i do think he’ll be the best in this amazing draft class, but it won’t happen right away."
Listen to me. Jalen freaking Green.
"Definitely an exciting player either way. I'm also really high on Jalen Green, but the thing with Green is that we see his archetype of player a lot. Ja Morant, Fox, Lavine, even Harden are all kind of explosive first step players with loads of skill. Sengun is just so unique, by contrast. You guys got some great ones in those two!"
Rockets are a poverty squad at this point. Jalen Green would be electrifying in orange and blue tho 👀
Houston has been a lot more likeable since Harden left. Also all the filipino Clarkson fans are loving Jalen Green.
"Damn, Jalen Green is chucking em haha"
Jalen Green is actually getting better but he just can’t hit a fuckin 3pt shot
Who would have thought Evan Mobley and Scottie Barnes are better scorers than Jalen Green lmao
Jalen Green 3-16 says I just shoot like ass.
"Every time I see Jalen Green highlights I think ""damn he's really good"" and then I see the box score and I think ""damn he's kinda ass"", and then I remember its literally been like 5 games and hes a rookie and I should take it easy on him"
"Jalen Green is probably the rawest player out of all the top picks. I don’t think he’ll be ROTY but once his frame fills out and he learns about hesitations, deceleration, he will be a problem for sure"
"Damn, Rockets giving away free Jalen Green shirseys tonight and no one showed up lol"
Jalen Green finally gets free throw attempts!
Jalen Green 😎
"Love his game already. Once he develops the offense to match his already nutty defense and bulks up a little to bang down low he's going to be unstoppable. Jalen Green is a lot of fun, but I really have no idea how Mobley fell to #3."
But you said jalen green was right in response to a post about us doing bad which has nothing to do with location
Guess Jalen Green was right 😬
"Is it just me, or does anyone else see the similarities between him and Jalen Green?"
Jalen green is gonna take a bit to fill out and truly reach his potential as an elite scorer. Barnes and mobley are just more NBA ready.
to have jalen green and cade in the top 100 and not rj was insulting af
"won’t be the last time that happens during his long and fruitful career. even if cade and jalen green eventually surpass him, it’s so obvious that he’s gonna be a high level player for a long time. he looks durable af"
"Unless Barnes or Mobley collapse, they're gonna finish in the top 2 voting. They're getting the numbers AND they're helping their respective teams win. Best Jalen Green can do from this point out is just get numbers"
"Until the goal post moves again once Cade and Jalen Green get going, yeah. Barnes is legit tho and he should finish top-2 in voting with Mobley being the only real competition for the award."
If jalen green has an Anthony Edward’s like resurgence like last season I can see him making it as ROY
Do people really still not realize how much Jalen Green is better then Cade? He played in the Gleague vs college and one cant score 20 the other had cracked 30pts
"If he has done enough to earn it then I don’t understand the issue. It’s not like anyone else on the Rockets not named Jalen Green is likely to actually get one. If Wood prices himself out of what the Rockets are willing to pay then we either trade him or let him walk. Again, don’t see why that would mean the Rockets should be even think about that right now. Wood has 2 seasons to prove he’s worth what he thinks he is."
JALEN GREEN IN HIS BAG. 🍿🍿
"Yet @houseofhighlights will tell you Jalen Green, who was 3-14 from the field tonight, was “in his bag.” What a joke of an Instagram account."
"Complete offensive player is what his elite ability is going to be. Player that is on ball and run the offense through pick and rolls. Can score at all three levels(shooting poor right now), elite passing and play making ability and transform your offense. If you’re looking for elite athleticism and pure scoring go find Jalen Green. Pistons are playing Cade off ball right now a lot due to coming off injury and playing with Killian. He’s not totally in the role he will be in for his career where the offense flows completely through him."
"Jalen ""Marv Albert"" Green"
"Jalen ""Kevin Durant"" Green"
"Jalen Green is probably the best example of that in this draft class, he's shown flashes of the guy he can be, but its all very streaky right now"
"Fr lol. Jalen Green is one of the most inefficient scorers in the league rn yet his TS is still higher than names like Fox, MPJ, Vucevic, Clarkson, Dame, Tatum, Russell, and Beal"
I figured something was wrong when he went to the back after that contact with Jalen green but he returned
Fucking man of culture right there.  Jalen Green. Anthony Edwards. These two dudes have me questioning my sexuality with every interview they take.
Averages don’t mean much 7 games into their career. I’m looking at skill set.  Jalen green has put it together in 2 games while being terrible in others. He looks like he has a chance to eventually put it together consistently and be one of the better offensive threats in the league.   But it’s also possible green doesn’t put it together ever. It’s not mobley hate to see why Weaver and Stone elected for more offensive upside
This has gotta be bait or something he threw Jalen Green in there too
"How many Rockets games are garbage time start to finish? When is Jalen Green gonna get called the worst rotation player in the league because he's only getting numbers in garbage time lineups?  And Wiseman wasn't even bad defensively. The numbers support this and so does the film. He fouled a lot, like most rookies do and that shouldn't be an issue this season. But he also deterred guys from the rim with his freakish length. His real negative impact was pretty much entirely on the offensive side where the team was giving him post ups and outside shots. But with a shorter leash and better defined role, he'll look a lot better this season."
Jalen Green
Jalen Green  Ignore my flair
Jalen Green
The disrespect to Jalen Green? I get his team isn’t doing well but damn
Yo that second one wasn't a travel? They called that same shit on Jalen Green yesterday against the lakers
honest question though... what's the team building strategy?  Don't start a true rebuild until Pop leaves?  Spurs are in a dead end while Rockets have a chance for another top pick to put by jalen green next year.
Spurs: lose kawhi and tread water in mediocrity for years.  Rockets: lose harden and immediately tank for a franchise piece in jalen green.  wyd'ing spurs?
"Hard disagree.  With Ja and LaMelo, the shooting upside is hypothetical (I think over a longer sample size LaMelos shooting will be closer to 34-37 percent). What you’re excited about with Ja is the paint game and playmaking. Shai is second in the league in drives per game, and orchestrates the offense incredibly with 10.5 potential assists a game- the fact he only has 3.3 speaks to the terrible shooters on OKC.  If Jalen Green manifests to have an SGA caliber season, that will be a big win for the Rockets- the point of a rebuild is to acquire a Shai level player.  The only advantage is that they’re younger (Ja is a year younger than SGA exactly) and cheaper, but OKC is currently struggling to get to the salary floor. I think I’d rather have SGA than Ja, and we’ve seen the Thunder struggle to create spacing around a poor-shooting PG for years.  The argument against LaMelo is less clear, and I would wager that if you provided SGA the level of spacing of the Hornets, we’d see a new level of play from SGA. Right now SGA shares the court with 7 players shooting under 34% from 3 compared to LaMelo’s 8 OVER 34%."
"Duarte is shooting at a way better percentage from downtown at a higher clip, if we want to compare.   But Jalen Green does good amazing!"
Jalen Green?
Both teams played well. Rockets we're hitting their shots and the Lakers stars all played great. The Lakers had a comfortable lead with 2 minutes left (?) And all of a sudden became a close game due to a possession literally being taken away. It changed the game.  Then Jalen Green hit two wild but amazing shots and it became really close then.   The refs wronging the Lakers and them not playing to the standard they should be is both correct.
feel like Jalen Green guna be better than Cade
"Houston should probably be...  Lock in: Jalen Green, KPJ, Jaesean Tate, Sengun, Garuba, Josh Christopher, KJ Martin, Armoni Brooks  Move on: Wall, Eric Gordon, Danuel House, Nwaba  Uncertain: Wood, Theis, Augustin, Garrison Matthews, Daishen Nix  Only trade Wood if we get a can't miss offer that helps the rebuild. Theis and Augustin are good bench players for this year, but they are not a part of our long term plans so they're under ""Uncertain"". Nwaba could be under ""Uncertain"" too, but he's pretty average and his skills overlap heavily with Tate and KJ Martin. I'd rather just move on from him and give minutes to the younger guys."
Jalen Green &gt; Cade
Where is Jalen green ?
"IMO it should go: 1) Scottie Barnes, 2) Franz Wagner, 3) Chris Duarte, 4) Evan Mobley, 5) Jalen Green"
I love Jalen Green
Don’t know why you getting downvoted. Jalen Green was far superior on that Ignite team
"Exactly, I do hope that this should not happened again in the future. It should have been an easy fix if they noticed it within 24 seconds thou. Someone pointed out that it's also the scoreboard's fault and not just the refs.  It didn't really change the outcome of the game in the end but it did cost a couple of heart attacks from the fans and from the Lakers players.   Thou most of it is due to the greatness of Jalen Green, it could have been different if the Lakers didn't lost an extra possession."
Lakers won AND Jalen Green balled up?   r/NBA in shambles
"Obviously he's off to a horrendous start, especially when you shift your gaze to rookies who have been playing well so far like Mobley, Wagner, Duarte, and I daresay Giddey.  But isn't he coming off an injury and zero preseason play? He's clearly trying to do too much (like Jalen Green is) right now."

"It's interesting how every analyst and scout was raving about Jalen Green having an ""It"" factor, but this game is honestly a pretty good explanation of what that means.  It's rare to see a 19 year old with completely unwavering confidence. He got his jump shot blocked by AD, but he went against him 1v1 again and wasn't scared to shoot it again in a crucial late game possession.  He is definitely the type of rookie to make tanking teams fun to watch."
Bust. Jalen Green is going to be the best player from this draft.
That Jalen Green 3 at the end of the game was a sick shot
All that to beat a 19 year old Jalen Green by 2 points
There was a guy that asked if Jalen Green was a chucker after 5 games. This sub really has gotten comparable to twitter.
"I never thought Cade would be like this, I just always thought Jalen Green was better since their highschool days but somehow, I think playing in the Gleague affected his draft stock. Scouts have always put higher regard to college ball.  Feeling kinda vindicated so far ngl."
All I know is Jalen Green is ROTY
Give the kid a chance. We haven’t seen enough for Bust talk yet. But wow Jalen Green is already amazing. The Pistons always pick the wrong guy. Detroit took Stanley Johnson and Luke Kennard over Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell.
Josh Giddey Jalen Green Scottie Barnes Franz Wagner Evan Mobley
The Chad Jalen Green vs the Virgin Cade Cunningham
I also think that Jalen Green will have a better career than Cade
"He missed a lot of ramp-up time and it’s been two games. Jalen Green didn’t look phenomenal either earlier, but is looking better now. There’ll be ups and down"
He been elite in the league longer than Jalen Green has been alive
"Yeah I’m with you. Jalen Green is a willing and motivated defender but a very bad one still.  Physically he just doesn’t have the girth and he might never but we’ll see. If he becomes a good defender, it should be about 2-3 years of body development IMO"
That whole fourth quarter was a mess everywhere. Jalen green was clutch though
Jalen Green is gonna be amazing for this league. What a gem.
Cause Jalen Green too good sadly
Ball didn’t lie after Jalen Green sky fucked us lmao. Ball is an asshole
Jalen Green: 17/3.6/3.6 on 37% from the field  Scottie Barnes: 18.1/8.9/2 on 55% from the Field  Scottie &gt;
Jalen Green should've taken the last shot not KPJ especially when Jalen just hit back to back 3s.
Jalen Green a stud tho
"Jalen Green tho, made my lose my shit lol"
Jalen Green is a fucking monster.
"Really wanted that W. Jalen Green is something special, man."
Jalen Green ROTY
Jalen Green is special
Mashallah jalen green
It's crazy how Jalen Green is already better than Michael Jordan.
This is all set up for Jalen Green to have the best moment for a rookie since Zion vs the Spurs
Jalen green trying to avenge Houston sports by himself tonight
JALEN GREEN GAME WINNER INC  win or lose another embarrassing showing by the championship battle tested lakers
They lost 120-119  Jalen Green hit a buzzer beating 3. You posted too early
JALEN GREEN JUST BUILT DIFFERENT
If Jalen Green hits a 3 right here he's winning ROTY off of that alone
Wow Jalen Green with ice in his veins
I need a Jalen Green gamewinner pls
Jalen green just won rookie of the year
I LOVE JALEN GREEN!
Jalen green says block that!
Holy shit Jalen green  That was nuts
"Jalen Green man, What is this dude?"
Jalen Green is different
Jalen Green this sexy motherfucker
JALEN GREEN
Jalen Green is gonna ruin a lot of people's nights over the next 10 years.
wtf did Jalen Green eat today  what are those shots
Is Jalen Green the GOAT?
Jalen green sheesh
Wtf Jalen Green back to back rainbow threes
"Jalen Green is balling, good to see him bounce back"
"So many passes off target, and he dies on almost every screen. I don't see him as the right fit to put next to Jalen Green. He's a natural scorer, and not much else has developed thus far. I think he becomes an effective 6th man, but not really a good starter."
"I don’t get this. Jalen Green had one good game. At least on paper. Admittedly I’ve only watched one of his games and it wasn’t the one vs the Celtics. Tonight he’s been fine, but overall he’s not had great numbers. Why are some people on him like he’s been the best rookie this year? I’ve even seen an article that had him number 1 in the rookie rankings. Now I really like green and think he’s going to be a stud. But it’s not like he’s setting the world on fire, even as far as rookies go."
"I think the issue is how good guys after him are looking, esp Jalen Green"
Hopefully Jalen Green cools off in the 2nd half. Or the Lakers play actual defense for FS
Jalen Green ROY copium
I love Jalen Green. That is all.
We on a first name basis with jalen green now? Aren’t there like 9 jalens lol
"Sengun has looked better than Jalen Green in the early goings, honestly.  Needs more minutes."
About to daddy Jalen Green tonight
He could be Jalen Green.
Kpj &amp; jalen green 2.0
If I meme Jalen Green maybe my Rockets will be good next year.
"Yea man you don’t actually like, know my team. Let me help you out.  Jae’Sean Tate is a bonafide hustler. Any team would love to have him. He never stops. He’s like Patrick Beverley with more overall talent and capabilities. He is far from trash so your statement alone is not only unwarranted, it’s amateur.  What you have is a group of guys with little chemistry, and inexperience. Kevin Porter JR is playing PG, which is new to him. He’s learning to keep his dribble going. He’s used to catching a pass, making a move, and either scoring or dishing out. But now he’s in control of the offense. That’s a huge brain switch for any player at any level. He scored 50 pts in a game when Wall was still playing. He’s very capable, just needs time. And he shoots under 12 shots a game…not a chucker in the slightest.  Jalen Green is the rook. But man his ceiling is HIGH. I’m not trying to compare him to the other rookies. He’s Jalen. He’s gonna be a pure star in this league.   Imo - sengun has the higher upside and more IQ than Wood. Wood is a very good complimentary player. He’s not a KAT like coach thinks he is."

Jalen green tho
"His development is likely to be even across all areas, as well.  Jalen Green gonna have leaps on offense but remain rough defensively for years, if not his entire career."
"Give me one on Jalen Green - the few summer league games I thought he had great BBIQ and was going to tear it up, but I have no idea what to think now"
Rockets fans we were here pre-Morant. I don't know if Jalen Green will be that type of piece but hopefully you'll draft a stud and revive yourself.
KPJ and Jalen Green both busts I'm afraid
"Rockets franchise seems in disarray from top to bottom  Owner is one of the worst owners. Coach is too passive in installing hierarchies. GM has done a relatively good job, and players ice out Jalen green so hard out what I would presume is spite to dismiss him as the cornerstone of the franchise. I see Tate do this all the time and wood throw fits as well.  They need law and order"
I saw so many pistons talking about how Cade is a winner and jalen green is a flashy loser…you’re on the PISTONS
Start DJ Augustine and bench Jalen Green. Simple. It literally couldnt not make them suck anymore than they already have.
I’m very much concerned Jalen Green is developing bad habits
Jalen Green account 😮
Those guys showed flashes in their early years too. I’m more saying that his rate of development will take longer than someone like Barnes or Jalen Green.
"If we're being honest, Sengun has looked a lot better overall and adds a noticeable impact to the games. Jalen Green... not sure what to think about him yet. He needs to work on improving his overall game, nobody wants a black hole on offense who gets points and nothing more"
"He was also doing so at a 32% usage rate, the highest in his career, at his lowest assist rate (6.9). Idk he just always looked like a score first ball hog to me, and i *guess* that could help Jalen since he’s a better passer than KPJ. But I’d rather have the ball be in Jalen’s hands.  Like right now KPJ’s at 24% and Jalen Green 24%. Throwing Wall in there lowers their usage for a guy that will look for his buckets primarily"
Jalen Green has been absolutely atrocious so far.
"I guess so, but what is stopping Shai from forcing a trade if the team doesn't put talent around him immediately? Like, why would he want to waste his time on a perennial loser?  It's the same thing I'm scared of with Jalen Green and is what is happening with C Wood right now. These guys don't always wanna go through growing pains."
Jalen green would really benefit from John wall playing instead of this guy
"Sengun’s father liked a tweet saying that Jalen Green was “absolute garbage” as well, but he unliked it  https://twitter.com/HakeemThe_Dr34m/status/1460217104267886598?s=20"
"I’m worried for Jalen Green too. Obviously we can all harp on about how it’s early days, but what I’m surprised by is his inconsistent ability to get past people. He has insane vertical, but his first step doesn’t seem as promising as you’d expect.   Off ball movement is non-existent in the rockets offense until Sengun has the ball.   I’m very much praying that Jalen develops well over this and next season, but usually top draft picks that become superstars basically explode onto the scene. I’m not seeing that with Green yet."
"it doesn't mean much, but he's doing well as the youngest player in the NBA. younger than Jaden Hardy, Paolo, Chet, Jalen Green, etc. it means as much or as little for him to do well as it does anyone else, like LiAngelo."
He was straight up tormenting Jalen Green and Kevin Porter Jr last night
Lots of young guys playing.  KPJ is learning how to be a PG and not just an iso scorer. That's not easy to do and it's 10 times harder when you have the roster he does.  Jalen Green isn't even close to as ready as people initially thought. He's not even close to as good as Edwards was at the same point last year and we all know how rough his start was.
He’s younger than Jalen Green and playing way better in the G League than he did (so far)
"Green has a green light - his jumper needs new mechanics, he’s too weak to get by people, and in general he can’t create his own shot. So the coach has to put him in better positions to succeed than letting him try to iso iso iso.   Like for example - Silas could run some lob sets (a 1-up pop or box special) to get Green lobs to catch. Use his freaky athleticism and make him a lob threat as the G League Ignite did.   Silas could also get him to cut more. Backdoor cuts, cuts off screens, back screens. He’s one of the quickest players in the NBA - use that!  Silas isnt putting Jalen Green in a position to succeed, he’s not maximizing his strengths right now. It would be great if Green could create his own shot right now, but he’s too raw for that, so Silas has to run some plays to get him easy looks instead of sticking him in the corner like he’s PJ Tucker."
Him and Jalen Green look long af
"Depends on the context. In the context of Jalen Green-people took how he played too seriously. It was somewhat clear his play wouldn’t translate to the nba. I thought my comment was pretty clearly just referring to him. But also Reddit isn’t exactly full of nba execs, coaches, and staff. Lmao"
Why would’ve thought that Jalen Green wouldn’t even be the Rockets best rookie.
"I get it. Jalen Green is shooting like absolute shit and so is his AST-TO ratio. Not even close to being ready.  But if you look at what CLE did with Sexton and Garland (okay they weren't as horrible as Jalen is rn) but the idea is the same. Just give them a green light, let them learn from their mistakes since it's gonna be a tanking/rebuilding season anyway.   Obviously, if he isn't showing progress or loses confidence/motivation, that won't be good. But the idea is to stay optimistic and let the player figure out how to play good NBA basketball (plus help from coaches)."
"Jalen Green is having a similar rookie season like Jordan Poole, efficiency wise and that says something about how bad his start of the NBA was."
KPJ is wildly inefficient and Jalen Green has been even worse from a TS% standpoint. High ceilings but there are going to be growing pains.
"-Jalen Green coming out a bit more NBA ready than he actually is  -KPJ picking up the PG role easier than he has  -Christian Wood putting up 20/10 like he was last season  I can see how if all these things came together, they wouldn't be 'worst team in NBA history' bad, but OKC also has a history of avoiding losing"
They tried. Silas even benched jalen Green in crucial time and played Eric Gordon trying for a win but it didn't work.
"I guarantee you from todays game i can find you multiple instances of each of those actions. You really think having Jalen Green spam pnr’s with wood will not lead to success. We run floppies for Green multiple times a game where hes catching and shooting off the wing, he’s just bricking them. Lets face it we know nothing about coaching in the nba"
Evan Mobley is the only player on your list I would even put in my top 5 honestly...that's not to take anything away from Cade and both Jalen's but this draft class was absolute loaded! some of these guys are only19-20 years old and in 3 years the list could look very different! but there are two rookies in my mind who are pretty clearly special.. Scottie Barnes and Evan Mobley look like they are going to be the next crop of super stars in the NBA  1. Scottie Barnes (Super Star potential) 2. Evan Mobley  (Super Star Potential)  3. Josh Giddey  4. Chris Duarte 5. Franz Wagner 6. Cade Cunningham (I expect his shooting to improve over time)  7. Jalen Green  8. Davion Mitchell 9. Jalen Suggs  10. Alperen Sengun
Jalen green hasn’t played good but man they need a real point guard facilitating that offense. Kevin porter jr is a shoot first guard who provides nothing else besides scoring.
Jalen green sucks
jalen green looks like he's lost all his confidence.
James Harden came off the bench his first year. He never had the green light that Jalen has right now in his first year.
"Jalen Green definitely underperformed his expectations. He's shooting 35.8%, And 28.9% from 3. How do you call that good? That's worse than last year's Edwards who had a atrocious start"
Jalen Green looks good
"&gt; My fav is that he apparently has a higher ceiling than Jalen Green.  Holy shit lol. Granted I haven't watched too many Rockets games, but the flashes I've seen from Jalen Green so far puts his potential ceiling at like an other-worldly player."
"I also have high hopes for Jalen and Cade and I'm sure their orgs do too, as we're just about 12 or so games into the season, I'm not sure any regrets should be on the table just yet, I mean Trae and ANT didn't necessarily light the league on fire in their first few games but about halfway through it clicked, so hopefully that can be the case for Green and Cade."
As long as KPJ is playing alongside Jalen Green it is true he will limit Green's potential.  Nothing more frustrating when I watch the Rockets then Green turning invisible while KPJ's usage is way too high.  Wall would help Green's growth so much more.
"Damn I did not realize how bad KPJ has been this season, no wonder Jalen green is struggling he needs a real point guard to play with."
My redraft:  1) Evan Mobley 2) Scottie Barnes 3) Cade Cunningham 4) Chris Duarte 5) Jalen Green
1. Ja Morant 2. Zion Williamson 3. Evan Mobley 4. Lamelo Ball 5. Anthony Edwards 6. Scottie Barnes 7. Cade Cunningham 8. RJ Barrett 9. Jalen Green 10. Darius Garland 11. Tyler Herro 12. DeAndre Hunter 13. Jalen Suggs 14. Tyrese Maxey 15. Josh Giddey 16. James Wiseman 17. Patrick Williams 18. Cole Anthony 19. Franz Wagner 20. Jordan Poole 21. Jonathan Kuminga 22. Cam Reddish 23. Alperen Sengun 24. Matisse Thybulle 25. Tyrese Haliburton 26. Rui Hachimura 27. Chris Duarte 28. Deni Avdija 29. Immanuel Quickley 30. Davion Mitchell  Kevin Porter Jr. has to be one of the most overrated assets in the entire league.
"It is true, the reason he worked out for Detroit is because Cade had a really bad workout for them, so they held a private workout with jalen green and Mobley because they reportedly werent completely sold on Cade and the decision to draft him vs green vs Mobley was a lot closer than internally than it was when they initially won the lottery. Mobley declined to work out for the rockets because they straight up said they were drafting green and flew him in on a private jet lol"
"Whilst he's not putting up the most points, he's consistent as fuck, and he's already basically a DPOY candidate as a rookie. Fuck Jalen Green, our mans Evan Mobley is winning that hardware."
Lol go read the Rockets sub right now   So many KPJ posts. My fav is that he apparently has a higher ceiling than Jalen Green.
Jalen Green and Cade
My Jalen Green pick is looking not so hot right now.
"Somehow the narrative went from ""he's not an elite athlete like Jalen Green"" to ""he's a bad athlete."" Yes, he's not Jalen Green, but Cade is still an amazing athlete. Cade is a great athlete and has the intangibles that will make him a superstar."
Don’t underestimate the writers who vote for this award. Edwards had it in the bag last year and they fucked around and chose LeMelo for the hype. Wouldn’t be surprised at all if they choose Jalen Green for the exact same reason. Those regular season awards have been ass for a couple years now.
"Rockets fans got really butthurt at me for saying there was nothing Jalen Green could do to win ROY and that it was a two horse race between Mobley and Barnes lol. Raps fans are cool, but Houston fans are legit awful"
imagine drafting jalen green
This doesn’t account for Jalen Green becoming prime MJ 20 games into the season though
Jalen Green
"We’re tanking at this point too, and just because you have a better record by 1 less loss, doesn’t mean you have a better team.  And tell Jalen Green to do something other than being a mid rookie. He’s been selling for me in fantasy"
"They’ve been getting blown out a ton lately, and Jalen Green hasn’t been doing much for me in fantasy"
Jalen Green and since I'm a Warriors fan - GP2
Jalen green deserves a shout
Im convinced people aren't watching Jalen Green right now. Maybe he gets better in the future but he stinks right now. He and Jonathan Kuminga are the same level of project player to me. If he's not scoring he does literally nothing else.
1. Evan Mobley  2. Scottie Barnes  3. Jalen Green  4. Josh Giddey  5. Franz Wagner  6. Chris Duarte  7. Jonathan Kuminga  8. Davion Mitchell  9. Cade Cunningham  10. Alperen Sengun  11. Cam Thomas  12. Jeremiah Robinson Earl  13. Jared Butler  14. Sharife Cooper
Jalen Green has some real swagger about him already. He's going to be fun to watch in the coming years.
"You're an idiot lol Jalen Green is too skilled to bust, he's gonna be all-nba one day. Mobley might end up being Hakeem but Green will still be a star."
maybe if jalen green played well you’d see more about him on here
"Expect it at this point. Someone who really shouldn't pops off for 20-30 on us. (See Jalen Brunson, Doug McDermott, rookie season Tyler Herro, Jeff Green, Mo Wagner, etc)."
"i would still say no matter what we could’ve gotten way more for such a great player, but i just see people say they should’ve got levert or simmons or whatever and i don’t see it lmao. if we get simmons we end up like the spurs we’re the last 2-3 years. a good player who won’t lead us to or through the playoffs, and then we’re too good to get a  top pick. not to mention we’re paying him and john wall max contracts. if we trade for levert, we likely won’t end up with kpj AND jalen green as well, and we’re stuck w a 27 year old who won’t take us anywhere but won’t get us a top pick, and we’re paying him 17th l a year. i think getting the picks and rebuilding was the smartest thing to do.  as for wall idek man i feel like we just have to pray a team that’s all in underperforms and is willing to take him for some expiring deals or whatever. idk what to do w him but i hope we trade him and get off hsi contract"
"Out of curiosity, is Jalen Green popular there since he's also part Filipino?"
"Perhaps. But it ain’t all about the person’s body. Steph and Jokic ain’t world beaters when it comes to physique. Jalen might well end up worse than Ant, but nobody can make that claim now. The best we can say is “Edwards is, right now, as good or better than Jalen Green was projected to become.” I don’t think this, though, is true. So we should be patient.  Admittedly, if I am buying stock in one of them, I am buying Edwards stock. But that’s mainly because he is a much safer investment at this point."
Jalen Green for me reminds me of Young Jordan.  Especially with how he moves around the court.
Anthony Edwards is better and in year 2. Jalen Green is more potential than results (like most rookies are early)
"He hurt his knee trying to trip Jalen Green while setting a screen, and Jalen just charged through his outstretched leg. Karma, baby"
I think we need to include Jalen Green in this conversation. The dude might be the most explosive leaper I've ever seen and he's one of the fastest in the nba already
"Jalen Green, Lavine, Ja, Ant, Giannis would be my picks so far this season. All freaks"
Jalen Green stands out to me in terms of athleticism
"Good question but I must say every time I watch Jalen Green, his athleticism jumps out the screen. Only other player I feel that way about in the league currently is Ja"
Hes better than anyone on that team not name Christian Wood. And please dont say Jalen Green or KPJ
Enforcer John Wall protecting Jalen Green from opposing players
Given that our pick last year was owned by OKC with a lotto protection we needed to tank hard.  Russ was going to win us a few games and derail the tank.  His contract was also terrible.  We effectively flipped Westbrook's bad contract into Jalen Green and a '23 protected 1st.  We gave up nothing of value and gained a ton.    We would have been fools to not take that trade.
He can't be this unplayable. We've been watching KPJ for 10 games and it doesn't look good. What could go wrong to pair Jalen Green with Wall sometimes?? They are already tanking anyway.
LaMelo&gt; Jalen green
"&gt;Fuck Jalen Green, Pistons fans hate him cause he called Detroit a shitty city and he’s getting booed by the whole arena when he comes here  Ahhh so you’re a hypocrite. Gotcha.  &gt;I’ve seen a Raptors fan say “I hope Cade stays injured all year so Scottie wins ROTY.” Literally praying for an injury, praying for them to rot in hell  I’m calling cap on this. You’re lying."
"I’m sorry to burst your bubble. But absolutely no one is trading Cade, Scottie or Jalen Green for KAT. That makes 0 sense"
"Yeah I agree. I don't think he's a longterm fit for Jalen Green, unfortunately. I think Green would do better with a defensive pass first PG. A Rondo type."
"Doesn’t matter for Pistons fans. We just want stability, not some hot head making flashy plays every game while not getting any success as a team  Jalen Green will be a top player, but I just don’t think he’s what we needed when you look at where the Pistons are at as a franchise"
"I checked - in terms of talent potential most definitely. I went back to the 80s and couldn't find another team even close to that prospect level - I mean they had all 5 top 5 players from the draft playing in it and they never came close to that before.  They did have Steph, PatBev, DeAndre Jordan, and Beasley in 2007. And Seth, Klay, and Hayward in 2009. But if Mobley, Haliburton, and Barnes continue their trajectory and even 1 of Cade, Jalen Green, or Suggs turn into a superstar then this is definitely goat U19 squad by future talent."

"Raptors fans don't be disappointed, we still got Jalen Green and if he played in college he would have gotten a lot more recognition but chose to go G-League. He's a bonified multi-level scorer and the top SG from the pack."
Raptors gonna pick Jalen Suggs if Mobley/Cade/Green off the board?
Cavs in a weird spot with Jalen Green or Suggs the most likely picks with 2 small guards already on the team
"I'll take Jalen Green, he's a bucket"
#GO GET ME JALEN GREEN
"Warriors should package 7th, 14th, and a future pick to move up into the Top 5 to get one of the really good guys (Jalen Green) and swindle one of the poorly run franchises up high in the draft."
Toronto with Jalen Green would be insane.
"Jalen Green is the real deal, whoever gets second/third needs to get him."
"Jalen green seems like a more hype, less chill Anthony Edwards"
"I foresee many Jalen Green, Jaylen Brown, Jalen Rose jokes."
top 5 draft picks according to nbadraft.net:      1	 *Houston	Cade Cunningham	6-8	220	PG/SG	Oklahoma State	Fr.     2	 *Detroit	Evan Mobley	7-0	215	PF/C	USC	Fr.     3	 Orlando	Jalen Green	6-6	180	SG	G-League	Fr.     4	 *Oklahoma Cty	Jalen Suggs	6-4	205	PG	Gonzaga	Fr.     5	 Cleveland	Jonathan Kuminga	6-6
Davion Mitchell and Jalen Green impress me more than Cunningham and Mobley
Jalen Green reminds me of Kobe
Jalen green to Orlando lol
Jalen Green will be the best player out of this draft watch.
Depends what team but I think jalen green or jalen Suggs
Whoever gets Jalen Green is getting a future NBA great.
Jalen Rose picking Jalen Green because he is the original Jalen
Jalen green will be great value Bradley Beal
Jalen green hes the next mj
"Man, if Jalen Green goes to Charlotte that backcourt and the Jordan mentorship would be incredible."
If they get Jalen Green that could be a young fun team
No jalen green will
If I'm Charlotte I'm taking jalen green first cade and ball would be redundant.
"Cade Cunningham and Evan Mobley are top two for sure, with some cool G-League players like Jalen Green"
"We have a Jaylen, Jaden, Josh, Jarrett, Jarred, Jake, Jordan and Jauncho on the roster so clearly the Wolves are drafting 3rd and adding Jalen Green."
"I mean shai is already all star caliber and hes 22. You basically assume that cade will be their best player eventually. Then you get to choose one of jalen green, kuminga, mobley, suggs. On top of any potential trio with shai, cade, and one of the four. They have 2-3 first round picks in every draft from now till 2026, which they can eventually package for whoever they want if their trio pans out. I'd say they are in a far better position than the sixers if they get 1 and 5 tonight."
I really hope the Pistons can get either Cade or Jalen Green been awhile since the Detroit has had a real star or Orlando
So OKC (college) and Cade Cunningham Timberwolves (hometown) and Jalen Suggs Timberwolves are selling Timberwolves have a young upcoming roster I think Timberwolves get the second or third pick is the rigged  Warriors/Kings get Jalen Green

In no way would I be in favor of trading the rights to Jalen Green or Jalen Suggs for Ben Simmons.
Jalen Green is going to be the number 2 pick most likely.
JALEN GREEN PLS
Jalen green. He’s already a polished scorer with elite athleticism.
"I'd personally like to see Charlotte move up again, not like there's any bias or anything. No bias at all. *Quickly removes user flair*.  In all seriousness, I would like to see Charlotte move up to get Evan Mobley or Jalen Green, or use the pick in a package for another solid star.  Also, someone give Detroit the first pick. They deserve it, and if I see KrispyFlakes go another year pissed off at the draft..."
OKC at 1 for Cade to team up with Shai and for Presti to make the next superteam in 2 years   Raptors at 2 so we can get Mobley and form a cool ass defensive front court with OG-Siakam-Mobely  Magic at 3 so they can get Jalen Green and have a legit future first option
"&gt;Fuck, Kuminga had a TS% of under .500 in the G-League   he's the youngest player in the draft by a significant margin. He's almost a full year younger than Jalen Green, so his rookie year should be compared to Jalen Green's G-League, not both of them to each other right now."
"Tankathon Sim, top 20 mock  * 1: Orlando (+2) - Cade Cunningham  * 2: OKC (+2) - Evan Mobley  * 3: Cleveland (+2) - Jalen Green  * 4: GSW (via MIN) (+2) - Jalen Suggs  * 5: OKC (via HOU) (-4) - Jon Kuminga  * 6: Detroit (-4) - Scottie Barnes  * 7: Toronto - Keon Johnson  * 8: Orlando (via CHI) - Davion Mitchell  * 9: Sacramento - Jalen Johnson  * 10: New Orleans - Moses Moody  * 11: Charlotte - Franz Wagner  * 12: San Antonio - Alperen Sengun  * 13: Indiana - Corey Kispert  * 14: GSW - Jared Butler  * 15: Washington - Josh Giddey  * 16: OKC (via BOS) - James Bouknight  * 17: Memphis - Kai Jones  * 18: Houston (via MIA) - Ziaire Williams  * 19: New York - Jaden Springer  * 20: Atlanta - Ayo Dosunmu"
Let’s hope they can trade wiseman for something serviceable or even package him and #14 to get Jalen green
"I don't blame him.  This whole one and done ""student athlete"" thing is an insult to everyone's intelligence.   Everyone knows these guys aren't there for an education. I don't understand the value in even pretending that these guys are actually getting one.  I can't wait until all the best prospects just go the Jalen Green/Jonathan Kuminga route and just go to the G-league."
"Warriors need a playmaker off the bench, a Jalen and they need to fill out the end of bench with shooters.  Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Dray/Wise/JTA/Poole/Looney should stay, thats 8/15.  For the PG spot, Steph obviously. Say we bring in a PG that runs the bench and can shoot decently, that's 9/15. A third string shooter PG to soak up minutes and shoot and nothing else makes 10/15.  For SG, Klay and Poole are locks and we can keep Lee because he's extremely close to Steph, he shoots, pretty clutch and it keeps chemistry flowing. 11/15  For SF, behind Wiggins should imo be Jalen Green. The most reasonable ways of drafting him are a) Getting the 4th pick from Minnie or b) Packaging 6th and 14th + an asset for the 4th. He fits us brilliantly and we get to get a young piece for the future while not overloading on rookies by drafting 2 rookies. 12/15 Behind Jalen Green should be Baze. He gets a lot of unfair hate as he was forced to have a massive role that he didn't sign up for after injuries ravaged us. He's hinted he wants to stay here, Steph and Dray love him and it's good for team chemistry. He shoots at a decent clip and is a great energy on defense. 13/15  For PF, we have Dray starting behind Dray would be JTA, a great gem we found who is perfect for us. I'd propose permanently shifting Looney to the bench 4. This season has showed that Looney + Dray is too weak spacing wise, they need to be apart.  For C, the starter would be Wiseman and off the bench would be Kelly Olynyk. Dude is made for us, I swear. A big man that can pass well and shoot nicely? We should really pursue him. 14/15. The final one would be some cheap C that can shoot when needed and nothing else. (If Chriss wants to re-sign with us, this would be him.) 15/15.  Put Nico on a 2 way or in the G-League, he has potential.  Overall, that's 5 new additions, no ridiculous superstar trade involved. Does this seem reasonable to you guys?"
Haha yea the Amount of Js has been a meme on the wolves sub. If we get Jalen Suggs/Green it would be hilarious.
Whoever’s left of Mobley/Green/Suggs in that order at 4  16 if Giddey is there I’d take him for sure. I also like Garuba or if Jalen Johnson settles into this range  18 whoever’s left of Garuba/Jalen/Giddy if they’re available
Not sure why you would be comparing him to top tier players when he’s 20. Doesn’t make sense.  He’s the equivalent of a top 4 pick this year. Outperformed Jalen Green head to head during his short time in the g league as well. (28 and 10 on higher efficiency)    We have 3 first round picks this year. 50% chance of one of them being in the top 4.   We can package picks and move up if we fall out the lottery.  The team is far from hopeless.
But jalen green didn’t go to college he signed a professional contract so wouldn’t he be treated like a professional player?
"Then they have to sit out a year and reenter the next draft.  But that's not anything related to Jalen Green. He signed with the G-League ""skip college"" team. He didn't sign with a NBA team or anything. So he'll enter the draft like any other normal player."
"You've got everything wrong about the draft.   You get drafted in the 1st round, you're guaranteed for two years and then 2 more years of team options. 2nd round, there's a ton of variations.   Jalen Green signed in the G-League but not with a NBA team, so he'll enter the draft like normal and whoever drafts him will have his rights just like any other player."
"This is brilliant by Presti not just bc of the obvious plethora of picks, but bc he’s on pace to do what most tanking rock bottom teams havent: limit how long they have been terrible.  Much of this is due to CP3 miraculously having OKC good last year. The other part is Shai being so good. Bc of those 2 things, it’s very possible this past year will be the only year OKC is a sub 30 win team. So you have all those picks, mortgage sale, and still field a good squad. Compare that to the process Sixers they were rock bottom for lile 5 years.   Also it helps that the league is so young and young players come in ready.   But just imagine OKC gets 2 top 5 picks. Let’s say Evan Moboey and Jalen Green.   Kemba - Shai- Jalen Green- Mobley  I mean Luka Doncic is 22 and a 2-time all first team nba guy. It’s a young man’s league it wouldn’t surprise me at all if OKC is a 35 win team"
He's a streaky shooter.  Here's my quick big board  1. Cade  2. Green  3. Suggs  4. Mobley  5. Kuminga  6. Keon Johnson  7. Scottie Barnes  8. Josh Giddey  9. Jalen Johnson  10. Alpern Sengun
"I think he's a good prospect, but a tad overrated. His ceiling is a tad bit higher than Wiseman imo.  If I was the warriors, I would take Cade, Jalen Green, and Jalen Suggs over Mobley."
"Detroit quietly had a very good draft. If they can somehow get Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, or even Cade Cunningham in this draft, they’re set up for a bright future!"
Jalen Green is gonna be one of the greatest
1. Evan Mobley Big drop off 2. Cade Cunningham 3. Jalen Suggs 4. Jalen Green 5. Jalen Suggs 6. Davion Mitchell 7. Ziare Williams 8. Josh Christopher 9. James Bouknight 10. Chris Duarte I think this draft could be very deep with good/solid players. Mobley looks like the next great big in this league I think he can be elite in 5-6 years. Cunningham will be a perennial all-star. Suggs will be a
"Who knows who might get injured. Cade Cunningham could be a bust and Mobley won't be good for years because he doesn't have his man body yet.    However, Jalen Green .....  I don't see him doing badly."
"1) Jalen Green 2) Jalen Suggs 3) Cade Cunningham 4) Johnathan Kuminga 5) Ziaire Williams 6) Evan Mobley 7) Jalen Johnson 8) Alperun Sengun 9) Josh Christopher 10) James Bouknight/Joshua Primo  I think this is a crazy deep Draft but kinda top heavy with Bust Potential. Not to say all those guys will Bust just that they could, so I'll bet on these guys."
Yeah and Jalen Green wants to live in Detroit. I’m sure these prospects aren’t just saying things to the media though.
Here's my mock draft  1-Pistons-Cade Cunningham  2-Rockets-Jalen Green  3-Cavaliers-Evan Mobley  4-Raptors-Jalen Suggs  5-Magic-Scottie Barnes  6-Thunder-James Bouknight  7-Warriors-Jonathan Kuminga  8-Magic-Moses Moody  9-Kings-Franz Wagner  10-Grizzlies-Josh Giddey  11-Hornets-Jalen Johnson  12-Spurs-Alperen Sengun  13-Pacers-Davion Mitchell  14-Warriors-Chris Duarte   15-Wizards-Trey Murphy II  16-Thunder-Isaiah Jackson  17-Pelicans-Corey Kispert  18-Thunder-Keon Johnson  19-Knicks-Usman Garuba  20-Hawks-Jared Butler  21-Knicks-Ziare Williams  22-Lakers-Ayo Dosunmu   23-Rockets-Kai Jones  24-Rockets-Jaden Springer  25-Clippers-Cam Thomas  26-Nuggets-Charles Bassey  27-Nets-Day’Ron Sharpe  28-76ers-Kessler Edwards  29-Suns-Bones Hyland  30-Jazz-JT Thor
No Jalen Green??
"A healthy Christian Wood and Jalen Green would not only make the Rockets better, but more fun to watch."
1. Jalen Green   2. Cade Cunningham   3. Jalen Suggs   4. Usman Garuba   5. Evan Mobley   6. James Bouknight   7. Alperen Sengun   8. Keon Johnson   9. Jared Butler   10. Scottie Barnes    Obviously some 2nd rounder is going to crash the party but I think all 10 of those guys are in great places to be high floor high ceiling.
Jalen Green will be the best player from this draft
"I personally think Jalen Green will be the best, but Scottie looks solid."
"No clue, so I’m just gonna throw this out. Shoutout to anyone from 2026 if you’re reading this.   1) Jalen Green  2) Cade Cunningham  3) Alperen Sengun  4) Davion Mitchell  5) Kai Jones  6) Scottie Barnes  7) Someone from the 2nd round  8) Late 1st rounder  9) Jalen Suggs  10) Undrafted player  This is super random, so I’ll be intrigued to see how this looks in 5 years."
These same reporters also put nonsense throughout the week to build up hype as a pistons fan it was a relief to finally see it after the Jalen green bs
Best player in the draft : Jalen Green  Steal : Trey Murphy  Bust: Evan Mobley or Boukknight.
1. Jalen Green 2. Jalen Suggs 3. Cade Cunningham 4. Alperen Sengun  5. Sharife Cooper 6. James Bouknight 7. Corey Kispert 8. Evan Mobley 9. Keon Johnson 10. Cameron Thomas  Not my top 10 big board. Just going based off how previous drafts have shaken up.
1.	Jalen Suggs 2.	Jalen Green 3.	Cade Cunningham 4.	Zaiare Williams 4.	Keon Johnson 5.	Moses Moody 6.	Scottie Barnes 7.	Davion Mitchell 8.	Kispert 9.	Mobely

Jalen Green is a scrub I guess lol
jalen green best player in draft
"LMFAOO. The Sixers have absolutely the most to lose here out of anyone, and this is coming from a non supporter of either team. Cleveland already have garland, sexton, okoro and one of jalen  green or Mobley and Allen if they re-sign him. Philly are looking to win now, and need to trade Simmons ASAP. Embiid’s window is slowly dying, Cleveland are in no rush"
"Jalen Green, quite easily too"
Tell me you haven’t watched Jalen Green play without telling me you haven’t watched Jalen Green play
lol at Jalen Green prediction. Nice OP
So Jalen Green is a disappointment.
How does he know hours before the draft? is it all rigged Have all the teams already picked?!?!??!?! lol Anyways happy with rockets taking jalen green.
Tilman would throw Jalen Green out of his jet in midair if he can get Cade
"ROWAN BARRETT JR   Jalen Green has stupid bunnies though, excited to see his growth."
"RJ Barrett without a doubt. If we're talking about RJ as a prospect in 2019 vs Jalen Green, then probably Green."
"Jalen Green. RJ is a great young player, but goddam if Jalen Green turns out that kid can be special. Risky? Yes. But worth it for that ceiling, RJ doesn't seem to have any elite abilities that would constitute him having superstar potential."
"RJ and Green is not the same as comparing Tony Snell and Cade. For the record, I would take Jalen Green."
Jalen Green and its not close. Green is a much better prospect
Jalen Green hasn't played a single minute in the NBA. He could definitely become better than RJ but he could as easily become a bust
"I’d personally say Jalen Green because from what I’ve seen he has a more complete game and could end up being a 1a on a team. But I’m probably biased here, since I personally would take Green over Cade"
Simmons and thybulle for Jalen Green I’m just that damn high on him future mvp
Jalen Green but RJ do b flashin doe
"Jalen would have been 2 or 3 in that draft i think. A lot would take green, unknowns can be more valuable than knowns."
"Jalen Green gonna be a star imo, so him"
Jalen Green.. by a lot.
But those Jalen Green workouts man.
I think that's the safe pick for them and rockets fans would be more than content to take jalen green
"Marv Albert: ""With the third pick in the NBA Draft, the Houston Rockets will select Jalen Green.""    ""Now they're saying it's a 2."""
Star: Jalen Green   Bust: Scottie Barnes   Steal: Trey Murphy
"Jalen Green is gonna be better, book it"
Star: Jalen Green  Bust: Wagner  Steal:Dosunmu
Shams next tweet is gonna be Houston selecting Jalen Green within the hour at this point
Jalen green?
Jalen Green will be an above average shooting guard. Nothing more.
Star: Jalen Green   Bust: Jalen Johnson   Steal: Jaden Springer
"Star: Jalen Green  Bust: Cade Cunningham  Steal: BJ Boston, Luka Garza"
"&gt;With less than 24 hours until Detroit is on the clock, the expectation here remains the same: that the Pistons end the suspense and take Cunningham. But no part of this decision process has been easy for them. There has been real disagreement within the Pistons’ braintrust surrounding which player to select, league sources say. Detroit always viewed the top pick as a three-player conversation that included Evan Mobley and Jalen Green. There’s still some uncertainty over which of Mobley and Green had more traction internally, but the strong feeling among rival teams is that Detroit has had a legitimate, prolonged decision process."
"Rockets...that one is fair, I'll give you that. But the Wolves absolutely have more talent on their roster at the moment....Towns, D-lo and Edwards vs SGA and some young, raw project players.   Difference is, as of tonight the Rockets will have Jalen Green, who combined with Christian Wood is better than SGA...the rest of the rosters are a wash, a bunch of young guys who could be good someday but aren't anything special right now."
"&gt; They are prob ecstatic with #1 or #2, so they don't need to bet the farm to trade up.  Exactly this.  No reason for us to pay a king's ransom to move up one spot when we're perfectly fine with Jalen Green. If they came down to a reasonable price for swapping picks then that's a different story, but so far it seems like they want a bundle of picks and the rights to our GM's firstborn son."
Jalen green is an mj level talent and detroit knows it
Lonnie Walker has everything that a guy like Jalen Green has. the problem is he's not as confident and he's so inconsistent and unaware at times that he looks more like JR Smith than a budding superstar.
Yeah I don't think they're passing up on Jalen Green.  You can tell Wall to just chill and be a mentor.  let the young dudes run it.
This is Jalen Green not Jalen Suggs lol
Jalen Green is really good and the top-5 prospects all would be first overall in different draft class scenarios.    Inject this chaos into my veins.
I think it’s the latter and they are just extremely high on Jalen green but I also think cade is the most likely guy to get selected  Even early in the report it says rival executives expect the pistons to stay and take cade
What about cades game has the pistons worried??   My guess is that lack of cades athleticism and one v one scoring but the dude has everything else.  Or are they just extremely high on jalen green?
"I don’t really know how massive the offer will be honestly. They can only trade down 1 spot if they want green, if we like green almost as much as Cade, I wouldn’t make a crazy offer.   I am really pumped to draft Jalen so I don’t want to trade a crazy amount to get Cade. Let the pistons make their pick and happily take the other player."
Jalen green must have proved that he was Jesus himself in that workout
"i mean, i agree, but the guy said ""anyone not named Jalen Green,"" and like... the Pistons will *probably* pick Cade, but weirder things have happened"
I’m pretty high on Kuminga. I think maybe cause he had to share the ball with Jalen Green is why his stats from the G league aren’t jumping off the page but honestly I did not watch much of the bubble to really know for sure. Either way I get Kuminga is probably not a day one contributor and maybe the Warriors would be best not drafting him. I think he’s a great pick at 7 though.
Anyone not named Jalen Green.
Jalen Green
"Yea but Jalen Green and Evan Mobley are both fantastic prospects, they’d both go #1 most years.  Cade said this draft is like 2003. There’s deadass a bunch of HOF talent at the top."
idk about all that but Jalen Green and KPJ sounds like the most fun backcourt and that's what matters
Houston rockets get on it  KPJ Jalen green Cam reddish  Pf  Christian wood  All hype beast team would be fun to see
"Alright. Let’s list a 12-man roster for each team.  Team USA starters: Curry, Kawhi, Bron, KD, AD Team USA Bench: Harden, Thompson, George, Butler, Holiday, Draymond, Lopez/Turner/Allen if we really need a big body.  Team Europe Starters: Doncic, Bogdanovic, Bogdanovic, Antetokounmpo, Gobert Team Europe Bench: Jokic, Gallinari, Porzingis, Sabonis, Vucevic, Capela, Valanciunas  Now, for team USA:  - Team USA has All NBA talent written amongst all of them. Their offense is unstoppable — everyone can iso, everyone can move off the ball, open looks everywhere, and have great ball movers.   - Also, everyone can shoot. Everyone also has IQ, on both ends. Their defense can be weak at times (when no AD can anchor the defense, but Dray at the 5 or Lopez/Turner/Allen can work okay just not great) but their guard/wing defense is also unstoppable. Kawhi/Bron IQ off the charts, and these are just from the starters.   - Everyone is good/borderline elite at on ball or off ball defense. Not a single one of these guys can be hunted on the mismatch (aside from the obvious point guard being hunted for the big man, but we have Holiday who could play for Curry if he gets hunted a lot). They can’t hunt anyone on iso’s. They can switch everyone on defense. Literally there’s nothing that this team can’t do.   On the other hand, we have Team Europe.   - Your starters have elite offense, Luka-Giannis PNR would be unstoppable (but it would kind of not work because Gobert clogs up the paint).   - Giannis is also a non-shooter, and team USA can deploy the Giannis wall to stop him. And even if he makes the right read and makes the right pass, team USA’s defensive IQ + defensive personnel is enough to either close out or rotate on the open man.  - Gobert can’t run the PNR with Luka (he can only run it with Conley) but even if he can run it he can only finish lobs, so if they deny him the lob his other option would only be to pass, since he doesn’t have a post game.   - That bench lineup is also sus, they lack a ballhandling guard (could use maybe Dragic here, but if you have at least 2 of Luka/Jokic/Giannis on the floor then playmaking wouldn’t be a real issue) OR a defensive wing (OG Anunoby could be good here).  - You also have bucket getters in both the Bogies but they’re only average on defense (including Luka as well).   - Gobert’s defense can be schemed against (see Clippers vs Jazz series) and if they replace him with someone like Jokic or Vucevic their defense will very much take a hit, the USA squad will feast on it.   - Capela is also a paint clogger, and everyone else is at most average on defense (and this is me being generous lol).   - Also, you got Porzingis, who’s a spot up shooter who can’t really bang anyone on the low post despite being a 7 ft giant lol.   (Btw, this is the best European players of 2020-2021. If you wanna replace anyone here, you could replace them with the likes of Evan Fournier, Dennis Schroder, OG Anunoby, Goran Dragic, Maxi Kleber, Jusuf Nurkic, Enes Kanter, Lauri Markkanen.)   So, after doing a bit of research, I must say that the USA team has no glaring holes in them (assuming that AD plays at the 5, otherwise their biggest hole would be center, and even then I’d say that Lopez/Turner or even Allen are serviceable enough that they can, at the very least, apply pressure and slow down anyone under the rim but not outright stop them completely). Team Europe tho, their bench is really average defensively but everyone is pretty good offensively. No one is really elite here (except for Jokic, Luka, and Giannis; although 2 of these are average at defense so they’re only elite offensively). Not to mention that there are more potential superstars in the upcoming future, this isn’t to mention Zion, Morant, Mitchell, Young, Booker, Edwards, Mobley, Cunningham, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Chet Holmgren. Heck, we could even throw someone like Mikal Bridges or Trey Murphy III, who could be very very good defensively (and offensively we only need them to knock their 3s down). Europe has maybe at most a few, and even then they’re not guaranteed to be superstars (only Luka was the most recent one).  So, as of now, and in the future, Team USA &gt; Team Europe."

"Jalen Green, Jalen Green"
"I want Jalen Green.  I think Jalen Green, but there’s a strong chance we take Mobley too"
“Jalen Green no matter what” is written somewhere in Rafael Stones office.
"What about the whole ""Pistons are very high on Jalen Green."" If anything, we go Cade&gt;Jalen&gt;Mobley. Also where did you get the idea that Weaver believes in building around big men?"
"&gt; ""oh he's just okay"" ain't gonna do it  But that's exactly what he is lol. Half this board never even heard of this guy until 2 weeks ago. He's a great player, but that's how you know this is a pretty soft draft year. Jalen Green is the only guy with real superstar potential, but is still a raw project.  Compare that to Victor Wembanyama. He's only 17 and the entire world is calling him the best prospect since Lebron. Could completely take over the NBA as the best player in the world. That's where the real hype is."
&gt; This should all but confirm that Jalen Green will be the pick at 2  Rockets trade up to #1 and select Jalen Green confirmed
Besides Jalen Green
If you look closely at the 2nd picture there is a Rockets logo on it. This should all but confirm that Jalen Green will be the pick at 2 if it wasn't obvious already.
"The hype around Edwards really wasn’t much, so it’s possible. But it’s funny how it turns out Edwards is a 20ppg scorer as an 18 y/o rookie after all that (which I doubt will be the case for any of these guys, but fingers crossed Jalen Green is as good as we all hope)"
"On my team? KPJ and Jalen Green   Other teams? Cade, Mobley, SGA, Reddish, Hunter, MPJ, Wiseman"
Jalen Green is a bonafide dog I don’t blame them
Nah def would take jalen green
"Fuck yeah, Jalen Green is going to be just as good if not better than Cade!  Mobley just doing damage control early cause he knows Houston wants Green."
"Besides my obvious interest in my own team, I'm most interested in Jalen Green. I think he's gonna be the most exciting player next year, but could also turn out not great. ROY race gonna be fun"
"KPJ, SGA, Cole Anthony, Grant Riller, Pat Will, Okoro, Kira Lewis, Poku, Jalen Green"
Jalen Green
"Assuming we take Green, our team is gonna be super entertaining this season. KPJ, Jalen Green, Jae'Sean Tate, Christian Wood, Kenyon Martin Jr, plus guys like Armoni Brooks and Khyri Thomas. That team might not make the playoffs, but they'll certainly play some entertaining basketball."
Imagine those two with Jalen Green. That would’ve been a nice young core.
Imagine those two with Jalen Green. That would’ve been a nice young core.
"I really like Jalen Green and think he definitely has top scoring potential, but is anyone else worried that his handles aren’t so tight? From what I’ve seen he doesn’t have the best handles and in the NBA that can really limit your scoring ability."
"everyone thinks they deserve to get drafted higher than they do, why u surprised  even jalen green talked bout how if he played college he'd be the #1 pick. they dont settle for top 5"
Fine most of us are on the Jalen Green train anyway
You're dissapointed with a 20 year old averaging 17/6 and whos shown a great awareness of the floor despite only playing half of an NBA season?  I for one am very happy with KPJ and I feel he will develop into a great 2nd star  Also why is everyone acting like we think KPJ is gonna be the franchise cornerstone lol. Thats obviously gonna be Jalen Green or Evan Mobley
Cause of wood and Jalen green  Not shocked he doesn’t wanna go to Houston when wood just broke out
Houston Rockets Camp has 'A level of interest' in Jalen Green
"Cade is not gonna bust but I’m just saying there’s def a valid argument that Jalen green has a higher ceiling than Cade. People talk about cade like he’s guaranteed to be a star point foward like luka, lebron etc. obviously no one expects him to hit that level but that’s what people say is his mold. He could just be a solid all star wing player which is great still but I think he’s being overhyped."
"If they take Jalen Green, I don't think they will massively regret it because I see them as pretty close prospects with an edge to Green.  Some noteworthy things about Cade:  1. He only averaged 3.5 assists in college playing 36 mpg. He averaged more turnovers than assists at 4.0. Should his team take the blame for it? Maybe.  2. He's not an elite athlete at really anything. He doesn't have the deceleration of Harden, the quickness of Trae Young, the pure speed of De'Aaron Fox, the leaping ability of LeBron, the strength of Luka. He's just a good athlete, not a great one. Not a deal breaker at all but worth noting.  Don't get me wrong, he's an excellent prospect and is deserving of a no.1  pick, I'm just not convinced he's as far ahead of the pack as it seems."
Not if they pick Jalen green
You’re damn right Jalen Green looks good.      Seems like he’s pretty good at the whole basketball thing too.
"This guy played in the g league (same with Jalen Green)  He’s battle tested, played against grown men. He’s gonna be really good"
After the season Jalen Green put up in the G league it makes no sense for Emoni to go to college.
"Did you not see this guy in the G League?  Literally a generational scorer.  2 Guard is loaded in the bottom 5 teams between Sexton, SGA and Jalen Green"
You expect Jalen Green to rival 50/40/80 efficiency as a guard?
"PG: Cade; SG: Jalen Green; SF: Jerami Grant, PF: Christian Wood; C: Evan Mobley.  I’d rather get Mobley than SGA.  The drop off from SGA to Jalen Green in terms of offensive production isn’t going to be much, but the increase from Carter to Mobley is probably huge."
Probably Jalen Green.
Morey: Add Jalen Green and your next 7 years of draft picks pls.
John Wall is just old Jalen Green dw
nah bruh we good lol but if y’all don’t want Jalen Green holla
They have Jalen green
"Zion, Cade,melo, jalen green,Tatum, and Trae"
We got Jalen Green not Cade Cunningham...lol
Jalen Green baby!!
It's better to be a player fan because:  1. I'm not from the US.  2. Players move from team to team all the time  3. I don't want to support a big market team like the Lakers or Heat that get mercenaries every season  4. I don't want to support a non-big market team either because I have no affiliation to that area and they find it hard to attract FAs and therefore compete like big-market teams can  5. I am a Jalen Green fan because I'm from the Philippines and I like how he plays
"I wouldn’t say worse in the west, but bottom 3 feels pretty likely. Depends on if OKC actively tanks, Jalen green lives up to the hype, if the timberwolves can ever stay healthy, and pelicans have to be good with Zion eventually righf? It’s possible"

Jalen green fam gonna take it home
"Yea it’s time the Spurs look for a cornerstone player. All their division rivals already have one: (Zion, Luka, Morant, Jalen Green)"
"Honestly some of us hope so, I can't speak for all spurs fans but every other team in our division has had a bad year and got a top pick (Luka, zion, Morant, Jalen green). Id really be fine with tanking this year if it meant us getting a super high draft pick next year."
"I don’t take summer league too seriously but Jalen Green looked like he really benefitted from being in the GLeague. He had some foul draws you don’t usually see from college guys, had some good dribbling moves keeping guys on his back or at off angles, just some moves I don’t expect some other rookies to do."
We’ll see how much further Jalen Green takes HOU after y’all wasted Hardens prime
Cade is 6’6.. Summer league updates him 6’6 now  Cade is same height as Jalen Green
"Although I am a Detroit Native, I really enjoyed seeing Jalen Green and Suggs play. Green vs Cade might actually be a great watch tomorrow night as well. I think Cade and Mobley will be a threat in the future tho. The Cavs and Pistons might be finally building towards a great future. I wish Detroit would've drafted Green tho"
Jalen Green ROTY
Jalen Green was pretty decent
Wtf you mean so 😂 dude had an entire full year at 18 to train with a pro staff as well as play against pro players. Also you’re comparing Nico Mannion to Jalen Green who are two very different players.
It’s not comparable as nico mannion played college ball. Jalen Green went directly into the g-league from High school. Dude had no prep against dudes like him. Straight to pros.
"While I think jalen green will be a star, I don’t agree with this argument. Nico mannion was also dropping 19 and 7 in the g league as a 19 year old. I very much doubt Nico mannion will be the best player in his draft. The things that I’d take away is his feel for the game and athleticism, not his stats"
"Tomorrow night is the Pistons vs. the Rockets. Rockets had the 2nd overall pick and the Pistons had the 1st, that would be a good one to check out for sure. If you do, look out for Cade Cunningham and Jalen Green to ball out."
I think Jalen Green is gonna be the best player from this draft. Dude was playing against pros in the g-league at 18 and dropping 17 a night.
"Hopefully not Jalen green. He plays so aesthetically smooth, I hope he translates even better into the league"
"no hate to him at all, but I want to see Carmelo try to guard a young buck like Jalen Green 1-on-1."
Jalen Green is a more skilled and athletic LaVine who is 5 years ahead in development   It took LaVine 5 years to reach 20ppg and 6 to reach 25ppg  I’m thinking it will be rookie/soph for Green to accomplish that.
yeah I believe it but does that make Jalen green a legit 6’6? because by the same measurements green was 6’6 and Sengun was 6’9
"jalen green is an elite scorer and that's it. his playmaking and defence aren't developed at this point. cade has the playmaking, defence and scoring, plus elite leadership. cade is just more well rounded and that's why he was the consensus number 1 pick. summer league performances don't mean shit, especially since these guys are dealing with nerves and rust at the same time."
"&gt;All the players you mentioned are special in either a quick release or good handles and speed.  The thing is how often does that 1"" really matter? It comes into play sure, but over other factors - it's not nearly important.  When you're a special player, it doesn't matter.  That's what I'm saying here. For an athlete like Jalen Green who has got incredible hang time and floats on finishes, fadeaways, etc. then that 1"" difference doesn't mean anything when compared to a player 1"" taller and can't do the same."
Pick the Rockets...Jalen Green is going to be something else
And Ignite made the playoffs as the 8th seed and lost to the 1st seed Toronto team. And oh yeah Jalen Green dropped 30 in that playoffs game against the team that won it all.
It's probably because he was advertised as a 6'8 guard coming into the draft and that gave him the edge over Jalen Green but because he looked a bit slow last night people are bringing it up
"I think people really underrated Jalen Green and Jalen Suggs because they were next to Cade and Mobley. Even though both were top 5 picks in comparison to Cade and Mobley they were placed into the ""just categories"":  ""Oh just a scorer.""   ""Oh just a defender.""   ""Oh just a \_\_\_\_.""     Nah, they're ""Just stars."" if you ask me. The same with Scottie Barnes, I thought that guy played great during FIBA but he was placed outside the main 4 and was being overlooked."
"Coming from a warriors fan, I actually don’t think JP will end the season on a most improved player bc everybody saw how good he was at the end of last season. BUT, honestly I think he has a good shot at winning 6MOTY. Your also kind of sleeping on the bucks. I know they sort of got off easy from injuries on other teams but the Middleton and Giannis duo is pretty unstoppable when they are both on their game. I think the bucks could make it to the ECF. Jalen Green could also come away with ROTY but it’s pretty deep draft class with lots of talent so who knows."
"I'll say this, it's a great sign that top 15 picks picks perform well during Summer League. Lebron, KD, Kobe, Dwyane Wade, Harden, Curry, Kawhi, etc. all showed out during Summer League. Jalen Green looks to be in good company.  However, it's not a bad sign when a top pick doesn't perform well during Summer League either."
So is Jalen Green a Hall of Famer or not?
Sad to say for pistons fans but I’d imagine 95% of ppl here taking Jalen Green number 1 without question
Is Jalen Green the next Von Wafer?
"Smh, we should redo the draft. I want Jalen green"
They definitely don’t for the G League. But if you want to think Jalen Green plays at 6’8” (lol) on the court be my guest
"It’s not a part of the trade package, but the trade package was still the biggest haul of picks in NBA history and if we had taken Ben and whatever shit picks Philly was offering in the late first round, we would have had a 0% chance of getting Jalen Green, so I think it’s fair to say we got Jalen Green as a direct result of taking the BKN package. I do agree that it’s not really accurate to lump him in as part of the package."
"Yeah there’s nothing to be ashamed of if you are going to be a more efficient Evan Turner. That’s still a fringe-All Star level player.  Is that what you fully expecting out of a franchise cornerstone #1 pick though? Probably not. I mean you’ll take it over having him turn out to be Anthony Bennett but it’s not ideal if you are DET.  Make no mistake that Cade was still a bonafide Top 5 player in the draft…I just didn’t feel like he was the de facto #1 overall that everyone pegged him as. Evan Mobley will probably lead the league in blocked shots in a couple of years and Jalen Green already looks like he has the athletic prowess to create his own offense whenever he needs it.  Just watch the highlights of both Green/Cade in their first summer league game and you can see the stark difference in quickness, lateral agility, and ability to create in isolation. Doesn’t necessarily mean Cade won’t have a better career as Green still has many weaknesses (poor shot selection and overall strength) but Cade’s ceiling as a cornerstone franchise superstar is definitely much lower than the two players picked behind him."
"This might be the first season where height inflation gets magnified.  Jalen Green played in the g-league, and his height measurement was 6'6, which should be without shoes since g-league follows the NBA's corrected no-shoe measuring system. Cade measured at 6'6 in college. Both guys measured at 6'6 in the summer league roster.  Looking at the draft photo, [they are practically the same height](https://imgur.com/ReOIdAV). There's no way Cade is 2 inches taller than Green."
"Jalen Green measured in at 6’6” as well, and there’s a pic from draft night of them shaking hands and they’re standing eye to eye."
He looks smaller than jalen green..
"I don’t think Cade busts but I was always wary of his “ceiling” because he’s simply just not as athletic as people were saying. His first step is average at best and his lateral quickness leaves a lot to be desired.   Is he going to be a productive and good player? Absolutely. No doubt about that. But is he going to 100% be better than the elite-ultra athletes like Jalen Green and Evan Mobley? I don’t know. Those guys are top percentile even though they may not have their total offensive arsenal figured out yet.  Honestly, Cade’s physical package kind of reminds of Evan Turner. Good enough to be in the NBA but not enough to “game changing”."

"Get out of here haha Jaylen Brown would manhandle Jalen Green like the little boy he still is. Browns strength, handle, and footwork are on a deferent level than Green’s at the moment. They are comparable athletes and shooters. JB was just an all star lmao."
But then they don't get Jalen Green who's going to be their franchise cornerstone...  Think.
"houston fans wylin fr, and that’s coming from a Jalen Green enjoyer"
Yeah but right now Jaylen Brown and Brandon Ingram are better than Jalen Green. It’s all about how much he is willing to work on his game. No doubt he could be a very very very good NBA player if he puts in the necessary work.
No comparison is the best comparison. Personally haven’t seen an athlete like Jalen Green. Maybe he reminds me of a smaller less strong Jaylen Brown but Green is already significantly better than Brown was at this age.
I take off my rosy glasses and say Jalen green looked good
"anyone else really annoyed by the announcers? i had to put it on mute at some point and put music on because i couldnt stand that guy who kept hyping up Jalen Green and Evan Mobley. It was just way too blatant. There was one play i remember where Sengun made a great play on Mobely defensively, it looked impressive but the guy almost seemed disappointed like he only wanted to watch Mobley. Then once Sengun was putting up better numbers he was like this guy came out of nowhere nobody knows who he is. Come on wasnt he like the 16th pick? He also kept saying Green is going to average 30 ppg some day. I was like come on its just so blatant. I liked watching the prospects but this guy just seemed overly hyped in an annoying way."
"If Stewart wasn’t here I think Cade would’ve had a better game all around. I also think he looked a little gassed later on in game but I’ve also been told it’s his first time playing 5v5 since his last college game.  Cook really couldn’t catch passes and it blows.  I’m not bothered by him being 6’6, I never bought the 6’8 height cause he didn’t look it to me. He’s still got over a 7ft wingspan and the 6’8 height was apparently with shoes.   Jalen Green did exactly as I expected. Love that for him and he’s gonna be an offensive stud."
"I'd say out of this draft class, Jalen Green for pure athleticism reasons."
"NBA has plays and more skilled players to expose a player like Carsen Edwards. In Summer League, you aren’t going to see a player like Jalen Green call for an iso if he’s matched up to a player like Edwards. So Edwards would get a lot more room to play since he isn’t being exposed as much"
I didn't compare Jalen Green to Mitchell. I said someone ELSE may surprise us and pull a Donovan Mitchell. Read the comment properly bud
"Jalen Green is a walking bucket  3 level scorer who is highly athletic, can shoot, pass, and isn’t awful on D( definitely can improve)  Dude was a godsend to us man I’m so excited"
"I feel you. I don't hate the Rockets, I think some people are taking my original post too far. I just said when you see stuff like that, it makes it hard to root for you as a bystander. Just me personally, I always try to be a good representative of my fanbase. I understand that if I act like an ass, people are going to think that Hawks fans are dicks. I understand that every fanbase has assholes, but when I see multiple fans of a team being dicks en masse it does affect my view of that team. I'm not condemning all Rockets fans by any means though. I just think it's stupid to overreact off of one summer league game and I wish people wouldn't be assholes...   All that being said, I think Jalen Green is a bucket and Sengun already looks like a 6 year NBA vet. Y'all killed it in the draft."
Haha he owned you bud. Jalen Green a beast
G league offers scholarships as well. I heard about it when I was watching jalen green videos before the draft
sidenote though: jalen green is a baaad mf man! also tbh i think he has more defensive potential than he's being credited for
Senegun &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jalen Green
"How can you possibly believe that the rockets with Ben Simmons are bad enough to still get the number 2 pick and draft Jalen Green? Bringing Ben Simmons on makes us a 30-40 win team for the next 5 years, persistently running on the treadwheel of mediocrity and never accomplishing anything. If you really believe that Ben Simmons and his contract are better than 7 straight years of pick control over an aging team, then I’m very glad you aren’t my team’s GM."
Nope. Bust. Jalen Green MVP. Sengun ROTY. No recency bias.
I think Jalen Green got 500k for one year in the g league. You don’t pass up that type of money
"It's better if you want to impress Summer League reactionaries lol.   Jalen Johnson hadn't played a game since February and dropped 20/10 and was as impressive as Green/Kuminga, what's the spin for that?  As far as LaMelo, I think if Edwards played on a team as good as Charlotte/wasn't forced to be the #1 option with DLo and KAT out, he wouldve had a very comparable rookie year to LaMelo.   As far as Wiseman, he didn't even play college ball, so ofc he was gonna be behind."
They got Jalen Green because they tanked. Could’ve cut Harden for nothing and still gotten Green. None of the players that they got are worth shit at this point or even apart of HOU’s plans. Those 4 first round picks are all gonna be 24-30 with how good BKN and MIL are. Houston won’t use any of those swaps except for maybe 2027. Quality of assets is much more important than quantity in the NBA
"I think the Pistons should run with Killian, Cade, Bey, Grant and Stewart as their starting 5 with Cade bringing the ball up and initiating offense and Killian being the secondary ball handler. So Cade can face bigger/slower players. It’s really disappointing to see he’s slower than I expected and apparently the same height as Jalen Green."
Jalen green is officially the GOAT
"I mean, we can make it easy on you guys in a few years. You can keep Sengun and we'll take Jalen Green?"
"It’s just for fun tbh. I rooted against Curry and Giannis and Westbrook when we had Harden because I wanted him to win MVP and they were his competition. I don’t actually dislike any of them, but I enjoy comparing them to Harden. Same with Jalen Green and these rookies"
"Jalen Green is special regardless of G-League or NCAA imo. The verdict is still out on Kuminga, Todd and Nix."
"Jalen Green is the best scorer from this draft, I can see him very well winning ROY.  JGup, Green, Wall and Kpj on a team gonna be lots of fire highlights throughout this next season."
"Nothing beats good ‘ol rookie hype. Jalen Green is the next MJ/Kobe player, guaranteed."
"Hit the brakes, dude. I love me some Jalen Green, but it's one summer league game."
"There's an army of us, and we are utterly, delusionally insane and devoted to the divine gift to basketball that is Jalen Green."
Jalen Green. Save my comment
jalen green for sure. dude is a future superstar
Jalen Green looked like a star. Bouknight also looked really good and Sengun did too
Jalen Green? Probably a better choice for PG
No Jalen Green?
Put Jalen Green in the starting SG spot you coward
Jalen Irish Spring Green
Jalen Green obvi
Jalen Green looked amazing
"Lol it's just fresh in my mind, you feel me? If a couple Hawks fans went into a Rockets game thread and were throwing out ""Jalen Green is overrated"" takes for 2 hours, you'd probably have a similar reaction I'd imagine."
Jalen Green
they lied about his height... he's nowhere close to being a 6'8 pg  meanwhile Jalen Green was listed at 6'4 before being drafted but he looks like a 6'6 or 6'7.
Jalen Green duh
"Summer league doesn’t mean shit. Trae played terribly. Bums like Anthony Murrow lit it up in summer league.  One of the top 3 picks busting is very very likely, but too early to say who it is so no need for the bust talk.  Cades stat line could easily have been 12/6/9/2/2. Lot of his teammates couldn’t hit easy looks or had concrete hands.  Missing shots doesn’t really bother me, what bothered me is that I thought he was 6’8, he looks the same size as Jalen Green. His handle is kinda loose, and he looked slower than I anticipated.  The Luka comparisons he drew are not valid, that will not be how Cade develops or plays. The slow guard can and has worked, but Cade will be Cade, not anyone else. He’s gonna have to become a unique type of player to be a star.  Personally just as optimistic about him as draft night, this game changes nothing. Makes me interested in a few things about him, but my belief in his talent is still the same. I will withhold true judgement of what he is until I see him play ~20 regular season games."
Mark my words. Jalen Green is/will be the best player from this draft.
Cause Jalen Green exists
"&gt;He looked 6’6 on the court  This is meaningless. You can't see exact height from watching video of a game. Lol.  &gt;was measured as 6’6  Was **listed** at 6'6, when we know teams list inaccurate heights. Some teams use w/out shoes and some list with. He could be 6'6.4 without shoes and 6'8 with, while Jalen Green is 6'6 with shoes.   &gt;and looked like relatively the same height next to another 6’6 guy.   Yeah, ""relatively"" doesn't mean much when we are discussing a couple inches.   I have no idea what his actual height is, but it's perfectly fair to say we don't actually know and none of this proves much."
He looked really small tho.. jalen green looks bigger than him
Jalen Green is much more fluid than Wiggins.  Wiggins was always robotic and power athleticism while a jalen is graceful and slithery  Also love the username - I get it
"I wanted Jalen green so badly for this reason exactly. Only time will tell if I was an idiot or not, and I understood why we took cade, I just wanted Green so badly."
"I might be overreacting, but goddamn does he look bigger and more aggressive already. He shot well tonight and wasn't too bad playing as a lead guard for a while, and his defense was really good as usual (despite Jalen Green just being built different lol)"
"They are both crazy athletic, strong jumper. Outside of that I don’t really understand the comparisons either. I feel like Lavine likes to play much more downhill while Green likes to go a little more lateral. I also feel like Jalen Green is just way ahead of where Lavine was at this age"
Cade debut was kinda underwhelming especially after i just watched Jalen green
Why not keep him and have jalen green learn from him?  That would be one hell of an entertaining back court to watch especially if Jalen performs every night like he did tonight?  Wall throwing green oops what’s not to love?
Isnt usman a complete project and mostly just defense right now? I know he has no 3 pt shot right now and I haven’t heard much about his offensive game  Honestly I think the rockets draft has gotten way overhyped. Jalen green is a stud but I don’t get the hype on these other guys they took.
"I wanted to the magic to get Jalen Green terribly, dude is a pure bucket. Will avg 25-30 for his career."
Harden..KPJ..Jalen Green
Jalen Green moonwalking all season confirmed
he looks nice out there.  i dont know why anyone would be down on him aside from the fact that jalen green looked like a monster earlier
"Ive followed Green since HS, so im obviously high on him. I watched some Cade college highlights, I guess scouts saw a mini Luka in Cade or something but Jalen is clearly the star of this draft."
Jalen Green
Look I’m the biggest Pistons and Cade fan but even I know we made a mistake and should’ve traded the better player Jalen Green!!
"I know this is just a sample size, but i can't fathom why Jalen Green fell below Cade in the draft."
Cade is nice but he isn't a Jalen Green
"Cause they are hacking the shit out of him lol  Same with Jalen Green, the Pistond take the 10 personal foul limit waaay too serious"
"Yup, Cade's leadership was showing through the Wired segments of the game. I hope we get some Wired segments for Jalen Green too, but I think he might not be the same vocal type of player like Cade is."
I came here to say that I'm so happy the pistons chose Cade Cunningham instead of Jalen Green
"haha yeah, and redninetyfour is a clown he literally criticised danuel house yesterday for not giving his #4 to jalen green but when house responsed, redninetyfour decided to lick house's ass:  https://twitter.com/RedNinetyFour/status/1424855575003901952  literally never seen someone backtrack that much in my life"
"Jalen ""Michael Jordan"" Green*"
"Gotta go with my man Stone... In less than one year, the Rockets went from Harden/Westbrook/Covington led team to a young core of:  Christian Wood Kevin Porter Jr.  Jalen Green  Kenyon Martin Jr. Jae'sean Tate Alperen Sengun Usman Garuba Joshua Christopher  And a crapload of future 1st round picks/swaps."
Jalen Green
Way better than jalen green and it’s not close
dude what? jalen green has outplayed cade cunningham so far in the summer league
"No, Christian Wood is the perfect age for where he can be a part of the youth movement while being a bonafide leader/1st option.   He’ll be 26 in September and will be entering/in his prime by the time guys like Jalen Green/Kevin Porter Jr. truly break out. He’s awesome value at around $13 million a year."
"u clearly didn't read properly, i said i think jalen green will be great IN THE FUTURE. he's not great yet, he's just a rookie playing in summer league"
"this is r/nba, fans will give their opinions on teams and players that's the whole point. and yes i do believe jalen green will be great in the future, and sengun will be a serviceable role player imo"
"i've been watching jalen green since he was in high school and watched sengun play in turkey even before they were rockets. so no, i'm not basing my analysis of 2 summer league games"
Jalen Green &amp; Kobe Bryant   &amp;nbsp;  They're the same picture
Jalen green is the best rookie of all time and it’s not close
Jalen Green being his sidekick with Garuba the 3 and D third option.
Wait so does Jalen Green have an entire 12 inches of ankle???
I thought you were saying all of these were Jalen green for a second and almost had a stroke
"He's making my countrymen proud. Jordan Clarkson is still loved, but Jalen Green is on another level."
Pretty neat how #1 and #2 played how they were projected.  Cade being the overall guy and Jalen being the bucketeer.  Wish nothing but luck to both players but more luck for Jalen Green let’s fucking go Rockets gg
Scoring guards always get this stereotype. Jalen Green actually knows which shots to take.
I hope ESPN asks Jalen Green again about what he thinks of being drafted #2 and if he thinks he should've gone #1. Grade A stuff.
does it at least help prove the point that “cade not being on the same level as jalen green” is just not true?
Jalen Green took it personal
"Bro I. Don't. Give. A fuck. You know what, fine bro, Jalen Green is gonna go on to be the greatest basketball player of all time. He's gonna go on to win 25 championships and 20 MVPs and Cade is gonna be playing in Australia in 5 years. Is that what you wanted to hear? So pathetic bro, why TF you care so much about what a random stranger on the internet thinks of your 19 year old kid in comparison to another 19 year old kid?"
rockets mightve had the best draft ..you dont let them get jay gup and jalen green then alpen lmao great core
"The Rockets have Jasean Tate, Jalen Green, and a Jalen Tate lol"
Jalen Green
Jalen Green is built like Kobe.
$300 on Jalen Green Rookie of the Year let's go!!
Jalen Green is a great interview.
"Jalen Green failed to prove he should be the No.1 pick, it's Alperen Sengun."
Jalen Green DID say he would ball out against Detroit for passing up on him - he's a man of his word
"Redraft goes Jalen Green 1, Suggs 2 imo"
&gt; Jalen Green tonight: Jalen Green  Who is he on other nights?
ROTY Jalen Green
"Jalen ""James Harden"" Green"
Jalen Green
I will wear a Jalen Green jersey in my grave.
Jalen Green was named Jalen Green tonight
John Wall - KPJ - Jalen Green - KJ Martin/Sengun - Wood  Maybe something like this would be the starting five.
Jalen Green is very good at basketball
"I know ya'll are comparing Jalen v Cade, but do you guys not see who Cade is working with? Green has legitimate guys around him, Cade dropped 20 with the rest of his team being pretty terrible"
Jalen Green
"I honestly think you can make Jalen Green a heliocentric guy.  The shooting, height and playmaking are there."
so with john wall in houston is jalen green gonna come off the bench to start the season ?
Jalen Green outplayed Cade on everything   My goodness
I think Jalen green might be my favorite player once Curry hangs them up
The finishing touches on a magnificent performance. Jalen Green better 😤😤
Jalen Green is NICE
Jalen green is so wet
jalen green throws some absolutely stupid passes
"I would love if you are right, but Jalen Green is a guy I want to have the ball.  No way KJP is taking less than 24 shots a game."
So John Wall comes off the bench?  I just think KPJ is redundant with Jalen Green.  I’m almost certain they will look to move him.
"jalen green will win ROY, and teammate alpine shotgun will finish second in votes."
Well Jalen Green is the only top lottery pick on the Rockets so idek wym
Jalen Green is relentless at attacking the paint
Pistons giving Jalen Green way too much attention when Sengun and Christopher been their undoing all game.
Jalen Green &gt;&gt;&gt;
I don't know if John Wall makes the cut when I insist that Khyri Thomas and Jalen Green start.
Jalen Green playing with a chip on his shoulder against Cade rn
"jalen ""steph curry"" green"
"Fair enough, I don’t think his athleticism is bad. He’s certainly no keon Johnson or Jalen green but it’s more than passable, mainly due to his size, nba ready frame and strength. Hoping he does well but only time will tell"
Looked so slow and unathletic on that crossover on Jalen green there
"Sheesh, Jalen Green is NOT a good defender..."
Jalen Green playmaking been pretty nice
"Honestly, in terms of height Green and Cunningham are way too close for it to matter especially when you consider the bounce Jalen has.  Biggest disparity is the difference in weight if anything."
Jalen Green is a bonafide scrub.
"Rockets really got  Sengun, Josh Christopher, Usman Garuba and some guy named Jalen Green"
the NBA draft was apparently  1. Cade Cunningham 2. Jalen Green  2.5. Josh Christopher
"Is Jalen Green actually 6'4"""
Yup. If y'all haven't heard awhile ago. Its over. Jalen Green is a bonafide scrub.   Cade Cunningham's legacy is GOATED
Cade just cooked Jalen Green 👀
Jordan Clarksons ceiling is Jalen Green
Just when I thought Jalen Green's career was over he does that. Green is MJ and Cade is Sam Bowie confirmed folks.
Micheal Jordan stays awake at night praying to be half as good as jalen green
Jalen Green is rich mans Michael Jordan
Jalen “James Harden” Green
Cade lowkey clamping Jalen Green. Hate to see it.
I need jalen green in this jersey
"I've worked hard to adopt deranged takes based on literally one missed shot, and damnit I'm gonna post them.  JALEN green IS a BUST. I was here EARLY for Luka Goatza!"
Jalen Green scoring all his points from free throws. Truly a rockets legend.
Jalen Green already getting superstar calls smh
"Jalen Green is really good at getting to the line. He’s gonna be a perennial 23+ppg player, barring injuries."
Took you this long to come to that conclusion?   Jalen green has been a bust since Cade hit that 3 over him.
Is it just me or does Jalen Green have some long ass legs?
Yep. This settles it. I've seen enough. Jalen Green is a bust.   Cade Cunningham is the GOAT.
oof jalen green is getting hounded
After 4 minutes I can safely say Jalen Green is a bum that will never make it in this league
jalen green 3 TO hardenesque
I knew tonight was gonna be the Sengun game  Jalen Green may have a slow start
"It's rough because I really liked Jalen Green in the last game and I thought he looked really promising, but the results are in and I am forced to say he is a bust and Cade is next GOAT. I don't like it, but by now it's indisputable"
Jalen Green is a bust. It's over.
my take is that jalen green and evan mobley will both be better nba players than cunningham and im sticking to it
"Man they got us playing Cleveland, Detroit, Toronto and Orlando. NBA wanted to create a menace out of Jalen Green lmfao"
"After buying a Westbrook jersey then almost getting a Wall jersey, I’m finally confident that Jalen Green is gonna be the next one."
Where will you be when Jalen Green saves the NBA?
Jalen Green is a bonafide star in the way he plays and act and he knows how to talk to be heard. People are just eating this shit up lol.
"Yeah but then you can't have arguments about them with your friends.  ""Dude, I love Kawhi! He's so dominant!“  ""Yeah man""  .  .  .   ""Dude Jalen Green is so good""  ""Whatever man, he's such a POS""  ""cuz he dunked on your ass!?""  “He's trash bro!"""
Jalen green was never mocked over cade from what I remember. Cade was damn near 100% picked at one on everyone's board for almost 3 years now
Jalen Green is for real
Jalen green impressive as hell
Jalen Green honestly hasn't been one of the guys who constantly gets spammed from what I see  It's mainly Scottie and Giddey
I've seen like 30 Jalen Green posts in the last week
lets gooo jalen green
Jalen green is nice
"Kevin Porter Jr was saying he was 6-6 because he's taller than Jalen Green 6-9 with the hair  In reality, Green is 6-3, he's 6-4"
"Where will you be when Jalen Green saves basketball, and thus, the world?"
"In my opinion, Mobley was the number one pick. He was putting up numbers similar to AD. Cade is more Khris Middleton than Luka Doncic in my opinion.   Jalen Green is good but he doesn't have the playmaking to be the number one offensive star. None of the draft picks do but Mobley can definitely be the number one defensive star for a team."
jalen green has more points than lemickey rn 🥸
Jalen green? Dude looks fantastic so far!
"I'm gonna go Jalen Green. But like the Redditor I am, I also haven't watched a single minute of his play."
definitely jalen green with kpj as his point guard lmao
Damn should have taken Jalen green /s
How tf you gonna evaluate a prospect based on highlights. Lemme guess you had jalen green 1 last year and gonna have jaden hardy 1 this year
Scruuuub confirmed. + Jalen green  Give Barnes roty  We have seen enough!
Jalen Green ain’t a bust
JALEN GREEN EFFICIENT GAME  KPJ LOW TURNOVERS SENGUN DO WHAT YOU ALWAYS DO
Jalen Green not Suggs lol
"Jalen Green has missed his last 12 3s, rookies are rookies"
Rockets suck. Jalen green is still super raw and my hype for him has gone down considerably.   It’s gonna be a several year rebuild
Jalen Green gonna either be the next Michael Jordan or the next Swaggy P. Im so excited to find out lmaoo
What's wild to me is he probably CAN beat by everyone but really speedy guards. Dude outran jalen green like it's nothing. I refuse to believe he can't beat a PF on a switch
"yeah but you can't teach that kind of explosiveness and athleticism. I agree.i think KPJ is more of a SG, but you guys are at the stage where you are just developing young talent. if KPJ turns into a 18 ppg microwave type guy like Jordan Clarkson, and Jalen Green can work on his shot selection and start scoring at the level hes capable of, with Woof &amp; Sengun, i would take that core as a top 10 young core in the league. I also like Garuba and Josh Christopher"
Don’t forget Jalen “Micheal Jordan” Green
"There were definitely people saying he *might* be the best prospect, but Cade Cunningham and Jalen Green were more polished players and have greater offensive potential. Plus Mobley is underweight for a center and needs to do a lot of bulking up."
"Your team's problem is you will have to pay kevin porter and Jalen green one day. Both of them do the same thing. Jaylen brown is a capable defender though. You would still have cap space to sign a max contract for 2 more years. Now you got a core of Jalen green, Brown and Christian wood plus a  max level player.   The Celtics now got cap space again to do Celtic rental like signings they love to do since John wall contract finishes."
Nope because Jalen Green is gonna be the best player in the draft.
Jalen Green is next
if they take jalen green then no
SGA.   Jalen green better than Case any way.
Jalen Green isn't at no Tigers games lol. We are picking Cade Woj is just click baiting.
"I know people are penciling Cade in as the de facto #1 but am I alone in not being  super impressed with him? I get it. He’s versatile, good size for the position, can pass, and seems to be a good character guy. But to me he doesn’t seem to do anything GREAT and it’s scary to have a player that seems like a Jack-of-all trades as your franchise cornerstone.  His game reminds me a lot of Lamar Odom which is a good and bad thing depending on how you look at it.  Jalen Green on the other hand is a bonafide elite athlete and scorer. You know pretty much what you’re going to get from him and his potential career path. Even Evan Mobley is a foundational defensive big with the ability to stretch the floor. To me these are better building blocks for a franchise as you have a concrete plan on how to develop and build around them."
jalen green or zion williamson
"Hoping Jalen Green pulls a Lampe and falls to the Bulla at 38.  Edit: Apparently Giannis’s brother that plays like he’s Michael Jordan is in the draft, so I hope we take him."
Yeah people should consider that Jalen Green shot 36% in the g league.
"What if theyre actually talking about trading for Jalen Green and Cade is a #2 pick.     Maybe that perceived lack of athleticism is causing him to drop, much like Green's is jumping him up that draft board."
"Breaking News! Rockets trade 2nd pick to the Piston's for their top pick to draft...Jalen Green! Rockets tossing in a couple of jalapenos, Eric Gordon, the late 1st round pick, Olynk and some chik-fil-a sauce. Not sure if its Polynesian sauce or straight up Chik-fil-a sauce, but word has it the Pistons were planning on taking Cunningham with the first pick so the Rockets felt the urgency to trade up for Green and get him while he was still on the board. /s  FML as a Rockets fan this year."
Are we sure about that if they trade down? Jalen Green and Evan Mobley are going to be great players too.
"I'd say it depends on the return you get in a trade.  And you should feel happy about whomever you select, both Cade and Jalen Green are going to be great pros. Mobley too for that matter.  Mike Schmitz, who is ESPN's draft guy and a really good analyst IMO said that there are 3 #1 picks in this draft."
"kevin love, rubio, oubre, jalen green"
"I'm not even sure what day Jalen Green worked out for us, because there was no public appearance or sighting of him downtown like with Cade. Cade's workout wasn't confirmed until after a picture of him with some fans outside of Comerica Park was going around Twitter and Reddit, and shortly after a team beat writer confirmed he had his workout with the team earlier that day, and would be attending the game with Troy Weaver, Coach Casey and Saddiq Bey, among others on the staff. If Coach Casey and Troy Weaver would have as much as taken Jalen Green out to dinner, we would have known, someone would have posted it."
Soon to be Jalen Green
"&gt;Do you think Bouknight and Jalen Green are also the lowest archetype of prospect?   I think Bouknight is, I think Green has legitimate playmaking and defensive upside.   I also didn't say archetype of prospect, I said archetype of star, meaning if Cam hits his top 20% outcome it's worse than pretty much any other archetype hitting their top 20% outcome.   &gt;its easier to learn how to be a good defender  Not from where Thomas is. It's unlikely he ever becomes even a neutral defender. Most players in his mold never do, and he's worse than most of those."
"Jalen Green it is, like 99% sure"
Lets go jalen green FMVP in 2023.
Soon to be Rockets legend Jalen Green.  Pistons need to back off.
Great news for us that Jalen Green looks pretty good.
I love Jalen Green too
"Yeah, but Jalen Green came out and said he’s only working out for Detroit and Houston  I think that kinda showed that he was a lock for top 2."
Jalen Green either be Zach Lavine or Dahntay Jones
"From an ceiling perspective, Jalen Green projects as a potential top 15 player while people see Cade as a potential top 5 player, which is basically the difference between being a #1 option on a championship team or an elite #2 option (think Kawhi vs PG)"
"&gt;You joke but this is word for word exactly what the geniuses at r/Rockets concluded in this same thread on that sub  It's not exactly wrong though.  Cade is the consensus no.1 and Jalen Green is still reportedly fighting to get the 1st pick spot and will be working out with Detroit.  Draft workouts have a serious impact on a team's decision, and Mobley was slated as the 2nd pick for a while before Green's stock shot up. Mobley should at least go for a workout."
Jalen Green is who they're picking.
Some of the Nets picks are like 4 and 5 years in the future when their super team will be no more. Those will be extremely valuable.  Not to mention we’re a rebuilding team and we have all of our own picks available to trade that will be for sure lottery picks for the next couple years at *minimum*.  And if it requires what you pistons fans think it requires to move up **one single spot** then I’d say fuck no give me Jalen Green.
"Michigan would be good:  **Starters**: Monte Morris - Devin Booker - Miles Bridges - Draymond Green - Javale McGee  **Bench:** Bryn Forbes, Edmond Sumner, Denzel Valentine, Josh Jackson  **Coach:** Magic Johnson  **Cheerleader:** Jalen Rose  **Water boy:** Kyle Kuzma"
"4 years from now 12 man roster could realistically be any combination of:  PG: Cade Cunningham, Ja Morant, De’Aron Fox, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young SG: Brad Beal, Jaylen Brown, Jalen Green, Devin Booker SF: Jayson Tatum, Brandon Ingram,  PF: Bam Adebayo, Zion Williamson C: Evan Mobley, Anthony Davis, DeAndre Ayton  That is an absolutely stacked, deep talent pool. There was an unprecedented number of injuries and players sitting out this time around, but the USA talent pool is so incredibly deep."
Jalen Green is set to become the first number 2 pick that had a grandparent spend some time in the Philippines.
Locked in to Jalen Green huh
"Yeah, I guess there's 2 ways of interpreting this:  1. Mobley/Suggs really don't want to play for Tilman 2. Mobley/Suggs have intel that the Rockets have made up their minds on Jalen Green and it's a waste of time to work out for them  I'm not sold on #1. The team picking next is the fucking Cavs, lol.   So I'm guessing it's more of #2."
"Emoni, Chet, Jalen Duren/Green all gotta be on the team fs"
I wish we could be stuck with Jalen Green.
Jalen Green was promised the Rockets pick a  long time ago
"oh no i guess theyll be stuck with jalen green, woe is them"
"If you want to build a sense of identity with a team you should choose either the closest one to you or a young rebuilding team. Some good options for this are the Thunder, Pistons, Rockets, or Magic. The thunder have a historic amount of draft picks in the upcoming years,and already have some lovable young players in SGA, Dort, and Poku. On top of that they are set to have a very exciting draft next week. The pistons are a team primed to turn it around soon with the likely first pick Cade Cunningham. The Rockets also have quite a bit of draft capital, but less young lovable players as the thunder. Jalen Green should be a blast to watch for them though. Finally, the Magic have two top 10 picks this year and a slew of young players themselves. You can’t go wrong with any option.  Alternatively, if you want to watch good basketball without rooting for the favorites, the Celtics, Nuggets, and Suns are all teams with good cores that should compete for the next few years.   If you want to watch a young team play good basketball, but don’t want to sit through a rebuild, try the Hawks, Grizzlies, or Pelicans. All three have recently drafted stars who aren’t in their prime yet.  If you want to watch chaos and a full rebuild then become a trailblazers fan. They will likely be blowing it up this off-season or next. If you only want misery then go with the Sonics. Sonics fans are perpetually miserable and the only thing they have to do is root for the thunder to lose.  Finally, some people choose to just root for a certain player. If you find a certain player that you love, you might just choose to follow them wherever they go."
"Exactly. I'm hearing the same thing from Cavs media right now in regards to Jalen Green vs Evan Mobley. If the team believes both have similar outcomes then the guy they need is a long-term center (pretend J Allen doesn't exist).  But if they believe Jalen Green is significantly better, then fuck it, get him and figure it out (as they are rumoured to be doing by trying to trade Sexton)"
Why do raptor fans always have to force the raptors into every thread?  Thread on Jalen green… *don’t forget Barnes!*
"Thank you for asking!  (in no particular order)  PG - Curry, Simmons, Fox, Killian Hayes, Rubio  SG - Kelly Oubre, Jalen Green, Lavine, Booker, Oladipo  SF - Tatum, Giannis, Aaron Gordon, Abdul Nader, Hayward  PF - Kuzma, Kevin Love, Hachimura, Ibaka, Obi Toppin  C - Nerlens Noel, Robert Williams III, Rudy Gobert, Daniel Gafford, Jarrett Allen"
Jalen Green
Josh Giddy or Jalen Green. Cade ain't sniffing top 5 in voting  You heard it here first.
Jalen green
How would the All Green Lineup do?  Jalen Green  Gerald Green  Danny Green  Jeff Green  Draymond Green
Jalen Green…To the Moon! 🚀
Jalen green
https://www.gettyimages.ca/detail/news-photo/jalen-green-and-cade-cunningham-shake-hands-after-being-news-photo/1331396485  They look the same height to me. Cade is closer to the camera too
"Kd is not even the only example; there westbrook, Zion, kemba, Paul George and others. As it stands, Cade is definitely not the same height as jalen green and the difference is visible on the court"
He has Jalen Green lol. We had Brodric Thomas running the point and Isaac Okoro being put at PG for stretches
he’s definitely not the same height as jalen green bud
"I mean its hyperbole but I'd be disappointed if Jalen Green didn't average 27+ for at least like 5 seasons. His game is so similar to Devin Booker, Zach Lavine, and Bradley Beal. Just unreal shotmaking."
How about Jalen Green for Embiid
jalen green
"It all depends on wtf Fertitta plans to do with the Rockets.  I could totally just see him saying fuck it, and feeding the ball to Jalen Green while sitting Wall/Gordon, and basically turning it into a 3 man team with Christian Wood and Kevin Porter Jr and an island of misfit toys around them.   Meanwhile the Pistons have a pretty promising young core/starting lineup, and guys like Jerami Grant that'll take up a lot of scoring and shots.     IMO Cade will have the better year from an eye-test standpoint, but Jalen Green will have the stats advantage."
and he had way better guards around him  jalen green for one lmfao
"I know! That killed me. But still, Jalen Green is a bucket."
I'm with this pic. Jalen Green.
Jalen Green
Jalen Green. Will average 20 and he'll be a highlight reel which will feed the narrative.
Jalen Green
"Jalen Green. Was my pick before the draft and I remain unchanged.   Dude is a walking highlight reel. Not to mention he’s got a green light on a bad team, going to average a solid 20PPG"
Jalen Green no bias
Jalen green no questions man averaged 18ppg in the gleague
"Huh, my memory must’ve been pretty faulty, I swear Jalen Green was all anyone talked about when it came to future stars."
Pistons were strongly considering taking Jalen Green
"That's a big part of Jalen Green on the court. Dude is not going for sportsmanship awards out there.   [https://youtu.be/XT7TWYxu1vU?t=463](https://youtu.be/XT7TWYxu1vU?t=463) (timestamped but you can watch the whole thing)  It's funny when an announcer might say ""Look at that smile!""  Like nah man, that's Jalen Green talking a bunch of shit and laughing at the other team."
Jalen green is must see tv to me
dude is 6’6 w/o shoes just like jalen green stop over analyzing it
Jalen Green: a human highlight reel AND soundbite-creating machine
They should allow each player to carry a weapon of their choice as well. How epic would it be to watch Jalen Green slash Cade with a katana.
The Pistons drafted Darko and now they passed on Jalen Green.  Green is going to be even better than advertised.  He is possessed to score and dominate he himself will be a big brand.  Cade can play. Jalen is on some Kobe stuff though.
I'm just pumped for all the reddit posts comparing Jalen Green and Cade Cunningham's height tonight
"Detroit vs Houston, you'll get to see Cade Cunningham vs Jalen Green."
Jalen Green
Cade ‘bout to fade. The reign of Jalen Green is on the horizon.
I'm not saying Cade aint good. But I'm team Jalen Green all day.
"If we even sniff the NBA finals, Jalen Green is likely a future GOAT. So fuck yeah"
Jalen green 50 bomb incoming
"this is an aspect of trades people never talk about.  the rockets mightve been able to get simmons/young players for Harden, but would they have gotten 4-8 years of cheap, team-controlled Jalen Green?  probably not."
Jalen Green is Michael Jordan with a hint of Wilt chamberlain
We don’t get Jalen green if we take that deal so I’m pretty happy with the move we made
Jalen Green is another younger prospect this year.  Chet Holmgren is only 2.5 months younger and next year's big named guard Jaden Ivey is only 4 days younger.
Jalen Green the GOAT
Kyle Kuzma (Lakers = spotlights = flashy = shallow)  Dominique Wilkins (Hawks =fly=good at dunking)  Jimmy Butler (Heat. Nuff said)  Giannis (Bucks. I imagine deers running fast. If Giannis was in the Bulls it be more accurate)  Kevin Garnett (Wolves. Tenacious. Ferocious.)  Chris Bosh (my dude looks like a dinosaur)  Jalen Green (Rockets. He's gonna soar high to the moon Istg)  Westbrook (Thunder. Thunderous slam)
"He will obviously be very good but I don't see him changing any franchise . Jalen Green is just exciting af , never seen a such a refined offensive skillset from a rookie . He will score 30,40 in the biggest games like the superstars ."
