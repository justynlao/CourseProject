i heard jordan bell is a f.a yall need another center after all lol
"Just to add this, the on off stats are poor when comparing two players from two different teams. It is very contextual. For example a player could be the heart and soul of a team but the team could also have a capable backup center and maybe a Barea type backup point so the second unit offense runs well. At the same time you could be a good but not great type like a Clint Capela but because your backup is like an Isaac Hartenstein type your on off numbers are stilted. Much like this, maybe the starting five works well and has great players and your center Jordan Bell is playing with those Curry and Thompson and looking good in the advanced stats but your David West type solid backup is all of a sudden surrounded by Damion Lee and Quincy Cook types"
"looney is legit fine though, it's not egregious like Jordan Bell who basically has no NBA skill that isn't jumping high"
can you BELIEVE???? they got JORDAN BELL with the 38th pick???? WHAT IS THE LEAGUE DOING allowing these GOLDEN THIEVES to snatch such a PLAYER?
"Oh man, this is not worse than the g-league squad we were rolling out last year.  Napier, Okogie, Kelan Martin, Treveon Graham, Jordan Bell, Culver, McLaughlin, Bates-Diop  I’ve definitely enjoyed watching Beasley, DLO, Vando, and Mcdaniels"
The Raptors should seriously consider signing him as a backup big.  Jordan Bell and Chris Boucher formed one of the more dominant front courts in recent NCAA history as their games complement each other so well.  If Boucher hadn’t gotten hurt that Oregon team would have been the NCAA champs that year.  As a 2nd unit they could provide that complementary game again.  Also the Raptors desperately need another big.
"There were only five picks between 2012 and 2019, one of which was Looney (Looney, McCaw, Jones, Bell, Evans). You going to blame the Spurs for taking Livio Jean-Charles, Deshaun Thomas, Cory Jefferson, Jordan McRae, Kyle Anderson, Cady Lalanne, and Nikola Milutinov between 2013 to 2015? No, because criticizing teams for only occasionally getting quality NBA players out of late firsts and seconds is stupid."
"Ive got 7 pages to go of players, but heres how divisions are shaking out:       \*\*The Kitchen\*\*  Dwayne Bacon  Jordan Bone  Quinn Cook  Seth/Steph Curry       \*\*dopplenamers\*\*  LaMelo/Lonzo Ball  Jordan Bell  Rudy Gay  Kyle Guy       \*\*Scenic\*\*  Mikal/Miles Bridges  Dillon Brooks  Trent Forrest  Dearon Fox            \*\*Festive\*\*  Aaron/Jrue/Justin Holiday  Darius Garland"
"Balls, glen rice, Jordan Bell, Kemba Walker, Desmond bane"
"&gt; Raul Neto, Isaac Bonga, Anthony Gill, Robin Lopez, Cassius Winston, Garrison Matthews, Jerome Robinson, Jordan Bell, or Alex Len  oh my fucking god"
Did you see his teammates?? The starting lineup was Raul Neto Beal Isaac Bonga Jordan Bell and Robin Lopez... who else is supposed to fucking shoot lmao
"We missing like 6 key guys lol ... Beal was playing with a bunch of bad players who shot worse than him.   Like do you want Raul Neto, Isaac Bonga, Anthony Gill, Robin Lopez, Cassius Winston, Garrison Matthews, Jerome Robinson, Jordan Bell, or Alex Len taking those shots instead?  Neto, Lopez, and Matthews are probably the only players there that may get playing time if the team is healthy."
why didn't he pass to *checks his notes* *Jordan Bell*? or huh...*Isaac Bonga*?
"Every undersized big we draft is “the next Draymond.” See: Jordan Bell lol. I’m glad Paschall got the chance to find his game early. He looks like a phenomenal scorer. If he learns anything from Dray (besides the yelling lol), I hope it’s how to defend guys bigger than him, cause he feasts on centers on offense."
LeBron gets away with shit.  One time he basically did a judo throw to hurl Jordan Bell to the ground and the foul got called on Bell.
Man how is an NBA team starting Jordan Bell in 2021 lol
"Jordan Bell doesn't currently have an NBA contract, right?"
"And the Rockets trading him away for nearly nothing always puzzled me.  The Rockets got:  * Robert Covington, 6.5 ppg, and no longer on the team.  * Jordan Bell, 3.0 ppg, deep bench player, not on team.  * And a 2024 second round draft pick from GSW."
Wizards just signed Jordan Bell
"&gt; Kevon Looney  What excuse do you think he needs? He's a solid role player.  Having said that, if you think he needs an excuse for not being a superstar you don't know his injury history.  &gt; Damion Jones  Again with the injury history.  &gt; Patrick McCaw, Jordan Bell  Attitude.  &gt; Jacob Evans  Not a lot of potential?  But NONE of these players are lottery picks. So way to miss the point?"
"???? Why would you randomly bring up damion lee when there are so many other players from the warriors who have never really worked out? You act like GSW can develop everyone.   “These guys are only busting because the players suck.” So what’s the excuse for Kevon Looney, Damian Jones, Patrick McCaw, Jacob Evans, and Jordan Bell? All draft picks for the Warriors that never amounted to anything."
"Here’s the inverse of that, Jordan Bell was so bad last year that we traded him, and he’s no longer in the NBA."
"Exactly.  I also didn't include guys like Jeremy Lin, Seth Curry, Bazemore and Justin Holiday as they really didn't get much playing time with us.  We would also have to look at guys who didn't pan out such as James Michael McAdoo, Jordan Bell and Festus Ezili.  I really think Javale is the best example.  Player who wasn't doing well, came here and got some big contracts after he left.  I love Javale, btw!"
Alex Len and Jordan Bell are our last hope to fade for Cade
Room Service Legend Jordan Bell  Lakers legend Jordan Bell
I also remember the hype injured Boucher got for being even better than Jordan Bell. That was an understatement.
"Laker legend, jordan bell."
"&gt; I mean, Jordan Bell also had Draymond as a tutor  he's also not a second round pick  I believe Wiseman will improve, he's only 19"
"I mean, Jordan Bell also had Draymond as a tutor. And I remember how high people were on him, at least in the beginning.   To be fair to Wiseman though, he already seems leaps and bounds better and just seems way more serious about learning and working on his game. And like, I gotta keep reminding myself, dude is only 19. Like holy shit I was a complete ding dong at 19 and Wiseman seems way more poised."
"I think the responses to this game are a bit over the top. If Colin Sexton doesn’t have the best 10 minutes of his career the nets likely win this game.   And Kyrie didn’t take that many bad shots, he was just missing them. The guy had a rough night (still put up 30). That’s not gonna happen every time. He was missing wide open threes.  It also looked like Kyrie and harden tried a bit on defense towards the end and harden was grabbing offensive boards. They’ll need wayyy more of that going forward but it was a good sign.  They need to sign a wing defender (Andre Roberson?) and a center who can play passable defense. Deandre Jordan might be the worst starting center in the league. He’s just awful on defense and his offense is contingent on lobs from the point guard. Unbelievable that they killed all of their remaining cap space last summer signing him to placate Durant and Kyrie. I think Jordan bell is available but they could maybe steal a center from another team for some scrub and a couple 2nd rounders. They could also consider trading Dinwiddie but I think that should be the last option since they’d get a terrible return offer"
Yeah. They need to figure out some defense. Andre Roberson is a free agent. So is Jordan Bell. They can also trade Dinwiddie who I like a lot but if they wanna win now that’s the move.
"Also it's not like his college career was shabby by any means. That U of O Ducks team that made it to the Final Four and lost to eventual champs North Carolina by a point had a helluva squad. If Boucher wasn't injured I'm pretty confident they would've made it to the championship game at least. That team also had Jordan Bell (who sadly flamed out after that 1st chip got to his head), Dillon Brooks, and the Celtic's favorite rookie Payton Pritchard.  They weren't bad the previous year either, losing to Oklahoma in the Elite Eight when Buddy Hield looked like the second coming of Steph Curry.  Those were the best Ducks basketball squads in recent history."
Jordan Bell will totally be that good someday....
"Memes aside, it did look like he was ready to finally take a step forward after that stint in Memphis. But looks like he ended up just reverting again. He got traded to Houston for another disappointing player in Jordan Bell and then waived"
Cash considerations still circulating in the league and Jordan Bell is out of it.
"&gt; Quinn cook, Nick Young, Patrick McCaw, Jordan Bell averaged 14-22 minutes per game while their minutes in the playoffs dropped to &lt;10 minutes.   Quinn Cook shot 44% from 3, on over 3 attempts per ( in just 33 games, by the way, so you're being a little disingenuous there ).  He wasn't exactly killing their offensive rating.  Young shot 38% on 4.  And it's not like they were blowing every team out -- they lost 24 games and had a net rating of +6, which was 3rd-best that season.  &gt; If you look at the playoff stats, the GSW were 1st in both oRTG and dRTG.    &gt;   &gt;\[and\]   &gt;   &gt;The Lakers last year lost their first game against the Blazers and Rockets  Those Blazers and Rockets won nearly as many games as those Warriors' first two playoff opponents -- despite the season being 10 games shorter.  The 2018 Warriors played the least-impressive slate of playoff opponents in history, and I don't believe there's a team within even shouting distance of them.  The only even good team they played took them to seven, despite being pretty flawed to start, and injured.  &gt;To put it into perspective as successful as MJ teams have been, he has only swept teams in BO7 3 times.    On the other hand, Magic Johnson was involved in winning 5 4-0 sweeps, in just 12 seasons.  As did Kobe Bryant, in more seasons.  James, for the record, has a ridiculous 12 four-game sweeps to his credit so far."
"I would say when bringing up stats you chose the regular season, which can be kind of taken a bit out of context for example: Quinn cook, Nick Young, Patrick McCaw, Jordan Bell averaged 14-22 minutes per game while their minutes in the playoffs dropped to &lt;10 minutes.  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA\_2018.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2018.html)  If you look at the playoff stats, the GSW were 1st in both oRTG and dRTG.  &amp;#x200B;  and idk, 4 - 0 sweeps are pretty rare these days and not sure if they should be the best measurement of success.  The Lakers last year lost their first game against the Blazers and Rockets and nearly lost two in a row to the nuggets if not for a buzzer beater, but you knew in a BO7 the Lakers had nearly full victory.  Even the fact that they won 4 - 2 against the heat, we kind of knew it wasn't really that competitive at all and all about closing it out.  To put it into perspective as successful as MJ teams have been, he has only swept teams in BO7 3 times. (Small info disclaimer, in the old BO5 system he has swept them most but not all times but obviously winning 3 is lot easier than winning 4)"
"Hmm... they have 3 open roster slots afaik. They need depht at Center and good defense. Some free agents that could be useful:   Jordan Bell  DeMarre Carroll (played with Harden before)  Anthony Tolliver  Rondae Hollis-Jefferson  Andre Roberson  Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  Especially the last two could be interesting, both can't score (Nets don't need scoring) but are amazing defenders and are not too old."
"All those hopeful Blazers fans in the comments, super unlucky to break your knee and get clowned on by CJ.   Warriors might want to get Jordan Bell if that COVID roster expansion happens. Wiseman/Paschall/Looney might not be enough if they get quarantined."
Something tells me ol Liberty would stunt on Jordan Bell
&gt;	DBOY  Has to compete with Jordan Bell
"He was also shitting on Kerr for playing Kevon Looney over Jordan Bell.  But personally, I like guys who actually go out on limbs. More entertaining."
"Warriors did the same thing with Jordan Bell. Over the cap, most you can offer is 2 years."
I remember having this angry protracted argument with a dubs fan who insisted that he wanted jordan bell more than tatum.
"Fast breaks, with the ball being moved around a lot, and players giving up good shots for great shots. One example of this is a warriors play where Klay is in the corner, kind of open, catches a pass from draymond, pump fakes, swings it to curry, who immediately swings it to Durant, who drives, then kicks it back out to curry, who takes two dribbles towards the basket, then throws a no look pass back to draymond, who taps it up to Jordan bell for the alley pop dunk (tried to paste it form YouTube but it didn’t work) those are the plays I love to see"
"They didnt have the roster space for Boucher, they handed out too may guaranteed deals and couldnt move away from Damian Jones or Jordan Bell fast enough. They gambled that teams would still be hesitant about his knee injury  For Nunn, he didnt want to wait a year and then play behind Steph, Klay, and(at the time) Andre. Miami offered him a deal and a big role right after training camp"
Maybe draymond + Curry give them positive reinforcement? Draymond gets the reputation of being scary but if you’ve seen the clip where Jordan bell messes up but draymond talks to him and tells him everyone makes mistakes - Bell finishes an alley oop the very next play
"What a roller coaster jordan bell was. he started off pretty decently for us, is he even still in the league?"
"Honestly though, before he got injured Boucher was looking better than Jordan Bell at Oregon."
"If you told me then that Boucher would be the brightest light outta him, Jordan Bell, Pat McCaw and Damian Jones, I would have looked at you like you were  shirtless and horned in the Capitol building"
"A guy made a post about it in the warriors sub and the post reminded me of how Jordan Bell and Zaza would pass it back to him and set the screen, simple enough but effective  god oubre what are you doing"
Aaron Gordon Justise Winslow Jordan Bell
Like he is an above average in ball defender (giving effort sadly qualifies as above average) the only reason they attacked him (and Jordan Bell) was because the other guys were A+ defenders and curry is like a B defender. (Bell managed to hold harden to 16% from 3 but 55% overall likely because he was the solo big when playing so if he was on harden there was no one to protect the rim if he was beaten)
Bell.  Jordan Bell.
"I mean, even Jordan Bell knew what to do when Steph was trying to relocate. Feels like they don't even practice this play with how confused Oubre always looks."
Jordan Bell was supposed to be Draymond 2.0
If you'd asked Warriors fans a couple years ago they would have told you Jordan Bell.
Like what exactly? I'd argue that in the last 3 drafts the only time we didn't get the BPA was Semi Ojeleye over Jordan Bell.
"&gt;NBA analyst Raja Bell says that Steph Curry cannot be compared to neither LeBron James and nor can Michael Jordan be compared to him.  Really strong writing to open this thesportsrush dot com article.   The whole thing reads like it's been run back and forth in Google translate a few times:  &gt;Steph, however, he is in a loaded Western Conference as opposed to the much weaker 2018 Eastern Conference."
We thought Jordan Bell was gonna be the second coming of Draymond. There were even people saying we should trade Draymond to save on cap space after Bell had a couple of average at best games during WCF.
Dude peaked the season after the championship tho. Can't believe you just compared a guy who was the 2nd option on a championship and all nba to Jordan bell. Regardless of how shit he's been
Post championship hype is real. We were hyping up Jordan Bell after 2018 chip
Just like Jordan Bell.
Jordan bell was getting 17 minutes a night in a championship playoff run. He started a few games and gave us important minutes. Lay off of him
no offense to jordan bell but james wiseman and jordan bell are not in the same league. It's alot easier to teach a talented player that is a sponge then someone with an iq of 60
We were saying the same thing about Jordan Bell a couple years back.
Didn't Jordan Bell get suspended for that?
Jordan Bell?
"We had a good bench of vets and youngins for 2017 and 2018, 2019 is when things went to shit.   Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston, Javale McGee, David West, Ian Clark, Patrick McCaw, Looney.  Ian left after 2017.  Nick Young joined in 2018  David West retired after 2018,   Javale left after 2018  McCaw left after 2018.  Nick Young went after 2018.  Also, Zaza went, that's our entire bench minus Iggy and Livingston who were getting older  We were then left with Iggy, Livingston, Looney, Jonas, Cook and Jordan Bell.   What a fall from grace from our bench. From one of the best and smartest benches to absolute shit."
"Your last couple sentences reminds me of Jordan Bell. He's very athletic but then bad work ethic. Like he wasn't some star at Oregon (hence why he was a 2nd rounder) but he still got to NBA (as to say his athleticism got him thru hs and then college). However, we then soon learned that he skipped practice and then people began questioning his work ethic. Fast forward almost 3 yrs, he's out of the League (or rather, not playing on an NBA team)"
Jordan Bell school of disappointing Warriors projects
"He has some flashy dunks and displays of athleticism, but other than that, I don't really recall him ever looking great. He's always been someone who frustrated the hell out of Ron Adams, who couldn't curb his fouling after years of working with him. (His real world IQ seems a lot higher than his BBIQ, with an engineering degree from Vandy)  Are you sure you aren't getting him confused with Jordan Bell? (who looked pretty good at times, especially that 2018 Houston series)"
"Bro stop changing the subject you said “Its that the game was TIED after the first half even though Steph had 0 and Harden/CP3 were both going off.  Because the Curry has always had the most help.” A lot of help in guys out or barely in the league in Alfonzo Mckinnie, Bogut, Jordan Bell, Livingston, Damian Jones, Jerebko, etc LOL"
"Lol. Guys like Austin Rivers have already said on record that the 2019 Rockets on paper was better than the 2019 warriors without KD. A lot of guys like quinn Cool, Livingston, Jordan Bell, Bogut, etc arnt even in the league anymore"
"??... Since 2010... Wiseman, Paschall, Bell, Looney, Barnes, Draymond, Klay... Even Jordan Poole has been solid."
Damian Jones and Jordan Bell have started too.
Jordan bell for the guitar hero game
Now we just need Jacob Evans and Jordan Bell to get cut then the Warriors can re-sign their core of the future!  Edit: it has come to my attention that neither are currently employed
"That was more a ""they can't keep getting away with this!!"" meme for the KD Warriors than it was about Cousins.   Remember people also acted like the Warriors were getting peak Dennis Rodman when they traded for the right to draft Jordan Bell.  And regardless, people hadn't seen post-injury Cousins at that time. They have now (and he's suffered yet another major injury between then and now)."
"Jordan bell had his jersey untucked. He just got subbed in and you need to be ready when you enter the court, and have your jersey tucked. Its a delay of game. Minnesota already had one delay of game, the second is a technical."
"When I think of Chris Boucher, I cry.  A team with Payton Pritchard, Jordan Bell, Dillon Brooks, Tyler Dorsey and him would have won the national championship."
"I'm not sure at all Boogie is currently better than Devontae Cacok their 2 way player or than a journeyman like Jordan Bell.  Like trust me I don't like to say that, because it's sad, but just like Blake Griffin, I just don't see how he helps a team, unless he randomly shoots 40% from 3 for the rest of the year"
I am a ducks fan. I went to a CAL vs Oregon basketball in Berkeley. Jordan Bell (rookie or second year with the warriors) walks in 10 minutes into the game. Sits down with dark sunglasses and giant headphones. 2 kids around 10 years old dressed in Oregon and Warriors gear walk up to him during a timeout and ask for his autograph. He ignores them for like 30 seconds the  whispers into his friends ear. The friend then tells the kids that Jordan isn’t signing autographs tonight. Didn’t make me feel so highly of Jordan Bell.
It's Jordan bell
Jordan Bell feeds the hairless
"Jordan Bell is now on the Erie BayHawks, soo..... good joke Jordan"
"Of course I hardly watched his games with the Warriors and other teams he’s been on. He’s on 1/30 teams and I’m not a Jordan Bell super fan.                                  Which is pretty much my point. There’s nothing special from an NBA perspective about him. There never was to begin with. You guys would have seen this potential in anyone. He had the greatest spacing of all time and the luxury of playing up 30 against 2nd teams.                                                             You got him for 3.5 mill which was dumb of the Bulls even in Hindsight. Everything worked out perfectly for you guys. All the fucking time. With Jordan Bell, the playoffs, Curry’s development, everything.                                                                 You have to expect things like Kevin Durant getting injured to happen eventually. They happen to all teams and more often than they happen to the Warriors. Jordan Bell falling short is one of hundreds of players that falls short"
Whoever the fuck u of a is catching strays. Jordan bell went to u of o
&gt; Jordan Bell reached onto his plate and proceeded to rest a handful of spaghetti on my cousin's bald head  So mean! Gonna be burning [his jersey](https://i.imgur.com/XBVfIgi.jpg)... Been a fan of his since Game 7 of the 2001 ECF 😕
Sure but op saying Klay “gets away with stuff” when Jordan bell was the one who was doing all the bullshit in this particular instance
That’s just what Jordan bell said so he wouldn’t get in trouble lol Klay literally said he had nothing to do with it
"Also, yeah you can do it to rookie Jordan Bell, but the coaches should be exempt from shit like this lmao"
"My very ill cousin was granted a dinner with the Warriors through the Make-A-Wish Foundation. At dinner, it was clear that other people in the restaurant were staring at him, and he apologized to the players that attended for the distraction. Without saying a word, Jordan Bell reached onto his plate and proceeded to rest a handful of spaghetti on my cousin's bald head."
This is how it works though   Jordan Bell can’t get away with it because he’s Jordan Bell.   But Klay can because he’s Klay Thompson ...  Young players get hazed all the time but vets don’t. All about who you are and perspective.
"Crucial:  &gt;“It got bad man. So they got CCTV footage because Mike’s like ‘I’m not paying for this, there’s no chance in hell.’ So they get the CCTV footage, and you see Jordan Bell walking in there. And Jordan Bell’s like ‘Nah it wasn’t me,’ and they’re like ‘We have you on camera’ and he’s like ‘Oh yeah it was, but I was just playing a prank.’  lmaoooooo he really pulled the ""jokes on them I was just kidding"" card"
Just how big of an idiot is Jordan Bell
Was he responsible for Jordan Bell and Damion Jones?
Fill out that lineup with Bill Walker and Jordan Bell and have them all play for the Bulls
The reverse Jordan Bell
"&gt;Yes he does. You do not let Dame shoot. Ever. Same as with Steph  I don't get what you mean by this. Obviously both shoot plenty of times per game. Teams don't intentionally leave them open, but that's true for plenty of other players too. That isn't really what people are talking about.   In most of his possessions Curry runs laps around screens off ball to create openings for himself and his teammates. Curry has a quicker release than Lillard and is much more comfortable taking shots without much separation (Lillard has said this himself). This makes it much more difficult for defenses to stay on him through screens, and frequently results in teams overcommitting to him and leaving the second man open for a run to the basket.   This is the main thing people are referring to when they talk about Steph's gravity. We have several extremely high efficiency drives and 3s that are generated every game by players overcomitting to Steph, primarily on off ball screens.   You can see this in the TS% of our role players, here's the TS% this year vs last year for a lot of our guys that don't create their own shots.     Player | 2021 | 2020 ---|---|---- Mulder | 68% | 53% Looney | 66% | 40% Lee | 64% | 55% Bazemore | 64% | 53% JTA | 64% | 53% Poole | 60% | 45%  These guys take almost exclusively uncontested 3s and uncontested or lightly contested drives.   This has been a pretty consistent trend over the Warriors' run with Steph Curry. We've had guys like Jordan Bell, Damion Jones, and the 37 year old ghost of David West average over 60% TS for a season next to Steph.   When people talk about Steph's gravity the main thing they mean is that his assist total does not remotely reflect the amount that he improves his teammates shot quality."
"I didn't say traded.  I was saying they gave up their depth - which is exactly what they did.  There's a reason Jordan Bell and Alonzo McKinnie got playing time in the playoffs - both are bottom of the bench level guys, but the Warriors had their starters and then a pretty hard drop off."
"No but statistically speaking, second rounders who are drafted after multiple years in college probably have a 2%? Chance of being in the nba at 30. It’s just the reality. For every Draymond and Brogdon, there’s 25+ guys who don’t make it past a couple years. I’m a warriors fan, I can name many late picks such as  Damion Jones, Jordan Bell, Jacob Evans, Jordan Poole, Patty Mccaw in which we’ve hyped up over the years just to filter out of the league in 2 more years.  Where do you see Paschall playing at age 30? Does he ever become a spot up 4 like a Gallinari, Tobias, Barnes level? Does he become an impact defender, someone like Jaymichael Green, Crowder etc as an undersized 4? Does he become an elite offensive player who sucks at defense like Harrell, Holmes etc? Where’s the fit in today’s nba? Because believe me what he does now, the classic iso in the second unit, where he sucks at defense and spot up shooting won’t last in the nba in another season or two. Turnover is high in the nba if you don’t have a specialized skill"
"kinda curious why you say Paschall might be out of the league in 5 years and what you mean by Jordan Bell hype? he was lightweight in the ROY conversation last year, and he's only in his second year. up until he got hurt was pretty reliable off the bench, which kind of makes sense when he went against actual starters last year vs role players now. he doesn't have much shot from 3, but his midrange is not bad and dude's fairly strong."
"JTA is actually pretty good and Mulder isn’t bad agreed. I don’t think Paschall is even in the league in 5 years. He’s undersized, can’t shoot well, not great basketball IQ, I don’t see how he contributes to winning basketball and he reminds me of the Jordan bell hype. Damien Lee is an ok 10th man but nothing else. He’s not good for a 6-7th man"
"The guy became the youngest Warrior to ever score 25+ points in a game (at 3/3 shooting from 3 as a 19 year old center who only played 3 games in college), yet people in this thread are talking about him like he's Jordan Bell lol"
Warrios shouldve kept him. I liked him better than Jordan Bell when they were drafted.
Jordan Bell just needed to box out :(
"It's crazy to me as an Oregon fan that on a team that featured Jordan Bell, Dillon Brooks, and Payton Pritchard, Chris Boucher has been the one making the biggest impact in the NBA."
World Champion Jordan Bell for Cash Considerations.
Everyone? Jordan Bell was acting like GSW got a god during his first season.
"Jordan"" 5x5"" Bell"
"Jordan ""Fuck LeBron"" Bell"
And signing Jordan Bell. Just swapping bums at this point
"Seriously, Jordan Bell had a ""great"" attitude to fucking up apparently in that he never cared to stop doing it."
You think those guys have careers on most other teams? You think guys like Jordan bell and james micheal macadoo would be good on other teams? Theres no real evidence to suggest kerr cant develop talent. They have never had any high level prospects. Wiggins and wiseman are the most notable. And wiggins is playing a lot better in GSW
"Tell that to Jacob Evans, Damion Jones, Patrick McCaw and Jordan Bell who all did not develop well on a contending team full of veterans. Being a rookie on a contending team is not really the ideal situation for development"
Search Chris Paul Jordan Bell. It was less than 18 months ago
"Klay was drafted in 2011, Lacob &amp; Co bought the team in 2010  As for role players, we got Paschall and Poole in the 2nd round who are already contributing in their sophomore years. Drafted Ezeli who was solid before his injury in 2012. Jury is still out on Nico Mannion &amp; Justinian Jessup but they both show promise as well. And even some the players that didnt work out like Jordan Bell, McCaw, and Damian Jones still showed flashes of being a solid NBA player which may not seem like much but many players picked in their range dont even see the court let alone contribute a solid 10-15 minutes  Besides why are you acting like its some sort of failure of the Warriors FO for not hitting on every late draft pick? Picking past the high lottery its a crapshoot and most picks dont end up panning out, so the Warriors draft haul under Lacob has actually been pretty good."
"What if I told you that the value you can get in a trade with another team is also dependent on where the pick is in the draft, so the exact same problem applies?  Not only that, but we actually did trade some of them for a guy who you may have heard of named Andre Iguodala. Which is why it was only 4 picks in the dynasty years 2013-2018 instead of the 12 you normally get, none of which were higher then 28th overall and we did hit on one of those in Kevon Looney (Unless you're arguing that our picks the last 2 years were airballs which is dumb since they mostly look good given their age and experience, or you're talking about the Patrick McCaw and Jordan Bell picks which we essentially got for free)."
"I don’t even know why I watched then, but I vow to never watch Jacob Evans or Jordan Bell play another minute of basketball in my life."
"Boucher is absolutely the funniest and most heartbreaking member of the Warrior fan G-League Infatuation Club. It's absolutely painful how much he got talked about as a guy who was going to make a huge splash once he got the chance then never got a real chance with the Warriors. Of course he gets a chance somewhere else, absolutely murders it and we're stuck with feint memories of Jordan Bell missing practice and ""pranking"" a coach."
“How did the league let the Warriors get Jordan Bell??”
Don’t forget Jordan Bell and that one offseason everyone thought he was the Warriors future at center
Jordan Bell
SMH Nephews actin like Jordan Bell wouldn't take all $200 of Chuck's lunch money
"I think the tough part with ""what-ifs"" is that it can go both ways.   If Iggy wasn't out for 4 games, would the series even of go 7 games?   Im not saying CP3 wasnt a bigger loss then iggy, but Warriors lost game 4 and 5 by 3pts and 4 pts respectively. If Iggy was playing you cant tell me he couldnt contribute 3pts worth of value over nick Young, jordan bell or Quinn Cook.    That being said, the chris Paul injury was huge. That was such a great rivalry and series that it sucks that not everyone was at full strength.   Additionally, I  think the harden/CP3 rockets would of smashed the Cavs, and are one of the greatest teams  of all time who didn't win the championship."
"fr brotha. Ppl not realize we had McKinnie, Jerebko, Quinn Cook, Jordan Bell out out here playing minutes. Huge diff team wise lol, and we ran Curry Klay Dray and KD minutes wise into the ground to make up for our depth."
Not sure how you could say this when your team had both Jordan Bell and Damian Jones. They probably jumped at the word pumpfake in this comment thread already.
Just went and watched some nba champion Jordan bell dunk highlights. That dude looked pretty nice off the PnR. Remember when he threw himself an oop in like his first week in the nba?
*nightmares of jordan bell slowly emerge*
Fewer than Jordan Bell. I have hope.
"If i had to take this kyrie or klay I'd take Kyrie, harden or steph i'd take harden. So to me at the top end talent this team is EVEN better than the bets team ever.  Then the suppporting cast, the GSW had Draw/Iggy/Mcgee/Bell/Livingstone/Young/West/Looney/Zaza/Mccaw The nets have Harris/Green/Jordan/Blake/LMA/Green/Claxton/TLC/Brown/Shamet/Roberson/Johsnon and an injured Dinwiddie.  I persoanlly don't think you can say the GSW roster is better, let alone MUCH better. They have THREE players who could legitimately have a shot at winning MVP this year if they had their own teams then you have joe harris shooting 50% from 3 and lemarcus aldridge at center....that starting lineup is straight up bonkers."
I kinda feel bad for Jordan Bell for how much I felt forced to hate on the guy because of people acting like selling the pick used to take him was some massively significant move.
It was the same thing with the Warriors.  People acted as if they were getting absolute peak Cousins or the next Dennis Rodman when they bought the pick that they used to take Jordan Bell.
People overreact to superteam moves   U guys remember when Bulls let Jordan Bell go and Warrios got him and this entire sub had a meltdown
"This supporting cast is way better than that year's outside of Iguodala. Shaun Livingston, Bogut were totally washed, Alfonzo McKinnie, Quinn Cook and Jordan Bell were not NBA level players. Marquese Chriss is better than whatever Boogie was that year. We'd basically be starting Oubre and Wiggins over McKinnie/Bell/Jerebko  Guys like Mannion, Wiseman, Poole probably wouldn't play much in a finals game when the rotations shorten. Steph would likely play closer to 40+ minutes instead of his usual 36. Raptors still win in 7 though"
This is why I will always hate Jordan Bell. He was sent out there as a mercenary. And I know klay had a body foul on a Harden three in that game that didn't get called.
Klay and Jordan Bell
Jordan (Bell) would ~~never~~
"29 is better than 30 correct?  But to recap, 2013, they get the number 30 player in the draft via draft day trade and had no second round picks.  Didn't workout.  2014 I think they had no picks. 2015-draft Looney (who is on the team today and would be/has been a rotation player in the regular season and playoffs/finals), no second round pick.  2016-draft Damion Jones (terrible pick) with the 30 (1 pick after Murray), and McCaw with 38.  2017-bought a second round pick (38) and got Jordan Bell.  2018-had the 28th pick and Jacob Evans (not a good player).  Who are all the other teams that had lower picks but drafted better than the Warriors over that span?  2013-2018 their highest level pick was 28, had two no. 30 picks, and two no. 38 picks.  What teams got great players at those level picks?  What is the average player at those picks?  Who are the ""every other team had lower picks but also drafted better than the Warriors.""  Who are those teams?  Are you just saying that if you took every player after those picks you would have better players?  That might be true but it's not really useful as a metric."
"Paschall is back, and Jordan Bell + Gary Payton II have been signed."
Nah fuck that man I wanna see Jordan Bell out there taking spears to the chest while guarding Lebron in the play in. He’s just gotta pull that shit right out his chest and use it to get Steph to the playoffs.
Paschall and Jordan Bell are going to be playing against the Pels too. So that's 4 more bodies to get some or a lot of burn against the Pels (who are also sitting their stars).
"LOL. On bball-ref it shows for Pels game:  * Curry: day-to-day (tailbone) questionable  * Green: day-to-day (finger) questionable  * Mulder: day-to-day (knee) questionable  * Oubre: out (wrist)  * Paschall: day-to-day (hip) **probable**  * Wiggins: day-to-day (knee) questionable  Looks like Nico, Paschall, Jordan Bell, and Smiley are gonna get big minutes on national TV lol. ESPN must be mad af since the Pels have Lonzo and Zion listed as out for Friday, and BI and Steven Adams as questionable. I doubt BI or Adams will play either since they've been eliminated. We're gonna have a rooks &amp; G-Leaguer battle on national TV."
"We should rest Steph, Dray, and Wiggins for the Pels game. Let Nico, Smiley, the Mitten, and Jordan Bell have a field day."
It’s gonna be the nico mannion Jordan bell show tomorrow against the pelicans.
We just signed Jordan Bell and GPII and Paschall is coming back for the Pels game. Literally just play Nico and Smiley 30 minutes and we'll have enough healthy bodies.
"Friendship with ""Jordan Bell is new Draymond"" has ended.      Now Juan T is my new Draymond."
Jordan Bell too.
"Very intereseting. I think he has some clear limitations but the Warriors are really missing guard depth and a plug and play perimeter defender would be huge for the Warriors in the post season.   Now that Wiseman (and to a lesser extent Oubre) are out of the lineup we're really seeing what this team could have been all season. But they are massively lacking depth. Legit 8 man rotation for weeks now.   Eric Paschall is reportedly very close to coming back, Jordan Bell is getting signed to a two way and will be available for the playoffs, but Damion Lee sounds far away after contracting COVID and Oubre is a complete question mark.   None of these guys will likely play a ton of minutes in the post season but just have the big man depth and a little extra depth at guard is a big deal for this team."
"Jordan ""**C**ash **A**ward **N**ot **D**esired **L**et's **E**xpense (it)"" Bell  I tried."
"Jordan ""**C**ash **R**ules **E**verything **A**round **M**e"" Bell"
Don't forget the GOAT Jordan Bell is back
Warriors trade cash considerations to Jordan Bell for Jordan Bell
Can't wait for them Jordan Poole to Jordan Bell lobs
"Jordan ""Draymond Green 2.0"" ""Cash Considerations"" Bell"
"Clint Capela. His stats are good and he looks good but I watched him get absolutely sonned by Jordan Bell and Kevon Looney in the playoffs so for that reason, I’m out * Mr Wonderful Voice *"
Help is on the way.  Michael Jordan Bell is going to contribute.
"I worry about how the team will play once we start to get some bodies back. Despite the short rotation, everyone knows their role. Toss in Paschall, who’s never quite fit in the system, DLee, whose clearly been surpassed by Poole, and Oubre, who is likely still nursing his injury, and suddenly the team has lots of uncertainty in the mix.   And then there’s the Jordan Bell factor. Even though it’s unlikely Bell will see real playing time, should that happen, Bell will need time to acclimate.   I’m going to enjoy these post-season games as much as possible. The team has earned their playoff spot. But I’m also a realist. Whatever progress the team makes into the playoffs is a reward for hard work, determination, and in some cases, absolute stubbornness."
Just in time for the goat Jordan Bell to return and lead his team on a playoff run
"KD, Pat McCaw, Jordan Bell, DeMarcus Cousins, Anderson Varejao"
"Protections vary depending on the terms of the trade, and they're evaluated after the lottery takes place. [This massive page](https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/draft/future_drafts/detailed) can help you figure out the details of specific picks.   If you scroll down to Houston and look at the first item in the outgoing column, the situation for the pick in question is there.  &gt;  **2021 first round draft pick to Oklahoma City (swap, less favorable of Oklahoma City or Miami incoming)** Oklahoma City will receive the two most favorable of its 2021 1st round pick, Miami's 2021 1st round pick and Houston's 2021 1st round pick protected for selections 1-4 and Houston will receive the least favorable of the three (via Miami to Phoenix to Philadelphia to L.A. Clippers to Oklahoma City; via Oklahoma City's right to swap Oklahoma City or Miami for Houston); **if the Houston pick falls within its protected range and is therefore not conveyable, then Houston's obligation to Oklahoma City will be extinguished** and Oklahoma City will instead receive its pick and the Miami pick [Miami-New Orleans-Phoenix, 2/19/2015; Philadelphia-Phoenix, 6/21/2018; L.A. Clippers-Philadelphia, 2/6/2019; L.A. Clippers-Oklahoma City, 7/10/2019; Houston-Oklahoma City, 7/16/2019]; Houston may convey this pick to Brooklyn in 2021 (see Houston Incoming)  So if they do get pick 1, 2, 3, or 4 in the lottery, they don't have to give OKC anything in return. There's only a 52.1% chance of that happening.  That's not always the norm. A lot of trades will have some sort of caveat where if a protected pick doesn't convey one year, then the next year's pick is owed (sometimes with looser protections). But pick swaps (which I think this is) seem to be options that apply only to a single year at a time.   Random history example: The Kings once traded away a 1st round pick that was protected top 14 the first year, top 13 the next, then top 12, then top 10 for the next 3 years, and then became a 2nd round pick after they failed so many years in a row to win enough games to convey the pick. That final year, the Kings pick that they kept jumped in the lottery to #3 and swapped with Philly down to #5 due to a different trade. Philly traded the #3 pick to Boston to get #1 and draft Markelle Fultz. Boston used the #3 pick on Jayson Tatum. The Kings used the #5 pick on DeAaron Fox. The second round pick conveyed instead went to Chicago, who eventually sold it to the Warriors, who drafted Jordan Bell with it."
"&gt; When were these players starting in the Finals?  I guess you can't just look it up. Jordan Bell, who played in the G League this year and has been bouncing around on 10 day contracts started Game 1.  Shaun Livingston who was a shell of himself averaging 4ppg that year and retired after the series, started game 3 (and went 1-4 in that game).  Demarcus Cousins, who tore his quad earlier in the playoffs, started 3 games clearly hobbled but he was literally the only true center on the roster at that point and the Warriors needed size against Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka. Cousins ended up averaging 8 ppg on an abysmal 45 eFG%.  Quinn Cook and Alfonzo McKinnie played 20+ minutes in several games. Both were G League players the Warriors picked up. Cook is no longer in the league and McKinnie is riding the Lakers bench scoring 3 ppg.   Looney played well in the playoffs but in Game 2 he fractured his ribs, missed game 3, and was hampered by this injury for the rest of the series.   &gt;You were not coming back to win shit.  I don't know why you think I believe the Warriors were coming back. This point is basically a non-sequiter. I said the Warriors faced a huge talent disparity between their injuries and lack of roster depth. They were absolutely not a great team without KD and the other guys that missed games. They were extremely top heavy and with injuries to KD, Klay, Iguodala, Cousins, and Looney, they had no chance in the series."
"Lol it’s very much being the literal police. I can read that comment and still feel secure in knowing that while it’s a notable interesting stat, it doesn’t mean he was better offensively than the Warriors. You read that comment and it sends you into a frenzy of “WHY WOULD WE COMPARE HARDEN TO JORDAN BELL!? MAKES NO SENSE MAN. WARRIORS BETTER IDIOTS”.  Lmao"
"It’s not the literal police… he wasn’t close to being as good as a Steph jumper off a screen or a Gobert P&amp;R, and I’m not sure why we should feel the need to defend hyperbole.    Again, though, that doesn’t really have anything to do with the fact that comparing his iso to team’s isos just doesn’t make any sense to do.  Why do I care if Harden is better than a dataset that includes Jordan Bell and Damion Lee and Quinn Cook?   The comparison just doesn’t make logical sense."
"The Warriors were starting literal G League players. Quinn Cook, Alfonzo McKinnie, Jordan Bell, a completely broken down Shaun Livingston, a broken Cousins, Looney was injured and Iguodala had a bad back. The talent disparity was huge."
Jordan Bell has a pretty good BBIQ. He’s just small and his skill set is really limited.
Hennything is possible with Jordan Bell
Not as bad as when they had Jordan Bell at least.
Javale and Jordan bell were not a high IQ centera and they played well for the warriors.
"Jordan Bell played three years in college. James Wiseman played three games. Plus, Bell was playing alongside KD, Klay, and Andre.  He also definitely did not look like a starting big lol. He had a couple good games."
Yeah this is an offense that made Jordan Bell look like a starting big in this league...
And that's saying a lot considering we've had Kelly Oubre and Jordan Bell
"&gt; how badly I wanted us to pick up Dedmon when he was inexpicably not signed to a team  A subset of Warriors fans been saying this for a while now, ever since Quese broke his leg right before our 3rd game of the season. Instead we waited until the last week of the season to sign Jordan Bell again lol."
 Jordan Bell signed yesterday for the Warriors again
"&gt; I really want to know more about this candle  According to Bogut, the vets would prank the rookies by ordering things and charging it to the rookies account. Jordan Bell bought some snacks, but for some reason he decided to write Mike Brown's name, an assistant coach for the Warriors as opposed to a teammates. Dumbest part is he wrote his name, cancelled it out and then wrote Mike Brown's name. The hotel called Mike Brown down to charge him because they didn't have a card on file, and he refused to pay. Looking at receipt with Bell's name on it, and the video they decided to call Bell down. He denied the charges despite being caught on tape."
"The Warriors were starting JORDAN BELL, he’s not even in the league. Neither is McKinnie (or he basically doesn’t play). Kanter is still a good NBA player.   Basketball isn’t just Steph playing Kanter in the pnr for 48 min. How’d they get up 17 3 games in a row? The excuses...  No one, not a single soul, thought that was gonna be a sweep without KD."
Lol. I remember telling a friend that Jordan Bell would be better than Laurie Maraanen. Whoops!
"Right so when the Rockets acquired him, it was a 4 team deal where they essentially traded Capela and a 1st for: Covington, Jordan Bell, and a 2nd. When the Blazers acquired him, they gave the Rockets Ariza and TWO 1st round picks. So both of the Covington trades involved more than just one 1st round pick. That was because the Rockets were desperate to acquire him so they gave up Capela and a 1st, then the Blazers were desperate to acquire him so they gave up Ariza and 2 1st rounders. So it also depends on the desperation of the teams involved. I’m sure the Pelicans will be looking to target similarly desperate teams in order to get a lopsided deal when they are shopping their picks. Teams that are heading into a forced rebuild or something of that nature where they are willing to give up solid players or 1 star player in return for future draft capital."
that article actually links the database that has the stat.

"I mean if you're a team in a position like the kings are, you try things out too see how they go and see if your team can be where a player puts it all together. in Damian's case it clearly didn't work lol, but the potential was there   i mean you guys just signed Jordan Bell and he sucks ass too. this kind of thing happens all the time."
Jordan Bell? I thought we are done with this superteam nonsense

wait why is Jordan Bell coming back ?!?!?
Lol Jordan Bell is back.
JTA's promotion is well deserved but Jordan Bell returning to the Warriors is such an indictment on Smailagic and Nepotism Lacob. The team is desperate for a big - actually any able body - but Smiley is so unplayable they'd rather give fucking Jordan Bell another chance. Lol
Jordan Bell oh shit!! Lol
I remember is like 2018 Jordan Bell had a really good game and everyone was sure that he was the next Draymond Green
Jordan Bell has the physique of a super hero but holy shit he just didn't have a feel for the game.  &amp;#x200B;  Where's Alfonzo at?
"It's about process, not result. All teams should look for ways to add players with upside. How else does a contender add young talent when they're consistently picking low in the draft? Whereas the rebuilding bulls had no business trying to save money when they needed to just add talent. It's paying for an extra dart throw, even if it's low probability of hitting. Jordan Bell may not have worked but the next guy could be another Draymond, Arenas, Ellis, etc. One hit and it can change your franchise for 5-10+ years."
"Jordan Bell? Word? I'm all for that spot going to GP II (a different person, BTW, than GP, Jr.)"
"When a shooter pretends to shoot but doesn’t (pump fake) and the defender (JBell) leaves his feet (bites), the shooter can then either shoot and draw contact (a foul that earns two free throws) or dribble past the defender who can’t cover because he’s up in the air.  The Warriors, especially Looney and Draymond, were generally excellent at not biting/fouling.  Jordan Bell, cannot not bite.  It got to where Kerr/Draymond would not even bother to yell at JBell anymore because they could see that he was trying, but just unable to not bite."
Jordan Bell played 35 times more games in college than Wiseman. He also didn’t spend over a year not playing competitive basketball before joining an NBA team with no camp at all.
Is Smiligiac the new Jordan Bell?
Can we all light a candle for Jordan Bell?
"Jordan Bell had *at least* three of Steph, Klay, Dray, Andre Igoudala, Shaun Livingston (who had played 3 Playoffs/2 Finals together) and KD on the court with him."

"Jordan bell is the reason I’m concerned about about Wiseman. I know that this team is a far cry from the GS super team, but Steph was able to make bell look promising whereas wiseman just looks terrible 90% of the time he’s on the court."
I didn't know Jordan Bell was not on a team I wouldn't have minded the Blazers grabbing his up a while ago.
Dude fuck Jordan Bell give Lin a shot

"It always breaks my heart when Jordan Bell bites on the pump fake.  Not because he fouls or gets blown by, but because you can see in his eyes that he didn’t want to, but his body betrayed him...again"
so thrilled for jta. he's earned that contract. he's the type of hard nosed player everyone would want on their team.   jordan bell is an upgrade over smailagic i guess. what a waste of a roster spot that is. i'd rather they bring back omari spellman

The same Jordan Bell that rented a porno and blamed it on the coach?
 We LITERALLY started Damian Jones and Jordan Bell in the WCF and finals WITHOUT KD
Facts Jordan Bell was a monster in his prime
PG: Jalen Brunson  SG: Jaylen Brown  SF: Jimmy Butler  PF: Jordan Bell  C: Uhh... Jaron Blossomgame
This is overblown probably. Its normal to not have 'proper' practice like the other comments said. Im sure theyll have shootarounds and open gyms available (note: remember when Jordan Bell didnt turn up to an optional training)
"At what point do you call a spade a spade with Wiseman. I mean, steph was able to make *Jordan Bell* look decent as a rookie."
"Norvell Pelle, Noah Vonleh, Jordan Bell, khem Birch, Zach Collins, Henry Giles, Alize Johnson"
Jordan Bell. For how he handled the avdija injury
"Chris Paul too, remember the Wolves/Thunder game last year where he called out Jordan Bell for his untucked jersey"
"I think a healthy Russ is more valuable for you guys though, and Gafford is better than Len or Lopez (although Lopez has his match-up uses). Isn't Bryant a massive liability on defense for you guys, unlike Gafford?  Ugh and yikes about the Deni injury. Thank god Jordan Bell hid it. I didn't want to see what happened to it."
Good on Jordan Bell. I have a rough time watching guys get hurt like this and other guys on the court freak out around him. That is unhelpful.
"Man look at Dr. Beal running out there immediately, what a guy  Edit: Nvm that's Jordan Bell but point stands, he responds to that like a professional"
"Oh no, Deni :((((((((((  This kid means a lot to a lot of people but more than anything he's a kid on a journey and I bet some of his reaction is fear of this putting an end to his NBA career  I really hope he'll bounce back and feel better ♥  also, Jordan Bell - got my respect for life. Team shit."
"I don't want to say I'm relieved now, because it still looks bad. But the way Jordan Bell covered it up, I was worried it was going to be a compound fracture or a complete dislocation."
"Landed on his own ankle, it was bad enough that Jordan Bell ran up and covered his angle with a shirt immediately."
Went down after landing on Bazemores foot. But even with the replays I really couldn't tell what happened. He was holding his ankle and Jordan Bell rushed in and threw a shirt on his foot/ankle.
Was his bone sticking out? Jordan bell covered it up
Went up for an offensive board and came down on Kent Bazemore's foot. immediately went down and Jordan Bell came to cover up his right leg/ankle/shin area with a towel.
"Good on Jordan Bell, I couldn't watch the replay"
"Nah, he's actually related to Michael Jordan the baseball player, if that rings a bell"
"I think if Jordan Bell didn't become complacent, he had it in him to develop into a valuable player for us. He showed good flashes of potential on that Oregon team, and with us during his rookie season. Too bad he got drunk on success and just seemed to lose the will to keep working on his game."
I thought Jordan Bell was gonna develop as well. Bell knew the splits and screening with Curry. Still glad we at least had Looney to be consistent. His defense on Harden was a beautiful thing to watch.
He was the leading scorer in that finals from both sides playing alongside Mckinnie and Jordan bell
Instead we kept Jordan Bell. Boucher and Brooks are better than him. Our scouting/player development really fell off a year or 2 after we signed KD... missed a bunch of young talent or let them go.
"&gt;Not a ridiculous argument at all lmfao they had shaun livingston who was still excellent back then, ridiculous argument by you  Livingston can't shoot, which means the Warriors refrained from using him in their small lineups.  &gt;Looney still was going to get minutes regardless, he got minutes the next season in the series too. Not sure why you think iggy is on the floor at all times  Sure, but he played a lot more than he would have if Iguodala was healthy. And lol, I'm pointing out that when you have a guy who normally plays around 30 minutes, those minutes are going somewhere when he is out. Unfortunately for the Warriors, they went to Bell and Looney (who isn't bad, but was overmatched against Houston).   &gt;You’re really using that as an excuse? The warriors had looney in the paint, we had capella in the paint with Draymond playing free safety. The same shit applies. You make no sense  The issue is the Warriors would normally play small for very long stretches of the game, which they couldn't do with Iguodala out. How do you not get this?   &gt;That’s on them for abandoning there strategy, they had livingston so they still could have done it.  No, because the spacing doesn't work there. Livingston can't shoot.   &gt;You’re really overrating iguadolas defense, harden put up 35 on 60% TS the next series with iguadola playing every game, we just ended up losing because we were worse that season  That was a year later lol. Harden didn't shoot well with Iguodala guarding him in 2018, and neither did CP3. Are you really contesting that Iguodala is a huge upgrade over Jordan Bell and Kevon Looney??  &gt; “A bit of defense” lmao just admit you didn’t watch a second of lrmam play. He was easily our best defender or second behind tucker.  Yes ""a bit of defense"". Tucker and Ariza were both excellent, and Gordon was serviceable. Replacing LRMAM's minutes with those guys isn't some big downgrade.   &gt;I’m not arguing we were better or even more talented, I’m arguing that we deserved to win that series and you’re not going to say we didn’t because they were missing a 5 PPG old man compared to an allstar and a role player.  You didn't deserve to win the series first of all. Injuries are part of the game. The team that ""deserves"" to win is the team that actually went out there and got it done. Secondly, the injury to Iguodala was simply more impactful compared to LRMAM. There is simply no way you can argue that the downgrade from Iguodala to Looney and Bell (especially on defense) is the same as the downgrade from LRMAM to PJ Tucker, Trevor Ariza, and Eric Gordon. Combine that with the Warriors being unable to play small, which was by far their best lineup for years, and the downgrade is simply much larger. Houston was going home regardless of health. I'm sure you won't agree, so let's just agree to disagree. We'll never know who would have won for sure. You have your opinions, and I have mine."
"&gt;God you make the worst arguments   Lol  &gt;We had players who played like LRMAM because we only had 2 stars, golden state had 4 fucking allstar level players, why can’t you make that connection?  What are you even trying to say here? What does the number of All Stars have to do with anything?   &gt;Jordan bell literally played like 15 mins a game. Iguadola didn’t make a single fucking 3 in any of the games he played. That shit is irrelevant, they had livingston and cook aswell.  Jordan Bell played around 15 per game, Looney played some of Iguodala minutes as well. They both got cooked repeatedly. And Iguodala being capable of shooting the 3 at all means the defense has to account for this. When Bell and Looney were playing, they kind of stood next to the block on offense, which made it easy for Houston to help on Steph and KD.   &gt;We could have took capella out and put LRMAM in to match there small ball lineup and you don’t understand this, I don’t know why.  Except they did thay without him, with Gordon, Tucker, Ariza, CP3, and Harden all playing at once.   &gt;Lol harden and cp would have been just fine iguadola or not. Harden was playing bad because he was just missing threes, contests rarely matter for him he’s proved he can score on iguadola all the time. And that’s not even true, harden was scoring on a variety of players, was just cold.  Harden and CP3 shot horribly with Iguodala guarding them in the first 3 games. Contests absolutely do matter lol wtf, and Harden and CP3 were able to get into the paint much more easily with Bell and Looney guarding them.  &gt;And nice of you to point out total points and nothing else, they both shot horrible and iguadola didn’t matter. Nobody’s exaggerating.  They would have shot even worse with Iguodala guarding them, which is the point. And they would have had a much tougher time stopping the Warriors on offense.  &gt;At the end of the day 1 role player compared to 1 role player and a star isn’t even a discussion to be had  That's not hownot works at all lol. Different role players carry different levels of importance. For the Warriors, they simply had to compromise more after Iguodala went down. Sorry, but your Rockets were going home with an L regardless of health."
"You're talking about the regular season, when Iguodala's role and level of play increased in the playoffs. Better on defense, massively better at playmaking, better at slashing, etc. He was playing way more minutes and starting. LRMAM was not playing nearly as many minutes, and simply is the inferior player. The Rockets were not going 6 deep in games 4 and 5 lol, that was after CP3 went down. They don't lose spacing or lineup flexibility by benching LRMAM, and hardly lose defense. The drop-off from Iguodala to Jordan Bell is simply far steeper than the drop-off from LRMAM to the other Rockets role players. If you watched the games, Harden and CP3 had an absolute field day against Bell. Sorry, but if Iguodala plays in games 4 and 5, you lose."
"Game 7 wouldn't have occurred if Iguodala was healthy.  Iguodala is a better playoff performer than LRMAM, and was critical to the Warriors success. He was a starter in that series, unlike LRMAM, and was critical to the Warriors spacing, playmaking, and perimeter defense. The Rockets simply split LRMAM's minutes among Gordon, Ariza, and Tucker, all of which where better players than him. Replacing Iguodala with Jordan Bell is a huge blow on both ends, but especially on defense. Sorry, but Mbah a Moute doesn't compare."
"I feel like the Pierce and Jordan Bell incidents are terrible examples. Those were super unique incidents, whereas this comment chain is about flopping and yelling at refs on your everyday, numerous per game type of plays/no-calls. And yeah, some other guys may flop and whine like LeBron does, but that doesn’t make it fun to watch LeBron do it. He’s the most iconic player of this century so it’s natural his name will come up in discussions where he’s relevant. He’s relevant here because he flops and whines constantly. Simple as that"
"Not really considering Iguodala was out for 2 games before CP3 went down, which forced them to abandon their small ball lineup and play Jordan Bell big minutes. Warriors were still better with both teams healthy."
Paul Pierce left the court in a wheelchair during the finals because he had to take a shit. CP3 snitched on Jordan Bell entering the game with his jersey untucked and whines and flops all game. Harden and Trey foul hunt all game. Every player does it. Lebron is hacked all game and his free throw attempts don’t reflect it
"Lol all the Rockets had to do was win one game. KD was also out with score tied or Warriors behind in the 4th of game 5. Warriors didnt have Iguodala without whom they struggle to play their small ball lineups and no bench the next year. You lost to a team of Jordan Bell, Kevon Looney and Quinn Cook the next year."
"Correction, Jordan Bell lost a game because he didn't follow the rules"
"I said then and I still say now that we should've gotten Dillon Brooks with our 10th pick that draft instead of bust Zach Collins, but I'm also biased because he and Jordan Bell led my college team to a final four. Grizzlies got a STEAL with him and I'm happy he's doing well with them."
"Jordan Bell is a fraud, he poured that Henny away."
"In terms of Henny, JR Smith is a Charizard while Jordan Bell is a mere Charmander"
But can he handle more Henny than Jordan Bell? 🤔
"Didnt Leonard score 30 in a half in one of those games? IIRC Warriors were playing Alfonso Mckinnie, Jordan Bell and Quinn cook major minutes that series. Was a close series but I dont think Id call that team a deserving WCF, although I dont think Dame is the problem."
"They did allow a lot more but it wouldn't change much.   We say physicality this and that but did players start scoring way more when hand checking was removed? You can go through the whole league and it made very little difference. It's the usual bell pattern. Rookie comes in , had decent numbers, gets a little better , peaks and then declines.   We pre ejaculate often when we speak about the Jordan rules due to nostalgia  but it only worked when MJ didn't have people who could score. As soon as he had a better roster who could make shots, it didn't help the Pistons all that much. Physicality didn't help back then either and those guys weren't as good shooting wise. Bulls were never considered a bruising team. They were athletic.   Many still believe DET would shut down GSW with KD lol.   They got swept. They couldn't clog the paint anymore and they had to stretch out. An athletic guy like MJ feasted on it.   Years ago, I rewatched the bills vs piston games and MJ passed often to the open man. They missed a lot of shots. The Pistons would get swept today as well.  We like to think Curry is small  and would not survive the physical play but thing is he is bigger than Zeke. Human anatomy is human anatomy. If Zeke made it through. So could Curry. If they allow the same rules, people will expect hits and hands to the forearm etc. They whine today because the rules say you cannot do it but if we call it by the book, almost every play is a foul.  Not because they're soft.   Another reason why NBA made rules to avoid altercations is time is money. They need games to finish within the slotted time. Time is money."
"I wanted Portland to take him in the draft, but we traded away our second rounder to the Rockets - who then used that pick to take Brooks. Then they immediately traded him to Memphis. Unbelievable.   I also want the Blazers to somehow get Jordan Bell that year. And of course I though Payton Pritchard would have made a great backup PG, but he didn't fall far enough to get him in the second round."
"Better than the Warriors.  We really have GLeague players playing in the play in. JTA and Mychal fucking Mulder.   Then the rest of the bench? Smailagic, Jordan bell, etc, fuckin bums"
I mean Jordan Bell and Chris Boucher all look like beasts at Oregon too. Boucher is a built different tho
Jordan Bell also started Game 1 of the 2019 Finals.
"I mean Oubre looked good on paper and he started to play well before getting hurt.  If you’re this hung up about not getting Noel, consider that Chiss was supposed to be on the team.  I’d have picked him going into the season too.  But unfortunately he got a season ending injury at the worst time, after the season started with no bigs left on the market.  I do agree that they should have tried harder at the deadline.  What did keeping Javale reallly get the Cavs?  I’d have to believe a future second or two could have got him back.  Jordan Bell certainly didn’t help (did he even play in the play-in games?)."
"Does anyone else remember that Oregon team with Brooks, Jordan Bell, Chris Boucher, Tyler Dorsey, and Payton Pritchard?  Might’ve been my fave college basketball team I’ve ever followed (I just pick and choose college teams depending on the year)."
Jordan bell isn’t worth the 10 mil a year?
"Gafford is a very good player.. idk abt hutchinson... warriors have damion lee, JTA, mulder, mannion, smiley, GP2, jordan bell.. every single one of those played in the g league.. they have 2 ppg looney. Im certain that if looney leaves the warriors he will be out of the league in 2yrs.. dude im not lying.. bazemore started his career in the g league. Was undrafted and as a 9yr vet he has an IQ of a rookie.."
Gotta mention Jordan Bell single handedly blocking every shot in the Kansas game though
"Lot of mofos leaving us though   I dont want mulder, smailagic, baze, jordan bell, damian lee on the roster next season 😂"
I guess Curry can’t win without Jordan bell
Jordan Bell talking trash to his old team
Where’s Jordan Bell smh
"Imagine Kerr looking down at his bench for a spark and he sees Jordan Bell, Gary Payton II, Nico Mannion and Alen Smailagic   Masterclass by Bob Meyers of how to build a shit team around a GOAT level player"
The Jordan Bell of broadcasting don’t know shit.
"Even in the 2019 Finals it was bad.  Outside of the main guys (and obviously KD basically didn't play), you had older/less effective Iguodala and Livingston, Cousins, Looney, Quinn Cook, Alfonzo McKinnie, washed Andrew Bogut, Jonas Jerebko, Jordan Bell, Jacob Evans, Damian Jones...  Remove KD and Klay from when they were hurt and it was not good."
NBA champion Jordan Bell
Jordan Bell about to go Kwame on em
What Jordan Bell do to JVG to deserve this lmao
"JVG recognizes that he's the Jordan Bell of commentators?  Well, maybe he can go back to an old team for lousy money to fix some of his mistakes then."
"I picture Jordan Bell doing his ""cash considerations"" taunt at JVG when he sees him next, and JVG just tipping him."
I still remember that moving screen Jordan Bell made to literally box out Harden? and let Curry get an open 3. Bad memories

"Poor Jordan Bell, but personally I like this casual style of commentating. I like hear passion and excitimeant in voices, not some learnt phrases. Good job JVG."
Jordan Bell will always be funny
Jordan Bell in shambles
see? just proves that Curry needs Jordan Bell!  /s
I heard Draymond practices eye pokes on Jordan Bell before games and thats why they re-signed him.
Jordan Bell: “tf I do?”
Alfonzo McKinnie and Jordan Bell were starters for the Warriors in the 2019 NBA Finals lol
"Brooks wasn't really a PF. He was playing alongside Jordan Bell and Chris Boucher a lot. He was more of a 3 and initiated a lot of PnR on offense. He may have defended 4s at times, but if you had to label him as anything it'd be a ""3"""
Van Gundy better shut up before Jordan Bell clap back on his ass like Kwame been doing to everybody
Jordan Bell!
Since when the fuck did Jordan Bell go back to the Warriors?
"Mike Breen - **""Did you just say ~~Taco Bell~~ Jordan Bell?""**"

Jordan Bell gonna run up a tab in a gift shop and charge it JVG's room
Waiting for the Jordan Bell rant.
I think JVG hesitated and was trying to find one former warriors player that he think will be appropriate here and finally settled with Jordan Bell

Don't forget Micheal Jordan Bell
"I think our main lineup will probably be DG, JTA, Looney, Curry and Wiggins. Our other big is Jordan Bell, who is also...not really that big"
That’s true Jordan bell got a bunch of shit when he threw it off the backboard to himself in a big blowout win
"I don't know why I felt the need to do this, but I looked at all of the Warriors 5 man lineups from that season that had Curry, Thompson, and Durant in it. They played 941 minutes together.  I think we can cross off any lineup that has Zaza, Dray, Javale, Jordan Bell, or Looney in it. That's 927 of the 941 minutes, or 98.5% of the minutes they were on the court together.   Despite what you wrote, Shaun Livingston was 0/5 from 3 that year. David West was 3/8 from 3 of that year. That crosses another 13 minutes of the list. Iguodala shot 28% that year, so cross him off. Pat McCaw shot 28%. Which leaves us with exactly one lineup:  Was Durant, Curry, Klag, Omri Casspi, and Swaggy P the best shooting lineup to be on the floor together? Was that under 30 seconds of time together the best we'll ever see?"
"This is what I mean about fans who don’t appreciate our FO. Over expectations and impatience. The Wiseman pick is something to still be evaluated, if they thought he was the best choice in the draft at #2 then I’m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, even if he has not looked as good as someone like LaMelo *so far*. The Warriors offense being bad without Steph? Well they weren’t exactly expecting Klay to have a freak injury sidelining him for *another year*. And Oubre is our bandaid over that crack, it’s the best that could be done given that stroke of bad luck. Our cap situation isn’t exactly stellar and no vets are going to sign for the minimum on a team with no championship aspirations for this year. Our draft picks not working out? Does Jordan Poole ring a bell? And we’ve been picking at the end of the first round for multiple years. The fact we hit on Jordan Poole at his draft position is very lucky.   The only point I’d be willing to concede in the future is Wiseman if he doesn’t turn positive within the next year. But the rest is over expectations and impatience given where we are at cap-wise, draft-wise, and with Klay’s injury. I’m personally pretty pleased with what the front office has been able to do despite these handicaps, and I think more fans should be overall. That’s not to say they’re immune from criticism of course."
"Dray and Wiggins are off limits. But I wouldn't mind taking KCP for Mychal Mulder, Caruso for Gary Payton II, and Zubac for Jordan Bell.  Oubre's kind of a moot point right now since he's out another 7-10 days before reevaluation.... and I think that news was broke Thursday or Friday? I get the feeling dude probably needs to either shut it down or get surgery for the torn wrist ligament and broken palm, but he's holding out until Warriors get eliminated before completely ruling out a return because there appears to be a chance that he can still play without getting surgery or shutting down in a best case scenario."
Jordan bell looked to have a lot of potential but he screwed it all up with his attitude issues
"Jonas Valančiūnas absolute abused us. Don't worry. We don't have much in the way of reinforcements (Jordan Bell, lol, and Gary Payton II signing again this weekend)  By the way that is also me right now."
Jordan Bell was screaming “tuck it in…tuck it in”
When he marries Jordan Bell for the health insurance benefits.
"Also I get that signing Oubre meant taking a huge tax hit, but then when guys like Chriss go down for the season, don't sign a vet big man (lots of fans wanted to sign Dedmon, for example), and run an 8 man rotation ragged hoping nobody gets injured while leaving roster spots open until the deadline before signing Jordan Bell and Gary Payton II (to be done over the weekend) just to meet minimum...  It's a weird dichotomy between spending huge and trimming at the edges. I get that every bit of extra tax bill hurts, but still... gotta protect the players you already have, or else franchise is DONE done."
"That’s because the Warriors have a reputation for drafting well now so any pick they make is immediately assumed to be great. People made Jordan Bell sound like Chris Webber when he got drafted. Same thing’s been happening to the Spurs for years.  You guys get it in reverse, doesn’t matter if you make the consensus “right” pick or not, it’s immediately assumed that whoever you take will be bad because you’re the Knicks and Knicks bad."
"Yeah, but Jordan Bell was supposed to be Draymond 2.0 and Patrick McCaw was supposed to be Iggy 2.0.  It's been great watching JTA and Poole develop into solid rotation contributors though."
"Smiley saw us bringing back the GOAT at jumping on pump fakes, Jordan Bell, and knew he needed to step up his game."
The only thing I remember (as someone who watched 80+ percent of the games) was calling for the refs to give the t wolves a delay of game penalty for an untucked jersey (Jordan bell if my memory is correct). That gave us a free throw to cut it to one.  Kat hit his second free throw and then Steven Adams had the crazy pass to Dennis to send it to OT where we won
Jordan Bell
It absolutely is about the drop off lmao. Playoff basketball is all about matchups and abusing the worst ones. The Warriors 5th guy on the floor was Looney and then a mix of Jordan Bell and Nick Young. Significantly worse than any 5th guy the Rockets had on the floor it's their own fault Harden didn't go Elmer Fudd and hunt their ass
"In Game 7, Jordan Bell and Klay were straight up running into Harden while he was taking 3s and no call. Like I’m talking blatant hip check type defense (not dirty but clearly a fucking foul) and Scott just turns away.   That happened 3x btw. So that’s 9 FTs Harden never got to take which he damn well should have."
The last 10 finals featured Lebron or Jordan Bell
Fluid means they have identified guys they want in draft but are ready to Trade Down if they know they can get them later.  Why pay 7th pick money when you can pay 10th pick money and get another 2nd rd pick?  Jordan Bell about to be unemployed again.  Also could sign Obre then trade with a pick if the guy they want us in reach.  Fluid!  4D chess!
Would you rather have Ayton fused with Elfrid Payton or Giannis fused with Jordan Bell
"the raptors werent that good, i dont get all of you guys. by record, personnel, winning%, net rating (where suns were .4 better), the suns and raps were almost identical across the board.   The warriors without KD were curry, klay, iggy, draymond, bogut, looney, livingston, jordan bell, quinn cook, and alfonzo mckinnie. Half those guys were out of the league within a season. One of the top-heaviest rosters ever without their best player. Stop pretending the raps beat some goliath. It took the healthy raps 6 games, one where even klay didnt play, the other klay didnt play the 4th quarter and the raps won by 4. It's fucking ridiculous how much you all are defending that team, they simply were not that great."
"It literally was. The ""kd and klayless warriors that would slap this suns team"" lineup would have been curry, quinn cook, iggy, draymond, and kevon looney, with alfonzo mckinnie,  jordan bell, boogie, and livingston (averaging 4 pts/game in the playoffs) coming off the bench. Please shut the fuck up."
"That Jordan Bell game was insane, dude really looked like Prime Bron out there"
That Jordan bell thing was one of the most annoying things as a bulls fan literally not even good just on the warriors lol
"It’s chillin in my closet. Since Klay signed it, I got Jim Barnett, Jordan Bell, Shaun Livingston, Coach Kerr and Zaza to sign it. The magic is definitely gone, just look at the past two seasons for us. At this point I just want Steph and KD to sign it and I’ll put it in retirement."
Bogut did between-the-legs passes to Curry. Zaza and Jordan Bell did the same thing. Bogut may not have taught them directly though. They probably just saw him do it.
"LMAO. Klay was handchecking and harden went up with the three. That was counted a shooting foul all season. Jordan bell hand checked and he went up no call. You also ignore the threes on the other end with no call. “Weirdly emotional” my ass, you’re just wrong and you’re scared to admit it. The rockets got fucked that game. “What I miss in the houston era the most” lmao Uh huh. Shows how clearly biased you are towards him, nobody gives a fuck what weird gripes you have with hardens game. He was fouled and they didn’t call anything.  Look, if you think you know more then former and current NBA players, be my guest, but anyone who watched that game knows what happens.  I mean, you’re free to go through this even though I know you won’t  https://uproxx.com/dimemag/demarcus-cousins-warriors-rockets-game-7-referees-twitter-reaction/  These are live, unfiltered reactions from unbiased NBA personalities and several media personalities who don’t even like harden. But yeah you somehow know more then them after not even watching the game"
Ah yes maybe he shouldn’t have let jordan bell slap his fucking arm. Warriors fans will do anything but admit they got lucky
Jordan Bell attempted hotel prank of Mike Brown: https://www.knbr.com/2021/02/17/andrew-bogut-reveals-what-really-happened-in-jordan-bell-mike-brown-hotel-charge-scandal/
"I used to go to Taco Bell after school and would always see advertisement for the Hakeem vs. Shaq game.  I was disappointed when it was cancelled.  Not sure if it was because of a real injury or maybe too much pushback from the Players Union.  The Players Union was strongly against the possibility of a Magic vs. Michael 1 on 1 back in the late 80s.  Jordan didn't care about doing the game, but since Isiah was the head of the union and spoke publicly against it, Jordan suddenly acted interested and said Isiah was just jealous lol"
Center minutes on the last five NBA championship teams  2020 Lakers: JaVale McGee / Dwight Howard (16.6 / 18.9 mpg)  2019 Raptors: Serge Ibaka / Marc Gasol (27.2 / 24.9 mpg)  2018 Warriors: Zaza Pachulia / JaVale McGee / Jordan Bell (14.1 / 9.5 / 14.2 mpg)  2017 Warriors: Zaza Pachulia / JaVale McGee (18.1 / 9.6 mpg)  2016 Cavaliers: Tristan Thompson / Timofey Mozgov (27.7 / 17.4 mpg)
"I mean, yes almost all of them in the last two decades?  * Lakers started JaVale McGee with Dwight as his backup * Raptors started an old Marc Gasol who was making a lot of money, but was on a minimum and unplayable on the Lakers two seasons after * Warriors for their two most recent titles used some combo of Jordan Bell, Zaza Pachulia, Kevon Looney and JaVale * and going back to 15/16 the Cavs started Tristan Thompson  idk if you call this moneyball, but it's basically just spending your money in places where it is hardest to get production above replacement level. except for the really elite centers like Embiid and Jokic, the defense/rebounding/rim roll skillset is in such an over abundance right now"
"Maybe but doubtful right now. He couldn't even secure a roster spot over guys like Mychal Mulder, Damion Lee or Jordan Poole. For the Play-In round, they chose Gary Payton III, Smailagic and JORDAN FUCKING BELL over having Mannion on the bench.   He does seem to have great poise when he  was on the court though but its always been with/against scrubs. I feel like he's trying to play ""right"" and not make mistakes, instead of showing out so not really sure what is special about him yet. I hope I'm proven wrong though and he breaks out next season since GS really needs a solid backup PG for the second unit"
"Sure, and while I don't think I agree with Jalen's assertion of this being tokenism, that fact does give his argument the slightest amount of plausibility. That's all I'm saying!   And if we want to throw Jordan Bell on the team in an effort to disprove him, I think that would be hilarious."
"Even Salt Lake City?  I remember that a few years ago the Warriors had a bunch of time there, and a bunch of the players were trying to figure out something to do (because there's not much compared to other places).  They ended up going to an escape room, lol:  https://www.sfgate.com/warriors/article/warriors-curry-mocks-nightlife-backlash-slc-insta-12536656.php  &gt;Steph Curry mocks last year's 'nightlife' backlash with funny Salt Lake City Instagram  &gt;Who says Salt Lake City doesn't have #nightlife?  &gt;A year after the Warriors' ""nightlife"" comments lit up Twitter, Stephen Curry made light of the pseudo-controversy with a tongue-in-cheek Instagram post on Monday night. In the photo, the team poses at an escape room in Salt Lake City. The caption: #nightlife.  &gt;In case you missed last year's weakest Warriors controversy, here's what went down: During the Western Conference playoffs, ESPN asked the Warriors if they preferred the nightlife in Los Angeles or Utah during their between-games downtime.  &gt;""No comparison. There's no such thing, man,"" then-Warriors forward Matt Barnes said. ""There's no nightlife in Utah.""  &gt;**""The problem with Utah is that you're just sitting there and your mind is, like, dead**, because in L.A., you still got energy for the game,"" added Andre Iguodala. ""Because you're in L.A., you're like, 'Man, this is just the vibe in L.A.' but in Utah, it can kind of lull you to sleep.""  &gt;Soon after the story broke, ""nightlife"" started trending on Twitter. The ""Visit Salt Lake"" tourism bureau even shared a two-minute video highlighting the city's attractions called, ""There's Nothing to Do in Salt Lake.""  &gt;Luckily, it looks like the Warriors found some of the elusive Salt Lake City nightlife this year. Omri Casspi, Draymond Green, JaVale McGee (and his fanny pack), Nick Young, Zaza Pachulia, Jordan Bell and Andre Iguodala all appear in the escape room snap with Curry. Missing are Klay Thompson (probably playing ""Call of Duty"") and Kevin Durant (perhaps the photographer).  &gt;According to its website, the Escape Key has four different rooms with mad scientist lab, Sherlock Holmes, Russian spy and CSI themes. In case you were worried they didn't make it out, McGee posted proof that they did.  &gt;""The champs made it out the escape room,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""TeamWork make the DreamWork!"""
"That's a pretty flimsy basis for your argument. The Warriors didn't particularly care about their regular season campaigns from 2017-2019. You could see them experimenting and blowing too many games by keeping Jordan Bell in for extended spells that year and the likes of Cousins, Bogut and Jerebko the following year.  Steph has never had the kind of playoffs that KD had in 2021 and 2019, you can't just spin away peak performance of that sort away with regular season proofs."
"I hope Klay comes back 100% next year and the Splash Bros get to play together again.   But he's not wrong about you guys feeling the effects after KD left and Klay went down. All your big acquisitions these last couple years were trades not FA. D. Russell, Wiggins, and Oubre.   Wiseman was the reward for bottoming out. But the only guys you have that you guys drafted are Jordan Poole, Paschall, Mannion, and Smailagic. 3 being 2nd rounders. Then there's Looney who was there before KD and Bell who left and you guys brought back at the end if the season.   Paschall was solid his rookie year but regressed. Poole has some big games so hopefully he can turn into solid role player.   Lee, JTA, and Mulder were all undrafted and and started on 10 day or 2 way contracts.  The point is that they clearly felt the effects of the end of the super team. Whether it being not able to sign a big FA and having to trade for big named players or having to rely on your late draft picks to step up or having to look to g League or FA like Bazemore to fill out your roster cause of injuries."
"It's amazing how much of Harden's mindset is on drawing fouls. Best example I can give you is him pulling Jordan Bell when he was screening for Curry in 2018 WCF, Harden pulls Bell towards him making it look like a moving screen. Like serious creativity there, props to him. Harden would probably average 7 less points if refs didn't buy his bullshit"
"That's for a few reasons.    1. Players are more empowered in the NBA, enabling them to pressure their owners more easily. For they hyper empowered players, you're seeing the same trends that occur in the NBA. See: the current Aaron Rodgers situation, AB, or Leveon Bell.    2. An all star/all NBA caliber player is massive to a NBA franchise, they can literally control the game at both ends of the floor. While in football, the best skill position players get maybe 40 touches a game, and that's if their all world running backs. The only position that comes close to the floor impact of a Giannis/LeBron/cp3 is the quarterback, and they literally cannot play defense. This pushes for less emphasis on the players and more emphasis on the team. The size of the roster has the same effects.   3. Those franchises are all successful because they have great quarterbacks, which allows them to recruit talent. The same thing happened in the NBA, just look at the magnetism of free agents to Cleveland during the later LeBron years. When you have all world talent, all world talent is willing to come. Even then, tell me the last time a big name free agent was signed to the Packers.    4. The information debt accumulated in football is massive compared to basketball. We hear a lot about system in basketball, but it's miniscule compared to a football playbook. Even Tom Brady, who has seen more NFL plays than anyone else in NFL history, took a solid 7 weeks to click with his team and merge into a new system last year. In the NBA, systems aren't as much controlled by the coach, it is run by the personnel. Michael Jordan famously said ""I am the triangle."" and how many times have we heard the phrase LeBronBall? Even Steve Kerr's famous motion offense is predicated on Steph Curry running around like a bat out of hell. This makes switching in football really difficult, while switching teams in basketball much much easier in terms of production."
"Agree that CP3 was worse, but Iggy’s loss is extremely underrated due to that team’s lack of depth. Without him, Harden feasted on Jordan Bell and Nick Young. With him, they won convincingly despite Harden being lights out in Game 1.   KD may have done more down the stretch, but this was against the Bucks defense as opposed to the Warriors defense. Bron imo had a greater overall game."
The first Jordan bell clip is a clean block.
"Are you serious right now? You're so dead kid. You must be one of those Lakers fans that thinks championships are actually important, completely ignorant to the fact that any legendary player (Duncan anyone?) would take a 55 FG% than some useless jewelry ring anyday. You don't know anything about the PER valuations and the metrics used to accentuate intricate sample sets about autonomous principles that can be extracted to show that Kobe Bryant has never actually hit a game winner in his career. All his game winners are media hype tapes to sell shoes. Kobe is very fortunate that he's marked so well by Nike and the Lakers franchise. ESPN and the whole 'next Jordan' narrative has you thinking Kobe is clutch but he's not, every data point that was graphed on the Cartesian plane while prime factorization was allowed to exist in a null factor showed that Kobe continued to fail theses primitive tests. Studied statistical variations in geometric localities and each and every one of their correspondent asymptotic differentiations provided me with the conclusion that your so called Kobe is the worst clutch shooter in the NBA. Cosine functions developed at Princeton while combined with the Bell curve allows us to measure basketball production without affecting Higgs Boson-like particles that would otherwise exist in non-zero environments. And where do you think Kobe ranks on that scale? The bottom of the Bell Curve. They ran about ten thousand trials of the same repeating polymorphic routes emulating artificially generated synergy optimization and the Mamba was nowhere to be found in either planes. ""Eye tests"" are a layman's tool for avoiding thinking and this kind of narrow tunnel vision only exacerbates current falsifications that we can rely on such a poor method of extrapolation. I don't watch basketball but the fact of the matter is that I don't need to. It's all in the stats. Numbers don't lie. Your ""Kobe"" is just an average NBA player who gets an ungodly amount of touches thanks to his marketing. Kobe was never the best player in the league, nor even a top 250 player in the league at _any_ point in his career. I wish people understood more the numbers side of basketball and woke up and finally realized that this guy not only is overrated, but flat out isn't good at basketball in any way whatsoever."
"Let's agree to disagree on both points. In my opinion, LRMAM's defensive impact definitely was on par with Iggy's, and him being in that WCF series definitely would've given the Rockets a much needed wing depth boost, since in replacement of his minutes you guys ran with a lot more Gerald Green, Ryan Anderson, ang Joe Johnson than necessary IIRC, while Golden State ran a lot more Jordan Bell and Nick Young. Although for me, Iggy's IQ and offense gives him the edge. Him being gone for the rest of that series really stagnated the offense even more and forced the Warriors to give a lot of minutes to rookie Jordan Bell, who I think you'll agree was atrocious.  As for the refs, I've seen that video and the other commonly linked post that basically tries to analyze that game. Personally, had the refs been able to call everything right, it would've been a very tight game, as in a 2 point win either way, since I think ya'll got the shorter end of that stick but also believe that off ball fouls leading to foul trouble would've led to major tactical decisions by MDA and Kerr. Although it being a Scott Foster game definitely makes it very sus in my opinion."
"That 2019 Warriors team did *not* have a deep bench. Quinn Cook, Alfonzo McKinnie, Jonas Jerebko, Jordan Bell 🤮"
"Nobody is comparing it, but it's disingenuous to act like that series was even close when Iguodala played. Golden State smashed Houston in Games 1 and 3 with Iggy and when he got hurt his minutes went to players that either barely played or didn't play at all.  The Warriors were a superteam, they didn't have depth, all of sudden they went from Iguodala to rookie Jordan Bell or Kevon Looney."
Looney was great. Losing Iggy definitiv hurt considering the backups were a washed up Nick Young and a Rookie Jordan Bell
"There's nuance to it, though, it's not a straight like-for-like comparison. Nobody says Andre Iguodala is as good as Chris Paul, or that they were 100% equally as important to their respective teams.  The Warriors had a chance to essentially put the series to bed with Game 4 at home, but Iguodala was suddenly out and his 27 minutes largely went to Looney and Jordan Bell. And the Warriors blew a 12-point lead in the fourth quarter of G4 that drastically changed the series (2-2 as opposed to 3-1).  Iguodala was a net ratings god for that team; losing his minutes and having many go to Jordan Bell was hugely impactful considering G4 and G5 were nailbiters that they lost. There is a very good chance the Warriors win in 5, or at least come home for G6 up (rather than down) 3-2, if Iguodala wasn't out after three games."
"&gt;He was lethargic, lacked drive, made idiotic plays and was generally just a negative any time he was on the court.   So how was he better than MPJ?   &gt;Yet he managed to turn it around with the warriors, posting season high in fg% and 3PT% while playing great defense. He played smarter then he ever has, it’s not a coincidence that this is happening because of a change of team, it’s also a change of management and leadership.  He has better looks due to playing with Curry and has Draymond to guide him on defence other than that little has changed with Wiggins. Watching him brick that shot to advance into the playoffs was proof enough.  &gt;KAT lacks what it takes to be the 1st option on a winning team, the only time he was apart of one was when Butler came in as the head honcho.  Yeah man him not being able to win with Jordan Bell and Treveon Graham and Keita Bates Diop is proof that he lacks what it takes!"
"&gt;It’s not just about stats. Jokic gets those stats while making those around him better. KAT gets those stats but he doesn’t make any of his teammates better.   This is such a bs argument. Not even LeBron could make Treveon Graham,Jordan Bell,Jeff Teague and Noah Vonleh into serviceable players."
"Steph got mauled all series. No excuse for the refs though. They even let all the blatant illegal screens slip (the Jordan Bell one was just too much).   However, missing 27 in a row is just incredible. And they were up by double digits as well by halftime. Everything went wrong for HOU."
"It was worse, I remember Gerald Green pushing Curry on a drive right in front of the ref, perfect angle, and NO CALL. CP3 was pushing him every game, getting hand checked and grabbed by trash like Ryan Anderson, held by PJ Tucker who'd complain after the 100th hold is called for the first time, etc. In game 7 there is even a play where Harden pulls Jordan Bell to make it look like a moving screen."
Jordan Bell was such a lock down defender that whole series. Too bad he didn't work out.
Would anybody have watched if Jordan Bell had fouled out? NBA's hands were tied man
"Here's [that post](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8mzetu/bad_officiating_calls_in_warriorsrockets_g7/) about potential missed calls on both teams:  ------  Strap in boys, it's gonna be a ride. So I've basically reviewed the whole game last night, and here are the questionable plays which I thought should have been calls/were called wrongly.  #Calls going against Rockets:  1. [Wrong travelling call against Capela](https://streamable.com/cso98), didn't lift up his pivot foot.  2. [Slight push on PJ Tucker no call, KD gets the call on the other end](https://streamable.com/boqtv). Probably a superstar call.  3. [Harden might have gotten shoved in the back by Looney](https://streamable.com/7189z), no call.  4. [Capela called for a goaltend for what seemed to be a clean block](https://streamable.com/qtz8u).  5. [Harden fouled on the landing](https://streamable.com/4d9r6), no call. [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/s06jh)  6. [Harden fouled on three attempt](https://streamable.com/bzjys), no call. [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/alpcm)  7. [Ref disallows continuation on Harden's three](https://streamable.com/vhads). [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/lydp2)  8. [Eric Gordon fouled by Draymond](https://streamable.com/zynw6), no call.  #Calls going against Warriors:  1. [Klay gets called for an early 2nd foul which didn't look like much contact](https://streamable.com/e0s94), looked like ball just slipped out of EG's hands.  2. [Curry's hip gets pushed by Gerald Green](https://streamable.com/o4nk6), even falls on the ground. No call.  3. [Jordan Bell raked across the arm by Harden](https://streamable.com/s2n6m), no call. (pro tip: right click and select 1/4 speed to see the contact)  4. [Klay gets hand checked by Tucker and loses the ball](https://streamable.com/pqylu). No call. [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/j8f9c)  5. [KD gets pushed into Harden by Ryan Anderson](https://streamable.com/n27zm), foul on KD. Similar to [this play](https://streamable.com/nhcep), albeit less egregious by Anderson.  6. [Klay gets a point removed by Scott Foster](https://streamable.com/0nhtk).  A major theme which showed itself was the fact that Ryan Anderson literally (I'm not kidding) hand checked Curry every time he was switched onto him. And the Warriors forced that switch A LOT. Here's ALL the plays where Anderson guarded Curry:  https://streamable.com/el34r  https://streamable.com/vtmzu  https://streamable.com/uv829  https://streamable.com/9fqlg  https://streamable.com/junss  https://streamable.com/2peej  https://streamable.com/53mhy  https://streamable.com/cuojo  https://streamable.com/07r5o  Bonus Harden trying to draw foul when there was none &amp; just looking like a fool:  https://streamable.com/ca5v5  https://streamable.com/jffyc  Oh and, inb4 Rockets fans accuse me of bias again, and calling me a Warriors fan. Would a Warrior fan post these?  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8lyh34/ariza_gets_called_for_a_blocking_foul_on_durant/  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8ly16n/curry_draws_3_free_throws_from_capela/  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8lfvoo/draymond_going_back_to_his_bad_habits/  The entire game is freely available online, if you're so angry why don't you make your own compilation?

"The Jordan Bell “illegal screen” was an arm hook by Harden, who tried to bring both of them down. Love it when even the announcers are fooled by a flop."
With different ref Jordan bell would have been fouled out even if it was summer league
"Altman has consistently been able to get his talent to develop, was happy to see Pritchert and Bol Bol filling in the stats sheets to. But Honestly what the hell happened to Jordan Bell!"
"Yeah there comes a point where you realize the difference between the #1 and #2 all time human in any competitive sport is going to be incredibly close, just following the laws of the bell curve.  Nba players have 2 arms and 2 legs and are constrained by the same laws of physics.  To suggest one person is going to be 100% more valuable than another in a sport like basketball is stupid.  Usain Bolt was approximately 2-3% faster than the next fastest human to ever live, and that is fucking insane.  The answer between Jordan and Lebron is within those error bars."
Lol that was the supposed story with the Warriors buying the Jordan Bell pick
"It really is this lol, it’s just mind blowing to see the amount of people shit on everything Rosas does considering the roster he was given. Did they already forget what that pre trade deadline wolves looked like with Jordan bell, treveon Graham, Noah vonleh, Wiggins, and Teague looked like"
I really wanna just call him Jordan bell 2.0 for shits and giggles
"Man I fuckin loved Jordan Bell in college I thought he would be a high energy Pf that would get some lobs, outbacks rebounds and be a good shot blocker and he's just been nothing"
Jordan Bell was a guy I thought would create contract problems with the warriors when he was up for an extension. He is basically out of the league now.
This is great. You’d have thought Jordan Bell was a Draymond clone after that trade/pick
Jordan bell has good defense!!!
Hey let's go Jordan bell!!!!
"Jordan Bell vibes, people were legitimately crying   Every move top teams make people think it's gonna be some genius move  Actually think they legitimately wasted a 27th pick on a terrible fit, they don't need a scoring guard"
like jordan bell and paschall
Cash considerations &gt; Jordan Bell  I’m not afraid to speak the truth
"Are you serious right now? You're so dead kid.

Jordan Bell
At least Jordan Bell isn't going bald.
 That settles it Jordan Bell &gt; LeBron.
Ah Jordan Bell. I really thought he was going to be an absolute beast and everyone was a fool for not taking him in the 1st round.
"I mean Mccaw,Festus Ezeli, and Jordan Bell were all good contributors while they were here. Paschall too."
"I said stereotype. While in a lot of cases its not true (Eric Paschall and Jordan Bell), being OP is gonna be attached to us whether its factual or not. Every time we do the right move, its gonna be described as a blockbuster one like its KD all over again."
Isn’t this a lil early to crown gsw lmao? I get it these guys look good in summer leauge but people overreact so hard to gsw players. I remeber when people were similarly losing their minds over Jordan Bell and Eric Pachall’s potential
"Playing with high IQ guys like Curry, Klay, Green, Iggy, and if he doesn't go Jordan Bell on Kerr will help him a lot"
"Jordan Bell played 0 minutes in game 1 but played 17 minutes in game 4 and 14 minutes in game 5. Don’t act like the Rockets weren’t lucky or fortunate Iguodala got hurt. Iguodala’s impact on the game over Jordan Bell, while being super conservative, is at least 5 points which puts the game4 3point win and game5 4point win in serious jeopardy. Rockets we’re a great team but they did have some luck on their side."
Are you trying to reverse-jinx this into another Jordan Bell? 😂
Jordan Bell?
Damn that's no Jordan Bell
"And even today a lot of tweeners are kind of stuck. Jordan Bell is an athletic 6'8 center but he'll probably always be a benchwarmer because he just can't guard true 5s. Tweeners that make it work like Draymond, Millsap, etc are still pretty rare."
Two Jordan bell fouls on 3’s weren’t called and a Durant foul on the way up was counted as on the floor
I thought Jordan bell would be good ngl
"warriors had an injured team and still made the finals they had jordan bell starting and qiunn cook playing heavy minutes, and jonas and demarcus  and kevon looney , need a go on? klay was injured playing and broke down because of the heavy load , same with kevin   &amp;#x200B;  its not that hard to beat a injured team and giving your best 9 players heavy minutes to capitalize on that , it was basically stephen curry that series vs the raptors. Keep hyping them up tho , because in reality they are just role players lol"
"Not sure that's the right take.  I once heard this about Joe Piscopo:  ""Joe Piscopo let Eddie Murphy's success go to his head.""  I feel like in this case it's:  ""Jordan Bell let Durant/Curry/Thompson/Green/Iggy's success go to his head.""  Man was drafted into the dream team and won a ring as a rook. Felt like he never had the desire or work ethic to maximize his natural ability, which was relatively solid. He was athletic and could be a useful dunk/pass outlet, with a promising ceiling on D. Coulda, woulda, shoulda.   An NBA talent without an NBA work ethic or maturity level though. At least that's what it looked like from the outside. He did win a ring and play rotation minutes in the finals, so wasn't a total zero."
I still remember the hype behind Jordan Bell after being drafted and during his rookie year
"They filled the Kevin Durant hole with Andrew Wiggins. There's certainly room left over, but it's not like the hole is wide open. And at the same time they've filled the Jordan Bell, Jonas Jerebko, Alfonzo McKinnie, Quinn Cook, and Jacob Evans slots with Wiseman, Porter, Bjelica, Toscano-Anderson, and Poole. The bench has been upgraded. The Iguodala and Livingston holes still need filling, though."
"I'm pretty sure at one point when Curry had to sit in game 4, they played a lineup of Quinn Cook, Jordan Bell, McKinnie, Draymond, and one legged Boogie. Ugliest basketball ever"
Remember when Jordan Bell was yet another Warriors draft steal?
Random fun fact: Jordan Bell had the highest +/- in game 7.
"But you still have Wiseman, right? He's like DeAndre Ayton crossed with prime DeAndre Jordan crossed with prime Jordan Bell, right?"
Jordan Bell
"I think my HS team could beat Brad Wanamaker, Alen Smailagic, and Jordan Bell"
"But you have to agree that the Warriors were falling like bowling pins. Steph hand injury, KD Achilles, klay's acl tear. The rest of the squad was apart from Steph, Dray and Iggy were kinda scrubs, like Alfonzo McKinney, Jordan Bell, Jonas Jerebko or Quinn Cook. Out of those only Steph was a scoring threat. Not saying the Raptors didn't deserve it, but they were facing a diminished squad."
"Lol what? Are you talking about Jordan bells football like moving screen on harden to leave curry wide open? The others are absolutely fouls, jordan bell slapped his arm, reached in, klay reached in, you can’t do that. You can pretend to be smart and be like “well he’s just foul baiting so it’s fine” but the neutral announcers were going crazy and NBA players went on twitter to complain about the horrible officiating, so I think I’ll trust that over you"

Jordan bell slapped his arm
"Okay yeah great call on Jordan Bell, how could I forget about him lol. But Nwora and Bell were both drafted in the 2nd round and look where Bell is now.   You just don’t draft these types of guys in the lottery."
"Jordan Bell at 54 minutes in the 2018 Finals with the Warriors.  Nwora played a little bit for the Bucks as well, earlier in the run, but not in the finals."
And this wasn't even his low point of the night. He likened Kuminga to *checks notes* Jordan Bell of all people???  I love how ESPN keeps embarassing itself by pushing Perkins to the front. On the other hand ABC coverage was really good imo
He called my boy Jordan bell😂
Difference is work ethics. Jordan Bell got complacent just cause he was drafted on a championship team. Looney is a good example of a player who kept working on his game.
Jordan Bell was looking like he was gonna be a part of the Warriors dynasty contributing as a role player. Then he fucked up.
Jordan Bell was a 2nd rd pick and still has a strong chance to be a really good role player for a contending team.  His story is far from written
Jordan Bell was an unsuccessful project though he had good college stats. I just hope warriors don't screw up on Wiseman
Every dollar paid for Jordan Bell was worth it to see him throw himself a lob off the backboard in garbage time with a thirty point lead 😂
Wasn’t Jordan Bell actually good in his first year but then developed a bad attitude?
This the same guy that also wanted Jordan Bell
This the same guy that also wanted Jordan Bell
NBA champion Jordan Bell
Thats Jordan 'charge hotel porn to the coach' Bell
Lmao i was about to reply this. This is so reminiscent of the jordan bell thread
"Can’t forget to add when the bulls gave us Jordan Bell for cash considerations, remember how you guys were wyling out here?"
Every fanbase is and it’s obnoxious. I just like to remind people how *certain* they were that Jordan Bell was a steal of a pick for the Warriors
Like Jordan Bell
Perk’s player comparisons tonight:  -	Bill Russell -	Jordan Bell
Still laughing at Perk dropping in the Jordan Bell comparison.
Compared kuminga to Jordan bell ☠️
Perk compared Kuminga to Jordan Bell. 🤨
"I was talking to my dad and then Perkins started talking and I said ""This is the dumbest guy on ESPN"" then he compared Kuminga to Jordan Bell lmao"
Perk said he didn’t like the Kuminga/Jaylen Brown comparison and thought Jordan Bell was a better one.
I know Schmitz probably shit himself when Perk said jordan bell
Perk still on mic talking Jordan Bell LOL
Perk: Jonathan Kuminga: poor man's Jordan Bell
Dude jordan bell holy shit imagine drafting jordan bell top 7 in one of the most stacked drafts ever I may piss myself laughing
“Kuminga reminds me of Jordan Bell”- Perkins  Lmaoooooooooo Get this dude of my TV
Jordan Bell? Lol get Kendrick out of there
MAN SAID JORDAN BELL LMAO
Perkins is so garbage. I swear he has no idea who these players are. Kuminga is raw but he does not play like Jordan Bell at all
Did he compare him to Jordan bell????
Lol perk just compared him to Jordan Bell
Jordan bell???
Not sure you want to be compared to Jordan Bell lmao
Perkins on picks 1-6: “this guy is an automatic first ballot hall of famer.”  Perkins on pick 7: “this guy reminds me of Jordan bell.”
JORDAN FUCKING BELL LMAO
"Bruh did Perk just compare this dude to Jordan Bell, and mean it as a positive?"
How y’all feel about Kenny Perk comparing this guy to Jordan Bell?
Damn we went from Bill Russell comparisons to Jordan Bell. Nothing but hot takes from Perk
"I’m not a big conspiracy guy but I’ll die on these hills   I hated the KD Warriors so much but Game 4 of the 2017 NBA Finals was the most blatantly obvious rigged game of all time , the Warriors were on the verge of a playoff sweep , there was an article somewhere before the game happened highlighting how the NBA would lose tons of revenue if a game 5 in Oracle arena didn’t happen. And Game 4 had the most one sided calls we’ve ever seen. Think Cleveland was almost at 90 points in the first half. Just despicable stuff  Game 7 Houston/Golden State in 2018 was the worst reffed game in the modern era, considering how high the stakes were. Those uncalled Jordan Bell moving screens. Those non shooting foul calls on those Harden threes. Nasty."
"First wisemans defence is fixed by the standard drop in rookie fouling. His offence will come. He's more efficient at the rim than Ayton or bam. Albeit on lower volume. Personally I think being unable to play basketball for 10 months before his nba debut really hurt him. Including not having access to basketball facilities or a personal trainer for 8 of those months. But again that's just me.  Poole averaged 14 pts to end the year. It is not unreasonable to expect a 4pt bump in pts and a 2 PT jump in assists as he takes on a larger role. Rebounds is honestly irrelevant.  Wiggins has shown improvement with HS including going from a bad defender to an elite one. A bad shooter to a good one. An inefficient iso scorer to top 20 in the league. And like top 10 when you put in volume requirements that eliminate guys like KD. His biggest weakness is his handle but he's training with one of the best dribbling coaches in the league this offseason and that will probably give a solid bump to his efficiency and playmaking as well if not a huge jump. But any improvement in that regard massively helps the warriors.  Also ""make"" the first round. We had the same record as the Mavs, or the blazers when steph played. We were just 2-9 when he missed games. Can't really make the playoffs like that. And either way even if we don't get improvements out of any of those guys we are still a better team as we replaced wanamaker with Poole, Mulder with Klay and Bazemore with OPJ. And Jordan Bell with Bjelica."
i think last year they did sign jordan bell in the middle of the season after someone got injured but im too lazy to google it
"warriors just need to bring everyone back, go get zaza and jordan bell as well"

Of course it was! Just like the Jordan Bell comparison the mic caught him laughing about after.
"I guess my main thing is that COVID is still going to be a thing, injuries will definitely still be a thing and the Wizs have made huge strides in adding to our depth.   When COVID hit us last year, we signed Jordan Bell to a 10-day just to have enough people to play"
"He also compared Jonathan Kuminga to Jordan Bell and then when he thought the microphones were muted he laughed and said ""hurr hurr, you like that Jordan Bell (comparison)?"""
I wanna look like Jordan Bell

"McCaw, Bell, Paschall...good thing Jordan Poole snuck into the very end of the first round."
Or Jordan bell.  If the goal is soaking up some regular season minutes I'd rather have a guy fighting to stay in the league with young legs than someone past his prime who was a questionable team player in his prime (infamous for hunting rb's taking them from his own guys... Which is the exact opposite of what you want with Westbrook)
"Well, but it also makes every player better at the time huh? I remember when we signed Jerebko and I had no clue how he played but by the comments it felt like we had got another star, same for that Jordan Bell buy from Chicago, people were mad at the Bulls for it lmao"
"Warriors second round pick. It's a tale as old as time.   Rookie year: Shit, this kid can *play*. Fucking Warriors, light years ahead amirite?   Sophomore year: GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER JORDAN BELL FUCK YOU"
"Jalen Johnson, BJ Boston, Jordan Clarkson, Aaron Gordon, Jordan Bell, Trey Lyles, JJJ, etc. There were a bunch of NBA guys there."
"Don't you think Game 7 is a pretty important game to not shit the bed in? The Blazers didn't put the Nuggets away in the first six games, so I don't see how it's excusable to play terribly in an elimination game.  &gt;Oh no, he lost to a team with 3 all stars as a lone injured all star without his 2nd best player   If he's injured, he shouldn't be playing. It's not an excuse for 2016 Steph, and it's not an excuse for Dame either. He averaged 22 points on bad efficiency against the hobbled Warriors with no depth and no KD. We started Jordan Bell, Alfonso McKinnie, Andrew Bogut, and Damian Jones at different points in that series. Klay also shot like shit that series. It's not like he was expected to win, but he could've at least put up a fight instead of letting Steph completely crush him pretty much single handedly."
[I remember Jordan Bell did it and Kerr chewed him for it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L663X_zhUS0)
"Don't worry they're light-years ahead! By the way, are mccaw, looney and Jordan bell stars yet?"
"And got swept by the Warriors without KD in a series where Jordan Bell, Bogut, Damian Jones and Afonzo McKinnie started at least one game each lol"
"""There are still teams who draft a Bowie over a Jordan (i.e. bigs with potential over thrilling wings). Darko over Melo rings a bell for me. As Wolff asserts, versatility is, indeed, coveted.""  Eh, the Darko/Melo draft was 12 years after the article, which is closer to that era than the draft we just had 18 years since. I wouldn't say that teams making this kind of error is current events."
"Per IG, Simmons, Rondo, Jordan Clarkson, Justise Winslow, JJJ, Jarred Vanderbilt, Aaron Gordon, Jordan Bell, Brandon Clarke, BJ Boston were at the most recent run, and Michael Beasley, Lonnie Walker, Ja, Maxey, and Bazely have gone to other ones."
"Nah, they're playing vs other pros. Jalen Johnson, Jarred Vanderbilt, Jordan Clarkson, Aaron Gordon, Rondo, Justise Winslow, Trey Lyles, JJJ, Jordan Bell, and Brandon Clarke were at the last run with BJ and Simmons."
jordan bell is an UFA iirc.  I'd rather have him.
Throwback to Jordan bell throwing it off the backboard and yamming it
"Jordan Bell doesn't even come close to approximating Draymond's impact by any meaningful metric. Draymond's poor scoring limits his offensive contributions, but no one on the 15-21' Warriors provides nearly the same lift to Curry's scoring efficiency as him because he's an elite passer with great vision; it's not just about intangibles. Tons of players have been on the Warriors only one non-MVP has his kind of impact metrics. (Klay's doesn't even come close).    In his prime he was an even better defender and shot 39% from 3. DPOY-level defense, elite passer and decent stretch big is definitely a star level player who would be valuable to every team, especially those that are already good."
UFA Jordan Bell + Cle's frp &gt; Steven Adams
"Omri Casspi got traded twice by the Kings before all the items in the first trade were conveyed.  He and a protected first round pick were traded to the Cavs for JJ Hickson. That pick got passed around and never conveyed because the Kings kept sucking enough to finish below the protection threshold. Casspi made his way back to the Kings via free agency after a few years. Then he was traded again in the DeMarcus Cousins trade. The pick eventually turned into a 2nd round pick that the Bulls sold to the Warriors, who drafted Jordan Bell with it."
"I’m curious, didn’t Golden State with Steph + Klay + Dray with a worse spacing AND arguably worse depth take arguably the best defensive team in the past decade to 6 games in the Finals (and almost to 7)? Not to mention they made it there going 5-0 without Cousins and KD prior to the Raptors series?   That Golden State team played all of Jonas Jerebko, Alfonzo McKinnie, Andrew Bogut, Jordan Bell and Quinn Cook actual 4th quarter minutes of a Finals game. Is this Warriors team bad enough to do THAT? Or did I mention that Looney was the only other player other than the Splash Bros to even have a league average TS% that series out of everyone that averaged double digit minutes?  The current Warriors team as they stand have a better 6th man, a better starting small forward, AND more spacing than that 2019 Warriors team that made the Finals. The only thing that the non-KD 2019 Warriors have over this current Warriors is pre-injury Klay and experience. We even have a good enough package to trade for another star in case things don’t work out. Yet “worst situation in the league for a star”? Like that’d be worse than Zion or Luka’s? C’mon now."
[Jordan Bell off the backboard vs Dallas](https://youtu.be/L663X_zhUS0)
"Didn't LeBron said ""its not over till its over"" or something like that when jordan bell did the same thing ? Russ is an emotional lesbian"
"[Jordan Bell did one when he was a rookie, and it caused a ton of drama and he got benched for a bit because of it](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/jordan-bells-garbage-time-dunk-needs-no-apology-from-steve-kerr-or-anyone-else/)"
lmao Jordan Bell out of the league damn
"Portland could sure use him! And Payton Pritchard. And Dillon Brooks. Maybe some Chris Boucher and Jordan Bell as well.  If I'm gonna watch us get blown out by 30 points, I can at least watch my Ducks get minutes!"
"the ""lol bulls just traded the second draymond for cash considerations"" legend Jordan Bell"
"To make an NFL analogy, the Jordan Bell pick reminds me a lot of the CEH pick by the Chiefs. Everyone loved it and there were lots of ""the best team just got even better"" reactions, but ended up being a bad pick."
"The Bulls still deserved to be clowned for it, do I need to tap the “the problem was not missing out on Jordan Bell specifically the problem was selling draft picks as a young rebuilding team instead of using them to acquire potential talent for aforementioned young rebuilding team” sign again?"
"Ah yes. Warriors legend Jordan ""charge hotel adult movies to the assistant coach"" Bell"
I drank the Jordan Bell kool aid good
"I pointed out an obvious carry on a highlight during preseason and I was definitely downvoted for it. I think it was Jordan Bell, but he crossed a dude and got the dunk.   I just think, “how is a defender supposed to have any chance when a player can dribble in one direction, palm the ball mid air, and change the direction?” We talk about it being an offensive players league but few people seem to mention carries when they bring up this point."
Jordan Bell better be taking notes
"In the 2018 playoffs there was a play where it looked like Jordan Bell did a moving screen on Harden into the first row while Curry hit a 3. The refs didn't call it and I thought the W's totally dodged one. On the replay, Harden grabbed Jordan and carried him backwards. I originally thought it was an incredible no-call. In hindsight, I think that should be foul at the least"
Can't believe Jordan Bell is out of the league
"I have many. cam payne, jae crowder, jordan poole, jusuf nurkic, jj barea, pat bev, deandre jordan, james harden, kyle kuzma, raja bell, &amp; dahntay jones."
"LeBron and Steph. Born in the same hospital should play on the same team. We'll give the Lakers Jordan Bell since they like centers, and a finals MVP in Andre Iguodala, I'm sure he'll understand."
Ah yes and Jordan bell is better than Charles Barkley because winning in a team sport is the only way to evaluate players!
"Iggy's going to do what he did last time he was on the Warriors, which is take it easy, protect his body, turn it on occasionally to remind people he still can, and then be spectacularly useful in the playoffs, even if he's in street clothes.  Man spent fifteen seconds talking to *Jordan Bell* and turned him into the greatest defender in the world for the next play. *Jordan Bell*."
"After years of carrying random guys like Damian Jones, Anderson Varejao, Jordan Bell, and Alen Smailagic on the team it appears that the Warriors have decided fuck centers."
this subs hard on for jordan bell his rookie year is pretty hilarious in hindsight.
"Uhhh a starter and a HOFer’s son with his namesake. If you don’t know Jordan Bell you simply just didn’t watch the Warriors Superteam in the regular season, if you don’t know Mychal Mulder I don’t blame you, but if you don’t know Avery Bradley or Gary Payton you just don’t know basketball."
"Jordan Bell had two critical Zaza screen assists to Curry in game 7 2018 wcf, give credit where it's due"
"mychal mulder who is named after klay's dad, jordan bell who gsw drafted back in 2017 and was a minor contributor on their last 2 playoff runs but was let go because he lacked discipline or something.  brought back on a two-way for a few days at the end of last season and signed to a training camp contract (but probably not for serious consideration for a roster spot)."
Definitely pulled a Jordan Bell am I right? Lol
THE WARRIORS DRAFTED JORDAN BELL? HOW DO THEY KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT?
"This is a serious question, but what is Jordan Bell good at?"
"Not sure about that lol. JTA and Lee will take Curry and Draymonds spot. Our 2nd team will probably be Chiozza, Mulder, Bjelica, Payton II, Jordan Bell.  4/5 are competing for the 15th spot lol"
Jordan Bell has had multiple conference finals appearances and a ring. Bell &gt; Doncic?
Jordan Bell had less overall hype than Paschall but performed worse. I'd say there was a bigger gap between Bell and fanbase delusions than paschall.
"I can't believe I'm saying this, but I almost want to keep Jordan Bell over Bradley/GPII, just to gave someone else who is capable of rebounding and guarding in the post."
You’re scheduled between festus Ezeli and the one quarter of Jordan bell
wait Jordan Bell is back on the warriors???
Jordan Bell honors for game 41 🔥
"Recent: Porzingus, Oubre, Jordan Bell, Thomas Robinson, Jerome Robinson   2000s edition: Antoine Walker, Raef Lafrentz, Pat Garrity, Stromile Swift, Hakeem Thabeat, Emeka Okafor, Sean May, Chris Duhon."
Wiseman the most overrated NBA player since Jordan Bell
You know who this team is missing.    Jordan Bell 💀
Jordan Bell had his moments.
"But I'm not really over-valuing them because they have no value now. But plugged into our team, deep in the playoffs, they did come up big in the biggest of moments. Don't get me wrong, they didn't save the game or anything. But Jordan Bell had to guard Harden at times and did a solid job. McCaw had to fill in for KD and it also didn't hurt us. Having guys who can start or be solid pieces is amazing for rookies deep in the playoffs. It just doesn't happen and those guys showed up. But my point was that they're NOT quality players. So there was something about our system that made them work."
"&gt; This is probably statistics noise, but a case can be made that late first round picks get picked up by play-off teams, thus landing in a place where they have a better chance at developing than say.. Minnesota or Sacramento (sorry, I had to).  From a Warriors perspective (more than a playoff team over the last several years) it's a pretty interesting take. Look at who we picked:  We have Jordan Poole at 28th who is looking to become a real NBA contributor and a possible 6th man of the year candidate. But the more interesting thing is guys like Jordan Bell (38) who is garbage now but was useful for us in the WCF and Finals in his rookie year. Damion Jones (30) who was never useful in the playoffs but definitely had a window where he was looking like he could be a solid guy for us. Patrick McCaw (38) who was clearly a playoff contributor when KD was hurt he had to start many deep playoff games and Finals in his rookie year and delivered. Useless now wherever he is. Kevon Looney (30) is our starting Center and was our best center option against James Harden and other teams who switched everything making traditional centers unusable. Draymond Green (35) don't need to say much there. My point being the guys that were pretty good for us, left and did nothing. I can't think of any of these guys doing anything beyond what they did for us while contending."
Remember when people said this about Jordan Bell? Lol
"Man, it’s so great the center position has returned to a point where we can have these discussions. There were years when Deandre Jordan and Tyson Chandler were the best bigs in the game and it would be a guard driven league for years to come. Basketball, like everything is cyclical. It’s like that period in the NFL when there were no great bell cow RBs and people just assumed there never would be again. Then you get LeVeon, Elliott and a slough of other dudes.   Personally, the center position is my favorite and Joker is my favorite player for really redefining the position. He’s doing things that have not really ever been done at the position. He can pass and handle, while being a huge brute that can play with his back to the basket. It is impossible to double team Joker. The Suns were able to guard him very capably with basically just Ayton and that really slowed down the Nuggets who depend on getting great looks off Jokic’s superior passing.  Meanwhile, Embiid is a marvel. The fact he continues to improve while collecting injuries like baseball cards is nuts and probably unsustainable. That said, when he is healthy, I don’t think there is a more unstoppable low post force. As a Heat fan, I can say we really struggle with Embiid, but honestly with Ben present, there are ways to defend the Sixers that wouldn’t exist if you had a more traditional point. He’s just so big and powerful and he can defend his position and the paint at an elite level. He’s just a monster and he can still stretch the floor to keep people honest.   I’m going to say Joker just because I love his game so much. He, like the best point guards and distributors, makes everyone around him a better basketball player. You just have to be able to play off-ball with Joker because he is such an amazing passer. I can’t wait to see Embiid with a traditional point guard, because I don’t think he will be able to be hammered so hard in the paint. There could potentially be someone at the top of the key willing to stretch the floor and punish teams for sinking down on him. That is something he has never really had unless Ben is off the court and it will be fun to watch.   That said, I would say Embiid is a more physically imposing player and a highly skilled big, but I think Joker does more in terms of contributing to the wins his team accumulates. It’s close in that regard, but they are also really different players completely. I would say, that the only player that is maybe a better offensive player in the entire league is Harden or Durant, but Harden can’t post all five guys on the court up effectively and Durant can’t pass as well as Joker. Also, neither of those two guys are 7-feet tall and 300ish pounds. Joker is as effective getting offensive rebounds down low as he is leading a fast break. He’s absolutely nuts and just a different kind of dude.   The Denver Nuggets offense reminds me of a solar system where Jokic is the Sun and everyone just runs around him coming off screens and all sorts of things and the Sun is just shooting it’s light rays to the depths of the solar system, finding anything that can be touched by its rays. It’s a weird metaphor I guess, but it’s why I love watching him. He’s like 300-pound Steve Nash."
"Huh? The warriors were running jordan bell, Quinn Cook, and Alfonso Mckinnie heavy minutes in the finals lol, no one outside of lebron would've been expected to be competitive in a finals series with that team lol  While I agree steph could've played better in the last game, to say that the last 3 was pretty open is straight stupid, he's running off a screen with a guy right on his back, 2 in front of him and a weird pass"
2016: Damian Jones becomes Deyonta Davis. This is a wash.  2017: Jordan Bell technically becomes Jawun Evans. This is probably a downgrade.  2018: Jacob Evans becomes Dzanan Musa. This is probably a wash  2019: Jordan Poole becomes Keldon Johnson. This is probably a downgrade.  2020: James Wiseman becomes Lamelo Ball. This is definitely an upgrade at this point in their respective careers.
"Jordan Bell!!! i got in the hype train of cash consideration jokes, the self lob vs Dallas  and really liked charisma of this guy"
"do they just change the roster on a weekly basis or something, i knew nba champion jordan bell had been named to the team but that was November 15 https://www.usab.com/basketball/players/mens/b/bell-jordan.aspx"
"Well also they old. Dwight doesn't look like he gives a shit anymore, he doesn't have that fire that he had in his first second stint with the Lakers (y'all know damn well what I'm talking about)   The honest truth is Deandre is ok to start for 4 or so minutes, but the Lakers really need someone who's young athletic and agile, like Jordan Bell to come off the bench to do a lot of the dirty work defensively that LeBron, AD and Melo don't want to do.   The Lakers should also try and get Torey Craig or Garrett Temple onto the team, just to try and fill out that wing."
jordan bell
"And Pat McCaw, and Brandon Rush, and Jordan Bell, just a murder's row of deep talent on the Warriors during their run"
"&gt; The 2018 Rockets are the greatest team to never win a title, I’ve gone back and watched some games from them and the Harden+CP backcourt is on the same level as Curry+Klay IMO  Hard disagree.  Prime Nash/Amare/Marion/Barbosa/Diaw/.  Throw in Jalen Rose, Kurt Thomas, James Jones, Raja Bell.  Guy went to jail for fixing games against us vs the Spurs multiple times.  We were the best team in the league, everybody knew it.  Throw in Prime Barkley/KJ/Majerle/Danny Ainge losing the prime Jordan Bulls thanks to a last second three by Paxson.  Kevin Johnson probably the most under rated PG in history.  He had several 20/10 seasons.  Which at the time was unheard of.  Barkley won league MVP and the Suns had a better record than the Bulls that year."
"For someone who usually values high IQ, Nate Duncan is always weirdly low on Looney. I remember during the 18 WCF he said Jordan Bell was more important/should play more at center than Looney. Bell did an excellent job but Loon was still doing better than him on Harden/CP3"
Jordan Bell &gt; LeMelo
reminder warriors fans thought jordan bell would be the next draymond and damian jones would be festus without the exploding knees
i got a fever…and the only prescription is more Jordan Bell
"Are you serious right now? You're so dead kid. You must be one of those Lakers fans that thinks championships are actually important, completely ignorant to the fact that any legendary player (Duncan anyone?) would take a 55 FG% than some useless jewelry ring anyday.  You don't know anything about the PER valuations and the metrics used to accentuate intricate sample sets about autonomous principles that can be extracted to show that Kobe Bryant has never actually hit a game winner in his career. All his game winners are media hype tapes to sell shoes. Kobe is very fortunate that he's marketed so well by Nike and the Lakers franchise.  ESPN and the whole 'next Jordan' narrative has you thinking Kobe is clutch but he's not, every data point that was graphed on the Cartesian plane while prime factorization was allowed to exist in a null factor showed that Kobe continued to fail theses primitive tests. Studied statistical variations in geometric localities and each and every one of their correspondent asymptotic differentiations provided me with the conclusion that your so called Kobe is the worst clutch shooter in the NBA.  Cosine functions developed at Princeton while combined with the Bell curve allows us to measure basketball production without affecting Higgs Boson-like particles that would otherwise exist in non-zero environments. And where do you think Kobe ranks on that scale? The bottom of the Bell Curve. They ran about ten thousand trials of the same repeating polymorphic routes emulating artificially generated synergy optimization and the Mamba was nowhere to be found in either planes.  ""Eye tests"" are a layman's tool for avoiding thinking and this kind of narrow tunnel vision only exacerbates current falsifications that we can rely on such a poor method of extrapolation. I don't watch basketball but the fact of the matter is that I don't need to. It's all in the stats. Numbers don't lie.  Your ""Kobe"" is just an average NBA player who gets an ungodly amount of touches thanks to his marketing. Kobe was never the best player in the league, nor even a top 250 player in the league at any point in his career. I wish people understood more the numbers side of basketball and woke up and finally realized that this guy not only is overrated, but flat out isn't good at basketball in any way whatsoever."
"He did that to Jordan Bell once too. LeBron threw Bell to the ground, Bell got called for the foul.  Can't find a clip of it but can find that it happened on the 3rd of June 2018."
"Lmao Nets fans hyping Claxton up is exactly like how we hyped Jordan Bell up. Please dont actually act like Millsap will make a difference. If anything, dude should be out of the rotation.  Joe Harris? The one who Nets fans on r/gonets cursed at in the playoffs?   ""Not indicative of anything"" Lmao please, go and see how you guys were acting in r/gonets before the game. Nets fans were acting like they were gonna win for sure. If Nets got the W, you wont be saying it's ""not indicative of anything"". Stop this clownery lol"
"Not quite the same when the other guys on the floor aren't Quinn Cook, Alfonzo McKinnie, Boogie on one leg, Looney, Jonas Jerebko, Jordan Bell, Iguodala, and the shell of Shaun Livingston."
"It's not as easy to box-and-1 Steph when he doesn't have Alfonzo Mckinnie, Quinn Cook, Jonas Jerebko, Jordan Bell and Boogie out there"
Jordan Bell in shambles.
Can we change Chiozza with Jordan Bell? Bell is already in Santa Cruz so I know it's possible. At the very least we have another RIM protector that already knows the GSW system like Looney instead of Curry's Ditto copy over here.
"Nah.. Jordan Bell couldn't defend 1-4. For all his athleticism, he didn't have that lateral movement to play in the perimeter. And he didn't have the size to play in the paint.   Kuminza, from whatever little Ive seen, looks like he can really hound the wing players. And is just at another level of athleticism."
It's because Kuminga is better at the game of basketball than Jordan Bell which is more valuable to teams looking for good basketball players.
"Yes, age is a **huge** factor when it comes to drafting. Jordan Bell was 23 when he was drafted, and basically means that he doesn't have much upside as a result. Kuminga's very young, young enough that he was supposed to be in the 2022 draft but reclassified to be drafted a year earlier.    Kuminga is also just way more athletic than Bell."
Jordan bell cannot defend 1-4
"Jordan Bell had the skills of a big in the body of a wing. Kuminga has actual wing skills, which means his ceiling is significantly higher. He's also a much smoother and better athlete than Bell is, who struggled with lateral motion and wasn't actually a great switch defender."
Jordan bell bites on literally every fake in his first 2 years man   It was free points for the other team
Jordan Bell is in the G League.   Kuminga's athleticism is really impressive and he has much better wing skills with potential to grow a lot with age.
Jordan Bell is in the G League
"To be fair i thought he meant Jordan ""charge hotel adult movies to the assistant coach"" Bell."
He’s a bit better than Jordan bell lol
But we got Jordan Bell for pennies to the dollar. It wasn’t like we gave up much for him.  And I think Poole is better than Keldon Johnson and I love Keldon Johnson.
"Come on, man, Jordan Bell scored five points a game. Poole's not shooting it well, but he's a 30 MPG starter on the best team in the league, it's not even remotely the same."
Warriors fans are notorious for over hyping their young dudes. Remember Jordan Bell?
"The rookies are great but they haven't been making the difference this season. It's all OPJ, Bjelica, GP2 and Iguodala. Massive step up over Bazemore, Oubre, Jordan Bell, Mulder, Paschall, Smailagic."
I was thinking last night about how the Warriors used Jordan Bell in a simple role and he looked like a stud. Kuminga could fill that exact same role but look like even more of a stud.
"Dame and CJ are not thinking when they said they would like to play with Draymond because neither have good off ball movement. If they are willing to move off ball for Draymond, then they should at least be able to show it.  The real problem with Blazers is that they suck defensively because  1. Their back court is undersized and bad at defense 2. Their front court is meh defensively. This issue was exposed in 2019 WCF against the Warriors. This was the Blazers best chance to win, KD was injured and at this point Warriors starting center was Jordan Bell and the bench consisted of Alfonso Mckinney, Jonas Jerebko, Quinn Cook each averaging over 12+ minutes. Blazers back court are not built for playoffs. When was the last time double guard centered lineups won a ring. 2015 Warriors because Klay plays real defense. If Klay's defense was on the level of Curry, then they wouldn't have gotten very far either."
"Our bench was ASS after the first year. Jonas Jerebko, Jordan Bell, jeeeeezus"
"Dame got swept in 2019 WCF by Warriors without Durant, with fken Jordan Bell as there starting Center. They had Alfonso Mckinney, Jonas Jerebko, and Quinn Cook off the bench averaging 12+ minutes per game. Dame is the biggest playoff joke I have watched. At least Harden came close to beating the Warriors. Dame got fken wrecked every time."
"Jordan Bell kind of was the same - high risk high reward. He washed out because he didn't put his  heart into improving and he was kind of an idiot outside of basketball (putting a 5k bill on Mike Brown's tab comes to mind).  We also have JTA and Damion Lee still, but I don't know how high their ceilings get."
"I think most of our bench from back then is out of the league right now.  McKinney, Jarebko, Jordan Bell, Cook, Boogie, Livingston, Jacob Evans"
"Holy smokes you are special.  First off if you don't understand why FG% is useless while comparing efficiency and why TS% is a better metric then you already exposed yourself.  Klay was out in game 3 and curry scored 47. Are you sure YOU watched the series? Accusing me of not knowing the details, fucking hilarious.  My bandwagon flair is a fucking joke, while pointing that out you again fucked up. I dont even live in the Americas, i had to wake up at 4am in the morning to watch those matches. Fun times.  30.5 points at .598 TS and 35 at .477. It's not that hard to see which one was better.  If you think quinn cook, bogut, Livingston, mckinnie, jordan bell, jerebko where anything but a g league squad  and were much better than the cavs in 2015 then idk what to tell you."
"Jordan Bell too, I just watched a game."
"If only this was possible, Warriors would have done it with Looney and Jordan Bell 3 years ago"
"Hmm, nbot sure why it might have returned that. I think first think I'd check is if you're able to run any player (try with a rookie, they have less games and it'll go quicker). If that returns actual output then I'm not sure what to think.  But I ran Klay's data to check/ for you and got this:  | Rank   | Player    | Assists| |:-----------|------------:|:------------:| | 1 | Stephen Curry | 187 | 2 | David Lee | 169 | 3 | Draymond Green | 162 | 4 | Harrison Barnes | 97 | 5 | Kevin Durant | 81 | 6 | Andrew Bogut | 75 | 7 | Andre Iguodala | 72 | 8 | Marreese Speights | 56 | 9 | Zaza Pachulia | 50 | 10 | David West | 42 | 11 | Shaun Livingston | 40 | 12 | Carl Landry | 38 | 13 | Brandon Rush | 35 | 14 | Festus Ezeli | 30 | 15 | Kevon Looney | 27 | 16 | JaVale McGee | 25 | 17 | DeMarcus Cousins | 20 | 18 | Jeremy Tyler | 14 | 19 | Omri Casspi | 13 | 20 | Nate Robinson | 13 | 21 | Quinn Cook | 12 | 22 | Dorell Wright | 11 | 23 | Jonas Jerebko | 11 | 24 | Jordan Bell | 10 | 25 | Charles Jenkins | 10 | 26 | Jermaine O'Neal | 9 | 27 | Patrick McCaw | 8 | 28 | Dominic McGuire | 8 | 29 | Alfonzo McKinnie | 7 | 30 | Damian Jones | 7 | 31 | Richard Jefferson | 6 | 32 | James Michael McAdoo | 6 | 33 | Jarrett Jack | 6 | 34 | Leandro Barbosa | 6 | 35 | Jordan Crawford | 6 | 36 | Monta Ellis | 5 | 37 | Chris Wright | 4 | 38 | Nick Young | 4 | 39 | Ekpe Udoh | 4 | 40 | Damion Lee | 4 | 41 | Ian Clark | 3 | 42 | Matt Barnes | 3 | 43 | Mickell Gladness | 3 | 44 | Andris Biedriņš | 2 | 45 | Anderson Varejão | 2 | 46 | Justin Holiday | 2 | 47 | Steve Blake | 2 | 48 | Jason Thompson | 2 | 49 | Ish Smith | 2 | 50 | Mikki Moore | 1 | 51 | Hilton Armstrong | 1 | 52 | Kwame Brown | 1"
"I'd probably keep him at least until we see what Klay comes back like. If it looks like you can make one more finals with this group you trade him, if not good to have someone to maybe try to reload around.  Either way that ain't Jordan Bell."
Oladipo Randle and Giannis  Also Jabari Parker and Jordan Bell would’ve made me go broke
i always thought it was so annoying when a dude is shooting a corner 3 by the opposing bench and those dudes just stand up and scream in his ear right behind him  &amp;#x200B;  jordan bell did that shit all the time
"Nah the talent differential wasn't as bad as people remember in that series  Harden was the MVP that year and Chris Paul was probably a top 10 player, maybe not as good as Steph and KD on paper but much closer than what any duo at the time could come   And the Rockets also were deeper, the Warriors gave Jordan Bell minutes in game 7"
I was a fan of Cash Considerations until he got traded for Jordan Bell
Same people who acted like the bulls trading Jordan bell to the warriors for cash broke the league lol when Jordan bell had that great pre season game this sub was full of “lol bulls” and “wow bulls just made the warriors so much better”
This has Jordan Bell off the backboard vibes.
"""The Grizzlies (37-33, same record as the Warriors) beat the Kings tonight, which means Sunday’s MEM-GSW game will determine which team finishes in 8th place, with the right to fly to the 7th place team’s homecourt and battle for the official No. 7 seed in the playoffs, probably on Tue 5/18 or Wed 5/19 (we think it will be Wednesday as that night is more desirable for the networks to have Stephen Curry on TV than Tuesday, but we’ll see if there are other factors involved).      The loser of Sunday’s big Grizzlies-Warriors matchup would have to face the 10th seed, win that, then play the loser of the 7th- vs 8th-place game for the official No. 8 seed in the playoffs.      Tomorrow’s game for each team (MEM-SAC and NOP-GSW) is thereby actually meaningless because all combinations will result in the Sunday MEM-GSW matchup still deciding who finishes in 8th place, with the notation that the head-to-head series between them is currently knotted up at 1-1:      If GSW beats NOP and MEM beats SAC: both teams are 38-33 heading into MEM-GSW. Obviously the winner on Sunday would finish 39-33, good for 8th place and better than the loser’s 38-34 final record.      If GSW loses to NOP and MEM beats SAC, GSW is 37-34 and MEM is 38-33 heading into the final game. GSW winning that final game means both finish tied at 38-34, but GSW would obviously win the head-to-head tiebreaker at 2-1.      If GSW beats NOP and MEM loses to SAC, GSW is 38-33 and MEM is 37-34, and GSW would have to beat MEM to avoid a tie at 38-34, in which MEM would win the head-to-head tiebreaker, 2-1.      And it follows that if GSW loses to NOP and MEM loses to SAC, both teams would be 37-34 and the winner of Sunday would obviously finish with the better W-L record at 38-38 and in 8th place.      Because tomorrow’s game is therefore “meaningless”, there is speculation that Steve Kerr will rest Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Andrew Wiggins, as they are all “banged up” (and Eric Paschall and Jordan Bell will be available)""      Courtesy of the Lets Go Warriors Youtube Channel"
anyone else love that jordan bell spine tingler
Anyone else ever wonder why Jordan Bell runs and jogs like he's a choo-choo train?
"And Jordan ""running in slippers"" Bell"
"First and foremost Klay Thompson. Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, Kevin Durant, Shaun Livingston, Nick Young, Kevon Looney, Quinn Cook, Jordan Bell, Zaza Pachulia, Patrick McCaw"
Jordan bell and Gary Payton II coming to play tonight
"Brooks interestingly enough had a fairly mediocre tourney but was huge for the Ducks all season, won Pac12 PotY over Lonzo.  Funny that Jordan Bell flamed out and Brooks, Boucher, and Pritchard all seemed to have worked out solid roles in the league. I though Brooks was slept on going into that draft."
"Yes ofc I didn’t mention Steph bc it’s a given but you are right it’s effectiveness is absolutely bc of Steph but honestly I just entirely disagree with you. Green is a capable and effective roll man because of his ability to make high level decisions. The fact that you mention wiseman negates his ability really just goes to show your lack of knowledge/understanding of the effectiveness of this play. Green has been throwing lobs to the dunkers since they began running the play. Bogut, iguadola, wiseman, shit even Jordan bell have been the beneficiary of curry/dray pnr in the form of easy dunks  lmao also I just realized you referred to curry as the greatest pnr ball handler ever. Im a curry fan boy and he is absolutely 100% not the greatest pnr ball handler ever. He’s not even the best right now lol. Cmon bro"
"Shot profile of Jordan Clarkson, hands like Jordan Bell."
Remember when we all thought that was going to be Jordan Bell?
"After Curry,  Klay Thompson - First team all rookie  Harrison Barnes - First team all rookie  Patrick McCaw - a decent role player despite being a 2nd round pick. Nothing out of this world but played well and beyond expectations.  Jordan Bell - another 2nd rounder who played well above expectations, much like Pat  Eric Paschall - First team all rookie"
"Steve Kerr means that with those guys, if Curry was doubled all game he could count on them making the right play.  But the fact is, is that really that much to ask? I think if you build an average and competent team around Curry you will still win. It doesn't even have to be the smartest team ever.  He was making fucking Patrick Mccaw and Jordan Bell look fucking decent in the playoffs lol.  Wiseman, Wiggins and Oubre are just a weird combo."
Uhhh i don’t think Jordan Bell is on the Lakers
Lol Jordan Bell. Go home Perk
Jordan Bell is a bum lmao
Jordan Bell? Lol
He plays nothing like Jordan Bell Perk shut up
"I’m just saying Simmons is a better offensive player than at least one starter w Draymond since their championship runs. He’s a better offensive player than Bogut, Javale, Zaza, Looney, or Jordan Bell… who ALL started next to Dray in the championship years  I’m saying it can work because I’ve SEEN it work"
His career outlasted Jordan Bell.
This is the same dude that released Marquese Chriss and Jordan Bell for doing dumb shit then re-signed them both. Not to mention giving headcase Kelly Oubre 15M to throw a temper tantrum
"Ours is more recent though Dillon Brooks is looking nice in Memphis. We got Payton Pritchard, Bol Bol, Chris Boucher and Jordan Bell...so pretty meh generally. Aaron Brooks I guess had a few years he looked nice in Houston but that's getting into old head territory/outside the 10 year window...."
So they can sign ~~Omer Asik~~Jordan Bell and Chasson Randle~~Solomon Hill~~ to bloated contracts.
And the Warriors bought Jordan Bell from the Bulls!
Jordan Bell really needs help
"This is the wackest argument ever lmao. The Raptors barely beat a Dubs team with 2/3 of its best players injured (not to mention the $50+ Million of cap space they accounted for. You think Steph would have been box-and-oned if we had other good rotation players?) Jordan Bell, Alphonso Mickinnie, Jonas Jerebko, Quinn cook should NEVER get finals minutes"
"I love seeing Nba players sauced up at parades. Jordan Bell, Marc Gasol, the legendary JR Smith, and now PJ Tucker!"
Jordan Bell in shambles
"&gt;but you remember Jordan Bell?  No, he remembers *Harden pulling* Jordan Bell to draw a foul.  Sue me, but some of us pay a lot of attention to bullshit flops and acting behavior meant to trick the refs. Most of the time it's the same select 20 or so individuals. That shit is triggering and stays long term in my mind."
"You don’t remember refs waving off a Harden made three on a bullshit call in the middle of their iconic 0-27, but you remember Jordan Bell? Feel like you might not really be casting a critical eye on that game."
CP3 didn't play that game. The thing I remember most about that game is Harden pulling Jordan Bell towards him when he's screening to fake a moving screen.
Jordan/Kobe wish they had a blowjob bell like Giannis
"I just chuckled a little. Let me put down my classwork for my Advanced Applications in Statistics class at MIT Open Courseware for a second to teach you a little something about how mathematical models work. You probably couldn't even begin to comprehend how the models I work on in my spare time work, but I'll try anyway. It's good to pass on the knowledge, especially to those who are not well endowed in the analytical side of things.  You must be one of those Lakers fans that thinks championships are actually important, completely ignorant to the fact that any legendary player (Duncan anyone?) would take a 55 FG% than some useless jewelry ring anyday.  You don't know anything about the PER valuations and the metrics used to accentuate intricate sample sets about autonomous principles that can be extracted to show that Kobe Bryant has never actually hit a game winner in his career. All his game winners are media hype tapes to sell shoes. Kobe is very fortunate that he's marketed so well by Nike and the Lakers franchise.  ESPN and the whole 'next Jordan' narrative has you thinking Kobe is clutch but he's not, every data point that was graphed on the Cartesian plane while prime factorization was allowed to exist in a null factor showed that Kobe continued to fail theses primitive tests. I studied statistical variations in geometric localities and each and every one of their correspondent asymptotic differentiations provided me with the conclusion that your so called Kobe is the worst clutch shooter in the NBA.  Cosine functions developed at Princeton while combined with the Bell curve allows us to measure basketball production without affecting Higgs Boson-like particles that would otherwise exist in non-zero environments. And where do you think Kobe ranks on that scale? The bottom of the Bell Curve. They ran about ten thousand trials of the same repeating polymorphic routes emulating artificially generated synergy optimization and the Mamba was nowhere to be found in either planes.  ""Eye tests"" are a layman's tool for avoiding thinking and this kind of narrow tunnel vision only exacerbates current falsifications that we can rely on such a poor method of extrapolation. I don't watch basketball but the fact of the matter is that I don't need to. It's all in the stats. The numbers don't lie.  Your ""Kobe"" is just an average NBA player who gets an ungodly amount of touches thanks to his marketing. Kobe was never the best player in the league, nor even a top 250 player in the league at any point in his career. I wish people understood more the numbers side of basketball and woke up and finally realized that this guy not only is overrated, but flat out isn't good at basketball in any way whatsoever."
