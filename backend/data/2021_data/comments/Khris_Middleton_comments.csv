"East front court is stacked but I definitely think he makes it. Here is a table of the players that I think are genuine contenders for an All-Star spot in the East front court, with the players I deem to current be a lock bolded.

No it‚Äôs not.  Khris Middleton is better percentage wise than Kobe Bryant at the midrange why is he not recognized for it more?
"I‚Äôm taking about shooting. Hence why I said ‚Äúin general‚Äù lol.  It‚Äôs weird that anyone refers to deep 3‚Äôs as ‚ÄúLillard Range‚Äù when playing against Stephen Curry himself, the greatest shooter of all time.  Statistically Khris Middleton is a better midrange shooter than Kobe and Jordan but no one thinks of him over those 2 when thinking of the best midrange scorers.  Obviously it‚Äôs not the same gap between Dame and Curry but for me the concepts the same.  Curry is more known for it and when thinking ‚Äúdeep 3‚Äôs‚Äù i‚Äôll always think him over Dame and i‚Äôm willing to bet the majority thinks that too"

"that draft was BAD, there's legit no way Draymond makes it to 7.  He's at worst the 5th pick in retrospect and probably goes 4th.  AD, Lillard, Beal, Draymond &amp; Khris Middleton are the top 5 players.  After that it's Harrison Barnes, Jae Crowder, Drummond, Fournier, Terrence Ross &amp; Austin Rivers.  Oddly enough it seems likely that the Warriors would end up with Harrison Barnes all over again."
"this is probably right.  I wouldn't be shocked if Khris Middleton got taken ahead of Draymond but he's likely 4th overall, and definitely no worse than 5th."
"He'd go 4th  AD, Dame, Beal, Draymond. Khris Middleton 5th."
You forgot Khris Khash Money Middleton
This man has Steph Curry one spot ahead of Khris Middleton lmao
"Lots of #2 guys are on max contracts. Klay Thompson, Khris Middleton, CJ McCollum..."

Their #1 option is basically Khris Middleton
"Yea, my point was it‚Äôs close with a difference in shot selection.  It‚Äôs like Giannis averaging 55% FG vs Khris Middleton shooting 55% FG. You tell me which is more impressive.  On a similar note, the fact that Lebron has worse splits even if by a tiny margin while taking more efficient shots only talks to how efficient KD is in ***every*** facet of the game, something Lebron isn‚Äôt.  Then there‚Äôs the eye-test, not a shot KD can‚Äôt hit. Volume numbers favor Lebron, but efficiency and the Eye Test favor KD."
I like to think that Rashard Lewis would essentially be Khris Middleton if he was playing today
Khris Middleton
Pels and Grizzlies need another piece or 2. They might get them in the draft this year they might not.  Mavs will be good but they also probably need another star specifically a wing defender and scorer like a Paul George or Khris Middleton.

Not even a mention of Khris Middleton. Feels bad man
"Might be the most upset I've ever seen Khris Middleton, lol."

"I feel dumb - is there a reason why certain players don't show up on the position-specific lists? Haven't checked any other players but I noticed that Donte DiVincenzo and Khris Middleton are in the top 30 overall, but not listed on any of the lists by position.  Edit: Lowry, Lillard, Conley, etc. missing from the PG list."

All-Team Automatic Midrange  1. LA 2. CP3 3. David West 4. Shaun Livingston 5. Khris Middleton playing the Celts  Who am I forgetting?
"2 back to back MVP and 0 Finals appearance to show for..   He failed the first year against the Raptors led Kawhi because he was doing the same shit  He gone and fucking do it again the next year against Heat led Jimmy Butler  That in itself should be enough talking point for ESPN and fan to see how big of a gaping hole Giannis has, yet nobody ever talk about it.. instead everyone just keeps chanting trade Khris Middleton for a better guy"
"Middleton and Holiday are two guys who can score 20 any night, but neither is a legitimate #2 on a championship team. They don't create plays for anyone else. They'll give you 20 but can't get anyone else open looks.   Holiday is a combo guard, Middleton is a nice scoring wing. Neither of them makes the game easier for anyone on the court offensively. They're pretty good at getting their own shots and playing defense but I don't think they help anyone offensively.  These guys are basically CJ Mocullom clones. Can CJ put the ball in the hoop and give you 20 every night? Of course. In an idea situation is he your number 2? Hell no.   People understand that CJ is not a legitimate #2 on a championship team but because Khris and Jrue also play defense,they are magically considered to be legitimate #2s."
What big man is making it to the finals without a guard that can get his own shot and score?  Tell me one. Giannis is amazing. And he's playing with Khris Middleton.. Jeez.
"Seems like people forget Giannis is basically a PF/C, Bc he dribbles the ball a decent amount. I can‚Äôt think of any big that took over in the playoffs recently (Dirk? But even then damn near the entire Mavs were shooting lights out).   Giannis needs a star scoring guard (Dame, Kyrie, hell maybe Kemba), that can run the pick &amp; roll with him, feed him inside, or get a bucket themselves in crunch time in the playoffs. Thats what they got Jrue for but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be enough.   I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs silly to use the regular season to assess his value. He just hasn‚Äôt had the right team in the playoffs. Idk what your ceiling is in the playoffs when Khris Middleton is your second best player  And that‚Äôs not even getting to his impact on the defensive end."
this is the new ‚Äúkhris middleton is underrated‚Äù
"\&gt;  its clear offensively the show runs through Middleton   lol  \&gt;  with 2 minutes left, i have more confidence in Khris   And of course this nothing to do with who's running the offense."
"he's one of the most flawed MVPs, and its clear offensively the show runs through Middleton, who i think is underrated actually. with 2 minutes left, i have more confidence in Khris.   i think Embiid would abuse Giannis this year. Embiid playing downhill this year"
"Even when not at full force, you still have lineups that probably could end up a top 2 seed in either conference. The much maligned world cup team from last time could have a starting lineup of Kemba Walker, Donovan Mitchell, Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton, and Myles Turner with a pretty solid bench. They may not have the upper-end star power to match the elite teams, but that's a damn good lineup if given time to fully gel."

"That's not on Dame, that's on Portland deciding that the perfect second piece to build around Dame is...a shittier version of Dame with all the same flaws but not the same offensive ceiling.  I'm not trying to shit on CJ, but he's about the absolute worst fit for Dame possible as a second banana.   They should have packaged him for someone like Klay or Khris Middleton (just examples, not these guys specifically) years ago."
"""Now they're saying it's a 2, he had a foot on the line...""  Also he 100% mixed up Middleton for Giannis tonight. You know, because they're so incredibly similar looking. Khris looks more like Giannis than Thanasis for sure."
Khris Middleton is the definition of fools gold. He only show up on national tv reg season games
This sub thinks Khris Middleton is more than enough help ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"On/off is how the team does when you are on the court compared to off (ie on the bench). For example if you have a net rating of +3.0 this is really good, but if your team has a net rating of +5.0 when you aren't on the court than this means your team statistically did better with you off the court. It is good for gauging players on bad teams. For example, Khris Middleton was on some bad teams early in his career in Detroit and those early Bucks teams before Giannis broke out. He always made his team better and had really good on/off which shows that even those he was on a bad team, he made that bad team a fair bit better.  It isn't just good for net rating, it is also good for rebounds. There are players like Luka Doncic or pretty much every other high rebounding guard in the NBA that gobble up a bunch of uncontested rebound but barely influence their teams rebounding. If you compare that to Steven Adams who averages less rebounds but makes his team significantly better at rebounds you can see that Steven Adams is a great player to have on the court in terms of rebounding.  On/off biggest advantage is that it takes into account how your team plays compared to with you and without you as in the end, team performance is all that matter. This is also its biggest disadvantage though so it can be influenced by small sample sizes and noise or if you have a really good player on your bench (for example Jaren Jackson Jr's on/off is pretty bad since they got Brandon Clarke)."
Khris Middleton looks like the Giraffe from Madagascar
Khris Middleton has no vision at all. Great plays from the Lakers rn.
Yo Khris Middleton looks like Pennywise the clown
&gt;Khris Middleton - 22.1 PPG on 64.5% TS   What a year this man is having so far.
ESPN: Khris Middleton doesn't care about the bucks season
"Pistons acquiring Brandon Jennings for Brandon Knight, Slava Kravtsov and a throw in named Khris Middleton"
"Bruh KD post Achilles tear is still blowing by defenders like Khris Middleton off the dribble and slamming it. KD is 100% more mobile than dirk ever was, dirk was never as fluid, quick and agile than KD is now. No one ever has moved like KD at his height, not even Giannis is that agile."
probably like a khris middleton and marcus smart
Dude 45-20 FTA differential. No Tatum. Kemba on minutes restriction. Yes we can definitely still beat them with our full team. They had both their star players. With Tatum we would have beaten them I guess.   Bucks can defend Joel. He will have his hands full against Lopez and will be out at the 3 point line a lot. So defence inside will be weak. Khris Middleton will score on whoever guards him. Giannis guarded by Simmons mostly. He will definitely do a good job but imo Celtics and Bucks can beat the Sixers unless Ben needs to be guarded at the 3 point line.
"&gt;	 He's a better passer than Khris is, and teams still have to respect him as a driving threat as well as a shooter.   Absolutely not. Middleton is so underrated in this sub."
"Don't know how you watched the Lakers double Harden and take him out of his ""role"" and can't see that value of being multifaceted. Westbrook's ""role"" is to drive to the rim, the Lakers said we are gonna wait here and make you shoot.    If a player can only do one role they are more limited than one that can do many. This is partially what makes LeBron so great. He identified that AD is a great scorer and defender but can't run an offense. So LeBron became the PG.   AD has holes in his game just like Giannis. The disadvantage Giannis has is he is playing with medium star Khris Middleton instead of an MVP type in Kevin Durant. Nobody would give him shit if he let Durant take all the shots in the clutch because they would rightfully see Giannis as great at all other aspects of the game.  How far do the Lakers go with an AD led team with Khris instead of Bron?  That's what I hate about the Ben Taylor takes. The man seem to have no understanding of team construction and salaries. AD making 10mil less than fucking WB, how exactly are the Rockets gonna win that matchup unless they go GSW and insanely outspend."
"A simple high PnR for example. If this is the case, then Khris Middleton will have to be a scorer more than Giannis.   I was about to say(but reluctant to) that Bucks needs to produce a star, with near status to Giannis. And that Khris Middleton is the nearest to that.    I say Middleton needs to take 20 shots. Especially in the playoffs. But last year, his efficiency decreased when he up his shots to 20 FGA in the playoffs. [Also that almost 2/3 of his threes were assisted.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/middlkh01.html#2019-2020-sum:playoffs_shooting).   Nevertheless, my take is for Khris Middleton need to step it up and become a second star. Someone who can consistently create on his own and generate points."
Anthony Davis at three and that Khris Middleton placement are just gross.
"Middleton brings more offensively IMO, but differently. Jrue's a much better passer and more athletic, you can see it when he drives to the hoop where Khris has to be a lot more deliberate and use his length to get round guys where Jrue can blow by guys with speed a lot more.   Khris is more athletic than people credit him for but his game is way more based around his stupid shot making ability than Jrue who can do everything well, but isn't the shooter Khris is"
"A&amp;M had Khris Middleton, Deandre Jordan, and Robert Johnson, but Acie stood out. He was so clutch in college, he made a ton of big shots in his career, especially his senior year."
Khris Middleton against the celtics is up there with untucked jersey Kyrie and Hoodie Melo.
khris middleton
Mistook Giannis for Khris Middleton at the FT line last night.
Look at Curry carrying a team with only one other top 100 player (Wiggins at 98) to the playoffs. What a legend. Glad he can finally be given his respect and be put on a tier with Khris Middleton.
imagine ranking Khris Middleton ahead of Joel Embiid
Khris middleton at 11? Gtfo. He's nowhere near that
Agreed. Here's who I'd have on the East team right now (no particular order):  * Zach LaVine * Nikola Vucevic * Khris Middleton * Kevin Durant * Joel Embiid * Malcolm Brogdon * Jaylen Brown * Bam Adebayo * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Julius Randle * Jrue Holiday * Bradley Beal
"Man, Khris Middleton is so good. He is clearly top 20 this season. If he had the physical tools he would easily be a superstar."
Khris Middleton and Lebron
"Ehh, being absolutely fair I'm not speaking on this specific game since I missed the 4th due to the Heat game -- but HOW he got those 11 points absolutely matters. I saw one that was a putback -- which is great, high % -- but creates no pressure on the defense. That's stuff that gets cleaned up come playoff time. If he can't create looks for himself and others in the halfcourt, the Bucks are going to continue to struggle come playoff time.   Also, the fact that the team needs to get him the ball in spots that are easy to score in (read: create for him. And no, entry passes to the low block to people like Jokic and Shaq are not the same) then it becomes a lot easier to stop him. End of the day, the ball is in Khris Middleton's hands down the stretch. Teams will live with him killing them 1 on 1 if it means Giannis is turned into a screen setter, lob catcher, and a clean-up guy (which he's great at, but teams will absolutely live with). Middleton is all too often tasked with closing games with Giannis reverting to a secondary option. His game is limited in the half court, so it makes sense, but that limitation is going to cost them playoff games. Your go to guy down the stretch of games needs to be better than Khris Middleton."
I‚Äôm using my expertise from watching the last 4 years of Bucks playoff games and watching Khris Middleton be a perfectly very good player who isn‚Äôt good enough to make up for giannis ability to hit jumpers consistently and their coaching being extremely predictable. But yeah great he‚Äôs off to a hot start this season. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs more representative. Players have never done that before and reverted back to their mean.
you shut your mouth khris middleton cutest dude in the nba
Khris Middleton. Maybe the most talented forgettable dude
"Adding to that, Khris Middleton on the Pistons"
was seen to be getting his teammate Khris Middleton open 3 straight plays   I‚Äôm assuming you watched the highlights and not the game
Why? Khris Middleton is the better shooter and scorer.
"This, I saw dudes laughing about how khris Middleton was taking the last shot like he wasn‚Äôt on fire"
Khris Middleton ain't no KD
Middleton with that shitty ass shoot first mentality missed a wide open giannis. Khris there‚Äôs a reason ur not the first star bud
Khris Middleton being the guy in clutch is so jarring to me lol
"Khris Middleton is very efficient, he needs more touches."
Khris Middleton is unstoppable
Nets aren‚Äôt even getting beat by Giannis they‚Äôre getting beat by khris Middleton lmao
Superstar khris middleton
Khris ‚ÄúMichael Jordan‚Äù Middleton
Khris Middleton has only played 28 minutes.  Probably coming in after the timeout.
Khris Middleton is one ugly motherfucker
Khris Middleton gets payed 30M+ per year but can‚Äôt fix his teeth?
Khris Middleton is about to go off if this is how Giannis is gunna play
"Strong disagree there. Shaq absolutely was the better player, but Kobe was an allstar since 2000 and averaging 30 points with shaq in 2002...Kobe was averaging as much as khris middleton at the very least in 1998...Shaq needed co superstars his entire career. Whether it be penny averaging 35 pts in the playoffs, Kobe, wade, nash, bron, or KG and pierce. Shaq knew with his play style he needed another superstar next to him. Thats why we teamed up with them his entire career. Im arguing giannis needs the same. I will agree however giannis cannot get a bucket in clutch situation, a big flaw to his game. Im not saying giannis is at all better than shaq. More so arguing the numbers he puts up is just as dominant."
"Try reading more than 2 sentences into an article.  &gt; The Milwaukee Bucks lurk on the fringes of the Irving bidding with an offer centered around Malcolm Brogdon, the reigning NBA Rookie of the Year, and Khris Middleton, sources say. The Bucks have not yet put a first-round pick on the table, sources say, but the bet here is that they would to get the deal done"
"Lmao y‚Äôall want anyone and everyone to be KD. Literally no one is shooting like that aside form KD, Khris Middleton, and Steph"
"How does one ring put him up there above Bird and Duncan? Yall are seriously overrating him in the grand scheme... He only has two MVPs because the NBA is obsessed with promoting its European stars and Giannis has had the absolute red carpet laid out for him. I understand the Bucks were regular season juggernauts, but Giannis' offensive game is one dimensional and he's easy to shut down in the playoffs.   I'd say he'd need three rings to even touch the all time top 10. And good luck getting even one when your best player doesn't have a jumper.   Giannis is more suited to be a 1B on a championship team, deferring to a knockdown shooter that is better than Khris Middleton. He won't ever win a chip as the best player on his team without seriously upgrading his midrange game.  But damn, is he likeable. I hope he becomes some mutant with range, stays healthy, and we see the freak evolve. If he can actually start hitting 3's (2/2 in the asg!), it's game over for everyone for the next ten years."
Tony Snell   Khris Middleton  Bismack Biyombo   Kelly Olynyk
Khris Middleton
"Pretty much anyone who watched Luka play without dumb biases (the amount of Jan Vesely references people used pre-draft was insane) had him as the #1 prospect, he was the definition of a generational can't miss prospect whose floor was a better passing Khris Middleton, which is incredible"
"I think you're mostly right, but I don't think we're receiving those kinds of offers yet. He's like Khris Middleton with more defensive versatility but worse playmaking. Which is a damn fine #2 to have.   But selling high for a player like Middleton is still a ton. It doesn't seem like we're getting Godfather offers yet."

"Nah we made 3-4 in garbage time. We missed like 20 wide open 3s in the 1st half alone. I mean the defender wasn't even in the picture. Donte, Lopez and Pat C also missed like 5-6 layups and dunks. Khris Middleton missed 3 FTs. It was a bad night even for our low shooting standards."
Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday can‚Äôt play this poor come playoffs.
Why does Khris Middleton take so few shots??
"Here's an *amazing* hypothetical trade - Khris Middleton for Kyle Lowry straight up.  As a Raptors fan, I would love this trade. We would get to see the start of our 'rebuild' by trading our aging top-10 point guard for a great piece to build for the future in Khris Middlleton. Khris Middleton can be kept if the Raptors want to stay middle of the pack in the East. Steady Freddie would take the rain as the de facto playmaker of the raptors - a role he's ready for. The team would lose a bit of playmaking, ballhandling and leadership from Kyle Lowry, but Khris Middleton would give us better shooting and Middleton isn't a bad playmaker himself. Raptors could trade Middleton too for 2 or 3 first round picks if they wanna rebuild harder.  Milwaukee fans: wouldn't you like this trade? You would get first an amazing presence for the team's culture. Kyle has shown he can work great with coaches to develop an amazing culture; with Kyle and Mike's brains working together, the Bucks could come up with some super high-IQ offensive schemes. Next you would get improved playmaking and ballhandling from Lowry. Him and Holiday would be an unreal guard duo. Lowry knows how to use his body extremely well so there would be little loss on defence despite his deceptive 6 ' 0 frame. And last but not least, Lowry will give you an efficient 18 a night - only a 2 point loss from Middleton.  Their salaries match pretty evenly - maybe Milwuakee would have to throw in salary filler - but other than that the trade would work pretty evenly. As a Raptors fan I am sad to see Lowry go - he was an amazing leader not only for the Raptors but in everything he does. Lowry will always be an icon in Canada. This represents a win-now move for the Milwuakee Bucks. With the offensive versatility, culture, and defence that this team will have led by the Big 3 of Giannis, Kyle Lowry, and Jrue Holiday, this team will be enough to beat any other team in the East. I would bet that Big 3 and the Bucks depth to win over Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden and their depth. I would easily see this team beating the 76ers.   Let me know what you all think!"
"A nightmare? Idk they've only played a 6 game series where Atlanta had more talent, home court, and the better team, and then the Bucks series where the Celtics just imploded and Kyrie played like a dumbass and ignored the gameplan. These don't seem like a good enough sample to call it a nightmare when there's clearly a lot of other things going on there.   Like, Giannis is a nightmare for us, Khris Middleton hates us, and they're long enough to make Tatum struggle, and the Bucks would beat us, but I don't look at that and think that Bud is the main driver behind that."
"Plus there are TONS of other players who are good enough to be all stars like: Jason Tatum, Zion Williamson, ja morant, jaylen brown, devin booker, donavan Mitchell, Paul George, SGA, deaaron fox, jimmy butler, Kyle Lowry, khris middleton, Jamal Murray, KAT, bam adebayo, jrue holiday, Julius randle, domantas sabonis, Brandon Ingram, cj McCollum, klay thompson, demar derozan, Bradley Beal, Ben Simmons, Rudy gobert, Jerami Grant, Christian wood, Fred vanleet, kristaps porzingis, Zach Lavine,  nikola vucevic, d‚Äôanglo Russell, Andre Drummond, Gordon Hayward, Pascal Siakam, Collin sexton, mike Conley, this is not including the guys you said. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs ever been this many players with a legit chance of making the all star game ever."
Too bias towards lebron is unreal. They were comparing the help giannis got in khris Middleton to Anthony fucking Davis Hahaha.
Khris Middleton has been far better than Tatum this season yet he didn‚Äôt make the all star team and Tatum is starting
&gt; Giannis also did all of that without having a player of the caliber of Anthony Davis to take away attention from him and playing the lowest amount of minutes of an MVP ever.   &amp;#x200B;  1. Khris Middleton had a historically efficient season. 2. Is him playing the lowest amount of minutes a reflection of him or his supporting cast?

Oh my bad lol I thought you said Middleton would be the 4th best player on any other contender. But still that's again only true of the Lakers and Nets. You could argue PG/Khris or Simmons/Khris.
Not you again man... how does Khris Middleton live rent free in your head? lmao
Jason Kidd telling his players multiple times to intentionally miss a free throw when up 3 with almost no time left.  [* (on why he asked Khris Middleton to intentionally miss a FT with the Bucks up by 3 with 2 seconds left and the Cavs had no timeouts)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/7l0t02/reasons_why_jason_kidd_should_be_fired/)  &gt;We'll take the bet of someone missing it from the other side of the floor. being a gambler... understanding if we did make the free throw..our luck...they get it inbounds to half court and we foul the 3 point shooter and it's a 4 point play. So we'll take our chances with them heaving a full court shot.  [Video of a different occurrence where he told giannis to intentionally miss a free throw up 3 with 0.2 seconds left.](https://twitter.com/fmaddenNBA/status/845467532668665856)
Jason Kidd told Khris Middleton to miss a free throw up 3 in a close game with &lt;10 seconds left because he feared the 4 point play
Khris Middleton saw we were playing a sub-.500 team and assumed we must be playing the Celtics.
Maybe Khris Middleton is the real number one on this team.
who is this Khris Middleton the announcers keep referring to?  Don't they mean bucks legend Pat Middleton?
because khris middleton is physically incapable of throwing an accurate lob pass to him
No way. Gallo isn‚Äôt the passer Kukoc was. Shooting is like the only thing in common here.  I don‚Äôt know why but I get Khris Middleton vibes for Kukoc.
Khris Middleton. He's already forgotten about quite a bit in 2021. Damn shame because he's an awesome player  Tobias Harris is another good one
Khris Middleton type of beat
"In no particular order.   1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. James Harden   5. Giannis   6. Nikola Jokic   7. Luka Doncic   8. Stephen Curry   9. Damian Lillard   10. Joel Embiid   11. Paul George   12. Kyrie Irving   13. Jimmy Butler   14. Jayson Tatum   15. Trae Young  16. Anthony Davis   17. KAT   18. Rudy Gobert   19. Zach Lavine   20. Bradley Beal   21. CJ Mccollum   22. Chris Paul   23. Donovan Mitchell   24. Domantas Sabonis   Those are 24 guys that are better. I think Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton and some others are better too but that‚Äôs an opinion."
"He doesn‚Äôt have better stats or efficiency than Sabonis, Tobias Harris, Hayward, Trae young, or Khris Middleton. You can‚Äôt just take out the parts of the season that help. If that was the case I‚Äôd say simmons is averaging 22/8/8 since febuary"
Celtics. Really hope the Bucks and their dad Khris Middleton dad dick them in the playoffs again. 2 all stars my arse
Khris Middleton should replace Jayson Tatum
Brook Lopez was a sub par defender with the Nets. I believe KAT will do fairly similar or maybe better with Giannis as his pair. Easily will be one of the best  if not the best and well balance trio along with Khris Middleton.
"I think trying to use things like player tracking in an advanced stat is really cool. That being said, I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm putting a lot of merit into an advanced stat that ranks Bazemore ahead of people like, kyrie, devin booker, khris Middleton, Ben Simmons etc."
How you gonna let Khris Middleton of all players live rent free in your head
"I like Fred‚Äôs game a lot, but it‚Äôs hard for me to see why he should get in over Trae young or Khris Middleton, hell even guys like Gordon Hayward or Malcolm Brogdon who are both putting together really good starts to the season and I don‚Äôt think got even a passing mention as potential all stars."
"Thanks, now I can update my list of All-Star snubs!  DeMar DeRozan  Jordan Clarkson  Mike Conley  Christian Wood  De'Aaron Fox  Clint Capela  Domatas Sabonis  Trae Young  Fred Van Vleet   Devin Booker  Tobias Harris  Khris Middleton  Jamal Murray  Jerami Grant  Bam Adebayo  Jimmy Butler  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Gordon Hayward  *Russell Westbrook*"
Khris Middleton is not an all star
Yes.  Nut honestly at this point I'd prefer if Middleton got the rest than playing in the game.  And I expect him to see a jump once Jrue comes back.  Without him teams have been able to target Khris a lot more.
Jalen ‚ÄòKhris Middleton‚Äô  Brunson.
"For Khris Middleton, Donte and two first rounders.  You sure?"
wait wait wait... khris middleton didn‚Äôt make it?!?!
Khris Middleton robbed
East:  Trae Young  Jimmy Butler  Khris Middleton  Domantas Sabonis  Bam Adebayo  West:  De'Aaron Fox  Devin Booker  DeMar DeRozan  Brandon Ingram   Christian Wood
"Grant shouldn't make it either, we fuckin suck.    But Middleton has been really inconsistent, including being pretty bad every game during the Bucks' 5-game losing streak.  I think you could even argue that Jrue is the 2nd most important player on the Bucks because of how much they've underperformed without him.  Statistically Khris's shooting splits are great as ever, but defensively he's still mediocre, and in the advanced stats Jrue is about even with him with lower usage rates/game.    And eye-test-wise, at least to me, Khris is just a half-step behind where he was last year, while the talent level of the top players in the east increased pretty significantly."
Khris Middleton. 21/6/6 on 50/43/90 splits and not even getting mentioned as a snub
KHRIS MIDDLETON BIGGEST SNUB OF ALL TIME
"When did I ever say giannis was bad? Giannis has had a better supporting cast, shooters. Embiid would do well with a wing like khris middleton who can shoot instead of ben simmons."
how has no one mentioned Khris Middleton
really nobody giving khris middleton any love? i would confidently say hes a lock to make it
Khris Middleton is fun to watch. Big fan of his mid range game
Khris Middleton is not a true all-star
"It's easy, wait for a Kawhi-level wing to be available and flip CJ for a rental and hope for a Raptors-level miracle.  Even if someone like Khris Middleton is available I doubt that a McCollum/Middleton swap would actually bring them over the top."
"I sat down and did this exercise before starters got announced:   I‚Äôd have:    EAST STARTERS G - James Harden G - Jaylen Brown F - Giannis Antetekounmpo F - Kevin Durant F - Joel Embiid  EAST RESERVES 1 - Kyrie Irving 2 - Jason Tatum 3 - Bam Adebayo 4 - Nikola Vucevic 5 - Ben Simmons 6 - Bradley Beal 7 - Domantas Sabonis ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî 1st OUT - Jimmy Butler 2nd OUT - Zach LaVine 3rd OUT - Trae Young 4th OUT - Julius Randle 5th OUT -  Khris Middleton 6th OUT - Fred Vanvleet 7th OUT - Jerami Grant 8th OUT - Gordon Hayward 9th OUT - Jrue Holiday 10th OUT - Tobias Harris 11th OUT - Malcom Brogdan  I could see reasonable arguments for all the guys listed there and the high scoring bad team guys are admittedly the toughest to deal with.  Hell, there are probably a few omissions there too -  but IMO all these guys are having the kind of seasons where a ton of players will get shafted.   Each has a great cases depending on your own personal criteria."

"Portland fans,  Lets say you could magically trade CJ for Khris Middleton. Is that an improvement?"
you really think the Celtics beat the Bucks 4-1?  Bucks haven't been playing great but neither have the Celtics. And Khris Middleton goes sicko mode against the Celtics

It‚Äôs not that bad a debate but all Philly fans pushing Tobias as a 3rd all star over Middleton as mils 2nd guy have been a bit annoying.  Scoring numbers are identical but playmaking isn‚Äôt close and defense is a wash for me.  Yes Philly has been much more injured but their point differential lags far behind mils and phi might be only 2 games up soon.  Yes Philly deserves credit for being the 1 seed but that‚Äôs part of why I won‚Äôt think much about putting Simmons over khris
"I didn‚Äôt say he‚Äôs not.  But he wasn‚Äôt some major fuck up losing him. The Lakers aren‚Äôt hurting or shouldn‚Äôt be down for losing like say the pistons are for losing Khris Middleton.  Everyone acted like the Lakers gave away a future star, not an average big man in the league"
"Every Celtics fan has nightmares about Khris ""Michael Jordan"" Middleton..... easy choice."
"* Apologies for not knowing John Collins' exact stat line off the top of my head, but I think what I said about him being an efficient, positive player who isn't having plays ran for him holds true. * Fair enough, but I did say injuries were an issue.  * Yeah that's not great, gotta concede on that one.  * I think Gallo's slump has a lot to do *with* Trae. He was fantastic on last year's Thunder with CP3. Why? Because CP3 is a natural playmaker who could put Gallo in good positions. This year, 50.4% of Gallo's shots come from catch and shoots. Last year, on the Thunder, it was only 45%. The year before, on the Clippers, 35%. They're using him like Ben McLemore when he's closer to Khris Middleton. Why? Because Trae has the ball so, so much. I know his sample size is small, but the same thing applies to Bogdan: on the Kings, 41% of his field goals came from catch and shoots, in nine games for the Hawks, it's 64%.  * The Bulls starting lineup is second-year Coby White, Lavine, rookie Patrick Williams, Lauri, WCJ. Otto Porter and Lauri have been injured for stretches, and they have no natural playmakers. They've repeatedly lost close games to contenders. Thad Young is the second best player on their team. Their roster talent is nowhere near comparable to y'alls, yet they're playing better. The Hawks are undeniably disappointing relative to the quality of players they've assembled.   As I said, it's not all Trae. Some of it is injuries, some of it is Pierce. But Trae has been this way since college. The ball is always in his hands, you live and die with Trae. And it makes him easy to scheme against. Look at y'alls first game against us (when most of your team was healthy, bar Gallo) and Trae was held to seven points. Why? Because when one guy has the ball, the issues of switching/rotations, tracking ball movement, positional size matchups, etc because less of an issue. That issue is magnified when the one guy who has the ball is a small 6'0"" tall guard. The Hawks should have feasted on the Hornets; we're a team that can't defend the three, has no inside presence (Capela had 19 rebounds), and a very weak bench. But if you stop Trae, you stop the Hawks, and we did it fairly effectively twice, despite missing Zeller and Devonte being in poor form."
I guess the Bucks are on the same tier because Khris Middleton said the same thing üòé
"Vin Baker, Khris Middleton, Big Z"
Yes playmaking is a big edge for khris.  Mils record is subpar but their offense is still better than phillys clearly and Tobias doesn‚Äôt contribute that much to Phillys great defense.  I definitely put in Simmons over Middleton however and record will help too

"In the one good year chris paul had with us (where he had 18/8 ... meanwhile khris middleton had 18/6.) we won 65 games and chris paul was out for 1/4 of the season, while our 3 next best players missed significant time. I can tell you that we would've killed for ANYONE who shot as good as brogdon that year. Our best shooter was ryan f'ing anderson who missed just as many games as brogdon did.    The point is yes, Giannis got 60 wins. But as far as good teams go that's fairly pedestrian. Harden did something that no one since MJ did."
"? Middleton won't be an all star this year. Trae, Harden, LaVine, and J Brown are all competing for the final 3 spots. Who do you have Khris over?"
The Bucks had a STACKED roster?? In what world were any of their rosters stacked.  His next best player has been Khris Middleton.  Harden at least had CP3.  Now I know you're clowning.
"You were watching Khris Middleton in the Raptors game, weren‚Äôt you?"
"Ok, so now Giannis is stuck on a team that‚Äôs ceiling relies on Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday, 2 guys that are not all-nba caliber players, with zero bench, zero cap space, and zero picks. If they are subpar, that‚Äôs kinda it for the Bucks. They have no freedom moving forward. I shit you not, that massive trade for Jrue would have pushed me away from re-signing because now I know exactly where the team stands moving forward. I think it was a desperate move. They could very well be a 2nd round exit for the next 5 years."
"&gt; Get Giannis his Robin. It's not Jrue Holiday. It's not Khris Middleton.  I mean they don't really have anything to give, so they'd have to lure somebody there via free agency and clear out a bunch of cap space.  It's not just those guys, Giannis is likely going to go into the playoffs with the same glaring flaw in his offense that he's had for two full seasons now.  I don't understand how that's not a huge problem."
Where are the Khris Middleton All Star supporters now?
"I respect Giannis decision to stay in Milwaukee but now that he's committed, they need to step it the fuck up. This is clearly not a contender as currently constructed when you are facing teams with LBJ + AD, Harden + KD + Kyrie, or Kawhi + AD. Get Giannis his Robin. It's not Jrue Holiday. It's not Khris Middleton."
How To Throw The Game In Just 2 Possessions by Khris Middleton
Khris Middleton just ain‚Äôt a #2 option
"We've only been telling you guys for years that no team is going to win s championship with Khris Middleton as a #2 then y'all traded a superstar package for Jrue Holiday and depleted your bench ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  But hey, at least Giannis won't be asking out because there's no pressure on him anymore because no one expects the Bucks to get past the Nets. So there's a silver lining in all of this."
Khris Middleton
I don‚Äôt want to ever play Khris Middleton again. I‚Äôll leave it at that.
"It's obvious Giannis cared more about money and nepotism in getting his brother a contract.  If the man had any pride, he wouldn't be such a poor free throw shooter and he would actually move to a better situation.  When you claim to care about winning but go back to a situation that features your second best player as Khris Middleton, you clearly don't care"
"Khris Middleton is in his own head, no way he should be missing so many open shots."
"It's stupid that coaches just get to completely scrap all this and vote from scratch. The starters are mostly locked before voting, but the reserves are where you have guys fighting for spots and looking for their first ASG, etc.  And that's where you take the smallest pool of voters and let them decide?  Like I get the Khris Middleton love and all, but the guy didn't finish top 10 in any voting group, but will still probably get picked by coaches...what's the point of all this voting then?"
Khris Middleton is a joke like the entire city of Milwaukee
Khris Middleton? More like Khris middling-performance amirite
Tobias Harris &gt; Khris Middleton this season?
Looks like we're getting Khris MIDdleton so far
"""I select Khris Middleton"""
"Giannis just picks his guys. Picked Embiid and Siakam as his first 2 cause they're African like him, and then picked Khris Middleton cause they're teammates. However, those drafts were funny cause LeBron and Giannis had awesome chemistry."
"Ya'll make up shit on here so much. I did not say that.  OP asked if Russ should be a starter in this league. Yes, he should, because he still produces.   I even mentioned his broken shot and ya'll act like I said the guy is an All Star lol. He can still play basketball at a high level, as signified from the fact a high level guy like Khris Middleton is averaging 20/6/6.  Don't make stuff up."
"Nah, he averages 20/10/10, compare that to Middleton whos only on 20/6/6. So by this logic hes way better than Khrisü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"No, I think he has a better case than Sabonis, arguable with vucevic, but Vucevic is producing on a team that has been blasted by injuries and is just generally worse than the Knicks (they might have the worst point guard situation in the NBA).  Aside from that, I would have him behind Kevin Durant, Joel Embiid, Bam Adebayo, Jayson Tatum, Khris Middleton, and Giannis. That would have him at like 7th or 8th in the eastern conference frontcourt, so no, I don't think he deserves to be an all-star."
No Khris Middleton? C'mon man
"Basketball's a 48 minute game, saying that a specific quarter matters more than the others is silly, for one thing, you have to get to the 4th quarter and have the game be close, which is not always the case.   Let me put it like this, Lou Williams is an infinitely better 4th quarter scorer than Rudy Gobert. However, does that mean Lou Williams is a better player than Rudy Gobert? More impactful? No, not even close.   When evaluating players, I want the player who is the best in a 48-minute game.   Khris Middleton is a better scorer in the 4th quarter than Giannis is. Would I rather have Khris Middleton than Giannis? Fuck no. Giannis is the better player over the course of a 48-minute game, even if Middleton is the better late game offensive player."
"Khris Middleton, Tobias Harris, Mike Conley, Kemba Walker, Andrew Wiggins ... list goes on"
"In today's league, 2nd options are AD and Harden. And Khris Middleton is a big drop from there. Back when Bulls got competitive, 2nd and 3rd options were not as great, to say the least.  Don't get me wrong, they had great duos. Just that the 2nd options were not complete monsters like we have now and the overall player quality is much better for 3-8 guys."
**70 points or higher** * Devin Booker - 70pts **60 points or higher** * Carmelo Anthony - 62pts * Steph Curry - 62pts * James Harden - 61pts * Lebron James - 61pts * Damian Lillard - 61pts * Bradley Beal - 60pts * Klay Thompson - 60pts * Kemba Walker - 60pts **50 points or higher** * Russell Westbrook - 58pts * Kyrie Irving - 57pts * LaMarcus Aldridge - 56pts * DeMarcus Cousins - 56pts * Kevin Durant - 54pts * Fred Vanvleet - 54pts * Jimmy Butler - 53pts * Anthony Davis - 53pts * TJ Warren - 53pts * Giannis Antetokounmpo - 52pts * DeMar DeRozan - 52pts * D'Angelo Russell - 52pts * Isaiah Thomas - 52pts * John Wall - 52pts * Caris LeVert - 51pts * Kevin Love - 51pts * Khris Middleton - 51pts * Terrence Ross - 51pts * Eric Gordon - 50pts * Blake Griffin - 50pts * Nikola Jokic - 50pts * CJ McCollum - 50pts * Derrick Rose - 50pts * Lou Williams - 50pts * Trae Young - 50pts
No he‚Äôs saying it‚Äôs easier in hindsight to say the front office did a great job of bringing in talent when those guys weren‚Äôt considered great talent at the time. That‚Äôs like if Khris Middleton became a legit number 2 over the next 2 years. You don‚Äôt know if he will and it takes faith to stay.
Cj McCollum vs Khris Middleton
"You really dont understand what subjective means lmao. you cant be this dense.   &gt;players such as Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Khris Middleton are clearly better and he's on the same level as players like Devin Booker and DeMar DeRozan (who is crazy underrated these days). Making your teammates better is a real thing.  What is this based on oh your opinions lol.....right again you lack comprehension. Even your points are inconsistent and you dont realize how off your logic is lol.    Brown, Irving, Harden, Kris, all play with MVP caliber players on their team, and have played with multiple Allstars on their teams throughout their entire careers.  Since you value winning so much, Young, Beal are both players who have never played on a winning NBA team, and their stats also dont transfer to wins. Beal is an older, less efficient shooter and doesnt translates to wins. Young is younger but is a lot less efficient in shooting, is completely terrible a defensive to the point where the team went through lengths to cover his flaws and doesnt translate to winning.  ( Some more inconsistency in your logic). Devon Booker and Demar are both leading their teams to the playoffs on winning teams....Hahaha.   It's so easy to rebuttal you because you continue to base everything on your own opinions but you're very illogical and inconsistent with your arguments lol. You've been exposed lmao"
"I shouldn't bite but I will.   &gt;Dude learn the definition of Subjective.  Learn that things are absolute.  &gt;LaVine is now averaging a career-high 28.2 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 5.3 assists while shooting 51.8% overall, 42.5% on 3-pointers, and 86.3% on free throws. His true shooting percentage sits at a whopping 65.2%, which is fifth among players with a usage rate over 25 (he‚Äôs right around 30). Truly impressive stuff, a combination of offensive volume and efficiency Eclipsing the best of Derrick Rose and Jimmy Butler Bulls seasons into a historic stratosphere. Four players this season (Kawhi, KD, LaVine, Jokic) are averaging 25-5-5 or better with 50% from the field and 40% from 3 Only four players in NBA history had done that before this season.....he is also only 25 and continuing to develop. really great for young player who hasn't even entered his prime.  Yes you've posted the same numbers three times. They are incredible numbers. No argument here. I'm not debating what his scoring, assist, and rebounds numbers are. I'm not arguing what his shooting splits. I'm not saying they are bad. I'm not saying they at the expense of the Bulls' offense. I'm saying despite Lavine's great numbers, players such as Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Khris Middleton are clearly better and he's on the same level as players like Devin Booker and DeMar DeRozan (who is crazy underrated these days). Making your teammates better is a real thing. Playing defense is a real thing. It's hard to quantify that in a stat, but the stats that do try do that show Lavine isn't on the level you want him to be. You can see it when the game is happening. Do you honestly not see where Lavine needs to improve as a play maker or on defense?  &gt;Are you delusional? you've been exposed lol. Nothing you say is backed up and you continue to think that your opinions are an actual source of evidence for your argument.  Exposed? Again, I've shown numbers and gave examples from games, not sure what else you need.  &gt;All you do is try and attack my character which you know nothing about because you dont have an argument. Making assumptions about people also discredit you, its just very lazy and subjective. Just stick to objective facts, kid  When have I attacked you're character? You're the one saying things like ""delusional"", ""kid"", exposed"" and other demeaning phrases. I don't care at all, I just find it funny you're saying I'm the one attacking your character. You're the one making assumptions, I've never questioned anything you've said, I'm just addressing what you have said.  If you want to stick to objective facts then fine, the objective fact is Lavine has never been on a winning team. That should end the argument right there. We aren't discussing what Lavine is averaging or whether he should be an all-star, we are discussing is Lavine is a ""winning"" player, and if were aren't adding context to the objective facts, then Lavine is the very definition of a losing player.  Now obviously that's ridiculous and you need to look at his team, just like you need to look at how he gets his stats, now just what his final stats are."
2012 one was the best one Ive seen in a long time  Khris Middleton  Draymond Green  Tomas Satoransky  Will Barton  Jae Crowder  Kyle OQuinn  Quincy Acy  Darius Miller  Mike Scott

"Khris Middleton got picked 39th overall and is a 20ppg scorer with a career 40% shooting percentage from deep.   One of the last things I'd try to bring up with the Bucks is their drafting. Because everyone knows it's a shit show. All that matters is you end up with talent when you have picks, when you go all in and trade picks? You get talent. When you have Free Agent money? You get talent.   I really don't even think talent is an issue for the Bucks. They have enough for Giannis to win. If he wins though, it's Giannis' title. Nothing like the Nets or even the Lakers where Bron and AD share equal responsibility.   I am torn on whether or not they could have leveraged their picks and their prospects to get James Harden, or if he would have agreed, but other than that I really don't like the tone that the Bucks have been mismanaged to any degree. They've done really damn well."
Celtics Khris Middleton
"Rockets played some of their best basketball all season yesterday, and Khris Middleton made sure the Bucks played okay basketball all game. Gotta give credit where it's due."
Take Khris Middleton off my team in the off season before I become a fucking Lakers fan
"Nice, the list is growing...  - Brisbane Bullets: Kevin Martin, Khris Middleton  - SEM Phoenix: John Wall, Dant√© Exum, Zach Randolph, Josh Childress, Al Harrington  - Sydney Kings: Andrew Bogut   - NZ Breakers: Shawn Marion, Matt Walsh, Victor Oladipo"
"So was TMac's the first couple years in the league, and Khris Middleton took a bit to develop too. I am being patient with RJ, I think he has a lot of potential."
"Lol ok, I feel like you just want to cherrypick players to advance your narrative given that you're not talking about CP3, Khris Middleton or any of the other hundreds of players Jokic gets to the line more than. His FTA/FGA is higher than the vast majority of the league. There are stars who are not in that list of top 100 FTA/FGA. You're free to do your own analysis and cherry pick players to advance your narrative that Jokic is discriminated against."
"RJ ""Khris Middleton"" Barrett"
"WE WON A GAME OFFICIATED BY TONY BROTHERS! IT FEELS LIKE A MIRACLE!  Seriously though, what a fun, gritty game to watch. GG Knicks, that was a tough one. (p.s.- please don't let RJ Barrett be a new Khris Middleton against us...)"
He was feeling like Khris Middleton tonight
"I kinda like it lol. As a highlight poster, it‚Äôs hard not to post the usual ‚ÄúGiannis slams it down‚Äù or ‚ÄúKhris Middleton with the nice 3‚Äù.  Appreciate whatever creativity people put into their titles"
LaMarcus Aldridge might be unplayable against better playoff teams. Harden and Irving aren't getting over any screens and Aldridge can't do anything but drop. Imagine just giving up open 18 footers to Kawhi Leonard or Khris Middleton
I know he's an all star but khris middleton has a role as celtics killer and he plays it to perfection.

"For the Bucks, [I‚Äôd love this trade.](https://tradenba.com/trades/NOwOcZD90)   Bucks get: Draymond Green  Warriors get: Pat Connaughton, Donte Divencenzo, and PJ Washington  Hornets: get Brook Lopez, 1st round top 5 protected Milwaukee pick (the soonest one MIL can give up after the Jrue deal)  Why do the Bucks say yes?  Draymond Green is the perfect player for this Bucks team. With Draymond, we have a lineup of Jrue/Middleton/MLE Starter(PJ Tucker again maybe?)/Giannis/Draymond, and that‚Äôs guaranteed the number one defense even if Jabari Parker is the starter to be named later. Dray fits in perfect defensively, as Giannis can go back to the free safety role and terrorize while Draymond protects the rim and the paint and Jrue and Mids lock up the perimeter.   Offensively, Dray fits in as the main facilitator. Giannis and Jrue are okay to good as facilitators, but adding Draymond gives the offense a whole new dimension where Khris and Jrue play as off ball shooters while Giannis and Dray play a two man game.  Dray is an upgrade over Brook, and it sucks losing Donte and Patty Cakes, but the upgrade is worth it and I believe makes us top tier title contenders, which is something we are not with Brook Lopez starting.  Why do the Warriors do it?  Giving up the heart and soul of your dynasty isn‚Äôt ideal, but you‚Äôre getting 3 quality players back, 2 of whom still have great upside. We‚Äôve heard all year how the bench is weak, and it‚Äôs their downfall, because, well, it is.  Now with Klay coming back you have Steph/Klay/Wigs/PJ/Wiseman with Donte as a perfect 6th man/Klay recovery fill-in, and another solid bench guy in Pat Connaughton. Also, they have MIN‚Äôs 1st and their own. It‚Äôs possible they have a Steph/Klay/Cade/Kuminga/Wiseman lineup if the lottery falls perfectly for them.   And even if it doesn‚Äôt, they‚Äôll still in theory add 2 NBA caliber players in the draft. This year they have 3.5 competent players (Steph, Wigs, Dray, .5Looney), if they did this trade, next year they‚Äôd have (Steph, Klay, Wigs, PJ, Pat, Donte, GS pick, MN pick, .5Looney, .5Wiseman). So they go from 3 quality players to 9 (and 10 if Wiseman develops), restoring their depth from the title days. Replacing Dray with a young PJ Washington and adding two high quality bench guys that will mollywop other bench units. All of a sudden their bench goes from the steaming pile of dump it is this year, to a bench lineup of Poole/Donte/Pat/Paschall/Looney, a top bench lineup in the whole league to go along with world class starters.  Why do the Hornets do this?  Well, simple. You‚Äôre upgrading at a spot where you need to, and getting a 1st round pick. You‚Äôre the benefactor of having PJ Washington as a piece that GS wants over Brook Lopez, all the while Lopez helps you too.  Lopez is a clear upgrade over Zeller, and Melo/Rozier/Bridges/Hayward/Lopez is a playoff lineup for sure. Brook is tailor made to play with Melo, pick and pops would be deadly, and Lopez is great in the post which becomes an enhanced skill with Melo throwing entry passes to him.   PJ is a good young player, but Lopez helps you more now, and you get a 1st as well. No brainer."
And I‚Äôm comparing him to KD not fucking Khris Middleton. Guy I replied to said KD over Kawhi. On that standard he‚Äôs been underwhelming. You got any actual arguments instead of just saying ‚Äúlazy take‚Äù or is that your thing
Khris Middleton/Donte/2022 FRP
"Khris Middleton has the spatial awareness of an infant and the directional passing abilities of a fucking tornado, GARBAGE CAN"
"Khris Middleton fucking sucks, I cannot believe what I just witnessed.  He is simply bad at basketball"
Khris Middleton throws some really bad passes during a game
"Better yet, show me Khris Middleton talking to his teammate with zero, then some awkward commentary"
"I agree to an extent, but I think it might be different for us as regular folks who still have to worry about bills and stuff. Bobby Portis making 1/10 what Khris Middleton does probably doesn‚Äôt get salty about it because he‚Äôs still making $3.7 million, so it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs ever going around being like ‚ÄúDamn, I wish I could eat at this restaurant. Fucking Khris could though. Fuck that guy.‚Äù"
Khris Middleton and PJ Tucker is a close 2nd imo
"He's definitely got athleticism and ability as a slasher, so he shouldn't be relegated to a 3&amp;D. But his playmaking isn't great and he doesn't really have the handle or footwork to generate easy shots for himself.   If we had a legit #1 option, his efficiency would probably pop back up. But right now it's slid to like 55% TS.  I think of him like a... lower middle class Khris Middleton."
Khris Middleton would be a great fit for Portland.
Khris Middleton
"You must accumulate a minimum amount of makes in each category before you can qualify for the 50/40/90 club. Since this season is shortened at 72 games the minimum makes are 264 FGs, 72 3Ps and 110 FTs. Neither Satoransky who hasn't reached half of the minimum makes in any category and especially Snell (with 7 FTs) are close to qualify for the club given their currents rates.   This season the players who seem most likely to make the club are Tobias Harris and Kyrie Irving, after them I'd say that Steph Curry, Kawhi Leonard and Khris Middleton are next in line."
Khris Middleton?
Lol Bucks fans stay delusional. First they were trying to convince people Khris Middleton is an all-nba player and now this. Thank god they‚Äôll never win a title.
"Mentally I'm still used to 2014 salary cap where the highest paid players made 20-24 million per year so every time a great (but not elite) player like Tobias Harris, Khris Middleton and now Jrue Holiday gets a bag this big, my mouth always drops."
"alright a lot to break down.  Conley does get more possessions is by no means a full time point either.  mitchell initiates the offense far more and utah has multiple ball handlers.  I said mitchell wasnt as good as conley running the offense early in the year but he still runs more. ingles runs the offense quite a bit too and they often just let clarkson do his thing.  You are overselling the difference    According to nba.com jrue is 2nd on mil in pnr possessions with 4.3(behind middleton at 5.4).  Conley is 2nd on utah with 6.9(behind mitchell at 11.0 lol).  For isolation, jrue is 3rd on mil with 1.6(behind giannis and khris) while Conley is 3rd on utah with 0.7(behind mitchell clarkson).  Just from watching mil, they have really cut down on the giannis top of the key/iso stuff this year.   your eye test is producing some weird results.  it cant make much sense that conley is a better shooter yet jrue somehow is better at two of the main ways of getting 3 pointers off in catch and shoot and step back.  I disagree about spot ups at least. Stats again for spot ups  Jrue has 2.8 possessions at 1.1ppp, conley has 2.5 possessions at 1.21 so I dont think jrue is better there.  You overlook conley's floater a bit which is very good this year.    Yes utah's shooters help a bit but a counter is that would even encourage teams more to leave the weakest guy wide open.  It's never conley.  Jrue is shooting 39% this year but was also just average his last 4-5 years in NO.  That matters a lot in scouting report too and you should know as a pels fan. Bledsoe was shooting 40% from 3 early in the year and still at 36% and defenses could care less when he's open.  Advanced stats certainly have flaws and arent definitive.  Raptor is on 538's site, they'll explain it much better than I can.  LEBRON is proprietary unfortunately, not much info is out there.  I like them because they're all based on plus/minus and give you another perspective the box score just wont.  I will link an article on the math behind a lot of plus/minus stats below, the methodology is quite good.  Most of the plus minus just differ in what prior distribution they're using(usually box score based except RAPM)   In the same way the box score isnt definitive at all either. assists per game really doesnt mean that much either when it comes to measuring guys as passers.  So many good passes dont lead to assists and you need some teammate help etc.  3pt% doesnt really tell us everything about a guy's spacing effect.  Many guys are shooting better than steph this year on pretty high volume but it doesnt matter, he's clearly the best floor spacer in the league.  RAPM calculation(similar to other plus minus stats): https://squared2020.com/2017/09/18/deep-dive-on-regularized-adjusted-plus-minus-i-introductory-example/  NBA.com(where i get all my ppp stuff): https://www.nba.com/stats/players/spot-up/?sort=TEAM_ABBREVIATION&amp;dir=1"
"Khris Middleton, 3FRP, 3 Pick Swaps, and Hill gets you into the conversation for sure."
"I see why you ask since their box score stats are similar and it‚Äôs not that far off overall but you can‚Äôt just look at box score stats.  Conley was the best at running offense on the team before Mitchell hit his hot streak post all star break which was most of the year.  Utah fans would even admit he was better than Mitchell when people were predicting all stars.  Even when Mitchell sat Utah was humming on offense. He was low key doing what cp3/Lowry were doing.   Jrue is starting to show he might be that for Milwaukee and likely better than khris but most of the year it was Giannis/khris.  The covid recovery is a good reason but even before covid, he wasn‚Äôt as good as he is right now(tbf Middleton was also playing great) I know the ast/to are basically identical but will point to impact metrics and some eye test.  More importantly even though jrues having a very good year from 3, Conleys just a significantly bigger threat from 3 and defenses guard him that way and that opens up things for his teammates though it doesn‚Äôt show up in stat sheet.   Impact metrics just offense   Epm:  Conley 3.0 jrue 2.3  Rpm: Conley 2.42 jrue 2.69  Raptor: Conley 3.43 jrue 2.98   LEBRON: Conley 1.85 jrue 1.1"
Bc I didn‚Äôt mention it in 2-3 posts about he and Khris Middleton????
Jrue is definitely better than Khris.   Middleton is a natural 3rd option and Jrue allows his to settle into that role
"""What, there's no way that there was a better 2nd round pick than Khris Middleton the year he was drafted""  2012 - Draymond Green  Well, nevermind."
"Argentina beat USA with a team that had basically no NBA players in 2019. I'm not sure how many players exactly in their team is in Euroleague now but I'm sure it'll be somewhat competitive. For reference here's the team USA squad that year  &gt; The official 2019 USA World Cup Team includes 2016 Olympic gold medalist¬†**Harrison Barnes**¬†(Sacramento Kings);¬†**Jaylen Brown**¬†(Boston Celtics);¬†**Joe Harris**¬†(Brooklyn Nets);¬†**Brook Lopez**¬†(Milwaukee Bucks);¬†**Khris Middleton** (Milwaukee Bucks);¬†**Donovan Mitchell**¬†(Utah Jazz); 2014 World Cup gold medalist¬†**Mason Plumlee**¬†(Denver Nuggets),¬†**Marcus Smart**¬†(Boston Celtics);¬†**Jayson Tatum**¬†(Boston Celtics);¬†**Myles Turner**¬†(Indiana Pacers);¬†**Kemba Walker**¬†(Boston Celtics); and¬†**Derrick White**¬†(San Antonio Spurs).   Not great, but still respectable. If we are going by the worst of the NBA, e.g. Rockets, I think that Euro will win."
What's Sixers fans opinon on the contract now? Are you content with paying him that much? Do you think the contract is tradeable enough that you could package him for a superstar?  IMO its still pretty brutal but obviously it helps that he's suddenly morphed into Khris Middleton.
"Might sound crazy, but I think he can be a Khris Middleton type player. His game reminds me of him a lot."
"That‚Äôs a good point! Guess I could see his ceiling being around peak Khris Middleton (damn fuckin good all star). I do still think he should go back for one more year, I hate seeing talents coming out early and being too good for the g league and not good enough to get real playing time and their development suffers."
Some perspective on Khris Middleton. He had a rough game but he's still been great recently.   https://twitter.com/fmaddenNBA/status/1378555179843399680?s=19
"The bad thing about the west is the way I see it there's at least 6 teams that are second round quality teams, us included. Well, only 4 teams can go to the second round so something has to give once the first round is here. We'd probably have to be lucky with a favorable match up against a team that we don't match terribly against.  And say the Lloyd Christmas ""so you're saying there's a chance"" odds happens and we somehow made the finals......it won't clearly, I'd go so far as to say it's extremely close to zero but just hypothetical discussion here......we'd face Brooklyn most likely. We're not winning that arms race. It'd be insanely low odds to sneak a game, let alone win a series unless they had 2 of KD/Kyrie/Harden injured, but if that happened they wouldn't make it to the finals I don't think.  Even if it wasn't them Milwaukee we have matched poorly against for years (even pre-Giannis, Khris Middleton always has seemed to beat us up behind the school and take our lunch money) and that's still the case if last night was any indication. We've had success against Philadelphia this year, one of those times dominating them without Dame, CJ and Nurk in the game despite Embiid dropping 37. So basically we'd have to hope Philadelphia would make it to the finals and even then, I don't trust this team winning in 7 against them."
Khris Middleton
‚ÄúFuck the Celtics‚Äù- Khris Middleton
I have to agree here. Zion seems to have ‚Äúmore‚Äù repertoire in his offensive game. What I don‚Äôt understand is why Giannis doesn‚Äôt work on his shot or offensive skill in the off season. Like he plays with Khris Middleton. I don‚Äôt know why he couldn‚Äôt help Giannis with a consistent jumper like Kyle Korver did for Lebron James.
Some Detroit fan tried to argue Khris Middleton and Jerami Grant with me lol
"It‚Äôs more younger Khris Middleton because younger KM played off the ball more. Middleton hunts switches a lot more now.  MPJ as is does so much damage without the ball in his hands. But both guys it‚Äôs similar being tall high level shooters at both levels with good releases   The other one I considered was Shawn Marion with a better jumper. Hell never be what Shawn is on defense but cutting, transition, putbacks, rolling to the rim he does that a lot"
More athletic Khris Middleton
"Khris Middleton. Sometimes I feel bad for him but then I remember he‚Äôs rich, amazing at basketball, and seems like a good guy"
"It's been a weird stretch, but over the course of the season it looks like he's been getting a decent amount of calls. He's #29 in FTA per game, #39 in FTA per 36 minutes, and #37 in FTA per 100 possessions. He's #70  in FTA/FGA per game at 0.258, which isn't great, but still better than some notable players like Deandre Ayron, Chris Paul, Khris Middleton, Jalen Brown and Jayson Tatum."
Did yall forget Khris Middleton exists?
Khris Middleton is a more accurate comparison
The fact that you said you guys built around lebron better than Houston built around Harden automatically discredits your whole argument. Especially considering that warriors team Harden and cp3 almost beat swept lebron 2 years in a row even when he had kyrie for one of those years. Lebrons teams in his first stint wouldnt win one game against them while the rockets were a cp3 injury away from making it to the Finals. Also Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday are better than anyone those Cavs teams had other than Lebron the disrespect is insane to call them a ‚Äúrole player‚Äù.
"Houston got harden Dwight, CP3 and Westbrook, and they almost beat possibly the greatest team of all time. The bucks gave Giannis Khris Middleton, and then bledsoe/drew. Philly got Embiid, Simmons, Butler and Harris and should‚Äôve had Fultz but his situation was an anomaly. You guys made it out of a super weak eastern conference at the time but funny how once the Celtics and Magic got good you guys couldn‚Äôt get past them."

About to go 2018 Khris Middleton v Celtics on the whole league
"I mean from a homer perspective, I think Giannis and Middleton both worked pretty hard. Giannis went from selling trinkets on the street to beating Kobe to a workout (and 2x MVP I guess). Khris went from a throw-in on the Brandon Jennings sign-and-trade, to an All-Star and Boston‚Äôs Public Enemy #1.  Siakam was the first G-Leaguer to become an All-Star.   Brandon Ingram‚Äôs known to be a super hard worker, and I‚Äôd say he fits the modern game as well as Jimmy does.   Lebron‚Äôs 36...  I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more but those are the ones I can think of off the top of my head.   And also, Jimmy went to Marquette so I look at him in a very positive manner. I‚Äôm not tryna shit on him, but it seems weird to say he‚Äôs the only person with a comparable hustle to Westbrook."
wow that‚Äôs tough. they should trade him for a proven playoff performer like khris middleton
Can you combine trade exceptions? Like could they theoretically use the 27.5 and 7.4 to trade for khris Middleton? (Just a random example)
how much help does khris middleton need?
Khris Middleton casually catching a stray
"More than what you‚Äôd think, depending on how far you‚Äôre willing to stretch the word ‚Äúcan‚Äù. Isaiah Thomas (in 2 years he averaged under 20 ppg), Rip Hamilton and Tony Parker (averaging 17 ppg) were all no 1 offensive options for teams that did win a title. It all depends on who‚Äôs around them. If you ignore the salary cap you could build a champion with guys like Khris Middleton or Shai as your first option. But building rosters like the bad boys, mid 2000s pistons or early 2010 Spurs is a lot more complicated than having 2-3 max players come in free agency and then finding whatever functional role players you can."
"Allen in 2005 Playoffs vs Kings: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8GXhKH9CWg  Allen in 2002 vs Hornets: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWLdY9Txdis  He was basically a faster Khris Middleton, always active on the floor and always ready to drive to the hoop."
"Hey, trading for Brandon Knight got us (albeit accidentally) Khris Middleton, he did his part in the rebuild lol."
"If it gets that bad, just come over to the Celtics sub and mention Khris Middleton there. You'll be greeted with nothing but solemnity and seriousness- we put some respect on that name."
"And Derrick Rose, Tracy McGrady, Blake Griffin, Chris Webber, and Khris Middleton"
Khris middleton too
I can't even participate in game threads on /r/mkebucks if the game is close or we are losing. It's bad. Lol. Khris Middleton has got so much hate over the years from Milwaukee fans.
"Would Giannis count? I wouldn't really describe Khris Middleton and Jrue as stars. Jrue used to be, but he's a little bit out of his prime and Khris Middleton as a great player but I don't view him as a star."
He would be Khris Middleton except slightly less efficient
Projected starting lineup    Ben Simmons  Khris Middleton  Tobias Harris  Giannis  Joel Embiid   Sounds pretty sexy ngl
I thought Khris Middleton in 18-19 was an outlier and that he‚Äôd be a 3rd option at best. He proved me wrong
you spelt Khris Middleton wrong
Khris. Middleton.
khris middleton- michael redd
D'lo  Harden  Khris Middleton  KG  KAT
"I don't think Kyrie thinks the Nets are ""his team"". I don't think Ben Simmons thinks the Sixers are ""his team"". I don't think Khris Middleton thinks the Bucks are ""his team"".    It's just pure delusion for PG to think it was his team over Kawhi's. That's the equivalent of AD thinking the Lakers are his team over Lebron."
"... that‚Äôs not my point.   The whole OP explains why Nets half court defense isn‚Äôt as bad as advertised. You mentioned the change of style during the playoffs, and they lean towards the Nets defense.   My point is even with a highly rated defense like the Miami Heat last year, stopping them when the game slows down is impossible. In fact, based on the logic of the OP, getting stopped by them might be more probable.  This isn‚Äôt Giannis and Khris Middleton or Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown."
He really could‚Äôve been. He would‚Äôve never been what Joker was but I really think injuries robbed him of having a Khris Middleton type career
"This conversation is wild. The Raptors aren't going anywhere this year or in the foreseeable future. Thats facts. When healthy with a tight rotation they could probably steal a 4/5 series but that's about it.   The Sixers are not going to have success in the playoffs with Ben Simmons as their primary ball handler/second option. This is also facts. We've seen this with Giannis as well and Ben Simmons is very much a poor mans Giannis.  I think this Philly team as constructed will be a tough out in the 2nd round. Miami, Milwaukee, or Boston can definitely beat them. Indiana, or a even a healthy Toronto might be able to upset them as well but I think that's unlikely.   If you think Ben Simmons is better than Kyle Lowry, particularly in the playoffs, I don't really know what to say to you. Philly should be all in on Lowry, especially if they can somehow keep Thybulle and Danny Green.   Ben Simmons is a quality starter but he's definitely overrated. Overrated doesn't mean bad. Devin Booker is overrated and that dude is a flamethrower. Khris Middleton is overrated and he's a 50/40/90 guy. Overrated does not mean bad."
Name 10 more impactful players from precisely 16 ft. from the rim on the left side of the court in the second quarter than Khris Middleton.
I loved this matchup between the Jimmy Herro's and the Nikola Ross's.   Nah but forreal I hate playing T-Ross knowing every time he's gonna go for 30+. I was 100% expecting a bullshit 3 with the ball being flown about like that time Zaza Pachulia passed it to Khris Middleton buzzer beater vs us back in like the '14/15 season or whatever. **THANK YOU JIMMY**
"Now post Harris‚Äô playoff stats. LOL. I wonder why you didn‚Äôt post those.   And I never said that Khris Middleton was an ideal second option, either. No idea why you brought him up. I said the Bucks were better than the Sixers, not that I trust them as contenders."
Royce O‚Äô Neal has been good this year. Khris Middleton. OG
This is it. He plays like a taller khris middleton with rim protection most of the time
"It's not just scoring. Like, Khris Middleton right now is better than 36 year old Ray Allen was at basically everything. Yet Middleton can't make the ASG while Ray did. There's a ton more talent now than there was back then."
the khris middleton is stupid crazy like that one bounce off the rim more times than the kahwi shot
"Do you want me to go to the future and see how the Bucks perform this year? Lmao. You don‚Äôt get the point here. KG never had a caliber of a teammate like Khris Middleton who is in his prime while KG‚Äôs best teammates in Minnesota were past their primes Sprewell and Cassell.  Tell me who are you gonna compare Brogdon with? Sebastian Telfair? Heck even George Hill was pretty good and KG never even had a teammate like that besides the three players I mentioned.   Giannis had Brook Lopez, Brogdon, George Hill, Mirotic, etc. Who did KG had? Trenton Hassell?"
Khris Middleton says hello
"Exactly, with scoring and pace going up PPG is weighted less heavily, more emphasis on two way players, 3pt shooting and switching. 16 players over 25ppg and another 22 above 20ppg. 38 players over 20ppg and a good chunk of them shouldn‚Äôt be in the all star game. Guys like Fred VanVleet, Khris Middleton, Malik Beasley, Terry Rozier, Collin Sexton."
Khris Middleton
"Spencer Dinwidde and Khris Middleton is nowhere near Adams and Sabonis, and that is even just ignoring all the good shit Presti did, and the pure amount idiocy Joe Dumars did in trades."
"&gt; It‚Äôs nothing if you totally ignore where he has been drafting.  Joe Dumars drafted Khris Middleton and Spencer Dinwidde in the 2nd round within 3 years-- he's still considered a GM who didn't keep up with the times and was fired too late. It's not enough to be right about a player in a draft.  &gt;Yeah, they aren‚Äôt on the team anymore; he only traded Sabonis for Paul fucking GEORGE.  He traded Sbaonis and Oladipo. For 1 year of George."
Khris Middleton or Coach Bud (defensive scheme or rotations)
"Hypothetically, Giannis demands for a trade to Warriors, would both sides entertain this offer  Giannis for Wiggins, Wiseman, Timberwolves pick (Suggs/Kuminga), Warriors 2021 pick, 3 pick swaps (Unprotected).  So basically Giannis leaves Bucks and gives the Bucks a great haul with tons of assets. They'll still have Jrue and Khris to cash out if the want to or try to compete and hope for the fast development of their young guys.  Jrue-Wiggins-Middleton-Kuminga-Wiseman is a solid lineup as well.  Meanwhile, Warriors get another superteam.  Curry-Klay-Oubre-Draymond-Giannis. It doesn't matter if Giannis plays 4 coz Draymond will happily take that task."
"&gt;He must be taking a lot of ISO threes, since he's shooting an awful 37.7% on ISO possessions.  His EFG % is comparable to Khris Middleton,Shai,Kawhi etc though."
"I‚Äôm scared for Simmons in the post season. He‚Äôs much closer to Draymond than he is Magic. He can‚Äôt score at all in the half court. Tobias Harris being our most reliable perimeter scorer will be trouble, just ask the Bucks how Khris Middleton being their most reliable perimeter scorer has been for them."
&gt;Khris Middleton   &gt;   &gt;Kyle Lowry   &gt;   &gt;Joe Ingles  You can't tell me which one of these is the definitive #1 on the team though
"Ricky Rubio  Eric Gordon  Khris Middleton  Draymond Green  Clint Capela  with d rose/hart/ariza/pj/zubac off the bench would be a 60+win team imo. spacing,scoring,defense,depth,rebounding, etc. winning 60 games is a lot harder than it seems but this squad could do it"
"Kristaps Porzingis   OG Anunoby   Khris Middleton   Kyle Lowry  Mike Conley   Bench:   Joe Ingles, Thad Young, Rudy Gay, Danillo Gallinari, Maxi Kleber, Chris Boucher, Derrick Rose   Would this team win 60 games? Idk but it would win alot"
Khris Middleton
"On a nightly basis I think Khris Middleton waffles between being top-15 and somewhere in the 40s.   For a less heralded player though, I honestly have no idea how good Taylor Horton-Tucker is. I see some highlights posted here, but a lot of that, plus his general reputation, could just be the inherent Lakers bias."
Maybe bold claim but I see something centered around a Khris Middleton for Kristaps trade this offseason
"this. I'm a huge draymond fan, but we're not a long suffering minority. For every \*hur dur triple single donkey\* there's someone who goes absolutely batshit every time he stops a 3v1 fast break with psychic powers. Dude is a plus basketball player who you could generously say is a contender for all-star consideration. CJ mcollum level maybe. But he's not as good as Khris Middleton right now. Most people recognize that.  &amp;#x200B;  That being said playoff draymond is gonna tear the suns a new asshole."

Hello Khris Middleton Mk2
Giannis is gonna end up with every bucks franchise record except for the ones Khris Middleton will have.
The real answer here is Khris Middleton
Khris Middleton  CJ McCollum  Karl Anthony-Towns  Kyrie Irving (people will remember him just not how great he was)  Donovan Mitchell  Nikola Vucevic  Jimmy Butler  Kyle Lowry  Ben Simmons  John Wall   Kemba Walker (might remember him for what he did in college)  Trae Young
Kevin Love   Bradley Beal   Domantas Sabonis   Nikola Vucevic   Al Horford   Paul Millsap   LaMarcus Aldridge   Mike Conley   Khris Middleton   DeMarcus Cousins   CJ McCollum
Khris Middleton   Danuel House    Alex Caruso    DeAndre Jordan     Timelord     Hakeem     Clyde Drexler    Armoni Brooks    Nate Hinton    Damyean Dotson     Gerald Green      DeAroon Fox    Jimmy Butler     Justice Winslow
Khris Middleton is a 2x All-Star but I could see him kind of living in Giannis' shadow and not being remembered too much down the road... Trips to the Finals *could* bend that narrative though...
"Kemba Walker, Oladipo, Khris Middleton"
"It's tricky too because if voters split their vote between Embiid at F to squeeze him onto their first team and Embiid at C because that's his real position, he could end up not making it at either spot. That's what happened to Khris Middleton last year. Because of the way his votes were split up last year, he got snubbed from the list despite having more votes than some of the players that did make it."
"Sprewell/Houston/Stack/McDyess &amp; Finley were all good players but not capital ""S"" stars back in the day.  Most of them were much closer to a Khris Middleton/Sabonis level players, really good in their own right but not in the elite tier of players in the league.  The player from the 00s that stands out as underrated &amp; underappreciated all-time was Ray Allen.  Holy shit, Bucks &amp; Sonics era Ray Allen was so, so, so good.  Ray is more remembered as the 3rd guy on the Celtics and the role player on the Heat, but he was a capital ""S"" Star for the Sonics in 2006 hitting ridiculous shots &amp; carrying a fun but deeply flawed (their rotation of bigs was Jerome James, Reggie Evans &amp; Danny Fortson) team into the playoffs."
"I‚Äôm from Spain, so no NBA teams nowhere near me lol. I‚Äôm a fan of more than one team, because I like to watch multiple players. I like Embiid/Simmons, Khris Middleton, Westbrook, Randle/Barrett, KD, Pat Beverly, Gasol... so I watch them play as often as I can. I consider the Celtics to be my main team, I don‚Äôt know why. There‚Äôs a resilience in them that I like, and pretty much all of their current roster. So I always try to watch them, but man this season is being hard."

Khris Middleton is the greatest player in nba history when he laces up against the Celtics
khris middleton for boston
"That‚Äôll be a very interesting dynamic to monitor. The way they processed votes for player with dual eligibility last year was ... interesting ... and depending on exactly how the votes are distributed it could lead to some odd results.  It basically comes down to the NBA deciding last year that if a player gets votes at two position, he‚Äôll be ranked at the position where he got more votes (but all votes will of course count). For example Khris Middleton was eligible and received votes at both G&amp;F last year. Even though he had more votes than the 6th ranked guard, he didn‚Äôt make All-NBA because he got more votes at F than G and had fewer votes than 6th ranked F. Of course we don‚Äôt know the NBA will use the same ‚Äúelectoral system‚Äù this year, but if they do it could lead to interesting outcomes.  For example, imagine the following (completely hypothetical) vote distribution for Jokic and Embiid: * Jokic gets 70 1st team C votes and 30 1st team F votes. * Embiid gets 30 1st team C votes, 40 1st team F votes and 30 2nd team C votes.  If the same electoral system is used as last year, in this case Embiid is a 2nd team C regardless of who else gets how many F votes. Because he got more votes at C than F he‚Äôs ranked among Cs, not Fs. It‚Äôs certainly not a foregone conclusion both will make 1st team."
"well let‚Äôs see.   steph played with 2, maybe 3 hall of famers in their prime    james harden is on a bullshit 2k team that‚Äôs gonna sleepwalk to a title  lebron has had his fair share of help  kd literally has not won a championship without being on a super team   kawhi got his first ring on one of the greatest sports dynasties ever.   and what has giannis played with? khris middleton and jute holiday? hm."
Khris Middleton put the team on his back and got a win against Miami in the second round last year. Giannis didn‚Äôt even have a win against Miami. The only game MIL won was the one that Giannis missed. Khris Middleton was MIL‚Äôs best player that series.  Giannis is a regular season god but his play clearly falls off a cliff once he gets out of the first round. There is no chance that he‚Äôs a better playoff performer than AD. AD beats him across almost every single category and on better efficiency.
Ya‚Äôll don‚Äôt know about Khris Middleton.  He was literally the best player in that second round matchup against Miami. He managed to put the team on his back and win a game without Giannis.   Giannis didn‚Äôt even manage to beat the Heat last year. The only game the Bucks won came when Giannis was out.
Brook costs way less than Middleton (max contract). Personally I think Khris is still the better value.
Khris Middleton for giannis. Broken Dwight and Russell Westbrook for harden. He had a great cp3 who had injury problems in the playoffs. Harden was close to defeating the warriors without cp3
"Giannis has been to the ecf leading a team that had khris Middleton a his second option,no disrespect to him he's a baller but giannis is everything the bucks are"
"All votes you receive count for the position in which you receive the most votes. If Embiid gets more votes as a centre than he does as a forward, he‚Äôll make one of the teams as a centre.  This happened to Khris Middleton last year. Missed out on All-NBA despite having more votes than Westbrook and being eligible as a guard because most of the votes he received were as a forward and there were six forwards who received more total votes than him."
Khris Middleton on the 2016 and 2019 Warriors would be a massive upgrade over Harrison Barnes and especially Alfonzo McKinnie
"ok heres 20-25 (im not gonna do 25+) ppg scorers. i was curious so i looked. i think hes better (on offense) than only rozier and grant on offense (and im not even sure). i understand simmons plays a non-traditional role on the sixers, but seth is still wrong imo  List of 20-25 ppg scorers: Jaylen Brown, Collin Sexton, Julius Randle, Nikola Vucevic, Brandon Ingram, Paul George, Jerami Grant, Russell Westbrook, Jimmy Butler, DeMar DeRozan, Pascal Siakam, Jamal Murray, Malcolm Brogdon, Khris Middleton, Domantas Sabonis, Terry Rozier"
"I get you but I haven‚Äôt made any of those strawman arguments in my replies. Just simply refuting this notion that he is one dimensional. FYI I‚Äôm a curry hater and I don‚Äôt rank him top 1 or 2 in PG all time. I couldn‚Äôt stand the guy saying he‚Äôs one dimensional is all.  I rest my case lol what I can request is you reevaluate how you assess passing or rebounding in general. Melo isn‚Äôt an elite rebounder but he is not an ‚Äúaverage rebounder‚Äù. Fans standards are usually skewed against star players or hall of famers. There are 280 plus other players in the league with way ‚Äúworse‚Äù skill sets. But these guys that u call bums/below average are actually elite compared to an average joe. You don‚Äôt get to be elite with very glaring weaknesses. I would argue that in your assessment, your definition of above average passing comes from borderline top all stars or mvp candidates. Rubio is an elite passer he is not above average. He is able to orchestrate an offense even as a sub 40% non scorer/shooter. Above average passers are someone like Mike Conley, Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, Draymond (his bball iq and timing make him an elite playmaker but he‚Äôs still an above average passer, similar to Steph) and the like."
"Let it be known that the Rockets, led by KJ Martin, Kelly Olynyk, and DaQuan Jeffries are tied with the Bucks, led by Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton, and Jrue Holiday after the first quarter."
"Hes like a worse khris middleton rn, and you know what, on a good contract, thats the type of player you need"
I believe it did happen for Khris Middleton last year. He missed out on third team because his votes were split between guard and forward.
"booker a superstar??? lmao I‚Äôve heard it all, y‚Äôall are crazy. dude isn‚Äôt even a top 20 player. If you actually think he‚Äôs better than giannis you need to seek mental help immediately. he‚Äôs closer to khris middleton than he is giannis"
"Khris Middleton is nightmare fuel for the Celtics, I swear I have never actually seen him miss a shot."
"Westbrook has played with KD, Harden twice, Paul George, and Bradley Beal. Stop making it seem like he played with scrubs. He's had ample opportunity to play with elite, creme of the crop players. Meanwhile, Dame best teammate was LMA while Giannis only has Khris Middleton. A good number of guys would kill to have the teammates he's had."
"Brogdon, Jabari Parker, and even Khris Middleton didn't like him. They would do subtle jabs at him all the time during the season.   Giannis was like the only one lol"
"this is extra funny because khris middleton is the definition of a sleeper player...like he doesn't really particularly stand out so he flies under the radar, but you specifically remembered his name when the topic is the ugliest people in the nba"
khris middleton is up there
43 FTs to our 28  No Khris Middleton  Giannis fouled out  Donte fouled out  Back to back game   Refs clearly favoring the Wizards   And we still won. Fuck you Wizards and fuck you Tony Brothers.
He‚Äôd turn Khris Middleton into a superstar
"Michael Jordan, he was gambling like crazy, he was great on ball, but he definitely had a lot of bad moments off the ball  Currently :  \- Mason Plumlee : Malone always used him as a defensive sub, despite the fact that he's not even a better defender than Jokic, he plays hard, but he makes a lot of mistakes, fouls a ton, he's average at the absolute best  \- Kelly Oubre and Gary Trent Jr : those 2 together because they are the same, they play ultra hard, they put on a show, tap on the floor, get on a ultra low stance....but I've actually rarely seen them stay in front of anyone decent, and both aren't strong enough for the real big wings  \- Domantas Sabonis and Brandon Ingram most people think they are average/slightly below average, in reality they are terrible  \- PatBev : he's still useful because he's strong for his size and can switch but he fouls a toooon and a lost a lot of lateral quickness  \- Khris Middleton : he's still a decent option on big wings because of his size but since his injury a few years ago he' snot been the same athlete at all, he can't stay in front, he execute the scheme well, and can send his guy to Lopez/Giannis at the rim, but he can't stay in front of guys  \- Lou Dort : he might be THE best iso defender in the league, but he's not that good at getting trough screens, guarding off ball movement, he's a great defender, but he's gotten a bit overrated  \- Robert Covington : great help defender, a really mediocre on ball guy  \- Donovan Mitchell : the new Russ, still has a defensive reputation because he was good in college, he's at best average, probably worse than that.  \- And to finish the one that will get me downvoted, he's an awesome defender, but Ben Simmons isn't the DPOY"
"The biggest problem most fans had with Kidd was his defensive scheme. He emphasized early doubles and traps to the detriment of the defense, constantly leading to easy passes to cutters or spot up shooters. Truly constantly. The guy could just not put together a modern defense.  Offensively his main contribution was Point Giannis, which might be the best thing that happened to this team in recent history. Giannis never develops into the player he is today if Kidd hadn't insisted on putting the ball in his hands. However other than that his offense was pretty mediocre. He never embraced analytics on valuable shots. I still have flashbacks of Khris (and others, but it just hurts so much more when it was Middleton) taking a step inside the arc to fire off shots. He also wasn't very good at making the most out of role players.  Basically he was just bad at... everything."
"Khris Middleton, considering he didn‚Äôt even make this dumb list."
"The Bucks really think that coaching is the issue, I think they're missing the point. They've done about all they can personnel-wise, but I really think that their roster is still lacking if they want to make it to the finals. It's tough to go to the finals with Khris Middleton as your second-best player unless your best player is truly transcendent or you have insane depth. If you think about the recent finals teams, they almost all have either 2-3 legit stars or a really deep team. It's really hard to win it all when you've got guys on max contracts that aren't even all-NBA."
"We have PJ Tucker, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton,Jrue holiday   Also donte is a good defender, nobody will ‚Äústop‚Äù Harden,KD,or Kyrie but the bucks have the best personnel to slow them down"
"Khris Middleton has length, Dennis does not, an also I added two other people, holiday will more than likely guard harden"
"Nets fans are so spoiled, 3 top 10 players on one squad is just ridiculous. I can‚Äôt wait to spoil their playoff run. Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton are gonna have to be absolute dogs this Playoff run on defense. Portis also has a couple games to get back in rhythm"
Khris Middleton üíö
That Khris Middleton track everytime he scores a bucket is hilarious. Love it.
"Fuck it let's try this...   PG: Fred VanVleet  SG: Khris Middleton  SF: Bojan Bogdanoviƒá  PF: Christian Wood  C: Nikola Jokic  Bench: Seth Curry, Chris Boucher, Gary Trent Jr, Lu Dort, Yam Madar just for the hell of it."
Bucks paying khris Middleton 180 million to score 7 points üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I'll take Khris Middleton for the win.
Detroit did draft Khris Middleton so you never know
The downvotes on this are ridiculous. I whole heartedly agree I‚Äôve been a bucks my whole life seeing as I have always lived right by the Bradley/Fiserv. Khris Middleton is only a #2 guy because he plays for us he‚Äôs a #3 guy on most top teams. If Giannis had a legit guy like Dame or Beal the sky is the absolute limit for the Bucks. Khris always shrinks in the playoffs if we don‚Äôt play the Celtics lol.
"That's true, I guess I don't know where I lean on this because the Randle star experience is still in year one with some flashes before. Maybe a Khris Middleton/Klay type of guy would fit best here and is realistic."
His name is Khris Middleton 20/6/5.5  We just call him Kash Money

Wait until you experience a Bucks last second shot. Hint: It will be an extremely contested 3 pointer by Khris Middleton.
Khris Middleton as a no 1 option in a big market on a mediocre team would average 27 a game on 54% TS hit tons of tough shots and be glorified as some kind of superstar
Khris Middleton
"Not really sure about that honestly. Sure with Kawhi and PG in theory they have dudes they can throw at LeBron, same as the Nuggets can throw AG, MPJ, PJ Dozier and maybe JaMychal Green / Millsap at LeBron... but the Clips realistically dont have a guy they can put on AD. For the Nuggets, at least Millsap guarded him well last year in the playoffs statistically and if worse comes to worse they can try GIANT lineups with JaVale McGee. Joker can also hang with AD when AD is at the 5 (and statistically got the better of him on offense, shot 10-17 (ish - might have been 9-16?) against him in the WCF with like a 5:1 A:TO ratio).   I'm just saying that no team truly matches up well with the Lakers. The Nuggets I think actually matchup better than the Clips on the whole defensively at least. The Bucks are close as well, though Khris Middleton leaves something to be desired defensively. He's solid there but not as physical as AG or as athletic, to say nothing of fully engaged Kawhi of course."
"Fairly decent list, but recent All-stars should not be exempt because Khris Middleton is one of the best 3&amp;D players &amp; Klay Thompson is probably the GOAT3&amp;D.  7 Gordan Hayward is a playmaker &amp; a tone setter, you should feel weird putting him here because it is)  13 Tobias Harris is avg 20ppg, he's more of a dynamic scorer than 3&amp;D  19 When I think of Brogdan, I think Primary Ball-handler  25 Andrew Wiggins, haven't watched much GSW but in Minn, he was a scorer, has he turned into a shooter?  28 FVV was draining unassisted 35 footers in the 2019 NBA Finals while sharing the court with Kawhi, Lowry &amp; Beyblade"
"&gt;It does not matter. KD and Kyrie will treat any one on one defender the same. I don‚Äôt get why people can‚Äôt understand this yet.  &gt;They have too many weapons to be throwing doubles around willy nilly all while having arguably the three best iso scorers in the game.   Nope. Jrue Holiday is arguably the best one on one defender in the league. Massive difference between him and say...Kemba Walker.  &gt;And also, Giannis doesn‚Äôt guard KD. That‚Äôs usually Khris Middleton.  Not this season. KD plays the 4 now. Giannis has and will guard him."

"Yeah people really glamorise his mid range game like wow he can hit Khris middleton numbers from mid! But ignore the fact that him taking those middys when he's got a mismatch in the post isn't that great a shot in the grand scheme of things, and if he could use his 7ft frame to get to the rim more he'd actually have an argument for greatest offensive player."
"Khris Middleton has shot something like 64% from deep against the Celtics over a 2 or 3 year period in the playoffs, and constantly goes off and shots well vs the Celtics in the regular season."
"&gt;Jrue &amp; Khris are our closers and they‚Äôre better than Bogi at doing so.  Idk if they're better closers. You obviously don't watch Hawks games but Bogi is super clutch. Even with Trae Young on the court, Bogi is the guy making those big 3s with less than 2 mins in the game. Yes, Bogi is not the defender that Jrue is, but he seems to be a better leader and more clutch player. Also Bogi is showing right now that he can lead the offense for a very depleted team and get wins.  With the kind of defensive attention that Giannis gets, it's understandable why Khris Middleton thrives on offense.  Middleton is definitely a bucket getter not denying it, but he doesn't seem to be a great closer. I don't watch Bucks games a lot but I did watch all their games in the bubble playoffs. There are games he just can't close out despite being on the better team."

Bam Adebayo 20. Donovan Mitchell  21. Kyrie Irving 22. Ben Simmons 23. Rudy Gobert  24.  Jamal Murray  25. Zion Williamson  26. Trae Young  27. Zach LaVine 28. Russell Westbrook  29. Khris Middleton   30. Jaylen Brown   Then you've got guys like Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porzi≈Üƒ£is, Nikola Vucevic, Malcolm Brogdon, Domas Sabonis, Gordon Hayward, CJ McCollum, Kyle Lowry, Brandon Ingram, DeMar DeRozan, Mike Conley, Christian Wood that you could argue for the next 10 spots or maybe as high as 25-30th?"
"Because performing as the second option to **LeBron James** isn't as impressive as leading a team with your second best player being Khris Middleton or Cj McCollum. One set of guys is having defensive attention drawn away from them by the arguable GOAT, one set of guys has defenses focused on stopping *them*, so obviously there'll be a gap in performance."
Khris middleton
Never did. Giannis hasn‚Äôt shown me anything like what KD did yesterday. It‚Äôs really Khris Middleton and Jrue creating most of the offense. Give me 1 definitive moment in the playoffs from Giannis. There‚Äôs none
Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris are way more fraudulent than Khris Middleton and Eric Bledsoe but they get a pass ‚Äòcause they play for a big market.
"He is not being exploited in this series though. He is way more efficient than the rest of his team.  His team is shooting 50% TS, he shoots 57%.  His play style seems the least exploitable when compared to his teammates'.  You mean the system he plays in is exploitable. In that I agree, because no way are Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday shorting in thiers 40s (TS) under any other system."
"Some of you act like Giannis is a six year old that can only follow buds orders. They have plays that was obvious in the heat series they are simply not calling them what is bud supposed to do babysit them the whole game scream from the sidelines that maybe a khris Middleton iso is not a good idea. Bud isn't an angel in Giannis shoulders telling him to shoot a fadeaway over harden he also isn't responsable for every buck player shooting like shit, i swear there isn't a single coach that gets more flak than bud like Giannis and Middleton having been disappointing in the last 3 years"
" Giannis just didn‚Äôt grow up playing enough basketball and it shows. Some will say but what about Joel Embiid who also played basketball late? But Embiid consciously modeled his game after Hakeem. In this series there‚Äôs a visible skill and basketball difference between Giannis and others like  KD, Harden, Kyrie, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday. Giannis is truly a rim attacker, utilizing every bit of his physical gifts and strength. However he lacks that fluidity and handle to constantly create his own shot. He‚Äôs also not big enough ala prime Shaq to dominate a packed paint. So the shots defenses give him are the 3 point shot and 1 vs 1 mid range and those just aren‚Äôt his strengths. His free throws are atrocious too. I really hope Giannis can develop that outside stroke and dribbling. Lebron didn‚Äôt have much of a shot but he ended up doing shit like Lebronto.. hopefully Giannis can too"
Being able to do things besides run and dunk on offense.   Chris Paul is skilled. James Harden is skilled. Khris Middleton is skilled. Embiid is skilled.   Giannis is just insanely athletic (and tall) with basic guard skills. If he was as skilled on the offensive end as any of the other guys listed he‚Äôd be the best player in the world without a doubt.  It‚Äôs also the reason IMO why defense shouldn‚Äôt dictate  or influence MVP candidacy as much as offense bc you see how useless individual defense can become against individual offense in the playoffs. Limited offensive games get exposed in the playoffs.
He put them in a spot where an iso player like Middleton should easily be able to close out the game. Instead Middleton was trash in iso and Giannis was put into that situation which he shouldn‚Äôt be. They are both at fault but Giannis still had a better game than Khris
"If Giannis really is a liability, how does the team win games? You feel like Khris Middleton is a top 10 player? Because I don't know how else you sweep the Heat and take two games from the Nets upon the shoulders of two players (Khris and Jrue) who couldn't get into the all-star game with the version of Giannis that exists in peoples heads."
"But you can use the same argument for a bunch of other players. For example, to my knowledge, no other player has been left out of the All-NBA team on 27 ppg and 64%TS except for Zion. Another example, no other player has been left out of the All-NBA team with 20 ppg on 49/40/90 except Khris Middleton"
&gt;He reminds me of like a Tim Hardaway just a 3rd guy on a team.  People seriously forget how good CJ McCollum is. Tim Hardaway? Really?   He's a Khris Middleton/Kevin Love type player. Would be the 3rd best player on a championship team.
"The Nets only hope is to turn the game into a 1-1 between KD and Khris Middleton. When things are close between these two teams, that is what inevitably happens - KD and Middleton start trading possessions and KD gets the best of him.  The guys on Inside the NBA were harsh but correct - the Bucks are dumb.  It‚Äôs unfortunate that Giannis is so loyal, as they have needed a new coach who can help them win in the playoffs for three years now."
"&gt;You can‚Äôt force Giannis to learn to shoot or have a go to move  No disrespect to Giannis, but you totally can.  Granted that clearly that's not all there is to it, Giannis absolutely needs to become at least good at shooting jumpers (we go ""just wait until Giannis develops a jumper"" literally every off season) enough that defenses can't just flat out disrespect him.  Then again, this adds to the notorious coaching flaws and the fact that Khris Middleton is probably not good enough as a second option (again, no disrespect to Khris) if Giannis is 1st"
"I hope so, but something that seems particularly indicative to me is how Khris who's typically the most calm and composed player on our team and shoots about 90% from the line during the regular season will regularly miss free throws during tense games.  We need a good sports psychiatrist or something (hell Giannis was always a mid 70s% ft shooter prior to the Boston series a couple years ago when they first called out the length of his free throws and he's only gotten worse and worse since then, that seems like a lack of mental composure to me, though I'm not saying he'd be good from the line, but at least serviceable).  We've also gone from one of the best 3pt shooting teams on wide open attempts this year to hitting like 20% of them during the playoffs, that's absurd.  Middleton was shooting like 45% on contested attempts and like 17% on open looks last I checked."
"imagine the bucks but with kobe instead of khris middleton, popovich instead of bud, and gary payton instead of jrue üò±üò±üò±"
"He has the exact same TS% (49.4%) in the playoffs as Bledsoe did in the playoffs as a Buck. Granted his overall play hasn't been that bad, but 49.4% TS is just completely unacceptable. Khris Middleton had two of the worst offensive performances in the playoffs in games 1 and 2 against Brooklyn and he is still 54% TS in the playoffs."
I swear to god if I have to watch another game of Giannis standing in the corner guarding fucking Joe Harris while Khris Middleton and Jrue get shot over by the best scorer in modern nba history I will simply not do anything but I will be frustrated.
"How do you chalk this up? Is it the mental gymnastics from these Bucks players or coaching problem?   Giannis late 3, stupid fadeaway, having the ball in his hands less than a min left so he can shoot FTs.   On top of Khris Middleton trying to shoot over a locked-in Kevin Durant. People only see KD's offensive prowess but he was locked in on defense as well.   No ball movement which was their bread and butter.   Brook Lopez and not even playing Bobby Portis which would give them more mobility over Uncle Jeff."
"We don‚Äôt have the assets for a high end PG anymore unless someone is Portland willing to take Middleton, Donte, and Lopez for Dame which I won‚Äôt blame them when they laugh and hang up. The assets are gone. Our eggs are in the Jrue/Khris/Giannis basket. Just have to hope we can find some gems or a new coach can get this core over the top."
"I lol‚Äôd when I scrolled up to see your flair.   Ok I‚Äôm the coach, Where you want it Giannis?!? We riding you baby you want it in the post? Cool. How about we get a cross match make it even easier that ok? Do you one better let‚Äôs actually get the hobbled guy to guard you would that be ok? Result: Hobbled James harden **waves off help** , Giannis takes a fadeaway. Brick   Uhhh, ok, hmm how about we get Khris Middleton to drive and dish. Let‚Äôs get you an easy dunk! Result: Giannis drops a perfect pass hat woulda been an easy dunk .   Hmm. Damn. Ok just clear out! Jeff greens literal nickname is UNCLE! He‚Äôs 49 years old surely you can get an easy bucket on him! Result: Missed 1 point blank shot, gets fouled on the other and makes 1 of 2. Shooting 37% from the line for the series. THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT     Mfer please. None of that is coaching that‚Äôs on the player"
"I think that all of that doesn't get fixed with a new coach, but you definitely can persuade a player to make better shot selections. Middleton is always a bit streaky and I am not sure where Jrue went this series, but I do think that a good coach plays to players' strengths. The only player on the Bucks that can play iso effectively is Middleton. Everyone else needs action to create open looks, yet most possessions end up being iso with one of the big 3. A good coach ensures that this doesn't happen. It shouldn't even be in the system. Sure, end of quarter situations or end of games, you can go iso. If someone is extremely hot and feeling it, go iso, but the team should be running plays through Jrue, Khris, and Giannis to get great looks. The team has the talent, but it only seems to be utilized about 50-60% of the time."
"Okay, I would have liked to call you a dumbass because you sound like the Duterte apologists in my country, making people try to figure out what a guy should‚Äôve done when it‚Äôs his job to figure things out, but this game had some simple, basic things he could have done and they‚Äôd have won big.    1.	Attack Harden. Guy‚Äôs not 100%. Good coaches would instruct their guys to hunt him, because every guy on him would be having a mismatch.  2.	Abandon his godawful defensive scheme of packing the paint. Does he not see how the Nets are constructed? Three iso shotmaking creators who are surrounded by shooters.  3.	Why not run a simple pick and roll for Giannis as the roll-man (Khris and Jrue are good playmakers), or pick and pop for Brook. Take advantage of their strengths. Giannis as a roll man opens up the floor because he‚Äôll be defended on the roll and he can just pass it to the open man that would have been created because of the defense collapsing to stop his unstoppable foray to the rim.  4.	He can play big or play small. Play big with Giannis, Portis and Brook for some stretches to generate open looks inside, and the mix it up with going small with Akumpo as Center surrounded by 5 shooters (Forbes, Con/Middleton, Jrue, Portis).    Those are just the basic ones. A coach with a wider playbook and better X and Os would have taken Game 4 and 5 easily and demoralized the Nets. Nash must be sheepishly grinning rn for the Bucks not attacking Harden and not being too taxing on him."
"I mean if man's had ANY jumper or could hit his FTs, they probably still win. Khris Middleton has to take #1 option shots down the stretch because giannis is ben simmons level unskilled out of the paint."
"Giannis could‚Äôve played with Luka but said ‚Äúnah, I like Khris Middleton better‚Äù"
The Bucks in the playoffs will only be as good as the second star takes them ‚ÄúKhris Middleton‚Äù.   Giannis inability to shoot kills him in the playoffs.
Khris middleton Shouldve taken that shot were giannis fumbled the ball
I don't necessarily agree. I think the rise of shooting has made non insane athletes just so much more valuable.  Like even a guy like Khris Middleton without the 3pt shot would be a 16-20ppg guy despite his 50% shooting on long 2s. But now he is easily an all-star talent.  The thing is you could probably go to 35-40 players now who deserve to be all-stars. I think each team should be 15 players so double the all-nba players.  Damian Lillard goes from an efficient high volume scorer to a guy who isn't amazing at the rim and is league average at midrange and therefore probably pretty inefficient. James Harden about half of his scoring is gone. And his passing would be less valuable with fewer 3pt shooters.
Khris Middleton is right where the line is set for a good player.
KD is just a wannabe Khris Middleton
I have a confession. I‚Äôve thought for years it was Khris Middleton that was married to Kim K üòî
Nets gameplan to win:  - Lock down Khris Middleton  - Take more threes  - Fly Steph to Brooklyn immediately and have him put on the anthropomorphic James Harden suit
Khris Middleton
Khris Middleton sweats like a faucet.
Is Khris Middleton the sweatiest player in basketball
With stats out of the way lets actually do some comprehension  Is Joe 1/11 Harris better than Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday?
"&gt;Interesting twist in the All-NBA voting. Tatum was eligible as a guard and forward and had more votes than Kyrie, who made the third team as a guard. But Tatum was slotted as a forward because that was the position where he received the most votes.  Jayson ""Khris Middleton"" Tatum"
Yup. This was in 2019 and I can‚Äôt even say who the best player was: Donovan Mitchell? Jayson Tatum? Khris Middleton?
r/mkebucks shits on Middleton waaaayyyy too much. I‚Äôve had pessimistic takes from time to time there but so many people want to make Khris the scapegoat for everything.
How do I bet on Khris Middleton?
Philly‚Äôs bench isn‚Äôt Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday.  Also just so ya know I‚Äôm not reading the novels you‚Äôre writing right now lmao
"KHRIS MIDDLETON FOR THHRREEEEE!!! from Giannis üé∂Money, Money, Money, Monay... Monnnaaayyüé∂"
Isn‚Äôt Melo considerable bigger and heavier than Khris Middleton
"Having watched Cade Cunningham, Khris Middleton does not come to mind in terms of his game"
"You are right no reason to come at me it was about who‚Äôs the better player between khris Middleton and joe Johnson and for me it‚Äôs joe Johnson I never said he‚Äôs the ultimate player, the problem was that your Batman was supposed to be josh smith if you are talking about his time with the hawks and well we know how that turned out"
&gt; Khris is the ultimate guy to watch for anybody who isn‚Äôt super athletic  This is understating it. Middleton might literally be the least athletic starting wing in the league. It's a massive credit to him that he's so good with less speed and explosiveness than Joe Ingles
"He was, but it's not like he was ""elite athlete"" athletic.   He had a little bit more lateral quickness, but you were never going to see Khris Middleton posters or anything."
"Khris Middleton essentially will never ever be as good as Joe Johnson and idc what anyone says. And Middleton is a good player. No shade at all. But this is Iso Joe, Check That Hoe we‚Äôre talking about."
"Prime Joe Johnson more clutch, better ballhander both really fundamentally strong tho, khris Middleton is a baller"
Because one has Joe Harris as their next best player and the other has Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday
"?!?! they shouldn't even be able to sniff the Bucks' jock strap. cmon now. KD is a monster, but no one else on that team is even at a Khris Middleton level, let alone Giannis. The Bucks should dominate, and that's exactly what I'm expecting: domination. Nothing less than that should happen tonight."
&gt; Idk why people don‚Äôt think he is one  This is the first season Murray averaged over 20 points a game. Saying Murray is a superstar should feel as sour as saying Khris Middleton is a super star.    They are not. They are stars for there team who will be multiple time all stars. But they are not superstars.
"Because KD is on a top-heavy team with the top missing, if you were playing against a KD team with a normal supporting cast I'd agree with you but you're playing against a KD team with $75 million of their salary sitting out with injuries.  Giannis is playing with 3 solid starters, KD is playing with Joe Harris and a bunch of minimum salary guys, losing to them would be a huge choke job. KD's entire team costs less than Khris Middleton, yeah that's partially about Middleton being overpaid but it's also a huge indication of just how little of a team KD has left around him."
"I expect KD to step up. He's an all-time great scorer. I imagine he doesn't want to be outplayed by Khris Middleton or Giannis. Even if both Kyrie and Harden are out, the onus on KD, he should absolutely give one of his best performances, it's on him."
https://fansided.com/2020/09/17/khris-middleton-missed-nba-selection-outdated-positional-designations/ It changed this year?
Is Bogdanovic not a young Khris Middleton clone?
"Disappeared right when James Harden and Kyrie disappeared?   Lol save it, if your stars aren't there, don't blame the role players. It's over, blame the nba for not giving an off-season.    Don't expect Joe Harris to out duel Khris Middleton."
Depends on embiids knee and Khris Middleton continuing to play like KD
I was thinking Khris Middleton with more D
"Yeah. Diet Kevin Durant, also known as Khris Middleton needs some love. KD and Khris are wet from mid. So is Kawhi and CP3. I just wanted some recognition for my guy. You're correct in everything you said."
"Definitely, he was the Bucks best player in Giannis' rookie year after coming over in the Brandon Jennings trade, along with a young throw in named Khris Middleton"
Khris Middleton and inconsistent play
"You know, I think Khris Middleton has not gotten enough credit for the work he's done on Duncan Robinson and Joe Harris these first couple rounds.  He's not only been very good on offense but he's been the main matchup on both those guys and neither one has really taken over with their shooting."
Khris Middleton got back to his level
"1) Wind up is not a requirement for a flagrant foul.  &gt;If contact committed against a player, with or without the ball, is interpreted to be unnecessary, a flagrant foul‚Äîpenalty (1) will be assessed.  &gt;If contact committed against a player, with or without the ball, is interpreted to be unnecessary and excessive, a flagrant foul‚Äîpenalty (2) will be assessed.  https://official.nba.com/rule-no-12-fouls-and-penalties/#flagrantfouls  2) There have been plenty of flagrant fouls called in these playoffs just for contact to the head. For instance Duncan Robinson's flagrant foul against Khris Middleton."
Khris ‚ÄúMichael Jordan‚Äù Middleton
"Feel so bad for the ECF teams who have to endure marv Albert constantly messing up players names  ""Giannis for the game winning 3, and now their saying its Khris middleton"""
Ok so Steph Curry/Book/AG all faced the same racisim growing up as say Lebron/Draymond Green/ Khris Middleton?  THE FIRST 3 AINT TRUE BROTHA'S.  Steph's curry's dad is light skin to begin with and his mom is basically white.  Just looking at Steph I can tell you he aint black.
"Mark is so biased against the Bucks it's hilarious. Harris got called for pushing Middleton into Durant early on. Mark said ""no contact"", they showed it again and in slow mo Harris took his elbow and smashed Khris in the back and Mark was still adamant there was no foul. Dude is so annoying to listen to"
Unless Joe Harris goes full Khris Middleton and Blake Griffin goes back to prime form
hopefully Khris Middleton can help cause his jumper is...     # WET
"for those uninformed, that g-leaguer was Khris Middleton hehe"
Tres hombres ain‚Äôt enough to stop Khris Middleton.  You gonna need more hombres.
Yeah that should should expected though nobody is saying Khris Middleton is Kevin Durant.
That Khris Middleton 4 point play is damn near identical to that KD foul bait in the fourth quarter lmao.
"Lmao if y'all are seriously arguing Khris Middleton is better than Nikola Jokic that's wild. I usually ignore those kind of takes but this is too funny. Just to clarify:  So the Bucks probably get swept if James Harden is playing. Y'all were a shot away from being down 3-0. Now Kyrie goes down and the Bucks have the luxury of playing a team whose 2/3 stars are out. Plus Khris plays next to Giannis, one of the best players on Earth to take defensive gravity off of Khris.   Meanwhile we all know how much of a playoff beast Jamal Murray is. So the Nuggets are clearly missing their second best player and it's blatant when you watch their offense right now. Their second best player has basically been Monte Morris.   And your best data/argument for Middleton over Jokic completely ignores the MAJOR injury scenarios present. That's some impressive critical thinking skills ya got there."

Where all the Khris Middleton slander at
Khris Middleton is dialed in right now
KD is just a 7ft Khris Middleton who got the chance to play with the greatest backcourt in nba history
"IMO the only reason Khris Middleton isn't mentioned with PG and Butler is because the other guys got opportunities to be the guy for playoff teams early in their career, whilst Middleton was always the other Bucks guy"
Khris Middleton is good
Khris ‚ÄúJR Smith‚Äù Middleton
Khris Middleton guarded by three players and knocking a 3 in all their faces is not something you see every day.
"holy shit Khris I didn't expect that to go in. then again, it's a wild Middleton shot, so it'll usually somehow find the net"
KD without Westbrook or the greatest shooters of all time is just a 7ft Khris Middleton
KD really out here terrified of Khris Middleton
"Middleton gotta go with bud, how many times y‚Äôall gonna try a Giannis and Khris led duo"
Khris Middleton and CJ McCollum seem like the same player to me
Is it Khristoper Middleton or Khristian Middleton? Or just Khris?
"I mean the nets have really good ball movement in comparison to the bucks at least.  It's also more that when the bucks have the ball every posession is either giannis drive, giannis take a wide open shot and miss or Jrue/middleton play ISO.  It feels like they're just taking turns and the rest of the team just stands around.  Particularly in the 4th.  It's not really the lack of ball movement that is killing them, it's their inability to make an open three and their OFF BALL movement.  When one of Giannis, Khris or Jrue have the ball the rest of the team looks like they just stand in one spot and wait for their defenders to leave them.  There is no off ball screens or double screens or any sense of trying to get open or making a play."
One team has Joel Embiid. The other team has Khris Middleton. As a huge fan of Middleton's game this still seems like an important distinction.
Khris Middleton szn
I don't root for them to fail per say but i do hope for slight underperforming. Anyone who's trade value i want to dip so it becomes easier for my team to acquire them. So atm it's Paul George Khris Middleton and Ben Simmons.
Khris Middleton MVP
"No, PG is definitely the problem. He takes up too much of the salary cap, whose offensive production is spotty in the post-season and could be replaced by a player with a much smaller cap hit.  When Reggie Jackson shows you up on a minimum deal, what's PG's value for the team? His defense is still good, but I wouldn't say elite. It pains me to say but after watching both him and Middleton, I'd rather take Khris at this point."
"I remember gettin downvoted for saying Khris ""Black Ingles"" Middleton cause they kinda look alike to ne"
"It‚Äôs truly baffling watching these games and trying to figure out what the Bucks are trying to do. I only saw like the last 1/3 of this game, but it just seemed like every offensive possession was either Giannis doing a YOLO jumpshot, a reckless charge at the rim, or Khris Middleton taking a contested jumper. There was no movement, no passing, and nothing to get the Nets out of their schemes. It‚Äôs hard to even say that it ‚Äúworked‚Äù this game considering how low their points and percentages were. I just don‚Äôt get it."
I think mainly CJ knows what it feels like to be the Khris Middleton on a team lol
"""Why Khris Middleton with Doron Lamb, Tyshawn Taylor, and Darius Miller still on the board?"""
"First off, great work on this and the Giannis post. I love seeing the takes that have aged wonderfully *and* those which have aged awfully.   That said, as a Pistons fan (who does not in any way speak for other Pistons fans) I must step up and admit I nothing'd Khris Middleton. I'm not great with scouting prospects on my own and in his rookie year, I saw little to suggest he was going to be a piece moving forth. I figured a second rounder only seeing 27 games of action probably didn't have a lot going on in the way of potential.   I basically figured he and Kim English were birds of a feather (i.e. disposable picks)."
"Middleton has hit some clutch ass shots and that generates more hype, also coming up big in clutch moments plays a lot into that narrative. However, Giannis has one of the greatest Finals blocks of all time and then helped create the turnover the alley oop, so he has his clutch moments too.  Khris has been great and this series has made me a fan of his, but Giannis is just a different beast."
"Basically Lebron/KD/Giannis etc. would probably be getting offers for like $70m/year or more in a free market. With all that money being thrown at the top 5-8 guys, the upper mid-level players wouldn‚Äôt be making as much.    Instead, the league has max contracts, meaning teams can‚Äôt pay Lebron what he‚Äôs really worth. This has a cascading effect of leaving teams with more money to play with, and because they can, they pay players like Middleton the max. Now maybe after this postseason you could say Khris would be earning about the same, but he‚Äôs still definitely not getting Giannis money in a free system."
"Khris Middleton shoots 15-33 for 40 pts. media/Twitter: omg what a legendary game, he should be considered finals MVP‚Äù  Booker goes back to back 40 pt games shooting over 50% both games. Media/Twitter ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a chucker and shooting his team out of games‚Äù"
https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nba-player-projections/khris-middleton/
"This going one of two ways CP3 and Book get ejected after hitting the 3D on Scotty or, Giannis gets ejected for shaking it one too many times when he tinkles and Middleton gets ejected for looking at Tony while Foster his yelling at him.  (Pls don‚Äôt hate me Khris I really like you)"
"Bruh, the Suns are letting Khris fucking Middleton drop 40 on them, KD would average 60 in the finals"
"Devin Booker can certainly act. So can James Harden.  Khris Middleton, on the other hand, hams it up terribly."
"It's a fantasy of mine for Khris Middleton finals mvp; he's my favorite player, but Giannis is clearly playing better."
"That's part of what causes him to be overrated imo. These games haven't rlly been consistent in the playoffs or regular season, and his game hasn't evolved to the point where he's very impactful when his shot is off the way a Paul George (or even Khris Middleton) still can be - yet there's probably people here who would put Book on PG's level.  The flashes of playmaking are definitely there though and if he can improve his decision-making and limit turnovers then I think he gets much better at helping on those off days."
"Khris Middleton is averaging 25.4 PPG in this series, on .537 TS%. Giannis is averaging 32.2 PPG on .634 TS%.  Literally the only area where Khris even approaches Giannis in value is as a scorer, yet Giannis is scoring far more on **way** better efficiency.   There is literally no argument to be made. Even trying to make it is a massive insult to Giannis."
"He‚Äôs not saying Middleton should win FMVP, just that he‚Äôs probably going to get votes. People are making a big deal of nothing lol.  CJ even said Giannis should win the award just that Khris deserves some votes too."
"Exactly lol people are just running with ‚ÄúCJ disrespected him‚Äù. Nobody, not even CJ, thinks Giannis wouldn‚Äôt win the award, just that Khris Middleton deserves (and will likely get) some votes."
CJ and 2 firsts for Khris Middleton? You're joking right?
"Of course CJ prefers Middleton, he's a poor man's version of Khris who has little actual impact on the game. Hyping up Khris likely makes him feel better about his game.   But he's a got a bag tho!"
"Giannis is obviously the Finals MVP if the Bucks win, but it's still nice seeing Khris Middleton finally get some of the recognition he deserves."
"I mean yeah, but Giannis has been doing the same thing for years and it's been shut down many times. Youre arguing against Giannis' playstyle but he played way more aggressive the last few playoffs and has been passing better and getting a lot more oops from Jrue this year's playoffs.   If anything the argument holds up better because Cp3 and book get a lot of the calls we wish Middleton got. Im not a fan of the jumping into people shit either and that's a lot more booker/Cp3 realm than it is Giannis. Khris will never get those calls because he's 6'8 and isn't in commercials, but it is what it is.  We both have biases but from my side Giannis is a lot less aggressive in the paint on offense and a more intelligent player than the last few years so it feels weird you're complaining about the part of his game he doesn't force as much."
That‚Äôs twice as many as Khris Middleton and they have similar shot profiles.
Khris pushes off as well but this sub doesn‚Äôt care.  Middleton is Mr. ‚ÄúUnderrated‚Äù on this sub
jrue holiday and khris middleton
Atlanta was insane when we won too. I'll never forget screaming my lungs out as Trae Young rode by in the parade :)...  ...in the dream I had the other day before Khris Middleton slept with my wife and clogged the toilet before bouncing.
Giannis + Khris Middleton
"I definitely don't think it's over but I'd be amazed if the Suns went into Milwaukee and pulled off Game 6  The Bucks and their crowd are gonna be fired up more than ever before and the energy will probably be overwhelming for the Suns. Booker has given the Suns 40+ in two straight games and they came up with Ls both times, in one of those games the Bucks only shot 24% from 3, in another the Suns were at home and also got 21 from Chris Paul.   I don't think it's likely Booker replicates his performance from the past two games, and more importantly...the Suns have not stopped or so much as limited Giannis a single game in this series. He has gotten over 30 in every single game, that is the constant. So you can be assured he will more than likely do the same...and in the event that happens, he'll only need just one of Jrue or Middleton to have a big game again and the Suns are buried (Bucks have won the 3 games that Giannis got big contribution from either one of them, and even in the 2 they lost they were close battles with Jrue and Khris playing terrible) If the role players are also shooting well that'll do the Suns in too. Bottom line is there's a wider margin for error with the Bucks and very thin margin for the Suns and the Suns are going to be on the road in a hostile environment.  The Suns will probably need another big performance from Booker, and from Paul, and their role players will have to be involved hitting 3s, probably need Ayton to have a solid game as well. All of this has only happened in 2 of the 5 games. Other huge problem is defensively Ayton is literally the only one on the Suns that can even halfway bother Giannis....and without Ayton on the court the Suns have literally no size. Far too many things working against Phoenix. Would be an amazing feat or huge choke from Milwaukee to steal it on Tuesday"
"How close do you think you actually were?  If today's Khris Middleton was magically inserted to the Pelicans from 2017-2019, do you think they would have a been a contender?"
"This didn‚Äôt happen. You‚Äôre thinking of Khris Middleton, he made that shot."
"If you don‚Äôt have Curry as your greatest shooter of all time your brain doesn‚Äôt work, it‚Äôs literally a fact at this point, there‚Äôs literally no way you‚Äôre telling me Khris Middleton is a better shooter."
I believe he AND Khris Middleton were both 60 overall. Draymond was also a 61.
The 3rd quarter was insane.   ***    Time| Play-by-Play| Score ---|---|---- 10:35	|	Khris Middleton **makes** 26-foot three point jumper (Giannis Antetokounmpo assists)|67 - 63	 9:58	|	Devin Booker **makes** 18-foot pullup jump shot	|67 - 65	 9:44	|	Brook Lopez **makes** 27-foot three point jumper (P.J.

The only two stoppages in these entire stretches were due to 2 turnovers (1 each).
The Khris Middleton Special
"You know how us fans love to fantasy book folks to teams??? This is why the shit doesn't work in real life. Ego - healthy and unhealthy - can stand in the way. Kristaps is still young as fuck and even though he had an injury his expectation is to be an all-star. He's now in the west (harder division) playing alongside another generational talent who seemingly has an ego as well.   Let's just be fucking honest - all last year it was the Luka show in Dallas. NOBODY media wise was talking about KP!!! N-O-B-O-D-Y. Luka was on the graphics. Luka had teh press. Luka even had teh online highlights. Luka ran this sub - though small in footprint, another statement of how KP was the clear 2nd player.   KP in a perfect world would have been traded to a team that just needed a hero as obviously he feels he's such. Intead, he's asked to be Khris Middleton while he thinks he's Giannis."
"There are only 4 superstars in this league. Look at fans AllStar voting over the last 4 years. Only 4 players have received most votes as Captains to lead their conference.   LeBron - 4 times Giannis - 2 times Curry - 1 time KD - 1 time  That's it. That's the superstar list. See the current jersey sales numbers and it's the same top 4.   Any other player labelled a superstar has some of the attributes, but not all.   Khris Middleton is on the verge of entering the 'star' tier if Milwaukee complete the job."
"Superteams have existed since the beginning of nba history.   Plus, you're only talking about Giannis/Booker. Tell me how the Bucks got Jrue Holiday? Khris Middleton? How did the Suns get CP3?"
"A superteam hasn't won since 2018.   Both these current teams in the finalls basically have their own big 3s, and Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, and CP3 are not ""loyal guys"" drafted by these teams."
i have an unexplainable dislike for khris middleton so i root against him
Probably Khris Middleton and Allan Houston.  Midd is a little taller but the gangly wing shooter that could heat up even tho he wasn't really an elite guy.
Khris Middleton oddly enough reminds me of Joe Dumars. In the best way(s) possible
Khris Middleton or Kyle Anderson
Danny Granger and to a lesser extent Khris Middleton give me Mullin vibes.
"I mean, Khris Middleton was a lower tier all star and wasn‚Äôt even one this year, and Jrue hasn‚Äôt been an all star for years.   The Bucks are a very good well made team, but they aren‚Äôt a super team."
"Khris Middleton is a fucking baller. He kicked our ass in 2018 - we barely pulled that out. He has extended his range since then, lol. The pull up 3 pointers are filthy/Steph like at times."
Team B has more size and strength. All it‚Äôs missing is another non-all star in Khris Middleton
"We complain about players flopping and selling contact, but it‚Äôs the refs‚Äô fault because it works.   There was a play in game 5 where Middleton had the ball with the play clock running down and CP3 was all over him. Paul hit him in the head just a little and Midd clearly flopped and fell to the ground. It felt weird to watch because it was way out of character for Khris, but it absolutely was a foul and he only got the call because he flopped."
Khris ‚ÄúRodney Dangerfield‚Äù Middleton
"Jrue Holiday, Donte DiVincenzo, Khris Middleton, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Brook Lopez.   Jeff Teague, Bryn Forbes, Pat Connaughton, PJ Tucker, Bobby Portis."
Wym.. khris middleton is also pretty reliant on midrange shots
I mean shit the star power is so lacking this year that Khris Middleton and Booker going 40 to 40 every game is just an example of how ASS they are. Then you got Jrue holiday stepping up recently but who cares cuz Kyrie lol. Giannis averaging 40 and 12 and getting Lebron type blocks every game but who gives a shit cuz we like the sound of KD vs Bron ü§©
Remember when the Bucks traded Brandon Jennings for Brandon Knight and Khris Middleton as a throw in?
"""I remember the days when Brandon Knight was our best knight. As Giannis has grown, so has the dignity and respect of this house. We have not known hope like this since the days of Lew Alcindor and the Big O and it's all thanks to Giannis, The King in the East!""  \- Khris Middleton"
Khris Middleton is good
"I think that was prior to the bucks, neither can matchup with Khris ""MJ"" Middleton or Giannis"
Easy. Chris Paul and Jae Crowder have been on the roster for all of 7 months. Giannis was drafted by the Bucks and Khris Middleton was a trade throw-in years ago.
Also get Khris Middleton as a throw-in from the Pistons
"Bucks with Sam Cassell, Ray Allen, Khris Middleton, Giannis, and Kareem would be pretty dope with a bench of Oscar Robertson, Sidney Moncrief, and Michael Redd."
More like Khris ‚ÄúJR Smith‚Äù Middleton dude will make the most difficult shots but miss the open easy ones.
I think it's Khris Middleton who has the most 3PTs this postseason.
Khris ‚ÄúPay Me My Fucking Money‚Äù Middleton
I couldn‚Äôt get over how out of nowhere he says that Khris Middleton is Scottie Pippen. Then backtracks for a second before doubling down
"Windhorst sucked that pod. Lowe and Nurse were having an interesting dialogue and he just comes in with ‚ÄúKhris Middleton is Scottie Pippen, I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs Scottie Pippen but the bucks have a two time MVP and Scottie Pippen.‚Äù   huh?"
Khris ‚ÄúThank God He‚Äôs Not Tobias Harris‚Äù Middleton
"If Bucks win it will cement the legitness of their big 3. It‚Äôs going to change so much about the league the next few years. Khris Middleton is going to get so much more respect and likely make 2-3 more all star teams with a chance to be a HoFer. Also I think the Bucks will have at least one more all time great 60+ win regular season in them, maybe even twice. Now that they know their play can beat a classic roster like PHX they will enter playoffs with a new level of confidence. I‚Äôm really glad Giannis might get a championship so early right after signing the supermax. It‚Äôs going to completely change Milwuakee into a new age Spurs type of team"
What would ‚Äúelite‚Äù mean then? Top 10? And you think Khris Middleton lacks confidence? Lol
"Khris ""Salary filler in a Brandon Knight trade"" Middleton"
I‚Äôm not sure he really knew where Khris was besides knowing he was behind him. Giannis didn‚Äôt really tip it that close to Middleton lol.
Y'all got it all wrong. Apparently it was ‚Äôupset for Khris (Middleton)‚Äô as in ‚Äôupset for Khris to lose his FMVP‚Äô. Solid question from the reporter
"lol nah, theres  difference between being hot and being unstoppable. I didn't mention unstoppable but Khris Middleton legit cannot be stopped no matter how good of defense you play when hes hot. Omar Casspi is not on the same tier nor is most players"
ya Khris Middleton in Kelly Oubre‚Äôs body would be considered like a top 10 player amongst casual fans lol
Khris Middleton would be a star if he wasn‚Äôt goofy looking.
"Man after the 1st q I was hyped for phoenix, I really like cp3 I wanna see him win one. They got outplayed bad in the second quarter, freaking holiday Giannis, connaughton shot lights out and sneaky khris Middleton. Dude is the best low energy player I've ever seen. If the bucks win Middleton has got to go down as one of the greatest performances by someone you don't necessarily expect to be in the spotlight. Much love to the bucks they've had a tremendous season"
"Look, shitcunt.  Jrue Holiday is one of the best, if not the best, lockdown defender in the league. He also dropped a bunch of points on the Nets heads today.  Similarly, in this Finals series, Khris Middleton has done more than Harden ever did - and with a whole lot less cheating as well.  So you can take your whining about the quality of the players in this series and shove it.  Oh, and on the other side - it's a coming out party for Booker. He's played amazingly.  And if you can't see that, then you're a LA Lakers fan, which is to say you're a self-obsessed fuck with with zero respect for the game or it's history."
"We‚Äôll Bucks didn‚Äôt know that Khris Middleton was gonna ascend this high   And probably didn‚Äôt think Giannis would be 2x MVP either   They were probably banking on them being good complimentary pieces to Jabari Parker but the universe had other plans in mind   Now the moves they made adding guys like Jrue, Lopez and co once they saw what they got in Giannis and Middleton - those are üëç"
Where's that flow chart that shows Khris Middleton going from Kyle Kuzma to Michael Jordan? We need one for Jrue where he goes from Eric Bledsoe to Gary Payton
"right? you think history is going to be kind to jrue fucking holiday taking over this game? no shit if multiple top 100 players and a couple top 20 all time were playing in the same finals, and it was going this way, people would be all over it. You cant compare khris middleton to james harden or devin booker to even kyrie"
I honestly think Khris Middleton would get more respect if he wasn‚Äôt as ugly and spelled his name as Chris.  I also think Rick Fox was overrated in part because of his looks. That dude had it going on.
"Bro what are you talking about. I counted 12 pushoffs from Booker this game, none of which were called and CP3 wrapping Khris Middleton on certain plays on the perimeter. And yet, these were no calls. Brook Lopez or PJ Tucker, on the other hand, graze Book on the shoulder and it‚Äôs a foul. How much help do you need from the refs in addition to shooting 55% and nearly 70% from 3. Come on man."
"Well allow me to be wrong. And in the spirit of being wrong I‚Äôve decided to be thoroughly and intricately wrong. Let‚Äôs begin.   We start with Kareem and Giannis. We all know Kareem is the career scoring champion but not for long. Lebron will soon dethrone him. And who dethroned Lebron? Why, Giannis of course. By this logic alone Giannis is better but if we get down to the details statistically Giannis is a better player. He provides similar defense and scoring with the added passing and fast break scoring dimension to his game. Also Giannis doesn‚Äôt play against plumbers (except Joe Ingles).   Next we have Worthy and Middleton. Middleton won‚Äôt have a better career than Worthy I‚Äôll give you that. But right now he‚Äôs at his peak and his peak sent a full strength KD and choke job Harden home sans Giannis. One could say KD is a poor mans Khris Middleton. One could say any shot KD can hit Middleton *will* hit. And one will say (that one being me) he‚Äôs the best player in the playoffs. No exceptions. Khris ‚Äòbug-eye/deadeye‚Äô Middleton is better than Giannis and thus is better than Kareem who was better than Worthy.   Any questions? I didn‚Äôt think so.   Finally we have my most controversial (wrong) take. Magic bricked so many jump shots you‚Äôd think the guy had AIDS. He‚Äôs an all time great point god sure. But you know who else is an all time great point god? CP3.  Now I love CP3 but I hope State Farm has an ass insurance policy because Holiday has proceeded to rip CP3s ass off just so he can hand it to him. But that doesn‚Äôt mean Jrue is better than Magic it means he‚Äôs better than CP3. And in all honesty he‚Äôs not. But the edge I give to Magic is erased by Magic‚Äôs tenure as a GM. You can‚Äôt be that bad at building a basketball team and continue to call yourself a basketball player.  In conclusion (aka **tl;dr**) Kareem can‚Äôt pass like Giannis, Middleton is the 2nd best iso scorer in NBA history and Magic Johnson GMd his way out of even qualifying as a basketball player."
"This is r/nba‚Äôs delusion. Marketing is pushing this Finals over others with LeBron &amp; Steph. The average fan wants to watch the guys they know, and pumping all the money into marketing you want isn‚Äôt gonna make Khris Middleton a face of the NBA like Steph‚Äôs  You can enjoy this Finals, but acting as if this is saving the NBA when it‚Äôs had historically low ratings for an NBA Finals (outside of last October‚Äôs bubble Finals) is delusion."
"No shit, Khris Middleton is Jordan"
"Imagine telling someone in 2013 that Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, and Giannis Antetokounmpo would be a Big 3"
Can you talk after that embarrassing khris Middleton flop homie?
ESPN couldn't have been more wrong.  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31766428/nba-finals-2021-experts-predictions-phoenix-suns-milwaukee-bucks-series-mvp  &gt; Jerry Bembry: Suns in 6 | MVP: Chris Paul &gt;  &gt; Nick DePaula: Bucks in 6 | MVP: Khris Middleton &gt;  &gt; Nick Friedell: Bucks in 6 | MVP: Khris Middleton &gt;  &gt; Israel Gutierrez: Bucks in 7 | MVP: Khris Middleton &gt;  &gt; Baxter Holmes: Suns in 6 | MVP: Chris Paul &gt;  &gt; Zach Lowe: Suns in 7 | MVP: Chris Paul &gt;  &gt; Tim MacMahon: Suns in 7 | MVP: Chris Paul &gt;  &gt; Bobby Marks: Suns in 5 | MVP: Devin Booker &gt;  &gt; Dave McMenamin: Suns in 6 | MVP: Devin Booker &gt;  &gt; Monica McNutt: Suns in 7 | MVP: Chris Paul &gt;  &gt; Kevin Pelton: Suns in 7 | MVP: Chris Paul &gt;  &gt; Jorge Sedano: Suns in 7 | MVP: Chris Paul &gt;  &gt; Ramona Shelburne: Suns in 7 | MVP: Devin Booker &gt;  &gt; Andr√© Snellings: Bucks in 7 | MVP: Giannis Antetokounmpo &gt;  &gt; Marc J.

He's like a Lite version of Khris Middleton
Aggie Khris Middleton is clutch
"Here‚Äôs the problem with that sentiment;  Every team, and I mean *every team* wants a Khris Middleton; a lengthy wing that‚Äôs good defensively and a lethal midrange shooter. He was damn near 40/50/90 this year.   So we had to pay him because someone else would have."
Khris Middleton has to be the greatest trade ever for bucks. Not close
"Khris ""Batman"" Middleton. Greek Cheeks can't touch the ball in crunch time because he turns into Ben Simmons at the free throw line in the clutch."
I‚Äôd hate to know what Khris Middleton is then
"Khris ""Batman"" Middleton"
Khris Middleton is a better player than Jimmy Butler. Change my mind.
The Khris Middleton cycle has finally been broken
Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton are the most clutch players of all time
i will no longer tolerate khris middleton slander. dude is cash money with that midrange.
khris fucking middleton man...  what the fuck
WHO NEEDS KD WHEN YOU HAVE KHRIS MIDDLETON?!
"Jrue ""Magic Johnson"" Holiday  Khris ""Michael ""His Airness"" Jordan"" Middleton  Giannis ""Alleyoopbro"" Antetokounmpo"
"Khris ""MJ"" Middleton.  My guy either plays like MJ or Kuzma. There is no inbetween."
Khris been making them all playoffs but bucks late game offense is just fkn dumb. Middleton iso iso iso
"Khris ""Michael Jordan"" Middleton"
Khris Middleton is tuff.
"The Bucks were offering a much better package to the Cavs and yet these guys took the Celtics offer, still pissed about that.  It was basically anyone but Giannis.  Malcolm Brogdon - highly valued at the time.  Khris Middleton - highly valued too.  Thon Maker - highly valued.  Jabari Parker - highly valued.  Picks - highly valued.  These guys really rejected whatever combination of that for what turned out to be Larry Nance, Jordan Clarkson, Rodney Hood &amp; George Hill (top 10 pick too).   Collin Sexton makes it worth but still, why not take the Bucks package."
Zion is dropping 7 more points than Middleton and only taking 1 more shot than him per game. I swear this sub underrates him but the guy dropped 27/7 is his second year in the NBA on a ridiculous .649 TS%. And you know he's only getting better as he is 20. Now imagine how scary Zion would be if he was the second option on the team like Khris Middleton. Middleton has no business being over Zion.
paul george. khris middleton
Khris Middleton will always be all star.. there is no way with giannis/they are not top 3 team in the east
"I'm not saying Giannis is as good of a scorer as KD is in fact the opposite. The nets were putting Blake on Giannis but there was always help at the rim and 2 other players doubled his spin to trap him. As the role players get run off the court over the course of the serie for both teams. The nets realized that they are playing a team with 4 bad three point shooters plus Middleton. In game 7 they were packing the paint and tightly guarding Middleton. And helping of everyone else.    The nets are obviously the better team. I think analyst didn't realize that what make the bucks great is the threat of three that make you not pack the paint. Outside of K Mid guys like Forbes, Portis ,Pat can be heavily exploited by superstars and once you run them off the court the ball stop moving and all you get is Giannis iso and khris iso."
Khris Middleton
"I wanted him on KD because I had just watched him shut down Butler in the first round. I was upset until I read statistics on how bad he was while guarding KD and that's why he wasn't guarding KD. KD was toasting him by either going by when Giannis tried to fight through or pulling up when Giannis went under.  The Bucks threw a rotation of Tucker, Jrue, and Middleton at KD. It was mostly Tucker because he's the strongest and was able to wear KD down a little more, and having Jrue/Khris on others allows them to save a little more energy for offense (same for Giannis). KD was out of his mind that series, though. He hit tough shot after tough shot. I feel like, at that point, if he does manage to beat you by himself, you just have to tip your hat and move on.  I've been a Bud hater in the past. But I have no problem with how he chose to defend KD in that series. People saying he didn't make adjustments are delusional. They tried 4 different primary defenders. They just switching. They tried hedging. Sometimes, it's just a matter of great offense being too tough to stop. The only thing I would've maybe liked to see them try more is aggressively trapping/doubling KD to force the ball out of his hands. But even with Kyrie out, they had too many good shooters on the floor to make that a viable option all the time."
"Without relying on combinations of two all-time-greats;  * Ben Simmons + Chris Paul. This is mostly an excuse to get Chris Paul in a 6'11 body with good rebounding.  * Khris Middleton + Zion Williamson. Shoot from anywhere in defenders faces, Zion's touch at the rim - you'd have to bite on a pump fake, and before you land he's dunked it. Also get Zion with good defense and a bit more height.  * KAT + Steven Adams. There's better options, but it'd just change the rules for what either teams can do with picks; other team doing a pick and roll? Absolutely not. Your team runs a pick and pop? Easiest points you'll ever score."
&gt;Khris Middleton  I was surprised Middleton is ranked 111th. I thought he would be way higher.
Thanasis has more followers than:  Jrue Holiday  Khris Middleton  James Harden  Kawhi Leonard  Rudy Gobert  Who's the GOAT now?
"The idea is that we will always field as competitive of a team as we can, averaging out at around 45 wins, and that in the long run we‚Äôll naturally deviate from the mean +/- 10 wins - becoming a contender or underperforming and narrowly missing the playoffs. It‚Äôs really not a bad strategy for a small market. You can‚Äôt hope to build a warriors-esque dynasty in Indiana. Players will just leave and the payroll bill will come too high.   We‚Äôve had a lot of bad luck. We‚Äôve been legit contenders in 3 distinct eras over the last 30 years. MJ, Shaq / Kobe Lakers, Malice, and the Heatles kept us from winning any titles. Also a firm believer that if Oladipo stayed healthy and stayed at even 90% of his 2017/18 level over the past couple of years, we would have been contenders in the east the last 2 years.   When the strategy has worked and had us in a position to contend 3-4 times over 3 decades, why not keep that strategy when the risks of tanking are so high? Who knows, maybe Duarte turns out to be a Khris Middleton-level player or Sabonis becomes an All-NBA caliber center or Myles wins DPOY. All unlikely, but then again so was Oladipo‚Äôs rapid improvement or drafting a player of PG‚Äôs caliber at pick #10.  Basically a long winded way of saying if it ain‚Äôt broke don‚Äôt fix it. There‚Äôs gonna be some seasons spent in purgatory but that‚Äôs just the cost of doing business in a small market."
"Jrue had some okay games offensively, Khris had 1-2 great games offensively. You know who else had a great game offensively? Jeff fucking Green, like 27 points on 10-13 shooting. Don‚Äôt pretend the Bucks supporting cast were anything close to stellar that series, for a good part of it they were actually pretty terrible, pretty much outside of Middleton‚Äôs 38 pointer and 35 pointer.   And again you‚Äôre just diminishing Giannis‚Äô buckets for no reason. He got to the rim and scored. You do realize that Bud got destroyed for never doubling KD all series long, right?  For the most part we had Tucker‚Äôs 6‚Äô5 ass going one-on-one. Did you even watch?   Again, I‚Äôm NOT claiming Giannis was better that series. All I‚Äôm saying is he was very fucking good, and his supporting cast collapsed outside of Middleton for a couple games.    This is a take that is true by the numbers, is true by the eye test, and is true everywhere but in the minds of people like you who can‚Äôt possibly grasp that two players can be all-time greats in a single series. It‚Äôs sad really."
I'm dying thinking about Stevens nuking the team for picks and Middleton lmao..  Starting lineup:  PG: Dennis Schroder SG: Khris Middleton SF: Aaron Nesmith PF: Enes Kanter C: Robert Williams  Come on that gets MAYBE 10th seed in the East..
Could probably make a better lineup of Chris‚Äôs  CP3 Chris Mullin Khris Middleton Chris Webber  Chris Bosh
"Chris Paul, Kris Dunn, Chris Silva, Khris Middleton, Chris Boucher"
&gt;2 NBA caliber hoopers  So Khris Middleton and Liam Neeson?
"you‚Äôre taking 45 games in a bubble year  plus Murray is 2 years older. he was at 18.6 on 45/34/88 at Sexton‚Äôs age when he was being set-up by the best passer in the NBA    and 3ppg is a big difference. like i said, Brandon Ingram didn‚Äôt do that. Paul George, Russell Westbrook, Jimmy Butler, and Khris Middleton didn‚Äôt do that    Murray had a true outlier year in terms of shooting last year. 45 games of shooting hot is not enough to refute 4 years of league average shooting. last year was the first time Sexton was below league average   and he should have more assists than SextonüòÇ he‚Äôs passing to Jeremy Grant, Michael Porter Jr, and the MVP  Sexton is passing to Andre Drummond, Jarrett Allen, Darius Garland, and Larry Nance.   and you‚Äôre talking about peak, but Murray is 2 years older. watch that Nets game from this year for players at their peak. Sexton‚Äôs entire career is coming up big in big time moments"
Khris Middleton- clutch playoff shooting
Khris Middleton himself?
PG: Kevin Hart   SG: Ted Cruz   SF:  Khris Middleton   PF: Liam Neeson   C:  Vince Vaughn     Only works as a Western Conference team.  Khris carries the team to one win against the Celtics but they clearly lose every other game (Hence why I only put 2 NBA caliber hoopers on the squad)
"There's two lists here because OP is ambiguous. First is a set of people who have never made an all-star team, next is a list of players who weren't all-stars last year.  &amp;nbsp;  **Never Been All-Stars:**  **G:** De'Aaron Fox  **G:** Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  **F:** OG Anunoby  **F:** Tobias Harris  **C:** Deandre Ayton  **Honourable mentions:** Jamal Murray, Ja Morant, Jerami Grant, Clint Capela   &amp;nbsp;  **Best Non-2021 All-Stars**  **G:** Trae Young  **G:** De'Aaron Fox  **F:** Khris Middleton  **F:** Jimmy Butler  **C:** Karl-Anthony Towns  **Honourable Mentions:** Demar DeRozan, Brandon Ingram, Klay Thompson, and everyone mentioned in the list above."
"isaiah thomas, khris middleton, timothe luwawu-cabarrot, marvin bagley, cody zeller  they beat the boston celtics once"
Do the Lakers have someone to stop Khris Middleton from dropping 40?
"The Cavs picked Dion Waiters with the 4th pick and let Dame slide to 6th.  That's a choice where I can at least understand the ""I want to be alive for it"" decision.  Picking Khris Middleton to maybe keep Lebron around is a terrible choice any way you look at it lol."
So then take back picking Dion Waiters at 4th and letting Dame go 6th.  At least that's logical.  Wanting **Khris Middleton** to maybe keep Lebron around for another year is a terrible choice lol.
You would rather see Khris Middleton than have Charles Barkley in your franchise history?
"Your team is literally the reason the Stepien Rule exists and the one decision you want to undo is for Khris Middleton?  Really?  You know your team could have had Charles Barkley, right lol?"
"My take is that the way max contracts work in the NBA indirectly causes tanking. Everyone wants to tank for the next Lebron James because you can afford Lebron for only marginally more than Khris Middleton. Superstars become mandatory because by definition a superstar on a max contract is a steal. How much would Lebron get per year if there was no max contract? 80 million? 100 million?   If you had to pay superstars what they were worth, they would become a lot less important to a championship caliber team. Teams would have to choose between playing Lebron 80 million a year vs two perennial all-stars for 40 million a piece, for example. You'd see stars going to teams for the money, rather than the desirability of the destination, and it would be a lot easier for a team with cap space to snag a player from another team that's cash strapped, as you see in the NFL and MLB. As a result, getting the number one pick wouldn't be nearly as valuable, because there's a good chance you couldn't afford that player once they hit their payday. Instead the route to becoming a contender would be about managing contracts and finding undervalued players, again, similar to the NFL and MLB."

I believe evan fournier is worth 50% of khris middleton so i do not consider this as an overpay.
"r/Celtics, the official Khris Middleton subreddit"
It's so Khris Middleton can have the opportunity to ruin Celtics fans' Christmas
You're forgetting about Khris 'The boston stranger' Middleton
Yeah I think all 4 fanbases would've preferred that.   I don't need Khris Middleton to ruin my Christmas.

Khris Middleton vs Celtics ü™¶
A few years ago a Tobias Harris/Khris Middleton comp was commendable
okay but actually that means the Wizards would have been a superteam if they added a 3rd top player.   Say the Wizards kept Westbrook/Beal and added Khris Middleton somehow who is a top 30 player. Barely top 30 but he is top 30.   that means Westbrook/Beal/Middleton IS a superteam.   Even without any top 10 players they still fit the definition of a superteam. They would probably win like 50 games and lose in round 2 but they are still a superteam
The best #22 on the Bucks before Khris Middleton.  Unrelated but him and Khris seem to actually have a pretty good relationship which is cool
Khris Middleton is too clutch not to be picked
"I've watched Evan his whole Orlando tenure (so like his whole career).  Evan is definitely good enough to be effective in the playoffs, but you don't want the ball in his hands to try and create offense. He needs to be playing off-ball, and going to work off the catch quickly, kind of like how Khris Middleton plays.  He's capable of creating his own shot and running pick and roll and all that, but not really good enough at it to be a consistent source of offense in the playoffs. He doesn't get enough separation, nor is his first step quick enough. If you take him off the ball though, he will be really good.  In Orlando we didn't really have a point guard for a long time and so the ball has pretty much always run through him, because it had to. Even when we had Markelle for the bubble year, the ball still pretty much went through Evan the whole season. He wasn't really getting doubled in those playoff series, it's just when defences tighten up in the playoffs and we are playing two elite defensive teams, it was very hard for him to get clean looks.   P.S. He's also not as bad on defense as people seem to think. He's a lot closer to neutral than a liability."
You acting like Jaylen and Middleton haven‚Äôt had great playoff games themselves. Khris just went bonkers in the Finals and won.   Listen this is just preference. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre crazy to shave Butler higher but it‚Äôs not obvious IMO.   Booker one of the best halfcourt offensive players in the game.
"Jayson Tatum, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Chris Paul, Bradley Beal, Khris Middleton, Jaylen Brown"
Khris Middleton over Paul George is certainly a choice‚Ä¶ I love Khris with all my heart but would trade him for PG in an instant
"Man, if we are cherry picking somebody‚Äôs best performances, you‚Äôre not going to like what I do for Khris Middleton‚Ä¶"
"Before we start just naming players, let‚Äôs think about what kind of skillset we‚Äôre looking for. Since this team is made up of clones, both teams will be switching everything on defense, and there won‚Äôt really be any matchup hunting. Because of this, wouldn‚Äôt expect to see very many ball screens. Instead, I‚Äôd be looking for a versatile, switchable defender with a good handle, a good isolation scoring game, and solid spacing. Passing wouldn‚Äôt need to be elite, but the ability to make basic reads (drive and kick, find the open man, etc.) would be preferred, and obviously better passing is a bonus.   I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs the WORST player (he‚Äôs very good) who would be able to do it but I would be fascinated to watch a team of 5 Scottie Pippens. Obviously the defense and passing are there, and although his career 3pt% is low, his 3pt volume and efficiency were both higher in the mid 90s and I think he could improve on his 3pt shooting if he were to devote as much time and effort to it as players do today.   People in this thread have mentioned Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton, and Paul George, who could all work pretty well I think. As a Spurs fan, I‚Äôm hoping that Keldon Johnson can develop into the kind of player who would be able to do this, but he‚Äôs obviously young and still developing, so we don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôll look like in 5 years. Also, at 6‚Äô5‚Äù, he might just be too small to defend bigger players, even with his famous ‚ÄúBig Body.‚Äù   P.S. Another interesting question is who‚Äôs the BEST player who WOULDN‚ÄôT succeed on a team of clones of himself. I‚Äôd be looking for players who lack defensive versatility (Nikola Jokic, Kyrie Irving, Trae Young) or lack ball handling and isolation scoring ability (Ben Simmons, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert). All of that said, it‚Äôs hard for me to say for sure that these clone teams wouldn‚Äôt still win, given the immense amount of talent present."
"Same can be asked about Khris Middleton. Do you think the Bucks FO would let the media keep pushing this ‚ÄúKhris Middleton is the Robin‚Äù narrative if they believed he was THAT guy? Let‚Äôs not forget Jimmy made it to the Finals a year ago with an injured Heat team that was NOT supposed to be there. It‚Äôs ok to be a Robin, and hell, Middleton is right now one of the BEST Robins, but he‚Äôs still a secondary guy. You can‚Äôt compare a boss to worker working in the system."
Right now Trey Murphy iii. He has really high ball iq. I think in a couple years he could be a khris middleton type
"Khris Middleton had a HUGE year for being remembered, He &amp; Giannis are the core of this Bucks team &amp; it‚Äôs considered home grown, everyone gives him credit for being the closer. He just won a gold medal in the Olympics, will probably be remembered as the Kevin Durant Olympics but he was there lol.  If the Bucks can win another Chip! Khris will definitely be remembered"
"jordan was an absolute midrange sniper, he wouldnt even need to shoot outside shots to still be effective. it has nothing to do with efficiency, some people are driven in ways that dont show up on a stat sheet, and jordan is the quintessential example of that. he would toy with any defender that isnt full package elite. go watch any footage of jordan that isnt a highlight reel and you will see the man was undeniable. his ferocious nature is one that would be unmatched in todays nba, no one has a killer, vindictive attitude like jordan, which is why he would still dominate. plus players like chris paul and khris middleton both demonstrate the value of a midrange in todays game, so while jordan could learn how to shoot threes (if convinced it was necessary), he wouldnt hardly need to because of his midrange prowess. hes also the type of player that when goaded into a 3 where a defender might be sagging off into the paint, he would focus more because he would feel disrespected and need to prove a point to said defender, ie he would take it personally lmao (and make the shit too, consider the shrug game)"
I see a ceiling of Khris Middleton with better defense
LeBron James and Khris Middleton own the Celtics
Dude in the video look like Khris Middleton with Kemba Walker's beard
KD is a poor man's Khris Middleton
Khris Middleton could be
I could see a Khris Middleton ceiling for him
Khris Middleton &gt; Jimmy Butler
Khris Middleton would fit the question about 2 months ago but everybody a bucks fan all of a sudden
"DeRozan, CJ McCollum and Khris Middleton"
Khris Middleton. I think he was chewing gum in the finals.
Khris Middleton is low key Klay Thompson. Bucks repeat.
"Khris ""not a #2 on a championship team"" Middleton!"
Khris Middleton still feels underrated
"I dont see how they can be the second best without porzingis being healthy and they need an alstar calibre wing imo..so jeremi grant?..or khris middleton if you feel a trio of Luka,Grant and KP aint good enough"
Bro üíØ Don‚Äôt forget Khris Middleton = prime Jordan x2 and Curry = Bill Russell
"Because for every underachieving Thon Maker and Jabari Parker, we have an overachieving Giannis and Khris Middleton"
Khris Middleton
"Khris Middleton is a better #1 option than Kyrie Irving, and is comfortably a top 15 player in the league."
Khris Middleton always plays like Danny Ainge insulted his mother
"Khris Middleton.  Despite 2 all-star selections.  Recall a thread where he was called ""not the 2nd best player on any other team"".  Dude then became the 2nd best player on a Championship team.  Apologies to Jrue."
Apparently it's still Khris Middleton somehow
"Look no further than NBA champ Khris Middleton.  Or Australian Michael Jordan, Patty Mills."
"Khris Middleton. yeah dude isn‚Äôt super consistent but really is any player outside of the elite guys? dude is a poor man‚Äôs KD and I mean that with the highest form of respect - he can get off any shot he wants and hits them at a high rate, minus the quickness and length"
"Kawhi would literally be a consistent Khris Middleton who is much better defensively. They could probably have the best guard defender, wing defender and help defender in the league. So I'd take em."
Jalen Green - Bradley Beal/Zach Lavine  Anthony Edwards - Bigger Donovan Mitchell  Cade Cunningham - Khris Middleton/SGA  Ja Morant - John Wall  Jonathon Kuminga - Raw Paul George  Tyrese Haliburton - Malcolm Brogdan
Honestly he was a little more consistent then someone like khris Middleton. Could go off for a big night. Usually in the 23-25 range if I remember correctly (was young but a fan and not looking at stats)
&gt;‚ÄúBucks forward Khris Middleton thought Coach Kidd‚Äôs water park infatuation was a plot to get at single moms.‚Äù  LMFAO
"Cade has a track record of being a way more advanced passer, so if he‚Äôs Khris Middleton with better vision, that‚Äôs an awesome player."
"Is this supposed to be a bad thing  Khris Middleton would go top 4 in a redraft  If teams knew Khris Middleton would go on to be what he was, he‚Äôd be drafted very high.  Helps that Cade is also a better playmaker"
"It would be close, but people are vastly under selling how impactful Kawhi is in the playoffs. He is legitimately one of the best playoff performers in the league, and was shooting like an absurd 60+ percent on mid range shots before he tore his ACL in the Jazz series. He is a Khris Middleton on steroids, who is also much more consistent and can play better defense as well. The Bucks could throw Kawhi on KD or Harden, to try to slow him them down on defense as well. No way the Nets can contain Giannis and Kawhi at the same time. They would get in insane foul trouble, and their skill sets completely benefit one another.   Giannis has never played with a player near Kawhi's caliber before, and they would be completely unstoppable together. Jrue/Kawhi/PJ/Giannis/Lopez, may be the best defense ever assembled as well. At least on paper from a talent standpoint. That would be a ridiculous defense to go against."
And yet if Cade ended up as a Khris Middleton it would still be a disappointment. That's exactly my point. Middleton in good but Cade is hyped up to be a future superstar
"Because it still goes against the cap, and reduces the money available for the other players. Remember, Khris Middleton was paid more than Giannis this year, and Larry Sanders (yes, Larry Sanders) was paid more than Thanasis this year by the Bucks too."
Cade Cunninghams ceiling is Khris Middleton.
"&gt;I just think the 2nd best player on the team deserves blame over a lesser known star. It‚Äôs like warriors fans blaming Barnes for 2016 when donkey got suspended  I think our disconnect is Bledose wasn't suppose to be Harrison Barnes, he was suppose to be Draymond (or Klay, depending on who you thought was better pre KD). Now maybe that was a little to high of expectation, but his expectations going into the playoffs was the 3rd scorer/playmaker, not a role player  The other problem with Bledsoe was his shooting. Lowry was so far away from him that he could either sit in the lane and wait for Giannis or go and double Khris   &gt;I don‚Äôt see how Middleton role changed that much under coach bud.  Under Kidd, he would hold onto the ball for 8 seconds as he backs his defender down in the midrange and get the exact look he wants. He didn't look to pass that much, it was where is my spot and how do I get there. In 2019 he went to an offense where he would wait for the ball to naturally find him and make a play as quick as he can. Under Bud he's turned into a shot creator (not just someone who can hit the open man, but create open looks for teammates) willing off ball scorer and 3 point sniper. The last 2 playoffs it feels like he's been given more freedom to play how he used to, as it seemed he had more iso and midrange this postseason   &gt;Also Bledsoe was seen as a guy that was supposed to be the 3rd option, but who thought he was sane level as Lowry/jrue/Kemba? That‚Äôs crazy.  Maybe he was slightly below them, but he averaged 17, 5 (with 2, 20 point seasons and one season with back to back 40 games) with 45 or higher shooting for 4 years in Phoenix, with other good guards. During the regular seaso for Milwaukee he would put up similar numbers with better defense. Jrue didn't put up similar numbers this year"
"??? Giannis arguably had a better game statistically.   KD scored 8 more points on a whopping 12 more shots. Giannis was much more efficient, rebounded much better (predictable but still worth mentioning), and hit a bunch of clutch shots including the game-tying bucket.   If we‚Äôre bringing up supporting cast, Khris and Jrue played well below their standard offensively. Middleton shot 9/26 and Holiday shot 5/23. It‚Äôs legitimately and argument and this game, while impressive for KD, proved absolutely nothing in a KD/Giannis debate. Giannis really couldn‚Äôt have played much better than he did that game."
"I mean, Khris Middleton isn‚Äôt that peak of that archetype, KD would be. I‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre remotely similar or I expect Cade to be a KD-esque player. But perimeter scoring players don‚Äôt peak at Middleton."
"&gt;Nah role players can always have bad series. It‚Äôs easy to shut them down  You calling him a role player kinda proves my point. He wasn't suppose to be a role player, he was there to be the 3rd guy. The Bledsoe trade was considered a big trade and he was viewed as an eastern conference allstar at first. If he was the 3rd guy, they most likely win   &gt;If khris Middleton played like he did in the 2021 playoffs, y‚Äôall would‚Äôve won for sure. He was terrible in the 2019 series.  I dont disagree with this necessarily, but it was his first year of his role be dramatically changed. He went from an iso midrange scorer to a 3 point, inside playmaker, he didn't look comfortable all season. 2019 was the only year from 2016 (he was hurt 17) to 2021 I thought he shouldn't of been an all star. Bledsoe was also so bad at shooting that it would allow Lowry to stand 10-15 away from him and shadow Khris most of the time"

"The link I posted has the stats. Since you obviously didn't bother (probably because of your Steph colored glasses.) I put what was relevant below. I'll grant this... It basically says that Steph is a below average to poor defender (by every metric) BPM, RPM and FiveThirtyEights DRAYMOND and those adjusted for DRAYMOND. Problem is, in the playoffs he faces above average to excellent guards. Those PGs and SGs hunt matchups with Steph because to them, he's an easy mark.  **From the article...**  &gt;These are some pretty interesting lists. Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There‚Äôs also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic Cases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents‚Äô shooting data than what we‚Äôve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.  &amp;#x200B;  **The Guards....**  Kemba Walker	-0.80	-0.10	+0.70  Isaiah Thomas	-2.62	-1.99	+0.63  Raymond Felton	-0.74	-0.13	+0.61  Jaylen Brown	+0.11	+0.71	+0.6  Klay Thompson	-0.91	-0.34	+0.57  Matthew Dellavedova	-1.16	-0.60	+0.56  Jrue Holiday	+0.72	+1.25	+0.54  Jeremy Lin	-0.41	+0.04	+0.45  Mike Conley	-0.38	+0.06	+0.44  Derrick Rose	-2.11	-1.68	+0.43  JJ Redick	-1.66	-1.25	+0.41  Gerald Green	-1.82	-1.44	+0.38  Eric Gordon	-1.76	-1.41	+0.35  Goran Dragic	-0.92	-0.61	+0.32  James Harden	-0.33	-0.02	+0.31  Bradley Beal	-0.95	-0.64	+0.30  CJ McCollum	-1.18	-0.89	+0.29  Mario Chalmers	+0.25	+0.53	+0.28  Jarrett Jack	-1.23	-0.98	+0.25  Aaron Gordon	+0.27	+0.52	+0.25  Devin Booker	-2.76	-2.51	+0.25  Spencer Dinwiddie	-1.30	-1.07	+0.23  Reggie Bullock	-0.91	-0.69	+0.22  Austin Rivers	-1.70	-1.49	+0.21  Dennis Schroder	-2.10	-1.91	+0.19  Lou Williams	-2.83	-2.64	+0.18  Deron Williams	-0.92	-0.74	+0.17  Tim Hardaway Jr.	-2.23	-2.07	+0.16  Jason Terry	-0.54	-0.42	+0.12  Jordan Clarkson	-2.79	-2.68	+0.11  Wesley Matthews	-0.46	-0.35	+0.11  Donovan Mitchell	+0.26	+0.34	+0.08  ***Stephen Curry	+0.33	+0.39	+0.06***  Khris Middleton	-0.17	-0.11	+0.06  Nick Young	-2.61	-2.56	+0.05  Shaun Livingston	+0.18	+0.21	+0.03  Paul George	+1.30	+1.32	+0.03  Buddy Hield	-1.61	-1.59	+0.02  Jae Crowder	+0.38	+0.39	+0.01  J.J.

In what world is Khris Middleton better than Trae Young?
The problem of what-about-ism is that it quickly dissolves into pointless fantasy scenarios.   What if Khris Middleton had made one extra bucket in that game? Then the KD shoe size question becomes irrelevant.

You know your tiers are ass when you have Khris Middleton and Luka Doncic in the same tier
"Right Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday are superstars, my bad. So why weren't they allstars last season?"
Steph Curry - David Duchovny Khris Middleton - Orlando Jones Kevin Love - Sean William Scott Jae Crowder - Julianne Moore Pop - Ted Levine
Tobias Harris is worse khris Middleton at this point so that‚Äôs worth whatever you think it‚Äôs worth
"He's not nearly as much of a liability as Trae is though. We never got to see a team relentlessly attack Trae because the Hawks never faced a team with an elite pick and roll guard/wing. They didn't have to face James Harden or Kyrie repeatedly hunting Trae and forcing him to defend them 1 on 1. They didn't face even somebody as good as Jimmy Butler, who that's not even his game, but he can do it.   Khris Middleton was probably the best perimeter offensive player they faced in the playoffs and he torched the Hawks and he doesn't even abuse mismatches in the way other elite players do."
revised  PG: Damian Lillard - 36$  SG: Jamal Murray - 7$  SF: Khris Middleton - 30$  PF: Bobby Portis - 3$  C: Embiid - 38$  BENCH  Tristan Thompson - 2$  Andre Iguodala - 2$  Kent Bazemore - 2$  this team is not losing
&gt; Hes a lot closer to a Khris middleton level player than a steph curry.  Curry TS% is 62.64%  Miller TS% is 61.39%  Khris Middleton is 57.19%
Khris Middleton
The game Khris Middleton dropped 38/10/5/5 on 70% to force a Game 7.
"The one game where the Suns did a good job of somewhat limiting Giannis's shot attempts. This was a huge performance because besides Middleton, the Buck's halfcourt offense was bad this game. They needed a monster game from Khris, and he delivered."
Khris ~~‚Äùnot good enough to be the number two on a championship team‚Äù~~ middleton
I think it‚Äôs players just don‚Äôt respect his game as much as someone like even Khris Middleton. Much more skillful player who perfected his craft. Plus you got the cupcake finals and and tons of injuries so players probably didn‚Äôt feel he deserved it as much.
Ja Morant a better basketball player than Khris Middleton?
"They averaged similar stats lol   It doesn‚Äôt matter who we had because everyone sucked offensively that‚Äôs series aside from Giannis and game 6 Middleton, Khris and Jrue shot 29% FG and below 20% from 3 game 7 but everyone wants to act like they were helping Giannis a lot during that season.   To answer your question it would go 4 because then KD would have Harden and Kyrie lol why are you comparing Jrue and Khris to Harden and Kyrie?  It was more than a toe and both feet were on the line when he shot the ball. People want to keep talking about this shot but no mention the fact he went 0-7 in OT   The fact Giannis and KD averaged similar stats and we barely won shows Giannis didn‚Äôt have much help either."
"Giannis should be 1 or 2, I really don't see how anyone could argue otherwise.  In the last 3 years he won 2 MVP's, DPOY, FMVP while averaging 28/13/5 in the playoffs on .593 TS%. During this time, he's lead the league in just about every advanced stat and his best teammate has been Khris Middleton."
"Neither is Jimmy Butler. I‚Äôd take donavan mitchell, trae young, Devin Booker, Khris Middleton, over both of them"
I asked for trade offers around the league for Ben Simmons in the NBA 2K22 franchise mode. Here were the three best offers:     * **Ben Simmons for Khris Middleton**    Don't know what the Bucks are thinking. They just won a championship and now they are trading one of their key pieces. Simmons and Antetokounmpo is some awful spacing.   * **Ben Simmons and Danny Green for Brandon Ingram and Garrett Temple**    Don't know what the Pelicans are thinking. This might be the last straw for Zion. Zion and Simmons is some awful spacing.     * **Ben Simmons and Andre Drummond for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Ty Jerome**    This is totally unrealistic. Presti isn't getting any picks.
"Philly would either know (because they tried to engage in talks and the Warriors said they weren‚Äôt interested) or just not care (because the Warriors didn‚Äôt have anything they want). In either case there‚Äôs no unfair advantage being gained.  Treating this kind of scenario as ‚Äúinsider info‚Äù makes no sense to begin with. If, say, the Kings called up the Bucks and asked what it would take for us to give up Khris Middleton (and according to a lot of GMs, these types of talks around players who ostensibly aren‚Äôt available is very common) and we said ‚ÄúA current All Star-level player and a couple of role players‚Äù, the Kings would then have ‚Äúinsider info‚Äù on what we‚Äôre willing to do for a Middleton trade that most other. They‚Äôre not going to get done for tampering for possessing knowledge that others don‚Äôt just because they thought to ask, nor would we get done for giving them an honest answer."
Khris Middleton in 2020-21 man was like MJ in the playoffs
"Its not just kawhi alone. You need to remember that that whole 2019 team was offensively stacked. Gasol, lowry, kawhi, and green were all 3 point threats. That makes the defense much less willing to help on siakam moves. Vanvleet doesnt have that luxury this season when most of our 3 point shooters kept getting sidelined due to injury or covid protocol. This season was just messed up for us but fred was still consider an all-star snub. Next year is when we can really see the team mold together.   As for AD and DWade, those are 2nd-options for potential dynasty teams. Teams that can look to repeat or win multiple rings. Milwaukee won it this year with Khris Middleton as their 2nd-option. So did the Raptors with Siakam, and so did the Mavericks back in 2011 with Jason Terry (who was their second leading scorer)."
"Kyrie in 2016 was not the player that he was later in his career. Go back and look at rankings heading into that season, and he was ranked lower than Love basically everywhere. And it was 2015 when ppl started calling the Cavs a superteam, and 2015 kyrie was entirely unproven and had never played an NBA game with meaningful stakes.  Khris Middleton today is more highly regarded than 2015 kyrie.   The reason I'm referring to rankings and how they were regarded, rather than actual production, is that the superteam label is very much perception-based"
"I get that Jrue is probably a better player than Cavs Kevin Love but it's weird to me that Khris Middleton is being portrayed here as an equal to Kyrie Irving.  Even aside from that strange comparison, I have never really seen anyone call Khris a top 20 player.  If that's what he is, then great. He's one of my all time favorites. And I hope he can ride that and his playoff success to the Hall of Fame, like Kyrie was so obviously capable of doing by the time he won that championship."
To be fair I like the khris Middleton approach of ‚Äúquietly busting yo ass‚Äù
"You're selling Middleton, Jrue, and even Lopez short. When Giannis was down, his 2-4 options smacked the shit out of the Hawks for two games. Griffin is still okay but come on he has has been a shell of himself from the mid 2010s. Harris is a good shooter but nowhere close to the overall level of talent of Khris and Jrue. Giannis/Holiday/Middleton/Lopez is honestly not any worse than KD/Kyrie/Harris/Griffin"
Oscar Robertson   Ray Allen   Khris Middleton?   Giannis   Kareem
I remember threads on Reddit like 'Who would you pick in a 7-game series: Brad Stevens or LeBron James?' Wild times. Khris Middleton might be the only player who consistently kills the Cs so much that I still love.
"But it's still baffling we didn't beat you even when we have Khris Middleton, who constantly destroys the Celtics."
"Giannis had Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday, both all star caliber level players. Granted no one expected Brook Lopez to turn back the clock"
"Joel Embiid is in the Giannis superstar class. He's a different sort of player, but if you took the gang of useless scrubs Joel has and put them around Giannis, then he also bounces out in the playoffs.  Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday, PJ Tucker, Bobby Portis, Donte diVincenzo and  Pat Connaughton backing up Joel ? And Brook Lopez on the bench for when Joel needs to sit down ? Yeah, I can see them winning a championship."
Khris middleton is like 3x better than Bird. Bird today would be Cedi Osman likely
"Does anyone know what year this was? I see P.J. Tucker out there for the Suns, so I assume early 2010s. If it happened to be the same year, I can't imagine what their heads must've been thinking as that ball rolled around the rim given this one that Khris Middleton had at some point around the same time.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3RiFZa2DcE"
"Recent all-stars I definitely prefer Ben Simmons to:  Kemba Walker, Pascal Siakam, Kyle Lowry, Domantas Sabonis, Khris Middleton, Russell Westbrook, Brandon Ingram, Kyrie Irving, Julius Randle, Nik Vucevic, Mike Conley, D'Angelo Russell"
"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters:  |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/21/2021."
"This is similar to a speech Giannis gave before a loss to Phoenix in game 2 of the finals:  Giannis: ""Bois, literally EVERYONE knows I'm the superior player in the building. Hell, they even know I come from harsher circumstances than the rest of you cowering whiners. None of that is relevant. Imma drop at least 40 no matter what, you try not to play like children and we'll come out on top.""  Then he slapped Khris Middleton across the face and said, ""Lets go win it!"""
"2016 Steph Curry - 30/5/7/2/0 on .669 TS% and not even a top 50 defender.   Giannis 2020 must be better than Steph 2016 then? If only ranking seasons was as easy as laying out statlines and comparing numbers. Your entire concept is flawed.  2019 Giannis wasn't even deserving of the MVP, so let's talk about the 2020 version. An All-Star in Khris Middleton, 2 All-Defense teammates in Brook Lopez and Eric Bledsoe. Weaker Eastern Conference. Giannis got the DPOY too because of a superior record and his team being defense-oriented. The majority wanted AD to get the award instead.  2021 Jokic did not have his best teammate in Jamal Murray for the business end of the season, and even he wasn't an All-Star. Without Jamal and basically any other guards, Nuggets somehow started winning more games. Finished 3rd in a stacked West, leaving behind legit contenders like the Clippers and Lakers.  Apart from all of this, Jokic almost had a 50/40/90 season as a big, which is almost impossible and unheard of. He couldn't miss games because Nuggets would lose every game by double digits otherwise. This should be reason enough to consider his historic MVP season over Giannis'.   Jokic is a shooting big while Giannis is a paint presence, and yet Jokic had a better TS. 2018 Harden is debatable, but both of Giannis' years were not that impressive, atleast not more than Jokic's."
"True, but I‚Äôd include Khris in the borderline star category, but Middleton is a really good player considering he lacks the same athleticism that you usually may see from other players his size."
The Bucks don‚Äôt win the Ring and Bud is fired if Khris Middleton doesn‚Äôt make clutch shot after clutch shot after clutch shot in the entire playoffs run.
"MJ, Shaq, and Bird's teams were better during those periods. Who does Giannis have that compares to Kevin McHale, Kobe, or Pippen?   Please don't say Khris Middleton. I like Khris Middleton, but no."
"Khris Middleton was significantly better than anybody Hakeem had. Vernon Maxwell had 14/4/4 in 1994 and Drexler had 21/7/5. Khris had 25/8/5. If we look at their third best players, Horry (yes, ROBERT HORRY) had 12/6/4 in 1994 and 13/7/4 in 1995. Jrue had 17/6/9. I'm not even going to talk about depth because I know you don't know anyone else on the roster except Kenny Smith and Sam Cassell."
"The past 3 years of Giannis were insane, and yes, probably no other player in recent memory has matched it. However, please never question how good the Bucks were over those years. We‚Äôre talking about Bud having won COTY, the Bucks having a hysterically good starting lineup, and oh yeah, that same guy Khris Middleton playing really good ball. Case and point: his dominant playoff stretch this season"
"Kpj, the starting pg who just averaged 16-6 in his first season and dropped 50-11 on jrue holiday and khris middleton? For ben Simmons? ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£"
"I'll say it slower cause you can't read.  If Khris Middleton was voted in as a guard, Russell Westbrook would not have made the cut.  Ben Simmons still would, because Ben Simmons got the **fifth** most guard votes.  Not sixth.  &gt;No one actually thinks they are anything close to being top 15 in the league.  This entire conversation began by somebody saying Simmons was top 35."
Khris Middleton doesn't ever get any respect.
Lmao stop and be objective for a minute man. When people say he didn‚Äôt have help we mean relative to the competition. Having Kyrie half the series is not the same as having Khris Middleton for the whole series. Blake Griffin is not comparable to Jrue Holiday. Bruce Brown and fucking Jeff Green going off in one of the four games he was healthy enough to play in is not comparable to Brook or PJ lol. They were so desperate they let Harden play absolutely terribly on one leg for 4 games for crying out loud. Like try and be objective for a second. That is not a good supporting cast.
Does Trae stop Khris Middleton from going nuclear in the fourth? I don't think so
"This is the point. He's not. He's certainly the best scorer in the league though. But playmaker, defender, all around player? Nah. He's a taller, skinnier version of Khris Middleton."
"Khris Middleton got some of his numbers as the closer for his team, Mo Williams got numbers but never when it mattered"
"I know it‚Äôs easy to shit on the org, and they definitely made mistakes, but it‚Äôs also really hard to build around a #1 pick that‚Äôs an all-NBA player right out of the gate. The Mavs have the same issue with Luka. You only get these kind of guys when you‚Äôre a deep lottery team, then they come in and instantly boost your team out of the lottery. Then suddenly your picks aren‚Äôt as valuable in trades and if you keep them it‚Äôs hard to find impact players in the 20s.   If you‚Äôre not in a FA destination city, what are you supposed to do to build a contender? All-star caliber 2nd options like Khris Middleton or Klay Thompson or Kyle Lowry aren‚Äôt easily available.  The Mavs have a lot of good role players around Luka, and the Cavs did a decent job of getting role players around LeBron too. The problem is finding a true 2nd option"
"If I see a 23/5/5 I tend to associate it with Khris Middleton, but to be fair every it feels just like the standard very-good-SF line."
"I mean yeah they aren‚Äôt carbon copies, but in terms of pure scoring production and shooting ability, that Mo Williams season is similar to Khris Middleton in 2018-19 when Milwaukee won 60 games"
You can‚Äôt just look at counting stats and estimate both player deliver the same level of production.  Mo Williams could never do what Khris Middleton did to the Hawks.
"While LeBron was amazing, I think Mo Williams had a good year that year . 18/3/4 shooting 44% from 3 on 6 attempts a game? That seems like Khris Middleton level production, solid for a number 2 option. On top of that, they had a top 5 defence that year too. Being top 5 in offence was mainly LeBron, but getting your team defence to top 5 status is a team accomplishment and is what separates a 48 win team from a 66 win team"
"While I don‚Äôt know how it would translate to future games in the series, I was at game 3 and Trae was far and away the best player on the floor until he got hurt. Then I saw Khris Middleton play the greatest quarter of his existence and I felt bad"
"Giannis, Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton and Paul George/Bradley Beal/Donovan Mitchell/Klay Thompson would be favorites there dude. They would have better shooting and defense pretty handily, and could play great zone with Giannis and Brook Lopez to force shots from the nets"
I feel like Khris Middleton might be the Luigi
"Giannis, Jrue, Khris, Mccollum, Brook Lopez with Donte Divencenzo, Bobby Portis and Grayson Allen off the bench  Vs.  KD, Harden, Kyrie, Joe Harris, Patty Mills with Blake Griffin, Bruce Brown and Lemarcus Aldrige off the bench.  Bucks match pure talent and probably win team fit here too. Second option is much worse from Harden to Jrue but Middleton is pretty close to Kyrie because of his defense and how valuable shooting is rn, while the Bucks have a better bench and Mccollum absolutely blows Joe Harris away as a player."
"He‚Äôs basically Khris Middleton on offense with better finishing, slightly better playmaking and mid range shooting but way worse clutch ability. On defense, he‚Äôs one of the worst perimeter defenders in the league, though he was average when he was on the Lakers."
so Khris Middleton is a better 3 level scorer than everyone except KD? really really dumb argument
I'm hoping that Khris Middleton taking him under his wing (pun intended) helps for his development   Also I don't mind the idea of Grayson Allen for what it's worth
- PG: Steph Curry $10 - SG: Jaylen Brown $4 - SF: Khris Middleton $5 - PF:  Giannis Antetokounmpo $10 - C: Myles Turner $1  I'd sacrifice my left nut to see Giannis and Steph play together.
Kyle Lowry $2   Klay Thompson $5   Khris Middleton $5   Anthony Davis $9   Bam Adebayo $6    $27    I use the rest for Hot and spicy from McDonald's
Ben Simmons   Zach LaVine   Khris Middleton   Paul George  Anthony Davis  I wanted to make a team specifically catered towards Ben Simmons strengths. Also this jumbo team is pretty awesome.  PS op you should decrease the 30.
Kyrie Irving   James Harden  Khris Middleton   Jerami Grant  Rudy Gobert
Khris Middleton  &gt; Klay Thompson
"honestly think tobias is a tier above all the other guys.  I wasnt as high as philly fans suggesting he should be an all star or was better than khris middleton.  Still he was in that borderline all star category and in most seasons a good enough 3rd guy for a title team(not next year when kyrie and russ are 3rd guys).  None of the other 4 are, they're all good but really just above average starters in today's league.  Grant had an argument but cooled off the 2nd half of the year."
"Kyrie's reputation as a playoff performer is almost entirely due to the one shot in game 7.  In fact, Kyrie and PG have been two of the least clutch playoff scorers of the past decade.

Now do Khris Khash Money Buckets Middleton.
"I'm not putting him top-15 or anything, just think that for the games he played last year he was better than Middleton.   Also it's not like Khris has a ton of seasons of high level play under his belt either."
&gt;76ers fans would swap him for Khris Middleton in a heartbeat.  Did somebody from the Bucks express any interest in this kind of swap? I'll go start the car and drive Tobias to the airport right now.  Just say the word.
Tobias Harris is the worst value player in the league. Literally anyone who watches the game including 76ers fans would swap him for Khris Middleton in a heartbeat.
Khris Middleton &gt; Klay Thompson and it isn‚Äôt that close
Khris Middleton &gt; Ingram/Michael Jordan too
"Is this really such a nephew take? My favorite comparison is Elgin Baylor VS Khris Middleton. I know the significance of Baylor as an all time great and know about contextualizing different generations, but when I look at the plain footage of their abilities, Middleton is the better player in my opinion. But I guess Baylor will be on this list while Middleton doesn't stand a chance. I think transferring players in newer generation to compare them is more hypothetical thinking then plain comparing of footage, that's why it's such a tough question. There is a good chance that in my top 75 more then half would be current player."
"Fuckers on reddit telling me, always in the gamethreads  ""Khris ain't 'bout this, Khris ain't 'bout that""  My boy a BD on fucking Coach Bud and them  He, he, they say that man don't be putting in no work  Shut the fuck up  Y'all fuckas ain't know shit  All y'all motherfuckers talkin' about  ""Khris ain't even clutch  Khris ain't this...  Khris ain‚Äôt no max player  Khris ain‚Äôt no 2nd option""  Shut the fuck up  Y'all don't live with that man  Y'all know that man the best face up shot maker in the league  Don‚Äôt matter who on him  He shootin' in the hoop over every defender and shit  Man been an allstar since fuckin' I don't know when  Motherfucker, stop fuckin' playin' him like that  Them boys savages out there  If I catch another motherfucker talking sweet about James Khristian Middleton  I'm fucking beatin' they ass  I'm not fucking playin' no more  Y'all know them boys pick and roll with Giannis and them  There‚Äôs a jimmy butler one too."
"People really don't understand shooting variance.     A lot of people think Middleton is super inconsistent for example - but for that to be true, he would have to be a BETTER 3pt shooter than Curry when they both are 'on' (If curry is 'on' more consistently than Khris).  That's just obviously not true.     Shooters have good and bad games - sometimes makes and misses just string together.  There's very strong evidence that 'streaks' are completely based off variance - but if there is one player that weakens my belief in that its curry (when shit is falling you just FEEL like the next one is guaranteed, and it always seems to hit)"
"Jeremi Grant? Khris Middleton, but I can‚Äôt remember if K-Money has been an all star.  Edit: Obligatory Duncan Robinson, though his on ball def is bad, off ball and perimeter I feel is pretty good."
u think Lebron would care hell Khris Middleton would care
Finley - - &gt; Joe Johnson - - &gt; Khris Middleton  Amazing 2nd or 3rd options on championship teams
Khris Middleton with multiple 40 pt games in ECF and Finals. Time people put some respect
"How does that show that Khris Middleton couldn‚Äôt be a 2nd option on a championship level team? I mean yeah I agree if there weren‚Äôt injuries I highly doubt the bucks would be champs but that doesn‚Äôt mean Khris Middleton couldn‚Äôt be a 2nd option on a championship.  team, there have been plenty of worse 2nd options on championship teams (2019, 2014, 2011, 2006, 2005, 2004, 98, etc.)"
"Clutch points in the finals: Khris Middleton: 18 pts on 72% efficiency Everyone else on suns and Bucks 14 pts on 26% efficiency, don‚Äôt forget how unbelievably clutch of a shooter he is, he was so clutch in that run some idiots even called him the best player on the Bucks. He very much seems like the Kobe to Giannis‚Äôs shaq (In no way is Khris Kobe I‚Äôm just just saying he‚Äôs an effective perimeter clutch player to pair with a dominant inside force). Khris was for sure inconsistent but he still is easily good enough to be the 2nd best player on a championship team."
"From being told ‚ÄúKhris Middleton isn‚Äôt good enough to be the second best player on a championship team‚Äù for years, I‚Äôm not gonna say no here"
Khris Middleton wtf.. where is Klay? This sub is most horny for Klay and Giannis content
"The list:  1). Kevin Durant, Brooklyn Nets  2). Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks  3). LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers  4). Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors  5).

Aww I think Khris Middleton isn't good-looking but he has a very kind face and eyes.
According to that Link Khris Middleton only has 2 buzzer beaters.
Iso Joe was so good at just patiently getting to his spots and knocking down shots no matter what the defense was doing. Fitting to see Khris Middleton pretty high on the list as well since he's basically turned himself into Iso Joe 2.0 (at least offensively). Super similar play style IMO.
(5) Khris Middleton - 6
Funny as well that T Ross actually ended up being better than anyone else picked after him in the first round‚Ä¶ but Draymond and Khris Middleton we‚Äôre both picked in the second around that year
&gt;Kobe losing FMVP to Pau or Giannis losing FMVP to Middleton  Comparing a top 20 player of all time to Pau Gasol and Khris Middleton is ludicrous
Khris Middleton transforms into a cross between MJ and Neo when he suits up against the Celtics.
"Boris Diaw was once extremely athletic, he just got very fat. Quite different from Slo-Mo. There's the legendary story of him walking in with his espresso or something into the gym in flip flops, doing a standing dunk, and then walking back out like it was nothing.    Steph still has a unique style despite attempts at imitation and many likely to come as players influenced by him enter the league. Nobody has been to replicate his combination of goat outside shooting, great off-ball movement, extremely solid handles, and incredible finishing skills.    Players have said they all look towards Khris Middleton because of his bag of tricks to get open despite not having elite athleticism."

"HARDDDD disagree  lebron, kd, giannis, kawhi, steph, james harden, jokic, embiid, ad, luka, dame time, paul george, chris paul, jimmy butler rudy gobert, tatum, booker, bam bam, kyrie irving, khris middleton are my personal top 20, with very loose ordering before anyone flames me.  can you really make a case that kat is actually better or has more actual realized impact for the team he plays for than any of those guys? I cannot, I really dont think hes underrated by a long shot. Hes properly rated"
"He's absolutely a star, he just isn't a superstar. He's in that Jaylen Brown/Devin Booker/Rudy Gobert/Khris Middleton/Donovan Mitchell"
Khris Middleton
"Khris Middleton, Past year he could drop 20 in a quarter during the playoffs when hot or little to nothing when cold"
"Because the supporting cast was laughably atrocious.  From the beginning of AD‚Äôs prime in 2014-15 to his last year in NOLA, Pelicans were a +5.05 Net Rating team with Jrue and AD on the court, -7.69 Net Rating with Jrue and AD on the bench.  That‚Äôs a 12.74 points per100 turnaround.  For reference, the Bucks since the beginning of Giannis‚Äô prime in 2016-17 are +8.27 with Giannis and Middleton, and -3.66 without either of them, a similar 11.93 points per100 improvement  So AD+Jrue was just as good as Giannis+Khris, they just played less due to injuries and had a much worse supporting cast.  Btw KD+Westbrook‚Äôs last 5 years together ? +12.02 On/off"
"Context Matters....AD played next to a Top 3 player of all time who damn near averaged a 30 point triple double in the finals, Giannis 2nd option was Khris Middleton who gave you 2 good games a round in the playoffs"
"A) progress isn‚Äôt linear. There are things you and I are better at than our grandparents but there‚Äôs a shit ton they could do we‚Äôd have no clue where to start.  B) there‚Äôs tons in f dudes who can‚Äôt dribble with their off hand. Hell, khris Middleton can barely dribble with either hand but that doesn‚Äôt stop him from being a deadly shooter. Nobody in the league these days can play in the post like they did 20 years ago. Hell, other than distance shooting where has all this extra skill manifested itself? They‚Äôve changed so many rules to make it easier to score. Guys didn‚Äôt all suddenly become so much more skilled, scoring became easier.  It‚Äôs a stupid argument. Jordan, shaq, Robinson, zeke, chuck, magic, Larry legend shiiiiiit the assist record is still held by Scott skiles, nobody handles like white chocolate and cwebb changed the game with his passing. Those are easy because they were stars sure but if you‚Äôre saying average guys now (like say Kyle Kuzma) are better than average guys then because of skill I‚Äôll tell you straight up Chris child‚Äôs would bust his ass harder than he busted Kobe‚Äôs chops. You really telling me Stanley Johnson is more skilled? Cmon now.  It‚Äôs a dumb argument."
"I must've missed the part where Milwaukee traded Khris Middleton. Or the part where the Suns traded Booker or Ayton to bring in Chris Paul. That's what you're suggesting Portland do... Shuffle around deck chairs and play fantasy basketball by trading CJ for a slightly different, maybe better, maybe worse caliber of player.  If there's an opportunity to acquire a player by sending out non-essential salary and picks (Like the DJJ + FRP for Nance trade), then Portland will do it. But they aren't going to change shit up for the sake of change because fans on reddit are bored and got active with the ESPN trade machine.  Did you even watch the Denver series? Clearly you didn't. If you did watch, and if you paid attention to even the most basic of stats, you'd notice that our starters (which are staying the same) won the matchup versus them in every single game. It was the historically bad bench that sunk the team."
"CJ McCollum is super underrated and can be the 2nd best player on a championship team, kinda like Khris Middleton"
"I was told that McCollum  is pretty much equal to Khris Middleton, so if that's true this is a good deal for Philly"
"I cannot find the original source of what I said about McDermott, sadly, but there was one, really. It's not casual that I remember the Number 9.  If you are talking about the last true young core the Lakers had, I guess tit turned out well: Ingram signed a Max Contract and was an All-Star and Lonzo Ball jsut signed a solid contract with the Bulls and is ready for a solid season with a nice team. Josh Hart is a solid rotational player, same for Kuzma.  I get that everyone overhype their talent, but I'm not talking crazy tbh.  For example Dejounte Murray and Jakob Poeltl are top defender in their position as Ball Index says. HERE is a comment where I talk about this. DJ is a Top 4 Defensive Guard and Jakob a Top 3 Defensive Center. About Keldon, he went to the Olympics and brought the energy and played really good during the exhibition games where he played. He also had a 20-20 game this season. Derrick White sadly missed this season, but if you saw the Bubble, he was exceptioanlly good and played even better than DeMar. Also that 36pts game in the Playoffs against Denver two year ago was fire.  **ABOUT DEJOUNTE MURRAY**  Let's bring to the table the mid-range shot then.  Dejounte Murray shot better from the midrange than KAWHI LEONARD while attempting more shots. I highly doubt Kawhi is criticized for his mid-range abilities, instead he's called as someone who never misses from there, considered as one of the best ones in the league. And rightly lemme say because Kawhi is an extremely good mid-range shooter, but have you ever seen someone saying that DJ is at his level.  Actually, only considering the ones that shot more than 210 mid-range shots, DJ is ranked 8th. Better than him, in order, we find: CP3 (382), Jokic (235), Embiid (285), Booker (346), Ingram (354), Beal (333), DeRozan (331). DJ shot an amazing 45.4% with 302 attempts!  Behind him you can find the rightly considered Mid-Range Master Khris Middleton (just 20 more attempts and 0.3% worse). Also Kawhi, Dame, Curry...  (Worth mentioning Nikola Vucevic: less than 1% worse than DJ but with like 70 more shots. Also Irving and KD are excluded because they didn't shoot much because they didn't play much)  And we gotta say that DJ came to the league as a complete terrible shooter, really, he couldn't shoot at all. So he slowly developed one and he is progressing with the range.  Also let's add the fact that he was injuried for a full season and also played his rookie year mainly in the G-League.  Ja Morant played a total of 4127 minutes in the NBA and he's going into his 3rd Season. Dejounte Murray played a total of 5891 minutes in the NBA and he's going into his 5th Season. Their age difference is just 2 years too.  So I'm not saying DJ is the shooting maestro, but he's crazy underrated in everything and especially his shooting abilities!"
what aspect of basketball is devin booker better at than khris middleton? serious question
what aspect of basketball is devin booker better at than khris middleton? serious question
"Honestly I could see him biting at the dumber moments, like against a new kid in the league.  No way he pulls this shirt off it was Khris Middleton for example"
The Pistons 100% wouldn't have been able to develop him but the Khris Middleton trade is an all timer
"That‚Äôs different. Middleton is a better defender than McCollum and can score on the level of McC on better efficiency. Middleton also had the best big man in basketball on his team for that title run. AND he was saved by Durants foot on the line. Fwiw, Khris and Embiid probably doesn‚Äôt win a ‚Äòship either."
"Tractor Traylor for Dirk Nowitzki 1998 draft day deal.   Bucks traded Brandon Jennings to the Pistons for Brandon Knight and some guy named Khris Middleton.   The Sixers traded away Andrew Iguodola and Nik Vucevic for  Andrew Bynum.and Jason Richardson, neither of whom really ever did anything more."
"I think a lot of people forget how the Bucks got Khris Middleton.  Bucks got: Brandon Knight, Khris Middleton, some dude named Viacheslav Kravtsov.  Pistons got: Brandon Jennings.   The main trade was Knight for Jennings which really didn't work out for either team. Pistons put Middleton in has a throw-in and he turned into an All-Star making clutch buckets for the Bucks in their championship run."
"Deng was Khris  Middleton before Khris Middleton in his prime. This sub thinks of his Lakers contract. But in that 09 series against Boston, everybody knows the Celtics were missing KG, nobody talks about the Bulls missing Deng."
Pistons trading Khris Middleton &amp; Brandon Knight for Brandon Jennings. Smfh
"2 way players need to be prioritized over scoring gods. If you aren't also playmaking for others, scoring doesn't impress me - most dudes in the NBA think they can score. Locking up on defense, or keeping a known flamethrower under 30 pts is more valuable than league minimum and a bunch of criticism about how they can't play basketball. This is fully why I believe the big has been devalued today - literally most of the MVP candidates last year were 7 footers, an athletic big has been a top 2 pick as long as I can remember, and the two teams in the finals last year punished the paint.   Equally unpopular is the idea that mid range scoring is dead, when you can't really name a top scorer who isn't deadly from midrange. KD, Kawhi, Chris Paul, Khris Middleton, Devin Booker, and so many more LIVE in the mid range. It's literally like 75 percent of all usable offensive floor space. Curry can do a LOT more than shoot threes, I think he's got most kids mind warped about what good basketball is."
Khris Middleton would get more calls and therefore be a top 20 player if he was better looking.
"&gt; AD did not play better than Giannis in the playoffs lmfao  Of course he did. He laps him in every advanced stat, especially impact stats. Based on actual impact, Giannis had a top-50 playoff run ever. AD had a top-10 playoff run ever. You guys just don't understand the value of a dude who does everything on defense, and gives you 28 points per game on Dirk-like efficiency **WITHOUT NEEDING THE BALL** on the other end.  &gt; having Prime LeBron on your team is not less help than Khris  Middleton is not the only player on the team. Middleton, Jrue and Brook are all miles better than anyone AD had on the 2020 Lakers outside of LeBron.  &gt; the only reason he's an all star is because he plays with giannis  Ya got any other dumb takes ? Bucks won 2 **CONFERENCE FINALS GAMES** without Giannis for god's sake. What more evidence do you need ? Look up Middleton, Jrue and Brook's stats in those games. They all played like All-NBA guys. Middleton isn't an All-Star because of Giannis, if anything he's an All-Star in spite of him. Giannis is ball dominant and doesn't allow his co-stars to shine the way AD does."
Tied for the league lead with Khris Middleton
"case in point - Giannis and Khris Middleton. Used to fight for minutes, both improved each other"
I‚Äôd rather have Khris Middleton with Lebron over AD.
"I remember being absolutely LIVID we didn't draft Quincy Miller in 2012. I thought he might be a lite version of Durant, like what MPJ is now. Turns out I should've been madder about missing on Draymond Green or Khris Middleton for Jeff Taylor. Turns out Quincy Miller wasn't even the best Quincy picked in the late 30s of that draft..."
Who out of these 30 are you taking Gobert over? Serious question  Kevin Durant  Giannis Antetokounmpo  LeBron James  Stephen Curry  Kawhi Leonard  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Joel Embiid  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Damian Lillard  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Bradley Beal  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Kyrie Irving  Trae Young  Zion Williamson  Donovan Mitchell  Khris Middleton  Karl-Anthony Towns  Bam Adebayo  Jaylen Brown  Jrue Holiday  Zach LaVine  Deandre Ayton   Ja Morant  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander
"&gt; ""Oh yeah, [their relationship], it's grown a lot,"" Antetokounmpo said on Zoom after the first preseason game. ""They sit next to each other in the locker room now. Yeah, they go out to dinners. Dates and stuff.""  &gt;‚ÄùHey, you sound jealous, man. You all right?"" Middleton, who was waiting to join the call next, inquired from the background.  Locker room tensions boil over as Khris and Jrue cut Giannis out of date night."
"I was at the game. Feeling the crowd get silent as we watched the tape was great.  Goga kept his arm down on Middleton and Middleton pushed him off.  Goga then tried to pin Khris again with the same arm. Middleton yelled at him and Hill came in and pushed like a bad mfer.  Don't know why Middleton kinda jumped weird into the pile, and I think the crowd thought it was a bitch move (Middleton does seem to flop into weird situations, still my favorite player).  Pacers are a cool default team to live around. I like the team a lot."
"The shooting ones Khris Middleton will probably break, but everything else Giannis is shockingly close to taking already. We are so blessed rn"
khris middleton after a slip n slide
"On a scale of 1-Khris Middleton, how sweaty we talking?"
Khris ‚Äúgoogle me‚Äù Middleton
Khris Middleton
khris middleton is i think about 40ish 3s made away from being Milwaukees alltime leader in 3 pointers made
"‚ÄúBroken sixers‚Äù lmao way to discredit their entire team cuz simmons didnt dunk. Simmons still has elite d and they have thybulle. And did you forget there was a Bucks series in which they have khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday? Im not aware we only went against the Knicks! Forgot about 2 other series with elite defensive teams. Oh shit wait thats Ja, only one playoff series in a gentleman‚Äôs sweep.    Lemme discredit the jazz by saying rudy go ert a scrub he broken"
John the Baptist for John Collins has to be my favorite.   Bucks have some good ones though. Donte with the Big Ragu or Maple Jordan. Khris with Kash Middleton. Brook as Splash Mountain.
"Exactly. At one point Otto Porter Jr (got a max RFA offer sheet) was being paid a higher salary than John Wall and Bradley Beal while on the same team. But somehow the ""others"" are being screwed over in this system... lol  Giannis is only making about $5-10mil more per year than Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday. He is drastically underpaid bc his salary is capped by the CBA"
he can be a better Khris Middleton imo
"Being the number 2 on a title team is a buzz kill?   Idk man, if you tell a GM or fan that you have a choice of 3-4 players, but you were told Cade was the only one with a floor of Khris Middleton, everyone is drafting him.  Khris Middleton is really good, and if he was a number 1 overall pick, no one would be calling him a bust at all.   Wiggins had superstar potential, but couldn‚Äôt put it together. So yeah, I‚Äôd definitely take a player if their floor was Khris Middleton no matter what pick I had."
Having a floor of Khris Middleton makes a player pretty damn good.
"Tbf, after all the hype, Cade turning into Khris Middleton instead of a franchise-anchoring playmaker would be a bit of a buzzkill. Not saying that's anywhere close to his ceiling, but you gotta take all percentile outcomes into consideration."
"Move Klay to the three then and take out Wiggins. At this point klay will have lost a lot of mobility and his best bet will be moving to the 3 much like Khris Middleton after his hamstring injury.   I don‚Äôt exactly know what the future for 20 year old James wiseman holds. I think he has the physical tools and the potential to become an all star one day. The thing is if he ever does reach that potential or start to reach that potential it will most likely be in a few years. A few years where curry will be fast approaching 40 and green and Thompson will be in their mid 30s. I.e when the warriors window is pretty much shut.   Instead of wiseman, who‚Äôs absolutely a net negative right now you could have Lamelo who‚Äôs not only bursting at the seams with potential, but who is also producing at or close to an all star caliber level."
"Reread the comment again. The guy you replied to said that given that Middleton is 30 (at the middle/end of his prime), it's good that the Bucks have a younger Khris aka Nwora according to Jrue."
Khris middleton and I‚Äôm not biased whatsoever. His turnaround jumper is so smooth
"Realistically, no.   But, in theory, yes.  This line-up, if it was ever assembled, would win a ring IMO:   PG: Damian Lillard  SG: Norman Powell  SF: Khris Middleton  PF: Julius Randle  C: Bam Adebayo"
I‚Äôd like to point out that Khris Middleton has played more playoff games than Lillard in his career
Underrated as far as smoothness but Khris Middleton
Will be All-NBA Khris Middleton this year

"To be fair some of that is that our biggest player on the floor if Giannis isn't there right now is Khris Middleton. Spurs played it right and went to the rim, because if the guy in charge of protecting it is 6'7 or 6'5, the roster can easily make those."
Khris Middleton better be an all-star this year
we won a game running a lineup with Khris Middleton at center
Can‚Äôt stand khris Middleton
He also had Khris Middleton and Brooke Lopez and other good players around him
"I honestly don't understand this idea that Klay is some kind of historical superstar.   Khris Middleton, last four seasons: 20/5.8/4.5/1.3 stocks on 47/39/88 (and even better the last two seasons) and a better defender than Klay.  Klay, 5 year peak: 21/3.7/2.4/1.3 stocks on 47/42/86  Why is Klay an all-timer, but Middleton is nowhere near the list?"
"Which is why he is the most plug and play player ever. because his ideal skillset is inherently complimentary. Slot him in next to Giannis and Middleton, Kawhi and George, Durant and Harden, and he would stay a top defensive player and a 20+ ppg scorer. no drop-off. Hell, he'd probably become the second option over Middleton, but I won't argue that one too hard, Khris is a badass and deserves full respect.  Klay by nature is a multiplicative talent, whereas most 20+ ppg scorers are additive. People like to talk about the importance of playmaking, but that can have diminishing returns next to other talent if it's too tied in with your scoring capabilities."
"Khris Middleton? Awesome player, deserves his due,, nowhere near Klay in accomplishments, stats, eye-test, or professional recognition.  Hope you get the professional help you deserve, bro, cause a statement like this is a cry for help."
"Khris Middleton is honestly a better player and no one would dare mention him being on a top 75 list.   Klays whole legacy is propped up by Curry, Durant top 10 players of all time and peak Draymond. He was the 4th most important player on most of their title runs."

"You‚Äôre acting like Jrue holiday and Khris Middleton are role players and aren‚Äôt stars. Your point basically proves moreys point. And yes we don‚Äôt need another super star but we need another star pg who can distribute and shit create. What role players do we need? We are stacked on role players. We have a very solid bench. Korkmaz, Isaiah Joe, Andre Drummond, Niang, Thybulle. Thybulle and Drummond provide good defense. Drummond provides good rebounding. They are all solid at defending. Korkmaz brings the shot creation and ball distribution, Joe and Niang are very good catch and shoot players. And then in our starting lineup we have three very solid role players, Curry, Danny Green, Tyrese Maxey. So which role players do you propose that make us into a title contender huh? 1-2 solid role players and we are just pushing out players like Joe and Maxey who are developing very nicely. The fact is we need another 20+ ppg player who can be relied upon on the perimeter in the fourth"
Would that also not make Khris Middleton and Pascal Siakam superstars?
Khristopher Khris Middleton
"Your flair is Khris Middleton, bipolar shooting is his middle name"
"Do it in the playoffs, then talk. [Until then...](https://www.mykhel.com/img/2021/10/jrue-holiday-21-khris-middleton-22-and-giannis-antetokounmpo-34_xsmpvvvivhjf1tpiz7v8avwkw.png)"
"Well the definition of superstar has been watered down lately, so im not sure what your definition is. mine has always been an arguable top 5 player, so i would say Dame, PG, or Klay would be my choices. Khris middleton would be my pick if you think those 3 guys are superstars."
"No Ben Simmons trade will make them a ‚Äúchampionship contender‚Äù the only true path for the Sixers is if Harris becomes a Khris Middleton type player.   I don‚Äôt even know what your point it, if Morey can make the team better he should."
"Means Giannis at center, which means he can't guard Jimmy, and then Middleton has to be on Jimmy makes means he can't guard Robinson. Milwaukee loses all his defensive advantages for that game.  Giannis and Khris are awesome and they can still win, but pretty meaningless game if you want to learn anything about that match up"
"If you believe that KD is only marginally better in offense than Giannis. Imagine this, put them both in a team with no scorer, which one would shine more? KD is offense. Full stop. Giannis is stoppable. You‚Äôre taking away how the Bucks is enabling Giannis to be better, you‚Äôre going to pull out statistics of Jrue and Khris Middleton and how they have lower TS and not contributing to the offense, it‚Äôs simply because of those 2 that can generate their offense enables Giannis to be who he is. You can double or triple team KD, he will still get his because he‚Äôs that efficient in offense. Defense wise, it is also how bucks enables Giannis to be great defensively, DPOY level. KD has proved to be above average or excellent help defender in that Warriors team, who does he have in Nets to enable him to do that? Blake Griffin? You‚Äôre taking away way too much from KD to just point out KD is only ‚Äúmarginally‚Äù better, when it is quite significant that KD is better. KD did play more, and I believe Giannis is not at his peak yet, but as of now, yes KD is better. In 2 years? I‚Äôll have my money on Giannis. Even if you say KD has Harden, he has a corpse of Harden in the playoff against Bucks."
Celtics: Khris Middleton
Not just the West! Plays dirty as heck. Bad memories of two-handed shoving Giannis mid-air and tripping Khris Middleton for me.
What about Khris Middleton when he‚Äôs playing the Celtics?
"&gt; Did he really ball out though for max level contract?  Other than a few exceptions, like Kobe's last contract, a new contract is for future performance, not past performance.   The Bucks paid Khris Middleton at a time when many people thought he hadn't earned it yet. Here's the r/nba thread where everyone calls him overpaid:   https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/c7k7nl/wojnarowski_free_agent_khris_middleton_has_agreed/  Is he overpaid now? The Bucks didn't pay that contract for 2018 Middleton, they paid it for 2021 Middleton."
"&gt; He‚Äôs worth a max from a ‚Äúwe want to keep this guy around and happy and hope he reaches his potential‚Äù point of view  If you want to compete for titles, gambling on that kind of future development is something you're gonna have to do (or hope Lebron just picks your team in free agency).   Here's a thread from 2 years ago, when MIL re-signed Khris Middleton. Everyone in the thread says MIL overpaid, and that Middleton hadn't earned that big of a contract, that he chokes in the playoffs, etc.   https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/c7k7nl/wojnarowski_free_agent_khris_middleton_has_agreed/  Ask Bucks fans right now if they think he's overpaid."
The suns aren‚Äôt reliant on ayton to be a title contender. Khris Middleton turned out to be a complete baller who can create his shot crunch time in the playoffs. I don‚Äôt think ayton turns into that.
"&gt; Harden and Ayton are not comparable players imo. Ayton is several tiers below.   While Harden &gt;&gt;&gt; Ayton for sure, the situations are also different in that PHX is completely reliant on Ayton to be a title contender. As great as Harden is, OKC was still a contender without him.   So if anything, Ayton is more important to PHX than Harden was to OKC. But that's assuming winning a title is Sarver's actual goal, and not just ""getting a good bargain.""   Sometimes chasing a title means you don't only give out ""bargain"" contracts. Khris Middleton was widely considered an overpay when he signed his contract  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/c7k7nl/wojnarowski_free_agent_khris_middleton_has_agreed/  but I doubt the Bucks care too much right now."
"Lmao that statline against the Celtics is absurd. Who does he think he is, Khris Middleton?"
"Idk man Khris Middleton did it too. KD just lost a step to the Achilles, he‚Äôs still KD and he‚Äôs getting his buckets but at least to me it‚Äôs been obvious for awhile some of the athleticism is gone for good"
"Well, he makes a serious impact against everyone except Milwaukee (because of Giannis).   Last night, he primarily defended Khris Middleton, which isn‚Äôt new. He defends wings well. His impact was negated by Brook Lopez playing the drop game magnificently, and by Milwaukee being a meh matchup for him defensively"
"To put that into perspective, Khris Middleton is only a 2 time all-star. Simmons is absolutely an elite player, he's just currently acting like a baby and hot takes about his talent are coming out the woodwork."
"dont worry, there isnt a single bucks fan that doesnt love khris middleton"
"He was limited in play making because bucks locked everyone else down. I argue the bucks would been just as successful with Middleton on Durant and doing the exact same defense on everyone else. Middleton probably would have done a better job guarding Durant too. Now, PJ was def needed because Pat was basically the only playable bench player for bucks vs nets last year with Donte out. But this year, I‚Äôm sure Bucks are hoping they have more playable depth with Grayson/Donte, Semi, and George Hill. If Nwora is for real, that‚Äôs a nice bonus. It does appear bucks plan on using Khris on Durant, at least while Semi is out."
"I think you need multiple years of praise from the armchair GMs to get Masai status. Last year this time this sub was crucifying the bucks for failing to make a cp3 trade, and failing to keep brogdon. Also, the armchair gms would have kept tucker this offseason and magically got khris Middleton to accept a deal for $5M less.    To give credit where credit is due, the bucks could have had jrue and Bogdan when some folks wanted cp3 and a small group was content with Bledsoe.    Masai turned bargnani into picks and derozen into kawhi. That gets you praise the second it happens"
Khris Middleton is a 2-time all star and Jrue Holiday is a first team all-defense player. Like yeah keep reinforcing my point
"Nah, Nwora's a SF/PF.  Khris Middleton might be in trouble."
I love Khris Middleton and I don't care who knows
i hate when the camera pans to khris middleton
Khris Middleton with his jumper on is a damn beauty to watch
Khris Middleton is a silky motherfucker

SOMEONE GET KHRIS MIDDLETON AN NFL CONTRACT
*and Khris Middleton
Who's trying to listen to Khris Middleton speak
"Ah yes, unanimous MVP Khris Middleton"
"Greek Freak definitely had superstar help in Khris Middleton and the bucks are a very solid team all around but I agree he deserves to be recognized as best in the world. Narrative that 37 year old lebron is still the best has to stop, only argument to be made is KD because he‚Äôs still the best scorer and an elite player overall"
Imagine if Khris Middleton did this when Giannis was out/not playing well.   I‚Äôm so confused why everyone is so hype to defend Ben he has been playing like hot ass for years in the playoffs
no bucks have to add in khris middleton and jrue holiday to get the goat tht. Alas sacrifices
"&gt; bums like Khris Middleton and Kyle Lowry, who could never play an important role in winning championship  They have both played important roles in winning championships in the last 3 years..."
"Right, I think we are playing for either 2 situations here. One where garland starts at point guard, sexton is at the 2, okoro at the 3, Lauri at the 4, and Mobley at the 5. Mobley at the 4 and Allen at the 5 works too, that being said either Allen or Lauri will get bought out, and love is probably a bench guy at this point. This would also require sexton to be better for the flow of the offense. The second situation has garland at the point, okoro at the 2, a bigger wing that is similar to Khris Middleton(acquired in a sexton trade) at the 3, mobley at the 4, and Allen at the 5. Here, the team flows through Evan mobley."
"I think you‚Äôre spot on. Lou Will seems like a realistic best-case scenario for Herro, whereas a maxed-out Huerter feels more like Khris Middleton type (maybe?).   Both good players, just very different roles on very different teams."
Bingo. Just ask the Milwaukee Bucks on what to do.  They were almost ridiculed for giving Khris Middleton a max contract. NBA fans called it an ‚Äúoverpay.‚Äù  I think I can safely say the Bucks are pretty happy with how it all turned out. The contract was a no-brainer.
Is it just me or is Khris Middleton a dozen spots too high at 16?
"You have to carry Willie Cauley-Stein and Ky Bowman to deserve the max in the NBA. This is a common fact that most people agree on, and I'm amazed teams are giving maxes to bums like Khris Middleton and Kyle Lowry, who could never play an important role in winning championships"
"He could win a chip as a first option but it would take incredible amount of luck to do so, just as devin booker and the suns had this year. Even then you could argue chris paul was the first option that playoff run because of his leadership and facilitating. Dame‚Äôs playstyle just fits better as a second option. Someone who is clutch and can take over when the first option cant hit any shots (like khris middleton but alot better)"
Khris Middleton takes a lot of midranges

"No offense dude but it's clear you didn't watch young LeBron if you're talking about having more success. That dude carried a team with one of Larry Hughes, Drew Gooden, Boobie Gibson, or Big Z as his second best player to an NBA finals appearance at age 22. Giannis has played with Khris Middleton his whole career and couldn't make it to the ECF until they added Jrue Holiday and won a ring during a wacky covid/injury-ridden season. Giannis is absolutely exceptional, don't get me wrong, but LeBron was just different."
Khris or Giannis? Prime Middleton taking the 2022 MVP would be hilarious af
Khris Middleton MVP
I mean I love Khris Middleton as a player but only when he is playing forward and I can definitely tell when that is.
"That's why there's so many posts about Donovan Mitchell, Khris Middleton, Devin Booker and Jimmy Butler eh"
Khris Middleton also got snubbed from all NBA one year because he had too many split votes for guard and forward
Khris middleton üòë
Khris Middleton
"$228M for 5 years = ""I'm broke""   Now we know how [Jrue ""Big Money"" Holiday and Khris ""Khash Money"" Middleton](https://youtube.com/watch?v=78Xe5BlsEFk#t=3m14s) felt now."
We need Harden to actually play like an MVP though  Right now he's playing around the same level as last season's version of Khris Middleton(much better playmaking but much worse defense) and given we don't have a Jrue Holiday that could be a big problem against a team like the Bucks  It says a lot that in the thread about who should be the other All NBA 1st team guard alongside Steph his name didn't get mentioned until like 4 or 5 names down the list
Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday
"Without question. Changing 1 or 2 draft misses to the best player available can take literally any team from bad to great. Just using the Timberwolves as a coincidental hypothetical here because they traded for the pick before he was drafted - imagine if the Wolves take Giannis instead of Shabazz Muhammad back in 2013. Assuming everything else plays out as it did in terms of draft moves and assuming Giannis's development isn't affected one way or the other, you would have had a team of Giannis, Jimmy Butler, KAT, and others I'm not thinking of presently. I don't know that ends up as a Championship team solely because of the existence of Golden State, but at the very least, that makes you very firmly in the top level of contender that season. Can also say that for literally any team in 2014 with Jokic being available deep into the second, or 2012 with both Khris Middleton and Draymond Green being available in the second round. Taking just those three and putting them on literally any team makes them a mid-level playoff team at the absolute minimum, even if the team outside of them is doodoo.  The what-if game is a little less dramatic in some other sports, but basketball is so disproportionately affected by the top level players that making even one or two changes with those guys drastically changes the makeup of the league."
- Kawhi  - Giannis  - Pascal Siakam  - Marc Gasol  - Jrue Holiday  - Fred VanVleet  - Khris Middleton  - Kyle Lowry  - Serge Ibaka

Let's not disrespect ~~Furkan korkmaz~~ Khris Middleton
"It's different with Curry though. This isn't Khris Middleton going off for 33, it's the best shooter of all time, one with a historic rivalry with the home team and probably a top 10 player all time when all's said and done. This is like Jordan or Duncan getting applause from the home team."
his shot selection leads to this lol it‚Äôs kinda like khris middleton
"He‚Äôs no Khris Middleton, I‚Äôll tell you that"
"Khris Middleton once tore his hamstring completely off the bone, requiring surgery to reattach and fix it.  He started playing in games again less than six months later.  In about two weeks, we're going to come up to the 6 month mark since the day Harden suffered his (much less serious) hamstring injury, and you're still going to be using it as an excuse every time Harden has a shitty game.  Lol.  Keep that tantrum going, babe."
Remember the trade Khris Middleton for CJ  McCollum? xD
"Well then I don‚Äôt know what the fuck your point is since stars still take a ton of midrange shots. Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, CP3, Devin Booker, Khris Middleton, Kyrie Irving, etc. all take a shit ton of midrange shots. Even stars who aren‚Äôt good at them like LeBron, Jayson Tatum, or Anthony Davis shoot them all the time.  Most of the change we‚Äôve seen is role players shooting threes instead of spotting up for abysmal long twos that they should never take except if they‚Äôre at risk of a shot clock violation."

Like Khris Middleton obviously
how about john wall + tobias harris + khris middleton?
"Lmao and everyone's team who was saying that also lost to the Suns SMDH.  The Bucks were legit and have a 2 time MVP who is top 3 in the league. Khris Middleton and Jrue stepped the fuck up when it mattered. I'm disappointed we dropped 4 straight to y'all, but the 50pt last game by the Greek Freak was a sight to behold. Bravo Bucks. Bravo üëè  Maybe we'll catch you there again sometime."
I think he'll end up being a more consistent Khris Middleton with  better passing ability. Which is still a really good player.
"Hes ‚Äúon track‚Äù but that‚Äôs assuming everything falls into place for the rest of his career, which is unlikely. He‚Äôs got 7-8 more years of his prime left to win some more rings, but a Khris Middleton ACL tear, Jrue Holiday decline, or a lack of development from anyone else can rule him out from winning a title for the next few years. Ontop of that, we saw what happened with the Warriors, and any dynasty team can emerge out of nowhere. The league changes fast and it‚Äôs naive to guarantee the Bucks winning a couple more titles.   He needs more MVP‚Äôs, and it‚Äôs really easy for that to not happen. If Lebron doesn‚Äôt win MVP this year, he‚Äôs gone 9 seasons without winning one. It‚Äôs easy to argue he was so dominant in that 9 year stretch that he should‚Äôve won at least 2 MVP awards, but looking year by year, that argument becomes near impossible.   Basically, he has one of the best resumes at 26 that we‚Äôve ever seen, but that‚Äôs far from being on track for GOAT, so many things can happen, and so many things need to fall into place."
"If you‚Äôre talking strictly shooting then Khris Middleton‚Äôs career percentage is 39% (in both Reg Season and Playoffs), to Birds 37% regular season and 32% in the playoffs  That being said I would not have Middleton in my all time starting 5 haha just answering your question"
KHRIS Middleton?
Khris Middleton hit a half court shot slightly after the halftime buzzer too
"Giannis faced kevin durant on Opening Night and beat him in that game. I know it is a regular season game but Kevin Durant has an MVP player in James harden while giannis has khris Middleton. In my opinion, Giannis is better because if you look at his teammates none of them are in the top 10 player list in the NBA both lebron and kd has anthony davis and james harden. Im not trying to disrespect khris Middleton but the man is inconsistent imagine if giannis had a top 10 player that fits his playing style that is consistent like jayson tatum who is close to being top 10 nobody in the east or NBA is beating the bucks. Giannis can carry a team better kevin durant needs MVP and all star caliber players on his team to succeed"
Forgot to mention he's better than Khris Middleton
That's what they said about Khris Middleton.

"I don't get what you're refuting here. They played with those guards. They still carried and led the team. Guards are ball-dominant by nature. Every team needs a guard to bring the ball up and pass the ball and facilitate the offense. I listed examples of players who were not ball dominant but still carried their teams.  In fact the fact that there are other ball dominant guards on those teams who might be all star caliber players but STILL weren't the team leaders or offensive team leaders is the very essence of my rebuttal.  Maybe I'm not conveying this properly, and maybe it's my poor semantics. My point is this:  - Karl Malone played next to John Stockton. Karl Malone ""led the team"". He won the MVPs, not John Stockton.  - Giannis played next to Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, whatever. He won the MVPs and FMVPs, not Jrue or Khris. He ""led the team"".  - Shaq played next to Kobe, one of the most ball-dominant guards of all time (albeit in in the triangle). Shaq won the FMVPs, not Kobe. Shaq ""led the team"".  - KD played with Russell Westbrook, another ball-dominant guard. KD led the team.  The excuse that AD isn't in a position to ""lead a team"" solely due to his role in the offense in that he doesn't bring the ball up the court, handle the ball, playmake for others, is bullshit. Because of those examples.  You said here ""Luka, Trae Young, Dame"" are in the position to do so, and so they unfairly get more credit. This makes no sense. Because of those examples. AD should be good enough and has played alongside enough talent to be able to lead a team and carry a team to playoff contention."

"Damn, just below Khris Middleton numbers"
Khris middleton
That's a lot of ifs. I didn't even mention Jaylen Brown/Khris Middleton. Cole Anthony was just a random east guard that I mentioned that has comparable if not better stats. I could've replaced his name with FVV.
"Jaylen Brown will be an All-Star, as will Gobert and Mitchell. Paul George right now is an all star starter over either laker. Draymond's not an allstar, neither is Valanciunas. Khris middleton will be an all-star. Jarrett Allen will not be an all-star.   &amp;#x200B;  Brogdon, randle KP, wiggins, are not deserving of all-star consideration."
"CJ hasn't become a consistently efficient scorer in the way khris has. He's had only one year with above average efficiency I think. He's streaky like Middleton but not on the good end of that streak often enough. That being said scoring is good best skill.   Khris's AST% has gone up every year. CJ's goes up, goes down. I do think he's a better playmaker than he was a few years ago but I think khris has improved more.  Also a Khris for CJ swap is ludicrous given the huge defense gap between them."
Khris Middleton is closer to Jabari Parker than Paul Pierce is to Middleton
I feel like Khris Middleton only because Kawhi‚Äôs quicker and more athletic.
Jokic is the obvious answer. Khris Middleton if you count him as a star. Guy might be the most talented scorer for someone with as slow of a first step as him.
"This is extremely disastrous. Bobby Portis, Grayson Allen, Khris Middleton - all our best shooters - have 1 FGA attempt this quarter. Please give them the ball."
The player doesn‚Äôt have to be a HOF. I could see Someone like Khris Middleton inducting him
"Playoff basketball is not the same as regular season...he ran out of gas when he had to face Giannis, Khris Middleton, PJ Tucker and Jrue Holiday guarding and double teaming him at all times."
The Khris Middleton special
[i've posted giannis highlights](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/qrax67/highlight_giannis_with_the_block_on_toppin/) and [khris middleton highlights](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/qwfhrz/highlight_khris_middleton_ties_ray_allen_with/) too  y'all just spazzing out because of a couple lowlights than basically every other star has to deal with too
someone said khris middleton a wannabe micheal redd lmaooo
Khris Middleton is the definition of a Microwave player
"I read the title quickly and didn't notice ""Giannis"", and I was like Khris Middleton was in a GQ photo shoot? Lol"
"Kevin Durant  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Joel Embiid  Kawhi Leonard  LeBron James  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Donovan Mitchell  Jayson Tatum  Trae Young  Devin Booker  Zion Williamson  Chris Paul  Rudy Gobert  Kyrie Irving  Jimmy Butler  Bradley Beal  Paul George  Jrue Holiday  Khris Middleton  Julius Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Klay Thompson  DeAndre Ayton  Ja Morant  Karl-Anthony Towns  Domantas Sabonis  Zach LaVine  Brandon Ingram  Tobias Harris  Nikola Vucevic  CJ McCollum  Jamal Murray  Kyle Lowry  Draymond Green  Pascal Siakam  Evan Mobley  Darius Garland  Pretty sure that's over 40 players, but injuries aside, I'd take all of them before Simmons in a playoff series. People don't realize just how talented the league is right now. 40 sounds like a lot but when you list 'em out? It seems about right."
"If he's actually injured/sick, then he could still be paid. The same way Klay Thompson is paid even though he's injured, and Khris Middleton is paid even though he's sick.   The disagreement is over whether he's actually injured/sick. And there's probably certain procedures that have to be followed for whatever the NBA's version of ""calling out sick"" is."
"CJ has literally been one of the best 2nd options at guard in the league for the past 5 years. 76ers fans don‚Äôt understand that for most teams a 2nd option is not Anthony Davis or James Harden. For most teams the 2nd option is Bojan Bogdanovic, CJ McCollum, Khris Middleton, Jamal Murray, or even Reggie Jackson or RJ Barrett. And out of all of those players CJ is the best scorer AND playmaker you can get."
Khris Middleton look like Smokey from the PJs.
"khris: haha I'm having fun banter with my friend  reddit: KHRIS MIDDLETON YOU DISGUSTING SUBHUMAN, YOU'RE FUCKING **UGLY**"
[yes](https://www.google.com/search?q=khris+middleton+fish&amp;client=ms-android-att-us-revc&amp;prmd=insxv&amp;sxsrf=AOaemvJWrVwFSQpRDmk2KfDK1ciOdBHv0g:1637101598850&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjvrYra9p30AhWioFsKHUkkDnMQ_AUoAXoECAIQAQ&amp;biw=421&amp;bih=739&amp;dpr=2.57#imgrc=_4dvFYD6dUZkLM)
Ngl i actually think khris middleton is kinda cute . Like he's the right amount of medium ugly and he has a beaming smile
"They do when you're trying to argue that AD carried the team to a title, not to a finals appearance. And no, he wasn't 'undeniably' the best, he just had the best boxscore which is the same for you.   Like it's literally mind boggling to compare *LeBron James* to jrue holiday and khris middleton. AD could always afford to not be the best player on the team, as he did in the last 6 games. That was never an option for Giannis."
"Khris Middleton in 1st and 2nd quarter against crippled Nets:  5 points, 2/11 shooting   Is this what we're doing, cherry picking shit?"
"Khris Middleton In 4th and OT:    - 5-10 FG, 13 pts (most on the team over that time)  -  Scored or assisted on 18 of their 33 pts  - Held Kevin Durant to 1-4 FG as the primary defender"
Also Marc Gasol and Khris Middleton but Jokic is the best
"No Middleton, Donte, Lopez or Hill. Giannis probable. Khris expected to be back for the next game."
"Wow it's rare to see someone not being a homer after a chip lol   Jrue was absolutely atrocious in the playoffs, Khris and him were getting absolutely killed by fans and media (deservedly so) during the nets series and forward, but it was all shrugged under the rug cause they won the championship (and because Middleton had big games in the finals).   But the problems are still there, you're not beating the Nets again if Khris and him pull another series like that, they have to be more consistent."
"Bubble TJ Warren/Murray  Masked LeBron or ""Playoff mode"" LeBron as sorta an anti-mythical player.  Khris ""50/50 MJ or Kuzma"" Middleton  Staples Melo  Joe Johnson with 1 minute left in the 4th   Wiggins when facing LeBron   Wheelchair Paul Pierce   TNT Bulls    Every white nba player ever"
Yeah that‚Äôs absolutely a risk. What about if I change the example. What if Kawhi were healthy and the Clippers offered Kawhi for Khris Middleton and Giannis said no don‚Äôt trade Khris. Should the team make the trade anyway?
"What do you think Denver thought when they drafted Nikola Jokic? Or what Utah thought when they drafted Gobert and Mitchell. What do you think Spurs thought when they reloaded with Ginobili, Parker and Kawhi? Tanking that's more then using an occasional opportunity (star gets hurt, local super talent comes up) is just a cover up for lousy management and destroys any winning culture and some young careers. Just to be celebrated to take no-brainer at 2 or 3. Lame. You don't tank for a Khris Middleton or Fred Van Vleet but those have rings on them.  GMs can't be celebrated for their success via tanking when others had even bigger success without tanking in the meantime. It only makes their lack of sportsmanship more obvious."
Alabama Incest Starting lineup  PG: Trey Young   SG: Alex Caruso  SF: Khris Middleton  PF: Draymond Green  C: Boban Marjanovic
This is exactly what taking advantage of the moment. Khris Middleton is sidelined. Grayson Allen steps up and who would have thought he would deliver.
Poor mans Khris Middleton
"The Boston Celtics OBLITERATE the defending champion Milwaukee Bucks behind WINNING performances from team LEADERS Jayson Tatum and Marcus Smart.    The Celtics held superstars Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton to ZERO points combined.  This was all done without Jaylen Brown, who was suspiciously ABSENT from the Celtics lineup with what is *alleged* to be a hamstring injury.  This performance begs the question: *are the Celtics better without Jaylen Brown?*  and certainly gives support to the whispers of respectable but yet-unnamed r/nba shitposters who insist that a Jaylen Brown for Ben Simmons trade is imminent."

"The Clippers certainly did. Not ‚Äúany chance they got‚Äù but enough for it to be notable. It wasn‚Äôt just my eye test either. It got explicitly mentioned in the article from the athletic previewing the bucks/Suns finals:  &gt; Who‚Äôs guarding Khris Middleton? No matter who it is ‚Äî Mikal Bridges likely ‚Äî the Bucks would be smart to hunt Booker like the Clippers did. Marcus Morris Sr. was cooking in the mid-post against Booker. The Clippers shot 51 of 96 when Booker was defending. That 53.1 percent shooting was 6.2 percent higher than their collective average. No Suns player defended more Clippers attempts than Booker, by design."
"&gt; My point was that you're being dense if you really believe there are no non-all star players the 6ers could get that help them. They are literally 1 piece away from being a contender RIGHT NOW.  So again, who are these above average pass-first PGs that are available and would work in a deal for Simmons?  &gt; but you can't really act like Jrue was a proven player before he went to the Bucks.   Just because you didn't know anything about Jrue Holiday doesn't mean nobody knew anything about Jrue Holiday, friend.  &gt; You underrate how good Embiid is. He was 2nd in MVP voting last year and if he played more games he may have actually won it.   He would have, but he didn't. Also, when was the last time a team won the championship whose second best player was of the caliber of Seth Curry?  &gt; He doesn't need another superstar, just like how the Suns and Bucks did not.  Your argument is that Giannis/Middleton/Holiday is a similar caliber lineup as Embiid/Seth Curry/Tobias Harris? Or, to your (unrealistic) example, Embiid/Rubio/Curry? Really? Same with CP3/Booker/Ayton?  I don't really care to debate the definition of the term ""superstar"", but I also never said he needed a superstar. I said mediocre role players wouldn't cut it, which is pretty objectively true. Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday are both a tier above ""role player"" even if they're a tier or two below ""superstar"".   &gt; If Morey can't find a trade for a non-all star like Jrue or some other player like him, and the 6ers don't win a chip with him doing whatever the fuck he's trying to do, I think we gotta reconsider if he's that good of a GM...  I _again_ ask where these players are that are of the caliber of Jrue Holiday that are available for Simmons? I think you're really underrate Jrue Holiday. Like a lot."
Or how sustainable that kind of tactic will be generally when we have Khris Middleton back.
I thought that Brandon Knight was a future all star in 2017(?). That year we traded him for MCW and extended Khris instead. I was upset and thought Knight deserved the extension over Middleton.
Khris Middleton is better than Devin Booker? Idk if that‚Äôs such a hot take I‚Äôll still stand by it today
"Sixers were also missing Curry.  Ben Simmons, Seth Curry, Khris Middleton, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid would be a very good starting 5.   Donte, Brook, and Thybulle off the bench is not a bad 8 man rotation."
"Could make a pretty great team from the inactive list for this game  MIL: Donte DiVincenzo, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Sandro Mamukelashvili  PHI: Grant Riller, Isaiah Joe, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid, Matisse Thybulle, Ben Simmons"

Khris Middleton?

"No. Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, and Donte. All on the roster still....."
Khris Middleton
Khris Middleton
Khris Middleton to throw in another name that people haven't mentioned. And would agree with the people that said Kyle Lowry.  The way Lowry has become better and better even after hitting his (or what was supposed to be) prime is great to see
"Sports fans really change opinion at the minute , I can't count the number of ""Middleton can't be a second option for a championship team"" I saw last season and even then he was very inconsistent during the playoffs , True had a TS of around 40% against the Nets , Giannis had to carry in many games. True and Khris were incredible overall but I just think it's funny how opinions change"
"Yes, [yes I do](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/psavhc/russell_westbrook_working_on_his_new_jumpshot/hdpzpla/?context=999).  &gt; As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.  &gt;  &gt; Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.  &gt;  &gt; Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.  &gt;  &gt; It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.  &gt;  &gt; Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters: &gt;  &gt; |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| &gt; |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| &gt; |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| &gt; |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| &gt; |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| &gt; |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| &gt; |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| &gt; |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| &gt; |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| &gt; |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| &gt; |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| &gt; |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| &gt; |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| &gt; |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| &gt; |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| &gt; |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| &gt; |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| &gt; |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| &gt; |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| &gt; |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| &gt; |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| &gt; |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| &gt; |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| &gt; |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| &gt; |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| &gt; |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| &gt; |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| &gt; |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| &gt; |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| &gt; |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| &gt; |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| &gt; |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| &gt; |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| &gt; |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| &gt; |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393| &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) &gt; Generated 9/21/2021."
Looking like 2018 Round 1 Game 1 Khris Middleton
"robert covington got a solid contact too, khris middleton as well"
"Khris Middleton is probably the most unrecognizable/overlooked all-star/all-star level player  Except in Korea, where he actually kind of has quite a following -- [if you go to any of the videos on his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCCdgjLlukU) it's like 99% Korean comments lol"
Plus we just learned that Khris Middleton is really JK Middleton...  NBA is Hogwarts confirmed.
"""Khris Middleton can go fuck himself, though"""
Khris Middleton - James
"Too bad Luka is in the West, because that dude got some serious ""fuck the Celtics"" energy  If Boston already thinks Khris Middleton is the Boogeyman, I wonder what would they think of Luka after an entire playoff series against him"
"Yeah, if only we had like a Jrue Holiday or Khris Middleton or something, we‚Äôd probably be pretty good."
"Celtics fans, who would you rather face in a game 7, Luka or khris middleton?"
"Randle is currently 14th in the league in Win Shares, 23rd in BPM, 12th in VORP, and 10th in RAPTOR WAR.  He's putting up career high points, rebounds, and assists (22.4/11.1/5.6). He hasn't missed a game this season and leads the league in minutes played.  I think he should be considered a lock for the all-star team if you're looking at stats, both traditional and advanced. He has a stronger statistical argument than guys like Trae Young, Khris Middleton, Bradley Beal, Bam Adebayo, Kyrie Irving, Zach Lavine, Domantas Sabonis, and Ben Simmons.  You can make individual arguments here and there, Kyrie/Beal/Trae/Lavine's scoring numbers, Bam and Simmons' defense, playmaking, team record, etc. But take the overall package and compare Randle to each, and I think Randle deserves a spot more than most of those guys."
"That might be because Donovan is a more popular player and his best playoff moments are highly memorable (popping off vs the Nuggets, taking out the Thunder as a rookie) while the Bucks are known for their playoff disappointments. In reality, both guys have their share of gems and duds in the playoffs.   The Jazz haven't clinched the best record in the league, so until then Middleton has two more seasons of being the second best guy on the team with the best record. And from watching both of them this season, here are my takeaways.  * Khris is having his best season from an individual standpoint. He's shooting a little sharper, his defense is about the same, but his playmaking has taken a massive leap so far. Their record isn't as good because that's what happens when you trade your depth for Jrue Holiday. A lack of depth is exposing Bud's coaching before the playoffs this season especially since Jrue's missing some time.   * Donovan is about the same, maybe *slightly* better than last season. Maybe a Jazz fan will debate me here, but the Jazz improved so much because Gobert and Conley are playing better than they ever have. Snyder's system is also working to perfection and they're getting the most out of every role player.   * Don't have the time or IQ to articulate everything but Khris is a better shooter, playmaker, and defender. Mitchell is more explosive, a better high volume scorer, and has higher highs. It's quite close but I'd pick Middleton over Mitchell in a vacuum with some confidence."
People saying Khris Middleton is on that gas rn
Surprised a Bucks flair isn't saying Middleton. There's not a lot of guys on that list I'd pick over Mitchell but Khris was one of the first names I thought of.
"I think he's worthy, the question is: who are you kicking off this list?   Giannis  KD  Harden  Kyrie  Embiid  Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Trae Young  Bam  Beal  Khris Middleton  Zach Lavine   And that's without mentioning Gordon Hayward, Sabonis/Turner from Indy, FVV/Lowry/Siakam or Vucevic plus whoever else I am forgetting (and I am undoubtedly forgetting some good candidates).  All-Star is no joke this year in either conference."
Yeah? Like drafting Khris Middleton at 39 or Dinwiddie at 38?  Or how about recently Saddiq Bey at 19? How's your boy Nesmith doing? Your genius franchise drafted him at 14 LMFAO
"Giannis Antetokounmpo, it‚Äôs alien to see him run screens with 6‚Äô6 Khris Middleton as the screener, and then the next play do the opposite"
"Game close, time for Bud‚Äôs secrit plays. Dribble hand-off for a heavily contested Khris Middleton 3.   Bud‚Äôs face when he misses:   :O"
"You put his ceiling at 25 ppg, it's literally right there in your comment. That's a straight up lie. In no world is he ever scoring 25ppg ever. 20 is surprising too, cause they're plenty more offensively talented players the Kuzma averaging less on terrible teams. D'Lo for example. All the players averaging 20 ppg are miles better then Kuz. Khris Middleton, Sabonis, Pascal. Kuzma is not averaging an easy 20+ on any team in the league."
"1: bojan - (bench) mikal bridges - (cut) OG 2: Khris Middleton - (bench) Fred VV - (cut) Lavine  3: Halliburton - (bench) Gray Trent - (cut) Lonzo  4: kuzma- (bench) KCP - (cut) Carmelo 5: Dame - (bench) CP3 - (cut) - Kyrie  This was really tough. Number 2 and 5 were the toughest. Middleton and FVV have proven themselves as being able to play in high leverage games. Lavine probably has the highest upside but is just not as proven.  Secondly, I think Kyrie just has to be the odd one out as he would be the last one I would want on my team as you just never know what he‚Äôll do. For instance this year he just didn‚Äôt show up for 7 games. The nets had harden and Durant so they were fine, but if you‚Äôre team wasn‚Äôt as talented and was depending more on him?? Yeah. Not great."
"Probably someone like Khris Middleton, assuming you mean can possibly win a championship not guaranteed to win a championship. I think to guarantee a championship the player would have to be a decent playmaker, good at defense, and multi dimensional on offense (unless you're Giannis and are great at finishing)."
"&gt;Saddiq Bey has shot a combined 12/15 from 3 in both Detroit's wins vs the Celtics.  Saddiq ""Khris Middleton"" Bey"
PG without athleticism = Khris Middleton
Funny how a helpless defender like Bridges was able to lock up Khris Middleton.
I'm not a big fan of giannis but khris Middleton is the most underrated player in the league. So ill give you this hot take. Giannis/Middleton. Obviously LeBron and AD but I love the bucks duo
"You‚Äôre acting like efficiency is the thing that ends all player debate arguments. Are Khris Middleton and Malcolm Brogdon better than peak Westbrook too? After all, they‚Äôve both been in the 50/40/90 club and Russ hasn‚Äôt. Shit, I guess they‚Äôre better than MJ and LeBron too.   Russ dragged a garbage tier team that wouldn‚Äôt win 10 games without him to the sixth seed in a brutally tough Western conference. They had literally no other playmakers on that team, and for a guy that wasn‚Äôt very good at shooting jumpers, Presti didn‚Äôt surround him with any legit floor spacers either. The team couldn‚Äôt keep a lead against a particularly aggressive group of pylons without Westbrook spoon feeding them easy points.   I‚Äôd be interested to see how Steph would do with no other intelligent players like Draymond on his team, and no other three point threats for that matter. He wouldn‚Äôt be much more efficient than Westbrook was if I had to guess. And that‚Äôs with me not even mentioning that Steve Kerr is a significantly better coach than Billy Donovan was back then."
Oh I got one;  Sam Cassel‚Äôs donkey teeth + Ray Allen‚Äôs mid range shooting + KD‚Äôs weird body frame = Khris Middleton
Imagine being Khris Middleton. Poor guy
"I remember the guy who was ranting about using initials for players who are unknown or who don't deserve it  I feel the same way with using first names only of players. It's okay if it's Giannis, LeBron, Kawhi or Steph, but it's getting annoying when it's used for players like Khris (Middleton), Jaylen (Brown) or Jayson (Tatum)"
"the Khris Middleton disrespect is real, he has been elite this season"
"You think that in the regular season, LeBron had an actual argument for being MVP over Giannis? Let's really quick go through that statement  Record: Bucks won more games than the Lakers  Statistics: Giannis had more PPG, rebounds, less turnovers, more blocks, was a better defender (some would say DPOY level), had a higher TS% on less minutes per game and got subbed out in the second half regularly.   Help: LeBron had Anthony Davis, Giannis had Khris Middleton  The only possible argument for LeBron last year was narrative."
Nope he would be smarter and pass to elite 3 point shooter khris middleton
"&gt;The NBA does not reveal which players test positive for COVID-19, but Milwaukee‚Äôs Khris Middleton said earlier this week that Bucks guard Jrue Holiday tested positive for the virus. That would make Holiday the one player in the NBA‚Äôs Wednesday announcement."

"Last year the Bucks had the best record in the NBA. This year they‚Äôre 5th. Giannis got off to a slow start so his name wasn‚Äôt thrown around early on. But I agree. There‚Äôs a handful of names floating around, but Giannis has been ignored for a while. If he keeps playing like he has been and they get top-3 he could definitely win.  Khris Middleton has also been great for them. He could be drawing some of that attention towards him. Don‚Äôt hear much of his name anywhere either, but Milwaukee I guess.  There‚Äôs just a lot of good players/narratives so everyone‚Äôs looking past him for now."
"*Posting my comment from the r/mkebucks thread because some people thought it was poor play design:*  That last play was well-designed, I just think Giannis tried to play hero ball. I'm assuming the Suns thought that if Giannis got the ball, he would definitely try to drive. So they decided to leave Middleton open in the corner, and Giannis was supposed to pass it there after receiving the ball.  You can see CP3 leave Middleton wide open as soon as he sees the pass going to Giannis. Booker doesn't switch, and stays in the lane. If Giannis passes it right away, Middleton has over 1 second to get a good shot off, with Booker closing in late.  Instead, he decided to try and hit the pullup jumper. Maybe he was planning to drive, assuming Booker would switch onto Middleton? And when he didn't it threw him off?  Idk. Either way this doesn't seem like a flaw in play design.  https://i.imgur.com/o0kmk9w.jpg  Here‚Äôs a picture I took about a half second after the inbound. CP3 closing in on Giannis while Middleton‚Äôs wide open yelling for the ball. Booker looks like he‚Äôs ready to close in, but when Giannis first got the ball he was focusing solely on him. Khris could have gotten a great shot off easily."
I think the raptors should Kyle Lowry to the Bucks for Khris Middleton.
"Gg Suns. Ok losing this game without jrue. Huge difference when we can put 5 good defensive players on court instead of 4 at once. Also, bucks were bad without Giannis. Jrue+Khris can play well without Giannis. Just Middleton not as effective."
I think they were trying to but CP3 left the inbounder to guard middleton. I'm guessing he saw it coming since this looks veryyyy similar to the play they ran against brooklyn at the end of the game when Khris missed the corner 3
Khris Middleton is not enjoying Mikal Jail
As a chihuahua owner i want to know why my dog has khris middleton eyes.
"john 'khris middleton against the celtics"" colliins"
"I said what I said! Lol I‚Äôll MAYBE give Simmons the edge this year and only this year. I‚Äôll give you that since Melo is fresh out the gates.   But in today‚Äôs game I don‚Äôt rubber stamp ‚Äòexperience‚Äô as makin guys better. For reference, over a year ago I said Jaylen brown was better than Khris Middleton ans this sub was up on arms. How does that look? So yea I don‚Äôt follow narratives or base it on experience, I go by their straight up game. So for for a list of best PGs for next year yea I‚Äôm ranking Melo higher. He‚Äôs that good and Ben is that bleh.   And I know what people will do: the first thing they‚Äôll mention when talking about Ben‚Äî-is the *Sixers* success. Dead giveaway. People do the same with Draymond green. I don‚Äôt conflate a team‚Äôs success with a players actual game. A player can be a good fit and you can‚Äôt get accustomed to seeing them win WITH him, but that doesn‚Äôt make the individual player better then what he is. 76ers are this good bc of Embiid, chemistry, Tobias, and Doc (contrary to popular belief he is a good reg season coach). Yes Ben plays good D but it‚Äôs overblown at this point. He will be the reason they get booted in the playoffs bc he can‚Äôt score"
I know for a fact Khris Middleton is averaging those numbers. Don't trust you.
"Shaq didn‚Äôt win anything ever ‚Äúby himself‚Äù he had penny, then Kobe, then wade, then Nash/amare, then Lebron, then the Celtics whole team. Giannis best teammate so far has been khris Middleton"
I gotta be honest I had to stop at 11 when you had KHRIS MIDDLETON and Gobert a top 20 player while KAT is barely top 40 lmao
"Steph Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis   Damian Lillard, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Jayson Tatum, Bam Adebayo   Then honestly take your pick for the last two spots out of:  Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, Zach LaVine, CJ McCollum, Khris Middleton, Trae Young, Myles Turner, Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, DeMar DeRozan, Zion Williamson... etc etc..."
Don‚Äôt know why your getting downvoted. There is no fucking way Khris Middleton makes it over AD and even Tatum
AD isn't a majority center this season. The voters would put him at forward before they omitted him in favor Khris fucking Middleton (no disrespect)
Perks of being a Laker. Kuzma and Caruso are a lot more popular than Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday.

"Khris Middleton isn't that boring of a name, tbh"
I love Khris Middleton
"&gt;Jokic's MVP season is being destroyed by his teammates   If he really was the MVP, then the Nuggets should have won. The real MVP of the game and best player on the floor was Giannis and Khris Middleton. They are the ones who made game changing plays over and over again. Didn't just get ""numbers"".   &gt;  Just ""numbers"" don't mean anything. What you do and when.. especially when your team needs something the most, MEANS EVERYTHING.  Jokic didn't do much in the 4th Q at all.   &gt;  Some of you poor fools are so blinded by raw statistical numbers from players in this fast paced era and regular season.. that you don't see the real picture.   &gt;   Giannis and the Bucks dominated the entire game.   There wasn't even a single moment since Tip off,  where the Nuggets ever was in the game.   &gt;  Bucks are also nowhere near as ""elite"" of a defensive team right now. They were supposed to be, but they are not. Especially their paint defense. It's been pretty fuckin shit this season."
Khris Middleton has the opportunity to show he's the number two on a championship team.  He should take it.
Because he doesn't really get the respect he deserves from the media.  You never see Khris Middleton highlights get posted anywhere so the casuals don't ever see him play.
I wish someone could explain to me why Khris Middleton doesn't get the respect he deserves on this sub.
What has Khris Middleton done to prove he can be a second option?  In his last straight 3 playoff series‚Äôs he is averaging 17.8 points on 39% from the field and 33% from three and lead the league in fouls with 4 a game. I‚Äôm not hating but it‚Äôs way to premature to say he can be a second option on a title team when he only has balled out in the regular season and in that 2018 Celtics series
"I fully respect Khris Middleton. I'm an atheist, but the dude puts the fear of God in me every time he play the C's."
"I think Khris ends up being our playoff closer this year.  Can handle, play make, shoot the the tough shots.  Giannis is a great roll man, and it means less worrying about Giannis hitting clutch FTs.  We need to take advantage of Middleton making another jump."
Khris Middleton has improved every year since he got his contract. He has closed out a handful of games for us with great poise and leadership.
Middleton and DiVincenzo so so good down the stretch. Didn't realize Khris had this kind of playmaking ability but that could be an X-factor for the Bucks in the postseason
I feel like a Khris Middleton is the exact type of player the Nuggets are missing.
Khris Middleton fadeaways give me chills
"That's soon to be 3 time all star Khris ""Kash Money"" Middleton to you"
"It's hard to be as good as Khris Middleton, there's no shame in it"
"40 13 does not happen every night, and I fetched Khris Middleton for him so..."
"1. Al Horford was supposed to be the ‚ÄúGiannis Stopper‚Äù after the 2018 playoffs, where Khris was the main factor then.  2. Why the hell do you keep bringing up Middleton lol? 20 ppg helped but I‚Äôd much rather try containing 30 ppg"
I was wrong about being wrong about being wrong about Khris Middleton
"I certainly don't. Especially not in the playoffs. I could understand someone choosing Khris over Jamal but he's certainly not much better.  Going back to the other argument - last play of a playoff game to win it, who would you rather have the ball.  One thing I'd say is I think if you could have a team where Middleton and Giannis played defence and Jokic and Murray could sub in for them on offence, no one is stopping that team"
"He's had more bad playoff series than good ones, its not rocket science. Ask yourself do you really believe he performs the same in the playoffs compared to the regular season?  His inconsistency is on full display in this Nets series alone, dude was absolute ass in the first 2 games then suddenly turned it up to help the Bucks take game 3. Its anybody's guess which Khris Middleton is gonna show up for game 4."
"I'd really not call Jrue in the playoff as a 3-level scorer, forget facilitator.   Same with Middleton.   Since they don't have picks they'll have to actually dump Khris+Jrue for a fellow superstar plus a squad player."

You have to go over the screen on Khris Middleton.
"Yeah maybe, but I'd rather say that we attracted another guard on a good contract in free agency to space the floor, instead of letting Khris Middleton hog all the cap space."
"Man I'm like the biggest Bud hater and at times in the Miami series I was like... am I wrong? Is this dude competent? We are actually running plays. What was this, a Middleton / Giannis PnR resulting in a lob? Another one with an open midrange for Khris? Players were actually moving on offense. Screens followed by a hand-off for Forbes with Giannis rolling. We are so bad this series, again... KD saved what's left of Bud's reputation with those bricks, the 4th quarter would have been garbage time again."
Paul George is to the Clippers as Khris Middleton is to the Bucks.
"The first quarter was good offensively, especially at the start. They were actually running plays, I saw one or two double screens even. I can't remember the last time I saw Khris coming off an off-ball screen. There was a offensive possession with *3 passes*, when have we ever done that? And then would you look at that Giannis and Middleton are feasting and we're up by like 20.  And then we totally forgot about all of that and let Brooklyn back into the game"
"I know Bucks fans like to complain about Bud not giving Giannis more minutes in the playoffs, but it seems like every time Giannis gets 38+ minutes his 4th quarters aren't pretty.  There was a 3 minute stretch in the fourth where Giannis fumbled an easy pass on a roll, fell when driving with very little contact, set a pick on Khris Middleton instead of Middleton's defender where the Nets got an easy 2 off the turnover, and had an open lane to roll down after setting a pick but just stood there.  After starting the game so strong, Giannis just got bodied in the fourth by a 32-year-old Blake Griffin.  Griffin is playing a heck of a series, but I take back most of my complaints I made about Bud not playing Giannis more in the playoffs."
He thought he was Khris Middleton or some shit?
They could be so much more lethal if Jrue was the ball handler running a pick and roll with Giannis. Like imagine Giannis rim running with Jrue attacking and Khris Middleton waiting for the dish to iso or Lopez stretching the floor.   Compare that to the weird Giannis drive and kick mid air pass that they currently run
Luckily the bucks had Khris Middleton and the Nets only had  Kevin Durant
Someone at the veryyy beginning of the game thread before the game even started said something like ‚Äúthis game is gunna be known as the Khris Middleton game‚Äù   damn go buy a lotto ticket tonight man!!

Khris Middleton with the hard carry

Khris Middleton an actual shooter
kate middleton has departed and Khris Middleton has arrived
KHRIS MIDDLETON I NEVER DOUBTED YOU
"Khris ""Playing against the Celtics"" Middleton has arrived."
Pistons Legend Khris Middleton  FTFY
Khris Middleton has to step up this game. Giannis can't do it all on his own. Get your buckets Khris.
"I think the KD's bucks is a very interesting idea. I do think they would beat these nets, even if you put a decent kd replacement like idk Tobias Harris, as opposed to the even swap for giannis cause he's playing so poorly  But Khris Middleton is playing like crap too and I think the whole team hasn't played up to usual. I'm looking forward to today's game and hoping the bucks take at least 2 games if not more. They certainly can if they tighten up"
Let this be known as the Khris Middleton game
"Yeah, I don‚Äôt think people get that it‚Äôs about his individual performance. If he averages 30/14/6 like he does in the regular season but loses because Khris Middleton decided to take up bricklaying as a profession, he‚Äôd get far less shit. The Bucks have lost over the last two playoffs in significant part because of huge, repeatedly exploitable holes in his game."
Where‚Äôs Khris Middleton? He‚Äôs going to drop 42 tonight.
"&gt; The national basketball team for Yugoslavia if it still existed would be nuts and could 100% take down Team USA.  I think 100% beating Team USA is hyperbolic unless they're playing the same 2019 roster, in this hypothetical scenario, which included: Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Joe Harris, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Donovan Mitchell, Mason Plumlee, Marcus Smart, Jayson Tatum, Myles Turner, Kemba Walker, Derrick White.  That being said, a Yugoslavian team would wreck shop."
"They do have shooters. Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez and PJ Tucker were all intended to be complementary shooters to pair with Giannis‚Äô interior scoring. It‚Äôs a coaching issue, and a Giannis ft issue."
"But at some point, the focus has to be on the players on the court. The coach can‚Äôt make the players lock up defensively or shoot lights out. Doesn‚Äôt matter if Greg Popovich was the coach of the Bucks. They‚Äôve consistently improved the supporting cast year after year with disappointing results.   Jrue Holiday/Khris Middleton as co stars, a primeir 3/D center and a good bench. That is more than enough for the true superstars in the game, which is why I say Giannis‚Äôs accolades don‚Äôt match his true value. You simply have to perform at some point. If you have to get your best player ‚Äúopen looks‚Äù, they simply aren‚Äôt *that guy*."
"The gap between the team the US put out two years ago and its best team is massive. If the US actually sent their best players, you're looking at something like:  Steph curry, LeBron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, Draymond Green, and DeAndre Ayton.   The team that they actually sent was:  Marcus smart, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen brown, Harrison Barnes, Derrick white, Mason plumlee, Khris Middleton, Kemba walker, Joe Harris, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, and Donovan Mitchell."
"Khris middleton has 34% true shooting. that's pretty trash. ""second option"""
Khris middleton has 34% true shooting. it doesn't get much more unhelpful than that
The people saying Giannis has such a good team around him obviously haven't been watching Khris middleton or half the bucks roster this series. They're ass right now
Is Khris Middleton like Raheem Sterling
"Khris Middleton plays a lot like him too but the later stage Kobe.  DeMar has a ton of similarities too, Kawhi as well."
I don't know. Khris is a streaky shooter that struggles against tough defense like the Nets have been playing. I haven't seen CJ much but if he doesn't go 0/8 in a quarter it may be a decent trade. Middleton can beat teams like the Heat and Celtics but when Raptors defense or Nets come around he just disappears. Frustrating as hell.
khris middleton maybe
Nah the Knicks gotta save that cap space for Khris Middleton.
The difference in game 1 was that their roleplayers outplayed our stars (Other than Giannis). Khris Middleton was probably the 12th-best player in the game.  The difference in game 2 was just about everything.
"True say, Western Khris Middleton."
"One hundred percent agree but Middleton can also defend and pass, I'm not arguing just saying let's give khris a little love lmao"
What happened to Khris Middleton. Weren‚Äôt some people saying he‚Äôs the 2nd star on the team?
Comparing him to Khris Middleton is definitely not okay LMAO
"No. PG is closer to Kawhi than Khris Middleton.  The only reason he's not a superstar is he's consistently subpar (for his level) in the playoffs. At worst, he's a star.   He has the tools to be a superstar, versatile offensive game, can get hot from deep, crafty at finishing, decent passing, elite defense. I can't find any other reason other than it's mental with him on how much his game goes down in the playoffs.   Finishing 3rd in MVP and DPOY race in the same year is rare even if it's a glimpse of his ceiling instead of his usual level  28/8/4 with 2 steals (league leader) with all defense 1st team is about as high as you could expect from a non-GOAT tier player"
No shit hes not as good as Kawhi but he's in a different league from Khris Middleton
Paul George is so much better than Khris Middleton. What is wrong with y'all lol do you even watch the games
"Giannis does not have success guarding Durant. Plus, that would just make him tired on the offensive end. Their best bet is Khris Middleton."
"I mean, Giannis at least played well in Game 1 of the Semifinals. Paul George, on the other hand...  Should also be noted that Paul George has better teammates than Giannis does (I'd take Kawhi Leonard, Marcus Morris, Serge Ibaka, and Lou Williams in a heartbeat over Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday, and Brook Lopez)."
&gt;sharing the offensive burden with Jimmy Buckets  Great point actually. Meanwhile Khris Middleton.....
"Yes analytics guys like Ben Taylor also watch film and understand schemes. Still doesn‚Äôt change the fact that they were completely wrong about KD and Kyrie. Do you realize that the Nets were blowing out the Bucks by 49 points at one point? A Bucks team that has Jrue Holiday, Giannis, Khris Middleton along with Brook Lopez, PJ Tucker, and other solid role players. There is a swagger to the game of basketball that dudes like Ben Taylor don‚Äôt understand. Kyrie and KD only combined for 54 points but the way in which they scored was amazing and effortless. It made the Bucks hesitant to play their gritty, physical style and they fell into the trap of trying to match KD and Kyrie‚Äôs coolness/ swagger/ shotmaking ability which very few can do. Not only that. When you see your teammates making highlight reel type plays every trip down the court it gives the teammates supreme confidence. Bruce Brown‚Äôs floater game was on another level. Landry Shamet banged two back to back laser beam three pointers.   In short, basketball is about confidence and when you have two of the most skilled scorers ever on your team who don‚Äôt let the ball stick in their hands then that confidence becomes infectious. There are no analytics for this. Ben Taylor probably knows this but chooses not to bring it up because again there are no analytics for this."
"LOL it sounds like you said if you gave Giannis Kyrie, KD AND Khris Middleton it would be 2-0 Milwaukee."
Is PG just Khris Middleton with a mask on?
Pandemic P watched Khris Middleton and got triggered
That's the under statement of the year lol.  Khris Middleton turns into Steph Curry whenever he plays us!!!
 khris Middleton is the worst #2
Nah he could be a #1 khris Middleton or holiday aren't #2 on a championship team
Khris Middleton being voted an all star... overrated time and time again now being exposed.
2 time all stars Khris Middleton and Domantas Sabonis would argue with you
Khris Middleton over Trevor Ariza
"well you said he never shows up and then just named two series where he was fantastic - not every player is just gonna perform to the level of their contract in every playoffs. Ask Khris Middleton. Ask Paul George. Ask Jimmy Butler. Those guys have all looked unplayable at times, sometimes multiple times in the playoffs. And the regular season is actually a real thing that matters. CJ was great this year and has been great for a number of years as a scoring guard. He shot 9 threes a game and made 40%. Ya know how many guys can do that? Plenty of metrics paints him as a big-time offensive contributor on the level of Jimmy Butler and Paul George. That's how efficient his scoring is. Obviously, he's a much worse player in other aspects of the game, that's why he's not a star. But you're not just replacing his production with Norm Powell. It's not that easy."
"I mean the bucks have Jrue, Giannis, and Middleton. They're not exactly slouches. Yall could be a lot more competitive in these games if Khris actually showed up and Giannis goes to the rim and plays more minutes. I mean they're missing Harden and you're still losing by 40 man, thats not bc they're a superteam. Also the Nets aren't forcing the Bucks to stop playing defense 5 minutes into the game."
"Yeah idk what people are smoking here. Khris is the type of player we need, someone that can create their own shot while still being able to playmake a bit. Giannis needs a better secind option than khris since when khris is playing like shit teams can clogg the paint and make life really hard for Giannis. Luka is more versatile on offense and can still make plays and even help middleton get going when he is being inconsistent."
Playoff Khris Middleton is the player that loud idiots have spent the last few years trying to claim Playoff James Harden is
&gt; fuck khris middleton i want to play with some actual shooters
&gt; Khris Middleton   You watched today's game?  This won't work.
"Khris ‚Äù middle of the road"" Middleton"
"Shooting 21.5 shots per game on 34% TS will lose your team just about any game.   Giannis‚Äô much worse shooting selection that is coming on lower volume and considerably higher percentage, over 25% higher TS.   The goal IS to win games. With how Khris Middleton has been playing, he has been the worst player on the court for long stretches and is absolutely contributing to the Bucks not having a fighters chance. Yet the thought is ‚Äújust keep shooting even if you aren‚Äôt hitting‚Äù?"
"Giannis isn‚Äôt the point of this post, Khris Middleton absolutely shitting the bed is"
This series is more of the limitations of Giannis offensive game and the fraud that is Khris Middleton.   I‚Äôm not particularly fond of coach bud but Giannis not driving on Blake griffin and  not being able to guard Kyrie or Durant for that matter isnt on the coach.  Then you have Khris Middleton the 50 40 90 guy shooting for the series 30 23 50.  Will they fire bud probably but it certainly isn‚Äôt all his fault.
"Yes, and Khris Middleton was the worst. Khris Middleton has been the worst player on the court for long stretches in the first two games, and that‚Äôs of significant note for a player that is an allstar and a max player."
"I‚Äôm not saying to feel bad for him. I‚Äôm saying that he‚Äôs underperforming, but Khris Middleton is absolutely shitting the bed in a way that‚Äôs tough to watch. He is legitimately getting outplayed by Mike James."
Khris Middleton at halftime had 8/3/1 and 4 turnovers on 3-11 shooting. He deserves a shitload of blame too.
"&gt; I‚Äôve never seen a player so confidently put up 20+ shots a game while legitimately looking like a great value version of Kevin Knox. This man is butchering ball movement, is taking early shot clock contested iso shots, and can‚Äôt hit the broad side of the barn. Khris Middleton in this series is averaging more attempts per game than Kawhi Leonard, Devin Booker, Kyrie, and PG... while shooting over 20% less TS%. This man is getting paid a max contract.  Middleton scored 22 PPG on 64% TS in the first round. He's scored 21 PPG on 60% TS over the past two seasons.  Chill out over 2 games."
"Yeah, this is by no means a ‚ÄúGiannis doing good‚Äù post, it‚Äôs entirely meant as a ‚ÄúKhris Middleton is playing god awful and deserves much more of the blame‚Äù post"
"nah he is, people act like Tobias Harris and Khris Middleton are in a different tier than him and that‚Äôs big cap"
"Why is Giannis the primary ballhandler all the time anway? Khris Middleton or Jrue Holiday should be handling the ball with Giannis as the roll man. Mike Budenholzer is a fuckin fraud, if he isn't fired the Bucks are hopeless."
"Are you acting like Khris Middleton, whichever Lopez they have and his Italian nephew are things that should be winning championships?"
"The point of this is for Khris to play out on the perimeter. It doesn't work if he is driving towards the lane while Giannis rolls to the lane.. Giannis screening does open space in the lane because now he needs to be guarded on the perimeter. If they sag on Giannis when he screens Middleton can take uncontested 3s all day. This is why Draymond gets guarded on the perimeter. Sag on Draymond and he screens for Curry. While Middleton certainly isn't the shooting threat Curry is, Giannis is a significantly better roll threat than Draymond."
"Worst part is Middleton on Harden. I was fine with Giannis vs KD and Jrue vs Harden with Donte on Kyrie. But now Khris has to guard Harden which even if he does an okay job of getting murdered, we saw in the Raptors series that when he gets gassed on defense his offense really suffers, which we desperately need."
Khris Middleton in a shootout against the Nets
"Bucks vs Nets big 3:  giannis elite in scoring, defense &lt;= KD more elite in offense, above avg defense.  Jrue Holliday solid on offense, elite defense == Kyrie much better offense, below avg defense. Khris Middleton solid on offense, above avg defender &lt;= Harden elite offense , avg defense. Lopez&gt; better than any Nets big Nets have shooters - harris shamet &gt;= Forbes, can't name another shooter. Bucks Defense&gt; Nets Defense ( big 3 plus p.j. Tucker and Lopez) Verdict: I'm neutral but I'd say Nets in 7."

Khris Middleton is a bad bad man
Khris Middleton has the most satisfying jumper in the NBA usually I‚Äôd say KD or Melo but it‚Äôs just something about that Khash Money swish
Does Khris Middleton think he‚Äôs playing the Celtics or something!?!?
Khris Middleton look like Dory üòÇüòÇüòÇüò≠üò≠üò≠
You employ Khris Middleton
Oh yeah! my favorite player Khris Middleton.
Fuck Khris Middleton.
"Russ is one of my favorite guards all time. Consistently a top 10-15 player in the league throughout his career. This season though, putting him right at 25 is generous. Here‚Äôs the 24 players I have before him, and I can‚Äôt see there being an argument he outplayed any of them this year:  Joker embiid curry Durant  harden Giannis Chris Paul Devin Booker Ja morant  Kyrie Irving  Dame Ben Simmons  Rudy gobert Donovan Mitchell  Trey Young  Luka Kawhi  LeBron Anthony Davis Jayson Tatum Sabonis  Bradley Beal PG-13 Khris Middleton   That would put him at 25. I think a case could be made that Jimmy Butler or Bam would be more deserving of this spot. Also you‚Äôd have to put Jaylen Brown and Jamal Murray higher if they weren‚Äôt injured."
Jrue Holiday or Khris Middleton
"I got in a similarly heated debate about Klay Thompson vs. Khris Middleton. I argued Middleton‚Äôs shooting seasons this year and last were better than Klay‚Äôs best, because, even if Middleton‚Äôs percentages were only slightly better, he takes way, way more unassisted shots. On top of that, Middleton is a marginally better rebounder and significantly better creator.   Your next post can be on Klay‚Äôs dramatically overrated defense. There‚Äôs a reason advanced metrics rate him poorly; he‚Äôs great on ball but pretty useless as a team defender, and the eye test backs that if you look for his mistakes. People act like he‚Äôs this defensive guru, completing the perfect 3 and D player, but there‚Äôs a reason he isn‚Äôt a consistent All-Defense selection and was never even mentioned as a DPOY candidate."
"Middleton has also been a capable defender on Durant in the past. I wouldn't be surprised if both Khris and Giannis share the Durant assignment to avoid foul trouble on Giannis, and allow Giannis to be a help defender by sticking him on Blake when he's in"
"Well first, Jimmy Butler, Paul George, and Khris Middleton are not elite wings. They are super talented and great wings, but they are obviously a tier below the ‚Äúelite‚Äù wings you listed. Since 2009 the finals MVPs have been Kobe, Dirk, Lebron, Iggy, KD, and Kawhi. Do whatever you want with that information"
We have Brooke Lopez and 2 of the best rebounding guards in Pat Connaughton and Donte Divicenzo. Khris Middleton is also a decent rebounder
Except on three point attempts. Khris Middleton got three shots on Monday night on a flagrant foul.
It‚Äôs just a different situation. Giannis had to be on ball so much last year because our pg was Eric Bledsoe. Khris Middleton could handle part of the load but he‚Äôs really not strong enough to run the offense all the time. Having Jrue Holiday instead of Bledsoe allows Giannis to spend even more time off ball and Middleton to shift to more of a scorer role than creator role.
"Khris Middleton, Spencer Dinwiddie, Dennis Rodman.  Am i missing Something?"
"Remember when Middleton was a throw-in in the Knight-Jennings deal? A prospect coming off of a knee injury seen as crippling to his chances of being a quality NBA starter? I don't know anything about him personally, but every time I see his success I see someone to admire for the way he worked to get to where he is. I know all of these guys put in work, but this wasn't supposed to happen. Khris Middleton wasn't supposed to be a crucial and successful part of a team making deep playoff runs.  So much fun to see."
Khris Middleton and Spencer dinwiddie
"&gt;Like, it takes balls of steel to tell your two-time reigning MVP to ride shotgun to Khris Middleton.  Middleton was 4/5 and many of his FTs were from techs and flagrants. He played a ridiculously efficient game and really impressed with solid defense but I mean he very clearly played a lesser role this game."
"A while back someone on here said something like ""Khris Middleton is what it would look like if I tried to draw Jay-Z from memory"" and it makes me laugh every time I see him.  (Personally I think he's kinda adorable in his own way but I still can't not laugh at that description. Sorry Khris.)"
If you listened to Chris Vernon you would think Middleton is Austin Rivers.      Khris is freaking awesome
If Khris Middleton was more handsome he'd be second team All-NBA. .
Khris Middleton will do that to a man
Been some Khris Middleton on him in games too. Whole Bucks D is full of absolute menaces
Yeah and I commend him for standing up for Giannis. But Blake laughed at him as khris wagged his finger at him. Literally nobody in the NBA is intimidated by Middleton. He's just not that dude... And he don't have to be. He's too good for that.   I love Middleton I ain't trying to shit on him. He's just not the enforcer type
"You can see why it took Bud (and Giannis) so long to get there though. Like, it takes balls of steel to tell your two-time reigning MVP to ride shotgun to Khris Middleton. We were all drunk on the ""Giannis will develop a 3 and a post game and a jumper and be the most unstoppably perfect basketball player in the history of the league"" koolaid. Turns out he doesn't need to do that if they use him to his strengths and play good team basketball."
Khris Middleton got 17 points in 5 shots.
"Portis/Tucker/Jrue are the exact type of guys we've been missing. Khris Middleton seriously might have been the tough dude on our team, and he ain't that type of dude at all. Lol"
Khris Middleton has taken 5 shots this game. If he were on the Heat he'd be their leading scorer.
"Man, Jrue, Khris and Giannis is such a good trio.  Jrue is the playmaker the Bucks so desperately needed for a long time, and is an extremely composed and efficient scorer, in addition to being an elite parameter defender. Middleton is the shooter of this trio, and is a fairly good playmaker himself, and is a pretty good defender too. Giannis the big man on the inside, and the defensive anchor.  This big three is *muah* perfection"
Someone said Khris Middleton looks like a PT Cruiser lmao
helping one pass away off Khris Middleton...
Khris Middleton will forever be underrated because he‚Äôs not crazy athletic and has a boring name

"Khris ""Can't be your second option, so he became the first option"" Middleton."
Giannis never lost Khris Middleton before the playoffs started
If Middleton was the first option on any other team he would be seen as a star player by most fans. The guy is one of the most accurate shooters and is clutch in the playoffs but has only made one all-star game. Him being second to Giannis is more a testament to Giannis' skill than it is any lack of skill on Khris' part.
"It's the first time I've considered this, and it makes perfect sense, but...  Is Khris Middleton the Milwaukee Bucks' closer?"
"Fucking Khris Middleton man. Give that man the ball in the clutch then have Giannis crash the boards. You have Middleton drawing that defense towards him leaving another teammate open on the perimeter, with this time it being Jrue. You have Lopez collapsing thus distracting Bam which left Giannis wide open at the basket so even if Khris missed this shot Giannis had enough time for a tip in winner. You love to see it."
"It‚Äôs mostly people who are recent basketball fans and don‚Äôt understand the way the salary cap works.   The Bucks were basically a fourth-tier team in Wisconsin until recently. It went:  Packers  Brewers  Badgers football  Badgers basketball  Bucks  You literally could not even find a Bucks t-shirt in a department store as recently as six years ago.   Now all of these people are jumping on the bandwagon-which is fine because that‚Äôs a natural thing that happens-but they just see that we are paying Khris the same as the Clippers are paying Paul George. They see that LeBron has Davis as a second option, while Giannis has had Khris.   But they don‚Äôt understand the politics of the NBA. They don‚Äôt understand that no free agents want to come here. They don‚Äôt get that re-signing Middleton to the max, with his bird rights, is the best a small market can do.  They don‚Äôt understand, but they‚Äôre loud and they whiney."
"Nah, those fans always show up after Khris has a bad game or goes on a shooting slump for any stretch of time (he's a midrange heavy shooter, going cold for a few games isn't really surprising).    They were up in arms after he couldn't get off a shot vs the Warriors (most people were blaming him for a bad inbound pass as well, but Jrue cut at the last second and didn't go where Middleton expected right as he was inbounding), and then he went 6/27 the next game vs Dallas."
Heat fans will remember Khris Middleton being the single reason they took a game last year when Giannis hit the bench in game 4. He went fucking nuclear. He‚Äôs insanely good; always surprised when teams put below average defenders on him.
"I don't watch the Blazers, but I feel like Middleton is simply a better McCollum. Khris is a plus defender, CJ is more iffy, I feel like Middleton is consistently an All-Star (or at that level), and would've made third team All-NBA if he hadn't split votes between G and F last year."
"finished the game 8-37, throw herro in there too and it's 10-47, and they only lost by 2 in OT from a khris middleton buzzer beating game winner."
Fuckin' ~~Rudy Gay~~ Khris Middleton man
Khris Middleton is the best player in the league
The only solace I will get from being swept by the nets is not having to play fucking khris middleton
I beg to differ. ~~Happy Gilmore~~ Khris Middleton accomplished that feat no more than ~~an hour ago~~ three years ago.
KHRIS MIDDLETON IS A GROWN MAN.
"Nope, lol. But Khris ‚ÄúKlutch‚Äù Middleton is still our go-to crunch-time player; that‚Äôs more undeniable than ever."
Exactly. That's why teams build a whole defense for....Khris Middleton?
Running into the ref after hitting a game winner is the most Khris middleton thing ever
There‚Äôs Khris ‚Äúnot a real number two‚Äù Middleton for ya!
"KHRIS ""KA$H"" MIDDLETON. ENOUGH FUCKING SAID."
"Looked like Keljin Blevins compared to Duncan Robinson, Goran Dragic, and Khris Middleton"
would have been enough for khris middleton
What a crazy close game. Giannis needs to hit those free throws.  Khris Middleton is a bad man!
#KHRIS ‚ÄúKOBE BRYANT‚Äù MIDDLETON
Khris Middleton. wow. Amazing game
Is Khris Middleton better than jimmy butler?
"Khris Middleton gives me ‚ÄúNOT THIS GUY‚Äù feels every time he has the ball in crunch time. GG Bucks, hard fought game one."
Khris Middleton is the clutchest player in the league
I don't wanna hear one more word of disrespect towards khris fucking middleton ever again. Fuck.
khris middleton the god for letting us watch this game
"The Heat are going to make the Bucks work in this series if they want to avenge last year's elimination as they narrowly pulled this one out on a clutch game winner from Khris Middleton, but I have to say -- it's honestly inexcusable for Giannis to still be this poor of a free throw shooter at this point in his career."
"If you thought Khris Middleton was going to pass that ball, I've got a bridge to sell you"
Khris ‚ÄúKobe‚Äù Middleton
KHRIS KASH FUCKING MIDDLETON
Khris Middleton chose death by midrange.
KHRIS MIDDLETON
"Possible hot take, but Khris Middleton may be more valuable to Mil than Giannis is."
He did it!! Khris Middleton!!!
Khris Middleton is so smooth I‚Äôm gonna cream
OK KHRIS MIDDLETON
Khris Middleton looks like my sleep paralysis demon
Khris Middleton is one of the most clutch players in NBA history
Wow! Khris Middleton did that.
Khris fuckin Middleton
KHRIS FUCKING MIDDLETON
God damn I know he can't help it but khris Middleton is a weird looking dude
Fuck Khris Middleton
I view khris middleton like today‚Äôs mo williams or jameer nelson. An ‚Äúall star‚Äù only cuz of the superstar on his team. And second best on team by a long shot lol
What a disgusting act by Khris Middleton.
Some rapper‚Äôs gotta say they‚Äôve got drip like Khris Middleton cuz that man SWEATS
Khris Middleton is a PROBLEM idc what anyone says hes a 3 level scorer at an efficient rate with elite passing thats an ALL STAR  He scares me way more than Giannis ever will
Bobby Portis and Khris Middleton carrying the Bucks hard rn. Lot of ISO touch‚Äôs for them so far
Khris Middleton seems pretty fair and should improve both teams if the bucks flare out this postseason
"Right... while he's good not sure if it's worth giving the future away when I don't think that will shift things for us that much. Needs to be a true top tier or like a Khris Middleton type wing I think (great perimeter defense, high bbiq, good shooting). Otherwise we probably end up a middle seed with zero assets once the core ages out"
khris middleton üôèüôèüôè
Lol what khris Middleton would like a word
"I just don't get excited about Jamal.  Not that I don't think he's really good, it's just that he's very...Khris Middleton to me. He's a phenomenal complementary player, but he will never (in my opinion) move to that next tier where we're putting him on an MVP ballot, or he makes 1st Team All-NBA, or you're talking about building a contender around him.  MPJ feels like he could eventually win a scoring title.  He feels like he could have a 75 point game. He feels like he could be an incredibly high-usage player that defines an offense. Now, maybe I'm wrong about his ceiling. Maybe I'm wrong about Jamal's ceiling, but that's just my perception."
I pray that the Celtics find somewhere else to send Tristan Thompson this offseason.  He killed the Celtics when he played for the Cavs and now he kills the Celtics while he's playing for the Celtics.  Dude is so good at killing the Celtics you'd think he's Khris Middleton or some shit
"They absolutely did not have the Lakers on the brink lol. Butler had an all-time game to take that series as long as it went, but there was nothing left in the tank after that. And anyone who makes that Milwaukee team out to be super talented is smoking crack. You really think Brook Lopez and Khris Middleton are that high quality of running mates? Hell Bledsoe was actively a liability."
The Nets only really treated Khris Middleton like a floor spacer and just helped off everybody else including PJ and Jrue. Was a big part of why they flustered the Bucks offense at times and didnt make Giannis's life super easy
"Artificial parity only in the form of injuries, who tf wants to watch a Lou Williams vs Khris Middleton ECF?"
You're not amped up to see Khris Middleton vs Lou Williams?
"ya, I was gonna say. 6'7"" long and athletic khris middleton 10 feet away from the hoop guarded by a shorter, slower kevin huerter who has obviously never defended anyone in the post is a good proposition  posting up a random center against another random center is mostly a bad proposition. even the best-best post scorers still struggle to generate points as efficiently as a you get from decent 3pt shooters. it's just really hard to score in ISO situations.   what teams could do, and maybe should do, is run more motion and take advantage of cutters or mismatches, so if you have a good post scorer you can get them in great positions to score, so it's not just them backing down another 7 footer and trying to get a jump hook"
"You don't get what you deserve, you get what you can leverage   See: Harris, Tobias and Middleton, Khris  Collins getting maxed"
"The 2019 world cup roster:  Derrick White, Donovan Mitchell, Joe Harris, Marcus Smart, Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Mason Plumlee, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Kemba Walker"

khris middleton is a bucket
"It feels like people forgot Portis was literally a starter level player, Jrue Holiday is an All-NBA worthy starting guard, Khris Middleton is an All-Star caliber forward, and Brook Lopez is still capable of playing at an elite level, if anything improving his defence since he was an All-NBA post player"
"What are you talking about? This was absolutely without a doubt, one of the basketball games we've seen this playoffs.  Jokes aside, Trae Young is much more integral to Hawks' offense than Giannis is to the Bucks' and it showed. Not sure how the Hawks can bring this back. Even when Brook Lopez and Bobby Portis Jr aren't popping off, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday are much more consistent scorings options than anyone on this Hawks team. I just don't see a good answer from the Hawks to the Bucks dominance in the paint either."
"A better question would've been *""How has Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton showed their leadership in the absence of Giannis?""*"
Bucks are real contenders when Khris Middleton isn't shooting and passing like Stevie Wonder and Giannis is healthy
"It was really awful. I was playing a game of pickup with my bro, and it was going great till I went up to block a shot, and out of nowhere Khris Middleton came flying and landed right on my ankles. The doctors had to amputate."
Khris Middleton gets a +15 to all stats at the Fiserv Forum. This shoulda been expected tbh
Fmvp khris middleton

What is the song that plays whenever Khris Middleton makes a shot??
"Khris Middleton has gotten that flagrant one foul call so many times in this post season, it's not even a surprise they gave it to him at this point."

Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton combined have the dumbest shot selection in the league

So lou is atlanta's khris middleton?
The East Finals really gonna be decided by Khris Middleton and Kevin Huerter.
Idk I‚Äôm pretty excited for the star battle between Khris Middleton and Danilo Gallinari
John Collins vs Khris Middleton was not the ECF matchup Adam silver was hoping for I'm guessing
"He's khris Middleton esque. Probably too good to be a 3rd option, but not good enough to be a consistent 2nd option."
"It's funny because your fake ""wrong"" answer might actually be right. I've seen enough of khris middleton &amp; playoff jrue to be pretty weary about their leadership going into this game. It's gonna be huge for both of them, and I hope they step up, but I wouldn't be shocked if we saw more of what happened  over the last 20 or so minutes of G4."
John Collins was strong enough that Khris Middleton couldnt create space for his jumper. He was short a ton when cam wasnt on the floor too.
"Bucks have a chance if they win tonight, but I think the Hawks got it. Middleton + Jrue I don't think is enough to topple a hot Hawks team that has Trae coming back, unless Khris starts seeing red as green and birds as leprechauns."
"Trae can go off, as well as all the other shooters on that squad. Ayton gets in fol trouble early with Giannis and we're in trouble. Khris Middleton goes for 36 and can't miss again for a quarter, etc. Lots of ways to lose it."
"If Lebron and the lakers couldn‚Äôt be the Suns, Khris Middleton and the bucks sure as hell ain‚Äôt."
Controversial statement: LeBron is better than Khris Middleton.
something ab danny ainge infuriates khris middleton‚Ä¶ maybe it‚Äôs the racism lmao

Unless Khris is playing the Celtics. Then its  &gt;idk what nephew takes you‚Äôve been reading but in no world is Michael Jordan better than Khris Middleton lol
Just wait until CP3 wins finals mvp averaging 15/8 in a 4 game sweep over Khris Middleton. There will be nephews debating it
idk what nephew takes you‚Äôve been reading but in no world is khris middleton better than paul george lol
"He‚Äôs the WC Khris Middleton.  Can be a #1 for a game or two, but not a series.  Solid #2 dude."
Khris Middleton will be a major factor but I think it‚Äôs worrisome for the Bucks that Cam Reddish is back now because he has the ability to keep Middleton‚Äôs offense in check. The Hawks‚Äô biggest weakness this postseason has been perimeter defense and Reddish being back in the mix is a huge boost for them.
Khris Middleton #2?
John Collins and Khris Middleton headlining the ECFs LOL
Lmao John Collins vs. Khris Middleton
Trust me I know all about Reggie I used to see him when they came to the hotel before games in MKE. It‚Äôs just that Khris Middleton and Jrue are max players and they aren‚Äôt performing even up to half of the worth of those contracts
The fact that Reggie Jackson is outperforming Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday these playoffs makes my blood boil lol
Book is not khris middleton loool
Okay to be specific make Khris Middleton the first option and make the plays revolve around him and Jrue. Jrue is a good defender I believe but if he has a great game and so does the rest of the team we could win.
Ok the adjustment is ‚ÄúKhris Middleton and the rest of the team get more shots‚Äù
I believe in Khris Middleton and the rest of the team.
Lets say bucks will their way to the finals without Giannis. Jae Crowder clamps Khris Middleton and gets the FMVP . That would be wild as hell
"Giannis still having his tendons has got me (probably wrongfully) confident again, soooo: Khris Middleton"
Khris Middleton usually plays well at home and ass on the road. Games 1 and 3 cancelled out for him this series though
"Khris Middleton is unbelievably overrated. He's probably the worst second option ""star"" in the NBA. It's amazing how poorly he shoots on a regular basis next to the 2x MVP"
Khris middleton is cool too cuz he‚Äôs so unatheletic  looking but will hit jump shots over ur favorite player
Get two lottery picks for Middleton?    I love Khris but you‚Äôd be stupid not to take that deal.
I probably won‚Äôt.   If you find Khris Middleton vs Clint Capela appealing to watch then be my guest.
"Ok, but giannis wouldn‚Äôt be unrivaled at all. Lots of guys are just as good if not better. Also Khris Middleton is playing better these playoffs than mchale ever did.   This all obviously ignores the glaringly obvious conclusion that the only reason the bucks are even in the ecf is due to lucky injuries."
Nobody gives a shit about Kevin Huerter and Khris Middleton. They want to watch Trae and Giannis.
everyone wants to see john collins vs khris middleton
So who‚Äôs the Hawks best player right now?  There‚Äôs a good chance Game 5 will be headlined by Khris Middleton and John Collins. That‚Äôs sad.
If he didn‚Äôt get a better handle he‚Äôd be a taller Khris Middleton with Jokic‚Äôs vision. Definitely top 5 in the league.
"I dunno, we're due for a Khris Middleton super game where he drops like 6 3pters and scores 40.  This series should go 7, it seems to wildly swing back and forth and now with the superstars on both teams hobbled or out, the inconsistent role players will have to step up and that's a tall order"
Joe has won more playoff games on his own than Khris Middleton has participated in
"Yeah, I bet Bucks fans would love for Khris Middleton to be that inconsistent"
Khris Middleton played exactly like he always does: inconsistently.
"if its an ACL it wont matter.  Jrue and Khris will have to lead the bucks to whatever their fate may be. I wouldnt expect a top 6 seed given how the east has improved over the last few seasons.   Having said all that, Bud IS a regular season coach. So if they do keep him on, they could over achieve in the regular season (again).   Ultimately, if giannis out, this could be a big opportunity for Middleton to make some sort of step regarding his consistency. He will have to be the #1 option, and Jrue will also need to step up. If that happens, a healthy Giannis being added could leave a viable title window upon his return, but it would be a very tight window, as Jrue is CURRENTLY 31. Not to mention Brooks age, PJ tucker would likely get moved to a contender for future assets.   As far as coaching goes, I could see Bud getting a 2 year extension. This keeps him on while Giannis is out (assuming ACL), and lets him run it back one more time with a healthy giannis. (most bucks fans would hate to see this, we want him gone.)  Its a tough call to make though, because what do you gain by bringing in a new coach while your #1 Option, 2X MVP, wont even be suiting up to play for him for another season?"
&gt; This organization looks for why excuse possible to tolerate mediocrity.  *Looks at Khris Middleton getting max money*  That's a good start point to validate the mediocrity.
"hawks had literally everyone step up and play so well i‚Äôm not 100% sold that we win this series even if giannis is out. law of averages catches up. khris middleton went uncharacteristically off in the fourth quarter in game 3 and literally could not miss and then this game kinda cancelled it out  i think this game highlights how big that rondo trade was for us. rondo is just not built to run this kind of offense imo and lou, while obviously not trae, has at least some of the same skills  i really don‚Äôt know what the bucks were doing this game. not only did they just run some terrible plays before and after giannis went down, they were missing good looks. bud will rightfully be blamed for his team being underprepared but jrue, khris and bobby giving you 3/19 from 3 is so bad"
yeah ultimately it doesn‚Äôt matter if bucks have giannis or not if khris middleton is that bad for the rest of the series
Budenholzer has to go and if Khris Middleton keeps averaging 15ppg hes gotta be moved too
it's a coin toss on wether Khris Middleton is actually going to scorch.
"All those legends, people actually wanted to see them take all the shots/make the team as a token selection  Nobody wants to hear Marv Albert call PJ Tucker as Khris fucking Middleton"
"If Trae doesn't come back or the Hawks lose:  FMVP might be Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday, Devin Booker, Chris Paul, Deandre Ayton, Paul George.  Never would have expected those candidates, George is the best player there but we never thought he had a chance at it due to Kawhi being there and now gone."
"the mavs had a future hall of famer going apeshit for 40 minutes a night.  if the suns beat the clips, the literal best possible player they could face is khris middleton.  **khris middleton.**"
like a khris middleton/gordon hayward/tobias harris? his off the dribble shot creation is very good for his age.
"Khris Middleton and Khrisis Middleton, the duality of man."
&gt;It‚Äôs abundantly clear Jrue and Khris left their games in Milwaukee  Wouldn‚Äôt the Bucks be down 3-1 right now if it wasn‚Äôt for Middleton single handedly carrying the Bucks in Atlanta in game 3 or is my memory that terrible?
"Hate to say it but Jrue is 31, Khris turns 30 in a month. They have no picks after next year. They have one year basically to restock the shelves. Honestly should consider trading those two next year. Denver wouldn‚Äôt do it but a Jamal Murray trade might make sense for both teams. Gordon/Murray and other salary for Middleton and Holiday. Bucks tank a year and hope to get two guys back healthy. Nuggets probably become title favorites. I‚Äôll probably get downvoted for that though"
"It gave the whole goddamn team superpowers.   K'Von and Capela both scored more than Giannis (yes, yes I know about the injury), and only one less than Khris 'played 36 minutes' Middleton.   Lou Will and Bogi both scored more than Jrue."
"Khris Middleton is that number 2, problem is they went from Malcolm Brogdon to George Hill to Teague as their backup guard. They need a playmaker off the bench."
"Honestly I think we will get the biggest Finals MVP snub of all time as Khris Middleton gets it in a valiant losing effort for the Bucks because even if PG13 averages 50/15/10/10/9.9 on 80% TS, the media will say that he should have been getting more steals to slow down Khris Middleton."
"I think you‚Äôre the one screaming here.  I have no dog in this race.  I really don‚Äôt care about Atlanta.  Just want PHX and the clippers to lose.  Facts are game 1 you barely scrapped by with a GOAT level game from Trae, game 2 you got deleted, Game 3 Khris Middleton singlehandedly beat you down in the 4th, and game 4 we will never know because Giannis going down killed the bucks."
Khris Middleton  Jrue Holiday  Bud
bro khris middleton is fine he is just overrated. i didn‚Äôt take any shots at giannis lmfao  mad ass weirdo
"Thing is, we come out after Middleton has a great game and say ""stop the Khris hate!"" But let's face it, he's mad inconsistent. One great game usually means the next one's a stinker. I love the guy, but it's the truth."
"I was on a nice stroll this evening, when all the sudden a brick landed on my head. I forgot to check the forecast, but apparently Khris Middleton made it rain bricks from 3 tonight"
"I was on a nice stroll this evening, when all the sudden a brick landed on my head. I forgot to check the forecast, but apparently Khris Middleton made it rain bricks from 3 tonight üß±üß±üß±üß±"
thats the Khris Middleton I know. 0/7 from 3
Paul George and Khris Middleton are the only all stars left that haven't gotten injured I think. Hope they can survive.
How is Khris Middleton looking like a scrub one day and prime Steph Curry the next day?
Shooting a combined 12/34 (2/7 from three for Holiday and 0/7 for Middleton) with 8 turnovers -- it's abundantly clear that Jrue and Khris left their games in Milwaukee.
"Oh, the Bucks got THAT Khris Middleton today."
Khris Middleton with that cool team worst -22.

"Khris Middleton is a top tier bucket getter in the league. Dude can get so unbelievably hot, and he has so many moves. It's honestly fun to watch when he's not killing your team"
khris middleton literally plays like mj or anthony bennett. Theres no in between

Khris Kyle kuzma Middleton tonighg
"Oh no, is the shitty Khris Middleton here again?"
Also the fact we could trade for him and keep Middleton.  To trade for CP3 we likely would have had to trade both Khris and Brook.
"Booker was the more efficient scorer and more of a threat as a scorer but that‚Äôs the thing, Booker doesn‚Äôt do much other than scoring. On the other hand, Middleton is pretty much the Bucks‚Äô floor general on offense when Holiday is struggling, Khris scored 40 points while doing all that"
"No they weren‚Äôt lol. That foul on Khris Middleton where Jae shot a 3 was hand contact, nothing else and it was after the release. That‚Äôs completely legal. Jae even jumped forward into him trying to draw.   The other one might‚Äôve been a foul but he was barely touched on the face and went down like he got poked in the eye.   Also the one where dude tried getting play stopped cause he turned the ball over and claimed he hurt his ankle.. then got right back up and started running. They were flopping hard. CP3 team"
"I'm not gay but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with Khris Middleton. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he dummies the Suns, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Khash Money. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love. Bucks in 6."
??? Khris Middleton is not starting lmao. He's going to be fresh off an insane playoff run with very little legs left and not familiar with the team. Plus Booker and Tatum are far better starting options.  If Middleton was a lockdown defender that's one thing but that's an insane presumption.
"70% James Harden? Why are you lying, Harden was nowhere near 70% lol, Joe Harris was literally terrible in the playoffs and had a 46TS% vs the Bucks, shooting 34% from three. Blake was good but still Giannis had Khris Middleton and All NBA defender Jrue Holiday, it was nowhere near 'just Giannis'"
"Khris Middleton: Pistons, Bucks, Celtics   /s"
"Giannis had Khris Middleton and an All NBA defender in Jrue, he def had more help than KD and wasn't 'just' Giannis"
"On offense Jrue is actually not doing much (killing it on D though) while Middleton only shows up 1/3 games but goes supernova when he shows up. Giannis shows up every second of every game. It‚Äôs not that Jrue or Khris are bad, but their consistency is very lacking."
Even Khris Middleton was drawing double teams against the Hawks in Game 6 after he scored 23 in the 3rd quarter. Many great shooters get doubled.
Away vs home Khris middleton could be a problem too.
"CJ was the main reason we beat the Nuggets in round 2, two years ago. His late game mid-range talent is like Khris Middleton. He can actually play playoff basketball unlike Simmons who can't do ANYTHING in the final 5 minutes of a game. We don't want him as our best player."
"&gt; Middleton, a g league player  He was in the G League for 1 week during his rookie season  - don't be calling Khris ""a g league player"" like dude was toiling down there for years and finally caught his ""big break"" or some shit lmao"
"Offense &gt;defense. Curry/Harden as offensive players are so dominant that it overtakes the gap in defense.   The Suns defense isnt really dominant. They are good but not great.  Even when they faced Brooklyn the, Bucks offensive Rating was terrible. Thats also in part because the Nets offense were dominant in the half court so the Bucks had less half court opportunities.   I disagree, I think if you are dominant offensively it offsets the gap in defense. Offense will always be more important. its why you see that Khris Middleton is very important for the Bucks(not more important than Giannis of course but he's getting the ball a lot in the 4th).  KD and Harden are MUCH better than him on offense. KD almost beat Giannis and the Bucks by himself(gimpy Harden) with a much worse roster."
"Lol, I feel like this is Khris Middleton slander."
"When Ray Allen and Michael Redd both played together, it was Redd who was designed to take final shot. Redd is the best shooter to ever play for Milwaukee. But Redd couldn‚Äôt guard a traffic cone and Middleton is a much better play maker and rebounder, so give me Khris and his well rounded game."
"I love Jaylen Brown the person and player, but man, he is overrated amongst Celtics fans.   He is much closer to being the next Khris Middleton than the next Kawhi Leonard.   I swear a lot of our fans don't really want to win a championship. Making 2 ECFs isn't some guarantee of future success like our fans seem to think it is."
"Giannis, khris Middleton, jrue holiday, brook lopez"
"He‚Äôs not a ‚Äúwinner‚Äù more than most top 30 players lmao, he‚Äôs made the **playoffs** 0 times in his career without an MVP candidate on his team. He‚Äôs much closer to Jamal Murray and Khris Middleton than he is to any actual top 10 players"
"I, the person you responded to, believed that Khris Middleton, the NBA player who plays for the Milwaukee Bucks, was only around 6‚Äô3"
"He is but unlike alot of others, although it's changing with the advent of Curry leading to Luka/Trae, they look to make the best PLAY, period. But when Bron wants to take over and score he can, I mean Khris Middleton just tied him in clutch time FGs, and he's had arguably the greatest playoffs runs ever in either 2014, 2016 or 2018, take your pick on whether sheer dominance (although Shaq 2k is probably better, and some Jordan runs), a chip or team performance matters most."
"Michael Redd was a legend, but the thing Redd is most known for Middleton does better  Michael Redd shooting splits: 45/38/83  Khris Middleton shooting splits: 46/39/88  Middleton leads Redd in assists/rebounding/defense  Edit: Although Redd did have a couple of years shooting the 3 when he shot &gt;43.8% from 3 on more than 5 attempts. That's wild and something Middleton has never touched"
"Please don't be a delusional Dubs fan spouting superlatives like this...  I'd take KD, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, OG Anunuby, Khris Middleton and Jaylen Brown immediately, as well as a healthy Kawhi and Lebron, but it's unlikely any of them are available. I'd also highly consider Nic Batum, Tobias Harris, Micheal Porter, and Harry Barnes  Wiggs is good enough and important to fill a specific role on the GSW, and he's vital to holding on to that max salary slot for trade purposes.  But he'll always be an overpaid #1 pick with significant limitations. The lack of ball handling and passing vision/BBIQ, poor FT shooting, poor rebounding, and generally bad shot selection all contribute to being an average player who has always been net-negative by BPM, RPM, RAPTOR, etc."
"With all due respect, the only guy I wouldn‚Äôt take lavine over in a vacuum are Khris Middleton and Jerami Grant. But on this team, those guys could serve a defensive purpose. Beal doesn‚Äôt matter anymore anyway tho so Lavine might be more needed than before"
Yeah..because he plays with Giannis and Jrue. In the 24 games Giannis has missed over the past 3 years Khris averages 25 PPG..but the fact of that matter is if you have more then 1 or 2 stars on your team...everyone is bound to lose shots. James Harden only put up more than 15 shots in fourteen games total with Brooklyn.   Also sidenote: But regular season Khris Middleton isn't nearly as inconsistent as playoff Middleton.
"Without Giannis, is khris able to carry the team?  The teams redd played for were absolutely garbage and Middleton would have done no better than him if he were the sole star playing for them.  Khris, who I named dog after, which should tell you how fond of him I am, does not and has never had (maybe his first year with the team) the responsibility that redd had as the only all star level threat on a team.  Honestly, I think the two are very comparable, I just think that people are underrating redd!"
"Smh y‚Äôall need to put respek on mike redd he was nice, had way more of an edge than middleton, more consistent never afraid to pull the trigger, unfortunately injuries robbed him. No disrespect to khris I watched them both play redd was just that good."
"Suns, I don‚Äôt like Book at all but love CP3, although I do kinda like Khris Middleton and Jrue, so I wouldn‚Äôt mind them winning and CP3 going down as G-COAT, but I don‚Äôt want to see Giannis win."
The ‚ÄúIs Khris Middleton more clutch than Kobe‚Äù post from today that was promptly deleted was quite honestly one of the dumbest things I‚Äôve ever read on this app
who‚Äôs khris Middleton? I thought the suns are up against a prime MJ (again)
"Personally, I'm not investing money into like a Trae Young jersey even though I absolutely love him. I only have a Giannis jersey and a Khris Middleton FIBA Jersey"
"When Middleton went 8 for 25 in an elimination last year his stock was not exactly soaring. I remember him being a talking point that miami would not make the finals with him as the second best player. I do agree Middleton is having an amazing playoff run, like legendary. If Bucks win it is not gonna be the first Giannis and the rest ring, it is gonna be the first Giannis and Khris and the rest ring.  These recency bias takes are something else. (shout out to HOF Cam Payne)"
Bro they have jrue holiday and khris Middleton coming in. Those 2 will be core part of the rotation and are some of the best defenders in the league
"cause booker is still perceived as a young star on the rise, while middleton is perceived as a guy who's much better in regular season than in playoffs where he bombed a number of times. also booker is flashier. khris is a better player, but he's so infuriating to watch sometimes."
Pistons legend Khris Middleton
"&gt;Hes their only shooter besides Middleton  This hurts man, we were like the 2nd or 3rd best shooting team in the league in the RS with Donte, Brook, Khris, Jrue, Bryn, Bobby, and Pat knocking down 3s.  Now all we have are Khris and Pat, with Brook occasionally catching on fire"

"Khris ""Jungian"" Middleton"
How many championships does Khris Middleton have? Please put a satire notification on this post‚Ä¶
Khris Middleton has a good game and you comparing him to Kobe?
"well, what determines 'when it matters' to you? it's the playoffs..... i was under the impression that every game matters. dude is maybe *the* most consistently inconsistent player in the league, so it makes no sense to take his hot streaks (which are certainly very hot) and then act like they're more important than his cold streaks (which are equally cold).   it's not even like 'oh it's about elimination games' cause most of these aren't that lmao. why is game 5 of the hawks series (bucks win to go up 3-2) more relevant than game 4, where the bucks could have gone up 3-1 if middleton hadn't dropped a sizzling 16 points on 17 shots, 35.3/0/100 splits. game 2 vs the suns... 11 points on 16 shots. why dig yourself out of a hole when you could just... not dig yourself into one?  if he didn't randomly play like ass every third game, it wouldn't be notable that he 'steps it up when it matters', so i don't really understand the reasoning behind this thread or the tweet at all lol. and to be clear i don't hate khris middleton whatsoever, i have no strong feelings about him at all besides thinking that he doesn't quite look like he's from our solar system, but this post is an example of the most annoying kind of narrative cherrypicking  shout to to sam cassell who i think is also from khris's home planet"
Simmons. Khris Middleton getting hot for a finals game isn‚Äôt going to change the opinion I have had since the regular season ended.
"Ben ‚ÄúI'm to much of a pussy to take a layup‚Äù Simmons is no longer a top 30 player, and on any playoff hopeful let alone contender becomes an utter liability to the point it's not even funny.       Khris Middleton has always been and will stay better than Ben Simmons"
"In case you are pay walled:  #Thwaaap! Giannis Blocks a Shot‚Äîand Milwaukee and Phoenix Have a Series A brilliant defensive play by the two-time MVP prevents a dunk, and NBA Finals are thrillingly deadlocked  The NBA Finals between Milwaukee and Phoenix are knotted 2-2 after Milwaukee‚Äôs impressive 109-103 come-from-behind win Wednesday. A few quick thoughts:  This is a refreshing reboot. The Bucks haven‚Äôt won a Finals since 1971. The Suns have never won a Finals. While I enjoy watching pinnacle talents like LeBron James and Kevin Durant stack their championship r√©sum√©s, seeing all these new faces on the league‚Äôs biggest stage is energizing. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton, Devin Booker, DeAndre Ayton, future Hall of Fame point guard Chris Paul‚Äîthese Finals are full of first-timers with an opportunity for career-defining moments, and we‚Äôre getting a bunch of them so far.  Fresh energy is always good. The NBA built itself on starcraft and iconography‚Äîelevating names like Magic, Bird, Jordan, James, KD and Curry, but the hazard comes when the biggest stars are eliminated or injured, and the assumption is that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúdown‚Äù year for the sport. Not always. This series shows it.   Giannis! The low-key Middleton deserves credit for bailing out the Bucks with 40 points in Game 4, but this series has been an indelible showcase for Antetokounmpo, a two-time MVP who still contends with a low frequency of grumbling that he‚Äôs not among the NBA‚Äôs peak elite. Bah: Giannis is incredible, and he‚Äôs only getting better. Antetokounmpo seemed lost for the season when he injured his knee in the Eastern Conference finals; versus Phoenix, he‚Äôs playing with characteristic relentlessness, averaging 32.2 points and 14 rebounds, and appears locked in on the chance to get Milwaukee its first title since Kareem and the Big O delivered one.  Giannis‚Äôs signature Finals moment may prove to be a spectacular defensive one: with barely a minute left in Wednesday‚Äôs game, he leapt from somewhere on the outskirts of Sheboygan to block a game-tying alley-oop dunk by an airborne Ayton. Watch it again if you can, it‚Äôs astonishing: Antetokounmpo is thoroughly beaten on the play, spun in a pick and roll, and has a foot near the free-throw line when Booker lofts the oop skyward, and yet Antetokounmpo somehow manages to track back, turn his body completely in the other direction, and leap for a perfectly clean swat above the rim of a 7-foot-1 center.   Who does such things? Basically, comic book characters, and Giannis.    Meanwhile, Middleton has been quietly essential for the whole Milwaukee run, including those two Giannis-less victories over Atlanta to get here, and dumping 38 in a crucial Game 6 victory over Brooklyn when the Bucks looked like toast. In the 29-year-old second-rounder, the Bucks have a co-headliner whose fluid, clutch scoring perfectly complements Giannis‚Äôs blunt power‚Äîthese stars may be dissimilar, but that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre such a potent 1-2.   Focus on Giannis, and Middleton burns you. Switch it up, and get more of the same. The Bucks can maddeningly complicate things for themselves, but it really may be that simple.   As for Phoenix, they remain very much in this series. (it‚Äôs tied, for crying out loud!) The Suns got some early excellence from the veteran Paul (32 points in Game 1) as they raced to a 2-0 series lead, their rotation has more depth than Milwaukee‚Äôs, and they had a clear chance to jump to a 3-1 lead Wednesday. In Game 4, Booker had the thrilling, pour-it-on ‚ÄúBooker game‚Äù everyone had been waiting for, with 42 points‚Äîthough playing with five fouls in the fourth quarter, Booker also got a miraculous reprieve from officials who missed a double-armed intentional tackling foul he made on Milwaukee‚Äôs Jrue Holiday.  The NBA is a sport in which they‚Äôre now halting games for dull, FBI-style forensics on fingertip out-of-bounds plays, and they somehow didn‚Äôt see the equivalent of a QB sack.  There‚Äôs no asterisk to this title. There‚Äôs been a persistent muttering that this title will be somehow diminished because Phoenix got past some banged-up teams (the Lakers without Anthony Davis, Denver without Jamal Murray, the Clippers deprived of Kawhi Leonard) and Milwaukee barely escaped an East without a fully loaded Nets team. Please. The path to any championship is always paved with opportunism and moments of fortune, and great teams capitalize. If anything, I‚Äôd take the other side of the argument: winning a championship this season, which arrived fast on the heels of the ‚Äúbubble tournament‚Äù in Orlando and began with empty stadiums due to Covid-19, is an even more striking accomplishment. No asterisks for the ‚Äúbubble title,‚Äù or this one. Come on. Don‚Äôt be absurd.   I have no idea what‚Äôs going to happen here, and that‚Äôs great. Some truth in the fine print: Game 4 was the first really competitive, down-to-the-wire game of this series. As the series shifts to Game 5 in Phoenix on Saturday‚Äîthanks, basketball, for the extended delay, maybe I‚Äôll go off to culinary school and get a degree in the interim‚Äîit‚Äôs hard to get a read on where it‚Äôs going. Phoenix‚Äôs championship-starved crowd is at full tilt. Milwaukee‚Äôs championship-starved crowd is at full tilt. You could argue the Bucks have momentum, but the home teams have held thus far.   Do you have a sense that one opponent has unlocked the other? I don‚Äôt, and that‚Äôs the exciting thing. There‚Äôs nothing duller than a Final with a vibe of inevitability, and there‚Äôs none here. We truly don‚Äôt know for sure who‚Äôs going to win it, and that‚Äôs the best possible sell. That, and Giannis. He‚Äôs really something else."
Known fourth option Khris Middleton
I was a Bojan over Middleton guy not because I thought Bojan would replace his value but because I was nervous about filling our payroll up before we were really sure we had a championship duo. I was happily and completely proven wrong in 2019 and it's probably become the worst opinion I've ever had. I adore Khris and I couldn't imagine doing this without him.
"And it's not like the Bucks have been without criticism. There have been so many posts about how we should fire Bud, playoff Jrue = playoff Bledsoe, Khris Middleton is not a championship level 2nd option, Giannis has no skill and just elbows guys in the chest to then take nap at the FT line... or the Barkley statement that everybody latched onto, ""the Bucks are the dumbest team of all time""  That's just what happens when there are only 2 teams left standing out of 30 and people want to pick sides. The Warriors were both hugely popular and unpopular in their title runs; it's nothing new this time. I agree it sucks and is why I'm not really a fan of the ""rings or bust"" attitudes towards players/teams. The Bucks were honestly way more fun to watch a few years ago when there wasn't this added pressure from expectations to win, and instead we just got to watch Giannis go for crazy highlights every night."
"I usually dont care about the looks of other guys, but Khris Middleton is so fucking ugly it‚Äòs hard to not care and if that is a upgrade over that dudes face‚Ä¶ ü§¢"
"As a heat fan the past two years I have had nightmares caused by Khris ‚ÄúMichael Jordan‚Äù Middleton. It got to the point that I‚Äôd rather have Giannis have the ball than Middleton.   Every time the bucks hit a big shot, who else but Khris Middleton. Sometimes he goes 6/23 but sometimes the power of god flows through him with the intensity of a thousand suns."
Khris Middleton
"Ah yes, I remember when everyone was wondering why Khris Middleton was a starter two years ago..... when he was an All Star averaging 20/5/4 on 44/38/84 shooting for the season.  How to tell us you never watched the Bucks play before these playoffs, without saying you never watched the Bucks play before these playoffs."
Not rigged like Silver told the officials not to foul out Booker.  But it's an egregious foul call that shows the refs feel they are expected to swallow the whistle for certain stars.  The NBA should really be thanking Khris Middleton because if the Suns had won that game the entire storyline would have been that foul.
"CJ is too small to defend anyone adequately but point guards, Khris has prototypical nba wing size and can switch reliably so it helps the defense a TON.  Middleton is also a better finisher, has a more varied offensive game, and I think is a better playmaker."
"Who do they get, better than Middleton, that buys into the city and team like Khris?"
"Giannis may not be able to get the clutch shots that Khris can get, but those plays on defense are equally as clutch. When Middleton does show up, the two compliments each other so well."
That‚Äôs NBA Champion Khris Middleton btw
I feel like Khris Middleton would be up there. He did really well in the playoffs. As well as Booker. I'm not sure if Dros would be up there. You never know
I want to know what he said when Khris Middleton got drafted just ahead of him
"Not a chance, they're both similar in terms of skill (AD the better shooter) but Giannis is much more of a leader and is way more durable than day-to-davis. Curious to see how AD would've fared with a Khris Middleton type player in 17-18 and Jrue Holiday"
So Tatum is the Spurs' Khris Middleton? Would be interesting to see a chart of the players that go off the most against other teams.
This is as idiotic as the Khris Middleton is the batman take  Sure he closes but Giannis is still the main guy  Jrue Holiday did the exact same thing for the Bucks this year he clamped up CP3 in games 3 and 4 and Booker in game 6 where's the love for him?
"You're a literal idiot if you're bringing up NBA stats in relation to his olympic performance. Carmelo was the best basketball Olympian of all time. Better than Lebron / Kobe. NBA greatness doesn't translate to Olympic greatness on a 1 to 1 scale.   Tatum is great in the NBA. However his game is built on being the star. If he takes another step and by 2024 is a top 5 player in the NBA, then he may assume Durant's role. As it stands, he's not a good fit and is not the lead man of the time. He's not playing good off ball and his defense is lacking for what's being asked.   It's like if you swapped him and khris middleton in real life, the bucks get marginally worse, but the celtics get way worse. Khris isn't necessarily the better overall player, but the fit is better.   Your stupid line of thinking is why the US has lost 3 games in the past month. Can't understand that basketball is not a game of father the best players and beat them running pickup. You have to have a good fit."
I don't get that some users call Khris Middleton Kate unironically
"The Bucks are the second closest to a superteam. They literally have Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton to play with Giannis, plus more defensive support from PJ and Lopez. Other superstars like Dame, Luka and Harden would have loved to play with players like that. They‚Äôre better than the 2019 Raptors. A real championship team are the 2011 Mavs or the 2015 Warriors."
Like even if the Bucks are having a bad shooting night you still don‚Äôt want to leave Khris Middleton or Pat Connaughton wide open unlike guys like Russ
"Oh, I'm not trying to say that at all, I'm saying that Clippers squad without Kawhi was better than the Lakers without AD. Although I think a healthy Clippers squad would have been harder to beat than a healthy Lakers squad last year.  I can see the point with Ayton, I dont know that the Suns will ask him to be much more than he is right now while Paul is still there and giving him the max still scares me. But he does provide more offense than Gobert so he can't be exactly played off the court with a small ball lineup because he can punish them on the glass and as a rim roller.  I'm just higher on Mikal Bridges than you are. Maybe that's being a homer but 3 &amp; D players are still extremely valuable in the NBA today and if he doesnt improve at all, Bridges will still be a really good 3 &amp; D player. He has a developing mid range game and has been better at attacking closeouts so I think he can get to a Khris Middleton level which I think teams would gladly take at $25M a year (I'm not sure I see him getting $25M a year on this contract, that seems on the high end, but somewhere between 20-25 million yes, and I think he's worth it)."
"Say what you want about Khris Middleton, but Guilty Gear Strive is a dope ass game."
"Just play the starters plus khris Middleton and draymond green, Lavine. Tatum is being absolute trash"
NBA CHAMPION KHRIS MIDDLETON WITH THE GOODS
"No, he's a 6'9 PF. But honestly he did play like the bigman version of Khris Middleton this past season, he's just so so so much slower I struggle to see him scoring like that and being able to do anything with the ball in the league."
"Off the top of your comment, is Khris Middleton a good future comparison?"
Khris Middleton over bridges
"Jokic, Luka, Jamal Murray, Steph, Klay, PG13, Kahwi, LeBron, AD, Ja Morant, CP3, Booker, DeAaron Fox,  Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Trae, Tatum, KD, Harden, Kyrie, LaMelo, Bam, Giannis, Holiday, Khris Middleton, Embiid, Lowry, Beal are all better"
"Not sure many people have Jimmy Butler alongside Lillard and Embiid right now.  Curry + Durant on the same level as 1A, but I really can't find any names in 1A who would move down to 1B.  Kyrie should probably be at least 3A, instead of 3B.  What the fuck is this business with Zion Williamson. Lower than Draymond Green? Khris Middleton? I get he didn't play many games but jeez."
"I agree that he is around a top 30 player.  Booker, Paul, Zion, Trae, Westbrook, Gobert, Towns are all better than Middleton. Players like Murray, Morant, Lavine, Randle, Siakam, Bam, and Ingram would jockey with Middleton to round out the top 30.  I think when you compare Middleton to Butler, even though their stats are similar through the last 4 seasons, Butler's performance in last year's Finals with injured teammates vs. the Lakers was miles ahead of what Middleton did this year. I know that they are playing different roles, but that is because they are on different levels. Butler has made 4 all-NBA 3rd Teams and 5 All-Defense 2nd teams. Middleton is a two-time all-star.  A top 10 level player will have their name in the MVP race. Top 20 players make All-NBA team. Top 30 Make the All-star game. Unfortunately, Khris hasn't made it to that Top 20 level yet. But, with how he has shown his growth through these playoffs, he might prove that he is a top 20 player next season.  I know some of the younger players haven't made it to that all-NBA level yet, but I have more faith in Zion or Booker making all-NBA than Middleton."
"That's true. Khris Middleton is a great player, but he is not top 20 in the league. That's the main point in this thread. Top 20 is a player that makes All-NBA or players that people complain about being snubbed. Khris is not at that level of play."
"In terms of NBA-ready, I think Duarte is second only to Cade in this class. He‚Äôs excellent in every area bar playmaking and on-ball defense. Yes, he‚Äôs old, but who cares? You value someone being young when they‚Äôre unpolished and need room to grow; Duarte is extremely polished. He‚Äôs not just a 3&amp;D guy either IMO, he‚Äôs efficient on all levels and is a good rim finisher/finisher through contract. I think his ceiling can be a Khris Middleton type player, and, were it not for his age, he‚Äôd be a top five lock. That means he has high lottery level talent, which is a great value at 13, age be damned."
what are you on buddy? why are you so mad over a simple question? lmfao jesus  Khris Middleton is a 42% career 3 point shooter  Jrue Holiday is a 39% career 3 point shooter  PJ Tucker is a 36% career 3 point shooter  Lopez is literally the only one who's shaky at 34%  Why the fuck are you cherry-picking finals stats to try and prove your dumb take?   So many questions...
"Khris Middleton, Dragic"
Gregg popovich best bet to win gold this year is  Pg jrue holiday or dame  Sg khris Middleton Sf jayson tatum  Pf draymond green or Keldon Johnson  C bambam or javele McGee
Isaiah Jackson looking like movie star Khris Middleton
To be fair their exact words were more like ‚ÄúKhris Middleton-type‚Äù
"Some quick points:  1) Sub-30% 3PT shooting last year, and it wasn't an improvement over the previous year  2) Not as good of a 2PT or FT shooter as people seem to think (overall he shot sub 45% last year and barely cracked 75 at the line)  3) Defensive ceiling seems low  He absolutely can create his own shot, but to me he comps like a Khris Middleton that can't shoot 3s (extreme hot-cold is what I mean here) and is shorter to boot"
"They hit like six threes a game because they were scoring inside...because the court was so spaced. You don't stop guarding Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday and Pat Connaughton just because they're cold."
"Better than Khris defensively? Totally possible he gets there (quickly even), but Middleton is a great defender that‚Äôs a pretty bold claim without an nba game under his belt"
Khris Middleton?  Moronic comp
‚ÄúHis floor is Khris Middleton‚Äù ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm offended
"Guys GUYS they compared Cade Cunningham to Khris Middleton, is Khris the most influential player of this generation or of all time?"
I had a dude trade me Dame for Jimmy Butler a couple years back cause he was a Bulls fan.    He also traded me Derozan for Khris Middleton.    This was back in the 2016 season so both of those were super lopsided.  I also tried to trade D. Green (Danny) for McCollum hoping that he would think is was Draymond Green but he didn‚Äôt fall for it.  I was a menace that season and ended up winning
This a thread about the laker spacing. The nets flat out have more talent than anyone you are not beating them in a shooting ever.  For all the talks about injuries in game 7 of the bucks nets . A quarter fit harden had the same amount of points with the same efficiency as khris Middleton. Gianni's and KD did Gianni's and KD things. And the game hinged on tucker somehow being more efficient than Joe harris. The nets are supposed to sweep everyone. The Lakers having better 3 point shooters is not changing a damn thing
"TRADE: Milwaukee Bucks acquire Ben Simmons. 76ers taking Giannis, Khris Middleton, all future picks until 3011, and 32oz bottle of Diet Coke."
maybe you misunderstood fellow bucks fan lol.  no teamate or especially a LEADER of a team places blame on his squad like that publicly.  this has nothing to do with the media.  imagine after game 1 instead of giannis saying WE need to be better.  giannis saying.  ya khris middleton messed it up for us.  idk what he was thinking playing like that.   thats not how it works.  embiid publicly called out simmons.  exposing the rift. and lowering simmons trade value.  that is just not a leader ship move.  i hope embiid does big things without ben simmons and puts this all behind him.
"&gt; Are you leaving Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, PJ Tucker and Lopez wide open for 3?  Middleton definitely not, everyone else you do. They got plenty of wide-open shots and bricked lots of them. Bobby was great at making wide-open 3s this season, problem is he only shot the wide-open ones and passed up many open looks."
"Are you leaving Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, PJ Tucker and Lopez wide open for 3?  They shoot well enough to space the floor appropriately for Giannis.  Jrue, Khris and Giannis can create their own shot.  They meet the criteria easily"
There‚Äôs no chance if Khris Middleton retired TODAY he‚Äôd make the hall of fame. Absolutely zero
the standard for hall of fame for the nba is a lot lower than other sports. khris middleton will 100% end up in the hof
Me and my friend were baked one time watching the Bucks and he unironically said I kinda look like Khris Middleton and I almost threw hands right there.
Lol people are gonna be so sad when he is Khris Middleton.
Recently khris Middleton in place of festus ezeli
"I don‚Äôt get why the consensus is that Cade is an oversized point guard. He has solid vision but was very turnover prone in College. I think he will end up more as a secondary playmaker in the vein of Khris Middleton or Jayson Tatum. Still worthy of the 1st pick, but a different archetype"
Khris Middleton
1 time all star Gordon Hayward aint on the list dawg.  Khris Middleton only had 2 good seasons in the decade too.  Joe Johnson and Rudy Gay should be on here.
this looks like khris middleton having a stroke
I always love his game so much. Tough mid range and strong athletic finisher. Can get buckets everywhere. Kinda like a kawhi leonard or a pf version of khris middleton
The Brandon Jennings for Brandon Knight + filler (Khris Middleton) comes to mind
Khris Middleton is way more entertaining nowadays. He used to play a really meek style of basketball. He was never as aggressive or confident as he has been over the past year or two.
"He then went on to tweet ""Fuck Khris Middleton, I wanna play with some actual shooters"""
Khris Middleton and Michael Redd also both repping 22 makes me sad
"ESPN: ‚ÄúDevin Booker calls Khris Middleton ‚Äòmid‚Äô, is there trouble brewing in the locker room?‚Äù"
Honestly though which team is better?  2020 US Olympics team vs 2020 US players not participating  2020 Team:  Bam Adebayo  Devin Booker  Keldon Johnson  Kevin Durant  Jerami Grant  Draymond Green  Jrue Holiday  Zach Lavine  Damien Lilaird  Javalle McGee  Khris Middleton  Jayson Tatum    NOT PARTICIPATING:  Lebron James  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Kawhi Leonard  Kyrie Irving  Steph Curry  Chris Paul  Bradley Beal  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Julius Randle  Russell Westbrook
ESPN: Booker calls Khris Middleton MID!?!?!?
ESPN: Devin Booker calls Khris Middleton ‚ÄúMid‚Äù. Is Team USA falling apart?
Booker Refers to Khris Middleton as ‚ÄúMid‚Äù
"I'm not saying they're done adding to their own resumes, but this is Billups' resume:  **-Finals MVP**  -5 All-Star  -1 All-NBA 2nd  -2 All-NBA 3rd  -2 All-Defensive 2nd  Even beyond that being a tall order for either of these guys at this point, Billups was generally more regarded as a bonafide star than either Jrue or Middleton. He was 5th in MVP voting in 2005-06, something Jrue/Middleton will likely never do. Middleton definitely got robbed from making All-NBA for sure, but Billups was an absolute no-doubter when he made it.  I'm not even saying it's impossible that Jrue/Khris make it but they have a shitton of work to do before people start trying to discredit Giannis' run by saying he had future HoFers as teammates."
"I think its a different commentator tho, i watch every warriors game and bob definitely doesn‚Äôt sound like that.. that guy commentating feels very animal planet documentaryish, and he called kd khris middleton, and the islamic republic of japan"
"I have been paying attention to who they're letting into the HOF and Jrue and Middleton are not in the conversation at all right now.  Stop acting like the HOF will take anyone with a pulse. Great players are getting in. Guys who are on the low end of the borderline but still had better careers than Jrue and Khris.  Bobby Dandridge took 35 years to make it and he had a better career than Jrue and Khris are likely to end with.  Chris Webber just made it, with 5 all-league teams, and it took him the better part of a decade."
First I've heard it. Kash or khris or Middleton and the very rare middy is about all I see.
"If you want team loyalty there's Damian Lillard and the Portland Trailblazers. He's arguably  the first player that pops up in my mind whenever I hear the word ""loyal"" in the NBA (mostly because he preaches it himself). Their history is also pretty respectable, they've had the Bill Walton days and their first ring, then moved on to the Clyde Drexler days, then the Oden - Aldridge - Roy days, and now the Damian Lillard era. Their social media team is good, they interact a lot with fans. Their organization is meh, their aim every season is to become a good playoff team with no championship aspirations (although now that Dame is demanding them to make moves for a championship). I would be really careful tho, there has been reports that Dame could want out of Portland so take that as you will.  Another team that screams loyalty is the Milwaukee Bucks. The history is composed of the Kareem days (one of the GOATs in basketball) winning their first championship, then to the Ray Allen days (late 90s to early 00s) and then to the Michael Redd era, then to the Brandon Jennings era. From then on, it has been downhill but their lives would change when they drafted their superstar, Giannis Antetokounmpo, who was once a Greek kid that came to America with literally nothing, and he was alone here, trying to carve a role here in the NBA. He has been through some absolute highs and lows with this Bucks team (at least from when he was a rookie up to now), and now he's one of the most beloved players in the league right now. They had 2 seasons of being contenders (one was where they kind of flopped after everyone expected them to win) and now he has carried the Bucks to its 2nd championship, along with Khris Middleton (another loyal guy who stuck with the Bucks together with Giannis) and Jrue Holiday (a guy they traded for). Their fan interaction is crazy, they have this running gag with player Bobby Portis where he's absolutely a fan favorite and they chant his name every game and stuff. They have a youtube channel where they show behind the scenes stuff (this is why i became a fan, i binged it all and they look so absolutely cool). Their org is also meh (but only recently they did good, they've done more sus moves like Kidd hiring and draft fuckups like DJ Wilson and Thon Maker).  Overall supporting these teams would be really fun especially the Bucks, since they all seem to be really chill."
"Why didn't Booker refer to Khris Middleton as ""Kha$h"", was it an intentional slight, are tensions rising in the Team USA locker room?"
BREAKING: Booker asks to be traded to play along side Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton in Milwaukee
Khris Middleton
Exactly. Imagine the bucks without Giannis and khris middleton being the guy. He is great but they would be no where near a championship
"Middleton can play the 2 during the Olympics, the other national teams don't have the quick slashing guards that can sometimes give him issues on defense.  I think they should stagger Jrue and Khris so there's always a guard/wing who's willing to pass first and play D."
Devin Booker will not pass it to Khris Middleton or Jute Holiday!
It's okay. Khris Middleton isn't playing in this game.
"&gt;Don‚Äôt start off your argument by calling someone you disagree with a ‚Äúcasual‚Äù.  I can choose my words however I'd like and I choose to call you a casual based on your lack of understanding.  &gt;As for the actual players, there are arguments on both sides. You can‚Äôt just say that people ‚Äúcan‚Äôt prove otherwise‚Äù because we literally just saw Giannis defeat KD in the playoffs and then hoist the Larry O‚ÄôBrian and Bill Russell trophies.  Except that doesn't prove anything. By that same logic, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday are better than KD as well. The best player in the Bucks vs Nets series was KD and just because the Bucks beat the Nets doesn't make Giannis better than KD lmao. Like I said earlier you have nothing to prove Giannis is better than KD."
"For a top 5 player who was dpoy/mvp level and already a finals mvp by the age of 26 when they moved him? And they tacked on one of the best 3 and D guards for no reason?    Anything less than a future franchise corner piece or a boatload of picks is shit in comparison. Demar isn‚Äôt a bad player, but this is like trading Jokic for khris middleton and then tacking on Will Barton just because. It‚Äôs just an objectively terrible and stupid move that was never going to actually help the Spurs out."
Khris Middleton sweats out two gallons of sweat per game.
"Khris Middleton averaged 15 against an even worse Magic team? He sucks too right?  20 against anyone on at least alright efficiency is good, as a first option, as a second, as any option.  They were blowing them out, again, he only played 30 minutes and averaged 20. Obviously those numbers aren‚Äôt exact, but it‚Äôs about a 2/3 ratio, we can go back to Khris Middleton who averaged 20 across 33 mpg this year. That‚Äôs a worse ratio, I hope you can figure that out. He‚Äôs not good at scoring either right? And again, Siakam did that with elite defense.  Also not sure why you keep mentioning this supposed G League Roster, even though they made the playoffs without Durant for the whole year and Kyrie for most of it. They had a bad offense obviously missing those two players, but they were still a top 10 defense last year which is what Siakam was scoring against. Losing those few games of Kyrie didn‚Äôt significantly hurt there defense."
"Khris Middleton, Paul George, Brandon Ingram  The reason being they all kind of remind of Tracy McGrady (or players like Tmac), big SG/SF‚Äôs who can shoot over people, pull up from almost anywhere or get to the mid range for a fadeaway bucket. Overall I just enjoy watching ‚Äúbig guards‚Äù that have smooth game, but that‚Äôs just one of the many aesthetics you‚Äôll get to enjoy from the NBA!"
Khris Middleton for Dame LIllard confirmed
He also broke the Heat defense lmao. Khris Middleton absolutely little boyed Duncan in the series. Please let someone in the East overpay this dude
Some people did that with Khash dollars featuring Khris Middleton.  Others did it with Kohl's Cash  And some with Culver's Free Cone Coupons.
"6'7""* team would be pretty good with a caveat  * PG Luka * SG Jimmy Butler * SF Khris Middleton * PF healthy Kawhi * C Zion  *listed heights on nba.com"

"While it wasn't as big as Denver, we had our own Big Ball lineup that actually played the most minutes in 2016.  MCW - Khris Middleton - Jabari Parker - Giannis - Greg Monroe.  They logged **538** minutes together, the shortest player was MCW at 6'5"""
"They made that trade for Brandon Knight, not Khris Middleton, who was a bit of a throw in. Also Jennings was good, but ,definitely no superstar"
"2009 - Brandon Jennings led a terrible roster to the 6th seed in his rookie year and nearly upset the Hawks (losing in 7). He then got hurt. Despite that he still lead them to the the playoffs 2 out of his 4 seasons and then got traded for Khris Middleton. At #10 this was a good pick.   2009 - Jodie Meeks. A ten year NBA career for a 41st pick is incredible. The average NBA career lasts 4.5 seasons. The average length for a 41st pick would be like 1 year. This was a great pick.   2010 - Larry Saunders at 15 in 2010 was another great pick. In 2012 he was a Gobert-esque rim protector, essentially a walking double double with 3 blocks per game.    2011- Jimmer Fredette. The Kings made this pick. The Bucks had no intention of keeping Jimmer and traded back for the 19th pick, which they used to take eventual borderline All Star Tobias Harris. An incredible pick.    2012 - John Henson at 14. Wasn't awful considering who was drafted after him. Pretty much everyone passed on Draymond who went 35.   2013 - Giannis. One of the best draft picks in NBA history.   2014 - Jabari Parker was considered a sure-fire star and was voted by his draft class as being the most likely to win ROY and to have the best career. Sports Illustrated had him on the cover calling him the ""best High School player since Lebron James'. No one was mad at this pick. He was averaging 20ppg in his 3rd season but had shocking luck with injuries.   2014 - Johnny O'Bryant. 5 years from a 36th pick isn't terrible.   2015 - Rashad Vaughn at 17 wasn't a disaster considering who was left on the board.   2016 - Thon Maker at 10. This is the first one I feel they properly messed up because Sabonis went 11. However they made up for it with their next pick.   2016 - Malcolm Brogdon at 36 is an incredible pick. Rookie of the year, 50-40-90 club, borderline All Star.    2018 - Donte DiVincenzo at 17 was a good pick. Find a new slant."
"Who was the last all-star wing player to have an athletic profile as poor as Giddey's though?   The only guy I can think of is Kyle Korver and he was an all-star purely based off his knock-down shooting. The only other guy even comparable is Khris Middleton, but I'd say Middleton is still a lot more athletic than Giddey. Giddey's lack of athleticism really puts a cap on how great he can be."
"Sucks he‚Äôs got Khris Middleton instead, what‚Äôs that guy ever going to do in the playoffs?"
They kinda fell ass backwards on Giannis and also never expected Khris Middleton to become an all-star when they acquired him
Clippers had a stud in Blake Griffin they needed to build around and had a low lottery pick by the standings (8th pick?). Getting an all star 3pt shooter for a top 10 pick isn't a bad trade.  Would be like the Pelicans trading their first round pick this year for someone like Khris Middleton.
"Game 6, the one where Khris Middleton went off and we won by 15?  The one where we held the Nets to 89 points?  Yeah, just atrocious."
There's a list of players that arent ball dominant that would fit next to almost anyone.  Klay  Pg Khris Middleton  Jae Crowder Joe Harris Evan Fournier Desmond Bayne Robert Covington  Tobias Harris  Luka needs a dominant big and some c&amp;s threats.
Bucks fans if you let that disrespect towards Khris Middleton slide I‚Äôll never forgive you. He was baby IT clutch this post season
"Giannis would lose in the first round with the roster Luka has.  He or Jalen Brunson would be the team‚Äôs best ball handler, Giannis ain‚Äôt going nowhere with Brunson as his PG get fucking real.  We have nobody on our roster even at Jrue‚Äôs level, let alone Khris Middleton. And our roster construction would limit Giannis even more than it‚Äôs limiting Luka. Better players are not always ‚Äúbetter‚Äù dependent upon situation."
Slovenian khris middleton
"Because khris middleton and jrue holiday were trash for half the series. No one on the bucks was really helping Giannis consistently, KD had games where blake griffin, Jeff Green, bruce brown stepped up on top of having 2 games of healthy kyrie. Khris and jrue were hit or miss all playoffs."
Khris Middleton....
You could just also be thinking of them in bucks alternate jerseys from last year.   https://www.si.com/.image/t_share/MTY4MDI0NjU3NjM3ODExNDcz/bucks-khris-middleton-brook-lopez-nba-playoffsjpg.jpg  https://www.fiba.basketball/api/img/team/coverimage/5/208179/27/550/418
Khris Middleton underrated.. cmon. Real ones know opposing teams are worried   Jimmy Butler may be on the opposite side on a consistent scoring production perspective of being passive in my eyes
Khris Middleton is now finally appropriately rated.
"Diamonds in the rough happen but talent will typically coalesce in the draft near the top which we see most years.  All stars this year  Beal (3), Irving (1), Durant (2), Giannis (15), Embiid (3), Brown (3), Harden (3), Simmons (1), LaVine (13), Randle (7), Sabonis (11), Tatum (3), Vucevic (16), Curry (7), Luka (3), LeBron (1), Kawhi (15), Jokic (41), Booker (13), Conley (4), Lillard (6), Mitchell (13), CP3 (4), Davis (1), PG (10), Zion (1), Rudy (27).  Top 5 - 14  Not top 5, but in the lottery - 8  outside lottery first round - 4  second round - 1  Having all star talent in the second round is such an oddity (and half any given second round won't even finish their rookie contract) that ever since 1989 (when the draft resembled what we see today) those 32 drafts have produced 20 all stars in the second round. How many of those guys have made multiple all star games?  10: Marc Gasol, Paul Milsap, Manu Ginobili, Isiah Thomas, Khris Middleton, Nikola Jokic, Carlos Boozer, Gilbert Arenas, Rashard Lewis, Green"
the fuck does Khris Middleton have to do with this
Where was khris middleton?
Giannis and Khris Middleton would actually be ridiculously good thinking about it now.
&gt;Happens with kate middleton too lol  Thought you were talking about Khris for a second
"Tons of people do. Its wild when you read stuff about reggie miller and people talk about him like one of the all time great scorers, one of the most feared players in the game, just below MJ, curry version 1.0, etc.   They treat him like dame lillard when really he was khris middleton who showed up in the playoffs, or maybe a Devin booker.  Dude was a top 10 scorer 1 time in his career and wasnt a great passer or defender."
Nah that's Khris Middleton. Or it was until the Finals anyway
Khris Middleton is more efficient than MJ though! It‚Äôs sarcasm and true based on same analytics.
"Unpopular opinion, advanced analytics and metrics can be misleading.  That‚Äôs why people don‚Äôt think Khris Middleton is better than MJ."
"Reggie miller is the most overrated player of the last 30 years. Yeah he was nice, probably ahead of his time, and had some iconic MOMENTS, but the rose tinted glasses on him are fucking out of control. He was NEVER seen as a top 10 player in the league at any point in his career, and for good reason. Top 15 was generous for a couple year window. Hes a lot closer to a Khris middleton level player than a steph curry."
"Yeah, I mean ultimately it doesn't matter its just semantics mostly just definitely a bit dumb imo, whether its the writer or the editor at fault. Nobody thinks of Luka/AD/Embiid in the same conversations as Khris Middleton. They are just categorically very different in talent, impact, etc."
"&gt;Similarly, Giannis never needed to be #1 because the team had Jabari Parker and Khris Middleton.  Are we seriously going to pretend either of those players compare to Embiid?  &gt;And, yeah, Giannis taking shots affected the spacing on those occasions he hit them. Sometimes, he got hot ;)  Okay  All year long Giannis had 3 games of 3+ makes from 3. None came in the playoffs  You‚Äôre telling me that him being hot for 3/82 games was worth the other games he was actively hurting his team bricking 3s?"
"Similarly, Giannis never needed to be #1 because the team had Jabari Parker and Khris Middleton.  And, yeah, Giannis taking shots affected the spacing on those occasions he hit them.  Sometimes, he got hot ;)"
"OK. Major difference is that Giannis was always willing to shoot and, more importantly, was always willing to be the #1 - no, really, check the internal conflict between Jabari Parker, Khris Middleton and Giannis Atentokoumpo as to who was #1.  Ben Simmons has always wanted to get paid. He has never wanted to be #1."
"&gt; contracts are based on ability, not improvement  Look, the NBA is a harsh business. The past is the past. A slightly smaller shoe size, and Jrue is over-rated and Khris Middleton was never the 2nd best player on a championship side.  And right now, Ben Simmons is being paid as the 3rd best player on a championship side. I think he isn't.  Top 30 ? Nahh. He's not the best player in most of the sides in the NBA. He is absolutely not the best player on the Sixers.  But that's irrelevant. What side is going to pay Philly for the right to pay him $170m over the next four years, or is Philly going to run it back ? None of them are going to pay anything important - Brogdon and a protected first is as good as it gets.  At the end of the day, I think Morey has fallen in love with Ben as a player, and he thinks the side is better than it is.  Good luck with that.  Philly are running it back. Joel, Ben and Tobias.  Good luck with that."
Khris Middleton but he isn't a consistent all star yet per say but I feel like he will make it next season and that would be 3 out of 4 all stars made
Khris Middleton
Mike Redd and Khris Middleton
We've got Khris Middleton coming off the bench for PJ Tucker?
It's illegal to not include Khris Middleton in this list.
That‚Äôs fake bro the original excerpt had Kris Middleton instead of Khris sooo I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre in on it and posting this just to fuck with people?

"You will feel differently if you actually watch him play. Khris is a better defender and passer but Zach will reliably score 25+ on good efficiency every single game almost, unlike Middleton who's hot and cold all the time"
"Ray Allen, Jamal Crawford, Jae Crowder, Khris Middleton, Jerami Grant"
"Ray Allen, Jamal Crawford,  Caron Butler, Khris Middleton, and Jae Crowder"
"As a heat fan we all love giannis, all wanted him im free agency. But khris middleton is one we cant stand but his clutch gene and ability to get heated whenever is something to admire"
"He is not okay, he is very good at them. Only 13 guys in the league shooting 3+ midrange shots a game had a better midrange shooting percentage than him last year. He had a better midrange shooting percentage than guys like Kawhi Leonard, Khris Middleton, Jamal Murray, Tatum, and others. And it's not like this is an anomaly, he shot basically the same percentages the season before.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shooting/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;DistanceRange=By%20Zone&amp;CF=Mid-Range%20FGA*GE*3&amp;sort=Mid-Range%20FG%20PCT&amp;dir=1"
"How in the world is Khris Middleton not better than Zach Lavine? Better defender, passer, rebounder and is almost 50/40/90 every season.   You don't think Khris Middleton could give a bad team an empty 25 a night???"
Khris Middleton.
Big Khris Middleton fan?
"That's true lol. Middleton is a good playmaker, but Giannis is overall #1 on the roster.  When he drives, he draws in the most pressure to defenses and his gravity generates a ton of wide open looks for everybody on the roster. He's also a pretty good passer.    Jrue is the best passer on the team and his passes are mostly on target, but he does not draw in defenses like Giannis does when he drives. Khris is probably our best lob passer though, as his lob passes are usually pretty on point."
"No he wasn‚Äôt consistently getting by players, he‚Äôs really slow. Dude will be khris Middleton at best, a very inconsistent player that will score 40 one night and score 13 the next"
&gt;I don‚Äôt think khris Middleton handles the ball as much   Sorry what? He handles the ball a fuck ton
"No the fuck he‚Äôs not, khris Middleton is the best play maker on the bucks and does have an abysmal assist to turnover ratio"
"Bust, dude will be lucky to be half of what khris Middleton is rn"
Yeah I think he'll need to bulk up more √† la Middleton if he's going to make the post game work in the league. Khris is a load when matched up against guards and smaller wings
"which is why he‚Äôs more Khris Middleton. Lol.  also, Middleton handles the ball all the time down the stretch. Somebody didn‚Äôt watch the champions."
Same highschool as Khris Middleton. They got a secret agent to counter the Boston strangler.
Cades ceiling is Khris Middleton.
Khris Middleton   Nikola Jokic  Sharife Cooper  I‚Äôll explain later
Khris Middleton maybe?
"Khris Middleton, he is already somewhat of a father figure to me anyways..."
"Are we talking about pace of play or agility? There are a lot of guys that play slow but aren‚Äôt necessarily slow athletes.   Kyle Anderson is one of those guys that‚Äôs just flat out slow. But, guys like D‚ÄôLo or Khris Middleton just play at a slower pace."
Khris Middleton is the slowest star in the league.
"I think that Khris Middleton is Milwaukee to a T. Under appreciated, workhorse, maybe a little inconsistent. Game would have really shined in a more mid range focused era, but has modernized enough to be great today."

"The other adjustment Melo needs to make is to convert more of his long midgrange shots into 3PA.   He started this process last year, but he still took more than 40% of his shots from midrange (10 ft+). That meant he was still an inefficient scorer despite shooting 41% on threes.  Among the 20 players who have taken the most 10+ foot 2PA over the past two seasons, the Lakers have 3 of the 4 worst (plus LeBron, who has the worst FG% (35.5%) among players with 400+ FGA):  |Rk|Player|FG|FGA|FG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:| |1|Anthony Davis|207|552|.375| |2|Jayson Tatum|218|565|.386| |3|Russell Westbrook|304|777|.391| |4|Carmelo Anthony|275|665|.414| |5|Julius Randle|278|665|.418| |6|Dillon Brooks|269|638|.422| |7|Bradley Beal|313|712|.440| |8|Joel Embiid|272|613|.444| |9|Nikola Vucevic|279|628|.444| |10|Kawhi Leonard|332|736|.451| |11|Brandon Ingram|337|741|.455| |12|Jamal Murray|248|545|.455| |13|Donovan Mitchell|256|555|.461| |14|DeMar DeRozan|415|898|.462| |15|Dejounte Murray|288|623|.462| |16|Nikola Jokic|268|555|.483| |17|Devin Booker|434|893|.486| |18|Khris Middleton|363|742|.489| |19|CJ McCollum|314|629|.499| |20|Chris Paul|464|884|.525|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 8/10/2021."
&gt;But he is on the same tier as someone like Khris Middleton  What are you 12 ? ...... Pau was above and beyond Middleton.
*But he is on the same tier as someone like Khris Middleton.*  You‚Äôve never seen Pau Gasol play I take it?
"No doubt he is. But he is on the same tier as someone like Khris Middleton. Maybe a little bit better, but he's not known as a superstar by any means. You would rather take someone like KG or Ray Allen as your 2nd best player in their prime over Pau Gasol."
People keep forgetting Khris Middleton
"&gt;I'm not sure saying ""i dont want to be there"" is an act of victimisation. If a person doesn't want to be there thats their preference. Expressing what you want doesn't mean you are playing a victim. Also, Dragic has been a player most would describe as being respectful and with integrity.  He didn't say that though. He said he ""has higher aspirations"" than playing for Toronto. And Dragic is one of the most low key dirty players in the league. Spit on DeRozan, slapped Ben Simmons, elbowed Jordan Clarkson, tried to injure Khris Middleton...this list goes on."
"Drafted Khris Middleton &gt; Ezeli in the 2012 draft  We still keep our core, win those championships etc. except Middleton can learn from Iguadala and when Barnes contract is up, we either:   1. Still sign KD and Middleton is there to replace him when he walks in 3 years  2. We never sign KD but still win those championships with Steph / Klay / Middleton / Draymond / Horford who we sign instead of KD with our max cap space"
"I've watched and been disappointed by them in the playoffs. You can see I'm in the PNW too.  CJ is not a AD or Klay or Jaylen Brown or Khris Middleton. Not to say Dame would be happy with just that alone, but I think he and most people expected CJ the last few years to be that good but he's not."
"I think the easiet comp right now is Khris Middleton and how you feel about him as the outcome for a prospect. A multi-year all-star with solid scoring and defense but never close to MVP - eh that's still a reasonable #1 pick imo considering the busts we've had before.   With that said I'm still not sold that he will continue to struggle after 1 G-league game. As someone said, never underestimate the smart players."
"Khris Middleton plays for the Bucks, the Pistons drafted Cade who might be anything in this league so let's not pretend one summer league game means anything"
The Pistons drafted Khris Middleton with the first pick? When they could‚Äôve had SGA and one or more of dozens of draft picks?
"He's gotten Khris Middleton comparisons, which I can definitely see. Even Cade said Middleton is one of the guys he models his game after."
Unfortunately shooting fouls are per the refs choosing. I remember Khris Middleton and Pat Connaughton getting obviously fouled on 3s in several games and no whistle. Refs decide when to send someone to the line
"Giannis is Giannis, but Khris Middleton is goin to have a awsome next couple years"
In between his ACL tears he had a good season while khris Middleton was hurt and then as soon as khris came back Jabari went down. Averaged 20 ppg on 49 fg%
As I said no one with just Shooters is carrying a team to the playoffs in tee league atm. There is just too much talent. Every team that will make the playoffs either has 2 all-stars or 2 Borderline all-stars. A lot of them have 3 guys of that calibre.  You have to pair with another elite offensive weapon. You could probably go for a lower tier one in someone like Khris Middleton maybe. Or Christian Wood. But really Simmons needs a PNR guard to unlock his true potential imo.
Khris Middleton hasn‚Äôt scored 30 points against the Celtics since 2018 man whoever created that sub is weird af
"He's there. Middleton is a REALLY good player, but his stock rose dramatically in the minds of people this year. Remove this year from the equation because of recency bias (just as a mental experiment because Khris was always that good) and ask the question again. You'll see that it's much closer than you originally thought. Ingram is an amazing player."
"Khris Middleton only player in NBA history to have a child, a gold medal and a ring In a 1 month span."
ESPN: is Khris Middleton a bad father?
"This is the true test when these questions come up, and you're absolutely right.  Ingram is good, but he's not the player Khris is right now. I think the absolute biggest different is leadership and clutch factor. Ingram is athletic and can score, but Middleton continuously is called upon at the end of games to close things out and does it. Ingram isn't there yet"
Now KD was Khris Middleton  on the Warriors? Interesting
"Khris ""Didn't even have to use my AK"" Middleton"
"You mean Khris ""WD-40"" Middleton?"
"It took Khris Middleton a few playoff runs, but finally this year he looked like a legit championship-caliber second option. My eye test on him the two previous playoff runs when Giannis won mvp he would miss crucial shot after crucial shot. This year, bucks need a bucket? Khris calmly gets to his spot, makes a move, bang hits a contested jumper. Now, Brandon Ingram I think has more potential than Khris due to just better physique, but he hasn‚Äôt even made the playoffs yet much less help carry his team to a championship. There‚Äôs absolutely no question Khris is the better player for now and for at least two more playoff runs when we can finally see what Ingram can do."
"What a weird way to spell Khris '' Ka$h Money"" Middleton."
JRUE HOLIDAY AND KHRIS MIDDLETON ARE GOLD MEDALISTS AND NBA CHAMPIONS IN THE SAME YEAR. HELL YEAHHHHH!
"A lineup can have Dame, Tatum, Lavine, Booker, Middleton, Bam, and more. KD still draws 2-3. Insane, and amazing to watch.  Meanwhile, I'm so happy for Jrue (US 2nd best player this run) and Khris (who looked fucking spent, lmao). Just a great time of their life.  Meanwhile Dame cleared out some of the demons and is the reason we won despite some second half stumbles."
Imagine winning the NBA championship and then an Olympic gold medal less than 3 weeks later. Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton must be on top of the world right now
"2019 FIBA World Cup team was pretty weak:  Derrick White, Donovan Mitchell, Joe Harris, Marcus Smart, Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Mason Plumlee, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Kemba Walker"
Khris Middleton might not be scoring here but the guy is great at making the right play !!
Watch Khris Middleton turn on MJ mode.
Idk why people are bringing up the fact that Middleton is an NBA champ with BI missed the playoffs without taking into account their situations. I think Khris Middleton is better but by a small gap.
Don't forget Khris Middleton
I mean ceiling are hard to determine because anything COULD happen but if you are asking me what I predict rj will be I think somewhere in the middle of khris Middleton and Bradley Beal(if everything goes right)
khris middleton
Ingram is not better than Khris Middleton
I remember hearing a question like this on a podcast about a year ago between a host and a guest. And Player A was Khris Middleton with Giannis on the floor and Player B was Khris Middleton with Giannis on the bench. Hahaha.
"I feel like CJ is the type of guy that you never really feel is a good #2 for a championship team, but also if you are trading him, its probably for picks or future assets ala a rebuild.   I think he could be like a solid #2a if there was also a solid #2b (like Khris Middleton and Jrue Holliday). But he's not like AD to Lebron or Klay to Steph or PG to Kawhi."
Went to middle school at the same school when Khris Middleton was in high school. He was nice enough to play one on one against the younger kids at lunch time. So I took an old high school jersey I had from playing there to a game and held it up at one of his games. He turned around and saw the jersey and came up into the stands and sat down next to us in the stands and talked to us for a while. Everyone around us was shocked and security was freaking out that he went up in the stands. Super nice guy.
"I‚Äôm not even talking bout super teams either. Like Suns has Booker and Paul, Bucks has Giannis, Middleton. You really gon leave Paul and Khris out for Jeremi Grant?  Not to mention, bottom teams‚Äô best players‚Äô stats are usually inflated anyway. They stat pad but don‚Äôt get their teams wins. So they aren‚Äôt actually true all-stars."
Zach Lavine came back from tearing his ACL and KD tore his Achilles. They still balling. Apparently Khris Middleton had a similar injury and he's a champion now
"I remember him as the Khris Middleton of his era, but I‚Äôm not sure how accurate that it"
"This is hilarious to me; Randle was consistently BAD in his playoff series yet this is supposed to be an argument in his favor?   Khris is not a superstar so he is not going to go off every game, but he had the most clutch shot makes in the playoffs of any player this postseason and showed up in virtually every big moment. And you know, the Bucks actually WON the title with Middleton as their second best player while having to face much stiffer competition than the Knicks ever did.  But naw give me that consistent sub 40 FG% bro"
Khris ‚Äúcomposed pace‚Äù Middleton
"You wanna find out what would happen if Luka had Jrue holiday, Khris Middleton and brook Lopez on his team?"
I‚Äôm taking crazy pills here   Middleton is a 50/40/90 guy who can run the offense just as well as Randle.  Middleton is also proven himself in the playoffs for years   What is Randle better at than khris apart from rebounding?
Khris Middleton is a 16 game player randle isn‚Äôt. Plus Middleton is better than randle
"Ignoring how ridiculous of a comment that is, you realize Khris Middleton is on team USA too so that doesn't even make sense?"
"Ignoring how ridiculous of a comment that is, you realize Khris Middleton is on team USA too so that doesn't even make sense?"
"I never said he was a bad player. I expressed my love for him plenty of times. I really like him as a human and as a player, but if you want me to put him above Jamal Murray, Deaaron fox, Bam adebayo, Khris Middleton, hes gotta learn to use his right hand  These are elite players in the NBA. There's no shame in being behind them"

nando de colo is fuckin khris middleton what is this
Khris Middleton
Lol okay so since ESPN says Khris Middleton is a top 10 player that means he is?
Who in the hell is turning on ESPN for Khris Middleton?!
That‚Äôs true but neither did Tobias Harris and Khris Middleton. Denver‚Äôs not a big market so he‚Äôs likely getting maxed
"Khris Middleton, but only because he turns into Michael Jordan whenever he plays us. Nothing against him personally though, he seems like a good guy. He really needs to stop bullying us though"

"Hopefully, I have high hopes for him, probably too high tbh (think he can be the next Pippen). Realistically around Khris Middleton level though."
"is it? just looking at old drafts i see guys like draymond green, khris middleton, spencer dinwiddie, will barton, jae crowder, jimmy butler, jerami grant, joe harris, malcolm brogdon, josh richardson, pascal siakam, dillon brooks, kyle anderson, etc, etc.. who were picked late that definitely improved from their rookie year to later career, and some of them were older when they were drafted too. dudes who prove themselves to be nba material will usually make some strides early in their career as they adjust to the speed and physicality of the nba. plus, having million dollar contracts on the line is a good incentive to hone your skills. i think the problem is that not many people in the 2nd round are nba material to begin with.  if youre talking about ""jumping tiers"" uhh sure, i dont think bane will be an all star, but there's enormous variance in the value of non all stars. if he can be even a top 100 player in the nba, how is that not a steal?  like half of the top 10 in a lot of drafts are busts.   also grayson was bad his rookie year, ask any jazz fan. true shooting percentage is 10% higher now with more volume and he can actually play defense. 40 pt game came on 11/30 shooting."
that‚Äôs what happens when you have Bryn Forbes and Khris Middleton as your wing defenders
"I believe he means insert almost any player in the league on a max and its bad and on a min its good. Most players aren't on a max so it can still apply with all maxes being good.    Even then a ton of max players being number 1 would be really bad. Most teams with 2nd and 3rd max players are competing for the title and pay them to have the talent. Guys like Tobias Harris, Kemba Walker, Kevin Love, Khris Middleton, Blake Griffin(idk how his contract actually works out right now), Russ, Wall, Lowry, Wiggins, KP, McCollum, and even guys a tier above that such as PG, Conley, and AD. If they are maxed and the number one option your team is wasting money unless they use these signing to attract other stars who are better."

"I mean there is something important to be taken from the fact that, say, Khris Middleton's teams consistently win a lot of games while Zach LaVine and Nikola Vucevic don't. Khris Middleton provides a bigger impact on winning games than guys like that, on/off based stats reveal it. Plus RAPTOR etc. all try to isolate teammate effect so not all good players on bad teams are rated as average, Towns is rated very well"
Ingram is a great 2nd fiddle ‚Äòstar‚Äô and his trajectory is similar to zion. You can‚Äôt get a ‚Äò2nd star‚Äô like that. Boi doesn‚Äôt even want the spotlight or asks for attention. He has the right mentality to be like the Khris Middleton of this team.
He plays as a 4  Khris Middleton is our SF
"I would contribute part of their loss to budenhzer playing Giannis 80 less minutes then Khris Middleton over the entire series. He averaged less minutes then George Hill. I know Giannis played one less game but still. Also averaging a double double with 50% from the field isn‚Äôt translating badly. Sure, more teams prep for Giannis in the playoffs, but you act like Kawhi didn‚Äôt exit in the exact same round the Bucks did last year"

"Yeah but part of that was:  1) Bledsoe was an absolutely god awful shot selector and took *way* too many shots.   2) Khris went ice cold against the Raptors in ‚Äò19 and shot poorly against the Heat in ‚Äò20. The whole team went come against Miami tbh.   3) We didn‚Äôt have a quality 3rd option.   We fixed problems 1 and 3 with Jrue. He is an upgrade to Bledsoe in every conceivable way. Problem 2 is TBD. Middleton had some rough games here without Giannis and didn‚Äôt play particularly well tonight, but I‚Äôm not too concerned with Jrue playing as well as he has been. I don‚Äôt see the problems we had against the Raptors and Miami repeating themselves."
A modern day khris middleton
"Based on that logic, Kyrie is a better scorer than Shaq, Kareem and Karl Malone. Better yet, Khris Middleton is a better scorer than Giannis since he can score on more levels."
That‚Äôs most overpaid player in the NBA Khris Middleton right there
"That‚Äôs fair enough and I understand that, personally however, if I was the coach of the Bucks I would much rather Giannis drive to the rim on the last possession in a 1 point game then have Khris Middleton or someone shoot a step back three that will go in maybe 35% of the time.

"I think nine of the roster spots are spoken for if they want it:  PG Steph, Dame  SG Harden, Paul George  SF Kawhi, Durant  PF Lebron, AD  C Bam  who would you have filling the other three spots on the roster? I was thinking something like this:  PG Chris Paul - good to have another floor general on the roster but might have bad blood with Harden  C Jarrett Allen/Myles Turner - backup big that prbly won't see much floor time with Bam and AD on the roster, but can be used against a big center like Jokic or Nurkic. Either of them would be a better fit than Drummond   SG Khris Middleton - thinking of a 3&amp;D guy to fill the last spot but not sure who to pick. It doesn't matter too much since whoever I pick here won't see much floor time unless someone gets hurt. I was also thinking of Tatum but he is still very young and can be picked for the 2024 team along with Zion, Beal, Trae, Fox, Mitchell, etc.  Didn't pick Butler because his offensive skills are redundant with all the ball handlers on the team already and his bad 3 pt shooting"
"That reminds me of Khris Middleton missing the 50-40-90 club because of 5 missed shots in the last game of the season and Steph also missing the club because of 8 missed shots in a season where he went 0-8 on heaves. Those 2 shots shouldn't be held against Dame though, he should get rounded up"
so khris middleton without a 3pt shot?
Khris Middleton
"Hes probably worth 15m today. In 2 years if he becomes a 18/4/3 guy on excellent defense, especially with a rising cap, he could be worth 30+.  I feel like a Khris Middleton is his ceiling. A top 45 guy."

"Bobby Portis, khris Middleton, jordan Nwora, sam merrill, bryn forbes are all shooting over 42% from deep... Jrue is right at 40%. Pat and Donte are both around 38%. We got some good shooters this year"
Khris Middleton will 100% be an all star

No Khris Middleton so your list is invalid
Khris Middleton is too good to be considered a role player but he turns into MJ every time he plays the Celtics.  Any time he makes 2 shots in a row vs. Boston I have to go hide under the bed.
&gt; only dude in the NBA doing it   Did Khris Middleton die?
"Maybe part of the issue is that he can sort of ""get away"" with bad FT shooting during the regular season. Could be a coaching issue as well - Coach Bud is notorious for being a regular season coach rather than a successful playoffs coach going back to his overachieving Hawks HC days.   Khris Middleton is a better closer than Giannis IMO, so maybe he can be Giannis's ""Kobe"". One of the reasons I don't watch as many Bucks regular season games is b/c I find Giannis's playstyle somewhat boring now. The freakish athleticism was exciting the first couple years, but I haven't seen him add all that much more to his game."
He won‚Äôt get the respect from many fans until he wins a title.  Just a fact of how some people judge the sport.  Edit: though how does Khris Middleton not even make tier 7.  That‚Äôs some real disrespect.
CJ mccollum and Khris Middleton
I mean... Andre Igoudala won the FMVP and he wasn‚Äôt even close to the best player in the NBA.   Also I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll ever have a moment where LeBron stans don‚Äôt think he deserves MVP just for existing in a uniform. What happens if the Lakers lose the finals and Khris Middleton gets FMVP? Is Khris Middleton better than LeBron?
"üòÇ  Casuals. Sorry but it‚Äôs true. Former players all said they didn‚Äôt believe in the Bucks. Y‚Äôall chose to discount them bc this sub values reporters over players. But yea the Bucks have never been a real threat because‚Äî-as it‚Äôs been stated numerous times‚Äî-you‚Äôre not winning a title or even getting to the finals if Khris Middleton is your 2nd best player. Unless you‚Äôre insanely deep  The Bucks are a lot like the early Lebron Cavs that would win 60 games. Despite the wins most people knew they didn‚Äôt have a chance. (The difference being Giannis is not Lebron, so the Bucks won‚Äôt get to the finals).    But to answer your question, no it was not ‚Äúluck‚Äù the last 2 years and this is by far not his best chance to the finals now that the Nets have harden. They weren‚Äôt gonna beat the Nets without harden either"
Picturing Khris Middleton running back and forth pissed off at this dude shooting free throws is hilarious.
Bro do you know how dumb that argument is? Have you watched them play? Middleton gets a ton of floor time without Giannis. They don‚Äôt share the court 24/7. Like come on man. How am I supposed to talk basketball with people that don‚Äôt watch the teams play?   Lmao bruh you don‚Äôt watch them play and it‚Äôs obvious. You want to know what Middleton averaged last year without Giannis? Middleton averaged 26/6/5 on 48/41/94 splits in 9 games without Giannis. [Here‚Äôs the link for that](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=middleton+stats+without+giannis+2019-20)  [Go read this article and educate yourself on Middleton.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2020/2/28/21157234/khris-middleton-miwaukee-bucks-all-nba-case-synergy-stats-shot-profile) It‚Äôs obvious you don‚Äôt watch him play because you‚Äôre claims that ‚Äúhis efficiency will take a huge hit without Giannis‚Äù is statistically false.
Yes but Khris Middleton would not average 30/5/8 in no reality. Bro isn't that level of a passer or scorer
"Tatum is (way) better defensively, that makes a huge difference, Khris was really good a few years back but he's clearly slept a lot even tho he's still great a some specific things (I like his screen navigation).  Offensively I think Tatum has more upside from game to game because of the step back 3, but Middleton's passing makes it really close, and he's not benefiting that much from playing with Giannis since his coach is too dumb to actually use them in PNR more despite that play getting them a good shot EVERYTIME they do it.   I'd take Tatum, but it's not ridiculous to expect Middleton to outplay him if they meet in the playoffs"
Khris middleton
"Tough to argue that Kyrie is top 15 for ‚Äúteam impact‚Äù. He hardly has a great track record of elevating teams. There are a lot of number 2 guys in the league who I would consider worse than Kyrie in every way except that they seem to make a more positive impact on their teams. E.g. someone like Khris Middleton is worse than Kyrie in most ways I would traditionally judge talent. Worse at creating plays, creating his own shot, passing, getting to the hoop, and arguably worse at shooting. Not that he‚Äôs a bum or anything, Kyrie is just very skilled. Even with that said, I also have trouble imagining a situation where Middleton misses 15 games and the Bucks are 37-30 with him and 12-3 without him.  Maybe that‚Äôs a fluke, but if we‚Äôre going to judge guys on their ‚Äúteam impact‚Äù we should judge by their actual impact."
Who‚Äôs gonna shoot? Khris Middleton the only legit outside shooter the bucks have. Jrue and Lopez are decent and Giannis can if he has to but not at an efficient level. Our starting lineup contains 4 guys who are automatic from deep.
Khris Middleton should be in over Drummond.

Khris Middleton is looking like prime Durant. It was hella annoying when he made those triples yesterday
Khris Middleton
Khris Middleton and Rudy Gobert
"Trae Young - his wacky ass hair  Michael Kidd-Gilchrist - I used to always draft this guy in fanasty draft in 2k14 and he sucked. Also he was picked 4th in his draft class how isn't he cyberbullied more  Khris Middleton - So underrated he's overrated and I hate it for some reason.  On a totally seperate note I just hate watching the Celtics. I don't know if it's their offense, or lack of an inside presence, but I just get bored watching them. It's probably their jersey's, as iconic as they are."
"The khris middleton hate is stong here, the fuck are you on about?"
Khris middleton thought he was playing the Celtics tonight
"Milwaukee traded Brandon Jennings to Detroit for Brandon Knight, Khris Middleton, and Slava Kravtsov. I wanna say Khash was put in to make the salaries work?"
"Right now it‚Äôs Khris Middleton.   Why does he have to be such a great clutch shooter? Learn to brick one every once in a while, stop being such a great player"
Everyone please retire the daily ‚ÄúKhris Middleton thinks he‚Äôs playing the Celtics‚Äù against any other opponent he goes off against. It‚Äôs really annoying
Khris Middleton is a baller. That is all
Khris ‚Äúmvp candidate‚Äù Middleton
I HATE KHRIS MIDDLETON MAN FUCK
Bucks really need a second star to pair with Khris Middleton
Khris Middleton said he‚Äôs the closer this year.  Shots like this should come up in the clutch rating
khris middleton.
"Bucks missing all these FTs, very sloppy.    But the high PnR by the Mavs that always kills the Bucks isn't working as well as Bucks change up the defensive looks.  Nice to see team fix old flaws, Dallas used to give their defense fits.  Kinda rough first half for Bobby Portis.    Dallas has no one to defend Middleton at all.  I guess Richardson could help, but he doesn't really look like he could defend Khris either.  Khris could honestly be even more aggressive, he even turned down a couple opportunities."
No thank you. Khris Middleton does enough already
Probably Khris Middleton
Khris Middleton or Tyler Herro? IDC honestly I‚Äôm mostly dead inside
"You might actually be right or Keldon might be close to it. I started listing some of the best SFs in the league and there's a pretty big drop off once you get past Ingram or DeRozan level: Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Paul George, LeBron James, Brandon Ingram, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward, Khris Middleton, Bojan Bogdanavic, DeMar DeRozan, Michael Porter Jr., Malik Beasley, TJ Warren, OG Anunoby  I'm sure I'm forgetting some guys but I was thinking that the SF position was much deeper than that."
"Their worst matchups in my opinion are the Lakers, Bucks, Clippers and Sixers (in that order) and theres a world where they have to face 3 of these teams in one playoff run. Their biggest problem, at least in my opinion, is rim protection so its important to look at the teams that will feast at the rim.  The Lakers will absolutely be able to feast against the Nets at the rim and it gets even worse when you think about the minutes where they will have to have a backup center in the game going up against Monrezl Harrell. Can you really trust a guy like Claxton against not only Harrell but against the other players coming off the bench for the Lakers. Not to mention that Lebron/AD will be playing most of the game and theres nobody on the team that can defend AD at all. Tough matchup for the Nets and I feel that they would have a better time in next years playoffs if its against the Nets.  On the Bucks it is entirely possible that Jrue, Giannis, and Khris work together to contain James or Kyrie and negate some of the guard offense that Brooklyn will be reliant on, but even if they don't there isn't anyone on the team who can stop Giannis. They're going to have to build an even tighter wall than we've ever seen and this will allow Middleton and Holiday to put up big numbers. This is a series where Deandre Jordan could foul out easily in every single game and leave the Nets scrambling for extra paint defense. Honestly an incredibly tough matchup, but one where I can see the Nets coming out on top because of their absolutely insane offensive potential.  The Clippers have as ideal of a lineup as you can ask for against a team with an elite offensive PG, SG, and forward. Beverley, PG, and Kawhi on Kyrie, Harden, and Durant is about as good as you're going to find in the league and with a guy like Serge Ibaka backing them up that's going to at least present a bigger challenge for the Nets than 95% of teams can present. The issue with the Clippers is honestly the same with the Nets. Both teams are going to be reliant on guys who disappear in the playoffs, guys who are prone to injury and on a team with guys who understand the heaps of pressure being put on them. The Clippers and Lakers being the two western favorites is pretty much the least ideal situation Brooklyn could ask for.  The 76ers are basically the anti-Nets. They're super defensive and play above the rim. Theres a world where Simmons is on KD, and then you figure the rest out from there, with Embiid locking up the paint. Who can guard Embiid on this team? This is a series where Dwight Howard can actually put up 10 pts, 10 rebs off the bench and Shake can average 13-16 ppg off the bench. I would bet the house on the Nets winning this series but there is a world where we see the Sixers looking completely unstoppable at the rim.  I would bet on the Nets getting to the finals and losing, then looking better next year after getting more front court depth."
"Khris ""The Boston Strangler"" Middleton"
Khris middleton turns into a mixture of mj and curry when he plays us. Whenever we play I always worry more about him than giannis
"1. LeBron 2. Giannis 3. KD 4. AD 5. Steph 6. Kawhi 7. Harden 8. Dame 9. Luka 10. Jokic 11. Embiid 12. Paul George 13. Bradley Beal 14. Jayson Tatum 15. Devon Booker 16. Jimmy Butler 17. Jaylen Brown 18. KAT 19. Ben Simmons 20. Kyrie 21. CJ 22. Khris Middleton 23. Sabonis 24. Brandon Ingram 25. Chris Paul 26. Trae Young  I would take any of these players over Westbrook in a heartbeat and I'm probably forgetting others. He might compete for that next spot with Donovan Mitchell, Zach Lavine, and Vucevic."
"Were you following your team back in 2011? Remember the guy your team embarrassed? The guy who went from being the possible best player in the world to averaging 17 and even Jason freaking Terry stopping him from getting easy ones close to the basket because he had no post game?  Yeah, that guy had his 3rd MVP in the year just after.  Nobody cares about playoff performance for a regular season award. I have absolutely no idea where that myth started. The evidence on the matter is *exactly* opposite.  What matters is seeding and the competition. For example if LA keep beating everything and Lebron ends up clearly better than AD during the run (a real possibility), Lebron wins it hands down. If however a Paul George led Clippers surpass his team, then PG is the favorite. Maybe KD does historic carry job and despite the dysfunction within the team they end up first overall. Then KD gets it.  If however in any of the 3 (above) examples those players let their team reach the 1st seed (or even 1st overall) by comitee (say AD/Kawhi/Harden have a massive impact as well) then there is no MVP for either of them.  You need an extremely high seed (top 2 preferably) *and* leading your team in a clear manner (say all adv stats have you as the clearly better player ... all of them). There is literally no other consideration (apart from the one, Westbrook MVP that is, which was supremely weird).  So yeah, Giannis has no chance (for the time being) because his team is neither 1st seed (or -preferably- 1st overall) nor is he the clear best guy in his team. Khris Middleton is right there with him. So no chance for him, nothing to do w playoffs though. If he mounts a similar season to last and suddenly have the Bucks as the clear 1st overall team you bet you a$$ that he gets it for the 3rd time in a row.  I don't believe the above (to be) probable, but yeah it is *not* because of his playoff woes (perceived or otherwise)."
"KD is one of the greatest players of all time. I'm by no means saying Khris Middleton is near his level, simply pointing out he's no scrub. He averaged 25.6 against the Heat and can absolutely take over a game when he gets hot."
"Ah grats bro, you just proved you know literally nothing about basketball. Look up some Khris Middleton highlights. He's got one of the wettest mid range jumpers in the league, and shot 49/41/91 last year with 21 ppg."
Probably Khris Middleton.
"I think the most surprising thing to me is that Khris Middleton leads the Bucks in DWS, when he is considered the worst defender (though still pretty good) among that starting 5."
"imma be honest, neither of those are similar to the paul dunk someone linked earlier  he had a wide open lane in both of those dunks, granted he still finished through some amount of contact because the defenders got there late, but pierce was straight up dunking *on* people. Whereas in those clips luka had no one in front of him to take off.   obviously luka is capable of dunking, he's a 6'7"" athlete, but definitely not a part of his game. he's more similar to khris middleton in that regard."
"Well, a really low first rounder is justifiable. Like Lakers don‚Äôt really need him, but that kind of first rounder would be a defensible trade from both sides. Milwaukee too. But late first rounders have value on teams that were able to find Talen Horton and Khris Middleton late in drafts."
"I guess Khris Middleton is not a household name for you since you didn't realize he's cool so he spells it with a 'k.'      I think most people share your view one way or the other.  The current state of the league is great for the players, probably not great for fans, especially ones that like rivalries.  I live in LA and the vibe that I got was that this past title was not really all that special for a lot of Lakers fans because it was more just like a bunch of dudes wearing Laker uniforms that won a title.  Now, granted, we're in a pandemic, so there's not going to be some huge title parade or anything.  Just a vibe I got though.  There was no real struggle to get that title, so it wasn't that special.       If the Clippers win this year, will anyone really care?  Same with the Nets.  You'd say the Raptors were kind of a mercenary team when they won since it was with Kawhi, but the core of that team was together for a while and had a lot of playoff heartbreak in the years leading up to that.  So it seemed like that title meant something.      Some basketball atheists like Nate Duncan feel like they just want to see the best basketball possible.  They don't really care if the bottom of the league is that good.  They just want the best product, and if that's basically like watching the All-Star game, then it is what it is.  I disagree with that approach, but it seems like a lot of people feel like that."
Not a guarantee. But...I mean...who else can compete? Giannis? and Khris Middleton? Idk.
"Not unknown, but Khris Middleton"
There you go.  I haven't heard jack shit about Khris Middleton all year.  That's quietly good.
"Middleton was hyper-efficient last season too, but he's taken it to a higher level.  I just tend to watch other games than the Bucks (even if I have them on another screen) b/c every time I look over it's the bench unit. Jrue and Khris look great, BroLo looks even slower, and I can't tell if Giannis has improved his game or not. I *feel* like he's not driving to the rim as much as before, and I've seen him take some midrange Js (including some fadeaways), but I don't think he's gotten the hang of that stuff yet."
Indeed. It feels like there already have beem more (deserved) Gordon highlights on the front-page this season than during all of last season combined.  The one player who really has a quiet and overlooked great season so far is Khris Middleton. Nobody talks about him but his numbers are equally impressive.
Khris Middleton also has most googly eyes
Doesn't Deandre project to be a better defender than Middleton? He's got the size and muscle that Khris doesn't have.

Paul George is a better player than Khris Middleton. But Khris is a better shooter in all facets of the game.
"I'm not trashing PG, just saying Khris Middleton is the 3-and-D wing who does a bit of everything"
Herro probably will never be as good as Brad.  He‚Äôd be lucky to be a Khris Middleton 2.0 at his peak.
Khris Middleton has turned into prime Dennis Rodman
Khris Middleton is a better rebounder than your small forward
Khris Middleton is the player that a bunch of people thought Paul George was
\#allstarszn! It's time. I think the East All-Stars right now should/would be (in no particular order):  * Zach LaVine * Nikola Vucevic * Khris Middleton * Kyrie Irving * Joel Embiid * Malcolm Brogdon * Kevin Durant * Seth Curry * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Jaylen Brown * Jayson Tatum * Julius Randle
"Can't hate those guys for their play ,  I'd put khris Middleton in the conversation with those guys too guy has been great from everywhere"
Khris Middleton? Sabonis? Vucevic?   Also GTFO here with Westbrook being in consideration.

"Lol forgetting Khris Middleton, who actually plays for a team that has more than two wins??"
"In brief, offensively he's a better shooter from everywhere except at the rim (though even there Jokic is great). Jokic is a better passer which I think sort of goes without saying, both in terms of skill but also passing instincts and placement. Jokic also because of his touch and skill has a more versatile offensive game than Giannis. He can dominate a game with just passing and only scoring a few points, which I don't think Giannis can do. He can decide to dominate by just posting dudes up, or if that doesnt work, can face up and shoot or create from the post, top of the key, the elbow, or wherever. He literally is the Nuggets system in a way that even still I don't think Giannis is - in this way I compare him to Peyton Manning. From an outside perspective at least, the Bucks system seems to be a bit... my turn your turn, Giannis does a drive or PnR, then perhaps Khris Middleton runs a spread PnR, then Jrue (formerly Bled). I could be a bit wrong, and it's undoubtedly been highly effective in the regular season, but Giannis has obvious limitations on offense that even his otherworldly athletic ability hasnt been able to over come yet in the playoffs...  Which leads me to my next bit - Jokic consistently has improved each year, if in more marginal ways than Giannis. But I'm a bit concerned Giannis might be plateauing - it doesnt really seem like he's added anything substantive to his game this year so far, his touch from 3, midrange, and FTs isnt any better or worse than it was last year. Whereas Jokic more than anything, this year, looks just in command of the team and the game. His skills offensively are the same but he's transitioning into an even more active role dictating where he wants his teammates to go, what they need to do. Similarly, Jokic consistently grades out as one of the very best players in the NBA in the clutch - shooting something like 72% in the last two minutes of games and OT, while he also elevates his defense in those moments. In 33 playoff games, Jokic has also been incredible, averaging 25/11/7 on 55/42/84 shooting splits in 38 mpg (so he doesnt get played off the floor at all and only commits slightly less than 4 fouls per game), along with 1.1 steals and 0.8 bpg. Giannis we can remove his first playoff run I think - the last 4 years then, which is 37 playoff games, comparable to Jokic, Giannis averages... 25/11/5 on 55/32.5/63 splits, with 1.1 steals and 1.5 blocks. All this is to show that Jokic's game elevates in the playoffs and the clutch, while Giannis's has been great, but not quite as great as in the regular season.  Defensively of course Giannis is incredible (though I think somewhat poorly used by Bud at times - I don't understand his refusal to at least in the playoffs unleash Giannis as an isolation defender), he's a superior player to Jokic there in every way. Jokic isn't bad defensively, however, is my only point. I won't belabor it but the Nuggets always have graded out better with him on the floor than off defensively, in a whole host of metrics. Jokic is a good post defender, good positionally, smart, good rebounder, etc.  The last two points I have are simply - the game is about getting buckets, and longevity. Jokic I think, as an offensive system unto himself, gets buckets for himself and others at a rate that's literally as good as anyone in the game. Part of my evidence for this - there are only 3 players Jokic has ever played with who have been a net negative when paired with him, and one is Emmanuel Mudiay. The others? Trey Lyles and Jerami Grant. Two of those guys are *barely* NBA players. He just makes everyone he plays with better, for the most part, if they're at least competent. That's probably true of Giannis though too, in different ways. Defensively, and in terms of lightening the load offensively like Jokic. Which is why I mention longevity - Giannis blessedly hasnt had any injuries yet, really, but his game is predicated on athleticism, while Jokic's is not. On balance, my hunch is this means Jokic's game will age better than Giannis's. If he doesnt get bored or tired of playing, Jokic could play till he's 40 like Dirk did and still be effective offensively at least, considering his game is quite low impact. Meanwhile for Giannis the model is clearly LeBron - but LeBron is a better passer, always has been really... and LeBron really learned how to shoot at least well enough that defenses have to respect his shot. Giannis could do that still, but so far he's just been... well, a horrible shooter, every year except his rookie year. And his FT% has gotten worse every year too which doesn't bode well.   Damn I said I'd be brief but look at that, I wrote an essay."
Khris Middleton airballing
i got banned from the bucks sub due to talking trash about khris middleton but i'm starting to think he's better than kemba
You‚Äôre just salty Khris Middleton lights your ass up
Does anyone remember when Khris Middleton signed a 5 year 70 million deal and people used to rag on how overpaid he was? 5 years later and Gobert is getting 200 million.
"In the years prior to last season he had 4 first round exits. In those series he averaged (rounding): 27/8/4, 28/9/7, 25/6/3, 29/9/4 and about 1.5 steals overall. Yeah TS was not amazing but the media has twisted everybody into thinking these were terrible performances because he said some dumb shit after Dame hits an impossible shot.  Seriously how many contemporary swingmen are putting up comparable/better playoff numbers than that? Lebron, Kawhi, Harden? How many future HOFers put up worse playoff numbers than that? (Paul Pierce comes to mind but there may be others) Why isn't Khris Middleton taking this kind of flack?"
It's not because the Wizards lost. It's because Steph is the second most popular player in the league. Warriors got blown out by the Bucks but all the highlights on ESPN where of Steph not Giannis or Khris Middleton.

Hawks make the ECF  Khris Middleton makes All NBA 1st team  Jokic wins MVP
@khris middleton
Where the hell is this trade Ingram stuff coming from lmao? I get trying to build around Zion but do you think Khris Middleton is magically available or some shit?  I'd try to get rid of Bledsoe ASAP and go for a stretch 5.
"Khris Middleton is a perfect #3 option that the Bucks badly need to be a #2 but I just don't think he works as that. His handle isn't tight enough and he has trouble when he gets double teamed. If Giannis wasn't such an immense talent the Bucks would be falling apart at the seams.  I don't see anyone else on the roster that can consistently create in a slowed down, half court setting. Giannis just has to continue to improve or they have to make a trade. Holiday can create but he isn't being shown the ball enough. Either you focus on running up the score so you don't end up in close situations or you treat Holiday as your #2 and Middleton as the #3 at the end of games.   Holiday is the better passer, has the better handle, and forces teams to choose between doubling Giannis *or* sticking to Middleton. The ball should be in his hands at the end of games and they should try to use him to get the ball to either Giannis or Middleton in advantageous positions."
"The article highlights what any smart basketball fan who has watched the Bucks for years can see:   - Giannis is much more devastating as a play finisher than as a play creator, especially in crunch time situations at the end of games.   - Giannis on a championship team is a lot more like Anthony Davis than he is LeBron.   - When Giannis is the play creator on the team, he's a 7-foot Westbrook, which is an incredible player, but one that's got glaring flaws that will be exacerbated in a playoff setting.   - Bucks are better off letting Middleton and Jrue make decisions with the ball in their hands in late game situations than Giannis, Middleton is the best bucket gettor on the team, and Jrue is the best decision maker on the team. Middleton is the 2nd best decision maker on the team.   - The existential question for the Bucks now is are Middleton and Jrue good enough to be your primary creators on offense on a championship caliber team? Will Jrue Holiday be more aggressive on offense when it counts like you could argue he needs to be on this team? 2 player comps I would make, is Jrue Holiday is smaller Jimmy Butler and Khris Middleton is smaller Kevin Durant."
"Wiggins has played well this year, he‚Äôs not the problem. We brought him in as a third option and expecting him to be a solid #2 after Klay got hurt is just not what he is. I think he‚Äôs a worse version of Khris Middleton - a third option that probably won‚Äôt yield you championship success if he‚Äôs your second option. Our depth is an issue as we have a bunch of young guns who are developing and adapting to the warriors offense while at the same time not being able to consistently hit wide open shots"
"&gt;Yes. He was back-to-back MVP for a reason, but he just needs better sidekicks than Khris Middleton and Bledsoe/Holiday to compete for a title.  Bucks are contenders. Yeah they'll probably lose to the Nets but lets not rule them out already. They at least have a way better point differential than the 76ers"
Khris Middleton has got to be in 2nd
"Yes. He was back-to-back MVP for a reason, but he just needs better sidekicks than Khris Middleton and Bledsoe/Holiday to compete for a title."
"And khris Middleton, Steph curry, Zach lavine, Kyrie Irving, Kevin durant, Paul George are also close"
"**TEAM KESAVAHRAJ**  New expansion team owner G_Kesavahraj immediately earns the support of his fan base after adding a star laden roster that appears to fit very well together. Wings Bradley Beal and Jimmy Butler highlight the group, while BFFs Tobias Harris and Boban earn the fan love on social immediately.  After a 3-3 start to the year, the team finds their rhythm and chemistry. Beal and Butler prove to be an ideal yin/yang, as Beal provides the shooting and spacing while Butler focused on crashing to the line, dishing, and bothering every other wing on defense. Both players average 20 PPG as the team swells up to a 28-20 record midway through the year. Both Beal and Butler make the All-Star team.  At times, the presence of Boban as a starter slows the team's pace down, but with Beal and Tobias Harris the club still feels like they have enough shooting to play a half court game if need be. The club finishes the regular season as the # 3 seed out East.  In the playoffs, the team turns up the gas even more, crushing the feel-good story Knicks 4-1 in round one. Goran Dragic showcases his own scoring prowess in the series with 21 PPG, perhaps having saved up his energy for the playoffs. At this point, the team truly feels like a title threat.  But in round two, the group matches up against the Milwaukee Bucks and Giannis, who may prove a handful for them. Sure enough, Tobias Harris struggles with the matchup, and switching over Jimmy Butler leaves some open holes on the perimeter. Khris Middleton hits 5 threes in game 2, leading to a 2-0 lead for the Bucks.  Now down in the series, all the good vibes start turning sour. Jimmy Butler gives a press conference, blasting the team's defensive effort (and making indirect shots at Beal in the process.) The group responds with a strong Game 3 win, but falls back into old habits in a Game 4 loss. Butler puts the team on his back and scores 31 in Game 5 to pull off another win and take the series back to 3-2. Still, the Bucks' hot shooting ends up carrying them in Game 6, leading to a bitter defeat.   The team licks its wounds and pride after the loss. Surely, they had the talent to compete for a title, but it just wasn't in the cards this season."
"Simmons is better than one of them but he's not better than both.  If anything it's Tobias shade- there was a time a few years ago when him and Khris Middleton were almost the same player.  Since then, Khris has blossomed while Tobias has regressed."
"Khris Middleton is a better second option than Jamal Murray, and Ben Simmons isn't the Sixers second option, Tobi Harris is, and Middleton is better than him"
"At the moment, he's in between:  Khris Middleton  CJ McCollum  **WB**  SGA  Pascal Siakam"
Khris Middleton barely missed being as good as Bird
He was tired of getting destroyed by Khris Middleton so he decided to go to his team instead
The Blazers would break 40 wins the season after LMA left  Khris Middleton the more intriguing piece of the Brandon Knight trade  Giannis would be good enough for people to learn how to spell his last name (on draft night)  Kyle Lowry future all star (during his first year in Toronto)
"In the game Kyrie that went down at the end of the first half, the Bucks won and tied the series at 2-2. That was with Jrue Holiday playing super ass and Khris Middleton playing pretty terrible for the most part as well outside of one game (which they won). The fact of the matter is that the series was tied going into game 5 when KD finally had neither Kyrie or Harden even though the Bucks were not even playing close to their best basketball. It wasn‚Äôt like the Nets were playing great defense or anything either, the Bucks were just missing open looks. I think it‚Äôs too short-sighted to say the Nets would beat the Bucks easily even without Kyrie."
Khris Middleton was literally better than prime MJ in 2018 against the celtics. A single playoff series has high variability. Not so surprising that giannis had prime shaq stats over 6 games against a smaller team like phoenix.
It‚Äôs really hard to rate Khris Middleton
"Khris Middleton, I wouldn't say I disliked him per se, just doubted how good he was. The more I watched the Bucks last year and especially this year the more his game and basketball IQ stood out to me.  The dude guards one of the top 2 players on the court for the other team like 80 percent of the game, the offense actually runs through his movement and decision making, their half court offense really relies on him getting the ball and making the right play, and he does that like 90 percent of the time, and his scoring ability is similar to me at least to KD, although obviously not as high volume, the way he scores and his skills etc is similar.  Let's not forget this dude is CLUTCH AS HELL."
Every raw wing now compares to Jaylen or Khris Middleton.
"CJ got the ‚Äòsexier‚Äô and maybe arguably more explosive game (50pt type) but completely agree, Middleton is def in a tier above.  His height, post up game, clutchness and defense allow him to be effective the same throughout playoffs whereas CJ has struggled a bit.  Imagine blazers replacing CJ with Khris - him RoCo and Nurk would be a pretty good defense."
"Khris Middleton and Giannis PnR, which we don't use very often."
the spirit of Iso Joe is in Khris Middleton and SGA right now.
Khris Middleton is the obvious answer.  Could even see Brook getting it if he plays out the rest of his contract.
"Khris Middleton ! I don‚Äôt have a reason why I disliked him to be honest I just did, but seeing what he did on the Bucks this last year he became one of my favorite players"
There‚Äôs also still that weird cult who hate Khris Middleton. I still don‚Äôt get it but there are fans who want him traded.
"Melo easily, this wasn‚Äôt even a conversation in their prime, cause it was so obviously Melo.  There is so much revisionist history since PP won a championship as a 2nd option on a super team. It would be like if 10 years from now people are saying Khris Middleton is better than Devin Booker, because he is a better defender and passer and won a ring with Giannis lol."
"&gt;maybe the best dunk contest ever with Lavine and Gordon  I'm pretty sure the entire ASW was one of the best if not the best ever as well. The 3 point contest was star-studded with Devin Booker, James Harden, Kyle Lowry, Khris Middleton, JJ Redick (who was lead the league in 3P% that year at 47.5%), Klay Thompson, CJ McCollum and Stephen Curry. It went down to the wire between Steph and Klay- with Klay taking it all by saving his all-moneyball rack for last. The skills challenge was also one of the better ones in memory as it was the first time a big won it (KAT beating IT in the final round)"

"It‚Äôs disgusting no one has picked Khris Middleton yet, smdh"
"It's harder than I thought, I have 28 names right now.  (IN NO ORDER)  Lebron James  James Harden  Kevin Durant  Giannis  Damian Lillard  Steph Curry  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Trae Young  Donovan Mitchell  Khris Middleton  Jrue Holliday  Jamal Murray  Klay Thompson  Anthony Davis  Russell Westbrook  Kawhi Leonard  Paul George  Jayson Tatum  Kyle Lowry  Pascal Siakam  Jimmy Butler  Zach Lavine  Luka Doncic  Ja Morant  Kyrie Irving  Bradley Beal"
"Steph, Ray, James Worthy, KG, Daugherty Plus David Thompson, Khris Middleton, English, Bobby Jones, and Jermaine O‚ÄôNeal. The starting lineups are comparable but charlottes depth is unbeatable"
"Let's bring to the table the mid-range shot then.   Dejounte Murray shot better from the midrange than KAWHI LEONARD while attempting more shots. I highly doubt Kawhi is criticized for his mid-range abilities, instead he's called as someone who never misses from there, considered as one of the best ones in the league. And rightly lemme say because Kawhi is an extremely good mid-range shooter, but have you ever seen someone saying that DJ is at his level.  Actually, only considering the ones that shot more than 210 mid-range shots, DJ is ranked 8th. Better than him, in order, we find: CP3 (382), Jokic (235), Embiid (285), Booker (346), Ingram (354), Beal (333), DeRozan (331). DJ shot an amazing 45.4% with 302 attempts!   Behind him you can find the rightly considered Mid-Range Master Khris Middleton (just 20 more attempts and 0.3% worse). Also Kawhi, Dame, Curry...  (Worth mentioning Nikola Vucevic: less than 1% worse than DJ but with like 70 more shots. Also Irving and KD are excluded because they didn't shoot much because they didn't play much)   And we gotta say that DJ came to the league as a complete terrible shooter, really, he couldn't shoot at all. So he slowly developed one and he is progressing with the range.   Also let's add the fact that he was injuried for a full season and also played his rookie year mainly in the G-League.   Ja Morant played a total of 4127 minutes in the NBA and he's going into his 3rd Season. Dejounte Murray played a total of 5891 minutes in the NBA and he's going into his 5th Season. Their age difference is just 2 years too.   So I'm not saying DJ is the shooting maestro, but he's crazy underrated in everything and especially his shooting abilities!"
Honestly surprised it‚Äôs not Khris Middleton vs Boston
"Khris Middleton is a second option but he lives on tough shots, and kinda sucks at getting to the rim to boot, and he was still like two FGM away from 50/40/90 in 2020. You get a guy like that (or KD, who is basically a much better Middleton as far as shot profile is concerned) and they‚Äôll have a shot at it. No coach in their right mind is going to get mad at a guy shooting 50+% on self-created midrangers because he‚Äôs not taking enough threes, efficient offence is efficient offence."
"I mean, it is an example of 50/40/90 metric flaws. I could probably say the same for someone like Khris Middleton or Kevin Durant who have just missed the cut on 50/40/90 stats (because of the FG%/2P% dilemma), this is just one stat that was posted a while ago in this sub and an already confirmed one. This stat also does put a context someone who was 50/40/90 and someone who wasn't, so that's why I'm using it. I just needed an example like this one off the top of my head and I just went with it."
&gt; Khris Middleton is more valuable than Kevin Durant  - 538. I always knew those dudes shitposted on r/mkebucks.
"Maybe Morey is envisioning a 5 team trade where every team fleeces the next team by increasing amounts, so that by the time the trade loops back around the Sixers have Dame, and somehow Portland has Khris Middleton, Clint Capela, Devin Booker, and now Steve Nash is somehow back in the league and Brooklyn is coached by Harden and KD screaming at eachother"
"No it makes you a good shot creator, they are good shooters but not elite or great. Guys like Steph, Dame, Kyrie, Khris Middleton, Paul George, Zach Lavine and KD are elite 3pt shooters off the dribble. Chucking loads of 3s at below league average efficiency doesn't make someone a great shooter just because they chose to take a more difficult shot. It can be a great tool to open up other parts of their games like their driving and passing, but it doesn't make them elite or great shooters."
"Lebron ""Khris Middleton"" James"
I watched like 75/82 of the 13 win season for the bucks. But surprisingly I enjoyed that year cause I got to watch rookie Giannis and a pretty young impressive player in Khris Middleton. The darkest for me was the year before watching us trade our promising young stud Tobias Harris for a disgruntled Redick
"Wow I haven't thought about Michael Finley or seen him mentioned in like 10 years. For some reason I vividly remember Mark Cuban getting really mad about him not getting voted in as Dallas' 3rd All-Star alongside Dirk/Nash  He was kind of like the Khris Middleton of his time, did a little bit of everything you wanted from a 2nd/3rd option and super easy to plug and play"
Khris Middleton.   Anthony Johnson had a good career and hopefully Aaron Nesmith will too
So KDs whole argument over Giannis is that you can give him the ball at the end of games to get buckets and he's clutch.   So then your are admitting that Khris Middleton out clutched KD and is a better closer.   I'll take that.

Khris Middleton üòÖ
Khris Middleton and the Celtics?
&gt;Khris Middleton is not inconsistent; he is an all-nba level player &gt;  üíÄüíÄ
McCollum has pretty much always been one of the blazers weak links on defense.  You‚Äôre right Middleton shouldn‚Äôt be in the conversation for all defense but just being above average on defense which I think khris is is enough to be significantly better than Cj on defense.  Add on khris scores as well as cj by volume even though Cj puts up 22ppg to khris 20 as Cj plays 35mpg+ some years while bud load manages his guys a lot.  Cj has never come close to khris‚Äô efficiency last year and was average efficiency wise til this season where he missed half the year(means we‚Äôre not confident he can keep it up next year)
"Harden still performs at superstar levels in the playoffs, even though he does underperform his regular season numbers  Khris Middleton is not inconsistent; he is an all-nba level player  Russ is neither as good nor as bad as his stans and haters think.  In his last peak primary option year in OKC he was a borderline all-NBA player.  Kawhi is no longer a great defender, although his hands and wingspan help him to still be effective."

"This is missing context. Bucks were also down 2-0, then 3-2. Feasting applies Giannis was getting whatever he wants, yet he lost game 2 by almost 40.  In game 7, that game was won by a couple possessions and it was Khris Middleton who hit the significant shot.   Also, Blake guarded Giannis rather well that series. Nets are the only team to take the bucks 7 and down the wire  That‚Äôs not ‚Äúfeasting‚Äù that‚Äôs barely making it out alive."
"Khris ""Khash Money"" Middleton  it fits well because he is known for his great midrange game and his jumper is money"
"I don't need to go back to watch Duncan highlights because I actually watched him play in the 2000s. You're attributing way too much of the Spurs team success to Tim Duncans basketball skills.  The Spurs were winning 60 games a season before they drafted him. And they won 60 games after he retired. This ridiculous idea that one player simply being on the team is the entire reason for their success, regardless of their performance, is silly.   Those 2000s Spurs were like the Utah Jazz last year. Unselfish, well coached team that all played defense and routinely got the #1/#2 seed.  It wasnt some mediocre cast carried by Duncan like we've seen with LeBron, Curry, even Luka, etc. He never had the offensive skill to take over a game like that   Hell in many of those Spurs years either going to the finals or winning he wasn't their leading scorer. How is Duncan's putting up 18/11 on a championship season better than Anthony Davis putting up 29/12/4/2/2 and losing in the second round.   You may as well say Khris Middleton is better than Paul George cause the Bucks won."
When the gap is big enough a disappointment crosses the threshold of a bust.   Kobe level player‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- A worse Khris Middleton is a massive bust.
"""Khris Middleton isn't any good"" (the motto of Bucks twitter before this last playoffs)"
"&gt; Khris Middleton can't be a 2nd option on a championship team  For many this is still in the ""wait and see"" department. They didn't play the Lakers, Nuggets, Clippers or Nets on their way to the championship and basically had a red carpet filled with the blood of other teams' stars and superstars on the way.  The people who said that thought they'd meet at least one contender on the way to the championship. Of course if all others self combust anybody can win it. Hell if Giannis would have been down for the entire Hawks series you could have the Hawks as NBA champions... It wouldn't prove anything."
"I mean, he had elite efficiency this last season. Very similar to Khris Middleton"
"That‚Äôs is just people wildly overrating a) how hard it is for a team who‚Äôs somewhat close to being the best in the league but not actually the best to win a title with some luck and b) how hard it actually is to be a championship 1st/2nd option if the rest of the team is good enough. Jimmy Butler got to game 6 of the Finals as the best player on his team like a year ago, it should always have been obvious Khris Middleton can definitely be a distant second best on an actual title team."
Khris Middleton can't be a 2nd option on a championship team  Honestly we all believed this but dude showed up in so many crucial moments this playoffs you gotta give him respect.

Khris Middleton lets go Leo Szn
August 12   George McGinnis or Khris Middleton.
"Why did you ignore the rest of my comment?   In the 2020 playoffs, AD averaged 28 points and 10 rebounds a game with what we can unanimously call elite defense.  Khris Middleton averaged 24 points, 7 rebounds, and 5 assists per game.   Jrue Holiday averaged 17 points, 6 rebounds and 9 assists per game with what we can call elite defense.  So sure, AD outplayed either of them individually. But their output was right there, and more speaks to the overall superior roster construction of that Bucks squad. Those 2 killed it in the playoffs even if they had off nights (as AD also infamously did, if you want to choose to remember that).  Want to know who the third leading scorer on those Lakers was? KCP, at a whopping 11 a game.  Idk, I think ignoring most of what someone says, taking things out of context and then diminishing how well a team played in order to prop someone up is pretty nephew material. I have stats backing me up, you have insults. Grow up."
"If ""only"" scoring 21 points is such a big flaw you can find in multiple playoff series in multiple years, you need to readjust your perspective. Giannis went 22.7 points, 13.5 rebounds, 5.5 assists, 1.2 steals, and 2.7 blocks per game that series. Ya I think the fact that Bledsoe scored 10.2 points a game or that Khris Middleton scored 13.7 points a game is a much bigger reason they lost that series. Klay Thompson alone scored more points per game than bot Bledsoe and Middleton combined vs the series vs OKC and if they didn't have Klay Thompson, the Thunder would have won. BTW, Curry is maybe the best scorer of all time and even he had a game that series that he scored ""only"" 19 points."
I'll try to use non-superstar examples  PG - Ricky Rubio  SG - CJ McCollum  SF - Khris Middleton  PF - Paul Millsap  C - Jonas Valanciunas
"Point Guard - playmaker, should be pass first - magic or rondo come to mind  shooting guard - scorer, shot creator - jordan and kobe come to mind, if not iverson as well, if you just want literal just scoring  &amp;#x200B;  small forward - hybrid between sg and pf, so a scoring defender comes to mind - (terrible player to use) but the likes of khris middleton come to mind. altho there could be better players, i just used the one on top of my head  pf - lanky defender and can make shots in the paint with a nice mid range stroke - timmy d, and kevin garnett come to mind, but if you want to explain it to someone currently in the league, use the likes of davis bertans, stretch 4's and great shooting.  &amp;#x200B;  c - paint beast, controls anything there both on the offense and defense - shaq comes to mind right here, even hakeem, great silky post moves."
"I noticed you only did 4 years even though they've both been in the league at least 8 years so let me finish that for you so you can shut up.   17-18 Giannis 26/4  Khris 20/4  18-19 Giannis 27/5  Khris 18/4  19-20 Giannis 29/5. Khris 20/4  20-21 Giannis 28/5. Khris 20/5  Giannis had repeatedly gotten better an Middleton has stayed average. Khris has been in the league 9 years, Giannis has been way better than him 5 of those years regardless of Middleton injury, he average 14 pts in the games he played. Offensively Giannis is better. Middleton is just a better shooter but keep believing your hype my dude."
Can't get over how low his arc is. No one shoots like that anymore. Closest is Khris Middleton
"I'm curious as to who you think the all star guards will be next year. I like Lonzo well enough but never saw him breaking into the ASG. Trae Young, Jrue Holiday, Jimmy Butler, and Khris Middleton all missed out on all star last year as potential guards. Even if you're knocking Simmons out that's a rough crew to cut from.  But it is very bold, I'll give you that."
Khris Middleton saved Buds job at like 6 different times throughout the playoffs. Man couldn‚Äôt miss in the clutch.
Honorable mention to Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday for jumping on a plane and heading over the day after they won the NBA Finals.
Khris Middleton \*
"Man I love it when Bucks fans do their best to discredit Giannis teammates to make Giannis look better. Khris averaged 24/9/4 on 52% TS in that series. Kyrie through game 3 averaged 23/5/5 on 52% TS. Khris for the series matched what healthy Kyrie did in games 1-3 but of course Giannis carried him. Khris won them game 3. Dropped 40 in game 6 and hit the OT game winner in game 7, but sure Giannis was pushed to the brink because of Khris Middleton"

"Kawhi needs a more complementary team? Did you not see KD having to leave the thunder to go play with Steph Klay and Draymond??? Kawhi took Lowry and Siakam as his two best players to win a championship.  And for the defensive competition aspect, go take a look at 2019. Kawhi averaged 30.5 ppg on 49/38/88 shooting splits while going up against defenders such as: Aaron Gordon, Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Tobias Harris, Khris Middleton, Giannis Antetokuompo, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala.  I'll wait for you to let me know when KD has ever faced that many elite defenders in one playoff run.  Also, I remember when KD was going crazy vs the Pat Beverly Clippers, people didn't seem to care about how shitty the defenders he was playing."
Best players in the league when they are hot.  1. Khris Middleton 2. Klay 3. Steph 4. KD 5. Harden  That warriors team was unfair literally any of the 3 got hot and the game might as well have ended right then.
I wanna see first option Khris Middleton so badly
"I'm not too surprised, after the top 10-15 it really depends on a few standout players which can skew the stats, 2012 had Draymond Green and Khris Middleton in the early second round and no all-star level players in the late first round.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_NBA_draft"
I half expected Perk to rank Khris Middleton higher than Giannis after all of that BS Batman/Robin narrative he pushed for months last season
This is the same guy who said Khris Middleton is the Batman on the Milwaukee Bucks.
"&gt;I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs with a fan base that loves him just as fast as ours did.  Same, but also glad he's no longer on the Lakers.  Going from watching him in college to rooting against him multiple times a year sucked. Now I can watch him and Khris Middleton slug it out for ""Aggie NBA GOAT"" with no emotional conflicts."
I guess he'll be the next Khris Middleton then   He just needs a Giannis lol
"Impact is not based on math.   However people use math to try and help determine impact.   Defence is not a 1 on 1 thing, it‚Äôs a 5v5, so despite advanced defensive metrics trying to isolate players it doesn‚Äôt do a great job (especially in comparison to how advanced offensive stats work).   And actually Khris has basically always been known as an average defender, and his defence is one of the things that was critiqued of his game.   And Klay was a top 3 defender for his position at his best.   [Google Khris Middleton defense](https://www.google.com/search?q=Khris+middleton+defense&amp;rlz=1CDGOYI_enCA912CA912&amp;hl=en-US&amp;sxsrf=AOaemvJMOikFlW-tliExDbGou2mU1b8R2w%3A1634316037130&amp;ei=Ba9pYYibB-e8ggf6jIT4DA&amp;oq=Khris+middleton+defense&amp;gs_lcp=ChNtb2JpbGUtZ3dzLXdpei1zZXJwEAMyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIGCAAQFhAeMgYIABAWEB4yBggAEBYQHjoECAAQRzoHCCMQsAIQJzoGCAAQBxAeOgYIABAIEB46BAgAEEM6BwguELEDEEM6BQgAEJECOgoILhCABBCHAhAUOgcIABCABBAKUIe3AVj_3wFg1eABaABwAXgAgAGUAYgBoxySAQQzLjI4mAEAoAEByAEEwAEB&amp;sclient=mobile-gws-wiz-serp) and see what you see:   Here are quotes from the top result which is from the Bucks subreddit;   &gt; Biggest Middleton fan in the world. But I can admit he's not great defensively. He's just too dang slow.  His size helps but he's flat footed and not quick enough.  &gt; About average. Is a slightly below average Apex wing stopper. Can battle Khawi and LeBron with not giving up position. Not going to cause them a lot of issues though. As a switch he's a solid defender. Help defense he is not negative but isn't a menace like a top off ball guys. Think Thybull or Covington as top of the tier guys there. He did a nice job on Robinson for having 0 support from Brook and that's a massive part of Miamis offense. Bucks didn't want to switch those screens.  He was really good at defence starting out, but a hamstring injury has made him a lot less mobile. As a result he is a decent defender, but nothing suggest he is an excellent defender besides how good the Bucks defence is as a whole."
"I don‚Äôt think those are fair.  More clutch? Middleton was the primary closing option on a title team. Say what you want about his play in quarters 1-3 but in the 4th he was nothing short of elite. Much better defender ? Khris is excellent 1v1 which is klays only stretch. He‚Äôs also more versatile and impactful defensively.  Consistency I agree, Middleton is highly inconsistent, but klay isn‚Äôt that consistent himself if you look at his game-to-game play. I don‚Äôt think that specifically should outweigh Middletons large advantages at inside scoring, playmaking, shot creation/ ball handling etc"
"Khris.  While in general klay is a bit overrated, this comparison should be fairly straight forward since they have similar games and roles, but Middleton is arguably better at both ends.  He‚Äôs more efficient than klay has ever been, he‚Äôs better at every aspect of scoring besides 3 point shooting which he‚Äôs still elite at, he‚Äôs a better ball handler and shot creator and playmaker, grabs more boards and now he‚Äôs solidified himself as the second option on a contender.  Defensively it‚Äôs fairly interchangeable, klay is better man to man but Middleton is very good in that department and better off ball, overall more impactful defensively and due to his size can guard more positions"
"I think Khris is a better three level scorer putting the ball on the ground, he has a better mid range, can drive better, can create for himself, get to the basket, plays good defense with size, and shows up in big time moments. He‚Äôs a better rebounder and passer than Klay. People criticize him for down games but he also closed out the Hawks without Giannis. He went bucket for bucket with KD down the stretch. Klay  is a top 5 shooter and was a great perimeter defender pre injury but he needs someone to create for him. Primarily a catch and shoot 3 point specialist (All time great at it). His finals numbers were always mediocre. He was great in game 6 against OKC where he gained his legend but if you look at his playoff series numbers he never really had a series comparable to Middleton‚Äôs against BK, ATL, or his finals avg 26+ ppg. I‚Äôm going with Middleton!"
if khris middleton isn't able to recover athletically from a hamstring injury in his prime that just proves he was never that good of an athlete.
We do 100% know that pre-injury Klay was better than Khris Middleton has ever been.
"Khris has never had the defensive impact the way Klay has though.   Klay (at his best) was a notably better defender than Khris at his best.  I would say it‚Äôs Middleton, but that‚Äôs because Klay is coming back from major injuries."
"While I feel confident it's Middleton I can see the argument for Klay and this is basically it. Klay's been incredibly consistent through the playoffs, and he's been important to his team's success there. I would nitpick 'Not to mention Klay has always been a plus defender in the playoffs.' though; Khris has also always been a significant plus defender in the playoffs."
"Depends on the team structure, Middleton is better for the Bucks than Klay would be but Klay is better for the Warriors than Khris would be. Khris has shot creating abilities that Klay doesn‚Äôt have while Klay is one of the best catch and shoot 3 point shooters of all time but isn‚Äôt as great at creating his own shots. Middleton is also craftier in the midrange imo. Thompson has the edge on defense (unless he‚Äôs declined significantly). It‚Äôs really about personal preference and fit"
"I wouldn't say does everything better. Khris averages more assists and rebounds than him. Khris is more versatile on offense, he has way more tricks in his bag than Klay. Klay is obviously the better shooter (Middleton is actually a better free throw shooter than him though) and Klay is also slightly better defender. (pre injury of course)"
Klay is better in his role. Khris is better at leading a team. We can't say the same about klay because he never had to do that. Klays game is all about playing off the ball and having curry set him up for shots. He's not a playmaker or shot creator like Middleton is. Sure the 60 points on 11 dribbles looks nice but he can't do that on his own.
pre injury? a top 2 shooter of all time with some of the nba‚Äôs most ridiculous scoring records is on the same tier as Khris Middleton? Who at one point was considered the best 2 way player in the league? Who is the perfect SG for any starting 5?  bruhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
3s off good ball movement is still sick. Contested iso threes are aids unless it's Khris Middleton.
The problem with the midrange is if you are elite at it like Khris Middleton or cp3 your point per possession are the same as an average shooter shooting threes. Of course it's better in clutch situations when you need a bucket but over the whole game or the whole season the three seems overpowered compared to the midrange shot.
"Give me B. It's like guaranteed Khris Middleton (who is great, no knock on him) vs a potential Giannis/Steph/LeBron? I'll take that risk."
"Billups has a claim for ""best guy on a championship team"" status (or at the very least, he won finals MVP). Kyrie does not. Not only that but he's never really accomplished anything in the playoffs without LeBron, whereas Chauncey clearly led or co-led multiple deep playoff runs.  Khris Middleton, Kyle Lowry, and Tyson Chandler were all the second best guy on a championship team. Doesn't mean much when the best guy is an all-time great."

"I largely expect something in line with Khris Middleton. Some of his off ball catch and shoot 3s will just be pin downs to get switches and him to hold the ball take 1 or 2 dribbles and take a pull up 17 footer. Itll get charted differently but functionally not really a big swing. That and when your 6'9 you can just run off ball actions for him to get shots off in ways most other players cant in those spots. That can kind of be his way of ""getting a bucket"" whereas for most players they need to clear out ISO"
That‚Äôs nba champion Khris Middleton to you.
"He‚Äôs Khris Middleton, but even more inconsistent"
"back atcha! Gotta love Giannis and Jrue, and ever since you all shipped out Bledsoe, there‚Äôs not really anyone on your squad I have beef with. I mean fuck Khris Middleton, but that‚Äôs just cause he drops 30 on us every time we play"
"Basketball isn‚Äôt played 1 on 1, nor is it a contest about who has the least holes in their game. Khris Middleton has fewer holes in his game than prime Shaq, who you taking?"
"For sure. Middleton was lucky in that he got a lot of burn on the tank-for-Jabari team and then also got to feature prominently when Jabari kept getting hurt. His handles/playmaking aren't great, but I'd say they are at least good (playmaking more than handles maybe), and I think a lot of that can be credited to him getting the ball in his hands a lot on low-expectation teams.  If we had been fighting for a championship, or we were trying to develop Jabari into a superstar, or if Giannis was already a superstar in those days... Khris could have played, but he would have been relegated to a stand-in-the-corner 3&amp;D guy. Which he'd be fine at, but there are better shooters out there; it's Khris's completeness to his game that makes him so great. I could definitely see Nwora being similar in that regard. I hope he can get the chance to develop because I don't think he's valuable to us as a trade asset"
‚ÄúcAdEs FlOoR iS kHrIs MiDdLeToN‚Äù - literally the draft special guys
"Allen, re-signed Portis, Nworas been doing very good, Rodney Hood(I think is coming back from an injury so we will see) Semi Ojeleye and might be more I can‚Äôt remember off the top of my head. Oh and Donte should be back.   May not sound like much but it‚Äôs not uncommon for people to come here and look noticeably better than they did on previous teams (Portis for example).   Plus Khris and Jrue could always shoot better next time we face them, that was our issue when Kyrie went down. Aside from game 6, Middleton and Jrue were pretty bad offensively that series."
Khris Middleton was good enough to be a number two option on a championship team!
"Chauncey Billups, Ben Wallace, Kyle Lowry &amp; Khris Middleton"
Khris Middleton
&gt;F - Domantas Sabonis (IND)  &gt;F - Giannis Antetokounpo (IND)  &gt;F - Khris Middleton (IND)  this is great news for pacers fans!
sorry but khris middleton he looks like a fucking goldfish
"1. Ben Wallace 2. Rip Hamilton 3. Chauncey Billups\* 4. Rasheed Wallace 5. Tayshaun Prince  Honorable mentions : Antonio McDyess, Russell Westbrook, Joe Johnson, Khris Middleton, Hakeem Olajuwon  \*I'll admit I'm very bothered by the allegations we've seen this offseason, and if proven guilty he'll be off that least"
"I would be surprised if he develops anything like Middleton. Khris is way more of a complete player and always was even at a younger age. Nwora‚Äôs scoring and shooting are the only thing he really does at a high level, I see Nwora as the prototypical scoring 6th man that doesn‚Äôt do much else."
"Only counting players I had actually watched. Note, I don't have an exact order of my all time favorite players in my head, so I'm just thinking of players off the top of my head.  1: Giannis Antetokounmpo   2: Derrick Rose  3: Steph Curry  After these 3, it gets really difficult. Kawhi was probably one of them before his whole Spurs controversy, but whatever.   I don't know who's my 4th and 5th favorite players are. Probably someone of the following:  \- Joakim Noah  \- Khris Middleton  \- Dirk Nowitzki  \- Tim Duncan"
"Fred last year (20/6/4) put up similar numbers as Khris Middleton (18/4/5), D'Angelo Russell (21/7/4), Kyle Lowry (19/7/5), and Kemba Walker (20/5/4) in years they were All Stars.    Fred is also one of the best guard defenders in the league and has shot 38% from 3 while taking 8 attempts per game over the past 2 seasons.    Fred is super underated and absolutely deserves to be called a fringe All Star."
"One of our biggest problem is offensive consistency. Giannis is pretty much a constant threat but even in this championship run, Jrue and Middleton were Katy Perry‚Äôs hit song ‚Äòhot N cold‚Äô all postseason.  Our inside defense was always really good, and I don‚Äôt think Capella is a substantial enough difference on brook to really warrant the spacing nightmare he would bring. Vucevic on the other  hand, would decrease our defensive efficiency a bit (but it would still be great with Giannis, Khris and Jrue), but increase our offensive output significantly, with a consistent 3pt and low post scoring option that can offset Giannis‚Äô increased defensive load in this system."
Khris Middleton and Lebron‚Äôs hairlines
"It used to be controversial a few years ago but it shouldn‚Äôt be controversial now, especially after the finals  Khris Middleton &gt; DeMar DeRozan"
Khris Middleton &gt; Devin Booker
He only took 3.3 threes a game the Bucks just shot pretty bad all around. Jrue shot 30%. PJ shot 32%. Brook Lopez shot 32%. Khris Middleton shot 34.3%
"Unrealistic. There‚Äôd have to be at least 4 more teams in this deal. LeBron, Khris Middleton, Luka and Trae Young would be involved"
"LeBron James plays 40 games, Austin Rivers plays 82, Khris Middleton plays 58, how do you rank those players for that season? See, availability isn't how you grade the skill level of a player, it can only grade the impact they had on the team during the stretch you set out to look at, and even then availability only matters to an extent.  But regardless, this post isn't asking who was better last year, it's asking you to rank the players. Get your head out of your ass."
"CP3 is the best PG in the NBA, and Khris Middleton is the best SF. Plenty of NBA GMs [agree with me](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nba.com/news/2021-22-gmsurvey%3famp=1).  See how bad that logic is?"
Because Jrue and Middleton were horrible that series and were playing like roleplayers. Giannis had the bigger names but they were only marginally better than than Kds teammates. Make no mistake if we even had an average Jrue or Khris not even them at their very best we win that series in 5 lol
khris middleton is in a weird spot where he‚Äôs actually underrated but there are people who severely overrate him to slight giannis
Khris Middleton.
"He had a career year but its a long season. The top 4 teams in the bubble all played poorly. It's just that the Heat are less talented than the Lakers, Boston and Nuggets so Jimmy had to do more hard carrying and Bucks just focused everything into stopping him. To buck's credit, they threw Giannis, PJ Tucker, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday at him at all times."
Tbh I think a team of   John Stockton  Joe Dumars  Khris Middleton  Shawn Marion  Rudy Gobert  Could compete with basically any all time lineup despite having 0 total 1st place MVP votes among those players. I think when most people put together all time teams they put 4-5 1st option scorers with redundant skill sets and don‚Äôt pay enough attention to things line defense and efficiency that scale much more than volume scoring.  I would honestly take the above team over something like AI-Kobe-MJ-Lebron-Shaq that‚Äôs got a lot of volume scoring but poor spacing and a defensive liability.
"Fair point, my only response is that maybe management thought the coaching change would unlock something. Philly is definitely liable due to the contract but that‚Äôs also a symptom of non-coastal markets having to overpay for their mid-tier players   I would say Middleton is similar‚Äî we knew we had to pay him because we weren‚Äôt gonna find another player like him that was willing to play in MKE for less. It obviously worked out a lot better for us because Khris is clearly a harder worker and improves every year"
Khris Khash 'Michael Jordan' Money Middleton
Nobody gives credit to Khris Middleton? He was hitting big shots to help his team win the championship.
He was but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be easy to replace his defensive role so easily. A good wing defender that has negative offense isn‚Äôt all that valuable on its own but for us the defense is huge because it allows Middleton to focus on being the 2nd option offensively. We don‚Äôt want Khris guarding KD 40 minutes a night then having him carry a big load offensively. I‚Äôm not sure we have the solution on the roster right now so hopefully that‚Äôs something we can fix at the deadline or on the buyout market.
Because Khris Middleton would also be pretty high on the list of guys to take a final shot.
"Maybe I'm just undervaluing him because of the current trade environment surrounding him. Perhaps that's on Morey though and not the rest of the league. I can see that he's an amazing player in the regular season but I've just never seen him play at the same level in the postseason. Admittedly though, you've most likely watched a lot more of those games then I.  As far as Ayton, if I was a Suns fan, I wouldn't be in a rush to max him right away. Yes, they made a finals run but they also ran into injured teams all the way there. I'd rather see them wait until after next season's playoffs, so they can be sure it wasn't a fluke, and handle it in restricted free agency.  That's just me though because I've been in pain, watching bad trades and cap management since 2009. Ben Gordon, Charlie Villanueva, Josh Smith, Blake Griffin, who still counts towards $30 million of our cap this year. I mean, we traded Khris Middleton as filler salary for Brandon Jennings and he was just the 2nd or 3rd best player on the championship team."
Khris Middleton and Tobias Harris have entered the chat
"Bobby Portis didn't have any impact on the series whatsoever. Kyle Lowry is better than Jrue Holiday in every aspect (except defense and even then Kylr Lowry is not too far behind), so I expect him to have the same impact Jrue had for the Bucks. Giannis only had one game where he scored at least 30 points. All Brook Lopez did was camp under the rim when Bam was scared to shoot, but I expect Bam to take those shots this time around and pull Lopez out of the paint. Bam has the speed advantage then. Khris Middleton did have good series. Grayson Allen is not going to be the difference maker in a two peat."
"He's getting overrated a bit. He needed Khris Middleton multiple times in his championship run because he couldn't score from the perimeter. He has obvious limitations in his game that could have been exploited by any healthy contending team. I would still take KG, Dirk, Barkley and Malone no question above him. Maybe I'll change my mind when he can beat a healthy Nets or Lakers team."
You keep trying to discredit him like it wasn‚Äôt impressive. That Celtics team was more talented than the Cavs. They won 55 games and let‚Äôs not pretend they had a easy 1st round opponent. They got taken to 7 games by Giannis &amp; Khris Middleton. They had more better players than the Cavs but LeBron made all the difference. Even in the context of a weak east it was still super impressive.
Lebron DeAaron Fox Westbrook Curry Khris Middleton Jokic are players games' I enjoy watching the most
Yeah why is Kyrie there on that list? It‚Äôs like a list with   1. Wilt Chamberlain   2. Magic Johnson  3. Larry Bird  4. Kareem Abdul Jabbar   5. Khris Middleton  At least Khris is the second best player on his squad.
"It 100% depends on the system around you. I‚Äôm just pointing to the countless attempts at super teams that have flopped while the only outliers I can recall are the Heat, Cavs and Warriors. Let‚Äôs point to the Sixers 3 seasons ago against the Raptors. Simmons and Lowry were around the same level at the time, Redick was better than Danny Green, Kawhi was better than Butler, Harris was arguably better than Siakam at the time and Embiid was obviously better than Gasol. The team put together 4 guys who were all star players and put him next to a sniper from range. They still lost though. You could argue they lost by lucky last shot which is fair, but it shouldn‚Äôt have got to that point to begin with based on talent on that roster. You‚Äôre right in saying good coaching does wonders and I agree, but what if you replaced Jimmy with a guy like Khris Middleton, who can shoot from anywhere, doesn‚Äôt always need the ball in his hands, and is great on defence as well. Then have someone like Jerami Grant or Aaron Gordon at the 4 instead of Tobias. I personally think that team would‚Äôve been way better than the one the Sixers had constructed. Despite the three maybe not being as good of players as the players previously on the team, their fit is better and the coaches job becomes easier."
"Nah, absolutely not, no. They had Giannis who is the most dominant finisher in the last 15 years, Jrue Holiday arguably the best 3&amp;D guard in the NBA, Khris Middleton who is arguably one of the best all around wings in the NBA, and a supporting cast of extremely solid role players like Bobby Portis and PJ Tucker. This is just incorrect."
The son of Khris Middleton and Flava Flav
"Eh, I'm comfortable in saying Khris Middleton is guilty of sometimes jumping into a defender if he gets his man off his feet."
Using SI's rankings which has Ben at 21:  PG Jamal Murray  SG Donovan Mitchell  SF Khris Middleton  PF Ben Simmons  C Zion Williamson  **Bench**  Russell Westbrook  Kyle Lowry  Trae Young  Jaylen Brown  Brandon Ingram  Nikola Vucevic  Kristaps Porzingis
Khris Middleton and arguably Holiday are better
"Jrue Holiday, C.J. McCollum, Khris Middleton, Simmons, Porzingis"
"Someone was trying to tell me how Khris Middleton is better than Klay (pre-injury was specified) and ""it's not even close.""  It really goes to show you how much winning influences the way players are perceived. And I like Middleton but peak to peak? Klay's better and it's not really close."
Definitely seen Khris Middleton do this
Khris Middleton would be awesome for the Warriors.
"Really Bucks, Raptors, or Sixers could have knocked off the injured Warriors.   We were a Khris Middleton 3 away from going up 3-0 on you guys (which probably means we win the series), Sixers were a bounce away from going to OT with y'all, and obviously you went and won the damn thing.   Three really really good teams"
Lol people downvoting. Gobert gets abused in the playoffs. The 25th best playoff player is probably like Jaylen Brown or Khris Middleton or KAT and I'd take all them over Rudy.
Khris Middleton melts steel beams.
Is Middleton not a star? Bro was the second option &amp; closer on a championship team  Cade is a better passer than Khris and could be even better defensively
Khris Middleton would never.
"Butler didn't have a lot of offensive help and had Giannis, PJ tucker, Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday on him at any given time. If the bucks had to worry about defending Embiid instead, I think that might change things"
Don't compare Klay Thompson to Khris Middleton...
How does Harris deserve blame? At times it seemed like he was the only Sixer besides Embiid to show up. That's like blaming Luol Deng for the Bulls losing the ECF in 2011 or Khris Middleton for the Bucks' losses in the playoffs before this year.
"To be fair Jimmy faced crazy competition with not much offensive help. Butler had Giannis, PJ Tucker, Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton on him at any given time. Bam also played incredibly small with his passiveness on offence."
Klay Thompson (Booker) Isaiah Thomas (CP3) David Robinson (Ayton) Khris Middleton (Bridges) Shane Battier (Crowder)   Off the bench   Devin Harris (Payne) Doug McDermott (Johnson) Andrew Bynum (McGee) Greivis V√°squez (Shamet) Nenad Krstiƒá (Kaminsky)  Yeah I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs a pretty good team.

"Do you remember Giannis being unable to score on James Harden?? The bucks were getting smacked by 30 lmfao, before kyrie went down. He's also a terrible free throw shooter and can't create his own shot. It took some insane clutch performances by Khris Middleton to save the bucks' ass against the nets"
"As a Bucks fan who has seen Khris Middleton grow in his career, it's really easy to look at guys and be like  ""well he could be a Khris Middleton some day""  Any wing who has decent size, defense, and shooting touch. Like, Khris has never had elite athleticism and doesn't have quite the automatic 3-pt shot that his reputation leads one to think.. so it's easy to picture any promising young player potentially blossoming into an all-star like him.  Your Royce O'Neals, Garry Harrises, Mikal Bridgeses... those types of guys. Most role players never ascend to that next level, and usually it's just a skill/confidence/opportunity thing, so it sucks that Gary had to deal with injuries because he probably had as good of a shot at making the leap as any of the guys I named"
"&gt;However beneath these numbers alot of questions pop up, his numbers were amazing however he was only just above league efficiency  He had below average to average spacing for most of his career and in his prime was 3%+ over league average on amazing volume.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;His playoff success is overblown by how compared to other greats he doesn't have too many amazing finals moments with more lows than highs (Khris Middleton has a better peak finals game than Kobe) and his numbers dip from regular season to playoffs quite sharply.  Now I see why you dont know how to rank him. You look at numbers and not context. Not only is it completely false that Middleton had a better finals game peak than Kobe...its misleading to say his numbers drop sharply in the playoffs.  He faced more top 10 defenses than any other player in NBA history. He faced more -5 DRTG teams in the playoffs than any other player in NBA history. His numbers are actually better across the board in the playoffs because his competition was absurdly good for much of his career (2000s West was the best conference ever) in the playoffs compared to regular season.   &gt;As a teammate he is known as both being clutch with ""mamba mentality"" yet his numbers are dwarfed by players who are considered softer.  This factors into your ranking? Narratives?"
"Kobe Bryant imo is quite hard to rank all time.  Based on reputation, stats and accolades he is a top 5 player or top 10 player all time. Plus other players view him as a slightly worse Jordan who'd rip hearts out on the court and annihilate any competition in the way.  However beneath these numbers alot of questions pop up, his numbers were amazing however he was only just above league efficiency, multiple accolades in regards to all star selections and all defensive nods were 100% based on legacy in the latter half of his career.  His playoff success is overblown by how compared to other greats he doesn't have too many amazing finals moments with more lows than highs (Khris Middleton has a better peak finals game than Kobe) and his numbers dip from regular season to playoffs quite sharply.  As a teammate he is known as both being clutch with ""mamba mentality"" yet his numbers are dwarfed by players who are considered softer. He is also well known as being a terrible teammate who belittles others for no valid reason yet some consider this a positive trait.   If starting your own team from scratch some people would list 15-20 players above Kobe yet some legitimately view him as either the GOAT or top 3 at worst."
You think 2009 or 2010 cavs with Khris Middleton wouldn't be able to beat that Suns team?  You're out of your mind imo
"Lmao ‚Äúaverage starter‚Äù you‚Äôre on crack, he may not be a ‚Äústar‚Äù or an all star but to act like he‚Äôs on the level of what would be ‚Äúaverage‚Äù, which is the 4th or 5th starting man on every team, is just a braindead take.  Average starters don‚Äôt put up 19 a game shooting 38% from 3 on 5 attempts a game.  Unless you consider Khris Middleton an average starter‚Ä¶."
"You would be replacing JR in the starting lineup with Khris Middleton, idk if they win it but it goes 7 in my opinion"
Khris Middleton last season's playoffs were butt clenching.
"That‚Äôs the thing. It‚Äôs clear that Jimmy isn‚Äôt a #1 option. He‚Äôs a Khris Middleton with better defense, a worse jumper, but a **lot** of leadership. If he‚Äôs your number two guy behind a clear cut #1 (Giannis/Embiid, both who are amazing on defense) you‚Äôve got a solid squad.   Sixers really fucked up in not retaining him and not trying to trade Ben for Harden."
Yes Khris Middleton‚Äôs game translates extremely well to that era of mid range shooting.  Mid-range scoring is one of the few things Khris Middleton is absolutely elite at in the league. His baseline jumper has been the most efficient in the league like 3 years running. His offense would absolutely be a huge weight off Bron‚Äôs shoulders
"Yeah this is my thought on it too. I think he makes more finals (probably 3 or 4 total) in those 7 years, but still loses because the west teams were all very very good and well rounded teams. I just thought this would be an interesting discussions using someone like Middleton because his game is so up and down in the playoffs and LeBron had pretty terrible teammates his entire time. I would be curious to see though if LeBron knew he could focus more energy on defense on nights when Khris had it, would that have helped any in some series."
No  Khris Middleton ain‚Äôt fixing a sweep and the league got even stronger since 2007
Khris Middleton is litterally the most hit or miss playoff performer he either plays like shit or like MJ
He was above average. Khris Middleton was really good. Jaylen Brown was really good.
"Luka ""Khris Middleton"" Doncic"
"I know Ray Allen only spent 6 seasons in Milwaukee but you can really see how the league has shifted when Khris Middleton is about to overtake someone considered one of the greatest shooters in the history of the game. Same things happening here in Chicago, Zach in his 5th season here has just surpassed MJs made 3s over the course of 13 seasons"
Reminds me of the Khris Middleton [trading cards](https://imgur.com/a/UZg6Tl7)
Should we be worried about Khris Middleton?
I look at Cade Cunningham and I see young Khris Middleton
"Jump shooters do carry forward momentum. Most shooters sway, so their feet land forward instead of landing back where they jumped. Most shooters don‚Äôt land in the same spot they jumped. I vividly remember Khris Middleton getting fouled on a 3pt shot in the season opener where he landed about 3 ft from where he jumped."
Khris ‚ÄúKhash Money‚Äù Middleton is one of my favorites
Lebron played more games than Giannis that year and had the top seed in the harder conference. The pandemic starting at the exact time of Giannis' injury and the Bucks weird sudden drama (Bud was benching Khris Middleton and Brook Lopez) while being on a losing streak completely screwed Lebron out of MVP and secured it for Giannis.
Plenty of shooters shot poorly in the bubble. Khris Middleton and Paul George for example.
"Uh, what? Dame missed the last 2 or so games with injury and nurkic had 8 games prior to shake the rust off after missing a full season of basketball with a gruesome injury.  Russ was rushed back from a major leg injury that kept him out against okc and played abhorrently as a result. That same injury he played through was affecting him at the start of the next season with Washington...  And I couldn‚Äôt care less about if you blew out Miami in a game. The fact is early on their secondary leading scorer and their defensive anchor, who were 2 of the teams top 3 players, got injured. Both missed about 2 games and both were fractions of themselves once they returned, and they still pushed LAL to 6.  You can‚Äôt call yourself unbiased and then completely ignore all LAL‚Äôs injury luck lmfao.   There‚Äôs an old saying, a series doesn‚Äôt start until one team loses a home game. Brooklyn won both their home games. Then the bucks won both of their home games. And again your Atlanta point is complete nonsense. They started off the hawks series 2-1, not 1-2, and when Trae  got hurt, giannis got hurt as well...   Every point you‚Äôre making is wrong in some way lmfao. And this is WITHOUT mentioning the fact that AD had the best player in the league at his side spoon feeding him east buckets while giannis had the embodiment of inconsistency with khris middleton who had a fraction of lebrons ability"
"They definitely got a long time to figure it out.  I mean, it took Giannis and Khris Middleton 8 years. Their draft picks this year: Green, KPJ, Sengun and Garuba are going to be monsters by that time."
"while I do think its too early to determine what cade will end up as, bringing up Khris Middleton specifically is hilarious considering the pistons drafted him and traded him to milwaukee for 3 years of brandon jennings"
"In my opinion, Mobley was the number one pick. He was putting up numbers similar to AD. Cade is more Khris Middleton than Luka Doncic in my opinion.   Jalen Green is good but he doesn't have the playmaking to be the number one offensive star. None of the draft picks do but Mobley can definitely be the number one defensive star for a team."
"Tbf I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a superstar prospect, but I also think he won‚Äôt be worse than a solid role player.   He has a high floor, so it depends on what you perceive a bust to be from a number one pick.   Personally I think mobley and Barnes will be better than him, and not because of recency bias.  I don‚Äôt see enough of a handle to offset the lack of athleticism, nor is he a good finisher or lead playmaker. Don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll ever be an elite offensive engine.   Now I could see him becoming as good as Khris Middleton, but that could be perceived as a bust depending on how the guys selected below him are."
He's literally mirroring Khris Middleton. There's still a pause when he hits his apex but that stop margin is getting thinner and thinner by the day.
"i just think evan turner is low, khris middleton is fair though just not the superstar some expect  i think turner if he was a lot better is a fair comp though"
Khris Middleton is a pretty fucking good ceiling.  But I do get an Evan Turnerish feeling from this guy
His ceiling is Khris Middleton and thats if everything goes right. I think hes slightly better Evan Turner. I know a bust when I see one.
I think Khris Middleton is in contention for that one.
Cade Cunningham at his best will be lucky to be as good as Khris Middleton. How did this unathletic dude who isn't a great passer (as evidenced by his mediocre ast/to number throughout his career) go no. 1 overall in a stacked draft?
Khris Middleton On Giannis Antetokounmpo-Justin Robinson Friendship: ‚ÄúThey Sit Next To Each Other In The Locker Room. They Go Out To Dinners. Dates And Stuff.‚Äù
"I mean, Khris Middletone would not have turned into Khris Middleton if he stayed with the pistons. Same for Dinwiddie. That decade was a fucking black hole for us. Also when we traded him he'd only played like 30 ish games off the bench and never really shined. Honestly Khris should be thankful we traded him before he had to suffer Stan Van Gundy. We saved that man's career in the most lateral ass round about way lol"
I thought about this before the season started and I think the rhetoric will really ramp up over the coming days. Players will get used to it but this isn't a new thing. I think Khris Middleton a few years ago had noted trouble shooting the FIBA ball during one of the international runs.  I am sure there will be research showing that the ball could be a contributing factor to the low numbers.
"Yes you can?  Rookie Luka was worse than Khris Middleton that year, but nobody would have argued if you said Luka's ceiling was higher than Middleton's.  Kendrick Nunn was on an All-Rookie that RJ Barrett wasn't on, but you'd be crazy saying he had a higher ceiling."
"I mean, exactly - if they didn't want the Bucks to bully them they wouldn't have given us Khris Middleton."
"Y'all can't shit on the Pistons too much, they gave you Khris Middleton for free after all."
Poor mans Khris Middleton
Kinda insulting to Khris Middleton. Giannis definitely did not do it alone. He had a lot of help
"TS% and FG% are different, that doesn't make one better. TS% is best for evaluating how well a player shoots separate from all other aspects of the game. FG% is better for determining how many of your shots give the opponent an opportunity to get a rebound (which is just about every time because defensive rebounds are far more common). Giannis's shots give less of these possession opportunities to opposing teams, but KD has more points per make. Scoring cannot be defined in one all-encompassing stat.  And to the Khris/Jrue point, healthy does not equal playing well. They weren't shooting well, so they weren't as useful as people make them out to be in this series. I don't care how healthy they were if they shot that poorly. If the corpse of James Harden is a good excuse, then the disease-ridded-but-still-moving bodies of Middleton and Holliday are too. Injured or not, Giannis didn't get the help people say he did."
Giannis is that good he‚Äôs making people think that having Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday alongside him equates to being a superteam.
"""Breaking: Khris Middleton out with explosive diarrhea"""
"*Khris Middleton out with crabs*  Asked to comment on the matter, Mike Budenholzer said ""Khris is itching to come back as soon as he can"""
"Bobby Portis, Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, Donte Divincenzo are all out on a SEGABABA."
"Middleton and Holiday deserve the max from Milwaukee because they had the #1 player and surrounding pieces already. There's an opportunity cost to giving people max contracts because of how the NBA works and it made sense for the bucks.  Let's say hypothetically that Jrue and Khris both were FA next year and both went to the cavs and said ""we want to play for you."" Would you be happy if the cavs dumped a ton of picks to get rid of Love to make room and also traded away Allen to make room?  Players like Lowry, Holiday, etc, are on a small tier below 'real' max contract players that have very different value based on the team. If KD rang a GM and said ""just make cap space and I'll sign,"" you make cap space for him. Same thing with Jokic, Giannis, Luka, Steph, Lebron.   When you say ""Most contenders have 3 max guys,"" it's because the way the NBA works means that there's someone out there that may only get a near max from other teams that you can get by promising them a full max, and you need him to win a championship. But if you sign that guy before you get your #1 then you're wasting money (or you like to go all in when you have 2-3-4-5 and need a 6 to pull a straight on the last card)."
Lol have you even been watching games Giannis has been hooping Khris is the one who‚Äôs turning into Brick Middleton
"I think he could be a good playmaking wing, would probably be less TO prone if he didn't have to be his team's primary playmaker.  I saw a stat that he turned the ball over on 34% of his transition possessions in college.  So maybe getting a PG next to him that can push in transition and letting him work as a halfcourt scorer would be best.  Like, a 3&amp;D guy that becomes a halfcourt iso scorer (cause he was good at those iso jumpers in college) and that runs wing PnRs could be really valuable.  Like a smaller version of Tatum maybe, perhaps more passing and less scoring oriented.  Or like a much earlier blooming version of Khris Middleton.  I'd feel a lot better about him if he was actually 6'8"" though, cause then you are comparing him to SFs and less offensively skilled players.  If he has to be a guard, he is much less of a mismatch and his lack of quickness and ability to blow by guys is a much bigger problem."

"So part of iso scoring isnt just the ppp but I get your point. Lowry was our best iso scorer even if he didnt have the highest ppp, you kno why? The game in the clutch is generally half court, you need a shot to close a game or be elite in the post. Giannis had his khris middleton. So if it wasnt lowry, it was fvv, siakam was the third guy. I do understand the argument for norm, but his ball iq isnt the best for isolation scoring tbh. Thats why a combination of half court offense, ball iq, is what ppp doesnt encompass fully. That why you should just look at the game itself for half court offense, an indicator of iso scoring."
"Lol what, of course he‚Äôs a starter, I never claimed otherwise. He‚Äôs nowhere near an All Star though. What the fuck are you talking about? You‚Äôre bringing up All Stars in 2013 like that shit matters but apparently now you‚Äôre worried about current ability? Because on current ability, Khris Middleton is the one and only other All Star on the Bucks and has been for Giannis‚Äô entire tenure.  Giannis lead the team in 4th quarter points by a huge margin, Jrue wasn‚Äôt responsible for closing at all. Middleton did, especially in that game 7 (13 points on 5/10 in the 4th/OT to Giannis‚Äô 9 points on 4/5, take your pick I guess) but if he‚Äôd not shot **4/16** in the first three quarters we wouldn‚Äôt have needed a closer. As for defence, not so much against the Nets. Once Kyrie went down it was KD vs. the world, and PJ was on him. Jrue was mostly guarding crippled Harden and Khris was mostly guarding guys like Jeff Green and Joe Harris. Jrue‚Äôs defence was big in the ECF and Finals for sure, not so much the first two rounds."
I love bam and Lowry but I would take Jrue and Middleton if I could. Defensively you could probably say they were better than Jrue and Khris but not offensively. I think I‚Äôd take Jrue of Lowry defense wise anyways
"I think the main problem is when Giannis plays the C, they need a competent PF to fill in. Portis is exactly that, and so was PJ. Semi Ojeleye/Pat Connaughton/Khris Middleton at the 4 however..."
&gt; Giannis and Middleton desperately need some help.  Let's not let Khris off the hook here. 19 points on 21 shots is pretty awful.  Khris isn't stepping up either.
&gt; If Middleton can be a strong #2  List of championship number 2s in reverse chronological order:  2020: anthony davis  2019: pascal siakam  2018: durant or curry  2017: durant or curry  2016: kyrie  2015: klay or dray  2014: kawhi or tony parker  2013: wade  2012: wade  2011: tyson chandler  2010: pau gasol  2009: pau gasol  2008: kg or pierce  2007: tony parker  2006: shaq  2005: tony parker or manu  2004: sheed or billups  2003: stephen jackson??  2002: kobe  2001: kobe  2000: kobe  I think 2003 would be the only year khris would have a strong argument for being the 2nd best player
He‚Äôs a young and efficient wing scorer who provides decent playmaking for his position. I‚Äôm not sure why that doesn‚Äôt make him a good enough 2.   Khris Middleton just won a chip. Ingram could easily eclipse Middleton even with the defensive difference.

Khris Middleton
"They would (for good reason, Bird and Magic would still dominate in today‚Äôs game), but if you said Khris Middleton would be first team All-NBA there would probably be agreement"
You say this like it should be common sense but is it? If I said 2021 Khris Middleton is a better basketball player than 1981 Larry Bird dont you think the majority of this sub is going to call me an idiot?
"Gobert would not help the Mavs at all, because he always gets killed at the highest levels since he cannot score.   Middleton is absolutely the correct answer. Khris is one of the most underrated players in the league. A solid defender, he cuts nicely off ball, he shoots well AND he is completely capable of taking over and getting your own shot. Khris Middleton is what philly fans think Tobias Harris is.  Luka and Khris have a similar chance to Giannis and Khris; the difference being that the Bucks need a point guard, and the Mavs would need a rim protector there. Gobert fits in that situation I suppose, if you want to go Studs and Duds and have 3 max players.   But the KP trade was a horrendous mistake that has been partially mitigated by THJR being awesome; however, the Mavs look ready to compound on the mistake by overpaying THJR and making his contributions significantly less valuable.   Luka is so good and so young; honestly, the smartest thing to do for the future of Dallas is to trade Literally everyone over 25 on the roster for as much value as you can get. But that won't happen.  Dirk 2.0 is on the table if the Mavs don't get help. Aka...one real title run."
"I get what people are saying, he can't carry a team.  But would you not say that when he and KD went to Brooklyn it was a superstar pairing? They were a championship threat and called a ""superteam"" long before Harden joined.  It wasn't even comparable to, for example, Giannis and Khris Middleton (also an all-star 2nd option) nobody ever called the Milwaukee Bucks a Big 2 team. Just saying Kyrie is levels above another all-star guard it's fair to call him a superstar"
"Just a reminder, Jason Kidd once had Khris Middleton intentionally miss a free throw when they were up 3 because he was worried about a 4 point play.   He also had a player intentionally foul up 4 with under ten seconds left because ""we are better at the free throw game than them"""
"If we‚Äôre considering mid-range shooting, that can I interest you in one Mr. Khris ‚Äúhesi step-back 360 no-scope Middy fade-away jimbo‚Äù Middleton?"
I support Khris Middleton. I want him to pop off so more people know why Celtic fans see him as the boogeyman.
That's a funny way of spelling Khris Middleton.
I wore my Giannis city jersey and Khris Middleton saw me and yelled ‚ÄúDamn why don‚Äôt you have my jersey!?‚Äù So you could say were best friends.
Giannis is also the only guy in the top 15 that needs to defer to Khris Middleton when it‚Äôs a half-court playoff game and he can‚Äôt just run into 3 guys and dunk.
"the unfortunate part is that I am not sure what's out there for them that makes them better.  The only young pieces they have are Simons &amp; Zach Collins, neither of whom hold a lot of value.  In theory maybe you can package those guys with the Derrick Jones Jr. contract for another veteran wing player but it's really tough to find an available player that moves the needle for them.  I don't know what you are getting for CJ McCollum (you could think about someone like Khris Middleton but the Bucks probably aren't interested) that makes the team better and Nurkic is expiring and I don't know how much value he has either.  Powell is a free-agent, maybe the team brings him back or maybe they can S&amp;T him to his preferred destination for something good."
He gets paid superstar money because no one is coming to Portland. Same reason Khris Middleton got paid. Portland needs to get a steal in the draft or hope to possibly make a signing. They don‚Äôt have the correct pieces to trade for another superstar player
Kuzma is a poor man khris Middleton
Did Khris Middleton get taller?
"Hoping we can do it with Khris Middleton as our third best player, can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm overly optimistic"
Fact: Khris Middleton is shooting 114% against Celtics the last 3 seasons
I think Khris Middleton will be a deciding factor for the Bucks. They need the Khris Middleton that absolutely fucks us every single time we play them.
Broke: the Nets won the series because their roster is far superior and faced a depleted Celtics team  Woke: the Celtics intentionally lost to avoid playing against Khris Middleton for an entire series
"Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton says no"
"I dont think so.  Jrue would be boderline and Middleton isnt there. No franchise would even think about having Khris as their #1 guy.   But that's okay! People get too hung up on calling something a ""Big 3"". The Bucks can absolutely beat the Nets- Big 3 or not."
That‚Äôs not the issue though. Everyone knows he‚Äôs a good player with excellent athletic and physical attributes. The question is would you throw a maximum contract his way? We are talking something in the range of 4yr/$120mil.  That‚Äôs pretty much committing to MPJ as one of your ‚Äústar‚Äù players when he‚Äôs only two shortened years removed from a devastating back injury and some inconsistent play. Let‚Äôs not ignore that MPJ has been yanked in and out of games due to questionable basketball IQ plays and low defensive effort pretty consistently over his career.  Is he a really efficient athletic perimeter player? Absolutely. But how much of that is Jokic  and the DEN offensive system creating high percentage looks for him? I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs quite a bit considering much of his scoring comes off of dribble hand offs and catch and shoot opportunities. Is he the type of player that you can call an ISO for and be comfortable that he can create for himself/others? Probably not yet.  That‚Äôs a lot of money and years to be committing to a player who offensively profiles a lot like a more injury prone Khris Middleton (who has developed but did receive much scrutiny when MIL maxed him).
"Just 4-5 years ago this team would've killed  C: Rudy Gobert / DeAndre Jordan / Clint Capella / Jusuf Nurkic  PF: Kevin Love / Serge Ibaka / Zach Randolph  SF: Jae Crowder / Tim Hardaway Jr. / Khris Middleton  SG: Klay Thompson / Buddy Hield / Gary Harris  PG: Jrue Holiday / Tony Parker  Love, Holiday, Klay and Gobert were all all star level players in '16-18"

Every night before getting into bed I check underneath for Khris Middleton.
Khris Middleton still going under the radar...  22/7/4 on 48/41/89
"Khris Middleton is flat out one of the most underrated dudes in the league. He‚Äôs averaged 21/6/5 on 49/41/91 the last two seasons with good defense. He‚Äôs not close to the best player in the league, but he has so few weaknesses. I think he, giannis and Jrue make a great big 3 worthy of a championship that still isn‚Äôt a super team"
"Forbes isn't good defensively by any means, but the things Khris Middleton did to Duncan Robinson this series whenever he tried to guard him were just gross.  He was played off the floor finally today."
Shoutout to Khris Middleton for not getting himself suspended for game 1
"*Laughs in Khris ""Celtic killer"" Middleton*"

No disrespect Khris Middleton is funny looking
How are you gonna get mad at Khris fucking Middleton
"The Bucks have a great defense to handle Jimmy, and Brook Lopez pitching a tent in the paint. Context matters. Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, Giannis, PJ Tucker, Donte Divicenzo, and Brook committing a defensive 3 seconds every possessions will kill any star without a 3pt shot."

"Jrue is so much better than Bledsoe  The Bucks aren't stupidly isoing Giannis on stagnant mid post isos for 30 times per game, and run more actions trough Middleton and Jrue : it's also about Bledsoe, who was a hiding place for Dragic/Herro/Robinson, now one of those guys has to guard Khris or Jrue  Ariza isn""t as strong as Crowder he can't guard Giannis  Giannis guarding Butler  Lopez being much better on Bam than last year/The Buck being ready for Miami's handoff game  The Bucks have more reliable shooters than last year, which makes it harder to create the wall"
Jamal Murray  Paul George  CJ McCollum  Anthony Davis  Brandon Ingram  Christian Wood  Kevin Durant / James Harden  Khris Middleton  Jaylen Brown  Russell Westbrook  Caris Levert  Nikola Vucevic  All averaged more PPG than KP
"You deeply, fundamentally misunderstand the reverence and awe he insipires in us.   Mr. Khris Middleton, sir, is never spoken of on our sub in anything the most polite, respectful tones. I know he's not the boogeyman for the entire league, but he's OUR boogeyman.   I still don't turn out the lights at night until I've checked under the bed for him."
"I have always been a firm believer that the '03 Dallas team was the best Mavs team we've seen. '06 Was great but it was not nearly as balanced, Dirk did a ton of heavy lifting. 07 is the same story but with better defense. '11 is incredible and way more balanced offensively/defensively than the '03 team, but I still think the '03 team could've won due to the sheer amount of offensive firepower they had.   Dirk was in his athletic peak, and putting up 25/10/3 on near 50/40/90. Finley was a 22 ppg threat with great defense and 3PT shooting, like a better defending slightly worse scoring Khris Middleton. Nash was all NBA 3rd team that year and averaging 18 &amp; 8 on \~50/45/90. Then you had Raef LaFrentz at center, he shot 40+% from 3 and averaged nearly 2 BPG, Nick Van Exel off the bench, who could go for 30+ points any night.  Everyone in that lineup shot 40% from 3 except Van Exel, and he was no slouch from 3. Everyone but LaFrentz could give you 30 points on any given night, and Dirk was routinely scoring 40+ points.  If that team was transported to 2015 with Don Nelson as their coach, they'd be even better. So much offensive firepower, everyone fit together really well, and Dirk was just unreal that year. Shame he got injured in the WCF. Series was tied 1-1 and he goes out in game 3 and Dallas loses in 6. I think a healthy Dirk pushes that to 7 games, and possibly wins it all. I think Dallas would also have easily won the finals against New Jersey.  Imagine Dirk and Nash's legacy if they had a championship by age 24 and 28 respectively."
"Jason Kidd was like 37 and Khris Middleton is still in his prime. He‚Äôs putting up better numbers this year then he was in 2019 when he did make the ASG.  Same with Jrue Holiday, he‚Äôs much better this season then he was the year he made the ASG. But to be fair it was a pretty weak All-Star selection and it was way back in 2013.  Point is, making the ASG don‚Äôt really matter when May/June come around."
Khris Middleton ~~is~~ was an all star.

The Khris Middleton slanders on twitter had me rolling. ü§£ü§£
"Harden rejected an almost max contract from OKC and signed an actual max contract with the Rockets. In his first year in Houston he averaged 26 points and was a top 5 scorer in the league (fun fact, those 3 were all top 6 scorers in the league that year). Yeah, he wasn't an MVP, neither was Russ, they were all MVP caliber players though. The fact OKC had too much firepower in their starting lineup and decided to use him off the bench doesn't change that.  In any case, don't compare that level of talent to Khris Middleton and Bledsoe, thanks."
Isn‚Äôt Khris Middleton a 50/40/90 All NBA player?
"A lot of it is that somehow Khris Middleton and every Bucks role player forgets how to play basketball in the playoffs. People blame Giannis but really, there‚Äôs not much he can do. His teammates just suck in the playoffs, even with rosters from completely different years . It‚Äôs like a curse or something."
"No thanks. Middleton is at least passable defensively and usually doesn‚Äôt chuck as much as he has the past 2 games. He‚Äôs nearly been 50/40/90 the past 2 seasons. You‚Äôre also completely underselling Khris as a 3 point shooter compared to CJ, Khris has shot a higher percentage in fact. Unless we‚Äôre getting another piece like Covington I don‚Äôt see how it benefits us at all and I don‚Äôt see Portland being interested in giving up more than CJ."
"I mean both have had some pretty disappointing playoff performances and haven't been able to turn their regular season success into a championship.   Even at that, when people talk about Giannis getting shut down in the playoffs, he's still putting up crazy numbers. People talk about last year as his worst showing but he averaged something like 27/14/6/1/1 on over 50% from the floor and over 30% from three, which is good by his standards. There are plenty of hall of famers and all time greats who have never come close to posting playoff numbers like that.   Add onto that that Giannis has never had a bonafide superstar alongside him like harden has pretty much every year of his career. Khris Middleton is a great player, but compared to guys like KD x2, Russ x2, CP3, Howard, and Kyrie there's a very, very large gap."
I mean they had the no.1 record &amp; Giannis was putting up great stats his first MVP &amp; then he &amp; his team were outdoing their selves for most of the season on his 2nd MVP.   Also most media members didn‚Äôt consider Khris Middleton a bonafide no. 2 so that also landed in Giannis‚Äôs favor. I think he deserved it
"In theory, that make sense. But the Nets even without Harden still have 2 of the top isolation players in the league with KD &amp; Kyrie.   And slowing the game down means the Bucks needs to first get a sizeable enough lead in the first place, if they get pounded in the 1st quarter like they did earlier today s then slowing the game down isn't what you want when attempting to chase a game.  The Bucks will also be limiting themselves, Giannis is a walking mismatch in transition because he's too quick for bigs to keep up while being too big for wings to contain. Unless Khris Middleton wants to hit 60% of his shots like he did vs the Celtics in 2018, slowing the game down might still hurt the Bucks more than the Nets."
"I mean I think he just played really badly against the bucks. He shot like 35% on jumpers, and everyone knows that's mostly him. He also beat the Pacers in 4 games and was by far the best player. Every great player can have a bad series. Giannis is having one right now lol., and he had a bad one last year too.   But really these narratives are always kinda silly. Kyrie plays championship basketball and great players want to play with him. He's shown he can get a team to the playoffs and get past the first round without a great second option, same thing that people like Harden, Steph and CP3 have proven.   And as you can see, being an elite second option isn't something to scoff at. Khris Middleton fails at that every single year. Bam failed this year. You need two superstars two win a championship most of the time, and you add a top 5-10 player with Kyrie (a top 15 player) you have a great chance to get one."
"Tatum took a game off the Nets WITH JAMES HARDEN basically by himself, why can't Giannis at least make it competitive? Khris Middleton is a hell of a lot better than the Celtics second best healthy player was too."
Damn those are Khris Middleton numbers
"Trade coach then ship Middleton, Brook, and Donte. They need a new system to build around Giannis. They've reached the peak of this system at this point.  Now the question is who are available? Obviously Beal will be thrown in the conversation.  I think they can try to take a shot on Hield and Bagley of the Kings. Khris + Donte for Hield and Bagley straight up or something"
"I kept trying to tell people fans were just trying to hype themselves up into thinking anyone has a chance against the Nets. People would say ""oh they don't have a rim protector"", MF you really out here thinking you need defense when you have KD, Harden, and Kyrie?   People were really out here convincing themselves Giannis, Khris Middleton, and Jrue Holiday were gonna compete against Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving. Got me fucked up.  I will say one thing I was wrong about, I said the Bucks have a chance if one of the big 3 gets injured but right now it's looking like that's not even true."
And that battering ram had Kobe. And Khris Middleton ain't Kobe
"On paper sure, but you could have replaced Khris Middleton with an actual middle schooler and achieved the same result in the first quarter of this game."
That is propped up by the absolutely insane series he had vs the Celtics in 2018 where he had a near 60/61/74 splits.  He was good vs the Pistons (46/46/90) &amp; Heat 2021 (49/40/90)  But damn near every series he's played apart from those 3 he's shooting waaayy below his averages. Raptors 2019 &amp; Heat 2020 are the only ones where he's cracked 40% from the field.  Idk about you but that isn't very 5yrs/$177m cash money of Khris Middleton
"Yeah I guess you have a point actually. 55/40/90 is a lot more exclusive than I would have thought. Literally the only members of that club is Kyrie Irving x1 and Stephen Curry x3.  On the flip side, setting it to just 50/40/90, but instead using 2P%, gives us the following:  Larry Bird x2  Mark Price x2  Reggie Miller x1  Chris Mullin x1  Peja Stojakovic x1  Steve Nash x4  Jose Calderon x1  Ray Allen x1 (I forgot to check minimums before saying he'd get like 4, my bad)  Kevin Durant x1  J.J. Redick x1  Stephen Curry x4  CJ McCollum x1  Kyrie Irving x2  Malcolm Brogdon x1  Khris Middleton x1  In retrospect and after remembering what the minimum makes are, I actually agree with you. I think this list covers it pretty well, with it being largely the same except for a couple newcomers, as well as Steph, Price, and Kyrie getting more of these seasons."
And it‚Äôs only Giannis and Khris Middleton
My current best casual fan doesn‚Äôt give a fuck/know a fuck roster:  PG: Jamal Murray   SG: Norman Powell  SF: khris Middleton  PF: John Collins  C: Deandre ayton
Fuck Khris Middleton I‚Äôve been saying it for years.  You can‚Äôt win a chip with this dude as your SG.
Do you think it's a coincidence that Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton are finding it hard to score?  Giannis fucks up the spacing and is a mediocre playmaker
Khris Middleton starting at the 3?

"The Bucks second or third best players are #3s on any true championship caliber team. This was so predictable. I didn‚Äôt expect these games to be blowouts but the people that think the 76ers and Bucks are comparable to the Nets. They‚Äôre not.   It‚Äôs a star league. The Nets have the best two in the conference. Why do people think that Joel and Ben Simmons of all people have a shot? Why do people think the bucks are going anywhere with Kris Middleton as their second best player? Or Jrue Holiday? If any of those players outside of Embiid ever scored 30 in a playoff game, those cities would throw a parade.   NBA fans do this crap every single year and it‚Äôs so comical. It‚Äôs a star driven league. Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday‚Ä¶those aren‚Äôt stars. Ben Simmons is not a star. This was the expected result.   Nobody should have predicted blowouts in the first two games but Khris Middleton? Jrue Holiday? They score 30 in any game and it‚Äôs like a miracle."
It‚Äôs a joke bc he‚Äôs not playing like Khris Middleton at all in the playoffs lol

Khris Middleton just needs to imagine every Nets play in a Celtics jersey.
Mike James &gt; Khris Middleton in the playoffs
"Khris Middleton, part-time Celtics boogeyman &amp; full-time playoffs bricklayer  Seriously the man [shoots like shit in the playoffs](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/middlkh01.html#all_playoffs-series), there have been only 3 series in his career (Boston 2018, Detroit 2019 &amp; Miami 2021) that he hasn't spent it laying bricks"
"nah, it's REGULAR SEASON GIANNIS, Jrue ""On Holiday"" and Khris ""no effort"" middleton"
"They got a lineup of Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez, Brynn Forbes, Jeff Teague and Patt Connaughton üíÄüíÄ"
"As far as football comparisons go, Giannis is looking like Peyton Manning right now. Khris Middleton looking like Marvin Harrison."
"It's a percentage of the cap.  They'll be fine. Superstars are a crazy deal, which is why they cap max salaries - market rate for guys like Lebron/Jokic/Luka/Durant would be more like 50-60% of the salary cap.  It's actually kind of a thing that fucks smaller market teams.  Everyone is going to spend their cap, but smaller market teams that can't attract free agents just have shittier max players. Klay and Kemba make almost as much as Lebron and Durant.   Here's a list of some players that make as much or more than Bradley Beal:  Steven Adams  Kevin Love  Blake Griffin  CJ McCollum  Kristaps Porzingis  Khris Middleton   It sucks when you're a smaller market team and you are paying the same amount for below-all-star level talent as your opponents do for generational talents."
"Khris ""literally cj Mccolum"" middleton"
At this point I'm willing to sub in Logan Paul for Khris Middleton
"# Congratulations, Khris Middleton, for winning the Davis Bertans Award for Outstanding Shooting!"
Khris Middleton is an elite 3-4 option at best
Everyone always trying to tell Milwaukee fans how good Khris Middleton is because they look at stats and don‚Äôt watch our games.
Every time I watch Khris Middleton he bricks every shot and makes me wonder how he was an all-star.
Khris Middleton is a bald fraud
"Nets Big 3 this series: KD, Kyrie, Khris Middleton"
"I think it is a lot more players than people think.  Look at some of the players on here [for example](https://www.espn.com/basketball/story/_/id/30482938/ranking-best-nba-players-2020-21-50-11). I think there are over 20 players that can be the best player on the team and still win it all if the rest of the team is really good as well. If you have a team like Jrue Holiday, Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert for example I think that team can win it all."
When are we going to have a conversation about how inadequate Khris Middleton is as the secondary ‚Äústar‚Äù for a championship ‚Äúcontender‚Äù?
Khris Middleton is shockingly bad at basketball
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E3UflCJX0AMT1YI?format=jpg&amp;name=240x240  Khris middleton this series
I'm a Celtics fan and my perception of Khris Middleton was WAAAAAYYYY off. He is not Kobe Bryant when he's not playing us and looks like a poor man's Tim Hardaway Jr.
Imagine if the Bucks went all in on James Harden or Chris Paul instead of holding on to Khris Middleton lmao.
Someone on here said Khris Middleton looked like a PT cruiser and now I can‚Äôt look at him the same
Khris Middleton ü§ù Floyd Mayweather  Just getting some cardio in

Oh shit. Khris Middleton finally got put into the lineup. We have a ballgame now.
Khris Middleton 0/8  Geezus
its so infuriating watching khris middleton become abdel nader when hes been michael jordan vs us for the past 5 years
It's ok Khris Middleton is playing for them tonight instead.
How is Khris Middleton 0-8?
The fraud Khris Middleton is back at it again in the post season
Khris Middleton has forgotten how to shoot because of thoracic outlet syndrome
Khris Middleton has the Basketball Equivalent of the Yips
Holy shit lmfaooooo Khris Middleton is like 0/9 with 0 points going into halftime. And the streets were saying this was Middleton's team after Game 1 last round vs. the Heat

All the Jute Holiday and Khris Middleton apologists awfully quiet on the Bucks sub rn
"Death, Taxes and Khris Middleton forgetting how to play basketball come playoff time."
Khris Middleton are you fucking serious? I can go 0/7 and 0/3 in the nba and I‚Äôll do it for 60k a year lmfao
Khris Middleton is the worst ‚Äústar‚Äù player since‚Ä¶?
"Yeah because you totally drafted Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holliday. The only good player on your team who is home grown is Giannis."
Nah I think big 4 in KD Harden KI and Khris Middleton is enough to win a chip.
Guys but Khris Middleton almost joined the 50/40/90 club in the regular season guys
"Khris Middleton has removed ""forward for the Milwaukee Bucks"" from his instagram bio"
I‚Äôve been watching Khris Middleton shrink in the playoffs for 7 years.. he‚Äôs not who people think he is. Jrue is decent but nothing special. Brook Lopez is also decent nothing special. KD and Kyrie outweigh all of that star power is real. Talent matters
What really *is* a Khris Middleton?
Khris Middleton needs to just get braces this off season. Crooked teeth makes a crooked shot.
I'd rather have Eric Bledsoe than Khris Middleton right now.
"Tbf what did he expect, no team with Khris Middleton as the #2 is ever sniffing a championship"
"Playoff experience matters so much, you got two champion players there making all the right shots. And also having the right energy.   Khris Middleton, with all his talent, seems to be suffering from a lack of confidence. But I'm not the one to complain."
"Khris Middleton: -17, 0-6 from the field so far. Yikes"
"Khris Middleton is now the standard for dogshit contracts, replacing Siakam."
Khris Middleton is truly. Truly terrible at basketball
Khris Middleton is having a Eugene from Hey Arnold kind of day
Putting faith in Khris Middleton again and again and expecting a different result is the definition of insanity
khris middleton is a 6'7 eric bledsoe
Everytime I pick the Bucks Khris Middleton turns into the worst shooter in the world
Khris Middleton can apparently only play basketball against the Heat and Celtics.
Khris Middleton making KP look like a solid 2nd option

khris middleton boutta join tingus pingus and kuzma on the guangdong tigers next year if he keeps playing like this
Who the fuck gave Khris Middleton a max?
"Fun fact: Khris Middleton has a sister who is of British Royalty named Kate.  She is currently the Duchess of Cambridge, don‚Äôt believe me? Look up Kate Middleton"
"He's right. In between Jrue Holiday, Giannis, and Khris Middleton, I can confidently admit.....  HEAT IN 6 MFS üî•üî•üî•üòÇ"
The next Khris Middleton?
How dare you imply that Khris Middleton is not top-20 all-time.
"**Most games as top scorer - best on team**  1. Stephen Curry - 52 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo - 50 3. Luka Doncic - 49  **Most games as top scorer - second best on team**  1.

"Sixers acquired Tobias Harris through trade, then resigned him in free agency so that label is a bit misleading.  That would be like saying the Bucks acquired Khris Middleton in free agency in 2019"
I still can‚Äôt believe Khris Middleton didn‚Äôt make it in here
"Khris Middleton has some silky smooth games. Tyler Herro (still early in his career) but he has some plays where it seems like he knows where everyone is and what they‚Äôre gonna do on defense and premeditated moves to get pass them, very silky"
Khris Middleton &amp; Jrue Holiday.
"Khris Middleton last year, Tobias Harris, Chris Paul, Jokic, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Zach Lavine, Mikal Bridges, John Collins were all pretty close-very close"
"I don't think Grant is a legit #1 option. His scoring definitely suffered as the season moved on. He'll be like a poor man's Khris Middleton, which is perfectly swell.  But overall the most enjoyable season of the past decade, besides the Tobias Harris playoff season. We fought hard and got to see young players develop."
It's not hate if it's nothing but the truth. Ask Khris Middleton last year. He would have made it with the same amount of games as Kyrie played.
You do when you're about to be over the cap? See: Khris Middleton.
&gt;Middleton gets traded  Selfishly I would like to see this for the chance to trade CJ (and probably picks) for Khris. If the Blazers resign Powell and Nurkic our starting 5 would be:  Dame  Norm  Khris   RoCo  Nurk  We would be so much better defensively without really giving anything up on offense.
What about the bucks vs bulls? Should I pay Khris middleton or will it depend on the nets game?

Khris Middleton is my dad
"Honestly, if Bam was just more aggressive, then he would definitely be better than Jrue. He has so many weapons in his arsenal offensively that Jrue doesn't and he's as good of a defender as Jrue. If he aimed to always play like he did when he scored 40 against the Nets, it wouldn't even be a debate. I still choose him over Khris Middleton though."
Khris Middleton is the real MVP
The Sixers don‚Äôt have someone like Khris Middleton. A guy who absolutely refuses to let his team lose
If MJ was playing against modern defenders he'd be a more attractive khris middleton
"Khris Middleton. I don‚Äôt know how at this point, but they‚Äôre still haters"
I'd just like to add that the fact Khris Middleton does this in Celtics games but that he couldn't be arsed to score a few buckets in the olympics means that Khris Middleton hates America.
"Did you miss games 1, 2, 4, and most of 5 and 7? Khris had some ugly ugly stretches in this series. Khris and Jrue were 4/22 at half time of game 7, Giannis was the only reason we were in the game at half time. Again I‚Äôm not gonna say he had a perfect series but you‚Äôre ignoring any sort of context that paints Giannis in a good light. He had some clutch finishes down the stretch and hit some FTs that no one expected he‚Äôd make too.       And sure give Book credit for game 1 but he was far down on the list of reasons they won tonight. Ayton and Payne stepped up. It‚Äôs almost as if it‚Äôs a team game and everyone contributes. Khris Middleton taking and making shots down the stretch says more about Khris Middleton‚Äôs growth as a player than it says anything about Giannis. He‚Äôs an all star and should‚Äôve been all nba last year, Game 7 was his second game winner of the playoffs. Why wouldn‚Äôt we want the ball in his hands?      You‚Äôre making it harder than it needs to be. Everyone contributed in the Brooklyn series, everyone had some down moments too but every single one of the big 3 stepped up when it mattered most in game 7 on the road. That‚Äôs the takeaway. Giannis‚Äô teammates picked him up when he faltered and he picked them up when they faltered, same with Ayton and Payne picking up Booker tonight. That‚Äôs how good teams operate."

I don‚Äôt think Cade likes that comp.   He says he tried to model his offensive scoring game after Khris Middleton.
"You do know that the majority of his freethrows ARE legitimate right?  Total FTA doesn't mean total EGREGIOUS FLOP FOUL BAITING. Like... you guys gotta chill lol. KD had 2 FTA in a game when Middleton had like 11, what do you think about Khris?  When he can actually drive to the basket, he is largely unstoppable. And when guys get beat they foul.  What was bad about vs the Bucks was he wasn't beating anybody, he was just baiting. That's why the complaints came then when he had less FTA."
I will not put up with any Khris Middleton slander
If you swap Ben Simmons with Jrue Holiday or Khris Middleton the Sixers fucking maul you. The Hawks will lead for less than 5 minutes in the series and Giannis is going to average 45 points
"Its never great for a team when a trade changes names: The Brandon Jennings trade is basically now the Khris Middleton trade, its just that because he was a throwaway you can't even really call it that because Milwaukee wasn't even trading for him"
How dare he. That's KHRIS Middleton for him
I don‚Äôt like the tone in which you said Khris Middleton
You can. But obviously footage of Harden is easier to find than footage of Khris fucking Middleton.
Now they have celtics legend khris middleton
"The problem is Simmons isn't very good or even good. He's a mediocre player. You can't or shouldn't really want to coast on being mediocre. It'd be one thing if he was say, Khris Middleton level of very good and say yep, that's where I'm gonna stop getting better but he isn't. I get that not everyone can be basketball obsessive like Kobe but Simmons is on the other end of the effort scale here."
As a huge khris middleton fan this really excites me.
"You‚Äôre right Derozan can‚Äôt win as a first option. That‚Äôs like saying Khris Middleton can win a championship as the first option (love me some Kha$h tho), but, with that said, Derozan would not be the first option there. He would be option number 3. Along with that, I don‚Äôt really see anyone offering a 35 year old Lowry 20+ million. Maybe 15-18 million but that‚Äôs just me."
"Agreed. Thought about Murray and Christian Wood myself  PG Tyrese Haliburton   SG Jrue Holiday   SF Khris Middleton   PF Ben Simmons   C  Myles Turner   The smart play is probably to put Murray at one of the guard spots but I like the kid and think he would flourish with these players. I envision Simmons running the offense and defense ala Draymond while having better coverage on D from Turner and the Junkyard Dog, Jrue Holiday."
&gt; his mid range regressed as well  Dejounte was literally one of the best midrange shooters in the NBA this season. Comparable to Khris Middleton. And his midrange percentages for the 2021 season are barely different than 2020.
"I'd say this is the Suns title to lose. They are good enough to take down the Kawhi-less Clippers without CP3.   Granted, I do expect a Chuck-Guarantee at some point and in turn Khris Middleton will be the Finals MVP."
Giannis is not a closer. That‚Äôs Khris Middleton.
"They also aren't really calculating the toll asking  Joe Harris to guard Khris Middleton is going to take.  Harris isn't exactly a great defender normally, but you're asking him to expend all sorts of energy on one end of the floor and then be good on the other one.  Wasn't going to end well.  You don't need to move on from him, but you need to bring in some better wing defenders so you have options."
"Were Kyrie &amp; Harden guarding Giannis? Are their absence the reason Giannis scored 30 PPG in the series?  You can argue the Bucks would have lost without those injuries (and I agree), but that wouldn't have been on Giannis.  That would have been on Jrue and the other supporting cast not named Khris Middleton."
This whole series will be determined by Khris Middleton
"I've been high on the Hawks all year, even when they were struggling. I still like their model of team building. They have 8-9 guys who can all get 15ish ppg. They always have multiple scoring punches on the floor  We'll see. If they run into ""Seeing Green"" Khris Middleton, then they done for"
Man took PJ Tucker over Khris Middletonüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
I still remember sitting a ski resort and the whole place watching that game where Terry Rozier and Khris Middleton went back and forth and Middleton hit some insane deep 3 to tie or win.
"The big knock on Trae Young is that he's an abysmal defender and in the playoffs teams will be able to gameplan and hunt him.   In the first two rounds of the playoffs, he's gotten lucky, going against the Knicks, who don't really have a great point guard to go at Trae with, and the 76ers have...Ben Simmons. That being said, Derrick Rose and Seth Curry each both had really great series against the Hawks.   The Bucks are going to go at Trae hard with Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton, and I think the Hawks, especially without DeAndre Hunter, are going to have a really hard time defending the Bucks in this series.   tldr -- Trae's biggest weakness, his defense, hasn't really gotten exposed yet this playoffs, but probably will against the Bucks."
"&gt;When you‚Äôre shooting cold you can go the way of Joe Harris or the way of Khris Middleton and have faith  What.... Joe still shot the ball til the end, it's not like he's passing the ball when he has a dunk under the basket"
And khris middleton wasn't
Justice for my man Khris Middleton
He literally plays with Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday but go off
So just fuck Khris Middleton then?
"Unfortunately, we have Khris Middleton to take his place. The thing with Curry though is every time the shot goes up I just automatically think it‚Äôs going in. He‚Äôs like his brother in that regard, just a clean stroke"
"I fw Khris Middleton so much,  reminds me of Joe Johnson."
Trae Young     Khris Middleton    Jrue Holiday     ü§ù Nobody will remember how poorly I shot in Game 7 ü§ù
Khris Middleton
"Khris Middleton was drafted by the Pistons but was included in a trade for Brandon Jennings to match salaries (RIP Pistons) at the end of his rookie year. The year we got him was the year the Bucks drafted Giannis, so him and Khris have been on the Bucks together for 8 years now."
"At the time Middleton was averaging 20/6/6. Brown was averaging 26/6/4.   Both were around the same scoring efficiency (60% vs 61%). Both team records were similar (within 2 games).   &gt; Khris was more, especially in hindsight   By ""hindsight"" do you mean including things that happened after the allstars were voted on? Because thats ridiculous and just trying to be a victim."
"Just so we‚Äôre clear, I‚Äôm not saying Brown *wasn‚Äôt* deserving, just that Khris was more, especially in hindsight.  Middleton was 22/7/6 with 50/40/90 efficiency. A handful of players in NBA history have been that efficient at that volume. Sure, the Bucks at the time didn‚Äôt have a much better record than the Celtics, but it was better."
"I pay attention to international basketball and international competitions. That's why I know that this USA roster is already much better than that year's American roster. Americans that led in minutes in that game: Kemba, Harrison Barnes, Donovan Mitchell, Myles Turner, Khris Middleton."
"I'm just salty about losing lol   Was always a Giannis fan but watching him for this whole series I realized I absolutely hate his playstyle. Maybe it was just the contrast with KD. At the same time the series gave me so much more respect for Khris Middleton though, what a beast."
"Khris Middleton is probably the worst player who consistently looks like he‚Äôs Kobe in the clutch, those mid range fade-aways have won the Bucks so many games, he‚Äôs one of my favorite players"
"Go home you‚Äôre drunk.   First of all the premise is wrong. Khris Middleton has put up some big games but has been inconsistent this playoffs so far. Overall he‚Äôs put up 23-8-4 but at only 55.6 TS, so he‚Äôs played well but certainly not great so far.   Second, even if he had played better it‚Äôs still no where close to being enough for the HOF. He doesn‚Äôt have enough individual accolades where just one ring would be enough."
Khris Middleton in the last 4 games of the series  28 points/9 rebounds/5 assists/3 steals and shot 41% from 3 on 8 attempts
"Khris Middleton is a two time all star, and neither appearance was this year.  Holiday made one All Star game in 2012.   Blake Griffin started for the Nets last night and he has double their total appearances combined."
"Middleton doesn‚Äôt nearly belong with those other two names lmao. You‚Äôre comparing a two time all star to 3 and 4 time All NBA players.   Middleton wasn‚Äôt even an all star this season. Giannis was the only Buck nominated.  But sure, let‚Äôs act like Khris Middleton is comparable to Kyrie and Anthony Davis lmao"
I do Boggys a better shooter and passer and it really seems like the Bucks don't trust Jrue. He scored some clutch points late but it wasn't off sets. Khris ran sets with Giannis as the screener and it worked well enough but I feel like if they had another guy  they trusted late to run some offense they'd be less predictable.  Everybody knows Giannis runs O for 3.5 quarters then they switch to Middleton.
"way she goes, but jrue holiday and khris middleton shat the bed almost all game and giannis still kept it close enough to pull out the win against one of the best players of all time (who just scored THE MOST POINTS IN A GAME 7 in nba history)"
"He never gives up. When you‚Äôre shooting cold you can go the way of Joe Harris or the way of Khris Middleton and have faith. Idk if Khris missed 10 shots in a row, he should keep shooting. Also Khris in elimination games is usually incredible. Khris slander should be banned"
I think he'd be like Khris Middleton
Khris Middleton has always been incredible in elimination games win or lose. Oftentimes our best player in those games.
"Ever heard of khris middleton? Yeah, he's pretty good"
"He'd be a run in the mill all star probably   I agree with the other comment saying he'd be a slightly better Khris Middleton...although considering how soft KD is, he'd probably not even make the NBA if he was 6'6"" due to lack of confidence"
He‚Äôd be a slightly better Khris Middleton.
"He'd be similar to Khris Middleton aka mini Durant, but slightly better IMO"
"After carrying his team that couldn‚Äôt score without him. Solid argument, not everybody can have Khris Middleton be their closer in the final moments and take pressure off them.   But I don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm arguing, Giannis himself said KD was the best in the world."
"Zach Lowe provided some context about this in [his latest article](https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/31662289/nba-playoffs-2021-kevin-durant-giannis-antetokounmpo-sway-pressurized-game-7):  &gt;Still: Keep an eye on the offensive glass. Tucker is a voracious offensive rebounder, and **the Nets are hiding Harden on him**. Tucker in Game 6 bulldozed past Harden for a couple of offensive bounds. **If the Bucks can't punish Harden one-on-one with the ball, this is another way to do it.**   &gt;   &gt;...   &gt;   &gt;**Five of the six Bucks getting real minutes** \-- everyone but Khris Middleton -- **are average-ish** (or worse, in the case of Giannis Antetokounmpo) **3-point shooters**. That has made it **tough for the Bucks' stars to attack one-on-one**. The Nets shift their defense, **planting bodies between ball and rim.** That problem can be exacerbated when your best shooter (Middleton) is also your key ball-handler.   **It has complicated Milwaukee's (way too limited) attempts to hunt the wounded Harden one-on-one, which would seem the easiest method of scrounging points.** This is what the Bucks' stars see when they face up"
"Jayson Tatum and Khris Middleton scoring more on a better TS% than James Harden isn't something that I would have expected  Granted, the sample size for Harden is two more games than Tatum and 3 more than Middleton"
Khris Middleton babbbbbyyyu

Reminder: Joe Harris started over Khris Middleton for Team USA in 2019.   Second Reminder: That team came in 7th Place at the FIBA World Cup lmao
"Also without Khris they never had a chance, your argument is fine, but it applies to both players. I'm not even a Middleton fan, but he balled out in this series. He made some bad decisions, but so did Giannis."
"""2 points isn't 2 points. It's a lie. 2 points is not 2 points. I'll explain it to you later. Coaches have said that for years, but 2 points is not 2 points"" - Jrue ""Khris ""LeBron James"" Middleton"" Holiday."
"Lmao. U really dont like giving Giannis credit. Even if Harden wasn‚Äôt as good as he normally is (even though he almost had a triple double but whatever), Kevin Durant was the second coming of Jesus Christ this series, and Giannis beat him.  Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday actively shit the bed as well as Bud running terrible plays like he was trying to go home. The Nets had like 4 of the best 5 performances this game and Giannis came out on top. Oh, Blake Griffin also played great defense and had some clutch buckets and PJ Tucker fouled out in OT. Giannis still wins.   Idc what happened with Harden, Giannis is a clutch player and nothing casuals say will change the fact that he showed tf up today. Yall will come up with every excuse before admitting that he proved the haters wrong today"
"Khris Middleton has beat the Celtics into submission so many fucking times I can only respect the man at this point. He's a fucking beast and played a hell of a game tonight, hope he gets a ring."
To be fair khris Middleton saved the bucks tonight
Tell the teams that didn‚Äôt have duos that it was fair to have multiple stars.   I‚Äôm sure Giannis is happy looking at Bron have AD while he has Khris Middleton
"Not just big shots, huge plays in general down the stretch. Khris Middleton was also 2/14 at one point. If you step up late though, that‚Äôs what matters. Can‚Äôt knock either"
"I wish, it was funny when he kept calling Jrue Holiday as Khris Middleton üòÇ"
i love khris middleton so much
Being forced to watch 4-7 more games of Khris Middleton chucking 30 shots a game and Giannis in his bag of run and dunk them take 4 minutes to shoot 2 free throws is torture
"I think the OT goes to show that while Giannis is our best player by far, Khris Middleton is the Buck's closer"
"I can't believe the Bucks were able to overcome Jrue ""Eric Bledsoe"" Holliday and Middleton combining for 14-49 (no, that's not a typo, they missed 35 shots).  On top of that, 2 of the worst inbounds plays I've ever seen to end regulation. Brook goes full JR Smith mode (even looks around wondering what happened LMAO), Giannis hits the side of the arena on the final play, my goodness.  But they were able to come up with plays when it mattered. Brook had some clutch rebounds/blocks, Jrue/Khris hit a couple big shots late in the game/OT.  Happy for the Bucks. They've been my team for the past ~3 years, but I jumped ship this year for the Suns. Hopefully cp3 can come back and they can meet in the finals; I'd love to see Suns vs Bucks for the chip."
now do khris middleton and jrue holiday
Please stop. Harden with zero explosiveness is not better than Jrue Holiday or Khris Middleton
I LOVE KHRIS MIDDLETON
NEVER DISRESPECT KHRIS MIDDLETON EVER AGAIN
Jrue Holiday had a godawful start (3/19) but made several key buckets late in regulation that were the reason Milwaukee was even in overtime. Credit to him too. Along with Khris Middleton.  Plus that might have been the best defensive play of the playoffs. To force Kevin Durant into that shot is incredible defense.
No I'm a Clippers fan. Kd harden and irving is a 1000x better to watch than khris Middleton and a bunch of rec ballers
GIANNIS  VS   THE NETS  KD  JRUE HOLIDAY  KHRIS MIDDLETON  THE REFS
NEVER DISRESPECT KHRIS MIDDLETON
all that just to lose to khris middleton smh
Khris Middleton saving Bud job
Khris Middleton.
Khris Middleton should've passed to Giannis on the dive.  Lopez should have put the shot up with 1 second left on the shot clock.    Wtf were they thinking man? This game was over.
how does khris middleton have 2 lazy eyes
It's Khris Middleton time.
"Khris Middleton game winner sadly, Nets fans will have to accept this"
Game 7 in the playoffs really decided by Khris Middleton vs Bruce Brown and Jrue Holiday vs Blake Griffin
"Who would‚Äôve thought that out of a series with KD, Harden, Kyrie, and giannis that khris Middleton would be the hero"
Khris Middleton shoots it pretty smoothly from the line for a guy that loses 20 pounds in sweat
Khris middleton earning. that. money.
LETS FUCKING GO KHRIS MIDDLETON
Khris Middleton needs some fucking respect on his name  Whoever wins this series is going to prolapse the Sixers/Hawks winner
Refs have not been good but neither has the efficiency of Jrue Holiday or Khris Middleton lmao
"Maybe it didn't need to be said, maybe it did but Khris Middleton is legit win or loss"
"Giannis and Middleton are the only ones with a free throw today, and Khris only got his only free throw from a tech on Giannis...."
Khris Middleton absolutely gotta show up now
Khris ‚ÄúKimura‚Äù Middleton
If Khris Middleton would like to stop making circus shots against us I am open to the idea
Khris ‚ÄúBatman‚Äù Middleton everybody
How is Khris middleton THIS bad
Isn't Khris Middleton a 90% FT shooter? Surely he has got some tips for his teammate
The Reason Khris Middleton
"Imagine you're Khris Middleton. Just had a great game, feeling yourself again, then you get disappeared by CLAMP Reddish fresh off the injury report"
Khris Middleton sweats taking out the trash on a Wisconsin winter night
Khris Middleton is top 5 most inconsistent players I‚Äôve ever watched
Khris Middleton always with the quick hands. Dude will rack up steals
"If you all don't understand what Bucks fans mean when they say that Khris is inconsistent as hell, just watch him in this series against the Hawks.  Game 1: Bad  Game 2: Good  Game 3: Better than Jordan  Game 4 so far: Bad  Packers fans like to call MVS the human coin flip, but MVS is more like a the human weighed die roll (since he gets a 'hit' only like 10% of the times). Middleton is the human coin flip."
"It amazes me how Khris Middleton either plays like a dingleberry or elite player, no inbetween"
Khris ‚ÄúKhash Money‚Äù Middleton     Khris ‚Äú20 points in the 4th quarter of an ECF‚Äù Middleton
"nah, nobody is sweatier than khris middleton, nobody"
I think Khris Middleton would have a solid shot at winning at FMVP.
"Considering how bad Kristaps has been def not. I don't think he's any better of a fit around Giannis than Khris, prolly worse tbh. Don't think the Mavs have anything valuable enough to offer for Middleton. I could have seen Middleton getting traded if they lost early, but I don't think it would have been to the Mavs."
Top 10 Active Players Remaining:  1) Giannis  2) Paul George  3) Devin Booker  4) Trae Young  5) DeAndre Ayton  6) Khris Middleton  7) Jrue Holiday  8) Chris Paul  9) Reggie Jackson  10) John Collins
I have it on good authority (Kendrick Perkins) that Giannis is Robin and Khris Middleton is the best player on the Bucks.
Khris Middleton
"Khris Middleton is not some great playoff performer, he is so inconsistent"
"That's true, I just mentioned leadership because that's what the commenter I was replying to was talking about. They're both great players obviously but when you have Khris Middleton going that hot, you pass him the ball."
"Lol, if anyone is leading that team it is Kris Middleton my guy.  Giannis has numbers, but when it is crunch time and the pressure is high, you know who is hitting the big shots? Khris."
"Aside from the obvious need for outrageous takes on these shows, I don't actually know if Perkins even understands the point he thinks he's trying to make.    His analysis seems to be that the Bucks win when Middleton plays well and they lose when he doesn't. That is indeed typically the case, but because Giannis gives you 30 points parctically every single game, so the games outcome is ostensibly binary.    ""Did Khris play like shit?""    If yes they lose, if not then the Bucks win lol (unless Jrue really pops off I suppose, though that wasn't enough in game 1 vs the Hawks due to Khris really playing like shit with his 0-9 from 3pt outing in a 3 point loss)."
"Damn dude, I was just joking around. Thanks for Khris Middleton though, y‚Äôall real ones for that."
This. The only way you're wrong is if we somehow sweep you or win in 5 and Middleton goes nuclear in 3 games. But if it's not an easy series for the Bucks (and I don't think it will be) Middleton can't keep up with Giannis. I guess Giannis prefers an easy series and Khris winning FMVP than a 7 game series and him getting it if we win game 7 though.
"It‚Äôs very hard to be 2 way. That‚Äôs why kawhi, kd , pg or even Khris Middleton are so valuable"
The thing with giannis (and this is a hot take btw) is I truly think as the best player on whatever team he‚Äôs on would have better success if he took a more secondary role. Like giving khris Middleton the green light to handle the ball / get shots up and close out the game but use giannis as the lethal weapon that he is.   Anytime giannis takes a turnaround fade-away or a 3 pointer it‚Äôs genuinely a wasted possession and you‚Äôre making the other team happy. You should never do what the opposing team wants you to do.   At the very least Middleton should be the closer.
Khris Middleton? CJ McCollum?  PG is supposed to be the best out of these guys too.
Paul ‚ÄúKhris Middleton‚Äù George tonight absolutely popping off. Love to see him shut up the haters one more time. Imagine if instead of a nonexistent kawhi he had an actual other max player with him.
Great value Khris Middleton got some praise on The Last Dance and now he doesn't know how to act
Reggie Jackson really just turned into prime Khris Middleton wtf
I‚Äôm not sure if Khris Middleton or Paul George is streakier. Both have the highest highs and lowest lows.
Just look at that quote from him earlier today or last night. He said he told Khris that the day he retires will be the saddest day of his career. Trading Middleton would be a great way to piss Giannis off and push him out of town.
"&gt;In the winter of 2015, Kidd sensed an unspoken tension as Middleton, Antetokounmpo, Monroe, and Jabari Parker felt out a hierarchy. He wanted it in the open. He interrupted a film session and asked every player on the roster, one by one, who was best among them.   &gt;   &gt;""It was awkward,"" Middleton says. Most nominated Middleton. Antetokounmpo refused to go along. ""He was stubborn,"" Monroe says.   &gt;   &gt;""Khris was better then,"" Antetokounmpo admits.   &gt;   &gt;Middleton and Antetokounmpo ratcheted up the physicality defending each other in practice. ""We were fighting for that top spot, and we were almost actually fighting,"" Antetokounmpo says. ""I would come home with bruises and scratches.""  [https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/26041744/khris-middleton-rare-kind-second-star](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26041744/khris-middleton-rare-kind-second-star)"
LeBron sitting on the team bench has more of a positive impact than Khris Middleton on the court
"He didn't just stand in the corner. He had a usage rate of 29.8% in the 4th, went 1/4. They lost the game because Khris Middleton had 20 in the quarter."
Tbf Middleton is the Bucks closer he is as much of a first option as his shots are falling that night.  But no one should be debating Khris Middletons career vs Marc Gasol. One is practically over and the other is in the middle of it. They play wildly different positions and very different paths to the NBA.
&gt;Khris Middleton Takes Over In Fourth Quarter **vs. Bucks**   How did BR still not change the title? It has been over 12 hours since they posted this video.
"Yep I'm very proud of them, even now this series has felt winnable, until last night's 4th qtr. I still anticipate that they'll make it tough for Milwaukee, it's still 2-1, but I don't know if we can go the distance (although if any team can shock me in that department it's this one). After what Trae has shown this playoffs I truly think this exact team, if healthy, could have won the title this year, which is obviously a great position to be in going into the next couple of seasons.   That said I'd be happy to see the Bucks go to the finals if that's what happens, I love that team and love Giannis and Khris ""37 point quarter Klay Thompson"" Middleton."
"Also, people act like 30/10 consistent is worse than a guy who puts up highly varied statlines causing the team to lose if he plays poorly and win if he goes off. Khris Middleton is an X-factor, but X-factors aren't better than the consistent guy putting up a monster statline."
He's not. Giannis is a walking 30/10 in the playoffs. Khris Middleton is the x-factor for sure because you know what Giannis is going to give you ever night.
Atlanta Hawks: We‚Äôre not going to pay a lot for a muffler.   Khris Middleton: You are going to pay a lot for a muffler.
"""Khris Middleton looks like someone drew Jay-Z from memory""   my all time favourite deskhrisption"
Khris Middleton is pretty close to Kyrie as a player.
"Ya know what, I always liked Middleton‚Äôs game too, until I put him in my Draft Kings lineup and he shits the bed. Then I fucking despise Khris Middleton."
Feel like all this Khris Middleton talk is gonna lead to him goin 5-23 in game 4

&gt;KM=KD ü§î   ~~K~~M=~~K~~D  M=D  Magnum=Dong  Khris Middleton is Frank confirmed
"Yup. Giannis and Middleton used to go at it all the time. One time they bet each other $1000 on who would win in that day's scrimmage. It was a tied game, when Giannis' mother rocked up and scolded him for gambling money and being mean to his friends. It was then that Middleton realized Giannis told his Mom that Khris was his friend and so he came to terms with how he truly felt about Giannis and they became inseparable after that."
"Khris ""Todoroki"" Middleton."
Dread it.  Run from it.  Khris literaly-better-than-prime-MJ-against-the-Celtics Middleton arrives all the same.
"How many times does he mistake PJ Tucker and Khris Middleton per game?  Think we need to keep a counter.  PJ Tucker is shaped like a 6'5"" bowling ball.  Khris Middleton has one of the most, uh, *unique* faces in the league, and is 2-3 inches taller.  The level of senility/blindness it takes to repeatedly confuse them for each other....."
Still crazy that Khris Middleton was a throw-in in the Brandon Jennings sign-and-trade with Viacheslav Kravtsov
"Elite ball handling guards and wings from 2009 to 2019: Harden, Kyrie, Donovan Mitchell, Luka, Trae, Dame, beal, Steph, Khris Middleton, devin booker, Jamal Murray, Ja Morant. There are twelve all-star level guards in eleven years. If we just take the top half that is Harden, Steph, Beal, Luka, Trae, and Dame which is six in eleven years or about one every other year."
"Who is Khris Middleton? For the blind, it is the light. For the hungry, bread. For the thirsty, water For the dead, life. For the sick, the cure. For the prisoner, the freedom."
Let's make an All-Former Pistons team for this year's playoffs.   Khris Middleton Blake Griffin Reggie Jackson Tobias Harris Marcus Morris
Khris ‚ÄúI‚Äôm playing the Celtics‚Äù Middleton
"Yeah, that was when Luol Deng was Khris Middleton before Khris Middleton."
"It‚Äôs sucks but it was no ones fault. Also saying we went on a run directly after is a bit disingenuous to what actually happened and discounts the bucks play.   We played like ass from then up until the 7ish left in the 4th when Kha$h money Middleton went off. I believe the hawks even extended their lead from trae getting hurt to until he came back into the game. Bogi and Gallo were off in the 4th and JC to an extent too. Trae had to play off ball a lot more which definitely hurt and it looked like he was using less moves/crossovers that would require planting, but he did make some plays at the rim and hit a 3. Overall, Khris just went fucking god mode and won the game. The injury didn‚Äôt help but it didn‚Äôt lose them the game"
"""Stella got her groove back!"" - Reggie tonight about Khris Middleton"
Atlanta got to experience what Celtics Khris Middleton is like. Hope he sticks around a bit longer
did u just say bogi is better than middleton? i mean i‚Äôm a hawks fan but khris is miles ahead of bogi
"No one is at fault it was just an accident. As for the game itself, the Bucks came on towards the end of the second half and the Hawks shot 55% from the line so that didn't help. Injury or not they couldn't stop the Bucks (or more specifically Khris Middleton) in the 4th quarter."
Khris ‚ÄúKash‚Äù Middleton!!!!!
"Chuck pushes the ""Guarantee Button"" for a Bucks win and money falls. Tonight Bucks win with Khris Middleton becoming Khash Money Middleton. Chuck is a prophet."
Two idiotic responses pointing out the same thing.  Does it really need to be explicitly stated that Khris Middleton is overall a great player?  If he wasn't nobody would be talking so much about him playing awful lately it would just be business as usual.
I dont think so... Khris Middleton went nuclear..
Nobody is talking about the career of Khris Middleton you dumbass.  He was 2-16 from 3 the first 2 games of this series.  12-36 overall.
I mean khris Middleton went nuclear that helped as well
Khris Middleton is good.
Khris Middleton is basically a short inconsistent kd. If he goes off it's done. Giannis however keeps them in the game and is pretty consistent. But rarely can he close the game. I love the bucks line up
"Lmao, do you copy and paste this comment everytime a post involves Khris Middleton?"
Khris Middleton did his job in the 4th! Hit perimeter shots &amp; hit free throws to close this one out. He also outscored the Hawks dropping 20 in the 4th.
I just got released from a Turkish prison after 25 years. Is Khris Middleton the greatest player of all time?
It‚Äôs official. I‚Äôm taking Khris Middleton over Michael Jordan
"James Khristian ""Khris """"Khash Money"""""" Middleton"
"Khris had 18 entering the 4th and finished with 38. Hell, before 7:12 he had 21. From that point on he scored 17 of the Bucks' final 25. Hawks only got 7 more.  [Source: ctrl-f Middleton + mental math on the Q4 play-by-play](https://www.nba.com/game/mil-vs-atl-0042000303/play-by-play)"
"The year is 2028. Khris Middleton scores 55 points on 20/28 shooting against the Seattle Supersonics in Game 5 of the WCF after scoring the same amount in Game 3 of the previous series against the Vegas High Rollers. The Bucks' move to the Western Conference a few years prior has allowed Middleton to achieve what was once thought impossible: score 50 points in a playoff game against every single NBA team except for his own.  r/nba after the game: Bruh, Middleton thought them Sonics jerseys were CELTICS JERSEYS!!!  \*45k upvotes\*"
"I was gonna comment ‚ÄúKhris Middleton? More like Khris DIDdleton‚Äù, but then I thought well, maybe not"
"No, but Khris Middleton has an argument"
"Atlanta's jerseys are red, while Boston's are green.  Khris Middleton tends to go off against Boston, and tonight he had a great game."
Most people see Red when they lock in  Khris Middleton sees Green
I'd say the opposite. Where's the Gallo elbowing Middleton foul? I'll wait. Maybe this woke up Khris now that I think about it.
"Khris ""Ice Trae"" Middleton"
"**Broke:** Hawks lost because after they got out to a commanding lead, they started settling for lazy threes, stopped defending without fouling, and rarely tried to drive inside the paint.  **Woke:** Hawks lost because Khris Middleton got hot.  **Bespoke:** Hawks lost because the ref tried to hurt Trae Young.  **On Coke:** Hawks lost because Atlanta sports curse."
Khris ‚ÄúDowntown‚Äù Middleton
Khris Middleton is good at basketball
"Khris Middleton decided to wake up, no scary KD!"
Not just Trae  Hawks also lost DeAndre Hunter who would have been guarding Khris Middleton   Bogi Bogdonovic a key scorer is also playing very hobbled too

"Trae Young whining for calls, Marv Albert+Reggie Miller announcing, shitty reffing...it was a hard game to watch until God Mode Khris Middleton appeared"
Khris ‚ÄúMichael Jordan‚Äù Middleton
"Khris ""inconsistent as f*ck"" Middleton was balling in the 4th!"
Khris Middleton gave me depression
"Khris Middleton in the 4th quarter: ""I was seeing three Celtics players out there"""
"Khris ""Chuck Bucks"" Middleton"
"Yup, people can cry ‚Äúadjustments‚Äù all they want but I remember one particular Brooklyn loss was just Khris and Jrue playing like total dogshit all game and people were blaming Bud and his ‚Äúschemes and rotations‚Äù.  Guys, no fucking scheme can fix Middleton bricking open jumpers around the FT line with shots that look worse than Ben Simmons‚Äô free throws."
"The best scenario for the Bucks is that Jrue becomes better acclimated with the team in his second year and finds an offense to match with the great defense, Lopez becomes a 6th man rotating for Giannis at the 5 (Brook is getting older and the double bigs isn't working), and Middleton becomes his average each night, rather than the up and down player he is right now. Other than that, there's not much out there for them. No real draft picks or much opportunity to bring in new assets. They've got to hope they can even keep Portis, and he may end up a starter alongside Giannis, Khris, Jrue, and Pat/Dante."
Yeah I guess if Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday play aswell as KCP and Dennis they‚Äôll lose lol
Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday are such humble players that if they ever had a great game they must shit the bed at the next one just to offset everything
"I mean Harden had CP3, Giannis has, checks notes, Khris No Khash Money Middleton."
"mikal bridges - 4.5 million dollars this year, 27 points  &amp;#x200B;  Khris middleton - 30.6 million, 11 points"
"As it relates to the Khris Middleton tweet that came from my account a couple of hours ago‚Ä¶ I did not post that &amp; my passcode has now been changed,"
"Giannis had a better 3pt % than Khris Middleton today, and they both only scored one 3pter"
Jrue locked everyone up. Caught in the crossfire of that defense however was Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday.
Khris Poltergeist Middleton...  He has no excuse for being this absent on the court especially when Giannis is still injured but still goes out to put an all-time great performance
Mikal Bridges had 27 points on 15 shots  Khris ''Glorified jr smith'' Middleton and Cancun holiday had 28 points on 37 shots
Pat Connaughton is getting abused on defense.  Khris Middleton is doing his fan favorite houdini act  Jrue Holiday has become Eric Bledsoe.  Brook Lopez has reverted back into Brook Lopez after looking like prime Kareem in against the Hawks.  It's a damn shame.
Jru has been in his holiday since heat series. If u look up his numbers pathetic field goal % since heat series. Well Khris middleton according to Fucking Perkins is the  Batman whereas Giannis is Robin so that is that.
Friendly reminder that your entire fanbase thinks Khris Middleton is better than Tatum
"MIL needs the rest of their crew to be more consistent if they plan on winning this. Giannis will always be Giannis, but the rest of the Bucks, especially Khris Middleton, need to be better. i know this sounds very Capt Obvious, but the Bucks win 9 times out of 10 when Middleton plays well."
Khris Middleton is no longer Khash until he starts to continually deliver in the postseason
I was taking a nice nap on the couch during the Bucks vs. Suns game when gunshots rang out in my house. It turns out the sound was just Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton bricks clanging off the rim again. Keep it down you two!
Khris Middleton doesn't care about Greek people.
"Jrue ""Eric Bledsoe"" Holiday and Khris ""That's Not the Celtics"" Middleton rear their ugly heads."
"The Suns played well tonight knocking down the majority of their open looks (shooting 50% from three on 20/40) -- but they honestly still aren't the story as they were consistent while the combination of Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton dug a big enough hole that even Antetokounmpo's MVP-like performance couldn't drag them out of it.  Giannis was unstoppable tonight with 42 on 22 shots, 20 of those in the 3^rd where he scored 13 in a row himself, but all that spectacular work was undone with the lackluster contributions from Holiday and Middleton who shot 8-30 (2-8 from three) prior to the 4^th quarter and finished 12-37 and only 28 points.  All that being said, the Bucks shouldn't be demoralized as the Suns did what they were supposed to do and held home court advantage. The Bucks just have to expect more from Holiday and Middleton, who are both usually better at home, so this series is far from over."
"Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday are a disgrace.  Poor Giannis, risking everything while his teammates are shooting bricks"
Interesting way to spell Khris Middleton
Fuck Khris Middleton
"Also, Khris Middleton should have way more than zero free throw attempts. That's bs."
wow khris middleton and jrue holiday just fucking wow
Khris ‚Äú I think im KD‚Äù Middleton at it again.
Khris Middleton is ugly and his game is ugly.
Khris Middleton is so hot and cold it‚Äôs not even funny. Giannis is the only life force out there
Which tells you how inconsistent Khris Middleton is
And fuckimg Perkins was telling us Khris  middleton was batman and Yannis  was Robin. Eat that crow shit now fucking Perkins
Watching this game makes me mildly irritated that khris Middleton decided that the series against the hawks was when he would hit every contested three.
 Khris Middleton gets paid 177 million to be complete ass

Khris Middleton is fucking awful

I was taking a nice nap on the couch during the Bucks vs. Suns game when gunshots rang out in my house. It turns out the sound was just Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton bricks clanging off the rim again. Keep it down you two!
I just realized that Paul George is a consistent Khris Middleton offensively
I mean I'm not keen to watch the Suns win against another crippled opponent. It's not like the Warriors first year where they at least had to go up against LeBron. Hospital Giannis and Khris Middleton aren't compelling television
Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday just wasting a generational performance from Giannis smh
"I‚Äôd have 2021 Khris Middleton and Jrue over 2014 Wade and Allen all damn day, lmao"
I was told Khris Middleton was a max contract player.
someone needs to bench khris middleton. didnt box out book after he miss his shot then give up after he got the rebound. zero effort
I feel bad for giannis. This literally feels like early lebrons career when he just does not have that second guy. Bucks need to admit that Khris Middleton is just not that guy. I don‚Äôt watch a lot of the bucks but I do watch the playoffs and I don‚Äôt think he is consistent enough
Khris Middleton is invisible so far
"Shaq is the only example but it's not hard to see how life was easy for Shaq in post season and how difficult it is for Giannis. Maybe get him a Kobe or D wade, maybe it works for Giannis. But not Khris Middleton for sure."
"Khris Middleton 20:56 played, 2-10 from the field  Jrue Holiday 18:35 played, 3-14 from the field.   The Bucks where outscored 30-16 in the second half.   Yet you're losing your mind over a bog standard charge (that giannis didnt even get called for lmao)  Hold this L."
"Khris Middleton ain't ever leading a team to a chip as 2nd best player. That's pretty obvious.  Giannis can only drive to basket and play bully ball, 0 outside game, 0 midrange, 0 post game, awful at FTs, not a great passer. Name me a 1st option on a title winning team this limited."
&gt;Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton combine for 5-24 from the field currently  At least Jrue's defense has been good but damn. What is up with him
"What in the fuck happened to Khris Middleton? Dude is playing like Harden except without, you know, the points and assists"
Khris Middleton is honestly just JR Smith without the pizzazz.
Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday need to do some soul searching
Khris ‚ÄúBatman‚Äù Middleton and Jrue ‚Äúpoor man‚Äôs Eric Bledsoe‚Äù Holiday carrying the Suns‚Äô defense
"Jrue ""Khris Middleton"" Holiday"
Someone needs to lock Bud in a room with Giannis and Khris Middleton and force them to watch tape of the Kobe and Pau pick and roll until their eyes bleed.
I don't know why khris middleton calls for a screen when he goes the opposite direction everytime.
Khris Middleton tricked y‚Äôall.
"Once again, khris middleton is doing this shit where he misses the simplest mid rangers 12 times in a row"
I can‚Äôt stand watching Khris Middleton always start so fucking sluggish
$80 million between Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday
Khris Middleton back to playing like ass
khris middleton is so bad

Which Khris Middleton is gonna show up tonight
"I cant wait for the suns to be leading in the 4th getting cocky, and James Khristian (Khris(Kash Money)) Middleton makes 6 threes in a row again, followed by a PJ Tucker dagger.  Im still hurt from the last series and im not even a hawks fan."
"Here is why it is a foul for Booker but not for Middleton. Both times Devin Booker went up for a shot, he jumped forward into the defender. Khris Middleton had to jump sideways into Jae Crowder for there to be contact."
"yeah, but Tatum turned his ankle and didn't finish out the tourney, also frankly I like this team much better than the 2019 roster.  A good chunk of that roster is significantly below this squad (Plumlee, Harris, Smart, Barnes, Myles Turner for sure and also Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Kemba &amp; Derrick White)"
"Man please. They barely beat BK with only KD and if Trae doesn‚Äôt step on a ref‚Äôs foot they were going to get beat by the Hawks. They are a flawed team it‚Äôs not disrespect. We‚Äôve gone over this for years yet they have the same Achilles heel: giannis in half court and Khris Middleton being streaky.   Like even this series, on paper the bucks are supposed to be better!  Before this season most people would say Giannis &gt; Booker,CP3 at 36 ~ Middleton, Jrue &gt; Ayton .   Well, the lie detector says that‚Äôs a lie. Giannis is Giannis but the other 2 are perpetually iffy. Middleton streaky overall and Jrue just isn‚Äôt a shooter so he‚Äôs always gonna be up and down. Stop putting it on fans"
"Lol you're right man. The casual viewer likes watching CP3, Booker, Giannis and Khris Middleton more than LeBron, Curry, KD, etc.   Not like Game 1 of the 2018 Finals, which was the **4th straight Finals featuring The Warriors and The Cavaliers**, had almost 10 million more viewers than Game 1 of this year."
"West  S - Stephen Curry S - Luka Doncic S - LeBron James S - Kawhi Leonard S - Nikola Jokic B - Damian Lillard B - Devin Booker B - Paul George B - Zion Williamson B - Anthony Davis WC - Donovan Mitchell WC - Karl-Anthony Towns or Ja Morant or Chris Paul  Snubs - 2 omissions above and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Klay Thompson, and De‚ÄôAaron Fox  East  S - James Harden S - Kyrie Irving S - Kevin Durant S - Giannis Antetokounmpo S - Joel Embiid B - Trae Young B - Bradley Beal B - Jimmy Butler B - Jayson Tatum B - Bam Adebayo WC - choose 2 of Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Khris Middleton, Julius Randle, Domantas Sabonis, and Pascal Siakam"
It‚Äôs Khris Middleton   Or: James Khristian ‚ÄúKash Money‚Äù Middleton
Fellow Mavs fan and lack of superstar/superstar talent?  - Book - CP3 - DeAndre Ayton  - Giannis - Jrue Holiday - Khris Middleton - Lopez  There‚Äôs a lot of names here that a casual fan could pick out man. It‚Äôs simple: a team from California isn‚Äôt in the finals therefore not worth broadcasting or promotion
"Anyone else not care about ratings? I just want to watch some good basketball, which this series will no doubt have.  Plus to me the storylines are great. Two non-superteams battling it out, Giannis potentially getting his first ring after a disasterous last season playoffs. CP3 maybe finally getting his ring after dominating these playoffs. The emerge of the center god Ayton and wtf cam payne? Khris Middleton going nuclear in the absense of Giannis last series. There's some great basketball, but unfortunately casual fans just don't care because there isn't a lot of big names involved.  I'm enjoying this while I can because I know that most likely the next few years will be dominated once again by Curry, Lebron/AD, KD/Harden/Kyrie teams which I'm personally sick of seeing every finals."
"The way Middleton shot the ball all game looked like he thought he was Kobe.    Meanwhile there are narratives ‚Äúhe was getting fouled softly‚Äù.  Please, he was chucking tough shots like Giannis being contested.  I think this says more about Bud than Khris and Giannis."
"With the volume of his 3pt shots, 38% is great. Also, I think the general consensus with Klay is that he is a great sidekick who you can rely on to deliver more often than not. He is not Khris Middleton/Mo Williams type all star who only become an all star due to their team having a great regular season record. No one is saying that he can lead a team on his own as a superstar. Even Klay knows this.   Also, have you seen GSW the past 2 years without Klay? How can you say that  he is overrated when they can't even qualify for the playoffs without him."
"Khris Middleton, with the defender being Trae Young wearing a Celtics jersey"
The Bucks had the lowest foul rate in the league this year.   Khris Middleton became the first player in finals history to take 25 shots and 0 free throws.
"You replace Klay with Middleton on those GS teams, and Khris is seen as a future HOF too. His shooting probably never gets mythologised the way Klay's is, but it would be close"
"They had more wins because Giannis is a better player than tatum by far. Regular season the Celtics had Hayward who was borderline all star level good.  Toronto wasn‚Äôt even playing tatum that way. They were super focused on kemba after he gaped them the first 2 games.  Tatum isn‚Äôt getting those open looks without kemba attracting a full gameplan because they know he can pull up off a double screen with ease. Let me know when khris Middleton is getting game planned for.  Next year tatum is 100% getting exposed as fraudulent because he‚Äôs going to be playing without a super stacked team for the first time in his career.  And help of theis, Brown, Hayward, smart, kemba is a vastly better team than brook, Khris, hill, bledsoe, and Wesley Mathews.   The 2019 Celtics without tatum are probably still borderline contenders when healthy.  The 2019 bucks are losing for lamelo"
"Giannis is SLIGHTLY bigger(Giannis 6‚Äô11 242, Simmons 6‚Äô11 240), SLIGHTLY, faster, and slightly more athletic. He doesn‚Äôt have great post moves. He just muscles his way into the rim but then again how many players are actually skilled in the post nowadays? Giannis is a slightly better defender as both are first team all nba defense.   Steph is SIGNIFICANTLY better at shooting, playmaking, is much more explosive, is a much better handler, has a much higher basketball IQ, and is a much better finisher around the rim. That‚Äôs just an awful example. And somehow you picked a worse one by comparing KD, a 7 footer, and compared him with 6‚Äô7 Khris Middleton ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è You do not know hoops smfh."
Khris Middleton will regress to Khris Littleton
Khris Middleton most points in Finals history with out a free throw. Something something bad Bucks defense make a foul hurr durr dont touch the bad men
sure wasnt frustrating when Khris Middleton got more fts then kd and kyrie combined in game 3
"I distinctively remember Love beating up on Khris Middleton at times we went small. Outside of Bucks games and playoff games, idk that I watched a ton of Cavs... but from the glimpses I saw (and his overall stats compared to Brook), he definitely looked like more of a shot creator than Brook"
"Y‚Äôall are just being willfully ignorant at this point. Half of us stream so no.. no one has the play by play or the time to go back and find clips of questionable calls for you. It‚Äôs not just the free throw calls it‚Äôs the advantage playing from in front with the reffing on your side. Duhrrrrrrr Jrue and Middleton weren‚Äôt getting in the paint like Giannis !!! Uh DURRR what coach would say, ‚Äúyeah we‚Äôre getting no calls even when we‚Äôre getting the same or more contact as the suns guys at home so Jrue and Khris I want you to get in there and take that contact too‚Äù and when they do get irrefutable contact giannis goes to the line after he gets beat up on a double team and gets shouted down on as the league licks it‚Äôs lips at the sensationalized story lines. The AMOUNT of calls and how EARLY will directly correlate with a players style of play but we didn‚Äôt notice why Milwaukee had to switch to playing in the perimeter because while PHX doesn‚Äôt have the guys to defend the paint they have the refs on their side to negate their impact in the paint and make sure he gets minimal value from them. You don‚Äôt think having a foul-weary big switched on to your guards on the perimeter is gonna result in easy buckets? Yeah Bud could‚Äôve made adjustments but you‚Äôre fighting multiple battles here while still trying to establish a game plan for both sides of the floors while the home court team plays with a handicap. I would seriously like to know the record of games that have such an early free throw disparity between the teams."
"Exactly. If Khris Middleton, who averages 3 FTA a game, is taking by far the most shots on your team, dont expect a lot of free throws."
"I honestly just felt like Khris just isn't the best example of all of this from last night  I try my best to watch objectively (impossible) but as close as I can, and it felt like Khris had maybe 2 times he was fouled but spent most of the time doing that shit he does against the Celtics where he just pulls up in your face and drains it and you can't do anything  Jrue to me was getting murdered without calls and Giannis had a couple early that just like clearly were fouls, but the Middleton discrepancy is the one where I feel like, yeah I think maybe he should've shot 2-4 FT's, but it's not like he was fouled 10 times last night"
"This is pretty disingenuous, don't you think? ""Inside the paint"" you're including 3 outright jump shots and a 10 foot floater  https://www.nba.com/game/mil-vs-phx-0042000401/game-charts  His shot chart was linked in another thread today.  One of those 7 is an 11 foot fadeaway, and in the entire game he has 3 total drives in this shot chart  If you want to directly compare Book and Middleton, you're more upset that Booker actively seeks contact on his shots more than Middleton spent all game ""getting hacked""  The total number of drives was 3 to 2 in favor of Middleton.  Neither player lived at the rim, Book took 10 FT's because he is a step below Harden/Trae in trying to draw contact. He had an offensive foul last night for a kickout, you never see Khris doing anything like that"
You said a part of his game meaning it‚Äôs something he does every game. And you‚Äôre cherry picking Khris is averaging 4.4 FTAs that‚Äôs closer to 4 than it is to 5 but still Middleton clearly has never been that good at drawing fouls in his career based on his career numbers so I‚Äôm having a hard time believing it‚Äôs part of his game
\&gt;There should be no complaint about officiating when it comes to Khris Middleton not getting any free throws.  am i allowed to think both situations are ridiculous?
"&gt; This is actually pretty pointless if you don't go out there and find every single missed call for specific Suns players as well  Haha, if someone else wants to do that be my guest but this took too long as it is.  The point of the compilation is purely to counter the idea that the reason Khris Middleton set a new record for shots taken without a FT was because he didn't get fouled. He did, and even if you disagree that some of these are fouls, I do think it's hard to argue that they were less so than what was called in a lot of Suns players favour."
"Booker was more aggressive last night and sought out contact whereas Khris settled for 3s and contested jumpshots. Even though Khris had more ""shots in the paint"" those were primarily jumpshots or floaters. He only drove hard to the basket for layups 3 times all game. As a result, the refs missed at most 1 or 2 fouls against Middleton while Booker got the benefit of the doubt on 1-2 calls."
And here's a shot of CP3 and Ayton smiling at each other in slow motion! Khris Middleton looks not so happy in slow motion!
My response is that Booker also is a jump shooter. He took jump shots last night. He got foul calls. Clearly Middleton did not get foul calls for a reason other than he took a lot of jumpers. If jump shooting was the primary reason Khris had zero FTA I would have expected Devin Booker to have fewer free throw attempts considering he is also a jump shooter. It isnt that hard to get.
"Khris Middleton is a player who normally is a shoot first, drive second type of scorer. I don't think it's ridiculous to see that Giannis and Jrue were getting hacked with no calls and that then forced Khris to rely on his jump shot even more than usual."
"So you‚Äôre saying Khris Middleton drove the ball *two times*, didn‚Äôt get a call either time and decided to stop driving for the rest of the game? That sounds like a Middleton problem"
Khris Middleton also didn‚Äôt attempt a FT in game 2 of the Nets series and he took 20 shots. There were 10 games during the regular season where he didn‚Äôt take a FT were all those games rigged? Khris only averages 3.5 FT attempts a game its not uncommon for him to not go to the line.

And Khris Middleton had a game where he attempted more free throws than the entire nets team. Doesn't mean jack shit lmao. I said what I saw about refs not calling Tuckers defense
"Khris Middleton had 29 tonight, in this game Booker defended him well"
book or khris ‚Äúprime mj‚Äù Middleton
Khris Middleton &gt; Lebron  Lol
Khris Middleton would do the same

Being a Khris Middleton fan must be frustrating as shit. Coming from a Paul George fan lmao
Khris Middleton is Unfucking the NBA

"If you think Khris Middleton is great, wait 24 hours. If you think Khris Middleton is bad, wait 24 hours."
That‚Äôs Khris ‚Äúall I see are Celtics Players‚Äù Middleton to you sir
"It was the one before that actually lol. Middleton had a layup after a suns turnover and booker appeared to foul him. Khris made it anyways, but I thought it was probably a foul. Then the one you‚Äôre talking about happened. So he has three different fouls that would have fouled him out but didn‚Äôt get called"

"He was a throw-in, as others have said. If I recall correctly, there was one guy on RealGM who was adamant that he was actually better than Knight and he was laughed off the board.  On a previous (since-deleted) reddit account I sarcastically referred to Middleton as ""future all-time great Milwaukee Buck Khris Middleton"" in his first season, and I am still a little bummed out that I can't point to it and pretend I was being serious."
Khris Middleton
This might be a blessing in disguise. Now when they bring in jrue holiday and khris middleton they'll have another roster spot to potentially bring in a bigman
Idk if they will but he does get introduced at home games as ‚ÄòKhris ‚ÄúKha$h Money‚Äù Middleton‚Äô. Shit‚Äôs official now.
Wait what? Are you telling me Khris Middleton is not Korean???
"One thing that seemed emphasized within the Korean commenters was something along the lines of ""Damn how does an all star have such little subscribers"" and ""Even this x-KBL player has more subscribers"". Another thing during a specific radio segment, they compared Joe Johnson (great player, great resume, how little media interest/popularity he got relative to his skill) to Khris Middleton (similar in the way how they received such little attention) hence why I think the youtube channel subscriber count is mentioned."
R is the middle letter for both and Khris MIDDLEton.. Bruh..
I believe that Khris Middleton would easily score 120 points in a game 4 down by one against the Celtics. It's like he's made for such games.
That‚Äôs Khris ‚ÄòBatman‚Äô Middleton according to perk for you
Khris needs all of Jrue‚Äôs touches. Middleton isn‚Äôt cashing only 4 shots off of 20. Jrue needs to facilitate and get the other guys their shots. Don‚Äôt take 20 shots if you gassed my man
"Obviously, in general, better players get more All-Star selections, but rating borderline All-Stars such as Ben Simmons on total All-Star appearances is one of the lazier ways to evaluate players.  First All-Star selections are a half-season award. Second, if you just use All-Stars as a way to measure players like 20 years after the fact by just looking at All-Star appearances, you would think Ben Simmons had a much better year this year than Trae Young or Khris Middleton (both weren‚Äôt All-Stars). But we know that actually isn‚Äôt the case. It‚Äôs because there‚Äôs so much variation in borderline All-Stars that they don‚Äôt mean that much. You can easily argue in all 3 of Ben‚Äôs All-Star years he shouldn‚Äôt have made it if the All-Star game was held at the end of the year."
Sheryl Crow and Khris Middleton!
Khris Middleton is good.

"Khris ""Not Joe Harris"" Middleton"
"He's been clutch for many years and always got into the zone when Giannis desperately needed someone to step up and take some of the load off him.   Following the current mood on Middleton on this sub has always been hilarious. People forget what's he's capable of within one subpar game, switching from ""Middleton is the guy that only got Giannis so far into the post season X years ago"" to ""Middleton's gotta be the worst second option on a contender, the Bucks are neither deep nor top heavy please get Giannis some help"".  The reality is he can run incredibly hot and the way he creates his offense doesn't get impacted by playoff defense the way it does with Giannis. But Khris has also been streaky ever since he joined the league. I think he's a ""low level"" All-NBA player, serviceable All-Star type player with really high peak performances. Last year I argued that he should get all NBA over siakam here and felt validated ever since."
"Giannis will give you monster performances every game, Middleton will be a monster one game and look like a g leaguer the next. It's why Giannis is a 2 time MVP and the real leader of the Bucks, not Middleton. Not a slight on Khris but Giannis is simply better"

Shoutout Pistons legend Khris Middleton
Shout to Devin Booker and Khris Middleton
"That's Khris ""best player on the bucks according to Shaq"" Middleton to you"
If only Middleton was more consistent. Absolutely love Khris and when he's on he's one of my fav players of all time
ok that's fine but what about khris middleton slander? where do we stand on that
Khris Middleton is 1
"Khris ""Kobe Bryant"" Middleton"
I think bucks take game 5 and 6. Khris Middleton seems to have found his rhythm
I love Khris Middleton so much. Gig em! üëç
"Khris ""Michael Jordan"" Middleton"
"1. Refs really let Book play with 7 or 8 fouls. 2. Giannis with a great game and one of the best blocks I've ever seen in a Finals 3. Khris ""Batman"" Middleton, Khris Wayne, Bruce Middleton"
Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton switch shooting powers every game I swear
Giannis is a force every single game even when his team gets trashed he‚Äôs fighting the whole way down. When Middleton shows up every other game or so (almost exclusively home games) the team takes off. Giannis carried that team so hard in game 2 and they still lost big and he did that shit again game 3 in a blowout.  Giannis has consistently huge games but still gets blamed when he shows up and no one else does. Khris has a huge game and then everyone jumps on his bandwagon just to jump off when he lays an egg
This was 2 quarters against the Atlanta hawks/Boston celtics khris middleton
"I know the word 'underrated' is thrown around a lot, but damn Khris Middleton deserves more plaudits than he gets."
Khris ‚ÄúIcyhot‚Äù Middleton and Devin‚ÄùKobe Bryant‚Äù Booker showed up hard tonight
"K. Middleton = fantastic game by Khris, kept the Bucks in the game.  P. Connaughton = huge clutch 3.  Greek Freak = huge block, clutch defensive play.  But.... Giannis committed an inbound violation in the dying seconds that the refs did not see or ignored .... just saying.  Looks like the series will go to 7."
"Khris ""Giannis Antetokounmpo"" Middleton"
Khris ‚ÄúTwo-Face‚Äù Middleton
Ref masterclass ruined by Khris Middleton lmao
"James Khristian Middleton (November 6, 1861 ‚Äì November 28, 1939) was a Canadian-American, physical educator, physician, Christian chaplain, sports coach, and inventor of the game of basketball. After moving to the United States, he wrote the original basketball rule book and founded the University of Kansas basketball program. Middleton lived to see basketball adopted as an Olympic demonstration sport in 1904 and as an official event at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, as well as the birth of the National Invitation Tournament (1938) and the NCAA Tournament (1939).        tl;dr Khris Middleton invented the game of basketball"
Khris ‚ÄúThe Next Kobe Bryant‚Äù Middleton.
"What an all-around game from Giannis. The greats effect the game any way they can, especially when they may not have their best night scoring.   Khris Middleton is such a bizarre study of a player. So exciting to watch when he‚Äôs on his game. Such a hard worker, so thrilled for him to have this moment.   Book is a bucket. Chris Paul detractors are gonna have a field day with this one. Sets up such an exciting game 5 narrative. Miss me with the declining ratings, this was a game made for hoop fanatics. Three more, please!"
"Khris Middleton in clutch games: 500 points, 400 assists, 350 rebounds 69-69 shooting."
"Watching the suns bitch and whine when they lose is honestly so satisfying. Everyone on that team but Bridges, Ayton and Cam Johnson seems like a prick.    Devin Booker is closer to Khris Middleton than he is to any top 10 player."
"If Khris Middleton changed his name to Giannis, then yeah I guess"
Imagine losing a series to Khris Middleton
Khris Middleton is good
Khris Middleton flipped the coin before the game and he got heads
Tonight we saw god disguised as Khris Middleton
We‚Äôll we‚Äôve officially had ‚ÄúThe Khris Middleton Game‚Äù
cp played awful tonight while book has one of his best games of the playoffs. Books 5th foul was not a foul while he should‚Äôve fouled out with 5 minutes left and they didn‚Äôt call it.   Hats off to khris middleton tonight. This game is gonna go to 7 since no one can win on the road.
"Khris Middleton is the definition of ""Never on schedule but always on time"""
"Khris ""Prime Michael Jordan"" Middleton"
"Been in a coma for six days, is Khris Middleton the greatest player of all time?"
What a game holy god. What a block by Giannis and what a performance from Khris Middleton wow oh wow
khris middleton has officially scored 40 points in a finals game. incredible. love that for him
Devin Booker?  More like Khris Middleton.
KHRIS MIDDLETON STEPPED THE FUCK UP. TAKE THAT BITCHES!
Where were you when Khris Middleton single handedly saved the last shreds of credibility this league has?
Khris ‚ÄúCeltics ‚ÄúSuns Killer‚Äù Killer‚Äù Middleton
I guess without Lebron in the finals we now know Khris Middleton is the new king
HEY GUYS OUR VERSION OF KHRIS MIDDLETON SHOWED UP TONIGHT
Khris Middleton is actually pretty eloquent ngl
we just watched one of the greatest NBA Finals duels of all time between Devin Booker and Khris Middleton
Khris Middleton is the best player in the NBA.
"Celtics Khris Middleton just saved the NBA from one of the biggest officiating scandals ever, lol"
Khris Middleton is a ^work^horse that's what I meant not that he looks like a horse.  . . . . . . . . . . .  Horse face!
If Khris Middleton shows up next game and not khRiS mIddLetoN then watch out
I never want to hear any Khris Middleton slander ever again.
KHRIS MIDDLETON AND DEVIN BOOKER HAVE 40 POINTS EACHH IN A FINALS GAME
We‚Äôll we‚Äôve officially had ‚ÄúThe Khris Middleton Game‚Äù
Khris Middleton is a horse
Khris Middleton= MJ tonight ü§∑
I wish Khris Middleton was Paul George
Khris Middleton put Holiday in the backpack for this
‚Äúthe khris middleton game‚Äù
Khris Middleton is a better player than Jimmy Butler. Period.
J Lamb Khris Middleton THJ Tony Snell  One thing in common: catch and shoot gods of 2k14
He also contributed by being traded for Khris Middleton. I think it's been broken since but he also set the record for most points in a game for a rookie.
Carl Malone. Khris Bosh. Chris Middleton.
Lebron has never improved as much as Khris Middleton every year
Shout-out to the Jrue Crew!  &gt; It's between Jrue Holiday... and Khris Middleton.
"No, you just have a bullshit definition of superteam. You're saying if a team drafts Kawhi, Steph, and Lebron it's not a superteam just because they drafted them? BULLSHIT.  &gt;A team formed overnight by free agency or players demanding trades.  Tell me how the Bucks got Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, PJ Tucker, Bobby Portis, and Robin Lopez. You know, their entire rotation."
I mean think about what u said for a sec. they exploit all defensive players. What‚Äôs the difference in exploiting a bad defensive player? You still get the same two points. They don‚Äôt magically get more points cuz they get a favorable matchup. U dont think Khris middleton can destroy Trae every time down the floor? Embiid? Why didnt they do it then? Cuz there‚Äôs this thing called the team and team defense which is VASTLY more important than individual defense. Especially a PGs
I want to use this thread to end all McCollum for Middleton trade ideas. Bucks are not trading Khris. He is the better player.
"Anyone in here posting stats saying Dirk's career and 2011 playoff run is dwarfed by what Giannis just did are individuals who didn't watch basketball in 2011. The Mavs had just about the toughest road of ANY team in nba history that year. While they had step up performances to get through it they did not have Khris Middleton or Jrue Holiday level players, period.   Giannis had an incredible performance but it was not better than post prime Dirk beating the healthy Lakers, Heat and Blazers. On par sure because what he did this post-season was remarkable but to put it clearly above Dirk is recency bias newphewesque garbage. ü§°"
"Sorry, 0/4.   &gt;!damian LilLard!&lt; &gt;!bam AdeBayo!&lt; &gt;!kevin DuRant!&lt; &gt;!khris MiddleTon!&lt;"
"Giannis had 8 less points on 12 less shots during the game KD dropped 48. And if you‚Äôre saying KD defended Middleton well, didn‚Äôt Khris have 38 on sixteen fucking shots one game?    For the record I think Giannis and KD were probably about even (with the slight edge to KD given the circumstances) but to say you can‚Äôt see an argument is just being willfully stupid"
" Because his team didn't start with Khris Middleton, an outside shooter who can also create his own shot.  Because his team didn't get Brook Lopez for free, and turn him into an elite stretch 5.  Because his team didn't get a solid contributor in Pat Connaughton for free.  And thats before they became a KD shoe size away from brutally overpaying for PJ Tucker and Jrue Holiday."
"Lol it wasn‚Äôt a horrible roster and he‚Äôs best friends with ADs agent he knew AD was coming to LA the whole time.  Kobe didn‚Äôt leave the lakers when they were starting Smush Parker every game and MJs team was far from stacked the bulls were basically a joke before Jordan turned them into one of the best franchises in the sport.  Giannis was constantly told to leave Milwaukee and force a trade because Khris Middleton wasn‚Äôt considered good enough to win a ring as the second best player Giannis said fuck it and won it anyways.  Lebron never won it with a guy like Middleton as his Robin.  He needed Wade, Irving, and AD"
"Giannis would literally run through them. Joel Embiid makes it harder but in the post-season the Bucks have 3 of the best 4 players if Khris Middleton continues being a closer and Jrue playing D on the prime perimeter scorer - which the Sixers don‚Äôt have a reliable one besides Tobias, who is as streaky or streaker than Khris"
"After these playoffs, Khris Middleton!"
Khris Middleton is only just getting started in his conquest of the Boston Celtics
Khris Middleton has 40 point playoff games. No 1st stint Lebron teammate ever did that.
"He didn't need to do Dirk like that lol. Man gave 20 years to Dallas and chipped in one of the hardest title runs in recent memory. No other All-Stars... no Khris Middleton or Jrue Holiday type guys on that roster either. If anything, isn't that more impressive to beat Lebron, Wade, and Bosh?"
Have you not learned your lesson nephew? People were saying similar things about NBA Champion and US Olympic star Khris Middleton.
Khris Middleton and Micheal jordan
"right, so the fact that kd is still quicker than middleton right now at 7ft, while middleton is 6'8, he certainly would be quicker and a better than khris middleton still even if he was his height"
"It's not bad in scale, but Jason Kidd telling Khris Middleton to deliberately miss a FT 3 points up in the closing seconds of a game has got to be there."
I feel like every year there‚Äôs some dumb excuse people try to use to discredit the champions.  I guess this year it‚Äôs KD‚Äôs shoe size.    Giannis just had a 50 point 5X5 in the last game of the finals.  Jrue Holliday and Khris Middleton played out of their minds.  They deserved it.  It‚Äôs okay to admit it.
"Wade in his last year had almost identical numbers per 36 minutes as middleton and was higher defensive rating than khris has ever been. Mind you wade was 100nyears old too.. You only seem to understand the ""big 3"" of stats and not all analytics. I'd gladly take 3 points less if that denies 10 or more in the other side of the court."
The disrespect to Khris 'His Airness' Middleton.
Khris Middleton - MJ Kobe hybrid
"Superteam is the same way a musical supergroup is formed‚Äîestablished artists or members from huge bands join each other knowing they're already great performers to form a ""supergroup"" that already has a heightened status. Khris Middleton and Giannis are both solid players, but they didn't join the Bucks with that status being known. They developed into this. It's also worth mentioning that Giannis is the only real superstar on the Bucks. It's not like three superstar players from different teams coming together. I think superteams are usually considered when like a superstar player joins an established powerful team shown to be already capable of winning the playoffs. So that's why even though Jrue Holiday is a key piece to the Bucks championship roster (who previously met trouble and meltdowns in the playoffs) and he only was traded to them this year, he's not really like that superstar caliber, just a really beautiful find for their rotation and the exact piece they needed to take them over the top. Lmao i just kept typing sorry for the essay"
"Khris Middleton is definitely worth more than kyrie, and I‚Äôm saying this as a kyrie defender. Khris brings a bit more to the table in length and defense"
"It wasn't just Giannis.  It was paying Khris Middleton a max.  It was signing Brook Lopez when he was fired by Los Angeles, and then giving him a raise.  It was acquiring Pat Connaughton for nothing. It was acquiring Bobby Portis.   It was drafting Done Di Vincenzo, and it was getting rid of Thon Maker when he turned into what people thought Giannis would become.  It was backing up the truck for Eric Blesoe, and then backing it up again for Jrue Holliday.  Just Giannis doesn't win a chip."
"Khris Middleton. Your brother could quit his job, because Khris would provide all the khash money theyd ever need."
Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton for Lillard and CJ
"Bucks propose Khris Middleton for Kyrie Irving, and the Nets take it just to watch Giannis leave"
Khris Middleton will forever strike fear to the core of my very being
Bogdan Bogdanoviƒá &gt; Khris Middleton
"Bryn Forbes - Game 2 Miami  Brook Lopez -  Game 4 Miami, Game 5 Atlanta  Khris Middleton - Game 3 Brooklyn, Game 6 Brooklyn, Game 3 Atlanta, Game 6 Atlanta, Game 4 Phoenix  Giannis - Game 4 Brooklyn, Game 7 Brooklyn, basically the entire Finals  Jrue - Game 6 Atlanta, Game 5 Phoenix  And that's with just focusing on box scores and focusing on one guy per game unless there were two or more legitimately stellar performances. Add in major plays on defense and things that don't show up on the box score, and I think that list expands to cover basically everyone that saw meaningful play time."
"Khris Middleton is probably staying there his whole career tbh, would've been cool if he was drafted there to say he was there his whole career"
"Contracts are a terrible way to judge super teams. They have one all star level player in Khris Middleton and a non all star in Jrue, that is not a super team. Gianni's definitely got lucky that he got drafted into a competent franchise that was willing to make the moves to compete  but to say this team is a super team is ridiculous."
khris middleton won't get his jersey retired lol
"In defense of LeBron, the Cavs did him dirty. Their dumbass owner tried to circumvent the CBA to get Carlos Boozer on a lowball deal which led to Boozer becoming an unrestricted free agency and then leaving the Cavs to Utah.  This is the equivalent of the Bucks getting rid of Khris Middleton and never replacing him and then getting Giannis a 38 year old Marc Gasol as his co-star."
Yeah NBA legends and game breakers Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton üôÑüôÑ
Jeff green is strictly one dimensional and if his shot doesn‚Äôt hit he‚Äôs not giving you anything. Jrue and Middleton at least provide defense consistently and they‚Äôre both better playmakers. Jeff green had 7 assists the whole series. Jrue had 19 and 8 in game 5. 21/8/5 with 4 steals in game 6. Khris had 35 and 5 in game 3. Come on man.
"Get this:  Holiday, Middleton, and Booker will all be on the private flight to Tokyo together.  Could be an awkward flight!   From Yahoo news:  USA Basketball will have a private plane ready for not just Booker, but two of his Finals opponents ‚Äî the Bucks' Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton ‚Äî who will, no doubt, be in far better moods."
And having the first g league player to be an all star in Khris Middleton is pretty rare too.
no kd is also quicker than khris middleton so he would still be better
"You have phrased this in a really passive aggressive way.  Anyhow, AD isn't as good as Giannis. AD's a top tier #2, but he's not a #1. Also the Pelicans never got the injury luck for the opponents that the Bucks got. Brooklyn was this year's GSW and they were severely injured. In our best year, in that GSW series we were the ones missing an all star to injury.  The Bucks have a more complete roster than the Pels ever did, for sure. But Cousins in his prime and Jrue Holiday are comparable to Khris Middleton and...Jrue Holiday for core 3."
"Is Khris Middleton good enough to be the 2nd best player on a championship team? Is Khris Middleton worth a max contract? Yes and Yes. Wrap it up boys, this case is closed."
"Super team is such a loaded term. What would you call a team that has Giannis, Jrue Holliday, and Khris Middleton? A current all star and two former all stars? I respect Giannis for his loyalty but let‚Äôs be honest, he plays on a super team."
And if KD wasn't 7' he'd probably be closer to Khris Middleton than to Jordan.  Giannis has physical gifts.  But he maximized what he had by developing his skills.  And that's made him a champion.
id absolutely refer to him as finals mvp vote receiver khris middleton
"He probably did it to try setting an example for his team. Chris Paul gave zero congratz and was a little cry baby bitch crying on his way to the locker room. Should be interesting seeing Devin Booker, Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton play on the same team during the Olympics."
"1) Giannis Antetokounmpo   2 )Khris Middleton   3) Jrue Holiday   4) PJ Tucker   5)Brooke Lopez   Oh sorry, that's just the starters for the 2021 NBA CHAMPION MILWAUKEE BUCKS"
Lmao Kevin Love and Kyrie as a duo are no better than Khris Middleton and Jrue. What plus player was coming off of their bench? They had solid pieces for this specific teams but there is a reason that the entire bench is essentially out of the league now lol. Also very few championship teams aren‚Äôt maxed out in cap space. Bron made that team super
"&gt; Shaq used to demolish his competition.  Shaq had Kobe...Giannis has Khris Middleton, slight difference there.   [Giannis *is* the Shaq of this era](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jtOOQ43yw4)"
"Time to trade Khris Middleton for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, and Steven Adams because you can't be a luxury tax team in a small market."
"There‚Äôs a difference between having Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh as your other 2 guys, or Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson as your 2 guys (3 with draymond even) than‚Ä¶. Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton. How are you gonna say that good team building is a ‚Äúsuper team‚Äù?"
"No no no the media said constantly that we couldn‚Äôt put a team around Giannis. Maxing Khris Middleton was a mistake, no way was he good enough to be a second option on a championship team."
"Slightly off topic but mildly interesting:  - redemption arc Cameron Payne played in zoom freak 1s  - during the regular season, Khris Middleton played in the 'infamous' mambacitas"
"Whoever downvoted my comment does not watch the bucks or know anything about them. If you seriously think that  the bucks would have traded Middleton for someone like cj McCollum, a smaller less proficient scorer because they lost to the nets is plain dumb.  It‚Äôs an absurd suggestion.  One, mccolllum is not at the level of khris and two, khris and too close for management to trade him without Giannis‚Äôs consent."
"You said that coach Monty was an idiot for using kaminsky to guard Giannis. I said they didn‚Äôt. You insisted that Giannis was ‚Äúputting him in a blender‚Äù. I outlined every point Giannis scored with frank on the floor to show that you were wrong.  And what was that highlight supposed to show me? Giannis in transition with Ayton getting blown by? Stop back pedaling.   And what personnel do they have to build the wall? They tried it the first three games and it didn‚Äôt work at all, they got lucky that Middleton and jrue were dog shit games 1 and 2. Giannis was still scoring at will.  Game 6 they made a decision to shut down jrue and khris(which they did a fantastic job with), forcing Giannis to beat them. The game plan was fine, they held the bucks to 105, if Booker and ayton just play slightly better then they win that game.  As a former coach you should know that it‚Äôs always a ‚Äúpick your best option‚Äù against these teams, somebody is going to go off. There will be downsides to any decision they make"
"Giannis and Khris remind me a lot of the Jordan/Pippen championship teams. Not necessarily in terms of talent, but how they were both basically homegrown and stayed on their teams and had management build around them. And Middleton being a second round pick and G League guy, reminds me a lot of Pippen getting drafted from Div II. I know Milwaukee isn't the team that drafted Khris, but same idea.   These two have grown together for the past eight years, good they stuck around to win a title for the team that had faith in them."
Khris Middleton and two Antetokoumnpos
Khris Middleton avgd 24 pts and Jrue avgd 17.6 pts. In 2011 Second best player in Dallas was the Jet and he avgd 18 pts so who had better supporting cast?
"Khris Middleton made the championship-icing shot, expect him to call Giannis unclutch"
Khris 'Unsung Hero' Middleton.
"I dunno about that but as much as Giannis was a monster this series and all playoffs, the whole Bucks supporting cast was crazy this series and all playoffs. Like, Middleton and Holiday did everything they needed to do. Lopez was great. Portis and *Connaughton* showed up.  But honestly if you told me Khris Middleton would be the second option on a championship team like four years ago I would be like ""Yeah, okay buddy."" No disrespect but it's pretty wild."
"If it's a team built through draft Then why did they trade all those picks for holiday?..... Look I'm happy for him but this he didn't join a super team to win the ring is a bullshit argument...... He has had Eric Bledsoe,  Malcom Brigdon, Khris Middleton now Jrue Holiday...these are all good players in their own right..... I do not like the comparisons though coz Lebron had no one of this Caliber on the Cavs team when he left for Miami.... and he was facing Boston celtics with 4 HOF and Giannis has been shut down completely in post season which Did not happen to KD and Lebron.....I get that he played well but he did not go through Nets at full strength.....I completely hate this false argument that bucks did it in some real way....the Bucks have moved so many pieces to cover up Giannis weakness"
Khris Middleton is a borderline superstar.
"Khris ""Half GOAT, Half G-League"" Middleton"
"I wouldn't be surprised if I see 'Should we trade Middleton for....' post this offseason in the Bucks sub. Every year for the past 5+ years there has been at least one post a week it seems that asks that question, both during the season and off season. If it wasn't for Giannis, Khris would have been the best player this team has had since Ray Allen and it always pisses me off when our fanbase treats him like he's nothing."
i would love if people posted more clips like this.  btw where does khris middleton rank all time after his ring and how does 2 finals losses back to back effect jae crowder's legacy?
Suns won games 1 and 2 with Khris Middleton shooting 0 free throws on like 40 shot attempts lol

"I'm happy that Giannis won. Especially PJ Tucker because he was drafted by the Raptors, Lopez because he's Lopez, Portis for being crazy eyes, Jrue for being so damn amazing on defense, also loved watching him on pelicans. Never thought this day would come for him. Khris Middleton being a nobody to a somebody! Divencenzo because he was sick in the last part of college, Thanasis because he has more every than the Energizer Bunny. Giannis I always wished you'd be a raptor because of Masai, but you proved everyone wrong for being so loyal. You are amazing!  Anyone else I forgot, I forgot. Goodnight!"

"If you gave Lebron players of Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday and Brook Lopez's caliber during his first stint in Cleveland he never would have had to leave to win one. His best teammates his first go around were Zyndrunas Ilgauskas and Mo Williams."
"Big market team have a high chance of winning a championship, because they can attract FAs or disgruntle player to get in trade. Bucks got a generational talent in Giannis, Khris Middleton who can be 2nd best player, big gamble with Jrue Holiday trade, and the Super Team on Nets got injured. The Bucks took advantage of the situation to win their chip, and nobody can deny Giannis, Middleton, and Jrue their chip. Can you believe it Mike Budenholzer is a championship coach now?"
Giannis had a godly season and deserved everything but I still believe had the nets been healthy then they would have won it all and the bucks would have cleaned house starting with coach bud and khris middleton. Insane how a few injuries can save your job.
Remember when you said Khris Middleton couldn't be the 2nd best player on a championship team?
Khris Middleton definitely deserved some piece of fmvp consideration but unfortunately that‚Äôs not how the voting works. Legendary series from both guys especially Giannis
CJ said he thought Giannis was finals mvp 2 minutes after saying Khris deserved some votes.  He was just trying to praise Middleton and everyone is acting like he hates Giannis now.
At the time yes Brandon Knight was more ‚Äúvaluable‚Äù than Khris Middleton. Most second round picks don‚Äôt become All Stars nonetheless ones off the bench who play for the Pistons.
"Yo, wait, Devin Booker has to fly on a private flight to Tokyo on Friday with just Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton. He is squarely in hell"
you like Khris Middleton after all he's done to yall over the years??
"Naaah. I can't in good conscience rank Middleton over Butler. Giannis is a fucking load to handle warping defensive coverage, and that allows Khris to drop some 1v1 faders over meh defenders or get clean 3's off.  It's close, but Butler is still the better player. We can't just pretend that the Heat didn't beat the 1st seed Bucks last year."
Khris Middleton about to toss the Larry O'Brien to Giannis from airplane to airplane to one-up the other Bucs.
Khris Middleton is never letting go of that trophy
Khris Middleton has such an adorable smile.
"Khris Middleton is the 2nd option on a fucking championship team.  Never really thought I‚Äôd be saying that, it‚Äôs wild as fuck. Bucks only gonna get better next season, playing without stress is such a performance enhancer."
"Khris Middleton, bring that trophy here boi"
Somali brother khris Middleton winning on eid you love to see it
Sim is Khris Middleton confirmed
Former Pistons Great Khris Middleton
"Can we rename Khris Middleton as Scottie Pippen 2.0? The similarities are uncanny, and now there's a title, too."
And put some respect on Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton
Love the dude trying to tell Khris Middleton where to go like he has some kind of authority
then Khris ‚ÄúBlack Klay Thompson‚Äù Middleton
"It means a lot for small markets too. Giannis says fuck it to the big markets and stays with his original team. He fucking won with Khris Middleton as his second best player. Middleton is great, but in terms of historic teams, he pales in comparison. It's a great win for so many reasons."

"Well 3 of them (Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday, Booker) just flew in from US the day prior after ending the NBA finals the previous Tuesday."
NBA All-Stars?   Devin Booker  Kevin Durant  Jerami Grant  Zach LaVine  JaVale McGee  Jrue Holiday  Bam Adebayo  Khris Middleton  Damian Lillard  Jayson Tatum  Draymond Green  Keldon Johnson  There are no better players in USA than these? Only one I even know is Kevin Durant.
Khris Middleton sat on the bench for no reason
Khris Middleton got off a 15 hour flight after the NBA Finals like two days ago. I think being worn out is a lot more likely for most people than becoming weirdly super human the way Jrue did.
Should‚Äôve started with JRue and Khris Middleton
that's what you get when you let Kevin Durant chuck up bricks in the clutch while NBA Champion Khris Middleton sits on the bench
&gt;Pop playing Keldon Johnson heavy minutes while Jerami Grant and Khris Middleton are wasting away on the bench. Him and Colangelo gotta go.  Bumping this comment.

"But really tho, DNP for Khris Middleton?"
Khris Middleton so he could watch both of them at the same time
Khris Middleton still hungover confirmed?  He'd be the perfect KD sub right?
"Mikal showed some on ball creation flashes in these playoffs and is a really great shooter. I won‚Äôt be shocked to see him turn into a great offensive player in a Khris Middleton role, not that level just the role."
World Champions Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday.
Kyrie was averaging current day Khris Middleton stats.

"Come on man it‚Äôs basketball not geopolitical issues or solving hunger in Africa. We know who can hoop and who can‚Äôt. We have all the stats available to us now, we have unlimited film on the internet, there are hundreds of YouTube channels that do great breakdowns on the game of basketball if you‚Äôre really interested in the X‚Äôs and O‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt need some vanilla analyst to tell me that Khris Middleton is good at basketball and very underrated, or that DeAndre Ayton has been very solid in these playoffs."
"ngl this sub and sports media in general have killed khris before this season. That's one of the reasons why Giannis re-signing with Milwaukee was such a huge story in free agency, the whole narrative that he won't be able to win with Middleton as his number 2"
"We got bailed out by Khris Middleton... I don't know how to explain this to you, but when you go from down 7 (a lead that increased when Trae went down), to up 11, in a matter of 6 minutes, solely because of one player in Middleton, there's no bigger reason you won.  Btw the Clippers, as great as they were, got lucky with Conley not being healthy, an all-star level player, and Gobert gets spoon fed, yes, but is damn good on converting when he is spoonfed points. Conley creates 10% of Gobert's points in the regular season (lmfao), Gobert relies HEAVILY (so does the Jazz offense) on Mike Conkley's playmaking, the Jazz basically had to play without 2 all-stars on the offensive side of the glass, and they still went up 2-0"
"I hate this attitude.    &gt; ""We could've very easily got to the last game ... and Devin Booker saying, 'Man, we lost, I'm pissed off, I'm out,' or Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday saying, 'We just won a championship, I want to celebrate and stay home with my family, I'm out,'"" Green said.  No, you don't easily do that and anyone who does should be criticized for it.  You shouldn't have a lot of respect for people doing what they're supposed to do.  Committing to your word is a basic principle one should have."
"Great response! I understand your reasoning on your player tiers. I had Booker in the mid 20s since I rank players differently. I rank players looking at their role and how well they are in that role. For example, I would rather have Booker as the first option over Middleton and CP3, but I would rank Khris and CP3 as the second option over Devin as the first. But I understand your methodology and do think I should take more consideration into that when ranking."
"&gt;Khris Middleton scored 20 points that 4th quarter in game 3  I'm sure that had nothing to do with the Hawks having crippled Trae Young on the court playing 4v5 on defense; or the Hawks' 2nd or 3rd best player and best defender, Deandre Hunter being out for the entire series.  &gt;I love Trae and the Hawks but they was not gonna win that game  It's just laughable to say this with such certainty. Trae had 32 points on 19 shots going into the 4th quarter, where he then scored 3 points on 1/4 shooting after the injury.   &gt;After game 4 Bucks without Giannis straight up just outplayed the Hawks pretty simple  Well yeah, Trae is their entire offense and he was never even close to 100% for the rest of the series."

Fun fact about lebron amd Khris Middleton: neither of them are Dame or Pg. why did you bring them up?
"If you want to judge a player purely based on their teams accomplishments then that‚Äôs your first error. Dame is simply a much more talented basketball player. It‚Äôs like comparing Lebron to Khris Middleton, you don‚Äôt have to bring up stats or achievements because everyone knows Lebron is the better player, it‚Äôs not up for debate. Same case here, ask 30 GM‚Äôs which player is better and they‚Äôre taking Dame. Only people putting PG ahead of Dame are blind homer Clipper fans."
"I mean, Khris Middleton was a shot in the dark and been with Giannis for 8 years and they were the 8th seed prior to the year BroLo joined. If you want to be technical, sure, it‚Äôs not. But if we‚Äôre questioning the Bucks‚Äô roster construction,then how many teams in history drafted their core?"
Khris Middleton is a good perimeter defender as well just not Glue Holiday good.
"Probably not. I‚Äôm not gonna totally shit on Milwaukee it‚Äôs a cool place but it‚Äôs not LA, Brooklyn, Miami, Atlanta etc. Also they‚Äôre paying 3 players a TON of money so unless it‚Äôs like a Carmelo type ‚Äústar‚Äù there‚Äôs no way they can afford to do that with a Kawhi, KD, Lebron etc. There‚Äôs also the factor of Khris and Giannis not being the most vocal people. I think recruiting is a big part and I just don‚Äôt think Giannis or Middleton are interested in doing that just based on how they act and how reserved they are."
"Khris Middleton is indisputably a ""real"" outside shooter."
"Literally 90 percent of the players to come through Detroit.  I thought signing Chauncey Billups in 2002 was a waste of money because they already had Chucky Atkins.  My first reaction when the Pistons traded Jerry Stackhouse to the Wizards for a young Richard Hamilton was, ""That's all we got?!""  I celebrated and high-fived my friend when the Pistons drew the No. 2 overall pick because we knew that meant we were getting Darko Milicic, who we were both certain was going to be a godsend.   I thought Rodney Stuckey would be the Pistons' point guard of the future.  I thought Brandon Knight would be the Pistons' point guard of the future.  I thought Reggie Jackson would be the Pistons' point guard of the future.   And I didn't really care when Khris Middleton got traded because he and Kim English were basically interchangeable to me at that point and I figured neither would be in the league for long."
Trade jrue for Steph curry and khris Middleton for Kevin durant
Giannis and Khris middleton off the bench probs too. That's deadly.
"You are very wrong, they got a MVP Superstar in Giannis, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday are All-Stars level players, Brook Lopez and PJ Tucker are excellent role players. Align with that Bobby Portis, Pat Connaughton and Bryn Forbes who are decent role players.  It is very difficult to make a team as deep as that. Most of the teams that have 1 or more superstars, don\`t have a bench as good and tall as Milwaukee.  And they got lucky their biggest opponent is this playoff, who was Brooklyn, 2 of their 3 best players got injured..."
"Feels like this year's draft prospects are trying to one-up each other as basketball hipsters. For too long we have had youngsters saying they look up to MJ, Kobe, even Lebron... so this year we got a Khris Middleton shoutout, and now some Christian Wood respect"
"Zion can potentially be better than Giannis offensively, defensive may not be close. Ingram should become a tier or 2 better than Khris Middleton. He's not a fringe allstar, he's an all star talent with superstar potential."
"Disagree.  A two guard that‚Äôs exceptional at making tough shots and mediocre at defense? Where have seen that before? Sounds pretty close to Middleton.  Not saying that there‚Äôs another Giannis, but Embiid is pretty close to having that same two way dominant effect.   Pair a shot making guard like CJ with elite defensive personnel like the Sixers do, and he would for sure be good enough.  For reference, the number #2 players on the four conference finals teams this year were Reggie fucking Jackson, DeAndre Ayton, John fucking Collins, and Khris Middleton.  Only one of those dudes has ever made an all star game and they have zero all-nba team selections between them."
Khris Middleton look like he 35 going on 50
"And you're also clearly lying about the top post after beating the Nets being about Harden, as anyone can see by looking at the top posts in that sub for the year: https://np.reddit.com/r/MkeBucks/top/?sort=top&amp;t=year  Just going through the top 100 for posts around that time, I first see the Game 7 post-game thread, a meme about Brook Lopez's Game 7 turnover that almost lost the series, an appreciation post for Khris Middleton, a post about PJ Tucker going through his old Rockets teammates, and a picture of Bud looking like he might have a heart attack because of how Game 7 went.  Finally, after all that (and maybe a few other non-Harden related posts I skipped over), there's one joking post about Harden not getting further in the playoffs after joining a super team."
"\#11, #12, #14, #18 are the most talented. But most likely #12 would win between all these because they have a combination of size (AD, Draymond, Middleton) for rebounding, Shooting (Damian, Khris), slashing with Beal, and at least *some* playmaking with Draymond and lillard. AD and Draymond would make the interior defense legendary, but Lillard would handicap the perimeter defense a bit.   \#18 has insane playmaking potential but not enough rebounding. #14 is really good but not enough shooting. The lane would be too clogged. #11 is the most stacked offensively but too small."
Lmao at Khris Middleton not even making the list of players despite being on the team at the time. We really thought he was no one until like 2017 at the earliest.
Khris Middleton is a solid top 25 player. No question
Khris Middleton is not to low that's just recency bias until the playoffs this year no one would have even had him on this list.
Bitch who do you think Khris Middleton is
It is some good work but think bam is too low. Kyrie is too high. Khris Middleton is too low.  Julius Randle is too high.
Kuz is just the worse half of Khris Middleton.
Said everybody about Khris Middleton this year or Kyle Lowry in 2019 or Jason Terry in 2011... I could go on and on.
"I watched Middleton a whooole lot the last two years he was in college.  He didn‚Äôt get a lot of chances to score and I‚Äôm willing to bet a large portion of his three attempts were on broken plays trying to beat the buzzer.  That team was really weird and was frankly extremely bad on offense - every possession they‚Äôd run pick and rolls at the elbow until the PG got a good look or a decent pass into the paint, but the guards were one of a guy who is 5‚Äô11‚Äù (pretty sure with his shoes on) or a guy who was very talented but couldn‚Äôt shoot, so opposing defenses never respected them and focused on keeping the ball out of the paint.  This was when the shot clock was 35 seconds, so they could do this like three times per possession.   Watching them try to score points was like pulling teeth.  Occasionally they‚Äôd run something for a wing, but Khris took a while to learn to assert himself in those situations (it really looked like he struggled with his confidence in college despite very clearly being talented) and the other guy (Elston Turner) oozed confidence so he would take over a lot.  Outside of when they‚Äôd pass out to him because a play was busted, you hardly ever got to see Khris go to work.  On the rare occasions he did he just cooked everyone, it was surreal.  I remember asking people if I was crazy to think he looked like Kevin Durant out there.  Super happy it worked out for him, but it would also be nice if Aggie basketball managed to get the most out of a great player while he was still on campus for once."
"Imagine watching Khris ""Prime MJ"" Middleton drop 40 in the finals and then completely forget how to shoot a basketball a week later.  Played pretty good tonight, though."
"The argument was Bron didn‚Äôt have help like Kobe or Jordan. He needed to find his Pippen, his Gasol or his Khris Middleton. But he went FAR BEYOND that. He went for Wade, Anthony Davis and Kyrie plus other players. I‚Äôm not continuing this convo. We get it. You love LeBron and you want to have his children."
Yea‚Ä¶with super teams. Jordan and Kobe would‚Äôve won with Anthony Davis too. Let me know when Bron wins with Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton as his teammates and he has to drop 50 in Game 7.
‚ÄúMostly iso guys and we're about to add Devin Booker and Khris Middleton lmao. Jesus help us.‚Äù
Patty Mills will be our Khris Middleton stopper apparently. Dude stripped him on back to back possessions.
NBA champ Khris Middleton kinda embarrassing me today
Fun fact: Khris Middleton is the owner of the team Nathan Sobey of Australia plays for
"Nathan Sobey tryna guard Khris Middleton, nice try bud.  Khris Middleton owned him both in scoring the bucket and in having a part ownership share of Sobey's team the Brisbane Bullets."
I would get khris Middleton in and attach him to joe ingles‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt give easy switches to him
"The answer is Khris Middleton. He's disgusting when he's shooting tight contested shots, shit it feels like he shoots them better"
It's not that uncommon when the second option is a good shooter and the opponent can't stop focusing the whole defense on the 1st option no matter if they have a hot shooting night. Klay Tompson did the same thing multiple times and they couldn't do anything about it because the whole defense had to be set on Curry at all times. Just like that you can't double Khris Middleton or Jrue because it's suicide not having multiple defenders in the paint to slow down Giannis.
&gt;So the main difference between the Champion Bucks and the AD pelicans was Khris Middleton.  is this a troll
"I mean, you almost have a point.   And Khris Middleton is criminally underrated."
"Ngl Stephs name musta been in my head cause I didn‚Äôt even mean to type Steph lol, im on my work break and meant Khris Middleton. Paul George is another"
"Which is dumb. People judge super teams based off of names or how they formed instead of performance.   Heat only under performed 2011, but after that wade wasn‚Äôt the same.   Like khris Middleton in the last playoffs was better than wade in 12 and definitely 2013, but wade is a far bigger name and at his peak was mvp level, so nobody cares."
Their teacher? Khris Middleton
Khris Middleton/Boston Celtics
"His 3 point shot was so inconsistent that he made more threes then some scrubs named Trae Young and Steph Curry  Edit: I dunno why I typed Steph, meant Khris Middleton"
By scrabble value:  Jrue Holiday: 25  Khris Middleton: 25  Giannis Antetokounmpo: 28  Donte DiVincenzo: 31
Without the bubble Khris Middleton would have made the club 2 seasons ago.  Dude was like two missed 2point field goals away while averaging 22ppg.  Middleton had an incredible year and should have been 3rd team all nba over jaylen brown
Just realized Khris Middleton is wearing #8. The wannabe Michael Redd meme continues.
&gt;Jimmy is more impactful than Middleton. You wouldn't take a Saric over Draymond b/c of shooting would you?  The gap between Draymond and Saric makes it a dumb example. Khris is a pretty elite 3nD player with similar levels of passing/rebounding/IQ. Warriors need spacing more than anything.
Dudes not even better than khris Middleton
"Bluntly, Devin Booker played his heart out in the NBA finals, lost, and then got on a plane to Tokyo.  Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday could have partied for a month in Milwaukee. They were on a plane to Tokyo as well.  Kevin Durant is the best basketballer on the planet (and, yeah, Im a bucks fan. Father time is undefeated, and the future belongs to Giannis. But right now ? Its KD). After a rough ECF loss where he left his heart on the court, he's there too.  So. They are all American athletes.  And as an Australian, I'm proud they are there. We will need to go through them for the gold medal, and there is no better way than to face the best."
"Fiba is so weird. Stephando Currubio puts up 38, doing it in every way.  Meanwhile Khris Middleton is a mix of prime MJ/Kobe/Lebron in the finals 2 weeks ago, but can't hit an open warm up jump this entire olympics."
Off night Khris Middleton may be the worst player in basketball haha
Khris Middleton from time to time
Can you be vs. Celtics Khris Middleton?
"&gt;5 years ago the Warriors were 73-9, Kevin Durant hadn‚Äôt signed 3 contracts with 2 different teams, and the Lakers, 76ers, Nets, Suns, and Bucks were all terrible.  I get what you're saying, but those types of shifts aren't really changing the Cavs future right now.  To offer a comparison, take Khris Middleton.  Bucks signed him coming off a 41-41 season, where Khris was the 3rd leading scorer at 13.4 PPG, behind Brandon Knight and Michael Carter Williams.  His 5 years/$70M was comparable then to what 5 years/$100M would be for Allen this year.  But that's what small market teams need to do.  Lebron isn't coming back (again), and the Cavs need to collect long-term assets that might turn into something.  If they believe Allen is a *potential* good pairing with Mobley and/or Sexland, then hell yeah keep him here 5 years, let's see what we've got.  Capela would be another example.  Didn't transcend to superstar, but stayed a good version of himself, and because of the 5 year contract, was a valuable contract to trade away when the Rockets went into rebuild mode."
"Not even khris middleton good whos an 2nd option on a championship team who can be your teams best iso scorer. Simmons is a role player, the 4th to 5th option on offense in the half court."
"If they think he‚Äôs that good, why wouldn‚Äôt they just keep him? Nobody else thinks so because he‚Äôs not. He‚Äôs Khris Middleton (and I love KM) good at best."
"That‚Äôs completely untrue.   Every team has 2 max slots, and at the very least one should be used by teams who aren‚Äôt just starting a rebuild.   That means that around the Top-30 players should be receiving a max contract, along with players who are projected to be at least that good.   The only reason why people think only a few players should get maxes is because they compare Jamal Murray and Khris Middleton to Jokic, Giannis, and LeBron; players who value exceed the max."
am i crazy or does he turn into Khris Middleton for a moment
"during the 2016-17 playoff, Khris Middleton played with such severe strep throat that he was unable to swallow or eat solid foods. He developed Abscesses in his throat that were so bad they had to be drained of blood between games. Which sounds just truly awful."
Khris Middleton isn't a 2x MVP though
"&gt;Khris Middleton on the other hand had a probability of 0.002% two season ago, and only has jumped slightly to 0.006%  How the fuck is this model accurate? He's a champion, 2x MVP and will probably have an Olympic Gold by next month. Not saying he's a lock but 0.006%? LMAO"
"Wasn't he guarding the efficient version of khris Middleton    Not hot n cold version, pure regular season middleton"
Khris Middleton
Khris Middleton?
khris middleton
"You can't cherrypick 2 dudes to say BPM is ""bad"". Even then Middleton took 16 shots to score 20 ppg on one of the best offenses in the league, so BPM is pretty on point. It says that khris Middleton's points per possession is middling and that his defense is average. Which I don't disagree with. Ja Morant is bad defensively, and BPM is on point with that. Ja took 15 shots to score 19 ppg and had a 7-3 ast/to ratio, BPM is an advanced stat. It punishes him for shooting 30% behind the arc, 45% from the field, bad turnover ratio, and mediocre points per possession, with bad defense. Lonzos defense is overrated at this point and even if he defends well, Lavine and Vooch should and will pound the ball reducing Lonzo to a fucking spot up shooter. At which point we can get a 3 and D guard for less than 20 mil. And one with more than 2 years of shooting success.."
"2012 had Draymond Green, Khris Middleton, Jae Crowder, Thomas Satoransky, Will Barton and Kyle O'Quinn."
"1. Khris Middleton kills the Celtics constantly   2. Eric Bledsoe‚Ä¶.yikes   3. For all that went right for Rozier, Morris, Horford, Tatum etc for this playoff run and getting to game 7 of the conference finals, it didn‚Äôt replicate the next season with a healthy Kyrie and Hayward back in the lineup"
"Khris Middleton has a good chance to end up being the only player to score 40 points in a finals game and not make the HOF. The only not-active, not HOF player to score that in a finals game is Dwyane Wade who is a lock when actually eligible."
"max player doesn't mean superstar.  &amp;#x200B;  Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton are not on the same level as Giannis, Harden, KD, and Kyrie Irving. They're great players, to be sure, with their own strengths that Harden and Kyrie may not have, and you'd rather have them in some situations (defensively), but they aren't superstars.  &amp;#x200B;  The league has a salary cap. If the NBA had a free market Kyrie and Harden would be making a lot more money than Middleton and Jrue."
People crying about injuries like it‚Äôs unfair makes me laugh. Like a team having KD harden and Kyrie is fair and part of the game but if they have injuries and lose it‚Äôs so unfair. No fucking shit they‚Äôd win if they‚Äôre healthy. No fucking shit they‚Äôd be better than Jrue and Khris Middleton. You guys would just prefer to be Nets bandwagoners and watch them be healthy and sweep the league? And that‚Äôs fair but this isn‚Äôt?
"Sabonis is like Khris Middleton last year. He was probably an undeserving all-star the year before, and now he‚Äôs tryna make All-NBA."
Some might argue Steph elevated his team. Do you think khris Middleton would be an all star without giannis?
"Top 20 is tough.  LeBron, Giannis, Durant, Kahwi, Harden, AD, Doncic, Jokic, Curry, Kyrie, Lillard, Embiid, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum and Rudy Gobert are imo clearly above him. If Chris Paul is still the player he was last year then he's on that list as well. That's seventeen players.  Then you've got a group of Donovan Mitchell, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, Karl-Anthony Towns and Bam Adebayo who are also above him in my opinion. That takes it to 22 already.  Khris Middleton, Ben Simmons, Jamal Murray, Zion Williamson, Trae Young, Siakam and Porzingis would be my next tier. That's where I see Sabonis.  He's imo a top 30 player."
"It's definitely part of the game and it happens all the time. Happened yesterday to Khris Middleton. There are 10 fast moving players on a small court and refs have to be on the floor during a game. If a turnover causes a loose ball or an unexpected steal happens, as in this case, sometimes they are unable to get out of the way in time."
To be fair while Giannis absolutely dominated Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday were great too  So not entirely Giannis vs the world on the NBA finals   And Clippers almost got three wins against these Suns without Kawhi and Lakers without AD and partial LeBron got 2 wins over the Suns.   I'd argue Bucks were better than THAT Clippers team and THAT Lakers team.
"""khris middleton i wanna play with some actual shooters"" - Giannis' hacked twitter account.   I like Khris a lot, but that was funny"
Khris Middleton is so fucking overrated lmfao
"You do realise Team USA brought Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker, Harrison Barnes, Myles Turner, and Khris Middleton to the 2019 World Cup and still finished seventh, right?"
Oh for sure. But it also means guys like Khris Middleton and Jrue are able to create their own shots off the dribble.
"He moves off ball as much as someone like Cj McCollum, MPJ, or Khris Middleton do."
"Lol what? So your hypothetical scenario here is that Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton, competent NBA basketball players, shoot sub-35% TS for *a whole series*, and the Bucks can‚Äôt improve from that.  I would say there‚Äôs a very obvious way to improve from that, but go off."
"Oh so Khris Middleton just needs to shoot a casual 16/23 and the bucks ""probably win"". Lol. Nets in 5 even with no harden."
Do you really think a team whose #2 is Khris Middleton can win the championship?
"Buddy Heild, DeRozan, Khris Middleton, scary Terry"
More like   Blake Griffin randomly dropped 18/14 with good defense after averaging 5/3/2 on 55 TS% vs the Celtics. Khris Middleton had an underwhelming game and the Bucks couldn‚Äôt shoot to save their lives. Giannis hitting 33% of all Bucks threes won‚Äôt cut it either.   But Bud has to play his big guns the vast majority of the game. There is no excuse for a Kevin Durant coming back from an Achilles tear to play 5 more minutes than Giannis and Kyrie 10 more. They have got to take advantage of the games Harden misses if he misses Any more.
"Khris Middleton did not make the all star game this season. Paul George is supposed to be an all NBA caliber player, he didn't play like one."
You mean 2x All-*Star* (including this season) Khris Middleton?
"Great for his standards, bad for a stars standards. He's more comparable to Khris Middleton than a star."
Imagine Luka with a second star even in the Tobias Harris and Khris Middleton tier... Man the Mavs gotta figure out some way to move Kristaps
People are gonna overreact to this game but I think the Bucks just didn't hit shots. If Harden is out this is still a series. Khris Middleton has to be better
"I agree there‚Äôs no excuse for his rotations.  But in regards to last night, they straight up lost because Khris ‚Äúworse-than-Schr√∂der‚Äù Middleton had one of the worst most inefficient games ever"
"Man Bucks D coulda been better just was hitting shots. Killed em. major loss considering no James Harden and they pretty much quit w 4min left. Middleton &amp; Greek have step up challenge of guarding KD as Pelicans fan Jrue Holiday is always guarding people way bigger than him because he's so gifted on ball. But He can't be guarding Lebron, Joker, &amp; KD when you have guys that big and good on Defense. Khris, Greek, PJ, &amp; Lopez all should be able hold they own. Jrue if given Kyrie can keep him in check for 20-25pts."

Khris Middleton back in rare playoff form
This is how it always is once the bucks end up playing a good team that knows what it's doing. Giannis is not a winning player and the bucks aren't a winning team. You ain't winning shit with Khris Middleton as your #2.
what are you talking about now? nothing just like khris middleton  salt salt salt salt salt
His teammates let him down especially Khris Middleton
If the Boston Celtics didn't exist I am convinced Khris Middleton would be making like $8M/year
The Khris Middleton we thought went to Alcatraz has came back to haunt us
The Bucks were playing without Khris Middleton though
Tell Khris Middleton he's playing the Celtics

Khris Middleton is making 30 million a year and still decided to build his own brick house. So humble.
For your consideration: [Khris Middleton's Contract](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/milwaukee-bucks/khris-middleton-10864/)  Bucks got swindled.
Classic Khris Middleton shitting the bed
Middleton has been Kate instead of Khris tonight

KHRIS MIDDLETON IS NOT THAT GUY
Khris Middleton realized Celtics fans are rooting for bucks and said alright I‚Äôm gonna make sure to piss them off again even when I‚Äôm not facing them
THIS BUCKS OFFENSE IS TRIGGERING ME WITH THIS 2020 KHRIS MIDDLETON ISO BALL
Blake Griffin outshooting Khris Middleton I‚Äôm sick
Everyone to Khris Middleton right now:  https://streamable.com/br1y49
The fact Middleton (6‚Äô7‚Äù) got blocked by kyrie Irving (6‚Äô2‚Äù) tells you everything you need to know about Khris Middleton
Khris Middleton is damn near a liability rn
Somebody tell Khris Middleton the Celtics have been eliminated already
Another Khris Middleton no show
Jrue holiday and Khris Middleton are playing awful right now
"Giannis is also a top 5 player and Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton are both top 30 players imo, maybe one of them could even crack top 20. I'm rooting for the Nets cause I'm a Harden fan but it's gonna be reaalllyyyy tough for the Nets if Harden can't come back."
The Monstars get to Khris Middleton or what?
Khris Middleton is choking BIG TIME
"Khris Middleton for CJ, who says no"
Khris Middleton looks like he took a dip in a pool.  Insane amounts of sweat.
Their names are Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday
Lockdown defender khris middleton lol
"You're massively, massively sleeping on Khris Middleton. He averaged 20/6/5 shooting 41% from 3. They're good numbers!  I think the Bucks will win, just about, in 7 games. It will obviously be really close, I just feel the Bucks are more prepared defensively. Jrue/Giannis/Khris is such a solid defensive trio to throw at the Nets big 3, they won't lock them down but I think they can make them work.  I just think the Nets lack interior defence, and I think Giannis will end up switched onto Kyrie/Harden quite a lot. Plus,  I can see Brook Lopez could be a real issue for Blake playing the 5."
&gt; the Buck‚Äôs second best is Jrue. Their third is Kyrie and the Bucks‚Äô third is...the deer?  Have you ever heard of Khris Middleton before?
As a Celtics fan I have 100% respect for Khris Middleton. The guy turns into a god every time he plays us.

I love his [12 Days of Khrismas](https://www.cbs58.com/news/bucks-star-khris-middleton-distributes-coats-to-mps-students-as-part-of-12-days-of-khrismas-initiative)
How did Khris Middleton get them?
"If you are a Milwaukee  bucks fans, here is your stray for this thread:  GROW UP.  Your team is tall.  Khris Middleton is the most skilled player on your team, and a greek statue runs and dunks a lot for you.  You will lose in 5 in the next round."
"I'm taking the team with three legendarily efficient, nearly unstoppable scorers over the team that's like, ""If Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday can hit enough shots, maybe ..."""
"And one inch taller than [this Bucks lineup from 2019](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201903020UTA.html):  Khris Middleton (6'8"")  Giannis Antetokounmpo (6'11"")  Nikola Mirotic (6'10"")  Ersan Ilyasova (6'10"")  Brook Lopez (7'0"")  Remarkably no player is shorter than 6'8"". Adding their heights together gets to a total of 411 inches."
"Yeah! KD, Giannis, Harden and Khris Middleton."
Nobody's watching the finals for Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday.
"They don‚Äôt have a single top 10 player on their roster, lol. What stars? Khris Middleton or Zach Lavine level ‚Äústars‚Äù if anything."
Khris ‚ÄúIso hesi 360 no-scope step-back fade-away middy jimbo‚Äù Middleton
Where are Tony Snell and Khris Middleton?
"Khris Middleton apparently had one on, and I doubt he'd wear a fake. So someone is officially producing (and planning to sell) them. If the design had only been shared with Nike..."
"How many of these sneakers were made and sold? It's weird because I did notice Khris Middleton had them on at some point during the Bucks-Heat series, so I thought I had missed the news because I'm not into sneakers.  Like you said, it all comes down to a cost/benefit calculation of the damages you can recover vs. legal costs. Some things are not worth suing over unless you're in it for a moral victory or want to use the lawsuit to highlight something publicly."
Khris Middleton wore them in Game 4.
Plenty of people in this thread have shown that Khris Middleton has worn them on the court and that there are a bunch of people in the UK who got their hands on them.
"Any secondary shot creator/shooter will be a great fit next to Luka who is one of the best offensive engines in the league right now next to Harden, Steph, Giannis and Jokic. Someone like Khris Middleton would be a perfect fit IMO although any SG/SF who can get 20ppg on decent efficiency and space the floor will do. They can help run the bench units so Luka can rest without the offence falling apart and space the floor when sharing the floor with the starters. They should also look at targeting a Capela type centre who can catch and finish lobs next to an all-time passer in Luka and protect the rim on defence."
Khris middleton
"I feel we need a go to bucket getter, not that middleton is bad cuz I love khris, but Beal is insane"
Khris' middleton and donte divincenzo for Bradley beal
Source/link on Khris Middleton having a pair?
"Here on her [ig](https://www.instagram.com/p/CPpiiCjDQRJ/?utm_medium=copy_link) she says she doesn‚Äôt even have a pair, while people somehow got their hands on them lol  Khris Middleton was seen wearing them before too. https://www.instagram.com/p/CPfRsyODI9T/?utm_medium=copy_link"
A khris middleton type would be idea. Someone who can create their own shots reliably and also space the floor well so they can share the floor with Luka.
"Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton lost this game, legit feel bad for Giannis"
Yikes at the people blaming Giannis for this. Dude has been a one man band.  Khris Middleton is great at home and meh on the road. But Jrue Holiday is the absolute bum of the team.
"jrue holiday and khris middleton are dog shit, KD and giannis are just those guys. this and one is sealing it I can already tell"
What the fuck Khris Middleton. What the fuck was that
Khris Middleton is a clown
Marv loves himself some Khris Middleton
jrue holiday and khris middleton piss me off and i couldn‚Äôt give a fuck about the outcome of this game but KD‚Ä¶hey cutie
"FOUL, KHRIS MIDDLETON, BAD BREATH"
Khris Middleton needs to stick to doing Khris Middleston shit. Wait for your looks and stick them.
Khris Middleton is the homeless man's version of KD
Khris Middleton is not an iso ball into off balance fadeaway player and should really stop trying to be
Shout out to Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday for carrying the Nets
Shaq had Kobe and D Wade. Giannis has Khris Middleton as his 2nd best player
Khris Middleton and Jrue choking
Khris Middleton 8 pts  Jrue Holiday with 4 pts  Not great
khris middleton playing this trash and the game this close it's over for the nets
Khris Middleton is a fucking beta male
Is Khris Middleton wearing a mouth piece or his jaw built like that
"Giannis might not have a polished offensive game, but at least he's going for it. Where the hell is 'Top 20 player' Khris Middleton and 'Playoff Stud' Jrue Holiday?  the only other player with no fear is 44 year old PJ Tucker."
Giannis has 1 made three.  Khris Middleton has zero 3's  Jrue Holliday has zero 3's.  Giannis deserves no fucking blame for this shit.
"Holy. Fucking. Shit.   Jrue and Middleton has combined for 4-22 today.  Four. For. Fucking. Twenty. Two.  It is an absolute miracle that we're not getting blown out right. I can't say that I have high hopes that the either one of these players will do better in the 2nd half. Khris has always been a hot or cold player, and Jrue has been shit the whole series."
A more interesting question: where are the Bucks if they actually got Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday.
Bruce Brown has more points than Jrue Holliday and Khris Middleton combined. That's fucking embarrassing.
How is washed Blake Griffin playing better than Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday
Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday is throwing.  Not showing up at all.
WTB Game 6 Khris Middleton can offer 7 foot Greek in exchange
They aren‚Äôt getting Khris Middleton lol
bro khris middleton is so ugly
khris middleton so ugly lmao
Bro Khris Middleton needs to pull giannis to the side and say every three pointer u shoot that‚Äôs how many times I‚Äôm gonna punch u in face if we lose this game stop fucking shooting 3s
Will superstar Khris Middleton show up again tonight?
"Kinda an impossible list... I'll do some tiers.  Tier A: Draymond, Jrue Holiday, Anthony Davis, Giannis, Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid.  \-These are the absolutely elite guys, the guys who don't get played off no matter what happens and might be so good at D they change what the other teams offense does.  Tier B: Rudy Gobert, Paul George, Playoff Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Khris Middleton, Bam Adebayo, Pascal Siakam, Kawhi Leonard, OG Anunoby, Klay Thompson, JJJ, Deandre Ayton, Dejounte Murray, Jonathan Isaac.  \-Really great players who aren't quite as game warping as the top group. On their best day, they affect the game much more than most, but is every game their best game? I would say sorta yes, sorta no. This is the ""clearly above average"" group.  Tier C: Lu Dort, Aaron Gordon, Matisse Thybulle, Royce O Neal, Mikal Bridges, Deandre Hunter, Jonas Valanciunas, Patrick Beverly, Alex Caruso, KCP, Derrick White  \-They not getting paid for offense and they will never expect paychecks for that. They are all above average players on D, and at times can be Tier A guys, but much of the time they aren't and there's no shame to that.  I'm 100% sure I'm missing guys. My biggest issue is where to put Jonathan Isaac."
Khris Middleton has entered the chat  &amp;#x200B;  *please*
The absolute disrespect to Khris Middleton
"I mean are comfortable with him as the second option? If the litmus test is say... Khris Middleton, can you get a game in the series where Conley can go off a win you a game or two?"
Greatest game 6 performance since Khris middleton yesterday
yeah if wants to go to ecf cause harris been mia all series  and harden is playing on a hurt hamstring. nets bench is trash so where are you going to get points from?  xfactor for game  is the play of khris middleton. he goes off alongside giannis the series is over for the nets
"You had multiple opportunities to get out of that hole, Kennard over Donovan Mitchell, Stanley Johnson over Booker, trading Khris Middleton and Dinwiddie, etc, if we draft well we‚Äôll be fine and looking at how we‚Äôve out drafted multiple lottery teams with the 29th pick I think I have hope."
"Well yeah I mean being good enough to be in the NBA means he has above average basketball skills in general, but my point was more so compared to other high level MVP candidates he has an absurdly low level offensive skill set,  I think he‚Äôs a great player and he‚Äôs clearly put in work because he wasn‚Äôt an MVP level player coming out of the draft and I‚Äôm not sure many people expected him to become one, but the point still stands that guys in his tier almost across the board have more basketball skill than him (we‚Äôre talking top 10 players in the entire world so it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm saying he sucks) and I think the Chris Paul comparison is relevant to my point of athleticism having a significant role in overcoming lack of skill and vis versa, I‚Äôm not saying the guys is a shitty basketball player lmao I‚Äôm saying he doesn‚Äôt deserve to be the MVP of the league and to my first point I think Khris Middleton is a bigger asset in the playoffs until Giannis increases his skill level"
It's more difficult when you have guys like Eric Bledsoe and Khris Middleton next to you than when you have a guy like LeBron next to you.
"I‚Äôm praying the bucks win simply because I don‚Äôt think we can beat the nets with 2/3 of the big 3(if we beat the sixers of course). I know Milwaukee is fairly healthy but coach bud has shown he has no idea what he‚Äôs doing in this post season, and even though we have literally no one who can guard Khris Middleton(barring a reddish return), we‚Äôve played the bucks very well this season and I think we‚Äôd have a decent shot at beating them."
Middleton is the 3rd best performer in the playoffs? Are yoy high or just Khris Middleton?
"It is indeed, as already mentioned, both of them share an alma mater, the texas longhorns. As a side note, Khris Middleton attended their rival university, Texas A&amp;M University, less than 2 hours away."
"well like i said he‚Äôs playing confident which is what we need at the end of the day. and you act like joe shooting bad is the only bad thing he‚Äôs doing on the court. you remember that three point foul on khris middleton that killed our momentum in the fourth quarter last game? yea that was by the legend himself, joe fucking harris."

"[Nah he's done alright, never been that bad this year](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/gamelog/_/id/6609/khris-middleton). I mean he might've had bad games I just haven't seen them. Mostly I've seen him go tons of halves 2-of-9 or 3-of-11 and then finish around 35-40% from the field."
"imagine if those holiday missed threes were a middleton shot, khris would've had 60 points"
... the bucks shot 21% from 3 and not Khris Middleton bucks were 2/25 from deep?
I want the Bucks to win because I love Khris Middleton and I dont like Harden I expect the Nets to win with a big triple double by Harden while Khris goes 2/15
giannis got carried by khris middleton üòêüòêüòê
The Khris Middleton game. When he is locked in he's so fun to watch. Gets to his spots and there is nothing you can do to stop it.
I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs equal if not better. Khris Middleton might be the best athlete in the history of sports if you discount stats and everything else that measures that stuff

"PG's worst games are ghastly, he just loses confidence. Khris keeps shooting even on bad nights and usually the numbers correct themselves a bit by the end. I don't ever remember seeing Middleton go 4-17."
I'd still take Khris Middleton pullups over PG's but then I'm probably speaking from PTSD
If you think the same people who were in here upvoting comments saying KD is the best player in the world two days ago are the same people who are in this thread upvoting comments saying Khris Middleton has outplayed KD in 3 games then I have a bridge to sell you.
"Wade was at best a run of the mill all star by 2014, similar to current Khris Middleton at best."
"Khris Middleton facing elimination in Game 5 2020: 23/7/6/6 Turnovers, 8-25 FG. Better, let's hope he keeps today's performance up for game 7"
"Khris ""Master Baiter"" Middleton"
Max contracts are staying as long as Tobias Harris and Khris Middleton are getting max contracts. They essentially steal from the team star and distribute that pay to lesser players.
"Khris ""Michael Jordan"" Middleton  People see the scoring, but look at the dude's full line, what the fuck?  38/10/5/5 (those 5 juicy steals) on 11-16 shooting  I mean. The fuck? If that was another player we'd be hyping it up as some all time playoff game, that line on 16fgs?  Also he was 5/8 from 3pt and the Bucks were 7/33, so the rest of the team was 2/25 LMAO (even with Giannis not taking any!)"
"Yeah, this FT scene pissed people off way more than Harden throwing a hissy fit that Joe Harris didn't foul Khris Middleton, encouraging his coach to challenge a super obvious foul, ESPN cutting to a full commercial break, then coming back and being like ""oops there was no challenge cuz Joe Harris admitted he fouled and we're gonna play it off like it was a mistake""  The anti-Bucks circlejerk is so dumb when it comes to the Giannis FT stuff because there is so much stupider stuff people who actually like basketball should be complaining about, like all the flopping and foul baiting"
I saw someone say if Khris Middleton wasn't ugly then people would actually talk about him outside of Milwaukee and I can't help but agree
Amazing performance from Khris Middleton
Khris Middleton: hold my beer
Imagine if you get Khris Middleton Wiggin's body you probslby have the goat.
GOAT List  1. Khris Middleton vs Celtics 2. Andrew Wiggins vs OKC 3. Michael Jordan
Or if Khris Middleton wins a game winner over all the stars in this series and is the best player in 3 out of 7 games
Never thought I‚Äôd see the day when Khris Middleton and Patrick Ewing would be in the same company.
"I‚Äôm a Khris Middleton fan now, who would‚Äôve thought?"
Khris Middleton is a brilliant basketball player and I will fight anyone who says otherwise.
I like Khris Middleton
"Giannis Antetokounmpo invited his old friend Khris Middleton for a basketball game at Fiserv Forum. That night in Milwaukee, Giannas didn‚Äôt shoot a 3 for the first time. ‚ÄúI could fuck with this,‚Äù he said. A super-team was starting to be formed, over a side of Middleton pulling up from 3 and‚Ä¶ one."
"Only 5 people have ever (in recorded history) put up at least 35 pts, 10 rebs, 5 asts, and 5 stls in a playoff game-  Michael Jordan  Patrick Ewing  Gary Payton  Jimmy Butler  Khris Middleton"
Khris Middleton was the best player in a game with Harden/Giannis/KD
Shout out to Pistons legend Khris Middleton

khris middleton is really a different person at fiserv
"Similarly, Khris Middleton was in this tier long enough that everyone realized he was overrated and now he‚Äôs back to being underrated"
Khris Middleton is our offensive MVP of the game so far
Its quite sad to see an MVP like Giannis get always carried in the 4th by Khris Middleton.  &amp;#x200B;  Dont ever compare Giannis to Kawhi or KD again please
Respect to Khris Middleton for not joining in on his teammates choking again. He seems to actually want to win.
lmao the irony of Harden complaining about Khris Middleton hooking a defenders arm
When Khris Middleton feels like he‚Äôs the best on the court the Bucks are very hard to stop
I fucking love Khris Middleton

Khris Middleton should not be guarding KD. Why they insist on this? Is Bud really gonna die on that hill?
Khris Middleton looks like a deer
"[Andrews] Mike Budenholzer says that after playing light minutes in Game 5, neither Giannis Antetokounmpo nor Khris Middleton will have any sort of heavy minutes tonight for Game 6."
It's crunch time that hurts the Bucks. Giannis isn't a great crunch time player and lets Khris Middleton take the wheel
"I‚Äôll take the two time MVP, Jrue Holiday, and 2 time all star Khris Middleton over Tatum and Brown. You‚Äôre delusional if you think anyone would take the Celtics job if the bucks become open."
Leave Khris Middleton out of this
"Lets assume they fail this year.  Then they don't do it next year...Jrue Holiday aint getting any younger. Neither is Khris Middleton.  Giannis will be 28 and at a crossroads, and his next two best players will be 31 and 33 and probably fading fast."
lol you act like Harden faced the same GSW team every year.   Harden has had some pretty good teams and again has yet to succeed. Giannis had what Khris Middleton (who disappears) and Eric Bledsoe? Yeah he‚Äôs had some great teams and definitely in a spot to dominate especially with Bud as their head coach.
Khris Middleton in shambles...
"Personally I think his floor is Khris Middleton. Slower lateral movement on defense and off ball movement on offense, still an amazing shooter. I don't think his contract will be that bad."
Khris Middleton looks like a gnome
Khris Middleton is ugly af
"Khris Middleton, Tyler Johnson   I can call them ugly when they make millions of dollars a year they're still winning both the battle and the war"
"Proud Bucks fan repping two of the ugliest players in NBA history, Sam Cassell and Khris Middleton"
Khris Middleton  He was even ugly on the court for the first 2 games of the series. Bucks dropping both of those easily winnable ones is what led tho where we are today
Khris middleton
Khris middleton easily
"As they should man. LeBron drug far more inferior players to the Finals at 22 man, no way he‚Äôs not making the Finals with Malcolm Brogdon, Eric Bledsoe, Jrue Bledsoe &amp; Khris Middleton next to him. Look at what Trae Young is doing rn, Giannis has no excuses &amp; when he loses this series he should get demoted to as the 15th best player in the league."
"Problem i think is Giannis is the teams supermax player, he is the teams superstar. Superstars are what win rings in the NBA. The things that they do to bring their team to victory, carrying the offence, making key decisions, showing up in the clutch are things Giannis is poorly equipped to deal with.  I think that at the end of the day offensive success in the playoffs is more important then defence.   The lakers won last year on defence but they also had an all time playmaker/passer in Lebron. I think with Jokic you can surround him  with players to help more on defence, i.e you dont need a playmaking pointguard on the floor and can look for a defense first one or looking for a more defence first 4. With Giannis he needs someone to close out the fourth for him or  to control the half court offence and the level of that player needs to be significantly higher for teams to win in playoff time then some defence minded role players Jokic would need to aid him. its harder to find guys better then Khris Middleton then it is to find good defensive role players."
I don‚Äôt think Trae is considered ugly? I‚Äôm pretty sure they just make jokes about his hair. Khris Middleton‚Ä¶ see that‚Äôs an ugly mf
"no he isnt. He dropped 48 on the nets in the regular season. He averaged like 40 vs the nets in the reg season lmao. He is underperforming once again. You cant say him averaging the same as his normal points is doing well when hes playing against maybe the weakest interior defence team in the playoffs/league.  Look at his numbers vs miama and toronto last couple years, below average. Khris middleton was the reason they won the games he did, he dropped 35 and was clutch."
"that undersized player you like really could be your team's PJ Tucker.  those alt uniforms your team got this year are terrible.  Marv Albert sure is old and confused!  Nothing that happens before the playoffs matters at all ever!  teams that lose in the playoffs are humiliating and they probably should fire everybody!  referees should be fined for making bad calls. Their families should also probably be punished!  This draft class is definitely going to be the best in sooo long!  NBA players are vaccine-skeptical and if you think that's dumb listen I want to explain some history stuff to you...  Australians and Kiwis are such a delight.  Khris Middleton is just so underrated.  Kevin Love, John Wall, and Demarcus Cousins are all completely done and will never play good basketball ever again!"
KHRIS Middleton is a god. Devin Booker biggest pussy in the league

So we running a Khris Middleton offense? Shoot me.
"I‚Äôd go with AD, Tatum, PG, Butler, and Kawhi even if Kawhi can‚Äôt defend at the same level as before in no particular order.  Klay needs to come back before I add him.  KD is just below those guys.  Jaylen is not there yet defensively (he‚Äôs great at 1 on 1 defense though).  I‚Äôd put Pascal Siakam, Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, Jaren Jackson Jr (assuming he comes back to what he was in the 2019-2020 season), and Dejounte Murray over Tobias."
is khris middleton kate middleton's husband? are they related?
Go beyond pick 15. Draymond and Khris Middleton were 2nd round picks and that was 2012 alone.

"I got a feeling a khris middleton game is brewing, if I know anything about the playoff bucks its that in every series there's at least 1 game where middleton turns into Kevin durant"
Khris Middleton tho
"you are calling Khris Middleton Kate, aren't ya? As a form of disrespect? Or am I misunderstanding something massive lol?"
"Not always -  there have always been a couple role players on the rosters. Kirk Hinrich, Shane Battier, Tyson Chandler, Kenneth Faried and Mason Plumlee have all played big roles over the years.    But in any case, I don't agree that this year's roster lacks role players. Draymond and Bam are definitely role players - they're just really, really good role players. Jerami Grant has become a scorer, but he was viewed as a 3-and-D wing only 1 year ago. Kevin Love, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday have spent plenty of time in complementary roles in their day."
"Darius Garland will be among three guys promoted to Team USA for the team‚Äôs exhibition games, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic.

"idk it's pretty common for players to develop later. he's the current exception but there's one on every team. Pat Bev, Kyle Lowry, PJ Tucker, Khris Middleton, Marcus was considered worse than Markieff for a good while, Seth Curry, Spencer Dinwiddie, most teams have a guy who developed late and became a productive member of a playoff team. There's lots of routes in the nba and late bloomers for sure exist."
I've never noticed him sweating that much but I have noticed that Khris Middleton looks like he has hyperhidrosis by the end of a game.
Yeah the reason Giannis is going to the line is because Monty Williams' Hack-a-tekoumpo strategy. I wonder why Khris Middleton isn't going to the line over and over. It's almost as if the Suns foul Giannis on purpose knowing he's a spotty FT shooter ...
"Here's what he said in response to a specific question regarding FT differential. That's about the harshest I've ever seen him go after officiating, calling it ""frustrating"".  &gt;On Wednesday, Bucks head coach Mike Budenholzer was asked about the free-throw attempt difference, and he provided this response, per ESPN's [Tim Bontemps]  &gt;""You trying to bait me?"" Budenholzer said as he smiled.   &gt;""No, I mean, it's a huge part of the game. They had 25 points from the free throw line. We're a team that prides ourselves in defending and being able to be good defensively without fouling.  &gt;""I can't remember the last time a team got 25 free throws in a game against the Bucks. And then conversely, the way Giannis [Antetokounmpo] attacks, the way Khris [Middleton] attacks, as many opportunities as Khris has with the ball...it's frustrating, but it's part of the sport. It's part of the game.  &gt;""We've got to be better defensively. We've got to keep them off the free throw line and we got to be more aggressive attacking and getting to the free throw line and getting to good offense."""
Khris Middleton facial expressions make him stay looking like he owes someone $20.
"Giannis: By the end of the series, Khris Middleton and I might as well be twins."
And that‚Äôs why Khris Middleton will get used to FIBA in a second
"The funnier part to me is that Khris Middleton and Devin booker have had near-identical stats for the last 2 series, but no one is (rightfully) calling Khris Middleton a Superstar or the next Kobe.  Just goes to show the media narrative at play."
Yea that game was amazing. Such a shame his team always lets him down. CJ McCollum reminds me of Khris Middleton minus the defense. Way too inconsistent.
"Khris Middleton had a defensive rating of 112.8 in 2020-21. This playoffs it‚Äôs 107.3. Jrue was 111.2 and 108.3 for these playoffs. Obviously these aren‚Äôt the end all be all but I think you‚Äôre underselling him. As someone who watched him because he‚Äôs on my sim team, I love him on defense."
Michael redd or khris Middleton? Who is better lol
They‚Äôre still waiting on Khris ‚ÄúBatman‚Äù Middleton
Mostly iso guys and we're about to add Devin Booker and Khris Middleton lmao. Jesus help us.
Lol seems like usa needs the nba finalist jrue and khris middleton
"We are missing Devin Booker, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday who are currently playing in the NBA finals. Which is dumb why would NBA played its Finals weeks before Olympics."
"I mean, that Lakers team was dogshit without AD tho. You give Bron a Khris Middleton and Holiday to work with and I guarantee he would've played better. Not a great comparison."
I guess those Khris Middleton for LeBron James trades got to him.
Thanks for Khris Middleton in that trade *-Bucks Fan*
"Well, the question is if Booker is elite. If you're scoring 17 ppg, that's not elite. 17 ppg is too easy (relatively speaking, of course). For instance, Khris Middleton has scored 17+ points in 15/20 games. I think 25 ppg is fair if you want to be considered elite. I'm not saying you have to score 25+ every game, but at least 75% of your games is enough to consider you elite."
Just give us Khris ‚ÄúMichael Jordan‚Äù Middleton ü•µü•µ
Khris needs to learn the soccer flop from Paul and Booker.  In reality the difference Middleton stop trying to shot the fade away all the time.  While Paul and Booker have been moving forward into the defensive player.  What needs to change is not the refs but a rules change calling fouls if the shooter purposely is jumping into the defender on a jump shot.
"If the Bucks win without Giannis, then it should go to the Batman aka Khris Middleton! Carry on..."
Putting Kyrie over Dame is like putting Khris Middleton over Kawhi
Kevin Durant - Khris Middleton
"Well, here is Giannis ""Checks Under His Bed at Night for Jimmy Butler"" Flop-etokounmpo playoff record for everyone to see that he has never even won a legitimate playoff series before this year either:  Beginning of time to 1994: too scared of Jimmy Butler to be born  1994-2013: too scared of Jimmy Butler to come to the NBA  2014: so bad he didnt even play that much and he still cost his team 23 more games than the previous season  2015: peed his pants at the sight of Jimmy Butler's Bulls, lost in 6  2016: so scarred by his encounter with Jimmy Butler he refuses to make the playoffs  2017: Wins Most Improved Player and plays on a superteam with Rookie of the Year (better player than Joel Embiid for context) Malcolm Brogdon and Pistons legend Khris Middleton, still loses to a lowly Raptors team in 6 that got destroyed by Lebron.   2018: Lets his superteam down again to the Baby Celtics missing Hayward and Kyrie in 7 games  2019: After winning MVP because voters felt bad for him despite being on a superteam, barely squeaked by Pistons with an injured Blake Griffin (doesnt count, poor sportsmanship not to wait until Blake got better, but Giannis was scared again), beat the Baby Celtics (doesnt count because I said so), then lost in 6 to some random Canadian team led by some mute guy who hadn't played in two years. Used Brogdon as a scapegoat and Giannis cried until they let Brogdon walk (my uncle works for the Bucks, I know all the inside info and know all the players and wear all the flyest clothes and call the players by their nicknames, it's not a big deal though)  2020: Barely squeaked by Orlando without any of their good players (Doesnt count because Shaq, Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, Tmac, and Dwight Howard all didnt play). Lost to the Miami Jimmy Butlers in 5 after being so scared that Giannis refused to finish the series."
The whole point of the joke is irony from pundits and hot take artists who hyped up Khris Middleton during the Hawks series and made the bold claims the he should be the first option on the bucks and Giannis would be his number 2 (robin)

Middleton had a better game 1. 29 points on 12-26(46fg%) shooting and 5-12 from 3(42%)  Booker was 8-21(38%) and 1-8 from 3.   Khris had a dog shit game 2 but i don't get why people pretend he was shit in game 1 as well.
"Lmao this is just moronic. Nothing about game 1, huh? The Bucks should have gotten even more free throws in game 2. Khris Middleton has to get absolutely murdered to even get a shooting foul call. It took him until last night to finally get a whistle   Giannis gets fouled on basically every play. Anyone with a inch of basketball mind knows that.  Keep playing 2k and thinking you know hoops Junior"
Just spam Middleton-Giannis PnR and Middleton iso in baseline.  If Khris is hot no one can guard him in that mid baseline post
"&gt; If 75% of your points are scored by only three guys, you're not deep enough.  Tbf the KD Warriors didn't really have major issues with the scoring mainly coming from three guys. Same with the Brooklyn Nets who would likely be in the Finals and probably winning a championship if they'd been healthy this Playoffs. Depth off the bench is needed for the playoffs, but it's not like teams haven't had success with 3 guys running the offense. (Obviously the Bucks aren't as good offensively as those teams, but their big 3 hasn't played up to their potential. They're also missing a starter as well. )  Also, the Suns core had a ""live scrimmage"" cause they got blown off the court. Booker didn't have a good game, but it's not like Middleton was amazing either. If Middleton shot better which we've seen him do, then it's possible the Bucks win anyway. This is literally the first game of the series where Jrue and Khris played well."
"Once again, your argument is extremely subjective and it only shows your homerism and ignorance.  First off, you talk about foul baiting as being part of the game. And then you differentiate what Booker does to what Harden does. Ok? How does that make sense? Harden defined foul baiting in this generation of basketball and Booker has been doing that same shit all playoff. He is constantly inititing contact and bumps into the defenders chest to create seperation. If that's legal and if Booker deserves a call every time, why doesn't a big man like Giannis  who is getting contact EVERY time in the paint. Which brings me to my next point:  And you want to compare foul calls to a fucking big man (center) to that of a shoot guard? Come on, if you've been watching this game for as long you claim you'll know fouling a big man has been going on for eras now. Just because Giannis is a superstar, doesn't mean his foul calls aren't legit. The fact that you think otherwise shows your ignorance.   And you even mentioned it yourself. It is strategic. To purposely foul Giannis to deter easy buckets. OK. So whats the problem? 1/3 of the foul calls are legit? What about the other 2/3? When he's being held down? or when he goes up? You don't think they're fucking making contact? You're going to say that's part of the game? You're going to say ""oh, he's a big man! of course they'll make contact, all part of the game"". You also make this argument knowing that the strategy is to send a terrible Free throw shooter to the line. So doesn't all this foul call actually play into the hands of Suns? Yet you bitch about it because you have no idea what you're talking about.    Lets say you are right. Lets say Booker deserves all his foul calls.  How about Khris Middleton then? How many foul calls did get doing similiar shit to what Booker has done albeit not as obvious?  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ogb3m3/highlight_middleton_tries_to_lean_into_the/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share How many calls Did Middleton get in his the first 3 games of the playoffs? I'll wait.  Then you want to bring in a disgraced Tim Donaghy ref who went to fucking jail for fixing a game to argue against the ""questionable calls"" to extend a playoff series. Sure, you can live on that conspiracy but that's fucking hilarious that you'd turn to the biggest disgraced ref in NBA history to make an argument."
Khris Middleton will never get the respect he deserves because he's ugly
"If I‚Äôm considering possible movements, regression, and injuries I have East Guards | Zach LaVine, Trae Young, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Lonzo Ball, Bradley Beal, Collin Sexton East Forwards | Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid, Kevin Durant, Jayson Tatum, Bam Adebayo East Replacements/Snubs | LaMelo Ball, Cade Cunningham, Domantas Sabonis, Jimmy Butler, Khris Middleton, Jaylen Brown, Caris LeVert, Julius Randle West Guards | Stephen Curry, Donovan Mitchell, Ja Morant, Damian Lillard, De‚ÄôAaron Fox, Devin Booker West Forwards | Nikola Jokic, LeBron James, Ben Simmons, Zion Williamson, Karl-Anthony Towns, Paul George West Replacements/Snubs | Chris Paul, D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Michael Porter Jr,  Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Brandon Ingram, Rudy Gobert  Hopefully I‚Äôm not forgetting anyone"
Defensively they'd get a lot worse. Let's say we replace Giannis with your average PF and there's no way to stop the Trae young pnr. That frontcourt isn't quick enough and is gonna gett exposed by the elite pnr guards.  It's also not like Jrue and Middleton were getting bad shots either. Lots of bunnies at the rim for Jrue and mid range jumpers for Khris and Harden isn't changing that

Jrue Bledsoe and Khris Middleton going back to his non-Celtics form gonna tank this series for Giannis.
Khris playing like Kate Middleton
Khris Middleton getting hacked all game
I‚Äôm bored so let me ask you guys: is Khris Middleton elite?
Yep. Except if you're Khris Middleton then fuck you I guess
Can we get a Khris Middleton fuck you 3rd quarter please?
Khris and Middleton?  Also it's half time of game 1 lol suns in 5 seems extreme based on what we've seen.
What about Khris Middleton driving and getting absolutely murdered and then booker coming down and flailing before he was touched ?
Bucks fans complaining about flopping when Khris Middleton has a few Oscars in his closet is comical
"Do you think Khris Middleton and Sam Cassell came to Earth from the same planet?  They should do a special Vernon Maxwell edition of this, all read by Utah Jazz players. Then the last one could be Matt Damon looking at the phone and saying, ""Man, Mad Max hates Utah even more than I hate you, Jimmy."""
"Alright, that's it for me. I'm not gonna spend all night watching Khris Middleton get battered on one end without a whistle while Devin Booker graduates from the Trae Young School of Baiting Phantom Calls."
So Khris Middleton gets absolutely mauled in the paint but D Book flops and gets that lol
LOL Khris Middleton is not better than Giannis.
The Reason Khris Middleton.
Look for Khris Middleton to impose his prodigious scoring ability.
"&gt; Devin Booker or Khris Middleton, which No. 2 steps up  Um, Booker isn't No. 2 on that team.  I think both teams will hoist a tonne of 3s so whoever makes the most will win. Both will play great defense, I suspect. Both will rebound like hell.  I wish it came down to something more, and maybe a role guy will step up and add some big impact, but I really think it's a 3pt shooter's game right now."
Tony Allen was a 3x first team all defense and is widely regarded as the best perimeter defender of his generation. It‚Äôs weird nobody gave him a max contract.  Khris Middleton has never averaged more than 20 a game. Terry Rozier averaged 20 this past season
"""Thanks for that great sideline reporting, while we were gone Khris Middleton scored 15 points in one minute and thirty-five seconds, now a commercial break"""
lol üòÇ  2 time all star Khris Middleton and 2 time all nba first team defense Jrue Holiday as ‚Äúrole players‚Äù is ??? analysis
"I am super satisfied with the Finals this year, I like both teams quite a lot.  Antics aside, I am rooting for CP3 to finally get one, and Jae Crowder is my guy as a former Celtic.  And it's hard not to like Giannis &amp; Jrue, and even though he's literal nightmare fuel for the Celtics it's pretty awesome that Khris Middleton has taken himself from the G-League to the NBA Finals."
Reddit is. The casual fan won‚Äôt really care that much. I think this season is intriguing because it brings up a lot of narratives for the next season.   But like in all fairness if you‚Äôre talking to me in a vacuum I‚Äôm not really too interested in Khris Middleton vs Chris Paul
"I don't think so. Bucks still have the best player on the court, even without Giannis. Khris Middleton is simply on fire right now."
Should have snuck in Khris Middleton on your team for a quality shitpost
Khris Middleton with point guard skills would make the hall of fame
"&gt; Not blindly sticking to the drop scheme, but incorporating way more switching, particularly in small-small actions. This absolutely destroyed the Bucks in last year's series against Miami, when they would mindlessly drop on even small-small actions and get burned repeatedly with the screener getting good looks &gt;   The reason Bucks stick to drop scheme is because it's been working for them, consistently being top defensive team every year under Bud  And it's due to personel, Brook Lopez is terrible at switching, Giannis is terrible at navigating screens and is way better on help defense  Also drop coverage has been better for them vs the Hawks than actually switching, i've pointed out this before the Hawks in the first 4 games actually scored less points per game with Trae Young healthy than in the last 2 when Bucks adopted the switching scheme   Hawks first four games, 104ppg Bucks playing drop coverage  Hawks last 2 games, crippled Trae Young as well, 109ppg with Bucks switching &gt;Not going under screens guarding Jimmy Butler (a poor off the dribble shooter) until they were on the verge of getting swept, and not letting Giannis guard him. They did both of those things in the rematch, putting size on him with Giannis/Tucker and going under on screens daring him to beat them with the jumper, and absolutely clamped Jimmy for the series.   Again, this goes to the same thing, it's personel and Giannis is not good at guarding other guards because he can't navigate screens, he's said that himself because of his size   &gt;Play your fucking core guys more minutes. Bud did absolutely mind-blowingly stupid things like playing Khris Middleton 33 minutes in a PLAYOFF game that he was +18 in but the Bucks lost by just 2 points.    https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/202009020MIL.html  You mean the game Middleton was in foul trouble? He had 3 fouls in the 2nd quarter, so again no point at all   &gt;They idiotically didn't run anywhere near enough PnR actions with Giannis as the roll man. Not from the top, not side PnRs, etc. You have one of the most devastating slashing forward who can murder teams as the roll man, and they did little to exploit this. They're running much more of Giannis as the roll man this year.   Giannis was used as a roll man in 2.3 possessions last season, he's being used as a rolle man 2.4 possessions this season, again you're completely wrong and basically no adjustment was made, you're just spewing bs  https://go.nba.com/hfdj  https://go.nba.com/qed8"
"thanks for actually answering the question lol. I tried my best to phrase this properly   i feel like this was the season for Khris and Jrue to shake of the inconsistency narritive but i think it sticks regardless or winning. they'd have to put up solid numbers every game to move the needle in current narritive and perceived ranking.   Hot Middleton seems like a solid #2 right up there with Kyrie and AD, its just a shame he's so hot and cold"
I also think he‚Äôll be the best player in the draft. Cade looks more like Khris Middleton with rly good vision.
"On somewhat of a similar note, All-Stars have turned out to be a pretty lazy way of assessing people like 10+ years after the fact. First it‚Äôs a half-season award. Second it‚Äôs so binary in such a way that makes it sound like there is a huge difference between an All-Star and non-All Star, where in reality there isn‚Äôt.   For example just look at this year with Ben Simmons. If the All-Star voting was done now, I guarantee Khris Middleton, Trae Young, and possibly even Jrue Holiday would receive more votes and be All-Stars over him. Yet when you look back on it 5-10 years from now, it makes it seem like Simmons had the ‚Äúbetter year‚Äù if you just blindly use All-Star appearances."
Khris Middleton wins finals mvp I bet there‚Äôs gonna be a Giant shit on the Pistons thread on here
"What sounds better: giannis and khris middleton or kyrie, harden, and kd. Giannis is arguably not even in the top 2 of that group."
"In the 2019 FIBA World Cup the US had a roster that had Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker, Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner and other NBA players coached by Gregg Popovich.  They didn't even make it to the Bronze game. They absolutely would not medal in the Olympics with those players."
"This is a good level headed take. But having the right coach for the right team is extremely important. For example. Jason Kidd is a helluva devolpmental coach. He turned Giannis and Khris Middleton into superstars. Us Bucks fans hold a certain amount of resentment toward Kidd, but the narrative should change because as unethical and aggressive as Kidd's coaching style was it obviously worked.   But for some reason with nearly identical roster the bucks went from a .500 team into the no. 1 seed in the east.  Another good example is Doug Collins. Incredible coach. He was MJs guy. Doug probably could have taken the Bulls to the next step but he had at least 1 or 2 pretty decent chances.  The counter argument will always be well it was the teams they played thats why they couldn't advance. But that is true for every single basketball game, or really any sports match.  My final point is about Erik Spolestra and Steve Kerr. Two people handed Incredible rosters and achieved exactly what was expected of them. Here's the thing. Both have also coached on an extremely high level without great rosters. Those guys aren't going anywhere. Kerr had the best luck ever and now the worst luck ever. Kay Thompson missing two full seasons is a fucking crime against basketball. That dude is no fucking joke. I pray he can be the guy we know because if that's the case every team in the west should be scared. Curry is a top 5 player in basketball and Thompson is better than many players that have made the ASG in his absence."
No one is better than Khris Middleton stop lying
No one with a working brain stem believes this.   I‚Äôm not sure I can quantify a way in which Khris Middleton is better than Kobe. Obviously not offensively. Absolutely not defensively.
I agree Lebron and Michael are bums and chokers. They should get a few pointers from the goat Khris Middleton
Are you kidding me? I watched a documentary about Kobe and he said Khris and Jokic was his childhood hero. He always wanted to be good and clutch as Middleton. And Kobe won few rings thanks to Middleton's mentorship.
"&gt;Is Khris Middleton a better player than Kobe Bryant?  FTFY  And yes, he is."
"Did Middleton ever have 55 in a half?   Kobe is one of the most clutch player ever.    If your trying to compare his clutch to someone try comparing him to MJ or Dame, not fucking Khris James Middleton"
Whatever team the GOAT Khris Middleton is on
Khris Middleton
Devin Vassell looks like he‚Äôs going to be the next Khris Middleton of the league. I‚Äôm biased obviously but his game is so nice and smooth on offense and his defensive IQ is off the charts as well. I definitely think he‚Äôs taking a big step this year
Giannis is probably the best player on the court but to me the most imporant player will be Khris Middleton. I feel like the bucks really only take over if he's poppin off.
1. PG  2. Khris Middleton  3. Rashard Lewis w/ worse defense  4. Jerami Grant  5. Bam  6. Derozan  7. Baby Harden
I agree a Little Jrue and Middleton were incredible against the hawks but damn were they inconsistent against the nets I think Khris only had 3 or 2 good games against the nets and jrue was terrible. Probs to them for stepping up in the ECF though.
"It really is though lol. Khris Middleton and Jrue had great back to back games but most of the time that isn‚Äôt the case, they also benefitted from Trae being hurt. Just because the bucks have a better overall squad doesn‚Äôt mean losing your 2x mvp and dpoy doesn‚Äôt affect that squad more. They just took on the challenge a lot better than Atlanta."
But overall you get khris Middleton!
But overall you get khris Middleton!
"I'm fine with either winning. I'd like to see cp3 win a championship and I'm fine with the bucks winning cause Khris Middleton is from South Carolina, and I always like seeing people from my home state be successful."
Khris Middleton going supernova for a quarter once every 3 games
"Middleton was never going to reach his heights with SVGs development staff. Wish he had shown more in Detroit so I could really root for him, but I remember more of Derrun Hilliard  than of Khris in a pistons jersey."
"No. Giannis gets reduced from a superstar to a star every post season when they play a team that can keep him from the rim. They nearly got swept last year against the Heat with Crowder. You stop Giannis (all you need is adequate rim protection and a defender big, strong, and athletic enough to keep him from the rim, i.e. Jae Crowder), then it‚Äôs your team vs Khris Middleton. If you have any real star power then the series is over. It‚Äôs how the Bucks have failed every single year because at least a couple of teams are built like that.  The only difference between this year and every other year is the Bucks have played a hobbled Nets team with no rim protection and a hobbled Hawks team with no depth.  Barring injury, the Bucks don‚Äôt really have a chance"
Woah I didn‚Äôt expect thsi level of backlash from pistons fans  I was more talking about how khris Middleton was a throw in peice and the main prize from the trade was Brandon knight. So the bucks ended up getting much more value out of that trade.  You think I would ever speak ill of my prophet
I am very okay with Khris becoming Celtics Middleton all the time.

"Unless the guy you're talking to is someone like, say, the person responsible for something like the BP oil spill, it would be pretty hard for your comment to be true.  Marv Albert is supposed to be the play-by-play guy.  The guy responsible for telling you who is doing what during that game.  Except, even sitting courtside, he can manage to confuse Pat Connaughton with *Brook Lopez*, or PJ Tucker with Khris Middleton (repeatedly).  Or call the name of a player who isn't on either team.  Or make up a name of a player who doesn't exist in the league.  Or say that a player on one team is in fact on the other team.  Or can't tell if a call is out of bounds or a foul, despite the referee clearly signaling what it is (and with the other call not making sense given what's going on on the floor while Marv is confused and talking).  Or can't tell if a shot is a three pointer even if the shooter is 2 feet inside the line.  I mean, it's literally the job of the play-by-play guy, and he's been incapable of doing it for many years now.  That makes him just about as bad at his job as someone can be."
Oh! A spectacular move by Khris Middleton.
"The flak they received were mostly from media members who thought Middleton was not a star. All I can remember from last two years is people saying shit like ‚ÄúOh you are at crunch time in a close game, other team has Durant taking the shots and you have Khris Middleton, you have no chance‚Äù  Thankfully he absulotely proved them wrong this year."
You guys could easily win but it all depends on whether you get Khash Middleton or Khris Middleton
"As a Heat fan, few players in the league scare me as much as Khris Middleton.  Absolutely ridiculous shot making ability from someone with a bicycle seat head."
"This title should be ""Khris Middleton sets a career-high for points in a quarter"".  Your title just sounds like click bait"
"If khris Middleton leads the bucks past the Suns, where does that put him all time?"
"yeah so excited to see chris paul &amp; devin booker vs khris middleton and jrue holiday, just what I expected and wanted"
This is a good problem to have. Khris middleton FMVP inbound motherfuckers
1. Cade Cunningham - Khris Middleton 2. Jalen Green - Zach LaVine 3. Jalen Suggs - Baron Davis 4. James Bouknight - Brandon Roy-lite 5. Evan Mobley - Pau Gasol 6. Jonathan Kuminga - Jamal Mashburn 7.

"If Giannis is healthy I‚Äôll take the Bucks in 6, maybe 7   Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday have really stepped up lately compared to say Devin Booker who struggled games 2-5 against the clippers."
Now they're saying it's Khris Middleton
"Damn, can‚Äôt believe they really gave Khris Middleton Giannis Antetokoumpo"
I hope this puts an end to the Khris Middleton is overpaid saga.
There is no stopping a hot Khris Middleton. The tougher the D the more likely the shot is to go in.
"Hopefully a breeze of air conditioning, because that place in July is hotter than Khris Middleton was in the 3rd quarter."
Brook Lopez looking like his Nets all star self and Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday are doing WORK with the scoring load with Giannis out. Suns vs Bucks about to be a gooooood fucking series!
Khris Middleton made a statement today: ‚ÄúTHIS IS MY TEAM‚Äù
He looks and feels like a young khris Middleton. What a piece
Khris Middleton made a statement today: ‚ÄúTHIS IS MY TEAM‚Äù
"Oh, he dragged Khris middleton and Jrue holiday to a chip. Get real"
The Milwaukee Bucks won the championship with Khris Middleton as our second best player  The Milwaukee Bucks won the championship with Giannis unable to shoot threes and consistently airballing free throws  The Milwaukee Bucks won the championship with Bud as our the coach  The Milwaukee Bucks won the championship without Brogdon.   The Milwaukee Bucks won the championship.
Khris Middleton FMVP right?
BEST CLOSEOUT GAME EVER. Khris Middleton fmvp my ass
"Nba champion pj tucker, nba champion brook lopez, nba champion jrue holiday, nba champion khris middleton and nba champion giannis antetokounmpo"

So happy for Khris Middleton. Dude gets a lot of slack but had finally proved himself.
"Giannis doesn't need a jumpshot, he's got a Khris Middleton"
Booker isn‚Äôt the next Kobe. Khris Middleton is closest to Kobe today lmao his shots in the 4th so Kobe esque at times.

Khris Middleton playing like Klay did in game 6 in the 2015 finals.
"Honestly, I'd breakdown the problems for the Suns as:  Jrue Holiday making CP3 and Booker's life hell  Ayton being neutralized by the Lopez/Portis/Giannis 3 headed monster  Khris Middleton greening every jumpshot down the stretch  Giannis being the Greek God of basketball"
"Ayton, CP &amp; Booker versus‚Ä¶ what, Giannis &amp; Khris Middleton?"
Khris Middleton made history today by being the only 2nd round draft pick to be the 2nd option on a championship winning team in the modern era of the NBA. Khris was picked 39th overall.

Not what I‚Äôm talking about. A star player getting a cheap third foul in the second quarter is bullshit. Swallow the whistle for Booker on his 6th but by all means call Khris Middleton for getting hooked by Ayton
"Ayton was holding onto Middleton, how the fuck is that on Khris?!"
"Dear Khris Middleton, please show them why we call you the Boston Strangler. Please. We're scared of you and we also respect you. Please get it done."
Okay here's my take:  Mikal Bridges is more like a Khris Middleton and the Suns are fucking up using him like he's Trevor Ariza

Any good nicknames for Khris Middleton or is it just Midds
Where/how do you rank Khris Middleton? What tier would he fall in?
"Khris ""Michael Jordan"" Middleton"
"Because one hypothetical is simply being healthy, as a healthy Harden shooting like shit is better than playing Shamet for the Nets universally. Having healthy players is a valid concern when looking at hypotheticals  Your team shooting a tad better with a bit more variance is plausible if you rolled the dice 100 times if there was a way to simulate the series, but Khris Middleton specifically is not shooting that well in the playoffs regardless.   He's a reg season player whose playstyle drops his value in the playoffs the more difficult his opponent because of his lack of a durable game. He doesn't have the size or athleticism to consistently get separation, and scoring is most of his game, with the only reliable scoring tool he has is the midrange fadeaways.   It's similar to a lot of wings like Randle or Siakam drop off in the playoffs in a big role; lack of a durable scoring game, but Middleton doesn't have the defense.  Even if you guys play at your best, you lose to a fully healthy Nets in 5, maybe 6."
"KHRIS ""CAN'T MISS"" MIDDLETON"
"The Bucks are set up for victory tonight. They've outplayed the Suns the last three games. Incredible clutch performances from Giannis. Jrue Holiday getting hot. Khris Middleton putting up numbers. The long-sought prophecy, Bucks in 6, Jennings in the building, Kareem and Oscar watching, a chance to win at home, 65k outside the area. Depending on who you believe even the refs are on their side. They've been treated almost as victors before they've even won. The Bucks winning would be the poetic outcome.  But Wisconsin can't have shit but the Packers, so the Bucks are totally gonna blow it. Suns in 7."
"i mean this year was an easy path for him. Miami Heat - Severely Injured Nets team - Hawks team with Trae and Giannis both out for games and then he had tremendous help from Khris Middleton, and defensive effort from Jrue, PJ, and Brook. It‚Äôs kinda like LeBron in his eastern conference days but with a lot more help"
"Lol it happens to everyone. Khris middleton got mauled by booker and didnt get a foul. You‚Äôre just too focused on lebron. Nba refs are trash in general.  They literally changed a rule that kicking out their feet is now an offensive foul. You know, part of the fouls that booker and harden get."
"Im not. Im just saying that if they aren't as good as you think they are, they wouldn't be here already.   Plus, what compells people to think that this Suns team couldn't beat these teams at full strength anyways? The fact that Giannis is balling out? That Khris Middleton can catch fire? That, game 3 aside, they've remained very competitive in this series and have had unfortunate bad plays?  I just think it's a fairly shallow argument used because these aren't two large market teams. They haven't shown anything substantial to suggest that they'd be rolled over so easily against these teams. Plus, like I said before, we can just keep coming up with hypotheticals to discredit almost anyone anyways."
"1. You‚Äôre providing absolutely no proof or context to your claims. You‚Äôre just stating generic takes like his passing, court vision, help defense and effort (???) are lacking while providing absolutely no proof to back up any of those claims. You‚Äôre the one essentially trolling here, just strolling into a thread to shit on a player with no evidence and throwing a fit when you get called on it   2. So because he‚Äôs not a *top 10 player* in the NBA, he‚Äôs bad and overrated? Holy hell. He‚Äôs definitely top 15-20 at the moment, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen anybody realistically claim he‚Äôs top 10. You‚Äôre just setting up straw man arguments to make yourself look better here   3. Tatum has already had better seasons that Khris Middleton has ever had, not to mention he‚Äôs already a more complete player and was probably a more complete player than Middleton as of two years ago. I‚Äôll give you the benefit of the doubt I guess, but it really seems to me like you‚Äôve never even watched either of the two play if these are the conclusions you‚Äôre drawing"
"It‚Äôs not dumb at all. The bucks were missing their regular shots while the Suns went apeshit in the first quarter. After that the Suns offense was bad outside of Booker and wide open Ayton looks because of Defense on booker   Here‚Äôs a summary of bookers makes in the 3rd   1. Step back make on pj off a screen  2. P&amp;r jumper off ayton screen 3. Contested shot after Middleton was playing great D  4. Contested jumpshot on PJ (pj fell to floor, so he was open momentarily after having to go through PJ) 5. Contested left hand layup vs brook lopez  6. Double teamed, passed the ball to payne and had an open uncontested layup   4th quarter   1. Step back on jrue  2. Contested and one layup  3. Reverse layup vs jrue  4. Drove past Giannis, layup  5. Fadeaway contested  3 on Jrue   Keep in mind the rest of his misses were contested shots and that the bucks held a double digit lead   If you go look at the Bucks makes, most of them were wide open looks or within the flow of the offense outside of Khris having some MJ mode in him   TLDR:   ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è had Booker not been hitting all those contested hard shots, that game was a blowout because the bucks had a way easier time scoring"
"Khris Middleton was drafted by the Pistons, played in their dleague/gleague affiliate for a year and was part of a deal for Brandon Jennings.  The Bucks spent a decent amount to get Jrue."
"2020-21: Steph Curry (I'd say KD, but he only played 35 games)  2019-20: Carmelo Anthony  2018-19: Blake Griffin  2017-18: Khris Middleton  2016-17: Joel Embiid (does that count?)  2015-16: Paul George"
That's not true because I heard Khris Middleton is our Batman and Giannis is just our Robin.
"&gt; There would be no game deciding shot to take without the absolute work Giannis put in  Same goes for Jrue and Khris or does Jrue's defense on CP3 not matter? Khris hitting all the big shots doesn't matter I suppose, as well.   &gt;Just because he didn't take the last shot doesn't instantly devalue him as a player.  Well when you declare him the most ""valuable"" guy but he can't even be relied upon to take a jumpshot or free throw, aren't we just redefining ""valuable"" at that point?  &gt;Giannis a third option to Holiday and Middleton?  ........?  There have been 5 times this playoffs the game has come down to a final shot in that manner, Jrue took 2 of them and Khris took the other 3.   Shouldn't the first option have all of them? Or maybe even attempted one? Interesting standards you hold that ""first option"" to, must be nice for him considering he knows he doesn't have to take important shots on crucial possessions to be a #1 option apparently."
"They probably meant it in the sense of ""2nd round pick from Texas A&amp;M who develops into an All-Star.""   Not ""Khris Middleton is gonna grow up to 7-1."""
"I don‚Äôt agree with you pulling Khris Middleton into this. He inexplicably shits the bed even when they build a wall specifically for Giannis. Against Toronto in 2019 he had 1 good game and was bad for the rest, Miami last year he had 2 good games and against Orlando he was kind of bad in general. Against the Nets, where I was actively rooting for the Bucks to win, the way him and Jrue were playing like shit offensively made me wish that the Nets would win instead and he played like shit against the Hawks game 1. Wade being bad in 2013 isn‚Äôt comparable to Khris Middleton who doesn‚Äôt have a  major injury history, or one in general to consistently be shit when in the regular season he‚Äôs a good midrange shooter and 3pt shooter."
I also think Khris Middleton gets schafted by Bud's lack of an offensive scheme because it looks like he's underutilized to me
"&gt; Hunter and Reddish  That they haven't been playing is why I didn't mention them. I think the biggest mismatch problem in this series for Atlanta is Khris Middleton who played like hot garbage in game 1.  The only guy who can realistically guard him is Solomon Hill, but he's useless offensively. If I was Bud, I'd match Solomon Hill's minutes exactly with Bryn Forbes so that there was a place to hide Forbes on defense (That dude makes Trae look like Gary Payton) while making your guards defend him on the offensive end.  If Hunter was playing, that would solve those issues completely IMO."
"&gt; He certainly wasn't a great coach but Milwaukee showed vast improvement from his first season there to his last season there.  This is just categorically untrue. Everything was worse by the end. In his 1st season, he employed an aggressive, blitzing defensive scheme that led to us having the second-best defensive efficiency rating in the NBA. But the whole league figured it out by his 2nd year and he never changed it. Our defensive rating went from 2nd to 22nd to 19th to 25th at the time he was fired in his last season.  He never improved schematically as a coach and had zero answers when things went wrong. He would always just blame ""energy and effort"" (get used to that phrase) and took to blaming the team's youth for his shortcomings toward the end of his tenure (the roster overall was fairly young, but the core outside of Giannis really wasn't).  And he continued to make some of his most brain-dead decisions up until the very end. There was a game about a month before he was fired where we were up 3 with 1.4 seconds left against Cleveland. He instructed Khris Middleton to intentionally miss his free throw so we could avoid the possibility of a 4-point play. I'm not kidding, that's 100% real. Not long before that, there was a game where we led by 4 against Detroit with 10 seconds left and intentionally fouled career 86% FT shooter Reggie Jackson, justifying it with this gem:   &gt; They‚Äôre trying to play the game of quick twos to save their timeouts, so we‚Äôll just play the free-throw game with them. I believe that my guys will make the free throws. They miss one and it works. It‚Äôs a free-throw game no matter what, but we wanted to send them to the line  He was a dreadful in-game coach from start to finish in Milwaukee and he didn't make up for it by being some phenomenal players' coach. He reportedly wasn't even on speaking terms with Jabari Parker by the end and Malcolm Brogdon barely hid his disdain for Kidd. Giannis liked him, but that says much more about Giannis than Kidd.  Maybe he's learned a lot since then (mostly in terms of player relations, it's extremely difficult for me to imagine him achieving close to competency as an in-game coach) and won't be as much of a disaster as he was here. He wasn't Jim Boylen levels of bad in player management, but I honestly do think this is closer to hiring Boylen than it is a ""shades of gray"" situation like you're saying."
"In the 2013 playoffs Wade averaged 16/5/5 on 50% TS. Bosh was at 12/7/2 on 52% TS.   For reference, Khris Middleton is putting up 23/8/4 on 53% TS and people are still saying he hasn‚Äôt been good enough help for Giannis."
"I personally don't think he should be allowed a pre-shot routine either. These are the rules and they should enforce them. I can understand a moving screen not being called from time to time. They're harder to call due to things happening in game speed and contrary to what this thread things...they do get called especially if they are egregious. Giannis taking 12-14 seconds to shoot a freethrow is something thats objectively confirmed, no grey areas, no 50/50, it is happening and the refs know it and he's the only player thats doing this right now. So he should be called for it. If it was KD, Ben Simmons, Khris Middleton doing this....most fans would expect it to be called as well."
&gt; khris middleton saying giannis being homeless in greece helped him mentally get tough enough for missing free throws in the playoffs  This sounds like a modelo ad
Espn‚Äôs coverage is the same shitty burger king or modelo commercials on repeat with statefarm ads playing inbetween       And then Rachel Nicols telling a story that absolutely did not happen or a story that she had to basically force a player to say by leading him overtly with questions         Like she honestly told a story that khris middleton saying giannis being homeless in greece helped him mentally get tough enough for missing free throws in the playoffs      Im paraphrasing but i was listening to that and thinking this did not happen. This is a fake story or she basically guided Middleton to this conclusion
"&gt;	Because everyone was in the paint.  Which they were abusing with the Giannis and Jrue PnR.         I definitely think the ball should have been in the hands of those two, instead of Khris Middleton and Pat."
"That roster was pretty close to .500 roster, so I don't see that as much of an overachievement. That roster had an MVP in giannis, a good #2 in Middleton and a decent rotation around them. In the trash ass east, that should be a .500 team. He gets credit for not fucking it up that year. Then he underachieved a shit ton when they lost 49 games with giannis and Middleton only missing 5 games combined in the trash ass east. Season after that winning 42 without khris most of the season was ok, but he followed it up with starting 23-22, before his replacement went 21-16. That's not the CV of a good coach. He also went 0-2 in the playoffs for the bucks. As for the nets, the nets actually dropped from 49 wins to 44 in Kidd's year. Seriously PJ Carlisimo was a much better coach for the Nets than Kidd lol. And going 1-1 with the nets brings his playoff series record to 1-3 in the trash ass east. He's not a good coach. In my book he underachieved. And that's not counting the off court concerns with Kidd. Steph and Klay talk about how much Mark Jackson helped them. That doesn't change the fact that the world's greatest offense was fucking taking turns isoing and throwing away games under mark or that mark is a shit coach, who happens to be liked."
Khris Middleton is taking that advice to heart the last 2 weeks.
"Players in Milwaukee DID NOT love Kidd. Giannis gave his support in the way Giannis is positive and upbeat on everything. Brogdon HATED Kidd and as coach he encouraged rivalry and icy relationships between Giannis/Jabari/Middleton. None of them really got along, despite all three being pretty affable people. Only after Kidd left did Giannis and Khris develop a friendship and chemistry."
"Middleton has low lows and much higher highs than CJ, and at least plays passable defense even when his shot is not falling. CJ for khris would put the nail in the coffin for this bucks roster never winning a ring"
"I think our real problem is attracting talent.  Post-Hibbert PG13 Pacers could have been great. Instead it was a team with Monta Ellis as the 2nd option  2015 FA (some were restricted I think):  Kawhi, Marc Gasol, Kevin Love, Aldridge, Jimmy Butler, Brook Lopez, Danny Green, Khris Middleton, Reggie Jackson (PG13's long time friend and aspiring teammate), Rondo   2016 FA: KD, Conley, Horford, Derozan, Whiteside, Howard, Batum, Beal, Barnes, Bazemore, Gasol, Jordan Clarkson, Eric Gordon     We also traded a first round pick and still landed on a lineup of:  Teague  Monta Ellis   Paul George  Thad Young  Myles Turner (20 y/o)  w/ either Lance Stephenson, CJ Miles, or Rodney Stuckey as our 6th man  --------------  This is why I don't harbor resentment towards PG13. He asked for help and we did fuck all. And, while I think that is more because the market than the FO, not every player can be expected to be Reggie and stick it out through thick and thin. He's from Cali, wants to win or play in Cali or both, fine. We don't offer winning, well, it's done for.   But I think our mediocrity has little to do with it. While the Hawks and Suns did fantastically tanking in our time since PG13 the Pistons, Knicks, Magic, Kings, and more have seen little reward for it."
"I didn't say he was a scrub. He's probably been one of the best performers in these playoffs. Ignoring Trae, Durant etc. I've actually become a fan of him. But that doesn't change the point of discussion. Players like Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, Khris Middleton, and Drue Holiday are proven stars across the league. Collins isn't. So they're under-performing while he is over-performing. Just because a guy puts up 20 points in the regular season, doesn't mean he's going to show up in the playoffs. Most guys don't. Espcially their first one."

Cj and Nurkic for Khris Middleton?
"I mean, there's moments where fans can see Bud and Doc making highly questionable decisions. While Connaughton and Middleton threes might be solid looks in a vacuum or in a regular season game, you have to make that in-game adjustment. Both of those guys were cold and Jrue was on fire. The Jrue/Giannis pick and roll murdered the Hawks down the stretch and got Giannis two or three easy dunks. Why did they go away from that? At the least I would have liked to see more of Giannis screening for Jrue on those final possessions that ended with Pat and Khris misses."
Khris Crickets is good. I just call him Krud Middleton.
Khris ‚Äú0-9‚Äù Team USA Middleton
"So a 9 footer baseline is midrange but a 13 footer isn‚Äôt?   That‚Äôs not even math guy. That‚Äôs blindly following some loose definition.   Cp3 takes 12 footers at the elbow, all the time.   https://www.forbes.com/sites/andybailey/2020/04/27/chris-paul-khris-middleton-and-the-nbas-10-most-prolific-mid-range-shooters-in-2019-20/?sh=aeb932160bb2  Forbes and many other writers highlights 10 footers as mid range.. but in your very strict interpretation. A 10-14 foot shoot in the paint is close range But a 9 foot rip hamilton special is midrange   Makes sense!   Btw Note CJ in this article as a prolific mid range player..   Also note MJ said the mid range shot is the hardest to guard   Also note the mid range shot opens up the offense for everyone  Also note you said CJ takes bad midrange shots. But he‚Äôs prolific. Lmao."
Hackers are kinda dumb. If you were gonna hack Giannis or some famous player at least make it somethint juicy. If you hacked Giannis just like only a few things about khris Middleton being ass or hating khris Middleton. That would stir some real drama.
"You should be enjoying the playoffs right now then. You‚Äôve got guys like Kyrie, KD, Khris Middleton, Devin Booker, Trae Young, Kawhi Leonard, CP3, Jokic, Embiid, Tobias Harris all making a killing in the mid range this postseason. It may not be in the regular season but this postseason has seen the return of the mid range game. And it‚Äôs awesome."
"Of the 17 games Middleton shot above 50% from the field  8 of them came against the Celtics  Fuck you too, Khris"
Khris Middleton
"How many role players have to miss open three point shots in crucial moments in the playoffs for people to understand that these aren't the right plays, ESPECIALLY when it's a 3-PT shot.  There's a reason Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton get paid 86 million a year combined and Pat Connaughton gets paid 4 million, Connaughton isn't a great shooter and a 3 there is a mistake anyways.  Every time this situation comes up i always say this: If you are LeBron James or Giannis or whomever it is, you are giving the defense a favor when you pass to a role player in a crucial moment, that's EXACTLY what they want and that's why Kyle Korver or Danny Green or, in this case Pat Connaughton, is wide open. Part of what makes a great player a GREAT player is being reliable in clutch moments, that's not the same for a role player.  And before people ask ""But what about Jordan passing to Kerr?"", That was a two pointer right around the foul line, my opinion completely changes if its a layup or a WIDE OPEN 12 footer."
Tbh Middleton and Khris have been so inconsistent the last 2 series you can‚Äôt really depend on them.
Khris Middleton is weak. Hawks too good.   Young kept missing at the 3 line but his floater was pure T E R R O R. God dayum.
He's Khris Middleton then he's Kate Middleton
I mean u got khris middleton in a trade so that helps
They got a total nobody name Khris Middleton as a throw in when they traded Brandon Jennings so that helped.
The 4th quarter bucks is just Giannis differing to Jrue or Khris Middleton and getting a dunk off a lob every now and then
&gt;Khris played like shit  Nice to meet you Kvon. Hes a great defender. Middleton huerter match up is huge
Khris Middleton bby
Your 2nd all-star Khris Middleton should shoot better.
"The Hawks deserve this win. Trae Young balled out. We lost because Trae Young's ability to take over a game. Coach Buds play calling and inability to make adjustments, Khris Middleton not showing up. Giannis can't do it alone. He needs his #2 every game. Hawks aren't gonna be easy."
"This loss is on Trea Young's ability to take over a game, Coach Bud not having the team make any adjustments on Trae, Buds play calling, and Khris Middleton not showing up. Giannis cannot do it alone. Jrue was a good option tonight but Giannis needs his #2 in playoffs every game."
They needed Khris Middleton to not have an urge to go into construction. You can't have your 2nd guy go 6/23
"i'm not defending bud, he needs to be fired, but every time i watch khris middleton shoot 5-25 this sub goes ""it's all buds fault!"". like maybe if middleton could manage shooting 35% the bucks win this game"
I was taking a nice nap on the couch during the Bucks vs. Hawks game when an explosion startled me awake. It turns out the sound was just Khris Middleton bricks clanging off the rim again. Keep it down Khris!
Jrue was cooking them with the pick and roll with Giannis with Middleton having an ass game and we stopped going to Jrue for multiple possessions and just let Khris run the offense. Why were we running shit through Khris when Jrue was the one controlling the game?
was taking a nice nap on the couch during the Bucks vs. Hawks game when gunshots rang out and startled me awake. It turns out the sound was just Khris Middleton 3 point bricks clanging off the rim again. Keep it down Middlebum!
Yeah and Khris Middleton shit the bed
was taking a nice nap on the couch during the Bucks vs. Hawks game when gunshots rang out and startled me awake. It turns out the sound was just Khris Middleton 3 point bricks clanging off the rim again. Keep it down Middlebum!

"Somehow we managed to sign Julius Randle, Ben Simmons and Khris Middleton in the postseason. We might be spooky"
All I want to know is where the fuck is this Khris Middleton when the Bucks play the Celtics?????  Dude morphs into fucken prime Steph Curry for some damn reason.
34 12 9 on 54% shooting yeah....... how bout you watch a game and you will clearly see coach Bud is atrocious and Khris Middleton didn't help 0/9 from 3
Pistons legend Khris Middleton
There is something deeply wrong about Khris Middleton
"Everyone has bad games, Middleton just saves all of his for the playoffs lmaoü§£   I can see it now: ESPN 30 for 30 presents,  ""If he even played replacement level basketball the bucks easily win this game: A khris middleton story"""
"Jrue, Giannis both were good but that was an absolute disasterclass from Middleton. Khris was 0-9 from 3s. That is unacceptable lmao."
Khris Middleton legacy game
"since the start of the nets series khris middleton is shooting 38,8% from the field and 31,1% from three."
Jrue was scorching and Middleton was playing like he was tall and introduced to basketball 12 weeks ago. Maybe say ‚Äúif jrue is smothered then khris shoots it‚Äù but jrue was open
Trae   Giannis   Jrue   Ballboys   Random fans   Brook Lopez   A dog   Toddler   Garbage Can   Khris Middleton.     I think that's rated correctly.
"So when will people agree that Khris Middleton shits the bed way too often in the playoffs? He's so inconsistent. 6/23 this game, 9-26 last game vs Nets. Dudes inconsistency is straight up screwing the bucks over."
Khris Middleton with the whopping 6-32 from the floor.  Holy brick layer.
Why is Khris Middleton so inconsistent?
"Khris Middleton 0-8 for 3s on the night, shoots the final shot LMAOOOOO"
KHRIS MIDDLETON SHOT 0-8 THE WHOLE GAME THEN DECIDED TO SHOOT THE THREE AT THE END
Khris Middleton 0-6320 on the night. Better let him take the last shot lmfao
Khris Middleton is the definition of fraud. Deserves more shit than Ben &amp; Pandemic P easily for this performance
Khris Middleton is trash
"Let me guess, Contested Khris Middleton 3 pt shot"
Bucks got out hustled after going up 7. 4 offensive rebounds in 5 trips.  Khris middleton took a shot with 44 seconds left with like 15 on the clock left.
Khris Middleton lost the game for the Bucks
Khris Middleton should give back his game check
So we not going to talk about how terrible Khris Middleton is playing tonight?  A whopping 6-30 from the field.
Khris Middleton never hesitates to chuck the ball huh
Khris Middleton is junk
How does Khris Middleton seem to take the worst possible shot every time unless it‚Äôs that mid range jumper
I have a bad feeling about a certain someone named Khris Middleton
Khris Middleton flying under the radar with how ass he is
Such is Khris Middleton.  Rare to see it at home though.

Khris Middleton is shooting 26% and 0% from 3.
Khris ‚ÄúHoudini‚Äù Middleton with the disappearing act
Fuck Khris Middleton
Middleton doing his best 2019 Khris Middleton in the ECF impression
khris middleton on that bullshit tonight
Why don't teams just put a Khris Middleton or Giannis on Trae Young and make John Collins or Bogdan beat you? Would Trae cook them? How have the Hawks made it this far?
also more or less Giannis and Jrue against the Hawks given how most of the team either hasn't shot the ball very much or is Khris Middleton
"I already thought Cade was the clear #1, but after I saw that article where he named Khris Middleton as the main player he watches, I was absolutely sold on him. That shows really high basketball IQ and high IQ in general, where he's watching players specifically to scout out little advantages that he can apply to his own strengths and weaknesses. It was way more impressive than if he gave a generic ""oh yeah, I watch LeBron and stuff a lot"" type answer."
"Cleveland is the Khris Middleton of Cities. It's not your first option, but it's pretty good"
"LeBron James, Michael Jordan, and soon, Khris Middleton"
"Khris Middleton over Love, KLove deserves no love"
"your bucks are not that good lmfao. you got the ‚ÄúMVP‚Äù ‚ÄúDPOY‚Äù Giannis, Khris Middleton and Jrue and they could barely get passed the broken down Nets. Suns are going to burn the Bucks alive"
Damian Lillard / Jrue Holiday  Bradley Beal / Zach LaVine / Devin Booker  Jayson Tatum / Khris Middleton  Kevin Durant / Jerami Grant  Bam Adebayo / Draymond Green / Kevin Love  Kind of an odd roster but they're so good it should still be a pretty easy job to get gold.
"He also mentioned (saw it somewhere in an article) that he watches Khris Middleton a lot as well. It makes sense considering Middleton isn't athletic but can get to his spots to get his shots off.   As long as Cade knows how to do it in the NBA level, he'll be fine. He just needs to tighten the handle. His floor is likely a fringe all-star but ceiling likely be a top 5-10 NBA player in the league."
Bunch of all stars and great players  Also Khris Middleton is there
"Because they don't have an offensive blackhole in Simmons? Giannis is obv a great player while Middleton has come up consistently in these playoffs and can drop 30+ himself as well, Khris is averaging 23, Jrue ain't doing that badly either, where he's failing in offense he's doing MUCH better on the defensive end and overall outside of Seth Curry I'd say the Sixers role play worse than the Bucks role players."
"I think the Bucks won‚Äôt be fun, I don‚Äôt particularly enjoy watching Giannis and Khris Middleton is a boring as fuck second banana. Don‚Äôt really like the Bucks aesthetically.  But Suns and the Hawks? Holy shit."
"Welcome to the Eastern Conference Finals, Khris Middleton."
"Man, Khris Middleton either plays badly or godly. There's no in between."

Khris. Fucking. Middleton.
Thank God for Olympian Khris Middleton
"The Bucks had their 2 best players play exactly like 2 All Stars should -- combining for 71 points between Antetokounmpo and Middleton.  Giannis Antetokounmpo dropped 33 points, attempting only 2 threes (making one), shooting an efficient 62% from the field.  But Khris Middleton took over and finished with 38/7/11, 20 of those in the 4^th, including a stretch where he was on absolute fire hitting 3 threes and a step back jumper for 11 points in 2 minutes."

Khris Middleton out there looking like a bootleg Coolio.
instead of playing basketball everyone should just vote on who‚Äôs uglier between khris middleton and trae and the winner goes to the finals
Khris Middleton playing like Khris Middlechild
Khris Middleton thinks Khris Middleton has been fouled on every possession.
"Damn there's being a hypocrite, and then there's being a hawks fan crying about hard fouls on giannis taking it to the rim or khris middleton drawing a foul"
Is Khris Middleton tired or something? Did he not get any sleep?
"I've never seen a player get less respect from the refs than Khris Middleton has in this game.  This legit seems personal. He's gotten straight up, no doubt about it fouled 3 or 4 times and nothing."
I can already see it: Khris Middleton is going to have a HoF performance but the Bucks still lose.
"Khris ""Trae Young"" Middleton"
Khris Middleton already selling
bucks can argue khris middleton was bad in the first half if we go buy your fuck logic where everything has to be perfect. Trae Young had a career-best game and won cuz of offensive rebounds in the end. But hey trae can prove me wrong by popping for 50 again.
Cade is not all that tbh. He‚Äôs Khris Middleton with passing ability. Warriors would‚Äônt do that
They should trade Dame for Khris Middleton
"People don‚Äôt understand that with the NBA cap rules, there is often times no real difference between giving a max and giving something just less. For instance, the bucks a couple off seasons ago had no cap space at all. Khris Middleton was a FA but he can resign because of bird rights. At that point, there was no real difference as to whether to give Khris 30 mil a year of 40 mil a year for the max. Same goes for so many players"
"Giannis took down the NBA Champion favorite Nets and is probably going to beat the Hawks in five. What team is left that can take down the Bucks? Suns? Clippers?   They're up against a two time MVP at 26 years old and all star Khris Middleton.   Bucks got this one, no doubt in my mind."
Bro there's no maybe about it lmao. If you take Giannis off this team with no meaningful replacement... A team whose best player is Khris Middleton is for sure tanking...
"First of all, I‚Äôd just like to point out that All-Star selections are never based totally on the few weeks of regular season basketball we get before the All-Star break. You can‚Äôt objectively remove yourself from knowing a player‚Äôs history and their role within their team.  Second, while the Jay‚Äôs may have both been averaging 25 or whatever as you mention, what you fail to mention is they really hadn‚Äôt played much together up to that point. Tatum had missed a good chunk of the season up to that point with Covid, and so Brown was operating as the de-facto #1 option on offense. Predictably, Tatum came back to resume his role.   And when it comes to Tatum vs. Middleton. I would‚Äôve taken Khris. He was healthy up to that point, averaged 5 PPG less on 6 fewer shots, and so he had the edge in efficiency, passing, and defense to go along with availability and team success. Just objectively, I think the Bucks are closer to three All-Stars than the Celtics are to two."
"13% of the Bucks plays during the post season have been isolation plays. Clippers are at 14%, Hawks &amp; Suns at 7%  I take your point that it's more isolation than you'd like but pretending that's all they run is just facetious.  Budenholzer has always had a rep as a defensive coach.  Heres a good bit on the Bucks offensive improvements from the Miami series [clicky](https://behindthebuckpass.com/2021/05/28/milwaukee-bucks-mike-budenholzer-pushing-right-buttons-postseason/)  &gt;On the offensive end, we‚Äôve seen the team play with much more structure and motion than a season ago. Rather than using Giannis Antetokounmpo as the primary ball handler on most possessions in the half-court, the Bucks have been increasingly using him more frequently as a screener or roller in pick-and-roll situations with Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton.  &gt;The team has also been setting more off-ball screens away from the main play to create room for shooters and cutters. This has created more space for players to get open shots at the rim in the corners or above the break spots. This has especially benefited guys like Bryn Forbes, whose dynamic shooting ability has given the team something they sorely lacked in their past two post-season trips.  &gt;Three other areas that the Bucks have found success on offense is through their more aggressive ball movement, greater use of transition, especially in secondary transition opportunities and a clear intent to attack mismatches when they create them."
"Hey OP, this is great work, but I wanted to ask you. The Hawks haven't guarded the Bucks well so far. With a lineup of Giannis-Middleton-Jrue-Lopez-PJ, what should the Hawks do defensively?  I think that the Hawks needs to double either Jrue, Giannis, or Khris when they have the ball, and dare PJ to score 30 for the Bucks to win. If Giannis drives to the rim, what the Hawks should do is force him to drive to the side of the court where PJ is. If Jrue or Khris drives, then the person guarding Giannis or PJ can come closer to the paint and dare Giannis to have to score from a jumper, or risk getting a charge call if he wants to drive. Do you agree?  Replace Lopez with Portis, and I feel the Hawks defensive strategy shouldn't change too much."
Khris Middleton
"I made a post about Bucks playing drop coverage some days ago if you care reading that - it's titled ""Giannis shouldn't guard KD"" or something, I think it sums up what was wrong with our defense in the Nets series and game 1 of the ECF.  Offensively, there's usually no ball movement. We did move the ball this game but usually you see Middleton ISO, Giannis ISO, Jrue ISO. It fucking sucks, especially when Khris who's our best ISO player is having a bad game. Also all 3 of them are very good passers and Lopez isn't terrible. There should be way better ball movement instead of what we're usually doing.   We also don't run PnR with Giannis rolling as much as we should. We did it in the 4th quarter last game and Giannis made 3 easy dunks. I fully expect Bud to stop doing it for some reason. We also don't utilize Brook down low, he's been so good there throughout his caree and we don't take advantage of that even when much shorter players guard him. We also rarely hunt mismatches, like Trae should be a defensive liability and I don't see us targeting him enough. Same with Harden last series.   Bud is not a good coach in the playoffs. He's lucky his team is more talented than anything we had to face so far. Even if we win it all this year, this team is playing much worse than most teams that won a ring last decade."

Khris Middleton full body shiny 3 minutes into the game
Khris Middleton is an allstar. If the bucks make it to the finals hell prove it
"Depends how long you're talking. Giannis is 26 still, it would be a big shake up by the end of his contract, but bucks could run it back with a different supporting cast. Younger superstars will also be free agents for the first time ever.   I'd love for khris and jrue to be with the bucks forever but when Giannis is 28 or 29 it's very possible we'll have a different co-star to convince Giannis to stay or not. Age will start to show for brook, jrue and Middleton in that order"
Khris Middleton at +42. Nice turn around.
Khris Middleton **+42**
Would love to see the Bucks do this the rest of the series but Khris Middleton loves shooting 25% in the playoffs
Khris Middleton is +42 right now

you guys cannot complain about trae doing that to KHRIS MIDDLETON. dude jumps into every defender he can
"Since everyone was calling Trae Young a superstar, does this now mean Khris Middleton is a superstar too?"
"I'm not gay but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with Khris ""Khash Money"" Middleton. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Khris. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love."
Khris Middleton had big Khash energy in the 3rd quarter.
"One Quarter of Khris Middleton pretty much beat the Hawks, This man is the definition of On and Off"

"Congrats to the Bucks, there's a non-zero chance that either Khris Middleton or Jrue Holiday will win Finals MVP, especially if Giannis isn't fully healthy. Might be the craziest finals MVP winner since Iggy in 2015.  Jrue has been averaging great numbers, playing so well. Rooting for this guy."
I remember some Celtics fans comparing Jaylen's potential to be as good as Khris Middleton...hilarious. The difference is as wide as the Grand Canyon.
"Congrats to the Bucks, there's a non-zero chance that either Khris Middleton or Jrue Holiday will win Finals MVP, especially if Giannis isn't fully healthy. Might be the craziest finals MVP winner since Iggy in 2015."

If Giannis plays I still have him as the Fmvp front runner. however Jrue and Khris are amazing. Jrue is like a maestro of plays and Middleton is just superb. I'm a Giannis fanboy but honestly I could see it go either way
Still got dudes on here slandering Khris Middleton. Shameful.

The absolute disrespect to Khris Middleton
"Because listening to a guy who can't tell the difference between Khris Middleton and PJ Tucker, or Pat Connaughton and *Brook fucking Lopez*, from court side, isn't a pleasurable experience for many people."
"&gt;but the idea of a true free market is mythology  Yes, every economics course deals with mythologies, that wasn't even my point, my point was that artificial ceilings on salary worked in khris' favor   &gt;You're wrong about the way that artificial ceilings distort incentives, particularly because you're talking about changes in value, not incentives  I know what Middleton's value is to the bucks, i know what I'm saying , youre misunderstanding. All I'm saying is that Middleton had the leverage to get a max contract, he isn't the same player as Giannis , and Giannis has a max , so logic dictates that khris isn't a max player, his leverage got him that contract   &gt;Middleton having the leverage to negotiate a max comes from the fact that he had an alternative options that the Bucks had to outbid.  False, his leverage comes from the fact that the bucks couldn't afford to lose him, not that another team was waiting in the wings, this is the same reason Tobias got a max contract, no other team would give him a max contract, but the sixers couldn't afford to lose him for nothing.   You get what you can leverage,"
"That is economics lol artificial ceilings are detrimental to a free market  But the NBA doesn't operate in a true free market   Rent control doesnt contract supply, developers aren't stopping building because they can only make 4% profit instead of 6%   The bucks gave Middleton a max because he had the leverage, they couldn't let him go and replace him with someone who produces the same value, thats what leverage gets you   I'm not talking about under paid or over paid because that doesn't matter, you get what you can leverage , every team in the league is not offering Khris a max, that's crazy"
"Who's insulting you? Unless you think bad take is an insult. And based on your bad takes I really doubt it, maybe twice as much highlights and boxscore watching sure but full games that's a big no and it shows. Trust me when I tell you Klay isnt even a 2nd option at all, Middleton is a million X better than him. For every good game Klay has he has 10 stinkers. He averages 55% TS because he doesn't have Steph and KD taking the pressure off him. Klay is a chucker that led the team in shots TF you talking about low usage lmao his selfish ass tried so hard to make an all nba team and had to cry to the media kemba making it over him, the guy didn't even deserve his last 2 ALLstar appearances either. Also khris is a 50/40/90, Klay is not when he absolutely should be. Goes to show how superior khris is to him. So he's a good defender but still gets abused? LOL.   And no shit they missed the playoffs he's deadweight eating close to 40million in cap space. Replace him with any decent player with the cap he's eating and warriors are comfortably contenders. Remove Middleton from the bucks and they lose in the first round... AGAIN. remove Klay from the KD warriors or replace him with Danny green and they still win regardless.   In 2015 when Cavs were up 2-1 vs the warriors, warriors won 3 games in a row to win the championship, Klay averaged 8ppg on 35% from 2 and 25% from 3 those games, dont ever say dumb shit like he's important piece to a championship ever again."
"I mean, I guess there's a world where Khris Middleton wins FMVP, especially if Giannis is out to start the series. Wouldn't bet on it though"
"Lol you don't see Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday, Brooke Lopez matching the play of Pat Beverly and Boogie? Are you fucking kidding me rofl. Jesus this sub is bad"
"Definitely the players still dealing with the plague.  You can show the aftermath, House Mavs and Heat on fire, white walkers running around, their castles partially destroyed, Jimmy Butler trying to fend them off with 2 G-Realm peasants, the muffin maker's boy, and a mangy goat but succumbing to their onslaught.  You could have a recurring joke where Giannis and Khris Middleton charge into battle, only to be pulled by Bud 30 seconds later and sent to the showers.  Every time House Bucks are going to win, they get pulled.  Trae Young and Embiid trying to out flop each other, falling down when the other coughs or something ridiculous like that, maybe a cameo by perennial flopper Manu Ginobili coming back and showing them both how its done.  Discord in House Jazz where Gobert and Mitchell don't get along, the former still touching stuff while clearly infected, but denied it saying its just a cold or something.  Lamelo and Lavar orchestrating a coup to take over House Hornets, maybe with Lonzo in the background asking his dad if he's still proud of him but Lavar ignoring him and holding the ROY trophy.  Meanwhile Liangelo is pulling the carriage that Lavar came in.  House Knicks with a resurgence but they wildly overreact and are smug like they're already champions while everyone reminds them they've sucked for years.  Meanwhile Thibs players his guys no matter what.  Arrows could be stuck in Julius Randle's back and Thibs will say he looks fine and to keep fighting."
"&gt;Khris Middleton always popping off against the Celtics  In 26 career games against the Celtics, he's averaged 16.1/5.6/4.0.  His total career average is 16.8/4.8/3.6.  Not exactly popping off."
Celtics Khris Middleton
Khris Middleton
"Khris Middleton signed a max contract. That makes him a max player. He‚Äôs a perennial all-star, and there are multiple other teams in the league that would pay him a max if he were available in free agency. You‚Äôre definition of max player is way too restrictive, and it‚Äôs also demonstrably false because there are so many players that get max deals that aren‚Äôt on your list"
You haven't watched playoffs if you think giannis is worth a ton more than middleton rn. Khris has been the go to guy when it matters.
‚ÄúActively harmful‚Äù to ‚Äúaverage‚Äù is a helluva tiebreaker. Not to mention Khris‚Äô superior playmaking. Middleton is inconsistent but he makes his team and teammates better. Redd is murdering his team when his shot isn‚Äôt dropping.   I‚Äôll take a guy who is average-to-good at lots of stuff over a chucker any day.
2017 Isaiah Thomas &gt; Any year of Khris Middleton
"no the team USA just sucks and so is Gregg Popovich being a washed up coach.      Booker, Jrue, and Khris Middleton should just stay home and not associate themselves with a joke of a team"
Danilo Gallinari is actually one of the best players in the league at this. So is Khris Middleton
"Tobias is roughly Philly's equivalent of Khris Middleton (or is it the other way around)- neither of them are ""stars"" but have the paycheck of one."
Dame should start with khris Middleton. Not with Beal.  US should focus on who is the number 1 /2/3 options. This game is just everyone trying to show off their individual skills
"Team USA desperately needs the perimeter defense of Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton, and we‚Äôre running a real risk if the Finals go long and they decide to pull out."
"Donovan Mitchell, Derrick White, Kemba Walker, Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, Mason Plumlee, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Harrison Barnes, Marcus Smart, and Joe Harris.  Not the best team we could have sent, but they definitely should have finished better than 7th."
"Fuck Khris Middleton, they've got actual shooters"
Needed Khris middleton badly

Khris Middleton is the most underrated player in the nba.
"Milwaukee needs Jrue holiday to play like he was against the Hawks, and third quarter Khris Middleton to show up"
"I really hate when comments like this are upvoted.  No, this is not like comparing Steve fucking nash or khris middleton to shaq or Jordan because these guys didn‚Äôt score nearly as much as the former.   Harden has *literally* averaged 36 a game, more then any kobe season. So no, it‚Äôs not at all like your horrible examples. Also, harden is still more efficient even when accounting for era and a much better passer. Kobe obviously has a defensive advantage.  If anything, your comment is disingenuous"
1. Giannis Antetokounmpo  2. Devin Booker  3. Chris Paul  4. Khris Middleton  5. Jrue Holiday  6. De‚ÄôAndre Ayton  7. Mikal Bridges  8. Brook Lopez  9. Jae Crowder  10. Pat Connaughton  11. Cameron Payne  12. PJ Tucker
&gt;Khris Middleton -13.0  Crash Money
"Paul George is far better than Khris Middleton. He‚Äôs more consistent too, and much better at getting to the FT line which is huge because if Middleton‚Äôs shot is off, it‚Äôs ugly out there for him.  The PG memes have made PG underrated when he‚Äôs one of the greatest SFs of the past decade"
2-0 prolly how dare u compare him to Khris MIDdleton Lool
Khris Middleton &gt; Michael Jordan
"So? Steve Nash was a more efficient scorer than Shaquille O'Neal, efficiency doesn't make one better. Saying that Harden is a more efficient scorer than Kobe doesn't disprove the notion that Kobe in his prime was better than he was nor is a relevant fact.  Saying that Harden is a more efficient scorer than Kobe is like saying that Khris Middleton is more efficient than Michael Jordan, it's a statement with zero value or relevance. Also, talking about Harden's efficiency ignoring that he is currently playing in an era where it's way easier to play offense while Kobe played in the early 2000s is disingenuous as fuck."
"Khris needs to be more consistent no one is arguing otherwise. The thing everyone conveniently ignores when they shit on him is he‚Äôs had 2 game winners in the playoffs, one of them in OT of game 7 against Brooklyn. There is no finals if Khris Middleton isn‚Äôt on this basketball team. Yes he needs to be better but there‚Äôs been way more good than bad. Also get your facts right Khris had 29 in game 1."
Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton
This narrative is silly to me.  Game 1 Giannis played bad and Middleton was forced to jack up 24ish shots iirc.   Most Bucks games I‚Äôve watched lately seems like Khris is forced to take over in the 4th because Giannis has a severely limited game and just cruises in the 4th. That was the story for game 1 for me.  Game 2 Giannis actually played great though and nobody else showed up.   The biggest problem so far has been Jrue Holiday though. Giannis has to be there in the 4th too.
"the suns aren't doing anything special on defense, khris and jrue just aren't consistent enough for the roles they have to play. you could guard middleton with a traffic cone and I wouldn't trust him to hit the shot on one of his off-days"
"i dont think middleton, jrue, and giannis have all had games shooting over 40% a single time together in these playoffs. middleton and jrue only both had good games at the same time when giannis was out during the hawks series. i think this series entirely lies upon khris middleton now"
Nah Giannis isn‚Äôt part of a heliocentric offense. Khris Middleton and Jrue had and have plenty of opportunities throughout this game. They‚Äôve shown to be inconsistent no matter the circumstances
"If the finals end without any help coming from Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday, I don't know how in the world Giannis will find the motivation to stay on the bucks"
"Look at how Holiday, Middleton, Lopez and even Portis played in those last two games against Atlanta. They shared the load that Giannis usually carries and it worked. Khris and Jrue had good games with Giannis on the court as well, but in G2 for instance, Atlanta just sucked and the Bucks won. Giannis is great, but sometimes his greatness wears on the team's level."
Don‚Äôt even talk about Khris Middleton being a star again please.
"Idk why people are acting like this is a bad loss. Don't get me wrong, we need to do better on perimeter D (although our interior D was fantastic). But Middleton and Holiday shooting the way they did on one end while the Suns couldn't miss and Booker was hitting tough shots in your face on the other end...that's always going to be a difficult game.  The game plan wasn't an issue. If Khris and Holiday even shot their averages, Bucks win."
"Because Khris Middleton and Bud.   People shit on Jrue but look at what happened early in the game. Let the fucking PG play PG and he plays better. Jesus! And Khris is just an OP Heat Check player. Once in a while, when he gets hot, he plays like a top 10 nba player but that‚Äôs it. He is not a legit number 2. He has y‚Äôall fooled running around doing nothing."
"It‚Äôs ok, Khris Middleton will go on his usual streak of remembering how to shoot the ball every three games, then disappear again.  Suns in 5!"
"TO BE FAIR, while that normally isn't the case, this stat is bogus though. You can legit attempt 25 jumpshots with zero contact whatsoever and therefore not go to the foul line. Just because you attempt a lot of shots that does not automatically mean that you should attempt FTs.  That happend with MJ in the Wizards all the time, since he was older he had transformed himself into a midrange jumpshooter, so he would have countless games with 25-30 FGA and 0 to 2 FTA. Khris Middleton is a jumpshooter, he legit averages 3.5 FTA/G, it isn't out of the ordinary for him to have 0 FTA in a game.  This stat would mean way more to me if it was Giannis with 25 FGA and 0 FTs instead of Book and Khris."
"This narrative sometimes happens when a superstar goes down and the team actually steps up in his absence. The most recent example is that awful Houston team (No Yao or TMac) beating the Clippers down 3-1. One of the god-tier examples is the 8th seed NY Knicks making the 98-99 Finals without Patrick Ewing.  In both examples, I assure you that those teams would have benefited from their star player. Skip can say nonsense because these dumb narratives flourish every couple years. Milwaukee is going to lose this series because Khris Middleton is one of the most inconsistent playoff performers and Jrue is playing like trash. If they were playing like the regular season, the Bucks would be winning games by double digits easily. Now we will have to hear hot takes about Greek Freak being a chump and not being able to win the big games. I might have to never turn on First Take or Undisputed again after these Finals üòÇ"
"&gt; Donte was in our starting lineup all season and is a young talent.  Donte hasn‚Äôt made any strides to give hope he‚Äôll be anything more than a mediocre role player. And an injury-prone one so far.   &gt;Giannis, Jrue, and Khris aren‚Äôt old.  Jrue is 31, he‚Äôs been in the league since 2009. He‚Äôs not getting any better, neither will Middleton. Giannis is in his prime. Lopez is past it. Portis is likely gone."
"Said it 3 years ago and gonna keep saying it, Khris Middleton will never be the second best player on a title team.  He's simply not that good.  And Bud should be fired the day after the season is over no matter what they do."
I'm sorry but the shots Middleton was settling for were absurd. 4 seconds into the shot clock and a contested 3... You're not that guy pal. Giannis deserves a better #2. Khris is so hot and cold/unpredictable.
"The sense that players are on their own.  ""Why do you look me like that, go draw your own plays and do whatever, just don't bother me, mmmkay?""  Guy decided that it's better to be a non coach in the NBA finals of all places. I mean it requires balls to appear so very clueless before the cameras, I must give him that, but he basically allows for a boring finals because suddenly -under him- Jrue Holiday is Drew Bledsoe and Khris Middleton is Kate Middleton.  Funny thing is that the teams are almost evenly matched personel wise, all we see in the court is a team with a plan vs one with no plan (i.e. ""play random"")"
"Remember last week when people were suing Giannis wasn‚Äôt the Batman of this team, he‚Äôs the robin. That Khris Middleton was the Batman and leader of this team?  I never want to hear that argument again. Lol"
"You guys clearly aren‚Äôt longtime Khris Middleton fans like myself. Personally I think him laying two eggs in a row is game over for the suns, man is about to go unconscious. It‚Äôs the only thing you can rely on, Middleton‚Äôs performance being up and down - and statistically it‚Äôs about to go up"

"Khris Middleton trick y'all. He aint that guy, pal. He ain't that guy."
"I get what he means in that Khris is a more ""skilled and versatile"" player on offense because he can score at all levels.  But I still prefer guaranteed 30/12 on great effieciency with dpoy defense vs a guy that has went missing regularly this post season especially on the road.

"Khris Middleton is worth any good player in the world, only if he is contracted to play every other game cus hot damn he is the most inconsistent all star I've ever seen with his talent and potential.   Bucks wont win with him, a non scoring point guard, and role players like Tucker and Lopez. They have to find a way to add talent, change things up or else face the same fate as the last few years....a solid contender that can't get over the hump with a top 5 superstar. Sooner or later they'll blow it up and Giannis will probably win a ring with Steph and Klay."
Jrue Middleton and Khris Holladay really let Giannis Igottabumtoe down tonight.
"He has Jrue fucking Holiday and Khris Middleton. That‚Äôs better than 80% of NBA teams 2nd and third options. Hell, Middleton dropped 40% on 3‚Äôs averaging 30 points the last three games prior to today.  People are acting like Giannis is playing with Sacramento out there. Is it better than Phoenix‚Äôs lineup? No, but it‚Äôs not some poverty level roster."
"Bruh, his last year when he's 35 he has a 37million option. Like, wtf?!? I was livid when the Pels were paying him 25 mil for this inconsistent nonsense as someone in their late 20s. 37mil for a 35 year old putting up 15/6/6?!?!?!? Ahahahahahahahha but, mumble mumble something about defense. Last time I checked he hasn't stopped anyone from scoring since Dame in 2018. Book had 31,CP had 23, and Bridges had 27....I guess he shut down Khris Middleton.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

"Who on the Bucks roster could check Paul or Booker? Tucker did. With Donte hurt, it‚Äôs him Jrue, and Khris. That‚Äôs all we‚Äôve got. Bud can‚Äôt teach Teague or Pat to play better defense than they are physically capable of.  We have three guys at or near the max, with Giannis on a massive supermax. When you build a team that way, especially when you aren‚Äôt a team where guys will sign to ring chase, your stars have to carry you.   Jrue and Middleton shit the bed. We were outplayed, full stop. This is about the last game where you should be saying we were outcoached."
"khris middleton and jrue holiday were out today, if they play by next game the bucks have a chance still"
