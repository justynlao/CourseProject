Taj Gibson
Taj Gibson in his prime was a *beast* id def have him in my lineup
We traded Taj Gibson for that pile of poop. Made me sad.
Should the Knicks keep Taj Gibson now that we won a game and are contending for the next decade?
"Yeah, young Austin Rivers, Randle, Payton, Burks, Bullock and Taj Gibson."
"This was so entertaining but frustrating cuz the clippers made so many fucking 3s and the Knicks were only down 2 points in the 4th at one point. Thibs played crummy rotations with Taj Gibson (mans needs to stay as a bench coach, that’s it) wayyy too long, and should’ve rotated better. Knicks got 3 guys that can be 20 PPG scorers and they’re not even big time super stars. Randle is an all star, IQ ROY, RJ shutting the haters up. I’m just so glad we’re competitive."
"**u/dynamo3g's KNICKS POST GAME THREAD #2**  -----------  -Quickley is still fucking ridiculous. 25 points and he looked DYNAMIC on the court. He had a few bad defensive rotations but he is a rookie and he STILL looked better than Elfrid defensively. His floater is legitimately automatic and it's so fun to have a player with a true signature move. PLEASE START HIM NEXT GAME.   -We gave up WAYYYYYYY too many threes and it cost us the game. Clippers couldn't miss on open looks.   -Taj Gibson is awesome to have. He seems to always come down with 50/50 rebounds and is a true enforcer/glue player on the inside. Happy to see him on this Knicks team reunited with Thibs.   -RJ and Randle have both taken ridiculous steps forward this year under Thibs and they both played great today. Obi looks fine? I feel like if we threw him more lobs he could convert most of them, he was open on the cut on a lot of plays and Elfrid/Burks/Rivers didn't really look his way.   GG CLIPPERS HAVE FUN IN THE FINALS THIS YEAR"
Taj Gibson sighting?
"It didn't amount to anything because Thibs pushed the chips all in about 5 years too early. (Maybe it doesn't amount to anything either way, but Thibs didn't give it the chance to)  In a single offseason, we went from the young, scary Wolves to one of the oldest teams in the league by swapping Dunn and Lavine for Butler, and signing Jeff Teague, Taj Gibson, and Jamal Crawford.  Thibs took over a young, rebuilding team and immediately mortgaged the future for one playoff berth. His moves as GM are a huge reason we're as horrible as we are now."
"Even if Rose won MVP, It doesn't necessarily make him the better player. People love to overrate collections of stars and underrate well built teams which Chicago was.  Joakim Noah was a decent playmaker from the 5 (eventually became elite), maybe he doesn't score but it doesnt make him a bad offensive player. Luol Deng for the talent in 2011 is a pretty solid second scoring option. He had a versatile game, could score on/off ball hit midrange and the 3. Carlos Boozer was a money midrange shooter and very capable low post presence for the team. This is a guy who was averaging 20 points per game on Utah before coming to Chicago. Plus Kyle Korver and Taj Gibson.  Chicago won 60 games because they were a damn good team. Rose was by far the most important offensive player but he did not carry the entire Chicago Offense.   Dirk, Kobe, Lebron, Wade were all unquestionably better than Rose. I think Dwight and KD were also. And then as soon as the very next year, CP3 came in and proved he was still the best point guard in the league (he was coming off injury in 2011)"
the taj gibson era begins today
"No matter which guys they had out there. They were gonna play hard. They could’ve been missing 4 starters, starting Keith Bogans, Nate Robinson, Joakim Noah, Ronnie Brewer and Taj Gibson but damn it they were gonna play as if they were the original al starting 5"
"I mean, the Knicks have the top 2 players in total minutes played and Taj Gibson soooooooo"
"ok and taj gibson was a very capable fill in for boozer and noah. That was a very deep team. people forget that cj watson, bogans, gibson were all good players."
"I'm on the opposite end, it's clear that the magic had a better team around Dwight, they were the best shooting team in the league and he had pretty consistent offensive help. Rose's team was missing 2 starters most of the season Noah and boozer. The replacements kurt thomas and 2md year taj gibson would probably not crack the magic rotation neither would Keith bogans.   Let's not continue though this is just a circle and were not going to convince the other."
"Vince carter , Jameer Nelson, Hedo Turkeglo, Jason Richardson, and Rashard lewis, JJ reddick, brandon bass werent bad carter, turkeglo were probably werent too far off from deng and Noah   The magic had way more depth than the bulls and by far had the most players average double digit points that year. Most of 2011 was Deng and Rose the bulls started Kurt Thomas, keith bogans and Taj Gibson most of the year."
Taj Gibson
"We are literally talking about advantages of Westbrook taking the ball and how it generates fastbreak points.  You really think EVERY transition happens the same way? You're whole argument is banking in on ONE TYPE of fastbreak. Like no shit Westbrook can out run all defenders, but you also know another effective transition offense? Westbrook taking the ball up.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Nz6q7D2Ls&amp;ab_channel=zhugelianges  Literally just watch this compilation and see the type of looks they generate from Westbrook.  You have Westbrook bringing the ball up to take advantage of defences not being set.  WB catching the ball off an outlet pass.  Taj Gibson getting a mismatch due to WB having 5 defenders confused on who has ball (at 2:12).  Having WB take the ball up is another weapon where they can generate fastbreak points.  &gt; But its not just that. Being able to take advantage of defences not set up, off-balance defenders and mismatches happens when WB takes it up during a transition. &gt; The outlet pass to DRose literally made it so he took advantage of defences not set up, off-balance/mispositioned defenders and mismatches. What are you talking about at this point  You ever try to defend a fastbreak vs a faster guy? Its stuff like [this](https://youtu.be/x7Nz6q7D2Ls?t=201) when a guy is coming downhill so you cant really set your feet and stay in front.  I know you seem to hate Westbrook but damn man, its just simple basketball concepts. Its really not hard to grasp."
"Kevin Love, Beasley, Tyus Jones, Dieng, Taj Gibson, Teague... there’s a lot of examples of this being not really true"
Taj Gibson lol
"Actually isn't Taj Gibson 67 for NYK?  I looked at the bkref page earlier for #67 and it didn't show him for this season (so that page must be out of date)  edit: oh duh, because he hasn't yet played a game since signing!"
"Nah, we got to wait and see if elfrid payton is finally going to ascend to superstardom lol  I'm surprised thibs isn't starting Taj gibson at point guard"
"Old Man Toppin lol. He’s 22. Paul Milsap was 24 when drafted, Rodman was 25, Taj Gibson was 24 as well. All 3 had good long careers and still developed enormously upon entering the league.   Don’t get me wrong, I understand drafting younger allows for more growth time, but it’s certainly not the end all be all. By what we’ve seen I’d take Toppin and his age over Hayes and his 27% shooting."
"Lol, basketball isn't anime.  Taj gibson grunting at Anthony edwards won't make him become a respectable shooter.  It won't make D'Angelo Russell not the slowest guard in the league, it won't make Jarrett Culver show any sort of offensive skillset"
"He was put in a position to fail. Thibs wanted to trade Wiggins for Butler, but Glen Taylor wouldn't allow it. He brought in a lot of great players like Butler, Taj Gibson, and DRose."
Seems like the Knicks lack a true veteran leader. I guess Taj Gibson is around somewhere?
Kirk Hinrich and Taj Gibson for the Bulls. Gerald Green was always spectacular especially that first year with the Suns. He had about 45 or 50 dunk contest moves in game that season.
"He had to stand on the perimeter because Steve, Taj Gibson, Grant, and Kanter were all playing center, not because russ said “hey stand on the peremiter so I can hold the ball for 22 seconds”"
"In addition to buy-out candidates, there are also players who have 'retired' or are more or less sitting out the season for the time being. Someone like Taj Gibson met that criteria until he signed with the Knicks last week. I can imagine some vets who want to play eventually, but also not wanting to deal with a full season of COVID protocols. So for the time being, they are spending this time at home with their families or whatever to stay in shape."
"All you gotta do to see this isn't true is look through the wolves subreddit. He ain't been treated well on there since the first ten games of the 17-18 season.   He had the misfortune to be a rookie on a team that couldn't make the playoffs with a guy averaging 26/12/4 on the team. They had the worst defense in the league his rookie year and started a horde of players that would be out of the league within a few years. Next year they nearly doubled their wins with KAT despite playing with Tayshaun Prince starting 44 games and not averaging 3 points in 19 minutes per game. The next year they only tack on two more wins but in context that's not bad considering Lavine had a season ending injury about 2/3rds of the way into the season and they had to start the corpse of Brandon Rush while letting Bazz soak up the biggest portion of bench minutes IN AN 8 MAN ROTATION WITH WIGGINS, KAT, AND LAVINE ALL BEING IN THE TOP 10 FOR MPG AND KAT AND WIGGINS BEING TOP TWO IN TOTAL MINUTES. Then Butler comes along, he becomes third option and borderline 4th for a while until Teague and Butler manage to get injured for a long portion of the season and Butler still singlehandedly gets all the credit for making the playoffs in a season that he missed a 4th of while the team had almost no depth and had to play terrible rotations for because the team couldn't afford a bench and Butler... and Teague? And Taj Gibson? But no. It's on Wiggins that a team with no depth and an incompetent front office and injury problems only made the 8th seed by the skin of their teeth.   Like damn. What more did this guy have to do for the franchise? Put LeBron in his place and the wolves still probably miss the playoffs 3/5 seasons that he was with them. Maybe 4/5. And that's just the playoffs. No title contention for sure.   The biggest problem with the wolves franchise in recent history has been its lack of ability to hit in the draft outside of Wiggins, Towns, and Lavine and if combine that with their terrible free agent signings, what can you expect?   It's only been two years since he was booed at a home game during free throws. There are plenty of fans ready to point out they never liked Wiggins in every thread. There have been negative posts about Wiggins in weekly basis for years. That's not a supportive fan base."
"Picking up the odd interior big man for a vet min is not that hard in the NBA. Knicks just picked up Taj Gibson the other day, I guess he was just waiting for an opportunity. Nets are going to find someone soon enough, some other team is going to underachieve and cut some decent bench pieces to try and save salary"
Greatest chess move this week was the Knicks signing Taj Gibson so that the Nets couldn't get him.
Thibodeau and Taj Gibson?
Taj Gibson. Dude played for us for half a season during Russ’s MVP season and I’ve liked him ever since.  Seems like a genuinely nice guy and seemed like he wanted to stay with us just couldn’t get the money he wanted.

Taj Gibson
We were apparently between picking up Taj Gibson or Tyson Chandler last week before going with Taj.  I didn't know Tyson was even still an option to pick up.
"He played that way next to Jimmy Butler, Taj Gibson, and KG. You can say a lot of things about those guys, but ""not trying on D"" isn't one of them."
the knicks are 0-2 with taj gibson back smh the curse of last season
"LOL. Also Ibaka, Reggie Jackson, and Patrick Patterson  Now that most players from past OKC teams Wiggins played against have dispersed across the league, I hope he thinks he's playing against OKC every time he sees a former OKC player on the opposing team:  * Blazers (Melo, Kanter) - current split 1-1  * Pistons (Grant) - 1-0 so far (do we play Eastern conference teams 1 more time in 2nd half of season?)  * Kings (Corey Brewer) - 1-0 so far  * Pelicans (Steven Adams)  * Wizards (Westbrook)   * Nuggets (PJ Dozier)  * Sixers (Terrance Ferguson)  * Pacers (Oladipo, Sabonis, McDermott)  * Suns (Cam Payne, CP3)  * Lakers (Schröder, Markieff Morris)  * Nets (Luwawu-Cabarott, KD) - 0-1 so far  * Knicks (Noel, Taj Gibson if they sign him)  * Bucks (DJ Augustin) - 0-1 so far"
Isn't Taj Gibson really washed at this point in his career? I know he's a Thibs guy but me personally I would try a G Leaguer who can bring more energy to the team.
"&gt; It appears that Taj graduated high school in 2006 when he was almost 21.  I'm not real sharp on prep schools so I stand to be corrected but I think they can sometimes serve as a middle-ground between high school and college, particularly if additional credit is needed for college eligibility. Seems like the home school credits didn't all carry over so he needed to layover time in prep school.   Still a crazy fact though (the age thing).   In most states, I don't think you can still be in public high school by age 20 or 21, so prep would likely be his only option to get things in line for college.   &gt;His parents and coaches thought he would be better off at a prep school in California so he transferred to Tarzana Stoneridge Prep. Gibson was tall, at 6 feet 9 inches, but lacked bulk on his frame.  &gt;""He was very frail, probably not physical enough to play in the Pac-10,"" Johnson said.  &gt;Gibson played another year at Calvary Christian before he reached USC -- and he almost didn't reach USC. His grades from home schooling, he learned, did not meet NCAA standards.  &gt;So Gibson took online and correspondence courses at Brigham Young over the summer, qualified academically and was declared eligible for the 2006-07 season. He still had improvements to make.  Thanks for sharing though. Had no idea."
Taj Gibson was one of the college players that I thought would be a star in the NBA. He didn't find a team that fit/developed him.
I took a Disney cruise once. Taj Gibson and his family was assigned the table one over for nightly dinner. End story.
Popovich running meme when Thibs found out that Taj Gibson was a free agent
"on the floor for OKC:  Westbrook, Oladipo, Robertson, Taj Gibson, Adams.  lol what the fuck kind of spacing is this and they're still up by double digits. Westbrook deserved that MVP idgaf what reddit thinks."
"Not many rooks, even guys who stay 4 years in college, have the skill to come in and make above replacement level impact on a winning / contending team. Most talented guys that struggled their frosh season make their leap 2nd season and enter draft then. PP improved a bit as a soph then his numbers and efficiency actually regressed a junior before blowing up as a senior.  4 year guys becoming good role players in general let alone as a rook are even rarer than 2 year guys... since Lillard key names are:  Draymond Green, CJ McCollum, JJ Reddick, Jeremy Lin, Larry Nance Jr, Buddy Hield, Malcolm Brogdon, Denzel Valentine, all 3 Plumlee Brothers 2 of the Zeller brothers (not Cody) Taj Gibson   And technically Jimmy Butler. Probably forgetting a few but none better than Hield/Brogdon. That's clearly much less than 2nd year guys."
You should get Taj Gibson
Taj Gibson so I could knock Trae on his ass when he comes into the paint
"Played together at USC, but tbf Vooch was cheeks and DeRozan was raw   Edit: they also played with TAJ Gibson lol"
"Actually you know what... we’ll give you Alec burks, taj gibson, Obi toppin and Derrick Rose for Jamal Murray... deal?"
"We’re in agreement that Marvin eats best when someone is setting him up, rather than when he tries creating for himself.  Or when he scores off a broken play or an offensive rebound or something.  (Side note: Haliburton running the P&amp;R with ANY big dramatically improves that big’s game).    It’s okay that Marvin can’t hoop on Taj Gibson yet.  As long as he keeps improving, and adds value to the team in other ways for the meantime.    Amen to your suggestion that any self-respecting big needs to box tf out"
"The good: respectable 3 point shooters, pretty good at second chance point, great dunker  The Bad: still a horrible defender (he is really bad), can’t creat his own shot (can’t even post up/ score on Taj Gibson, doesn’t really box out  His stats maybe ok but it really misleading, he is nowhere near that good."
"Taj Gibson, who is somehow still in the league, qualifies here. He was a PF with the Bulls but is a C for the Knicks these days"
Fucking bullshit it should have been Taj Gibson!  Am i doing it right?
"I'm sorry Kings fans. You don't deserve Luke Walton and your defense. But on the bright side, you have a nice young core, and it's not impossible to make it out of the basement. If we can get it done, so can you.  From our side, we played very well. No one had a bad game. I've really grown to like Taj Gibson, very reliable player and good for team chemistry."
Even taj Gibson made a three. Obi’s ny home team feels glitter dust is fading
"Walton literally assigned Cojo to guard TAJ GIBSON. Cory Joseph is like 6'1"" and was barely able to keep up with Taj Gibson while running."
U better watch out for Embiid Stopper Taj Gibson
Imagine getting a three dropped on you by Taj Gibson
YERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR  Some thoughts:  Taj Gibson is actually amazing and has so much motor and drive when he plays. He dives for loose balls like a fiend.  Theo Pinson is such a good culture guy and watching him pick up our BOYS off the court when they fell down was awesome.  Immanuel Quickley should still be in ROTY contention. He's so good.   Frank is so good and the box score doesn't show it.  WILL THE KNICKS FINALLY GET BACK TO .500? FIND OUT NEXT TIME!
TAJ GIBSON HITS A 3?????

Why did Taj fucking Gibson play the entire fourth?
Taj Gibson
yeah maybe he’s not just good he has had so many elite teammates like Treveon Graham Jeff Teague josh okogie Juancho Hernangomez Taj Gibson Jake Layman and more.
"Part of that is just how wildly inexperienced the team is.  A dude who averages 30 minutes a game and plays all 82 games would total 2460 minutes in an NBA season. Two such seasons would amount to 4920 minutes. In yesterday’s game, 7 of the Wolves top 9 minutes-getters have fewer minutes than that number. They consistently do not execute down the stretch. Turnovers, mixed up defensive coverages, silly fouls, etc. And it’s been that way for most of the season. Just compare who the Wolves had on the floor at the end of the game to the Knicks: Derrick Rose/Alec Burks — Reggie Bullock — RJ Barrett — Julius Randle — Taj Gibson. All but Barrett have eclipsed 5000 NBA minutes (most have doubled or tripled it). That experience really helps, especially when the game tightens up and execution errors are killers."
"It would help but our bench lineup would be the worst offensive unit ever. 4 players that can’t shoot, one average shooter, a center who can’t score inside, shoot threes or even hit free throws (taj Gibson is our backup cuz Mitch is out) I think what we would benifit most from pulling together a trade that gets us a nice catch and shooter for our team to replace reggie bullock"
taj gibson Twolves Hero
trade for Taj Gibson guaranteed chip
No. Taj Gibson was MVP in 2021
The man you should really be thanking is Taj Gibson
Funny thing is he's already played in LA for USC. Played there with DeMar and Taj Gibson.
KAT was laughing with Taj Gibson after he missed the go ahead shot...
Always rated Taj “defensive powerhouse” Gibson
"This is how I remember it as well.   It wasn't necessarily Randle, it was ""Do you need Julius Randle, Taj Gibson, Marcus Morris, Bobby Portis, and Mitchell Robinson on one team? Where are all the minutes going to come from when they're all healthy?""  In retrospect it makes a lot more sense if you know that you're going to trade Morris and/or Bobby Portis.  Yeah they overpaid for both, but in doing so, the knicks put themselves in a position where there was no long term implications.  Overall it was a pretty low-risk move."
"Thad Young seems like the perfect Iguodala/Taj Gibson profile of guy who will not be close to win 6th man of the year despite being by far the most valuable bench player in the league, can't wait for that award to be renamed ""most ppg off the bench award"""
How about Taj Gibson (CHI) on DWade? Wade would go up for EVERYTHING.
"Taj Gibson, Doug McDermott and a second-round pick to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Cameron Payne, Anthony Morrow and Joffrey Lauvergne  Maybe not the worst but I still don't understand it"
"I DIDNT COME FOR THE MASSAGE,  FUNK. I CAME FOR THE FACIAL!     -Stacey King calling a Taj Gibson dunk"
Taj gibson dunk on d wade was smoother.
We wouldn’t want him taking Taj Gibson minutes now would we.

This team upset they missed out on the Taj Gibson sweepstakes.
"Seriously, I swear the last time I heard about Taj Gibson was like 3-4 years ago. Was surprised to see him in a highlight lol."
Taj Gibson is still in the league??
"It depends, how do you feel about taj gibson?"
"I see your point. I'm down voted for speaking facts which is what I also get on the hawks subreddit when I question trae. But by the letter of the law, this play is a foul. Gibson jumps instead of just running into him so if you don't understand the rule, you think it's a foul but that doesn't change the outcome. Trae got their first, Taj tried to jump so he had a chance to get the call but the ref called it like it supposed to be called according to the rule.   You can dislike the call, you can dislike the rule. I am NOT a trae young fan even though I am a huge hawks fan but this is a foul. Down vote me all you want, I won't delete my comments."
Am i crazy or was there a point where people thought Taj Gibson was gonna be huge after Boozer left?
"Just saying the guy is ""unwatchable"" is just dumb man. I'm a hawks fan and I've always questioned trae but to say he is unwatchable is just ridiculous. The guy is unbelievably exciting with the high level passing and crazy range. Even here, he beats Taj to the spot and Gibson just jumps to try and make up for trae getting their first. You don't have to like it, but it is a foul. Trae didn't flop, he literally got their first and was fouled. Complain about the rule, not the player."
I liked him but mostly ironically. Like Taj Gibson levels of fandom.   Now it’s fully unironic.
Taj Gibson needs to be drawn and quartered for this disgusting act.
"Not gonna pile on, the game is the game so Young drawing fouls doesn't bother me but the one on Rose and the one on Taj Gibson were just downright bad."
He had a pretty egregious flop on Taj Gibson for his 4th foul
Alright chill out. And nah he has turned it up a notch this year. I think he benefits from his size. Like the Taj Gibson foul would probably be offensive if it was Giannis but since Trae is so small he just bounces off of anyone anytime he initiates contact.
Nah I still can't believe that foul on Taj Gibson. Like why even play defense then.
"&gt; But hey we talk about an award that Jamal Crawford won over Andre Iguodala and Taj Gibson,   Funny thing about this was that everyone on r/nba was stunned when he won it at the time. The sub was polled prior to award voting and he finished [5th.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4fim5i/official_rnba_power_rankers_2016_award_votes/)"
Nah nah Taj Gibson for Brown and Tatum
"I think Clarkson will win it, I also would like one day, that the 6MOY award becomes something other than the ""scorer of the bench who can't do anything else"" award, because there are a lot of better bench players that just never even get votes because they don't score like that but that any contender would want over the ""one dimensional gunner on average efficiency"" type.  But hey we talk about an award that Jamal Crawford won over Andre Iguodala and Taj Gibson, so I can't complain about Clarkson because he's at least good"
Would ruin the Taj Gibson era at the Garden
They need a real center like taj Gibson
Are there some more bald players in the league rn? I can only remember taj Gibson
Taj Gibson time
"They should have been drafting around the top 5 for the last 3-4 years. Cleared up cap space and went after decent free agents while guys like Porzingis were on rookie deals.      I don't get why they went out and signed THJ or used the cap space from the Porzingis trade to get Julius Randle, Taj Gibson, Elfrid Payton, Bobby Portis, and Marcus Morris. That's 4 older, mediocre, low ceiling PFs, when their 2 best young players at the time were Kevin Knox and Mitchell Robinson."
"Nobody would confuse KAT with a defensive anchor, he isn’t Gobert. I would disagree with the idea that he’s never been a quality defender (admittedly not what you said), though, since he was actually a decent defender as a rookie with Kevin Garnett in his ear and a passable defender under Thibs.   Just to reiterate my point, though, Jokic and Murray have proven that you don’t have to be an elite individual defender to lead a top 10 defense. Just to go on a slight tangent — I’m a lifelong fan of the Bulls. Back in 2010-2012, their rotation included Boozer and Korver (and fringe guys like Nate Robinson, John Lucas, etc...) and they still always managed to have an elite defense because of the system Thibs put around them. And while they had Luol Deng, Joakim, and Taj Gibson to pick up the slack, they really didn’t have a cast of all elite defender. Just a team of guys who knew the system.   I’m not attacking the Nuggets or the greatness of Jokic by saying that the Nuggets have a great system. KAT needs that system the same way that any winning team needs that system, and the current organization around KAT is garbage."
"Having big numbers != extremely good. What he did was super impressive, but his supporting staff wasn't as terrible as WB stans would have you believe. Andre Robertson was a lockdown defender, Steven Adams was a high-quality big man, Kanter was, well, Kanter (that's a whole 'nother discussion), Taj Gibson was still decent, Oladipo, Sabonis, and Grant were all not as good as they came to be, obviously, but still gave them something (and all three really got better once separated from Westbrook IMHO but I won't make that part of my argument). How could we forget Thunder GOAT Nick Collison? But really, that's a pretty mediocre roster, sure, but not exactly the 2011-12 Bobcats like some would have you believe. Russ had an amazing season but he didn't deserve the MVP. That should have gone to Harden or even Kawhi, in my opinion. Westbrook was just not on their level. He was close, but it surprised nobody when he flamed out in the playoffs against Harden and the Rockets, who by the way, did not have a wildly better supporting cast (although now that I look at it, D'antoni is a far, far better coach than Donovan so I could surrender that point).  The fact is that everyone knew that Westbrook wasn't in the same tier as the best players, but they gave him the MVP because of the triple doubles and all the amazing things he did that year. That's fine, but I'm not going to pretend that he was actually ever a truly elite, all-time talent at any point in his career."
derrick rose &amp; taj gibson
"Because he’s a 6’4 20 year old with a 7’1 wingspan who can shoot, dribble, pass, and defend. Oh and also because Kuzma was paid 13 million...  I mean shit if Taj Gibson, Trevor Ariza, Bobby Portis, Thaddeus Young, Maxi Kleber, Aminu, Corey Joesph, etc got paid 9-10+ million then THT definitely will..."
Bruh how do you not know who Kevin Willis is?   He’s basically the Taj Gibson of his era
"I mean Grant, Adams, Oladipo, Kanter, Roberson, Sabonis, Taj Gibson, Doug McDermott.   Thats not exactly an all star team but those are all strong role players."
"You can't be serious lmao, Sabonis was a rookie who averaged 6ppg that year who by the end of the year was benched in favor of a declining Taj Gibson and Steven Adams that year scored over 10ppg for the first time in his career with a scorching 11. Oladipo was decent offensively coming in but was at best a good role player not a second star yet. Like Enes Kanter took the third most shots that year, literally no one considers a team decent when Enes Kanter is getting that many shots.   Like if you didn't watch them play that year just say that, nobody at the time was considering Sabonis a key contributor or Steven Adams as more than an okay starter. The team looking back has some good names on it but that was way before they developed the games that they have today"
Taj Gibson &amp; Thaddeus young
My yearly reminder that taj Gibson is still in the league
"Taj  ""Despite the loss"" Gibson with the 1/4/1/2/1 statline and +15 in 20 mins"
Taj Gibson...now that is a name I have not heard in a long time
It’s cruel to do that to a senior citizen like Taj Gibson.
Woah. You really gonna defend taj Gibson like he's your lebron?
That boy just gave Taj Gibson a facial!!
Having 50 year old Taj Gibson as your last line of defense is like a 2020 Knicks thing and not a 2021 Knicks thing imo
Just a friendly (salty) reminder that Thomas Joseph Thibodeau chose to draft center Justin Patton with Karl Anthony Towns and Gorgui Dieng under contract (then signed Taj Gibson to a 2/$28m contract less than 2 weeks later) over guys like John Collins and **OG Anunoby**.
Taj Gibson
2009:  Steph Curry  James Harden  Demar DeRozan  Blake Griffin  Taj Gibson  6th man: Jrue Holiday
"In 2018, Denver and Minnesota played their last game. Whoever wins goes to the playoffs. Literally 10 fouls over Jokic. Refs swallowed the whistle while they gave many fouls for Butler. Even the last attack Taj Gibson hits Jokic on the arm and the refs don't react. He has had that treatment for literally his entire career."
Eh. We’re playing taj Gibson heavy minutes right now we needed a big
"He recently had an interview where he talked about how he is trying to fill more of a Taj Gibson, dirty work, type of rope for the team to win. And my only thought was, if KAT feels the need to be Taj Gibson in order to help the team win, we have already lost."
"Yeah I don't know why I even bother, Jamal Crawford won that award over Andre Iguodala and Taj Gibson, that's all that has to be said about this ""award"""
God fucking damnit Powell how do you lose TAJ GIBSON
KP is gonna see Taj Gibson in his nightmares.
How old is Taj Gibson
I feel like we got robbed in that game i remember Taj Gibson beating shit of Jokic and not fouling out..but thats nothing new when defending Jokic . Still that gave us some key picks like MPJ and motivation to keep moving forward
The secret is pretty much out that you can push Jokic around and they’ll never call anything. Still mad At what Taj Gibson got away with on the Wolves a few years ago keeping us out of the playoffs.
"Taj Gibson and Doug McDermott for Cam Payne, Joffrey (idk how to spell his name) and Anthony Morrow. Cam Payne was the only one who stayed on the team past that season. Taj was great in his role and would’ve been a great veteran presence in the rebuild but GarPax didn’t wanna pay him *checks notes* 2 yrs/$28M. Before people say that’s a lot for Taj Gibson. The Bulls were rebuilding and never took on a bad contract during those tanks years."
Gotta go back 7 years for context but the Bulls traded picks that became Gary Harris and Jusuf Nurkic to draft Doug McDermott then traded Doug McDermott and Taj Gibson for Cameron Payne.
Taj Gibson has these boys in HELL
Bro. He made the playoffs with Andre Roberson next to him. Don’t gimme that. I know the lineup sucks but two stars can only get you 17 wins this year? What a joke. How many stars do the Knicks have or the Spurs because they are winning basketball games and aren’t super deep either. Put taj Gibson on the wizards doesn’t move the needle but I’m the Knicks he gets playing time??!! Lol and they win? Russ not a winning player he washed end of story
I think he meant superstar vets not vets like Taj Gibson.
Can somebody please leave us a fuckin Center? Taj Gibson can’t take much more of this shit.
"During our one playoff series in past millennium 40 percent our offense was Jeff Teague/Taj Gibson pick and rolls, Completely leaving KAT and Jimmy out on the sidelines. It was infuriating."
"Sure, but they were at Atlanta Hawks esque team with less talent, they didn’t have a 17 PPG scorer no all stars. They were well coached and had a great home court but damn man you have to admit they had a lack of talent I mean Ty Lawson, Andre Miller, and Kenneth Farried were all in the top five for minutes.  Also look at Russ lineup Oladipo, Roberson, Adams, Taj Gibson he’s literally the only offensive threat like none of those guys can shoot"
35 year old taj Gibson could only do so much
It's actually Taj Gibson
"Taj Gibson is still playing ball in this league, come-on man."
As a kid who grew up in Chicago with USC alum parents... I'm intensely into it. I thought I'd peaked with Taj Gibson.
This isn’t fair man. Smh. Hate it for Mitch and idk how we’re supposed to make the playoffs with Taj Gibson and Nerlens Noel at center.
Man we really have to try and make a playoff push with Taj Gibson and Nerlens Noel at the 5.
Taj Gibson starting at PF over Obi
I'm still in disbelief that I watched Taj Gibson score double digit points in the Year of Our Lord 2021.
"Right now, I think Obi Toppin's not being used properly for the Knicks.      For someone athletic as Obi Toppin is, he's not really rolling to the rim that often. Instead, you'll see Thibs put Taj Gibson and Obi Toppin in a double ball screen at the top of the key, where Gibson rolls to the rim and Toppin spaces to the top of the key. This is in direct contrast with his advertised college skills, where he was an athletic lob finisher and often played as the big making the handoff to a sprinting guard and slipping in for athletic finishes.      Either you see him running that play with some random guard, or you'll see Obi Toppin spacing in the corner, where he's been absolutely horrid this season. Pretty much at all times, he's riding around the 3 point line. In my opinion, this makes him absolutely useless, as Obi Toppin wasn't advertised as a capable 3 point shooter coming out of college. In fact, it was his most questionable skill(outside of his lateral agility/perimeter defense). He shot well from 3 for Dayton, but on limited opportunities.      Yeah he's been bad this season, but I honestly think that Toppin's being used insanely poorly right now. He's never near the rim, neutralizing his athletic gifts. He can't finish without a good ball handler/passer feeding him(surprise, we don't have any great ball handlers/passers this season; maybe Derrick Rose, but IQ and RJ and Payton aren't great), and not being near the rim removes any ability for him to get putback dunks with his athleticism. If Thibs drew up some plays for Toppin where we just run the 2 man game at the top of the key, with a spaced floor, I bet Toppin would be better. But right now, nah he really sucks."
I cannot believe that I am watching Taj Gibson score on the Sixers in the year 2021.
"Ive always wondered that too given the proximity to talent, strong school branding, and located in a major city. We were starting to get better in the mid 00s (Demar, Vucevic, Taj Gibson, Nick Young, others) but the sanctions set us back for a while in both football and basketball.   We're getting better the last couple years. About to have a top lottery pick two years in a row with Okongwu last yr and now Evan Mobley. Hopefully this trend attracts more top recruits who want to be one and done like Calipari has done for the last decade. Im not a big fan of Enfield as a coach, but he can recruit for sure."
Taj Gibson is still in the league? WHAT?
Its been proven to work out excellent on the court. Except instead of Taj gibson at PF now you get Bam.  And no Wiggins chucking up bricks.   Long as they can make amends  i dont see why not
"This was never supposed to be close, especially with our only playable bench player being Taj Gibson. Proud of the way they competed to make this a game. GG"
Taj Gibson*
"In no particular order Zion, Kawhi, Lebron, Taj Gibson, Steven Adams."
Rose-Taj Gibson-Collins-Randle-Mitchell   closer lineup.... just how Tibs likes it
I'm not sure if I never knew or if I just completely forgot that Vucevic played in the NCAA (for 3 years at that). He even played with DeRozan and Taj Gibson.
https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/bulls/ct-xpm-2013-12-23-chi-chicago-bulls-taj-gibson-flopping-20131223-story.html damn that's crazy
God the fouling the refs let Taj Gibson get away with while he was guarding Jokic is the fourth quarter and overtimes of that game was just absolutely ridiculous lol. Angers me to even remember it
Jokic goes super hard every time we play against Taj Gibson or KAT lmao
"Yeah it definitely started shifting a few years ago, but I just remember getting absolutely shit on for even trying to put them in the same conversation when they were rookies lol, back when people thought Jokic was just an advanced stat mirage. Seems like Jokic might remember too with how he always goes crazy vs KAT and Taj Gibson"
Jokic place with a sense of vengeance whenever he plays KAT/Taj Gibson
"Shoutout to Taj Gibson. Brought back as a mentor / 3rd-string big, and played pretty well when he's on court."
"I dont know man, Knickola Jokic should head down to New York to play with his lifelong mentor Taj Gibson."
"It was almost good, but RJ barrett missed Taj Gibson cutting"
Taj Gibson.
"I mean I dunno what his options were but hornets and Knicks would’ve ideal. Like I know Drummond is better than Bismack and if Drummond can’t outplay Taj Gibson, he’s a lost cause. It’s possible that he didn’t have any suitors but I just look at the lakers like Gasol is easily their best center. Gasol is in all their best lineups and a lot of the criticism he was receiving was unfounded. Lakers struggles were really when brow and Harrell played together. I just think Drummond Harrell is a wash on D and Harrell is a much better offensive player. Then you have to factor in Brow playing center.   Nice player to have while you’re short handed but there was like zero chance of Drummond breaking into the playoff roto unless something real bad happens."
"Nerlens Noel went from being a potential overpay to one of the more underrated centers in the league. Great for his PR, bad for his wallet.  Also I'm convinced that Thibs will turn Taj Gibson into NYK's version of Udonis Haslem."
Taj Gibson
"Lol you can stop throwing around false narratives now pal. Taj Gibson and DRose love Thibs and still play their hardest for him 10 years later. Taj is 35, has been playing for Thibs his entire career and is still gladly playing 25+ mins a game this year and contributing at a high level. DRose is playing his best basketball since he was on the Wolves with, guess who, Tom Thibodeau.   Nice ""shortened career"" theory you got there"
He stood in a precarious position beneath Taj Gibson as well. Which is why Gibson erupted at him with the elbow after.
"I have explained this to you several fucking times. Since you're mentally incapable of comprehending the simplest of concepts, I'll give you a video example:  https://youtu.be/LSzzx3LvUvU  What Chris Paul did to Taj Gibson is called boxing out. What Taj Gibson got called for is called ramming, and it is what Colin Sexton did tonight. The only difference is, the sizes are reversed. So instead of going flying, Luka moved a few inches."
I love what y’all are doing with this roster. You weren’t gifted with superstars like frank Ntilikina and Taj Gibson but through hard work you’ve managed to catch up to us. That’s that mamba mentality if u ask me 💜💛💜💛
develop taj gibson?
"Chris Paul should have a decent shot at MVP this year but TAJ GIBSON is better.  And just to add, it’s amazing that Gibson is still playing at a high level but best 36 year old is a mighty stretch."
Taj Gibson violently shoves Chris Paul to the ground from behind and he's given a flagrant 1.   This shit is a flagrant two? Luka got shoved a little hard in the back and reacted. He deserved a flagrant 1 or a tech but to eject him? Officials just can't be consistent at all.
Taj Gibson and Derrick Rose are like the Thomas Jefferson and John Adams of the NBA.
Taj Gibson gets a one for trucking CP3 elbow first but THIS is an ejection? It was barely even a foul lol.
Taj Gibson with braids
"Went I grow up, I want to be Taj Gibson"
"based D Rose  Scoring aside, Randle tries really hard on defense    Taj Gibson contributing significantly to the Knicks season as a 35 year old and he's actually from Fort Greene Brooklyn is an awesome storyline  Knicks are the scrappiest of gym rats  i'm on the bandwagon for sure"
you’re gonna sit here and try to tell me taj mahal gibson isn’t the mvp?
Taj Gibson .... getting burn on a sleeper playoff team in 2021. This is wild. I love it.
I did not expect Taj Gibson to become a useful NBA player again in 2021. Was definitely not on my bingo card.
Also Thibs and Taj Gibson
D rose and taj Gibson on the floor together in 2021 is something else
They have the same problems as the spookywolves.  LaVine was constantly playing injured like Lonzo. Thibs kept playing LaVine at point and Rubio at SG just like SVG keeps playing Bledsoe. Rubio can't shoot 3s and Bledsoe can't play at all so both decisions are mindboggling. And in general both teams played really poor defense.  The solution is getting a defensive floor general. People don't really know how much of a gamechanger Taj Gibson was for KAT. For a minute it looked like KAT could actually play defense because Taj barked orders for 2 seasons and covered all the lapses. People acted like it was because Embiid called him out but actually it was a slow progression. Then Taj left and KAT reverted drastically.
Haha honestly he and Taj Gibson would have just made it that much better
"I wonder, since running up to someone and elbowing them is not a legal basketball play, if Chris Paul could realistically charge Taj Gibson with assault. It would obviously be the ultimate bitch move, but considering I got an assault charge in high school for spitting on someone's back, I think this would qualify right?"
"To be fair, CP3's box out made contact with Gibson when Taj was already in the air, so to Taj it may have felt more like being undercut than being boxed out."
"i googled taj gibson ejected to see what the result was and it came up with like 3 other instances where he got ejected for flagrants and ""dirty"" plays lmao"
UPDATE: Taj Gibson of the Knicks is currently being detained by the FBI due to his attempt to take Chris Paul’s life in a vicious and merciless manner
"Of all the people Taj Gibson had to piss off, he picked the absolute worst person lol"
"&gt;What are you even talking about lol  the extent to which you will go to defend an act such as this.  Although, in all seriousness, no hate against Taj Gibson. We all just poking fun because that foul does not look pleasant at all."
You're exactly right. Can't even blame Taj Gibson.   You know this is all on Thibbs. He's being exposed rn.   4K!!!!!
Alright calm down son it's just Taj Gibson lmao
"even taj gibson says chris paul is a ho, damn"
"[For those like me who didn't know what was going on, Varejao was out of the league since 2017 and signed a 10 day contract with the Cavs.](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31388543/anderson-varejao-nba-2017-signs-10-day-contract-cleveland-cavaliers)  I was really hoping my Bulls would pull a similar move with Joakim Noah this year, giving him a chance to reunite with his old college coach, while also providing a veteran leadership presence similar to Taj Gibson in New York this season, ultimately culminating in Noah retiring as a Bull."
"This game was Jokic going off against Taj Gibson for the 2018 game vs the wolves where they beat us to make the playoffs/Austin Rivers revenge game, you had too much going against you"
Taj Gibson is old AF
Where’s Taj Gibson?
1. Nerlens Noel  2. Taj Gibson  3.-5. irrelevant
Taj mother fucking Gibson.
Taj Gibson. Brings that hustle and muscle.
Taj Gibson and Bobby Portis were included in that too.
"The year is 2040. Thibs gets a new NBA head coaching job after a prolonged absence. 54 year old Taj Gibson, 51 year old D. Rose and 55 year old Joakim Noah all come out of retirement to play 42 MPG for thibs new team."
"I'd take Mitchell Robinson and Nerlens Noel over Andre Drummond. Hell, maybe even Taj Gibson too. Andre Drummond is REALLY bad."

Lol no it’s your name - reminds me of k fed for some reason. Not to mention you posted a shit ton when the incident happened. Like that stupid fuckin example showing Taj Gibson barely touching Lebron    And I remember it because I have fantastic memory - and your stupidity is pretty unforgettable
Taj Gibson :( (traded)
"Its not a dumb take at all, im a wolves fan, been watching them since 1997.  If it wasn't for winning that final game of the season in 2018 due to Taj gibson getting away with fouling Jokic, we'd be on a 16-season playoff drought.  There are not many things in life as predictable as the wolves missing the playoffs"
Taj Gibson is good
"The Bulls would have been far better off doing literally nothing in the past 5 years.   Honestly, their roster could have been Jimmy, Rose and Taj Gibson off the bench, and whatever draft picks they would have fallen into. That’s basically the ‘21 Knicks vet roster + Jimmy Butler + whatever picks developed. That team cracks the playoffs in the East easily with Thibs as the coach."
"Lmao what was KAT supposed to do with Jeff Teauge,Wiggins and Taj Gibson?"
Taj Gibson baybee
Taj Gibson is handsome and Nerlens Noel has an amazing smile.
Why the fuck do we want to verse the nuggets if Alex Len and Lopez and taj gibson and Dwight Powell and any random C in the league are cooking us?
The Knicks???? NO FUCKING WAY? Who’d they have Taj Gibson 😂😂😂😂
Taj Gibson
I saw Taj Gibson pull-off a spin move on Ben in the post. So he has been disqualified long time ago.
"A solid vet around a rebuild is someone like George Hill or Taj Gibson. Not a 30 year old All Star (borderline AS at that point) coming off 4 straight finals. He just averaged a nice 17 and 9. Nothing spectacular. If the price to keep him is 4 yrs/120mil - you let him walk and keep the cap flexibility.   I get why they did it (Love as option 1 might go back to 25 and 10 and turn into an awesome trade chip or lead to you the playoffs)  but at the time, a lot of people thought it was a bad gamble. They've doubled and tripled down on it by not trading him - making the initial decision worse."
7. Taj Gibson  8. Pat Beverly   9. Ricky Rubio
PUNISHED TAJ GIBSON
Taj Gibson ha a 1.000 win % when he starts at PF. He’s above no biraids Randle
Taj Gibson is your second favorite player hahah
"Can we get jimmy butler over to the Knicks?? Then they’ll have Jimmy, D Rose, Thibs, and Taj Gibson. I’ll just imagine it’s the bulls"
TIL Elfrid Payton is on the Knicks. TIalsoL that Taj Gibson is still on the NBA and is on the Knicks.
"Whenever they play a good team. My exact point is they blew their cap space. Reason: they needed to use that cap space to gather assets to trade for good players. They largely failed to do that. You could have gotten 5 first rounders out of 70M in cap space if they were smart, which they weren't. So now, when Thibs wants to Win Now and grind up the rookies for protein to feed Taj Gibson, they don't have enough assets to trade for a star. Don't believe me?  Reality says they traded second rounders and role players for Rose because that's all they really had in terms of assets to trade. If you think logically and not with emotion and narrative (how 99% of this sub thinks), you could have charted out how the Knicks could have done things differently and gathered enough assets to trade for Harden.  I think its embarrassing the Nets with no picks all those years gathered more assets than the Knicks who could do whatever they wanted. Question: who had more assets to trade for Harden, the Nets or Knicks? Pick a team. But this is a circlejerk thread no room for thoughtcrimes like mine."
No one leaves until Taj Gibson gets 40 mins of action.
Excuse me! Taj Gibson exist.. he was this years biggest snub..
 Taj Gibson looks like a backup Center from the ABA.
"Freddie just mauled Taj Gibson with no call, the refs are not calling shit either way."
Shoutout to the Knicks for giving me a chance (9 years later) to watch a Drose-Taj Gibson pick and roll on a Thibs playoff team
Taj Gibson. Will never fill a stat sheet but dude always makes a huge impact in the game
"No particular order but Julius Randle, RJ Barrett, Alec Burks, Immanuel Quickley, Reggie Bullock, Derrick Rose, Nerlens Noel, Taj Gibson, and healthy Mitchell Robsinon."
"Very common in this sub to put players in 4 categories. Star, Role Player, prospect, washed. Every player in the NBA has a specific role. Even Marc Gasol has value in his role with the Lakers. Taj Gibson wasn’t on a roster to start the season and is vital to the Knicks. Alec Burks another guy looked past is playing incredible. All about team, fit, opportunity etc."
"taj gibson is still a good rebounder and defender, makes the right passes and can make shots from within 10-12 feet if needed"
Yeah until he trades himself to the Knicks for taj Gibson and Obi toppin
Taj gibson
"Dont sleep on Taj Gibson, he also stayed with Thibs in Minnesota."
"I don't know what the hell was going on last night. Taj Gibson, Nerlens Noel, Trae Young, Clint Capella.... everyone got hurt.  Hope Trae's okay. Had he played the whole night there's a very good chance this game has a different result. I thought we were going to have to bust out Frank Ntilikina to at least try and defend him."
Taj Gibson gives 110% every single play. He may not be the most talented dude but there ain’t even one possession where he ain’t leave out all he has. That’s competitive right there.
Taj Gibson is rolling in his grave somewhere.
He’s OK but a 37 year old Taj Gibson is still way better.
Taj Gibson too
"Tonight is cursed. Trae, Boucher, Avdija, Taj Gibson hurt his eye, etc."
Bruh why you gotta do Taj Gibson like this
"By servicable back up bigs do you mean 38 year old Kurt Thomas who started 37 games, a rookie Omer Asik and Brian Scalabrine? Because those 3 don't even average 10 points per game combined that season lol  The only good big we had was Taj Gibson who wasn't as good at that point of his career as a sophomore averaging 7 and 6..."
Do (Taj Gibson) you (Taj Gibson) mean (Taj Gibson) like (Taj Gibson) this? (Taj Gibson)
"Yeah, thats like the whole point. (Taj Gibson, Moses Malone, Horace Grant)"
How so? Do i have to type taj gibson in every comment of mine to prove i haven't forgotten him?
"Shout out to Reggie Bullock and Taj Gibson. No headlines, no ego, just really solid players I'm proud to have on my team.   For the first time as a Knick fan we are good and it seems sustainable. There are obvious areas for improvement, but my god the base we're improving from has been raised exponentially.   As a Brit living in Australia, I'm proud to YERRRRRR today."
Credit to Taj Gibson
Big dick Thibs😎  Fat Cock randle😈  R “The J is for Juicy Johnson” Barret😫  Taj Horse Cock Gibson😳  Derrick the Heavy Hog Rose😱  Dicking down the league again color me suprised😏
"Taj Gibson deserves one, but he’d be a genuine asset to any contender regardless"
Is that not the case for the Jazz? Lmao. Snyder is a great coach and they have arguably the best depth in the league. We play Taj Gibson and Elfrid Payton significant minutes...

Taj Gibson.
Imagine going from banging Nerlens Noel and Taj Gibson down low to banging Embiid.
This trash bag capela was talking crazy against a team that had to play Taj Gibson due to injuries.   He’ll be chilling with Taj in Cancun shortly
It’s why Thibs loved Taj Gibson and brought him back
Enes Kanter  Jarrett Allen  Nikola Vucevic  Taj Gibson
Was easy for Capela to talk shit when his competition was 35 year old Taj Gibson. Embiid doing whatever he wants to Capela now.
"City of Chicago wasn't informed.  I think the fan vote happened within Thibs' office. That would explain why Jimmy Butler got a 2nd place vote, Taj Gibson got a 3rd place vote, Luol Deng got a 4th place vote, and Carlos Boozer got a 5th place vote."
"Thibs gets coach of year for playing D Rose a ton of minutes, and re-signing Taj Gibson? What year is it, again?"
"Why would Leon Rose get it? He hasn't truly done anything groundbreaking with the roster besides getting Rose for DSJ and a second round pick. He signed Burks, Noel, and Rivers. Burks had a solid year off the bench, Noel was pretty much thrust into the starting spot due to Robinson's injuries, Rivers was traded for a second round pick and two bench players who got waived. Taj Gibson basically came back cause Thibs made a call and we got him for the low. Honestly the biggest things we can credit Leon Rose and Worldwide Wes for are drafting IQ, not doing anything fucking stupid like r/NBA wanted us to do in the off season or make pointless trades at deadline.  The roster from last year into this year is pretty much 80% the same. I don't know where this ""That'll go to the Knicks GM obviously"" mess is coming from."
Drose  Kirk Hinrich  Kyle korver Taj gibson Joakim noah
"Why the fuck didn't the Knicks push for KD/Kyrie? Why? The had the cap space and they used it on Julius Randle, Bobby Portis, Elfrid Payton, and Taj Gibson. I still don't get it."
"&gt; As for the Knicks, the goal was to create cap space to sign KD and Kyrie, but they got neither and used that cap space on Marcus Morris, Elfrid Payton, Bobby Portis, Julius Randle, and Taj Gibson.  The return on this was just outstanding. Flipped Marcus Morris for Quickley + DSJ for D Rose, Regular-Season Randle, etc.."
Kristaps for Taj Gibson. Who says no? Mavs sure need a rebounder
"your team struggled all playoffs on offense. Especially with shooting. And Timmy is a shooter. But this goes back to my earlier point I've made in other threads; you guys didn't gather enough assets during your down times and now that you're trying to win you have barely any trade assets. you had 70M in cap space and you immediately spent it on taj gibson, bobby portis, etc. You could have used all that cap space to absorb contracts for first round picks. Then, with enough picks, you could have put in a competitive offer for Harden. How is is the nets had more trade assets then you guys did?  My theory is nba teams either need to be gathering mode getting trade assets (like squirrels gathering nuts for the winter) or spending mode getting talent to win it all. Teams that do one or another know who they are. Teams that do neither are in nba purgatory Hell. Let's see how you guys spend your cap space. Don't extent Randle to a max offer. Please."
"Do they really? Hawks players getting heavy overrated with recency bias after beating up on Knicks team that was relying on Alec Burks, Taj Gibson and Rose to even be competitive."
The hawks only scored 109 pp100 against the Knicks which would be ranked 21st in the NBA and that was with Rose starting and Taj Gibson starting
Taj Gibson whenever he’s coached by Thibs
"If Embiid stays healthy for the series, Atlanta will have a hell of a time trying to get the screens to work for Trae. Embiid is such a versatile defender, switches onto Young won't burn him. And he is someone Capela has to stay active on, Capela was basically a blocking and rebounding pylon during the Knicks series.   Taj Gibson and Nerlens Noel is a far cry from Dwight Howard and Joel Embiid. Atlanta need a HUGE boost from secondary point production to pull ahead in the series. Philly will not run out of good guards to throw against Young. I wanna say that Collins and Hunter will have to step up offensively, maybe get Bogdan some good looks from 3 and hopefully Lou will pulls out 6MOTY caliber performances in this series."
"His shot only looked normal in Game 4 and 5. Clint Capela just sat in the paint and the Hawks took away his baseline jumper. The Knicks just simply didn't have the personnel to takedown the Hawks. I don't think Taj Gibson even started on the Thib's Bulls. Without Drose on the bench, our bench became Burks, Noel, and two rookies. Our team just isn't good enough."
"Thank you Trae Young. While I am sad this ride is over, you gave us a great ending and a new rivalry that I hope last for years. It is hard to imagine a Knicks fan feeling disappointed with this result. We weren't supposed to be here. We have a max player now in Julius. RJ is legit. Quickley is legit. Toppin was coming on to end the year. Nerlens played way above expectations when Mitch went down. MITCH IS COMING BACK. Elf is probably gone. D Rose played GREAT for us. Bullock was drilling shit this year. Taj Gibson came off the street and helped anchor the paint. Luca is coming next year. Two first round picks to add as well. And we have a boat load of cap space still. I think the best is yet to come for this team."
"I mean sure Randle, Taj Gibson, Barrett and old D-Rose are the same as Ewing, Oakley, KJ and Starks 🙏"
"King of the lower seeds!   He beat a starting lineup of Taj Gibson, 2011 MVP Rose, &amp; Reggie Bullock. How this Knicks team got top 4 seed after the betting over/under was 22 wins, I still don't know. I believe that's more an impediment to everyone in the East not the Nets, Philly &amp; Bucks but I'm prob just salty"
When I saw Trae takes a “bow” I assumed this was going to involve Taj Gibson lol
"Reggie bullock, taj Gibson"
TIL Taj Gibson is still in the NBA
lmao Taj Gibson just hugging OO that whole time
"Taj Gibson just spit all over the court y’all see that, nasty"
Tough game for the Knicks. But you won't be successful with Bullock and Taj Gibson as your starters. These guys were barely rotation players elsewhere.
"I mean it when I say fuck Timbs, foldable pizza, NYPD, Taj Gibson and the Knicks."
"never thought hawks fans were so whiny until I saw the comments in this thread  you'd think taj gibson committed a drive by murder from the comments here, its hilarious"
Shocked Nerlens Noel and a 50 year old Taj Gibson aren't shutting him down.
Taj Gibson loves throwing those little elbows/shoulders into people. Scrub move honestly
Taj Gibson is straight up ASS. The Knicks are so unfortunate they have him instead of Robinson
Fuck taj Gibson
Bro you don’t want that smoke with taj Gibson
"He also called Taj Gibson ""Minage Gibson"""
Taj Gibson
"the same, he wouldn't be any better than taj gibson  taj has been amazing"
Shootout to Taj Gibson. I have no clue how he’s starting on a playoff team 7 years past his prime lol
Taj Gibson is awful
I wonder how tough he'd be talking if he was playing against an actual starter-quality center instead of the corpse of Taj Gibson and a wax statue of Nerlens Noel.  Good luck against Philly big guy.
"All of that trash talk from a franchise just because they beat a lottery projected team that starts 35 years old Taj Gibson and reggie bullock in the playoffs while you are paying Gallo 20M per year to come off the bench  Your team is not a conteding team, and if anything hawks are one of the very few franchises that has been as trash as the knicks the last 20 years.   Hawks fans gotta be some of the most toxic shits ive encoutered on here"
"The Knicks might be looking to compete for some heavyweight belts in boxing, too, and taj Gibson deserves a super bowl ring"
"That entire team had no confidence and completely let russ does everything except defend.   That led to amazing things in the regular season. But when it mattered, they got exposed rightfully. Russ never got them involved or let them have the ball enough during his mvp year because he was trying to cement himself as a legend. He did, but because he had the highest usage rate in history his team never truly got comfortable.   Am I saying they would've been a 60 win team if oladipo Taj Gibson and adams were given the ball more? No. That team still ass. But they would've taken more than one game. They wouldn't have looked like beaten dog everytine russ sat."
Taj Gibson
"Thybule from 76ers, Joe ingles, nerlens noel/taj Gibson, Kyle Anderson"
"I think we should maybe push the brakes on comparing Siakam's ability to..lead?..a roster of championship-level complementary starter and rotation pieces to the second round to Randle's ability to lead 32 yo D Rose, Nerlens Noel, Alec Burks, 35 yo Taj Gibson, Reggie Bullocks and 1st and 2nd year players to the playoffs.  No offense meant to Siakam who is a great player and nothing even implied about the Siakam/Randle comparison itself in a more serious context - but this comparison makes absolutely no sense whatsoever."
To be less effective than Taj Gibson
"Yes a Chicago Taj Gibson flair, where your fans are too pussy to put a flair like your boy traeway commenting dumb ass shit in every post."
This coming from a Taj Gibson flair is killing me
I always saw NYK as pretenders. You're starting Reggie Bullock and Taj Gibson or Noel &amp; you're relying on DRose to be your best player? Recipe for a FRE
Knicks starting line-up : 🤡🤡🤡🌹+Taj Gibson
"Hawks have just a lot more talent its that simple. Trae Young is a future superstar. They are a deep squad. The Knicks are starting Taj Gibson, Derrick Rose, and Reggie Bullock."
"Taj Gibson, the ideal third option"
You know you’re in trouble when your second and third options are Alec Burks and Taj Gibson respectively. (1st option is Drose which is fine)
We need Taj to bust out the goggles for game 5 and transform into KAJ Gibson plz anything
Bullock owes Taj Gibson dinner after this performance
Why are they talking about Taj Gibson more than the rest of both rosters combined?
Couple of really good Taj Gibson minutes.
Taj Gibson cannot be the only man going for a fucking rebound  Julius is the 2nd biggest man on the fucking floor and he’s letting BOGDAN BOGDANOVIC jump in front of him for rebounds  Box out you fucking choker
Has to be a little worrisome for the Knicks that Taj Gibson is legitimately one of their most important players
I love Taj Gibson
Ah yes the people surely are more interested in Taj Gibson than Trae Young 🤣
Lol it was taj gibson
"Man before this series I definitely didn't realize Hawks fans were this whiny lol. Loved this nugget  &gt;""if they called moving screens on this knicks team i think they’d turn the ball over every time taj gibson is on the floor. cheating pussy"""
Taj gibson really set a moving screen on his own teammate.
if they called moving screens on this knicks team i think they’d turn the ball over every time taj gibson is on the floor. cheating pussy
Why does Taj Gibson play so much? I don’t think he would be in rotation for 29 other teams ...
Taj gibson is playing some good defence
Taj Gibson is still in the NBA ❓
Lol Taj Gibson and D-Rose running the fast break in 2021
Point God Taj Gibson
Taj Gibson?
"This free throw disparity thing is the dumbest story line of the postseason so far.  Any one who watched this game and actually understand the game of basketball knows that the refs were fair that game.  There was a lot of missed calls on both sides, nothing out of the ordinary.  The reason why there was a foul disparity is because of the way the hawks set up their defense.  They are focusing 2 guys (primary defender and capella) completely on randle, and always have a 3rd guy ready to help when he is on the move.  This has been drawing randle into his major flaw of his game (dribbling into traffic) and causing him to either pass out or take a wild shot/attack a bigger more athletic center.  Randle's major options to dump off to when he is being swarmed at is taj/injured noel, both of whom cannot play above the rim.  When the ball goes out, capela or the extra help defender has to over-commit late.  And since literally no one on the knicks besides obi toppin can play above the rim after Noel's injury, fouls tend to happen more than dunks or layups. Between randle and noel there was 20 of the 30 ft's, but no one is talking about how this swarming style of defense held the 2 of them to 3 made FG's, completely neutralizing the knicks entire offense.    The way the hawks played offense also contributed to their lack of FT's as well.  The knciks stout defense, predicated around having 2 elite shot blocker is completely dead with noel hurt and a 35 year old 6'9"" taj gibson as their starting center.  Half of the hawks points (55) came inside, and most of those shots were completely uncontested because of Noel being hobbled. Almost all of the rest of their points came from shooting 59% from 3.  The hawks didn't get a lot of foul calls, simply because they weren't taking any contested shots.  They were raining 3s and getting open looks after open looks under the basket.  It's hard to get fouls when you are getting a games worth of free opportunity.  Tldr (because salty fans won't read lets be honest) the hawks played a smothering type of defense extremely prone to committing fouls.  They committed fouls.  However in result, they completely trashed the knicks offense.  Please stop crying when things are working as designed."
"Only loyalty I have to former players is Derrick Rose and taj gibson, Bubble boy butler trashed our franchise when he left."
A la Taj Gibson
Taj Gibson gets away with more than I’ve ever seen excluding the warriors team
this is taj gibson erasure. we’d be down 3-0 without him.
Can we sign Taj Gibson to playing o-line for the Falcons? Dude is straight up shoving people out of the way on picks. That’s not basketball
Hawks are averaging 14 FT a game which is 10 less a game than the regular season. I expect less in the playoffs but that is a major discrepancy.   Meanwhile the Knicks are averaging like 22 a game and only average 20 during the season. 2/3 games they have gone above their season average.   NBA really needs to refund Nate’s money. Taj Gibson is allowed to foul and set moving screens with impunity(which almost had a big implication game 1). Randle essentially punched Bogi in the head game 1 with no call.   I’m fine getting less FTs a game but needs to go both ways. There’s no way the FTs were 30-8 last night
"I thought this would be a fun series but I’m seriously losing all respect for NY. Tripping Trae, this shit, moving screens, I saw Noel try to shoulder tackle Hunter last night, Taj Gibson extending his ass and hips out like a female tryna lure a baby daddy, pathetic shit these dudes are resorting to. The free throw difference and refs allowing NY to play this way has turned comical. “Oh but it’s the playoffs!!!” Yeah?  Then why the FUCK can’t WE play like it. Collins got 3 fouls in 2 minutes on Sunday...."
Taj Gibson
"m’classy knicks featuring reggie ‘flagrant’ bullock, Taj ‘Offensive Tackle’ Gibson and Nerlens ‘Slewfoot’ Noel can’t catch a. break against this foul merchant"
If Taj Gibson was called for even half of the fouls he commits he would foul out midway thru the 3rd quarter
Lmao Taj Gibson and Obi Toppin closing a playoff game over Randle and the Knicks might max the dude 😂
I'd rather have Taj Mahal on offense than Taj Gibson. What a complete fucking zero on offense.
Taj Gibson is on the opposite of fire this game.
Does Taj Gibson have any offensive game whatsoever?
"The Knicks lost the game from the Taj Gibson missed free putback dunk which lead to 2 points for the Hawks and a 4 point swing.  After that they have collapsed, momentum is a real thing"
Taj Gibson literally is doing a moving screen on every possesion!!!
Taj Gibson with the sorta missed putback that can lead to an ensuing monster collapse
capela is eating Taj Gibson right now.
Taj Gibson has been trying out for Mekhi Becton's job for two fucking games and that's the illegal screen that gets called
"We have Derrick Rose, Taj Gibson, and Joakim Noah on our payroll. We are a Carlos Boozer and Luol Dent away from being the 2011 Chicago Bulls"
Two things. 1) I didn't realize Taj Gibson was still around. 2) he sets great screens.
"Dunno how the Knicks should feel about d rose, taj gibson, and alec burks being their biggest playoff competitors"
"Rose, Taj Gibson, and Tom Thibodeau.  Are we in 2021 or 2011?"
Taj Gibson about to be signed by the Giants for $15m/yr
In 2021 Taj Gibson and DRose are winning more playoff games than Butler
Taj Gibson and Enes Kanter are at the top of the Jokic shit-list
And Damian lilliard is left with Taj Gibson 😂
Taj Gibson and LeBron are only 6 months apart.  Taj Gibson was drafted 6 years after LeBron
"Well it depends on your draft spot and this post is talking about Cade Cunningham. If you draft a player at #26 who says his goal is to be the next Taj Gibson that's cool, Taj Gibson was a great pick for that late in the first round. But if you're picking #1 you don't want Taj Gibson with that pick."
The Taj Gibson vs Javale McGee debate should be stickied to the top of r/NBA as the epicenter of the off season.
Taj Gibson? It's not 2015 anymore
John Collins. Fuck it gimme Taj Gibson. Literally anyone but lazy KLove.
true but taj gibson was playing him off the court in the playoffs because noel is an offensive liability on par with payton. Dude cant catch the ball
"Kemba Walker, Donovan Mitchell, Hamidou Diallo, Obi Toppin, Taj Gibson or Mo Bamba"
Taj Gibson bbyyyyyy💯😮‍💨
"&gt; Randle doesn’t play 48 minutes a game.  He was the closest player in the NBA to it. Lead the league in MPG and total minutes. A common staple of Thibs best player.   Not to mention, Randle is bad at the 5 because he is a poor rim protector. That’s why he hardly played at the 5.   And I’m not saying Randle held back Toppin, I’m saying Thibs has always had short benches/rotations. Makes sense that he is playing favourites with a guy like Taj Gibson who he coached in Chicago and in Minnesota.   And Randle isn’t one of the most versatile players in the league? The fuck you talking about? He basically has to play the 4 because of how limited his defensive game is."
He didn’t play over those guys because he wasn’t good. Thibs doesn’t have a problem playing young guys or anything. He played who was best for us. Quickley was a main part of our rotation because he actually played well. How is not being able to play your way into a rotation being buried? He stunk lol. We signed Taj Gibson off the street and would play him next to Nerlens because that was more effective than giving Toppin minutes most of the season.
"&gt;more like hey we tried to sign all these guys who actually don't really work for the modern NBA.  What a stupid fucking thing to say lol, Marcus Morris is a legit piece for the Clippers, Bobby Portis is a legit piece for the Bucks, Taj Gibson is a solid backup 5 for a playoff team, Randle is an All NBA player, which one of those guys don't work in the modern nba?"
"Did you even watch us this year. Our two best playoff performers were Derrick Rose and Taj Gibson. They might not even be on the team next year. Plus it's not like we have a team that's poised to go deep in the playoffs. Randle and RJ need to get over their mental struggles in the playoffs, and the best way to get there is to actually get there in the first place which DeRozan will help with."
"Crazy to think he could have been the next Michael Phelps, but instead he became a glorified Taj Gibson."
I remember Taj Gibson looking like Hakeem Olajuwon against him that season. I think the Bulls destroyed the Warriors in both matchups largely because they couldn’t guard bigs.
"I just hate when people act like the counting stats of these centers determine how well they play. The most important things u need as a role-playing center are limited TOs, good hands and finishing, good screens, versatile defense, rim protection, rebounding. Drummond only provides a single one of those. You could have 6 points 8 rebounds like Taj Gibson and be absolutely great in the game or you can have 12/10 like Drummond and still be a huge negative."
"Nets: The big three with prime Blake, DJ, Aldridge, healthy Spencer Dinwiddie, prime Jeff Green, Joe Harris Heat Tyler Johnson, Knicks Shumpert(if not waived), Thunder Andre Roberson(if not waived).

Westbrook had Oladipo, Sabonis, Jermai Grant, Taj Gibson, Steven Adams, and other great role players in the year he “dragged” them to the playoffs. Later had Paul George."
"A couple of seasons ago Kuzma was getting housed by Taj Gibson, that he's a credible defender now is a miracle."
I honestly thin that Taj Gibson would make a great basketball analyst. Dude is a smart player
Where’s the Taj Gibson love?
Taj Gibson is the Michael Jordan of this era.. just in terms of the baldness and the bald energy that he brings
"Just Demar, Taj Gibson, and Bruno Caboclo (he was also really nice)"
"Danny Green to the Knicks along with Dame in a trade and DeMar as a free agent. Trading Barrett, Quickley, Toppin, Robinson and picks for Dame. Then bring back some of the role players on team-friendly deals:  Damian Lillard, Danny Green, DeMar DeRozan, Julius Randle, Nerlens Noel.   Luca Vildoza, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Kevin Knox, Taj Gibson."
Elfrid Payton gets banned from stepping into any Knicks related facility/arena  and we acquire an all-star caliber PG and or SF. Also re-signing D Rose and Taj Gibson would be nice
Taj Gibson
"Luol Deng. He’s taught numerous fellow black players in the league the art of real estate including D rose Taj Gibson etc. Long story short, Deng’s career earnings on the court are $151 million.  He’s been investing in real estate almost since the time he entered the league in 2004 and has amassed an impressive portfolio—hotels, resorts, condos and apartment buildings—worth $125 million.  His real estate earnings alone almost equal his career nba earnings. Truly impressive.  Here’s an article on it in case you’re wondering   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2019/06/21/the-nbas-unlikeliest-real-estate-mogul-luol-dengs-125-million-portfolio-is-a-new-playbook-for-monetizing-fame/amp/"
how did Taj Gibson outlast that man lol
"They literally gave the Knicks their current team. Knicks got RJ via ridding themselves of KP, DSJ got them drose, cap space from KP contract got them Julius Randle, Taj Gibson and Marcus Morris. Marcus Morris got them Immanuel Quickley. Not to mention the fact that KP trade expedited fizdale and the contemporary FO getting ousted in favor of Leon Rose/Worldwide Wes who hired Thibs. The Knicks post KP trade have literally made it just as far as Luka’s Mavericks lol.Oh and the Knicks have two firsts from mavericks they can play around with.    Mavericks did get Tim Hardaway though so that cool but Knicks literally acquired five of their top 8 players as a near direct result of the KP trade"
"It’s not a perfect stat obviously, but Rubio is 11th in win shares behind:   Harden, Curry, Griffin, DeRozan, Taj Gibson, Teff Teague, Darren Collison, Jrue, Danny Green and Ty Lawson"
We had Taj Gibson as our only healthy 5
Tbh I think some NBA guys are playing. Taj Gibson is there but point stands
"Ibaka is a waste of salary for this team. Give me Taj Gibson for the vet min $2.4MM.   I'm gonna get wild with it and move it and move Jamal Murray to the 2 and add De'Aron Fox as a second max player.   Replacing Anunoby with Crowder for the salary savings.  Also, using 2021 salary figures.  PG: De'Aron Fox ($28MM)  SG: Jamal Murray ($29.5MM)  SF: Luguentz Dort($1.8MM)  PF: Jae Crowder($9.7MM)  C: Clint Capela($17MM)  G3:TJ McConnell ($3.5MM)  G4: Alec Burks ($6MM)  Wing3: Dorian Finney-Smith ($4MM)  Wing4: Nic Batum ($2.6MM)  C2: Taj Gibson($2.4MM)"
Teague is to bud as taj Gibson is to thibbs
"Obviously, the Knicks will pick up Trae in the near future to play alongside Booker and Taj Gibson."
Taj Gibson was my answer. He destroyed us during those rebuilding years
pretty sure i see taj gibson and justise winslow?
"Exactly, btw 🤝 Taj Gibson &amp; Rose love. See yall in the playoffs soon."
"Never said they were contenders- just that by watching them you could see that their lack of talent was made up for with great coaching and unselfish team basketball.  Also, the Celtics were absolutely healthy. Before Jaelyn Brown got injured they were still worse than the Knicks all season- because the Knicks played better as a team and were the better team despite not having Tatum or Brown  Btw Knicks were missing their starting center nearly all season long which deserves to be mentioned- imagine how much better they would’ve been playing Mitchell Robinson instead of Taj Gibson lol"
Ah the Taj Gibson classic
i remember knicks fans being pissed at the foul calls while taj gibson was basically setting moving screens every possession in game 2. it's ridiculous
"Why did you have to include Taj Gibson, the 82-0 is not possible because of it. Jokic hates Taj Gibson more than anybody hates anything in the world and plays like a man posseted against his teams. Now they will only go 80-2"
lol Taj Gibson is still playing?
Mitchell/Luka/Zion/Randle/Taj Gibson going 82-0 next year
"I think it's more of roster issue than Giannis. I like Middleton and Jrue but neither are particularly good at creating for Giannis. Ideally, I see Giannis's offense as a superstar version of John Collins and Taj Gibson - transition, pick and roll finisher, lob threat, putbacks, and draining open sideline jumpers (threes should be much more rare). He needs more of a post-game for the playoffs too (at the C spot, which they can play in specific lineups like Lakers do with AD).  For that though, you'd need a superstar ball handling guard with range - someone like Dame or Harden. They'd always have the mismatch with pick and rolls, especially with Giannis at C. It's obviously not realistic but it would be absolutely lethal. This series, I really like Giannis taking those jumpers 1-2 steps out of the paint vs open 3s (that the defense wants him to take)."
"I think he can dominate the league as GM. He is arguably the best asset OKC had even more so than even Durant and WB. The only thing holding him back is OKC. Iam an OKC fan but no one wants to come here during free agency and that's what really hurt this team during the Durant and WB era. We are always at the top of the conference and just need a few role players (always had a trash bench) to push them over the top. We were always active to get good role players but no one really signs. So Presti traded a lot to get some role players like Dion Waiters (amazing during his time with the Thunder) Taj Gibson, Kanter etc.. Unfortunately, Durant leaves and we had limited draft so the fact that we got PG is amazing. Instead of WB leaving we got him and PG to stay then flipped them when it didn't work to now having one of the brightest future in the NBA."
"Worked my summers at a restaurant/lounge in uptown NY. It had a beach side built in it and it was next to the Hudson river. Very popular spot for like 3 years. I would see a bunch of players from time to time, you know the ones you expect to see out; JR Smith, Lou Will, Taj Gibson, Javale McGee etc etc. lots of musicians as well. All this to say 2 stories lol;  1. This was the summer before Carmelo’s FA, i had seen other basketball players there but when i heard Carmelo was coming in to chat with one of the managers  i was like “YO I NEED TO MEET HIM”. So i asked, begged, my manager and he told me to pull up and take a pic. So i did and we took one &amp; then idk why but i said the corniest/cliché shit ever “Ey melo, i know you a free agent, but whatever you do man just be happy” he gave me a lil smirk and said “yeah man no doubt”. He went on to sign that extension with NY.  2. There was a time Rondo came in. He was sitting down with some shades on and he was with a crew. I didn’t realize till one of my co-workers had told me “yo that pg from boston is right over there” holy shit fucking Rondo is here let me snap a picture. “Click” i swear to god he heard the camera sound IDK HOW. The second i took the picture he turned around. Pointed his big ass index finger to me with a come here gesture. I look around in disbelief “me?” He nods... im literally shitting my pants, wtf he wants 😳. When i get close hes like “yo you took a picture of me” im like “yeah i did” “why!?” “Idk, you’re an nba superstar and you at my place of work. Thought id capture that moment” he lowered his shades and looks me dead in the eye. “Let me see the picture” so i show him. The picture was just a side portrait of him. Nothing crazy. He looks at me again and is like “what you gunna do with that” i looked at him confused “nothing? Prob show my friends when the semester starts. Dw i won’t put it up on social media, i respect ya privacy” he then goes “if you respect my privacy you wouldn’t snap a picture of me without me knowing” in my head im like “damn mf got a point” he then dapped me up and let me rock lol."
"Aside from Butler, Rubio and maybe Taj Gibson, who are the good defensive players he played with?"
"They did suck, but having watched those teams, they weren't just bad, they were maddeningly bad.  We had Byron Scott who had been regarded as a pretty good coach.  He coached the Nets to the Finals in the early 2000's, coached CP3 on the Hornets to some really good years, was on the Cavs when Lebron was in Miami, and then came back to LA to lead an aging Kobe and Pau with random pieces.  He was the Tank Commander for a reason, his schemes and rotations made little sense for a coach who wasn't some newbie like Luke Walton was.  For someone who had success, it is more likely he sucked on purpose rather than on accident given the disparity in effort, though of course there's no way to prove that.  However, we won 27 games during those years bottoming out at 17, we didn't just suck, we historically sucked.  Its hard to say that even with bad players, we couldn't have swung a trade or gotten a free agent to make us at least competitive.    And Kobe being on the team proves my point.  He was our one star for years, it would have been disrespectful to not try to at least let him end his career with some dignity instead of 17 win shit team.  We gave him $50m for essentially sitting out, just because people still cared about him.  It would have taken almost no effort to pair him up with some more vets and tried to do something (like Jim Buss tried to do with Deng and Mozgov), but instead that was the last gasp of a guy being forced out of his team.  We barely tried because we didn't want to.  And another thing that proves my point: the Lakers' salary during the tank years.  You can say Byron sucked and our players sucked, but you cannot say our Front Office kept trying to put together a winning product.  [In 2012-2013](https://hoopshype.com/salaries/los_angeles_lakers/2012-2013/), we had the highest salary in the league at $100m.  When we started tanking the next year, we dropped only to #4 in the league but shaved off $25m.  The next year we dropped to #9 in the league, and the following year in 2015-2016 we dropped to #19.  This is not the salary of a team who's trying.  The next 3 years we were #19, #21, and #27 in league salary.  Why didn't we sign more Mozgov's and Deng's if we wanted to win?  There are plenty of vets we could throw a big contract to if we really wanted to go for it every year.  We could have at least maintained a top #10 ranking in salary if we wanted to compete, the Lakers' name plus the money would have gotten free agents to join, right?    The salary, more than anything, should be proof we didn't try.  We could give anyone money, who would turn down a fat check from the Lakers?  At the time Carmelo was bouncing around the league and Kobe was gone, we could have said to him ""Hey, here's $25m, come start for the Lakers and be the face of the franchise for a few years"".  Other than Melo, there were plenty of guys past their prime or guys good enough to make a team competitive that we could have thrown money at during the lean years.  Guys like Horford, Whiteside, Dion Waiters, Pau, Harrison Barnes, Gordon Hayward, Millsap, JJ Redick, Gallinari, Taj Gibson, Olynyk, Rudy Gay, Aaron Gordon, Zach Lavine, Derrick Favors, DeAndre Jordan, etc.  I'm sure not all of them would have come, and some of them were never going to leave their team, but if the Lakers came calling with a blank check, I've no doubt we could have gotten a few of those guys as our starters.  Other people who derisively talk about the Lakers brand would have to admit that in this case, it would support the argument that the Lakers didn't get them because they didn't try, not because they couldn't, which is evidence enough for me that we were taking on purpose and not on accident.  And yes, thank you for this discussion, its rare people can disagree without insults.  Kinda nice! 😁"
Did they not hear we resigned Taj Gibson? Dude is back and balder than ever.  Odds way to low.
"Let me tell you, as a Wolves fan I would KILL for a consistent string of 1st round playoff exits.... Big market teams don't really understand what it is like to not have FAs want to come to you. Ever. Like never ever ever. The Lakers best ever FA signing is a toss up between Lebron and Shaq. The Wolves best ever FA singing is a toss up between Kevin Martin and Taj Gibson. Then comes the tanking, so we small market teams need to tank to get top prospects, but once they sign their 2nd contract it still becomes hard to build a team of competent role players around them, because you are overpaying for FAs to come live there. There is no Danny Green tier players that will come here. The best case scenario for a small market team is to find diamonds in the rough that stay loyal to their franchise. GSW isn't a small market team, but before they had not too much FA sway. But Curry is better than anyone could have guessed, and Draymond is an absolute gem of a late pick, pair that with a coach that has an innovative system that fits their players strength and now you have a contender, once you are in contender rankings you get the chance to sign KD."
Jokic is legit amazing at basketball he first popped on my radar the year they were fighting with the wolves for the 8 seed he was absolutely destroying KAT thibs had to put Taj Gibson on him
"Kat is not underrated, we’ve seen him the playoffs when Jimmy was there and he was awful. Dude was legit lost on the defence taj Gibson had to push him to the right defensive assignment"
Derrick Rose didn’t have a problem with KAT. Robert Covington didn’t have a problem with KAT. Taj Gibson didn’t have a problem with KAT. Ricky Rubio never had a problem with KAT. Literally no one ever had a problem with KAT but Butler yet somehow KAT is the one to blame for running people off his team. Gotcha. Great argument.
I can’t believe they have a whole park named after Taj Gibson
"The reason he wore 21 in Chicago and is wearing 22 in Miami is because both franchises have 23 retired and starting his career with the Bulls, Taj Gibson had already taken 22"
No no it's less a commentary on him personally but more about what usually happens to us as a team when we get an older vet on our team not named Taj Gibson.
"People act like the Wolves never had talent when almost every year they are a dark horse playoff team. I spent like five years thinking, “oh man, these Wolves are a team to watch!” until I realized KAT just doesn’t make anyone any better. They underperform every year. It certainly doesn’t help him that Wiggins never ever developed at all considering his own hype.   I think it is also telling that Jimmy Butler couldn’t get out of Minnesota fast enough, because all he wants to do is win and he didn’t feel like MN was the right place for that. A lot of that was on KAT. If you are the dominant big everyone says he is, than there would almost be no better team to be on than the Wolves for Jimmy. I mean, that 17-18 team was absolutely loaded. KAT, Butler, Wiggins, Jeff Teague, Derrick Rose, Jamal Crawford, Taj Gibson with Tom Thibodeau coaching and people act like KAT never had any help.  They were the 8th seed after Jimmy got hurt halfway through the season. They were in the top 4 of the West before that. It’s like KAT tries to not make the playoffs. I’m sure if the season were ten games longer, they probably would have missed it then too.   All those underperforming seasons really soured me on KAT."
"Bulls fan here. Almost all our guys we drafted post Jordan era showed flashes of stardom but ended up being sort of nothing:   Ben Gordon, Luol Deng, Tyrus Thomas, Taj Gibson,  Doug McDermott, Nikola Mirotic, Bobby Portis, Denzel Valentine, Lauri Markannen, Wendell Carter Jr.   No, I don’t count Derrick Rose. He won MVP, all star starter, blew out the big 3 Heat in the ECF in Game 1, and single handedly stopped the Linsanity."
"There is no guarantee in free agency. Knicks thought they will get Kyrie and KD in 2019, they got Julius Randle, Bobby Portis and Taj Gibson instead.  Trading for a Carmelo gives them an edge in negotiations."
Taj Gibson
And Taj Gibson too
"Exactly. MPJ is an elite play finisher, but Murray is way ahead of him in other aspects of the game like playmaking.   MPJ had one of the worst assist percentages in the league last year at 5.2%, good for 487th in the league.  For reference, the two players immediately ahead of him are Willie Cauley-Stein and Taj Gibson, and those right below him are Lauri Markkanen and Daniel Gafford.  To compare, before the injury Murray was 111th at 19.7%. Other similar shotmaking wings also rank a lot higher, like Tatum (113th, 19.6%), PG13 (67th, 23.9%), Brandon Ingram (87th, 21.8%).  On top of that, 79.2% of his made shots were assisted on. Other elite wings can create for themselves much more reliably, which is a huge part of being a top option.   To compare again: Murray (41.8%), Tatum (40.8%), PG13 (42.9%), Ingram (48.5%)  He's gonna be elite as a shotmaker, but to really be a 1B type guy he needs to make some big, big strides in other areas of his game, like playmaking and creating his own shot vs. it being created for him."
"This isn't the worst in terms of losing out on a star or a championship or anything but it still baffles me years later:   Bulls trade Taj Gibson, Doug McDermott, and a 2nd round pick to the Thunder for Cam Payne, Anthony Morrow, and Joffrey Lauvergne.   If you only look at the players in that trade the Thunder win the trade easily. I know Payne isn't bad now but at the time he was meme-tier trash for both OKC and Chicago. Morrow was totally washed and out of the league after that year. Lauvergne was an end of bench guy who never did anything.   Why the hell did Garpax feel the need to throw in an extra pick?"
Thibs just found his new Taj Gibson to harass for a decade.
"Although they only did it for about 5 games until they realized Grant is just way better. By the way his MVP year they surrounded him with great shooters in the starting lineup such as Roberson, Taj Gibson, and Steven Adams lol. His MVP year gets way too much hate."
"&gt; His roster was putrid  Adams 2,400 minutes, Andre Roberson 2,400, Oladipo 2,200, Domantas Sabonis 1,600, Kanter 1,500, Jerami Grant 1,500. There's even some sneaky minutes for McDermott, Cam Payne and Taj Gibson.   I know some of those guys developed later on, but maybe Westbrook's ball dominance hid some of the talents of his teammates?"
Taj Gibson and Doug McDermott to the Thunder for god damn Cameron Payne. I still get nightmares from Gar/Pax. So glad we’re doing better now
one of the more surprising basketball things is how KD didn't make a NCAA tournament run   Got smacked in rd 2 vs Swaggy P and Taj Gibson  Durant just seems like a guy who'd go on a crazy run in a single elim tourney (he did drop 30 in the loss tho)
Lol am I the only one who rather be paying Westbrook that amount then all those guys who have a hard time being on the court 25+ minutes a game. Walker defensive liability like everyone is going to attack him and his recent injury history is making everything worse. Rose can't play more than 25 minutes a game and isnt really a 3 point shooter. Alec Burc is only appealing because they have practically no shooting on this team you really dont want this guy to do amy besides stand behind the 3pt line. Taj Gibson I mean really this dude is washed and wouldnt be playing in the NBA still if Thibbs wasn't still coaching. Nerlens is the big man that still makes his name off blocking shots by jumping and being tall but plays bad defense and is bad in schemes and almost a zero on offense. At least Westbrook is going to give me 3 months of high caliber regular season play.
I mean KAT doesn’t exactly make it easy to surround him with shooters. He’s had to play with guys like Taj Gibson because he looks incapable of anchoring a defense on his own.
this is Taj Gibson slander
Our playoff roster was Derrick Rose and Taj Gibson
"&gt; Drafting LaMarcus and trading him for Tyrus Thomas  *screams internally*  &gt; Trading Korver for nothing  This infuriated me to no end because I loved Kyle Korver  &gt; Trading Nurkic and Gary Harris for Doug McDermott, then trading Doug McDermott, Taj Gibson, and a second round pick for Cameron Payne then waiving Cameron Payne  *actual screaming*  God fucking dammnit we really traded up for Doug, then traded him away before his rookie contract was even up for a bunch of absolute garbage. And we threw in Taj Gibson as well, what the fuck  And as it turns out, it took a while but Cam Payne is actually decent, but we waived him."
"This isn’t 1950, you can be over the age of 30 and be good at basketball.  The Lakers also have old players who have transitioned really well while getting older, it’s not like they’re throwing Taj Gibson and Iguodala out there for 30 minutes a game."
"I always confuse Tony Bradley with Thomas Bryant, so at first I was excited that the Bulls got a guy like Nikola who could stretch the floor from center. Then I looked up Tony Bradley and realized he's not Thomas Bryant, but Bradley's advanced metrics are still pretty solid (20+ PER in limited minutes, for instance). So, I'm in.  Anyway, it's nice to have a solid offseason after two decades of going through things like:  * This is Phil's last year no matter what/Breaking up the best team in league history to satisfy Krause's ego. * Thinking Marcus Fizer was a small forward/an NBA player * ~~Asking Tracy McGrady if he'll shave his cornrows~~ \[Edit: Turns out I may be conflating two different stories on this one.\] * Drafting LaMarcus and trading him for Tyrus Thomas * Signing late era Ben Wallace and trading early era Ben Wallace (I.E., Tyson Chandler) * Picking the wrong Italian head coach (Del Negro instead of D'Antoni) * Striking out on LeBron, Wade, Bosh to get Boozer (who was admittedly solid and goofy) * Making Luol Deng get a spinal tap * Trading Korver for nothing * Running Thibodeau out of town * Trading Nurkic and Gary Harris for Doug McDermott, then trading Doug McDermott, Taj Gibson, and a second round pick for Cameron Payne then waiving Cameron Payne * Hiring Hoiberg to run a modern perimeter-based offense then signing Wade and Rondo * Giving up on Bobby Portis because he struck a Spaniard * \[Some additional edits\]: * [~~Jim Boylan~~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Boylan) The wrong [Jim Boylen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Boylen). * Waiving Dinwiddie (thanks to u/darealcubs for the reminder) * Just the bewildering love affair with all things Iowa State. * Trading for John Starks * Completely forgot about the short-lived John Salmons era that ended with the Bulls trading Salmons and draft picks that turned out to be Isaiah Thomas and Larry Sanders for Joe Alexander and Hakim Warrick * Not locking up Rusty LaRue on a long term deal.  Not sure I got this all in chronological order, and obviously there were some really fun Bulls teams in there (the scrappy Ben Gordon-led teams and the Derrick Rose + Bench Mob teams of the early 10s), but I am very happy with what the Bulls have done this past couple of days. This is 100% me being a homer, but I think the only teams in the East that are clearly better are Milwaukee and Brooklyn. (""Clearly"" being the key word there.)  Anyway, I'm wearing the shit out of my Bulls hat today and now I need to stop procrastinating and get back to work."
Taj Gibson is also back in NY.
"Those USC squads were pretty fun. In 08-09 they had Vuc, DeRozan, and Taj Gibson. OJ Mayo had gone 1:1 as a one and done the year before. Tim Floyd, former Bulls coach, was the coach - he got into some recruiting scandals at USC.   The new Bulls squad is funny, they have the 2 greatest NBA players to ever come out of USC, and they're 1st and 4th best players (LaVine and Ball) are from rival UCLA.   And yeah, USC is in South Central LA. Somewhat rough area immediately surrounding the campus, but the campus is very nice."

Man Knicks got the best free agency signing Taj Gibson. It's no shot for the other teams
Taj Gibson would probably give a boost to any team's bench as the 10th/11th player in their rotation
"No, the question is why would you draft him if you can neither play him nor Randle at the 3 or the 5.   That's stupid.   On the other hand, if you tried him out as a smallball 5 at times, you might actually have something. He's springy enough to be intriguing as an option there.  But they basically didn't do that. They played Taj Gibson."
"Which one of them is going to guard a 5??? Or a 3 for that matter. They are both comfortably 4’s. I wouldn’t hate trading Obi if we get good value for it, but the scenario we were discussing is why would we draft him if Taj Gibson was going to take his minutes, which was ludicrous"
I don't know what the point of picking an old prospect in the top 10 is if he's going to play 11 minutes a game while Taj Gibson plays 20.
"[[Tommy Beer]](https://twitter.com/TommyBeer/status/1422609567821750272) ""This is the veteran's minimum for a player with 10+ years of NBA experience (which Taj has) so this amount will NOT reduce the amount of cap space New York has to spend this offseason.   No-brainer for NY to bring back Gibson, who was an important contributor late last season."""
I wonder if Taj Gibson follows Thibs home at night.
Taj Gibson*
Dame.. Taj Gibson.. and if we can somehow wrassle up the remains of Luol Deng that’s a guaranteed ECF
Fr. His supporting cast with the Knicks would be Taj Gibson and Miles McBride
"Who gives a fuck why they sign there? Heat fans have gotten some of the best free agent signings this century and getting all stars for free essentially is exclusive to like 5 franchises. Miami stays a free agent destination, it doesn’t matter why people go there they do. My teams best free agent signings in the last decade are Taj Gibson and Jeff Teague. 90% of the league would kill to get Jimmy and Lowry in FA."

Depends on where Taj Gibson signs
"I’m assuming the great Taj Gibson will be brought back as well. Whether it’s with some of the remaining space, the room exception, or the minimum I’m not sure. But we know that Thibs loves him some Taj Gibson pick and roll defense."
Bulls traded taj Gibson and Doug McDermott for him the day before he was planned to be outright released from the thunder. I think it was the dumbest move garpax ever made despite the fact that he ended up turning a corner years later
Taj Gibson come on down!
"I don't think they deserve to be called the worst of all time. Most of the Garpax era had teams that were relatively competent, we were rarely among the actual worst teams in the league. We even made the playoffs a lot of years.   Their lottery picks usually weren't total busts; they were decent enough NBA players but never superstars. And with their drafting sometimes they were able to find some late round gems like Jimmy Butler or Taj Gibson.   The big problem with them is that they'd basically play it too safe. They never hit the home run. They always settled for a team that was okay enough to get people to keep coming to the United Center but were never a actual contenders outside of a couple years in the early 2010s because we got extremely lucky with the lottery.   That definitely sucks especially for a big market but I don't think it puts them in the worst of all-time discussion when there are have been teams who went decades without even a base level of competency."
Taj Gibson should be on here. He played well for us but I can't see him getting more than a vet minimum from anybody. I also don't know if he'd play outside of NY at this point because he seems to really enjoy being back home.
Nerlens Noel is the best for-bargain defensive anchor you're gonna get right now. He anchored the Knicks top defense when Taj Gibson wasn't on the floor(and Mitchell Robinson went down with injury). He will excel with a playoff team who has scoring options already.
"Nerlens Noel isnt that good and thats coming from someone who watched atleast 60 knicks games this season living in NY.  He has god awful hands on offense, doesn’t set good screens (constantly trying to slip) and on defense hes not even as good as geriatric Taj Gibson. He constantly gets overworked by more physical bigs and hes not that strong either so hell get muscled out on the boards. He’s not that fast and because of his terrible hands hes not much of a lob threat. He has really active hands and he’s long though. Guys like Nerlens basically grow on trees with how frequently players like him are part of the draft process."
Like Draymond Green saying he had the most trouble guarding Taj Gibson
Taj Gibson
"Wiggins max didn’t ruin the Wolves flexibility, being in Minnesota and having a history of losing did.  You had plenty of flexibility. You were able to trade for Jimmy Butler and then go into free agency with a lot of cap space. The Wolves did everything properly in theory.  - Get young players (Towns and Wiggins) - Consolidate other assets for star (Butler) - Get free agents while young players are still on rookie contracts and then go over the cap to extend them.  The problem is Jeff Teague, Gorgui Dieng, and Taj Gibson were what the free agency money went to.   Wiggins also wasn’t worth the max, which is part of the problem with him, while Shai obviously is. Even with that though, the biggest issue was their cap space went to guys that would quickly become bench or non-rotation players.   Wiggins max made things tough for pivoting post Butler trade, but with the Butler trade, in theory Minnesota should have been locking into a core of Butler/Towns where flexibility shouldn’t have mattered. Things just didn’t jive with that duo."
"OG Anunoby was compared to Jerami Grant, which was a fair comparable up until this past season with Grant popping off offensively  DSJ's comparison to Bledsoe was accurate, for all the wrong reasons lol.  Dearon Fox was compared to John Wall  Ben Simmons was compared to Draymond Green  Montrez Harrell was compared to Taj Gibson  Kelly Oubre was called a poor man's Paul George lol  Lavine was called a poor man's Westbrook, though they have similar playstyles, Lavine is a much better 3P shooter"
Would it be worse than Westbrook/Oladipo/Roberson/Taj Gibson/Adams
Taj Gibson &gt; Jordan
Derrick Rose &amp; Taj Gibson… but only if Thibs is coaching.
I came here wondering if he actually coined it or if he’s just the reason I’m familiar with it. But I can assure you that you’re right that he would say that shit all the time lol. Hard not to when Joakim Noah and Taj Gibson were on the team.
Taj Gibson for Damian Lillard straight is the best deal the blazers can get. Its 100% even
Taj Gibson and Rose.
Trade Damian Lillard to the knicks for Kevin Knox and Taj Gibson 🤑🤑🤑 it would be a steal
"""Westbrook played 194 minutes in the series’ five games, of which Houston won four. When Westbrook was on the floor (for 39 minutes per game), the Thunder outscored Houston by 4.9 points per 100 possessions. Taj Gibson (plus-13.7) and Steven Adams (plus-7.7) posted even better net ratings when they were on the court.  When Westbrook wasn’t on the court, Oklahoma City was even worse than you probably thought. The Thunder were outscored by 51.3 points per 100 possessions while Westbrook watched from the bench, for a total of 46 minutes during the series. That’s about one full game, scattered throughout five games, of total ineptitude."""
"All credit goes to the hawks. No excuses. But clint capela is a really really good center, and if our starters were healthy they would have struggled. Tweaked ankle noel and taj Gibson had a really uphill battle there. Plus you guys did a great job game planning us, which i dont think other teams even try to do.    Maybe its wishful thinking but I don't think that was a choke job. You guys were a tough match up that played great. All there is too it"
it’s actually Taj Gibson
"If we had the money, I would give him the same contract he is on now. Jeff Teague and Taj Gibson are the biggest free agents we have landed in the 10 years. Might as well pay whatever it takes to land a player of his quality."
Jokic taking it out on Taj Gibson ever since.
"&gt;First of all, Kirk Hinrich in the first quarter basically grabbed me with two hands and brought me to the ground. And the last one, Taj Gibson was able to collar me around my shoulder and bring me to the ground.  &gt;Those are not basketball plays. And it's been happening all year. I've been able to keep my cool and try to tell [coach Erik Spoelstra], `Let's not worry about it too much,' but it is getting to me a little bit.'  Lebron didn't like that play one bit lol. I thought it was a great foul, he grabs him to stop the and one but if he would have kept his hands up I feel like it could have been an offensive foul."
"How far would a team of ""Way Past His Prime"" and ""Scrappy Veterans"" get?  **Scrappy Veterans:**  * Paul Millsap * Wesley Matthews * Dwight Howard * Trevor Ariza * George Hill * Garrett Temple * Taj Gibson * Goran Dragic * Rudy Gay  **Way Past His Prime:**  * LaMarcus Aldridge * JJ Redick  * Jeff Green * Andre Iguodala * Carmelo Anthony * Rajon Rando * Udonis Haslem*"
"He's 7'1 and arguably came into the league underweight for his height and we cant keep counting on taj gibson to bang bodies in the paint for 20+ minutes a night. Look at guys like deandre, steven adams, and hell even tatum who all beefed up pretty considerably within their first 4 years. Our perimiter d got us in the playoffs without him last season and the hawks series showed that we need solid bodies in the paint or else we wont ever have a shot. This seems like its getting blown way out of proportion"
Taj Gibson
"Yeah, if Taj Gibson (who is underrated btw) can get playoff minutes there's no reason Bosh couldn't have."
Paul Millsap should be on the list instead of Taj Gibson
"I think part of the issue is the inability to push a team into playoff territory. Even push a team out of top pick contention. They have one season in the top 10 since KAT was drafted, and it was a year they had Jimmy Butler, a still serviceable Jeff Teague, Taj Gibson, and Jamal Crawford off the bench."
he had a team with butler rose coach thibs Wiggins Taj gibson etc.  out performed by clint capella. I was so disappointed
"100% so much heart between Nate, Noah, butler, taj gibson, deng, Kirk hinrich. A real blue collar team"
Don't forget Taj Gibson
"To add insult to injury, imagine if Taj Gibson refused to report to Utah, the Jazz bought him out, he joins the Nets and wins a title.  That's what happened to Alonzo Mourning when he was traded to Toronto as part of the Vince deal, refused to report, was bought out, and later won a title with Miami."
Taj Gibson on Wade was nasty as fuck too.
"Imagine if Mitchell said get me out of here right now and they traded him for Kevin Knox,Dwayne Bacon, Taj Gibson, and 2 first round picks  That’s the Vince Carter trade"
"&gt;Jeff Teague/Andrew Wiggins/Jimmy Butler/Taj Gibson/KAT held the 3rd seed for most of the season   They went from the 3 seed to the 8 seed because Jimmy Butler got injured. They were 37-22 when Butler played and 10-13 when he didn't play. So they had a 63% win percentage when he played, which would have been the 3rd best in the west.  &gt;I don't see how D'lo/Anthony Edwards/?/Ben Simmons/KAT can do any worse  1: because the game is not played on paper. If you think D'lo/Edwards/?/Simmons/KAT can compete for a 3 seed, then why couldn't D'lo/Edwards/Beasley/McDaniels/KAT compete for anything last year?  2: because Jimmy butler is a better floor raiser than any of KAT, Simmons, etc. Already showed the wolves record with/without him &amp; the heat in his 2 seasons are 71-39 when he plays 13-22 when he's out."
Jeff Teague/Andrew Wiggins/Jimmy Butler/Taj Gibson/KAT   held the 3rd seed for most of the season so I don't see how  D'lo/Anthony Edwards/?/Ben Simmons/KAT can do any worse lol.
"It's not even a hard argument either.  **Offense**: Both are about even scorers, Valanciunas averaged 2ppg less but played about 4 mpg less. JV was a lot more efficient (61 v 48 eFG%) and shot 37% from 3, while Ja shot 30% on nearly 4 attempts a game. Ja is obviously the better facilitator. Per36 JV was averaging 22 &amp; 16! When JV was on the court Memphis was a top tier offensive team and posted a 126 ORTG. Ja was at 108.  **Defense:** Neither is an elite defender, JV gets exposed a bit more due to his position and lack of defending the switch. JV is an elite rebounder and great at boxing out though. Defenders shot on average 6% less at the rim when JV was defending, better than Dwight Howard, Taj Gibson, WCS and Mitchell Robinson.  **Advanced:** Almost every single advanced stat paints JV as a much more impactful player than Ja. JV has fringe all star level advanced stats, while Ja has role player advanced stats (WS, WS/48, VORP, BPM, PER, TS%, Net RTG, +/-).   I think Ja obviously has more potential and room to grow, while JV is probably around his peak, but I think JV at this stage in their careers was Memphis' more impactful player, while Ja was their vocal leader and star."
I’m sorry but does anybody not like taj gibson? Every team he’s been on he’s given 100% and just maintains a positive energy even when the team sucks. Him being from Red Hook and doing all sorts of community events is just another reason why he’s so beloved by knicks fans.
Taj Gibson seems to want to be remembered more as a Knick than as a Bull. Both fanbases love him though.
Embiid is a much bigger threat inside than outside so most teams are willing to give up that shot. The opposite is true with KAT. Also the best PF KAT has played with is Taj Gibson and KGs final season
"Okey, let's break it down.  First, he's going to be 33 when the All-Star break starts. For most players when you hit your 30s the decline starts even if you were healthy. IT after his hip injury was never the same player.   Second, after his injuries he's like a 10-13 PPG on an average efficiency at best which wouldn't be that bad if he wasn't maybe the worst defensive player in the NBA. If you score 13 points but your opponent scores 17 points while you are on floor that's a negative 4 points that you provide for your team.  Third, for a young team there's no point in playing IT when you rather see and develop your young players. For contending teams he's not good enough to be on that team. For the middle of the road teams, he provides also 0 value both in trying to win games and in value for maybe trading IT if he's good enough.  Fourth, he doesn't provide any veteran leadership. IT wants to play and he thinks he's better than he really is which there is nothing wrong in having confidence in your skills, but as a person no one really mentioned IT as a guy you would really want in your locker room.  Overall, what you get from IT is negative value on the floor, if he's really healthy then basically his offense negates his defence which is 0 value. He doesn't bring anything to the locker room, so your team doesn't get any morale boost like you get from someone like Jared Dudley, Haslem or Taj Gibson. You don't get any trade value from him."
"Flynn, Harden, LeBron, Bosh, Gibson.   I know nothing about the bottom tier players but im expecting them to be complete ass by OPs other comments. If thats the case, i would rather have my most liable position be pg. I can hide him on defense and have Harden and LeBron handle the playmaking. All i need from my center is good defense so gimme Taj. None of them are really spacing the floor anyways. Then bosh is about perfect for a 3rd option at the 4."
PG - Jonny Flynn ($1)  SG - Michael Jordan ($5)  SF - Kawhi Leonard ($4)  PF - Chris Bosh ($3)  C - Taj Gibson ($2)
Michael Jordan 5  Kawhi leonard 4  Chauncey Billups 3  Taj Gibson 2   Anthony bennett 1
Yeah it puts it into perspective. The Lakers best FA signings were Shaq and Lebron. The best ever Timberwolves signings were Kevin Martin and Taj Gibson.
"I would take Rose. He played defense for 1. They won more games with Taj Gibson, Joekim Noah,Mike Dunlevey, and Luol Deng than the Heatles. Most of which were injured during the season. They had 60 wins. People forget just how good he was. He is that generations Grant Hill. Don’t get me wrong, I love Dame. Watching him break James Hardins heart makes me happy. He is ice cold clutch and extremely fun to watch, but prime preinjured Rose was playing another sport. He could literally do anything he wanted…..except guard Lebron. The only guard I have seen give Lebron trouble is early 2010s Rondo picking him up at half court."
TAJ GIBSON
"He's statistically the greatest shooting big man of all time. He has all the talent in the world, but the Wolves have failed to build a competent team around him. He needs to be paired with a big defensive 4. People forget that when he had Taj Gibson next to him and Jimmy Butler locking down the perimeter the Wolves were the 3-seed in the West into March. It's a big reason the Wolves are so fixated on Ben Simmons."
"Derrick Rose, Ronnie Brewer, Luol Deng, Taj Gibson, Joakim Noah  🥺🥺🥺  my favorite Bulls squad, and I watched Jordan live"
Taj Gibson can do whatever the fuck he wants.   He’s Taj fucking Gibson
"the last year he was healthy, they won 36 games where the leaders in games started were: Andrew Wiggins (at his worst arguably), Taj Gibson, Josh Okogie, Jeff Teague, Dario Saric, and Tyus Jones.   he was +11 in on/off last year.   the growth in his passing is what has prompted me to believe this really. i really think he is in a tier of his own after Jokic. KAT can do just about everything at a high level on the offensive end"
"Taj Gibson, basically a teddy bear https://youtu.be/pKC9YGtBHd4"
i would like ayton for taj gibson and nerlens noel  what do you mean the suns have rejected my offer  *turns 'force trade' on*
Lmao rose never reach his hypothetical peak. And Noah is still a beast and in mvp conversation. Not to mention quality role player like taj Gibson. Definitely could beat the heat if all of them healthy. I wouldn't say it's certain thing but it's not impossible considering wade drop off in his 3rd year heatles.
"Taj Gibson mentioned that when he was in high school, he saw Mike Dunleavy riding the subway alone.   &gt; “You don’t really see NBA players on the train, especially at night,” Gibson said in early January. “That’s how gangster he was.”"
"The Bulls traded Doug McDermott and Taj Gibson for Cameron Payne, who proceeded to play some of the worst basketball you have ever seen. Payne looked like what you would imagine a random guy getting picked off the street to play in the NBA. He literally, multiple times, fell down while bringing the ball up the court. I'm glad he has put it more together with the Suns, but it was one of the worst trades I have ever seen. I'm glad we have new management!"
Yeah he was literally unplayable in the 4th quarter. Thank god we had Taj Gibson who was like the anti-Boozer.
"Cameron Payne and Joffrey Lauvergne for Taj Gibson, Dougie McBuckets and a second rounder. It was daylight robbery"
"Okc sends Anthony Morrow, Joffrey Lauvergne and Cameron Payne (when he was terrible, and Chicago personnel later said he shouldn’t be in the NBA)  Chicago sends Taj Gibson, Doug McDermott and a 2nd round pick"
Most surprising thing about this clip is Taj Gibson still being in the league.
Taj Gibson and 2 2nds. Take it or leave it
How is Taj Gibson getting minutes over Toppin.
Taj Gibson Joakim Noah &amp; Jimmy Butler all developed under Thibs so this is extremely false.
"Doubtful award winner only because that award tends to go to instant offense players like Jamal Crawford even if they play no defense. Defensive stalwarts like Taj Gibson are sometimes in the running, but rarely ever win.  https://www.nba.com/bulls/news/taj-gibson-falls-just-short-kia-nba-sixth-man.html"
If I saw coach Thibs smile at me like that I’d assume Taj Gibson or Joakim Noah were about to appear out of nowhere to stab me
"I mean, let's be real, Taj Gibson is better than Schayes ever was, and Boban would probably be Wilt level iconic if he'd played in the 50's and 60's. Luke Kennard would work Pete Maravich. Talent/skill/training nowadays is just at such a higher level.   The old guys gotta get their respect for their era though"
"From his rookie season through 2018, he was very much on the same level as those guys.    17/18 they were a top 4 seed in the west for much of the year, falling to the 8 seed when Butler gets injured. KAT was the best player on that team, and no one was voicing any concerns about him being a winning player at that time. The Wolves have a top 3 offense, largely because of Towns.   18/19 they have the Butler/Thibs fiasco. They get a terrible return for Butler, and the team sucks because the roster is bad. KAT still puts up 24/12 on 50/40/80 splits. A team starting washed Jeff Teague, Wiggins, and Taj Gibson with no bench has an above average offense, almost entirely because of Towns. The defense is the same as the year before. The team is pretty bad, but I don't think that can really be blamed on Towns, given the roster surrounding him.   19/20, KAT misses the majority of the season. The team is putrid in his absence. In the 35 games he plays, he posts 26/11/4.5 on his usual efficiency.    20/21, KAT misses ~20 games to start the season, the team is putrid in his absence. He doesn't look quite right for much of the year, likely due to all the shit he endured in the previous ~12 months. The team is generally unhealthy, but shows some flashes of promise when the key players are all healthy.   This year, KAT looks healthy, engaged, and has a decent roster surrounding him. I think this year will prove a lot about his value. I think he can have a similar offensive impact as Jokic, but we'll have to see that happen."
He didn't stick with us because Thibs didn't want to play a PF that wasn't Taj Gibson. Thibs never found a way to use Bjellica's individual strengths and kept asking him to do things that didn't fit his play style.
You hype for the season opener tomorrow? We’re about to ball out this season.  Also I fucking love Taj Gibson lol
Taj Gibson will soon be the oldest player in the nba
Next Taj Gibson?
"Shit, I would hope the Knicks. Cut Mitch's injury prone minutes and get ready for Taj Gibson to retire"
"2001 Lakers   Fisher - George Hill  Kobe - Honestly cant think of a comp for young Kobe. If LaVine was also all defensive hes probably closest.   Fox - Joe Ingles   Grant -Taj Gibson maybe  Shaq - Giannis, Embiid is closer to the body type but he takes even more jumpers than AD"
"Also Jrue, Danny Green, Patty Mills, Patrick Beverly, Taj Gibson, Jennings, Rubio and a ton of other great role players"
Taj Gibson. He provides leadership and is always hustling which is contagious to the rest of our guys.
Taj Gibson
"Knicks- **Taj Gibson** aka Hard Hat or Lunch Pale   Taj is the vet on the squad, prolly the best 3rd string C in the league and he NY born.  love this dude!"
"Umm Taj Gibson,  jimmy butler,  tony snell,  and James Johnson are some late round gems that disagree.  Just admit you’re  biased against him due to him having a bad stint in Minny.  But let’s be fucking fair,  your organization is ass and your stars were soft as shit.  The jimmy butler trade would have worked if KAT wasn’t a bitch and Wiggins a lazy fraud"
Taj Gibson win MIP
Probably Joakim Noah or Taj Gibson
"You’re right , being the highest scoring playoff performer in the last thirty years is pathetic. Anyone could score more than Jordan in the playoffs, they just don’t wanna   He should have given more shots to umm…  *checks notes* uhh.. taj Gibson , Raymond Felton, and Andre Roberson"
"I can’t believe someone typed that list of names and didn’t realize they were making the opposite point than they were trying to. Terrell Brandon, Wally and Joe Smith? In 15 years people are going to say the same about KAT lol. You’re telling me he won nothing with Deangelo Russell, Jeff Teague, Andrew Wiggins, Jamal Crawford, Dario Saric and Taj Gibson? Had to be a bum."
Scoring Machine Taj Gibson
Only Thibs would play Taj Gibson and Derrick Rose 30+ minutes in a 2021 preseason game.
Taj Gibson
Taj Gibson hit a 3
Taj Gibson
"Top comment beat me to it but taj Gibson is one that comes to mind. Great teammate, plays hard, and contributes"
"Raja Bell, Korver, Taj Gibson"
"Idk, it was a big reason tbh, Noel was hurt himself, so we had to send out old man Taj Gibson for legit mins, like I said I'm not saying we win but it would have made  a legit difference. Not even on defense but offense as well, Noel offered zero on the offensive end, Mitch is a great lob threat at least"
"I think you and I have different ideas of what pritchards ceiling is. Definitely 6moty potential and probably a starter a couple years. I’d also urge you to look at the history of the 26th pick. The best 4 guys are Kevin Martin, vlade divac, taj Gibson and George hill. So yes, relative to the position he was chosen, a player who could get minutes on practically every team in the league right now is incredible value."
"Yep I love it. All the Big men are straight up haters.   Joel hates Drummond, KAT, Gobert, john Collins  Gobert hates Jokic, Embiid, KAT  Jokic hates KAT, DAJ, Taj Gibson, Gobert"
Taj Gibson?
taj gibson easily
"Not to mention that was probably one of the worst lineups for spacing in this era ever.  Roberson, Adams, Taj Gibson...  Luka has the luxury of having a 5 out lineup."
Thibs Let D Rose and Taj Gibson run a train on his wife.
"Taj Gibson will always have a spot in this league as long as Thibs is a HC, that's not to say he's not a productive player tho, he can absolutely still contribute"
Taj Gibson same age as Lebron
and Taj Gibson
This is hilarious. I'd like to imagine Taj Gibson would also make Direct Eye contact with Kemba every single time while saying this.
"Thibs uses him the same way he used Taj Gibson back in Chicago. Sure, Carlos Boozer started over him, but Taj Gibson was the closer and played the important possessions. He was less of a 6th man and more of a 5.5 man. Rose is getting the same treatments. He’s the lead guard for all the play action that matters the most."
"That's just what vets do.  LMA and Blake do it a ton.  Taj Gibson is one of the best at that, Noel did it a ton this game too."
Shit all over you in the playoffs. Gj winning without 3 of our best 4 wings though I guess. The corpse of Lemba Walker and Taj Gibson are totally equivalent lol. Delusional New Yorkers man.
"Knicks were without D rose, Taj Gibson, Nerlens Noel, and Kemba walker. Excuses are lame"
"Thibs handling of the PG position was weird. Rubio, Butler, Taj Gibson - that's the start of a really nice defensive core.     For the coup de gras he drafts Kris Dunn and Josh Okogie - two of the very few perimeter guys in the league with less offensive punch than Rubio."
Fuck GarPax  Those 2 incompetent wankers also traded away Taj Gibson for a bunch of useless garbage
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
"At the start of the pandemic when the Ringer was doing their redrafts, I was bored and did my own along with them. For the top 14 I think the redraft order is:  Steph Curry James Harden Blake Griffin Jrue Holiday DeMar DeRozan Ricky Rubio Danny Green Jeff Teague Patrick Beverley Taj Gibson Wes Matthews Patty Mills Darren Collison  Tyreke Evans of course has a good argument, but so much of his post rookie career was a let down. Also maybe Ingles goes ahead of Collison now that he retired early."
Taj Gibson was the only notable guy from this draft really.
[Wade getting dunked on by Taj Gibson](https://youtu.be/VTq8p2mjiZA) + bonus putback
If 5 years ago you’d told me teams would still be excited for Taj Gibson I don’t think I would believe you
"Fair enough  Less Randle ISO when he’s with the bench, their entire MO is running and gunning and when he’s with them it ruins everything they do that helps us  Less Kemba, More IQ and Rose  Give the minutes you’re taking from Kemba to Grimes, if we can run 10 man rotations we can make it 11 and give Grimes 7-8 minutes per game  More Taj Gibson when he’s healthy, he’s our best player in every single hustle stat and it makes everyone on the team better  Give Burks more run with the starting 5 when RJ or Fournier aren’t hitting their shots  We’re at the point in the season where Thibs needs to have a quick hook. With this team’s momentum, any win OR loss can send us to the moon or into a free fall."
"Knicks beat the Lakers without an MVP, a holder of an all time field goal percentage season record, and Taj Gibson"
"Knicks beat the Lakers without an MVP, a holder of an all time field goal percentage season record, and Taj Gibson"
"Knicks beat the Lakers without an MVP, a holder of an all time field goal percentage season record, and Taj Gibson"
"D Rose and Taj Gibson are the only true loves of Thibs' life. No one else can compare, not even Kate Upton"
I still remember when he tripped Taj Gibson in the Chicago series and there was no call
"Last year he had 7 boards in 24 minutes which is pretty good though? Watching him last year, he was very good. he was shooting 40% from 3, pnr and transition machine and a really good weakside rim protector.   Being sixth man caliber has never been about having a well-rounded game btw lol. Jamal Crawford and Lou Will weren’t winning sixth mans over guys like Igoudala and Taj Gibson because of how well rounded their game was…"
"all I'm gonna say is that if we lose this game, everyone on the Knicks (minus Derrick Rose and Taj Gibson) will need to require more than just security to leave the arena safely, it'll become more than a bloodbath here 🤣"
"yeah this exactly   heinrich, taj gibson, noah, nazr, all those dudes were willing to give everything to the team. deng literally had a spinal tap   call me speedhawk, but that’s such a shitty teammate. gotta match that energy"
"he almost did after getting traded by the Cavs and then waived by the Jazz until Thibs (and Taj Gibson) when he was in Minnesota signed D Rose and basically revived his career again. D Rose was already appreciative of what Thibs had done for him in Chicago but probably appreciated him even more in Minnesota for giving him a chance, and probably a reason why we were able to keep him this offseason"
"When Rose, IQ, and Toppin are on the floor together there's a winning pace and energy. I'd have them start with Randle and Taj Gibson.   Weird lineup I know but imagine having Kemba and RJ coming off the bench, that rotation would give a lot of teams trouble IMO."
"Taj Gibson, defended 5 players that sequence. He's a  major contributor to winning this game, +22 in the +/- the highest in the team. Props to the Knicks defensive bigs, it might not show on the stats, but they're beasts in there"
Taj Gibson better then everyone mentioned sadly
I cant tell if I should be thrilled or concerned that we won this game because of a virtuoso taj gibson defensive performance
"Taj Gibson absolutely has to be in the rotation, even after Mitch and Noel are healthy   The guy does all of the little things that nobody else will do. He is the garbage man. No Taj = No W tonight"
"I can still love Pooh and Taj-wu and root against the rest of the Knicks franchise and fanbase.  I don't see those as completely mutually exclusive concepts.  I want Rose and Gibson to do well, and the Knicks franchise to crash and burn."
"I didn't think Taj Gibson was washed, however I did not think he'd be this impactful on the Knicks over the last three seasons. After 2019 I thought he'd just retire after playing for his hometown team. Got one last good contract, solid vet presence for a younger Mitchell Robinson. Then the lockout cut the season short and most figured that'd be it for Taj.  Unfortunately Mitchell Robinson and Nerlens Noel are made of glass, so we brought him back in 2020. He was holding it down, taking on an awesome second center off the bench role after Nerlens took over as a starter...or starting himself whenever Nerlens would inevitably get injured. Taj was still playing so well despite an eye injury that he was dubbed ""Taj-1000"" after the Terminator for his domination in the paint and putback prowess.  This season, because Mitch and Nerlens continue to find ways to get injured, Taj is still getting worthwhile minutes and being an overall positive off the bench and sometimes even starting. I don't think most people expected Taj to be getting this much playtime this late in his career, but overall he's been a solid and most importantly **available** center in our rotation. Great way to potentially end a career playing for your hometown."
If we have taj gibson and nerlens Noel willing to shoot 3s and Ben doesn’t I’ll take him off the court myself for being a pussy.

Taj Gibson is a big physical man and that's all I gotta say about that
"&amp;#x200B;  The Bulls were the 11th offense and the Magic the 14th offense.  Both teams won because of defense, one team had Jooks Noah, Taj Gibson, Luol Deng, Ronnie Brewer, Omer Asik and Keith Bogans playing mins. The other had Dwight Howard and...I guess Quentin Richardson was fine and so was Brandon Bass lol.  Dwight had has good as a net rating as Rose (8,4 vs 8,8) on a much worse teams ?"
Post his dirty plays. One guy tried and deleted his comments because he has one dirty ish foul in his career. He plays gritty but not more than Taj Gibson or any other “enforcer”. He’s not Marcus who you all hate for picking on poor Luka.   He was hurt dumbass. Jokic even said after the game he felt bad because it was obvious his neck snapped back.   If that’s a cheap shot the leagues in trouble. They happen a lot. If guys are gonna start hurting each other for those we’re gonna have to get used to watching backups.    Jokic has proven his temper gets the best of him repeatedly. He needs to cool it. He’s gonna hurt someone worse than this and it’s embarrassing
"Over Obi Toppin and Taj Gibson, mind you.  Mitchell Robinson was out, Taj Gibson playing hurt.  Impressive nonetheless"
He also didn’t mention the impact of Taj Gibson so I can’t see ur point
rebounding over obi toppin &amp; taj gibson
Taj Gibson is a certified superstar.
if taj Gibson is getting and 1s on jump shots its a wrap
Taj Gibson &gt;&gt;&gt; Prime Hakeem
"Agreed, and I think this is going to reach a head quicker than people realize because all the veterans (age wise) who are mostly the core of this team do not really bring veteran intangibles and in some cases bring negative ones. I just don't see the Wolves gaining any traction with this current roster because of this. It seems to me that something significant needs to happen, bringing in vets like Taj Gibson, Ricky Rubio, Pat Bev clearly hasn't worked."
Taj Gibson would like a word Blake.   #Bull4ever
Knicks  prolly Alec Burks / Taj Gibson
"About your first point - I agree, but as you see all the teams, especially from small markets, trying to max their players on rookie contracts one year prior to the end of their contract, mostly because they want to keep good relationship with agents and not to get 3+1 player option (with kickers and half of the salary paid before the season) offer from other teams. Basically what happened with Gordon Hayward in Utah. Thibs as a GM was reluctant to do so, but the owner insisted. It was an obvious mistake, that eventually lead to Butler leaving.  About the second point I can agree. The fans have problems with Butler due to the actions he did to force his way out, but I can partially understand him. All the fans who think that Minnesota is soft and Butler did everything right have to understand that literally nothing good happened with the team for a long time. We gave up a lot to get Butler and the hopes were high af with potential trio of Towns-Wiggins-Butler and signing of best free agents in Wolves history aka Jeff Teague and Taj Gibson (yeah we never sign anyone). Miami can just sign Lebron without giving up anything, even now every single season they sign great FA for nothing, this season they gave up okay sophomore for Lowry and nothing for PJ. Timberwolves cannot sing even Dlo in free agency, had to trade 7th pick for him."
"**Knicks**  **Immanuel Quickly:** IQ, Jesus’ Son  **Derrick Rose:** D Rose, Windy City D, Pooh, Every Rose has it thorn  **Julius Randle:** Beyblade, Big Julius, Don Julio, Orange (&amp;Blue) Julius, Randle wit da Handle,   **Taj Gibson:** Hard Hat, Lunch Pail, Taj Gibson  **Kemba Walker:** K Walk, MJs Son  **RJ Barrett:** Baby Face Barrett, Hesi-Step-back-pull-up-Maple, StarJ,   **Alec Burks:** Alec Tre-Bruk,   **Obi Toppin:** Obi Wan,   **Evan Fournier:** French Phenom, French Toasty,"
"I mean Cam Payne (before his rookie contract was up) was traded for Taj Gibson, Doug mcbuckets and a 2nd round pick (I believe it became Mitchell Robinson). OKC then traded Kanter, Mcbuckets, and the 2nd pick for Carmelo Anthony. They then traded Anthony and a top 14 2022 protected pick for Dennis Schroeder. Dennis then got shipped to the Lakers for Danny Green, a first that became Jaden McDaniels I believe. OKC then packaged that pick to Minasota for pick 16 of the 2020 NBA draft to pick none other than Aleksej Pokusevski. So in the end I think the Thunder got their guy!  Also, at least Cameron Payne figured it out and is a role player in the NBA.  A D.  On your report carddoesn't bring your GPA down to a 1.0 if you have all A's."
Taj Gibson was so close to having a Snell of a night.
Alright I'm just going to come out and say it.  Taj Gibson should have won MVP in 2017 and 2018.
"He’s been that dude since coming into the league. Gibson has been good enough to start on a team since he was a rookie. Back in the Bulls everyone in the fandom was screaming for us to dump Boozer and make Taj our starting PF.   But Taj himself never complained. Never a hint of displeasure at being a guy off the bench. Never a bad word about anything to exit his mouth. People joke about the “hard hat and lunch pail” mentality, but that’s straight up Taj. He punches the clock, works hard, zero drama, gives you 100% every time. Every team he plays for love the dude."
"Sir, we have Taj Gibson."
Taj Gibson is in 1st and everyone else is just fighting for 2nd
Bulls Legend Taj Gibson
"I would literally lay down my life for Taj Gibson, even if it were completely unnecessary"
"I love Taj Gibson, proud to own this man’s jersey"
He sure does Mr. NOT Taj Gibson * *wink* *
I'm sorry no way was it Ginobli in 2014 it was Taj Gibson but voters couldn't give two shits about defense off the bench.
Ask Taj Gibson - the dude attempted to block a shot with his shoe
[Taj Gibson](https://twitter.com/SportsCenter/status/1074844769799540736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1074844769799540736%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.celticslife.com%2F2018%2F12%2Fis-it-legal-to-block-shot-with-shoe-taj.html)
I don't believe none of them should get traded and I agree that Beal isn't a good fit. I think they just need more veterans than young players on the team like a Taj Gibson or PJ tucker because Brown and Tatum are too chill to be leaders.
Taj mfing Gibson can do whatever he wants
"taj mfing gibson fouled jok, I'll take it to my grave"
"fear not, evan fournier and taj gibson will combine for 100 against us  you decide how much they each go for"
but yo also Taj Gibson is no slouch either
Great bench listed and doesn’t mention the almighty muscle and hustle of Taj Gibson
I mean we have Taj Gibson.. everyone else just needs to wait the Taj era out.
Taj Gibson is 36 years old
"How is it false?   Derrick Rose ($5.5 million), Joakim Noah ($3.1 million), Taj Gibson ($1.2 million). That's a total of $9.8 million in salary.  Mike Miller ($5 million) and Udonis Haslem ($3.5 million) is $8.5 million.  They would have had to take $433,000 less each on their first year to go to Chicago instead.  The Bulls needed to create cap space for the third guy, but even GarPax probably isn't too incompetent to move a 25-year old Luol Deng and a 2nd year James Johnson to get there."
"Would anyone get injured? Assuming they keep their draft pick in 2011 and draft BPA, their lineup eventually would have included:  Derrick Rose, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, Chris Bosh, Joakim Noah, Jimmy Butler, Taj Gibson, and Nate Robinson. Winning would be so easy for that group that they could rest guys when they have minor injuries and blowouts would be so common that guys wouldn't need to play heavy minutes.  And when three of your allstars are injured, you still have 3 more + Taj."
How fucking old is taj gibson
"There’s on guy who the Bulls used to play like this, Joakim Noah. He was super good at it and had Taj Gibson at the rim to help if he actually did get beat. It used to give offenses fits."
This can’t be serious. I wouldn’t trade Taj Gibson for KP.
"This is before Dipo was good. Wiggins this year is far better than Dipo was in '17. Just for reference, the starting lineup of the thunder was Westbrook, Dipo, Roberson, rookie Sabonis/Taj Gibson and Adams. The warriors lineup is better in about every conceivable way outside of rebounding."
"Which is weird because other than KAT, every player swears by him. Hell even Derrick Rose, a guy he supposedly ran into the ground, keeps following him wherever he coaches. Wiggins talks fondly of him. Joakim Noah. Taj Gibson. Jimmy Butler loves Thibs the coach, but wanted out of Minny over getting paid and butting heads with guys like KAT.   Again, it’s all about narratives. One star didn’t like playing for him and suddenly that means all players don’t. The guy that KAT did want as coach because he was was more “player friendly” got fired earlier this season because he sucked. By all accounts, the Knicks players love him because they’re all gym rats."
"That’s more like Taj Gibson, especially given Taj is older and an excellent mentor, also very involved socially"
"Ugh. First Mitch, now Noel. Guess Taj Gibson is going to be playing 40 mins a game for a playoff team."
Both Nerlens Noel and Taj Gibson have over-achieved in this system. Both have come up big when they're needed. I just hope they can stay healthy...
"Taj Gibson is also too old to be playing this well (considering his minutes and position). Once you're a Thibs guy, seems like you're always a Thibs guy."
I once saw Thibs play Taj Gibson 72 mins.. and there wasn’t even an OT.. no idea how he did it.
If he can bring Taj Gibson I’ll co-sign.
"Taj Gibson always looked 35 to me, even like a decade ago when he was on the Bulls"
Malcolm Brogdon is a year older than Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and the same age as Bismack Biyombo  Taj Gibson is older than Dwight Howard
Taj Gibson and LeBron are only half a year apart
"At least you got a first from us for him. You drafted Jusuf Nurkić and traded him(with Gary Harris) for Doug McDermott. You then traded McDermott, Taj Gibson, and a second(Mitchell Robinson) for Joffrey Lauvergne, Anthony Morrow and Cameron Payne. All those guys left the team that offseason."
Taj Gibson hit a full court shot yesterday but I wouldn't call him a sharpshooter. Hitting one game winner against the grizzlies in the regular season after Grayson Allen misses 2 FTs doesn't make Luka a clutch player
Taj Gibson hit a full court shot yesterday but I wouldn't call him a sharpshooter. Imagine hitting one game winner against the grizzlies in the regular season after Grayson Allen misses 2 FTs and calling yourself a clutch player for it

Julius Randle. Obviously he is because he’s the second best player on the team behind Taj “the Goat” Gibson
"Nerlens, Taj Gibson"
"Main things is a night and day difference in the MIP recipient Julius Randle. His play has ignited others to play well too. Can't discount the acquisition of the savy vet D.Rose. When he's on the floor you can see how well the offense moves and he sets up others really well. I knew Coach Thibs would need a least a year with the new team to build up their defense and play in his system. D.Rose already played under him so adding him along with Taj Gibson was easy. Also, the rook Quickley played out of his mind earlier in the season. If they add a few key pieces in the offseason, they'll for sure be in the playoff mix next year."
Imagine complaining to the NBA head office that 48 year-old Taj Gibson is beating you up lmao
Don’t worry we have had to watch Taj Gibson play Left Tackle
No but I’ll start. How long will it take for the Taj Gibson statue outside of MSG to be built?
"I remember Boozer was a face-up post player. Now I don't think taj was much of a post player, his best skills were his defense and hustle. So I agree that the comment you're replying to is wrong, but that's cuz Gibson don't recall Gibson playing the post much."
I really wish the Knicks would just switch Taj Gibson on to Trae every possession and live with the results. Trae has to deal with the butcher trapping him at 3/4 court lol tough life.
Wait you’re telling me Taj Gibson is only a year young then LeBron. Yet Taj came into the league 6 years after LeBron was drafted… wtf
Taj mother Effin Gibson
I’m sorry that you’re not a fan of Taj Gibson.
Who would’ve thought D Rose and Taj Gibson would be leading a team to a playoff win in the year 2021 😂
Man Taj Gibson really looks handsome with that hat on! The arc of his eyebrows mirrors that properly bent brim! The NBA is teeming with hotties!
Taj Gibson = GOAT
Apparently Taj Gibson is the first to ever wear 67.
"Let me  rephrase. Taj Gibson setting “legal screens”, and this effort from the Knicks on defense isn’t good for full health.....  Especially since it seems they’ll be in desperation and maybe out of control trying to come back. It’ll could be  a sweep but Brooklyn might not escape unscathed because of how they have to work for it"
Taj Gibson has been 35 for a whole decade
Taj has been bringing it. Wish he could play every minute because the defense feels like it takes such a hit with Noel on the court and Gibson not out there hustling
I think Taj Gibson is only bested by Derek Jeter in all time NYC athletes.
Taj Gibson and D Rose turning back the clock!
Only way to explain taj Gibson last two games
Taj Gibson will fundamental the FUCK out of you
I would argue that Taj Gibson is probably the most important player in the series so far for the knicks
We’re gonna have to target Taj Gibson at this rate 😂😂 or D Rose god forbid
Taj MF Gibson too. Guy turned back the clock tonight
Taj Gibson!!!!!!!!!!!
"Taj Gibson, the plus/minus god"
"Imagine if 18 months ago I told you that Julius Randle, Reggie Bullock, Taj Gibson, Derrick Rose, and Alec Burks would lead the Knicks to a playoff win. With help from a wing playing from Dayton and Nerlens Noel."
"Taj - 6-7-1-3-1 on 0 TOs and 1 PF, team high +23. Derrick Rose was on fire tonight, but Taj Gibson was absolutely the unsung MVP for us tonight.   Great game Hawks. Trae looked unstoppable and I'm expecting his revenge tour in game 3, shaping up to be a hell of a series."
"Rose's a bully. ROSE'S A FUCKING BULLY! ALL YOU FUCKIN KNICK HATERS? SUCK MY DICK! WATCH AND LEARN. WE GOT A NEW TEAM NI🅱️🅱️A. ALL THAT SHIT Y'ALL WAS TALKING ABOUT WE GONNA GET SWEPT?

Taj Gibson balled out. So many clutch offensive rebounds down the stretch.
Taj Gibson was huge in the clutch
TAJ GIBSON IS THE BEST NBA GRANDPA OF ALL TIME
"Taj Gibson and clutch dunks to hype the crowd, what a sight to behold 🥲"
Watching D Rose and Taj Gibson close out a playoff win with Thibs at the helm sure does bring a smile to my face
Taj Gibson would beat up your uncle at the YMCA
TAJ GIBSON IS A MAN AMONG BOYS
Taj Gibson would beat up your uncle at the YMCA
What an absolutely phenomenal performance from Taj Gibson
TAJ GIBSON! 3 clutch OREB's this quarter.  THIBS BELIEVED!
Taj Gibson is the fucking GOAT
Taj Gibson balling out...WHAT YEAR IS IT?
+23 for the legend Taj motherfucking Gibson
"Taj Gibson is timeless.  Trae is fucking great, but forgot for a second that he isn't Curry."
Taj Gibson is a top 15 Center and currently in his prime.
Taj Gibson has been great today.
TAJ GIBSON PLAYING OUT OF HIS FUCKING MIND!!
Atlanta forgot how to shoot lmao and taj Gibson kinda nice
Taj Gibson does two things 1. Rebound 2. Dunk and he does them so well
"I really cant believe Taj Gibson, in 2021, is closing games for a team with home court advantage in the playoffs"
TAJ GIBSON
Taj Gibson gotta be 45 years old man
Taj Gibson has played dirty for most of the game. So has Noel and obviously Reggie Bullock who got a flagrant for his dirty play
How long the refs gonna continue to let Taj Gibson be Penei Sewell?
Bro I still can't believe taj Gibson is in the league
I see Taj Gibson is still allowed to play a linebacker on the basketball court.
Taj gibson acting like a damn offensive lineman in those highlights
35 year old Taj Gibson is yo leader ay
"You mean to tell me that trotting out Obi Toppin, Taj Gibson, Immanuel Quickley, and Nerlens Noel will lead to incompetent offense? Damn that's so crazy who could have seen this coming?"
"Taj Gibson is a walking foul, honestly smart by him, set the standard of physical play and refs won’t call it everytime"
Taj Gibson is absolutely gassed lol. Mans is playing his heart out tonight.
Either Taj Gibson has the upper body strength of a newborn kitten or that was an acting job.
"What kind of offensive scheme is this? Randle goes baseline, takes two steps and runs right into Taj Gibson lmao"
Julius Randle looks completely out of his element.   Why force a baseline drive on top of a posted up Taj Gibson?
At least Knicks have great hair (minus Taj Gibson)
Taj Gibson starting where he left off
"He doesn’t live rent free. He’s the best player on a team we’re  facing in the playoffs. Deblasio I get, but trae is paying the rent of facing our team in the playoffs.    Is Taj Gibson living in your head rent free because of all the O-lineman jokes I see?"
We have a D rose and a Taj Gibson with loads of playoff experience
Taj Gibson will die so we can get that dub. He will be remembered as a hero.
"Lol yes Trae gets the calls because the league likes him more? Tf?  The league must fucking love Taj Gibson then for not calling a single foul on him for his ""screens"" dude was blocking like Orlando Pace out there"
Trae will stop hunting for fouls as soon as Taj Gibson stops playing like an offensive lineman
"&gt;RJ/KCP/Tobias/Marcus Morris/Andre  I can't believe you threw this out there as a lineup he should have gotten more from. The fact he got this line up to the playoffs is an accomplishment in and of itself. You expect a Detroit team with no 20ppg scorers, no allstars, no notable defenders, and no notable depth to win a playoff seriers? This team made it over      \- a young Wiz with John Wall, Bradley Beal, Otto Porter, Markief Morris, and Marcin Gortat   \- the Bulls with Derrick Rose-Jimmy Butler-Taj Gibson-Nikola Mirotic     And that detroit roster only got worse every year.     What is there to defend? The Pelicans best player is 20 and has played 1 season of NBA basketball. Literally. 85 games. Did I say this year was a success? No i didn't say that anywhere. They underperformed, they underperformed by 3-4 wins."
i can’t even process the fact i’m reading Taj Gibson slander rn
did Taj Gibson die?
Taj “the human moving screen” Gibson  Guy was pulling that shit all game
"Taj gibson doesnt have the heart to step over a shoe, not a winning player, not a winning team. Sad. Thats not basketball, Taj."
"well the only reason that John Collins lost his shoe is Taj Gibson tackling him. Or like JC put it himself: [""Shoe off I didn't give a fuck""](https://streamable.com/vgtv4z)"
he should tell alec burks that too.   also tell taj gibson he's a center in the nba not the nfl.
"They’ve been letting dudes get away with some crazy screens so far in the games I’ve watched. Y’all’s game, taj Gibson in ours. Like what are these refs even watching"
I vaguely remember Taj Gibson getting one in that Game 82 game. That was pretty much the last time Jokic ever got bullied
Rat move. Dellavedova did this to Taj Gibson once and I’ve always hated him
"Does anyone else remember when Matthew Dellevadova did something like this to Taj Gibson, Cavs vs. Bulls? Wish they could have reviewed that play."
Taj Gibson over Crawford too.
Clarkson deserved it but this award is becoming “Most PPG without starting”   Guys like Taj Gibson and iguodala got screwed for Jamal Crawford cuz of it   Thad young really got no recognition smh Though ingles and Rose were clearly ahead of him
If I can run Taj Gibson into my defender I'm taking that floater every single time.
"Rob Williams was our 3rd center until the Theis trade. Has Taj Gibson ever had nine blocks in a playoff game? I don't *think* so, sir."
"Take a look at this gif someone posted in r/atlantahawks of Taj Gibson on the game tying 3 pointer by Randle, and then try to tell me with a straight face that Knicks got jobbed by the refs. https://i.redd.it/kpnmxvbbd0171.gif  FYI Gibson was pulling this crap all game."
"Considering the fact that the Knicks shot more free throws and Taj Gibson became a left tackle for much of the game with no calls against him, idc :)"
Taj Gibson was blocking like a left tackle every time he set a screen and it never got called
"Did the same shit to us in game 82 a few seasons ago. MIN went to the playoffs, we went home. Fuck Taj Gibson, how do refs let him get away with so much shit when he’s never been more than a role player?"
Did Taj Gibson set a legal screen all game? Dude was playing O-line on that Randle 3. Keep telling yourself it was the refs when the game came down to a game winning made field goal.
Looks like Taj Gibson ran a screen on Frank Ntilikina allowing Trae Young path to basket ... WTF?
That nothing being Taj “Moving Screen” Gibson
"Even without the commentary is easy to spot that Ntilikina fucked up, Taj is doubling Trae from the left side and Frank had to stop him from going right, because that's effectively the only way he can get to the paint for a layup or hit the floater. If Ntilikina doesn't bite and never allows Trae to go to his dominant hand, Trae would've had to either pull up from 30 feet for a contested jumper or passed out of the double team.  Taj Gibson played it perfectly and the defensive scheme was really good aswell, but an individual mistake cost them and Trae got an easy game winner."
"Come on man, you guys shot more free throws and just look at Taj man. Like seriously, that’s an NFL lineman, look at thumbnail where Gibson has his hands. You guys very clearly got away with plenty and just want the excuse to fall on Trae"
Taj “Orlando Pace” Gibson
"You guys need to watch the game over and watch specifically Taj Gibson. I promise you will laugh your ass off cause dude was playing in the NFL, not the NBA. We have a video on our sub of a 5 second long moving screen 4 feet in front of the ref 😂😂"
"Well the Refs swallowed their whistle for 40 mins on behalf of the Knicks. Quickley got phantom call early in 4th, Capela was getting mugged all night and Taj Gibson did like 20 moving screens....so I dont feel sorry for them."
Yes. Knicks has Taj Gibson and y'all have Iggy for reference.
Taj Gibson is kind of Elite
"Maybe we need a clip of Quickley getting ""fouled"" by Lou earlier in the 4th or Capela getting mugged like 20 times or Taj Gibson doing like 15 illegal moving screens  Lol🤣🤣🤣"
"It would had helped if Frank wasnt cold. Why even sub him when he hasnt moved from the bench all game? It also would had helped if noel didnt get injured, playing with taj gibson down the stretch is bad. He cant guard the PnR"
Taj Gibson has to be one of the ugliest human beings on this planet.
"Shoutout Taj Gibson, he's been huge this game too"
Taj Gibson came this close to attempting a game tying shot in a playoff game and i just find that very inspirational
"Taj Gibson offensive rebound to a Rose floater, Tibs is a genius."
TAJ GIBSON MOTHERFUCKERS  HARD HAT. LUNCH PAIL.
Make up call for the Taj gibson moving screen on the Randle 3. Deal with it
Derrick Rose and Taj Gibson playing closing minutes of a playoff game while Thibodeau coaches in 2021. What a time to be alive.
These moving screens by Taj Gibson are just ridiculous. He might as well be an offensive lineman.
Taj Gibson with the most egregious moving screen lol
lol Taj Gibson literally just elbows up blocking Collins
Moving screen on Taj Gibson?
nah its taj gibson grabbing every miss
I want apologies for all of you slandering Taj motherfucking Gibson
What the fuck was that by TAJ Gibson
I have to admit I didn't have Taj Gibson and Nerlens Noel having meaningful play-off performances on my 2021 bingo card.
"if we win this game the reason will be taj gibson, he is doing so much for us on both ends"
"Gotta say, watching D Rose and Taj Gibson playing for Thibs in the playoffs really takes me back."
Never forget Taj Gibson insane dunk on Dwade in 2011. How has it been a decade
Bruh I love old ass taj gibson
How is Taj Gibson getting 20 mpg on a playoff team
taj gibson looking really solid out there
Taj Gibson? In the year 2021?
"If three years ago you told me that Taj Gibson would be a rotational player for a Knicks team with homecourt advantage in the playoffs, I’d have laughed in your face."
Against Chicago right? Over Taj Gibson
"Bulls fan here supporting the LEGENDS: D Rose, Thibs, and Taj fucking Gibson bby LFG KNICKS!!!"
"Drummond a defensive stopper? LOL he was never that man. People complained he had empty inflated stats with missed putbacks, which I didn't realize was that much the case. He's really not a great rebounder. I'd say Taj Gibson is a better rebounder for sure and he's not someone people think of for rebounding."
"SOO much better than this.   In his NBA seaason, Westbrook had: a young but good Oladipo, Roberson for defense, Steven Adams/Taj Gibson for interior presence, Kanter for scoring and young McDermott/Grant/Sabonis.   That's a lotta length and multiple iso scorers."
Wait till you see Taj Gibson still plays lol.
I think Taj Gibson alone may have more playoff experience than the Grizzlies.
Tillman looks like he was drafted 5 picks after Taj Gibson
How could you forget Taj Gibson bro
"The Bulls have a habit of sending their bigs out into the world to fuck shit up, we go through them so quickly. Taj Gibson, Joakim Noah, Omer Asik, Threekola Mirotic, Bobby Portis, Wendell Carter Jr., Daniel Gafford. Next in line is Lauri Markkanen."
Where’s Taj Gibson?!?
"As a Knicks fan it's been bizarre but nice to be getting all this love from the other big franchises. Seems like we've got fans from the Bulls (Thibs, D-Rose, I know some of you love Taj Gibson) and the Lakers (Julius Randle, and always being THE team in a 2 team city)"
Taj gibson
Taj Gibson and any team Thibs is coaching
Derrick Rose has fake teeth because Taj Gibson broke 9 of them when he accidentally elbowed him at practice and broke his eye socket
Thank you taj Gibson
"Rudy also plays five minutes less a game, which kinda blows that pace argument out of the water. The per36 and per100 stats are both even more biased in Rudy's favor.  The counting stats are no comparison, the advanced stats are no comparison, the eye test is no comparison. What even is the point you're trying to make? Do you think Gobert would be a better player if he took a bunch more bad shots? Rudy is just plain better than Noah was. Noah was a much better passer and had a more rounded offensive game, but his offensive game just wasn't very good. His production was on par with Taj Gibson and Tristan Thompson even in his best year. His passing was good, but great and definitely not anywhere near good enough to make the difference on offense comparable to the difference on defense."
and taj Gibson
We should try and develop him.. oh wait he's not Taj Gibson oops
I think Taj Gibson was around that age too.
"Taj was great for OKC even though he only played on the Thunder for half a season. Model professional and a great role player, Gibson ingratiates himself to fans super easily, I don't think I've ever heard a bad word about him"
I had no idea taj Gibson was still in the league. Good for him
