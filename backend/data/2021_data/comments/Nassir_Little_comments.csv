"Who would win:   CJ McCollum, Jusuf Nurkic, Derrick Jones Jr, Zach Collins, Nassir Little  vs.   Dame, GTJ, Hood(?), Covington, Kanter  With how CJ was playing, I honestly think that top team would win. Lol."
"Blazers hospital team:   CJ McCollum, Jusuf Nurkic, Derrick Jones Jr, Zach Collins, Nassir Little  Luckily Roco is back from his concussion!"
"I got faith in him, but who else would you run at the 4 on that team?  Collins is basically a big and if he's not injured then he's fouling a ton. Nassir Little is raw and undersized. Not a lot of options."

Nassir Little
"[Why yes I am a Nassir Little fan, how could you tell](https://imgur.com/a/lKMGz7N)"
Happy Nassir Little Day.
"Kevin Love, John Wall, Dreymond Green, Jrue Holiday, and Nassir Little."
"cj: foot stepped on  nurk: fell and landed on his wrist  collins: tore something in his shoulder? during a rebound against the mavs, then injured his ankle during rehab  roco: concussion when he was hit by randle during a play   (don't know exactly what happened to DJJ)  hood: rehab for his achilles, so he's been missing b2bs and they've been taking it easy with him  nassir little: caught covid, was hospitalized i think? (back now)    most of these are just being unlucky during games"
I think a team that needs a defensive big would give a bit for him. But he's old and on an expiring contract so you can't expect too much. I could see the Blazers sending over a tier 2 prospect like Nassir Little plus a 2nd round pick.
Brogdon can play the 2!  PG: Dame / Aaron Holiday / TJ McConnell  SG: Malcolm Brogdon / Gary Trent Jr. / Nassir Little   SF: DJJ / Justin Holiday / Rodney Hood  PF: RoCo / Doug McDermott / Melo  C: Sabonis / Kanter / Giles   We couldn't anchor the paint to save our lives but hey we can surround Sabonis with shooters.
"Nassir Little said he thought he was going to die. Dude was off his feet for over three weeks and lost  20 pounds.   &gt; I’m not trying to sound morbid or anything, but it was to the point where it was like, you just don’t want to feel anything. It was really that bad. You just wished it would stop. It was consistent, 24/7 … just miserable pain. My back was hurting so bad, my headaches were terrible, I couldn’t eat anything …"
Shitposting aside I still think they have enough depth to survive for the time being.  PG: Dame / Anfernee Simons   SG: Gary Trent Jr. / Nassir Little  SF: DJJ / Rodney Hood  PF: RoCo / Melo  C: Kanter / Giles  I'm kind of high on the bench but that's still a serviceable 10-man rotation. The idea of Kanter holding down the defense is frightening but he did it during the playoffs when Portland made the WCF a few years ago.  I'm excited for Giles to get some consistent minutes. Nassir Little is the weakest link in the rotation but hopefully he can step up with some consistent minutes. Gary Trent Jr. is ready to take the leap imo.
"The Blazers got murdered by injuries this year and its happening again this year. But honestly, I still think they have the depth to go further than they did last season.  PG: Dame / Anfernee Simons  SG: Gary Trent Jr. / Nassir Little   SF: DJJ / Rodney Hood  PF: RoCo / Melo  C: Kanter / Giles  I'm admittedly higher on the bench than a lot of people but I think there's decent depth through the roster and that's even with CJ, Nurk and Collins out. I'm happy to see Giles getting consistent minutes. Nassir Little is the weakest guy in the rotation but maybe he just needs the opportunity to step up."
"I wouldn't expect a whole lot but why are we giving him away? he has some value, both for teams competing for this year and for a team hoping to keep him long-term. i get that he's a flawed player but he does many things very well and would be excellent on almost any contender.  if nothing else we should be able to get a struggling young guy with higher upside. thinking like mo bamba, rodions kurucs, nassir little... just pulled those names outta my ass, not the best examples, but you get the idea."
"IM going through some of these other recent classes damn I had completely forgotten Andrew Harrison was so highly touted.   Slow Mo Kyle Anderson 3rd? Didnt realize he was that hyped coming out. Did not realize Nassir Little was top 3 level hyped either    Isaiah Austin, Marquis Teague, Josh Selby, Cliff Alexander, Cheick Diallo, Trevon Duval some top 5 guys the past decade who did the least in the NBA"
"He didn't even play Ant at all last night, and we're just loading up Dame and CJ with insane minute totals right now, Idfgi. Ant's a tricky one, because he obviously is a flawed player right now, but he needs some rope to go and learn how to play point guard for an NBA offense, make mistakes, take bumps, and improve.   I just don't know how you're ever going to be able to expect reliable contributions from your bench dudes later in the season when the games truly matter, when you're all over the place with their minute totals. Trent, Ant, Hood, on down the line. The only player who's logged consistently more than 25-30 mins night-in-night-out off the bench for us, is Melo.   Stotts has done a good job over the years nurturing and developing talent, so he earns some plaudits there, but I'm just beyond confused with our rotations this season. I think he's having some trouble managing a much deeper roster than he probably has in years past, but if I'm the Front Office, I'm getting concerned at how Derrick Jones is being used, how little consistent big minutes Ant is getting when the hope is he'll blossom into a strong enough calibur lead guard offensively, we can take some mileage off our goddamn back court. Hood was out or whatever, so he's just getting back into the rotation, will take time, sure... along with Nassir, but we have a deeper roster than what's been shown thus far, and even just replacing Melo's crunch minutes with Gary's would solve so many of our issues imo.   If Nurk is playing like ass, fuck it, go small."
Or Nassir Little?
Best part about tonight is that it's the first game Nassir Little has played this year since his rough bout with Covid.
It’s also just like a risk reduction think. It’s not an all or nothing deal. Every bit of precaution will help a little bit. It’s not like wearing masks would give them the virus. Was Nassir Little messed up by it?
Nassir Little
"No mention of the Blazers who have been playing without their 2nd and 3rd best players for most of the season? Plus another potential starter (Zach Collins) out for the season?  Blazers depth is the only reason they remain in the playoff hunt despite being the most injured team in the entire league. They will have a full 10 man rotation available again after the All Star break:  PG: Lillard, Anfernee Simons SG: CJ, Trent Jr. SF: Derrick Jones, Rodney Hood PF: Covington, Melo C: Nurkic, Kanter  And that's not including fast improving Nassir Little and out for the season Zach Collins. Little may be good enough to fight for the starting SF spot next season."
"Why doesn’t Nassir Little get more minutes? Haven’t caught many Portland games, but when I’ve checked in he’s had some efficient games in limited minutes"
Portland’s second leading scorer: Nassir Little.
"17th pick is averaging 10 ppg. That seems like a pretty average quality 17th pick.  &gt;sixth men in college don't often go in the first round.  It happens fairly regularly these days. As long as the team they are on is one of the best. Portland alone drafted two of them in recent drafts: Zach Collins (10th in 2017) and Nassir Little (25th in 2019).  &gt; do you think Donte's National Championship MVP caused him to be overvalued in the draft?  Overvalued is hard to say, but yes it definitely got him drafted higher. A month prior he was viewed as a late 1st or early 2nd, and a candidate to possibly stay in college another year."
The COVID excuses don't hold any water when compared to Portland. McCollum and Nurk and Zach Collins and Nassir Little and Rodney Hood. Portland has been the most injured team in the league.
Don’t forget our golden god Nassir Little!
"oh the lakers series that didn't have covington or djj? or nassir little? or rodney hood? or enes kanter? yeah it went pretty bad. still took 1 game, just like every other team the lakers beat on their way to a championship.   congrats on ""shredding"" portland missing their 2nd and 3rd best players, at home, and losing lmao. can't wait to watch zion leave your scrub ass city like AD did."
YES NASSIR LITTLE MINUTES
"Everyone playing to maximum potential on this roster basically.  Everyone was in pretty solid shape before season.  They only have 14 players on roster also.  Nassir Little was out for most of season also...no Zach Collins yet either.  If we have zach collins, nurk, and CJ back...we are going to be very strong team at end of season."
"Besides Dame being Dame, we've just had a ton of guys step up.  Kanter is destroying everyone on the offensive boards.  Our core of young guys are all taking steps.  Gary has turned into a good starting level player.  Anfernee is averaging 12 a game on 44% from 3 since we lost CJ.  Nassir LIttle had a 30 point game to beat the Bucks, and went 3-3 from 3 last night. Defense has been doing better.  11th best defense over the 7-1 run(played a lot of bad offenses though).    Our team as it is isn't as good as our record.  But frankly, that's not really important, because we just needed to stay afloat while we were down CJ and Nurk and we've surprassed my wildest expectations instead."
"Two of Gary Trent, Anfernee Simons, and Nassir Little improving to the point at which they're legitimately good players who can be traded as the centerpiece for the next disgruntled star is really our only hope."
"The 1st in the East sixers lost to us without lillard, CJ, Nurk, Derrick Jones jr, Zach Collins, and nassir little"
"Nurkic would need to evolve even further tbf, polish up his inside scoring and playmaking.    RoCo is a stud defender, but DJJ is not quite enough of a threat. Nassir Little is one to keep an eye on. He's started to look more  confident with the ball in his hands."
Money wise this works doubt that Cavs go for it though: Rodney Hood and Zach Collins/Nassir Little for Larry Nance. Not really a dream trade but a somewhat realistic trade I want to happen.
"Anfernee Simons, Gary Trent Jr, Nassir Little"
"&gt; No missing 5-7 guys is not the same as missing 2.  ...is this a joke?  How is that what you think is happening LOL  Nurkic, CJ, and Collins have missed a combined 47 games.    Richardson, Porzingis, DFS, Kleiber, and Powell have missed a combined 45 games.  And every single game but one we were missing not one of those guys, not two of them, but all three. Plus Nassir Little who dropped 30 his last game has missed 15 games and Roco and DJJ took turns going down while already down CJ, Nurk, and Zach.    &gt; According to on off numbers Convington is the best player on the Blazers. You see how that is probably not true?  Covington has almost the exact same onoff as Dame because he 95% of his minutes with Dame on the floor, shocker.  You see how looking at two guys on the same team sharing minutes isn't the same as how a team performs in the minutes their best player isn't on the floor?"
RIP Nassir Little Minutes 2021-2021
ya imagine Nassir Little or Skal Labisseiere being drafted in the top 3.
I'd rather depend on RHJ than Nassir Little in the playoffs.
"Probably no one if Nassir Little is healthy.  We literally had to sign someone though because we had two roster spots open...as far as signing someone to fill a bench seat, he's a good get."
"Why you probably shouldn't necessarily worry about the #1 HS Junior and waste time studying their games:   Zion was the #5 recruit in his class.  Bol Bol was 4. Romeo Langford was 6.  Nassir Little was 2.   Trevon Duval was ranked ahead of Collin Sexton and Trae Young.  Josh Jackson and Harry Giles? 1-2 over Tatum.   Skal Labissierre was ahead of Ben Simmons, Jaylen Brown, and Brandon Ingram.  Karl Towns was 5th. Cliff Alexander was 4th, ahead of him. So were Mudiay, Jah, and Stanley Johnson.  Austin Rivers was ahead of Anthony Davis and Bradley Beal   Josh Selby was #1 in his class. Kyrie was 4th."
"Yes they would. We know, because Dame had a worse team this season for 31 games and we did way better.  The Blazers went 18-13 with Gary Trent Junior as our 2nd best player because Nurkic and CJ were both out. Dude is 22 year old. We gave big minutes to Anfernee Simons (21) and Nassir Little (20). Steph isn't the only one with bad and young teammates  Wiggins is literally scoring more a game *and* scoring more efficiently than Trent.  Think Oubre's 52% TS% is bad? Try Rodney Hood's **league worst 43.6%**  Harden and Dame are flat out better at carrying a team than Curry is (and Harden is just a better player at this point). Dame would kill to have someone like Draymond on this team to beat traps and an actual defense around him instead of **the 29th ranked defense in the NBA** because Enes Kanter was our rim protector and only big on the roster."
Nassir Little
"Nassir little would most likely play over Simons, but he's out tonight."
"we need a new coaching staff. our offensive playbook is still ""hope dame drops 40, and hopefully someone else gets hot using ISO"". we still have no answer to the double team besides ""shoot from farther Dame"".     Defensively, this roster is capable of much better, but whatever defensive coaching abilities we had, we lost when vanderpool left the coaching staff.     We're a very 1 note team, we put up a good fight in the first half, and can usually go into the halftime ahead, sometimes even by double digits depending on how hot we got, but then in the 3rd quarter we get absolutely wrecked, the opponent makes adjustments, and stotts just draws penises on the board. and then we just hope that Dame can sink enough 35+ footers to keep us afloat/win it at the end.     we occasionally have glimpses of offensive creativity, we'll see a play or 2 were we \*gasp\* pass the ball aroudn a lot, and it results in an open 3 from Melo or Gary, or a cut to the basket from DJJ and we go ""omg that was great, we should do that more"", but then we dont.     To add to all of that, Stotts isn't just constipated on playdesign, he's also stubborn as fuck on who he plays, Nassir Little will come in, he 3 of 4, and have 3 good defensive possessions and stotts will bench him to put in Hood, and then we proceed to watch Hood struggle badly for 20+ minutes. and Little will never again see the court unless we're down by 20+.     Its insane and mind boggling how he refuses to use the young players with energy to give the old vets rest, and then we get shocked when the guys who play a ton go down."
"Maybe flying under the radar, but Nassir Little recently cracked the rotation of the Blazers after playing very little last year. He's had a couple huge games for us and has grown in basically every aspect of the game, including shooting, finishing, defense and even shown some good court vision."
"Nope, RJ was the unanimous #1 recruit coming out of high school. Most places had Zion in the 3-5 range behind Nassir Little and Cam Reddish. It was kinda BS because Zion stayed local and didn’t really play much in some of the big tournaments for high school players like RJ did, which is why he got rated lower   Most people could tell Zion would be better but technically RJ was the higher rated recruit"
"He didn't have a job for exactly the reason you see in this video. Melo didn't make the swing pass to Nassir Little. who was wide open in the corner. Melo is shooting 39% this year Little is shooting 43%, he is so selfish he didn't pass to the guy who was open so he could fling a low percentage contested shot. This is why he will never win a chip. Melo is not a team player."
Nassir Little may end up being the best of the Zach Collins/Anfernee Simons/Gary Trent Jr draft pick group.
"Seems kinda familiar. We sat one of our players who was on fire, Nassir Little, for the near entire 4th and let Rodney Hood run the offense until like 3 minutes left when we were already down 6."
"I’ve always wanted Nassir Little to do well. I go to UNC and he wasn’t really great for us, but my friend had a class with him during the second semester and they had a group project towards the end of the semester. Nassir Little ended up being in her group, but he texted them all one day saying something like “By the way, I’m not going to do this project because I’m going to drop out and declare for the draft.” Pretty cool guy if you ask me."
"Skill Boost: Nassir Little. He would be a really solid starter with a tighter jump shot and handle. I think he'll get there.  Height: CJ, just so y'all would stop the trade rumors and shut the fuck up  Athleticism: Nurkic, would turn into a potential lib threat and more explosive transition player"
1. nassir little 2. jokic 3. embiid 4. giannis 5. kd 6. harden 7. lebron 8. kawhi 9. dame 10. steph
Yup this is my whole thing. If people want a coaching change then fine but if we run it back with this same roster we’re going to run into the exact same issues unless Nassir Little or/and Anfernee Simons take unrealistically huge leaps
"I think the early findings for the newest mRNA vaccines suggest vaccinated people are very unlikely to transmit the disease if exposed.   Even if that were not the case and the vaccine only protects you,  you'd think LeBron would have looked around the league at what covid did to his peers to see the very real consequences of catching the disease. Let's not talk about wanting to protect others, just selfishly consider what it could do to him. Young uber athletic Jayson Tatum was huffing and puffing his way on the court for a good half season before finally getting into full game shape just now. His new teammate Evan Fournier talked about being in a brain fog from the disease. Young Blazer Nassir Little lost like 25 pounds and felt like he was going to die for weeks during the summer and missed the beginning of the season from his own bout.  The severe effects of covid are very much real and even now with one of the best vaccination drives in the world we are still seeing 50k cases a day. Tatum probably has some mild scarring in his lungs given how long it took him to recover. Compared with the theoretical at best risks from the vaccine? Should be a no brainer.   Any reason James has against the vaccine is purely irrational. It's a free country though and he can decline the vaccine. I look forward to the pikachu face avalanche on social media if he gets knocked out for 2 weeks right as the Lakers are scraping for that last playoff spot though!"
Zion exploded at Duke. Mocks before the season had him 3rd behind RJ and Nassir Little. Nothing to do with AAU and pre college hype.
"Not true. Derrick Jones Jr was one of the best finishers in the NBA last season in Miami but in Portland the Stottsfense turned him into a spot up 3 point shooter (same thing happened with Mo Harkless earlier). Nassir Little is also an excellent finisher at the rim.   And to your point, Ant doesn’t need to finish through contact. Portland has outside threat which pulls defenses towards the perimeter. Since all eyes are on CJ and Dame, you can set plays initiating backdoor cuts with Simons on the baseline. Pick and pop with Nurk and Dame/CJ will pull the big further up. Have Nurk flip a pass to the cutter and viola, but Portland rarely runs that play at all."

How much help does Nassir Little need
I've already told you dude. Read the comments and ingest the information instead of just waiting for your chance to word vomit inaccurate negativity.  Kanter's minutes would've been replaced by Zach Collins. This is neither a Terry or Neil (roster construction) problem since he re-broke his ankle during preseason training camp. It was on Terry to play Kanter over Rondae Hollis Jefferson and Harry Giles at the 5.   Melo's minutes could've been replaced by Derrick Jones Jr and/or Nassir Little. DJJ was our max MLE free agent signing and Nassir Little was a promising 2nd year 1st round pick.  Dame sits for a whole 8-10 minutes a game. During that period we played Anfernee Simons at guard who's a deadly scorer (way more efficient than Carmelo fucking Anthony).  You're just speaking straight nonsense right now. Go away.
Nassir Little
"""Additional assets"" being deadweight like Nassir Little and Zac Collins who immediately would be the worst players on the Pistons roster.  And Collins is a RFA who will be overpaid for his performance.  How do you balance the money with Grant's contract?  Yeah, I'd love to get 2 first round picks (misread your original) but nobody is giving up that much for CJ or Grant."
"Yeah idk.  I think most packages with CJ would include someone like Nassir LIttle(young talented guy), but that wouldn't really help you cause you need to be good now."
Nassir Little until he shows how good he is in the NBA
"&gt; Although I’m not convinced that snagging CJ for long term (albeit less money) is any better, financially.  Yeah I would agree - it isn't any better for them.  &gt; The reason I think the trade could work is that we can attach picks and promising young players to it. The Heat also fizzled out early, so they may want a change.  Jimmy is the perfect Miami Heat player. I don't see a world where MIA values some late 1sts (which POR 1sts will be late with Dame, Jimmy, Norm &amp; Nurkic) and Anfernee Simons (who will be a RFA next summer) or Nassir Little.   I think MIA is fine rolling the dice with their current core and internal growth of homegrown players + future free agency. I mean they signed Butler to a max contract when they had negative cap space lol"
"Are people actually serious about a Middleton/CJ swap? I can barely see a CJ/Tobias Harris swap happening. If either team does that they'll have a gaping hole at forward.   I think the best thing to do with CJ is trade him to somebody for a couple of firsts and then overpay for Jerami Grant (2 FRPs, a young asset in either Zac Collins or Nassir Little and potentially draft compensation on top of that). The market is slim and it'd be a heavy price to pay but if you have to give Detroit a Godfather offer so you can finally have a proper two-way wing you go ahead and do it."
"this team had a coach who made kanter and melo (2 players that were either out of the league or were given away for free) major rotation players. 20+ minutes a night for each of em. That more than anything sank this team since they're so awful on defense and they had a coach who was committed to playing them, which created an accountability problem (if you were to watch nurk's post game session, this was obvious).  Keeping a core of Nurk/RoCo/Norman/Dame (and hopefully trading CJ + FRP's for a SF of some sort) is really nice. Zach Collins/Nassir Little/Derrick Jones Jr/Anfernee Simons are much better options to come off the bench than guys like Melo/Kanter, who just brick your entire team.  The org just needs to get this coaching hire correct, re-sign Norm and find a decent trade package for CJ (doesn't need to be a star, just need a better fit - like a Harrison Barnes type). And obviously move on from Kanter and Melo (who are FA's).   I just don't understand why it's so hard to picture fixing Portland."
"Immanuel Quickley, Lu Dort, Cam Johnson, Nassir Little are my picks to have the best chance to just explode into relevance"
"Nassir Little is not an asset at all man. Simons is a good 3pt shooter but hasn't really shown fuck all else. Way too skinny to drive inside and has no playmaking abilities or defensive talent. CJ is set to make an insane amount of money for the next few years, and is probably the worst defender out of the people you listed. Why would anybody take back those players. Who could you even get with those players ?"
"i feel like the spurs would really like zach collins and nassir little, so if we were going to make a trade for someone like derozan it would be cj got the salary but it would be filled out with good value for a rebuild."
"All traded except for Zach Collins, Anfernee Simons, and Nassir Little"
"Blazers have to give up Nassir Little too and probably add picks, people said Kuzma was better than Jayson Tatum so he's probably gonna be elite any day now"
Nassir Little is untouchable.
"jimmy butler or ben simmons would be ideal. i'd offer up CJ/Nassir Little/Ant/FRP's to make it happen (not all of those, but some combo of them)."
CJ/Nassir Little and a FRP for Jimmy. Make it happen.
"CJ + Picks + assets (Nassir Little maybe) for Jimmy Butler, Heat might think the Butler + Bam combo hit its ceiling last year and want to retool around Adebayo for the future"
Blazers fans - what ever happened to Nassir Little? Just never got in the rotation or?
"Cole Anthony, Harrison Barnes, Tony Bradley, Reggie Bullock, Ed Davis, Wayne Ellington, Danny Green, Justin Jackson, Cam Johnson, Coby White, Nassir Little, Theo Pinson"
"Cam Johnson, Nassir Little, Coby White"
"Portland owns all of their draft picks (after this upcoming draft), and still have Anfernee Simons and Nassir Little on rookie contracts as asset sweeteners. Gary Trent Jr trick y'all, dudes about to be overpaid relative to the value he provides on the court after this summer. The RFA is a curse, not a blessing."
"If we played Nassir Little and DJJ I think we'd still have the better bench, but Stotts doesn't like athletic forwards I guess"
I’ve had some commentators call Nassir Little “Little General”.  Wasn’t there another player with that nickname?
"Can we see some Nassir Little, please?"
"His lack of adjustments usually are the thing we have a problem with.  Many times, he sticks with the ""usual"" and doesn't try new things when that's clearly not working or a bad fit.  For instance, playing Enes Kanter minutes when Jokic is on the floor, or keeping Jones Jr, RHJ and Nassir Little glued to the bench when they'd do better at defending Denver's squad than undersized Norman Powell or CJ.   Especially if we're just going to be hero ball on offense where one player basically isos all game, whether it's dame, cj, melo, whoever - it won't matter whether some of these dudes can space the floor or not, if we won't pass to them anyway."
"Simons tries and it's getting better. There's only so much you can expect out of a young project guard.  The rest is on Stotts refusing to teach defense and play better defenders. We've got Nassir Little, DJJ and RHJ rotting on the bench. None of them are going to look great camping out on the 3pt line like Stotts wants in this offense, but then even Powell is having issues with that. All 3 are great athletes who could at least help situationally and should be getting a lot of Melo's minutes.   Plus we made a bad call on Moses Brown, who has looked interesting for the Thunder and would give us another option instead of Kanter."
"well the good news is that there are more games, so we'll see. I would be careful glorifying winning a game against Denver tho. So what? They're missing Murray so it's not really a fair fight anyway, regardless of whether Jokic is the MVP. I'd say the terrible defense is attributed to the worst front-court 2nd unit in the NBA (all time?) on defense. Melo and Kanter are unwatchable, close to being unplayable and unfortunately, Portland has no one else to play. Dinosaur Paul Millsap shouldn't be lighting up your team and determining the game. I'd at least try Nassir Little in those minutes"
"Nassir Little, all-pro"
Nassir Little was ready to throw hands 🤯
Literally one player (Nassir Little) reacted to that guy. Melo looks like he's talking to other fans so can't tell what's going on there.
Nassir Little is jawing at the fan and Collins looks right at him before he looks down.
"You could say the exact same for the Blazers last year.   Nurk out until the bubble, Hood and Collins out the whole season basically. And all three were starters.   Had whiteside as our starting center and this season he was the backup for the Kings and only played 36 games.   Meaningful rotation minutes to Hezonja, Tolliver, Labisierre, Swanigan and all three are out of the league.   Hoard and Gabriel started games and the two of them played a combined 40 games this season.   We had 20 games of Trevor Ariza. Half of a season of Bazemore who’s on the warriors now and half a season of Melo who was out of the league for a year.   GTJ didn’t break out until the bubble. Nassir Little was a rookie and extremely raw. And Anfernee Simons was statistically a bottom 5 player in the league.   We don’t have Dame we would’ve struggled to break 10 wins. CJ is better than anyone Steph has offensively but you could argue Dray, Wiggins, Oubre are all better than anyone we had defensively last season. Not to mention covid fucked our schedule. When the season got postponed we had around 20 games left and the easiest sos. But in the bubble we ended up having the second hardest."
"Let me just go down the roster. There's a lot of unknowns.   Dame - definitely staying  CJ - if we make it out of the first round, I'd say he's definitely staying. If we lose in the first round, who knows. Total wildcard  Norm - another total wildcard. Will he want to stay somewhere he's the 3rd best guard? If he does, how much are we willing to pay a 3rd 6'3 guard who we'll have to play at SF? Repeater tax is an issue as well  RoCo - definitely staying  Nurk - definitely staying  Melo - likely upto him if he wants to play another season. I don't see us not signing him if he wants to come back  DJJ - has a PO for 10mil so he could leave for a bigger role, but idk how much money he'll find. I think he stays  Anfernee Simons - definitely staying (unless we put him in a package for a big trade)  Enes Kanter - likely gonna re-sign him, but definitely possible that we let him walk  RHJ - unless he gets a better offer from somewhere else, I think we'd keep him on a min  Nassir Little - definitely staying (unless we put him in a package for a big trade)  Harry Giles - probably going somewhere else where he'll either get more than a minimum or will get more mins  Zach Collins - another wildcard. How do you come to a fair contract value with someone who essentially hasn't played in 2 years. Gun to my head, we re-sign him even if it's just the QO  CJ Elleby - staying"
"Hope other teams rack with injuries, and other teams are desperate to trade with Portland. That CJ contract is bad contract, and Blazers don't have trade assets. Unless there team out there who want Nassir Little, Anfernee Simons, and injured Zach Collins."
"Zach Collins, Covington, Melo, TJ Leaf, Nassir Little, and Rondae-Hollis Jefferson aren’t enough.  They need Porzingis."
Nah CJ along with everyone else not named Nassir Little and Anfernee Simons are gone
"huh lol.  Like I don't think we're going to be able to contend but this is just wrong.  We have every single pick besides this years late first.  Anfernee Simons is 22, Nassir Little is 21, and whatever people's thoughts on CJ he's definitely still an asset."
"Blazers prolly want to keep Anfernee so McCollum, Nassir Little, two firsts for Simmons"
Nassir Little
Collin Sexton and Nassir Little
"You’re not going to get Cov, but I can offer you one lightly used Nassir Little"
"&gt;	Zach Collins as the lottery pick  &gt;	Trading away Gary Trent Jr  &gt;	Traded 2021 pick to Houston   &gt;	Only young people on the team are Anfernee Simons (good), Nassir Little (eh) and CJ Elleby (no)  If the Blazers don’t win it then we’re not going to have a good time"
Lol if you think anfernee simons and nassir little are significantly higher ceiling players than the guys I mentioned there’s a massive disconnect here
Nassir Little.  Dude is big &amp; strong and his 3-point stroke looks good (he jumped up to 35% this year).  Not a ton of juice off the bounce or playmaking skills but he could be a 3&amp;D guy.  Also he's still only 21.
nassir little
Lol... kanter + nurkic + nassir little for ad? Good trade?
I feel like Portland might be the riskiest of all. The next guy out is going to be Olshey and he's got one more hail mary roster shakeup. We know new GMs keep inherited coaches on a short leash. There's a good chance whoever the new coach is will be watching Nassir Little and Simons put up a combined 60 on 36% field goal percentage and getting pity phone calls from Stephen Silas afterward.
"Would be sad to see Melo go but he did give us 2 good seasons. I’d be excited to see what Nassir Little can do with his minutes, also our roster is in desperate need of defense so playing an athletic wing might be in our best interest."
"Will Barton 2nd round in 2012  2013 CJ pick #10  Then traded with the cavs for the rights to  Allen Crabbe with low value picks  2014 no draft picks from the Gerald Wallace trade  2015 drafted Rondae Hollis Jefferson with #23 traded to get Mason Plumlee. Drafted Pat Connoughton in the 2nd round  2016 traded for 47th pick Jake Layman  2017 Zach Collins with a trade up to #10, Caleb Swanigan in the 2nd round  2018 Anfernee Simons with #24 and Gary Trent in the late 2nd round  2019 Nassir Little with a late pick  2020 CJ Elleby in the 2nd round.    All these guys got significant playing time for the blazers. Only Caleb Swanigan and Allen Crabbe is not in the league right now.   Crabbe got a huge payday before fizzling out. Barton is a significant role player in Denver. Pat is playing big minutes with Milwaukee. Gary Trent is about to get a fat ass pay check and Simons shot for over 40% on 3 point shooting.   Most of these guys are low value projects turned into solid role players and low end starters. Pretty good draft resume for not having a top 8 pick since Damian Lillard"
"Can't tell if youre being sarcastic or not, because people do think he sucks at drafting somehow.  Dame and CJ were amazing picks.  Plus, basically every second round pick he's ever made has become a rotation player, if not a starter. His first round picks are hit and miss, but for the most part, he's hit, especially considering we pick in the 20s every time. Anfernee Simons, Nassir Little, are great picks at 24 and 25. Zach Collins was a good pick, if he could ever be healthy. Yeah there were much better players picked after him, so it's not a *great* pick, but for the average 10th pick, it was solid. Swanigan was a bust though"
I’d prefer to keep him around because my ideal starting five would be Dame-Norm-Simmons-Cov-Nurk with Seth getting significant time off the bench.   Maybe Nassir little or Anfernee Simons? (or both for that matter).
"There was absolutely no reason he ""had"" to play those guys heavy minutes. We had Nassir Little and DJJ (and RHJ later) on the bench, both of which are very serviceable defensive players.   Furthermore, I actually believe Stotts contributed to why Lillard, CJ, and Simons are not good at defense. Every single guard ever developed by Stotts has been bad at defense. Lillard, Crabbe, CJ, Elliott Williams, Simons, Gary, Connuaghton (while he was here), etc. The only good at defense guard I can think of is Armon Johnson and he played like half a season and was known as a defensive specialist coming into the league.   Stotts just doesn't know how to teach defense, especially on the perimeter. Furthermore his scheme is literally to let the dribbler past you and funnel them into the big to try and force a midrange jumper. What ends up happening is they kick it out to the perimeter and we can't rotate properly and they end up with a corner 3. This is why we gave up the most open 3s in the NBA this season, an absolute disaster in today's NBA.   I have zero doubt whoever our coach is next year will improve the defense"
"Look at everyone picked around him tho. Darius Bazley, Nassir Little, Luka Samanic, Goga bitadze, Dylan Windler.  They all sound like fake names lol."
"If someone can name another player that can play PG that teams would be willing to give up for Simmons, I'm all ears. I just don't think that player exists.   It would be CJ + assets for Simmons too I'd imagine. Adding a guy like DJJ to Philly would make sense, or Nassir Little."
"The bench and coaching were the issues defensively. After Powell got added to the starting lineup we had one of the best net rating of any starting five in the league. Playing Kanter and Melo together was a recipe for disaster. Them not being staggered in the rotation is what I think ultimately got Stotts fired. Stotts also benched Nassir Little, who was one of our best perimeter defenders. I think you will see a lot more differences from the team next year other than just hard work."
and Nassir Little. Blazers got more athletic the last few years
"Shit, I forgot Nassir Little as well. Hell, even Dame was in the dunk contest once upon a time, lol."
Nassir Little  Edit: obviously GTJ too but I thought that was too close to an easy pick
Nassir Little
Nassir Little
I’ll raise you one Nassir Little. His 30pt game (albeit in a blowout loss) last year convinced me that if he develops his shot and gets a little more confident off the bounce he could really make waves. Simons has yet to show any potential finishing at the rim despite the incredible hops. Watched him dunk in a game maybe twice last year.
"Nassir Little, a guy surrounded by great offensive talent who was a steal for his draft class.  With Melo off the Blazers, he should be able to get some time to put on a talent show."
He comp'd Cam Reddish and Nassir Little to Randy Moss and Rob Gronkowski Ive never seen anything like it lol
I don't know how hot these are but Blazers top 5 seed and Nassir Little breakout season/possible 6moy
Depends on your definition of unexpected. Does Nassir Little count?
Oshae Brissett Ish Wainwright Max Struss Jordan Nwora Nassir Little
"Nassir Little. Drafted later than he was, had some early injuries and covid. But when he played he was solid on offense and great on-ball defense."
"Neil Olshey is a top 10 GM in the league  Gary Trent Jr will be an all-star (this isn't super unpopular anymore now that he went to Toronto, but I've been saying it since last season)  Nassir Little also has all-star potential and will be a 6moy candidate this year  Presti had an awful offseason and he could've built a potential playoff team if he played his cards right (without trading any of his picks), and he's gonna waste SGA's career  Raptors are gonna be a top 6 seed"
"CJ and Siakam's salaries are only 2.1m apart, they don't need DJJ for salary.  It would either be one of our young guys (Nassir Little more likely than Simons), or no salary filler.  Additionally, they have no need for CJ, so they likely require multiple more picks (like 2 picks 2 swaps, or 3FRP).  That is, unless a 3-team trade is found to take CJ for other stuff.  Blazers might view 3 picks as an overpay; Raptors likely won't consider less (if CJ McCollum is the contract they're trading for him)."
Simons and Nassir Little both have nice ceilings still.
"Cam Reddish, Nassir Little, Romeo Langford are a couple from the last few years."
"Top* - Nassir Little was in Zion and RJ Barrett conversations when he committed to UNC. He was solid in his 1 year, but not up to that level"
I’m calling my shot! Nassir Little
Nassir little remember his name
"Homer take, but I still think CJ McCollum, Nassir Little, and a first seems like a fair swap for Simmons (even though he's rumored to not want to play in Portland). CJ and Simmons would each be a much better fit on the opposite team. I don't think it'll happen, or if it does, it'll be closer to the trade deadline. I'm sure Morey knows that CJ would be a great fit with Embiid and Harris, but he's holding out hope that Dame will want out eventually. It's like he and Neil Olshey are playing a game of chicken. Which GM will get more desperate and blink first?"

Nassir Little
"I’m biased as a Blazer fan, but I think Nassir Little has all the tools to break out this year. He dealt with Covid and a coach who doesn’t like playing younger talent last year, so I think under Billups he could develop into a starting caliber player."
"Genuine question, if it were cj + nassir little/anfernee simons and whatever picks we have, could that get a deal done on siakam?"
Well our power forward depth chart was shallower than a kiddie pool and Terry didn't like playing inexperienced players like Nassir Little over him
"Greg Brown, Derrick Jones Jr and Nassir Little might be the most entertaining dunking trio in the NBA."
"This just makes too much sense, it almost feels like it would be silly if it didn't happen. CJ + a first, or CJ + Nassir Little seem like solid swaps to me. Maybe throw in a second-round pick with Nassir if Morey balks."
"Out of respect to Nassir Little, I wouldn’t call him that"
"Very interested in Bagley, Cole Anthony and Nassir Little"
"Immanuel Quickley 6MOTY  Cam Johnson, Jonathan Isaac, Nassir Little, Cole Anthony take huge jumps"
Immanuel Quickley   Cam Johnson  Nassir Little  1 Jonathan Isaac will be a DPOY candidate if he can stay healthy finally.  Shai is gonna be thought of as a top 15 player next year
"I feel like teams are getting WAY smarter. The top-20 is usually now littered with guys who you are pretty sure are going to have an impact (aside from stupid talented 18 year old freaks like Mo Bamba).  Examples of this - Huerter's jump in 2018 (long and elite shooter), Cam Johnson, Desmond Bane jumping to the 1st round, Herro's jump, Clarke's jump, etc. I feel like teams are really emphasizing skill and NBA-readiness more than ever before.  Guys like Bol Bol, Nassir Little, Darius Bazley, Kevin Knox, KPorter (he panned out), Hamidou Diallo, etc. all saw big drops in their draft stock from where they were projected by general media  I think we see some guys like Corey Kispert, Kessler Edwards, Joe Wieskamp, Trey Murphy, etc. go before super ""talented"" guys like Keon and Kai Jones. I see Kuminga taking a big slide as well."
We don’t have an actual small forward  Our defence is still going to be below average  Our 2nd most important player is an inconsistent malcontent who gets in his own head too much  Our bench is relying a lot on Anfernee Simons and Nassir Little taking leaps
And hopefully Nassir Little
"Cam Johnson  Immanuel Quickley  Nassir Little  Shai isn't a sleeper but I think he'll end this year as a top 20 player, which is a ""sleeper"" pick"
Nassir Little + Dame’s shooting and handles
CJ McCollum and Nassir Little for Ben Simmons
We trade CJ and Covington and we’re about back to where we started with 1 wing lol. It doesn’t make sense for us. CJ and picks? Sure. CJ and nassir little or something? Sure
"Damn you managed to list ZERO people that were used to acquire Lebron, good work!   Not to mention shockingly you managed to ignore Gary Trent Jr, who is arguably the best prospect of all of those players and was drafted in the second round.  And lastly, if you think Nassir Little or Anfernee Simons suck and or busts, it just goes to demonstrate your ignorance even further."
Nassir Little
"Dallas, Denver, Jazz, Warriors  The only teams I don't see Portland having a chance against are the Lakers, Clippers (iffy with Kawhi) and the Suns.  Everyone has such a short term memory these days and only remember the Denver series which was lost due to having Melo/Kanter as their primary bench players and Stotts not giving a flying fuck about defense. CJ/Nurk missed half the season and Powell was added at the trade deadline.  Stotts has been replaced with Billups and Melo/Kanter simply being gone will improve team defense. They've also been replaced by much better defenders in Nance Jr. and Zeller. Now add in a full season of Powell and the improvement of Nassir Little and it's a good roster.  Dame/CJ/Powell/Covington/Nurkic with a bench of Simons/Snell/Little/Nance Jr./Zeller   That roster can easily compete for a top-4 seeding in the West with some luck in the health department."
"I'm not sure we'd go for it with RoCo as part of the deal. He is incredibly valuable to our starting lineup defensively, and we need as much defense as possible.  How about Nassir Little instead? He's going to be similar to Tobias Harris with a little play time under his belt,  and far cheaper."
"&gt; CJ McCollum, Robert Covington, Nassir Little  Bruh. Wat. No. We would never do this. If anything, CJ straight up, but even then, we shouldn't. Young Socialite doesn't want to play here. He isn't worth the bad chemistry."
"CJ McCollum, Robert Covington, Nassir Little  Derrick White, Thaddeus Young, Lonnie Walker, 2024 unprotected 1st, 2025 swap, 2025 bulls 1st  Malik Beasley, Patrick Beverly, Okogie, 2022 pick swap, 2023 Unprotected 1st, 2025 unprotected 1st  Tyrese Halliburton, Buddy Hield, Marvin Bagley, 2022 pick swap, 2023 1st, 2025 1st  I’m still acting as if he’s a positive asset. I think most of these deals are fair-ish and realistic"
"The Blazers were first in both isolation and pick and roll, because Lillard is incredible at those two play types- the defense with all the starters in ninth in the league too, the offense was elite as one of the best in the league and the starters were fantastic, but the team cratered with bench units.    Sending out Kanter and Melo, and bringing in Larry Nance jr, Tony Snell, Cody Zeller, all will help with that bench defense.  We’re hoping Afernee Simons and Nassir Little can grow and step up there as well, which would be huge to see growth there as Simons turned into a quality shooter and Little impressed in limited minutes."
"They're no Carmelo, Anfernee Simons, Nassir Little though   #1 in the league baby"
Nassir Little
"We traded a player who got benched for the second half of the season.  Most of our subreddit were struggling to see if a coaching change meant he could be utilized again.  A lot of us still saw no role for him.  We traded him for Nance, who we will happily utilize for around 30 minutes a game.  He's a multi-role player, allowing flexibility in line-ups and looks.  It opens up a role for Nassir Little, too."
That would be the plan.  Although their true small ball lineup would remove Nurkic and replace him with a wing like Nance or Nassir Little.  Dame CJ Powell RoCo Nance might be interesting since Nance would probably work better as a small ball 5 than RoCo. If Nance really gels well this could be their closing lineup in a lot of situations.
"Unless Philly sells low and agrees to a CJ Simmons swap, I think the Blazers run back their end of the season Dame/CJ/Norm/RoCo/Nurkic starting lineup, where CJ will typically get subbed out early and replaced by a wing like Nance or Nassir Little and then CJ comes back to lead the 2nd unit and to close games.  Sample size was small at the end of the season, but when Nurkic returned, that small ball starting lineup supposedly high the highest plus minus of any lineup in the league. So if they run it back Portland would be counting on Norman Powell now fully gels with the lineup and his increased offense is made up by a now fully healthy Nurkic, and replacing no defense bench players like Melo and Kanter with better defensive role players like Nance and Zeller.  It's a big if, but if Billups really can institute good team defense strategies to try to cover for Dame/CJ/Norm in the same lineup, it might work. The amount of shooting at all three levels, spacing, and distributors on that small ball lineup is quite impressive."
Nassir Little will win MIP in the next 3 years
Nassir Little. Love him.
has Nassir Little gotten better at all? I liked him out of college but idk what happened.
"Teams tend to behave differently when they don't own their pick.  Jae Crowder going immediately into the starting lineup for instance or us taking the much more polished Clarke over riskier projects like Bazley, Nassir Little, Keldon Johnson, or Kevin Porter."
"While you can think he’s overrated, but I’d have disagree When it comes playoff time and big moments, dame can defend, he played great D last playoffs, and great D against Westbrook in 2019. And has taken several game saving changes over the last couple of years from good help side D. He dived on the ball on a clutch steal in the nets game in the bubble. So he does make big defensive plays.   Dame is also a pretty good playmaker. He is one of the deadliest pick and roll players in the league, largely cuz of his passing to the roller through the pockets. He averages more assists then Steph and Kyrie, in a system that has much less ball movement, spacing and generally lower assists.   I’m sorry, but the players that come through Portland have the best years of their careers for the most part. His leadership allows for a lot of players to play their basketball. There is very little examples when a player comes into Portland and doesn’t play their basketball of their career. We revived Melos career, players like aminu, harkless, Plumlee, Nurkic, batum, Matthews, layman had their best years here. Cj blossomed into an all star next to dame. A second round pick of Trent jr blossomed under dames leadership. Even late round guys like nassir and anfernee Simons, look like promising young talents and I largely think of dames Portland culture"
"Nassir Little maybe. It's 12 players/roster only, so not too bad."
"Plus the 2 young guys Anfernee Simons and Nassir Little look like legit rotational pieces this year. Simons especially looks like he picked up an extra gear or 3 compared to last year, when he was mostly a catch and shoot 3 point shooter. Pair that elite 3 point shooting with some of the cuts he made into the lane tonight ... hoo boy."
Guess the sixers will just have to settle for nassir little
Yeah they’re hot. Can’t really gameplan for Nassir Little dropping late shot clock bombs. That’s a defensive possession you’ll take 10/10 times.
Teams just need to wait out the sixers until they are absolutely desperate to get rid of him to not have to eat his contract. I bet the Blazers can eventually get him for nassir little and a couple draft picks lol
anfernee simons and (more controversially) nassir little
Nassir Little
Nassir Little is another one that had a really bad reaction.
"Yea was thinking those guys had a chance to develop on non-playoff teams, a guy like Nassir Little drafted ahead of them hasn't gotten too many mins to play and learn."
"Lol I don’t know why I thought that. Okay, so not as great as I originally thought, but still I think solid additions.  Let me also add I think we can finally see what Nassir Little can bring, he’s been very unlucky thus far in his career."
"- ATL: Hunter will win MIP. - BKN: Nash will find a way not to play Claxton again. - BOS: Nesmith will turn out to be a player in the mold of Covington much sooner than expected. - CHA: Plumlee will have a double double season with 4 APG. - CHI: Patrick Williams will struggle in his soph year. However, those counting him out long term will be wrong, as he'll develop in a major force after this season. - DAL: Tyler Terry will break out and play a decent role. - DEN: Zeke Nnaji will start pushing Gordon by shooting lights out. - DET: Jerami Grant will be traded before the AS game. - GSW: Poole will have at least 5 games in which he shoots 20 FG and hit under 6 of those. - HOU: Jalen Green will win ROY. - IND: Chris Duarte runner up for ROY. He'll post averages somewhere in the line of rookie Mitchell/Wade. - LAC: Will be very very disappointing. - LAK: Wayne Ellington is top 5 in 3pm this season. - MEM: Melton will, once again, play very limited minutes. - MIA: Haslem will play only a handfull of minutes but will be ejected from one game for a fight. - MIL: Grayson Allen will fill in nicely for DDV and might not give up tge starting position when DDV returns. - MIN: KAT will have a season which has him in the convo for MVP but ultimately not win due to team record. - PHI: Jaden Springer will surprise. He will become what people hoped Zhaire Smith would be, before he nearly died. - PHO: Mikal Bridges does not take that next step. - POR: Nassir Little top 5 MIP. Larry Nance 6MOY. - SAC: Haliburton and Davion Mitchell will make at least 5 starting backcourts cry this season. - SAS: Devin Vassell still will be disappointing.  - TOR: Khem Birch will average a double double. - UTA: Bojan will be traded before the AS game. - WAS: Gafford will post a pts/blk/reb triple double."
Didn’t Mo Bamba have a really bad case last year? I thought I heard of Nassir Little in Portland too having a tough time with it. Same with Marco Rossi in the NHL but obv he’s less known
"You’re missing the point here, ben is an all star player (in the East I know). If we want to tank for the lottery then why roll him out at all? We’d clear the roster of big contracts and roll out dudes like Simons and Nassir little. Ben is still too good of a player to be a tank commander."
Nassir Little got 30 last year after a previous high of 12
Nassir Little got smoked by it too. Not much fun. Lucky.
"From the left field, nassir little. I really think he has what it takes to become a real superstar. Good head on shoulders, elite physicals and just need to get more opportunities. I can see him becoming a very big deal in the future."
"Real possibility here, Nassir Little has already ate a chunk out of his minutes"
"Larry with the insane stat line of 16/9/3/3/1 last night. He was absolutely everywhere on both offense and defense in the second half. Him and Nassir Little have been huge energy spark plugs this season and both of those dudes got us up off the mat last night with their hustle.   S/O to Nas too with his great defense on Demar down the stretch, dude has the potential to be an absolute dog on that end.  Feels so good to have Dame time back with those deep 3s down the stretch.  And lastly, gotta give Kudos to Billups for making seemingly all the right subs in the second half to get us back into this.  I know we’re still struggling on the road but this seemed like a growing/turning the point game for the team as a whole. We’ll see though."
"IMO the 2015 high school senior class shows why letting anyone come straight out of high school to the NBA would be disastrous.  --------------------------  Skal Labissiere would have gone #1 or #2 depending on the team. He had just as much hype as Ben Simmons and some places even ranking him higher.   Big men such as Cheick Diallo, Diamond Stone, Ivan Rabb, and Stephen Zimmerman all would have gone top 10 most likely. The hype around all of them was absolutely insane.   You'd have dudes that barely could even make a summer league roster being drafted in the lottery every single year, only for them to be exposed in summer league and in practice as clearly not even as an end of the bench promising potential player.    A bottom feeder team could have potentially spent 5 years with a top 2 pick and came away with Skal Labissiere, Emmanuel Mudiay, Harry Giles, Marvin Bagley, and Nassir Little. All guys ranked in the top of their high school classes and at the time, mocked to be top picks in their drafts based on what they'd shown in AAU and workouts."
Nassir Little and Larry Nance to close it out. Love to see it
He is what i hope nassir little will be.. insane

Nassir little??? Now that’s a name I haven’t heard in many a year
Nassir little is an insane athlete
"Ok maybe I'm completely wrong about the bulls. Their team construction is really weird, they don't have a superstar and their defense is quite iffy. But they have a solid accumulation of talent and they've looked really good so far. I honestly have no idea what to think of them.  The trailblazers are 4-5 with dame actively hurting the team with his play. With the rise of nassir little and the acquisition of nance, they actually have a solid group of forwards. A CJ for simmons swap might honestly be what it takes to actually launch them into contender status, but they actually have a solid roster."
How about Cody Zeller's 0 points and team low -9. Benched because he's a worse Center option than Nassir Little?  Care to comment?
Team low -9 in only 11 minutes. Nearly cost the team the game because he's so shit. Had to be benched because he's actually a worse Center than fucking Nassir Little.
Play Nassir Little
"I think if you gave Stotts this roster, the team would have looked a lot better last year.  I don't think Nassir Little could have been this good last year getting over COVID and all."
Enes Kanter -&gt; Cody Zeller  Carmelo Anthony -&gt; Larry Nance Jr  Anfernee Simons and Nassir Little looking bad and not playing -&gt; Anfernee Simons and Nassir Little looking like passable NBA players and playing  Dame needing to score 60 to win -&gt; Dame can have bad nights and the team still has other scorers and playmakers contributing
Cause Nassir Little is a dog. Stay sleeping
"Last year we started enes Kanter for 30 games and when we didn’t we had Carmelo Anthony and Kanter off the bench. We were average defensively in the games Nurkic played.   This year it’s Larry nance, Cody Zeller, and nassir little(who is turning into a contributor this year). That plus the new defense and guys are trying really hard is making a big difference"
