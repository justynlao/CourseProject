You must be confused Terance Mann was not involved
I can't tell if Terance Mann is smelling his finger or eating his jersey. Either way he's blocking the view
"you can make it work. Pat Bev, Zubac, and either Morris (once he becomes tradeable) or Lou Will/Kabengele/Terance Mann.  i'm honestly not sure if either side would be willing to make that trade, though. it really forces you to decide whether to prefer starpower or depth"

Dont forget Terance Mann at power forward
But that's Terance Mann..?
Terance mann looking at kennards extension and be like I deserve that
Pretty sure they benched him for Terance Mann. What a waste of cap space
"Overrated: Probably Ibaka, at least so far. He's been **fine** but is definitely our weakest starter and Zubac has had a better season overall.  Underrated: You could make a case for Zubac or Batum but I'll go with Terance Mann, who's basically never talked about outside the fandom but is a legitimate rotation player now; he's arguably better than THT tbh."
"Credit to Ty for handling the center rotation far better than his predecessor did.  Ibaka will likely continue to start games but -unless matchups dictate otherwise- Zubac should get the bulk of the minutes.  We also have the luxury of playing Mook as a small ball 5.  Terance Mann has effectively pushed Kennard out of the rotation.  Mann certainly helped his case with strong play on both ends to open the 4th quarter.  He's an inferior outside shooter to Pat Bev but has similar grit and hustle and can defend well against both guards and wings.  Kennard projected to be a long term cover for Lou Williams's offensive production, so I'm reserving judgement on his contract until next season,when Lou will either be gone or given a much smaller role."
Terance Mann is apparently prime Jordan
Watching Terance Mann continue to develop as a viable rotation guy has been pretty fun.
terance mann has become a serious rotation player
What if it's a really big conversation? Cause i have some thoughts on Terance Mann i'd like to discuss.
Terance mann is playing out of his mind. Played kennard out of the rotation
Terance Mann is looking good too
Terance Mann is a rotation guy on the Clippers and he was in the 2nd round
i don't even think Terance Mann knows the answer to that tbh
I think Ty Lue is just gonna keep Terance Mann in there and wait for him to foul out
Terance Mann in early
Terance Mann Marcus Morris Sr.  Serge Ibaka Reggie Jackson Lou Williams  Jimmy Butler Kelly Olynyk Bam Adebayo Duncan Robinson Kendrick Nunn   Starting lineups   Lmao
"Terance Mann is a consistent 3 away from being PatBev 2.0. They had him guard Zach Lavine the other day.  He gets a ton of boards for a guard, but his 3 is just not there yet."
Terance Mann with a casual +21
"The article suggested Bev, Lou Will, Zubac, and Mfiondu Kabengele (25th overall in 2019). I'd also throw in Terance Mann. Not horrible since the Raps could flip Bev for assets, they need some solid bigs like Zu, Lou Will might like playing for his old team with no pressure, and it doesn't hurt to have young projects like Mann and Fi. However, I'd be shocked if that was the highest bid."
that stepback iso 3 by Reginald is exactly the type of shot Terance Mann would not have taken
"Even if rondo doenat play much for the clippers. The fact that lou is gone, opening up minutes for terance mann and Kennard is worth it"
Terance Mann getting national respect wearing that mic
we are all Terance Mann stanns
Terance Mann is going to be a problem for a long time to come. I'm so happy with his growth.
"ggs Nugs  Despite the loss, Terance Mann continues to look better and better."
Terance Mann
UGH I LOVE TERANCE MANN. I HAVE YOUR ROOKIE CARD IN MY WALLET
"it is extremely funny that the national media has been hyping up THT all season (and i do think he has potential) only for terance mann, fellow 2nd-year 2nd-round pick playing in LA, to break out a lot more (with nobody talking about it)"

"Terance Mann on the Clippers is starting to ball, too. Big, long, athletic guard can guard multiple positions, go inside and rebound, attack the rim, he's been looking great the past few weeks."
"Really a complete team effort out there. Kawhi was Kawhi outside of his 3pt shooting, Morris was probably our best player, leading scorer and a +30 on the night. Reggie was a flamethrower in the 3rd, and Luke one upped him in the 4th. Batum continues to always make the right play, and even 2Pat came in and knocked down a few 3's and drew 2 offensive fouls in just a few minutes.   But for me, the ascendance of Terance GROWN Mann is the best part of all of this. He is playing with so much confidence right now, and if he continues to play with that fearlessness in the playoffs, we could do something special.   For now, I'll gladly take blowing out the Bucks without PG tho!"
"the nets signed KD, kyrie, DJ, harden, blake, and aldridge just to beat terance mann and luke kennard. and it won't even work"
Terance Mann pick and roll with Mann as the roll mann lol
Terance Mann is ridiculous. What a pass
"This is why you have PJ Tucker, gotta put him on other teams stars like Terance Mann"
terance fucking mann
*This really is* Terance Mann and Luke Kennard's team right now

"THT or Terance Mann, who has higher ceiling?"
All this to beat Luke Kennard and Terance Mann?
1. Kawhi 2. Paul George 3. Marcus Morris 4. Patrick Beverley 5. Serge Ibaka 6. Ivica Zubac 7. Nicolas Batum 8. Terance Mann 9. Reginald Jackson 10. Luke Kennard
1. Kawhi Leonard             2. Paul George            3. Patrick Beverley              4. Serge Ibaka          5. Marcus Morris         6. Ivica Zubac          7. Nicolas Batum         8. Reggie Jackson         9. Terance Mann         10. Luke Kennard
That’s why I don’t get when people say 2nd round picks are useless in trades lol (heard that a lot when talking about clippers making trades). If your team is good at developing young talent those picks can be very valuable. Luckily we picked up Kenny Atkinson and Billups this summer and it’s done wonders for the young guys on the team. Terance Mann and Amir Coffey are much better players compared to last year. Those two would get big minutes on younger teams
"Terance ""The Man"" Mann."
Mass Native Terance Mann!!
Thats the short version.. Theres an article about how they’ve been scouting him since he was https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/story/2019-10-04/clippers-training-camp-terance-mann%3f_amp=true
Terance trick y’all Mann
Clips been scouting him since he was 13.  His former AAU coach and his mom’s idol are also both on the staff.  (His mom is a women’s college coach btw).  Clips LOVE this kid.

"Hey Clippers fans, what yall think about Terance Mann? Always thought he had what it took to make it at the next level back when he was at FSU, but I'm curious what impression he's made in LA."
I like Terance Mann.  Terrence Mann is cool too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5NzkADigew
Randle by far but my bias will always say Terance Mann.
"Even Cousins and Yogi Ferrell seem to have meshed with the team very quickly. Terance Mann said yesterday they've built a culture where everyone believes in each other and no one points fingers or makes excuses, and that certainly seems to be right."
"There's where the health issue comes into play.  The Clippers has played a lot of games missing 3-4 starters and the team has historically been subpar with Beverley injured.    Beverley has missed half the season  Mook, Serge, Kawhi, PG13 have missed like 1/3 of the season each  The Terance Mann we see today isn't the same player as he was when the season started (player development).    Reggie, Batum, and Zubac are the 3 people you can count on to have played most of the games."

"Remember when Jaren took an elbow 2 minutes later with no call?  Remember when grayson got raked across the arms with no call, then terance mann got the call for the exact same thing 3 possessions after?  I could go on, but it's pointless.  We are a young team, and we get disheartened by things like that.  We just have to grow and learn to compartmentalize."
"2-0 in the Yogi Ferrell era. G-League Clippers are built different, 30 point turnaround in this game, great defense all the way through, and Terance Mann is a joy to watch."
Terance Mann is baby igoudala
Terance Mann is having himself a game
Terance Mann game incoming
what do you mean? terance mann is still playing
Game wasn't as close as the score indicated.  KAT's worse game of the season combined with the most hot three point shooting I've seen against us = gg ff15 go next.  BTW Terance Mann is good.  Haven't watched the Clipper a lot but I was surprised at how well he played.
"Yeah, PG and Terance Mann are our only players who consistently play downhill and get to the rim. That said, we don't usually force the 3; we mostly take them when they're open. Anyway we're top of the league in offensive efficiency so I'm not really worried about that side of the ball."
Terance Mann is a legit 3 point sniper now
"In case you were wondering, the 5 players drafted in 2019 were; Cody Martin (CHA), Terance Mann (LAC), Justin Wright-Foreman (UTH), Marial Shayok (PHI), and Dewan Hernandez (TOR)."
Terance Mann has been killing it for the clippers recently. It's not easy having 20 point games while you're teammates with Kawhi and PG13
i’ve been really pleasantly surprised at how well he seems to get along with our guys both on and off the court. i know the lakers clippers rivalry is mostly fan based but i was worried rondo wouldn’t really like our squad but he’s been making kawhi and pg laugh and always seems to be hanging with and talking to our younger guys too. and on the court his connections with everyone from kawhi and batum to terance mann and pat patterson have been amazing. rondo is such a pro.
"an athletic guard who can get to the rim and defend the other team's fast, shifty guard(s). the dream is if terance mann can develop to fill this role, but i'm not sure if he's really suited to be a reliable point guard defender. maybe the pacers would accept beverley, rondo, and a couple picks for brogdon?"
Terance Mann really is baby igoudala. Winning plays
Terance Mann will be a star.
terance mann 40-point triple double watch
That second sentence is key.  People here don't watch our games so they're missing the important context.  Reggie has the worst shot selection of the bunch but his worst offenses occur within the three point arc.  Even Terance Mann is shooting over 40% from deep (albeit on low volume) even though his biggest weakness as a rookie was his shooting.  He doesn't force anything and the offense gets him wide open looks from the corners.
"Terance Mann, Reggie Jackson, and sometimes Luke Kennard"
Terance Mann at the end of his long 15 year career with the Clippers.
"Can someone tell me more about #14 on the clippers, Terance Mann. He seems pretty good and played well tonight."
Everybody talks about how Paul George had 35 and put the team on his back without Kawhi. But nobody talks about the other players who stepped up like Marcus Morris and Reggie Jackson. Also shout out to Terance Mann for putting a DPOY Gobert on a poster.
I'm so pumped for Terance Mann right now.   I'm an FSU alum and this guy's jersey will one day hang in our rafters. If anyone can step up in the absence of Kawhi it's Terance Mann.
excited for terance mann FMVP
Gobert should’ve watched Terance Mann dunks highlights lol he dunks em strong
WE STAN FOR TERANCE MANN!  GO NOLES!

BBQ CHICKEN FOR TERANCE MANN
TERANCE MANN IS A GROWN MAN
Why did Terance Mann pass up two wide open looks?
"Terance Mann, son of Anita Mann"
terance mann is the love of my life actually
"Terance mann starting tonight, clippers +42 in the series with him in the floor and -12 off"
Terance Mann is starting let’s gooooo
"I think this is wildly overstated. Yes, Bron has much more money than the average player. But on an absolute scale, even the minnows can very much afford to refuse those bags. As an example: Terance Mann was a mid-second round draftee who is still on his rookie deal; his contract is worth over $6m. If he made substantially less this year, he would still be fine and in a much better financial position than virtually all Americans his age."
Easy choice.   We stan for Terance Mann!
Terance Mann is ready to average 15 pts 5 rebs 3.5 assists as soon as next year if Lue will just give him 30 minutes a game.  Mann is my all time favorite Seminole and he could be a star in a bigger role
GOOD THINGS HAPPEN WHEN LUKE KENNARD AND TERANCE MANN ARE ON THE FLOOR
"of course it was, royce was sticking his shoulder out towards Mann. but i think Terance did some theatrics there with the reaction"
#TERANCE MANN
He is actually and we just discovered that also Terance Mann can keep up with Mitchell too
Terance Mann bby ily 🐥
turns out when you play terance mann more than 1 minute you improve your chances!
TERANCE MANN BLOCKED LUKA SO MANY TIMES  HE AINT AFRAID OF NO MITCHELL
Mitchell thought Terance Mann Is ass on defense lol dude blocked Luka so many times
Lue remembered Terance Mann is a player for the Clippers
"If Terance Mann plays less than 5 minutes, Clippers lose.  If Terance Mann plays more than 5 minutes, Clippers win."
I'm just making a Terance Mann/man defense joke not actually critiquing the choice
"I mean.   Ty Lue did go to the Zone, which got them back into the game.   You can't blame Ty Lue for Marcus Morris shitting the bed in both games, Paul George launching bricks until the 4th quarter in game one, or Kahwi disappearing in game 2 in the fourth.  What you can blame Ty Lue for is his line-ups and rotation. For a playoff team, the Clippers have no idea who is going to play in the game and how long they are going to play.   Luke Kennard   * Game 1 - 29 minutes / 18 points  * Game 2 - 10 Minutes / 3 Points  Rajon Rondo   * Game 1 - 28 Minutes / 5-5-6  * Game 2 - DNP  Patrick Beverly  * Game 1 - 6 Minutes 0-1-1  * Game 2 - 20 Minutes 3-3-1  Demarcus Cousins  * Game 1 - 3 minutes / 6 points  * Game 2 - 11 minutes / 6 points  Terance Mann  * Game 1 - 8 Minutes / 2-1-1  * Game 2 - 1 Minute  Nicolas Batum  * Game 1 Started - 20 minutes - 6/4/2  * Game 2 Bench - 27 minutes - 7/3/2  Ivica Zubac  * Game 1 Bench - 20 Minutes - 11 Points  * Game 2 Started - 13 Minutes - 7 Points"
"So Ty Lue *finally* found the right rotation and guys to play in Games 6+7 in that Mavs series (benched Beverley and Rondo, played Mann more and gave Kennard some spot minutes) and literally decides to go away from it in the first 2 games of this series.   I understand the desire to play Zubac more as you can't go small for the full 48 and guys will wear down, esp Batum who is probably going to be gassed at the end of this playoffs, but the guard rotation is inexplicable.   Here are the things T-Lue needs to do with his rotations:  1. Start Batum, put Marcus Morris on the bench, Morris's 3s aren't falling right now and his scoring is better served off the bench when Kawhi + PG aren't playing. Kawhi + PG + Batum have an amazing +/- when they are on the floor together.   2. Bench Pat Bev and play Terance Mann more. Mann gives you exactly what you think Pat Bev is giving you, and the fact that Bev can't make shots anymore drastically reduces his value on the court, the Jazz don't respect him at all and don't guard him. Yeah Mann isn't a great shooter, but he can slash to the rim, he cuts, he puts pressure on the rim, which the Clips need to do to get the Jazz in rotation for those 3s they get off of movement, which is what they do when they're at their best.   3. Play Luke Kennard every second that Donovan Mitchell is not on the floor. He may already be doing this, but I would really make a point of emphasis on doing this, Kennard's shooting is invaluable right now for a team that is struggling to shoot 3s.   4. Like Kennard, Boogie should be out there in every second that Mitchell is not on the floor, he provides useful spacing whilst also being a rim deterrent, and he can also mash Favors in the post when he is out there.   Overall the minutes leaderboard for the Clips should look like this:   1. PG (it's far easier for him to play 40+ minutes than it is for Kawhi who needs more rest)  2. Kawhi  3. Batum (this might exhaust him, but you're going to lose if he doesn't play more minutes)  4. Reggie   5. Mook  6. Mann  7. Kennard  8. Zubac  9. Boogie"
and terance mann played 1 minute in this game after being awesome in the first round
"Reggie Jackson, Batum, Ibaka (if he gets better). Normally Mook, but his shooting has been cheeks. I'd say maybe Terance Mann too."
Beverly should not be playing over Terance Mann.  Lue needs to banish him back to the shadow realm.
"Because they often have a 5th guy on the floor who is a turnstile.  Clips aren't very crisp in their rotations and don't communicate well on help d.  Inconsistency in those areas have been among their biggest weaknesses since last year.  If they're going to continue to play a switch-everything defense, they'll need to play Terance Mann a lot more."
"Terance Mann coined the phrase, 'make love, not war.'"
Terance Mann strongk
PG proud of his son Terance Mann
"Nah, but I saw a lot of him being a barnacle, outside of a couple of dunks, in the corner for most of Game 7. Like I said, he should look inwards for answers also, whether it’s putting a little more effort on defense or finding a way to get to his productive spots on the floor.  One thing is certain, the Mavs are missing a secondary playmaker allow KP to be the focal point when Luka sits. As amazing as Luka was in G6 and G7 did a lot of heavy lifting in the 1H and he was gassed in the 2H of those games and the tough j’s he was hitting earlier in those games were no longer falling. He still kept the team afloat but the diminishing returns certainly showed. Circling back, KP disappeared in 2H of G7 as the Clippers made their run with about 6-7 mins left in 3Q. There just wasn’t a lot of movement in the Mavs offense to free up KP. Some of it may be on the coaching staff, hunting for mismatches (Bobi in the paint, Luka vs Jackson), KP’s own effort, and Clippers defense brilliantly stunting on Luka’s action only to be facing his original defender (Kawhi, Morris, Batum, and PG). At one point, Clippers were happily “defending” him with a 6’3” Terance Mann while he stood in the corner."
"Credit to Lue for identifying and fixing his lineup mistakes before it cost him the series.  Pat Bev and Zu were benched quickly when they became obvious liabilities and -despite being acquired specifically for a playoff run- I'm glad he recognized how little Rondo was bringing to the table this series.  I questioned his decision to give Reggie Jackson a lot of minutes when he was being hunted on defense, but he came through with a big Game 6 and hit a couple of huge bail out shots in Game 7.  His shot selection has been very questionable at times, but he's proven to be a valuable outlet option when Kawhi is getting aggressively double teamed.  Luke Kennard -who came up big this game- figures to be nothing more than a fringe rotation guy as long as Lue prefers Reggie's offensive contributions.  However, Terance Mann should absolutely be given some serious burn starting from the first game of the Jazz series."
and they were saying why did the Clippers hire Kenny Atkinson when they don’t have young prospects and picks. Terance Mann is the future of the NBA
marcus morris is an awesome glue guy on your team too  theres a video from this series of him mic'ed up where he's telling terance mann it's OK he missed a shot nice move kid you're a pro you miss sometimes.   just a nice sentiment from a guy who has been in the NBA a while talking to a young player  he's a real veteran he knows what's up and he'll help you build a good locker room
looking like an amazing 2nd round pick  Who needs 1st overall when you can get terance mann
The man put in two young guys who barely played this series and gave them minutes in key situations and they were ready cause he gave them his trust during the regular season. Those Terance Mann and Luke Kennard minutes swung the game
[found it searching up terance mann](https://twitter.com/TheFrankIsola/status/1401653206199963649)
I can’t get over the fact that Terance Mann was more impactful than KP.   Trade his flat ass Cuban
"Today he was in the low block with 6'5"" Terance Mann on him a couple times and just casually backed up to the corner. If you can't punish that matchup with a low post score or hell even a 15 foot turnaround jumper, what have you been doing all this time? KP could make that shot with us, and you can't even argue declining athleticism cause plenty of guys nowadays learned the formula from Dirk (who was at the game btw)"
"Come on NBA writers, using Terance Mann and Luke Kennard is deus ex machina"

"Suns were a couple of calls that should have been called against them from losing to an injured Clippers team in 6 games. From Mikal Bridges fouling Terance Mann the last minute, to Cam Payne losing the ball all on his own, and then some. They were phony all post season"
Terance Mann has a breakout year averaging 18/8/3 and helps the clippers get to a top 4 seed with no kawhi (who returns a week before the playoffs)  Celtics get their shit together with a new coach and nab the 2 seed  76ers trade Ben Simmons at the trade deadline for dame after the blazers get off to a slow start  Pelicans have two all stars but fail to make it past the play in  LeBron finally Regresses to merely a top 10 player but a (healthy) Lakers team still makes it to the WCF with AD and lonzo carrying them  Suns and jazz do not reach the top 4 seeds at the end of the year  Nuggets get the one seed but lose to the lakers in the second round  Paul George finishes redemption/fuck you arc by winning MVP

"It should have been retired after Terance Mann got the ""mama there goes that ... Mann!"" line vs. Utah.  The catchphrase peaked at that exact moment."
Breakout year for Terance Mann. Should be fun
"Stupid comparison lmaoo. Clips had Terance Mann dropping near 40 points. You think he’s nearly as good as Morant? You also think Valenciunas is as good as Zubac or Boogie?   By the way, THEY LOST. Maybe something works about putting Gobert in the paint against a big instead of on the perimeter?   Gobert apologist really are completely insane. Imagine seeing your 7 footer not be able to score on relative midgets, and then playing the other players who make a fraction of the salary. Delusional"
"I mean PG pops off in the regular season and he’s one of the funnest players to watch so I’ll be entertained along with Terance Mann getting better and it’s not like a bust where we’ll suddenly be a shit team, we’ll make a playoff run it’s just more unpredictable now with the outcome lol"
U sound super insecure about THT (future super bad basketball player) not being as good as Terance Mann (Future #1 goat basketball player) 💯 Get based and grab some common sense bro
People realized Terance Mann better
"Donovan had a better FG% AND eFG% than Booker during the playoffs this year, despite the fact [*18% more* of Donovan's shots were from 3 as compared to Book.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2021_shooting.html)  And even during the regular season, [Booker's eFG% was only 1.3% better than Donovan's](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_totals.html).  I just don't see any way of honestly making the case that Booker is definitively better than Donovan, especially if any such case requires you to ignore the playoffs entirely.  As for the playoff results? Donovan was the sole reason the Jazz got out to a 2-0 lead, and then his ankle injury flared up, the Clippers defense switched to focusing *entirely* on him in game 3, and the Jazz didn't have another high level guard available to counter that strategy. Not to mention that the Jazz split the 2 games with Kawhi, while Booker never once had to go up against Kawhi. Maybe the Jazz should have done better in game 5, but game 6 was Terance Mann having a 70% night from 3. Plus, there's all the well-rehashed stuff about Gobert and the lack of perimeter defense that can't be pinned on Donovan alone."
Gobert isn't the problem. Their perimeter defenders got lazy because Gobert is so good. Terance Mann probably doesn't jack up all those corner 3s if the actual perimeter defenders didn't rely on Rudy to constantly bail them out all season
"Should Dinwiddie continue the shooting numbers we saw in '19-'20, he would **not** fit into the Clippers' mold, because he shoots like shit outside of 10 feet and the guards' ability to spread the floor has become essential to their offense and success. Giving a defense a player to sag off of makes it harder for Kawhi and PG to get going. Pat Bev, Reggie Jackson, Terance Mann all hit threes at 40% clips. Even Reg. Season Rondo in his Clippers games is shooting 43%.  I like Dinwiddie if you can get him that cheap (you can't) but I'm taking Reggie."
&gt;Pat Bev signs for anything less than 9-10 mil a year for an extension. He's worth far more than 5-6 million lol  I don't think there's a strong market for him to get 9-10 mil. Problem with him is that he can't stay healthy and he's also gonna be 34 when his contract is up.   Clippers gonna need to pay Terance Mann and he's most likely gonna replace him in the starting line up sooner rather than later.
"I think it's obvious. I've watched every Jazz game these playoffs, and my conclusion was that Gobert got absolutely exposed.   Gobert has small hands that can't catch the ball even when he gets good position, and his finishes are awkward. Utah almost never fed him when he rolled, and their P&amp;R was getting too predictable.  His interior defense is elite, but he is absolutely ineffective outside the paint, and the only reason Terance Mann got so many wide open shots was because the Clippers offense went at him.  Ayton is extremely mobile for a Center, has a great touch in and outside the paint, and a threat on the P&amp;R."

terance mann was the primary defender on booker in game 1  hence why game 1 was a completely different story  watch the games lol
nothing to see here just developing terance mann in silence
"Jay Scrubb, Clippers, 2nd round pick, missed most of the season due to injury but he showed flashes of being a productive player when he was finally able to play.  He's got good size (6'5"", 6'10"" wingspan), he can handle and shoot, good athlete.  Gave me some Terance Mann vibes.  [Jay Scrubb 17 Points Full Highlights (5/14/2021)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5fnNRmkTGA)"
"It's just become a circlejerk at this point. Ty Lue was getting praised for winning without Kawhi because Reggie Jackson and Terance Mann turned into prime Ray Allen in must win games, but Bud is clueless and getting bailed out by Middleton and Jrue for winning without Giannis."
"I can't think of anyone the Clippers would be willing to part with that the Raptors would choose over any other offers from other teams.  The first question is, what would the Clippers offer? They can't trade any pieces they need for a championship run. I doubt they offer Terance Mann, and they're already in the hole for draft picks. That leaves players like Pat Bev and Rondo. (Conveniently, players the Clippers don't need but can convince themselves other teams should want).  Second question is, do the Raptors even want those players on those contacts? They might be valuable for other teams with different needs, but in my opinion they don't make our team better as currently constructed. Don't fit our roster, our timeline, or our culture. I'm sure plenty of non-Raptors fans disagree and think we should be grateful to take them, but if it was your team you'd probably be just as happy with the front office using that cap space for something else.   Third question is, even if you disagree and think the Raptors should be glad to get a Pat Bev or Rondo out of a S&amp;T -- you don't think the Raptors couldn't get a better offer from one of the other 28 teams? Personally, for several reasons I don't think there's much value in having those two players in our lineup taking away minutes from our strong developing core and bench--I'm sure another team could offer at least an average prospect in return.  It's one thing for the Raptors front office to help Kyle get to a team he likes, but it's another to take contracts that they don't actually want and would hurt the team compared to what else they could get (either in a S&amp;T or free agency). Fans of other teams love to say ""beggars can't be choosers, take what you can get"" until it's their own team, and they see the whole picture of why their team shouldn't bend over backwards to accept the logic of another team.  I come in peace and am prepared for the replies saying my team should be grateful to have Pat Bev over nothing, despite him not fitting at all with our strong developing core and bench."
Clippers sub thinks Mann is a future franchise player. Every team sub is dumb as hell  In quotes: “He is but it’s still his second year that’s why couple more years and he’ll become a franchise player. look at Devin he’s the same age as Terance but spent six years in the league not having a superstar teammate or someone be can learn from on his team and just now has cracked it. TMann has Kawhi and PG from his rookie year so he’ll develop skills faster than Book”
"I like Terance ""The Boat Rocker"" Mann."
"Patrick Beverly, Serge Ibaka, Rondo are all expiring contracts.   They have a valuable young chip in Terance mann for a combined 3.2million over the next two seasons.   They have whomever they draft in the first round this season.   To think they don't have any flexibility in making moves is a bit weird."
"You could say the same for the Clippers. They'll have Serge's contract, Pat Bev's contract, Rondo's contract (all expiring in the 7.5-14m range) they have Terance Mann at a ridiculous 1.7m contract as a trade chip too with an additional team option of 1.9 in 2022-2023.  Clippers set themselves up with a lot of expiring contracts this coming season."
"Do you guys really believe that they league would've preferred a Kawhi-less Clippers team in the finals? They love that Cp3 and Booker (next Kobe) storyline. I also don't wanna here a damn thing about referring cause the Suns lose game 4 if the refs make proper calls in the last minute (Terance Mann and one, Cam Payne out of bounds, Cp3 travel)"
"I hate how Pat Bev's shit is going to take away from how the rest of the team did. PG playing his heart out without Kawhi, Reggie Jackson being damn near automatic, Terance Mann developing into a legit 2-way player. Shit on PatBev but don't let that distract you from how the rest of the team did. They deserve some respect"
"Watching the Clippers flame out yet again tops them both. Paul George's +/- was team worst -25. Pat Bev -16. This is a team who got lucky because Reggie Jackson and Terance Mann had a decent game. Otherwise, they shoulda been gentleman swept and on vacay last week."
"My guy Terance Mann used up all his mojo vs Utah as well.  Still made some big plays this series, but he shrunk way back down from the level he'd been playing at."
Terance Mann is a made man as a good rotation player after this. Love the mentality - strongest mentality on the Clippers tonight.
Terance Mann 😍
Well done Terance Mann.

Reggie being good in the playoffs isn’t a new occurrence. And the Jazz left Terance Mann open that entire game.
&gt;A lot of flukey things happened in the bubble.  Flukier than Reggie Jackson averaging 18 ppg on 63% TS; Kevin Huerter dropping 27 in a game 7 win against the 1 seed; 10 all stars missing games in 1 postseason (previous record was 6); Terance Mann dropping 39 to get to the WCF?  Bubble was amazing compared to this hospital year + breakout performances don't mean the whole bubble was a fluke lol
Uh Terance Mann and Marcus Morris are still playing
It kinda helped us not having lou anymore. Addition by subtraction. Terance mann got a lot of Lou’s minutes.
Forgot about the GOAT Terance Mann. He's the reason they're in the 3rd round
SMH my head the disrespect towards the Clippers and Terance Mann
Can’t wait for the Kevin Huerter vs Terance Mann showdown in the final
"Wait you’re telling me Pat Bev, Reggie Jackson, Terance Mann, etc are better than Facu Campazzo and Austin Rivers???"
"So maybe they weren’t such a bad team? PG who’s number two is on a minimum contract, their only centre left being the husk of demarcus cousins, terance Mann in his 2nd year, and Marcus Morris being injured and playing like ass lol"
Terance Mann might have legitimately taken an NBA title away from Utah.
Love him but the lineup change in Game 4 wasn't really necessary. No need to overthink it. TERANCE MANN NEEDS TO START. The team just plays with energy when he's on the floor. Got them a good start in this game as well too and didn't look back.

I'm not sure. But Terance Mann is.
"Oh shit, you're a Jazz fan. My apologies for yall's collapse two years in a row, must hurt getting blown out by Terance ""grown ass"" Mann 💀💀💀💀"
Terance Mann has one of the worst defensive ratings in this series (109.0). CP3 has to be guarded by a heavier body like PG or Batum (in some possessions the Clippers have tried that and it was pretty successful) that can fight through screens and contest his mid range/deflect his passes.
"I understand the need for Batum, even when he doesn't make his shots he is helping as a glue guy with rebounding, hustle plays etc but what's Terance Mann providing? He has one of the worst defensive ratings of the team in this series (109.0)."
Terance Mann needs to be in the starting line up next game. kid is talented
I think PG is gassed. Ty Lue might need more Terance Mann offense out there. see if he can get a couple of game 6 performances out of him
"Refs did their job, which is to take the attention away from the players and make it all about them with terrible calls  * Terance Mann layup no call * Missed out of bounds on Payne * CP3 travel no call"

Rudy Gobert must be so proud of his father Terance Mann continuing his solid play into the Conference Finals

"A lot of what the Clippers did was just going in desperation mode, playing super hard, outhustling the Suns, getting away with some too physical plays (not the reason we lost), and making some excellent rotations. Don't want to sound condescending but straight up good for them. Also congrats on getting the first conference finals win in franchise history. A lot of franchises have suffered but few if any as much as the Clippers.  On the Suns side this reminded me a lot of game 3 vs the Lakers, when them not being able to execute on offense as well as usual also affected them on the other end. The Clippers shot like humans finally but they got as many open looks as usual in the second half. Lucky for the Suns, in game 4 they were awesome, and I expect them to be this time as well.   Booker was 100% bothered by Beverley but he missed so many shots he always makes. CP3 was frustrating. Having to still play Moore is too, hope Payne is okay.   I have a lot of faith on this team, even if the Clippers tie up this series I will not be too worried. But good for them and hope that we keep responding positively to the next test. Saw a lot of /r/nba slander as usual, I was taken away and acted cocky too in a thread. The Clippers are very good. They won this game without a super hot night from 3, which I thought was their best shot. But this loss was at least a little bit self inflicted. Monty can adjust, we'll see how successfully he does. We still have the most sophisticated pick and roll offense in the league and the Clippers get gassed at times, that was what kept us in the game last night along with DA and Cam Johnson being awesome.  Zubac was awesome too! He's raised his play to the occasion. If they get through us they'll be excited to have him play vs the Bucks and terrified vs Trae+Capela pick and roll lol  We have the mental resolve to answer in game 4 and command the series again, and also to bounce back at home if they get a hot shooting Staples night. Game 4 will be the signifier on if the series is going long or not, basically.   Again, credit to the Clippers for the win. Reggie is awesome, I loved Terance Mann pre-draft but he's like 2-3 years ahead of schedule it's crazy, and Paul George is making up for so much of the slander. But if the Suns play this bad again in the playoffs something has gone terribly wrong."

(Keep in mind that I haven’t even included Conley’s horrid game 6 because he, too, was returning from injury.)   #**Game 5 :**   Marcus Morris Sr. : 25 pts, 10/16 shooting (3/4 from 3)  Reggie Jackson : 22 pts, 8/15 shooting (3/8 from 3)   Jordan Clarkson (second half) : 1 pt, 0/6 shooting (0/4 from 3)  Royce O’Neale (second half) : 4 pts, 1/7 shooting (0/5 from 3), 4 PF, -14 in 20:14  Utah Jazz (second half, Mitchell’s stats not included) : 10/29 from the field (34.5%), 2/15 from 3 (13.3%)  Utah Jazz (second half, Mitchell’s stats included) : 13/43 from the field (30.2%), 3/24 from 3 (12.5%)  Utah Jazz (full game, Mitchell’s stats not included) : 14/21 from the FT line (66.7%), 10 AST, 12 TO (AST:TO = 0.83), 18 pts off TO  Utah Jazz (full game, Mitchell’s stats included) : 19/27 from the FT line (70.4%), 15 AST, 14 TO (AST:TO = 1.07), 20 pts off TO   #**Game 6 :**   Terance Mann (second career playoff start) : 39 pts, 15/21 shooting (7/10 from 3)  Reggie Jackson : 27 pts, 10/16 shooting (3/7 from 3), 3 stl  Los Angeles Clippers (second half) : 30/42 from the field (71.4%), 14/19 from 3 (73.7%)   Rudy Gobert (second half) : 6 pts, 2/2 shooting (0/0 from 3), 6 reb, 3 PF, 2 TO, -34 in 24:00  Rudy Gobert (full game) : 12 pts, 5/6 shooting (0/0 from 3), 10 reb, 2 stl, 5 PF, 3 TO, -24 in 42:08  Jordan Clarkson (second half) : 0 pts, 0/4 shooting (0/3 from 3), -25 in 10:42  Joe Ingles (3rd quarter) - 0 pts, 0/2 shooting (0/2 from 3), 2 AST, -17 in 06:18  Utah Jazz (second half, Mitchell’s stats not included) : 11/26 from the field (42.3%), 5/17 from 3 (29.4%), 5 AST, 10 TO (AST:TO = 0.5)  Utah Jazz (second half, Mitchell’s stats included) : 15/39 from the field (38.5%), 9/25 from 3 (36.0%), 10 AST, 11 TO (AST:TO = 0.91)  Utah Jazz (full game, Mitchell’s stats not included) : 27 pts conceded off TO, 8/10 from the FT line (80%), 10 AST, 14 TO (AST:TO = 0.71)  Utah Jazz (full game, Mitchell’s stats included) 29 pts conceded off TO, 14/19 from the FT line (73.7%), 19 AST, 16 TO (AST:TO = 1.19)  Biggest lead : Utah Jazz (25, 11:36 left in 3Q)   Given all of that, are you really still gonna sit here and say that the main reason you lost the series was because of an ankle injury to a guy who **averaged 30/7/7 over the last 2 games anyway**? Y’all didn’t lose because of that - **y’all lost because the team played like shit**."
"ok series is 2-2. no conley for Utah, no Kawhi for the Clippers. I think we know which team is missing a much better player.  The last game, the Jazz are up a bunch. Utah gets cooked by Terance Mann and Reggie Jackson.   I'd go for the whole ""Mitchell was dealing with an injury"" thing if dude didn't average 35 that series"
this guy is friends with terance mann
what a nice Jazz team. Surely they won’t give up 39 points to Terance Mann in a season ending losss
Terance Mann
I don’t see Bledsoe staying whether he plays well or not tbh. Gotta pay Terance Mann next season
The clippers drafted 3 Guards. This trade is to open up a starting position for terance Mann and give minutes to the rookies

That's Terance Mann to you

2019: Terance Mann is better than THT and has shown it on a bigger stage
Outside of THT and hes impressive layups i would say Terance Mann is betterr
terance mann hasnt done anything outside of one playoff game and is like 5 years older than THT
Terance Mann literally dropped 39 in a close out game to go to the WCF I think he’s better than THT
Nah  The Terance Mann 39 point game to send us to our first WCF was more hype and emotional than any Lob City moment except for CP3's Game 7 gamewinner against the Spurs. And even that is kinda spoiled because the very next series is the blown 3-1 lead against Houston.   I think most Clipper fans would agree that last year's team beats out any Lob City iteration. For me personally last years squad is tied with the 2006 squad as my favorite of all time.
"Terance Mann, Nickeil Walker-Alexander, Rui Hachimura (he’s gonna be amazing tbh), De’Andre Hunter, Lonnie Walker, Cole Anthony, Patrick Williams, And Jaren Jackson Jr (I already think he’s good but he’s going to put people on notice)."

Cancar must've watched too many Terance Mann highlights.
"lol yep, jazz fans won’t admit it tho cause their players were injured when they were choking and let terance mann eliminate them"
Am I crazy for thinking it's not consensus that the Clippers will make the playoffs? Their best player is out the whole season. Paul George is guaranteed to miss games for load management and also has a big injury history. Terance Mann looked great but he's expected to take a pretty big leap in production based on a small sample size.
"the following players are all better than any of your roleplayers, in most cases significantly:  * Nic Batum  * Marcus Morris  * Ivica Zubac  * Yes, Serge Ibaka  * Reggie Jackson (if he re-signs)  The following players are at least as good as any of your roleplayers:  * Terance Mann  * Luke Kennard  In general, not only do we have shooters at least as good as yours, but unlike you, ours can also defend."
Cool. 2 firsts and Terance Mann should do the trick.
"Terance ""The Boat Rocker"" Mann"
How is this the same Gobert that Terance Mann and Reggie Jackson were taking turns abusing for us?
"Not that crazy when you think about it.  Rubio played a role for Spain that he has never really had to play in the NBA.  I mean look at how a guy like Terance Mann was able to put up a crazy scoring performance in a closeout game when he was taken out of his usual limited role.  The floor of NBA talent has been raised significantly, even as there are still super elite players (LeBron, KD, Jokic, etc.) that can singlehandedly swing outcomes for their teams."
"It all depends on everyone's health as well as Terance Mann and Luke Kennard's growth.   Some teams were outrageously healthy last season - will they be the same this season?   Assuming every team stays perfectly healthy throughout the season - I would place them in the sixth seed. Lakers, Warriors, Jazz, Nuggets, Suns ahead and they'd be clustered with Portland and Dallas."

FIBA has no defensive 3 second rule. that's why Gobert sat in the paint. we wouldn't drive against him.  Terance Mann did during the playoffs. you have Clippers flair.  best example of what needs to be done is from YOUR OWN TEAM.

Terance Mann was 48th overall. you can never just assume they’ll be bust
fun fact:  Terance Mann (38.5) had a higher vertical at the combine than Blake Griffin (35.5).    Both pale in comparison to Keon (48).
Reggie Jackson and Terance Mann were right there.
"Gray is a unique player. He looks a little overweight but it tricks the guy he’s guarding because Gray has really quick feet. He’s a great one on one defender, and he can guard every position 1-5. Though in the League it’s probably more 1-4.   He’s got really quick hands for steals. He has a nice handle and passing ability, he spent a decent amount of time running our offense. He’s excellent in transition.   A lot of people will do Draymond Green comps but he’s really a poor man’s Zion Williamson (obviously nowhere near as good, but in terms of play style). I like Gray a lot and I think he sticks in the league. He does a lot of little things well that lead to winning basketball (which is something I used to say about Terance Mann)."
"They say he's a freak athlete, excellent defensive potential, pretty raw on offense.  Sounds like he could be a younger, more raw Terance Mann."
"I'll save you a Google, he's not related to Terance Mann"
"You can never be salty at an underdog overachieving, unless it's against your team.  Seeing the Jazz get bounced by the GOAT Terance Mann was amazing."
Clippers trade for a vet and send out Terance Mann as a part of the package.

They should go after Terance Mann for some future picks the Clippers are lacking right now.
Team USA should’ve called up Terance Mann for the specific purpose of tilting Gobert smh.
Sounds like they need Terance Mann
I hate watching him play for Team USA. He’s been an embarrassment every time he plays for us. At this point I’m calling up Terance Mann at least he’s not scared of Gobert.
they needed a guy who can go at Gobert  like Terance Mann
They've been leaving him open on purpose he needs to Terance Mann them.

"Raised: Terance Mann, Trae Young, Deandre Ayton, (bonus: Cam Johnson)  Dropped: Ben Simmons, Julius Randle, Kristaps Porzingis"
Depends on 'young' but there's a few others:  * Bobby Portis (26) might not have played inn the Brooklyn series but was huge when Giannis went down and proved his worth in the conference finals and finals.  * Onyeka Okongwu (20) showcased some really strong defense against Giannis  * Basically the entire Atlanta Hawks team  * Terance Mann (24)  * Dillon Brooks (25)   I've probably missed some but those are the ones that stood out to me
The Terance Mann game
So a Terance Mann performance then.
"the jazz really need to figure out perimeter defense. Clippers won because all 5 can shoot but Gobert solely protects the rim, so its essentially leaving one person open. Sometimes it works, other times you get cooked by terance mann"
Terance Mann MIP season incoming.
"That fact that you said Terance mann hung 40 on his neck absolutely proves me point, that you do not watch the Jazz play. Again, scheme was to let them shoot 3s and guard the paint, which is exactly how Mann scored 40 lol.   *Gobert defended 1,335 shots this year, 184 more than anyone else. The 267 3-point shots he defended are the fourth most among 67 NBA Centers, and also more than Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Marcus Smart, OG Anunoby, and Kawhi Leonard. He’s defended the seventh most shots in isolation (78), and the most shots attempted on cuts to the basket (229). It’s safe to say Gobert puts himself out there in terms of guarding every player on every play more than anyone in the league.*  Here's one of the many articles you can find that show what you are saying is just blatantly wrong.  https://saltcityhoops.com/dispelling-myths-aroung-goberts-defense/  Homer or not, my point &gt; yours. lol"
Anyone except Terance Mann. My heart couldn't take it.
God bless Terance Mann.

"Well, yes, Terance Mann but it was a dumb argument"
"&gt;stock their cupboard  They've already started.  Their strategy is to buy up a ton of 2nd round picks and take chances on high risk high ceiling players that fell in the draft.  If they can keep converting a few of those picks into Terance Mann type successes, they'll be in good shape."
I’ll ask PG or Kawhi if they can take a pic of me with Terance Mann
"I might be willing to trade Terance Mann for Gobert, if only for the conversation of ""so who did you trade me for? Kawhi right?"""
"I like what Ralph Lawler said: we are a tier 2 PG away from winning the championship. We don't need to swing for Lillard/Curry type of tier 1 PG. We can go for a tier 2 type of PG. Wall can potentially be that if his health hasn't derailed him. Kawhi and PG make us championship contenders. But having a tier 2 PG that can playmake, be a leader, defend, and have a jumpshot/shoot the 3 when plays break down is what we have been looking for.  As for trading for a star PG, the worst part is that Ralph said we have to be ready to give up Terance Mann. And honestly, he's right. Mann's stock is at an all time high. He's talented and a hard worker but realistically he won't be a star player. We have other rookies that Houston might like in BJ Boston and Keon Johnson. Both are high upside players but also low floors."
"Defense is usually effort, not surprising he was giving poor effort in NOLA.    &gt;He also hasn't been good in the P&amp;R, which is the bread and butter of his ""ball-handling"", since Phoenix. In  This could be because Phoenix was the last properly spaced team he played on.  Milwaukee, even this year was shooting like 30% from 3 in the 2nd round and Holiday was struggling mightily to score, the offense in general was.   LA has proper spacing &amp; needs a slashing guard, Terance Mann pushed the pace for them last year and he made the offense come alive even when he wasn't scoring just the fact that he was pushing the pace."
KAT wouldn't get outplayed by Terance Mann
Terance Mann especially if Kawhi is out
"Is it unfair to say Terance Mann in game 6 against the Jazz? 39 points against one of the best defences in the league. His next highest score in a playoff game is 13. He only has 4 scores over 20 (25, 23, 21, 20) in any game."
"terance mann until he proves otherwise by becoming a solid starter (or 6th man) at least, i guess?"
"While we're on the topic of those dastardly Cloppers... it's kind of insane that Paul George's 36 was their best in any of last season's 72 games, arguably not much for as good a season as they had.  So how many times did a member of this team top PG's regular season record in the playoffs, given only 19 playoff games?  * Kawhi Leonard 45 * Kawhi Leonard 41 * Paul George 41 * Paul George 37 * Terance Mann 39"
Terance Mann
"While Luke will surely do better in 2021-2022 with opportunities for consistent playing time, Terance Mann projects to be the real breakout player during Kawhi's absence.  I'm not talking Game 6 vs. Utah, but he can certainly average 14-16 ppg while doing all the extra things that coaches love (esp. defense and hustle rebounds).  I can see the Thunder being like the Bobcats with their draft lottery luck: consistently missing out on the top picks despite having awful records.  Or maybe it's karma for playing a non-competitive team for half the season and expecting to get rewarded for it.  It was mildly amusing to see Thunder fans throw a hissy fit when they got out-tanked in the last game of the season; especially coming after they'd been making a mockery of the competitive element of professional sports."
Don't forget Terance Mann!
It’s hard. Terance Mann and Reggie Jackson are both stars.
Any Ty Lue slander for not 'believing' in any of his players from last year is straight garbage. Lue let Terance Mann and Reggie Jackson (two guys nobody had faith in before last season) play massive minutes and didn't hesitate to experiment with lineups that utilized our entire bench.

"Seriously, where did that defense go? They went from holding Harden under 55 TS% in back-to-back years in the playoffs to one of the worst playoff defenses dare I say ever, in a matter of 2 years. They legit made Terance Mann and Dillon Brooks look like elite offensive players this past playoffs."
Terance Mann and Luke Kennard will both average more than 10 ppg this season.
"Watching all the reddit stat nerds crap on Mitchell to prop up Gobert all season was honestly the most frustrating shit ever. Once playoffs rolled around and Spida started routinely dropping 30 bombs on a bum ankle and Rudy got cooked by Terance Mann(lmfao) and Reggie Jackson in game 6 they all shut the hell up for a day or two which was nice.  Donovan Mitchell is the best player on the Utah Jazz, end of story."
Terance Mann or Tyrece Maxey
"I mean if you think about it like a computer:  Expectation: Clippers beat Jazz  Result: Clippers beat Jazz   Conclusion: I was right and not surprised  Idk I wasn't as invested in that series so I didn't have much of a reaction other than ""How tf did you blow a 28 point lead to Terance Mann and Reggie Jackson"". If I watched it live maybe I'd have a stronger reaction but I turned the game off and went to sleep at halftime thinking ""I'll stay up for game 7"". One of my bigger regrets this postseason 😭😭"
Terance Mann at +10000 would be my bet. With Kawhi’s year in question it’s not unreasonable Mann plays around 30 MPG and if he can get to 15-16 PPG he would be in the conversation.
Didn't donovan drop like 40 in that game 6? Not his fault. Doesn't excuse blowing a 25 point lead to Terance mann

Terance Mann was 48th and look what happened last year. Players just need opportunity to play in crucial minutes
"Ty Lue should have put somebody bigger in Terance Mann's spot. Mann could have been in the perfect position to get the rebound if he was bigger, before he backed out of scrummage (most likely because he was smaller)"
Terance Mann led the team in minutes!   When that guy is on the court then good things tend to happen. Would've liked to see him look for his own shot a bit more down the stretch though.
Can't wait for Terance Mann to win 6th Mann of the Year.

AD is the centerpiece of what I think will be the Association's best defense.   Cade will post the best counting stats among rookies. He won't be as efficient as Davion Mitchell but he'll still get ROY.  IQ is in a great situation and I think Rose and Ingles will miss time while Clarkson will be way too inefficient to win it again. I also don't have the Jazz as a top 4 seed.  Mann should get a lot of usage and I think get like 19 ppg.  Timberwolves gonna have home court advantage in the first round of the playoffs out west. Finch ain't the reason but he'll get some credit for it."

Terance Mann most improved player
"&gt;**Over the past four regular seasons, the Jazz allowed only 0.8 points per pick-and-roll defended by Gobert, best in the NBA, according to Second Spectrum.** That number is backed by opposing coaches, who consider him the best pick-and-roll defender in the league. He ranks highly in virtually every statistical category on defense, too. But his effect on the game has been diminished in the playoffs, since teams regularly downsize to put as much skill on the court. Opposing offenses space the floor with five shooters, all with the intent of pulling Gobert away from the interior and toward the 3-point line. So when players dribble by his teammates, he can’t be in a position to stop them like he normally would be. And if he lets his mark shoot freely in order to station himself near the hoop, you can wind up in a situation like in Game 6 against the Clippers, when Terance Mann suddenly became prime Ray Allen and knocked Utah out of the playoffs.  --- &gt;The Clippers shot 46.1 percent from 3 after the Jazz went up 2-0; not even the doll from Squid Game could have eliminated them.  lol"

"He has a lot of potential but I don't think he is worth 11 million a year.  Then again, the Clippers gave Luke Kennard 13 million a year and I would rather have Terance Mann, 100%.  11 mil a year is basically top 120 in the NBA pay.  He don't usually start, he is basically a 7-10th man bench player and you are giving him 11 million.  That is starter pay for someone who just isn't good enough, and he really shouldn't get more than 5-7 mil a year until he actually proves he deserves to be in that 4th 5th 6th mann(lol) catagory.  I think the Clippers overpay both Kennard and Mann, but good for them for being able to get that sort of pay."

"This was one of my favorite parts of last season:  &gt; On the complete opposite end of the spectrum, there’s Bruce Brown.4 Brown and childhood friend Terance Mann essentially invented a position last season, which I have elected to call the Biggie Small. At 6-foot-4 and 202 pounds, Brown is the size of a guard — which makes sense, because he played point guard and shooting guard growing up, at the University of Miami and in his first two NBA seasons. But the Nets decided he was going to play like a center on offense, and the results were awesome.  &gt; Defenses simply did not know what to do with this guy when he set a screen and rolled into the paint, or when he camped out in the dunker spot, or when he cut from an odd angle into the middle of the lane for an easy floater. It’s practically unheard of for a Brown-sized player to set 34 screens per 100 possessions, as Brown did during the playoffs, but when it keeps working, why not just keep going to it? Among the 277 instances of a player setting at least 100 ball-screens during a playoff run over the past eight years, Brown’s 2020-21 run ranked fourth in points per possession."

"most people will tell you the perimeter defense was definitely the issue (unless they don't watch basketball), but Gobert not being able to punish smaller defenders on the other end didn't help either.

Now I'm told people want Terance Mann.
"I saw Terance Mann at the grocery store today  I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.  He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”  I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.  The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.  When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."

"1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett 4. DeAndre Hunter  5. Darius Garland  6. Tyler Herro  7. PJ Washington  8. Rui Hachimura 9. Brandon Clarke  10. Matisse Thybulle 11. Keldon Johnson  12. Kevin Porter Jr   I'd take all of those guys ahead of him for sure, and then the debate for thw other two top-14 spots is between:  * Jordan Poole * Nickeil Alexander-Walker * Cam Johnson  * Cam Reddish * Darius Bazley * Nicolas Claxton * Terance Mann  * Lu Dort (whowent undrafted)  There's definitely a debate to be had, but I'd be leaning Cam Johnson and Lu Dort."

"Terance Mann became a man(n) in the playoffs.  He went from passing up an open layup in crunch time in the Mavs series to taking 21 shots in a closeout game in the Jazz series.  He made his mistakes, learned from them, and stood tall when it mattered. My Mann."
"Only an elite offensive player for 2 years? Bullshit. The stats have said Jokic has been an elite offensive player literally since he started playing in the NBA.  He was also the first team All NBA center 3 years ago so you're full of shit.  Last - this idea that Kawhi had to carry the Clips offense more than Jokic had to carry the Nuggets in the playoffs is straight up *wild* considering, again, PG13 exists, and was healthy. PG averaged 29 against the Mavs so is he also an all time offensive player? 9.5 boards and 5 apg too (slightly more than Kawhi did on that front). Reggie Jackson meanwhile averaged 18 ppg against the Mavs.  For comparison, the Nuggets next highest scorers against the Blazers after Jokic (again, 33 ppg) were MPJ - 18 ppg, and Monte Morris, 15 ppg and Aaron Gordon, 12 ppg vs Portland. Everyone else was 10 ppg or below for the Nuggets vs Portland. Not a single other player averaged double figures. Marcus Morris averaged 13 ppg for the Clips, Terance Mann 10, to go along with those PG + Reggie Jackson. It's not a close comparison here as to who had to shoulder a larger burden on offense. Not even a little close."

Yes because a guard (who carried your offense) being a bad defender should torpedo an entire team's defense.

"Terance Mann, hands down."
"A few of those Clipper guys who went off in the playoffs last year: Reggie Jackson, Terance Mann"
Terance Mann!   How many players in NBA history can say they had 39 points in a playoff closeout win?
"Your friend had an agenda and was being disingenuous.  I was pushing back against their disingenuousness.  There's no way that a reasonable person would say that  Draymond, Wiggins, Poole, Lee, Iguodala, Looney, Bjelica, Porter, Payton  have less talent as a group than  Reggie Jackson, Nic Batum, Terance Mann, Eric Bledsoe, Luke Kennard, Ivica Zubac, Isaiah Hartenstein  Those are all the players (Steph and PG excluded) that have played a minimum of 150 minutes for each team.  You may notice that GSW has 9 names and the Clips have 7.  Here's the thing.  If you guys want to push an agenda, don't do it while misrepresenting what is happening with other teams.  The Cips aren't some stacked roster.  Don't tell lies about us."
"man, duncan's going full terance mann on the jazz"
terance mann
"even if Ibaka gets healthy, I'm not sure how you can keep Hartenstein off the floor. Dude is a major impact player at this point for the clippers. He like Terance Mann just makes winning plays all the time (aside from his fouling)"
"Clippers Nets is accurate, even Terance Mann and Bruce Brown are best friends"
"I maybe should have mentioned that without Kawhi, the Clip's SF rotation is basically PG and Terance Mann.  Mann plays PF in some lineups too.  Three guys (Reggie, PG, and Mann) are being asked to do a lot right now.  They can't afford to play Bledsoe less minutes especially with Morris's injury and Winslow out of the rotation."
"Clippers don't have a lot of guard depth.  Reggie is averaging a career high in minutes per game by 3 minutes, Terance Mann is playing over 30 mpg off the bench, Luke Kennard is at around 27 mpg.  Minus Bledsoe, that's the Clips guard rotation and Terance plays some of those minutes at forward too.  Clips are pretty thin."
"if electrifying performance was the mvp decider, terance mann would sweep"
Sometimes I get confused between Tyrese Maxey and Terance Mann. Ohh they are both TM lol
why does bumsoe start over terance mann
"Zubac said I can’t even remember what I ate for breakfast, who’s this PG and Terance Mann you speak of?"
"The Nets have guarded really well going back to the playoffs with Brown-Harden-Harris-KD-Griffin.  I think they shouldn't touch that starting lineup as long as those guys are healthy.  Insert Kyrie for Harris if he comes back.  I get the intrigue with Claxton, but when they had him as the 5, Griffin was forced to guard more on the perimeter and Claxton was often late getting back in transition (though not the only one).  Plus if Griffin is going to play on the perimeter on offense, his handle, passing, and shooting are much more of pluses at the 5.  The ball moves faster with this group.  Mann and Kennard continue to kill other teams' benches.  At some point I think the Clippers might have to be quicker to get to their best lineups, though I give Tyronn Lue credit for figuring out last year in the playoffs that their best lineups included Mann with Batum at the 5, and going back to that in games this year.  Paul George is not a great passer, the reads get tougher and he has been very turnover prone with Zubac at the 5 and Bledsoe basically being a non-shooter.  Bledsoe is also not really taking the playmaking burden off of George's shoulders right now.  Terance Mann might be their second best player.  Zubac individually is a solid player, but I think their defense is at its best when they have 5 quick players pressing and trapping and playing on a string"
"That was the worst day in my life, I remember “my” girl left with another dude and I was like, well at least Gobert is cooking these bums, Terance Mann 3s… I got to my house crying.  Edit: I was watching the game at a church, for context."
He’s not wrong. They were pretty much in control whenever he was in the game until we got momentum in the 4th quarter. S/O to Terance Mann
I love Terance Mann
FFS PLAY TERANCE MANN
[Terance Mann doesn't](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/q6qs0r/farbod_terance_mann_on_seeing_patrick_beverley_in/)
"Terance Mann needs to get back in the gym and practice his shots more. 30 minutes on the floor, with only 13 points? Dude has a ton of potential and needs to keep progressing his game. This year he's getting a chance to prove himself and grow as a talent."
"I agree somewhat, but honestly when one is attacking, and the other is chucking up 3's, the calls are going to favor the more aggressive team. Plus it doesn't help that every time KAT thought he was fouled, he cries. I think the refs are just sick of it and decided to swallow their whistle.  Anyways, Terance Mann- what a player. So jealous you guys found a stud like him while we continue to draft trash."
That Terance Mann rebound was embarrassing
Terance mann is mini igoudala
"Our shooting has been abysmal until the last game, and we've had a lot of open looks too. Hopefully that ends up evening out.  Also, Ty needs to bench Bledsoe for Terance Mann asap."
"I'd agree the Chris Paul shot is number one.  The Terance Mann game for me is way better than the Warriors comeback though, in terms of impact and how fun the game itself was. Always knew we were gunna lose that series anyway."
"I'm a different guy from the one who said the Jazz have a ""terrible construction.""  I think the Jazz have a very good roster construction, but that there's a clear weak spot that the Jazz have not yet been able to solve. You don't play effectively against great teams like the Bucks, who run through a wing/forward, nor do you beat the Clippers with Kawhi twice, unless you have one of the best rosters in the league. You just also don't surrender two 50 point games in the same series to Jamal Murray, or 39 points to Terance Mann, or three 20 point games from Reggie Jackson, unless you have a weak point."
"Don’t worry, Terance Mann seems to have descended from his Jesus level, for now"
you blew a 25-point lead to Terance Mann
Terance Mann is a difference maker and future star.  He gives the Clippers something to hope for for the future regardless of the outcome of this series.
Ty Lue riding terance Mann hard
"Terance Mann 2 points, 3 rebounds +21"
Terance Mann +21  Not an accident
Terance Mann is going to be replacing pat bev next year as starter
Terance mann literally just saved the clippers season
Terance mann
Willie just clotheslined from hell terance Mann right there
Terance Mann comes in good things happen
"It annoys me that the clippers abandoned all their ball movement and driving during the regular season and just reverted to this their bubble lineups and offense.  Like why did they trade Lou to play Rondo only 19 minutes but Reggie (30!). Zubac is obviously limited skill wise and Trezz was a liability on defense so they get Ibaka and he goes on to play 6 minutes. Batum, who was 4th in winshares on the team is not being involved enough. Terance Mann is a dynamic young wing who sparks the Clippers consistently and Lue didn’t bring him out until it was nearly too late.  Zubac, Reggie and Beverley need their roles altered or it’s over."
play terance mann more instead of reggie.
Terance Mann gonna get 40 minutes in game 3
Terance Mann should have been playing instead of Reggie
Free terance Mann
Free terance Mann
Trust me when I say Clipper fans want to see more Luke and Terance Mann.
Kawhi's backup is Terance Mann. Dude needs minutes
That guy makes so many boneheaded plays. Terance Mann already looks way better than him.

"no Terance Mann the Clipper, not Terrence Mann the actor."
I constantly keep getting Tyrese Maxey and Terance Mann mixed up. They look and play identical.
I mean they have Terance Mann at least 😅
"Well the Clippers drafted Terance Mann, so they also have a home-grown superstar"
"I'll tell you what, Terance Mann has proved me wrong. Maybe he is just having a good couple games but hes shooting lights out behind the arc. I always wondered why the Clippers played Mann instead of Kennard since theyre the same height and i always deemed Kennard a wayyy better offensive threat. Maybe i was wrong... Paul George even said in the post game interview the other night that they all knew he could shoot and that they keep telling him to shoot. Maybe the kids lights out but just didnt have the confidence. Either way hes fun to watch."
"clippers drafted their superstar terance mann, what are you talking about?"
Terance Mann needs to take more shots
Only difference is that Game 6 will be the Luke Kennard game instead of the Terance Mann game.
So apparently guarding Terance Mann is a good idea

"I bet on Clippers in games 2,3 &amp; 4 against the Jazz despite them not being big underdogs after Kawhi went down.  Safe to say Terance Mann is my new favourite non-Celtic."
If Terance Mann is starting ITS OVAAA
I expect to see a lot of Luke Kennard.  We just had the Terance Mann game.  What we need now is the Luke Kennard game.
"Bucks or Suns, Hawks third bc that would be crazy, Clippers probably fourth bc they show a lot of heart in these playoffs and Terance Mann is a great story so I wouldn't mind honestly, dont care about the Sixers"
What’s really been great about these playoffs is seeing some non-superstars step up and really contribute. Bruce Brown has shown out. Terance Mann just went nuts. Tyrese Maxey saved the Sixers from elimination.
Terance Mann?
"Terance Mann the Myth the Legend VS Cameron ""Laker Slayer"" Payne."
Terance Mann and Reggie Jackson are the greatest duo in NBA history
"To be fair, the last two games were the first time PG actually led a playoff team with a competent performance in like 6 years. Piggybacking off Kawhi and now Terance Mann of all people after complaining about Dame eliminating him while he piggybacked off of Westbrook makes it rather hard to really respect a player like him. No offense"
I forgot about Terance Mann
"My Mann only has one 'r' in his first name. Also, the second vowel is an 'a'. Terance."
The Bucks played Bryant in garbage time and when Pat was getting stitches. Donte and Pat being out doesn’t give you a lot of guards to choose from. The Bucks played essentially 6 dudes games 4-7. The Clippers literally just won a series clincher because of Terance Mann I don’t see anyone saying Tyron Lue is an idiot.   If the Bucks had lost the narrative would have been Bud is stupid for it playing Portis more. The narrative around him is so toxic that anything positive that happens is not because of him and anything negative is 100% his fault. I’m not out here blaming Nash and Dantoni because Joe Harris forgot how to shoot.
Otherwise: Terance Mann
Terance Mann
"If Kawhi is healthy, and Paul George is Playoff P, and Terance Mann replicates his game 7... Clippers ain't losing to anybody"
"If they beat the Suns they win it all.   Suns have a deep rotation and I find that there is no ""bad player"" in their rotation.  Clippers have Nic Batum (who is inconsistent at times), Luke Kennard (BBQ chicken), Terance Mann (rookie)"
"Despite the tough loss there's no doubt Kevin Durant is the best player in the league. After Terance Mann, that is."
- Death  - Taxes  - Terance Mann  - Injuries in the playoffs
"Jrue Holiday played like Eric Bledsoe in the first 3 quarters  And then like Terance ""The Fucking"" Mann in the 4th"
" Despite the tough loss there's no doubt Kevin Durant is the best player in the league. After Terance Mann, that is."
If you told me Terance Mann would play better than Joe Harris I would have asked you what strain you bought.  But fr I’ll take recs.
Terance Mann would scorch both of these teams
Harden thinks he's terance Mann but he's shooting so much worse he looks more like steph curry.
"Good job, you know how to multiply percentages.  Now take a second and think about whether Terance Mann is actually as effective on offense as Zion Williamson, or if maybe there could be some sort of small sample size bias with that 42% number."
Broke: This game needs Reggie Jackson  Woke: This game needs Terance Mann
TERANCE MANN  CAMERON PAYNE  ITS THE WESTERN CONFERENCE FINALS ON ABC
"This whole situation is a misnomer. Gobert did adjust. Early in the 3rd, Mann made his first real corner 3 off ambitious help by Gobert. Okay, fair, they're still up 20. Reggie layup, couple turnovers, Mann gets loose in transition, up 14.  Little later, Gobert helps onto a literal wide open layup, giving up an open 3 -- but you take a ~45% corner 3 over a ~95% wide open layup. Still, up 12. Turnover. Up 10. Same situation -- Gobert covers a wide open layup, gives up a  corner 3.  Up 7. Clarkson dumb foul. Up 5.  Turnover. Corner 3. Up 2.  Around here you can see the adjustment and Gobert actually closes out well to a Mann 3, but he's hot, so it doesn't matter. They end the quarter up 3. In the 4th, the story is similar, but it gets worse because Gobert routinely doesn't help as aggressively due to his concern and ends up being too late to meaningfully impact the play. Yeah, there's the one meme shot where everyone's standing around as Mann shoots a corner 3 -- that's probably the only time he was left open in the quarter, and it was a really damn good pass to hit him off a layup that would otherwise be wide open. You need to shoot 65% from 3 to be more valuable than a literal wide open layup. Not practical.  The majority of these buckets were in transition; a lot of them were wide open layups generated by perimeter penetration. If Gobert does not help, there would be threads saying ""Oh, why didn't he help off career 1.4 3PA attempted Terance Mann to help guard the rim? You're paid $200 mil to guard the rim and you're giving up wide open layups!""  The real issue is two fold.  One, Clarkson, injured Mitchell and even at points Royce gave up penetration on the most bitchmade shit. There's a section in the 4th where Gobert is iso'd on by PG13, completely locks him down, and then the next possession Mitchell gets the same iso, gives up the easiest blowby, and it's either a wide open layup or a corner 3.  Why is it a corner 3? It's not Gobert's fault. The only players in all of NBA history who can effectively go from covering the rim vs downhill players to covering their man in the corner are like, prime KG, prime Hakeem, prime Bill Russell. Maybe Draymond. Nobody else in the league can do that, and nobody can do it as a regular play twenty times in a half.  So how do you guard it? You -rotate.- When the center goes to help at the rim, the perimeter players shift to accomodate, with one person going to the corner, then someone shifts to guard their man, then the guy who was blown by shifts to guard the other man. This leads to more complicated sequences. Is this good? No, not necessarily, high quality motion can generate open shots. But it's obviously better than not challenging the defense.  The Jazz can do this. They have smart defenders in Royce and Ingles. They have Mitchell, who has the physical tools to be a good defender. Bojan should be able to at least /try/.  Did they do this?  No. Not once.  That's why they lost. Not ""Gobert is a fraud!"" -- their perimeter defense was fundamentally incapable of guarding 5 out, and whether it's Gobert out there or they run Conley/Clarkson/Mitchell/Bojan/Ingles, it's the exact same shit.  (And before you say, ""But Gobert is a negative offensively!"" -- he didn't have his best half, partially due to the superhuman effort -trying- to cover the entire court on offense, but he had a few big plays in the interior down the stretch and outside of one play right at the 25 point lead, wasn't part of any of the turnovers that led to their lead being so precarious. He was much better in the 2nd half offensively than Clarkson, who on top of having the worst defensive half I have ever seen a player play, also went 0-4 from the field for zero points and I believe a turnover. If you want to slander someone, slander Clarkson.)"
I mean they got Terance Mann now lol
Claxton about to go Terance Mann
"I also feel like people are completely overlooking the fact that Terance Mann had, literally, the best game of his NBA career. It was a complete anomaly.    You just gotta shake his hand if he's gonna do that."
Teraance Mann is who I expected terance Ferguson to be.. lol
The Hawks won 2 series and lost to LeBron. These scrubs lost to Nic Batum and Terance Mann
"I don't think making Terance Mann beat you is a terrible game plan. Him &amp; PBev went 10/14 from 3. How is any coach supposed to game plan for that?  The part where Quinn messed up is in the 4th quarter, when the game was close, he didn't make any adjustments. It's like he didn't want to accept what was happening."
"Most people seem to be blaming either Gobert, Snyder, or both. While I don't disagree that Snyder should have definitely made some adjustments, especially during the 4q, I think what Rudy is saying here is really important.  If you're Snyder, having a ""make Mann beat us"" game plan doesn't seem like a bad idea at all. If Mann doesn't have the best game of his life we're going to game 7 and there's not a peep about Snyder or Gobert. Unfortunately, Mann was having the best game of his life and Snyder failed to accept it, and make adjustments.  To be fair, when a guy like Mann is having a game like that, that becomes a very hard team to beat.  I don't think this experience makes him a bad coach, or Gobert an overrated defender. Terance Mann &amp; PBev went 10/14 from 3. If you're a jazz player/fan, that's just tough yo. Doesn't always have to be someone who fucked everything up."
Terance Mann is a career 40% 3 point shooter. Giving up wide open corner 3s all game to any average 3 point shooter is a recipe for disaster.
"People blaming Gobert have no idea who else is on the Jazz roster.  You want Favors in there to get smoked?  Or how about a smaller guy ... except none of the other Jazz options have the lateral quickness or defensive instincts to be more effective than Gobert, who's actually pretty damn mobile for a center.  Gobert is not at fault.  They have to give up something going against a 5 out offense from a team that was already insanely efficient from deep during the regular season.  No one thought Terance Mann would go supernova and it's never a guarantee that Pat Bev and Batum will be super clutch from deep."
"That was the Clippers entire strategy though--they put five shooters on the floor and basically asked the Jazz which one they wanted to leave uncovered.  You really can't stick to EVERYONE, at some point you're going to have to help off in situations. The Jazz decided they would help off Terance Mann, and well, we all saw what happened. Everyone on the Clips was making shots in the second half though, so I'm not sure it would've mattered if they decided to stick to Mann because someone else likely would've just made the same shots instead."
Did you guys forget to manntion Terance Mann?
"I'm an old head..... the days of Magic, Bird, Michael. But watching these playoffs, I'm certain the game is in good hands. The play of Morant, Luka, Trae, Terance Mann, Donovan and Devin Booker have all but solidified the league for years to come. Thank You."
"How exactly does Ty Lue have more flexibility than Quin Snyder without Kawhi and Ibaka? This is a revisionist take.  Playing Terance Mann was a risky move that paid off and now it’s being seen as “Ty Lue had a ton of depth.” Snyder wasnt even willing to remove Gobert off the floor, he clearly was risk averse."
Terance Mann is just named after James Earl Jones' character in Field of Dreams...
If they were talking about leaders they would be talking about Terance Mann not PG.
"Objectively I would say no or unlikely. But if this is just who Terance Mann is, then yes, it’s very likely. Either way, we will be seeing a lot of Bridges, Crowder, Johnson, and Craig minutes."
Terance Mann would like a word...
Jazz: You can’t beat us again! Kawhi is still injured.  Clippers: Oh yeah? Well we got Terance Mann.

"&gt;I’m just glad the man gets to prove that he’s a great coach after being the butt of LeCoach jokes for years   I mean.. Lue did get hired as the Head Coach out of nowhere solely because of LeBron. And LeBron was doing everything, as usual. He's a better coach than 99% of all the other actual coaches in the league. That's not really a surprise, or something new. So the ""memes"" are inevitable   &gt;  Jokes and Memes is an internet thing. Reddit,  Twitter and all other places.

Terance “Michael” Mann with the heat
Terance Mann played a wonderful game especially the 3rd quarter…. But Reggie Jackson was the star of today’s game….. every time that man had the ball he was so dangerous whether he was scoring or assisting…. He was the motor of the team he kept them going

"Terance Mann? ""Who the fook is that guy?"""
*Because Terance Mann got his ass there*
"""Why doesn't Terance Mann get more minutes?""   Saw this SO much throughout the year. Can't ignore the dude now."
Terance Mann went Super Saiyan confirmed
"I guess I have to agree with the other guy. Game 6 was a team of 6. Rondo and Zubac and Kennard were getting slight minutes just to give the big 6 a rest. So, those were the other choices, but Ty Lue preferred Terance Mann over people who quite recently had been starters."
"""Look at Terance Mann, so inspirational"""
"oh no, without Kawhi it might be trouble for us. Hope Terance Mann can step up"
Terance Mann 2021 Playoff series wins: 2  Michael Jordan 2021 Playoff series wins: 0  LeBron James 2021 Playoff series wins: 0  Proof that Mann is infinitely better than MJ and LeBron combined.
Wait who's Terance Mann and which alternate universe I'm in ? Do you guys know Michael Jordan ?
terance mann??? what.
You misspelled Terance Mann
So just like Terance Mann
"I think someone who deserves some praise tonight for Terance's progression is Lou Williams. Lou mentored Terance since his joined the Clippers as a rookie. Terance looked up to Lou, and when the news hit that Lou was traded, Terance posted a post about how much Lou meant to him. He referred to Lou as his Big Bro. And Lou has publicly stated that Terance was his young gun. He viewed him as his little bro. Lou William's was a BIG part of the Clipper locker room. He also help mentor Zubac on being more aggressive to the hoop and telling him to keep battling for rebounds.  So while this was a fantastic night for Mann, I think Lou Williams deserves some shine for mentoring and helping Mann's progression as a young player."
"it would have to be a total team effort behind his leadership like we saw in games 5 and 6 (not to take anything away from Terance Mann, he was the best Clipper tonight)"
2015 Hawks weren’t remotely as talented and no one thought they would win shit. Jazz got beat by Terance Mann for Christ sake.
"Your team got cooked by KD, the Jazz got whooped by f’ing Terance Mann ffs"
"On the positive side, I'd have to say Trae. If he goes to a conference finals before Luca wins a playoff series, that's a major jump from even this season when some were claiming the hawks were better without him.  Terance Mann! He didn't get 10 minutes in the two losses to Utah, and now you can count him for 25 mins and 12 pts with upside.  On the negative end, I'm looking at Rudy Gobert. I guess I could say Snyder, but one of those two needs to be blamed for why they can't switch to contain the 3 in those last two games. But Rudy goes from 3 time DPOY to hunted in a week?  Philly could still win and we'll forget it, but if they lose, it's almost certainly going to include a terrible Ben Simmons fourth quarter and a lot of talk about what to do."
Kawhi's USB drive was inserted rectally into Terance Mann
Terance Mann all about that jerk chicken
You forgot terance Mann 😤
Terance Mann looks like a random 2025 rookie SF in 2k.
Luke Kennard and Terance Mann are really the same age huh
I want the Suns to win but I'm gonna need Terance Mann to go off again
I thought Terance Mann was the second coming. What's going on?
Give 👏 Pat Bev's 👏 minutes 👏 to Terance Mann 👏
Terance Mann coming out party these playoffs
Terance Mann wow
I need Terance Mann to be so consistently good that the Clips are forced to create Mann Merch (other than $200 jerseys)
Tre Mann is coming in the draft this year for the Mann memes. Frees up Terance to go full Star Wars.
Manns not a shooter like Herro and wont command a starting spot next year likely. So he is un likely to go cold/regress as much as Herro did.  This message was brought to you by THE TERANCE MANN FAN CLUB.
Terance Mann is this playoffs' Tyler Herro.
"Kevin Huerter is not an MVP. I sucked dick for a Terance Mann rookie card. Have you ever sucked dick for Kevin Huerter? No, you haven't. Boo."
Terance Mann really saved the Clippers franchise. He really turned into Kawhi Leonard that game.
"Well, Giannis and Terance Mann"
This seems pretty legit though. Like what's wrong with Terance Mann getting a little tip for hating the Jazz so much?  Every team can get some kind of discretionary budget up to a certain amount that they can choose to hand out to players who exceeded expectations or something.
(a) He was a poor defender in the regular season pre injury  (b) Are you saying it's okay for Mitchell to give up easy drives every play because Gobert is on his team? Even though Gobert has to worry about simultaneously guarding Terance Mann in the corner? Lol?
Reminds me of game 6 Terance Mann!
"you’re right, but let’s not forget that reggie jackson and terance mann were getting buckets on him in the paint too lmao."
I think if one team figures out the other through adjustments it's the Suns. Clippers also have a few things they can fix but fatigue + already giving them the smallball looks and not having great success + no Kawhi makes their margin of error minute. Like I know he's been great for 9 games but Reggie Jackson was ridiculous last night.    Devin Booker was robbed of his all nba selection.   Terance Mann is dope and Pfizer P will be awesome to witness.   The chess match in the first half was compelling but the second half with the superstars going off and the Mikal showing in the fourth quarter was better.   I know that it's discounting the Clippers majorly and it will not go that way cause they're just that good at shooting but my feel has been Suns in 5 idk. I'd say 6 it's much more likely though.  Deandre Ayton can do some things better but he was great overall. Helped shut down PG when he stopped dropping on him in the 4th.
"Player development and trades. The Sixers FO were so focused on losing games, they forgot to develop their young players (you can't do both at the same time). The Sixers were looking for gold in the draft instead of finding guys like Terance Mann, Fred Vanvleet and Kevin Huerter to fill in the gaps in their team."
"Terance Mann rose to the occasion for his team, then you have Ben Simmons."
The Kevin Huerter and Terance Mann disrespect in this topic is palpable.
Terance mann
"Assuming we're only including players form the last 5 years (So no Curry, Klay, Draymond):  PG: Malcolm Brogdon (2016)  SG: Jordan Poole (2019) (Might be KPJ)  SF: Terance Mann (2019)  PF: Isaiah Stewart (2020)  C: Mitchell Robinson (2018)"
"I’m no Mavs fan but Luka’s help was pretty MIA in the last few games of the Clips series. Young has had good help from Collins, Capela, Huerter, and Gallinari. We’re not talking a fluke 39 point game from Terance Mann (who had 9 today). Trae shot 5/23 and was 1/14 in the first half. Without Huerter’s huge game they go home."
Kevin Huerter and Terance Mann putting away the top in their respected conferences.. who the fuck woulda known?
Kevin Huerter having his Terance Mann game
Nic Batum and Terance Mann have been huge for them this post-season
"It's just really bad r/nba takes that make you question whether or not these nephews are even watching the games, or if they're just seeing these highlights. So, basically, business as usual around here.  Gobert can't be called a liability at all. That's honestly a bizarre take. Gobert is having a big effect on what the Clippers can get at the rim. Half the time, the Clippers get to the rim, and decide they rather not challenge Gobert, and get the ball back out for another look. (This Terance Mann highlight is an exception). In direct contrast, the Clips are not doing that with Favors - they're continually attacking and getting high percentage shots at the rim with Favors over and over.  If anything, Jazz fans are actually asking Gobert to play more, beyond what a defensive big normally plays (asking for 40+ min out of him). And for good reason. In playoff basketball, you gotta try to take away something. Gobert takes away most things in the paint pretty well, even if his perimeter defense can be exploited. But Favors takes away nothing. So what's the next step? Have the Jazz go small-ball and completely abandon how their team is structured? There's no great answer, but Gobert is a good one, and definitely the best one that the Jazz have."
"No, they have to face Terance Mann"
"&gt;During last night’s event, The Playbook Vol. 4, team advisor Jerry West spoke on several things, including the team’s free agency acquisitions, the rookies taken in the draft and his outlook for the team. One of the most notable things he mentioned though, revolved around rookie point guard Terance Mann.  &gt;West said that he believes Mann will be playing a lot by the end of the season. Coming from The Logo himself, this is a big endorsement for Mann.  &gt;With the departure of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander in the Paul George deal, the Clippers looked like they would be lacking depth at the point guard position. They had taken Terance Mann in the second round prior to the trade, but no one knew what to expect from the Florida State prospect."
The hawks lost to LeBron. Utah lost to terance Mann
Stockton's curse invoked the ghosts of Game 6 Corey Brewer and Josh Smith to empower Terance Mann. The circle is now complete.
"Terance Mann, 1 R. That man deserves to have his name spelled right"
"Yeah, y'all have Fred VanVleet by committee: Reggie Jackson, Terance Mann, Nic Batum, and some Luke Kennard."
"F the clippers 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️. Both teams were injured, and Terance Mann decided to act up for no reason."
he literally got dunked on by terance mann lol
See Terance Mann game 6
Terance Mann is pretty good
Kawai created Terance Mann in a weapon-x science lab during the off season
Terance Mann is Kawhi’s smurf.
"Nobody *allows* Terance Mann to put up 20, Terance Mann *decides* to put up 20"
Terance Mann.
Terance Mann with the game of his career  So far
Terance Mann really didn't wanna go back to Utah
Who needs Kawhi when you have Terance fucking Mann? What a legendary performance.
Terance Mann.
Terance Mann: Hold my beer
Terance “The Man” Mann showed up
TERANCE MANN
"Yeah we should, except Reggie Jackson played out of his mind all series and Terance Mann just dropped 40. Jazz should have played better defense but when a whole team shoots like 80% for a long stretch it doesnt matter who they're missing."
GOGGLES JACKSON DONT FUCK AROUND. Also Terance Mann is pretty good
Look at Terance Mann
TERANCE IS THE FUCKING MANN AND THE FUTURE OF THIS FRANCHISE
"""We'd win too if we had Terance Mann on our team"""
"First, we had the annual Jeff Green game. Now we have the Terance Mann game. The NBA just keeps on giving."
"Yes, the clippers lineup with **checks notes** an old batum, morris, reggie jackson, terance mann, and paul george is revolutionizing small ball. Yes. The original lineup of death here. Nobody ever won 3 championships with this type of lineup. Or 73 games. New basketball here, folks."
FSU legend Terance Mann
Except Terance Mann isn't going to be a one hit wonder.   Book it now. Give Mann 30+ MPG next year and he'll average at least 15 pts 5 rebs and 3 assists.
This Quin Snyder press conference is rough. He looks like Terance Mann has given him PTSD.
Game 6 Terance Mann &gt; Game 6 Klay Thompson  change my mind
"Playoff hall of fame now includes Reggie “Glasses” Jackson and Terance “there goes that” Mann.   Gotta love this for Playoff P too, dudes always been one of my favs and sucked seeing him in the bubble last year and I’m so happy he bounced back and took this team to the WCF without Kawhi."
Holy fuck you violated him just like Terance Mann did
Terance Mann is a rich man's Kawhi
We have Reggie Jackson and Terance Mann tho!
"Injured forward Kawhi Leonard yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Terance Mann gave a look of pleasant surprise. Reggie Jackson yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Paul George hit the locker room door, former NBA great Ty Lue hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
Terance THE Mann
Not just 2-0 series lead. Lost 4 straight and Kawhi Leonard was out for two of them and they let Terance Mann almost score 40 on them.
"Not a Clippers fan, but it was amazing watching the come back. Terance Mann and Reggie Jackson playing some amazing basketball."
"I feel like Terance Mann would be on a ""who he play for"" segment, and someone would say like the magic"
"As a raps fan, we lost to a generational talent in 2018.. The Jazz blowing a 25 pt lead because of Terance Mann is just... sad lmaooo"
Terance Mann. That's it. That's the comment.
"They didn't just blow a big lead. They did so in a game where the Clippers were without Kawhi. They allowed Terance Mann to put up 20 in the 3rd, in a game where they were up 25 in the same quarter. In a week full of crazy comebacks and chokejobs, this one was next level awful from the Jazz."
terance mann really said look at me i’m kawhi now
Terance with the Next Mann Up mentality
Terance Mann got the Kawhi update
Terance Mann you freaking BEAST!!
Terance Mann will forever be a Clippers legend.
"When you blow a 25-point lead in the 2nd half, while allowing Terance Mann to put up 20 on you in the 3rd, in a game that is must-win for you? You deserve all the ""disrespect"" that ensues."
terance mann the real king of LA
Terance Mann is a god.
TERANCE MANN IS MY MVP
Fun fact: I saw Terance Mann at the draft in Brooklyn. Wished him good luck in the bathroom and now he’s goin off. He was sittin in the stands like everyone else.
Put some respect on the name of Terance Mann.
TERANCE MUHHHTHAFUCKING MANN
Everyone go look up Terance Mann on Wikipedia
Terance “Louis Armstrong” Mann!
Terance Mann greatest player in Clippers history?!
Damn as a jazz fan this hurts real bad. But they totall deserved to lose. Blowing a 26 point lead has no business in the wcf. Props to Terance Mann.
Terance Mann is making FSU proud. I’m not a clippers fan but Mann is from FSU so I’m happy my dude is having his best game of his career in his second season. 39 points for the kid.
"I mean to be fair, they were facing the superstar duo of Terance Mann and Reggie Jackson. Not much they could do."
"This might be a hot take, but is Terance Mann the best player in the world?"
Terance “The” Mann
Terance FUCKING Mann!
Steve Balmer just included Terance Mann in his will.
TERANCE MANN BECAME PRIME MJ FOR 1 GAME
Terance Motherfucking Mann!
"No Serge Ibaka and no Kawhi Leonard, down by 25, and then here come Paul George, Terance Mann, Pat Bev, Nicolas Kaboom, and Reggie the Big Government Jackson. After 51 playoffs that made Clip fans depressed, they deserve every bit of this conference finals appearance. And so does Mann and PLAYOFF P."

"Paul George is awesome. haha ""[Terance Mann] one of the best young players in the league, he reminds me a lot of myself"""
So who had Terance Mann being the leading scorer during a 25 point comeback against the 1 seed in an elimination game for a cursed franchise missing their superstar?
