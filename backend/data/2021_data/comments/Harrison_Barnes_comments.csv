Harrison Barnes
"Always listen to Wolves fans.  That said, I think Wiggins with us is different than when he was w/ them. He's being paid too much (and too much was expected of him by Minny, which is fair considering he was the #1 pick), but he's been fairly consistent for us and plays great defense. If we look at him as a Harrison Barnes replacement, I'm not upset at all.   But Oubre though... Teague has looked like ass for a while now, but idk WTF happened w/ Oubre. Seems like his play for the Suns was an aberration (and even then Suns fans kinda warned us), and he's reverting back to how he was on the Wiz."
Harrison Barnes
"that draft was BAD, there's legit no way Draymond makes it to 7.  He's at worst the 5th pick in retrospect and probably goes 4th.  AD, Lillard, Beal, Draymond &amp; Khris Middleton are the top 5 players.  After that it's Harrison Barnes, Jae Crowder, Drummond, Fournier, Terrence Ross &amp; Austin Rivers.  Oddly enough it seems likely that the Warriors would end up with Harrison Barnes all over again."
"Which free agent has dallas gotten that's been worthwhile?   Chandler parsons and harrison barnes? They're not going to land a big time free agent, they need to get a 1b or 1c type star. Think oldapido/gordon/lavine type.   KP is fine but his health is a big concern. Plus his shooting is off, how the hell can kevin durant come back and shoot well but this guy can't. Guy is a giraffe, like modify your shot to a reggie miller or something and get that shot off."
I guess I see that as more like a Tobias Harris or Harrison Barnes type more than another guy similar to Love. Prince is kind of like a poor man’s version of that. Durant or George kind of the rich man’s version.
"2 games in a row Fox has taken over in the 4th. All-Star.  Harrison Barnes is playing the best basketball i’ve seen him play, and he has been an absolute joy to watch this season.  Those techs on Bagley were softer than a butterfly landing with sore feet.   This team is so goddammed stressful to watch lol"
We're lucky he ain't a sun. It will be difficult watching Dennis Smith Junior and Harrison Barnes play.
"like Harrison Barnes, Wiggins showed early on in college he was never quite on their level"
"Haha you really think we want RJ, and we would give up Lavine to get him? He's good, but non-Knicks fans aren't that high on him. He isnt a great shooter and he plays on the worst offensive team in the league rn. He is basically Harrison Barnes or poor mans Derozan. He doesnt project to ever be an elite #1 option  I ageee that it doesnt make sense for yall to trade for lavine, nor does it make sense for bulls to give up lavine"
The reason curry forced the 3 is cause Harrison Barnes was not hitting anything and lebron was ready to block him again at the rim. Curry couldn’t drive and kick it out and he probably wasn’t going to get a layup over lebron. This all helped out love greatly. He did a good job getting a contest in but there was a lot going into that defensive stop besides Kevin love.
I don’t think the Raptors would trade him to us and he’s a little too inconsistent for my liking. I’d love to get Harrison Barnes
"giannis sucks, they needa trade him for a real player like harrison barnes, or buddy heild, or marvin bagley to name a few"
there is no way the Celtics are getting Bradley Beal or Harrison Barnes with the Hayward TPE or by trading Kemba's contract.  Keep dreaming r/bostonceltics
"Haliburton, DeRozan, Malik Beasley, RJ Barrett, Harrison Barnes, Daniel Theis"
"It’s a little scary how much the Kings rely on Harrison Barnes. He’s the only real wing in the rotation, and he’s playing 35 minutes per game while being the Kings’ best isolation scorer (maybe tied with Bagley) and guarding the opponent’s best wing player. He has been almost comically consistent since joining the Kings, so I’m confident he can keep it up, but there’s no way this team could sustain a Barnes injury and win anything at all."

"That’s his only actual basketball skill, being tall.  He has negative basketball IQ, zero off the dribble moves, no ability to pass, and zero lateral quickness so he can’t do more than hang in the paint on D.  He’s essentially 7’3 Harrison Barnes on offense, and slightly more mobile Boban on defense as he is right now.  He looks great when he doesn’t have to think about anything, but ask him to make decisions and he’s a disaster, defenses are exposing him by doing just that, knowing he’s a tire fire once his first move is taken away"
Harrison Barnes imo
Harrison Barnes or Coby White for UNC.
Harrison Barnes
"Terrence Ross, maybe Aaron Gordon, Larry Nance, Harrison Barnes...  Hard to know who will be available the moment as most teams are playing hard to win."
Free Harrison Barnes.
I was thinking of Harrison Barnes. A reunion would be cool to see
"Celtics fans are collectively losing their shit over the prospect of trading for Harrison Barnes.    I personally am pretty intrigued by Terrence Ross, Thad Young, Harrison Barnes, Garrett Temple, and Otto Porter Jr."
"Honestly I was jaded but fingers crossed when they traded for Wiggins. 'He's Harrison Barnes, but a little better' was basically my opinion when the news dropped. So far, he's been about halfway between Kawhi when he first entered the league and basically just played defense and shot spot up shots and current Kawhi who's basically doing a LeBron impression. Very solid effort, and pretty effective on defense, pretty consistent shooting, and surprisingly good play-making and isolation scoring.  I forget where I saw it, but he's shooting like 38-39% on spot-up 3's, and 50-52% (fuzzy memory) on pull up 3's, which I would assume are probably going to flip and he'll probably end the year at like 40-41% on spot-ups and 35% on pull-ups, but who knows, maybe he's just better at pull up 3's than Steph Curry now 😅"
Can the new GM get rid of Harrison Barnes please?
Harrison Barnes was better than Wiggins
He is the mean average of Harrison Barnes and Kd.
"&gt; Warriors had 2 damn good defenders in Klay and Draymond, and Steph wasn’t a slouch either.  Warriors also had Andre Iguodala, Marreese Speights, Shaun Livingston, Andrew Bogut, David Lee, Harrison Barnes etc.  Depth matters. One of the reasons Warriors fans are optimistic about next season, when Klay comes back, is that while having two seasons effectively lost to injuries sucks absolute balls, the bright side is that it let us rebuild the bench. Bench depth is incredibly hard to maintain during non-stop title runs."
Harrison Barnes is actually one of the few steadying forces in the chaos that is the Kings roster. But it isn't enough to overcome Walton's schemes.
"Harrison Barnes is the most underrated player in the NBA. Never gets talked about but when you watch him play he's really good, and never makes a bad play. HB is slept on"
I wish I loved anything the way Harrison Barnes loves to post up on guards.
yeah i can't wait for Harrison Barnes' MVP season either
"&gt;   U either wanna move him rn or wanna bet on him  Moving him is hard. Anyone worth getting back for Wiseman is probably making more money, so it's hard to make salaries work, given the other max guys. You could get draft picks, or perhaps other young talent that's not ready yet.  They won in '15 with a young, green Harrison Barnes in the starting lineup. They have plenty of time to let Wiseman develop. I can't imagine they have any interest in moving him."
Imagine thinking teams would rather pay Harrison Barnes more than a current All-Star with a championship pedigree over the next 2 years
"""FUCK YOU YOU TRASH ASS TEAMMATE I'D RATHER HAVE HARRISON BARNES BACK YOU FUCKING SCRUB""     \-Draymond the next time"
Harrison Barnes. Was a great 3rd/4th option on a championship Warriors pre-KD (and their 73-9 team) and then put up 20 ppg on a bad Mavs team
"LOL.   Wtf is ""Prime Harrison Barnes"". I would bet on only Lebron at best winning a ring with that team. And definitely not Harden/KD.   KD + the warriors didn't do extraordinarily well tbh. KD still scored like a monster but he doesn't make the team much better."
"Barnes, Harrison. Westbrook, Russel. Russell, D'Angelo."
"All Steph, Klay, and Dray need is a Harrison Barnes that won't choke."
"We would have taken Wendell Carter JR, which would've given us a superstar lineup of Dennis Smith Jr, Wesley Matthews, Dorian Finney Smith, Harrison Barnes, and WCJ. I'm sure we would've gotten at least 8 wins that year :)"
"Look at the team's he was on and the role he had, it's completely different for him in golden state. They just need him to play like a better Harrison Barnes, not a max player"
"We just need him to be like Harrison Barnes -- not a star, but a consistent defender and opportunistic scorer.    I feel like offensively he's been getting better every game, not necessarily in terms of output, but he's not foolishly driving into crowded paint or making as many bad decisions."
Harrison Barnes is also overpaid
"&gt; Wiggins is overpaid  No he's not. Harrison Barnes makes 4m less per year, and Wiggins is becoming a fringe all-star 2 way wing."
Wonder if Harrison Barnes would be someone the Celtics would be interested in. He’d fit into their trade exception and I don’t think they’d have to give up too much for him.
We need another wing player not a big - basically nobody in the league can guard Embiid/Giannis/AD.   Someone like Harrison Barnes or maybe Aaron Gordon or something.
Kuminga for sure.  A more aggressive Harrison Barnes.
"The thread is literally about him IMPROVING and not about him being an all nba level player but i guess some people have difficult reading so its alright.  Ya got me mate, hes literally Harrison Barnes 2.0 sick burn."
End of season? I’m saying what you said right now is dumb lol. And Wiggins having “highest TS ever” when he used to play in Minny and couldn’t even make the playoffs means nothing to me.  I’m only gonna guess the number is probably just above 50 lol. Harrison Barnes 2.0
"Kyle Korver went to Pella High School and was a high profile player in the state. His parents met playing for Central College in Pella and a lot of his extended family plays and coaches around the state. McDermott grew up mostly in Iowa and won state at Ames High with teammate Harrison Barnes, his dad was a coach at Northern Iowa and then Iowa State. Doug was committed to UNI before his dad went to Creighton."
"Yeah I called him a huge upgrade over Harrison Barnes, in comparison to our squad in Kerr's first two seasons. A couple people seriously tried to argue that Barnes was better than Wiggins."
"&gt; his selfless nature and ability to create high-percentage looks for far-poorer talents.  Prime Harrison Barnes, Iggy, Draymond, Klay fucking Thompson and even Bogut are not far-poorer talents.  As amazing as Steph is, he is not the right guy to use as an example of individual contribution to team success. It can easily be argued that any of the current great players could have won a chip even with the pre-KD Warriors team."
Harrison barnes was the greatest scourge on our franchise since we traded Robert Parish and Kevin Mchale to boston for $14 and a cranberry-tuna sandwich from Togo's
"We were due for a good one after Jordan Poole, Pat McCaw, Festus Ezeli, Jacob Evans, Damian Jones, and Nemanja Nedovic. Granted those were all late 1st rounders and we hadn't had a lotto pick since Harrison Barnes, but not a great track record considering some of the gems we missed out on. Paschall was the only hit since the Draymond Green pick"
Yeah he was athletic but he picked his spots. Harrison Barnes was too but he just had low energy all the time.
Replace Harrison Barnes with anyone that shoots decently and the warriors win. Barnes missed an astronomical number of shots that postseason. He shot soooooooo poorly
Have you watched him play? Harrison Barnes type? lol
"If Captain Kirk would have called it quits a couple years early, he would be very close statistically to Harrison Barnes."
He already eclipsed harrison barnes by being an allstar and MIP last year.   Not every wing player who isn't a franchise guy is a harrison barnes type... That's just an extremely lazy comparison
"Interesting bit of coincidence...  I went to the same HS as South Dakota's Mike Miller, albeit a couple decades prior.  His dad was my Jr. high vice principal.  I live in Ames, IA now and remember when Harrison Barnes (Iowa) and Doug McDermott (North Dakota) were in the same class together at Ames High.  That freaking team was stacked between those two and I think two or three others from that era who went on to play D1."
"I feel zion can stick, his game feels more franchise stickiness to me. Ingram is in a danger zone of becoming a harrison barnes type that is in perpetual ping-pong and never finds his feet.  Next few years are a big danger for his potential ceiling."
"From Des Moines, and my high school team squeaked into the tournament, only to get dunked on for a while by Harrison Barnes. It was sick."
"Harrison Barnes was so popular here in Iowa. I remember his ""got milk?"" poster was all over our schools. He dominated high school"
Kerr already moved Paschall back to the bench because Paschall does better with the ball in his hands more and does not get nearly as many touches with Curry and Draymond on the floor. It's sort of the reason Iguodala and Harrison Barnes were swapped back in the day. HB was more confident getting his legs moving early in the game and with less touches while Iguodala could still play solid off the bench regardless.
Garrett Temple  Rodney Hood  Kyle Anderson  Semi Ojeleye  Harrison Barnes
Is it weird he reminds me of a less-streaky Harrison Barnes?
"If Harrison Barnes could make a shot, he'd have one less.. If Ray Allen missed, he'd have one less"
Max contract Harrison Barnes would like a word!
He doesn’t even have a bad contract - $22m per year increasing to a $28m PO is insanely reasonable in today’s NBA.   He basically makes what guys like Harrison Barnes and Buddy Hield make.   It’s not like he’s making $40m or something crazy.
"Yep, ppl just like to be contrarian and argue about obvious things. The most hilarious example was when the KD to GSW rumors first popped up in the middle of the 2016 season and ppl were like ""they're 45-4, why mess with things. I'd rather keep Harrison Barnes and a few bums off the bench"" and than we saw how that turned out"
and they didn’t have harrison barnes for 16 games that season
"Perhaps being closer to home could help KPJ?  Either way, it would get the Kings out of the bad Harrison Barnes contract and give them a potential piece if they can work it out with him."
Drummond &amp; Kevin Porter Jr. for Bagley &amp; Harrison Barnes
Harrison Barnes and Richaun Holmes
This Harrison Barnes brick was *rough*. https://go.nba.com/swc0
"You posted all these and didn't include the OG, harrison barnes?"
Harrison Barnes’ cousin.
"They did not need a hall of famer to get by Lebron. They just needed an upgrade over Harrison Barnes' can't-shoot-3s-in-the-clutch bum ass.   If getting over Lebron required an upgrade of 20 points, KD was an upgrade of 50 points. It was overkill."
I want Harrison Barnes back
"He’s Harrison Barnes, he’s always been Harrison Barnes"
"the big names I've seen on the Celtics sub are Harrison Barnes, Aaron Gordon, Terrence Ross, PJ Tucker, and most recently Oladipo (even tho dipo is more of a ball handler than a wing)"
That's doing a disservice to NBA Finals Harrison Barnes.
Kelly Oubre is NBA Finals Harrison Barnes but the regular season version
Warriors drafted Harrison Barnes and Festus Ezeli with their first two first round picks and Dray with their 2nd.   OP trying to say by drafting Dray with the third of their picks is a bad choice for what reason I'm not sure
"hes done a lot of bad things, there is a copypasta list out there that keeps getting added to, this is wha ti found on a 10 second google search for that pasta  Staged a coup of John Stockton while he was on the Jazz, causing Stockton to retire.  Cheated on his wife with a stripper, then getting blackmailed by the prostitute + some other guy, while at the same time being a born-again pastor  Bristled at Mike Malone being the assistant coach under him (ownership wanted him to be the Associate Head Coach, like Gentry was with Kerr, but when Jackson found out he said NO WAY  Didn't let assistant coaches do interviews with press because he thought they were gunning for his job  Pushed Malone out because Jackson thought Malone was gunning for his job  Ran ISO-ball all the time  Instilled a ""us vs them"" where the ""them"" was the entire front office. He would tell the players that the front office didn't want them to win so that Mark Jackson would look bad. C'mon that's lunacy  Barred Jerry West and Jim Barnett (the beloved TV color guy) along with everyone else from practices so they couldn't hear the crazy shit he said to the team  Told the team Ezeli was rooting for them to lose so that Ezeli would look better (he was injured). This culminated in Ezeli in tears saying that there was no way he would do this, when confronted by the team  Told the team that Harrison Barnes was possessed by a demon, which is why he regressed  Darren Erman, the assistant responsible for the defense after Mike Malone left, was recording Mark Jackson surreptitiously to try and capture the crazy shit like the Harrison Barnes demon thing and the Ezeli thing, but was caught and fired  Noted homophobe, including the ""I'll pray for him"" when discussing Jason Collins coming out. This doesn't fly in the bay area when a lot of the team staff is gay and so is the front office, including the COO/President Rick Welts  Didn't want to hire actual good assistants, instead, he hired yes-men like Pete Myers and Lindsay Hunter, who backstabbed Alvin Gentry in Phoenix to get the head job  All the coaching staff were allying themselves with star players instead of the players who actually needed their help/development, so a lot players like Barnes didn't get the development time and help they needed  He put players against each other, telling a star player ""hey that bench thinks he's better than you"" and then telling the bench guy ""hey that star guy thinks you're shit, go take his job""  Didn't get along with anyone in the front office, including Jerry West, Bob Myers, and actually the rest of the employees (marketing, PR, etc) No preparation. He said in the Clippers series that he didn't need to prepare extra hours, when Doc Rivers was up all night devising schemes"
"KD was all in during his first season. There’d been some minor issues figuring out the proper balance of Steph and KD and those kind of magically resolved themselves when KD got hurt in the spring. The Warriors went something like 16-5 without KD and at one point ran off a 14 game win streak with Pat McCaw and then Matt Barnes at the 3. When KD came back, he just fit in seamlessly and basically played like Harrison Barnes on roids until we needed an easy bucket at which point he’d ISO or get a pick and roll up top.  But that only lasted one season. Draymond said in his appearance on All the Smoke that KD was upset when he didn’t get crowned the best player in the game after getting FMVP and he got it into his head the next season that Steph and Klay were intentionally freezing him out. Kerr and Iguodala, according to Dray, would go out of their way to run plays for KD so he wouldn’t get upset. This all culminated in ISO KD almost costing us the 2018 Houston series. It almost cost us the 2019 Houston series too. There is no argument to be made that the Warriors were a better or more talented team without KD, but against Houston in 2019, the Warriors offense hummed without Durant because we could run PNR with Steph and Dray in crunch time without having to give the ball to KD for mid post ISO’s."
"Fair enough. My point is really this - they both played mostly SF. Harrison got some run and plays called for him, Dray didn't. Mark Jackson used them as essentially interchangeable players with a clear preference for Barnes. Without injury, Draymond doesn't get much run at all with Mark as the coach."
He's an expiring deal. They could probably trade him for a bad/long contract and get picks back?   Harrison Barnes + a pick?
"[Here's an article that mentions how much Harrison played at PF previously and projecting less minutes at PF this year](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1752865-spotlighting-and-breaking-down-golden-state-warriors-power-forward-position)  [More talk of Barnes playing PF.](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1935213-is-harrison-barnes-holding-back-the-golden-state-warriors)  I'm basing this off of my memory. Basketball Reference just provides good backup proof. There's not a lot of other great evidence about Draymond, because he wasn't really used much outside of as a defensive stopper until the late regular season/late in the playoffs (due to injury)."
"There is nothing wrong with that but hope he doesn't expect to paid like a superstar if he is just an upgraded Draymond. Same with Tobi, who is an upgraded Harrison Barnes; should be only get $25m per year instead of the $35 to $40m."
"Celtics aren’t gonna make a move until the deadline. We need to see what Kemba looks like and if Romeo Langford can contribute. If we did though, most of our sub wants Harrison Barnes"
Harrison Barnes is slowly turning into that with all the small line ups Luke is putting together.
&gt; Steph-KD-Klay  This is such a different situation. KD basically came into the Warriors system and replaced Harrison Barnes. The Nets are still figuring out what their identity as a team is (like the Warriors are now). Also Steph and Klay are so much more unselfish players compared to Kyrie and Harden - they love playing offball and will always look to create for teammates and look for the best shot.
"Well the Celtics' biggest weakness is wing depth, but normally people have been thinking Harrison Barnes or Aaron Gordon with the TPE.  Not really thrilled by the idea of Oladipo since that seems like a rental and I doubt he'll be happy there."
"Super teams are one thing, and without the context of the Warriors they'd be the worst thing to happen to the league.   But what the Warriors had was something different. They had an all time GREAT team to begin with, and then just swapped Harrison Barnes for KD. It was beyond ridiculous. It was a once in a lifetime type of situation where the cap exploded and the Warriors had been able to sign their absolute super star on the cheap because of injury concerns that surprisingly just got better, so they had a 73 win team and enough space to sign a max player.  Ridiculous. Anyone who legitimately compares that team to a normal super team is fucking dumb."
"Lmao. This is not the same thing as KD to Warriors.  Our established core was still there: Steph, Klay, Draymond, Iguodala.  We made sacrifices to depth and our center position. We still had a strong defensive identity with our core and KD was slotted in as super saiyan version of Harrison Barnes.   The Nets are struggling in this early part of the season. Adding in Harden to the mix won't automatically fix things. Removing Allen is probably going to cause more problems in the short term."
If Kevin wins with Harden then I would consider it an impressive accomplishment and no asterisk.  The reason I'm not real impressed with his GS chips are because the team had won 2/3 years before he joined and the year they didn't win it they were super close. He joined a record setting team in the league that had already been winning and just swapped spots with Harrison Barnes (and he had been up 3-2 in the conference finals against them before he joined them which makes the move even weaker imo).
Leandro Barbosa Harrison Barnes Andrew Bogut Festus Ezeli  That 73 win team was 10 deep.
"Yup. Ironically, Harrison Barnes saved our asses that one time."
"They don't need to be as good as Harrison Barnes, although I have a hard time imagining doing worse with 20 million in extra cap, two 1st's, and a prospect. I'm also not suggesting they max anyone, just that they'd open up that type of cap space. If you spend reasonably and come away with new pieces that are worth relatively close to what they're paid, as Barnes is, you're way ahead from adding picks. The assets and flexibility offer more upside than Barnes ever will, which they need, because they're not going anywhere with him."
"I mean, I don't know that that collection of stuff ever amounts to any players who are as good as Harrison Barnes. Anybody they could get on a max would be an overpay this summer, too. But overall, I do agree that it's the sort of move that makes a lot of sense, as long as they get some future assets back."
because theres a better chance an all star/close to all star level player asks out in the offseason rather than in-season. harrison barnes isnt gonna push us over the top
"&gt; he is a negative asset.  Wiggins has been a top 5 two-way wing this season.  &gt; just wayyyy too expensive for his production.  He makes 8m more than Buddy Hield and 4m more than Harrison Barnes, neither of whom can hold down a starting role on a team 7 games under .500  Can we stop with this 'negative asset' garbage?"
"Harrison Barnes, Kevin Love, De’Aaron Fox, CJ McCollum, Myles Turner, Mason Plumlee, Marshall Plumlee, Miles Plumlee, Buddy Hield, DJ Augustin, Trevor Ariza, Julius Randle"
I don't disagree but you have to consider what it would cost to replace him. We lost Harrison Barnes to get KD and Barnes got a Max deal. Is he much better than Wiggins? I don't think so. You can get similar talent at a lower price but that usually means they're a much older player. Wiggins is still young and I don't see anyone in this league that would fit better and is cheaper. He's overpaid but he's ours and he fits. I don't think we can haggle and discount shop at this point.
"&gt;but I think they traded for him with the intent on him being new Harrison Barnes.  My comment is in response to the idea of trading Oubre so we can put Dipo and Wiggins together  Wiggins is ok, like you said. But Oubre is a better ""Harrison Barnes"" than wiggins, and actually scores within the offense. Oubre cuts hard and scores from off-ball activity,  I have no faith that wiggins efficiency will rise when klay comes back, because he doesnt score within the offense the way oubre does. He isos a lot and shoots long twos. There's some value to that when Steph goes to the bench, but I dont understand why you would Dipo AND Wiggins doing it, opposed to keeping Oubre and deciding between Dipo and Wiggs"
"&gt; Wiggins is one of the worst players to get this many chances to be a major offensive player on a team  I don't disagree with any of your comment, but I think they traded for him with the intent on him being new Harrison Barnes."
Harrison Barnes had a layup as one of his dunks that year
"It came within one draft selection of possibly happening.  Dame was the #6 overall pick of the 2012 NBA draft, and the warriors selected Harrison Barnes with the very next pick."
"Harrison Barnes but I don't see why the Kings do that.  Maybe Aaron Gordon, but his injuries are concerning.    Lonzo Ball maybe  and get back another pick from Pelicans."
Harrison Barnes to the Celtics for Aaron Nesmith + a late 1st
Can't be as bad as 2016 Finals Harrison Barnes
"I don't think the nuggets would do that personally. I think MPJ's ceiling is too high.  As for Harrison Barnes I think he could do a really good job on a winning team.  I think the raptors could push for a deal for him and Hassan Whiteside, maybe giving up Norman Powell Aaron Baynes Patrick McCaw and some picks? This would give the Raptors Center depth and scoring while the King's get draft assets and some expiring deals."
"Collins is a toughy. Is he a 4 or a 5, due to a bag in the offseason.  Maybe a straight swap Collins for MPJ? Kinda like it for both.  Harrison Barnes"
I would also like some Harrison Barnes
"Literally took Steph recovering from an MCL sprain, Harrison Barnes playing like trash, Draymond getting suspended and Lebron and Kyrie having all-time Finals’ performances for the Cavs to win by 4, in game 7, on the road. People talk about if the Cavs were at full strength in 2015, the Warriors weren’t at full strength in 2016 either."
Harrison Barnes bout to regress to his maverick form  if anyone trades for him
I would like some Harrison Barnes
"I just can't see us landing either Grant or Vucevic. Both are obviously a damn good players, but the price tags would be more than I think Ainge would like. To me Harrison Barnes is a more realistic option with the Kings looking more and more like they're gonna be selling at the deadline."
"I mean we may want Grant but I can't see us getting him. Harrison Barnes I think is a much more realistic trade option. Nesmith and our 1st for Barnes is something that I'd personally do, and I would imagine the Kings agree since Nesmith fits their timeline better."
Where was this Harrison Barnes in the 2016 NBA finals ? If he had played with this demeanor back then he would still be in a warriors uniform.
"Steph, Klay, and Harrison Barnes all played horribly, and they only lost by 4 in the game 7. They could have won by any one of those 3 playing slightly less horrible. Steph didnt have to go off for them to win"
"Same with MPJ, who granted got injured, but the difference between his money ($2.9 million first year salary) and Ayton ($8.1 million) is absolutely huge.   Harrison Barnes was also seen as a top pick coming out of HS, and was number 9"
We actually didn’t extent Jarrett when we had the chance too and Prince was signed the same year we got KD/Kyrie. He was always going to a moveable contract. What did the warriors really lose in the process of getting KD? Who Harrison Barnes? He’s one of the reasons you lost in 2016 with his inconsistent shooting
"Actually your correct, but I meant trading half their roster for him. They essentially got KD and only Barnes and Bogut were moved in the process of that. Nets literally moved most of their assets and picks for Harden solely. How people viewed it was KD just replaces Harrison Barnes.   If Nets win 73 games then Harden, then I doubt his name would be in the conversation for that. Nets are sort of strapped in not having many assets left so we paid the price for Harden. Warriors didn’t for KD and still kept Steph/Klay/Dray in the process."
"And their other significant bench player, Shaun Livingstone was 6’7 with go go gadget arms as well, so he wasn’t a bad dropoff defensively either. With the exception of Curry, I think the rest of the players in the death lineup were all 6’6-6’7 with long arms and could play defense relatively well, so it didn’t really matter if they got switched. Swap out Harrison Barnes for the slim reaper and it’s even more devastating.  Again, not counting Curry, I think Draymond might even have been the shortest player in those lineups, which makes it even more impressive what he was doing."
But you’re okay with paying Harrison Barnes $22 mil to play 20 minutes off the bench?
"That was a wild last minute but it shouldn't have taken that long lol, Harrison Barnes' stepback was filthy, if hields outback counted that would have been sick"
"That was a wild last minute but it shouldn't have taken that long lol, Harrison Barnes' stepback was filthy, if hields outback counted that would have been sick"
Fun fact. Harrison Barnes is top 30 this year in the 538 RAPTOR stat and the best player on the Kings
Is Harrison Barnes the greatest player of all time?
"I understand being upset, but there's being critical, and then there is posting ""why do you hate Kristaps Porziņģis?"" polls and wishing ill will towards him.   Folks are looking for any reason to be mad at him. There was a post recently talking about how he didn't celebrate enough after Luka's 3 pointer and how it meant he wanted to leave the team...  Harrison Barnes, Chandler Parsons and Erick Dampier all signed max or near max contracts and played way way worse, but get a fraction of the hate KP gets. It just goes to show me that the hate is not so much rooted in Porziņģis' actual play but rather the idea that it's hurting Luka."
"It's ridiculous... fans willing to give up on Porziņģis after 1.25 seasons is insane.   Also any team with Luka will not be tanking for a top 5 pick. They will be a 30 win team still and get a 8-10 pick. Would Luka, Brunson and a top 10 pick even be good? Chances are we draft another Dennis Smith Jr player.   Also if we get rid of Porziņģis who are we signing in free agency? Dallas' biggest free agent signings in 20 years have been Chandler Parsons, a AARP Vince Carter, 12 ppg Shawn Marion, Erick Dampier, Monta Ellis, DeAndre Jordan (2nd attempt), Wes Matthews post ACL, and Harrison Barnes to a max contract. Porziņģis has been better than all of those guys but gets more hate than all of them... And KP has hardly been the first player making max money. Parsons and Barnes both got max contracts and played worse than Porziņģis has. Dampier was our highest paid player during Dirk's prime and was a bench player."
"Less of a maple mamba more of a Canadian Harrison Barnes. Not a bad thing, just a solid all around player who is still extremely young."
"J.J. Redick is the only guy I'm sure is leaving. Zo, idk.   &gt;*Zion needs vets IMO. You can't just can't surround him with rooks. He deserves to compete.*  I'm with you 100%!!!! We really need a Harrison Barnes/Marcus Smart guy who just helps their younger teammates get into position on the court. A lot of our mistakes are just young guy mistakes."

"Mark Jackson stories copy pasted from another thread:   Staged a coup of John Stockton while he was on the Jazz, causing Stockton to retire.  Cheated on his wife with a stripper, then getting blackmailed by the prostitute + some other guy, while at the same time being a born-again pastor  Bristled at Mike Malone being the assistant coach under him (ownership wanted him to be the Associate Head Coach, like Gentry was with Kerr, but when Jackson found out he said NO WAY  Didn't let assistant coaches do interviews with press because he thought they were gunning for his job  Pushed Malone out because Jackson thought Malone was gunning for his job  Ran ISO-ball all the time  Instilled a ""us vs them"" where the ""them"" was the entire front office. He would tell the players that the front office didn't want them to win so that Mark Jackson would look bad. C'mon that's lunacy Barred Jerry West and Jim Barnett (the beloved TV color guy) along with everyone else from practices so they couldn't hear the crazy shit he said to the team  Told the team Ezeli was rooting for them to lose so that Ezeli would look better (he was injured). This culminated in Ezeli in tears saying that there was no way he would do this, when confronted by the team  Told the team that Harrison Barnes was possessed by a demon, which is why he regressed  Darren Erman, the assistant responsible for the defense after Mike Malone left, was recording Mark Jackson surreptitiously to try and capture the crazy shit like the Harrison Barnes demon thing and the Ezeli thing, but was caught and fired  Noted homophobe, including the ""I'll pray for him"" when discussing Jason Collins coming out. This doesn't fly in the bay area when a lot of the team staff is gay and so is the front office, including the COO/President Rick Welts Didn't want to hire actual good assistants, instead, he hired yes-men like Pete Myers and Lindsay Hunter, who backstabbed Alvin Gentry in Phoenix to get the head job  All the coaching staff were allying themselves with star players instead of the players who actually needed their help/development, so a lot players like Barnes didn't get the development time and help they needed  He put players against each other, telling a star player ""hey that bench thinks he's better than you"" and then telling the bench guy ""hey that star guy thinks you're shit, go take his job""  Didn't get along with anyone in the front office, including Jerry West, Bob Myers, and actually the rest of the employees (marketing, PR, etc) No preparation.  He said in the Clippers series that he didn't need to prepare extra hours, when Doc Rivers was up all night devising schemes"
Just like he was obsessed with Kemba Walker.  We traded Harrison Barnes for cap space. We used that cap space to resign players.
"For the uninitiated, the Kings roster. (Positions could be debated)  PG: De'Aaron Fox | Tyrese Haliburton | Jahmi'us Ramsey  SG: Buddy Hield | Cory Joseph | Kyle Guy | Justin James  SF: Harrison Barnes | DaQuan Jeffries  PF: Marvin Bagley III | Jabari Parker | Nemanja Bjelica  C: Richaun Holmes | Hassan Whiteside (Out) | Norvel Pelle  Whiteside's out for Health and Safety Protocols. Luke Walton's not a good coach, but how the heck is he supposed to win games with that roster? Fox is good, Hield will get his, Barnes is solid, and Bagley/Holmes are not terrible but they're below-average starters. Somehow though, their bench is even more dire. How many of these guys would even start on a good team? I think it's a bit extreme, but only Fox and Hield/Barnes could start for certain teams. I don't think anyone past Bagley/Holmes/Haliburton would crack a rotation, and some of those (like Bagley) would even be questionable."
"I hate saying things like this because they’re so annoying to hear but I would’ve tried to package the picks and make a play at a guys like Myles Turner, DeMar Derozan, Steven Adams, Bogdan Bogdonvic, Jrue Holiday, Harrison Barnes. Or if I was really confident in my draft skills I wouldve made more of an effort to move up in the draft in either 2019 or 2020"
"Tyrese Maxi Kleber would be 25 years old, and 6'6. He'd have great handles and shot creation and very solid defense and athleticism. I'd say he'd be a great above average role player wing. Still some untapped potential. I'd say he'd be like...Harrison Barnes maybe? Solid shitpost"
"The year Myers became GM, the team drafted Draymond Green, Festus Ezeli and Harrison Barnes. They had the 28-30th pick of the first round for five straight years and still ended up with two playoff level rotation players in Eric Paschall and Kevon Looney. The jury is still out on Poole, he's currently the G Leagues top scorer while taking time in the bubble. Smiley is trash and nobody can convince me otherwise.  Compared to someone like the Raptors, our GMs aren't great, but compared to teams like the Hornets or the Pistons, the Warriors FO is incredible."
"To be fair that's what a lot of people (including me) thought in this past draft. The Warriors FO doesn't often get the chance to draft a top fifteen pick, and they really crave it. The last top 15 picks they used since 2009 netted them James Wiseman, Harrison Barnes, Klay Thompson, Epke Udoh (hard miss), and Stephen Curry. They haven't missed much in the last eleven years when given a good chance."
Harrison barnes
"Romeo Langford, a first and second for Harrison Barnes"
"I say three way deal....  Sacramento gets-Kyle Kuzma, KCP, Kelly Olynyk and second rounders   Lakers get-Buddy Hield, Goran Dragic &amp; Hassan Whiteside   Miami gets-Harrison Barnes, Marc Gasol &amp; Talen Horton Tucker     Sacramento gets Kyle Kuzma and sheds Barnes salary. KCP and Okynyk give them veteran bench pieces.   Lakers improve their backcourt and get a good rim protector.   Heat gets Barnes as a stretch 4, Gasol becomes a sold backup to Bam and Tucker becomes a young piece and can learn from Iggy."
Harrison Barnes is 28. I thought he was like 31-32
"&gt;Kyrie/Gordon/Al walked without getting anything in return which set us back  I'm looking at the TPE and wondering who's out there that Boston can realistically get for low picks?  I'm pretty sure anyone near the full amount is out.  So probably some combination of it.  Looking at the OKC buffet menu though, the idea of taking Al back is funny, but more realistically George Hill?   Maybe Ariza, but I haven't watched him to see if he's still got it or is just old now.  Looking around there just aren't many teams far out of the playoffs to be definite sellers that also have decent vets the C's want to pick up (Harrison Barnes if the Kings slide further?)."
"He was 8-19 with 3 assists. He's shooting 37% from the floor this year and is having his worst year with assists by far. Look. I have been saying from the start that I think he will find his level, but it just is not happening right now. There is nothing we can do but just wait and hope. There is a possibility he could be traded in the off-season, bit nobody is going to take him right now.   Also, you seem to be missing the point: the TEAM defense is bad. The TEAM ball movement is bad. This squad is not a JJ Redick away from being a contender, or a Harrison Barnes, or a Porzingis. There is too much going wrong right now to warrant adding to the roster, AND we don't even have the assets to make a good trade anyways This team is a .500 team, and they're going to be that no matter what this year. Blow it up in the off-season."
"This team is not worth investing in. There is no trade available at the deadline that puts us in the same tier as Philly/Milwaukee/Brooklyn. JJ Redick? Harrison Barnes? Porzingis? None of them, even in the impossible scenario that we have the assets to make the trade, do not put us into the conversation of actually winning the East this year.  Our bench is garbage. Tatum and Brown are all stars but haven't figured out that thing where they make the TEAM better yet (only the Knicks and Wolves average fewer APG than the Celtics), Kemba is crawling around in the dark trying to find his shot again, and r/bostonceltics thinks Marcus Smart and Romeo Langford (who is a ghost) are going to fix what's going on right now. It's a mess. I'd much rather wait and use the massive TPE to blow this roster up in the off season than invest in this team."
"We should absolutely stop being a buyer, we need way more than a Harrison Barnes. Should go the other way: sell what we can, keep up the extended auditions for young players."
"Lakers only had 2. Toronto had 1 good one plus a lot of ok ones. What you need for a title changes with the quality of the rest of the league. Really there’s only one true big 3 in the league (Brooklyn) and they also have worse depth than us.   Kemba’s been playing well as of late sans the Pels game. He’s been getting much better and looks good physically. If he’s not playing like he was last season then it doesn’t matter who we get, we’re not contenders anyways.  I get that rotations shorten in the playoffs but we still need at least one other wing (preferably 2). Going 2 big so often in the playoffs is risky, but even if we do we still gotta have a dude come in to spell the Jays. We can’t be running 2 guard with 2 big lineups in the playoffs. Defensively our team works best with 3 switchable wings to guard tight on the perimeter and not let guys get to the paint. It worked great last season with Hayward and then Theis could man the paint while switching on PnR. The defense works less well with him as the 3rd wing and a less switchable big being attacked in PnR.  We don’t need to use all 28 right now, it can be split up. Also we’re hard capped (around 18 available) cuz of TT’s contract. Think targeting Harrison Barnes would be awesome or even Aaron Gordon. Just to get another big wing on the perimeter who’s better than Semi."
"&gt;Everything dray complained about: being professional, staying in shape, sitting games? Really? Players are expected to stay in shape? O no..   You are actually brain dead if you think this is dray point. I dont know what to explain anymore, just absolutely braindead.  He wasnt talking about that, he was talking about the EXPECTATION about that while they were treated SO WRONG by all the teams across the NBA. And also, braindead (I will call you this from now on), we ALL KNOW that trade is usual thing in the NBA, and yes, it is in the contract, but thats not the point. THE POINT IS THE WAY TEAM DOES THIS TRADE AND EXPECT PLAYERS JUST TO MAINTAIN THEIR PROFESSIONAL ATTITUDE DESPITE BEING TREATED SO WRONGLY BY THESE TEAMS.   YOU ARE BRAINDEAD IF YOU THINK WHAT HAPPEN TO DRUMMOND IS RIGHT, YOU ARE BRAINDEAD IF YOU THINK WHAT HAPPEN WITH HARRISON BARNES IS RIGHT, AND YOU ARE BRAINDEAD IF YOU THINK WHAT HAPPEN WITH HARDEN IS RIGHT. BRAINDEAD."
"Listening to Ainge on the radio he knows that we’re not in a position to contend right now but the impression I’m getting is that he’s not using our trade exception until the off season and not in a rush to make any big moves. Have heard names like Harrison Barnes, Terrence Ross tossed around as potential additions  Any players we could trade don’t have much value right now imo because nobody’s been playing well consistently other than the 2-3 players we aren’t going to trade. GMs also don’t want to be fleeced so any move we make is going to have to help the other team (sounds obvious) which means losing Smart, Rob and maybe Langford/Nesmith which isn’t ideal   The talent around the league has improved significantly and we haven’t so it seems like a waiting game unfortunately"
"I mean I guess he could be the third scoring option, sure, Harrison Barnes did that, but Draymond would still be the third best player by a decent margin."
Kristaps “Harrison Barnes” Porzingis
"&gt;Mavs trades NEVER get leaked.  I don't remember if there were leaks when you traded DeAndre, but I'm 100% that there was a leak about Harrison Barnes going to the Kings weeks before the trade actually happened."
"Yeah it feels like the Celtics have just been stockpiling assets for ages but doing absolutely nothing with them.       This season they'll probably use their TPE on someone like Harrison Barnes and call it a day, being perfectly content with not maximising their opportunity to truly go all the way, as is tradition."
i believe they can break it up and get multiple smaller contracts but yeah who are they going to trade for? harrison barnes? be my guest.
Could've had Turner lmao   Now the Celtics are begging the Kings to give up Harrison Barnes
"That team was stacked BECAUSE of Curry. If he wasnt on that team, that team would be a 6 or 7 seed in a tough west. I like klay, dray, and even harrison barnes and david lee. But Curry drove that bus."
"I'm admittedly very low on Langford but my point still stands in trying to draft older, win-now players next to your two stars.  I'd have to sit and think on a list but I'll take someone like Robert Covington for example. Your sub is begging the Kings to give up Harrison Barnes and Covington would've been a somewhat comparable player at the 4 who went for two firsts."
Harrison Barnes and Lebron cost his team the finals
Celtics fans begging the Kings to offload Harrison Barnes for Romeo Langford and 2 firsts rn
Celtics fans begging the Kings to offload Harrison Barnes for Romeo Langford and 2 firsts rn
"Trade Kemba for a big and defending playmaking guard (Lonzo). But no one in the league would take on his contract so we’ll probably have to add a 1st rounder to offload him too. On our sub, Harrison Barnes has been talked about a lot as a TPE target but not sure."
"Ah ok. Agreed on double teams being a problem. It is tough to see who to grab for bigs. They are prob rolling with who they have. I think they want to plug the wing problem more.   The problem with Cs fans is that there is an assumption that because Ainge is so active for trades, any player can be had (and the trades are always so lopsided). Right now, the big thing the Celts have is the trade exception. Harrison Barnes keeps getting floated out there. I dont know many details, but I guess he is important to the Kings. So why trade him? I guess Hield is also always been a target too. I think the Cs are looking at the Spurs in general, like maybe Derozan...? But would Pop be willing to just tank?"
"Celtics, please come get your slightly used Harrison Barnes."
Harrison Barnes
Harrison Barnes and Glenn Robinson are out with injuries. Whiteside has 5 fouls and was horrible. Kings were matching our small ball lineup with Bagley at center.
"At an individual level I would look at the style of play that Harden was playing through. This was before Dantoni turned James into a full time point guard but Harden’s usage rate was 31.3% where Curry at that time was at a 29% rate. Harden led the Rockets in scoring at 27 a game as well as led the team in assists at 7 a game. Harden’s second best player (a post back injury Dwight Howard) missed half the season and only averaged 29 minute a game when in. Harden had to deal with a multitude of different starting lineups due to injuries to Dwight, Terrence Jones, Ariza, and Beverly, that resulted in 6 different lineups just within the first 13 games. The Rockets still had a 10-3 record to start the year and the only player who was available for all those games was Harden. Within that same 13 game stretch, the warriors had the same lineup for all but 1 game where Harrison Barnes was out. Harden had to deal with a multitude of injuries to his support throughout the entire season where the starting 5 for the warriors were all together for at least 67 games of the season (Bogut missing the most time of the 5).  Harden was working with guys like Kostas Pap, Donatas Montejunas, Isaiah Cannan, Joey Dorsey and Correy Brewer for 50+ games and still somehow managed to crack 56 wins and a second seed.   The Warriors were awful last year but we can’t look past the moves that we’re made that makes this team better than last year’s. A 19 point game scorer last year in Kelly Oubre, a decent back up point in brad Wanamaker (which I know he’s been bad to start the year but he was solid in Boston), a rookie in wiseman that has added spark when playing, Kent Bazemors who adds outside shooting and versatility along the wing, and of course another year of development for guys like Paschel, Lee, and JT that have all looked better this season.   Curry is still dealing with a mid level team and I have no doubt they’ll be top 4 in the west next year with Klay back but to act like Curry is dealing with one of the worst teams or situations is going a little OD."
"I’ve never understood how he managed to stage a coup against Stockton. I get that he wasn’t exactly in his prime anymore, but John Stockton is one of the greatest players in Jazz history. He wasn’t even that bad of a player when he retired.   That would be like Harrison Barnes staging a coup against Dirk Nowitzski and forcing him to retire. I just can’t fathom something like that happening"
I thought that only the Harrison Barnes possession thing was a rumor.
"It IS a lot more than that. It is also:  •Staged a coup of John Stockton while he was on the Jazz, causing Stockton to retire.  •Cheated on his wife with a stripper, then getting blackmailed by the prostitute + some other guy, while at the same time being a born-again pastor  •Bristled at Mike Malone being the assistant coach under him (ownership wanted him to be the Associate Head Coach, like Gentry was with Kerr, but when Jackson found out he said NO WAY  •Didn't let assistant coaches do interviews with press because he thought they were gunning for his job  •Pushed Malone out because Jackson thought Malone was gunning for his job  •Ran ISO-ball all the time  •Instilled a ""us vs them"" where the ""them"" was the entire front office.

Harrison Barnes.....Barnseyyy
They became the team that had the best regular season in history*****  Would you honestly take that team over any other in history? Even over the next years version that swapped out Harrison Barnes for Kevin Durant?
I remember RJ on the warriors where he got benched for a rookie harrison barnes
How to spot a brand new Warriors fan in 1 second! Please tell me how many of those 73 wins Durant played in for the Warriors in the 2016 season. Do you think Harrison Barnes was on the 73 win team?
"Which ultimately is prolly too expensive to be reasonable. Brings us back to the beginning.  They're not making a run with a little less depth but Harrison Barnes, so what's the point?"
"2016 was the perfect storm of bad luck. Curry came back too soon from the MCL sprain and it showed the further into the playoffs they got.   Every. Single. One. Of Draymond's technical points was added on *after* the game. The play he got suspended for in no way should have resulted in him missing a finals game.   Then the Bogut leg fracture, Harrison Barnes forgetting how to shoot a basketball (3/36 over the last 3 games), and it still it took all time great performances from the Cavs to just barely beat the Dubs in the final minute of a game 7.  I don't think there should be any mark against Curry for how that played out personally."
Harrison Barnes
"Beg Sacramento for Harrison Barnes, probably."
He's Harrison Barnes 2.0
"Well yeah. No Warriors fan is gonna say he looks like he can carry a team, but the dude got sold with a first rounder to us. The fact that he can basically be a better Harrison Barnes when Klay comes back is getting us all hyped."
"/r/gonets goes fucking doomer and super pessimistic after every loss, which I'm sure every team subreddit does, I'm... I'm not sure if I want to see what /r/heat looks like right now.  And yea Thad Young or Collins would fill a huge Kelly Olynk sized hole for the Heat. Or someone like PJ Tucker or Harrison Barnes. Although seems like the Bulls are tryna still be competitive and Young is a key part of their team, and there's definitely a lot of interest for Collins from a bunch of teams, it'll be interesting to see what he goes for."
I can't believe the other guy put up a three hour debate on this. The 73-9 warriors replaced Harrison Barnes with Kevin Durant.   The 2009 Miami heats second best player was Beasley and third was a 50 Year old Jermaine O'Neal...
"MVP Steph Curry / All-NBA All-Defensive Klay Thompson / MVP Kevin Durant / All-Star Chris Mullin / All-Star DPOY Draymond Green   Bench: Andre Iguodala Tim Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, Chris Mullin, Monta Ellis, Harrison Barnes, David Lee, Andrew Bogut, Gilbert Arenas, Latrell Sprewell... sure I'm forgetting some people   Good luck Lebron lmao"
"I did not at all understand his reference to the Harrison Barnes trade. Front offices don’t stop working because games are being played. Does he think Harrison Barnes would want to keep playing in a game for a team that just traded him? Information leaks out in insane ways these days. A court side fan could have broken the news to him. Would that have been nicer? If he goes out and gets hurt, the deal is off. I just don’t really get his point."
"Which isn't helping them win games now and is a total crapshoot that expires in one year.  If they end up with the corpse of Lamarcus Aldridge instead of a Harrison Barnes or Eric Gordon, they'll regret it."
"1. Sign and trades are a thing, the players are usually notified beforehand. And most teams arent high on trading a player, so if they do its either because theyre a bad team fit (Al Horford, Josh Richardson) or the player themselves is disgruntled as has asked to be traded (Anthony Davis, KG, Ray Allen). And if a player has not asked to be traded, their careers are giving a better chance to succeed like we saw in the James Harden, Brandon Ingram, Kyle Lowry, Zach LaVine, etc. trades.   2. Rookie caps are (afaik) to protect teams ~~like the Timberwolves and Pistons~~ from making Joe Smith, Aaron Gordon, Harrison Barnes ass contracts. It sucks dick that players cant immediately choose their team, but as stated earlier they can demand a trade or even sit out games much like Jimmy Butler until they get traded or trades/signings are made to improve their team. I wouldnt mind if rookie caps are repealed, though. They are scaled depending on where in the draft you were taken, so theres that.   3. The fact players cant immediately cant choose their team is that it also gives small market teans (like the Cavaliers and Warriors) a chance to grow their status. If Lebron left Cleveland for somewhere like LA or Boston immediately on draft night the Cavs likely wouldnt be a franchise as of right now.  4. And I'm not entirely sure on this but I believe its possible to get a contract raise if youre already on a contract? I remember Dirk willingly taking pay cuts in order to improve his team but I'm not entirely sure on the other way around.   TL;DR theres a lot of ***nuance*** in these decisions made that make more sense if you look at them beyond face value."
"&gt; It is like signing up for a job that says you must wear a suit and tie to work, and then publicly complaining that your job makes you wear a suit and tie to work.  It's more like signing up for a job that says you must wear a suit and tie to work, but they have the right to change it to bikini's whenever they feel like it, including while you're at work (Harrison Barnes), but you cannot show up in anything other than what they say."
"1. About the Drummond situation, I don't think that Draymond has a problem with the Cavs not playing Drummond because he is on the trading block but rather how he was pulled from the bench and had to change attire, and continue to watch the game from the sidelines. If the organization wants him not to play, the proper way would be to inform the player before he arrives to the stadium to play to avoid the embarrassing situation that occured yesterday.   2. About Harrison Barnes being traded during a game and other players finding out from third-party or being straight-up lied to by GMs about where they stand with the team, players should be the first ones to find out if they have been traded so they can start preparing themselves and their FAMILIES without facing unwanted extra media attention. Furthermore, players should be informed if the team is entertaining trade offers for them so that they can mentally prepare themselves and their FAMILIES that they might have to relocate.  3. Thirdly, if the teams can publicly announce that they are going to trade a player, why can't a player publicly demand a trade? The team doesn't have to trade them if they don't want to. It's not like teams never leak information on players to the media without informing them.  4. If a player is going to be traded, and is not going to play why should he have to attend the games? What sense does it make for him to attend the games if he will inevitably be traded?  5. There is a reason trash teams remain trash. If Draymond was drafted by almost in any other team by the warriors, he would probably be out of the league right now. While young players like Markelle Fultz in Philadelphia, Lonzo Ball on the Lakers were constantly ridiculed for not living upto their potential; organizations such as the Portland Trailblazers never receive any backclash for ruining the career of a promising talent like Greg Oden by using experimental medical techniques; the San Antonio Spurs medical staff giving Kawhi Leonard the green light to play even with his constant protests, and later it was found out that he had several problems such as hematoma, tendinopathy, etc.  Finally, the NBA cannot be analysed in isolation of fans and media as they all exist in a nexus."
"I think draymonds core complaint is how the media and fans view teams vs. how they view players when it comes to individual agency. From my perspective he is complaining specifically about how when teams want to move on from a player it’s treated as a matter of fact, business as usual, while when a player wants to move on from a team, it’s treated as an affront to the system. Something that should be seen negatively and punished by the league through fines and other measures.   He makes a point in that, teams operate by a different set of rules and standards than players and a lot of the time the tendency to treat players as commodities to be bought and sold can lead to embarrassing and degrading moments for these players. He cites the Harrison barnes case and the boogie cousins all star game case as examples of this phenomenon. The Real Ones Ringer podcast’s Raja Bell had an interesting example of this also when he recounted a time Dion Waiters was traded right before a game in front of his family in Philadelphia where he’s from. They wouldn’t let him play in the game and because of League rules they couldn’t tell him where he was going and they couldn’t tell his family why he wasn’t playing. This sort of thing is certainly something that is thought of as a part of the business for teams to engage in but when a player asks out of a situation in a sudden way then he is ridiculed and called out as selfish.   I heard draymonds words as addressing this sort of double standard around the league. Also when you think about it, being able to unilaterally trade players is kinda an insane part of sports that we kinda just accept but would really upset people if it took place in their business. So maybe I’m just a victim of confirmation bias but I happen to agree with draymonds words as I interpreted them."
"Draymond spoke for a little over 2 minutes and not once did he ask for a rule change. What he’s asking for is that front offices across the league get their shit together. Danny Green went on JJ Redick’s podcast and praised the Lakers for how  they handled his trade this past offseason, and Quinn Cook had similar remarks about being waved by them. You misconstrued Draymond’s very first sentence, where he talks about seeing Andre Drummond begin his pre-game warmup then return from the locker room in street clothes because he had only just then been informed that he was being held out.   I think Draymond stumbled a bit when he brought up Harden because the heat Harden took was less about his trade request and more about the fact that the organization bent over backwards to put a winning team around him, shuffling in one all star after another and constructing the roster specifically around his offensive talents, all for him to say “we’re not good enough” when the reality is that he’s been underachieving. But even then, the fallout from his trade request was something Houston’s FO anticipated. The GM was quoted as having said “We’re prepared for things to get uncomfortable” and that’s what happened.   Draymond overall point is that there’s a right way to do these things, and when an organization fumbles away a player’s prime years-or even when they don’t and they just wanna trade that player for whatever reason there’s a way to go about it. When Harrison Barnes was traded mid game LeBron spoke up about it that very night on Twitter. There was no reason the team’s broadcasting crew should know before the player. Maybe you call that player before he leaves for the game and tell him he’s being held out because you’re close on a trade? Maybe you tell DeMarcus Cousins before he leaves town for AS Weekend and that you’re working towards trading him and hope to have something done by the weekend? There’s a right way to do this sort of thing and that’s what separates first class organizations from the rest of the pack. That’s what Draymond was talking about."
"He’s gone from one of the worst contracts in the league to an expensive but solid two-way contributor. He’s arguably an upgrade over Harrison Barnes, who the Warriors would’ve had to offer a similar contract to if the KD signing didn’t go through. With a healthy Klay back (god willing) I think Wiggins will make a fine third option."
This guy is talking out of his ass not doing proper research beforehand. It's an [NBA.com article](https://www.nba.com/news/report-harrison-barnes-traded-kings) FFS.
"[Barnes was warned](https://www.nba.com/news/report-harrison-barnes-traded-kings) by his agent before the game that he might be traded soon, had the option to sit out, but decided he will play. He even stayed with the team after being benched and news about the trade got out. He was the perfect professional but calling this "" indicative of unprofessional behavior by the team"" is, well...you missed a lot of context with this reply."
"Bulls could give up porter for him if they wanted him  The mavs could give James Johnson and one of a few others   The nuggets have a few players on pretty big contracts that are tradable  Warriors could give Wiggins  The rockets got olidipo, or Gordon  The griz have a bunch of things they could give  The heat have iggy and Kelly   The t wolves have Ricky  Pelicans have adams  Okc had al horford   The magic have Gordon  The trail blazers have nurkic + another little bit   The kings have Harrison Barnes   San antonio has LA  The wiz have bertons  I could argue all those players are non essential. And Ik a lot of them ofc would never trade for Drummond but most teams have tradable pieces for Drummond"
Firing Dave was a mistake.  We'll have to see if not trading Harrison Barnes was too.
"Pacers with Justin holiday and levert, magic with bacon and carter jr, kings with buddy hield and Harrison Barnes"
"Harrison Barnes, drafted high, been a starter for most of his career, won a ring, been paid a good amount."
Harrison Barnes would have been 2017 finals MVP since he stayed with the warriors
"They decided to compete for the playoff too early. They told teams they were keeping Harrison Barnes so they could make a run at the play in. That should tell you where their priorities lie.    They should have tanked one final time this season with such a stacked draft. They blew the Bagley pick and got lucky Haliburton wanted to play specifically for them. They don't have the talent to be trying to rush out of their rebuild.   Now they're in purgatory. Too good to get a high draft pick, too bad to make the playoffs."
"Harrison Barnes over KD, he was the starting SF to win it first lmao"
"All of mavs moves were so we can get the cap space to go for Giannis, plus they did not wanted to overpay him.  Since he signed for Milwaukee their trades look stupid and useless now.  I agree that we should have kept and overpaid Harrison Barnes.  The fans did not want him because he had a tunnel vision and could not execute the role he was given.  But him playing as a 3&amp;D wing in limited role would make us better and we could move DFS to the bench."
"Steph did not change anything, why do people keep saying this?  Pace changed because Houston started chucking up threes and analytics blew up   Warriors were not even like  big chuckers, Warriors after firing Jackson who played iso Harrison Barnes went back to motion offense   Curry is the GOAT shooter but Morey's teams were shooting threes and doing the threes and layup thing before that, ever since he traded Harden for that reason, Houston went from 10th in threes to top 1 or top 2 every year"
"The kings have been so successful since getting Harrison Barnes, meanwhile the mavs have done absolutely nothing since dumping him."
Harrison Barnes=Tim Hardaway Jr.  Cant change my opinion
"Harrison Bryce Jordan Barnes (born May 30, 1992) is an American professional basketball player who plays for the Sacramento Kings of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the North Carolina Tar Heels before being selected by the Golden State Warriors in the first round of the 2012 NBA draft with the seventh overall pick. Barnes won an NBA championship with the Warriors in 2015."
Well thats the issue with using First Take narrative shaping to analyze a basketball game. Harrison Barnes missed a significant amount of open shots in a series that had 4 point differential.  Bullshit it wasn't his fault.
How do you think these things work? You think when teams lose a championship they aren’t immediately thinking of ways to get better and avoid losing happening again? Like I get what you’re trying to say but this “weak” is so dumb LMAO. They had a Golden opportunity to replace Harrison Barnes (who was god awful that series BTW) with Kevin fucking Durant and pounced on quickly like any smart person would
The this he was referring to was Harrison Barnes clanking away a title. They needed a 3 and kd was the best 3 they could afford
"That’s right. True competitors have Zero respect for the greatest player of their generation. When an all time great player wants to join their team? They say FUCK NO!!! We want to overpay Harrison Barnes!!! That’s what it’s all about babey. Not reading replies to this btw, Mom says my computer hour is up and I gotta go play outside now"
"You mean the team with Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Harrison Barnes, Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston, and Andrew Bogut?"
"If Sabonis is a glorified Harrell, RJ is a discount Harrison Barnes."
"People always underrated it because he got attacked almost nonstop in the first couple years of them being good, but in reality he was just an around league average defender sharing the court with Andre Igoudala, Draymond Green, Harrison Barnes, Klay Thompson, and Andrew Bogut. So that’s 2 of the top 15(IMO) non big defensive players of all time; one of the best two way shooting guards of the last 15 years; a 2nd team all defense level Rim protector; and an above wing Defender with a lot of versatility. It’s hard to not to look bad when other team exclusively scheme to attack you."
"Yeah maybe, he didnt play very good, but its not like he just missed wide open shots, cavs played some really physical and good defense to make sure he didnt get any open looks, it also didnt help Harrison barnes couldn't throw it in the ocean, but yeah sure he didnt play great in 2016, he did however play great in 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019. Meaning 4 out of the 5 finals hes been in hes played great. So back to my original reply, steph plays great in the finals"
his Harrison Barnes rants were the stuff of legend
"Swap out Harrison Barnes for Kevin Love and I think that's the ""1st team All-bad-money"""
Harrison Barnes at 20 million a year is honestly good value
Harrison Barnes who was pretty good. And is now what an 18 ppg guy. From the 7th pick. Not exactly a bust.
tanked for harrison barnes who later became the cap space for KD.
"Warriors definitely ""tanked"" for the Harrison Barnes draft pick, I think Utah was going to get it if it fell out of top 7.   And that's acceptable ""tanking"", the Sixers just took it to the next level by completely writing off 3 seasons."
Harrison Barnes
They tanked for Harrison Barnes lol
"I mean, yeah. But this isn’t anything new bc the track record holds true. Edwards had bad shot selection at every level of ball, haliburton was always a genius level decision maker. Would u see Edwards have an uptick in efficiency playing next to.. Harrison barnes? I guess? But he still takes his long 2s, contested 3s early in the clock, stops short of a clear drive to pull up. A big chunk of his efficiency woes are self inflicted"
"But don't you think that has to do with personnel? It's easier to process the game when you have more capable guys like De'Aaron Fox, Buddy Hield and Harrison Barnes playing alongside of you."
"Lol, but its mostly the truth. Watch how the timeouts worked during those years. Malone would come out with the clipboard and call the plays, while Mjax is standing on the side.  During the audio cuts in Mjax would tell the team to ""focus on defense"", or ""get to your spots"", ""get rebounds"" to refocus the team. Theres nothing wrong with that, a good head coach has lean on his assistant coaches.  The most important thing Mjax did to that group was give them the confidence that they are good and instill a defensive mentality. Which most Warrior fans will give him credit for.  But he would also make Harrison Barnes chuck contested jumpers with the second unit, and make hockey substitutions that would kill all momentum. Theres a reason why we gave away so many leads in 2012/2013. Not to mention all the other drama/B.S that was associated with him."
"Killian was the 7th overall pick in what many considered a weak draft.  If he ends up being a guy who averages 15/5/5 on 39% shooting and is a great passer with the ability to defend I am happy with it.  You can't ask for much more out of the 7th pick. You can see the list of 7th overall picks below:     * 2019: Coby White, Bulls. * 2018: Wendell Carter Jr., Bulls. * 2017: Lauri Markkanen, Timberwolves. * 2016: Jamal Murray, Nuggets. * 2015: Emmanuel Mudiay, Nuggets. * 2014: Julius Randle, Lakers. * 2013: Ben McLemore, Kings. * 2012: Harrison Barnes, Warriors"

"You make it sound like they've been making a ton of top 10 draft picks during Kerr's run as coach. Late first round picks and second rounders tend to not be good. The last top 10 pick the Warriors had was Harrison Barnes, who only played for Kerr in his 3rd and 4th seasons."
Harrison Barnes was insane the first 2 quarters
"Eh.  Dream scenario would have been Fox + Mitchell/Bam from that draft, but you got Harrison Barnes out of it. Not like Monk or Collins would have been a better return than Barnes."
trading Jackson and Zbo for Harrison Barnes is the best move Vlade ever made
"Wiseman should not be traded, yes he could probably have gotten them someone pretty sick that was selling. The issue is that they have $35 million in a player that cannot play and they will not trade. Really the whole squad is just fucked because of the injury to Klay and that really hurts.   I mean possible scenarios could've been trading Wiseman for a guy like Jonas Valanciunas, Wiseman and a bench guy could've easily gotten the deal done and they'd have replaced a growing center with an underrated veteran center. Another good option would've been Oubre and filler for Harrison Barnes. That actually would've been a legendary trade and really reignited some classic Warriors magic with the 73-9 core getting back together.   Damn I really wish they could've traded Oubre and filler for Harrison Barnes"
"Because calling it the ""biggest differential of all time"" is hella disrespectful to vucevic, who is an all star and a great player in his own right. There has been so many other situations where ""the differential"" is bigger, for example Harrison barnes to KD."
Did Harrison Barnes ever have one?
Harrison Barnes has been really perfecting his slow motion euro step move  It almost feels like they should be travels lol but it works so well
"You'd be surprised how fickle (dumb?) some of our fan base is. They think a team that hasn't had a top 10 pick since Harrison Barnes should've drafted three All-Stars by now to replace Steph/Klay/Dray. Some of the newer fans and bangwagon fans just don't understand how the league works and have been spoiled by unsustainable success.  I'll go to bat for Myers. Poole, Paschall, McCaw, and Bell were fine draft picks...for where they were taken. He turned KD's exit into D'Lo, which became Wiggins + a possible top 5 pick. That's a W.   His FA moves have been a little dicey, but it's not like the team is rolling in cap space. Klay going down was a huge, huge story and I think maybe only now people are waking up to realize that it effectively ended GSW's season before it began.  Jury's still out on the Wiseman pick, but there's enough hope there to stay calm. It's really just a lot of panic from spoiled fans. I can't explain it any other way. Five straight years in the Finals totally warped their expectations."
Except Manu is 10 times the player Harrison Barnes is and KD is 10 times the player AI is
This is the equivalent of Golden State saying we want Harrison Barnes + bench   Instead of KD. Since they won 73 games with HB and that bench   Talent should be a priority over fit
"Argentina beat USA with a team that had basically no NBA players in 2019. I'm not sure how many players exactly in their team is in Euroleague now but I'm sure it'll be somewhat competitive. For reference here's the team USA squad that year  &gt; The official 2019 USA World Cup Team includes 2016 Olympic gold medalist **Harrison Barnes** (Sacramento Kings); **Jaylen Brown** (Boston Celtics); **Joe Harris** (Brooklyn Nets); **Brook Lopez** (Milwaukee Bucks); **Khris Middleton** (Milwaukee Bucks); **Donovan Mitchell** (Utah Jazz); 2014 World Cup gold medalist **Mason Plumlee** (Denver Nuggets), **Marcus Smart** (Boston Celtics); **Jayson Tatum** (Boston Celtics); **Myles Turner** (Indiana Pacers); **Kemba Walker** (Boston Celtics); and **Derrick White** (San Antonio Spurs).   Not great, but still respectable. If we are going by the worst of the NBA, e.g. Rockets, I think that Euro will win."
"Jordan Poole like like he will be a legit scoring guard off the bench.   Warriors haven't started 10 players in five years either...  2015 was Looney with the 30th, he worked himself into a reliable rotation player.  2016 was Damian Jones, a raw, athletic center prone to fouling. Probably won't be in the league much longer.  2018 was Jacob Evans with the 28th pick, he never worked out.   2019 was Eric Paschall, someone who may not quite fit this roster but was a steal with the 41st pick and was all rookie first team.  That year was also when they selected Jordan Poole who looks like he will be a legit player. 28th pick.  Then of course 2020's #2, James Wiseman, who isn't very good but as a young, raw big man that's kind of expected. I believe he will be a great player.  They only had late 2nd round picks that year but Mannion already has given some ball handler minutes off the bench and Justinian Jessup is doing well in Australia.  It's rare to draft great players when you draft really low and expect for 2020 the Warriors have drafted really low. Despite that I think they've done well.  Also while Curry was a gift from the departing ownership/Larry Riley it was the new ownership and front office who drafted with better picks. Who did they select?  Klay Thompson with the 11th, Harrison Barnes with the 7th, Draymond Green with the 35th and Festus Ezeli with the 30th.  Stacked up against any other team during the last ten years I think the Warriors have drafted much better than average."
"Friendly reminder that of the past 100 top 10 draft picks ( 2009-2019 draftees ), the only 5 to even reach the Finals with their draft team are: Harrison Barnes, Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, James Harden, and Stephen Curry.  And two of those wouldn't have made it without a certain free-agent acquisition.  So while building a winner high in the draft is a nice idea, its recent track record is bleak, at best.  The preceding decade was just a little better, with 7 out of 100: Westbrook, Durant, Bynum, Howard, Wade, Kenyon Martin, and Paul Pierce.  Of those 12 players, only 5 were top 3 picks and just 3 were first overall."
"&gt; What above-replacement-level player are you getting at slot #30  After Harrison Barnes in 2012, the highest pick they had was no. 28 until Wiseman. You really have to cherry pick to say he missed out on guys."
"Ya, and Brady was taking paycuts during his time with the pats.  (Which creates an unfair scenario)   It's the equivalent of giving Kawhi a deal that is about Harrison Barnes level money, gives the team so much to work with  But taking paycuts is for chumps"

"Yes they would, if the y are attracting so much attention on defense that their SF gets wide open shots lol  That literally happened in ever Finals vs the Cavs, be it Harrison Barnes or Kevin Durant himself. The Cavs knew who would break them."
I kinda forgot Harrison Barnes is 9-10  Why hasn't he shot it more
Buddy Heild is not a Lakers killer tonight. Harrison Barnes is tho
Kings complaining about no calls when Harrison Barnes is trucking our players. Rich
So Harrison Barnes is gonna put a career high up  smh
"Also bear in mind that the Warriors haven't had a top 15 draft pick since Harrison Barnes. When you are running deep in the playoffs every year, you don't get much draft capital to play with. I think he's done decently in the draft to get Bell, McCaw, Paschall, and Poole with very late picks. None of them are amazing, but you have to consider where they were chosen.  The Klay thing is simple bad luck. Steph and Dray were also out tonight. Perfect storm for a drubbing. The only real blemish right is that Wiseman is looking spotty at times, but he's so young/raw that this is really a redshirt year. He could be a different player in 2-3 years.   Myers also did really well to get D'Lo for KD, and then to flip D'Lo for Wiggins and a potential top 5-6 pick. That was quite a great move."
Harrison Barnes gonna go off again just like last time lmao
His free agency coincided with the Durant signing. Warriors renounced his rights (along with Harrison Barnes') to make room to sign Durant.
You don't even need to be better than the other 3 and D guy. You just got to be good enough to contribute and have the composure to play well when it matters most. Harrison Barnes is a good 3 and D guy and probably better than JR Smith or whoever was the cavs 3 and D but he fell apart when it mattered most and his team didn't get a ring because of it (in addition to cavs stars hitting clutch buckets but if Harrison is even just mediocre in that game I think that goes the other way)
"since 2000 Nene, Kirk Hinrich, Luol Deng, Corey Brewer, Steph Curry, Greg Monroe, Bismack Biyombo, Harrison Barnes, Ben McLemore, Julius Randle, Emmanuel Mudiay, Lauri Markennen, and Coby White have all been picked at 7. Of that group Murray is one of the better players, but ""well above expected value,"" seems like a stretch."
"&gt; Harrison Barnes (close)  I love Harrison Barnes, but he's nowhere close to Murray lol"
"The most-recently-drafted Top 10 draft pick to even play in the Finals is Kentavious Caldwell-Pope -- drafted #8 overall by the Pistons in 2013.  The most-recently-drafted Top 10 pick to play in the Finals with his draft team was Harrison Barnes -- #7 overall by the Warriors in 2012.  Of the past 100 top 10 picks -- 2009 through 2019 -- only Barnes, Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, James Harden, and Stephen Curry have even played in the Finals with their draft team.  &amp;#x200B;  This idea that a team just needs a first-round pick to win is not well supported."
"I know he's hurt, and I know he was hurt in 2019.  But man are we still surprised ? every season no matter if it's injury related or not since 2014 he's like that : 2 months at an MVP level, the rest of the season he's Harrison Barnes basically. Idk if his body just can't sustain a full season or something like that but we've seen it already"
Harrison barnes close to playoff god murray?
&gt; Harrison Barnes (close)  Read this again but slower
Harrison Barnes and Eric Gordon?
"Just looked at all the 7th overall picks, and these are the players close to or better than Murray for me. Harrison Barnes (close), Stephen Curry, Eric Gordon (had solid years, and won a 6th man of the year), Rip Hamilton, Kevin Johnson, Chris Mullin, Alvin Robertson, Bernard King, and John Havlicek. From 1950s to today. So it's pretty rare, but not *that* rare."
"ppl just remember Harrison Barnes from 2 things on here: hyped recruit &amp; warriors playoff run where he was bad. No one on this sub watches games, especially not Kings games (no slight to you, Warriors were like that a little over a decade ago too lol), so they won't know but he really is and has been not only a solid player for a minute but a solid vet and just great guy to have on any team. Overpaid a little tho"
"Sounds like the Harrison Barnes special, pretty fitting lol."
"He's basically playing the Harrison Barnes role for them and doing it slightly better. He's a good fit as a 4th/5th starter, he just has a superstar's contract."
"Here's the copypasta, more or less.  - Staged a coup of John Stockton while he was on the Jazz, causing Stockton to retire.  - Cheated on his wife with a stripper, then getting blackmailed by the prostitute + some other guy, while at the same time being a born-again pastor  - Bristled at Mike Malone being the assistant coach under him (ownership wanted him to be the Associate Head Coach, like Gentry was with Kerr, but when Jackson found out he said NO WAY  - Didn't let assistant coaches do interviews with press because he thought they were gunning for his job  - Pushed Malone out because Jackson thought Malone was gunning for his job  - Ran ISO-ball all the time  - Instilled a ""us vs them"" where the ""them"" was the entire front office. He would tell the players that the front office didn't want them to win so that Mark Jackson would look bad. C'mon that's lunacy  - Barred Jerry West and Jim Barnett (the beloved TV color guy) along with everyone else from practices so they couldn't hear the crazy shit he said to the team  - Told the team Ezeli was rooting for them to lose so that Ezeli would look better (he was injured). This culminated in Ezeli in tears saying that there was no way he would do this, when confronted by the team  - Told the team that Harrison Barnes was possessed by a demon, which is why he regressed  - Darren Erman, the assistant responsible for the defense after Mike Malone left, was recording Mark Jackson surreptitiously to try and capture the crazy shit like the Harrison Barnes demon thing and the Ezeli thing, but was caught and fired  - Noted homophobe, including the ""I'll pray for him"" when discussing Jason Collins coming out. This doesn't fly in the bay area when a lot of the team staff is gay and so is the front office, including the COO/President Rick Welts  - Didn't want to hire actual good assistants, instead, he hired yes-men like Pete Myers and Lindsay Hunter, who backstabbed Alvin Gentry in Phoenix to get the head job  - All the coaching staff were allying themselves with star players instead of the players who actually needed their help/development, so a lot players like Barnes didn't get the development time and help they needed  - He put players against each other, telling a star player ""hey that bench thinks he's better than you"" and then telling the bench guy ""hey that star guy thinks you're shit, go take his job""  - Didn't get along with anyone in the front office, including Jerry West, Bob Myers, and actually the rest of the employees (marketing, PR, etc) No preparation. He said in the Clippers series that he didn't need to prepare extra hours, when Doc Rivers was up all night devising schemes Not to mention that he was just a really horrible coach. I'm sure I left out a lot of stuff.  Post-coaching shitty things he did:  - Saying rim protectors are obsolete, which threw shade on Bogut, and then saying Deandre Jordan was the DPOY (over Draymond) because of his rim protection  - Wanting to take credit for Kerr's success talking about caterpillars and butterflies  - Saying Curry was not the MVP, which is fair, but not what you expect someone to say when Curry went to bat to keep Jackson's job. Maybe thought Curry didn't try hard enough, which is bullshit since Curry tried very hard and stumped for Jackson personally  - Saying Curry was ruining the game"

"&gt; most of the reason he fell to 16 was that teams knew he would struggle to play due to anxiety tho. he would have gone top 5 easily  This is just revisionist history.  In a draft with Anthony Davis, MKG (lol), Bradley Beal, Andre Drummond, and Harrison Barnes -- all of whom were one and done elite prospects -- as well as Dion Waiters and Damian Lillard, no one was going to pick 21 year-old Royce White in the top 5.  And Thomas Robinson, the actual Player of the Year in White's conference, was also picked ahead of him.  He was a fringe top 10 pick with no baggage."
Warriors tanked at the end to make sure that we kept the draft pick that became Harrison Barnes. His last memory w/ Warriors was brick city but I don’t know if we get past Grizzlies w/o his interior defense vs ZBo/Gasol.
"WTF dude. 2011 Mavs had Marrion, Chandler, Terry, and JJ all averaging more than Kidd. I’d take 2015 Draymond anyday over Dion. They also had Harrison Barnes which is 10x better than Dion"
"He’s 26, averaging 18/5/2 with 40% from 3 (21 ppg in March), and may well make All-Defense this year. Someone would probably give him 4/90m, maybe 4/100m if he’s lucky. For comparison, Harrison Barnes got 4/85m as a 26 year old who averaged 16/5/2 with 40% from 3."
"&gt; ""No way [man](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/mavs-dirk-nowitzki-tells-harrison-barnes-what-it-takes-to-reach-20-years-in-the-nba/). You need major skill to get to 20 years."""
"whatever helps you sleep at night  everyone else that's not nut hugging kd can see he couldn't lead okc while having amazing supporting casts.   that's why he needed to join a 73 win team and take harrison barnes places for free rings. In case you forgot, that core already won in 2015."
"finals MVP with a 73 win team lol. Those were currys team. Replacing harrison barnes and hopping on the best team in the league for rings doesn't mean anything.   he couldn't lead his team in okc. After 2012, he got worse every year in the playoffs.   and yes they were stacked. Remember you said they were perennial WCF team? Remember they were up 3-1 on warriors. I don't think any other superstar would leave teams like that. Most would be able to win.   you clearly just started watching ball recently and just stan KD hard as you can. You're too blindly in love with KD to even acknowledge russells talent, so not point in even wasting time with you on that."
"Harrison Barnes did this with the Warriors. It probably cost him a ring or two, but he wanted to get paid is read so I guess he won"
"Theirs many teams that could use him and his skill set so he could be worth more. Plus hes still young. Lakers will wait to see how he does in the playoffs first.if they are impressed i think 22-25 mil for 4 years would be fair.   For comparison, heres other notable players in that range:  Buddy Heid  Harrison Barnes  Fred Vanvleet"
"I said Durant himself didnt improve, not that the team didnt.  They replaced HARRISON BARNES with KD. No shit they were gonna improve..."
"You have a point but like Harrison Barnes shot, no way that was less than 1.6 seconds. You have to account human reaction time. Plus he’s a super star. They bend the rules for them all the time"
We were going to re-sign Harrison Barnes if KD didn’t come
It matters but is there really a big difference in Kawhi/Simmons guarding the best players on ball than mid level defenders like Mo Harkless or Harrison Barnes or something? How much more do they really slow them down?
"There are a lot of problems with the NBA cap and salary rules.  The biggest IMO is the max salary rule.  There is no way a team should be able to afford Durant, Harden, and Kyrie Irving, but the max salary is artificially lower than market value for those guys.  Meanwhile, small market teams (or teams with a competitive disadvantage of being in another country like Toronto) have to give max contracts to lesser stars like Gordon Hayward, Harrison Barnes, Pascal Siakam, etc. in the hopes that they develop or play up to their contract.  Meanwhile large market teams get to compete for the real stars, and they have enough money to apparently sign 3-4 of them because the max contract is artificially low and the salary cap is flexible."
"Harrison Barnes, good players, provides what he should also a good vet and locker room guy"
"In the 2016 NBA Finals, LeBron took one of the most important shots in basketball history over Andre Iguodala. The Warriors had a 3-1 lead in that series, but LeBron willed his team to greatness, Kyrie started to deliver, and the Warriors were losing a step due to getting banged up, aided in a large part by LeBron's aggressive and physical defense, and Harrison Barnes did his best Game 7 Starks immitation over the last three games, but they were still dangerous, they were still in the game, and they were still favorites despite everything.  Andre Iguodala is one of the greatest one on one defenders basketball has ever known. Come playoff time, he is the guy that can see the cracks in the defense and fill that gap with ridiculous mobility and skill. He won a Finals MVP on that skill, somewhat successfully aimed at LeBron.  As LeBron was about to release, let's take a deep rewind on LeBron's jumper.  Young LeBron sucked at shooting. We're talking ""very young"", since he entered the league at 18. It didn't matter, because he was just that good. It didn't matter also because his team was just that bad so he was going to do his thing and it would be the best for his team. But what made it really not matter was that no opponent could deny him his bread and butter.  So in 2007, the Cavs had only one card to play: give ball to LeBron. Now, a young LeBron James was a freakish athlete, and could already pick a part a defense when going downhill. At 22, he was already one of the best players in basketball. The two major knocks people had on his game? Two skills: the post up, and the jumper. Everything other than that he was already an outlier due to being not only one of the greatest athletes ever, but also because of his exceptional mind for the game.  Since basketball is perhaps the only major sport where one man can just take over, giving the ball to LeBron was a very, *very* good card for the Cavs to play.  It got them to the finals.  Yes, the East was weak, as the Celtics were one year from the Big 3, the Bulls didn't have Rose yet and Orlando were just figuring things out. The Pistons were physically done. LeBron was too athletic, had too much energy, was too relentless. The Cavs gave him the ball over and over, and he won that series. It remains one of the most extreme carry jobs ever.  Facing them were the meatgrinder that were the Spurs at the height of their power. The Tim Duncan Spurs had won less than 50 games in only one season. That was during the lockout, and they won the championship that year after shredding through everyone. A fifty win season in that two decade stretch was considered a *failure*. There was no such thing as not making the playoffs.  They were bigger, stronger, tougher, and smarter than more or less everyone. They had who is now considered by many one of the greatest coaches (if not The greatest) in the history of basketball in Greg Poppovich. They were battle tested multiple time champions, having fought through everything the league had to offer year after year. They were better than the Cavaliers at everything except ""having LeBron James"".  Poppovich built The Wall. Three people between LeBron and the rim, completely smothering his lanes by putting too much muscle even for LeBron to plow through. Short of LeBron reliably hitting his shots away from the rim, someone else on that terrible Cavs team was going to have to win the series.  It did not go well.  The Spurs dismantled the Cavs with contemptuous ease. LeBron couldn't shoot, the rest of the team was bad, and the help defense was Tim Duncan. It's not a knock on any player or any team in history losing to a team like that. They were a force of nature.  But even for a sweep, it was absolutely brutal. It wasn't a fair contest. You could give the Cavs 10 games and they probably wouldn't have won any. Against a team with the greatest stretch of dominance other than the Michael Jordan era Bulls, the Showtime Lakers, and the Russell Celtics, at their best, nothing was going to matter. They could force LeBron away from the rim, and the only card the Cavaliers had to play was rendered toothless. He still put up numbers, but there was no winning strategy behind those points, only the best he could do.  It was hard to watch.  It was, to someone who can only be described as insanely dedicated to winning, probably much harder to live through. What the Bad Boys did to MJ, the Spurs did to LeBron. They exposed a weakness in his game had cost him what he really wanted - the chance to win. He immediately got to work on fixing that. At first, it was only to force teams to play honest defense against him. But after he started taking charge of the Miami offense he had figured out his spots. He was extending his range, improving his reliability, becoming less position dependent, and you can see it in his shooting stats across the board.   In 2015, largely because of Andre Iguodala's defensive performance, his jumper was questioned yet again - someone just kept getting in his face and his percentage dropped. This cannot be any more of an understatement, but LeBron really doesn't like losing. People in the media kept pointing out his finals record over and saying he just loses. After his fifth straight finals, people were finding reasons to doubt him. He used that as even more motivation.  In the following season, that shot became a true elite weapon. More than percentage, it was reliability. This didn't really have much of an impact in the regular season, because LeBron treats the regular season as summer league, and at this point he was focused on a championship.  They made the finals with ease. And this time, LeBron was hitting the shots that Iguodala took away last series. And when he took that shot - you can make a case that what started in 2007 finally ended, as he had beat one of the strongest teams in history, his performance could be described as arguably the greatest single-player masterpiece in NBA history. The Warriors were *that* good. LeBron was even better.  In 2017, LeBron tried hitting that shot again in a pivotal game three, and it was Andre Iguodala, remembering that specific move and having practiced specifically for it, who evaporated the Cavaliers hopes of a repeat with one of the greatest defensive stops in finals history, as the Warriors took their vengeance, in maybe the strongest season of basketball ever played.  tl;dr: Zion is actually shooting better from mid-range than LeBron was at that age."
"Minnesota Timberwolves at Sacramento Kings December 26, 2019  Final Score: MIN 105 SAC 104 after 2OT  Some of the worst shooting performances I have ever seen. All of these players had more shot attempts than points.  Andrew Wiggins: 4/19 (2/9 from 3)  Jeff Teague: 5/17 (1/6 from 3)  Harrison Barnes 2/12 (2/4 from 3)  Buddy Hield 6/20 (3/11 from 3)  Bogdan Bogdanovic 8/28 (3/16 from 3)"
He's getting Harrison Barnes money
That was Harrison Barnes.  Poor guy got caught in the crossfire .  And he's only slightly overpaid anyways
"You guys are spoiled. Even getting playable big wings is hard in the NBA these days, there's a reason guys like Harrison Barnes and Otto Porter keep getting huge contracts. Brandon Ingram is a huge plus at that position, even on his current max contract."
That shot was as Harrison Barnes as Harrison Barnes' shots get.
"**teleports behind you.**   ""Heh, nothing personnel kid"" -Harrison Barnes."
"Holy fucking shit what a shot, first version I saw didn’t have the score so I assumed it was a tie game. Down by 1 and this beauty goes in? I’ve said a lot of Harrison Barnes slander but god damn what a fucking bucket"
"as a Warriors fan, watching a clutch Harrison Barnes shot against the CAVALIERS is ironic af lol"
NGL I thought this was Matt Barnes for a second when I read the title and before I watched the clip. I was confused af. Sorry Harrison with a shot like that you deserve more respect from my aging nba brain
"&gt; I think it's more of overpaid players are getting bought out.   No. If these players had any value to the team buying them out they'd still be under contract. The team is still paying them most of the money and taking the cap hit. They just have no need for them. So they do it for the player and a tiny bit of money savings. There are plenty of players like Harrison Barnes, D-Lo or Andrew Wiggins that are overpaid but will never be bought out. They have some value to their teams even if it's not what they're worth."
"Yeah but no FO in the history of the NBA would say “nah, I’m good, we’re gonna run it back with Harrison Barnes” if you have a chance to add a Kevin Durant in the offseason."
Gay hasn’t played for us in years... that’s Harrison Barnes you jamoke.  Ps your team’s fans eat literal horse shit
Harrison Barnes doing us a solid once again.
De'aron Fox/  Tyrese Haliburton/  Luka Doncic/  Harrison Barnes/  Richaun Holmes/   Sheesh that line-up could compete with anyone in the league. Legitimately one BPA away in 2018.  If you're going to pick Bagley at least trade back to pick-up an asset to compensate for your dumb ass pick.
"measuring with win shares is hilariously bad analytics. he's like 1.5% better this season than last season. great. also a chorus of ""already better than harrison barnes"" he's worse than harrison in metric thats actually a metric lol"
"There’s not much debate that he’s overpaid, but if he can be the team’s modern Harrison Barnes, that’s not so bad!   Also, if the Minny picks conveys this year, the Dubs should be charged with robbery as a result of this trade."
Matt Barnes not Harrison Barnes
If you had to pick one would you rather have Wiggins or Harrison Barnes?
"Honestly im in complete agreement with you in that wiggins is getting more of a spotlight. And dude definitely aint worth his contract rn. And most of all dont even go near the warriors subreddit you dont even want hear how delusional some fans are. (Im sure you have tho lol). Yet at the end if the day i think that wiggins can be solid for us. I can really see him playing a harrison barnes role for us, but actually pretty consistent. I think alot of dubs fans realize that he isnt gonna have to be a big time scorer for us. Just play great defense and cut when draymond or curry has the ball. But yeah his contract is really way too much."
Would you maybe think he’ll fill a Harrison Barnes type of role when Klay comes back?
"You can absolutely rather want D'Angelo Russell, but all of your complaints about Wiggins here generally apply to D'Lo too, plus injuries. On top of that, Russell makes just $2M less per year for the duration of their contracts. An inconsequential amount with no real cap implications. Now, if you want to bring up overall roster fit, then D'Angelo compliments KAT and now Edwards much more as the point guard...whereas Wiggins would just be another swingman scorer taking up a big chunk of the cap. That would make sense, and why both teams were happy with the trade (even if you exclude the pick, which is now essentially gravy).   Wiggins as the third option is perfect for us. They're asking him to fill the role of 2014-2016 Harrison Barnes on offense, while locking in on defense. That's it, and it's such a relatively low bar. On defense, thank God we have him because there's no way we can rely on Klay to be our first option perimeter defender coming back from two major injuries. We'll see."
"You are overvaluing Wiggins. He’s an average defender and an average scorer (at best).   You could find guys like Dejountae Murray, Kelly Oubre (yes I know), Lonzo Ball, Tim Hardaway Jr, even Harrison Barnes.  I tried to choose guys not on rookie contracts cuz that’s not fair.  What about 3 cheaper players from Minnesota? I’m sure that would’ve been more value. Honestly Wiggins isn’t better than your average player. Grabbing three average players in a trade for D Lo would have added depth."
"Cmon dude. You have a Curry and a Draymond on a team right now vying for a play-in spot while Durant is on a team not unlikely appearing like the defacto favorites to win a title this year, and you’re here calling Durant an upgraded Harrison Barnes when the former averaged 25/6/6 playing for the Warriors and was clutch in the playoffs while Barnes averaged 10/5/2 on incredibly worse shooting efficiency while being an outright liability in the Finals. There’s contentious opinions, and then there’s unhealthy delusion."
"To me, it's obvious that in the Warriors title runs, the order of importance goes Curry, Draymond, Klay. Durant doesn't make the top 3. He missed the first title, and when he got to Oakland, he got to play as an upgraded Harrison Barnes. Heck, since the warriors were top defensive teams, one could argue that Iggy had a bigger role than Durant in defining that team's on-court identity.   But KD's prior reputation and scoring titles had a huge set of non-local fans thinking he's the core of the team"
Harrison Barnes is a very intelligent man.  That doesn’t necessarily translate to basketball.
Everyone wrote off Harrison Barnes after the 2016 Finals. Literally scapegoated as the 4th or 5th option.
"Simple, because I'm a Phoenix Suns fan and I expect the worst.   (By the way, we beat the defending champs with Lebron playing and an ejected Devin Booker, so it's not like it's completely hopeless. And that same ""fully healthy"" Lakers team lost to a Sacramento Kings team without De'Aaron Fox or Harrison Barnes, so calm down a little bit on your hype-up of them.)"
Best case: Cj for Tobias harris.  Roco+ DJJ + Pick for Harrison barnes.  Sign a back up guard like Patty Mills.  Sign a back up big like Nerlens Noel.  Resign Powell and Melo.  Our lineup would look like this:  PG: dame/Mills  SG:Norm/Ant  SF: Barnes/Nas  PF:Harris/Melo  C: Nurkic/Noel/Collins
"The role playing core in 19’ was much weaker than 18. We saw the Warriors play some of their best basketball from game 5 in the rockets series to the finals, didn’t really struggle at all. Those 2nd half’s against portland was their go to offense. Warriors success was predicated on their movement, shooting, unselfishness, etc. That’s what won them a championship prior and became the most dominant regular season team of all time. KD replaced Harrison Barnes which is such a big difference, and he offered more options to what the warriors already have but their historic offense revolved around curry not durant"
"Oh man, the warriors fans HATED Lacob for trading Monta Ellis because they didn't trust Steph to be able to handle the offense or to stay healthy. [Bleacher Report as well as others](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1103639-warriors-bucks-trade-winners-and-losers-in-monta-ellis-andrew-bogut-deal) graded the warriors as losers in the trade. Little did they know that would open the team up to Curry, get them the big center they needed to spread the floor, and allow them to drop in seeding down to #7 to protect their draft pick where they selected Harrison Barnes. It was, ultimately the first move to make the Warriors a championship team, and they drafted defensive players in the draft after (Klay and Dray) that cemented them as elite in large part to address the defensive problems they had when Ellis was on the squad.  Lacob got booed in Oakland after. Did he maximize Ellis' value at the time? No, definitely not. But do any warriors fans care now? Hell no"
"It sucked ass but the lack of expectations made the fandom fun. R/sixers was a really fun sub back then and every win was hype. The aftermath of a sixers win was so fun back then. Teams would basically reconsider everything it was hilarious. The part that sucked was Embiid having a setback, Simmons breaking his foot, Markelle fultz's jumpshot etc.. it was fun to watch players develop and improve and the teams tended to have athletic monsters who could deliver highlights. I still think that the sixers almost 25 point comeback against the 73 win warriors was the most fun I have ever had watching a game. I didnt care that we lost to a Harrison Barnes game winner.  Basically it was fun because the season was a wash and we were waiting for Embiid anyway and I just turned games off if they got too shitty. I wasn't committed to each game as it didn't matter. Wins were fun and losses contributed to a high draft pick."
"This team is doing what Dallas tried to do for years: maintain relevance by building around declining stars, play the FA game and end up with Harrison Barnes as your best player. They did that for six years before finally letting go and drafting Luka. I wouldn’t be surprised if we went longer than that."
Nah Harrison Barnes couldn't
Khris Middleton on the 2016 and 2019 Warriors would be a massive upgrade over Harrison Barnes and especially Alfonzo McKinnie
I believe you are talking about Harrison Barnes who led the Cavs to the 2016 championship
Did you just replace MPJ with Harrison Barnes? Are you trying to actively ruin our future?
If he made 10 mil less he’d be making less than Harrison Barnes
"Warriors fan chiming in.  It seems like Wiggins just floats in and out of the game at times.  I feel like he almost forgets he’s a freak athlete and can go get a basket at any point in the game.  Sometimes we need that mentality especially when Curry is off the floor.  Other than that, dude has a great skill set and would be a great 3rd or 4th option.    Problem is with the Klay injury, he’s been forced to lead us when Curry is struggling or on the bench, and like I said, he floats in and out in terms of aggressiveness.  Reminds me sort of Harrison Barnes when he was on the dubs"
Who would have guessed having Durant or klay taking the Harrison Barnes shots would have worked out well?
"In terms of comparing him with previous warriors players, he's like a mix of Harrison Barnes/Andre Igoudala except Maple Jordan credentials ofc. Obviously not up to the hype, but if he'd be on a cheaper contract, get this man on my team anytime (mavs bruv)"
"The Warriors didn't need KD. They went to game 7 even with Curry playing on a sprained MCL, fouling out of game 6 on tick tack fouls, Draymond getting suspended, and Bogut getting injured. To win all they needed was to stay healthy and sign an upgrade over Harrison Barnes (him scoring like 15 total points in the last 3 games of the finals and bricking a ton of shots also contributed heavily to the loss). They just ended up getting the best possible upgrade ever. They could have just gotten Horford or Hayward or another good player like that who was available at the time and done the same thing."
"The Steph lead warriors beat the KD led Thunder. KD is the one that went missing games 5,6,7 to close out the warriors. Did they both need each other? Sure, but this heavily favors Steph more than KD imo. If I could swap out Harrison Barnes for KD I’d be a fool to not try."
"In reality yes, Brooklyn this year is probably better than GS + Harden would be but joining the team that just calmed down from being a dynasty, and also being the same team that Harden couldnt get past in the Western playoffs wouldn’t bode well to most fans. And honestly, if GS was completely healthy, I dont think Brooklyn has much more talent... people forget Steph, Klay and Dray won a title with Harrison Barnes as their fourth guy... granted they had a very good bench with well defined roles but Harden would still be a huge plus over Barnes"
No idea how you are grouping Harrison Barnes with dudes that are barely on NBA rosters.
I’ve watched Harrison Barnes in HS.  Harrison Barnes might have been the very same skill he was in HS as he is now.  Just goes to show how early some players peak.  The #1 player in the country is pretty much an NBA player playing in Highschool.
"Yeah he was *really* good in high school, one of the top 2-3 players in the country. It wasn’t like he was a meh player, I actually was a little surprised at how his pro career panned out given how dominant he was. But it happens a lot. Harrison Barnes and Harry Giles are 2 other guys that immediately come to mind."
"C, why does Team Warriors have Harrison Barnes and Shaq tho"
"That Thunder team had a way worse roster around KD than the Warriors did around Steph and the Thunder still nearly beat them. If you put Westbrook and KD on the warriors, and put Steph and Harrison Barnes on the Thunder, GS destroys OKC."
"they didn’t add to each others games and they still won 2 championships and went to four finals, so uhh yeah that kinda proves my point  anthony davis + role players is much more talented than the combo they got rid of  and kd was better than harrison barnes so, yeah the team got better with him, obviously  also thats literally what i said, talent is king and fit brings teams over the top"
"Harrison Barnes, franchise combo forward for the Mavs before we even drafted DSJ"
Harrison Barnes immediately looking like a puppet that had its strings cut after that shot is the definition of demoralizing
Not as bad as harrison barnes that one year
"When the Warriors were great, they also had great role players. Iguodola, Livingston, Barbosa, Bogut, Looney (at times), Harrison Barnes (at times), to name a few. Klay will surely regress after missing two years with injuries. Draymond is not quite the player he was three years ago. Steph is still great, but I don't see them having enough talent to make the finals."
"Mark Jackson thought Harrison Barnes was possessed by a demon, and healed Stephs ankle with prayer and magic oil. Probably shouldn’t be a coach either"
"Look up Cam's advanced stats his last year. His shooting splits were elite no need to discuss that.  He trounces Jackson, Barnes, and Ellington in OBPM. Advanced metrics was not tracked during McCants' time so I can't compare to him. I also believe Cam was third behind Clarke and Zion in NCAA OBPM ranking that season. His impact on the offensive end was ridiculous, UNC had a good shot to the final four had he been healthy against Auburn. If you include DBPM to look at overall BPM he is much more impactful box score wise than those three aforementioned.   The only wing player who comes close to Cam's impact in college was Danny Green thanks to his elite defense since his freshman year. Of course Danny wasn't better than Hansbrough or Lawson but he was third best on the team.  https://barttorvik.com/playerstat.php?year=2009&amp;p=Danny%20Green&amp;t=North%20Carolina  Look at these advanced metrics and ask yourself how the hell someone averaging 12.7/4.6/2.7, 1.8 steals, 1.3 blocks shooting 47.1/41.8/85.2 gets drafted in the middle of the second round.  [Cameron's for comparison](https://barttorvik.com/playerstat.php?year=2019&amp;p=Cameron%20Johnson&amp;t=North%20Carolina)  If you want disappointment look at Harrison Barnes' page."
Is he essentially a 2016 Harrison Barnes level player or nah?
"He's probably a little worse than Tobias Harris and a little better than Harrison Barnes, and both of those guys are well compensated"
Wiggins will be alright. He'll fill the Harrison Barnes role from their first championship team once Klay comes back but I am not sure that is enough to win a ring this time.
"He's basically Harrison Barnes, contracts and all"
"They got extremely ""lucky"" to build that team in the first place, Curry's ankles and him getting a discount contract, Klay and Dray on rookie deals, cap spike to get Durant and Harrison Barnes rejects a contract   That allowed them insane depth for the first title and 2016 which is what made them that great, then with KD that went away because they had to pay their stars   A lot of things fell in the right place at the right time, which you can say for a lot of teams but Warriors just got a lot of good fortune, obviously they did a great job as well"
"If you are asking about the Harrison Barnes pick it was pretty clear that we weren't coming near the playoffs.      We are commenting on this video where the grizzlies got technicals because they were \*mad\* about \*losing.\*     Pretty significant difference.      For reference, I've rooted for all the OG Oakland teams since 95.  And I made my reddit account to explain the analytics of the Bogut-Monta Ellis trade since our fanbase was acting irrational about it."
i think he can still be making upwards of 15 mil a year. similar to Harrison Barnes
"Wiggins is very much poised to be the Harrison Barnes of this team. Real solid defensively, somewhat inconsistent shot but capable offensively, slightly to moderately worse rebounding but a better shot blocker. More athletic but probably not quite as strong. He made Ingram's game rough."
Isn’t Erman the assistant coach who tried to record Mark Jackson performing an exorcism of Harrison Barnes?
Harrison Barnes definitely the MVP
"Thanks for the context and all, and it's perfect valid, but we just got rocked by a Kings team without DeAaron Fox and Harrison Barnes and a Raps team without OG, FVV and Gary Trent Jr. You still had the MVP, Gordon and MPJ. We'll take the W however we can get them at this rate lol"
"Buddy Hield, Harrison Barnes, and Richaun Holmes are all better than whoever OKC is rolling out unless Dort plays."
Without De’Aaron Fox and Harrison Barnes 😂😂😂
Wiggins contract isn't great.    Harrison Barnes looking like an overpay.
"Marvin Bagley, Harrison Barnes, and Delon Wright all have the Mavs circled on the calendar"
"Not exactly the answer to your question, but...  Of the past 100 top 10 draft picks ( 2009-2019 draftees ), the only 5 to even reach the Finals with their draft team are: Harrison Barnes, Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, James Harden, and Stephen Curry. And two of those wouldn't have made it without a certain free-agent acquisition.  The preceding decade was just a little better, with 7 out of 100: Westbrook, Durant, Bynum, Howard, Wade, Kenyon Martin, and Paul Pierce.  Of those 12 players, only 5 were top 3 picks and just 3 were first overall -- over 20 years.  So while building a winner high in the draft is a nice idea, its recent track record is bleak, at best."
Didn't the Warriors tank hard in 2011-12 to keep Utah from getting the draft pick that ended up being Harrison Barnes?
"OK, several points.   One, no need to be pedantic. Regardless of Draymond's exact role in the team at the point of their initial sixth seed my point is who on OKC is going to be the eventual Draymond? That's the comparison. A team ascending vs. a team descending.   Second, yes he was. He played 72 games in that season.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draymond_Green  I mean for fuck's sake.   &gt;In Game 1 of the first round of the 2013 playoffs against the Denver Nuggets on April 20, Nuggets' guard Andre Miller drove around Green and made the game-winning layup in the Nuggets' 97–95 win over the Warriors. Improving on his three-point percentage and offensive performance over the course of the series, Green helped the Warriors win the first round in six games.  Third, this is a direct quote from the Wikipedia entry I linked in my first response.  &gt;The Warriors had four draft picks in the 2012 NBA Draft, a decisive draft year that was vital for a potential future for the team. The picks included Harrison Barnes with the 7th pick, Festus Ezeli with the 30th pick, Draymond Green with the 35th pick, and Ognjen Kuzmic with the 52nd pick  Please note second to last GS pick, number 35 overall, DRAYMOND GREEN.   So, not only were you being pedantic, you were wrong."
Remember when they won a championship without KD and with Harrison Barnes?
"Considering he has two finals MVPs and if you didn’t have him, you’d probably have Harrison Barnes instead, I’ll beg to differ.  There’s a reason Curry has never come close to sniffing a finals MVP trophy. He wilts when the finals come."
"As a Mavs fan, going from Dirk to Luka is an unfair transition.   Before we traded up to get him, the discussion on /r/Mavericks were like “Dennis Smith Jr, Harrison Barnes, and Mo Bamba would be a solid core, right?”"
"The Warriors tanked their ass off the year they got Harrison Barnes in the draft (the year of the Monta/Bogut trade if I'm not mistaken), they basically sat everyone in the second part of the season, all their games were complete jokes post all star game"
Harrison Barnes came back and made up for all the bricks in 2016
"yes, Harrison Barnes showed the legal play several days ago: first, make the shot, then pat on the butt.  Not the other way around."
"Yes, I would trade Harrison Barnes for Ben Simmons. I'd also buy a Barnes Sixers uniform."
"Also guys like Jae Crowder, Nance, Cam Johnson, Thad Young, Harrison Barnes."
"The problem is he allowed his GM to suddenly hire Luke without interviewing anyone else. Basically after the Lakers fired Luke, it was all but a formality for Vlade to sign him, and Vivek allowed that to happen despite coaches such as Messina (who wanted the job btw), Monty Williams, and others being available.  Open his checkbook you say? It's in his regime that we (1) traded IT for cash considerations and Alex Oriakhi instead of resigning him after a 20ppg season (2) traded Boogie instead of giving him the supermax (which in hindsight worked out well but for unfortunate reasons), (3) lost Bogdan for nothing after promising him that the team would ""run it back"" and give him an extension. And when he did open his checkbook, it's to give vets overpriced contracts (Hill, Joseph, Dedmon, etc), to pay for coaches that have been fired, and to overpay Buddy Hield and Harrison Barnes (to some extent).  I can't fault him for wanting to bring out a winning team, but the problem is he ""believes"" that this team is capable of making the playoffs in each of his years here, hence the making of short-sighted moves to ""win now"". The only year I had hope we'd make it was Joerger's final year, and he managed to fuck that up by thinking a coach that was giving tough love to his players wasn't worth a pay raise. I'm hoping he gives Monte the chance to tear it all down and start fresh, but if he doesn't, then we're stuck in this ""mid-lottery team that thinks the playoffs is close"" level of play."
"If they can get a more experienced veteran 3 and D and power forward it could potentially spark great things for the Wolves. If they fortunately keep the kick they have to GS, Mobley could even be one of the closing players in those lineups.  I feel like someone like Daniel House, Danny Green, Thad Young, Harrison Barnes, JaMychal Green, etc would be good free agent or trade targets for boosting their defense and experience."
"A bit of context that makes me forgive this somewhat, Drummond was the clear pick in his place after the fact, but that was just a year after Valanciunas had been drafted and all indications were that he would get to the Raptors the coming season, which he did.  The Raptors had some bad luck in a coin toss with Golden State with tied records, which resulted in them getting the pick right before to draft Harrison Barnes, my preferred pick and probably the best fit and talent selection they could have made."
"It would be easier if someone other than LeBron or the Warriors won over the last decade. The Raptors sneaking one against a super-injured Dubs team is the only thing that would keep the champs in it. Imagine if the champs have to go to the well for old-ass Rondo, JaVale McGee, Harrison Barnes, Kevin Love, etc. instead of Kawhi, Siakam, Lowry, FVV, and the option of Norm Powell/OG Anunoby"
Anyone who could've shot better than Harrison Barnes basically
"imagine picking Lonzo Ball, Harrison Barnes, or Buddy Hield when anyone else is available.  this is worse than Kings picking Bagley"
&gt;Obviously hes never been the best player on the court in any finals but he was literally the worst player on the court.  His name isn't Harrison Barnes so that can't be true.
"&gt;For a dude who was injured, he sure did shimmy a lot that entire postseason.  [Kerr admits Curry's injuries forced 'a few adjustments' in Finals](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/kerr-admits-currys-injuries-forced-few-adjustments-finals). Is your argument really that he was 100% healthy because he was able to shimmy? That's one of the dumbest things I've ever heard.  &gt;Also, I love how people just make shit up. ""Lobbied Adam Silver.""  [“The league will take a look at it,” James said. “Obviously our locker room as seen it and we will see what they say.”](https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/06/10/lebron-angling-for-draymond-green-suspension-klay-thompsons-thigh-harrison-barnes-redemption/)   [Cleveland lobbied for a two-game suspension, according to ESPN's Zach Lowe.](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/report-cavs-lobbied-draymond-get-two-game-suspension)"
"It was a collective choke lol Harrison Barnes was shit and Klay shot 2/10 from 3 in game 7. In fact, no one other than Dray and Shaun Livingston shot atleast 40% from the field  Lebron meanwhile was the only one that choked in 2011. Wade was amazing and Bosh was good"
Yea so Harrison Barnes and Klay could chuck up more shots and lead the Warriors to a blowout loss instead of a close one
"Live by the 3, ~~die by the 3~~ lost to the the Kangz when Harrison Barnes was injured midgame. I want my $120 back T.T"
"Well we havent seen Klay actually be the leader of his team and the primary offensive player so its a bit unfair to assume he wouldnt be good at doing it. Same thing with Draymond and yeah I do agree a large part of his offense is because of Curry but he still a great defender. That team also had Iggy who played good, Livingston who played good, and Harrison Barnes who played good. Not all star level or anything but its safe to assume that team will do just fine."
"I'm in my mid-30s and grew up a Sonics fan, I'm not new to the league. The Wolves and Kangz have never tanked properly. Just being incompetent and picking in the 7-10 range every single year isn't tanking. Then when the Kangz do finally land a top 3 pick, they pass up Trae and Luka to pickup Bagley 🤦 They're trying so hard just to make the 8 seed, so they do shit like pickup Harrison Barnes to drag them towards the middle. That's why they are who they are, and we're not doing that.      And we're not resting any promising young guys... SGA is solid, taking 2 months off won't affect him negatively. Dort doesn't need reps right now. We know what we've got there, dude proved himself against James Harden in a game 7. Poku isn't being rested, he's playing 30+ minutes a game. Same with Maledon, Brown, Bazely etc."
"Harrison Barnes putting up some of his best numbers since being traded by Dallas, and even then his efficiency is among his career highs and with more usage. Good to see him show he still has it after being the odd-man out in Durant's GSW saga."
"Average is like 2 miles iirc, and Steph like top 15 out of all players.  Harrison Barnes is first with 2.76 miles per game"
"Probably yes lol, even with Harrison Barnes that’s a top tier team in the league.  The only year Harden pushes them is 2018."
Hopefully Harrison Barnes is okay
"That was pre-injury Klay, a better offensive Draymond, and Harrison Barnes was a 40% 3pt shooter.   I don’t remember my thoughts at the start of 2014 but by the end they proved they were very good   If Wiggins can be a 40% 3pt shooter and Klay doesn’t lose a step offensively or defensively and Draymond improves on offense they can be a contender."
Is Harrison Barnes' nickname not The Senator? I could have sworn people called him that back when he was still on GSW?
"Harrison Barnes gave himself that nickname coming out of high school, comparing himself to Kobe. Maybe the Black Pigeon is more fitting."
They should try and get Harrison Barnes if they can work contracts
"Haha because of Harrison Barnes? Do you think that was a ""gotcha""? Just admit you're uneducated and move on"

So a big expiring contract + Promising rookie + 2 firsts?  Thats a overpay for Harrison Barnes
"Recency bias. I just watched some pre-KD highlights, and Barnes was actually better than I remembered.  It’s been so long, I guess I fell into the typical “blame Harrison Barnes” trap 😅"
"copy pasting,  &amp;#x200B;  I posted  &amp;#x200B;  3 Harrison Barnes Highlights  1 Draymond Highlight  3 Haliburton Highlights  and then 3 Steph lowlights.  &amp;#x200B;  it really isnt my fault you guys chose to ignore everything but to cry about the steph lowlights. he just didnt do anything good in the 4th quarter for me to even highlight. he scored 1 point before they intentionally fouled. what you want me to do? clip him chewing his mouthpiece?"

Luckily 2015 Harrison Barnes showed up
Harrison Barnes and making shots when it counts
it started off as me trying to make tonight harrison barnes night but these assholes kept downvoting him so i took it personally.
*THERE* is the Harrison Barnes I know!
Warriors legend Harrison Barnes
"I probably shouldn't have used Jokic as an example, defense is absolutely critical at the center position. But I didn't want to list a 3rd guard like Dame so I tried to think of a wing or a big lol. You're going to go far in the playoffs if you have a great team, Harrison Barnes' defense was irrelevant for the Warriors. Kevin Love's defense was irrelevant for the Cavs, Kyle Kuzma's defense was irrelevant for the Lakers. One guy being bad on defense doesn't sink your team, it literally doesn't matter as long as the coach can put that guy in a position where he isn't getting attacked on every possession."
"Thinking just about the roster I see some vague personnel parallels (gotta squint really hard tho...)  Seth / Korkmaz / Milton etc. as the shooters (ultra poor-man's splash bros), Tobias Harris as (a better version of?) Harrison Barnes, and Embiid as a much better version of Bogut?"
Harrison Barnes' entire 2016 Finals performance was worse
Harrison Barnes
Niang is giving me Harrison Barnes flashbacks
Biggest factor was Harrison Barnes going 5/32 in the last three games and that will pain me till I die
"He was absolutely ok at his job from 2004-2011 but was absolutely dog shit from 2012 to now.   We can give him a pass for not landing FA it’s hard to do if not on a coast. But some of his trades were beyond bad like Seth curry for Josh Richardson without scooping up something good in return.     Josh johnson who was actually really solid for us and protected Luka on the court for JJ reddick who was legit injured and didn’t even wanna come to Dallas and Niko can’t see the floor bello  in 2021 alone were stupid as hell.   Extending Powell was fine, but the amount of cash they used to do it when he wouldn’t of gotten that much on the open market was stupid.   Signing Harrison Barnes to the max after signing Wes Mathews to a near max was stupid as hell and we should’ve started the tank a year earlier.    Drafting DSJ was whatever we all liked him but we could’ve very easily traded that pick and tanked and gotten Luka and not had to burn an extra first to the hawks.   The only good moves he’s made since 2011 was bringing in Vince Carter, Securing THJ in the Kp trade and. drafting Luka but I think that was a team effort on Luka."
"Not sometimes, all the time. Championships are won by the best team that series and a large part of that is if the role players step up and play well.  Example- Spurs against the Heat: Green went nuclear the whole series and all the Spurs role players played very well while LeBron was the only one on the Heat who seemed to be able to do anything.  Example- Cavs against the Warriors 2016: JR Smith made some incredible plays during game 7 (and throughout the entire playoffs) to the point where they wouldn't have won without him. Harrison Barnes played awful this series and was a big reason the Cavs were able to stay in and win games. If Barnes plays like his normal self the Cavs probably don't win."
Irving and Love vs Klay and Harrison Barnes
Yeah looking at the roster the only player that’s an all star IMO was a 22 year Donovan Mitchell. Harrison Barnes was a starter on that team.
"Harrison Barnes has a ring, you take that back"
White Harrison Barnes lmao
"reminds me of harrison barnes; damn, when it gets mental, seems hard to snap out of it."
"damn, was painful watching him. He plays scared now; reminds me of harrison barnes in the finals. But harris is a much better 3pt shooter.   Hope he gets his mind straight. The other game was 1-11, and 2-11 this game."
"I've learned from this thread that Giannis is trash so I'd like to see him get traded for Harrison Barnes, straight up. I think that'd be fair."
Joe Harrison Barnes
"Harris ""Harrison Barnes"" for 3 - AIRBALL"
Harris is pulling a Harrison Barnes level cold streak
"I hope he does. He didn’t make it in 2012 and then injured in 2016. Want him to get that Gold Medal. Klay, Dray, KD, and Harrison Barnes all got one last time and Iggy did in 2012"
"They would not have a championship with Mark Jackson. This is the same fucking dude who kept calling for Harrison Barnes post ups in crunch time when he had the two of the greatest shooters of all time. Also the same dude who isolated players on his team for not being ""religious enough"" and kept preaching about heart, soul and effort over what the actual gameplan was.  There's a reason he got fired despite having a good record. Warriors fans will tell you if you ask them."
Harrison Barnes regressed with Kerr though. Warriors had a pretty easy path to finals that year. I’ll die on hill saying if lob city doesn’t blow 3-1 lead they beat warriors and if Kyrie’s healthy Curry would have 0 championships in his career
I still have nightmares about Harrison Barnes post ups.
"Don’t think so, that would be Larry Riley. Schlenk poached Larry Riley from the Warriors and now he’s an advisor for the Hawks. Riley was the GM that drafted both Steph and Klay. Riley was director of scouting for the Warriors when they drafted Draymond and Harrison Barnes."
"Yeah, either the Lakers sign him for big dollars or they let him walk.    Them letting him walk screws them more than it screws him.    It’s the same reason that the Warriors were about to sign Harrison Barnes to a max contact after the 2016 NBA finals before KD jumped ship over to them.    They had to pay him whatever he wanted because they’d be much worse off without him regardless of whether he shit the bed in the playoffs or not."
I said im their right mind. Harrison Barnes and being sane isn't exactly a true combination.
Harrison Barnes
Don't forget trading Harrison Barnes mid-game
"That’s exactly what I hate about coaching comparisons. On the Ty Lue thread the other day people were saying “Of course Lue is a top 5 coach his teams have never finished outside of the top 4 in their conference” completely ignoring the fact that the only teams hes coached had Lebron fucking James and Kawhi/PG.    I like to grade coaches more off their expectations with their given talent rather than just randomly looking at what the end of season results are while ignoring everything else. Teams like the Nets, Bucks, Lakers, Clippers are going to be a playoff contender no matter who is coaching them because their teams are incredibly talented. Give any coach a roster with a starting lineup of Harrison Barnes, Wes Mathews, Yogi Ferrel, Dennis Smith Jr., and a 40 year old Dirk and see how many games they win lol."
We would've won if not for a lot of things in 2016. Steph's MCL injury. Bogut's leg injury. Andre's back injury. Dray being stupid.    Not sure giving Harrison Barnes the max would've gotten us 4 chips in a row though. The Rockets were tough.
"Cavs being considered a superteam is ridiculous. And anyway, Lebron still got to play 2015 finals without Kyrie and Love, so the whole superteam thing, that made zero sense in first place, just wasn't there.  If some people think 2016 Cavs were a superteam, they also have to explain how that version of Love was able to turn that contender into superteam level.  Love during playoffs has been so damn far to all-star level. Even more during the finals when he was as good as harrison barnes."
"Harrison Barnes, 2016 Finals"
"I think it depends on what you mean by 'high'. They were all lottery picks, but none of them were top 3 or even top 5 picks, which is where you expect to get all the top end talent in the draft.  Curry went #7 (semi-controversially) and Klay went 11th. Harrison Barnes is about what you hope your #7 pick will turn out like."
"I don’t think they come close to winning that title without AD. None of them are good enough to be the second best player on a championship team in lebrons window (maybe two more years). AD was. Presuming AD figures out how to stay healthy (doubt) he is the star the next team is built off of.   Those kids the Lakers traded aren’t Steph and Klay. They’re barely Harrison Barnes’.   IMO you are overrating BI,Ball and Hart. They are (currently) not the players to bring you a title."
"With Conley out, you can’t have both Bogdanovic and Clarkson playing subpar, specially the former.   One thing I didn’t like was how O’Neale wasn’t defending Kawhi tightly because of foul trouble.  Well, if he is not playing hard defense then what’s the point of playing at all? It’s not like he’s in the game for his scoring, play-making or rebounding.   Also, down double digits, why the hell was Mitchell slowing things down every time he brought the ball down the court?  The one time it looked like Jazz got into a momentum to cut the lead to a couple of possession Niang pulled an Harrison Barnes."
We’re on a short timeline anyway so that’s a little more tolerable for me. Memphis went into rebuilding mode and he got fired from the Kings for not getting 40 wins (he had 39) despite posting their best record since 05-06.   Those kings teams were awful and had no business even being 30-35 win teams. The best players he had were Boogie for 2/3 of his first season and Harrison Barnes for 1/3 of his 3rd and final season. His second season had 0 players above 15ppg and his highest scorer was 36YO Zach Randolph.  Edit: didn’t see your flair before commenting but too lazy to change some wording..
I mean if we all wanted Harrison Barnes to just spot up and shoot 3s KP is a much better version of that
"Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Harrison Barnes, Draymond Green, Andrew Bogut, Leandro Barbosa, Shaun Livingston, Andre Iguodala, Marreese Speights, Festus Ezeli, Ian Clark, Brandon Rush, James Michael Mcadoo, Kevon Looney, Anderson Varejao  and Jason Thompson who got waived midseason."
"Here's what they each did FWIW.  **Carmelo Anthony**  &gt; Anthony, Chris Paul and Dwyane Wade created the Social Change Fund in July 2020.

Gobert vs morris is the most lob sided duel in the playoffs since prob Bron vs harrison barnes in 2016
PG13 is basically Harrison Barnes with braids and a small forehead
"They left him wide open, he had like 10 feet of space on a short elbow jumper near the end. Harrison barnes treatment. Not sure this will continue though, joe's too good to keep missing this badly."
"Harris sold this game so fucking hard, he did the Harrison Barnes"
"nah that's simply not true, Warriors had a ton of nice pieces around them in Livingston/Iggy/Bogut/Harrison Barnes/David Lee"
"[Andre Iguodala did not regress in 2017](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/andre-iguodala-is-not-an-afterthought/). KD had nearly **3x** as many win shares as Harrison Barnes in 2016, and far more than Speights, Barbosa, Livingston etc combined. The Heat, on the other hand, gave up basically every single player who was on their roster in 2009-2010. It would be more analogous to KD, Steph, and Draymond all joining the Knicks, or LeBron joining the KG/Pierce/Allen Celtics immediately following their 7 game loss in the Finals 2010.   I'm not disputing that LeBron kicked off this wave of forming superteams through free agency or strong-arming trades; that much is obvious and was virtually unprecedented when it happened in 2010. But saying KD did the exact same thing as LeBron, only better (which is what you implied) is pretty dubious."
"&gt; The national basketball team for Yugoslavia if it still existed would be nuts and could 100% take down Team USA.  I think 100% beating Team USA is hyperbolic unless they're playing the same 2019 roster, in this hypothetical scenario, which included: Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Joe Harris, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Donovan Mitchell, Mason Plumlee, Marcus Smart, Jayson Tatum, Myles Turner, Kemba Walker, Derrick White.  That being said, a Yugoslavian team would wreck shop."
"The gap between the team the US put out two years ago and its best team is massive. If the US actually sent their best players, you're looking at something like:  Steph curry, LeBron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, Draymond Green, and DeAndre Ayton.   The team that they actually sent was:  Marcus smart, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen brown, Harrison Barnes, Derrick white, Mason plumlee, Khris Middleton, Kemba walker, Joe Harris, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, and Donovan Mitchell."
"Huh? How does starting Smart ruin our forward framework? We obviously need to add size to this team, which is why I’m not giving you names of point guards to add. I don’t want to invest in point guard. I don’t want to invest in Kemba Walker. I am good with a Smart, Brown, Tatum backcourt and adding size instead. I can give you almost a dozen names of players with size, because unlike point guard, that’s something I’m interested in adding… Larry Nance Jr, Al Horford, Kristaps Porzingis, Harrison Barnes, Marcus Morris, Christian Wood, Myles Turner, Thad Young, Kyle Anderson."
"It’s pathetic how you have to explain this to him. Not only did he prevent LeBron from roaming freely like he did when Harrison Barnes was on the court, but KD had the impact of that of a #1 wide receiver in football in that the Cavs assigned their best defender on him at all times, which when it was LeBron ensured that he couldn’t offer the same help defense that he had done in 2016.  And there’s statistics out there proving that Curry had more wide open shots than KD did that entire series (https://twitter.com/njkid3/status/1389662664167723010 ).  People just like to go back to that gif in Game 1 where the Cavs played poor transition defense and like to apply it to the entire series, as if KD’s only buckets in the 2017 Finals came from fastbreak situations where the Cavs protected the perimeter instead of the paint.  Steph’s finals numbers in 2019 looking more in line with what they did in 2016, should show you that their relationship was symbiotic, and that Curry wasn’t facing all these mysterious double and triple teams while the defense was just leaving KD wide open like he was Tony Allen (as if they couldn’t just help off of Draymond’s man)."
Harrison Barnes is still a huge upgrade over Thomas Robinson
"Ironically, at least half the comments on that workout said to not draft Dame. One basketball genius even suggested drafting Harrison Barnes then running Point Tyreke Evans."
"I don't think Dame was an obvious pick at all at the time. I don't know who was watching Weber State games to have been really hype on him. Like, I remember him getting a bit of buzz, but this was a pretty weak draft class, and there were plenty of weak players picked ahead of him. AD was the clear #1, but then you have the next tier of Kidd-Gilchrist, Beal, Dion Waiters, and Thomas Robinson picked ahead of him. I remember being much more aware of Harrison Barnes, Andre Drummond, and Austin Rivers ahead of the draft. Those were the can't miss, 5 star high school players with the Hoops Mixtapes Youtube videos that me and my friends were passing around."
I think he’s a good fit. He’s no worse than Harrison Barnes was on the 73-win team. Obviously completely different context but I just mean he can be a reliable defender and adequate shooter when he needs to be. That’s what Klay and Steph need around them!
"In all seriousness, I know Minny fans have a bad opinion of him but if he keeps growing like he did last year and the Warriors are an actual playoff team, I can see it.   That said, I know the man has a rep for being inconsistent, so I'll settle for an upper-middle class man's Harrison Barnes."
"He fits like Harrison Barnes did, just needs a cheaper contract"
"https://www.nba.com/stats/players/speed-distance/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=DIST_MILES_DEF&amp;dir=1  He led most of the season, fell behind Harrison Barnes late, but yea he had the second most ground per game on defense. Absolute joke."
"draymond was the 2012 35th pick, not too shabby.  (they also had harrison barnes #7, festus ezeli #30, and ognjen kuzmic #52 that year.)"
"He plays the Harrison Barnes role well. With Klay and Steph back defenses will be focused on them, hopefully giving Wigs some easy buckets. He's also a decent iso defender and can switch onto most players.  Not sure there's someone better they can get in return in a trade."
"Fine. Remove KD from the Nets and give them Harrison Barnes, Bogut and one or two other pieces. They’re not going 73-9.  Steph, Klay, Dray, Igoudala &gt; Harden, Kyrie, Joe Harris, Blake  The Nets team isn’t as well built as the KD Warriors were."
Yes and the Warriors had Harrison Barnes amongst a whole host of other pieces they had to get rid of to make space for KD.  This Warriors went 73-9 and added KD argument is so lazy.
First few games were tough because the Cavs offense was out of sorts when the Warriors would just switch pick n rolls with Draymond. Took a few games for Lebron &amp; Kyrie to just target Steph and Harrison Barnes and dominate 1v1
"Can you name anyone KD made better?  Again, GS was winning 73 games &amp; a championship with Harrison Barnes, let me repeat that HARRISON BARNES.  Westbrook is going down as a HOF player btw &amp; KD was his sidekick."
"Duncan by far, KD can never ever reach him.    Duncan made his teammates better, KD on the other hand played with dudes that were already established.  GS was winning a ring &amp; 73 games with Harrison Barnes in Durants place lol"
"They won A ring, singular, against the Cavs missing their two best players with Harrison Barnes.   They were crying in the parking lot when they faced a fully loaded Cavs team."
"Duncan was the Spurs best defender &amp; offensive player everything fell on him, KD wasn't even better than Draymond or Iguodala defensively on his own team.  And just about any star's defense will improve dramatically when they're not the main guy scoring.  The dubs were winning rings with Harrison Barnes in KDs place lol."
"A user on the Warriors subreddit typed out a list of all the crazy shit he did when he was with the Warriors, I wish I could give them credit but they deleted their account.  •Staged a coup of John Stockton while he was on the Jazz, causing Stockton to retire.  •Cheated on his wife with a stripper, then getting blackmailed by the prostitute + some other guy, while at the same time being a born-again pastor  •Bristled at Mike Malone being the assistant coach under him (ownership wanted him to be the Associate Head Coach, like Gentry was with Kerr, but when Jackson found out he said NO WAY  •Didn't let assistant coaches do interviews with press because he thought they were gunning for his job  •Pushed Malone out because Jackson thought Malone was gunning for his job  •Ran ISO-ball all the time  •Instilled a ""us vs them"" where the ""them"" was the entire front office. He would tell the players that the front office didn't want them to win so that Mark Jackson would look bad. C'mon that's lunacy  •Barred Jerry West and Jim Barnett (the beloved TV color guy) along with everyone else from practices so they couldn't hear the crazy s*** he said to the team  •Told the team Ezeli was rooting for them to lose so that Ezeli would look better (he was injured). This culminated in Ezeli in tears saying that there was no way he would do this, when confronted by the team  •Told the team that Harrison Barnes was possessed by a demon, which is why he regressed  •Darren Erman, the assistant responsible for the defense after Mike Malone left, was recording Mark Jackson surreptitiously to try and capture the crazy s*** like the Harrison Barnes demon thing and the Ezeli thing, but was caught and fired  •Noted homophobe, including the ""I'll pray for him"" when discussing Jason Collins coming out. This doesn't fly in the bay area when a lot of the team staff is gay and so is the front office, including the COO/President Rick Welts  •Didn't want to hire actual good assistants, instead, he hired yes-men like Pete Myers and Lindsay Hunter, who backstabbed Alvin Gentry in Phoenix to get the head job  •All the coaching staff were allying themselves with star players instead of the players who actually needed their help/development, so a lot players like Barnes didn't get the development time and help they needed  •He put players against each other, telling a star player ""hey that bench thinks he's better than you"" and then telling the bench guy ""hey that star guy thinks you're s***, go take his job""  •Didn't get along with anyone in the front office, including Jerry West, Bob Myers, and actually the rest of the employees (marketing, PR, etc)  •No preparation. He said in the Clippers series that he didn't need to prepare extra hours, when Doc Rivers was up all night devising schemes"
PTSD flashbacks of Harrison Barnes in the post
2019 only looked decent on paper but everyone acknowledges there were big flaws.  Super young team and Harrison Barnes was the only former olympian.  Kemba was legitimately considered the best player going in. Tatum/Jaylen/Mitchell were all 22 and under.
"Mikal is such a luxury, like rich man's Harrison Barnes on the Warriors"
Harrison Barnes is possessed
"this team had a coach who made kanter and melo (2 players that were either out of the league or were given away for free) major rotation players. 20+ minutes a night for each of em. That more than anything sank this team since they're so awful on defense and they had a coach who was committed to playing them, which created an accountability problem (if you were to watch nurk's post game session, this was obvious).  Keeping a core of Nurk/RoCo/Norman/Dame (and hopefully trading CJ + FRP's for a SF of some sort) is really nice. Zach Collins/Nassir Little/Derrick Jones Jr/Anfernee Simons are much better options to come off the bench than guys like Melo/Kanter, who just brick your entire team.  The org just needs to get this coaching hire correct, re-sign Norm and find a decent trade package for CJ (doesn't need to be a star, just need a better fit - like a Harrison Barnes type). And obviously move on from Kanter and Melo (who are FA's).   I just don't understand why it's so hard to picture fixing Portland."
"The only time in Melo's career I've really thought of him positively as a real winner and top tier guy was when he was tearing shit up and carried an otherwise ice-cold US team in the Olympics (don't remember the game or the year). I still think lesser of him than most probably do, but that helped his legacy in my mind. The Olympics may not turn Harrison Barnes into a hall of famer but they do have some sway on legacy. It's also cool to root for guys you normally root against because 'Murka."
"  DeAndre Jordan , George Hill , Jusuf Nurkic, Serge Ibaka, Pat Beverly, Montrezl Harrell ,  Steven Adams, Ricky Rubio, TJ Warren , Jeremy Lamb, Kevin Love, Thad Young,, Al Farouq Aminu, Tomas Satoransky, Gary Harris, Terrace Ross, Danillo Gallinari, Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, Terry Rozier, Harrison Barnes, Al Horford."
Basically Harrison Barnes when he played for the Mavs. Just gotta keep your stat line looking pretty so you have trade value and help a bunch of younger dudes learn the ropes in a low-stakes environment while still losing most of your games to get a good draft pick.  KP could be a perfect fit for the job. He'll be great in Orlando/Cleveland/Charlotte/OKC/Chicago/Houston.
"Harrison Barnes had a complete meltdown those last three games. If he would have connected in just one of those games and the Warriors won that championship, Kevin Durant would have never ended up in Golden State that off season."
Yeah if you told someone Lebron Kyrie and K Love beat Steph Klay and Draymond in a game 7 literally no one would say that’s even remotely close to the biggest upset in history. Basketball fans always talk about the how different the playoffs are and how the regular season doesn’t matter. With that series they ignore all that because the Warriors won 73 games. When you look at the fact that Andy V and Festus were getting significant minutes down the stretch it’s really not that surprising they lost. Especially given Curry was a month removed from a MCL strain and Harrison Barnes couldn’t hit the side of a barn.
Honestly I don't think the Olympics matter at all for legacy if you're on a stacked US team. I don't think of Harrison Barnes or Deandre Jordan any differently because they happen to have gold medals.
I think Kemba would be good in Dallas Idk if the Cs do this. Love and Sexton for KP and Brunson or KP/ Brunson for Harrison Barnes and Bagley
To this day I do not understand why Harrison Barnes was on the Olympic team
"You do realise Team USA brought Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker, Harrison Barnes, Myles Turner, and Khris Middleton to the 2019 World Cup and still finished seventh, right?"
"I would love to see Harrison Barnes on this team with Steph and Draymond.   Also, in general these lists are light on shooters. So Steph and Lillard would be great but Duncan Robinson would be good for this reason. Tatum, as well."
Yeah but its that stupid mentality that keeps us from getting a decent 2nd/3rd player that we need. Honestly look we moved Harrison Barnes after the KP trade legitimately because we thought we could clear cap for a better player. The REALITY is that was a dumb as fuck move and Barnes would have literally been the perfect fit for us to have an iso guy that gets buckets to help take the load off Doncic.
"&gt; Luka Doncic is r/NBA’s golden boy. He can do no wrong. He takes 7 inefficient step-back threes a game, stat pads triple doubles, shoots tons of free throws and yells about foul calls. To r/NBA this makes him “a stud” and “built different.” They love him unconditionally. Meanwhile, James Harden plays this same style of basketball. Everything I just said to describe Luka’s play could be said about Harden equally. They must love him too, then… right? If you’re familiar with nbacirclejerk (which I assume you are if you’re reading this) then you might have an idea of what’s coming here. In my research I found a few recent (within the year) instances of r/NBA users claiming the Rockets could only beat teams using the refs. Going further back into the sub, there’s lots of people in game threads, post game threads, etc. calling Harden a “flopper” a “chucker” a “bitch” and a “choker.” I even found two comments that said “I hate [Harden] as a person.” (It’s odd to me how r/NBA seems to assume they know players on a personal level, but that’s a topic I’ve covered in previous posts.) Harden clearly gets different treatment from r/NBA than Doncic, despite the two of them playing eerily similar ways, and acting relatively the same in regards to foul calls. So what’s different between the two of them to cause this? Is it the team they play for? The Rockets don’t seem to be particularly well liked, but the Mavericks do recently. So that’s it, problem solved right? No. As one person in r/NBA puts it, “the Mavs didn’t have this many fans when Harrison Barnes was their best player.” r/NBA doesn’t have any deep spiritual connection with the Mavericks that causes them to love all their players. So why is Doncic so loved and Harden so hated? **Well, to be quite frank, Doncic is white**. It has to be said that r/NBA loves white players. The only example of a caucasian player being disliked in r/NBA that I could find in my research was Grayson Allen. People love players like Alex Caruso, and say he’s a top 20 shooting guard in the league, while his teammates who are also shooting guards are ignored or hated, like Avery Bradley and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope respectively. I would rank both of those players above Caruso in terms of talent and impact for the Lakers, but only one of those three players is given universal praise on r/NBA."
"If Harrison Barnes can be in Team USA, I see no reason why Randle can't lol."
Buddy Shield and Harrison Barnes for Porzingis?
porzingis for richaun holmes and harrison barnes
"Yeah, but in how many of those years were they relevant? They tried filling out their roster with Monta Ellis and Harrison Barnes and Chandler Parsons. Their roster construction hasn't been great, and they weren't really expected to win until they landed Luka."
"2011: Won Championship as a severe underdog with case for greatest playoff run oat  2012: Lost to eventual western conference champions OKC  2013: 2nd leading scorer to 34 year old Dirk was OJ Mayo lmao  2014: Took eventual champion Spurs to 7. For context, the Spurs curbstomped the big 3 Heat in 5  2015: Very old Dirk and lost to Rockets who had Harden and Dwight  2016: Lost to prime KD and Russ  2017 &amp; 18: Best player on team was Harrison Barnes rofl  2019: Rookie Luka  2020: KP got hurt and still took Clippers to 6  2021: KP and rest of the team down the stretch played like trash and still took superior Clippers team with home court advantage to 7"
"How would a KP + pick for Richaun Holmes and Harrison Barnes fare for both teams? It’s intriguing for the Kings, since KP can add a different element to the team and likely gets more touches as well. While the Mavs get a solid rim running center and a very good wing that can space the floor but also get his own shot."
"Sometimes, though at others they've been pretty shrewd.  They were right to bet big on Buddy being able to improve despite entering the league as an older prospect.  Also, last few years it seems as though the whole league has wanted Harrison Barnes for little money or a relatively cheap trade, and Sacramento has thus far been pretty on the money in paying him a lot and declining any trade offers for him.  It's not always that they're dumb, just that to me they don't seem to operate according to conventional wisdom."
harrison barnes sucks.
"Steve Kerr took the same team the Warriors had in 2014 to 67-15 and the NBA Championship in 2015. Lue flat out did not outcoach Steve Kerr. Yes, they won the series, but it took a GODLY performance from both Lebron and Kyrie and Harrison Barnes shitting the bed in Games 5-7 for the Cavs to win that championship."
Harrison Barnes prolly
Harrison Barnes averaged 1.3 assists in his final year with the Mavs.
The Harrison Barnes of the Kings is not the same Barnes that played for the Mavs. He was not a playmaker.
You guys specifically traded the one guy that could get his own offense in Harrison Barnes because he took possessions away from Luka.   You can’t have it both ways.
Mavs had a pretty decent passer in Harrison Barnes. But they ran him out of town
Harrison Barnes….lol
Mavs choosing KP over Harrison Barnes has really fucked them hard.
Carlisle deserves blame too. Mavs had a perfect defensive minded PF in Harrison Barnes and Carlisle couldn’t use him properly.
"I was thinking about Grant but with the year he had I think Detroit will commit to him + it doesn't make sense to sign him then flip him for more assets and make your rebuild longer/more difficult.  Harrison Barnes is interesting but that means either he or Norm are the 2nd options which I don't really know if I like? Also, the Kings already have Haliburton and Hield at SG but you could try sending him to a 3rd team. I'll definitely think about that one more"
"It'd be a 3-4 team trade (and I've also tried my hand at coming up with a 4-team trade to satisfy that). And no, you wouldn't be giving up picks in this scenario.   Portland gets: Harrison Barnes  Sacramento gets: Picks from team 3  Team 3 gets: CJ"
"Everybody screams that Dame needs another star next to him and while that's true people are also conveniently forgetting that they just don't have the assets to make that happen.  CJ's a fine player but he's overpaid and needs to be put in a position where he's a primary ballhandler and that really limits his trade value.  I think the best case scenario for keeping Dame happy is trading CJ for a solid (not superstar) 2-way wing and building a **competent** team around him. Yes, it'll lack in star power, but as long as its cohesive and has good defense then that's the best you can do with Dame.  I've been a big proponent of swapping CJ for picks and getting Harrison Barnes back. If you think you can come up with a better trade, I'll be glad to hear it.  But Dame/Norm/Barnes/RoCo/Nurk is a very solid roster. No real weaknesses other than a lack of star power. It still requires Dame to go supernova to get past the first round but hopefully the cohesiveness of that lineup makes up for the shit defense that the current roster has."
"Since Steph and them are already getting one, how about three statues Harrison Barnes, all badly missing wide open mid range jumpshots in the finals"
"Everybody screams that Dame needs another star next to him and while that's true people are also conveniently forgetting that they just don't have the assets to make that happen.  CJ's a fine player but he's overpaid and needs to be put in a position where he's a primary ballhandler and that really limits his trade value.

"&gt;Honestly, they just needed Harrison Barnes to remember he was a professional basketball player in the playoffs.  I think probably the craziest thing about that was that Harrison Barnes was 24. And, like, *barely* 24 - the Finals started 20 days after his birthday.  That's gotta be rough on a young player to be the scapegoat when your MVP shot 4-14 from 3 in game 7, your centers combined for 0-5, 1 point, and 0 rebounds, the second greatest 3 pt shooter went 2-10, and you're the one who gets blamed."
"Everything you said = 1000% true. I fully believe. Kobe was a menace that year. First year I got to watch most the games cause I broke my wrist and was out of HS b-ball. Shit was amazing to watch. Was at the game against the warriors in April.... amazing game. Kobe had 34 and carried with a couple sick 3s over Harrison Barnes. The night before my family and I watched Kobe play all 48 against Portland in Portland, in an LA bar. My first time in LA and holy shit the place was going nuts. It was insane. Kobe 2013 is something I’ll always remember and yes your hypothesis is 1000% correct. They would’ve won the title. They were 28-5(?) after the all star break if I remember correctly. Before the injury. Such a crazy season for Kobe. RIP."
Ricky Rubio on a contender  Ben Simmons in Minny  Indiana moving off one of their bigs  Sacramento trading Harrison Barnes
&gt;	I want nothing more in life than for the original big 3 on the warriors to win a ring next year so all the haters/KD stans stfu  They went ahead and did it before Durant even arrived whiling winning 73 games the next year. They never needed Durant. They just needed Curry to be healthy and Harrison Barnes to not shoot 20% on wide open threes and their second best player being suspended   [good content](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GuP6-puSfRs)
KD is a big fan of Harrison Barnes' work
"they won a title with a similar roster, replacing harrison barnes with wiggins is honestly a big upgrade.  so uh yeah"
"Exactly, like didn't Boogie practically have a new coach every season? Crazy how they squandered away a player of his caliber, keep on and Fox won't be far away.  It's like they tried hard enough at times to make a team that MIGHT be good enough to be a first round exit back in the Boogie days with Rondo, Collison, Barnes, Casspi, etc... Trading for Harrison Barnes and Dedmon (though I think the latter was terrible for the Kings at that point) The Kings are just such an odd organization."
Harrison Barnes would be good imo
"If you think about it, the only real difference is Wiggins replacing Harrison Barnes. The big 3 were all younger and better in 2016 than they are now. So if anything, the roster in 2017 minus KD was better than the one they have now (that team did win 73 games and were up 3-1 in the finals lol).   So if they win this year, it'll show they were very capable 2017-19 as well, without KD."
"They needed KD, stop fooling yourself. The 2017 Warriors also didn't only switch Harrison Barnes for Kevin Durant, they also lost a lot of the depth that made them win 73 games in 2016 to begin with (Speights, Bogut, Barbosa, etc.). The Warriors went from one of the best second units in the league to one of the worst, so no, the didn't ""just traded Harrison Barnes for KD"".  The Warriors got exposed in those playoffs. They survived OKC because Russell Westbrook can sometimes be the actual worst and then got hammered three straight games by a team that had more talent in the top than them, they wouldn't have beaten the 2017 Cavs (a much better version of the team that actually won)."
"For the record I'm actually fine with that Turner suggestion - I think Charlotte offered the same thing last year and we said no.   We were obviously interested in moving on from the 2-big issue with us dangling Turner for Gordon Hayward. If that's the direction the FO wants to take then I'm fine with that.   The CJ thing is kind of a reach but I explained it in my post that you didn't read:   ""The idea of Indiana getting CJ though is arguably the weakest point in this trade. This isn't to say that CJ has no value, but it's hard to find a willing taker for a guy who needs to play point guard and makes 30M.   If Indiana did swap out Sabonis, they'd probably look to get another All-Star level talent back and CJ would fit that bill. There's also a subsection of Pacers fans that don't think Brogdon is meant to be a true point guard and having another ball handler in CJ could be enough to appease them.""  See my comment below on why I'm suggesting Harrison Barnes to Portland. And obviously if Sacramento is trading Barnes they'd want value in return. The idea is that all parties are satisfied with the trades (see bold headers in my write-up for the TLDR)"
"The last 10 drafts below. Out of 20 picks, only Jamal Murray, Bam Adebayo, MPJ and Julius Randle are on the level of Pascal and you could argue he is better than all of them. You are way more likely to get guys like Coby White and Romeo Langford than a Jamal Murray and Bam Adebayo.  7th picks: Killian Hayes, Coby White, Wendall Carter, Lauri Markannen, Jamal Murray, Emmanuel Mudiay, Julius Randle, Ben McLemore, Harrison Barnes, Bismack Biyombo  14th picks: Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, MPJ, Bam Adebayo, Denzel Valentine, Cameron Payne, TJ Warren, Shabazz Muhammad, John Henson, Marcus Morris"
LOL trade cj to get Harrison Barnes.. dame immediately says fk this shit.
Harrison Barnes should not cost two borderline lottery picks.
In what world are we giving up 2 FRPs for Sabonis and the Kings getting 2 FRPs for motherfucking Harrison Barnes? Not gonna read your wall of text there's no way to rationalize this.
"it's funny because among the reasons why KD decided to go to golden state is that the team was going to be clearly better than any other (and they basically were alredy better than any other with harrison barnes playing SF).  So yes, KD is trying his best to validate those 2 rings he got without much issues because let's not forget he was playing with a team that ended up winning a little more than 70% of the games played when KD was out for injury or rest.  In 2017 Warriors vs Cavs rematch without KD would've had still be a close series. Imagine thinking it was even exchanging Harrison Barnes with Kevin Durant. Yeah, Kevin is delusional about this topic and it's not the first time he proves it."
"They need 2 way wings and a 3&amp;D Center. Not a bad defender. Thry need to go after guys like Jerami Grant, Harrison Barnes, Myles Turner"
"Harrison Barnes had declined our offer and proceeded to shit the bed in the finals, you all can thank him for KD joining the Warriors! And I guess the cap jump."
Either LeBron is 10x better than KD or KD is equal to Harrison Barnes. So which is it?
"The Cavs barely beat the Warriors in a 7 game series where they needed a Draymond suspension, Bogut to be injured, and Harrison Barnes to forget how to shoot a basketball. Unless the Cavs got Kawhi/Paul George, they were never going to compete with a Warriors team that just replaced Barnes with KD"
"More likely he thinks Harrison Barnes, andrew bogut, Festivus Ezekiel &gt; KD"
"""Durant thinks Harrison Barnes is on the same level as him""  -ESPN"
"When I hear this shit from KD or Lebron fanboys it’s gets me so heated. People just do not understand how many shitty things had to happen for us to lose that series. Steph was hurt multiple times in the playoffs &amp; had a couple bad games down the stretch, Bogut went out giving more minutes to Festus who got slaughtered in switches, Iggy had a back problem that hampered his play, Dray got suspended for game 5 at home, &amp; Harrison Barnes was historically terrible. If even one of those things goes our way we cap off the best season in nba history and I’d take those back2back rings over the KD ones tbh.   Not to diminish the Cavs title they balled tf out to earn that and we got a ton of breaks the year before, but the idea that we would never get back to a title or beat the Cavs again without KD is absurd"
Harrison Barnes was a god I guess
"I mean if under any circumstances the Cavs win why is what KDs saying so egregious ? The fact is the Cavs needed Draymond suspended, needed Steph banged up and the refs swallowing their whistle (but calling everything the other side), needed Harrison Barnes to miss 2 extra shots, needed Bogut out to get buckets on Varejao and Ezeli.  They deserve all the credit for winning in the end they got it done but all of these things did happen."
Harrison Barnes was the obvious second choice for FMVP in that series for how much he contributed to the Cavs.
The hilarious thing is if Durant thinks it was even in 2017 then he has to think him and Harrison Barnes are comparable
"Yeah but that Cavs playoff run was against a god awful East. And it was essentially the same team that was a Draymond nut kick away from losing to what would have been a back-to-back 73 win championship Warriors team that added the 2nd best player alive and had to give up a washed Bogut and Harrison Barnes?? It was never close on paper, at least imo."
Or that KD thinks that he’s equivalent to Harrison Barnes.
"That's about the best move I could think of honestly - Portland hasn't had a competent 2-way small forward in going on half a decade now.  Flip CJ for picks, throw those picks and some other overpay stuff for Harrison Barnes. That's not a title lock or anything but it's absolutely the most competent squad you can put around Dame."
I guess KD thinks Harrison Barnes is a great basketball player.
"I would like a trade for Harrison Barnes, but we have no draft capital to give Sacramento to close the deal."
"Luka/PG/Harrison Barnes/Julius Randle/Brook Lopez   (I tried to make a semi-realistic team though it’s still a little star-heavy, this team could really punish small ball minus Lopez being a defensive liability when switched into fast guards)"
Why is Harrison Barnes not there
"Tell me he isn’t getting favoritism from the refs without saying how Booker got away with one foul in game 4. Seriously. That was also bad reffing but it only goes to show that the refs were absolutely terrible. So terrible that they accidentally went against the profit center fo the NBA which is Giannis.  Also, when did you stop supporting Harrison Barnes? After he left the choke artist 73-9 Warriors?"
Head Coach: Mike Budenholzer  PG: Eric Bledsoe  SG: DeMar DeRozan  SF: Harrison Barnes  PF: Julius Randle  C: Rudy Gobert
People said the same thing about Harrison Barnes.
"Saying that, there's a big difference between a max player and a RFA getting a max offer sheet. I don't think you'd ever consider Harrison Barnes a max player, despite him getting one. For comparisons sake, I'm pretty sure Wesley Matthews was paid the same as Kanter for at least a couple of years of their deals. The controversy with Kanter was more that our sixth man was completely eliminated from playing any time we played a good P+R player who could shoot and some people who didn't spend all year watching OKC play were confused"
Not in order  1. Love 2. Bledsoe 3. Kemba 4. Gobert 5. John Wall 6. Horford 7. Buddy Hield 8. Harrison Barnes 9. Eric Gordon 10. Joe Harris 11. Steven Adams 12. Davis Bertans 13. Gary Harris 14. Rubio 15. Marcus Morris 16.Terrence Ross 17. Malik Beasley 18. KCP 19. Al-Farouq Aminu 20. DeAndre Jordan
"Jaren Jackson, D'Angelo Russell, Harrison Barnes, Marcus Morris, Austin Rivers and Norman Powell(somewhat) were some that came to mind for me."
"Yeah, the Blazers have done a terrible job of getting talent around Dame and CJ. The Evan Turner contract was an example of something that made no sense to me. You could have signed someone like Harrison Barnes, Al Horford, Boogie, etc."
"This post beat me to a similar idea I was going to post on the Thunder sub, but I agree, no title but comfortably playoffs:  -Trade for Myles Turner  -Try and snipe Simmons or Wiggins in a Dame deal by adding extra picks to POR side of it (hopefully dumping Kemba in the process)  -send the PHX and DEN 1sts to SAC for Harrison Barnes  SGA/Dort/Simmons/Barnes/Turner, with Theo/Poku/Bazley/Kenrich and an MLE-type C should make the playoffs. Swap in Wiggins for Simmons if GSW landed Dame and the ceiling is lower but that’s still a playoff team with a leap from SGA and the young guys"
"Who do the blazers get if you pull fox and the kings picks off? Lol Harrison Barnes and a couple of firsts? It’s just stupid at that point, the kings aren’t getting anything in this trade if they’re not sending out fox.  The whole trade sucks to be honest. Idk why it’s upvoted so heavily."
I don't know how we get Beal but getting him would be a *huge* starting point. Maybe overpay for someone like Harrison Barnes. Dame/Beal/Barnes/Covington/Nurk. To me that's a hell of a squad.
Harrison Barnes shot 6 of 36 over the last 3 games of the finals. The Cavs literally wouldn't even contest his shot.   I appreciate him as a person and everything he did for the team while he was here but that finals performance left a putrid taste in many fan's mouths...
"Is it weird though?  OP was just listing Olympians that have joined without making an all-star appearance. Harrison Barnes makes that list as a matter of fact.  Yes Harrison Barnes is good, however those teams have always been stacked with All-Stars from top to bottom. Barnes is objectively not an All-Star."
"Damian Lillard in september after the blazers just traded cj for marvin bagley and harrison barnes  ""ay yo get me the fuck outta here"""
Harrison Barnes is way better than this sub thinks he is
I’d say Battier but honestly that’s not an indictment on Harrison Barnes. Battier was much further into his career by the time he played this particular role. Not surprising he had a bigger impact.
"Since NBA players joined in 1992, here’s all the Team USA olympians who never made an all star team:  - Richard Jefferson (2004)  - Lamar Odom (2004)  - Emeka Okafor (2004)  - Tayshaun Prince (2008)  - Harrison Barnes (2016)  Using those guys as a benchmark…yeah, Keldon Johnson and JaVale seem worse."
Battier and its not close  If anything Harrison Barnes LOST the Warriors a championship
"I agree with you 1000%. We haven't seen Wiggins with Steph and a healthy Klay and from the looks of it, he's going to be a perfect fit. Harrison Barnes 2.0. Will Wiggins breakout? Not sure. But he'll be defended much less and could really be a great piece for us. Someone we'd regret moving as salary filler to get another star."
"Myles Turner, Harrison Barnes, Kyle Lowry"
"Lol, you think Harrison Barnes uses Reddit? He's probably in the gym working on his game right now. He might be the hardest working guy in the NBA."
- Harrison Barnes
"[barnes, harrison barnes](https://i.imgur.com/6ot9tB5.png)"
Wiggins is just there to match contracts. He had a pretty solid season and his contract only has 2 more years left. Teams were fighting to get Harrison Barnes last trade deadline so if he has another decent year he could be a positive asset
"He's improved, especially defensively, but he's not worth $32m. If he was a free agent he'd probably get somewhere in the $20m-$24m per year range in my opinion. Similar to what Harrison Barnes got in 2019."
It's Harrison Barnes time.
"The best players never go out for FIBA (no one in the USA really follows it) so it's actually rare we overcome the lack of team chemistry and win there.      If you go back and swap out Joe Harris for KD, Derrick White for Dame, a sophomore Donovan Mitchell for Devin Booker and Harrison Barnes for Draymond Green do you still think we lose in FIBA? I don't."
"&gt; Name one star player who is available, meaning he wants out or their team wants to trade them, and who by replacing one of the aforementioned four players  Firstly, why is Wiggins off the table? he should absolutely be on the trading block imo. Also, Where did I say that those pieces would return a star? We made the finals 2 years a row with Steph, Klay and Draymond at our core. What we need some are some great starting level players or veterans, like Iguodala in our 5 finals runs, like Harrison Barnes was. If they absolutely need to trade either Draymond or Klay in order to contend, I would be fine with that too depending on what we get in return.   &gt; You don’t see Warriors fans shitting on a trade for a player who meets the above criteria. You see us shitting on trades for players who are marginal improvements on one of the core 4 (or even downgrades in many respects, cough cough Simmons).  So you named one example in Simmons, who are some other players that were discussed who you think is a downgrade?  &gt; If wanting to give Curry one last shot at a title is the priority (which it should be), then maybe trading him to a team with more flexibility is what’s best for all involved (hurts to even type that).  This is off the table unless Steph requests it. If he doesn't request it, and they still do it, it would be the dumbest move in franchise history (maybe even league history) to trade Steph Curry right after he had an MVP caliber season  &gt; And maybe that’s why he hasn’t signed an extension yet, and why Bob has signaled that the team and him are both in wait-and-see mode.  Again, if Steph chooses to leave or request a trade, he would be completely justified in doing so. And it would signal an abject failure of this front office to build around Steph properly after Durant left. I'm not gonna sugarcoat with bs like ""maybe it was the end of their window"". If your star player is playing like Steph is, your team has absolutely no excuse to not surround him with enough talent."
"I don’t hate Bill Simmons but whenever he has Russillo on I feel like he gets exposed as a Big Dumb Sports Guy. He’s like a sports fan gasbag stereotype with 3 hours to kill twice a week.   He literally can’t go one thought without ranking all time bullshit or comparing a player to an old player. Every. Time.   “Devin Booker - I mean we’re talking top 7 all time in terms of a guard who can give you this for four quarters. I mean there’s Kobe. Michael….” And then he spends three minutes ranking the best players of all time. He does this basically regardless of what he talks about. Half the time Russillo just tells him he is full of shit and Bill doesn’t know what to say because everyone he hangs out with works for him and tells him he’s right.   His movie stuff is even worse cuz it’s the same haha. “Is John Krasinski the Ethan Hawke of Tom Cruises? I feel like he’s basically Harrison Barnes, got all the tools but just didn’t come together like he could have.”"
Like in 2011 when Steph sprained his ankle and played in [\*checks notes\*](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1168705-golden-state-warriors-final-2011-2012-season-report-card-backcourt) 26 games as the warriors tanked for the 7 pick to take harrison barnes
"&gt;There were other, cultural concerns. Jackson often emphasized his faith with the players. “It’s fine to be religious,” says one Warriors insider, “but it’s a different thing to bring it to your work.” When Jason Collins publicly announced his homosexuality in April 2013, Jackson told reporters, “I know Jason Collins; I know his family and am certainly praying for them.” This seemed particularly tone-deaf considering that Golden State COO Rick Welts, the first high-ranking sports executive to come out, worked in the same building. Welts says he approached Jackson and had “a nice conversation, like grown‑ups,” adding, “He knew how I felt, I knew how he felt. I’m sure he thought it was an opportunity to educate me, and I thought it was an opportunity to educate him.”  The time he told the team that Harrison Barnes was possessed by a demon... and he was serious.  And there's always the big one from r/nba where someone aggregated the bullshit Mark Jackson pulled. https://np.reddit.com/r/warriors/comments/42b5ne/what_exactly_is_mark_jackson_accused_suspected_of/cz93961/"
"It is going to be Harrison Barnes. He has been on the team before, can fit into any system, and will do what you need him to do."
"probably, this is the same mark jackson who tried to convince the warriors harrison barnes was possessed by a demon"
Bring Harrison Barnes back
"&gt;I am FAR from a KD stan but he is objectively one of the best Finals performers ever  He is objectively one of the best boxstat stuffers, but that's entirely based on 2017 and 2018. Unsuprisingly, you *only* looked at his scoring for 2012. He had a 9 percent ast%(4th on his team) and a 13 percnt tov percentage. He was ""objectively"" bad outside of scoring. Using 2012 is silly and a prime example of how overrated he is. There was a thread here comparing 2015 curry to 2012 durant where everyone said durant's run was better because(shock) the only thing they were going by was points per game and ts. When durant's role increased in the next three postseasons, his scoring fell off a cliff. His effiency dropped off more in the playoffs than giannis's has these last three playoffs. His scoring went from mj esque in the regular season to pelicans davis level in the postseason.  &gt;but KD was crazy in his first Finals against a good defensive team without Curry  He was not crazy. He scored well and was awful at everything else despite being asked to do very little outside of scoring. That's ""objectively"" subpar for a superstar. With the exception of 2014 kawhi, every single finals performance by a team's best player in the last 10 years was better than durant's 2012.  &gt;and he got it done on defense with the Warriors, averaging 1.6 and 2.3 blocks in 2017/2018  Using blocks to measure the defense of (at best) a secondary rim protector is just silly. The warriors defense was about as good with durant as it was without. DPIPM for the warriors those playoffs:Draymond, plus fiveeveryone else?  less than plus one  Durant's a solid defender, not a great one. By DRAPM durant wasn't even top 3 on the dubs.  &gt;bc if that’s all it was why wasn’t Harrison Barnes able to do the same thing?  Your argument that durant is ""OBJECTIVELY ONE OF THE GREATEST FINALS PERFORMERS"" is that he's better than harrison barnes? There is not a single superstar in the league who wouldn't have looked like an ""ALL TIME GREAT FINALS PERFORMER"" if they joined the warriors. In the first three series, curry outscored durant(including the one against the best defense in the league). Then ty lue decided that they'd force curry to be a playmaker instead of a scorer. Curry created fifteen scoring opprutnities a game for his teamamtes. Durant created three. You tell me who the quarterback was.  Why do you think the warriors were okay without curry and great without durant?  Do you think durant suddenly became a much better player than he was in okc where westbrook got higher plus minus, adjusted plus minus, and better box stats in the 14 and 16 playoffs?  [https://youtu.be/tlqRjA4JISs?t=27](https://youtu.be/tlqRjA4JISs?t=27)  Durant is a generational scorer. Giannis is a generational player. There's a difference."
"I’ll go out on a limb and say that even the Kings’ FO doesn’t view a roster of Fox, Simmons, and Harrison Barnes as contenders in the West. Sure we’re all speculating, but I really doubt they would trade unprotected picks in that package"
"Obviously this trade is a bit dated - I wrote this before Zac fucked up his foot again.  Also Detroit will probably be keeping Grant now that they won on the Cade sweepstakes. Luckily though, this trade works equally as well for Harrison Barnes and Sacramento."
"Ah, the Harrison Barnes"
I read HB as Harrison Barnes and got confused for a second.
"His contract is through 2024-25 so that means absolutely nothing. By then, KD, Kyrie, and Harden could have all opted out and joined the Kings so that Harrison Barnes can get his second, third, and fourth rings."
"That's everyone.  The players who were in 2016 and are still at least fringe all-stars but chose not to play are:  Paul George, Kyrie Irving, DeMar DeRozan, Harrison Barnes, and Jimmy Butler.   I think this team could have used those wing's defense."
"The reasons are pretty simple (obviously I’m a bit biased). Miami wasn’t a super team prior to Lebron’s move. He made it a super team, especially with the later addition of Bosh. Also, he raised a lot of money for charity with The Decision for what that’s worth. The Warriors were already a super team prior to KD. KD leaving in FA immediately after blowing the 3-1 lead over the 73-9 Warriors in the WCF is where most of the hate stems from. He was on the doorstep of the finals with his “own” team in OKC, but essentially decided to replace Harrison Barnes in GSW’s already stacked lineup. I mean I get it, he wanted to play with a lot of talent and some of his friends, but it’s a lot different than Lebron to Miami."
"i'm not familiar with what he wants to do, article had him included   &gt;The Kings would be looking to put Simmons, a 6-foot-11, 240-pound point guard, in a frontcourt position in a lineup featuring Fox, Tyrese Haliburton, Harrison Barnes and possibly Richaun Holmes, if they are able to keep him in free agency."
"2019 was a way worse roster than this one. The roster was Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Joe Harris, Brook Lopez, Middleton, Donovan Mitchell, Mason fucking Plumlee, Marcus Smart, Tatum, Myles Turner, Kemba, and Derrick White. Their best player at the time was Kemba. This team’s best player is Kevin Durant."
I watched that game in full. Damn you Harrison Barnes
Ideally trade CJ for picks and trade those picks to Sacramento for Harrison Barnes.
"Wiseman is younger now than Ayton was when we was drafted. Look at the list of players who have gone 7 overall in the last few years, Steph, Jamal Murray, Julias Randle, Killian Hayes, Harrison Barnes, Eric Gordon, Harrison Barnes  It actually has one of the highest hit rates of any draft pick"
Harrison Barnes and Joe Harris started.. wtf?
"But you are missing your glue guys that will play the game, both sides of the court.   Like what about Harrison Barnes? The perfect kind of player you want on a team like this."
"Beal, Lavine, Booker. They're 3 versions of the same player. Cut two of these guys to get a true center even if he's not a star and a playmaker PG that will play defense.  Dump KLove for someone versatile like Harrison Barnes."
"Love brings Olympic experience.   Harrison Barnes, Draymond Green, Andre Drummond, Mason Plumlee, etc...  That’s the quality you would get in Kevin Loves spot. Draymond is the only player better than Love on that list currently, but even in 2016, Love was a better player than Draymond."
Harrison barnes ISO’s!
"Fair, there's a lot of faux earnest troll posts here that come up so I was unnecessarily snappy.  To give some more context, Jackson actually did a good job in 2012-13. But in retrospect, it's clear some of the things he did very well were not necessarily intentional. If anything, I'm actually more critical of Jackson's coaching job that season than I used to be.  On the second game of the year, Brandon Rush tore his ACL. Rush's career never recovered. But before that point, he was a very solid 3+D wing who figured to peak as a Danny Green type. Harrison Barnes was already slotted in as the starting SF, but he then got thrust in 25-30 minutes a game. Andrew Bogut, who was acquired the season before while he was recovering from an ankle surgery, played the first games of the season, and then didn't play again until February or so.  So only 5 games into the season, the Warriors' were down two of their top 6-7 players. Under those circumstances, Jackson was forced to make adjustments and he actually made some really smart ones. Draymond Green got rotation minutes as a rookie, even though he was an even more horrific shooter than he is now. He was very useful even though he shot badly AND he was playing the 3 with Richard Jefferson at the 2 (mind you, RJeff killed the Warriors in the playoffs 3 years later at the 4). The Warriors frequently closed games with Steph Curry/Jarrett Jack/Klay Thompson/Carl Landry/David Lee lineups. Back in 2012-13, those teams had more spacing than other NBA teams and Lee's defensive shortcomings were masked with him at the 5. The Warriors surprised a lot of teams that year and Steph Curry really turned it up to end the season after being snubbed for what should have been his first All-Start appearance.  In the first game of the 2013 playoffs, David Lee tore his hamstring off the bone. The next game, Jackson went small with Barnes at the 4 and Jarrett Jack at the 2 and the Warriors quickly took control of the series. Steph had spacing around him and with Bogut setting screens, he tore apart the Nuggets and upset them as the sixth seed.  The Warriors then faced the Spurs, who they hadn't beat in San Antonio in nearly 15 years. The Warriors came within a possession of taking game 1 in overtime and Steph Curry had 42 points. There was a defensive breakdown at the end of the game that fucked things up, but it was clear the Warriors were not a fluke. They beat the Spurs decisively in game 2 when Klay Thompson got very hot. It looked like the Warriors might actually win that series, but Steph hurt his ankle and played decoy in the final two games of the series, and Bogut also reinjured his ankle and was very limited in the end of the series.   But in the final games of the series, Greg Popovich figured outsmarted Jackson in a way that later seemed prophetic. He put Tony Parker on Harrison Barnes and because the Warriors had a perceived mismatch, they fed Barnes in the post over and over again and Barnes had high volume scoring performances in the final games of that series. But the problem with a Barnes-centric offense is that it takes the ball out of the hands of Steph Curry and Klay Thompson. The Spurs won the math battle in those final games of the series and Popovic figured out a very exploitable flaw in Jackson's philosophy, which is that Jackson will attack ""mismatches"" whenever he sees them."
"If you have to ask, you weren't watching those Warriors teams.  Jackson had the Warriors passing less than almost any team in the NBA. Opposing teams could goad Jackson into calling ISO post-ups for pretty much any player on the roster so long as the other team put a smaller defender on a Warrior player. Jermaine O'Neal, Klay Thompson, and Harrison Barnes post-ups were a fundamental part of the 2013-14 Warriors' offense. Harrison Barnes played shooting guard in many bench lineups that year. Draymond Green was a 3 for much of the season, until Jackson finally started using him in closing lineups at the 4 next to Andrew Bogut. The Jermaine O'Neal/Mo Speights frontcourt was a thing. Kent Bazemore played the back-up point guard role. It was an absolute mess."
Harrison Barnes would be solid for you guys too. Not sure why they decided to move him for nothing.
"One thing I don’t hear talked about enough is that the Warriors aren’t really a team who takes risks. You can see that there are teams like the Blazers who are totally against risk, while teams like the Raptors, Nets, and Lakers have all made at least one massive gamble in the past few years.   Basketball’s a business, and the Warriors are a really high functioning business. They make a ton of money, and I’m just not sure that the Warriors will be willing to mess that up to appease Steph’s timeframe.   One thing to note is that Bob Myers is more than willing to pay the luxury tax, but that doesn’t necessarily mean he’s into taking risks with the Warriors. Let’s say, hypothetically, the Warriors cash in on their assets for Beal, he tears an ACL, has a slow recovery, and never gets back to 100% (more or less a Gordon Hayward situation). At that point you can say Curry isn’t going to win another ring with the Warriors, and Bob Myers is gonna lose a whole bunch of revenue dollars. Some teams take risks and others dont, both parties are fine. But a GM’s risk taking tendencies can tell a whole lot.   Also wanted to quickly say that signing KD was a big move, but not remotely a risk. They pretty much just lost Harrison Barnes and brought in the second best player on the planet at the time."
actually kinda interesting...lets say kyrie misses the shot in 2016 and then like harrison barnes hits a 3 with 20 seconds left to win Game 7...who would have gotten FMVP?
"Something I realized recently is that Harrison Barnes hasn’t played in the Playoffs since 2016 with the Warriors.   Since then, he played 2.5 seasons on the twilight years Mavs and 2.5 years on the Kings who are in the abyss."
"Hield makes a LOT of money, he might be really rough to trade. Was thinking it would be fun if they could trade him for Ben Simmons, throw a 4 PG lineup of Fox, Halliburton, Wright, and Simmons with Harrison Barnes. It would be insane but it would be fun."
"Kings fan here and actually thinking about writing a post.   Context  It’s important to remember that the Kings are in the Pacific Division (Suns, Lakers, Warriors, Clippers, and Kings) plus also in the Western Conference (TrailBlazers, Jazz, Nuggets, Timberwolves, Thunder, Grizzlies, Pelicans, Mavericks, Spurs, and Rockets), so they have to be GOOD. Like 4th through 7th seed good in the East (Atlanta, NY, Boston, Miami GOOD).  Plan  Advanced Stats wise Fox is low level all star good, but no Trae Young/Jimmy Butler/Tatum and while his shooting has improved he’s more of a 1 3PT made a game guy than 5. So we HAVE to win with Defense and Playmaking, as long as Fox is our main guy.  Maybe a hot take but I think Halliburton makes an all star team before Fox and usurps him by his 3rd year, but either way the game plan has to be let Halliburton run the offense and use Fox as a Wide Receiver with his speed while they share the court. Delon Wright/Buddy/Justin James/Terrance Davis off the bench for the 3rd guard spot.  Forward-wise older Harrison Barnes, promising Robert Woodard, and our likely SF draft pick (Franz Wagner) give us enough coverage at 3 to not get crushed by better Small Forwards. But we really fall apart at the big man spots (PF/C) with only Marvin Bagley as our only under contract player.  This is where it looks hopeless. Even Bagley believers think that his only value is returning a late 1st and getting his $11M salary off the books. In Monty’s shoes I move him via waive if we can’t get a 2nd rounder and free up his cap space. Once we have that $11M back, we can sign one off Holmes back/Daniel Thesis/Otto Porter Jr. to fill a PF or C spot, bring back Metu/Jones to give back up C minutes, and use our Midlevel to sign Bismack Biyambo or Dwight Howard.  From there it’s all about the entire 9 man rotation committing to running down the opposing teams shot clock every possession and using Fox’s athleticism to get in front of every fast break."
Where do you think Harrison Barnes and Doug McDermott are from?  Do you think they were playing pick up at a park in Ames Iowa against a bunch of 250 lb monsters bodying them up or something?
Harrison barnes is the ultimate choker. He was so bad that cleveland really didnt give a shit about him shooting
That 2019 team have a lot role players like harrison barnes and fringe all star players like middleton and kemba while this olympic's team is pretty much all star bar kevin love.
"Curry, he was basically a cheat code. He was fine on ball but he could also play off-ball and was willing to run around for his shot. He made it look easy to play with him and players like Harrison Barnes got paid big for it."
"They were hated when they got KD after going 73-9. I don't remember a lot of hate for their homegrown core of Steph, Klay, Dray, and Harrison Barnes."
"They needed someone who could score outside of the system, if needed. And Harrison Barnes was the weak link in that squad, so Durant would have made a major improvement anyway."
"Some of the best players available would be:  Lonzo Ball   Mikal Bridges  Andrew Wiggins  Aaron Gordon  DeAndre Hunter / Clint Capela  Danilo Gallinari   Bogdanovic  Two of Brogdan, Sabonis, LaVert, Turner  Brook Lopez  Joe Ingles  Jordan Clarkson  Seth Curry  Harrison Barnes  So you could have a lineup like  Lonzo Ball, Andrew Wiggins, Mikal Bridges, Danilo Gallinari, Brook Lopez"
When Harrison Barnes was traded (keep in mind I didn’t know KD was coming) I thought it was such a bone headed decision. He has all the tools of a top 10 scorer but just never seemed to fully put it together. He was 90% of the way there
"Rubio. I thought he would break assist records and be the first guy since Stockton to get the 14apg.   Harrison Barnes. I thought he was a franchise player.   Brandon Jennings. I basically thought he was going to be what Curry is now. Which is insane in retrospect lmao.   Mario Hezonja. Won me over with his cockiness, athleticism and seemingly the perfect size for a modern swing."
"Yeah I saw a ""Harrison Barnes finals lowlight"" compilation the other day and literally most of his misses are the same types of shots that KD takes  He just didn't miss them"
Kerrs detractors needs to go back and watch how the Warriors offense ran under Mark Jackson. Harrison Barnes post ups and random assortment of iso plays. Made me puke
They were a damn near perfect team that swapped out Harrison Barnes for Kevin Durant simultaneously weakening their biggest conference competitor lol
"They did suck, but having watched those teams, they weren't just bad, they were maddeningly bad.  We had Byron Scott who had been regarded as a pretty good coach.  He coached the Nets to the Finals in the early 2000's, coached CP3 on the Hornets to some really good years, was on the Cavs when Lebron was in Miami, and then came back to LA to lead an aging Kobe and Pau with random pieces.  He was the Tank Commander for a reason, his schemes and rotations made little sense for a coach who wasn't some newbie like Luke Walton was.  For someone who had success, it is more likely he sucked on purpose rather than on accident given the disparity in effort, though of course there's no way to prove that.  However, we won 27 games during those years bottoming out at 17, we didn't just suck, we historically sucked.  Its hard to say that even with bad players, we couldn't have swung a trade or gotten a free agent to make us at least competitive.    And Kobe being on the team proves my point.  He was our one star for years, it would have been disrespectful to not try to at least let him end his career with some dignity instead of 17 win shit team.  We gave him $50m for essentially sitting out, just because people still cared about him.  It would have taken almost no effort to pair him up with some more vets and tried to do something (like Jim Buss tried to do with Deng and Mozgov), but instead that was the last gasp of a guy being forced out of his team.  We barely tried because we didn't want to.  And another thing that proves my point: the Lakers' salary during the tank years.  You can say Byron sucked and our players sucked, but you cannot say our Front Office kept trying to put together a winning product.  [In 2012-2013](https://hoopshype.com/salaries/los_angeles_lakers/2012-2013/), we had the highest salary in the league at $100m.  When we started tanking the next year, we dropped only to #4 in the league but shaved off $25m.  The next year we dropped to #9 in the league, and the following year in 2015-2016 we dropped to #19.  This is not the salary of a team who's trying.  The next 3 years we were #19, #21, and #27 in league salary.  Why didn't we sign more Mozgov's and Deng's if we wanted to win?  There are plenty of vets we could throw a big contract to if we really wanted to go for it every year.  We could have at least maintained a top #10 ranking in salary if we wanted to compete, the Lakers' name plus the money would have gotten free agents to join, right?    The salary, more than anything, should be proof we didn't try.  We could give anyone money, who would turn down a fat check from the Lakers?  At the time Carmelo was bouncing around the league and Kobe was gone, we could have said to him ""Hey, here's $25m, come start for the Lakers and be the face of the franchise for a few years"".  Other than Melo, there were plenty of guys past their prime or guys good enough to make a team competitive that we could have thrown money at during the lean years.  Guys like Horford, Whiteside, Dion Waiters, Pau, Harrison Barnes, Gordon Hayward, Millsap, JJ Redick, Gallinari, Taj Gibson, Olynyk, Rudy Gay, Aaron Gordon, Zach Lavine, Derrick Favors, DeAndre Jordan, etc.  I'm sure not all of them would have come, and some of them were never going to leave their team, but if the Lakers came calling with a blank check, I've no doubt we could have gotten a few of those guys as our starters.  Other people who derisively talk about the Lakers brand would have to admit that in this case, it would support the argument that the Lakers didn't get them because they didn't try, not because they couldn't, which is evidence enough for me that we were taking on purpose and not on accident.  And yes, thank you for this discussion, its rare people can disagree without insults.  Kinda nice! 😁"
"&gt;Jackson got fired for things outside of basketball, not because of his coaching.  It was both, he was a mess behind the scenes but also he was terrible with adjustments and FO can only tolerate so much Harrison Barnes ISO"
"A lot of the teams you talked about tanked. Milwaukee let go of their veterans after drafting Giannis and won 15 games the following year. Golden State tanked to get Harrison Barnes. Wizards tanked for Beal (they tanked for 4 years and got Wall, Vesely, Beal and Porter).   Lakers tanked for 5 years and got the trade assets for AD, Cavs tanked for years to get Irving and assets for Love."
GSW winners of draft night. Imagine Kuminga instead of Harrison Can't-Hit-the-Side-of-a Barnes.
"I think Siakam makes a bit more sense, but I still have issues with that. I had a huge thread on the Blazers sub and most people tended to agree with me.  ""Siakam is interesting because he seems more available (I guess the Raptors are really taking this ""retool"" thing to heart). My issue with them though is that they're seriously looking for a haul. As I previously said, I don't think there's any player available that actually moves the needle. Because of this, I don't think it's worthwhile for the Blazers to fork over their entire future's worth of draft capital along with CJ for Siakam if that'll just result in a second-round exit.""  My TLDR was I'd try to arrange a 3-team trade for Harrison Barnes instead of Siakam. Barnes production isn't that far away from Siakam or Tobias Harris (the two major guys I've seen get thrown around) and most importantly I think Barnes could be obtained for substantially cheaper.  If there's no guy available that truly moves the needle, then don't mortgage your draft future for them. You can still make trades to field a better roster without breaking the bank. And if fielding a more competent roster still isn't enough to satisfy Dame then getting off CJ's contract makes your entire starting roster easier to move for more picks."
"Lots of things costed them 2016, but Harrison Barnes always sticks out for me.  Love the guy but a putrid Finals showing."
"They’re not better then Kevin Durant replacing Harrison barnes on a 73-9 team.  Also, he had shaq"
enter stage left:  Harrison Barnes
That piece being not Harrison Barnes lmao
"Nope.   There are only a few players that would make them as dominant as KD did, namely LeBron, Kawhi, PG13 or AD.  People really forget that Harrison Barnes was a good 2 ways players for the Warriors and without a good 2 ways wing the Warriors won't be able to use their death lineup at all.  If you replace KD with someone like Lillard, Westbrook etc and Houston win 17-18 season."
Especially when the guy you’ll replace is Harrison Barnes who had just played as if he was shooting with the wrong hand
Harrison Barnes was a perfect fit until he forgot how to shoot
Really wonder if KD has talked to Harrison Barnes about this at all.
Except Harrison Barnes
"They didn't even need to replace Harrison Barnes, it's extremely unlikely that he would ever play *that* terribly in a series ever again.     They could've run it back with him and still been champs the next season."
"Maybe I'm misunderstanding you, are you saying you don't think replacing Harrison Barnes on the 73-9 Warriors with Paul George is enough to beat the Cavs?"
"I mean, Warriors looked unstoppable with Harrison freaking Barnes as their starting SF. Every other SF would've been a perfect fit in that system, not just KD.  Probably they were going to win in 2017 and 2018 with PG or Butler as a replacement to Barnes.  KD joining them remains the boldest move ever."
"I don’t think they’re favorites over the Cavs without KD.  Even with 0/8 Harrison Barnes I’d still take the Cavs over them. I think KD was the huge deciding factor, it’s not just anybody could’ve done that.  Not just anyone can step on that team and have Steph say “ok, I’m the 2nd option”. Not saying they couldn’t win, but to act like probably the greatest scorer of this generation didn’t make them the overwhelming title favorites is insane"
Esp cause if harrison barnes shoots &gt;10% from the field the warriors would have won back to back. He went ice ice baby cold when he was the one being left wide open in the corner.
"First of all I agree they wouldn’t be as dominant with PG, but I think they’d be nearly as dominant (which is what the original comment said).   KD played incredible but I think you’re overestimating how important that was to beating the Cavs. If Harrison Barnes randomly averaged 25 ppg on good efficiency the series would be over in 4-5 games. That’s pretty much what PG would bring them, but with better defense.   Like, there are several game where Steph clearly outplayed KD and that didn’t stop the Warriors from winning comfortably."
"You seem to be missing context. He applied Pg Warriors would be just  as dominant as KD Warriors. Now if KD wasn’t FMVP and didn’t do much those series, I’d agree, but that isn’t the case. One would have to take a look at KD and PG as individual players to confirm this assumption and no logical person who’s arches the sport of basketball would say this.  Cause when one uses Context of what KD actually did those series, to say PG would dominant as much, makes an assumption that PG would outperform a top 5 player(Steph) and give performances not far behind the 2nd greatest player of all time, to which I’d say to you, if that’s your argument, this conversation is not worth having   “Replacing Harrison Barnes with PG” makes them better, it doesn’t mean they are guaranteed a victory like the other guy was applying. KD being a top 3 player at the time who was in a finals and multiple WCF, going to a 73 win team was big cause of the level of player going there.  PG going to a 73 win team(who lost btw, incase you forgot) means nothing to me as I do not believe they would be as favored to win as the KD Warriors. There is literally no argument in PGs case for this  You say “he doesn’t have to outperform Steph” but that was a big factor in why the KD Warriors stomped the Cavs. There is no basis to this augment that PG or any random all star could have gone to that team and immediately won. AD? Yes, Lebron himself? Of course? Harden? kawhi? Yes. PG and any other lower level all star? Not so fast. I don’t agree, and there’s nothing that can convince me lol"
"You seem to be veering into a KD vs PG or KD vs Steph debate, which this is not about. This is about a 73-9 team that won a championship and then lost a championship in game 7 replacing Harrison Barnes with Paul George. They don't go 16-1 but they obviously win back-to-back championships if healthy. PG doesn't have to outplay Steph for that to happen, all he has to do is outperform Barnes which is a given."
They didn't need Harrison Barnes either. Would have made them the title favorites. That's not competitive!
Any all star SF would be a perfect fit with a 73-9 team who won a championship and were 50 seconds away from going back to back without you. You swap out Harrison bumass Barnes with a real star/superstar that team becomes unbeatable.
"Harrison Barnes flashback, that was hard to watch again."
Harrison Barnes style
.......LOL extending harrison barnes wasnt enough? Yall really need KD. Yall were literally at game 7 in 2016 coming down to the last shot by Kyrie. NO just no.
"The weakest link was Harrison Barnes, and they added the second best small forward, a former MVP and scoring champ.   Klay, Steph, Draymond, and Iguadala (who could've started in Denver). You can't put together a better team in 2014-15   Lol yea they're not stacked.   Kevin love was a huge part of their championship, but he was obviously not the greatest PF, others proved to be effective. He was a lone star in Minnesota. They took a chance on Love and it paid off, but it was never a sure thing."
"Morey and those Dwight Magic didn't win a ring though. I remember specifically a lot of commentary around that time that said outside shooting was too unreliable to be counted on for a chip and that more traditional offense would always win titles.   The theory that the 3 opened up greater efficiency was certainly around pre-Steph. You're absolutely right about that. But it was him and Klay that together that changed the discussion from the theoretical to the practical. Guys like Duncan Robinson, Joe Harris and Evan Fournier don't get the nearly $20 million/year they're earning without Curry and Klay winning that first ring with Green, Bogut, Harrison Barnes and Iggy."
The Warriors should trade for Harrison Barnes.   I think he might be a good fit with that team.   And a center with a skill set similar to Andrew Bogut.   ;-)
"I think the Kings would have to offer something like Harrison Barnes, Mo Harkless and either Davion Mitchell / Haliburton"
Harrison Barnes. I hate that he sold during the 2016 finals. Nothing personal tho
"It was actually 80 million and here’s a list of players making the same or more than him next season.  Bojan Bogdanovic, Jarrett Allen, Clint Capela, Jerami Grant, Harrison Barnes, Gallinari, Gary Harris, Tim Hardaway, Buddy Hield  It’s honestly hilarious how Pelicans fans think losing a 38% 3PT shooter on high volume that plays borderline elite defense and has great synergy with Zion is a good thing…  That defense is going to be godawful this season.  Who’s your best defender? Hart? JV? Lmfao"
Scottie playing Iggy's role with Draymond at the 5 could actually work. Wiggins the new Harrison Barnes
"Ah yes, of course everyone remembers the exact numbers of the highly publicized and notorious Harrison Barnes extension offer in the fall of 2015 that NBA fans have tattooed in their minds as an unforgettable moment in league history. How foolish of me to correct a $10M error /s"
Harrison Barnes denying a 4/64 contract was the reason along with Curry's friendly deal and Klay/Dray still being on their rookie deals  If Harrison Barnes doesn't bet on himself and signs it there is no KD in GS
Luka fans were up in arms at Harrison Barnes shot attempts.  They’d rage at HB every post game thread.  Turns out maybe HB wasn’t the problem at all.
Mavs also dumped Harrison Barnes to make room for Porzingis.  They definitely ended up losing on the entire transaction.
"1. Steph has been more or less the same player since forever. He always knew his shot, motor, and handle were what he was best at and always predicated his game around those. He added some bulk, his execution has gotten sharper, but at the most basic level, he's the same player he was in college.  2. Mark Jackson's outdated ""offense"" had ""Steph do your thing"" in a priority somewhere below ""Harrison Barnes high post isolation"" and ""Iguodala/David Lee in-out game"". He was way too old-school to utilize Steph and Klay properly. Steph was just so good that he scored a ton anyways.  3. Popovich is one of the best coaches, in any sport, at using the talent at his disposal effectively (the latest example being DeMar DeRozan). He'd figure things out."
that means OKC would've maxed Harrison Barnes. is that what they wanted to do?
"Back then the concept of efficiency was foreign to the vast majority of fans. They saw that Monta scored a lot of points.  Also, if you watched his highlights, Monta looked like a GREAT player. His highlights were so much fun! The little guy, making all these twisty, turny moves, throwing up crazy-difficult shots.   But the moment you were aware of the concept of efficiency, the moment you started paying attention to all the shots that didn't go in, it became clear that Monta was a player who hurt you offensively if he was your primary shot creator. But that level of discourse was only for nerds back in 2012.   If you want a good laugh, check out this Bleacher Report winners and losers column:   [https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1103639-warriors-bucks-trade-winners-and-losers-in-monta-ellis-andrew-bogut-deal](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1103639-warriors-bucks-trade-winners-and-losers-in-monta-ellis-andrew-bogut-deal)  Winners: Bucks, Monta, Udoh, *Stephen Jackson*.   Losers: Warriors, Bogut.   That trade led directly to the Warriors championship, and Bogut re-establishing himself as an all-defensive-team level player. It contributed to the team losing more games that year (which landed them Harrison Barnes - they would have lost the pick if they won one more game). It also resulted in them putting the ball in Steph's hands more, and we all know how that worked out.  Meanwhile, Monta would play two largely ineffective seasons and then walk in free agency. Udoh would leave in free agency for the Clippers. Neither would have any meaningful NBA moments going forward. I think the Bucks realized almost instantly that Monta wasn't a winning player - that he could give you highlights and low-efficiency points if you built your offense around him, but that was it."
"As comical as this is, the game breaking bad call was the foul on Harrison Barnes. Without that one monstrous call, the Kings still win.  The announcers stanning the bad call make it more cringe.  Look at this Champion, Olympian that ""commits that foul"", as if there was a foul at all. They even show a second replay that completely cuts out the incidental contact. The minor contact happens well after the shot is released anyway, and is only caused by Rozier following through into Barnes' hand, well after the release.  To make it more egregious, the call comes from the ref behind the shooter, but only after he can see the shot is a clear miss. This type of referee dominance makes most NBA play unwatchable. If I'm wrong and this is a ""good call"", it doesn't make it acceptable to me, as the referee discretion in calling this type of interaction is too exploitable.     Edit: I forgot to mention; the Kings suck"
"tobias’ and ben’s aren’t even close. tobias is barely even worth half his contract lol. you can get harrison barnes for less than half his deal and he’s like 90% of the player.   i get it, everyone hates ben now, i’m not a big fan of him either. but he’s easily a more impactful player than harris, is a lot younger and on a better fitting team would probably be less exploitable than he is on the sixers"
"unfortunately they still lost the series and history doesn't care about the fine details of harrison ""bum"" barnes becoming a g league player"
"Yea Wall. Terrible contract. There’s some other bad ones out there too like Harrison Barnes, Hayward, Horford.   How about Deng getting paid last few years 5 million per to sit lol 😂"
Richaun Holmes is a fine rim protector. What they need are some actual positive forwards on the roster outside of Harrison Barnes. I dont disagree that Buddy should get moved
I think you’re not giving enough credit to Harrison Barnes for forgetting how to shoot a basketball but you’re dealing with enough salt as it is.
"I've heard Portland being thrown around a lot but the issue I have with that is that the Raptors are obviously looking for a haul and there's no player available that would actually move the needle for Portland. If that's the case, is really worth throwing away all of their future draft capital for a second-round exit at best?  The Blazers are obviously in a weird situation and while I agree that some move needs to be made, I'm more of the opinion they should go for someone like Harrison Barnes as a cheaper, but still solid enough option as a 2-way wing. Ideally, they're able to finesse a trade where they're able to get off CJ and only have to throw in a first and a few seconds to get him (obviously would require a 3-team trade).  Dame/Norm/Barnes/RoCo/Nurk is a very solid roster and I'd say the ceiling for that roster is about the same as one that has Pascal in place of Harrison Barnes. If that's the case, then yeah I'm a major proponent of trying to upgrade the team without having to burn a bunch of draft capital *because the result will be the same regardless*"
Harrison Barnes
"i have one  steph is better than kd, has been since his first mvp, and their time together on gs proved it.  but people got enamored w kd getting to play 1v1 and shooting over guys like fucking pat bev in the playoffs instead of realizing teams were so scared of steph getting hot they played kd like he was harrison barnes all the way to both finals mvps.  kd is the welfare prince of the nba. hes not really like that, but he gets hyped over actual winners like steph and giannis bc he joined gs and people like how he plays"
Unpopular but sure let’s do it:   Lower end stars:  5 Jimmy Butlers could make some noise.  5 Luka’s don’t even think I have to explain  5 all star level Julius Randle’s would lose but fight  5 Kris Middleton’s would get shredded on defense  High End Role players:  5 Harrison Barnes  5 Tobias Harris 5 SGA
KP. Dante Exum. Harrison Barnes.
Durant is 0-1 too  Don’t give him credit for replacing Harrison Barnes on a team that already won and were favorites before he joined
With every passing year harrison barnes just seems to dissapoint more and more....thought he was gunna be special
Harrison Barnes. Dude is super solid
"As a UNC fan, I fully thought that team with Ty Lawson and Harrison Barnes was going to produce multiple superstars.  Also who wasn’t high on Michael Beasley? 😂"
"I agree, I think he’s much more of a Harrison Barnes type /s"
Hey whats yer problem with Harrison Barnes
He's a combination of Harrison Barnes and Scottie Pippen.
"Yeah Wiggins is like a better version of harrison barnes, especially with klay back."
"Based on his time with us, it was a combination of low bball IQ, inconsistent shot, and poor awareness on defense. Had all the tools to be a Harrison Barnes type of stretch 3/4, but couldn't put it all together"
"They won against LeBron, Mozgov, and Dellavadova lmao  Harrison Barnes was literally the reason the Warriors lost in 2016"
Proven winner vs a guy who replaced Harrison Barnes in the Warriors dynasty.
"The finals MVP was up for grabs, literally any other superstar would've won in his place, Harrison Barnes did."
"&gt;Literal 2 time finals mvp and the best player on the best team ever. Absolute scrub!  Lmao he was a finals MVP like Iggy was, ""best team ever"" that didn't beat anybody lmao.  GS was winning with Harrison Barnes in his place."
"&gt; I think our disconnect is Bledose wasn't suppose to be Harrison Barnes, he was suppose to be Draymond (or Klay, depending on who you thought was better pre KD).   I think our disconnect is in how we evaluate Bledsoe. You clearly had very high expectations for him, but he has never shown he was that good.   It’s crazy to expect him to be the 3rd star. He is  not near the 3 guards I mentioned. The bucks were the first team in his career where he had to play a major role on a team playing important games.   Guys like jrue, Lowry and Conley were higher options on playoff teams in the past. They shown they can lead playoff teams, not to contender levels obviously, but some pretty decent teams.   If you can look at what Middleton did the last 2 years to excuse his 2019 performance, you can do the same for Bledsoe and realize he just ain’t that good lol. He is nowhere near as impactful as guys like jrue and Lowry. Lowry had made an all nba team. Bledsoe averaging his numbers on mediocre teams going nowhere isn’t that impressive. I think the suns won 48 games once with him, but that’s it.   Don’t forget Brogdon was still on the team in 2019. He was killing us. So lowry wasn’t always sagging off and doubling Middleton. The bucks had pretty good spacing, plus a superstar in giannis, I don’t think the double teams on Middleton were that extreme to make him play that poorly.   Maybe Middleton just got way better after 2019. He realize she got shutdown too easily, and he worked on his game. Sometimes you just have to experience the lows and take the L to realize the flaws in your game that need to be addressed. Giannis was the same way, and now he’s a champ."
"&gt;I just think the 2nd best player on the team deserves blame over a lesser known star. It’s like warriors fans blaming Barnes for 2016 when donkey got suspended  I think our disconnect is Bledose wasn't suppose to be Harrison Barnes, he was suppose to be Draymond (or Klay, depending on who you thought was better pre KD). Now maybe that was a little to high of expectation, but his expectations going into the playoffs was the 3rd scorer/playmaker, not a role player  The other problem with Bledsoe was his shooting. Lowry was so far away from him that he could either sit in the lane and wait for Giannis or go and double Khris   &gt;I don’t see how Middleton role changed that much under coach bud.  Under Kidd, he would hold onto the ball for 8 seconds as he backs his defender down in the midrange and get the exact look he wants. He didn't look to pass that much, it was where is my spot and how do I get there. In 2019 he went to an offense where he would wait for the ball to naturally find him and make a play as quick as he can. Under Bud he's turned into a shot creator (not just someone who can hit the open man, but create open looks for teammates) willing off ball scorer and 3 point sniper. The last 2 playoffs it feels like he's been given more freedom to play how he used to, as it seemed he had more iso and midrange this postseason   &gt;Also Bledsoe was seen as a guy that was supposed to be the 3rd option, but who thought he was sane level as Lowry/jrue/Kemba? That’s crazy.  Maybe he was slightly below them, but he averaged 17, 5 (with 2, 20 point seasons and one season with back to back 40 games) with 45 or higher shooting for 4 years in Phoenix, with other good guards. During the regular seaso for Milwaukee he would put up similar numbers with better defense. Jrue didn't put up similar numbers this year"
Harrison Barnes was absolute gold for the Cavs in the 2016 finals too
"What OG Anubody/Aaron Gordon type player could they get that would be better than Harrison Barnes? He’s not the best, but who’s available that would be an upgrade?"
"He's always done pretty well with the resources at his disposal. Bear in mind that the Warriors never had a top 20 pick between Harrison Barnes and James Wiseman. The price of success is low draft picks (and tight cap room).  In the 90s you just knew the Warriors were going to blow it every time, but now I feel like the FO is going to make a smart decision 90% of the time. Even when it doesn't quite click like Wanamaker or Oubre, you can at least understand the reasoning."

"1st Steph injured his knee and rushed back bc the Warriors were legit struggling to move through the early rounds. He was limited that post season, but the team was handicapped without him.  2nd OKC's offense was limited to the greatest scorer in the league (maybe in history) in KD. Their 2nd option was a prime Westbrook. The Warriors had Steph, Klay, and then... Draymond? Harrison Barnes?(they would have beat the Cavs if he could just hit hit his open 3's!!)  3rd (if?) what the Thunder line up lacked in scoring they made up for in line up flexibility. Their small ball line up was crazy, they had KD at the 4/5 dunking on everybody in the ""Lineup of Death"", forcing the Warriors to play Bogut more for rim protection.. which the Thunder would counter with their two capable 7fters in Kanter and Adam's.  4th Steph only started losing to LeBron after Draymond was suspended one game, Iguodala got hurt (back spasms; Game 5 I think) and was limited, and Bogut got injured and was out for the rest of the series (Game 5 I think. Remember, he was their rim protector, all of a sudden the paint was open for LeBron). Under that logic, Steph beat LeBron the year before and Kyrie/Love being hurt are irrelevant. So Steph deserves 1st tier on that alone, bc that's more than KD has done solo.  5th He was the 2nd best player but the most important player for that Warriors team. That's part of what makes Steph great, he's a winner and a team player. Spin the narrative how you want, but KD joined Steph's Warriors bc he wanted to finally win, not the other way around..."

not a bad player. bad fit for the sixers. awful awful contract   Harrison Barnes is less than half the cost for 90% of the production
"How didn’t LeGM think about replacing Harrison Barnes on the 73-win Warriors? Same on you, LeMickey 😤"
"I still can't believe Harrison Barnes shot 5/32 in those last 3 games, a lot being open looks"
Harrison Barnes could have.  This is not unpopular by any means.
"Yeah! That's pretty much my recollection of it as well, it made for some nice images with the sunset and whatnot but no much of a basketball game.  What I had forgotten however, looking back at the box score for the game after posting my comment, is how many talented dudes this UNC team had. Harrison Barnes, Tyler Zeller, John Henson, Reggie Bullock, Kendall Marshall and J.M McDoo all have had some time in the NBA."
People talk about the Boget injury and the Draymond suspension for not winning in 2016. But they honestly could have won if Harrison Barnes didn't shit the bed
Ok fine. Harrison Barnes could’ve been the next LeBron James but had to take a backseat when the dubs got Andre!
"I have the exact opposite opinion of Michael Porter Jr. He's a huge defensive liability - it's a combination of bad defensive IQ, limited effort, and unimpressive lateral quickness. On offense he's an impressive shooter and has good athleticism, but his handles need to improve if he's going to be more than a Harrison Barnes / Rudy Gay type. He's also bad at reading the defense and very bad at passing, although that can be improved."
Irrc Harrison Barnes played in that game
I don’t think this is particularly unpopular. The Warriors won a championship previously with Harrison Barnes at forward who wasnt even an all star caliber player.
Mark my words Mulder is gonna reverse Harrison Barnes and hit every clutch shot in the NBA finals.
"FVV has the same type of value as Brogdan, Harrison Barnes, CJ McCollum"
"Maybe you don't mean to do this, but your comment comes off like you're arguing in bad faith. Morey isn't proposing Simmons for Wiggins straight up. He was asking for Wiggins, Wiseman, Kuminga/Moody, and future firsts. That doesn't sound like good value to me. But I'm not a GM, so I'm reluctant to have a strong opinion about it.  Also, if we're talking about the main point, most Warriors fans acknowledge that Simmons is better than Wiggins in a vacuum. But if you followed the Warriors last year, you'd know that one of our biggest issues was spacing around Curry. Adding replacing one of the team's best shooters with one of the worst shooters in the league compounds that problem.  What we need isn't another Draymond. What we need is Harrison Barnes. Wiggins fits that role perfectly."
"Three-way trade is more likely. Who's the loser here:  Sixers get:   * Dame Lillard  Blazers get:   * De'Aaron Fox  * Harrison Barnes  * Matisse Thybulle  * 3 Sixers 1sts  Kings get:   * Ben Simmons  * CJ McCollum  * Tyrese Maxey   Sixers get their all nba PG to pair with Embiid. Lillard/Curry/Green/Harris/Embiid is filthy. Easy yes to go all in  Blazers actually improve, in my opinion. Fox/Norm/Barnes/RoCo/Nurk plus Thybulle as a young stud off the bench, plus future picks, is pretty damn good and isn't a three-undersized-guards lineup  Kings get players to make the playoffs with. Davion/Haliburton/McCollum/Simmons/Holmes with Maxey, Buddy, Bagley, TT off the bench is a playoff team  Point is, I think there's something here."
Looney has never played in their closing lineup in the playoffs. The closing lineup for the Warriors has historically been Dray + 4 guys who can actually space the floor.  I don't see why they would tear up the system that got them a ring and a 73 win season even without KD.  Simmons would be the third best playmaker and fifth best scorer on the floor for the Warriors. That's not a great improvement for the 19th ranked offense last season. Sure he's elite defensively but the Warriors already have a top 5 defense.  We also saw detrimental a second non shooter could be for the Warriors (Harrison Barnes in the '16 finals)
"Sorry for the belated response but I did want to get back to everyone here.  Look at the end of the day there's no needle-changing player that Portland can obtain right now. But by competent I mean moving away from an undersized backcourt and giving Dame a proper 2-way forward which he hasn't had since Nic Batum dipped.  Unfortunately trying to find a proper 2-way forward to pair with Dame is extremely difficult right now considering who may or may not be available and the fact that CJ's contract diminishes his actual value.  The big names I've heard are Harrison Barnes, Tobias Harris and Pascal Siakam. I don't think Harris is going anywhere; his contract is an albatross but he provides consistent value to Philly who's looking to contend with Embiid right now.  Siakam may be available, but it'd probably take CJ + all of Portland's firsts and I don't think Portland dumping the bank for Pascal is the needle-changing move. It gets them to a second-round exit at best and I'd also be worried about the fit of Siakam and RoCo since I don't trust either of those guys to defend the 3.   Harrison Barnes is the worst of those 3 guys but not by a huge margin and I think with the right trade CJ could be swapped for Barnes without having to fork over a ton of draft picks.  This is allows you to build a competent team around Dame to the best of your abilities and if Dame still decides to dip it's a lot easier to build for the future by owning your own picks and having trade-able assets."

Siakam may be available, but it'd probably take CJ + all of Portland's firsts and I don't think Portland dumping the bank for Pascal is the needle-changing move. It gets them to a second-round exit at best. To be fair, there is no needle-changing move.  Harrison Barnes is the worst of those 3 guys but not by a huge margin and I think with the right trade CJ could be swapped for Barnes without having to fork over a ton of draft picks.  This is allows you to build a competent team around Dame to the best of your abilities and if Dame still decides to dip it's a lot easier to build for the future by owning your own picks and having trade-able assets."
"Sorry for the belated response but I did want to get back to everyone here.   In a vacuum absolutely, but Barnes is a much better *fit* on the Blazers who haven't had a proper 2-way wing since Nic Batum.  Also trying to find a proper 2-way forward to pair with Dame is extremely difficult right now considering who may or may not be available and the fact that CJ's contract diminishes his actual value.  The big names I've heard are Harrison Barnes, Tobias Harris and Pascal Siakam. I don't think Harris is going anywhere; his contract is an albatross but he provides consistent value to Philly who's looking to contend with Embiid right now.

or Harrison Barnes when warriors blew 3-1
danny green 2020? harrison barnes 2016? every single role player that plays w lebron after he losses in a finals?
"He had the one against Dallas a couple years ago, might’ve been Harrison Barnes best game with us"
"I was curious so I actually ran the numbers, looks like he actually started greatly reducing his midrange attempt rate in Minnesota that season he got traded, so his mini-leap actually started before GSW: https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/prx965/poole_it_was_six_months_ago_that_andrew_wiggins/hdqz81w/  That said, he fits way way better next to Steph/Draymond, who are elite facilitators and good/great defenders, than KAT. He's basically a slightly better Harrison Barnes at this point, which is actually okay because we were going to max HB if we didn't get KD in 2016 lol."
Getting serious Harrison Barnes PTSD here.
"Joe ""2016"" Harrison Barnes"
"The problem wasn’t the Warriors or the rest of the league didn’t know Draymond was nice. The problem was that everyone knew Draymond was nice by his second season but he was a second round pick stuck behind David Lee, who’s an established all star making a ton of money, Andrew Bogut who they traded Monta Ellis for, and Harrison Barnes, who was a top 10 pick in the same draft as Draymond aka greater investment of assets by the organization.   Draymond was going to be a free agent by the end of the 2014-2015 season because he was a second round pick, so his rookie deal finished a year early. I’m not sure the Warriors offer/match Draymond a max deal as a sixth/seventh man if Lee didn’t get hurt, and there is a good chance another deal offers Draymond the max. It could very well be the same thing with what happened to Gilbert Arenas getting drafted by the Warriors"
"Sixers get: Hield, Brogdon + Kings first  Kings get: Simmons, Jeremy Lamb  Pacers get: Harrison Barnes, Davion Mitchell"
"Because the rest of the offence was Harrison Barnes Isos, Klay Post ups and David Lee Post ups. Steph was not the reason that offence wasn't as good as later years, it was Mark Jackson being dogshit at his job. That team then had Kerr as coach the next year and won 67 games and the ship in a stacked western conference. Steph definitely is better playing a mix of on and off-ball because his shooting, screen setting and constant movement are all GOAT level. That doesn't take away from how good he is on-ball though and he plays very similar to Dame on-ball in his shot selection only he finishes better at the rim and from 3.   Didn't realise he was having such a good season till that point, however it's still such an outlier from his previous seasons that I'm not really willing to say he would definitely have kept it up. He probably wouldn't have dropped to 22/7 averages without an injury though I agree. I seem to remember CJ having a ridiculous start to the season before an injury as well? Seems like you guys have had some shit luck with injuries as players are coming into their best form."
"I think the prospect of sending him to Sacramento for something like Harrison Barnes, Tyrese Halliburton, and Tristan Thompson maybe led Morey and Rivers to reassess the situation."
"Sure, but I wouldn't have said Harrison Barnes was 'great' offensively either. But it's certainly a nice fit."
We won 73 games with Harrison Barnes in that role. Wiggins fits nicely.
"De'Aaron Fox, Tyrese Haliburton, Harrison Barnes, Ben Simmons, Richaun Holmes.   Terence Davis, Louis King, Mo Harkless, Chimezie Metu, Tristan Thompson."
"&gt;my point is these teams should rebuild through the draft or continue to develop those players   They would be rebuilding through the draft in hopes of getting a player as talented as Simmons. Why do that when you can accordingly trade for him when he’s still young on a long term deal?   &gt;not trade for ben simmons and his giant contract.   You’re eventually going to have to pay players no matter what and all these guys I named are on starter level, high starter level contracts and some like Sexton, hunter, reddish may all see new deals nearing 20+ despite not being nearly as good as Simmons. Money isn’t a problem.    &gt;if the pistons traded cade cunningham for simmons it would probably make them better, would they ever do that tho?   Ok but we’re not talking about #1 pick Cade Cunningham, we’re talking about rotational guys like Fred VanVleet, Derrick white, Harrison Barnes, Collin Sexton etc."
"Avoiding Star players here—-  Watch: TJ McConnell, Harrison Barnes, Mike Conley, Marcus Smart  Don’t Watch: Malik Monk, Aron Baynes, Eric Bledsoe"
"It's easy to be a draft savant when you have hindsight on your side.  I am looking at the drafts now in fact. Look at the top 5's:  2013: Bennett, Oladipo, Otto Porter Jr, Cody Zeller, Alex Len   2014: Wiggins, Jabari, Embiid, Gordon, Dante Exum   2 out of 10 players ended up being great. If anything it makes the Cavs look better for trading while the guys still had high value.  The guys still available when they drafted Waiters were Thomas Robinson, Lillard, Harrison Barnes, Terrence Ross, Andre Drummond, Austin Rivers, Meyers Leonard, Jeremy Lamb, Kendall Marshall, John Henson, etc. So in all these scenarios there's one really great player that they missed (and 4-5 other teams passed on as well). If they took Giannis #1 in 2013 the GM would've been fired on the spot.   The Bennett pick is bad and one of the worst of all-time. But even that the likely alternative would've still been considered one of the biggest busts ever (unless they took Oladipo). I remember the hype leading up to the draft Alex Len was the most common projected #1. The other picks range from average to pretty good. They took TT over Jan Vesely, Biyombo, Knight, etc. Kyrie over Derrick Williams."

I've never seen a team get drastically worse while also giving up multiple firsts and a promising 21 year old  Genuinely one of the most horrible CJ trades I've ever seen for us. And I'm saying that as someone who would at least *consider* trading him for Harrison Barnes straight up lol."
82-0 might be a reach but something something 73-9 would be close for this team if you replace KD with Harrison Barnes
"Hmm it just doesn’t look right. Maybe swap out KD for my man Harrison Barnes. Now THAT team looks like it’s winning at LEAST 70, 71, maybe even 72 games!"

"Man... you're being *reallllly* easy on your own club.  Not saying Warriors made a bad strategic decision-- you just can't really give them kudos for young guy development post 2012 draft (where they got Harrison Barnes and Draymond).   Paschall was drafted 41st and recently traded straight-up for a protected 2nd round pick-- not really a ""success"", that's breaking even.    So that leaves you with 8 years worth of opportunity, and all you've got is Jordan Poole to show for it. &lt;Sad face&gt;   Since 2013, Spurs have drafted:   2014 Kyle Anderson (30th)   2016 Dejounte Murray (29)   2017 Derrick White (29)   2018 Lonnie Walker (18)   2019 Keldon Johnson (29)   2020 Devin Vassell (11)    Too bad the Spurs didn't have an opportunity to draft at number 2.  I'm jealous."
"And they still kind of messed up drafting after he left and they sucked again. The only good pick they did was Kyrie and that was the easiest #1 pick in that era besides AD. In 2011 if they draft Kyrie &amp; Klay that’s amazing back court that would provide some of the most spacing ever and with Klay being the greatest off ball shooter he wouldn’t get in the way of Kyrie &amp; then eventually LeBron as well. In 2012 instead of drafting Dion Waiters, they should’ve drafted Harrison Barnes to have him play at the wing alongside Klay Thompson to make a very good defensive wing unit and keep LeBron at the 4 so the Cavs stay elite defensively and never have the drop off on the defensive end that they had in the 16-17 season. And with knowing how weak the 2013 NBA Draft is now, I think the Cavs should’ve traded the #1 pick to move down and get assets for future drafts. So in this scenario the Cavs draft CJ McCollum and have him be their 6th man off the bench with anywhere between the 5-10 pick if they traded down and instead of drafting Sergey with the 19th pick in the 2013 draft, they drafted Tony Snell who becomes another defensive wing off the bench that can shoot. Then the last move I would’ve made was trade some of those assets I got for trading the #1 pick to get Al Horford and have him play center so the team would’ve been ahead of the versatility bigs who can switch on the perimeter while stretching the floor. If the Cavs would’ve built their team like this, they could’ve been a 70 win+ team I truly believe and would’ve made those Heat teams look like amateurs."
Hmmm Harrison Barnes sure had a growth spurt   Shame it cost him 5 numbers on his jersey
The Warriors still would've won if Harrison Barnes could hit half his open shots
"I don't think so. KD was a positional replacement of Harrison Barnes. So it worked out really well. The rotations would look very different if we replace Wiggins with Dame. Getting Dame would be awesome but he is not the missing piece.  My guess is the Warriors will trade Wiggins for a couple of $5M to $10M salary range players. Due to the repeater tax, they are losing the edge when it comes to building a good bench.  Unless they have the need to write off Klay due to his injuries, I don't think they have to find another max player."
"Yeah sure, there is zero difference between a 47 win team clearing salary to sign LeBron and Bosh and have Mario Chalmers be their 4th best player and a 73 win team replacing Harrison Barnes and Andrew Bogut with Durant…"
"If we are talking about a semi realistic trade package to get Curry and Klay on the Wolves with Durant, meaning Towns and draft picks at bare minimum, it wouldn’t be a problem for the balance of the league to have a contending team play in Minnesota. And that isn’t the same as having Durant replace Harrison Barnes and Andrew Bogut on a 73 win roster."
"It was the best first round ever in general. And this series was the best of them IMO. There were some ridiculous KD shots. Tony Allen vs KD was one of the most fun playoff matchups to watch.   I just wish the Grizz had gotten a 3. If they had just gotten Harrison Barnes instead of Parsons, they probably would have had one more run in them."
"&gt; Harrison barnes  Great example, the 25% usage in DAL was too much.  His % Assisted dropped so much in those seasons from so much creating off the dribble."
"Harrison barnes  Dallas: Usage 23.7-25.3, TS% 53.8-54.1  Sac: Usage 16.3-17.2, TS% 57.8-62.6"
Option 1: CJ  Option 2: Harrison Barnes and either Hali/Davion Mitchell
"Smush Parker and Chris Mihm were both starters for the Lakers in 2005-2006.  That season was also coincidentally the best seasons of their respective careers (numbers wise). They were both out of the league within 3 years after that season.  Here's how much Kobe was handicapped by these guys and why he deserves more credit for taking the Suns to 7.  First things first, Chris Mihm gets injured in March, does not play in the playoffs.  now Smush:  * 2006 game 4 - Smush goes 2/12 for 5 points.  1/5 from 3.  Also contributed 5 personal fouls.  Lakers eek out a win 99-98. * game 5 - Lakers get blown out 114-97.  Smush goes 1/7 for 5 points.  1/3 from 3.  No assists, 3 rebounds. * game 6 - Lakers lose 126-118 in overtime.  Smush goes 0/5 fg, 0/2 from 3.  no rebounds, 2 assists **FOULS OUT OF THE GAME**.   And he played **FORTY TWO MINUTES**!! (Smush has just an average game and the Lakers advance to the next round) * game 7 - Lakers get blown out 121-90.  SMush goes 4/13, 1/6 from 3.  for 9 points.  3 turnovers, 3 fouls.  Who cares, they didn't stand a chance in this game.  You wonder why Kobe was a dick to this guy?  How about scoring 50, losing the game, while your starting PG scores 2 points while holding the opponent PG to a measely 32 points on 9/14 shooting while giving up 13 free throws.  We saw with Harrison Barnes how a single player's poor play can hand the series to the other team.  PS: I forgot to mention their starting SF was Luke Walton."
tbf it wouldn't be a spectacle if it were Harrison Barnes instead of LeBron.
"That's just like your opinion man. And mine's mine.  Zeke won in the era of Bird, Magic, and MJ. Has a winning playoff record against each of them. Especially when no one believed a small guard could lead a team to a championship. He inspired a whole city and its kids to dream again, everyone loves him in Detroit. See Chris Webber's HoF speech just as an example.  Steph is just a product of being at the right place at the right time. He luckily got Klay, Harrison Barnes, and Draymond at the right time. I think even Nash could have been better than Steph if he was drafted in 2009. Nash was a better passer and a comparable shooter."
"Yes. Now he is paid about the same money as ""guys worth that money"" like Buddy Hield, Mike Conley, Gary Harris, Danilo Gallinari, Harrison Barnes, Jarrett Allen, Goran Dragic, Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe, and Al Horford.   10 million less than Kristaps, Blake, Pascal, Wiggins, Kevin Love, McCollum, D'Lo, and Gordon Hayward.  Obviously some of these are overpays but market value for a 25 year old who is really good at one thing, and can be made better at the others? 22m a year is probably what standard looks like."
This man keeps getting overpaid. I mean. It's like Harrison Barnes and Gordon Hayward.
Harrison Barnes &gt; Demar Derozan
Totally different situations. One teams trying to win + it’s not like Denver could’ve signed Harrison Barnes to an extension
"I actually feel like Gordon overall might be better than tobias, Barnes and tobias was harder to choose between but during the playoffs this year tobi was almost a non factor. Harrison has a pretty good season this year"
I also think Harrison Barnes gets paid less or about the same and he’s much better.
"People are out here saying Harrison Barnes getting payed $20 million a year is a grossly overpaid contract, say whatever your want, Barnes is a far superior player to Aaron Gordon Jesus"
No it was to leave Harrison Barnes wide ass open and watch him shoot 20% and lobby the NBA for a suspension.
"I don't think Fox was ever seriously on the table, but there might be something centered around Garrison Matthews or draft assets with Buddy and Harrison Barnes as veteran players/salary filler."
"stop it, he is not 90% of Tobias. at times Tobias was the best player on the sixers last playoffs, Harrison Barnes has wilted in every playoff series he's played in. however, i will concede that when accounting for their contracts, Barnes would suit the Sixers better."
"Harrison Barnes is not a semi-available player, he's not available at all.  He's the only true forward we have on the team.  We're looking to get into the playoffs, not get future draft assets."
"Yeah he'd be ideal.   It's the same reason we kept getting linked to Kyle Anderson, Larry Nance Jr. and to an extent Harrison Barnes.   A 2-way wing with some size and shooting is exactly what we're after.   Grant would be the best of the bunch though."
"I desperately wanted to see Grant on a contender (was especially disappointed when he didn't re-sign with Denver) but by all accounts the dude wanted to both bet on himself with Detroit and was really enamored with the idea of playing for a black coach in a city with a strong black community.   I still think the Pistons could get a godfather offer from a contender, but it'd look awfully bad on them if a city that gets zero free agents trades away a player that wanted to be there. Also now that the Pistons drafted Cade, the pairing between him and Grant looks a ton better.   If any team is looking for a semi-available wing player I'll gladly throw Harrison Barnes' name out."
They’re making fun of the Warriors version of Harrison Barnes today we’re good
Steve Kerr saved MJ's legacy by shooting.  Ray Allen saved LBJ's legacy by shooting.  Harrison Barnes saved KD's legacy by shooting.
Harrison Barnes saved KD's legacy.
Harrison Barnes slander? Weird
I can’t believe this isn’t mentioned more but: 2016 NBA Finals Game 7. 92-89 Cavs leading AND with the possession after Kyrie tried that weird rushed shot and got the back ball.  There’s now 21 sec on game clock and 14 second on shot clock. Cavs are not in the bonus so no need to foul as there is a 7 second difference so if they can force a miss and get a rebound then Warriors have another chance to tie with 5 ish seconds and TWO timeouts BUT…  Harrison Barnes fouls Lebron for no apparent reason which resets the shot clock from 11 seconds back to 14 because Cavs weren’t in the bonus so now Cavs get back the ball with 18.7 sec game clock and 14 sec shot clock…lebron almost dunks on draymond and that’s about wraps it up after free throws.
"Or even just gone to Boston, Houston, Portland, or Washington or something. Not replaced Harrison Barnes on a 73 win roster. 4 good teams battling for the throne (Warriors, Cavs, Spurs, OKC) suddenly became 1 ultra team and 2 good teams.  He tipped the balance too hard"
Harrison Barnes is a pretty talented player that you expect to hit those kinds of shots
Not too say harrison Barnes didnt choke a dick but he's a role player. Its funny how people blame him when he's not a star on the team.
lmao somebody woke up and said “i ducking hate harrison barnes” 😂
"Also, Harrison Barnes has 2 :)"
"That's crazy to see Curry, Klay, Dray, Iggy, and I think Harrison Barnes on the court at the same time the season before the Warriors ascent. No one in that arena knew what was going to happen to basketball the next season."
Imagine going 73-9 and then being able to replace Harrison Barnes with Kevin Durant lmao  Sometimes I still wonder how we almost beat that team
Joe Harris pulled a Harrison Barnes
2017 KD being there means Harrison Barnes goes to the bench and makes them more unstoppable… plus 2016 Bogut moves better than 2019 Bogut so that combo builds better chemistry  peak KD with peak Steph = scary hours and you also have peak Draymond? Good lord
"By this logic wouldn’t KD have been smarter to stay with OKC?    If the Warriors needed KD to win, then KD could’ve stayed with OKC, defeated the Warriors the following season and redeemed their 3-1 blown series lead in 2016.     KD clearly believed that the Warriors were too difficult to beat, so he joined them instead.      I think if the Warriors run it back in 2017 with Harrison Barnes, they have just as good of a shot as anyone to win the title."
Harrison Barnes and Draymond Green might not be the best combo but they certainly set up that championship team.
Harrison Barnes &amp; Draymond Green
idk...2016 warriors went 73-9 with Harrison barnes at the 3 instead of KD.  I wouldn't sleep on the warriors just yet
Harrison Barnes max
"Literally like 90% of the league from 2013 on would replace 90% of Jordan's era.   It would be the standouts from his league that would have to adjust. There's no one like Paul George or even a ""scrub"" like Harrison Barnes, besides Jordan."
"Hypothetical trade and something to build off, and I'm sure a 3rd team would love to get in on something like this.  Kings receive: Ben Simmons &amp; Shake Milton (Maxey if Paul forces it) 76ers receive: Davion Mitchell, Buddy Hield, Harrison Barnes &amp; Bagley (or picks)   Kings DeAron Fox (showtime with Ben), Tyrese Haliburton, ?, Ben Simmons, Holmes   76ers Maxey, Hield, Thybulle (or Barnes), Harris, Embiid  Mitchell, Curry, Green, Barnes, Niang, Drummond"
"&gt;You probably realized by now that I'm a huge Harrison Barnes stan and if you're able to pull off a 3-team trade where CJ is sent out for Harrison Barnes, I love that deal for Portland because it gives Dame a fully competent roster around him. And if that's still not enough, you've turned CJ into a contract that's much easier moved if you decide to blow it up.  As a Warriors fan.... I don't feel so good about Harrison Barnes, hahah. The issue for me is that the deal doesn't move the needle enough on their defense, and it's going to lead to the same relatively stagnant offense. If you're arguing that Barnes is more movable than Simmons, I'd say Simmons rep as an all star has the same trait.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;That doesn't really give Dame another ball-handler, but both Nurk and Harrison Barnes are underrated playmakers and combined can give you about 7-8 assists a game. I imagine too that moving away from a 3-guard lineup along with improving the bench unit would be enough to bring them up to a respectable defense.     The key here isn't having a few playmakers that share the playmaking load, it's moreso having one playmaker that the defense hyperfocuses on that can run the offense by himself sans Dame. That's usually the formula that works best, as shown by Barnes old team.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;So between us it's just a matter of what you value more; spacing + complete roster versus defense + playmaking. Also it's a matter of which trade you think would be more plausible.     It's all subjective. Thanks for the constructive criticism and calm discussion! I hear your point on Barnes and I do see your argument."
"This is where I think we diverge a bit in how to fix the Blazers and for the sake of conversation I'll elaborate. I think we both agree that the Blazers need to surround Dame with the best team they possibly can to keep him happy.   I see your points on why a Simmons trade would be beneficial, but I've always been of the idea that if you're able to trade CJ for another 3&amp;D wing then that's the best you can do. My reasoning was that CJ and assets weren't enough for another star-caliber player and none were available. That's obviously changed with Simmons, although my point in a previous post about a clogged frontcourt still stands.   You probably realized by now that I'm a huge Harrison Barnes stan and if you're able to pull off a 3-team trade where CJ is sent out for Harrison Barnes, I love that deal for Portland because it gives Dame a fully *competent* roster around him. And if that's still not enough, you've turned CJ into a contract that's much easier moved if you decide to blow it up.   That doesn't really give Dame another ball-handler, but both Nurk and Harrison Barnes are underrated playmakers and combined can give you about 7-8 assists a game. I imagine too that moving away from a 3-guard lineup along with improving the bench unit would be enough to bring them up to a respectable defense.  So between us it's just a matter of what you value more; spacing + complete roster versus defense + playmaking. Also it's a matter of which trade you think would be more plausible."
I imagine that the 76ers would want one of either Haliburton or Mitchell with the preference on Haliburton since he's a proven commodity. One of those guys would run the offense and Harrison Barnes would provide the 3&amp;D wing role.
Tbf David Lee was an All-Star power forward. Every coach aside from maybe Pop would put D Lee over draymond. But when they saw how great of a defender/floor general Draymond was that's when they decided to change the starting five. Iirc that's also when they put benched iggy for Harrison Barnes.   With Jackson tho Green was riding the end of the bench and was rarely in games.
"agreed, but 2019 gsw with harrison barnes probably beats the raptors since kd played only 12 mins in that series"
"I remember this was a few months after Harrison Barnes' poster on a much bigger Pekovic, I still say that was more difficult but Clippers were super hyped Lob City so DJ's naturally got more attention.   https://youtu.be/e2WD-exDgdU"
"You'd give Haliburton, Hield, and Harrison Barnes along with your draft picks for Simmons???"
"&gt;Your franchise was shit for a while, yet still snagged the face of the league in 2018.  &gt;Every franchise would love to be that shit.  Boo fucking hoo, life isn't fair. The earlier you accept the fact that parity is a myth the earlier you'll move on from fighting for it.   Plus you actually think LeBron would have come if Kupchak was running the show while Jeanie and Jim Buss were fighting?    &gt;And totally fleecing Memphis Grizzlies in the process.   Hope you had the same energy when Wolves got raped by the Garnett trade because McHale is a Celtics lifer and wanted to help his boy Ainge out...who ended up creating a superteam of his own.    &gt;Even Porzingis does not make Mavs a superteam. The guy is too injury prone to yield consistent results. Luka was drafted and was labeled as a ""soft white overseas euro prospect""  You swung, you missed. No one forced you to offer that shit-ass contract to a Porzingis coming out of injury. Or that shit-ass contract you gave to Harrison Barnes. Just like Kupchak giving that God-awful contract to Mozgov AND Deng. And Luka was top 2 in a lot of mock drafts, thank shitbrains Vlade for giving you Luka.    &gt;Good for you and for the league to go totally over their heads and try to give us a Nets vs. Lakers matchup.  Who's fault was Harden going to Brooklyn in the first place? Oh right, shitty team management/ownership. Hell, if Miami just gave Herro, Harden would be there.   There seems to be a trend here you're not seeing though. Bu tkeep blaming big market teams, go ahead."
"Gobert scored more points last season than guys like DeAndre Ayton, Joe Harris or Harrison Barnes, people act as if he's some kind of second coming of Ben Wallace offensively.  He's a great role player on that side, he's aware of his limited skillset but elite at everything he does."
"Bro I’ve missed probably less than twenty Warriors games since like 1998, I promise you, the Warriors would have never reached their full potential under Jackson. Even without him being a psychotic locker room cancer, he also just has zero idea how to run a modern NBA offense. Watch the Clippers and Nuggets series under him, he continually went to Harrison Barnes and David Lee in iso posts to close out games because he didn’t know how to run plays for Steph. Kerr’s motion offense is what helped Steph and Klay reach their potential  and made the best use of the slow but good passing Bogut."
&gt;no you just listed the KD lineup as if they didn't exist before that  Can you read?? I literally said “even pre-KD they had Harrison Barnes who was decent”. Do you see this sentence above - yes or no?  &gt;again...why do they need to start Wiseman or Looney only?  Because those are the two centres they have available on their roster. Who would you have them start instead?
"Lol what? No I’m not? You’re in such a rush to respond that you aren’t even reading the whole comment. I literally said:  &gt;even pre-KD they had Harrison Barnes who was decent   It’s either Looney or Wiseman starting, neither of which are floor spacers"
Surely even someone such as you can understand the difference between:  Steph/Klay/KD/Draymond/Looney  and  Steph/Klay/Simmons/Draymond/Looney  Now that you mention it I’m glad that you brought that up. When you actually type out the starting lineup they would have *three* non shooters in the starting line up as opposed to 2. Literally 3 players who are incapable of scoring the ball beyond 2 feet. Even pre-KD you had Harrison Barnes who was decent.
"I understand what made it so effective, but Barnes was an average starter and if I remember correctly was usually being used to guard Kevin Love. A man much bigger and taller than him. This wears you down. It isn't like Harrison dropped in quality for no reason, he had to bang against K Love.  Injuries happen every year to playoff teams and you MUST adjust. Lebron lost his 2 stars in 2015 so tried to utilise Mozgov as much as possible and punish the warriors with size. The Warriors had lost Steph in playoff games before and guess what, they adjusted. Now they did have a choice in this and they chose to stick with the game plan as, like you say, it had been working throughout the regular and post season. But Warriors fans throwing Barnes under the bus and acting like he is the entire reason they didn't win in 2016 is just plain wrong."
"  Wariors advance to first West finals since '76 after closing out Grizzlies  MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Stephen Curry practices tough shots every day. The MVP came up with a third-quarter buzzer-beater his coach calls the play of the game. For Golden State, rank it among the Warriors' best shots in decades, and it helped put them in their first Western Conference finals since 1976.  Curry scored 32 points with that 62-footer among eight 3-pointers, and the Warriors beat the Memphis Grizzlies a third straight game, 108-95, on Friday night.  ""In a closeout game like that, that's a big turning point and the moment's magnified,"" said Curry, the NBA's MVP. ""I made one in college like that. That's the last I made anywhere past half court and same kind of shot: loose ball, grab it, throw it up and knock it down."" First-year coach Steve Kerr called this a beautiful team win and a big moment for the Warriors. He said Curry was amazing, especially with that shot as the Grizzlies tried to make a run in the third quarter. ""It wasn't quite a closeout shot, but it was the play of the game,"" Kerr said. The Warriors advanced with some of the best shooting in the NBA postseason since 1985, becoming the first team since that year to hit 14 or more 3s in three consecutive playoff games. Curry was 8-of-13 from beyond the arc as the Warriors knocked down their playoff-best 15 3-pointers. Curry, who had 10 assists for his first double-double this postseason, hit the shot of the night after Andre Iguodala blocked Jeff Green's shot near midcourt. Curry grabbed the loose ball and beat the buzzer from the Grizzlies' 3-point line for a 76-68 lead. Klay Thompson had 20 points for Golden State, and Draymond Green added 16, Harrison Barnes 13 and Shaun Livingston 10. Memphis coach Dave Joerger said he hadn't seen the replay of Curry's shot. Grizzlies guard Mike Conley said he thought Green was fouled and that his teammates stopped playing, waiting for the call, and then Curry threw up the shot. ""It was tough to realize and kind of grasp it all in the same time,"" Conley said. The Warriors will play the winner of the Los Angeles Clippers-Houston Rockets series in the conference finals. That series will start Tuesday night at Golden State. Curry says the opponent does not matter. ""We'll obviously be watching on Sunday to figure it out,"" Curry said of the Clippers-Rockets Game 7. ""I feel like if we do what we're supposed to do in the next round, we'll be all right."" Marc Gasol led Memphis with 21 points and 15 rebounds. Vince Carter added 16 off the bench, Zach Randolph had 15, Courtney Lee 12 and Conley 11. Curry finished the series with 25 3-pointers, one more than the Grizzlies managed as a team. When he beat the buzzer with that long 3, he celebrated by bumping chests with Iguodala and David Lee. He then added 11 points in the fourth quarter to finish off the Grizzlies. ""It's just one of those special moments,"" Grizzlies guard Tony Allen said of Curry. ""He's a special kind of guy. They make those kind of shots."" That stellar shooting helped the Warriors win a second series in the same postseason for the first time since capturing the title in 1975, and they never trailed in this game. The Warriors outshot, outrebounded and simply did everything better than Memphis early, looking like the team that dominated the NBA regular season. Golden State led 32-19 by the end of the first quarter and Memphis had one more field goal (seven) than the Warriors had 3-pointers (six). The ""Splash Brothers"" outscored the Grizzlies by themselves, combining for 22 points. But Curry and Thompson got plenty of help with teammates taking turns knocking down shots. ""I think what you see with their team is I think that they really grew up,"" Joerger said. ""They really grew through the battle of this series and matured to the point where I think that will help them, unfortunately, in the future being able to take the hits that they took and the physicality that I think we are known for."" Memphis tried to rally, opening the third quarter with a 13-5 spurt with two free throws by Green pulling the Grizzlies within 63-62 with 3:59 left. Green hit a jumper to get them within 65-64 before the Warriors finished the quarter on an 11-4 run capped by Curry's amazing 3. Memphis got within eight with 6:03 left and got no closer as Curry knocked down consecutive 3s. --- TIP-INS  Warriors: Curry had been 0-for-32, 0-of-3 in the playoffs, on shots from the backcourt before his 62-footer. ... The Warriors are 13-7 all time in Game 6s and improved to 9-2 in their past 11. ... They are 54-5 this season and postseason combined when making at least 10 3-pointers, including 7-0 these playoffs. Grizzlies: Allen, who had 24 steals in his first nine playoff games, tried to play with the injured left hamstring that kept him out of Game 5. But he played only 5 minutes before going to the bench for the night, unable to move effectively. ... Memphis had only three turnovers, the fewest ever in a playoff game against Golden State. The Lakers had six on March 31, 1969, against Golden State. ... Memphis is 4-2 all time in Game 6s, losing its past two. REMEMBERING B.B. The Grizzlies played a video tribute and held a moment of silence before the national anthem in memory of musician B.B. King, who died late Thursday at the age of 89. King got his nickname early in his career playing live in Memphis as the ""Beale Street Blues Boy,"" which later was shortened to B.B."
"I’m betting on San Antonio.   I think it’ll eventually come down to CJ or a package of rotational players and picks. I think Philly will opt for the package of players to try and recoup possible future assets for a bigger trade. When it gets to that point the 3 teams I see bidding against each other are Minnesota, Sacramento, and San Antonio.   When comparing deals for these teams I’m going to assume a few guys are just off limits so those being De’Aaron Fox, Tyrese Haliburton, Karl-Anthony Towns, D’Angelo Russell, Anthony Edwards, and Dejounte Murray.   To keep everything fair for hypothetical reasons I’ll say each team trades a unprotected pick, protected pick and a swap along a starter level player, rotational player, and a player on a rookie deal. So deals of something like;  Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Taurean Prince, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 pick, 2025 swap   Derrick White, Devin Vassell, Thaddeus Young, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 1st, 2025 swap   Buddy Hield, Davion Mitchell, Marvin Bagley?, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 1st, 2025 swap.  Looking at it like this I would instantly rule out Minnesota. I think they have the worst collection of players here (outside of McDaniels I’d probably take him over Mitchell and Vassell but it’s not a large gap at all) and when it comes to future value of those picks I think they’d be a playoff team and those picks would project to be late teens to mid 20 picks. Along side that Minnesota virtually has nothing of value to add to compete against other offers other than picks, and their whole team is just consisted of 4 players.   That leaves it between Sacramento and San Antonio. To me both teams add something of value to Philly SAS gives them a Swiss Army knife half court ball handler, SAC gives them a high level floor spacer, and to me Mitchell and Vassell are equal in value and have similar skillsets despite playing different positions. I think the main swing factor here is if Sacramento throws in Harrison Barnes or not. If Harrison banes is replaced with Bagley I’ll go Sacramento without a doubt, but if not I don’t see what other quality rotational or player with value sac can really add to entice Morey (I wouldn’t take Bagley or TT over Thaddeus Young). Unlike Minnesota I think despite adding Simmons both teams could still realistically miss the playoffs which makes those draft picks more valuable, and I think both teams can take the depth hit when trading Quantity for Quality. I think even more so San Antonio can with how many players they have still on rookie deals, and if needed to they could probably throw in even more players like Walker IV or more picks like the bulls one they just got.   Did I just damn near write an essay on Ben Simmons trade destinations? Yes. Is it flawed? Probably am I bored? Also yes"
You could probably get them to throw in Harrison Barnes too.
"There's no doubt that Simmons can help every team with his defense. But it would help more in football where we can sub him out for offense :) - Like I said, the Warriors pull it off because we have a great defender in Klay that can play both sides. Steph and Klay's offense makes up for Draymond and Looney's lack of it. We can't afford another defender who can't shoot. Wiggins is really good on both sides like Harrison Barnes used to be. Back when we won 73 games."
Harrison Barnes was the real MVP.
"what the f we going to do with harrison barnes.  buddy, mitchell, and picks would be better."
"3 team trade idea that Kings fans will probably get mad about:  Golden State Warriors: Ben Simmons, Damian Jones (for salary purposes)  Philadelphia 76ers: Harrison Barnes, Buddy Hield, GSW 1st round pick  Sacramento Kings: Draymond Green, Shake Milton, Kevon Looney (for salary purposes), 2 GSW 2nd round picks  **Why the Warriors do it**:  I think everybody agrees that Ben Simmons is the best Draymond Green successor the Warriors could possibly find in terms of style of play. Everything the Warriors have done the last 2 offseasons has been about trying to extend their window of contention for as long as possible, and this move is in a similar vein. Furthermore, Draymond Green is going to suffer age related decline faster than most players, and as he gets older is going to be more of a 5 than a 4, and the Warriors remain committed to James Wiseman. This move undoubtedly makes them worse in the short term as Draymond is a better player than Ben Simmons, but the Warriors don't seem to care that much about the upcoming season, evidenced by them being very conservative with Klay.   **Why the Sixers do it**  This move is all about maximizing fit and spacing around Joel Embiid. This move unlocks Tyrese Maxey and clears the way for him to be the starting point guard. Their starting 5 becomes Maxey/Hield/Barnes/Harris/Embiid with Seth Curry a strong contender to win 6MOY. That starting 5 has lots of shooting to surround Embiid, and in Barnes, they get the wing defender to replace Simmons as well as a solid 16-18 PPG scorer, and in Hield, they get the 3-point sniper that Embiid can run the lethal DHO actions with, something he had great success with when he played with JJ Redick.   **Why the Kings do it**  Alright, I admit this one is kind of a hard sell. But hear me out. Draymond Green is still a more valuable and better player than Harrison Barnes, and is a better fit around the young backcourt that Sacramento is trying to build around with Fox and Haliburton. Sacramento was the #30 defense in the league last year by Cleaning the Glass, and they could use a still DPOY caliber player on that end of the floor, as well as a vocal leader, much more than they need Harrison Barnes' ISO scoring. Draymond can be the necessary bad cop to Luke Walton's good cop.   As for Buddy Hield, his role on the team has been marginalized with every passing year, and has been in trade rumors for years, at this point the Kings want off his contract as he is their 4th guard and they get Shake Milton from the Sixers to be said 4th guard and lead the bench along with rookie Davion Mitchell. This move does leave them light at the 3 as Terence Davis(?) becomes their starter at that position. However, they would have a lot of shot creation in their backcourt (Fox, Haliburton, Mitchell, Shake), and the requisite intelligent defensive bigs to complement them with Draymond, Holmes, and Tristan Thompson as the backup 5. They also pickup a valuable 3rd string center in Kevon Looney.  This move is made by the Kings with an eye towards trying to compete for the playoffs NOW by getting a proven leader and defensive presence in the team, and let's not forget that Draymond Green shoots 3s well when Steve Kerr is not the coach of the team, evidenced by his outrageous run at the start of the 2016 season under current Kings coach Luke Walton, and in the 2017 playoffs when Mike Brown was the interim coach."
"&gt;  Huh, they cover each other’s weaknesses perfectly.  Draymond could be paired with literally anyone and help cover their weaknesses.  KP is still a bad defender.  &gt;  KP is way too laterally slow to play the 4 next to a big 5.  You're right.  He's also too weak to play the 5, too slow in every direction to play 3, and unlike all good defensive 4's he's not switchable.  &gt;  KP before this year was actually a very good rim protector, he just needs good help defense in the pnr which draymond can provide.  That's not why he stopped being a good rim defender.  He stopped being a good rim defender because his knees are torn apart and he can't move, and he hasn't added any strength to compensate.  &gt;  On offense, dray gives luka a secondary playmaker and KP can cover for draymonds lack of shooting with his spacing.  Yeah, KP's spacing helps Dray.  That's really the only benefit to pairing them.  Frankly, Luka plays off ball so little I genuinely don't know if he's good off ball.  In terms of cuts, he doesn't have much quickness, but he's as smart as they come with good instincts so I'm sure he could be good this way.  &gt;  They give Dallas the flexibility to run KP as the 4 and Dray as the 5 on offense and then switch to KP as the 5 and Dray as the 4 on defense.  You can't really start Dray at the 5.  It's good in small doses for small ball, but the amount of energy it takes for him to play 5 means we typically only played our death squad or Hamptons 5 (our Harrison Barnes and KD small ball sets) a maximum of 10 minutes in any given game.  The basic problem is this:  KP can't move well enough to guard anyone outside of 10 feet, and he gets bullied at the rim.  Luka is barely a positive defender because he's sharp and strong, but he also lacks lateral movement.  The Mavs two biggest problems were that they had 2-3 people on the court at any given time who could get barbecued in the iso, and that they had the same people who couldn't switch onto other players.  Your offense, especially when you had Seth Curry instead of Josh Richardson, was terrifying.  But the basic idea is that if you guys are able to survive Jason Kidd's coaching, you desperately need a versatile defensive 4 who can maybe hit a 3 at a decent clip."
Sure but who are the Kings signing on a max deal to join their core? Fox is signed. Holmes is signed. Hali and Mitchell aren't extention eligible for a couple of seasons.   You get rid of Hield's contract as well. Essentially you're paying $15 million a year more for Harris than you would for Hield. The only thing I see is Harrison Barnes leaving and Harris is an upgrade.   A Mitchell/Fox/Hali/Harris/Holmes core for the next 3 years sounds like a win to me.
"Minnesota: I'm still confident that this has to be a 3-team trade in which Philly actually gets a star. I'm confident that Minny can use a bunch of picks as leverage, but it'd take a ton and it also requires somebody big wanting out.  GSW: Lol no  Sacramento: I'm tired of people trying to scream a Bagley/Hield trade into existence because that's obviously a super poor return for Simmons.  If Philly does try to engage with Sacramento, they need to be walking away with *at least* a combination of Haliburton and Harrison Barnes. I don't even think that's a great return for Philly, but they'd need a ball handler and wing defender back."
"Nobody's talking about this, but the 76ers would want Harrison Barnes.   A package build around Barnes and one of either Mitchell/Haliburton isn't the return that Philly would want, but it makes sense."
"Simmons potential value reminds me exactly of Wiggins and how he used his ""potential"" to get a supermax when it was pretty clear the most he might grow into is a better Harrison Barnes. Every single year people would wonder if Wiggins will break out, because he has the tools the length and athleticism to be like Simmons on defense at least, but always lacked the mental component."
"There's a difference between preferring to keep a player, and a player being untouchable.  HB is a ""prefer to keep him if possible"" for the reasons you stated.  But he's not untouchable.  If he's untouchable, then every positive role player on a squad is untouchable.  Untouchable is a player that you build the entire foundation of a team on.  Harrison Barnes sure as hell is not that.  Fox is that.  Hali, debatable but I can see why Kings' fans think he's the future of the franchise.  HB is not in that conversation."
"Harrison Barnes is the only true forward we have and wants to be in Sacramento. If we traded him, we’d just be back a square one with a major hole in our line up, without having Hield too.  A starter and 3 FRP is more than enough for Simmons, but like I said, I think a 3rd team needs to get involved because Philly still needs a starting point guard."

The rules buffed Harrison Barnes
I think the narrative of Harrison Barnes leading the Kings to a playoff berth after a 15 year drought sounds good.
"Also a B looks like 8. Bogdanovics jersey number is 8, Bjelicas jersey number is also 8 or 88 with the kings. Hields jersey number is 24 or 2x4 equals 8. Finally, Harrison Barnes jersey number is 40, but if you subtract how many playoff games the kings will win this year (16) you get 24. 2x4 equals 8."
"I mean I think we a have a legit 7-8 man rotation. By legit I mean everyone in it has a serviceable NBA skill. Just going by guards we have Halliburton, Fox, Hield, and Davion. We’re admittedly thin on the wing and terrence davis is not helping at all so far, but Harkless has been solid and Barnes is playing out of his mind. Inside Holmes has been great but gets in foul trouble, so Alex Len has been great for us so far. But yeah we are a Harrison Barnes or Holmes injury away from being in big trouble."

"&gt; This gets talked about but not enough the Nets trading for 2 months of Gerald Wallace the pick that became Dame  this one irritates me to no end because we had traded Gerald for two late 1sts and filler the previous year. Those picks became #19 in 2011 (packaged with Stephen Jackson to move up to #7 for Bismack Biyombo, and #24 in 2014, which became PJ Hairston in its own draft day trade.  Had we waited a year to trade Gerald, I don't think Lillard would've been drafted here one season after Kemba, that pick likely becomes Drummond or Harrison Barnes. But still..."
Harrison Barnes will be a star
"&gt; Harrison Barnes is top 5 in FTA per game, higher than James Harden, Trae Young and Joel Embiid.  Rudy Gobert is top 1 lol"
"- Harrison Barnes is top 5 in FTA per game, higher than James Harden, Trae Young and Joel Embiid.  - Kyle Kyzma is top 5 in RPG (rebounds per game), higher than his former teammate Anthony Davis.   - Kevin Porter Jr. is averaging 6.3 turnovers per game to start the season, by far the league leader in this category."
You don't even need an all time great.  Give them fucking Harrison Barnes and they still win 2/4.
"""Wiggins isn't even a great 3rd option.""  Many third options don't get 15+ ppg. Not even Harrison Barnes could do that even with Curry's unanimous season. Curry is covering up one weakness of Wiggins and that is his inability to play freely. Wiggins needs a defined role, you tell him to defend his heart and you will get a game like the Lakers where he absolutely defends Lebron like his life depends on it( absolutely shutting him down in the 4th.) Also, did Wiggins not step up by putting the  game out of reach that both Poole and Curry couldn't. Consider me crazy but, Wiggins is a great third option when you know what you want from him"
Don’t have my PC in front of me. Who are the culprits for high MPG over the same timespan? Harrison Barnes? Russ? Who else.
"Yeah, that Cavs team was historic offensively. . Problem was, you guys essentially traded Harrison Barnes for Kevin Durant and kept everyone else. We had no shot."
"exactly. as of right now, harrison barnes is averaging 28 points. ja is averaging 35 and 8 assists. people need to stop comparing stats in the first week"
"I think pretty easy to match a $20m player like Jerami Grant, Harrison Barnes, Caris Levert, etc.   Obviously, you'd hope to get a player better than that. But I don't think salary matching is that hard for a mid-tier player."
"I'd argue that it's a different scenario - The Cavs and the Heat had to put together a team from scratch while adhering to salary cap rules. This meant that initially they didn't have much dept and had to build that over time by signing veterans on minimums... Both the Heat, the Cavs and now the Lakers have some of the oldest average roster ages because of this.  The Warriors were able to sign Durant in the summer when the salary cap jumped due to the new TV deal. Suddenly they basically had enough room to sign another max player if they whisked away Harrison Barnes... and they did. Had it been any other year, they could not have signed Durant without giving up more key pieces (and thus kept the league fair)... but they didn't.  Sure you could argue that the salary cap jump is not the Warriors doing and they were just taking advantage of it, but in reality it's the cause of a poorly negotiated CBA (rather than be a bump, it should have been smoothed out over a number of years) and probably won't happen again."
I see him as a combination of Scottie Pippen and Harrison Barnes
"You guys went 12-1 during the playoffs on the way to the finals, they were a much better team than the year before. Paying Harrison Barnes max money to brick 3s was not going to top that 2016-2017 cavs team"
It was a continuation of a conversation where they said Harrison Barnes was going to beat Gobert in iso
"Harrison Barnes, Miles Bridges, Hero, CJ, Seth, Bane and Reddish ""monstarred"" them.  Except Dlo, they left him alone."
"Lebron, Russell Westbrook, AD, Carmelo Anthony, Rajon Rondo, Dwight Howard, Deandre Jordan  Vs.  Curry, Klay, Draymond, Iggy, Harrison Barnes  Why is that questionable?"
"The players who knows that they'll get max contract offers from 5+ teams can do whatever they like. Harden would've get that max deal from any team and AD would get it from 20 teams. (Any team would've opened cap space if they knew Harden was signing with them).  So for Simmons, people acting, saying he's a limited player is non-sense. Simmons is an all-star, great defender and decent on offense for the most part of the season. This combination makes him so valuable and that is the reason Morey is not trading him.   Harrison Barnes cant do that because he doesn't know if he can command a max contract. But Simmons can do this."
Fair enough. Shout-out Harrison Barnes. He’s definitely contributing as well to the NBPA
Harrison Barnes is the Secretary-Treasurer
I was saying this the other day. Trading away Harrison Barnes for cap space (which we never used) was a huge mistake.
Funny enough I think Harrison Barnes would be really good for y’all
I dont know about JA and Trae...  but I know Harrison Barnes is the new GOAT - 28 ppg 10 reb  68% TS !
"A team that nobody has mentioned yet is the Kings. I didn't realize until the game last night, but they have put together a really awesome lineup.   Fox is awesome to watch, just super quick.  Haliburton &amp; Mitchell are going to be good players in the league for a while  Harrison Barnes used to be on the warriors and he's just continued to get better with SAC. His shot is so much better now and his %'s reflect it  Hield is one of the best shooters in the league, shoots like Steph, big like Klay or whatever  Richaun Holmes seems underrated, good touch around the basket, gets boards, good fit for the team.   Idk, I never really watch the Kings except for when it's vs. the warriors, but I really like their squad this year. Wouldn't be surprised to see them battling for the playoffs this year or next"
The best part of [this highlight of Gobert shutting down Harrison Barnes](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=692&amp;GameID=0022100026&amp;Season=2021-22&amp;flag=1&amp;title=MISS%20Hield%2031%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&amp;sct=plot) is that the commentators were still talking about how Harrison Barnes was going to beat Gobert off the dribble *while he was shutting him down*

It was nice to see Harrison Barnes play like it was game 7 of the finals.
Harrison Barnes.
Harrison Barnes????
Harrison Barnes
LOL harrison barnes with the airball
"Nah not hating lol. It's just that anthony edwards is now 6'6, and one of the most athletic players in the league who is buckets. He's going to need the ball in his hand more.   Might cash in with dlo and get a 3 off ball decent defensive capable player like Harrison Barnes,   the hawks having alot of forwards,   Orlando having Cole Anthony, and mo bamba. (Kat not good paint defender)   Feel like the pelicans would be the type to trade ingram for dLo if the Timberwolves put a pic in there.   cam Johnson on the suns since cp3 is not getting any younger and dLo and Booker are BFF."
Umm who wouldn’t take Harrison Barnes over him? lol
morris can fuck right off with his iso midranges if he’s gonna continue with his inconsistent shooting ass   i’ll taken harrison barnes over him man fuck
That loss to the kings had Harrison Barnes going goku
Harrison Barnes is more of a sure thing than Cade too
Harrison “5%” Barnes is not an elite role player
So you don't consider Warriors Harrison Barnes and Mikal Bridges from last year ELITE role players?
"Harrison Barnes/Mikal Bridges type. If Reddish can become an above average 3 and D guy and the Hawks are making deep runs every year, I think they are the winners of the trade."
"Our current iteration of Harrison Barnes would be so good with Luka- he’s literally everything the Mavs are missing right now and they gave him up for Justin Jackson, lol."
"I'd trade westbrick for buddy hield and Harrison Barnes in a heartbeat if I could, also a terrible fit on the lakers with their lack of spacing, we all know russ is only usable if there's 4 shooters around him not on a team with non shooters like rondo, dwight, or DJ. Also one of the worst off ball players in the league so a huge negative with guys like LBJ and AD being so ball dominant. Still have no idea why Pelinka traded for him to this day when there were many better options available in terms of fit but I guess lakers higher ups only care about big names and former players."

Traded Mid game like [Harrison Barnes](https://youtu.be/CX5vNqKkGhs)
Harrison Barnes with a quiet 25/14 lol
Harrison Barnes is ice cold.
"Harrison Barnes would be the perfect fit on clippers, he is like a god version of Batum"
"Not true. The trade gave us the ability to sign randle who was all nba. Also gave us the ability to sign Marcus Morris who we traded for the pick that got us IQ. Quickly was big for us last season and might be our second most valuable young asset.    KP when healthy doesn't exist anymore. Hasn't for years. And KPs playoff ejection was him being rooked by Marcus Morris (a player that would be great next to Luka, and could have been acquired if not for the trade).    And Luka made it that far DESPITE the trade. Not because of it. If the mavs had Luka, curry, Harrison Barnes, Morris , and nerlens noel they would be a better team imo. And all of those are players they let walk away(except Morris who they could have signed)"
I'm guessing he didn't see Harrison Barnes put up 36 against the Trailblazers. The league really should force the 6ers and Kings to trade the two disgruntled players in Bagley and Simmons. 6ers also get Harrison Barnes and Hield...Should've been done weeks ago.
"Same reason Kerr started Harrison Barnes over Iguodala on the '15 and '16 Warriors.  The purpose is to put the best team on the floor at all times, NOT to start your best five players.   Taking one of your best players out of the starting lineup makes it easier to balance your lineups over the course of the game.   Lots of coaches can't do that because of player ego. ""Starting"" is deeply ingrained as meaning ""one of the best guys on the team."""
"Steph Curry, Paul George, Lebron followed by Jalen Brown and Harrison Barnes."
8 made threes? Those are Harrison Barnes numbers!
"&gt;We need to get a player near Ben's level in order to be a better team than we are now without Ben.  No you don’t. His flaws and lack of fit with your best player makes it so you’d be a way better playoff team with Wiggins, or Harrison Barnes, straight up."
Harrison Barnes
get harrison barnes and westbrook vaccinated too
"Well to be fair, Harrison Barnes was possessed by the devil"
"Bullshit. Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, and Rajon Rondo are all on the active roster.  That right there is more star power than the entire Kings team, meanwhile we're missing Harrison Barnes and (much less importantly) Marvin Bagley."
Scottie Pippen and Harrison Barnes’ son looking good
"In 5 years they drafted three All-NBA players, and Harrison Barnes, who is a very solid player. They won a ring with that core, along with a finals trip and a 73-9 season. I think they're perfectly happy"
"If racism is the only reason why he's being painted as the villain in this situation, wouldn't that apply to any black player? Do you believe this sub thinks all black players are bad guys?  If Steph Curry or Harrison Barnes were rhe guys who hit Jokic first, you believe this sub would have reacted exactly the same?  I don't believe that's the case, personally."
Seth Curry for J-Broke and Harrison Barnes for a pack of chips and Justin Jackson
we lost to the kings at home and we had the big three and they where missing their best player this season in harrison barnes and a good center in richaun holmes.this is going to be another close nail baiter
"Dejounte Murray, Tyler hero , Harrison Barnes, Og, DeAndre ayton.   Bench. Jonas, Mikal bridges, lonzo, MO bamba, Cole Anthony."
"Ja Morant  Lou Dort  Mikal Bridges  OG Anunoby  Myles Turner  Bench - Buddy Hield, Harrison Barnes, Lonzo, LaMelo, Ayton.  Starting lineup emphasizes defense.  Dort, Bridges and OG are all elite defender and can guard 1-4.  Turner is an elite rim protector and capable 3 point shooter.   Offense emphasizes a spread 3 point attack, led by Ja attacking the paint/mismatches and either scoring or passing out.  LaMelo is the secondary play maker off the bench while everyone else are catch and shoot or catch and drive players."
"Everyone is overvaluing tht at the moment, every Lakers trade thread is like oh tht is the asset  He's scoring 11ppg on 38% shooting  The Lakers actually think they're going to package him and some 2075 pick for Harrison Barnes or someone similar tier?  No I don't think so"
I think just not having Harrison Barnes as his team mate nullifies most of the problems with that series.
"Where’s the lie…  Can you even name a marquee signing the Nuggets have had via free agency? They have to keep/overpay for their talent, every single small market does (See: Gobert 190 mil/ Thunder Westbrook deal/ etc)  Same thing when the kings were clowned for “overpaying” for Harrison Barnes two years ago. Should they have simply signed Lebron or KD instead?"
"There isnt any valid argument. People saying jokic giannis kd are at his level are biased. I dont know how many ring he need to win, how many record to broke, how many teammates he needs to boost his level….  Is a gravity machine like the league has never seen. A fucking black hole. Steph plus 4 random nba players make a team. Giannis with 4 randoms? He cant shoot, is a beast is both ends but he doesnt make everyone better, he needs shooters around, steph doesnt need anything just nba quality players around and he makes them look like fucking all stars.  Some dumb people answered in that topic: place jokic kd giannis with klay… please he is not even playing. And as good as klay is, how good is his leagacy without steph? Imagine klay on pistons rockes hornets…  Steph makes looney from average to good, makes poole from random to 3p god, made harrison barnes look like all star, makes draymon from a complete all around player to all star ( draymon in any other team isnt all star in his life) and makes klay from all star level to superstar level.  Also, changed the game, the way its played. Jordan was the best on his era. Kobe on his era. James on his era. But who changed the rules and evolved the game of basketball? Chamberlain and steph, the difference is steph did in a more professional and harder era. His only problem is he is athletic but not by nba standars and is not very tall so people thinks is an average dude you can find in the streets that just shoot pretty well and cant defend ehem ehem… and with tons of different stats and metrics people try to claim he is not the best and usually forgets 1 thing: that game is about who SCORES 1 point more, not who is better 2way player, or who rebound more, or who can dunk oreos better or more easily because is a freak god, is who is better at scoring. Basketball is an offensive game where offense always have the advantage over defense , assuming both are equaliy good at his respective roles. And i saw a lot of god scores like kobe iverson james durant harden… but nobody generates an 5 man offense on his own as steph, just by breathing on the court with his insane range and gravity is making 4 players better. Someoe said the same about messi. He walks instead run and still is positive for his team. Steph is the most underrated player of the nba by far. And got robbed 2 mvps. Iguodala didint play better than him. And kd had better stats but steph generated all pressure and gravity and is the piece that makes the warriors unbeatable. You cant change hin for any player. Any other top player in his team and he barely makes playoffs on the west. His teammates except klay who didnt play in 2 years are at most average. Tell me giannis or kd could make wiggins look good? Please……They just look godly cuz they play with the best player of his era who draws 3 players defending at half court.   He changed basketball"
"GIRL, 💁🏼 he 👑👨 might’ve 🅱🤔 broke my 👨💪 heart once before but I’m stronger 💪💪 now 👇👎 than 🅰😽 Harrison 😎😂 Barnes will 😮 ever 🚪🚶 know"
"Possible and probable are two different things. Surround Jokic with   Lonzo   Jrue   Mikal  Draymond   and they’ll easily have a great/elite defense in the playoffs. Will it be perfect? No. Will they maybe have to do a lot of scrambling and play frantically? Sure. But they’ll be more than enough to win a chip.   Is that team easy to assemble? Nah, but neither were the 2017 Warriors or the 2021 Nets. Teams can get stacked with talent in the blink of an eye. And it doesn’t even have to be those exact players. Swap Dray with Anthony Davis and swap Mikal with Harrison Barnes. Still good enough? Yep. Swap Jrue with old Lowry? Still good enough? I think so.   And there’s gonna be emerging two way role players as time goes on. Jokic is young. He could move teams in a couple years and team up with some guys who aren’t even known as two-way players rn"
"Ever since the Warriors were a contender Steph was never a defensive liability. He was just the weakest defender on the floor closing games out of Harrison Barnes, KD, Klay, Andre, Dray, Livingston, Looney, and/or Bogut. Of course he got attacked.  And of course it didn't look good when it was Lebron James attacking him. If you'd swapped him with prime CP3 the same thing would have happened to CP3 too."
Fully healthy Warriors? I think they'd take it. Looking at the depth charts:  Steph + Livingston &gt; Kyrie + any other Cavs guard  Klay + Barbosa &gt; Iman Shumpert + J.R. Smith   Harrison Barnes + Iguodala &lt; LeBron + Jefferson  Draymond + McAdoo = Love + Derrick Williams  Bogut + Speights/Ezeli ≥ Thompson + Channing Frye  You're relying on LeBron to make up for disadvantage at 2 or 3 other positions. I think that's too much.
"Yeah look back at the first title run. If Curry shoots 20 3s a game the analytics say they'd have done even better, but guys like Harrison Barnes and Igoudala and Livingston really needed to have touches because Steph won't go off every single game and they took a big load in the offense sometimes."
tobias harris and harrison barnes!
"""Harrison Barnes wanted to be a young socialite so we gave him to the Kings."""
lol thought they wanted Harrison Barnes at first
"I still feel like they should try to upgrade from Crowder by going after maybe Harrison Barnes (kings prob won’t trade him), Jerami Grant, or Christian Wood (idk if he’d fit next to Ayton)  What do y’all think?"
"“Hey Ty, just checking in on how you’re doing man. Congrats on the championship, by the way we just replaced Harrison Barnes with Kevin Durant for free. Anyway gotta go bro”"
"Steph was being fouled off ball every play. The Cavs even admitted that their game plan was to foul him off ball as much as possible because they knew it wasn't being called.  And of course you can still blame it on missing another starter. The game came down to the last minute of game 7. You really think having your starting center, best PnR guy, and best rim protector wouldn't have made the difference?  I mean, there are a litany of things that went wrong during that series, if we want to list them. Harrison Barnes literally forgot how to make a bucket. He shot like 19% from the 3. Almost half as well as he had been shooting previously. That would have made the difference. Iggy not having a hurt back could have made the difference. Hell, Steph not injuring his knee earlier in the playoffs may have made the difference.   But, for me, the most blatant missing piece was our starting center. You can't play Anderson Varejao and Festus Ezeli as your centers in games 6 &amp; 7, and expect a great outcome."
"Didn't they almost make the playoffs 2 or 3 years ago? I think that was Joerger's last stint as head coach, when the team still had Shumpert but traded him midseason for Harrison Barnes. Thought they were doing well, idk why they bottomed out by the end of that season."
"Oh totally, it’s why NBA GMs/executives do what they do and we just talk about it.  It’s one thing to point out a hole in a team / thought / ideology / mechanism / whatever. It’s a whole other beast to recognize that flaw, then have the ability to remedy that weak point without creating more gaps or issues for the whole.  I can sit here and say the Suns need a player like PJ Tucker, Draymond Green as a PF (or even Bembry). Or say they need a Bogdanovic, Seth Curry, Danny Green as a SG. Or a Harrison Barnes, OG Anounoby, Norman Powell at SF. But how can they do that without giving up the things that make them good / or creating more holes?  That I don’t know."
"You mean if DeAaron Fox, Tyrese Haliburton , Buddy Hiele, and Harrison Barnes joined a team with 15 straight wins? I think they’d be pretty good lol"
"I sort of agree, but it's not like KD went to the Bay because he liked the weather. He went because (speculation) he was tired of OKC's non-shooter having-asses, and Russ going my turn your turn Iso ball. Also because the Warriors were pretty fucking good at basketball.  Also, even if they didn't get KD they could've signed Harrison Barnes or whoever the next best SF/PF free agent was and been pretty fucking good, still. KD did them a solid and did the sign-and-trade since it allowed the Nets to go over the cap to sign him and Kyrie, and they wanted to get DeAndre 10M for some reason."
"He's a diva for sure, but he's also won 4 rings in that time, and it could have been 5 or 6 if GS hadn't been able to replace Harrison Barnes with fucking KD."
"They actually chose not to resign Harrison Barnes, and used that salary space for KD which turned into Wiggins. That slot was always meant for a max/near-max SF, if they didn't have Durant, they would've still had Barnes."
"OT against the Kings without Harrison Barnes. If Barnes was playing, I think the Kings actually win it outright."
"It doesn't have to be a mental thing, the playoffs are just a small sample size. Guys go on hot and cold streaks all the time.  Derek Fisher shot 52% 3pt in the 2001 playoffs. There wasn't any bubble, he just got on a hot streak at the same time it happened to be the playoffs. 8n 2002 he shot 36% 3pt in the playoffs, then in 2003 he shot 62% 3pt in the playoffs. All those years were normal years, no lockouts or anything like that.  In 2015 Harrison Barnes shot 42% 3pt in the Finals. In 2016 he dropped to 31% 3pt. It wasn't because he got weaker mentally, it's just that 2 series a year apart are going to have some variance."
"&gt; That article offering so little hope for the future of the team is really what makes it such a great read  Absolutely. It's interesting because the seeds for success are planted at the end of the article, but Simmons just assumes the Warriors are going to screw everything up - Steph getting drafted, Klay getting drafted, the lottery pick that was blatantly tanked into the top 7 protection and Harrison Barnes, the trade for an injured Bogut...  The pieces were coming together but no one, not even the most delusional of Warriors fans, saw the dynasty coming."
Replace KD? The warriors won 73 games with Harrison Barnes.
No Richaun Holmes or Harrison Barnes either.
Sixers are gonna take Harrison Barnes and they’re gonna like it.
If Harrison Barnes were here he would have hit the game winner already.  Don't ask me how I know :(
And yeah over fucking Harrison Barnes lmfao stop it rn they are averaging  around the same except wigs is on the better team and better defense by a mile gtf on somewhere
Wiggs over Donovan Mitchell?  Wiggs over Ja Morant (assuming he's healthy)  Wiggs over Harrison Barnes?  Wiggs over Dejounte Murray?  Wiggs over KP?
Shoutout to KD for letting the sign and trade happen when he decided to leave.  We ended up with a &lt; KD  but  &gt; Harrison Barnes player in Wiggins.
"For the forward spot you got LeBron/AD/Draymond/PG13.  For the wildcards, Donovan Mitchell, Booker, Harrison Barnes, SGA, Fox are all up there. Its tuff."
"If he can shoot his patented midrange on a consistent basis on respectable volume, then yeah I'd put him at all star status. He's just between 2016 Regular Season Harrison Barnes and KD"
"no harrison barnes and richaun holmes, even"
Have not been watching Lakers games this season....can Lakers fans explain to me this Benny Hill dumpster fire when you have Lebron/AD/Russ and Kings dont have Harrison Barnes or Holmes tonight?
Suns were just 3-4 plays from winning the whole thing last season so I'm not surprised. They're a great team that this sub disrepsected too much.  Could be 16 in a row right now if Harrison Barnes didn't hit a crazy game winner.
"IMO the one surprise I could think of was Harrison Barnes.  There were times he tried to take over when Steph or Klay should have, it seemed like he had an inferiority complex and thought he was on even terms with Steph, and management (and the fanbase) wanted him to take a team discount which he obviously didn't do.  Plus there was the whole disappearing in the Finals."
"It was really Brooklyn since by that point they were either in their final season playing in NJ or their first season in Brooklyn.   Plus the Nets had D.Will before his ankles went south so it’s not like he wanted to join the Nets all by himself and build something.   Unfortunately for Nets fans we had to deal with the Dwight-mare shortly after the Melo-drama before the Nets traded for D.Will after Melo went to the Knicks.    Another unfortunate thing was D.Will not leaving for Dallas as a Free Agent since the Nets had Goran Dragic lined up to take the PG spot when D.Will was on the fence on a 5yrs Max in Brooklyn vs a 4yr in Dallas.   One of the worst parts of missing out on Dwight Howard was Billy King in a panic move sending a 1st to Portland for Gerald Wallace who was already seeing a decline and was then overpaid just to stay. Nets did that with the hopes of re signing D.Will by showing they were all in on winning.    Nets would have most likely drafted Harrison Barnes since they needed SF depth because at the time it was like 4vs5 when they were on Offense from how poor the SF production was.   If the Nets didn’t trade for Wallace and draft Barnes do the Warriors draft the hometown kid Damian Lillard with the next pick? This was before Curry took that next step and was on that cheap contract he signed because of his sketchy ankles.   Warriors could have easily ran Lillard, Curry, and Klay at the 1-3 spot. May have impacted them signing Durant as a FA since I think they needed to let Barnes leave in order to open up enough cap space."
"We're well over the cap and Ben is signed for the next 4 years. If we settle for something like a Harrison Barnes in exchange because ""at least it's better than Ben not playing"", we're now fully married to that package because otherwise we're unable to do anything during the remainder of Embiid's prime. If Ben decides not to play this season, we can consider it a lost season, but his ass will be back next season because we'll have called his and Rich Paul's bluff.   Simmons and Paul are gambling on the fact that we won't let this season go by without Ben stepping foot on the court. Because Ben is collecting fines from the Sixers despite already getting paid (remember when ""Ben would never show up"", then suddenly he's there because it became obvious he wasn't getting paid due to the escrow account?), he and Paul are gambling HARD on Ben getting traded to another team and just never paying the fines because the other team won't hold him accountable for those fines. If he doesn't play this year and he doesn't pay the fines, next year's contract goes in escrow again, and you can bet your ass that the Sixers just straight pull out all the money he was fined when Simmons doesn't play. More than he wants to not play for the Sixers, the Young Socialite wants his money."
"Watching jokic climb up the ranks of nba players, it blows my mind how he just dominates 7 fters these days. Then you see him on a 6'8 player like Harrison Barnes and he makes it look like Barnes is 6'1"" lol. Just backs him down in 3 seconds and shoots over him with that high release/floater"
"Warriors already have Juan Toscano Anderson who is basically a poor man's Draymond Green clone. They don't need a max slot dedicated to another backup for Draymond Green. If they are gonna dump Wiggins and Wiseman they need an *upgrade* at the 3, which at the bare minimum would be a Harrison Barnes level player. Not Simmons who won't shoot and just stands at the dunker spot in the playoffs."
"harrison barnes last 3 years: 14.4, 14.6, 16.1... sorry hes a 15 ppg player on the back end of his career. off by 2 points... super bullshit disingenuous though. barnes is making 20 mil, so any trade this year they would have to take a bad contract back anyway in addition to picsk, which will be from contenders. So not good return for him at all and doesn't fit the timeline. Honestly I really don't think denver makes that trade so it doesnt even matter.  I was looking ahead to two years from now. not saying he'll be out for two years. The only information I could find about his timeline was a random reporter speculating he could be out for the season. Its pretty disingenuous of you to assume in this arguement he would be out for 2 whole years when almost no injury takes someone out that long.  But his last year performance does matter in this instance. Considering he  could potentially play another 10 years and in his second season put up numbers to match barnes best ever year of his career. Fuck me right."
"In this scenario he would be 25, lost two years of development, and have no guarantee that he’s anywhere close to the player he was pre-injury  Also such a bullshit disingenuous statement to call Barnes a 13 ppg player considering he hasn’t averaged 13 or less in over 8 years, not sure why you would frame MPJ’s stats using just last year but not this year where he was disappointing while at the same time using Barnes’ entire career including his time with the warriors where his averages would obviously be lower.   &gt; If this was last year and people found out the Kings offered harrison barnes one for one for MPJ they would be laughing harder than the moery trade offers.  You already on the answer to why the consensus has shifted, but you somehow can’t put it together yourself."
"Yea, its a risk, I literally wrote that in my comment lol.  last year MPJ averaged 20pts 7rebs per game in 31 mins. Harrison Barnes doesn't at all fit the timeline and a max is not even that unusual for a guy putting up 20 and 7. Harrison barnes is a career 13ppg player.  Are you honestly saying you don't even think about picking up a 23yr old with allstar to superstar potential in a one to one for a 13ppg player whos in year 10?"
"I really think the Sixers should strongly consider a deal centered around Harrison Barnes and Buddy Hield for Danny Green and Simmons. Both great shooters and Barnes seems to be solid defensively (correct me if I'm wrong). Imagine a being able to roll out a lineup of Seth Curry, Hield, Niang, and Barnes with Embiid at center. Absolutely insane spacing.  In fact, the Kings should be the ones to reject this trade with how low Simmon's trade value is getting. But if the offer is on the table, Sixers have to take it imo. I think with the emergence of Maxey they would be fine not getting Fox."
Where do yall think Harrison Barnes ends up at the deadline?
3-and-D wing all the way. Harrison Barnes would be the pipe dream
"De’Aaron Fox fell off hella hard. He might not even be a top ten PG this season. Also, our defense is still not great and Harrison Barnes has cooled off after carrying us in the beginning of the season"
The Harrison Barnes buzzer beating game winner woke them up
Harrison Barnes
"I disagree. I feel like you are looking at body types way too much. He hasn't shown LBJ type of playmaking ability ever. He reminds me more of Harrison Barnes (play off catch, up and unders and post work) than Iggy or LBJ."
Harrison Barnes
"Thanks for the ^disappointing insight! I remember hearing about Lou King when he was at Oregon, then noticed he was on a two-way with the Pistons, but even they let him go, so I figured he wasn't ready at all. Glad to hear he might eventually become something.  I kind of wish the Kings just played these guys more. Screw trying to win, go full 2020-2021 Thunder with their Maledon, Bazley, Poku, Roby, Moses Brown lineups. Stop playing Harkless 20 minutes, keep Harrison Barnes and Buddy Hield fresh in case they might get traded, trade or cut TT (13 MPG), maybe ship out Len (16 MPG), and give big minutes to Metu, Ramsey, Woodard, Queta, and King along with Fox, Haliburton, Mitchell, and Holmes. Go for some big picks in future drafts because this ain't it. Heck, even play Bagley big minutes if he doesn't sit out like Ben Simmons.  They need to find out who might work well with their main young core pieces and if they don't, then they either need to spend some time in the G-league or off the team. Rotate in other G-league guys on temp contracts to see if anyone sticks and flip guys between the NBA and G-league (the Jazz did a few times to get our guys reps). Go full process except without the blatant tanking. It's probably better than what y'all have had to endure these last 15 years."
agreed but it’s also about fit. Schroeder has been a perfect fit around them cause he provides smt the jays lack which is the ability to get most of your points driving and drawing fouls. Kemba was a pull-up shooter who couldn’t play a lick of d which made him such a hot and cold player. It’s amazing they got the production they did out of him seeing how bad he is this year. Al can fit with anyone. I think they are a forward and a shooter away from being a real contender. Think Harrison Barnes type
Harrison Barnes had legit value &amp; the kings decided to stay put. They don’t know when to trade man.
We would presumably get Harrison Barnes as well. Buddy is just a bench piece
"Westbrook is pretty much stuck there and they don’t have any good firsts they can trade. You’re swapping old vets for other old vets. That’s going to be a downgrade with them having to now integrate into the system themselves. Ofc there is hope they can trade THT, an expiring contract, and that 2027 first for maybe a role player like Terrence Ross. If they are lucky they can get a guy like Myles Turner or Harrison Barnes/Hield but let’s be honest. If the Pacers/Kings call more than 3 teams they are getting a better offer than that."
I want Lakers fans to explain to me how they are trading him for Harrison Barnes or jeremi grant please
This is the problem with an ageing team though. It would be better if the Lakers packaged THT and sent him to the kings for Harrison Barnes.
Either or....I like Harrison Barnes and I think he still gets a bad rap for game 7 (he's been great on the kings) but he's not better than Sabonis as a fourth guy. Like I agree with your take but in hindsight the Thunder were just a better all around team.
"""Joe Harris stole my bit!"" -Harrison Barnes"
"Also every single trade they've made otherwise since getting Luka was a bad deal. Obviously we all hated the Seth/JRich trade, but we all seem to forget trading away Harrison Barnes for JUSTIN JACKSON.   Imagine the core of Luka, Seth, THJ, HB and KP. All on the team together and then Donnie was like nah fuck quality we want ~flexibility~"
"EZ fix, just let Harrison Barnes take 20 shots a game."
"Shooting from the hip, but does a Harrison Barnes and Buddy Hield based package make sense for the Sixers?"
"barnes is having the best season of his career, he's in his prime right now  he also gives you a veteran championship winning presence.  he was a big player on that 73-9 win warriors team.   he got a lot of minutes that season he was a big reason why they won so many games.   but he was young at the time, he's only now reaching his peak  having too many good wings is never a problem, they already have depth issues at that position with danny green missing time due to injuries  talk about fit all you want if they got harrison barnes he would be a productive player for them immediately and when they get healthier as a team he would make them even better than they were when they went 9-2.   he's definitely better than georges niang  I mean I don't want them to get barnes because it's better for me if the sixers arent that good, but he's by far the best piece they could get from the kings in order to improve their team"
Who is better Harrison Barnes or Andrew Wiggins?
Harrison Barnes could be filthy with Philly.
Who’s the kings 3rd best player since the Kevin Martin era after Fox and Cousins? Is it really Tyreke Evans lol. Harrison Barnes coming for the throne soon
"Hopefully by some miracle the Lakers can do a Westbrook to the Kings for maybe Harrison Barnes or Boddy Hield. But tbh anything would be beneficial, except Bagley."
Trade Harrison Barnes to a good team please
"especially since maxey just looks better than fox does, philly already has great guard depth even with simmons sitting out  maxey, curry, korkmaz, thybulle, shake milton  you can sacrifice some of these guys minutes to give some to fox but is it really worth it.   i'd rather have harrison barnes"
"they would be incredibly lucky to get a guy of harrison barnes' caliber back in that trade let alone both barnes + hield  harrison barnes is awesome, he's finally reached his prime"
"eh I dont think fox would really be good for us, rather have tyrese or harrison barnes or richaun holmes"
and two of them were meaningless harrison barnes free throws
Ty Halliburton getting an assist to a cutting Harrison Barnes left handed layup
Harrison Barnes
"Because that roster was fucking stupid.  Warriors had just won 73 wins, and toppled a KD led OKC in 7, and lost in 7 to LeBron's superhuman performance.  They then went out and added KD for pretty much free. Only lost Harrison Barnes (...who was replaced by fucking KD) and Bogut (replaced by Zaza and DWest). That shit was dumb lol"
"Yikes, hopefully most of their players are named Harrison Barnes then, otherwise that could be pretty rough"
"""Kings not named Harrison Barnes have shot 5-for-27 (19%) on clutch shots.""  Oof"
"He's a bust relative to his draft position. He's the former #1 pick, athleticism reminiscent of a young Vince Carter, and easily had the potential to be the next superstar.      He's NOT a bust relative to the rest of the NBA. He's a Harrison Barnes, Otto Porter, Bojan Bogdanovic type of player. Strong scoring wing who can play defense when necessary."
Bill is still salty the kings didn’t trade Harrison Barnes to the Celtics for Nesmith and a first round pick lmao
"Curry/Luka/LeBron/AD/Jokic  Ja/Mitchell/PG13/KP/Valanciunas/  For that wildcard spot he has to fight over: CP3, Booker, Gobert, SGA, Harrison Barnes, KAT"
And the KD dubs were the 73-9 team but KD instead of Harrison Barnes
"When we traded DLO for Wiggins, I was on the Anti-Wiggins, as a casual that is easily influenced, I was led to believe that Wiggins was an empty stats player. I now believe in Wiggins being a lot more better player than what a lot of people believe. He's not the guy but he's what we wanted Harrison Barnes to be. Or actually exactly what Harrison Barnes was. I'm not sure how we'll perform in the playoffs yet."
"Darius Garland, Harrison Barnes"
ppl really overrating the kings talent.   harrison barnes can’t be your teams go to scorer if you want to be a playoff team.   fox is john wall 2.0.  if this was a decade ago then he would be a pg you want but not now.   buddy can’t play defense and is older than he states.   bagley is a headache.   kings need to find a trade for those three and just build with halliburton and holmes.   mitchell can their marcus smart but they could’ve gotten a better player to suit their needs
"&gt;Luke's a good coach as long as he can work with 2 Hall of Fame shooters, 2 MVP's and a Defensive Player of the year candidate on the roster.  Who's the second MVP? Harrison Barnes?"
What point is Bill even trying to make about Harrison Barnes? When has he ever had more trade value than he does right now in a career year (dude has arguably been the best King this season)?
yeah damn remember when harrison barnes had legit trade value. that guy sucks now

Harrison Barnes just a year before probably comes close
Imagine you had Steph Curry and Klay Thompson and you were calling Isos for Harrison Barnes
"Eh, we really need wing depth more than anything. Dipo isn’t fitting what we need but he could be great for bench scoring at least. Would rather have Harrison Barnes"
"&gt; Dray played more than 60% of his time at the SF spot, Harrison was PF 52% of his time (to 44% at the 3).  You're basing this on Basketball-Reference's positional assignments. Those same positional assignments say that Draymond played the 3 and Durant played the 4 in 2018 (or Draymond at the 4 and Durant at the 5 in the death lineups). As you know, that's not at all what happened on the court.  I'm open to evidence that Draymond guarded wings while Barnes guarded bigs when they were both on the floor in 2013-2014, but Basketball-Reference isn't that evidence."
"Harrison Barnes might be out of the league if Jackson had stayed his coach, too. His second season was awful because Jackson had no idea how to use him and asked him to do the exact things he wasn't good out. Steve Kerr recognized his strengths right away (athleticism on cuts and attacking closeouts) and moved him into the starting lineup ahead of Iguodala.   Credit also goes to Iguodala for recognizing that this wasn't about saying ""Barnes is better than you,"" (although there were rumors Iguodala was going to be grumpy if Barnes got the contract from GS that he got from Dallas) and accepting it with good grace.   And in conclusion: Mark Jackson was a terrible coach."
"It's completely untrue.  Draymond mostly played the 4 (with Harrison Barnes or Iguodala at the 3) as the 7th man in 2013-2014 under Jackson. Draymond had the same role in the 2014-2015 preseason under Kerr.   Draymond only became a starter under Kerr because Lee got hurt in the Warriors final preseason game.   Both of Bogut's claims are silly. Draymond mostly played the 4 in his second season, and he was very obviously not about to be out of the league after being a key rotation piece for a 50-win team in his second season in the league."
"***Harrison*** Barnes.  Draymond played 1100 of his 1800 regular season minutes alongside Harrison Barnes in 2013-2014. Draymond would play the 4 and Barnes would play the 3.  They both moved into the starting lineup fulltime in Kerr's first season in 2014-2015, with Draymond still playing the 4 and Barnes still playing the 3."
"Klay isos (and Klayups), Jermaine O'neal isos, Harrison Barnes isos (which was basically 2 dribbles and pull up), Jarrett Jack isos....."
Wasn't he playing Harrison Barnes at the 4 a decent amount though? Weird
"I guess Harrison Barnes?  Scores with really great efficiency, but the Kings are all about spreading out the touches.  So far:   .632% TS  .436% 3pt  .531% fg"
"Completely correct. I got lured in by Wood's first few games that he might be an all-star-level talent. If htat were true, then I do think a lot becomes possible. But if Wood's ceiling is Serge Ibaka/Thomas Bryant/Harrison Barnes--i.e. Wood as a quality starter, but nothing more--then this season is not happening."
"I guess the point why KD's decision was so outrageous is because of how good a player he is: as Dentingerc16 said above, KD's vying for being one of the greatest players of all time so, fans/analysts might be trying to split hairs/pick holes in the resume's of the greatest players to separate them. Most of the greatest players of all time have rings, so people like debating how important each player was to their team when they won - although KD was a FMVP both times and they would have 3peated but for injury. Clearly KD's an all-time great player, but I think part of the anger is he didn't need to go to THAT team (were 73-9, won the title the year before and lost in game 7 of the NBA finals by single digits) - if he really wanted to leave he could have gone to another contender, it didn't have to be a top 2 team in the league who just beat him in the conference finals.  Whether it's fair or not some classify his move to GSW as worse than Lebron's to Miami, because only Wade was there before and they were 47-35 and got bounced in the first round - they added the talent, but they needed to gel and build chemistry. KD was basically replacing Harrison Barnes and inserting himself into what was already a top team, who he just lost to coming from a 3-1 lead."
"Yes, we are idiots. Not gonna lie about that one. However...  &gt; They would rather have Harrison Barnes than Vucevic.  uh...wut? never have i ever seen this take on the sub  &gt; They think that Ainge had zero ability to move up 2-3 spots to get haliburton or trade all 3 of their picks for a quality player than the ass that they drafted.  I hear the exact opposite in that we could have and should have done this  &gt; Here’s an apparent bad take in the sub: Ainge has done a horrible job of roster and asset management the past two years given all the picks and players he has had.  50/50 on rosters that made it to the ECF  &gt; They act like thompson and theis is an above average front court.  As long as they aren't on the floor at the same time"
"what lmao teams trade people all the time for a bag of chips &amp; cash considerations without caring about their family, loyalty etc, nobody cares what happens to players when they get traded into a bad situation or something that wouldn’t work for them at all; but god forbid a player take control of their life.   hayward didn’t and doesn’t owe the Jazz GM or ownership anything, teams have already shown they don’t give a fuck when Harrison Barnes was traded during a game. no sympathy."
Barnes notoriously choked in 2016 because he just wasn’t ready yet. I’m saying he’ll have a great shot at redemption. This isn’t the same Harrison Barnes.
Richaun Holmes is automatic with his push shot  Harrison Barnes was also our saviour this game
"I don't know if I hate or love this team, but I do love Harrison Barnes"
HARRISON BARNES
"It's not like we're getting Cade though - probably end up with something in the 7-11 range.  I mean, sure, we got Curry and Klay and in that range, but what're the chances of something like that happening a third time?  Wiseman being picked doesn't really count because it was basically the draft class making the decision for us.  Although, Draymond and Paschall were picked in the second round and Harrison Barnes was in the same range as Steph and Klay...  Yeah, alright - it's not fair."
"Harrison Barnes barely filled the Harrison Barnes role well lmao. It’s fine we can disagree. I just truly have no clue what you’re watching. If you’re a warriors fan I apologize for harsh wording but this trade was just awful and history will bear that out when the team keeps sucking and no one wants to trade for Wiggins.   Wiggins is not capable of fulfilling the role you describe on a good team. And, because they used Russell to get Wiggins rather than good role players, they also have to rely on Oubre as a major contributor. I just feel bad for Curry"
"Yes, I do think Wiggins would’ve been extremely helpful with that. He’s a perfect third option who can create some of his own offense and hit open shots. He’s also the perfect Iggy replacement on defense as a guy who can hold his own against bigger wings like Kawhi and Lebron. He’s literally been a Harrison Barnes with better defense this season.   Sure, maybe the Warriors are overpaying Wiggins by $6-8M, but they weren’t going to find a better option to fill that Harrison Barnes role"
"&gt; If he was a defensive monster who played his ass off consistently in Minnesota  Wiggins a defensive monster? lmaoo...he put in some effort recently, kind of like players like Westbrook have done in the past. Defensive monster is a HUGE stretch (hint: take a look at his DBPM compared to his teammates) but whatever you say. It's almost as if you forget Harrison Barnes was an important part of your defensive scheme at one point."
"&gt; Every single thing we say about Wiggins is qualified by ""if he keeps playing like he has been""  Speak for yourself, the very replies to my proves this isn't true whatsoever. Your fanbase genuinely is acting like the Harrison Barnes that was in the finals is the only Harrison Barnes that was in Golden State and it's very disrespectful.  &gt; and if you think he hasn't been playing brilliantly for the Warriors I don't think you've been watching.  Brilliant isn't the word I would use, you're too much of a fanboy to see clearly. He has had good moments, like he had in Minnesota."
"We really don't.  We make the accurate history that pretty much any NBA-grade player would contribute as least as much as, if not more than, Harrison Barnes did in the 2016 finals."
"Not only can he be worse (and get played off the court), you also shouldn't let one series overshadow everything Harrison Barnes did. You Warriors fans love revisionist history. Barnes wouldn't have been starting if he was as ass as y'all pretend he was prior to the series.."
"Who? Warriors were projected to resign Harrison Barnes if they didn't get KD. The 2016 FA class was extremely weak and the winningest team got the steal of the century.  If KD stays in OKC, they were projected to sign Horford. 2017 GSW without KD would have a tough time getting out of the west against that Thunder squad or the Kawhi Spurs."
"Hold on, hold on. I have Covid, my brain is a little foggy, I probably overstated the case.   I'm saying that, if they find themselves qualified for the playoffs, but in danger of losing their first round pick (that is, picks 21-30), then that would be an optimal time to rest some players. If this pick does not convey in 2021, I believe the 1st converts to a second. In a draft with so many potentially helpful players, Dubs would ideally land between 18-20th in the overall league standings (avoiding the play-in by finishing top-6 while keeping the pick). Obviously this will vary depending on how the East does relative to the West. But if the Dubs have the opportunity to have two top-20 picks as the season winds down, and they have the option to rest Steph and Dray and position themselves optimally, that would be something I support. Worked out last time we tanked, Harrison Barnes was essential to that first title run (esp. vs Memphis IIRC).   At this point, you try to win every game. It is about guys getting better, the defense gelling, learning how to f'ing screen, getting Oubre's outside shot falling and excising that awful habit of driving into the teeth of the defense without looking to dish, figuring out how Draymond can start scoring again (seriously, Kerr needs to find him an efficient way to avg 8-10 ppg), getting Wiseman to be a stud defender (read: figuring out if he has the lateral mobility to be a switchable defender/working on post defense so that we can run teams off the 3 pt line knowing JM is there waiting an dthat he isn't going to bite on some nonsense and pick up cheap fouls), etc. etc. Million things for this team to work on.  Just, y'know, if there is an opportunity to keep that pick, I'd keep that in mind."
"You gotta be kidding me. Harrison Barnes was horrible in the finals but y'all really believe Wiggins is a better player? Warriors fanbase is straight delusional. Kind of reminds me how y'all thought D'Lo was sustainable long-term with Klay and Curry, or that KD was making Steph worse."
"&gt; Wiggins is not an upgrade to Harrison Barnes  hey, welcome to basketball fandom, are you enjoying your new sport?"
"1) Warriors haven't been champs in 3 years  2) Wiggins is not an upgrade to Harrison Barnes  3)  The Warriors lost Bogut, Iggy, Barbosa, Livingston, Durant and others and have replaced them with Oubre, Poole and other youngsters. Where's this experience and savviness outside of their Big 3?  4) Yes, they have a **YOUNG** talented C. That's just it: young, talented and unproven.  The Warriors would not be contenders just because they look good after 2 games."
"""If championship team had their championship core back, only with an upgrade to Harrison Barnes, more experience and savvy, a solid bench and a young, talented C, they'd be as much title contenders as the teams that lost to the Heat last year and teams in the West that they've already beaten"" is not the hot take you seem to think it is."
"Ayeeee what a stat OP, man listen, the bay found their Harrison Barnes, even if kell has to share that with Wiggins- even better! Steph doing gods work for that organization if they end up fighting for a spot. Buuuut same org has a Klay Thompson slow roasting in the oven for a feast of 37 year old Bron next year. Tooshay"
"That was apparently the big hang up in getting the trade done, Warriors wanted only top 2 protected, Wolves wanted top 5, this was the compromise, top 3.   Even if they have the worst record in the league the probabilities are better it conveys than not. Given the timeline of our current guys and without knowing how much the Wolves might improve next season I hope the pick conveys this season, even if it's the 8th pick or something like that. You can still land on great talent with any top 10 pick.  Klay was the 11th pick in 2011 and Harrison Barnes was the 7th pick in 2012. Hell Curry was the 7th pick in 2009. If you trust your scouting department you can end up very happy with picking anywhere in the top 10."

We got our Harrison Barnes. 👀
harrison barnes
It’s funny because Harrison Barnes is off to a fantastic start as well  Both are peaking right now
"Wiggins is playing like Warriors Harrison Barnes, which if he can sustain it is great as his ceiling is higher"
"Wiggins looking like an asset on both ends actually. If he keeps playing like this, he's staying with the Warriors.  He's looking like an advanced Harrison Barnes lately."
Harrison Barnes is First Team All-Overpaid
"When Oubre shoots 3, I'm seeing someone shooting worse than 2016 finals Harrison Barnes."
"He'd easily be a starter and have a slightly bigger role than at Denver. Hearing why he signed for the Pistons though I imagine we're not exactly his most desired location though and for his sake as a person even though it won't be up to him, I hope they don't trade him. I'd love for us to go for Harrison Barnes because he's a better playmaker but with how the Kings are playing, I doubt they'll be sellers at the deadline."
"Harrison Barnes, picked up a bad rep from the 2016 finals and his stint with the Mavericks. When he joined the Kings he became the third option on offence and has been extremely reliable for us. Pretty sure he averages the most minutes and hasn't missed a game for us"
"I know he's shown streaks of promise before, so I'm trying to keep my hopes reasonable. But from what I've seen from him so far this season, I'd take him over Harrison Barnes every time."
"I mean, he won’t ever be KD, but is it reasonable to expect he is a better player than Harrison Barnes? If he is then he is already a lot better than the trade expectation.  Especially considering the warriors traded away DLO who regressed and got a pick in return."
Friendship ended with Harrison Barnes. Now Draymond is my best Warrior.
"Just wanna point out that Harrison Barnes continues to be solid for the kings. 37 minutes, 20 points on 7/10 shooting including 3/4 from 3 and 5 assists. Just a solid dude who can play all game."
Harrison Barnes would’ve been solid in the 2000s
"Ah, yes, and they used said lottery picks on *checks*  Ekpe Udoh, Klay Thompson, and Harrison Barnes."
I really think on a 20 per year contract he is worth it. Its just that fucking 30 mill is a hard pill to swallow. I actually think in a system with Klay back he fits in perfectly. No need to drop 30 a night but fill in that Harrison Barnes roles.
"Signing David Lee, Drafting Klay, Harrison Barnes, Festus Ezeli and Draymond Green. Trading Ellis for Bogut. Signing Iggy, Livingston and Barbosa."
You agree or not?  Our 3rd best player on offense is freaking Harrison Barnes lmao
"He was already injured when he went ring-chasing. His bet was that if he could show he was a contributor to a championship team, that he could get a better payday than he would've gotten if he was only known as a guy who put up numbers on bad teams.   It's not the worst bet. It worked for Harrison Barnes. Tyson Chandler doesn't get the same-size deal with the Suns if he'd been signed from the Knicks instead of the championship Mavs."

"Who cares if KD is mad, after cupcaking out of OKC he can suck lemons.   KD proved that he can replace Harrison Barnes imo."
Harrison Barnes made an Instagram post saying goodbye to Bogi after the original trade was announced and Bogi replied to it. I’m having a hard time believing he would’ve done that if he didn’t originally want to go to Milwaukee...  Just something to consider
"&gt; They were historically great and won a Championship before KD  The only championship they won without KD was when 2 out of the top 3 beat players on their opponents team was injured. They lost to that same team the next year showing they could’ve been ring less without KD had the Cavs been healthy.  &gt; They closed out the Rockets and swept the WCF in 2019 after KD got injured, without time to replace him. They could've been even better if they had like a Harrison Barnes level wing rather than having to rely on significant Jerebko minutes  They won one game and eliminated an over performing team that fell back to Earth without KD. You forgot to mention that KD also carried the team during that same playoff run without Steph when he was injured.  &gt;They were competitive in the 2019 Finals without KD, despite several other injuries too (Klay, etc)  Define competitive? KD felt forced to too soon because of how terrible the Warriors looked without him. Klay’s injury happened in the closing game of the series when it was a foregone conclusion that they would’ve lost without KD.  Unpopular opinion but KD saves the Warrior’s legacy as much as they helped his."
"&gt; but the team also wouldn't have won at all without having both players  You can't say that with certainty. Warriors plausibly could've won without KD.   - They were historically great and won a Championship before KD - They closed out the Rockets and swept the WCF in 2019 after KD got injured, without time to replace him. They could've been even better if they had like a Harrison Barnes level wing rather than having to rely on significant Jerebko minutes  - They were competitive in the 2019 Finals without KD, despite several other injuries too (Klay, etc)"

Im assuming he’s going to get package with someone else too.   How does Kings view Harrison Barnes?   I’m thinking either Hield or Barnes.
"Honestly it kind of reminds me of when Harrison Barnes who was a 3&amp;D role player on a great team bet on himself after a desperate team like the Mavs threw him the bag to become the #1 option.   He was able to increase his scoring massively without taking too much of a hit in volume, but it never led the team to winning anything and he didnt end up fetching much in a trade by the end of his team with the Mavs.   He still has some moments with the Kings but he's pretty much gone back to his former 3&amp;D low usage role throwing in some of his iso and post moves he added in Dallas here and there."
"They could play like that because of Curry though.  Draymond's understanding of the game and defense gets everybody on the same page, and then Curry gets them all going, because that's what Curry does.  Draymond is brilliant in creating a cohesive team, but it's Curry that elevates players beyond what they were.  Harrison Barnes still hasn't matched the efficiency he had in the 2015 season, but playing alongside Curry got him paid. Mo Speights got signed after leaving the Warriors too, but only lasted a season each on two teams and was out of the league.  Draymond gets it all setup, and Curry makes it fly."
"You know, this game just makes me think about Harrison Barnes as the fallback to chasing KD.  Warriors would have happily maxed him and rode with it.  Reason I bring it up is I always think, is that alternate universe so much worse than what Wiggins and now Oubre are costing the Warriors (in terms of production / salary)?"
"Announcers keep calling Harrison Barnes ""HB"". Annoying AF."
It's the announcers. Just heard warriors commentators call Harrison Barnes HB during the game.
"when Harrison Barnes does stuff I can't even be mad, I still want him to do well"
What has happened to Harrison Barnes? He wasn't this bad on the Mavs.
My fantasy team killed it today.  Looking for you to deliver Harrison Barnes come on.
"I remember when he first came to the Dubs, when he was a starter and still had a lot of his athleticism, but when Kerr came in and wanted to bring him off the bench despite him being the better player than his replacement in the starting lineup, Harrison Barnes, Andre didn't make a big stink, didn't screw up the lockerroom, he was willing to try it and it paid off in a championship and a FMVP for Iguodala (I personally think it was a kind of suspect vote but what can you do).   I have so much respect for Andre as a player and as a person. While I of course appreciate everything KD did it was loving Iguodala that hurt the most."
Put lebron in instead of Curry they don't necessarily win a ring. Thunder and spurs probably both better than the warriors with lebron. Even if you replaced Harrison Barnes with lebron and curry with a Harrison Barnes level player. It worked so well because if the ball is in Draymonds hands he isn't an offensive liability and curry can play off ball. If the ball isn't in his hands then he is a screener and not much else.
"Anyone who said that after 2013 has just straight up not watched the Warriors. He carried a team that was in the lottery the year before with only rookie Harrison Barnes, 22 year old Klay, and Mark Jackson's bum ass to almost 50 wins and upset the 3 seed Nuggets without his best teammate David Lee. Jarrett Jack was our 2nd highest scorer that series. Jarrett fucking Jack."
Durant is the fucking best. He’s my favorite player but he replaced Harrison Barnes on a team that set the record for wins...  It’s like if PG joined the nuggets but the nuggets were 73-9 and PG was the second best player in the league  He is great and I’m glad he won because he deserved it but he could have won without them and they could have won without him...
"Yeah. Sometimes he takes this kind of awkward Harrison-Barnes-like two steps into a midrange jumper, which I hate.   But that drive, and the strength on the finish, that wasn't something Barnes could do."
"Dude reminds me so much of Harrison Barnes rn. Focusing on using his athleticism, only taking the open jumpers, being active on defense"
"Harrison Barnes  Actually, the Jeremi Grant choice is better"
"I watched their game last night. And I watched the Kings live last year in Detroit. This is the worst team in the league, hands down.  - Every single player stands around on offense and just takes turns doing whatever they want. - More chemistry can be found in a middle school couple.  - Harrison Barnes is the only person who can shoot and that's not much of a compliment because he's inconsistent."
Sebastian Telfair  Frank Ntilikina  Julius Randle  Harrison Barnes  Nicolas Batum  Willie Cauley-Stein  Jake Layman  Darius Miles  Gary Harris  Gordon Hayward  Kelly Oubre  Jordan Clarkson
"Trade for Harden probably.   But they need to use that TPE and get some nice complimentary pieces; a lot of players from the Magic could work (i.e. Gordon, Fournier, Ross) or even Harrison Barnes.   The bench is too raw but they need at least one of those guys between Grant Williams, Aaron Nesmith or Romeo Langford to break out. None are great shooters at the moment.  They'll probably continue to be a perennial second round exit though until Tatum/Brown become the next Jordan/Pippen."
"To improve on the team that made the ECF last season we really just need Kemba healthy. The Jays have stepped up in a big way. Tatum, Brown and (healthy) Kemba is looking like a really strong top 3.   To take the next step, we're one starting level wing short and it means we're asking for a lot from everyone. We're relying on our top-end talent having huge nights every night and we play a lot of bad lineups that end up costing us games.    All of our main bench players are individually good when they're playing with the starters. The issue is when we play our bench players with other bench players.   Grant Williams is a great example, he looks good playing next to Kemba, Smart, Brown, Tatum. He looks pretty bad when he's playing next to 2-3 other Grant Williams.    We could chase a secondary star, but even just 1 decent wing would take a lot of pressure off our guys.   Eg:  * Robert Covington * Otto Porter Jr * Jae Crowder * Harrison Barnes * Terrence Ross * etc etc  Our bench players are good fill-ins but 1 more starting wing would mean we don't have to play so many lineups that have a bench majority."
"&gt; Kawhi has a big hand = the Klaw  He was also known as a strong defender, and has led the league in steals. It's not *just* the hand that gave him the name.   &gt;Sir Charles  You really gonna fucking take issue with ""The Beard"" after someone has cultivated a motherfucking masterpiece of facial hair and then have the **audacity** to claim that adding ""Sir"" to someone's name is a great nickname?  &gt; Dream Shake  I thought with your logic about ""The Klaw"" being stupid because it's naming a player after having big hands, but naming a player after a move is cool? Really?  Additionally, are you gonna ignore other nicknames that exist like ""The Splash Bros."" because it's not just one player? How about Black Falcon? That was Harrison Barnes' moniker.   This whole discussion, to me, just reeks of some ""Get Off My Lawn!"" type shit. And I'm guilty of it myself in many ways, but I feel like this is a discussion in search of a problem, just stirring up shit. And if we can focus it on exploring all the various nicknames, awesome. But if it's a pissing contest, man, can we all grow up? Especially the old heads trying to prove our dicks are bigger.... It doesn't come off well for any of us."
Someone in my fantasy league dropped him for harrison barnes
"im interested to see what stone does with the 4 FRP he got in trades this offseason. if the season is going well by the trade deadline, i could see a potential trade for a solid big man (tho it also depends on whos available)  maybe if the raps arent doing great, a trade for baynes? or cody zeller? tho i dont think we've got the salary to make a zeller trade, would prob need a 3rd team. or, potentially try and swing big for myles turner  if harrison barnes wasnt on such a big contract that we cant afford, id love to pick him up too. him and wood in the front court kinda make up for each others weaknesses (outside of rebounding)"
Im not trying to dig Pop my point is just that like the Spurs last year we got a weird new team with pieces that dont obviously fit together so its kinda annoying when ppl start acting like Kerr is this trash coach because of a relatively slow start (which really hasnt even been as bad as the Nugs or Raps). I meam what is he supposed to do when we’ve have had multiple critical unexpected injuries and the guy whos supposed to be our 2nd/3rd scorer is looking like prime 2016 Finals Harrison Barnes on offense
Harrison Barnes has some of the worst shot selection in the league
"In 20 mpg he prevented LeBron from getting into the key at all, and was another deadly passer on offense.  He may have only played 20 minutes, but he played fantastic basketball in that time, one of the best +/- in the history of the league.  And Festus isn’t an amazing player, he was an okay backup, but if your starter is injured he becomes kind of important.  Harrison Barnes playing through a sprained ankle, Steph playing through a sprained knee, Iggy playing through back spasms, it goes on.  Is there maybe a reason why you’re trying to minimize what the dubs were dealing with?  Because you sound silly."
Harrison Barnes has the baddest wife ever
Really happy with how Harrison Barnes has been playing this season
"The massive cap spike and Steph's super cheap contract at the time meant they could've upgraded their roster w/ someone other than KD. Considering how thin the bench got, they should have thought about upgrading there. They could've found a cheaper replacement (than KD) for Harrison Barnes if they weren't willing to pay him what he wanted. They also could've invested in a backup for oft-injured Bogut.   KD met with OKC, GSW, Clippers, Spurs, Celtics, and Heat during FA. He's said he had already made up his mind not to stay in OKC. I doubt he would've gone to the Clippers. Not sure how he felt about Spurs (if he'd gone there, Spurs become the superteam in the West). I think if he hadn't chosen GSW, he probably would've gone East. Meaning less competition in the West (and for GSW), more competition against Lebron in the East."
"I think the main thing people seem to forget with those pre-kd warriors (even the ones with KD for the most part) is the savvy vets that lined that roster. Surrounding peak Curry, Klay &amp; Draymond with Iggy, Bogut, Livingston, and David West was just the right combination. Not to mention a serviceable Harrison Barnes and you have a squad."
"&gt; because of all the g r a v i t y  The gravity comes from Draymond (not his shooting, but the other aspects of his game), Klay, *and* Steph. And Harrison Barnes was a better 3 point shooter than Wiggins or Oubre. All people seem to remember is his poor performance from the '16 Finals, but he was his performance in Kerr's system was solid and he played within his roles and to his strengths. Steph takes the most defenders with him when he moves, but if nobody else can shoot for shit it doesn't help the team or him."
"Dude it felt like the blood was dissipating out of my veins and I was slowly dying every time Harrison missed a ridiculously wide open shot in that series.  I yelled at my walls so many times.  At least 27 times seeing as Harrison Barnes went 5 for 32 in the last 3 games of the 2016 NBA Finals.  15.6% is another numerical way to represent how fucking terrible that is.  I'm over it though, I've moved on."
"Understand?? They went 73-9! The only reason they had an issue in the playoffs is because Steph blew out his knee. In the Finals bogut broke his leg,Andre blew his back out, and Harrison Barnes blew my soul out by not hitting 1 fucking open shot all series"
"Yeah everyone always talks about how 'who can beat a lineup of Curry, Harden, LeBron, KD, AD, Draymond, Klay, Dame, etc etc etc etc. But since when do all those players actually choose to opt in?   The last us Olympic team was Kyrie/Lowry, Klay/Jimmy/DeMar, KD/PG/Melo, Harrison Barnes/Draymond, Boogie/DAJ. Which obviously still won gold and most years would also still win gold, but I wouldn't exactly call currently Melo, Harrison Barnes, DeAndre Jordan or Kyle and DeMar the top of the top talent. Great players, especially at the time, but not exactly the best of the best.   It gets even worse when you look at the last world cup roster  Kemba/Smart/Derrick White  Mitchell/Joe Harris  Middleton/Jaylen  Tatum/Barnes  BroLo/Turner/Plumlee  I know American players tend to care more about the Olympics than the world cup, but like................"
In what world were the 12-13 Warriors a bad team? David Lee who was the second best player on that team was literally an All Star averaging 19/11. Klay wasn't a star yet but he was a very solid 3rd option averaging 17ppg on 40% from 3. They also had solid depth with Jack and Landry averaging double digits off the bench and a young but solid Harrison Barnes. Late in the year they also got Bogut back from injury and he was very solid defensively and as a creator out of the post.
"This, and bear in mind that the plan was for Wiggins to be the #3 guy behind Steph and Klay.  Everything changed when Klay went down because now they have to force Wiggins into a bigger role.  If they were just asking him to be a rough approximation of Harrison Barnes then it would be fine, but now we're asking him to be Sprewell basically."
But how did the media perceive it  “Here’s Harrison Barnes finding out he got traded mid-game off the bench and told to go to the locker room”  The professional move would have been to bench him for the remainder of the game under the context of internal circumstances surrounding his trade with a post game announcement of the trade
How is beal or PG not clear favourites over Booker.  Also Capela is the best at switching at all of the big men so therefore has the most value in the playoffs out of all them.  Gary Trent Jr is a ball hawk so I'd probably pick him. Over Harris  Harrison Barnes is pretty damn good and can be your 3rd all star and is shooting 40% from 3 this year.  TJ Warren would be the bench sparkplug with his 40% 3pt shooting and 20ppg scoring.
"&gt;Harrison Barnes getting traded during a game or a different player finding out they got traded via Twitter  I think these are 2 different situations - I agree with the latter though. Your team should be upfront with you and tell you, you're getting traded over finding out through Woj.  But the Barnes situation was a bit trickier - if a trade had just been completed, if I'm the Mavs, I'm sending him back to the locker room ASAP, on the freak chance that Barnes continues to play and gets hurt mid-game."
"Harrison Barnes was warned before the game that he might be traded soon and was given the option to sit out. He didn't want to, so he found out mid game when the fans in the stadium found out. That's not the team's fault."
There is a proper level of etiquette that teams should maintain when executing trades. Harrison Barnes getting traded during a game or a different player finding out they got traded via Twitter is indicative of unprofessional behavior by the team but not perceived as such by the media as opposed to a player being called toxic for simply expressing his frustrations and desires of being competitive   You missed a lot of depth and context with this thread.
Nets would have drafted Harrison Barnes if they still had that 1st since Robinson was already drafted.   Nets were in real bad shape at the SF position at the time. Statistically it was like playing 4vs5 the SF Depth was so bad. Still a dumb trade since they should have made it Top 10 Protected at minimum since Wallace was an expiring player who’s stats were progressively falling off and needed a new contract that offseason. It was a shortened season and Nets were already out of the Playoffs when the trade happened.   The real interesting thing would have been if the Warriors decided to draft the hometown player in Lillard if the Nets drafted Harrison Barnes.   At that time Steph was still seen as a injury prone PG and hadn't taken his game to an MVP level yet. Warriors could have ran Curry-Lillard-Klay from the PG-SF position which would have been insane especially with Green as good as he was earlier in his career.   $ probably wouldn’t have worked for Durant since the Warriors let Harrison Barnes walk to make that happen  and idk if they let Lillard walk.
Idk why there's still this Harrison Barnes bullshit every time someone gets traded. Barnes was told before the game that he is likely to be traded and he still wanted to play? How is this Mavs fault Draymond?
"Correct, but his example isn’t fundamentally flawed, it’s undermined by an important exception: that the benching was mutually agreed upon. The Harrison Barnes game was a better choice of example in that Barnes was benched in the middle of the game because of a trade he didn’t know happened and somehow couldn’t be told before a media source was. That’s the fucked part: the blindsiding is glossed over when teams do it but bad when players blindside a team with a trade demand. And that one example he gave was fatally flawed doesn’t prevent him from lambasting this double standard"
1st world problems.....Harden turned down a 50m per year contract...Harrison Barnes got a $85m contract with his new team...Drummond makes 28m this year and gets paid hundreds of thousands of dollars when he sits out a game. Some of these NBA divas need to visit war torn countries in the middle east and see what real problems look like.
Harrison Barnes was traded during a game   There should be a rule against that by itself.
"Wasnt his problem that Drummond (or someone else) was dressed for the game, then sent back to the locker room and coming back to the bench in street clothes. Same with cousins where he found out he was traded in middle of the interview during an all-star game. Same with harrison barnes where he was traded in middle of the game.  Like his point was that players are supposed to be professional about this yet teams are sometimes the complete opposite."
If people think Harrison Barnes being benched mid game was a big deal they should watch baseball. Dudes will get pulled between innings because they just got traded..it happens all the time.
"Literally Dray’s point. The top 10-20 guys are part of the “player’s league” but guys like Boogie Cousins, Harrison Barnes, and Andre Drummond can get raw dogged by their teams because it’s allowed to happen."
"Vuc is obviously the big prize, if he’s available at all. It’s hard to say any one player could “fix” the Celtics, though. We should be a lot better than we are with just the pieces we have. I get that a lot of people want a trade just to shake things up. But if the ascension of the Jays isn’t helping this team win games, Harrison Barnes won’t either."
We need to get Harrison Barnes back on a championship team.
If he is on the same contract as Harrison Barnes who are you taking
Harrison Barnes is good though
"KG was a better passer than Draymond lol. Green is one of the most overrated offensive players ever. He makes the most basic reads on offense, the system is perfect for his style and also has played with all-time great shooters all through his career. Imagine prime KG with Steph and Klay as his backcourt!!! They would break the NBA. That team would fit better than the team with Kevin Durant. Perfect synergy, especially when they played with Bogut at the 5, KG at the 4, and you can get a decent 3 just slightly better than Harrison Barnes. They will win 5 rings in a row."
"I mean they are stuck with the team for at least 4 more years. All I'm saying is I'm not sacrificing the future flexibility of the team and future picks to get harrison barnes and get bounced in 6 vs the Nets vs 4.  What I would do if I was danny would be pick up younger players that have potential and keep swinging for the fences in the draft until Kemba is up, keep that cap space open (we will have max space when Kemba is done), and pair up a superstar who wants to play with the jays with them in their age 25/26 seasons."
Harrison Barnes was an all star?
"Otto Porter I think would be very gettable and wouldnt cost enough for Danny to balk. But not sure they would want to pay as much as that would cost tax wise for this team which still likely wouldnt be good enough vs the top teams. Im probably not as high on the idea of Harrison Barnes as others for what will be the price.   Would you do Eric Gordon for that exception? $17 mil, you are gambling for sure 2 more yrs after this one on that contract but he's been good this year. He doesnt perfectly fit what they need but he would help.   John Collins is the other name I would actually legitimately consider in a trade with how he's improved on defense. Problem is he still isnt truly a 5 at the end of the day."
"That’s pretty much all of them. Most stretch four/fives are on contenders who likely wouldn’t give them up. Taurean Prince and Harrison Barnes are two other ones, but both have large contracts and I doubt the Kings want to move Barnes."
"Man honestly (healthy) Blake, Westbrook, and Drummond all feel like they could end up being like Paul, Wall, Hayward, and Wiggins cases of being still overpaid but way better in the right environment  I doubt if any of them find those environments, honestly, but I'm holding out hope. Would be really nice to see them all bounce back. Doesn't feel like a Kevin Love or Harrison Barnes level of ""probably never gonna be an all-star again"" yet"
Harrison Barnes if you ask salty Celtics fans lol
"Hindsight's 20/20 but Ainge missed hard on drafting the past two years.  If you have your established trio of Tatum/Brown/Smart then he should've been more receptive to drafting older prospects who could've contributed immediately.  2019 - Drafted Romeo Langford and Grant Williams over Brandon Clarke and Matisse Thybulle (hell, they traded Thybulle to the 76ers for Carsen fucking Edwards lmao)  2020 - Traded away Desmond Bane. Saddiq Bey is obviously shining right now but I'm willing to give Nesmith the benefit of the doubt. As an IU fan I have no idea why Romeo Langford was a lottery pick. He's barely played and the best value he'll ever have to Boston is being traded for Harrison Barnes.  Honorable mention - Guerschon Yabusele at #16 in 2016 over literally anybody else (Caris LeVert, Pascal Siakam, Malcolm Brogdon, Dejountae Murray)"
I've gotten on the Harrison Barnes to the Celtics train for what it's worth.  I think both trades are very hard to pull off though.

"The 2019 offseason we opened up about 40M of cap room for Kemba and/or Danny Green. We got nobody so we resigned all of our UFA (Dwight Powell) and RFAs (KP, Kleber, DFS) to go over the cap and used the trade exception from the Harrison Barnes deal to ship two 2nd round picks for a sign and trade Delon Wright. Seth Curry signed via MLE, Boban BAE. Later on in the season we used more of that TPE to trade another 2nd pick for Cauley-Stein who didn't play in the bubble and was later resigned. We let the remaining exception which was still around 10M expire.  Then we traded Delon Wright and Justin Jackson and one or two more 2nd picks for James Johnson lol.  Our draft picks this year aren't looking too great so now idk what the front office is gonna do. This is the last offseason coming up before Luka signs his big ass extension."
"LeBron has been that since his miami days now   KD as well is pretty good, he doesn't really roll to the rim but he'll pop out for a three, or he'll get the switch and post up   Jokic actually cause they run a lot of big-small pnrs and obviously a lot of small-big pnrs  Harrison Barnes a little, he's not great but he can get his shot off a pnr and he also does the KD pop or get the switch and post"
I think Harrison Barnes is a perfect example.
Harrison Barnes
Harrison Barnes when he went from the Mavs to the Kings.
Harrison Barnes
Harrison Barnes was traded to the Kings in the middle of a game
"At some point our sub got full of toxic waste and you can see it pouring out here. It’s full of people wanting to trade the whole team, fire Danny, fire Brad and pin all our hopes on getting Aaron Gordon. Or ridiculous trade scenarios for Harrison Barnes, Vucevic or Porzingis. Players that aren’t even viably available."
2 firsts + Naismith for Harrison Barnes. Also throw in 2 championship trophies and the rights to you 1984 divisional title banner for the fun of it.
I don’t think the Clippers are selling. The general consensus is that Ainge is waiting for the Kings to fall off and then grab Harrison Barnes.
Harrison Barnes&gt;Kareem right
"The spacing and talent that Lamelo has opens up the floor for him to operate in ways Luka never had due to roster construction. Luka had a near-death Deandre Jordan, a ""supposed"" NBA player in Dennis Smith Jr, a Wesley Matthews that played like JR Smith, and a Harrison ""horse-blinders"" Barnes that passed maybe once out of a drive all season."
"""W*e took huuge bet replacing Harrison Barnes with prime Kevin Durant.*  *Nobody could've imagined that we would've been better than the previous season.""*"
"Realistic : TPE two first, two young guys for Harrison Barnes.  Unrealistic : Westbrook starts only shooting 7 times a game but brings his playmaking and rebounding in a trade for Kemba."
"Oh do they? What’s Harrison Barnes gonna do, threaten not to play?"
"Tatum and Butler over George, and I’d pick Harrison Barnes or Wiggins at the 10 spot since Grant is really more of a 4"
That pick turned into Harrison Barnes...after 2016 I'm convinced yall might have been better off without that goatend.
They also acquired KD in free agency as oppose to by trade. As a result their biggest loss was Harrison Barnes.
Warriors kept their championship winning core intact and replaced Harrison Barnes with Kevin Druant. The Nets situation is nothing like the 2017 Warriors.
You replaced Harrison Barnes with Kevin durant
"Meanwhile Mavs fans who have been around for a while realize when, before we were able to trade up for Luka, we were like “Dennis Smith Jr, Harrison Barnes, and Mo Bamba is a pretty solid core for the team, right”"
No bro. They had to figure out how to replace Harrison Barnes' minutes with Kevin Durant. That cant be easy. /s
"That someone else is Harrison Barnes. Who is a good player! Don't get me wrong. But they don't beat that Cavs team the year after.. The Cavs actually got better, it's just that the Warriors got INSANE."
Yeah Harrison Barnes and his 11-13 ppg on a max deal instead of KD on a max deal would be an incredible downgrade but that's just my opinion
"Ok, so? Warriors cruised to the finals with KD and depth and they cruised to the finals without KD and shit depth 3 years later. The 16-17 Finals would probably still go their way and the 17-18 Finals almost certainly would with no Kyrie, if they can get past the Rockets. They beat the Rockets and swept the Blazers with Alfonso McKinney to replace KD, I think Harrison Barnes would still be a major upgrade XD. Stay healthy in 2019 and the series probably is theirs too. Obviously that's a lot of probablies but Draymond was right, they didn't NEED him. He's a dumbass for saying it, no doubt."
Never forget Harrison Barnes declining his extension which allowed it to happen at all
"And without KD the team would probably have Harrison Barnes and a lot more depth. Not saying it would be the same but I think they win in 2017 and get to the 2019 Finals (which, of course, they did without Durant). And if they're healthy in 2019 with a bit thicker bench they probably win!"
https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2931191-harrison-barnes-trade-rumors-kings-not-interested-in-dealing-forward  Sorry to burst your bubble.
"I think Dray and Wiggins have both been more impactful than their BPM/VoRP would indicate (especially Draymond). But whether i agree with you depends on what you mean here by ""really good."" If you mean Wiggins is a solid starter now, I'm with you. If you think he is a borderline all-star, hell no.  [EPM,](https://dunksandthrees.com/epm) which takes into account plus/minus data and is a lot fairer to defensive players, has Draymond ranked 82nd overall, and Wiggins at 101. (Steph is 5th, and first in offense).    I still think that underrates Dray, though it's impossible to accurately measure Dray when he's currently the only 5ppg 35% shooter in league history to be indispensable to his team's offense.  I do think the ranking is accurate for Wiggs. And it's not a slight on him. Wiggins has turned himself into a top 100 player in the league, which is to say, a solid starter(5 starters x 30 teams, 150 players). This is a major improvement over Minnesota bust Wiggins. Oher players with Wiggins relative impact right now are Jae Crowder, Justin Holiday, Joe Ingles--good role players. That's where Wiggins is, though he's being asked to do more for us because we're so offensively challenged.  If you want to bump him up a little because of his ability to handle second unit scoring responsibilities--albeit inefficiently--I could accept that. That leaves Wiggins as somewhere around the 90-100th best player in the league. If that's what you mean by ""really good,""  I agree with you. Wiggins is no longer a negative on the court and has become a legitimate role player.   He's a good 4th/5th guy on a contending team--think young Harrison Barnes--being asked to be Steph's offensive sidekick. I'm starting to like Wiggins along with the rest of this scrappy team, but Steph is still hard-carrying this shit"
"Ainge: We're interested in Harrison Barnes  Kings: We're actually good for once and have desires to make the playoffs, so we'd need to be heavily incentivized in order to do a deal, how does 2 firsts sound?  Ainge: *hangs up*  That's how that conversation is going to go."
Harrison Barnes for Tatum.
Myles Turner for Harrison Barnes?
"Suns and Denver's are sus and beatable if GS can get a streak of wins going a few times over the rest of the year, but realistically it feels 4/5 is the ceiling.    Yet again, we are left to wonder what this team would look like with a healthy Klay.  With Klay, Wiggins is playing the role of a better harrison barnes, wiseman is a young Lee/Bogut, and oubre is the defensive 6th man.  I think you could actually argue that, with Klay, this team would be deeper than the 2016 team and a top 4 team in the league instead of being a 6-8 seed relying on Curry to skydfuck them into the playoffs that prob wont be able to win a 7 game series vs jazz/clippers/Lakers/"
"Yeah Pritchard really saved y'all, what w/ Kemba's knees degenerating and Teague being, well, Teague.  When Minny fans warn you about a player, it's almost always true. I think their criticisms of Wiggins are fair, but we're not expecting as much out of him (although I wish he'd take a few of Oubre's possessions/shots), and we're past 1/3 through the season and his defense has been consistent except for the 2 initial bad games. He scores w/in the flow of the game and except for a couple of games he gives us reliable scoring, and he's our best shot blocker. I'm starting to come around that we know what we can expect from Wiggins, and other than his salary he's a good match for us in the Harrison Barnes type role (except younger)."
"No it’s because he’s the greatest scorer ever, the rings did nothing for him. If Harrison Barnes was there instead of KD they would have won rings. Maybe the 2017 Cavs can challenge them but they still end up with the same amount of rings"
"&gt;I mean, yeah, I've said that repeatedly Wiggins is shittier Harrison Barnes. I wouldn't have said that Barnes was some essential part of the Warriors plans going forward in 2015.   He literally was, the only reason we gave him up was because we got Kevin motherfucking Durant lmao"
"I mean, yeah, I've said that repeatedly Wiggins is shittier Harrison Barnes. I wouldn't have said that Barnes was some essential part of the Warriors plans going forward in 2015.   What I've said is that Wiggins is there to serve as a dual purpose of being able to play Harrison Barnes role on the court, but the real purpose of him is salary filler in a trade for a star. The Warriors hoped that they'd be able to improve his trade value, and honestly, they've succeeded so far in that aspect given the way everybody talks about him.   &gt; You can't run the death lineup for 34 minutes a game. This is the reason why. Kerr has said this himself.  I know that, but honestly what's wrong with Kevon Looney and Marquese Chriss as your centers? I'd rather have Melo and play those guys as my 5s/upgrade the 5 position via free agency than draft Wiseman was my point. You can always find centers. Hell, our starting center for the last 1.5 years has been a guy we found abroad playing in Germany and he's been awesome for us."
"Well obviously, Wiggins is a much better fit with star players than D'Lo is, D'Lo is not a scalable player at all, he has to be on the ball running 50 PnRs a game to be useful, Wiggins can at least fill the Harrison Barnes role of standing in the corner and making open 3s and being a versatile, switchable good man defender.   But at the end of the day, he's still Andrew Wiggins with a low basketball IQ.   I mean, as a Warriors fan, surely you know that the reason your teams were godly and more than the sum of their parts from 2014-16 was the amount of high IQ role players you had on your team: Draymond, Iguodala, DLee, Livingston, Bogut, Barbosa etc."
"Wiggins was a throw-in to get the Minnesota pick, he has no long term value to you guys except for being salary filler in a trade for a star down the line, he's most definitely not a ""core piece,"" he's shittier Harrison Barnes.   And you don't pass on taking a potentially elite prospect because of fucking Andrew Wiggins.   And what's even worse about that logic is they all could've played together, Wiggins at the 4, Draymond at the 5."
"He's been playing *pretty good* defense.   He hasn't been all-defense level.   Both Blazers forwards have been better defenders. Both Suns forwards have been better defenders. Both Clippers wings are better. Harrison Barnes and Lu Dort and OG have all been better. Royce has been better. De'Andre Hunter has been fantastic. Oladipo's been better.   He's playing above average wing defense, that's true. But he is nowhere near a top two defender in the NBA at his position. That's moronic."
Dray wasn't a bad deal. All their draft picks since Harrison Barnes have been trash. All their mid level signings have been bad. There is alot of internal fo turmoil within their scouting department. Wasted roster spots. Look deeper.
"Oh yeah good one. People sleep on that one, we needed to tank to keep our pick that eventually turned in to Harrison Barnes. Trading for an injured center made sense in a really backwards way lol"
Bruh look at that Richaun Holmes contract. Trading for Harrison Barnes. Deciding to rebuild from Cousins with Fox as the core. Honestly he's had some pretty good hits.
More athletic harrison barnes maybe?
Harrison Barnes
&gt; they would have a lot more cap room to sign a couple of solid players.  Not that much more room.  Warriors would've matched Harrison Barnes offer from Dallas and kept Bogut.
"I have PTSD from Mark Jackson calling ISO post-ups for Harrison Barnes and Jermaine O’Neal.  Also this might be the first time I’ve seen somebody use the word “bandwagoners” correctly, instead of saying “bandwagons”. Thank you man"
Harrison barnes just broke a guy's ankle and no call. officiating has been weird both ways
"No. Not at all. Just media spiraling their name in bc they always do. This is the type of contract Celtics wouldn't take with a TPE (unless it's a salary dump, which it's not the case)  Ainge has a weekly ""state of the Celtics"" local radio thing, and as this was spiraling the media he was asked about it. His answer was quoting:   ""Shooting with size who can defend"". He also mentioned they know these type of players are expensive , only stopping short from saying, and we are willing to overpay.   He basically described Harrison Barnes type player."
"Best available wing player. Wiseman is the future in the paint, and someone to come up under Klay would be huge.   I think it’s easier to find replacement level guard play in the league now more than maybe ever, and having a real talent at the 3 would kind of recreate the Harrison Barnes dynamic - although hopefully a higher ceiling."
I think any team would be fine to pursue that record as long as they didn’t have Harrison Barnes on their team
Harrison Barnes erasure
I love Wiggins so much. He's what I pictured Harrison Barnes would become when we drafted him.
I said Wiggins is going to be Harrison Barnes on steroids here and got torched for it.
Exactly. So with Pat Bev and Lou together they could bring back around $26m in salary. How do you do that in a way that improves the team?  Victor Oladipo? Buddy Hield? Harrison Barnes? Malcolm Borgden? Zach Lavine?  It seems like only if Houston's cash-squeezed is there any reason to think a deal of one of those guys for Bev/Lou makes any sense for the other team.
We should use our TPE to get Harrison Barnes
Doncic has worse free throw rate than Harrison fucking barnes
"Harrison Barnes would fit our team perfectly, and we could give up a small amount of salary, stay under the tax line, and still have a good chunk of the TPE left for a smaller move in the offseason. I hope he can swing that."
"They don't really have a floor general without simmons. Milton is a great scorer, but he ain't running the offense. Still think they should trade danny green for harrison barnes."
Yeah and Luka has the lowest free throw rate of his career this season. Harrison Barnes has a higher free throw rate!
"Wing and playmaker that is not Teague are pretty much needed for Celtics. Kemba is like untradeable due to albatross contract, Kemba's contract make its difficult for Celtics to trade or make a move on someone. Big man is bit needed but they should not make a move for centre that can defend Embiid. Because big man that can defend Embiid is non-existent so Vuvevic is great choice for Celtics. Harrison Barnes is a great target for Celtics but Kings will probably ask for more. 2-3 firsts for Vucevic and 2 firsts for Harrison if they want to give assets up."
"Obviously this doesn’t mean that Conley is the 2nd best player in the league, and doesn’t mean that Harrison Barnes or Jerami Grant are suddenly top 15 players, but I think this can still be a pretty good way of seeing who’s been impactful for their team - a way of classifying who’s truly most valuable maybe, going by the actual definition of valuable."
Harrison Barnes? I am... I audibly gasped. Also Julius Randle too? Interesting...
"Mike Conley, Serge Ibaka, Harrison Barnes, Fred Van Vleet and Marcus Smart"
So basically Harrison Barnes.
"That's Tobias ""Harrison Barnes"" Harris to you"
Warriors fans love Harrison Barnes.
I’m here for the Harrison Barnes upvotes!!!!
The year of the Luka Draft Silver sent out a warning to teams that were testing places. Silver told the Bulls they couldn’t rest Robin Lopez and Justin Holiday and Dallas couldn’t rest Harrison Barnes. I think the frustration has to do with not being enforced the same from team to team
"""Nothing personal kid"" - Harrison Barnes"
"can't be mad with Cavs legend Harrison Barnes, still think about his legendary perfomance in the 2016 finals. Fox is a baller, the Kings have a real one"
"Harrison Barnes, please never leave us!"
"Harrison ""Harrison Barnes"" Barnes"
HARRISON BARNES?!?!?!
I FUCKING LOVE HARRISON BARNES!!
FUCK THE TANK - Harrison Barnes
Warriors went from Harrison Barnes to KD.
He might get Harrison Barnes.  Might.   Think about it. Another person for Kemba Walker to not pass to in the playoffs.
"It’s undeniable. Celtics are a solid playoff team, but they’re too many pieces away from being a contender. Kemba’s absolutely improving, Smart’s coming off injury, and I would be shocked if they didn’t make a move for someone like Harrison Barnes or JJ Redick before the deadline. But yeah that bench simply isn’t doing it."
I think the Celtics will be fine but I also think they need to make a trade. Like if they can add Harrison Barnes(1st and Langford for him) they have a shot at coming out of the east   Maybe trade Tristan Thompson as well for a bench piece in a separate deal
"Yeah Bledsoe got appropriately slandered for his terrible play but there was enough blame to go around. Besides he's a role player, ultimately he didn't hold the the fate of the Bucks' playoff run in his hands. The games they lost were close enough that anyone could have stepped up. Naturally you look to your star players first and where they could have played better, then the coaches, then the supporting cast. You don't overlook the first two and pardon their shortcomings just to lay all the blame on the 6th most important guy on the team^^^^^cough ^^^^^cough ^^^^^Harrison ^^^^^Barnes"
Remember Harrison Barnes posterizing Nikola Pekovic? This has that same vibe to it
"Hear me out. Do you think a solution could be trading oubre or wiggins for harrison barnes back? (Maybe warriors get assets back?) I was thinking this could a good altnerstive since barnes already knows the system and how to play with curry, klay and dray instead of hoping it may work out with oubre or wiggins. What's your take on it? I was thinking wiggins for barnes + assets and oubre for bench depth (backup PG?). What do you think of these potential moves going forward?"
"OP is speaking about the rest of the team. if we are looking at Steph from a lenses of always having all time greats, unless you believe David lee is an all time great, he only had one other all star. And Steph in 2013 is what made me and others pay attention to him. Curry really did his thing in that post season and the best player behind him in both of those series was Harrison Barnes, Jarrett jack and pre star Klay Thompson"
"&gt;22 million dollar Kevin Love's per game stats in the 2016 NBA Finals was 8.5/6.8/1.3 on .468 TS%.  Holy shit I thought that was a typo and you meant 18.5 ppg. That's ridiculous, surprised he doesn't get more backlash for that. That's worse than Harrison Barnes in the same series where everyone thought he shit the bed.  Can't really say K Love helped them win a championship, yes he was better earlier on in the playoffs but Kyrie and LeBron carried the load."
I'm an optimistic Celtics homer but I feel like there's a lot of matchups where the Celtics would be underdogs but *could* win. Especially if they can add a Harrison Barnes type.   A lot would have to fall the right way. Like Embiid/Giannis having enough to crush Brooklyn in the 2nd round but then starting to wear down in the ECFs. And someone like the Clippers coming out of the west.   It might be a 1% chance but I don't think its a 0% chance.
Harrison Barnes
Thats why durant is the 2fmvp and curry is still with zero fmvps. Durant was the best player in that team. Doubt the warriors without durant would even beat the rockets or the cavs with Harrison barnes.
"Baaically went from Klay, Harrison Barnes, Bogut, Iguodala, and Livingston to Wiggins, Oubre, Wiseman, Paschall, Lee."
They tanked hard for finals legend Harrison Barnes
Harrison Barnes ate steak and egg tacos with french fries.
One Harrison Barnes away man :(
If there was a DPOF award I'd give it to Harrison Barnes in 2016 for stopping the Warriors from winning a ring
Someone rescue Harrison Barnes from these cats
"Uh, first of all, there were plenty of possessions where the Cavs *didn't* hunt Curry for an ISO mismatch. There were plenty of times when they hunted other players or didn't go ISO hunting at all.  Second of all, yeah, of course they went for the clearest mismatch more often than not. That's just kind of a 'no shit' thing. Yes, Curry was a worse defender on LeBron than Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Harrison Barnes, or Andre Iguodala. Not really much shame in that."
"What do you mean?  Are you nitpicking the KD inclusion?  Fine, go replace it with Harrison Barnes or Andrew Bogut and tell me if that changes things at all.  Both were arguably better defenders than KD."
Whoa WTF harrison barnes is balding?
"Theis and the TimeLord are a perfectly fine big man duo. TT a sieve on defense who isn’t quite athletic enough to be superswitchy or big enough to stop opposing C’s. Most fans would rather Grant Williams be our third string center at this point, maybe get a big body on a minimum contract. No interest in paying TT $10 million next year.   C’s actual need is playable wing depth. Hence interest in Harrison Barnes, Aaron Gordon, Jerami Grant, etc. We’d rather Semi not need to play 15 minutes in a close playoff game (although his shooting is being underrated by our fans right now)"
"They saw that Marvel's Falcon and Winter Soldier comes out Friday.  Harrison ""Falcon"" Barnes."
Harrison Barnes would be the guy I'd target.
"Harrison Barnes 1.6, obviously."
"If its a direct conversion rate, he would be 1.6 barnes, but it think the exchange is tricky. Id say he could be harrison wiggins 2.0.1"
"If Wiggins is Harrison Barnes 0.8, what does that make Anthony Edwards?"
John Collins to Minnesota for something centered around Malik Beasely and Jaden Mcdaniels  Harrison Barnes to Boston for Romeo Langford and a first  George Hill to the Clippers for Lou Williams and Detroit seconds
"Yeah his defensive energy is great and I love it, but I have come to terms to not expect more than Harrison Barnes at the offensive end. Its not back if Klay can come back averaging 20 a night. But only getting 15ppg kinda looks bad when you see his contract, granted thats what we would've paid Barnes to stay anyways."
"2016 Warriors  Literally any SF besides Harrison Barnes. Give us Doug McDermott we winning.  2020 Clippers  Kyle Lowry  Hot take, but this team is obviously missing a floor general and playmaker, I think they would have imploded much less last season with Lowry at PG"
"Team B can’t defend at all  Team A has 2 star players, and Harrison Barnes is a good player too  Stop Curry and they’ll win"
"Don’t get me wrong, he was the same player in the KD years. It was just incredible watching him go ham on the entire league with a 6’5” PF who can’t shoot or create, a C who can’t jump or score from anywhere, a SG who can’t dribble (but a top 5 shooter ever), and baby Harrison Barnes. I don’t think people realize how bad that 4 would be offensively without Steph."
Harrison Barnes is a real solid player but he’s not worth 24 million  Klay is the worst rn imo
"Very true, but I also distinctly remember the warriors offense being very middling compared to their talent. In particular, I remember Zach Lowe complaining about Klay Thompson and Harrison Barnes postups with Mark Jackson"
I remember one game against the Process 76ers where he was totally statpadding for assists I think. We blew a huge 4th quarter lead before being bailed out by a Harrison Barnes game winning 3 pointer
"For a 7th overall pick he's a bit disappointing. You expect a guy at 7th to be at the very least an alright starter.  2019: Coby White, Bulls.  2018: Wendell Carter Jr., Bulls.  2017: Lauri Markkanen, Timberwolves.  2016: Jamal Murray, Nuggets.  2015: Emmanuel Mudiay, Nuggets.  2014: Julius Randle, Lakers.  2013: Ben McLemore, Kings.  2012: Harrison Barnes, Warriors."
It’s an improvement on defense and you can better trust him to be healthy. But they should be saving Olynyk+Nunn for a Harrison Barnes offer
"He’s so much better defensively as a 4 than a 3 and yet Malone brought back Millsap into the starting lineup yesterday, don’t think he trusts him yet with help defense, but like, he’s got to play in order to get better.   I know we’re trying to trade for him, but you guys could also use Harrison Barnes a lot."
Harrison Barnes would be a great addition I think. JaVale McGee solves the Isaiah Hartenstein problem which is that Isaiah Hartenstein is not very good yet is playing a lot because there's no one else
Now that's just wrong. Harrison Barnes? Livingston? Really?
"Steph, Clay, Draymond, Harrison Barnes, Shawn Livingston"
2 1sts for Harrison Barnes
"kyle lowry/jerami grant/lonzo ball/harrison barnes are the best players that could be traded. Barnes could net two picks maybe more depending on what is being returned. Lowry is probably the hardest guy to gauge, but a couple firsts would probably be in order. Ball probably gets trade for a young piece + picks if pelicans don't plan on re-signing him. Grant probably nets a couple picks + salary filler."
"Are you suggesting KD carried Russ through the playoffs? He literally played better than KD in their last series against the 73 win Warriors when they were up 3-1. KD left one MVP to go play with another MVP that already had a championship winning team. They literally swapped Harrison Barnes for KD lmao! And who are you to say Russ didn't ""deserve"" his MVP? His peers voted for him for the player's MVP that season as well. But hey fuck their opinion. All that matters is what some random Redditor thinks. And going by your username you're maybe a Rockets fan."
Tbh this sounds like a lot of coping. I think ainge is a good gm but he doesn’t have an unlimited amount of time with jaylen brown and Tatum. He has to make a move soon or those guys will start wanting out   I feel like a Harrison Barnes move makes the Celtics better and is so easy to make. Literally send a first and you’re good.
I would say best case is jerami grant if they pony up a bunch of firsts.  Most likely is Harrison Barnes or Celtics doing nothing
You are the idiot that is refusing to understand the Pistons a rebuilding team would love to trade there 27 year old above average wing for a ton of picks.  This is close to the same situation the Kings are in with Harrison Barnes. Look around this tons of people are saying it’s a great trade and the Celtics have reportedly made an offer.  Only person not worth arguing with is the stupid Portland fan that things Detroit is hurting there free agency chances lmao
Final game of 2011/12 Warriors season vs Spurs. We were tanking to get the pick that would be Harrison Barnes.  PG- Charles Jenkins  SG- (rookie) Klay Thompson  SF- Chris Wright  PF- Mickell Gladness  C- Jeremy Tyler
"Harrison Barnes is a PF in the modern game as well, can't forget Draymond"
"Man, Bill Simmons will be in absolute shambles if this happens. He’s got a major hard-on for Harrison Barnes and has been down on Jerami Grant all season.  Of course, if the Celts get him, he’ll most likely pivot into being high on him again as a “4th Option.”"
"Regardless of your opinion on Turner the point is if Boston had accepted a Turner trade they'd have to give up less assets for a Barnes trade.  There was no way an asking price of Oladipo + Turner was going through - it would've probably been something like Oladipo and Jeremy Lamb. So a Harrison Barnes trade would've been Turner + salary match + a first round pick.   The salary match in that case could've been someone expendable like Semi versus instead of someone like Nesmith/Langford. On top of that, you'd have whatever extra guy you'd get back from the Indiana trade."
"Even if they did, something like that isn’t really the same to me as KD joining a 73 win team that win a championship without him and didn’t give up anything but Harrison Barnes to get him"
Sounds like a Harrison Barnes.  Do you feel disappointed that the Turner trade didn't go through? I mean sure you got the TPE but now you have to dip into your own assets to actually use the TPE and get someone like Harrison Barnes.
"Was at that game, fucking Harrison Barnes"
I think they will use the TPE on Harrison Barnes.

"It's primarily a roster issue. Klay being out for 2 years w/ 2 devastating injuries while taking up huge cap space. Chriss being out for the year after breaking his ankle/leg after the first 2 brutal losses. And the S&amp;T getting D'Lo for KD when KD decided to leave, while a nice gesture rather than just leaving in FA, turned into the Wiggins contract (he's not bad in the young Harrison Barnes role, but he makes too much, and D'Lo got paid that much to match salaries for KD). Wiseman being a rookie w/ 3 college games under his belt and COVID having him and Dray miss all of camp/pre-season.  Some people think Kerr should be fired or that he's getting exposed, but seeing how the starters can barely keep games close while the bench is so bad (it's basically full of G-Leaguers and last year's rookies), I think Kerr's done an above-average job of trying to make the playoffs (even if it's play-ins), develop the young players, evaluate players and so he can give his input on who to keep, and everything else he's gotta do. Some analysts have said they think Kerr has done a lowkey decent job this season w/ a messed up roster that's barely played together and injury issues."
"Do you feel like it was lucky that it happened?  I mean, management had decided that Steph and Monta couldn't coexist (correct), that Steph was the player to bank on (correct) and they managed to finesse that into getting the best player in the trade (Bogut) AND Stephen Jackson. Plus trading for an injured Bogut meant they were more likely to keep their 1st round pick in that years draft (who they used on Harrison Barnes).  Was it because you didn't the short term cost of them tanking games that season?"
"But KD didn't join as the result of a trade, he signed there in free agency.  So did iguodala.  They weren't tanking either, the highest drafted guy they ended up getting was harrison barnes at #7 overall.     They also didn't start out competing for the title with their current core players, they had 3-5 years of early playoff exits and steady contention for the 5th-8th seed before everything clicked for them.     So the GSW dynasty was built by doing exactly the things that you think that teams shouldn't do, and you have no idea what you are talking about."
Yeah we got talent just need a big and someone to replace Hayward( hopefully Harrison Barnes)
I thought the whole point of a trade exception was to be used as salary filler in a trade. Hence all the rumors of Boston using theirs for Harrison Barnes.
Harrison Barnes
Youre more likely to get Horford back than Harrison Barnes.
Or at least deserves an honorable mention. Maybe that's what I should do with the Bulls trios and Harrison Barnes.
"&gt;Explanations aren't excuse, my friend. **I merely stated that he's playing bad because of this**, and that shouldn't discount what he did the year prior.  That’s literally an excuse as to why he’s playing bad LOL cmon man   &gt;Also, what's so delusional about exploring trades that we give less away? I didn't once say he's off the table, the most I said was that I was conflicted on trading him, and then offered to give someone away first before doing so.  Because they aren’t realistic lmao. Being conflicted about including Grant Williams for Harrison Barnes is wild.   &gt;A lot of people on reddit come here to discuss. You act here like your opinion is fact, then start saying you merely opposed the opinion. I defended my opinion and you acted like I'm stupid (""you'd be fired"", ""what are you talking about lmao"", ""being a delusional homer""). I called you out on it and you're now calling me defensive. What did you expect me to do, roll over my opinion because you see yours as fact?  I did say I opposed your opinion, becuase that’s what I did. I called you defensive because you were getting defensive.   I didn’t expect you to do anything in particular I just voiced my opinion. I guess that’s not allowed on Reddit “where a lot of people come to discuss”    &gt;Hope you do better with commenting on other's opinions without all the added shit. Not everyone is in the perfect state of mind to deal with your bullshit.  Hope you can stop being delusional about trades."
"Tanking can also get you a guy who *helps* you get there even if he doesn't become an all-star. For example, the Warriors tanking to get Harrison Barnes who helped them win a chip, or the Celtics tanking to get Marcus Smart who helped them get to 3 ECFs (so far). I would also say Smart was the 2nd best player on the 2015 and 2016 squads even though he didn't start."
Harrison Barnes is a terrible 3 FYI.   He does best as a 4.
Well I guess that’s why Harrison Barnes seems appealing to me. He’d be pretty cheap compared to a Vooch or Lowry trade.
"How do you know Amick’s sources here? This is crazy it’s pretty much, “sources say this vague insinuation that Ainge pursued Harden more intensely than he may have suggested.” What are they even saying, what even is the allegation? It’s amazing what conclusions this throwaway line in an article about a potential Harrison Barnes trade makes people jump to."
"The guy most Celtics fans are high on is Harrison Barnes. But anyone in a similar situation would be an option too.   I don't think we could use the TPE to get a player on a team looking to contend, but for the many tanking/rebuilding teams in the league, being able to offload a big contract *while* getting picks/young players in return would be great."
Celtic fans: why is Harrison Barnes on the top of your list as opposed to a floor general guard or a center?
The Celtics could get him with their trade exception. Unless theyre still delusional to think that the Kings will just give them Harrison Barnes.
Harrison Barnes or Evan Fournier would be so nice on the team at the 3 if we can negotiate a deal
"Obviously it is, but it’s easier being efficient when you 5 best player is Harrison Barnes is Igoudala or Harrison Barnes than when it’s Corey Brewer."
"The warriors rings are completely meaningless to the vast majority of fans who watched basketball before Durant joined the warriors and not impressive whatsoever because he joined an already established juggernaut that won a title, made 2 finals, set a million different records and it’s a team that had the best offense and defense in the league before Durant even joined. Of course adding Durant would be free rings.   Durant is the 2nd/3rd best player in the league and got guarded like a role player in the finals multiple times  It was a joke. The team won a ring and was 5 points away from going back to back with Harrison Barnes yet I’m supposed to be impressed when KD wins it there? Nah    that was literally a free ring, the warriors would have been one of the top 1-2 contenders to win without Durant    I truly don’t see how people are impressed with those rings. I honestly think less of you’re basketball knowledge if you think KD went through any adversity or struggled for those rings   If anything it’s embarrassing he was about to lose to a james harden team before CP3 went down. Dude joined an all time great team he couldn’t beat and still almost lost"
Saving this for when Harrison Barnes is eventually dealt for something similar to that proposed package.
"Why was an article about the upcoming trade deadline written where the Celtics potential pursuit of Harrison Barnes using the Hayward TPE was discussed, probably because the trade deadline is happening soon.  Who Amick’s sources are and what they suggested Ainge did differently than Ainge publicly suggested he did in pursuit of James Harden, I don’t know because Amick didn’t say.   The article links to an NBC Sports Boston article/video of a radio interview Ainge gave. In the interview Ainge said they had conversations with the Rockets but not recently as they were not coming down on the price they were asking for and the Celtics didn’t want to pay that. Given how trades work and assuming the Rockets didn’t want Kemba, Jaylen Brown would have needed to have been traded for the Celtics to get Harden. I don’t really see how if the Celtics actually offered Brown why the Rockets wouldn’t have gone for that instead of what they did get. And if the sources are saying, “Ainge said he didn’t have talks recently before the trade had happened, but actually the Celtics did have a recent phone call before the trade,” then I certainly get why they left that tid bit ambiguous."
"Arguably Livingston as well. But don't discount that Harrison Barnes was a key part of the Death Lineup. Even if he was only asked to defend and shoot 3s, he did that well enough for the Warriors to win a title."
The solution to Boston's woes is..... Harrison Barnes???
Think of what kind of talent the 27th pick could get you? Maybe someone like Harrison Barnes?
Why would Harrison Barnes value change because he's the second best player? Does being the second best player on a 14 win team mean that he's worth *more*?
Yeah if your third best player is Harrison Barnes you are going to be a lottery team.
I mean Harrison Barnes is a Tar Heel legend too. Part of the team that’s the reason I hate Creighton.
"Great.  ""With a $28.5m trade exception from the Hayward trade, the Celtics are looking to acquire Harrison Barnes. The Kings are now in seller mode.""  or my original with tweaks  ""Now that the Kings have shifted to seller mode, The Celtics are considering using their $28.5m Hayward trade exception to land Harrison Barnes.""  I get the inverted pyramid, it's just such a clunky fucking sentence. But I'm in advertising so my writing style is completely different lol."
Harrison Barnes would get same contract if he was on the open market. He has a positive value. I don't think you can use the he's overpaid argument to justify him not being worth much in a trade. Check his production
Harrison Barnes is good but he's definitely worse than Hayward so it's not like this move would make the celtics be better than they were last season
I think Harrison Barnes’ value is being overestimated in this thread.Also  the TPE gives Boston the cap flexibility to facilitate a Barnes deal.
"""- Guys we need to improve our roster to increase our championship chances."" ""- Let's trade for Harrison Barnes!"" ""- Ur fired."""
Memphis Rudy Gay was in a whole nother league than Harrison Barnes tho
"It’s called a reverse-pyramid lead. The author wanted the team names and big number to be first. Harrison Barnes isn’t exactly a super high profile player, so his name isn’t as important to garnering attention and can therefore be relegated to the end  It’s present in basically every facet of news titles and leads, it’s written that way to make you read as much as possible"
16 finals mvp Harrison Barnes
Luke Walton's play is for a Harrison Barnes contested 3 pointer?
Harrison Barnes missing a 3 to end a game. Why is that so familiar...
Luke Walton.   Harrison barnes ISO’s.   Mark jackson  Strong guys shaking hands in the middle.
"And in the end, Warriors legend Harrison Barnes let y'all off the hook"
warrior lifer: harrison barnes
Hate all you want I watched Harrison Barnes make that exact shot like 12 times against the Pels in our matchups this year
"Death, taxes and Harrison Barnes selling"
Harrison Barnes iso because why not.
Clean look from Harrison Barnes  Just didn't go in
When you turn to Harrison Barnes for hero ball you should already know how it’s going to end
That's the Harrison Barnes I know.
Man I miss Harrison Barnes on the warriors
Harrison Barnes decided to become a sniper for the first time in his life lmao
this is Harrison Barnes night baby! Everbody get in here!
"why wont the mods let me post harrison barnes highlights what the fuck, they keep deleting them"
"The Black Winter Soldier, Harrison Barnes."
Yes Harrison Barnes and Andrew Bogut &gt; KD
Fucking Harrison Barnes lol
"I think that if the Warriors win in 2016 though, Harrison Barnes re-signs and KD doesn't join them."
They took the best version of the Cavs to 7 and lost in the last minute. Harrison Barnes to Paul George absolutely is enough lol
Ironic how Buddy is talking about passing the ball more when him and the other Kings players never pass the ball to an open Harrison Barnes most of the time. This team has a bunch of players wanting to play hero ball. Mainly him and Fox
Harrison Barnes is 28.
Harrison Barnes in the finals. Pretty much felt like he broke the record for most wide open shots ever bricked.
Harrison Barnes had to forget how to shoot for LeBron to win a title
"Harrison Barnes shot 2-22 in games 5 and 6 of that series. His poor shooting display that series allowed Lebron to lurk around/play safety. You say “lost by only 4” but that had **NO business** losing that series to begin with. Doesn’t matter if they lose by only 1 point, Warriors shouldn’t have lost and draymond played game 6 and 7 so your point is mute  That 2016-2017 Cavs team was actually the best version of that team too. They would have smoked that Warriors team with Barnes/Khris in place of KD lmaoo. You can’t just put someone in place of a Top 2 player and expect the same production. Khris at best is a top 15-20 guy. He doesn’t match up to Lebron the way KD does"
It’s not 100% stamped the Warriors win with those 2 in place of KD. KD balances out Lebrons impact which was important. Bron would have dominated Middleton and Barnes...who’s one of the reasons they lost in 2016 assuming you talking about Harrison Barnes
2017? Toss-up. Golden state would have spent the cap space they used on KD on someone else to improve. Maybe just re-sign Harrison barnes and add another piece.   2018? Without kyrie? No.  So maybe he gets 2017.
Bruh  LeBron and dwade had to build a team and find the right pieces and learn how to play with each other   KD slid right into Harrison Barnes spot seamlessly on an already 73 win team with established culture and roles   LeBron didn’t lose to Miami after being up 3-1 the year prior   Why do we keep having this discussion
What team not named dallas wouldn't trade future 2nd picks for Porzingis if they had the cap room? That's a damn good gamble.  We traded 4 2nd picks to move Harrison Barnes to eventually have JJ Redick.
Harrison Barnes?

"You can tell, everyone who tears their Achilles always looks back and grabs it thinking it got hit. If you watch the Kobe one, he actually asks Harrison Barnes if he kicked the back of his foot, and when Barnes said no you can see Kobe figuring out what happened."
We tanked for Harrison Barnes &amp; tbh for Wiseman too
Wait you mean putting Harrison Barnes at the 5 to guard one of the best sciring centers was a bad idea? No way.
"Imo the 2017 cavs team would have trashed the Warriors team if we had kept Harrison Barnes instead of getting KD.  You guys improved your offensive firepower quite a bit which is why you annihilated your way through the eastern playoffs without breaking a sweat.  Warriors would have still lost lots of bench players that off season since they would have been paying Barnes the max.  Cavs upgraded well going into the finals in 2017, Warriors just upgraded a lot better. But on the flip side I completely understand why you wish we did not get KD"
That's stupid. They had a chance to upgrade Harrison Barnes with KD. What team is going to pass that up? No team has ever avoided making a move because they would be too good.

"Same thing happened to Harrison Barnes. He used to poster people in his first and second season, then he tweaked his knee after dunking on Aaron Grey and never did it again. Tbf looked pretty scary but he got up.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QyJie2D1LQ"
"Winning rings after replacing Harrison Barnes on a team that won a ring and went 73-9 and lost in game 7 does not make you better lol  Dude had no pressure and went through no adversity to get his rings.  No wonder he says winning a ring didn’t mean anything to him, he didn’t earn them."
"Solid defender. Okay scorer. I have higher expectations for Wiggins than I think he has for himself. I think he's capable of more, but maybe that's my fault. I think he is what he is and I need to accept that again. I pretty much did but then he got traded to GS and I thought maybe it could be like a coming out party, in a sense, for him. Despite my opinion of him as an overall player, I think he's basically Harrison Barnes+ and I guess that isn't a bad thing."
"&gt; he spends his fouls wisely, which is rare at center  So true. He spends his fouls like a wise politician spends political capital. (Or is that a more apt comparison for Harrison ""The Senator' Barnes...)"
Not sure but Harrison Barnes needs to be first ballot into the Hall of Solid.
"Mfing Kings.  Anybody stupid enough to take Hield?  Are they smart enough to re-sign Holmes?  How good will Halliburton be?  Did we get Cade, or did we get screwed?  Where In The World Is Harrison Barnes?  Is Luke still.gonna be coach? It could happen."
To be fair Harrison Barnes is only a slightly better KD
"Plus Wiggins slides into that Harrison Barnes role, and Wiggins is a better offensive talent than Harry"
Tatum swinging between being a top 5 player or mutton chopped harrison barnes is always so crazy
&gt; Whats stopping anyone from trading all their picks out with protection then run shenanigans to make it happen?  Nothing. The Warriors shamelessly tanked the 2011-12 season to avoid conveying the pick that became Harrison Barnes. There will always be some fuckery on the margins. I'm still surprised we didn't tank our way into keeping the 21st pick that we sent to Philadelphia last year.
Harrison Barnes
"I guess it's a hot take in this anti-KD thread, but they helped each other.  Imo the Warriors lose to the Rockets in 2018 if you replace KD with Harrison Barnes.  They needed each other, and that's why Draymond called KD right after the Warriors lost."
"Harrison barnes got 24 million 4 years ago as a worse offensive player with more experience and a moderately better defender and worse rebounder.   24 million. 4 years ago. Less valuable player, more experience.   30 million for MPJ is a certainty, all it takes is 1 team offering it."
"Ok let's go through all the players putting up those numbers on that efficiency at under 2500 minutes played in the last 5 years regardless of how open they are or aren't.   Only Zion beats the efficiency. And everyone else who was even in that realm has been given a max extension. And none of them were in that realm until hitting around 4k to 5k minutes played.   Tatum at under 2500 minutes? Not even close. Donovan? Had the ppg but on like 53%ts. Jaylen? Not close and rival exec's said they would've maxed him. Ingram? Again not close. Harrison barnes got 24 a year 4 years ago and again, not close to that production at that experience.   The only way MPJ doesn't get the max is if the nuggets negotiate him out of it like Boston did with Brown. I am certain someone will ink him to a max offer sheet if he hits rfa"
Imagine saying kd could lead a team just cause he won after joining a 73 win team that already won a ring before he got there  Of course a talent like kd can go off on that team when he’s replacing Harrison Barnes. There were already favorites for the title before he joined their team lmao   And if he’s  without curry it means kd would actually face some adversity on the warriors. He wouldn’t lead them anywhere.
Clearly you have to trade him for Harrison Barnes immediately
Harrison Barnes
"We're more down on Terry Stotts than any individual player right now. I'd probably have a better opinion of Melo and Kanter if we had a coach that would limit them to the match-up dependent role players that they are instead of making them a featured part of our rotation.   I've never been a trade CJ guy (unless a great trade comes along obviously) but now that we've acquired Norman Powell, it just doesn't make sense to have CJ anymore. Re-sign Norman for 20-25M per year next season (CJ for reference makes fucking 30M+), and trade CJ for something else. Whether it's a Tobias Harris/Harrison Barnes swap, or a young dude (Deandre Hunter would be a dream) + expiring's/draft picks, it just doesn't make sense to have him anymore now that we have Norm (who has plus plus measurables as a defensive 2).  In an ideal world we trade CJ for some kind of a forward, fire Terry, let Melo/Kanter expire into the sunset, Zach Collins accepts his QO, DJJ opts into his 2nd year and we re-sign Norman Powell to a 4 year 20-ish million dollar long term deal."
"He should be able to post up Harrison Barnes. Straight up. Barnes can’t deal with size, and KP could’ve taken advantage, but he stayed out of the pain the whole night."
I never would have thought Harrison Barnes had a burner Reddit
Small ball center moe Harkless looks better than small ball center Harrison Barnes the other night
Harrison Barnes with the PG pass
Mavs legend Harrison barnes
"Huh? What do the Wolves have to do with Tobias Harris? Didn't know that was a narrative, he's been better than Wiggins for years. Guess we'll have to wait and see, if Wiggins makes that kind of money again it will be on a non-contender like Harrison Barnes did. Championship teams won't reach that far for an average starter."
Free agents don’t determine market size.  And y’all def get free agents. I remember Harrison Barnes was one of the bigger scores that summer. Not that he’s great now but back then that was big.   Watch the next few summers: y’all are gonna score big and it’s gonna suck (for us)
"Ok but they also won a ring without KD and then it took Lebron and Kyrie going absolutely nuclear for the last 3 games of 2016, plus a draymond suspension, and the greatest block in history and one of the greatest shots ever.... just for the Cavs to barely beat them in 7 games. They won with Harrison Barnes playing KDs position...."
Wiggins makes 6m more than Harrison Barnes this season. That's just what athletic wings cost these days.
The reverse Harrison Barnes
"The celtics only won 1 ring and made the finals twice in their 5 years. While good, that's not the level of dominance I would associate with the term ""superteam"". By the time Lebron formed his own big 3, the celtics big 3 were already old and past their primes. Paul, Allen, and Garnett were 34,36, and 37 years old respectively in 2011. Ray Allen also pulled a KD and joined that same Miami heat team that won the championship that year.  ""KD joined a 73-9 team"". I heard that old line thousands of times already. That 2015-2016 warriors team was a ""lightning in a bottle"" situation. The factors that allowed that team to exist probably won't ever happen again with the salary cap increasing and a Max player being paid peanuts.   If KD doesn't join the warriors in 2017, the warriors definitely get a lot worse as a team in 2017. The warriors had the best bench in the league in 2016, but a mere 3 years later, they had the worse bench in the league. In 2017, role players on the warriors like Harrison Barnes were demanding Max-level money and if KD doesn't sign, GS probably resigns Barnes. GS was forced to let a lot of their depth walk in free agency. Steph was being horribly underpaid at the time and was eyeing the supermax. Without KD taking paycuts, Iguodala probably also leaves in free agency in 2018. At best, the warriors win 1 more ring in 2017 (I doubt that), the cavs were unstoppable going 12-1 against the east in the playoffs, no way in hell they beat the rockets in 2018, and we already know what happens in 2019.  What tools did KD have to win a championship in OKC? OKC as organization favored Westbrook over KD and allowed him to run rampant as the primary decision maker on that team. Westbrook is a great player, but his high usage rate + inefficiency doesn't lead to playoff success. OKC also made really dumb decisions like signing a person who has never coached in the NBA as their head coach, using big chunks of their salary cap to sign big men that were damn near unplayable in the small ball era, and TRADING JAMES HARDEN for scraps because they didn't want to pay the luxury tax. That last reason alone should be enough."
"He's shooting 48% on the season. Him shooting &lt; 50% when Dončić sits isn't that surprising. It's not like he's DeAndre Jordan and shooting 70% from the field.   I know this isn't exactly what you are talking about, you mean games they both play and Luka goes to the bench, but in the games Porziņģis has played without Luka entirely he's averaged 25 &amp; 15.5. Those are great numbers. Last year he averaged 27 and 12 in games Luka didn't play. He's shown he can lead this team without Luka.  Naturally his FG% will decrease when he doesn't have an MVP candidate feeding him the ball, spacing the floor and drawing defenders.   His passing has actually been pretty solid when Luka sits. Our ball movement is much much better without Luka. When Luka plays we have a very heliocentric offense that 100% revolves around Luka, for better or worse. His APG may not be super high, but he has decent vision and is good about keeping the ball moving. He's not a black hole offensively like Harrison Barnes was."
2017 wasn’t fair lol tbf the 2017 Cavs probably beat the 2016 Warriors but not the 2016 Warriors upgrading Harrison Barnes to KD
"Why are you just blanket assuming other adjustments can't be made when a big gets pulled out into a pick n roll. you realize you can also adjust to have the big drop back, or bring help too incentivizing passes that take the ball out of their hands? There's also a deterrent/fatigue factor when constantly driving at a 7 footer. Small sample plus minus (4 games) is not that compelling of a story. Not to mention he does have a positive effect as a lob threat and an extra passer on the offensive end so that the offense doesn't become ""unguarded harrison barnes bricks corner 3"""
"We’ve been writing some articles about NBA players using NBA Top Shot, including Terry Rozier, Josh Hart, and Spencer Dinwiddie. This week, we wrote about [Harrison Barnes](https://www.nft-boyz.com/2021/04/heres-how-harrison-barnes-became-nbas.html?m=1), who is the most active NBA player on the platform."
Luke got so fed up with whiteside in the pick and roll vs Chris Paul he just ran with Harrison Barnes as his 5 in the 4th quarter. Shockingly the defense issues did not go away
Him and Harrison Barnes being the same age is wild to me.
Wasn't Harrison Barnes a decent rookie for gsw?
"After Curry,  Klay Thompson - First team all rookie  Harrison Barnes - First team all rookie  Patrick McCaw - a decent role player despite being a 2nd round pick. Nothing out of this world but played well and beyond expectations.  Jordan Bell - another 2nd rounder who played well above expectations, much like Pat  Eric Paschall - First team all rookie"
"It was the 2014 offseason, right before the rings. The front office wanted to make a big move and considered trading Klay, Harrison Barnes, and David Lee for Kevin Love. Jerry West blocked the deal.  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/11108483/golden-state-warriors-add-klay-thompson-possible-kevin-love-trade"
"Luke is a bad coach and they also don't have any legit good defenders. Hali is smart off-ball, Harrison Barnes is always solid, and Whiteside blocks shots sometimes, but they're lazy/undisciplined (i.e. badly coached) and don't have the individual talent to compensate, so they stop nobody"
In 2014 Dubs offered Klay and Dray for Kevin Love. Wolves wanted Klay and Harrison Barnes... deal fell through
"Clint Capella.   Ya'll act like Warriors have to hit a home run in the person they sign. They really just need someone who's an NBA starter.   When Klay, Dray, Steph are all fully healthy and you give them an actual NBA starting Center. That's already more than most teams can handle.   Wiggins is actually fine. He's a better Harrison Barnes. I wouldn't even bother trying to find an upgrade because they'd have to lose a lot."
"Look at these ""centers"" Harrison Barnes and Cameron Payne go at each other"
"The Warriors identity is as a a small ball team , meaning they are always in the market for 3&amp;D wings (think Igoudala, Harrison Barnes , Wiggins, Oubre etc) .. Grant is an excellent starting wing who's better than all of those names except prime Igoudala.  He defends multiple positions and shoots 6+ threes per game"
"He's like a better harrison barnes who maybe can't guard as large, and more of a complementary piece to the offense than KD was."
Still bothers me to this day how they let the Cavs get away with this in the 2016 Finals. That and Harrison Barnes forgetting how to play basketball.
Harrison Barnes already has a gold medal from 2016.
"""Top picks"" are overrated, first of all.    Of the past 100 top 10 draft picks ( 2009-2019 draftees ), the only 5 to even reach the Finals with their draft team are: Harrison Barnes, Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, James Harden, and Stephen Curry. And two of those wouldn't have made it without a certain free-agent acquisition.  So while building a winner high in the draft is a nice idea, its recent track record is bleak, at best.  The preceding decade was just a little better, with 7 out of 100: Westbrook, Durant, Bynum, Howard, Wade, Kenyon Martin, and Paul Pierce.  Of those 12 players, only 5 were top 3 picks and just 3 were first overall -- over 20 years.  Mediocre teams have a path to contention, and we've seen it.  It's disturbingly simple.  You build your team by drafting the best players that you can, wherever your picks fall, and by making smart trades for better players, or players that fit better.  When a ""star"" player becomes available, as they often do, you trade some of those assets for that player.  Toronto did this.  Miami did this.  Milwaukee did this.  Denver did this.  Utah did this.  None of them tanked, and none of them relied on top picks or huge free agent signings\*.  Every team in the league passed on those teams' key players in the draft.  So invest in your scouting and development operations and draft better if you want to win.  If that fails, swindle  other teams by pulling trades like Donovan Mitchell for Tyler Lydon and Trey Lyles.  &amp;#x200B;  \*Yes, Butler signed in Miami, but he also signed with Philadelphia which is not exactly South Beach, and had no problem playing in Minnesota -- and Jimmy never leaves the gym anyway."
But it's okay because they have NBA champion Harrison Barnes
A long shot is Jerami Grant. They got a good rookie class and Grant would certainly fetch a fair amount of picks from us. He wouldn’t be the number one here but he’d easily be 2 or 3.  Another one I saw on this thread was Harrison Barnes. Easily be number 2. He definitely wouldn’t be 4th in FGA/g like he was on the Kings.  In a perfect word we mortgage our picks for PG or Tobi but that’s not as realistic. I think there’s a good talking point with the Clippers starting with CJ/Nurk and picks for PG/Zubac.
Honestly Harrison Barnes would fit well with our roster and is more in line with CJs value after this playoffs.
Blake might shoot that good if we stick with Brook sagging way off him. It's essentially practice for him and he's not Harrison Barnes.
He's a better Harrison Barnes
"&gt; Smh. KP is very frustrating yes but my man, he averaged 20 and 9 THIS year.  KP also averaged a 0/0/0 in the 28 games he missed this season.  You are massively underrating Wiggins while overlooking KP's glaring defensive defencies and sketchy health.  PJ Tucker isn't replacing Wiggins and Harrison Barnes is going to cost draft assets to get.  And neither can defend guards/wings like Wiggins can.   &gt;  So you’d have a 40 million dollar scorer masquerading as a role player.   Wiggins has 2 years $65M left and KP has 3y/$100M left.   You're quite literally arguing in bad faith.  Warriors aren't going to trade what's a valuable starter for them for a worse player on a worse contract."
The kings might. I wouldn’t mind grabbing Harrison Barnes and a scrub or two
"Porzingis in THEORY is a good player. I would not bet on him playing every game either. I don’t care about the regular season, if he was even average this post season, this series would be over. The Warriors do not care about salary, if you take away Wiggins, they are still over the cap. He’s not valuable like that, not to mention, the Warriors cannot afford those guys you mentioned. I guarantee the Mavericks would rather have Wiggins than KP right now too. Wiggins averaged 18.6 points on 47/38/71 percentages with 1 block and 0.9 steals. Porzingis averaged 21 &amp; 9on 47/37/85. But Wiggins started every game and played elite defense the whole year. Anybody who can guard elite wings and guards is more valuable than someone who can’t protect the rim as a 7 footer. Also, they won a title with Harrison Barnes. So, yeah. Wiggins didn’t even take that many shots, and i’m guessing he will play even better with Klay coming back."
"Smh. KP is very frustrating yes but my man,  he averaged 20 and 9 THIS year.  Wiggins is both fools gold and easily replaceable. With Klay back half the shots that Wiggins took, Wiggins would no longer be taking. So you’d have a 40 million dollar scorer masquerading as a role player.   Instead of Wiggins you’d just need a 3 and D. And the key is the ability to slide to the 4. Which Wiggins can’t. It would be very easy to replace Wiggins. Guys like Jae crowder/PJ Tucker/Harrison Barnes. Someone like that will be available.  Not to mention, the ‘safe’ play of Wiggins isn’t winning them a title. You make that trade banking on your system gettin more out of KP"
Send Kuzma to Sacramento for Harrison Barnes and a janitor
That's a lose lose for both teams. Wiggins is just a better Harrison Barnes and they couldn't do anything with that when they had him and KP is just a spot 3pt shooter with bad defense which the Warriors have plenty of and don't need any more.
"I think KP for Harrison Barnes , Bagley, and a protected 1st would be solid"
Harrison Barnes feels the most out of place here
"Yea haha the KD Warriors are probably the GOAT team, “weak” or not, what a run.  I mean you guys could’ve gave KD money to Barnes haha. Man these guys lives are obviously awesome, but I’m not sure if I’ve ever felt as bad for Harrison Barnes during the Finals than any other player. He was still super young and there was so much pressure and he was just pure brick city."
Harrison Barnes is your guy
"No we won't be taking any player from you in this case, a 3rd team (that has the players we want, for exp the Kings with Harrison Barnes) gets involved, to which you could send Kevin Knox or whomever. That's just a random exp.  But you have may picks so you'd use one or two I think."
"""Even Harrison Barnes"" 16/7/4 on 50/39/83 splits..yeah I'd say ""Even Harrison Barnes"" elevate a lot of teams.. never mind he'd instantly slot into the Lakers 3rd best player"
"The one thing they need more than anything is a reliable ball handler or scorer for when Lebron is on the bench.  Doesn't even have to be an all star calibre player, just someone that's competent.  Even Harrison Barnes would've helped out."
Harrison Barnes?
"Oof. I'm a Raptors fan and I love DeMar, but he's not the guy you guys need to help that defense.  I think Harrison Barnes might be the best fit. Get Zach Collins back. See what happens."
Serious question  OP do you really think anyone gives a fuck about the Olympics?   There is such a lack of players who give a fuck that the 2019 team included:  Harrison Barnes Mason Plumlee Brook Lopez Derrick White and Marcus Smart
"US team that was led by Kemba and had Harrison Barnes, Plumlee, and Derrick White on the roster"
"&gt; Sadly, you have to factor in the team and what affects what, not just the names and accolades.  MMMM you're right they had to rely on back to back MVP Curry and best post season shooter Klay Thompson. Must've been real tough! /s  &gt; And they looked gassed because? That's right, it's because KD wasn't there and they weren't deep enough to spread those minutes around.  Who was their backup small/power forward when they went 73-9 or when they won the chip in 2015? Oh it was either Harrison Barnes or Kevon Looney. Well would you look at that, they had Looney in those finals against my Raptors and Jerebko who was slightly worse than Barnes was. I'd say the backups were pretty much the same as their 2015 chip...  &gt; Just pretend that the Lakers faced the Nuggets in the finals. They were a scary team with Murray playing like a superstar.  I do pretty much. That was the real NBA Finals for 2020."
I feel like they should try to get Harrison Barnes and sell the Kings on CJ being a great partner for Fox
I feel like you could've had this with Harrison Barnes.
"The mavs had Kleiber, Deandre Jordan, Harrison Barnes, trey Burke, and Tim hardaway Luka’s rookie year. The hawks had JC and who?"
Get more money long term to avoid losing value next season if he gets injured. Smart.   Harrison Barnes did the same thing and it worked out great
"Trading Wiggins is a huge mistake. The Warriors need Wiggins and honestly, there's no one else they can go get to replace him. He can score, defend, decent passer, selfless, team first player, willing to do the dirty work, and most importantly, you ALREADY HAVE HIM. Andrew Wiggins is a guy that plugs holes. Andrew Wiggins is a guy that lets you kinda sorta get back to how the Warriors looked before their team imploded from injuries. It's like the good ol' days with Harrison Barnes except I don't think Wiggins disappears in big moments like Barnes did. Wiggins has been rock solid 85% of the season."
yes. someone mediocre like Harrison Barnes would be good enough. luka literally needs someone to take some of the work load off
Harrison Barnes is the better player than Lebron James using your logic so I gave you the benefit of the doubt.
Who would they use the full TPE on? That'd have to be a sign and trade and would probably require some additional assets to whatever team is giving away a star player.  Harrison Barnes was the best case scenario for the TPE but Sacramento is too fucking stupid to blow it up
"For real. I remember this one time I was expecting my team to have a respectable record, but then they only ended up winning 7 games and clinching the worst record in NBA history. But in my head, I was thinking well at least we got the 2nd pick in the draft! Turns out that instead of drafting Bradley Beal, Damian Lillard, or even Harrison Barnes, we ended up drafting a guy whose shooting form looks like a pretzel.    Oh wait that's not my team..."
"If you thought they were bad, wait til you find out about this dude Harrison Barnes."
We didn't trade Harrison Barnes for some late first rounders. No way in hell we trade Fox for a negative asset and a couple extra picks.
"Cole Anthony, Harrison Barnes, Tony Bradley, Reggie Bullock, Ed Davis, Wayne Ellington, Danny Green, Justin Jackson, Cam Johnson, Coby White, Nassir Little, Theo Pinson"
Buddy + Harrison Barnes is something that blazers should think about
"Yeah, it says a lot about the talent of the team - or lack thereof. A lot of this is on the FO because aside from Luka and Brunson we've basically failed for the past 4-5 years to get any meaningful players through the draft or free agency. And before that, we had a 34+ year old Dirk with players like washed-Deron Williams, Raymond Felton, post-injury Wes Matthews, iso-Harrison Barnes, Andrew Bogut, etc"
Harrison Barnes in the 2016 finals. Literally a walking brick. If he had hit a couple more wide open shots per game we would’ve been champs
"I'll admit that the threat of walking is a sticky situation that distributes blame in some sense. But I do think that in an ideal world, teams are better aligned on the worth of a player. Meaning, if a player is worth $20m in a vacuum, no team would offer him $30m. If that's the case, then a team would be relatively free to offer a player whatever they're worth and be confident that they won't be upended by another team (particularly a struggling team). But in reality, a player's worth is defined by their highest offer. A player may very well be worth $20m to one team and the max to another.   It's tough. I mean, ultimately I think a team should primarily try to avoid offering a contract that'll hamper the team, but there's definitely external circumstances involved. I would still definitely argue that the situation you described is one that symptomatic of the mid-tier of players being overpaid. I mean, it's a league where Harrison Barnes, Chandler Parsons, Otto Porter can get a max contract. It seems like every team's situation would be better if everybody started being a bit more bearish."
Reverse Harrison Barnes
"Knicks are dumb if they max Randle. Best move would be trading him for a haul.   You might even be able to get a guy like Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neal or Joe Ingles. Could call the Kings about Harrison Barnes and Bagley or Hield. Ask Detroit for Jerami Grant? Try to swap him out for Wiggins &amp; FRP? Lauri and Young? Deni and Bertans? Robinson/Herro and Oladipo? Collins and Reddish? Joe Harris and Green/Brown? Hardaway &amp; Kleber or Richardson and DFS? RoCo/DJJ &amp; Powell? White and Walker? Poku and Dort?  Hayward + PJW for Randle &amp; Bullock?  Turner + Warren for Randle and Knox?  Randle + FRP for Tobias?  Randle, Quickley and Robinson + FRPs for George, Bev Oturu?"
Crowder is Harrison Barnes 2016.
"I’m with you, but as a fan, it’s really hard to watch your team pass up talent because one guy is making way more than his production dictates. See: Chandler Parsons, Harrison Barnes, KP on the mavs.   Now these guys aren’t nearly as beloved as Conley, but they got the bag when they didn’t really deserve it. And while I always cheer for guys to get paid... man it’s tough watching. At the end of the day, fans are people with complex emotions too."
they giving rj the harrison barnes treatment from 2016
Rick usually gives the people with large salaries a long leash. See Wesley Matthews and Harrison Barnes
"Currys second option is Canadian Harrison Barnes and some Gleaguers, no one blames him for losing during all-time efficient games and I don’t see how that’s bad lol  WB is shooting like sub 50 TS% on 17 PPG this series  Curry lost his playin games averaging like 38/8/4 on 50/50/95 splits lol"
It does discount it when prior to joining GSW he averaged 28.5 points in the postseason. The fact that you won't accept that those GSW teams were broke as hell is mind boggling.  They were stacked. They had 4 all stars on their team. People thought 3 all stars were broken and made the league lopsided. Yet you won't even remotely consider that KD had the easiest path to your worship then another player has ever had.  He joined a team that had the #1 and #2 most 3pt made.  Leaving Klay and Curry alone was more devasting then letting KD go off.   You are acting like it didn't take the Cavs 7 games to beat the Warriors the year prior to KD coming. You act like swapping Harrison Barnes for KD was just a side grade for that team when it literally broke the league.
KP is still a great floor spacer and he made some good passes. That being said I think I'd rather have Harrison Barnes in this series and that's concerning...
Maybe Harrison Barnes or Jerami Grant
"Let’s break it down.    2016. Steph has MCL injury Vs Rockets. Comes back. Plays hard 7 game series vs Thunder. Little known fact he re-aggregated it in game 7 vs Thunder at very end. Best offensive player that year all of a sudden can’t drive past TT or Love and his lateral movement is bad. He was hurt.    Draymond out for a game. Bogut misses end of series.   All of that and it STILL was a 7 game series that came down to the final minutes of game 7. That’s with Harrison Barnes having one of the worst shooting performances ever in the finals. He was wide open missed everything.    That’s with Lebron having the best games 5-7 maybe ever. With Kyrie playing amazing.   You’re telling me if they run it back with a healthy Steph, Draymond and bogut player every game.. that they NEED kd to win? Hell no.    A team that wins 73 games would never NEED kd. They would have been favorites in 2017 and 2018 for sure. They just would be."
"&gt; If anybody is being honest with themselves, the Warriors didn’t NEED KD to win a title. Any SF slightly better than Harrison Barnes would have been good enough.  I know it's popular to hate on KD here, but stop with this nonsense. If KD doesn't join them, they're sitting on 1 ring.   They needed each other."
"Well, it’s tough. I mean.. Curry grinded all those years. He grew with that team. He helped build a culture. Him Klay and dray were there from the start.    Kd was just a hired assassin. If anybody is being honest with themselves, the Warriors didn’t NEED KD to win a title. Any SF slightly better than Harrison Barnes would have been good enough. They just hit the jackpot. Kd didn’t have to grow with that team. He just joined.    That’s how I see it"
Hey I'm sorry but Harrison Barnes was better than what krislaps porzmingis was todayy
"He's *a VP*. Still an honor considering how young he was when he became one, but Iggy is First VP, Harrison Barnes is Secretary-Treasurer, and then there are 5 other VPs at the same level as Brown, so he isn't ""right under"" CP3"
Would they really want him? They have a star in Harrison Barnes already.
"For all their flaws as a franchise, the Mavs have a way of inspiring player loyalty that's not common in the NBA. Rick's an asshole and Donnie can be a little bit heartless (see: Barnes, Harrison) but I'll be damned if Mark Cuban isn't maybe the best owner in professional sports."
Harrison Barnes vibes
At least y’all have Harrison Barnes 2.0 aka Wiggins now 😆 He’s been good for you though for real
Crowder is Harrison Barnes 2016  Bricking so msny open shots
I would say that at least Harrison Barnes was pretty good. Obviously nowhere near KD but Barnes was a championship level player.
"When the kd announced he was going to the warriors they didn’t even have the cap space, they had to trade harrison barnes. I don’t get why they couldn’t just do that."
"I know we’re a meme but we’ve actually done pretty well on wing contracts on the last few years. Both the lavine offer sheet and the Harrison Barnes contract were both seen as awful when they were announced, and they’ve both turned into great deals."
Harrison Barnes won a ring tho
harrison barnes smiling
Is he in the same league as Harrison Barnes? Probably.  But it’ll definitely be some bottom barrel team that offers him 20M
How about…Harrison Barnes to Kevin Durant
Almost like going from Harrison Barnes to Kevin Durant.
Still misses more wide open threes than anyone I've seen besides 2016 finals Harrison Barnes.
"Rick Carlisle also plays a mean piano and did a cover of ""Maybe I'm Amazed"" at Harrison Barnes' wedding. He just built different."
"""Ow, my pride""  -Harrison Barnes"
"When our subreddit was hyped for our young ""core"" of Dennis Smith Jr, Harrison Barnes and Nerlens Noel"
"And I dont think dirk is overly liberal with his praise.  I remember when harrison barnes asked him if he might be able to play for 20 seasons and dirk was like ""you have to be really good to play 20 years"""
"Yeah I should clarify that they’re probably fans that jumped on board because of Luka and have no idea how amazing of a coach Carlisle has proved to be over the years.  A lot of those new Luka era fans failed to realize that he got on the team in the first place because we were a bad team. So they assumed that us continuing to be bad when we got Luka was because of Rick which is just....wrong. Luka is great but weve only gotten better because we significantly bolstered the roster actually got Rick some more pieces to work with. It’s already crazy to think that Luka was on a team with Dennis Smith Jr, Harrison Barnes, and Dirk - feels like ages ago."
god the harrison barnes comments in the game 6 post-game thread still absolutely fucking send me
"And you think curry would get past the rockets with Harrison barnes in 2017? or beat the 2017 cavs? Hell no. Durant joined curry sure, but don't act like curry would ever beat the cavs without injuries or get past the rockets."
Crowder is like Harrison Barnes of 2016.
Crowder pulling a 2016 Harrison Barnes right now.
Joe Harris is probably gonna cash in as a free agent the way Harrison Barnes did after playing with Golden State
Mavs legend Harrison Barnes comes back for a revenge tour. Holmes does not shore up their much needed interior defense.
"That was 2018 . But you could argue that if the 2017 Warriors had Harrison Barnes instead of KD, they would've been at risk of losing to the Spurs in WCF (Kawhi was dominating that postseason up until the Zaza injury)"
Harrison Barnes not in a slump
Harrison barnes
Gordon Hayward (and maybe Harrison Barnes if he remembered how to shoot)
"I don’t understand how this relates to the subject at hand, because we’re not discussing the Warriors without KD, we’re discussing how the team would be with Butler instead.   Also they won a title and had a 73 win season before he got there lmfao. They’d then be replacing Harrison Barnes with...a prime Jimmy Butler..."
"you know it’s normal to have to play a 7 game series, right? Like that’s a thing that teams who don’t add a superstar to a 73 win team have to go through.   They’d literally be just as good. Butler took his team to the finals without a super team. They’d be replacing Harrison Barnes with him lol"
Sometimes I wonder what basketball would have been like if Harrison Barnes could have hit an open jump shot.
"I'm not concerned. I really like what we see.   I honestly think we should look into what value James Wiseman has on the trademarket. Despite a few flashes of greatness, I just don't think he's going to pan out to be that good, nor do I think he will be an impact player during Steph Curry's window. We could bring in a few veteran players on a trade and sign a free agent center or two. They don't have to be star athletes, they just need to be fundamentally solid like Bogut and Za. No need to find a freak athlete, just somebody who can set a pick and roll, and rebound. That's all we need.  I'm hoping Klay comes back strong, and I'm not stacking the odds against him because we all know how bad he wants it. Case point, look at Durant. If he can come back at that level, we will be just fine.  As for the roster, it's shaping up well. I like a starting lineup of Draymond Green, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Andrew Wiggins. Throw in a veteran center, or Kevon Looney and you have something cooking. JTA should take off some of the pressure from Klay Thompson. He will make a great sixth man. Jordan Poole is really coming along and will make an excellent backup point guard to Curry. I'm looking forward to seeing a healthy Eric Paschal. And to be honest bringing back Kelly Oubre Jr for the right price it's probably a good move considering he had a terrible first two months of the season and still finished with 15 points average. He adds some necessary size and length off the bench at the forward position.   Don't trade Wiggins, he's only 26 and just really coming into his own. I was in awe at how well he was playing defense in the first half of that Lakers game. Hopefully he can build upon that. However, I feel like we can recreate the 15 and 16 team with Wiggins instead of Harrison Barnes. Wiggins definitely has the higher upside.   But, much of that is riding on whether or not Klay Thompson comes back healthy. Personally, I would never count him out. He has the heart of a champion and is a straight killer. As long as he is still a spot up shooter, we should have a great second option on the perimeter and somebody dangerous that you had better not leave open in order to double team Steph Curry.  We really need to tailor the game plan around Steph Curry getting double teamed, so we can find the open guy and get the best shot. Obviously this will require ball movement and ball security! Emphasize ball security! That has been our Achilles heel.   I'm crossing my fingers that we can add a 4th or 5th pick from Minnesota this year because we can add some talent with an extremely high upside, plus a building block for the future.  The entire league better be on lookout next year because the Warriors are coming full steam ahead."
Harrison Barnes type beat
He once flopped so bad against Golden State that it looked like he was hit in the chest with a shotgun blast. Harrison Barnes was about 8 feet away.
Now I see why Boston didn't want to give him up in a trade for Buddy Hield / Harrison Barnes lol
Is Harrison Barnes a different species or some shit?
He’s like a Harrison Barnes.
"It hurts to acknowledge, but the team absolutely let down Steph. The refs lined everything up for us to cruise through for a W.  Wiggo was really invisible. Did his best Harrison Barnes impersonation out there."
"They weren't kidding when they said he was the new Harrison Barnes, huh"
"If you listen to the Cav's tell it, the reason he went off is because they doubled down on Steph and Klay which left Green and Barnes. Harrison Barnes went 1-11, and so that left Draymond to have 30+ because the Cav's allowed him too.   Of course that was before the shoulder injury which left him with the ""backpack shot"". But I still don't get why he can't dunk and why he has no post-up-back-down-hook-shot."
That's 2016 Finals MVP Harrison Barnes
"Yeah he basically carried them in the first half while steph was still getting going. He had a great game and a game where he struggled a bit, and he’s probably somewhere in the middle. As long as klay isn’t completely awful after 2 years off I think he’ll thrive in the Harrison Barnes role next season"
budget kd / deluxe harrison barnes strikes again
Shades of 2016 Harrison Barnes.
Flashbacks of Harrison Barnes
"I think you're ignoring that we were a middling team last year because Klay was out. With our 2nd player back and Wiggins instead of Harrison Barnes, there's no reason to think we can't look like the 73 win Warriors. Not the KD Warriors though."
What cost us in 2016 was Harrison Barnes playing like the worst player in NBA history.
"he's basically Harrison Barnes, but with a defense"
"Wiggins was pretty good last season, though it could've been a flash in the pan. He looked like a slightly better Harrison Barnes, which is totally acceptable next to Steph Dray and (hopefully) healthy Klay."
Fournier was an expiring which severely lowered his value; Magic were going nowhere and had they decided to have a firesale a year earlier they could've gotten a couple more firsts.  As someone below mentioned - look at Aaron Gordon's trade value for a reference. Harrison Barnes isn't quite the defender that AG is but he's a competent 2-way player.
"Again, I can name 3-4 better two way wingers in the NBA. And he made 4m more than Harrison Barnes last year, that's just want 2-way wings cost.   Dudes obsessed with contracts and not actual play are the worst ""fans""."
I disagree with the premise that Harrison Barnes is the only solid small forward that is obtainable by anyone
"Honestly, Harrison Barnes.  He's a Jerami Grant-level player but Jerami Grant isn't going anywhere. If the Kangz get an opportunity to swap some of their treading-water talent with strong picks I think you do it."
"even worst case with Klay, being a secondary threat that's his size makes him at least a supercharged Harrison Barnes on both ends."
Disrespectful to Harrison Barnes
"Nah, not always  Look at Harrison Barnes, denied a 4/70m deal and got a 4/90 from the Mavs despite playing like ass in the finals  It always depends, IT would have gotten a max and denying it was fine at the time but you can't predict injuries"
you underestimate harrison barnes ability to become the second coming of michael jordan
"well, thankfully they didn't go for it, since that was harrison barnes...."
Someone like Harrison Barnes
"He did that exactly one game vs the tanking 76ers.  We almost lost that game because he was screwing around, Harrison Barnes saved us with a game winning 3, and Draymond swore never to chase stats again and hasn't.  He didn't even hunt for points when he had 4/12/10/10. He just played in the flow of the offense."
LeBron is supposed to make shots and play defense for KLove? Why didn't steph make Harrison Barnes play better in the finals? Might won it for them. Or maybe if Steph played like an actual MVP.
"Who knows if the Dubs even get to the Finals without Kerr. Iirc they blew past preseason expectations to first seed, 67-15, because they stopped replying on shit like Harrison Barnes isos."
You've got a great vet locker room guy in Harrison Barnes too
"I mentioned 30 something stars.. Lowry, Kareem etc   Most teams have rookies and bench guys who bring down the average age   Tell me what the average age of teams were those seasons and then weigh it against the champions average age.. I bet you the champions are near the oldest teams every year.   Idc if a team has bench player 9-15 aged 25 and under to bring the median age down   I only care about the major contributors and stars.   I mean Hell didn’t Harrison Barnes cost the warriors a chip? And didn’t iggy get them one?   Harrison was 24, Iggy 31.   The bulk of evidence suggests late 20s, I’m not even arguing more players in there 30s are in their prime over their late 20s, I’m saying a lot of stars are still in their primes at that age.   Yeah my point with Pip is he was more of a contributor than Toni kukoc or Jason caffey."
**SAC:** Sabonis and Justin Holiday  **IND:** Harrison Barnes and the 9th pick
"I'm talking about Mavs post 2011. Cuban hated tanking, so they kept trying to compete with an aging core, played the FA game and ended up with Harrison Barnes as your best player. That's our future game plan, unless another Luka comes along."
2016 game 7 is also weird because Draymond dropped 32 points. Not to mention Harrison Barnes went missing games 5-7. Championship teams always require players other than the number 1 and 2 options to show up
Harrison Barnes also
"And fuck, he had to. If he was just good, GS wins that title even with Steph struggling and Harrison Barnes being a Cavs player."
"People just want to complain, this is like saying if KD is available as a FA and you have cap space he says he wants to join you, do you re-sign Harrison Barnes and full search for other players? No"
Plus Harrison Barnes the double agent
"They've got an older, but more grizzled Core Three of Steph, Klay and Dray. Health will always be a factor.   Wiseman and Looney manning the middle instead of Bogut.   Oubre and Wiggins on the wings compared to Harrison Barnes/KD.  Iguodala, Livingston and Barbosa's veteran leadership and savvy play will be a big difference, but you have the Core Three taking lver that mantle. They have younger players who are high picks and gained experience the past couple years in Jordan Poole, Toscano-Anderson, Paschall, Damion Lee, Nico Mannion and now the #7 and #14 picks.   They've somehow restocked and retooled while tanking for picks. Don't see why they shouldn't be a top 5 favorite for the title if not top 3."
"The difference is Harrison Barnes isn't Ben Simmons or Kobe. It's levels to this. Ig you're supposed to be your teams 2nd best or best player and you were an all star, you can't be scared to dunk the ball while under the basket just cause you don't wanna shoot free throws."
"In 2012 I said ""Steph Curry is an amazing player, but Harrison Barnes is the future of this team.""  Ooops."
Harrison Barnes isnt Deron Williams
People always parrot this kobe quote but then you get stuff like Harrison Barnes shooting like 18% from 3 in the 2016 finals. HB didnt get scared and kept shooting with the same mindset he did all year when it was 40%. Should he have stopped and just passed the ball to someone else?
I can't  even think of a notable star in dallas in the last decade besides old old man dirk lol. They brought out the brinks truck for harrison barnes lol.. unless Carlisle is GM too that means nothing
"he has a wiggins/harrison barnes vibe to him, so maybe."
"&gt; Luka Doncic is r/NBA’s golden boy. He can do no wrong. He takes 7 inefficient step-back threes a game, stat pads triple doubles, shoots tons of free throws and yells about foul calls. To r/NBA this makes him “a stud” and “built different.” They love him unconditionally. Meanwhile, James Harden plays this same style of basketball. Everything I just said to describe Luka’s play could be said about Harden equally. They must love him too, then… right? If you’re familiar with nbacirclejerk (which I assume you are if you’re reading this) then you might have an idea of what’s coming here. In my research I found a few recent (within the year) instances of r/NBA users claiming the Rockets could only beat teams using the refs. Going further back into the sub, there’s lots of people in game threads, post game threads, etc. calling Harden a “flopper” a “chucker” a “bitch” and a “choker.” I even found two comments that said “I hate [Harden] as a person.” (It’s odd to me how r/NBA seems to assume they know players on a personal level, but that’s a topic I’ve covered in previous posts.) Harden clearly gets different treatment from r/NBA than Doncic, despite the two of them playing eerily similar ways, and acting relatively the same in regards to foul calls. So what’s different between the two of them to cause this? Is it the team they play for? The Rockets don’t seem to be particularly well liked, but the Mavericks do recently. So that’s it, problem solved right? No. As one person in r/NBA puts it, “the Mavs didn’t have this many fans when Harrison Barnes was their best player.” r/NBA doesn’t have any deep spiritual connection with the Mavericks that causes them to love all their players. So why is Doncic so loved and Harden so hated? **Well, to be quite frank, Doncic is white**. It has to be said that r/NBA loves white players."
why would you exclude Harrison Barnes?
I hate how people act as if Harrison Barnes was a bust for us just because of his performance in the 2016 finals. He was a very important part of our core when our team finally started to turn a corner and not suck anymore
Harrison Barnes isn't even that bad bro lol
Hilarious part is the guy they tanked hard for and were super hyped up about was Harrison Barnes himself. He was supposed to be the crown jewel they shamelessly tanked that season to get that spot
"Why would you exclude Harrison Barnes when you're listing the last two? This is dumb, even compared to your usual posts."
The last player the Golden State Warriors picked with the seventh pick include Harrison Barnes if you exclude Steph Curry and Chris Mullin. Do you think the Golden State Warriors will get lucky with the seventh pick this season?
"It would have been different if the Warriors had to give up equal compensation, not just a high first rounder. Past-prime CP3 on one of the biggest contracts in the league, got a blossoming star in Oubre, a valuable vet in Rubio, two young players, and a first rounder.   KD, being well in his prime in 2016, would need a PG13 (Gallo + 5 1st rounders) or Harden (Levert, Jarrett Allen, 3 1st rounders, 4 1st round swaps) level of return to be traded for. The fact that the best team in the league was able to sign a top 3 player as a free agent is laughable, similar to if Lebron went to the Celtics in 2011 or if Kawhi went to the Lakers a couple years ago.  And no, Harrison Barnes wasn't seen as good enough for a max, he got $94 million over 4 years. Certainly a lot, but not a max. He also choked badly in the Finals (2 for 14, 0 for 8, 3 for 10 in the last three games), and was heavily ridiculed, similar to how Ben Simmons is right now.  The problem isn't that the Warriors were too good. It's that they were a great contending team with a homegrown core, until they went and upset the balance of the league by signing another top 3 player without having to give up significant parts of that core, or giving up their draft future."
I too do not understand the Harrison Barnes hype
Firing Dave Joerger was a mistake.  Trade Harrison Barnes you cowards.
"Oh right. Knowing Harrison Barnes now that's very on brand for Barnes, but Lacob can't be thinking of basketball players the same way he did candidates he was interviewing while a partner at Booz Allen or Kleiner Perkins."
Also that Harrison Barnes arrived to the draft interview in a suit and tie and Lacob liked that
"As a Cavs fan, I feel compelled to point out that Harrison Barnes was also a 7th pick by the Warriors."
If anything the Warriors got Steph Curry with 7th… and Harrison Barnes.
"Klay was an 11th pick, Curry 7th, Harrison Barnes with the 7th pick, heck Micheal Porter Jr. was selected with the 14th pick though his back surgeries really caused him to drop.  Warriors will definitely have a could shots at a talented player. I'm excited!"
It’s been good for the warriors imo. Stephen Curry and Harrison Barnes?
Yeah Cavs legend Harrison Barnes
Harrison Barnes?
"2019 Coby White, North Carolina – Chicago Bulls   2018 Wendell Carter Jr., Duke – Chicago Bulls   2017 Lauri Markkanen, Arizona – Minnesota Timberwolves   2016 Jamal Murray, Kentucky – Denver Nuggets   2015 Emmanuel Mudiay, Guangdong Tigers – Denver Nuggets   2014 Julius Randle, Kentucky – Los Angeles Lakers   2013 Ben McLemore, Kansas – Sacramento Kings   2012 Harrison Barnes, North Carolina – Golden State Warriors   2011 Bismack Biyombo, Congo – Sacramento Kings   2010 Greg Monroe, Georgetown – Detroit Pistons     2/10 times in the last 10 years the picks actually hit at 7, would I give up someone like Ben Mclemore and Wiggins for Dlo? Sure"
"So the Warriors' last two picks at #7 were Harrison Barnes and Steph Curry.  Not bad for either, but let's hope for Curry."
"It makes sense looking in the past 15 years where they couldn't attract the top free agents when they cleared cap, instead they had to settle with Chander Parsons and the Harrison Barnes tier of players."
"Odom was depressed and on drugs while he was here... I'm not entirely sure what else Carlisle could've done. He tried to work with him and put him in positions to succeed but at the end of the day Lamar Odom did not want to be here.   Rondo he was a hard ass with, but to Rick's credit, we were like 25-10 prior to the Rondo trade, on pace for a 58-60 win season, our best since the Championship. We trade for Rondo and he wanted full control of the offense, despite what we had already been doing being effective. We finish the year like 25-20 under Rondo and limp to a 50 win record despite the very good start. Yes Carlisle butted heads with Rondo, but Carlisle showed he was producing more wins that the Rondo led offense.   Tyson wanted to come back, so did Carlisle and Dirk, Cuban ultimately passed on Tyson twice. What was Rick supposed to do? Buy the team from Cuban and re-sign Tyson himself? They all lobbied for Tyson to stay, Rick publicly called him the best Center in Mavericks history.   Players have been vocal about not liking him, which is valid, but the three examples you provided are not great. All of them were either out of his control, or in the case of Rondo, his approach proved to lead to better wins.   Also we lost in 4 to the eventual Western Conference Champions in 4, but it was one of the closest sweeps ever. We lost 3 of the games by a combined 10 or so points. G1 was a last second buzzer beater from 3 by Durant, then the other two were like 4-5 point losses. Not to mention we had lost Tyson and our starters were 32-37 years old playing in a condensed season and fatigued a lot more than the younger Thunder. Did you watch the series or did you go to basketball reference and see we got swept and assumed Rick was a bad coach? Like I said, the series was a lot closer than the outcome suggests, look at the boxscore and play by play, super close games and we had leads in the 4th quarter in 3 of the 4 games, OKC was a great team that year. Go watch the 2014 first round series or the 2016 first round series. Rick coached circles around the 61 win Spurs and took them to 7 with Samuel Dalembert, Jose Calderon and old Dirk as his best players. 2016 we stole a game from the best team the Thunder have put together while starting fat Raymond Felton, Zaza Pachulia, 37 year old Dirk and Wes Matthews his first year back from his torn ACL. Rick has coached some pretty mediocre teams to the playoffs and made the series way more competitive than they should've been. This was largely due to stay competitive during Dirk's twilight to his career. If we had full on rebuilt Rick wouldn't have had those first round exits.   Lastly, you can fault Rick for a lot of things but not getting enough out of role players is the absolute last thing on that list. He has made so many washed up or mediocre players look great in his system. Old Raymond Felton and Mike James, Brandon Wright, Deron Williams, Brandon Bass, Dwight Powell, Justin Anderson, Dennis Smith Jr., Yogi Ferrell, Roddy Beauboius, DeShawn Stevenson, JJ Barea... All of those guys were out of the league or way worse the second they left the Mavs. Carlisle is an incredible coach at getting every inch out of role players. I'd argue his worst trait is his inability to manage star egos. He lucked out that Dirk had no ego or even Harrison Barnes, but he's struggled with players who had egos/tempers, Chandler Parsons, Luka, Salah Mejri etc...   No one is saying Rick is perfect and he's very much an old coach in a new coaches world, but do you even watch him? All of your critiques are not really true."
"There was Harrison Barnes tho, who while he was in the league for a few years, was still weird looking back"
I wasn’t sad when the Warriors replaced Harrison Barnes with KD.  I imagine Lakers fans felt the same.
We aren’t the Warriors and comparing us to the Warriors is stupid. Comparing Hunter to Harrison Barnes is also stupid. Hunter has all-defense potential while also having potential to be a 20 PPG scorer. That’s way better than Harrison Barnes ever has been
He is their Harrison Barnes
"Bruh the top voted trades in this thread:  Minny: Beasly + Rubio + 1st  Kings: Literally Harrison Barnes  Spurs: Derozan who is a FA. They really think White + S&amp;T DeRozan is worth Simmons  These people are insane. I mean, people got pissed at me for saying Brogdon + (Warren or Turner) + 1st, but at least that trade solves the Sixers issues and Brogdon is legit a great player. These trades all just makes Philly way way worse."
"Yes, the value of Ben Simmons is at its absolute lowest right now but that doesn’t mean fucking Harrison Barnes lmfao. Not even a sixers fan but c’mon man."
Think for your self. Is Wiggins going to make 76ers better? No. They will rather trade for Harrison Barnes than Wiggins
"Funny enough, if Harrison Barnes shrunk and didn’t shoot or passed those shots up back to Curry or Klay or even Draymond at the time, they would have done better. That was literally the worst performance I’ve ever seen by Barnes."
Kings trade Harrison Barnes for Ben Simmons? Who says no?
Then you don't watch the games. Wiggins has been perfect for us if you consider he will be playing with Steph and Klay next year. We won 73 games with Harrison Barnes in that role. He's better and younger than Barnes.
"I usually love team games but man, there are few things more frustrating than the truth behind the saying “it takes 5 people to win a game but 1 to lose it”. This series reminds me of how the Cavs transition defense came alive in the 2016 finals when they realized they could basically just leave Harrison Barnes wide open every play."
This is a smart decision. Not just for healing but just to work on your game. Playing 10 minutes on team USA steam rolling the competition is like playing 2K on easy. You’ll gain as much as Harrison Barnes did from the experience. Work on your game in the off season and come back with new moves and skills.
"Harrison Barnes missed open shots. It was a choke, but that happens all the time. Joe Harris this season, for example.  Simmons was too scared to throw down a wide open dunk. We gotta emphasize how unprecedented that is lol"
You just have to look over at what Harrison Barnes did :cry:
"Wiggins for KD or for Harrison Barnes, either one is fine"
I would think more like Harrison Barnes and whatever filler would make it work along with the sixers sending picks.
Ben Simmons absolutely pulled a Harrison Barnes 2015-2016 Finals performance disappearing act…except that he isn’t a 4th option.
"It sucks bc the fit is great.. it’s just over paying Collins now mean you won’t get to pay the other guys like Hunter and Huerter when they’re due for it..  Can Okongwu play the 4?   I guess trade Collins to the Thunder for picks if they’re interested in building around Shai, Dort Collins.. or the Kings for Harrison Barnes?"
"Heres a mock trade: Simmons for Fox and Barnes.   Philly gets a championship experienced wing in Harrison Barnes who can hit 3s and play fine defense, with a dynamic star PG that can work well with Embiid in PnR and get his own shot.  Sac gets their franchise guy who they can build around. This series was horrible for Ben, but he's still an all star caliber player with an All NBA ceiling who still has untapped potential, plus new change of scenery could work wonders for him."

I’m a better basketball player than Ben Simmons. Straight up. Harrison Barnes and Festus Ezeli are somewhere right now wondering if he’s point shaving
Tobias Harrison Barnes
"I pay attention to international basketball and international competitions. That's why I know that this USA roster is already much better than that year's American roster. Americans that led in minutes in that game: Kemba, Harrison Barnes, Donovan Mitchell, Myles Turner, Khris Middleton."
Serbia beat USA by five points with Myles Turner and Harrison Barnes starting. There was never a chance this year
"To me, everyone but Seth. And even if he pulls a 2016 Harrison Barnes today, he should get only 2% of the blame, at most. For Embiid, only 4% if he sucks today.  Shake and Maxey get 25% if they suck. Harris gets 50%. Everyone else gets 100%.   Atlanta looked dead in Game 4 and 5. Series should’ve been over in 5."
Harrison Barnes flashbacks
Wish Mark Jackson said something similar about Harrison Barnes during the Finals
I mean this shows the importance of role players not shitting the bed. If KD had any sort of help from Harris the series is over in 6. Harrison Barnes would be proud. Bucks also could blame Jrue's shooting woes but he did have to guard kyrie and KD. But still being the 3rd best scored demands more and the bucks need jrue to shoot better to win a chip.
Joe Harrison Barnes
Joe Harrison Barnes?
"Joe “Harrison Barnes” Harris, my man"
Shades of Harrison Barnes
Pretty sure no one could foresee Joe Harris turning into the second coming of Harrison Barnes. Dude was legit straight trash.

Harrison Barnes flashbacks
He Harrison Barnes the Nets this series
Pulled a Harrison Barnes
No no no no. He was Harrison Barnes in 2016 level bad. I don’t think he can come back to Brooklyn to play next season - there’d be headhunters looking for his ass all season lol
He was looking like 2016 Harrison Barnes out there
"It's Game 7, most players are tired. Only Harrison Barnes definitively crumbled that entire series."
With Harrison Barnes starting?
"Donovan Mitchell, Derrick White, Kemba Walker, Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, Mason Plumlee, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Harrison Barnes, Marcus Smart, and Joe Harris.  Not the best team we could have sent, but they definitely should have finished better than 7th."
"Probably worse? Bruh it’s obviously worse. That team had joe Harris, Derrick white, Marcus smart, Harrison barnes, mason plumlee, kemba, Myles turner, and brook lopez. The only players on that team that are on the level of any player on this team were Mitchell, tatum, brown, and Middleton"
No they’re not lol  Harrison barnes couldnt in the finals and hes better than any of these guys
"In hindsight I'm kind of sad we couldn't run back pre KD Warriors vs Cavs a couple more times. I wonder what our FO does to get better if we didn't get KD because we damn well sure weren't gonna max Harrison ""Brick"" Barnes."
"I don't get how Buddy is seen as ""not a starter"" by so many people??  If JJ Redick could start on super good Clippers *and* Sixers teams, there is absolutely no reason Hield as an even better shooter and much bigger player shouldn't be seen as the same. He hit 4 threes a game last year on 39%. And nobody can call him a great defender but it's not like Sacramento is in any position to make him look anything but bad with the system and players around him.   Some of these comments are talking about Harrison Barnes being a better option, but how does that make any sense?? I just don't understand and would like someone to explain."
"Not happening. Besides Fox and Haliburton, the Kings' player I'd value the most is Harrison Barnes, not Buddy Hield. Adams isn't going anywhere, partly because of what he brings and partly because of contract extension trade rules. The player would have to be Bledsoe."
"No shit Curry is a better offensive player,  but iggy was the 2nd leading scorer WHILE holding lebron to dogshit efficiency (sure his back was killing him and he was likely just tired from carrying that team to the finals) but it's still credit to iggy. say you have a bum guarding lebron like harrison barnes. how tf you even gonna say lebron wouldn't have muscled his way to the basket easily and let the cavs role players hit some 3s with that space?"
Trade Harrison Barnes you cowards
"This guy could have had Steph, Klay, and Dray instead he  got Eric Bledsoe 2.0 and Harrison Barnes."
"When a team is missing.open looks then yeah, it's obviously over. You shoot open shots, you have to.* Harrison Barnes shot the Warriors to death in that 3-1 comeback, because you just can't stop shooting.  *Ben Simmons is excluded from this logic, but is also the absolute poster boy for exactly why you SHOOT THE OPEN FUCKING SHOT."
Harrison Barnes shot himself out of a max in the finals.
Middleton giving me mad Harrison Barnes 2016 vibes
Jrue Holiday doing a 2016 Harrison Barnes impression.
"it all depends on what % of old klay they can get, if he's 100% the player he used to be maybe they can make a decent playoff run  but paying klay almost 40 million dollars if he's 50% or 75% of the player he used to be is disastrous for them  I think a top 3 team is off the table, that team that won 73 games is gone all the depth they had either got too expensive or retired.    That depth that was enabled by paying MVP steph 11 million dollars and draymond 14 million.   No more shaun livingston or iguodala or harrison barnes rounding out their starting rotation.  No more bogut or david lee.  They had to give steph klay and dray massive contracts instead.  Other teams have been getting a lot better in the interim years, clippers lakers suns are all threats to make the finals.  Can the GSW core be better than them?  It's tough"
"How does that tweet contradict what /u/lakerswiz said about LeBron giving his opinion? And LeBron isn't a vice president of the NBAPA (his term expired 2.5 years ago). [Here's the player leadership:](https://nbpa.com/leadership)  * Chris Paul, President * Andre Iguodala, First VP * Harrison Barnes, Secretary-Treasurer * Bismack Biyombo, VP * Malcolm Brogdon, VP * Jaylen Brown, VP * Kyrie Irving, VP * CJ McCollum, VP * Garrett Temple, VP  LeBron isn't even the Lakers' rep (that's Jared Dudley, with Alex Caruso as alternate)."
I could see him averaging over 20 ppg on the Kings with Fox still being their best player. But Harrison Barnes would need to get moved.
"Harrison “Black Falcon” Barnes, tho?"
Harrison Barnes definitely not likable after the 2016 finals
"To be clear, you’re suggesting that the greatest team of all time *lost* in the Finals? And you think they got worse the next year when they replaced Harrison Barnes with Durant?   Right."
Warriors fans probably beg to differ on Harrison Barnes
My feelings toward Harrison Barnes have not been well since the 2016 finals
I don’t like Harrison Barnes.
"They aren’t the greatest team of all time lmao.  The team that was made the next year was. Do you really think that the Harrison Barnes warriors are winning 7 vs the KD squad?  Do you think they even take 2 games off of them? For reference, the superteam warriors rolled the cavs in 5 as opposed to the 7 game loss that they had one year earlier."
"Iggy and Draymond’s offensive creation is entirely dependent on the threat of Steph and Klay’s shooting. They aren’t playmakers, they’re passers. And what about Harrison Barnes? I guarantee you nobody is sweating over any offense led by Barnes. Thompson is the only 20+ point scorer out of those dudes so Idk wym by they have 3 20 point scorers outside of Steph and even then Klay is notoriously bad at creating for himself and others relative to star players. Plus Game Score? Is that the end all be all for u? Steph has a 17.9 game score for the series and Iggy’s was 13.6. The gap between their scores is the virtually same as the gap between Iggy and Klay’s performances and the fact that you’re acting like 59% true shooting is poor efficiency is laughable (especially considering that’s exactly what Iggy had too and you called that efficient). Also when was Steph’s defense an issue at any point that series? The fact that you’re calling 2015 Iggy, Dray, and Harry B legit 20 point scorers makes me think your borderline trolling rn."
"lol well if your position is trade CJ for Butler then sure, you've solved your problem. But you're not getting Butler. CJ's efficiency isn't astronomical because he's bad at getting to the line, agree with you there. If he could average 6 FTs a game he'd be a true star but he's not explosive or big enough. But his offensive impact is very very good. Look at any on/off, +/-, WAR, etc. stat you want. He's up there with elite guys.  If you think you're replacing that with Norm or someone of his caliber bc you had a stretch where Lillard had to kill himself to keep the team afloat without CJ, good luck. The benefit of CJ is he can give Lillard a break. Get rid of CJ and you'll have no secondary ballhandler or scoring option. Dame's not scoring 40 a night all season. He can do that in stretches to cover for guys, but it's not going to work long-term.  And this is the problem with CJ trades: you can keep braying on about how he's not good enough and should go, but what are you getting back? Replacing him with cheap parts, which is really the only option most people see, isn't going to help the team. You're looking at Harrison Barnes, Josh Richardon/Maxi Kleber type deals. Maybe Jerami Grant, probably not. Good luck with Ben Simmons lol.  And part of ""showing up"" is being productive in the regular season. It's hilarious that people reduce players to playoff losses. How do you think teams get to the playoffs? CJ's been a huge part of keeping the Blazers highly competitive year in and year out with very few quality players around him and Dame.  CJ isn't a good defender, but he's not the reason the entire team stinks on that end. What the Blazers need is to not play the worst defenseive bench imaginable: Simons, Melo and Kanter. That's what sunk the team in the playoffs. They were beyond awful. Totally unplayable. Abused by other starters and backups. Flipping at least two of those guys out for quality rotation pieces who can offer even marginal defensive resistance improves the Blazers significantly. You can't have Paul Millsap destroying you in the playoffs at like 37. That's where I'd start this offseason."
Well I mean they did replace Harrison Barnes with Kevin Durant
"Harrison Barnes for me. Man turned down an extension in the 2015 offseason acting like he deserved more money, then proceeded to barf all over himself in the finals. Deuces."
Harrison Barnes in the Finals
Lol I’d easily take Harrison Barnes over Oubre. At least Barnes doesn’t have an ego. Oubre started off the season like 2016 finals Harrison Barnes. He was shooting terribly and inconsistent but worst is his tunnel vision where he tries for the highlight or bucket instead of passing to open guys or Steph.   In what ways is he better than Draymond? He’s only a better scorer and that’s it.
"The elephant in the room is he’s a better player than Draymond. He had a bad year but I remember he was part of some extortion plot early in the year, he had some stuff going on off the floor when he was playing like ultra bad. He’s an average player right now though, he’s got a lot of tools. I’ll give him that, he’s gotta go somewhere where they believe in him and buy into his role and he could turn into a real player. He’s got range on defense and he’s a talented player.   I think he’s about as good as Harrison Barnes in all seriousness, I think Barnes is overpaid though."
"I remember Harrison Barnes saying the first time he has to guard LeBron, he felt like he was playing in slow motion by how fast LeBron was for his size"
"Oh I actually have this one. I'm 6'6, decently athletic, never played past high school. Went to UNC basketball camp while Harrison Barnes was there being recruited. He was scrimming with the camp during the day but was scrimming against like Hansbrough and the recent NCAA champions at night. Anyways, he was guarding me. I literally couldn't go past him in either direction. Not like I couldn't blow by him. I mean I literally couldn't like go anywhere. And I could tell he wasn't trying, he just was like moving back and forth lmfao. I like to think at my peak, which was a few years later, I could've done a little better, but still. And this was him as a HS senior (albeit ranked #1 and was considered the most pro ready HS player)."
"I scored 4 points in a game I was defended by Taylor Coppenwrath. He later played at the University of Vermont and led them to an upset over Syracuse in the tourney. He came close to playing in the NBA, but never made it. Maybe I could get one on Harrison Barnes, anything over two would just be from throwing up a miracle shot and getting lucky."
There was a question going around on Twitter a year or so ago about how many points people thought they could score on Harrison Barnes one on one. Way too many people said more than 0
He gave Harrison Barnes a cheap shot in FIBA World Cup and almost started a fight.
"(Fake) Rumor has it Utah was going to trade the nickname and their #1 pick via GSW to New Orleans for #1 overall in 2012, and the rights to name their team something bee related (beehive state is utah...)  Golden State fucked it up by tanking the rest of the way so they could keep the pick and get Harrison Barnes. It rolled over a year later and Jazz flipped the pick (Gorgui Dieng) with Shabazz Muhammad to get Trey Burke (oooof)  We could've had the Utah Hornets hanging up their 4th banner next week with AD, Mitchell, Gobert, and Hayward wouldn't have ever left.  And y'all could be making Miles Davis memes and making your Zion dunk plays of the game with Baker Street playing in the background.  I blame Mark Jackson"
"How did the Warriors inform him when the Warriors prior to that year offered Harrison Barnes a 74m deal that would mean they have literally no cap space lmao  Warriors just simply got lucky because Barnes rejected it and the cap spiked, there is no conspiracy theory here they didn't know a year prior   They lost the finals, Barnes plays like shit, KD is available and cap spikes, it's a perfect storm for them none of it had a chance to happen a year prior"
"You know who lead the league in scoring?!! Stephen “The Baby-Faced Assassin!” Have you seen the GSW? Steph, Klay, Green (2nd rd), Poole, Paschal (also 2nd rd),Looney, Wiseman all draft picks! That’s 4/5 starters, our #1 bench option (JP) not to mention EP, Nico (who’s tearing it up for Italy) maybe Jessup, all home grown picks! Plus JTA and Damion Lee who we sifted through the G league dirt to find those diamonds in the rough! I would hard pressed to see a team with that much draft capital and that much success! We used to be bottom, bottom shelf! Easily avg 50 losses a year, until we drafted a special lil scrawny light skinned green eyed killer! So here’s the first point I think you missed! You need a corner stone to build your foundation on. Booker could be that guy, but right now it’s CP3. Without him the suns are avg at best. Same with the W’s and no Curry. With Steph, and maybe fortunately unfortunately, we had Nelly at helm and his run and gun offense helped develop Steph’s confidence, but also a lot of losses! After that we moved Monta for Bougut, drafted Klay, Dray and young Harrison Barnes and the rest as they say, is history. And since we are here how many careers have the GSW resurrected? We got David Lee a chip, D. West, Livingston, Iggy, Cousins’, Barbosa, and made KD a god! We take others left over and turn them into a delectable 5 star meal! And while I’m here where’s the love for Kerr? All this Ty Lue talk about his adjustments?!! Really PG13 and Kawaii, last time LBJ and Co. it’s not like his rosters ain’t stacked! Anyways not sure what leading your team in scoring has to do with staying with one team but yeah no one has done it like the Warriors! Next year with a healthy Klay we will be dominant, and reign supreme once again! 😈 muuuhahahajahahhh that’s all carry the hell on!"
"Curry, klay, Harrison Barnes, and draymond were all draft by golden state as well."
"Do you think any of them will be better than prime Harrison Barnes, who’s comparable in terms of measurables? I guess Bridges is basically there already."
Richard Jefferson did a worse choke job than Harrison Barnes that year
Harrison Barnes didn't like him either
&gt; and then replacing Harrison Barnes with Kevin Durant  I'm still not capable of processing such a transition hahaha  Like what even is that sentence.  I still can't believe he was on the Warriors. That they really won 73 games then up and got Kevin Durant lol
"Then they did they exact same thing a few years later with firing Joerger after he got them to their best record in ten years to hire Luke Walton, who might be the worst coach left in the NBA (and also giving Harrison Barnes 20 mil a year that summer)"
"Trust me it has little to do with the flair mate. You could change your flair right now to the Pistons or something and I’m confident that you’d still get a ton of people shitting on you for arguing that.   It was a softer than baby shit move and I say that as someone who completely supports and defends LeBron/Bosh going to Miami together, PG/Kawhi going to LAC together, Durant/Kyrie going to BK together (if anything I’d shit on Harden for trying to tack himself on top of that to get a ring by eating his way out of Houston and acting like a fucking degenerate because he’s a bitch), AD going to LA with Bron, and any other example I’m forgetting. I am one of the biggest supporters of player movement and I still have no defense for that move because there is none…  73 win team has space for a max offer because of a cap spike from a TV deal leading to a top 15 all-time player hitting FA and tacking himself right on top of said 73 win team in place of Harrison Barnes right after blowing a 3-1 lead head to head against said 73 win team. Everything about it was completely unprecedented and absurd and now all we can do is hope nothing similar ever happens again unless it happens for the Knicks."
"The Heat were only favored twice in the Finals in their 4 years. It wasn't nearly on the level of the KD Warriors. I mean they were a 73 win team and they replaced Harrison Barnes with fucking KD, that shit is insane"
"Turns out, having a homegrown team that was about to repeat and then replacing Harrison Barnes with Kevin Durant will make you better. Who would have guessed?"
This one seems more accurate except the Kuminga/Harrison Barnes one.  Harrison is very athletic but does not use it aggressively and is a much better shooter.
"1. Cade - less athletic Grant Hill  2. Mobley - more defensive minded Chris Bosh   3. Green - 75% of Bradley Beal, better defender   4. Suggs - Tall, athletic Lowry with less ass   5. Kuminga - Very athletic Harrison Barnes   6. Barnes - Diet Draymond Green   7. Moody - TJ Warren with better defense   8. Keon - Shanon Brown with a better jumper  9. Sengun - Sabonis lite  10. Mitchell - offensively competent Kris Dunn   11. Bouknight - Nickiel Alexander-Walker   12. Kispert - Doug McDermott  13. Giddey - Unathletic rookie Lonzo Ball"
"Definitely. Kyrie was on the 2016 team with Draymond, Klay, and Harrison Barnes although there was a one month gap from game 7 to the start of team USA training camp"
"Man, pj tucker turning to harrison barnes"
"All 4 of his rings are equally legit and anyone who thinks LeBron, Wade, and Bosh should’ve felt obligated to keep wasting years with absolutely no shot to win the title in the situations they were all in in 2008-2009 instead of forming a big 3 of their own to counter Boston’s because “BoStON tRaDeD fOr Kg aNd AlLeN BrUh” is a fucking moron. All that matters from the player’s basketball perspective is that they had 3 stars (and later a 4th with Rondo) when they stepped on the basketball court. Bron, Wade, and Bosh did absolutely nothing wrong and they did something that many fantastic teams before them were unable to do and that’s win back to back titles. Congratulations to those 3 boys.  In Cleveland he beat the 73-9 Warriors with Kevin Love averaging 8 points on 35% shooting in the finals (not to mention the year before when Love got hurt in the 1st round and Kyrie got hurt in game 1 of the finals and LeBron singlehandedly pushed the Warriors to 6 games with the sorriest group of turds to ever play in the finals). So trying to discredit that ring with sUpErTeAm is equally as dumb as thinking that big 3s are only allowed to be formed via trade and not free agency. Congratulations to those boys and the city of Cleveland.   The Lakers 3rd best player in their title season last year was either KCP or Dwight Howard. “BuBbLe BruH iT wAs ThE BuBBlE MicKEy MoUSe BrUh.” The bubble fucked the Lakers over as it took away the very important 1 seed homecourt advantage they earned all year. As the great Giannis said before the playoffs, that was actually the HARDEST ring you could possibly win. Congratulations to all those boys.  The only actual meaningless rings in recent memory are Kevin Durant’s 2 in Golden State. He literally just added himself on top of a team coming off a 2 season stretch with 140 regular season wins, back to back finals appearances, and a ring without him. Just tacked himself on top of a ready made machine in place of Harrison f*****g Barnes. Obviously the part where he had just blown a 3-1 lead to them was the cherry on top. And fuck me, even in 2019 they swept the WCF without him and were on the verge of forcing a game 7 in the finals before Klay got hurt. They still might’ve won the chip without him that year if Klay didn’t get hurt lol. The hilarious part is the schmucks who shit on LeBron’s rings in Miami are the same idiots who try to say that KD is as good or better than LeBron lol. Not to mention KD had Russ and Ibaka from day 1 in OKC and then also got a few years of Harden while LeBron’s best teammates in Cleveland were Zydrunas Ilgauskas and 2 years of Mo Williams.  LeBron James (nor anyone else in league history) has ever done anything remotely similar to that as he has never played on a team that would have a fucking prayer in hell to win the title, make the finals, or win 73 games without him if you replaced him with Harrison Barnes. Miami could’ve been a 2nd round playoff team and that’s about it. Fuck KD and hopefully we don’t see that ever again.  Tl;dr: Fuck the original Boston big 3 and many thanks to the Miami big 3 for coming together to shit on them. Also Fuck KD and he’ll never be Bron."
"I think he is better than ""I forgot how to shoot in the finals"" Harrison Barnes."
Token role player. It was Harrison Barnes in 2016.
No he didn’t. The Warriors offense got shut down the last three games because the Cavs used the Tony Allen strategy on Harrison Barnes and after Bogut got hurt they had to go small which led to them getting dominated in the paint and on the boards.
harrison barnes does sometimes
Also Harrison Barnes probably made like 2 shots in that entire series......
You are never going to get equal value. Brogdon makes that team better tho right? I also understand philly not wanting picks in win now mode. Maybe repackage it for a vet? Anybody want our Harrison Barnes?
"The 2019 world cup roster:  Derrick White, Donovan Mitchell, Joe Harris, Marcus Smart, Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Mason Plumlee, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Kemba Walker"
"**2014 select team**  * Harrison Barnes, Golden State Warriors * Trey Burke, Utah Jazz * Jimmy Butler, Chicago Bulls * Draymond Green, Golden State Warriors * Tim Hardaway Jr., New York Knicks * Tobias Harris, Orlando Magic * Doug McDermott, Chicago Bulls * Victor Oladipo, Orlando Magic * Mason Plumlee, Brooklyn Nets * Miles Plumlee, Phoenix Suns * Marcus Smart, Boston Celtics * Dion Waiters, Cleveland Cavaliers * Cody Zeller, Charlotte Hornets  where?"
Would the warriors trade for Harrison Barnes?
 Harrison Barnes
Cade is not some next level type of playmaker like you’re making him out to be. He averaged more turnovers then assist this year. I think where he is gonna shine in the NBA is his scoring like you said he has shown that he can score at all three levels in college. I think he’ll be a better version of Harrison Barnes in the league tbh (which is an allstar caliber player). But I hope I’m wrong and he turns into a superstar. I’d like to see the Pistons get someone they can build around.
"Yes. And they still could have lost with Klay. But they had no chance without him. Stacked or not, that was the team we had, and injuries affected who won. What people don't seem to realize is that before we had KD, we had Harrison Barnes. When we lost KD to injury, we didn't have either. So we were playing a bench player at that position. Not trying to take anything away from the Raptors but every championship has injury issues. We beat LeBron the first time without Kevin Love and Kyrie."
"He's had some truly shitty rosters in Dallas.  Between Dirk falling off and Luka coming on it was pure garbage.  Like a couple of those teams were banking on Harrison Barnes being a #1 option.  Even now, with Luka, it's a really weak roster.  KP is oft-injured and full of all sorts of problems.  And the roster doesn't go very deep.  Yet he's still winning 57% and 58% of his games last two years, in the West.    Pending any major moves by Dallas this offseason, I think everybody is about to see just what Carlisle was doing for that team.  Really the front office for Dallas has been awful.  Even during Dirk's peak they never did a truly great job of building around him.  Never got another star on board and focused too much on past their peak vets."
I would like it to be known that this is what it was like watching Harrison Barnes not take an extension then go like 4-30 from 3 in the 2016 finals.
"Kevin Durant should have an asterisk next to each ring he has. Asterisk should just say” warriors were already a 70 win team with Harrison Barnes.” Any one better than Harrison Barnes also would’ve won a title.  Paul George, kawaii  siakin derozan,Ingram, Tatum, Middleton, Butler, James , all could’ve won if they had that talent. In my mind he’s still ringless."
"Most players take a jump their 2nd year in the league, by next seasons playoffs Wiseman can definitely be a positive impact player for them. Chris Paul is 36 looking like he's about to go the finals and I think Curry is aging better than CP.   And if Wiseman develops into the kind of talent I think he can, if they land on a future star with the 7th or even 14th pick (Curry was a 7th pick, Harrison Barnes a 7th, Klay an 11th) who can contribute some during their rookie contract while growing into a star we could see a Tim Duncan type thing where old man Curry is helping the young guys win rings the last few years of his career.   You don't get lots of lotto picks in loaded drafts, you've got to use them. Most of the time the player you select will have more trade value than the pick you used to select them anyway."
Not exactly true. Jackson became 1/2 of the Harrison Barnes trade for us.
"30 teams, 5 starters per, that's 150 starters... I'm not gonna make a list, but Harrison Barnes is probably somewhere in the top 65-85 players. That means he's an average NBA starter."
Average starter? Look I'm high on Harrison Barnes but just look at his statline from this season - seems like a solid third option to me  16.9/6.6/3.5 on .497/.391/.830 last season along with solid defense in a position that's hard to find quality players in.  As far as Fournier and Gallo goes - Fournier was an expiring so Orlando didn't have any leverage and he might even walk away from Boston if it means he gets overpaid. The only reason OKC got a second back was because they did a S&amp;T for Gallo (who owed them nothing). OKC could've moved Gallo prior to the deadline for more assets.
Harrison Barnes is the epitome of a great teammate. He does a little bit of everything. We overpaid to bring him here. There's no reason to trade him just to trade him. He will be a king unless we get a good offer.
Well they were actually trying to make the play-in last year which is w hy they bought Delon Wright. IIRC the Celtics and [Nuggets](https://www.denverpost.com/2021/03/23/nuggets-harrison-barnes-kings-forward-harrison-barnes-trade-deadline/) wanted Barnes with their TPE and Kings said [no](https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/31110462/nba-trade-deadline-latest-intel-most-likely-deals)
Makes sense and definitely still worth it for you guys. Wiggins over performed this season but Siakam is definitely an upgrade. I feel like he could fill that Harrison Barnes role from years ago. If Klay is healthy then he replaces those Wiggins minutes
"If you want to see it as wasting a roster spot, I’m not gonna argue with that. Plumlee was selected because they preferred someone who had a history with the program, it was not racial. Same reason Harrison Barnes and Derrick White made the team over Bam"
"Yea the thing with Ezeli when he lied to the rest of the players that Ezeli was rooting against them was way out of pocket. And the Harrison Barnes exorcism situation. He was crazy but he was a still a players' coach, since it became a player vs front office situation."
Ask Harrison Barnes
Ah my bad I didn’t see free agent. Closest I can think of is Harrison Barnes
"&gt; Cade's deal is he doesn't do any one thing so well that you immediately go, ""Well, that's gonna be a legit all star.""  He does everything  &gt; pretty good &gt;  --- good shooter, good passer, good ball handler, good locker room guy, good posting up, he's pretty smart, etc. For his size, he's good.  Not great.  He's not elite at anything, or athletically elite, but he's so well rounded that it just makes him a really good player.  This is exactly how he seemed to me.  And that makes me really skeptical of his prospects in the league tbh.  It's how players like Harrison Barnes get overhyped before entering the nba."
"What excites me is having a squad back together that knows how to operate as a unit back out on the floor. Although aged, you can throw Wiggins into the Harrison Barnes roll and you have the old ""Lineup of Death"" group back out on the floor.  It won't look the same, but this is a unit that you can trust to put out there and won't make a lot of mistakes.  Steph and Dray (and a bit of Looney) have been the only solidifying factors on the Warriors for the past two years, so bringing Andre back in is just comforting from that perspective."
Probably Harrison Barnes.
Even more underrated move when the warriors replaced Harrison Barnes with KD. Don’t think anyone else on this sub noticed that besides me
Harrison Barnes also.
"Otherwise no. We got Chandler Parsons, Monta Ellis, DJ the second time, post Achilles Wesley Matthews, Harrison Barnes in the 2010’s. But Dallas seems to be the quintessential “big market, willing to spend” but never gets anything. It’s maddening"
You can always give enough unprotected picks and pick swaps that something like this will work. It's a question of whether it is worth doing(which it is not in Sacramentos case at all IMO).  But like yes if you give Masai all the unprotected picks a bunch of pick swaps and matching salary in the form of like Harrison Barnes and Delon Wright he's not exactly going to hang up the phone.
"21 is by far the worst team.  2 top ten players (dame/durant)  2 top 20 players (tatum/booker)  4 top 30 players (bam/jrue/khris/lavine)  and then there is Draymond, Javale, Grant, and Johnson  for reference 16 still had Lowry/Butler/George/Thompson/Irving/Durant/Draymond/Demar/Cousins as all top 30 players, and most of those are top 20.  And Harrison Barnes Carmelo Anthony and Deandre Jordan are better than Grant/Johnson/McGee."
Yeah that Finals Harrison Barnes
"You could make an argument for Harrison Barnes…   Warriors tanked to get the pick that wound up being HB. If they don’t tank and that pick conveys, an injury-riddled Steph might be a trade asset instead of getting a rookie extension…"
"harrison barnes?? you think that’s the needle changing move? lol  tobias, siakam (can’t see it happening but it’s at least been rumoured) are way better fits and players. barnes is fine, he’s not a second option at all though. i’d rather run it back than trade cj for barnes, as fun as it’d be to watch CJ average 30 in sacramento"
"Trade CJ for Harrison Barnes in a 3-team deal is what I've been advocating for a long time.  You're right at the end of the day that Portland's situation is fucked and they'll never be able to surround Dame with another star, but I still think they can take a whack at making a *competent* team around him."
Kobe tearing his ACL and going down on a non-contact foul call on Harrison Barnes. That’s how much respect the refs had for Kobe.
"To describe Iguodala as a bench player is both technically accurately and completely misleading.  Iguodala came off the bench for balance issues, not because Harrison Barnes was better than he was. Iguodala closed games, and was part of all of the team's best lineups in both the pre-KD and KD eras.   Yes, normally you start your five best guys. Part of why the 15 and 16 Warrior teams was so good is because every single player put their ego aside for the team, and part of that was Iguodala giving up his starting spot to a player everybody knew was worse than he was."
"You can't really say until he wins it, because there's a huge difference in how we talk about them if he wins it while carrying the team like he carried them in the Milwaukee series this year, and winning it while Harden goes nuts and is leading the team, which is an absolute possibility.   I mean, this Nets team is absolutely stacked at this point. If you took KD off of it and replaced him with, I dunno, Harrison Barnes, and everybody gave a shit and was healthy for the full season, how many games do you think they could win? At least 60, and they might be better than the '18 Rockets."
Harrison Barnes
Harrison Barnes?
Harrison Barnes had a very nice year for Golden State when he was selected if I remember correctly.
They left my man Harrison barnes off the team because they knew it would be too OP
Harrison Barnes?
"JaVale McGee, Keldon Johnson, and Jerami Grant join Harrison Barnes as gold medalists"
"JaVale McGee, Keldon Johnson, and Jerami Grant join Harrison Barnes as gold medalists."
"2019 FIBA World Cup team was pretty weak:  Derrick White, Donovan Mitchell, Joe Harris, Marcus Smart, Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Mason Plumlee, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Kemba Walker"
"And Harrison Barnes, oh wait"
"Say you take out lebron and put an average/solid player in his place, maybe Harrison Barnes. How many games does that team win? A starting lineup of Snow/Hughes/Barnes/Gooden/Ilgauskas is a high lottery team. That team sucked ass, and that fact won’t change no matter how often people on r/nba ask."
Lacob needs to call Harrison Barnes and bring him back.
Fans really over small sample size playoff performance.  Playoffs are about match ups.  Sometimes teams will risk letting a #2 or #3 option try to beat them. And sometimes over a smallish stretch of games they will.  We went through this Harrison Barnes rookie year series with the Spurs.  He scored a lot because the Spurs were ok with him scoring from 2 and not Steph or Klay from 3.
"Where’s Harrison Barnes let’s get 73 wins again  At least 37 wins, same thing"
"You're getting a lot of troll responses, but the Olympic 3x3 was really fun to watch. It's difficult because of the qualification requirements, but if USA Basketball wanted to take the men's 3x3 as seriously as they take the women's 3x3 (and I think they should), then it's definitely possible. Ideally, you'd have one taller point guard (Dejounte is a good pick), and then 2 big wings who are good one-on-one defenders (Harrison Barnes, Mikal Bridges, and Kyle Anderson come to mind), and one mobile big as a roll man who can also guard on the perimeter on switches (John Collins definitely works here, as does someone like Mason Plumlee or Aaron Gordon)."
"Of course, and maybe **superstar** isn't the right term. But, you can't deny that Dame hasn't even played next to another **All-Star** since LMA left.  It's not like they have a lot of flexibility to trade any of their contracts either; everybody clamors to trade CJ but he's getting paid a star's salary and is pretty difficult to move.  I'd personally love to see a trade for Harrison Barnes but it's not like the Blazers have a lot of options here."
"&gt; Harrison Barnes still got paid even after choking the hardest I’ve ever seen a man choke.  Lmao that's true. But Dennis is gonna be fine. Won't get as much money as he wanted, but he's still a good player and will likely find a nice deal down the line."
Harrison Barnes still got paid even after choking the hardest I’ve ever seen a man choke. Feel kinda bad for Dennis not gonna lie
How do we get Harrison Barnes back on this team?
Who would have thought that Iggy would have been the Warriors' 2015 Forward that started an anti-plagiarism campaign? I know I had my money on Harrison Barnes.
"Went to one of those team-affiliated signings and met Harrison Barnes/Seth Curry, Barnes was super nice and polite, Seth was kind of an ass  Met Alex Caruso while at A&amp;M, I thought he was a decent player and had size/potential, but this was right before he kinda became A&amp;M’s star. So I asked him for a photo at the Rec and he almost seemed surprised, but he was a good dude and nice and obliged me"
I think a better comparison for Kuminga would be Harrison Barnes with great defense. Moody could fall in between Mikal Bridges and Middleton
"Hard pass if this would include Fox or Haliburton...And probably not Harrison Barnes either. I'm not sure we'd even give up a 1st rounder.     If it's Buddy and Bagley going out with a second rounder etc (might have to be a three team deal) then sure, but none of these ridiculous Simmons deals we keep hearing Philly wants.     Max player on a long term contract that needs the ball in his hands and refuses to learn how to shoot jumpers is not worth anything more than that."
"I agree it’s not the greatest option, but I’m not sure many teams would field a better option for Simmons. He’s just too difficult of a player to build around.   The only other option I’ve thought about was Simmons + a pick or two for De’Aaron Fox + Harrison Barnes. The Kings just drafted another small guard and Simmons would fit well with Haliburton and Buddy Hield."
"I’m imagining it’d be DLo, Naz Reid (good backup center), picks, and maybe Malik Beasley. Then Philly can move the Wolves picks + their own picks for further upgrades.   Could 2-3 wolves picks and someone like Thybulle net you Jeremi Grant or Harrison Barnes? I’m not sure exactly what trade they’d make next, but I think you could do a lot with DLo, Curry, Thybulle, Harris, Embiid, and 10+ draft picks (7 from Philly and at least 3 from T-Wolves).   There’s no single move for Simmons (except Lillard) that makes the 76ers an sure-fire contender. As a result, I think they need to find a couple moves. Plus, I think DLo and Embiid fit really well together."
"The two teams I feel are most likely to make a move are Kings and Warriors.   Sac could offer Buddy Heild (or harrison Barnes?) and Bagley and maybe a pick  Warriors could give up Wiggins Oubre and maybe a couple picks.   Both trades offer the 6ers shooting and wing depth. I'm not sure how much the 6ers would actually want Bagley since they have embiid, might get a 3rd team involved."
"Yes but it's going to be extremely hard to outvalue 7 solid players for $20 million.   For reference here's some guys who are making about $20 million:  Buddy Hield, Malcolm Brogdon, Gary Harris, Danilo Gallinari, Harrison Barnes, Jerami Grant, Julius Randle, FVV, Zach Lavine, Goran Dragic, Clint Capela, Bojan Bogdonovic, Domatas Sabonis, Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe"
CJ in a 3-team trade that gets them Harrison Barnes let me will it into existence.
High: Harrison barnes - people still think hes trash from that finals series  Low: Kyle lowry - always thought he was overrated. Without kawhi his legacy would be just losing to lebron year after year much like derozan
Harrison Barnes 2016 finals
"What you just described isn’t Harrison Barnes lmao, Barnes was actually a damn good shooter for us"
They need to go for a 3-team trade with Harrison Barnes that's the best they can do.
"It's a testament to how good BOTH of those dudes were in the OKC days. The 2014 team that lost in six in the WCF to the Spurs (who blasted the Heat by 20 ppg) had KD, Russ, and injured/hobbled Ibaka, a third-year Reggie Jackson, and then the rest of their playoff rotation was Kendrick Perkins, washed Caron Butler, rookie Steven Adams, Jeremy Lamb, and 39-year-old Derek Fisher. They won 59-games in the West that included Memphis, upstart Golden State, the peak lob city Clippers, and the champion Spurs.   KD and Russ were the only players in the Spurs series to average more than 12 ppg. Fisher was their fifth leading scorer with 5.7 ppg. Perry Jones, Lamb, Butler and Jackson combined to shoot 12/28 for three in the series. Fisher did shoot 8/17 from three, but was horrendous at everything else, including 3/13 from two in the series.  The 2016 Thunder beat the 67-win Spurs in six and then were up 3-1 on the 73-win Warriors before an epic collapse and a Klay Thompson miracle game 6. They lost the series because Klay and Steph combined to shoot 42% from three on over 21 combined attempts her game, and Harrison fuckin' Barnes somehow put in 10/19 from three over the series before turning into dogshit in the finals. While Russ didn't shoot well in the series, he did get to the line roughly nine time per game and shot 82% from there, and put up a statline of 27 / 11 / 7 and 3.7 steals per game. His defense was a key part of flummoxing the Warriors machine. The Thunder shot 32% in the series from three, and KD shot 29%.   They had a better overall roster in 2016 with Adams, Roberson, Waiters and Kanter, but still lacked a consistent supporting cast, had no outside shooting, and didn't have other creators on their roster. They still probably should have won the title.  In 2013, they had the best record in the West and Russ' knee was destroyed in the first playoff game. In 2015, KD hurt his foot and was out most of the season.  So, basically, even after Harden was gone they were in competitive WCF series against excellent teams every season Russ and KD were healthy. I am pretty confident they win a title or two over the next few seasons if KD stayed."
Harrison barnes
"Didn't the Mavs have Seth Curry, Bogut, and 2 other players named Thompson and Green on the roster at one point a few years back?  Oh and Harrison Barnes"
Uh what? How was Curry the biggest disappointment in 2016 when Harrison Barnes exists? Also Curry was definitely the best player on the court in the 2019 finals
Harrison Barnes has been playing PF for a while now.  Put Tobias next to him and one of them is going to get cooked on the perimeter nightly.
"&gt;2016:   Best player: Draymond Green, 17/10/6 on 62% TS   &gt;   &gt;   Disappointment: Stephen Curry, 23/5/4 on 58% TS(not horrible numbers, but most of them put up in the first 4 games)  Harrison Barnes  scored 0 points and 0 assists in game 6 and he played 16 minutes lol."
2016 disappointment was 100% Harrison Barnes. Man shot 35% from the field in the Finals
"The Harrison Barnes 2016 Finals. All he needed to do was play decent in 1 game and he went abysmal in three straight.   If he played well and the Warriors win that Series, I do not believe Kevin Durant ever ends up in Golden State"
Lol Harrison Barnes made the list though
"If the Raptors trade away Pascal for that return it would be a massive blow. Also, RoCo has kind of plummeted off a cliff, so I think trading for him and only him is a bad move the bulls too. If the Raptors want to trade Pascal, it might be more worth it to go for Harrison Barnes and a kings first. Coby White, Lauri, and Anfernee are all far less valuable than Harrison Barnes, and the Kings are a desperate franchise. As long as Luke Walton is their coach, there’s a for sale sign on any talent they want to mishandle"
They really can't make any moves. Their assets aren't great. The big salary they can move out is CJ but he's not getting a lot of demand.  I've argued for a long time that the Blazers need to concoct a 3-team trade that sends out CJ and gets Harrison Barnes in return. The Blazers do not have assets to get another star next to CJ but they can try to build a *competent* team around Dame by getting them a solid 2-way wing (which they haven't had since Batum dipped from Portland).  Dame / Powell / Barnes / RoCo / Nurk is a very solid team on paper. I doubt it'll get them past the second round but if keeping Dame happy means retooling the roster to the best of their abilities then I think the FO is obligated to do it.
"&gt;Caruso is not a willing shooter he has averaged 2.1 three point attempts in the last 3 years.  He's averaged 20 minutes per game the last three years. He took 5.5 attempts per 100 possessions, which is below average but fine, and in-line with the volume of guys like Tobias Harris, Harrison Barnes, and Chris Paul. He was also more comfortable this year taking shots even when he wasn't wide open, which is important.  &gt;Of course Curry is going to be heavily guarded from three and he’s the best shooter ever so naturally he will make more difficult shots than 37 year old Carmelo Anthony.  This is a total non-sequitur. Nobody disagrees with this.  &gt;It’s not Carmelo’s fault that he has the luxury of more open shots.  My point is that if your best shooter is just above average and can't even play more than 20 minutes per game, and if your second best shooter is LeBron (while sharing the floor with AD and Westbrook), that team is a very very bad shooting team. Not sure how anyone can disagree with this.  &gt;Why are you downplaying other peoples percentages who happen to get more open threes?  Because if you're open, you should have higher percentages. That's the entire point. 38% from three is good on its face. However, league average when you're wide open is 39-40%. If you only take wide open shots but you shoot worse than 39%, that makes you below league average.   If you have a team of 37% shooters, but they only take wide open shots, that would be a team of terrible shooters. A team of shooters that shoots 35% on a mix of attempts on higher volume is more valuable and are better shooters than the first group."
Harrison Barnes literally signed a max contract with the Mavs that summer.
"Getting PTSD here but Harrison Barnes back in 2016, declined an extension and built a house with all those fucking bricks in the finals"
"Honestly even if a team looked better on paper, like teaming up with Kawhi and PG or something, I just don't see why he would leave Draymond and Klay who still have plenty left in the tank (well not sure about Klay but hoping so). They were in the trenches together, everyone knows their role, they have Wigs playing the Harrison Barnes role, his legacy and hardware are already written in stone. Like, don't leave a good thing you know?"
"The 73-9 warriors had a 2x MVP (Steph). They won the championship in 2015, and they would’ve won again in 2016 if draymond didn’t punch Lebron in the nuts. They were loaded with experience… besides Steph, Klay, Draymond, they had Iggy, Livingston, Barbosa, Bogut, and Mo Speights. Then they essentially swapped Harrison Barnes for KD… there is no comparison, and if you think there is you’re smoking rocks dude"
I've been pretty critical of Ainge over the past few years but there wasn't a lot that they could've done with the TPE.  I think they could've swung harder on Harrison Barnes but at the end of the day the mistakes that Ainge made go back a lot farther than that TPE.
Put some respek on Former Cavs champion Harrison Barnes.
Think of harrison Barnes role during those championship run and you got the perfect guy if he's healthy
Harrison Barnes  Go toe Spotrac and look at this contract
"Yeah usually in trades like that one team wins the short term and one team wins the long term. The Warriors won BOTH ends of that trade, by keeping their first round pick (the long term, ended up being Harrison Barnes) and getting the better player (Bogut) plus on top of that they freed up minutes for Steph."
"Because Warrior's management also did Curry a solid by giving him a chance.  Many people seem to forget that Curry was really injury prone during his rookie contract.  Warriors re-signed him to the 4 year 44m which obviously is a steal now, but back then there were real question marks as to whether Curry would end up being the next Grant Hill.    It ended up working out great for the team.  Warriors drafted Draymond and Harrison Barnes and with the salary flexibility signed a bunch of great pieces such as Iggy, Livingston, Speights.    Giannis had already had a max contract prior to the one he just signed last summer where he had already won 2 MVPs and a DPOY and at this point it was up to the team to put pieces around him to contend."
"Definitely not true, so many players got paid even more after shitting the bed in the playoffs  I can literally give you countless examples  Harden shit the level in the finals, he got a max, Harrison Barnes played like a literal cripple in the finals, rejected a 72m contract before that season, got a 90m contract after    There's so many, playoffs are a small sample size, not a single team is going to judge a player based on 5 games when u have a 80 game sample size"
Did not know Harrison Barnes could get up like that
I will never not upvote Harrison Barnes content.
Harrison Barnes was amazing in this comeback
They won’t talk about FMVP Andre Iguodola? You don’t think Harrison Barnes was a fantastic 5th option? That Bogut wasn’t still a very sound defensive big man? I mean c’mon that team was phenomenal.
"Bagley will be a 25 ppg 12 rebound pg guy by the time hes 25 AT THE LATEST The kings fucked up bagley FROM DAY 1 by trying to go for the 8th friggin seed instead of just giving fox and bagley 35 minutes a game to develop and even more importantly develop CHEMISTRY Fox should be able to hit bagley with a rim runni g alley opp in his sleep by now but i can literally count on one hand how many alley oops fox threw to bagley out of the pick n roll last year Fox is atrocious at running the pick and roll and he ABSOLUTELY WOULDN'T BE IF BAGLEY HAD BEEN RIM ROLLING FOR 35 MINUTES A GAME FROM DAY 1 Instead, somehow joerger convinced himself bagley was good enough to close out games in the 4th quarter AS THE #1 OPTION ON OFFENSE But somehow wasnt good enough to start This is why joerger was fired and hasnt been re hired since Divac went out and got harrison barnes Bagleys rookie season to play the 3 leaving the starting 4 spot WIDE OPEN FOR BAGLEY What does this absolutely retard joerger do? He starts bogi at the fuking 3!!! And bogi gets injured within the first week Again, it wouldn't be SO WEIRD if joerger didn't have bagley CLOSING GAMES PLAYING THE 4TH QUARTER FROM THE 7 MINUTE MARK UNTIL THE END OF THE GAME And again, it wouldnt be SO WEIRD if the kings offense didn't COMPLETELY RUN THROUGH BAGLEY IN THE MID-POST FROM ABOUT THE 7 MINUTE MARK IN THE 4TH QUARTER UNTIL THE END OF THE GAME If i were bagley, it would ABSOLUTELY PISS ME OFF, THE SACRAMENTO FUKING KINGS GET THE SECOND PICK IN THE DRAFT AND DONT START HIM WHEN HES PUTTING UP 22 AND 11 PER 36 ON INCREDIBLE EFFICIENCY FOR A ROOKIE? Even jayson fuking tatum started for the Celtics as a rookie being the #3 pick in the draft and the Celtics were LOADED The kings hadnt made the playoffs in 15 god damn years when bagley got there FOR VERY GOOD REASON IM SURE HE THOUGHT HED BE STARTING AT THE 4 AND GETTING UP 20ISH SHOTS PER GAME DAY 1!!! Instead joerger wanted to make a ""push"" lol for that coveted 8th seed to be swept into oblivion You cant BOTH develop franchise players AND compete for the playoffs The kings havent learned this is almost 20 years of repeating the same dumbass mistake I ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEE YOU that bagley will either be gone this season as hed made it abundantly clear hes miserable in Sacramento, or next season When he leaves, hes either going to get traded to a team that plans on using him thenway hes supposed to play... Or bagley is going to sign with a team where he knows hel FINALLY get the chance to be the focal point of the offense and put up 20+ shots a game I love how the kings fan base has already psychotically convinced themselves that bagley will always be a terrible defender lol IT TAKES 4 FULL SEASONS... 4!!! FULL SEASONS, Bagley has played 115 games, the equivalent of about a season and a half, but anyway it takes 4 FULL SEASONS before 99% of 1 and done bigs are no longer a liability on defense I expect bagley to be a VERY VERSATILE DEFENDER Able to start at the 4 and stay with 90% of the players hes assigned to defend, not to mention at 6 11 with a 7 1 wingspan someone that can SERIOUSLY BOTHER 3pt corner shots, which will be what the majority of 4s in next years nba will be doing next season... Standing in the corner and shooting 3s I think bagley speed and vertical will bother those just a lot more than ur average 6 6/6 7 wing defender As far as bagleys ability to play center on defense First of all more and more teams are using a 5 out offense where the center niether sets a pick or rolls to the rim Again 90% of bagleys defense will be closeouts at the 3pt line In the cases where teams do run the pick n roll and bagley is playing center, its going to take some reps for bagley to get a good feel and timing to his pick n roll defense Probably 1 FULL SEASON WITH AT LEAST 75 GAMES PLAYED But with bagleys athleticism once he gets the feel for the defensive side of the ball hel be able to.play 35+ minutes a game If he plays 35 minutes a game hes going to.put up.allstar caliber numbers Oh, one thing u forgot about when talking about necessary skills for todays bigs... Offensive rebounds!!! And bagley is one of the best offensive rebounders in the nba, and possibly the best in the league at scoring on offensive rebounds do to his uncanny ability to get off the ground 2 or 3 times before most players even la d after jumping once And 2. Taking those small ball guys down on the post I can count on one hand the guys in the nba id rather have with the ball in the post than bagley With so many teams going small in todays nba The only way to make them pay is by 1. Dominating them on the boards"
Seth Curry and Harrison Barnes would look pretty good on the Mavs right now...
"Next years Heat Roster will include:  Lowry, DeRozan, Danny Green, Nic Batum, Rudy Gay, Harrison Barnes, and Kelly Oubre."
I'd be open to trading Turner for Harrison Barnes or PJ Washington and that's about it.
It's not a glamorous trade but they should seriously look into a 3-team trade for Harrison Barnes.  The Blazers don't have the assets to add another star next to Dame. I think the best thing they can do is try to field a *competent* roster next him.   Dame / Powell / Barnes / RoCo / Nurk
"I just feel bad for Boston. They generated that huge TPE from the Hayward trade and don't have a lot to show for it.  They wasted two seconds on Fournier (granted, they're just seconds). But then they dumped Kemba along with a first to get Horford and enough cap space to re-sign Fournier only to see Fournier dip in search of an overpay.  The other portion of it went to Josh Richardson who's just been meh the past few seasons.  I was a huge proponent of Sacramento finally retooling and trading Harrison Barnes but that didn't happen."
That's him saving his ass. Harrison Barnes posted an  image in his IG saying his farewell to Bogdan and Bogdan replied thank you.  I highly doubt he didn't signed anything.
I feel like they could actually use Harrison Barnes over KP rn. Barnes was solid for them and would be a huge upgrade defensively over KP
They got Chandler Parsons and Harrison Barnes what more do you need my guy
They basically wanted to do with Wiseman what they did with Harrison Barnes and Iggy. They wanted to hide the worse player amongst the starters.
Harrison Barnes?
"I'm genuinely curious what ""win now"" trades Andy Liu and others are talking about when they complain about Meyers refusing to trade Wiseman, Wiggins, Kuminga and Moody.  I'd love to trade them for Dame, Beal, PG, Jaylen Brown or some other superstar and I'm sure Meyers would love to also... The problem is, those teams/players aren't available at the moment and it takes two parties to conduct a trade.  Wiggins, Wiseman, 7 &amp; 14th for Siakam?  Seem too high a price for perhaps a marginal upgrade.  Maybe Wiggins, Kuminga, Moody and Paschal for Harrison Barnes and Hield?  Not sure if Kings would do this without more from the warriors, but I think it does improve the warriors, just not sure how much."
"Yeah by this logic you could say ""replace KD with 2016 Finals Harrison Barnes and the Warriors lose every year, therefore the Warriors needed KD to win another one""  It doesn't work that way lol"
"The market dictates what players will ask.  2020-21 Salaries for these wings/shooters:  * Tim Hardaway Jr. - $18,975,000	 * Gary Harris - $19,160,714 * Malcolm Brogdon - $20,700,000 * Buddy Hield - $24,431,818 * Otto Porter - $28,489,239 * Harrison Barnes - $22,215,909 * Danilo Gallinari - $19,500,000 * Bogdan Bogdanović - $18,000,000  Can you blame his agent?"
"And players with positional size open a lot of doors, lineup-wise.   Everybody goes on about smallball all the time, but what made the Warriors smallball lineups so great is that they were *big* small-ball lineups.   Durant, obviously, but also Harrison Barnes isn't giving anything up size-wise playing at the 4. Livingston and Klay could both play up a position without sacrificing size. When you have a guy with the skillset of a 1 and the size of a 2 or 3, you have a cheat code. When you have a guy with the skillset of a 2, but the size of a 4, you have a cheat code.   It even lets you find minutes for those sorts of players you can find cheap: short guys who can't play the 1. You get a big 1, you can play an undersized 2.  You have a small 1 and play him next to a small 2, they often get picked on."
They should’ve kept Harrison Barnes. He was part of the brand. Wasn’t worth it for 2 soulless titles no one feels good about w KD
"I’d think they could get more value from the 76ers. I think Simmons is terrible, but I still think that’s an upgrade over Kuzma. Harrell would play behind their billion playable bigs? Which also doesn’t leave room for Harrison Barnes. I’ve heard they wanna trade him, but still."
"Yes, because it solved a couple problems at once:   1) We need size at the wing, and Kuz brings that. He fits the timeline for the team, and can add some wing scoring. Harrison Barnes had to do that all by himself last year, and Kuz can help take some of that pressure off of him. He’s also cheaper than Buddy, so it frees up some money to retain Holmes, which brings me to point 2 —  2) we’re probably losing Holmes. Love him to death, but he played himself into a payday, and he should go get paid while he has a chance. Trez and Holmes are players cut from the same cloth, and would be a pretty seamless transition if Holmes indeed leaves. His contract also expires at the end of the year, giving us more flexibility.   3) pick 22 would’ve been real nice."
"Kuzma would be reuniting with Luke Walton when he had his best season and be getting a fresh start as a 6th man, or to take Harrison Barnes place if they move him for assets to a contender.   Harrell could potentially play C for the Kings if Holmes leaves and he has a connection to their developmental coach Rico Hines. They also want to move Buddy so they can develop Haliburton as well.   For the Wizards they now have a hole at PG so they are looking to fill it with somebody, Dennis while underperformed for the Lakers definitely still has value in the league, and he’s going to get a big deal this summer whether or not Reddit thinks he deserves it. KCP is a solid 3-D championship player who’s also Bradley Beals best friend.   There’s a lot of moving parts and it might not happen but to say Laker fans are delusional just shows you’re just hating before you even know all the facts"
ah yes forgot about that MAXIMUM CALIBER USA basketball team in 2019 which lost b2b games vs france and serbia. legendary 7th place team featuring:  mason plumlee  myles turner  harrison barnes  derrick white  joe harris  some real talent there. and yet they're all still better than kevin love lmfao.  BTW kevin love withdrew from that team.
As good as Scottie Pippen and Harrison Barnes combined
Also picked Harrison Barnes at 7 which wasn't that bad
I hope he turns into a harrison barnes lol
"Star: Paul George, Bust: Stanley Johnson  I think Kuminga will end up somewhere in between, maybe Harrison Barnes?"
I’m not a basketball expert or anything but even I know this. A huge part of the reason why the 2016 Cavs made their finals comeback was the complete disappearance of Harrison Barnes from behind the line. They were able to focus their defense on Bogut and the other shooters thanks to having complete confidence that Barnes was not going to make 3s at a high enough rate to actually punish them for leaving him wide open
"Raps hope to pick Scottie Pippen, not get the Harrison Barnes."
No way that Harrison Barnes is untouchable lol
why the hell is harrison barnes completely untouchable when trading for a DPOY level player lmao  i get we’re all low on simmons right now but jesus lol
Is it? If Ant and D lo are off the table I’d rather have haliburton or Davion + Harrison Barnes than Malik Beasley and okogie
"Not really, Fox, Halliburton and Harrison Barnes are off limits."
"Yes Harrison Barnes missed like 400 three point attempts in a row in that epic Cavs comback final series, but at least he kept shooting it. Also he wasn't spending his summers banging IG thots and telling his team that he is doing just fine getting coached by his own brother!"
"You can get a Kuzma contract and a ring or an Ingram contract and no ring. I rather have the racks, opportunity, and a team who had a more extended history than what you did for me in the playoffs.    I think Simmons is getting a raw deal. Harrison Barnes still got a big-money contract after stinking it up on golden state the last few series.   Lonzo ball was also a scrub because he couldn't shot. Boy can shoot now.   What caused this was Doc’s insecurities of not being a good coach and leaving the podium early.   That being said, that will be a fun team to watch in Minnesota!"
i would rather have wiggins than simmons as wiggins has shown that on a  team where he doesnt have to be the guy he can be a better harrison barnes level player and still occasionally go off. Especially now that simmons is demanding a trade i just dont see any potential haul from anyone rational.
The game where Harrison Barnes drained a corner three to ice the game yeah that one hurt
"Contract year Bagley, Buddy Heild, Harrison Barnes, and a handful of Diamond Almonds for Ben?"
"The Kings actually having three point guards means you could build a trade that would actually help the sixers. Something like Haliburton, Harrison Barnes, picks?  If I'm the Sixers I'd demand Fox, which might be a lot of fun for both teams. I'd rather see Fox become successful in Sactown, but the salary would match, he's better than the young guys and would help Philly immediately, and it lets you turn the keys over to the kids."
"Honestly not really. Sure the Kings are in California but they don't have a lot that Philly would be interested in aside from Harrison Barnes.  For all of Ben's faults, the two things he's able to provide are wing defense and ball-handling (the fact that he's a single player that can do *both* of those things makes him special). In most scenarios, Philly would need to get two players back to fill that void. It's why I think the best theoretical return for Philly would be OG and FVV from Toronto.  Sacramento can provide that on a much weaker scale. It'd be Barnes and one of either Haliburton or Mitchell. I don't see Philly being 100% interested in either of those guards since they're so young.   Buddy Hield only makes sense if the 76ers were actually keeping Simmons. Can you imagine how awful a Seth Curry and Buddy Hield backcourt would be? Sure they can shoot great, but neither of those guys are actual playmakers."
Would sixers take Halliburton and Harrison Barnes for Simmons
"I think *ideally* for Philly, and **this is a longshot to happen** is a trade to the Raptors for OG and FVV.  Ben has a lot of faults, but the two things he can provide are ball-handling and defending the opponent's best player. Having both of those duties for 1 player is huge and to realistic replace those duties it'd require 2 players back. FVV and OG provide that.  A shittier version of that would be one of Davion Mitchell/Tyrese Haliburton and Harrison Barnes.   That's always been my issue with a CJ trade - Philly is going to kick and scream to get Robert Covington back too because if Ben's gone - who's going to defend the 3 on the 76ers? Old-ass Danny Green?"
"That's a pretty awful return for Simmons  I've been looking into Sac/Philly trades but it's kind of tricky matching that 30M that you need in salary. I imagine that they'd have to get Harrison Barnes back.  I kind of like the idea of Harrison Barnes, Davion Mitchell and TT."
"I understand that but you're aware no one is about to study the last whatever 120 games for both guys to understand who's a better off ball defender.  Also that off ball &gt; on ball is skewed.  The defensive impact Garnett and Hakeem wasn't just 'off ball defense' it was phenomenal rim protection, which Harrison Barnes is not doing.  Most good off ball defenders do very little other than not make mistakes.   Maybe great rim protection &gt; great on ball defenders."
"I don’t think anyone disagrees. He didn’t live up to the hype, but he’s serviceable. He was straight up BAD relative to his max contract, but in a vacuum- yeah. He’s one of the best basketball players that has ever lived, and is a solid player among the best there are.  You make the millions, you deal with the criticism. It is what it is. If people weren’t talking shit and so angry/passionate, he wouldn’t be a generational millionaire. It’s why they play and it’s why we watch.   Good thing for him is that there is no more “potential” talk. He may make less money next contract,  it he’ll still be filthy rich lol. And get to be in that Harrison Barnes role where no one complains about you anymore"
"The Pelicans apparently offered Hardaway Jr. $90 million, and he still stayed with the Mavs for $72 million. $90 mil was an overpay and they still couldn’t lure a free agent that’s not even an all-star. I feel like the Mavs have trouble with free agents, but the Pelicans have it even worse. We can at least get solid starters like Harrison Barnes and Wes Mathews when we overpay, but the Pelicans can’t even do that"
Probably not but its not impossible Harrison Barnes has a ring.
"He's comparable on-court to Harrison Barnes, but Barnes makes like 10M/year less than Wiggins does."
"His defense improved a bit last year, but I was responding to your comment about his offensive efficiency.  &gt; At his very best, he's a consistent 18 ppg, a good three point shooter  He's almost certainly not a good 3P shooter. He's at 34% for his career and was at 34% for the Warriors in 2020.  &gt;It's not like Wiggins is a terrible passer either. It's not his strength but he can do it decently enough within the system.  He averaged less than 1 pass made per minute last year. Even Wiseman was better than that. The only other guys on the team to average less than 1 pass per minute were Oubre and Mulder. That's terrible for a motion offense, especially for a guy who's not an efficient scorer.  &gt;He's basically in the Harrison Barnes role, and he's doing it better than HB.  He shoots a lot more than Barnes while scoring less efficiently. That's not necessarily a good thing."
"At his very best, he's a consistent 18 ppg, a good three point shooter (something we typically lack outside of Steph and Klay), our second best defender who also doesn't foul much. It's not like Wiggins is a terrible passer either. It's not his strength but he can do it decently enough within the system. He's basically in the Harrison Barnes role, and he's doing it better than HB. Our offense is always gonna be a lot worse without Curry on the floor because the whole entire system runs through him. What we really need is a good backup point guard. It's been tough since we lost Iggy and Shaun."
"It was never much about his stats, he a starter in the NBA for sure.   It is always about the money. He won't live up to the max deal he got. On his next contract his perception will change even more. Moving from $33M to around $20M or so. Around guys like Buddy Hield, Tim Hardaway Jr, Harrison Barnes, etc."
Ahh... But you're forgetting Marvin Bagley and Harrison Barnes. No one can stop them
"I always say we're a 3 away from being respectable. Harrison Barnes is ol reliable, but that upper echelon of SF is tough to find"
"Blazers aren’t going to trade for a 24 year old with Dame being almost 32 wanting to win now. They’re going to look for something that has a faster turnout (like a Beal or Towns)  Why would Sixers trade for Ingram? They have Tobias Harris who is practically the same player as Ingram, the two would just be butting heads on offense and be redundant. Sixers want and need a point guard, preferably a scoring one, and that’s why they’re pursuing Dame. They’re not going after a wing. They’ll get DLo out of Minnesota before they go for Ingram.  Warriors maybe, but I can see them being in a similar situation as Portland and going after Siakam since he’s more of a win-now wing that can fit with Steph, Klay and Draymond. One can argue that it would probably be the same situation as they have with Wiggins if they got Ingram.  Sacramento could offer a Buddy Hield + Harrison Barnes type package but i don’t think that is better than a Dillion Brooks and Kyle Anderson package. Dillion Brooks as a player &gt; Buddy + Kyle Anderson at this point is a better player than Barnes is. Also, Anderson and Brooks’s contracts are a lot more team friendly and they’re both younger."
He probably means that he met Harrison Barnes twice and got his picture taken one of those times.
I used to message with Harrison Barnes on Twitter when he was on the Warriors. Seemed like a really good dude
Are you stalking Harrison Barnes?
I ran into Harrison Barnes twice in three days and he stopped what he was doing (at the Art Institute of Chicago and O’Hare Airport) to take a pic. Stand up guy!
"Everything before drafting Harrison Barnes.   I know what you’re thinking - We Believe was the rejuvenation. Wrong. It was nothing but hope followed by a complete overhaul within 2 years.   And that only made it a reminder. Of exactly how the TMC era began and ended :(. If you’re a bandwagon warriors fan, fuck you."
"I mean, tbh nobody really knew how good we were. I remember at the time being upset mark was leaving even though I did question a lot of his decisions (mostly throwing away any chance we had against San Antonio in 2013 by relying on Harrison Barnes isos in crunch time) but after watching our first few games under Kerr I ate my words. The difference was night and day and I never looked back. Mark was lucky the majority of guys in his locker room were into/indifferent to his religious shit. Andrew Bogut has spoken about it several times and Mark did not enjoy Bogut’s opposition and unwillingness to participate in his team prayers and chapel meetings and made sure Bogut knew he didn’t appreciate it."
my favorite was grant williams + carsen edwards + 2nd for harrison barnes
"OP referencing Scottie Pippen who shot 6/18 for 17 points, including 0/5 from 3, and 5/9 from the line is the most liberal definition of ""bailing out"" a team mate I've ever seen.  I guess Harrison Barnes bailed out Curry in the finals as well."
"KD &gt; CJ obviously  Warriors with KD &gt; warriors with CJ obviously  they'd still win a ring with either one. both are better than harrison barnes.   blazers this year had a better roster than the 2012 thunder? Stop trolling cmon. That's a laughable take.  even after harden left, OKC still had kd/russ/ibaka. That's 2 all-nba players and all-defensive 1st team player. Blazers are not better than that lol.   Not to mention reggie jackson in the 2014 playoffs was huge for okc and bailed kd/russ out many times. OKC almost went down 1-3 vs memphis in round 1 if it weren't for a 30 pt game by reggie jackson."
"Cj is way better than harrison barnes lol, so yea they would win with him  &gt; KD as a 22 year old on OKC still went further than the Blazers ever did so he told no lies  OKC was stacked, and KD is way better than CJ... idk who you're arguing with on that lol"
"Only the best? Hasn’t Tyreke Evans hit a buzzer beater? Bjelica? Harrison Barnes? Why I am naming Kings players I don’t know. I don’t think it takes a superstar to hit a buzzer beater, even in game 7. Now it does take a superstar to do it consistently. Ray Allen didn’t improve all time with that shot, he was already considered one of the best shooters but he’s passed now by Curry and Klay who’ve never had a Finals shot like that"
They bring back Harrison Barnes brick ass and lose some more
"Alternatively, if Harrison Barnes shooting doesn’t turn into dogshit that series, they never feel the need to go recruiting KD at all"
"I think the Barnes being traded mid-game thing was a bit exaggerated because they told him he would probably be traded and he wanted to play anyway.   You're right though. It's not like we're trading loyal guys like Tyson and Barnes for a guarantee of another star, we traded them for a very unlikely possibility of getting a star.   On a side note: shoutout to Harrison Barnes for doing so much for Dallas. Last I heard, he's still donating to Dallas based organizations. He's a very good person."
"Durant, PG, Harrison Barnes"
Except Harrison Barnes can shoot.
I would like to imagine Harrison Barnes is more desirable.
"The kings are the odds on favorite to land him. Probably for some sort of combination of Buddy Hield, Harrison Barnes, Bagley and a bunch of picks."
"Also, if you rearrange the letters in Harrison Barnes, you can get ""hao ar Ben sirrons"" and if you threw a question mark at the end of that your comment might still make sense in the flow of conversation"
This is playoff Harrison Barnes we’re talking about (this is also a joke)
Simmons on GSW would basically be a better version of playoff Harrison Barnes
rudy gay. harrison barnes. jayson tatum
"We would've been stuck with a Mamba or Carter then. And we ain't winning shit with a nucleus with either of those two with Dennis smith and Harrison Barnes. Probably would have gotten a top pick the next season and had a chance RJ Barrett, Ja, or Zion"
"I’m so frustrated. We bitch about not getting free agents but we have three guys who loved playing here that we kind of screwed, or let go of twice, Tyson, Harrison, and Seth are all quality players. We got rid of Seth twice, and Tyson, and traded Barnes mid game. HB liked being here and was great for the community and would be a perfect 3/4 guy fitting around Luka, KP and THJ, and we got THJ and KP’s bird rights in the trade, so we would’ve just not gotten Delon.  Oh no…"
Harrison Barnes as the first one
"I can’t stop thinking about that Harrison Barnes trade. With the way THJ changed his game, no reason Barnes couldn’t have been a secondary scorer and defender  A lineup of Luka/THJ/DFS/HB/KP is actually really nice. Damn"
They would just be living in the Harrison Barnes/Dennis smith era. Which is the same thing basically.
I think Terrance Ross and Harrison Barnes should be in that conversation too. I remember Barnes had this super cheesy dunk animation one year that I swear would happen more often than not driving to the rim with him
"Warriors have:  PG: D'Angelo Russell  SG: Alec Burks  SF: Harrison Barnes  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Chris Boucher  Honestly, better than I thought. That's a playoff team"
"Harrison Barnes?   Fate of the universe on the line, Martian pointing dead beam at Earth.."
"Dude, Harrison Barnes instead of Igoudala, hwhat? Should’ve been the Hamptons 5: Steph, Klay, Iggy, KD &amp; Draymond"
Whatever Harrison Barnes did in the finals
Game 6 Harrison Barnes
I think in a few different team subs there's a massive case of gatekeeping which sucks if people are looking for a legit opinion.   I'm beyond the point of giving a fuck though - just have a well-written post and that generally leads to solid discourse.  Shoutout to r/ripcity for making me feel welcome on a Harrison Barnes thread I made last week
Reminded me of Harrison Barnes in the 2016 finals. Getting good looks that they hit all season and just couldn’t sink them
"It's really hard to say because the drama in Golden State early on is a big factor.   Harrison Barnes was really one of the key victims in the Mark Jackson debacle and there was a lot of talk about missed potential as a result.   Plus the way he scapegoated and ostracised Festus Ezeli who was also in the same 2012 draft class as Barnes and Middleton.  Draymond thrived out of that 2012 class, but there's no guarantee Middleton would have.   Is Middleton the same player after being underutilized, overlooked, accused of being a devil and accused of wanting the team to lose games where he sits?"
"Maybe, we definitely win if we have a Harrison Barnes type player to replace his production."
"We’re not considering it. Any discussion with the 76ers for Ben Simmons doesn’t include Halliburton, Fox, or Harrison Barnes because we’re not looking to get draft capital, we already have it.   If a deal does go through it’s like be a 3 team deal, where Hield + Bagley going to 76ers, along with a point guard from the 3rd team and couple of picks from the Kings going to the 3rd team."
Harrison Barnes. DeMar DeRozan. Bobby Portis. PJ Tucker. Eric Gordon. Rondo. Honestly Klay Thompson. Draymond. Morant. Kevin Huerter. Cameron Payne.
Harrison Barnes
"Kevin Love was nowhere close to being the league's worst defender. He was specifically bad at the 1 thing that GSW was able to exploit, which is forcing bigs to guard in space. In every other area of defense, he was below average but not worst in the league below average. Unless you're going to argue that RJ was an average defender vs. Steph and Klay your argument makes no sense.  Most of the time RJ got Harrison Barnes duty and nobody was really guarding him anyway."
Game 6 Harrison Barnes
"It should factor in, but context matters. A player not liking Sac is a major risk. But if it’s Harrison Barnes on the table for a guy like Ben, and we’re saying no because Harrison likes it here, that’s one thing. The fact that Fox had a slow start last year and still averaged 25.2 ppg and 7.2 dimes? And that he still has significant room to improve his free throw and 3pt shooting on top of that, and has shown that he improves his game every season? Even if Simmons’ ceiling is hypothetically higher because of his size, Fox is a much safer bet at having a top tier player that is motivated to contribute here"
"you’re totally right about the defensive impact, and the second paragraph summarizes it perfectly, KD is so fun to watch but he was the most overkill harrison barnes replacement ever lool"
"matt barnes? or harrison barnes? kd left okc when harrison left the warriors, pretty sure this article is quoting matt"
Sixers would want Fox kings ultimately wouldn’t give him up hence no deal will happen  Thankfully for sixers fans Morey isn’t stupid enough to give up Simmons for Buddy hield and Harrison Barnes or something
Still waiting for the Sixers to trade Ben Simmons to the Kings. Ben Simmons for Buddy Hield &amp; Harrison Barnes.
I think in a weird way this clip shows why getting KD made the Warriors so stacked lol  If KD was on the team here instead of Harrison Barnes(who incidentally got boxed out hard on this play lol) Curry just passes out of the pressure
"Hey that Warriors team would have been such a great fit for Love, having Klay and Iggy on perimeter with Draymond and Bought (actually very good defensive anchor at the time) backing him up, that's about the most supportive possible real line up you could give him D wise- and offensively he would have absolutely thrived with that squad. True having him might have slowed Draymond ascension, but I still think it would have happened based on the need to use him for D.  Really wish we could've seen that squad.   I mean Wolves have made so many bad moves over the years, that had to be the one time they stuck to their guns? Wtf. Feels like David Lee and Harrison Barnes should have go it done for a Love trade..."
"He'd be more like an average guy and he'd shoot a bunch more threes, probably would end up akin to Harrison Barnes, perhaps with better defense."
"It was a big 3 for the Cavs. LeBron, Kyrie, and Harrison Barnes"
"I wouldn't be talking about stuff I knew nothing about. Saying I don't is an insult and I'm not gonna respond to that. I actually agree with your Siakam estimate so me never seeing him play ( according to you) is not making a difference here.  The problem seems to be you underrating Wiggins as he is at least worth 20 million a year. Gordon Hayward got 30, Rozier got almost 25, Harrison Barnes got 21.5. He's as or more valuable then all those guys"
"Unfortunately for the Blazers, Brogdon is a bit small for the 3. We've played 3-guard lineups before but that's mostly been due to injury.  3's like TJ Warren are super hard to come by and I imagine we're going to do what we can to try to keep him.   I've been a big fan of trying to get Harrison Barnes to Portland for a while, but that would require a 3-team trade with another team sending out some draft compensation that would entice Sacramento."
"Kd has zero rings without the Warriors. Warriors have one without him, possibly more  They couldve added Paul George, they couldve added Oladipo, they couldve added anybody thats better than Harrison Barnes and they wouldve had a chance at a second ring. KD was overkill on that front.  Kd leaving to join the team that spanked him in 2016 is not doing anyone a favor. Thats like saying if Giannis goes and joins the warriors and they win rings together, the Warriors owe everything to Giannis. Nah buddy its a two way street and a superstar shouldnt be stacking up like that in the first place"
"Buddy Hield, Tyrese Haliburton, Harrison Barnes and Richaun Holmes is on par with Grayson Allen, Dillon Brooks, Jonas Valanciunus and Kyle Anderson"
Yup. The fact that the best regular season team of all time replaced Harrison Barnes with Kevin Durant is just absurd.
What’s the range of flow when you got in and how long do you have to hold it? What’s your favorite TopShot Moment and when will you join the Nine Lives Lounge? (Harrison Barnes and Tyrese Halliburton already joined..)
I love jumping into these types of threads. He also thought a demon was causing Harrison Barnes to shoot poorly.
I would also lose my sense of humour after getting cooked by Harrison Barnes on opening night.
"lmfao.  To be fair he really developed their defensive identity during his tenure, they were like a top 5 defense while he was there (which continued under Kerr).  But he had all those offensive weapons (including David Lee) and the offense was like 13th because he'd keep giving Harrison Barnes freaking mismatch ISOs or some shit like lmaooooo come on bro"
"We didn't draft him to score. We already got Harrison ""Steph Curry"" Barnes for that."
Harrison Barnes just edged him out by 2 points for me.

"Well, that's NBA Champions Harrison Barnes for you"
"Lamelo, Anthony Edwards, Evan Fornier, harrison barnes, bjelica"
He was talking about Harrison Barnes you brick. Kings guy was just agreeing sarcastically. I’ll fight you all. BLAZERS GOING TO FTHE FINALLLLSSSSSS
"I think the Kings will not make the playoffs. Midseason or before the trade deadline, Ben Simmons will be traded for either Harrison Barnes and Buddy Hield + draft pick. You heard it first."
Bruh we are terrible defensively. We were second to last in 2021. Everyone scores a lot on us. This isn't unique to Jokic. *Harrison Barnes* had 36 against us tonight. Our whole thing has been just trying to outscore our opponent.
"What trades work between Philly and Sactown, that includes Ben Simmons and Harrison Barnes?"
I told yall Harrison Barnes was a superstar.   ^Actually ^^^I ^^^^didn't
"Harrison ""The consummate professional"" Barnes"
"At this pace, Harrison Barnes will average 36PPG for the season"
Can't believe we let Harrison Barnes go in order to sign Kevin Durant
"Harrison ""Solid"" Barnes."
Looks like we still can’t hold big leads  Also never trade Harrison Barnes
harrison barnes = steph curry?
"I mean they are, but it’s signed at the percentage the cap was then. Which is what allowed KD to sign with the warriors was the cap jumped up giving the warriors close to max room and they dumped Harrison barnes cap hold to sign KD. It gives the team more cap room but those under contract don’t see an increase in their salary unless they are signing a new deal then."
What if instead of Hield you’d get Harrison Barnes?
By who? Buddy Hield? Tyrese Haliburton? Harrison Barnes?
Harrison Barnes has the same fuckwit Jeff Schwartz as his agent so idk what he is trying to do here
"Luke said they’re typically gonna run with an 8-9 man rotation, most likely:  PG: Fox, Davion  SG: Haliburton, Buddy   SF: Harrison Barnes, Terrence Davis  PF: Mo Harkless (with various players rotating in to the 4 like Barnes, Thompson, or whatever the matchup allows for)  C: Holmes, Thompson  Based on the preseason these were the guys that gelled really well and Harkless has really surprised us as a role player since the end of last season. I think more often you’ll see lineups with Harkless and Barnes at the 4 because of the defensive versatility to guard perimeter players, which is likely why Bagley is out of the rotation. No room at Center either, Bagley isn’t strong enough on defense and Alex Len is our 3rd string C"
Next stop: Buddy Hield and Harrison Barnes.
"&gt;Exactly it's not that these players are getting overpaid it's that the best players of the league get way underpaid because their actual value is astronomical.  I actually think it's both.  Obviously guys like Steph and LeBron are WAY underpaid. But the number of guys with Messi-like value is TINY.   And my guess is that someone like Klay (healthy) is probably pretty close to properly valued.   But Tobias Harris, Andrew Wiggins, Kristaps, CJ McCollum etc are overpaid. The Mavs overpaid Harrison Barnes when they signed him from the Warriors. And you look at those guys, and, generally, their contact is set by (or relative to) the max.   One point of reference might be shoe deals. There are three players with shoe deals worth over $20m annually: LeBron, KD, and Steph. (Steph was over $30m, but I saw something that suggests it's only $20m now.) Nobody else is over $15m."
"I don’t think he’s the better player to have right at this moment, but from a legacy perspective it’s actually pretty interesting because you could make a case today for Giannis over KD on the *all time* list just based on accolades and achievements, which is shocking given KD is 6 years older.   2 MVPs, 1 Championship, 1 FMVP, 1 DPOY, 3 First Team All NBA, 2 Second Team  Vs.  1 MVP, 2 Championships, 2 FMVPs, 0 DPOY, 6 First Team All NBA, 3 Second Team  KD has a few more All NBA nods and an extra championship, although both his championships were with that Warriors team which also won when KD was replaced with Harrison Barnes a couple years previous. Meanwhile Giannis has an extra MVP and a DPOY, and his title came with an underdog supporting cast. Maybe the All Pros put KD a hair ahead, but it’s really really close.   (Mostly this is probably just a reflection on how catastrophic the GSW run was for KD’s legacy, in that the Championships are less impressive and he also effectively blocked himself out from the major individual accolades like MVP or DPOY)"
"Kings would have still bungled their draft.   Sac front office and Sac Homer's response to MPJ?  &gt;We have Buddy Hield, Harrison Barnes, and Bogi, no on MPJ yes on BAGLEY AND HIS TRASH DAD.  Fuck.  I wish we got to see Fox and Luka run shit in Sac.   But even if Luka had gone to the Sacramento, the Kangz would have fucked it up.  Waste a good chunk of Lukas career.  We wouldn't be seeing those maestro performances."
"Blowout trade idea of the day. Just made impossible due to Brogdon's extension but I want to get thoughts on it anyway:   **Sixers receive:**   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Andrew Wiggins  **Warriors receive:**  * Domantas Sabonis  * Buddy Hield  **Pacers receive:**  * James Wiseman  * Davion Mitchell  * Marvin Bagley  * Seth Curry  * Kings 1st  **Kings receive:**  * Ben Simmons  * Furkan Korkmaz  Sixers starting 5: Malcolm Brogdon/Danny Green/Andrew Wiggins/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid  Warriors starting 5 (by playoffs): Steph Curry/Jordan Poole/Klay Thompson/Draymond Green/Domantas Sabonis  Pacers starting 5: Seth Curry/Caris Levert/TJ Warren/Marvin Bagley/Myles Turner  Kings starting 5: De'Aaron Fox/Tyrese Haliburton/Harrison Barnes/Ben Simmons/Richaun Holmes  Sixers flip Ben Simmons and Seth Curry into Malcolm Brogdon and Andrew Wiggins, fixing their roster construction. They're a better playoff team than before.   Warriors turn Wiggins and Wiseman into all-star Sabonis and flamethrower Buddy Hield. We'd have Steph/Poole/Hield as guards, Klay/Otto/Kuminga/Moody/Iguodala/Juan as wings, Dray/Bjelica/Looney as our bigs. That's solid top to bottom.   Kings flip two of their excess guards and a failed prospect plus a pick for Ben Simmons and a bench guard, it's a no brainer for them. Fox/Haliburton/Barnes/Simmons/Holmes is the best lineup they would have put out in a long time  Who says no?"
Their supporting cast is similar imo. Andrew Wiggins is a lot better than Harrison Barnes was
"Hassan Whiteside, Harrison Barnes, Otto Porter, Andre Drummond, Al Horford. Max Players at one point, the stretch isn't of the imagination it's of what a max player is. He's not a super max player, but I'd argue neither is Gobert he's certainly a max player though."
DAME 2018-2019 KLAY 2015-2016 DRAYMOND  and bunch of good role players like 2020 Harrison Barnes and a big that can play defense  A worse warriors sd
"Andrew Wiggins GSW guide to success  Step 1: Phone in regular season; try just hard enough on defense to get accolades from pundits  Step 2: Make playoffs with Klay, Steph, and Draymond healthy  Step 3: Harrison Barnes your way to a few open corner 3s per game.   Step 4: Team wins championship. Profit"
It's kind of scary because THJ is basically their second option behind Luka and he plays just a tiny bit worse than Harrison Barnes who is the King's like 4th option.
"I’m just staying away, but he’s like Harrison barnes type player to me. Not enough value to actually get wins at anything above 15 mill"
LMAO. He's a good defender and he shot 38% from 3 last year. He would easily get harrison barnes money (around $20M a year)
"I know the exact effing game you're talking about. I remember Steph got pushed into a screen set by Dwight Howard, yet Steph got called for a foul. Even on the play where Kobe tore his achilles, it was a non-contact injury that led to him falling down, but they called a foul on Harrison Barnes despite Barnes not doing shit.   That game was so shittily called, and the Warriors should've won that effing game."
Something something 2016 Harrison Barnes
"I mean, a lot of people are showing resistance to any positive opinions on the Warriors, but if Klay comes back as Klay, and then you have Toscano Anderson and Poole, that’s about as good as Shawn Livingston and Harrison Barnes. Maybe not quite as good but close. They’ll be a dangerous team for sure."
"As a warriors fan, no way.  If Wiggins can get to where Harrison Barnes was on offense last year, I’d be ecstatic."
&gt; He is very overpaid.   People get too lost in this mis-understanding of a max slot. Look how we got here. We had KD and KD walked for nothing. And we were over the cap so we couldn't sign another KD or any max player for that matter. So they worked out a sign and trade so KD could be paid more and we could keep our slot with D-Lo. Who is also a max player who isn't close to KD in value. But he held the slot for us. So we turned D-Lo into Wiggins and Kuminga (#7 pick). Wiggins definitely fit our team better than D-Lo s o we basically replaced KD with a similar version of Harrison Barnes. Also a max player wherever he is now. There's simply no way to trade Wiggins and get an equal return for him for less money. So he's NOT overpaid. He just occupies a slot where better players also sit. But you're not getting any of them for Wiggins.
"Athletic-19 PPG-48/38/75-v good defending SF/PF’s dont just grow on trees. There’s probably less than 12 of them in the league  If KD never comes to GS, they probably max out Harrison Barnes. And Wiggins is better than Barnes was the Harrison Barnes role for our team"
"He feels like a better version of Harrison Barnes, who had a similar route after his stint on the Warriors. He was a solid piece for the Mavs and now the Kings, but doesn't necessarily push them over the top. If Poole really performs this year, dubs may need some of that salary to sign his next contract, and there is no better time to trade Wiggs than going into his final year of the max."
"Wiggins is perfect for us. Good defense, ability to shoot, and consistent scoring. And he plays pretty well in our offensive and defensive schemes. He fills the Harrison Barnes role amazingly.  He’s just slightly overpaid. He’s also an Ironman and can fill in the minutes, which in our current situation is/was desperately needed"
Harrison Barnes
"Bias but a few of the Kings players.  Tyrese Haliburton. Able to initiate the offense or be the secondary playmaker. Efficient shooter. Smart player and a cheap contract.  Buddy Hield. Every team could use an elite shooter.  And maybe Harrison Barnes? Had a great year shooting 39% from 3. Good size, solid defense, just a steady player all-around."
Harrison Barnes?
"The league got smaller, faster, and shot more threes.  This resulted in opening up the lane substantially. Used to be there would be two really tall dudes in there you had to dodge on the way to the rim, now there's usually only one. The result is more space for driving lanes.   The Warriors were the fulcrum that changed the league, but it wasn't just Steph and Klay and Draymond. A lot of it was Harrison Barnes. The point is not that Harrison Barnes was so great. The point is that with a fast, scrambling, switching defense, Harrison Barnes could guard most 4s in the league. But most fours couldn't keep up with him. And if you could win the battle against a traditional four with a player of the quality of Harrison Barnes (that is to say, basically league average), then there wasn't much of a place for a traditional four in the league any more.   Guys work harder on defense than they have at any point in the league's history, and have been given more flexibility in how to approach defense than ever before. Crazy as it sounds, NBA defenses are probably as good as they've ever been, if not better.   But they to cover so much more territory, now."
"Kd can’t win a ring with Westbrook, harden (two teams), kyrie. Steph made Harrison barnes look like an allstar and won him a ring"
Harrison Barnes
Golden State blatantly tanked for Harrison Barnes
You either don't watch Harrison Barnes or OG or both.
100%. the OG hype is comical because he’s basically harrison barnes
"So far, stoked. We've gone undefeated between preseason and summer league (SL champs!) and Davion hasn't lost a game yet in his NBA career.   Of course, we'll see how the only guards, centers, and Harrison Barnes (and Moe) strategy works before we inevitably make a move and bring in another forward for depth."
"He was fading away on Mo Harkless and Harrison Barnes, I was confused as hell just watching."
Teams like the Kings need a Harrison Barnes
"The funniest shit was they finally took a 1 pt lead and then Luke Walton, against a lineup of Russ, Bron, AD, Jordan and Howard decided to do the worst possible thing and run a 4 guard lineup in which the Kings decided to go on a 12pt run. Somehow. Somehow with Mitchell, Davis, Fox, Buddy, Barnes (HARRISON FUCKING BARNES PLAYING CENTER) they went on a 12pt run and just beat the Lakers with a 4 guard lineup with Harrison Barnes being the tallest Kings player."
Anytime I see Harrison Barnes in a clip I always remember the time when Shaq said “Harrison Barnaes is still in the league!?” while watching kings highlights on tnt. lol
"It's a tough one, Ayton has a higher ceiling IMO but it's easier to replace what he brings to the team currently. Positionally, you'd be paying around 20M annually to replace Bridges with within equivalent or better player like Harrison Barnes and you'd be doing it for a finished article without the upside Bridges has. You would be speeding up your timeline for very little gain instead of letting this team grow together. I really don't love the amount of salary the Suns are committing to this core but I don't see a better path. They did make the Finals so it's not like it's a bad core at all."
"East: rozier, levert, jerami grant, tobias harris, turner .  West: murray, mccollum, harrison barnes, aaron gordon, wood"
My bad. Harrison Barnes through me off.
&gt; Harrison Barnes.  Are you really a Warriors fan?
"Fred Van Vleet, Malcolm Brogdon, both Bogdanovics, Lonzo, Scary Terry Rozier, Harrison Barnes.  All very high character good players who can be on the floor at the highest levels of the playoffs without being a liability who were available on the market as non-max players.  I'd rather overpay them a bit and trade away a questionable guy with better talent and not max Ben Simmons/D-Lo/Wiggins/John Wall."
&gt; Is OG even a top 100 player?  Is that a serious question? You could argue that guys like Evan Fournier and  Harrison Barnes are top 100 players and OG is much better than them.
"Crazy to think that four years ago the Mavs were probably thinking of building a core around DSJ, Harrison Barnes and Mo Bamba.   I couldn’t be more grateful for the team we have now despite its flaws"
"Curry definitely played worse in that finals series compared to his season but he was still a serviceable player. It's insane how if Curry posts up above average league TS% in a series it's considered a choke, simply because we're so used to his insane shooting numbers.  The only one who truly choked was Harrison Barnes. Literally missed every open 3 shot when Steph was doubled. Was held to 0 points in a game with no one guarding him, it's insane how people forget this.  People also seem to forget that 2016 Steph single handedly ended the OKC KD-Russ dynasty in the same playoffs."
THJ doesn't even come up with the same stats as Harrison Barnes who isn't even the 3rd best player on the Kings.
Do you mean Kuminga and moody?  Or wiseman and… Harrison Barnes?
"i absolutely promise you the sixers will not take a trade around marvin fucking bagley and harrison barnes. whether you think they should or not, it will not happen. regardless of where you think his value is. it is not happening."
"Like I said, we all know they would’ve just brought back Harrison Barnes instead of KD. That would’ve tied up most of their cap and with Klay and Draymond getting new deals as well they wouldn’t have had any real game changing depth."
"The kings probably keep two or Fox/Mitchell/Haliburton and can insert Simmons into a starting lineup of the two remaining guards, Harrison Barnes/Bagley, and Richaun Holmes. They have a weaker bench assuming Hield is in the trade, but I'd argue that team could be better overall than the Blazers and Mavs."
"I've said for a minute that if Sacramento is serious on the Simmons sweepstake that the offer would have to be Harrison Barnes, TT and one of either Davion Mitchell/Tyrese Haliburton."
"Doesn’t change the fact that Toronto had the best combination of defensive matchups for all the Warriors top players along with Nick Nurse who employed strategies they hadn’t seen before. With Kawhi, Siakam, OG, FVV, Lowry, Gasol, Ibaka etc. Raps were a defensive powerhouse (most efficient playoff defense since the 04 Pistons) and they had the offensive firepower to match.  Warriors would’ve brought back Harrison Barnes on a 20 mil+ deal most likely and there wouldn’t be a whole lot of other meaningful depth given that ties up their cap. They were only able to sign KD that one year because of the Cap spike."
"Question from NBA.com’s GM Survey 2021-22:  Which active player will make the best head coach someday?  1. Chris Paul, Phoenix – 34%  2. Rajon Rondo, Lakers – 14%  3. T.J. McConnell, Indiana – 10%  4. Mike Conley Utah – 7% Udonis Haslem, Miami – 7% Garrett Temple, New Orleans – 7%  &gt; Also receiving votes: Harrison Barnes, Sacramento; Malcolm Brogdon, Indiana; Draymond Green, Golden State; Joe Ingles, Utah; LeBron James, Lakers; Patty Mills, Brooklyn"
"We were in a really weird spot though. Can't really fault him for not being able to consistently compete with the top heavy West from 2012-2019 with an aging star. Ain't no one teaming up with 35 year old Dirk when you could join the warriors or lebron. We had to overpay for Parsons just for him to fall apart as soon as we gave him the contract. That fucked our cap badly. We paid Harrison Barnes because no one else wanted to come to a team they knew weren't real contenders. Then Dirk is almost 40, we're a lottery team, and we land Luka."
You gettin Buddy Hield and Harrison Barnes and that's it.
My money is on Harrison Barnes again lol
Didn’t Thanasis do that same thing to Harrison Barnes in the Fiba cup?
"I mean the 2014 Warriors have to be up there right? Still young, but they had all the players that would win it all the very next year. Switch out David Lee for Harrison Barnes and get Steve Kerr as a coach. But, talent-wise, hard to beat as a first round exit team."
Blazers swap their best player of all time and CJ McCollum for Ben Simmons and Harrison Barnes 😂😂
"Portland gives up the best player in this entire fiasco and ends up with Ben Simmons and Harrison Barnes? Go home Bleacher Report, you're drunk."
"Portland says no.  2 picks, Ben Simmons, and Harrison Barnes for CJ, Dame, and Nas? Nah bro BR high as Morey right now. We aren’t even getting young guys!"
"Blazers should say no. They go from Dame/CJ to Simmons/Harrison Barnes. Sixers make out like bandits, they get Embiid/Dame/Beal - probably the best team in the NBA lmao"
"That's fair. I just think we have a different opinion of ""way better"", perhaps.  I think Lebron is way better than Harrison Barnes. Sure."
We resigned everyone in the current generation  Harrison Barnes  Buddy Heild  And Holmes   I think being able to be in California is a huge advantage even if it is Sacramento  You still get great weather and are close to everything.  Free agents sign in 4-5 markets and mostly it has to do with money and basketball not the city  Cleveland signed Lebron and Kevin Love as free agents and that city is miles below Sacramento
"I only have data from the 2004-05 season onwards, but here are all the lineups with at least 100 games:  * ('Ben Wallace', 'Chauncey Billups', 'Rasheed Wallace', 'Richard Hamilton', 'Tayshaun Prince') 227 * ('Kendrick Perkins', 'Kevin Garnett', 'Paul Pierce', 'Rajon Rondo', 'Ray Allen') 221 * ('Kendrick Perkins', 'Kevin Durant', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Serge Ibaka', 'Thabo Sefolosha') 209 * ('Al Horford', 'Joe Johnson', 'Josh Smith', 'Marvin Williams', 'Mike Bibby') 180 * ('David West', 'George Hill', 'Lance Stephenson', 'Paul George', 'Roy Hibbert') 171 * ('Andrew Bynum', 'Derek Fisher', 'Kobe Bryant', 'Metta World Peace', 'Pau Gasol') 144 * ('Andrew Bogut', 'Draymond Green', 'Harrison Barnes', 'Klay Thompson', 'Stephen Curry') 136 * ('Jeff Green', 'Kevin Durant', 'Nenad Krstic', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Thabo Sefolosha') 133 * ('Bradley Beal', 'John Wall', 'Marcin Gortat', 'Markieff Morris', 'Otto Porter Jr.') 128 * ('Danny Green', 'Kawhi Leonard', 'Tiago Splitter', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tony Parker') 124 * ('Damian Lillard', 'LaMarcus Aldridge', 'Nicolas Batum', 'Robin Lopez', 'Wesley Matthews') 114 * ('Bruce Bowen', 'Manu Ginobili', 'Rasho Nesterovic', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tony Parker') 110 * ('Andre Roberson', 'Kevin Durant', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Serge Ibaka', 'Steven Adams') 109 * ('Jason Collins', 'Jason Kidd', 'Nenad Krstic', 'Richard Jefferson', 'Vince Carter') 106 * ('Derrick Favors', 'Donovan Mitchell', 'Joe Ingles', 'Ricky Rubio', 'Rudy Gobert') 106 * ('Andrei Kirilenko', 'Carlos Boozer', 'Deron Williams', 'Mehmet Okur', 'Ronnie Brewer') 101"
"Look I’m not about to argue w you over the hypothetical roster GSW would’ve gotten had KD not joined. I’m and not going to argue about whether GSW w Harrison Barnes and Al Horford is better than GSW w KD. The point remains, KD made major contributions to that team, and GSW would not have won two back to back chips without him. You don’t want to give him credit bc of arbitrary “context” and you seem prepared to die on that hill. So there’s really no debate to be had here."
"We’re gonna act like 2019 never happened? The warriors were still contenders without Durant. Not “best post season record” prohibitive favorites, but still capable of winning. If he doesn’t sign they still could’ve retained Harrison Barnes or gotten Al Horford (a stretch 5 to add size and defense to the death lineup).   Wade won in 2006. In 2008 the heat won 43 games 43 games, missing the playoffs then won 47 games followed by a first round gentlemen’s sweep in 2009. The warriors won 67 wins and the championship then won 73 and were one possession away from repeating. That comparison is ridiculous"
"Is Dillion Brooks, Jonas Valanciunas, and Kyle Anderson really much better than Richaun Holmes, Harrison Barnes, and Buddy Hield?"
"Ah, you're right, thanks for the correction. The whole thing was kinda surprising to me, the little I knew about Carlisle personally was like, the Jim Carrey jokes and playing piano at Harrison Barnes' wedding.  After all of this stuff coming out about Carlisle being a jerk, I wonder if Mavs fans feel any different about the whole Rondo kerfuffle?"
"We're also hurt by a bunch of smaller moves. Seth for Josh Richardson, Delon Wright, all of our draft picks last year, even the Harrison Barnes trade.   The KP trade was a worthwhile swing, but we don't seem to make any good smaller moves either."
It's giving me Harrison Barnes PTSD
"Bruh we had 5 proven 38% and higher 3pt shooter in high volumes in the roster lol (THJ, Bullock, KP, Maxi, Brunson). Not counting Dodo or Sterling Brown around 37%. We fucked if Luka injured though because no one can dribble more than 3 times lol. We are just Hayward or Harrison Barnes away from contender :("
Harrison Barnes sends his regards
Only reason Portland trades CJ is for someone that really moves the needle for them.  Safe to say Harrison Barnes isn't that type of player.
"&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ondr5i/oc_a_fourteam_trade_between_indiana_portland/ &gt;  &gt; Here's the write-up I did on that 4-team trade. Long-story short, this would only happen if Portland's defense continues to suck ass and they need to move and get a proper 2-way wing. &gt;  &gt; CJ is better than Harrison Barnes in a vacuum, but sometimes you gotta go with the better fit."

"I think a lot of that was due to Luke Walton trying to save his job. Another reason is due to personell. Like John Collins, I think Bagley is ultimately can be a stretch 4 or small ball 5 but unlike Atlanta the Kings are pretty flimsy at that 3/4 position. Outside of Harrison Barnes it's Metu and Harkless? Not great. So Bagley has to play the 4."
"&gt; Coby is just straight up better than Ross,  Bias talking   &gt; Coby won’t be our 9th man though, I feel like you’re underrating his value to this team as a scoring punch off the bench  Lonzo, Lavine, Demar, Vuc, Bradley, Caruso, DJJ, Green. That’s 8 players I’m more confident in.  &gt; he’s literally the only shot creator we have besides Zach and Demar.  And I’m saying he’s never proven himself to be a good shot creator, and you’re already all-in, you should leave your 2-3 allstar team i n the hands of a guy that hasn’t proven he can even score at a league average efficiency.  If I told you a random team that was 7-3 and a contender is relying on a 21 year old whose best year is scoring on 54% TS for a lottery team, you’d say that team should improve on them to increase your playoff odds.  If you were able to acquire someone like Jerami Grant or Harrison Barnes, and you went into the playoffs with a Lonzo-Lavine-Demar-Grant/Barnes-Vuc with Caruso/Green/Bradley rotating in and Lavine/Demar playing 40+ minutes staggered, that bench scoring punch you talk about becomes soooo much less important"

Harrison Barnes another game winner potentially 👀
Remember Harrison Barnes... :(
"Its been 10 games lmao. With your stupid take it would mean that Harrison Barnes is better than Embiid as well, or that Cole Anthony is better than Damian Lillard."
"Seriously, never thought the Cavs would build a potential contender this quick. They are maybe 1-2 years of development and a solid 3 and D wing away from being legit. Put someone like Harrison Barnes or similar on that team give them another season or two. They are close if Sexton injury isn't too bad."
Getting Harrison Barnes as he's playing right now for Ben Simmons would be a total fleece on Morey's part.
Everyone is super high on Davion actually. And Harrison Barnes for that matter.
"If Harrison Barnes can do it, so can Ricky"
"Would it shock anyone if Vivek wanted a big name like Simmons and traded Davion, Harrison Barnes, and a 1st? I know he's not the GM but the owner does have final say"
They didn't even have anything enticing to get Harrison Barnes

"Harrison Barnes been the Kings best player to start this season. I remember when he got traded by the Mavs mid game, the Kings signed him to an extension which at the time seems like an overpay, now actually looks like a perfectly good deal. He been shooting the 3 so well.  Mavs should never have traded him, they did that bc they didnt wanna pay him and wanted that money for Pozingis... Major oof, now they legit need a guy like Harrison Barnes who's a good combo forward, can guard 3-4, can legit shoot the ball and just overall solid fit in their position of need"
I remember when people said he was better than Harrison Barnes during that big 2016 free agency.
"Others in the top 10 of Raptor War!    Derrick rose, Harrison Barnes, Jalen Bronson, Royce O'Neal, FVF and Jarret Allen."
https://kingsherald.com/articles/nba-trade-rumors-boston-celtics-marcus-smart-trade-sacramento-kings-harrison-barnes-nemanja-bjelica-trade/  I also remember Sam amick mentioning it on a radio show with the trade deadline nearing
"Plenty of people valued Mobley higher before the draft. It just so happened that Detroit's GM wasn't one of those people.   People want player evaluations to be simple and linear, but they're not. People are on different growth curves. Sometimes players look really bad for a while and then get good. Sometimes vice versa. We won't know who is really the best player until they've all turned into whomever they're going to turn in to.   I mean, look at Tyler Herro. Two years ago: ""great young player, could be the centerpiece of a trade for Harden."" Last year: ""The bubble was a fluke. He's smoke and mirrors. Not that good."" This year: ""Okay, I guess the bubble wasn't a fluke."" Happens with non-star players, too. Harrison Barnes looked competent as a rookie, and looked like somebody who wouldn't get a second NBA contract in his second year. He was then the #3 guy in minutes on a team that dominated the league for two years.   Let's roll back into the time machine. It's clear that Steph Curry is the best player from the 2009 draft. My question for you is: in what year did that become a reasonable position to hold? Tyreke Evans won ROY (although at the time I felt, as a totally biased Warrior fan, that Steph was clearly better). But even Warrior fans who were super high on him at the time weren't ranking him over Blake in 2012 or 2013. In 2015, there were a lot of people arguing that Harden deserved the MVP (it was fairly pointed when the players award went to Harden).   It probably wasn't until 2016 and his SECOND MVP that people recognized that he was the best player from that draft. Seven years later. But even still there were some people who weren't converted until last year when they saw that he could put up monster numbers carrying a team.   So you want to make the definitive ranking of guys from this draft before they've played 10 games?   Slow down and enjoy the ride."
Harrison Barnes
Harrison Barnes and Miles Bridges are all nba so far.
Boston could of had Harrison Barnes for Smart at the deadline last year but Ainge thought he could trade Nesmith and a first round pick for him lol
"Yeah but trading Buddy could've kept KCP and Caruso. In fact if packaged well, you could've gotten Harrison Barnes along with Buddy"
"I remember hearing that Harrison Barnes dunked in sixth grade, and that Westbrook was a senior in high school. Late bloomer  Here’s Andrew Wiggins at 13 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ47CuHVFvA&amp;feature=youtu.be"
"He's not quite there yet, this is number 3, which is Harrison Barnes numbers  https://www.basketball-reference.com/friv/buzzer-beaters.html"
I remember attending a Kings game at the new arena around the Holidays back in 2019.   I follow the Kings just to see what’s up with them but didn’t know the roster aside from Harrison Barnes.  I remember only two things from that day.    1. Barnes was laying eggs.   2. Richaun Holmes was the one player who stood.  Dude was everywhere and doing very thing and he stood out all the way from the nose bleeds.   I had to keep Googling him just to learn more about this guy and then I asked myself “why do ya need Bagley?”
"Sure.  But Mark Jackson had Steph Curry and Klay Thompson and numerous excellent passers, and instead of setting picks and letting them shoot, he slowed things down and posted up Harrison Barnes, over and over.  Years after every other coach in the game figured out that the post up was outmoded and inefficient, he kept doing it.  Like it was still 1993.  And he did it with a guy who is terrible at posting up.  but I'm willing to accept that Boylen and Jackson BOTH suck ass as coaches"
"He was right; unfortunately he recognized that he had the best shooting backcourt of all time and \*still\* decided that we should spend more of our offense emphasizing the Harrison Barnes iso.  So while I'll give him credit for that statement (and instilling the defensive mindset), without Kerr I don't think GS wins a championship.  Curry doesn't win an MVP.  And the league doesn't change to the 3-point game it has since become.  Oddly, the Warriors firing Mark Jackson changed the way the whole league now plays."
"Of everything I’ve seen/heard about Harrison he’s been incredible this year. Always a guy I’ll root for, no matter where. Even the queens.  What about a wiggins for barnes swap? Get the old band back together."
I like how Harrison Barnes was the only one to not make it into the title.
"dirk was holding harrison barnes and doug mcdermott back, just giving dirk a taste of his own medicine"
Fr lol mans best play vs the Spurs was harrison Barnes post up
Wiggins is the new Harrison Barnes and this is the new Strength in Numbers squad
He's like what Harrison Barnes was but probably won't choke in the playoffs
"I see everyone asking about PG, and rightfully so.  Now...Where the fuck is Harrison Barnes? :)"
"To add: He traded Justin Jackson and Zach Randolph for Harrison Barnes, then signed Harrison to a contract that Harrison has played up to for most of the time we’ve had him.   Also he didn’t just trade for Bogdan, he traded Marquese Chriss for Bogdan and three attempts to draft good players (lol). Signed Bjelica before Bjelica could exit the country. I mean still not saying he was good overall, but he definitely did some things right"
Nothing was more fun than that and having /u/rabsho complain about harrison barnes. It's engrained in my memory.
"Hard disagree. All of those players are amazing without Curry. Klay Thompson can take over a game on his own and can run around and get open without Curry. Iguodala was all defensive and an all star before coming to the warriors. Bogut had been an all defensive player before Curry. Harrison Barnes was still developing on the warriors but its pretty clear watching him in Sacramento that he has plenty of talent. We saw last season how far Curry can take a team without the great supporting cast. Also, a lot of credit has to go to Kerr for maximizing the talent that the warriors had. I think Curry is a much better player than Westbrook, but that individual Westbrook season was unprecedented and Westbrook played far beyond the player he normally is."
"A little different since the warriors were stacked whereas the thunder were definitely a much lesser team. Westbrook's determination to take on the burden of doing it all when KD left was a sight to see. He was on a mission and no one could stop him. Curry had the arguably the second best shooter in nba history, an elite defensive front court of Draymond and Andrew Bogut. Probably the best 6th man in Iguodala and a top 3 and D player in Harrison Barnes. Curry was able to dominate as much as he did because he was surrounded by an all time team. Westbrook made it happen despite all odds."
"idk, we traded seth and harrison barnes for literally nothing"
"Still, any one out of these three:  1. not trading Harrison Barnes for nothing 2. not trading Seth Curry for nothing 3. not whiffing on the Josh Green pick  would have our team in a much better position now"
"We’re talking about this season so maybe he should be dropped. But at least it made sense to list him given his body of work, unlike your boy. And Dame will bounce back. Btw ZERO winshares in 8 games. Can take out Kawhi too whom I hesitated including to begin with.   But then add Ja, DeMar, Brown, Miles Bridges, Harrison Barnes, Jarrett Allen, John Collins, McCollum, Herro, Sabonis, Dejounte Murray, OG, Valenciunas, Brogdon, Richaun Holmes, Myles Turner, Draymond, Tobias Harris, Lowry, Randle, Seth, Montrezl Harrel, Al Horford, SGA, Ayton, Christian Wood - all winning players btw  Top 45 maybe"
Not as weird as salary dumping Harrison Barnes for free agents that never materialized.  Really poor series of decisions by Mavs after drafting Luka.
&gt;#####A new season means new players stepping to the forefront. Here are a handful who look like they could make a leap two weeks into 2021-22.  --- Included players:  &gt;* Miles Bridges {CHA} * Ja Morant {MEM} * Tyler Herro {MIA} * OG Anunoby {TOR} * Cole Anthony {ORL} * Harrison Barnes {SAC} * Desmond Bane {MEM} * Jakob Poeltl {SAS} * Cam Reddish {ATL} * Mo Bamba {ORL}
all young guys and then there’s a random Harrison Barnes lol. But yeah OG is that guy people finally seeing it.
"Adding another SG will definitely impact his minutes and touches.   Harrison Barnes,   Scoring 7 more PPG (averaging 24 PPG), 3 more rebounds a game, improved his 3 point efficiency, his FTA a game, and is scoring on 67% TS."
"Not even saying that’s not true, but voters will not give Harrison Barnes MIP"
I got Top 3.   Miles Bridges   Tyler Herro   Jonas Valencunis   Harrison Barnes nd Lonzo Next Up
"Harrison Barnes should be up higher than most of those on the list. Bane is a sophomore, so I don't expect him to get consideration."
- Harrison Barnes has increased his PPG by 7pts from last year  - Tyler Herro has increased his PPG by 7pts from last year  - Miles Bridges has increased his PPG by **12pts** from last year  These are some of the largest jumps in terms of PPG over last year. So I'd give it to Miles Bridges.

He was right to be mad. He breathed on JV and got a foul. Harrison Barnes did something even more atrocious and got called for a foul later: he brushed someone
"Pels should consider guarding Harrison Barnes, imo"
wait until you find out what we did with harrison barnes trade

You should never have traded Harrison Barnes
"Walton is just not a good head coach, he's a fine assistant. But being head coach requires player management, Xs and Os, as well as in game management and adjustments. He has struggled with the last part and his decisions are baffling. The Kings are bailing him out, especially Harrison Barnes and Buffy hot shooting.

Harrison Barnes resurgence
Never seen such a good player brick literal spoon fed gimmies like that before. It felt like he was 4/30 in the games I saw fr.  Joe screwed joe. It was Harrison Barnes level of embarrassing but he gets less flack bc the nets had so many other factors go wrong.
"We are a scheduled loss (trailblazers day after lakers) and a Harrison Barnes shot away from an “expected record”. Overall just eh yeah short offseason and Booker with covid right before the season, just excuses for a slow start that’s all."
Hot Take...... If I was the Pistons I would sell high on Grant while his value is still high (actually feel the same about Harrison Barnes)
and the seth curry trade  and the harrison barnes trade
too late now but was thinking harrison barnes in the summer.
Regress KD’s scoring and percentages to the mean and he averages around 2018 Harrison Barnes
Kings are fucked when Harrison Barnes comes back down to earth.
Forgot to mention Harrison Barnes playing like a star for the Kings

"And some Zach Randolph lmao  Also some good ol’ negative player equity by trading Harrison Barnes in the middle of a game and embarrassing him. I swear to God, he wasn’t a perfect player, (though last year and this year he looks damn good) but he shot well and could create his own shot and I would love to be able to trot out Luka/THJ/DFS/HB/KP, that’s a great lineup.  I am tired of this team trading away the guys who want to be here and then wondering why we don’t land free agents"
Wiseman was just at the top of a really bad big-man class. Warriors draft history since Harrison Barnes has been abysmal.
"Idk that I disagree but beating Portland and Phoenix and then staying competitive with Utah and golden state (and Dallas) has been pretty good for us.  On the one hand, if Fox plays like last year we’re 6-0. He’s been pretty bad to start the season. On the other hand, if Harrison Barnes doesn’t randomly start off with a career year, we’re 0-6.  That’s just the way the nba goes, lots of variables. If we play to our potential, I think being around .500 or above by the end of the season is totally doable. But yeah you can say that for just about any team, we just gotta go out and do it"
"Haliburton shot 41% ONLY because no one bothered to guard him out there cuz his shot is horrible. He doesn't even know if he's supposed to jump or not. And even then only 2 makes a game. I'll be shocked if he tops 35% this year with defenses paying any attention to him. Harrison Barnes for that matter averaged 1.7 makes a game, that is not a threat.   We can agree to disagree on Whiteside, I don't feel he's worth a roster spot at any price so I still think they overpaid. Maybe 2-3 games all season where he meaningfully contributed to a win. As many DNP- coaches decisions as games played."
Harrison Barnes playing the best basketball of his career
"Except it is exactly the same just shifted from failing to build around Cousins to failing to build around Fox. 3-4 key young players that have no other talent around them and a terrible coaching staff and an incompetent front office that has done such an awful job that no one in the NBA wants to play for SAC.  Front office just continually either overpays for completely washed (Hassan Whiteside last year, Tristan Thompson this year) big men or takes huge risks on drafting injury prone (Harry Giles, Marvin Bagley III) big men, or pays average role players as if they're stars (Harrison Barnes).   The argument could be made that they aren't focused on big men and are trying to emulate the small ball movement but that doesn't hold either cuz the small ball movement is predicated on good 3pt shooting and players that can defend multiple positions and Buddy Hield is the only good 3pt shooter on the roster and they don't have anyone that can guard more than 2 positions.   Throw in a coaching staff that doesn't even understand what defense is and has to bank on an undersized rookie PG to bail them out with his 1 on 1 ability and it will be another long wait for relevancy."
I saw this post title and came to say Harrison Barnes. Maybe he's not going so under-the-radar after all
"Sort of hard to calculate it in bulk since the 2019-2020 season messes everything up and you have to modify it by hand depending on how many games their team platyed... but so far it looks like:  Buddy Hield and Joe Ingles with 99% of available games played, T.J. McConnell with 97%, and Andrew Wiggins with 96%. Then a bunch around 95% like Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Jordan Clarkson, Damian Lillard, and Harrison Barnes."
Harrison Barnes is an MVP candidate and I refuse to believe otherwise.
"Most Durable of all time, prob AC Green, current maybe LeBron of Harrison Barnes"
Harrison Barnes &gt; KD  Warriors chose wrong in 2016 sadly
"It’s funny how people ignore this fact   We’ll probably just get downvoted without anyone actually commenting otherwise   Durant’s foot was literally an inch too close from winning the series. That’s without Kyrie, with Harden who visibly could barely move and Joe Harris choking on Harrison Barnes levels"
Agreed. Harrison Barnes is playing at an MVP level so far.
Turns out your sicrit play being harrison barnes post up from the left isn't a great play. Kerr even had klay making lay ups although that could just be klay
This has Wiggins deserves the max more than Embiid vibes all over again.   Ill take the injury prone superstar over Harrison Barnes 2.0 than you very much.
"A lot of players have been hot too  After 40 games, a.k.a a good sample size, most of them  return to the mean except for a few that have an outlier season  Is Harrison Barnes a 25ppg guy on 68% TS, in a 5 game stretch anyone can be"
adam silver bout to kneecap harrison barnes to make sure that doesnt happen
GTJ decided to channel his inner Harrison Barnes after that blocked shot
"Wouldn't surprise me if the Raptors don't draft Lillard with the sixth pick. Colangelo was still the GM and if he was all-in on getting Steve Nash that summer, wouldn't surprise me if he just went for Harrison Barnes with the 6th pick. This game definitely cost them Harrison Barnes though since GS had the same record as Toronto and got the 7th pick on a coin toss."
Come on man lol. Carlisle was coaching in the west and for a certain stretch had to work with an aging dirk as #2 and harrison barnes or monta ellis as #1.

I'm sure many GMs would've done better than trade Harrison Barnes and four 2nd picks for what ended up being JJ Redick and Nico Melli.  Edit: five 2nd picks. Forgot about Cauley-Stein.
Nah they lost Harrison Barnes and added KP
If the Kings don't make the playoffs &amp; lose Harrison Barnes for nothing that would be such a bummer.
I'm convinced the reason that Harrison Barnes got traded for speaking up against that first point.
"I mean, Harrison Barnes is averaging 27 points. Perhaps the rules work just fine..."
Why did the mavs get rid of Harrison Barnes.

"Rly? I thought the opposite for two reasons, the only players whove had the scottie name were role players, second options like pippen, then 3rd option to role players in harrison barnes ( i know hes having a big season atm) and matt barnes. But atm, his play looking like hell be a superstar m"
It's going to be so strange seeing Harrison Barnes in the all-star game.
Are you telling me that Harrison Barnes isn't going to average 27 and 10 on 51%shooting? You sir...are probably right.
I rather trade for Harrison Barnes.
Do a three way trade and get Saddiq Bey and Harrison Barnes.
YesI’m referring to Harrison Barnes.
Lmao barnes isnt a Snub hes a rookie he will get there eventually. Unless you mean Harrison barnes in which case I might agree depending on if he keeps his performance up. Hes done really well this year
I have a minivan that seats Harrison Barnes
Harrison Barnes is having a really great season. He should at least be in consideration.
"Not every game at all, you're clearly a newphew. He averages almost the same amount of FTA as Harrison Barnes this season (7.00 vs. 6.53). Way below Giannis who is at 9.5, also less than Jimmy Butler, Embiid and DeRozan."
"Yes, I don't understand why our entire organization and Draymond have decided not to start a 6'6"" 31 yr old against Embiid and Ayton who outweigh him by 50 lbs.   So yeah, let's get Dray hurt, trade away our lone C with size, and trade away our future  For Harrison Barnes."
Draymond should play Center in the Playoffs which would make Iguodala or Bjelica your 4. Jeremi Grant / Harrison Barnes would be perfect for your Team
"I don't understand how Walton thought these adjustments would save his job.  You had four dynamic guards in which you could have three of them in at any time. You had switchability on the perimeter and passable spacing even if all Harkless did was flit around the perimeter and miss too many open 3s. Hence Barnes could shoot 8 threes a game and thrive doing it and get downhill whenever he wanted. You even had a big body in Len that could help stem you physicality/rebounding problem.  Was it even particularly good? No, and the 4 game slide proves that. They're missing another forward. They choke too much. But if you kept at that, I could've easily seen him keeping his job. Their net rating was the best since '06.  Then he completely flips the switch and goes with full-sized lineups again. At ALL times. He doesn't even just start with a full-sized lineup, if Metu isn't in, Bagley is. He forces Barnes back to be a full-time goddamned 3, kills the spacing, clogs the paint, and kills the switchability on defense.  This is the guy who has played Kyle Kuzma and Harrison Barnes at C. He goes to this NOW?!  And all of this for the saviors of Chimezie Metu and Marvin Bagley. For their rebounding problem. When neither of them are good defensive rebounders.  Bottom line is they were a flawed team that was using its best attributes to its advantage.  May make some statement wins, may lose pretty badly. But ever since the OKC game, they've looked like a bottom 3 team.  He has to be smoking rock."
"Stop calling Scottie Barnes ""Scottie"" or ""Barnes"". It's disrespectful to Scottie pippen and Harrison Barnes. I'm for some reason going to get really passionate about this non-issue"
the streets are saying lebron james is just a thicker version of harrison barnes
"Christian Wood, Jeremi Grant, FVV, Dinwiddie, Harrison Barnes, Valanciunas"
I would say Harrison Barnes + buddy hield are a good haul no?
&gt; I'd much rather trade Ben and assets for someone better.  You need to accept the simple fact that No team is trading you a player better than Harrison Barnes.
"Not ""easily"" but more likely than not they'd win.  A good point you could make tho is that if not kd, than another serviceable forward would take his place, around the level of Harrison Barnes / Otto Porter Jr.  Which would still make them pretty damn good, I agree.  But furthermore, I don't think the rockets assemble as such if kd doesn't go to the warriors"

"While KD took them to a next level— this was the team that went 73-9. All they needed was someone to replace Harrison Barnes and hit open 3s.   Instead they got KD. That’s why it was so unfair, that’s why everyone was so upset. They were already great, and their only discernible hole (took Harrison Barnes going like 1 for 20 from 3, 40pts from Kyrie in 3 straight games, 40 from Lebron, and 2 of the greatest plays in NBA on a night when Steph and klay had 17pts and 12pts for the warriors to lose the nba finals) got filled with KD."
Curry and the Warriors were good enough to win just not unbeatable. KD made the warriors unbeatable. I don’t think Curry needed KD at all. We lost the finals in the final minute of game 7. If Harrison Barnes was slightly less bad in the finals we would’ve never got KD in the first place. KD wanted to be seen as the best player in the world. He needed a to beat Lebron in the finals. He knew that wouldn’t happen with Westbrook.
If steph gravity so good why wasn't Harrison Barnes the next jordan
"He did not need KD, he just needed someone slightly better than Harrison Barnes. In fact even that probably isn't true - if they replayed that series a hundred times, Harrison Barnes probably plays better in 95 of them than he did in the real one and GSW wins the title. He literally just needed Harrison Barnes to play 10% better. The only thing he needed KD for was for the team to be so overpowered that there wasn't even a chance of losing, which is exactly why it's controversial"
"Suns - it's honestly McGee, although Ayton and Bridges can be close. Pistons - Hami Diallo, even though he doesn't get much playing time. Thunder - Dort lately, but Bazley has the hops no one other on the team has. Wizards - I'd guess Trez, because of his intensity. Cavs - Allen right now, but Mobley can take the crown. Pacers - Isaiah Jackson?? It can't be Kelan Martin or Brogdon, right? Spurs  - Keldon Johnson and it ain't particularly close, even though Lonnie Walker might argue so. Kings - Richaun Holmes. He is a bowling ball. But Harrison Barnes can surprise you with the hops every now and then. Fox can do some mean dunks. Mavs - DFS."
"He did the Harrison Barnes role far better than Harrison Barnes, which is what the Warriors needed at the time."
Because the new current warriors main pieces are made from the Kevin durants sign and trade. What don't you get ?.  There's no what ifs it's just pure facts. You see how your trying to deny the truth like every other warriors or curry fan by creating what if scenarios or downplaying players.  2016 Harrison Barnes 11ppg was better then Wiggins 20ppg riiight....   The point is literally in my first comment but your persistent in denying facts by creating fake scenarios like everyone else commenting on my comment.   That's like a clippers fan denying cp3 sign and trade didn't create pg13 and kawhi. But they won't.
"Dude they would have just resigned Harrison Barnes in 2016 if they couldn't get KD. Barnes is just a better player than Wiggins. They would have used the cap space in 2016 no matter what lol.   It's kind of absurd how you are trying to give KD credit for the current Warriors lol, what is even the point of this."
dude they could have just resigned Harrison Barnes who is a better player than Wiggins. You really are not thinking this one through at all my guy.
Ben Simmons + Shake Milton = Pistons   Kelly Olynyk + Harrison Barnes + Saddiq Bey = 76ers  Jerami Grant = Kings
My argument is flawed but your commenting what if scenarios. The best free agent sfs that were looked at as better then Harrison Barnes that year is....Nicholas Batum.   No other star would of been bold to pull that off. Plus draymond called Kevin durant to come thru.  From what nba fans saw Lebron was projected to beat them in 2015. Was supposed to lose 2016 but beat them. Fool me once fool me twice you can't be  fooled a third time
"They would have resigned Harrison Barnes, that big ol star"
"1. Injuries and suspensions beat the warriors, thinking Curry and crew wouldn’t be back after that is laughable. Best record ever for a reason  2. KD made them unbeatable, but they were already an all time great team that was 100% winning again  3. Would still have Harrison Barnes if KD never came to GS, who is pretty much a wash with Wiggins"
"I mean who was on that 15-16 team, that’s not there now? Harrison Barnes? bogut? This team is way deeper imo."
"Two players I'd love to see traded are Jerami Grant and Harrison Barnes but I don't see Grant specifically getting traded.  I felt awful for Denver when he didn't resign, but apparently a huge thing for Grant is he wanted to play for a black coach/GM and be a huge advocate for black outreach in Detroit. He really wanted to be there and if Detroit trades them it'd gut their FA reputation (and they already don't get FAs anyways)"
"Alex Caruso,juan Tuscano Anderson,Patty Mills,Kyle Kuzma,Harrison Barnes"
"Replace LeBron with Harrison Barnes, and the Cavs are mediocre.  Replace Durant with Harrison Barnes, and they're one of the best teams of all-time.   That's the difference."
" Kings vs Suns, Harrison Barnes buzzer beater game winner was great"
"&gt; but I honestly think management and the Warriors players don't get enough credit for acquiring Duran  I mean, the only reason it was able to happen was because Steph was on that cheap contract he signed due to his early ankle injuries. They just got super lucky that he was so massively underpaid and KD became a free agent when he did. It's not like they planned that aspect of it.   However, the drafting of Steph and Klay and Draymond and Harrison Barnes, and the team- and culture-building that they accomplished is truly remarkable, for sure."
"You are right I would swap Randle with DeMar. Yeah it was Harrison Barnes (20/8/2), I was trying to think of a wing but Gobert is probably more likely"
"You forgot Demar. And Tatum and Randle haven’t been playing very well, but Tatum might make it due to his popularity.  Also, who’s Barnes? Harrison?"
But those rings with kd are worth nothing. Even one ring in thise 3 years would’ve been worth more. Also if they didn’t have Kd they likely have Harrison Barnes at least so they increase their chances of winning in 2019 and 2017. 2018 I agree they probably fall to Houston regarldsss but they easily could’ve won the other two years.
"&gt; Which non-playoff teams have players that the 76ers would accept for Simmons that would be reasonable in the eyes of the 76ers?  Harrison Barnes, D'Angelo Russell, Collin Sexton, Malcolm Brogdon, Fred VanVleet, Brandon Ingram, CJ McCollum, De'Aaron Fox, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander,"
People felt cheated because the Warriors/ Cavs rivalry was like the modern Lakers/Celtics. Steph &amp; Lebron were competing for the top spot and KD’s move ruined the balance of the league. Nobody was mad at him for leaving Russ because it’s hard to win a title with Russ as your PG. He plays too out of control and shows little poise during crunch time. People wanted KD to build his own team and challenge those guys (Steph &amp; Lebron). He could’ve teamed up with PG or Kawhi and everyone would’ve supported it because he wanted to challenge them. He joined a team that won a title with Harrison Barnes at their starting SF. Replace any championship team’s third option with KD and it becomes overkill. People knew they were winning before the season started and that’s not good for any league !
"Yes, Harrison Barnes absolutely makes your team dramatically better than Ben Simmons. This isn't hard, why are you even asking the question. Barnes is not a bad defender and defense is not even a problem for the 6ers. You guys need reliable scoring options to offload Embiid's workload, and Barnes gives a lot of spacing to help Embiid too. It's pretty obvious that Simmons killing the offense was way more impactful than defensive benefit."
its the epitome of overreacting to small sample sizes early in the season  one of those three losses was a miracle harrison barnes 3 pointer that probably goes in 1 out of 10 times
"True for Mavs fans, the opposites are the Luka stans. Bet that they won’t even survive the Harrison Barnes era."
"I went back and watched some playoffs/finals series lately and players were being allowed to absolutely maul Curry in some of those games. I don't put it on him when people are getting away with murder while he's been double teamed, and Harrison Barnes can't hit a wide open shot to save his mother."
"Yeah, I just don’t think the front office is in a rush to trade him. Pascal was a pretty good 3 pt shooter prior to his injury, when he wasn’t the number 1 option, and he was getting open looks from the corner. I think the team thinks he can get back to that type of efficiency, especially now that OG, FVV, GTJ are coming into their own offensively, and command respect in their own offensive creation. If Scottie can progress shooting wise, there’s lots of upside here. If there’s some amazing offer I’m sure Masai will listen, but I’m not sure there’s many players that meets what we’re looking for that are on the block. Harrison Barnes certainly isn’t the one to move the needle for us. It’s too early, with too many variables right now to truly gauge this current lineup."
"Because their skill sets are redundant and Barnes offers essentially the same thing Siakam does at a MUCH lower price. Imagine if they could flip Siakam for a versatile scoring wing who would actually provide some potent spacing instead of the league average shooter that Siakam is. With Barnes and OG Toronto would still have plenty of defensive switchability even without Siakam. I don't know who that player would be exactly, maybe somebody like a Harrison Barnes or someone similar.  I'm not saying Siakam isn't good, but I don't really see the long term fit between him Barnes. Not to mention injuries have been an issue for Siakam the past 2 years and that's not usually something that gets better for big men as they approach 30. The next 2 seasons he's due 35 and 37 million, which again not to say Siakam isn't a good player, but that's a bit of an overpay. I'm not saying he should definitely be traded, but if I'm Toronto I think it's at least worth kicking the tires on what he could fetch in a trade."
" If you really want context, add some context to how many rings Steph has (3) and how close he was to another 2 that honestly he had no control over losing. In 2016, that was the Harrison Barnes space cadet show, Bogut back, or the Draymond suspension. Curry despite narrative played fantastic. In 2019 3 starters down in the last week of playing.   If Steph curry makes more 483 3 point sots instead of 482 in 2016 they win **89 games** without KD and we aren't having this conversation about top 2-3 point guards but about top 2-3 players."
"Harrison Barnes has also gotten a lot better to be fair. Kings are pretty fun team right now with Buddy, Barnes, Fox, Haliburton &amp; Mitchell. I think they're gonna make the playoffs (hot take don't roast me)"
Haha I know… but god Nick nurse is a great coach and Kerr I’m glad doesn’t have an ego that he can’t sponge to learn… Kerr grew from the ty lue experience and from Nick nurse as well… it’s great to see gsw with a team that can actually execute the game plan…. Kelly had potential but unfortunately was too stuck in his ways… Wiggins is a revelation though as never expected him to blossom from a Harrison Barnes like player to being two way wiggins
To say Davis is the 14th most impactful player of all time when he plays isn't crazy. He is elite in every part of the game just made of glass. He's formally missed like 25% of all his games and I can't count the number of times a hobbled ass AD has trotted out there when he shouldn't. The guy is top 25 all time in ppg and has same career defensive rating as Jordan like he's not a top 5 guy of all time but he's a HOF lock and if he can get a bit healthier in back half of career I see no reason he can't end up top 15 all time. The stupid top 75 list had us comparing incomplete careers with cemented legacies I think it's ruined a lot of perspective on current greatness.  Like I said the stat definitely has limitations but I expected some Harrison Barnes/Steve Kerr scenarios where role players on good teams were disproportionately high on the list and that doesn't seem to be the case.
"Exactly, people below are acting like he wasn’t one game away from the NBA Finals with OKC, up 3-1 on the 73-9 Warriors, with Oladipo and Horford coming in the offseason while the Warriors were about to lose their depth players and be forced to max Harrison Barnes.     KD was on the verge of winning a title with OKC as the darling of the league.     Easily could’ve won the title the very next year."
*Harrison Barnes liked that.*
"Things will only get easier for him when Klay comes back. He's such a perfect fit with our  core, he's a better version of 2015 Harrison Barnes."
Way better than Harrison Barnes.
"Peeked at the lottery of the last dozen or so drafts and, of the guys not mentioned already, Harrison Barnes popped out. Big high school recruit. Expectations lowered a bit after college, but we’re still definitely there. Looks not great, then like a nice role player elevated by a great team, and now is becoming a dude that a lot of teams might target this trade deadline. Not a star, but has turned around from his first few years for sure"
"kings - harrison barnes  clippers - paul george  wolves - i don't even know why, kat, i guess?"
"He can, should, and will.  Western Frontcourt options are a little weaker on the top end because Kawhi and Zion will not be in contention. *Possible* that LeBron isn't, but I would assume he comes back soon and is a lock.  Nevermind Draymond's scoring and shooting numbers. He's playing DPOY-level defense for the best team in the NBA. If the latter holds up, or is close to holding up, I think he should be a lock to get voted in as a reserve by the Coaches.   Starter voting leads to 3 frontcourt starters. That should be between PG, Jokic, AD, and LeBron. With one not starting, then that leaves 2 out of 3 Coach votes that must be frontcourt players.   Out of those two remaining mandatory frontcourt slots, KAT deserves to get in. And then it's basically between Harrison Barnes and Draymond, maybe Bogdan Bogdanovic.  And there's still two ""wildcard"" slots for Coaches to vote for.   Draymond's making the All-Star team."
No disrespect but he's serving the Harrison Barnes role really well for this team and that's all this team needed pre-KD Era.
Magic shaq is quick asf. I think he would basically be a giannas or taller zion. The game changes base off generational players.   Shaq is one of the main reasons people started shooting jumpshots and not wanting to play center.   Defense just make him a on the best help defenders. Play a zone defense.   A modern day shaq team would be like.   Lonzo-  zach lavine - Robert covington-  Marcus Morris- Shaq   Ricky rubio- Paul George- Harrison Barnes- Bobby Portis- Shaq   Last Deaaron fox- Duncan Robinson- kawhi- joe ingles- Shaq
"The 2015 championship team and 2016 73 wins team was Steph, Dray, Klay, Iggy, Harrison Barnes and a solid bench.  This year's team has potential to beat them if Klay back and plays well."
"They have Wiggins, i know he is not KD but they won with Harrison Barnes too. They also have a bench deeper than ever. Even the young players are solid."
Harrison Barnes
I love Harrison Barnes.
"Are you getting hate responses in DM or something? Lol nobody even responded aggressively or anything  To answer though yeah we have more talent this year than we have in a while, probably since we have cousins/gay/rondo  Fox (bad season so far), flamethrowa Buddy hield, advanced stat darling Richaun Holmes, smooth and steady Harrison Barnes, future inside the nba member Tyrese Haliburton, thicc boi Davion Mitchell, and seen flashes of talent from bench pieces like Terence Davis or Len  Nothing that’s gonna blow you away or anything but a couple potential All-stars on there, and some depth. Not on the Hawks level yeah but definitely better than the pelicans or the thunder"
"Jesus fucking Christ, there's no way you said this with a straight face. We may not have lived through Jordan's era, but I sure lived through the Curry Warriors era and Curry is by far the most important player of the Warriors, the entire system do not work as well without Curry. People were sagging off guys like Draymond/Harrison Barnes to double/triple team Curry.  Like the other guy said, there's levels to this.  P.S. I know I am 2 days late but this is just a terrible take. Draymond is a valuable part of the Warriors dynasty, almost irreplaceable, like a Scottie Pippen, but he does not nearly have the same impact as Steph fucking Curry. Not even close. Please don't take this the wrong way, this doesn't mean that they're not valuable to the team, it's just that Steph Curry is Steph ""skyfucker"" Curry. That's it."
"I mean...I'm not pissed about it anymore lol Kerr is clearly superior in every way but at the time I was not a fan of the move.   And Jackson's treatment of Festus was relatively low on his list of problems. I'm a little more worried about him saying Harrison Barnes was possessed by a demon, trying to heal Steph's ankle with holy water, and just not getting along with anyone in the organization."
"Cole Anthony?  Also he won't win, but Harrison Barnes is randomly having a career best season in almost every stat category."
Houston and Harden never won it all. If Steph Curry wanted to keep Harrison Barnes instead of go after KD in whatever year that offseason was then I think that’d be worth it too. Maybe I’m overestimating how much autonomy over basketball ops a franchise player that wins a ring should have but that’s just the way I see it.
Harrison Barnes is cooking too. Best player on the Kings is a Warrior.
Its all about expectations. No one uses their #1 pick wanting a solid role player. You want a bonafide 1st or 2nd option. Franchise players.  So yeah hes a bust. Rn hes playing role the role Harrison barnes had back in the day yet no one calls Harrison barnes a bust since he was the #7 pick. No shame in being a solid starter though thats still really hard
"Because it ignores context. You are literally reading a stat sheet 30 years after the fact and pointing at shooting percentages.      He was also leading the team in assists during the time and drawing a lot of defensive attention. He wasn't Harrison Barnes out there.      Also his defense matters because it is half the game. You replace Scottie with virtually anybody and the defense is significantly worse. The defense the Bulls played was a huge part of why they were so good, and you can easily point to Scottie being as responsible for that as Jordan if not more so. Again, offensively, Scottie played a massive role for the Bulls. Without him on the court, way more defensive focus for Jordan, and/or somebody who can't capitalize on the extra attention Jordan got by moving the ball.      If you watch those games back and don't think Pippen was a huge part of them winning championships, you need to stop talking about basketball, because that's nonsense."

That’s how you end up with another Harrison Barnes situation in the playoffs.
"This is how I used to describe Harrison Barnes. Good guy. Says the right things. But the most average on court. Which isn't a bad thing. Just don't put super high expectations.   He started hot this season, but it'll leave out to regular Harrison Barnes once again"
Wiggins is legit ass. I wanna love the guy but he’s just not gonna cut it for us in the playoffs. Worse than Harrison Barnes was
"While a fair statement, cap space can still be used more efficiently than they did. Instead of Crabbe/Evan Turner who kind of overlapped with Dame/Lillard they could've gone after a Harrison Barnes.   I just felt they targeted the wrong free agents."
Andrew Wiggins - Harrison Barnes   Harrison Barnes - Andre Wiggins   Solid enough...
Trade Simmons for Harrison Barnes and Marvin Bagley and go all in with Tryese Maxy
Can’t believe Harrison Barnes is still being disrespected like that.
Harrison Barnes is having a All-Star caliber season. If he keeps it up that could be great trade too. Maybe somehow you can finesse both Barnes and Hield. Would take a call from the Kings to rebuild but it’s possible.
"Harrison Barnes is also a net negative by all those stats. So according to you, the Warriors somehow had a top defense while playing 3 net negative defenders in Steph, Klay, and Barnes?"
Harrison Barnes has been in the league for like 9 years now
Harrison Barnes isn't a rookie anymore. I'd probably go with Green for the 3rd spot
"&gt;The problem is that the team is WILDLY inconsistent.  And that can be attributed to talent   This isn't unique....same thing happened last season. Kings would go on a 8 game losing streak then win 11 of 12. Same coach during the losing and winning streaks. The thing about the B-C tier players is they can be good for 40-50 games a year. A tier players like KD, Giannis, Jokic etc will be good 65-75 games a year...they are the difference between being wildly inconsistent and being a good team. Kings right now have a lot of C tier talent that on a good night/week will look like a sure fire playoff team and on bad nights will look like a lottery team. They got off to a good start but my question was what happens when Harrison Barnes shooting regresses to the baseline? How do they win when their players aren't wildly outperforming expectations?  I'm not saying Luke is a great coach but I would like to see criticism of his coaching layered with examples of x and o tactics he is getting wrong...rather than blaming him for losing streaks and attributing the winning streaks to the players"
Love how you left harrison barnes out lol
*Harrison Barnes
"I don't think aibwykat's comment was a straw man, though it may have been unclear.  Are the Kings' parts truly even a good product? Up until the last couple of drafts, they were really only riding on Fox, Harrison Barnes, and Buddy. They've had Richaun Holmes, Bjelica, and Bogdan Bogdanovic. They finally hit with Tyrese Haliburton and now Davion Mitchell. But tell me how a roster with those players as the core is supposed to keep up with the other Western juggernauts. Their incredibly lackluster drafting for more than a decade now (with pretty much only Fox and Cousins as hits) and their mishandling of draft assets (see the Stauskas trade) are out of Walton's hands. The best coaches in the NBA may have dragged these rosters to a low playoff seed a few times but they've been devoid of talent for a while.  That said, I agree that Luke should have been fired long ago."
You want to see Harrison Barnes in the dunk contest again? Let’s leave the power dunkers out
not good game for Harrison Barnes MVP campaign  sad :(
"Yes but last year was like ""let everybody shoot not named steph"" and the last 3 month stretch was just unprecedented. Unlike in 2016 where they have harrison barnes and klay as a gravity too."
"Warriors had top ranked defenses pre-KD and great bigs in Bogut and DLee as well as a budding Draymond. Add to that a very deep bench and athletic wings in Igg and Harrison Barnes, while guard-centered, they ran a lot of pick and rolls and interesting actions off ball, so not just chucking threes."
"you're asking for quiet. So outside of fantasy basketball, where it's a little more know, these are the guys responsive to the question:  bobby portis mo bamba gary trent jr. John Collins Dejounte Harris Tyrese Haliburton Wendell Carter Jr Grayson Allen cole anthony richaun holmes tyrese maxey  Not listing mobley, scottie barnes, harrison barnes, miles bridges, carmelo, and some others since they've definitely been talked about a lot."
Mark Jackson may have recognized Steph Curry's talent but he didn't maximize it the way Steve Kerr did. They were still running odd stuff like Klay post-ups or Harrison Barnes isos under Jackson.
"RJ Barrett, who I just imagine is in the Harrison Barnes and Andrew Wiggins mold."
Harrison Barnes
"The Blazers don't have a championship ceiling, but I think the one thing they can do is trade CJ for an actual small forward. Probably Harrison Barnes.  A lineup of Dame / Norm / Barnes / RoCo / Nurk is pretty nasty and you're moving away from an undersized backcourt. There may be issues with a lack of a secondary ball-handler, but I think between Barnes and Nurk you can try to cover that up.   The Blazers don't have the assets to swing for a star, but as we've seen time and time again Dame values loyalty and the Blazers owe it to themselves to create the best cast they can around him. Will that be a championship contender? Probably not, but I still think that's a risk worth taking for reasons I mentioned above.  (also if they wanted to blow it up, Harrison Barnes is a lot easier to trade than CJ)"
For third place I would like to nominate Harrison Barnes
They thought Wiggins would be their new Harrison Barnes.
For anyone wondering how bad he’s been: think of a worse version of 2016 Harrison Barnes
Nah Harrison Barnes ruined this rivalry

"This whole bullshit with Celtics fans and ""not moving the needle"" is stupid as hell. The alternative is watching Ainge sit on his ass and waste a bunch of draft picks like he's done within the past few years. There's nothing wrong with trying to make your team better and Harrison Barnes would be a solid fit next to the Jays.  Also you've made the comment about the hard cap - I doubt you'd be able to pay Collins the money that he wants and there's no other All-Stars available. Beal's not going anywhere and there's other teams that can outbid a TPE, lottery picks that turned into meh players and a few late firsts."
I swear to God if Ainge can flip Romeo Langford and a first for Harrison Barnes I'm gonna have an aneurism.
Maybe but that feels like way too much for Harrison Barnes
"I would be looking Bjelica and maybe Buddy. Buddy and Seth Curry on defense would be a mess, though. I would love to get Harrison Barnes, but there's too much overlap with Tobias.    OK, so just Bjelica."
"At a certain point though, you need to actually keep good veterans on the team so they can help prospects develop and have the team build a winning culture.  Is Harrison Barnes a good veteran presence? That might be worth more than a late first rounder or an early second rounder."
"Yikes, they demented themselves into thinking they were getting a CP3 level player and now they’re looking at Harrison Barnes. Celtics really liked setting up a good future forecast rather than actually setting up a good situation. Kind of like stocks, all about future growth projections but then as soon as results actually come in the stock collapses."
"why do journalists structure sentences like this?  ""Now that the Kings have shifted to seller mode, The Celtics are looking to acquire Harrison Barnes with their $28.5m Hayward trade exception.""  What is wrong with that??"
Wouldn't it be crazy if he got fired at the half like when Harrison Barnes got traded mid game.
I would be careful about giving up this much for Barnes   Weighing the most recent 35 game sample size of a guys career over his entire career is the type of thing bad franchises do when making trades   I also don’t think Barnes can be an actual small ball 5 which would help Boston. His improved playmaking is cool but he’s not keeping up 63% TS his defense is Jaylen brown esque switchable guy who looks the part but gets overrated because his on ball defense is a lot better than off ball.  He’s fine....but he’s also the classic prototype of a player who through the totality of his career the idea of Harrison Barnes is better than the reality of him. I would just be very careful this is easily the type of move that a year from now people can look back on and be like “wait what did they do”
"Team actually has a former #1 pick in Wiggins, a #2 pick in Wiseman and a potential high lottery pick from Minnesota in the 2021 draft. It's still a pretty stacked team.     Lost Harrison Barnes only to gain KD. Could've lost KD for nothing, but gained D'Lo instead and flipped him into Wiggins, and then acquired Oubre for picks.  Plus the core of Steph, Klay and Draymond will be back in force next season. Turn Oubre's expiring contract into another solid piece or savvy veterans to fill the Iguodala/Livingston void."
"Harrison ""keep getting dem checks"" Barnes. I really wouldn't mind having his career"
"Some fair points. I have never played 2k though. And it's not about signing a better player with Barnes money, although that is certainly possible. It's about flexibility. Let's say SAC wants to trade for Vucevic. Which package do you think Orlando would prefer:   A) Barnes, 1st (lotto protected SAC), a 4MM TPE, and no cap space   B) Three 1st's (2 BOS, 1 lotto protected SAC), Nesmith, a 20MM TPE, and 15MM in cap space.   Keep in mind they're in the position SAC is with little to no chance to win during the remainder of Barnes' contract. It won't happen every time, but I'd say a quality GM will do as well with 15MM in cap space as getting Barnes on 2/40, and we're left with a bunch of assets and flexibility to improve. This is looking at using the cap in just one way, too. What if someone wants to pay you to clear room? TJ Warren and #32 were traded for cash considerations (in real life, not 2k). In my opinion TJ Warren is a better basketball player, on a better contract, than Barnes. De'Anthony Melton and two 2nd's were traded to dump Josh Jackson's salary. Melton recently re-signed for 4/35. I'd rather have Melton at 4/35 than Barnes at 2/40. These opportunities pop up all the time, but you have to be in a position to take them. Let people match on the Crabbe's. Not every move is via RFA. Jerami just went for 3/60 and is better than Barnes. Christian Wood 3/41 via cheap S&amp;T. Jae Crowder 3/30. Sure, I'd rather have Jae + 10 million in cap than Barnes in many situations.      PHI: bottomed out and drafted Embiid, Simmons, used assets and cap flexibility (poorly) in deal for Tobias      LAL: had the cap flexibility to sign LeBron, used cap flexibility and assets from bottoming out to trade for AD      LAC: had the cap flexibility to sign Kawhi, cap/asset flexibility to trade for PG13 (including two MIA 1st's)      BKN: cap flexibility to sign Kyrie/KD, capitalized on Harden deal with assets      UTA: drafted Gobert, Mitchell (via trade), utilized cap space &amp; assets to trade for Conley      These are probably 5 of the top 6 or 7 title contenders this year, and every single one used significant cap flexibility to get where they are. If SAC is actually offered these type of assets for Barnes, who provides no surplus value and limits flexibility, yes I believe keeping him is ridiculous. As it relates to this hypothetical offer, keeping him over two 1st's, Nesmith, a 16MM TPE, and going from ~20MM to ~40MM in cap space would be egregious. Just this past off-season you could've traded one of those BOS 1st's and absorbed Oubre into your TPE. Do that after you spend your 40MM in cap and you've gone from Barnes +20MM in cap to Oubre, however you spent your 40MM in cap, Nesmith, 1st. Someone please tell me how SAC goes from where they are now, to championship contenders, while turning down deals like this. At what point will they get more for Harrison Barnes?"
go get Harrison Barnes and Festus Ez.

"It might get deleted since the Athletic will reach out to the mods if an article is copy/pasted, but here’s just the lists without the blurb included:  - Wizards: KAT - Celtics: Zach LaVine - Warriors/Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram - Heat: De’Aaron Fox - Hawks: LaMelo - Knicks: Lowry - Lakers: Siakam - Blazers: Jerami Grant - Mavs: Vucevic - Bucks: Fred VanVleet - Clippers: DeRozan - Nuggets: Terry Rozier - Nets: Harrison Barnes - Sixers: D’Angelo Russell - Suns: Christian Wood - Jazz: Collin Sexton"
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."
"It's pretty ugly.  Of the past 100 top 10 draft picks ( 2009-2019 draftees ), the only 5 to even reach the Finals with their draft team are: Harrison Barnes, Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, James Harden, and Stephen Curry. And two of those wouldn't have made it without a certain free-agent acquisition.  So while building a winner high in the draft is a nice idea, its recent track record is bleak, at best.  The preceding decade was just a little better, with 8 out of 100: James, Westbrook, Durant, Bynum, Howard, Wade, Kenyon Martin, and Paul Pierce.  Of those 13 players, only 6 were top 3 picks and just 4 were first overall -- over 20 years."
"George was worse than Kawhi of course. You are missing my point. One narrative distracts from the other. Kawhi's performance in two huge games went under the radar because people were having so much fun making fun of PG.  Harrison Barnes choked a lot harder than Curry in the 2016 finals but that didn't stop Curry from getting criticized. Blake Griffin was awful in the clippers collapse against the Rockets and yet CP3 got a ton of shit even though he played well. Superstars are held to a higher standard but Kawhi kinda slips through the cracks sometimes because he's doesn't have a public personality people resonate with.  I'm not even anti-kawhi im just noting something odd that happens with the media and with NBA fans. Seriously think about the shit people say when LeBron, Harden, Curry, Giannis come up short."
"First, iggy in 2016 was still playing at an elite level, Wiggins is playing the Harrison Barnes role (at a higher level) more than anything.  Second, the entire team around them is different, Klay alone doesn’t make them the best team in the league. It was their insane depth that put them over the top."
"I remember 2016 harrison Barnes, GSW fans had no chill either and Barnes is like the nicest guy ever.      Every fanbase has their % of shitty fans, now the more Total amount of fans you got, the more dicks you got as well, even though I swear 75% of Philly is complete assholes."
the disrespect for kings legend harrison barnes
Man you could replace Harrison Barnes in the '16 Finals with almost any Warriors player that played tonight and the Warriors probably win  I love the Black Falcon but damn I just can't think of him without thinking of that terrible offensive performance
He could've said a former player who was only with Curry for a few years and it wouldn't have felt so disrespectful - like Harrison Barnes?
He's looking like Harrison Barnes ~2016
all demar needed to do was just be a little below average...not harrison barnes
"He’s a guy that raises the floor as a number 1 option but raises the ceiling as a number 3. Their games are different, but he reminds me of Harrison Barnes in that way."
"i think you overly focus on toughness instead of basketball here and romantize it too much in a ""who wants it more"" way  2004 is not that surprising in retrospective when you realize post sheed trade pistons were the best defense of the 3 point era, a triumph generstional defense over ""merely"" really great offense  2016 is related to a lot of basketball factors, like lebron being the best player on the court, curry being slowed down when offenses sell out to contain him and cavs tsking advantage of warriors non shooters or worse performing players like harrison barnes (who often was left open to guard curry and couldnt make cavs pay)  2011 is the closest to a toughnesd victory but is more so related to lebron adopting too much of a passive role to not get in wade way, and the lack of shooting to beat mavs zone and paint crowding (same issue that sunk usa vs argentina in 2004)  playing bosh as a midrange spot up, lebron off ball in the perineter, and another big alongside bosh was very unoptimal.   this changed when almost accidentally bosh had to become a center, wade took the secondary role, battier came to play a stretch 4 role and suddenly lebron had both the ball in his hands more and more space to work"
You have other choices to fill out the bench!  Gilbert Arenas - Agent Zero  Steven Adams - Aquaman  Dwyane Wade - Flash  Scottie Pippen - Robin  Andre Miller - The Professor  Harrison Barnes - Black Falcon  A.C. Green - Iron Man  Darius Miles - The Punisher  Xavier McDaniel - X-Man
"Comparing the pre-KD Warriors, this is a team with a number one draft pick in Wiseman.  Yes, Bogut was much better and Klay is injured. They have Wiggins and Oubre to fill the Klay and Harrison Barnes void.   Obviously, nobody can replace the savvy veteran play of Iguodala, Livingston and Barbosa. Bazemore and Wanamaker aren't nowhere near close."
"I don’t see how Draymonds suspension has anything to do with the wins record. If anything, it comes down to Harrison Barnes absolutely disappearing when we only needed maybe 2 shots out of him"
"this is how he speaks in a formal setting  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnJe3MciD4s  super similar to harrison barnes, it's fucking crazy."
"Harrison Barnes isn’t cutting his hair or shaving until the Kings hit .500 or the season ends. He made the vow in mid-December and looks pretty rugged these days. 7:46 AM · Feb 13, 2020"
"If steph doesn't get a bunch of bogus foul calls then he wouldn't have to sit early in the 1st and cavs wouldn't have a bunch of free points from free throws they didn't deserve. I'm not being salty, Lebron and Kyrie played amazing and dubs didn't in key moments in the series especially game 7, but the series probably doesn't go to game 7 without some clearly dodgy refereeing and the bogus draymond suspension.  The only thing from that series that I'm actually salty about is Harrison barnes being genuine trash for the back end of the series. If he shoots even remotely close to his normal numbers on wide open shots then the series would've been ours easy."
"&gt; TRob over Dame, Harrison Barnes, Terrence Ross, Andre Drummond, Austin Rivers, Meyes Leonard, Jeremy Lamb      Literally any of those players would have been better. And I'm not even talking about the post-lottery picks like Draymond, Middleton. Look at the rest of the 2012 draft, there are literally a dozen players outside of the lottery that were probably better."
"In that way he really is Harrison Barnes 2.0, cuz HB had a nice jump shot and was athletic and strong af, but every time that man put the ball on the floor it was nerve-wracking."
"To be fair Harrison Barnes played very well for the Warriors. He helped them win 1 championship and was part of the 73 win team. Warriors didnt extend him because of course you take KD over anyone. And similar to Wiggins, Barnes plays best not as a #1 option which he tried to do in Sac for too many years."

"Whaaaaat?! They are not that good. They don't have a superstar players or a solid core of veterans like the Knicks. I like Harrison Barnes and I wish him all the best, but he's not the sort of guy who anchors a 45 win team in this year's west.  The Kings ended up right where I expected them to be. Maybe a top 2 coach gets them to 42 with a few lucky bounces, but we can't knock Luke for that."
I will *never* forgive Harrison Barnes.
The projection for him was always that of a better Harrison Barnes
Wiggins reminds me of the Harrison Barnes role in 2015-16. But Wiggins obv much better
"Steph because he actually led his team to a championship as the best player on the team before Durant teamed up with him. The point of the game is to win championships so I give him credit for that. Warriors were incredible without KD, and any upgrade from Harrison Barnes at the SF position would have been enough to catapult their position against the Cavs.     KD is an all time great no doubt, unblockable sniper blah blah, I agree, I think the context of their careers favors Curry though. Let's not forget that Curry's shooting literally revolutionized how the entire game is played."
"Let’s wait until playoffs lol, Harrison Barnes was essentially this for them in 16."
"I think Jrue is proof that Jonathan Isaac’s excuse of not getting involved with social justice because of religion doesn’t hold weight. Holiday, as well as Harrison Barnes, are the two most Christian NBA players and their faith is why they actively want to make the world a better place."
"Especially when it was either that or overpay Harrison Barnes. Like, come on that's a no brainer decision. Not that I dislike Barnes, wish the Senator all the best, but you just don't say no to that."
Harrison Barnes was solid in 2016.  He was just hot garbage in the last three finals games.
Harrison Barnes that high surprised me  Sabonis being that high for defensive distance not such a good thing
"His best year by far, huge improvement on defense.  But he's still basically Mavericks Harrison Barnes on a max contract.  [Not worth a max..](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/neffm6/andrew_wiggins_had_career_highs_in_field_goal/gyfuurz/)"
He's everything they wanted Harrison Barnes to be.
He is what Warriors ‘16 wish Harrison Barnes was.
He’s about an average starter at this point. Kind of like Harrison Barnes when he was on the warriors. Better scorer but less versatile on defense
"Ugh, Steph and Harrison Barnes running isos all game gives me the bad flashbacks."
"de'aaron fox, tyrese haliburton, buddy hield, harrison barnes, and richaun holmes should really be enough to get it done within the next five years imo  funny thing is their roster seems better than their record, like bagley isn't trash and he comes off the bench, they've got delon wright and terence davis hanging around there too, you can do much worse than fox for your superstar and the supporting cast are above-average starters. It just all goes awry for them every time because 1) terrible fo 2) bad coaching 3) it's the kings"
"But in this market I think he gets more than 20 mill, even Harrison Barnes got a contract for like 22 mill recently."
I think they get rid of Oubre not Wiggins. Bazemore and JTA are more than serviceable replacements. Or they go out and get another scoring forward like Harrison Barnes.
"I don't know. I think you'd need a good starting small forward, someone at least as good as Harrison Barnes. Probably a pretty good bench with scoring and versatility and at least one good consistent starting center to hold down the paint. Ideally the center has played with Curry for a few years and knows how to get it to Curry when they need to.  *With this years Warriors... I just don't see it.*"
Past roleplayer by now. He's been a good starter and I think he'll be awesome in the Harrison Barnes type role because we'll get a lot of his value by default but he's shown he can step up too.
"One of the worst parts about KD leaving OKC to join the Warriors is that after 2016 they were going to lose Barbosa, Ezeli and Speights, and were going to be forced to give Harrison Barnes the max.     Their depth was going to be significantly worse, while OKC had picked up Oladipo and Sabonis, and were on the verge of picking up Horford, meaning their depth was going to be significantly better.     If KD just stayed in OKC, he likely still wins an NBA title in 2017, but he does it on his own team and defeats the Warriors, getting revenge for 2016.     He would've been absolutely beloved by the media and NBA fans around the world for taking down the Warriors.     He really fucked up his own legacy by taking the easy way out."
Man said Harrison Barnes was playing bad because he was possessed by a demon. And he had his assistant spy on the team for him.
"No you werent better than healthy golden state, and no you werent playing Harrison Barnes, Bogut and them boys so chill on that"
"Why would I be mad at a team for beating us fairly? They had better role players on the 73 win team like Harrison Barnes, and didnt Klay get injured in game 5 while he was cooking? Your team was really good, the defense was insane, so yeah they still had to beat a good team but GSW wouldve won with KD and Klay healthy all series in my opinion"

"To be fair, it worked on Harrison Barnes 😭"
Didn’t Cuban trade Harrison Barnes mid game one year?
We’re pretending that Harrison Barnes doesn’t exist?
Having Simmons for 80% of the game is better than not having Simmons. You can't convince me otherwise. You just need an experienced closer off the bench. There's a reason Iguodala came off the bench for Harrison Barnes.  Simmons is still a great player. Just because he's not _as great_ as you want him to be or expected him to be doesn't mean hes trash.
"Don is fine against guards but he and Royce are too small to guard proper wings. Kawhi, PG, and Marcus bodied them or shot over them the whole series, and I'm sure they have trouble defending guys like Harrison Barnes and others with his body type and skillset too. I know how the Jazz scheme is supposed to work but the way the roster is set up they literally cannot contend with a good small lineup, which tends to only matter against a few teams every year. There's a reason we were happy to fall to the 4th seed instead of staying in 3rd though, and anyone who watched our last regular season matchup vs you guys would know that."
The only rings in NBA history where you could replace the best player with Harrison Barnes and get the same result
The gameplan of forcing Harrison Barnes to beat them by giving him good looks proved to be great.
&gt; Harrison Barnes (and salary filler/picks) for Gobert?  lmao
"Good team? They won the finals, set the nba regular season win record and then literally replaced Harrison Barnes for Kevin Durant"
mark still in the world where the warriors offense needs to run through harrison barnes
"&gt; Luka Doncic is r/NBA’s golden boy. He can do no wrong. He takes 7 inefficient step-back threes a game, stat pads triple doubles, shoots tons of free throws and yells about foul calls. To r/NBA this makes him “a stud” and “built different.” They love him unconditionally. Meanwhile, James Harden plays this same style of basketball. Everything I just said to describe Luka’s play could be said about Harden equally. They must love him too, then… right? If you’re familiar with nbacirclejerk (which I assume you are if you’re reading this) then you might have an idea of what’s coming here. In my research I found a few recent (within the year) instances of r/NBA users claiming the Rockets could only beat teams using the refs. Going further back into the sub, there’s lots of people in game threads, post game threads, etc. calling Harden a “flopper” a “chucker” a “bitch” and a “choker.” I even found two comments that said “I hate [Harden] as a person.” (It’s odd to me how r/NBA seems to assume they know players on a personal level, but that’s a topic I’ve covered in previous posts.) Harden clearly gets different treatment from r/NBA than Doncic, despite the two of them playing eerily similar ways, and acting relatively the same in regards to foul calls. So what’s different between the two of them to cause this? Is it the team they play for? The Rockets don’t seem to be particularly well liked, but the Mavericks do recently. So that’s it, problem solved right? No. As one person in r/NBA puts it, “the Mavs didn’t have this many fans when Harrison Barnes was their best player.” r/NBA doesn’t have any deep spiritual connection with the Mavericks that causes them to love all their players. So why is Doncic so loved and Harden so hated? **Well, to be quite frank, Doncic is white**. It has to be said that r/NBA loves white players.  [TL;DR in meme format](https://i.redd.it/yw1eh6vyfmx51.jpg)"
"The Mavs FO was sub-mediocre long time before Luka.  They almost wasted all of Dirk's career before putting a decent supporting cast around him, which resulted in an instant win. Dirk's weaknesses, obvious to anyone watching ball, were defense, rebounding and playmaking. He was an absolute elite scorer, but there were holes that needed to be plugged. I was saying Dirk needs someone like Chandler next to him since 2005 or 2006. I specifically mentioned Chandler. And for playmakers, it'd be hard to do better than Kidd, even an older Kidd.   Let's not forget that in order to help cover Dirk's poor D, the Mavs also got Shawn Marion and DeShawn ""I can't feel my face"" Stevenson.  That was the one and only well assembled Mavs roster in over 20 years. The only one where the pieces fit.   All the other moves (done or attempted) by the Mavs over that period were major flops:  * Dampier was a disaster, and they have up Nash for him * the attempted pairing of Dwight and Deron would have flamed out, considering how they fell off, especially Deron * DeAndre Jordan would have been a massively overpaid role player unable to fill in the same role as Chandler * speaking of Chandler, Chandler Parsons * Rondo - the move didn't make sense to me at the time, and it went even worse than I expected. I would have kept Crowder * Harrison Barnes  They also kept Avery Johnson as coach for way too long. Dude was clearly a poor coach.  **It's irrelevant how much of a diva/hothead Luka is, the Mavs FO underperformed for over 2 decades and should have been replaced long ago.**"
"They also get to go against Joe Harris who is doing his best 2016 Harrison Barnes impression. So yes, it would be a disaster if the Bucks blow this"
"Harrison Barnes. He had more ""oomph"" to his game especially with his finishing prior to back to back injuries in golden state. He was destroying people, how quickly folks forget his posters on [pekovic](https://youtu.be/vheaw76ZClw) or that [double clutch ](https://youtu.be/mMlL7nk9Lto) vs blazers."
"I’ve never seen a player who made as much as he did in his career even care about being a gm. They make peanuts compared to what he made. I can’t think of one player who was at his pay scale that even cared about assuming control. He’s solidified as like a player you know. Jerry west, Danny ainge, dumars, Larry bird, and James Jones combined didn’t make as much as him. Always was a very like able player. If he wanted to make a power grab he would’ve done it when don nelson gave Harrison Barnes a Big contract ruining dirks twilight. Why wait until now?"
Harrison Barnes said that's his favorite movie.
"OG, Jerami Grant, MPJ, Mikal, Wiggins, Bojan, Joe Harris, Harrison Barnes"
"Portland does this in a heartbeat, 76ers probably hang up the phone.  The issue with getting rid of Ben is you don't have another big wing to guard an opponent's best player.  I think the best way to get rid of CJ is to trade him for two FRPs and then throw those + other assets at either Harrison Barnes or Jerami Grant."
"Dsj, harrison barnes, and nerlens noel"
"Here comes the KD fanboyism that got you in your feelings. I never said Curry was a better player. I simply stated that its pretty easy for a player to win FMVP when you have draymond anchoring the defense, and the gravity Klay and Curry provides which makes teams have to play KD single coverage. Yes i AGREE HES IN HIS OWN TIER, that's why its a fucking diss to him because he didn't have to carry the load that lebron did with his teams as he always saw double to triple teams, setting players up and attacking the paint. Things KD didnt have to do to win in GSW. KD had it easy to win FMVP. Case closed, take off your fanboy glasses. You basically have a former MVP playing a harrison barnes role."
"IM REACHING HARD? maybe you are just a KD Fanboy. Barnes isn't good at attacking single coverage and didn't hit threes when it mattered most when Curry and Klay commanded the defensive attention. ADDING A FORMER MVP PLAYING A HARRISON BARNES ROLE IS REACHING HARD? cmon bro, how about you get outta here with ur logic? CURRY IS GUARDABLE? dawg have you seen his gravity and his off-ball movement? he commands more than one man attention plain and simple. Your basketball knowledge lacking here."
"Lmfao by your logic, Harrison Barnes should’ve been able to do that. You’re reaching haaarrrddd.   Teams focus on guarding Curry because he’s actually GUARDABLE. You absolutely cannot stop KD, you just let him get his and take away everybody else"
"if they were good they wouldn't have been able to draft klay at #11 in 2011.  i guess they probably could still have gotten dray since he was #35 in 2012, but they had 4 picks that year and also got harrison barnes at #7, and I'm not sure which were their own pick and which were from elsewhere."
shamet provides spacing. replace joe harris w him. i don’t think you understand how bad he’s been. remember 2016 finals harrison barnes? he’s been that level of pure garbage and it’s even worse because we’re injured and desperately need production from him.

Can it be like the Harrison Barnes trade?   He's fired at halftime and Rick Carlisle steps in?
" Mark Cuban,  his popularity, big mouth and “influence” have limits. NBA free agency has exposed Cube’s sphere of power.  He can’t make the Mavericks the Los Angeles Lakers, or the city of Dallas and it’s sprawling community South Beach. He thought he could, and he can’t.  Since the NBA dramatically changed its free agency rules after the Mavs won the 2011 title, players change teams like they do girlfriends.  Cuban’s plan was to use his influence, charm and cash to sign those bigger names to sustain the Mavs as an NBA contender. We are now in our 10th year of NBA free agency fun, and the top unrestricted free agent the Mavs have signed is Harrison Barnes, or Wes Matthews."
"This is by far the most worried I’ve been about this franchise, even more so than when our “young core” was DSJ, Harrison Barnes and probably Mo Bamba. My head is spinning rn"
"The start of the Golden State dynasty was all home-grown and savvy moves. Draft Curry, Thompson, Green, Harrison Barnes, keep Curry instead of Ellis.  Our championship, admittedly a huge anomaly with the whole Golden State team getting injured in the Finals, also home grown.  Before that, you had the Spurs, Mavericks, and Pistons winning titles without them being free agent assembled superteams.  Maybe the player empowerment era has made these kinds of teams impossible, I don't know, I don't think that's the case but we'll see. I'll root for Phoenix, Utah, Atlanta and Milwaukee then, mostly teams that built steadily through the draft, savvy trades, player development."
"Man I watched Steph Curry get benched for Acie Law, I watched Harrison Barnes iso like 100 times under Mark Jackson, and I saw us get bounced for a few years while we figured it out. Of course it was disappointing, but at no point was it even reasonable to think that Steph should just bounce cause we hadn’t won a title. And btw that’s why OG Warriors fans will ride or die for him.   Unless you somehow convince a top 5 NBA player to come to your team in free agency, you cannot win a championship even with a number 1 pick for at least 5 years.   This league is done for if a player whose barely played a season worth of games can force an exit. Sports run on long term fan loyalty."
Harrison Barnes. Anything involving storylines in the dunk contest is wack and deserves all the hate and scrutiny it gets. The NBA tried to get cute and the results were almost always super cringey (shout out to Chase Budinger's super awkward White Men Can't Jump skit).
"People really under rate what Wiggins is going to be for this team. Yes. He's NOT a star. But neither was Harrison Barnes. And we won 73 games with that guy as a starter. What people don't like about him now, will be an asset when Klay comes back. We don't need a 3rd star. We need a great role player. And Wiggins should be that guy."
"You're probably right. Personally, I'd love to see them flip their contracts and picks to a team ready to rebuild and get some players that complement him. He's so good, he's sped up their timeline.  I doubt they could land Beal, but Bledsoe/Adams/Picks for Brogdon/Turner or Brogdon/Sabonis could be great. I'm sure DET would send Jerami Grant for the right price. Toronto might part with VanVleet or Siakam if Lowry bolts. They might be able to get Harrison Barnes, Sexton, Kemba, or Christian Wood. Lots of options, IMHO, just need to be willing to part with picks."
"&gt; His jumper looks amazing, it doesn’t really go in, but it’s beautiful.  That's been his issue since duke lol. The guy looks like a good basketball player, has all the tools to be a good basketball player, but isn't yet. Reminds me of how I felt about Harrison Barnes. I always asked why is this guy not better than he is? He's turned into a solid player but I thought he'd be a star. Hopefully Cam figures it out."
"On Paul George, it doesn't have to be him it just becomes a game of ""who is better than Harrison Barnes and worse than Kevin Durant"". It didn't even have to be a star it just had to be an upgrade.  I get what you mean though I enjoyed watching the team a lot more without KD though I appreciated the beauty in utter dominance."
"That’s interesting, yeah I’m not from Cali so maybe what I’m saying is a more popular sentiment than I thought. The “wild” part to answer the question is just giving up the rings no matter what in hopes we might win another with no guarantee if it means no KD. But again maybe other Warriors fan agree with this too.   I’d take Harrison Barnes over KD. I just hate everything about KD joining and what it did to that group’s legacy. And taking away from Steph being the number 1 option and Klay the number 2. And I don’t like watching Durant play either even tho I respect how incredible he is.  PG13 Id still feel kind of mixed about to be honest haha. I just don’t like the idea of another big star joining the 73 win team that Steph/Klay/Dray/Iggy/everyone else made. I just wanted to see Curry and Klay just go nuts trying to pull it all off themselves."
I have never thought we needed KD to win a ring and I think 2019 sort of proved that. We were a few steps away from winning in 2016...and everyone knows what happened in 2019.  What we did need was an upgrade over Harrison Can't Hit a Shot Barnes. And the only one really available was a generational talent. I think if we had like Paul George or something we win the same amount of rings.  Did I dislike KD joining? I was mixed on it I mean I was happy we got a big FA win right after the 2016 heartbreak. But becoming the bad guys of the NBA because we were super talented and being wildly disappointed in every loss was very annoying. It was tiring.  If we could've gotten a PG13 type of guy of KD I would've taken it but I would rather have KD than Harrison Barnes on a max.
The man is named after Scottie Pippen and Harrison Barnes - how could this go wrong?
Harrison Barnes- US Senator  Pat Riley- Mafia Boss   Gordon Hayward- Pro Gamer   Donovan Mitchell- Arachnologist   Rajon Rondo- Chess world champion  Jaylen Brown- Professor at a university   Damien Lillard- Rolex salesman   Markelle Fultz- Chick-fil-A manager   Chris Paul- High school principal  Serge Ibaka- Gourmet chef  PJ Tucker- Cobbler
He’s only a few months younger than noted old guy Harrison Barnes
Harrison Barnes
lowkey maybe harrison barnes.
"If you are the Kangz you take Harrell, Kuma and pick 22. You do not go shopping pick 9. I don't even know why they think shopping pick 9 is a good thing.  You got picks 9 and 22. Both no doubt can be role players. You listen to offers for Barnes and Bagley. You resign Holmes. You pick best player available every single time. That is legit all they gotta do this off-season. They are gonna be slightly bottomed out but they could be competitive depending on who they can get for Harrison and Marvin."
"I low-key hate it when we say that a team got nothing if a player leaves in free agency. Kyrie leaving opened up the cap space to sign Kemba Walker, who pre-injuries, looked like a great leader for the young guys on the team (all-star starter, albeit from the East in 2020).  It's like saying the Warriors got KD for nothing. They had to give up Harrison Barnes and other role players."
"Cool - not worth it   Ya’ll don’t even watch Wiggins play just promote a meme of him not living up to his draft pick and max contract….  In reality, he’s our ONLY wing, who’s a defensive stud and ability to drop 20+ on any night and lead our 2nd unit.   He’s been a perfect fit as a 3rd option in the Harrison Barnes role.   Siakam would be an upgrade and is better than Wiggins, in a vacuum…but Wiseman + 7 + 14 is WAY too much for the marginal upgrade."
Maybe I would say Harrison Barnes
"Hield might actually be kinda dope in a smaller role than he is in SAC. A shooter would tend to look better playing next to LeBron and AD instead of Fox and Harrison Barnes, he might be worth this mishmash of mediocre pieces."
"I don't think anyone's writing him off, but you have to remember that NBA teams don't really have players, they have contracts (at least from the team building perspective, which is what we're talking about here).  Reddish is on a rookie deal now where his pay exceeds his production and is likely to continue to do so, but he has immense athletic potential, which is why he was drafted where he was despite being terrible at Duke.  He's going to be up for an extension soon, likely before he even gets a chance to meet his potential (injuries, which you use as an excuse, are a red flag... hurt for 3 years?).  Reddish's next contract will likely exceed his production because guys with his pedigree tend to get overpaid - Harrison Barnes, Andrew Wiggins, Markelle Fultz, etc... - and therefore he's a good candidate to continue to be a bad contract.  Atlanta has a lot of dudes about to get paid, and they have to have some value contracts.  Value contracts tend to be market distortions from superstars (max salary) and rookies that make positive contributions on rookie deals (salary scale).  The Hawks don't need to jump on any offer, but they'd be smart to gauge his value and get some current/future picks that have a chance to turn into contributors on rookie deals like Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges or Halliburton or similarly lower upside guys who can help a team that has its stars.  Another team in a different position might value Reddish's potential more."
"I mean technically if you follow the breadcrumbs, it also netted the Kings Harrison Barnes (Pelicans #10 in 2017, which was flipped for 15 (Justin Jackson) and 20 (Harry Giles). JJ was later flipped (with zbo) for Barnes).  But nobody’s thriving here"
"Doesn’t Harrison Barnes do exactly what Kuzma does, but a bit better? Or is the plan to play them at sf and pf interchangeably"
"I mean it’s not a terrible sign it’s just the reality of the situation. Not everyone is built and bred like Kobe Bryant. The Top 1% of the NBA are heartless killers that don’t give a shit about anything besides domination. The other 99%? Yeah they feel the pressure of being on the road and fans yelling at them, they read the social media and ESPN hot takes calling them garbage, and they generally have feelings like you know a real human being?  Kuzma needing a low pressure change of scenery doesn’t make him any less of a player. Most guys just don’t perform well in these heavily scrutinized organizations like the LAL, NYK, BOS, ect.  If he’s a less efficient Harrison Barnes for $13mil/yr? That’s great value. I see nothing wrong with acquiring him when his contract is so low risk and he still has upside as a player.  As a Laker fan I can tell you that he’s not as bad as everyone has put him out to be. He’s gotten the brunt of so much hate that it would shake ANY player. He’s just not a great fit on a contending team that doesn’t really need what he’s good at."
"Dear lord, Harrison Barnes has stans now?"
"This is a weird time. Harrison Barnes is overvalued by fans, and Buddy Hield is undervalued by fans in an analytics driven league. I'm looking at Barnes and Powell,  scoring and 3 pt effectiveness being tilted towards Powell, Powell is statistically a superior defender... Barnes is steady. He's a really solid piece, especially on a veteran team with established stars around him. I think Powell fits the Kings roster requirements better, and ultimately makes them better."
Mavs fans slandered Harrison Barnes too after they moved him to trade for KP.
"I'd rather have Harrison Barnes, primarily due to his size.  Powell should be defending shooting guards, while Barnes can guard wings.  That's just inherently more valuable.  And calling Norman Powell a fringe all-star quality player is really stretching the definition of fringe all-star quality player to levels not seen even in the early 2000s east."
"First man, tell me what you think ""Fringe"" All-Star means. I want to make sure you don't think a I mean an actual All-Star. I'm talking maybe a few seasons in their career if they were on a better team, or a less saturated position, toes-the-border type player who is a direct 1:1 upgrade at one of the two forward positions. I don't think it's a wild statement to make, that packaging the #9 and Harrison Barnes should result in a player better than Harrison Barnes, which would be considered a win now move for a veteran that is a fringe all-star."
"9 in a package with another player, like a Harrison Barnes makes that deal significantly more valuable. A fringe all-star type player. That's a ""win now"" trade."
"OP, probably:  &gt; Harrison Barnes was the leader!!!"
"When you're the primary shot creator for the worst offense in the league, you're probably not that good at creating shots.   Harrison Barnes shot 40% from 3 once. It doesn't mean he took shots like Duncan Robinson.   You can look at counting stats all you want but they unfortunately just don't paint the whole picture.   I'd take Robinson over Fournier every day of the week if I needed a 2."
"I favored Parker above Wiggins in that draft, I just considered Wiggins a Harrison Barnes with better defensive potential. I though he was way over hyped. Although I was wrong about Parker too."
"I don't get it. JV is better than Adams. Bledsoe can't play in the playoffs. But you're a young team in a tiny market. What are you doing trading back in the draft right now?  Griffin is going to turn this into Cleveland 2005-2009 where the team is so desperate to keep their young star that they flail aimlessly and trade away all their picks and assets to get mediocre players thinking that ""we're showing him we'll do what it takes to win"" when all you wind up with is Mo Williams and Larry Hughes.  By the time Zion leaves, the next best guys on the team are going to be Lonzo and someone like Kuzma or Harrison Barnes and New Orleans won't have half their future 1st rounders. You know, the cornerstones of any real contender."
"Like Siakam, Bogdonovic from Utah, Brogdan, Myles Turner, Harrison Barnes, Gordon Hayward"
"I understand that none of what I'm saying is a given.   But what is certain is that Beal plays shooting guard and is 6'3, isn't that great on defense, and makes 34 and 37 million over the next too years  AND   The Warriors already have a shooting guard who is great on defense, 6'6, and makes 37, 40, and 44 million over the next three years.   That is 80 million for shooting guards? To cover one position?  &amp;#x200B;  So the Warriors are supposed to trade a solid starter (Wiggins), a young promising starter (Wiseman) and two lottery picks in what is expected to be a deep draft to take on a HUGE contract to cover a position they are already paying 40 million for?  It just doesn't make sense.   Especially since they'd have two potential rotation players on rookie contracts that would save them tons of money.  And having talented young players on rookie contracts is critical for cap space.   And the last time they picked a 7 they got Harrison Barnes, and the time before that, they got Curry.   &amp;#x200B;  I just see their current position as a very unique position."
"I like Wiggins, but he is no way better than Harrison Barnes. Barnes had a horrible last three games with us and that’s all people think of him, and I absolutely hate it"
"You're right-ish.  Do I want Wiggins as our #2?  No.   Do I want him as our #3?  Absofuckinlutely.  He's a better Harrison Barnes.  Klay's health is key, as is Wiseman's development."
"Harrison Barnes, Draymond Green, Andrew Bogut was the biggest front court in the league.  Then you had Durant, Draymond Green, bunch of centers like Javale/Zaza/Looney"
Kuzma would get to hang with his twin Harrison Barnes.
"Right, I’m sure a roster with Derrick white, joe Harris, Marcus smart, Harrison Barnes and mason plumlee was the very best they could send. If the best players cared they would be there"
Yes and he was bad and looked lost on court in those limited minutes behind Turner. His only okay game was against a very undersized Japanese team. Pop went small against Gobert with Harrison Barnes.  I'm not saying Lopez is a bad player but thinking he would make a massive difference is simply not true.
"that comment is so misleading lmao. Fiba world cups are so different compared to the oympics where US can bring its best roster. That tournament you mentioned where they finished 7th, had some guys like brook lopez, derrick white, joe harris, harrison barnes clearly not the best roster lmao. Your insane if you don’t believe this roster rn has the potential with better coaching and chemistry to dominate this tournament. I see i international fans always say look at this obscure tournament or exhibition and say see the US isn’t good when there roster is horrible. This was the first olympic loss since 2004, the oympics are the only tournament US actually cares about lmaoo. Compared to past oympics other international teams should still be considered pushovers, they have played teams way better then this france or nigerian teams for example. There are plenty of problems with this roster and USA basketball but actual quality of players isn’t it, ppl love to shit on the US but in reality they could very realistically win gold lmao"
I’m getting Harrison Barnes flashbacks.
"Harrison Barnes is only 29, even his name sounds older. Also, feels like Dwight Howard is in the league for 30 years"
"Personally wouldn’t move Wiggins, he was incredibly consistent this year and looked really good on defense. He can be a better version of Harrison Barnes for them. If the player is Beal/Lillard, you give up whatever you can. But I agree a fringe guy like Holiday level wouldn’t really be worth it. Jaylen Brown maybe?  Curry Klay Brown Wiggins Draymond  Would be a really fun lineup, awesome switching on defense and good shot making/slashing. I think that lineup makes the WCF but I agree with you dude, it ALL depends on how Klay looks."
I never claimed that Harrison Barnes alone is fantastic.
"It's so odd. There's no one with a contract around his size that makes sense. Either he's way better than them and you're downgrading (think Harrison Barnes, Kristaps, D-Lo) or he's not as good as them/doesn't make sense for the other team (McCollum, Brandon Ingram). You can't really flip him for assets either, and teams might actually ask for sweeteners themselves to take his contract.  Doc doesn't run an effective offense. I watched just about every regular season game and noticed a pattern: the man doesn't have a non-iso, go-to play. If they are stuck in the mud, he adds more dirt and water. Any time the offense stagnates, he kind of just leaves them to fend for themselves. It's like he expects hero ball to save the day every time."
"Somehow get him Jimmy Butler and he's 100% staying. Jimmy compliments him perfectly. But realistically, one or more of Simmons, Jerami Grant, Harrison Barnes, Myles Turner, Noel (continues listing 2 way wings and elite defensive bigs)"
Tobias is a better midrange shooter. Harrison is way better on defense and 3 pointers and constantly is tasked with guarding the best small forwards in the league.  In a league that revolves around 3 point shooting and shooting (3 and D) you could argue that Barnes is not only as good of a player but more valuable in his contract
Harrison Barnes take it or leave it.
How exactly does Harris make the Kings better? I’m gonna go out on a limb here and say Harrison Barnes and Harris have equal value in an open trade market and what they provide on the court
We already had him - Harrison Barnes works great as a stretch 4 if you can pair him with a rim protector / rebounder at 5.
"Chandler Parsons, Enes Kanter, Otto Porter, and Harrison Barnes are all recent max contracts for players nowhere near superstar level. Granted, not every max is the same but it’s still the max for that player."
"It's not.  Both Ben and CJ don't have the highest trade value for different reasons. For all of Ben's offensive faults though I see him as a much more integral part of the team than CJ is to Portland.  If you trade Ben, who's guarding the opponent's best player? You'll have a giant hole in the frontcourt that's just not easily replaced unless you all get another wing (and I haven't heard any of them being available).  If you're able to get like Harrison Barnes and Buddy Hield then that's a bit easier to stomach, but yeah I just don't see either Ben or CJ getting an All-Star back."
"If we’re committing to winning now, we need to take a bigger swing than Harrison Barnes. If we’re not, blow the whole thing up"
But did they win 73 games? No? Don't tell me they jettisoned Harrison Barnes just to end up with a WORSE team!
"Any deal with Oubre would be a one year thing, with the other years being non-guaranteed.  If they include Wiseman and some of their non-guaranteed players, then Oubre wouldn't need a big deal.     Say they target Siakam, they would have to send out around $25m to match salaries.  Wiseman is set to make about $9.1m.  Gary Payton II and Alen Smailagic are around $3.7m combined.  That leaves Oubre making around $12.2m for one year.  The Warriors have two or three other guys on non-guaranteed deals, so they could drop Oubre's needed salary down another $1.8m-5.4m.      Even without Wiseman, it'd be about $21m for one year of Oubre.  That's around what Harrison Barnes, Buddy Hield and Garry Harris will make next year.  Yeah, it's not good, but it's not Kevin Love or John Wall bad.  Would be a legendary tax bill though for the Warriors though."
He ain’t even close to a Harrison Barnes level player. Barnes is a solid starter. Kuz is an okay bench piece.
"honestly kuzma is underrated af but no way he's on tatum's level lol, he's more like a harrison barnes"
Welcome home Harrison Barnes.
"Wait for a team to implode or blow it up and go all in on their stars and/or role players. Unfortunately, they're the most likely team to do blow up and I don't think Dame would buy into waiting till closer to the trade deadline when such a deal is feasible. Personally, I think they have a better chance making a Dame+CJ backcourt viable than moving CJ for someone like Simmons which I feel is a lateral move, maybe slight upgrade. I think someone like Hayward at the top end or Harrison Barnes in addition to Dame and CJ is better than Dame+Simmons or Dame+Beal."
With the way they ended the season I could see them being higher than the 8th seed next year. They just need to put better tools around Westbrook. Getting a guy like Jerami Grant or Harrison Barnes would help them a lot
Rabsho’s 2015-16 rants against Harrison Barnes for me
"&gt; Okay, so who do you buy low on?   Well it has to be someone with a big contract so they can trade away CJ. Tobias Harris is the only guy that comes to mind.    Harrison Barnes would be great but there's zero reason for the Kings to even entertain such a trade."
When you join a 73-9 team sans Harrison Barnes yeah probably
"Okay, so who do you buy low on?   DeMar DeRozan? - Alright that's something I guess  I don't really see Oubre or Fournier moving the needle for either of those guys - not a lot of defense going around there.  Reggie Bullock? Honestly I might like him more than the former two but not a needle mover.  A welcome-home show for Nic Batum or Will Barton? Both decent players but may end up commanding a bag bigger than Portland could offer. Also have a hunch Batum wants to end up on a stronger contender.  I like the upside of Otto Porter Jr a lot and that's why I'd ""buy low"" on him. The other guys sans DeRozan don't have a huge ceiling in my opinion or may just not be available for Portland.  I'm also a huge stan of Harrison Barnes to Portland if they can pull off a CJ trade - not a star obviously but makes for a cohesive lineup."
Trade CJ for Harrison Barnes in a 3-team trade.  They don't have the assets to get another All-Star next to Dame but they can do their best to give Dame a **competent** roster next to him (i.e. without star power but without any major holes).  The Blazers haven't had a proper 2-way forward since Nic Batum and it's hurt them a ton.
I was talking about Harrison Barnes
No they wouldn't...... They were gonna fucking max Harrison Barnes. Wtf know your history first..... Yes warriors is the best odds to win but he just sent KD home. KD is a coward for that move.
"It’s like you are deciding what my argument is for me. I never said that all I care about is finals games, I never said anything close to that. If you read my last comment, what I am saying is that seeing a player in a situation you haven’t seen them in before gives you more context and more knowledge about who they are as a player. I’m not arguing that I can boil Harrison Barnes down to a choker, but I am saying that I got a slightly clearer picture of him as a player. I just don’t understand how you can defend your point since you give no criteria for how to decide what games matter. Can I only judge a player by their regular season career averages? Do I have to ignore all accolades because the player was just “lucky” that journalists voted them MVP? My entire point is so mild, literally just that seeing Giannis in the Finals and him showing up should have a small part in ranking a player, and somehow you disagree. Tell me how you can objectively rank a player without gathering all the relevant data, or explain to me how regular season is all you care about because everything else is just chance."
"&gt;That OKC team was not a superteam neither were they referred to as such. Harden was a 6th man at that point, and KD was the only MVP on that team when he(KD)was there.  Not saying they were, a team consisting of a fifth year player alongside a fourth year and a third year player can never be considered a superteam *but* what they were and what they would go on to become is far better than LeBron had.   &gt;Him, Wade, Bosh  Yeah this was a superteam but like I said I've got no problems with them plus they were shown to be mortal in 2011 and then D Wade started to become a worse version of himself in the third season of the team.   &gt;Him, Kyrie, love  Same thing above, Love never really became a true third piece. I saw somebody here say that that Cavs team would have been better if they just had Kyrie/Bron + a bunch of 3&amp;D players.  I just don't respect KD leaving a team he was up 3-1 against and that were the best reg szn team OAT, You can try rationalise it by saying he used Bron's template but using your point - nobody cared that he created a superteam, we cared that he joined the Warriors. How do you replace Harrison Barnes with fuckin Kevin Durant? People would have praised him for joining any other team than the Warriors, literally ANY other team."
"Let me give an example so you can understand what I mean. Let’s look at Harrison Barnes who had a notoriously bad Finals in 2016. That matters because we saw him play on the highest stage and saw that he shrunk away from the pressure. He clearly let some part of being in the Finals get to his head. Now imagine the Warriors had lost to OKC and we never saw him in the Finals. We didn’t get to see that his game took a hit under pressure so we didn’t ever witness that part of his game. I can more accurately rank him because of the situation I got to see him in. Similar thing for Giannis, maybe hw is the same player he was a couple months ago, but it has to matter that when the time came he proved he could take it to the next level, even if many people thought he could (spoiler: before this playoffs many people thought Giannis couldn’t take it to the next level). The ring isn’t what matters, it’s the performance that confirmed or went against people’s previous opinions."
"Again, Harrison Barnes is very much alive."
"Yeah, 4 man super team of … checks notes, Harrison Barnes? Lmao  Lebron did the exact same thing as kd y’all are just dumb lol. Matter fact he’s done it 2-3 times now"
Harrison Barnes rollin over in his grave
"He’d be wise to pull a Harrison Barnes, especially given CP3’s age. Take more money in the long-run, even if AAV is lower.    Something like 3yrs/$100M(ish)"
"Harrison Barnes getting traded mid-game for Z-Bo and Justin Jackson was a big question mark, both in terms of intent and the timing of it."
"Suggs just gives off major Harrison Barnes vibes, like he's going to average 18/4/4 and the Rockets will still lose 50 games a season.  Green can shoot, but he can't pass.  Plus, he's a torn ACL waiting to happen.  Mobley just screams #2 or #3 option, and who knows if the Rockets will get a true #1 option from that clusterfuck of a Chris Paul trade  I guess it's better than OKC having the pick..."
"I just don’t see why that’s “unsustainable?” The Death Lineup that year was peerless and played all of the clutch minutes. The league truly had no answer to it. Even the Cavs series that held up and the series turned primarily on Draymond’s suspension followed by Iguodala’s back problems. Draymond of course was the second best and second most valuable player on that team behind Curry. Of course they could have hit their shots in game 7 (and Harrison Barnes could have not forgotten how to play basketball). But that doesn’t mean it’s unsustainable, that just means that you get beaten. It’s the same as a player missing a buzzer beater but being good overall."
"Kevin Love averaged 8 PPG on 35% shooting. Shaun Livingston averaged 9 PPG on 50% shooting, despite playing slightly fewer minutes. It’s been talked about to death on this very subreddit that he had such an unstoppable mid-range game, which was performed almost exclusively off the dribble. I don’t see how you can make any case whatsoever that Love is a shot creator and Livingston wasn’t, that’s just plain wrong.  If Kevin Love was actually capable of creating his own shot in that series, somebody should have told Ty Lue, because he clearly didn’t know. I’m not saying Kevin Love could never do it at any point in his career, but by the time he went to Cleveland he was really only effective as a shot creator in specific matchups (ie the infamous “Lebronto” series where they leveraged mismatches against smaller guards all series long, or exploited Valanciunas’s very poor defense). Against Golden State, he was just a stretch 4, and not a very effective one at that.  It also seems wrong to label JR Smith as a shot creator at this stage of his career. While he was certainly capable of hitting those wild off-the-dribble three pointers, or even occasionally driving to the rim, he was only consistently effective as a catch-and-shoot specialist. In reality the Cavs had two true shot creators in Lebron and Kyrie. There’s no denying Kyrie is a far better shot creator than anybody Steph played with that season, but beyond those two (and Steph), there really wasn’t anybody of note in that regard on either team. If the only qualification to being labeled a “shot creator” is literally the ability to occasionally make a nice shot off your own dribble, then guys like Harrison Barnes, Andre Iguodola, Leandro Barbosa, and even Draymond Green to a degree, were shot creators at that point. They weren’t, and neither were Love or Smith.  And you can’t use Harrison Barnes poor performance in that series to discredit this point without doing the same for Love. It’s funny, as much flak as Harrison Barnes gets for losing that series, he was pretty even with Love statistically, who gets a pass because of one great defensive play; as well as the fact that the Cav’s won, of course.  The point about Klay not being a superstar is interesting to me. He may be very unorthodox as far as what’s expected of a superstar, and I’d put him in the bottom tier of superstars, but he’s there in my mind. How many non-superstars have scored 40 points in a must win game 6 in the Conference Finals (against a pretty damn great team), or on a similar stage? And it’s not like it was an outlier or anything, he scored over 30 points several times in that playoff run as well. Elite defense + consistent two level scoring (I’ve always thought Klay had an underrated pull-up midrange game, and his perimeter shooting is at worst top-5 all time) equals a superstar to me."
the ghost of Harrison Barnes has entered the chat
I hear you but the death lineup was already deadly with Harrison Barnes. With KD it was downright broken. This is the shit you see on the dream team and you just watch in awe of all that talent.
"Hmm.   2019: traded for their best player  2020: traded for their 2nd best player  2021: traded for their 3rd best player  2022: if Blazers trade CJ for Harrison Barnes, does this mean we're guaranteed a championship?"
Let's get Harrison Barnes on the line and ask him
"[My first mention of Middleton where I compared him to a combination of Jimmy Butler, Harrison Barnes, Paul George, and Kawhi Leonard](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jg3w2/get_to_know_a_new_buck_brandon_knight/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)  I am a long time believer"
"76ers - Dame, Buddy Hield  Kings - Ben Simmons, Robert Covington, Isiah Joe  Blazers - Harrison Barnes, Marvin Bagley, Matisse Thybulle, Tyrese Maxey, 2021 #9 pick (Kings), 2021 #28 Pick (76ers), 2022 Pick Swap, 2023 Top 5 Protected Pick (Kings), 2024 Unprotected Pick (76ers)."
Scottie Pippen and Harrison Barnes made such a beautiful baby
"1) Eligible but not in the league- Isaiah Thomas  2) Short contracts(two-ways, ten-day contracts)- Karim Mané  3) Non-rotation bench players- Justin Robinson  4) Rotational bench player- Brad Wanamaker   5) Elite bench player(6 MOTY candidates)- Jordan Clarkson  6) Basic starter- Harrison Barnes   7) Niche Starter- Myles Turner   8) Elite starter- Jerami Grant   9) Border line All-Star- CJ McCollum   10) All-Star- Donovan Mitchell   11) All-NBA- Luka Doncic   11) MVP Level- Kevin Durant"
Has anyone ever seen Harrison Barnes and Andrew Wiggins in the same room?
"If we didn't get KD we might've played for Gordon. He was on the market at the time and he's better than Harrison Barnes. That might've been a pretty fun, good iteration of the warriors.  Naturally I'm pretty pleased with how history shook out for us."
"Hi I’ve been drinking a lot of purple kool-aid these past few weeks  The Kings are gonna make a big jump. I’m not even exaggerating when I say they can even get up to 6th seed, but that’s assuming a lot goes wrong for other teams, like the blazers, clippers, warriors, and Mavs— and of course all the other potential play-in teams like minny, nola, and San Antonio  Of course I’m expecting us somewhere around 9-10. BUT kings have a few things working for us  Fox is a beast, and if he improves even more, like he has pretty much every season, he’s at an all star level. Tyrese Haliburton kicks ass and is going to be solid no matter what. Harrison Barnes is underrated af and at least league average. Richaun Holmes has like 95% accurate hook shot and can play great defense, and is a great roller on offense.   Our bench is the deepest it’s been in like 10 years. Yeah, it’s not the best, but now with guys like Buddy off the bench, Bagley if he makes a double jump- in terms of defense and health (he can be a walking 18/8), Alex Len to give us some size, Terence Davis for extra shooting and some defense, Harkless and TT for the vet presence, and potential up-and-comers like Chimezie Metu (ask Spurs fans) and our boy Davion MITCHELL to round it out  Obviously last year we had one of the statistically worst defenses ever, but we saw it get better to the end of the season. We got a couple new defensively minded assistant coaches in Doug Christie and Longabardi, we got some grittier players in our rookie Davion Mitchell AKA Off-Night, Terence Davis, Mo Harkless, Alex Len, and hopefully we embrace the chip on our shoulder of not being in the playoffs for so long  So, yeah I could go on and on about why I think we’ll be better. Even with Luke Walton, even with our shitty defense last season, even with our lack of traditional forwards. The kings are making a jump this year, into the play-in at least and hopefully right into the playoffs  I know the Kings are the joke of the league and have been for a long time but it ends this season. From Sacramento we’re gonna see a jump like the Knicks, hawks, and Suns had last year.   When all the media and you motherfuckers look back at the end of the season and go “wow we had no idea they were gonna be so good” I want you to look back at posts like these cause goddamn it some of us knew it was coming"

harrison barnes
All star: Gordon Hayward and Kyle Lowry  Role player: Harrison Barnes and Nic Batum
"Harrison Barnes is the most average but good player in the league.  He'll score points on good efficiency, get a few rebounds and assists, play good D, and you'll never notice."
"And Harrison Barnes is looking like he never was either. I think it comes down to what they can get elsewhere. If I had to bet, I would say the Warriors offer him Dray money in his final year assuming he keeps producing. But if he's integral and other teams consider giving him the MAX (which is what I think HB's situation was) they might have to do it. Although, things are different now. With the core aging and Poole, Wiseman, Kuminga and Moody needing to get paid in a few years, tough choices might have to be made."
"It depends on our success though. Remember, we were going to give Harrison Barnes the MAX too. But then we got KD. If we make it to the WCF and Wiggins is a solid fit, you don't think he gets the MAX or Dray money?"
"They didn’t lose a lot of depth, the 3 players in the 2015-16 that aren’t on the 2016-17 roster are Bogut, Ezeli and Speights.  Bought and ezeli are replaced by McGee (who played pretty good for the warriors) and ZaZa (we all know what he did, and he is a terrible person for that) and then David west replaced Speigts.  Edit: and obviously Harrison Barnes who was directly replaced by KD."
"Unpopular opinion but I don’t think super teams on its own work. Sure Golden State worked for sure, but they were an already sound team and they added the best scorer in the world for basically just Harrison Barnes. They kept Draymond, Iggy, Livingston and West. They play very team oriented regardless where everyone shares the ball. This new era stacking high level prospects with the 76ers, OKC and Cavs will do more harm than good"
could definately see harrison barnes winning again
"A combative, entitled, superior attitude is prevalent  Look into the interactions of WNBA stars with Iguodala, Boogie, T-Mac, Luka, Harrison Barnes, etc"
"And if LeBron didn't portray an Oscar worthy performance to get Draymond out, plus needing assistance from Harrison Barnes, you think he would have won in 2016?"
"Let's summarize rather than reword or restate what we've already said. You: LeBron is more skilled because he can get layups to pad his fg% stats due to lack of any physical play or contact in this era.  As a result, he still has a losing finals record of 4/10 including getting swept twice and also losing to a Mavericks team while playing with two other hall of famers in their prime.  His wins include the the mickey mouse finals against an injured heat team, and an mvp performance by Harrison Barnes after which he declared himself the goat, less championship's while taking longer.  And if we're talking stats, don't hide his ft%.  That's who youre saying your #1 is.  I don't know when the bar dropped so much where we celebrate who came in second more as the case for who is the greatest.  Sure, you really got me there."
Did you really mention Harrison Barnes? Lmao.  He was mvp for the cavs when they won.
"If we are talking about chips , you refuse to take into account level of competition . LeBron had harder competition   San Antonio Spurs with Greg Popovich, Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, Kawhi Leonard. There's 5 hall of famers right there and LeBron had to face them 3 times. The first year, he had Boobie Gibson as his second best player haha. Golden State Warriors with Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Harrison Barnes, Kevin Durant (for 2 years). LeBron had to face them 4 times. The first year he lost Kyrie and Love for the whole series. The second year, Warriors went 73-9 (all-time record) and was down 3-1 for the biggest comeback in the history of sports. Third and fourth year, that 73-9 team added Kevin Durant. One of those years, he had to face the Thunder that had Durant, Westbrook, Harden, Ibaka and then the only team he was favored to beat that he lost to, was Dallas Mavericks, who collectively outperformed the predictions by beating Portland, sweeping past champion Lakers, and beating OKC who had Durant, Westbrook, Harden."
"I don't think I ever thought he'd be an all-time great,  but I was really hoping Harrison Barnes would be an all-star caliber player. Which, I suppose you could argue he is/could be.   &amp;#x200B;  But I was hoping more than ""I suppose you could argue he is"" from him."
"I tend to blame Harrison Barnes more than I blame Draymond. Yes he got suspended for Game 5, but HBs poor shooting along with Bogut's injury are more to blame."
A realistic team base off salary cap.   Ben   Seth curry   Harrison Barnes / miles bridges   Kristaps/   Kat/ brook Lopez
"A lot of us shit on Harrison Barnes but aside from the 7 game stretch of his worst, he’s not bad overall though. He’s a great teammate who doesn’t upset the locker room, plays solid defense. His offense is kinda disappointing but he fits in well and experience with the Warriors offense. At least he’s not a ball hog or demands the ball like Oubre. I’d honestly rather have Barnes than Wiggins anti-vax bullshit right now lol."
"&gt;Harrison Barnes  Why? So he can shoot a million open bricks in the finals, thus leading to one of the most famous choke jobs in NBA history? 😂"
"When he joined the Warriors they were far from generational talents, Kerr's system and rhetoric is what got them there  Watch Curry and co talk about how he got them to completely change the system and everything, they were an iso team who ran Harrison Barnes isos before Kerr, then they moved to a motion offense + a bit of triangle, plus the inclusion of Draymond at the 5, making Iggy a 6th man, all done by Kerr and decisions that just changed everything   Warriors were bounced in the first round before Kerr"
Go to any non playoff team and try to get their best veterans.  Harrison Barnes. Dillon Brooks. Kyle Anderson. Thad Young. Derrick White. Etc. you could get a legit starter. A 6th man. And a big to fill the roster.
wiggins is an overpaid harrison barnes.
"He's top ten. Really think about this team: Klay, Draymond, Bogut, and Harrison Barnes. Iguodala off the bench. That's a pretty good team, not an all-time great team.  What other players in history could step in and make this the winningest team ever? Who else in the top ten is that good?   People are saying dumb things about how he's not tall enough and not good enough on defense. A player's impact isn't just a collection attributes. In the end it's about winning. And there are not ten players in history who are better than Steph at making his team win, due to his absurd shooting efficiency and scoring. If you make more shots than your opponent, then you win. And nobody is better at it than Steph."
"Why is there this myth that he was ""controlling the game""   The only reason they had a 2-1 lead is because Harrison Barnes and Draymond sold hard in game 3 and shot a combined 2-18  Literally the main point people make is that ""he held the ball a lot so that the Warriors couldn't get into a rhythm"" but plenty of guys could do that lmao  I swear people just look at PTS/REB/AST and don't actually watch the games, he was awful in games 4-6"
"Harrison Barnes is very smart. Also Dwight Powell. Got a bachelors from Stanford in Science, Tech, and society."
"Yes, it should of not made it to the public but why should he focus on getting him to play when he says he already tried but was stonewalled immediately? And the comment is absolutely true with the reports of Simmons and his team just dismissing Embiid,tise and so forth who went to him to play. Also, the dude  already antagonised himself regardless of if the trade request went out or Doc throwing him under the bus as literally everybody in Philly were ready to throw him under when he's one of their highest paid athletes and puts up Harrison Barnes 2016 finals stats in critical games of that series."
This is giving me flashbacks to 2016 Harrison Barnes…
Counterpoint  Harrison Barnes
Sorry to tell you but trading your entire future for Harrison Barnes Tristan Thomson Marvin Bagley and Davion Mitchell isn’t doing anything to raise their potential ceiling.   &gt;Getting a player like Barnes who could be a deadly 2nd/3rd option is what the Warriors need to do for Steph.  I’m just going to assume you started watching basketball 2 weeks ago lol
"Raptors - tougher opponents   Middleton   Celtics 3   Giannis   Harden   2022 first overall pick   Lamelo   Scottie (obviously I’m biased, but aside from the bias the injury risk is still scary with MPJ)   Harrison Barnes   Dorture chamber  Heat Bron"
Harrison Barnes would like a word.
"Where the fuck is Harrison Barnes on this list? He's averaging a totally sustainable 27/10/2 on 50/50/80 splits.    Where is the respect, people??  (I know he'll fall off, but we'd be 0-4 without him lol)"
Bring back Harrison Barnes!
I mean I actually think that would be pretty cool. Harrison Barnes just decides to switch it on in his 11th year 😂
imagine the scenes if Harrison Barnes wins an MVP...
"I’m gonna go out on a limb here and say the league will correct itself, like it seems to always do. I don’t think Harrison Barnes is gonna finish the season averaging 27 and 10 while shooting 51% from 3…"
Based solely on the numbers I have to say Harrison Barnes and Miles Bridges will be the captains.  It's just math.
"I'm not siding with Simmons. He should have reported to training camp and practice. Squashed his beef with Embiid and played this season. He may still insists on getting traded with the front office, but be professional and play while doing it. Take James Harden in Houston for example, he made it known that he wants to be traded, but he show up and played. So Simmons is being very unprofessional.  However, I don't like that Morey is purposely making the situation worse. Just trade the dude, take the loss, and get the drama over with. He may think it's all business and nothing personal, but the way it is seems like he is taking it personal and trying to make life hell for Simmons. Sixers still have Embiid, Harris, Curry, Green, Maxey, Thybulle, and Milton. Get picks for Simmons plus a secondary star player like McCollum, Malcom Brogdon, Wiggins, Jeremy Grant, Harrison Barnes, etc, and use that to trade for better talent when one becomes available, maybe Lillard next year when Portland gets bounced early in the Playoffs again and the Billups experience isn't living up to the promise."
"I've been open to trading either of Turner or Sabonis for ages - the issue is though that if we traded either, we'd be looking for a defensive-minded stretch-4 back and those players are about as rare as someone with Turner's skillset. We got close apparently with the Gordon Hayward S&amp;T.  Here's a list of forwards I'd think be a great fit next to Sabonis - pretty much none of them are available:  Johnathan Issac, Marcus Morris, OG Anunoby, Dorian Finney-Smith, Aaron Gordon, Robert Covington  PJ Washington is about the only player I could see a realistic trade for.  We'd have to be high on PJ (I am, I don't know if many others are). For what it's worth, Miles Bridges erupting to start the season has made him more expendable. Apparently Charlotte's tried a few times to offer PJ and a 1st for Turner and I think that's a realistic return.  I'd also like Harrison Barnes, but he's on a hot-streak right now."

Who did you guys let Harrison Barnes go for again?
"Harrison Barnes, Carmelo Anthony, Scottie Barnes"
"Hmm, nbot sure why it might have returned that. I think first think I'd check is if you're able to run any player (try with a rookie, they have less games and it'll go quicker). If that returns actual output then I'm not sure what to think.  But I ran Klay's data to check/ for you and got this:  | Rank   | Player    | Assists| |:-----------|------------:|:------------:| | 1 | Stephen Curry | 187 | 2 | David Lee | 169 | 3 | Draymond Green | 162 | 4 | Harrison Barnes | 97 | 5 | Kevin Durant | 81 | 6 | Andrew Bogut | 75 | 7 | Andre Iguodala | 72 | 8 | Marreese Speights | 56 | 9 | Zaza Pachulia | 50 | 10 | David West | 42 | 11 | Shaun Livingston | 40 | 12 | Carl Landry | 38 | 13 | Brandon Rush | 35 | 14 | Festus Ezeli | 30 | 15 | Kevon Looney | 27 | 16 | JaVale McGee | 25 | 17 | DeMarcus Cousins | 20 | 18 | Jeremy Tyler | 14 | 19 | Omri Casspi | 13 | 20 | Nate Robinson | 13 | 21 | Quinn Cook | 12 | 22 | Dorell Wright | 11 | 23 | Jonas Jerebko | 11 | 24 | Jordan Bell | 10 | 25 | Charles Jenkins | 10 | 26 | Jermaine O'Neal | 9 | 27 | Patrick McCaw | 8 | 28 | Dominic McGuire | 8 | 29 | Alfonzo McKinnie | 7 | 30 | Damian Jones | 7 | 31 | Richard Jefferson | 6 | 32 | James Michael McAdoo | 6 | 33 | Jarrett Jack | 6 | 34 | Leandro Barbosa | 6 | 35 | Jordan Crawford | 6 | 36 | Monta Ellis | 5 | 37 | Chris Wright | 4 | 38 | Nick Young | 4 | 39 | Ekpe Udoh | 4 | 40 | Damion Lee | 4 | 41 | Ian Clark | 3 | 42 | Matt Barnes | 3 | 43 | Mickell Gladness | 3 | 44 | Andris Biedriņš | 2 | 45 | Anderson Varejão | 2 | 46 | Justin Holiday | 2 | 47 | Steve Blake | 2 | 48 | Jason Thompson | 2 | 49 | Ish Smith | 2 | 50 | Mikki Moore | 1 | 51 | Hilton Armstrong | 1 | 52 | Kwame Brown | 1"
"I hate it when people use PTS/AST/REB instead of PTS/REB/AST. It's slightly more understandable when giving the lines for an assist man who doesn't get many rebounds like Trae or CP3, but it makes absolutely no sense for Harrison Barnes. OP's making it look like he's putting up All-NBA numbers"
