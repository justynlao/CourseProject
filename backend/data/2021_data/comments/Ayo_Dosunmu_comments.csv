Ayo Dosunmu
"&gt;maybe one outside of the top 5  Bouknight for sure is one. I actually think I might have him a touch too high here. If UConn flames out hard, I could see if slipping because the SG market is ridiculous competitive for this draft. His whole schtick is that hes been one of the best scorers in college basketball and if that slips, then so does his stock.  He's a bit on the older side (relative to the one and dones) and his entire impact is in his scoring.  If he shows he can't get it done in the tournament, I could see him slipping hard, but if he does, I think theres a reasonable chance that a GM could bite on him on the first guard outside of Cade/Green/Suggs. Though I personally think he's a bit of a fools gold - that'll just show through unless he can have a great tournament.  Ayo Dosunmu is another. Ayo has a lot of question marks in terms of his NBA role and ability for things to translate, as well as his age curve, so if he can keep himself in the spotlight and continue to prove that hes simply better than the competition as an elite scoring option, I think that would be hugely beneficial. I could see a team reaching on him hard if he leads teh Illini far, but also dropping if he's forgotten about quickly after an upset.  &gt;another currently out of your 1st round  Herb Jones just played the best basketball of his career leading Alabama to the SEC championship and I think Alabama are a decent darkhorse in the tournament. I personally believe they should have been the 1 seed over Michigan. He will have a ton of eyes on him  if he leads Alabama far, and theres plenty of contenders with late 1sts who could use his role player skillset.   Miles McBride is another (for 3rd seed WVU), but I technically included him in the 1st for this mock (for the first time), but im really not confident at all he will be a 1st rounder."

"I’m leaning towards that. They seem to tune him out.  Tatum’s inconsistent effort makes me want to trade him but the fact is that at 22, he has put up some impressive numbers... and he could end up being a top 10 player.  Trading Jaylen probably wouldn’t be a good idea either as he’s only 23 and shoots with great efficiency and he plays hard and plays good D.  We need a coach who lights a fire under these guys and we need to get a player with enough potential to push Tatum to playing harder.  Ziaire Williams, Jared butler, Ayo dosunmu or josh cristopher - could one of these guys excel enough to push the Celtics above mediocrity?  The celts are so predictable on offense and need another guy who can create their own shot.  I’m sick of this shit!"

"Lakers draft Ayo Dosunmu with the 22nd pick, problem solve,"
Ayo Dosunmu is the best player in this years draft
r/Suns Ayo Dosunmu and Garza
I'm biased but Ayo Dosunmu is gonna have a great career
Ayo Dosunmu?
When they pick Ayo Dosunmu they’ll have this
He's not Ayo Dosunmu! The mask made him even better lol
"Right I guess I was thinking it was more conclusive. I see a guy around the same size with a longer wingspan, Ayo Dosunmu with an 8’0”  reach. Unless he’s also doing the shenanigans"
"Yep, suspect for sure. Tre Mann is 6'4.25"", with a 6'4 wingspan (3 inches shorter than Keon's) and still has an 8'2.5"" reach. How is he the same height, with a much shorter wingspan, but still a taller reach.  Gotta say tho, Ayo Dosunmu is the most suspicious lol. 6'5 with a 6'10.25"" wingspan but an 8'0.5"" reach? C'mon now."
"Post-lotto mock draft.

Ayo Dosunmu. He’s a beast on defense and knows how to score in so many different ways
Ayo Dosunmu RoTY and it isn't even close
"I'm aware of Tony Bradley from his stint in Philadelphia and I don't think he's moving the needle. I saw ayo dosunmu play and I like his game I don't think he's going to see a lot of minutes and now that they have Lonzo Ball it should open up Coby Whites game up he's a pretty good three level scorer and can give you points coming off the bench or in a small ball lineup which I think we're going to see a lot of.  And I think you missed the point about the bulls needing a inside shot blocking presence that Gafford would have given them.  Because they are not getting any of that from Troy brown while he may have a higher upside than Gafford but how does that help them when you have a log jam at perimeter wing players with Patrick Williams, and Zach lavine, DeMar DeRozan there only so many minutes and how many can they find for him 12 to 15 a game tops?"
"1)  Gafford sucks.  You could put a broomstick in there with Westbrook, and if it can catch lobs at a respectable clip, Russ will make said broomstick look like Moses Malone.  Chicago moved him for Troy Brown Jr, who has considerably higher upside &amp; is a much more adequate fit for the contemporary NBA, on both sides of the ball  2) Chicago's defense will be fine.  It wasn't that bad last yr, and they shored up their perimeter D big time over the off-season.  Their overall D won't be stellar or anything, but it won't be terrible either.   Maybe actually go look up the stats/evidence before commenting?  The Bulls biggest weaknesses last season by far were ball distribution, turnovers, &amp; free throw attempts.  Both issues have been addressed &amp; subsequently remedied  They've also acquired Tony Bradley, who is a young, serviceable big body down low, and have a 21 yr old 7-footer from Montenegro, Marko Simonovic, that they've recently brought on board, who was their second rd draft pick last yr &amp; is already at the advocate centre practicing with Billy D &amp; their 2nd rd pick from this yr, Ayo Dosunmu, who also looks to be a solid NBA perimeter defender"
"I wanted Ayo Dosunmu so badly, after Chicago took him I was in full fuck it node and didn't care lol.  Begarin didn't look terrible here though."
Ayo Dosunmu or Ethan Thompson
Ayo Dosunmu
"Our current depth chart:   PG: Lonzo Ball / Alex Caruso / Ayo Dosunmu   SG: Zach Lavine / Coby White / Javonte Green(?)  SF: DeMar DeRozan / Troy Brown Jr.   PF: Patrick Williams / Lauri Markannen(?)   C: Nikola Vucevic / Tony Bradley / Marko Simonovic   I doubt Lauri is on the team, hopefully he’s traded for some defensive bigs because we’re in a bad position if we don’t get any rim protection. Javonte Green is a nice bench piece and should be coming back on the QO."
The league ain't ready. The Bulls are about to make noise as a dangerous playoff team this year:  * Zach LaVine * Nikola Vucevic * DeMar DeRozan * Lonzo Ball * Coby White * Patrick Williams * Alex Caruso * Troy Brown * Marko Simonovic * Ayo Dosunmu
"This Bulls roster is giving me serious Atlanta Hawks vibes. Lavine basically said ""I know you have shit ton of cap space, get me some fucking help"" and the management did just that. Although Hawks roster was constructed in a more heliocentric fashion around Trae, the Bulls did pretty fine too. By end of reg. season, if all these players develop a solid chemistry, a deep playoffs run is definitely on the table.   Also, LET'S GOOOO AYO DOSUNMU!!! (I-L-L-I-N-I represent)"
"With a bench of Caruso, Coby white, Ayo Dosunmu, and whatever they can get for Lauri"
"I can see the bulls flipping Lauri and Coby White for a big now too. Lotta guards on the roster   (Lonzo Ball, Zach LaVine, DeMar DeRozan, Alex Caruso, Coby White, Ayo Dosunmu, Devon Dotson)"
SOON TO BE JOINED BY NBA MVP AYO DOSUNMU
"And yet it happens. Primo and Ayo Dosunmu were ranked just 4 spots apart by the Ringer (27 and 31) and yet Primo was drafted 12th while Dosunmu fell to 38th overall, despite no negative reports about him pre-draft.  It's not just an outlier on the Ringer either, NBADraft.net had them at 19/24, CBS had Dosunmu at 20 and Primo down at 30... the point is that as you pointed out, these pre-draft rankings are arbitrary, and not every team follows them. While the Spurs clearly valued Primo highly enough to take him at 12, it's not outrageous to suggest that he could've instead fallen below his 'ranking' according to the prevailing wisdom.  Fwiw, I don't consider him a 2nd round talent, but I definitely think there's a strong chance he was available with either 19 or 21."
Ayo Dosunmu
"yeah if they were looking for a high upside shot creator to reach for, you could have taken anyone from Cam Thomas to Ayo Dosunmu. personally I think while Primo isn't an amazing athlete, hell both lean out and get bigger and stronger in the NBA so I'd be surprised if he does go from okay athlete to quite good by 20. he's got pretty crazy range in some of his clips so maybe he'll show it I the NBA. still would've probably taken Moody of the two if you're just hoping they pan out as more than expected. Sengun was my darling personally"
Are Jared Butler and Ayo Dosunmu in a satanic cult or some shit
I didn't know who he was an hour ago but I now want the Knicks to draft Ayo Dosunmu more than I've wanted anything since I got off work today.
We really could've had Ayo Dosunmu huh.
So the second round still has:   * Sharife Cooper  * Jared Butler  * Miles McBride  * Ayo Dosunmu  * Jason Preston  * Joe Wieskamp  * Isaiah Todd * Isaiah Livers * Joel Ayayi * BJ Boston  There's some really good talent in there.
Why wasn't Ayo Dosunmu graded as a 1st rounder? He was one of the best players last year.
ayo dosunmu is gonna be a steal
I will be so happy if Ayo Dosunmu stays in Chicago

Star: Jalen Suggs   Bust: Scottie Barnes   Steal: Ayo Dosunmu
Star: Mobley  Bust: Barnes  Steal: Ayo Dosunmu
Ayo dosunmu will be the steal of the draft
"Most noise for the Hawks is around Cam Thomas, Ayo Dosunmu and Jaden Springer in that order."
"Bucks have the 31st pick while feels like a pretty volatile place. The dream is Ayo Dosunmu or JT Thor drop past the first round, but more realistically hoping for Miles McBride or Quentin Grimes."
"Josh Primo, Ayo Dosunmu, Kessler Edwards, Charles Bassey"
"Realistically, try to resign BP to the MLE. Draft a backup point guard with this year's 31st pick like Ayo Dosunmu. Continue to develop Nwora, Merrill, Diakite, Bryant and hope one of them hits. Pray that DD fully recovers and rehabs from his season-ending injury."
"Lol  Ayo Dosunmu is projected to be in the 20s in this years draft  He’s also Yoruba. Bam, Oladipo are also Yoruba lol"
For the Bulls Ayo Dosunmu. Great ball handler especially in the pick and roll with elite defensive upside. His shooting is what made him fall in the draft but if he works on it he could be a really good NBA player.
"Last gm drafted him and with Casey as the couch it was a poor situation; Sekou was a raw prospect but Casey doesn't want to give guys the minutes to develop. Bad team or not, Casey wants to do everything he can to win the game in front of him. Then Jerami Grant, who plays the same position, became the de facto franchise player. Saddiq Bey is older and more developed than Sekou; his skillset is what you want from a role player, so he naturally jumped in the rotation.   Sekou also dealt with random injuries like concussions that kept him out and missed valuable learning minutes because of the pandemic. Remember that between March and December of 2020, he didn't play organized basketball.   His summer league wasn't good. He had a big game but for the most part he blended into the court. You're expecting more from a 3rd year player in summer league. On the other hand, he's still only 20 years old. For comparison: Saddiq Bey (22), Jalen Smith (21),  De'Andre Hunter (23), Brandon Ingram (23), Davion Mitchell (23), Chris Duarte (24), Tey Murphy (21), Ayo Dosunmu (22), Pascal Siakam (27). I don't think it's fair to write him off yet, but if he's going to grow it wasn't going to be in Detroit."
Inb4 Ayo Dosunmu drops 20 on the Celtics in a couple weeks.
"Ayo Dosunmu looked great as well, getting meaningful minutes in a close game. He played good defense, 7 pts, 2 rebs, and 1 block in 11 minutes."
Ayo Dosunmu looking as good as a rookie can be expected to look
"I know he's a second rounder, but Ayo Dosunmu has looked really nice in summer league and preseason. Billy Donovan said he was the player who has stood out the most during training camp so far.  Wouldn't be surprised if he gets more time than people are expecting"
Keep sleeping on Ayo Dosunmu!!
"Vucevic had a great game. I hope he can build on this because he's been MIA all season. He had a slow start and was just starting to warm up when he got COVID, sat out a few games, and was cold again when he returned. It's amazing the Bulls have done so well essentially without his help. They will be so much better with his help.  Another Bulls player who started the season late and still isn't in his groove is Coby White. A lot of Bulls fans are calling for rookie Ayo Dosunmu to get more of Coby's minutes, but Coby has played much better than this in the past and it looks like the coaches want to give him minutes so he can get back to form. Even if they ultimately trade him, as some fans are saying they should, they need him to be playing well or no one will want him.  And Ayo, for all his great plays, also makes a lot of rookie mistakes. With the Bulls playing as well as they are, there's nothing wrong with bringing Ayo along a little more slowly.  Alex Caruso has been wonderful on defense but not as wonderful on offense.  He, too, can play better, and his last two games -- really three of his last four games -- have been good offensive games. He needs to keep that going, because it's harder to play him long minutes if he isn't offering much on offense.  It's annoying that the Hornets went on a 19-4 run at the beginning of the fourth quarter to make the game close again, but at least the Bulls responded well and won handily in the end. The Hornets are a good team and this was a great win."
needs Ayo Dosunmu
Javonte green Tony Bradley Ayo dosunmu Derrick jones jr Coby white   Checkmate
how is Dosunmu looking this season? i was always surprised to see him falling into the 2nd round in mocks and was even more surprised to see him selected at 38. Always seemed to have more ability than that.  Also is there any point in playing coby white anymore when u have Ayo?
"Ayo Dosunmu, I think he is going to be a solid role player for many years, maybe even a starter on a shallow team. If he surprises me and turns into an all-star I'd be ok with that!"
Lavine   Lonzo  Derozen  Vuc  Patrick Williams  Alex Caruso  Coby White  Ayo Dosunmu
Ayo Dosunmu. Trust me.
Ayo Dosunmu
"Biased: Chris Duarte  Unbiased: Ayo Dosunmu  Why on the unbiased? Well, it's a somewhat random pick, but he's a second rounder who has actual playing time so it's looking okay. he might develop, he might not. Give it 5 years."
Biased answer as I'm a Bulls fan but.... What If Ayo Dosunmu got a lot better at everything? That'd be pretty great! It's only his rookie season right now. And he's still only 21 years old.
"I don't know about superstar, but Ayo Dosunmu was a second round pick this year and has been playing out of his mind. Absolute stud on defense and plays with hella confidence on offense"
This kid Ayo Dosunmu plays with great energy. Love to see it.
His full name is Ayo Omar’s Coming Dosunmu
"Attended the game and it was awesome! It felt like there were almost as many Bulls fans as Clippers fans — as a Bulls fan myself, it was a great feeling.  DeMarvelous DeRozan was so dominant all game, but in the first half he was automatic. I’m starting to see comments here and there about him being a dark horse MVP candidate, and while that’s an optimistic take IMO, his impact for this team cannot be understated. He keeps the offense afloat when the bench is in (bench mob has a lot of high energy guys but no real playmakers while Coby White is out), and he’s a real calming presence with the starters which really showed on nights like this. Every time the Clippers pushed to within 5 or so down the stretch, the Bulls answered. When we just needed a bucket, DeMar got one for us. The team was poised under pressure and pulled off a solid win on the road. This sort of thing never happened in the last few years. Usually, it’s just Zach playing hero ball (out of necessity), and when his shot wasn’t falling (as it wasn’t in the first half tonight) we’d fall apart. But with DeMar, Zach doesn’t need to force as much and can focus on hitting the big shots he’s now proving he can hit.   Then add in Lonzo looking like a bonafide sniper and Caruso locking down everyone. Plus high motor guys in Javonte Green and Ayo Dosunmu off the bench. This team is so much fun to watch.   I’M HYPE, NEIL FUNK!"
"Bones Hyland is the most impressive player in the very early season outside of the top 10, besides Duarte. He is starting to play valuable minutes and a valuable role for a playoff team. Can't get much better than that. Same could be said about Dalano Banton and Ayo Dosunmu, even though both of them thrive because of mostly pure hustle and less because of very valuable, role-oriented skills. At least compared to Bones.  I dig what I see from Jeremiah Robinson-Earl, from OKC. He has the tools to be a good role player in the NBA for a long time. He rebounds well for his size, makes the simple right plays.   Same could be said about Herbert Jones from the Pelicans, but he mostly stands out with his defensive effort because the rest of the Pelicans are really, really bad as a team. Including Trey Murphy III, but he'll figure out his best role once Zion is back. Someday.   I get the mentioning of Sengün, but I don't like the Iso-heavy playstyle of the Rockets at all. He's good at anticipating where the ball goes on defense and he has a few flashes as a scorer and playmaker on offense. Advanced stats love him, eye test isn't that convincing for me yet (looks like a Delon Wright case from the past where stats are more uplifting than the eye test). I'd love to see a whole lot more of Garuba, honestly. It's a shame he doesn't get to play and show his defensive tools - I hope Stone sends Wood or Theis out before the trade deadline.   I'm sensing that Tre Mann is starting to slowly find his shot and confidence on offense. He looks really interesting as a Lou Will type of player. I trust him more than Cam Thomas and he could be visually even wetter than Bones on some nights if he finds his groove and role in Oklahoma. His skill to create separation from defender is pretty remarkable. Buuut.. He has a long ways to go to even earn a stable role in the Thunder's rotation.   I don't truly understand Snyder benching Jared Butler after Butler's poor start (let him play through it, because, God, the Jazz need more athleticism, smart playmaking and youth on the perimeter).   There hasn't really been anything more. Mamukelashvili was... um, tolerable as the worst option in the Bucks frontcourt when Lopez and Portis were both out. I guess you can say the same about Garza and probably Bassey when he gets more minutes as Embiid is in the protocols. Moses Moody will give sporadic minutes every now and then, but I think he'll mostly be in the G-League. Most of the guys outside of the top 10 are waiting for their chances in January-April, when vets are having more rest days and tank race is underway, especially after February."
Ayo Dosunmu
Ayo Dosunmu Bulls rookie
AYO DOSUNMU WOULD LIKE A WORD
The Bulls also get quality minutes and tons of energy from the bench. Ayo Dosunmu in particular is going to be a player to watch.
Ayo dosunmu has played key minutes for Chicago but snubbed
AYO DOSUNMU
AYO DOSUNMU
Bulls won't even need Coby White much at all if Ayo Dosunmu keeps going off goddamn
Ayo dosunmu
His spirit is broken now that he has realized Ayo Dosunmu is going to win ROTY.
"Bulls: 6-1. With solid wins against Utah Jazz and Boston Celtics. Our only loss was a one point loss to the Knicks. And we even had the ball at the end to try to win that game.  I'm really happy with how our new additions are playing: DeMar DeRozan, Lonzo Ball, Alex Caruso, Ayo Dosunmu, Derrick Jones Jr. They are hustling on offense and hustling on defense! I love how they play with a sense of urgency!  Special shoutout to Ayo Dosunmu who feels like an absolute steal at #38 draft. Especially since we didn't draft anyone before him this year. (Our first round draft pick was packaged in a deal to get Vucevic).  It sucks to lose Patrick Williams for the year. I hope he recovers from wrist injury as quickly as possible."
Ayo Dosunmu and DeMar DeRozen are two different players
AYO DOSUNMU
"Little thing here, but Ayo Dosunmu is showing flashes of very good guard defense. Could be a sneaky guy out of this draft."
"Bulls bench went nuts. Rookie Ayo Dosunmu 6/6 FG. Him, Caruso, and DJJ put the clamps on the Celtics ballhandlers."
"Ayo Dosunmu is not just a player, he’s an idea"
"Ayo ""Can't Miss"" Dosunmu  DeMar DeJordan"
Ayo Dosunmu I-L-L baby!!!
Ayo...Dosunmu quick up the ROY ranking
"It's Ayo Dosunmu, he was great at Illinois."
Ayo? And I ain’t mean Dosunmu
First Round Pick Ayo Dosunmu. Didn't even matter we lost our first 😎
"Funny thing is, the Bulls have the best closer in college basketball in Ayo Dosunmu. I wound have yolo'ed and put him to close the game."
