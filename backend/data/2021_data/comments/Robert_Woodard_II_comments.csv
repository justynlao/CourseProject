Robert Woodard II  (from the Kings)
MVP: Pat Beverly   DPOY: Damian Lillard   MOY: Giannis   ROY: Robert Woodard II   MIP: Steph Curry
"For y'all's sake, I hope so too!  I just remember Queta had amazing measurables coming out of college. Tall, long, athletic, etc. I assume he must be pretty raw since he fell so far, but the potential seems to be there.  What do you think about the other guys at the roster fringe, like Jah'mius Ramsey, Robert Woodard II, and Louis King?"
"Here's something I wrote for a different Kings post (after the Luke Walton firing).  ---------  As far as roster goes, I think everyone's movable at the right price. However, the biggest issue is the lack of decent players at every non-PG position. Peep their depth chart.  PG: Fox | Davion Mitchell | Jah'mius Ramsey  SG: Haliburton (also PG) | Terence Davis | Robert Woodard II  SF: Barnes | Hield | Mo Harkless  PF: Metu | Bagley  C: Holmes | Len | TT | Damian Jones  Let's get the first issue out of the way. Their roster stinks. They have maybe 5 rotation-level players (Fox/Haliburton/Barnes/Holmes/Hield). But then what?  Davion Mitchell is an all-D, no-O rookie for now. Terence Davis has some scoring ability, but is rightfully stuck behind three decent guards and D Mitchell.  Mo Harkless has been a body at his recent stops. They've started Mo Harkless in 11 games. They started Chimezie Metu recently. Not saying either is bad bad, but would either even be getting playing time on most teams?  Alex Len has been hanging on in the league by a thread for a few years now and wouldn't be able to play onto most contenders' rosters. TT is washed (partially because of the direction the NBA took) and is a walking trade chip at this point.  Ramsey and Woodard would be two-ways at best on most teams. I don't think Damian Jones has ever been good, even when he was on the Warriors. And Bagley hardly plays.  You look at other mediocre rosters and they all either are clearly developmental (Rockets, Thunder) or they have at least 8-10 NBA level players on the roster, if not more.  The Warriors, Phoenix, Utah, Wizards, Nets, Bulls, Heat, Cavs, Bucks, 76ers, Hawks, Trail Blazers, Grizzlies, and Knicks all have a decent list of players who they can play who aren't complete liabilities (that's half the league, at least). Even for the 4-11 Spurs, you can point to 8 guys who should be on a contender's 10 man rotation (depending on positional excess). The Kings pretty much only have five rotation-quality players, and no amount of coaching will salvage that.  -----------  Their roster is talent-dry AND they don't enough have any assets worth a damn. They have +2 second rounders in total. That's it."
