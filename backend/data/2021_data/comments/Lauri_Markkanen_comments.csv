I could only see them going for Lauri Markkanen out of those.
"Read what I said - Markkanen is better OFFENSIVELY. Markkanen is the better scorer for sure, it's not even debatable based on his career numbers and current season numbers (and shooting splits). Lauri has avgd more assists through his career too. OG also has had competent playmaking guards like Lowry and FVV feed him. If Lauri played with a Trae Young or Lowry, his overall game would be way better too. He also has a much higher upside that OG offensively - 7-footer who shoots the 3 at a high clip on high volume while having decent athleticism for someone that size. OG is the better defender, but I wouldnt immediately say he's the better overall asset. He plays with Lowry, FVV, and Siakam, yet the bulls still have a better record - bulls have had a tougher schedule so far too  The PF/C isnt the most important position in NBA. Primary ballhandling wings/combo forwards like Lebron, Giannis, Kawhi, KD, Tatum run the league undoubtedly."

Lauri Markkanen. The performance he had against the knicks at MSG in his rookie year was incredible
"We have three.  White, Carter, Markkanen  White is trending down lately, carter was trending up, and Lauri changes with the wind that seems to be blowing sometimes (a lot of the time) when he shoots"
"Honestly Chicago Bulls. This team lacks of primary playmaker and also Ben should play point forward he can defend all 5 positions can switch to everybody. Chicago Bulls starting 5 is full of shooting specialists.   He can play 4 with Markkanen at the 5 and can cover Markkanen's lack of post defending and also he can play point guard for them and they can let White to be microwave scorer.  Garrett Temple, Zach Lavine, Patrick Williams/Otto Porter Jr, Ben Simmons, Lauri Markkanen five is balanced can be effective on both sides."
"Outside of Brogdon, I'm thinking about Lauri Markkanen, Zach Lavine, Aaron Gordon, Scary Terry, and Bradley Beal.  They bot peaked much imo but they was either underappreciated or simply overlooked."
"That's the thing, Shamet was a huge exception.  Top 3 3PM for rookies in 17-18:  1. Donovan Mitchell  2. Kyle Kuzma  3. Lauri Markkanen  18-19:  1. Luka Doncic  2. Landry Shamet  3. Trae Young  19-20:  1. Coby White  2. Kendrick Nunn  They're all volume shooter iso players besides Shamet. 3pt specialists just don't get that many shots as rookies."

"Lauri ""GOAT"" Markkanen."
"So as it turns out, winning basketball in Chicago is just getting Lauri Markkanen back"
"Yeah John Collins to a potential max itll be very interesting to see if Atl matches. It would create a massive payroll for an owner who's only paid the tax like twice and that was for like $2-3 mil over.   Thing with JC is he's not a 5, so playing him at a 4 its workable but it also doesnt provide as much flexibility especially if they keep DeRozan. This also might not be a bad Lauri Markkanen destination.   I dont think they want to go full on tanking. There enough of these Spencer Dinwiddie type FAs they could sign and I bet will try to to stay out of the bottom tier. I also think there is enough baseline talent here to prevent them from being a bottom feeder and theyll be able to draft more guys also. For DeRozan I bet if they offer like 3 yrs $70ish mil he would stay. Im not sure I would but that's probably what he would ask. Once LMA is gone, biggest goal is probably just finding the 5 to round things out and whether or not they believe that's Poeltl."
Watched the Bulls play against us and was impressed. Wanted to see more Bulls basketball. Sad Lauri Markkanen is not playing yet.
"Hey Bulls fans, where is Lauri Markkanen?"
"Harden played the KD warriors, Giannis played Kawhi and some rookies (and choked in a bad way).  Harden didn't make it further in the west, because that was a way tougher conference. Giannis beating the Magic in the first round every year isn't impressive to anyone besides Bucks fans.  And averaging 13 rebounds against elite centers like Lauri Markkanen is impressive, but I'll take the 36 ppg all time great scorer."
"Sure, let's say our guys were soft, and they didn't play defense. But is it also their fault that he basically filled up the whole roster with old Bulls who he signed for too much, was involved in negotiating Wiggins' contract hamstringing the rest of the team, traded Ricky Rubio for Jeff fucking Teague, and traded away Zach Lavine and Lauri Markkanen for one half-healthy volatile season with Jimmy? Nah. Fuck Tom Thibodeau"
"I humbly present two other MIP candidate submissions:  * **Lauri Markkanen** \- 17.3 PPG, 6.8 RPG, 1.3 APG, .8 SPG, 50% FG, 47.8% 3P (5.8 3PAPG) * **Coby White** \- 15.7 PPG, 5.4 APG, 4.7 RPG, 37.3% 3P (7.3 3PAPG), 86.4% FT"
Or a handful of month-long hot streaks from Lauri Markkanen
"I really love Satoransky, Temple, Porter, Williams, Markkanen kind of wing heavy 5's next to Lauri at center so far this season."
Lauri Markkanen
No hes not??? He gives up 70% at the rim on 17.5 Attempts per game. The only player with a comparable % on comparable attempts is Lauri fuckin Markkanen lol
"Zach LaVine is not on the trade block.  Lauri Markkanen is not on the trade block.  The second best player on the Bulls is Thaddeus Young, even though he's coming off the bench.  He may not be starting, but he's playing in the fourth quarter.  And he often plays just under 30 minutes per game, particularly in close games.    However, the Bulls are listening to offers for Young and may well trade him.  Or they may hold onto him in the hopes of getting the team some playoff experience. They really can't lose either way."
**2020:** Anthony Edwards with the 1st pick.   **2019:** Jarrett Culver with the 6th pick.   **2017:** Lauri Markkanen with the 7th pick (traded to the Bulls).   **2016:** Kris Dunn with the 5th pick.   **2015:** Karl-Anthony Towns with the 1st pick.   **2014:** Zach LaVine with the 13th pick.   **2013:** Trey Burke with the 9th pick (traded to the Jazz).   **2011:** Derrick Williams with the 2nd pick.   **2010:** Wesley Johnson with the 4th pick.  **2009:** Ricky Rubio with the 5th pick *and* Jonny Flynn with the 6th pick.   **2008:** OJ Mayo with the 3rd pick (traded to the Grizzlies).  **2007:** Corey Brewer with the 7th pick.   **2006:** Brandon Roy with the 6th pick (traded to the Blazers).
"Zach Lavine, Lauri Markkanen and Kris Dunn was hardly ""our entire future"". And it wouldn't have been one year if we hadn't signed Wiggins to the max."
"I had the same experience as you with Niko Mirotic in his annual March explosion and Lauri Markkanen in his similar February outbursts.   End of the day, both are just guesses anyway."
"Otto Porter Jr., Lauri Markkanen and Chandler Hutchison for the Bulls."
"As a Bulls fan, yes.  Maybe he could mentor Lauri Markkanen and possibly even start.  It would be nice to have hime as a future piece or a trade piece to help the Bulls team, get over the hump."
"Most Bulls fans have given up on Lauri Markkanen, but I think he's going to explode on another team where he fits better. He does get injured a lot, I will admit."
"Killian was the 7th overall pick in what many considered a weak draft.  If he ends up being a guy who averages 15/5/5 on 39% shooting and is a great passer with the ability to defend I am happy with it.  You can't ask for much more out of the 7th pick. You can see the list of 7th overall picks below:     * 2019: Coby White, Bulls. * 2018: Wendell Carter Jr., Bulls. * 2017: Lauri Markkanen, Timberwolves. * 2016: Jamal Murray, Nuggets. * 2015: Emmanuel Mudiay, Nuggets. * 2014: Julius Randle, Lakers. * 2013: Ben McLemore, Kings. * 2012: Harrison Barnes, Warriors"
It’s finally hit the Bulls sub but I want to see if it hit this one yet. Lauri Markkanen.
Small forward Lauri Markkanen really does not need to continue to be a thing
"**Jimmy Butler Trades:**  - Jimmy Butler, Justin Patton(CHI) FOR Zach LaVine, Kris Dunn, Lauri Markkanen(MIN)  - Jimmy Butler, Justin Patton(MIN) FOR Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Saric and a 2022 2nd round pick  The Wolves came in with good intentions but came out worse with both Butler trades"
I feel better than I did at the beginning of the season but worse then I was expecting after the trade deadline.   Favorite thing has hands down been watching Zach LaVine take another step towards greatness and Patrick Willams doing P Will things.   Most disappointing is the Bulls not living up to expectations and losing very winnable games. Most frustrating thing is Lauri Markkanen.   I’m hoping in the next couple of months we make some moves to make a splash next season and maybe taste the playoffs.   Personally very happy with our rookies. Sad to see Gafford go and WCJ but hopefully they thrive in a new environment.
"OKC is not getting hot lmao.   Lonzo Ball is interested.  McConnell and Caruso are interested.  Williams will improve.  Lauri will be gone so we might have someone to guard someone on the bench.  Get a point guard and no reason this team cant be a four seed the next two years. Or we can keep getting seven picks and drafting Lauri Markkanen, Coby White, Wendell Carter Junior for the next 10 years.  They had to do something.  This is better than standing pat."
"Lauri's injury history is longer, Isaac's injury history is worse. Lauri has had some back spasms early on, then ankle injures, then shoulder issues.  Isaac hyper-extended his knee, then torn his knee up and had to have surgery.  If you want to argue who's the better fit, but given Isaac's serious knee injury it's hard for a team to commit to him. He has potential, but Markkanen right now is a 17 ppg scorer who shoots very well. Even when he misses time consistently, it's better than a guy who just hasn't hit close to his potential because he's had multiple major knee injures."
"I like that we're pushing for the play-in. And this is the more popular decision for the players on the team.  Maybe Lauri Markkanen/Colby White or Kevin Knox, Bol Bol will become stars and joke will be on us though. lol"
I think it would make more sense for them to trade for a player already on a rookie contract where they own rights through RFA like a Lauri Markkanen not a star player  but a nice piece to o along with Shai. I guess it makes sense if they plan to build pieces around them. You see he hates it in Minny lol by the time his second contract comes around winning is probably more important than money at that point. He would be giving up the extra 1 year max but could easily make it up in a bigger market
Since the Pels can match and have all but said they want to keep him there. The bigger question is who would they prefer back in a sign Lauri Markkanen or Frank Ntilikina if Lonzo really wants to leave?

Big ass shotgun look like lauri markkanen
I like the Wolves as a stealth Lauri Markkanen destination.
Lauri Markkanen
Kyle and Markkanen should get married. Lauri Lowry
The Wolves traded Zach Lavine and Lauri Markkanen for this dude and 1 season of Jimmy Butler.
"For a 7th overall pick he's a bit disappointing. You expect a guy at 7th to be at the very least an alright starter.  2019: Coby White, Bulls.  2018: Wendell Carter Jr., Bulls.  2017: Lauri Markkanen, Timberwolves.  2016: Jamal Murray, Nuggets.  2015: Emmanuel Mudiay, Nuggets.  2014: Julius Randle, Lakers.  2013: Ben McLemore, Kings.  2012: Harrison Barnes, Warriors."
"Lauri has nice, pretty empty stats right now, which makes him expensive next year without being a good fit with the roster. I would trade him for a good-ish offer immediatly, but preferably to a team that is historically less competent, so chances are I don't look dumb by Markkanen being impactful for another team too soon."
Lauri Markkanen and Whiteside are going to be the best duo in the league
I think you should use it to S&amp;T for Lauri Markkanen this offseason
"Teams can't get away with having two slow bigs on the floor on defense because they get abused on switches, and on offense it's hard to play with two non-shooters.   ""Traditional"" power forwards can succeed at the 4 if these weaknesses are accounted for. Giannis is great at defending perimeter players, and on offense they have Brook Lopez to space the floor. Sabonis has spacing around him for days. Dudes like Julius Randle, Lauri Markkanen, and Dario Saric are knockdown shooters and good enough ball handlers so they fit well into modern offenses.  The PF position isn't dead, but those who can't shoot and/or defend the perimeter just get run off the court in the playoffs."

"If they manage to sign Lonzo this off-season then I could see them potentially taking the step up to the playoffs in the East.   Lonzo, LaVine, Williams, Markkanen, Vucevic   Satoransky, White, Brown Jr, Young, Theis.   A fair bit there does still depend on what happens with Lauri and if he can get back to his best. I wouldn't be opposed to Thad starting instead and letting Lauri try to feast on bench units."
&gt;That's your top 10 pick   So what? He's basically the same age as Markkanen and he doesn't have a slight bit more upside than Lauri.
Some people think Frank the Tank Kaminsky is better than Lauri Markkanen. This is 2021.
Breen is just *that* much of a total Knicks fans.  Sure national broadcasts are fun seeing the entire league but it's all about the Knicks for him.  It's even sweeter when he's with one of his favorite Knicks of all time.  Breen's wider view is great though when you have Clyde's hilariously bad habit of mispronouncing players names on occasion.  My man has 3 pronunciations for Lauri Markkanen.
"Forr the UFA maybe go for some or one of          Richaun Holmes, Nerlens Noel, Harry Giles, Cody Zeller, James Johnson, Otto Porter Jr          For the RFA which imo they are unlikely to sign         Lauri Markkanen, John Collins, Jarrett Allen, Duncan Robinson         Everytime I've watched the Spurs this year im always thinking man they need some more Interior Defense, Rebounding, and scoring from the big. Another path I think they can take is getting a shooter that is around 6'6 where imo Devin Vassell or even Keldon can mold into the PF spot as the never really played a traditional big at PF, it was usually Rudy/Demar and sometimes Lyles/Keldon. Outside of Jakob's defense his offensive game is abysmal and his backups are weak both defensively and offensively."
"Why not on Markkanen and Collins but on Portis? I mean, yeah we need a center too, but Jakob can easily still start for us and a bench big is easy to get. We also have Luka Samanic that plays PF and he's gonna develop and get minutes too. I would prolly still go Lauri Markkanen but if the Bulls wants ton of asset for him, well, Portis doesn't seem bad now that you made me think."
Lauri Markkanen is an NBA player I believe

Him and also Lauri Markkanen would be better 4 or 5 inches shorter
Lauri Markkanen
"I would guess they probably weren't offered anything worthwhile at the trade deadline.  Just because your probably not re-signing him if he gets an offer that's too high doesn't mean you should trade him for whatever you get offered.  For example, if the only offer was Lauri Markkanen (another RFA) straight up, then that just leaves you in a worse position."
Bro we didn't have Zach and TBJ. We played Lauri Markkanen at small forward.
The answer to that question is obviously not.   I watched Lauri Markkanen tear him up this year.

Pokus ceiling is just an improved Lauri Markkanen
"ironic considering the Bulls have Lauri Markkanen, who is 7 feet tall but plays like he's my height"
"He was hyped up because ~~of his potential. We all thought he’d realize he’s a 7 fter and start getting rebounds, defending the paint, and be more than a giant spot up shooter. He’s fine as a player and all that but his contract puts a target on his back, as well.~~  ~~Right now he’s just the rich mans lauri markkanen.~~  *-he was on the Knicks*  FTFY"
I watched Lauri Markkanen destroy him this year.  All the proof I need.
"He was hyped up because of his potential. We all thought he’d realize he’s a 7 fter and start getting rebounds, defending the paint, and be more than a giant spot up shooter. He’s fine as a player and all that but his contract puts a target on his back, as well.  Right now he’s just the rich mans lauri markkanen."
Ben Wallace is the most overrated player in NBA history Lebron hunts stats for his legacy  My other two were Coby White and Lauri Markkanen are not good basketball players.....but it went from 90/10 getting pissed to 90/10 agree.
"There was a stretch in Tatum’s second year, when the consensus on this sub was that Lauri Markkanen was obviously better than him. And that was after he lead a team to ECF as a rookie. Crazy times."
Coby White and Lauri Markkanen
No.  He got outplayed by Lauri markkanen.   He is averaging about 5ppg his last 5 games and does nothing but stand on the three point line and jack threes.    Porzinges is equally frustrating
"Lauri Markkanen is so bad. I find myself transfixed when hes on the court because he just runs around doing absolutely nothing.  anyway, i really like the Bulls commentators. Hopefully they'll have a decent team to watch soon."
Lauri Markkanen freakin sucks
Wolves say no. Lauri Markkanen isn’t worth a lottery pick.
"It's fine Sixers fans! You need shooting? We got a slightly used Lauri Markkanen aka ""the white Porzingis"" who we can give you just for the very fair price of one Ben Simmons!"
Lauri Markkanen.
Came up with White Death for Lauri Markkanen during his Arizona days
Sounds like you guys are looking for a Lauri Markkanen more than a KP. Lauri is a very good shooting big who needs someone to find him his shots. Lauri won’t demand the ball and from time to time he will pull some moves out take his man off the dribble. Sounds like a much better fit
"Zach Lavine, Patrick Williams, Lauri Markkanen, Coby White, Lebron James  Lebron instead of Vucevic cuz Vuc has proven he can be a championship number 1, Lebron can’t anymore needs AD"
"Assuming we get a decent first and some good seconds, I wouldn't really mind that. Our realistic best option in free agency this year is Lauri Markkanen which probably wouldn't work out great. Kemba's only under contract 2 more years and the only player whose contract ends in 2022 is Lonnie and he should be cheap or we let him walk. It would mean us letting Patty walk or basically not playing him which would be sad though. Biggest problem is we're already guard heavy and getting Kemba means we would basically always have a small guard on the court.  The spurs front office basically always does nothing though so I expect us to overpay some okay dudes and that be our offseason."
Those are Lauri Markkanen numbers.
"Don't worry mavs fans, Lauri Markkanen is coming to the rescue"
"don't worry mavs fans, lauri markkanen is coming to the rescue"
Not that I know of. Most random name drop I heard is Lauri Markkanen in Bloxk Party.
Seeing this and the fact that the Bulls new front office didnt resign lauri markkanen feels so good.
Don’t forget Lauri Markkanen and Patrick Williams on the east
Knowing the Mavs probably Lauri Markkanen
Harden best ever 1v1 chuck?   Lol okay ***Lauri Markkanen has entered the chat***
"Literally not even close, John Collins is like Lauri Markkanen 2.0"
"I’ll raise you one Lauri Markkanen and Nikola Vucevic. I love Vucevic but he’s so bad defensively, half the time he doesn’t even put his hand up to at least look like he’s trying."
The Lauri markkanen special
Lauri Markkanen with a max contract
Lauri Markkanen has been fucking terrible in this game.
"I remember him going off a couple of times and Mavs fans talking their shit so I just assumed he’s usually better than this.. dude needs to go if the Mavs lose this series, idk who is taking him though. He’s essentially Lauri Markkanen but a little better."
Lauri Markkanen
Somebody give us a late 20s first for Lauri Markkanen.
"It's unreal. His play against Markkanen where he gets round the screen and gets a hand over the ball as Lauri shoots, then runs back from out of frame to get the intercept when he tries to pass was one of the most insane defensive plays I've ever seen."
"I remember a game where the Bucks were destroying the bulls and there was a loose ball, Markkanen just looks at it and Arch is on the ground immediately.  That was the moment I lost all hope for Lauri.  If you could just put Archie's heart in that giant Finn, we'd have a star, lol."
"some bulls fans just like to shit on our players. lauri is a bad defender, especially against stronger players (though you can switch him on guards and he'll stay with most of them), he's got terrible rebounding instincts and he has trouble finishing in traffic, but calling him a catch and shoot guy is idiotic. that's how that moron jim boylen used him, and that's how he was used in billy donovan's offense AND HE SUCKED. he sucked terribly when he was put in a role of a spot-up shooter. cause that's not what he is.  he's been really good at the beginning of this year before the shoulder injury, and he's been good in fred hoiberg's offense. cause they used him in a better way. markkanen is best used as a player who is heavily involved in creating offense, primarily by setting off-ball picks in the nail area, receiving the ball and then driving towards the basket cause he has elite speed for his size and a really good first step. he can play some pick and pop, and some pick and roll, even though he's not elite at those aspects of the game. but when you engage him in your offense as an active player and draw plays for him he can be an excellent second or third option, depending on the quality of the team. and those players don't grow on trees.  but people are often focused on negatives, and more often delete context from their evaluations. and the context is that markkanen is a young guy who had a whole year of development wasted by the worst coach in franchise histroy, who plays mostly in a system that doesn't fit them, and had to play injured for a long time. with addition of vooch he's superfluous for the bulls, and he has to go, but he'll be good for a scheme heavy team that will be able to use him."
**PG:** Luka Doncic   **SG:** Maxi Kleber   **SF:** Lauri Markkanen  **PF:** Kristaps Porzingis   **C:** Boban Marjanovic
I would like Lauri Markkanen to develop
The mavs would like to request that a better player than lauri markkanen expresses interest in joing our team
"Lauri ""Earl Thomas"" Markkanen"
"The Bulls have a habit of sending their bigs out into the world to fuck shit up, we go through them so quickly. Taj Gibson, Joakim Noah, Omer Asik, Threekola Mirotic, Bobby Portis, Wendell Carter Jr., Daniel Gafford. Next in line is Lauri Markkanen."
Don’t think lauri markkanen will be back. Does really fit and has a couple bad years
"Lauri Markkanen. I was wrong, obv."
"Don't expansion teams automatically get the top pick in the draft? Like Seattle gets #1, Vegas gets #2, then Vegas picks first from the player pool?   If you're Seattle and you go in knowing you have Cade, that changes things dramatically. I also think you focus on free agency (you have crazy money to work with, starting from scratch) and use the expansion draft to round it out.   I'd get Cade, then pursue solid guys in free agency who I know are probably going to go for the bag, or young guys you could overpay and gamble on. Guys like Otto Porter Jr, Tim Hardaway Jr, Cody Zeller, Doug McDermott, Lauri Markkanen, Malik Monk.   Then in the expansion draft add Winslow, Thompson, Okogie, Okpala, Holiday, Arcidiacono  Cade/Payton/Arcidiacono  Monk/A. Holiday/Okogie  Hardaway/Porter/Winslow  Markkanen/McDermott/Melli  Zeller/Thompson/Okpala  I think this team has a good balance of young guys and vets, it makes up for a lack of star power with depth, it'll be about as competitive as an expansion team can be.  Good spacing, good size, nobody too old."
His 3pt volume would probably be a lot higher and he'd probably average 23ppg or so.  Hard to come up w/ an exact comparison... maybe lauri markkanen?  Maybe borderline all-star in the east.
"He was grossly under-utilized on the Bulls in favor of trying to develop Wendell Carter Jr and Lauri Markkanen as the primary bigs. The irony being neither of those two guys will be on the team next season anyway.  Glad to see he's getting the minutes he deserves in Washington, I'm always rooting for former Bulls to be successful."
Lauri Markkanen got next lol
"Lauri ""Finnish Davis ""Latvian Lazer"" Bertans"" Markkanen"
"What do you mean exposed on the perimeter? His ISO defense numbers were good. And I certainly can't remember instances when he was haunted by opposition guards, like it sometimes happens right now when he can't move anymore.  He obviously had issue on defense, he wasn't perfect lol. His foot speed was really good for a 7'3 guy, but he still couldn't keep up with quicker guards, so he usually just gave away space for them to shoot a semi-contested jumper by backing up, but even when he got blown by he often could recover with his length and decent lateral movement.  His fundamentals weren't great. He was getting caught ball watching or just sleeping quite often.  And probably his main issue - over-helping. He was so focused on paint defense, that his guy usually got a ton of open threes. All those Lauri Markkanen games when Lauri just hit 7 or 8 open threes and people were screaming how he cooked him when KP was covering up for other guys being blown by. Could he do a better job by recovering or managing instances when he should've helped - sure. But again, our personal was always god awful so I don't know why we should've been a top10 defense in any of those years. He is not Gobert, lol."
"i copied it if anybody wants it:  #I like to fall asleep to Bill Simmon’s podcasts only for his s\*\*t takes to send me into a spiral the following day.  I live downtown in a major city right by a large highway and god damn does it get noisy. One night I notice that as I’m listening to a Bill Simmon’s podcast, I start to get ridiculously tired. It’s like Bill Simmon’s takes are so awful that they somehow don’t register in my mind. My brain just ops into replacing the I-405 background noise with how the Celtics should have won the championship in 11 out of the last 10 years.  All of a sudden instead of hearing semis and the homeless guy outside my window using my patio as a toilet, I hear these sweet unrealistic lullabies about how the Trail Blazers actually have a shot, and that Dame can be the #1 option on a title contender.  Cool cool.  So anyways, I wake up feeling great and later in the day I’m talking to my co-workers about how Dame is the guy and we’re going to the finals (obviously this ended up being SO wrong). Life’s good and I start poppin my nightly 9PM melatonin with a healthy dose of Bill and maybe a sprinkle of Kevin O’Connor here and there.   Fast forward a couple weeks and I notice that hot takes are starting to intrusively enter my thoughts without a moments notice. One minute I’m on the job talking with a patient, and boom! I can’t stop thinking about how Bill said he would trade Embiid for Lauri Markkanen and WCJ straight up. HE REALLY SAID THAT. All of a sudden I’m sweating and can’t think straight. I end up taking an early lunch.  Then the other night, I’m out on a date. Everything’s going well and we’re having a great time over drinks. Then about two hours in, I blurt out that Maya Moore could have been the 8th man on an NBA team. All I can think is “what am I saying, that’s the worst take ever”. Luckily she has no idea who Maya is and I explain to her that’s she’s one of the greatest WNBA players of all time. She ends up loving it and goes on about the gender inequalities occurring in sports, all of which are true. But we all know there’s no way Maya could have kept up with anyone in the league. The White Mamba would have made her look like a middle school bench player. Anyways, I’m thinking nice, great recovery dude. But then I blurt out that James Wiseman for JJJ is a fair trade. WHAT! At this point I can’t control myself, and she’s looking at me all confused like “how did this become the topic”. I tell her I need to use the restroom. After 30 minutes in there, I return and tell her I’m not feeling well. What a waste of a perfectly good night!  Heather if you’re reading this, I apologize. I meant it when I said that your Watermelon blazer was cute af and I really wish we could have gone on a date to that Storm game. Bill if you’re reading this, I need you to know that I fully understand why you need to say such ridiculous takes. Business is business. But PLEASE, put up a disclaimer or warning in your videos. The people need to know the ramifications of listening to such burning hot garbage takes."

That Lauri Markkanen was going to be a star.
"John Collins- Hawks, they’ll likely match whatever, and it’s better to have an asset than not to, some team would trade for his max contract  Lonzo Ball- Chicago, the fit makes a lot of the sense the bulls can sell him the idea of a fresh start and being the lead decision maker instead of sharing the court with Eric Bledsoe lol  Lauri Markkanen- San Antonio, they need a 4 man, spacing and Lauri is European what more is there to say?  Ntilikina- Denver, not sure on their salary situation but they get another bench/ 3rd string  combo guard that can come in, play play defense and compete for minutes with Facu and Dozier while Murray is out.   Malik Monk- Charlotte, the Kentucky fan in me wants to see him with Fox in Sacramento but he’s in a good place playing with LaMelo and Hayward. I think he has another gear to reach especially if they let Graham walk and give him more opportunity.   Zach Collins-Phoenix, The suns have a need for a backup big they took Jalen Smith last year but having options is always good. When healthy (if that’s even a thing) Collins has shown an impactful and versatile skillset on both ends of the floor which is something they were looking to add by looking at the smith pick.   Jarrett Allen- Cleveland, similar to Atlanta Allen is an asset. Even if they draft Mobley holding onto Allen and being able to weight the options between trading him or playing him with Mobley is better than losing him in free agency.    Josh Hart- i would say Detroit but he already laughed that off when asked before. I’ll go Knicks he seems like a thibs guy, can play defense, crash the glass and make a play."
I don’t watch any Bulls games - what happened to Lauri Markkanen?

Lauri Markkanen for AD
Breakout: Lauri Markkanen after he plays under Pop next year
So I did a 2k rebuild and this is how I won a championship.  Did a sign and trade with lauri markkanen for Dejounte Murray.  Signed Drose and Doug McDermott to a 1 year deal.  Bulls made 2nd round and lost in 6   The following free agency sign Lavine and KD and won it all lol
LAURI MARKKANEN
Lauri Markkanen if he lands in the right place
How about Lauri markkanen.   He's 7ft and shot 40% from 3 last season. Great fit next to Poeltl.
Markkanen. Kuzma is 4 years older and still not better than a 5-7th man. Lauri might get somewhat better.
"Bulls are up there...  This is their current guaranteed roster:  Nikola Vucevic ($24,000,000) Zach LaVine ($19,500,000) Al-Farouq Aminu ($10,183,800) Patrick Williams ($7,422,000) Thaddeus Young ($6,000,000) Coby White ($5,837,760) Troy Brown ($5,170,564) Tomas Satoransky ($5,000,000)  And then Lauri Markkanen ($9,026,852 qualifying offer / $20,194,524 cap hold)  That’s basically the cap and they went 12-17 after the Vuc trade. He’s 30 and they have him on the books for two more years. They traded what became the 8th pick for him, along with Wendell Carter Jr., and their 2023 pick.  What do they do to get better? How do they become a high caliber team? Maybe Lauri and Lavine make a leap. I sure hope so, I’m rooting for them."
"Low-key, Lauri Markkanen. Hopefully he can get/stay healthy and get into a system where he isn't just a spot up guy, but he's got a lot of high level offensive skills. Heck he was even doing some pnr ballhandling at Arizona."
There's more to protecting the paint than shot blocking. He doesn't have enough muscle to be able to battle with anybody in the NBA. Dude would get wrecked even by skinnier guys like Lauri Markkanen.
Coby White + Lauri Markkanen + Satoransky/Thaddeus Young + 2nd round pick(s)
"Bobby Portis for example, before his contract was up we reportedly tried to extend him ""for a multi-year deal worth 40-50 million"" but he turned it down. At the time we had just drafted Lauri Markkanen and didn't want to spend any more money than that at the power forward position so we ended up trading him before he walked for nothing.  So it's not like he wasn't good enough for us to offer him a second contract, they just couldn't agree on the money."
Lauri Markkanen was so good on Chicago that Bobby Portis didn't even get a chance. :)
I think it'll be a big from a team in the East. My bet is Myles Turner if its straight up or Lauri Markkanen plus pick swap with the Bulls if GSW can't get much value for Wiseman.
"Lauri Markkanen, great fit at the stretch 5 on a team that needs shooting."
"As a TRUE Portland Trail Blazers fan, I speak for ALL of us when I say that it’s time for us to TRADE Damian Lillard. He can’t get it done. We need a true winner.    Trade Dame to Chicago for LAURI MARKKANEN: a proven winner in college and the pros. BYE BYE LAME TIME!"
Playing Lauri Markkanen at small forward (he's clearly a shooting guard)
Lauri Markkanen and not even a question
I thought for sure that Lauri Markkanen would surpass Dirk for the best shooting/lumbering PF of all time. In my defense I was right about one of those words though.

Just to talked about someone else for two seconds. Lauri Markkanen is a small forward.
"I would like to see Chicago Bulls make an offer if he’s available. They need playmaking, forwards next to Lavine and Vucevic, Simmons is both. They already traded for Vucevic make another splash and get Lavine in the postseason  Not sure if they have stuff that 76ers benefits but S&amp;T Lauri Markkanen and Coby White is on the table.

"I know it's not great, but we will give Coby White, Troy Brown Jr, Lauri Markkanen, and 2 pick swaps for Ben Simmons. Thanks!"
"I'd give an edge to KAT over Vuc (both have great offensive games and troubling defense, with age going in KATs favor) but I'd give a bigger edge to Lavine over Edwards.  Some players have great rookie seasons but go on to disappointing overall careers, while Lavine has such an amazing work ethic combined with his insane athletic gifts heading into his prime with the best team ever assembled around him.  I'm more confident that Lavine will reach a higher level han his '20-'21 season than I am that Edwards will ever reach Lavine's '20-'21 season contribution, if that makes any sense.  There's a lot more runway as a rising sophomore for Edwards to chase his potential, but its somewhat rare that a player puts in the work to go from great to that next level above.  Judging just from stats (so I will admit that I haven't watched hours of KAT tape), KAT hasn't really improved much since his sophomore season.  Other players that looked to have very promising trajectories early on that have not substantially improved upon their first couple of seasons: Ben Simmons, Lauri Markkanen, MCW, Wiggins, etc."
"They’ve tried hard to sign non white stars and no one is interested in coming here. We swung and missed on Lowry, Butler, Beal, Kemba, Dwight Howard, Giannis, Kawhi, DeRozan, Conley, Grant, etc…   I don’t think it’s a conscious choice, we are signing players who are interested in playing with us, most of them want to play with Luka (Goran Dragic, fellow country man) or Lauri Markkanen who expressed interest in playing here. If Bradley Beal or Lowry had wanted to play here we 100% would’ve signed them."

&gt; What we lose on defense we add up on scoring and spacing with Lauri  Kleber has the same career 3p% as Markkanen and shot 41% last season  &gt; he has a significantly more value than Maxi  If that was the case then how come no one has traded for him and why are all the rumors about the market cooling on him?
Lauri Markkanen with #2 dedicated looks would easily put up 23/9 on 60%TS+

Lauri Markkanen
Call me a homer but I see a scenario where Lauri Markkanen averages 23-26 pts
"Taurean prince, Denzel valentine, Markelle fultz, lauri markkanen, Dennis Smith Jr, marvin bagley, Kevin knox. That's my list of guys that were hyped but either have had bad injury luck or don't know what the hell is going on."
Oh shit I didn't actually scroll to the end of the article. Yeah thats fucking whack. Lauri Markkanen gets a mention over RJ thats cray.
"Sure but to not even make the honorable mention??? That's kinda crazy to believe. Feels like a conspiracy at this point.  &gt;The other players who received votes for this exercise but just missed the cut to make the Top 25 are OG Anunoby (Toronto), Tyrese Haliburton (Sacramento), Lauri Markkanen (Chicago), De’Andre Hunter (Atlanta), Malik Beasley (Minnesota), Immanuel Quickley (New York) and Jalen Brunson (Dallas)."
"Interesting topic. But I don't see how a player on a max contract can be considered underrated.  My answer is Lauri Markkanen, who ought to have been signed by now for a lot more money that he's going to end up getting. He has his flaws. But 7-footers who can shoot from deep and score efficiently are a rare commodity. Especially with Markkanen entering his age-24 season."
"With all due respect, Chicago is off his mind if they think they can get both a FRP and no salaries back for a guy that stats are dipping and went to the media to say, with every word, that he does not want to be there.  ""Ay, but he is obliged to stay, he will play"". This is the NBA. If he wants to sit with a pout throughout the season, he will still get a 4Y/40-45M rebound contract. If he plays, unless he becomes SMOTY, playing behind DeRozan won't get him much more. Lauri will be a terrible locker room presence, and Chicago wants just a dip under what they paid for DeRozan.   They dished FRPs like candy and now wants to find a moron that will overpay Markkanen and let them recoup some assets. I can see they netting a FRP taking salary back, or trading for a 2nd and some team's TPE/MLE (is there any team with their MLE left?). Both? They will have a Finnish bomb at their locker room, due to pure pettiness."
"Exactly. MPJ is an elite play finisher, but Murray is way ahead of him in other aspects of the game like playmaking.   MPJ had one of the worst assist percentages in the league last year at 5.2%, good for 487th in the league.  For reference, the two players immediately ahead of him are Willie Cauley-Stein and Taj Gibson, and those right below him are Lauri Markkanen and Daniel Gafford.  To compare, before the injury Murray was 111th at 19.7%. Other similar shotmaking wings also rank a lot higher, like Tatum (113th, 19.6%), PG13 (67th, 23.9%), Brandon Ingram (87th, 21.8%).  On top of that, 79.2% of his made shots were assisted on. Other elite wings can create for themselves much more reliably, which is a huge part of being a top option.   To compare again: Murray (41.8%), Tatum (40.8%), PG13 (42.9%), Ingram (48.5%)  He's gonna be elite as a shotmaker, but to really be a 1B type guy he needs to make some big, big strides in other areas of his game, like playmaking and creating his own shot vs. it being created for him."
"Pretty sure they mean as opposed to doing a sign-and-trade, which *would* hard-cap us. The line before that is about Lauri Markkanen."
i for one would be totally cool with no more reports on which teams are “interested” in lauri markkanen
"They do want him gone. They don't want him gone so badly that they're going to give up the multiple picks/decent players it would take to get another team to absorb his enormous contract, but don't mistake that for them not wanting to offload him.  Porzingis is a fine player, in the same way that Lauri is a fine player, in an extremely limited role. But in the same way that nobody wants to pay Markkanen more than $10m a year, nobody is looking to pay $34m a year to a guy who can't defend anymore, refuses to post up smaller players and has missed 26% of all possible games over the past 5 seasons."
"Because this year matters?  Clearly the Bulls plan a is to get a decent return for him in a trade. But if the offer doesn't meet their expectations then they still need a backup 4 and Lauri is probably better than any remaining FA for that role, so if they plan to make the playoffs after trading 3 first round picks, Thad Young, Daniel Theis and Satoransky in the past 6 months, then they're better off with Markkanen on the bench than a future second round pick."
this was when lauri markkanen was seen as the second coming of dirk nowitzki and our franchise player moving forward … how have times changed
"Sure, this is a basketball story, but at its core it's a human story.  Born in Vantaa, Finland, on May 22 1997, Lauri Markkanen was destined to become a professional basketball player. His father knew he had the right stuff from an early age, describing young Lauri as a gym rat -- a real lunch pail guy -- and deceptively fast.   His mother claimed that on the day Lauri was born, the doctors said that he had a lot of heart for a newborn and he was sneaky athletic. In fact, he was so scrappy that when the doctor smacked his bottom, Lauri threw an elbow into his temple, and then stood over him as he lay motionless on the ground.  So we're all definitely excited to see what Lauri can get up to with the Dallas Mavericks, we'll be watching, and most of all, we'll all be keeping an eye out for any bruises are cuts given Mavericks coach Jason Kidd's penchant for mercilessly beating anyone named Lauri."
"Thank you for explaining because that had me confused.   *""Teams X, Y, and Z are salivating over Lauri Markkanen. Would love to have him...Bulls are in a great position because the market has dried up""* Buh-wha??"
"As a Dallas fan I hope Lauri doesn’t stay with you and comes to us. Our potential bench unit squad would be: Dragic (i have a good feeling that he’s coming), Brunson, Sterling Brown, Markkanen, Kleber.  3 guys which could easily score 15+ points, plus Brown and Kleber as elite 3 point shooters/decent defenders. We also got Moses Brown in the Richardson trade (maybe he could also become a solid bench unit option)."

Thad is exactly what this team needs right now. Dammit Lauri..."
"And more….  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  • Latest free agency and trade news and buzz • Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move • Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this • NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next • Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
Josh Hart is like a 6'10 guy in a 6'4 body. Lauri Markkanen is the opposite
Save some space here for Lauri markkanen. He turned down an extension last year and is most probably headed for QO
why the hell would we want Lauri Markkanen
"&gt; His girlfriend convinced to go vegan and he even himself admitted later that it made him injury prone and not that energetic  He never went vegan and he did the opposite of admitting his diet was related to his injuries:  ""Markkanen, who still eats chicken and fish""    “It wasn’t because of my diet because I was doing this diet a long time before that (heart incident),” Markkanen said in a recent interview. “I have a chef. He makes sure I get the right amount of protein.”   https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/bulls/bulls-lauri-markkanen-content-diet-one-year-removed-heart-scare"
"Lauri Markkanen, MPJ, Garland, Maxey (I think that thybulle is already really good), the guy who plays in Portland and his name starts with a S (Simone?), Graham, Monk and Bridges x 2"
Shams reported that it was Bulls who pulled Markkanen off the Spurs deal and now it's reported they want a first round pick in S&amp;T for Lauri.
I'm going to be pissed if the mavs waste a first round pick on lauri fucking markkanen. trade 1st round picks for someone at least worth something.
"Honest question, is there a time limit on how long Lauri can go without signing somewhere before the QO expires? If not I feel like we're gonna hear about potential Markkanen sign and trade proposals through September."
burn bridges with agencies...?  Do you know who Lauri Markkanen is/who represents him...?
"1. Chicago’s front office is completely different from two years ago.  2. Lauri Markkanen wanted to play hard ball and ask for somewhere close to 20 million. The Bulls didn’t want that so that’s why this didn’t happen.  3. Clearly, no other team wants to pay him 20 million. That’s why he’s being linked closer to 15 million a year.   4. Lauri never requested a trade two years ago. So I’m not sure where you’re getting the information that he wanted to be traded two years ago. Link me to an article about that.  5. The Bulls owe Lauri nothing, especially after the way he acted when he got benched."
"&gt; Either way, each team that has inquired about Markkanen would have to now add him via sign-and-trade, as cap space has dwindled across the league. Dallas, New Orleans, Boston, and Minnesota have all shown interest in signing Markkanen to deals worth around $15 million in average annual value, sources said, but the Bulls are seeking a first-round pick in exchange for helping facilitate the transaction. Additionally, Chicago brass are requiring Markkanen's new team to find a third trade partner to take on the outgoing salary needed to create space for Markkanen's contract.   &gt; For a third team to take on unwanted salary, this hypothetical front office would also ask for draft-pick compensation. So any team that wants to add Markkanen now would have to send a first-round pick to Chicago and likely another first or two second-rounders elsewhere. It's a clear roadblock the Bulls seem to have intentionally created.   Sounds like other teams are trying to toss their shitty contracts at us while trying to get Lauri for free.  And AKME are not having any bit of that nonsense.   Good in them.  Just hope this clears up sooner than later.  I really do not want Lauri with his weak D on this team."
I think the bench would look nice with Lauri.   Clear offensive focal points with White and Markkanen and three defense first guys.   Alex Caruso Coby White Troy Brown Jr Lauri Markkanen Tony Bradley
He's so much tougher than markkanen.. hes a dawh whole lauri is a pussy
&gt;~~Dennis Schroder~~  Lauri markkanen! Ftfy
"What they’ll have is an unhappy Markkanen, and if that’s the best they can do, that’s the best they can do. But the player they *need* is a happy Lauri, or Lauri-like player. Maybe they can secure that kind of player (too bad they traded away Thad Young) by trading Lauri away after December, but those first few months will be rough."
"Luka Doncic, Goran Dragic, Maxi Kleber, Lauri Markkanen, Kristaps Porzingis with Boban Marjanovic as the sixth man. Cuban has clocked his game."
"Cuban is turning into Jerry Jones before our eyes.  Title should read ""Mavs have strong interest in acquiring Lauri Markkanen if all they have to trade is shitty overpaid negative value players like Dwight Powell and Trey Burke.""  Same as the Cowboys in free agency every year having interest in players that sign bargain basement contracts."
The Lauri Markkanen saga just got more...saga-y
Think I would rather have lauri markkanen if his salary would fit. Not sure on the details there.
"Bulls circlejerk is pretty deep. Lauri could have definitely played better, and this definitely was not because of ”no ball in his hands”. The reason he was benched was not because he is a terrible defender. He was primarily benched bc Vuc is a terrible defender. Their play together did not mesh at all. Then his value tanked.   Bulls reddit is in a collective frenzy. Markkanen - like Cam Payne, Bobby Portis, Wendell Carter etc. - is going to thrive somewhere else. Some other team is going to get him cheap and that is a good outcome."
"Timberwolves:  Jarred Vanderbilt is extremely replaceable and not worth $5 million a year.  Jarrett Culver should be ahead of Josh Okogie in the rotation because he has more upside on offense.  A team can never have enough offense, so signing Lauri Markkanen to a deal worth $15-$18 million a year isn't a terrible idea.  If we don't get a PF, Nathan Knight should start at C while KAT moves to PF.  Naz Reid is best suited for a bench role."
"Basically it comes down to is Markkanen the guy the Thunder want to take on and sacrifice our flexibility. It’s definitely enticing because I’m fairly confident we could reform him and potentially see him really thrive and grow in our system. It’s a little iffy tho, there mig be more value in remaining available to take on bad contracts from other teams looking to get off bad money for more assets. Also don’t really think Lauri fits our timeline. As a fan, I’d love to see it. The thought of Lauri balling out with SGA, Poku, Giddey &amp; gang is so exciting. From an executive point of view, idk if it’s right for us."
"Lauri ""The Next Dirk"" Markkanen"
"Markkanen said today to Finnish media that he has got offers from different teams:  Lauri Markkanen, who has represented the Chicago Bulls for four seasons, revealed to Yle Urheilu on Friday that he hopes his career will continue somewhere other than the Chicago club.  Bulls ’offer of about $ 9 million on the last day of July made the 213-cent Markka a limited free agent.  The contract offer guarantees that Bulls has the right to respond to an offer made by another team or to try to arrange a contract in which it will trade Markkanen to another team.  The NBA free agent market opened last Monday.  - We have offers from several different teams. I want a fresh start to my NBA career somewhere else. Hopefully things will be sorted out quickly with the Bulls and a new direction for my career, Lauri Markkanen told Yle Urheilu.  During the four seasons, Markkanen has played in the Bulls shirt in 222 matches. During these seasons, the Finn scored 15.6 points for the Chicago club and tore 7.1 rebounds per match."
"I wonder if anyone will give Frankie Nicotine a flyer. I think Boogie, JJ and Millsap all have something left in the tank. Biyombo is a solid rim protector as a backup still. Who wins the Lauri Markkanen sweepstakes? Does Josh Hart end up taking the qualifying? These questions and more on next week's episode of NBA off-season"
"Lauri Markkanen is really good, he just needs to work on defense, rebounding, leadership, toughness, playmaking, switches, screens, rim-protecting, and his post moves."
"Technically, OKC does not have cap space. They have $50 million worth of TPEs, which count against the cap. They could rescind those, but they’d lose some flexibility if they did that. I think the Thunder are going to work a trade in the next few days to make use of the big TPE that expires Monday. That could involve Markkanen. Hell, it could involve expanding the Lonzo Ball S&amp;T to include a Lauri S&amp;T to OKC, where OKC also takes Aminu’s contract."
Lauri “Earl Thomas” Markkanen
"I don't think you do - they're already in the tax. There is a hard cap triggered by a sign and trade that you cannot go over. The league will not approve any move that puts you over the apron. Lauri markkanen - although underrated, is not worth the headache it would cause for LA having to make cap space available (already) and signing a deal that Chi won't match."
Perfect fit? Bro have you watched one game of Lauri Markkanen?  How is Ryan Anderson 2.0 a fit next to KAT lol
Warriors can get a TPE out of this and RIP Lauri Markkanen
Can we sign and trade him and Stanley Johnson for lauri markkanen?!? Pretty please 🙏
Maybe this will happen to Lauri markkanen some day. Maybe he goes to Europe. Maybe he matches Doug McDermott.  Hardly to find out if he stays with bulls I'm thinking it's europe.
"The Charlotte Hornets have ""strong interest"" in restricted free agent Lauri Markkanen, according to [Shams Charania](https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1423374785992613890) of Stadium and The Athletic.  The 24-year-old can sign an offer sheet "
One Lauri markkanen comin right up!!
That's certainly one reaction to trying to acquire Lauri Markkanen
Still showing more improvement than Lauri Markkanen has since his rookie year though
"The best offer at the deadline was lauri Markkanen who was on an expiring and not someone we would resign. So we’d be sitting here right now with exactly nothing right now.   Also, I’m not sure it’s a great idea to force someone to play here for that amount of money and basically waste half a season. Trust me we’ve tried (eric Gordon, eric Bledsoe, AD’s last year) if a guy doesn’t want to be here it’s best to move on."
"In short, the reality of the offseason is much better than the perception, but the perception is also pretty bad and it will take the Pelicans being able to take advantage of the considerable flexibility they've afforded themselves to change the minds of many.  After making good moves by recognizing the mistakes of last offseason, overhauling the coaching staff, and clearing the decks with the Memphis trade, they took a shot at the top veteran point guards on the market, made big offers to Lowry and then Paul, and they were turned down. Then they went after guys like THJ and Powell to add more shooting and a solid veteran starter to the lineup and they both chose to stay with their current teams. After doing so, they seem to be set on operating as an above the cap team, which is why they’ve been bringing in guys by sign and trade. Thus it is highly unlikely the book has been written on the Pelicans offseason, but if you stopped the story right now the first few chapters might give you cause for concern.  But, I'm fairly confident they will add several more players with the flexibility that their moves has afforded them, and when the totality of moves are made, things will look far better even if the general consensus of fans has been crystallized by  what has happened solely in the past few days.   That is the gist, but if curious, what follows if much more detailed:  I can understand the disappointment and frustration of many Pelicans fans, and skepticism of fans around the league. I also get the criticism in the media, both the valid and hyperbolic, especially when the media (particularly the hot take variety) has a bias towards larger markets, a desire to see young superstars on “name” teams, as well as the with Pelicans/Hornets past failures to build winners around CP3/AD, and given the mistakes of last offseason and what it cost to undo them this year. It also does not help that their primary target was also the top (reasonably gettable) guy on the market this year, fans got their hopes up, and when they took a big swing for the home run and missed, then followed that up with not matching Lonzo, and then Pels fans only see backups from Chicago and Charlotte coming in and are critical or worried. And If this were the sum total of the Pelicans offseason, I would probably agree with them, especially if there were no more moves made (there will be several). But as it stands now they are in position to be a better performing team this year than last, and have much improved finances/books, hold no bad contracts, and have a ton of flexibility to fill several more spots for this years team.   On Lonzo, they seem to have decided (correctly imo) that he was not worth the price Chicago paid, though even if it were marginally lower they probably don’t match and force Ball to stay. I completely understand the reasoning of why many would disagree and say just match, and I think it was a closer call than the front office did, but ultimately at that number and given Lonzo’s preference to leave (along with the terrible experience of forcing Eric Gordon to stay and underperform years ago) I agree with letting him go. They felt that Lonzo was not the answer at point, and that he’s really more of a 3/D guard and that they could find either a star level veteran floor leader, or a cheaper option that could actually run the half court, drive the ball, and wasn’t afraid to draw fouls. They struck out on the veteran, but were able to acquire Graham on a good deal. There was not a big return on the Lonzo trade because the pelicans were not going to match, Lonzo wanted out, and Chicago had other things cooking with the other players who may have been potentially included, and they were not going give up a first for the right to sign and trade for Ball like they did DeRozan (they also included that FRP to dump Aminu’s contract). Would I have preferred a better return for Lonzo, yes, but I don’t think we were getting a 1st or White, and would have liked Young over Sato, but that’s only marginally better.  Ultimately the value of return in a sign and trade is not equal to the player, but to the relative willingness for the team with RFA rights to match the number. The Pelicans had less desire to match, thus the lower return. This same logic is also why I think giving up the 1st to Charlotte was a slight overpay for Graham, as they have Ball and Rozier, just drafted Bouknight, so were probably less intent to match to prevent the logjam, but given the low number on Graham they may have matched without the 1st, and of course there is also the added value for the Pels of staying in position to operate over the cap.   We also need to keep in mind that with all the space the Pelicans created, including trade exceptions from disparity of incoming/outgoing contracts, and how they have chosen to operate in the transactions they have made, it is clear that there are several more moves coming, likely also by trade, via MLE/BAE, et al. So any grade on this offseason far is very much incomplete. There are probably at least 2, possibly 3 players who will be in the Pels' rotation this fall that are not currently on the roster.   At this point we should take a look at that new roster, because most of the Pelicans' moves have been made via trade, and involve many players, picks, and coaches I think it is important to consider all of what is coming in, going out, and where they currently are situated.   Outgoing: Coach SVG, Eric Bledsoe/Steven Adams and their bad contracts, Lonzo Ball, Pelicans’ Lottery protected 2022 1st, Top 10 protected Lakers 22’ 1st, Ziare Williams  Incoming: Willie Green, Mike D’Antoni, Jonas Valanciunas, Devonte Graham, Trey Murphy, Tomas Satoransky, Garrett Temple, 2 second round picks, (Re-signed Didi Louzada)  Unused/TBD: Open cap space, Trade exception, Josh Hart Bird Rights, non-tax MLE, BAE  &amp;#x200B;  Even if there were no further moves (there will be) and they just kept/matched Josh Hart, you can argue that they will be a better team with this roster and coaching staff. I would say the roster is slightly less talented as of now with Lonzo out, but it’s not just Graham replacing Lonzo, it will be what the sign and trade for Graham and not overpaying Lonzo gives you, which is the ability to operate as an over the cap team, preserve and utilize exceptions, and extra space with which to operate, along with Hart’s rights and possibly Sato as a small piece/contract to deal. If they are unable to take advantage of this flexibility, or the open space they have, I would fully agree that this offseason has been if not a failure, but a disappointment and a big missed opportunity. But I fully expect them to take advantage of said flexibility.   By operating as an over the cap team, they can bring in a decent sized salary (20-25M) in a trade from a team looking to avoid the tax, save money, or retool their roster. Obvious examples, but of course not limited these guys are Ingles or Bojan from the Jazz, Barnes or Buddy from the Kings. Then of course you can take on salary in conjunction with assets to recoup some of what you sent out, like maybe Washington pays to dump Bertans and you add more shooting to the rotation as well. These are just a few examples that have been thrown out by those that follow the Pelicans closely, but this type player is what I would expect to add.   You also still have space, as well as the MLE and BAE to add guys still on the market that could either start or provide decent depth along the lines of Reggie Jackson, Paul Millsap, Lauri Markkanen, Kelly Oubre, Schroder, Avery Bradley, etc.  They may also choose to keep Josh Hart, or do a sign and trade with him somewhere for another rotation guy or asset.   Then of all the players they acquired, Satoransky could be on the move, as he’s expendable, has some value, is a nice sized number to work into a trade, and keeping him might block the minutes/development of the young guards they like on the roster (who SVG puzzlingly backburnered in favor of an uninterested and underperforming Bledsoe last year). I like Satoransky as depth, but I can see him being moved for something as well.  So, as we can see, there is likely a good bit more to come, so the grade is incomplete. But if they don’t do anything else, or they don’t have a plan of how to utilize their flexibility I would say that they deserve much of the criticism they’ve received, even if this year’s team outperforms last year’s. "
Lauri Markkanen is Trash.
"You're finding out right now just how highly prized Lauri Markkanen is around the league. (Not very.)  First I've heard about picks being offered along with Markkanen at the trade deadline. The reports I've heard said exactly the opposite – that the Pelicans asked for a draft pick in addition, and the Bulls said no."
True he doesn’t solve our problems but he’s more of a band aid than markkanen would be. I can’t believe I’m saying this about lauri cuz a couple years ago I would have loved for the raps to get him
who under-delivered? The team that entered last year with a starting lineup of Coby White-Zach LaVine-Patrick Williams-Lauri Markkanen-Wendell Carter?
The bucks keep losing their players Tucker now Forbs I'd like to see Lauri Markkanen Kelly Oubre Jr join them
Trade Coby and Markkanen (sign and trade) to Pacers for Myles Turner?   Pacers to get a talented young prospect out of it (Coby) and an intriguing if underwhelming player (Lauri) and Bulls get a shot-blocker.   Not sure if Indiana would go for it though.
Markkanen statistically does everything better than Juancho. Believe me. We'll take Lauri
Just reminded by someone else in the comments they still have Lauri Markkanen too
"We still have Lauri Markkanen to move, so we’re not even done yet. I’m guessing we’ll try to package him for another big to replace Thad."
"they are at roughly $127m including lonzo, Caruso, Derozan. This is not including Lauri Markkanen. So they'll be pretty far under the hard cap still."
"While true, the Bulls would be much better with DeRozan and 2-3 vet minimum guys than they will be with Lauri Markkanen and a couple more $5m role players."
"Lauri Markkanen  (Not shilling to raise market value, I swear)"
Bruh he’s a 20/6/6 guy at the cost of Lauri Markkanen. What’s the better alternative to you?
ITS LAURI MARKKANEN ITS NOT THAT GODDAMN HARD
"&gt; They spent Adams, Bledsoe, Ziare Williams, Jared Butler, Lonzo, the Lakers 2022 FRP, and their 2022 FRP (lottery protected), for Graham, Valunciunas, Trey Murphy III, Brandon Boston Jr, Temple, Satoransky, and a second round pick  I'm going to try to recontextualize because I really think you're overstating ""3 first round picks"" here  That also means they sent ~$60.5 million on the books next year for  Lonzo for ~$41.25 million incoming, which leaves them about $97.22 million on roster currently. They've got a qualifying offer in to Josh Hart, and it'll be interesting to see what happens there, but they can spend almost $40 million extra next year before hitting the luxury tax. They don't have the big moves they need this year, but they could fill that space with some young, high upside guys for now like THT, Bruce Brown, maybe even Ntilikina if they want to gamble, or if they wanna pull the trigger on a larger contract and miss Hart they could go after Kendrick Nunn, Dennis Shroeder, Malik Monk, or potentially even Lauri Markkanen.  **TL;DR they pick swapped two picks, gave a Lakers pick, gave a lotto protected first, and lost Lonzo to make $20,000,000 of cap space, ditch 2 of their worst fits, add Graham and Valunciunas, and flesh out the bench a tiny bit. I don't think that's an awful situation, especially given that Lonzo could have just walked sans sign-and-trade**"

"I personally understand letting Lonzo go considering it sounds like he did not want to stay in NOLA but I feel like they could have gotten more right? I was like 99% sure they'd at least get Coby White or Lauri Markkanen out of this but idk, maybe I am way off base here."
So what's the starting lineup next season?   Lonzo/Lavine/Williams/Markkanen/Vučević? Or do you consider dropping Lauri for Coby White and sliding Williams to the PF?
"Disclaimer: I haven't watched much Markkanen.  I have heard multiple pundits - who are often wrong, but not always - mention that there are long stretches of game time where Lauri doesn't impose his will or make a mark on the game. That scares me.   His skill set on paper goes great with SA's young guys, but if he doesn't play hard all the time, he's not going to even get playing time under Pop lol."
Lauri Markkanen almost averaged 20/10 in his 2nd year and look at him now.
If we overpay Lauri Markkanen I'm gonna cry.
Charlotte needs more shooting and Lauri Markkanen would fit that specific need his defense isn't great but he's still young and has room to get better as a player.
Lauri Markkanen
Why would the pacers give up Brogdon for freaking Lauri markkanen
"&gt;If the Bulls want to pay LaVine his max immediately, they would have to renegotiate and extend his contract. This would involve giving him a raise to his max next season and agreeing to an extension based on that figure. LaVine would need a $14.2 million raise to get to his $33.7 million max next season. The Bulls can create that cap space, but doing so would be costly. The Bulls would have to renounce their rights to their other free agents, including former No. 7 overall pick Lauri Markkanen. This sort of extension could pay LaVine up to $195 million.  So Lavine is essentially signing a 5 year 195 million contract this summer after he gets the raise for the current year and tacks on an additional 4 years after that if the Bulls go this route."

"We wouldn’t trade Beasley for Markkanen.  Lauri has way less value basketball wise and is clearly best as a bench shooter.    It would be hard for us to talk value, as you don’t know our bench players any more than I know your bench players real value, but we have some solid pieces and 3 seconds next year.  We could figure something out."
it *would* be pretty fuckin' funny for the Timberwolves to *choose* to have Lauri Markkanen on their team lmao
I think the Spurs are the best fit for markkanen but also wouldn’t mind him as a small ball 5 on the Raptors if they end up trading Siakam. A Barnes + Lauri front court would definitely be fun
"LaVine, DeRozan and... Who? Vuc is a solid defender so you couldn't have meant him, Lonzo and Williams both decent as well. Not to mention that last year's team was above average defensively despite starting LaVine, Coby White and Lauri Markkanen.  You're also ignoring that the bench of full of quality defensive players who will spend time mixed in with the starters - Caruso, Brown Jr, Johnson, Green, Jones Jr, Bradley - all good defenders."
Lauri Markkanen bulked up and lost his basketball powers all in one off season
"That's the secret reason we've been stockpiling taller players. Tacko Fall, Lauri Markkanen, Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen are about to feast."
But Lauri Markkanen.
Lauri Markkanen hasn't lost a playoffs series in his career
I’ve never seen a game with Lauri Markkanen
Lauri Markkanen. I’ve even been guilty of it myself before the blunt pain of reality eventually set in
"I really wanted my Bulls to pick him up with the #7 pick as it was a pretty good situation for them even if he flamed out.  At the time, they had just come off the first year of the rebuild around LaVine (who was recovering from ACL surgery), rookie Lauri Markkanen, and Kris Dunn.  Drafting MPJ and redshirting the entire year (instead of Wendell Cart Jr) would have put more of the focus on Lauri in his second year while seeing what LaVine had left in the tank (hint: a lot) after knee surgery and being deliberately bad while developing the core pieces of your major trade for another season together and maybe netting a top 5 draft pick in the process.   But let's say they end up with #7 again anyway and draft Coby White again. Now you're heading in to that season with 2 lottery pick rookies, in Coby White and MPJ, hopefully some definitive answers on Dunn, LaVine, and Markkanen.   This also would have taken the pressure off Hoiberg to succeed, knowingly redshirting a lottery pick for a year, and perhaps spared us of 20 months of Jim Boylen."
What? They got Lauri Markkanen bro. He’ll for sure take them from the 28th offense to 25th!
I crunched the numbers but then gave a boost to JI (injuries - but eye test says DPOY) and Markkanen (Boylen - but I think he could flourish in the right situation).   1. Bam Adebayo. 2. Jayson Tatum. 3. Donovan Mitchell. 4. OG Anunoby. 5. Jonathan Isaac. 6. Lonzo Ball. 7. John Collins. 8. De'Aaron Fox. 9. Lauri Markkanen. 10. Derrick White.
"I’ll be completely honest the markkanen trade is confusing to me. Trading away nance (sure he doesn’t fit the timeline, but he has solid value) for the privilege of overpaying lauri when you already have mobley/allen in the frontcourt. Sure, it’s possible to split the 96 center/power forward minutes between those 3, but it completely limits lineup flexibility. Come playoff time when you want to play your best guys ~40 minutes each things become quite difficult."
&gt; I gotta admit I wouldn't want to be a Cavs fan right now.  Sorry but this is a bit rich coming from a Pacers fan. The Cavs future is still pretty bright with the amount of young guys on the team. They should be entertaining this year even if the wins aren't there yet. I still think 30 wins is possible though depending on injuries. I don't want to be stuck in the 7-10 seed every year.  &gt; -Undersized backcourt with an undersized shooting guard looking for more money than Terry Rozier.   I'm assuming you are talking about Sexton here. There is no indication he is asking for the moon in contract negotiations. All speculation right now. And Sexton is better than Rozier anyway.  &gt; -Logjam in the frontcourt with players who can't shoot (and don't tell me that Jarrett Allen can space the floor yet he's averaged 0.1 3PA/game for his career).  Logjam of who? Allen isn't meant to space the floor with his shot. He's a great PnR guy with good hands that plays defense. Mobley and Markkanen can absolutely space the floor. And if Love plays he can too.   &gt; -I honestly have no idea how Lauri fits into this. He's basically a black hole on defense.   Clearly the Cavs are taking a chance here but Markkanen will finally get to play with a true PG and just needs to hit threes which he did well last year.  &gt; -Kevin Love's contract for 2 more seasons; dude has shown no inclination to take a buyout.  Doesn't really matter. The Cavs don't ever get huge names in free agency and don't need the cap space. He can sit on the bench for 2 years or play a few minutes. It doesn't really matter either way.
"I’m going to defend Boylen on one thing , Lauri was at his best when he rebounded and ran down the court .Boylen to his credit saw that and encouraged a more board oriented style from Lauri.  Pushing Markkanen to be a better version of himself is what a coach is supposed to do .  He just did it like an asshole.  I assume JB will push Lauri to do many of the same things Boylen did , but be much smarter about it."
the east runs through Lauri Markkanen
Lauri Markkanen if he could play average defense
"Honestly I do think the Wolves need to sit down and think hard about whether it is better for them to move Beasley + DLo or to just move Edwards.   I remember back during the Jimmy Butler trade, it was considered a boondoggle that the Wolves got to keep Wiggins and only had to trade Lavine, Dunn, and the pick that turned out to be Lauri Markkanen. I admittedly personally thought that was a boondoggle at the time. In *retrospect* that was the wrong call - they probably could have gotten the deal done for Wiggins + Dunn and they would have ended up with a better player in Lavine and avoided the painful max of Wiggins.   With young guys, especially young guys who can score, it is far from certain that they pan out into superstars. It’s definitely not easy or obvious to trade Edwards for Simmons, but it’s also not for sure a moronic move. So long as Simmons will be open to Minnesota and staying in Minnesota I think you have to think about rolling out DLo/Simmons/KAT/Beasley/Beverley, which is actually an extremely solid starting 5, even in the West. If Simmons plays even just like 2019 Simmons, that team would be capable of making a finals run with a few lucky bounces. It obviously could also spiral and explode, with Simmons regressing further, KAT shrinking as the games get more consequential, or DLo playing more hero ball as the moments get bigger. But it’s not a crazy move, honestly."
"Garland/Okoro/Simmons/Mobley/Allen  Simmons at SF, Markkanen and Rubio off the bench.  Edit: Could also play Lauri at PF and have Allen on the bench depending on which position Mobley fits better. That lineup would theoretically have decent spacing."
Lauri Markkanen is one of them
"To put into context for others who think Bam is old, he was in the 2017 draft class which included; Markelle Fultz, Lonzo, Jayson Tatum, De'aaron, Jarret Allen, Kuzma, Josh Hart, Lauri Markkanen, and Frank Nilikina."
"You would undoubtedly have seen that already imo if LaVine was in Utah in Mitchell’s place. Playing next to some legitimate NBA point guards (Rubio, Conley) and shooters over the years on a team with a perennial DPOY candidate center, I’m extremely confident that an alpha scorer as efficient as Zach would consistently have that team in the playoffs. I’m hesitant to say he would “lead” them to the playoffs because I’m hesitant to say Mitchell “leads” Utah to the playoffs. He’s undoubtedly their lead man offensively but Rudy Gobert is the guy who drastically raises the floor of the team and makes them as a playoff lock.   I’d like to see Donovan Mitchell lead Lauri Markkanen, Wendell Carter Jr, and Denzel Valentine to the playoffs."
lauri markkanen was the next big thing and going to save bulls’ future… lol
"Too much love: Anthony Davis, Jimmy Butler, Bradley Beal, Zion, Paul George, Tobias Harris  Too much hate: KAT, James Wiseman, Myles Turner, Porzingis, Lauri Markkanen, Kyle Kuzma, pretty much any role player that Lakers/Lebron fans want to throw under the bus whenever the team isn’t playing well."
"As unlikely as it may seem right now, the Sixers path to success is for Zach Lavine to inform the Bulls he won't re-sign despite the moves they made, and for him and Rich Paul to see his best chance at a ring with fellow Klutch client Ben Simmons in Philadelphia.  Winning a chip or coming close with the Sixers dramatically increases the value of three Klutch Sports properties (Simmons, Lavine, Maxey).   Meanwhile, I'm not sure Demar Derozan and Lonzo Ball fit all that well around Lavine.  Is Derozan gonna bury 3pt shots after Lavine drives and kicks it?  I dont think so.  Is Lavine going to cede the #1 scoring role to Derozan and wait for kickouts?  I don't think so.  With all of them together, I still don't think they're better than Atlanta or Boston.   Besides that, the Bulls lost Thaddeus Young and Otto Portert and Lauri Markkanen, but just took Portland's FRP instead of Larry Nance Jr.  I suspect they signed Derozan to a marquee contract and Lonzo Ball to carry the weight after Lavine leaves instead of seriously thinking those guys can make the conference finals in the East.    Because he was in a contract year and had say in where he was going, the Bucks got Jrue Holiday for has-been Eric Bledsoe and picks.  Also in his contract year, the Sixers got Jimmy Butler for Dario Saric and Robert Covington.  It's a players league.  Zach Lavine and Rich Paul have the power.   **Ben Simmons, Zach Lavine, Matisse Thybulle, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid**  **Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Andre Drummond**"

"&gt; He never changed or even attempted to change.  Can I get a quick source on this? Seen it said by a bunch of people, but weirdly none of them seem to have anything to point at other than 'He didn't get any better from an all-star level'.  Simmons is the *only* player expected to develop a shot out of nothing like it's a divine mandate. Pelicans fans don't get mad about Zion not throwing 3's, Heat fans don't burn Herro jerseys because he's not taken another step, even Bulls fans haven't been this bad with Lauri Markkanen. Maybe you don't see it, but all the voices acting like they're owed a great player because they supported them before come across as unbelievably entitled."
"Lauri Markkanen for sure.  It's obvious he has confidence issues, which might diminish with  age. He's still elite in pick and pop plays, and with a good to great defensive center in his team, his lacking  interior defense will be covered. He just need to find a good situation for himself."
"&gt; They had max slot and there were some young, reclamation projects out there  Like who lol? Lauri Markkanen was basically the only one besides Zach Collins who we signed. And given that the cavs gave up a first to get Markkanen, we would've lost out on a first if we got him plus Thad Young who we are also trying to flip for another asset.  John Collins is basically the only other guy that was available and to get him we wouldn't have been able to sign and trade DeMar and we would have had to give him a max."
"Scottie Pippen and Lauri Markkanen.  Hard to find someone meeting either for the first time and then having something positive to say.  Also, the way Scottie Pippen handled his contract was embarrassing.  Even Krauss told him not to sign, but he insisted and then bitched about it for half a decade and didn't play most of a season because he was being a dick."
"48 mins at 4, 48 mins at 5. That’s 96 total minutes between Allen, Markkanen, and Mobley. I think it’s fine. The real issue I have with this trade is that now we are stuck with long contracts and if lauri bombs, it will seriously hurt"
They have a 3 who will be good. They just need to stop doing dumb shit like signing Lauri Markkanen to a bad contract while giving up arguably your best player. They need to stop spending 100 million on an average Center. They need to stop getting in their own way.
"Upvote. For anyone who regularly consumes a lot of NBA media (podcasts, for instance), this is so noticeable. I've been on vacation but has Windhorst even discussed this yet? This kind of topic is SO in his and the Hoop Collective's wheelhouse, yet there wasn't a peep about it in the latest episode.  Another recent situation like this was Portland hiring Billups; the relative silence on Windhorst's and Lowe's podcasts about the allegations was deafening. I remember a Lowe Post coming out like right at the white-hot fever pitch of that controversy and the episode was about some totally unrelated softball topic and didn't so much as mention that something else might be going on. Compare that to The Athletic, where writers / podcast hosts were totally comfortable roasting everyone involved.  It's so jarring to see in my alerts:  - [GOAT newsbreaker Woj] Some crap about the salary structure of the Markkanen deal  - [Relatively unknown Mr. Fischer] HUGE STORY ABOUT THE BIGGEST POWER BROKER IN THE NBA  - [GOAT newsbreaker Woj] Some crap about the picks CHI is getting for Lauri"
"I mean for the Kyrie stuff, he was already half out in 2016 so I don‘t really buy that being Kobys fault, Kyrie always was his own person and I think he would‘ve asked out either way. With the Love deal I wasn‘t happy when it happened, I liked having him for a bit longer but not for anything near for what he actually got.   This thing just doesn’t make a lot of sense to me. Yeah I know we need shooting but I canot find a lot of people who are high on Lauri. Giving up Larry at all and only getting Lauri in return just sucks. And I feel like 17 million are way too much for Markkanen. So all in all I don‘t get it really…"
"They already have a bad defense power forward who can't play center in Love for 2 more seasons and add Markkanen to the mix?  Lauri, Love, Mobley, and Allen is too much"
"Exactly, people who didn’t watch Lauri love to make all these excuses for him but they’re only partially fair. Legit talent shines through for the most part in the NBA when given the minutes to do so.   It’s completely fair to say that Garpax and particularly Jim Boylen made for a shitty environment and that Boylen was a horrible coach, but our at least competent current HC and FO weren’t impressed with Lauri either.   I say this as someone who has a Markkanen jersey and was thrilled with the pick at the time. I don’t dislike the guy. I understand why he seems shiny at a glance. He had a legitimately impressive rookie season but has regressed since without ever showing any improvement as a defender or physical rebounder despite his athletic physique. He’s a good shooter but streaky and won’t consistently impact the game in any other way when he’s off.   In addition to all of that, he has trouble staying healthy. I just don’t understand the urgency from Cleveland to give him a contract like that. Glad to have the picks though."
Lauri trade Markkanen of an era
"I mean, it's still not discussed over the media because it is still fresh but yeah, pretty much.  Now they got Love, Mobley, Allen and Markkanen as big men and all of them would want to be a starter(maybe except for Love, he wants to be traded). But from the experience from 2021 Bulls, Lauri won't even fight for it and actually get demoralized instantly and won't contribute well on the bench either. I really wonder Cavs paid him that much if his starter position isn't guaranteed."
"Did you watch the Bulls and Markkanen this season?  If Markkanen was in his 2018 mode, that would be worth it. But 2021 Markkanen was a guy who got outperformed by, leave starter PF(Patrick Williams, a rookie) alone, but by his bench teammates as well. No one went for a salary over 10-12M/year for Lauri on trade proposals because of that and the Bulls was going to give him no higher than 9M because of it."
"Just that Lauri could have been signed outright since the Bulls couldn't have resigned him. So if they badly wanted him, just free up some space... Also Nance had much more value IMO. They could have gotten a 1st outta him, freed up money, gotten Lauri. Likr this they traded away one hone guy that wanted to stay there, extremely rare situation, and even a 2nd for a guy like Markkanen that could have been taken differently. smh, i do not get it at all."
"DJJ is bad.   I love Airplane Mode, but he's super one-dimensional. He'll probably be better than Lauri just by virtue of the fact that he'll buy into his role, but he's definitely worse than Markkanen."
i mean nance is good (and better than lauri) but markkanen is definitely the centerpiece here. dude is getting 67 million over 4 years that’s a big commitment
Lauri got 17 a year. Luckily I think cleaveland can play him at the 3 which could be interesting.  Garland/Sexton/Markkanen/Mobley/Allen is a very tall front court to go around a smaller backcourt
Wendell Carter Jr &amp; Lauri Markkanen
"If people honestly think that the Bulls aren’t making the playoffs, then god damn I want what they’re smoking. Look, you have two offensive MACHINES in Lavine and Derozan, a great distributor (side note Derozan has also become an awesome distributor) and defender in Lonzo Ball, and the dude who fucking dragged the god dAMNED MAGIC to the playoffs the last 3 years. Also y’all can trade Lauri Markkanen for some legitimately good pieces. If two of four of the above pieces stay healthy, they’re making the playoffs it’s not even a fucking question. Even if two of four are injured I’m still taking the Bulls as at least the 8-seed. And anyone who has the Wiz minus Westbrook over the Bulls is a fucking idiot!"
I’ve seen some old posts from a few years ago where a lot of guys said that Lauri Markkanen will be better than Tatum
"We still have Lonzo caruso, pat williams and whatever lauri markkanen Will turn into"
"As per the NBA rules on the MLE:   ""Mid-Level Salary Exception for Room Teams: If a team has Salary Cap room at any time during a Salary Cap Year such that the team lost its Exceptions and has not already used the Bi-annual Exception, the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary or the Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exceptions in the same Salary Cap Year, then the team may use the MLSE for Room Teams to sign one or more players to contracts with first-year salaries that, in the aggregate, provide for a total up to $4.449 million. Contracts signed using this exception can cover up to two seasons and can be used to re-sign a team’s own free agent, but not to acquire a player by assignment.""  The qualifying offer is of course likely to be larger. Bulls can still give Markkanen the most money, but of course it is unlikely that they end up trying to re-sign him solely because the market has dried up for him. What I feel like the Bulls were wanting was for someone to give Lauri and offer sheet and then decide on whether or not it was worth matching. But of course since no one has done that yet, it is difficult for them to gage whether or not he is going to be too expensive to bring back. And sure enough, just like Schroder, Lauri screwed himself by overvaluing himself. I am sure he was hoping for something like 4 years, $90 million as a starting point. Sadly though, he is likely only worth like 4 years, $60 million as it stands right now. Dude is a shoe-in to miss over 20 games a season. He just came off his worst season in the league, albeit his best overall shooting year. He got worse in just about every stat and the Bulls have an insanely solid starting unit with Vucevic, Ball, DeRozan and of course LaVine. There wouldn't be nearly enough touches for Lauri. He'd likely only get around 12 shots a night and his entire game is predicated on him shooting and scoring the ball without contributing much of anything else.  His best role would be that of a backup PF that can be given the green light at all times to score.  Another good role would be if he plays alongside a defensive stalwart such as Gobert or Capela, who don't need to shoot the ball or demand attention on offense nearly as much."
"Darius Garland - 6'3""  Collin Sexton - 6'1""  Lauri Markkanen - 7'  Evan Mobley - 7'  Jarrett Allen - 6'11""  **Average height: 6'6ish**"
Even Lauri Markkanen hasn’t been bad on defense. Jumping passing lanes and getting good contests.
Ah yes. Known wing stopper Lauri Markkanen. Doing what we all predicted.
"With Lauri Markkanen as their primary defense in the past 3 games, Paul George was 6 of 20 for 12 points, MPJ was 4 of 14 with 11 points and Deandre Hunter was 2-11 with 8 points."
"Who knew you could build an elite team defense with Lauri Markkanen playing the three? All of Finland, that's who.   Helps to have the absolute defensive monster of Evan Mobley on the floor too, haha."
"With Lauri Markkanen as their primary defense in the past 3 games, Paul George was 6 of 20 for 12 points, MPJ was 4 of 14 with 11 points and Deandre Hunter was 2-11 with 8 points."
"Lauri Markkanen: The Paul George stopper  Reggie Jackson blatantly changing his pivot foot 25 feet from the hoop in front of the entirety of Staples Center and not getting called for a travel perfectly summed up this game, F- refereeing tonight"
"Not Lauri Markkanen, that’s for sure."
The only reason people care about the Cavs is because it's LeBron's hometown team.  They have everything your average lottery team has but in a less exciting way.  They have a couple dynamic guards that could drop 30 any given night... but they're Collin Sexton and Darius Garland.  They have a fancy rotation they go to for the nerds to get excited... but it's just Lauri Markkanen starting at SF.  They have a meme player that people like who's actually a solid NBA pro... but it's just Cedi Osman.  They snatched a franchise changing player via the greatest draft class in recent memory... but it's a bigman.

It'll be seen on highlight reels for centuries to come, and I wouldn't be surprised if it helped sway the Bulls GM's decision on whether or not Lauri gets signed to a supermax deal."

Lauri Markkanen for NVP
"**Lauri Markkanen.**  We get an interesting forward who can shoot, but has his deficiencies (rebounding/defense).   We give him a new coach each year including the flame out of Jim Boylen and run such starting PGs in his time here as Kris Dunn or fucking *Walt Lemon Jr*.   We really never did anything to help him succeed. We first made him bulk up and try to play center, which hurt his mobility and fixed nothing. Hes a player if drafted to like the Spurs would be so much further developed"
"Yes to Allen, he’s a young talent C that’s not even that high. Steven Adams years ago signed 4/100.   Markkanen we’ve had one game so it’s early to tell but I don’t love it I don’t hate it. Especially when you got guys like Kennard and Bertans, shooters get paid.   Rubio has been awesome so I don’t get that one but love was a loyalty contract but yes I do hate it.   Windler is like a 10th rotation guy and you could just about do this for any team picking apart misses but I don’t judge teams for not striking gold so late in the draft   Sexton is better than Bridges even if he is a better champion piece. MPJ I’m not sold on and SGA didn’t workout for us, I wouldn’t pick someone like that either.   Now to the end of your hit piece, Lauri is a complimentary piece to Mobley and Allen is our 5 till Mobley gets stronger. Mobley is in his 1st year we aren’t trying to compete right away he needs to grow into his body"

Purely for skill development purposes. If you've seen him play for our national team, you might have an idea of his abilities.  Of course you don't want him to actually defend NBA centers, but at least he's a legit 7 footer."

"&gt;Lol. I absolutely know that.   Im sure you ""absolutely"" knew Miami was making the finals in the bubble, and that Hawks would make the ECF last year, and that Bucks was winning it all vs Suns in the finals. Every single year we see teams surprisingly overperform/underperform and its impossible to know how a season is going to play out.   &gt;What, is Zach Lavine good enough to lead a championship team that features a defense that couldn't defend my grandmother?  Yawn. How many times can this be repeated? We were ranked 12th defensively last year and if anything we upgraded our roster defensively, our worst defender this year in Derozan will be replacing Lauri Markkanen who was also one of the worst defenders in the league. Everything so far indicates that we will be atleast average defensively."
* Bulls being better off with Zach Lavine being the first option instead of Lauri Markkanen. * Terry Rozier being good in Charlotte  * Hawks beating the Sixers  * Heat being good immediately after the Jimmy Butler trade.
"The math behind that article is pretty solid. Important to note that this is best used when assessing changes in 3 point percentage. So for example, Lauri Markkanen shot 40% from 3 last year on 300 attempts. The previous 3 years, he had shot a bit less than 36% on 1000 attempts. Blackport's analysis says that because the most recent year's sample size is too small, you can't tell whether the difference in shooting is due to randomness or improved skill level."

"It really all depends on if any of their young players are any good. Personally I don't think that any of the guys they have outside of Mobley is a franchise player, and Mobley I haven't seen enough of to make a fair judgement yet.  They have a few decent young players, but is anybody realistically frightened of a team who's best player is Jared Allen? Or Lauri Markkanen? Or Darius Garland?  But at least they haven't traded all of their future flexibility away in order to assemble this mediocre roster. All it takes is some luck and for one of these young guys to pop and they have the assets to flip some picks and reassemble the team.  They're probably still a few years away from making any noise, but they aren't totally hopeless, and at least Cavs fans have a title to enjoy this millenium.

"The Lakers are definitely the most popular team outside the US, with only the Warriors being close. That being said, you’ll see wayyyyy more Bulls jerseys and apparel in Europe than any other team. I’m in the UK and I’ve genuinely seen more Lauri Markkanen Bulls shirts and jerseys than LeBron shirts and jerseys.   That being said, I think most of these people are fans of the Bulls as a fashion brand, not as a basketball team lol. The Jordan effect is very real."

"I saw someone calling Evan Mobley ""Evan Garnett"" the other day and that really tickled me.  When Matthew Dellavedova was here, Outback Jesus was a pretty good name.  Of course there's Sexland for Collin Sexton and Darius Garland.  There's been the name floating around for our trio of 7-footers (Jarrett Allen, Evan Mobley, Lauri Markkanen) of ""Tower City"" because there's an area in Cleveland called the Tower City Center. Though personally, as a Kent State alum, I'm hoping to get the name ""Tri-Towers"" going because those were the dorms I lived in."

Lauri Markkanen
"Anybody have the clip of Lebron's and1 play? Second quarter 8:10, it looked like he football tackled Lauri Markkanen and they called the guy for a defensive foul."
"""Honey, what are you doing?""  ""I'm insulting some guy on the internet because he thinks Lauri Markkanen is an average starter. He's so stupid"""
We have a nice forward named Lauri Markkanen who might just be what you are looking for lol
"Can't say I'd agree with Markkanen being a top 100 player or a solid starter. To me Lauri is just another Davis Bertans in that he's a bad defender whose only worthwhile skill is his 3 ball right now, so on any given night where that 3 ball isn't falling for him he's a legitimate net negative to his team."
"Free agency moves fast. Let's say a big is on your wishlist as a team, and you make a play for John Collins when Free Agency starts. Hawks have 3 days to match that, and that's 3 days you can't make a play for Lauri Markkanen, Jarrett Allen, Richaun Holmes, Serge Ibaka, PJ Tucker, Paul Milsap or Blake Griffin. That's not even considering the other free agents at other positions. You're probably the man out and have to settle with your 3rd, 4th option or worse if the Hawks match.   Hawks are in a position where they can afford to match max for John Collins and still extend Trae Young for max. Going after Collins is risky. Even if you're the Spurs or Thunder and you've got the cap to extend a max offer sheet, who's to say Collins would want to leave Atlanta where they just finished a rebuild, and go to a rebuilding team again for maybe $2m more a year?"
&gt; Stop trying to force our hand for your benefit  ??? this is sports and i'm not a team owner. my benefit lmfao.  ok go use that cap space to signnnn Evan Fournier! he's 28. perfect for the raptors.   just look at this fantastic list of players who are totally worth 20mil+ a year and fit the raptors timeline:  https://www.spotrac.com/nba/free-agents/   oooo Lauri Markkanen!!!!
"Lakers should try to get Rose, Tucker and Milsap to come over for vet min deals to win a ring and offer Reggie Bullock or Doug McDermott the MLE. Then try to S&amp;T Schroeder for Lauri Markkanen or Jarrett Allen."
&gt; And if you have $50 mil in cap space you should be looking to get more than Lauri Markkanen caliber players.   Like who? I'd be pretty shocked if the hawks let Collins walk after they made the ECF with him. There's very few good young free agents this year.
"&gt;I see no reason to worry about paying 10M/year for 2 years to a backup 5.  If they are going to do something like max John Collins then that cap space will start dwindling real fast. Whether its JC or some other player, point is in the FA market you pay good not great players $20-30 mil $50 mil wont look like much very long. And if you have $50 mil in cap space you should be looking to get more than Lauri Markkanen caliber players.   $10 mil vs minimum level contracts always matters when you are trying to build up your talent base. It's not worth freaking out about but it's also just not good business."
S&amp;T with Lauri Markkanen maybe? They need shooters. Maybe they can do better but that would certainly be great for the Bulls.
The spurs have 50M in cap space and the best guy we can realistically spend that money on is Lauri Markkanen. I see no reason to worry about paying 10M/year for 2 years to a backup 5.
"Markkanen shoots 40% on 6 attempts from deep. Bagley 34% on 2.5 attempts. If you go by career then Bagley shoots 31% on 2 attempts and Lauri 37% on 6 attempts. So Lauri is definitely a better shooter by a significant margin.  He has been very frustrating to watch last two seasons though, just no counter moves at all so if he doesn't have a clear lane or gets stopped when he attacks he just kicks it out and camp at the perimeter. Bad touch on contested layups and floaters, no post game either so he cant abuse mismatches. He has no killer instinct either so cant be counted on when his team needs him.  He could be very valuable in the right situation cause he is definitely talented, he will just need a lot of help to put it all together."
"I want to disagree, because I think of Lauri as a stretch big that can shoot better than Bagley, but statistically he’s basically the same as bags, maybe 1-2% better on 3pt.. and neither of them can defend. I kind of imagine Lauri as a Great Value brand Porzingis  I haven’t seen a ton of bulls games the past few seasons though, so ya know I barely know anything about Markkanen. But I’m just biased cause he’s Finnish and my people need some representation"
"Alright. Let’s list a 12-man roster for each team.  Team USA starters: Curry, Kawhi, Bron, KD, AD Team USA Bench: Harden, Thompson, George, Butler, Holiday, Draymond, Lopez/Turner/Allen if we really need a big body.  Team Europe Starters: Doncic, Bogdanovic, Bogdanovic, Antetokounmpo, Gobert Team Europe Bench: Jokic, Gallinari, Porzingis, Sabonis, Vucevic, Capela, Valanciunas  Now, for team USA:  - Team USA has All NBA talent written amongst all of them. Their offense is unstoppable — everyone can iso, everyone can move off the ball, open looks everywhere, and have great ball movers.   - Also, everyone can shoot. Everyone also has IQ, on both ends. Their defense can be weak at times (when no AD can anchor the defense, but Dray at the 5 or Lopez/Turner/Allen can work okay just not great) but their guard/wing defense is also unstoppable. Kawhi/Bron IQ off the charts, and these are just from the starters.   - Everyone is good/borderline elite at on ball or off ball defense. Not a single one of these guys can be hunted on the mismatch (aside from the obvious point guard being hunted for the big man, but we have Holiday who could play for Curry if he gets hunted a lot). They can’t hunt anyone on iso’s. They can switch everyone on defense. Literally there’s nothing that this team can’t do.   On the other hand, we have Team Europe.   - Your starters have elite offense, Luka-Giannis PNR would be unstoppable (but it would kind of not work because Gobert clogs up the paint).   - Giannis is also a non-shooter, and team USA can deploy the Giannis wall to stop him. And even if he makes the right read and makes the right pass, team USA’s defensive IQ + defensive personnel is enough to either close out or rotate on the open man.  - Gobert can’t run the PNR with Luka (he can only run it with Conley) but even if he can run it he can only finish lobs, so if they deny him the lob his other option would only be to pass, since he doesn’t have a post game.   - That bench lineup is also sus, they lack a ballhandling guard (could use maybe Dragic here, but if you have at least 2 of Luka/Jokic/Giannis on the floor then playmaking wouldn’t be a real issue) OR a defensive wing (OG Anunoby could be good here).  - You also have bucket getters in both the Bogies but they’re only average on defense (including Luka as well).   - Gobert’s defense can be schemed against (see Clippers vs Jazz series) and if they replace him with someone like Jokic or Vucevic their defense will very much take a hit, the USA squad will feast on it.   - Capela is also a paint clogger, and everyone else is at most average on defense (and this is me being generous lol).   - Also, you got Porzingis, who’s a spot up shooter who can’t really bang anyone on the low post despite being a 7 ft giant lol.   (Btw, this is the best European players of 2020-2021. If you wanna replace anyone here, you could replace them with the likes of Evan Fournier, Dennis Schroder, OG Anunoby, Goran Dragic, Maxi Kleber, Jusuf Nurkic, Enes Kanter, Lauri Markkanen.)   So, after doing a bit of research, I must say that the USA team has no glaring holes in them (assuming that AD plays at the 5, otherwise their biggest hole would be center, and even then I’d say that Lopez/Turner or even Allen are serviceable enough that they can, at the very least, apply pressure and slow down anyone under the rim but not outright stop them completely). Team Europe tho, their bench is really average defensively but everyone is pretty good offensively. No one is really elite here (except for Jokic, Luka, and Giannis; although 2 of these are average at defense so they’re only elite offensively). Not to mention that there are more potential superstars in the upcoming future, this isn’t to mention Zion, Morant, Mitchell, Young, Booker, Edwards, Mobley, Cunningham, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Chet Holmgren. Heck, we could even throw someone like Mikal Bridges or Trey Murphy III, who could be very very good defensively (and offensively we only need them to knock their 3s down). Europe has maybe at most a few, and even then they’re not guaranteed to be superstars (only Luka was the most recent one).  So, as of now, and in the future, Team USA &gt; Team Europe."
"Lauri Markkanen, calling it here. If he gets a competent PG and dedicated touches... Look out."
If you honestly think Shai and Lauri f'n Markkanen (even at his BEST season) are the same level of talent then I can't be bothered with this man.
"Big ass shotgun, look like Lauri Markkanen"
"&gt;bulls couldn't keep him when he did that to nikola mirotic.  This is a false narrative. Our org held Niko just as responsible for that fight as Bobby, and all the players at the time pretty heavily took Bobby's side. We even ended up trading Niko that year and offered Bobby an extension. We offered him 4 years 40 million even though we had just drafted Lauri Markkanen, but he turned it down so we traded him as part of the package for Otto Porter Jr because we were going to lose him for nothing to free agency."
