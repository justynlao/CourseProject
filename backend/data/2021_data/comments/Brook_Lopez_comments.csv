"That seems like a crazy good defensive lineup.   Jrue Holiday, top-tier guard defender  Donte DiVincenzo, apparently a decent perimeter defender  Kris Middleton, great wing defender  Giannis Antetokounmpo, reigning DPOY  Brook Lopez, elite paint protector  How does anyone ever score on them? Hopefully I'll see tonight, lol."
"Any defense that plays Bryn Forbes and DJ Augustin major bench minutes will suffer. Anyways last season the Bucks defense was just as good without Brook Lopez on the floor, why? Because of Giannis. Giannis at 5, giannis at 4, it didn't matter. All his numbers and stats were elite."
"Deron Williams, Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, Joe Johnson, Brook Lopez is an Olympic team"
"As my hero, Johnny Lawrence, said, “the best defense is more offense”. We should just double down on the offense. Let’s get Enes Kanter, Brook Lopez, Lou Williams, Kevin Love, Tim Hardaway Jr., Doug McDermott... can we bring back Marshon Brooks? He was always good for a bucket.   Realistically though, I'm beginning to think it'll be tough for us to fix the defense when you have Harden/Kyrie playing 30+ minutes a game. They can't guard anyone and they're getting destroyed on switches. We could have Ben Wallace or KG anchoring the D and it'll be brutal. At best, we should try to find ways to limit offensive rebounding/TOs and ways that can reduce opponent shot attempts, because they'll hit anywhere north of 45%.  Basically, if we get to shoot 5-10% more than the opponent does, then we'll probably win more than lose. Play to our strengths, Harden, Durant are good rebounders and any future PF/C we get should just be great at rebounding more than defense. Board and make good decisions should be our mantra."
"I don't know about that. CP3 makes 16 million more than Jrue this year so the Bucks would've had to put more players in the trade to match the contract or get a 3rd team involved. And a quick google search of potential trades for CP3 either included Middleton, Brook Lopez or players who didn't resign with us to match the money needed to get CP3."
"I feel like every year we see a big start taking 3s and having an incredible 3PT%, then after that first year it is in the 34-38% range.  * Pau Gasol was a 29% 3PT shooter on 0.2 attempts, then goes to San Antonio and leads the league shooting 54% on 1.6 attempts per game. Afterwards he is 37% in his next 3 seasons. * Marc Gasol was an 18% 3PT shooter on 0.1 attempts then all of a sudden a 39% 3PT shooter on 4 attempts per game, since then he's regressed to 36% * Brook Lopez was a 9% 3PT shooter on 0.1 attempts then 36% on 5 attempts per game. Since then he's regressed to 34.6%, including 31.8% last year. * Valanciunas went from 25% on less than 0.1 attempts, up to 41% on 1 attempt per game, then has regressed down to 32.7%  All of these guys were not really face up guys aside from maybe Pau, so I think defenders were slow to trust their new 3PT shot and they had a lot of space to shoot 3s the first year they started taking more 3s. Once defenses realized they were a 3PT threat the next season, the % declined a bit, but were still reliable.  EDIT: I guess Dieng has been taking 2+ 3s a game for a few years now and hitting them around 35-38%."
"Really surprised by his 3pt shooting.  Looked like a fish out of water shooting the ball his first few years, just another big man that would never be able to shoot.  But these past 3 years he's gone full Brook Lopez, 34% -&gt; 35% -&gt; 39% this year. Crazy. Makes him so much more valuable."
"would be really nice, he'd be a rich man's Brook Lopez on offense and give them another half-court scoring option.  With Giannis, Middleton &amp; Jrue out there you could cover up defensively and just ask him to do what he can do well, nothing more.  Unfortunately I'm not sure the Bucks have enough bullets left in the clip to get him..."
"Marc Gasol, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez"
"Idk about that, Nets are a bad matchup for the Bucks.    Brook Lopez is a drop big, and as good as giannis is he is scoring two at a time.   Nets have too much shooting and Bud'd defense gives them up"
If brook lopez' Yeti feet can fit over there everyone else is fine.
"I get what your saying, but centers in general need to be part of a scheme to highlight their strengths. Brook Lopez made 2nd team all NBA defence last season because the team built a scheme around his strengths. The Bucks played drop and Lopez allowed him use his massive body and long arms to stone people at the rim. They didn’t ask him to hard hedge or switch or things he can’t do.   Also, I would not say the Nuggets exactly have a tailor made team to play around Jokic. Who are the plus defenders on this team? Murray is pretty average, Barton is ok I guess, MPJ doesn’t really no what he is doing and is out of position a lot. Harris is the only plus permitter defender, and Millsap is not the weak side shot blocker we once was."
60% of the Nets all time starters are on the team right now.  Clunky fit but go for best talent  PG- Kidd  SG- Kyrie  SF- Harden  PF- Durant  C- Brook Lopez
The bucks don’t do this. Brook Lopez is the most likely to bitch about a call or shot on the team.
He will never be better than Brook Lopez though  /s
Their opponents are shooting 38.9% from 3 (up 3.1% from last year) and 49.8% from 2 (up 4.2% from last year). The drop defense and Brook Lopez being unable to switch while also getting scored on a lot more in the paint is killing them. The other team going 50/40 on a nightly basis is a great recipe for a loss.
"One Iverson made enemies in every front office outside of Denver and that's questionable if he didn't in Denver. Two Westbrook hasn't shown an unwillingness to go to the bench as was what many thought of him when he was drafted. Three he's a three star recruit that lucked out because circumstances got him in good positions. He wasn't going to be in UCLA until Farmar left, 2 Kevin Love came to the Bruins his sophomore year, 3 he could've stayed but that would be detrimental to his draft stock since Jrue Holiday was coming and UCLA may not have given him the minutes or attention, and lastly Sam Presti wanted him more than what scouts thought. They had Brook Lopez over Westbrook in many mock drafts. So in many respects he's overachieved his entire career now comes can he adapt once his max contract is up."
The bucks 4th quarter offense was brook lopez in the lowpost lmao
"Brook Lopez didn’t shoot 3’s until his 7th year, now he’s formidable. Jason Kidd was known as Ason Kidd for a large chunk. Stranger things have happened"
"The previous 2 years with the same scheme, opposing teams shot slightly below average from three against the Bucks. This year, Bryn Forbes is getting heavy minutes off the bench and he might be the worst perimeter defender in the NBA. Going from Wesley Matthews to Forbes is a very big downgrade on defense. Also George Hill to DJ Augustin is a big downgrade on defense. And the Bucks have Brook Lopez in the starting lineup and he’s much more effective when he doesn’t switch on screens but that can occasionally lead to some decent looks for the opponent from three. Other than that, other teams have just had lucky nights like when Bledsoe made 7 contested threes last night."
25 million dollar Brook Lopez
"bubble v Heat last year was hugely on Bud and a little on the players.    Bud - did not adjust his schemes that made Jae Crowder look like Klay Thompson.Dragic was feasting off pull up 3s vs Brook Lopez. Heat got good looks throughout series. Also his infamous regular season rotation load managing the stars' minutes in a damned playoff series.   Players - Giannis was playing below his averages vs Bam, Iggy and Butler defense and exposed his lack of go to moves. Except in that game 4 before getting injured. I hate to say this Im primarily a Giannis stan from abroad.    KMid was inefficient throughout the series even during the sole win when he carried team.    Blednoshow as usual. Brook was most consistent on O but as usual flatfooted liability on defense. Rest of the bench did not make impact."
"Giannis is still limited in the halfcourt, Brook Lopez is unable to play in any scheme other than deep drop, their bench is awful."
It’s funny because I’m pretty sure he took that from Brook Lopez. Lopez (Nets at the time) used that move on Embiid so many times in his rookie season. The next game Embiid started doing it and from there he’s really just perfected.
Every slowmo replay they show of Brook Lopez is just regular speed
Would you take Brook Lopez (friendly contract) and Donte Divincenzo (next white guy leaper) and Bucks legend DJ Wilson?
You do the Boogie signing every time - but if I’m not mistaken we could’ve had Brook Lopez for the ~2.5mil he signed with Milwaukee for. Haunts me.
"2014 Nets: Prime KG, Pierce, Brook Lopez, Joe Johnson, Livingston, Plumlee, Jason Terry (6MOH), Deron Williams (2X all NBA)"
I think that going from current barely-an-NBA-player DeAndre Jordan to peak Clippers DeAndre Jordan would be such a massive improvement that it would be the Nets. The current defense and rebounding weakness they have would be largely erased. They'd also get Heat Tyler Johnson and whatever the best version of Jeff Green was.   The 2013-2014 Nets could be another answer for the second question.  Deron Williams/Shaun Livingston   Joe Johnson/Jason Terry   Paul Pierce/Andrei Kirilenko   Kevin Garnett/Mirza Teletovic   Brook Lopez/Mason Plumlee
"Vince Carter has announced a few of our games this year, and he’s great. I feel like he’s played with half the league at this point lol, so he has personal stories about everybody. It was funny hearing him talk about Brook Lopez being his rookie considering that Lopez is a 13 year vet and VC just retired."
"The thing with Conley is he's never been a complete snub, but if he was in the East he probably would've had 2 or 3, maybe even 4 selections by now.        -----          - 2012-13: 15/3/6 on 44/36/83 shooting to go with 2.2 steals and leading Memphis to a 56 win season.          - 2013-14: 17/3/6 on 45/36/82 shooting to go with 1.5 steals and leading Memphis to a 50 win season.           - 2014-15: 16/3/6 on 45/39/86 shooting to go with 1.3 steals and leading Memphis to a 55 win season.       - 2016-17: 21/4/6 on 46/41/86 shooting to go with 1.3 steals and leading Memphis to a 49 win season pace at the ASB.          Would’ve made it in 2012-13 for an injured Rondo over Brook Lopez (A Big) or should’ve been over Jrue and Kyrie in the first place as Memphis would’ve been a 2 seed in the East compared to them both missing playoffs with under 35 wins.      Would’ve made it in 2013-14 as he had better stats, and impacted winning more than Joe Johnson..Memphis would’ve been a 3 seed in the East…Nets were just 24-27 at the All-Star break.     Would’ve made it in 2014-15 as he had better stats than Jeff Teague and at worse better than Kyle Korver..Memphis would’ve been a 2 seed in the East.     Would’ve made it in 2016-17 as he impacted winning more than Kemba Walker..Memphis would’ve been a 3 seed in the East at the All-Star break compared to 11 seed Hornets. Even maybe over Melo for a wildcard spot.      ----       TLDR: Conley, in the East, would've/should've been an All Star in: 2013 over Jrue, 2014 over Joe Johnson, 2015 over Korver or Teague, and 2017 over Kemba or Carmelo)"
"In fairness, the Nets pick was supposed to be better.   They were the worst team in the NBA. Didn't have any real rising stars and had just traded their best player in Brook Lopez. I'm pretty sure in the previous two seasons Brooklyn had been like 0-17 when Lopez sits."
"Brooklyn Nets of 2013/2014. Jason Kidd was head coach. Joe Johnson, Deron Williams, Brook Lopez, Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Andrei Kirilenko, Shaun Livingston, Mason Plumlee. They also had Jason Terry and Reggie Evans but traded them to Sacramento mid-season."
Yeah but they got Brook Lopez playing like goddamn Embiid.
Lopez with 20 on 73/67/100 splits. Khash and Giannis playing well is expected but Brook was terrific tonight
"Zion would likely shoot a much higher percentage with a center like brook lopez spacing the floor for him, also they don’t really run plays through Zion and he doesn’t get many touches so all his looks are heavily contested, he doesn’t get to pick and choose when he passes out of shots"
"&gt;Who would he guard on the contenders as the starter?  Ibaka, Gobert, Theis, Brook Lopez all feel like reasonable matchups for a 36-year-old Bosh. Jokic/Embiid are the only obviously tough matchups, but no one stops those guys, and Bosh should be better than most. Maybe he's have to play limited minutes against the Lakers, but that's about it.  I see Bosh's game aging a lot like Duncan's. Timmy won the title (and started) at 37. I see no reason 36-year-old Bosh couldn't be the 4th-best player on a title team."
"In your defense, both of those guys have been interviewed about Duncan:  https://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/04/thunder-steven-adams-tim-duncan-nice-guy-story   https://www.poundingtherock.com/2019/10/8/20904850/when-tim-duncan-welcomed-brook-lopez-to-the-jungle"
"First of all, I know who you are cuz of that stupid /r/PicsofJohn so these dumbass takes are not surprising coming from you.  So you just completely ignored his point huh? Back when Shaq was in his prime a stretch 5 who shot 3s was almost unheard of. Now their ubiquitous. You don't think having to defend someone like Brook Lopez whose absolutely lethal if you leave him alone out there would negatively impact Shaq's defensive value? Because it absolutely would"
I already said in the post that:  &gt; Bud can be blamed for is their defensive scheme and even in that regard he is somewhat limited by personnel -- Brook Lopez cannot play any other defensive coverage.  Lol at the suggestion that Bud is controlling whether Giannis posts up or runs PnR on a possession by possession basis.
"Kidd also completely broke Giannis's shot.   To answer that guy's question, Brogdon made a huge leap in Bud's first year. Donte's improved every year. Brook Lopez has had a career renaissance, and even though Giannis has some ***massive, horrific flaws*** in his game, Bud turned him into a 2x consecutive MVP.   I can't believe anyone's reminiscing on the _Jason Kidd days_."
Like I said in the post:  &gt; I think Bud can be blamed for is their defensive scheme and even in that regard he is somewhat limited by personnel -- Brook Lopez cannot play any other defensive coverage.
"Refs dont call anything in the playoffs. I know you guys just traded for John, but walls are always going to be their come playoff time.   Coach Bud needs a plan b if the 3s aint falling and that should be Brook Lopez in the low post."
You would get to see Embiid guard Giannis while Brook Lopez guards Embiid
I think Brook Lopez would look good in Brooklyn.
make sense yes but none of this is realistic  i saw some brook lopez trade stuff too so it could be expanded even
"KP looking like the second best defensive centre in the West again. A poor man's Gobert-esque rim protection + Brook Lopez style offense, with much better mobility = top 5 big man in the league"
Derrick Rose for Brook Lopez and a pick if the Bucks even have any picks left
Brook Lopez for Kostas. Im sure Giannis wants all his bro to be there lmao
Both teams go to shit. I’m trying to imagine a Jokic and Brook lopez front court and it’s disgusting in the bad way
"This is a brain dead take lol. If you know literally anything about Xs and Os and NBA rotations, you'd know how abysmal a coach Walton is. He's not even a good personality manager; the dude had Brook Lopez crying on the bench because of how poorly Luke used him when they were both in LA lol  &gt; Then there's also the fact that he had a better record coaching the Warriors than Kerr did.  Also, if you think Luke had any role in the Warriors' success during this period... Lmao"
"Lol of all people to rep, you choose Brook Lopez?? What kind of fantasy land am I living in here."
"It's that big big combo that clogs up the paint. Let's talk about a realistic for that wouldn't be hard to get, say Brook Lopez. The need a big man that stretches on offense but plays like a true center in defense. Porzigos (how ever you spell that) would be like ideal."
"Brook Lopez shouldnt have been in the lineup at all.  That said, people have gone way too far with the Bud = Bad that people are blaming him for losing a close game to the best team in the league lol"
Brook Lopez says hello
"Myles Turner isn't the ideal stretch big, although Brook Lopez does fit the bill or Ibaka, Chris Boucher, PJ Washington.   Reaches would be John Collins and Wiseman, who surprisingly has range."

"Middleton has a 2-time MVP on his team, Giannis ain't LeBron but he's still one of the top-5 players in the league currently. Where was Middleton vs the Raptors in 2019 when Giannis needed him? Dude was outscored in the series by Brook fucking Lopez  I know Kyrie is headcase and probably the closest thing in the NBA to a Karen, but that man can play and its crazy how people are underrating him as a player just because he's a bit of an idiot."
"Yeah, because you let them. You play a slow ass center like Brook lopez, you’re going to pay the price"
"I think the bigger problem was him not guarding AD so Brook Lopez was in the action.   That being said, he was in foul trouble so I understand the move"
brook lopez should not be closing games! One 7 footer is plenty. If they can switch well it's suffocating.
"I know Dray is still in the league, but I think the title for most illegal, illegal screens should be passed on to brook Lopez"
Abolish Brook Lopez being Giannis’ bail out shooter
Just a reminder that Brook Lopez was a Lakers player and loves Disneyland.
Beat down the court by Brook Lopez... Where's the fucking effort.
"3 timeouts already, eh? We're really getting beat in the non Giannis minutes by Brook Lopez and Kris Middleton pulling a ""Laker"" on the Lakers?"
Lopez! Miss you brook 😔
"They need a guy like Marc Gasol or Brook Lopez at the 5. And two 3&amp;D guards. You need space for Zion &amp; Ingram. Lonzo, Adams and Bledsoe are not a good fit for this team. If they are going to build around Ingram and Zion, coach and GM should change their system. I don't care about Lonzo's defence or Adam's rebounds. They are building the team wrong. This team will be stuck at 7-10 range for years if they keep this system."
"Offense: Steph, Harden, Lebron, Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez Defense: Jrue Holiday, Kawhi, Giannis, Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez  I feel that this is the only correct list"
Why is Brook Lopez considered a Center when he cant rebound and shoots a ton of threes?
"Pelicans also sucked, Jrue (who is the third best player on MIL) was AD's second best player and extremely injury prone. They were starting Omer Asik at center rather than Brook Lopez, Alvin Gentry coaching instead of Bud. List goes on and on.  If Giannis played with a superior playmaker he wouldn't handle the ball much if at all."
"He wouldn't be any more of a liability on D than half those players you mentioned on your list. KAT is a poor defender, Jokic is slower and smaller than Shaq. The Nets would certainly not put KD at center if Shaq was on the floor. And Kristaps cant even guard Dwight, it would be a massacre if he went anywhere near Shaq.  If you had Shaq you wouldn't run a switch heavy defense unless you are bad coach. Milwaukee has one of the best defenses in the league with Brook Lopez on the floor and he can't move at all, he basically just stands near the rim. Denver is not a great defensive team but they still scheme to make up for Jokic. There are only a handful of bigs who can switch out on guards, it is still a huge mismatch.  Playoff teams used to have to sign 6'10"" stiffs to sit on their bench most of the season just because Shaq gets every starting center in foul trouble by the second quarter. He'd be fine today"
Rumors back then were that Presti was pretty high on Brook Lopez. So who knows.
Brook Lopez is about three months older than DeAndre Jordan
I honestly thought people were making a shitty joke when I first heard about Brook Lopez being a 3 point shooter.
Brook Lopez is close. He had an average shot distance of 5-8 ft in his first 8 years.   This year it's 18.1 feet.
"It would be better for everybody if people (including his coach offensively) just started to realize that on both ends Giannis is a 4/5 not a wing, it's just not his game, he can switch, but he can't go trough any type of screen, and with Brook Lopez playing drop, ANY screen would mean an open jumper for the ball handler, and yeah KD lit up Middleton, but at least Middleton was able to contest the shot by getting trough the screen a bit, Giannis on KD = open free throw line jumper any time KD would want.  Giannis is a help defender, who can protect the rim, help at the nail and switch, he'll never be a perimeter defender unless he loses a ton of mass.  The NBA isn't a one on one game, you can be the best one on one defender in NBA history (he's not) if you can't get trough a screen you can't guard KD"
"&gt;We actually play the Bucks style of defense,   The Bucks allow a lot of 3's though which just goes to my point and you can't really compare Brook Lopez and DeAndre at this point of their careers. Any team would kill to have Lopez on their team and that system works because they have Giannis to play as a free safety and play DPOY level help defence.   In a playoff setting where teams are scheming to expose you you'll need a lot more than DJ."
Brook Lopez
Brook Lopez
"Giannis can’t really guard KD in isolation and if you’re being honest with yourself, you want to force KD to take jumpers(as with anyone) with a hand in his face. Giannis will be best as a help defender in this matchup because he can dissuade Harden AND KD from going to the rim. If you stick him on KD full time then Harden gets to shred brook lopez when he comes in to help, or he gets to hit a pinpoint pass to an open KD when Giannis comes to help out."
The only one missing was Middleton.   Brook Lopez is about a 30% shooter so he missed one extra.  KD also shot under 50% which never happens.
"I think it's the best cast of roleplayers you could possibly give him. Middleton was playing an All-Star season last year and does so currently as well. Put up some great performances when Giannis was struggling in the playoffs. Brook Lopez is a Center _any_ Team would love to have. Spaces the floor, great offensive rebounder, great inside scorer, solid footwork and great+underrated defense. This paired with a bunch of good floorspacers - Giannis has everything he should need in my opinion. He's played a regular season that rivals the great seasons Bron and MJ put up last year, DPOY defense paired with insanely efficient offense that scaled on the entire team, resulting in an all-time great season from the Bucks altogether. He's putting up impact and stats that can keep up with Bron and I'm 100% sure that LeBron could win a ring with this squad if he was a bit younger. I know it's a tough comparison being held up to LeBron standards but Giannis played himself into that sphere in terms of stats, impact and usual dominance. It's up to him to figure it out because he is _that_ good."
"He's saying if you start Wood at the 4 with a 2018 Brook Lopez-type at C, then you could hide his defensive deficiencies enough where Wood could be an allstar.  I dont agree."
"Honestly this is on Giannis/Brook Lopez refs always look at the ball handler if a timeout is gonna be called but they both didn’t signal it, Giannis looked like he wanted to play on and was even surprised a timeout was called"
Nah Brook Lopez post up
Yeah and giannis dribbled the ball before the refs stop the game for a timeout so the ball shouldn't have advanced past half court . That's so inconsistent.  Middleton was calling timeout way before Giannis had the ball. Brook Lopez passing it didn't help their case.
That's the Brook Lopez at center special for you

"Why is George Mikan shooting 3s in this old vid- oh, that's Brook Lopez."
Has the broadcast even mentioned that Brook Lopez was a significant part of the Nets franchise for a good while
Brook Lopez was so relieved the family jewels were safe.
Let me get the replay of Brook Lopez
Bucks are shooting 21% from 3 lol Brook Lopez has bricked like 3 wide open 3’s. Bucks could easily be up 6
These Brook Lopez attempts are brutal
Fun fact: Brook Lopez is Nets all time leading scorer
Brook Lopez with the crossover lmaoooooo
Lmao why does Brook Lopez have the ultimate green light?
you are a terrible defender if brook Lopez is able to drive by you from the 3 point line
"Who are the best white big men?   Jokic, Nurkic, Kanter ?   JV?  Plumlee ?   Brook Lopez?   Zubac ?   Zeller?   Olynyk?   Adams?  Theiss?"
"I'm not super versed in Xs and Os, but haven't the Bucks had league-leading defenses with no switching and Brook Lopez in the paint for the past few years? Obviously we don't have a lot of data to show that it can work to win a championship, but the principle seems to be there."
I don't consider the Bucks legit contender this year but that's only because I think Philly and the Nets are just that much better than them.  If you have to field Brook Lopez as your center for longer than 20 minutes a game in the playoffs you aren't gonna win the chip.
This dude is the new Brook Lopez. His name is always floating around lol
Can I offer you a Brook Lopez?
Brook Lopez is a guard
no we are playing him with bobby portis brook lopez pau gasol and thanasis
But can’t the defenders just camp as well? Imagine Brook Lopez and  Jokic not needing to leave the paint
I know how so many people scoff at Mo Williams all star selection despite him being good th year prior and the year after? I think Giannis backing up Brook and helping with Lopez maximizing his skillset has more ground to stand on
"No, I think Brook Lopez guarding Bam would be a better idea..."
"Oh yeah I’m sure Brook Lopez going 1-on-1 with Goran Dragic while Giannis is guarding Butler is a great way to win the series. Bro stick to your lakers game, why tf do you bring your bleacher report level takes to just shit on the man?"
Lol Giannis had two other players on his team (Lopez and Bledsoe) make the All-Defense team with Brook Lopez also getting DPOY votes but sure Wes Matthews was the best defender!
"Gobert is a regular season defender, like Brook Lopez. Probably the best regular season defender in the league but against good teams and elite bigs he is very average."
The Bucks and Pelicans would’ve been better off if the Bucks kept one of their firsts and George Hill in the Jrue trade and traded Brook Lopez instead.
Brook Lopez did alright for the Bucks in a similar role. And he can hit jumpers
Brook Lopez special. The difference is that Brooks is a good at boxing out so his team's dreb rates is still good despite him not grabbing any rebound.
"but thats what they had to do.  in a vacuum, of course it makes no sense...as did the offer to Tyler Johnson and Alan crabbe.  but nets had no draft picks for the next 4 years when those contracts were offered.  how were they going to get quality young players? they weren't going to sign superstars or Allstars.  a 4 yr max to YOUNG guys with promise was a risk worth taking.  if they amount to something, great.  if they don't well the contract is up right when nets can start drafting players again.    and nets were brook lopez, thad young and bojan bogdanovic with no draft picks when Sean marks took over.  many GMs would have pushed that trio. lopez was up for a contract and he would have had to be maxed to stay.   what was that team winning but many gms would have just maxed lopez to try to win as many games as possible to make sure its not a top 3 pick going to Boston.  and if a GM did that then sure boston doesn't get Tatum or brown but where would nets be right now?"
"are you suggesting that a starting lineup of Wayne Ellington, Jarrett Jack, Saregy Karasev, Thaddeus Young and Brook Lopez isn't a national TV draw? smh my head"

"Brook Lopez and Donte Divincenzo, please 🙏"
"Curry, Ball, Holiday, Morris, and Lopez brothers would make a pretty dope team.  Steph/Jrue/Zo/Marcus/Brook  Melo/Seth/Justin/Markief/Robin  This could be a top 3 seed in the east"
Man seeing Jokic toy with Brook Lopez makes me wonder how on earth Robin Lopez was able to defend him
brook lopez is unplayable at this point.  there's literally nothing he can do on a basketball court at any kind of nba caliber level
dude brook lopez sucks so bad
"Dead serious. I used to work at a fancy, historic candy store. Both Robin and Brook Lopez came in when they were getting ready to play the 76ers the next night. Both dudes also spent like $200 in candy in one go.   Even in a fancy spot, 200 bucks worth of candy is a shit load."
"Brook Lopez has lost a step or two this season, Giannis has also looked disinterested or confused at times (but he's getting better) and the bench also got thinner and worse defensively."
A 2019-2020 Brook Lopez type player?
"I mean, if that’s what you want, that’s what you want. I personally don’t fault you for it, but you’re getting downvoted because most would disagree with that mentality.   Believe me, I love Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen, and D-Lo and Brook Lopez before them but if the Nets’ best chance of winning is with them on other teams, then so be it. There’s nothing stopping me from rooting for the old crew while they’re on other teams."
He should talk to Brook Lopez on what it's like to be in trade rumors for like 8 of your first 9 years.
"Brook Lopez is listed at 282lb, Zion is at 284lb. Size is pretty irrelevant here."
"Embiid, Jokic, Kat, AD, Brook Lopez, Giannis, Lebron, Kawhi are just a couple of players who consistently do work in the post or demonstrate the ability to do so at a high level. I'm for sure leaving tons out but just because the league isn't based around having a post up big man, doesn't mean that the skill is dead or that it isn't important or a valuable skill"
Need rim protection? May I interest you in Brook Lopez?
The play before this is why I hate nationally televised games. Clear foul by Brook Lopez
"A spare Brook Lopez could be handy, even if he is shitty."
He’d be a shitty brook lopez
Brook Lopez + Jokic = the worst 2021 defense possible.
"I honestly really doubt this. Shooting skill hasn't really gone up that much (ft% has stayed pretty constant, and this is the one shot hasn't really changed for 40+ years). It's just more of these players who used to take long 2's have transitioned into threes (ex. Brook Lopez).   Keep in mind, shooters like Steph and Klay shoot like 95% in open gyms. Realistically how much better can someone get? Steph is probably near the human limit of shooting to be honest."
"To be honest I give a lot of Giannis' dpoy credit to 1, how many wins the Bucks had and 2, how great Brook Lopez was last year on the defensive end. Brooke made his job easy. Add in some cherry picked stat like players shoot the worst when guarded by Giannis and you have a narrative to run with."
"He's a good contributor on offense but we're definitely better on D without him, think him like Brook Lopez"
"Channing Fry, Brook Lopez"
Brook Lopez was a sub par defender with the Nets. I believe KAT will do fairly similar or maybe better with Giannis as his pair. Easily will be one of the best  if not the best and well balance trio along with Khris Middleton.
"Brook Lopez, a little too much."
"Also in this era, Yao would 100% be taking threes. He had the same range dudes like Marc Gasol and Brook Lopez had before they started shooting 3s so there’s no doubt Yao could.  7’6” pick and pop guy would be amazing"
"One day Shaq hates the new school centres and thinks the centre position is dead  The next day Shaq praise guys like Brook Lopez, Jokic and Embiid on the basis of simply playing one great game"
Brook Lopez on steroids
Brook Lopez
"He praised Bynum, Brook Lopez, Embiid, and KAT in the past"
"Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. I remember a season where Brook Lopez was selected as an injury replacement for Rajon Rondo."
"Brook Lopez plays stretch 5, which isn’t the same as a shooting guard."
"That's because Brook Lopez is actually a good defender. If he takes the top of the key three, he's the first one back on defense."
"Brook Lopez and Patrick Connington, lol."
"&gt; So it makes him a misfit everywhere, when people try to pretend he’s actually a fit anywhere.  I mean, that should still allow him to be a fit anywhere, just not a $30M fit. Brook Lopez plays like a 7-foot SG on offense and he'd fit into most teams' systems - just not for $30M."
"They’re not very fast, but that’s not the fault of the white guys.   Brook Lopez is slow as hell tho."
Brook Lopez in shambles
They should trade him to the Bucks for a real center like Brook Lopez!
"I would do everything in my power to get Myles Turner on the team as long as it didn't cost Zion, Ingram, Lonzo, or Hart if Indiana is as willing to trade him as it seems they've been for a couple years now. Allows Zion to be a center on offense with a rim protector behind him on defense, like Giannis with Brook Lopez.   A core of Lonzo, Hart, Ingram, Zion, and Turner could be really nice for a long time"
"Its pretty shitty timing with your recent skid but yeah obviously you would be heavily favoured in that series, but the matchup actually isn't ideal for you.  Our weakness is true centers that can take advantage of our lack of size inside. That's why we struggled against the Wolves of all teams, we just have nobody who can physically match up with KAT. Giannis on the other hand is someone that Siakam or OG could reasonably check, and Brook Lopez is completely unplayable in that series as he wouldn't be able to guard Siakam Anunoby or Boucher, and he's just not the offensive player he used to be where he would burn us on the other end (Boucher was able to block his shot several times when we played). Middleton has also struggled against the Raptors historically, and Jrue Holiday won't have slow footed defenders to attack in the pick and roll, as he's going to see Anunoby Siakam or Boucher on the 1/5 pick and roll.  Again, on paper you *should* still win, but that was true about your last two playoff outings so we will see. I think I'd be more confident in the Bucks once I see how they bounce back from this recent skid"
"&gt; DAJ = Lopez &gt;  &gt;   Wait what is Brook that terrible this year? Because aside from last night and a few moments here and there, DeAndre Jordan has been absolutely horrible. Like, worst player in the league type of horrible. Brook would have wide open threes for days with Jordan on the floor."
"Yep, him and Brook Lopez."
They should definitely trade him straight up for an all-star big like Brook Lopez 👍
Jimmy Butler. They should trade him to the Bucks for Brook Lopez and DJ Augustin
You should check out 7-footer Brook Lopez
Probably Darryl Dawkins. Kenyon Martin had an all star game and Brook Lopez still has some years left
Does Brook Lopez count? cuz i'd add brook lopez
"Ah yes, the Brook Lopez phenomenon"
Come to the Bucks please I can’t stand watching Brook Lopez play basketball
His dunk on Brook Lopez is better tbh
Some but it’s overstated it’s a lot of the same help defense principles. Brook Lopez older and getting exploited a lot but it’s the same idea of allow tons of 3s at the top of the key because there’s nobody to help get out on them it’s the same drop coverage with some tweaks here and there like switching more in some games
"Here's my attempt. I put slashes where I thought there was some debate or was uncertain:   * Thunder: CP3, Harden, PG, KD, Adams/Ibaka.  * Hornets: Kemba, Dell Curry, Glen Rice, Larry Johnson, Alonzo Mourning.  * Pacers: Reggie Miller, PG, Danny Granger, Jermaine O'Neal, Roy Hibbert/Rik Smits.  * Jazz: John Stockton, Donovan Mitchell/Deron Williams, Adrian Dantley, Karl Malone, Rudy Gobert.  * Clippers: CP3, World B. Free/Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Blake Griffin, Bob McAdoo.  * Pelicans: CP3, Jrue Holiday, Brandon Ingram, Anthony Davis, David West.  * Nets: Jason Kidd/Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Vince Carter/Drazen Petrovic, Kevin Durant, Brook Lopez.  * Suns: Steve Nash, Devin Booker, Shawn Marion, Charles Barkley, Amar'e Stoudemire. * Nuggets: Fat Lever/Chauncey Billups, David Thompson, Alex English, Carmelo Anthony, Nikola Jokic/Dan Issel.  * Magic: Penny Hardaway, Tracy McGrady, Rashard Lewis, Hedo Turkoglu, Shaq.  * Timberwolves: Stephon Marbury, Sam Cassell, Jimmy Butler, Kevin Garnett, Karl-Anthony Towns. * Grizzlies: Mike Conley, Tony Allen, Shane Battier/Rudy Gay, Zach Randolph, Marc Gasol"
oh yeah you're good i was replying to Lopez trying to take responsibility for it and Giannis storming off like he was mad at Brook
"- Offer Harris for Myles Turner and pray the Pacers accept it, throw in Shamet to sweeten the deal  - Not an elite rim protector, but Lamarcus Aldridge is at least a big body they can throw in the paint and can be got for Harris + filler  - Bucks fans have been wanting to trade Brook Lopez, it’s possible they can make a run at him  - Also not elite, but a deal with Steven Adams might benefit both teams  Just to spitball a few names. I may have exaggerated the amount of true elite rim protectors on the market, but they definitely need a big body when their main competition in the east are Embiid and Giannis"
Not sure why they completely changed up the defense when that was their strongest trait. Now you have Brook Lopez running around in quick sand trying to close out perimeter shooters. it's fucking dumb.
Kyle had a hell of a game that game and the brook lopez just got hot in the fourth quarter.
"Ok max lakers and nets them 6, max. Since they playing in this era u have to take these players production in the 90s and increase them. Reggie and Stockton would easily act 25+ and 20+ ppg respectively. Horry and robinson are versatile wings/small bigs, DRob is a top 30 player ever who had a mid range, Majerle is a scoring 3nD dude, laimbeer is a physical brook Lopez, and kukoc is a 6MOY at 6-11 who can dribble pass and shoot"
What about Brook Lopez? 🤠
"Brook Lopez had one of the best post games in the league, now I feel old."
"Embiid, Turner, Bam, AD (if you count him there), Brook Lopez last year? Plenty of defensive center competition"
Siakam was a non factor for years against Giannis who is a longer stronger and quicker version of him. Bud suddenly decided it's a good idea to put Brook Lopez on him and keep Giannis at the corner away from the action. Brook can't guard noone anymore away from the rim and made Siakam look like an all star. Bud figured it out late in the second game when Giannis was already in foul trouble.
"Right, I understand but one of the analytics guys was on a Knicks pod (Partnow IIRC) and said in the regular season its hard to scheme for particular shooters. I dont remember all the details but it seems like they dug into it so i kind of think there is something to it. If its a guy like Giannis Im sure everyone knows you can can sag right off but if its between like Pat Connaughton and Brook Lopez its probably harder for the defense to scheme for and really you dont want either shooting wide open.  I really dont know though. I dont think analytics can explain everything so while some of the shooting might be luck I also think there is something to just playing hard and getting guys off their spots. Teams shot the lights out against us every game last year and there was no ""luck adjustment."" When you suck you just suck because ""you let the team get in rhythm so of course they are going to shoot well."" No one this year is giving us credit for ""playing high effort and physical so teams cant get into rhythm."" Double standard in my opinion."
Bucks finally benched Brook Lopez and they look way more competent.
Middleton is fine but brook lopez might need to be traded. The dude has the turning circle of the International space station
Brook Lopez seriously looks lost out there.
Aron Baynes is outplaying Brook Lopez. Yikes!
Brook Lopez
Brook Lopez
1. Very cool 2. “One of the Lopez brothers” — brook lopez! But some respect on his name! Nets all time leading scorer!
A lot of the bucks roleplayers like George Hill and Brook Lopez are old and unsurprisingly had horrible conditioning come bubble time. The Bucks also kickstarted the BLM protest. A lot of them probably didn't want to play. Look at their 8 seeding games too. The Bucks team in the bubble was not the same as the one pre-bubble.
"Memes aside. If Brook Lopez can go from never shooting in an NBA game to becoming a damn near elite shooter, I'm sure at some point in his career, Ben Simmons can settle in between.   The problem is, he doesn't seem like he actually wants to."
"They had 3 wins before Rodman and Kukoc ever showed up.  Horace Grant and BJ Armstrong were both All Stars. Craig Hodges was a 2 time 3 point champion and shot 43% from deep from the mid 80s to his retirement after he wore a daishiki to the white house and got blackballed out the league. Bill Cartwright was a consistent 18-20 pp36 guy a la Brook Lopez before going to Chicago. The whole team was full of above average players, and later on Grant, BJ, and Scottie became great players."
"People also said that when Brook Lopez started hitting threes. Could go either way. When you have good form, it's all about getting touch."
"so was brook lopez, who get’s targeted on defense this season"
"Kidd, Channing Frye and Brook Lopez?  I think that's about all the players I remember coming into the league (for as long as I've been watching ball) that couldn't shoot that were able to significantly improve. Short list."
"https://theathletic.com/1505070/2020/01/03/analytics-lookaround-replacement-shots-redux-rim-protection-and-some-thoughts-on-early-all-star-voting-returns/  https://www.stitcher.com/show/locked-on-bucks/episode/seth-partnow-joins-lob-to-talk-bucks-defense-brook-lopez-dpoty-claims-offensive-diversity-and-playoff-matchups-76749282   Keep in mind this is coming from someone who literally worked for the Bucks.  &gt; you have yet to offer any reason why Giannis wasn't the best player last season - you've just said so.  What? We can plainly see looking back that Giannis wasn't the best player in the NBA last year as evidenced by his playoff performance. And yes, the MVP is a regular season award but clearly the playoffs clarified that the metrics supporting Giannis' case as the best player in the NBA were misleading when he failed to perform at that level in the postseason."
I still think about that Brook Lopez miss from feet away to give the Warriors their first L that season. Might be time to rewatch lol
"I feel like having an all Balkan team and all USA team isn't the same though because the Balkans are \~1/4 of Europe, population size highly benefits team USA. You could do the all-region USA v All-Balkan.   You'd have for the West Coast;   C: Brook Lopez or Christian Wood  PF: Kawhi Leonard  SF: Paul George   SG: James Harden  PG: Damian Lillard  &amp;#x200B;  vs All Balkan Peninsula of:   C: Nikola Jokic  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo (even though I don't consider Greece culturally similar to traditional Balkan countries)  SF: Bojan Bogdanovic  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic  PG: Luka Dončić  &amp;#x200B;  That's a way closer matchup. I think I'd put my money on team West Coast but it's not a landslide."
You guys can have Brook Lopez if you want...
"Turner is bigger Theis. Or shittier Brook Lopez. Nonetheless, I'd want that on my team."
Yeah like Brook Lopez   ^please ^somebody ^just ^trade ^for ^him
Donte is a decent 3 and D player but he is 24 which is not old but also not very young by any means. I think he will end up being a decent player with averages of like 12-13 points on 40% shooting. I think the best comparison for Donte would be Luke Kennard. Both were solid 3rd year players but not great and not future all star caliber player. Luke Kennard went for the 19th overall pick and I would say that’s pretty fair value for Donte.   Brook is 32 and while his contract is not bad it is not that attractive. Next 2 seasons he will be making 27.2 million and the question is that do I really want to be putting 14 million into my cap space for Brook Lopez? He’s not a negative asset but he certainly is not a very attractive one given his age and how he is a pretty bad rebounder. I can’t see Brook Lopez being a very attractive asset and more so be salary filler   As for your trades there is no way Charlotte gives up Rozier who is balling out and biyombo for that package.   As for the second package I don’t think Milwaukee does that. Ricky Rubio looks super washed this year and his numbers look awful even on a garbage Timberwolves team   I think a good target for them would be Terrance Ross. He can create his own shot pretty well and he can get very hot very fast. Past 2 playoff runs for the Magic he is also averaging 15 points on 56 TS
Brook Lopez is 32 years old and is honestly not the kind of center we need. Also Terry is literally the best catch and shoot player in the league out of 27 ppl who qualify and have over 100 attempts.
"Probably Vince Carter.   I would've said Brook Lopez a month ago, but between the Claxton emergence, DeAndre benching, and Blake/LMA signings, I think Carter now would be the bigger boost."
"The lack of defense isn't because of a lack of effort, it is that today's schemes, shooting, and spacing is impossible to defend.    Imagine the 97 or 98 Jazz, but playing today's style.   Stockton would take 10+ threes a game and hit 40%+ Malone would be rolling at the rim with no help defense because Ostertag would be replaced with a center like Brook Lopez, Marc Gasol, or Serge Ibaka that forces his defender out to the 3 point line.   Byron Russell and Jeff Hornacek both hit 40%+ from 3 at 5+ shots per game (Jeff was over 40% in 98, but both had multiple seasons over 40%)  That team would be way better on offense than they were, and they were a good offensive team, and only Ostertag is out of the picture.  Everyone else settled for midrange jumpers because they they didn't know better (its kinda dumb that they didn't know better, it's obvious that 40%×3=1.2 &gt; 50%×2=1.0).  Even in those same rules against those same defenders of the 90s, that team would score way more using today's style of play."
He was guarded by Brook Lopez. Middleton is guarded Kawhi.
Brook Lopez was absolutely cooking us there for a stretch.  No idea why y'all didn't just keep feeding him...
Why is Brook Lopez guarding Looney at the 3 point line lol
Brook Lopez. Kind of a liability.
"Brook Lopez was the only “roster shake up”...  Bro idk how to tell you this, no coach is the major reason you jump from a 13th seed to a 1st seed in the league"
"I watched this video twice and I'm still waiting for the part where Brook Lopez gets ""cooked"""
"For the Bucks, [I’d love this trade.](https://tradenba.com/trades/NOwOcZD90)   Bucks get: Draymond Green  Warriors get: Pat Connaughton, Donte Divencenzo, and PJ Washington  Hornets: get Brook Lopez, 1st round top 5 protected Milwaukee pick (the soonest one MIL can give up after the Jrue deal)  Why do the Bucks say yes?  Draymond Green is the perfect player for this Bucks team. With Draymond, we have a lineup of Jrue/Middleton/MLE Starter(PJ Tucker again maybe?)/Giannis/Draymond, and that’s guaranteed the number one defense even if Jabari Parker is the starter to be named later. Dray fits in perfect defensively, as Giannis can go back to the free safety role and terrorize while Draymond protects the rim and the paint and Jrue and Mids lock up the perimeter.   Offensively, Dray fits in as the main facilitator. Giannis and Jrue are okay to good as facilitators, but adding Draymond gives the offense a whole new dimension where Khris and Jrue play as off ball shooters while Giannis and Dray play a two man game.  Dray is an upgrade over Brook, and it sucks losing Donte and Patty Cakes, but the upgrade is worth it and I believe makes us top tier title contenders, which is something we are not with Brook Lopez starting.  Why do the Warriors do it?  Giving up the heart and soul of your dynasty isn’t ideal, but you’re getting 3 quality players back, 2 of whom still have great upside. We’ve heard all year how the bench is weak, and it’s their downfall, because, well, it is.  Now with Klay coming back you have Steph/Klay/Wigs/PJ/Wiseman with Donte as a perfect 6th man/Klay recovery fill-in, and another solid bench guy in Pat Connaughton. Also, they have MIN’s 1st and their own. It’s possible they have a Steph/Klay/Cade/Kuminga/Wiseman lineup if the lottery falls perfectly for them.   And even if it doesn’t, they’ll still in theory add 2 NBA caliber players in the draft. This year they have 3.5 competent players (Steph, Wigs, Dray, .5Looney), if they did this trade, next year they’d have (Steph, Klay, Wigs, PJ, Pat, Donte, GS pick, MN pick, .5Looney, .5Wiseman). So they go from 3 quality players to 9 (and 10 if Wiseman develops), restoring their depth from the title days. Replacing Dray with a young PJ Washington and adding two high quality bench guys that will mollywop other bench units. All of a sudden their bench goes from the steaming pile of dump it is this year, to a bench lineup of Poole/Donte/Pat/Paschall/Looney, a top bench lineup in the whole league to go along with world class starters.  Why do the Hornets do this?  Well, simple. You’re upgrading at a spot where you need to, and getting a 1st round pick. You’re the benefactor of having PJ Washington as a piece that GS wants over Brook Lopez, all the while Lopez helps you too.  Lopez is a clear upgrade over Zeller, and Melo/Rozier/Bridges/Hayward/Lopez is a playoff lineup for sure. Brook is tailor made to play with Melo, pick and pops would be deadly, and Lopez is great in the post which becomes an enhanced skill with Melo throwing entry passes to him.   PJ is a good young player, but Lopez helps you more now, and you get a 1st as well. No brainer."
Being able to move even a little and jump higher than 6 inches while playing against Brook Lopez is just what the doctor ordered.
"He had a great game but playing drop coverage with Brook Lopez on him is probably the easiest defense for him to exploit. Just ask for a screen to get Jrue away from him and shoot an open look. Miami and the Raptors destroyed us with FVV, Dragic, Hero, Robinson doing just that for a whole series. Bud is just too stubborn to change it."
Bud gonna draw up the play for Brook Lopez lmao
"Brook ""Kyle Anderson"" Lopez"
"Hard disagree, we went from bottom ten to top of the league in one offseason a couple years ago and it wasn’t because we swapped John Henson for Brook Lopez."
Brook Lopez &amp; George Hill are still decent
-Chris Paul's height  -Gobert's shooting  -Brook Lopez sprint speed  -Trae Young's defense  -Dwight Howard's passing
Brook Lopez feels like a sneaky elite player. He just doesn’t seem to do anything bad other than get posterized. But that’s a family curse.
"Do past prime stars count?  If so 18/19 Gasol  Super high IQ, defends with size inside, makes threes, amazing passer and can even have the ball thrown to him in the post in a pinch   18/19 Brook Lopez as well for similar reasons"
"Theres also just not that many actual 7 footers in the league these days but Brook lopez, markkanen, mitchell robinson all seem to be pretty mid tier guys"
Unrelated but Brook and Robin Lopez with over 230 mil in salary in their careers. Wow
They can defend it if Brook Lopez plays limited minutes.  He should only play if Nets play Claxton or DAJ.
"At this point, Brook Lopez"
"I agree Harell better than Faried but they have awfully close career trajectories, sizes, and skillsets. Except Montrez is much better at creating for himself in the post(72nd percentile with 0.98 points per post-up possession in 2019-20) and after looking at the analytics he's actually a decent rim protector, holding opponents to 51.4 percent shooting when he contests at the rim but his defensive deficiencies are related to his defensive iq and partially his size(can't guard in the post and gets defensive rebounds at a bad rate in the 18th percentile). These deficiencies were especially highlighted against [dominant big men like Jokic as we saw in the last clipper nuggets](https://youtu.be/J1WEE7EW1wc).   Look I love the passion Trez brings to the Lakers but there's a reason he's a 6th man of the year and struggled to get a big payday this summer. He has a place in this league but without an outside shot and most of his shots coming assisted he seems an awful lot like Faried and it's not just because of their majestic locks haha. Even at .98 points per post up, a stretch 5 like Brook Lopez just needs to shoot 33 percent from 3 to match that efficiency and while doing so brings the opposing center out of the paint freeing up the lane for drive and kicks."
"Brook lopez , terrible at defence with his speed and highly  weak on switch defence and always low on defence. Also a very weak rebounder    Only got size going for him and able to space the floor, the players around him especially giannis always cover his defensive weakness"
My guy moves like brook lopez
"Uh, what? That team had Kemba, Mitchell, Brook Lopez, Tatum, etc. That's a good team."
Brook Lopez is also a brown adult who’s favorite place in the world is Disney Land
Brook Lopez said the same thing about Jrue
I'd say this is the least athletic team of players that get at least 26 min per game:  PG- Ricky Rubio  SG- Joe Harris  SF- Joe Ingles  PF- Kelly Olynyk  C- Brook Lopez
I'd say this is the least athletic team of players that get at least 26 min per game:  PG- Ricky Rubio  SG- Joe Harris  SF- Joe Ingles  PF- Kelly Olynyk  C- Brook Lopez

"A real stretch 5 isn't a center shooting 30% from three though. A real stretch 5 is a guy like KAT, Embiid, Jokic who will hit 40% on you if you leave them wide open, and guys like Aldridge and Marc Gasol before this season.   A Brook Lopez is no stretch 5"
"Argentina beat USA with a team that had basically no NBA players in 2019. I'm not sure how many players exactly in their team is in Euroleague now but I'm sure it'll be somewhat competitive. For reference here's the team USA squad that year  &gt; The official 2019 USA World Cup Team includes 2016 Olympic gold medalist **Harrison Barnes** (Sacramento Kings); **Jaylen Brown** (Boston Celtics); **Joe Harris** (Brooklyn Nets); **Brook Lopez** (Milwaukee Bucks); **Khris Middleton** (Milwaukee Bucks); **Donovan Mitchell** (Utah Jazz); 2014 World Cup gold medalist **Mason Plumlee** (Denver Nuggets), **Marcus Smart** (Boston Celtics); **Jayson Tatum** (Boston Celtics); **Myles Turner** (Indiana Pacers); **Kemba Walker** (Boston Celtics); and **Derrick White** (San Antonio Spurs).   Not great, but still respectable. If we are going by the worst of the NBA, e.g. Rockets, I think that Euro will win."
"Credit to luke walton for the interesting barnes at the 5 lineup with 6 mins left in the 4th I was scratching my head at it when I first saw the bucks immediately get a look at the rim+ rebound+ free throws then barnes struggling with his brick feet to get by brook on the other end but it ended up working really well for a few minutes. Bucks after that first possession couldn't figure it out and barnes even without being able to capitalize himself took Lopez out of the paint , kings got some easy drives+ buddy hit a couple 3s and bucks lead was gone.       Just think he left it out there a little too long it became clear jrue started punishing it with 2 mins left, drew 2 fouls and got a bucket and by that point it was pretty much over."
"Geez man, those two timeouts the officials gave the Bucks were brutal. Yikes, those never get called like that and it happens twice in the last minute or so, both of which were probably turnovers for the Kings.  That being said, obviously the Bucks are the better team even without Giannis. Jrue is so good man, and of course Brook Lopez with his annual pop-off against the Kings lol"
Blazers that interior D is looking a bit suspect. Can I offer you a slightly used Brook Lopez?
Brook Lopez
"He wasn't a poor defender until 2017, he was gambling way too much but still at the very worst average.  And about the box out what do you thin, Giannis rebounding got so much ""better"" once he started playing with Brook Lopez (and even better again wth Robin Lopez) ? I've never seen anyone have a problem with that weirdly ?  Why do you think Tristan Thompson's rebounding got so much better once Lebron left ?   Were you there when Harden was on the floor during garbage time multiple games to keep his 30 points streak alive 2 years ago ?  Or when Rondo was litterally giving up 2 lay ups per game to get assists ?  Or is it just bad because it allowed Westbrook to get to 10 rebounds a game ?  And again even if he was the worst stad padder of all time which he might very well be, it's not the same at all as an empty stats guy."
"Thinking basketball discussed this last year. Bulky rim protectors like Brook Lopez are replaceable, his own brother Robin was able to sustain his impact on defense without much hassle, though it did go down by a tiny margin.  We were best when both Giannis and Brook were on the floor, but we we still the best with Giannis, and middle of the pack without him.  Impact is really subjective, Giannis does a lot of what Embiid does and more. He’s one of the best and statistically the most lethal rim protector in the league. He held opponents to 36.4% at the rim last season; Rudy Gobert and Embiid were in the high 40s"
"Why did Lakers give up Dwight *and* McGee? We already fucked up losing Brook Lopez for nothing. Now we're trying all we can to replace a piece we already had with Marc, Damian Jones, and Andre but with much worse luck."
"Better centers. Jo Jo, Jokic, Vucivic, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, Porzingis, Drummond, Allen, Nurkic, Aldridge, KAT, Ayton, Gobert, Steven Adams, Clint Capella, Christian Wood Ehhh bout the same: Mason Plumlee, Time Lord, Noel, Poetl, Claxton, Kanter."
"I can see that, but it's sad to see giannis full potential can't be realized this year since bucks defensive scheme is easily exposed with brook lopez deteriorating this year and there's always lack of rotation on defence and confusion.  When giannis is off the floor, the offence and defence kinda look stunned."
Who has ever said I grew up being a fucking nets fan? Or has anyone said i've idolised brook lopez?
"Gobert and AD have held Embiid to 23.8 and 21.6 ppg respectively. So I’ll give it to them bc that’s below his average.   AD doesn’t always guard Embiid in matchups, but enough that I’ll count it.  Embiid averages 26.5 ppg against Giannis. But Giannis almost never guards Embiid (outside of switches) and when he does he routinely gets torched by him. So does Brook Lopez who primarily gets this assignment in these games, which is more what the stat reflects than what Giannis does against him defensively."
"1. Brook Lopez, All-Defensive Team  2. Dwight, ex-superstar who still has it. Also a glue guy and a contributor to our championship  3. Zubac, a solid big man, traded for I can't even remember who  4. T Bryant, who started for Wizards.   I count 4 ..."
that’s Brook Lopez’ music
Take Brook Lopez
"There were 3 plumlees at one point too, but I guess mason is the only one now   Cody and Caleb Martin  Brook and Robin Lopez   Steph and Seth curry.   The Morris twins  The Hernangomez brothers  Jalen and Jaden McDaniels  The Ball Boys"
"Nah I'm good dont worry. I live in a poor city. You can probably figure out which one by looking at my profile. I rent a 2 bedroom house for under 500/month. Thats what I meant by life changing. I dont make a ton of money, but for my city I do ok and its very very low COL. Ive always made really good money on 1st score, going back... 8ish years now. $800 on Dawson Knox in the afccg on $40, $600 on gronk in the sb, hit on Isaiah Mckenzie on the Bills twice when his odds were above +4000 last season. And those are only a few, I could name about a dozen more just from last NFL season alone. Im... phenomenal at figuring out game plans and that may sound snotty but oh well, it true. 1st score, the odds are so high i only ever have to spend $20-40. Ive only been at it for NBA like 3 weeks, If you check my post history, even before that hit, I posted a miss i had, got 2/3 specifically saying I'm getting closer and closer every night...thats only one night where I got 2/3. I got 2/3 Four nights in a row until FINALLY hitting (getting impatient on +55000 odds. That it took a whole 3 weeks). I got 2/3 again last night, kristaps and Jerami Grant were my 2 guys. I should've just thrown 10 on just those 2, but I tossed them on tickets with Brook Lopez, Morris on LA, Joe Harris etc. Got greedy.  4k is practically life changing in now I have some breathing room. I can make these bets for the next 30 days in a row, not hit a single thing and not worry (spend $20-40 a night). That ain't gonna happen. But its just 4k is by far the largest amount I've ever won and now I can try and take another step up with these bets. Instead of winning 2200 on $4, im gonna be able to put $6 on it, make it a 4k win. Once I hit another one, I'll be able to do $10. And so on. Slowly but smartly. I appreciate the concern but im good. If I can keep doing what I've been doing I can actually start looking at buying a house"
"This rise started with trading Brook Lopez for D'Lo years ago. The team didn't have their own first round pick for 5 years, and we were the laughing stock of the league while Sean Marks built the fun team we saw in 2018. KD said that team and the culture was a big reason why he signed.   I don't wanna hear anything about buying a championship. This shit was earned."
I miss Brook Lopez.

TIL Brook Lopez stepping on you is the equivalent force of a boulder
"If Brook Lopez married Robin Lopez, that would be considered incest."
Dude got posterized by Brook Lopez 😂😂😂
Brook Lopez
Not on brook Lopez but I wouldn't mind him posting up guards on switches.  We won't really get better shots than that with LeBron and AD out.
"Brook lopez overrated defender in the pnr, hes just good as a rim protector during drop coverage."
Re-signing Jrue is obviously the current issue but I'm more interested to see if they run Giannis at 5 to counter Brook Lopez falling off.  Dude turns 33 tomorrow and is under contract for 3-more years. He's shot under league average from 3 for the past 2 seasons and teams are starting to figure out how to exploit his slow-footedness.
"No, 2019 buck was the best. Mirotic, bledsoe, ersan ilyasova , brogdon , brook lopez who is still really good and emerging khris . The team was really stacked and nobody had real game plan to stop giannis during that time until they blew 2-0 lead to raptor and everyone was being terrible at shooting during that playoff series except brook lopez"
"I feel like they were a bit ahead of the curve.  Durant of course was a no-brainer but I remember being surprised at both the Harden and Westbrook picks.  My recollection is that in 2008 Brook Lopez, Jerryd Bayless, Love, and Eric Gordon were expected to go ahead of Westbrook.  And that Rubio was expected to be the third player taken in 2009, with Harden being in a big glut with Tyreke, Curry, DeRozan, Jonny Flynn, Jordan Hill, and maybe a couple others."
"This seems right.  The Lakers are just a few seasons removed from the Mozgov and Deng signings. They sold low on D'Lo's contract for Brook Lopez, then let Brook walk for nothing.  For a cash-strapped (ironic for billionaire owners) small market team, that can be consignment to purgatory. For the Lakers, it was just a brief, unfortunate interlude until 2 of the top 10 players joined them."
"Compare that to the Boston trade. When that trade happened KG was 37, Paul Pierce was 36, and Jason Terry was 36. All three were clearly on their way out.   The Nets also had one of the worst GMs in sports and the only quality player under the age of 25 was Brook Lopez.   It's pretty obvious why these two situations are different."
"Durant gets taken there by 32 of 32 teams, so he definitely doesn't get credit for that one.  But Westbrook was not at all the obvious choice - in fact he was quite surprising.  Mocks had him down lower in the Top 10 - everybody thought the Sonics/Thunder were taking Brook Lopez as they needed a Center.   Harden was again a bit more ""duh, obvious"" given that they took Westbrook the prior year and thus Rubio wouldn't have made any sense."
doubt we do when we willingly employ brook lopez
The man can hardly defend brook lopez on the perimeter.. this is just going to end poorly
Reggie Evans was a product of Brook Lopez.
"i'm biased, but yes. a couple years ago it was brook lopez but zu's way better at this point imo"
Brook Lopez and getting out rebounded
"Durant basically missed the season in 2015 with a similar injury requiring multiple surgeries. Pau had surgery on his in 2006, missed the whole offseason (international tournaments etc.), basically seemed like he was out for 3ish months. A few guys (Durant, Ricky Davis, Brook Lopez come to mind) reinjured themselves and missed way more time than the initial recovery.   It seems likely that the best option will be to sit Robinson for the year and make sure it's fully healed. Anything they get out of him this season needs to be treated like an unexpected bonus.  Also tough to stay in playing shape with a foot injury."
Kornet looks like Brook Lopez out there goddamn
Lakers had almost a decade of terrible decisions and but all they had to do was keep cap space available for a superstar free agent to save them.   - drafting lonzo over tatum  - overpaying deng and mozgov - cutting brook Lopez   Are some of the series of bad lakers gm decisions during their dark phase w/o superstars forcing their way there
"Five years ago, the Lakers had Kobe, the Nets had prime Brook Lopez, and the Knicks had Melo. Not exactly a bunch of nobodies."
The Anti Brook Lopez
Hes basically the younger more athletic Brook Lopez
"Brook Lopez can barely move, cut him some slack"
Everyone except the media who voted slow footed pbr defender brook lopez over og last year when the raptors were revolutionizing modern day defense.
U barely beat Brook Lopez and 4 scrubs.   Sad to hear about Mitch :(
"At a guess, SVG fell in love with the idea of Milwaukee's defence and thought Adams could be Brook Lopez on defence.  Whether it's that Adams can't be Brook Lopez, or the lack of Giannis that causing the defensive problem is an open question. It's probably both."
"The combined salary of our entire line-up was $23 million. We ran the minimum allowed number of players, and one month ago half of them were in the G-League. Outside of Brook Lopez our starting 5 combined for 2 previous starts. Your team was handicapped, but I have never seen our team before."
"&gt;Also, Brook Lopez gets such a fucking garbage whistle it's annoying to watch.  nah dude he’s just bad"
"It definitely got Thanasty in this one.  Also, Brook Lopez gets such a fucking garbage whistle it's annoying to watch.  And the worst thing is watching a ref fuck up and then compound their fuck up by giving a tech to the player or coach for telling them they fucked up."
"&gt; It's been that way since the New Jersey Nets of the 2000s. They've always been known to have the best medical staff in the league. It sort of makes up for the horrible scouting, coaching and other staff they had in those times. Dr. Riley Williams, one of the top orthopedic surgeon in the world, had been their medical director since the Kidd era, and it's quality all the way down to the trainers.   &gt; As for examples, besides the obvious Durant recovery from a potential career ending injury, Dr. Riley did the ACL surgery with Dinwiddie now, fixed Claxton's shoulders (labrum injury), ankle injury on Richard Jefferson,  wrist injury with Richard Jefferson, Brook Lopez foot injury, and knee injury for D'Angelo Russell. I think most of those, if not all those players returned from injury in top form, besides Dinwiddie who's not back yet. Dr. Riley is also the head medical director for Team USA basketball when they play because he's just the best around. A lot of what he does too is injury prevention, so he has prevented aggravating injuries like what happened to KD in GS, and had his trainers make players do a stretch routine that loosens them up so they don't get injured as frequently.  &gt; Anyway, that's not to say other teams like the Mavs and Suns don't have great medical staff, it's just that the Nets have the best orthopedic surgeon around running their medical department, and fans may not know that, but the players definitely do."

"Bryn Forbes (killed us last game *badly*), Thanasis Antetokounmpo (former Knick), Brook Lopez (former crosstown rival when he was w/ the Nets), Sam Merill,  Jordan Nwora, Axel Toupane, Mamadi Diakite, and someone else I might not know"
Winning is fun. Pat Ewing was a great but never enough. JKidd was acquired through trade and our best draft pick since was Brook Lopez. It’s a fantasy to do it all by way of the draft.
i try to convince myself the same (new jersey nets and brook lopez fan)
"What are you on about? The kid is averaging 26 ppg on a historically great TS% and you're claiming he is all hype? You're just a hater. There have been many players that have been able to develop a three-ball over time. If Brook Lopez managed to become a good shooter, Zion sure as hell can too. You're acting like he has been in the league for 5 years already. Get over yourself and stop hating on a young kid like him."
"My guess:   Sam Merrill-Bryn Forbes-Pat Connaughton-Thanasis-Brook Lopez as the starters  Axel Toupane - Jordan Nwora -Mamadi Diakite as the bench.  Eight man rotation, Bucks have two open roster spots in addition to all these players being out, so lots of minutes for everyone there."
Time for Brook Lopez to drop 50 points
"The main problem with the Bucks last year is that we had like 5 or 6 vets who literally washed out halfway through the year. The wheels just came off Korver, Ersan, Matthews, Bledsoe, RoLo, Hill and Marvin Williams, and even Brook Lopez started falling apart towards the end of the season. They all went from good player to bad player overnight"
"It's still crazy how Brook Lopez was the franchise player for the Nets, and he use to average a double double."
Fun fact: Brook and Robin Lopez were also named after words
"The Bucks defense in the playoffs will always worry me because they rely so heavily on a traditional center in Brook Lopez. Traditional bigs are always susceptible to being exploited on the perimeter in switches. Milwaukee's best defensive lineups, IMO, are going to feature Giannis at center, but I don't know how willing Bud is to do that."
"Thought you meant Lebron was ahead in the MVP race too. Giannis has a better Defensive box plus/minus as well. Giannis is the anchor of his teams defense as well especially with the rapid decline of Brook Lopez this season. He has been a better significantly rim protector as usual while also going more to the perimeter this year . He has even improved his instincts from last year when he won DPOY as he takes far less charges and such. Giannis has a higher DRB%, STL%, and BLK% too."
"Jaren's numbers are great.  You just love outdated stats like individual rebounds, [which are pretty much irrelevant to predicting team success based on modern understanding](https://www.poundingtherock.com/2018/9/13/17813602/san-antonio-difficulty-understanding-importance-rebounding).  When you look at the team stats, no sub that we have had for Jaren changes the team's contested rebounding rate (same this year as last year), including Clarke who is supposed to be a good rebounder.  Players like Marc Gasol and Brook Lopez are others who tended to not collect a lot of rebounds but were nonetheless known to not drag down or even improve the team rebounding rates, particularly after they developed three point shots.  On the offensive side of the ball, every scoring metric is close between the two players:   USG% 23 Jaren vs 21 Ayton, TS% 59 vs 60, efG 55 vs 56.   And Jaren does it in a way that's more difficult to find on the open market.  I've already heard Nate Duncan refer to Jaren as one of the best shooting big men of all time, and that's because he understands that degree of difficulty matters.  It puts insane pressure on the defense to be shooting 26 footers with confidence and a quick release, and it bails the offense out of otherwise bad possessions.  There is a reason almost every MEM player is experiencing a drop in offensive efficiency this year, and it's because Jaren isn't there.  &amp;#x200B;  It's the same story on defense.  DRTG 108 vs 110 (lower is better), DWS/48 0.0613 VS 0.054, DBPM 0.5 vs -0.6 (Jaren's further ahead in a couple of those categories than even I suspected).  Even the most cutting edge one I've seen (538's DRAYMOND rating) favors Jaren 1.5 vs 0.6, although they have only have data through the 2019 season that I could find.  And while you Suns fans like to claim that Ayton is ""switchable"", there are degrees to these things, it's not binary.  Ayton is switchable in the sense that he doesn't complete poop his pants if swapped onto a guard, but you wouldn't want to scheme it this way, he's always going to be better in some sort of traditional defense.  Jaren is switchable in the sense that you could play him easily and confidently in a switch scheme like the Rockets had been using the last several years.  It's completely dishonest to just say ""yeah they're both switchable"".  There is an enormous difference.  Again to reiterate, it is not my contention to proclaim a ""winner"".  I don't even see the usefulness of that.  I am just refuting the ridiculous claim that it's ""not close""."
Brook Lopez
I’ll give you Brook Lopez
"Not sure if you realized but basketball is a team sport. I wonder how many games the bucks would have won in 2019 if Middleton missed 24 games like CP3, Brook Lopez missed 14 games like Capela, Eric Bledsoe missed 14 games like Eric Gordon and a myriad of other injuries to their role players."
"Reminds me of when Brook Lopez was in trade talks all the time, it’s a solid idea but in reality the trade packages don’t make sense. Contending teams don’t have anything the Magic want."
That point as a fan was tough. Devin Harris regressed. Courtney Lee was nothing special. Brook Lopez was young. Opposing teams would dunk on the franchise. Erik Spoelstra called the team nameless and faceless (you rarely see a coach talk about a team like that). LeBron hinted that the franchise should be contracted. It was tough
"I feel like it had more potential than we ended up getting  Like if rose and gordon didn't get their careers altered from injuries and players like Beasley,Mayo and Bayless lived up to their potential it would've been one of the best easily  But rn it's just Russ rn carrying that class and the other guys are just really good role players pretty much but some had their time to shine like (Rose, Love, Brook Lopez, DeAndre Jordan,etc)  I'd take classes like 2009,2011 and 2012 overall as classes tbh"
"Idk if we’re going off their career in general or just their time with the Nets, but here’s a rough list  Jason Kidd/Kyrie Irving/Deron Williams  James Harden/Joe Johnson/Vince Carter  Kevin Durant/Dr. J/Paul Pierce  Kevin Garnett/Derrick Coleman/Kenyon Martin  Brook Lopez  If it’s just about their time with the Nets, then you can go ahead and replace Pierce with Richard Jefferson and Deron with Drazen Petrovic. I’m sure I may be forgetting some people.   Honorable mention based on career: Sam Bowie, Buck Williams"
"Jrue, Teague, Bogdan Bogdanovic, and Brook Lopez in that exact order 🤡🤡🤡  just say you dont watch basketball"
"&gt; Christian Wood  my bad, I didn't know he was playing center this year  &gt; Porzingis  Plays zero defense (most important thing for a center!), offence consists purely of chucking bad shots, always hurt. Maybe he'll stay healthy and return to all-star form the more time passes since his injury, but I'm taking Ayton over him this year.  &gt; Sabonis  he's a power forward  &gt; Turner  not gonna lie, I haven't watched enough Pacers games to have an opinion  &gt; Capela  ok, sure  &gt; Ibaka  Hell no, and I say this as someone who owns an Ibaka jersey. He has become quite overrated.  &gt; Poetl  Andris Biedrins 2.0  &gt; Nerlens Noel  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1Ui-R1NGow  &gt; Brook Lopez  Hmm. Ayton is a much more switchable defender. Brook is kinda slow. Although Brook's ability to space the floor makes him better offensively. It's up in the air between these two imo."
"Christian Wood, Porzingis, Sabonis, Turner,  Capella, Ibaka(maybe), Poetl(maybe), Nerlens Noel(maybe), Brook Lopez(maybe)  So at best he's the 12th best center.  At worst he's the 16th."
"I saw Brook Lopez in Las Vegas a few years ago, he is skinnier in real life"
"&gt;They are all good defensively, and still dont have an all defense 2nd teamer.  Last year, Brook Lopez was the second-team All-defense center.  I don't see any reason why Nerlens Noel should not replace him this year.  &gt;They gonna give the hawks hell in the first round.  I expect so."
Hunh? Jrue and Brook Lopez aren’t getting any better.
"yup. i wasn’t actually trying to discredit steph, just making that point. steph is actually a very underrated rebounder for a guard  rebounding comes in so many different ways. you have stronger guys who box out (brook lopez, steven adams, etc.), guys with great vertical and hustle who get up and get it like westbrook, and guys with great IQ and positioning such as curry.   Russ is a combination of the last two, yet people use raw contested rebound % to dismiss all of this all-around contributions and label him a “stat-padder”. which is dumb, curry isn’t a stat padder because of his low contested rebound %"
"1: Brook Lopez  I obviously hope Harden, Kyrie, and Durant should end up there as well but it's hard to include them already."
Lamelo is a more athletic Luka. Luka is a shorter Jokic. Jokic is a Brook Lopez with passing. Brook Lopez is a Robin Lopez that's not crazy. Robin Lopez is Damian Jones with a hook shot. So basically Lamelo is Damian Jones with some non essential addons
"Randle left in free agency, don’t know why they just let him walk for no reason  Ingram was part of the AD trade  Russell and Mozgov were traded to the Nets for brook lopez and a pick  Clarkson and nance were traded to the cavs to clear up cap for the summer   All these moves were to clear up space to land LBJ"
Dude it’s fucking insane how much LeBron leads just the 2nd person in the race by.  Also Brook Lopez being top 20 is cool.
"The Nets are in a similar situation technically, only 1 of their stars was aquired through FA. KD was acquired thanks to Nets drafted Brook Lopez and Harden for Levert and Allen.  Technically the Lakers helped creating their biggest threat."
i have found out over the years i am a bigger fan of brook lopez than i am the nets.
Lou Will on Brook Lopez is not a great match up in the paint lol
"Keep Lonzo, Ingram, and Hart then trade for a 3 and D sg (Gary Harris?) and a rim protecting big that can shoot (maybe Brook Lopez?)"
Dwight actually knows how to box out which in this era centers don't really do much of. [Check out his NBA fundamentals video on rebounding.](https://youtu.be/q_ozw1PTgC8)  I'd say Brook Lopez also boxes out well but uses it for his teammates instead.
"Lmao none taken, its normal for people wanting to see the reigning champs fall. If we don't win it all this year (which I honestly think we won't), I want the Bucks to win it so that Giannis can put all that playoff no show talk to rest. Plus, I like your squad, especially Brook Lopez whom I'm still mad the Lakers let walk in 2018."
"I got either the Nets or Clippers winning it. Two of the best offenses in the league with tons of depth. They have so much firepower. I would love to see the Bucks win it all though, it'd be cool to see Giannis, Middleton, Jrue, Brook Lopez (I'm still fucking mad that the Lakers let him walk in 2018), and PJ Tucker get their 1st ring together."
"I mean I literally explains above.  Theres a baseline level of rebounding competence expected for 7 footers.  But as long as you meet that level no one cares .  If Joel embiid grabbed 14 boards per game vs 11 per game or whatever , no one cares, but with Westbrook people love to jerk off about his rebounding numbers .    Anyways, my point is for much of Brook lopez career, hes been below that baseline level of competence.   With the Nets he wasn't grabbing enough boards because he was too soft, its that simple"
"No one cares about how many rebounds bigs get. Thats why.  Unless you're like brook lopez or JJJ who are shitty rebounders , or Drummond where thats like the only thing hes good at"
That's nothing. Brook Lopez is also scared of rebounds.
Brook “Locked Out” Lopez
"You can't go from literal non shooter to even below average like Green in 4 seasons.   It takes absolutely tons of work, especially when starting from a base like Simmons. How long did it take Brook Lopez or Blake Griffin to become a decent 3 point shooters? And those guys started at least with an OK baseline level. It took Michael Jordan years to become the jump shooter he was, and he's freaking Michael Jordan.   Keep in mind too, the amount of time spent on working on shooting is time away from other aspects of his game. Fitness, strength, better halfcourt playmaking, defensive improvements, finishing at the basket, handling the ball. Is it worth taking time away from that when he's looking at maybe being a 33% shooter on 3 or 4 attempts at best?"
Not Brook Lopez!
"Hum... If I was 20 years old, a rookie, and dunked on such a respectable, established player such as Brook Lopez, I'd be pretty fucking hype lol"
Hahaha I love Brook Lopez. Perfect retort to the tough guy dunking and celebrating when down 11.
"I did the same thing when I heard he was that stat too lol, I feel we all have completely forgotten about brook lopez scoring 20+ ppg for a decade on the nets"

I like Brook Lopez because he looks a bit like Ryan Stiles.
"I love Brook Lopez, him and his brother are a hoot"
Now they're saying it was Brook Lopez.
[Brook Lopez is just out there having fun this season](https://streamable.com/o3nngk)
You can always tell a OG Nets fan from a bandwagon by how they talk about Brook Lopez.
"lmao love Brook Lopez man, funniest guy in the league (along with Robin Lopez ofcourse)"
"Jrue's passes right now are basically a 'Eh, you'll do'. None of our guys, except maybe Donte and some of the bench, seem to give a shit and I'm totally fine with it.  Also I think it's a good game for showing why Brook Lopez is still a great defender. Houston Rockets don't care about trying the rim while he's there, and sure enough, +17 in the 11 minutes he's been on."
"It does sometimes if you factor replacement. Like a center in a team can be better than the PG but be less important if you have a good bench center but no other player can handle the ball.  When the gap is as significant as this one it's pointless, though. You can have Curry, Harden and CP3 on the same team and they'd still be over Brook Lopez in a team with no other player over 6'10"
" &gt;	even though he’s a big, strong, mobile guy, he’s not a rim protector on the level of someone like Myles Turner, Clint Capela, or Brook Lopez.  Oh? Then how do you explain [this beautiful example of rim protection](https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/n6pfa3/highlight_andre_drummond_beautiful_display_of/)? I mean how do you score on this man"
"Andre Drummond is probably the most disappointing big in the league.   His size, mobility, and ability to leverage that size and strength should make him a good traditional center and he just isn't.   He's awful with the ball in his hands (no ball skills and bad touch around the rim), his shot selection is bad (steady diet of inefficient back-to-the-basket post-ups), and even though he's a big, strong, mobile guy, he's not a rim protector on the level of someone like Myles Turner, Clint Capela, or Brook Lopez."
"He’s still getting more contested boards a game than a player like Deandre Jordan, Myles Turner, Kawhi Leonard, Biyombo, Brook or Robin Lopez, and more even though his contested rebound % is around 25%. He gets more contested rebounds per game and at a higher percentage than Lebron and he is also within 0.2 contested rebounds or less of Anthony Davis, Julius Randle, etc. Really no matter how you slice it he’s a pretty incredible rebounder. Guards can’t do what he does and its not something that should be simply chalked up to “they want to speed up the pace.” That’s true, but you need a special player to be able to get the rebound with that degree of regularity in the first place."
Brook Lopez
"James Jones and Monty Williams   It's alright for you guys though, you got Jrue Hollidayand Kris Middleton and Brook Lopez.  I feel like I'm missing somebody"
On paper they’re good but I think it’ll come down to defensive schemes. I can see brook lopez getting abused in drop coverages with all the nets shooters.
&gt;Robin Lopez and Alex Len are not better rebounding centers.  No they are not but they were better against Brook Lopez tonight.  &gt;If we don't play Gafford in those last seven minutes we don't even have a chance to win the game.  You were lucky because Brook had his 5th foul and was benched. Otherwise he would've dominated Gafford.
Lopez had phenomenal position against a much smaller defender. Westbrook was blatantly hanging all over Brook to disrupt that. Not sure how they didn't call THAT one a foul with all the other fouls called tonight.  Idk if this was the first option on the play or just a smart read by the inbounder. Brook had an easy dunk without the foul and should have easily had two FTs off of this
"I just think the game they played in their era didnt require them to shoot 3s. For example, Brook Lopez and Blake Griffin added 3s to their game. What makes us think Duncan and Garnett wouldn’t have done the same and be successful at it if the game required them to shoot 3s? They are both all time greats."
He's a bad coach but his 3 center rotation is one of the good things he does. According to match-ups he changes their minutes. This way their center can stay fresh at the clunch time. And about Gafford he got outmuscled by Brook Lopez all game long so good thing he didn't play much. After all he gave up the game clinching rebound to Lopez so maybe Wizards shouldn't have close out with him.
Brook Lopez is so washed lmao
"2017 Brook Lopez that averaged 20 and 5, definitely not the absolute worst but an awful first option"
"Ehhh idk about that. He's got a track record now, great regular seasons, and not much playoff success. We have lost games cuz he didn't pull brook lopez out soon enough in the 4th when other teams go small."
The fact you put our current big 3 which weve seen for like half a season best and left off Richard Jefferson and Brook Lopez makes me question your knowledge of the nets.
"This is part of the reason I think the nets lose in the playoffs.  That had kd and green trying to box out brook Lopez down the stretch and they have zero way of stopping random role players from going crazy. They just can’t defend, rebound, or protect the rim. You can’t let guys like donte dominate you on the glass and expect to win a playoff series"
\*Brook Lopez
That’s nets all time leading scorer Brook Lopez
"Love Brook Lopez, but if he showed half a pulse on offense this Bucks team would be unbeatable"
Brook Lopez is one of the few guys slower than him starting at C so he can actually keep up I guess. Doesn’t make DJ good but it’s something
Brook Lopez
"Hmm. Not Jokic, Not Embiid, Not Gobert, recently not AD, not deandre, or Brook Lopez, not Vucevic...I don't watch ayton, randle, or capela enough.   Maybe jae crowder"
Brook Lopez tbh (though it wasn't his choice to leave)
"This season wasn't that bad, it was just mostly lateral. Pelinka would be known as a shit GM if he wasn't in LA though.   He let go of Brook Lopez who was willing to take a discount to stay in LA, let go of Randle who's now an all-star. Bought high on Danny Green and Dennis Schroeder after they had career years. Sold low on Danny after a slightly below average year. Didn't re-sign Dwight who was their most reliable center. His moves all seem a little impulsive.   They've drafted well but let a bunch of players go getting nothing significant back: Clarkson, Randle and D'Lo would've been huge on this roster."
"Bucks  + small market  + they drafted their superstar  + went all in to get Giannis help (Jrue)  + shrewd signings and trades like Brook Lopez, Middleton, Portis, Forbes, Bud"
"Can’t guard 3 people and even with good defense they will still hit shots. Worst case scenario, put brook lopez or someone in a switch to get him away from kyrie or harden. 5 games"
"&gt; Now the other shots he took before that were terrible  Yeah. He looked off today.   Also DeAndre Jordan man... At least the Bucks have Brook Lopez so he isn't as much of a liability, but having to play him really sucks. Blake's more effective in his minutes. Too bad he's old and only has 6 fouls to give lol."
Brook Lopez had more blocks (5) than the whole Nets team (1).
Brook Lopez needs to go the bench.  He is literally screwing his team on both sides of the ball
Brook Lopez is a meme.
June 3rd: it’s game 4 the bucks are down 20 and Bud is still switching Brook Lopez onto Kevin Durant in high pick and rolls so at least he can prove “he’s willing to adapt his scheme”
Brook “2.7 RPG” Lopez
Brook Lopez is not having a good time
"Looks like I put a ton of work into this but I copied and pasted something. I guess he was no lock because the Cavs were struggling, but statistically he was having a better season than other reserve big men (averaged 14-14-3.5 back when those were really good numbers and was known as a good defender)  [https://www.fearthesword.com/2012/12/6/3732814/anderson-varejao-all-star](https://www.fearthesword.com/2012/12/6/3732814/anderson-varejao-all-star) (Cavs source)  Marc Stein ESPN (paragraph below) [http://www.espn.com/nba/dailydime/\_/page/dime-130118-19/nba-2013-all-star-reserve-picks](http://www.espn.com/nba/dailydime/_/page/dime-130118-19/nba-2013-all-star-reserve-picks)  The Olympian (Tyson Chandler) has long been considered one of the most impactful defenders in the game, which is key for the Knicks given their increasing struggles at that end, but he's also averaging an uberefficient 12.4 points and 11.0 rebounds on 67 percent shooting from the floor in addition to his role as New York's emotional compass.  And Noah isn't far off that standard, averaging 12.4 points, 10.7 rebounds, 4.1 assists and 2.0 blocks to A) thrust himself into the heart of the defensive player of the year race and, more importantly, B) relentlessly and hyperactively lead the Bulls through life without Rose along with coach Tom Thibodeau.  It only figures, furthermore, that there are several more centers to consider in this category now that, according to the ballot, we're supposed to be de-emphasizing positions like we're all Erik Spoelstra. Brooklyn's [Brook Lopez](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3448/brook-lopez), Atlanta's [Al Horford](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3213/al-horford) and Miami's [Chris Bosh](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1977/chris-bosh) \-- who, yes, counts as a center on the smallish Heat no matter how Spoelstra is labeling him these days -- all have a strong case, **as Varejao would have if he hadn't gotten hurt.**"
"A 3&amp;D player IMO is a player who plays above average defense or is considered an above average defender (ideally someone who can guard the opposing team's 1st or 2nd best player), isn't really creating a lot of shots for themselves or others with the ball in their hands, and their primary role on offense is limited to taking and making threes. So guys like Danny Green, Robert Covington, Pat Beverley, Dorian Finney-Smith, Mikal Bridges, PJ Tucker, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, and OG Annuoby would be what I'd consider 3&amp;D players.  Some of the guys you listed are good three point shooters and defenders, but they create too much offense for themselves and/or others to be strictly seen as 3&amp;D players."
"Underrating Lowry, underrating Lowry, just no lmao. Brook Lopez has been the bane of the bucks more than their savior, Marc was huge for the raptors defense  Feel like it’s a completely scoring based analysis to say ghat"
Brook Lopez
"That was fine, the thing with him trying to coup d'état billy king and failing, then trying to force a bad trade of Brook Lopez to his new team was the bad part"
"Brook Lopez. Joakin Noah, Pau Gasol in the Bulls? Al Horford?"
He made Brook Lopez look like a 86 years old stiff guy last night.
"It’s team rebounding that matters. Individual rebounding is a massively overrated stat (unless it’s offensive rebounds). If you watch any game, there are a ton of rebounds players get which even if they didn’t get it, their teammate would and it is the same net benefit towards a team in helping them win  (this is the Westbrook special and how he manages to get so many rebounds but the rebounds have minimal to no team impact). It’s also the same reason someone like Brook Lopez doesn’t get any rebounds but his team always gets a ton of rebounds (since he does all the boxing out), so it inflates like Giannis’s individual rebounds (and all PF that played with Lopez in the past)."
It works with Brook Lopez and Giannis
It's actually gross when we close a game with Brook Lopez. The game moves too fast for him.
He drilled 3 straight 3s on Brook Lopez. Crazy game.
Yep. Both the Lopez are smart defenders but it seems this year especially their bodies are finally slowing down. Hope they feel more rejuvenated after this season. Brook and Robin must be sore from the Bubble and now this jam packed season. Tough on the 7 footers
"Defensive advanced stats aren't great as everyone here has already mentioned, but I think there are much better options than RPM.  Just out of curiosity, here are the 20 players with the highest **538 Defensive RAPTOR rating** (min. 1,000 minutes):  1. Rudy Gobert (**massive** lead for 1st) 2. Clint Capela 3. Matisse Thybulle 4. Jakob Poeltl 5. Joel Embiid 6. Myles Turner 7. Mike Conley 8. Derrick White 9. Alex Caruso 10. Rudy Gay 11. Nicolas Batum 12. Luguentz Dort 13. Andre Drummond 14. Jae Crowder 15. Larry Nance Jr. 16. Jimmy Butler 17. Isaiah Stewart 18. Khem Birch 19. Raul Neto 20. Nerlens Noel  A few oddities (Gay, Drummond, Neto) but overall not that bad.  -  ---  -  And then here are the 20 players with the highest **BBall Index D-LEBRON** (min. 1,000 minutes):   1. Rudy Gobert 2. Myles Turner 3. Clint Capela 4. Robert Covington 5. Nerlens Noel 6. Matisse Thybulle 7. Jakob Poeltl 8. Alex Caruso 9. Larry Nance Jr. 10. Giannis Antetokounmpo 11. Brook Lopez 12. Draymond Green 13. Joel Embiid 14. Ben Simmons 15. Tobias Harris 16. Jae Crowder 17. Andre Drummond 18. Kent Bazemore 19. Nicolas Batum 20. Jimmy Butler  Actually a very solid list IMO, Drummond is the only guy there where I'm like *eehhhhh.....*"
"What’s your definition of a role player? If it’s just a non-All Star without high usage (so not like a CJ McCollum), players like Mikal Bridges as you mentioned, and others like Joe Ingles, Serge Ibaka, Joe Harris, and Brook Lopez (who’s just a role player now) are all solid. Basically these guys would help any team but don’t require super high usage."
"I'm not debating with you on that. I'm sure we disagree but I'm not going to have that debate, because that has nothing to do with what you said. You said he's ""actively not trying to get better."" Which is dumb. Every NBA player tries to get better even dudes that are on the tail end of their careers. KD even said he's focused on trying to get better.   Him not showing tangible improvement, in your eyes, does not mean he isn't working to get better. Some things come quicker to some than others. Sometimes we don't see progress on the court until that player has worked on that skill for years. You think Brook Lopez just came into a season one day and decided to be a 3pt shooter? No he worked on it for years before he tried it with any regularity in a real game. These improvements don't come out of nowhere."
"Brook Lopez needs to be on the court in a series against Philly, which takes away their most dangerous lineup with PJ/Giannis at the 5. I think I would lean towards a healthy Philly but it’s close."
"Yeah, I did the math and he was hitting .412 before this streak. Better comparison after a little research on my part would be [Brook Lopez](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/lopezbr01.html) during the 2016 off-season when his three-ball went from non-existent to 5.2 shots per game at like 35%."
"First of all Deng and Mozgov were results of the front offices own incompetence. Secondly, they were bad players who you wouldn't want anyway and would look to get rid of. Yes they gave up dlo to get rid of mozgov but thats it. They had 3 top young players and signed a good center in brook lopez and still managed to sign the best player in the game. And if you go that route the warriors literally had to dump bogut for KD and lost majority of their bench."
"He gets stubborn and depends on his systems rather than specific plays or even players. For example, against the Raptors in 2019 (or even tonight against the Hornets), Brook Lopez wasn’t being used properly. He is a very one-dimensional player defensively now. He protects the rim, but if you put a shooter on him and then involve him in screen action, his man will usually get an open look for a three. But, on offense, he can still post up and do work down low. Brook was often being guarded by PJ Washington tonight, and consistently had Lowry or FVV switched on him in that 2019 series. He could still go get some high percentage shots with a classic post-up game there, but Bud prefers to just have him stand beyond the perimeter still. It’s situations like this, when Bud is stubborn about keeping the offense rolling in a specific system rather than playing Chess, that really get me sad."
"He’s set in his lineups a lot regardless of matchups, when he finally makes a change it’s usually too late. At least once a game he has a lineup out there that makes absolutely no sense.         Against the hawks it was the group to start the 4th in Teague, Donte, Connaughton, Middleton, and Portis which is a group with pretty much 0 defense, especially at those positions. Bud ran that lineup for about 3 and a half minutes which turned a 8 point lead into a 3 point one and pretty much set the tone for the entire terrible 4th quarter.       He does a lot of thing well but he’s just incredibly stubborn which is very frustrating when it comes to the things he doesn’t do well. Overall we are better this year and are definitely more talented but there’s still been times where rotations have cost us games and Bud is my biggest concern when it comes to finally getting over the postseason hurdle. I’m not sure he’ll have the guts to essentially eliminate guys like Forbes or Connaughton from the rotation in certain matchups that may call for it. Another one is Brook Lopez is going to be key against Philly and Embiid especially but could be virtually unplayable against Brooklyn but it’ll take bud at least 2 games to realize that."
"2012 called, it wants its Brook Lopez back."
Brook Lopez: Your Miles away from guarding me in the post
"Your argument originally had to do with the Lakers draft record, not how they managed those assets. You're changing your argument and I honestly have no idea why you're being so abrasive about it...we are just talking hoops after all. I would argue that a top 5-10 player like AD is almost invaluable, and he proved that in the playoffs last year. If that was the minimum that the Pelicans would take then that's what they had to pay. The Pelicans certainly didn't need to trade AD and they made it abundantly clear that they needed an offer they couldn't refuse to let him go. Kevin Love as good as he was is certainly not Anthony Davis, and Wiggins was considered by some to be the next superstar...they traded him before he played a day in the NBA. And the AD trade worked out pretty well for both sides, so ultimately what is more draft picks and pick swaps worth for a championship? I would say not much.  You're not even making the right arguments if you're trying to poke holes in Lakers front office moves, there's plenty you can bring up like not resigning Brook Lopez for peanuts, the aforementioned Zubac trade, the Luol Deng signing (who they are STILL paying, LOL), basically every free agent move in LeBron's first year (Lance Stephenson, Michael Beasley, etc.)."
"There could be truth to that, it really helped the baby Lakers in 2017-18 to have Brook Lopez out there to spread the floor. Ingram really improved in attacking the rim getting reps w/ the big man pulled out or the chance to practice kick outs to Brook."
"13 -14 Nets in 10 -11 gives you  KG, Deron, Pierce, Brook Lopez, AK47, Jason Terry and Joe Johnson (can't go much earlier than that cause Brook is way younger than the rest)"
"Maybe this is more because of how these guys were adapting to the already changing game, but Marc Gasol and Brook Lopez adding the 3 pointer to their games was a huge surprise that we have seen more bigs add after them."
"Y'all didn't smoke the daylights out of us in 2014. You beat us in Game 4 by 6 and needed 49 from LeBron to do so, and in Game 5 by 2 where we had possession for the last 10 seconds to potentially win the game. By no means am I saying you guys shouldn't have won that series but we definitely gave y'all some trouble, you didn't just step all over us. Don't even get me started about how Brook Lopez was out"
"So frustrating to see this kind of decision. Basket ball is such a nice sport but the NBA is detroying the game with their stupid rules and the lack of consistency from the ref... you have so many players who are flopping all the time, but not Brook Lopez... Offensive fouls are also a joke, depending who you are you don't get the same call..."
"I mean, yeah, KD can get his shot off versus pretty much anyone, but doubling him still bothers him significantly -- there's a reason why his playoff numbers on the Warriors (w/ all time spacing) were very good whereas his playoff numbers in OKC (w/ no spacing) were poor for what he put up in the regular season. Nets had some spacing (Jeff Green was scorching hot, you have to respect Harden/Joe Harris regardless of their shooting numbers) but you could still definitely try to rotate over.  As far as the shooting threat goes, most of the players you double are pretty big shooting threats, because they are very good players. You gotta stay disciplined in your rotations and prevent the pass back to Durant, sure, but it's better than letting him shoot over Tucker/Middleton or blow by Brook Lopez on the switch for the 10th time in a row.  Not taking anything from what KD did though -- man was possessed last night."
"Any other coach running that team and the bucks would cruise to the finals. For fucks sake, their *fourth* scoring option is *Brook Lopez*, who is still a bona-fide beast of a center. He can flat out score down low, and is a great rim defender on the other end. And that's THEIR FOURTH OPTION! It only goes up from him. And by up, I mean up to god damn two time MVP Giannis! The fact that Bud has wasted what should be an unstoppable team these past years is simply inexcusable. It disgusts me.  I guarantee any *actual* great coach is looking at that team absolutely fucking drooling at the potential they have. And it's all being wasted by Mike ""*This* will be the year my same shitty ass game plan that I never ever make adjustments to in the playoffs will finally work"" Budenholzer."
"I disagree with that line of thinking about your defense. In the playoffs, you are only as good as your weakest defensive link, and a competent team would be able to attack Trae and Lou on defense, just like how the Nets just murdered Brook Lopez and Connaughton with KD over and over again, or how the Jazz attack Reggie Jackson and Kennard every single time that they are in. The issue is that the Sixers have no one who can hunt those defensive vulnerabilities down the stretch. Best bet is Tobias Harris but he fucking sucked today."
"Nick Nurse gave the NBA an open patent on how to stop the Bucks' MVP in 2019, and Giannis still hasn't learned any effective counters to it.   Coach Bud running an ugly iso-fest ""offense"" that is Jim Boylen levels of bad and getting bailed out by almost pure talent + the Nets only having KD. His usage of Brook Lopez is criminal, man is a monster down low yet gets parked in the corner 3 spot. Multiple times Lopez had tiny forwards/guards switched onto him and no one could get him the ball down low. Whats the point of having Lopez out there then? Might as well run Giannis as a full-time 5  The defense doesn't make sense either, why tf are they just giving KD easy looks all game then start panicking late-game when KD is already in his groove. And that ridiculous drop coverage  by Lopez is exactly whats giving KD all those easy looks because no one is stepping up to meet KD."
"If a 280 pound man did that to me, I would be begging my insurance company for prosthetics by now. Embiid was so fucking reckless, if another 280 lb human like Brook Lopez did that to him, he would never participate in another NBA game knowing his injury history."
We have a center. Brook Lopez didn't do shit but coast and shoot behind the three point line. Fuck.
"You guys are getting ridiculous. Simmons with a team built around his skills would be a hugely beneficial player. If he played with a Brook Lopez and Chris Boucher as his big men that would open up so many more driving lanes to get to the rim, Tobias and Embiid clog the paint up just a bit too much for him to get to the hoop often.   Now if he's gonna shoot 30% from the line for the rest of his career I might be a better NBA player than him, that's just completely unacceptable and I don't think it'll remain that low long term."
Plus using the screens only should’ve made it easier for the Bucks to trap. I don’t care who gets left open I’m not letting KD be comfortable whether it’s using the screen to get down hill or just using it to create a mismatch.  Like instead of Brook Lopez playing drop coverage against Kevin fucking Durant he should’ve been up to help trap. Figure out the rotations and everything else later.
"Brook Lopez is so much bigger than any of the Nets, plus he's pretty good in the post. The poor utilization of him on offense is infuriating."
"I said this in a post game thread and people were acting like I was an idiot. If bud wins one this year it's not gonna be by virtue of his genius and you guys have a back to back MVP locked up for like 6 years, I personally wouldn't want to just call it there and I don't know what else bud has to do to show people he sucks in the playoffs. He lost 2 games to an eighth seeded nets team whose best players were Brook Lopez and Joe Johnson when he had a 60 win team with 3 all stars, he's obviously fine as a regular season coach but you guys deserve some real banners."
"Oh please. Mets have no size and he’s got giannis taking fadeaways and Brook Lopez, the largest human out there, camping out and jacking 3’s. Terrible game by the coach."
"Thanks to his shooting ability, entering the league at a favorable time,  and playing in offensive systems that give him the green light from 3, Karl Towns will likely retire the unanimous GOAT 3 point shooting *center*   He's already 2nd all time with 629 makes in only 408 games. #1 is Brook Lopez with 633 makes in 850 games, so KAT should easily surpass him-- and Lopez is 8 years older. After those two, there is a huge drop off and they are retired players. the next closest active player is likely Jokic who is in 7th place, with 439 makes in 453 games.  This is oddly specific but I'd say it qualifies as an answer to your question"
"How can you compare this to the clippers? The bucks just had the most pathetic performance I’ve seen from a team in years. From the top to bottom it was an absolute mess.   The coach doesn’t make any adjustments or have a gameplan, Giannis is running into 5 people over and over again, taking fadeaways in the post and not demanding the ball when Joe Harris is guarding him, Brook Lopez is shooting threes with Mike James on him and nobody was repeatedly attacking Harden on offense. Don’t even get me started on Giannis dropping a handoff pass and not guarding Durant."
The spacing on offense was so bad in the 4th and watching brook Lopez play drop coverage on the most lethal mid range shooter in the game was making my blood boil and I’m not even a bucks fan
My dream is somehow he gets sign and traded to bucks for Brook Lopez. Extremely unlikely unless we're playing 2k tho
"no shit prime Dwight's better. At least he can back down people in a mismatch, and his rim protection is god-tier.  but this bucks team is better perimeter defensive-wise with two all NBA defenders, Brook Lopez in rim protection, and off the bench, PJ Tucker and a hustle man in Portis. And more shooting with Forbes and Connaughton."
Vince Carter   KD  Brook Lopez   MarShon Brooks
"I agree, it's a very legitimate decision to ask Giannis to guard KD on certain possessions or stretches of the game; depending on score, time, lineups, fouls/penalty situation, etc.   This should've been something the Bucks tried out more earlier in the series, just to at least get an idea of what can, and won't work with Giannis on KD.  I believe part of the hesitation may have been the pretty good job they've done on KD the last 2 games; Durant being off from three forced him to drive inside a lot more where Lopez and the help defenders could load up a bit more.  But last night, KD was rocking so much from three that it becomes very difficult to double that far away (i think they still should've done it); but there's also a scenario where you send 2 and KD just shoots over the top anyways cuz he's KD.   Also with the way Green was shooting last night, having Brook out there was probably a liability for certain stretches, especially because he was barely being used at all on offense as  MIL went to iso after iso down the stretch.   Coach Bud didn't coach a great game down the stretch, that part's pretty obvious. But the players themselves didn't help matters either."
How did bud allow the nets to put brook lopez as the drop guy in pick n roll defense for the entire 4th quarter. I think the nets scored 87 pts off that play alone in the 4th
He had Brook Lopez iso’d on the wing at one point and made a couple crossovers and shot a step back without getting any actual separation then bricked it. I think he drove maybe 3 or 4 times in the 45 minutes he played
Fuck it. Let Brook Lopez bring it up the floor. So random lul
"He was barely playing any defense, how are the refs going to call anything on Harden when even Brook Lopez can probably blow by him at this point?  Jrue is soft.  Dude airballed an elbow jumper against Harden and proceeds to talk about how.  I don't want to hear anything about fouls."
"Here's the thing, if you put Giannis on KD, and KD calls for a screen, who switches onto KD at that point? Brook Lopez? PJ Tucker? Who's covering the rim if he dribbles past the center? Who has the size to help on defense at the rim once he gets past Lopez/Giannis?"
"You think Riley, Kerr, or Pop wouldn't take Giannis out and tell him loudly to stop shooting 3s?  You think they'd just let the group ISO for 8 straight minutes?  You think he'd leave Brook Lopez in for 8 straight possessions of identical plays of being cooked in the PnR?  We had  17 point lead and gave up 5 consecutive open 3s with nobody within 5 feet.  Up 15+ the defensive plan should be protect the rim and dont sink off shooters. Period.  If KD gets to his spots midrange so be it.  But tis much harder to shoot yourself back into a game on midrange shots."
"Yeah the two egregiously bad decisions he's made so far are  1. Taking back Eric Bledsoe instead of George Hill in the Jrue Holiday trade. Zion plays almost the same style of ball that Giannis does, but Griffin didn't get the message that the Bucks were literally trying to dump Bledsoe because of how egregiously bad he was in the playoffs. I'm pretty convinced that they could've easily had HILL considering he was just redirected to OKC anyways. Hill's contract was much more manageable and he was a much better fit alongside Pelicans' core (spacing + decent defense) 2. Bringing in Steven Adams instead of Myles Turner. Myles Turner, while he is not as good at rebounding/boxing out, is a better rim protector and can actually space the floor on offense for Zion. One of the reasons the Bucks exploded was because they brought in Brook Lopez to clear out the floor for Giannis. Myles Turner was VERY AVAILABLE. The Celtics were exploring a market to redirect him and found that few teams valued him. The Pelicans coulda had him last offseason for super cheap  The team David Griffin is building around Zion, in spite of the fact that they have a shit ton of assets, is so bad that I'd be worried that Zion would take the qualifying offer just to gtfo  Pelicans need to fire him if they don't want Lebron 2.0 on their hands"
From the man who made Brook Lopez a 7'6 Craig Hodges
"Yes, pnr with jrue/giannis, and brook on the opposite low post from the roll side, and it absolutely destroyed miami. Any help comes to the roll and lopez had easy buckets. It's actually insane they dont run this here"
I don’t think you need a third center with AD playing as a center too also this may be crazy but for the last guy I may go Duncan Robinson over brook lopez just because he can drain 3s at a crazy rate
Lmao the dude just listed 4 sure fire HOFers and this mfer brings up Jrue and Brook Lopez cmon dawg
"Durant was facing the DPOY, a great defender in Middleton, supposedly the best guard defender in Jrue Holiday and a solid paint protector Brook Lopez"
"Well when he ran like 6-7 consecutive PnRs targetting Brook Lopez I probably would have stopped playing Brook Lopez.   Either slide Giannis up to the 5 or bring PJ Tucker back or play Bobby Portis or something.   Hell, even some sort of zone scheme where Lopez hangs back and a wing defender comes in to help with the PnR could have maybe worked.  **tl;dr** something &gt; nothing."
"Not a bucks fan. I blame giannis the coach and brook lopez, all three fail to take advantage of mismatches. Wtf is giannis doing in the off-season ???"
Ask Brook Lopez if Bud wants them inside. It's clearly #2.
"It still had to be almost entirely the contract dump. We had to give something of value, and the FO was planning on drafting Lonzo who was also a point guard, so DLo was a perfect asset to use to dump the mozgov contact and get a nice year out of Brook Lopez and the Kuzms pick too."
"Frankly, I think the problem is less that Giannis isn't guarding KD and more that they keep putting Brook Lopez out there to get cooked by everyone on the Nets. Giannis isn't actually quick enough to defend KD very well, which would be *fine* if Bud would actually consider playing him as a small-ball 5 against teams that won't punish him for it. Nobody on that team is actually equipped to stop KD one-on-one."
Once we took the lead it was really only brook Lopez who was keeping them still in
There were multiple possessions of fucking Mike James and Bruce Brown covering Brook Lopez at the 3 point line. Why the hell weren't the Bucks eating them up on the inside? I would be infuriated and Coach Bud needs to be launched to the moon.
"That's a bad excuse.  Giannis' bigger teammate, brook Lopez, has touch."
"Look some people are saying giannis couldn’t have guarded KD and that he’s better as a help defender.  Fair point! But,  1. He was on joe harris, bruce brown a lot or the time, is he gonna sag to help? No.   2. When he did sag off griffin, griff hit his shots.  3. Brook lopez on drop coverage was not the better option.  4. Its not like teams havent bothered KD before. They did it by guarding him with different players, doubling him, none of which happened today.  5. Sure you can’t expect Giannis to guard him all game but a couple of possessions here and there would have been good to try in the middle of all the eviscerating Durant was doing."
"-Horrible offensive schemes  -Horrible defensive schemes  -Heavy and unnecessary isos with Giannis and Jrue  -Brook Lopez being a drop coverage…still  -Budenholzer refusing to make in game adjustments  And mostly importantly, KD literally playing like the best player in the world, which after this game, I think he is."
"That’s not true. Look, I’ve been watching Harden for years and he is very crafty, but he doesn’t do this type of shit unless there’s legitimate contact. Look at the link I sent. Lopez fucked up here by trying to elbow Harden in the neck (which, by the way, Brook does A LOT when boxing out), and Harden took advantage by hooking his arm to maintain that contact and show the refs. He didn’t grab Lopez’ arm and put it on his neck"
Brook Lopez and Jrue Holiday are both over 30. This core isn’t getting any better.
"&gt;Despite the fact that Harden initiated contact, there was still contact by Brook here  It's funny because Lopez literally does not touch him.  Harden uses *both arms to swing on Lopez and got a call*.  Should be a max fine for that. It's disgusting."
It’s his fault should have ran offense through brook lopez.  Bk too smalll
"How do you chalk this up? Is it the mental gymnastics from these Bucks players or coaching problem?   Giannis late 3, stupid fadeaway, having the ball in his hands less than a min left so he can shoot FTs.   On top of Khris Middleton trying to shoot over a locked-in Kevin Durant. People only see KD's offensive prowess but he was locked in on defense as well.   No ball movement which was their bread and butter.   Brook Lopez and not even playing Bobby Portis which would give them more mobility over Uncle Jeff."
Brook Lopez is way too good to be off the floor
"naw c'mon don't be salty, refs weren't bad enough to swing the game tonight. bucks didn't make the right adjustments when the nets were coming back and were panicking/playing hero-ball instead of running offense.   also could've put giannis on durant, also could've gone small ball instead of letting brook lopez get cooked. i was rooting for the bucks too"
As if bucks don’t set illegal screens lol combined with uncalled defensive 3 seconds allowing brook lopez to set up a tent in the paint without guarding anyone
"Some people will tell you it’s Buds fault, but Bud actually isn’t a horrible coach.   Giannis is one of the best help defenders ever. He has all-world defensive timing and he covers a lot of distance quickly.   However him staying on of KD not only puts a gaping hole in the defense (any play where Durant isn’t touching the ball has Giannis somewhere in the corner). And instead you’re left with PJ Tucker and Brook Lopez trying to roam and help off of their man.   And also he can’t guard KD. The best defenders for him are usually shorter, bulky guys who can disrupt his dribble. Every athletic tall dude that thinks he can stay infront just gets cooked."
since I live in Portland I vote that the Bucks trade Giannis &amp; Brook Lopez for Nurkic &amp; CJ
Brook Lopez playing drop coverage in the pnr probably cost the Bucks the game. Tucker would get screened off Durant and then Lopez couldn't close out to contest in time. By the time the Bucks put Middleton on KD their lead had already evaporated.  I agree though KD was incredible and he deserves all the praise coming to him for putting his team on his back.
"I don’t think Brook Lopez could help effectively trap KD. Pat, maybe. They were sort of doing it with Middleton on KD anyways"
"I mean there are a lot of larger philosophical issues, but Bud is the biggest culprit. Once it was clear Harden was at about 50%, the Bucks should have been getting the ball out of KD's hands in the 4th with traps, hard doubles, anything. Make Harden or Shamet or aging Blake make plays. You can't let Durant just own every possession, particularly if you're taking Tucker off him and giving him the chance to attack Brook Lopez possession over possession. That wasn't even a hard 49, he was getting almost every shot look he could want most of the second half.  Brooklyn's second best player tonight was Jeff Green. You have to make everyone else beat you."
"I still can’t believe they didn’t go small, Brook Lopez dropping back and letting KD take jumper after jumper was painful"
"The fact we left Brook Lopez in to get absolutely torched all 2nd half and not switch to Portis is beyond me.  I honestly don’t think Bud should be allowed on the flight back.   Jrue looking like Bledsoe, Giannis looking like he didn’t want to be involved on defense at all."
"""What a tough win, man. They've got great players there. Middleton, Jrue, and Brook Lopez.""  - James Harden after playing hobbled for 46 minutes"
"So you don’t think letting Brook Lopez get cooked in the pick and roll then having him guard Jeff green wasn’t completely his fault? How is it not the coaches fault for leaving a 5 out on offense that can’t space the floor or run a play?  Lebron overruled Blatt by getting him fired, Giannis should do the same"
"Bucks don't really have a playmaker, and Bud didn't call any plays down the stretch, or give any direction on how the team should go. They got Brook Lopez and Giannis, and Brooklyn got KD and fucking Jeff Green, yet they chose to put the ball in Jrue or Middleton's hands. Just horrible coaching"
Someone please explain why Brook Lopez plays? KD had about 20 on his drop coverages and he provides nothing but stand in the corner
Giannis at the 5 is infinitely more mobile than Brook Lopez who moves like he's in quicksand
Down the stretch I would sit Brook Lopez and let Giannis play as the 5. Offensively attack Harden far more and would double off of him (he couldn't hit a shot to save him). This was an all-time bad coaching job.
"This may have been one of the most exciting games I've  ever been able to watch live. That being said I am honestly incredibly upset about the foul called on brook lopez against harden. I don't see how that call stands after review. I admit I'm not an nba official so I'm most likely wrong, but just knowing how legendary this game could've been had it gone further genuinely makes me angry that it was wasted on such a imo bad call. Those points changed the outcome of this game, even though it wasn't a two point win.  Congrats to the nets for the win though! Glad I got to witness this game from KD. Honestly felt like a special performance from him tonight."
Leaving Brook Lopez in the 4th was a huge mistake. For one.
"First off. Did we deserve to win? Hell no. Fire Bud.       Now. NBA, from the point where Harden grabs Lopez' arm and starts pulling, explain how Brook commited a foul.       I'm done watching this garbage product (the reffing and my team)."
Brook Lopez. Known interior player.
"Harden hooked brook lopez, knocked himself down to the ground, and was rewarded with two huge FTs at the end of a massive game.  This is the NBA.  Fuck James Harden.  Biggest pussy in the league"
That 3 might just do it. And look Brook Lopez in the paint for a dunk
"Brook Lopez, extremely underrated hairline"
You have a 7 foot tall oaf in brook lopez standing on the 3 point line instead of posting up James harden
"Just so you all know, I love brook lopez"
Brook Lopez being on the floor in this situation is just a coaching failure.
What is the point of keeping Brook Lopez in rn. He serves no purpose if you’re not going to let him post up against James harden rn
This fraud still has Brook Lopez in the game lmao
Do you think Brook Lopez traded his post ability for the three point shooting?
Giannis really about to defer to brook lopez huh
Brook Lopez is being defended by an injured Harden and they never even considered going to him.
Their 2nd half play gives me very little reason to believe they'll pull away. KD's scoring look effortless and they're hardly doing anything to stop it meanwhile we still got Brook Lopez on the floor
"Coach Bud has got to be the shittiest coach in the league. He doesn’t call timeouts when he needs to stop the Nets momentum, he doesn’t utilize Brook Lopez in the post against Durant (not only can Brook score easily against Durant, but you also force him to work in the defensive end). Instead Brook camps out on the corner three with Durant, so Durant just gets to rest on D and expend all his energy on offense."
It cements Coach Bud as a moron for keeping Brook Lopez on him
They played Brook Lopez way too long…
Take brook lopez out. He’s getting embarassed
Brook Lopez just looks like an idiot. Sure he's a nice guy though.
I have a bold take  Brook Lopez cannot guard Kevin Durant
for the love of god take brook lopez out and start giannis at the 5
Why is Brook Lopez that far away from the rim for that Durant dunk?
Brook Lopez space-jammed Joe Harris talent this game it seems
"Brook Lopez, the Cuban curry"
I think this is the first time in a long time I’ve focused on watching Brook Lopez move up and down the court. He’s fluid af for someone as tall and wide as he is. He’s running well at 33.
Brook Lopez killing his old team is my favorite timeline
Brook Lopez outshooting Joe Harris. Just as everyone expected.
Joe Harris just a poor man’s Brook Lopez
brook lopez is a human catapult
"Brook ""Joe Harris"" Lopez."
Brook Lopez runs like an emu
Brook Lopez is a supermassive black hole
"Brook ""Joe Harris"" Lopez"
Brook Lopez runs like he doesn’t know how to run
That's why they hardly post up Brook Lopez
"What, you don't like watching Brook Lopez play as small as the guard covering him?"
"Brook Lopez is really gonna eliminate the Nets, we're living in strange times"
Give it to brook lopez lol
Brook Lopez
"\#11: trae, kyrie, klay, sabonis, brook lopez with Tim Hardaway Jr. as a 6th man"
"CJ averages more PPG than Khris so I’m not sure what your point is about offense. And you’re vastly overrating Khris’ defense, the dude plays on a team with two 1st team all-defense players and Brook Lopez. It covers mistakes.   You probably want Donte as your 6th man anyway, it’s a role he excels in"
"It's not that easy. You overestimate the value of a Future Non-Lottery Pick. It took 3 1st and 2 swaps for Jrue. We also already have Donte, who is younger, cheaper and a better fit to the Bucks.  Also you're underestimating Khris' defense. He could hold he's own on CP3, which CJ couldn't do. We also have Brook Lopez, so combing CJ's defense and Brook's Drop defense is a disaster.   Don't start the ""just adjust the players to fit around CJ"" because that's idiotic. We wouldn't change how 3 of our players play because we traded a great 2nd option to our best player for a crappier and worse defensive version of Khris."
"That's an entirely different argument there, but sure, we'll break this down.  Suns beat Lakers, AD missed games 5 and 6, half of game 4, CP3 ""plays"" injured. Then we swept the Murray-less Nuggets. After that, Clippers sans Kawhi (while winning 2 games without CP3). Currently against the Bucks who are healthy outside of Donte.  Bucks swept a Heat who were missing Oladipo (which I bring up because yeah, he wasn't a main piece to their team yet, but they made the trade and lost rotation pieces for it, so it does play a role), then were given the biggest break of the postseason with the Nets losing Kyrie and a (much more than Lebron) hobbled Harden, then beat the Hawks with an injured Trae (Giannis missed some time as well, similar to CP3 against the Clippers). Now, they're against a Suns team that is healthy besides Saric.  Nowhere in my argument did I say that Saric was a Giannis stopper, the reason we're losing, or compare him to Anthony Davis as you've claimed I have. In fact, if you look back at other comments I've made in this thread, you'll see I straight up said that Saric couldn't contend against the athleticism of the AD/Lebron duo. The reason why Saric is a bigger loss against the Bucks is because the Bucks aren't throwing a Lebron and AD level combo at us, instead it's Giannis and the much less threatening Brook Lopez, which Saric would be better against.  You've tried putting words in my mouth and claim that I have compared Saric's impact to AD's. That's a bold faced lie. If you're just going to make things up about what I've said, then this conversation is pointless."
"Who is the harder combination to defend? AD and Lebron, or Giannis and Brook Lopez. The answer is easily Lebron and AD. We throw Saric in there as another big body to stand against Lopez so that Ayton can focus more on Giannis rather than being the only physical presence in the paint, like he currently is. It isn't that hard to understand."
"I’ve liked David Griffin but everyone knew immediately handing Steven Adams that big extension was dumb. Cmon, you need a floor stretching rim protecter at center next to Zion, a la Brook Lopez or Daniel theis.   Part of me wishes we got to see the AD-Zion combo"
"Find me one instance where I said we didn't struggle against the Lakers size. The difference between that series and this is guarding the duo of Lebron and AD is a lot more difficult than guarding the duo of Giannis and Brook Lopez. On top of that, the Bucks have more capable guard defenders in Holiday and Tucker than the Lakers did, meaning that not being able to contend down low is even more difficult since we aren't able to play as freely from up top. Not having our secondary center takes away whatever option we had to match size.  But you're right, I should give up trying to talk any sense into you since you don't seem to be willing to listen to why losing a key rotational piece makes a series harder. I hope whatever team you cheer for doesn't lose their backup anything ever, otherwise you might find yourself in a difficult situation with zero sympathy."
Brook Lopez holding the ball and passing as the shot clock expired vs the Nets. Could have been disastrous for this run
"He made great adjustments in the last three games. The biggest criticism I had in the Finals is that they let Chris Paul walk to the three point line unchecked and let him dictate the flow of the half court offense with zero pressure. Once they decided to apply pressure before half court and the Suns had to start improvising is when the entire series changed. They are a relatively young and inexperienced team outside of CP3 so you have to force them to make decisions.   I also like how he realized Brook Lopez wasn't working and starting playing the PnR with Giannis and stepping away from 1-2 passes 3 ball they were doing games 1 and 2. Once they started feeding it to Giannis in the paint and forced them to either give up an easy 2 or foul opened up so much room for Jrue, Khris, and Pat to get easier shots.   Being able to look back and decide you were wrong with your approach and changing it is the sign of a great coach. A lot of people don't realize how stubborn coaches can be and how they blame the players over the scheme."

"Jeremy Lin credited his rise during Linsanity to Kenny (who was an assistant on the Knicks at the time).  DeMarre Carroll had his best seasons in the NBA under Kenny, both in Atlanta and Brooklyn. Brook Lopez started shooting 3's in Brooklyn in large part because of him. Dinwiddie, Harris, LeVert, and Allen all made huge strides under him   I think its safe to say he's at least decent at player development."
"Bullshit on Yao  AT WORST Yao would be 'Brook Lopez but better', which is certainly a dropoff from stardom but a far cry from being bad"
That’s the whole point. He can get played off the floor by small ball on defense. He’s an average rim protector with no mobility. He’s a better shooting weaker brook lopez with worse post moves who’s on a max contract.
"Um Lopez put up 30 against the hawks, by his own will and determination. He owned us that game. Don't do that to brook! Lol"
The more likely scenario is that SVG wanted Adams because he admired Milwaukee's defensive scheme and thought Adams could fit the Brook Lopez role.
"is more like he became brook lopez to luka giannis   whether that is on him, the team or both i dont know"
Lol Jae Crowded initiated more contact with Brook Lopez in the first quarter and got called for a jump ball.
New Jersey Nets Brook lopez
"I think it was a: Giannis/Lopez/Portis/Tucker/Middleton lineup they went to partly because Jrue was in foul trouble and Teague was just horrible.  Off the top of my head it worked pretty well, the suns had no answer for their size but I also remember Jrue coming back in for Brook not that long after, but yeah it was definitely an interesting lineup"
"Jrue Holiday, Donte DiVincenzo, Khris Middleton, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Brook Lopez.   Jeff Teague, Bryn Forbes, Pat Connaughton, PJ Tucker, Bobby Portis."
"In addition to making the playoffs and 50+ wins out West, Dirk made ASGs int he West going up against a ton of great bigs/forwards. Competition was so good that Dirk missed All Star Games while averaging: 22/9/2 ('01), 17/7/3 ('13), 18/7/2 ('16)  Aside from the first season, none of those seasons pop out as all time great seasons, but they were still solid numbers, in the West he didn't come close to the ASG, but in the East I'm sure he makes the ASG 2 or maybe even all 3 times with those numbers. Dirk was making all star games and all NBA teams while going up against prime Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett.   For reference the years he missed the ASG while putting up those numbers, Eastern conference bigs who got in were averaging:   * 2001: Dirk averaged 22/9/2    * Anthony Mason averaged 16/10/3    * Glenn Robinson averaged 22/7/3    * Lattrell Sprewell averaged 18/5/4    * Allan Houston averaged 19/4/2    * Antonio Davis averaged 14/10/1 * 2013: Dirk averaged 17/7/3    * Luol Deng averaged 17/6/3    * Brook Lopez averaged 19/7/2    * Kevin Garnett averaged 15/8/2    * Chris Bosh averaged 17/7/2 * 2016: Dirk averaged 18/7/2    * Paul Millsap averaged 17/9/3    * Al Horford averaged 15/7/3    * Pau Gasol averaged 17/11/4    * Andre Drummond averaged 15/14/1"
Funny how the narrative can switch so quick with winning. He did make a couple adjustments though. Brook Lopez has played way less and Giannis is playing the 5 a lot more.
Brook Lopez and PJ are not to be underestimated
Lmao yeah All Stars Brook Lopez and Jeff Teague leading us to the promise land
Milwaukee!!  Kareem/ Giannis /Oscar /Sidney Moncrief / Ray Allen.  Reserves//  Middleton/Michael Redd/ Brandon Jennings/Brook Lopez/ Monta Ellis/ Glen Robinson.
"I’m open to this but is it? In Milwaukee I can only think of Brook Lopez going there and I don’t think he had all that many options if he wanted to get paid as much-I don’t think he was a minimum signing. Even though Milwaukee has been winning for years and clearly was an excellent bet to at least get to the second round, minimum."
"Luka/PG/Harrison Barnes/Julius Randle/Brook Lopez   (I tried to make a semi-realistic team though it’s still a little star-heavy, this team could really punish small ball minus Lopez being a defensive liability when switched into fast guards)"
"Couldn’t agree more.  The constant complaining by Booker/CP3 and CP3’s cheap shot history versus the likable players on the Bucks.  I love PJ Tucker’s story and how hard he plays. Watching him keep making Durant work for everything  Durant got was great to see.  Brook Lopez seems like a good team guy who can be your #1 option or #4 and he doesn’t care either way. Liked to watch him at Stanford, with his brother, way back when.  I really enjoyed watching Holiday on the Pelicans and was surprised they let him go.  Middleton came out of nowhere for me. I’m a big college basketball fan and don’t remember him at all. Now he’s sometimes the best player on the court during the NBA finals.  Plus the fact that they didn’t go the super team route, and their superstar appears to be a humble and good guy, it’s nice to see their success.  As a Knicks fan since the late ‘70’s, it is nice to see a small market team be successful through good decision making.  Maybe Giannis will be a 15-20 year Buck ala Duncan, Nowitzki, &amp; Kobe with their respective teams."
"A lot of the less pleasant of our new bandwagon fans on the Nets subreddit will not let go of this bitter ""Giannis is dirty!"" narrative, insisting that he intentionally injured Kyrie in round 2.  Not most, but an upsettingly vocal and too large subset of our fans.  I don't really go to our sub much since it became a Brooklyn off season because I don't dig the negativity.  Plus, I'm fine with the Bucks cuz I want Brook Lopez to get a ring, and green is my fav color, and their green &amp; cream jersey is my favorite non Nets jersey in sports."
I mean he's not Brook Lopez or Joel Embiid. He's pretty strong but doesn't have that huge base that some centers do. Thats why I called him fairly skinny not incredibly skinny.
"I think Brook and Giannis take up space. You can’t have Giannis down there battling Ayton, so that alone is a good enough reason to have Lopez on the floor. There are things the Suns can do to affect the Bucks with Lopez out there, however. They got 48 minutes out of Portis and Lopez in the paint. Nothing to sneeze at. The Suns weren’t ready for that switch (39 minutes comparatively Game 4)."
"I thought Bud made an amazing adjustment to have KMidd be the ball handler in that extra large line up with Giannis at the 3, connington, brook lopez and PJ. Jrue got some great rest minutes during that stretch"
Remember when they let Brook Lopez go for nothing?
"Bro what are you talking about. I counted 12 pushoffs from Booker this game, none of which were called and CP3 wrapping Khris Middleton on certain plays on the perimeter. And yet, these were no calls. Brook Lopez or PJ Tucker, on the other hand, graze Book on the shoulder and it’s a foul. How much help do you need from the refs in addition to shooting 55% and nearly 70% from 3. Come on man."
wait is brook lopez in?
Brook Lopez number 2
"Props to brook lopez too he had his best game of the series tonight, positive contributions on both ends"
Why they playing Brook Lopez rn?
Why is brook Lopez in the game
Bud trolling. Did they buy him? Why Brook lopez coming into the game?
I remember Brook Lopez being called for a defensive 3-second violation at some point during the regular season - but that's the only one I've seen all year.
Brook Lopez never passes.  It's so funny
"That's why you see brook lopez, ayton in the paint 24/7   Back on 2019, everyone was camping paint on giannis"
Giannis isn't all there yet - but honestly as long as two of the three are there we're good. That or if the king Brook Lopez decides to win a game.
Better than Brook Lopez.
Brook Lopez 3s are so demoralizing
"Was referring to brook lopez grabbing cam johnson's arm with 2 hands, which is a foul."
jvg has some incredibly bad takes sometimes. booker shoulder checked pat connaughton a few games ago and he thought that should have been a no call. and he thinks brook lopez should apparently be allowed to hold back cam johnson by the shoulder to chase the baseline cutter. lol
"This Milwaukee lineup is sort of disgusting as fuck omg... i think Brook Lopez is sort of being exploited (but even if it was normal Brook and not the one getting worked in this series).  Giannis, Tucker, Lopez, Portis, and Middleton????  Omfg this is secret lineup type of shit"
Man I’d be afraid to crash the boards with hall of famer brook lopez in the paint too
"&gt;	4'36"" Brook Lopez  Fucking dying 😂"
Man a brook lopez fast break. What a treat
Brook Lopez reminds me of Chewbacca
"Brook Lopez logic. ""OK I'm taller then him. Time to do a fade away hook shot""...."
"4'36"" Brook Lopez trying to fadeaway chuck it over his 6'0"" defender in the post."
Brook Lopez is so trash on PnRs. Paul can have whatever he wants
You can clearly tell the game is in Phoenix. Did Chris Paul get touched?! Foul. Brook Lopez is held around the arms? That’s a legal and clean play.

Brook Lopez drops back way too much..step up
brook lopez has no place in this game. his mere presence is a defensive hole for the bucks. having giannis play on 5 renders cp3's and bookers pick n roll useless. the sooner bud realizes that the better
Brook Lopez is fucking useless
Can someone explain what Brook Lopez offers on either side of the floor
Brook Lopez just got snubbed for Javale McGee. Dudes gonna come in and drop 60
Brook Lopez is black dude…
"&gt;Right, because it's Giannis' fault this his teammates don't know how to knock down wide open shots. Do you hear yourself?  It’s Giannis’s fault that he’s useless outside of 3 feet...  &gt;And no, it's because Dame doesn't know how to beat a trap and just throws up bricks.  The trap works because Dame has no one to pass to...  &gt;Yeah because guys like Eric Bledsoe, Wesley Matthews, Nikola Mirotić, and Brook Lopez forgetting how to shoot a basketball would be much better what he has now.  You’re fucking hilarious. Making excuses for Giannis when he literally got outperformed by Lopez versus Miami...  All of those guys performing better would not make Giannis magically become useful outside of 3 feet from the rim...   &gt;It's actually hilarious how you're acting like Giannis has just been put in the best situations to succeed.  He hasn’t. But they’ve been sure of a hell a lot better than Dame’s. And no, it's because Dame doesn't know how to beat a trap and just throws up bricks."
"Perhaps, although CP3 reportedly had wanted to join Bucks the previous season.  By more expensive, I meant literally.  He had a much larger salary so Bucks would have had to trade more players to match contracts.  Bucks would have had to sacrifice Brook Lopez."
"&gt;And that was caused by a personnel issue, not Lillard himself.  Right, because it's Giannis' fault this his teammates don't know how to knock down wide open shots. Do you hear yourself?  And no, it's because Dame doesn't know how to beat a trap and just throws up bricks.   &gt;Give him Giannis’s team and he would have outperformed him by far.  Yeah because guys like Eric Bledsoe, Wesley Matthews, Nikola Mirotić, and Brook Lopez forgetting how to shoot a basketball would be much better what he has now.   It's actually hilarious how you're acting like Giannis has just been put in the best situations to succeed."
"And we also signed Brook Lopez, one of the best underrated contracts of the last decade that year.  Totally changed how we could play offense and defense."
An unofficial one online here on Reddit would be interesting and a shitstorm in the comments! As long as you're just judging playing ability and not saying racist shit I think it's fine to talk about. I was trying to figure out with my wife the other night who's the best white American guy in the NBA and it took us a long time. It was Kevin Love for a long time. But now? Brook Lopez maybe?
It really depends on the situation though.   Nets were in a similar situation during the tenure of Brook Lopez.   Dude was making Max $ when he wasn’t really worth it just because of the team history and the fact that Brooklyn wasn’t attracting Free Agents before the Sean Marks rebuilt recently.   Back in like 2015 after the Nets imploded w/ Billy King and D.Will era they gave Lopez a 3yr/$60m Max Deal because they were over the cap and had to give Boston all their picks. So it was either sign him or lose him with no real option to replace the production.   Think at the same time Thad Young got a 4yr/$50m deal for the same reason.    This was also right before the massive 2016 cap spike so that $20m that Lopez got was big money at the time.   Luckily after the cap spike it didn’t look as bad and Sean Marks flipped Thad Young for Caris LeVert and Brook Lopez for D’Lo and Mozgov which helped turn the tide and eventually help Brooklyn to sign Kyrie and KD.
"Ah yes because Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle and D'angelo Russell/Brook Lopez is definitely a worse team than the Kings starting 5...."
"Yeah my gripe with this is that he didn't necessarily call out James Harden lol  I think there's more to be stated of Lillard, CJ, Steph, Trae, Luka, Booker, Jokic, Kemba (before the last knee injury and surgery etc), Lavine, Vucevic, Sabonis, Beal, Russell when he was with the Nets, Curry... I mean the list goes on, I'm sure.  Now, the real question is, how many of these players actually have the capability, stamina, and athleticism to put up 25 a game while playing elite defense? The numbers drops significantly.   It's not like Steph doesn't try to defend, or Kemba, some of these guys are genuinely just not strong enough or have the defensive awareness (intangibles come to mind) to keep up with some of these guys on defense. Whereas guys like Lavine? Vucevic? Booker?   These guys got no excuse. They have the athleticism (or the height; see Brook Lopez and how he went from a sub-par defender to one of the best rim protectors in the league)"
"They got known e out because the Clippers were miles better than them. Mavs have generally over performed based on their roster of Luka, Latvian Brook Lopez and several 6th men."
Brook Lopez and Embiid maybe
Lol Chris Mihm was basically Brook Lopez minus all the skill.
"I could see the team moving on from Brook Lopez to improve the roster. Giannis and Middleton are too potent to give up on as both players are still in the front end of their prime.   Purely hypothetical, but a line-up of Giannis, Middleton, Jrue, Seth Curry, and Myles Turner, with Divincenzo, Portis, Tucker and Jalen Brunson off the bench. Or even swapping Jrue with someone like Brogdon would help (though I think Jrue's defense is a huge part of the Bucks' overall chances).  Point is, with Giannis, you've always got a chance, and with Middleton, you've got a legitimate 2nd option that can create his own shot. This team can contend for a very long time no matter who fills out roster."
"Christian Wood is not better than Brook Lopez, he has better upside (duh) but he isn’t better"
It's just a different era. Can you imagine someone like Shawn Bradley or George Muresan getting an NBA contract these days?  &amp;#x200B;  Modern NBA basketball has everyone pretty much going small-ball. Lumbering 7-footers even like Brook Lopez are getting played off the court in the playoffs due to the primacy of pick and roll matchup hunting.  &amp;#x200B;  Which is not how international basketball is played (due to the lack of a defensive 3 sec rule). A big is always useful as you can just plant them in the paint. There's a lot more jump shooting in international basketball because of this. Zone defense is a lot easier to execute.
Ayton can play for team usa because he was under 18 when he played for the bahamas. My choice is either him or brook lopez.
"Giannis, khris Middleton, jrue holiday, brook lopez"
"Robin &amp; Brook Lopez, Blake, Devonte Graham, Cam Payne. All these dudes are funny as fuck"
The best centers are foreign or hurt.  Brook Lopez is a decent choice
"They should get Brook Lopez. They need someone already in shape which seems like it would be hard to find in the middle of summer and him, Khris, and Jrue would already have chemistry."
"Zion and Trae Young should be the replacements. Maybe Brook Lopez or Jarrett Allen should be considered as well because the US needs a traditional big. Some random teams like the Czech Republic will just jam 2 seven footers into the paint, so Brook Lopez would be a guy that could offer good rim protection."
Brook Lopez has entered the chat
Either Drummond or Lopez would be a good addition just because Brook will get others rebounds even if not himself.
"Even Brook Lopez was only a 34% 3pt shooter this year  I think Al Horford still fits the bill, although his defense isn't what it was.  Turner shot 33.5% so he's meh  Embiid is definitely the best at both, comparatively speaking."
Brook Lopez or Embiid?
"If they needed both on a playmaking and perimeter defense then they should look for Lonzo but he is RFA. If they want big, then brook Lopez is one of the better option, right?"
"Lopez is a bit underrated imo.  For all the people here saying Portis should get his minutes, Portis is targeted even harder by CP3 when he is on the floor and not doing much better in any sense.  Lopez has a much better defensive IQ which is to be expected given the experience gap between him and bobby buckets, and Lopez is a very effective rim protector.  All that being said I love bobby portis.  You can say that traditional slower big rim protector role is moot in the playoffs given the last couple of match-ups but you can find numerous interviews, particularly Duncan Robinson, talking about how much of a difference Lopez was in the Heat series. Against certain matchups he is too slow and exploitable but there are other teams that he makes a tremendous impact by denying the rim as well as anybody.  If the Hawks had somebody like Lopez that could have been tremendous for them, it really depends on matchups.  Bud needs to be smart about when he uses Brook which interestingly enough he has been most of the playoffs.  Having an elite rim protector that can also threaten from deep with a couple of post moves in his pocket is not anywhere near the liability in the playoffs as everyone here suggests."
Following are 3pt percentage leaders of 2021 for starting centers  Kelly Olynyk	2020-21	34.2 Karl-Anthony Towns	2020-21	38.7 Brook Lopez	2020-21	33.8 Nikola Jokic	2020-21	38.8 13 more rows
Well Replace Noel with Brook Lopez
"You've already switched your argument from Luka was a way better rebounder to Luka is better for his size. I never said Luka was worse for his size. At 6'7 he's a pretty solid rebounder, but again, his numbers, like I previously said are inflated by uncontested rebounds and pushing the fast break.  Dirk grabbed 9.9 a couple of seasons and had a ton of seasons over 9 a game. He finished in the top 20 a number of seasons for rebounds per game and in the top 5 for defensive rebounds, that's pretty great company. He played out on the 3PT line, so his offensive rebounding numbers were never going to be high. Compare that to Tim Duncan who played close to the basket on offense so he was in a better position to grab offensive rebounds.  If we look at defensive rebounding numbers (Dirk played under the basket defensively like Duncan), Dirk peaked at 8.9 defensive rebounds per game, with multiple seasons in the 8-8.5 defensive rebounds per game range. Duncan peaked at 9.7 defensive rebounds per game. Shaq peaked at 9.6 defensive rebounds per game.  His defensive rebounding numbers are not far behind his contemporaries who are considered good rebounders.  Just looking at 10 RPG as a metric for a good rebounder is really reducing. For one it eliminates floor spacers like Dirk or KAT, and it also ignores guys like Stephen Adams or Brook Lopez who are great rebounders but maybe don't grab every rebound because they are boxing out."
Brook Lopez
"Brook Lopez was comically bad in FIBA in 2019, when team USA finished 7th at world cup  I like him on the bucks but man him and Turner looked terrible"
"That's fair. I would probably choose Young over Lavine and Ayton over Kevin Love.  Hell, give me Julius Randle over Kevin Love.   There's actually a long list of bigs I'd take over Kevin Love. I don't actually think he's one of the top 20 big men in the league. The majority of teams have a 4 or 5 better than him. I don't think I'm crazy in thinking that Nerlens Noel would be more useful. Or Brook Lopez, Blake Griffin, Jae Crowder...literally just random roleplaying guys about 6'8"" or so."
Brook Lopez? Bam Adebayo's good but he's already on the team
"Brook Lopez, but he's a bit preoccupied right now."
[Larry Nance Jr. on Brook Lopez](https://youtu.be/5pqfvWthszA)
yea it’s a lot more nuanced i agree and lots of teams make miscalculations along the way. i do think lots of us fans overrate the potential of young players because plenty of players with lots of potential land in the worst circumstance and never reach their potential. the bucks were historically bad. they made the right investments in players like Brook Lopez eventually.
Brook Lopez
Surprised Brook Lopez didn't make the cut. His first year or two on the bucks he was one of their best 3 point shooters.
"Some of the best players available would be:  Lonzo Ball   Mikal Bridges  Andrew Wiggins  Aaron Gordon  DeAndre Hunter / Clint Capela  Danilo Gallinari   Bogdanovic  Two of Brogdan, Sabonis, LaVert, Turner  Brook Lopez  Joe Ingles  Jordan Clarkson  Seth Curry  Harrison Barnes  So you could have a lineup like  Lonzo Ball, Andrew Wiggins, Mikal Bridges, Danilo Gallinari, Brook Lopez"
Giannis won the finals operating near the baseline off the dribble and KAT is a great shooter and can create of the dribble. It would be so difficult for defenses to match up against. Plus having size at the rim let’s Giannis over help. Giannis plus KAT or Jokic would be absurd. The question is basically is KAT a better Brook Lopez and the answer is yes
"The reason why I think the Lakers are a good example is because I knew people would look only at Lebron joining.  I'll admit, that was a product of our city and the team's legacy.  But Lebron isn't the product of tanking, AD is.  And its not that AD wanted to join our team, the reason tanking worked is because *we wouldn't have had the assets to trade for AD if we didn't tank*.  That's why tanking is a success story for the Lakers.  Even if you accept everything else about the Lakers drawing power for free agents, we still wouldn't have been able to get AD if we didn't get that #4 pick, or the consecutive years of #2's.  Had we actually tried, we would have been worse off even if Lebron did decide to join us.  As for the Timberwolves, I think you're doing what I said people are doing and making the wrong comparison.  The wrong thing to compare isn't tanking and non-tanking teams.  Ask yourself how good would the Timberwolves be vs. themselves if they didn't suck.  A Timberwolves team that didn't have KAT and had a bunch of middle first round picks.  They couldn't pair that up with Jimmy Butler and go to the playoffs, we've seen them suck for like 10 straight years, there's no reason to think they wouldn't have missed the playoffs for another decade like that.    Same thing with Philly.  Imagine they didn't have Embiid and Simmons and didn't go to the playoffs, but became Kings East.  They could have languished in the #10-15 seed like Detroit has with no future.  Speaking of Detroit, imagine they kept Blake and tried to make the playoffs every year.  We all know he's way past his prime, but could maybe give you a good game once a week.  Instead of Cade, they'd get some random pick in the #11-20 range because they were able to ride Blake and some other vet they traded for to the #9 seed.  And they decided to keep those guys together and try again next year with.  They would be worse off than they'd be sucking for the last few years and getting Cade.  I'll speak on the Lakers again since I know them the most.  In those years, we got guys like D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle, and a bunch of random players like Robert Sacre, Chris Kaman, Tarik Black, Lou Williams, Josh Hart, David Nwaba, Jordan Clarkson, Marcelo Huertas, Ivica Zubac, Brook Lopez, etc.  Some of these guys are pretty good role players, Brook just showed he isn't dead and helped to win a championship, even played a pivotal role in one of the Finals games.  As pieces, a lot of them can fit into a good team.  Clarkson was just 6th man of the year, Lou Williams has won that a couple of times, Julius Randle just posted a great season and lead the Knicks to the playoffs, D'Angelo Russell has become a more consistent shooter and fun player to watch, Zubac is probably an above average center on a team with championship aspirations.  But is that a championship team?  Can any of those guys realistically even now lead you to a championship?  Remember, without tanking we don't get Brandon Ingram, or Lonzo.  We'd get maybe Thon Maker, or Georgios Papagiannis (the wrong Giannis!), or TJ Leaf, or Frank Ntilikina, or Coby White, Trey Lyles, etc.  Pelicans don't want those guys for AD.  We're not trading Stanley Johnson as the centerpiece in an Anthony Davis trade, we'd be luck to get Ed Davis in a trade!  Yeah, it was pretty brutal to watch for a while, but so what?  The owners are almost all billionaires, I don't shed any tears for them, they'll never be homeless or miss a meal.  Let the arena be empty, let them lose money, this is a long term plan and when you win, the fans will come back, guaranteed.  Or they could mismanage the team for decades and have what the Kings, Wolves, and Magic have right now.  I doubt Philly or the Lakers would trade their team for those players."
"robin lopez, hes like brook lopez but more of a wwe wrestler who has a great disdain for mascots"
You’re citing advanced defensive metrics that are pretty much entirely team based. Donte plays on a team of elite (and I mean elite) defenders. DPOY and arguably the best defensive guard in Jrue Holiday. Brook Lopez is also a great rim protector. No shit his defensive metrics are gonna be through the roof. Nobody who watches him play believes he’s an elite defender.   &gt;better than OG that season  He’s not even better than OG in his rookie season defensively
"&gt;KD was just very unsuccessful against Giannis.  While I wouldn’t deny this in general. In OT of game 7, Giannis didn’t guard KD on one shot attempt. I don’t think Giannis was why he was unsuccessful these past playoffs especially since Giannis did not spend a lot of time on him. It was Jrue holiday/Khris/and even Brook Lopez who caused him issues in that OT"
"The bucks were getting murdered in the suns serie whenever Jeff replaced holiday that the bucks experimented with a meme lineup with 3 bigs (Bobby Portis , brook Lopez, Giannis) and it worked better 😂"
The 2019 ECF game 1 epic duel between Kyle Lowry and Brook Lopez is one of the stranger hype playoff games I’ve ever seen.
Brook Lopez
"Myles Turner  Nerlens  Robert Williams  Brook Lopez  AD  &amp;#x200B;  Gobert is the best rim protector in the league, but as a pure shot blocker he's not quite there imo"

"Purely shot blockers:   Myles Turner, Mitchell Robinson, Nerlens Noel, Chris Boucher, Rudy Gobert, Kristaps Porziņģis, Hassan Whiteside, Clint Capella all come to mind. All of them are great at block shots eplicitly. But not all of them are elite level interior defenders &amp; rim protectors.   Best rim protectors/interior defenders is a similar list, but it excludes players who are great at getting blocks but not doing much else defensively. That list for me would be:   Rudy Gobert, Clint Capella, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Brook Lopez, Bam Adebayo etc..."
Brook Lopez is up there
"Also because fucking Terry Stotts implemented the ""Brook Lopez"" drop coverage on the pick and roll... beening dumbass but still coaching next season."
"Appreciate the Duncan love. Was a Nets fan when y'all drafted Brook Lopez, had hopes for him becoming the next Duncan but bigger and stronger. Sadly it didn't happen"
"I don't think anyone is pretending like the blazers are a good defensive team. But teams that are not obnoxiously deep can't typically guard every scheme well.look at the bucks which were the best defensive team in the playoffs: Pg tucker was the best Defender against KD and he was bad against the hawks. Brook Lopez completely locked down bam adebayo and he was a liability against quick guards in the p&amp;r against the hawks, suns and Kyrie Irving. There are few guys in the league who can adjust against everybody and no team is able to stack them.    For the jazz the problem was Golbert offense not his defense. No player in the NBA history can guard five guys in the perimeter who can take their opponent off the dribble and shoot threes at 39%+ , and protect the rim because everybody else was getting beat.  If he dunked on them every possession they would have changed that offense real quick"
Brook Lopez
Brook Lopez blocking key shots vs KD.
"That would be a waste of KAT's offensive abilities, he would just become better Brook Lopez. His opportunity to eat would be when Giannis is on the bench."
AD is looking at Brook Lopez like BBQ chicken
"That's only part of the equation by the way.  1. There were multiple plays where he was walled, he wasn't walled the entire series, but I can show you multiple plays where 3-4 players were comitted to him. 2. He was playing off-ball a lot this series. You can't wall someone who has a chance of not even getting the ball, and when he does, it's usually at the rim so no point in a wall there. 3. When he is walled, he found cutters who penetrated behidn the wall. While you are right about the shooting being bad, a wide open shot at the rim for cutters like Connaughton/Portis/Lopez is the most efficient play in basketball, 4. There's also the fact that he still manages to averaged around 24 ppg against the wall, so even if you did it, you're not completely stopping him, even though you are reducing his role. 5. Like I said before, Jrue is a better shooter than ever before, and before our only consistent shooter was Brook. Even KMids was bad. Different story this year, where Connaughton/Middleton were good, and yes 2 good shooters is a low number, but it is more good shooters than we've had in the last 3 years"
Steph Curry / Andrew Wiggins / Gordon Hayward / Pascal Siakam / Brook Lopez  Matisse Thybulle
"The one where two Nets players are holding Brook Lopez' arms down without a whistle with barely minutes left in the game was the worst one for me. That and Blake Griffin grabbing PJ off ball, causing PJ to get his 6th foul and get sent out when he tried to get away."
"That was Brook Lopez, and your point about opposing teams bricking every shot in the last two minutes goes against your point: that requires clamp down defense in critical moments, which is something that the great teams do, not the lucky ones.  Of course you need some breaks, but that was the best fucking basketball I've ever watched, and having watched every game that season I think your take is absurd."
Giannis  Khris  Jrue  Brook Lopez   Donte Divincenzo  Bobby Portis  Pat Connaughton  And idk Grayson Allen
"Brook Lopez I'm pretty sure. That said I remember compiling a spreadsheet of Pythagorean wins and the Warriors were one of the absolute biggest over achievers in NBA history and won like 7 or 8 more games than they ""should have"".      Either way they were still dominant and the fact they'd always win those tight games was so demoralising for teams. I remember back in the day when every win against Golden State prompted an upvote party in team subreddits."
"CEO's of Fortune 500 companies are akin to NBA players in their fields. They are the best of the best. And are responsible for Billion/Trillion dollar companies. The average Fortune 500 salary is ~$13.1MM, or the same as Brook Lopez."
Embiid is like a billionaire's Brook Lopez I think it'd work well. Embiid can space the floor and Giannis isn't gunshy.
Brook Lopez would be a great fit for the pelicans but unfortunately there's very few guys like him in the league
"I’m not sure where all these sports writers think that a stretch five who’s good enough to draw defenders away from Zion is supposed to come from. Zion has a 62% 2-point field goal percentage. You’d have to find a center who shoots 41% from 3 for it to be a good idea to guard them outside instead of doubling Zion inside. The only player that come close to that percentage are Jokic, Vucevic, and KAT who are all difficult to impossible to trade for.   They would also have to be good defensively to make up for Zion and BI’s deficiencies in that area. The only good defender in the top 20 3pt % centers is Brook Lopez who shoots 34%. The Pelicans need a defensive center much more than they need a stretch five. Just let Zion get his on offense and focus on fixing this team defensively."
Brook Lopez
Brook Lopez injured Saric
"Doesn't make him a point guard, it makes him a playmaker. Same with Jokic. Westbrook grabs lots of rebounds and mostly scores inside, doesn't make him a big man. Brook Lopez has the 3-pointer as one of his most important skills, and that doesn't make him a wing."
Did he get guarded like Buddy Hield or Duncan Robinson? Definitely not. Did he get guarded like Brook Lopez or Myles Turner? Definitely not. The truth is that teams were definitely defending him at the 3 pt line last season but not making a huge priority of it.  And posting a stat that most of his 3 pt shots were open is pretty pointless because that's true of every player in the league.
"At worst case scenario, He'll be a Frank Kaminsky/Mike Muscala where he might get some time in the regular season as a 2nd or 3rd string big   Best case scenario, he improves as a shot blocker and keeps the weight off to be Brook Lopez lite or somewhere in the middle between those options  He has a spot in this league one way or another"
"No you don't. What are you gonna do, have the guy play the 3? Get rid of Brook Lopez and have Giannis play the 5?"
"Gasol and Brook Lopez went from shooting zero threes a game in their first 8 seasons to consistently being a threat in the latter half of their careers. I believe Brook has made most 3’s by a center in their career.   Realistically… the GOAT could become a great 3 point shooter if he needed to adjust to that game, like the mentioned two big men above. Especially when shooting is considered easier for wings and guards."
Wdym? Brook Lopez still has PTSD from KD blocking him in the low post
Nenad Krstic at his best &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nets centers not named Brook Lopez
well sometimes it helps but I guess it depends on the type of center. Brook Lopez had that huge block on KD in OT of Game 7 just as an example
It think it was Brook Lopez scoring 24 points lmao. Haven’t been to very many (any) individually great games.
"&gt; 3 year age gap  Does not matter at all. No player is better than another because they're younger.  &gt; while playing less games in the playoffs than Herro when the heat got swept.  You know Donte got injured, right? Your comment sounds like you think the coach pulled him from the playoffs. In either case, this is a bizarre argument. A team winning in spite of a player being injured does not mean that player is not good? Bucks won 2 without Giannis; is Brook Lopez a better player?  Anyway I'm not extending three games to be representative of a player like I'm not extending four games to be representative of a player."
Robin Lopez is a poor mans Brook Lopez
Brook Lopez can’t do that though
&gt;I know every guy in the NBA can beat me in a 3/4 court sprint.  Giving Brook Lopez and Kyle Anderson a bit too much credit here.
"By 4 points, over Buck Williams, who only played there 8 seasons and never even got to 20 PPG in a season.  You tell me who that says more about, the Nets or Brook Lopez lmao. He's very clearly a role player, and never ended up taking that superstar leap."
Are you joking? Embiid-Randle-Lavine is def on the same level as Giannis-Middleton-Jrue. Smart and Wiggins better than Brook Lopez and Pat Cummington
"Can’t think of just one player  Fox, Isaac (when healthy), Brook Lopez, Jae’Sean tate, Dillon brooks, tj McConnell, richaun Holmes, Larry nance"
Drummond. Brook Lopez. Emeka Okafor.
"Most underrated guy must be a guy on a good team, guy who is not considered a top performer for a team yet he is a crucial piece but at the same time thought of as expendable or replaceable. Also he can't be very young as it is too easy to underrate a young, developing player.  It can't be a second all star on a contending team or an all star but one that isn't praised as the second coming or the best player on a bad team.  So using these criteria I can safely say that Seth Curry is for sure one of the most underrated players. Mavs thought they can trade him for Richardson and we saw what happened. In Philly he played fourth fiddle to Embiid, Simmons and Harris meanwhile in many games was the person who stood between win or total collapse.   Other picks: Brook Lopez"
"Ah, yes, the game that proved you should not switch Brook Lopez on every possession."
And as good as bam is against perimeter players he get beat 1v1 by slow bigs like brook Lopez that get played off the floor in other matchups. So you have to take the good with the bad. I can see him playing PF in another team
Brook Lopez and Andrew Bynum of all people?
"Lol what are you talking about, rookie KG was a twig compared to rookie Dwight. He didn't bulk up out of need, he bulked up cause he had the genetics for it and loved working out.   Brook lopez didn't even get drafted until Dwight's 5th year and Bynum wasn't even good until around that time either. Dwight was already huge by his second season"
"Carlisle is overrated as hell, every team he has coached had a Hof on it, sometimes two and has had many all star level players. If you add up both their careers to this point you can argue Bud has been better. If you want to do the last decade, Bud has been hands down better and even owns him in head to heads.   No way you can say his coaching was bad these playoffs and turn around and lobby for Carlisle lol.  The mavs lost a series where they were ahead 3-2 coming home and Luka had one of the best series ever, and oh yea he turned around and quit because he didn’t get along with a 21 generational talent about to ink a long term deal. That’s the coach you want?   How the hell was Buds coaching bad? I dare somebody bring up the drop defense and Brook Lopez after the bucks were elite(historic in 2019,2021) on the defensive end with that scheme and Brook on the floor for the 3rd straight playoffs."

"I think this is where the tier list is fundamentally lacking. If you go off of pure defensive stats, sure Lillard is really bad. But it is way more nuanced than that. The context of overall team defense and matchups changes the picture.  Embiid has Simmons and Thybulle on his team who make his defensive load much less. Plus he is guarding the likes of Brook Lopez and Adebayo as the best centers in the East (behind Embiid of course).  Meanwhile, Dame not only has to take a huuge offensive load, but he is forced to guard the best guards in the league! Dame matches up with Steph, CP3, Jamal Murray etc. And the rest of the team is trash at defense so he has no help on the weak side"
"I once saw Robin walking to a minor league baseball. He was with another tall guy and an average height guy. I thought to myself that mofo is tall! Wait, that's fucking Robin Lopez! It didn't hit me until a hour or two later. Wait that other tall was Brook!"
"A center like Brook Lopez would help too, an elite rim protector that is also a threat from 3."
Quite a lot of posts seem to indicate by their wording that they thought the OP was talking about Brook Lopez.
"What is the most important step Brook Lopez can take? It's not the first step is it? It is the next step, always the next step."
Brook and Robin Lopez are two of the most interesting people in the NBA lol
"PG Curry 40  SG Danny Green 8  SF Lebron James 39  PF PJ Tucker 5  C Brook Lopez 16  Bench  PG Jamal Murray 8  PF: Markieff Morris 2  SF: Igoudala 2  No one beating this team  Covers everything. Everyone can switch on defense. Good defenders around Curry that can shoot, just enough playmaking with Curry, Murray, and Lebron. Spot up guys that don’t need playmaking In Tucker and Green. Able to go small with Lebron, Igoudala, Tucker at the 4-5 late in games. Everyone has plenty of playoff experience and in fact all have great reputations in playoffs"
"I think this is the biggest thing.   Brook Lopez shot 31% in 2019-20 but he's still a floor spacer because of his quick trigger and confidence.   Turner shoots well for a big but compared to a regular shooter he's pretty slow and too cautious.   People misunderstood Horford for the same reason. He could PnP with us but when he signed with Philly everyone expected him to be lights out as the recipient of drive-and-kicks. Horford was too slow and cautious to be considered a true shooting threat, even if his percentages were decent.   The most extreme case is Amir Johnson, he shot 41% in his last season with Boston but his 3PAs took longer than some people's FTAs. His shot was only relevant when teams openly refused to contest him."
Brook Lopez
Rare sighting of Nets legend Brook Lopez
The only people Trae cooked on the switch were Seth and Danny Green but even still that's way more effective then letting the man with the best floater get to his sweet spot.  Trae is a good not great iso scorer and he takes a lot of deep threes even though he isn't the best at that.  That's far more effective defense as the Bucks proved than walling off the rim and allowing for open threes from great spot up shooters.  Remember in the Bucks series he pretty much bullied Brook Lopez off the court in game 1 and the Bucks had to start hedging higher on the screen and occasionally using low resistant switches with their traditional big men.  Ultimately going to Giannis at center and switching 1 thru 5 stopped Trae when he was healthy because again he isnt the best iso scorer.
It is not about over the season but over specific matchup that get exploited in the post season. For the same reason that brook Lopez is a liability against certain teams
"Brook Lopez but you trade any semblance of defensive abilities and the ability to shoot threes for some playmaking. Watching Domantas score is almost exactly the same as watching brook score, sabonis just gets the ball more"
"The Lakers front office utterly blew their rebuild and it didn't matter because Lebron decided to go there and then AD forced his way there.  They drafted Russell #2 and then dumped him for Brook Lopez and the 28th pick (which they got lucky turned into Kuzma who at least was an asset). Then they let Brook Lopez walk for no reason considering he would've been an amazing center to play with Lebron. They traded Zubac (a nice prospect on a rookie deal) for Mike Muscala for ""shooting"" even though that team was going absolutely nowhere that season, and Muscala was gone after that year.  They also took Lonzo over Tatum which in hindsight was a terrible move.  They also let Randle go who turned out to be a really good player.  Everything they did for like 4 years was a bad move and it didn't even matter."
"Brook Lopez, who we picked up on a minimum because he was supposed to be washed. George Hill, who we picked up part way through the season when we were already 16-8. And was also supposed to be washed. Ilyasova… Are you serious?  We went from the 19th best defence in the league to first in one offseason. While having a better defensive rating with Lopez off the floor than on, despite Bud having him playing good defence for the first time in his decade-long career. Because Jason Kidd is a shithouse coach.  Also in his last season when he got fired midway, we had a better record with Joe Prunty than we did with him. Who the fuck is Joe Prunty."
"They also added brook Lopez, George hill and ilyasova  but those guys probably don't make your team better...  I mean look at how much the roster improve in that off season dude"
"""At worst a Brook Lopez""???  Bro... seriously????  Lmao people really be overreacting like crazy to Summer League games.   Brook Lopez is the all-time leading scorer for a franchise, made all-defensive second team two seasons ago, and was a starter for the NBA championship team this year.   There is 0.000001% chance Garza sniffs Brook Lopez' game (and I like what I see from Garza).  Also he is extremely slow and bad on defense even for a center, that's a pretty huge difference from Brook lol"
"The nets being a disappointment to u is only an opinion. Kinda seems like most teams disappoint except for that one who gets to raise the trophy at the end … teams make adjustments every year that tends to happen… I think he did his job. Made Giannis better and the team and star player improved. I didn’t expect Kidd and those nets teams to win it lol… that’s the offense he had to run lol that’s all giannis can still do years later and to me because they won doesn’t seem to be because kidd was the problem. Years passed, giannis got better. Best team in the league whoah lol… crazy brook Lopez the difference maker and coach bud the new Greg popp 😂… I think the nets being hurt, and facing a team who hadn’t made playoffs let alone finals in more than a decade was the difference not kidd or bud or a twin"
"It was recent but Brook Lopez not SHOOTING THE GODDAMN BALL TO TAKE TIME OFF THE CLOCK in game 7.  If he had just shot it there's a chance the whole ""KD's foot on the 3-pt line"" thing doesn't even happen"
"Brook Lopez turning the ball over and stopping the clock, letting KD cook and he sends the game to overtime"
Brook Lopez is Batman and Robin is Robin
"The Nets were disapointment.  The Bucks were decent one year until the league figured out that their ultra agressive defensive scheme was easily beatable, he never adjusted to that, never even tried Giannis at the 5, and let them be a bad defense despite having solid defenders.  Their offense was all isos and post up, there was no structure, the rotation was weird.  &amp;#x200B;  Giannis loving him is great, good for him, I think Giannis going from borderline playoff team to best team in the league just by adding a real coach and Brook Lopez says more"
Not even in Nets history. Brook Lopez and even Robin Lopez are both huge dorks lmao
"I do not understand why he fell so far.  Please tell me.  He's at worst a Brook Lopez, and thats godlike already!"
More Brook Lopez without the defense. He’s an extremely efficient on catch and shoot three pointers and has the moves to score from anywhere. He just isn’t a great defender and often found himself in foul trouble in college.
What would you say is his ceiling? Like a brook lopez or marc gasol?
Brook Lopez in at center
"Because he’s a big, he doesn’t get much credit- but I’d have to argue Brook Lopez being a dominant rim protector and consistent from 3 makes him one of the most valuable players in the league"
"Brook Lopez very underrated here, probably the most crucial 3&amp;D player in the league."
"Look I'm not saying he deserved that $84M or that he's not dumb for turning down that money. But the way this free agency has shaken out as been bizarre and extremely unlucky for him. Spencer Dinwiddie is (IMO) not even a better player than Schroeder, and he's getting paid OVER THREE TIMES as much as him.  This reminds me of when the entire league randomly froze out Brook Lopez in 2018 and the Bucks got him on a minimum."
"I love at the start Pat’s slightly sad, weak look and posture next to the much smaller and more hyper Chris Paul right before he snaps into action.  Looks like the Bucks initial inbound play is get the ball to Jrue and have everyone else crash the boards while he makes sure he finds the rim. Seems like a smart play given the circumstances.  They definitely learned from the Brook Lopez incident, he wasn’t even on the floor."
Not that great on the perimeter but damn that inside footwork and the use of his body to wall up is impressive. Love his energy and craft.  I see a little of early brook lopez in his game.
"Yeah, it was dramatically different. For instance in Harden’s first year in Houston, Brook Lopez was top 10 in ppg with 19 ppg. This year, KD ranked 10th with 27 ppg. It’s crazy to see how fast the game has changed."

Brook Lopez would like a word
"context: at the end of the last game Bynum had made a 3...think Dwight or Rodman throwing up 3's at the end of games. I believe Bynum swished it too. Also, Bynum had a nice touch from midrange and was a good free throw shooter for a true center. I think on this play he was just feeling himself a bit, and shot it because it was open.  I know he got benched, and I know people have memed it into his ""idgaf"" attitude, but I never took issue with it. As others have said, he was kind of ahead of the curve here. If he was still around when D'Antoni came, I'm sure he would have been like Brook Lopez and went from never shooting to always shooting"
"Shit, one of the worst games I've ever been to was Hawks at Brooklyn. Tickets for $27 to sit in the lower level. Got to see Hawks legend Dwight Howard vs Brook Lopez going 1 for 55 from 3.  I'm sure those same seats for the same teams would cost a little more now"
"LA: Westbrook, Harden, Paul Pierce, Kawhi, Kevin Love. Jrue Holiday, PG, Brook Lopez, Tyson Chandler, Baron Davis, Reggie Miller, Klay, Gilbert Arenas off the bench"
Brook lopez still has a significant post game and cna rebound. He might be exploitable but he can abuse smaller players still
I think he’d be a lot better as a PF/C next to another big that can stretch the floor like Brook Lopez but Jokic/KAT are too good on offense to take away touches from them to give to Ben
"I met Brook Lopez in line for Space Mountain at Disney World a few years back. Didn’t say much to him cause I was nervous and he wanted to keep it low key but he was nice enough, even let us go ahead of him in line. I’ve been a fan of his ever since"
Blake Griffin and Brook Lopez are on two teams
"For sure. Fit is an issue and there's not many good ways to maximize his playstyle. You also have to wonder if it's worth it. Like you said, other than Towns, there aren't many elite, if any. Maybe Jokic since Jokic works with anyone on offense haha. I think the best fit would be a star guard that can shoot and run PnR and an okay stretch big. So like Dame, Steph, Harden, CP3, Trae, Luka, etc and a guy like Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, KP, Olynyk, Dieng idk.  Agreed on your other two points. And that ties into his mentality and attitude imo. The stuff you listed as fundamental holes can also be resolved with improved mentality. He may always be a bad shooter or a bad free throw shooter but he can control being afraid of getting fouled or taking open shots.  I'm just saying the fit with Embiid isn't ideal but it doesn't really matter. Embiid shouldn't be fitting with Simmons but the other way around. Simmons doesn't seem to want to add anything to his game"
"Dw I know it's not a serious thing. If I separate the individual voices out most fanbases are kinda chill. I like hanging around in the team subs and most of them are pretty cool; I like post-Harden Rockets fans generally, Raptors fans are cool on their sub and Hawks fans are generally fantastic people and honestly made the reddit fun as a Bucks fan even during the conference finals.  The Nets sub got *very* ugly when Giannis got injured (had a post telling people to stop celebrating injuries, a lot of its comments celebrating the injury as much as you can while avoiding a ban), but it also feels like Nets sub has two groups where one has been around for a while ('I'm just happy Brook Lopez got a ring') and ones who migrated with Harden/superteam fans ('Giannis deliberately injured Kyrie'), so I think the worst is just a product of a large gathering of stans and less so representative of the teams fans generally. Anyway I feel like Bucks fans, including myself, have got just a level of defensiveness that is definitely taught (Jamal Murray being injured does not make the Bucks frauds, Nuggets got swept with 3 blowouts, most Nuggets fans don't even seem to think that he puts them in the finals), but is still obnoxious so eh."
"Ben Simmons has a short wingspan for his size, whereas Giannis is ridiculously long. Ben Simmons is afraid of getting fouled, where Giannis is not great at free throws, but can never be accused of being scared. Finally, because Brook Lopez can stretch out to 5, Giannis has so much more space, because he's playing with other shooters. Embiid who can stretch and is good at it, doesn't want to stretch out too much, and shouldn't have to. Why run inefficient offense for Ben Simmons when you have the best post player in the game?"
"&gt;clearly wasnt referring to you as a clown.   Ok, like the respect but dont just call other people clowns if they believe something you dont.   &gt;there’s no clear consensus and some of the top comments were even arguing that the Cavs supporting cast was actually better.   Well, just went to take a look and so far i’ve only seen 1 guy in 20+ comments picking the Cavs. I’d also like to bring out a point one guy had: the nets showed some defensive-backbone. That nets team was one of the best defensive teams in the playoffs this year. They had a 105.6 DRTG against the Bucks, way above average. The Cavs had a 111.8 DRTG against the Pacers, below average. And do they compensate that on offense? No. 105.5 ORTG. That Cavs team was just all around bad. Even with an all-time great, they were below average on both ends of the court. In contrast, the Nets had a better ORTG than the Cavs (still below average), but made up for it on defense.   That is why the Nets were able to compete with the Bucks. They held Milwaukee to a 105 ORTG. That Cavs team held to Pacers to a whopping 111.8 ORTG. Just a comparison of how each team fared against each other.   That Cavs team couldnt stop the Oladipo Pacers. The Nets, however, could slow down the champion Bucks. Thats how bad the Cavs are.   &gt;thats part pf the reason why his superteams lived up to expectations.   Not true, it has more to do with the competition he faced, the ridiculously high expectations, and health issues. The only time his playmaking was detrimental was in 2011. In fact, his teams actually exceed the expectations of the roster. 2007 and 2018 Cavs had no chance in competing or even being in the Finals yet Lebron dragged them there. Why? Because he didnt try to play hero ball (except that 1 game).   Basketball is a team game. You’re not beating the other team by yourself in a 48 minute game, much less a 7-game series.   &gt;He gets his teammates involved in a different way  Yea, a way that would run him to the ground. Sure it is a effective way of getting good shots, but not a stamina-friendly one. He barely lasted the first 48 mins of game 7, and that Cavs vs Pacers series would need him to play 40+ mins a game 7 times. He aint lasting that long with that playstyle. Why? Because he’s aggressive everytime. Lebron mastered the way to save energy on defense and at times offense, which allowed to last that long. Kd doesnt have that same skill, so everytime down the court, he’s gonna be putting in energy to find his shot or pass it out. And every possession afterwards he’s gonna get more and more tired that by the time the 4th quarter arrives and its still a close game (there abt 5 of which in the Cavs-Pacers series), he wouldnt have enough energy to pull the team through 4 times.   &gt;He was a show size away from eliminating them.   Again, you also need to remember how bad the Buck’s offense was that series. The difference between their offense in the finals and that series is night and day, and that’s thanks to the Nets’ defense. Kd aint enjoying that same defensive intensity in Cleveland. Holiday and Middleton all shot 5-23 and 9-26 respectively. Brook Lopez went 7-11 but was outmatched by Griffin’s 7-12 and Bruce Brown’s 7-9.   The 2 worst performers for the Bucks missed 35 shots total. The 2 worst performers for the Nets missed 20. Thats why the Nets were in the game. DEFENSE. Aint no one and no way on this world gonna believe that that Cavs team is gonna stop stars on the same level as Middleton and Holiday in the same game.   Its not that Kd’s method was working fine, it was that the defense was working great. What happened in OT? Kd burned out, the offense turned to absolute shit, and they couldnt make use of their great defensive effort. See the correlation? Kd burn out = offense dies out.   &gt;not everyone needs to be a playmaker to carry his team.   So why hasnt anyone else done so? Dirk definitely didnt carry 2011 Mavs, they had a great roster. Chauncey didnt carry 2004 Pistons, their defense lifted them over the top. Curry in 2019 without Klay couldnt even get a game. Even Michael Jeffrey Jordan himself couldnt get the win despite dropping 63 points. Why? Cuz he tried to outscore Boston by himself.   As i said before, basketball is a team game. You are not, and i mean NOT, going to beat a team equal or better than you by trying to outscore them yourself. You need your teammates to get involved and share the burden somewhat so that when it comes down the wire, you still have what it takes to pull your team through. Only one man in Nba history has been able to carry his team through  sheer will bu outscoring the opposing team. 1 man.   Wilt Chamberlain."
Brook Lopez back to Nets confirmed.
Almost any team would. What teams would rather have post centric valancunis than far superior floor spacer and defender brook lopez ??
"And nobody used that rationale cause it leads to the complete prioritization of 3 and D players. For example, I’m pretty sure 90% of teams would take brook lopez over valancunis, Capela, Vucevic and co. Would you consider him a better player ? Most teams would take a jrue holiday, Malcolm brogdon or Kyle Lowry over Russ. Are they better players ? Just wanna see how consistent your logic is.  And white is a pretty average 3 point shooter."
I dont see LeBron and Brook Lopez is on there twice lol
Brook Lopez with the mid-season trade.
Would have to be a 3 way trade.   Milwaukee will gladly take KAT. You can have one gently used Brook Lopez.
"People were also acting like KD was getting mauled by PJ Tucker and the refs were handling Giannis with baby gloves. The truth of the matter is that the reffing was super inconsistent from road-to-home, and I'd say evened out in the end (or skewed towards the Nets since they had 1 more home game, and Griffin/Harden got away with a bit more BS).  But people were just trying to speak it into existence like ""man the Bucks out here playing rugby and KD STILL dropping 40.. imagine if they let KD play basketball."" Meanwhile, KDs getting calls like this https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=19&amp;GameID=0042000212&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Lopez%20S.FOUL%20(P1.T1)%20(P.Fraher)&amp;sct=plot  I think Brook got the worst whistle of that series... he couldn't be as aggressive in rim defense because of calls like that, and he couldn't take advantage of his size on the other end (when the Nets mostly played without a center) because they just let him get mauled in the post and on rebounds. We saw Brook unleashed against the Hawks when the whistle wasn't against him, and he looked like a stud.  I realize this strayed wildly from the original topic haha"
Yea I don't see a rivalry. If anything I'm pumped you guys won (after us I mean) and I bet a lot of Nets fans feel similarly. Lot of love for Brook Lopez and honestly who doesn't like Giannis
"Giannis had Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday, both all star caliber level players. Granted no one expected Brook Lopez to turn back the clock"
"Joel Embiid is in the Giannis superstar class. He's a different sort of player, but if you took the gang of useless scrubs Joel has and put them around Giannis, then he also bounces out in the playoffs.  Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday, PJ Tucker, Bobby Portis, Donte diVincenzo and  Pat Connaughton backing up Joel ? And Brook Lopez on the bench for when Joel needs to sit down ? Yeah, I can see them winning a championship."
"There have also never been less offensive rebounds per game than there is today. 86-87 was Chuck's peak OREB year. There were 14.7 OREBs per game on average, and Barkley brought in 5.7 of them. Last season there was 9.8 a game and Zion grabbed 2.7.  Interestingly enough the Sixers team he was on was under the league average in OREBs (14.4), conversely the Pelicans last year lead the league in OREBs at 11.7 a game, Adams grabs 3.7 of them, Zion 2.7, and Willy Hernangomez 2.5.   Capela was the lead leader with 4.7 which is pretty surprising to me considering the Hawks are at the bottom of the league in FA and middle of the league in FG%.  I think all of that points to four major things things.   One is that Charles is just an all time elite offensive rebounder. One of the best of all time.   Another is that Zion is on a team with an elite offensive rebounder in Adams, and another above average one in Willy. So even if Zion could go grab 4-5 a night the opportunity is probably taken by the other two often enough, and he can spare his body the extra jumps.  Thirdly I imagine the steady year-by-year decrease in OREBs has a lot to do with the increased 3pt rate creating longer rebounds that end up with the guards and the decreased rate of contested paint shots/paint packing.   Lastly the rest of it probably has to do with scheming. Box outs, rebound philosophy, transition, etc. You see a lot more of centers boxing out for the guards to grab the rebounds now than you used to a-la Brook Lopez, centers with Westbrook, etc."
"Embid can't guard 1-5.  You need someone who can guard them and come off switches .  Who does embid have to guard at his position on a nightly basis in his conference. Clint capella just catches lobs, bam has no jumper, Celtics, wizards, nets no serious threat down low. Brook Lopez is outside the paint spacing for giannas.  Nerlen Noel's is a defensive player.   Verse simmons having to pick up. Trae young, westbrook, kyrie or James harden,  Jimmy butler, Tatum, . All with different skills sets ? A.d. was basically a glorified kevin love with the pelicans. Always hurt and your team can never win."
Who the fuck is looking up Brook Lopez?
Every version of prime Shaq is more agile than 2021 Brook Lopez and yet we just saw the Bucks getting away with enough Lopez playing drop coverage minutes to win a chip.
I get:  1. LeBron 2. Kareem 3. Russ 4. Hakeem 5. Wilt 6. MJ 7. Vucevic 8. Bill Russell 9. Drummond 10. Brook Lopez 11. Valanciunas 12. DeMarcus Cousins 13. Tim Duncan 14. Kobe 15. Horford 16. Myles Turner 17. Marc Gasol 18. DeAndre Jordan 19. Steven Adams 20. Giannis 21. Pau 22. Kanter 23. Nurkic 24. Robin Lopez 25. LaMarcus Aldridge 26. McGee 27. Rose 28. Ibaka 29. Kidd 30. Steph 31. Dwight Howard 32. Shaq 33. Blake Griffin 34. KD 35. Kevin Love 36. Kelly Olynyk 37. Dame 38. AD 39. LaVine 40. Jokic 41. CP3 42. Pippen 43. Barkley  Very big-heavy. Something like 3/4 are bigs.
Was at a Wizards preseason game and got tickets right next to the Bucks tunnel.   Brook Lopez is very chill and said he’d check out the Bucks subreddit. Always has a smile on his face and seems like a great guy.
"2016 Steph Curry - 30/5/7/2/0 on .669 TS% and not even a top 50 defender.   Giannis 2020 must be better than Steph 2016 then? If only ranking seasons was as easy as laying out statlines and comparing numbers. Your entire concept is flawed.  2019 Giannis wasn't even deserving of the MVP, so let's talk about the 2020 version. An All-Star in Khris Middleton, 2 All-Defense teammates in Brook Lopez and Eric Bledsoe. Weaker Eastern Conference. Giannis got the DPOY too because of a superior record and his team being defense-oriented. The majority wanted AD to get the award instead.  2021 Jokic did not have his best teammate in Jamal Murray for the business end of the season, and even he wasn't an All-Star. Without Jamal and basically any other guards, Nuggets somehow started winning more games. Finished 3rd in a stacked West, leaving behind legit contenders like the Clippers and Lakers.  Apart from all of this, Jokic almost had a 50/40/90 season as a big, which is almost impossible and unheard of. He couldn't miss games because Nuggets would lose every game by double digits otherwise. This should be reason enough to consider his historic MVP season over Giannis'.   Jokic is a shooting big while Giannis is a paint presence, and yet Jokic had a better TS. 2018 Harden is debatable, but both of Giannis' years were not that impressive, atleast not more than Jokic's."
Giannis  Luka  Middelton  Ben Simmons  brook lopez  Saddiq bey  Jerami grant  Tim hardaway jr  Reggie Jackson  Steven Adam’s  Dwight Howard  Bobby Portia   Curry Lebron Klay  Ayton Jaren Jackson Cade Cunningham Drose  Brook lopez Beef stew Marcus smart  Dame Jokic Tatum  Booker  Lopez Beef stew  Saddiq  Lu dort  Thybulle Haliburton Draymond  Buddy heild  Which is the best??
"giannis and curry as superstars, davis may be a better fit (arguably?) but is less rekiable health wise   giannis can be a super draymond in offense as a pick and roll partner who can playmake when curry goes off ball, and curry spacing would be lethal   best inside and outside scorers in the league right now  for all stars i need shooting and wing defense  mostly   so give me paul george (if he doesnt count as superstar) who also gives me an extra ball handler which you never can have too much of   i would put klay Thompson but because of injuries i would go with middleto n. strong shooter and defender plus chemistry with giannis   and finally myles Turner, for defense mostly plus some  so-so spacing at the 5 like brook lopez does    myles Turner  giannis  middleton  George  curry   that team is fairly formidable with 4 great scorers, 3 great shooters(GOAT shooter included) plus a decent fourth shooter, and the best interior scorer   and the defense would be dominant"
"I’m going to try to also just include mainly role players.    C: Myles Turner  PF: Giannis  SF: KD  SG: Klay Thompson  PG: Jrue Holiday   Bench:  Reggie Jackson  Seth Curry  Matisse Thybulle  Robert Covington  Joe Ingles  Bobby Portis  Brook Lopez     Definitely could be better when some of the non All Star picks but without picking fringe All Stars, I like this team. Jrue was the toughest pick as I wasn’t sure if CP3, Trae, Booker among others were Superstars so I decided between Jrue and Lowry. Jrue I think fits better with a team like this personally."
"Starters:  steph (superstar)  klay (all-star)  og anunoby  giannis (superstar)  deandre ayton (all-star)  Bench: fred vanvleet, seth curry, caris levert, michael porter jr, aaron gordon, chris boucher, brook lopez   Good combination of offense, defense, play-making, and fit imo"
Brook and Robin Lopez are the biggest bros
"brook lopez plays like 30 minutes a game, we're really stretching the definition of a role player here"
"He could have and would have totally bounced to some other contender eventually, post-Lebron leaving Miami. Like, wouldn’t it have made so much sense if he eventually replaced Deandre Jordan on the Blake/cp3 clippers? Or maybe he’s the guy who would’ve eventually went to milwaukee, not Brook Lopez. We really got screwed. He was built for this modern style."
Can you name a big man role player who's been better than JaVale McGee for the past 5 years? Because I can't.  Edit: ok yeah Brook Lopez is a good answer
They need to find the right guy though.  Marc Gasol and Brook Lopez esque players.  Not a lot of those guys in the league.
"Not really changing form, but Brook Lopez made a 3pt shot a significant part of his arsenal late into his career. There are players that can do it, but it takes time and desire and Ben doesn't seem to have either."
"He's not wrong, but that's the kind of logic that keeps guys like Brook Lopez in the paint. If you work on something enough you can use it in a game."
"he’s good, he’s not all time elite   he defended 3.5 a game   Rudy was at 8.8   his own teammate Brook Lopez defended 7.3 a game, more than double what Giannis did  go look at the actual rim protectors, they’re all defending 7-10 a game   the volume is too little, and it’s because the rim protection he provides is when the big is in a pnr he can help and slide down for those possessions, but he’s not like a every possession plant him in the middle rim protector, and if you do use him like that, he’s not all time great, he’s damn good tho"
"Brook Lopez is a perfect example of why you keep practicing things you hardly use in the game. Further down the line, you and your team are gonna be glad you did."
Other than Brook and Robin Lopez
I had an argument with someone on the Bucks sub that would trade Brook Lopez for him if it were available lol. Brooks a better player on a cheaper contract.
"Jrue wasn’t great at scoring but he’s historically been good and is possibly the best on ball perimeter defender in the league. Plus, he was one of the best playmakers.  I think most teams contending would rather have Jrue than Westbrook. Brook Lopez is also better than all other bigs the Lakers have other than AD. Donte is back as well.  They also didn’t shoot well in the playoffs compared to their regular season. If they shot what they normally shot, they would be much more lethal offensively.  Lakers also have a fit issue right now and we’re not sure if they will end up clicking offensively or not."
The disrespect towards Brook Lopez lol
Uhh im taking brook lopez over KD 8 days of the week.
Before his feet went bad he could have been similar to Brook Lopez.
"But for the Nets it’s not even close. There’s two reasons why KD / Kai / Harden are so easily breaking Nets franchise records:  1.) They’re just that good, and; 2.) Historically, the Nets haven’t had that many good players.   Not trying to slander NBA champion Brook Lopez, but he’s basically the franchise’s leading scorer by default."
Brook Lopez ?
"Giannis, Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton and Paul George/Bradley Beal/Donovan Mitchell/Klay Thompson would be favorites there dude. They would have better shooting and defense pretty handily, and could play great zone with Giannis and Brook Lopez to force shots from the nets"
"That’s not really how it’s gonna play out. McCollum will be a huge defensive liability against the nets and will be hunted whenever he’s on the floor. It’s entirely possible brook Lopez gets played off the floor with the big 3. We didn’t really get to see it because harden was hurt but brookbwas really bad defensively in the first few games when kyrie was there.   I think teams will get a better idea this year that you will have to play small to match the nets otherwise you’ll literally get blown off the court. The nets have an underrated small ball lineup for defense because Durant can be serviceable. Then offensively they will just blow you off the planet if you’re playing traditional bigs.   They broke the point per possession record against Boston in the first round. It was a weak team for sure but it still shows the offensive firepower of this twam.   They had the highest offensive rating in league history last year with everyone missing serious time. This is probably the best offensive team ever, only comparable with the warriors and they have better offensive role players while those teams had better defense.   Cj mccollum isn’t nearly as big of a difference maker in a playoff series as you’re making him out to be. There’s a reason the nets are massive betting favorites even with injury concerns"
"Giannis, Jrue, Khris, Mccollum, Brook Lopez with Donte Divencenzo, Bobby Portis and Grayson Allen off the bench  Vs.  KD, Harden, Kyrie, Joe Harris, Patty Mills with Blake Griffin, Bruce Brown and Lemarcus Aldrige off the bench.  Bucks match pure talent and probably win team fit here too. Second option is much worse from Harden to Jrue but Middleton is pretty close to Kyrie because of his defense and how valuable shooting is rn, while the Bucks have a better bench and Mccollum absolutely blows Joe Harris away as a player."
"&gt;“That almost killed the team”   &gt;   &gt;Okay but it didn’t and he won a championship.   Brilliant analysis.  &gt;In a few years no one will give a shit about the injuries.  Naw, no one will forget the circumstances of this year when you bring up in arguments like this. We're all happy for Giannis &amp; the small market team winning and all in a vacuum, but when you use this ring to actively make arguments like these (or the posts comparing Giannis &amp; Shaq, Hakeem for example), the context will be brought up.  This isn't the 50s where people will forget what teams even played. In this modern era of basketball, and the world in general, everything is recorded.  &gt;When Donte went down, he adjusted.  Eh, not really, but then again he didn't have a ton of good options.   The problem with Bud was constantly playing Brook &amp; giving up countless wide open bucket to KD off of drop coverage. KD in that Game 5 scored damn near every point on a wide open shot. He also didn't pressure him or double him much at all, even when their 2nd best offensive options was either 1-legged Harden or cold Joe Harris.  There were more problems I've talked about before when the series was going on, but you get the picture.   &gt;When Giannis went down, he adjusted and won the ECF without Giannis.  I gave him credit for that when I mentioned he adjusted late in the ECF. Giannis going down allowed him to run more offensive sets with better flow, and allowed space for Lopez to eat down low.  &gt;Amazes me kids on here sitting on their ass with a phone in their hand call a player/coach in the NBA shit.  This is a common argument used in this context but it's such a pointless non sequitur that only a mouth breather would find profound. I can be an ass basketball player myself but still try to provide input with valid points to back it up; if I can't, what the fuck is the point of a subreddit called r/nba?"
"Top 10 maybe? Seems too slow to be a great defender. He doesn’t come across as a great athlete to be a run runner. He doesn’t have a jumpshot. Just seems like a player that doesn’t have much value in today’s game, but his scoring potential puts him above most of the leagues big men.  I’d definitely put Jokic, Embiid, Gobert, KAT, Bam, Ayton, Allen and Horford above him.   He’s probably in the Brook Lopez, Jusuf Nurkic, Clint Capela range."
"Agreed the issue with that point is though that before they broke out you still got a serviceable rotation player in Jerami Grant or Dragic, good role player in Hill and an all star center in Brook Lopez just without a 3pt shot. With Exum you're lucky if he can get on the floor at all and even then his career stats are 6/2/2 per game on 40% from the field and 30% from three.   Basically with your other examples you'd take a flyer on those guys because they're already serviceable, even if they dont improve at all they are still guys good enough to have on the bench or even start. With Exum its like taking a chance on Jimmer or Bennett, yeah there still is some very slim chance they break out but if they dont you're basically wasting a roster spot. I'd rather take a chance on a d-league guy than a guy from the 2014 draft."
Lol yea this is totally the same thing as brook lopez adding a 3 point shot
"And Brook Lopez added a 3 point shot in his 9th season..Jerami Grant had a breakout season at age 26. Considering his injury history he hasn't been able to really reach his potential but as he showed in the Olympics he has skill, so yes he can still reach some of his potential."
I find it hard to compare a guy in his 2nd going into his 3rd to a guy in his 4th going into his 5th year.  Tatum also has had the vastly better team and way better coaching. I think with Zion he's gonna need a 5 man alongside him like Brook Lopez
Harden&gt;Curry  Harden&gt;Giannis  Harden&gt;Kawhi  Jaesean Tate&gt;Anthony edwards  Brook Lopez &gt; Gobert
"Didn't help that y'all used him so poorly. It was like you looked at all the things Brook Lopez was good at, and was like yeah if you could not do those things that'd be great. Luke Walton does like to do that to players though."
Brook Lopez
"Aye aye aye. That’s in the NBA. The Warriors are trying to mold him into an Ayton type while shooting. Kinda what they had when Javale’s per 36 went nuts +Brook Lopez level shooting. We aren’t using hindsight we are viewing things from a 2020 NBA draft perspective. For Wiseman in college and high school it was all about trying to be an athletic stretch big. Ofc his shot does need development but again, we’re comparing him to 25% from 3 Lamelo. And a guard needs shooting WAY more than a big does. The intrigue with Wiseman is he’s a stretch big that can have traditional big size. Only thing that complicates that is his defensive lateral agility but on offense the guy can be the whole package. His ceiling is far more Embiid than Gobert who is nonexistent on offense and let’s be honest Wiseman probably never touches Gobert’s defensive impact. Wiseman will be a stretch big who can shoot 3s while being a superb dunker and hopefully a great rebounder."
What? Dude's getting $13M/yr now. He only got a min his first year on the Bucks IIRC. [https://www.spotrac.com/nba/milwaukee-bucks/brook-lopez-6136/](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/milwaukee-bucks/brook-lopez-6136/)
Thats why I was mad as fuck that we let Brook Lopez go for peanuts. HE WAS PERFECT
This was before Brook Lopez became a good defender.
Brook lopez
"Shaq won 3 FMVP with Kobe as his teammate. A 3peat. That’s basically impossible especially in this era. Re-watch Shaq in those Finals games. Whenever they needed a bucket Shaq delivered.   Giannis is only more efficient TS% wise cause of FT shooting. Shaq still beats Giannis almost every year in eFG%.   Shaq still averages more rebounds per game straight up. Shaqs career high in rebounds is 28. Giannis is only 21. Plus he plays with Brook Lopez, an infamously lazy rebounder.   Giannis obviously averages more assists since Shaq is a center. How many Centers average more than 6 assists aside from Jokic?   There was literally a game plan called Hack a Shaq so teams could slow him down. Teams today just slow Giannis down by letting him take bad midrange jump shots"
I mean Brook Lopez is a 33-36% 3PT shooter. It’s not like Simmons/Embiid still won’t clog the paint but yeah Simmons as a player is gonna be better than Middleton.
Brook lopez is just 2 Steph Currys in a trench coat
Brook Lopez’ awful 24 second violation this year in game 7 against Brooklyn. Happened directly before KD’s big toe on the line jumper.   Getting the W and the ship erased this from my consciousness until reading this question.
Brook Lopez in game 7 of the Nets/Bucks series—dude didn’t realize there was only a second left and passed off the ball after catching the inbound  It all worked out in the end for them though 🤷🏾‍♂️
This year has got to be Brook Lopez shot clock violation against the Hawks in ECF and Devin Booker intentionally fouling when he had 5 fouls in Game 4 of the Finals
Can shoot 3s too. Lakers never seem to utilize shooting bigs. Look at Brook Lopez.
"&gt;Myles Turner/Brook Lopez - 2 of the premier 3&amp;D 5’s in the league. Both are great interior defenders and 3 point shooters but also poor rebounders &gt;  Turner is only a great interior defender when guards are funneled into him  If he's against a back to the basket, post oriented offensive player, he gets eaten alive"
Thank you ! Brook Lopez is one of the best box out guys of all time. His numbers aren’t great for his size but his team rebounding numbers have always been stellar
Which is insane considering Jrue is like as perfect of a defender as you can imagine.   The bucks were the non-nets team i hoped would win (love Giannis and couldn’t be happier for Brook Lopez) but man was KD special that series
"Brook Lopez isn't a poor rebounder at all, he's just boxing out on every play, like his brother, like Steven Adams.  There's a reason why Giannis defensive rebounds numbers jumped so much once Brook joined the Bucks"
"But again that goes back to his point of only a handful of centers can do that, most never defend past the 3 point line. Brook Lopez never does that, and a underrated reason why the sixers lost to the hawks was embiid only played drop coverage which gave trae the ability to do floaters all game"
"I will always upvote a post about my birthday twins, Brook and/or Robin Lopez"
"&gt;I don’t see how you can ASSUME different skill sets in players we have DECADES of film on.  The entire point of this post is conjecture, hypothesizing, and assuming about a scenario that can't happen LMAO.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;If they had the skill set they would have used it to their advantage.  The whole point of development is to bring out a skill that is neglected or non-existent: ever heard of Brook Lopez?  The concept of development isn't a new one. It is not a stretch to believe that a player could reinvent themselves in a different era where a previously neglected skill has become more important.  All of that said, there are CERTAINLY players who would never become proficient in certain skillsets. I can't imagine Shaq burying 3s or Kareem handling the ball like Kyrie."
"&gt;Rarely guarded when he was by far the main defender lol. Look at the possession mins per game...  8.5 with Gobert waiting in the paint.    &gt;""The Jazz were far far better...""  &gt;Lmaooo. Ok I see you're just straight up a KD hater..   &gt;Don't think even Jazz and Mavs fans will say this shit but KD haters say this with their chest lol.  The Mavs &amp; Jazz were both historically great 3pt shooting teams, Kawhi &amp; his Clippers took it to a level beyond that.    What do you think would happen if you matched up a 30% 3pt shooting team like Milwaukee against the Mavs or Jazz?  The Mavs would do what they did to LA, throw Boban, KP (who Kawhi also guarded), Kleiber, WCS in the paint, pull out Brook Lopez and rain 3s.   The Jazz would pack the paint with Gobert &amp; do the same shit with Mitchell.."
Gobert gets played off the floor in the playoffs every year and Draymond has lost a step. Giannis has Brook Lopez at center helping him and AD is a better rim protector although they’re equally good at defending the perimeter.
"Kawhi played against Dallas &amp; #1 Utah, KD literally played like 4 games without his superstar &amp; still had an injured Harden, his performance is even more overrated than i realized.   Kawhi tore up this same Bucks team years ago on 1 leg while locking up Giannis, nobody is afraid of Brook Lopez or PJ Tucker lol."
"TBH, they definitely have failed putting themselves in a good spot to build around him.  Kinda low upside supporting cast, not much cap flexibility, still owe one future first I believe.  Still, they have Luka under contract for years, so they have plenty to time to try to get lucky and find some under-the-radar talent.  Bucks looked like they were in a pretty rough situation in terms of roster building and cap management three years ago and then managed to get Brook Lopez for cheap and added good role players.  KP acquisition seems like a pretty costly bust.  Even if he recovers a bit and starts playing better, the trade assets they gave up for him really could have been better served targeting a different player."
"2013-era Blake, Dwight, Paul Pierce, KD, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Tony Parker, Kawhi Leonard, LMA, Zeebo, Melo, Wade, Bosh, and Brook Lopez are all putting up big numbers in the 1980s. To suggest otherwise is a joke. Others like Garnett, Joe Johnson, and Steve Nash deserve on that list if you look at their entire body of work."
"Getting the bag is a huge thing, especially now that he's gotten a ring.  One thing that isn't talked about enough though is that they really don't have a replacement for an aging Brook Lopez. Granted his 3P% has gone down a lot in the few years so maybe the idea of him being a stretch-5 is better than him in actuality. But on the flip side, we've seen with the past 2 rings that you don't need to be a knockout shooting team to win it all."
"Do you think Giannis will re-sign with the Bucks again in 5 years? He's way younger than the rest of the roster, Middleton is 30, Jrue is 31, Brook Lopez is 33... And the Bucks traded a lot of picks to get Jrue Holiday and they aren't exactly a big FA destination.  Giannis seems to be the kind of guy that is loyal to a franchise, but at the same time Bucks probabily won't be good enough to contend in the last years of his prime."
If you put prime Brook Lopez on a time machine he'd probably dominate Wilt.
"Damian Lillard, Zach Lavine, Caris LeVert, Kawhi Leonard and Brook Lopez.  Edit: I didn’t read the post correct and they’re not in order"
"why is it so hard to believe that a guy drafted what, five years after the line was established, would be better at shooting in a world where almost every superstar, even at the center position, is knocking down threes?  If Jordan came into the league in ‘94 or even 2004, I don’t think anything really changes until he’s about to retire. But if MJ is born 30 years later and the only thing that’s different for him is the time in which he’s living, I think it’s reasonably safe to say he’d both shoot a lot more threes and would probably shoot a few percentage points higher. The way the game is *taught* is different now, from a super young age. If guys like DeMarcus Cousins, Marc Gasol, Brook Lopez and Nik Vucevic can go from banging in the post to threats beyond the arc makes me think that Jordan would have a good chance to develop as a good volume shooter from three, because nowadays that’s a glaring hole in someone’s game. When Michael Jordan played, who was belaboring him to shoot more threes? Where are all the people criticizing Magic and Isiah Thomas’ inability to make threes as a vital hole in their games? Nobody gave a shit about spacing, at least not anywhere near to the extent that they do now, during Jordan’s career. All of that being said, if he’s definitely taking tougher threes in this fake timeline, so I think it’s pretty silly to project him being like Klay Thompson or some shit. I could see his numbers looking kinda like Booker’s from three.   &gt;Why isn’t this retroactive projecting of skillsets done for other players as well?  that’s a really good question honestly, it’s just a fun thought exercise about how players skills are utilized and developed with the way the game is seen and played.   I think if Larry Bird came around today, he’d have even deeper range and would shoot over a dozen threes a game in some seasons, and the ball is in his hands even more. He’s probably a PF, but I could definitely see some Larry at the 5.   Dominique Wilkins is someone I wouldn’t see being an amazing shooter even in the modern game, but holy shit he’d shoot like 55% just by attacking the hell out of the rim with the spacing today.  Bring Kevin Garnett into the league 20 years after he actually debuted and I think I could believe anything. He’s another guy that in theory could expand his range because of his proficiency in the midrange, but this, as literally this entire thread is, is just speculation.   Finally, Charles Barkley would be a fucking god even with the exact same skillset. I mean shit, he actively shot threes in the 80’s and 90’s and was awful at them, and I just can’t imagine Chuck being different than he is now at any point in human history"
"But again, we're comparing Brook Lopez getting a bucket to one of the greatest scorers to ever touch a basketball moving his feet back half an inch.  Feel like we can be honest in acknowledging which one is more likely..."
Crazy if brook lopez wasn’t brain dead and pass the ball KD won’t have a chance. See we can play this game all day.
"Giannis Overrated  Since one of yo giannis fanboys want to delete my post I’m gonna repost it.  Giannis has no skill whatsoever  - He can’t dribble   - He can’t Shoot  - He has no IQ (decides to take a fadeaway on JAMES HARDEN)  -Overrated defense he’s regarded as an all nba 1st team defender yet was scared to guard kd and he has no permitter defense average at best he only has decent post defense   -He’s not clutch every time the game is on the line guess who gets the ball not Giannis MIDDLETON because giannis is not to trust in the clutch  Now let me get on with this overrated ring he got.  -the whole western conference was injured they played the worst team   -would of lost to the nets   -claims he doesn’t have a super team(great team) yet bucks beat hawks without him   - kd by himself took them to 7 games   - choked last year, only reason there doing so good this year is because injuries and the addition of jrue holiday was major to there success   - jrue holiday and Middleton don’t get enough credit the media acts as if giannis carried them, if giannis is not showing up Middleton drops 30 and they jrue holiday to lock up the other team guard like he did with booker  - all the times dropped over 35 he averages 17 free throw attempts   - he was dropping big numbers on one of the worst defensive team in the suns which is why against the heat he only averaged 24 against the heat  -he averages over than half the amount of the suns highest ft player with 85 attempts   -the idea over the casuals is that the bucks team wasn’t good and Giannis carried them they have jrue holiday, Middleton, brook lopez who saved them with the block on kd, and they got Bobby portis nowhere near a bad team actually a great team  -lost 2 games to a overrated suns team   - both his mvp he got were undeserved harden should of got it then Lebron   -Giannis also averaging the most free throw attempts in a series since Dwade in the 2006 FINALS.    Stop being bias and look at the facts when you put it into context you see how unimpressive it looks."
"But Embiid is still better inside and the focus of the offense.   If not a KAT then like a Brook Lopez, or I would even say like a warm body like Dwight if everyone else can shoot.   It’s just sooooo blazingly stupid to have him and Embiid pair up and to have your only solution be that Ben should magically transform into late career Jason Kidd when he’s obviously uncomfortable in that role. Should he work on those skills more and be willing to fail? Sure. But you’ve gotta have a Plan B, or friggin trade him before you hit a nightmare scenario like we’ve got"
The worst fucking thing to read is when people point to people like Brook Lopez’s improved 3 point shot to give hope for their players shit shooting improving at some point without realizing that Lopez was a damn good mid range shooter and free throw shooter to begin with. All he had to do was train to step back a few feet. It’s not that fucking easy though
Brook Lopez but Idk how this will go down if they have to retire Kyrie's Jersey
Same deal with Brook Lopez and the Nets
Straight up. You telling me Brook Lopez &amp; Blake Griffin can learn to be good 3 pt shooters Michael fucking Jordan can’t? It’s ridiculous
Their play styles are anything but modern except Boogie (who suffered two catastrophic injuries for a man his size). More “modern” centers such as Al Horford and Brook Lopez are still useful into their mid thirties
"&gt;1.	⁠KD has declined.   He just had a year as good or arguably better than the ones he had in Golden State.    &gt;He just plays a different  role as a PF now  He’s literally playing the same exact role he has for the rest of his entire career   &gt;who moves less so it's less noticed  Player movement tracking has him moving at the same rate he was at before injury.   &gt;but you see him unable to have that quick first step anymore as he struggled to blow by slow ass Brook Lopez.  This is just a flat out lie   &gt; He's just the most unique player ever so he can shoot over everyone  So he’s apparently declined, but still has the ability to shoot over anyone and get a bucket whenever he wants at the highest of levels? Make that make sense   &gt;2.	⁠Klay is not KD  He’s not, but he’s a perimeter based player whose game is based off skill not brute strength/ athleticism. His leg injuries aren’t going to hamper his game once he gets back into game shape.  &gt;has had worse injuries.   ACL injures don’t concern me at all. I’ve recently seen 2 athleticism based guards in Zach Lavine and Dejounte Murray both come back from a torn ACL and not only retain their previous athleticism but become even better basketball players afterwards. The Achilles injury is more worrisome than the ACL injury but just like KD, klay is a skill based player and perimeter player. His body isn’t going to get beat up like Boogie and Kobe’s did simply based on playstyle.   &gt;Klay is top 5 in miles traveled and plays a lot of tough defensive assignments  He’ll be load managed his first year so that won’t be a problem, and when talking about the defensive side this is the main reason they traded Dlo for Wiggins. Wiggins came into his own as a defender last season and more likely than not Dray and Wiggins will be the primary defenders.  &gt;I think GSW will be fine enough tho if they slide him to SF full time; 6'6"" is a good height for a SF and he fits better guarding those type of guys as he gets older nowadays anyway.  I don’t see them putting him at the 3 or guarding bigger more athletic 3s whatsoever I think doing so would increase his chance for another injury. They spent the last 2 years adding wings and forwards like Wiggins, Porter jr, Iggy, Kuminga and Moody for this very reason."
"Fun Fact: Brook Lopez is also #37 on all time blocks in a career. There are only 2 other current players that beat him out, Dwight Howard and Serge Ibaka."
"That’s an insane stat, I had to look it up to verify. Here’s the Net’s top ten:  — 1.	Brook Lopez	10444 2.	Buck Williams	10440 3.	Vince Carter	8834 4.	Richard Jefferson	8507 5.	Jason Kidd*	7373 6.	John Williamson	7202 7.	Julius Erving*	7104 8.	Kerry Kittles	7096 9.	Derrick Coleman	6930 10.	Chris Morris	6762 —  I would have expected Derrick Coleman to be much higher, and I’m surprised so many of the Kidd era Nets are there, especially Kerry Kittles."
"1. KD has declined. He just plays a different role as a PF now who moves less so it's less noticed, but you see him unable to have that quick first step anymore as he struggled to blow by slow ass Brook Lopez. He's just the most unique player ever so he can shoot over everyone 2. Klay is not KD, and has had worse injuries. Klay is top 5 in miles traveled and plays a lot of tough defensive assignments; a loss of athleticism will hurt him. I think GSW will be fine enough tho if they slide him to SF full time; 6'6"" is a good height for a SF and he fits better guarding those type of guys as he gets older nowadays anyway."
"Also Brook Lopez and the last good years of Deron Williams, and maybe Kenyon Martin?  Joe Johnson too but he's actually somewhat close to HOF"
Haha that brook lopez hug feast on butler is pretty funny. That legit could have given the heat the ball or foul shots but for some reason foul calls are entirely different the last minute of a game than they are every minute prior
"? The Bucks' best lineup had Giannis at center and Brook Lopez was getting cooked. Ofc Giannis is a big guy, but it's not like the Bucks were winning off their double big lineups or something."
"OKC is going for a 5-out system on offense. Having Favors is wrecking that right now, which is why they’ve looked much better with Muscala and JRE at the 5 and were much better last year with Horford. I would be very surprised if they went for someone like Capela. I think KAT would be their dream player, but they’d like someone in the Brook Lopez mold too (not actually Brook though, he’s too old)."
Brook Lopez. If we had a chance to get our Brookie Monster back we'd do it in a heartbeat.
Nets? Brook Lopez and Jarrett Allen.
"Brook Lopez, not so much dunking, but from being a restricted area guy to greatly increasing his range."
"I mean, if Brook Lopez went from a post player to a fucking sniper that late into his career, Barnes can too"
"It's called not having Jrue, Brook Lopez or Donte and it being an early regular season game."
"Bobby Portis and Semi Ojeleye are back tonight and will be playing; think that just leaves Brook Lopez, Jrue Holiday and Donte DiVincenzo on the injury list."
I thought Trading away Brook Lopez would be the end of the nets and in 2019 I thought we'd be sold of and rebranded
"All of his highlights are dunks, but he’s got a very soft touch around the rim and not a bad jumpshot. He’s a lot finesse-ier than looks and his rebounding can be really on and off. I like him as a bouncier Brook Lopez (before he became a legit stretch 5) or Valanciunas. Another one I like is Ayton. I don’t hate the Noah comparison either.  I was just commenting on the number of people just throwing out DeAndre Jordan just because they see the dunks."
Brook Lopez
If they focused on playing Myles Turner like Brook Lopez instead of sitting him on the block i feel like it would work better
Andre Drummond and Brook Lopez
Looks like a standard Brook Lopez screen
He did a similar thing to Brook Lopez in the playoffs last year with only a couple mins left in the game and actually got the call
Brook Lopez is the only one to come to mind.
Without Brook it has been harder to space the floor for Giannis. He's getting guarded by the other team's center the last couple games and will expect the same vs Indiana on Monday.   Speaks to how important Brook Lopez is to us
"I love how people think guys who dominated the 90s wouldn't have the skillsets to dominate today's league. Fuckin Brook Lopez went like 10 years attempting 6 3s total, to all of a sudden launching 6 *a game*. Same with Blake Griffin.  You guys are all crazy."
"He can't even post up properly because they put some burly wings (or guards, if you have a Marcus Smart) on him and he gets shoved off his spot before he can do anything  Dude should just embrace being a rich man's Splash Mountain Brook Lopez and fire away from 3, fuck the post up just spam the pick&amp;pop with Luka Doncic."
"&gt; MJ was ultra competitive and shot 3s at pretty much the same rate Giannis did last season. He played 15 seasons. He won't magically be shooting at 40%+ a la Curry from long range.  This is because of how the game was played then. Analytics wasn't really a thing and people didn't realize how much more valuable attempting threes was than attempting twos. In today's game, you have guys like Brook Lopez who went like eight seasons shooting almost no threes who now makes 34%. MJ would have worked his ass off and made 40%"
Brook Lopez on the Nets
"I just don't understand the Lakers.  LeBron + shooters is a proven formula.  Instead they seem hellbent on proving they can win without shooters.  To the point that they keep letting their guys walk for nothing (Brook Lopez, Caruso).  &amp;#x200B;  Which is even more insane when the era now is all about spacing.  It's like they're trying to zag when the league is zigging, but this really isn't the way to outsmart everyone."
Brook Lopez is allowing 14% at the rim greatest percentage of all time  You think it's too early? Nah that's goat shit and is sustainable in 82 games
Giannis and Brook are both great defenders but they’re different styles. Giannis isn’t great at rim protection the way Lopez is. The way our defense works is that Lopez can lurk while Giannis can come from the side if Bam drives. Without Lopez our rim protection is way worse.
"He cant be a superstar lol  He got fucking shutdown by Brook Lopez last years playoffs, he was pathetic"
Yeah but you also have to take into account that Lopez didn't play who absolutely bodied him with size last playoffs.  Much easier to attack Pat than Brook lol..
Brook Lopez: Spinal
"Ingram Randle Lonzo Hart would be great together right now, they were showing signs of that in 2018 season with Kuzma too. That small ball lineup was fun. Brook Lopez spacing the floor from the C position next to Nance and Randle was nice. I really thought PG would come and fill the leader role at the SG position instead of KCP and that team would be a contender in a year or two. Well having Davis and Lebron is also nice."
"That’s a solid % for a 7 footer. Better than Brook Lopez for example. Also he had to take a lot of tough threes on the Bulls when Boylen was in charge. And played through with a back injury during those years too. But I do agree he sucks at almost everything else except attacking closeouts, he plays some of the worst D in the league."
AD becomes Brook Lopez
"Crowder, PJ Tucker, Covington, Brook Lopez. All of these role player get really quality looks and still shoot with below-average efficiency. Crowder is probably the best out of the bunch but he's also the most volatile."
"Look, I enjoyed the win, but it's not very representative especially considering the absence of Brook Lopez. It's a lot easier to get to the rim when there's only one 7-footer instead of two. That's largely what gave our comparatively small team offense issues in the playoffs.  Sure the one-on-one stats are interesting, but they're ultimately irrelevant.  Hopefully we'll get a better view of how our teams match up during our next meeting in December."
Brook Lopez is the kind of millionaire I want to be.
They save that energy for cheering Brook Lopez.
PG: Stephen Curry (37)  SG: Klay Thompson (35)  SF: Lebron James (40)  PF: Draymond Green (35)  C: Brook Lopez (37)  Brook looks like the best C who will be old and washed just in time to join this super team.  Who would the bench be?
"To be fair Smart has a history of demolishing 7 footers. Embiid, prime Millsap, Brook Lopez and so on"
Bud turned a middling 7th seed in a contender in 1 off season. Yeah Brook Lopez helped but if Kidd was still the coach he'd have banned BroLo from shooting 3s
"To be fair, Brook Lopez owns the Heat."
"I don’t know what his problem is.  He’s obviously never going to play bully ball, but he should be able to develop a great face up and finesse turnaround game. Something like early-Dirk (not just because he’s white lol).  Dirk used his athleticism in transition and had a beautiful post game without playing bully ball. Granted he was a better ball handler than KP, but still.   These are the things he would do in NY, but now he’s a spot up player that sets bad screens. I’d rather have brook lopez"
"Not sure if Giannis is a center and Bucks already have Brook Lopez. If Kareem has ever played power forward, you can do that. Otherwise look to power forwards, Vin Baker, or Terry Cummings."
"Heat fans celebrating like they won the chip after beating the Bucks in a regular season game without Jrue Holiday, Brook Lopez, Donte, Bobby Portis, Semi, and Rodney Hood 😭😭"
"Imagine that team, plus Zubac, Caruso, KCP, and Brook Lopez. I'm sure some of those pieces were acquired for each other, put it's interesting to imagine a Lakers team that didn't pursue Lebron, AD or Westbrook. Does committing to the Baby Lakers fully give players like Lonzo, Ingram, Beyblade, and Dlo room to grow without fear of the axe?"
Brook Lopez maybe
"8 time all star could be inflated for Dwight though because center was still on the ballot back then. He only had to beat out, Brook Lopez maybe? Noah? Hibbert? The NBA changed voting to guards and forwards in 2013 because there weren't any all star centers lol.   He also has 8 (5 first team) all-nbas, which is more impressive, but again all-nba teams have a center slot. Look at the names he was beating out for it, it's not great. If all-nba was bigs and smalls instead like the all star team, how many does he get over Duncan, Dirk, KG and LeBron? Dirk only had 4 first teams! That's how crazy the forward competition was  But Dwight's peak with 3 straight DPOY is definitely up there in the conversation for top 75, even top 50"
"Brook Lopez weighs 282lbs at 7 feet.   Porzingis weighs 240lbs at 7’3”.       Using the square cube law, if you scaled Lopez’ proportions to KPs height to create a player with the same build, that player would weigh 313lbs.        KP is roughly 75lbs shy of being built like Brook. That’s the problem."
He needs to play more like brook lopez and know his role
"On the flip side that was also arguably the weakest era of centers, I mean who was his competition? An oft-injured Yao? Al Jefferson, Brook Lopez, Andrew Bogut?   With that said yeah Dwight got snubbed hard, dude was a defensive force in his prime."
Didn't most of those games ended in blowout ? jimmy wasn't the only problem Bam getting lock up by Brook Lopez hurted a lot too
"Ah I guess the only bucks fans left are the delusional ones.. But you’re right, if brook Lopez was not hurt you guys would be the one up by 30 ;)  You guys were SPOOKY against half of the nets also."
"Miami double giannis, bucks miss wide open 3. Miami make 3s and no brook lopez means weak paint protection."
Hiding from brook lopez
Holiday &amp; Brook Lopez &amp; Donte DiVincenzo
Bucks looking shitty without jrue and the real bucks mvp brook lopez
Maybe Brook Lopez even
"Below are some of the players who are gone now, but were on the Laker’s roster the year before LeBron joined them, and during his first season with the team -    Lonzo Ball    De’Andre Hunter  **Was drafted by Lakers but shipped off in the AD trade.    Ivica Zubac    Thomas Bryant    Brandon Ingram    Kyle Kuzma    Josh Hart    Alex Caruso    KCP    Larry Nance    Julius Randle    Reggie Bullock    Jordan Clarkson    Brook Lopez    LeBron James   I wouldn't mind seeing this team in action."
"I'm sure he does. He is just the worst shooter in the league, by far. This will never going to change and people knew before he was drafted and knew before he was maxed. That's like asking Brook Lopez to develop a good handle."
"Yeah Draymond was a bit of a stretch but he plays some time at center so I threw him in, but he’s definitely needed to defend smaller players. Another comment said Bam and he could play that defensive role too if Draymond didn’t count. Another shooter could be either Vucevic or Brook Lopez, I’d probably take them both over Okynyk."
"Brook Lopez shot how many threes before he went to the Bucks? If you don't practice it, you don't do it. He has a shooting stroke.  Let Booker run the half court offense."
"Yeah I still have hope for Bol tbh. Dude looks good, just needs either the opportunity from the Nuggets or another team that'll let him loose.   I don't think he'll ever be a superstar like I thought he was gonna be, but he could definitely be a great role playing starter like a Brook Lopez or an overqualified 6th man who could be a leading scorer on a tanking team."
"1) They are as good as they are because they got fresh starts elsewhere and new roles where they could succeed.   2) You are talking about NBA 2K kind of fantasy rn, I was talking more realistic terms. Realistically this core was never going to stay together, even less so be as successful as they have been individually if they did somehow stay together. It would be a fun team to watch, it could even be borderline playoff team, if we followed realistic timeline. If we just took this players 2K style and inserted them all on a team together today, I could see them maybe being even the 6th seed if they get lucky and other teams have injuries etc.     Extra reading for a ""realistic timeline"" explanation, long ass essay for anyone that wants to waste their time:   Magic traded DLO already thinking he would get PG or some other star and he really liked ZO. So already with no Lebron on the team, Magic still gives up DLO for nothing but expiring Brook Lopez essentially. Randle wanted to leave in FA because he wasnt going to play in the same old role, so he could maybe stay if he gets guaranteed starter role and bigger role. Rest Lakers traded to make salaries work or for more fitting role players. If they are to keep everyone, I THINK their roster could look like that in 17/18 season..     Starters:   Lonzo/KCP, DLO, Ingram, Randle, Zubac/or some other minimum level big   Bench:   Clarkson, Hart, Kuzma, Nance, Mykhailiuk, Caruso, T. Bryant, Andre Ingram, Luol Deng     Luke Walton would have hard time trying to keep everyone happy, Randle and DLO would be 1 and 2 options most likely, Clarkson good 6th man off the bench. Ingram growth would be hindered, Zo could possibly be coming off the bench, Kuzma will also have even more of a reduced role. Caruso never becomes a thing. Luol Deng still sits on the bench and gets paid 12m for another 2 seasons. IRL they finished 11th with a record of 35-47 largely the same core as in this fantasy. Maybe with DLO who has his break a little earlier, they can finish with a few more wins and be above .500 42-40, well thats the record Clippers had that season who basically were in similar situation and that record gave them the 10th spot. If they still manage to keep this team together for another season, they would need at least 48 wins to be the 8th seed, which Clippers had IRL with similar roster kind of. By now the FO and fans would have been waiting since 2013 when the Lakers last got swept in first round, to no playoffs for half a decade, to now be able to lose (possibly get swept) again in the first round to the still healthy Warriors superteam. Next season Warriors lose KD, AD is FA and wants out, Kawhi is FA, perhaps so is Lebron who extended his stay in Cleveland before etc. I'd highly doubt Lakers would be able to still keep this team together after this point."
"''You're that guy, Mozgov, trust me, you are.''  Especially in celebrations though, the Lebron Raptors baseline perfect connection and Larry Nance Jr assassination of Brook Lopez with Mozgov in it celebrating after made them 100x better.  He pulled a TNT CWebb with Charles' jokes."
"Well, he makes a serious impact against everyone except Milwaukee (because of Giannis).   Last night, he primarily defended Khris Middleton, which isn’t new. He defends wings well. His impact was negated by Brook Lopez playing the drop game magnificently, and by Milwaukee being a meh matchup for him defensively"
Great move...now they can trade him with another one of the Laker/bucks first to get Brook Lopez who they can then sign to a 20m/2yr extension next off-season...smh
"Zion is easier to scheme against if the center can cheat. If he's playing with a shooter, they can't.  If Brook Lopez sat in the paint, he would hurt Giannis. He doesn't. He shoots from the perimeter quite a bit. Giannis would put up numbers regardless.  It's really not that complicated. Westbrook can put up numbers but in playoff situations, you can scheme against him.  Zion isn't playing playoff defenses who are ready for him in the regular season."
It’s been an issue since his Houston days. He tried to counter with the floater but that’s not going to be a solution with Brook Lopez lurking
Brook Lopez helped a ton in this regard too. Lopez brothers box out probably better than anyone in the nba.
He's like Amish Brook Lopez
The idea of Brook Lopez and Myles Turner is way better than Brook Lopez and Myles Turner lmao
TIL r/nba has a hard on for brook Lopez. Go figure
without looking at the box score im going to guess Brook Lopez has 15 blocks
Brook Lopez is such a bitch man couldn't be my center
[This](https://gfycat.com/goldenflatirishdraughthorse-brook-bucks-lopez-clap)
"Yeah go small ball against a team that has Brook Lopez and Giannis in the paint, and see how that works out for you.  Brook “leading Nets all-time scorer” Lopez"
Put Brook Lopez back in….I need my points
Brook Lopez needs to retire for getting blocked by patty mills
"i appreciate that they showed Brook Lopez getting his ring, over anyone else lmao(seriously)"
Robin Lopez was probably at home watching the first Paddington while Brook got his ring lmao.
Brook Lopez still a bitch
First three of the season goes to Brook Lopez
"It's not even a matter of takes and knowledge on the theme at all, just straight up basketball and evident facts and events.  One doesn't have to wonder on what is more playing basketball, more legit competition etc but especially straight up available game and whole between a certain number of guys competing in an even play field between Curry and CP3 cooking, Lebron and KD going crazy in 2017, Kawhi, Lowry, FVV, Gasol battling the Sixers and Bucks, Lebron's career high 51 and 8 8 vs the Warriors' all-time defense, Dame's run, all-time Harden Rockets going insane, 2018 Lebron vomiting number one all-time basketball for two months on one side.  And on the other side the Kevin Huerter-led crippled Hawks getting burnt down by 2021 Brook Lopez while the first option of your favourite NBA runner up is out nursing an injury (this is your NBA Eastern Conference Finals material), the Suns vs the Clippers with Kawhi Leonard having been murdered off camera or something, Harden freakishly getting injured to his leg stepping down on the court seconds into the series and the Suns and Lakers literally upping each other on the series based on who was injured or got suddenly back in again, instead of their back and forth on the court with their abilities, and looking like 5 versions of themselves in one 6 game series.  &amp;#x200B;  The highlight of the post season was Ben Simmons passing the layup, the various guys comically forgetting how to play basketball and a guy dropping 50 strolling back from an injury on up and coming young role players collapsing unto themselves when finding themselves shot up straight to the Finals while 36 years old CP3 was on an island getting chased and mauled by the opposing defense.  Which is funny considering the narrative of those locked and loaded 2018 best-version-of-themselves-Celtics (to this day even) with young stars and veteran basketball elites, and that team actually proving, winning and playing like a best team in the league with Tatum and Brown tearing it up especially, being just ''illegitimate, all rookies, 7 Games of nothing, like the Warriors vs the Lebron Cavs''."
Brook Lopez got a ring
"And that led to them slumping out of the playoffs against a team without their best player, because Gobert couldn’t score against 6’8 guys and the team wasn’t good enough playing defense against Reggie Jackson and Terrence Mann while Gobert was forced to stand in a corner. Like I said there’s a cap on your teams success. Paying Gobert 40 million means Mitchell has to ascend to a top 5 player to compensate. Whereas when you use your maxes on players who can give you production (Giannis&amp;Middleton/ Bron&amp;AD/ Steph&amp;KD/ Harden&amp;CP3) you can have Kevon Looney or Brook Lopez or Clint Capela at center and be a better more dangerous team."
"It's totally normal to change the way you play. Even Chris Bosh had to change from primarily post up to being a stretch big when playing for Miami. Brook Lopez proved that he's still great in the post in the hawks series, even if they are asking him to only shoot 3s for the bucks"
Really Brook Lopez save the season putting up 33 in that first game when he was gone
"And he got super exposed in the finals last year, couldn’t stop Giannis inside and couldn’t stop brook Lopez from shooting, he has no stretch ability."
??? Idk how you can say that when players like brook lopez exist. NBA players don't just wake up one day fully formed.  It's a constant process.  The fact that he shoots incredibly well from midrange and well from the line means he could add a killer high post game and/or 3 pt shot as well.  He has a very high ceiling based on what he's shown so far.
&gt;big bucks  You think giannis gets brook Lopez to join in?
"The meat grinder has been laid down by a series of invisible gnomes shooting (that's the only way you can explain all those freak injuries) NBA superstars, second options, third options and starters of both conferences, almost every time a new Playoffs day arose.  Yeah, an injury he managed to eat up and play like it was nothing (man, it truly is nice to be Giannis, Harden's words has been proved even more truer by this title, and poor the players with the style of Kyrie), but you forgot how it happened comfortably against the Kevin Huerter Hawks (your 2021 ECF finalist, and people dare talking about the Raptors and 2015 Warriors), the continuous asterisks and lack of adversity are literally comical.  Imagine any first option of the game in Playoffs history or, I don't know, Lebron getting injured against the PG Pacers or the Celtics after already having Bosh down (Giannis already had not a single starter or co-star down) lol no more coasting to the title, no Khris, Jrue and Brook Lopez putting down your opponent. If it happened vs the Nets and the Bucks won things would already have looked a little different.  It's not just me who is calling Harden an iron man, Harden was blatantly an iron man to the NBA world with his track record and it was one of the main thing he was known for, before 2021 and his completely random freak injury seconds into the series."
"I mean, your point?     The Nets not being legitimate doesn't make the Bucks (favourite and stacked almost as much btw, nobody can stop your big 3 besides the Nets, especially when the competition is the only one imploding with freak injuries; they were and are favourite even vs the 36 and 37 Lebron Lakers) your ring against teams suddenly shot by injuries right in their Playoffs run and turning into lottery teams fighting for their lives (2021 Brook Lopez was enough to put down one of them)."
"If the 2022 Playoffs explode with injuries as well (or to begin with Kyrie doesn't play, or someone on the glass cannon Lakers goes down in some capacity), not for long. He'll need to wait for the 2010s stars to retire.  If Jrue, Khris and Brook Lopez keep clutching and defeating teams on their own like that though the asterisks are sure to keep coming though."
I know damn well you didn’t call Brook Lopez or Porzingis better than Ayton. Sabonis and Vucevic are terrible defenders and Sabonis and Wood and Giannis are PFs.
"Because despite what the blog boys might tell you, quality big men who can stay on the floor in playoff games and play decent perimeter defense can't be acquired for cheap every year. There is an exponential difference from picking up Javale McGee for the veteran minimum and a playoff closing center like Ayton. Even quality big men like Brook Lopez was played off the floor in the finals this year."
Am I the only one who thinks the crazy part is that it was brook lopez and not the ppg?
"Brook lopez was playing amazing defense against heat, nets, and went off against the hawks. What are you about. Your heavily overrating Ayton. He’s not worth max money."
"He’s not significantly better than guys like Steven adams, brook lopez, etc…."
Brook Lopez on Robin Lopez: “We are twins. We’re just different colors.”
I can’t believe I always forget about the clutch Brook lopez block on KD
"JJJ is 6‘11, 240lbs and is a pretty good rim protector. He is also only in his 3rd year, I‘m pretty confident that if he played more at Center he would get better over time. His rebounding is pretty weak, but Brook Lopez isnt that good of a rebounder either and Bam wasnt incredible at the beginning either"
Nets points scoring leader Brook Lopez
"I know you aren’t literally asking but thought it would be fun to think about, Brook Lopez used to be able to have a night like that but I doubt it now, Giannis could do it if he has one of those nights where he he is hot from 3. Jokic isn’t a big block type of rim protector but maybe he could get up to 5 blks since he is always in the paint. Serge Ibaka if he can ever return to 2019-2020 form. Bubble Anthony Davis could do it but he can just make his jump shots this year. Finally have a feeling Mobley might have a night like that this year even.   If anyone else can think of more love to know."
I don't agree. I think Cousins Matches brook as far as 3 pointers and Is much faster.  If he can get some 30+ minute games we will know for sure. I think even now he's much more athletic than Lopez and would be a better help on defense and offence. But we'll see sure enough.
"you realize Lopez is like.. an all-defense caliber big, right? boogie is way way worse than Brook on defense, and offense too these days unfortunately"
"I would be be happy for him if he won tho. Carmelo, Westbrook and Butler too. I was  happy when Dwight Howard and Brook Lopez eventually got their rings. Cousins was a great player and I enjoyed watching him on Kings and Pelicans with AD before the injury.    So many greats ended their careers without reaching the summit despite all they did for the game like Barkley, Malone, Ewing, McGrady, Carter, Wilkins among many others. Ring chasing is not that bad."
Trading D’Angelo for Brook Lopez and then not re-signing Brook Lopez    Trading Danny Green for Schroeder     Zubac for Muscala
"Who in this case beating Bulls or Heat?   If we're still just on the Bulls I actually don't buy the Heat. Even with Tyler Herro having made something of a massive leap (or maybe he's just started really hot? We shall see). I just dont think they can defend the Bucks. They're still tiny. I realize everyone loves Bam but he is just not in the same universe as guys like Giannis and Jokic and when he has to deal with those guys (and Brook Lopez in the Bucks case), it's just too much. The Heat are clearly better than last year,  but I don't think they're in the same class as the Bucks/Nets. I think Chicago could have a good shot against them as well. With homecourt I'd probably even lean toward Chicago."
Wonder if this means Brook Lopez is gonna be out for a long time
"I would take Lopez in the 2nd unit over Gasol. Gasol had some good moments for them but Brook is more consistent and better able to punish bench units as a scorer, Brook was also a better defender in 2019 and since than Gasol is (Gasol has the better defensive career though)."
Brook Lopez vibe
Do we call this a Brook Lopez? Or did some other big change up his shooting so drastically before him?
"Brook Lopez has been Splash Mountain for a while, but Valanciunas earns stealing that nickname if he keeps this up, damn dude"
"""Elite defense"" that was giving him wide open 3s that he bricked. The Bucks are really not elite at defending the 3. Look at Jeff Green's game 5, that's what usually happens when you keep Brook Lopez on the floor vs a jump shooting team that doesn't care about getting to the rim."
Brook Lopez says hi!  Seriously though he went from attempting 31 and making 3 in his first 8 seasons combined to 134/387 in his 9th. Not saying your comment is incorrect in any way it just made me think of the most insane example of somebody flipping the switch like that.
That’s already taken. Ian Eagle coined that for Brook Lopez
The Brook Lopez special
"He's always had this just didn't shoot that much, he shot well once for the Raptors like 40% in small sample size and stopped  His FT%, mid range % have always been great, this is like a Brook Lopez where it's just centers that can shoot should actually shoot now"
He's going Brook Lopez mode (Zion is Giannis in this analogy)
"Bucks have been missing 2 key players all year in Brook and Donte. Even so, the trio of Giannis/Jrue/Khris is 9-0 and on the same pace as the Warriors and Suns are right now.    Once Lopez is back our defense elevates to a top-2/3 level and we’ll have a bench led by Portis/Connaughton/Divincenzo. That’s an insanely deep roster even if Boogie contributes absolutely nothing"
Brook Lopez. Signed for 3 million and then got 50 mil
Brook Lopez did not play with LeBron. Signed with the bucks for 4mil in the offseason LeBron joined.
Brook Lopez only season as a Laker was before LeBron came
"He played with George Hill and Brook Lopez,"
Like my boy Brook mf’n Lopez
Is there a timetable for brook lopez
What is this? A Brook Lopez for ants? He needs to be at least three times taller!
Curry is playing at a different level compared to the last 3 years. One of the biggest surprises is how well his teammates are doing.   KD is at the top of the East and even James harden has struggled this year. Lebron consistently took poor teams late into the playoffs.   Giannis took Brook Lopez to the championship.   I’m not doubting Curry can put up numbers on a bad team. I’m talking about wins.
"&gt;No one would be able to keep Iverson out of the paint and he was an incredible finisher. I don’t think he would be shooting nearly as many 20 footers though  Bigs are *a lot* more mobile than they used to be and help defence and defensive schemes have gotten a lot more intense.  That's not to say that AI isn't AI or anything like that, just that videos of guards abusing Rasho might not translate quite the same way against Brook Lopez."
"Bucks are 4th in the East rn and have won 8 of their last 10, and still don’t have Brook Lopez back"
That's crazy. They still got prime Brook Lopez though
Brook Lopez was a terrible defender before he went to the bucks
He just needs Brook Lopez
What no brook lopez does to a mf
"One of the most important players to the team != deserving of a max  Brook Lopez is one of the most important players on the Bucks. And he doesn't deserve the max. He absolutely isn't as good as Ayton is currently, but I'm just saying that just because a player is important to a team doesn't mean the team should pay the player ~40 million per year. Why? Because it means the team would have to sacrifice a ton of players just to get Ayton back if they signed him on a max."
"How do you not see that for that assumption to stand, for YOUR assumption to stand that you’re essentially comparing the 2 different teams of Bulls and Bucks as equals?  The Bulls this year and the Bucks last year are not equal. The Bucks had far better Playoffs experiences, between the battles tested multi Playoffs years of Giannis, Middleton, Holiday, Brook Lopez and PJ Tucker..  The Bulls lack that compares to Bucks and Heat.. do you see how stupid your assumption is?"
"It’s about accumulation of Playoffs experience you bozo. Finals or not, it’s about the body of work of battle tested in Playoffs. Lowry, Butler, Tucker, Spolestra been thru way more than the likes of Derozan, Lavine, Lonzo, Caruso and Billy Donovan.. that’s my point  Also don’t even bring the Bucks into this. They have multiple All Star caliber players and they have a multiple MVP. Can’t fucking compare last year Bucks to this year Bulls.  Giannis himself gone thru multiple years of Playoffs before he breaks thru and so did Middleton and Holiday and Brook Lopez and they had PJ Tucker, Zach Lavine has never even sniffed the Playoffs yet, same with Lonzo, Vucevic had a handful of Playoffs series maybe 2? Or 3? DeMar a choker. Can’t compare that"
Ironic considering Andris Biedrins seems exactly the same “player” to bandwagon Warriors fans as you’re saying Brook Lopez is to bandwagon Nets fans. Either him or Monta Ellis are the players the new Warriors fans quickly look up and mention to “prove” they’re long time fans.  This mf even put the accent on the “s” 😂 you definitely looked up “pre-Curry Warriors” and copy pasted the dude’s name to pretend you’re not a bandwagon
"I think the question should be: Could you build a championship team with prime LeBron + 4 versions of players that averaged less than 10 PPG in that season. Because people are picking players who've averaged less than 10PPG for their career but choosing a version of that player who averaged more. Kinda defeats the purpose.  An early 2000's ""grind it out"" type team would do well. But I don't think you can in 2021. But add 2-3 more players (e.g. Bucks era Brook Lopez + Shane Battier + another guard) and you're in business against almost any matchup."
"Something I also don't see mentioned about Dwight is how bad his competition was at the center position. It's not his fault, but the NBA quite literally changed the rules of all star voting so people could vote for 3 forwards instead of 2 forwards and Dwight lol.  It's unfair to him in a way because you can only compete against who's in your era. But for example someone racking up all-nbas and all stars as a forward was going against KD, LeBron, Dirk, kg, Duncan. Centers had Dwight, then... Tyson Chandler, brook Lopez and those couple of years Noah was good. Maybe Amar'e for a few years? I think even Pau was listed as a forward back then"
"I think outside fans might be surprised by how often Bucks fans will suggest trading or benching Brook Lopez. All the numbers suggest he’s still an elite player in many ways and, frankly, a bit of a unicorn. There are very few legit 3-and-D centers."
"Brook Lopez and Brooklyn.   all class never really complained  even with all the losing and was a joy to have here. the only time i heard people here curse him out  have been when he was on the bucks  and that was more  of a fuck giannis thing than a brook thing.  only the fan tho got here post brook or  bandwagons hated on him.    man deserves to have his  jersey retired.   i just wish the  franchise let him keep that number rather than let kyrie have it.... ( and before people say its cause its kyrie, i feel the same way about Joe Johnson and  KD sharing  the # 7)"
Oh god haha I have no idea what I was thinking. How the hell I transposed Brook Lopez into Blake I cannot explain...
They retired. No longer have that crown. I don’t think Robin and Brook Lopez Is there
"AD, Porzingis, and several other guys mentioned by other comments are also stretch 5s.  You don’t even have to have a stretch 5 or an all-star at the 5 though. Miami made the finals 2 seasons ago with Bam, Phoenix made it last season with Ayton, Milwaukee made it with Brook Lopez. Golden State made it for years with a bunch of non-shooting centers and Draymond. Lopez is the only one there that shoots 3s well, but he’s also just a role player and not a star. All-star 5s that can shoot are great, but it’s not really a necessity if you have shooting at the other positions."
"Most teams need a Brook Lopez lol, shot blocking, rebounds, and shooting in 1 big man is still pretty rare"
"Nahh, they need a Brook Lopez type, who provides rim protection, boxes out on rebounds, shoots enough from the outside to not demand the space that Shiddey wants to get into and is able to finish all those nice little passes under the basket.  After that, they need shooting - but everyone needs shooting, right ?"
"&gt; **Brook Lopez:** [...] Two of my teammates, Jordan Nwora and Giannis’s brother Thanasis [Antetokounmpo], are huge into manga. Giannis enjoys it, too, but Thanasis is … my goodness. He might be the biggest manga/anime fan I’ve met in the NBA. On plane rides he’s always watching different animes. He always comes to games with different hoodies or tees with manga characters on them. So he loves it. He’d be all about contributing.  How long until we see Thanasis wearing ahegao hoodie as his pregame fit?"
Robin Lopez. Lol jk. I don’t think Brook is going anywhere the next 2-3 years.
I'd easily take MJ. The Snake hella overrated cause he got to play 1 on 1 with Brook Lopez lol
I just looked up his stats and his jump in 3pt shooting was wild!  First 2 years of his career - no 3pt line  First 9 years of having the 3 shot - 10% shooting on 7.5 attempts ***per season***  Last 3 years of his career - 35.6% shooting on 2.4 attempts ***per game*** (183 attempts a season)  This man was truly the Brook Lopez of his time
"You are right, I forgot that wasn't what I thought. I thought Giannis didn't deserve it because he had Brook Lopez on the team as well, whereas Gobert was a singular defensive anchor. The DPOY is my least issue, he's a great defender."
There’s a lot wrong with this but that brook lopez is a better defender than giannis is completely rslurred
I agree with most but not that Brook Lopez was better at defense. He finished 10th in voting?
"Giannis legacy has benefitted greatly from luck and favorable media coverage. First MVP was driven by medias disdain for Harden, got one of his DPOY when Brook Lopez was clearly better, was losing basically every series in his championship run until an important opposing piece got hurt and they came back, and he wasn't even playing when his team got him to the finals. Then he actually has a good finals, and everyone gives him insane praise when injuries were clearly the MVP of the Bucks finals run."

Nah just Brook Lopez and Vuc off the top of my head
"Yeah I understand your point but I think we are at the point where we know Giannis will be good at whatever role he plays on the team ( except a spot up shooter from the corner 😄) the problem is even with a healthy brook Lopez and donte ,the bench is not NBA caliber for the most part . And there isn't a guy that can play small ball 4 next giannis at the 5 like Pg tucker . The closing lineup always had brook Lopez out because he gets targeted, now Bobby Portis gets targeted as well."
He's pulling a Brook Lopez.
The Brook Lopez evolution track
Naw the bucks will be picking him back up in December when he’s eligible to be traded. I hope anyways. No clue what’s going on with brook. We need Lopez bad.
Bucks hitting their stride as they have had most of their rotation back (Brook Lopez and Donte Divincenzo aside).
"&gt;location makes an impact but it’s not the only thing that matters  Yep, it just happens that superteams are never formed in Memphis. It's a coincidence, they didn't make the right moves I guess. Oh look, the Clippers also got 2 stars. Another ""good moves"" franchise.   &gt;It sounds like the root of your hatred stems from Milwaukee being a very undesirable location for free agents, which is understandable.  Honestly, I don't care about that right now. I mean we got a ring, it's all good even if Giannis leaves. My issue right now is that NYC and LA fans in here try to tell me they'd do just fine if they were playing in Indiana or Denver.   That's some ridiculous shit that I'm sure you repeat in your subreddits but like, don't say that stuff here. Imagine telling an OKC fan how your FO, picks, drafts etc. is the reason you got 3 superstars. You got 2 of them for free and the 3rd one forced a trade there.  But y'all insist on talking about Allen and Dinwiddie lmao like they're the reason you have a superteam rn. Reminds me of the Lakers signing LeBron and AD forcing a trade there. ""Amazing moves by our FO, we got LeBron and AD!"" Weird how we didn't get AD or LeBron either. Was a close call, LeBron almost signed with Milwaukee. Well we did get Brook Lopez though, because thankfully the Lakers didn't wanna offer him 4m/year to re-sign him.  Tell me about LeVert though. How did you turn that into Kyrie and KD???"
Ikr I did not expect JV to go full Brook Lopez
"No, not instantly, but fast enough. Faster than Milwaukee for example, that hasn't signed a better FA than Brook Lopez in like 6 decades. I forgot, you made better moves, that must be it. Not the fact Kyrie and KD wanted to play for a team in NYC where they can do the fuck they want lmao. Because KD wouldn't have come to the Nets if Dinwiddie hadn't won that game vs the Sixers in the playoffs, YEP."
"And all that wouldn't be possible if you were the Memphis Nets, yeah? Because I can name 10 better FOs right fucking now that don't even have 1 superstar, let alone 3.  You really telling me how you managed to turn LeVert into Harden? **The only reason Harden came is cuz he forced a trade to the Nets to get carried by KD,** stop talking out your ass. Try supporting a team whose biggest FA ever is ""washed"" Brook Lopez that nobody else wants and Greg Monroe and you might be able to see the difference."
"You're literally repeating my words and you actually think you're making a point. I think I don't need to repeat that the Knicks were THE JOKE OF THIS SUB and have a terrible owner, probably the worst in the league. I said that before you, read above.  Oh okay, so KD went to the Nets **because they have a good owner**? Or because **they play in New York and their owner is not a piece of shit**? You know it's the latter, you don't need to reply. So it's pretty simple. No New York, no superteam. Imagine actually arguing against someone saying there's absolutely no chance you'd have a superteam as the Milwaukee Nets.  **Source**: the biggest FA we have ever signed is Brook Lopez (because nobody in the league wanted him even for less than 10m/year - (btw that's your all-time leading scorer, what a franchise!) and Greg Monroe. I guess we couldn't build such a good brand, the Nets have been dominating the league and their owner likes puppies and everyone wants to play for them. Get a grip and FOH."
"Nah there’s plenty of big men that can shoot. KAT is the obvious one. Then you could throw in Brook Lopez, Vuc, Jokic, even Embiid maybe"
"In all seriousness he’s got a really good chance of cracking the top 10 by the time his two year extension runs out. Brook Lopez is currently 10th and only took three years to get there, we only have 8 guys in the entire history of the franchise with more threes in their Bucks career than Steph got in 2016.  Our history is… not fantastic."
"You can imagine Klay, KAT, Kawhi, Brook Lopez, etc being great with Simmons. But you certainly do need to be careful building that team."
To this day I don't understand how Brook Lopez never had a 40 point game in his career (career high 39)
brook lopez.
Bam would be played as a PF if Miami had a brook Lopez type of player to cover up for his shooting struggles. He thrives because yes he is faster than traditional C's but that lack of size could easily be exploited come playoff time. He couldn't back down Giannis and Brook because he was so undersized and Miami collapsed.  What I'm describing sounds more like a PF played up a position no?
No steph is just a better off ball defender hence why he led the nba in steals one year and his stature and intensity makes him a liability on pnr.   You can't teach defense... most defenders are born super athletic or aren't the main scoring option and put more effort on that end. You know-&gt; mj and then guys like Tony Allen.   Brook Lopez went from a post scorer to catch n shoot. Lonzo % went up and up each year.  You can aquire a jumpshot.   You said 3 season he shot above 35%. Also nobody said he was amazing. Just a better then demar.
"I’m not going to go through the list one by one, but a lot of these names are either 1) very debatable or 2) make no sense to even be considered (there is no way the 76er trade list has centers)  I get it, people are clowning Simmons, but he is one of the best defensive players in the league and finished second in defensive player of the year last year, and besides for one playoff series collapse, he is a high impact player with way above average passing and athleticism. People are in here acting like a Ben Simmons for brook lopez trade would be fair."
Love brook lopez tho
"There was the shoe size thing, but if Brook Lopez has the situational awareness to put up a shot and at least draw iron on the previous possession, KD never gets that shot. Lots of fluky things happened in the last few minutes of that game"
Add Brook Lopez to that and I would watch religiously.
"Zach lowe has /r/nba worm brains than if he thinks westbrook is the most important player. Their most important player is out, why is everyone pretending Lebron is healthy and playing? If giannis wasnt playing on the bucks everyone would excuse their losses. Hell they excuse their losses because fucking Brook Lopez is not playing."
"We are the best team in the NBA !  That said, both sides are affected by illness and injury. Late news has indicated Bucks center Brook Lopez is 'Unavailable, in a queue at Disneyland'."
only added Brook Lopez 😭😭
No one was saying that about Brook Lopez dude. And jokic feasted on us.
My point that brook Lopez is best at drop coverage that will be exploited against elite teams in the crunch and playoffs. He can't play a switching defense. The bucks elite defensive lineup was switching with Giannis at the 5 and Pg tucker at the 4 . The opponent was running double screens to get the shooter on pat.
Brook Lopez is a liability against quick guards that why he wasn't closing for the bucks last year . Giannis is too bulky and can't get around screens . No amount of basketball iq is going to change that
Brook Lopez
Giannis doesn’t have the defensive BBIQ like Draymond has. The league would be broken if they were together.  The warriors would absolutely be god tier on defense if they had Brook Lopez
"He was certainly a bad coach with us, if he does well on the Mavs I hope that doesn’t erase that he was terrible here. His defensive schemes were among the worst and even with all the talent we had in his later years here, we couldn’t even finish higher than 7th in the East. Once we got rid of him the first year and replaced him with a good coach we immediately improved while adding only Brook Lopez and only a couple bench pieces."
Counterpoint: the bucks most Skilled player is brook Lopez
The Bucks best player is Brook Lopez
"Your explanation for why he wouldn't be as good defensively was about mobility though  U said modern bigs have to be able to guard the perimeter. Is Orlando Shaq really gonna do that much worse than a Brook Lopez? Marc Gasol? Javale Mcgee? Tristan Thompson etc ?   &gt;In terms of pure mobility, there are countless other starting Cs in today's game that are far more mobile than Shaq.  Than Orlando Shaq? Absolutely not. Like I said...he was more mobile than 90% of the bigs today. Idk why u guys have it in ur head that all the bigs today move like Giannis. Literally...all the best centers pretty much suck at guarding the perimeter and are slow outside of Bam. Hell Jokic just won the damn MVP and he's as slow as they get."
"No. I don't think they do cause DPOY Draymond singlehandedly won't carry that terrible Jazz defense to a further extent than Gobert. Defense requires a team to be effective. It isn't like offense where a singular player can carry an entire offense, such as Trae Young with the Hawks in 2019-20. You thinking that simply swapping Gobert for Draymond would solve the issues with the Jazz defense when the issue is not Gobert but his teammates is showing you have no clue what you're talking about.  Also, answer my question. Would you argue that 2017-18 Giannis was not a versatile defender because his team was shit on defense, not because Giannis was bad on D but because his teammates were and the coaching staff employed a scheme that was ineffective and relied on him too heavily? Or do you think that them improving to #1 in DRTG the next season when they got Brook Lopez to man the middle, Coach Bud to do Coach Bud defense things and drop players like Jabari Parker was solely because Giannis went from mortal man to god on defense in a singular off-season."
"&gt; Compare that to a guy like Ben Wallace - when he joined the Bulls, they were among the worst defence in the league. With only his addition they became the #1 defence, and Ben led them to the conference finals with the only good defender next to him being 21 year old Deng (not better than Royce O neal).  You are straight-up **lying** my guy. The Bulls in 2005-06 (the season before they got Ben Wallace) were 7th in DRTG. That is literally an elite defense. They were a trash offensive team (23rd in ORTG) but were an elite defensive team. Getting Big Ben took them from 7th in DRTG (103.4) to 1st in DRTG (99.6). They also only improved 8 wins, going from 41-41 to 49-33. And they didn't make the conference finals, they lost 2-4 to the Pistons in the second round. The season before, they lost 2-4 to the Heat in the first round.  &gt; Shit place any DPOY in the past 7 years - Draymond, Giannis, Kawhi - and they wouldn’t be fazed by shitty teammates. Gobert’s just not a versatile defender and not a great example.  2017-18, the Bucks were 19th in DRTG. Not because Giannis wasn't doing Giannis things on defense. But because he had Jason Kidd as the head coach and a team that didn't have as strong a defensive roster as in 2018-19 where they got Coach Bud as well as acquire Brook Lopez to be the starting centre instead of John Henson. Hmmm, it's almost like even with a DPOY caliber defender on the team, the Bucks were still shit on defense because the coaching staff had a bad system that overly relied on said DPOY caliber defender being a DPOY caliber defender and a roster that played defensive ""anchors"" (as in they sunk your defence) such as Henson (starting centre) and Jabari Parker. Would you argue that in 2017-18 that Giannis was not a versatile defender and not a great example because the team sucked on defense in spite of him being so great on that end?"
Brook Lopez 2.0
"It's honestly could be a great discussion.  If I were an NBA GM and I had a super athletic PG, I'd let them do this too. You don't even need Russ-level athleticism. Dallas does this with Luka and Lonzo/Brook Lopez did some of this in LA.  Russ grabbing a defensive rebound has somewhat of the same effect as Giannis grabbing a defensive rebound. Both guys are going coast to coast."
"dwight was the best center at arguably the weakest time in NBA history for the center position. The only other legitimately great center in the NBA during Dwights best years was Yao who was dealing with injuries every year (and Yao owned dwight in their matchups, because dwight had absolutely no offensive game outside of being stronger and more athletic than everyone). When Brook Lopez and Marc Gasol are two of the other top 5 centers in the league during your prime, it shows how weak the big man was back then.  Compared to his all time peers he was unimpressive (including jokic and embiid). He was an impactful defender with a shit offensive game who had the perfect team built around him to minimize his glaring weaknesses and he still only got to the finals because the Celtics had injuries and the East was weak as fuck outside of them."
"We were also on some D'Lo copium for a while. Don't think it was a bad pick considering the other top options but bleh. That trade ended up being D'Lo for Brook Lopez, Kuzma, and dumping Mozgov. I'd still easily take that trade. Wouldn't be a super contender, but a team of Lonzo+3&amp;D SG+BI+Randle+Lopez w/ Kuzma and Hart off the bench is a solid team."
No Brook Lopez to space the floor and take a big out to the 3 point line. They also miss him defensively for his rim protection.
"Dumb move, should have held on to Caruso. I think Pelinka has done a good job overall, but the list of players we've given up for nothing could make a pretty good squad...Randle, Brook Lopez, D'Lo, Caruso, Thomas Bryant, Gary Payton II, Dennis Schroeder, and David Nwaba. You gotta get SOMETHING for those assets. Not to mention the Westbrook trade, which has a chance to be Pelinka's Mozgov/Deng signing...the one move that unwinds years of otherwise solid work. I do like THT though, 3/$30M was a good deal."
"From the eye test and without even looking at your comparisons to other players, he has a ceiling of a Garnett career, and a floor of Brook Lopez career"
"KD is a good defender but he doesn't impact team defense overall. Without Giannis, the Bucks defense is the worse in the league statistically, and with him they are ninth, and that's without Brook Lopez and Divincenzo, two very good team defenders who would easily bump their defense up a few spots if they were playing."
"It's Bobby Portis *technically* but we all know he's a PF. They have a spare roster spot so hopefully can target someone later in the season if Lopez' injury persists. You should have seen the games where Bobby Portis *and* Brook Lopez were injured, though."
They’ve been missing half the players that normally make their defense good.   It’s probably fair to be worried about what’s going on with Brook Lopez but they should be a lot better once Middleton comes back.
Lmao you think Brook Lopez is a better defender than Simmons?  Go to bed nephew.
“Hitch’s” real name? Brook Lopez
"yeah I saw that when I googled to see which one she dated in college, I actually thought it was Brook.  EDIT: Here's one of SI articles about them in [college](https://www.si.com/more-sports/2008/03/24/lopez-twins)."
Random crazy game here last year. Milwaukee was up like 12 with 2 min left and blew the lead. OKC tied it with 30 seconds left and Brook Lopez had to hit a game winning 3 to put it away.
"Here's a ranking of the officiating in the four major sports in the U.S. (ranked best to worst).  #1 Major League Baseball. By and large the calls a right and replay has reinforced this. There is very little subjectivity in the interpretation of the rules. Aside from the occasional home plate umpire that is cross-eyed, the game play is usually evenly called for both teams.  #2 National Football League. Only this high on the list because the next two leagues are so terrible. Half the calls are made arbitrarily and too many rules are open to interpretation. The officiating sucks.  #3 National Basketball Association. Probably the most difficult sport to officiate, and they don't make it any better with star treatment. Giannis can run headlong through five defenders and will get a call when he hits the floor. Brook Lopez, you could behead him on the court and there would be no call made. The NBA deserves to be at the bottom this list but for the next league...  #4 The National Hockey League. At least they do a good job of accurately call offsides. Other than that, every call is completely arbitrary. Holding, hooking, slashing, roughing, etc. occur about every four seconds, but is called at random. As a spectator sport hockey has so much to offer, but it's hard to get behind a game when the outcomes are so determined by the calls made instead of the skill of the players in the game.  Honorable mention, Major League Soccer. This league would be at the top of the list if more people watched and if it could be considered amongst the majors. Though no officiating is perfect, the MLS, and futbol in general, do a pretty good job at officiating."
Lmao you think Brook Lopez is a better defender than Gobert?  Go to bed nephew.
"It's definitely hard to say bc they are being asked to do very different roles. And in the current NBA, rim protection is more valuable/more feasible than perimeter play because even if you can prevent a guy from getting his shot off from like a step back, or if you cut him off his drive, there's still probably 3 guys floating outside who would be happy to catch and shoot. However, this skill is invaluable if you do want to get the ball out of the hands of star scorers and make their team do the work, or force them into uncomfortable situations if they are not much of a playmaker. Simmons also benefits a lot from having a premier Center defensive anchor, allowing him to freestyle his role a bit more. But it is undeniable that a guy his size who can move as fast as he can isn't hugely impactful.   I feel like it does often make sense to split defensive rankings into like a forward/guard split, where you could rank Simmons amongst guys like Jrue, Smart, Kawhi, Dort. Because when discussing impact, it's so hard to tell.   And another thing, guys who are mainly rim protectors are going to have their role vastly hurt by teams that don't play into the strategy, especially if they don't have the right personnel to stop outside threats. We've seen Gobert get burned trying to guard perimeter guys before, but look at the Bucks cracking to the Heat. IIRC the Buck's style allowed guys to penetrate since they had such good interior defense, but what if a team is loaded with shooting threats + dynamic playmakers in Dragic and Jimmy? They're going to occupy the defensive anchors and allow guys outside to burn the team. In a series like that, a guy like Simmons could be hugely impactful, more impactful than Lopez for sure. That's why I think them picking up Jrue is going to solve a lot of their problems on the perimeter.   So yeah hard to judge impact when each situation/matchup is unique. I think if teams were assembling teams based on defensive ability people would be taking Simmons over Issac, Robinson, Capela, and Brook IMO."
When did the Wizards get Brook Lopez? And wtf happened to the Celtics today?
Brook Lopez
Brook Lopez took 0 threes in his first 5 seasons now he takes about 5 a game at 34%
Brook Lopez looks trash every time I tune into the Bucks.
"Nope. They’re incredibly shallow, Brook Lopez is looking like he’s taken a step back, and Antetokounmpo is still a shit shooter whose weaknesses will be exploited in the playoffs once again."
Brook Lopez. To slow to put on the floor against top tier teams.
Possibly yes: Brook Lopez for Joe Harris  Possibly no: Jrue Holiday for Mike Conley
Wow brook lopez is second worst???
Brook Lopez over Giannis LMAO. more blocks does not mean better..... Brook is one of the reasons our defense is ass. He's too slow on the perimeter and gets cooked by guards. A great shot blocker and pain protector but not switchable at all.
Brook Lopez isos seem to be Buds favorite play these days.
Brook Lopez is washed
bucks should not start brook lopez I will die on this hill
The broadcast said he tied Brook Lopez. Are Lauri and Dirk really 7 feet
"He’s more of a Brook Lopez rebounder in that he focuses more on boxing his guy out than getting the board. He got burned quite a few times this season not boxing out and his man getting the offensive board. So he’s working more on finding his man and letting someone else get the board. Plus, he runs out a lot on the break so that reduces his boards."
Brook fucking Lopez got more shots attempts than Giannis and Middletton ...  This fucking coach man..
Like they need to get Middleton hot instead of giving up after Giannis can’t get it going and letting Brook Lopez post up Gobert
We've actually got Brook Lopez taking more shots that Giannis and Middleton combined lmao
"I know they're missing Jrue, but the Bucks offense is so ugly when Giannis isn't taking over. They just posted up Brook Lopez against Rudy Gobert with Giannis and Middleton both on the floor. What's the point?"
I think Quin will let Brook Lopez shoot corner 3s all night if it means Giannis is putting up 2 FGAs a quarter
I think they said 8 by Brook Lopez. Zinger is tied with him.
TIL Brook Lopez is 7 ft+
"Really interesting how certain picks have huge bumps in value when compared to neighboring picks. 7th, 9th, 10th, 13th, 18th, 21st, 23rd, 24th. 7th was no surprise to me given Steph (even though the chart's from 2014), but also has guys like Luol Deng, Eric Gordon, Rip Hamilton, Chris Mullin. 9th is loaded with Dirk, Amar'e, Shawn Marion, DeMar, Iggy, Kemba. 10th has Paul Pierce, Paul George, Joe Johnson, CJ McCollum, Brook Lopez. 13th already looks good recently given Herro and Booker, but also has Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine and of course Kobe. Good spot to draft a SG I guess.  18th, 21st, 23rd, and 24th seem a bit random. 18th has above-average role players/1-time All-Stars with BJ Armstrong, David West, JR Smith, Eric Bledsoe. 21st has Michael Finley and Rajon Rondo, and I like Brandon Clarke and Tyrese Maxey from recent classes. 23rd is represented mostly by Tayshaun Prince. 24th has Kyle Lowry, Andrei Kirilenko, Serge Ibaka, and Derek Fisher.  I wonder if there's actually added value to holding these specific picks in that they are often the beneficiary of teams above them passing on certain types of talent. The ones towards the end of the 1st could also benefit from being typically selected by the league's better teams, meaning those picks go into higher-functioning organizations that are able to properly support their draft picks, and also likely have specific holes for their 1st round pick to fill in a mostly constructed roster.  It's also possibly that there's simply not enough compiled league data to truly draw conclusions about any of these outliers. They could possibly all fall back to the mean given like 50 more years of the NBA."
Brook Lopez   He was terrible the first few seasons but kept improving little by little to the point where he was All-Defense last season.
Is Brook lopez elite scoring and efficency for a big man ? wtf
"In fairness Dwight's competition at center during his prime was andrew bynum and brook lopez, melo had to compete with lebron and kd"
We’ll give them former All Star Brook Lopez for Robinson and every first they’ve got. Options!
The refs called it on behalf of Brook Lopez.
"it helps having Giannis and Brook Lopez there to save the blowbys. its not his fault he's bad, it's not a lack of effort, he's just not athletic. can turn into a flamethrower sometimes tho"
"I think the idea is that players like Drummond get their rebounds through height and athleticism, which is fantastic for individual stats. However, on possessions where he doesn’t get a rebound, he plays lazy D and doesn’t box out. Meanwhile, players like Brook Lopez and Steven Adams box out every possession, and won’t even jump for a rebound if their teammates have got it. When Lopez was on the Lakers, his rebounding numbers were abnormally low, but when he was on the floor, you saw a huge spike in his teammate’s rebound numbers. Point is: there’s more ways to impact the glass than catching the rebound."
"**2004:** Dwight Howard, Andre Iguodala.  **2005:** Chris Paul, Lou Williams.  **2006:** LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, JJ Redick, Rajon Rondo, PJ Tucker, Paul Millsap.  **2007:** Kevin Durant, Al Horford, Mike Conley, Jeff Green, Thad Young, Jared Dudley, Marc Gasol.  **2008:** Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, Danilo Gallinari, Eric Gordon, DJ Augustin, Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez, JaVale McGee, Serge Ibaka, Nicolas Batum, George Hill, DeAndre Jordan, Goran Dragic.   2009 with James Harden and Steph Curry is probably the end point?"
lol ain’t nobody scared of Brook Lopez
plus Embiid or Brook Lopez if they make it out of the East
"Well it depends on the matchup but nowadays centers spend a lot of time outside the paint on defense so they box out more to other players instead of going for the rebound, which is why players like Antetokounmpo or Doncic put up such rebound numbers. A lot of teams use their bigs either from the high post or the perimeter to create space on the paint for either drives or cuts to the basket. The biggest example of this being Brook Lopez, a friggin seven footer who hasn't grabbed 10 rebounds in a game in what it feels like forever. Now pretty much only traditional centers like JV, Vucevic, Gobert, Drummond or Capela are top rebounders, as for Adams he's spent his whole career boxing out for Westbrook so I think it has become just a part of his game by default"
Grant Hill just mentioned that he played against Brook Lopez and I checked bballref and he really did. Blew my mind for some reason. I forget how old Lopez is and how long Grant played
brook Lopez never thinks he fouled but that was a trash call
"You think Alex Caruso is better than Brook Lopez? That is absurd, and the only way you can justify that is with the classic cop-out of yOu DoN’t WaTcH. LMAO."
&gt;Guys like Brook Lopez or Royce O’Neal are on Caruso’s level or better and they aren’t nearly as popular.  You could've just said I don't watch Lakers games. Why embarrass yourself with that?
Lol he’s a good role player and that’s it. Guys like Brook Lopez or Royce O’Neal are on Caruso’s level or better and they aren’t nearly as popular.
"Brook Lopez is both.   People credit him for the wrong thing; he was a great defender last year but as we switch around schemes he’s left in the dust and you have to wonder what else he can do on defense with glue sticks for legs. I don’t think it’s fair to call him an all defensive player. He’s not playing all nba defense right now.  However he is a great shooting big man, he was in a slump last season after just the season before setting the record for most threes in a season by a 7-footer, so people thought it might’ve been a fluke season, but he seems to be back this season and provides amazing spacing in our froncourt with Portis"
Brook Lopez leads the league in contests??
"how many of these guys would you start Deandre Jordan over?  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Clint Capela  Nikola Vucevic  Christian Wood  Jarrett Allen  Karl-Anthony Towns  Montrezl Harrell  Rudy Gobert  Enes Kanter  Kristaps Porzingis  Bam Adebayo  Jonas Valanciunas  Richaun Holmes  Deandre Ayton  Steven Adams  Jakob Poeltl  Daniel Theis  Al Horford  Brook Lopez  Serge Ibaka  Mason Plumlee  Myles Turner  Wendell Carter Jr.  Moritz Wagner  James Wiseman  Cody Zeller  Nerlens Noel  Aron Baynes  I count 6 ***at most***.  That's if your low on Wiseman, and I would probably take Wendell Carter Jr. over him."
This man just said Brandon Ingram for brook lopez 😂😂😂
Brook Lopez   Reason: everything about him
&gt; Is he worth keeping or should they deal him to let Zion run the show as point forward?  I don't necessarily agree but open to the premise  &gt; I feel like Pelicans will be better off trading Ingram to the Bucks for Brook Lopez  Lmfao you lost me
hahaha. brook lopez for one of the better young players in the league. i wouldnt even trade him for middleton and 2 firsts.
"lmfao   turn brandon ingram into brook lopez, perfect"
For brook lopez lol
&gt;to the Bucks for Brook Lopez  My eyes
"Do you want me to go to the future and see how the Bucks perform this year? Lmao. You don’t get the point here. KG never had a caliber of a teammate like Khris Middleton who is in his prime while KG’s best teammates in Minnesota were past their primes Sprewell and Cassell.  Tell me who are you gonna compare Brogdon with? Sebastian Telfair? Heck even George Hill was pretty good and KG never even had a teammate like that besides the three players I mentioned.   Giannis had Brook Lopez, Brogdon, George Hill, Mirotic, etc. Who did KG had? Trenton Hassell?"
If in the playoffs Anthony Davis was playing 5 feet off Westbrook every poss letting him shoot then brook Lopez and his concrete feet shouldn’t be in the same zip code as RW on that switch
The bucks should probably be looking hard at trades for brook lopez. Having him drop as the defensive just doesn't work anymore and he is only getting slower
"This is literally what we did with Russ/Adams and Russ got all the shit for it.  Then Brook Lopez started doing it for Lonzo. Then he started doing it for Giannis.  At some point, I fully expect more teams to adopt this. I've been saying this for years now."
As good as he is he’s very limited. He’s bad against low post bigs and isn’t a great rebounder. He’s basically a young but slightly worse version of what brook Lopez is now
"If Giannis is the center, what is Brook Lopez when thye play together?"
"Nah, then whats Brook Lopez / Marc Gasol? They can play both but naturally imo are PF’s"
"Teams can't get away with having two slow bigs on the floor on defense because they get abused on switches, and on offense it's hard to play with two non-shooters.   ""Traditional"" power forwards can succeed at the 4 if these weaknesses are accounted for. Giannis is great at defending perimeter players, and on offense they have Brook Lopez to space the floor. Sabonis has spacing around him for days. Dudes like Julius Randle, Lauri Markkanen, and Dario Saric are knockdown shooters and good enough ball handlers so they fit well into modern offenses.  The PF position isn't dead, but those who can't shoot and/or defend the perimeter just get run off the court in the playoffs."
"Everything, including poster dunks, is slow mo when it's in the hands of Brook Lopez (but they still work)"
Anyone else remember when Brook Lopez was a fairly elite rim protector
"I am a simple man, I see brook lopez, i upvote"
How is Brook Lopez confused about that call?
"I miss this man. I was a huge fan.   He could catch any alley oop thrown his way, it seemed like he had a 10ft wingspan. Loved the inside oops from Pau/Lamar to him. Kobe would go for a jumper, spot him open, and lob it up with the fake shot.  At the time he had the best touch inside for a big man, and I believed he was the best all around offensive big in the league (along with Brook Lopez and AlJeff iirc).  Luv u Bynum"
"It’s gotta be hard as hell after a lifetime of playing in the post, but it kept Brook Lopez a starter."
bereave it or not some guys would rather just stay even if they are becoming free agents. when the lakers had brook Lopez he said don't trade me. he wanted to finish the season out.
"It's like when the Nets traded Thaddeus Young, brook Lopez and Bogdonavic at the start of their rebuild. 3 good players but getting old and not a great fit anymore."
"size matters some for sure, but maybe not as much as we would think. players like myles turner and brook lopez def don't get even close to as many rebounds as they should with their size. and then some players like josh hart and westbrook outrebound players their size by an outrageous margin. obviously westbrook may be an outlier with how hard he goes for rebounds, but my point stands. you can be a great or terrible rebounder regardless of your size"
Splash Mountain aka Brook Lopez
I would love this man in Denver. He looks like Jason Mamoa and he's the type of player who affects games without the stats. Same with Brook Lopez
"They're struggling too much with Tristan fucking Thompson to make me believe they'll do anything against Brook Lopez, let alone Embiid."
"Yeah we'll see about that. If OUR broken ass team can take a game off of you, good fucking luck with the Bucks and Sixers.  Bout to be exposed by Brook fucking Lopez"
"These dudes dumb as shit. Nets defense is legitimately suspect as fuck and the Sixers have got the personnel to exploit areas of major weakness.  Celtics without their 2nd best player taking a game off the Nets despite incredible performances by KD and Harden should be an obvious indicator to anyone.  Meanwhile the Bucks just curbstomped the Heat and are looking like a total buzzsaw. I'd take Bucks over Sixers and Nets, and if I'm the Sixers I'd like my chances having my best player matched up against Deandre Jordan/ Blake Griffin than a front court of Brook Lopez &amp; Giannis."
Brook Lopez? He was all defense 2nd Team last season
"Jimmy was terrific all year. The Heat just weren’t a good team, and that let the Bucks focus a ton of defensive attention on Butler, because they knew the rest of the team wouldn’t kill them.   Last year’s Heat team had the 7th best net rating in the league headed into the bubble. That put them in fringe contender status.  This year’s Heat team had the 16th best net rating at -0.2. They just weren’t a good team, for a number of reasons, and last year’s team was actually really good, both before and in the bubble.  Jimmy’s playmaking, rebounding, and defense were all there against the Bucks. His scoring was disappointing but makes sense within context of the series. Giannis was his primary defender, if he shook Giannis, it was Jrue or Middleton switching into him, and if he shook any of those 3 defenders, once he got in the paint he was being met by Brook Lopez.   The playoffs are all about hunting mismatches, and Jimmy basically got hit by great defense at all points he was in the game. This was one of those series where Bam and Dragic needed to take over, and once that happened things could open back up for Butler, but none of that happened. Really well designed defensive gameplan from Bud this series."
"Which surprised no Heat fan to be honest. Did you see our rotations and starting line up most of the season?  Also Spo is an amazing coach…but constantly going with a starting front court of a scrawny 6’8” Trevor ariza and 6’9” Bam vs 6’11” Giannis and 7’1” Brook Lopez was weird considering we at least had 2 (not great but serviceable) big men in Dedmon and bjelica  But if you thought we were making any noice with our current roster and situation, you’re tripping."
"Well, they do have Daniel Gafford, but everyone else is just BBQ chicken. It'll be interesting to see how Jo will deal with bigger bodies. Brook Lopez and Giannis are a formidable duo to try and deal with him."
"Capela, Brook Lopez, Embiid, Gobert, AD, Poeltl, Turner, Giannis if you count him, Noel, Bam to an extent. There are many great rim protectors"

Not even that inconceivable honestly. They have a big three of their own and Brook Lopez will absolutely give them trouble as Milwaukee’s fourth or fifth option.
Would you rather have  Brook with Kyrie handles  Or  Kyrie with the goofiness of both lopez brothers combined
Who guards Durant? Who guards Harden? Kyrie? Joe Harris?   The Nets will happily let you post up Brook Lopez every game if y’all want
"Yea pretty sure everyone else is seeing you’re dumb af. The original topic was how the Nets would guard brook Lopez and you couldn’t even give a semi intelligent answer, just a snide remark that had nothing to do with it."
Important to note: the last two times they played (which was only a couple weeks ago and the bucks won with no harden) brook scored 8 pts and 4 pts while being out scored by Blake Griffin. I once again state: the nets are not even thinking about Lopez
"I 100% agree. This series will be a lot of fun. I just think when the nets make a game plan for next series, fear of brook Lopez doesn’t even make their top 5 concerns."
Brook lopez is cooler than the current nets team by a lot
"You’re right. The nets are petrified of the 33 year old center who averaged 13ppg in the season and playoffs this year. That’s gonna change the trajectory of the series. Whatever will Harden, KD and Kyrie do about brook lopez. All those rings brook has and that first ballot HOF career is gonna terrify them. Yikes my man."
"Not sure that matters. Literally every matchup in every series is a nightmare for Blake. But Blake can play on the outside and Brook will have to chase him around. Also, who cares? Who on the Bucks can stop Harden? I would say Harden can disrupt the series a WHOLE lot more than Lopez"
"I don't really care how the OP phrased it, it's a reddit comment. Brook has been here for three seasons now and Embiid struggles against him, and the series will have Lopez playing, thus Embiid 'historically struggling against Lopez' applies. Not really sure what you're trying to argue, are you saying his stats with Lopez not active is important to this series?"
well Brook Lopez is on the Bucks and he's our starting center
You said against the bucks not against Brook Lopez.
And 39.2% shooting when Brook lopez is active  39/31/79 splits
This Bucks team is scary when Brook Lopez is the leading scorer and Giannis is leading assist guy in a playoff game.  4 guys with 20+ points too.
"*Finally, the last minute of the game*, thought Jimmy Butler as he received a quick inbound from his trusty big, Bam Adebayo. *This is where I excel.*      Jimmy dribbled down the court and glanced around at the mass of Heat fans cheering his name. He smirked and reached towards a small sack tied around his waist by a simple string. He dug his hand into the plump pouch and grab a hand full of its contents.      *South Beach sand.* He takes it everywhere he goes. Jimmy, while dribbling, brought the sand to his nose and wafed the smell. Ah yes! That smell! He could sense the gulf shore breeze in each granule. It was the perfect smell to remind him of his destiny, to be one with Heat culture. He dreamt of this moment.       He ritualistically blew the sand out of his palm and all over the NBA court; the crowd went **wild**. Jimmy then began squaring up his defender, Giannis Antetokounmpo from the Milwaukee Bucks. Giannis was a large man, that was certainly the case, but Giannis lacked one critical factor.      *Tyler Herro.* Jimmy quickened his moves. Right, left, right, left. Giannis had no chance. Butler approached the 3-point line and whipped the ball over to Herro, ready at the corner for the 3.       Routine catch-and-shoot from one of the bubble’s biggest breakout stars, Herro collected the pass with style and immediately jumped for the release. He flicked his iced wrist; tiny South Beach sand grains sprinkled out from underneath his fingernails.      *An S-tier release*, noticed Jimmy Butler. He gazed as the ball achieved a beautiful arc over the Bucks’ defense. Jimmy turned and began his shift to defense. *Herro had too much drip to miss--*      Clank!      Jimmy spun around to see that the ball had smacked the front of the rim and was hurtling toward him. He nabbed the ball, eyeing the shot clock. 14 seconds. They were down by 1. He squared up Giannis again. The sand he had previously blown onto the court was now crunching underneath his shoes. *Down to the wire*.   Sure, It was surprising to see that Herro had missed, but it didn’t matter anyway. The Heat just needed to bring Jimmy to the playoffs. They needn’t worry. He’ll handle the rest.      He darted towards the basket, worming his way around Giannis. Bucks’ center Brook Lopez slid into the lane. Jimmy juked outside, spun, and jumped. A mid-range attempt.      *I’m stupidly locked in.*      \[Game Ended. Milwaukee Bucks Defeat Miami Heat 4-0 in series sweep\]"
I can't figure out a series MVP - my shortlist is like five players but one of them is Brook Lopez.
If u watched the game giannis played great he struggled to make shots but defensively he played great but man brook Lopez had an amazing game today
Can we just take a moment to recognize how well Brook Lopez played this series? In the playoffs having a tradition center is still a big plus. Think he hit maybe two 3's all series or so.
Brook Lopez took 0 threes and scored so well regardless
Brook Lopez just could not miss. Completely dominated Miami down the stretch.
How does brook lopez have this many points
The Miami Heat lost an elimination game to Brook Lopez. I'm dying rn.
Brook Lopez &gt; Bimmy Jutler
u just lost to new jersey brook lopez
Future disney world hall of fame brook lopez
Nets all time leading scorer Brook Lopez?
"The Bucks have a great defense to handle Jimmy, and Brook Lopez pitching a tent in the paint. Context matters. Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, Giannis, PJ Tucker, Donte Divicenzo, and Brook committing a defensive 3 seconds every possessions will kill any star without a 3pt shot."
"If this was my first time watching the heat, I would think they didn't have a center the way they are getting out rebounded and Brook Lopez dominating."
Count how long brook Lopez stays in the paint without having bam adebayo within arms reach   Hint:  it’s more than 3 seconds
Meanwhile brook lopez hooks players down low every rebound and then winks at the referee 😏
I don't think I've seen Brook Lopez behind the 3 pt arc this game. Jimmy looking irrelevant.
Brook Lopez should set up a tent the way he is camping the paint on defense
Brook Lopez commits a defensive 3 second violation literally every single possession and people wonder why Miami is shooting poorly in the paint this series
other names include Brook Lopez but not limited to Giannis
"Why doesn't Brook Lopez, the largest of the players, simply eat the others?"
"Certainly not refs, refs don't care about Brook Lopez camping in the paint for 7 seconds either"
How much is Brook Lopez allowed to get away with lmao
"Yeah they should, just like they should call illegal screens on lopez, giannis and also 3 second defensive violation on brook lopez almost every other possession."
[What Bam sees when he looks at Brook Lopez](https://cdn.getyourguide.com/img/location/5457947b8a235.jpeg/92.jpg)
Brook lopez playing like the best player on the court
"I’ve never seen Brook Lopez so hype. This dude is absolutely dismantling Bam, who honestly before this series I thought would be a game changer."
Because brook lopez is huge and is just standing at the rim
Even Brook Lopez would be embarrassed by those rebounding numbers
"In spring 2011, I went to Disney's Animal Kingdom. Right by the Expedition Everest ride, there was an ice cream cart. I got in line behind two 7' tall white dudes. One of them farted and it started out like it was a goddamn train horn version of a whoopie cushion that petered out into a high pitched squeak over the course of 7 seconds. In the split second separating the fart from the laughter of the two treants in front of me, the smell hit everyone. It was the fastest traveling fart in recorded history, some say that the stench broke the smell/sound barrier. Basically imagine the smell of the rotten anus of a beached whale shortly before the gases cause the intestinal tract to rupture, you've got the smell.    The 7' tall culprit: Robin Lopez. His accomplice: his brother, Brook Lopez."
I mean for God’s sakes Brook Lopez offers the exact same skill set for a third of the price. You could probably ring Channing Frye and suit him up on a minimum if you just want a tall guy standing around the 3PT line jacking up 30 footers.
"besides that, man can't even grab rebounds that well. at this point, he's basically a slightly better brook lopez"
"Yeah I’m just saying people were saying that there wasn’t much room for Bigs who couldn’t shoot or stretch the floor in the NBA anymore the past few years, which is one of the reasons why people didn’t want to pay Gobert.  we had bigs like KAT, Jokic, AD, Embiid front and center.  This season though it’s felt like there have been a few teams that really rely on a big rim protector down low, Brook Lopez is another example though he can shoot."
*laughs in Brook Lopez*
Have fun getting exposed by fucking 33 year old Brook Lopez
Real Brook Lopez on the Nets energy there.
Imagine if they called it on Brook Lopez every time lmao. Would make the bucks defense collapse
If Tristan Thompson is doing this to them what are Brook Lopez and Giannis gonna do
"whoa whoa. You gotta guard Giannis, Middleton, Holiday, and Brook Lopez next series."
"I think the way things have shaken out this year have led to Donte being a really good fit. Him picking up good rebounding on the offensive end has helped a lot when Giannis isn't on the floor since Brook Lopez isn't a rebounding centre. Jrue/Forbes/Portis are all shooting at career high levels and have over-performed on that end compared to what was expected, so Donte hasn't had to do too much on that end.  It's *extremely* hypothetical, but even if we still got Portis/Forbes/Tucker with the Bogdanovic trade (which we wouldn't have been able to get all of) then I'm not entirely convinced that it wouldn't be a case of diminishing returns on scoring options compared to what we got from Donte on defense. To be fair outside of Khris there's not an exceptional 3PT shooter in the starting five, so maybe Bogdanovic does knock it up a level. I don't know, and I'm not saying Donte is a better player than Bogdanovic, but the development of the team has made Donte into a much better asset than he would be elsewhere."
Nets all time leading scorer Brook Lopez
What should he do to be better? Not get guarded by a combo of Giannis / PJ / Jrue with Brook Lopez sagging way off of Bam.
Brook Lopez
"The Nets already have a disadvantage in the frontcourt in the expected series. But not only Giannis but Brook will get to abuse the paint if Green isn’t there, and it will allow the Bucks more chances to play Lopez."
"I agree with all of this... except Olynyk changes this series massively. Brook Lopez is only allowed to camp in the paint because nothing is drawing him out. What better than a 7-foot shooting guard who keeps taking 3s when he gets an inch of breathing room to keep a paint-sitting behemoth honest? With Brook out of the way, Jimmy and Bam have far more room to work with on the interior.  We’re also suffering on boards. I know Olynyk is no Capela, but he was a 7 footer. That counts for something."
"I hope so too, seeing him shot long on every single one of those mid range just below the elbow or free throw line is maddening, first off you're an nba player, why are you missing that more than you make it, second- when you take it why are you going through the full shot form from their, it's obvious that going through the full motion is gonna shoot long, that's why EVERYONE else does a floater or something along those lines, just a little one handed push, and if you go through the full motion why not use the backboard, it is there for a reason, Brook Lopez is basically just waiting at the rim"
All he can do effectively in this series is drop***   Switching Brook Lopez onto Kyrie Irving or James Harden is instant death. They can probably switch 1-4 in that series but Lopez switching onto any of their stars is just asking to get curb stomped.
brook lopez handled the rest
"Brook Lopez was stepping up on the perimeter, that's a difference from the first 2 games. And not only was he stepping up on the perimeter, he was guarding REALLY well on the perimeter as well."
He's 6 ft 9 and can't score on Brook Lopez. Moving him to PF would allow him to attack mismatches better.
Brook Lopez has the slowest rip through of all time
brah jimmys getting clamped by brook lopez too oml
Brook Lopez thinks hes Robin Lopez
Power ranking centers in this series:  Brook Lopez  Bobby Portis   Dwayne Dedmon  Bam Hibbert
So spo puts bam on Giannis which I was waiting to see...but then brook lopez just starts shooting over smaller defenders. If hes gonna keep hitting shots they're not guardable
Brook Lopez looking like his Nets version
"Lol, sassy much. You are taking the word player too literally. When people say so and so is my favorite player, they can talk about on and off the court behaviors.   Magic did sign LeBron, but Kobe played a big part in recruiting him. As president, Magic did several things that set Lakers back. To name a few, letting Brook Lopez walk and traded Zubac for Muscala.  You aren't even a Lakers fan, you getting so riled up in our business it's hilarious."
"Agreed, but what I've seen so far is not so much the Bucks having all the answers defensively, it's mostly Bam's unwillingness to attack Lopez. Yes, Butler shouldn't    be expected to score much against Giannis but Bam could definitely draw some fouls in the restricted area, or make some mid-range 2s and force Brook out of there.  The rest of their offense shouldn't struggle too much against a team that gives up so many 3s. You have Robinson, Nunn and Dragic, you should take advantage of that. These three average between 38% and 41% on like 20 3PA per game. With Brook's drop defense, every Bam screen + hand-off should lead to an open 3. We have Middleton chasing Robinson ffs, he can literally average 8 3s per game if he wants to."
"And the way to protect your weaker defensive wing after that switch ? Having an effective rim protector behind him.  Very few teams play 5 out, guys like Brook Lopez, Gobert, Noel, Embiid were the key to elite defense this season again.  You look at all the players who've closed games at center for finals team recently : AD, Bam, Draymond, Marc Gasol, Ibaka, Tristan Thompson, Bosh, Duncan,...  Most those teams had weaker links defensively (the Cavs were not a good defensive team) but were still elite defensively"
"I mean I think you’re being disingenuous if you say that Gary Harris and KCP can do what Ben can do while also saying that Capela can “maybe” do what Gobert can do. If players like KCP are the bar for perimeter defence, guys like Derrick Favours, Serge Ibaka, Marc Gasol, Nurkic, Draymond, Poeltl , Gifford, Robin Lopez, Giannis, Brook Lopez, Jarrett Allen + more should all count as “acceptable” defensive anchors"
"I found Robin Lopez, who's Brook Lopez"
Couldn’t find anything of theirs on YouTube. Only found some guy named Brook Lopez
&gt;Miami played well but nothing spectacular. Still almost took game 1 away. If you think this series is over then you’re just telling everyone you’re a casual.  I'm a casual? The Heat don't have an answer for the Bucks interior defence and can only hope that they get hot from 3 and the Bucks can't hit shit. Brook Lopez is camping the rim and daring Bam to shoot who has completely lost confidence in himself and has Jimmy Butler literally yelling at him to shoot and Giannis and Brook are smothering any drives Jimmy has to the rim and neutering his offence.  I'm not saying it will be a sweep but they are severely outclassed at literally every position and you are delluded if you think they can win this.
"&gt;Tell me you don't watch the Heat without telling me you don't watch the Heat.   Ok, so Brook Lopez isn't daring Bam to shoot?"
"Brook and Robin lopez spent some time with him. Didn't come back with any new moves the next season.   Only guy that seemed to get anything out of Hakeems workouts was Kobe, which makes sense because most bigs arent agile enough to do the things Hakeem could."
"Didn't he break his foot 2 months ago? That'd be a crazy quick return.   That's the injury that made Brook Lopez and Kevin Durant miss entire seasons. Matter of fact, both Lopez and Durant tried to come back early but ended up re-aggravating the injury IIRC."
I remember feeling pretty damn hopeless at the beginning of the 15-16 season   I also remember playing the 73-9 Warriors early in the season and Brook Lopez missed an easy floater to win the game and we went to OT and lost (I think the Warriors were at least 10-0 by that point)
That first game was an anomaly Brook Lopez game too. Raps were the better team for sure that season
"Ahhh I got it. I definitely still feel that way about harden, don’t get me wrong I love him but don’t have that strong connection to him.   Kd and Kyrie are different. KD is sort of this mythical god that hasn’t felt real since the day we signed him, and Kyrie completely feels like a net and I think has more of a connection with the fans than any Brooklyn player not named Brook Lopez or Caris Levert."
Using KAT as a glorified Brook Lopez on offense kinda seems like a waste
One team has Brook Lopez. He’s a good two way center with a respectable 3 point shot and good rim protection. His old weakness in rebounding can be more covered easily and he’s not slow as molasses.  All our listed centers have flaws that are easy to exploit. Montrez is too undersized at times and exposed on defense. Marc would’ve been perfect if he was couple years younger but he’s much older and can get torched by smaller line ups. Drummond straight up sucks unless it’s rebounding. Last years centers Javale and Dwight were excellent rim protectors with their only real weaknesses is that they could be played off the floor by smaller and faster lineups and that they couldn’t shoot. Needless to say Magic was an idiot for letting Brook go.
"2014 nets They had a really good team on paper   Dwill, joe Johnson, Paul Pierce and Brook lopez all needed the ball to be effective   Joe Johnson and Pierce were iso scorers   Dwill was ball dominant and didn't move offball   Brook lopez wasmt a pick and roll or pick and pop player they fed him in the post and he created his own offense from the post"
"b/c bucks have a floor spacer in brook lopez and lakers dont have ANYONE, ANYONE at all that can SPACE the FLOOR."
"I’m not mad, these players were dealt and it had nothing to do with Davis.  D Lo was traded for Brook Lopez, how did that get the Lakers a ring.  I didn’t have an argument, I made a statement.  They draft well and gave up on them too early, you wanted to argue. Maybe get a life"
Nets with 85 percent. Brook Lopez is not playable against the nets
Brook Lopez too
"That’s basically what the ‘19 team was supposed to be, except we wouldn’t have had to trade a player and/or picks for a good C because Brook Lopez wanted to return. Why the team didn’t sign him I’ll never know. He’s the perfect center next to Lebron"
Brook “Nets all time leading scorer” Lopez
Nets Lopez jersey on. Tough but great shot Brook. Keep it up you stud.
Brook Lopez at the end of the first half is Michael Jordan
Brook “dame” lopez
Is that Dame or Brook Lopez?
Brook Lopez Brooklyn Legend
"Brook ""Steph Curry"" Lopez"
Nets goat Brook Lopez from Curry range
"BROOK ""STEPH CURRY"" LOPEZ EVERYBODY"
What does Brook Lopez bring to the table that Bobby Portis doesn’t?
Pls teach Giannis that shot Lopez. Forget working with Hakeem. At least gon Brook Lopez’s level lol.
"Brook did nothing there, wtf. Green should have been called for using his arm to push Lopez if anything lol"
"You mean Brook Lopez, aka Splash Mount Fuji"
"He's absolutely lazy relatively speaking. Guys who used to have absolutely no outside shot like Serge Ibaka worked hard and added one. Brook Lopez took a grand total of seven three point attempts over his first six seasons. He's less athletic and mobile than Simmons, but he worked hard and now takes 300 threes a year. What's Ben's excuse?  This is a shooter's league right now and having a guard that literally does not shoot from the perimeter is crazy. There's no way the Sixers haven't been on him to develop a shot, but he hasn't. He takes even fewer shots beyond 10' than he did as a rookie. What's his excuse?"
"I think the (healthy) Nets are so top heavy, that they’d need a great role player.   Brook Lopez for size, or a playmaker who could come off the bench (I think it’d be cheating to bring Kidd off the bench). Maybe Deron Williams? I know it’s not Utah Williams, but he’s still good enough to be the playmaker for when Harden sits."
"Yeah that was the year the Nets went all-in with KG, Pierce, Joe, Deron Williams and Brook Lopez."
Second team: trae young/ booker or Mitchell/ tatum/ bam/ Brook Lopez . Not sure who is beating the us team. US team weakness is really only at the Centre spot.
"Bucks about to go 3/3 on postseason disappointments. Bud putting connaughton on KD and Giannis 30mpg inbound. Brook Lopez shooting corner 3s with Mike James on him, Giannis shooting top of the key 3s"
Shoutout to those Brook Lopez/Courtney Lee days
"In game 4 I feel like our offense and defense had changed. Giannis was taking less jumpers and going more off the ball. Brook Lopez was contesting shots instead of dropping. I'd say our only problem is not having Lopez run off-ball like we have been all-year, but Giannis has been playing 40+ and there's little to no time when it's just Brook so it's understandable. Our bench guys are looking like themselves, and more, too."
"Bro he’s done. He’s 25, he’s not gonna shoot anytime soon.  There have been players like Brook Lopez and Jason Kidd that got better at shooting but they weren’t straight up scared to shoot a jumper like Ben"
"If we had a love or brook lopez then we'd be better. The lack of size inside to just rebound or even barely contest is readily apparent if you watch us at all. it was always we had to outscore that deficit but missing harden, kyrie, and even dinwiddie makes it bad. if we had even dinwiddie i'd say it'd be even-ish with those cavs"
Brook Lopez probably id think.
"How many back to back MVP’s have there been, then there’s Middleton who has been a top 20 player the last two seasons, and Jrue who is a top 30 player and Brook Lopez who is somewhere in the 40-50 range.  It’s a pretty stacked starting 5 for the Bucks. Bench beats out the Net’s too."
Me to Brook Lopez if Bucks eliminate us:  https://i.imgur.com/1WrC34W.gifv
"Well if there's any player I would pick to lose to, it would be Brook Lopez."
"Nobody talked shit because he did not start shooting threes in New Jersey, he was 0-7 in 6 years in New Jersye   Also Brook Lopez had great mid range and was a 80% FT shooter  He barely attempted any and a lot were at the end of the shotclock, when he actually started shooting he was right away great for a big man  This is one of the dumbest false things i've read, it's amazing how fans just straight up becomes delusional with players"
"I don't like his shot selection but to cope,  I remind myself about how much shit people talked about Brook Lopez when he started shooting 3s in New Jersey."
"You wrote up a great explanation of why Giannis shouldn't put at center for 36-40 against Embiid and the Sixers. Problem is, they are playing the Nets and he's already guarding the biggest, most physical player on the opposing team.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ1xUsMet30  Pay close attention to who is on the floor for the Nets and who Giannis is matching up with. I'll let you in on a little secret: it's Blake Griffin. Brook Lopez is guarding Bruce Brown. They take Lopez out and Giannis is still guarding Griffin. Only when Giannis goes out does Lopez take that assignment. During that run with Giannis at center, he is also guarding Griffin.  The role change you are talking about is way more theoretical than actual. Gotta adjust the theory to the situation, you know?"
"Oh yeah, Brook Lopez is not Al Horford, but hes not gonna get 40 dropped on him"
I saw a post a while back on here saying something along the lines of “Brook Lopez sounds like someone who’s trying to imitate how Brook Lopez would sound” and I think that’s the most accurate description
Brook Lopez low key sounds like Brock lesner
Brook Lopez
"Brook Lopez (and Robin) when I heard his first interview when he got into the league but now that he's been around for awhile, everyone is used to it."
"For the Knicks sake I actually hope it’s true   This far into someone career one year shooting way above their average is rarely maintained   Recent example: Brook Lopez 37% on 6 attempts in 2018, hasn’t broken 34% since   I’d expect Randle to drop to around 35% maybe on less attempts tbh"
And his defense was atrocious too. Crown jewel was when pj and brook lopez crossed him over in a span of 5 seconds. KD was sliding like a snow dancer in that sequence.
The 2013 Nets would be one of the best teams ever lol  Deron Williams/Jason Terry/Shaun Livingston  Joe Johnson/Marcus Thornton/Marquis Teague  Paul Pierce/Mirza Teletovic/Alan Anderson   Kevin Garnett/Andrei Kirilenko/Andray Blatche/Reggie Evans  Brook Lopez/Mason Plumlee/Jason Collins  The worst player in the starting line up for this team is the all time leading scorer for the Nets lol
I swear every time I watch Brook Lopez take a corner 3 I get scared he's gonna step out of bounds. The space between the 3 point line and out of bounds is barely large enough to contain his giant feet. I think he has inadvertently stepped out multiple times this season.
"This is the Nets. KG and pals are memed hard but they were scary back in the day when they were not injured. I don't think they played a single game with everyone healthy but they got young Brook Lopez, AK47, KG, Deron Williams, Joe Johnson, Marcus Thornton, Jason Terry and Pierce. That bunch could have taken it all the way. They swept the Heat during regular season.  These fans can't catch a break."
"I dont know, I think Lopez can bother Embiid. Marc Gasol has pulled it off. Maybe brook can do it as well ."
Philly is the one team you want to play Brook Lopez 35 minutes plus because he can body Embiid.  Outside of him it's Portis who'd get eaten alive and PJ Tucker who is strong enough but too short.
https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/joel-embiid-vs-brook-lopez
https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/joel-embiid-vs-brook-lopez
Bobby portis is a 37.5% three point shooter in these playoff Brook Lopez is 23.5% Brook also shot 33.8 in the regular season to Bobby’s 47.1 so unless your telling me Bobby forgot how to shot over his last 4 attempts he’s clearly a better shooter then Brook considering they get the same looks open catch and shoot threes
"Harden will be forced back early for sure. Idk how he Won't reagitate his hamstring against the bucks honestly. Fucking brook Lopez, Giannis, and even jrues physical defense. Idk what must be going through Nash's head right now..."
the bucks would be a lot better against nets if giannis took brook lopez minutes tbh  injuries may have saved bud job
Brook Lopez is one of the few guys that can match his size and physicality but doesn’t have the mobility.
Might be Brook Lopez at this point
"Lol watching him trying to go side to side on brook lopez when he shot 47% from three was pretty funny. He’s missed some open looks from three too though, i think he’s in his own head a bit"
Sixers fans keep saying that but I haven't really heard any sixers fans concerned about the sixers being able to score consistently on the bucks. I doubt simmons and harris will be able to do much against giannis and Jrue and having giannis play free safety will be tough on embiid for getting to the rim. The sixers also don't really have any real ways to punish the Bucks basic Brook Lopez drop scheme. Would be a very defensive series
I hate that Giannis is likeable and brook lopez is such a god . Makes it hard as a nets fan to hate the bucks lol
No one asked for this but here are some nicknames I have given to players:  - Robin Lopez: Caveman - Brook Lopez: Cavebrother - PJ Tucker: Uncle Tuck - Cauley-Stein: Prison Fresh - Jrue Holiday: Lil’ Yachty
"some bucks fans are hella obnoxious. They act like they got a chip on their shoulder when they're one of the best teams in the league. that's why I somewhat dislike them anyways ( they got Brook Lopez and PJ Tucker, can't hate on old man PJ)"
I feel like Brook Lopez doesn’t shoot the 3 as well as the media says he does
Brook Lopez moves at 0.5x speed
does Marc Jackson think PJ Tucker made that 3 instead of Brook Lopez lol
Brook Lopez looks like a serial killer on the low
“THAT WAS *SO* CLEAN”  — Brook Lopez
If that's 2013 Griffin Brook Lopez is dust rn
Brook Lopez move your fat ass foot
WHAT THE FUCK BROOK LOPEZ
Brook Lopez fucking sucks idk why he's even playing
I don't think Brook Lopez should be the primary ball handler. Come on Bucks wtf you doing?
"I beg to disagree I think shooting is the thing that a lot of ppl add to their game especially when players start to lose their athleticism and they want to stay in the league. Examples J Kidd, Drose, Blake Griffin, Vince Carter, Brook Lopez etc"
Bobby portis &gt; brook lopez?
"They don't even go for the mismatch, they had a possession with Kyrie guarding Brook Lopez.  Brook didn't ask for the ball and just walked all the way back to the 3pt line, smh."
Giannis going iso is not the way and never will be. It hurts the team so god damn much. The problem is no one can tell anything to Yanes cause the Bucks organization has pegged him as the franchise player on the super max or whatever. Everything needs to run through Middleton and Jrue. Giannis needs to get his offense created by those two guys the same way Brook Lopez gets his touches.
"Brook Lopez guarded by Kyrie and they don't go for the mismatch, smh."
"I genuinely think Jonas would have done a fine job, he started shooting 3s at a decent clip, he was only 26 averaging 15 and 11 with a block per game. I think we would have been just fine, Jv always played well vs bigs like embidd, he’s a traditional big man. I think he would have had his problems vs the pick n roll, and vs brook lopez in the bucks series stretching the floor, but I honestly think they could have been interchanged."
well uh BROOK LOPEZ became curry at like age 33
Brook Lopez was going to be the difference.
"Brook Lopez  Bojan Bogdanovic  Brook Lopez   Sean ""undrafted"" Kilpatrick   Markel Brown   Bargnani   Joe Johnson   RHJ until he broke his ankle/foot forget which one   Karasev   Thomas Robinson   Donald Sloan   Shane Larkin  Chris McCollough (I remember the a lot of the fan base being super high on him, including me)"
"So the main criticisms this post-season are:  1.  Playing Brook Lopez in drop coverage instead of PJ Tucker at the 5.  Drop coverage doesn't work against players that can hit mid-range jumpers at a high clip like KD/Kyrie.  **IMO Legit complaint**  2.  Not adjusting to the Nets dropping coverage against Giannis.  Drop coverage works great against players that can't punish you by hitting open jumpers like Giannis.   **IMO semi/legit complaint**    Giannis' offensive woes in the half court suggest that he needs to be moved to center, PJ to the 4 and a 3rd guard inserted into the lineup to help with offense.   Which will be difficult with Divencenzo's injury.  Bud's reluctance to make these changes boils down to 1) he never makes changes 2) he doen'st have the guard depth on his roster to make changes  The Bucks GM did a piss poor job of constructing his roster for the playoffs.  You need quality point guard play and the Bucks don't have one; Jrue is more of a combo guard pretending to be a point guard.  Bucks need someone who can break the defense off the dribble and set up his bigs."
"\- Weird rotations in game 1  \- no offensive structure, the Nets switch almost everything, which means you need some creativity and not just iso 70 times per game, the Bucks never slip screens, never cut off the ball, never try multi screen actions  \- Insistence on playing Giannis like he is a perimeter player, he' s not, he should play like AD, not like KD, he's a roll man, not a mid post iso guy  \- weird use of Brook Lopez, the guy randomly goes from having 10 post up per game (and hes good at it even if he can't pass out of it) to being used like he's Channing Frye  \- no ""target pnr"", when you play against a team that switches a lot, target the weak links, screen for Middleton/Giannis with Kyrie's or Mike James's or Shamet's defender. screening with Lopez to get Claxton on Middleton for example is completly useless  \- I won't blame him for the drop coverage tho, I was before this year, but Lopez is so much better than any of their ""small"" so they have to play him and he can't switch...also Giannis has looked absolutely terrible when he switched onto KD or Kyrie so I understand"
"There's no shame in losing to the Nets, even without Harden. But it's the way the Bucks are losing, the except same way as the EFC meltdown vs. the Raptors and the same way as vs. the Heat last season. Part of that is the (lack of) basketball IQ from the players but it's also on the coach for not putting the players in a position to succeed. Why does Brook Lopez rarely post up? It'd be especially usefull if Giannis is off the floor.  Why doesn't Jrue run the PnR with Giannis? Why is Pat Connaughton his favorite player?"
he is not receiving enough strays   everyone but him sees that brook lopez against nets doesnt work out
"That the league has gone too much shooting, so much so that pretty good post up players like brook lopez only get used as spot up shooters. I think coaches are gonna notice that soon and correct a little bit"
Brook Lopez was elite at guarding the rim yesterday.  He had 6 blocks and a ton of shot alters at the rim.
"I kinda doubt it, throwing game 2 like they did is the sort of thing that gets a coach fired. If they lose in game 7, owner can go ""well, if our coach had us prepared for game 2, maybe we would have won this series"". Also Bucks not going enough Giannis at Center when Brook Lopez is getting picked at on defense over and over (though he did have a good 4th quarter in game 3).   Honestly offense really wasn't better in terms of process than game 2. Giannis was just more aggressive (though eventually Nets got comfortable defending him), and Middleton hit the shots he normally does. Bucks offense the last 3 quarters was still very stagnant."
"Embiid is the product of no interior post defender bigs anymore. 15-20 years ago, Not only would every team have a big who could defend and score in the post, but every team had at least 1 bench player who couldn’t score or pass but only really could defend and rebound. Guys who were just there for six fouls. Those players don’t exist anymore. No one really defends in the post at all anymore period.   I’m not saying all these guys back then we’re so great, they weren’t. They’re just a different type of player. The fact that they don’t exist is what embiid uses to look “so good”— look at brook lopez. He’s considered some sort of elite paint defender when he’s legit very average. A random dude like Antonio mcdyess would silence embiid in the paint, much less MFing SHAQ"
"It's shocking how much Brook Lopez is playing. Giannis playing center is one of the best weapons in the league and something that the Nets would have no answer for. They have the personnel to do it now that they have Tucker. And yet in basiccally a must win game I don't think it happened for even a minute.  If Draymond or AD never played any center in the playoffs, they'd have at most one championship between them imo. Luckily for them, their coaches have eyes."
they were a much worse team and barely beat the Brook Lopez-led Nets in 7 games off the back of Nate Robinson’s heroics  wow so crazy what a stacked team
Brook Lopez?
"I mean he had 9 seconds to get the ball to KD who was unstoppable late and he decided to drive on 7 foot brook lopez, it’s not like he didn’t have any other options"
So taking a contested layup against Brook Lopez is a better idea? It’s not like the nets don’t have Kd who was cooking
"They were literally trapping Kyrie from 30 feet out, Bruce passing to Kyrie would just burn the clock and bog down the offense, the driving lane was there and it was the right play to try to beat Brook Lopez to the spot (ideally you would want Brown to kick it out to Harris but Brown is not that type of passer), if there is one person blame it is Steve Nash or Dantoni for not being able to make a good inbound play to get one of their stars a good shot, contrast to Bud who , drafted a really good ATO play to get Middleton open."
Brook Lopez had 6 blocks dude..
"Exactly, I'm a life long Nets fan since 2004. I've been dying for a meaningful playoff run, but this ain't it. Technically my team are title favorites/contenders, but they're not my team; it's just a core of mercenary superstars that just happened to pick my team. This team is not the Nets, it's just the hollow shell that Kyrie, KD, and Harden chose to play under. Whenever I express this I get downvoted and told that I'll forget about all that once they win, but that's just not true. When operating under these circumstances there is no team culture or team identity, there is literally nothing but the name that identifies the team as the Brooklyn Nets. Jason Kidd, Vince Carter, Richard Jefferson, Nenad Krstic, Brook Lopez, Caris Levert, D'Angelo Russell, Jarrett Allen, and others in the same vein meant something to the identity of the Nets. They may not have all joined the team in the same way, but they put roots down in the organization and tried to build something meaningful. A key component of the joy of winning a championship as a fan is building up to the point where your team can win it all. If the Nets win it all, I won't look at them and say the Nets finally won a title, I'll just say Kyrie, KD, and Harden won a title and that won't mean shit to me."
"Yeah, it was hard for me to decide which one had the most terrible center performance tonight between Favors and Brook Lopez."
"He takes a share of the blame no doubt, but the majority of the blame should be on the talent/abilities of the roster.  I don’t think there’s a coach in the world (past or present) that could mold this team’s abilities into a title winner.  There’s a lot of flaws, starting with the superstar’s flaws, that keep the Bucks from being a legitimate title contender.  Brook Lopez playing 35 minutes tonight is one just off the top of my head.  Roster isn’t deep and has a bunch of holes"
"They went to 6 against a 38-44 Nets team led by Jarrett Jack, the corpse of Deron Williams and Brook Lopez  Then were a half second away from going to 7 against the Wizards (the 3 game off Paul Pierce's hand a tick after the buzzer)  It was quite obvious that Cavs Bulls was the ECF that year"
Shoutout to Brook Lopez who turned into Dikembe Mutomb in the second half!
"My biggest problem isn't even us running ISO tbh. I understand it at least (almost) ensures you aren't gonna turn the ball over. What I don't get is  1. That zone he ran in game 2, during which we got torched - we gave up so many open threes to elite shooters 2. How many times does Bruce Brown need to make an uncontested floater / layup for him to call a timeout and ask Brook to stop giving these up and contest them. Happened like 5 times in a row and he made 4 or 5 of them 3. Why he doesn't call a timeout the moment Giannis takes a transition 3 and tell him to fucking stop this shit and only do it if we can't run a better play - after all, Giannis can take an open 3 anytime 4. Why don't we run Jrue - Giannis PnRs? I remember Jrue and AD PnR being deadly and Giannis can roll / catch a lob just as well 5. Why doesn't he play a Giannis - Tucker lineup that can double team KD and runs drop coverage with Lopez against a team with elite shooters 6. Why do Pat and Forbes look bored / gassed on offense? I miss Donte."
Brook lopez had to be up there
He was awful in the first half. Brooklyn ran the same play like 5 times down resulting in a Brown floater over Lopez and it cut the lead to 4. Those are the shots we want brook defending and he didn’t do it at all in the first half. The good news is he really stepped up in the second half and contested a fuckton of shots at the rim which is exactly what we need him doing.
"Brook has been a good defender for like seven or [eight years now] (https://www.espn.com/blog/new-york/brooklyn-nets/post/_/id/10478/lopez-playing-career-d), but kudos nonetheless"
"What's worrying is that this is literally the best possible outcome for us while playing drop coverage and Lopez has always been late to contest floaters. I'm not gonna pretend I know the ideal way to protect the rim as a center, but I was always curious about this... isn't it better if a center contests these floaters faster, even if he's risking giving up an open layup sometimes?   Is it something Brook is just bad at adjusting to or is he doing exactly what Bud tells him to? What was the reason he started contesting them in the second half by moving 2 feet away from the basket, which resulted in Brown bricking everything?"
"1. Clippers (with prime boogie, Ibaka, and rondo)   2. Nets (without harden)  3. The Phoenix Suns (except replace Chris Paul with 14 year old Chris paul)   4. The Denver Nuggets (but with a cooler team name than “nuggets” and MPJ was also less weird)  5. The Philadelphia 76ers(without embiid)  6. Bucks (but everyone is replaced by mooses except for brook lopez who can’t tell what’s going wrong on defense)  7. The Utah jazz (except all their players are replaced by a speaker playing jazz music except for Rudy gobert who is not sure what’s going wrong on defense)  8. The Hawks (without trae young)"
Brook Lopez player of the game imo
Im not even a Bucks fan and Im mad 2x MVP settles on jumpshots over Blake Griffin.  Milwaukee needs to thank Brook Lopez for his insane efforts.
"I believe a post-centric offense can work in the NBA. Depends on if a team is actually willing to play that way. Also, who even has the ability to play that way anymore. Nobody really has the ability besides Embiid, Jokic, Brook Lopez. Maybe JV as well, but everyone just plays face up"
"hardcap only triggered in 3 cases  1) a team receives a free agent via S&amp;T (examples: nets getting KD, gsw getting DLo)  2) a non-taxpaying team uses more than the taxpayer midlevel exception amount of their midlevel exception (example: lakers after signing montrezl harrell last season)  3) a team uses their bi-annual exception (example: bucks after signing brook lopez in 2018, they also used their MLE)"
"Brook Lopez, Caris LeVert, D'Angelo Russell, Jarrett Allen for the Nets. None of them left on their own though so no reason at all not to like them. They were all traded."
He’s gonna have either Brook Lopez or Clint capella in his way
Hawks in 7. With how bad Jrue and Khris been the Bucks will need Brook Lopez or Pat Connaughton to score 15-20
"I mean what other options they got, Brook Lopez I suppose?"
"“Welcome to game 7 of the finals… now, after last nights incident, the only two remaining players to remain uninjured  are Brook Lopez and Cam Payne. We have now heard from the officials that HORSE will be played to determine the 2021 NBA champions…”"
And two games in a row now where he's mistaken Pat Connaughton for Brook fucking Lopez.
"Hm I have something similar. For me it's Brooks Lopez. I hate his stupid face. He just looks like such a jerk. I know he's probably a nice guy but every time I see him on the TV I am angered by this man. He's the one guy who is stuck in my head and sometimes I wonder if the nba would be a better place without him but I know that's wrong. I hate how he gets those offensive rebounds. I hate how little fouls he doesn't get called on him. I want this man gone. If I was a nba superstar I would probably try to fight him even if he did nothing wrong. I have never felt so angered at someone who has done nothing to me or my team. He's a scumbag and I have no evidence of it. I hate him. I wish he would just go into retirement. He is the main bad guy behind everything in a movie. I hate Brooks Lopez and if I ever was given anything that has something to do with him other than his failures I would burn it. I don't know why and I don't know how, but all I know is that If I was in a video game, he would be the final boss. I hate freaking Brook Robert Lopez of the Milwaukee Bucks. I hate him."

He's overrated and defers to Brook Lopez in crunch time I'm good
"Great question, and again, unlikely the Nuggets would bite on something like that but here’s the reasoning behind doing something like this. If it’s an ACL, Giannis won’t be fully healthy until the 2023 season. By then Jrue will be 32 and Khris will be turning 31. Lopez will 34 and PJ will probably be retired. The Bucks own next year’s pick and then that’s it. You basically have one year to do a mini rebuild. Khris, Jrue and Brook are good enough to make the playoffs in the East as a 7/8 seed. That does nothing for you when Giannis gets back because he will most assuredly be rusty and then you go into the playoffs as a tremendous underdog and probably lose in the first round and hope Jrue and particularly Lopez don’t show significant signs of aging which is a real risk considering the defensive and offensive burden they’ll have to take on with Giannis gone. So if it’s 2023 and Giannis is finally fully healthy would you rather have 25-year-old Jamal Murray plus healthy Giannis at 27 years old and a good lottery pick? Or Giannis plus the older players I mentioned and like the 20th overall pick? Giannis is locked up long term regardless, but the timeline just got shifted back at least two seasons."
"In terms of fit, I bet he'd be playing a similar role to brook Lopez rn. Big man who just sits outside the perimeter on offense and gets you some blocks here or there. Very nice fantasy wise but garbage irl impact. Kristaps just isn't cut out to be a reliable 2nd option on a good team and he definitely isn't good enough to be the 1st option on an nba team."
"Also, brook lopez is far past his prime, he’s at best a plus rim defender and a plus shooter rn"
"The Hawks are built around Trae??? They still have Khris and Jrue who are all stars. Brook Lopez has good scoring ability.   Kevin Huerter, Bogdan, and Lou Williams are the Hawks playmakers. The rest is Gallo doing his weird shit.   The offense does not get barely worse tf. They lost 29 and 10."
"Brook Lopez isn't that bad. He gets no love from his own team, he's totally offensively capable."
Bruh brook lopez is 7ft for nothing. Sad to giannis go down like this when he was about to go off .
Good point. At that point why not take someone like Brook Lopez though? We really need KAT to change his nationality.
Hawks without Trae lose points.  Bucks without Giannis lose points and 1st team all pro defense that not only covers his man but covers brook Lopez weakness
Brook Lopez is useless on defense.   We already knew that but Bud sure didn't.
"Brook Lopez now has an ""H"""
brook lopez is fucking USELESS when he's not shooting lights out he's a revolving door on defense holy fuck
I honestly can’t decide if Brook Lopez is a net positive or negative player for this Bucks team
Always the good players getting hurt smh why is it never like Brook Lopez
Brook Lopez fucking sucks. He doesn't even try for rebounds.
Getting murdered on the interior. Brook Lopez guarding the key.....
Brook Lopez in drop coverage is tragic
Brook Steel Curtain Lopez
"For fuck's sake, if Brook Lopez, a true inside scoring center who didn't attempt 3-pointers for the first 8 years of his career, can become a trebuchet and hit a respectable 36% clip from 3, Jordan could learn how to do it, and probably train like a psychopath at it to become a feared 3-point shooter."
Still laughing at the fact that Lou Will ripped an offensive board from Brook fucking Lopez
Brook Lopez is the slowest player in the NBA
It’s pretty amazing how bad the bucks are playing. Brook Lopez has no business being on the court. Bucks as a whole couldn’t play with less energy. A dead person has more life than them
"he would start over brook lopez , not pj"
I disagree. even though I'm a nets fan I feel like I have a pretty unbiased ranking.   Five: Kobe  Four: Lebron  Three: D'Angelo Russell  Two: Michael Jordan  One: Brook Lopez
I'd rather have Brook Lopez than Kevin Love at this point.
"Dr. J, Jason Kidd and Brook Lopez"
"Brook Lopez ,don't know if he turned them down."
Bucks def can go 5 out. Brook Lopez spends a lot of time on the perimeter.
"Espn is the new mtv,many have stopped watching  it because the channel  dropped the real reason people originally   watched it. Maybe that reason wasn't profitable so I get it.  On Jalen Rose, Kevin Love  is a guy who I said retired years ago but didnt tell anyone.   I don't know if he made the team because he is white but I do know other guys like Brook Lopez , John Collins even a Robert Covington deserved the slot more and bring more to the table. Because with that roster what he brings is redundant, he only brings they say experience. Outside shooting debatable.  And for Jalen, Ayton played on the Bahamas team so I don't know if he can play for team USA.  If you can't prove what you say might as well keep it to yourself."
would fit well next to Brook Lopez I guess
"Let me guess, Clint Capela and Brook Lopez?  Edit: Anyone who says Brook, I question their motives"
Deandre Jordan  Goran Dragic (international competition though idk)  Hayward  Brook Lopez  Jeff Teague
"I know Giannis is more of a help defender, but at some point Brook Lopez is going to age out and they're going to be very, very hard pressed to find another stretch 5 to put next to the Greek Freak.   The Bucks may have to consider using him as a 5 moving forward. Maybe not small-ball all of the time but yeah."
"We still had Giannis and Middleton (and Giannis was in all star/MVP-contender form for the last two years).    Didn't stop us from being a team that wouldn't have even made the playoffs if we were in the West, with Kidd's ""coaching.""  (And then immediately became the best regular season team in the league the next year by swapping him for Bud and adding Brook Lopez.)"
"If not for Love, who would’ve made the team? Myles Turner? Brook Lopez? Drummond? Doesn’t look that bad now does it."
"I think they misspoke and said it was his last game rather than the last series.  In many ways, it was a fitting tribute to the man who called Pat Connaughton Brook Lopez."
Because Bam ran into one of the best defences in the NBA? You really think Ayton woul'd dominate Brook Lopez and Giannis as much as Batum and Drummond?   Also 4 points is a lot especially when 80% of your makes are at the rim and assisted.
"Yeah I think he's more in the 9-22 range with a lot of room to debate.  My top 8 centers this season would be Jokic, Embiid, Vucevic, Gobert, Capela, Adebayo, KAT, and Valanciunas. I don't think you can really put Ayton above any of them.   He's in that second tier with Kanter, Jarret Allen, Mitchell Robinson, Porzingis, Ibaka, Zubac, Christian Wood, Robert Williams, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, Nurkic, Steven Adams, Theis, and Al Horford.  I think Ayton is probably around the 12th-16th best center in the league, though if he keeps up the form he's had these playoffs next season I could see him making a jump into the top 10."
"Yup, Brook Lopez was drafted in the 2000s"
For what reason would that be a tech other than the fact that Beverley is unlikeable? If someone like Brook Lopez does it it’s funny but if Beverly does it it’s a tech?
Jason Kidd? Brook Lopez? It happens when people put work
What Brook Lopez did when Thanasis left his assignment.
"Gallo was about to start a pick and roll with Trae. Better to have Thanasis there to switch than Brook Lopez. If executed properly, brook would guard Boggi in the corner and Thanasis switch onto Trae after the screen"
"There are no upgrades over Brook Lopez who are UFAs for next season. We have one of the only centres who can avoid creating spacing problems alongside Giannis, on a good contract. Outside of some obviously untouchable players there is no upgrade for us at the C out there that are within reach. Trading him to get a better two guard isn't a clear improvement when the options for Lopez replacements are obviously not as good."
"Because Gallo was about to start a pick and roll with Trae. Better to have Thanasis there to switch than Brook Lopez. If executed properly, brook would guard Bogey in the corner and Thanasis switch onto Trae after the screen"
"You're greatly underestimating how much a shitty coach/organization (not even mentioning worse teammates) affects the team.  Giannis was bulked up and essentially playing at MVP-contender levels the last couple years we had Kidd (not as good as he is now, but still a major force), and that definitely didn't stop us from being a dumpster fire fighting for the 6-8 seed in the weaker East.  Then we hire a competent coach (one that people still shit on as if he was on Kidd's level) and replace John Henson with Brook Lopez in the starting lineup, and immediately we're the best (regular season) team in the league, and immediately go from bad, below-league-average defense, to essentially the top defensive team in the league.  (Brook is certainly a big upgrade over Henson, but definitely not big enough for that massive of a difference, ha.)"
"Name a decent centre in the league who a) is tradeable (no Jokic, Embiid, Ayton), b) can salary match with a ~13 million player, c) won't require picks in exchange for a 34 year old, and d) is an upgrade over Brook Lopez."
"It’s because Brook Lopez defends pick and rolls the same way he did.  Fortunately for him, that wasn’t nearly as big of a problem in his day."
If Brook Lopez &amp; Zubac can get 25+ mins in the playoffs then I’m sure the 80s-00s (Can’t comment on the 60s-most of the 70s) cement pylons would be able to easily average 35+ given what they could do on offense.
In a world where Ayton will be guarded by Brook Lopez.
Brook Lopez is the Nets leading scorer.  He was a very good player and better than Bam.
My bad I didn't read it correctly but your list is still shit. Guess you're the one that can't think straight. Who tf takes brook Lopez over bam.
I’ll always be grateful for OKC not finalizing the Reggie Jackson for Brook Lopez trade and sending him to Detroit at the last second.   That led to a Butterfly Effect that landed the Nets their Big 3.   If the trade went through the Nets would have been paying Jackson a ton of $ and who knows if he gets injured the same way. This would have been done during the Billy King tenure instead of Sean Marks.   Since the trade fell through the Nets were able to flip Lopez for D’Lo and Mozgov. D’Lo then led the Nets to the Playoffs and helped make them look legitimate enough for Kyrie and Durant to want to play in Brooklyn.
His plus minus has way more to do with Brook Lopez not playing than with him playing.  Brook is getting destroyed on Trae pick and rolls. Anytime he is on the court they look for that.
Brook lopez
"its not wide open, brook blocked a few of them in game 2  and running portis instead and going small has its own risks, because portis does a much worse job defending trae on the perimeter than their big lineup does.   that shimmy 3 trae did in game 1 came off bobby portis messing up the switch and ending up in totally the wrong position  and also, if trae is gonna heat up with his floater then budenholzer showed he's willing to bring in the smallball portis lineup anyway, brook barely played in the 2nd half of game 3.   but if trae is cold from midrange then they are probably better off running lopez.  especially with the spacing he gives them"
"""Other than Brook Lopez""  Brook Lopez be like, ""The fuck did I do."""
"Imo Brook Lopez, Jarrett Allen, Rob Williams would have all been better picks for that last roster spot. I wonder if they just didn't want to join? Lopez is in the middle of a deep playoff run, Allen is probably in bubble wrap before he signs the big contract, and Rob Williams has had injury issues.         The only player type they're really missing is true rim protector to go up against some of the other top teams. Love is sort of a stretch big who won't help on defense. Durant does everything Love does but significantly better and other players on the team can easily make up for Love's shooting. The other benefit of getting a guy like Allen and Williams is that they would get valuable experience in the international rules and be set up to help out in future years too."
Brook Lopez has phenomenal defense he’s just slow.
Jason Kidd  Drazen Petrovic  Julius Erving  Buck Williams  Brook Lopez

He called Pat Connaughton Brook Lopez 😂😂😂
Only Chuck could use insulting Shaq as a framing device just to snipe Brook Lopez
&gt; I've seen plenty of HS boys games with no dunks  The issue isn't just dunks it's shooting in general.  If you can dunk a ball easily you are naturally going to have higher percentage shooting inside.  See Brook Lopez and his hooks that literally come from above the basket without elevating.
Definitely Brook Lopez
It’s cause he plays when Brook Lopez sits
He called Pat Connaughton Brook Lopez at one point
He also called 6'5 Pat Con 7 foot Brook Lopez.
Shaq be shitting on most top centers in the league but will defend the MF'n Brook Lopez lmao
Curving the bullet wanted style to pull off the collateral on Brook Lopez was pretty impressive
"It is insane to me how badly the Bucks are at defending him, and how stubbornly they refuse to adjust. They are *constantly* letting Trae take wide open floaters, a shot that is easy money for him and that every single team *knows* he wants to take. Brook Lopez is frankly unplayable in this series, yet they continue to let Trae slaughter him for 20+ minutes a night. Credit where it's due to Trae, he's a fantastic player, but Coach Bud is allowing this to happen and he *needs* to go."
Brook Lopez isn’t hurt.
We know about Giannis! We know about Middleton! We know about Brook Lopez and all them boys!
does bud have a fetish for playing Brook lopez more than Portis? or is Portis not good in extended minutes?
Brook Lopez is pretty useless close it out with Giannis at the 5
"Brook ""what's a pick &amp; roll"" lopez: -17  Bobby portis: +17  Someone tell bud"
All the Bucks need is Brook Lopez to start taking rebounds or play some average defence. Middleton to stop shooting bricks and be average and Jrue not going for the layup and losing the ball. So really the Bucks need to be average and they will win but somehow they refuse to even do that. It's so tilting watching them play basketball especially when Giannis is play at his best as per usual and not getting any calls by the refs meanwhile Young is getting the most ridiculous calls
Have you ever seen brook lopez go crazy? That’s the scariest man on the court for sure
Brook lopez -13 Bobby Portis +12
Can we just talk about Brook Lopez having the wherewithal to recognize the shot clock was running out and got a quick backwards tip that hit the rim and almost went in.  Really one of the smartest players in the league.
How does Brook Lopez only have 2 rebounds?
Brook Lopez is getting hunted down every play. Why is he still on.
Not play brook lopez?
Brook Lopez really doesn’t bring bucks much value on the court. They should play him less. They don’t need to play him at center.
Is Brook Lopez the worst defensive player of all time
Brook Lopez is single handedly losing this game for the bucks. Never seen worse PnR defense. Wtf am I seeing
Brook Lopez is an absolute liability on d
Definitely costing Brook Lopez.
and you get confused for Brook Lopez
"Also, when they stopped switching before even trying to fight over the screen. And drop coverage with Brook Lopez. That's free for CP3"
"yeah I didnt mind those heat check brook lopez 3 point tries  he was wide open, it's a good look.   you take those looks any possession any day of the week  if he hits two of them it messes up your opponents defense so badly"
"This is strange, I've never seen this take from bucks fans before that Brook is a good rebounder. Having watched him all the way back since Brooklyn, it has been a known weakness of his and he would box out and tip to his teammates because he wasn't confident in securing them for himself. There wasn't a player on the nets that you would prefer to box out for as a seven footer, the safest option is always to secure it yourself as a center.  I am not calling Brook Lopez bad! My favourite players all have areas of the game where they aren't perfect! LeBron is a top 2 all time player and he can't hit free throws, that's just the truth; Fred VanVleet cannot finish at the rim, that's true. All I am saying is that Jarrett Allen is better at catching basketballs out of the air."
"Sorry, what? Brook has always been a bad rebounder, even in Brooklyn. Boxing out is not rebounding. If you're tipping rebounds as a 7 footer, you should be grabbing them. Not everything mildly negative about a player on your team is a slight against them, nothing I said implies Brook is bad. Who gives a shit if he can't rebound when Giannis is there to get them? It does not matter to the bucks winning that Brook is not a rebounder. Why the condescension?  Also, if you watch the bucks play, Lopez is usually in the left corner on offense and the closest he gets to the rim is the dunker's spot. He is coached to not be a rebounder on offense. On defense, well - the excuses might work if he averaged slightly below what centers do, but there's no excuse when it's literally Chris Paul numbers. The number one rebounding skill is getting rebounds! Tipping and boxing out are good skills, but they are not rebounding skills. Passing to a an open man doesn't make you a good shooter, for analogy.  But all I was saying is that Allen is a better rebounder, which is not really controversial"
"Since those 3 are coming, I'd rather replace Beal with a center. Like a real center. Brook Lopez jumps to the front of my mind as a Bucks fan, but someone like him that can fit into multiple different roles, protects the basket, and rebounds well would be a big addition to the team, I think."
"brook helps rim protection but is not an enormous upgrade over bam at that and is worse than bam/draymond at post defense and switching.  unfortunately he may have the worst height-to-rebounding-skill ratio in the league, the guy has averaged *five* a game over the past five years, which is literally the same as 6'0 kyle lowry and chris paul have. Myles Turner is slightly better on the glass but is the same archetype, stretch rim protecting big, below aberage on the glass. If they need pure rebounds they need Allen.  Funnily enough, Russell Westbrook averages more offensive rebounds per game than both Lopez and Turner, which is insane. He averages more boards overall than anyone on team USA including Bam and is the nba assists leader, he might literally be able to play point center for this team lmao"
"Playmaking won't be as glaring of a flaw once they get Booker, Holiday, and Middleton. It's still a weak-point, but it's much better then. I actually think they need a center more. For international ball, I think you need someone with traditional center skills and the willingness to set screens and do the dirty work. Rebounding and rim protection are clearly lacking on this team, too.  As a Bucks fan, I obviously think of Brook Lopez, but there are probably some other good options for that too."
No plumlee is trash they need like Myles turner or Dwight or brook lopez
"Brook Lopez would be a good add. Obviously, my mind goes to Bucks players first, but I think he'd be a good fit on this team with the FIBA rules. He could play more of a traditional center role than he does on the Bucks next to Giannis. He helps out their defense and rebounding a lot, too."
"Ok tell me what rim protectors are available and american, and if your impulse is to say Brook Lopez don't forget that he did jack shit 2 years ago on a worse FIBA team in 9 minutes a game"
Collins doesn’t help their rim protecting big man problem.  Trae is obvious him or Lamelo or Ja.  They need a great passer on this team.  Maybe Myles Turner of Brook Lopez could help the rim protecting.  But it’s one possibly two spots to fill if Grant is also out.
Brook Lopez would be better
"Bet $5 that Dbook would make the first basket in last night’s game, made $45.  I bet $10 that Brook Lopez will score the first basket and that the Suns will win tonight. This will net me $326.  Lopez and the Suns… make it happen."
Can’t Brook Lopez do the same thing for a fraction of the cost? They really need to develop more of an offensive game for KP
The suns don't have a real backup 5 and they're playing Jae Crowder at 4 against Giannis and Bobby Portis. The bucks have Brook Lopez at the 5 who's still very good. Cam Johnson has played well in some minutes but he's a second year player and clearly extremely overmatched when he's played against Giannis. There's no way the bucks wouldn't dominate the boards with the way the teams lineups are.
I mean that's just patently untrue. Brook and Tucker complain to the refs about every single foul. You're right that they don't try to bait a foul then complain when it doesn't happen. But don't act like our team doesn't complain. Lopez and Bud will just berate a ref for like 2 minutes straight when he fucks up.
I mean going from Thon/Henson rotation to Brook Lopez is significant but he made us run blitz which led to open 3s and dunks
everyone knows that Brook Lopez is the batman on the bucks
Absolutely. Brook Lopez is just not good in this matchup. His defense is atrocious and they're aggresively attacking him for easy shots all night.
"Brook Lopez is in the finals, so how can it be boring?"
Forget their health. Their coaching tactics suck too. Deandre Jordan just chilled on the bench while Brook Lopez and Giannis feasted in the paint.
"I was shocked when there was no player to catch it because like Lopez I saw the Suns player jump out with his hands outstretched and I thought it was a Bucks player.  I feel bad for Brook here. Definitely a mistake, but in the heat of the moment with just a split second, I can't blame him for seeing the color/movement and mistaking it for a Bucks player"
"Some players have roles that make them work harder on the court than others. Brook Lopez can play the same minutes, but he's asked to do a lot less.  Giannis scores in a way that takes up a lot of energy, he's accelerating from 0-60 in seconds, he's pushing through contact, he's active and getting in physical battles off-ball, he's *the* fast-break guy so after every rebound he's running to the other end. Defensively the amount of rest he can get varies a lot, but in stretches will be very little - he's fighting against big men trying to score around the rim, he's switching - coming from the perimeter to the paint, playing help defense with emphasis on the help.  40 minutes of what Giannis does is gonna take more energy, and get you more banged up, than 40 minutes of what really any other player on the team does (except maybe Jrue).  Basically, not all 40 minutes are equal. Running sprints is more exhausting than jogging. Also I have a feeling the knee is not making things easy."
Portis isn’t much more mobile than Lopez and is far worse around the rim on both ends. They want Brook to battle with Ayton anyways.
"Only Brook Lopez had a worse +/-, but at least he got to the line and didn’t have 5 turnovers…"
Brook Lopez just has to stop taking 3s. He just can’t hit them this series
"He's a Brook Lopez clone who don't post up, why is he getting crunch time minutes."
Imagine if the bucks didn’t think brook lopez was steph curry
Brook lopez has attemped like 95 3 pt shots and missed all of them
And Brook Lopez will keep backing away with his hands up.
Brook Lopez is just giving layups and missing 3s today Put Portis in for him
Waiting for that brook lopez air ball underneath the hoop.
"I mean health is important tho, and there’s no way to “correct that”. I’m more taking this basketball is trash, these teams lack interest outside of Giannis? who is with some damn g-leaguers. I’ve talked myself into hating brook Lopez just to feel something"
Brook Lopez moment
Bucks should put brook lopez on booker in the second half
brook lopez rocking the electro-girdle
"Really torn   CP3 and Brook Lopez are two of my favorite players, idk who I want to get a ring more, they’ve both been on some brutal teams"
"If brook Lopez passes there, someone should be there"
Brook Lopez went to Stanford. 🤣
Brook Lopez seeing ghosts
"A lot of people don’t know this, but before they played in the NBA, Brook and Robin Lopez had a pretty successful music career. They even had a couple singles chart on the Hot 100.  They called themselves “LMFAO”"
suns fans blaming refs yet let brook lopez beat you down the floor
Can't believe Monty didn't call a timeout after BROOK LOPEZ out-sprinted their entire team.
Brook “the athlete” Lopez
never thought I would see Brook Lopez beat anyone down the court
These playoffs I’ve learnt that Brook Lopez is way more athletic on alley oop finishes than I would have thought
"Brook Lopez has Jae Crowder guarding him and *dribbles around the perimeter.*  I'm rooting for the Bucks in this series, but after watching them in these playoffs, I think my head would have exploded long ago."
I really don’t care too much about who wins but I’ll say it: FUCK BROOK LOPEZ I HOPE HE NEVER WINS A CHIP
"Brook Lopez is just majestic. So graceful, my god."
Why don’t the bucks pass to mismatches some times? Holiday takes a contested layup instead of passing to Brook Lopez being guarded by Cam Johnson in the paint
Jrue absolutely selling on both sides of the floor   Giannis nowhere to be seen  Brook Lopez doing his best Ben Simmons impersonation   ENTER BOBBY
"How are Giannis and Brook Lopez examples of ""deceptive length?"""
I guess the Suns are living with Brook Lopez 3s  Wise choice
Suns seem to be willing to live or die by wide open Brook Lopez 3's
Brook Lopez
"Brook Lopez is not bad as a comparison but more as a budget version of Laimbeer. He's one of those guys you hate if he's not on your team but you can't help but appreciate his skill, his intelligence, and his willingness to put everything on the line to win."
Who do you think his modern comparison is? Maybe Brook Lopez?
"Hi Matt, I have been a Nets fans since their days in New Jersey and having J Kidd, VC and RJ. I have a couple questions regarding the transition into the team we have today that you may or may not be able to bring to light.  1. If there are any in the org that were present during the time of the NJ Nets, what would they say are the best and worst things about a relocation to New Jersey outside of profitability. I understand Bkn is a much more attractive place for free agents and marketing opportunities, but I wanted to understand if there were other things that drove the decision outside of money.  2. Brook Lopez is the Nets all time leading scorer and was traded to the Lakers for DLo and paved the way to being a destination for our super stats today. My question is how did the org feel about making this move and the forecasting of the potential benefits/risks of it. Obviously having a team trade away one of their best players ever for a young star was necessary due to the situation Marks came into, but I am curious as to how people in the org, the team, and Brook himself felt about it. Also, was there a conscious effort to try and bring him back into the org at some point?   3. After the first year of the Kyrie/KD signings with both of them missing all/a majority of the year, Kenny Atkinson left as head coach and has been bouncing around as an assistant ever since. What were the primary factors in that decision, and where did the initial thought of bringing Steve Nash into coaching come into place, was it during the bubble, after the fact, or after the situation with KA was handled.  4. Last one I promise, a lot of the people in the media/NBA orgs note that the Nets are notoriously cautious with their injuries, almost to a fault. My question is what effect did you see on the team regarding the health of players and how much credit do you give the “they’ve only played xyz games together, they obviously won’t succeed when healthy” reasoning for chemistry issues in the NBA. I imagine that players are present and vocal during practices in which they can’t participate, but if there’s anything the common man wouldn’t know that would be great to hear.  Thanks for taking the time out to answer our questions Matt, how to hear from you."
"He has 5 championships *with Tim Duncan* plus other hall of famers.  And no, Larry Brown does not have the most losses, Popavich does. I'm talking about Team USA, not just the Olympics, and I am including exhibitions because they still matter. Pop lost 2 games at the 2019 world championships as well as an exhibition there -- against Australia, of course, plus he's already lost 2 exhibitions here. Here is something else -- he was assistant coach on that 2004 team that lost 3 games and an exhibition.  Plus this team has a much better roster than the 2019 team by far. They had a Plumlee! Even so, that team should have won going away because they still had far more talent than other teams. Also notable, 2004 had Emeka Okafor!  In 2004 the situation was mostly about players not really caring. These days it isn't that. It's partially experience of other teams but Pop also take much blame. In 2019 even though Gobert was dominating them, he still stuck with small ball and they lost. That's on him. He should have had a big in, like Brook Lopez, to counter Gobert."
"1.)  PG: Curry, CP3  SG: Klay, Harden  SF: Durant, Kawhi, Mikal Bridges  PF: Lebron, Draymond, Zion  C: AD, Bam, Brook Lopez  &amp;#x200B;  2.)  PG: Dame, Lonzo  SG: Booker, Jrue   SF: Durant, Mikal Bridges, Middleton  PF: Draymond, Zion  C: Bam, Brook Lopez"
"I think he’s talking more about the D’Lo version of the Nets vs signing KD and Kyrie as Free Agents.   Sean Marks creating a Playoff team in Brooklyn is what lured Free Agents.    Even if the Nets didn’t get Kyrie and Durant I fully believe that the Nets would still be in that 5-8 seed range even without the Play In stuff they added.   Sean Marks flipped Thad Young to the Pacers for a 1st that became Caris LeVert and Pacers owe Nets their 2nd round pick  this year as part of it.   Traded Bojan Bogdanovic to the Wizards at the deadline for a 1st that became Jarrett Allen. Had to take on Andrew Nicholson’s $ that was later traded for Allen Crabbe.   Traded away Brook Lopez to the Lakers and got back D’Lo for taking on Mozgov’s terrible contract.    Even though Marks did make a boneheaded move in taking on Allen Crabbe’s contract without getting “Draft Capital” when Portland didn’t want to pay him anymore. He was still able to dump Andrew Nicholson’s contract to help mitigate the $ since Crabbe was a solid player for the Nets before his knee gave out. Just overpaid because of the massive 2016 Cap bump.   Sean Marks with no control over Brooklyns picks created the Nets core of D’Lo, LeVert, and Allen out of Thad Young, Bojan Bogdanovic, and Brook Lopez. That’s a pretty solid return considering Wizards let Bojan walk after a few months, Lakers let Lopez walk to chase “Stars”, and Thad Young left Indiana for Chicago.   Not to mention hitting on Dinwiddie and Harris who were in the scrap heap."
"2019 was a way worse roster than this one. The roster was Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Joe Harris, Brook Lopez, Middleton, Donovan Mitchell, Mason fucking Plumlee, Marcus Smart, Tatum, Myles Turner, Kemba, and Derrick White. Their best player at the time was Kemba. This team’s best player is Kevin Durant."
What good bigs did we have tho? I looked through the top bigs in the league and most of them are international. Maybe Myles Turner or Brook Lopez?
"Mines is almost identical.   PG: Steph &amp; CP3 is spot on. I have Lonzo in place of lowry for a taller, defensive guard.   SG: I have Klay as a starter, whille Harden will be the 6th man for the offensive firepower, and Jrue.  SF:  Lebron/Durant &amp; Kawhi is spot on. I have Mikal bridges instead of PG as the slasher and dirty work guy. I had PG initially in my mind first though,  PF: I have exactly the same  C: The same besides Jarrett Allen. i had Brook Lopez to space the floor if needed."
I was thinking that Brook Lopez would be perfect for this team. He could stretch out the floor but also dominate the paint.
They needed to build a better roster.   Get the best complimentary players (eg Robert Covington comes to mind) vs all stars to impersonate those guys. And definitely bring in size like a Brook Lopez and Andre Drummond to play big. Having Bam and KD as your biggest on the roster won’t work well.  Any thoughts on better roster construction?
"I mean, there are plenty of energy bigs who can do the ""block shot, get rebound, set screen, get out of the way"" thing. Basically just do a B-/C+ Tyson Chandler impression. Personally I think it would have been funny to send Time Lord to Tokyo, just to see what might happen.  We ought to consider that Colangelo/Krzyzewski/Popovich/whoever else is responsible for these selections communicated some kind of strategic intention or preference when they invited Love. They aren't just picking names out of a hat, there's *some* reason for that decision, however much we all disagree with it. The only plausible basketball reasons I could come up with were shooting, and a history with USA Basketball. That's why I keyed in on Myles Turner, who might be the only player who fits the profile and is eligible to represent the United States.  It really illustrates what a crazy situation this is. More broadly, we're living through this renaissance of skilled big men, you almost can't turn on an NBA game without seeing a seven-footer doing something borderline superhuman, and *NONE* of them are American/eligible to play for Team USA. (Kevin Durant doesn't count, he's 6'13"".) Instead we've got folks in this thread making full-throated endorsements for Jarrett Allen, Mason Plumlee, Brook and Robin(?) Lopez... Jarrett Allen will never in his life be even a tiny fraction of the player that Embiid, Jokic, or Gobert are. Shit, Nic Vucevic would dominate just about every American big.  Maybe it's a good thing though. Up to this point Team USA has really only been capable of doing one of two things: steamrolling everyone, or flaming out in a colossal disappointment. This is one of several major indicators that moving forward, international basketball competition might actually be a fair fight."
"Yeah I agree with everything you said. I think Team USA just takes the consensus best players available, without any consideration for fit.  I literally think having a tough, strong big man who can protect the rim (Robin/Brook Lopez, etc.) would help them more than Lavine and Beal, especially against some of these smaller international teams.  Bottom line, they loaded up on scorers and on ball players, not enough facilitators and defenders, and no overarching structure for the talent to operate in."
Pretty much this.  I'd honestly rather have a team of Dame - Mikal Bridges - Durant - Draymond - Adebayo or Brook Lopez than all 5 all stars
"The revolution started years ago when guys started playing small ball centers so they could have guys playing the 5 who could stretch, shoot and defend. Anybody should have known where we were headed when Brook Lopez came out of the post and went from 2 made 3s in a season to 134."
"Myles Turner is recovering from partial plantar plate tear. Probably better that he sits out and lets that heal. I would have liked to see either Jarrett Allen or Brook Lopez in there, JA because he does all the little things (hard screens, boxes out, fights for boards, rim protects) and Lopez for the spacing and rim protection. It's weird to have Bam and Draymond be the primary (and only) real centers."
On one of the slowest jumpers I’ve ever seen and this is coming from someone that watches Brook Lopez
Brook Lopez was really bad in fiba in 2019
What’s Brook Lopez’ nationality?   But I do agree either way. Center in today’s game is probably has the least ‘stars’ by a good amount
"I subscribe to the idea that everyone can become a decent free throw shooter. No, people don't have to be Steph or Nash. But getting to 70-75% should not be impossible if you're putting in the work. It's literally muscle memory. You do things enough and your body will remember.   There has never been a legitimate argument for why guys can't improve at free throw shooting. The whole ""big hands, too tall"" stuff is just garbage. Ilgauskas shot 67-68% his first few seasons and improved to 78% by the end of his career. Yao shot 80-85% every year other than one. Jokic is 6'11"" and he shoots 83% with this past year being his best yet. Davis is up and down but he still averages 80% over his career. Same with Brook Lopez.   If he's not improving, he needs to find someone to figure out what's going on. Because he's hurting his team by missing that many free throws given how many he shoots a game. He clearly can do it given he's shoot mid 70s before but for whatever reason forgot how to do it these past 2 seasons."
"Yes, he's brook Lopez minus the 3 he scores from time to time"
"The crazy thing about Robert Williams aside from being an advanced stats darling, or his stellar passing especially throwing lobs to others, ability to change the trajectory of almost anyone's shot, and change the time continuum. He's consistently one of the best shot blockers in the game.  He's ranked 9th in the league with 91 blocks per game.  This was something I'm always in awe of, because I was looking at his statistics on BBall-Reference two days ago, and he's ahead of players like Embiid, Giannis, and Jarrett Allen. All players well known for their defensive capabilities/weakside or shot blocking help.  And he's done this in 985 minutes.  |1. Rudy Gobert|2187 MPG|190 blocks| |:-|:-|:-| |2. Myles Turner|1455 MPG|159 blocks| |3. Nerlens Noel|1547 MPG|141 blocks| |4. Clint Capela|1898 MPG|129 blocks| |5. Jakob Poeltl|1845 MPG|123 blocks| |6. Chris Boucher|1453 MPG|111 blocks| |7. Brook Lopez|1902 MPG|103 blocks| |8. Richaun Holmes|1782 MPG|96 blocks| |9. Robert Williams|985 MPG|91 blocks| |18. Giannis Antetokounmpo|2013 MPG|73 blocks| |21. Joel Embiid|1585 MPG|69 Blocks|  What a freakin' beast. If the dude could just stay healthy, he makes us that much better as a team for real."
"Why doesn't Brook Lopez, the largest player in the series, not simply eat the others?"
His foul on Brook Lopez as definitely undeserving.
"You're talking about Robin Lopez now, right? Robin Lopez is Brook Lopez's Robin Robin Lopez?"
But what would they be without Brook “Alfred” Lopez?
NBA Centers with the last name Lopez with cool nicknames:  Tier 1: Robin “Captain Hook” Lopez Tier 2: Brook “Splash Mountain” Lopez  *Tier list based on coolness of nicknames not basketball skill*
"I knew we were losing this game, the Bucks are very good and it was must win for them. It shocked me that we started off that good with Booker in his worst night of the year (I am extremely afraid he might be injured given Monty also pulled him in game 2 just so he doesn't play a fucking 1 extra minute, but it might be me making excuses for my favorite player), but the Bucks made their runs in the spots they had to, had some positive variance, and took a huge momentum boost of a win.  I do not think the Bucks got the Suns ""figured out"". The Suns go as far as their best player, Devin Booker, takes them, and he took them nowhere last night. I am still confident we can get game 4. This to me is a ""good for them"" game, like game 3 vs the Clippers was. The big difference is Giannis Sina-Ugo Antetokounmpo. He's too good, too big, too fast, too strong, AND for the first time in his playoff career, he gets the 50-50 calls instead of being screwed for being too big. Unfortunate (and curious) timing for it to happen.  Monty is a great pre-planner. So he just needs to figure things out. I think he thought Bud would play the shot-quality game and go with the game 2 game plan, but with the way they limited corner three attempts we went with plan B, which is more Ayton and more above the break threes to get that shot gravity back. Other than Crowder, everyone missed everything. We were still great from midrange, but that's just what we do. Jrue ""50% true shooting"" Holiday hitting 5/10 threes sucks, but good for him for responding after all the shit he's gotten this playoff run.  If there's one huge non-Giannis problem, is the offensive boards. Bucks are great at them. Other than that, I remain convinced that we can win this series, especially since Bud is allergic to playing Brook Lopez big minutes.   Shout out to my guy Cam Johnson. If Book isn't injured and he just played like shit, then it's time to bounce the fuck back, split the away games and come in to a roaring PHX Suns Arena."

"&gt; what has only happened twice is repeating that performance in back to back playoff games  Yes, because that's what we are doing here? Playing a series of games back to back. The fact that there are so few basketball legends that have ever done it back to back should tell you what you need to know about just how high a level of performance it is, and how unreasonable it is to expect it to continue. Good players have off nights, and the Bucks cannot afford to have anyone on their team have an off night from here on out.   &gt; Not sure how a player averaging 40 against you when you just lost by 20 is confidence inspiring  Because the Suns won on Sunday when Giannis had virtually the exact same stat line? What this demonstrates is that they only need to shut down Holiday and/or Middleton. They could double team both of those guys and man up on Brook Lopez, leaving PJ Tucker and Giannis to try and win the game. We have already seen that Giannis basically cannot win the game by himself, so just bottle up the weaker players and let Giannis have his monster box scores. Since the Bucks only have three players who are a threat, the Suns can cause real problems for them on defense if they are active and not giving the Bucks core open looks."
"&gt; He also proved his unguardable regardless of the talent around him against the Bucks this season  He was playing 1 on 1 with Brook Lopez relax lol Steph, healthy Harden, Kawhi would have dominated lopez too."
"I would be surprised if the double team doesn't show up for the remainder of the series.   The Bucks only have three weapons on the court at any one time. If I'm the Suns, I'm doubling up on Giannis, manning up on Holiday and Middleton and making PJ Tucker and Brook Lopez beat me."
"""Hello police, this is Brook Lopez.  Chris Paul tryin to get in the bathroom stall - come save me"""
"Mate, the Suns have a plethora of guards and wings and one fucking centre, DA. Saric is the closest they had to a second C.  And don't be a fkn idiot, if you have the following 5 Starters, Jrue Holliday, Chris Middleton, Donte Divincenzo, Giannis Antetokounpo, Brook Lopez. Very obviously one of those guys is the least important starter.   Any other Suns bench player is easily replaceable EXCEPT Saric. That makes him vital to the team. They are literally playing centreless without him.  The most replaceable Bucks starter is Donte. Who, as this thread points out, no one even notices he's missing."
"You shoulda been there for the Bucks Lakers game in 2019. Giannis and LeBron were both out for load management. The ball got stuck on top of the backboard and nobody has any clue what to do, so Brook Lopez grabs one of the floor mop things and bats the ball out and it was the loudest the crowd got all night lmao."
"Since the Bucks have only three real threats on the floor at any given time, I'm double teaming Giannis with Crowder and Ayton, then going man on Holiday and Middleton and forcing  PJ Tucker and Brook Lopez to beat me."
"Ayton put up 18 points in 26 minutes. That disparity is affected by him being in foul trouble, hence the complaint. Think Bucks paint dominance wouldn't be diminished if Giannis was pulled from the game due to foul trouble? Who knows, maybe Brook Lopez bullies the Suns like he did the Hawks. Doubt we'll ever see Giannis in foul trouble to find out..."
"Curry is a team defender. It’s easy for him to look good on D when he has plenty of good defenders. Klay, Iggy, Draymond and KD aren’t bad defenders. LeBron hunted him 2016 and Kyrie cooked him too. Giannis has to cover up for his teammates. Guys like Bryn Forbes, Brook Lopez and Portis for example are worse than Curry’s teammates on D. Basketball is a two way sport. I’m guessing you have Curry over Kawhi too since his offense is “on another solar system”."
I mean Giannis has the hardware to back it up with a less stacked team but I can see there is no convincing you. The way you value Curry’s impact on offense is the same way I value Giannis on defense. His versatility alone allows the Bucks to get away with tons of things they shouldn’t. Like playing Brook Lopez or going small when necessary. I like Curry too but I think Giannis is a better two way player than Curry.   Also the Suns walled up against LeBron when they saw the Lakers had no shooting. I’d rather take my chances LeBron hits a deep 3 than him muscling his way into the paint for an easy basket.
"Ben Simmons in the 80s would be ridiculous. I think Joe Dumars would be really good nowadays, same with Bill Lambier who’d basically just be Brook Lopez with attitude.  Kenny Smith would honestly be a solid PG now since he had size and shooting ability, I could see a something like Will Barton in him.  DWade would be fantastic in today’s faster and more spacious game."
Still trips me out Brook Lopez is the Nets all time leading scorer. Dude been underrated for over a decade
"its a shame they couldn't get brook lopez on team USA, he deserves a medal and also he's better than kevin love"
brook lopez had cam payne on him and he was the only one to recognize it on the bucks
When Brook Lopez watched the finals every year with his family what big man did he see throwing up 3s any chance they got?!
"Yeah but I just mean in terms of overall skill. Like Brook is asked to do something specific and doesn’t play inside as much as he maybe should, but he can do inside, outside, defend, etc.  Ayton can do a lot too, but he’s asked only to play to his strengths. So his stats and advanced stats will look better than Lopez. But I think it’s an interesting case."
"No, Brandon Jennings was DRAFTED by the Bucks with the 10th pick, they had to use him to acquire Middleton. Giannis was DRAFTED by the Bucks. Jrue Holiday was traded for DRAFT picks.  Without the draft the Bucks best player is Brook Lopez. The Lakers would have LeBron and the Nets would have KD/Kyrie.  Honestly, at this point I am gonna assume you are trolling."
"Yes. Not all superteams are good.   Deron Williams, KG, Joe Johnson, Brook Lopez, Paul Pierce.  Hakeem, Drexler, Barkley.   Shaq, Kobe, Malone, Payton.   Melo, Westbrook, PG.   Kobe,Nash,Dwight."
&gt; Harden/AD/George are never forcing their way to Milwaukee. The Bucks established two home grown stars before they took a huge risk in Holiday (A lesser tier star). A Brook Lopez free agent signing is no where near the level of LeBron or KD.
Harden/AD/George are never forcing their way to Milwaukee. The Bucks established two home grown stars before they took a huge risk in Holiday (A lesser tier star). A Brook Lopez free agent signing is no where near the level of LeBron or KD.
"Fair enough, I don't really think his size is bad for a 19 year old 7-footer, if you look at similar players coming into the league from the last I don't think he looks any worse.  Maybe playing him at PF could be good while he puts on some more size, but considering how important spacing is in today's NBA having a long term plan of Mobley at PF and a traditional C like Jarret Allen seems like a disaster.  Maybe if they got a center who could be on the perimeter on offense, like a Giannis/Brook Lopez situation, I could see it more"
"Just having people willing to shoot is important. Brook Lopez is like a 31% shooter but defenses still worry about him because ""he provides spacing"".   The Lakers are literally full of guys who don't shoot well and hardly even try so why try defending them on the perimeter when fucking LeBron is your best 3pt shooter"
Had to remedy the mistake Mitch made by trading away DLO to get rid of mozgov. Only bad move was not bringing brook Lopez back
Can you name a specific guy the Lakers could have gotten/kept and didn't? The only ones that come to mind for me are Brook Lopez and Danny Green
Psh. Dude got carried by Brook Lopez
Brook Lopez would fit.
"Didn’t the Bucks just get Jrue Holiday last year and Brook Lopez played on the Bucks for only 3 years, he was on the Nets for a decade. If anything teams like the Hawks are the ones you should be cheering for"
exactly. the reality is that big isn't coming out of the paint so your 5 better be ready to shoot and make good on that threat. Few guys will actually do that. Brook Lopez does at time. Marc Gasol did for a while until he gave it up. Mostly it's just a big pump faking and then doing a hand off with a guard. Pretty useless
"Imagine if they had a center that can take the load off AD and stretch the floor, someone like Brook Lopez, can't quite picture him in a Lakers jersey tho"
"Imagine if they had a center that can take the load off AD and stretch the floor, someone like Brook Lopez, can't quite picture him in a Lakers jersey tho"
"The Pacers trading for Ben would be more indicative of them keeping Turner than Sabonis imo, which I don’t really agree with. Ben doesn’t fit very well with either of them but Turner is at least more of a floor spacer, a necessity for any big Simmons is paired with.   That’s really his biggest problem, any team that wants to pair Simmons with another big is diminishing the skillset of the big due to Simmons inability to create any shot outside of the paint, he either needs to function as a small ball 5 or play with a great stretch 5 like Giannis and Brook Lopez. This is one reason I think he’d fit well with Minnesota and KAT, but even in that scenario I don’t like the idea of KAT’s offensive role becoming Cleveland Kevin Love sitting out at the 3 point line, he’s a great 3 point shooter but it’s only one positive aspect of his game not the primary strength of it."
"I’m strictly going to talk offense here because he is obviously a perimeter defender and very switchable so basically 1-4 position-less.   People will say he needs to be a “power forward” but the truth is he needs to play offense with the ball in his hands.  If you take the ball out of his hands and give it to someone else, you lose like 75 percent of the things he provides offensively.  The modern power forward needs to be able to shoot and space the floor, especially if you have a center on the team who occupies the middle of the court. That’s why the sixers play(ed) him at Point guard on offense. Joel occupies the post, and the only real other option is to have him be able to drive to the basket and make plays for others with the ball in his hands. People who play off the ball need to be able to shoot.   Now on another team, I think the current version of Ben Simmons would be at his best with someone like Brook Lopez or Miles Turner at Center. Someone who can play defense at the 5 but can play an off-ball shooter on offense. In this situation, Ben would be more like Giannis, but with more playmaking than scoring. I would classify him as a point forward in this role, because I still think you need a combo guard next to him to have the ball in the final few minutes of the game (until he improves his free throw shooting). I could see Ben getting 18-10-10 consistently in a system like this and being successful in a playoff setting."
"He is, but he's also a big who likes the ball and does the most damage in the paint.  KAT'd be great in the Brook Lopez role camped out at the 3-point line, but that's wasting his talent."
"Imagine Luka at the center of Steph, Seth, Klay, and Brook Lopez. 150 PPG"
Robin and brook lopez: WWE tag team champions
"Turner does not shoot well enough to give Zion spacing. That's not a nock on Turner though, there are maybe 3 centers in the league that teams will choose to guard on the perimeter while leaving Zion 1on1 in the paint.  The other problem with Turner is he does not grab defensive rebounds and that is a weakness for Zion. Pairing them together will allow teams to feast on offensive rebounds, killing their defense.   Adams best attributes were screening, rebounding and bodying bigs, all things that helped Zion out as much if not more than Turner's 1.5 threes a game would.   Adam got killed by mobile guards however and that hurt us. Part of that was on our very unrelaible guard defense, part of that was on Adams' immobility.  Adams also posed 0 offensive threat so teams weren't punished for ignoring him.  JV brings almost everything Adams did but is more mobile. He will be ignored by opposing defenses, but unlike Adams JV will score 20-30 points if he's left alone. So would Turner. But, at least for me with this team I value rebounds and physicalty more than blocks and 3 pointers. JV has the advantage on Turner there.  JV also has potential to hit a few 3s. He shot 37% on 1 attempt per game last year. Obviously Turner is better and likely will always be a better shooter, but JV has the building blocks to turn into a Brook Lopez. But, even if he does he will still be ignored on the 3 point line.  Zion won't see real spacing in his career unless the Pelicans get, KAT, Jokic, Steph or Dame or someone who turns into those guys. Zion is just too efficient in the paint."
"People forget he averages 20/9/9 when Embiid is out for his career with DPOY level defense. On the right team with a Center like Brook Lopez or Myles Turner, he is super valuable."
Shoutout Brook Lopez. That 33 point game was so crucial without Giannis.
World Champion Brook Lopez has a nice ring to it
"He fouls like crazy, can’t defend anybody with size, has zero inside game, and gets paid like he’s prime Brook Lopez.  Oh I forgot he’s a below average rebounder too"
Lots of teams with a non-shooter looking for a 5 who can become a Brook Lopez type
"Yeah Kd's volume has gone up by a couple, but his % has stayed the same. He was always an elite 3 point shooter. Kobe was not.  For every Brook Lopez there are a 100 Andre Drummonds. Drummond was drafted several years after Lopez too. Your game is your game."
"That's bs. Look at KDs stats even though he's scoring average has gone down from before 2015, he's 3pt volume has going up. LeBron made tremendous improvement to his 3pt volume and %. Then you have players like Brook Lopez who completely developed one. Not all players adjust, but the great ones do."
Actually shit you're right Brook Lopez exist lmao
"Legit though, KD and Jrue looked like the best bigs out there.  Bam was just not the choice for this team. Someone in the game thread said Brook Lopez would be a better choice and I don't disagree."
I think Brook Lopez would have brought a lot more to Team USA than Draymond Green
Any halfway decent big could play well against him.  I’m pretty sure the same season that Robin Lopez killed him was the first season Brook Lopez was starting to shoot 3s because I have a strong memory of Brook stretching the floor and dropping them all over Dre.  Dude was a huge disappointment and thinks he’s better than he is.  After all the back injuries Dwight had to accept the player he was and became a useful player on a championship team.  Hopefully it doesn’t take Dre getting injured to realize he’s just a role player.
"Giannis' ability to dribble and pass in and of itself disproves this whole argument. Just as height gives you an advantage on the boards, it also gives you disadvantages in skill moves.   A 6'0 point guard with a lower center of gravity and smaller arms is naturally  going to have a much easier time running, moving laterally, and dribbling the ball than a 7 footer would.  The fact that Giannis is incredibly fast and agile with the ball *despite* his size shows that he'd probably be *even better* at handling if he was 6'0 instead of 6'11. And since Giannis did not come into the league as a rookie with that level of talent it means he worked extremely hard to perfect the *skill* of ball handling.  Obviously Brook Lopez will never be as naturally gifted as Giannis. Just like Smush Parker was never as naturally gifted as Allen Iverson. Who cares? Giannis still put the time in the gym to be able to make himself a big who can dish and handle the rock--a skill that he's naturally disadvantaged at."
"Robin ""Batman"" and Brook ""Robin"" Lopez. Have you ever seen them in the same place at the same time?"
"&gt; Hate to break it to you, but Giannis has a better FT% than LeBron in the last 3 years. He's better than Giannis at 3, but only at 35% (still shoots the fuck you threes though). In no universe can LeBron ""shoot"" like you're talking about.   Holy shit you're not actually going to sit here and try to tell me they are comparable shooters.  Goddamn   &gt; If you also put him in an ""average NBA body"", he won't have the elite vision for passing you're talking about.   How the hell would making him an 1 inch shorter take away his vision.  Of course his overall passing benefits from his athleticism, but Lebron has absolutely elite vision regardless  &gt; Also, I don't know why you say he's ""gifted"" with his body when he's worked on it every day of his adult life.   I really shouldn't have to explain how Giannis is gifted physically.  He's 7 feet tall and runs like a gazelle.  You can't teach that, and you can't learn that.   &gt; Giannis works everyday to keep his body in that shape.  ...and the other top players don't? You think he worked extra hard to grow to 7 feet and move like that?  Brook Lopez could drink from the fountain of youth and do agility drills for 1,000 years straight and still wouldn't move like that."
"The expectations really aren't the problem, it's the fact that his role constantly keeps changing:  * His rookie year the Lakers had Brook Lopez, Julius Randle, Larry Nance Jr, and Brandon Ingram in the front court, so they asked Kuzma to fill in mostly as a backup 3, with a little 4.  * His second year they only had Javale at center, no longer had Randle or Nance and now had LeBron to go with Ingram, so Kuzma was asked to mostly play 4 with some backup 5.  * His third year the Lakers had Dwight and Javale at center, AD at center and PF and LeBron at SF, so Kuzma was in a vastly reduced role trying to fill in wherever he could, even sometimes at 2.  * It would have been more of the same this year, just with Gasol, Drummond and Trez at center, but LeBron and AD were hurt, and the Lakers had Markieff Morris and Wesley Matthews as well, so Kuzma's role again was all over the place.  I think if Kuzma was on a team where he could play more consistent 3/4 minutes (where he wasn't backing up All NBA guys at those positions), then he'd really blossom. I honestly don't think the spotlight or expectations bother him, I just think it has to be tough to know what the team needs him to do when whatever that role is is constantly changing."
"Lol god that's just as stupid.  Quit trying to act like being 7 foot means you have the same physical advantages as Giannis does.  You think Brook Lopez was born with the same gifts as Giannis?  He's 7 foot, right?   Giannis is the least skilled top player in the league.  I would love to see an argument for who else it could be, you would have to go way to down the list of top guys.  He also happens to be the most physically dominant player in the league, and he's among the most physically dominant players ever.    Give the guy credit for being a seemingly amazing person, who worked super hard on his body, and utilizes the gifts he was born with.  But it's crazy to me people try and talk like he's somehow skilled compared with these other top players.  He's not, he's an absolute freak athletically who takes advantage of being bigger faster and stronger than almost everyone he plays."
Brook Lopez on the court is already a fail. Lebron Ad pnr gets Lopez switched onto Lebron and PJ on Ad.
Brook Lopez will pass Larry Bird for career threes next season.

"Ah shit I had a whole response that I guess didn’t get through, my bad!  Alright so to respond to one thing: if you are saying you don’t think the gap between the overall USA talent pool and the rest of the world is huge, I just completely disagree. Giannis, Luka, Jokic, Embiid, and Gobert are all star international players, but none of them have even a 2nd star on their roster. Their teams perform well in the olympics for that exact reasons- because they play together all the time and are actually a team. If you took Giannis off this years Bucks squad, and just ran their all american lineup of Middleton-Jrue-Brook Lopez- Connaughton- Pj Tucker, that team would dominate the Olympics. It’s just that this USA team had a really shortened window to practice because of Covid/ the NBA season being pushed back.  I don’t understand the point you are trying to make about Dame and KD. Yes they are superstar players, and while I don’t necessarily think Tatum will be as good as KD 4 years from now, it’s not at all crazy to think that some combination of 2 of any of these young USA guys will 4 years from now be as good as Dame/ KD. Also worth pointing out that the Olympic team is struggling in large part because Dame and KD are playing awful, so I don’t see the logic in saying a different version without them is automatically better.  Anyways, in a larger sense, if the USA sends a full or even semi full team in 2024, we will absolutely dominate. This years team is missing so many key guys: Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Lebron James, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis…. which is literally maybe the best starting 5 we can roll out overall.  I’m not sure exactly what point you are trying to make. The USA is still by far the most talented Olympic team, despite how poorly we’ve played, and you not seeing why a different team 4 years from now can be better than this does not make any sense to me. If that 2024 team develops and everyone wants to play, it could be an all time great roster. Who knows though, obviously just speculation at this point."

A Brook Lopez role is a terrible fit for JV
Can he shoot 3s? Feel like Zion needs a Brook Lopez type 5 while he plays the Giannis role.
"One of them (Brook Lopez) just won the championship, so I'm super happy. The rest of the guys are pretty eh, but I think a dude from this year is projected to get drafted in the top 10-15 so that's cool too."
"I didn't watch that much, but look at freaking Brook Lopez. That's a 7 footer that developed a knock down 3 point shot very late in his career.   Matisse already shot decently in his rookie year when he had better spacing, this year his role was reduced so his numbers went down, except for his 2pt shot, he shot 59% which is great.   I'm sure he can be close to an average offensive guy and you don't need more if he's doing what he's doing on defense."
I thought he was trying to spell brook lopez
Im seeing some people suggest maybe he could play a Brook Lopez type role on offense.  You have to respect his shot more than Adams...every inch of space helps.
"Shit, may as well have kept Adams if that’s how it works. Just turn him into Brook Lopez, easy."
"I wouldn't call Brook Lopez a volume shooter either.  Zion was good on Defense in College I think he'll be fine.  Ingram is tall and I've actually seen him bother some people on D.  Jrue is such a better ball handler and team leader than Lonzo, I see it more likely that Lonzo gets traded and they go hard for Kyle Lowry"
Brook Lopez is an elite paint defender
i do think the offensive fit isn’t bad. we’ll see if he becomes that kind of brook lopez esque guy
I'm excited about what JV can be offensively.  I think the Pelicans want to do what Milwaukee did with Brook Lopez. JV has a pretty good shooter's touch. They could have him spot up on the perimeter and shoot more 3s.  It would provide incredible spacing and the lane would be wide open for Zion.  Can't do that with Adams.
Right?  They'll play him like Brook Lopez and let Zion be Giannis.  The molded it after the bucks who's their new Jrue Holiday?

"For the Pelicans, getting off of the Bledsoe/Adams contracts is enough incentive to take a flyer on JV and see what he can do.  On a championship team, the best you hope for from JV is a Brook Lopez type role. So now the challenge for the Pels is adding that extra star next to Zion."
Great trade for the pelicans. JV fits way better with Zion. Bledsoe is off the books along with Adam’s now. Doesn’t seem like a great move for Memphis since it doesn’t really improve them where they already are. Not horrible tho as Bledsoe can be good. Seems like Adams is also trying to be a stretch given recent reports like a brook lopez like player. Memphis good talent scouts so maybe they really like someone this draft that can be an instant rotation piece. Interesting trade none the less
"Brooklyn's biggest weakness is their lack of size, which is why they leaned heavily into their biggest strength in the playoffs, which was spreading the floor with shooters and letting their big dogs cook. Milwaukee was able to beat them because of their huge size advantage... and injuries.... Anyways, their size and versatility paid dividends against a small Brooklyn team. None of Blake Griffin, Jeff Green or KD shouldn't be playing center in the playoffs against either Brook Lopez or Giannis.  &amp;#x200B;  I don't know the exact FA pool, but I'm sure a decent center would be willing to take the MLE from Brooklyn in order to compete.  &amp;#x200B;  And yeah I agree Joe Harris sucked in game 7 especially, but he's still a great shooter, and I think he'll step it up next year. If not, the talent of KD Harden and Kyrie is still more than capable of winning it for them."
"Ayton usually had one of, if not both of, Giannis and Brook Lopez guarding him. Maybe he did run out of gas, but I think there was a pretty big difference in the players defending against him in the finals."
"Eh, love Steven but I'll believe it when I see it.  He's a career 55% FT shooter who saw a pretty big decline last season (.444 from .582 the season before :/).    Generally when you see a big develop an outside shot, they were a solid FT shooter all along (e.g. Brook Lopez who averaged ~75-80% for years before starting to shoot the three), it would be pretty unprecedented IMO if Adams started knocking it down from deep.  Would love to see it though."
Brook Lopez is Kronk
"Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, not sure he is eligible but Ayton, also if you have AD and Bam on your team i’m pretty sure you can make do with Draymond too"
"Honestly, it's a bit overblown. When you look closer, you can see the cracks. Bobby derives pleasure from imagining other players slapping his mother. Giannis invaded and conquered Greece with other members from his tribe. Holiday does nothing but steal peoples cookies, as can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1Ui40MVOHE). Tucker is purposefully buying and wearing out expensive sneakers so that others don't get to enjoy them. Lopez has a twin brother and Brook is clearly the evil one.  Connaughton is Irish, it's just not right."
I think they should have taken Jarrett Allen and/or Brook Lopez
You could just also be thinking of them in bucks alternate jerseys from last year.   https://www.si.com/.image/t_share/MTY4MDI0NjU3NjM3ODExNDcz/bucks-khris-middleton-brook-lopez-nba-playoffsjpg.jpg  https://www.fiba.basketball/api/img/team/coverimage/5/208179/27/550/418
Team USA really could have used Brook Lopez in the paint
Brook Lopez probably fits since they dont wanna play too many minutes for slow big men it seems lol
"Other than Brook Lopez and the checked out Kevin Love, what healthy and available American big man can shoot 3's?"
"KAT was born in New Jersey, but he’ll probably never play for team USA  Outside of him, probably Bam or Brook Lopez"
You must not watch them enough. Lopez on rim protection allows Giannis to roam and not have to guard centers. Bobby and Giannis would be wasted if they didn't have Brook. And Bobby would be destroyed by the bigger centers of the league. He's also super useful if Giannis goes down.
Ya people keep bringing up Randle and I feel like he's made redundant on this roster by better players.   Wish we would have reached out to Brook Lopez or someone like that. McGee and Love shouldn't have been considered
"Randle would be an awful fit for this team. Undersized and ball dominant. Not a great shooter or defender. Love was an awful decision (only remote benefit is his shooting) but that doesn't mean Randle would have been a good choice.   A prime DeAndre Jordan is what we need. Defend, board and finish around the rim not needing the ball in their hands. McGee kinda fits that but I agree it's embarrassing that an Olympic squad has a player of his caliber considering it's America.   We should have reached out to Brook Lopez or someone like that instead."
"Miami or Philly. I feel like him and Bam complement each other’s game so well, and they Miami would have enough cap to get some good depth and S5 power around those two if they let go of guys like Jimmy Butler, Gordon Dragic, and Trevor Ariza they could even get a lot more. A starting 5 I think would push the heat up top would be this  PG-Malcom Brogdan SG-Bradley Beal SF-Davis Bertans PF-Bam Adebeyo C-Brook Lopez"
Brook Lopez literally is in the league and won a title
Brook Lopez also shot below 70% from the line as a college freshman
"This season, March 27th Bucks/Knicks.  Every Bucks starter except for Brook Lopez was out, and the Knicks were playing without two of their better/best players.  Most of the Bucks team were less than a month from the G-league, and a motley crew of 2nd round picks and undrafted players. I think five players on the team set a career high for points.  Thanasis ran point guard and finished 23/10/5 with 2 steals. It was [glorious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LX1yxM-HD8&amp;t=174s). Knicks won, but it was one of the funniest, silliest games I've ever seen."
Brook Lopez averaged 2.6 pts (22% FG 16% 3FG) in 9.4 minutes in 2019 World Cup.
Better than Adams and most other centers in the league. That Brook Lopez territory. It’s good enough since not every center can shoot like KAT
"yeah i mean you're comparing laimbeer to 3 of GOAT centers... hakeem olajuwon for example, even beyond his position, can be argued to be a top 5 player of all time. if bill laimbeer can make it as a starter in today's USA national team, then that says a lot about today's NBA. like you said, it especially speaks of the drought of US-big men in the NBA. their best big men are international players.  for sure a shortened offseason should be factored in, but the whole world faced complications against the pandemic. a lot of international players also play in the NBA, so it's an even handicap imo.  i watched the USA vs France game in 2019 (check it out if you haven't), and it seems like the common denominator is your last point.. most of them are ""superstars"" on their team and don't know how to really play team-ball as a consequence. their teams are structured in a way where the team revolves around them as a center piece. now all those players come together thinking they're the justice league, when really they're just confused on how to play together.  so yes, these players are individually athletically talented, more than previous generations. their talents, however, are capped- They lack the talent of being able to play on any team. Guys in previous Olympic teams knew how to play with each other, despite not being on the same team... and that talent is more important in team sports, like basketball. This isn't tennis.. sometimes basketball is like tennis, when you're playing 1-on-1. Too bad there isn't a 1-on-1 professional league watched by millions of viewers on television. These guys would excel at it.  the problem is, everyone wants to be ""jordan,"" yet even jordan wasn't the leading scorer of the dream team. he played his ROLE.. and they let charles barkley do most of the scoring because his body/strength/basketball ability was kryptonite for every other team. they all served their roles and no one tried to be a star, most of them never played with each other, but gel'd immediately. maybe it's just the culture that's in the states right now, everybody wants to be ""That guy,"" but the real ""that guy""s knew how to do it all, and that's what US kids aren't seeing. Even watching the Redeem Team.. man they were ferocious on the court and playing beautiful team ball. Kobe wasn't even the leading scorer, but again, like Jordan, he played his role.  &amp;#x200B;  i'm sure if the team consisted of Lebron/Steph/Klay/Durant/Draymond/Myles Turner/Dwight Howard/Brook Lopez/Jrue Holiday/Kawhi Leonard.. they'd be beating everybody. First, 4 of them have played together on the same team. Second, LeBron can fit on any team because his game is like Magic Johnson's, he just fits on any team. Dwight Howard is old but he's tough now, plays bully bull on his limited minutes, and he played on the Redeem Team like LeBron. Myles Turner and Brook Lopez are the only American-born Centers who are better than all the other American Centers who have been in it for 5+ years. Myles Turner is a liability because he would've gotten destroyed by Gobert (see footage of Pacers vs Jazz games). It's sad that team USA would have to have him as a Center because he's young/has more stamina than Brook and Dwight, but doesn't have an aggressive rebounding nature against REAL centers. Rotate minutes. Jrue Holiday knows how to play proper defence and is a team player. Klay is one of the NBA's elite defenders. Kawhi, elite defender. If you had Jrue, Klay, Kawhi, Draymond, and Dwight Howard all on the floor at the same time.. It's gonna be a loooooong day for all the opposing teams.  &amp;#x200B;  finally, no disrespect to popovich, but these lineups have been questionable (even the plays ran in the 2019 game). i don't know if he's the right coach for this team"
"If you got a team full of superstars you ain't gonna have people filling the holes. Not every star can be an all around player like LeBron and trying to win with 5 steph currys is gonna go bad no matter how good those currys are. A team with Brook Lopez, PJ Tucker, Middleton, Jrue and KD would do a lot better that 5 scoring first superstars."
"Damn, even Ayton is foreign? I guess Brook Lopez is the only all-start level non-foregn center we have left (besides Bam)"
Man. Is this true? Brook Lopez is the second best Center in the USA? That just doesn’t look right.
"We got team basketball in the NBA, but it's usually superstars with teammates covering their weakness. If you got a team full of superstars you ain't gonna have people filling the holes. Not every star can be an all around player like LeBron and trying to win with 5 steph currys is gonna go bad no matter how good those currys are. A team with Brook Lopez, PJ Tucker, Middleton, Jrue and KD would do a lot better that 5 scoring first superstars."
Bottom tier of greatness if anything.  He's always been a liability on defense and his team's primarily lost hence the inflated numbers. Efficiency and winning translates to greatness. I think he is very skilled offensively and his game sense got much better but give me Brook Lopez even over peak cousins.
Turner is in trade talks every off-season. He is the new Brook Lopez
I don't get why nobody talks about fucking Brook Lopez. He is perfect for that format.
How about getting an actually good player like Brook Lopez to do that? Then maybe Golbert would dunk on them like 50000 times in a row.
"that comment is so misleading lmao. Fiba world cups are so different compared to the oympics where US can bring its best roster. That tournament you mentioned where they finished 7th, had some guys like brook lopez, derrick white, joe harris, harrison barnes clearly not the best roster lmao. Your insane if you don’t believe this roster rn has the potential with better coaching and chemistry to dominate this tournament. I see i international fans always say look at this obscure tournament or exhibition and say see the US isn’t good when there roster is horrible. This was the first olympic loss since 2004, the oympics are the only tournament US actually cares about lmaoo. Compared to past oympics other international teams should still be considered pushovers, they have played teams way better then this france or nigerian teams for example. There are plenty of problems with this roster and USA basketball but actual quality of players isn’t it, ppl love to shit on the US but in reality they could very realistically win gold lmao"
Brook Lopez could've been helpful. Boogie was as good as Embid and Joker before his body fell apart.
"I'm pretty sure the best pure Center in the league who is only eligible to play for USA is either Brook Lopez or Jarrett Allen.   Obviously AD playing Center would be the best, but still that's kinda crazy to think about."
"It’s the little extra   Idk if he is what they need.  Pj Tucker, Danny Green, brook Lopez, Roco … low usage role players who can shoot 3s and just defend.      You don’t need KD, Dame, Booker, Levine, Tatum..plus originally Beal.      You need 3 of them so that roles can be sorted out."
Should’ve been Brook Lopez
"Ehh you're overestimating the effects. He would definitely see a jump, but it wont be huge. Like Giannis averaged 27 ppg the year before and after we got Brook Lopez, who unlocked our spacing. In 2018 we were running lineups with Bledsoe and John Henson. People tend to overestimate the effects of spacing, and use bad examples who can actually be used to show the minimal effects of spacing. Will the team be better and more efficient? No doubt. But hard to see Zion's individual production being drastically affected by spacing when he's already unstoppable"
What decent centers were available? Drummond or Brook Lopez? AD was hurt and guys like Zion are too small. Most of the best big men in the league nowadays are international players.
Brook Lopez chilling at Disney world
Brook Lopez is good
"Because the 2019 roster was even worse? Their best player was Kemba Walker and they were rolling out guys like Mason Plumlee, Brook Lopez, Kyle Kuzma, and Derrick White."
Brook Lopez would have been perfect.
still sounds like he's going to end up being higher on Myles Turner and Brook Lopez types than I would probably be. But its a start. The Fake Stretch 5 movement is gaining mucho momentum
"I honestly think you are going to see Jonas completely flip into Brook Lopez type player on offense - a stretch 5 when Zion is on the court, and a post player when Zion is off the court.  that was THE biggest move of the offseason for Pels and you'll see that happening from the start of season.    They really need Schroder to run point and play solid perimeter Defense. Graham should be off the bench 6th man like Quickley on the Knicks.   I threw him into the starting 5 for the name value but actually Pelicans would be better off with:  Schroder, NAW, Ingram, Zion, Jonas \[starters\] + Graham as 6th man"
"100% this. Is JV a better outside shooter than Adams? Sure, but JV still takes less than one 3-pt attempt per game, so it's not exactly like he's Brook Lopez."
"He does. Even when he plays with Brook Lopez, Lopez usually stays around the 3 point line and Giannis plays in the paint."
"Brook Lopez has valuable floor stretching that giannis doesn’t have, so yeah in part it’s probably that."
I too have positive memories of brook lopez
"Pretty sure Brook Lopez leads a bunch of franchise categories for the Nets lol  Not for long, but still"
"It’s absolutely Jason Kidd. Brook Lopez is the leading scorer because of longevity. In the NBA, Kidd has been the greatest Net. Took a 26-win team to back-to-back NBA finals and created a culture of winning that lasted until the team decided to not spend any money while being lame ducks in NJ.   If KD brings a championship to BK, he’s the greatest Net but so far he’s only played one season. We can’t go crowning him yet."
"Y'all making me feel like I just have Stockholm Syndrome, having positive memories of Brook Lopez lol"
RIP Brook Lopez
He's no Brook Lopez.
He is the greatest basketball player to play for the Nets. But he isn't the greatest Net. Lopez did way more for the nets than KD did in a single injury riddled season. But of course KD is leagues ahead of Brook and it is only a matter of time.
It's because he's a shit defender and can't rebound. He'd be a worse Brook Lopez on offense and a negative defender unlike Brook
"I looked up the team records. Many Buck Williams, a few Kidd, and a lot of Brook Lopez. That franchise has suffered, my god.   https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/NJN/leaders_career.html"
"Seeing as Brook Lopez is the all-time Nets leading scorer, then yes absolutely."
"Regarding the 3 second violation: It’s not simply if a guy is in the paint for 3 seconds, he broke the rule.  There’s lots of exceptions.  Like if you are the primary defender on the guy with the ball, no def 3 sec.  if you tag a guy crossing the paint (ie touch him), your 3 seconds resets.  That’s why some guys can be in the paint for 10 seconds and not get called.  There’s a great article on the Athletic about it in regards to Brook Lopez  https://theathletic.com/1976623/2020/08/14/cleansing-clearing-and-2-9-ing-how-the-bucks-brook-lopez-protects-the-paint/"
"Team of simmons, tucker, house, eric gordon and brook lopez is top 5 lotto team in both conferences"
"James ""I am the MVP"" Harden in the ECSF: 10.8 points 3turnovers on 31/19/89 shooting. Is he even better than Brook Lopez?"
I feel like Brook Lopez earns a spot. Kinda went quite in those last few games of the finals but he’s an underrated interior defender and all around solid stretch C. One of those guys you could plug in any team.
"Brook Lopez almost had a chance of getting his jersey retired by the Nets, even though they barely won shit."
Yabu turning into Brook Lopez okay
"2019 FIBA World Cup team was pretty weak:  Derrick White, Donovan Mitchell, Joe Harris, Marcus Smart, Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Mason Plumlee, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Kemba Walker"
Damn you’re right. I guess other than Bam the best is probably Randle if you think he’s a 5 or Ayton if he’s not. After that it gets real bad. Brook Lopez is in the discussion. Didn’t realize that pretty much every great big is international.
**2015-2016 NBA Season**  |Rk|Player|Pos|FG%| |-:|:-|:-|-:| |1|DeAndre Jordan|C|.703| |2|Dwight Howard|C|.620| |3|Hassan Whiteside|C|.606| |4|Enes Kanter|C|.576| |5|Marcin Gortat|C|.567| |6|Jonas Valanciunas|C|.565| |7|Kenneth Faried|PF|.558| |8|Karl-Anthony Towns|C|.542| |9|Robin Lopez|C|.539| |10|Gorgui Dieng|C|.532| |11|Greg Monroe|C|.522| |12|Andre Drummond|C|.521| |13|Nerlens Noel|C|.521| |14|LeBron James|SF|.520| |15|Derrick Favors|PF|.515| |16|Thaddeus Young|PF|.514| |17|LaMarcus Aldridge|PF|.513| |18|Nikola Jokic|C|.512| |19|Brook Lopez|C|.511| |20|Nikola Vucevic|C|.510| |21|Jahlil Okafor|C|.508| |22|Kawhi Leonard|SF|.506| |23|Giannis Antetokounmpo|PG|.506| |24|Kevin Durant|SF|.505| |25|Al Horford|C|.505| |26|Stephen Curry|PG|.504|  So by your measure Steph was the 26th best shooter in the league during his 2015-2016 season?
&gt;How in god's green earth you are 7 ft tall and you average 6 rebounds per game? That's laughably bad.  Brook Lopez?
"Dwight has been flexing his stretch 3 skills in garbage time, I could see Vogel working it in during the early regular season to test it out lol Brook Lopez grew his game why can't Dwight?"
"That's why I'm willing to forgive most of his flaws due to having 3 head coaches in 4 years, 2 of which were not NBA level, but the lackluster effort as a 7 footer is just so hard to justify.  I had the *exact* same complaints about Brook Lopez back when he played for the Nets and Luol Deng was outrebounding him.   It's just inexcusable for a 7 footer in the NBA."
"Saw the Lopez brothers at Disneyland in 2010. Asked for a selfie and Brook said 'Dude fuck off we just want some chowder.' Found out later it's actually against Disneyland policy for celebrities to do pictures or autographs, wish he would have said that instead."
"KD wouldn’t have gotten the shot off if Brook Lopez didn’t commit a shot clock turnover. There are a lot of ifs these clown on here abt to talk about to try and discredit Giannis but what did happen was Giannis dragged his nuts across everyone’s foreheads and averaged 30/13/5 on 60% ts to win a championship, while also leading in every defensive stat. They can keep crying about KDs toes, next time dude should work on his foot work"
"I actually think there were alot of similarities between the two. Milwaukee went all in on paying a ton of average players in that dreadful summer of 2016 that everybody screwed up. Dellavedova, Snell, Plumlee(Miles the shitty one), Mirza Teletovic(shit forgot he even existed) just tons of awful money. If Giannis had ended up walking you couldve traced alot of their issues back to that summer and he wouldve had valid complaints.   The difference really just came in 2018-19 when Budenholzer came and Brook Lopez as well(the Bledsoe trade also helped alot in the reg season). Sum greater than its parts I dont even know if internally the Bucks expected to win 61 games that yr. But when you win 60+ games it kind of changes it all and if Portland did that I dont think Dame would be in this spot right now.   They won a ring but Giannis had already committed I dont think them getting spanked by a healthy Nets team vs winning a title mattered in that sense to Giannis's trajectory. He just wanted to be there and they had had more success than Portland in his early yrs. The Jrue trade helped although there's always luck involved. I do think if Giannis left though this wouldve been a much better ex to use of the ""well there's only so much small markets can do"" type narrative than what is happening with Dame/Portland."
"Smh you hear Brooklyn and think brook lopez, I think Joe Johnson, Paul pierce, Kevin Garnett LOL the OG Brooklyn nets"
"The 2017 warriors   Curry (2x Mvp) Klay  (all star HOF) Iguadala (all star, finals MVP) Durant (MVP, 2xFMVP)  Dray (all star, defensive player of the year)  David West (all star) Livingston Pre Leg Injury was a STUD Nick Young  Javale  Chris Boucher  Patrick mccaw 3 time champ (lmao)   But I think #1 sleeper is 2013-2014 nets   Deron Williams (all star) Joe Johnson (all star) Pierce (all star, fmvp) KG (mvp, DPOY) Brook Lopez (all star)  Jason Terry (6 man of year, clutch underrated) Andre Kirilenko (all star, all nba defense) Livingston   That team would be insane in their prime"
"I'm sorry but I really disagree with this. Pat is a key piece of the rotation, a plus defender, rebounder, and can hit shots. It's not a coincidence the Bucks best +/- lineups include Pat. Brook has issues against certain matchups for sure but Giannis and Portis filling in those minutes works well. When Lopez is on he's a monster on defense. Right now assuming no big injuries they certainly don't _need_ Nwora or Hood. Always nice to know they can be good depth and step up if needed but this team has just proved they can win while only going 7 deep in the rotation"
2 shooters won’t get it done in the modern NBA. You need 3 or 4 players to cover the 3 pt line and be available for kick outs when a player drives the lane. Everybody wants more shooting. That’s why Brook Lopez shoots the 3 - a true 5 that can shoot the 3 makes the whole offense better.
"That’s what makes the whole thing so weird to me though. Maybe I’m just a homer but if we’re talking pure offensive skill I feel like Simmons is significantly better than Draymond on-ball. Facilitating I think is pretty equal, Dray might have that one but I really I think it’s close. My point in saying all of this is that I feel like it’d be ridiculous to suggest that the Warriors should have Draymond be a bench player.   As for your hypothetical about the future all I’ll say is it’s really difficult to predict how players develop and the timetables for it. Brook Lopez had a total of 3 three-pointers made prior to him turning 28. Weird shit happens."
"You wanna find out what would happen if Luka had Jrue holiday, Khris Middleton and brook Lopez on his team?"
"Brook Lopez too, sometimes."
"He’s really a terrible offensive player. Would rather have KT, AD or Brook Lopez"
"Well other than Bam, USA's options at center are... Brook Lopez? JaVale McGee? Dwight Howard? It's rough. At least Bam is pretty athletic and can defend the P&amp;R decently."
"Oh, please don't think I'm trying to suggest Ayton turned out to be bad or w/e because that's definitely not my view. I do think he played below his ability that series, and that not all of it was due to the match-up, but yes the majority of it was due to the match-up. There isn't really an individual Giannis stopper, and Lopez' to score is criminally underrated. Brook is also a generous 'one of' the league's best rim protectors, and Giannis is, as always, Giannis. This Bucks team is not easy for big men without a 3-point shot. Ayton isn't an exception to that, even if he's a very good C."
"I mean he still lost. You could also say that Brook Lopez didn’t have an unforced blunder the prior possession the Bucks likely lock up the win even earlier.   This isn’t about how good KD is, I’m just saying that to reach the CF and Finals you need great talent."
Trade for Brook Lopez
We are a brook lopez away from two pairs of brothers on the team
"James Harden, Klay Thompson, DeMar DeRozan, Spencer Dinwiddie, Paul George, Kyle Korver, Russell Westbrook, Kawhi Leonard, Brook Lopez, Jrue Holiday, another dozen current NBA guys to choose from... yeah they'd be alright. 10m people though, not 4m like that dude said."
"yes, it happens. even with just the bucks this happened when brook lopez signed his first contract, he was just two years removed from one of his best scoring years."
All this to stop Brook Lopez
"&gt;The Lopez twins’ love of all things Disney has been well-documented over the years, with Brook even owning a house on the property at Disney’s Orlando theme park.  You think they play kingdom hearts?"
He limits the type of defenses you can play. Think brook Lopez drop coverage without the elite rim protection.
"Idc what type of offensive production he had in the Turkish league when it was coming from back to the basket scoring. He’s not going to be able to score that way against guys like Embiid, AD, or Brook Lopez. I mean he still hasn’t proven he can space the floor or guard the P&amp;R.  If we get 2 lottery picks with the Wizards unprotected landing in the top 10 that’s a win in my books."
"It's not even about him guarding the opposing team's best player because the Bucks switch so often.  He was one of 4 defenders in their closing lineup. The Suns always attacked that 5th defender (Lopez or Bobby).  Now the Bucks can only trot our Giannis, Khris, Jrue and 2 other mediocre perimeter defenders (yes, Brook). It's a huge blow because you can scheme away defensively from Jrue, Khris and Giannis.  This is honestly a bigger blow for the Bucks than people think."
Fuck it call in Brook Lopez or Dwight
Still pissed that brook Lopez wasn’t picked for the team but bam was.
"Jarret Allen, Christian Wood, Brook Lopez etc."
The best American big is Brook Lopez.
Bam has been playing like a fraud since Brook Lopez worked him in the playoffs.
"not just that, but the fact that brook lopez was let go for peanuts"
"He has a very long way to go to be a stretch 5 if his mid-range percentages are in the 30s, and thats on low volume  I'd be amazed if he even becomes 50% of present-day Brook Lopez from 3pt range"
"I mean its less about the actual percentage and more about him being respected enough to open up the paint for everyone else when hes on the perimeter. Brook lopez was mediocre from 3 last year and shot 34% this year, which is ok but below league average, but hes enough to be seen as a threat"
You were a Brook Lopez brain death from not even getting that shot.
He's 26. We're going to re-sign him to replace Brook Lopez who is not 26.
"And Brook Lopez, just to have the other side of the spectrum."
luc reminds me so much of brook lopez its crazy.  and pippen and luc and kerr.  all guys who were very selfless.  luke the bucks rn.
"I did make that up, but id imagine 3 has to be close to the record   Trying to think of some brother combos that theoretically could have overlapped in the past:   Giannis/Thanasis   Robin/Brook Lopez  Marcus/Markieff Morris  Plumlees  Zellers"
"I'm somewhere in the middle of the trade cj debate, i think he offers a lot of value as a scorer who can take over playoff games, but he is a horrendously bad defensive fit next to dame, and he can be a ball stopper at times. with the addition of powell, cj's spot on this team is really unclear. we also have ant simons off the bench, who is better from 3 and gives more effort defensively. personally, i think a new coach will hopefully transform both our offense (pnr/iso heavy to more ball movement/cutting) and our defense (non-existant to something) and both changes could help cj, but they might not. he was having his best year before he got injured last season, maybe he can replicate the magic. generally not a ton of trade options either, though our sub has floated guys like Hayward or Jerami Grant  Who tf wants trade brook lopez lmao"
Is it wild if I think I'm a CJ believer? No horse in the race but having a high volume good 3-point shooter next to Dame who is almost always gonna get doubled feels like a good fit.  We've got the regular battles between Bud Good and Bud Bad. And the **dummies** who think we need to trade Brook Lopez.
"Looking at the shooting splits  against a player in a single series isn’t the most fair or effective way to evaluate a players defense.  1.	It’s a small sample size.  2.	It gives you no concept of how the player was giving up the shots (I.e say the man you was guarding Booker lost him on a screen and PJ was running over to help late and Booker makes the 3; PJ was the closest defender but he didn’t do anything wrong)  3.	as other have said, it doesn’t count all of the hustle plays and little things that he does on the defensive end.   I honestly do not know any defensive stat to look at for a single series that can definitively show me the value of someone’s defense. The only real way to evaluate it is by the eye test. From what I remember (this is subjective), PJ was fairly disruptive on the defensive end especially late in games of the finals. And I don’t remember him ever getting hunted.   The thing that PJ provides the bucks that is very valuable is his ability to switch. Brook Lopez was getting cooked in the finals. Being able to run switching lineups with Giannis at center is what made the bucks a championship team. PJ allowed them to do that."
"Ooh wait, we should talk about this, clippers would love brook Lopez"
"Pau was a 10+ RPG guy for a while but Marc was more of a boxout and let his teammates grab it guy. His individual rebound numbers don't do justice to his impact on team rebounding, similar to New Jersey Brook Lopez"
They don't call defensive 3 seconds in the playoffs either and in the last minutes in the regular season too. That's an open secret. Teams  design plays banking on centers violating the 3 sec rule. There is a reason the midrange shot is more popular in the playoffs. If you watch your serie Vs the bucks you were camping the paint. Similarly brook Lopez didn't do shit vs the heat except be 7ft and camp the paint. And that stopped bam.
"If you look at the top posts on the Nets subreddit over the past month, most of our frustration is directed at Kevin Durant's feet being too long.   A lot of Nets fans were rooting against the Bucks, but I think that's to be expected. Fanbases tend to root against the team that eliminated them. Even then, one of the top posts on our sub is congratulating Brook Lopez for becoming a champion."
"Warriors fans told me how Giannis and Curry are friends. Now I gotta throw the shitty trade takes out too, you think Brook Lopez and Pat Connaughton is a good deal?"
I would rather have current Brook Lopez than Ben

yes; ala brook lopez / ayton
Brook Lopez
Brook Lopez
Unironically wish the US had Brook or Robin Lopez
Unironically wish we had Brook Lopez. Or even Robin.
The Lakers need a center. I wonder if they ever wondered what Brook Lopez or Zubac would look like in the purple and gold?
brook lopez was already a beast before his Laker time though
Half of Steph Curry   JJ Reddick   Gordon Hayward   Domontas Sabonis (he was born in Portland)   Brook Lopez
"A lot of ex-Lakers have flourished the past few years beyond their Laker days.  Julius Randle Jordan Clarkson D'Angelo Russell Brandon Ingram Brook Lopez Ivica Zubac Lou Williams  This is just from memory, could be more."
"I think if coaches had more than one challenge, granted they get the challenges correct, we’d see a big time difference in foul calls and obvious flops  Talking to you, Brook Lopez... /s"
"Brook Lopez should not be guarding any starter level guard on the perimeter tbh, much less guys like Kyrie/Harden lmao"
"There’s a difference. Westbrook is ball dominant. Bogi averages 2.7 more shots per game than Donte does. That isn’t significant at all, if Giannis and Middletons ppg drop by 1 each, who gives a shit? Shooters are plug in players, and Bogi also wouldn’t need to be a great defender since that lineup has DPOY Giannis, elite defender Jrue, above average Middleton and above average rim protector Brook Lopez. Plus, it’s not like Bogi is an actively bad defender. He’s been very serviceable on D, even with the highest offensive workload of his career lately."
"He really wouldnt at all. You guys live in the moment, Bogdan wasnt even a useful piece when hunter and reddish were healthy what makes you think he'd be a properly utilized piece as a 4rth/5th option behind 3 all star calibur players and brook lopez?"
Brook Lopez guarding harden and kyrie?  If the bucks give up that switch then they should just forfeit
Jrue will most likely be matched up with Harden. Regardless I'm guessing Brook Lopez/PJ Tucker/Bobby Portis and Dizicenzo will be the ones forced to guard Kyrie/Harden as they will hunt those matchups
Brook Lopez is useless on D unless he's standing 5 feet inside the paint. that drop D led to so many open threes in the fourth quarter when the Hawks just kept spamming the high P&amp;Rs
It's so weird how between the choices of Brook Lopez or Andrew Bynum the Magic chose Nikola Vucevic and it worked out for them. Lol.
"Brook Lopez in the past decade, Shawn Kemp growing up."
"Brook Lopez is incredible in how he changed his game completely during his career. He was known as a good offensive/bad defensive center in Brooklin, then added a 3 pt shot, and then became good on defense. It is kind of remarkable."
(scared of brook lopez)
"You could make your point without underselling Brook Lopez as a stretch 5. He's at .355 from three this year, not .310  That's the difference between Russell Westbrook and Trae Young."
"He does everything you want a non-go-to big man to do. Excellent screen setter, great rim runner, tough on the boards.  I swear this sub acts like it's better to be Brook Lopez standing behind the arc and shooting 31% and grabbing no rebounds than it is to be playing your role perfectly like Gobert."
"He would be similar to Brook Lopez on offense if he develops a 3 point shot (which he easily could've). He wasn't a dominant rebounder/playmaker or defender to make him one of the ""best players in the league"". I just don't see him being a 20 player in the league.   Contrary to this, in the 90's and 80's he might've been a top 10 player for sure."
"He’d still be a monster. He had a really nice mid range game, I can easily see him being an effective stretch player which makes him even scarier.   He’d be a perennial all star version of Brook Lopez. Like a brook Lopez on steroids but with a filthier post game.... dude would wreck havoc."
A big lumbering guy wouldn't be of much use except in brook Lopez type of roles. He would get absolutely torched in p&amp;r's.
"Their record 2 years ago has nothing to do with this season lmao. His coach is unquestionably worse, his team has much less depth both because of trades and players like Brook Lopez regressing in a big way, they have also dealt with injuries like early in the season when Jrue was missing games which was when they were struggling the most. Yes, they addressed a need by getting Jrue, whos missed even more games than Joel has, and is having his worst season in years.   The literal only knocks on Philly were Brett brown and the fact that they didn't have shooters. They went out and got all the shooters they could and replaced Brett brown with an all time coach.   And yeah, I'm in the minority opinion, because the mvp is a purely media driven award. People are tired of the Giannis narrative, so they moved on to someone else."
Magic Johnson really let Brook Lopez walk for nothing...
"Embiid is having a great game, but Brook Lopez, the clearly superior player, is outperforming him. Just as you might expect from these games."
"No Ben, on a back to back and some rust for Tobi to shake off. Will be a tough game.  In my dream world Embiid will hit a turn around jumper on Brook Lopez to put us up 16 with 2 minutes left and the entire squad just sits down on the Bucks logo"
"When we talk about defence, most people pretend like defence can be summed up in one number or score.   *eg. A level 87 defender is better than a level 74 defender.*   When you're talking about defending Embiid, you have to understand what kind of player he is.    He is very big, very crafty and very talented and it's in that order:  1. Big 2. Crafty 3. Talented   He likes to bully and overpower you more than he likes to out-skill you. If he can't bully you, he tries to get the foul on you. If he can't get the foul he goes to his back of tricks to score on you (step backs, dream shakes, skyhooks, etc. he can do it all).  So when you want to defend him, the first thing you need is a guy who is big enough to match Embiid and hold their ground. You have to take away Embiid's 1st scoring option otherwise he'll eat you alive.  This is why a bad defender like Enes Kanter is better at defending Embiid than a good defender like Myles Turner. Turner doesn't have the size to stop Embiid's first scoring option. Kanter can at least hold his ground physically.  Now look at Brook Lopez.   1. He's big enough to hold his ground.   2. He's experienced enough to defend without fouling.   So against Lopez, Embiid can't use his 1st or 2nd option. He has to use his 3rd option, which harder and less reliable to pull off.   He's still a threat, but he's less of a threat.   After that, one of the only offensive weaknesses Embiid has is that he panics a little bit when you blitz him. Help defence can be pretty effective against him.  The Bucks have Giannis, as others have said, he's is one of the best help defenders in the NBA. The Bucks also love to clog the paint.   So they're in a good position to attack Embiid and stop him from going to work."
Brook Lopez is a liability against smaller guards. He does fine against Embiid. Embiid will still get his numbers but Lopez does a decent job
Brook Lopez is slow but still protects the rim pretty well
"Oh yeah I get what you're saying and there's no comparison to Capela, I'm just trying to find a better comparison in Brook Lopez. And everyone last year was calling Brook a winner, and he was one of the most important players on those dominant Bucks squads as a defender and floor stretcher. I believe whatever applies to Brook can also apply to Turner, they're not that far off in terms of shooting, and if Brook has value stretching the floor for the Bucks, I believe Turner has almost as much value in that regard. But if we are saying Brook is not a floor stretcher then I'm fine saying Turner isn't either."
"True, but the theory of Turner is solid. He's basically a better version of Brook Lopez who stretches the floor for the Bucks, but he doesn't have the gravity of a Giannis/Middleton/Jrue to create open looks for him. Swap BroLo for Turner and I guarantee people would have a better opinion of him and he'd be just as much of a winner as Brook."
"Bruh when this started the Nets were starting Jarrett Jack, Joe Johnson, Wayne Ellington, Thaddeus Young and Brook Lopez    They played the Spurs, who started Tony Parker, Danny Green, Kawhi Leonard, Tim Duncan and LaMarcus Aldridge"
Brook Lopez was super underrated (under the radar is more accurate) for pretty much all of his time with the Nets. Not a great rebounder for his size but the dude got buckets
Brook Lopez is the Nets' all-time leading scorer.
"I was going to say AD too but I guess he counts as a PF for the sake of this, but if you count him as a centre then he's on the list too.  After that it's... Brook Lopez? Myles Turner? Uhhh Andre Drummond?  And then we're starting to get reaaaaally thin from here lol"
Rebounding is still mostly effort and size/length/athleticism. Raw numbers fool you too its a team concept. For example people thought Brook Lopez was a terrible rebounder early in his career but he was actually great at boxing out the other teams best rebounder.
The point of the stat is to show that it’s not a guy who never shot 3s then started shooting them one year and shot well (like Brook Lopez). It’s more impressive for someone to shoot that many 3s that poorly and then improve this much in one season.
"I think you could argue a guy like Brook Lopez here too. They said Randle would be the first to go from sub-30% to over 40%, but Lopez increased from 0% to 36% which is more signficant.  Granted, he wasn't taking them before. But that's arguably a little more impressive considering he completely changed his shot pattern successfully. Marc Gasol too.  I wonder how much the absence of fans impacted this too, quite a few guys seem to be better shooters this year but that's just a guess on my part. I never would have seen Randle improving his shooting this much, which is great for the Knicks."
"yeah, TJ’s a good one. without looking at specificstats, tobias harris and brook lopez also come to mind."
"I know you added the stat ""below 30% on &gt; 500 3PA"" but reading the subjective title ""mid-career increase in long-distance shooting *proficiency*"" fits Brook Lopez just as much if not more. From barely shooting any to 34-36% on good volume. He went from literally not proficient at all to 3-pt threat.  Nevertheless, Randle is insane and he has my MIP vote."
"I get those stats they are using say that, but lets be real, Brook Lopez definitely takes this title.  Randle is looking incredible though."
Saying that Brook Lopez and Jrue Holiday are all-stars is like saying the Lakers had all-stars Rajon Rondo and Dwight Howard last year.  By this logic DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin are all-stars for the Nets and they have 5 all-stars.
"LeBron deserves the same shit KD gets for the Beatles and the Lakers nonsense, KD did the same shit with the Warriors as Brook Lopez is doing with the Nets and deserves even more shit because he sandbagged multiple years with the pistons"
"Same for us. Brook Lopez will be virtually unplayable that series, unfortunately it’ll probably take bud 3-4 games to realize it."
"I've looked into this too.  At one point this season, Brook Lopez was 32-14.  Enes Kanter was 7-25.  That's as far as I got lol."
They needed Brook Lopez and it seems he’s on the block
Brook and Robin Lopez. There’s no other answer
"Lol, reading the title I thought he was gonna do what Brook Lopez did to a chair in the bubble just beyond camera view (but you could still see a little bit and hear what was going on in the tunnel area). I guess for Poku taking out his frustrations on a chair is lightly tapping on it."
LOL i feel the same way about Brook Lopez
Does Brook Lopez really even exist?
PG: Kidd  SG: Harden  SF: Dr. J  PF:  Durant  Center: Brook Lopez   I’m taking the Nets.
"I feel like this stat is wrong, I don’t think that’s the second highest.  Edit: Brook Lopez, 14.3% to 34.6%.  I’m sure there are others, but just this once debunks it so no need to do the work."
Not currently but I'd give the world to see Brook Lopez back in Brooklyn. That man got us through some tough times.
Brook Lopez plays for the Bucks.
"It'd be like the Bucks playing Giannis and Brook Lopez together, but on steroids"
"I wasted my time googling ""Brook Lopez shooting highlights"" and looking at the first result?"
Yup same thick legs as Yao and Brook Lopez.
"If you look at the NBA stats by play type and filter by points per possession, then only look at those for whom post ups represent 20% or more of their shots, you get a pretty good list.  Some surprises:  - Robin Lopez is more effective in the post than Brook. Also more effective than KAT, Jokic and Vuc. He’s flat out one of the best post scorer this season.  - LMA with the Nets (small sample) had been the second best post scorer this season, behind only Embiid.  - Melo is taking near a quarter of his shots in the post this year.  - Other lesser thought of names high on this list include JV, Ayton, Okafor and Trez"
"As a nets fan and Brook Lopez supporter, I wish he would mix that into his game and use it more. I know playing with Giannis means stretching the floor is more important but I think he wouldve been able to put up really good numbers over the last couple of years if he was featured more instead of being relegated to a spot up 3 point shooter."
"When Brook Lopez posts up (Which Bud frustratingly never utilizes), he’s still really good. He has a really diverse set of moves that remind me of another era.  I’m not sure who else you’d want to include as being “obvious,” (probably Jokic) but others that come to mind include Vucevic and Sabonis."
"Maybe not the best, but Brook Lopez used to make a living on the post. That’s why he’s the Nets All time leading scorer"
Yeah because Brook Lopez would be a real game-changer against them
"&gt;I agree with the Scott take overall, but let’s not pretend that he didn’t have the best roster the Nets had ever seen.  Which is damning with extremely faint praise.  Those were almost certainly the worst teams ever to make consecutive Finals trips.  &gt;  Jason Kidd was more responsible for taking those teams to the finals than Scott.   Which is why Kidd went to the Finals all the time... wait a minute, no he didn't.  Kidd made exactly one other trip to the Conference Finals, and only that because Dirk Nowitzki dragged him and his 40% shooting kicking and screaming there.  You are absolutely talking out of your asshole there.  Jason Kidd played almost 20 years and made the Conference Finals only 3 times.  &gt; Some guys who came after Scott (such as Avery Johnson, P.J. Carlesimo, Lionel Hollins or Kenny Atkinson), and definitely some guys who preceded him (such as Larry Brown, Chuck Daly or John Calipari) would have had a lot of success with those early-00’s Nets teams as well, imo.   No other Net coach has yet made the conference finals in the NBA.  In fact, all other Nets coached combined have so far won 5 NBA playoff series.  Scott won 6.  Daly had Derrick Coleman, Drazen Petrovic, and Kenny Anderson and went nowhere.   Brown, Hollins, Carlesimo, and Calipari didn't even last two seasons in New Jersey, never mind winning anything.  Avery Johnson posted a slick 34% winning percentage with Deron Williams, Brook Lopez, and Devin Harris -- All-stars all at some point.  Atkinson won 1 playoff game with Irving, Russell, Harris, Allen, Levert, Dinwiddie, and others.  So no, it's highly unlikely any of those guys make even one Final trip -- exactly because they collectively barely won a playoff game, and most got canned in their second season."
"Brook Lopez was 6 and showing GOAT potential. Magic knew that nothing could stop Brook from passing him all time, so he decided he might as well give up."
He's a tweener between a 4 and 5 that's the issue with him. They'd be much better if they could play him at the 4 and find a Brook Lopez type player.
"Lillard, Smart, J. Harris, KD, Brook Lopez. So many 3s  I also don’t want 5 guys who need the ball. Lopez and Harris play off it, Smart takes pressure off Lillard on both ends, and KD is KD."
No way in hell Brook Lopez is better than Valanciunas
"Serge, Poetl, and Brook Lopez over Sabonis? The fuck?"
"Bucks fans, does brook lopez typically pull up from four steps out of the 3 point line? Is that his range? Or were those 3s out of the ordinary?"
Call me a crazy homer but I'd rather have Timelord than Brook Lopez or Jakob Poetl (though I'd take Vuc over Timelord)
1. Nikola Jokic 2. Joel Embiid 3. Rudy Gobert 4. Karl Anthony Towns 5. Bam Adebayo 6. Kristaps Porzingis 7. Domantas Sabonis 8. Nikola Vucevic 9. Clint Capela 10. Jusuf Nurkic 11. Myles Turner 12. Christian Wood 13. Jonas Valanciunas 14. Brook Lopez 15. DeAndre Ayton
Myles Turner and Brook lopez are way too high. Also putting 2 all stars at 15/16 lmao

This is what I think of when I hear Brook Lopez talk.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b5IpCpeb0M&amp;ab\_channel=sanjeev1980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b5IpCpeb0M&amp;ab_channel=sanjeev1980)
Brook-lyn Lopez
Robin Lopez an Brook Lopez were born on the same day!
"Brook Lopez stepped on his toe so hard it broke the nail off and gave him a contusion. He sat out a few games with that, and has been playing through it, but I'm guessing it's bothering him again."
Brook Lopez is colossal titan confirmed
Did Marv just confuse Brook Lopez and Trae Young??
"He does the same thing against every team, especially if opponent bigs stay under the basket like Lopez. He shoots over 7 footers no problem. He's just been injured and hasn't played so probably not at his best. It's not like Brook is stepping forward and offering a close contest of his floater."
Literally the only shot Trae Young has selected is a floater over Brook Lopez. I don't understand why it's all he wants to do 😭
Brook Lopez walks like he shit his pants
Brook Lopez is the best player in the league  at making Trae Young floaters not go in
the long lost son of brook lopez
"I remember when The Starters we're still The Basketball Jones, they went to all star and were asking players what they thought they could beat Michael Jordan at. Most of them had some hobby or whatever, Brook Lopez said Marvel vs. Capcom. My man LA said a mid-range shot, no hesitation."
"Harrisson Barnes , Marcus Smart , Joe Harris Brook Lopez and Kemba Walker are gonna end up being the starting 5."
Ya.. the smarter ones ones using Brook Lopez as a flair still aren’t fooling anyone. It’s very easy to tell the age just by the way they type
Brook Lopez with the casual infinity points per tweet
Brook Lopez is clearly the goat
"Same, dude. Being a Nets fan is so weird. In 2013-2015 we had Brook Lopez and the ghost of Kevin Garnett."
"Thats ""Nets all time leading scorer brook lopez"" too you"
"The nets built a playoff team with brook Lopez a bunch of low firsts and UDFAs. Well run franchises can manage just fine. Also the nets are in a big market and and attract even moderate talent easily just playing with a different set of rules than small market teams who need these long rebuilds.   It’s def possible Giannis is gone in 2027 when that last unprotected pick conveys its 6 years away.  And then there’s just the general idea that outside of the top 5 and once you get into the bottom of the top 10 the average outcome of the picks are low end starters/backups. The odds are pretty good the rockets never get a top 5 pick out of this that’s just reality of playing in a big market the current lottery reform and how people always overstate the chances of a bad team being super bad in a particular season.   This entire trade was just for Tillman to sell false hope, pinch pennies and just kick the can down the road 5 years. They held out for weeks demanding a young all star and a haul of picks(not an unreasonable ask) them only getting picks is a disastrous return."
A brook lopez would be perfect for that team.
"Team rebounding. If you looks at his stats, brook lopez looks like a bad rebounder for his height/size. But he is one of the best I’ve ever seen when it comes to boxing out opposing Big men. Despite his pedestrian numbers his teams are always towards the top of the league in terms of rebounding"
"The Celtics had to get super lucky with injuries to the Nets to get both Jaylen and Tatum. First the ""super team"" with KG and Pierce failed because our best player Brook Lopez broke his foot. D-Will continually got injured so we had to eat his contract and let him go fucking up our cap. And then our starting PGs got injured pretty much immediately two seasons in a row, J-Lin coming off a really strong season on the Hornets, and then DLo. Because it happened once with the Celtics doesn't mean it's likely to occur again... Although who knows the Nets are kinda cursed.  Also you have to count on the Net's scouting and g-league team which has been super solid to be complete ass, Sean Marks to be a dummy, and for the Nets to no longer be located in NYC, oh and for Tsai to no longer want to spend any extra money.  Those picks and pick swaps may end up juicy, but wagering on a team with ZERO incentive to be bad, is a tad risky to me, especially since that team is located in NY, has a rich ass owner, and a pretty solid FO."
Brook fucken Lopez turns into Steph Curry from 3 whenever he plays the Pistons and I fucken hate him.
LOL and your reasoning for saying he can is...  Imagine thinking a guy who gets gameplanned against is good enough to lead a team to a chip. He puts up huge numbers against shitty 8th seed teams then somehow gets neutralized against the actual teams.   Man got outplayed by Middleton and geriatric brook lopez LMAO
"No center is equal value to Kyrie. All are above or below, there’s no center that reflects his value.  Best you’ll get is like a Brook Lopez tier center and other assets"
"Those last two are not like the first two.  I would also say the Derron Williams, Joe Johnson, Jason Terry, Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Brook Lopez nets were up there but the stars on that team flamed out so fast"
I currently love to watch Brook Lopez
"2013-14 Nets are always up there.      A starting line up of D-Will, Joe Johnson, Paul Pierce, KG and Brook Lopez. Really good complimentary pieces too Jason Terry, AK47, Teletovic, Livingston and Plumlee."
"Kanter, is actually not a super bad defender if he's put in a traditional center role. Sort of like Brook Lopez. Of course Brook is a much better defender, but he wouldn't be getting DPOY votes if Bucks lacked guards who can fight over screens."
"The standard for being a viable big man in the 3pt era has risen dramatically. In the past you could pass for an NBA level center simply by having a postgame and being 7ft tall. Center was the deepest and strongest position for most teams.  Now your center needs to reach a minimum skill level.   1) On defense he needs to be able to switch onto the perimeter, while also be able to be a deterrent at the rim.  2) on offense he must be able to  a. shoot (AD, Jokic, KP, Embiid, brook lopez, gasol) or b. handle (AD, bam, jokic, draymond) or c. pass (jokic, bam, draymond, gasol)   If your center can do 1 &amp; 2, he is neither a liability on offense or defense. If he is lacking in just one side of the ball he gets played off the floor. This is why a good center is so hard to come by. Having a good center can separate you from the pack, unlike guards which every team has"
"This will be fun bc when the heatles were formed people complained It wasn’t fair. Same with the Durant warriors that the title is already settled.  Now we got three elite of the elite and everyone thinks will implode, will be exciting.  That said people are still sleeping in Milwaukee  Kyrie- jrue Harden -middleton  Kd-giannis Deandre-brook Lopez.  Nets win on offense Bucks on defense.  Interesting to see now that harden won’t have to have a crazy useage and more talent who can dominate he seemed More engaged and had more energy for defensive"
Brook lopez.
"The yeae before, Melo was the firsr guy in NY.  Rondo, Pippen, Worthy, McHale... Are not first type guys. But their are peefect to build a super team.  Randle is the number one guy in NY averaging crazy numbers. He's not a super team piece material.  Klay Thompson is the god complement player. Can't be number one because his style of play.  Everyone has their own definition about what's a super team.  But, in my opinion, if you have an all time great that the year before, and since his second year was THE GUY on his teams in Melo, an MVP who averaged a triple double during 3 seasons, a 3rd in MVP voting, all nba defense guy who can knock 3s like crazy + an interior enforcer... For me that's a super team. We don't see them as a superteam because it didn't work.  Same as Those Prokhorov Nets. But I remember the league being scared as shit, even saying the Russian was paying under handz because a team that had...   old but still  decent KG and Pierce. They had the same age as LeBron now  All star Joe Johnson  Andrei fucking Kirilenko (not im his prime, but still)   Deron Williams (who averaged the 3 seasons before 20/9)  20 ppg and all star the year before Brook Lopez  Jason Terry, who was the hero of the finals 2 seasons before  Shaun Livingston, who after that tenure was a fundamental piece in the GSW 3 rings  An enforcer like Evans, who had +11 boards per game the year before  And then good players.  Andray Blatche had 16ppg 2 years before  Teletovic was a solid player  Thorton averaged 12ppg and 38% from 3  Rookie Plumlee..."
I cringe every time we play the Magic because I know Vucevic is going to have a damn near 30+ point triple double by beating the fuck out of Brook Lopez all game.
"Gotta be a 3 way and trade brook lopez,  donte, Portis plus what ever picks they somehow have left. Maybe Lopez to the kings for Helios and then trade Heild, donte, portis and picks for Collins. Not happening though"
"Good mental wont fix his shot. He just didn't focus on shooting and he doesn't have the reps that most NBA players got. Even if he works his ass off and has a clear mind it's going to be a while to see results if we ever would.   The only history I can think of of a non-shooter becoming a respect-worthy one is Brook Lopez and he was already a good FT shooter so he had the basic skills already.    It's unfair to expect Simmons to develop a shot just like it is for Dwight, or Capela, or Jakob Poeltl, or Drummond, or Gobert."
"Just because you have AD and LeBron and good players, that doesn't make you a super team.  Westbrook / Harden Rockets wasn't a super team  CP3 / Harden wasn't a super team  CP3 / peak Griffin / Peak DeAndre / Reddick/Crawford wasn't a super team   Kyrie / Tatum /Brown / Hayward wasn't a super team  Giannis / Middleton / Jrue isn't a super team  Shaq / Kobe Lakers wasn't a superteam  AD/LeBron Lakers aren't a super team  The 73 win Warriors wasn't a super team. It was a perfect assembled team    Superteams that succeeded   Russell Celtics  Magic Lakers  Bird Celtics   Jordan 2nd threepeat  Heatles  Celtics Rondo, KG, Pierce, Allen  KD,Steph, Draymond, Klay GSW     Superteams that don't succeeded  Moses, DR J, Barkley, Cheeks  Deron, Brook Lopez, Old KG and Pierce, Kirilenko, Joe Johnson  Lakers Kobe, Shaq, Payton and Malone  LakersDwight, Gasol, Nash, Kobe, Artest   Westbrook, Melo, Paul George, Adams    New and only super team currently   Kyrie, KD, Harden"
"My b, only moved to brooklyn a couple years ago so not completely sure who you mean. Brook lopez?"
"I know we play the bucks next but we could use brook lopez ............ big man , defends and can hit a 3 plus ft."
brook lopez and embiid are the main worries. also bam adebayo. giannis is somewhat of a big.
5 years ago i used to be excited to watch Jeremy Lin and Brook Lopez. This is wild lmao
I never said he was a superstar. He’s paid like a first option. He puts up empty stats and doesn’t show up when it matters. He was literally non existent both playoff series he was in. Guy got bullied by brook fuckin Lopez
His issue is defending the perimeter. Players like Brook Lopez kill him anytime they match up. He simply cannot defend the perimeter because if he defends to stop the pump fake and drive they defender just shoots the 3 and if he defends the 3 he usually bites and the player gets 3 free throws or an open lane to the basket.
"Nah look up his combine stats [definitely slow but moves well for being 7' 7"", and this is him before NBA training](https://streamable.com/idlt9)  His stats were slow but on par with players like brook lopez and Rudy gobert. I think his real work needs to come on the offensive end from freethrows to post moves."
Can we show how he got fouled on that last possession by Brook Lopez? Not saying it would’ve changed everything but that’s a significant missed call.
mavericks are making brook lopez look like tim duncan tonight
Brook Lopez
George Hill  Seth Curry  Duncan Robinson  Robert Covington  Brook Lopez
"Sad thing is you don’t have to look too far back for a reference on the last time a Nets team bet their entire future on it. Granted this Big 3 is significantly better individually than Deron Williams, Joe Johnson, Brook Lopez and aging All-Star vets Paul Pierce and KG. But still...Celtics entire core is basically thanks to that trade made with the Nets, I think it’s safe to say the Rockets next iteration will be built through the draft thanks to the Nets."
"Smart was guarding Giannis, Middleton, and Brook Lopez at times during the Bucks Celtics series in 2019. He's the most versatile defender in the entire league IMO"
How can you disrespect Brook Lopez like this?
Kyrie aside if both Durant and Harden sign a 2yr extension the trade is worth it.   They would finish their deals at the end of the 2024-25 season. The Rockets would have the 2026 1st and 2027 Swap when Harden is 35 and Durant is 36 and both possibly out of Brooklyn. Kyrie would be like 32.   Nets would open up a ton of Cap Space so they could sign Free Agents. The Celtics trade went bad because Lin and other FA’s got hurt so Marks stripped the team even more and got assets for Brook Lopez(D’Lo) and Bojan Bogdanovic(Allen). Thad Young was traded for LeVert before the season.   Just have to figure out if Kyrie will retire or get it together or can they somehow flip him for depth?   Pick Swaps don’t guarantee the Rockets will be better than the Nets years from now.
"It’s a good return for Harden and anyone saying it’s not is thinking way too immediately   We can have their 2024, 2025, 2026 and 2027 picks all unprotected.   Just look at the Harden, KD and Kyrie’s ages in 2027. 37, 38, 34. That’s old. And that’s even if all stay together which is pretty unlikely   Nets have no picks and no young players to make up for this. Last time they did this, at least they had Brook Lopez who kept them in a high lottery territory and was used to fulfill a younger squad when traded for Dlo   I like our chances very much in the future and I will be cheering Harden on to win a ring in the next 3 years. And then patiently waiting for the Nets to fall hard."
"We’re likely not changing much.  And honestly Lopez is a good center to play against the current Nets.  Jordan will have to get pulled out of the paint, and Jordan’s lost enough foot speed that Brook can camp out in the paint."

Shooting center brook lopez
"I mean, it worked out for the Celtics. Obviously PP/KG were way past their primes relative to Harden, but no one expected a Deron Williams/Joe Johnson/Pierce/KG/Brook Lopez team to bottom out as quickly as they did. In two years we could theoretically lose all three stars, and then who knows what happens."
"I remember going to a Nets-Pistons game during the Brook Lopez days (as a kid), safe to say that experience honestly makes want to not be a Nets fan, especially since this can do downhill in a snap or two (quite literally) and go back to how it was like in those dark days.  Hey, that's a rational non-bandwagoning fan tho. Not too easy to find those."
"The reason was not solely because of the trade tho. It was the collective of Iso Joe, KG, PeePee, Deron, Brook Lopez with Kidd coaching.   Lowkey they had a decent roster with Teletovic, Plum, Jet, Livingston, Anderson to support. Then Lopez got injured lmao, the whole team was barely healthy."
"Brook Lopez  Probably on the Nets for life if we didn’t trade him for DLo, great personality and our all time leading scorer"
"If Brook Lopez can turn into a trebuchet later in his career, I think we can assume Jordan would have learned to shoot 3s effectively."
"What’s the point of mentioning his college (and even last years) stats when his jumper has significantly improved? That’s like saying “dude Brook Lopez is a terrible shooter, check his college stats”"
i don't do this often with sports but I genuinely think some of my friends could make better rotations than bud. a player gets hot? sometimes he takes them out for like pat connaughton.. put thanasis in early in the quarter? sure... fourth q in the playoffs? 4 bench players and brook lopez
I was always a Larry Nance boy. I'll never forget when he brutally murdered future teammate Brook Lopez under the rim.
I honestly doubt you shoot as well as Simmons or rebound as well as Brook Lopez
Brook Lopez. His rim protection and ability to space the floor (even though his % has been pretty trash lately) are integral to Giannis’ role and playstyle on both sides of the floor.
For anyone wondering:  &amp;nbsp;  **Lineups:**    [](/CLE)Cavaliers (5-4) | [](/MIL)Bucks (5-4) --- | -- D. Dotson |  Jrue Holiday Isaac Okoro|  D. DiVincenzo Cedi Osman | K. Middleton Larry Nance |  Bobby Portis A. Drummond |  Brook Lopez  &amp;nbsp;  **Injured/Out:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers  | [](/MIL)Bucks (5-4) ---|---   C. Sexton (OUT) |   G. Antetokounmpo (OUT) D.

"Theyve been more creative trying stuff on defense this year, perhaps part of the reason why they have gotten off to a slower start on that end. They actually after game 1 vs Boston 2 years ago switched pick and rolls 1-4 and even had Brook Lopez switching onto Kyrie for a number of poss. But at the end of the day Budenholzer is Budenholzer, switching is too often thought of as a be all end all solution I would more just be looking for him showing more flexibility in how high he lets his bigs come in general out on defense. Which he's shown more of that so far this year, what will happen in the playoffs we'll see."
"Jokic, wood, Ibaka, KAT, Adams, ayton, gobert, capela, drummond, turner, bam, vucevic, embiid   Just going off who starts at center for each team, these people are all enter without question.  And then JV, Nurkic, Allen, Plumlee and Brook Lopez are arguable  So no."
"If Brook Lopez were in the place of Steven Adams we’d be 1-8 Rn, Adams is largely the reason we’re in close games.  The issue is that our guards aren’t providing shit atm. Ingram is the only guy on the team that can create his own offense."
Cause he had no spacing. If Brook Lopez were in the place of Steven Adams you’d really see some shit offensively.
"Carter is struggling defensively because donovan's schemes are awful, last year he anchored one of the better defenses in the game and now Billy is parking him directly under the basket so our league worst perimeter defense can personally escort the ball handler to the rim.  It's like putting Brook Lopez on point guards and then saying he's lost his touch"
"Genuine question why should it be much better? Jrue for Bledsoe is an upgrade but not huge, and the bench has lost some of its defense, Mathews, and Hill, and Brook Lopez is a years older."
The more threes Brook Lopez takes the uglier he gets
Brook and Robin Lopez gang
"Theis is fantastic at boxing out, and when you have big athletic wings who can go secure the board, that can make a bigger difference than grabbing 3-4 more boards a game yourself. Brook Lopez has never been a great rebounder himself, but his teams have always been towards the top of the league in rebounding because he is such a phenomenal team rebounder- theis does a lot of similar things"
"Brook Lopez is the perfect centre for a championship contender. Spaces the floor, protects the rim, all at a high level and is relatively cheap."
Definitely depends on the teams goals. If all I'm trying to do is make the playoffs set me up with the best rim protector available and I'll ride that into a first or second round loss. If I'm a championship level team then being able to switch in the highest leverage games is more important so having a rudy gobert or brook lopez type is going to be less appealing.
Zero point in arguing about Simmons on this Sub. Like 3 years ago I said he wouldn’t improve to anything better than a 30% shooter from 3 and I got absolutely shit on with everyone comparing him to Brook Lopez
My guy brook lopez
He's shooting over a third of his shots from 3. Brook Lopez shot 43% from the field last year. Obviously 37 percent is bad but that's mostly because he's shot terribly on 3s so far.
His rant about Brook Lopez and the rest of the Bucks last year was legitimately First Take Youtube comments levels of analysis and somehow he’s still paid to do thus
Last year Hassan Whiteside and Brook Lopez were the top 2 in blocks.
Yea look at Brook Lopez who extended his range to the three point land
"Dwight Howard, Marc Gasol, Robin Lopez, Brook Lopez, Zubac, McGee, R Williams, Favours, etc."
They have done more different things but one of the fundamental approaches to the scheme is they are transparent about the fact that very few bigs in this league are actual floor spacers with real gravity the way people often claim.   Brook Lopez playing off bigs and being in the paint “2.9ing” plus Giannis being a weak side help defender roaming is still a lot of what this defense is built on. And that comes down to leaving all these Myles Turner type bigs who people claim are floor spacers wide open because they know the vast majority of bigs even if they’d shoot 35-36% don’t actually want to take 10 3s in a game and won’t. That’s where a lot of it traces back to they give up tons of 3s but the premise of the defense is built on the idea they know guys they leave open will still pass up 3s and not pay them pay for it  The personnel is made to switching in many ways and being more creative with perimeter defense. Bud finally seems to have some recognition of that although let’s see what happens from him in the playoffs
"AD isn't an amazing post player, he's good, very good even, but a lot of center are better pure post player, KAT is better at this, Brook Lopez, Vucevic or Kanter are probably as good"
"Not saying he'd still be the best, but Brook Lopez was great in the post. Not sure if he really does it anymore since he started shooting threes.   He was also really good in the PnR and scoring off cuts. Wish we could've seen a Brook Lopez that used that full offensive repertoire."
"Augustin is a decent regular season backup PG, but he’s also 5-11 and 33 years old and has a concerning recent injury history. His shot I believe in despite the struggles last year, but I don’t see him staying on the floor in a series against most contenders. I worry about him being one of those old PGs gritting his way through a bunch of leg injuries deep in the season and being a complete disaster defensively.  Forbes is a great shooter, but one of the worst defensive players in the league.  Portis is never going to have the bball IQ or fundamentals of Brook Lopez. He’s been a traffic cone on defense his entire career so far. His shot selection and bad decisions are also a nightmare in tight games. I love his spirit though, and his scoring outbursts are fun.  I don’t think Connaughton belongs in a playoff rotation, and I think that sentiment is pretty much universal among Bucks fans.  I fucking love Nwora though. He’s gonna be a steal. But I think betting on the 45th pick to be a winning player in his Rookie season is a long shot."
"Tim Duncan had elite defensive positioning which helped cover the loss of speed at that stage of his career. Same with players like Marc Gasol and Brook Lopez now. They're slow and get burned in the high PnR, but they're great help defenders/rim protectors."
"Augustin is a solid veteran PG off the bench to led the second unit and Bobby Portis could be Brook Lopez light, he just needs to be more involved defensively. Also, Forbes is no slouch either, especially once the Bucks gel more. Connaughton has his good days but he's so inconsistent.  The Bucks could also stagger Jrue and Middleton by giving one early rest in the first leaving the other in the second unit to start the second quarter.  The hidden gem of the Bucks though is Jordan Nwora.  Jordan Nwora plays so smooth, under control, and has a deadly stroke. I would like to see the Bucks use him more off the dribble as well. The future of the NBA is developing your young players as quickly as possible to counter injuries to starters by plugging-and-playing guys, especially in the endless grind that is the modern fast-paced NBA. I could see him fighting DiVincenzo for minutes if he gets more playing time and continues to stay engaged on defense.   The Bucks are truly ten deep, they just need more of the season to become acclimated with one another."
Brook Lopez wishes he was as good as Vuc.
Reminds me of brook lopez
"Oh right. How could I forget. That's a really strong team. You could have a pretty deep line-up of:  * Coach: Pau * C: Marc/Brook &amp; Robin Lopez/Cody &amp; Tyler Zeller * Wings: Giannis/Marcus &amp; Markieff/Justin Holiday/Thanasis/Kostas/Caleb &amp; Cody Martin * Guards: Steph/Jrue/Lonzo &amp; LaMelo Ball/Seth/Aaron Holiday  Would have to send some of these guys to the G-League affiliate, since it's over 15 now.  This team is definitely a championship caliber team."
"Role players deserve more respect. Not everyone can be a star, but players that can be vital role players for teams(Ibaka, Tony Allen, Fournier, Seth, etc) or become them later on in their career(Marc, Brook Lopez, Carter, Conley) deserve much more respect than they get. They'll never get the admiration of stars, but they're invaluable as a whole."
"Brook Lopez is just famous for molesting the teams mascots. Tingus Pingus doesn’t even play, so he can’t be better. Aldridge is washed. Gobert, anyone even heard of this dude? KAT is a traffic come on D. Ayton is nowhere compared to his draft buddies Luka and Young"
Fox/Levert/Derrick Jones Jr./John Collins/Brook Lopez
And despite all that he still gets schemed out of the game like Siakam lmaoo  Imagine getting outplayed by not only Middleton but geriatric Brook Lopez
" Ill name more than 5 better than him Gobert, Embiid, Jokic, Kat, Nikola Vucevic, Ayton, Brook Lopez, Aldridge, Porzingis    Need more?"
Lmfao.   Anyway thanks for making me realize KD and Kyrie had to ask permission from Nets Legends Jeremy Lin and Brook Lopez to wear their numbers
Brook Lopez and Robin Lopez
"From behind, Luwawu-Cabbaro looks like a 6'6 Brook Lopez."
"His defense is not that bad.  People are really overdoing it.  Only thing I would say is he is not someone who can guard AD, Embiid. He’s not a Brook Lopez or Gasol in the paint, he’s scrawny"
"Lakers FT shooting curse must be real. That team was so fucking bad at free throws: Kuzma, Ingram, Randle, Lonzo, Brook Lopez, Josh Hart, even KCP was under 80% that year. And then they brought in LeBron lmao probably the most famous poor shooting FT super star (non-big).  Luckily AD and KCP broke the curse."
"2017 they still had Kristaps, Noah (of course he became a tire fire but at the time there was still some hope he could be at least solid), Frank Ntilikina (who was just drafted with high hopes)   2018 Knicks had DeAndre Jordan, Dennis Smith Jr. (thought to be a future star), Frank Ntilikina (who still had more hope back then) and Mitchell Robinson   76ers:  2013: ROY MCW, Nerlens Noel (granted he was hurt but still had that hope)  2014: Noel, Robert Covington, Joel Embiid (missed year but still carried massive hope)   2015: Noel, Covington, Embiid (still hurt), Jalil Okafor (was still an all rookie guy with upside at time)  2016: Covington, Embiid, Saric (decently regarded draft and stash guy playing his first year), Simmons (hurt the whole year but still was a hopeful impact guy)   Nets 10 years ago had Brook Lopez"
"When Luke Walton finally figured out how play Randle correctly in 2017-18, we went from an 11-27 team to a 24-20 the rest of the way (took Luke 3 months to realize that playing Randle w/ the rim protect, floor stretching Brook Lopez would completely open his game up, fucking idiot). Dude can be a key contributor on a winning team if he's focused on both sides &amp; put in a position to succeed."
I'll go 6 Brook Lopez' and just pack the paint.
"&gt; They were considered busts until they went to other teams  Not by competent GMs they weren't. The Nets wouldn't have been willing to trade Brook Lopez and Kyle Kuzma for Timofey Mozgov's horrid contract if they thought they were getting a bust in D'lo as the sweetner. The Pels wouldn't have traded Anthony Davis if the centerpiece of the trade was a guy they thought was a bust.   The only reason these guys were considered ""busts"" is because Laker haters like yourself wanted to call them that, no matter how promising they looked or how well they were playing. Guys like you were saying shit like ""he's a bust"" from day one, and you never moved off that until they weren't on the Lakers anymore and then immediately your narrative changed to ""the Lakers fucked up by trading such a promising young player!"""
"&gt;Thinking the Lakers had they not brought in LeBron would be a playoff team in the West is preposterous.  It's not remotely.  They were 12 games out of playoff spot in 2018 -- starting two 20 year-olds, and one each 22, 23, and 24.  Only 1 player over 25 played over 700 minutes for that team -- Brook Lopez.  That was one of the youngest NBA teams in recent history, when weighted by minutes-played.  They were barely older than a college team.  They also had 20 year-old Ivica Zubac and 20 year-old Thomas Bryant.  They traded Zubac to make room for Davis, and he immediately started for the playoff-bound Clippers.  Bryant is starting in Washington -- who are not a playoff team, but he'd certainly be a capable backup.  They also would've had plenty of cap space to re-sign Brook Lopez, who is also capable of starting on a playoff team.  Plus Ingram, Randle, Ball, Caldwell-Pope, Hart, Kuzma, Caruso, Clarkson, and Hunter -- all guys currently playing well for various teams.  Or, they could package some of those assets -- with the 3 firsts and second round picks they used on Davis -- to acquire other players.  For just two examples, they had more disposable assets than Miami needed to trade for Jimmy Butler and still had more than Indiana needed to trade for Malcolm Brogdon.  Just to name two very good players who have recently been on the trade market for much, much less than the Lakers spent on one season of Davis.  They were on their way back to playoffs, even without James -- exactly because of the original topic here, they drafted very well year after year, and that left them with a wealth of young assets."
Well the bucks chose not to give him that role similarly how they waiting so long go give giannis the full time center role where hes best at as a roll man who can also start the fast break. Brook lopez is a poor pnr defender. Better to have perimeter players
What about the other way around? Especially in the playoffs where Lopez has out performed Giannis in the tough series?  Having Brook anchor the defense allows Giannis to roam as freely as he does.
Brook lopez finished top 10 in dpoy voting...but go off
Lets bench Brook Lopez and play Kuz at center.
"For all those saying Joel Embiid, come back when he can play more than 64 games in a season. Don’t get me wrong, his stats are pretty good, actually really good, but when he can play(not start, just play) more games, like KAT, Jokic, Bam, and he’ll even Brook and Robin Lopez, then he’ll be the best in the league by a loooooonnnnnggg shot. Until then I’m still going to say Joel Embiid."
I’m not worried about his shot but it’s not that clear.  The pacers starters are all very good.  Hawks have bogdan or capela though capela hasn’t looked like hou capela so far.  Brook lopez and Marcus smart are very impactful defenders
Brook Lopez impacts the game a lot more than other 4th options
I don’t think he’s the best but Brook Lopez is in this category.
Why do people say Brook Lopez can't rebound when he was the 3rd best center in PnR last year?
Its Brook Lopez.   Robin Lopez is in the GLeague
Brook Lopez is the leading scorer in Nets history.  Should they retire his number? Legit question..
"How many players in this era of the NBA, especially high usage perimeter guys, are as good and as prolific at every other type of jumpshot but as poor/reluctant at 3s as DeRozan? Closest I can think of is Brook Lopez before he started shooting 3s but he wasn't quite as good as DeRozan from other ranges and he plays in a completely different role... plus he obviously did end up extending his range. Reality is I'm sure Simmons and DeRozan are both trying behind the scenes, I just think it's ridiculous for Toronto fans to push the whole ""lazy diva Simmons doesn't care enough for our amazing gritty culture"" thing when one of their greatest most adored players is so much more stubborn and outspoken about not fixing a much more fixable problem"
"Nets Brook Lopez was something, man"
Brook Lopez is eternal
I'm still mad brook lopez was hurt that last year. I wanted to see him do work against the heat
"That was a year after carrying us (Nets) to the second round of the playoffs when everyone had written the team off, Brook Lopez injured, Deron Williams underwhelming and Garnett a shell of himself. He really became such a great defender and clutch shooter from the 4 position in those last couple years."
He coached one of the best teams without a star player ever in the 2015 hawks lol Bud came in with Brook Lopez in 2018/19 and turned a seventh seed into the top team in the nba literally overnight. Didn’t Dantoni coach the knicks in a even worse east conference? They were garbage. How will Dantoni look without 2 mvp caliber players in his starting line up? I’m not saying buds way better or the best coach in the league just saying he’s better.
And why were you able to give Brook a 10 million dollar raise then? Stop avoiding engaging in the premise of my point they secured Lopez at a higher rate of pay because their core was cost controlled.  And calling me dumbass to start every comment aint cute either ive had this account for almost 10 years Ive heard it all by now lmao
"Dear Dumbass.  Have a think about the Bucks without Brook Lopez, PJ Tucker, Pat Connaughton and Bobby Portis.  To quote some Daryl Morey or other, the scarce resource in the NBA is not the star player, it is the undervalued player.  And Ben Simmons is being paid a max."
What ? Shooting a corner three when you're standing there waiting for it.  You need to watch more Brook Lopez :)
Kawhi better passing  Brook Lopez perimeter defense  Morant and Fox 3 point shooting  CJ McCollum perimeter defense
"I think you’re overestimating how many legit bully ball centers there are in the playoffs. The east had brook lopez and The west had Jokic and Jonas.   Most playoff centers are guys Zubac, Griffin, Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Noel, Capela etc."
"I’m guessing it’s a buy low-sell high kind of thing. Small-ball has been dominant the last decade, so bigs are relatively cheap, but it wouldn’t take much for that trend to change. In fact, with Giannis dominating in the finals, aided by effective performances from Brook Lopez and Bobby Portis, there may be a run on bigs by contenders. If so, Cleveland is poised to make bank. So it’s a gamble, but it may be one that’s about to pay off…"
"Simmons provided you have the shooting elsewhere..Lonzo is at best the third best player in a championship team..I still think Simmons can be the best player in a champion ship roster with the right pieces around.. To me a team with perhaps something like Brogdon, McCollum, Grant, Simmons and brook lopez can be legit contenders"
The Lakers traded D'Lo and Mozgov for Brook Lopez and Kyle Kuzma. It was mainly a way to salary dump Mozgov with 3 years and $48 million left on his contract.
Say other things like we need to trade for Brook Lopez for a 2nd rounder or some shit to make it happen
I agree with most of what you say about Dwight but I think you need to look at context for those All-NBA teams. Being an All-NBA 1st team center is easier in the Bynum/Brook Lopez era than the Hakeem/Shaq/Robinson era
"Gotta disagree there. Dwight was the clear best center of his generation and Robinson wasn’t. Ok, so ?  Dwight was competing with one season of peak Bynum, old ass Shaq and Brook Lopez  Robinson was competing with peak Hakeem, Ewing, Mutombo and early prime Shaq  Not a good argument imo."
"Isn't Holmes like 28?  I also think this conversation has it kind of weird.  Allen is a strong defender and maybe he'll develop enough of a 3pt shot to be useful a la Brook Lopez, but the thing that makes him unique is his offensive efficiency.  He is already one of the two or three most efficient bigs in NBA history.  His TS% last year was the equivalent of early Steph years where it just kind of looks fake on the box score, like somebody made those stats up.   If Cleveland hadn't payed him that somebody else would have, there's definitely something unique going on with him."
I’d go Lopez twins because I see Brook as the best out of the 4 by a fair margin
People don't value centers. They think cause Brook Lopez plays for 12mil a season every team should have their own strech big/rim portector for pennies. He's the extreme exception not the norm.   For the rest of the bottom dwellers they paying 20mil to Jarret Allens in the hopes he becomes even 1/2 of Lopez eventually
From game 7 against the Nets on Giannis took guys on the block constantly.  Not to mention what Brook Lopez did to the Hawks. And how is a post up slower than a pick &amp; roll. Thats just nonsense.
Damn first time i realised i've never actually heard of a guy named brook before knowing about lopez.  Well and the skeleton character from one piece but he ain't got no genitals anymore so i dunno if he counts.
Brook Lopez at $12M. Richaun Holmes.
Is brook lopez secretly way underpaid...
"""Hey boss, the trail went cold on the Lopez twins, I think they ended up in witness protection.""   ""They're 7-foot-tall twin professional basketball players with active contracts, how hard is it to find those guys?""   ""Well the Bucks cut Brook &amp; signed some guy named Luke Skywalker, who's also 7 feet tall but has a shaved head &amp; wears glasses.""  ""Damn, what are the odds?"""
"Exactly. Sometimes shots don't fall. Sometimes you have a bad game. If Simmons tried to improve and shot even 1/5 from 3p every single game, I'd bet money that even Sixers fans would support him and say ""You know what? He's trying. That's good, he'll get there.""       I mean shit, in his first 8 seasons, Brook Lopez attempted a total of 31 threes. After 2015-16, he realized the way the league was trending and decided that being a threat from deep would evolve his game and help his teams. He's now a career 34% 3 point shooter and has attempted 1,830 threes total, starting in 2016-17.       Same story with Marc Gasol. Didn't start shooting 3's in any meaningful way until his 9th season (also 2016-17). Is now a career 36% 3-point shooter.        Countless examples of guys realizing they need to make adjustments as soon as they notice a trend or the way the game is evolving, but Ben absolutely refuses despite being begged by everybody."
"He’s only 25, but most players who develop 3pt shots later in their career were decent midrange shooters before that. Even centers like Brook Lopez and Chris Bosh were very good midrange shooters and just stretch their range. Going from no outside shot at all is a huge jump"
"Q: What’s the next step for Ben Simmons?      Chris: “Shoot it. That’s it. Shoot it. Shoot it. That’s all he needs to do is shoot it, I’m telling you. I did it for 13 years in the league, man, and it didn’t steer me wrong. Shoot it. He has the playmaking ability, he is unselfish. It’s wonderful that he’s a team player. But for him to get to where he wants to go, he’s going to have to shoot the ball. I think he’s more than capable. Once he proves that he’s a threat out there, Brook Lopez and DeAndre Jordan and all those bigs, they can’t just be in the middle of the paint playing traffic cop."
1 season is too short make any judgement on improved shooting. I mean didn't Klay one of the greatest shooter ever shot like low 30% from 3 for 20-30 games then got back to 42%. I mean remember brook Lopez first season as a buck where he shot close to 37% from 3 then immediately the next two season he shot 32 and 34.
"Brook Lopez comes to mind, never thought he’d turn into such a prolific 3 point shooter"
Id be fine if he shot like Brook lopez. Doesn't need to attempt many but occasionally makes an open 3.
"Not as consistently but brook lopez, Jrue at times and guys like PJ tucker, pat connaughton weren't bad from three. So I don't its just middleton"
"Not true at all. He got in because he deserved it.   The people who could have got in over him (eg, got similar votes and had similar numbers) were Deron Williams and Monta Ellis.   Pre All-Star break 22yr old Jrue was averaging 19.7/4.2/8.9 on .451/.353/.755 (.512 TS%) shooting. He was the only half way decent player on a crumby 76ers team that was 22-29 going into the ASB. The next best player on that team was either 24 yr old Evan Turner or 24 yr old Thad Young.    Deron was averaging 16.7/3.3/7.6 on .413/.347/.855 (.542 TS%). He was the 2nd/3rd option offensively behind Brook Lopez (who got All-Star that year as a replacement for Rondo being injured) and Joe Johnson. That was a good Brooklyn team that was 32-22 going into the break. He came back with a vengeance post ASB and averaged 22.9/2.5/8.0 on .622 TS% the second half of the year, with the Nets finishing the season 49-33. However, his pre ASB numbers were about the same as Jrue, slightly more efficient but less counting stats - I'd say its a wash on the numbers. Jrue was a much better defender at this point of their respective careers also. The record was better on the Nets front, but they weren't a top seed, and Brook was the one with more All-Star buzz, hence why he got put in after Rondo went down.  Monta was averaging 18.4/3.8/5.5 on an absolutely woeful .401/.232/.796 (.474 TS%) shooting numbers. The bucks record was slightly better than the 76ers but Monta had a reputation as a chucker on offense who didn't play any D, so he wasn't getting put in by coaches who select the bench all stars.  There was somewhat of an argument for Deron over Jrue, but to act like Jrue is silly imo. If you think he didn't deserve it, I'd be interested to know who you would put in over him. Jrue was clearly the best player on his team putting up great counting stats, on a team that was pretty bad. But there weren't really any other guards out there putting up similar numbers on better teams - out side of Deron whose team mate got the nod over him."
"Manu Ginobili vs Brook ""I wanna get bitten by a bat"" Lopez  That's a duel that i would like to see"
I feel like you can always tell the bandwagoners because they hate Brook Lopez.
"As a Nets fan around 2012 in high school. They played in Newark. Brook Lopez (legend) was their best and only player.  Tickets cost literally $2 on StubHub. I'd go to games with friends only to play a shooting contest in the hallways. The contest cost $5. If you made enough shots within 60 seconds, you won an autographed brook Lopez shoe. It was so much fucking fun Thinking back, more fans were invested in this contest than the actual NBA game The contest also cost twice as much as a ticket to the NBA game"
"&gt; Terrible game one, but seeing as he nearly doubled his percentage in game two and was slowly becoming more efficient as the series went on, I kinda don't see how this is the definitive series that points to Bam being worse than Simmons ... I kinda don't see how this is the definitive series that points to Bam being worse than Simmons.  While he improved in games 3 &amp; 4, Bam shot 45.6% from the field in the entire series. He also had an assist/turnover ratio of 1.5, while Ben's was 3.07.   &gt; With Simmons, his poor shooting, and reticence regarding scoring has been documented over the last few years. The Altanta series was, as I said, icing on the cake and a coach targeting his weakness.   Like I said earlier, Bam has also exhibited the same problem his whole career, and has even admitted to it limiting his team.  &gt; By no means is Bam perfect, but i'd argue its harder to make a gameplan solely around exploiting one of this weaknesses and have it be THAT effective.  Mike Budenholzer actually gameplanned solely around exploiting his main weaknesses, rim aversion and scoring hesitancy, by always matching him up with Brook Lopez, and it was THAT effective.  &gt; The narrative around him and his team is that he is supposed to be #2 on a championship caliber team ... Ben has to be the 2nd scoring option. Who else?   This is inaccurate, as Ben was initially supposed to be the second scoring option, but was relieved of that role with the arrival of Tobias Harris, who immediately becames the Sixers' second option."
"Brook lopez should retire during a Brooklyn vs bucks game. He should play for each team for 1 half, and attempt/miss 1 fg each. Then he can be the first player to have his jersey retired by two teams at once"
Brook Lopez has a brother who infamously purchased clothing stolen from a Disney World animatronic.
"damn i thought brook lopez was from fresno, guess they just went to hs there"
"Thats very true, but imagine how good you gotta be to even be considered coming from the Ivy League conference.  This guy also led his team to the winning the CA state championship.  He was an all-state pick (1st team) with James Harden and over Russell Westbrook (3rd team) and Brook Lopez (3rd team).  This is an asian kid from northern California and the CA state championship is one of the toughest to win."
"I love Nance, his effort for the Lakers was fun to watch with the other young core. Also his animal like dunks on people really made those like 30 win seasons fun to watch.  My two favs: KD https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XncEQeUnQc Brook Lopez: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pqfvWthszA"
"If we had a capable stretch five, I’d agree with you. Problem is, neither Markannen or Love are capable of guarding centers either. Only good defensive big we’ve got is Allen, and trying to get the Fro to play the four on offense isn’t a great proposition. If we had Brook Lopez or someone like that, I’d be entirely on board with it."
"""look at larry nance"" seriously my fave play was when he dunked over brook lopez. That shit was fire plus his face after was hilarious"
"KAT’s definitely a below average defender for a starting center. There are 30 starting centers, and there’s definitely more than 15 that are better defenders than him.   I don’t know anything about some of the less known starters, but just listing out who’s better than him on defense:   Marc Gasol/Dwight Howard  Jakob Poetl  Robert Williams  Mason Plumlee  Steven Adams  Ivaca Zubac  Mitchell Robinson  Richaun Holmes  Brook Lopez  Valanciunas  Jarrett Allen   Myles Turner  Nurkic   Capela   Ayton  Bam  Gobert  Embiid   That’s 18 teams whose starting centers are pretty easily better defenders than KAT, and there are several others that I’d put above him but are debatable"
"uh injured James Harden and Blake Griffin vs Jrue Holiday Khris Middleton and tbh Brook Lopez playing better than Blake too is not ""even"""
"Brook Lopez, Bobby Portis, and Giannis Antetokounmpo minutes at C."
Nah Kevin's gonna get some of that 2019 Brook Lopez resurgence magic.
Randle as a second option with Mitchell you buffoon.   Alongside Brook Lopez they might’ve made the finals last year.
Those 21 points ppg were mostly like peak inefficient midrange shots that put zero pressure on defense. People really imagine Barg as this modern Brook Lopez but can shoot even better when he was at his “best” as the anti-analytic midrange iso scorer
Brook Lopez and his wide shoulders boxing out everyone
robin lopez + another egg also being fertilized = brook lopez
Brook Lopez + Clint Capela = Embiid  Michael Jordan + Kwame Brown = Khris Middleton
Chris Boucher     Brook Lopez     Myles Turner
robin lopez + mason plumlee = brook lopez
The Utah Jazz won't even make the playoffs if Brook Lopez was their center.
"Uh I can literally get Brook Lopez for 13m and get near the same thing, plus actual 3point shooting and offense. Or I can get Capela for 18m.   My point is giving the max to a extremely limited rim protector is not the way to build a championship team."
"I don't think Bud was anywhere close to being fired. I've regularly gotten flamed on this sub for insinuating that he's not absolute garbage juice as a coach. He has a 4 out offensive system that's pretty complex to run, and somehow schemes to have slow ass Brook Lopez not get ass blasted on every possession defensively."
Stretch bigs:  Kevin love  Brook lopez  Karl anthony towns
"I was thinking of Simmons as I wrote this as he went 3-10 last year from three. That’s better than 2-14 or whatever Brook shot in 2015-2016.   Granted Lopez had incredible touch even then and was an accomplished mid-range shooter. Ben Simmons takes one shot a game from over 8 feet out, soooo..   The Magic Eight Ball would say, “Outlook, not so good.”"
"Brook Lopez is a great example, that guy completely changed his game seemingly between seasons, you have to respect it.   I was impressed with Blake Griffins change in game style change when he went to Detroit. He added a 3 point shot and became this ball handling forward mold that was pretty unique and way different from his previous style. I respected his willingness to adjust."
Brook Lopez v Deandre Jordan
I’ve never seen a player change play styles as drastically as Brook Lopez did. He went from being a post beast traditional big man to basically exclusively being a stretch big
Bucks went from bottom 10 in team rebounds per game to number 1 the last 3 years in a row as soon as they signed Lopez on the team. He does his job by boxing out the other teams best rebounder. Giannis RPG shot up from like 8 per game to 12 as soon as Brook came here. Casuals don't understand this.
"Vucci Mane makes me laugh every time.  Best, though? I'd probably go with Splash Mountain for Brook Lopez, or the Bald Eagle for Alex Caruso."
"Brook Lopez was a straight up monster for the Nets, this man had post moves and a mid range game,  he had some really great games against the Celtics."
"They've had comparable rosters, outside of khris Middleton on Jrue this year everyone has been a role players/journeymen   Eric bledsoe,Bryn Forbes,sterling brown, pat connaughton, brook lopez,bobby Portis,George hill and a bunch of other people who either aren't in the league or deep bench players"
Brook Lopez appreciation post
Brook Lopez
But Ben Simmons has less drive than Brook Lopez
"I mean, Ben Simmons is also more talented than Brook Lopez"
"If Brook Lopez could learn how to shoot threes, Michael Jordan could learn how to shoot threes."
You’re the mid range version or Brook Lopez
"How? Some schemes need specific players for it to work. You can’t run switching coverages if you have Brook Lopez at center, you can’t run drop coverage with Nic Batum at center. That’s just common basketball sense, not just any player can stop a physical freak like Giannis this isn’t some Gotcha moment. The recency bias and overconfidence in whatever the take of the month is really annoying on here. Giannis is a better player than he was in 2019 or 2020 but to just ignore those years because he played teams with worse defenders and rim protectors this year in Atlanta, Brooklyn and Phoenix and pretending he can’t be schemed against by the best coaches in the league is an interesting take."
"Embiid can shoot 3’s but I wouldn’t call him a “stretch 5” he operates inside. He’s not like a Brook Lopez who will chill in the corner to stretch the floor. The backup centers Ben has been given are Boban, Greg Monroe, Dwight Howard, and now Andre Drummond. When Embiid got hurt, Ben’s rookie year, they played ersan illyasova at the 5 and Ben played like an MVP. Yes he can’t shoot. All non prime LeBron players have flaws. Imagine they made Giannis play with any of those guys now. People would shit on the FO not Giannis."
That’s because they had Brook Lopez and KCP who started the most games.  35 in an 82 game season is pretty much the same as 31 on a 72 game season. Both teams didn’t make the playoffs and were 11th seed.
"Here is my quick attempt off the top of my head,  *Sabonis does not count even though he is American born. He represents Lithuania internationally and clearly has embraced that culture, his dad was just playing in the States when he was born.  1st Team  Tyler Herro- Joe Harris- Duncan Robinson- Gordon Hayward- Brook Lopez  2nd Team  Alex Caruso- Kevin Huerter- Pat Connaughton- Kevin Love- Cody Zeller  3rd Team  TJ McConnell- JJ Redick- Doug McDermott- Zach Collins- Mason Plumlee or Frank Kaminsky  The issue is that there are much better guards than forwards and especially centers. I feel like Donte is probably better than JJ at this point, but I gave Redick the legacy choice."
"good answer but so are Kris Middleton, Brook Lopez and Jrue.  [Also never forget Bobby Portis high fiving the guy that blocked him.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ocfglz/highlight_bobby_portis_is_the_kind_of_guy_that/)"
No no no coach bud mind controlled Brook Lopez
Point guard would be Andre Miller.     Shooting guard Jamal Murray.      Small forward Rick Fox.      Power forward Horace Grant.     Center Brook Lopez (back when he played post).       This answer is NOT wrong.
and Brook Lopez
"If I be a bucks fan, they could give Brook Lopez a max and I still be happy."
Giannis and KAT is the best front court of all time. KAT is like brook lopez except like way better at filling the shooter role. He fits perfect.
"Because he is a center that is average defensively, center is the one position where defense &gt; offense, he's already an all time offensive player, but for many people (me included) there is this perception that being average (or worst) defensively puts a hard ceiling on a defense.  Here are the guys that have closed games for recent NBA champs at center: Brook Lopez/Giannis, AD/Howard, Marc Gasol/Ibaka, Draymond, Tristan, Duncan, Bosh, Chandler, Gasol/Bynum, Perkins/KG, Shaq, Ben Wallace/Sheed.  Most of those guys were all defense level, and at worst they excelled at one part of defense (switching for Tristan, rim protection for Shaq, Bynum and Pau). Jokic doesn't really have a big strenght defensively, he can be targetted in most schemes"
"See thats the issue here, its not exactly about his versatility but mostly to act on the moment and cover the weakness that was created or predicted to happen. Its very hard to explain.  Imagine a situation where Giannis is on perimeter guarding his guy but predicts/see Lopez for example losing his guy and reacts to the play by either blocking the offensive player or totally closing down the door that he made by passing Brook/other Bucks player.   Im not sure how to explain myself better ( English is no my mother language ) so i apologize for the confusion."
I find it hard to believe 1 of Brook Lopez or Bobby Portis isn't too 125.
"What did LA do to ""build"" a team around LeBron other than tamper AD out of NOLA mid-season and then sign buyout players and ring chasing veterans (that only ever choose big market teams)??? Oh yeah, they had literally the worst offseason of ANY team in the past decade, they gave hundreds of millions to Luol Deng and fucking Mozgov (isn't Deng STILL on your books lmaooooo) Had Brook Lopez on a steal of a contract... completely failed to utilize him and had him walk for nothing. Great fucking team building, they really auditioned perfectly for LeBron with moves like that, on top of being the worst fucking team in the whole league for almost a decade straight. Please either stop commenting or delete your account. You're doing nothing but embarrassing yourself even further."
My impulses were with Kenyon or Brook Lopez. I feel like with KD at the 4 you almost have to pick brook Lopez.
Brook Lopez
Brook Lopez baby
"2014 Nets in modern day would be nuts.   PG: Deron Williams, Jason Terry, Shaun Livingston   SG: Joe Johnson, Marcus Thornton  SF: Paul Pierce, Teletovic  PF: Andrei Kirilenko, Andrey Blatche, Reggie Evans  C:  Kevin Garnett, Brook Lopez, Mason Plumlee"
"Old Shaq is kinda the cheat code to this: the '09 Suns could run Nash-Dragic-Grant Hill-Amare-Shaq, with Matt Barnes/Barbosa/Jason Richardson/Robin Lopez off the bench (with MVP of my heart Stromile Swift dunking on everyone in garbage time).   Honorable mention: obviously the '11 Mavs won the title, but prime Kidd-Peja-Marion-Dirk-Chandler with Terry/Caron Butler off the bench would be fun.  Other honorable mention: '14 Brooklyn Nets: Deron-Joe Johnson-Pierce-KG-Brook Lopez, with Kirilenko and Mason Plumlee off the bench (and Jason Kidd because I want to include coaches in this hypothetical)"
"I can tell you are trash at basketball by your comments.  Which is fine, just know that anyone who is good at basketball and knows who Tim Duncan is would not say something so stupid.  So how is Brook Lopez the better Team USA center?"
Taking the Clippers to 7 with the team that Luka was carrying is is on similar levels to what the Hawks did.  Also Mickey Mouse playoff run  Beat future Shanghai Shark Julius Randle  Beat a young socialite   Got shit on by Brook Lopez
"brook lopez on robin lopez: ""we are twins, we're just different colors."""
"The biggest misconception ever is that Brook Lopez has ever been a great post player. He mostly has 1 move (a turn over left shoulder for a righty hook). He used to be able to drop step or do an awkward spin sometimes, but overall his post game sucks. Robins is way better now than Brooks ever was on the nets. The only exception to this is when Brook bulked up to 290 pounds the season KG and Pierce joined the team and was just able to move everyone out of the way in the post with his size. Too bad he broke his foot like 15 games into the season.   &amp;#x200B;  Brooks scoring was best in space with mid range jumpers and long floaters, in the pick and roll/pop situation, diving to the basket,  and beating other bigs off the dribble when they closed out too hard. His post scoring was meh."
"&gt;Nope. I know Gobert is better. I simply picked someone else that is also a top tier defensive center because everyone else would be saying the same answer (as well as the FT thing). Why do you think I picked someone like Klay over Thybulle even though the latter rn is the safer pick? It's simply more fun when everyone isn't giving the same exact answers on topic like this. That's just my thing.  brook is a good defensive center, gobert is an all-time great defensive center. there is already differences in people's responses, and it's far more interesting when those differences are justifiable in ways other than simply to be different. people could put lonzo in since ""well everyone is putting the same few guards in so i'm going to be different."" but in a post about best defensive teams that is simply unjustifiable. there is space to argue between players at similar levels defensively, there is no space to argue when one is clearly significantly better than the other.  &gt;I see things that I don't agree or think is dumb on this sub(any sub) all of the time, but I don't go around immediately insulting people for it. You know......like a person that isn't a blatant jerk and actually has a ounce of maturity would do? Like holy shit dude how socially stunted are you? You could have just disagreed, but nope, you had to be try and make it personal because that's just who you are. Pathetic. Here's hoping you are in fact a kid like I think you are because if you're an adult........yikes, you've got some catching up to do.  i'm sorry but putting brook lopez over gobert is idiotic.  &gt;It'd be stupid if I didn't have 2 specific reasons for my picks and I actually was making an argument that Lopez was better overall.....but I do and I'm not. And the answer was yes, you were going to double down more because of course someone like you would. You've got nothing for me.  so one reason is ""i don't want to choose the same people"" which as i explained earlier is bad reasoning. the second is ft% which i've already talked about and just isn't a reasonable argument in a post where it's talking purely defensively. like you can likely find 2 reasons to argue 1 player is greater than any other player, it doesn't make those reasons justified. like let's say if i wanted to say donovan mitchell is better than MJ, well 1 reason could be he's a better 3pt shooter, and maybe for a second i could argue well since if you asked a group of nba fans this question they'd pretty much all say MJ was better, well it would be boring if everyone said the same thing so that's a second reason why i'd say donovan mitchell is better. Can you see how that's poor reasoning for an argument that donovan mitchell is better than MJ?"
"&gt;the post is about creating the best defensive team, you imply they are close by putting brook in rather than gobert. You are essentially implying that they are similar enough for two players who will not have the ball in the hands in late game situations, and us such will not be the ones fouled most often in close game scenarios, for an extra 0.3 of a point per free throw trip to be mean brook is a better choice.  Nope. I know Gobert is better. I simply picked someone else that is also a top tier defensive center because everyone else would be saying the same answer (as well as the FT thing). Why do you think I picked someone like Klay over Thybulle even though the latter rn is the safer pick? It's simply more fun when everyone isn't giving the same exact answers on topic like this.

"&gt;So I guess you were too busy having your little REEEEE episode because I never even implied that they were close either. First you act like how you did and now you're trying to say I said something I didn't? Boy you must be one miserable person to talk to.  the post is about creating the best defensive team, you imply they are close by putting brook in rather than gobert. You are essentially implying that they are similar enough for two players who will not have the ball in the hands in late game situations, and us such will not be the ones fouled most often in close game scenarios, for an extra 0.3 of a point per free throw trip to be mean brook is a better choice.  &gt;No you didn't. There was no need for you to be triggered about it and for you to think that's a reasonable just cements how much of a embarrassing childish person you are. No one teach you any better? You're free to be how you are, but don't make the idiotic mistake of thinking you're being ""reasonable"". Lol, now THAT'S a stupid take.  i wasn't triggered i called you an idiot. you're free to be an idiot, but you can't complain when people call you one.  &gt;Lopez has been one of the better starting defense players in the league. I'm aware he's not as good as Gobert, but I already laid out the 2 reasons I put Brook there. You going to fuck off or are you just going to double down more?  brook is a good center yes, gobert is atleast top 5 center in the league and defensively the best center.  so are you going to accept you putting brook instead of gobert was stupid or are you going to double down more."
"&gt;Yeah the three time dpoy and 5 time first all defense is really close to a one time second team all defense.

Lol, now THAT'S a stupid take.  &gt;Let's say someone asked for a team based solely around offence and I put Jordan clarkson in there despite the fact that there are obviously far better choices to be made, since he is not one of the top 4 offensive guards, do you really think that is reasonable? I mean he can score, but he's clearly not good enough to be in a ""best offensive players"" team. That's the equivalent of what you've done.  Lopez has been one of the better starting defense players in the league. I'm aware he's not as good as Gobert, but I already laid out the 2 reasons I put Brook there. You going to fuck off or are you just going to double down more?"
Robin and Brook Lopez: Eat Pez candy off the floor
"Bro😭you cannot compare a team of Bledsoe(good in the regular season), Middleton(all star), Brogdon, and Brook Lopez to Roberson and Adams. OKC had dipo, sabonis and grant too but they were all two years too early to becoming good players. Don’t see how that’s even close to Giannis having a very solid roster."
"If all of your possessions late in a close game are being used up by a player missing their FTs, then the clock is going to be stopped and the other team is going to have more possessions to score the ball.   And like I said, I didn't want to pick the same team as everyone else. Everyone would be picking Gobert, Thy, Simmons, Smart etc. And lol you say ""Brook fucking Lopez"" like he's some chump when he's been an All NBA Defensive Center as well. Simply doing it for the sake of some variety and yet you somehow you're not getting such a simple concept even after I said it to you twice already."
Tbf Brook Lopez was a damn good Center for the better part of the 2010s.
"...so wait, why are you talking about the free throw line, I don't get it?  I'd appreciate it if you held my hand here, because I do not understand why you're even discussing it when the entire point of this exercise is defense only.  Also, leaving out a 3xDPOY, 5xAll Defense, 2xAll Star, 4xAll NBA,  in his prime for Brook fucking Lopez isn't ""just a little different"", it's a legitimately bad take that deserves criticism lmfao."
"Different person, but same comment.  &gt;none of these guys are liabilities from the line in close games besides Simmons so I don't have to take them out  Brook Lopez: Career 79% from the line . Over 80% with the Bucks specifically)  Rudy Gobert: Career 63% from the line. He's not a ""liability"" but a bit too low for what I wanted either and I simply wanted to be a little different than what others picked or else everyone would be saying the same answer and that's boring af.  I wouldn't call y'all crazy, but man some of you handle different opinions like fucking children."

Should be the best team in the NBA."
Zion and i think nop can trade him and build around Ingram.I love Zion and he's easily a top 3 exciting player to watch.But he's an undersized power forward without outside shooting.And he's too small to defend centers or protecting the rim.He needs a Brook Lopez-Myles Turner type center.
"Lopez is much more important to the Bucks success than Portis, IMO. Bucks could definitely repeat without portis if everyone else is healthy (especially donte). Don’t think the bucks can repeat without brook"
"As a matterafact we wouldn't be talking about KD's lack of awareness about his position around the three po..... I mean size of his shoe if it weren't for Brook Lopez also having a lapse in awareness a few seconds before, where he got the ball on an inbound with 2 seconds left and passed the ball. If he would have shot and even just hit the rim, the KD 2 pointer wouldn't have happened.  We can all talk about what ifs, but what happened happened, and the team that executed better won. The afact that he wore his big dumb shoes and stood too close to the 3 point line has just as much to do with the Nets losing as every other thing."
Can you bank on FAs? Where were those big FAs from the decade before Lebron? Brook Lopez?
"Definitely not. Not without either a super elite floorspacer or 2 or 3 great floor floorspacers.  Magic shot 38% on low volume, teams will leave him open like they did with Brook Lopez who initially shot 40% on 3s on low volume. Let him shoot and apck the rim to make it diffuclt for the rest of the team."
"LeBron is a 37% 3 point shooter on a high degree of difficulty   AD is a roughly 33-34% 3 point shooter, thats comparable to Brook Lopez   Kareem is a 0% 3 point shooter and Magic ranges in the 10-20% 3 point range. Thats just not comparable at all.   Jimmy shot 35% from 3 in that finals run"
" &gt; Why not trade your starting 5 and your 1st rounder for DLO? Lopez was an impending free agent, and they liked DLO more than Kuzma. This cleared cap space for a potential FA.  A lot of this wasn't about cap space for a potential FA.   The point was that Brook Lopez, at the time of the trade, was 28, and the Nets correctly realized that they were a couple of years away, and by the time the rest of the team was good he'd be in his declining years.  With Levert, they were giving up Thad Young, who, similarly, was in the second half of his 20s, and likely out of his prime by the time the Nets were competitive.   That's really different from what the Sixers were doing trading away *a 22-year-old all-star Jrue Holiday* for Nerlins Noel and (eventually) Efrid Payton. The Nets were acquiring guys who they thought could be 22-year-old all-stars (D'Lo), not trading them away for two mid-lottery picks.   That Jrue trade was a classic ""A draft pick could be anything! It could even be Jrue Holiday!"" move. When you're valuing asset accumulation is more important than 22-year-old all-stars, you're doing it wrong.   The ""multi-year intentional suck to get good"" has resulted in zero titles in the past 40 years. Yeah, teams have sucked. Yeah, teams have even tanked for a season. Instead, the ""get as good as you can while maintaining flexibility and looking for opportunities to add pieces"" has resulted in titles for the Bucks, Raptors, Warriors, Spurs, and Heat in the past decade.   (The one exception might be the Lakers. I'm open to the argument that the Lakers were stealth tanking by giving Kobe his final extension, they're also one team which is playing by fundamentally different rules than everybody else.)"
"2011 playoffs, I substitute Luka for Nowitzki:  Kyle Lowry (Kidd)  Derrick Jones Jr. (DeShawn Stevenson)  Luka  Luguentz Dort (Shawn Marion)  Brook Lopez (Tyson Chandler)  Bench:  Jordan Clarkson (Jason Terry)  Brunson (Barea)  Carmelo Anthony (Peja)  Willie Cauley-Stein (Brendan Haywood)  Minimum contract veterans for the spots of Cardinal, Mahinmi and Brewer."
"* Jon Horst became GM in June 2017. A better GM allows you to get better trades, better free agency signings (e.g. Brook Lopez), better players in the draft, a better coach (e.g. Bud over Kidd), etc. * Giannis improved a lot."
Prime Horford is better than Brook Lopez... So he'd fit great.
Brook Lopez
Brook lopez. Gave a stretch 5 that was needed badly or else giannis would struggle even more. Not sure why lakers lost lopez so easily. That 2017/18 season was brutal for lopez under walton
The got rid of the worst coach in the league and hired a top 5 coach.  They also signed Brook Lopez to near-min deal and he allowed Giannis to play more help defense compared to the aggressive defense of Kidd.
Internal improvement and Bud replacing Kidd.   Another huge addition was Brook Lopez. He has been so much better than any of the pre-Bud centers we had and a great fit with Giannis.
"Disagree on that. He can shoot, he has soft hands and post moves, and he's a solid passer. DAJ has one offensive skill - lob finishing. Ayton plays more like an athletic version of nets Brook Lopez than DAJ."
People might not like it but Rudy Gobert being pump faked on the perimeter by Brook Lopez while a guard commits a defensive 3 second violation is one of the greatest single possessions in NBA history.
"Acting like Jokic is unredeemable in the pick and roll is such a 2019 take. The honey paw will get ya with the swipe, his aggressive drop coverage is pretty solid all things considered. It's not close to being the biggest limitation in his defensive game regardless of what vibe you picked up from the Blazers and Suns series.   From a pure PPP perspective, he was in the same range last postseason as guys like Brook Lopez, Bam, and Valancunias who don't get nearly the same flack. And he did that while facing the 2nd and 4th best regular-season pick and roll teams."
"Depth can be gotten easily.  Guys like Jrue Holiday, Cameron Payne, Jae Crowder, Booby Portis, Brook Lopez who make the rest of the roster of championship level teams are traded, waived, or developed all the time.  Lakers won a championship with Caruso starting game 6, with guys like Rondo and Dwight Howard filling major roles on the team.    Philly should have said ""Take anything from our team except Embiid"" for Harden, and then built around those two."
"I mean, Brook Lopez does have an all defensive team under his belt. Miles better is an overstatement."
Marc was the best player/leader of a WCF team. Brook Lopez transformation from low post offensive center with shitty defense to 3 pt threat and very good defensive player is super impressive tho.
\&gt;Brook Lopez ambles into trailing 3s with the ease and familiarity of an old man plopping into a recliner  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt; Thanasis Antetokounmpo is a bumper car playing his own hybrid of rugby and basketball  &amp;#x200B;  lmao spot on
"Jesus christ do miami heat players go through a 6 week flopping course? they got this ""tough tenacious defender"" Bam Adebayo floppin all over the place so bad that Brook Lopez is imitating him?  This is the guy who just said their locker room is a kennel, is that a kennel for prize poodles that can lay down on command? Lol"
"Brook Lopez when he was on the Nets. Walking out of Target next to Barclay's Center. Said what's up, he gave me a silent nod.  Think he sensed that I am a Knicks fan."
Brook Lopez
&gt; worst pound for pound rebounder  brook lopez (whose game i love)
"Giannis isn’t a top 5 rebounder imo. He’s good but not top 5. Without Brook Lopez, he would probably get 2-3 fewer rebounds a game. He actually gets a lot of rebounds in a similar fashion as Westbrook, but he’s just more likeable and a better player overall so no one will call him out for that."
You must be talking of Brook Lopez
"All my theory’s are stupid as fuck but they make watching games I don’t care about more fun. Especially watching with friends. So here they are. -Robin Lopez never played for the bucks, it was Brook in a wig the whole time.   -Payton Pritchard actually wanted to be the leprechaun mascot for the Celtics but signed the wrong contract, and he’s Irish and is fueled by beer and potatoes. (I know these are dumb stereotypes but that’s what makes it funny)  -Aaron Nesmith is James Nesmiths son, frozen in time and given the instructions to the commissioner on when to be awakened. This means he’s Adams son as well  -lastly ( that I can think of right now) Brad Stevens is a mutant clone of Frank Vogel that was supposed to sabotage the Celtics but went rouge.  Btw I’m not really a Celtics fan I have no clue why I have so many theories about them. Anyways that’s my Ted talk, thanks for listening."
"Honestly for me it comes down to who else is a free agent, and who can be acquired in a trade. Both occupy a somewhat rarefied space right now; Ayton is a very good C and you need those to compete at a high level, Bridges is one of the best wing defenders in the league and shoots 3's at a high level.   If there's a C available in the Brook Lopez/Steven Adams/Nurkic range of ability that you're confident you can get then keep Mikal. If you can't get a decent replacement in, then Ayton has to stay."
Makes me miss the nerdy big man era so much more. Brook Lopez and Jarrett Allen would never put up with this jabroni.
"Trade him to Minnesota in a three team with the Bucks, bring back D'Lo and receive Brook Lopez as well. RUN IT BACK"
"I'm optimistic. Look at Lonzo Ball, the only guy who had worst mechanics was Michael Kidd Gilchrest, but Ball fixed his jumper. He's actually a decent/good shooter now. Brook Lopez went from sinking three 3pt shots in his first 8 years to sinking 134 in his 9th season.   So I think the only thing that's keeping anyone from being a good shooter is repetition and effort. We have some of the best shooting coaches and developmental staff in the league, so as long as he puts the time into it, then it'll happen I feel.   On the other hand, you can't teach defensive instincts. I can't think of too many bad or average defenders become good or lock down. Scottie's got the stuff you can't really teach or develop, every minus he has can be turned into a positive."
"I don’t think he’d be much better than Brook honestly. He’d be the fourth option, just like Brook. I mean look at when they made Lopez the focal point in the playoffs. It’s just not that important to the offense when Giannis is playing though. That’s why I’d rather the defense and rebounding."
I don’t think he’s a downgrade either. However he isn’t the type of center that should be paired with Zion. If he can somehow turn into a brook lopez type player then I’ll retract that statement.
"Maybe I'm reaching for pebbles here, but like, I think Brook Lopez is clearly better than Myles Turner. And why is Capela not on the list?"
"When you have your top 2 players who therefore will play the most minutes, it is an issue.   Having either one shoot 38% from 3 at at least 2 made per game would make us instant contenders.   Having Bam and Jimmy not shooting the 3 well does not make us a bad team because like you said. They are elite passers for their position but them not shooting the 3 well puts us at a ECF contender level. Not a NBA chip contender level if that makes sense. We are not on the same tier. We ain’t bad, we are good. Just not great and that’s what we want to be. Great.   The problem with our two stars not shooting the 3 well is that it handicaps the rest of the team. We usually have to pick our poison. Do we go with a shooter who gets hunted on D? Or someone who is big and can rebound/protect the paint but doesn’t spread the floor on O?   Ironically, we needed Jrue and Brook Lopez on our team last year. We would win the chip with those two on our team but that’s not how it works…"
Robin Lopez &gt; Brook Lopez
Turner is Simmons best fit center. Basically his Brook Lopez. I can see why Indiana might move Sabonis for another half court playmaker.
Brook Lopez &gt; Nikola Vucevic
"Bucks playing Brook Lopez, George Hill and the bottom five of the roster. Nets playing KD and Harden. You're monsters."
He only took 3.3 threes a game the Bucks just shot pretty bad all around. Jrue shot 30%. PJ shot 32%. Brook Lopez shot 32%. Khris Middleton shot 34.3%
"I see your argument, and raise you Brook Lopez and rebounding.  Yeah, *his* rebound numbers are awful. But mysteriously, the players around him get more than usual."
What if he has a Brook Lopez-esque renaissance and becomes a great 3 point shooter. He would definitely become more playable
We need Boban and Brook Lopez going at each other in the 3pt Contest @ All Star Weekend
"I'm with you on this one, and get shouted down by armchair head coaches every time I've even suggested it here.  It's since come out that PJ Tucker suggested the idea and the entire team agreed that it was that right choice.  I'm going to go ahead and say that an entire roster of NBA players is a better judge of the quality of a strategy than a bunch of kids on reddit who haven't even drawn up so much as an out-of-bounds play.  Doubling KD is a trap.  KD *want*s you to double team him.  I have yet to see *any* evidence that doubling KD has ever been an effective strategy.  He was luring the Celtics into sending double-teams the series before and absolutely torched them every time they tried it.  I'm 100% certain that if the Bucks double-teamed KD the series would have been over in 5-6 games with an easy win for the Nets.   Everyone seems to have this vague idea that a double team would have worked better, but I've never actually seen a reasonable plan for doubling him. Who are the Bucks going to throw into a double team against KD? He's spending most of his time in the halfcourt between the midrange and the perimeter, which means that sending Giannis is going to open up the paint.  And if Giannis gets into foul trouble the Bucks are absolutely fucked.  Brook Lopez is not fast enough to be a realistic defensive threat against KD.  Everyone else is so short that KD could still just as easily pivot, fadeaway and simply shoot over 2-3 defenders at once if he wants to."

"Brook Lopez was just like ""Yeah... Whatever"""
How many PG votes did Brook Lopez get?
Great recall. Pau made Kg look like brook lopez out there held him to 3 boards in a game 7
"Huh? He's 22    He averaged 16 PTS/12 REB in his first playoffs against Jokic, AD, and Brook Lopez on 65% shooting"
"&gt; Bobby Portis didn't have any impact on the series whatsoever  Bobby Portis rebounded and hit his open 3s, how is that not having an impact? Hitting your 3s is the best thing you can do on a Giannis led team.   &gt; Kyle Lowry is better than Jrue Holiday in every aspect (except defense and even then Kylr Lowry is not too far behind)  Lowry is a much weaker defender than Jrue. And Jrue on the Bucks moves the needle more than Lowry on the Heat because the Bucks are a more talented team with a generation talent on it. We only needed Jrue to be the 3rd/2nd guy on any given night to loosen up Giannis and Middleton. Lowry being better than Jrue on offense doesn't mean anything.   &gt;  Giannis only had one game where he scored at least 30 points.  Yeah because y'all quadruple teamed him and he passed it out to our shooters. That's why the series was one sided. You couldn't counter attack once we actually hit our 3s and you rolled over. Giannis didn't have to score.   &gt; Brook Lopez did was camp under the rim when Bam was scared to shoot, but I expect Bam to take those shots this time around and pull Lopez out of the paint. Bam has the speed advantage then.  So Bam will suddenly outplay Lopez because *you* expect him to in your homer mind? No facts behind it, just because *you* a redditor ""expects it"". Okay.   &gt; Grayson Allen is not going to be the difference maker in a two peat.  So Bryn Forbes being gone is a loss for us and a factor. But his much better replacement (who could even start over Donte) is a non factor? Tell me how that makes sense."
"Bobby Portis didn't have any impact on the series whatsoever. Kyle Lowry is better than Jrue Holiday in every aspect (except defense and even then Kylr Lowry is not too far behind), so I expect him to have the same impact Jrue had for the Bucks. Giannis only had one game where he scored at least 30 points. All Brook Lopez did was camp under the rim when Bam was scared to shoot, but I expect Bam to take those shots this time around and pull Lopez out of the paint. Bam has the speed advantage then. Khris Middleton did have good series. Grayson Allen is not going to be the difference maker in a two peat."
"Myles Turner, AD, KAT, Embiid, Porzingis, Jokic, Brook Lopez, Capela. Just off the top of my head those guys would all be better fits if we’re talking 5s in the whole league"
"Simmons is really just....deluded.   Embiid is basically a perfect center for him. On defense Embiid allows Simmons to play super tight one on one defense because anyone that gets by will have to deal with Embiid at the rim.   On offense Embiid stretches the floor and can catch lobs and cut to the rim.   None of the elite offensive centers (KAT, Jokic, Vucevic) can tough Embiid defensively. And none of the elite defensive centers are nearly as versatile on offense. The only other center who is comparable to Embiid's two way skillset  is Brook Lopez, and Brook isn't even close to Joel's level"
"It's not a wild stat. Its just a matter of cherry picking the right low pick with the right high pick in the right time frame to get something people think is wild.  For instance if we go back more years, then the 10th pick would include Paul George, Brook Lopez, Joe Johnson, and Paul Pierce. And suddenly looks a lot better than the 27th picks"
Pretty sure Brook and Robin Lopez are in a similar situation.
That's what happens when you aren't forced to play him single coverage because he's playing with multiple MVP/all-nba guards. His greatest flaw has always been his inability to be the primary initiator of a great offense. He isn't a great playmaker under pressure and he has a weak handle so teams would typically send doubles and crowd his high dribble to force him into tough shots and turnovers. Nowadays he looks like a god because he can just play single coverage all day and just shoot over his matchup.   I was excited to see the Bucks exploit this but they refused to double him and had Brook Lopez playing fucking drop coverage in PnR. A lot of stupid ball was played on both sides that series
"Yeah, and Yao was an incredible shooter for someone of his size. I could easily see him being a Brook Lopez type player in today's NBA."
Pretty sure its brook lopez
Lol was so frustrating watching Brook Lopez sag off him. Did not trust his jumper at all even though he would take those shots in the reg season
"I think the problem is the Center of whatever team he goes to. I agree CJ for Ben (plus whatever pieces) makes sense in a vacuum, but Nurk is one of the worst centers for Ben, but Nurk &amp; Dame have am incredible relationship.   The centers I think could work with Simmons are all spacers:  KAT (fits with everyone)   Myles Turner  Brook Lopez (the giannis fit works incredibly well for a reason)   Vucevic   Porzingis (assuming health)   Jokic   Collins (if you play him at center)   And that's about it..."
Simmons needs a team built around him like Lebron or Giannis. A bunch of shooters with a guy who can go get his own bucket.     Brook Lopez standing at the 3 pt line is a better fit than Jojo on the block.
" Disagree with this line:  &gt; If Brook Lopez hadn't turned into Hakeem Olajuwon in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals, we might be talking about the defending NBA champion Atlanta Hawks.  Because true fans know that Brook Lopez *is* Hakeem Olajuwon who instead chooses to spot up behind the three point line."
Kevin Durant  Luka Doncic  Rudy Gobert  Robert Covington  Brook Lopez  i.e. Luka with a 7-footer who can actually shoot
"Over the next *five* years? **Luka, Lonzo, Mikal, Giannis, Turner.** The Luka-Giannis pairing is obvious if we're looking to the future, and then you're just surrounding those guy with shooters and defenders who are young enough that they're unlikely to decline in that five-year window. I'm lower on Myles Turner than I feel like a lot of folks are, like I don't think teams really respect his outside shot like that, but his defensive impact absolutely is there, and I think he'd be great in the Brook Lopez role next to Giannis— this is only a starting lineup, hopefully you'd also have a solid 3/4 sixth man who can let Giannis slide down to center against smaller teams."
Shoutout to 28 other teams for being idiots and letting Brook Lopez take a minimum lmao
brook lopez was for sure bringing the yu-gi-oh cards
Recently I was frustrated and disappointed when the Lakers didn't re-sign Brook Lopez who would've been a perfect fit on the 18-19 team.   Before that it was frustrating to lose the '04 Championship. That stung quite a bit.
A realistic team base off salary cap.   Ben   Seth curry   Harrison Barnes / miles bridges   Kristaps/   Kat/ brook Lopez
Watch brook lopez shooting 3s
Deron williams and cp3 were in a battle over who was the best young pg in the league. They also had joe johnson. I dont think anyone thought old pierce and kg were going to carry that nets team but the thought was that they would be good enough to compliment the rest of their starting lineup who were all young allstars or players with allstar potential. This trade wouldnt have been bad at all for nets if deron williams didnt get hurt and fall off a cliff. Brook lopez also got hurt a bunch during that time (which kinda wild because I can’t remember him having a serious injury after leaving the nets). They made the playoffs the first year despite injuries but it just went down hill from there. If dwill and brook were healthy all of those picks would have been in the 20s and the trade would’ve looked a lot different.
"Joel is right and we are obviously gonna side with him because he’s talking, but come on cuh. Shooting threes does not make one a floor spacer, people have to respect your shot. To maximize Ben Simmons, Joel needs to become Brook Lopez and that’s obviously a waste of his talent. This needed to happen for both players, just a regrettable way to go about it"
Not block or steals! All these team metrics don’t tell the story.   Brook Lopez had the second most blocks in the league that year (AD 3rd). Giannis had an elite rim protecter behind him for most of his minutes.
2018-19 Brook Lopez. Absolute magical season never seen anyone that big bombing 30fters and locking down the paint.
More like a better Myles Turner or better Bucks Brook Lopez. KP had/has a lot more perimeter game that no-one ever really expected Bamba to develop.
"Does Embiid count? If not Brook Lopez, Al Horford, or Marc Gasol, if I understand your definition of stretch 5 properly"
Brook lopez
Brook lopez 😏
"OP said stretch 5 but pretty clearly is asking who has the most range as a center. Porziņģis actually has a pretty good argument for longest range for a center.   Out of centers who took 28+ feet 3PTA in 2019-20, KP ranked first by far hitting nearly 38% of his deep deep 3s (33/88), Nemanja Bjelica shot 34% and Brook Lopez shot 25% both on less attempts. Porziņģis actually had the 2nd highest deep 3% out of any player with 75+ attempts, first was Dāvis Bertāns with 34/78 (44%)"
Full season: Robin Lopez   Post season: Brook Lopez
think Brook Lopez or Serge Ibaka.
"There are at least decent starting level players with picks offered for Ben Simmons right now. The Sixers at minimum could at least upgrade their depth and have additional picks to work a subsequent trade later.   The latest stories about how Ben wants a team built around him like Giannis to help his trade value are complete fantasy and no team actually believes it. You absolutely cannot scale Ben Simmons' offense like you can a player like Giannis. Ben is also no where near as good of a shooter as Giannis. Claiming Giannis is in the same category of ""non-shooters"" like Ben is terrible. Giannis can drive, get fouled, and shoot free throws. For his career Giannis makes about 20% more free throws both regular and post season than Ben. Giannis also has the rim protection that allows him to have shooters around him. Yes the the Bucks have Brook Lopez, but Brook Lopez wasn't in there for much of the 4th quarters in the last playoffs. You still have to have a good rim protector with Ben out there in the 4th or players will have free reign to just drive to the basket."
I'm a big fan of the one about if Robin and Brook Lopez were combined into one mega twin
"Give me Pat Bev, PJ tucker, Bobby Portis, Brook Lopez, and Seth curry."
PJ Tucker. Pat Connaughton. Brook Lopez.
Wasn't that Brook Lopez to his brother Robin?
definitely missing brook lopez with how many offensive rebounds theyve been giving up
This Bucks team is unfortunately missing a few players who impact rebounding a lot. So far they've been 18th in defensive rebounds. I want Brook Lopez back.
Damn that's crazy too bad he lost to Brook Lopez on his home court
"Jeremy Lin doesn’t get enough credit for that change. If he never got injured, he’d be getting tons of credit for the culture change in Brooklyn alongside Brook Lopez"
"I was just surprised as a newer NBA fan, to see the gigantic brook lopez draining 3s without fail, when he didnt really make too many in games"
Tbf Brook Lopez is money
"Tbh Brook Lopez was stretch big, albeit not too efficient he's better shooter than most NBA C. A much better example would be to see Rudy Gobert vs Wembanyama 1on1, where Rudy just easily drains 3 after 3. Rudy is not even a midrange threat in the NBA"
"I actually  believed this one, as i wasnt reslly an NBA fan and then i went to a bucks playoff game last year  and i watched brook lopez drain like 7 3s in a row while warming up, and i was amazed!"
"My money is on Giannis, Bobby Crazy Eyes and Grayson “sweep the leg” Allen. Brook Lopez looks crazy enough to do some damage too."
"It’s nothing new either. Regardless of who’s calling the shots you guys have beeeen doing this. Brook Lopez, Zubac, Caruso etc etc"
"I think Yao would translate, its not like every center in the nba is fast. Yao actually had super soft touch and was a good ft shooter (83%) career. From all accounts he wasnt a bad passer either although his numbers never showed it. I truly believe based on his touch and ft percentage he would be able to stretch the floor with the best of the big men. His floor would be something like brook lopez and his ceiling would of been KAT or a less playmaking jokic. At his peak he was averaging 25 with a 60 TS shooting zero threes. Todays spacing would give him more room to operate in the post and the mid range where he was already effective in his hayday"
"You could say Brook Lopez was vital for the play-offs, but he underperformed when playing the suns, when looking at shooting splits (48%, 23%, 80%.) And rebounds (5.3).  Gobert defensively is on a whole nother level."
"No Giannis, Khris or Brook Lopez. Celtics you should win this easy, just have fun and pass the ball around - no pressure, just see what happens! No tricks!"
"If Giannis is in the perimeter then he is not near the rim and our rim protection takes a huge hit or is non existent with Brook Lopez out. That's why he always act as a free safety, staying near the paint ready to help anyone who gets beat.   This way we can live with a guy scoring 30-40 efficient points but everyone else struggling to score a bucket."
"First of all, AD and LBJ are just a better version of this set up.  Harden and KD, Giannis and Brook Lopez also beat them"
Giannis and Anthony Davis aren't centers so they aren't on that part of this list. Also you got to be smoking crack if you think Brook Lopez is on Aytons level at this point in his career.    This isn't some crack pot idea. Look at any top 10 center list Ayton is either 6 or 7.
"Good idea, like maybe a Miles Turner or Brook Lopez?"
Giannis at the 5 certainly is. I'd also argue Brook Lopez is at least as valuable on offense and defense than Ayton.
Brook Lopez and giannis aren’t exactly the twin tower template lol
"they need to draft better and pick up value among free agents. Milwaukee gets a lot of props for Giannis and Middleton. I would say the Timberwolves are not significantly worse than that first year of Middleton/Giannis. The problem is that it is easy to say ""sign the next Brook Lopez and Bobby Portis, draft the next DiVincenzo and Connaughton, trade and long term sign for the next Jrue holiday "" but it is quite difficult to do.  &amp;#x200B;  If I were them I would target Christian Wood as he only has next year on his deal, see what it would take to get Jerami Grant on the team, see what you could get for Rubio. They really need to hit at least two home run signings.  &amp;#x200B;  If they do trade KAT they need to get a mountain of picks back and hit on almost every one of them"
Brook Lopez two years in a row
If you count aba then dr j. Otherwise Vince carter was all nba player for us. Deron Williams and joe Johnson had a few all stat years. Brook Lopez had an all star year.
1. Jason Kidd 2. Dr J 3. Brook Lopez 4. I  5. Cant 6. Fucking 7. Name 8. Anyone 9. Else 10. Lol
Plus their username is Brook Lopez related...I support OP moreso now.
im a brook lopez fan. thats why i like the nets and the bucks when he plays
Brook Lopez almost a decade when he was on the Nets
"Brook Lopez is an incredible deal, and is taking that pay cut to be on a contender. If you don't think he's good, then you don't watch enough pacers basketball. I don't blame you, unless you're a fan there's really no reason to."
"I feel like a casual is a better description for a guy who looks at 2 box score stats to decide that Myles is an elite player instead of realizing that a center that can’t post up, screen, dribble, or pass isn’t that useful.   Pacers fans always compare him to draymond in impact when he’s really closer to like brook Lopez."
Brook Lopez is a comparable player who gets paid half as much.   No GM in the league wants to be handing Myles Turner the bag. Pacers are always trying to trade him because he just isn’t that good.
Brook Lopez is the best defensive player on the Bucks
"Could make a pretty great team from the inactive list for this game  MIL: Donte DiVincenzo, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Sandro Mamukelashvili  PHI: Grant Riller, Isaiah Joe, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid, Matisse Thybulle, Ben Simmons"
"Oh look, you dIdN'T AnSwEr mY qUeStiOn EiThEr....  If you actually watched them last playoffs, I doubt you did with the stupid shit you are saying, they did figure it out. Coach bud did make more adjustments vs years prior. For example, Bobby Portis barely played in the Nets series because he struggled on the switch but played a significant more time against the Hawks and Suns. When Brook Lopez struggled on the switch against the Hawks, coach bud made adjustments and so did Brook when he did play. Bucks were down at some point in almost every series and made adjustments and came back and won. They dominated the heat, swept them in 4 games, revenge series for what happened the year before.   When Giannis' knee bent backwards, Coach bud and the rest of the team made the adjustments and stepped up, beating the Hawks in 6.   During the Suns series, Giannis was literally playing on one leg, team stepped up, he stepped up and also started making his free throws. Everything clicked for Giannis in that game 6 against the suns where he DROPPED 50 POINTS in an NBA FINALS game. GTFOH."
"You could've anwsered that yourself if you actually watched the playoffs. Its clearly Bud figured something out because we started with Giannis ISOs on the left block during the Nets series, they had no answer for that. Lopez also started cutting more, especially on drives by Jrue. In the Hawks series he adapted by forcefeeding Brook and Bobby after Giannis went down. They adapted their defense too going from drop coverage vs the Heat vs Brook/Giannis/Bobby essentially switching on high PnR vs the Nets but especially the Hawks and Suns.    Anyway, you're the classic example of a /r/nba nephew who talks out of his ass and then goes ""bruh tell me how they did it then"". Next playoffs try and actually watch the games before saying dumb shit in a discussion forum."
"And Brook Lopez, a stretch big that should’ve been perfect next to lebron. Maybe someone else will pick him up and he’ll get a ring somewhere."
Lol. Let me tell you some facts right now.    Joel Ebmiid: NBA player    Brook Lopez: NBA player
Players like Brook Lopez and Middleton took over games with Giannis out. Bucks got stretches of All-NBA like play from both at times
"no shame, that’s a Tatum line😮‍💨 and then he’ll score 40 a week later  If he got it by trying and failing to go at Brook Lopez over and over? That’s a certified, 100% Tatum classic"
Gg and all but donte divencenzo and brook lopez can’t really be compared with Joel embiid and Tobias Harris
"I never said equally short handed, but don’t act like khris Middleton and brook Lopez don’t make any difference"
Brook Lopez hasn't played since the first game. Donte hasn't played since the playoffs
"No. Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, and Donte. All on the roster still....."
LETS GET BROOK LOPEZ BACK
Bucks lose: They needed Brook Lopez  Bucks win: They didn't need Brook Lopez
brook lopez baby! he's not playing.
"Dude lol...  * Middleton, the second leading scorer on the team has been out the last 5 games due to covid.   * Brook Lopez, the Bucks starting center, has only played 1 game due to back issues and the Bucks don't have a backup center.  * Jrue Holiday, the third or second best player on the team (depending on who you talk to) has only played 4 games so far due to an injury he suffered in the first game of the season.   * Bobby Portis is bouncing back from an injury as well.   Why make a post about something you clearly know nothing about and just trying to be a hater. 5 seconds of googling would have told you all this."
Brook Lopez
"Brook Lopez has back issue , Middleton COVID , Jrue was the one with a non COVID illness but yeah overall this season a lot players have been sick for different reasons"
"Shooters, shooters, shooters. If a team could have a starting 5 similar to one with Giannis in mind, that would play to Westbrooks strengths tremendously. Instead of Giannis being the primary ball handler you have Russ, so you would want a starting 4 that can shoot 3s. Westbrook, Klay, Middleton, PJ, and Brook Lopez is a lineup off the top of my head that would have the 'spacing' on offense that Westbrook would thrive in. Not an easy player to build around, but we saw a glimpse of Westbrooks full potential in the few months he was healthy in Houstons small ball lineup."
"Jokic is bigger than KAT. Height-wise they’re similar but Jokic weighs more. I would say Jokic, Brook Lopez, and Embiid are the 3 biggest dudes in the league when it comes to a combo of height and size."
Brook Lopez too.
I was calling for them to start Maxey last year when it was clear Simmons was useless on offense against the Hawks. He is legit and is likely to get better not worse.  A 5 out offense doesn’t mean everyone scores from the perimeter. It is just how you start your set. It gives Giannis the most room to drive. If someone helps then you have 4 capable shooters to kick too. That is why Brook Lopez is so valuable for them.   The Sixers tried the same thing with Simmons and had Embiid in the Lopez role often last year. The problem with Ben is he can score on guys that are 6-3 like Beal and Westbrook but not on actual good defenders.   This is why he was going into the paint just to kick it out constantly last year. Add that to the fact he can only finish right handed outside of dunks and is scared to shoot foul shots.   I understand why you want to believe Simmons is a good player in half court offense but he just isn’t. Not on a team with Embiid.   Maybe if he gets his own team surrounded by shooters he could do alright but I can guarantee that team won’t win in the playoffs playing that style unless Simmons fixes his glaring weaknesses.
"Hmm I didn't know about the brook Lopez incident too, if he did do it twice that changes my mind a bit"
"Olynyk tore k loves shoulder out in the playoffs, and nearly did the same thing to brook lopez. Those things stick out in the mind more than shit like this even if the stuff like this is constant"
Brook Lopez
"Lol, first time watching Bud? Bud always experiments with lineups and now honestly it's really the best time. Jrue's just got back, Khris is out, Brook is out, Allen is sick, Portis on minutes watch... the main starters outside of Lopez haven't even played much together this year at all."
"Yes two of their starters. Lopez their Center who is their best Rim protector and a great defender and Middleton their second leading scorer. They are missing some core pieces.  Oh and as you know...teams play better when they are facing the reigning champion because they have more motivation.  So it’s several factors that are contributing to their slower start. Injury recovery and because Giannis/Bucks just have a target on their back. Along with Bucks having a depleted bench. Also their current lineup isn’t firing on all cylinders. The best lineup is Giannis,Holiday,Middleton,Brook and then a defender or another shooter.   Right now...teams are just taking advantage of a depleted champion off to a slow start. I suspect Bucks will pull back into the 6 at the lowest by around Christmas time."
In their prime?  Mo Williams  Kyle Korver  Wesley Matthews  Pau Gasol  Brook Lopez  With Portis off the bench  I got Bucks
Nah it's brook lopez
"There’s some context missing here. KP is at 36% for his career, but he’s also taking 5 a game. The previous two seasons he’s shot 6 and 7. That’s really high volume for a center. You have to guard him out there because he hits enough of them and you know he’s willing to take the shot. With some other centers who can shoot, someone like a Marc Gasol, you know he doesn’t want to shoot so there’s more willingness to help off. That’s a guy you can’t leave vs a release valve.  You can make 36% seem like nothing, but factoring in position and volume, it’s pretty solid. We can also throw in his worst year was his rookie year and he’s got an ACL tear return season in there as well. He shot 39% prior to the tear and 37% the season after returning which is when you’re supposed to be back to normal. You can’t dismiss his contributions to this offense that’s been one of the best in the league until this year. They’re not the same offense without that 5 out spacing.   I’m not too sure about stuff like Drummond not getting bullied on other end. He was getting bullied by his current teammate before joining the team. Let’s say that’s Embiid and he bullies a lot of guys. Well, he also got bullied by Ayton in the playoffs last year. He stood no chance against the Suns guards in PnR either. It was so bad he was benched for the deciding game and, I’m speculating a little here, but I’m doubtful his coach had wanted him starting the previous games either. He was starting for so long because of some front office mandate.  Drummond is also pretty limited offensively. Center is more of a defensive position, but the difference in value here is huge. He’s really not a meaningful pick and roll threat. Again with that Lakers series last year we saw Drummond, with AD either spacing or out of the lineup, unable to work with Lebron in a pick and roll attack. He’s not currently a lob guy, he’s not getting on top of the rim before the defense can react and he’s obviously not a great finisher which is part of why his offensive rebounding numbers look so good.   We also know Drummond’s rebounding value is overstated by the basic numbers. He juices his own numbers, but his teams have often not rebounded so much better with him on the floor the way you we’ve seen with guys like Brook Lopez."
Brook Lopez
"Guard 80/20 : we've seen a lot of guards on elite teams being bad or below average while their team was still an elite defense, most elite defensive wings can guard guards, and most guards can be hidden on defense because most of them at least have size. On the other end we've seen plenty of elite defensive guards on crappy defensive teams.  Wings 55/45 : I'll say that bad wing defense is worse than bad wing offense, but an elite offensive wing is THE key to the current era IMO, can't win without one  Center 20/80 : Brook Lopez/Giannis, AD, Marc Gasol, Draymond/Bogut, Tristan Thompson, Duncan, Bosh, Chandler, Pau/Bynum, here's the list of centers that have closed games for the NBA champions in the last 10/15 years, no defensive liabilities and basically all have case for all defense/DPOY at some point of their careers. Can't win with a defensive liability at center"
Brook lopez
Brook Lopez   Or James Harden
"Tatum had one of his premier games against the Bucks last year, but I definitely also remember one where he had like 11 misses in the paint while trying to go at Brook Lopez."
We realized the three wasn't falling and the Bucks had no Brook Lopez
I've seen enough Brook Lopez was robbed of 3 mvps
"Forget KD going to the Warriors, LeBron going back to Cleveland, Milwaukee reborn; the _real_ shocker to anyone from 2012 to now is that Brook Lopez is a defensive stallwort with a 3pt shot"
This is why brook lopez is so important to this team
Need brook lopez bad
And Brook Lopez is your defensive anchor. 38 points given up in the paint against the Knocks and you're not even thru 3Qs is wild
"\#10 is Brook Lopez. Better example.  In his first two seasons in the league, he played all 82 games each year. 4 three point attempts.  In his latest season in the league, he has played 1 game. 4 three point attempts."
"It comes entirely due to what else is happening in the league man. Some players almost come out the gates who they are (Duncan, AI) and some players have a crazy development arc (Brook Lopez, Ben Wallace). At this level all these players are roughly the same in terms of being incredible, and I think it’s a fools errand to try predict anything about this soap opera"
"This just reminded of how letting Brook Lopez walk was dumb. Lebron and AD weren't there yet, but he would've been a good fit with them and Russ."
"Westbrook doesn't box out, he expects everyone else to box out so he can get the rebound.  But Dwight, DeAndre and AD have each spent their entire careers being the primary rebounder for their team. They aren't suddenly going to just turn into Steven Adams or Brook Lopez when it comes to boxing out instead of chasing the ball, you can't break years of habit that easily."
Brook Lopez is number 10 and he has only been on the team for like barely 4 years lol
"If he has a center that can stretch the floor and also anchor defense like my homie Brook the dpoy Lopez, Power forward.  &amp;#x200B;  If not, Center"
"The roster reminds me of the 03-04 Lakers. All the talk in the offseason was about how Karl Malone and Gary Payton would make that team unstoppable.  Or the 13-14 Nets with Joe Johnson, KG, Paul Pierce, Jason Terry, Deron Williams, and Brook Lopez--another team that was hyped up in the offseason."
"The lakers have had one consistent problem since trading for LeBron. Poor shooting. They got lucky in the bubble with KCP being unsustainably hot at the right time, and other than that have struggled to shoot well.   Regardless of whether or not Buddy Hield shoots his usual percent with the Lakers, he is a massive upgrade over who they have now.   Also let me remind you, the lakers passed on Bojan to try and make a run for Kawhi even though he obviously didn't want to go, and instead overpaid for a year of Danny green. They also let Brook Lopez walk for nothing, and he just played a big role on a championship team.They are not making good moves in the slightest, and I dont get how Pelinka still has a job."
"&gt; No, man. You just brush off all of the issues Jamal had as a player. He couldn't string together 3 games of solid play, idgaf who was scouting him or what he was doing behind the scenes. His inconsistency went way beyond the domain of just being a young player.  It was not beyond the domain or just being a young player. Since box scores are the only thing that is connecting with you then here:  In his 2nd year and 1st as a starter, the 20 year old Jamal Murray had 27 games of 20 or more, including 7 over 30 5 of those over 58%, 3 over 60%, 2 over 70%. Of all the games he had under 10 points the majority of them were in wins. He had more games over 16 points than under 16 point.  In his 3rd year he had 29 games of over 20 or more, including 7 over 30 and 2 over 40 (48 and 46) which were both over 60% from the floor and misses 7 1/2 games to injury. OBPM goes up, BPM goes up just like it did the year before. TRB% goes up, AST% goes up, TOV% goes down while USG% goes up.  As a 21 year old, and I cannot stress this enough a 21 year old in his first playoffs he averages 21/4/5/1. Massively weight down by one very poor game. He has more games over 23 points than under and has two 34 point games to boot. Is also a + in two of the Nuggets losses and has the highest TS% among all non-bigs on the Nuggets, and a higher TS% than CJ and Dame.  His efficiency scoring went down in the regular season a bit but he was also given much more responsibility and allowed to take more shots. Generally speaking the efficiency goes down when that happens until a player is able to get used to it. If they are able to. Obviously they felt strongly that he would.  He did this on a playoff team that was winning games. A successful team. One where he wasn't the main option every night or could decide his fate all the time. That means it wasn't the situation where a player is putting up empty stats on a bad team (Sexton) and on paper looks much better than they are. Inconsistency aside he was playing winning basketball, had winning effort, and on top of that had made it clear that if he has a bad game in the first 3 quarters he comes out in the 4th ready to kill. He proved this many, many times.  That is a 100% of the time maxed player by the team they are playing for. A super young guy who can struggle for an entire game but then tap in and become a closer in the 4th, and seeks that, is significantly more intriguing and interesting for teams than someone who comes out and gives you 14-18 a night reliably in the system--i.e. Mikal Bridges. There is no question that Jamal had consistency issues, he would go for 20+ 4 games in a row and then come out with a 14 pointer and a 15 pointer the next two. But what he wasn't was mentally inconsistent. He was checked in and wanted the moments, even if he was missing shots. This wasn't a situation where he was fading away or getting in his head and avoiding the  responsibility. That is massive and overweighs a 15-25 point rollercoaster ride given his age.  Before he turned 22 years old Murray had shown improvement every single year. Clear, visual, in game, improvement. Added and refined skills. Was becoming extremely good in the PnR with Jokic, so much so that even at that age with this up and coming team he and Jokic LEAD THE LEAGUE IN ASSISTS BETWEEN TWO TEAMMATES and were considered a deadly late game system by themselves. He showed it in the regular season and showed it as the #2 guy in his first playoffs, again, as a 21 year old.   Sexton is 23 years old right now, has been putting up empty stats on a perennially bad team as -the- guy with the system built to help him succeed, and taking pretty much as many shots as he wants. Shoot Murray even if his scoring was off could turn into the offensive facilitator and would actively go for rebounds. He more than doubles Sexton in each category by the time he turned 21. He also proved he knew how to play off ball as a cutter or shooter, and was very good at keeping the ball secure and not having turnovers or getting into situations that could force a turnover. These are extremely valuable things that aren't going to show up on the box score. That is extremely uncommon maturity and poise for a 21 year old.  His weaknesses were inconsistency with scoring (as a 19, 20, 21 year old on a competitive team I will provide you with countless examples of inconsistency at that age including players like Carmelo and LeBron) and defense. Unless you come into the league as a defensive player, and a very good one like Davion Mitchell or GP2, NBA defense takes a while to get used to and learn. Not just whatever scheme you're playing as a team that you have likely never played in, but the size and speed of grown ass men with years of NBA training and the significantly heightened skill level of scorers. People doing things you've never had to guard before. Every young player gets slack on learning defense when they come in, because 99% of them need 2-3+ years to become a tolerable defender for a playoff caliber team. If not more.   Seriously. You have a 21 year old who has proven to you he can string together 20 point games since he was 19. He can have back to back 30 point game sin the playoffs. He has a fantastic mechanics/footwork for someone his age, and a shot form that will translate to better and better shooting as he himself gets better. He's already adept at being the main ball handler, an extraordinarily good PnR guard who can score from all 3 levels out of it (there are some all-stars who struggle with this in their late 20s!), can confidently play off ball as a spot up shooter or slasher and make the right offensive reads to facilitate success (being a good look), who is an extremely hard worker, improves his level of play in bigger or higher leverage situations, and does not shy away from it.   All of that is far, far, far, far greater than the negatives of inconsistent shooting and poor defense. Those are the reasons that Tim Connelly and Coach Malone never once considered trading him, said he was off limits since year 2, believed in him and gave him more and more responsibility despite having a budding superstar in Jokic who could be option 1 and 2, constantly and publicly praised him while also treating him with the responsibility level of a vet after year 2, and signed him to that max extension.   As any single team with a brain would have done. It is an absolute no doubt decision for all 30 teams. He is a special player and it was clear to see what was in there half way through year 2.   &gt; Was the Sixers front office full of donkeys when they gave Simmons the max?  By the time Philly signed Ben Simmons to his max he had been the Rookie of the Year, an All-Star twice, All-NBA 3rd team, All-Defensive 1st team, lead the league in steals, was a pivotal member of a team 1 game away from the finals, and was cruising to 16/8/8/2 a night on high 50s from the floor. He had all the tools and wherewithal to be an incredible slashing threat too if Philly had a better passer. There is no team at any point in the history of basketball who wouldn't have maxed him. His issue is entirely mental, and sad, and there was no predicting that.  &gt;  Was the Knicks front office full of redditors when they gave Porzingis the max?  Are we talking about the Kristaps who put up 23/7 with 2.5 blocks a night while being 7'3"" and shooting 40% from 3 and made the All-Star game? The guy who had made a massive jump each year in the league and was playing incredible before completely blowing apart his leg? If you're asking me if it was unwise for a team to max a 22 year old 7'3"" unicorn who could fly for huge dunks, shoot 3s better than many guards, and protect the paint and rim at an elite level I'd ask if you're joking. That's a no brainer. Now the issue if there was one is that it is a direct gamble to give a contract to any big man coming off an injury like that. Especially one as athleticism reliant as Porzingis. Regardless all 30 teams if they are in that position are giving him the max, you have to assume he comes back near that and if that's as good as he gets  for his career he's a better Brook Lopez and gets maxed into his 30s.  &gt; They were better players than Jamal as well.  Which is why they were no doubt decisions. Zero doubt. Zero hesitation. Zero questioning of the decision from those teams. Then both of those contracts presently look iffy because of completely uncontrollable circumstances. You can't guess if a player explodes his leg, and you can't guess if a player runs into one of the worst mental blocks in the history of the sport out of nowhere. That has zero to do with the front office's decision making.  &gt;  For every player who pans out and ends up being worth it there's a player that ends up overpaid.   Here are the players on a rookie max currently: Ben Simmons, SGA, Trae, MPJ, Fox, Mitchell, Bam, Tatum, KAT, Booker, Murray, Wiggins, Embiid, Siakam. The only questionable signing in this whole bunch is Siakam. When Wiggins was maxed that was as much Minnesota not being able to afford any semblance of a good player leaving them. Otherwise which of these players do you think isn't gonna be worth the contract? You implied 50% of them and considering all of them except for 8 games of MPJ and Siakam have been worth it, who is going to have a massive regression out of nowhere?  &gt;  Waiting a year doesn't cost them, simply.   Yes it does. This isn't 2K. The human element plays a massive part in this. Waiting a year tells a player ""eh, we dunno if we believe in you yet. let's see another year"", while all of their peers in the same situation are getting maxed. It also opens up really dumb FA possibilities which teams do not want to deal with even removing the fact they are burning part of the bridge with what could be a cornerstone player + their team."
Anyone who thinks centers don't matter today should have a think about what the Bucks without Brook Lopez look like.
"He's not seen as a stretch big, stretch big's are Brook lopez, KAT (the elites), and then you have guys like myles turner, etc. AD isn't seen as a stretch big, but more s as a big who CAN shoot (unlike the bigs who can only layup and dunk), but not a particularly efficient/great shooter"
Remember when the Lakers just gave Brook Lopez away because they thought he was washed up?
"He was a beast in the playoffs, just had bad luck with injuries.  Throw any traditional big man at him, and he would just absolutely eat those guys up. Boogie, Whiteside and Drummond got punk'ed by Jonas so many times.  The only bigs he could never really figure out were the Gasols and Brook Lopez, they had his number."
"I mean pretty much every example here you can point to roster changes which had their fair share of impact.  Bucks- Obviously Bud was the biggest upgrade but the team he had was definitely upgraded from what Kidd had. They got Brook Lopez for real cheap that offseason, they added Connaughton+Ilyasova (not world beaters but solid guys who contributed), and upgraded Delly to George Hill during the season.  Raptors- Casey to Nurse was definitely an upgrade but the team also got Kawhi+Gasol.  Warriors- Jackson to Kerr was huge but the team added Livingston and Barbosa that same offseason (again, not world beaters but solid contributors who gave them elite depth)  Rockets (McHale to D'Antoni)- Upgrade at coaching but the team also added pieces like Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson (who were actually starting level contributors at least that first season), and eventually CP3 (when they had their 65 win season).  I know there are levels to this and Livingston+Barbosa are obviously not the same as adding CP3 but I think overall, you could make that argument with pretty much every coaching change."
Lebron played more games than Giannis that year and had the top seed in the harder conference. The pandemic starting at the exact time of Giannis' injury and the Bucks weird sudden drama (Bud was benching Khris Middleton and Brook Lopez) while being on a losing streak completely screwed Lebron out of MVP and secured it for Giannis.
Giannis is the ultimate definition of hard worker. Only pairing him with coqch Bud and Brook Lopez could slow him down to become the GOAT at this point.
"i like ""splash mountain"" for brook lopez"
Giannis Antetokounmpo  Thanasis Antetokounmpo  Jrue Holiday  Brook Lopez   just won the championship this year.  Id have to imagine adding one of the greatest players of all time in Steph Curry wouldnt hurt
Brook lopez has been out since season start. So yeah. Tall people jumping around tightness
"You are heavily underestimating NBA players. What you see in a game is not what you see during practice/casual. You would never see Ben Simmons even attempt a 3 in a game, but you always see him ""in the lab"" and casually attempting and even consistently making 3s in pickup games.  [Here is Drummond shooting 3s at a Pro-Am game](https://youtu.be/nG3YFUG2DQA) and [here he is going about 8/12 during practice](https://youtu.be/B45gixnxnaU).  You're probably right that he doesn't practice it every day, but he obviously can and does practice it, as does every NBA player. Especially in the modern positionless NBA, that's why you always see big men suddenly learn to shoot and dribble over the offseason (Brook Lopez, AD, Embiid, etc.)."
"lol he hasn't even taken a 3 in 4 out of 7 games and he's averaging 1 attempt per game, he's not exactly Brook Lopez out there"
Brook Lopez is going through the same thing right now. It happens. Anyone that has back issues would understand this.
Too bad they had to settle for Brook Lopez and winning a championship instead
Hmm I mean I think reality is that Simmons is one of those players where it would be extremely hard to put the perfect team around him. He needs a ton of spacing around him but he also needs a rim protector next to him on defense. There's like one dude in the league that fits that mould in Brook Lopez lol. So you're almost always gonna have a non-ideal fit with him. Question is whether the benefits outweigh the detriments.
For Brook? You saying he the inferior Lopez?
"Gotta be tough to be a professional nba player but still just the ""worse brother"" at Thanksgiving dinner.  I feel for Brook Lopez."
"The way Brook Lopez, Marc Gasol and many other traditional C’s *completely* evolved their games to elongate their careers is really overlooked.  They went from not shooting 3s for the the first 8 years of their careers to becoming decent to good 3pt shooters on good volume. The league was phasing these types of players out of the league and they evolved to survive a lot longer than people expected."
Brook Lopez too
Why do you think I said he needs to reshape his game like Brook Lopez? Lopez had to reinvent himself in order to stay in the league and was committed to that. Boogie would have to do the same especially with how his injuries has warped his endurance
Lol Boogie would have to reshape his game somewhat like Brook Lopez to actually get back in the league with some real minutes.
"Just doing the playoffs teams, some players are pretty random:  Jazz: Donovan Mitchell  Memphis: Marc Gasol/Conley  Clippers: Griffin  Mavs: Dirk  Denver: Murray  Portland: Lillard  Phoenix: Nash  Lakers: Kobe  Philly: MCW  Washington: Wall  Knicks: Me7oooo  Atlanta: Alex Len  Bucks: Giannis  Miami: LeBron  Nets: Brook Lopez or Deron Williams  Celtics: Kevin Garnett"
"I feel like he's better known as ""How is Bam struggling against this guy"" because our dumb-as-bricks fanbase refuses to respect Brook Lopez as a great defender."
"Offensively it’s not really a fair comparison imo. Bam averaged 18.5 shots per 100 possessions this season, which is less than Herro, Butler, Dragic, and Nunn. Embiid averaged over 27, AD averaged over 25. So I don’t think he is used as a big enough part of Miami’s offense to expect him to be leading the way in that department.   It doesn’t help that the 1 on 1 matchup is tough. Brook Lopez is a really good post defender and the Heat can’t seem to find a way to exploit his pick and roll defense. He’s just dropping super deep, staying in the paint, and it’s working out because I don’t think they want Bam taking a ton of those mid range shots. You could say he’s at fault for that and should just be a better shooter, but imo it’s more on the coach to make adjustments in situations like that. If you’re not going to go all in and give Bam the green light on the pick and pop, you’ve gotta start doing something else.   Defensively, he makes some dumb plays occasionally but idk what to tell you if you think the Bucks scoring 130 was on him. They didn’t even score 50 of that 130 in the paint, and they only got to the line 20 times. He’s a really good defender, but one man can only do so much unless his name is Rudy Gobert.   Another reason Bam doesn’t catch as much criticism is that he’s on the definite underdog. I don’t think what happened last year is all that relevant, it’s been clear who the better team is this season. When you’re expected to win, a bad game is a much bigger deal than when you’re expected to lose. AD and Embiid also had hella hype coming into the league, and nobody expected much of Bam."
Both the Lopez’ play it a lot. I know brook uses it in practice to get his blocking motion down
I mean we can’t depend on him but playing Dedmon at 5 and Bam at 4 would surely make us better than playing Ariza and Bam. Ariza gets cooked on defense and doesn’t exist on offense and Bam is scared of Brook Lopez dominating the paint. Dedmon on Lopez and Bam on Giannis are better matchups.
"Wasn't Bam a very good midrange shooter this year, or at least recently? I don't know why he's refusing to pull the trigger when Brook Lopez gives him 6 feet of space. Not sure if that's a Spo thing or a Bam thing.       Either way, Bam's biggest weakness has always been his own mentality imo. I'm not calling him soft, but I don't think he's as consistent as he should be based on what he know he's capable of. He gets really passive at times."
"My guess is that Brook Lopez simply has Bam's number. Brook has more size, more experience and can stretch the floor more efficiently than Bam.     Agreed about Herro but you hear some of the beat writers mention about the organization/coaches not being happy w/ his behavior off court and it would make sense why Nunn gets the starting nod over him.      Plus the NBA hates us for not trading Herro for Harden so when he plays poorly it only confirms their bias."
"As a New Yorker, I'd like to see both Knicks and Nets do well. Been following the former since Linsanity days and the latter since the 2012-13 season. That Nets team had Joe Johnson, Brook Lopez, Deron Williams, Kris Humphries, MarShon Brooks."
"The heat have no anwser for Brook Lopez' size and they don't have the shooting to punish the Bucks for playing him, atleast not as long as Bam Adebayo keeps pretending he's allergic to taking shots.    In the possible matchup vs the Nets I think we'll see a lot more PJ Tucker as opposed to Brook Lopez."
"The game was over in the first 3 minutes when Bam (under instruction) came out aggressive but missed his first 3 mid ranges Lopez dared him to shoot, he stopped looking at the rim after that.   Bucks have really flipped Miamis strategy right on them, daring the Miami stars to shoot. Rather than Giannis guarding crowder last year and giving up open 3s when helping, guarding Jimmy and being able to sag and have Brook and Giannis in the paint has completely stifled the heat's offence."
Robin “Right Eye” Lopez  Brook “Brown Eye” Lopez
And 100% Brook Lopez because he is diminishing Butler’s will to drive to the rim every play by standing there.
I think it’s more like the Giannis and Brook Lopez effect. The length of them has completely neutralized Jimmy Butler’s attempts to drive to the rim and also made him very hesitant to take pullups. Lopez has also been bothering Bam by giving him absolutely nothing inside.
"You can't do this. You do this, means you have 3 players that can't shoot 3s on the floor. We only need to guard Robinson's 3s and GG - we're never losing the matchup down low with Brook and Giannis vs Dedmon and Bam.  Also who's guarding Lopez outside? Dedmon? You can't switch anymore either. Unless you want Jrue vs Dedmon ISO or something funny like that.  Your best bet is to let Dragic and Robinson literally take 15 threes each. Attacking the paint vs Brook and Giannis is dumb."
Brook Lopez
Toss up between robin lopez and brook Lopez. Gotta go with Robin though
Brook Lopez' brother
Brook Lopez.
"It’s fine as long as he has the reputation of a stretch to open up the floor for Giannis. Recently we have been running some good ol’ brook lopez post up plays too, and he’s very good at it still."
"I'd prefer the lineup score more points than a player score more points.  It's like Brook Lopez rebounding, I don't really care that he averages 6 boards if the team always wins the rebounding battle with him on the floor."
"well they had moved on from D'Angelo Russell at that point, who is a trash defender. he's back on the squad now. also Brook Lopez was the center and he's a very solid defender. I completely forgot about Josh Hart tho, imagine he's on this squad too."
brook lopez clamping bam and we all thought lopez would be played off the court this playoffs
Brook has no idea what to do with his hands when Brook Lopez is guarding him. Brook got him shook.
playing bam at centre was a mistake when you got the dpoy candidate brook lopez
Miami is treating Brook Lopez like a DPOY
ALL STAR BROOK LOPEZ MODE
REMEMBER WHEN BROOK LOPEZ WAS AN ALL STAR CALIBER?  TIME FLIES
"No, the Bucks are just this freaking good. I was saying how incredible flipping Bledsoe for Holiday was. Now Giannis has 2 bonafide all stars next to him and Brook Lopez as a 4th option.   Their bench got better as well. This is the Bucks that so many envisioned the last 2 years, the type of Bucks that could actually knock off everyone."
Brook Lopez HOF intimidator against Bam and Butler?
Brook Lopez legit commits a 3 second lane violation every other possession....
Most teams don't have Brook Lopez.
"Bam is scared of Lopez. It’s not disrespectful, Bam just second guesses everything when he guards him. He can’t do shit in the post against Brook."
The heat are like “we’ll just out muscle Giannis and Brook Lopez”
Brook Lopez was in the paint 12 seconds without guarding anyone lol
Brook Lopez 4 seconds in the lane again
Brook Lopez
Why is Bam so useless on offense? He has absolutely no midrange game and Brook Lopez is sagging so far off of him he's almost under the rim
Brook Lopez **
"Not only that, he was a rim protector at 6 foot four. Blocking guys like Dwight Howard, Brook Lopez, Tim Duncan. Pretty crazy to think about"
Miami needs to be able to contain Brook lopez
"Off the top of my head  LeBron - 2011 Finals, getting out-scored by Wade/Bosh/Jason Terry  Steph - 2016 Finals, blowing a 3-1 lead  Giannis - 2020 2nd Round, losing in 5 as the #1 seed and out-scored by Middleton/Brook Lopez after winning MVP/DPOY  Lillard - 2018 1st Round, swept as a #3 seed by Pelicans and shot 35/30/88 on 18PPG"
He botched a few names in Bucks vs. Heat. One of them being Pat Connaughton for Brook Lopez lol
Did anyone else notice in game 1 of Heat Bucks when he mixed up Pat Connaughton with Brook Lopez? They don't even look remotely similar lol
Can’t stand the Lopez brothers lol. Brook never misses against us
"Don't really care that people booed him but it didn't help their team.  In addition to that, I feel like not many people know Masai was starting a rebuild when he took over. They'd been decent in the playoffs but the decision was made that they were going to get rid of Kenyon and JR and rebuild.  Carmelo's trade request wasn't out of nowhere. It'd be like if the Bucks decided not to extend Middleton and then traded Brook Lopez. I think most of us would understand if Giannis wanted out. We'd also understand Bucks fans booing after that, but no one else would hold it against Giannis.  https://mobile.twitter.com/wojespn/status/1363927545117368325?lang=en"
"their center rotation is nick Claxton, old Blake Griffin, and washed DAJ. I saw what fucking TT and time lord did to them. BKN has to deal with a second round matchup of Gianni's and Brook Lopez, or Bam plus miami's physicality. Then there will be Simmons plus Embiid waiting for them.  they have murderers row coming up"
"Those contract are not hard to move.  If you have a player you extended - he must have shown some value, he won’t bring something back?  In the span of a few years Marks dumped Brook Lopez, Movgoz, and Allen Crabbe’s contracts."
"Bucks choking wasn’t luck it was Budenholzer being a fraud - the formula to shut Giannis down was to have Kawhi match him at halfcourt and direct him to the bigs stacking the paint; rest of the team was playing perimeter D with a focus on Middleton, daring role players to shoot.   Game 1 was lost because Brook Lopez stepped up and dropped 30 on us, game 2 was just an ugly blowout the Raps underperformed. 3 through 6 the strategy didn’t change but the Raps executed and the Bucks didn’t have random players get hot like that.  Miami did the same with Butler forcing Giannis into Bam last year. It’s a shortcoming of Giannis that he can’t create his own shot, and he needs to either fix that or take the LeBron route and translate his gravity to playmaking because the basis of defending him involves leaving someone open usually"
"You’re right, but have the Bucks ever shot close to their usual three-point percentage against the Heat in the playoffs? I feel like we’re not giving the Spo credit for game planning against the three. Same could be said for Brook Lopez guarding Bam so well that he shot that poorly."
Imagine if Luka had a Porzingis that was even as good as Brook Lopez is
I could say the same about Brook Lopez’ defending. The bad calls always go both ways. Officiating is just horrible in general
Weird how they called this but not Brook Lopez for 10 second violations
"I love Khris and Jrue  Brook Lopez, really fucking good game  My heart can't take one more game of this, let alone probably 6"
"I legit can't do this for a 7-game series. How was this only Game 1?   **We lost because our stars didn't play like stars.** Jimmy was our hero vs Milwaukee and the Lakers last year. He dropped 40 pts on the Bucks head Game 1 last year. Today, he was fucking horrific (outside of the game-tying shot in regulation) and missed every gimme close or open mid-range jumper. Every star in the NBA gets DESTROYED if they have a game where they shoot 4/21 in the playoffs. He's gonna get crushed here - and he deserves it after talking shit about being ""locked in"" and ""just get us to the playoffs, I'll take care of the rest"". I still believe he'll bounce back and be awesome. Herro was ice cold and reverted back to his 1st half season self.   Bam was also fucking pathetic and shouldn't skate on Jimmy's awful shooting performance. Brook Lopez played 10 feet off him every time like I was watching Ben Simmons on our team. Bam couldn't even punish him with a comfortable mid-range shot and forced these awful pull-up shots or barreled into the rim for a miss. I can't believe our 2 All-Stars put up such a shitshow while old ass Dragic and Duncan nearly won us the game.  This game was here for the taking. We missed our opportunity. I don't expect us to fold, but I don't expect the Bucks to have many games this series where they shoot 5/31 from 3 either. Wish Game #2 was tomorrow."
Brook Lopez looks like a Neanderthal
Brook Lopez is dragging the Bucks to a W
Brook Lopez showing Adebayo 0 fuckin respect there
Brook Lopez bailout ok
"Giannis can't shoot for shit, but I'll say it again Brook Lopez is useless at the end of games. Do what the Lakers did and play Giannis at the 5."
brook lopez shoulda been aware of the clock and known there wasnt enough time for Bam to get the pass so he shoulda helped way earlier on butler
LMAO BROOK LOPEZ
Brook Lopez shouldve fouled out of this game 2 quarters ago
Brook Lopez just grabbed Jimmy to prevent him from getting to the ball.
Brook Lopez literally grabbed butler lol
EJECT BROOK LOPEZ
"If Brook Lopez was from the Bahamas, would he be Brook Tropez?"
Why are you so desperate to post Brook Lopez to throw a pass like that
Why is Brook Lopez playing to close the game?
Brook Lopez would be working at Chili’s if refs called 3 second violations
Brook Lopez just daring Adebayo to shoot any midrange or floater
greatest hook shot shooters in Milwaukee history:   Robin Lopez   Brook Lopez
"Brook Lopez is the X factor in this game, the Heat can't properly defend him and even double teaming him doesn't work.  They need to knock him off the board with fouls (he already has 2), but because Bam is a shooter, you don't get those ticky-tack post fouls you usually get, which helps Brooks stay in the game."
I somehow ALWAYS forget brook Lopez used to consistently average 20ppg
Brook Lopez looks like the himbo in Emperor's New Groove
Robin Abdul Jabbar &gt; Brook Lopez
Hubie Brown randomly talking about Brook Lopez after Pat Connaughton scores 😂
I haven't watched any bucks games this year. Is Brook Lopez still really good? Feel like he's been around forever at this point.
i think so. no way does brook lopez have golden skin
"1. Giannis - duh 2. Holiday - best season of his career 3. Middleton - quintessential fit with Giannis 4. Portis - 6’10 and 47% on 3P’s 5. Divincenzo - Brook is 33 (sigh)  Toughest omissions: Brook Lopez, Brynn Forbes, Pat Connaughton"
"But if Draymond could consistently shoot (not at like Klay volume, but at like Brook Lopez volume), the Warriors wouldn’t be in the play in. Or, at the very least, they wouldn’t have lost in the play in.   It’s not even just that; his complete lack of ability to score for himself is a detriment to a team that needs scoring. I can’t deny he’d be a perfect fit for a team like the Nets who already has scorers in droves, but for the Klayless, 40ppg Curry Warriors, Dray needs to score consistently for them to win."
**Starters**  Steph Curry   Jrue Holiday   Justin Holiday   Giannis Antetokounmpo   Brook Lopez    **Bench**    LaMelo Ball   Marcus Morris   Seth Curry   Robin Lopez   Markieff Morris   Thanasis Antetokounmpo   Kostas Antetokounmpo    **Coaching staff**   Mike D'antoni   Dan D'antoni
"Possibly brook lopez too. If he can hit his 3s and stretch Bam out. For the heat, they need their 2nd year guys need to play like they did last year"
"Lopez is a mismatch on both sides of the floor. He is a walking, talking specimen of an era long gone. The rim protector that can *only* protect the rim and a scoring big with an inside game.  So, yes, teams moved away from having a full C (and Bam is still too small for a dinosaur like Lopez), so either play lighter Cs or none at all in certain lineups.  The issue w playing Lopez heavy minutes is that for every 2 he gives you, he allows a 3 on the other end. In fact I expect Spoelstra to adjust out of having to play Bam when Brook is on the floor... Eventually. In fact Spoelstra doesn't give a f*ck, he would bench some of his best players if it means that it gives him an advantage.   Bud on the other hand? I expect him to play Bropez 25-30 minutes consistently, sometimes more than that if the games go to OT. The minute I see Bud play Lopez 20 MPG or less on a series I would know that he has matured. But that's not ""our"" Bud, our Bud, from the Hawks days even, would play his best players regardless of lineups. It's as if he has no concept of matching up and thinks along the lines of a 2k rating system! (""Hmmm, that guy is an 80 overall, let's play him more than the 75 overall player"").  So, yeah, like I said. I expect the series to go either way, but I would be less surprised if Bucks win it on talent alone (last year I was a Heat in 6 kind of guy given how I *knew* Bud would defend and ... voila, though Giannis' injury did help my prediction go along a bit *too* nicely). As for the Nets, they are a very vulnerable team and much like the Bucks can (and will) win on talent alone. They are bit lucky that they find the Bucks instead of the sixers on the 2nd round. I mean Doc Rivers is not some kind of coaching genius, but at least he is not a blithering fool like the one the Bucks have.  And, yeah... In a battle of talents. Nets win (though they may well lose the ECF).."
So we gonna act like Brook Lopez isnt elite?
"Unfortunately they don’t hand out dpoy’s to people thatre only good at shot blocking  Maybe all all-nba defense team tho, like brook lopez last year lmao"
Brook Lopez is the first NBA player to play for two teams at once.
Brook lopez????
"I don't think we should be expected to beat the Nets anyway - Bus is actually lucky because people aren't gonna blame him too much if he takes the Nets to 6 or something, even though I am confident, having watched so many series, that the Nets atrocious defense can be abused by a good coach, making it really tough for them to outscore you. They still might, but you have a good chance.  Bud's biggest problem is... screens. Screen happen, means players - even Giannis - have to chase and go over it. Good shooters will just fire at will, that second the screen gives them is enough.  At the same time, you give away free midrange shots as Brook is literally waiting under the rim. The answer to all that is simple: switch and don't play Brook. I think Bud is going to either do this, or he will play Brook and exploit the fact the Heat like to play with Bam and 4 shooters.   He's gonna feed Brook down low and he's gonna have someone like Herro, Ariza or even Robinson on him. He's gonna eat them alive. Olynyk is gone, Crowder is gone, now Bam has to be on Giannis. If Bam is on Brook and Ariza on Giannis, Bam will have to leave the paint to guard Brook's 3 and both Jrue and Giannis will drive and score easily. The Heat do not have what it takes to stop both Giannis and Brook. Call me stupid, but I fully expect Lopez to win the Heat series while everyone talks about Giannis and Jrue."
Fucking Brook Lopez aka Human Moving Screen.
I’m sure Brook Lopez can challenge him
"They absolutely did not have the Lakers on the brink lol. Butler had an all-time game to take that series as long as it went, but there was nothing left in the tank after that. And anyone who makes that Milwaukee team out to be super talented is smoking crack. You really think Brook Lopez and Khris Middleton are that high quality of running mates? Hell Bledsoe was actively a liability."
Honestly he gets clamped almost every year in play-off. Just the same thing every year where russ is left wide open to take threes and brick them.  Why does he not even improve like fucking brook lopez who was a post-up big became a spot up shooter. Why can’t russ also improve his shooting to level where he can’t be left open.
"Wizards' 3pt defense was just atrocious.  Beal and Westbrook weren't good, but none of the Wizards came prepared for this game, besides Ish Smith and maybe Brook Lopez.    Also the Wizards would've been better off with Rui fouling out in the third than ending the game with 5 fouls. Tatum was absolutely cooking Beal. Who else on the Wizards could've slowed him?"
"It's Brook Lopez. Who else is a heavy footed 7ft center bombing 30fters, while having beautiful post moves, hitting dirk fades and locking down the paint on the other end."
"I assume most teams could do a long chain backwards connecting players. i.e., Joe Harris to Brook Lopez to Vince Carter to Jason Kidd to Kerry Kittles to Yinka Dare to Kenny Anderson and so on and so forth."
Brook Lopez.
So a top-10 pick and Brook Lopez would win more than 35 games in the Western Conference?  Lol okay.
"Brook Lopez too, all lakers"
We’re going to have to switch and close with Tucker instead of Lopez against the good shooting teams. Need Brook for a potential Philly matchup tho. We also go under screens even when we switch so we still give up a ton of 3s.
"Interesting you brought up the defense. They aren’t bad but they’re in a decline (down to 10th), and I have to wonder how much of that has to do with Brook Lopez. He’s not as good as he was a couple of years ago."
I remember back when Kidd was the Nets coach he was supposedly pushing them hard to trade Brook Lopez to Milwaukee. And then shortly after he forced his way out of his contract and signed a deal to coach the Bucks. And Nets fans were like that Charlie Day meme. Lol
"Prime Brook Lopez was back when he was a Net and had no 3 point shot. KP can’t work to his spot because he’s too weak, the shorter defender has the leverage and can stop KP from backing them down by jus using an arm. He has to bulk up if he wants to play in the post, he can’t even back down Marcus Smart."
"They'd just play him at power forward he doesn't have to guard guys like Embiid, Giannis, or Bam. He'd match up perfectly fine against a guy like Ariza. He might get bullied a bit by Brook Lopez but it's not like he's a go to scorer. He might have some trouble against the Sixers but even still Harris isn't super quick or he could play sag off defense against Ben Simmons."
“Babbling Brook” Lopez
"he's one of the worst Xs and Os coaches in the league, Bud literally took a 43 win team to a 60+ win team with the biggest addition being Brook Lopez after Kidd was gone"
"Prime Brook Lopez is a great example of a how a guy can use his size and still be perimiter oriented. Just work to your spots and take the shot you want because you are fucking 7'3, no one is going to block your jumper. Why does he rush it and fade away even when he has guards on him it makes no sense."
He doesnt fit the Mavericks system.  &amp;#x200B;  He would KILL IT as a Brook Lopez replacement for Bucks though.... I mean Brook is still good but he's not getting younger.
"Lmao actually, soft, less intense Brook Lopez"
Brook Lopez but worse at everything
"lol shit brook lopez, mixin him up with griffin  brook blake its all just basic white millenial woman baby names amirite"
Oof. Especially rough as the Lakers chose not to re-sign Brook Lopez when he is exactly what they needed
"If Brook Lopez ends up being the Nets downfall I won't know how to feel...  Honestly, kind of Paul Newman in *Road to Perdition*:  ""I'm glad it's you."""
This is a test for Coach Bud. I'm curious to see how he adjust and especially how he uses Brook Lopez.
"Maybe not the best, but brook Lopez for 4/$52M is a steal imo. Elite rim protector and all around offensive game."
13M/yr is Christian Wood/Brook Lopez money.
Serious question  OP do you really think anyone gives a fuck about the Olympics?   There is such a lack of players who give a fuck that the 2019 team included:  Harrison Barnes Mason Plumlee Brook Lopez Derrick White and Marcus Smart
"To each their own.   I followed the Nets since the 2012 - 13 season, when they had Joe Johnson and Brook Lopez as they are in NYC like myself. Most fun Nets team was the 2018-19 Nets. That team had heart. 2012 - 15 Nets were pretty litty too. I am not a big fan of super teams myself but as long as teams give something to get that push, then I won't care."
"And one inch taller than [this Bucks lineup from 2019](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201903020UTA.html):  Khris Middleton (6'8"")  Giannis Antetokounmpo (6'11"")  Nikola Mirotic (6'10"")  Ersan Ilyasova (6'10"")  Brook Lopez (7'0"")  Remarkably no player is shorter than 6'8"". Adding their heights together gets to a total of 411 inches."
They need a Brook Lopez.
Giannis will carry Steph on his shoulders while Brook Lopez wards off defenders.
"Brook Lopez, serge Ibaka Montrezl Harrell Dwight Howard all guys with under 15 mil contracts"
Brook Lopez is good and Robin Lopez is pure evil
"I think the x-factor is Brook Lopez.   If he doesn't get played off the floor, the Bucks have a chance."
Just realized how much of a steal brook Lopez was for 4/$52M
Feels like every time Brook Lopez plays the Knicks he shoots 100% from 3
He’s not a star at this point. He’s scuffed Brook Lopez.
Brook Lopez
Brook Lopez exists
Brook Lopez 🥰
"Now they do. You guys have hella ignorant. They still started with no assets, a bad FO, a bunch of old ass players and Brook Lopez. They could have easily been like the Kings or the Knicks? Been a terrible franchise for years, now just the players, but internally.   They kept their cap space open, while still holding onto decent players to make the team enticing for these stars. When the team has infinite cap space but still has Levert, Dinwiddie, Allen, Joe Harris, now it’s an easy decision  Is going to the Magic an easy decision right now? Hell no   Why didn’t they choose to go to the Knicks? You know the answer   They did a complete reversal of their team in just a few years, that is impressive and lots of franchises can’t"
"Naw in the heat series,  brook lopez is playing close to the bucket, giannis goes one on one a lot less,  hes letting jrue and middleton playmake more allowing giannis to play near the basket. Plus seeing how each defensive rebound was a challange against tristian thompson and Grant, id like to see how lopez,  giannis and portis do"
"Honestly I don't understand why people keep saying Brook will get played off the court. Bucks don't always switch 1-5 and when they do, usually Lopez isn't on the court for it. They spent the regular season experimenting with defensive schemes and it seems like they don't like Brook switching in most situations. They will either not switch at all or switch 1-4 with Brook staying in drop coverage which has worked well for the Bucks."
"&gt;Brook Lopez vs Nets matchup is confirmed. This, along with the ongoing Mike Conley vs Grizzlies series, marks the first time two franchise point leaders have faced their former team in the playoffs at the same time.  No way Lopez is ahead of Kidd, petrovic dr J wtf"
"I can see Giannis passing the ball to Brook Lopez, only to hit James Harden's head."
"It sucks because of how much both teams invested in building their rosters as is that one of their seasons is guaranteed to end in the 2nd round. Whichever team loses is gonna have to hear all off-season ""they traded and spent so much only to not even make the conference finals"" even though its obvious both teams as is are legit championship contenders who would be favored to come out the East any of the previous 3 years (Nets thats obvious, this years Bucks make it to the Finals last year for sure and were 2 games away from the Finals with a worse team in 2019, either make it out in 2018). Granted the Nets would hear a lot more of that noise and people would give the Bucks a pass for losing to them but still. After all the questions about Giannis and his ability to lead a team in the playoffs, it finally seems to start to come together for him this season both with his own improvements and the improvements to the roster around him, only for him to face this Nets team in the 2nd round. People will give some leeway because of the Nets talents but we know the talk about Giannis in the playoffs will continue and as a fan of Giannis, I think its unfair.   I've been cheering hard for the Bucks to win these past 2 years once the Nets were out because I like Giannis a lot and I really wanted Brook Lopez to win a ring, and I wanted that to happen when we werent truly contending. Now we have to beat them to get there and it sucks because this could very well have been the Bucks best chance.   Gonna be an absolute bloodbath of a series. I still have us winning  but dear lord I am legit scared of this Bucks team even with Dontes injury. Jrue is such an upgrade over Bled, Giannis continues his improvement, and Bud has improved as a coach as well. Its going 7 and I think our talent wins out but man its gonna be something to see for sure."
Brook Lopez
"One of my close friends is a big die-hard Nets fan, and he likes the Bucks second because of Brook Lopez. This is going to be a somewhat awkward series for him"
Brook Lopez will be played off the floor.
Bucks. Who is stopping Giannis and Brook Lopez in the paint?
Impossible to hate the Bucks when Brook Lopez is an integral part of their team
"Is it not reasonable to expect that someone as incredibly athletic as Ben Simmons could be a Giannis-type threat slashing to the rim, or even learn post moves to capitalize on mismatches?  If the answer to that question is ""He can't do that playing next to Embid, there's no spacing, paint is too clogged"", or some variation of that, then they should trade Simmons.  If they can play together, it'll HAVE to be because Simmons is slashing to the rim like Giannis and Embiid has figured out how to be glorified Brook Lopez on the perimeter, OR Simmons has learned how to shoot jumpers to space for Embiid.  I don't really understand this obsession with keeping Simmons in Philly if next to Embiid he is a 3D guy who can't shoot 3's.  Embiid has demonstrated that he can be an MVP caliber super star in this league playing down low and banging bodies, and to do that he needs spacing. The time to experiment with Simmons is over, they should have traded Simmons for Harden, or Simmons for Jrue, and solved this mess."
Brook Lopez if I'm not mistaken
"They're learning to shoot threes, not mid-range jumpers that consistently go in off the low-mid post.  Threes aren't anywhere similar to those types of shots, don't require the same fakes nor foot-work. It's literally not even remotely the same and having a big man shoot threes, while more efficient, is nowhere near as skilled. Brook Lopez has turned into a three point shooter, but he was much more of a versatile scorer in his prime. People mistake the idea that just because threes are more efficient and from a longer distance that they're more 'skilled'."
"Christian Wood,Brook Lopez,Markelle Fultz,Robert Covington,Jusuf Nurkic,Jordan Clarkson,TJ Warren,Spencer Dinwiddie,Seth Curry,Joe Ingles and Jae Crowder  All these players make the same or less amount of money as Kuzma next year"
"Why is no one giving the Lopez brothers credit? First Brook going 11-15 FG scoring 25 points in 28 minutes, carrying the Bucks and sweeping the heat, and now Robin going 8-11 getting 16 points in 19 minutes. Lopez brothers are underrated asf."
Glad to see the Lopez brothers are still doing their thing. Both of them are getting solid minutes in the post season as old vets. Brook is killing it too on the Bucks as their 3&amp;D center
"Teams are built differently now a days but he was basically Derick Fisher or Ron Harper...  A modern day comp for current title contenders:   Nets: Joe Harris   Bucks: Brook Lopez   Sixers: Seth Curry   Lakers: Schroeder   Clippers: Morris or Ibaka   Jazz: Bogdanovic   Basically, he was a key contributor on a championship caliber team. Not a superstar, not an all star but a key contributor."
"This comment just made me realize that Brook Lopez, the Nets leading scorer, is going up against them in the playoff. I wonder if that has ever happened before. Also, he is definitely going to play very well against them."
"Brook Lopez? A bit of a stretch, he's a good center, but not really an all star."
Brook and Robin Lopez have the best hook shots in the league
"The Bucks have a FC of Giannis and Brook Lopez, both all-defense level players  If yall see them in the CFinals you’ll see"
"1. I thought Dinwiddie and Harris were originally on the team  2. Tough for the Nets to draft anyone when the Celtics owned all their picks. Even their star before, Dlo, was traded there for Brook Lopez and Kuzma"
Hey we love Brook Lopez to be fair lol.   To this dad he and Deron Williams are my only Nets jerseys
Brook Lopez incoming lol
"Brook Lopez will be better than Lebron, heard it here first"
"Matchups matter.  The Heat roster is flawed because we lacked size and used multiple lackluster defenders in our rotation.  So, not only did we have to deal with Giannis and Middleton’s shenanigans, but we were getting worn down by Brook Lopez’s rebounding and Jrue Holiday’s craftiness.    Were there adjustments to be made?  Of course.  Bam needed to play alongside a proper Center to limit Brook Lopez (which shouldn’t be a statement in 2021, but hey), so we could’ve used more Bam+Dedmon lineups.  Forbes also turned into 2013 Finals Danny Green because our players refused to stay attached to him and he found all the confidence he needed to keep shooting.  Throw in a Heat team that looked depleted after Game 1 and there’s not much that you can do.  No amount of coaching is gonna save Dragic and Herro from getting worked in the post by Jrue."
"Takeaways from this game:  1. The bucks chemistry just isn’t there. They came together defensively in big moments, especially brook lopez, but offensively they have very little chemistry.   2. Giannis basketball IQ seems lacking, he shot way too many 3 pointers, dribbles the ball in iso too much and it seems like between him and Middleton they don’t share the ball well but just play iso ball and take I’ll advised shots, sometimes they go in."
Giannis pullup 3s and Bruce fukin bowen contested floaters over Brook Lopez. Great offense in my book
Their half court offense just lacks versatility and creativity. Lopez and Tucker are both subpar shooters but they have to stay planted behind the arc basically because Giannis is gonna be involved in every action. I like Brook or Jrue attacking a mismatch in the post but its easy to double when Middleton is the only shooter that really scares you.
Brook Lopez in game 3: Am I a joke to you?
Brook Lopez reinventing himself as an elite rim protector who only shoots spotup 3s &gt;&gt;&gt;
Some of the worst late possessions from both teams I’ve ever seen. Props to Brook “Mutumbo” Lopez for taking away some easy buckets though.
Brook Lopez is MVP of this game in my opinion
Brook Lopez gotta be the unsung hero of this game for the Bucks; 6 huge blocks and defending Brown’s go-ahead shot with less than 10 seconds to go
I have never been more confident in the Nets than I am in this series.  The offensive execution for the Bucks is awful.  From the Giannis pull ups to abandoning the pick and roll that has worked all game.  The lack of spacing and ball movement and the idiotic defense outside of Brook Lopez rim protection.
"Holy shit Brook Lopez DOMINATED that game .. that was like Tim Howard in the 2014 World Cup.   His PNR defense + rim protection was insane, he was the Bucks MVP tonight"
Brook Lopez actually won the DPOY upon further review
the only two bucks players who should be getting any praise for this game are brook lopez and bobby portis i dont wanna hear nothing about middleton
I watched Bruce Brown get sonned all game long by brook lopez and he still kept trying it lmfao
Bruce Brown playing with the best offensive player on the planet and he drives against 7 foot Brook Lopez⁉️⁉️⁉️
"Not just cold shooting, but Brook Lopez getting 5 blocks. So not just all on cold shooting"
"Refs need to check Brook Lopez for foreign substances, because the spin rate he got on that air ball was unnatural."
Brook Lopez is getting away with defensive 24 seconds every possession
"Brook lopez providing great rim protection, but do we really want KD getting wide open at 15 feet late in a must win game?"
Wtf Brook Lopez is elite on defense  tonight
Lmao Brook Lopez is just chilling there waiting to block these shots
"Brook ""Dikembe Mutombo"" Lopez"
"The NBA has had a quick trigger on breaking up fights since Malice at the Palace. If Brook Lopez and Joe Harris got into it, it wouldn't be any different. There are plenty of real race issues in this country without people looking for one in every single situation."
Count how many seconds Brook Lopez camps in the paint for lol
"Brook Lopez has all the skills Giannis needs, just needs to spend a summer focusing on it with his own teammate"
imagine if we gave brook lopez his contract :(
Brook Lopez borderline unplayable
How does brook lopez have zero points
Bro brook lopez has to step up KD wide open jumpers ????
Watching Brook Lopez is so annoying
"Well the thing is, they want to play Brook Lopez, who has the speed and agility of a glacier."
Adjustment for the Bucks needs to be benching Brook Lopez and just spamming the Middleton/Giannis empty side PnR which allows Giannis to just roll to the rim.
Brook Lopez getting floater-ed to death really sparked that comback.
Lopez going back to being used purely as a spacer. Not it's not the right thing because if he posted up they'd just help of Giannis and Brook will never ever pass the ball. But that makes their scoring options really limited
"not only did they get great penetration in the first they even forced blake griffin to sit with foul trouble  but do the bucks capitalize, noooo lets chuck some 3 pointers and let brooklyn tee off on brook lopez"
Brook Lopez getting torched beyond belief
And Bruce brown was feasting on brook lopez stupid defence and brook lopez doesn't use his post game today and just sit at corner
"Brook Lopez should be playing exactly zero minutes this series, run Giannis at Center and play Portis more. Losing a 21 point lead to fucking BRUCE BROWN is more embarrassing than getting swept"
"just a highlight reel of brook lopez getting lit up, please play giannis at center"
Brook Lopez...Jrue Holiday...PJ Tucker...IS ANYONE ALIVE OUT THERE?
We live in a world where 6’4 Bruce Brown is sonning 7’0 Brook Lopez
Brown is cooking Brook Lopez.
brook lopez is really unimpressive this series
GET BROOK LOPEZ OUT THE GAME RIGHT THE FUCK NOW
Brook Lopez has been unplayable this series damn
How is brook lopez still in this game?
This guy is really risking his career on brook Lopez. Coach bud is such a dumb ass just play Portis
Why is Brook Lopez on the floor again?
Are u trying to win the series having Brook Lopez post up smaller players? He doesn’t have it anymore honestly
Coach bud needs to be fired. Brook Lopez just gave up 4 layups on the pick and roll so you keep him in?
"If you think brook lopez is the worst, ask a blazers fan…"
Brook Lopez who was once a terrific post player is being defended by a point guard a lot. Get this man some post-ups. This shit is not rocket science
I thought Drummond and Gasol were the two worse pick n roll defensive players ever… Until I saw Brook Lopez…
Can someone explain to me what the purpose of Brook Lopez is? He had fucking Joe Harris on him and he’s content to stand outside and miss 3s.   There was a point where Lopez was one of the best players on the block in the league. You can’t post up Joe Harris?
"It’s a crime how poorly Brook Lopez is utilized. He will have Kyrie on him, but we just have him sit in the corner the whole possession and then take a contested jumper. Such bad offense."
"Lool at brook Lopez, the guy has zero mobility, Bruce is attacking him at the rim and gets what he wants. Lopez has to be benched and giannis has to play center"
Bud needs to bench Brook Lopez and just play Tucker at 5 . The Nets don’t have a true center anyways
Brook Lopez needs a map
Brook Lopez is unplayable in this series. Bruce Brown is murdering him
how is bud a coach when he lets brook lopez getting torched 5 CONSECUTIVE TIMES in defense by fucking brown?
Y’all gonna complain about the super team cuz Bruce brown is destroying Brook Lopez inside?
Why is Brook Lopez out there? This matchup when Claxton’s not on the floor is a nightmare for Brook Lopez to defend. Seriously?! Lopez on Brown?! Give me a break
"Rim protector Brook Lopez getting torched by 6'4"" Bruce brown lol"
Sterling brown getting layups of brook lopez is just brutal to watch
Brook Lopez with 0 rim protection
What the fuck is Brook Lopez doing
Brook Lopez shouldn't play another minute of this series.
Brook Lopez is getting feasted on because of that dumb drop coverage they’re playing
Does Brook Lopez not remember any post moves? Joe Harris is guarding him and Giannis takes a 3. Wtf kind of offense is that?

"&gt; The national basketball team for Yugoslavia if it still existed would be nuts and could 100% take down Team USA.  I think 100% beating Team USA is hyperbolic unless they're playing the same 2019 roster, in this hypothetical scenario, which included: Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Joe Harris, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Donovan Mitchell, Mason Plumlee, Marcus Smart, Jayson Tatum, Myles Turner, Kemba Walker, Derrick White.  That being said, a Yugoslavian team would wreck shop."
"They do have shooters. Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez and PJ Tucker were all intended to be complementary shooters to pair with Giannis’ interior scoring. It’s a coaching issue, and a Giannis ft issue."
"People keep saying this, but Brook Lopez is honestly one of the only stretch 5s in the league that isnt on a max. Giannis has more spacing than most guys"
"The gap between the team the US put out two years ago and its best team is massive. If the US actually sent their best players, you're looking at something like:  Steph curry, LeBron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, Draymond Green, and DeAndre Ayton.   The team that they actually sent was:  Marcus smart, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen brown, Harrison Barnes, Derrick white, Mason plumlee, Khris Middleton, Kemba walker, Joe Harris, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, and Donovan Mitchell."
brook lopez?
"Some key points touched on in the video:   Brooklyn after switching all year is now playing drop coverage even with switchable defenders like claxton and Durant. Reason why is likely the lack of respect for jrue mid range jumper and Giannis has no pick and pop threat.    Brooklyn is attacking brook Lopez in the drop coverage every possession. Durant and kyrie shoot 50% from mid range and can either hit the jumper or when help comes off shooters Durant has been finding guys for threes.    Brooklyn is predictably roasting Bryn Forbes by attacking their hedge and recover strategy by hitting Forbes with another screen off the recovery by a third guy, example given is by claxton. Also shamet/Harris are slipping screen at the peak of the hedge timing it perfectly for open shots.   Overall the nets defensively are playing shooters effectively. The only one they are giving proper respect to are Forbes and middleton to a lesser extent. Jrue and brook are being played off of to give help when necessary.   Durant attacks each defender in different ways. Against Giannis he is consistently isoing him and going back and forth to attack his foot speed laterally. Against jrue he has gone into the post to avoid his dribble being contested and then shooting over or hitting with counter post moves. Against tucker he puts him into the pick and roll, tucker has not been great getting over screens and they’re attack him in this area.   It appears the nets coaching staff pushed literally every right button this game and had a counter to every strategy the bucks threw at them. When they went to the zone it did slow the nets down temporarily but the nash counter was Bruce brown playing the center of the floor where he thrives with his floater and kicking to shooters."
"That would just put an even bigger emphasis on outside shooting, and I think we’re seeing enough long jump shots chucked up as it is.  The league experimented with not enforcing defensive three seconds with Brook Lopez in the Miami series this year, and it destroyed any opportunity to score in the paint."
"The Raptors had better players across the board and weren’t as reliant on a floor bound, non switching big like the Bucks are in Brook Lopez."
"&gt;Among centers, Ayton trails only Brook Lopez in total jumpers defended this season. Despite allowing opponents to shoot a career-high 40 percent on such shots in the regular season, he’s improved that figure to 31 percent in his first playoff run.   Brook Lopez is not the guy I wouldve guessed to be first on this list."
He's getting a ton of value out of their role players. What is there to say? Partially it's on the Bucks for not attacking those weaker defensively but you have to credit the Nets for trusting those guys.  We'll see if that holds but like Brook Lopez taking fadeways vs Mike James is a joke. Pound the ball and go at him.
"I mean, Giannis at least played well in Game 1 of the Semifinals. Paul George, on the other hand...  Should also be noted that Paul George has better teammates than Giannis does (I'd take Kawhi Leonard, Marcus Morris, Serge Ibaka, and Lou Williams in a heartbeat over Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday, and Brook Lopez)."
"Yes analytics guys like Ben Taylor also watch film and understand schemes. Still doesn’t change the fact that they were completely wrong about KD and Kyrie. Do you realize that the Nets were blowing out the Bucks by 49 points at one point? A Bucks team that has Jrue Holiday, Giannis, Khris Middleton along with Brook Lopez, PJ Tucker, and other solid role players. There is a swagger to the game of basketball that dudes like Ben Taylor don’t understand. Kyrie and KD only combined for 54 points but the way in which they scored was amazing and effortless. It made the Bucks hesitant to play their gritty, physical style and they fell into the trap of trying to match KD and Kyrie’s coolness/ swagger/ shotmaking ability which very few can do. Not only that. When you see your teammates making highlight reel type plays every trip down the court it gives the teammates supreme confidence. Bruce Brown’s floater game was on another level. Landry Shamet banged two back to back laser beam three pointers.   In short, basketball is about confidence and when you have two of the most skilled scorers ever on your team who don’t let the ball stick in their hands then that confidence becomes infectious. There are no analytics for this. Ben Taylor probably knows this but chooses not to bring it up because again there are no analytics for this."
"I love this question. Draymond and Roberson are such good system defenders, their communication and “quarterbacking” the defence would make nets actions more sloppy and the overall team defence would make and sets inefficient most definitely. However one on one I think that the presence of Big Ben would be somewhat of a liability - if the nets go small and have Bruce brown/Blake on with the big three he’s essentially sitting in the corner leaving the mid post and paint open for the big three to attack. KD could effectively still pull up over draymond/rodman and if he’s on, good luck. Harden has the physicality to get to the rim, even on a great defender. If Big Ben can remain effective sitting in the paint similarly to how brook lopez did against Miami, they severely slow BK down. If not then they just make them inefficient"
"Drummond? What about Kat, brook lopez, Myles turner or Jarrett Allen? Also you have Tatum twice and if you’re actually trying to pick positions I really think pg and kawhi playing pf is a little out there. Not a huge deal but for sure there are better centers than Drummond  Edit: forgot Zion as well although obviously he’s more of a pf"
"Brook Lopez, Bobby Portis and Bryn Forbes as your 4th, 5th, and 6th best players is absolutely horrendous outside of Lopez. Forbes has struggled to stay on an NBA roster for years and now he gets big minutes for the Bucks lol.    Nets are pretty deep. Griffin and Harris are really good role players. Brown, Shamet, and Claxton are solid too.   Not even compatible, stop making a fool of yourself lol"
"Also Brook Lopez, Bogut and Hibbert."
"he loved brook lopez lmao, probably mostly to spite dwight howard  https://www.netsdaily.com/2013/10/28/5039280/shaq-nets-heat-brook-lopez-best-center-nba-tnt-charles-barkley"
I don't know what it is about the Lakers and letting big men that work with the team walk away from them. Brook Lopez is another one that comes to mind. He would have been perfect on this Lakers team and is from Fresno California. Probably grew up a Lakers fan during the Shaq and Kobe years.
"budenholzer would put brook lopez in single coverage on trae. ""hey he's 7 foot, trae is 6'1, can't beat him, right?"""
"nets are pretty ""analytical"" and they figured out how to run an effective offense against the super long and athletic bucks by utilizing solid fundamentals.   put brook in a drop when he's supposed to be guarding Brown/Griffin? ok, we'll run pnr and get a free midrange shot every time. Or mix it up and run a pick and pop with whoever's guarded by Forbes, then have the pop guy get a screen right after by lopez's man and get a free wide open 3 for shamet or harris b/c Lopez isn't anywhere near the play.   the issue is bud is a fucking clown and can't figure out how to adjust to what other teams are doing."
"I don't think people understand the wall, even with the detailed explanations of what it is on TV, YouTube, or this sub. They also don't understand  what OP is saying. If he touches the paint, with or without the ball, the wall will be formed. If he drives, from anywhere on the court, the wall will be formed. If he posts up, with or without the ball, the wall will be formed. Depending on which one of those he does and where he does it from, the team that walls him will either let two guys shade him or a soft triple team. The way to punish that is the get the ball to shooters, cut, or a post fade/hook. Giannis can't consistently fade or hook, and no one on the team, other than him, cuts when they don't have the ball. That leaves the shoot option. You can't punish a team leaving shooters open when the shooters they leave open are shooting worse than Westbrook with 0 of his playmaking ability. And like I said, they don't cut.   OP is saying that while Giannis struggled in Game 2, his teammates are contributing to his struggles, by letting the Nets take away his strengths. The Superstar-to-Supporting Piece relationship is supposed to be Symbiotic, but so far in this series Brook Lopez is the only guy helping out."
"TBH Jrue, Middleton, Brook Lopez are much better scoring options than Draymond/Wiggins/whoeverthefuckelseisstartingthisgameforus.  Bud is just awful at adjusting throughout a series"
&gt;When he was on brooklyn he was one of the best low post scorers in the game. At times during the last game the nets had joe Harris guarding him and brook was just standing at the corner 3 not doing anything  They should have him slide from the corner to the dunkers spot if they put a guard on him. If they wall of Giannis its an easy lob over the top to a waiting Lopez who will definitely score over a much smaller opponent.   Or actually kick it to him to shoot over the little guy.
You should have seen Brook Lopez in our series vs Milwaukee. Dude might as well have set up a tent in the damn lane
Is he? He would replace brook lopez and he’s prob better
"I agree.  I think the main issue is that he still builds his offensive and defensive schemes too heavily around Lopez.   That works great in the regular season, but in the later rounds of the playoffs when every opponent has very good to god-tier jump shooters, they're going to exploit the hell out of Brook's drop coverage on the defensive side. And ugh, that zone.  On the offensive side, good defenses with good personnel will just pack the paint and let brook try to win the game as a pick and pop guy. That ain't happening."
"I don't know if they should necessarily shift him to center cause of brook lopez, but they need to use him as if he is one cause what else does giannis really do on the offensive end other than set screens if he's not scoring? Honestly even watching last year's playoffs, Middleton looked like their #1 option a lot of times, and esp in crunch time, with giannis relegated to being a screen setter pretty much"
i mean just look to the dudes own teammate Brook Lopez
Brook(lyn) Lopez
"Take brook lopez out of the strting line up. Go small, help defense. Gianiss and PJ needs to be at Kd all the time"
"If you're a coach of a team and somebody tells you KD is guarding Brook Lopez, and Blake is guarding Giannis. Oh and they're not getting doubled. How excited are you for those matchups?"
Brook lopez?????
"lol, people acting like Ben's a scrub. He does so many things well. I'd take him in a heartbeat.   The Philly roster isnt constructed around his strengths, like you said. Ben would shine on a team constructed like the Bucks, with a center like Brook Lopez"
"Agree, Capela is very underrated and can pose serious problems for the Bucks.      Hawks will likely have to resort to switching and help defense just to contain Giannis in the paint. But most likely, they'll just force him to shoot the 3. Or let him pass to Jrue from the three (clearly not ideal, but Jrue has been struggling a bit in the playoffs - despite clutch moments)     Bucks will have to overplay their starters, as their bench will get destroyed by the Hawks' depth.      I'm curious, do we know how good John Collins is at boxing out? Cause Brook Lopez is incredible at boxing out, which tremendously helps his teammates get rebounds. So I can see him doing a decent job containing Capella, unless Collins can do the same."
Simmons CJ McCollum Duncan Robinson OG Anunoby  Brook Lopez
Blake Griffin and Brook Lopez are examples of guys that developed a shot much later in their career to change their game
"2010’s  PG - John Wall  SG - Jimmy Butler  SF - DeMar DeRozan  PF - Giannis  C - Brook Lopez  Bench: Jamal Crawford, Joe Johnson, Joakim Noah"
"We need a guard that can create for others, and hopefully not completely useless at shooting. Because running Coby/Zach at point guard just ain't it, both of them score-first guards.  Ben Simmons doesn't really solve anything for us, he actually creates more problems because his inability to shoot would displace Vucevic further into being a stretch 5 ala Brook Lopez."
"Especially in this current era where a center shows up with a 3 point shot after like, one offseason. Brook freaking Lopez, the living embodiment of an old school traditional center, leant how to shoot threes at a relatively okay clip after one summer, there is no excuse why Ben can't do the same."
"It's not a matter of scoring, it's about defending Giannis and brook lopez. Clippers really miss Ibaka"
"Im not acting like he’s a 3 point threat, but back your basketball 101 LOL Capela was almost played out of the league in Houston because he was such a liability on defense. He’s going to be stretched further this series than last, Brook Lopez is absolutely not some big threat behind the line, however if you are going to leave him open his more than capable of hitting that shot. Capela won’t be able to live in the paint and lane during this series that’s all I’m getting at."
I’m not moving the goal posts. 😂🤣🤣 you sent the chart not me. Brook Lopez was the main reason the heat got blown out!??! 😂😂🤣😂🤣🤣🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 it definitely was the fact that Jimmy Butler went ice cold and was out scored by Brynn Forbes. I can’t reply to your dumb ass anymore
Stop moving the goal post. Brook Lopez has been a good rim protector and the bucks have a very strong defence because of it. In fact brook lopez was the main reason the heat got blown out.
"Bud's after timeouts are amazingly terrible.   Just like you said, ends with some terrible shot.  For example, Brook Lopez forgot the shot clock but how did your ATO play with game and season on the line end up with Lopez with the ball in the corner while guarded tightly."
Brook Lopez and Jakob Poetl must be elite defenders too because their teams also funneled players to them…
"Bucks go cold and brainless at times but they just have so many weapons. Giannis does his thing, khris can drop 40, jrue can hit timely shots and defends great. Brook Lopez hits his threes and gets blocks. Hell even Pat connaughton had timely shots in the first half last game. Meanwhile nets couldn't get a joe Harris basket."
"LOL he does play on a superteam. Relax brah he was playing 1 on 1 with brook lopez, if he didn't have those numbers it'd be an embarrassment."
Simmons isn't a good defender at the 5 at all.  A good scoring big won't have to look to switch. They'll just keep scoring on Simmons and force the team to switch Simmons away.   His value comes from guarding the perimeter and attacking in transition as a guard running out so you're just losing value by putting him at center.  He needs a shooting big man like Lopez to play alongside him to really unlock him like Lopez did for Giannis.   Tho Embiid is basically an equally good shooter as Brook too and this was Simmons worst year...
"Bro, even centers are encouraged to take open jumpers these days. Baynes.. Jonas.. brook Lopez.  Like yeah there’s guy like capela and Drummond but they’re actual players who play the center position. It’s the only position that’s allowed a pass for not being able to shoot but even then you gotta bring something else to the table or you’re a scrub (Drummond). Capela brings defense and pnr   You need 4 shooters on the team and if your player who plays all positions from 1-4 can’t shoot, then you’re assed out. Theres elite shooters across 1-4. How many fans you see everyday saying he should shoot the ball?  You know for a fact doc def told him to take jumpers too. Why you think he said he ain’t know if he chanpsionship caliber player"
"Lillard isn’t nearly the same passer, Bucks defense won’t be able to trap the PnR as much and the Hawks have better weapons. Plus Brook Lopez has to drop"
"Out of curiosity I ranked players by PPG to see how many have a negative AST/TO. The only players with negative ratios in the top 100 are:    Embiid - 2.8/3.1   MPJ - 1.1/1.3   John Collins - 1.2/1.3   Clint Capela - 0.8/1.2   DeAndre Ayton - 1.4/1.5   Rudy Gobert - 1.3/1.7   Darius Bazley - 1.8/2.2   Lauri Markannen - 0.9/1.0   Brook Lopez - 0.7/0.9    That’s the list. 91 other players are able to shoulder a scoring burden without having a negative ratio, regardless of their position or role in the offense.   The thing all these guys have in common? No handles. I think if Embiid wants to take another step towards being the most dominant player in the league has has to work on his handles and reading the defense when he’s double-teamed in the post."
He’d be nice at the four with a 5 that can space like Turner or Brook Lopez
"Whether they win the championship or not the Bucks should seriously consider Carlisle, Bud almost lost last round because he insisted on not letting Brook Lopez crash the offensive glass...KD and Blake Griffin were the Nets front court and it took until G5 or G6 for him to let Lopez(a great offensive rebounder) attack the glass.  Edit: say what you want about Carlisle rubbing people the wrong way he knows how to adjust a game plan"
"Thankfully, Brook Lopez is no Joel Embiid.  Different team, different players, we'll see how it plays out."
I mean Brook Lopez went from never shooting 3s to Splash Mountain. Ben's problem on top of being a bad shooter is he doesn't try to shoot. He can't improve if he never attempts shots in game.
"Brook Lopez could always shoot, he was a .800 FT shooter in Brooklyn before he started to tale 3s  What happened is that he probably always had the ability to knock down 3s, but was just never asked to do it"
"If Brook Lopez didn't get a brain freeze on the last Bucks inbound play, the ball woulda never reached KD."
"The Raptors didn't walk through anything, they went down 0-2 to Ersan Ilyasova and Brook Lopez and were a 2OT game away from being down 3-0. Winning the next 4 was very impressive but that series was not easy for them."
This guy was a fuckin VP of Basketball Operations lol. Unbelievable. Reminder that Magic let Brook Lopez fo who wanted to come back to the Lakers on an incredibly small deal. The guy has no idea how this stuff works. Great businessman. Great player. Horrid understanding of how to develop personnel.
"Portland would be a spacing nightmare w Simmons and nurkic on the floor though. He really needs to be paired with a big man that can shoot, like a Brook Lopez type big or like embiid (ha!)"
"I'll admit I was against it at the time, but not because I didn't appreciate Harden...I just thought our depth would be so gutted that we'd be a very high scoring losing team.  I underestimated several of our roleplayers and our general ability to defend *well enough* to win.  Plus Allen was my favorite, and after Brook Lopez was my favorite for years, I was loathe to lose yet another goofy fun nerdy center lol  In the end, the trade was great not only for getting Harden but for saving Levert's life, potentially."
"It’s sort of a bad example, Brook Lopez was always solid shooting those deep 2’s like Marc Gasol used to do.   Even back to Simmons’s pre-LSU days it was tough to find highlights of him shooting anything other than layups/dunks.  Edit: layups/dunks"
"I mean Brook Lopez developed a 3 point shot,  Ben should at least start dunking and we go from there"
"Meanwhile you got guys like Lonzo who worked hard on their shot, and even Brook Lopez worked on improving his outside shot. This guy has insane talent, but won’t work hard to improve himself."
"Lopez is actually still really good in the paint.  We didn't use him that way in the Net's series because we needed to space out due to the switching the Nets could use, but Brook would abuse Gallo if he gets the ball in the paint."
"It's weird, being a Nets fan I'd have thought I'd be crushed by a 2nd round exit. But considering the injuries, the way the team fought, and the closeness of the entire series, added with both NYK and PHI getting bounced by the Hawks, and I actually feel alright. Trae has been so fun to watch, I still love Brook Lopez, and CP3 has really come around on me the last couple years. I think only the Clippers would annoy me if they won but it's not like I'd be that upset."
"Even if he does, Lopez kinda sucks. I feel like Gallo could defend Brook"
"Bucks have home court and just as much momentum. People will continually be surprised by Brook Lopez on defense, drop coverage will be a concern with Trae but not nearly the same as KD exploiting it."
you'd have to put him at the 4 with a center who can spread the floor but isn't someone who needs to be on the block like embiid. Embiid is too good down tere to be a floor spreader.    So like... Myles Turner or Brook Lopez or something.   But is that really worth doing for Ben Simmons?
Again you are hoping they will all three  return to their prime. KD and Irving were out for a year. That’s time and Harden was trying to ride the bandwagon. Who’s getting rebounds when they miss? Seems Brook Lopez did alright.
"I agree OP. Brook Lopez had a J.R. Smith moment late in the game forgetting the shot clock and turning the ball over, nearly costing us the series against the Nets. But Bud post-game still immediately took the blame on himself which is how it should be.   You never wanna hurt your players confidence like that and personally it makes Doc look like a flip-flopper when he’s been speaking him up as an elite special talent all season."
"I disagree. Brook Lopez, Giannis, Capela, and Ayton still exist. The narrative works when teams like the Mavs lose and the Clippers win, but name me one NBA champion or finals team in the last ten years that didn’t have a big step up and play amazing defense."
We shall see my friend.   And although my head says the Suns…my heart says you guys should win. This is cause of Brook Lopez.
"To think, all of this could've been salvaged if he took that open dunk instead of passing it to a guy being guarded by 2 defenders. Lmao.  His brain was too occupied with missing free throws that he simply was blinded by the open dunk. Unbelievable.  Yesterday, Brook Lopez had a brain fart, but redeemed it with a block. Today, there was no such hope for Simmons."
"Well, how about in the playoff series the lack of adjustments, or failure to take advantage of your strengths over the opponent's weaknesses.  For one, Brook Lopez is a great post scorer, he has been his entire career. The Nets, throughout the series, were guarding him with either Kevin Durant, Jeff Green or Blake Griffin (Occasionally with Claxton), these players should all be food for Brook Lopez inside. To that point, if you go back and look through the games, Brook scored a lot of points whenever he caught the ball in the paint (Except very late in game  7). Why did Bud not set up some plays to take advantage of this size mismatch in the post to draw fouls &amp; score points, especially when the 3 point shooting was failing in games 1 &amp; 2?(Lopez had a great game in the paint, but none of it was from designed play)"
Brook Lopez own brooklyn now. Is the White women that Michael Che was talking about.
Bucks could have had him instead of taking Jabari Parker. He'd be pretty good in an expanded Brook Lopez role
friendly reminder that brook lopez had only 3 three pointers made when simmons entered the league. lopez has since made 630 three pointers while simmons has made 5.
"Bobby Portis or Brook Lopez are who come to mind. Bucks must be thinking the same way as you, with Giannis clogging the middle like Simmons would"
Absolute psychos. Didn’t see them crying about brook Lopez slapping the Nets logo for some reason
friendly reminder that brook lopez had only 3 three pointers made when simmons entered the league. lopez has since made 630 three pointers while simmons has made 5. there are no excuses for this guy
Durant? Nets? Middleton was the one helping to close out the game. Not Durant. Who won huh? Not Durant. Not Butler. Nope. Middleton &amp; Brook Lopez
imagine a team usa lineup of   trae young devin booker mikal bridges jae crowder brook lopez
Analytics tells people like Brook Lopez to shoot less midrange shots not Chris Paul. Enough with this stupid ass analytics talking point.
Who is the best American Big man? I mean AD comes to mind but he probably won’t do it cause of his health.  The next ones I can think of would be a Zeller or Plumlee brother.  Feels like every good center in the league is foreign. Maybe Brook Lopez?
"This will be the second time for Brooklyn.  Who can forget the superteam of Deron Williams, Joe Johnson, Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Brook Lopez and Gerald Wallace.  Hell Sean Marks just got them out of that hole the previous regime dug. But i don't blame him if you get the chance to have KD,Kyrie, and Harden you take it."
"i would agree with you if i had not witnessed r/nba hating on our young core before lebron joined our team. when we were just clarkson, kuzma, ingram, ball and randle, we still got soo much hate. r/nba even called brook lopez a flop artist and asshole player and are now pretending to have liked him all along now that he is in milwaukee. i understand the laker celtic rivalry, our two teams are the most winningest in nba history so we have a natural rivalry, but r/nba hates us when we are trash and when we are good, and while im cool with it, i dont understand it"
All assets Marks generated out of Brook Lopez and cap space - when we also had zero future
They also made brook Lopez look like SHAQ he was unstoppable in the paint de Andre Jordan would’ve helped
"Weirdly, other than that Brook had a pretty good game.  19 points, 4/7 from two, 3/4 from three.  2/2 free throws. 8 rebounds, 1 assists, 1 steal, 4 big blocks (at least 2 blocks on KD, which is almost impossible), +2 on the night.  I've been big on the ""play Giannas at center"" camp, but tonight Brook Lopez Belonged on the floor."
If the Bucks win the Finals I’m giving all credit to Brook Lopez. It’s what Warriors fans would want
He can drive okay he just lacks a floater. Brook Lopez drop coverage + Giannis coming in from behind is a layup no man's land unless you're Kyrie or something. Plus when Giannis was on him a contest from behind was a serious threat for a midrange shot. I think the bucks gameplan just really effectively shut him down.
Bucks should put Giannis on simmons and jrue on Seth   I think brook Lopez and Giannis can handle embiid. I imagine if the bucks play the 76ers Bobby Portis will get some run
"Because Lopez was guarding him, allows his guy to get space because Brook is so far back."
"Brook ""JR Smith"" Lopez"
"Was Brook Lopez supposed to alley-oop Giannis with 2 sec on the shot clock? Either way,  HORRIBLE play design regardless, Lopez can't catch and pass within 5 seconds."
"Completely agree, was considering making a post like this cuz I was a bit of hater. I respect how he knocked down his free throws the louder the countdowns became. He puts in a lot of heart everytime he decides to sprint like a madman into the paint and his finishes are downright impressive.  Also shoutout to brook lopez who was a beast on both ends that game. Had some big time plays at the end on defense"
Brook Lopez had enough of Durant’s sh¡t. Then he forgot how to basketball.  Then he remembered how to basketball.
"Back when I loved the Nets (Favors/Lopez iteration), I had hoped for Brook to be the next TD and Favors a budget Admiral. Happy to see both dudes still chugging along and being competitive."

I always love seeing Nets fans show Brook Lopez love. Dude plays a huge role for the Bucks and has such a hilarious personality. Plus I feel like he always has shown up in the playoffs for the Bucks.
"That was crazy. That made me say ""Brook Lopez is awesome"" out loud to myself when I was watching."
That and Brook Lopez had an incredible weak side block.
"Bad take, Brook Lopez only made one mistake the entire game other than him not shooting he was solid. Played well offensively (19 points on 7/11) and defensively (huge block on OT) could be argued he was the 2nd best player on the Bucks tonight"
"The Bucks play in slow motion. Like other than Giannis, you've got old man PJ, giant Brook Lopez, methodical Middleton, and plays in slow motion for some reason Jrue Holiday. How many of those guys are slashing? Maybe sometimes Middleton. Holiday surveys the court and looks for those openings, but he doesn't just put his head down too often and go.  This game, in particular, because the starters basically NEVER came out, it actually paid off in some ways. The Bucks still had some energy at the end."
Bud drew up a play to give it to brook Lopez in the corner with 2 seconds left lmaoo
 if brook Lopez didnt pull a Jr Smith and actually shot the ball this game wouldve been over. Or if the bucks came up with just one of those 200 rebounds on that prior nets posession the game would've been over. Bucks completely botched the last minute of that 4th quarter... I'm glad they were able to pull out the win but holy shit what a game
"He also took an ill advised third short after hitting those two shots, resulting in the block, and the Brook Lopez turnover.   Jrue is about as bad offensively as he is good defensively. Yes, he made some big shots, but he is horrible at running a team."
"Not really, the play sucked, it ended up w/ Brook lopez contested in the corner. Thats a failure on Buds part. The next out of bounds play sucked too. Why is this so hard for yall to understand?"
Let's not forget that Brook Lopez is the nets all time leading scorer and he did that to them on his former home court.
"Yeah looking back on that team through a basketball reference page and ignore all context sure that sounds like a lot of big names but Ginobili was a rookie who was 57th overall and played 20 mpg, he wasn’t Ginobili yet. Parker was a raw young point guard second year penultimate pick in the first round the year prior and would be benched for Speedy Claxton in the finals, not yet Tony Parker. David Robinson was on his final legs, could barely jump and averaged 8/8 and would retire after the season, far from MVP Admiral. Bruce Bowen was a great defender and shooter but he’s just a role player, not really a big name. And man Steve Smith and Malik Rose aren’t big names and I love Malik. Every Bud era Bucks team has had more help than this Spurs team, this was a one man team with a bunch of young guys and nice vets at the time. Jrue, Middleton, man even Brook Lopez could be the second best player on the 2003 Spurs"
Imagine if KD was an inch further back. This would forever be known as the Brook Lopez game.
Why in the hell would you inbound to Brook Lopez being plastered to the sideline for 3 with 2 seconds on the shot clock while Giannis would have been open in half a second with a wide open dunk at the rim.
Nets legend Brook Lopez!
"It's strange, he played 53 minutes but apparently wasn't capable of taking Brook Lopez off the dribble one on one, which is the kind of matchup he'd normally absolutely feast on."
Brook Lopez gonna have to change his name to Brooklyn Lopez after this game ￼
"Shout out to Brook ""Rim Protector"" Lopez for that clutch block"
"We are already choke artists, thank you very much. Idk why you're so salty though, if KD wears a size 13 instead of a 14 you literally would have choked because Brook Lopez, who is paid to play basketball, wasn't aware that there was 2 seconds on the shot clock after a full timeout. In a game 7. The shot they took for the win in regulation was a fadeaway from giannis that hit the shot clock. They scored 4 points in OT until the free throws at the very end. Come on bro"
"true but I think another thing would be instead of Lopez on help, it should be Giannis. Well, this game, Brook Lopez was excellent chasing down blocks on help, but in game 5, he got cooked. Just a little patch i would've like but it's Bud, he don't make adjustments.   Bucks won with heart and hustle"
Him and Brook Lopez balled out
Yea Lebron would’ve washed this squad by relentless attacking the paint that sports a Giannis/brook Lopez twin tower.
"The best player? LMAO because he got to play 1 on 1 with Brook Lopez, nah."
I was shitting on Brook Lopez but those blocks were crucial for the win
"Giannis airballed two free throws, Middleton &amp; Jrue played awful for most of the game, and Brook Lopez had a JR Smith moment: and they STILL won."
I can't wait for the brook Lopez volleyball meme to begin.
because brook lopez should not touch the ball with &lt;1min on the clock
Brook Lopez was 4 points away from being one of the most hated players in Bucks history
"At least Brook Lopez redeemed himself with the block after not shooting the ball as the clock run out, lol. Harden won't get a ring like this."
"Bud should be fired even if they win the championship (he wouldn’t be). They had 2 seconds in regulation to score and end the series. The most important play of his career to draw up and the chance to bust out his best play. He got brook Lopez in the deep corner with defenders near him. Sure brook clearly didn’t execute, but that’s just awful play calling."
"Brook lopez got his ass saved man, if Bucks lost he would be blamed for that loss and rightfully so with that late 4th qtr play. Worse than JR smith in the finals"
Brook Lopez is a Nets sleeper agent
Someone tell brook Lopez that he can’t let Trae shoot 10 foot floaters all game
Brook Lopez is the human embodiment of the word “Dorky”
Brook Lopez just giving up free points in the PnR once again FML
Brook Lopez runs like someone who just shit their pants
Brook Lopez Skywalker
Someone tell Brook Lopez to stop dropping off so low on the pick and roll
To have Brook Lopez start after all that he's shown is fireable alone.
"Can't decide who I want to win a ring more between Galo, Jae Crowder, and Brook Lopez"
Not to mention that C isn't C like it used to be. He's not in there banging with Mark Eaton. He's dealing with Brook Lopez shooting 3s.
brook lopez winning fmvp
yes. Brook Lopez is a rare stretch 5 while rudy is a traditional big. otherwise the bucks would've remained first round exits like they were before him
"&gt;Did I say that? Let’s say we end up with a Bucks / Suns finals. I feel much better about our chances with Ayton than KAT. Giannis and Lopez could give KAT trouble and limit him on offense whereas they would expose him on defense, both of them. Ayton can provide as an anchor on both of those guys and can guard both whereas I would consider KAT a liability   Yeah and KAT would force Brook Lopez out of the paint and disrupt the entire defensive scheme that the Bucks use. Not to mention that KAT isn't as awful of a defender that you paint him to be (you'd know that if you actually watched him)."
"You can deep dive into those stats but when Ayton was actually matched up with him those games and wasn't on Brook Lopez, Giannis struggled mightily."
"With the way Lopez has been playing big and not soft then he's going to be crucial against Ayton. Hawks only have Capela, but the Bucks have Giannis and Brook, plus Lopez also can tire him out on defense with his scoring. AD was the only one giving Ayton problems on both sides of the ball."
Bucks have a very favorable Match up against the suns.   They can throw giannis and Brook Lopez at Ayton.   Lopez at the 5 can force ayton to the perimeter..   Holiday and Middleton can definitly hold their own against chris Paul and Booker.  Suns have had it very easy   And now we see they are BARELY beating a clippers team missing kawhi.  This bucks team is almost full strength minus divenchenzo or w.e his name is.  I think the bucks will win.  I dont think the suns have enough size and defense to stop giannis.
That was mainly due to ayton guarding brook lopez so we had guys like mikal on giannis.  Mikal doesn't have the strength to bang with him in thr paing.
Brook Lopez aka ~ 2 rpg says hiiiiii
Yeah and that has nothing to do with acquiring Brook Lopez on of the better defensive centers in the league to anchor it that off-season.
People will dismiss this. But upgrading Thon Maker and John Henson to Brook Lopez is enormous.
"Giannis made the jump to MVP status in his last season with Kidd, go look at the stats, he was absolutely crushing dudes. You're basically saying Brook fucking Lopez was worth 16 extra wins and an insane difference in both offensive and defensive efficiency. I love Brook but you must think he's Steph Curry or something."
"I mean you can say I'm also blaming Lopez when I say that our deep drop coverage scheme against the Nets was a joke. It was not a good series for Brook, the rim protection he provides wasn't as important against that Nets team as our perimeter / PnR defense, he can't switch and he can't close out fast or chase players around.  But Lopez has been so good for us even when everybody else wasn't. Even in series we lost. Not sure how Bucks fans can blame him? It's easier to blame Khris or even Jrue than Lopez, he's almost never been bad."
No you see Brook lopez is actually worth 15+ wins
"Brook Lopez has been a top level defensive big the last 2 seasons. His rebound numbers are poor, so people assume he can’t defend."
I fr saw Brook Lopez guard Trae 1 on 1 into a shot clock violation. I couldn't believe it. Big man on the perimeter shut it down
"Brook Lopez feels like one of those players where, if you were GM and made it your sole objective, you could get him an all-star spot. Your team would be dogshit, but definitely feel like if you made a team with that goal and only that goal you could do it."
"Brook Lopez is like maybe the most underrated player in the league, hes such a good fit to giannis."
"I made a post about Bucks playing drop coverage some days ago if you care reading that - it's titled ""Giannis shouldn't guard KD"" or something, I think it sums up what was wrong with our defense in the Nets series and game 1 of the ECF.  Offensively, there's usually no ball movement. We did move the ball this game but usually you see Middleton ISO, Giannis ISO, Jrue ISO. It fucking sucks, especially when Khris who's our best ISO player is having a bad game. Also all 3 of them are very good passers and Lopez isn't terrible. There should be way better ball movement instead of what we're usually doing.   We also don't run PnR with Giannis rolling as much as we should. We did it in the 4th quarter last game and Giannis made 3 easy dunks. I fully expect Bud to stop doing it for some reason. We also don't utilize Brook down low, he's been so good there throughout his caree and we don't take advantage of that even when much shorter players guard him. We also rarely hunt mismatches, like Trae should be a defensive liability and I don't see us targeting him enough. Same with Harden last series.   Bud is not a good coach in the playoffs. He's lucky his team is more talented than anything we had to face so far. Even if we win it all this year, this team is playing much worse than most teams that won a ring last decade."
"Well Brook Lopez actually shows effort, KP looks like he's doing cardio and just here to clock in 9-5. That possession where Brook defended Trae on the perimeter and kept his hands active showed more urgency than KP did in the clippers series meanwhile watching Luka man the fort."
Brook Lopez has been an All Star in the past too.
He's been working on his three point shot and is already a good foul shooter for a true 5.  I think his ceiling is something similar to post-Nets Brook Lopez.  He's not a great shot blocker but he's young and mobile enough to still improve on the defensive end.  I think his best possible season would be something like 14/9 with 1.5 blocks.
"I want Cade Cunningham but the Bucks ain't getting #1, so then I want any Center because Brook Lopez is getting older that or a player that could fill that spot after the Eric Bledose Trade"
still trying to figure out how brook lopez is such a bad rebounder....
Brook Lopez better get 30 minutes at least when the games are closer.  No idea why him and Portis didn't play more in game 1. They seem so effective against the Hawks.
"I really think Trae will figure it out a bit and it's just a case of as a team coming up with contingencies, but in the moment there's definitely an element of panic where he was not expecting a 7'0 Brook Lopez to be forcing him to make a decision that quickly. There might be more going on that I just don't see, but I'm currently looking at it as a means of forcing Trae to make those pass-to-cutter/pass-to-corner/floater decisions *much* earlier in the play than he would like or is used to."
"Zion with the FIBA’s offensive gold tending rules has potential to be pretty crazy. The Manimal was surprisingly good at the 2014 worlds.      But I mean if they want a healthy American eligible big that can shoot threes, it’s basically him or brook Lopez. It’s a bummer KAT committed to the DR so early."
Brook Lopez saying F- you to all those that want him taken out so Bucks can play small ball.
"So the time I bet on Trae scoring and Capela rebounds, they have atrocious games and get blown out by 50 lmaooo. Brook Lopez finally learns how to rebound and score now. Just my luck. Running the same parlay back tho, this is the winner."
"Damn, Brook Lopez was responsible for pretty much everything in that run. The man was doing everything. Blocking shots, dunking, hitting threes. He deserves the game ball tonight."
hawks cant shoot for shit somehow and Brook fucking lopez had a hot hand hitting everything he shot
"Brook ""all-star"" Lopez"
Brook Lopez found a stash of secret stuff
I just watched trae get locked up by brook Lopez. Y'all done.
When did Brook Lopez turn into Wilt?
Brook Lopez turning into Wilt Chamberlain is an unexpected development.
Brook Lopez heard ya'll about the drop coverage
Brook Lopez doing it all.
"Noted Trae stopper, Brook Lopez."
Brook Lopez in unplayable                                        -r/nba
Well this is an all time turnaround from game one for Brook Lopez
Trae locked up by brook lopez
Brook Lopez with the CLAMPS on Ice Trae damn
Time to switch back to chucking 3s and dropping Brook Lopez next game.
Brook Lopez took that personally.
Wow but reddit coaches told me that you cannot play Brook Lopez or Bobby Portis
brook lopez is 7 feet with zero rebound how
They’re pressing the ball out of Trae’s hands which allows Brook Lopez to play drop coverage to his heart’s content
Has anyone else picked up that the same Portis/Collins interaction happened twice? And the brook lopez dunk then block sequence has happened again? Please tell me someone else has picked up on this.
Brook Lopez turning into Steph Curry was the nail in the coffin
Brook Lopez is dominating the Hawks on both ends
Brook 'PJ Tucker' Lopez
Trae really putting a bounty on Brook Lopez these couple runs
Yo wtf when did brook lopez add the 3 to his game 😅
Brook Lopez came to play today
"Brook Lopez is a fucking tree, yet I get surprised when he dunks."
i wasn't expecting a brook lopez poster in this series
Consider it a makeup call for Jrue fouling him every single second of every single play. Then calling it off of us when it was off Brook Lopez. Or not calling Giannis’s offensive fouls every time he’s in the post
How is brook lopez so good at shooting 3s
So glad I don’t have to root against Brook Lopez anymore 😢
"Nah we just watched him sit our 6th man for an entire half to play rookie Sterling Brown instead because (in his own words) he saw Sterling on the bench first, we watched him instruct Middleton to miss a FT on purpose while up 3 with 1 second left in a game, we watched our defence go from below average to literally the best in the league in one offseason without him with the only personnel change of note being known defensive juggernaut Brook Lopez.  It became Reddit gospel that Kidd is a bad coach because ‘somebody said something’ in the same way that it became Reddit gospel that Anthony Bennett was a draft bust because ‘somebody said something’."
"I mean, most big can shoot nowadays. Myles Turner? Brook Lopez?"
So adding brook lopez and George hill is the difference between the 8 seed and contention?
Brook lopez crippled their defense way harder than the small ball did when he was on the court
"An elite rim protector like Rudy Gobert, who just got absolutely exposed in the playoffs? A big guy who can’t space the floor and shoot doesn’t fit our system, no thanks. Now if Brook Lopez wanted to come home...."
Brook Lopez?
"This is the 2nd reply to specifically single out only this part of my comment, it feels like politics where the politicians pick the smallest snippet of an overall quote and make their entire argument over that without taking the rest of the context.  So on that note, let me take that part out and say for the record that KD was being mostly guarded by Brook Lopez. Do you still agree with the rest of my previous comment that I wouldn't trust Joe Harris, Landry Shamet, Bruce Brown, Jeff Green, and Blake Griffin to create their own shot against the rest of the Bucks? Given the situation, dropping 49 and 48 while playing the entire game is still a great game  KD is not a playmaker, so if that's the point you're trying to make, yes I agree with you. He's a pure scorer and a really really good one at that. He did a great job given the entire Nets situation, and I'm thankful for it as a Nets fan. The guy is not a perfect player in all offensive aspects but the effort was clearly there.   Things can be intersectional (for lack of a better word) and things can most definitely be situational without honing in on one specific shortcoming and then gravitating to an extreme based on that (recalling the strawman argument that politicians do). I encourage you as I did with the other reply to look at the majority of the comments and see how appreciative the fans are for Durant despite the cards the Nets were dealt with during the series"
"&gt; The fact that KD dropped 49 and 48 while playing the entire game and being the only focus on defense for Milwaukee as well as being guarded by PJ Tucker who has been regarded as ""the KD stopper"" going back years now, yeah that's insane  Maybe you didn't watch the games but KD was constantly getting put into pick and rolls with Brook Lopez who was dropping way back lol so no he wasn't being ""guarded"" by PJ Tucker."
"Over-rated, the snake was playing 1 on 1 with Brook Lopez lol It's not KD's fault but it's also not impressive"
Brook Lopez basically set up camp in the paint the entire series. Almost every other possession it was a 3 second violation. Him being allowed to camp did wonders against a team where the 2 stars aren't shooters
"Yup, Brook Lopez was abusing the fuck out of that rule in the Heat series. There were times he was in the paint for 10 seconds without guarding anyone"
Brook Lopez just sits in the paint lol
"OH. NO. HE. DIDNT. BROOK LOPEZ, WELCOME TO YOUR KODAK MOMENT"
Bud is a great regular season coach and Brook Lopez was a very valuable addition to them because it finally allowed Giannis to play in space.
It'd help if they had practice with it so they could realize that getting outrebounded just because you don't have Brook Lopez out there for the first time isn't a guaranteed outcome.
Brook Lopez is a legend.
"Brook Lopez is a pleasure to watch, even if he's not playing the best basketball"
"I am kinda pro screen, but I think today's 3 really should worth less than 3 point, extend that thing a feet and half and see who can really stroke it. The true shooters like Curry and Dame will still be hitting it, but the likes Marcus Morris or Brook Lopez will stop hitting them and gravitate back to the paint. If they don't, they will miss more and rebounding machines will return. And people like DeMar will have more room to operate their 1 on 1 artistry and be killing it, then you will need the true 1st team defense Tony Allen type to stop them.  I think I will have to stop myself here as I just jizzed in my pants."
Watch Brook Lopez. He'll spend entire possessions entirely in the paint guarding nobody with no call.
"I don’t necessarily agree with him being there but in the Olympics having a stretch big is pretty important. No defensive 3 seconds, goaltending, and it’s a smaller court. Slower pace too.   Now think of the stretch bigs. Embiid (not US), Jokic (not US), AD (out), Porzingis (not US), Kat (not US).  So who we rocking with? Probably Brook Lopez is the only other guy I can think of."
"Mike D’Antoni and Daryl Morey were far more responsible for the 3 point boom than Steph was, especially in terms of inspiring roleplayers (who make up 90% of the league) to shoot threes. Average players aren’t looking at Steph and thinking “yeah I can also be the best 3 point shooter ever” but they’re absolutely looking at guys like PJ Tucker and Brook Lopez extending their careers and remaining useful past their prime athletic years."
"He’s meant to destroy the bucks defense tbh.  Brook lopez on the floor with drop coverage, young will go to one of his favorite shots, those PNR floaters. They are so destructive bcuz if you drop too much, those floaters have a good chance of going in and if you step up he passes for the cutting big man. And credit to hawks setting up good screens. Holiday, one of the best at getting over them looks like he can’t fight through them well enough."
It’s him trying to improve. I will not fault him for that as long as he picks and chooses when to make in-game attempts. If he shoots them out of a game then it’s bad. If they are on pace for a win and he takes an open jumper then it’s worthwhile to the team for him to take those reps.  Also I don’t just assume a player is going to fail at evolving their games. We’ve seen guys like Bruce Bowen and Brook Lopez successfully adapt and add new weapons to their repertoire.  As long as he develops it smartly (ex. not forcing 10 three attempts/game) then I’m fine with it
"I think our real problem is attracting talent.  Post-Hibbert PG13 Pacers could have been great. Instead it was a team with Monta Ellis as the 2nd option  2015 FA (some were restricted I think):  Kawhi, Marc Gasol, Kevin Love, Aldridge, Jimmy Butler, Brook Lopez, Danny Green, Khris Middleton, Reggie Jackson (PG13's long time friend and aspiring teammate), Rondo   2016 FA: KD, Conley, Horford, Derozan, Whiteside, Howard, Batum, Beal, Barnes, Bazemore, Gasol, Jordan Clarkson, Eric Gordon     We also traded a first round pick and still landed on a lineup of:  Teague  Monta Ellis   Paul George  Thad Young  Myles Turner (20 y/o)  w/ either Lance Stephenson, CJ Miles, or Rodney Stuckey as our 6th man  --------------  This is why I don't harbor resentment towards PG13. He asked for help and we did fuck all. And, while I think that is more because the market than the FO, not every player can be expected to be Reggie and stick it out through thick and thin. He's from Cali, wants to win or play in Cali or both, fine. We don't offer winning, well, it's done for.   But I think our mediocrity has little to do with it. While the Hawks and Suns did fantastically tanking in our time since PG13 the Pistons, Knicks, Magic, Kings, and more have seen little reward for it."
Nurk actually has a pretty solid looking shot. I feel like he could make a Brook Lopez leap soon for perimeter shooting.
"Yea but rebounding is positional as well, that can be corrected and game planned  You cannot fix or adjust having Lopez being attacked in a PnR , even more so if you’re team hasn’t been practicing an alternative defense.  Boxing out is largely mental and discipline , you can’t make Brook faster laterally"
"It’s difficult to gauge.  Ex: Trae gets a screen from Capela. Trae’s defender, Jrue gets caught on the screen while Brook Lopez drops in coverage. Trae shoots the 3 and scores. Is this against Jrue or Brook?  Ex: Reggie Jackson drives by Clarkson to score at the rim. Next possession, Jackson drives by Clarkson again but Gobert is now at the rim waiting. Jackson kicks it out to Mann for 3. Mann scores. Is this against Gobert? Next possession… Jackson drives by Clarkson again, Gobert rotates over to stop the drive. Jackson kicks it out to Mann, but Royce ONeal rotates over. Mann swings it over to PG13 who knocks down the shot. Who is responsible for that score?  O’Neal starts realizing… that PG13 score is going to be on me because no one is rotating over. Screw it, I’m not going to rotate over to help Gobert so Mann will have to score 39 points in the game to beat us… and it’ll be all on Gobert."
"There aren’t many guards that can consistently make you pay for a drop coverage. It’s why the ‘drop’ bigs like Gobert and Brook Lopez are so successful in the regular season. But in the playoffs, against the top guards like Trae and Curry, you are cooked with those guys, your big gotta be mobile, or be an offensive threat to stay on the floor.   But Trae is such a good playmaker that if you press him, he’s almost always making the right read.   I think it’s a guard dependent thing with defending the pick and roll."
"As a neutral i think he was terrible game one. Rotations were really weird for one, first 3 quarters giannis would constantly get randomly subbed out and in, especially in the second i swear i saw giannis go in and out and back in about 4 times. You could chalk that up to foul trouble but to decide to pull him out but then put him back in with 2 min left seems indecisive.  Then theres the fact that he ran the jrue to giannis oop perfectly for multiple possessions after timeouts and everyone could see it was completely unstoppable as both of them were red hot that night, but on that pat play ran a play with jrue inbounding and kris as the focal point? Why not spam jrue giannis until the hawks figure it out? Why put the ball in the hands of kris to decide the game when hes damn near ice cold TWICE, when your co star jrue is having an absolute scorcher of a game.  USE YOUR CHALLENGE. IT IS FREE. There were like 3 chances to use it in the last 5 min, but he never used it. A big one i thought was traes and one floater. Replay showed he picked the ball up and threw it after the contact. Jrues hands were also straight up. Review had a good chance of changing it to a no call (less likely) or to a common foul before the shot. The fact he never challenged while the hawks were on a run and there were oppurtunities was baffling.  Then theres defence. Why insist on brook lopez drop coverage for 80% of the game. He. Is. Getting. Cooked. Trae dropped forty fucking eight off what seemed like endless floaters. And assisted on like 20 points off oops when lopez gets indecisive. I dont give a fuck that youre slightly smaller without brook, or that clint will crash offensively. Crash the fucking defensive boards with giannis at the 5. Dont play that shitty drop coverage. Try double teaming. What can be worse than allowing like 60 points from a single screen and roll action when brook is a traffic cone in that scheme. You can put multiple bodies and clint to box out, not the entire hawks team crashes. You cant let trae go at brook 30 times a game. The momentum created from all the oops and floaters is absolutely demoralising mentally as well.   Look i know the bucks have made it this far, but bud is absolutely getting outcoached. I dont want to get into the nets series but personally i think he was outcoached there as well."
I am brook lopez on the court
"To add onto this, when Lopez plays in drop coverage it means he's basically always in position to box out and help with the board.  When Giannis comes in and plays up on Trae, there's no one in position to rebound and the team around Giannis isn't going hard for the board.  I also don't think there's an easy way to solve this, but Bud needs to emphasis team rebounding when Brook is out. I know that isn't a ""solution"", but I definitely think it's a point of emphasis."
Good thing Brook Lopez was in.
"Positions now tend to be more about who you guard than what you do offensively.  He plays as a Power Forward defensively. He's not a primary rim protector the way Brook Lopez is.  But on offense, he also handles the ball a fair amount and plays from the top of the key a lot, which is different from most centers who tend to play lower in the post."
 Brook Lopez has had a surprisingly solid career. Good starter in the first half of his career and now a solid contributor in the latter half.   John Collin's ceiling might be higher but I'll be surprised if it is by much.  You  have to hope his upside is a better version of Julius Randle? Tobias Harris?  How many players make a leap after 4-5 years in the league? You kind of get what you get after years 2-3 especially when you start on a lottery team.. Only guy I recall making a leap from good player to superstar after year 4 is Kawhi. A large difference there is opportunity.   I dont have a horse in this race just looking at it objectively...I think lol.
Brook Lopez is about to dream shake Ayton to oblivion.
"You're right, it was great game. 23-15. His best game of the playoffs.   I recall Brook Lopez going off for one great game so I looked at his playoff numbers and was surprised how similar they were to John Collins.   Brook Lopez 13/6/1.8b on 57% shooting  John Collins 14/9/.6b on 55%  ."
Crossed Legs Brook Lopez
Same with Rick Mahorn and Brook Lopez. Two very different types of bigs
I think we would move Embiid into more of a brook lopez role on the perimeter and have Giannis play center it would probably keep him healthier and he would still be able to go off.
Why need Giannis when you have Brook '2k Hakeem' Lopez
Oh no. Not Brook Lopez. Just wait
"Brook Lopez: Wait, why no one buy me a gf when I played in BRK?"
"Brook Lopez, if he was literally any other team"
They said brook Lopez was an empty stats guy
Ben Simmons lmao. But seriously if he gets a jumpshot like how Blake Griffin and Brook Lopez did out of nowhere he will jump into being a top 5 player just like that lol. Probably not gonna happen.
"&gt; Not blindly sticking to the drop scheme, but incorporating way more switching, particularly in small-small actions. This absolutely destroyed the Bucks in last year's series against Miami, when they would mindlessly drop on even small-small actions and get burned repeatedly with the screener getting good looks &gt;   The reason Bucks stick to drop scheme is because it's been working for them, consistently being top defensive team every year under Bud  And it's due to personel, Brook Lopez is terrible at switching, Giannis is terrible at navigating screens and is way better on help defense  Also drop coverage has been better for them vs the Hawks than actually switching, i've pointed out this before the Hawks in the first 4 games actually scored less points per game with Trae Young healthy than in the last 2 when Bucks adopted the switching scheme   Hawks first four games, 104ppg Bucks playing drop coverage  Hawks last 2 games, crippled Trae Young as well, 109ppg with Bucks switching &gt;Not going under screens guarding Jimmy Butler (a poor off the dribble shooter) until they were on the verge of getting swept, and not letting Giannis guard him. They did both of those things in the rematch, putting size on him with Giannis/Tucker and going under on screens daring him to beat them with the jumper, and absolutely clamped Jimmy for the series.   Again, this goes to the same thing, it's personel and Giannis is not good at guarding other guards because he can't navigate screens, he's said that himself because of his size   &gt;Play your fucking core guys more minutes. Bud did absolutely mind-blowingly stupid things like playing Khris Middleton 33 minutes in a PLAYOFF game that he was +18 in but the Bucks lost by just 2 points.    https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/202009020MIL.html  You mean the game Middleton was in foul trouble? He had 3 fouls in the 2nd quarter, so again no point at all   &gt;They idiotically didn't run anywhere near enough PnR actions with Giannis as the roll man. Not from the top, not side PnRs, etc. You have one of the most devastating slashing forward who can murder teams as the roll man, and they did little to exploit this. They're running much more of Giannis as the roll man this year.   Giannis was used as a roll man in 2.3 possessions last season, he's being used as a rolle man 2.4 possessions this season, again you're completely wrong and basically no adjustment was made, you're just spewing bs  https://go.nba.com/hfdj  https://go.nba.com/qed8"
Brook Lopez  Bobby Portis  Guy on the bench who vaguely looks like Sisqo  Huge gap  Giannis  Booker  CP3
"I like this stat...  The Bucks were a plus-14 (scoring 126.6 points per 100 possessions) in Brook Lopez’s 64 minutes on the floor and were outscored by 16 points (scoring just 98.7 per 100) in his 37 minutes on the bench.  Suns need to figure out a way to play him off the floor via switches if they want to dramatically increase their chances of winning.   Since Lopez was the primary person guarding Ayton, it's the perfect opportunity for torching them in thy midrange or forcing switches on pick-and-roll with Chris Paul and Devin Booker if they continue to switch.  Early in the last series they were dropping in coverage instead of switching 1 through 5 on pick-and-rolls. I'm guessing they start with dropping (their strategy all year I believe) and maybe adjust the switching if that doesn't work."
"In the 2019 FIBA World Cup the US had a roster that had Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker, Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner and other NBA players coached by Gregg Popovich.  They didn't even make it to the Bronze game. They absolutely would not medal in the Olympics with those players."
"No he wasn't. A candidate means you have an actual realistic chance of winning it. Coming 10th while getting 4 third place votes doesn't make you an actual candidate. Saying Brook Lopez was a DPOY candidate last year is like saying Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook, Julius Randle and Derrick Rose were MVP candidates this year (all of whom received votes)"
We’ll probably try Jae on him first with DA camping around the paint. I have a feeling Brook Lopez is going to be getting a lot of open jumpers this series
"Jrue holiday is playing great but the biggest beneficiary has been Brook Lopez. Giannis gone has Free’d up all the space in the paint for him to work, playing like nets lopez the last couple games"
Why does giannis not play center? It feels like he and brook lopez don’t maximize each other playing together.
God could you imagine Luka with a centre like July 2021's Brook Lopez.
"Stats are great but also need context. Rebound rate/percentage is just the percentage of missed shots he rebounded while on the court. It doesn't take into account where or how he plays. Kawhi Leonard isn't a horrible rebounder but he has 9.9 percent rebound rate. Brook Lopez isn't a chump and he only has an 8.6. You can drop numbers all you want but without context they don't mean anything. PJ Tucker, who is a very good rebounder has 7.3, which is lower than Ojeleye. I guess PJ Tucker is a worse rebounder than him according to your stats.  Also rebound rate and percentage are the same thing, they aren't two separate categories lol."
"Brook Lopez is a great defender, he’s likely going to give DA some problems here and there"
are we gonna get another huge brook lopez game where he just dominates both ends and scores 30 points
"Obviously very little difference defensively between centres Drummond, Jokic, N/A, and Brook Lopez."
He was one brook Lopez brain fart from not having that long two point shot at all.
"Id rather the Suns win, but I'll settle for a Brook Lopez finals MVP and ring"
Brook lopez
"Cause this sub is just dumb as rocks. Calling it now, during the finals the Bucks are going to lose a game, there will be chants of ""Devin Booker top 5 player in the NBA"", ""Chris Paul best PG to ever play the game"", ""Budenholzer is a garbage coach"", then the Bucks will win a game and everyone will forget they said that and then say ""Middleton is the most underrated player in the NBA"", ""Giannis should have won MVP this year"", ""Brook Lopez is better than DeAndre Ayton"". All in all, a bunch of stupid moronic opinions depending on who won yesterday."
"That’s…a weird way of looking at things. Whether they won or lost is irrelevant to who’s more responsible for starting the trend.  Look at it this way. Do you seriously think coaches as well as the average roleplayer is coming into the league and thinking “yeah, I can shoot threes like Steph Curry so I’m gonna shoot them more”  Or, are they looking at guys like PJ Tucker and Brook Lopez extend their careers by learning how to shoot and thinking “I could probably learn to shoot at a respectable enough rate to make me a threat from deep and more valuable overall”?  Sure, maybe guys like Trae Young were influenced by Steph Curry but for 90% of the league they aren’t gonna look at Steph and think “that’s someone I think I can emulate”. It just doesn’t make sense logically."
"Personally, the Giannis-Ayton matchup in the post is too much work. The best tactic would be to attack the guard pair and force the rest of the team to win without them. If Giannis makes an effort to attack CP3 and Booker he'll have no less than a 6 inch height advantage everytime, and paired with defense from Holiday and Middleton will take a toll on those 2. Giannis will also be able to guard Ayton appropriately, Ayton has been incredible but the only defensive big of this caliber was AD who was injured during the first round. I don't think Giannis will be able to hold him perfectly, but he has the size and speed to keep up with him in a way that Jokic and Batum were not able to. It's also worth saying that putting Giannis at the 4 would be effective looking at potential match-ups of Dario Saric and Jae Crowder. Crowder is an elite defender who was able to put a dent in Lebron's production, but he will be giving up 5 inches of height, and cannot match Giannis' athletic ability.   On another note, P.J. Tucker will play a massive role on defense, he'll be able to guard 1-4 against this Phoenix team. With his performance against Kevin Durant, we can say with some certainty that he would be able to effectively guard someone like Booker, who is likely still feeling pain from his broken nose and who is the same size as P.J.  Some problems I see for the Bucks lie in the bench unit. Players like Brook Lopez, Bryn Forbes and Pat Connaughton may find themselves attacked by CP3's prodding offense. Taking advantage of Lopez's slow feet and lack of ability to close the distance on the mid range shot. This also applies to Booker, who will have the added benefit of size against Pat and Forbes. The Suns will likely be match-up hunting against this Milwaukee team and working to rotate the star defenders away from star offensive players. Defensively, I'm not sure what the Suns will be able to do. Bridges, Paul and Crowder are defensively diverse starters that can be swapped and changed around nearly interchangeably, so they will have an incredible amount of options to work through on the defensive end.   Ultimately, some key match-ups for this series will probably be  - Ayton vs Antetokounmpo   - Paul vs Holiday  - Booker vs Middleton  - Payne vs Teague  Especially without Giannis, Phoenix has an excellent opportunity to win this championship looking at the depth and versatility of their lineup. Barring injury, I expect Phoenix will take this series in 6-7 games."
"Yeah, I'd imagine he would be similar to a Brook Lopez / Marc Gasol player in today's game."
Game 6* my b. We saw Brook “Shaq” Lopez in Game 5
Definitely depends on if Bud still chooses to use his x-factor Brook Lopez once Giannis comes back. He hasn’t been when Giannis was on the floor before but hopefully this little stint of no Giannis will affect his game plan. I still expect a 10/20 game from Ayton for a couple games tho.
I mean maybe? That’s probably Joe Harris vs Brook lopez (feel free to correct me bucks fans). Harris was bad in the second series but still shot 40% total in the playoffs iirc.
Brook Lopez has been a madman as of late so we'll see
Brook Lopez finals MVP here we gooooo. bucks in 5.
"I will say I was surprised to see how good the Bucks are without Giannis. Ball movement was beautiful. Multiple guys attacking. Jrue somehow becoming an elite slasher. Middleton showing he deserves way more recognition as a ""No. 2"" guy. Brook Lopez deciding he was going to be a dominate scorer.  Those 5th and 6th games were so awesome"
And Brook Lopez plays like an all star.
Yeah man. Bud kept on playing Brook Lopez despite KD is hunting him in pick and roll. And Brook didn't even get any touches in the paint even though he was guarded by joe harris sometimes. Just infuriating
He also got Brook Lopez and Pat Connaughton mixed up numerous times lol
Giannis was a top 5 player in the league in Kidd’s last season and the Bucks went 44-38 and got bounced in round 1. They won 60 games immediately upon hiring the great Mike Budenholzer and lost a brutal ECF series to Toronto. Brook Lopez and like a half season of George Hill were the only notable additions to the team. 2 years later they’re clinching a finals berth coming off back to back wins in the ECF without Giannis. He’s a mighty fine coach.
"I think the problem is more Giannis makes things awkward on Lopez. So the gameplan then becomes using Lopez to stretch the D. BUT, Lopez doesn't, the D just treats him as a pick setting 3pt shooter. If Bud ran plays where they focused on Lopez in the post, then popped him out on other plays for Giannis to operate you'd see better consistency out of Middleton and Holiday. As it stands, that would entail making the game plan revolve around Brook, than your perennial MVP candidate."
Bobby Portis and Brook Lopez deserve a lot of credit too. The Bucks don't win this series without them.
"Unless the guy you're talking to is someone like, say, the person responsible for something like the BP oil spill, it would be pretty hard for your comment to be true.  Marv Albert is supposed to be the play-by-play guy.  The guy responsible for telling you who is doing what during that game.  Except, even sitting courtside, he can manage to confuse Pat Connaughton with *Brook Lopez*, or PJ Tucker with Khris Middleton (repeatedly).  Or call the name of a player who isn't on either team.  Or make up a name of a player who doesn't exist in the league.  Or say that a player on one team is in fact on the other team.  Or can't tell if a call is out of bounds or a foul, despite the referee clearly signaling what it is (and with the other call not making sense given what's going on on the floor while Marv is confused and talking).  Or can't tell if a shot is a three pointer even if the shooter is 2 feet inside the line.  I mean, it's literally the job of the play-by-play guy, and he's been incapable of doing it for many years now.  That makes him just about as bad at his job as someone can be."
"Not even just on the rebounding either, after Giannis went down, there was absolutely no excuses to let Brook Lopez play out of his mind in a must win game 5. It felt like any time the Bucks needed a basket Jrue would dish it down low to Lopez and he would bully his way through the paint with nor Hawks having no answer for him."
"What I'm saying is bud knows how to run a offense with standard nba guys.   Hell brook Lopez was looking like a god out there.  But he's repeatedly failed at designing an offense that works with giannis unique superstar talents, because that's not bog standard nba play. You have to get creative and Buds not that guy."
Brook Lopez +25
They didn’t even use brook Lopez properly a game after it worked and got him 30. I
"The most obvious example is Bud's refusal to use Lopez in the post against small lineups. He's tried it twice in the playoffs, half a game against the Hawks, and the 2nd quarter of a game against the Nets.  Brook absolutely dominated when given the opportunity. It makes no sense that Bud doesn't use it more often. It would really mess up the other teams rotations and potentially get players in foul trouble."
"Divincenzo barely played and was terrible as a rookie, Connaughton is an average role player, and I doubt Lopez would’ve turned into the floor spacer/defensive anchor he became without bud. To go from the 7th seed to the best team in the league with the addition of Brook Lopez is pretty impressive."
"The problem is that he wants to save the challenge for a call he thinks/knows is going to get reversed if he challenges. Like the trae call, middleton brushed him on the drive. Does an objective viewer think that'll get reversed? Of course. But middleton made contact, and refs hate reversing calls, so they'll just say ""nope he made contact, 2 shots."" You really have to have something be obvious when you challenge it, otherwise it's just throwing away a timeout. Even really obvious stuff frequently gets upheld.   Also he made great adjustments in the hawks series, not sure what that's talking about. He started the series in a fairly standard drop much like what philly ran to a fair degree of success lost a close game 1 that the bucks win if they can shoot at all, but trae looked a little too comfortable. made the adjustment for brook to come up higher and aggressive digs on screens in game 2, trae struggled immensely, blowout win.  Game 3 trae started going to a lot of pullup 3s as a counter and was hitting a ton, plus the team came out looking uninspired on the road, but middleton went off and the defense was still very good down the stretch to capture a win.  Game 4 bucks came out looking uninspired on the road again, but he chewed asses out at halftime, they came out looking like they were going to make a run and then giannis getting hurt absolutely took the air out of the team, got blown out on the road, low point of the series for milwaukee.   Game 5 he has to replace giannis in the starters, goes with bobby over a more obvious option like pat, and it works to perfection, brings a ton of energy and dominates the glass. Also has brook switching 1-5 and forcing the hawks into situations they can't attack the defense in, and then running down and sealing deep for easy buckets. Also attacked the weak poa D by the hawks with a ton of jrue/middleton + lopez middle pnrs that the hawks simply had no answer for.  Game 6 the hawks made an adjustment similar to what the bucks did in game 2, started digging down aggressively and really attacking middleton/jrue's space on those middle pnrs. The counter was that this created a lot of quality looks, particularly for tucker/others in the corner, but didn't fall in the first half. Switch everything scheme still worked great on D for the bucks, sluggish first half. Second half, middleton starts hitting his shots, Causes all kinds of problems for the hawks because now they're overcommitting to him, everyone gets in rhythm, bucks blow the game open. Players on the court got a little too conservative in the 4th, had a lull that almost cost them the lead, but jrue and a couple other guys came up with just enough to seal the win.   Didn't intend to write an oral history of bud's adjustments in the series, but I thought he made a lot of adjustments and overall very clearly won the scheme battle with mcmillan. This isn't every change he made but it is a summary of some of the big ones."
We all know brook Lopez is gonna win fmvp 😂
You don't watch games. His rotations are shit and he's lucky Brook Lopez of all people got hot in game 5
Well according to skip Brook Lopez is Wilt so probably harder than the clippers
Brook Lopez for head coach pls
Brook Lopez looking like his Nets all star self and Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday are doing WORK with the scoring load with Giannis out. Suns vs Bucks about to be a gooooood fucking series!
Brook lopez about to be bbq chicken. He can't sit his big head in the paint no more and do nothing.
"On June 18th, 2018, the Bucks signed Brook Lopez as their new Center, since that point, the Bucks have gone 162-65 in the regular season, 27-15 in the postseason, have 6 playoff series wins, and an NBA Finals appearance"
He was clearly talking about Brook Lopez.
&gt; Brook Lopez was “unplayable” after game 1 this series   according to who? Twitter?
Nope why would I think that? But bud makes dumbass decisions nonstop. Down vs the nets with 2 seconds left on the clock? Give it to brook Lopez in the corner baby
"Brook Lopez, kris Middleton and jrue holiday. What a fucking combo.. they should just swap k love for brook López in the us squad."
Brook Lopez
If Brook Lopez played like he did game 5 this wouldve been a blowout
Brook Lopez block in garbage time lmaooo
i need brook lopez to go get a ring
Hawks got sent home by middleton and brook lopez this series
I have severely underrated Brook Lopez
"werent people saying brook lopez cant guard trae, he looks like he's doing a good job of it tonight"
Brook Lopez pretty much just put the nail in the coffin.
That was the most Brook Lopez oop I could ever imagine.
Brook Wilt Lopez
Brook Lopez has a better vert than I thought
trae has brook lopez on him and just sits on the three point line. even after giving up the ball. the dude is clearly just not right at the moment
"i just want to see the bucks with a legit coach who gonna actually use brook lopez inside rather than just letting him space the floor all the time , people acting like lopez cant play inside with giannis on the court but thats pure bs"
Someone should remind the Bucks that they have Brook Lopez
2022: Brook Lopez  2023: Brook Lopez  2024: Brook Lopez  2025: Brook Lopez  2026: Brook Lopez  2027: Brook Lopez  2028: Brook Lopez  2029: Brook Lopez
Brook taking hookshots like he's Roping Lopez or something
capela is put into no win situations with having to defend brook lopez and jrue at the same time
"Brook Lopez better than Giannis, what a brilliant opinion man :/"
"This series has been so weird. Hawks win a game with no Trae/Giannis, Brook Lopez beats the Hawks, and now Bucks are going to win this with Trae playing but no Giannis."
He legitimately turns into a D-League player offensively when he’s asked to do something that doesn’t involve his HOF level talent point guard (be it harden trae or cp3)  He’s particularly bad when he has to play any center that’s more than just “good”; (AKA better than brook lopez)
Can the Bucks get Brook Lopez their best offensive player involved.  Batman* and Jrue about to have 20 turnovers among themselves.
Damn what happened to the Brook Lopez from the last game?
when do the hawks stop trying 3s over 7 foot brook lopez
Brook Lopez gonna win finals MVP isn't he
Brook Lopez and Chris Paul and Lou Williams say hi
What did they do with the real Brook Lopez
Did brook Lopez ask to be the man this week or what? Hes looking like he wants to drop another 30 bomb
"Bro who would've thought the final matchup of the ECF was gonne be Brook Lopez vs Danilo Gallinari, what is this 2013???"
Is Brook Lopez a HOF'er someday or nah?
Brook Lopez is the greatest offensive player I think of all time
How is Brook Lopez more athletic than Blake Griffin???
Brook Lopez is the best player in nba history
Brook Lopez is a three level scorer
Brook “automatic from anywhere” Lopez
Brook “the missing link” Lopez
So why hasn't Brook Lopez taken a single shot after dominating them in game 5?
Brook Lopez needs to just stop shooting. As much as I love Giannis single handedly do everything let's give him some help. He's ppaying 1v9.
Good pass Brook Lopez.
imagine getting crossed by Brook Lopez
I totally forgot Brook Lopez was on the Bucs
Brook Lopez takes that easy
Prolly have Brook Lopez come off the bench
If anything Brook Lopez plays more like an old school center with a 3 point stroke. Nothing old school about Deandre's game
"Donovan Mitchell, Derrick White, Kemba Walker, Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, Mason Plumlee, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Harrison Barnes, Marcus Smart, and Joe Harris.  Not the best team we could have sent, but they definitely should have finished better than 7th."
"Probably worse? Bruh it’s obviously worse. That team had joe Harris, Derrick white, Marcus smart, Harrison barnes, mason plumlee, kemba, Myles turner, and brook lopez. The only players on that team that are on the level of any player on this team were Mitchell, tatum, brown, and Middleton"
"Lowry is a great 3rd and 2nd option guy, he would constantly switch back and forth with Pascal siakim. Unfortunately for the bucks Jrue and Khris are constantly fighting for the 4th option guy behind Brook Lopez and Pat/PJ"
"Myles Turner, Brook Lopez or Jarrett Allen. That's the best I can do."
Fuck I have not payed attention to Brook Lopez the last few years
“Imagine being that big and doing nothing but shoot jumpers and play no defense.”  We already have Brook Lopez
1. Giannis Antetokounmpo  2. Devin Booker  3. Chris Paul  4. Khris Middleton  5. Jrue Holiday  6. De’Andre Ayton  7. Mikal Bridges  8. Brook Lopez  9. Jae Crowder  10. Pat Connaughton  11. Cameron Payne  12. PJ Tucker
"I don’t watch ESPN at all or even have cable but I feel what you just described watching the Bucks. It took the Nets not having 2 of their 4 best players and one of their MVP’s being completely immobile to beat them in an OT game 7.  Who would the Bucks have beaten in the West this year besides Memphis? Their offense is “random” in the worst way possible and so is their consistency. The defense seems to hinge on if Brook Lopez is an asset or liability for any given matchup.  Giannis is amazing but their team as a whole is pretty infuriating to watch. As far as “beautiful basketball” goes, They’re basically the polar opposite of the pre KD Warriors. The whole East sucked without the Nets being healthy so it’s not their fault for winning, but it is still annoying seeing a team playing nowhere close to their perceived potential and winning anyway because their opponents keep getting injured"
When I read the first part of this post I was legitimately angry that someone was stupid enough to ask if Brook Lopez was headed to the hall of fame. It shouldn’t matter but I was offended at the shear audacity of the level of stupidity it would take to believe that.
"They should call Brook Lopez “Blopez”, pronounced Blowpez. We’ve been missing years of such an iconic nickname"
Didn't Lopez get traded to the Bulls and the coach said he was happy to be getting Brook Lopez and everyone was like....you got Robin.
Robin Lopez is gonna make the HOF for starting on a playoff team more than once. Brook Lopez is basically a lock because he went to an All-Star game *and* played in the Finals.
"Well, Robin Lopez has never averaged more than 11 points per game, so Brook did most of the heavy lifting here with 19-20 ppg in a bunch of seasons. Brook was legitimately a fringe all-star for a good part of his career, and an actual all-star in 2013. Robin has generally been a depth piece, starting some seasons but never a focal point of the offense like Brook was for the Nets."
"Robin Lopez is going to make the HOF by himself for just being a generally cool dude, so yeah I guess a fusion of him and Brook would make it too."
Myles Turner is a better defender than Brook Lopez and Kevin Love.
Imagine if the next game Brook Lopez CATCHES FIRE! Like a PHOENIX!
Alot of players still develop a solid if not average jumpshot even very late into their careers. See brook lopez
"&gt;Most people weren't saying the bucks would've won't only that the officiating was bad.  Never said that people said the Bucks would have won, but a lot of people claimed that the game would have been ""essentially"" tied, which is not how it works.    &gt;And yes what do u have an issue with about the side by sides? That seems to be correct.  I'll bite at this low quality bait. Holiday made a non-basketball move to initiate contact with a defender who; had landed by him without causing contact before, had his back to him, and had his arm down. Meanwhile in the Booker plays, one hit Booker on the elbow which is a foul 1000/10 times. And the second was Brook Lopez **literally** jumping into Booker's space with his arm extended forward. And before Lopez could land and reestablish himself, Booker went up with a shot. Which is also a foul 1000/10 times."
"Okay, Jrue is absolutely shitting the bed in the playoffs right now but I don't understand why people keep calling him an all-star. He was, once, in 2013 - the same year as Brook Lopez. It's not like he's been close in voting; I can't even find numbers for him for fan votes this year - but at best he's behind Fred VanVleet. Jeff Teague has a more recent all-star appearance than him! Jeff Teague!"
"Kyrie wanted out, they thought IT would bounce back and that pick could have easily turned into Ayton, Young, Doncic, or SGA.   The Nets the year before had the worst record in the league and had not won a game brook lopez didn’t play in in I believe the previous two season. When the worst team in the league trades their best player it’s surprising for that pick to fall to 8."
Why would the lakers want brook lopez for that much money
"Yeah very blessed to have no rings, very blessed to have brook lopez as your franchise leading scorer. Very blessed to not make the finals in 19 years . Such a blessed franchise man"
"THIS. At best they make one pass on the perimeter off a screen, at worst it’s ISO prayers. Anyone else see when Paul switched onto Lopez and Giannis jacked up a 3 while Brook ran to the far side corner?"
Brook Lopez is still their best half court scorer
"32% from the field for Middleton + Holiday.  Getting in the hole 12/15 points and the best you have to show for it is cutting it to 6 is awful and embarrassing as a finals team. I know the Bucks are going home but it feels like they may not even win 1 game.  Bud sucks ass. Straight up.  Why TF is Middleton EVER guarding Booker. There was a stretch where Booker might of had 11 straight points on him. Giannis or Tucker, anybody else is useless...Also, Brook Lopez might be the worst pick n roll defender in the league besides Kanter. I'd rather bench his ass and get Portis out there who can actually move or hedge....Lopez literally just sits 15 feet off and waddles his goofy ass in the paint in no-mans-land.  I'm not even a Bucks fan but damn they are just frustrating to watch. But hats off to PHX for having something to do with that."
"I looked at that line and said “nah, I’ll bet Brook Lopez over 18 points/rebounds/assists instead” lol"
"“Loaded with talent?”  Middleton is good but wildly inconsistent, which the Bucks were on the wrong side of tonight. Jrue at this point is pretty much a good passer and good defender, when they really need him to be a good scorer when Middleton is playing poorly. After that? I don’t know. Brook Lopez is a great stretch 5, but the Bucks play better against the Suns with Giannis at 5."
"I agree he’s slept on, but if you want to talk about the MOST underrated players in the league, Brook Lopez is in the discussion for top 3. (Ironic because Middleton is top 3 overrated IMO) He shoots, spreads the floor, provides decent help defense on the perimeter and has developed into one of the leagues best post defenders.. I guess he is 32 so he’s got 3 years max left at this clip tho"
"The best scenario for the Bucks is that Jrue becomes better acclimated with the team in his second year and finds an offense to match with the great defense, Lopez becomes a 6th man rotating for Giannis at the 5 (Brook is getting older and the double bigs isn't working), and Middleton becomes his average each night, rather than the up and down player he is right now. Other than that, there's not much out there for them. No real draft picks or much opportunity to bring in new assets. They've got to hope they can even keep Portis, and he may end up a starter alongside Giannis, Khris, Jrue, and Pat/Dante."
Bucks got the calls their way like it’s a home game tonight. Other than that Cam Payne Brook Lopez ones every other tic tac foul send Bucks to the FT line
"I'm so salty man. We had to play against the Payton, Kobe, and Shaq Bucks, except against us Shaq was Brook Lopez."
Pat Connaughton is getting abused on defense.  Khris Middleton is doing his fan favorite houdini act  Jrue Holiday has become Eric Bledsoe.  Brook Lopez has reverted back into Brook Lopez after looking like prime Kareem in against the Hawks.  It's a damn shame.
"People need to chill on the Giannis is being wasted takes… the Bucks have done about as good as you can as a small market team surrounding him with talent.  Middleton and Holiday while streaky at times are two great two way players, Brook Lopez can be dominant depending on matchup, they have 3 point specialists, they have defensive specialists… Bud’s rotations are entirely too strict and tight though."
Brook Lopez played awesome defense all game and yet they go to PJ Tucker
How you get your ass beat by slow ass 7 foot Brook lopez lol
Brook Lopez is doing what I asked about as far as refusing to switch on the pick'n'roll sometimes... gamble and see what happens.
He charged to brook lopez meanwhile Lopez was tryna contest
Did you not see Cameron Payne run into brook Lopez and brook Lopez get a foul call??!
Brook Lopez moves like I did after the time I took a CrossFit class
Brook Lopez *exists*  Ref: that's a foul
WAIT HOW IS THAT A FOUL ON BROOK LOPEZ LMAO
"You're reading it too literally. They aren't literally writing the rulebook out themselves, they aren't getting paid by the NBA to write the rules out, so for you to take their suggestion as the literal written rule is absurdly over the top. If you want to participate in the discussion, you have to meet them in the middle and use some rationality to understand the concept of what they're explaining.  The literal meaning isn't to say that all contact is a foul and whoever initiates contact is the one committing the foul. The wording would likely involve something about excessive contact or something along those lines.   The concept, or idea being expressed, as it would pertain to the example you provided would go as follows.  Brook Lopez puts his foot on a space on the floor. Chris Paul puts his foot on top of Brook Lopez's foot. Was it excessive contact, did it make Brook Lopez trip and fall or have potential to seriously injure him etc.? Did Chris Paul jump first, and then Brook Lopez put his foot in the landing space? The rule would obviously encompass landing space as part of the ""owning"" space on the court. If Chris Paul jumps first, then he owns what would be considered the landing space. If Brook Lopez was already in the landing space before Chris Paul jumps, then it's still Brook Lopez's space. That's the intent of the suggested rule change, to prevent these offensive players from jumping into defensive players and other similar moves. Currently the idea of landing space doesn't even apply to defensive players seemingly, because the NBA doesn't call it that way. The idea that if a defender holds their hand out and the offensive players sweeps their arms into the defender also doesn't give the defender credit for owning space either."
"Does bud even have a playbook, he’s taking play random to the extreme, where’s those money lobs to Brook Lopez we saw against the hawks ?"
On that one Brook Lopez got underneath him.  Lopez actually is a pretty reckless closer he's done that few times this playoffs. That one should've been a foul looked like Crowder rolled his ankle
"So Brook Lopez doesn't even jump or raise his hands when defending in the paint, eh?"
Brook Lopez still the worst putback big in the league
"Seriously. If anyone's the Dollar Tree version of Steph, it's Brook Lopez since he's just one buck."
"So if Brook Lopez puts his foot on a space on the floor, and Chris Paul puts *his* foot on top of where Lopez already owns the space, it's a foul on Paul?"
"yeah, but Tatum turned his ankle and didn't finish out the tourney, also frankly I like this team much better than the 2019 roster.  A good chunk of that roster is significantly below this squad (Plumlee, Harris, Smart, Barnes, Myles Turner for sure and also Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Kemba &amp; Derrick White)"
"""clearly don't support their narrative""  I mean, you had to take get a screenshot of the replay to prove to people that the call was technically correct. I think that's part of the point bucks fans are making. All these close calls that the suns got in game one generally didn't go both ways. If the bucks got a few of the calls that they probably should have, the fans wouldn't be complaining so much about these types of plays. More of the complaining would be about stuff like Brook Lopez in the PnR or jrue shooting like ass again"
"Brook Lopez used to be a first option franchise player, he could lean on that experience. Comparing kuzma to current Lopez is not a fair assessment."
Brook lopez would like a word
Some of the people you mentioned aren’t even All-Stars. A superstar isn’t a just talented player. Its about level of greatness and fame. Middleton is good but he ain’t Lebron/Durant/Harden/Steph level.   You don’t pick names out of a lineup. You pick faces. People that watch under 20 NBA games a year know what Steph Curry looks like. People can watch a full season and not know remember what Holiday looks like. Or could tell the difference between Brook and Robin Lopez.
"Listed heights and weights are meaningless in the NBA. KD is listed as 6'10"" but he is actually about half an inch shorter than Brook Lopez. When they stand next to each other Giannis has at least 2 inches on Simmons and is so much more jacked.  My point is not that Seth Curry is as good as Steph or that Khris is as good as KD. That would be as stupid as saying Ben Simmons is as good as Giannis. Each pair of players I mentioned have similar playstyles, just one the two are FAR better than the other.  Giannis is the most dominant interior scorer since Shaq and has averaged about double the points and rebounds of Simmons over the last 3 years on about 2.5 fewer assists.  Like I keep saying, you're not getting paid for your hot takes so you just look fucking stupid."
"Or you know, invite brook lopez for his defense"
"We're trying to adjust for the fact that these are all first-option centers and Ayton is a 3rd year center under Book and CP3. You've seen even in these playoff runs he's not getting quite a lot of touches, but the shots he does take are high %. He held up well against Jokic, the laker's size, and Zubac, and you saw what the Suns did to Brook Lopez/Giannis. There's no vacuum to really look at this in, but I'd rather have Ayton on my team than Capela, Gobert, or even Bam."
"in my opinion, not too bad. brook lopez is okay, but better than kaminsky, so that’s bad for the suns. however, just pray and switch lopez onto booker or cp3 and you’ll be straight"
Brook Lopez
"If u can’t remember the last time someone posted up back 2 basket then u must not watch, LeBron, Jokic, Embiid, Sabonis, Randle, Brook Lopez, Vuc play"
Dirk.   Lmao.  Great player.  Amazing.  But not sure a lot of guys at that size have that skill set.  He’s more of a unicorn than than an influencer.   Maybe KP plays that way.  Maybe Durant but he has 10x the physical gifts.  I think about it more as Brook Lopez plays that way but he’s still brook looez
Brook Lopez scored more points in the paint in game 5 (without Giannis) than he did that entire series. Bud has regulated Lopez to a stretch 5 pretty much his entire tenure with Mil
Milwaukee doesn't have a big can dominate in the paint? Did you see what Brook Lopez did to the Hawks last series?
"There is a huge difference between being a reluctant shooter and a bad shooter.  Brook Lopez didn't attempt more than 2 threes in a season until his 7th year in the league, but he's always been a good shooter. He is a career 80% FT shooter, whose worst FT% season was an anomaly based off an injury-shortened 5 game sample size, and that was still better than Adams' best ever season from the charity stripe.  Lopez made a huge change to his game, yes, but he was working from a strong fundamental base. Adams is just a bad shooter.  I'm pretty confident in saying that Adams will never have a transformation like Lopez."
"I think people are overrating Saric’s importance for this series specifically. Wing defenders are more important against the Bucks than bigs, especially since 5 rebounds is considered a good day for Brook Lopez.   He’ll definitely be missed and Kaminsky is ass, but the Suns could run small ball and not really miss a beat."
The excruciating cruciate ligament tear of Dario Saric by the coward Brook Lopez.  And Lopez took out Chris Paul's ankle with a flagrant foul later in the game as well. Paul tweaked it but luckily was able to resume play.
"“Led in every statistical category”?  Dude the box score was very even other than you guys didn’t hit your free throws.  You outrebounded us by 4, but you also had 4 more turnovers. We had 2 more points in the paint. We had 3 fewer assists but we also had a commanding lead for most of the 2nd half which led to a lot of slow iso ball (not conducive to assists).  You are totally splitting hairs if you’re looking at the box score and your conclusion is “oh the Bucks outplayed the Suns!” That’s ridiculous.   It was a pretty even game where the Suns won because they attacked the Brook Lopez switches and got to the hole slightly better than the Bucks in the first 3 quarters, then held on to the lead by slowing the game down."
deadass. the responses to the post I replied to were crazy. they're taking brook Lopez over kevin when just their stats are  brook in his 3 postseasons in milwaukee: 13/6/1 on 34.8% from deep  love in his 3 deep postseasons (was hurt in one of them): 15/10/2 on 40.2% from deep
"Yeah, he was somebody you had to account for defensively. Kevin Love absolutely abused CJ Miles in the post on repeated possessions that one year. The Cavs were not afraid to exploit his mismatches.  Meanwhile, you've got teams hiding guys like Bruce Brown on Lopez for extended stretches and getting away with it. Some of it can be blamed on coaching, or lack of aggression from Brook, or the continued evolution of the game away from postups (i.e., refs let you hack Brook in the post but will reward Khris for jumping into his defender at the 3pt line)... but you've also got to give Kevin Love some respect.   He can dribble the ball while backing down (and pass out of the post if it's not there) much better than Brook."
I mean Giannis is always guarded like that 2 players forward and 1 camping the paint. Brook Lopez stayed in the paint the whole heat serie as well. That rule is not endorced at all
"I'd see about giving Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, John Collins, or Christian Wood a run"
Brook Lopez
"Suns found a way to get Lopez off the floor with making him defend CP and Book.  But otherwise, Brook was eating Kaminsky"
This dude is probably one of the biggest complainers I’ve ever seen on Reddit. Straight up no life complaining all fucking day about calls when he should be focused on Brook Lopez switching onto guards.
"&gt;They gave Chris Paul free throws when he just ran into somebody.  Yes he did, that foul was on Giannis and he was trailing behind to try and block the shot.  &gt;Booker got a bunch of get the guy in the air and jump into them(even though the defender had landed several times before the contact).  That happened twice and they were still in the air actually. I remember because one was on Brook Lopez and he hadn't landed yet.  &gt;The Bucks attempted more shots in the paint than the Suns. So miss me with that aggressive BS.  Jump shots and tip ins=/=aggressive. Drives to the paint are more likely to get you those free throws than trying to tip the ball in or taking a jumpshot just inside the paint."
"Adding a three really helped Brook Lopez and Bosh later in their careers, good to see Adams is adjusting his game"
FT disparity lol. Maybe the Bucks should stop fouling? Maybe the Bucks should drive to the paint more? You know why Giannis is the only person that took FTs for the Bucks? Because he was the only one driving to the paint. Brook Lopez took FTs too and missed all of them.   Bucks foul the mid range shots too much because they know they'll drop.   Rigged? Wouldn't the fix be in on the underdog?   Suns hooped. Most Bucks fans realize Jrue Holiday lost the game because their big 3 can never get hot at the same time.
"I remember Booker getting one call with light contact.   Do you not think Giannis gets the same number of soft fouls when he creates most of the contact with his left forearm and shoulder? I do. Not as egregious as Paul George but he has been getting that call consistently.  But there is no way you could have watched that game and thought 1. The teams were equally aggressive (because they weren’t), and 2. That the Bucks got into, and exploited, mismatches as well as the Suns did. Our pick and roll was constantly opening up driving lanes dude. Maybe that will change if you guys sit Brook Lopez and go small."
"I'm saying there was no answer to the Suns last night. They *tried* to make adjustments and it didn't work.  The issues the Bucks have are roster mismatches. Brook Lopez can't stay on the floor because he can't defend the perimeter like Ayton. If Jrue isn't playing well their entire defense can get shredded.  They weren't able to find any matchup that effectively defended the high PnR.  They'll try more things, they have to. But nothing they tried last night showed any glimpse of success.  The only time they cut the lead down to 7 Booker &amp; Ayton were off the court - so you can't really rely on that.  I'm sure they're going to try Giannis at the 5.  It might help, but idk how much that really helps, having your guy coming off an injury have to put in a lot of effort on the defensive end against Ayton.  I don't see a path to winning it all for Milwaukee outside of Giannis going nuclear like KD in the Bucks/Nets series."
The refs didn’t lose the Bucks the game. Bud not adjusting in the third when CP3 and Book were hunting Brook Lopez and Bobby Portis every possession. They almost came back in the 4th because Bud realized he couldn’t play Bobby or Brook and put Giannis in at the 5
Tell that to Brook Lopez.
Even guys like Brook Lopez are expected to hit threes and switch on the perimeter. Today’s “shit” center has a much bigger skill set. Dude Utah couldn’t even play their DPOY center in the playoffs! You think Felton Spencer would see playoff minutes?
Brook Lopez taking more shots than Giannis is not the recipe for a finals victory.
How do people believe this shit. Brook Lopez is not trying to injure Chris Paul in the fucking finals.
"You had Forbes, Giannis, Jrue, Middleton, &amp; Connaughton  The Suns had Payne, CP3, Cam Johnson, Crowder, Craig  You guys didn't technically have your starting 5 because Brook Lopez was banished to the shadow realm, but you had your big 3 in against the Suns bench mob &amp; CP3... the matchup was heavily in your favor and it showed."
If you really think brook lopez is trying to hurt somebody there is something wrong with you.
"""Final Moments"" lol Jrue and Giannis went to the line within the first like 3 minutes of the quarter. They were in the bonus 4 minutes into the 4th quarter.  The Suns had more free throw attempts because the Bucks weren't attacking the rim. They were playing small ball and shooting 3s. Even brook Lopez was.  Blaming the refs when your team lost by 13 and was down 20 at one point is fucking stupid. Just take the L dude."
"No, the bucks weren't attacking the rim. Giannis didn't get aggressive until the 4th (which makes sense because of his injury), but nobody else.  Brook lopez was played off the floor and made almost half his shots from 3.    They just weren't attacking the paint. They were playing aggressive so they weren't going to get the calls."
You can get replacement rim protectors for much cheaper who can give you much more offensively. Players like Brook Lopez.
Not even mad about Dwight - it's Brook Lopez that seems like the really bad one.
"People still stanning for a lumbering 7 foot rim protector in 2021? Gobert would have an aneurysm making some of the plays Ayton was making.   Y’all are watching Brook Lopez, a good rim protector and legitimate offensive threat become a liability and still wondering about Gobert?   Brook has all-defensive guards in front of him but CP3  and Book are killing them whether they play a drop or switch.   I’m sorry Gobert is nowhere near the elite bigs and it shouldn’t even be a debate anymore."
"Pretty much all of CP3s first half points were because of Lopez switches.   The whole point of a drop is giving up midrange. Brook would try to step up but he isn't mobile enough. So either he gets blown by and CP3 gets a layup/lob, or the Bucks concede for a switch.   The only other thing they can do is bring someone else to cover the lob which leaves another person open. And the Suns have been very good at moving the ball to that man.   Basically Lopez has to survive himself. He gives up midrange because he has to."
Brook Lopez should be credited for like 16 of these points
Soo for brook lopez his is minus 17 is it cuz 17 times they scored points on him whether that’s cp3 or booker or Ayton
"Siakham and Brook Lopez to the Warriors, Wiseman and picks to the Raptors, Wiggins to the Bucks.   Finally unite Brook with his splash bros."
"I had the pleasure of meeting Brook Lopez in line for space Mountain a few years ago, and if Lopez rode a ride where I (5’10”) am cramped, he’ll be ok"
"Kevin Love literally was not an all-star when the Cavs won. By what definition was he a star player in 2016?  &gt;I never said it has to be ""superstars"" I was making fun of you trying to use Bobby Portis and Brook Lopez as your examples  You're making fun of yourself because it is YOUR definition of superteam that makes these trades/free agents part of the formation of a superteam.  Also another change from ""superstar"" to ""star"". You ever gonna figure out what you're talking about?"
"I never said it has to be ""superstars"" I was making fun of you trying to use Bobby Portis and Brook Lopez as your examples   And if you don't think Kevin Love was a star player at the time, then you are new to watching basketball and didn't see him on the T Wolves"
"I mean, we have no idea, he could be a Brook Lopez/Marc Gasol-type that actually turns out decent. It's not like he's been an actively poor 3-point shooter to this point, he's straight-up not attempted them."
Good for Steven. Adopt those Brook Lopez methods to extend your career
Brook Lopez was a strong FT shooter and good mid range shooter he had a bunch of indicators he could successfully make the transition to bombing from 3 that Adams doesnt have. Adams is also a considerably better offensive rebounder than Brook was even when he was younger and didnt take 3s in BKN
Brook Lopez came into the league talented offensively
They did for a year or 2 of Brook Lopez
I mean people can clown on this if they want but it wouldn’t be any more ridiculous than brook lopez turning into a shooter
"If you put him next to Luka and got them a stretch 5 like Brook Lopez, I think they’d be championship contenders and Ben would be the second best player. I’d also love to see Ben next to KAT and D’Lo in Minny. It’s hard to build a team around Ben, but if you surround him by shooters like Giannis was but make him the 2nd star next to an MVP caliber guy, I think that’s a contender"
"Sure, but if we're mapping this year's Bucks to 2011 Mavs, the analogue to Marion is Middleton. JTerry vs. Holiday. Kidd/Barea/Deshawn Stevenson vs. Tucker/Connaughton. Tyson Chandler vs. Brook Lopez/Portis.    Pretty clear Giannis had the better supporting cast offensively. Defensively, it's closer and more edge to Mavs probably."
"&gt; If you want to shit on Kidd go ahead, but don't be brainless and going around spewing shit just because you hate him  Talk about brainless. Before that season Lopez was seen as washed, but go ahead. This alcoholic trashcan was fired with a 23-22 record, Prunty took over amd the Bucks went 21-16 (much better than any Kidd team) then took off with Bud.  18th defense to no.1 all by adding Brook “best defender of all time” Lopez. Negative NetRtg to league-best. Hope you’re on Cuban’s payroll. It’d be sad if you do it for free."
"Beat a bad Heat team.  Was on their way to being swept by the Nets before Kyrie hurt his ankle when he landed on Giannis foot in the paint. Harden also reinjured his leg.  Close series with the Hawks until Trae Young got a bone bruise on his foot and was never the same. Also Capella was hit in the eyes in the series and was dealing with inflammation the rest of the way.  Then against the Suns, CP3 gets his ankle rolled by a flagrant foul by Brook Lopez. Booker also smacked in his broken nose again in game 3 of the series. Saric blows out his ACL. Cam Payne and Torrey Craig also suffer injuries during the series.  Giannis put on a show, but nothing compared to what KD did against way better talent"
"Knew our team's strengths so well that adding Bud and Brook Lopez immediately added ~20 wins per season, and took a below-average defense (because of Kidd's terrible scheme) to one of the best.  Sorry to see for Luka and Mavs fans that Kidd apparently hasn't been humbled by his shitty coaching history."
"The Antetokoumpo's win because they're 6'8, 6'10 and 6'11. Size matter too much in these kinds of things.    Last year when Robin Lopez was also on the Bucks reporters asked Giannis who would win in a 2v2, the Lopez twins or Thanasis and Giannis. It didn't take a second for Giannis to say Brook and Robin would win because they're just so huge"
" Because his team didn't start with Khris Middleton, an outside shooter who can also create his own shot.  Because his team didn't get Brook Lopez for free, and turn him into an elite stretch 5.  Because his team didn't get a solid contributor in Pat Connaughton for free.  And thats before they became a KD shoe size away from brutally overpaying for PJ Tucker and Jrue Holiday."
"Brook Lopez was much better? That’s absurd lol, Ayton was clearly our 3rd best player, and was arguably our best player in the wcf. DBook was great in game 1 and CP3 was great in game 6, but Ayton was our best player in games 2, 3, and 4, plus being great in games 1 and 6."
This is why stats are misleading as fuck. Ayton got spoon fed all of his buckets and his rebounding wasnt even that good.          Brook Lopez was much better this playoffs despite having worse stats.
Brook Lopez was on the all defense second team last year. Saying Brook isn't the best on the defensive end is ridiculous.
"Robin Lopez was really great at that for a few seasons, especially with the Knicks. Not sure about Brook"
Brook Lopez is 7 feet tall
Isn’t Brook Lopez an underrated rebounder because he helps his team getting the rebounds by boxing out well instead of going for the rebound himself?  An overrated rebounder would maybe be someone who’s chasing every rebound even though in some cases it would be better to just box out and let a teammate get the rebound or on the offensive board to run back to Defense instead of chasing the rebound. Maybe Drummond or Whiteside?
"Bro what? I swear people just want to ask more creative questions than the last nephew. No one cares about the answer, just the more bewildering low iq question  Which would be more filling, the Giannis 50 piexe or Lebron’s clean diet?   Which is more boss, Jordan with a xigar or Brook Lopez with a cigar and a stuffed dino?"
Everyone needs a brook lopez friend in their life
Brook Lopez is a real life Pixar/Disney/dreamworks character
clippers wanna see pat bev trying to push brook lopez but lopez just taps his arms with his pinky instead
"Yeah, but still in 10 years everyone will have completely forgotten him. It’s just how it goes. Unless you were either truly great or stay in the eyes of the basketball world after retirement, people always forget about players until they turn up in someone else’s random highlights, and then it’s like ‘oh shit remember Brook Lopez?’"
Ngl he would put together a string of 3 to 4 plays multiple times this year where he would just body the opponents run. Spurts like these where he would look like Brooklyn Brook Lopez
"They need to bring back PJ Tucker   He shut down Durant in a few games in that series in games 3 and 4.   If the Nets win either of those games the Bucks don't win the chip.   They also need to think about dealing Jrue Holiday for Ben Simmons. As amazing as Jrue was in this series Ben Simmons is ever MORE of a lockdown defender and they don't need offense in that spot.   Giannis can get fed and the shooting can come from Patty C, Donte and Middleton can run point.   Middleton \[PG}  Donte \[SG\]   Simmons \[Roamer/Defender/Draymond role\]  Giannis \[Shaq 2.0 monster\]  Brook Lopez \[C\]  Patty C \[6th man\]  Portis \[backup big\]  PJ TUCKER \[ Durant stopper only play him big minutes against Nets\]"
OG nets fans Don't mind since i assume they lived worst it's more like the bandwagon who are truly pissed. Remind me when I saw a nets flair say that he didn't want brook Lopez to win a championship.
"Super Team is any 3 legit all stars \[to be legit you must be multi time all star\]   Jrue Holiday and Brook Lopez were both 1 time all stars so they are not legit all stars.   Middleton is a legit all star player.   Giannis/Middleton/CP3 would have been a superteam.   &amp;#x200B;  Brooklyn was only Superteam this year.   If Lakers can add Westbrook, CP3 or Lowry they will become a Superteam too"
"That reminds me of this story my old FedEx guy told me about the time he met Brook. He went to a game somewhere around 2016 or so, and Brook was going nuts in the first quarter, he had about 40 points and 3 rebounds at this point in the 2nd quarter and this guy took his newborn child onto the court and Brook Lopez offered to watch his newborn child for him because he said he had no one else to ask because of covid and he had to work, Brook said he understood and would help him out so he left and Brook left the game too to go home and watch his child so he could go to work. What a nice guy"
My favorite Brook Lopez stat:  First 8 years of his career:  2008-14: 0/7 from 3  2015-16: 2/14 from 3  &amp;nbsp;  2016-17: 134/387 from 3  Gotta love the man for changing up his game and recognizing that big guys can shoot the 3 with the way the league was trending
"It wasn't just Giannis.  It was paying Khris Middleton a max.  It was signing Brook Lopez when he was fired by Los Angeles, and then giving him a raise.  It was acquiring Pat Connaughton for nothing. It was acquiring Bobby Portis.   It was drafting Done Di Vincenzo, and it was getting rid of Thon Maker when he turned into what people thought Giannis would become.  It was backing up the truck for Eric Blesoe, and then backing it up again for Jrue Holliday.  Just Giannis doesn't win a chip."
Bucks were a super team tho. And Giannis is an asshole for dismissing star’s Middleton and holiday and one time all star brook Lopez. Middleton carried Giannis.
I went on Superman the Ride at Six Flags Great America with Brook Lopez in 2019.  It seems like such a long time ago.
Brook Lopez
"The opposite of this is teams like the Cavs when lebron was young, the pelicans with AD, etc who simply didn't want to spend the money or couldn't acquire good enough talent to give them chances to win. But in this situation, the bucks were 100% amazing in their ability to build a team from nothing to champion. Taking a chance on a raw athlete who didn't start playing basketball till he was 12, trade Brandon Jennings for a 2nd rounder who was in the g league and the pistons thought wasn't good enough, sit back and let them develop, make smart moves like signing Brook Lopez, drafting donte divencenzo, signing pat connaughton, trading for pj tucker, going all in and trading away 3 frp and Eric bledsoe for jrue holiday. They did it well and did it right, something alot of owners aren't willing to dig into to get that chip"
"Don’t forget all-star and Net’s franchise all time leading scorer, Brook Lopez!"
Brook Lopez with the lateral mobility of an actual buck
I saw a vid of Brook Lopez smoking and holding a dinosaur. I don't believe it was Brook at all.
Brook Lopez with the very strong drunk uncle vibes here
"The Nets 3th best player is Joe Harris, who's the Bucks 4th best player? Pat Connoughton, Brook Lopez? And then you callt the Nets top heavy. And the funnier part is the Bucks ""big 3"" isn't even a legitimate big 3"
"Bryn Forbes - Game 2 Miami  Brook Lopez -  Game 4 Miami, Game 5 Atlanta  Khris Middleton - Game 3 Brooklyn, Game 6 Brooklyn, Game 3 Atlanta, Game 6 Atlanta, Game 4 Phoenix  Giannis - Game 4 Brooklyn, Game 7 Brooklyn, basically the entire Finals  Jrue - Game 6 Atlanta, Game 5 Phoenix  And that's with just focusing on box scores and focusing on one guy per game unless there were two or more legitimately stellar performances. Add in major plays on defense and things that don't show up on the box score, and I think that list expands to cover basically everyone that saw meaningful play time."
I’m in Brooklyn too and my Brook Lopez Nets jersey is the only one I have. I was absolutely ecstatic last night when he won :)
I remember watching the Lopez brothers vs Ryan Anderson in college trying to decide which of the three would have the best career. Pretty sure Ryan Anderson and Brook were even drafted to the same team
"Love a hall of famer? fuck no, if love is a hall of famer then so is brook lopez, therefore giannis needed a hall of famer to win."
Brook Lopez had a loooong journey to get that ring
Brook Lopez summing up the ketamine experience
"Shows what you know.. Portis is actually pretty mobile for a big man and allows him to switch to the 4 spot seamlessly. Why do you think he was playing instead of brook Lopez. He does this while also being able to score from anywhere. He is like a John Collins. Teams would love to have Portis, he is an uncommon talent.   Let’s just ignore the fact Portis is already a much better scorer than KCP and hasn’t even scratched the surface of his prime. KCP’s prime is being a below average 3&amp;D, averaging 8-9points on mostly wide open shots and playing solid defense but only against smaller guards (he gets destroyed by larger wingers). Portis’ ceiling is being a legitimate 3rd scoring option on a championship contender."
Brook Lopez just played 24 mpg in the finals.
Brook Lopez was a lottery pick though. Raptors had 0 of those.
"True, but what else is Phoenix supposed to do? Trade him? Blow the whole thing up? IMO they need to go all in on trying to maximize what Ayton and the rest of their roster can do.  He was a 34% shooter from three in college, which is respectable. It wasn't a huge sample size (one per game), but it's enough to indicate he's capable of stretching a defense. Seems that part of his game has disappeared in the NBA, but that doesn't mean he hasn't been working in the shadows. Brook Lopez, for example, hit just three threes in his first eight seasons in the NBA. Then in year nine, he made 134, and now he's a career 34% shooter from deep on 1,860 attempts. If Ayton could add that to his game, he'd be deadly, because he's a far better athlete and rebounder than Lopez is."
"Yeah, Teague is horrible. That’s another thing as well. Maybe a guy like Delon Wright could me targeted? Trade Brook Lopez to the Kings so Bagley can play the four and they can let Holmes walk if he wants too much money? Plus I’m sure the Bucks could also get either a second for giving up the better player and/or another piece."
"Improve the bench in a variety of ways. Namely, getting a bucket getter that isn’t just a spot up shooter (see Bryn Forbes). I think the perfect player to fill this role would be Terrence Ross, and he should be easy to get from the Magic since he doesn’t fit their timeline. Bench defense could also be improved, since their only serviceable wings off the bench are Tucker (if Donte is healthy) and Connaughton. A Brook Lopez trade could also be a good option to bring in multiple role players to fill out the bench, since Bobby Portis/Giannis at the 5 lineups proved successful in these playoffs."
"I don't know if you just mean street basketball rules or NBA:Street the video game rules.  If it's just street ball, I think the Nets run the court pretty easily. Kyrie's handles give him a boost, Durant is un-guardable as always, and defense matters less (especially if we're going make it-take it), so the Nets mop the floor like the sweatjockeys under the hoop.  If we're going by NBA:Street gameplay and rules, I think your world champion Milwaukee Bucks take the cake. Giannis can yam like no one else, there's no reach in fouls so you can spam steals with Jrue, and even though in real life there's a huge dichotomy in skill between Middleton and Lopez, in Street you put Lopez in and you can goaltend all day with your Giannis/Brook combo. Also an added bonus is that Giannis can actually make a 3 in the game if you have a Gamebreaker, which gives him an element to his game that he doesn't have in real life.  The darkhorse low-key great team for NBA:Street would be Dallas. Luka, Zinger, and Boban would be impossible to fuck with. 2 7'3"" behemoths for all of your blocking needs. Luka of course would be one of the best players in the entire game, and video games don't capture laziness and bad attitudes, so just by virtue of that Zinger is now a 7'3 shot blocker extraordinaire that can shoot and run the court. Boban is basically Yao, and if you remember Yao in the old Street games he was basically the best player in the game. Bobi's stamina is irrelevant in Street, and his (lack of) speed isn't a problem like it is in real life."
"Was his team really built in a different way than other “super teams” though?  Signed Brook Lopez in FA  Traded 5 firsts for Jrue Holiday  Traded a first for PJ Tucker  Signed Bobby Portis in FA  Signed Pat Connaughton in FA   Particularly the Holiday trade, like that’s exactly what building a super team looks like, even if Holiday isn’t necessarily at the same level as other stars who normally get a haul like that"
"Nope, Robin Lopez signed a 1+1 (player option for second year) deal, for about $5 million for each year (turned down the second year to go make more with Washington.)  Brook signed for the bi-annual exception the year before, which was actually even lower than I remembered - $3.5 million"
"The disrespect to the greatest twin to ever play in the NBA, brook lopez."
"How can you argue that the Warriors titles weren't ""organic""? They drafted Curry, Klay, and Draymond, and yeah signed KD but did the Bucks not sign Brook Lopez, Jrue, PJ Tucker, Portis, etc etc. I don't understand this take nowadays. Giannis is literally the only player that was drafted by the Bucks that played"
"I wasn’t saying that a year ago, but ok.  The upgrade from Bledsoe to Jrue was more like the missing piece.  But the Bucks organization deserves credit for bringing in guys like Brook Lopez, PJ Tucker, and Bobby Portis.  Also for extending Middleton when some thought that they overpaid.  They did a good job building around Giannis."
Giannis is fortunate for all the injury issues his opponents had in the postseason as well as somehow not blowing out every ligament in his knee.   Giannis required so much luck to win a chip this season but at the end of the season he had to put up numbers to win a ring so that can’t be taken away from him once he made it to the Finals.   If either Kyrie or Harden are healthy the Bucks don’t make it out of Round 2 and if Young doesn’t step on the Ref maybe they don’t even make it out of the East. Same scenario if Durant’s foot was 1inch smaller.   Then you look at how Giannis’ knee was bent backwards miraculously with no real injury to it and he was back in a week or so. Basketball gods wanted this one for Milwaukee.   Happy that Brook Lopez got the ring he deserved.
"lol, you’re absolutely insane if you think Giannis would do anything with the Timberwolves teams Garnett was on.  Middleton, Holiday and Brook Lopez are players Garnett would’ve *loved* to have."
"Jrue and Brook made one all star each, both in fucking 2013 lol. They’re good players but not all stars.  Middleton was one the two years before this year, but not this year. He’s a very good player (as are Jrue and Lopez) but this is nowhere near a super team"
Jeff Teague and Brook Lopez obviously
I’ve been so pissed this entire postseason watching them barely get by (except against my heat lol) I was pissed watching them beat the hawks twice without Giannis. I was pissed watching them reverse sweep the suns. Then I saw Giannis right after they won. Why was I so mad? He deserves it. Damn he played his heart out. Heat lost to the champs. Respect. Congrats Milwaukee  Motherfuck brook lopez and Bobby Portis for no real reason though
Yeah he was playing 1 on 1 with brook lopez lol
Would’ve loved to see Brook Lopez say “I’m going to Disney World” on live tv.   Bucks in 6!
Bobby Portis &gt; Brook Lopez
"Uh, he does have a post game. Have you seen him earlier these playoffs when he was balling out? Just got out muscled by Brook Lopez this time. He'll be even  better in a couple of years when he's stronger   I know that this season he focused on his defense and letting the plays come to him. With booker and cp3 taking most of the play calling, he doesn't get to show it as much too."
Happy for Brook Lopez fam
Brook too. I'm so happy Brook Lopez is an NBA champion. Pat too.  They are both such great guys.
Yeah pretty much but Brook Lopez was definitely brought in too open up space for Giannis with his shooting as a big man
Did Brook Lopez rock up at the post match presser half drunk with a bottle of rose and smoking a cigar?!  Fucking legend!
We'll have to wait and see next season how it goes but yeah with this ring he's already proven more than KD ever has in the playoffs. The snake gets over-hyped because he got to play 1 on 1 with brook Lopez but even then he wasn't that much better than Giannis that series.
someone got into the zoom during the press conference and asked brook lopez how giannis penis taste lmfao
we just watched a playoffs with brook lopez and bobby portis getting major minutes in every series. Shaq woulda been fine.
BROOK LOPEZ NBA CHAMP
The Bucks only have one lottery pick on the team and that’s Brook Lopez.
"I hope they have Monty's post-game locker room speech recorded, that shit is going to be inspirational.  Also, props to Brook Lopez.  He, too, had a hell of a game."
Brook lopez is a champion
Brook Lopez just becasue of his insane Nets career and now a ring.
Where is Brook Lopez in all of this
"Brook Lopez is looking around like “I wanna say it, when do I get to say it!”"
Brook Lopez has a ring!
Are Brook Lopez and Bobby Portis the only extroverts on the Bucks?
Lmao Brook lopez just yelled “fuck yeah bitch” right into the mic
right below brook lopez
Giannis proved himself to be elite. Brook Lopez gets a ring. Middleton is a bad man. PJ Tucker is good at defense. Down 0-2 and the Bucks win 4 in a row to win the chip. Really impressive.    Nets 16-0 in playoffs next season*   *^If ^healthy
I'm so so so fucking happy for Brook Lopez
Pretty damn happy for Brook Lopez right now.
I'm so fucking happy for Brook Lopez
"Been watching Giannis since he got drafted, god it’s so amazing how much this guy has come. I mean the guy’s story itself is remarkable. So many mfs kept doubting him too even after back to back MVPs. Happy for the city of Milwaukee for getting that chip after so long. Same goes for Jrue who has been underrated af since the Philly days, and Khash Money. Brook Lopez who was the franchise guy who helped transition the Nets to Brooklyn. Bobby Portis, PJ tucker who has in the league then out then came back again. Coach Bud who got so much hate here. Congrats Bucks and y’all get lit Bucks fans."
Brook Lopez deserves FMVP just because he had to play on Brooklyn for so long
So excited for Brook Lopez to get the finals MVP
And you got Brook Lopez Bobby Portis and PJ Tucker a ring as well
Brook Lopez better get finals MVP
"Happy as hell for Giannis and Brook Lopez but goddamn man, poor Chris"
"##[Brook Lopez has a ring, fuck yeah!!!](https://imgur.com/GiyykkO)  Nets all time leading scorer and still my favorite.   **Congrats, Milwaukee!**   Only mistake the Bucks made was not wearing their awesome green &amp; cream jersey tonight.  Deer Park must be *BANANAS.*"
Brook Lopez
"Just from a bucks perspective Tatum always looks absolutely lost going against Lopez at the rim and doesn't know how to finish on length, and doesn't have the midrange to punish Brook. Only thing that scares me is that bs sidestep 3 that sometimes let's him go off.   Booker on the other hand almost made Brook unplayable at times and he has that 8 to 10ft pull up that makes him much harder to defend. Defensively honestly a wash, Booker player Khris really physical at times but too small, Khris always cooks Boston so idk what Tatum is doing well on the defensive end."
Either Giannis finals game 7.  OR Brook Lopez historic 0-11 from three vs the suns in the regular season (2019?)
The Bucks literally just won the fucking Championship with Brook Lopez as the only lottery pick
"He's a very good roleplayer.  But you can't build a championship winning roster that covers Ben Simmons' weaknesses when you are paying Ben Simmons a max contract.  If he was being paid Brook Lopez money, he'd be a massive positive asset.  Good luck convincing him to take a pay cut, Philly !"
"There is more to defense then just blocking shots at the rim against guards. Its also about mobility both backward and forward and side to side. At overall rim defense he is not significantly better then somebody like Brook Lopez.   And he is significantly worse when defending other bigs. The really good center in the league bust his ass. Embiid uses him like punch bag. Giannis never had issues with him.  His rebounding is not good, but not anywhere near great. Compared to other elite defensive centers he is very much one of the worst. Defensive rebounding is part of being a great defensive center.   When talking about switching he is really not very good because his side to side movement and food-speed is limited.  All that said he is a really good overall defender, but people who talk about him as DPOY are just wrong.  I just think people overrate him because he has high block %."
Brook Lopez was a giant steal a few years ago also. Went from making 20+ million to around $3 million.
"I know like 3 real Nets fans. They aren't as interested as they used to be. There was a charm rooting for guys like Brook Lopez, Devin Harris, Kris Humphries, TWill, Troy Murphy, Anthony Morrow"
But Blake was shooting from 16 before then. Same with Brook Lopez. I'd expect guys like Boban or Steven Adams to be more realistic at getting there too since they've shown good touch on shots from that distance.  There aren't guys who went from not even shooting FT length jumpers to shooting 3s at a serviceable percentage
"Brook Lopez is another example people use, he shot fewer 3s than Simmons over an even longer period. But like he was always a good free throw shooter and always took jump shot 2s. No one has gone from a Simmons-esque lack of shooting to being a decent 3 point shooter"
The new Brook Lopez. Similar stats too lol
"Pop is our biggest weakness. For context in 2019 we lost to France with Brook Lopez sitting on the bench. Perfect guy to pull Gobert out of the paint. Nope, he barely played. He will screw up at least one of these games again, and pray KD and Dame pull it out."
brook lopez too
"Also prime Brook Lopez career year, and 50-40-90 Middleton “but he’s gotten so much better”. They were the most dominant team in the league, analysts we’re picking them over the KD warriors, hadn’t lost 2 games in a row all season. Until they essentially got swept by the 2019 raps in the ecf."
"I agree with running it back.  The bench situation is a minor situation we should address, I think there should be a ton of vets who’d like to come in and prove themselves. Maybe we can try to get a direct Forbes replacement with another shooter who’s worth a minimum, or Oladipo could be a viable option. I’m kinda torn on Oladipo since I think he offers the same thing Donte does at this point (viable spot-up shooting, penetration, and a dash of playmaking and great defense). Only thing is I hope that it doesn’t hinder Donte’s development. Maybe even Merrill is tried out as a Forbes replacement.  If Portis leaves, that’s really gonna suck. I don’t think you can find another guy who offers so much as him on a great contract, he was really a diamond in the rough. He’s the first backup acquisition that actually worked for us in the Bud era if you remember the Marvin Williams and Mirotic days. My guess would be a vet on the MLE.  I’d keep Lopez for as long as we can because I don’t believe there’s a true reason to move on from him. He’s only at $12m a year and still provides floor spacing, rim protection, and low-post scoring if needed. All you need is a viable, switchable backup five to spot his minutes. That way you have the advantage of going big with Brook against guys like the Hawks, or going small against guys like the Nets.  If we’re able to keep Portis and Tuck somehow, we’re in a phenomenal spot."
"Exactly. He needs to go to a team where the big will sit outside like brook Lopez. Give him space, let him be a screener without a big in the paint so he can roll hard, let him crash the glass. Porzingis, markkanen, jjj, etc"
"I sat near an entire section of nets fans in game four of the series that were there to do the free throw chant. The entire time their were two dudes behind me taking about “X bucks player is a bum” and I remember one literally saying    “Brook Lopez is a scrub who can’t score”  Okay, then who’s your all time leading scorer dumbass?"
"Zion played less than half the season... Was not as good as Randle. And that's not mentioning D'Angelo Russel, Jordan Clarkson, Brook Lopez, and Kyle Kuzma. The latter 2 of which were playing heavy minutes on the last 2 championship teams."
"Middleton got drafted by Detroit, played his rookie season there before getting traded to MIL.   Holiday was traded last year.   Pat Connaughton, Brook Lopez, Bobby Portis was a free agent signing."
"OP surely doesnt watch basketball - longer than 5 years.   5 years ago, you had the World team, just from NBA players:   Manu, Pau, Mills, Bogut, Calderon, Rubio, Rodriguez, Ibaka, Dirk, Gallinari, Dragic, Horford, Tony Parker, Batum, Fournier, Gobert, and younger Simmons, Embiid, Porzingis, Jokic, Antetekoumpo, and so on ..   Add Navarro, De Colo, Lull, Scola ...   Need I remind you that USA team, even though not at full strength, realistically 3rd or fourth best team, finished 7th at world cup 2019 ? Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Joe Harris, Brook Lopez, Middleton, Mitchell, Plumlee, Smart, Tatum, Turner, Kemba, and White  You are underestimating world teams, and Euroleague."
"You are very wrong, they got a MVP Superstar in Giannis, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday are All-Stars level players, Brook Lopez and PJ Tucker are excellent role players. Align with that Bobby Portis, Pat Connaughton and Bryn Forbes who are decent role players.  It is very difficult to make a team as deep as that. Most of the teams that have 1 or more superstars, don\`t have a bench as good and tall as Milwaukee.  And they got lucky their biggest opponent is this playoff, who was Brooklyn, 2 of their 3 best players got injured..."
Brook Lopez still a Net at 💜
"I’d definitely say yes, LeBron even back then was one of the most unselfish played in the league. If he has a lockdown perimeter  defender like Jrue Holiady, an inconsistent but good Kris Middleton, and a paint presence in Brook Lopez with solid depth and it’s over. They still sweep the Heat, beat the Nets in 7, and beat the Suns in 6."
The defense of the Bucks on the pick and roll.  Are they utilizing drop coverage or are they switching everything?   How much is Brook Lopez being abused in this series? How many minutes is he getting?  What are the tactics the Suns are employing to try to stop Giannis? Are they building a wall? How good was the wall if they were?  How easy is it for Ayton to get looks at the basket (in comparison to previous series)?
Milwaukee always starts slow in series ( we lost game 1 aganist nets and hawks and needed last second OT shot aganist Miami) plus we were switching way too much on defense aka brook Lopez covering Chris Paul lol
I mean we did acquire MASSIVE free agent Brook Lopez.
"Our defense with Giannis at center and without Lopez was even better then the defense with Lopez. A good coach could have an elite defense with the team of the year before or the that year. Brook is not required for us to win 60.  And regular season Bledsoe was fire in the system we played, and Holiday would not be a huge improvement, maybe a few wins."
Brook Lopez please
Chill out dude. It doesn't take an expert to realize a guy who likes to slash and can't shoot isn't complimented well by a big who likes to be in the paint. There's a reason why the Bucks starting C is Brook Lopez.
Simmons excuses list:  1. They tried trading me for a top 5 player who shoots :( 2. I shouldn’t have to shoot :( 3. It’s their fault for building around their MVP caliber center instead of me :( 4. The fans were too mean to me :’( 5. Doc and Embiid criticized me for not doing what any basketball player in history can do :( 6. Embiid didn’t transform into Brook Lopez :(
"Yea looks like Yao did have 5th metatarsal break, but it was navicular break that ended up being final straw. And after googling looks like a bunch of guys have had them and been fine. So idk where we got the idea that they ruined a bunch of careers. Based on the guys below, it seems like it is definitely not something extreme that always ends careers.  KD and Ben Simmons both had them. Then found this info in an article. Rasheed only one career ending, but he was probably at the end by then.  [More from an old Reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/55akho/list_of_nba_players_w_5th_metatarsal_fractures)  Blazers guard C.J. McCollum needed surgery to repair a Jones fracture before the 2013-14 season even began. He didn't make his debut with Portland until Jan. 8, although it's worth pointing out that a similar injury sidelined McCollum during his senior season at Lehigh.  Nets big man Brook Lopez underwent a pair of season-ending surgeries back on Jan. 4, including a procedure to repair a Jones fracture. The other procedure was a ""first metatarsal osteotomy, in which another bone was repositioned in his foot to 'unload and protect the injured area.'"" He missed the final four months of the 2013-14 season. Lopez also suffered a similar injury back in 2011.  Lakers rookie Julius Randle has dealt with a Jones fracture, and had a screw inserted into his foot during his senior year of high school. The injury didn't require surgery over the summer despite frequent speculation, but it's going to be something to watch for the young forward as he starts his career in L.A.  Warriors guard Nemanja Nedovic missed most of the summer, including the 2014 FIBA World Cup, while recovering from a Jones fracture. He's expected to be ready for the start of the 2014-15 season.  Rasheed Wallace's career was essentially ended by a Jones fracture, as he missed four months during the 2012-13 season with the injury before making one final appearance in Knicks uniform in mid-April."
Brook Lopez and Ayton in no way lead an offense?
Brook Lopez and Deandre Ayton started at the 5 for the teams in the Finals what are you talking about
"There’s not many honestly. Probably KAT, Jokic, or Brook Lopez.   In all honesty Embiid wasn’t a terrible C for his game. He would play on the perimeter to give Simmons space to drive to the rim and operate down low. He could run the court some.   Simmons is going to find out - and already has - that your success is going to be handicapped at a certain level when you can’t shoot. Come playoff time teams won’t even guard you and will make things super difficult on the defense. It’s why guys like Kidd and Rondo worked so hard to improve their shots."
Ben Simmons would be perfect to back up Giannis lol. Needs a brook lopez
There are like 5 centers in the league that make any sense with Simmons and Embiid is one of them lol. AD and Brook Lopez-not realistic options. Jokic-why take the ball out his hands.  That leaves KAT as the only realistic option that helps Simmons.  Does he think playing with a traditional or rim running center is going to do him any favors? Lol
"Weight is def an issue that's going to a lower body concern for him, Jones fracture or no. But big guys had had them and recovered fine. KD, Brook Lopez, and Julius Randle, for example. He's def gotta lose weight if he wants to recover like those guys, though."
"In terms of more role player options, I think Myles Turner or Brook Lopez would be good fits around Simmons."
Brook Lopez wasn't closing out most games in the playoffs.
… Brook Lopez?
"Good luck contending for a championship with a team built around Brook Lopez and Ben Simmons, though."
"Brook Lopez is probably the best player from a fit perspective but he’s nowhere near as good as Embiid.  Jokic and KAT would fit on offense to an extent, although Jokic in the post is better than Jokic on the perimeter in my opinion but both Jokic and KAT aren’t exactly great rim protectors."
"Yes but most centers still don't shoot as much as Embiid.   Only Vuc, KAT, Horford, KO, Brook Lopez and Jokic made more 3s and some of those played time at forward too."
Myles Turner or Brook Lopez could be interesting
"He can lead a team to a championship if you surround him with like Steph, Klay, KD and maybe a Brook Lopez. You need to build the perfect team around him."
tbf man kidd didn’t have brook lopez who is basically the key that unlocks milwaukee’s offense alongside giannis
"The jazz guards are not that good in perimeter defense they don't have a guy like bridges there.    I'm sure Murray will score and make it close. Ayton is not golbert, sure he is worse against a guy like embid but he is one of the most switchable bigs in the league.  Seriously, look the fg% of elite perimeter scorer against him and it's really good not only compared with other bigs but with guards too.    My point is as far as offensive talent goes the nuggets should be dominating opponents in theory. But making threes at a high clip is not good if you still surrender layups.   I know jokic is not the fastest but I assure he is faster than brook Lopez. Tell him not to gamble on steals and contest vertically and deep drop. And make the guards run over screens until their legs give up."
Up there with the legend Brook Lopez
"To answer your second question: the general push for more 3s is centered around the idea that on average, players score more points per shot from 3 than from long 2s. They don't even have to be that good at making them. All they have to do is hit one out of every three, and it's more efficient than mid-range shooting. On top of that, if a big man can make 3s on a passable level, they might be able to pull the people guarding them (sometimes a rim protector) away from the rim making it easier for their teammates to score at the rim.  Again, that's an AVERAGE rule of thumb that can be used when trying to build a team for regular season performance, but it doesn't necessarily have to be true for everyone. Some of the best players are players that are efficient at things that other players are inefficient at, and they feast because defenses are geared towards trying to incentivize those inefficient plays.   Also, a lot of analytics analysis is geared towards regular season performance. That's where you have the most data among the widest variety of teams. But playoff basketball is completely different. The stakes are higher and players perform differently under pressure and against opposition that is better than what you see during the regular season. On top of that teams get to make adjustment after adjustment during a 7 game series, so players have to resort to techniques and skills that are deep in their bag of tricks and not the efficient plan A and B tactics they use during the regular season when they bounce between playing good and bad teams. It's more important in the playoffs to make situational adjustments than it is to just run the same strategy you did during regular season games. In individual moments, especially in high-pressure situations, sometimes it's more important to just get a bucket instead of trying to follow an efficient long-term strategy.  So everyone obsesses over 3s in a context that's kind of different to the examples you brought up in the post. Giannis, who is not an average player, feasting in the finals against a specific team vs general team-building strategy and the skills you'd like to see in an average useful player based on regular season performance over large sample sizes. Another interesting wrinkle in bringing up Giannis is that it's not him, but his teammate, Brook Lopez, who developed a passable 3pt shot, so that allows Giannis to feast down low without both of them clogging the same area."
Pre switch him off screens and let him roam the paint. Basically refuse to switch or use drop coverage like the bucks did with brook Lopez. They would get killed from time to time by someone like dame or curry getting hot but you live with that when you have a guaranteed.  2 points on the other end
"And that was against hall of fame rim protectors and defensive legends while also having limited spacing since everyone ran two big men.   He was fighting Hakeem/Robinson/Ben Wallace/Rodman/duncan/Yao/Ewing and more during his career. Imagine him going against the likes of Davis/green/Jokic/gobert/KAT. All guys who struggle against size inside. They’re more fit to guard the rim and be mobile from the weak side rather than straight up bang in the post. The only guys who would really stand a chance at even slightly slowing down a Shaq would be boban, embiid, and maybe someone like adams/brook Lopez? Most of the undersized mobile 4’s and even most of the pure centers just don’t have the size or ability to contend with a true 7 foot 300 pound monster."
Zupac becomes baby brook lopez
He had Giannis on him as a primary defender and the switch was either jrue or Pg tucker so he was in for a long night. The difference if had embid was the fact that whenever he kicked it to bam his center was terrified of brook Lopez. Embid regularly beat brook.
Nets all time leading scorer brook lopez
Like Brook Lopez has more of a leg to stand on than Irving in terms of building the nets lol
real nets fans became bucks fans the second they got brook lopez.
[Xavier Henry over Jeff Withey](https://youtu.be/7h8zVlCmX4w)  [Larry Nance Jr over Brook Lopez](https://youtu.be/5pqfvWthszA)  [Larry Nance Jr over KD](https://youtu.be/-n7MPfgeWJQ)
Myles Turner wouldn't be able to do what Brook Lopez does
"He’s an elite coach and the idea that he underperforms in the playoffs is nothing more than fake news that has been repeated enough that the idiots on here believe it. He has literally never lost a series with a team that was more talented than his opponent and the only year he actually had prime D-Rose in Chicago resulted in an ECF run and loss to Miami’s big 3.   He won a playoff series in 2013 against DWill/Joe Johnson/Brook Lopez with Nate Robinson as his best scorer before once again being eliminated by Miami’s big 3.   Even his last year in Chicago when he he had a diminished, post-ACL version of Rose they still won 50 games and won a series before once again being eliminated by LeBron (and Kyrie). And they even went up 2-1 and had the Cavs in trouble in that series.  Mans kicked the door in last year and immediately schemed a ragtag group of castoffs with the lowest payroll in the NBA (and the lowest over/under win total in Vegas before the season) to a 41-31 record.   Elite coach who the Knicks are lucky to have and Chicago should have never gotten rid of."
"Yeah the only way we become a superteam is if Lonzo or Pat (rip) become all stars or we trade for someone. Now that he's not the entire offense of his team, Vuc seems to be on the trajectory to have a bucks Brook Lopez type role than an all star. DeMar could maaybe get all Star consideration if we're a top seed going into the break but far from guaranteed"
"also, I am not even convinced that Turner is an upgrade over Lopez.  At least Brook can put the ball on the floor a little &amp; create his own shot.  Also even though Lopez doesn't grab a ton of rebounds himself, his teams always rebound better when he's on the floor, Turner is shaky on the glass."
"Brook Lopez is more ideal to play with giannis in the playoffs. He's also proven. Myles is not. The only benefit is that he's younger than Brook. But you don't mess with a championship winning team, if you're the Bucks. Not yet while Giannis is at his peak"
May we interest you in a slightly used Brook Lopez and a slightly injured but very promising Donte?
"I've had the uncomfortable experience of being both a Bucks fan and a Nets fan (shoutout Brook Lopez for making this my reality), and it always confused me when people imply Giannis doesn't go looking for fouls. He doesn't do it the same way Harden and Trae do, but he definitely does this thing where he will just run into defenders (it was more common when the ""wall"" was a thing) and either fall down or flail the ball and hope for a call."
"Seriously. To be clear my beef isn't with the team third - Heat/Jazz deserve those places, but it's like they went out of their way to avoid suggesting that Brook Lopez is important to the team, or that the Bucks aren't a walking case study in why Centres are still important right now."
They unironically should. 90% of defensive rebounds are meaningless. Brook Lopez averages like 4 rebounds a game and is one of the best players for team rebounding.
Brook Lopez blocked KD's layup in OT
"CJ McCollum barely even more impactful than Lonzo for lot of teams. Would easily take Lonzo, Bridges, Brook Lopez."
Brook Lopez is one of the best true stretch 5s in the league because he's such a good rim protector too. Lonzo's defense is crazy this year and his shooting has improved a lot too. Mikael gives you great defense with good IQ and scoring. Those three guys are easily worth a top 20 player in the league. The guy thinking Ben Simmons is worth more than those three is on crack.
"I’ve always thought he would excel on the Bucks in the Brook Lopez role IF he didn’t mind being the 3rd/4th option, but based on recent years, it seems like he would not be willing to accept that."
"I always chuckle when ""fans"" of super teams that have been farm status up until a week ago try to trash the pistons because we have had some down time. I'm sure you were a huge fan of those Brook Lopez teams."
Friendly reminder that Luke Walton took a team with 3 top-10 draft picks and 20 ppg Brook Lopez to........35 wins
"""In my lifetime I can not think of a player who has made this much of a jump in his shot so suddenly."" Brook Lopez 16/17"
Fire budenholzer and maybe move brook lopez. I fell like they can’t become any better
Things are looking dire for the Wizards.  They might have to sub in Brook Lopez with a wig and hope the refs don't notice.
"What if I’m Joel Embiid in the paint and I just pump faked Brook Lopez, who is between me and the basket, out of his shoes? You’re telling me not to jump into him and get the and-1? Sounds like a pretty short sided strategy by someone who’s never played the game."
"If talent in HxH works the same as basketball, LeBron is by the most versatile guy ever.   What I mean by that is that very few players have enough talent to re-arrange their games like LeBron has in his career. Even guys like Brook Lopez who were able to add a jumpshot did not go full re-conversion, but LeBron added to his game seemingly every season. I think the main switch on jumpshots appeared somewhere in his second cavs stint, where he was starting to pull post up fadeaways like crazy, hitting insanely deep shots. The guy just has unlimited talent."
KD is locking down Brook Lopez in the post. Insane. He has levels to go to when he wants to turn it on. And offensively? he's offensive.
"A lot of their shots in the 1st half were rushed. There were a handful of plays where they made 3 to 4 passes that led to a decent shot (i.e. wide open jumpers from Brook Lopez). Other than that...they seemed desperate to match Brooklyn's pace and sharpshooting. In both instances, they failed."
"Stop paying attention to this guy, he looks like a fool for focusing on all the semantics when it's perfectly clear what you mean. He can't adress the elephant in the room that Giannis has been underperforming heavily in the post season for 2 straight years after having had a historic regular season last year.   People claimed the Bucks roster on pace to 70 wins pre-covid was the most well-rounded roster in the NBA - Brook Lopez was elite defensively and stretched the floor really well, Brogdon Beldsoe are above average starters, George Hill shot 50% from 3 in the fall of his career and brought great Vet presence and so on. Giannis performed so well in the regular season setting we thought he would be the player next in line after Bron KD Harden and Steph cooled down eventually. So he has to be viewed with the same eyes as them. But what he shows in the regular season or first round EC playoffs doesn't translate to the first opponent that poses a tricky matchup.  He still has a very balanced roster around him, Jrue Holiday was everybody's dark horse darling and rightly so. This is a team good enough for a finals run but they can't execute once Giannis faces some problems on offense. It has to be on him at some point. His vision isn't developed enough, his fundamentals are very much lacking. He has all the talent to be an all-timer but it has to happen during the playoffs at some point. This being said I'm not writing him off at all and still think Giannis will be truly unstoppable given time but the likes of Bron KD Harden Steph or Kawhi/Luka/AD/Jokic always put up a fight and are capable of dominating singular games so much they will their teams to a W against eventual champions or other all-time great talent. And this is something Giannis hasn't been able to prove yet and right now it looks like he's folding yet again against the first real threat in his post season run.   I'm tired of people bringing up his post season stats inflated by weak EC first and second round opponents. Even against the Heat people claimed 21 points on 54%TS with a load of rebounds was Giannis being ""good in the series"". It just doesn't cut it."
"KD is simply a better basketball player than Giannis  It's ok, Shaq needed Kobe and DWade before he could win as well. When you're playing Brook Lopez and Forbes major minutes that isn't Giannis fault"
"Yes. And comparatively, Brook Lopez is very useful now for the Bucks because he shows up in the paint.. long range shooting becomes an option now for him and he serves the team well battling inside."
"Depends honestly. He had a chance to be with Luka in the Mavs next year. They'd have been absolutely perfect for each other. And the closeness of their age would let Giannis compete for chips throughout his 30s. He even shores up KP's weaknesses defensively without taking away his strengths (perimeter shooting and rim protection, ala Brook Lopez with a higher offensive ceiling)."
"The main reason is that every single Bucks role player except Brook Lopez sometimes just sucks in the playoffs. Even with Bledsoe gone, their supporting cast just sucks"
"they're also playing PJ Tucker and Brook Lopez heavy minutes along with Giannis, 3 pretty mediocre shooters. Losing Divincenzo really hurt their spacing, and when Middleton is bricking everything its hard."
"Between the first and second game he went with a smaller lineup, I’m not sure if that’s from the harden injury but he had Durant essentially playing center and matching up against brook Lopez this game which he didn’t do in game 1."
"To add on to my post a little, the Bucks seemed to make an adjustment in Game 2 by having Brook Lopez out on the perimeter more. This seems like the opposite of what was working in Game 1.  To Lopez credit, I believe he hit 2 threes in the first quarter, however I also think the Bucks did not take a single shot under the basket in the first quarter, they actively seemed to move away from what worked in Game 1. (Huge points in the paint advantage)  TERRIBLE COACHING."
"Bud.   Their game plan was to put brook lopez in the paint snd look for mismatches?!! What the fuck? When you have Giannis matched up against old man Blake? Are you fucking kidding me?   Their game plan was BROOK LOPEZ. Not getting athletic freak of nature own off curls and screens because there’s no way in hell Blake can chase Giannis all game. Seriously. Brook  Lopez.   When I tuned in in the first few minutes I though Giannis must have been on the bench because he didn’t even tough the ball for 3 straight trips down   Bud is absolutely lost. Where’s the adjustment when he realizes they’re packing the paint on Giannis? Why wasn’t this games up beforehand? Oh it was ==== brook. Fucking. Lopez.   When the raps schooled the shit out of bud I gave him a pass because Atlanta was fantastic and fun as hell. But after us trashing him, Miami last year, and blowouts so far this year, I don’t know why  not a coach in the nba if this is the best of the best"
Brook Lopez is a perimeter threat.
"Ah, so the issue is that you don't know what a ""jump shot"" is. Which is obviously going to make it hard to understand what a ""jump shooter"" is.   When I say a ""jump shot"", that doesn't mean a 3 point shot.[ Here's a video on Durant's jump-shooting game,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S3n3yb7o1Y) you'll see the vast majority of his shots are jump shots.    There's actually a lot of different types of jump shots that he has. Except for the 1 dunk they show, every single shot the video shows is a jump shot.     Building on this, a jump shooter isn't someone who can only shoot jump shots. It's someone who predominantly shoots jump shots.    &gt;you act like they can’t do shit other than shooting from the 3  Go back and re-read my first comment:   ""G1 when Joe Harris comes off the DHO they crowd the restricted zone and concede the FT line jumper.""  I'm not talking about his 3s here. I'm talking about Joe Harris also having a good mid-range jump shot.   [I'm talking about this play specifically.](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=372&amp;GameID=0042000211&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Harris%2018%27%20Pullup%20Jump%20Shot%20\(10%20PTS\)%20\(Griffin%203%20AST\)&amp;sct=plot) It's not a 3 point attempt, but notice how he **jumps** and **shoots**?  That's a jump shot.   When Harris drives in with the ball, he's not the kind of guy who attacks the paint and tries to dunk/layup on you. He wants to stop right on that FT line and shoot.   So when Brook Lopez is defending Harris' drive, he should guard him a little closer so Harris can't get that shot off and you're not super worried about him blowing past you to attack the rim.   Brook Lopez looks like an idiot because he's hanging back and waiting for Harris to try and dunk on him. Which obviously isn't how Joe Harris plays.  Harris is a really good example of a jump shooter.   ***    Kyrie and Durant are also jump shooters. They can drive and attack the paint but they generally don't.   They are predominantly mid-range jump shooters who are famous for their mid-range jump shots.  At least ~70-80% of their shots are jump shots. So when you're defending them, you don't focus entirely on stopping them from getting to the rim, because that's not how they like to score.  You don't defend Kyrie and Durant the same way you defend Westbrook and Giannis.   ***  I'm not saying they can't do other things besides shoot 3s. I'm saying you defend a player's strengths and tendencies.   Against Giannis, you focus on defending the rim because he's very good at attacking the rim. You let him take jump shots because you're not afraid of his jump shot, he can take them but they're not as good and he doesn't like to take them.  Brooklyn is a team full of guys who like to shoot jump shots and are very good at shooting jump shots. So when you're defending Brooklyn, defend the jump shot."
"The Celtics exploited the Nets switch-everything defense by getting Tatum any matchup he wanted, hence why Blake got played off the floor. Giannis can't punish defenders in the same way.     On the other end, the Bucks are giving Brooklyn tons of easy looks by playing drop coverage with Brook Lopez."
"When Marks got hired Brook Lopez and Thad Young were their best players. Traded Young for Caris, traded Lopez for DLo. Drafted Jarret Allen. Signed spencer. Hired Atkinson. Made it a desire place for Kyrie and KD. Then traded the young guys for Harden and still found gems like Mike James and Claxton. This maybe considered a superteam but they built their way into this team. Sean Marks is one of the best GMs"
Buds defensive scheme and utilization of Giannis is really bad though so he deserves blame. The Nets involved Brook Lopez in as much action as possible on the defensive end to get great shots but instead of Bud running Giannis at the 5 to stop that he just let them cook Lopez in drop coverage all game
Yeah and it certainly helps to get clean looks in almost any action involving Brook Lopez. I love Brook but if the Bucks continue to play drop coverage with their bigs all series it won’t be a long series. Also pulling out a 2-3 zone with Bryn Forbes might be a strategy you keep in the locker room especially against the Nets shooters.
Play Giannis at the 5.   If KD and Kyrie are going to continue to abuse drop coverage brook lopez he is damn near unplayable.
Brook Lopez just stands at the three point line. Does it even matter?
"Have you ever considered that open shots are created because of bad TEAM defense? Bud really had them playing drop coverage in P&amp;R and a 2-3 zone against one of the best 3 point shooting teams in the league. If you have to scramble to catch two of the best midrange shooters in league history off the dribble around fifty screens a game and the coach is using Brook Lopez as an orange cone in the paint, the torching is inevitable. Watch the games"
"We had some fun teams when they weren’t injured with Lin and Lopez. And honestly, watching Brook Lopez grow as a player with the Nets was something to look forward to every day. Just a bit sad we had to move on and now do this without him"
Brook Lopez drop covering KD and Kyrie. Great defensive gameplan from coach Bud 😬
"The coach is supposed to set his team up for success and make quick adjustments based on the flow of the game.  For game 2, there isn't much he can do at this point to win the game, the team is getting outplayed in a number of key areas.  However, for the last 2 playoff runs under Bud, the Bucks have run a steady offense of ""Give Giannis the ball and let him go 1-5 whilst surrounded by shooters"", this strategy works in the regular season, but as we all know, in the playoffs the good teams will ""build a wall"", which shuts this strategy down.  Another issue with Bud is that he does not seem to adjust his minutes schedule much in the playoffs, I'm not going to go on about this issue in great detail because it's been covered on this subreddit a lot, other teams play there superstars 40 minutes+ in big series, whereas Bud keeps Giannis at sub 40 minutes in must-win games.  Lets go back to Game 1:-  The Bucks were crushing the Nets at Points in the paint, both Giannis and Lopez were dominating inside, Lopez was 8/11 from the field, and yet he played just 27 minutes. The 3 point shots were not falling for the bucks, so why not adjust your game plan and push more at whats working? Take the ball inside more on the nets where your bigs are hot.  Late in the third quarter, Kevin Durant gave up his fourth foul, he told Steve Nash to leave him in the game, and he did. The next few posessions, Durant was guarding Brook Lopez, someone he has trouble guarding in the post, the Bucks (Coach Bud) could have run a play to post Brook up on Durant and try to draw a foul and put him on his 5th foul heading into the fourth quarter, but no such adjustment was made.  These are the kinds of adjustments that great playoff coaches and championships team make, if the Bucks want to win a championship, I believe they'll need a better coach then Bud, who has had limited playoff success.  In my opinion, the biggest problems for the Bucks start with coaching. That being said, I do credit Bud for finally moving away from the ""Giannis 1-5 with 4 guys sitting on the wing strategy"" and putting the ball in the hands of Holiday and Middleton more.  I also don't understand why the Bucks don't run a few post up plays for Brook Lopez, the guy is still a GREAT post scorer, you could run 2 plays a quarter for him in the post and you'd probably get some great quality production, but instead they relegate to just sitting him on the perimeter. He is still effective, I just think they could get more out of him. The Nets would have trouble guarding Brook inside with his size and strength, especially when they are running a Griffin-Durant combo."
see my comment to the other guy--  &gt;switchign every time to shutdown star players is a fuckign pipedream. Kevin and Ky are getting whatever the fuck they want regardless what brook lopez does.  obviously playing drop against shooters is tough but kevin durant and kyrie irving will get their shots either way to a certain extent so its like shrug lets just do what we do?
well the jazz maybe could play some drop coverage and hope for the best  the bucks cant keep up on offense so thats probably not an option for them seeing how this is all going  but i guess my point is that switchign every time to shutdown star players is a fuckign pipedream. Kevin and Ky are getting whatever the fuck they want regardless what brook lopez does.
lopez has been their best player sometimes  i dont know what the bucks issue is but i dont think its brook lopez
I will forever love Brook Lopez but he needs to play like he's a 7 footer if the bucks are going to have a chance
"They got a lineup of Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez, Brynn Forbes, Jeff Teague and Patt Connaughton 💀💀"
How are  you nets fans feeling about brook lopez rn?
Griffin being a flat out better Brook Lopez is not something I expected coming into the series.
my god how many fucking years does brook lopez drop coverage need to get cooked before you fucking idiots stop defending bud
Man I wish we could have seen Grant’s face when he told Brook Lopez to body KD and not settle for fadeaways as he attempts a turnaround fadeaway
BROOK LOPEZ NEEDS TO BE BENCHED
Lmao everyone shitting on Brook Lopez when he was our best player for 9 years and our franchise leading scorer
Because for some reason Bud is in love with playing Brook Lopez. It’s baffling.
"why are coaches so stupid  it was so obv the lineups with caruso and gasol were horrible, yet we played them  it's so obvious brook lopez can't play against this small nets lineup, but he's still in"
Brook Lopez can’t play in this series. Giannis has to play the 5
you can't play brook lopez in this series
&gt;They both play with a transcendent star who is good enough to be the best player on a championship team  We talking about Brynn Forbes or Brook Lopez?
Giannis got 2 I think you were looking at Brook Lopez
sheeesh mike james almost matching minutes with brook lopez
#BROOK LOPEZ HAS MORE POINTS THAN GIANNIS
How Brook Lopez have more points that Giannis?
When Brook Lopez attempted that turnaround fadeaway jumper I knew it was over lmao
"Poor Jrue, him and Brook Lopez are the only ones who showed up."
"Brook Lopez is actually really good in the post, see his early 2010s days. His game is similar to pau gasols"
"He's just clogging up the paint for Lopez anyway, and he's getting destroyed in ISO on the other end  Brook has to bail that dude out so often in the playoffs."
Brook Lopez vs the world. get him help FFS.
"Yeah because you totally drafted Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holliday. The only good player on your team who is home grown is Giannis."
"Trust me I love me some brook lopez but that’s why I’m so fired up about this team, we’ve been in the gutter for years and for a change have a team that has a real chance"
If kd is going to guard brook Lopez they just need to go to the post every damn time.
Why doesn't the bigger Brook Lopez simply consume the smaller Kevin Durant
I’ve been watching Khris Middleton shrink in the playoffs for 7 years.. he’s not who people think he is. Jrue is decent but nothing special. Brook Lopez is also decent nothing special. KD and Kyrie outweigh all of that star power is real. Talent matters
Kd literally just hugging brook Lopez but gets the call each time smh.
"I like Brook Lopez lmao, and not used to being the ""overdogs''"
Bucks for Brook Lopez. Wizards for Robin Lopez.
They are guarding Brook Lopez with Joe Harris.  Maybe put more spacing around him so he can go to work.
Giannis and Brook Lopez are taking midrange jimbos I'm losing my mind
"If you're relying on brook lopez to get your offense going, you're probably doing something wrong"
"I dont understand what Bud is trying to do. We literally showed them that you have to stop the role players to have a chance against the Nets, but the Bucks ain't doing anything to stop them. We played Claxton off the floor with Tristan Thompson, and you are telling me that you can't do that with Brook Lopez and Giannis?  Offensively they ain't moving the ball at all, its just bad ISOs over and over again. The Nets have really bad defenders on the floor but I see no one trying to attack Irving or Griffin, and when the double comes they never expect it so its always half a step too slow, allowing the defence to recover."
Only the Brooklyn Nets showed up so far.  I’m counting Brook Lopez in that.😢
Brook Lopez is a great post player and has 40lbs on KD.
"A lot of this is on Budenholzer. For some reason he has Brook Lopez playing in the low post on offense now, when two years ago when they almost made the finals and were their most successful, Lopez just stood outside the three point line. Bud is unintentionally clogging up the lane, making it harder for Giannis to drive."
Imagine Dallas with Brook Lopez
Did you just say Brook Lopez can't post up KD?
"Brook Lopez can't consistently beat KD off the dribble or in the post lol, his greatest strength is hitting open jump shots so they're playing to his strength"
Brook Lopez tricked y'all
Brook Lopez is the only one who can stop his former team
Brook Lopez doing it in his old place 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Brook Lopez was playing too well of course Bud had to take him out for trash Bobby Portis.
At least Brook Lopez came to play today
Will Bud play his star Brook Lopez more than 28 minutes tonight?
"jimmy had to get through giannis, jrue, and then brook lopez. what did randle have to get through?"
If bucks decide to not run plays down low when the nets have 0 centers on the floor I'm gonna die laughing. We had Harris guarding fucking brook Lopez at one point and brook didn't get the ball once.
"This doesn't disprove your overall point at all, but the year the bucks got Bud was also the year they added Brook Lopez."
Brook was not the issue. He killed Brooklyn on the glass and inside. Yes the drop defense isn’t ideal but we switch everyone other than Lopez and we did a decent job on KD overall. Need to pressure Harris more certainly but I don’t think anyone is expecting Blake to play (or shoot) that well again and if he does then you can start adjusting.
"First, the Bucks big three each have to play at least 40 minutes. Bud really needs to stop with that, it doesn't work one bit, so stop trying to preserve them.  Second, play less Brook Lopez and more PJ Tucker at the 4 or 5. He's strong enough to hold his own in the post and can extend out to the perimeter if need be. Brook can't.  Third, pray that your shots go in the basket. Khris and Jrue were a combined 13/42 from the field. Chances are they don't shoot that horrible for the rest of the series."
That’s a compliment to Porzingis. He’s Brook Lopez without the defense or mentality.
The 4 finals was more so due to playing with Lebron and playing in the weaker East at the time. I think just LeBron and Kyrie alone could’ve made the finals. Porzingis had tons of potential too but I think the injuries severely altered the course of his career. The way I see it if he goes to a new team and learns post moves he’ll be like a Brook Lopez type player.
"How about letting Brook Lopez play more than 27 and ask Khris (6/23) to stop shooting 3s, since KD who was guarding Lopez most of the time had 4 fouls with 14 minutes left?  Sounds like a good idea? Should I blame Lopez for not doing that or Bud?"
Brook Lopez was an absolute baller with the Nets
Brook Lopez &gt; Kristaps Porzingis
Brook Lopez is a beast. Wonder why he's underultized
"&gt;Also, Brook Lopez, who was by far their efficient scorer (8/11) only played 27 minutes.  You can't really fault Bud for not playing slow ass Brook against the (2nd) greatest shooting team ever."
"Even as an impartial observer, I was extremely frustrated watching this game because of Bud’s very obvious incompetence. The fact that he didn’t exploit mismatches on the inside, especially when both Giannis and Brook Lopez were shooting the lights out from down low, was baffling and legitimately infuriating."
"&gt; How about they get some secondary offense going rather then throwing up their hands and saying ""threes won't falling""?  They did - and those shots *also* didn't land. Outside of Brook Lopez and Giannis the team shot **32%** from the field. It was a terrible shooting night from every spot."
We don’t call him Brook The Sorting Hat Lopez for no reason
"It was mostly Celtics defensive gameplan for much of the series was to switch everything on screens which meant that Nets would hunt out an isolation switch they wanted and then go to work. Celtics did the same thing in return to the Nets because the Nets also play a switch-heavy defensive gameplan.  The Bucks are playing more of a traditional drop coverage look most of the time especially with Brook Lopez out there (because he certainly cannot switch onto even slow guards and forwards, which means the defense can get pulled out of position a lot more as they rotate to cover the action."
"Sometimes yes but in this case, it's not really defense being 'bad' (which the Bucks defense definitely wasn't). It was mostly Celtics defensive gameplan for much of the series was to switch everything on screens which meant that Nets would hunt out an isolation switch they wanted and then go to work. Celtics did the same thing in return to the Nets because the Nets also play a switch-heavy defensive gameplan.   The Bucks are playing more of a traditional drop coverage look most of the time especially with Brook Lopez out there (because he certainly cannot switch onto even slow guards and forwards, which means the defense can get pulled out of position a lot more as they rotate to cover the action."
"Again in a vacuum KD and Kyrie are better however in the context of this series. PJ Tucker, Middleton, Jrue, and Giannis as defenders can do enough to contain KD and Kyrie and by contain I just mean stop them from going ape shit and dropping 35, 40, etc. And that clearly happened this game. If they can keep both KD and Kyrie to 25-30 points each that's a win for them because ideally someone else on the Nets will have to step up and make shots and plays. The Nets got surprise showings from Blake Griffin and Mike James. Will that continue to happen? We will see. However the reverse is not true for the Nets. They have no one to stop Giannis or Brook Lopez for that matter. So if they can just get some decent play offensively from Middleton and Jrue they can rock the boat. I'm not making predictions on who's going to win or not, just commenting that the Bucks aren't ""easily underdogs"" in this series, there's a reason they beat them those last 2 games of the regular season where Harden ain't play."
"What about guys like Myles turner, Jaren Jackson , and brook lopez."
"Brook lopez is a beast in post easily but playing with giannis, he changed his role.   His paint protection is great but he isn't a shot blocking machine even when he basically live in paint and easily exploited by anyone that is faster than Kyle Anderson."
Myles Turner is probably number one.  Brook Lopez.  If KP ever stops sucking again it's him as well.
Need a Brook Lopez pod where he interviews players and sorts them at the end.
How many minutes do you think Brook Lopez has in him vs the Nets?
Brook was pitful in defense. I lost the count on how many wide open midrange shots kyrie and kd sank off the pnr where lopez sank back
If the Nets lose I'm definitely rooting for Brook Lopez &amp; the Bucks; I get it.
"I don't understand why the bucks don't run some set plays for Brook Lopez on the low block, after all these years the guy is still a very crafty inside scorer. When Durant had 4 fouls late in the 3rd quarter they had a number of opportunities to post up on Durant, but didn't.   Seriously, just running 2-3 plays a quarter for Lopez on the low post would get a decent boost in high % looks at the basket."
I think Lopez gets eaten alive if Giannis isn’t on the floor. Giannis help defense helped brook from getting absolutely mudded on the switch
"Bad shooting selection was the reason of why the Bucks were so bad from 3 tonight. They need to stop with those early 3s and start moving the ball a little bit more to find better looks. Playing so fast is leading them to many turnovers and the Nets are a team that can willingly punish them considering how good they are in transition. So, the first thing they need to do is to slow up the tempo.  They also have to capitalize the size difference and try to put the ball at the low post more oftenly. Playing Giannis as the screener would be a nice adjustment too considering how aggressively the Nets are defending the PnR with this ""up to touch"" coverage and their continuous helping. Having a good decision maker as your roll-man will force the weak side defenders to stick to their players.  As for the defensive part, if they want to continue doing that drop coverage with Brook Lopez, they need to put players with longer wingspan like Middleton and Giannis on the perimeter to contest these off-dribble 3s. Kinda like what Utah does with Mitchell and Royce O'Neale."
"I agree that the play for Beal is unlikely, but this move does put us in better position to do that should it become an option.   You're 100% right on the latter part and this doesn't really change much in terms of outlook for the team next year, Kemba and Horford were similar level impact players. I view Horford as kind of a smaller Brook Lopez now, his defense is still really good due to sound fundamentals and IQ, and his offense is exclusively 3 pointers now and functioning as a nice DHO partner for Tatum. As we've seen with the Bucks in this series, they are better off without Brook and playing small with Giannis at the 5. That may end up being true about the Celtics next year in the playoffs, although they don't really have a small ball 5 option."
"not true, i mean, kemba was a fucking beast on the hornets, but alas he just cant stay on the court nor be the shooter/distributer we needed him to be, at least w horford we get a big  (which we really really need) and he can stay on the court for us, horfords kinda like brook lopez at this point just worse, and kemba is just, really a backup pg at this point"
He passed Lebron because he got to play 1 on 1 with Brook Lopez LOL
"Giannis told the bucks to play drop scheme with brook Lopez in the 3rd to blow an 18pt lead in game 5, yes"
"What are you talking about Lopez is a 34% shooter on nearly 2000 attempts his last 5 years in the league, he’s been below 33% on one of those years. Tucker is a career 36% shooter and hasn’t been under 33% in any the past 5 years. He was 39% with us this year, without Harden, and is also a corner 3 specialist which is the looks we’ve gotten him. Brook is taking 3.8 a game (and shooting 34.7%) and Tucker is taking 3.5 a game this series, it’s not like they’re each taking 10 a game completely ruining the offense. On the list of problems with our offense, those two taking wide open 3s is way way down on the list of problems."
"Sounds like a Brook Lopez problem to me. Which Bud adjusted to by playing Giannis at the 5 like I BEEN saying.  Game 6 KD: 32 pts on 30 shots, 7 turnovers, -25"
Dude Seth Curry is like the 3rd or 4th option most nights. That would be like saying Brook Lopez is a better player than LeBron James this year because he got further in the playoffs.
If we lose because Brook Lopez drops 40 I could live with that.
So basically Giannis cant guard KD bc Brook Lopez cant guard KD
"Seriously tho, seeing Slow ass Brook Lopez getting switched onto KD was hard to watch last game, make it so the switch is still very guardable, instead of arguably the greatest scorer of all time against Brook Lopez"
Then Bucks have such a good center in brook Lopez tho would be a waste of his talent for Giannis to play a lot of 5
We need Phil Jackson.  And we need to trade Brook lopez for Javale McGee or Dwight.  Also look into picking up Zach Lavigne. And possible everyone except Giannias for Dame or Curry.  Curry most likely not leaving with Clay and wiseman coming back.  Dame was never gonna leave Portland but now would be the time to reach out if ever.  But Bud and Lopez have to go regardless of outcome
It’s crazy how much better they look without the corpse of Brook Lopez just standing in the corner
No Brook Lopez and Milwaukee is switching EVERYTHING. Making it so much tougher on Brooklyn to score. Giannis attacking the rim and no three pointers.
WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH HOLIDAY  also crazy what a DPOTY can do instead of Brook Lopez and PJ Tucker on defence Bud
"Bucks doesn't even try to double him, brook lopez can't help because he's slow like a snail.   This is why we need bobby portis, a big body who's 100x more mobile than brook"
Brook Lopez runs like he needs to take a shit
brook lopez looks like a crab on defense
"Milwaukee bucks, bud keep playing brook lopez as catch and shooter instead of bobby portis, one of the best three point shooter this season is a crime and should be sentenced to life time jail."
Brook Lopez has 3 rebounds. 3
"Why doesn’t Brook Lopez, the largest player on the court, simply eat the smaller opponents?"
I hate watching brook Lopez take long contested 3’s. Might as well be 6’3”.
Brook Lopez the kinda dude to show up nude to a Bar mitzvah
jeez the reflexes on brook lopez
on that play brook lopez had harden guarding him
WHY DO YOU SWITCH BROOK LOPEZ ON KD. WHYYY
Brook Lopez the scorer
Wearing my Nets Brook Lopez jersey at an all time conflict with myself cause idc who wins I just want a good game 💀
Brook Lopez eating for some reason
so how many threes is brook lopez gonna take?
Brook Lopez doing his bud duty hanging 4 feet outside of the 3 point line. Makes sense
Brook Lopez eurostep floater… perfect start
brook lopez again? start the roast lmao
"He hasn’t been given a championship caliber roster… even with the one that he won with, they weren’t given a chance to run it back.   If you’re that against him, I’m sure you’re happy with the status quo. I guess you like watching a bunch of random isos from Giannis/Middleton/Holiday with Brook Lopez standing at the corner and not being utilized as a post scorer against a much smaller team. But according to you, this all could be fixed if Giannis develops a jump shot."
"This right here. Brook Lopez a very talented post scorer in the C position, being guarded by people like Durant and Jeff green and he doesn't get any touches in the post."
They have to listen to their star player if it’s in their best interest. The Packers aren’t trading Aaron Rodgers yet because they haven’t received a deal that’s in their best interest. The Nets had a yearly story of putting Brook Lopez on the trading block but only ended up trading him when it was in the teams best interest.
I could tell that they were losing when I saw that one play of PJ Tucker being left on an island with KD and a WIDE OPEN PAINT WITH BOTH BROOK LOPEZ AND GIANNIS ON THE FLOOR LIKE WHAT THE FUCK  KD hit an insane pullup but he could have just driven to the basket tbh and the Bucks wouldn't have done shit
"If everyone on this roster apart from Brook Lopez was 3 years younger, they would’ve been able to contend against the Heat"
Simple solution is to get rid of brook lopez and drop coverage and still play giannis on kd lol. Drop coverage hasnt been working
Giannis matched up vs KD a lot in the 2 May games even with Brook on the floor. If KD is abusing Lopez in the drop coverage the obvious adjustment will be to play small with Giannis at the 5 like we did see at the end of those May games.
"so unless it's a foregone conclusion that because giannis cant shoot, we will forever never win a ring, the coaching staff needs a plan to circumvent the fact that giannis is being gameplanned against for not having a reliable outside shot.   and the gameplan that I've seen has been completely nonsensical, such as jrue holiday ISOing KD for long twos and brook lopez not posting up joe harris. so either we skip 4 years of giannis supermax and trade him for not being able to shoot, or we try an easier method of getting a new coach in who might use the tools we have differently"
"I mean, I'd say they have a superstar (Giannis) with notable limitations in the playoffs, 2 borderline all-stars (Holiday and Middleton), then you've got PJ Tucker (36) and Brook Lopez (solid stretch 5).  They have some other okay pieces, but I'd hardly call that loaded, and if you take Giannis out of the equation it's pretty mediocre.   I generally trust the FO to handle the ""Kemba situation"" which isn't as bad as some people think, and they've got some other pieces (Smart/Timelord/Fournier if they resign him).  Like I said, right now, I'd say the Bucks are probably in a better position, but coaches aren't necessarily looking at 3-year windows.  I don't think it's unreasonable to say the Celtics are a better job if you're looking for the next 10-12 years or so."
"People always say NBA players hit the genetic lottery and while it’s true there are levels, random people people like Trae Young, Jordan Clarkson, Seth Curry, Brook Lopez even are all really athletic but you can tell they’ve worked at their game and basketball skill is out of this world. Ben Simmons is the other spectrum, still relying on his size and speed and that’s it. If he was 6 foot 2 with this work ethic and skill he would’ve never sniffed the NBA"
"They were telling the same thing of why Giannis was not on Butler last year and got gentleman swept as a result.  Giannis' defensive IQ is way higher than his BB IQ. Look at him working on Butler just a series ago...  No, not puting him on KD has more to do with KD being a perimeter player. They should play drop with Giannis roaming the paint. If KD gets free he finds Giannis who is the only person in the planet who can actually block him, not freaking Brook Lopez allowing him an open middie.  But then that's asking from Bud to adjust. Guy was 2-0 and played the same defense on game 3 as well. He was barely saved from a sweep. He never learns, he barely adjusts. They deserve to lose."
"Yeah, it would not be an ideal matchup. Lopez can pull Capela out to the 3 point line and away from the paint while Giannis could be matched up on Collins with a lot of space to work. Unless Nate switches those two (where Brook could bully Collins in the low block) it’s a much tougher matchup defensively in the front court just because of Brook’s 3 point shooting. Hunter would be nice to have in that series to try and form a wall defensively on Giannis but he won’t be back till next season.  With Philly, you can take Embiid settling for jumpers because there’s no one else to pull Capela out of the paint, and he can just bully anyone down there to begin with. It’s a different formula with Milwaukee"
"I feel like they saw the loss in game 1 and decided nothing was good about it, because I don't know how brook Lopez went from getting 10 shots in the post to 2"
"Boston has attracted more highly compensated UFAs from other teams than any other team since 2015.   Al Horford in 2016, Gordon Hayward in 2017 and Kemba Walker in 2019. Kyrie was traded. That is three unique UFA signings.  GSW has 5 big dollar UFA signings, but four of them were already with the team. Cleveland had three, with all of them being resignings (Lebron, Lebron and Love). Dallas got DeAndre Jordon twice somehow according to my data, and resigned Nowitzki in 2016. Miami signed Butler, and resigned Whiteside and Wade. Brooklyn got Kyrie and KD, and resigned Brook Lopez. Toronto resigned FVV, Lowry and Derozan.   Three other teams had 2 big salary UFAs, 12 teams had one, and 8 had none."
"To be fair, he’s also been cooking Brook Lopez in drop coverage."
Brook Lopez is playing rn for the Bucks
Somehow the whole Brooklyn team will get injured and the Bucks will lose to 10 g leaguers camping the paint and cooking Brook Lopez on high screens.
If Brook Lopez has a brain they lose.
"Hawk.  Even if we match up againts embiid, I'm confident brook lopez to guard him as long ref don't bite easy bait foul by embiid"
That Brook Lopez clutch block at the end. He was good tonight
"So we got 2 seconds left, let’s get it to brook lopez in the corner so he can pass it"
"Brook Lopez, what a game he played"
Wtf was that Brook Lopez inbound? I almost threw my phone at the wall
Brook Lopez with the vintage JR Smith play at the end of the 4th had me sweating.
"All Brook Lopez had to do was put the ball up with 1 second on the shot clock tbf, that would’ve reduced KD’s opportunity to tie/win the game"
Brook Lopez redeemed himself with that weak side block
I still can't believe Brook lopez almost threw away a year of prime Giannis with a move so dumb and thats like the 10th most interesting thing in this game
Brook Lopez came up big in the last minute with a huge block and rebound. Before those plays I was thinking he’d never be allowed in Wisconsin again.
Is brook Lopez legally allowed to say the n word now?
What you on about? Brook Lopez hit the game winning FTs...
Bud really thought the best inbounds play was to get Brook Lopez the ball then have him pass to Middleton like that would make him wide open and work really well. He must be so in his head he lost his mind for a bit.
"Brook Lopez with the late game blocks, Insane !"
"Joe Harris, Harden and Brook Lopez are all trash. lol"
That play to Brook Lopez when he didnt shoot..........................
"One of the biggest snakD haters you'll find, but I gotta give man his props. Dude was outta gas and had to do it all for his team. Efficient night again and was a source for the team whenever they were on a cold snap. This loss ain't him. They will prob takeover the next two years but it's nice that they could let someone else win this chip.  Brook Lopez went from being America's most wanted to redeeming himself with those defensive stops at the end. I'll let the rest of y'all give due props to the 2x MVP 1x DPOY. Solid win!!"
I'm very relieved for Brook Lopez.
Brook Lopez still playing for the Nets
Can anyone explain what the hell was happening with the inbounds play to Brook Lopez in the corner with 2.7 left on the shot clock? Like wtf was the plan there? Brook looked like he didn't know there was only 2.7 left on the shot clock.
The Brook Lopez fuck up to end regulation will also be lost to history. Lmao he's gotta be so relieved.
Brook Lopez is still the greatest Net of all time
Brook lopez needs to be thankful that Durant wasn't born with feet half a size smaller
Bucks beat the Avengers and the refs. That Brook Lopez possession is one of the worst thing I've seen after that JR Finals mistake and our 3 point shooting.
"I think we are all here for that Brook Lopez Redemption Arch.  He won our hearts with the first points of the game, then lost them when he pulled the ""JR Smith"" special.  A HERO ALWAYS FINDS A WAY.  And he did when he blocked Durant, and secured a rebound on the following possession as well.  How did he top it off?   The same way he started it, scoring the last points of the game.  GG BIG MAN"
"The Bucks made it unbelievably harder than it should've been (looking at you, Brook Lopez), but they made all the stops when it absolutely mattered"
"Going back a bit, Brook Lopez is a pretty good 3-point shooter and FT shooter, and he was All-Defense just last year. He's invaluable late in games."
IM RICH BEYOTCH!! HONK HONK  Okay not rich but my bar tab is paid. BROOK LOPEZ YOU BEAUTIFUL ASSHOLE
Brook Lopez running over to hug some old person. Cute.
Brook Lopez breathes a sigh of relief after almost costing the game in regulation.
Brook Lopez scored the first points of the game...and the last points of the game...GG Big man
Brook Lopez getting awarded with the actual dagger lmao
"brook lopez is trying to stat pad, cancel this man!"
I find it very amusing that the Nets are one game away from going to ECF and Brook Lopez is taking free throws as the *Bucks* send the Nets home   Brook was their man!
Brook “JR Smith” Lopez almost became the most hated person in Wisconsin
Brook Lopez was so close for being banned from Milwaukee.
Brook Lopez would have been forced into retirement if bucks lost this.
It's not coz of defense they lost.  It's coz harden is playing on one leg and kyrie wasn't there that's why.   Their defense held up pretty good this series.  That brook Lopez shot clock violation happened at the end coz Durant straight up closed his vision by raising his hand that's great defense.
Brook Lopez i snot dying tonight
BROOK LOPEZ REDEEMED
"Fuck.  GG, Bucks!  Go get Brook Lopez a ring!  I need a drink..."
you can kill Brook Lopez on the court and you still wouldn't get called for a foul
Brook Lopez got bailed out on this one.
Brook muthafuckin Lopez ladies and gentlemen
Brook Lopez redemption arc
Brook lopez still owns brooklyn
They didn't draw it up for Lopez to get the ball. The play was designed to get Middleton coming off a screen and Giannis cutting to the basket. Giannis got held by Griffin and they played great D on Middleton.  Y'all are dumber than Bud if you think an NBA coach drew up a play to get Brook Lopez the ball over Giannis or Middleton
This OT has given the best and worst of Brook Lopez
Brook Lopez saved the game!!!! What a redemption
BROOK LOPEZ CONTRIBUTED!!!
Brook Lopez redeeming himself with that block

brook lopez is still a nets player at heart
Brook Lopez passing the ball in the final seconds of the 4th quarter is such a Wisconsin way to lose. My advice for people living in Wisconsin. Don't watch sports. It's depressing.
BROOK LOPEZ
What a block by Brook Lopez
Brook Lopez is a net at heart
It’s been ten minutes and I’m still shaking my head at brook lopez holding onto the ball
Net's second best player Brook Lopez.
Brook Lopez sellin
Brook Lopez should be exiled from basketball.
Brook Lopez hitting a buzzer beater 3 is how this game's gonna end. Triple Agent Brook Lopez.
ESPN app says 'Brook Lopez vs. Kevin Durant'.  I'm assuming they are fighting MMA style at center court. Who's winning?
Brook Lopez is a bigger choker than the entirety of the Utah Jazz
Brook Lopez should not be on the floor
"The nets, refs, and brook lopez vs the other 4 bucks… doesn’t seem quite fair"
Brook Lopez and PJ Tucker have combined IQ of Jrue Holiday's FG% today.
Nice pass giannis you pussy fuck. 2x mvp deferring from a layup to brook fucking lopez
 Brook Lopez bruh
Giannis is being passive and Brook Lopez is shitting the bed.
Brook Lopez thinks he still plays for the Nets
What is brook lopez offering in this game right now
"Brook Lopez might be the worst player I've ever seen, and I'm a Nuggets fan."
brook lopez lmao
Brook lopez is a plant throwing the game
Brook Lopez should never see a court again
Brook Lopez has gotta get shot out of a cannon
Brook Lopez is a paraplegic. Get him off the fucking court
Why is Brook Lopez constantly in slow motion
I’m still thinking about that Brook Lopez turnover.
#WHICH WAS WORSE? GIANNIS SHOT OR BROOK LOPEZ PASS
Brook Lopez frankenstein ass can't really get that rebound huh...
Brook Lopez sold.
brook Lopez man what the fuck
Pat has been better than Brook Lopez
Bucks deserve to lose this. Or at least Brook Lopez does.
Brook Lopez is a double agent
Brook Lopez is pathetic
"Horrible awareness, but also why are you passing to Brook Lopez with 2.1 seconds left??"
"Bucks could have won by so many ways , either Giannis or Jru sink in one more FT, or two actual in bound plays not the dumb shit they did.  &amp;#x200B;  Still can't get over how Brook Lopez cornered himself and just threw away the ball."
"The Nets with the long con, Brook Lopez double agent. Love you Brook"
I always thought brook lopez looked kind of stupid that one possesion just confirmed it.
Worst: JR Smith or Brook Lopez?
Lmao Brook Lopez hurt
And you are not getting what I'm saying. Giannis at the 5 is not get him to go downhill and play closer to a basket and get Brook Lopez to get the fuck off the floor to win. It's that simple. Everything you say is also valid but it's call playing chess.
"Giannis running downhill was how he lost 2019. You seem very stubborn on noy playing giannis not close to the basket which is his fucking strength. That's how they won game 7 vs nets. It doesn't matter, it's not about giannis guarding Trae. It's about creating optimal space and having Brook Lopez get off the floor."
He's not against a post player either. Capela is just a rim runner. Giannis has to play the 5 to get the best out of the team. Bud needs to hold this strategy and use it in the last 3 minutes of a close game. You can't just stick with drop coverage with Brook Lopez cuz that's just stupid af.
But they had massive amount of luck and ALMOST CHOKED that game with that Brook Lopez play before KD game tying shot
"They can't play their bigs against Trae at all. Are you that dense? They don't have any other option than to ask their 5 or 6 man rotation to play harder and do more. Brook Lopez isn't going to get faster, BP's defensive IQ isn't just going to get better. But you know what I can ask players to do? Give more. He's capable of it. Yall need to stop babying these guys."
Brook Lopez being sorry on defense is doing that even though everybody could've predicted it
"I believe you as an old head. Hedging is an old defensive gameplan that has its flaws in today’s NBA. The main one is that guards are just to quick and too good shooters for Brook Lopez to hedge. All Trae has to do is clear the screen and there’s no way in hell Lopez makes it back to Collins or keeps up with Trae.  The drop coverage is used mainly for slow bigs when Icing the screen. Jrue has to try and force Young away from the screen and stay above the screen to take away the 3pt shot. Portis is there to contain the drive.  Technically, Shaq was right in that Holiday should be forcing Young away from the screen and into Portis instead of fighting over the top. But also Portis is just way too far off to provide any sort of resistance to Young anyways, so it’s just a collapse from both players"
"No disrespect to Trae´s performance but if the Bucks supporting cast can´t help Giannis with the basic stuff they are supposed to do, this series is going to be a nightmare for them.  - Brook Lopez only 2 rebounds in 20 minutes.  - Middleton 0-9 from 3pt.  I like the Bucks but that is definitely not how they beat the Nets."
Lmfao brook lopez good try my dude
Brook Lopez maybe
"I’m not saying he’s a bad player, but when you already have so much perimeter firepower, why not bring on another big (Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, Christian Wood, Jarrett Allen)"
"Thank you. Get the fucking ball out of his hands after he's been wearing Brook Lopez as a party hat for the entire game.  They have more length, more athleticism and good defenders and the Bucks play in a way that minimizing those advantages so fucking hard"
"We saw absolute basketball deficiency by Bud for 3 quarters. I don't know what Brook Lopez gave to him to let him play so fucking much. Lopez is an horrible defender for this level, he is good only in the paint but you cannot drop cover all the pick and roll you are in. And Bud sawing that in the last series should have benched Lopez by now...   That's a shame to see a 2 times coach of the year coaching so bad. A shame for the NBA and how cast those kind of votes."
"Thanks ,  exactly 🤣 i guess maybe casuals are ok with living with a 35% role player who's cold as well, to jack up a 3 with 20 seconds left down 1...  Imagine when lebron was on the heat, if they imbounded the ball to lebron and he heaved it over to a wide open shane battier with 20 seconds left ,down by 1 and Shane just airballed a 3... It would never happen. It's a joke that people are defending this. It's almost like coach bud is actually telling pat to shoot that and telling Brook Lopez to forgot that there's 2 seconds left on the shot clock. Is he telling them anything in his timeouts...the bone head decisions they keep making are unbelievable. It's exactly why the tnt crew has been clowning them this whole postseason. It's a miracle they even got past the injured nets."
Brook Lopez had 2 rebounds?
"Brook Lopez was still that guy when they signed him. He’s played a different role for them by choice, not because he’s unable to be that guy anymore."
Saying what Brook Lopez used to be doesn’t really help them in 2021.
The Bucks were really missing Brook Lopez’ 5 career rebounds
"Although he hasn’t faced an elite one in the playoffs, he hasn’t gotten routinely roasted in the regular season. For whatever that’s worth. I am well aware that it’s not the same in the playoffs as the regular season, but based on it I can assume he’s at least not as bad as brook lopez at it"
bucks can bench Brook Lopez. Jokic can’t be benched so you have to live with him getting abused. Same with Rudy because of big ass contract
What exactly does brook lopez do for the bucks that makes him one of the core players?
"Obviously Atlanta was better - they won the game. But we're still dropping points on the offense, and giving them away on the defense, from the most easily fixable stuff. The good plays happen, work, then immediately cease. What was the % on those Giannis alley oops? Now imagine if they were ran more than 4 times a game.  Like for me the biggest was that Brook Lopez was bleeding points because he's on layup-deterring duty against the 6'1 point guard with one of the easiest floaters in the league. Then, while Giannis has Clint Capella on him, we're using Lopez offensively to... catch and shoot 3-pointers? He's 7'0 with a size and weight advantage on his defender who plays a position down. I swear if Giannis shot 35% from 3 Bud would make it his entire game."
"They why are you drawing up plays for them to take more threes? Middleton is great in the midrange and has a nice floater, Jrue is an underrated player off the drive, Giannis is fucking Giannis, and Brook Lopez is 7ft tall and used to be a 20ppg scorer who could score from anywhere on the court. I get that the missed shots are on the players, but misusing them falls on Bud.  There’s no reason Jrue Holiday shouldn’t have been the one to take those game tying three attempts at the end of that game. The fact that he drew up plays for two dudes who we’re having g bad shooting nights instead is totally on him."
Probably because The Lopez brothers are both some of the best at boxing out in the league. Giannis rebounds shot up when they acquired Brook. And I remember when the Blazers got Robin LaMarcus Aldridge went from like 8.5 rebounds for his career then he went up to 11 with Robin. Boxing out is a lost art
"The way Trae just murdered them with the teardrop for like 5 possessions in a row, then abused the pick and roll with Collins for 3 in a row, then went back to the teardrop was giving me 2K PTSD.  It was like when you make it to the NBA but you don’t have clamps yet and Kyle Lowry is just running you down like the degenerate that you are. And you’re just like “please Kyle don’t do this to me, I’m right here. I’m literally right in front of you please Kyle!”  But it doesn’t matter because he’s blowing by you like you don’t exist. Post fades, layups, step back mid’s, and they’re all green. And you’re just like “please 2K can I just play like, a little bit of defense” But EA is like “not until you spend at least $50 on VC”  Anyways, Trae Young did to Brook Lopez what everyone has been saying other players do to him since he got drafted. He showed everyone who he was tonight. Legendary performance."
Yeah but who could've possibly known Trae would exploit Brook Lopez and drop coverage like KD could. It's not like Trae takes and makes the most floaters in the league.
"Understandable, if you mad about anything it should be Bud keeping the 7 foot traffic cone formerly known as Brook Lopez out on the floor in the third"
"Maybe but the Bucks are also just a really dumb playoff team. Their game plan was to let Brook Lopez get cooked over and over again in drop coverage against Trae for the first 3 quarters. They played the same stupid drop defense against KD for 7 games and he hunted Brook Lopez the entire series, the Bucks never adjusted."
Dude most of Trae's shots were wide open floaters or 3s with Brook Lopez watching from afar. That's Bud's famous drop defense. Any elite guard can have 50 point games against us but its usually not enough because we make a few 3s and we win anyway. Even rookies have 50 point games against this defense(One rookie from the Rockets did it this season).
This is definitely a coaching problem cause even as a fan of the winning team the fact that Brook Lopez was hunched over and had his dick and balls in the paint playing drop for 3 quarters was what won us the game. He was unplayable against Brooklyn and he's unplayable now but because they won by the skin of their teeth he's gonna play that horrible drop all series
Brook Lopez got hit with the nba street gamebreaker
because he keeps Brook Lopez on the bench
"I loved both of the games you mentioned. But I think Bucks' defense today was not good. I think there's something wrong with scheme for defending pick-and-rolls. Also, maybe Brook Lopez is not playable in this series imo."
"I see the real issue after watching some clips.   When Brook is on the floor the bucks are HUGE and destroy the glass. But Trae gets the drop coverage, and can floater, draw foul, lob, open corner shooter every possession reliably on drop coverage.  Bucks take out lopez, they go from huge team to small team, PJ can’t punish Collins on O, and now Hawks have size advantage and a desperate Capela Collins duo is overwhelming the small bucks lineup on the O glass.  There really isn’t an easy solution to this. I guess they have to stay small and just play scrappy and fight to outplay the hawks size.  I rather die to Collins/Capela on the glass than allow trae to get 20 floater looks a game on Brook. Also they should pray both Jrue and Middleton show up at least somewhat."
"He gets to feast, playing against brook lopez instead of embiid."
"Theres a reason why he scored 48, look at brook lopez on and off rating  Trae didnt even shoot that well from 3 he got it from floaters, you bet your ass hes averaging 35 plus if they continue that drop coverage nonsense"
I mean they are forced into playing small ball because Trae absolutely cooks Brook Lopez every time he’s out there. They defended Trae a lot better with no Lopez but then you give up more boards.
"I just remember the Game 1 takes of, ""you can't expect Lowry to put up 30 a game"" in a game where Brook Lopez put up 30, which was very sustainable."
Capela is thanking the man above going from Embiid to Brook Lopez
"One thing that really bothered me was that Bud never put in Brook Lopez for the last 4-5 minutes, and they continued to get out rebounded by both Capela and Collins. I was mind blown that he didn’t learn the first two or so times."
Trae   Giannis   Jrue   Ballboys   Random fans   Brook Lopez   A dog   Toddler   Garbage Can   Khris Middleton.     I think that's rated correctly.
Brook lopez allowing  Trae to hit practice shots in first half
He was just about to pass it out to Brook Lopez too I think
Brook Lopez just going to see Trae floating all over him in his nightmares tonight like a spooky ghost.
Coach bud? Brook lopez?
"For all that, I'd rather Brook Lopez be out there."
giannis was close to throwing it to a wide open brook lopez
what happened to brook lopez
Coach bud going to put in brook Lopez to guard trae down the stretch.
Not having Brook Lopez amazing what happens.
"Brook Lopez -16, lol"
How the fuck is brook lopez 7 feet tall with 1 rebound? I literally just need 2 more from him
Brook Lopez
"please bench brook lopez, unleash the jrue pat khash ticker giannis lineup"
Holiday channeling Brook Lopez
Jrue “Brook Lopez” Holiday
"Brook Lopez is -16, maybe sit him the rest of the way..."
[Clip Request] Trae Young repeatedly torching Brook Lopez and shimmying
"For everyone saying Portis needs to play over Lopez, they’re abusing him the same way except he’s smaller than Brook.  Arm chair coaches"
Why is Brook Lopez?
"For the love of god, get Brook Lopez out of there."
the fact that Brook Lopez is still in the game is just embarrassing.
Why did I think this game would be any different? Stop playing Brook Lopez drop coverage for chrissakes!
I agree with Chuck.  Brook Lopez isn’t playable in this series
It’s so fucking hard to root for the bucks when their coach is this fucking stupid.  Brook lopez has been attacked almost every play since tip get him the fuck off the floor
will brook lopez ever figure out how to defend the floater?? my goodness
Brook Lopez is the most valuable player on the Hawks right now.  How does an NBA coach not seeing the gaping hole in their gameplan? He’s literally getting attacked almost every possession
Trae - shows that he has the best floaters in the game  Bud - LET'S PLAY DROP COVERAGE AGAINST HIM GUYS. BROOK LOPEZ DO YOUR THING.
"This is why the 76ers would have been an easier matchup for Milwaukee, vs Philly all Bud has to do is bench Brook Lopez for Pat Connaughton and double team Curry cause other than Embiid he's the only offensive threat"
LOL Brook Lopez poking Trae Young
What is Brook Lopez doing that’s a positive on the court right now??
Lmao anyone else see brook Lopez trolling Trae
brook lopez tapping Trae is killing me
Some players can play on an injury. Bogi cannot. Just take him out and let him rest till he's ready for a different game. Brook Lopez could blow by him rn.
Brook Lopez is one of the weirdest players in the league
Trae pls just keep going to the floater. Chase Brook lopez off the floor!
Brook Lopez lost out there
Brook Lopez chucking up 3's like Steph and dunking like Shaq. THIS IS WHAT WE NEED.
"The matchups in this series are so thought provoking. Like, does Trae actually try to guard Jrue? Can John Collins hang with Giannis? Can Brook Lopez guard capella on the p&amp;r? Who guards huerter? Who sticks Middleton? WHAT THE FUCK?!?!"
"Uhhhh Brook Lopez is 7'1 and 280, you think he wouldn't be able to back Collins down if he wanted to?"
smdh the Brook Lopez disrespect
"If we don't judge by the results what do we judge by? The Billy King Nets had a hope to win a championship with Deron Williams-Joe Johnson-Paul Pierce-Kevin Garnett-Brook Lopez and then from there sign free agents, but that didn't work."
"The biggest thing is that their defensive stoppers are actual two way players. Holiday has a versatile offensive skill set with being one of the best guard defenders in the league. If we have to start Solo to try and slow down Giannis, he gets to play Free Safety on defense, PJ Tucker can hit 3s and body Gallo, Brook Lopez can take either Collins or Capela out of the paint or bang down low on the low block.   Matisse Thybulle and Ben Simmons are great defenders, but they aren’t offering you anything on the other end of the court"
"draymond, also didnt they say brook lopez?"
Did I really read that Brook Lopez is the Bucks Killer?
Brook Lopez playing drop coverage against Booker and CP3? God help us all
"And this is why Brook Lopez and Jrue Holiday are going to determine this series in my opinion.  If they can play the pick n' roll effectively, the Bucks likely win in 5.  if they struggle it could be 7 or a loss.  But I trust Brook a even more than the average Milwaukee fan.  he's been our most consistent playoff performer the last 3 years, and he's elite at playing the pick n' roll when there's a lob threat.  He doesn't give away whether he's playing the lob or the shot until the very last second and still contends well on either.  Jrue also should be able to bother Trae from behind without getting caught as much as the average defender.  As long as they play to their normal capabilities, and the Bucks stay home on the other shooters, I think the Bucks will handle this series."
"Wood is a 5. He’s too slow to guard wings full time.   He can switch well for a center and it’s one of his strengths but if that’s his main job, then his defense will be even worse than it is now. His best skill on defense is his rim protection  And on offense, he shoots really well but his main scoring game is facing up. And he is insanely good at that, but if he’s a 4 and facing up, it’s likely that there won’t be space inside unless the big is like Brook Lopez. And I’d hate this franchise if we chose Mobley but stuck him in the corner the whole game.   If the Rockets want Mobley, trade Wood. His value is pretty high, and then sign Olynk to a short term deal.   But I’ll take Green and keep Wood personally"
Instead you got Brook Lopez panicking in the corner and not even shooting it.
He had to remind him since players do stupid things sometimes *cough* Brook Lopez *cough*
Don't you mean *Brook Lopez corner.........* pass
Brook Lopez*
I absolutely believe this. RoLo has [talked about](https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2020/07/disneymagicmoments-nba-stars-brook-and-robin-lopez-share-some-of-their-favorite-memories-from-walt-disney-world-resort-visits/) his love of Disney and amusement parks before
Hi Bud. See Monty here? That's not Brook Lopez in the fucking corner.
Brook Lopez!
Brook Lopez back to Milwaukee!
"Brook Lopez and KLove are good, why are people hating?😂 is this just racism or what"
When did Brook Lopez get announced?
"I mean let’s be real they changed the rip to stop Brook Lopez from becoming a monster with the Nets (of course I’m not being serious but Brook absolutely abused that move, probably second to Kevin)"
Brook Lopez
Decided to leave my family in Amish country. Is Brook Lopez the greatest player ever?
Nope. It was Brook Lopez all along.
For a single season. And injuries. You really think he has no chance of being as good as Brook Lopez or Andre Drummond?
Brook Lopez played in his All-Star Nets form.
I’ve maintained since the Miami series that Brook Lopez can be the game breaker in any matchup. Too small he’ll feast in the paint if you green light him. Too big and he can step out. He won’t win you a series as the man but he can damn sure swing you 1 or 2 games.
We’re really in the ECF relying on Brook Lopez for a big performance lol fuck this season
Brook Lopez heard you talking shit
"listen newphew we're talking about his 'prime' when he was getting buckets like crazy in the post, we're not talking about 'spot up from 3 and occasionally get paint touches' on the Bucks brook lopez we're talking about the Nets brook lopez which you obviously haven't watched"
"Fantasy BBall God: Brook Lopez  He aint consistent but when he does this, you win"
"FFS did people really forget that Simmons, on his day, is a triple double machine with elite level defense?  And he's 24, not 32, he can fix his shooting. If Brook fucking Lopez managed to go from 0 made threes in a season to being called ""Splash Mountain"", I'm pretty sure someone of Ben Simmons' talent can turn himself into, at the very least, an average shooter, and that combined with everything else he brings to the table would make him worth more tham Brogdon and a first rounder which will more likely than not be out of the lottery.  Well fucking done Morey for saying hell no to this package. Sure, Simmons had a shit year, but if that is enough to turn him from a centerpiece for a James bloody Harden trade to Brogdon plus a single goddamn non-lottery pick then this sport is honestly far more idiotic than I thought.  However, if they plan on keeping Doc, they really have two options. One is to trade away Simmons, the other is to lock him in the gym until he's capable of hitting 40/100 threes and 85/100 free throws. And I'd much rather attempt the latter first because I feel Simmons is worth the effort."
"The new fans have no idea because Brook's been a stretch-5 for the last 3 years lol. I'll never forget the hype with Deron Williams and Brook Lopez, and then it got amplified with Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Joe Johnson... if that team was assembled 5 years before they did.. oh lawd"
Where can I subscribe to Brook Lopez facts
There's no easy way to market Lou Williams vs Brook Lopez
"Im here for sweet Lou and Brook ""SPLASH MOUNTAIN"" Lopez"
The best argument for Turner and Simmons is spacing. Turner is a better long range shooter than Embiid and has a faster release. You can park Turner out on the perimeter in the Brook Lopez role when he shares the floor with Simmons.
That was Brook Lopez remembering he’s the biggest guy on the court and is a francise’s all-time leading scorer haha
"I mentioned at the beginning of the season that I thought Brook Lopez was a top 10 center. His talent is hampered because he has to clear space for Giannis, but Lopez is a powerhouse"
"That’s just a notch on Brook’s belt, then.   Doesn’t necessarily speak ill of Nets players not named Brook Lopez. Dude was just on fire during his tenure there."
"This is what happens when you give the team freedom of space that isn't warped around Giannis' offensive liability in terms of spacing.   No Giannis = Allows Lopez to cut, bang down low, and move freely. Gives the Bucks a much better bail out player who also is great at FT's (for a big) when they dive to the rim. Also gives drivers much more versatility cause bigs have to worry about an alley-oop or a dump off.   Giannis, as good as he is, doesn't command that kind of presence down low..  Really liked the ball movement from the Bucks last night and Brook is showing all the nephews that he's not some scrub big who shoots threes cause he wants to.   Glad Brook is getting his roses after this game cause the man can flat out score and just chose to be a 3PT specialist to elongate his career/better fit his team  ALSO allows Bobby Crazy Eyes Portis to spread the floor as a lethal 3PT shooter who loves to get rebounds. Spacing is important, hope this gives Bud an idea of how to manage minutes and lineups in the future if Giannis somehow returns"
Exactly the sixers fucked up when they got Harris and bench players that couldn't spot up shoot. Harris absolutely can but I just don't think it's his instinct. He's more of a ball dominant offensive player than off ball. You can't have more than one dude that can't shoot the 3 nowadays with great accuracy or who's instinct is too score in the paint. Just look at how much brook Lopez had to change his game in order to stay on the court with Giannis.
"Hawks really needed that game last night, they just let Brook Lopez look like prime shaq against them"
"&gt;As much as I love getting pounded by Brook Lopez  lol, so a weird twist, would not have guessed game 5 of the ECF would have been the Brook Lopez beast mode game  also agree, I was having a blast watching these teams duke it out and adjust. it seemed to be destined to go 7 games with each team getting better and better throughout the series (fwiw it might still go 7, but a much less exciting 7)"
Brook Lopez just transformed into a Wilt Chamberlain that game. He stepped up big in this crucial big game. I believe he has a lot to show in the next game if he's still in the groove.
Finals MVP Brook Lopez***
"Not exactly, they couldn't keep Brook Lopez on the court when Trae was on fire because he was getting killed. He was only getting about 20-25 minutes a game. Minus Trae, they were able to keep him on the court for longer, which is a good adaptation. Bucks found a way to exploit the Hawks lack of their superstar, the Hawks didn't."
"Mate, Brook Lopez was known to be a black hole on offense (narrative wise). He took forever with the ball and didn’t look to pass unless he had to (due to his teams being garbage).   He atleast evolved a lot post Lakers. Became a rim protector, expanded his range, stopped being post up dominant, more team oriented   Touches / useage are still very high. Even compared with his team  (Which this is what you should have linked. https://www.nba.com/stats/players/usage/?sort=USG_PCT&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2016-17&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=1610612751 )  Can you find time of possession of ball that he had?"
"As much as I love getting pounded by Brook Lopez, yeah we are totally getting robbed of an amazing ECF series with these two out."
"If you think Brook Lopez is a goat,  wait until you see his brother."
"I feel like on some plays they can put Giannis in the corner and have brook go to work on the inside, or have Giannis cutting in and out of the paint so that Brook has that option to drop it to him. I’m not saying that should be their go to option just a few plays here and there, but they never do that. They just put brook Lopez out on the three point line it’s such a waste of his skills"
"Lopez DOES occasionally get post looks with Giannis on the floor. If you watched any Bucks games during the 2nd half of the year or during their playoff run you noticed this. It's not a go-to offensive strategy for the Bucks when Giannis is playing, however, because Giannis' defender will not follow him to the perimeter, so the paint will quite frequently be very busy. It's foolish to believe the way Brook played last night is in any way reflective of how he SHOULD play for the Bucks' offense to be the best version of themselves while he shares the court with Giannis.  https://www.nba.com/stats/player/201572/shots-dash/"
Perk is really not going to concede his idiotic Batman take...  Whatever we're one game from the Finals &amp; Brook Lopez at least for a night looked like prime Shaq.  Just need to take care of business!
"They’re gonna have to do the same thing they did the last game, actually put Brook Lopez in the paint like the big man that he is"
There is not a basketball player in the world who would fit and complete the Nets roster more than Brook Lopez right now.
Yeah don’t be a brook lopez.
"The folks shitting on Bud for “not using Brook Lopez properly” are just grasping the straws. Brook sacrificed his touches so that Giannis could get his. You can’t really stagger their minutes either, unless the Bucks get another big who can space the floor as well as Brook does with Giannis out there. It’s not as the Bucks coaching staff deliberately held back Brook for the LOLs, it was a necessary trade-off that led to Giannis being a two-time MVP."
"The 2019 world cup roster:  Derrick White, Donovan Mitchell, Joe Harris, Marcus Smart, Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Mason Plumlee, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Kemba Walker"
Brook lopez is secretly the bat man. Middleton is Robin and Giannis is Alfred. jrue is the bat mobile

I guess that confirms brook lopez is not the avatar
"I agree, I just recently started watching basketball again with the bubble playoffs. Prior to that I think I just got tired of seeing the Warriors and the Cavs duke it out each year so I kinda just stopped following the season.   This season is really interesting since I’m seeing a bunch of new players in the spotlight that I never really followed or frankly knew much about before this season. Obviously all the injuries suck but at least we are seeing others step up to the challenge. Like frankly I knew nothing about Brook Lopez before last night’s game lmao.   It’s nice to see that there’s no clear favorite to win it all like in many past years. Still hoping for my Hawks to defy the odds and make it to the finals 🙏"
"Counting stats. It's an algorithm based on previous HoF players, and the vast, vast majority of them played full careers and got to marks like 20,000 points or 10,000 rebounds. Like, if Giannis retired today, he'd have less points than Wayman Tisdale and less rebounds than Joe Barry Carroll. The MVPs and All-Star appearances can only balance that out so much.  Edit: he does have more rebounds already than Brook Lopez, which is kind of hilarious. That's playing half your career as a stretch 5 though."
"Hot take Brook Lopez has been the bucks 2nd best player in the playoffs, argue amongst yourselves"
"Brook Lopez is a great player but he got wayyy too many easy looks and second chance points. Hawks just had no good defensive scheme for much of the game, unlike Game 4. Hoping to see some better performances by Collins and Capela on the defensive end in Game 6.   This game was annoying since the Hawks kept bringing the score close enough to start a comeback but they just could not get many stops on the Bucks."
It really messes with the spacing if you have both big guys in the block.  That just mean an extra help defender against Giannis or Lopez.  But I do think they need to figure out ways to space for Brook when Giannis is on the floor.  I wonder if maybe they have Giannis cut to the rim and have Brook follow they could get some similar lob looks.  They also need to need to go to Brook whenever Giannis is off the court more.
Every time I watch Brook Lopez he's an absolute stud out there even if his numbers aren't always mindblowing

"god at least when I talk shit about Bud I use ""hey why not run giannis/khris pnr's from a side angle"" or ""add more cross-screen actions to initiate brook Lopez post ups on mismatches""  like how hard is it to do the bare minimum of actually saying anything actionable in your 100 word self post about what a coach needs to do better"
So wanting to see the best players in the league go up against each other is considered being a casual? Maybe it's just me but I'm not really running to my tv to watch Bogdan Bogdanovic v Brook Lopez. Guess I'm just a casual
" But then again if Giannis and Brook are on the court at the same time, Brook doesn’t have as much room to operate in the post because Giannis’s defender would be in the paint when he is off ball.   When Giannis is on ball, you need Lopez to space otherwise Giannis can’t drive as his own defender is already sagging off him."
Realllllly? I didn't know Brook Lopez was an elite rebounder. I also didn't know Brook Lopez could guard the perimeter so well that teams don't even try to run the pick and roll to force a switch against him.
"&gt;He doesn't have to be as good of a 3 point shooter as KAT. Just good enough in addition to his rim protection, perimeter defense, and touch around the rim. And he's not afraid to lessen his role in the offense for the team.  You are describing a Brook Lopez not an Embiid btw."
Holy Crap !!!Brook Lopez with CAREER DEFINING GAME!!!!!
"&gt; Brook Lopez showed off tonight why he was the face of the Nets in the early to mid 2010's  He was also the face of trade rumors for most of that time, too. His career arc is kinda wild."
"I hate to say it but if brook Lopez is guarenteed HOF, the hof is a joke.  The man is really good but the basketball hof is so easy to get into, compared to basically any other sport"
"Y'all love to talk shit about how Budenholzer uses Lopez, but conveniently forget that Brook was on his way out of the league before he came to the Bucks. The Bucks got him on the minimum for a reason in 2018-2019: he was considered a defensive liability and someone who just gets in the way of stars' drives on offense."
"See, there's this guy named Brook Lopez and"
I see you forgot about BROOK LOPEZ too
"He did raise the ceiling of the Dallas team , shooters like Tim Hardaway and Finney Smith was being fed with open shots . But KP man , he's so disappointing that he's afraid to post up even against the smallest player in the opposing team . If it was Lebron he would have drafted KP ass away .  Also take a look at Brook Lopez against Atlanta last night . This is how a big man supposed to play and help their main superstar . No superstar can get any chips without a proper second option , not Jordan without Scottie , not Kobe without Shaq/Gasol , not Lebron without AD and definitely not Luka who is just 3rd year into his NBA career ."
Rudy. He's been hitting 3s in practice. You never really know though. It could very well be Capela as well. It's just so hard to predict. Brook Lopez was allergic to the 3 point line during his entire stay in Brooklyn and then he became a volume 3 point shooter in Milwaukee
BROOK LOPEZ WITH THE STEEL CHAIR!
Brook Lopez
Did anyone think Brook Lopez had this in him??
"Yeah, I'm coming around to thinking no team will give him anything close to a max. I get that Trae was out, but getting outplayed by both Bobby Portis and Brook Lopez in an important playoff game is unacceptable for somebody that wants the money he does."
Bobby Brook Portis-Lopez
Brook Lopez is Batman and Bobby Portis is Robin. Giannis and Middleton are frauds. Trade em.
"There’s intrigue, and then there’s watching Brook Lopez vs Kevin Huerter to see who makes the NBA Finals"
"Like Chuck said, they talented but they stupid as fuck  They got Brook Lopez camping out on the perimeter, one of the better low-post threats in the league is being used as a glorified Steve Novak.   And its not like Lopez has forgotten how to get buckets down low, [Brook Lopez put up 25 vs the Heat](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/202105290MIA.html) in game 4 to complete the sweep doing all the damage in the interior  Budenholzer's coaching honestly can veer from good (the adjustments he made vs the Heat) to downright wtf (like playing zone vs KD/Kyrie)"
"Briannis, Brook and Robin Lopez sound like a really hot set of triplets. Just saying!"
Brook Lopez showing why he's the Nets all time leading scorer.
It ended up being Brook Lopez and Bobby Portis.
"lmao no.  It just makes Brook less effective, which is fine because I’d rather have Giannis than Brook Lopez as the main offensive option."
"Brook Lopez, King of the IZOD Center."
"It feels like people forgot Portis was literally a starter level player, Jrue Holiday is an All-NBA worthy starting guard, Khris Middleton is an All-Star caliber forward, and Brook Lopez is still capable of playing at an elite level, if anything improving his defence since he was an All-NBA post player"

We really going to act like Brook Lopez won’t be FMVP?
&gt;Bro what? People are guarding vuc on the perimeter. He shot over 40%.  I would encourage people to watch Vucevic games and how he gets treated on the perimeter then. Teams are fine letting him shoot and not bending their defense to account for the threat of his 3 point shot all the time.   &gt;Also drop coverage gets rightfully blamed when someone like brook lopez or jokic are dropping and giving wide open floaters/midrange.   The point is people's focus is excessively on bigs and never on the on ball defender and how well he fights over a screen which is a big key to drop pick and roll coverage
Is Brook Lopez more skilled than Giannis?  Unironically
Don’t need him when u got the GOAT Brook Lopez
"Nah bro, I was talking about Brook Lopez, I swear I saw in your comment Brook and not Booker"
"It's not necessarily a problem with either guy, they just aren't compatible on the court at the same time. Just watching, it really appeared they both played better when the other was on the bench.   So there really just needs to be a decision. Either way and I would ultimately be happy, or at least talk myself into it.  I just lean towards Sabonis because I like watching him more than Turner. Jokic is easily my favorite player to watch in the league and having a poor man's version of that is nice.  But I also think if Turner gets his game right, he's kind of the perfect center in the modern NBA. He could stretch the floor on offense with his shooting and provide lengthy rim protection on defense. It's essentially the same role Brook Lopez plays when the Bucks are healthy.   I guess his contract is maybe a bit bigger than how teams value that, but sometimes I really don't understand why most teams aren't constantly making offers. Maybe we don't hear about it, but the story of Danny Ainge demanding TJ Warren along with Turner for Hayward really fucked with me. There was very little coverage that said how lopsided of a win that deal would have been for the Celtics"
That would just result in Jokic getting the Brook Lopez treatment
Brook Lopez
Brook Lopez and it’s not even close
"&gt; Hack-a-Shaq is in play  How many times do people think they can foul someone? Even if you send him to the FT line on every single possetion, that'll be 53% 2P makes, then everyone on your roster would be in foul trouble and every foul would be immediate FTs.  It would also keep Shaq fresh on defense. Not only that, Shaq was getting tackled by 7-footers the size of Brook Lopez and they couldn't do anything. He would physically hurt most ""small ball 5s"" (aka lanky PFs or thic SFs)."
Nobody before the series was worried about Brook Lopez and who was gonna stop him
Game 5 Brook Lopez &gt;&gt;&gt;
Brook Lopez from last game
I really like Brook Lopez one hand dunks. He just has a way of making it flow and it’s rare enough that its always a pleasant surprise.
Why come back when you have the goat Brook Lopez
"&gt; They traded DLo for Lopez and the Kuzma pick.  Actually we traded him for Brook and Josh Hart, we didnt need to trade DLO to get Kuz"
"it literally was the entire point bro. literally. cousins is not in the same sentence as corey brewer, and that’s literally all that’s relevant here. it’s void. His point would make sense if Boogie didn’t put up monster games 24/7 in his prime. but nah, keep living in the world where ayton and Brook Lopez have already hopped Boogie I guess  It’s a semi-understandable point. But it’s dumb and exaggeratory in nature. Hands down"
Brook Lopez would still be an all star if he played for the magic no cap. They can only hope to contain him.
If you have to ask yourself how to stop brook lopez you already lost
"You don’t do anything that much different and just have to hope he misses a lot more shots in G6 than he did in G5. If Brook Lopez beats you by going 14-18, then you live with it. Clint Capela was a legit ~top 5 DPOY candidate this year so tell him to play better. The other thing you can do on offense is try to drive it at him and get him into foul trouble."
"KD was in the paint a lot, he led the nets in blocks by a mile  He is actually still 4th overall in blocks per game for the playoffs, just behind brook lopez"
Can’t take the credit. It’s just a great pasta. Also works with Brook Lopez btw ;)
Brook Lopez last night :(
"What's crazy is brook fucking lopez is like 65 years old, that dude played for stanford in the 1970s lmfao"
Exactly  Jrue has so been great this series but Recency bias got people thinking a hot game from. Brook Lopez makes him the best
1. Giannis  2. Reggie Jackson  3. KD  4. Trae young   5. Paul George  6. CP  7. Dbook  8. Luka  9. Bobby portis  10. Brook lopez  Nothing in particular order but bobby portis is #1
Did you know Brook and Robin Lopez played on the same high school team as Quincy Pondexter and failed to win a state title together?
They don't need Trae to win game 6 and 7. They just need Giannis out. Brook Lopez and Portis aren't going to score 30+ and 20+ points each night.
"Been a Bucks fan for 20 years.  Sometimes I legit feel the Bucks are a better team without Giannis...and it's not Giannis fault.  Its Bud's awful play calling and inability to capitalize on the totality of his talent.  Everyone was shocked Brook had a big game, I wasn't.  He gets lost in the shuffle because of Giannis, in the worst way possible.  Giannis over-dribbles the ball because the Bucks would rather teach him to shoot than teach him post play.  Most of Giannis plays require a clear-out with every other player on the perimeter.  This in effect neutralizes the post potential of Lopez and the aggressive inside slasher play of Holliday."
You heard it here first:  Brook Lopez FINALS MVP!!!
Us raptors fans having flashbacks watching Brook Lopez dominating the hawks.
"Both of those lineups also have no rim protection at the 5 and force Giannis to become one dimensional defensively. Brook Lopez, for all the issues that arise with his drop coverage, allows Giannis to be fully utilized on the defensive end of the ball, flying around the court.   And you’re right, me saying need was a bit of an overreaction, but Lopez is probably the best fit at the 5 next to Giannis."
"This isn't a ""big market"" thing its a ""disproportionate injury"" thing.  &amp;#x200B;  2019 was huge even when KD was out because there were familiar faces in Kawhi/Steph still playing. The WCF was bad because like... and I say this as someone who watched and enjoyed the games, the casual fans don't wanna watch a Clippers team without Kawhi Leonard. Sometimes its not about the teams location its about who you beat. If the Clips were healthy even if the suns won I don't think the WCF would have low vierership.   &amp;#x200B;  I'm gonna watch because I like watching basketball but whose really stoked to see Brook Lopez vs Clint Capela to decide whose gonna go to the NBA finals?"
I want the Bucks to win only if Brook Lopez gets finals mvp
don't you want brook lopez to get a ring?
"Y’all must not actually be watching basketball man. Yes. Those are the guys who make the difference in series, ask the hawks about Brook Lopez and Jeff Teague, or ask the heat about Brynn Forbes. 0-9 from Holiday and Middleton tonight"
Bucks have a brook Lopez problem. He’s simply incompatible with Giannis on the floor. Giannis is clearly the better 5 and if playing the 4 he needs a small ball center to play with  When they share the floor on offense Lopez just sits on the perimeter because otherwise he’d be a total lane clogger if left in the paint and Giannis needs all the room he can get there  Bud needs to adapt a clippers esque lineup and minimize aytons presence on defense by installing actual perimeter threats  And Jrue can’t shoot and is an offensive liability
Lol so many salty fans out here. I’d be sad too if my star player managed only 11 shots tonight and was not a factor at all.   When Brook Lopez hits more key shots than Giannis… big performance I guess!
Brook Lopez looked like a hippo on a slip n slide on some of those switches tonight. I’m not sure he can be on the court if either Booker or Paul are out there at this point
Is Brook Lopez getting cooked his fault or Bud’s?
"Quick Postgame thoughts:  - Suns clearly brought more energy and maintained it throughout the game.  They wanted it more.  Was this a classic Bucks low energy game 1 or is this a preview of the next 3+ games?  - The Bucks defensive schemes were a mess until late in the 3rd quarter.  We'll see in the following games they can figure out a better way to defend the midrange game.  - Drew Bledsoe showed up today.  Bucks wont win much if that guy keeps showing up.  Will Jrue make an appearance?  - The Suns played about as perfect of a game as you can expect.  Can they keep that up, or have they peaked?  - On the same token, Chris Paul has played arguably the two best games of his career back-to-back.  Can he keep that up as well?  - Giannis played okay given his injury status but he wasn't his usual self.   - Brook Lopez will probably experience limited minutes the rest of the series because he was getting absolutely cooked on the defensive end.  - The free throw difference was egregious to the point that even the milquetoast announcers commented on that.  I would expect the next game or two to tilt more in Milwaukee's favor in that stat line.  - Seeing Frank the Tank get minutes was both awesome and horrifying.    - For as bad as Lopez was defending the switch on the top of the key, Portis might have been worse.  - The Bucks will have to put a body on Ayton on the offensive end.  He had a ton of uncontested rebounds."
This is the first time I have ever seen Brook Lopez so useless in the defensive end. The phoenix guards really targetted him every time there was a switch.
"Lol feels bad for Brook Lopez, getting benched pretty much the entire 4th"
It's crazy to me Bucks got away playing Brook Lopez in the Nets series but they might not be able to get away with it here.
So is Brook Lopez not coming in again?
do you think from watching this game that the bucks were getting robbed of calls?   book has as many shot attempts in the paint as brook lopez does lol
"You can play amazing defense but when you guarding Someone one on one and he shoots especially from the 3 ?, there’s nothing you can do but let him shoot..  or the Brook Lopez foul will be called"
BROOK LOPEZ AND BOBBY PORTIS WELCOME TO YOUR TAPE
Brook Lopez is more efficient right now than Middleton. This is looking like a sweep if Middleton keeps playing like this.
The Suns offense is literally just putting Lopez in the pick and roll every time down the floor. They’re making him unplayable. He simply cannot defend Booker/CP3. They don’t have to do anything else when Brook touches the floor

As much as I think suns are gonna win. Would be nice for Brook Lopez to get a ring…dude is still our franchise all time scoring leader. Classy mf too.
"There’s no reason Brook lopez should end up on an island so much. They’re just giving up the switch so easily fight through, show hard, do something don’t just give it up."

All this talk about Giannis but I’m glad Brook Lopez got one
Thats former laker Brook Lopez
"Lopez literally went from 29 MPG, to 33 MPG, to 29 MPG, then down to 24 MPG once they started the finals  It has nothing to do with who Jokic was playing with, it has to do with how many open jumpers CP3 and Booker got because Jokic was too slow in the pnp and they exploited that, just like they started to do to Brook causing him to get fewer minutes   To your original point you are absolutely right, those players would absolutely cook on offense, but defense would be a struggle for them against teams with as much shooting/lob potential as that usa roster"
"Friendship with Brook Lopez ended, Bobby Portis is my new best friend"

brook lopez is selling rn
Brook Lopez is sabotaging
"Bad shooting selection imo. They need to stop with those early 3s and start moving the ball a little bit more to find better looks. Playing so fast is leading them to many turnovers and the Nets are a team that can willingly punish them considering how good they are in transition. So, the first thing they need to do is to slow up the tempo.   They also have to capitalize the size difference and try to put the ball at the low post more oftenly. Playing Giannis as the screener would be a nice adjustment too considering how aggressively the Nets are defending the PnR with this ""up to touch"" coverage and their continuous helping. Having a good decision maker as your roll-man will force the weak side defenders to stick to their players.    As for the defensive part, if they want to continue doing that drop coverage with Brook Lopez, they need to put players with longer wingspan like Middleton and Giannis on the perimeter to contest these off-dribble 3s. Kinda like what Utah does with Mitchell and Royce O'Neale."
"Bruh Brook Lopez went 8/11 in 27 minutes, they wont be able to put KD on Embiid or he'll foul out in 6 possessions."
"I could understand Brook Lopez part of it even though he could help with the offense Nets are successfully target him on the other side but for the Giannis part, its plain stupid"
"this bucks team is trash lol. dumbass coach, also dumbass players always making bone headed moves. the only semi-intelligent players on the bucks are jrue holiday and brook lopez. we kicked their ass without james harden lol imagine if harden didnt get injured this series would probably be 4-0"
Brook Lopez 27 min Giannis 35 min against the worst interior defense in the league they need to fire this man right now
can't really hate this bucks team tbh. They have brook lopez
IMO Brook Lopez could have went for 40 tonight but the bucks are all about hero ball. Minimal passing and all just 1 on 1. Also Blake griffin locking up giannis is hilarious
"2nd leading scorer for the Bucks, Brook Lopez, is 4th on the team in minutes. He also happens to be 8 of 11 from the field. How many other teams just don't feed the hot hand like this?"
Jrue and Middleton have to be much better going forward  Giannis and brook lopez showed up but their guards didn’t
Not posting up brook lopez on Joe Harris is an interesting decision
milwaukee players got no iq lol. the only players on their team that ctually has half a brain is jrue holiday and brook lopez

Brook Lopez should 100% be the second option this series. The Nets have no interior presence and hes always been a talented scorer. Seems like every time he gets the ball right now he gets something super easy
BROOK LOPEZ IS THE ALL TIME LEADER OF POINTS FOR BROOKLYN NETS  REMEMBER WHEN BROOK LOPEZ WAS AN ALL STAR?  GOOD TIMES

"there is a 0% chance that the bucks look panicked over the course of a 7 game series.  The bigger issue is that Giannis isn't capitalizing in the paint, and Brook Lopez is.  Needs to adjust."
free points at the rim and im watching brook lopez midrange shots
Bucks need to start hitting their shots.  Brook Lopez isn't going to always be there to clean up the glass.

"I expect the Nets to target Forbes or Pat Connaughton as the weak link in defense, like harden did against fournier.  I also expect Giannis and Brook Lopez to kill the boards."
Brook Lopez voice sounds like when someone is being interviewed on tv with the lights off and their voice changed to protect their identity
"Does nobody remember that Magic was 100% ready to trade Kuzma, Hart, Ingram, Ball, the same amount of picks, Rondo, Stephenson, AND take on Soloman Hill's contract to get AD in the middle of that 2019 season? The only thing stopping him was Dell Demps wanting to make a fool of the Lakers FO which is why he got replaced. Magic traded Zubac for Muscala (a ""stretch 5"" who was 28% from 3 that season) to the Clippers.    He gets credit for getting Lebron, but fails to go out and get shooters and instead gets Lance Stephenson, Michael Beasley, and Javale McGee (who wasn't bad but we could have retained Brook Lopez instead)."
"You're massively, massively sleeping on Khris Middleton. He averaged 20/6/5 shooting 41% from 3. They're good numbers!  I think the Bucks will win, just about, in 7 games. It will obviously be really close, I just feel the Bucks are more prepared defensively. Jrue/Giannis/Khris is such a solid defensive trio to throw at the Nets big 3, they won't lock them down but I think they can make them work.  I just think the Nets lack interior defence, and I think Giannis will end up switched onto Kyrie/Harden quite a lot. Plus,  I can see Brook Lopez could be a real issue for Blake playing the 5."
"Lopez is a great rim protector and makes no mistakes on offense other than some bad shots. You'd lose because of the rest of the team, but I think people sleep on Brook too much."
Brook Lopez is the most unguardable player in NBA history he would change everything
"Idk why everyone is acting like there’s some all knowing answer out there to stop Brooklyn. They have two of the greatest isolation scorers of all time, one of the best shooters in the league, and probably the best 3rd option in the league who had a 50/40/90 year. They’re ridiculously stacked and title favorites for a reason. There’s gonna be parts in this series where we do everything right defensively and they’ll still hit a tough shot over us.       We’re not gonna switch with Lopez, he’s gonna continue to play drop defense and we’ll switch with everyone else. Losing Donte means we lose Defensive flexibility. We can no longer close games with Jrue/Donte/Khris/PJ/Giannis and switch everything if Brook struggles. Sure we can throw Pat in there but he’s going to get abused by the big 3 too. It sucks but it is what it is. We can’t magically pull another elite defender out of our asses so we have to make do with what we do have. Keeping Brook in the drop defense gives us our best chance.       Beating Brooklyn was always going to be about taking them from an potentially all time offense to just a good or great one while exploiting a ton of their defensive weaknesses. Forbes and Portis were top 5 3 point shooters this year statistically, they’re gonna play even if they present defensive issues. Brook should be able to score at will and kill them on the offensive glass, that’s a huge mismatch we can exploit. We don’t have a lineup of the perfect players to hurt Brooklyn on both sides of the ball, but I’m not sure anyone does. We can only maximize our personnel’s strengths defensively and hope it’s enough for us to be able to outscore them. Obviously we’ll see if it’s enough but it’s the best chance we have."
How many minutes do y'all think Brook Lopez will play tonight?
Which Prime.  Brook Lopez has two of em.
"Thats ""nets all-time leading scorer brook lopez"" too you"
Nah Brook Lopez was always useful down low. Don't disrespect that man.
"I think people are really discounting the damage Lopez himself is going to do if the Nets play no true Center.  They won’t have anyone who can guard Giannis or Brook on the inside.  And if you play Clayton and DJ, both those dudes make it easy to play Brook. Heck, even if Bruce Brown is on the court you can play Brook on him like he’s a center."
"It's interesting how the NBA has evolved. Sure, Gobert is a liability but even guys that have a more complete game can be a problem. Take Brook Lopez for example. He is the type of center you want in the league. Someone that can spot up for threes, but that can also offer an inside presence on D. Yet the Bucks at several times were better with Lopez on the bench. But that doesn't explain a guy like Embiid. Someone with a similar all around game but a must need to have on the floor. I guess there are only a handful of bigs that are not a liability but most of them are."
"He wasn’t sitting in the paint except for when they tried 2-3 zone a handful of times where that’s literally what he is supposed to do. And they didn’t rotate at all when they were covering man on man. You can see Joe Ingles literally flat footed and starring at Mann while hugging Morris on some of the highlights of his threes on here.   The issues with the Jazz were they’re unathletic and slow on the perimeter if they’re not just small. Gobert had to cover for that on drives by coming off his guy sitting in the corner because it was either a three or an easy lay up, and the Jazz just let it be an easy three every time.   Just because you have Brook Lopez suck for his reasons doesn’t automatically mean that’s why Rudy got shat on."
"Props to the clippers for making the open shots and not giving up at halftime, they deserve to win the game. But this comeback is on the Jazz coach Snyder.  Keeping Gobert in the game for so long as the lead slipped away due to open 3 pointers in the corner from Mann or Batum on just about every possesion....  It's a baffling decision and I don't understand why the Jazz didn't match up with a Conley, Mitchell, Clarkson, Bogdonovich, O'neale lineup. If Conley couldn't play that many minutes in his first game back then play Ingles instead.  The clippers didn't play Zubac hardly at all in the 2nd half, so there was no need for Gobert's rebounding and rim protecting. Even if the Jazz guards gave up contested lay ups and 2 pointers, that would be a more difficult comeback for the clippers than giving up wide open corner 3s.  Just about every clipper highlight from the 3rd quarter is Mann or Batum hitting a 3 pointer with Gobert's outstretched arm barely in the frame.  Moving forward, the Jazz need another impact player off the bench who can play the 5 in against other team's small ball line ups. (A Robert Covington or Draymon Green type of player.) Or a big man who can stretch the floor a bit on offense at the very least (A Brook Lopez or Marc Gasol type of player, though preferably someone a little younger.)  The Jazz have a good team, they just don't have a flexible line up to match up against other team's playstyles. Compare them too... the Clippers, who have players like Cousins, Zubac, and Rondo. They have Morris, a guy with decent size who can stretch the floor. Reggie Jackson and Luke Kenard who can stretch the floor and give a spark off the bench. All players with a specific skill set that is useful in certain matchups and specific situations."
"They are a good team, but this series exposed that they do not have a good small ball line-up, specifically for defense. They more depth off the bench and should make 1 or 2 roster adjustments (but preferably both).  1. A big man off the bench that can rebound on defense and space the floor on offense, while still offering some decent rim protection. A Brook Lopez or Marc Gasol type of player. (Though preferably someone younger if they can.) This player would swap in for Gobert when teams play small, because Gobert has no post game on offense which makes him a liability in these small ball matchups. 2. A wing player who can guard the perimeter and also play the 5 against a small ball lineup. A Draymond Green or Robert Covington type of player. Someone who can close out to the 3 point line, but also hustle and get rebounds."
Maybe if we had Brook Lopez. When you have a center with as high of a usage rate as Joel Embiid you need a stretch 4
"Mitchell Robinson is American, but he got hurt this year I thought. Brook Lopez was on the World Cup team in 2019 so I could see that"
"Brook Lopez did. But Blake increased his FT% by his 4th year. Both Lopez and Griffin were never afraid to shoot, and neither were terrible shooters.     &amp;#x200B;  I don't think anyone becomes a significantly better shooter after 5 years."
"Ehh I’d say the most likely explanation is that it’s really really really fuckin hard to just add these new wrinkles to your game at a professional level. Especially a jump shot.   I think a lot of fans are acting like it’s 2k where you can just upgrade at will. Real life, hard work doesn’t always pay off (especially at the professional level) and you can still hit a wall hardddd. Especially when you’re training to be effective and maintain energy on both sides of the court allllll season long.   How many guys have actually worked on and successfully started to shoot above league average like Brook Lopez did?"
I just don't think he can hold up in the post vs some of the bigger European bigs and he doesn't play very physically. I guess I just would rather have a more traditional sized big. I mean Draymond is gonna be on the team so feel like him and Bam are locks. To pair with them I think we should have a traditional big to matchup with some of the bigger Euro teams.    As for his defense I also just don't think he's much of a rim protector either. The team will have enough scoring and that's his best skill.  For example I would prefer Brook Lopez if he's interested (no idea if he has ever shown interest or not).
Brook Lopez
"Centers have been our downfall in general since the Kobe Era.  Mozgov - no explanation needed  Then we went on to draft Zubac, Thomas Bryant, and Mo Wagner, all of whom are at least passable, and could do the job of keeping AD from getting banged up at the 5. Failed to retain any of them.  Got Javale Mcgee, Dwight Howard, Brook Lopez as free agents. Brook especially could've been such a huge difference-maker for a healthy Lakers team. A center who can space the floor along with LeBron and AD would've been so great. Failed to retain any of them.  We've managed to hold on to some great forwards, including maybe the greatest ever, we've had passable guards, but we've failed time and time again at the 5."
Brook Lopez seems totally perfect
"Brook Lopez, Embiid, Anthony Davis."
Wouldn't you rather watch Brook Lopez
I'm waiting for the Brook Lopez China memes

That Brook Lopez possession is the worst thing I've seen after JR Finals mistake. Coach Bud is an idiot.
Man Brook Lopez not knowing the shot clock is such a choke
Fucking Brook Lopez sleeper agent ass
"I can’t believe that bucks possession with 8 secs to go with 2.1 on the shot clock. Only option really is to have a chuck and pray from Middleton and they’re forced to inbound to brook lopez. If they lose, they lost on the little things"
Brook Lopez was in the goddamn huddle talking about the play and then he got the ball and didn’t know what to do. What the fuck? Lmao
Fucking Brook Lopez seem to never know the shot clock I swear. It happened quite a few times this series.
Brook Lopez with the Jr Smith level dumb ass play
"That last Brook Lopez play will go down in infamy for Bucks' franchise. I said it throughout this game, but the low IQ of this team is jaw-dropping. Just absolutely staggering.   There's dumb, there's dumber, and then there's the Bucks."
Brook Lopez just cost them the game holy shit bro
If brook lopez literally knew how much time was left in the shot clock its probably over too

"I’ll agree to disagree here. I’ve watched lots of hawks games this season (Trae young was huge for me in fantasy until he and half my team got injured lol) and they were definitely underrated going into the playoffs. But I’d take a core of Giannis Middleton and jrue anyday. Brook Lopez, pat and PJ are also great role players to have. I’ll admit hawks have more depth tho (with hunter and bog dan out y’all still had Lou will and K’Von show up big.)   If we’re only looking at talent on paper I give it to the bucks 100%. I’ll give you guys credit tho. If we’re only looking at talent sixers would have won too. Nate McMillan really rallied this team after a poor start and your guys look hungry. So honestly even with the talent gap that I think exists, I’m riding with the hawks. Watching the Bucks during that Nets series pissed me off so much lol. I think people are forgetting how poor the bucks looked against the Hospital Nets only because they won in the end. Series should have been over in 6 for the bucks once kyrie went down. Their offence looked lost out there. If Jrue continues to struggle to find his shot I think we’re about to see Trae Young in the finals which would be amazing considering all of the undeserved hate he’s gotten"
Brook Lopez made the team??
Brook Lopez
"Bucks are better when brook lopez fills the Giannis role on the team. Better 3pt shooter, better defender, better ft shooter."
How dare you disrespect international superstars *checks rosters* Jae Crowder and Brook Lopez
As a lakers fan i knew Magic Johnson was a trash basketball executive when he actively threw Brook Lopez off the team so we could sign Javale McGee. Brook wanted to comeback too 😔
The 2008-2009 Nets shipped aging Vince Carter and rookie Ryan Anderson to the Magic in a sorta changing of the guards thing. Nets went from the Carter era to the Brook Lopez era and won 12 games in 2009-2010.  *To a similar extent after the Bulls ditched their dynasty Phil Jackson rallied some guys to join the Shaq/Kobe Lakers.
"Supposedly Nets offered 5 1sts and Brook Lopez for Dwight. This would’ve given the Magic the future that Celtics would end up having (plus some bc we could’ve flipped Brook)  Also for Dwight the Thunder supposedly offered Ibaka and Harden, if Harden developed the same way he did in Houston, then gg. Also the Thunder with KD, Russ, and Dwight would’ve been scary.  To Chris Webber, I feel even though Shaq and Penny were a scary duo, Shaq and Webber may have been scarier. Furthermore if we would’ve kept the picks we got along with Penny, and made the right picks, we could’ve added Vince Carter, and Kobe/Nash.  Supposedly Doc wouldn’t let Tim Duncan fly his family, causing Tim to not sign with the Magic. Maybe if he does, Grant Hill doesn’t carry as much of a load, and the big 3 leads to great things."
"I’m worried for giannis man, I’m doubtful he’ll have his full athleticism if he does play, and he would be a poor decoy, he can’t shoot from the perimeter and would clog the paint for brook lopez. Im also worried about him reinjuring his knee more. I hope he proves me wrong and comes out strong and truly is healthy."
So it won’t be 90 straight Brook Lopez post-ups? Shaq and Chuck are in shambles
some of my favs:  * Splash Mountain -&gt; Brook Lopez * Maple Curry -&gt; Jamal Murray * Girth Nowitzki -&gt; Nikola Jokic
"Brook ""Lurch with a 3 point shot"" Lopez."
"Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez, Raul Lopez, Raul Neto, Raul Ibanez"
"If I know Atlanta sports, you guys win tonight, lose game 6 on a Brook Lopez buzzer beater, and then get blown about by 40 in Game 7."
I've been wondering all season why we didn't stagger Brook and Giannis a bit more so you have a great post scorer on the floor at all times.  Thing is Lopez is a smart player so he could definitely do great damage with Giannis cutting to the rim
If a random person watched Brook Lopez for the first time tonight they would've thought he is the GOAT
Lakers screening legend Brook Lopez
"MVP has to do with team record, supporting cast and a lot of luck throughout the season. I think Giannis is an MVP level talent on any team in the NBA due to his own ability. Dame is an MVP level player. He just never won it. There's a difference there. What you said earlier is implying that Brook Lopez is doing what Giannis does throughout an entire regular season to the tune of 60+ wins because of Bud's system. That is beyond ridiculous."
"Brook Lopez and his caveman looking ass has been fucking the Hawks ever since he was a Brooklyn Net. I wouldn't be mad to never have to see him in the playoffs again.  Also, seeing Holiday routinely rob our ball handlers really makes you appreciate how good Trae's handles are"
Brook “Wilt Chamberlain” Lopez
"Can't believe I'm watching Brook Lopez and Bogdan Bogdanovic duel it out, not on a load management game on a weekday but for the Eastern Conference title"
Brook Lopez what the actual fuck
"Am I back in kindergarten, when Brook Lopez was the foreseeable future of the Nets?"
"What are you talking about? This was absolutely without a doubt, one of the basketball games we've seen this playoffs.  Jokes aside, Trae Young is much more integral to Hawks' offense than Giannis is to the Bucks' and it showed. Not sure how the Hawks can bring this back. Even when Brook Lopez and Bobby Portis Jr aren't popping off, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday are much more consistent scorings options than anyone on this Hawks team. I just don't see a good answer from the Hawks to the Bucks dominance in the paint either."
"Brook ""Bill Russell"" Lopez."
Brook Lopez is Batman and Middletown is robin
Brook Lopez in the post was amazing. He's just so much bigger than everyone and having him there allows him to get better positioning for the rebounds as well.
"Score one for apocalypse bingo: Brook Lopez dominating the game and leading his team one game away from NBA Finals.   Seriously though, massive respect to Bucks front office for identifying players like Jrue Holiday and Bobby Portis to acquire in the last couple off seasons that have become the X-Factors to them going beyond their previous heights even without Giannis."
Brook Lopez sounds like if Patrick Star was a human instead of a cartoon
I think it says a lot about budenholzers system that brook lopez could step up and basically play like giannis
"Gallo's daughter was wrong, Brook Lopez is the leader with Giannis gone lol. But for real tho, didn't expect the Bucks to win this given the last game. Guess they were better prepared. It's a good look. I just want whichever team will have their star healthy by the finals at this point tho lol. I hope this goes to 7 to maximize those odds."
Bobby Portis and Brook Lopez looked like prime AD and Boogie on the Pelicans
Apparently Brook Lopez just found out he was 7ft today
why does brook lopez sound like he just huffed a bunch of Sulfur hexafluoride
Brook Lopez out of nowhere with the folding chair
Remember what I said about Capela.  Brook Lopez just did what I was saying.
Brook Lopez voice legit sounds like he took a huge whiff of Sulfur Hexafluoride damn lol
"""See Clint Capela, the numbers don't lie, and they spell disaster for you at Eastern Conference Finals.""  –Brook Lopez, probably"
"I was really confused since people were saying that the Bucks’ best player wouldn’t be playing this game, yet Brook Lopez was on the court?"
"Lol, I don't give a fuck, I want the Bucks to win the title even if they don't have Giannis. What's crazy is, I think they might be able to do it if they can contain CP3. I'm not sure who can defend him better than Jrue Holiday.  Brook Lopez/Jrue Holiday/Khris for finals MVP, fuck it"
"My boi Brook Lopez finally. Was a fan of him and had him pegged as the next TD early in his career, but injuries and being traded constantly derailed that. Love me some good Brook Lopez game."
Brook Lopez replicating the G.O.A.T. Post Hook from his lil bro Robin.

Brook Lopez woke up this morning and remembered he's a foot taller than everyone else on the court
"That's Brooklyn Nets All Time Leading Scorer, Brook ""Kareem Abdul Jabbar"" Lopez to you heathens"
Of all the things that could happen this series I didn't think Brook Lopez being a superstar was one of them.
They really made Brook Lopez look like Shaq
I still got hawks in 7 if Giannis doesn’t come back brook lopez isn’t gonna get 33 again
Brook Lopez is wholesome. He seems so cool
The day Brook Lopez &amp; Bobby Portis brought tears to Milwaukee.

Brook Lopez showed off tonight why he was the face of the Nets in the early to mid 2010's
"End friendship with Giannis.  Brook ""The Hook"" Lopez is my new best friend."
"Brook Lopez went old school reverting to his big man role, scoring 26 of his game leading 33 points in the paint -- where the Bucks dominated all game scoring 66-36 down low exposing the Hawks lack of size with Capela only able to play 21 minutes.  The Hawks never showed enough energy or urgency tonight and look like they were ready to get back home to have their crowd behind them."
"Brook ""The Spanish Freak"" Lopez"
Bobby “Crazy Eyes” Portis and Brook “More than just three-pointers” Lopez are quite the big duo.
"Even though we won, I want to fire bud.  Why did Lopez have an amazing game today? Because we were forced to adapt due to Giannis being out. Bud had him switching on defense, and playing inside the paint instead of sitting in the corner to shoot 3s. Both of these things could've been implemented while Giannis was also playing with brook.   But we pretty much only use brook to shoot 3s to space the floor for giannis, and absolutely never waver away from drop defense unless we make Giannis go to center and bench brook.  Criminal mis-usage of brook Lopez from bud until now."
"**BROOK ""GIANNIS"" LOPEZ**"
"33-year-old Brook Lopez: Playoff career high 33 points on 14/18 shooting, 7 rebounds, 4 blocks, 26 points in the paint.   Middleton: 26/13/8/2/1 on 50% shooting in 35 minutes  Holiday: 25/6/13 on 45/38/80 shooting splits, 13:1 assist:turnover ratio  Portis: 22/8/3/3 on 9/20 shooting   Tucker: 11 boards, a steal, an assist and quality defense in 37 minutes  Team as a whole: 11 steals to just 8 turnovers   What a fantastic effort by the starting lineup, in what was basically a must-win, with no Giannis."
Brook Lopez showed off tonight why he was the face of the Nets in the early to mid 2010's
I almost didn't watch this game. Thoroughly enjoyed watching Brook Lopez and Bobby Portis go off.
Brook Lopez: I’m going to be Giannis for today.

The Phoenix Suns are in the finals and Bobby Portis &amp; Brook Lopez are dominating an ECF game.   I need to lie down.
CP3 vs. Jrue Booker vs. Middleton  Ayton vs. This Version of Brook Lopez   even without Giannis that’s a solid matchup for both teams. Would be a fun matchup either way
"Brook ""Nets All Time Leading Scorer"" Lopez"
I guess brook lopez is a volume scorer now

Brook Lopez is really dad dicking the Hawks in the ECF lmao wtf

Hawks might have a better chance at this game if Brook Lopez didn't suddenly decide he was Giannis
God am I glad the Bucks stole Brook Lopez off the New Jersey Swamp Dragons.
Brook Lopez slander is no longer tolerated
Hawks fans gonna have PTSD from this Brook Lopez.
Brook Lopez legacy game?
Who would have thought Brook Lopez of  all people would be the Bucks saviour
Turns out Brook Lopez was Batman and Bobby Portis was Robin this whole time.
can we all agree Brook Lopez looks like he’s a cousin of Justin Timberlake?
I was doing some work and just turned the game on.  Did someone fuck up the score sheet or has Brook Lopez become a god?
I've never seen someone enjoy watching their teammates play as much as Brook Lopez right now.
I did not expect Brook Lopez to be the reason Milwaukee might end up in the NBA finals

Brook Lopez playing soft ass hell
Why the fuck is Brook Lopez playing right now?!  SMH
Brook Lopez doing all he can to lose this game.
Bucks have like 3-4 plays a night where it’s just one pass to Brook Lopez for a 3-pointer. Awful.
"Honestly the pull on the rim might've been goaltending wish we got a replay.  But that Brook Lopez oop was goaltending, clearly"
"Chris paul was missing all of these shots he's making, and Brook Lopez was making his, that's kinda the difference between a bucks blowout and a suns 5 point lead"
"It was definitely over the cylinder, but it was clear that it was a lob to Brook Lopez. I'm not sure I like that application of the rule."
Brook Lopez aside this is tied. Great game so far
Brook Lopez had like one great game and everyone was overhyping him af
Thank fucking god Brook Lopez is putting the team on his back...
"Brook Lopez is unplayable against this team. I know Bud is limited in options, but he can’t keep playing him."

Brook Lopez with the green light with 20 secs left in the shot clock. WTF?
"Brook Lopez loses his head damned easily for a 33 year old that's been in the league for 13 years.  He goes on tilt, and suddenly he's a whirling dervish of unnecessary fouls and 3s with 20 left on the shot clock.  Come on, dude."
Brook Lopez get off the floor and put Portis back in
Rough sequence for Brook Lopez.
Still havent seen Brook Lopez actually make a 3 this series
"I love Brook Lopez so much but this series just very much does not play to his strengths. He isn’t a threat attacking off the bounce or defending a drive, and that’s sort of the two main things that teams that beat us are good at."
Brook Lopez 3s cause Van Gundy physical pain

"Can I just say how much I love Brook Lopez?  Guy can do everything.  No ego, just a great all-around teammate."
I’m okay with a Brook Lopez game
Shout out to Brook Lopez. His defense on Ayton has been perfect so far.
since when did brook lopez become a good rim protector

Brook Lopez pulling up his Nike socks to his calves doesn't sit right with me
Brook Lopez has come along way from being Yi Jianlian's backup.
Brook “Splash Mountain” Lopez is overdue for a flurry of 3 pointers…. ESPECIALLY at home. I’m calling 6 3s by him. Or 0 points on 0-9 shooting. Could go either way for my man Splash Mountain
"Their starting 5 are all either elite or above average on defense, they’re an elite rebounding team, and jrue is a former all star and khris is an all star that can have superstar takeovers, giannis is giannis, pj has hustle and physical defense and is the best corner 3 shooter, and brook lopez can space the floor as a big man with the 3 ball and good defense. then u have guys like pat that go crazy from 3. Offensively and defensively combined they’re pretty damn good"
That's Brook Lopez
*Brook Lopez and Patrick Connaughton nod their heads in agreement*
1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. Thanasis Antetokounmpo 3. Kostas Antetkounmpo 4. Brook Lopez 5. Robin Lopez
"It’s not dumb at all. The bucks were missing their regular shots while the Suns went apeshit in the first quarter. After that the Suns offense was bad outside of Booker and wide open Ayton looks because of Defense on booker   Here’s a summary of bookers makes in the 3rd   1. Step back make on pj off a screen  2. P&amp;r jumper off ayton screen 3. Contested shot after Middleton was playing great D  4. Contested jumpshot on PJ (pj fell to floor, so he was open momentarily after having to go through PJ) 5. Contested left hand layup vs brook lopez  6. Double teamed, passed the ball to payne and had an open uncontested layup   4th quarter   1. Step back on jrue  2. Contested and one layup  3. Reverse layup vs jrue  4. Drove past Giannis, layup  5. Fadeaway contested  3 on Jrue   Keep in mind the rest of his misses were contested shots and that the bucks held a double digit lead   If you go look at the Bucks makes, most of them were wide open looks or within the flow of the offense outside of Khris having some MJ mode in him   TLDR:   🤷‍♂️ had Booker not been hitting all those contested hard shots, that game was a blowout because the bucks had a way easier time scoring"
"I think you're counting Brook Lopez as a **RECENT** all star due to his only All-Star appearance in 2013? That appearance would be entering the 3rd grade, LMAO."
"The Bucks have the coolest team. Giannis is just the epitome of likability, its impossible not to like him with that babyface and accent. And just story in general. Middleton is calm and collected, doesn't get a lot of attention, but has always been underrated. Jrue, one of the best wing defenders in the game, has gone through a lot with his family and the scares earlier in his career. He worked so hard to get where he is. Brook Lopez, one of the biggest nerds in the league. PJ Tucker, the shoe junkie. Bobby ""punch Mirotic in the face"" Portis. Pat Connaughton, ""the most athletic white guy ever."" Yeah, I like this team."
"Yeah, made the playoffs this year fun as fuck. I knew he’d choke and the offense would collapse when it mattered, but his crunch time performed this year was so, so much worse than even I expected. He was genuinely bad in crunch time in 3 close losses, against a team that let Brook Lopez hang 33, really impressive stuff"
"Here is an attempt at putting the article here. There are videos with surrounding text so I cut those and the surrounding text. Sorry if some of it doesn't make sense.  One trend that has perhaps been underdiscussed in these always-evolving NBA Finals: The Milwaukee Bucks are one win from the title in large part because their offense has been really, really good.  The Bucks in the Finals have poured in 117.7 points per 100 possessions, a mark that would have edged the Brooklyn Nets for No. 1 in the regular season. The ugliness of some of Milwaukee's meandering half-court possessions obscures how lethal this team can be when it gets rolling.  The easiest path to that is to not play in the half court at all, and a big theme in this series has been Milwaukee's ability to get out in transition. The Bucks aren't running quite as often as they did in the regular season -- when they played in transition more than any team, per Cleaning The Glass -- but they are still doing so at an above-average rate, and that's a win considering the Phoenix Suns were among the very best at keeping teams out of transition.  And the Bucks are scoring just about every time they hit the open floor: 152.9 points per 100 transition chances, according to Cleaning The Glass. The No. 1 team in the regular season by that measure finished at 133.8. Yowza. This is one of the subtler ways Phoenix's lack of size hurts. Deandre Ayton is the only guy in the Suns' rotation even resembling a big man, and he plays near the rim on offense -- meaning he is rarely back early as a deterrent. No other Sun can make Giannis Antetokounmpo at full throttle pause to think for one second.  The Suns have been a little lax with their floor balance and ball control, but the Bucks are opportunistic; they hunt transition chances with constant urgency.  Behind some hot shooting and smart adjustments from Mike Budenholzer in Game 5, Milwaukee's half-court offense -- its weak spot in past playoffs -- is up to about league-average production for the series, per Cleaning The Glass. The Bucks doing that against one of the league's nastiest half-court defenses is almost cause for a parade.  Milwaukee brutalizing Phoenix on the offensive glass has boosted that half-court scoring figure by turning some initially listless possessions into points. Milwaukee has needed all this offense, because the Suns have scored 115.5 points per 100 possessions -- a hair below their sixth-ranked figure in the regular season. Their effective field goal percentage for the series would have ranked No. 2 behind the Nets; it bumped even higher over Games 3, 4, and 5 -- all Phoenix losses. Phoenix is shooting the bejesus out of it.  The Suns have had to, because, as I noted before Game 5, the Bucks have methodically turned this series into a math problem the Suns can't win. The possession battle is a rout for the Bucks. They are getting more offensive boards and free throws. And their defense is scrunching the Suns' offense toward the midrange to a dangerous extreme. Phoenix is getting to the rim at a league-worst rate, and it has attempted just 30 corner 3s -- six per game, down from its regular-season average of 10. Seventeen of those 30 came in Game 2. In the four other games, the Bucks have basically erased the corners from the court.  It's great and not super shocking that Phoenix is shooting so well; the Suns consciously built around two elite shot-makers in Devin Booker and Chris Paul. It's not great that the Suns have to shoot well -- and almost preposterously well -- to have any chance to win. The Bucks have a margin for so-so shooting; the Suns don't.   Starting in Game 3, the Bucks have found the right mix of defenses to make the Suns uncomfortable. When Brook Lopez is on the floor, the Bucks play a slightly more aggressive version of their base pick-and-roll defense: Lopez ventures out to deter an easy jumper, but not so high as to approximate any sort of trap. He has mostly been able to stay in front of Booker and Paul, and then pivot back to Ayton in time to meet Ayton outside the block-charge circle -- forcing tough hooks and floaters.  The Suns might be able to find traction getting even more creative with where Ayton sets his picks -- sometimes close to midcourt; sometimes at the foul line. (Ayton is also smart about flipping the direction of his pick at the last second.) Booker might benefit from more instant head-down driving, and less pulling back to map the floor. Regardless: Lopez has hung in since the Bucks ditched Game 1's switch-heavy gambit.  When Lopez is off the floor, the Bucks switch everything. They don't seem all that concerned with handing Booker or Paul the Pat Connaughton matchup both are seeking. An adjustment in how Milwaukee's other four defenders react when the Suns get Connaughton on an island is one reason the Bucks have flipped the momentum in these Finals.  One Milwaukee tweak was to stop switching with Lopez. Connaughton at least has a shot of sticking close enough to Paul and Booker as to not require emergency help -- or at least not inspire the fear in his teammates that such help might be required.  It's easy to say Phoenix should spice things up instead of getting bogged down in isolation basketball: keep moving, set more ball screens, run split actions off the ball (when two teammates screen for each other and veer off in random directions), and continue with its sets as if facing a normal defense and not a switch-everything vise grip. The Suns should do all those things!  But elite switching defenses have a way of squeezing that verve out of you -- of making all that motion seem pointless and exhausting.  Milwaukee's offense has had euphoric ups and troubling swoons in the Budenholzer era, including in these playoffs, but its defense has been constant. If the Bucks have a mediocre scoring night after a sizzling first five games, that defense might be good enough to carry them across the finish line."
"Bucks lose:  “Is Giannis the least skilled MVP ever?”  “Fire Bud, he’s made no adjustments ever”  “Jrue Bledsoe hurr hurr”  “Middleton is the least consistent player. All he does is chuck”  “Why did Brook Lopez even get x minutes in the playoffs? Giannis should’ve played C for 48 minutes”"
"It was brutal. 4 of our starters were in a contract year and some bench players as well. In that year we became really good and all those guys earned major pay-checks.  Predictable the Bucks fucked it up and signed Bledsoe with the highest priority. They actually did it before the playoffs.  Honestly as much as I like Lopez, I wasn't sure about that contract. We could have signed Robin for 3 years on a super cheap deal instead of paying much more for Brook. Since he is not playing the most important minutes anyway it wouldn't have mattered as much.  That would potentially have allowed us to sign somebody else, but I don't remember what FA there could have been."

Bad time to have Brook Lopez in. KD is going to call for a screen and go to the midrange on almost every possession.
Why didn’t Brook Lopez try to go for that. He put it all on connaughton who was boxing out hard. I’ve seen that lack of next level hustle all games. Can’t assume your teammate will get it and not go for it.

Shaq once called brook lopez the best center in the nba after brook dropped 25 on him in a preseason game
"Jokic without his passing would not be much better than prime Vuc/Lopez, maybe better than Brook Lopez I guess but Vucevic can certainly match no-pass Jokic  Jokic's passing and playmaking is what elevates him to an MVP level player, while those 2 even at their peak at at best All-Star level bigs."
"I think that if you ask my daughter this question, and she is 7 months, she is going to give you the right answer: Brook Lopez and Bobby Portis."

Shaq and Chuck's take on this is so 1990s.    Would you rather have Brook Lopez in the paint scoring or would you rather have Giannis in the paint scoring?  You can't have both.
Brook Lopez is the true batman on the bucks
"As a long time Net Fan(NJN), it's not a surprise what Brook Lopez did in the first half. What's surprising is it took an injury to Giannis for Bud to switch up the gameplan. Brook's post game is elite, it's sad to watch him camp on the three point given his skill set."
I wasn't looking at the numbers.. I just know fucking Brook Lopez and Bobby Portis we're going off.
This game is a great reminder that Brook Lopez is the all-time leading scorer for the Nets.  Also shows how he's been mostly wasted as just a 3 point shooter all offseason.
"You also have three players shooting what feels like 100% from the field, Jrue Holiday is clamping multiple players already, and you're even getting fantastic defense from Brook Lopez. I think this is realistically the most you can ask for out of these guys."
How are we only down 9 with the greatest player of all time Brook Lopez going off
lol. Brook Lopez played like Prime Kobe and you're whining about 50/50 balls and refs.
Chuck is gonna have an orgasm at halftime because Brook Lopez is finally playing in the paint

So many apologies to Brook Lopez have to be made
Brook Lopez looking like Shaq rn bruh
"Brook lopez   Jokic passing skill is what make his life easier for him to post up, he doesnr have stone hand and have great vision to be double teamed to my knowledge"
"Nets Brook Lopez lmao. Jokic’s passing is what makes him Jokic, all 3 are elite post scorers."
Because every team Brook Lopez is on has someone who gets a shitload of rebounds.  This is not a coincidence.
Brook Lopez is like the Walmart version of Blake Griffin that’s the Dollar General version of Brook Lopez

Nets legend Brook Lopez

"Bucks Big Three: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Brook Lopez, PJ Tucker"
"What did you think of this 1rd and 2nd Bucks vs Nets?   For me Nets better   Bucks not playing well but Grego and Brook Lopez well   Greek doing it right exploiting the Nets' defense   And Lopez right on the perimeter   For me it was cheap 6 PTS of difference   To the side of the Nets   Harden even limited by injury playing smart digging fouls   KD very well and I think Giannis has to score him on the 3rd or 4th because KD has had an advantage over Pj Tucker although he is a good defender"
Giannis is paying great tonight. Drawing fouls left and right and converting 4 of 8 free throws. Shoutout to Brook Lopez. 12 points.
brook lopez is the 2nd best player on the bucks honestly. dude is awesome
Pretty bad day when Brook Lopez has been your best player
Wtf brook lopez is the nets all time leading scorer?

Brook lopez Sounding like a dinosaur lmao
Brook Lopez is so stupid
Does brook Lopez know he’s tall???????
Does Brook Lopez know he can post up aa smaller player?
This Brook Lopez drop coverage hurts my soul
Brook Lopez has the body of Mrs. Doubtfire
Does Brook Lopez have any of his Brooklyn era post game left in him?  Is it like Spongebob when he emptied his mind of everything except fine dining....and breathing?
"At some point, don't you pull Brook and go with a slightly quicker lineup?   Lopez is playing Gobert, just giving up an easy look if the Nets want to go after him"
Anybody remember when Brook Lopez use to average 20pts as a low post player for about a decade?
This brook Lopez lineup is god awful
"Well, I'm nervous!  But either way, I've made my peace with the outcome.  If this is the end of the road for this season, there's still a potentially healthier next season, plus I'd root for Brook Lopez to get a ring.  But, neither team has lost at home yet this post-season, so I'm hoping that trend continues despite the injuries and fatigue!  *Let's Go Nets!*  **BROOKLYN!!!!!!!**"
"I think they're talking about Brook Lopez' rebounding being lacklustre, not Gobert"
"Gobert gets paid 200 million dollars. He’s expected to carry his team on atleast one end, if not both   Instead he doesn’t do shit because the other team does what every team in the playoffs has done and abuse his obvious defensive flaws every series   Gobert plays like a worse and slower brook Lopez on defense with none of the offense  Quit blaming role players for not making a 200 million dollar players job easier"
"Bam, 6'9"", got cooked by 7 footer brook lopez because thats a mismatch and the Heat had no one else to cover him, and Butler is not big enough for guard Giannis. This is such an oversimplified take. Butler and Bam are elite on defense."
"Imagine getting eliminated by the same team in the first round three years straight.  Giannis star help? Middleton who is all right but streaky and injured Brogdon, Eric Bledsoe and Brook Lopez? Man, you must not watch Bucks much."
Bam and Butler is way overrated on D. Bam got torched by Brook Lopez and Butler could not stop Giannis.
"Yeah whoever wins tonight is who I’m rooting for in the east. Not a fan of the sixers, and I just like Giannis more than Trae.  Also fucking love brook Lopez"
Gobert for Brook Lopez. Probably makes the Bucks worse tbh
Brook Lopez
