"Problem with Lukas 3 ball is he creates his own shot every single time with a slow ass stepback into a long 3. He needs to play a bit more off the ball and try and get a kick out from Hardaway or Burke. Thing is whenever Hardaway handles the ball he gets tunnel visioned and almost always drives for the layup and when it comes to Burke, him and Luka are never on the court together. Luka would really benefit from having another high IQ guard on their roster like a Kyle Lowry or a Chris Paul who could help produce for him."
"Imagine being Blake Griffin.    You're drafted by one of the worst organizations in the history of the NBA. A racist owner, horrible team management, team players themselves hating everything about organization, the whole 9 yards. You're Blake Griffin, however, and you do your best to put this organization on the map.    Griffin redshirts his 1st season due to injury, and in his 1st official season in the NBA, he wins ROTY and gets into the All-Star game as a rookie. You've turned this franchise around in just your first real season playing. The next season, the team capitalizes on your success and acquires Chris ""Point God"" Paul, and you and the team continue to have arguably successful season after successful season. Consistent playoff berths for one of the worst NBA organizations of all time for the better half of a decade. Their biggest downfall was just not making serious headway in the playoffs, with consistent First/Second round exits. That being said, you can't say those weren't successful seasons for the LA Clippers, considering their storied history.    At the end of the 2017 season, Blake Griffin had been expecting some sort of contract extension. He was, afterall, the face of the franchise for the better half of a decade. Blake Griffin wasn't expecting the biggest extension, heck he realized his own position at that point in his career, and was willing to work with the Clippers and compromise on a contract. When he walked into the extension, the Clippers had set up their room with various global icons, implying that Griffin would be an icon for the Clippers. Clippers employees wore custom made shirts featuring Griffin's face along with historic icons such as Obama, MLK, Gandhi, and Mandela. He was told that, as difficult as the times have been, the LA Clippers were committed to Griffin's future to the team. So according to Griffin, this was his team of the future. He was the face of the franchise, and he was offered a max contract from the get go. Of course, you accept a max contract, no matter who it is.   Just the next season after, approximately 6 months after the extension, the LA Clippers trade Blake Griffin to the Detroit Pistons for Tobias Harris, Boban Marjanovic, a future 1st and a future 2nd. Talk about getting your back stabbed by one of the worst franchises in NBA history. Not to say that the Clippers did the wrong thing, we have all seen how Griffin has declined since his 1st Detroit Pistons season, but it's how they did it that makes them the bad guy. The LA Clippers didn't have to lie to Griffin like that. Sorry Blake, you deserve better."
"I actually don’t believe that assumption, it is just a common narrative in the media when ball dominant players link up. Maybe it’s just so they had something to talk about, but the media loved the push the narrative that the inability to share the ball would be this teams end.  I remember that same narrative was widespread when Chris Paul joined the Rockets everyone was quick to call them a failure due to people believing 2 ball dominant guards could not be successful, when in reality they worked amazingly off of each other (Albeit CP3 did have to give up more here).  So far these 3 on the same time have worked out offensively just how I thought they would with Harden taking a lead play making role, but there are still clearly plenty of shots for all 3 of them to go around. There real problem IMO is defense and if they do not learn to gel better defensively they are going to have some trouble in the play offs.  Also not insulting at all, I appreciate the feedback!"
Chris Paul keeping the mid range alive.  I didn’t know KD favored the left midrange  so much.
3 certainties in life:   Death   Taxes   Chris Paul middy
Chris Paul.  Jesus fucking Christ he’s 35 and 5’11.
"John Wall- favorite player. He never got called 'loyal', despite playing through the days of Washington being the league's laughingstock. Looking at the team's playoff wins in the last decade, they only have one victory when Wall didn't play at an All NBA level, and he missed that game after busting his hand a few days before.   Derrick Rose - he's been one of my favorite players to watch. Absolute dynamite! His untimely injuries caused a major blow to the Eastern Conference, and he sadly won't be a Hall of Famer, but I hope he at least gets a ring.  Chris Paul - the point god. His career really speaks for itself, but a ring would cement his legacy   Bradley Beal - I think it's kinda funny to see people hop on the bandwagon during the last two years. Before 2016, he was often called an injury-prone bust, and couldn't really do much as an on ball threat, because of a lack of dribbling ability. I've loved seeing his evolution as a player to the point that he's averaging over 30. He and Wall were my favorite duo in the league too, and once Beal became the team's best scorer, Washington had their best season.  Russell Westbrook/Damian Lillard - I have them here for similar reasons. Russ' effort level is incredible, and quite frankly, I always felt he overachieved instead of the opposite.  Dame keeps Portland in the fight year after year, even when things are far from ideal. Can't ever really count them out.  Honorable mention: Mike Conley, Jimmy Butler Isaiah Thomas, Carmelo Anthony, LaMarcus Aldridge, Paul Millsap, Paul George, Al Horford and Kemba Walker"
and they wouldn’t let kobe get chris paul 😂
&gt; We actually beat the Rockets 3x without KD...  Remembers the day they were close to go home with a chris paul-less rockets.   Kd gave the warriors the possibility to be unmatched every single game against every single team. They were so chill everygame because they knew that they were going to be 1st seed and they were going to win it all
"Now adjust for pace and different league rules governing defense. Anyone can play that game. Your opinion isn’t in the mainstream because it’s wrong. If you count what Isiah accomplished ring counting or ring chasing, that’s absurd. He was the best player on multiple championship teams that beat Magic’s lakers, Bird’s Celtics and Jordan’s Bulls in the playoffs. Some of those series were won due to heroic performances from Isiah. That stuff matters. Just like a stacked clippers team led by Chris Paul choking a 3-1 lead to the rockets matters."
"Clippers pretty solid, Chris Paul with his pre-injury athleticism and post-injury IQ and savvy plus prime Blake and DeAndre are nigh unstoppable on the PnR"
"Well to answer that question, I think any team that has to rely on drop coverage is a great example. It doesn't matter what center you put in drop coverage, whether it's Jokic or Gobert, we see those defenses get torn apart come playoff time. And that's not necessarily that centers fault, it's the fact that poor defensive guards can't fight through screens well enough to stick to their man, and leave a ridiculous 2 on 1 task to their big man every play. Gobert's defensive value in the playoffs goes from top 3 in the league (when looking at one number impact metrics) to slightly above average. Now obviously drop coverage is a specific example, but a bad defensive guard can completely erase the impact that a dominant big man has. That's why Kyle Lowry is so valuable for the Raptors, and why Gasol was able to roam and play the way he wanted to. Same with basically any big that played with Chris Paul"
"Lebron def didn't dislike his game. He was going to watch Steph play when he was at Davidson. Even Chris Paul used to mentor Steph in some of his camps. They just didn't expect Steph to go super saiyan in the NBA and become arguable better than them in the case of Lebron, even if it was for a short period of time. And in the case of CP3, Steph just surpassed him. Although I still believe CP3 is the better all around player, the impact of Steph's shooting is just too ridiculous."
"Mike Conley. People forget this man was part of the Grizzlies roster alongside Marc Gasol that made the WCF. Plus he had to play against Steph, Dame, Russ, Harden (when he played PG), pre-Lakers Steve Nash, Chris Paul, and many more. Never had a shot of making the All-Star team, until this year. I would say his name and Donovan Mitchell's name (but I had to do only 1 Jazz player) at the top even if I wasn't a Jazz fan.  Honorable mentions: Dame, Giannis, Al Horford, and Paul Millsap."
Chris Paul and Westbrook
"little selfish, but demar derozan, LaMarcus Aldridge, Keldon Johnson, dame, chris Paul"
"Chris Paul, Westbrook, Harden, Paul George, and idk um Embiid"
Chris Paul hasn't been out of his prime since 2014. He had actually had a better year in 2015. 2018 was probably the last year of his prime where he was still a top 7 player.
Surprised Chris Paul never had a 54pt game.
DeAndre Jordan got to play with Chris Paul for the entirety of his prime.
he has got extremely unlucky over the years   2007 vs spurs with the amare suspension or 2018 chris paul injury
"Maybe, Chris Paul is up there too"
C'mon man Chris Paul great player and unique playstyle could have a million nicknames and he goes by CP3
I started appreciating Harden after chris Paul left Houston
All thanks to Chris Paul lol
"Off the top of my head, out of players who drive from the perimeter at a high volume, Giannis, Harden, LeBron, Zion, and Durant all have SIGNIFICANTLY higher finishing percentages at the rim for their careers.   If you want to keep it to just guards, Steph Curry, Harden, Ja Morant, Chris Paul, and Bradley Beal all have higher finishing percentages for their careers.   Kyrie doesn’t get extra points because his shots look pretty."
"Korver is 6'8” isn't he?  Again... Steph's size is going to become an issue. John Stockton is about the only small guard that I can think of that played well into his late 30s.  Chris Paul might be setting up to do the same, but he's built differently than Steph."
"Never came close? Multiple seasons averaging 17/14/3 steals with elite shooting splits for a 55 win team is not MVP caliber? Stockton did that 3 times. Steve Nash won 2 MVPs averaging 19/11/1 steal by the way. I think Stockton meets the criteria of having MVP caliber seasons.  Chris Paul was the best player on his own team, up until he had another MVP caliber player on his team. Same situation as Stockton. Don't penalize him because Malone was on his team for his whole career."
Chris Paul just makes teams better there is no way around it
"I mean, you're using that argument right now? It's an absurd logic. Why didn't you cite Darko Milicic or Adam Morrison instead of Iggy to be even more hyperbolic?   Chris Paul and IT are/were both all time great PGs, perennial all stars, and the best or second best player on their team for their whole career. It's perfectly fine to compare their ability to win rings because they are comparable players. But you probably knew that. You just wanted to pretend like I'm making some absurd argument about how rings &gt; all. Context matters."
"Kareem has less FMVP than Magic. Magic has 3 &gt; Kareem has 2.  And you say more rings completely ignoring the fact that Kareems last 3 rings came when he was 37-41, playing 15 mins a game averaging 12 points. On a team led by Magic.   Please explain to me how the 1988 Lakers ring in which Magic won reg season MVP and finals MVP,  while Kareem barely played makes Kareem the better player that year?  It's like saying Gary Payton is a better point guard than Chris Paul cause Payton got a ring with the 2006 Heat as a veteran who barely played."
The spurs gave Pau that contract because he opted out and was going to take less money if we could get Chris Paul.
"Lol why are you acting like every game wasnt close durant or not, the entire series was decided by less then 6 in each game. It could have went either way and Chris Paul not playing like garbage in 5 out of 6 games would have changed it. Just admit you didn’t deserve 2018 and move on"
"he's been giving us a chance for 8 years.  we put some really good teams around him, including at least 3 (2015/2018/2019) that were better than this team.  but he usually ran into some combination of a 67 or 73 win warriors teams or superteams where stars joined up like the KD warriors and lebron/AD lakers.  after 11 years in the league i'm sure he was done with ""just give them a chance, and by chance we mean we can win 53 games if you score 35 ppg and drag them to the 2nd or 3rd round and then lose to a team where multiple prime hall of famers joined together while you hope russell westbrook doesn't forget how to play basketball or chris paul doesn't have the worst-timed injury of all time.""   it would be nice if we didn't live in a superteam world, but at some point you get tired of hearing ""just give them a chance"" when everyone else is forming superteams."
"Yeah I mean [this is really what it comes down to](https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612742&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;PlayerIds=204001,1629029)  2021:   Luka+ no KP: 115 offensive rating +2.3 net   Luka + KP: 111 offensive rating -3.8 net   KP no Luka: 100 offensive rating -22 net   2020:   Luka no KP: 119 offensive rating +6.5  Luka and KP: 118 offensive rating +4.3  KP no Luka: 118 offensive rating +9.8  Tough scene for what's now Latvian Anthony Tolliver. The entire conception of the team and its path to success is built around KP being an all star level player. There's too much hand wringing about stuff like no Seth Curry when in reality Luka+no Seth last year basically had the same offensive rating as otherwise. Guys are missing spot ups that will probably be hit at a higher level as the season goes along but the biggest thing is unless Porzingis is better none of this really matters this is basically a 37-38 win team this year if KP doesnt get back to form.   The Carlisle Luka rotations are weird but they got lucky last night Monty Williams has also been weird about some of his Chris Paul rotations and how they keep doing this no CP3 no Booker lineups.   &gt;I know Luka gets his teammates involved, but in these clutch scenarios, he’s some times just too “passive.”  This happens alot and one thing ive noticed the past 2 yrs is how much fatigue plays into it. He's often just gased at the end of these games and I think that's relevant as to why his clutch situation %s arent so hot."
Your are comparing future first ballot HoF Chris Paul to my guy Facundo. Give him time he'll be at nba level in a year or so.
"Westbrook has shot 46 for 164 (28%) in the final 5 minutes of playoff games that were within 5 points, including 8 for 52 on threes.

"His numbers are definitely down to start the season, and having watched the games I think a lot of it is learning how to play alongside Chris Paul.  He seems to not want to overstep and try to ""This is my team"" him in any way so he's...I don't want to say hesitant but it's like you can see he's overthinking."
Chris Paul for Doncic who says no
Imagine not having Chris Paul and Devin Booker on your team
"He’s not better that Giannis, Kawhi, Gobert, Jimmy Butler or AD right now. Then you want to talk about “generation?” Alright, he’s not better than Gary Payton, Garnett, Iguodala, Chris Paul.   Those are off the top of my head. If I looked it up, I’d find a dozen more at least as good as Draymond. He’s a good communicator. He’s benefitted from small ball that allowed GSW to run big guys off the floor. He’s 6’6”."
"Don't forget Chris Paul, SGA, McConnell... even Luka depending on how they choose to slot him."

"Wood over Capela, but Wall over Paul? No thanks. I love the way John Wall has been balling out for Houston, but Chris Paul was, and still is a better, smarter player."
Good thing you put the age in there or we wouldn't know Chris paul wasn't a rookie
Chris Paul always does this to us. The only times we beat his teams is when he is fucking hurt lol
For most players the midrange is an inefficient shot but it’s not for Chris Paul lol
Chris Paul going to play until the end of time
It’s more than that [he gets bigs to lose track of him in transition and sneaks pull up 3s when they have their back turned Prada wrote about it last year](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/2/27/21153046/chris-paul-oklahoma-city-thunder-transition-genius-stalking)
My favorite point guard chris paul
We got outscored by one point in the clutch. If we were shit then the Suns were only one point less shitty.  I'm really not worried. Tonight's loss sucked but we actually looked good. Suns can't depend on chris paul to shoot 110% from the field every night; we just got unlucky that tonight was his best game of the season to go with one of Luka's worst.  It's sports. There's variance.
He is just allergic to the line and his ballhandling is meh. Ricky Rubio made Nikola Pekovic make a lot of money and gave Kevin Love his best years. Chris Paul is point guard. If he hasn't been learning how to get involved offensively with them it isn't a good sign.
Chris Paul
"Ref baiting, mainly. And he whines so much it makes Chris Paul look amicable.   Great player though."
Yeah it should be on a game to game basis though. Like this game was tight and we need a win. 35 year old Chris Paul played the whole 4th but Luka didn't wtf lol
Chris Paul was so fucking good tonight
I fucking hate Chris Paul bruh
i think chris paul missed maybe 3 mid range shots in his entire clippers career
Chris Paul couldn't miss in the second quarter. holy shit.
Chris Paul why ;-;
Not hard when Luka is defended by Mikal Bridges and Chris Paul isn't.
"Chris Paul/Mike Conley old man guards starting for the west, please."
"NBA TV says ""Chris Paul showed trust in Booker""  This is like saying Robin shows trust in Batman"
"Chris Paul looks pretty good for someone who's ""washed"""
chris paul was boutta cry lmao
Why the fuck does Chris Paul hate us?
Rick Carlisle should be arrested for making Porzingis switch onto Chris Paul over and over again.
"*It's late at night. Jada Crawley is lying in bed, asleep. The door opens, and a silhouette that looks vaguely like CP3 appears in the frame.

There's no replacing the real Chris Paul, just like there's no replacing State Farm.""  *Chris Paul walks in.*  **CP3:** ""What the hell?

Man I hate Chris Paul but he’s so freaking clutch. Makes it even more frustrating to watch him play
How is KP nowhere to be seen on that Chris Paul miss. He basically let the guy go past for an easy look and then didn’t make any attempt to crash the boards
Chris Paul has been legit tragic at layups for a while now lmao
Chris Paul isn’t even the best pg right now
I feel so bad for a Chris Paul
PG-Chris Paul SF- Lebron James This 2 Are lock
Remember 2 years ago when Chris Paul was apparently the worst contract in the league?
How is Chris Paul doing this god damn
Chris Paul been making a living roasting bigs on the switch for a decade plus
Chris Paul with a nice 29 pt game so far
Chris Paul
I’m so tired of Chris Paul lol
Chris Paul is nasty
Chris Paul looking like he is in his prime right now
luka is already better than chris paul ever was.
who is supposed to be guarding chris paul this is hilarious
chris paul best washed player i seen in my life
Chris Paul bruh come on
We’re playing well but Jesus Christ Chris Paul what the fuck
Wish we had someone who can stop Chris Paul.
Can Chris Paul just not?
Chris Paul stop pls
Sometimes there's a bunch of pretty good prospects but no obvious all-star talent.  Look at who else was drafted 2-10 in those years. You'll get some good role players or #2 guys but rarely an MVP caliber player gets taken behind the Kwames and Fultz's.   Bogut over Chris Paul was considered debatable at the time though. I think the Bucks drafted for position and Bogut was a legit center. But CP3 was widely considered the most NBA ready prospect
Would the warriors have a title if Chris Paul could stand on 2 legs in 2018?
Chris Paul can always get a bucket if necessary especially in mid range
Chris Paul is an elite shot creator...
Chris Paul is definitely an elite shot creator from midrange tho. Especially in his younger days. He could get that shot whenever he wanted.
Yeah that’s my biggest concern. To be fair Chris Paul isn’t either but he found ways to put the ball in the hoop. I could see Haliburton putting up like a 18/5/8 type of line on a nightly basis. I don’t think he’ll ever be a top 5 superstar. But very few are anyways.
Chris Paul  Joe Johnson All Time
"You mean Chris ""[Nut Puncher](https://youtu.be/i9SUoe9Tzi0)"" Paul, right?"
"It's always like this, last season he started pretty bad and everyone was already saying the Chris paul trade was the worse of all time, then he started averaging like 30 on good efficiency for 3 months. Unfortunately he got hurt and covid and now everyone seems to forget about that"
I don't think you know what you're talking about. Chris Paul played every game of the Warriors vs Rockets series in 2019.
But Chris Paul to the Lakers was denied ??
"Chris Anstey went 18th, C.J. Bruton, Paul Rogers and Ben Pepper went late in the second round."
Chris Paul
harden literally had to win one game against a injury decimated warriors without chris paul in 2019 and they could have made the finals.  he is also a part of the historic 0-27 choke job and even lost to SA without their best players  harden has definitely not been as good as his regular season self in playoffs this is a fact  harden did well to challenge warriors super team but he still has to prove he can get it done post season before you can even think about ranking him ahead of KD
"Makes you wonder who is a better player, Pippen or Chris Paul? Hard to judge. Very different skillsets."
"nbpa and 40 mil or no, i dont think chris paul as a 35-36 year old wants to do another year on a young team. If he wants a chip BKN is the move, dude already made hella bank"
"Chris Paul denies player option, signs with BKN on vet min. BKN signs Drummond to vet min, Dinwiddies returns from injury. Imagine that   James Harden  Kyrie Irving  Joe Harris  Kevin Durant  Andre Drummond  Bench mob:  CP3  Dinwiddie  Bruce Brown  Blake Griffin  Claxton     the dankest timeline"
"Look at how ingrained hustling is in Chris Paul's game. Before the ball even makes it TO the 3 point line, Paul is chasing it for an offensive board lmao."
"Probably Chris Paul tbh, since he’s the oldest besides Bron  Of the rest of those Butler will probably age the worst, but he’s still only 31"
And Chris Paul had the worst year of his career that year
"That’s the implication we were bound to be a loser without Chris Paul which is just lacking context. We were going to be solid whether Chris was around or not, he just took us to another level"
He had Chris Paul in 2019.
"Doncic + Jokic  I think they have insane ceiling, so if they’re in their prime I’m gambling that these two are great players considering we haven’t see it yet.  Same can be said for Embiid, and while we’ve seen Chris Paul’s prime and we know he’s a top tier player, I think Chris Paul is greater for his consistent greatness than his peak."
Remember when Chris Paul to the Lakers was stopped by the League? Where's the league intervention on this?!?
And Chris Paul couldn’t go to the Lakers.
"CP being short is kinda the point.  Edit: Oh, you mean Chris Paul"
"&gt;	Hou frankly wanted KD to go off even if he did so rather efficiently.  The rockets forced Durant to isolate because he’s too stubborn to be a secondary option to Curry (which he was *anytime* they shared the court together). This is something he has admitted. Guess what it did? It took a chris paul hamstring injury for them to pull through because *curry can work with or without the ball*. Kevin Durant cannot.   I think the teling story is that Durant is what we call a “system” player. He can’t create at a high level, can’t be a primary ball handler, can’t get out of traps and doubles, can’t win at all *unless he has an all time great guard creating for him*  It sucks because Durant could have proved himself in Brooklyn but now that harden is there he’ll once again evade the responsibility of being the primary option"
"Well he didn’t have Chris Paul, that’s why he lost"
Chris Paul is not going for that floater at the end of game 5. I’m taking a long two and icing the game that way instead. His hamstring isn’t snapping on my watch.
"Man, so he's saying that he had a player on his team who was a better scorer than *Michael Jordan.*..AND he had Chris Paul....and he STILL didn't win a championship? Phew."
"Wasnt it Fertitta that forced the trade through? Ik Harden didnt get along with CP3 that well and he definitely OK'd the trade, but it didnt sound like he was actively trying to force chris paul out like tilman"
Spurs with Vuc would likely be giving up a few picks in the 15-20ish range.  You're not getting any all-star level players there.   Same reason a team like Phoenix would give out picks for Chris Paul - to compete and avoid another losing season.
"no player except griffin over 6'7 has failed to try at least one dunk this season let that sink in  shooting 37%, free throw rate down to 3.1 per game, 0.1 bpg, damian lillard is averaging more, and he's listed generously at 6'2 trea young averages more too, listed at 6'1 Chris Paul, aged 35 and listed at 6'1, is averaging more. all 6'3 and 120 pounds of stephen curry is outrebounding blake   advanced stats indicate that he's below replacement level this year. safely below meaning that a random G league guy would be better than griffin atm"
"Let’s not allow this dubious accomplishment to distract us from the fact that Chris Paul is 0-5 in the Skills Challenge. Future redditors will debate his ability based solely on this, so it’s important that we settle things here."
""" Chris paul tryna beat me up"" will never not be funny."
That might have been the most improbable event to ever happen in the all-star game. A nearly 36-year-old Chris Paul caught an alley-oop? After he just threw an oop to Steph Curry a couple plays prior??
"It’s super easy, watch:   3) Chris Paul"
I love how curry knows. He glances over sees dame lookin at the basket and just puts up his arms.   That sequence where Dame Curry and then Chris Paul hit alley-oops and Dame and Curry traded from half court will forever be one of the best memories I have an All-Star Game
lol at the way chris paul whipped his head around
He doesn’t have Chris Paul or steph
"Man... Chris Paul is a ball hog, wouldnt even let Luka bring the ball up the court lol"

"Harden and Chris Paul also said basically the same thing. I bet it's a players union thing, and they don't want the league to mandate that everyone get it. It'd be a bad precedent for the union from a negotiations perspective, so they need their leaders to at least maintain that it's a personal choice.   Is it good for America and the fans and for people treating them as role models? No. It's bad. Is it good for the strength of their union and their leverage with the owners? Yes."

"They still had worse teammates. If you remember Chris Paul was once on the Pelicans, and Kemba made the playoffs twice in Charlotte."
We just saw NBA players miss wide open threes and chest passes and Chris Paul smoke a layup. I agree that they can make it slightly difficult but no one wants to watch a three minute run just like no one wants to watch a dude miss a dunk over and over again.
"We can create a really simple argument for Mike being better than DeMar and Shai. We can say DeMar and Shai are better offensive players, but not by that much. Whereas Mike is a far far superior defensive player, so much so that he becomes the better player.  Or we can have a more implicit understanding that Mike conducts one of the league's best offenses. So despite what DeMar and Shai contributes individually, they'd never be able to replicate or contribute to the league's best offense, much less be IN FUCKING CHARGE OF IT.  Something a lot of people on this subreddit don't understand is how fucking difficult it is to control the pace of the game. LeBron does it, Lukea does it, Chris Paul is a fucking master at it. Mike Conley is literally one of the best at controlling the pace of the game, and it is vital and so difficult to quantify it's importance other than number of possessions, because it's number of possessions you wanted versus number of possessions you played into. It's honestly not something I can explain adeptly and it's rarely even acknowledged on this sub, that controlling the game is literally what Mike does and many of us can't understand it."
"So would you say Donovan Mitchell has top 10 player potential since he’s leading the Jazz to the best record in the league? What about Devin Booker? Personally I think Beal is and will continue to be better than both of them, but your logic would place them ahead of him in terms of ceiling, correct? Is Paul George a top 10 player? No way he leads a team as the number one option.   I agree he probably isn’t capable of being the guy on a championship team (although look at who he’s played with throughout his career...he hasn’t benefited from playing with all around great teams like others have), but I still think you can be a top 10 player and not be capable of being that guy. Melo was top 10 for years and never good enough to be that guy. Neither was Chris Paul. I’m cherry picking players but you get my point."
"The Bubble was huge for the Suns. We barely missed the playoffs of course, but if we don't go 8-0 like that, who knows if Chris Paul still wants to come play for the Suns.  We barely got an invite to the Bubble just for it to change our trajectory entirely."
"New Orleans Hornets. You know, the team that had Chris Paul before they renamed to the Pelicans.  I could have made that more clear I suppose. You didn’t have to be a dick about it."
"Harden is pretty much a pg since he was traded to Houston. I’d classify him more as a point guard than a shooting guard.   Westbrook had better individual seasons and team seasons under his belt than cp3. I myself would choose Chris Paul, but I don’t think everyone would (and I wouldn’t blame them).   Kyrie is an oddball, he definitely has a weaker case, but I’d rather have this year’s Kyrie on this nets team than the best version of Chris Paul and that’s why I would put them in the same tier (instead of strict rankings).   Dame is definitely the better offensive player between the two but you’re right, it’s not enough for now to offset the difference in defense yet."
Lol what. 2008 and 2009 Chris Paul blow any version of russ out of the water
Chris Paul was easily there best player that series and missed 2 games you are delusional   Now let’s watch russ lose in the first round and have a sub 50% TS 3 seasons in a row and then get carried to round 2 by harden to put up 17 and 4 on 40% TS  Foh lmao
"Lol no. Chris Paul is exponentially better in the playoffs, I don’t care if he lost the ball once"
Chris Paul isn’t perfect but he’s far closer to it then russ lmao
Dude is a rockets fan and probably thinks Chris Paul is the reason the rockets are where they are right now or some shit
"&gt; The answer to most of these questions is: by normalizing his statistical output against that of the rest of the players in the league—which is how these stats are calculated.  That is useful for comparing him to the rest of the league, but not for isolating HIS impact on another statistic -- namely the winning percentages of his teams -- vis a vis other potential factors. You are not addressing the question at hand: how do you isolate Chris Paul's impact on the winning percentages of his teams versus OTHER VARIABLES within that team's structure/coincidental factors, not versus other players or teams in the league.  &gt; The answer to the influence of different coaches, and to a lesser extent the issue of other players joining the team at the same time (because, again, you can calculate their influence) is: you repeat the experiment with different mixes and see if the result is the same.  What experiment?  &gt; The experiment of sending Paul to a new team and seeing if that team improves has now been performed five times, with consistent results.  No. This is not the case. The variables were extremely different in all cases. An experiment, properly structured, changes only one variable, to whatever degree possible. It would potentially be possible to run a regression analysis of numerous factors and determine where Chris Paul's impact lies on the R-squared, but it is virtually impossible to account for all these properly and normalize them across the various situations, because each one is so different.  But, again, you are diving into statistics when the question is one of basic logic: just because something happens coincidentally with something else, it does not imply that those two things have a causal relationship.   &gt; This is post hoc, then post hoc again, then post hoc again, then post hoc again, then post hoc again, ergo proctor hoc.  Again, no, the variables were different. But even if they were the same and the above were true, it STILL would not imply a causal relationship. That is not how causality works. Just because the sun comes up in the east every day when you look out your window in the morning does not mean that your looking out your window in the morning CAUSES the sun to come up in the east, no matter how many times you watch the sunrise.  This is basic stuff."
"Lol it is Chris ""Point God"" Paul and it isn't close like at all"
rondo is a fantastic player but it's chris paul
"The answer to most of these questions is: by normalizing his statistical output against that of the rest of the players in the league—which is how these stats are calculated. Methods for calculating results for individual variables in noisy systems are some well-studied and understood mathematics.  If you’re actually interested in the math, and not just pedantically invoking intro-level stats and saying “but, like, how can we really *know* anything, man?” then you can read about the calculations here:  https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/bpm2.html  https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ws.html  The answer to the influence of different coaches, and to a lesser extent the issue of other players joining the team at the same time (because, again, you can calculate their influence) is: you repeat the experiment with different mixes and see if the result is the same. The experiment of sending Paul to a new team and seeing if that team improves has now been performed *five times*, with consistent results. The new coaches and teammates have varied each time. The constants have been: Chris Paul, improved win%.  This is not *post hoc ergo proctor hoc*.  This is *post hoc*, then *post hoc* again, then *post hoc* again, then *post hoc* again, then *post hoc* again, *ergo proctor hoc*."
"It depends on what you value and how you play. Their added value is different. I’d take Kyrie in a team like nets or 2016 cavs over Chris Paul any day, but I would prefer cp in a team like last years OKC or Kyrie’s Boston teams. That’s why I said he has an argument, it’s just not easy to compare these two players directly even though they’re both point guards. You’re right about durability though for sure."
"I think the okc one doesn't do justice because that was a .300 team after blowup of Westbrook and George, the team last year would be kind of like what we see today.  They went from Westbrook team to sell everyone for tank. But they got Chris Paul who is the anti tank god and got them to the playoffs.  That was the biggest accomplishment from bringing a trash team to a playoff team."
Remember when Chris Paul joining Kobe was an unfair advantage?  Pepperidge Farm remembers.
Chris Paul injury in 2018 so that both him and Harden would have a ring
Not even sure he’ll be considered the top 5 between the active point guards right now. Steph and Harden are easily better than him in all time list. Kyrie and Westbrook have both cases against Chris Paul. Dame and Luka are very promising to pass him as well.
Phx certainly.  A Chris Paul led team surrounded by 3 and d wings might still win 50 games if healthy in a normal season.
Chris Paul injury  Pat Bev deciding to ever pick up a basketball
"Honestly I would have a tough time saying/agreeing with Steve Nash over Chris Paul.   Watched both of their careers, and CP3 brought more overall to the table IMO. I would have him over Stockton too. Probably in the 3-4 range"
"Cool, how do you control for other variables that coincided with, preceded, or followed his joining the team? For example, did other players join at the same time, or did other players leave the team at the same time? What about coaches? What about other staff? How did the rest of the league change relative to the teams Chris Paul joined? Just curious how you've corrected for all these variables. Or are you just assuming everything else in the league was exactly the same except for the fact that Chris Paul changed teams? In which case, why?  &gt; A claim that Chris Paul wasn’t responsible would require some extraordinary contradictory evidence.  I didn't claim this, that is a false assertion. I said there is no way to know to what degree Chris Paul ALONE is responsible for these increases."
TIL Chris Paul is good. Wait...
Chris paul put the rockets over the top in 2018 though. Harden deferred to him a lot in crunch time against us. Probably why cp0 made those comments about dudes wanting it more and yelling in his face in crunch time like wade to lebron in 2011.
[You know you would change it as well](https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/chris-paul-injury.jpg)
We had an MVP thread a few weeks ago and I said Chris Paul should be in the  MVP conversation and they all went mental.
"Those people are dumb. It’s most *valuable* player, not best player. And even if it was best player it still wouldn’t be that undeserving. What Chris Paul is doing now to teams in terms of increasing their win percentage Nash did on steroids. He took the Suns from 29-53 to 62-20 in a single season. That’s a .402 increase in win percentage. That first MVP was absolutely deserved. The player scoring the most PPG does not always have to win MVP for it to be legit, Nash was truly the most *valuable* to his team. They would have been trash without him. You can argue the second MVP might not have been deserved, but the first one should not be a question."
"&gt;  They've easily been one of the better teams since.  Except in the playoffs. Tough to make a list of the best teams in recent years and put a team that hasn't made it out of the second round even once on it. It's entirely possible the Clippers don't make it out of the second round this year too. Hell, between the Jazz, Suns, Clippers, Lakers and Nuggets, one of those teams isn't making it out of the *first* round. Maybe more than one if Portland or Dallas show out.   The Clippers have been great in recent years at getting a top 3 seed in the West, but that's about all you can really say about them. And to your point about this all being due to Ballmer, the Clippers started this run under Sterling once David Stern gifted them Chris Paul. Everything you see now has directly flowed from that."
chris paul george
Chris Paul
"No, they’ve been discovered. They’re called things like: individual statistics relative to league average, on/off data, net rating, etc. We have an absolutely huge sample to help us assess his contribution: 37,157 minutes. There is no mystery here.  His career win shares (a statistical estimate of the number of wins contributed by an individual) is 186.7, the 12th best ever. His career box score plus/minus is 7.4, the 5th best ever. And that’s all averaging 34.7 minutes a game, essentially all of them as the primary ball handler. So when someone points out that every team he goes to immediately improves, we can be extremely confident that it isn’t a spurious correlation. A claim that Chris Paul *wasn’t* responsible would require some extraordinary contradictory evidence."
Chris Paul deserves a ring so bad lol.
I was looking up MJ + Lebron all time career advance stats and randomly noticed CP3 is hanging in there with them everywhere.  PER:  MJ #1  Lebron #2  Chris Paul #9  .........  Winshares/48:  MJ #1  Chris Paul #5  Lebron #6  ...........  VORP:  Lebron #1  MJ #2  Chris Paul #7  .............  Box Plus Minus:  MJ #1  Lebron #2  Chris Paul #5
It's adorable how much he cares about outplaying Chris Paul.
Suns went 8-0 in the bubble before even getting Chris Paul.
Chris Paul is due for a championship
Chris Paul George
"Hm yes, Chris Paul is good. Quite. An astute observation my good sir"
ROFL. This is hilarious. The Thunder were projected to be terrible last year...except people forgot that Chris Paul is a much better player than Russell Westbrook.
I still think Chris Paul was robbed of the 2008 MVP award.
"🙄 Yeah, if only there were other stats demonstrating that Chris Paul directly helped those basketball teams win more games..."
"Well with Chris Paul in the game they don’t go on those runs. We lost game 7 at home by 9 without CP  lmao @ thinking 2018 iggy was anything more then a defensive role player which is exactly what LRMAM was, while being the better shooter"
"Who [did it better PG or Bruce](https://go.nba.com/bw9r)  When I say that Chris Paul is clearly meaningfully worse than he was even 3 yrs ago regardless of what the counting stats say this is what I mean. One of the best ISO players and at creating separation vs anybody in the NBA for years, none of that is there the same way it was at all even 3-4 yrs ago. It just wont show up/matter alot in many matchups."
"He might be good, this Chris Paul guy."
"He was referring to a tweet he sent out years ago, which is when he brought up the Thunder fans getting mad about things, and then talking about how (hopefully) Thunder fans questioned that original uproar after seeing Chris Paul run their offense last year.  ""Thunder fans, when you saw Paul running your team with limited talent last year, did you have moments where you were like 'Oh okay this is what it's supposed to look like?'""  He's very specifically talking about their entire careers, too.  Chris Paul is almost unquestionably better in clutch situations than Russ is, even when you include Russ' awesome MVP seasons."
Chris Paul on one leg: [Literally winning a playoff series](https://youtu.be/F7XPb0hlXAk?t=5680)  He had a hamstring injury in the 1st quarter and had to go to the locker room. He came back and tweaked it again in the 3rd. He came back again and took over.
Chris Paul George  Playoff CPee
What idiot is taking russ over cp in the clutch lol? Chris Paul is almost always going to make the calculated play while russ is going to do the opposite
tldr;   chris paul good
No the main thing that works against gobert is midrange because he sinks off the pick so much. Murray murdered them with it in the playoffs and for a recent example chris paul did the same this week.
"Lol we were up 39-22 in game 6 after first and 61-51 at half. In game 7 we were up 15 at half. Chris Paul playing wins us one of these two games, come on now.  Iggy is irrelevant considering LRMAM was also out"
"This is why I have more respect for people like Chris paul, in comparison to some stars who put up good numbers but have off years with bad teams, I think players like Chris paul are always improving the team so they never have situations where its cp vs the world  I also think lamelo is going to be underrated rn but I believe he will have similar effects to his team as Chris paul  that is in terms of elevating everyone else"
Definitely dont agree that theyre a tier below the lakers but to be favorites over the nets they'd need a pretty big addition like a Chris Paul or PG.
Chris Paul ez lol
Chris Paul
"Westbrook is a losing player at this point in his career.  The Rockets were better with Chris Paul, and if Westbrook had gone to the Suns, I say they would still be a bad team."
Love Chris Paul appreciation posts.  He's a true superstar and may go down as the greatest point guard without a title (hopefully that won't be the case).
"Chris Paul is a leader, unlike kyrie irving"
"As a Suns fan who is loving having Chris Paul on his team, I would say that the Suns record from the 2019-2020 season is worse than that team actually was. Injuries/suspensions to Ayton, Baynes, Oubre, Rubio, Booker and others forced Monty to play absolutely terrible bench lineups. I can still vividly remember the 3 pg lineups of: Elie Okobo, Ty Jerome, Jevon Carter, Oubre and Frank. This led to the Suns being worse than the actually were. You may wonder why the Suns played so well in the bubble, well besides major growth from M. Bridges and C. Johnson and the addition of Cam Payne, finally having a completely healthy roster (with the exception of Oubre) allowed this team to play up to its potential.   Also, James Jones had a great offseason - getting rid of Oubre, Okobo, Baynes, and Jerome while adding Crowder, Galloway, Moore, and Nader. Then he added Craig midseason this year and he's been great. The Suns still remain weak in their big man depth (an injury to Ayton or Saric is my number one fear as a Suns fan right now). But the improved depth of this team is tremendous. Everyone on the team belongs on an NBA roster (well, Jalen Smith is TBD there) which is something you couldn't say about most Suns players for the past 5 years.   Point being, while the Chris Paul addition has been big, I think that health and improved depth have been just as consequential, if not more so. In the case of the Suns, it is a massive over simplification to attribute all their improvement to CP3, and it takes away from the work our GM, coaching staff, trainers, and players have put in. I will grant the argument though that without the CP3 trade we don't get Nader, nor do we attract Crowder, Moore, or Galloway.  TLDR: due to multiple injuries at key positions the Suns record last season was worse than the team actually was; thus, using the change in the Suns record from last season to this season as a means for quantifying the impact of Chris Paul on the suns does not paint a completely accurate picture. Improved health and roster depth for the Suns have been just as consequential, if not more so, than the addition of CP3. Without CP3 there is no way this Suns team is a #2 seed in the west, but I believe they'd be sitting in the #5/#6 range if they still had Rubio instead of Paul.   Thank you for reading this rant."
"You should’ve seen it at the first quarter of the season. So many names were on pace: Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, KAT, Kyrie, Tobias, Jokic, Chris Paul"
When did Chris Paul get traded to the Hornets?
"Chris Paul was objectively worse and so was our team as a whole in 2019, as evident by us being 4th compared to 1st in 2018. Losing one close game to the warriors a year later doesn’t mean anything, in 2018 we were up 3-2 and Chris went down. We were well on the way to a championship."
Kind of pisses me off that Chris Paul had his worst season in 2019 then immediately changed his diet and workout routine after leaving lol
"That’s a bit true but Chris Paul was great for us. There’s a reason we went 50-5 with him, harden and clint"
"You think Chris Paul didn’t have great opportunities? Lob city clippers, rockets with Harden? The guy had amazing chances and failed to win. I love CP3, one of my favourite guards, but he didn’t lose because of any front office shortcomings. He lost because his teams choked."
Hello Police?! Chris Paul is trying to beat me up.
"I love Chris Paul but his win percentage here was because of Harden going fucking insane while everyone was hurt. He played 58 games each season here; the only season he played less was when he had surgery in like 2009.   He’s a top 5 PG of all time in my head , but stats like this is skewed and don’t show the whole picture. I’m sure you could do this with a ton of players who don’t affect winning."
HE CHANGED HIS NUMBER TO 4 TO SAY HES BETTER THAN CHRIS PAUL! 4&gt;3! I think.
Off topic but I feel like rondo is wearing number 4 to prove a point to Chris Paul because they always had beef. And yk 4&gt;3. Alternatively he wore that number in college but it’s my weird theory.
Chris Paul George Hill
On one hand this isn’t a basketball play at all. On the other hand it did happen to Chris Paul.
Think how bad all those numbers look without the Chris Paul years.
"Chris ""Give him respect for making Suns good"" Paul hit the side of the backboard yesterday."
"Chris Paul may be 36 years old but he's still really good and the orchestrator of that offense. Yeah, no fucks good defense will blitz good playmaking/scoring guards. Your statement was incorrect"
Every team in the nba blitzes Damian lillard lol there’s a big difference between blitzing Damian Lillard and constantly sending help at 36 year old Chris Paul
"He's done a disservice by people assuming he won that because of the triple doubles. He was truly impactful that year, and the definition of a winning player.  I would say the fact that the statistical totals have not dropped substantially in the time since, despite playing in just about every situation conceivable, is testament to how little those efforts have positively contributed to team success in subsequent seasons.   The stats are still there, the impact is not. Contrast that with someone like Chris Paul, for whom the stats have dropped, but the impact remains."
"Yeah, it’s not a “i’m going to behead this guy” sort of elbow, but it was still pushing Chris Paul while he was in the air, that’s really dangerous too"
"""Can we have George Paul tonight?""  ""We have George Paul at home.""  George Paul at home: Paul Chris."
Rajon Paul &gt; Chris Rondo
"my dude, maybe take a look at Patrick Beverley specifically and consider why people might say it about *him*.  If someone said it about any other NBA player I can think of, I'd be right on your side on this. Because the only reason to say it about most NBA players is pure racism.  However, Patrick Beverley, specifically, is a widely-hated individual who looks sketchy as fuck. People are gonna say this shit, because they hate him, and *he look sketchy as fuck*.  He's not hated because he's black, he's hated because he's *fucking dirty*. He has deliberately attempted to injure multiple other players. His actions in the clip under discussion here are, at *best*, extremely reckless, because what he does in this very clip risks significant injury to Chris Paul.  The combination of *is hated* and *looks sketchy as fuck* is gonna end here, and in this specific instance, it's not a race thing.  Personally, I'd have said *meth*head, because in my city people who look sketchy as fuck are usually on meth. They're also, usually, white. It's not a race thing.  It's a *fuck Patrick Beverley, who looks sketchy as a fuck* thing."
"And, you know, him putting up 17 and 4 on 40% TS while being payed $40 million dollars. But I should more so hate on whoever decided to get rid of Chris Paul and picks for his garbage ass"
They had Chris Paul
Good teams attract good players. Can't help it that Chris Paul wanted to join here while he still is an elite player.
Why do you think Chris Paul chose to get here? Because it was a middling team? Suns were an ascending team and would be around 6th seed if they didn't have Chris Paul but had Ricky of last year.

"Feels like you’ve really stripped any nuance out of the Westbrook discussion with this hyper iso ball stuff. The main criticisms of him as a player are about his efficiency and need to dominate the ball white not providing what top level guys need to provide in terms of efficiency. He’s polarizing as a high level passer who can also shoot his teams out of games and as a high energy player who will often not bring that energy to the defensive end. To just boil all that down to “hyper iso ball so who cares” I don’t even understand that. Certainly we have seen some teams rely heavily on isolation attacks like the Rockets or Cavs, but our most frequent champion has been the ball and player movement Warriors. Regardless, we aren’t in an era where every single isolation is praised.    If you are meaning that as one man creating the offense, I think he gets plenty of credit and criticism for that. But even then, we are not in an era which universally praises ball dominance and every ball dominant player isn’t equal. Chris Paul doing it is different from Westbrook. This isn’t to be overly critical of him, I’m just lost as far as how the era we are in makes it hard to understand familiar critiques."
"Needing Rondo in a Clips jersey to beat Chris Paul in a Suns jersey was not something I would’ve imagined just a year ago, but here we are"
"As a point guard? No you don't. Steve Nash never averaged over 20, even in his mvp seasons (15.5 &amp; 18.8) and didn't even average over 10 until his fifth season (3.3 pts per game his rookie year!!). Chris Paul has never averaged over 20. Lowry didn't average over 10 until his 7th season. Kidd basically never went over 15 ppg except for one time in 2003.  The PG stat is assists first and foremost. Defense stats (deflections, shots challenged, steals) are probably next. But there is variety amongst pgs - in the modern era a few high scoring PGs have come into the limelight (curry, lillard) alongside triple double guys (westbrook, doncic). But neither of those archetypes are necessary for greatness: Nash never averaged over 5 boards or even over 1 steal his whole career, all he stuffed the sheet with was assists. Killian Hayes isn't the next Nash but my point is being a good point guard has very little to do with PPG"
That’s his typical fuck Chris Paul stat line
Clippers put Dame and Chris Paul in jail in consecutive days
Live by the three live by the two       Die by Chris Paul
Chris Paul George
"You can say whatever about the ejection but that was a next-next-next level basketball play from Chris Paul.    In the slowmo you can actually see cp3 see the foul coming so he jumps to make whatever bev did more impactful.    99.99999% of players are going to see that coming foul, run into it, spin, dribble, fake shot whatever, and get the ball out of bounds but damn, that was unreal from cp"
He should be ejected. Just wrap chris paul up in a hug to stop the fast break. Goddamm
Isn’t he talking about Chris Paul
sitting Chris Paul for that long seemed like a big brain move but it became a wet fart.
its about to be CHRIS Paul vs Rondo rn!
You have to respect any team with Chris Paul and a real supporting cast
So does Chris Paul just not play anymore or what
Chris paul is picking the clips defense apart
"Chris Paul has been great but that's all the national media talks about and its been annoying. James Jones, Monty. and our player development coaches have been turning our young core into a cohesive unit before the man got here"
Chris Paul George Hill
"With the exception of LeBron, all the other stars who you say have had memorable performances have other great complementary players who make up for their deficiencies.  &gt; . Can’t say the same for Harden, the only post season where his numbers got better was the 2020 playoffs.   Just because you don't remember the games don't mean they didn't happen.   - 2015: 45 against the warriors in the wcf against four HOFers. All harden had was Dwight.  -2017: closes out MVP Russ in 5 games with Clint Capela as his second best player   -2018: dropped 44 against the wolves when Chris Paul shot 5-14   - 2019: 41 in an overtime win against KD, Steph, Klay, draymond, and iggy (literally 5 HOFers) with a clearly worse version of CP3 than in the 2017-2018 year.   I literally remember all of these. I honestly don't remember a ""memorable"" steph moment from the playoffs other than his turnover in 2016 in the finals. Kd had his first memorable playoff moment this year when he dropped 50 against the Bucks. Kawhi's buzzer beater obviously is his signature moment."
"As a Lakers fan since the early 80s, I can say that prior to Chris Paul, they weren't even given a passing thought other than ""those pathetic chumps"".  After acquiring CP3, dumb mf'ers had the nerve to act relevant.  Unbelievable.  Now it's just contempt."
Chris Paul was obviously an all star level player on that team as well. He just didn’t make the all star game due to missed games.
You should do one where you make Chris Paul Wiggins and make Silver Tony Snell and make the ref COVID lol.
"That is crazy. You're saying with a straight face Karl Malone and Chris Paul are not in the conversation of top 5 players when team success is removed? Luck is a component of success, bro.   And more so, you're saying ""careers don't matter"", yet, Karl Malone by popular wisdom may be the only player in the top 15 to 25 without a ring. lol."
1. Steve Nash 2. Chris Paul 3. Kevin Johnson / Jason Kidd
Chris Paul  Westbrook  Steve Francis/Cassell/Murphy
"• **Most of us were indifferent for years, but having a superstar denied to us in what was mostly a done deal and then given to the other team we share a building with pissed off a ton of fans.**  It’s all related to how deeply loyal the city is to Kobe Bryant. Knowing how humiliating that sweep in 2011 to Dallas was, we were sensing that perhaps, time was beginning to run out on his chances to ‘catch Michael’ and win titles while in the last bits of his prime.  And so, here came this trade the Lakers did with the New Orleans ~~Pelicans~~ Hornets and they were about to send Chris Paul in an attempt to help Kobe win another title. And also remember, the pure hate Laker fans had on the Heatles because of the emergence of LeBron as “Kobe’s replacement” in the NBA’s conscience.  Then, it got shot down to hell because of “basketball reasons.” All of a sudden, David Stern, Dan Gilbert and everyone else involved in killing this made trade was seen as an enemy among Kobe/Laker fans. And lull and behold, the one team CP3 does go to is the bastard redhead NBA team in SoCal who *all of a sudden* becomes a title contender through this unmitigated act the league does. And to many, the Clippers benefited from the NBA dismantling Kobe’s last legitimate chance at a title contender in his career.  Lob City to an extent was supposed to have been the last 3-4 years of Kobe’s career contending for titles. Instead to many, the Clippers **took** his chances away, and that’s why they’re detested."
Chris Paul and AI probably have him beat in the talent per inch scale
"Chris Paul, Isiah Thomas, Allen Iverson, Steph Curry"
Yeah. Seeing the Chris Paul trade to the Lakers get axed was bad enough. Then he got traded for a package that was viewed as inferior to the team down the hall and apathy turned to anger. Before that the Clippers were just that other LA team.
"Yeah, the Clippers pretty much have been instigating this since the Doc Rivers / Chris Paul days - like Lakers fans were pretty nonchalant and whatever about the Clippers for the past 30 years, in a way we often adopted them, but then the Clippers organization (or its players) started saying petty things, doing little disrespectful things like covering up our statues, our banners, etc., just because they didn't like playing around them.. they kicked the Lakers while they were down, going through a Jim Buss Jeannie Buss power struggle (with Jim running the team into the ground for 5 straight years).. all the while painting an easy target on themselves by blowing a 3-1 lead in 2015 and then recently in 2020.. Balmer comes in with the streetlights not spotlights campaign.. and as much as I'm aware the Lakers are always going to be an alluring destination (so really I'm not trying to play the victim or anything), the fact is that any player who has his sights set on LA can now choose the Clippers instead of the Lakers is a little grating, whereas before, the Lakers didn't have to worry about a neighboring team (we're seeing it both high profile and low profile these days).. Knicks fans kind of know what I'm talking about with the Nets these days."
Same with my friends that are clipper fans. We talk trash but it’s mainly on certain players on the team. I remember having talk with clipper fan about lakers making mistake picking up Trezz or how now they notice how much of a dick Chris Paul is.
Cupcake finals - come on put some respect on the Suns. They were 51-21 (.708) on the season. Chris Paul is probably a top 5 PG of all time. Booker dropped back to back 40pt games.  Yall need to quit acting like the Suns are a bunch of scrubs.
"Players are different on and off the floor.  Example look at Chris Paul and Malone  Malone was apparently an excellent teammate and stand up guy on the court even congratulating the bulls in their bus.  Off the court...  Chris Paul is a rat on the court but a great leader, family man, forgave the degenerates who killed his grandfather off the court."
Needs to see what they're teaching in the school of Chris Paul.
"&gt;going to the clips and making them better  He didn't make them better. He went there and they lost in the 2nd round, just like they had already done under Vinny Del Negro.  Del Negro went 40-26 and 56-26 after the Clippers got Chris Paul. Doc came in and went 57-25 and then 56-26. A 1-game improvement is basically margin of error, not a sign of significant improvement.  Not like Vinny was some great coach either, just ask Bulls fans. Basically any mediocre coach could've taken that Clippers roster to 55 wins and the 2nd round."
"Put Chris Paul beside him, see how he does."
The flopping and bitching was out of control. Fuck Chris Paul and fuck the Lakers too
"Chris Paul, Blake and Doc really made Lob City hateable across the whole league towards the end of that run. The entire league hated that team"
Yes. Chris Paul and Blake Griffin used to get booed when they went to Dodgers games.
"Yes, it all started with Chris Paul"
Imo he already should have made all defense this year and he averaged 14 ppg on 67% TS  All thats left is the scoring and seeing as how hes just 24 years old and with Chris Paul likely starting to decline I can see a jump in 4 ppg
Chris Paul would never
Is Chris Paul slightly skinnier Raymond Felton or is Raymond Felton slightly fatter Chris Paul?
"Locks since the last list, if over 25 you need to start cutting   Kobe, Lebron, Duncan, Iverson, Wade, Garnett, Dirk, Dwight, Nash, Durant, Russ, Curry, Kawhi, Harden, Pierce, Paul, Melo, Allen, Kidd, Giannis,   Others likely to make it   Pau, Tony Parker, Gary Payton, Reggie Miller, Mcgrady,   Others with a shot  Yao (you know why), Manu, Lowry, Ben Wallace, Vince Carter, Chris Bosh, Klay  That’s 32 people  20 locks, 5 other high likelihood, and 7 people to consider. So based on that  the max they need to cut from the old list is 7 people   I’m not a historian so I won’t judge who is better between the consideration people and the worst players in the old list"
"That 17-18 Rockets team was a stunningly built roster. Everyone talks about the Chris Paul injury, But LRMAM hurting his shoulder in the final regular season game was an absolute killer for them. No Ryan Anderson or Joe Johnson minutes in the conference finals if that doesn’t happen."
Chris Paul points more than any point guard.
- Lebron  - Kobe  - Duncan  - KG  - Dirk  - Nash  - Durant  - Steph  - Chris Paul  - Allen Iverson  - Paul Pierce  - James Harden  - Kawhi Leonard  - Giannis Antetkounmpo  - Dwyane Wade  - Jason Kidd
Good enough for the Hawks to pass on Chris Paul smfh
They took out chris paul who made it to the finals lmao
Chris Paul  Westbrook requested a trade to Rockets   Carmelo requested a trade here in 2016 and ended up signing in 2018.  Pippen  Drexler/Barkley requested trades here.  Chris Bosh gave us a commitment but Miami gave him the bag at the last minute.
"All that I’m arguing is that it was not a foregone conclusion that the Warriors lose the series with CP3 playing. Yes the odds were against them, but there are plenty of 3-1, much less 3-2 comeback stories in recent years in the playoffs. My argument is simply that the Warriors stars were playing better in that particular series than the Rockets stars.   In Game 5, Chris Paul shot 6/19 (31.6%) and had a plus/minus of -13. In Game 3, he shot 5/16 (31.8%) for a plus/minus of -18. He shot better in the other games (though still not great in game 2, 42.9%) but still had negative +/- in game 1. So in 4 out of the 5 games he played, he either shot middling to poor, had a negative plus/minus, or both. I don’t think it’s as obvious as you’re suggesting that him playing in games 6 and 7 would have absolutely made the difference. If he was playing well, maybe. But he had not been playing his best in that series.  I think what would’ve more likely made the difference is if Harden had shot better. In Game 7, he shot 2/13 from 3 for 15.4%."
"Ok, that’s a valid answer.  You said it could be argued that DWill can be argued as better than Chris Paul, and I disagree.  Chris Paul scored slightly better, was better at playmaking and way better at defense.  DWill being better in transition (which I’m not even sure I agree with) doesnt nearly close the gap enough.  I don’t see any argument for him over CP3.  The difference is pretty big imo.  There’s a reason CP3 is 2 on this list and Williams is 21, even if you think he should be higher.  Edit:  sorry, you’re not the guy who said that, that’s where the confusion came from"
"Being a better athlete in no way makes him better?  Is Russ the best player in the league? How about Grayson Allen or John wall?  Athleticism can be a tool that helps you actually produce, in the way that someone like giannis does, but it by itself is pretty meaningless.  There are plenty of insane athletes with no basketball skill, who couldn’t even make the league.  Giannis isn’t the best player because he’s the most athletic.  Giannis is the best player because he plays DPOY defense and scores at a crazy efficient rate.  DWill couldn’t even use his athleticism to be an average defender, while Chris Paul was elite on defense.  There is nothing that DWill was better at than Chris Paul."
"Chris Paul finally leads a team to the NBA Finals and gets dropped from the list, lol. Cold blooded."
So Tatum got much better and dropped 3 spots? I get Chris Paul raised the ceiling of the Suns drastically but he’s not a better individual player than Tatum
Chris Paul III
"Again, On paper that’s an amazing accomplishment, but when you’re playing a suns team that was way out of their depth and led by a 90 year old Chris Paul, it doesn’t mean as much. If he put up 50 against the clippers, lakers, nets, at full strength kind you, I’d be all on board for calling him the best player on the planet. Beating this years suns means nothing to me, it’s embarrassing they lost 2 games to that team."
"Well no, because Harden has never ever elevated his play in the post season. He's gotten worse, Luka's gotten better. Put Luka with Chris Paul or prime Westbrook and lets see what happens."
"Dwill is definitely a bit low, but he was never in the same ballpark as CP3.  Anyone saying he was better than CP3 should not be taken seriously.  Williams was less efficient, had less assists and more turnovers, and was much worse on defense.  He was probably the closest to Chris Paul in the league, but he wasn't all that close."
"I mean, they did. They won 2 home games and lost the third by 4 points. They had the skill to win the series. They didn't have the will, or more accurately they didn't have the will of Giannis which was a big ask for a young team against one very skilled man refusing to lose and your veteran is never won anything Chris Paul.  The sweep, however, was a bit hopeful lol"
"That was just the most used example, JJ Redick was not the first one to be promised to be traded somewhere (or not be traded) and get shafted  Promises in the NBA happen all the time, 2-3 years after people forget, the only reason this is a big deal is because JJ Redick became hella salty and has a large media presence   Morey promised CP3 he would not trade him, only to trade him right away  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/chris-paul-said-he-was-initially-shocked-by-trade-to-thunder-after-rockets-gm-told-him-he-wouldnt-be-moved/  Did anyone care? Nope, because CP3 did not talk much about it and had a career year in OKC and built up his reputation, value again and look at him now, and Morey got a big job right away so..  Like i said, Pelicans do things right, they are a contender in 2-3 years Zion will love it there, get the big bag and he won't complain, but if they fuck up like they did with AD then goodbye"
"Ya, they have him 17th also behind Devin Booker. Beal just had a better season points wise, Booker a better season results wise. They did put Trae ahead of Chris Paul and Irving, which I also agree with.      You can have you own take, but for trying to make a non-controversial list they got the ordering right."
"Tried to post this Just my two cents in the discussion...      Going through the initial list from NBA 50th anniversary and Simmon's Pantheon (given that he is/was the basketball savant)... seems that there are 27 players in the Pantheon (not on the 50) AND have ended their career later than 96:         Rank Player	               Rank Player	Rank	Player	Rank	Player   7	  Tim Duncan	39	 Dirk	69	Dennis Rodman	85	Arvydas Sabonis   8	  Kobe Bryant	41	 Gary Payton	72	Chris Webber	88	Shawn Kemp   20	  Lebron James	43	 Jason Kidd	74	Joe Dumars	89	Vince Carter   22	  Kevin Garnett	47	 Paul Pierce	77	Tracy McGrady	90	Chris Paul   28	  Dwyane Wade	55	 Dominique Wilkins	78	Dwight Howard	93	Kevin Johnson   36	  Steve Nash	62	Ray Allen	82	Chris Mullin	96	Tom Chambers   37	  Allen Iverson	63	Reggie Miller	84	Robert Horry		   IMO, all the names up to Rodman should be included in the 75, as well as Tracy, Dwight and Chris Paul - total 18 players      Of course the Pantheon doesn't include current household names as KD, Steph, Harden, Leonard or Giannis (could also add Westbrook in that list for MVP and number of All-NBA teams consideration). - other 6 players, bringing the total to 24.      That leaves one extra player to add in the top 75. Perhaps Jokic due to his late MVP, dunno.      The tough question to answer is whether we are keeping the initial NBA 50 list intact or can we remove a few names and create space for more current players?  |||| |:-|:-|:-| ||||"
I’d throw in Chris Paul there as well imo.
"I’m not blaming him for not getting over the hump in 2018, but we all saw how close he was that year even with a Chris Paul playing out of position. There’s no reason they should’ve split up after only like 2 years together, but harden didn’t like that cp3 took away from his style of play and that he was a guy willing to challenge harden. They were right there against the *warriors*."
"????????  You know that Harden averaged 29/6/6 on higher efficiency than Chris Paul right? And even in his horrendous shooting elimination game, he had 32/6/6…"
"Funny thing is Chris Paul told Clippers in 2017 too, but we had no cap space. He then opted in and the rest was history   We gave up way too much in that trade btw"
Lmao you’re calling Chris Paul the #1 option on the Suns??  Another great take. Keep em coming
"Another fun fact is at the same offseason this was happening, Chris Paul was telling the Clippers he was coming to Houston with Dwight Howard if they didn’t hire Doc Rivers."
Lol you mean DBook? The 8-0 Suns guy who needed Chris Paul to come in to even make the playoffs?  You’re gonna love it when KAT gets traded and is the 2nd option on a championship team then. Then you can be “right”.
"I mean if you have two All-NBA level players supported by a still very good Stephen Curry and high IQ Draymond, that team will still be elite. I mean look at the Suns, right? Chris Paul still playing at a high level and Booker/Ayton not even All-NBA players yet."
A) Chris Paul  B) Mike Conley  C) Kyle Lowry  D) Jrue Holiday
"Might get downvoted for this but harden gets no sympathy from me - he did carry the team yes. But he refused to make any of the adjustments or sacrifices a true #1 guy does. Front office bent over backwards for him, got him Dwight, didn’t work. Ok, got him Chris Paul, one of the top point guards of the generation. Harden, a natural 2 guard tells Chris Paul “nah you play off ball, I’m the PG”. Doesn’t work out. They go get him one of his close buddies, Russell Westbrook. You mentioned them trading capela - that was a move in part influenced by James harden. Because harden’s offense and game is spacing and kicking. Trading away that pretty good asset in capela was essentially the org saying “fuck it we’re all in on harden and Westbrook”. Of course that didn’t work either. Not to say that losing capela was all on him, but harden certainly influenced that move and didn’t mind it.    Over those 8 ish years harden never really sacrificed or stepped back. A player who’s growth I compare him to is Kobe in the mid 2000’s when the Lakers basically were stalled. Kobe, like harden was averaging stupid numbers and dragging his team. Like harden, Kobe dominated the ball and the offense, they basically were the offense. Except Kobe was willing to take a step back, let others play their game, and be a part of the offense, when they had a few more pieces because he recognized that forumula where it’s one guy is the offense and controls everything cannot win you a title. He stepped up his game as a leader and boom, 2 chips in 09/10. Harden has never taken that step back. Part of that is coaching, d’antoni built a system that’s basically harden or bust, but at the same time, harden, with all the tools FO gave him, never took a step back, try to develop as a leader, make necessary sacrifices or adjustments to his play or his he fits in the scheme of a team offense that might benefit the team in the long run. Mf had Chris Paul on his team and said no stand on the wing lemme be point"
"Chris Paul really rejuvenated his career by going vegan. I don’t think it had a big physical impact that you can view with your eyes, but it had a huge impact for his body and health. I doubt he’d get the extension he did if not for him going vegan after 2019."
"Prime Lowry averaged 22 and 7 on next level efficiency and the stats don’t even begin to tell the whole story. Best floor general not named Chris Paul. I’m not even responding to what you’re arguing, you’re just wrong on what he was."
"Let me guess:  &gt;!Player A: Chris Paul!&lt;  &gt;!Player B: Kyle Lowry or Mike Conley!&lt;  &gt;!Player C: (I had to google for this one so no submission, got it wrong.)!&lt;  &gt;!Player D: Jrue Holiday!&lt;  &amp;#x200B;  My ranking before knowing who it is:  A, B, D, C  My ranking after knowing who it is:  A, D, C, B"
"Take out Dame, Blake, Kyrie, Yao. Put Nique, Rodman, Pau, Gary Payton, Reggie Miller in as locks. Add Paul George and Chris Bosh as honorable mentions.   I don't get how AD is a lock and Pau is not. Pau was a second option on back-to-back championship runs, AD was on only one."
"all you have to do is pay attention to how things actually work instead of getting hung up on quotes from a dead man who even when he was alive directly fucked the lakers out of chris paul to try to benefit the small market new orleans hornets (failed if you look at the trade package but rewarded them with AD so ultimately succeeded), pump the value of the clippers (succeeded) and keep the lakers from dominating the league (succeeded).    no amount of out of context quotes from a notoriously shady and dishonest business man can change the reality of what plays out in front of us every season. you see it and i see it."
"&gt;Chris Paul (who chickened out in game 6 and didnt shoot it so idk if he could be on this list,  Did you even watch that game??"
Yeah and it isn't like this is new for Doc. After the Clippers lost Chris Paul he was asked in Blake and DeAndre could win a title and his answer was   “We think we can win a title building around him [Jordan] and Blake. You also need room in the budget for other people.”  And everyone knew after 2 first round losses in a row and Chris Paul leaving that the team was dead in the water as far as contending for a title.  When someone asks you if a guy you are paying a max salary on a long term contract is a championship player saying Yes should be a reflex.
Chris Paul would like a word w you.
"All those guys actually have varying levels of assholeness.  Like Duncan ""not talking to rookies who he thinks will eventually get cut"" (Tony Parker). Magic Johnson in practices to the team is what we think of Chris Paul now. And Russell as a coach, etc.  Abdul-Jabbar has a justified reason for his coldness to the media, but there are problems with family life.   And there are good stories about Jordan, Kobe and Bird being incredibly nice.  The way Kobe envisioned his mamba mentality and I will copy this excerpt from a google search. Is to ""Mamba Mentality is a mindset for constant self-improvement in the pursuit of your highest potential in life."""
"Statistically speaking, he’s a better/more efficient shooter. And he’s a significantly better post player than Dirk ever was.  I’m not really sure why saying Jokic is a better scorer than Dirk is so controversial other than maybe the nostalgia angle. I had this exact same conversation with a friend IRL who absolutely blew his gasket at the idea that Jokic might be a better shooter than Dirk and he just immediately yelled “do it for fucking longer then before you’re in the same sentence as Dirk!” He’s been doing it for about 4-5 years now, which is a pretty solid sample size IMO.  He’s basically the most efficient midrange shooter in the league and he’s also routinely up there with Chris Paul on any list that looks at shots in the clutch."
"None of those guys game depends on athleticism that much. Curry will still be draining threes in a few years time, Draymond's defence is built on intelligence, etc. Other than Klay's injuries, I see no reason why they can't be serious contenders in a few years time, kinda like Lebron or Chris Paul today"
"I know I’m not super old or anything but those Lob City Clippers were the most talented team I’ve seen not even make it to the Finals.   Prime Blake Griffin, Chris Paul, Deandre Jordan, JJ reddick? That team was stacked."
"Doc was GM for half the run and between his obsession with wasting first round picks to have constant roster turnover, never taking the Hack-a-DJ (amazing how the karma came back), and being obsessed with over the hill former Celtic players. Doc played a major part in the failures. One of the biggest faults of Doc is how emotional he gets when things are going poorly and how it can snowball into things like 2 different 3-1 collapses with two different rosters. Doc can work well as a underdog but when expectations are high and you are suspected to win something will happen and he will fail and Game 5 in vs OKC is on Chris Paul it’s been said by JJ and Blake that game 6 they were completely mentally unprepared to play."
"This subreddit would have collectively lost their shit if Simmons got traded for Paul. I know I would have thought that was a dumb trade for the sixers. But your absolutely right a big three of Chris Paul, butler, Embiid I mean forget the rest of the team. Them right there is a deadly combo."
"Over the past 10 playoffs, 10 guys have taken 200+ FGA in the 4th quarter or OT of games within single digits.

No he just realized the same thing Paul George and even Chris Paul thought playing under Doc is that he can be fake as hell. He spent all year telling Ben and media that nothing was wrong with his game and when it went wrong he didn’t want to back his guy
You mean the racist who fined mostly black people for wearing they own clothes and forced everybody to wear suits? You mean the man who made money off blocking Chris Paul from being traded to the lakers?
"Simmons has averaged 14.5 wins produced per season, but the last two seasons were abbreviated for Covid so an estimate of 16.5 wins per year is better.  Simmons has had a similar first four years to Chris Paul and John Stockton, but Magic was better.  Steph Curry, Jason Kidd and Lillard's first four years weren't even close to Simmons.  Nash had a bad first four:  [https://www.boxscoregeeks.com/players/3131-ben-simmons](https://www.boxscoregeeks.com/players/3131-ben-simmons)  https://www.boxscoregeeks.com/players/2136-magic-johnson  https://www.boxscoregeeks.com/players/211-chris-paul  [https://www.boxscoregeeks.com/players/1100-john-stockton](https://www.boxscoregeeks.com/players/1100-john-stockton)  [https://www.boxscoregeeks.com/players/92-stephen-curry](https://www.boxscoregeeks.com/players/92-stephen-curry)  [https://www.boxscoregeeks.com/players/1309-damian-lillard](https://www.boxscoregeeks.com/players/1309-damian-lillard)  https://www.boxscoregeeks.com/players/60-jason-kidd  [https://www.boxscoregeeks.com/players/269-steve-nash](https://www.boxscoregeeks.com/players/269-steve-nash)"
Do you think Chris Paul is the difference between legitimate championship contender and getting ass blasted in the first round by the Bucks?
"Correct, if there are no pathways to become a coach because you are black, then it is not a meritocracy and there's a racial bias. You're operating on the assumption that this is currently the case. This seems to be the area where we disagree.   For instance of all the players currently playing, who are considered to be legitimate coaching candidates? Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, Lebron James? If any of them wanted the opportunity, the pathway is there. If anything Udoka represents that pathway due to him being considered a no brainer future head coach since he first joined Pops coaching staff."
Can an older fan tell me if Chris Paul had similar levels of hate?
Clippers   PG: Chris Paul  SG: Paul George  SF: Kawhi Leonard  PF: Blake Griffin C: Bob McAdoo
It's L or K but after that C and G are pretty good  Chris Paul  Clyde Drexler  Carmelo Anthony  Charles Barkley  Chris Bosh   (Chris Webber's first name is not Chris)  lacks some interior defensive presence. Has some guys who can actually shoot a three.   G is also very nice  Gary Payton  George Gervin  Grant Hill  George McGinnis  Giannis   lacks anyone with a consistent 3 point shot though
"Chris Paul makes tons of risky plays, he’s not tj mcconel"
He did make all those shots when Chris Paul said all the kids would get shoes if he misses haha. Rather than like 3k in shoes he went ahead and hit the shots.
Man the NBPA is going to suffer a lot of setbacks because of Simmons. Chris Paul chose the best fucking time to dip and have CJ handle everything.
Why do people think circumstances don’t factor into results and if you replay the season 100 times you would get the same result 100 times. Did people really think jimmy butler was the difference between not even making the playoffs and coming within 2 games of being nba champions? Was Chris Paul the difference for the suns? These teams didn’t even make the playoffs. The heat got lambasted by covid last season and still managed to get the 6th seed with damn near no rest and had a terrible 4 games. I guess no improvement matters because they got swept in the previous season with different circumstances. Such a dumb way to look at things
"The entire Lob city era was filled with drama and issues and only way Doc managed through it was because he was there during the Sterling drama.  Clippers had the Chris Paul/Blake stuff,  Doc telling everyone DeAndre Jordan hacking wasn’t a issue when it was, the nepotism with bringing in Austin Rivers, Doc when he was the GM signing players to deals and giving them different roles as a coach, media telling him to play SGA when he was obsessed with playing Avery Bradley, and his track record handling young player in general"
"C'mon don't make Pistons fans look bad.   Chris Paul was integral and got hurt, and he continued to lose 2 games in a row to arguably the most talented roster ever assembled. They won more games than any other team did against GSW in a round until the Raptors did later with Durant and Klay getting hurt in the process."
"Probably Chris Paul. I’m not sure he would win but I think he is the best combination of defense, offense, and tenacity at guard.   Love to see what Jordan-Oscar Robinson would look like.  Would love to see what Jordan would do with Dame who shoots the most best deep balls, but lacking in D.   Also a full prime Klay Thompson would be interesting to see what the era differences are between the best two way 2 guards. Same with a prime Brandon Roy."
This man just commented that he’d put Jason Kid and Chris Paul over Curry. Definitely a troll post
"I would put guys like Chris paul, Magic, maybe even Jason Kidd over him. He's top 5 though."
"I don’t really think that Stephenson or Knight making one all-star team would’ve changed the way people view their careers if everything else had still gone the same way afterwards.  To be fair though, I’m having trouble coming up with a good example myself. Maybe if Chris Paul wins the 2008 MVP he has a legit argument as the GOAT Point Guard as opposed to just one of the greats? But that still doesn’t COMPLETELY change the way his career is viewed.   Perhaps in the negative reverse, if MCW doesn’t win RotY, he’s viewed as a huge bust?   People judge careers so strongly based on longevity as opposed to peaks, that it’s hard for me think of a good one to be honest."
Chris Paul/DWade
"You earned the ire, no hiding now. Ben Simmons doesn’t come, then Rich Paul will take it. Rich Paul doesn’t come, Chris Paul will take it. CP3 doesn’t come, Ben McLemore better be prepared. Even retired Paul Simon. We are the Sixers fans."
Chris Paul and Malcolm Brogdon.  Basically the same guy.
"there are a ton of suns fans who thought signing chris paul wasn't getting them to playoffs, bucks fans who thought jrue wasn't enough to put them over  pretty much any contender can win any given season, especially since a lot of contending teams are older and have injury issues  sixers fans who insist that they shouldn't take a flyer on a trade just to spite simmons are hilarious lol"
I think Chris Paul is up for debate and those that don't know his history will have his back.  Those that do know his history won't have his back.
Also talked a lot of shit to other players. One being Chris Paul who had beef(well CP3 at least) until they teamed up in LA.  First match up in the NBA CP3 was talking shit to redick while he was on the bench in a suit
"Hello police, Chris Paul is tryna to beat me up!"
"Look at all the players that have gone into the booth or become talking heads.  Do you think those players would make good coaches?  Barkley, Shaq, Kenny Smith, Chris Webber, Reggie Miller, Chauncey Billups, TMac, Paul Pierce, Stephen Jackson, Matt Barnes, Scottie Pippen, Richard Jefferson, Channing Frye, Jalen Rose.  Out of all those dudes the only people I would for sure want coaching a team would be Chauncey and Kenny, Chauncey is getting his chance and Kenny is currently looking iirc.  Others that I think could coach if they wanted would maybe be Jalen, Channing, and RJ mayyyybe TMac.  But there's also the question of are they even interested in coaching?  There's ~500 players in the League right now, I'd be willing to bet that a huge majority aren't even interested in coaching.   &gt;While the players who are black who remain involved in the sport are talking heads or in the booth almost exclusively.  Complete bullshit ""almost exclusively""  Out of all the big talking heads I named one is currently going to be a coach, and another has been interviewed.  Mark Jackson became a coach and sucked, Tyronn Lue and Doc Rivers have been out there for a good minute.  Jason Kidd is out running around even though he has a very questionable domestic + coaching past.  Nate McMillan, David Fizdale, Dwane Casey also.    If we look farther back we have Larry Drew, Lenny Wilkens, KC Jones, etc. etc. probably quite a few others I don't know"
I saw Chris paul his rookie year walking around OKC (hornets - when they relocated for Katrina) and talked to him for a little bit. Super nice guy. Also saw JR smith and he was ok but didn’t really wanna talk to people   Met willis reed and he was cool. I shook his hand and they were HUGE
"That's being intentionally dense. If they asked Monty Williams if Chris Paul could be still be the starting point guard on a championship team at his age, he would say yes, regardless of what he believed.   You think every coach is telling you the truth every time they get a question from a reporter?  That's what coaches do. They literally lie all the time. You always defend your guys, especially after a tough loss.   Doc made it clear that Ben was not his guy."
"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters:  |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/21/2021."
"Intellectually, I know that some people don't like Chris Paul.  But in my heart I'm like, how can you not love this man?"
Chris Paul is Kyrie Irving at 40 years old
Got to give it to Chris Paul. He's a fighter. Has gotten beat by the Dubs with 2 other strong teams in the playoffs and will more than likely meet them again this upcoming playoff. Would be a great story to see him finally beat them in a series for a return trip to the finals...
chris paul and monty williams have them so locked in and ALL the young guys have bought in.
"&gt; Team missing their 2nd best player has worse record than when they have their 2nd best player.  Lol uh yeah it's a little different when that second best player takes your team from a 62.5% win rate to an 86.2% win rate.   Again, nobody is saying Chris Paul was as good as a player as Harden was at the time. Just that he was the team leader, therefore he led the team. And also that without him the Rockets of those years would've never been in that position regardless.   Harden is awesome. An all time great. But he couldn't bring as much success to those teams alongside any other player in the NBA that he did with Chris Paul. Hell his team doesn't even look as good when he's next to Kevin Durant, and objectively better player than Chris Paul **ever** was. Chris Paul was the catalyst for that teams success, plain and simple."
"As point guard intangibles goes? Sure, CP is absolutely more talented than Curry on this regard. Curry also controls the tempo and playmaking in a elite way, but by performing drastically different plays than what a PG is supposed to do, which makes him unique and it's kinda laughable to see lesser talent like Lillard and Trae trying to mimic that. But the way CP plays is more traditional, that's a huge sample size of pure PGs before Curry arrived with his freakish shooting ability (he is more a combo guard, by far the best combo guard ever). And compared to all of these pure PGs, including Kidd, Nash, Stockton, Thomas, etc.. CP is the most talented between all of them. Magic got really close, but he had the luxury of playing in a super team his entire career (only LeBron had more help than him in NBA history), so I know people love to aggrandize Magic, but we can't never know if he would be the same high productive PG in a ""normal"" team, playing with DeAndre Jordan or Tyson Chandler instead of freaking KAJ, having role players cutting at the basket instead of James Worthy and so on. Chris Paul arrives in any roster, magically (no pun intended) he makes the team better, this is the definition of a elite PG"
"They improved by 10 wins, the narrative was that CP3 had missed a bunch of time, and Harden had been snubbed in year's past. He absolutely deserved it. Best record, best player, he was unbelievable.   But Houston doesn't make the improvement they did, or play at nearly the level they did without Chris Paul. Completely objectively. I mean we saw what that team looked like without him. When he missed time they struggled (and only got through it on the back of Harden dropping like 50 a night, which is a huge reason he won MVP). We see evidence of this not only in the regular season but both years in the playoffs, in a massive way.   Harden was the better player, but Paul was more *important*. He had more of a leadership role (which Harden has never been good at). He controlled the pace and tempo of the offense at a level that Harden could never.  Being the best player doesn't make you the most vital to your team's success. Now with that said, does any of this even work in the first place with Harden? No. Chris Paul needed him to play off of. They were the perfect compliment to each other in the back court. Their roles were just different. Most valuable player vs team leader. Chris Paul led those teams. Any time Harden has ever led a team he's lost the locker room, had major infighting, and a bunch of drama has ensued."
I thought Chris Paul usually ran the second unit on that team?
"It is ridiculous, and the Rocket stans on this thread getting their panties in a twist about the word ""led"" is pretty comical. Okay, so CP3 only led 2 teams to 17-game win streaks and played a critical role with a third team. There goes OP's entire argument, Chris Paul actually sucks."
"Smh, you average redditor. That's not nearly cherrypicked enough. Try this on for size:  There have been only been 17 streaks of 17 or more wins in NBA history since the NBA-ABA merger. Thats 17.6% by Chris Paul  Or if you don't want to cherry pick *that* much, there have only been 21 single-season streaks of 17 or more wins in NBA history. Honestly this one isn't even cherrypicked, because it doesn't make sense to include season-spanning streaks (like if a team won the last 11 games of one season, and the first 7 of the next season)"
And he showed that if you removed chris paul from that team they would also not be the same.  Whats your point?
Chris Paul and beating Golden State
"They're just so different. And yes while Curry is a PG, his off ball style breaks the mold so hard that he might as well be a SG. Curry's game was molded by the Warrior's motion offense scheme, and more importantly, having one of the most swiss army knife players of all time in Draymond Green, who is functionally the PG for much of the game. I kind of feel like Curry is a PG in the way LeBron is a PG. They're great playmakers, but truly they are another position. Chris Paul is a true, true PG, he controls the game."
"as a warriors fan, i gotta say the suns showed they're the better team and the top dog in the west right now with this win with booker not playing most of the game. Steph will shoot better on Friday though so it'll be interesting to see how the warriors defense reacts to Chris Paul and co and how/if Steph can get out of Mikal Jail."
"SO let's just clear this up real quick.   I understand Harden was the main guy on that team, but CP3 was very clearly their most important player. Even outside of the whole playoffs stuff, Chris Paul's impact on those Rocket teams is undeniable even in the regular season.   His first year there he got hurt on opening night. Missed 14 games. They went 10-4. Great start to the season, looking like the same Rockets team from the year before. Then Chris Paul came back. They won their next 14 games in a row. 11 of those by double figures, most by 20+. He gets hurt in the next game, they lose their next 5 in a row. They then go on to not only win these 17 in a row, but 28 out of 29 games.   He for sure led them there. Not because he was the best player, but because he was the heart and soul of that team. There is no denying that.  Edit: They were 50-8 with Chris Paul in 17-18. 15-9 without him."
Chris Paul at the right elbow moving to his right… automatic
Giannis wasn't going to lose + Chris Paul curse
"It’s vintage Chris Paul, bro. The last time he registered a double double like this was November 26!"
"They are a part of the post but they arent the main topic. If after that win streak i said, James Harden and Chris Paul led the Rockets to a 17 game win-streak would that be wrong? No. There is just no reason to include James Harden in a post about Chris Paul"
"You feel they aren’t under the rug based on what?Ayton doesn’t have the personality to sink the team because he’s upset. He loves Chris Paul and will always compete for him. And the team could care less about Sarver’s eventual ouster. I think they heard the news, talked about it as a team, and never thought about it again."
Chris Paul ain't no multi-classing bitch
"&gt; Obviously James Harden was an integral part of that team but this post is about Chris Paul not the 2017-2018 Rockets.  Bruh what? The 17-18 Houston Rockets are literally part of your post.  It's not my fault you said he ""led"" 3 different franchises when he pretty clearly wasn't leading that Rockets squad in the regular season"
Teams can be led by more than one player. Obviously James Harden was an integral part of that team but this post is about Chris Paul not the 2017-2018 Rockets.
Chris Paul did not lead the Rockets squad. He was very clearly the second option
Is the swipe up with the ball by Chris Paul on the last possession a foul or not? I thought they were changing that?
lol I get the Chris Paul hate I guess but why the Suns?
"The suns were a good team before the bubble, but Ayton was out for much of that year due to suspensions. Monty and James Jones had us on the right path, then you add Chris Paul and crowder"
I love when the drama on set leaks into their interviews. Chris Paul just standing there while Shaq disses Chuck for interrupting.
"Considering his size and what he accomplished with multiple teams getting better because of his presence (and mediocre centers owning their salaries to him), I think Chris Paul is the most talented point guard that ever played the game. Disregarding Magic and LeBron because they are freaks, giants playing the PG position... between all the other ""normal"" guards, I think CP is the most talented one, insane efficiency at barely 6 feet, mastered the midrange and tempo without a superstar at his side to improve his collective achievements... it's impressive, surreal talent"
I hate Chris Paul and the suns so I'm in a bad place rn
Chris Paul and Jae Crowder. Losing to these guys is the worst.
Chris Paul is the ultimate “better than his stats suggest” player. There are times when he just is completely controlling what’s happening on the floor.
You fucking bozo. 17 in a row. Don’t ever compare any of them to the point god. Just clamped up the Warriors and curry. Idk what else you want from Chris Paul
Why does Chris Paul always sound likes he’s gonna cry

"Funny enough, I was already doing an analysis on something related and I modeled some of the worst snubs of the last decade or so. Note, these are statistical snubs on fairly simple metrics (so no RAPTOR/EPM/DPM/LEBRON or older ones like PIPM/RAPM), so if a player missed a bunch of the early season, slumped early, or missed getting on because they just weren't recognized by either the fans or the coaches, that's not included.  * Jimmy Butler, 2021 (missed a chunk of games) * KAT, 2017 * Rudy Gobert, 2019 (mentioned by /u/NitroXYZ) * Bradley Beal, 2020 * Trae Young, 2021 (multiple mentions) * Damian Lillard, 2016 * Chris Paul, 2018 * Al Jefferson, 2014 (/u/jknuts1377) * Josh Smith, 2012 * Nikola Jokic, 2018 * Damian Lillard, 2017 (/u/AMos050) * DeAndre Jordan, 2015 * Clint Capela, 2019 * Blake Griffin, 2017 * Andre Drummond, 2019 * Stephen Curry, 2013 (/u/dmavs11 and /u/KareemWasTheGreatest)   Methodology is similar to dribbleanalytics' here https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bcdpls/oc_using_machine_learning_to_predict_the_2019_mvp/. One of the variables that isn't refined for this particular analysis is team winning percentage. End of season winning percentage was used (because it was already available for a different analysis) rather than record at the all-star break."

Chris Paul curry got an underrated rivalry through out the last decade
Chris Paul is Bald
Well because he ain’t… Chris Paul has been more consistent this season? Are we watching games or just reading reddit
Warriors need to invest in subliminal messaging to trigger Steph. Before games show him a video that subliminally reminds him of like when Chris Paul kicked him off the Rockets court or when Dame said Steph is seeing what it's like not playing with other all-stars
I'm giving it to the Warriors solely because Steph Curry always cooks Chris Paul
The knicks are lucky Chris Paul isn’t on the Nets. He would snitch on his untucked jersey lol
He's vaxxed so it shouldn't be that bad. Like Chris Paul right before the finals. You test positive and are infectious for a short period which is why they have the protocols. There are breakthrough infections even when vaxxed but those are very rare
"This clown said Harden has never been on a team he could play off ball with, somehow forgetting he’s been teammates with Chris Paul, Russ Westbrook, Kevin Durant, and Kyrie Irving all within the last 3 season 💀💀💀"
Yeah that’s pretty much what I would expect the 3 time scoring leader to do.  If only he would have dropped more than 12 points against Chris Paul a week ago
Rare Reddit Suns fan giving Chris Paul credit
Chris Paul
"I simply referred to him being guarded, not him being picked up at half court at the start of the action. When a player like chris paul gets picked up at half court and he has to give up the ball, later in the play they can pass it to him and he usually has enough space to operate, this just can't happen with steph, he gets swarmed the millisecond he gets the ball, every time."
Chris Paul for Westbrook
"Y’all think points is everything and that’s crazy. Trae young is arguably the worst defensive pg in the league sitting in the 10th seed but y’all wanna glamorize him cos his stats look good. Give me a break, Chris Paul could take the Suns to the finals again and I’m still gonna hear this shit there’s no winning wit some y’all. You stat nerds are different"
Chris and Paul
"&gt;  14 ppg for Chris Paul is literally close to his career average so that doesn’t really mean anything.  This is a bad argument. It may not mean much when we're comparing CP3 now to CP3 throughout his career, but we're comparing CP3 now to other players now. And the reality is that there are other PGs dropping 25/9."
Ummmm yes. 14 ppg for Chris Paul is literally close to his career average so that doesn’t really mean anything. Without him that team is already on vacation by April like they were every year before he arrived. He literally carries everywhere he goes. Remember when OKC made the playoffs after having a 2% chance of making it. Remember when he took the Suns to the finals after they missed the playoffs 10 years consecutively. You’re sadly mistaken on who Chris Paul is
Is Chris Paul even the best guard on his team?
Two words: Chris and Paul must see television
Not again......  But I'll say it again. Chris Paul is the second best point guard currently.
A bigger Chris Paul as far as play goes
Because harden got Chris Paul at age 33. Give him a 20 year old Paul and they win multiple chips
"The ""real"" point guard is basically dead. Everyone is expected to be able to create for themselves and others now. The only true point guards who are succeeding at all right now are Chris Paul, Lonzo, and Rubio"
I mean Harden shot 5/20 in game 5 and in general was pretty bad in that series. The Warriors got trapped by the Rockets switching scheme and KD’s tendency to stall the ball movement with his isolation plays. And obviously Chris Paul got injured   If we play that series 100 times how many times does 0-27 happen as well?
It’s hard to not take Chris Paul here. Every team this guy has got traded to has improved or taken to the playoffs.   His latest team (Phoenix) are on the line for 17 straight wins tonight.
"&gt; Considerations from Celtics? Okay.   The owners are all friends and colleagues. They're not going to screw each other over something as minor as a draft pick or a trade. They have more important things that they need to be unified on, like CBA negotiations.   Even on stuff like the Lakers-CP3 trade getting vetoed, you didn't see any outrage from Lakers ownership. Lakers ownership knew there were more important things than whether his team got 1 PG or another.   [Here's Jeanie Buss, who was proxy owner for Dr Buss at the time due to his health conditions, **defending Stern's decision.**](https://www.sportscasting.com/lakers-owner-jeanie-buss-nba-chris-paul-kobe-bryant-lakers/) Why? Because allowing the trade would've upset the other owners. And the Busses knew that maintaining relationships with their fellow owners was more important than getting Chris Paul or not."
"It’s true, but it’s also possible that it’s only true because those guys aren’t the enablers that Westbrook is. D-Lo has played with KAT and still plays with Malik Beasley who is an insanely explosive scorer. Fox plays with Buddy Heild, who was picked before Jamal.  I’m not saying the dude is Chris Paul. All I’m saying is that he can still play and he definitely knows how to play. I don’t buy that Russ has a low basketball IQ because players like that can’t lead successful teams and usually aren’t leaders in general, which he is."
"I get that, but last year he averaged the same number of rebounds per 36 as Chris Paul. He still should be getting way more than a 6’ pg."
"If you think Trae is gonna be better than Stockton, Big O  or Chris Paul. Then you just don't know very much about those guys."
"I would think he’s in the mix with Snyder, Doc, and maybe Monty? There’s still a lot of basketball to be played so anything can happen but I think could be third. Monty is having an incredible season but he *did* add Chris Paul. Snyder is obviously the favorite rn."
He is already better than both of them.  Instead of Chris Paul and Mikal Bridges he plays with a bunch of bums.
"CP3 and LeBron were my first thoughts but you already mentioned them.  honestly i feel like chris paul is that dude, he massively elevates everyone's game around him, he's just too savvy"
"Calling anyone who has a first name as their last name by their last name sounds really weird      Ex. Chris Paul, Lebron james, kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Anthony Davis, Tim Duncan, Kobe Bryant, Dwight Howard. The only exeptions to this are d’angelo Russell and Michael Jordan"
LaVine has been better than both this season individually speaking. Booker is a better playmaker but with Chris Paul his assists have gone down
"To be fair, this is manslaughter.   First must show intent to kill. DJ committed no crime against Mr. Knight-  who was a merely casualty of nasty pass from Chris Paul and DJ's athletic monstrosity. The real crime was the PTSD committed. PTSD...it ends careers.  Ahh...**there's the door**"
"Steph and James Harden are a better shooters, and Chris Paul has an argument for being able to elevate a team beyond its potential on the floor. But with Dame's ruggedness, willingness to carry a team in the final moments, and loyalty, I think he has a good case for being the first pick for any franchise. Plus, he tends to add new wrinkles to his game every year, working on any barriers to team success."
He never mentiomed chris paul. He mentioned booker. Cp3 is phx best player while booker is the teams best iso scorer. Cp3 deserves it over booker
"Chris Paul is amazing and very important to the team just by virtue of being really fucking good, but the Suns are *not* being carried by him. We're good because we have 2 elite offensive creators and 12 other guys who can play team defense and shoot. Also Deandre Ayton for whatever that's worth."
"Harden does not lead a team better than Curry, Hardens teams only became contenders after Chris Paul arrived. Took the Warriors to 7 games and Chris Paul being out game 7 resulted in the worst shooting performance we’ve ever seen out of any team in the playoff. Is that leading?"
Remember when Chris Paul dapped up a fan in the front row while dribbling out the clock and it was a turnover? I think there’s untapped tactics here
"I mean that's kind of the point though right? It's not a team full of polished ready to roll talen it's not a team that's got a Chris Paul or a Rudy gobert or a kawhi Leonard or an Anthony Davis sitting in the wings. It's not a team that can afford for him to have an off week or so because as you stated they don't currently have the firepower to blow guys out. It's a team that lives and dies by demar right now. I don't know if you've had a chance to watch them much this year. They're full of young up and coming players but The difference in offensive cohesion when he's on versus off is absolutely dramatic. He has become one of the most measured floor generals in the entire NBA. off the top of my head I can think of at least six of those 18 wins that demar single-handedly 100%, won for them. So just saying that those players are better than him I think is to do a disservice to how radically he has morphed his game the last couple of years. And again this is coming from someone that was one of his most vocal critics during those raptor runs. I used to throw a huge huge fit every time he would be named an All Star. The guy is damn good right now."
"People are going to freak on me for saying this but Chris Paul or Zion. Look the West is incredibly deep. I actually have Phoenix as one of my dark horses come out of the West I think they've really put it together. And Zion doing what he is doing at the age of when she's doing it is incredible. But call me old school, I think and always have thought that an all-star was supposed to be a 50/50 combination of skill and stat recognition and team performance. The pelicans have just not been great this year. And by pretty much all metrics have underperformed season predictions. I wouldn't say that Zions fault but it's the reality. And the suns are great but again I take issue with a lot of the teams in the West having two All-Stars to the Spurs zero when taking into consideration performance, performance in relation to expectations, and roster construction. Demar is by far the best player on the Spurs and has been one of the most efficient offensive players in the league. Among the teams that had two All-Stars in the West Chris Paul is the one I would be most inclined to replace with demar. I don't feel great about it. I think he's been transformative for that sun's team. Once again I don't see how anyone can justify watching this year's Spurs team and seeing how huge of a role DeMar plays for them and be okay with his Spurs being the only team above 500 without an all-star this year."
He does. He also plays with Chris Paul. The Spurs second best player is dejounte Murray... This isn't to take any shots at DJ. He's an up-and-coming point guard for sure. The whole point he's making is DeMar DeRozan is by far the best player on the team with the ninth best record in the NBA and in some cases he's not even showing up on snublists let alone getting the All-Star recognition he rightfully deserved this year. I personally think Booker deserves it You guys have been great this year. I just don't personally think you guys should get two all-stars while the Spurs get zero based off expectations performance and roster construction.
Little darling   Chris Paul Jinx in effect
"Paul George 2019, Chris Paul 2008, Peja Stojakovic 2004, Kawhi Leonard 2016"
"Assuming 2010 was his peak, we have; Lebron, Carmelo, Chris Paul, Dwyane Wade, Kobe, Garnett, Dwight, Durant, Deron Williams, Nash, were all better.  Rondo, Roy, and Joe Johnson also were arguably better that him"
"Or you know, those teams got conley and chris paul as replacements while the wolves got teague. Rubio was playing great for the jazz and suns, just cause he's playing bad for this sorry ass franchise doesn't mean he's terrible"
"The last 3 seasons he’s had either Chris Paul or Russel Westbrook as a go-to guy so it kind of helped and the last time Harden actually was a good teammate wasn’t since 2016. Notice how he had a full roster that season to blend everything together. In LaVine’s case, he’s got young, inexperienced teammates with not even a year under good coaching. So please stop saying that LaVine doesn’t make his teammates better when they are all having career seasons…"
"i mean that’s what taking a charge is? and they’re not gonna give it to you unless you fall down. not everyone is an athletic freak that can meet people at the summit. the charge is a tool that makes smaller guys like kyle lowry and chris paul able to be savvy, full court defenders.   you can argue whether dame was sliding but writing off the whole concept of a charge is wild."
"The same argument was made about Steven Nash.   At the time, many people argued that he wasn't the best player on the Suns.   And that was likely true.    He was 5th on the team in minutes, his +/- was behind Marion and Amare. They both scored more than Nash (Amare scored more than 10 points more per game) and both got nearly as many rebounds as Nash did assists.  And though Marion didn't score much more than Nash, he did play far superior defense.   There is even a case to be made that JJ was better than Nash.   And yet, Nash managed to bring out the best in all of them. He was the glue guy and the play maker, and the temp setter, and the leader.   He might not have been their best player, but Nash was certainly their most valuable.   And a similar case could be made for Chris Paul as well.   I mean, Booker's been scoring a lot for several years, one season they got 19 wins; another they got 21.  They are playing at an entirely different level now."
Chris Paul isnt the MVP of the Suns so how could he be in the convo for league MVP
Don’t forget Chris Paul too
*in two years chris paul/james jones/monty williams... etc. ftfy
I'll never forgive him for crying to the ref's about another player's jersey being untucked.   Fuck. Chris. Paul.
Chris Paul made you relevant.
"I played a game of 2k some years ago where CP3 got 9 steals in the first half, I was fucking livid because there was no way that was possible. I'm sorry 2k Chris Paul, but you're no TJ McConnell"
Here's the top 25 from BR/Stathead if you're curious. https://i.imgur.com/4qmutMk.png  The one shocking outlier is Chris Paul with a staggeringly low .078 of assisted shots %. The man just makes his own buckets.
"it's literally one move, getting chris paul.  CP3 just belongs in that category of making everyone better, it's real hard to find such players in the league"
Aren’t the Suns number 2?  Why the disrespect to what Chris Paul has built
That Houston team did have a top-3 player. They'd have won the title if they had him AND Chris Paul together all through the postseason.
I'm just gonna say Daryl Morey has changed a team that was swept in the 1st round into the number 1 seed in the east without even acquiring any superstar but by getting guys that actually complement the stars like Curry Green and Dwight  Getting better is easy when you get Chris Paul or Harden
"Lost lots of games?   That team saw steady improvement in each of his final three seasons.   He performed well each year. He got 45 wins his first year, then then the team was torn apart after the Chris Paul trade, and they went into rebuild, during which the team improve each year.   Then, the year they fired him, they fell from 48 wins to 33 wins.  So, I guess ""lost a lot of games"" doesn't really seem like a reason from where I'm standing.  He was fired because the front office failed to put quality players around AD.  Monty did the best he could do with what he had.  He's never underperformed as a coach yet.   Pretty much every roster he's had as performed at or above expectations.   You can't blame a guy for not winning 60 games when you don't give him the personal to do that."
James Jones making great moves like having Chris Paul say he's OK with being traded to your team. And Monty making great coaching adjustments like having Chris Paul on your roster.
The thing is they deserved to lose that series. They were down 3-2 and Chris Paul got hurt and they won the next 2
"Players that are no longer on the team from 2 years ago (not gonna name EVERYONE, just the notables):  Qunicy Acy, Ryan Anderson, Trevor Ariza, Dragen Bender, Isiah Canaan. Tyson Chandler. Jamal Crawford. Troy Daniels, Jimmer Freddette, Richaun Holmes, Josh Jackson, Tyler Johnson, TJ Warren  Players that remained on the team:  Deandre Ayton, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges  Players they have acquired since then that are on the team this year:  Cameron Johnson, Chris Paul, Jaw Crowder, Jalen Smith, Dario Saric, Frank Kaminsky, Cameron Payne, E'Twuan Moore  I dont know about Monty but James Jones deserves a ton of credit."
"Chris Finch; Chris Paul; Christ, Jesus.  Don't matter, they can't be saved"
"I'm not sure what you mean about flailing arms, but I think you might have misspelled Karl Malone. KD and Chris Paul got a lot of attention for the rip, but that's classic Mailman. Tim Duncan used to do it too. You kids need a sense of history and perspective!"
"the year before the Rookies sported a 30 years young rookie Jorge Garborosa along with 22 year olds Paul Mislap and Andrea ""Primo Pasta"" Bargnani; 23 year olds Adam ""Mustache Morrison and Brandon Roy; and babies (21) Jordon Farmar and Rudy Gay.  Jorge was a year younger than KG, who would appear in his 10th allstar game the next night. And he was older than many of the other allstars, including Gilbert Arenas, Dwyane Wade, Lebron James, Chris Bosh, Dwight Howard..."
It's the Chris Paul factor.
"Gotta say, I'm enjoying this season of The New Adventures of Old Chris Paul."
"I'm sorry but this is the hard truth. Hes not the reason they lost, but he just isn't one of the top 3 players in the nba and he never was. You need an mvp level player to win a championship,  only 3 teams have ever won a championship without a mvp on their team: Pistons 1989, Pistons 1990, Pistons 2004. Thats it. There was no way Chris Paul could ever be the best player on a championship team, and thats not a knock on him, he's still HOF level."
G Chris Paul 6'  G Steph Curry 6'3  F Michael Jordan 6'6  F Charles Barkley 6'5  C Anthony Davis 6'10
"U can’t say 100% they would make it, but I wouldve for sure expected them to. I think people underestimate the suns roster which is one of the deepest teams in the league. Chris Paul is a great leader for that team, and sets up other guys for success but he’s not doing it singlehandedly. He didn’t even score his first bucket till the middle of the 3rd yesterday."
People forget the Suns we’re doing well to start the season last year then ayton got suspended. Took all the wind out from under their sail. I think without the suspension they could have been a playoff team which is a huge improvement from what they were before. Chris Paul took them from a playoff team to first in the conference. Both coaching/gm should be praised as well as Chris Paul. Monty and Jones improved the team on their own and Chris Paul took them to an even higher level
Chris Paul.
"And the best version of your Rockets, the Rockets that came within one game of the Finals? Had Chris Paul taking 20% of his shots 10-16 feet from the basket, and another 11% from further out. Chris Paul who by the way is hardly a ""dominant scorer""--it's certainly part of his skillset, but his 18pts/game is not what's making him 41M this year.  No one except you is saying ""heavily challenge"" in this instance, no one is closing out hard on a short jumper because like I said that's the shot they want. Even then you still have a body in there to contest even a little bit...even if you buy the statistical argument against 2s you also should at least buy the general defensive philosophy to not let shooters be comfortable and gain rhythm.   On that subject though, it's amusing to me that you talk as if a 10ft shot, which is well inside free throw distance, and a 23ft shot, which is pretty much shooting with your foot on the line, as if teams defend those exactly the same and they're the same types of shot. The further end of that range is where almost nobody averages a double-digit percentages of their shots for good reason, and is absolutely not what I'm arguing is beneficial.  I'm also not saying everyone on the team needs to be taking midrange shots, nor am I saying spot-up 2s need to come back from whatever era, or whatever other goofy shit. I'm saying if you're capable of creating for yourself (1 or 2 of whom ideally should ideally exist on every team, even if they're not a Durant or Kawhi) it can very potentially help open things up with the occasional midranger. Like if you're averaging 18 shots a game I'm talking literally like 2-3 shots. Nobody's losing a ton of games cause your 1st or 2nd option took 3 sub-optimal shots"
"I know you’re not attributing the success of a team the moment Chris Paul gets there to coincidental improvements of the players who were already there, while simultaneously failing to attribute those players improvement TO THE ARRIVAL of CP3"
*Chris Paul takes the suns from...
Chris Paul effect.  GOAT PG
"Because you are saying something that isnt factual. Lebron does not get more hate than other superstars in this sub. Rondo SPAT on Chris Paul and people up voted it. That is one example among many, stop this nonsense.  I dont dick ride anyone, I like James Harden because he's the second best Rocket of all time and I want to see him win a ring. I would never tell you anything delusional like he's better than Lebron or he's been MVP over  Embid this season or that he's most liked superstar when he istn. What you are saying about Lebron is you stanning him and wanting him to be number 1 in hatred for some weird ass reason."
Chris Paul.....
"LeBron wouldn't sign with Dolan in a salary cap because he needs a good team surrounded around him. With a $40 million LeBron contract, it takes managerial skills to build a team around him with a limited cap. But if Dolan can spend $400 million, he can put whoever he wants around LeBron by throwing money at other all-stars. Why would Anthony Davis, Chris Paul, and a great 3 point shooter like Joe Harris say, ""We'd rather not double our salaries and go play with LeBron. I'll take $30 million instead of $60 million and go to San Antonio."""
Love that Chris Paul is getting this recognition. The Point God is my pick for GOAT PG for on-court production only.
Chris Paul always performs better in the playoffs then in the regular season too which is just an incredible tidbit
"I say this as someone who thinks Chris Paul is better: it is close and the only wrong opinion in the matter is saying ""it's not close"" in either direction for either guy."
"The Clips definitely should have beat us, but at the same time, Chris Paul missed the first two games of that series (they lost game 2 by 6 points). If Chris Paul plays in game 2, we probably get swept and the 3-1 lead is never blown."
"It’s probably because many never got to watch Stockton play. I was 2 when he retired, so I never got to see his influence in the same way I have with Chris Paul."
"I don't want Chris Paul to leave. Dude just shows up, hits literally 1 shot in the entire game, and magically the suns now beat the Lakers. It's crazy the impact he has. He is LeBron in a smaller package"
...and then playoff times come and Chris Paul is hurt. Until this is proven otherwise I can't just start trusting them. Although I love watching CP3 at the moment as he is clearly the best player evertime he steps on the court orchestrating like a puppetmaster.
Chris Paul throughout his career has been able to push his teams into success. If he’s healthy and playing you have a guaranteed top offense and defense. He’s a first ballot and all time great
Chris Paul led teams that were contenders before and he's on a contender again. I'm not telling you they're favorites.
"But also the Suns weren't the same team. Ayton needed to be the second best player on that team. Now, CP3 and some of the bench guys like Saric and Crowder have taken some of that scoring burden off Ayton, letting him grab rebounds, get fed down low, and anchor the defense. When Chris Paul retires/leaves Ayton will have a bigger role"
Chris Paul choked in the playoffs in his prime- now that he’s on his 9th team leading a franchise that’s done nothing but lose since Nash was there is suddenly going to beat Utah/lakers/clips? I think not
"yeah, well if you're looking at a top 30 player ever, he's probably not gonna be representative of the whole. same shit for Steph, KD, and Chris Paul. yeah they can score where they want but they are or were superstars."
What is the Chris Paul response I’m supposed to be seeing?
"Sure, it’s just incredibly arbitrary. Chris Paul wasn’t even on the team for those 8 wins so i don’t see how they factor into this years contention"
I won't really ever understand how this subreddit can be so high on Chris Paul and appreciate his ability to influence a game without scoring and then at the same time overlook Stockton.      I'd personally argue Stockton was a better player but if you think they're neck and neck surely the tiebreaker deserves to go in Stockton's favour for his longevity and endurance. He played every game in 17 different seasons!
"A question with no answer, the price for Chris Paul is obviously going to be different than Luka Doncic."
Better rebounder is because of Magic' size which doesn't matter as much. Better passer well Chris Paul is also one of the greatest passers of all time with great assist to turnover ratio and Paul is a way better defender than Magic. I just think as far as player ability they're pretty similar
You know those Peyton Manning breakdown videos where he highlights a player or a team and just dissects their plays?  I'd love to see an NBA version of that with Chris Paul doing it
"The best ones have a great grasp on x and os in both leagues.  LeBron James and Chris Paul know the game inside and out too.  When you see a next level player, they are almost always smarter than their opponent along with athletically gifted.  Yes, there are exceptions, but guys like Harden and Curry break the game because they know how to.  Put chris Paul's brain in kyrie and you have the greatest pg of all time."
PG - Chris Paul 6’0  SG- James Harden 6’5  SF - Jordan 6’6  PF - Barkley 6’6  C - Wes Unseld 6’7
"Last night's game demonstrated two things.  First: Chris Paul deserves to be in the MPV conversation. I'm not saying he should win, but this guy has had such an impressive influence on this team, as he has with EVERY team he joins.  People look a per game averages and weight MVP on that, but there is so much more than that. It's why Beal had such an amazing personal season despite his team sucking. Those sexy per game averages don't tell you everything about the importance a guy has on the floor.     Second: AD is the Lakers MVP this season. We saw the Lakers before AD (a lottery team), and we see them now (3-6 over the last 9 games), and it is clear: LBJ is the maestro, but AD is the engine."
Kid better hope he doesn't see LeBron in the playoffs. Petty shit like that on the pettiest active non-Chris Paul player?
Chris Paul makes teams better.
"I feel if Chris Paul didn't get hurt we would have won that series, but such a fickle woman, lady luck is. Y'all were def the better team in the championship though..."

"If size and strength are prerequisite to make it in the NBA, how do you explain guys like Chris Paul?:0 he doesn't have the size or strength?"
"Harden seems to kinda do the bare minimum in crunch time. Like in both 2018 and 2019 he'd have multiple 4th quarters with just 3 or 4 FGA, maybe less. Seemed like he deferred to Chris paul a lot in 2018. And game 6 in 2019 with no kd and steph playing like crap he didnt take over the 4th or the game like he should've. Only shot it like 3 or 4 times again. If he went out like westbrook and just shot it like 15-20 times in the 4th that would've been more exciting but seemed like he was more concerned with keeping his efficiency numbers up than winning"
"The Cavs might have drafted Klay instead of Kyrie if they had someone like Chris Paul already running the point and coming off of a championship season, then where would the warriors be?"
"The worst thing LeBron ever did was not commit to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Had he done so instead of sign one or two year contracts, we would have had the promise of some stability when recruiting free agents and coaches. Instead, the best we could ever do before 2015 was sign guys like Larry Hughes and Mo Williams. Had he stuck to his guns and said we’re playing for MY team, Dwyane Wade and either Bosh or Chris Paul would have joined instead of them going to miami and we sleepwalk the East for the next 15 years. The biggest question mark is whether we draft Kyrie Irving with the Clippers’ number one overall in 2011 and with Chris Paul and D Wade I don’t know that we do. At that point was the fo smart enough to avoid the mine field that separated 2 and 9? Best case scenario we draft Valanciunas as the heir apparent to Z but could have very well ended up with Derrick Williams, Enes Kanter, Jan Vesely, or Brandon Knight. On the other hand, maybe we look to add a sharp-shooting backup 2 guard with great defense and championship pedigree in Klay Thompson. Another question is whether David Griffen takes over the GM role? He made some brilliant moves that played a big part in our championship but would we have had a player like Kevin Love in 2015? Would his partnership with AD have started years earlier? Would peak Boogie Cousins or Lamarcus Aldridge have joined up? Would a real coach have come to Cleveland instead of the clown car of HCs we have had?  Safe to say he would have rings. Possible he would enjoy two long spells of consecutive championships broken up by a bad matchup here or there or its not outside the realm of possibility he wins a dozen or more rings"
"Huh? Gobert is decidedly better than either Chris Paul or Booker, and Mitchell is at least as good as Booker, probably better. The coaches in the league seem to think Mitchell is better."
Chris Paul making a huge difference everywhere he goes..
Chris Paul really that dude huh.
"Hard disagree on the first part. Absolutely can get annoying watching players mouthing off after every play, especially when they're choosing to do so over getting back on the other end of the floor.   Not only does it get annoying to watch, but it's ridiculous to say that shit has no direct effect on a game. Veterans like Lebron James, Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, etc don't do it every single game for fun. They do it because they know the more they do the more they can influence the whistle to go their way."
"Given what we're seeing with Old Chris Paul and Booker, Young Chris Paul and Kobe would have been like the KD Warriors."
For the Lakers it was anytime Jared Dudley tried to do anything basketball related.   For the Suns it was Chris Paul forcing all of the offense to run through Dario Saric for the final 15 minutes of the game.
Chris Paul might be the best player to never win a ring (yet).
"&gt;What are you talking about? Take a look at this thread? There is no one clowning him and anyone who is getting downvoted to hell. Embid gets clowned on a ton.  Embiid is consensus MVP on this sub  &gt;Have you ever been to a Harden, Westbrook or even CURRY thread after they are ass???   Harden literally got praised for not only being the MVP and best player in the league yesterday, but some tried to argue he's better than Michael Jordan. He's not hated in this sub anymore  Agreed about Westbrook, he gets waaaaay too much hate, but tbf I was talking about superstar caliber players, and Russ isn't anymore, so it's hard to compare his hate to everyone else's  Curry is the most loved player on this sub by far, now I know you're just makin shit up. Some dude even did a study and found that, as every top highlight post was from Curry. Curry has plays made outside of the actual game reach 20k upvotes  &gt;Do you get that there were people on here that literally cheered that Chris Paul hot spit on? Or that PG was dealing with mental health issues so much because of how much he was clowned???  The top post of this sub for a long time was that LeBron gave Kevin Love crippling depression.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8yyx4f/not\_enough\_is\_made\_of\_the\_fact\_that\_lebron\_got/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8yyx4f/not_enough_is_made_of_the_fact_that_lebron_got/)  I can do the same thing you're doing; A lotta posts shit on stars like that, and they all come at times when it's easiest to hate on them. At times when Bron's team is struggling even just a bit, no matter the reason (like health), he gets the most hate by far, and this is just one example.   After we lost games without AD or Schroder there were 100 posts about how we were frauds and that LeBron 'can't win regular season games without superstars'. I'm not takin it to heart, just explainin why you're off there  &gt;Bro this last paragraph is so out of touch with what’s actually happening, stop it. No one is flipping anything.  Difference is I've provided examples and agree that a lotta other players get shit on too, but of the top players in the past few months, Bron has more than all of them"
"Chris Paul is a great freaking leader man. He might not score or be as active as he once was, but him just being on the court commands effort from those around. Literally changed the culture of this franchise, shame he couldn’t win a ring during his prime."
"What are you talking about? Take a look at this thread? There is no one clowning him and anyone who is getting downvoted to hell. Embid gets clowned on a ton. Have you ever been to a Harden, Westbrook or even CURRY thread after they are ass??? Do you get that there were people on here that literally cheered that Chris Paul hot spit on? Or that PG was dealing with mental health issues so much because of how much he was clowned???   Bro this last paragraph is so out of touch with what’s actually happening, stop it. No one is flipping anything."
Chris Paul can definitely make the same pass hundreds of times in a row if he’s like 7 feet away from the shooter
"Ah yes, famed white hoopers Chris Paul and Julius Randle"
I mean.. who is better between Chris Paul and Rudy Gobert? How do you compare the two?
"&gt;My basketball ops [operations] got maybe a little weak at the end, and I just said, ‘We’re doing this. We are going to make the change. We’re going to go after it and roll the dice. We’re going to find that 5 percent.’  This is a Tilman quote after the deal was made. There were rumors about a Chris Paul trade and Morey assured him he wasn't getting traded. Morey already knew Harden wanted Paul traded, he alluded to it the night the team got eliminated by Golden State. Harden may have wanted a Westbrook for Paul swap, but Tilman was the one who stepped in and made the deal against Morey's wishes, knowing we were parting with way too many picks."
"the best timeline: after he wins one in brooklyn, old man harden goes back to houston (when tilman isn't owner anymore) to pair up with cade cunningham and chris paul, with russell westbrook coming off the bench(still averaging 10/10/10 on 10 turnovers) wins a ring."
Now do Chris Paul as a Paul.
Then there's Chris Paul who refuses to join this party.
"&gt;They'd call it a flagrant depending on the landing  Yep, just like how they didn't call Chris Paul for a flagrant when [he shoved Giannis in the Finals.](https://i.imgur.com/S12u0WR.png)"
"Because the way you described it above shifts *all* of the blame/pettiness to Ray Allen, completely absolving the Celtics for their part in it. You make it sound like Allen didn't like Rondo for some reason and was like ""fuck the Celtics, I'm going to their rival"" like Ainge and the franchise played zero part in his negative feelings there. They tried to trade him, and as a result he no longer felt wanted, so he left. That's perfectly understandable.   The same thing happened with my team when the Chris Paul trade was vetoed by the league and Lamar Odom no longer felt wanted by the Lakers and asked to be traded. It would be dishonest of me or anyone to say that was all Odom's issue and he was just petty. Don't you agree?"
Price effective chris paul
Are you actually trying to say that Dame is a better playmaker than Chris Paul? Like is this your actual truth?  EDIT: Dame also literally isn’t more efficient than Cp3. Out of the last 3 years the only year where Dame was more efficient was his last year in Houston.
That's because he is BETTER than Chris Paul
This guy has a higher career high in both points and assists than Chris Paul
"&gt;Flashy Hollywood trades  Lmao. All of the trades and FA signings we have made sense to the other teams. Was Charlotte really going to take on a 17 year old Kobe Bryant who they weren't thinking about drafting? Is it ""flashy"" that the Magic let Shaq go because they were stupid enough not to pay him the money he deserved? Or was it ""unfair"" that the Lakers got Pau Gasol despite giving the Grizzlies cap relief in Kwame Brown (we offered Lamar Odom originally) and their franchise player Marc Gasol? Is it also ""flashy"" that an already agreed to 3 trade team to get Chris Paul was veto'd because Mark Cuban and Dan Gilbert bitched to David Stern?   Stop trying to discredit the Lakers moves as ""luck just because they are in Los Angeles."""
I hate chris paul
"Draymond is a playmaker. He was tied with Chris Paul for the 3rd most assists/game in the NBA last year.  Rodman, not so much. He would be nothing out on the 4l3-point line, on either side if the ball."
&gt; You also want curry with the ball in his hands but guess what?  They are different players with different strengths.  Harden is flat out better on-ball than Steph is and Steph is flat out better off-ball than Harden is.  Harden since his early Houston days has never played with a ballhandler remotely as good as he is.  This is counting Westbrook and that first Chris Paul year.  There is maybe one player worth taking the ball out of Harden's hands in the league and it's LeBron.
Not as many times as Chris Paul has flopped in his career
All my homies hate Chris Paul
"Well just looking at PG's drafted from 2005 onwards that made All-Star: Deron Williams, Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Goran Dragic, Steph Curry, Jrue Holiday when he was predominantly a PG, Jeff Teague (hah), John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, Isaiah Thomas, Damian Lillard, not going to count Oladipo as he mostly plays a lot of time at SG and the same will go for LaVine, D'Angelo Russell, Ben Simmons, Luka Doncic and Trae Young.  Gonna have to say you cannot disregard the history made by a lot of these guys. That said, I feel like OP has most likely the best 3 on the list. Curry will go down as the best shooter to exist until someone passes him of course. His 3 championships speak for themselves as he was basically the best player on the court for much of his playoffs. Russell Westbrooks triple double breaking is astounding as are his athletic highlights and the tenacity he exudes. Chris Paul is and will always be remembered as a leader, solid defender for his short size as well as a model of consistency that spread wherever he went regardless of team. His teams always found a way to win.  Honorable mentions are far and few between on this list. Rose and Wall were both insanely good prior to injuries. Kyrie Irving will always be overlooked on his title thanks to LeBron, but personally, I feel like he's always been a top 10 PG every year and in some cases top 5. Thomas had a cool couple of seasons that netted him a scoring title. Lillard has also been amazing but just hasn't found a way to win in playoffs, almost like TMac who put up great numbers but never found playoff success.  But as for who is going to rule the 2020's. That's probably going to go to Doncic and Young. I feel like Fox, LaMelo, Garland and maybe Simmons are going to have amazing contributions as well down the line. I say maybe for Simmons because I just feel like he could probably work better as a starting 4 working at the top of the key, as long as he can develop a jumpshot. This would of course not make him a PG.  And finally, no, LeBron is not up for discussion here."
Magic isn't even close to being close to Bird. The only reason they get brought up together is because the media tied them together while they were playing. It's like comparing Chris Paul and Deron Williams.
Chris Paul?

"Similarly, John Stockton’s assist record is out of reach from the likes of Chris Paul"
Chris Paul deserves a mention.
The record doesn’t show otherwise.  Everything you said was a lie.  Allen Iverson won nothing compared to CP3.  He wasn’t a part of winning teams.  He’s not better than Chris Paul
"You said it was ""an obscure internet forum."" RealGM was the site to talk about basketball then, millions of users.  The claim was *""From 2005 until at least the 2009 LeBron Magic series it was just accepted that Kobe was the best in the league. No debates, no friendly conversations, no discussion about others. It was Kobe, no question.""*  What that thread does is allow us to go back in time and literally see a group of random basketball fans discuss who the best player was. Just looking at the first page you get 3 Lebron's, 2 Chris Paul's, 1 person saying it's a 4-way tie with Lebron, Paul, Kobe and Duncan.  So that's it for that absurd statement."

Chris Paul as defence ????
Didn’t he just push Chris Paul from behind during a timeout. How many chances does this guy get.
"Underrated one but Chris Paul with Tyson Chandler in New Orleans was dirty, chandler has 193 dunks in 2007-2008 and 29 more in the playoffs.  Paul with Griffin was filthy as well. Gobert led the league with dunks this year with 175 and Giannis was second with 133 for reference"
"Any doubt there was regarding this was put away when he shoved Chris Paul when the game was over. “Scrappy defense” player dives at knees, knees LeBron in his reported groin injury on Christmas, broke Booker’s nose, gets lots of flagrants and techs, and then shoves another player with his back turned because he’s butthurt his team lost. S C U M B A G"
Stockton's assist record. Chris Paul would need to play 6 more full seasons averaging 10 assists a game to leapfrog him.
Played AAU/high school ball with Devin Vassell and Anthony Edwards. Met Chris Paul when i was 10. Teammates with Josh Okogie in high school. Played against Marvin Bagley in the 8th grade and plenty of other future NBA players.  Here I am Chegging my way to a bachelors degree
"We’re talking about an entire career, not one finals run.  Chris Paul consistently played better competition and performed better.  Chris Paul choked 16 years into his career(even though he closed out the clippers with 40+ and just had to get surgery for an injury he got in round 1) but AI  was out of the league 16 years into his career.  One year doesn’t make you a better player for the whole career   If you like seeing a guy take 35+ shots and shoot 39% in an L, take AI all day.  I’m taking Chris Paul 10 times out of 10"
Reggie Miller said Chris Paul was the MVP this year  Fans will rightfully clown players for all their terrible takes but then when they say Kobe is the GOAT or whatever it's illegal to disagree
garnett  lebron  Paul george (more so in his pacers and okc days but i still like him)  Chris Paul  westbrook
"Chris Paul is about 900 steals short, LeBron is about 1,200 short. Westbrook would need to double his total.   I don’t see any current player with a chance at reaching it."
19 rockets were clearly much worse than 18.   Chris Paul looked like he fell off a cliff and they lost key role players because Fertitta is cheap
"We’re talking about which player is better.  Chris Paul is better at basketball.  Chris Paul does more that contributes to winning.  If you’re trying to actually win, everyone is taking Chris Paul over Allen Iverson"
"Lmao so winning one game is an accomplishment.  See how wild you sound, Chris Paul had a much tougher warriors team down 3-2.  Allen Iverson can be a first round out or not even make the playoffs for over 10 seasons, and that 1 finals win makes years of playoff runs and 50 win seasons irrelevant? You don’t honestly believe that."
"Jokic, Garza, and Chris Paul in the next dunk contest."
"Seriously. Next closest active player is Chris Paul at like 2/3 of the record. If LeBron somehow was able to play for another 10 years and didn’t deteriorate too much he could maybe break it, but it’s unlikely."
"Yep. Bad pick ≠ bust. Chris Paul was selected one spot after Deron Williams, who had a very good overall NBA career and certainly was not a bust."
"And Chris Paul won 2 games in the finals.  Who the fuck did the Sixers beat in the east?  Nah, that one win ain’t worth more than a career of winning, especially from a consistent first round loser"
Chauncey Billups should be ranked higher than Chris Paul and Steve Nash all time rankings.
"well chris paul is a dirty fucker, he would 100% have been trying to injure giannis there"
No it’s like saying Marvin Williams is a bust because he’s not Chris Paul.
"Chris Paul contributes more to winning and raises his teammates level of play.  Everyone CP3 played with played better than they ever have him and the teams had their best success.  David West arguably never gets an all star if he doesn’t play with CP3.  Tyson Chandler was almost out of the league, Chicago gave him up for nothing and it was accepted he was a bust, until he played with CP3.  Before or after CP3, Blake never had a winning record (until he joined brooklyn), DJ almost doesn’t seem relevant since CP3 hasn’t played with him, Harden and the rockets won 67 games and Harden got an MVP.  Chris Paul makes your team better because he runs the offense, plays defense (not just passing lanes) and he doesn’t force 30 shots a game.  He’s a better leader too, he’s twice been sent to teams who were expected to do nothing, one of them full of rookies he got them the same record as the team that traded him and took them to game 7, and he just led a young Suns team to the finals.  With Chris Paul you’re not gonna have a losing record or miss the playoffs, in the WEST.  Back when below .500 teams were making the playoffs in the east, Iverson missed a few times"
"Unsolicited story time, but extremely relevant:  Once sat mid-level in MSG for $34 (!) by buying tix a few minutes after tip-off that we still had stress scramble to find fucking physical printing for to get in, lucked out at a nearby Kinkos, and it was to see our hometown Spurs late in the season coming off their back to back finals + revenge on the Heat. Truly glory days as a transplant in NYC during the years both Knicks and Nets were absolute true garbage - the KD signing was the death knell for this era, as I attended the Barclays versions of this game every year for the price of a beer or less till then too.   That Spurs @ Knicks game ended up being a deep cut in terms of what led to the current state of the team, too - from memory, Melo had been sat for the season so Knicks were like, 15 win team a month or two away from drafting (and booing of course) Porzingod, and playing a fully healthy all-time solid Spurs squad, pacing for 60+ wins or already there, but somehow pushed to OT on an Alexy Shved give-n-go and-1 in the final minute of play. We thought, oh hell yeah, more basketball in MSG! Then the Spurs lost.   This was such an aberration so late in the season and major blight on the win % of a defending champion that ESPN put out a stat the next day saying no team with that high of a record had EVER lost that late in a season to a team with that bad of record - seriously a crazy outlier but lost in the news and seemingly inconsequential…  But it was so tight a race for playoff seeding in the West that this one loss ultimately cost us the high probability for 2nd seed (as it was at the time) and we ended up I believe 5th?, leading to a 7-game first round series versus the Chris Paul is god I hate very much Clippers and the WORST officiating on a pivotal series defining final play I have ever seen to date. All from memory, but the shot clock and game clock starts were out of sync on our final play, drawn up out of a timeout, and AFTER our routes and positioning things had been ran and ball inbounded the refs forced stoppage for a redo. No chance at surprise now, last play of a game 7 series, and Jesus… this Knicks game haha. MSG. Alexy Shved. Kawhi, Duncan, Parker, Manu, hell, even Jonathan Simmons. It’s a blur after this to be honest.   I’m convinced that loss cost us the team as we know it, and I was there."
"Chris Paul has played with other hall of famers while they’re in their primes, Allen Iverson got a well past his prime Dikembe Mutumbo and a pre-prime Melo. Wins aren’t the be all end all of basketball discussions either"
Part of the “greatest” moniker (IMO) is how exciting a player is.  Chris Paul is an all time great PG but mans game is a snooze fest when compared to Iversons.
At ine point Chris Paul made jokes about Hardens man-boobs
"Rondo was never going to be a top 5 point guard though and I doubt that’s something that bothers the guy.  Absolutely not an afterthought role player either, as a laker fan I *hated*the guy on that Celtics team.  Without him being so good that big3 team doesn’t win a chip, hell Phil Jackson was giving the guy credit for closing out the series.  Playoff Rondo then has the most assists by a bench player in playoff history and helps the lakers win 2020.  I hate the guy but at minimum he’s got two of the largest fan bases in basketball that have him ingrained in their heads.  People will remember Chris paul for never winning a chip and being a dirty player."
"What do you think happened when Chris Paul first arrived in Houston? Do you think James Harden met him up for drinks, played pickup B-ball like a normal human being? Fuck no. That's human. James Harden is inhuman, the embodiment of transcendence that occurs only when a spirit truly slips the surly bounds of his human enclosure. Rather, Harden invited Chris Paul over. He lit candles, put on a nice song. Poured some wine. Laid out some bananas and a boat. I know where you think this is going- but Harden doesn't have any sexual desires. He's immune. Not erect. Chris Paul entered the house, visibly shocked at the internal decor of Harden's Houston pad. Harden remained straight-faced.  Suddenly, Poker Face by Lady Gaga blared over Harden's disco speakers. Harden closed his eyes, seemingly falling into a dormant stupor of a drunken comatose paraplegic. Without moving his lips, he invited Paul to sit near him. Telepathically. Paul, visibly shaking, moved over to Harden. He was suddenly captured by an unspeakable force. Paul realized he wasn't in the world anymore. No. He was... he was sitting atop a mountain. He glanced to his right. James Harden was nude in a bib and apron making pork chops and broccoli. Perhaps it was stir fry? A fitting dinner for Paul's first night out? ""You see, Paul, this is how I make connections with my teammates"" Harden spoke, without turning around. ""Do you think Dwight was willing to watch me cook stir fry nude on a mountaintop? Fuck no. Do you think any of my previous coaches were willing to have a candlelight virgil while Pokerface played? Fuck no. But you, Christoffer, I see potential in you.""  ""Come over here. Touch my fucking beard.""  So Chris Paul walked over in a state of amazement and vague apprehension. He extended a single finger as James turned around, eyes and mouth zipped shut. His face became utterly expressionless; all that was left to notice was the beard. So Paul grabbed it. Suddenly, they were transported back to Harden's pad in Houston. Everything appeared normal. Harden spoke one last time to a visibly shaken Paul.  ""You don't even want to know what Russell makes new teammates do.”"
I'll also add that it was very apparent that the USA Team itself was as thin on super talent as it'd ever been since NBA players had been allowed to participate. Here's who opted out:  * Shaquille O'Neal  * Kobe Bryant  * Vince Carter  * Tracy McGrady  * Kevin Garnett (2004 MVP)  * Ray Allen  * Jermaine O'Neal  * Jason Kidd  * Kenyon Martin  * Paul Pierce  * Baron Davis  * Ron Artest  * Michael Redd  * Chris Webber  * Ben Wallace
" all the people who chatted shit and fired off hot takes about this team can fuck off. acting like you know anything about the suns when you haven't watched us play in the last 10 years talking about how Chris Paul is suddenly an MVP candidate when nobody bought that he was a top 5 pg before the season started just because he was old. talking about how dumb we were to let TJ Warren go for cash when he wasn't able to stay on the floor to begin with. talking about how booker is overrated when you haven't seen him play more than twice. talking about how dysfunctional this organization has ""always"" been when you didn’t know anything about it before you read some reddit comments this morning look at where we are now. champions of the world. suck my ass"
Jordan did not see the same amount of doubles as harden. Harden is being picked up immediately and doubled at half. Also it’s a bit unfair to compare their careers this way Jordan was on a great bulls team for many years and was always the main guy. Harden got to Houston late and was surrounded by no one else good until he got Chris Paul for 2 years. It’s also worth noting that Chris Paul was injured both years he played with harden. It’s easier to score and do what you want when you have a good team around you which harden just didn’t have. The defence is always fully focused on him and he has zero help.
"Are you trolling?  Harden was a Sixth Man in OKC, I aint talking about those days. Im talking prime for prime.  Curry always had Draymond, Klay, Iggy and a great bench and then traded that bench for KD.  Dwight Howard isnt on the level of all that fire power and neither is Chris Paul or Russell Westbrook.  If you really think Curry hasnt had the better supporting casts for his prime, you gotta take the homer glasses off. The fact the Warriors made the WCF without him playing in the first 2 rounds in 2016 says it all."
"In twenty years Chris Paul will be ranked much lower than people currently have him, and I dare say that in twenty years he won't even be considered a Top Ten Point Guard of All Time."
Wow arent jazz fans the ones who want to bring up his longevity based records? But now you’re saying him being awful in the finals is excused because of age?  Chris Paul is the same age rn as Stockton was during those finals.  Cp3 this finals: 22/8 on 55/52/75  Stockton in those finals: 10/9 on 49/22/72  CP3 &gt; Stockton and it isn’t even close
"Well we have seen that isn't really the case a lot lately. Guys like Nash and Stockton were still star until they were 37/38. Curry had an amazing season at 33. Kobe was still awesome until he did his own achilles and being a few years younger with better medical procedures will help Klay. Chris Paul whilst not in his scoring prime is still as effective as ever. And teams are evidently banking on KD, Kawhi, Pg13, Dame etc. To all be effective into their mid 30s otherwise they are paying them 50 mil a year to be poor."
JJ Redick    PG - Luka Doncic   SG - Vince Carter   SF -  Jimmy Butler   PF - Zion Williamson   C - Dwight Howard    BENCH   PG - Chris Paul   SG - Jrue Holiday   SF - Brandon Ingram   PF - Rashard Lewis   C - Joel Embiid
Yeah a fucking ridiculous list for him to be on. 3 all nba seconds and one third. Behind Chris Paul
You really going to try and say Chris Paul guards kd better than kawhi?

Totally get all that but there's also knowing when to hold them and fold them. Once Edwards got to his launch pad *realistically* he wasn't getting blocked unless prime Serge popped out.  Sometimes the offense gets the better of you.  You don't have to exacerbate it by showing you're going to give effort even when it's dumb. Take the shit out and get it back on the opposite end.    A great example is the Chris Paul foul on Giannis.  Realistically what the fuck was he going to do other than what happened?
"I'd worry about those teams holding up as well this season after such a short off-season (training camps open in a month). This especially will apply to the guys who then went and played in the Olympics, but also I'm worried about how well Chris Paul will hold up at his age (this is the first time in his career he won't have had a long off-season), and Jae Crowder who played in back to back Finals, with consecutive shortened off-seasons."
"LaMelo is already better than Lonzo lmfao  Lonzo has like no touch on his shots. I would rlly not be surprised if this past year was the best year of his career. Additionally, he's elite as a transition playmaker, but his playmaking in the half court is still dwarfed by guys like Chris Paul or LeBron or Jokic, despite what his stans will tell you"
"Lol what are you even talking about. Harden took us to the playoffs every year and we advanced 5/8 times, and he made the finals and conference finals in OKC. Hardens best chance Chris Paul got hurt before they could beat the best team ever. Didn’t wade post shaq pre bron get fucked round 1 every season?"
Jr Smith for the culture   AI Kyrie Chris Paul J Kidd Lebron Melo  Stat AD  Dwight Howard Delevedova
They honestly got bailed out by Chris Paul not playing
"That’s tough because no one really plays the game like that anymore and it was pre-three-point. I’ll go with Chris Paul though because of a similar team-first, win-at-all costs approach to the game."
That makes the lebron and jr moment the Chris Paul and Deandre Jordan moment recreated..
He got it because he was healthy. His competition was the 8th seeded Steph and  Chris Paul
Ben Simmons + Chris Paul is basically a better taller lebron lol
"Without relying on combinations of two all-time-greats;  * Ben Simmons + Chris Paul. This is mostly an excuse to get Chris Paul in a 6'11 body with good rebounding.  * Khris Middleton + Zion Williamson. Shoot from anywhere in defenders faces, Zion's touch at the rim - you'd have to bite on a pump fake, and before you land he's dunked it. Also get Zion with good defense and a bit more height.  * KAT + Steven Adams. There's better options, but it'd just change the rules for what either teams can do with picks; other team doing a pick and roll? Absolutely not. Your team runs a pick and pop? Easiest points you'll ever score."
Yeah definitely 1. Steph Curry 2. Chris Paul 3. James Harden 4. Luka Doncic 5. Damien Lillard 6. Mike Conley 7. Jrue Holiday 8. Trae Young  9. Malcom Brogdon 10.De’aaron Fox
"I'm not going to lie when I read the title these are not the teams I was expecting lol, and I would probably pick the Spurs as well but the 2018 Rockets, they took the Kevin Durant Warriors to seven games and did not have Chris Paul in the final two games oh, and had it not been for some very low IQ bad basketball they probably win game 7"
"Of course it’s a mistake now that we are able to look back on it. But at the end of that 2019 season, when Chris Paul was averaging career lows at 34 and was widely considered to have the worst contract in the league, I don’t blame us for making the trade for Westbrook at the time.   No one had any clue that Chris changing to a plant based diet would make that much of a significant change. Hell, when Chris joined the thunder he had like a 2% chance of making the playoffs, his comeback after 2019 was totally unprecedented.   At the end of the day, the rockets after that 2019 season were in a win now mode, which made them desperate to trade Chris for any star. Not to mention, Harden and Westbrook at one point we’re averaging insane numbers and the rockets were rolling, just didn’t translate to the playoffs, especially matching up with the Lakers."
"I mean we’ve done that once in the last few seasons, this year. You can argue that he won’t be better than all the players picked behind him, but you really can’t know that until we actually see them all play and he seems to fit with the FO’s current timeline pretty well. We have by no means drafted well, but we’ve had 4 top 15 picks in the past 12 years. Those picks were Paul George, a trade for George Hill, Myles Turner, and Chris Duarte. I wouldn’t say that’s particularly bad."
"People forget this, but New Orleans Chris Paul had a lot of bounce. He’s definitely athletic."
"Hahaha just watch the Knicks nuggets brawl for melo's punch. And Chris Paul had tons beyond the undercut there's a compilation on YouTube 5 min long. Maybe the lebron undercut isn't that bad but like I said I have bias as a sixers fan  Just because you let your emotions pour over once and shove someone doesn't make you a bad person lmao that's stupid af. He literally admitted he fucked up  Edit: also correction, I thought melo punched nate but it looks like he punched mardy collins"
"Dwade broke rondo's arm and has a shit ton of others  Chris Paul has a shit ton of dirty plays just look them up. Most recent one was him undercutting lebron  Melo sucker punched nate Robinson   I'm biased as a sixer fan, but lebron undercut embiid, definitely more dangerous than a shove though"
"I don’t like pat bev at all. But I think people definitely ovverracts to stupid shit. Chris Paul, dwade, melo, and lebron all have moments worse than that shove"
Except he would totally have to relearn his shooting motions from having new arms and hands.  Chris Paul would basically be the only good basketball player left.
Would he not have Chris Paul´s body? With Steph´s skill?
Anyone but Chris Paul
Fuck Chris Paul still
"It’s not just about Fox’s performance. I like him a lot. Underrated for sure. I’m more worried that he is more John Wall than Chris Paul. If that makes much sense. Fox is going to get his buckets, but can he elevate a team? Could just be the Kings stink. I’d just like to see him playing somewhere else. See if he can do more."
He *shoved* him omg you're right that's horrible  And wow Chris Paul is such a sweetheart can't believe he would do that to him
Chris paul because he wouldn't have to adjust
Chris Paul cus he’s had a 35 year head start in learning  Guys like KD would be g league
"Love the love from a Spurs fan for Garnett.   KG's peak was so high, and I really wish he had won a championship that MVP year.   People don't recognize just how good his 2003 season was.   It's a top 30 season of all time. By win shares that peak KG year is better than the best seasons of Tim Duncan, Kobe, Dirk, Steph Curry, Karl Malone, Chris Paul, Jerry West.  By VORP that season is the 10th best season of all time.  That year KG was Michael Jordan in 1996 level of play.  But alas, he was surrounded by awful players his whole career, and my favorite player will probably be forgotten because he only got one ring."
This is an all time great highlight.   We've all felt the same type of way towards someone as Chris Paul felt towards DJ there. This play cuts deep at an emotional level.
"The Houston Rockets roster with no Chris Paul was definitely worse than a roster with Steph, KD, Klay, Green."
Bad for Chris Paul and bad for the league are massively different things
Disagree. Mitchell needs his 30 shots per game. Suns offense doesn’t allow for that. Also Mitchell lost two game In a row to a clippers team missing their best player. Booker beat them twice in a row withour Chris Paul. You don’t know what you’re talking about
"&gt;Losing the the Warriors in 2018 is NOT a choke  In game 6 he was up 17 after the 1st quarter and up 10 at halftime. Ended up losing by 29. Game 7 he was up 11 at halftime then missed 10 of the rockets' 27 straight 3s.  &gt;he took them to 7 games  In the Rockets' 3 wins vs GS in 2018, Harden had: 76 points, 11 assists, 12 turnovers on 25/71 FGs, and 6/38 3 pointers. Eric Gordon had 65 points, 4 assists, 1 turnover on 18/44 FGs, 10/27 3 pointers in the same 3 games.  Does Eric Gordon also get some huge legacy boost for ""taking the 2018 warriors to 7 games"" like Harden gets credit for? Chris Paul was the Rockets leader and best player this series.  &gt;I can easily bring out three bad/terrible game by Superstars recently  No other superstar has the long history of constantly disappointing in big games almost every year like Harden."
2020 and 2021 all star Chris Paul?
Chris Paul?
How is 36-year-old Chris Paul still so good?
Yes. Chris Paul might get out in round 1
Chris Paul winning this year might *actually* be the worst MVP in the history of the league
&gt; Chris Paul deserves the MVP.  Statistically Chris Paul shouldn't be sniffing the MVP.
Chris paul lmaooo
Thought he meant more that Chris Paul has been criticized for not making it deep into the playoffs (as opposed to the eastern conference which wasn't as strong for a while) 🤷
"&gt; Again, Randle’s rebounds per game are inflated because he plays 40+ minutes a game.   This is part of what value is and what goes into single season awards playing alot. It's not a debate of the best players just who had the best seasons and how much you play for that matters just like games missed.   1st:   G: Doncic  G: Steph F: Giannis  F: Kawhi C: Jokic  2nd   G: Lillard  G: Harden  F: LeBron F: Jimmy Butler C: Embiid   3rd:  G: Chris Paul G: Kyrie Irving  F: Jayson Tatum F: Paul George  C: Rudy Gobert   Neither of us have Zion or Randle interestingly. Im not as high on Trae Young as you(doesnt pressure the rim and isnt a real off ball threat which keeps him from being the highest offensive tier for me) and probably thinks his defense is more harmful than you do but this is otherwise pretty close. I also probably dont put as much emphasis on efficiency as you which is probably where the Tatum disagreement would stem from. Both Randle and Zion were real close for me, I just think Tatum is a little better."
"First, I never said ""basketball is all about numbers."" So you can kindly withdraw your strawman argument.   But that said, numbers tell a large part of the story.   When I watched Iverson, I saw an inefficient chucker who wanted to play hero ball and was lucky to play in the east when it was so weak and have a crazy effective defensive team that covered for him on the other end of the court.   It's not a popular opinion, but it's how I see it.   There's a reason Iverson never got out of the first round when he was in Denver, despite playing on a far superior basketball team.   And I don't give a shit how tall a dude is: if a guy needs 30+ shot to get 31 points, he's not efficient enough to be giving 30 shots a game to. I'm not going to give him extra credit for scoring 30 because he's six feet.   I'll take a 6-foot John Stockton or Chris Paul over Iverson any day of the weak, because they aren't going to force shitty shots and stall the offense so they can show off their handles and put up a circus shot.   Kobe scored 30 a game in the same era, and he only needed 22 shots to do it. When they gave him 27, he dropped 35 a game. T-Mac scored 32 on 24 shots."
"Ahh yes. When I think leadership I think Kobe Bryant, Lebron James, Chris Paul, Udonis Haslem. Lol. Whhattbout whattabbout whattabout. Don't turn this about what you think about me, the subject is UD being an unnecessary part of the team and full time hanger on at this point in his career."
Chris Paul most likely.
He’s been listed as 175 for awhile now. I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s outdated. Because you’re right even on tv Chris Paul looks big as hell.
"I wonder if Chris Paul would get more mvp votes if the marketing was behind him.  I feel like no one mentions him as the best player on the 2nd highest wins team, especially in context of that team dramatically improving."
"I can think of Luka, Beal, Lillard, Steph and Chris Paul that could theoretically make it over him. Whose a sixth guard that you think would be chosen over Kyrie?"
"There's no guarantee you will dodge them because even if you dont play them in round one, and you beat your new round 1 opponent, you have to play either the team later on (if you were right to be scared of them and they are that good) or the team that beat them anyway.  Chris Paul said it best yesterday, if you wanna be an NBA champion you gotta be prepared to face anyone."
"That’s a really long winded way of saying those franchises were sold to better ownership with deeper pockets.         (Though the Clippers turned around before being sold, there were some Chris Paul trade shenanigans that made that happen. Almost none of it happened from free agency.)"
&gt;	So Chris Paul in 2018 and 2019 was the best playmaker ever?   No Chris Paul in 2018 helped run one of the best offenses of all time. In 2019 he regressed because of injury.   &gt;	Are you out of your mind lol? He wasn’t even the teams leader in assists  It’s called *creation*—something if you’re a fan of harden should know that doesn’t show up in the box score metrics—where you don’t rely on PPG/shooting splits/unadjusted plus minus. Harden is an all time great creator. So is chris paul.
So Chris Paul in 2018 and 2019 was the best playmaker ever? Are you out of your mind lol? He wasn’t even the teams leader in assists
&gt;	Lol Chris Paul in Houston wasn’t even close to “best playmaker ever”  Don’t be delusional Paul is an all time guard who crushes the league in impact every year. Morey knew what he got: another top 10 player who can run and playmake his own offense while harden rests.   You can’t compare them to the warriors. Or you can as morey did say they were *designed* to beat them. But even then you have raw talent which sometimes simply beats your system that won 65 regular season games (all timenhistoric offense) even though you did everything pretty much right.   Harden bringing the warriors to 7 and 6 (actually every year he lost to them) is more than Durant did against golden state (Durant had prime WB and a defensive anchor in ibaka and secondary playmaking on the bench).   We all know the real finals were in 2018
Lol Chris Paul in Houston wasn’t even close to “best playmaker ever”  When he was good that one year they had Steph and KD beat so that shows you how good harden does with help
"I get the point perfectly. We’re seeing the same thing in a different light.   The West is tough in the playoffs.  Any team will have a rough go in the West playoffs.  Chris Paul has been in the West his entire career and in the playoffs for the majority of his career. So naturally he has been in some tough playoff series his entire career.  This isn’t singling out Chris Paul as the only one who has to bear some terrible burden of being in the West. That would be silly. But this is a thread where Chris Paul talked about his career with respect to the playoffs, so naturally people will talk about how tough he’s had it in the playoffs."
"There would something weirdly poetic about him finally going to Phoenix with Monty (the coach of the team he wanted to leave) and Chris Paul (the guy he was traded for). It's not a poem I like, but that would be some real full circle shit"
Not to mention the players who can shoot midrange shots ala Chris Paul  destroy him in the postseason. I think players can’t take a guy seriously who wins multiple DPOY awards and has been played off the court in the playoffs.
"You probably know some of these names but they aren't in HOF yet and I think they should be or at least have an argument to be considered:  Cavs: Larry Nance, Brad Daugherty, Mark Price, Austin Carr  Kings: Chris Webber, Peja Stojakovic, Wayman Tisdale  Pistons: Ben Wallace, Lambeer, Chauncy Billups, Rip Hamilton  Sonics/Thunder: Shawn Kemp, Detlef Schrempf, Dale Ellis   Blazers: Rasheed Wallace, Rod Strickland  Warriors: Tim Hardaway, Latrell Sprewell   Suns: Kevin Johnson, Amar'e, Shawn Marion, Tom Chambers   Rockets: Rudy Tomjanavich, Otis Thorpe, Steve Francis   Magic : Penny Hardaway   Heat: Glen Rice, Bosh   Mavericks: Rolando Blackman, Michael Finley   Bulls: Horace Grant, Toni Kukoc  Lakers: Michael Cooper, Byron Scott, Eddie Jones   Bullets/Wizards: Gilbert Arenas   Spurs: Alvin Robertson  Hornets: Larry Johnson   Bucks: Sam Cassell, Vin Baker, Glenn Robinson   Pacers: Jermaine O'Neal   Grizzlies: Shareef Abdur-Rahim  Clippers: Elton Brand, Danny Manning   Jazz: Jeff Hornacek   Knicks: Marcus Camby, Charles Oakley  Celtics: Antoine Walker, Paul Pierce  Hawks: Mookie Blaylock"
"Chris Paul seems like one of those players that give 100% every night (hence his solid regular season resume), but when it comes to the playoffs, he doesn't have that higher gear, so he gets stopped up when everyone else raises their level of play during the playoffs... He pretty much needs a super team to win it all, he can't just be on a ""contender"" like during his rocket days or his clipper days, because he isn't good enough to win it all on most types of contender teams... Even if he was in the east, sure, he would make the conference finals at least a few times, but I don't think he'd have ever gotten past Boston / Lebron (or the Raptors the one year that Lebron wasn't in play.) It is what it is."
"Lillard, Chris paul, lebron."
"Seems like you really care about MVP chants lol. Every star gets MVP chants, they’re not always realistic. You do know that Chris Paul got MVP chants from the same crowd last week.   It is really weird that drunk fans at a Suns game are yelling MVP for Booker as he hit two free throws to win the game?   Do you know what victim complex means? Seems like you’re the one with a victim complex because when did we ever start talking about who was better between Book and CP?"
"No, clearly he need Chris Paul to have a chance. Chris gets hurt they lose, Chris gets traded they lose. Harden is the consistent loser in this."
Yeah narrative stuff same type of thing like how one or two people will probably vote Chris Paul over Nikola Jokic for MVP this year
Still has the MVP and he was injured lmaool cry Chris Paul is a choking bum
I actually think it's cool to see Lebron plays Chris Paul in the playoff for the first time.

"Chris Paul hit a game-winner off a Sombor Shuffle a couple weeks ago  Don't know that he actually meant to take it, though"
"Booker is your future but he hasn’t been the MVP for the Suns this season. It’s been Chris Paul, there’s a reason why he’s been getting placed in the top 3 lists for MVP discussion. MVP stands for most valuable player and CP3 has been your most valuable player this season. It was weird to see fans chant MVP to a guy who wasn’t even having a good game by his standards when his 36 year old running mate had 26 points with 7 assists on 11-14 shooting.    Keep having the victim complex though, it’s cute. No one thinks Booker is bad, it’s just that CP3 is a better player at the moment."
Cry Chris Paul is a guaranteed 2nd round exit every year
Ok? He still went to 4 WCFs and a Finals and won a MVP. Chris paul has 6 first round losses but nobody ever talks about that
"If he does leave I'd love for him to go to a team like the bulls. He's not quite as good as Chris Paul imo, but I could see him having the same effect on a young team's culture in the same way Chris did"
Chris Paul
Chris Paul for the first 2-3 years he’s on the team.  Any longer and players seems to get sick of listening to him.
"Anyone who has been watching basketball for the last 15 years knows Chris Paul is an amazing player that elevates whatever team he is on in a massive way. Over the last ten years, in my opinion, him and curry are the top 2 point guards. Looking forward to see how phoenix do in the play offs."
Chris Paul tryna shut me up
Hello police? Chris Paul about to tear up!
"Devin Booker played 65 games, Chris Paul played 68 games, Deandre Ayton played 69 games, Mikal Bridges played 69 games. Your team has been healthy the entire fucking season.  Quit lying LMFAO"
"How were the jazz heavy underdogs? And I already pointed out how amazing Paul was in that series haha your only argument is ""Joe Johnson was really good"". Way to go Joe! How is that a slight on Chris paul? 36 year old Chris paul swept your team this year too. The ""point false god"" really gets on your nerves for some reason"
"Chris Paul went 11/14, w/ 7 assists and was still -3?  Lmao."
Lmao foul if you have a giant pussy maybe. Go ahead and watch Chris Paul do the same shit to Lillard 20 times in a row with no calls before hand and then defend that stance.
Chris Paul tryna beat me up 😏😏😏
Thank u chris paul. Saric i had a whole paragraph copied and pasted for him
Lillard went to talk to his coach and Chris Paul went over to eavesdrop.  Classic.
"It's when you think / talk of / about someone / something non-stop, and there's a reason for that. Can be a crush. Can be hatred. There are feelings involved anyway.  It's not coincidental. **They're in your head.**  People think and talk about the Nets because they're the best NBA team right now. That doesn't mean they like or dislike them, it has nothing to do with their feelings. They just recognize that they're favorites to win the championship.  As I said, Blake Griffin = rent-free in my head. I fucking hate him. I see him smiling after a made 3 and I wanna punch the wall. The moment I hear the word ""Pistons"" I think of Blake Fuck That Flopper Griffin and he doesn't even play for the Pistons anymore. I read ""Chris Paul"" and I immediately make the connection to him throwing lobs for Blake in LA. In short, Blake lives rent-free in my head. I consider him to be a bad basketball player (in 2021) and I don't think he's a threat to my team. I just fucking hate him. I found out he leads the league in charges drawn yesterday and started hating him even more. Fuck Blake Griffin.  That's rent-free. People saying the Nets are gonna win or MJ is the GOAT are just stating facts."
Chris Paul briefly forgot how to dribble then remembered he's money in the midrange.
Chris Paul has been so good
Chris Paul got that Shaun Livingston mid range
Chris Paul what the fuck?
Dame is absolutely TORCHING Chris Paul. Just a layup line
Ugh Chris Paul needs to win it this year
imagine Chris Paul missing a midrange shot
I forget Booker is even playing. Chris Paul is carrying the suns rn
Chris Paul has less finals appearances than jimmy butler
L M A O   wanna know what the funniest part about this is?  Chris Paul has more all-nba nods than the whole Heat team...combined   Chris Paul has the most first or second team all nba selections than Jimmy has sniffed.... in his LIFE   Chris Paul has more all star appearances than the entire Heat roster...combined   Lmfao. Of course a trash ass take from a fan of a trash ass player. Apple doesn’t fall from the tree. Fuckin bums.
"Bruh stop the cap. SGA is a good ass player but if he wins an MVP I’ll eat a brick. D wade, Chris Paul, John Stockton, isiah Thomas all combine for 0 MVPs, the odds are overwhelmingly against. Plus it’s looking like Zion giannis and luka are gonna be making permanent cases and I can’t see SGA being at that level"
"I could not disagree with you more lol.   He's a good player. He's a great player even. Future hall of famer. But you are drinking the mainstream koolaid. ESPN has you wildin.   16 pts and 9 assists is not going to cut it when comparing him with Joker, Embiid, Giannis, or even Steph. Chris Paul isn't even top 10. This is so silly"
"Chris Paul has had a lot of playoff success. His individual stats are very good lol, his teams just kept getting injured."
"If i had to absolutely pick, I'd say Melo.  Chris Paul is an incredible two way player. Melo is an all time scorer who can, every once in a while, lock down on defense."
Chris Paul held a basketball camp for kids and surprise guest was MJ. CP announced that if MJ missed a single shot the entire camp would get free Jordans. MJ proceeded to make every shot and thus not a single kid got shoes
You’re a Chris Paul fan you can’t be bringing a player down for having a low PPG
Chris Paul   Kobe Bryant   Ron artsest   Pau Gasol  Dwight Howard
"C- Shaq  F- Scottie Pippen   F- Klay Thompson   G- Dwyane Wade  G- Chris Paul  Lots of lobs, lots of defense."
Chris Paul averaged 21.1 and 11.6 year 3 on 52.4 eFG%. And 11.0 assists year 4 with better scoring then injured his knee year beginning year 5...
"I know the media needs mvp narratives for content but in my opinion anything other than Jokic as the clear MVP is disrespectful to what he has been able to do this season. Not campaigning, not declaring that he’s the mvp, just going out and carrying his team despite injuries to major players. No matter what your criteria is for mvp, he checks more boxes than anyone else and it really isn’t close. Is he a top 5 player? Is he the best player on a winning team? Does he have the stats? Does he make his teammates better? Is he doing more with less than other players? It’s just absurd to me this whole bullshit around Chris Paul particularly and it’s nauseating to hear people continuing this story and pushing it so hard. Yeah he’s an all time point guard but does him exceeding expectations for what people thought he should be at this point in his career make him the MVP? Jokic just relies so much more on Jokic in my opinion."
okc has a very short history  but if i tries it would be   1-westbrook  2- durant  3- ibaka  4-steven adams  5- nick collison  6- paul george  7- james harden  8- chris paul  9- thabo sefolosha  10- shai gilgeous alexander  11-kendrik perkins  12- jeff green  or somethingh like that
Is Lowry the consensus? My GF always makes comments about Chris Paul.
"Including New Orleans Hornets as well  PG: Chris Paul  SG: Jrue Holiday  SF: Brandon ingram  PF: Zion  C: AD  6th Man: Boogie  Others:   David West, Baron Davis, Peja Stojakovic, Jamal Mashburn, Tyson Chandler, and idk, maybe David Wesley?"
yeah but nick wright says chris paul should be mvp because no one ever heard of jokic
You’re right. Chris Paul didn’t make the All Star team in ‘17 or ‘18 playing with Harden. Only until getting away from him did he return to All-Star form. I forgot about how poorly they played off each other.
"He isnt ""the only one"" - that was a poor statement. Im just a homer giving a pikachu face that dolla dame isn't even in the conversation here.  Looks like sportsbooks currently have MVP candidates in this order:  1. Jokic (-1900) 2. Embiid (+1450) 3. Curry (+1800) 4. Giannis (+4750) 5. Chris Paul (+9000) 6. T6) Doncic (+10000) 7. T6) Dame (+10000) 8. Lebron (+14500) 9.  Julius Randel (+15500) 10. Russ (+24000)  Basically ""Jokic in a landslide"""
Harden was great throughout the series.  Chris Paul playing like an overpaid role player was the issue there.
"I won't downvote you for the question. I think it's a legitimate convo.  But you're obviously in the minority.  Jokic is first in win shares this season, with a large lead over Rudy Gobert who's second. Luka is 14th.  Jokic is also a point-center, which is extremely rare and extremely useful. Luka's sort of a point-forward, but mostly just a point guard.  Jokic beats Luka in almost every advanced stat. Luka's metrics aren't (yet) translating to a bunch of wins.   TLDR: Beyond Lebron and Chris Paul, Jokic is probably the best floor general and that's what pushes him beyond Luka."
"&gt;This whole be narrative from Rockets fans  I'm a Pacer fan 1st but I'm a Warriors fan 2nd!  I was happy with the overall result of the series, but man that shit had me scared.  &gt;Even when they were healthier than the Warriors.  When they were healthier than the Warriors in 2017-18 they were beating them 3-2.  That was the Rockets' window, IMO.  They were simply not as well-constructed a team in 2018-19 as they were in 17-18. The lack of Ariza and Luc in particular may have seemed like ""oh just some role players"" but, no, those guys were quality veteran wing defenders, and the importance of these great role players to especially good teams is really understated. The front office simply failed to get good replacements for those skillsets that year.  And Chris Paul was just...having a bad overall season -- he was looking pretty washed for his standards and he missed a whole 1/3 of the season (his recent turnaround both health and play wise last two years is honestly pretty amazing)."
"&gt; They were outscored by 63 points in the series overall.   Just in case you didn't know, if you look at the [2017-2018 Pacers-Cavs series](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2018-nba-eastern-conference-first-round-pacers-vs-cavaliers.html) you'll see that we outscored the Cavs by 40 in the series overall.  And we lost.  As you can see, their only wins against us were very close wins, but we blew them out twice.  But did it matter how ugly a series win was? Did the ""everything elsewhere happened"" matter? No. LeBron went on to the Finals. It came down to little moments. And those moments didn't break our way.  That's the shit that happened to us. And, well, shit, that happened to Houston in their game 7 (and more largely, for their game 6/7 because Chris Paul, their 2nd best player, got injured). Completely independent event from the game 6 blowout -- we blew out the Cavs in game 6, too."
"Yeah it would be hard. Argument is he’s till entering his prime, looking like Lebron lite. You get another star and get rid of Elf and the team will surprise. Look at what Chris Paul did to the Suns. We’re one player away."
"This man just said a 34-year-old Chris Paul, Eric Gordon and James Harden is a superteam lol this sub cracks me up sometimes"
The only finals competition LeBron had that was tougher in scale than Jordan's were the two KD Warriors teams he faced. That's it  Even then...that second Warriors team was taken to 7 by Harden and Chris Paul
But that’s also part of the game. Chris Paul got dropped bad by curry but that didn’t undermine his defensive capabilities.   Same with pick up. I’d rather get dropped or dunked because I was playing d then them score because I didn’t want to get “embarrassed” by an a good player.
Any team he goes to just wins a lot more. Chris Paul is a legendary point guard who unfortunately just never got the squad or the health at times to get a chip
"Yeah, case and point, his 2019-2020 season with the Rockets. When Chris Paul and Eric Gordon were out, the next best people on the team were pretty much G-Leaguers. Harden carried that team so hard and in doing so, set a ton of scoring records. That team was the worst Rockets team during Harden's tenure, and he still did everything he did."
"Chris Paul go to hired that had nothing to do with harden “fucking it up” like he said. Dwight was not the best center in those years (demarcus cousins,joahkim noah, and even Tim was still better) Dwight had a role that he didn’t like and his back was still bothering him. A few role players does not make a super team (Gordon is also awfully inconsistent)"
"Chris Paul, James Harden, and Clinton Capela is a really solid big 3. I know Clint will probably get some hate to put him in a big 3... but if lebrons second run with the Cavs is considered a super team with kyrie and Kevin love, then so should that rockets squad."
"Chris Paul may not have the PPG to wow people, but if he's not a lock for top 5 over the last decade, I don't know what sport people are watching. He's consistently the most effective PG and, probably outside of LeBron, means the most to any team he's on. He literally elevates the game for everyone around him, not just hits shots."
The best years of Harden were with an amazing PG Chris Paul and now two other HOFers in Brooklyn
"Well - I think many people disagree with that statement, including me. Booker’s the best scorer on that team, for sure. But IMO Chris Paul orchestrates the majority of the offense, is a better passer &amp; defender.   When Booker’s shot isn’t falling he can be a net negative. Chris Paul is basically always a positive"
"All-NBA 1st Team  C: Nikola Jokic  F: Joel Embiid  F: Giannis Antetokounmpo  G: Luka Doncic  G: Steph Curry  All-NBA 2nd Team  C: Rudy Gobert  F: Julius Randle  F: Zion Williamson  G: Damian Lillard  G: Chris Paul  All-NBA 3rd Team  C: Bam Adebayo  F: Kawhi Leonard  F: LeBron James  G: Jimmy Butler  G: Paul George  &amp;#x200B;  Notable Snubs:  Tatum, Westbrook, KAT, Harden, Trae, Booker, Beal, Jaylen, Mitchell, Lavine, Kyrie."
"Wym 90%? Even curry, Chris Paul and kyrie drunks easily."
Why does everyone think Chris Paul is better than Booker? Booker is the best player on that team.
First Nikola Jokic Giannis Antetokounmpo Kawhi Leonard Damian Lillard Stephen Curry  Second Joel Embiid Julius Randle Jayson Tatum Luka Doncic Chris Paul  Third Rudy Gobert Zion Williamson Paul George Devin Booker Donovan Mitchell
Chris Paul allows the play-in to happen because he knew he’d knew it would make the Lakers play an extra game before their matchup with the Suns /s
"&gt;If KD never made that move  Nah it was the:  * Chris Paul hamstring injury * And even with that, a one-in-82000 or whatever insanely impossible odds event (whole team missing 27 threes in a row)  Like, you have to remember they were up on the Warriors by a lot even in that game 7 at halftime, and they only won by 9. 3 of those 27 actually makes it in and we're looking at an entirely different legacy for KD/the Warriors.  In 9 other universes out of 10 the Rockets have won that series -- we're just in the timeline wherein they didn't because of some honestly astronomically bad luck.  The Warriors were very much beatable that year, and the Rockets ABSOLUTELY had them figured out.  Just that really, just as much luck goes into winning most championships as skill does."
Harden wasn’t even good with Chris Paul on the court lol. I’m pretty sure they had huge leads in games 6 and first half of game 7 too. Harden just went missing
I read your comment now. It gets wilder.  In your earlier post you said  both teams had two top 10 level players but the difference was kd came through in game 7 while harden didn't. Yet you're failing to consider that the rockets game 7 team only had one star that GSW could double the entire game.   idk if you remember but chris paul got hurt in game 5.
"literally wasnt the only way for them to score points.  chris paul came through and said he needed to do more when the ball wasnt in his hands to help his teammates. showed a way to actually play ball that wouldnt be a one man show that fizzled out in the playoffs.  harden hated it so much they had to get cp3 out of there. couldnt rock w dwight in houston, couldnt rock w westbrook  and no single player in any sport has taken flopping as far as harden did. hes not even a soccer player and he outflopped them all. hes not just a normal ""flopper"""
Oh I know he was the 6th man but Donovan used that lineup during games and it was pretty successful  Read this https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2020/1/9/21057540/oklahoma-city-thunder-chris-paul-shai-gilgeous-alexander
"&gt; Devin Booker ON and Chris Paul ON +34 in 145 minutes (60%) &gt;  &gt; Devin Booker OFF and Chris Paul ON -37 in 40 minutes (17%) &gt;  &gt; Devin Booker ON and Chris Paul OFF -7 in 50 minutes (21%) &gt;  &gt; Devin Booker OFF and Chris Paul OFF +3 in 5 minutes (2%)   The moral of the story is that if you're going to take off one, take off both. /s"
Ok but now i wanna see Chris Paul breaking Bryn Forbes ankles and stepping over him
I was told the Chris Paul was carrying the Suns in the playoffs?
"The Scott Foster and Chris Paul shit is not just some coincidence my guy, there are clear biases and attempts at making games a lot harder for certain teams. I wouldn’t go as far to say it’s straight up rigged and predetermined, but certain officials will try their best to change the outcome for their benefit whatever that may be."
"I’m starting to think the nba hates Chris Paul, or whoever is in charge of ref scheduling."
"Scott is betting big on the Suns tonight. His career long tormenting of Chris Paul was clearly all a long con building up to this moment, to shift the line against the Suns and allow him to place a favorable bet."
"Zach also said (on a podcast, not OP's posted clip), that the Suns need to find some rest for Chris Paul. For example, on an after-basket possession, have someone else bring the ball up the floor so that Paul doesn't have Jrue in his face the entire time. The intensity is wearing Paul down over the course of the game."
"I kinda find it funny that we're just debating which side Foster is going to officiate towards, either to extend the series or to preserve his hate boner for Chris Paul, and that we **know** there is absolutely no middle ground where he actually has a moral compass and officiates the game fairly."
"Yes, because Devin Booker is the Suns' best player.  But also, this team is a two-headed snake and they don't really win without both of them being good. Chris Paul has been incredible and insanely valuable for us, it just sucks that he's gotten all the credit."
Are you serious? Did you see Chris Paul in the clippers and lakers series? In no way shape or form. Also you didnt watch the suns in the regular season Booker was clearly better.
"I don’t think home/away has much to do with it. He reffed the Lakers/Suns game because the NBA didn’t want their cash cow Lebron to lose in the first round.  He reffed game 3 of the Finals because it was 2-0 and the NBA couldn’t afford to have a series with already-low ratings go to 3-0 (literally only Suns fans would’ve watched game 4). Luckily the Bucks didn’t seem to need Foster’s trademark sketchy calls in game 3.  Now his job is to do whatever he can to help the Suns win and push the series to 7 games, which was always the NBA’s plan/goal (to make up for the low ratings). And it’s perfect because no matter how sketchy it is people can fall back on “well he hates Chris Paul, so there’s no way he’s helping the Suns”."
"And even if you take it at what CP3 said Scott Foster said, it isn't ""a ref blatantly telling a player he doesn’t like them"", Foster just told him that he reffed another Game 7 Chris Paul was in."
&gt; Scott Foster also reminded CP3 he also reffed his game 7 loss with the Hornets before another game 7 loss.  And your proof is what? Chris Paul? CP3 may be the most dishonest player in history.
"Ayton, Crowder, Chris Paul, Bridges. That’s 4 good defenders.  Lowry, Hart, Ingram, Zion, Adam. That’s 2 good defenders and they’re both the smaller guys.  If you didn’t think the Suns had a chance of being a good defensive team going into this season, you weren’t paying attention"
"Chris Paul is 36 years old, raise your expectations. Him throwing a tantrum at a ref after his foul-baiting fails is his problem, not the refs"
"&gt;Scott Foster also reminded CP3 he also reffed his game 7 loss with the Hornets before another game 7 loss.   Is there more to the story? Because that doesn't seem like a weird thing to say.   Like, if they walked over to each other and Foster is like ""hey, big game 7, we've been here before, I reffed that game 7 in New Orleans"". And I could imagine Chris Paul somehow taking that as an insult.   Unless Scott Foster is literally like an evil villain in a 90s movie who explains his crime to the victim before he commits it."
Jrue has completely erased Chris Paul since game 3
"You’re literally throwing all context out the window and cherry picking every bad shooting perfomance to act like that’s all he did. With people like you, you’re not arguing in good faith so you’ll never see the other side of the spectrum  Regardless, did he play bad in the 2012 finals? Yes, but he was also huge in every other series and was a huge reason they even beat the Spurs to make the finals  In 2013 we were the 8th seed.  Lmao in that 2015 series Corey Brewer and Josh smith averaged a 44% and 45% TS respectively. They both played like shit and were net negatives, the least they can do is hit some fucking threes for harden lol. I’m not sure how hardens entire series is discounted because of that, he averaged 25 and 8 on 60% TS and was huge in game 7, but of course you ignore that  https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2015-nba-western-conference-semifinals-clippers-vs-rockets.html  The warriors series was over after we went down 2-0 and nobody could provide harden with any help. It’s funny how you never acknowledge team contexts, whether it be help harden has or the strength of the opponent. I’m sure if it was your favorite player you’d be finding reasoning  too, but since it’s harden and you have this weird hate boner for him  Harden is stubborn as fuck when it comes to injuries so it’s not surprising be played through a concussion   https://bbs.clutchfans.net/threads/spurs-g5-6-finally-solved-was-harden-playing-through-a-concussion.286895/  Going to a night club doesn’t mean shit. There’s a difference between just being somewhere and playing playoff basketball lol  You put blame on him for blowing those games 6 and 7 leads but you won’t actually give him any credit for getting those leads in the *first place* considering he’s 1 lone guy going against the most unfair team of all time, who, by the way, we’re losing to him until Chris Paul went down. And needed refs to still beat him  Why would I care about a poor shooting game 7 when he contributed in other ways and was overall still great in the series even though he was guarded by one of the best defenders in the league? And his supermax teammate couldn’t even play?  Our losses to the lakers were by a large amount of points so by the time the 4th quarter comes the game is already out of reach. You’re acting as if these were some down to the wire games where harden dissapeared, no, he put up 30 and 8 on 65% TS playing 4 on 5 basketball. Westbrook sucked dick.  2021 he dominated the celtics I don’t give a fuck how ass you think they are he put up 29/8/10 on 76% TS nobody just does that.   Shit ass argument foh"
"SCOTT WITH THE QUADRUPLE TECH ON CHRIS PAUL, HE'S OUT FOR THE REST OF THE SERIES. WHATS THIS? BOOK WITH THE 4PT PLAY!"
"I honestly think the NBA is astroturfing some of this shit. Foster has been considered a shady ref for years, and still would be if he never reffed a game for Chris Paul ever.   It’s odd how all these people are saying ‘oh but he’s not actually made any bad calls the past few Suns games’ as if that’s the only issue people have with him."
Chris Paul will blow a playoff lead. History repeats indeed
Chris Paul is either going to drop 43 points in Game 6 for the win or he's going to go 6/18 with 5 turnovers and the Suns lose.  Nothing in between.
"Well Chris Paul must rest tonight, only chance for the suns"
"The offensive ball movement didn’t break down in the 3rd quarter because of him, he was the only person actually getting good looks for us. The Bucks have done an amazing job on Chris Paul, which has forced CP3 to dribble much more and move the ball much less.   He’s hunts contact, gets to the free throw line, and complains considerably less than Luka, y’all’s boy on this sub."
"1 minute into Game 7:  ""Hello LAPD? Send help - Chris Paul is trying to kick my ass"""
"So is Scott Foster gonna rig the game in favor of the Bucks because he hates Chris Paul, or rig it in favor of the Suns so the NBA gets an extra finals game (and more $$$)?"
So you still have no proof scott foster has a vendetta against chris paul lol . Youre the idiot pal.
no one likes Chris Paul so it’s fine
RIP Chris Paul
Here’s a quick rundown on how to react to this in case anyone needs it:  If the Bucks win then it’s rigged because Scott Foster hates Chris Paul and never lets him win.  If the Suns win then it’s rigged because Scott Foster was told by the powers that be to ensure that the series goes to a seventh game.
He has no evidence outside of chris paul crying about it in the clippers series. Because why would chris paul lie?
"SCOTT FOSTER WITH THE **CHAIR** ON CHRIS PAUL, HE IS SHOWING NO MERCY WITH 5 SECONDS LEFT IN THE GAME, BUCKS UP 2. BOOKER WITH THE CLUTCH 3, BANGGGGGG WE ARE GOING TO GAME 7!!! CHRIS PAUL LOOKS LIKE HE IS INJURED BY SCOTT FOSTER!"
"Jrue on CP with the full-court press has definitely disrupted his rhythm, it's up to CP and the Suns to counter it. The way he needs to counter that is being more aggressive IMO. He needs to take the first shot that comes open rather than dribbling through and pulling it out again.  If Chris Paul is taking and making those shots, it likely changes how Milwaukee is guarding him which opens up a ton more for Ayton and others."
Tbh it's not even rigged. Chris Paul just has a tendency of losing big games and those are what Scott Foster refs
"Yeah actions have consequences and it might not be immediate but people will not put up with this shit forever. Random comparison but the NBA right now reminds vaguely of the video game developer/publisher blizzard after they were bought out by Activision. They started implementing very malicious business practices immediately and longtime fans could see right through it and were furious. Blizzard had garnered so much good faith in the decades before being acquired by activision that it took a very long time to wear off. Over a decade later it seems like the consequences have finally landed and blizzard have forever tarnished their name in gaming spheres for the sake of squeezing their customers for as much money as they can. Feels like what we’re seeing here, same as how every professional sports league has slowly changed the rules to greatly favor the offense because they think that’s all people wanna see. I come to sports to engage in the spirit of competition and to me that means as even a playing field as possible. I hate the idea that flopping is an “efficient way to get points so why wouldn’t you do it” instead of just agreeing it’s not remotely in the spirit of basketball, it’s not a basketball play, and the players who engage in it are forgoing their dignity as a competitor, not outsmarting the competition. Nobody thinks Chris Paul or the Suns are “outsmarting” the Bucks by flopping, they look like little bitches who are trying to manipulate the spirit of the game in their favor."
Breaking: Chris Paul loses a lot of big playoff games
"If Chris Paul wanted a ring, he should never have come to Phoenix. He moved there for various reasons, including being close to his family.     It won’t be Paul’s fault if Milwaukee wins. Blame the Suns ownership and organized crime. Look at the physical size of Milwaukee’s line up compared to the Suns. Small ball with a limited roster of top healthy talent has been the Suns play for decades. Pay one franchise player for years and years. The AZ Cardinals did the same thing with Larry Fitzgerald."
"The question should be more, how many games has Chris Paul been favored in with Scott Foster and lost in the last 13."
"If it’s so easy and you’re so adamant about making the point, why not post a link? A google search of “Chris Paul, Tim Donaghy, Scott Foster” yields nothing but random articles about how Foster and Donaghy were friends and Foster and Paul’s history"
The stat looks more impactful when you do Chris Paul is 0-11 or 0-10 (can't remember the number)
The NBA hates Chris Paul
"The refs already gave Booker a pass. Scott Foster doesn't think Chris Paul needs one, otoh"
"Devin Booker was literally an ""empty stats""(which doesn't really make sense) guy until Chris Paul came along. I don't know how you said he has an impact on the game but not Bradley Beal."
"&gt;Eh idk man who goes through all the trouble of saying what you said as a joke lol  What trouble? It took 2 minutes to type out haha.  &gt;On top of that it clearly wasn’t really a joke lol.  I dislike the guy as a player sure but it was clearly over the top and exaggerated. It was blatantly a bit of craic.  &gt;You must be a hit at all the parties if that’s you’re definition of funny.  And you must be a hit if you canny have any banter without being triggered.     &gt;Also how am I triggered lmao,  Because you're taking a daft post on **reddit** so seriously. It's the Internet. Nobody is serious here. It's all just banter between fans. Nobody takes it serious. Well, clearly some of you do 😅🙈  If I said ""I hope Chris Paul slips and accidentally bites his own cock off, which sickens him so much he spews it back up into his sons mouth like a mother bird feeding its baby"" are you honestly saying you think this is serious? Have you never watched George Carlin or Dave Chappelle? Have you never seen South Park? Rick and morty? Never had conversations like this with your mates?   Its _obviously_ exaggerated for comedic effect."
"Luka would be somewhere chilling not playing defense, Chris Paul will get on whoever on the perimeter atleast"
"People have been calling Foster corrupt since Chris Paul was on the Clippers, and not for any reason that has to do with CP3 either."
"That’s not true. The qualifications are playoff games and games specifically Chris Paul played in, including with former teams. I don’t even know if that stat is true but I doubt it’s anything more than a coincidence. Chris Paul has countless possible combinations with various refs, and it’s not all that unlikely that by chance he has a losing streak with one of them."
You know the NBA has a history of refs fixing games? And you know about the history of Scott Foster and Chris Paul right? Refs play way too big of a part in NBA games but go off
Chris Paul
Scott Foster tends to ref big playoff games. Chris Paul tends to lose big playoff games. Doesn’t seem like any big mystery to me
"Alrigh, so the Chris Paul Scott Foster losing streak vs the sweet sweet cash the NBA can make from a game 7...  IDKz I think the latter might Triumph."
Find a way to both make the Suns win and Chris Paul lose.
"&gt;also Chris Paul has publicly stated that he loses games that Scott Foster refs, so it’s out there publicly. *Scott probably didn’t like that* lol  So in response Fosters decided to prove him right?"
"The court is covered with a celebrating crowd and confetti. Chris Paul is just looking for a way off it, the swarm around him growing. He starts to push through the labyrinth around him to no avail. He calls out for his teammates. No response.  Panic starts to set in. He can’t breathe. His head spins around looking for a way out. They meet a set of eyes gazing at him through the crowd. Those are Scott Foster’s eyes. He already knew it.  Turning away, he begins pushing harder. As he feels a hand grab his jersey he instinctively flails and cries out. The hand is gone. Was it ever really there? Can’t look back, must keep pushing.  The crowd is growing louder now. Each push forward comes with another elbow, another stepped on foot. The calls aren’t coming. Pushing, pushing, he finally finds a clearing and catches his breath.  The piercing sound is deafening. Not even the crowd cheering at it’s loudest can drown it out. Chris looks down and notices for the first time that he’s holding a basketball. Next, that his foot is on the line. The sound grows louder. It’s getting closer. He knows where he is. He’s out of bounds. He can’t turn to face him…  Bucks by 10."
Chris Paul has filed a formal complaint already
Chris Paul panic
"I wouldn’t be surprised if the real answer is because Chris Paul has been president of the NBPA since 2013, and it’s likely he’s pushed for new policies that are against the interests of Foster."
This is a joke.   The Lakers did not win a single game in that series when Chris Paul was healthy enough to actually play in the Second half of a game.   The Nuggets aren't going from a sweep to a series win because of Jamal Murray  Maybe the Clippers win with Kawhi but it's still probably a good series.
"They're not making a narrative, Chris Paul said it himself.  He just said it a few games ago ""I'm not a betting man, but 0-11""."
"Just google ""Scott Foster and Chris Paul""   CP3 blasted him last year after the playoffs."
Scott Foster definitely has it out for Chris Paul but he didn't cause their loss last time.
What are the chances Suns retain all these players. What are the chances they retain Chris Paul. Lebron might get Chris to sign with the Lakers to go after another ring.
"This might be an unpopular opinion but isn’t it kind of crazy how clearly referees influence the game in an unfair way and how we as fans just accept it as part of the game.  Like the Donaghy-Foster relationship is almost PROOF that SF has been involved in game manipulation at some level, and the clear bias he shows in games is ridiculous and makes the product objectively worse. I’m not even saying this as a CP fan bc I think the Bucks deserve to win this series so far, but it seems insane for the league to even allow Foster to ref anymore games with Chris Paul when there is clearly a relationship there that affects the product as a whole."
I don't understand all of the complaints about flip flopping. there are 4 million subscribers to r/nba. do you really think people are changing their opinions or that the bucks fans are more vocal after a bucks win and the suns fans are more vocal after a suns win? No one is actually changing how they feel about Chris Paul.
RIP Chris Paul
"Chris Paul stock got too low, he’ll finally break his “curse” against Foster and set up for and EPIC game 7!   I can already see it so clearly lmao."
"Real talk, if Scott foster throws the game for Chris Paul does it undo years of spite?"
while i agree with the basis of your statement that’s not what’s happening here. random age stats are pointless but chris paul being the only player with this many series losses after being up 2-0 isn’t the same.
Chris Paul is about to have one of the biggest grudges a player can have against a ref. Losing 11+ consecutive games for it to climax as an NBA finals loss.
Chris Paul is screwed
"Take my upvote my good sir.   I can't stand Chris Paul. I thought I wanted him to win one but the way he goes about the game is just embarrassing. He's a child flapping his arms and crying most of the game. I think I remember Boogie yelling at him at the end of the Clips series ""You wonder why nobody fuck wit you.""   He was gloating as if they just won the Championship in the Conference Finals. I can't wait to see him cry later on tonight when he realizes he'll never be this close again."
Exactly. Chris Paul went from beat PG of the past decade and Devin Booker went from Kobe Bryant 2.0 to now they ain't making a finals ever again.
Chris Paul getting a year older should help.
"No, but Chris Paul has not won a lot of games he’s reffed. Dude calls a pretty good game but is notorious for not falling for stars flopping (a relatively large part of CP3’s game, historically), which obviously has a negative effect on Chris Paul’s scoring output."
"Yep, imagine the blowback they would get if it came out they purposely took off Foster because of Chris Paul.  It would look just as rigged going through other way."
The nba hates Chris Paul.
If the Sun's win then he rigged it to extend the series. If the Bucks win he rigged it due to his blood feud with Chris Paul.
Chris Paul played with James Harden...
There's a secret pact that Chris Paul has to be traded every year right? Whoever gets him next.
"Bucks in six, cause Chris Paul is regressing fast. I think 4+ turnovers and Booker gets frustrated with him"
Chris Paul is fucked
"If Chris Paul runs into a bucks player in this same exact fashion, people would be up in arms on this sub.  They'd be saying this is why we hate Chris Paul because he makes these dirty plays that don't belong in the game.  This is a dangerous play.  Look at how giannis follows through with his elbow, there is intent to do exactly what he did here which is bull Crowder over.  Neither one of them has the ball, they both have right to that space and Crowder is stepping up to play defense on the ball whereas giannis is just intentionally preventing Crowder from being able to play defense.  Bonus points for it being Scott Foster who called the foul."
"I think if Chris Paul loses this series, he’s even more overrated than Stockton.  Been watching basketball for 35 years.  Stockton got to 2 Finals.    I know the bandwagon flipped towards CP3 this season, but please.  He will go down as just another guy who never won it all."
I think it also was the dirty play by Chris Paul at the end that reminded people of his reputation and made them turn on the idea of a Suns title.
He IS Anti-Chris Paul. But he is Pro Game 7. So see you in Phoenix. Unless the windows smashes and you hear Tony Brothers music start playing.
"Yeah but Stockton IS massively overrated. Never the best player on his team, never an MVP candidate, inflated assist numbers from a PnR heavy offense with easy passes, terrible playoff performances, and never was expected to be the LEADER of a TEAM.   And people expect me to have him as a top 5 PG of all time? How are his performances and accolades better than Magic, Curry, Oscar, West, Nash, Zeke, Chris Paul, etc.   He's nowhere near a top 5 PG or a top 30 player. So the disrespect is warranted.   When has an NBA media account posted John Stockton highlights recently? If he's the all time assists leader surely people say he's the best passer ever and we would be watching his highlights to this day right?? It's because like half of those 16000 passes are just handing the ball to one of the best scorers of all time."
imagine Prime Chris Paul with Karl Malone.  geezus
Chris Paul or hot take: lebron james
"Chris Paul is in my opinion the best player to never when neither a ring or an MVP, and if he does win a ring this year I think there’s an argument to be made that he’s the best player to never win an MVP over over D. Wade."
&gt;What do you think Chris Paul is thinking right now?  Mark Schwarz? Is this you bro?
Chris Paul
Well it definitely helped the lakers that Chris Paul was playing one armed for the first 5 games
So like Chris Paul when Giannis dunked on him
They were able to give DeMarcus a technical foul after the game. They should do the same to Chris Paul
"There is a Chris Paul sized difference between his 1st and 2nd year in OKC, which is the only year where he scored the ball efficiently"
"Over the past 10 years, I would take Harden over Durant.  Harden struggles maintaining efficiency in the playoffs, primarily because he can't be lead ball handler every possession without taking major liberties on defense or sloppy offense.  That being said, if he could have gotten along with Chris Paul, I do believe 2019 or 2020 would have seen them win a title.  In 2018, that Rockets team should have won it all game 6 was referee'd appropriately and / or Paul didn't go down.    Durant's shot is defense and scheme independent - that is to say, nobody can stop him from taking 15 foot jump shots.  He however has struggled increasing the volume of his scoring attempts and being truly heliocentric force.  Moreover, his all-time efficiency from mid-range still pales in comparison to an average player getting a contested layup.  His playmaking finally is average, not great, not mediocre.   It is incredibly close.  From a qualitative perspective, Durant is clearly superior, but in terms of impact on winning, I would still take Harden over 10 playoff runs.  I learned nothing from Durant joining the Warriors, what happened was inevitable from the moment he signed."
Chris Paul is beside himself. Driving around downtown Milwaukee begging (thru texts) Foster's family for information on Scott’s whereabouts. Sources say Paul wants to make amends with the overly critical comments made earlier in the playoffs ahead of Game 6 of the NBA finals.
He works against Chris Paul though
"Realize that without Chris Paul, this Suns team was routinely not making the playoffs. And they wouldn’t have made it this season, either. They have good, young players, but CP3 is the straw that stirs the drink. He can eventually be replaced by someone else, but that guy isn’t on their current roster. If he declines or leaves, that’s very bad news for the Suns."
"That's not true though. Next season, guys like Cam Payne, Reggie Jackson, etc. might come back to earth, and guys like Joe Harris and all of the Bucks shooters might remember how to shoot again.  Or Paul George makes his FTs... or reverts back to his playoff/pandemic P days and never plays good enough to get them into a situation where those FTs matter.   Or Chris Paul might have a healed shoulder, or left wrist, or right hand, or whatever is bugging him... or he's a year older and loses just enough of a step to lose effectiveness.  There are so many hypotheticals you can imagine, but none of them matter. Even less so if we start talking about next year as if it would be an indicator for how things could have gone this year (e.g., if the Lakers are able to shore up their terribly constructed roster, or the Nets are able to get more than a dozen games to work on their chemistry... then clearly one would expect next year's team to be better than this year's)"
"Suns I got Chris paul, devin booker, deandre ayton. They're a decent team this season it's my memory that is trash"
A lot of people think of those high volume scorers like Harden as ball hogs and don’t realize most of them are great passers. Harden isn’t on the Chris Paul and Lebron tier but he’s a top 5 passer in the NBA.
"This reply chain is like a cascade of fucking stupid. Nobody is saying assists are the sole criteria for judging passing ability. That’s an embarrassing strawman. Harden is clearly a wonderful passer not just by stats, but to anyone watching him; this was most evident when CP3 was on the team, but is also just evident in general to anyone who isn’t a meme-turd.   You fetishize *ball movement ooooh* when the Rockets purposefully used an iso-heavy gameplan because they were trying to beat the Warriors. And they almost did. This was attested to by [Chris Paul himself](https://youtu.be/4AclDUnZ6yE)."
These people are ridiculous as if he didn't have a 20/10 season before. Good God these people never saw harden before they got Chris Paul.
Westbrook is averaging more assists this season (11.3) than Chris Paul. I guess he's a better playmaker and passer?
Nah but fr Lebron is 36 and Chris Paul is 35
Ain’t Lebron older than Chris Paul😂
Chris Paul?
Chris Paul is better imo
I dont know shit about volleyball but I feel very confident Chris Paul would be good at it. he seems like the type that could play any sport
Chris paul made him look so good
"It wasn’t a better opportunity then 2018 lol. We were the 4th seed and won 15 less games that season compared to first. Chris Paul was way worse and we lost ariza. We were up 3-2 and one win away from an easy finals against the cavs, 2019 we deserved to lose, we were already down 2-3 even if we won we weren’t guranteed to beat the raps like against the cavs. 2018 was ours man"
Chris Paul gonna sue
#COURT VISION SIMILAR TO CHRIS PAUL
Rodger- kd   Brady- lebron   Watson-Beal   Mahomes-curry   Allen-embiid  Tannehill-  butler  Wilson- kawhi  Carr- Tatum   Brees- Chris Paul   Ryan- pg13  Murray- AD  Stafford- jokic Mayfield- Dame  Jackson- giannis   Herbert- luka
"Chris Paul is extremely respected by virtually everyone. Im sure even people who dislike him on the court, enjoy having him as president."
"Harden, who couldn't even make it work with CHRIS PAUL?"
"Yeah, you guys lucked out. Chris Paul didn’t play. You lose if he does"
"The sheer number of talented, productive guards in the West right now is insane. Understanding that SGA is the clear alpha on a team tanking (well, supposed to be tanking LOL), you have production lines that are right up there with the guys most would have penciled in to be All Stars at the start of the season.   Unless I missed a change to All Star lineups, at MOST the West can name 6 backcourt players to the roster. It's going to be a travesty that a minimum of THREE of these guys are going to be snubbed this year:  Steph Curry Damian Lillard Luka Doncic Devin Booker Chris Paul Donovan Mitchell Shai Gilgeous-Alexander CJ McCollum Mike Conley"
"They had iso with very specific personnel and a well built switch system, as well as a much more cohesive defensive identity (Chris Paul, Clint Capela, Tucker). Nets have a more Frankenstein-ish focus on iso, with less defense"
Hard to say when one duo had Chris Paul and the other had Reggie Jackson.
"HARDEN DID NOT FORCE THE WESTBROOK TRADE.  r/NBA needs to stop saying this. [Tilman Fertitta literally gave an interview where he said the front office said no, so he forced them to do it](https://rocketswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/02/rockets-owner-tilman-fertitta-tells-final-hours-of-paul-westbrook-deal/). He also had reportedly said [he though CP3’s contract was the worst he’s ever seen](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/rockets-owner-tilman-fertitta-thought-chris-paul-had-the-worst-contract-hed-ever-seen-per-report/).  The CP3 trade was about money. Westbrook’s contract wasn’t as long and he was younger, so Tilman forced it to happen."
Theo Maledon is a poor mans Chris Paul   Poku is a poor man
"Chris Paul ruined OKC's losing culture, smdh"
"Chris Paul didn't lead them to shit, what are you talking about? He literally averaged 20p less than Harden in the 2018 season on worse efficiency. He was a decent player on a team built around on a unique offensive superstar, he wasn't the leader, probably not even the second most important player on those teams.    The last season with Houston he averaged 15,6p and 8,2 assists per game, which is fine but not exactly a superstar player.    There was a reason why they had to give up picks to trade him for Russel Westbrook of all people.    This year he is averaging 13 points and 8 assists, on really bad efficiency for the the suns in 31 minutes, so saying he is ""revitalizing"" them is a different kind of stupid.   The reason Pelicans had no first round picks were because they traded them all in win now trades to make AD happy."

I'm talking about him completely *checking out*. Not the same thing. Kobe was awful in his inefficiency but he would leave it all on the floor. He played from tip to buzzer. Harden didn't do that. You can't blame Tillman for that. We had Vince Carter, he totally checked out &amp; forced his way out of Toronto. The moment he got to the Nets, he went back to being a monster on the court. His *on-court* behaviour is why so many Raps fans are against him &amp; against the idea of him retiring a Raptor (which isn't an issue now) or him getting a statue. *Vince Carter gave up on the team* ***on the court***. That's the biggest sin. Just look all that Lebron has done &amp; you'll still hear about how he checked out in the playoffs during his last run with the Cavs before he jumped ship to Miami. That shit will stick to him forever.  If you're upset with management or ownership or whatever, fine, but you don't sabotage the team by just giving up.  &gt;""over the past five years Harden has shot less than 25 percent from the 3-point line in playoff fourth quarters and overtimes.""  [He didn't even take a shot in the 4th quarter](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/james-hardens-disappearing-act-in-another-playoff-fourth-quarter-is-so-on-brand-its-painful-to-watch/) last season.

What you didn’t say was that Kobe said this when Capela and Chris Paul was out. His team had no chance to win unless he dropped forty. Why are you mentioning that like he’s not playing with KD and Kyrie? No matter how you slice it a James Harden lead team was the only real competition GSW faced.
Id like to introduce to you one Chris Paul
"Anyone as in anyone other than Draymond or Chris Paul?  LeBron, Paul, Dray, that's some pretty good company"
Ancient Chris Paul? He got a Chris Paul that led the Rockets to being a 67 win team fresh off leading the Clippers to 50 win seasons. That same Chris Paul brought OKC to the playoffs last year and is revitalizing Phoenix this year.  Not to mention prime Dwight.  The Pelicans had no first round picks between AD and Buddy. They completely ignored improving that roster and every key piece on the team got there early and didn't improve. Jrue is the only other player worth mentioning he played with his whole career. Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson were his #3 and #4 guys (with Tyreke Evans #2) for a while and they were Harden's depth guys on some of the weaker rosters he was on.
"&gt;a low usage player is scoring less than high usage players  shocking development, really.   other players with less than 0.2 points per touch who also rank high on touches per game: Chris Paul, Lonzo Ball, Marcus Smart, LaMelo Ball.   i wonder if there's a pattern emerging here."
"That’s not true at all, Chris Paul was mad Daryl told him he won’t trade him and he got traded. Truth is Daryl had no plans to trade em and was also leaning on harden to stick with Paul. Paul is an aggravating personality with everyone and I don’t mean that in a bad way, he’s a competitor like kobe and he doesn’t mind the conflict he just hoops and wins. Harden is just naturally an introvert but you know what makes hoops work, the cohesive.  So that’s why even more ariza was valuable. He was the championship vet harden and Paul both respected and looked up to. Played with kobe not to mention their best stretch defender in the year they had the best defense. I’ts an underrated domino sort of like heat. Why do they pay haslem who doesn’t play, culture.  Truth is most of hardens teammates love him, what people don’t know is how engaged he is in leading in the huddle took you don’t do what he had done wi th out a killer mentality and a sustained consistent focus to being great. Nba is too athletic and talented to do that on accident and we’re talking four seasons straight.  I’ll let Chris Paul tell it himself :  “People don’t realize, that’s the biggest thing that we missed. That was tough when we lost [Ariza] because he sorta was like the glue. He was that glue for our team.”  I agree harden has struggles in the playoffs and that’s our roster build. He’s fine with moving the ball but you have to realize you need depth. Why would he only want to play iso and then Goto the nets? Bc they played that way bc it was their best bet and most efficient bc Tillman would not give them the roster he wanted. Tillman not only did not run it back, he cut rotation players yearly so it’s just hogwash too say Tillman got him who he wanted. And with that small roster who plays in playoff then hardens style is aingicantly less effective bc the whole game plan is for him and we don’t have other creators. When we had Paul we were one game from the finals against a historic team, and by all accounts s harden would’ve run back with Chris Paul bc he trusted morey to add talent and depth. And that’s what they needed depthS when harden was off the floor the offense went dead. It’s ahsame the narrative is harden is terrible. Go check kobe had littered all sorts of inefficient games when along the way to a title. It happens but overall not many I. History can do what he does and it ain’t because he’s more a th legit it’s because he puts in the work every day. Yes even in Vegas after strippers, harden was notorious to show up at 3 am and workout with his friends .  The truth is morey gave us assets to keep building on that team, Tillman pushed him to spend the next few seasons cutting quality and margins on this team and a championship organization doesn’t act like that. Like you said raptors had some great development they also took a swing on an olde Marc gasol for 50 million. Tillman would never do that, Masai is incredible man and I love watching the raptors. I hope they get rolling this year. But imagine if ownership said now you gotta save, gone is of iog for some valuable role player.  And Daryl is the one who bought nurse to rockets dlwague by the way. What an incredible coach,"
"Yeah sure he has great mechanics, but he’s too short to have the overall vision of Bron and Jokic. They can simply make plays that Chris Paul cannot based only on height.   There are some skip passes that you see where LBJ slings it at hyper sonic speed, over a defender, and right into the shooter’s pocket. Chris Paul has 0% chance of even seeing those. So his mechanics and fundamentals might be regarded as “better” by a basketball textbook, but just the fact that there are things he physically cannot do, he can’t be number one."
I remember there was a rumor that Shannon Brown slept with Pau Gasols girlfriend after they got swept by Dallas. Brown got traded to Phoenix that offseason &amp; the Lakers were trying to to acquire both Dwight Howard &amp; Chris Paul to form their big 3 but CP3 deal was vetoed. Dwight was next.
someone would just post an erotic nba fanfiction copypasta and the network would quickly switch to some Chris Paul state farm ads
Chris Paul annoys me
"the poor form is worse, go back to 2019. He for some reason goes and volunteers to be the press about MDA negotiation and tells them that MDA doesn't know how long he wants to coach(totally fabricated and MDA considerd invovling lawyers bc hes lowering MDA market)   And he doubled the offer which in reality was half of hwat he told the press.    This guy does it all the time. We all know Chris paul is a notoriously competitve team, then after they lost in 2019 tillman again went to th press to say rockets should've had a step on your throat killer mentality which he was the one to instill.     Let laone its a bit odd that they say harden pushd teh trad when like above, tillman went on collin cowherd bragging about he was on a yacht in europe at 2 am and his basketball ops team was weak and he said get it done.  Morey was on interview saying Harden wanted Russ, but when morey said it wasnt likely he was fine to build upon that team  Tillman also took the buffer in between harden and paul, sort of how heat pay haslem to just be the glue chemistry culture guy. That was Ariza, they both repcted him, he won rings with kobe where harden grew up. He was a perect 3/d long glue guy for them on their defensive scheme, but just like he did with MDA he chased out our Associate head coach which was the last time we had close to a top5 defense and almost went o the finals  So people know the big names they dont see the little dominos that tillman did just to water down the culture of the franchise and make james harden dream/job harder while publicly telling him to pick up his bootstraps and g et better results with a worse product in a league that has the top level tams really gooing for it.  side note, they replaced Ariza with james ennis. He was traded that  vry season while in rotation for a 2nd round swap.  Also dropped another 1st round pick again in some trade gymnsatics to get under the tax.   I suspect that was it for morey. he had built a team in 2018  that came one game from the finals, had all their players bird rights to rerun, had 10 million plus in trade exceptios, mid level, and several picks...most of those things were just ignored and morey spent the last two seasons signing minimum players and trading to get under the tax even if the player.  So harden is suppoesed to spend his last 1-3 years of the culmination of his work with a guy whho publicly lies to him, cut cost, makes his job worse, hurts the cutlure and then publicly leaks trashings of you when you sit hre and play camong the highest minutes, games, and useage in a time of load management.    You don't lead the league in assist, points and have numbers taht are rarified air EVEN for a hall of famer and do that for the marathon of a seaoson for 4-5 stragith years. Robertson from OKC made 10 million plus just being known as a harden stopper, guys come at him every night  You don't do that accidentally or if you're not committed. That takes mental resilience like crazy and he has excuses to ret and doesn't. Hes a hoop junkie, but he isnt media savvy what so ever and tillman can buy up espn  in fact go look at Windhorst rcent podcast when he critisized tillman and said he knows anytime he says something about him he gets a call.    But people will keep buying this dudes snake oil sadly"
So Chris Paul isn’t an insurance salesman???

"&gt;But instead of answering, you dodge the whole thought experiment.   The problem is that your ""thought experiment"" was the actual dodge. The argument was about showing up. Because you are trying to trap me into your comically narrow logic I will now answer the question to continue your ""thought experiment."" Yes. Chris Paul is better than Kyle Lowry.   Maybe the problem is here that we have different definitions of ""showing up."" To me showing up means playing to your ability. At work today I would say I didn't completely show up because I found out my friend died yesterday. I was at work but my mind wasn't.  I explained this before but when I say James Harden doesn't show up in the playoffs, I'm saying the edge he bring into the regular season is not there.   I pulled a stat specific to this conversation. It's a little random but bare with me. I tracked a bunch of stars that won championships to see how many playoff games they played where they shot less than 25% field goal percentage to show you an example of how much more frequently James Harden has a bad game in the playoffs. In no way am I saying this is a perfect stat but one factor in winning is obviously consistency.   I will list them ranked from least consistent to most consistent and you can tell me if it's a good indicator of greatness in any way.  Kawhi Leonard 3 times in 124 Magic Johnson 4 times in 190 Lebron James 3 times in 260  Larry Bird 2 times in 164 Michael Jordan 1 time in 179  At this time you are probably saying to yourself that these are all mid range shooters. Lets look at some 3 point shooters.  Kyrie Irving 5 times in 61 Damien Lillard 3 times in 55 Klay Thompson 6 times in 123 Steph Curry 4 times in 112  Kevin Durant 3 times in 139  There were definitely a bunch of players that were more inconsistent than Harden but I am only putting exceptional players because Harden gets regular season awards for being exceptional.  The amount of times Harden has shot less than 25% fg%: 14 times in 128 games. That's a lot more.  You want me to go into true shooting percentage and how great an indicator that is? He is below all the active players I listed that won a title as well.   He simply isn't a great playoff player and it takes being great to win.  You pointing out a couple specific games is completely missing the point. I never said he has never played well in the playoffs."
You really think any other GM could've done a better job against the KD Warriors without Chris Paul? What kind of move do you think would have improved upon what he did?
It really was a sinking ship as soon as Chris Paul blew out his hammy and they lost to the warriors. He was only going to get older and worse. Then they traded all their picks for Westbrook who was a worse fit and has also been getting older and worse
Harden was 11/25 and 6/15 from 3 in the only elimination game in 2019. Chris Paul was shooting 39% from the field and 28% from 3 before that. He only had 1 good game the whole playoffs
"Shaq straight up ripped into him on TNT. Called out Harden’s stats in playoff elimination games. Brought up how Harden asked for Howard, Chris Paul, Westbrook, and now Wall and couldn’t make it work with any of them.  I hope his luck changes in Brooklyn."
"The question I asked was ""Is Kyle Lowry better than Chris Paul?"" as a retort to your nooby rings argument. But instead of answering, you dodge the whole thought experiment. You even only quoted the word ""Kyle Lowry"" in your response LOL. You expect someone to sift through that 10th-grade essay when you won't even answer the original question? Good luck with that.  You don't need a word salad of this magnitude to say that James' stats are lower in the playoffs than in the regular season. What I'm trying to help you understand is that even with his lower play-off numbers he still absolutely shows up. Casuals like you are what ruins this sub. You try to use blog-boy analytics while devolving arguments into ""Rings"" or ""Mamba-Mentality"" like you already got roasted for.  You can quote any stats you want but there is a reason why the greatest basketball minds don't spew the nonsense you are trying to push. Here is some context for you. The KD Warriors went 32-6 in the 2017 and 2018 playoffs. 4-3 against Houston, 28-3 against everyone else. So if Harden didn't “show-up” what did Dame, Bron, AD and everyone else who got swept or a gentleman’s sweep have? People say Harden disappears in “key games,” but they just define “key games” as any game Harden plays poorly in. For example, Harden was on the bench during the 2015 game 6 comeback against the Clippers, but he had 26 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists in Game 5, also an **elimination game**. And 31 points, 7 rebounds, and 8 assists in Game 7 to complete the **3-1 comeback**. He also dropped 41 pts, 9 rebounds, 6 assists in 2019 Game 3 against GS to avoid going down 3-0. Had 38, 10, and 4 in Game 4 to tie it up at 2-2. Games 5 and 6 of that series, he put up good numbers too.  You are full of fallacies and the one you are spewing right now is a slippery slope. Just because someone's stats are lower in the playoffs doesn't automatically mean they don't ""show-up""."
"SAS waiving DeRozan Aldridge and Mills does not make sense.  Chris Paul can tear his Achilles and the suns won’t waive him.   Players of these caliber don’t get bought out, they get traded if their teams don’t want them. The best player on this market will likely be Trevor Ariza."
"You spelled Dwyane Wade wrong...  He's ahead of Chris Paul, KD, and Harden on that list."
"You're leaving out an important part of context. People only say that as a rebuttal to the argument ""Harden couldn't win, even with Chris Paul"". People are just saying that he probably could have, and would have, won the title, but we'll never know. I agree it's definitely not a given to say he would be Lebron, I mean it's Lebron, but you can't just say the injury doesn't matter."
"&gt;The Rockets being a hamstring away is, because the possibility of it going a different way exists. The possibility of the Cavaliers winning that game in regulation ceases to exist when JR’s mistake is factored in.  “If Chris Paul had a healthy hamstring the rockets win the series” is the narrative OP is trying to dispel. The reason why saying JR’s blunder cost them the game when there was no clear shot available (LeBron was 40+ feet out at the time) doesn’t make sense is because it wasn’t the worst outcome available. Losing in regulation via turnover or bricked early shot is still very possible. Him running the clock out was dumb, but in terms of actual consequences, it was inconsequential. George Hill missing that free throw cost them the game more than JR did."
good on Chris Paul to always disappoint and get injured at the exact moment when the potential disappointment is at its highest.
"I hate how something can happen in the moment and it is clear to everyone what the case is, but then years later some dude just decides ""no"" and feels totally justified to revise history.   Iguodala was utterly terrible that season and not nearly as valuable to the Warriors as Mbah Ah Moute to the Rockets, let alone Chris Paul.   It was almost unanimously understood that if the Rockets beat the Warriors, they would destroy the Cavs. Fucking Harden and CP3 doing a PnR switch to abuse those terrible Cavs bigs, it would be a slaughter. Everyone knew and everyone agreed.   The Cavs got absolutely molested by the Warriors and would have been the same against the Rockets who had the most wins that year.   Every. Single. Person. Agreed.   But now you get to show up years later and say ""but ackshually, no. Lebron would beat them cause Lebron""."
"Harden got an ancient Chris Paul, and the guy who was universally considered the worst contract in the league before the trade in Russel Westbrook, lets not pretend like he got a top 10 player.   The Pelicans won 48 games the year before AD decided to bail, they were a playoff team, they did everything they could to attract a star."
"&gt;Talk to me when he has a ring.  I hope you know that all you do when you say this is flag yourself as a casual, which you clearly are. Any serious basketball analysis, analysts, or discourse always proves the rings argument when used the way you tried to use it as being illogical or a fallacy. Casuals like you use it to either move the goalposts or as a strawman. Quick question, do you think Kyle Lowry is better than Chris Paul because he has a ring? Hopefully not. Rings don't just make you better than another player and are 9/10 times brought up when casuals like you lose debates as you did earlier.  &gt;He has never lead the ppg I'm the playoffs despite winning 3 consecutive scoring titles.  Again moving the goal-posts. Now to ""show-up"" in the playoffs, you have to lead the league in playoff PPG? Lol, stop."
"This is due to the fact , a lot of Houston already wanted harden gone anyways since the chris Paul debacle lol rockets chats were full of anti-harden fans tbh and he wasn’t nearly as beloved to fans as lebron was to the cavs"
He also said that the Chris Paul contract was the worst he'd seen in sports and business lol  You can just see it in the thread of Shaq criticizing Harden by wrongly claiming the Rockets did literally everything Harden wanted. People hate Harden and refuse to see any other context
"Chris Paul and Harden is pretty damn close lol, but maybe Clippers All Defensive CP would’ve been better"
"Never said it eliminated multicollinearity. And RAPM and RPM are just slight improvements to APM. Apart from minor corrections the stats are almost identical. And Steph, KD, Klay and Dray didn't have absurdly high values of RPM or APM during the dynasty years, only Steph did http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/year/2017. The other guys were high but weren't close to Steph, which is fair considering they were all decent players especially KD. In fact Steph hasn't not led the stat during a healthy year since 2013 where he came second and Chris Paul came first. He's clearly doing something right that can't be measured by just counting points scored, assists, blocks, boards and steals.     APM and it's related stats are the least lineup dependent stats available, regular box scores don't account for the quality of your team-mates, APM does. They're still line-up dependent to a degree but negligibly in comparison to other stats."
"Hello, this is Blake Griffin, Chris Paul is trying to get in the locker room!"
"Yeah [the TS% splits are also interesting](https://www.pbpstats.com/on-off/nba/player?Season=2020-21,2014-15,2012-13,2013-14,2016-17,2015-16,2018-19,2017-18,2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;TeamId=1610612745&amp;PlayerId=201935) one thing I saw just now is many of his recent teammates like Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Eric Gordon, PJ Tucker actually had higher TS% when he wasnt on the court"
Chris Paul tryna get in here to kick my ass!
"He asked for Chris Paul, they traded for him. Westbrook his buddy, traded for him. Shooters, traded for him. I’ve been following him for a long time buddy."
"I the only thing that would stop them would be the age difference. Chris Paul is 35, Kyrie is 28.   Book and Kyrie in Phoenix tho👀👀"
"“I’m 6’10, 255, one of the most powerful players in the NBA. Chris Paul tryna get in here and kick my ass. Get down here quick!”"

"Hey this is Blake Griffin, Chris Paul tryna get in the locker room. Get down here save me!"
I like [this one](https://sportige.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Chris-Paul-Sneaking-e1516133601266.jpg)
"&gt; No offense, but James Harden joining Tillman in pushing CP3 out also didnt help things at all.  Chris Paul warranting that didn't help either.  Harden had no problem playing with CP3 when they (and Chris) were a great team.  The problems suddenly came up when CP3 had one of the worst years of his career and couldn't stay healthy...again."
"I usually end up bringing up this exact point anytime there's a discussion around Harden.  He was given everything he wanted and he fell short, which he acknowledges, but if Paul's hamstring doesn't go out in Game 5, I'm still convinced that Rockets team would've won Game 6 or 7 (which required a [statistically improbable night of terrible shooting in missing 27 straight threes](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/odds-rockets-missing-27-straight-3-pointers-vs-warriors-was-insane) to lose) to close out the series against the Warriors. And if we beat them, considering how the Warriors handled the Cavs in the Finals, I can only assume it would've been the same for the Rockets.  And that distinctly changes the narrative around not only Harden, but also around Chris Paul and Mike D'Antoni with a championship on their resumes."
"Funny how you pop in the scoreline for that second series like you're hoping no one notices. You see, the series I remember had Harden shooting 24% from three and scoring a quarter of his total points in the series from the foul line. It also featured Chris Paul carrying his ass in 2 of their three wins while Harden tried to shoot them out of the game.  I'm not saying Harden is bad. Harden is one of the best players of the era, but he's not Shaq. Shaq not only had a dozen playoff series more impressive than any of Harden's but what was arguably the worst playoff series he ever had (2006 vs the Bulls) wouldn't be Harden's worst even if you only compared it to his time in Houston and discount ones against the Warriors.  Shaq is on a different level to Harden come postseason, and when you compare greats postseason matters."
"Probably not but the mental image of Blake Griffin calling the cops because of being scared of Chris Paul is hilarious. This, the steam room story, and the churros are the three best Inside the NBA moments (honorary mention to Chuck trashing the Suns)."
I mean kawhi with the Spurs for a couple years was better than Chris Paul was at any point this decade
"538 now has RAPTOR ratings for seasons going back to 2013-14.   If you sort by offense only, the top 8 seasons are in order:   Stephen Curry, James Harden, Stephen Curry, James Harden, Stephen Curry, Chris Paul, James Harden, Stephen Curry.   KD has played with each of the 2 best offensive players of the last 5 years. Add in the fact that he played with Westbrook before that, and you realize that KD has literally never not played with a HoF PG."
Is Chris Paul even an asshole? He seems kind of petty at times but I feel like he's usually pretty cool
We are okc. Wall is our chris Paul.
chris paul led a wing player insurrection on the clippers locker room
And the answer was Westbrook? He gave up on both and Chris Paul was much better in 2020.
"&gt; Harden who has had much better rosters than you're giving him credit for  He really hasn't though? The best player he ever played with was Chris Paul in 17/18 and that team nearly won the championship and was the 2nd best team in the league, the problem was the best team in the league happened to be arguably the greatest team of all-time in the KD Warriors with FOUR All-Stars.   He then played with a thoroughly reduced CP3 in 2019, and Westbrook who was a shell of himself in 2020.   Before the CP3 trade, he was the lone star on his team.   &gt; He did still come back from 3-1 against the same GS team  LeBron + Kyrie &gt; Steph + Klay, why that is seen as such a triumph for LeBron is beyond me.   &gt; made it to the Finals  In the crap-tastic Eastern Conference. The 2018 Rockets would've made the Finals if they were in the East, they were the 2nd best team in the league, the only team that ever threatened the KD Warriors."
Chris Paul would beat someone up. So would rondo tbh
"~~Chris paul and~~ Westbrook so twice  But both of them ended up disappearing in different ways during the playoffs  Edit: Actually jk, Chris Paul wasn't even an all star in 2018, madness"
Not showing up to practice? Clubbing during a pandemic? Throwing his teammates under a bus? Getting Chris Paul moved?
"He is very shy and reserved in person. He loves kids. At the season ticket holder events...when he went which was not every year. He would spend much more time with kids on the floor than adults.  When you caught him off guard...not at something scheduled...he was very friendly and outgoing. You could tell he felt uncomfortable at scheduled events with fans expecting some time around him.  Westbrook, Chris Paul, and Dwight Howard were the opposite when they were here. I felt like Westbrook would have been offended had I not high fives him hard and with a full hand. Harden high fives fans like a dead fish or even bumped his wrist in place of a hand. I got the feeling sometimes like maybe he is a germaphobe at least around fans?"
"He didnt single handily do anything. How are people going to say the NBA is a team sport in one breath to excuse Harden's failures and then try to give him sole credit in another.  Chris Paul was huge to that team as was their ability to switch actions with CP3, Ariza, PJ Tucker, and Harden. It's not like Harden was the primary defender of Steph and KD"
This is when Chris Paul was on the Rockets and he felt disrespected in his return game to the Staples Center against the Clippers so after the game he left the Visitors locker room to confront the Clippers players about the game.
"""Single handedly"" Lol ever heard of this point guard named chris paul?"
They didn't rely on 3 pointers that heavily until after Chris Paul got injured. Why does nobody mention this lol
"As a peak, yeah, I think that's fair.  Although I wouldn't argue against Chris Paul based on contribution over the entire decade."
"""I am 6'10 220 lbs and one of the most powerful players in the NBA but Chris Paul is trying to get in and kick my ass! Get here quick!"" Legendary lol"
"Yes and no. The rockets got Harden Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook. The Pelicans didn’t seem like they were willing to spend. I mean they don’t even have their own medical staff"
Well....Chuck did make fun of:  \- Jamaal the Cashier  \- the female population of San Antonio  \- Blake Griffin requesting police presence cause Chris Paul wanted to beat him up
"So it's just a coincidence that luka is first all nba point guard over chris Paul and Westbrook, huh isnt that weird.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team   Notice how I linked a source of legitimate information and not some tweet"
"&gt; I never said Chris Paul was amazing   Lol I did, and then you replied to it, which was the entire scope of this convo. My point is that it doesn’t “count” for Westbrook but somehow “counts” for cp"
Was harden supposed to know Chris Paul would play like a role player in 2019?
I could agree with you if Harden didn't want to bring in Chris Paul and Westbrook and decided they weren't good enough and did not vouch for Silas. Houston wasn't good enough but Harden was one of the biggest culprits behind it.
"Hello police, Chris paul trying to beat me up"
That'd be multiple universes away cuz Chris Paul is as durable as a paper bag in a hurricane.
"What did you do, exactly? I never said Chris Paul was amazing and tried to back it up with anything to do with Harden lol"
Chris Paul
"There are still a lot of questions about the Nets. On offense, I do wonder whether Kyrie Irving and James Harden can accept fewer touches.  Irving has a history of resenting a secondary role, and here he would be asked to accept a tertiary role.  Harden also left Oklahoma in part because he wanted to be the primary option, and he thrived in that role, but he apparently had trouble sharing the ball with Chris Paul and Westbrook.  Durant is the only one of the three who has proven he can thrive without the ball in his hands all the time.   At least we know all of them *can* be superstars on offense. Will they play defense?  Will they have enough help to play defense?  It's by no means certain that they will dominate the East, let alone the NBA.  As for Houston, when you have an unhappy superstar with inadequate support and decide to rebuild, yes, this is the kind of trade you get.  All things being equal, it's not a fair trade.  But under the circumstances, it was the best trade they could get, and they had to do it.  So I don't blame them at all for taking what they could get and focusing on a rebuild."
"Harden is a Chris Paul hamstring injury away from being remembered totally differently. And Tillman has made Morey make cost cutting moves to duck the tax every season when they could’ve pushed all the chips in.   Harden isn’t without his faults, but to say they gave him everything is a lie."
*Laughs in Harden*  *Chuckles in Kawhi*  *Cackles in Chris Paul*  *Giggles in LeBron*  *Roars in Kyrie*  *Snickers in KD*
Russel Westbrook...  The Chris Paul of his generation.  All that damn talent yet he will never win a championship.
Has Chris Paul ever averaged more assists than RW?
"You're still a clown.  You keep moving the goal posts over and over from your multiple debunked original claims, and now you're being disingenuous as hell:  mentioning Dragic missing most of the season when he never played on the LeBron Heat, making out Wade to be washed up when he was the previous couple seasons with LeBron, massaging win totals, throwing out middling player names as if they're good... and you mention JR and Korver like they were good players in 2019?  LOL.  JFC.    Your cherrypicked, goal-post-moving, disingenuous arguments don't change the fact that every team LeBron joined became significantly better, every team he left sucked, that the Bulls were still pretty good without Rose, and that the Harden Rockets were only elite with Chris Paul.  Try doing some actual research and fucking look at their advanced metrics before and after LeBron (hint: you'll notice they're mostly the same), along with researching into how those ""superteams"" performed when LeBron sat (hint: usually sucked), as well as how the team played when its ""second superstar"" sat but not LeBron (hint: usually just fine).  Or be like a typical LeBron hater and just ignore literally every fact that makes him out to be a great player, IDC, I'm blocking you immediately after this."
"😂😂 help, chris paul is gonna beat me up"
the chris paul jersey tuck game still keeps me awake some nights
"Right? He bitches and moans so much. I say he's right up there with LeBron (yeah, he's awesome, but still complains a lot) and Chris Paul as far as complaining. DeMarcus Cousins also whines, come to think about it. Who else am I missing?"
Lol Chris Paul is teflon on /r/nba nobody blames him for anything what do you mean
Chris Paul in some form of coaching.
I don't think Zion will make the team.  he is a sieve on defense and they need at least one big like Bam or Myles Turner to defend the likes of Jokic and Vucevic.  And they would probably give Trae's spot to one of the older guards that would want to go like Mike Conley or Chris Paul.  Trae and Zion's time would probably come in 2024.
"Now you're simply underplaying Kyrie. Advanced stats and basic stats have painted him as a top 15 player for a while, and your statement that only casuals would agree with is false. What 15 players were clearly better than Kyrie in 2017-2018? Guys like PG, Dame, at that time it was extremely debatable Kyrie Vs Dame. You have to remember how bad Dame choked in the playoffs. Embiid or Jokic weren't really considered a top 10 player yet either, nor Jimmy Butler, or Tatum, guys that are considered top 15 today.   Now obviously there are some players, like Chris Paul, Westbrook, John Wall, who were considered much better then than now, but your just flat out wrong to say that no one would think Kyrie was a top 15 player back in those days."
"He's better than   &gt; Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Chris Paul, Havlicek, Bob Petit, Kawhi Leonard"
Actions have consequences. He just happened to walk into the perfect storm of all of it being caught live and on camera.  Do you think Blake Griffen has depression from when Chuck and Shaq were making fun of Chris Paul trying to fight him?
"Ask Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook and Paul George about the playoffs"
"Is Dwyane Wade better than any of the following players (list not in order)?  Jordan, Kareem, LeBron, Bird, Magic, Duncan, Dirk, Karl Malone, Moses Malone, Shaq, Hakeem, David Robinson, Julius Erving, Wilt, Bill Russell, Charles Barkley, Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Oscar Robinson, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Kevin Garnett, Chris Paul, Havlicek, Bob Pettit, Kawhi.    There are others I'd put ahead too but my point is that he isn't a top 25 player ever imo. For the 2000s he didn't even play the whole decade. He is clearly behind Shaq (who ended decade badly but was amazing for most of it), Dirk, Duncan, Kobe, LeBron, Nash, and Garnett. He is borderline top 10 along with  Dwight and Chris Paul in there too."
My boy Chris Paul turning back the clock!!!0
Chris Paul on the Clippers would have the all-time record
I think so. He's been to as many conference finals as Chris Paul and he's done it as a first option so I think he's good to go.
"I would have been skeptical before last year but watching Chris Paul age changed my mind. Steph and CP3 have very similar skill sets (I’m not saying their play style is even remotely similar. I’m talking about how these are guys with extremely tight handles, good shooting, and passing) and CP3’s bag is aging really well (he’s rough from 3 this season but his midrange has been money and that’s always been his game). If Steph’s fundamental skills age anything like CP3’s have, he’ll be a max player the rest of his career"
"The players that the cameras are on most are going to appear to complain the most. Not only because they get more screen time, but also because they are involved in more plays.  With that said, LeBron, Draymond, and Chris Paul stick out among the rest to me. Paul mainly from his Clipper days.  I've not watched as much lately, but I hear from friends that Luka is bad, too."
"Hardens usage rate has plummeted since he got to Brooklyn. He's at 24.8%, his lowest mark since his last year in OKC. It's only 2% higher than Chris Paul"
"You say that like he had a choice between Paul and Kemba. No shit he would swap the two if given the opportunity today. Kemba was as good of a replacement for Kyrie as we could have hoped for last year until injuries took their toll though.  Absolute revisionist history to say Kemba has been a bad fit, or that Ainge did a poor job signing him. Who should he have tried to bring in instead? Rondo? In a perfect world Hayward would have played more of a Chris Paul type role for us had he stayed healthy."
this just looks like usage rate rankings and chris paul

Except that’s not remotely what “he’s got the skill of Chris Paul” means.
"Griffith has a eFG% of 49 on his career... Chris Paul has an eFG% of 52 so I guess Paul has ""empty stats"" too."
"1 the Western Conference at the guard position isn’t nearly as tough as it was when Dame missed those games. There’s no prime Chris Paul anymore, No Harden, No Westbrook.   25/8 is not missing out lmao. Booker’s, Mitchell’s, Demar’s, or Chris Paul’s numbers aren’t that.   Plus his team is above .500. A 25/8 player who was rookie of the year the year prior, who’s also one of the most popular young players in the league is getting in  I’d argue if he played the full year he would have been the 4th lock behind Steph,Dame and Luka"
"I wouldn't say Luka and Book would have been redundant. There's a reason we went out and got Rubio and then traded for Chris Paul, it's because Book is really limited as the primary playmaker. As a secondary playmaker, he's amazing, but we tried point Book and it was a struggle. Pair Luka's dominance with Book's secondary playmaking and off ball abilities and that would be an incredibly tough team to stop.  That being said, I'm loving what I'm seeing with Ayton and really can't complain when he's playing like this. His defense and rebounding have been consistently excellent this year, and when he brings it offensively the man is a menace"
"Hi LAPD, this is Blake Griffin, Chris Paul about to beat me up!"
I love Chris Paul
"Mate look, I am from Hong Kong and I appreciate that he speaks up. But from the basketball point of view, he did all he can to bring a champ to Houston and after last year playoff it’s clear that the team would need a new direction.  He gambled hard on Chris Paul contract and it didn’t work out great, and it ended up locking the team cap space and leave little room for rebuild or strength possibility. He also went all into his small ball squad and it didn’t work.  Sure he had his good time in Houston and his Moray ball almost succeed, but it’s also crystal clear that Houston need to rebuild and Moray is not quite a guy for that. I just think him moving to Philly is a better outcome for everyone"
Chris Paul
"Lmfao the dantoni card, harden *is* the system, he literally just went iso every play, don’t give me that shit. In game 5 KD wasnt having a good game anyways and we were winning before he went down too. Not sure why those stats shouldn’t count. Harden had better stats when you account for this, and there wasn’t much of a difference on defense considering they guarded eachother.   And you just cherry pick again to make it seem like he played bad.. he wasn’t good in 14 but was great the whole 15 playoffs besides like 1 game, look at his stats he was generally efficient and we went to the WCF while he put up big numbers every step of the way. First 2 games in oracle he dominated but nobody showed up and we lost 2 close games.  In 2016 he averaged 27/7 on 56% TS against the 73-9 warriors, how the hell did he suck lmao it was a miracle he dragged us to the 8th seed. In 2017 we beat the thunder in round 1 while harden dropped 33/7/7 on 60% TS, then even counting for his horrible game 6 he still averages 25/5/10 on 57% TS that series, he wasn’t terrible just because he played one bad game lmao. In 2018 he was inefficient but he missed tons of threes that were fouls and it inflated it even mkre, but we were still up 3-2 until chris Paul went down and we almost certainly beat them. In 2019 against the jazz they sold out to stop him and gobert was clobbering him on every floater with no call, harden still created tons of open threes and we won the series easily 4-1, how is that a stain on him lmao. And really? Dort? He can’t do shit, did you catch the game last night lmao"
Oh meant to comment on that one person Chris Paul and Kyle Lowry were 5’10”
Mine? Or the one that said DSJ has the skill of Chris Paul?
"I’m 6’10, 255 one of the most powerful players in the NBA  Chris Paul coming down here to kick my ass, get down here quick"
Chris Paul is pretty good. He should come to the Lakers.
"“Police help me, Chris Paul tryna beat me up” lolol"
"I'm feeling such deja vu when everyone used to say the same thing about James Harden, who then got Chris Paul lol"
"I’m just saying that this idea that having picks gaurentees success isn’t that true, the picks you guys have belong to really good teams so there’s no gaurentee you get a superstar like your making it out to be. Also let’s look at your player history, KD, Harden, Westbrook, Ibaka, Sabonis, Oladipo, Paul George, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, lu Dort (baby 🐐) I don’t think your team or many other teams are ever gonna top having that much talent in a decade, I just realistically don’t think you having a shit ton of Clippers, Rockets picks is as big as a deal as you think it is. You guys had The Who’s who’s of 2010 all stars I don’t think your getting any better than that"
Professor Chris Paul nods in approval
The Rockets were an affair of New Orleans Basketball past tonight. Might as well have brought Chris Paul back too. lol
Chris Paul is such a special talent
Chris Paul
Chris Paul
Chris Paul
&gt;This is a State Farm commercial.   \-Chris Paul
Chris Paul tired of losing close games so he's screaming at everyone.
Chris Paul is still so good
reddit also told me chris paul was washed  i'm sensing there's a pattern here
Still can’t believe The Suns got Chris Paul off a couple bums
These comments are why i hate this sub lmao. Like if you get what i was trying to say then dont argue for the sake of arguing   Ya obviously hes not Chris Paul. I’m saying hes got the rare baseline ability handle/shooting/athleticism to be up there with CP and Kyrie but its all untapped potential that will probably go unrealized
[Chris Paul game winner vs San Antonio ](https://youtu.be/TWrRVwwiKvI)
Lol if he had the skill of Chris Paul he wouldn’t be anywhere near the G League. I get you did that for the joke but c’mon man lol
"And I'd still argue that Skiles holding a record like getting 30 assists in a game over names like John Stockton, Magic Johnson and Chris Paul is still more notable than being a role player for a title winning team.  Not that Scott isn't more known for coaching, but I think Skiles actually has an on court achievement that distinguishes him from lets say BJ Armstrong, another Starting PG for a championship team."
"Keltner List time.  1.Was he ever regarded as the best player in basketball?  No.  2. Was he the best player on his team?  You could probably make a case, but I think most people would agree Chris Paul was better.  3. Was he the best player in basketball at his position?  Well, there's Kevin Durant, who won the MVP in what I'd consider Griffin's best year - 2013-14, where he put up a 24/9/4. I doubt you'd find many people who would have taken Blake over KD in any given year.  4. Did he have an impact on a number of playoff runs?  Yeah, until the team fell apart every year. And, aside from the 2014-15 playoffs, when he averaged 25.5/12.7/6.1, he was generally worse when it mattered. Still, those Clippers teams don't even get a chance to fail spectacularly without him, so let's say yes.  5. Was he a good enough player that he could continue to play regularly after passing his prime?  Sure isn't looking like it. Unlike a Chris Webber or Grant Hill-type, it seems like he's not going to be able to compensate for the loss of athleticism that was a huge part of his game by becoming a more savvy player. It's not that he doesn't have a great basketball IQ, but all the injuries have really left him lacking in a lot of ways, especially on defense.  6. Is he the very best player in basketball history who is not in the Hall of Fame?   Looking ahead, I doubt anyone will be making that claim, aside from a few Clippers homers.  7. Are most players who have comparable career statistics in the Hall of Fame?  Most silimar players by career arc: George McGinnis, Jimmy Butler, Peja, Harry Gallatin, Billy Cunningham, Marques Johnson, Lou Hudson, James Worthy, and Kiki Vandeweghe. So, there's a few, but not really.  8. Do the players numbers meet Hall of Fame standards?  Like OP said, BBRef gives him about a 50/50 shot, so he's not completely lacking statistically, but his long history of injuries really cut into his prime, and is definitely going to stop him from padding his stats with a graceful second half of a career.  9. Is there evidence to suggest that the player was significantly better or worse than is suggested by his statistics?  Nothing really jumps out at me, but if you have an argument, please add it.  10. Is he the best player *at his position* who is eligible for the Hall of Fame but not in?  I take Chris Webber over Blake. Some people might even put Rasheed Wallace or even Shawn Kemp (a great comp for Griffin's career arc, if you sub ""injury-prone"" for ""coke and Twinkies""), but Griffin probably won't end up the best 4 outside of the Hall.  11. How many MVP-type seasons did he have? Did he ever win an MVP award? If not, how many times was he close?  No MVP wins. Three seasons in the top 10 for MVP votes, with a high of 3rd in 2013-14.   12. How many All-Star-type seasons did he have? How many All-Star games did he play in? Did most of the other players who played in this many go into the Hall of Fame?  Only six. Again, the injuries are the culprit here, since Blake was nothing but popular throughout his career in LA.  13. If this man were the best player on his team, would it be likely that the team could win a conference final?   LOL no.   14. What impact did the player have on basketball history? Was he responsible for any rule changes? Did he introduce any new equipment? Did he change the game in any way?  I mean, he (kind of, sort of) dunked over a Kia? He's probably top 10 for basketball players turned actors?   15. Did the player uphold the standards of sportsmanship and character that the Hall of Fame, in its written guidelines, instructs us to consider?  Well, duh. Not everyone gets compared to Gandhi AND Ali.  &amp;#x200B;  So, nice career, short peak, no rings. If he gets in, it won't be the most egregious thing I've ever seen, but it'd be some weak bullshit for sure."
&gt; Hes got the skill of Chris Paul but the mentality of jake paul  lmao
"Being an NC State fan, I’ve followed DSjr since high school. Hes been babied since hes gotten to the nba. Hes got the skill of Chris Paul but the mentality of jake paul"
"To get the details right on the WB-Paul trade, per Shams: https://mobile.twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1149478200994459651?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1149478200994459651%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbleacherreport.com%2Farticles%2F2845267-nba-trade-rumors-latest-details-on-russell-westbrook-chris-paul-trade  Sources: Pick protections in Thunder/Rockets, Russell Westbrook/Chris Paul trade:  2024 first round pick, protected 1-4 2026 first round pick, protected 1-4 2025 swap, 1-20 protected 2021 swap, protected 1-4 -- OKC can swap Clippers pick or Heat pick.  What was confusing to me at the time was why Rockets paid so much - ignoring the merits of the players at the time, if Westbrook had just wanted to go to the Rockets, this is the one player where Thunder would have respected that wish (instead of trying to do the best deal) - all indications then were that Thunder would have only traded him somewhere that he wanted to go. Perhaps WB just gave a big list of teams he wanted to go to, but he had some say here."
And Chris Paul has fallen off. He’s shooting below average (54%TS vs 61%TS last year) including below 30% from 3. And his defense isn’t a great as it has been previously.   CP3 isn’t a bad player but by no means has he been better than Luka. Crediting the Suns success solely to CP3 is ridiculous. Bridges has taken a huge leap and the Suns as a whole have been better even with CP3’s decline.
I’m sure a team with Chris Paul and Blake Griffin was very humble
"Big one that I see on here is ""Deron Williams and Chris Paul were neck and neck at one point"". Some people *thought* Deron Williams and Chris Paul were neck and neck but with the benefit of better tools we can see that they were never actually that close."
Just watch Chris Paul highlights. He does it all the time.
"Do bigs passing over their heads count? The Gasols, Jokic, Sabonis, Shaq, etc have a lot of these. The first three most likely heavily influenced by the other two.  Lowe has an article showing KAT developing his passing and he kinda has a cross court pass not looking.  Search for Chris Paul no look pass. he loved to do this on fast breaks. he'd pass the ball to whomever he had behind him between his own legs."
"Ah, yes, because every team in the league has James Harden and Chris Paul.  Definitely the same situation on every team, and that's why Rudy is bad."
Westbrook has never been better better than Chris Paul outside of 2017. I'm not sure what it means that he's becoming Chris Paul. CP3 has been better the past 3 seasons and will continue to be better.
Chris Paul a bonafide choke artist
I love this arc of Chris Paul as the wise old sage going around to random young teams for a bit and showing them how to win
He's becoming Chris Paul...but worse
Trae Young Sooners  Chris Paul Wake Forest
"That's my favourite national basketball association player, Chris Paul, he plays good basketball when he dribbles the ball up the court"
He's been really solid starting while Hill is out.   Had a big bucket down the stretch of the Phoenix game beating Chris Paul off the dribble and finishing around Ayton.
"lol *partway* as if we didnt lose chris paul for 2 games and only needed to win 1 for a guranteed win. and only lost game 7 at home by single digits. i dont give a shit what happened in other years, 2018 was different"
Lmao 2016? Really? The 8th seeded rockets lmao.  And 2019 chris Paul was way worse and we were 4th seed compared to 2018 with 65 wins. 2018 was our year and golden state got lucky
Please don’t bring Chris Paul into this
"Yeah Chris Paul had a down year coming off of injury and then the very next year re-claimed his status as best point guard in the league though. It was literally one year sandwiched in between Chris Paul's career that he was the best point guard in the league.   in 2012: CP3 averaged 20/10 with 2.5 steals per game on 58% TS  in 2012: Derrick Rose averaged 22/8 on 53%TS  There was a magnificent Derrick Rose season. In reality, it was a Chris Paul era that continued until it became a debate between Westbrook, Curry, and CP3. and then eventually became the Curry era."
I think Chris Paul in 2014-2015 might have been better than D Rose in 2011.   19/5/10 on 49/40/90 shooting +20.3 On/Off Splits and All-Defensive 1st Team   Then in the playoffs put up 22/5/9 on 50/41/94 shooting
Oh he's been good. Just not Chris Paul good. Looks like he's still figuring out how to play with some of the other guys especially with Book.
"The worst argument is 2011 for sure. Fun fact about that year btw, Dwight Howard received twice as many combined 1st and 2nd place votes as Lebron.         |Player|Points|1st Place Votes|2nd Place Votes|3rd Place Votes|4th Place Votes|5th Place Votes| :--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:| |Derrick Rose (Chi)|1182|113|6|2|0|0| |Dwight Howard (Orl)|643|3|57|31|16|11| |LeBron James (Mia)|522|4|26|39|31|12| |Kobe Bryant (LAL)|428|1|18|32|40|12| |Kevin Durant (OKC)|190|0|6|10|20|38| |Dirk Nowitzki (Dal) |113|0|5|3|11|30| |Dwyane Wade (Mia)|24|0|1|1|2|6| |Manu Ginobili (SA)|20|0|2|0|0|6| |Amare Stoudemire (NY)|9|0|0|1|0|4| |Blake Griffin (LAC)|5|0|0|1|0|0| |Rajon Rondo (Bos)|5|0|0|1|0|0| |Tony Parker (SA)|3|0|0|0|1|0| |Chris Paul (NO)|2|0|0|0|0|2|"
"Manu was “injury prone” and missed a ton of games. Hall of famer.   Chris Paul, Kyrie and countless others also had many, many seasons with injuries and are/were all stars and future HoF.  Your argument is complete nonsense. We aren’t talking about the same situation as Yao Ming or Grant Hill who took a steep dive after injuries. Porzingis looks just as athletic as ever... he just needs to get back into the groove. KD is prime example of how much better big men recover from injuries.  I swear, ya’ll watch The Jump and just parrot their shitty talking points on Reddit."
"By this logic, do you consider Chris Paul to be better than Devin booker right now"
Huh? Kyrie and love missed the entire 2015 series and it still went 6. Chris Paul couldn’t play anymore after going up 3-2. It was absolutely major
Well how about this Chris Paul has had mvp type seasons while Stockton had the MVP type player on his team. There are levels to this.
Yea Chris Paul was the number 1 option on his team he didn’t have a Karl Malone for 20 years🤣
"I don't think it's too flawed. I think fans have historically put too much weight into the All-Star game when discussing careers, which has caused athletes to care about it like Conley does.  In reality, it's meant to be a rest weekend for 90% of the league while a select few get brand exposure and help get more eyes on basketball.  Russell Westbrook or Chris Paul are just more exciting All-Star game players than Mike Conley would ever be. They draw in more eyes with their name value, too. So when one of them missed like 15 games in a 50-game stretch, people would complain ""he's missed X% of the season! Conley's Grizzlies are the 5 seed and the Clippers are the 6 seed right now!"", it was actually they who missed the point of the game."
More the 3 guard lineup effect than Chris Paul himself.
Chris Paul effect
"last year's Spurs would have gotten a lot better with prime LMA, Belinelli, and demarre carroll.   last year's Lakers have prime rondo and dwight next to LeBron and AD lol then you've got the Chad dudley off the bench at that. then this year's Lakers would have DPOY Gasol  honestly, 2017 Kawhi elevates that clippers team a lot.  rockets might be on the bubble of contention with prime Oladipo, wall, Boogie, and Gordon.  76ers probably win the east with dwight Embiid big ball lmao  suns get a lot better with prime Chris Paul  do the warriors get Klay back since he's in his prime? because they'd be obviously contenders.  Cavs become the best rebounding team in the NBA and one of the scariest offenses easy with prime love."
"No, yeah of course that was the plan. Chris Paul makes too much sense on a team that needed a ball handler who could run the offense. I like the move.   I’m saying OP made it sound like Draymond’s comments weren’t completely reasonable at the time he said it, which I don’t agree with. The Suns haven’t been a particularly good team but Booker has superstar potential. There’s so many people who probably thought, “Booker has the talent to make a good team a championship contender” so I see where Draymond was coming from.  Let’s not make it sound like just because the Warriors lost to the Suns without Booker while Draymond had a bad game, that it suddenly makes a comment Draymond said in the past not make complete sense. It made complete sense actually. Hence, the Chris Paul acquisition.   I just think this is a petty move against Draymond when there’s very few people who would disagree with what he said at the time he said it (except Suns fans of course)"
Chris Paul would have to play another 10 years at his current pace to catch the assist record
I think Chris Paul will figure that out for you guys.
Wasn’t this comment before getting future HoF Chris Paul or does this not fit the narrative?
Chris Paul is better than John Stockton lmaoo
Monty Williams man Monty Williams helluva coach and he deserves his flowers for turning the Suns around. They don’t get Chris Paul without Monty making them a decent team last year.
shaq and chuck talking about chris paul and blake griffin cheer me up when i'm down
i like shaq...who can forget his exchange with chuck about chris paul trying to beat up blake griffin?
Chris Paul made a difference
Chris Paul is one of the top 50 greatest players to ever play the game. Hell he's maybe in the top 25. Prime CP3 in late 2000s was absolute 🔥
Chris Paul tryna beat me up
Bro that’s not Chris Paul that’s Cliff Paul
Bro you just made me look up if Chris Paul was 48 I thought I somehow missed a decade of my life
Chris Paul veering then stopping in front of the defense in transition to bait fouls for over a decade has been one of my least favorite moves in all of basketball. It’s dangerous and has inspired other idiots (Pat Bev) to do it. So glad to see it getting phased out of the game
"You’re kidding right? Most people thought Dragic would’ve been an above average starter then because the only reason he wasn’t starting was because Nash was on the team.   The Hornets didn’t want to pay anyone because they had no way of making salary, that’s why the owner sold in the first place and why they traded chris Paul.   The clippers sold high on a dude who they knew was gonna be an injury risk. He was already declining in games played every season and minutes played.   That’s without mentioning the other 3 guys"
"I love Chris Paul as a player and I've been watching since his rookie year... he was literally trying to do BOTH of those things.  It was either a lob to Ayton... or Holmes bumps him and he falls over.   This year they decided ""NO CALL FOR YOU"" and now we get this."
the legend of magic johnson has gotten crazier and crazier  HE WAS LIKE CHRIS PAUL MEETS DRAYMOND AND HE BREATHED FIRE
Chris paul is an asshole
"Chris Paul, no longer the master baiter I once revered him as"
Fuck that bullshit move Chris Paul tried to pull.
I think twenty years of watching Chris Paul play tells you the answer
"""what a crafty veteran that Chris Paul fellow is."""
Chris Paul played for the Thunder in the bubble l.
"I usually give athletes the benefit of the doubt in situations since I’ve never actually met them or know the situation fully. Anyways, Fuck Chris Paul"
"What the hell? No.  The trade for Chris Paul would've netted New Orleans...  1. Lamar Odom, after he played his best season and won 6th man of the year 2. Kevin Martin, a young 20 point scorer 3. Luis Scola, who was above average at PF 4. Goran Dragic, who was good enough to help lead the Suns to a 50 win team  Bro that's a near playoff team, add 1 mid tier lottery guy and the team is pretty good. Some of those guys were expiring contracts, which was ALSO good, because back then, a guy with an expiring contract was gold for teams that wanted to play in the Free Agent market.   Okay with that said, Stern vetoed that trade of multiple good players for...  Eric Gordon, who was constantly injured and had some injury concerns prior to the trade, also was mostly empty stats on the Clippers.   Al Farouq Aminu, a project player who was BAD when he was in New Orleans and made himself into a journeyman.  Chris Kaman, who was close to washed.  ABSOLUTE MADNESS -- THE ONLY ONE OF THESE PLAYERS TO MAKE AN ALL STAR TEAM AFTER THIS WAS IN THE OTHER FUCKING TRADE HE VETO'D."
Hahahahaha fuck Chris Paul
He doesn't like Harden's foul baiting but he's a fan of Chris Paul? LMFAO
Chris Paul the type of dude to pull out a tape measurer to check if you’re too close for your serve
"It will be a point guard, because they multitask and plan well. Someone mid to late career, because young guys don't know how to cook yet. And it has to be someone well connected in the league, who knows enough people to throw a party. Pool party reads as a more southern thing, or at least a player that had a pool at their house at home, and typically entertains around it. And finally, this player needs to have lost in the early rounds of the bubble.   CHRIS PAUL."
"And right after the foul Pat Bev commended the officials on calling it, acknowledging that it was a good call.  Was nice to see.  When you're out there with a victim mindset you're not going to play your best.  Thinking the officials owe you shit, constantly feeling slighted.  It palpably reverberates throughout the roster and makes the sport a pain to watch, just a bunch of dudes trying to cheese out a win any way possible. the chris paul way."
"I don't what he does, it's your anecdote, but someone like Chris Paul is a business, you can be a manager, run his (probable) charities, property manager, etc."
"He didn't move abruptly sideways into the defender. He got in front of the defender, then stopped. The veering highlighted in the video is jumping sideways into the defender, which Chris Paul did not do. Rather, he stopped moving entirely. While in this case he lost control of the ball, should the defender have run into him, it would remain a *defensive* foul as usual.  Hope this helps!"
"I was rooting for the suns last year, although I don't hate that Milwaukee won.   Chris Paul is an easy person to hate. The rest of your team seems pretty good though. Ayton seems like a great dude and future star."
"&gt;How very Black and White of you.  Here is the correct nuanced approach:  ""Fuck Chris Paul, but not Ayton.""  Ya, that's some good nuance there."
I can't fathom how someone would not care for Chris Paul but really like Cam Payne.
"I was speaking from an aesthetic pov, it became more dynamic with chris paul although Dantoni fumbled that shit."
"Fuck Chris Paul, easily one of the 5 dirtiest players in the league. People have started liking him more since he has become the old-vet leader of men lifting up young Thunder and Suns teams, and he deserves credit for that, but he is still a reckless and dirty player who does all kinds of deplorable bullshit on the court."
There's only a few dudes who dress like normal people lol. Chris Paul and Steph come to mind. Draymond and Book. Maybe it's the locker room. Those boys in Miami get wild with the fits
This is exactly why I hate Chris Paul and the Suns. They rather pull stunts like this to antagonize their opponents instead of actually playing basketball. Even worse is when they try to play it off as if they're innocent! Smh
Because they never said that. lol. What a fucking stupid conversation. The problem is they mistakenly thought they had a shot at getting Chris Paul or Kyle Lowry. They settled for Graham. They didn’t pick him over Ball.
The Harden and Chris Paul tricks are pretty equivalent to hitters and pitchers taking fucking forever between pitches. It ruins the product of the game as a fan. The rule is a good thing and encourages good offensive and defensive play.
Fuck Chris Paul
"Fuck the suns, Chris Paul and Devin booker are such whiny players."
I would be astounded to find a random person who doesn’t hate Chris Paul.
Anyone who has ever watched Chris Paul play basketball knows he was absolutely trying to draw a foul.  Remember his punk ass flop attempt when he was walking backwards in front of Cousins and then abruptly stopped so he could pretend like Cousins ran him over while he dramatically flung his arms out at the slightest contact and made the bitchiest whiny face known to humanity?   Grown ass man who cried wolf doesn't get the benefit of the doubt after 15 years of crying wolf.
"Yeah he doesnt see it. But if Chris Paul keeps his dribble and keeps Holmes on his back, no one is stopping Ayton from having that free run to the basket. That is what I meant to say I guess. It is just creating a free 2 on 1."
Chris Paul would not be able to understand that sentence.
"Exactly me, I stopped following basketball for awhile so when I found out the suns were in the finals, I initially supported them and thought it was great.         Then I found out they have Chris Paul.        I hope that guy retires ringless."
Im glad the Wolves picked up low-IQ Chris Paul. We going straight to the title.
Chris Paul is such a fraud and not a top 5 PG
"I mean, he was pretty obviously joking, BUT, ""Undersized PG who is one of the dirtiest players in the NBA"" the comparisons are not completely unfounded, just not totally accurate as they are miles apart in skill. Saying that however, fuck Chris Paul, I actually gain warmth at night when I am cold by thinking about him never winning a championship and dick punching his way to his ultimate achievement...a finals loss in the twilight of his career."
I'm sorry but some? I know we're on the Chris Paul hate train but you're severely underselling Chris Paul's skill with that one.
"https://twitter.com/NBAOfficial/status/1443591684173017091?s=20  and you can't hear LOL  it's literally IN the video for an offensive player veering off course. Holy shit it's impressive how confidently wrong redditors are.  If the defender continued into Chris Paul it would be a *defensive* foul, just like is said in the video 😂😂"
"Everyone in here shitting on Chris Paul (correctly so) but Richaun Holmes played that perfectly, almost as if he pulled the chair at the edge of the logo."
I simply cannot believe that everyone you talk basketball with thinks Chris Paul is a good guy and is astounded when you say you don't like him.
It's like 90% Chris Paul 10% crowder.  Rest are cool.
Chris Paul would have to stop playing lol
"God I fking hate Chris Paul.  He and Harden are the 2 most to blame for ushering in the foul-hunting, flopping, BS style of play.  Love the negative karma, failures, and humiliation that they have both experienced the last ... decade.  They deserve it."
"This is why I'm so torn on calling it 'foul baiting.' It looked like Chris Paul was trying to keep Holmes on his hip, which is taught in basketball so you can create separation or draw the defense on you for a pass."
IIRC Lillard did that to a Chris paul team a few years back and he got all pissy about it.
"This is true, but I would note that risky and reckless passes can lead to a triple double assist line, but it can also lead to higher turnovers. So a player that doesn't get a ton of triple doubles (like Chris Paul) due to much better judgment on passing is helping his team more than Westbrook where he makes too many risky passes that are not a net positive (or as net a positive as Paul's passes)."
I hope Chris Paul never wins a ring. I hate that stupid fuck.
Also didn't Chris Paul in college punch a guy below the belt. Let's be honest. Chris is a dirty player so is Rondo. They both have a lot of issues they have to work out.
"Chris Paul was punching Julius Hodge in the nuts in college. It’s amazing his reign of fuckery has lasted this long without someone blatantly taking him out.   Ironically, I’ve met him before a few times over the last two decades and he may legitimately be the nicest person I’ve ever met lol. And apparently everyone finds him likable off the court."
Literally anybody I talk basketball with. They’re like “how can you NOT like Chris Paul he’s just such a good guy” or some bs
&gt;	Chris Paul is really just high IQ Pat Bev  When the circlejerk goes too far
"Just curious why you put Chris Paul and Westbrook on the same level? Maybe I'm just missing something, and I understand not liking Westbrook's playstyle or thinking it doesn't lead to winning basketball, but by all accounts he seems like a stand up guy and doesn't play dirty at all.  Meanwhile CP3 has a history of flops, foul baiting, and dirty plays."
"My opinion, that I tell everyone who will listen: Chris Paul is too talented to play like such a punk ass bitch. He does shit that guys without the talent to be there do to try help their team, but a bunch of that dirty shit is so beneath what he should be. I'll never respect his game because of shit like this."
We have to wait and see if they’ll call it on players like Chris Paul. He’s always gotten away with shit regardless of rules.
"I think I hate Chris Paul more than any other basketball player. He gets away with all this stupid bullshit. What he was trying to do should be an offensive foul. He’s trying to dribble backwards into a 6’10” dude’s knees. I’m shocked he hasn’t ended someone’s season with that move, it seems like it could go really bad.  Other greatest hits: spitting on Rondo, LeBron “box out” undercut, and the jumping 2 feet to the right for a 3 on Pat Bev. And that all from like the last 3 years. Then endless amounts of kick-outs that are supposed to be offensive fouls that he still doesn’t get called for, the flops, and this dumb move.  TL;DR: Chris Paul is a reckless, dirty, piece of shit who tries to injure people and flops like a fish for the slightest contact but still gets in State Farm commercials"
"For real, instead of trading for Westbrook they should of saved the picks and players they got rid of an actually tried harder to get Chris Paul"
Chris Paul is a piece of shit
And people are astounded when I tell them I don’t like Chris Paul. I cannot stand watching garbage like this
&gt;Idk if this was foul baiting  Just watch Chris Paul from any game in the last few years. It's 100% a foul bait
Why is one of the highest IQ players matched up against Chris Paul?
Chris Paul hasn't been great the last couple of games
The argument for best floor general is between Chris Paul and LeBron.
"meh. Looking at [this](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?ContextMeasure=FGA&amp;EndPeriod=0&amp;EndRange=28800&amp;GameID=0022100062&amp;PlayerID=101108&amp;RangeType=0&amp;Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;StartPeriod=0&amp;StartRange=0&amp;TeamID=1610612756&amp;flag=3&amp;sct=plot&amp;section=game), it looks like Davion Mitchell only guarded Chris Paul for 1 of his 10 FGA (missed). The other shots were guarded mostly by Fox and Haliburton"
"They should be able to, but Chris Paul and the like ruined this for everyone. If you just go out seeking contact to get bonus free throws, you have bastardised the rule to the wrong ends.  Hopefully, once players adjust, things will just get back to normal and this will mostly be a no call."
Love watching Chris Paul lose 🥲
Go fuck yourself Chris Paul. As is tradition
chris paul
Looks like Chris Paul had an Off Night
Chris Paul shot 1-10 tonight and accumulated six (6) points. Hield would look really good on the 1-3 Phoenix Suns right now next to Devin Booker.
"Chris Paul will barely ever go 1-10, Johnson and Crowder will barely ever go 0-9 from 3 combined"
"Right cus no other player has ever wanted out of any other franchises.  We've had one player in recent memory not want to be in New Orleans; Anthony Davis.  Chris Paul wanted to stay in New Orleans, he loved the city, but saw that his current situation wasn't working and asked for a trade. He's said before that he cried when he got traded because there was a part of him that didn't want to leave."
I like how new league rules were because of Harden and Chris Paul. I didn't even know this Chris Paul rule existed until this clip.
"Amir was in the same draft class as Chris Paul, Danny Granger, Deron Williams and Ray Felton. That's like six years before Kawhi entered the league."
"Kyrie as Kendrick Perkins is fucking hilarious.  I think CJ McCullom will be in the mix in some way. I could see jimmy butler being some kind of personality as well. I don’t know much about Nic Batum as a personality but definitely agree about Chris Paul, JJ, Draymond, maybe Russell but he’s the one I’m not as sure of."
Also the fact the league fucked over the Lakers so hard with the Chris Paul trade.
"Trae does it while going around a screen, I haven't seen him do it in transition. Doing it in transition is the classic Chris Paul move.   Instead of labeling everything flopping, people should take the time to distinguish each player's specific strengths in foul-drawing. They're not all the same!"
The Chris Paul special.
"Yes, they literally all do.  There is 100% a correlation between usage rate and turnovers.  The higher your usage rate, the more turnovers you get.  Some are better than others, obviously, but literally everything we know about basketball proves this.  Even Chris Paul gets more turnovers when his usage rate goes up, and his usage rate has never been as high as WB's."
"JJ Redick eventually becoming an analyst has gotten be the least surprising news in NBA history. The new Tim Legler.   Kyle Korver also has a job if he wants it. CJ McCollum has any NBA job he wants the day after he retires, same with Chris Paul (CP could do the Isiah Thomas thing and literally go into EVERY facet of basketball job)."
"Why would playmaking be better than efficient volume scoring?   How many championships do Steve Nash, Chris Paul, John Stockton have? Is playmaking ability the thing that has made Curry more successful than these players?"
"This is a big part of why the Lakers were so bad for a couple years there. People today like to just trash the Lakers for being so poorly run or whatever, but the truth is they really went all in that year with Dwight and Nash to try to make one or two more title runs with Kobe and it blew up spectacularly because of injuries and Dwight leaving.   Dwight was coming off back surgery that year and has never been the same player after that, Nash broke his leg in his second game with the Lakers (and suffered permanent nerve damage and he also was never the same player again), and Kobe tore his Achilles and he too was never the same player after that. That was all on top of the Chris Paul veto which alienated Odom (who demanded to be traded) and Pau.   No matter what, after going all in like that with all the players and picks sent out to put that team together, the Lakers were giving away their future to try to win in the present. The only problem was their present was killed by injuries, so it was just bad for them all around. It would be like if immediately after the Clippers getting Paul George and Kawhi, Kawhi suffered a career altering injury and PG left in free agency a year later. You can't fault the Lakers for trying to go all in to win, but people still today think they were just the victims of poor management. That was a factor later, for sure, but putting together a team of Kobe, Pau, Dwight and Nash at the time was seen as the title favorites, but that all blew up, of course."
"""To this day, everyone always asks me, 'Well why did you keep Chris Paul from going to the Lakers?' I didn't keep him. I didn't approve the trade. No team sells or trades a future Hall of Famer without the owner signing off, and I was the owner's rep. But I wasn't going to hand up Dell Demps.""   Find it for me then🤷‍♀️"
"Mmmm true. If flagrants are called for like, non-flagrant contact in fast break situations, is there a situation where the offensive team (read: Chris Paul) could exploit that?"
It doesn't get discussed because they ended up doing fine and getting CP3 shortly after. The pick being #1 was super unlikely (they should have tried to protect it at least).  I thought it was bad at the time because I thought Baron was still solid and Mo Williams wasn't that big of an upgrade for me. Definitely not a first round pick better.   And the Clippers didn't seem like they erred going to be good anytime soon. You had nice young stars like Blake and Gordon (I seriously thought he'd be the next star SG after Wade and Kobe haha) but not much else. Upgrading Baron to Mo doesn't really move the needle imo.  Then they signed win now vets in Caron Butler and Chauncey Billups and traded for a top 5 player in Chris Paul in the off season.
"I thought the Rockets looked much better on offense in 2019 as a whole actually aside from Chris Paul  It's just that the defense, especially Capela, was way worse"
"2 way players need to be prioritized over scoring gods. If you aren't also playmaking for others, scoring doesn't impress me - most dudes in the NBA think they can score. Locking up on defense, or keeping a known flamethrower under 30 pts is more valuable than league minimum and a bunch of criticism about how they can't play basketball. This is fully why I believe the big has been devalued today - literally most of the MVP candidates last year were 7 footers, an athletic big has been a top 2 pick as long as I can remember, and the two teams in the finals last year punished the paint.   Equally unpopular is the idea that mid range scoring is dead, when you can't really name a top scorer who isn't deadly from midrange. KD, Kawhi, Chris Paul, Khris Middleton, Devin Booker, and so many more LIVE in the mid range. It's literally like 75 percent of all usable offensive floor space. Curry can do a LOT more than shoot threes, I think he's got most kids mind warped about what good basketball is."
"[Curry being Curry, and Harden doing things like this.](https://twitter.com/KevinOConnorNBA/status/1127057378451644418?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1127057378451644418%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goldenstateofmind.com%2F2019%2F5%2F11%2F18566495%2Fnba-2019-warriors-rockets-game-6-steph-curry-james-harden-chris-paul-klay-thompson-kevin-durant)"

Jokic   Kevin Garnett  Steph Curry  Durant  Chris Paul
"Chris Paul, Dwight Howard are the bigger than anyone Dallas has got.  Carmelo also requested a trade here in 2014 but Knicks didn’t want to trade him."
Chris Paul played worse.
Clippers. I loved the Lob City teams because Chris Paul is one of my favourite players ever. Kawhi Leonard might be my favourite player ever so I like them now too.
"Alright then a lot of guys aren’t winners. Chris Paul, Dame, James Harden, Westbrook. They’re still great players tho, going down in the history books"
"A literal inner circle? wtf is Kidd thinking? I loved him as a player, he is my second favorite PG behind only Chris Paul... but man, Kidd as a coach looks kinda lost. At least he moved Giannis to a pseudo PG position and that works wonders for him (only when Kidd was out there, but...)"
I think it would legit be possible if he played with Chris Paul. We’ve never really managed to pair him with a good lob thrower.
"Oh my, Chris Paul is my favorite player but damn that made me laugh"
"I thought Luka would be a bust   i thought Tatum would be a bust   i thought Simmons, Ingram and Jaylen Brown would be busts  i thought KAT would be a bust   i thought Embiid would be a bust and specifically thought Jokic would be a bust at #41  i thought Bennett would be the GOAT and Giannis would be a bust   i thought AD, Beal and Dame would be busts and Miami should have traded LeBron to draft MKG #1  i thought Kyrie would be a bust and Kawhi was a massive reach at #15  i thought Wall and Cousins and Paul George would be busts   i thought Blake, Harden, Curry, DeRozan and Jrue would be the five worst players in the draft   i thought Rose and Love would be busts and that Westbrook would play for 20 years and never get a triple double   i thought Durant was too skinny and should have gone in the second round  i thought LMA was a bust and Rondo and Lowry were the two worst PGs in the draft   i thought Deron Williams and Chris Paul were busts  i thought Dwight was a bust   i thought LeBron was a bust"
C. Paul.   No that's too obvious.   Chris P.
Rondo's kind of a piece of shit generally and Chris Paul ain't some sweet dove himself.
"Naw this one made me laugh.  Reminds me of all the ""rockets are x-0 when Chris Paul, James harden and Clint capela play together.""   Then they lost and someone posted   ""rockets are x-0 against teams not named the pelicans when Chris Paul, James harden and Clint capela play together."""
This isn't completely accurate. Look at Chris Paul. u can still get covid despite being vaccinated although odds from what I've seen are slim. Just take good precautions while at the game if you decide to go.
but Silver's schedule gave Chris Paul covid.
Hey man I’m here for it   As a long suffering Clippers fan....if we can even make WCF finals without Kawhi I’ll be happy   Obv if we lose we rooting for our boy Chris Paul to win it all tho
Anyone in a contract year should play with Chris Paul if they want to get paid. Schroder missed it by one year.
Right? lol I wouldn't put it past him either. That dude hates Chris Paul.
Wow. I don't like the clippers or Chris Paul but damn...
"I mean there’s the Chris Paul Covid stuff, we’re the only fucking team that can sweep a series and somehow still take an L"
Chris Paul never lead them to a conference finals though.
did Chris Paul die?
"Yes tell me more about how your role players are equivalent to Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Kyrie Irving or Chris Paul."
Wait so did chris Paul catch covid?
"The amount of clowning this sub does on guys trying to gut through injury is incredible  Saw it with LeBron, Chris Paul, Mitchell, etc."
"Chris Paul stabbed his Ruby Gobert voodoo doll today, cursing the Jazz with Covid blood magic."
The real winner of this game is Chris Paul.
Probably home. Please let Chris Paul be healthy so the Suns can sweep the Clippers
Since we can't make fun of playoff P anymore we gotta meme that Utah politician that unIronically liked that Kawhi and Chris Paul were hurt
 &gt;He’s out there hugging Donovan Mitchell only to learn that Mitchell is positive so Chris Paul is in limbo waiting for his tests to come back.  Anybody else here the Curb Your Enthusiasm music play after reading this?
Grandpa Chris Paul and adolescent Booker hugging each other watching this game in fear
"I don’t think Chris Paul is gonna be out long, Kawhi could be out though I still think the Clippers are deep enough to battle though  Morris and Jackson have been playing like stars"
…with an injured Chris Paul (MVP candidate). Ain’t the Suns fault the Lakers shipped off their bigs from last season and forced an injury prone AD to be more physical this year 🤷‍♂️  You can only play who you play.  One correction though… Suns haven’t beaten anyone this post season. They’ve obliterated them.  I’m more confused why you don’t have the Suns #1… which of these teams playing right now is supposed to stop them?
Chris Paul will be back. He will miss at most 1 game IMO
Without Chris Paul?
chris Paul is worth 6 ben simmons
No Chris Paul so prob still will
Oh wait Chris Paul checks in
"Imagine having Chris Paul on this jazz team, he’d be able to set up Rudy all the time and take advantage of his size offensively against this small clipper team"
Chris Paul in basketball form.
Chris Paul
Except Chris paul is now out
Chris Paul levels unlucky
"It's worth considering from the perspective of the league's overall health. Certainly the longterm legacy and value of the league matters more to Kawhi and LeBron than a guy on a two-way contract who's going to be done in 2 seasons.   I just don't think the NBPA (or any union) is setup that way. From a labor perspective, it's much harder to see the benefit of being in a union if you get less say than a guy who is going to be around longer than you and make more in a season than you do in your career. If that were the case, I'd probably be better off negotiating directly with management/ownership—or even teaming up with players in a similar salary bracket as me.  The owners have the same problem—Robert Pera and Dan Gilbert are equals when the Board of Governors meets. Gilbert doubtless has a lot of influence as the owner if the Knicks, but he still only gets one vote. It's on the commissioner to prevent the owners from voting for interests that only benefit them in the short term or that hurt the longterm viability of the league. It helps to have voices like Cuban that are strongly concerned about the longterm, but the commissioner can come at it from a more neutral position.  The NBPA is led by players, but I think that means that it's hard to 100% trust leadership if you aren't one of the top guys. They try to address this by having guys like Garrett Temple be a VP, but ultimately players are going to trust their agent over Chris Paul when it comes to money."
Always happens to chris paul wtf
Luka's below him? And Chris Paul? And Dame barely ahead? Lol.
I don't get any vibes from Chris Paul at all. The most exposure we see of him are tv commercials. A few interviews don't give much insight into anyone.
Replace Ben Simmons with Chris Paul and the Sixers have two championships already. Having your second best player average under 14 ppg in the playoffs and 11.6 ppg in this series is just nowhere near enough.
"Jokic was turned into a turnstile by a 36 y.o. Chris Paul and his middies.  At least Embiid defends.  Come to think of it all the dominant bigs of the league (Jokic, Embiid, Giannis) are about to be out by the 2nd round. So much for the return of the big in the modern NBA.   Its sad really. I grew up in the '90s when monsters would clash, I much prefer that era to return over the incessant 3pt shooting of today ... It will need time it seems like..."
Well it ain't Chris Paul this time
"We’ve gotten the Chris Paul, Clippers, and Doc experience all in one day. What a time to be alive."
This is the dumbest news ever. Poor Chris Paul. He finally gets a good run going too.
Bruh Luka is in his 3rd year 😭😭😭  Y’all acting like he Chris Paul or smth
Chris Paul got vaccinated? I thought the report earlier said he didn’t.
Classic Chris Paul.
"I personally apologize to you Suns fan, for the trauma I’ve caused by making a joke about Chris Paul possibly being an antivaxxer. I’ll think more carefully about my words next time and will do my best to become a better person"
"Not true, but even if half of it wasn’t playing defense doesn’t that go directly against the claim you made earlier?  People would make the argument that Curry is a high effort player on the defensive side of the ball, unless you don’t really know basketball. Steals leaders are consistently some of the top defenders in the league, which is why players like Kawhi, Chris Paul, and Simmons are all over that list.   Going back to the original reason I responded to you: you said all players only care about their offense and only offensive minded players get paid. That point was a bad one and I hope you see that now."
"If healthy, but Harden is hurt right now and Chris Paul has COVID. We’d also probably have zero depth if this happened."
"&gt; I've talked to people irl that were afraid of getting the second one due to people having bad reactions and thinking ""one should be enough for me"". &gt;I think Chris Paul would be smarter than that  Maybe you don’t know, but their are people getting bad reactions after the 1st and don’t get the 2nd because it will likely be worse. Some Doctors even advise not to get the 2nd if you have a terrible reaction like hives/rashes.   So it has nothing to do with “being smart” for some people out there"
Chris Paul gonna be questionable for Game 1 of the NBA Finals with “magically turned into a cardboard cutout”
It has to be Chris Paul…

"Seth Curry, Chris Paul, Tatum, Durant because people forget, Mitchell, Trae Young, Derrick Rose"
"They should have never traded Chris Paul for Westbrook, that was their biggest fuck up"
Of course. Two things are guaranteed when it comes playoff time. Paul George vanishes and Chris Paul goes out. Maybe its just the name Paul
"suns steamrolled the lakers when they were all healthy though lmfao  that series had both teams superstars go down in injury, suns were the better team if they matchup healthy  suns fans were worried af after chris paul had to overcome his shoulder that series, he lost his shooting touch mid series"
Chris Paul has the highest BQ of all time.
"Chris Paul is always chirping, getting into beefs, and sometimes makes dirty plays. I'm sure that has something to do with why Nick Young had no hesitation in throwing shade at him. Not just a random insensitive jab. Consider the context."
I find that hard to believe when the Lakers just won with two guys on a max contract. Bucks seem to be fine with Giannis on a supermax. Nets have two guys on a max and one on a supermax. Clippers have two on a max. Gobert is on a max. Chris Paul is on a max.   Every championship contending team has players on the max so it can't disintegrate your teambuilding options too much. The only time max contracts hurt your cap is when the player doesn't play up to the level of the contract and that most likely won't be an issue with Luka.   Also the cap isn't real
I don't think he's gonna pull the I told you so card for Chris Paul lmao
"&gt;Pau Gasol was a top 10 player those years,  Kobe, LeBron, Wade, Duncan, Chris Paul, Dirk, Garnett, Nash, Pierce, Melo, Amare, Bosh and Manu all easily had arguments over him wtf."
Chris Paul: “i wish to be the best 6 foot guard of all time”
"I mean to start off... Bird wasn't that far behind Curry in terms of being a good FT shooter.  Bird had 93% years on much higher attempts per game.  Curry's best was 93.4%, with 1 less attempt per game.  As far as midrange stuff....   https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shooting/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=5-9%20ft.%20FG%20PCT&amp;dir=1&amp;PerMode=Totals  You can go thorough and look for yourself.  Does he have good stats, during one of his best seasons of his career?  Sure.  But it's mostly due to his 3 point shooting.  His 2 point shooting while good isn't even tops in the league, let alone tops all time.  I agree Chris Paul is good at midrange.  Compare him to Steph Curry.  It's not even close.  Chris Paul this year ABSOLUTELY DEMOLISHED Curry from midrange... it's not even a TINY bit close.  It's a massive Chasm between ""all time great midrange shooters"" like Paul and Bird, and Steph Curry."
"Sure, but is it reasonable for them to be worried about Chris Paul giving them covid if they are willingly not getting a vaccine?"
Steph is a better midrange and free throw (GOAT %) shooter than anybody who is better than him at midrange is close to him 3P. He also has insane midrange % but doesn’t take them often because that would just be stupid for him it has nothing to do with his height. Chris Paul is well shorter than him and one of the best at it.
The basketball gods legitimately have it out for Chris Paul
Remember when Chris Paul was rumored to be going to the Bucks? State Farm remembers.
It would be darkly funny if Chris Paul contracted it when he went into the crowd to celebrate after winning the series.
"Ok, well I think that it is fun that you ignore everything I said that counters what you said, and instead focus only on the part that I didn't address, the breakthrough cases.   So i'll go ahead and address that, then:  Efficacy is the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated. Because most unvaccinated people haven't caught COVID in the last few months. You can't just attribute all not-COVID cases to the vaccine when most unvaccinated people didn't get it during that time. That's astoundingly ludicrous.      For an example of how using breakthrough cases is ridiculous:      Lets say that I'm one of the people who isn't protected by the vaccine and can have a breakthrough case. Lets say that I contract COVID 7 months from now.      Well, for the next 7 months, YOU would count me as someone who is protected by the vaccine because I haven't gotten COVID yet. Do you see why that is misleading?  For Chris Paul, for the last 4 months, using breakthrough cases you would have considered him impervious to COVID due to the vaccine.   Can you see the flaw in your reasoning?"
A lot of teams have seemingly gotten away from taking advantage of mismatches. Suns do it but I think that's because of Chris Paul. I'm not exactly sure what the reasoning is that teams have gotten away from it.  Perhaps statistics? If so it's a misapplication. Just because a three is better most of the time doesn't mean you disregard certain matchups in a given situation. That's what basketball IQ is for.
"It sucks for Chris Paul and I wish him a speedy recovery, but that’s still pretty amazing considering it felt like whole teams were going down left right and center just a few months ago."
"For privacy's sake, let's call him Chris P. No, that's much too obvious, umm... Let's say C. Paul."
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/fantasy/basketball/news/suns-chris-paul-tests-positive-for-covid-19/amp/   “Shams Charania of The Athletic broke the news earlier Wednesday that Paul entered the health and safety protocol, but it wasn't immediately clear whether the point guard tested positive for the virus, or was a close contact of an infected persons or persons. With Paul confirmed to have tested positive, he'll now have to complete an isolation period, though the 36-year-old may be in line for a shorter absence after having previously received the Pfizer vaccine in February”  So yeah all that arguing and aggressiveness just for the possibility someone else mentioned to come true. And it didn’t even take a full day for that news to come out."
"For real! Can't stand seeing someone compete the way he does. There's playing hard, and then the tripping, arm yanking, etc that Chris Paul constantly does. A big part of his play style is defined by bitch moves. He's ultra talented, but I sincerely hope he never wins. It's a shame, I really like the rest of this Suns squad, but Chris Paul is so slimy."
Holy fuck if I were Chris Paul rn lol
Chris Paul may legitimately be cursed.
"It definitely was not a dumb argument. LeBron wasn't healthy for that entire series and AD missed the last three games. Chris Paul was definitely limited for 2-3 games as well, but it's not like both teams were equally injured or healthy. Additionally both KCP and Caruso got hurt in that series and missed time. There was a distinct injury difference between the two teams. Then Phoenix played a Denver team missing their second best player as well as some other role players and starters.   It's not like it's the Suns fault or something, so when people say they were fortunate with injury luck as compared to everyone else, it isn't a knock against them. Maybe they would have won anyway, who knows. But it is just factually accurate to say they've been playing teams that were decimated by injuries. That's just objectively true. As for CP3's current situation, we still don't know if he'll even miss a game because of it."
"The vast majority of individuals don’t have any of the things you just mentioned. Doesn’t that make Chris Paul one of the luckiest ppl on the planet? The fact that he’s able to continue playing basketball on a high level despite being injured year after year is pretty damn lucky.   Oh, did you mean winning a chip? You’re exactly what’s wrong with the NBA - everyone is a failure unless they win a ring. Legacy? Chris Paul is the President of the NBPA and sends kids to Wake Forest University on a scholarship in honor of his granddad who was beaten to death. Achievements? Only 20% of eligible NBA players voted in the 2016 election until NBPA President Chris Paul led efforts to increase registered NBA players to over 90% before the next election. How history will remember Chris Paul? That depends on if you think he’s a bum for not winning a ring or if there’s more to life than money and basketball lmao"
the real chris paul was executed by a guantanimo bay military tribunal and replaced with a clone
your boy chris paul is the head of the players association...
Chris Paul used the monkey's paw instead
I'm pretty sure any time since April of 2020 it would be news.   Like could you imagine how big of a news story it would be if in April of 2020 Chris Paul got vaccinated as part of the vaccine trails.   I mean I guess Paul wouldn't know if he got the real thing or a placebo during the trail but it would be a massive news story.
"You'd get killed for proposing that trade months ago. Chris Paul was always injured before his newer plant based diet and dropped off in his last Houston season. They did it right imo, thinking Jrue has more years left and gives them a bigger window to contend."
"Chris Paul does commercials for State Farm, a major competitor for Allstate"
"I'm confused on what big injuries were overuse injuries? Jaylen browns wrist doesn't seem it, Murray's ACL? Perhaps? Kyrie rolled his ankle. Bron hurt his ankle too. Harden has a long offseason. Chris Paul is unvaccinated."
Isn’t LeBron the VP of the NBPA and his friend Chris Paul the President?
5'5 Chris Paul is a pretty great image
Chris Paul out indefinitely for a positive Covid test SVG out as coach for the Pelicans Scott Brooks out as coach for the Wizards  Mike Conley out for tonight’s game with a hamstring sprain
Paul Chris
And of course that one fucking player is Chris Paul. He's cursed.
"Just make a press statement if that’s the case tbh. ‘We the Phoenix suns and Chris Paul are very confident in a quick resolution to this matter due to him being vaccinated. Being vaccinated doesn’t remove 100% of the chance of getting COVID but greatly diminishes the duration and severity, as far as eliminating 99% of hospitalisations’."
"Ayton only played 38 games last season due to the suspension and we still just barely missed the playoffs. IMO Chris Paul replacing Rubio took us from what would have a been a 5-8th seed to a 1-4 seed (obviously we took 2nd). People don't seem to realize that the bubble suns wasn't a fluke. We have needed a point guard for years. Last season we got one, this season we got a point God."
"“Definitely”   It’s extremely debatable whether or not he is. I personally lean towards him being the 1b to Bookers 1a. He can no longer be Chris Paul for 48 minutes like he was with the Clippers, he has to do it in bursts which is why his partnership with Booker works so well for him."
"Okay, so then trials showed a ~ 97% efficacy rate, confirmed by PCR testing. That just shows further proof that Chris Paul is extremely freaking unlucky to be vaccinated and have caught Covid."
uknowhat God bless Chris Paul
And the Suns just lost Chris Paul for the foreseeable future to COVID protocol.
"Fair enough.   In any case, there are multiple reports that Chris Paul is indeed vaccinated."
Not surprising. I think that people want to see Chris Paul get a ring and the Suns have not ever won before.
I like Chris Paul.  Chris Paul is on the Suns.  They have sick jerseys.  Not that difficult.
actually chris paul managed it last year for the thunder
Woooow that Chris Paul take is god awful.
"Chris Paul, I understand Devin Booker and DeAndre ayton are playing well but without Chris Paul the Phoenix Suns would just be about their usual bottom 5 in the west self oh, and I know everybody likes to go on about how they went undefeated in the bubble oh, yes they went undefeated in the bubble and still didn't make the playoffs because they weren't good enough throughout the regular season"
Chris Paul is the closest imo
Chris Paul by a country mile wtf
"2011 where Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo and Deron Williams battle it out for top PG bragging rights"
Chris Paul. This actually should not be a question.
"I think Embiid will miss too much time for voters to get him.  LeBron has to win a lot of games sense his base stats aren’t on the level of other dudes but I’d say he’s my favorite to win.  I could see Jokic winning if he’s close enough to LeBron in wins but I just dk. If we’re talking about individual play only than he’s first.   Chris Paul is interesting, but I just don’t think it will happen, call me ignorant.  Sense voters seem to hate Harden and don’t want Giannis 3-peating it I’d say they are hard as well.   Imo:Jokic, Harden, LeBron, Giannis, Embiid (idk if he’ll play enough) and CP3/Kawhi/Dame.  What will happen:LeBron, Embiid, Jokic, Giannis, CP3, Harden, Kawhi/Dame"
He completely phoned it in when he was on our team. That said... he did get us Kelly Oubre who got us Chris Paul so *technically* we traded Ariza for Chris Paul
"To 7, up 3-2 and only lost bc of injured Chris Paul. Dame and CJ don’t compare"
I always felt the Packers gave up on Chris Paul too soon; I’m glad he found success elsewhere.
"Some famously injury prone players would be Blake, Chris Paul, Joel Embiid, AD, Cousins and Kristaps. Some others would be Bagley, Kevin Love, Marcus Smart, Gallinari, and Aaron Gordon."
"No because Chris Paul didn’t have possession of it. BOTH players have to have established contact for it to be a jump. Lowry knocking it out and Chris having no control means Chris can keep playing, but on the other hand Lowry NOT knocking it out and no having established contact long enough means Chris has to pass."
It's really not a hard call to make. Making the call that something WASN'T a travel in that kind of situation is the hard call. (IE: The Chris Paul non-travel last year against the Raptors that someone linked)
"Omg imagine thinking Chris Paul wasn't washed in 2019, everyone watching NBA knew CP3 was washed. I'm glad he was able to resurface in OKC"
PG: Penny Hardaway SG: Tracy McGrady SF: Paul Pierce PF: Barkley C: Chris Webber... just realized they’re all similar players fuck
"In his last year with Houston Chris Paul was washed, do you even watch Basketball? When he went to OKC he resurged but in Houston he was washed."
Blake by that point hadn’t made an all star team in 2 years + they had just traded Chris Paul to Houston. That era of Clippers basketball was over despite the mock jersey retirement. The Wizards aren’t taking calls on Beal unless someone crazy comes up in the conversations. It certainly won’t be for Herro + Picks or Porter + Picks like everyone is speculating about right now. Beal is in DC for the foreseeable future
Yeah. I hate Chris Paul too.
"best handles in the league, aesthetically pleasing jumper, puts crazy spin on the ball around the rim to finish at wild angles.   his handles are pretty unique compared to other great dribblers as well. where someone like chris paul really has the ball on a string and seems to be in complete control at all times, kyrie often dribbles way further out in front of himself and seems like he's on the brink of losing it but never does. his handle being ""loose"" in that way just makes it look cooler and he's extremely creative with his dribble moves."
The hilarious part about how mad everyone is about this correct call is that [everyone was also mad](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ehesc3/highlight_chris_paul_with_the_apparently/) about the correct call being made in the opposite direction last year [when Chris Paul wasn't called for traveling \(or a jump ball\)](https://streamable.com/xzaqd) because (unlike Randle) he actually did lose control of the ball.  People like being angry at refs more than they like learning the rules.
I’m gonna guess Chris Paul
"A good example of this is Chris Paul. Point guards can't do much to influence the overall quality of the defense as individual players by comparison to wings and bigs, but it's not a coincidence that getting Chris Paul has improved multiple teams defense when there weren't massive overhauls in the other personnel.   Having someone with that level of understanding of the game who's an excellent communicator has a bigger impact than Chris Paul's individual defense."
"Strength definitely matters on both sides of the ball. Stronger defenders can jockey offensive players to where they want them to go, and stop them getting to their spots easily so you want to be strong as an offensive player to mitigate that. It allows players to fight through holds that happen off the ball. It also allows the offensive player to put their body between the defender and the ball, and ""post up"" so to speak (think John Stockton bringing the ball up the court). My point about being bullied though was a more general thing, as when you are undersized (or average) in height you need to make up for it with being stronger and vice versa.  Again he is average height for his position, so can't really just shoot over any defender, just half of them on average. He relies on his movement to get open and his quick release to get his shot off more than his height. This is the part that people should emulate when mirroring Curry's game, not just bombing from half court.   I understand why OP is saying what he is saying, and of course a lot of players should look to emulate Chris Paul. But it is a lot easier said than done, and some players just don't have the IQ to run a team and make plays. If you are say 6'1 but a poor playmaker, but a great scorer coming up, then it would be very detrimental to your career to try to force yourself into this role that you just are not cut out for. The reason for that is an undersized player is going to struggle to make the league if they do not have at least 1 skill at a high level, so if a player is trying to force themselves to be a playmaker, then they had better be excellent at it. If they focus on their natural scoring ability the odds of success go up. Players shouldn't paint themselves into a corner early in their career, especially when it is not something they are particularly skilled at."
"I honestly don't care what set of rules they go with, I just want it applied evenly. Watching some players scream in a refs face while another player can get Td up just for looking at a ref is insane.  Then there is defense with guys like Chris Paul making a career out of fouling so much the refs stop calling it, or the way defense is played against Steph Curry versus most other players in the league."
Chris Paul is the best leader in the nba - chuck
It isnt even close.......when you got chris paul in the league lololol
Two words: Chris. Paul.
"Hell nah, Chris Paul made those guys much better than they were, they were called lob city for a reason. It wouldn’t be the same with kyrie since he isn’t a good playmaker and has shown to be a terrible leader."
The bubble play definitely helps this case. Only team to go undefeated and against those western conference teams. I’m also a huge Charles Barkley and Chris Paul fan so I’m hoping the Suns go deep.
"Then trade his ass, this is Chris fucking Paul were talking about not Kyle Lowry"
Meant in terms of salary. Next year Chris paul gets paid a whopping 44mill
"The Suns didn’t bring in Chris Paul to compete for a championship c’mon now. He isn’t supposed to be some long-term running mate for Booker. Even with Chris Paul we aren’t the favorites in the East, it’s still pretty comfortably the Nets"
"Imo CP better and I would take CP over Kyree to build a team. Chris Paul brings other things that stats don't always count. One of them being leadership. CP has proven since leaving Clippers that he is the voice, style of play, and brings structure and winning. Kyree did the opposite of those words in BOS. He could not round up his dudes in BOS, brought prissy attitude and complaints, and is only good for iso scoring. Also there are so many players to win championchips and multiple at that (Steve Kerr), as they say luck is a big part of winning rings. CP &gt; Kyree"
"Chris Paul is better than Middleton but he’s also 6 years older. Ya’ll gotta realize that CP3 is damn near 10 years older than Giannis, he doesn’t fit the timeline at all"
*Championships can only go so far especially when you're not the lead guy. Chris Paul has more accolades than Kyrie.
I don't think anything will. Chris Paul is just straight up the better player
"There's room to say Kyrie is underrated, but he's not better than Chris Paul lol."
"If his prime didn’t happen to line up perfectly with the “1st prime” of a top 2 player all-time, he’d have won multiple MVP’s.  This is why I don’t think it’s fair to compare Nash’s 2 MVP’s to Cp3’s zero. Chris paul was drafted as Lebron was averaging 31.4/7/6.6."
Steph Curry   Chris Paul   Nikola Jokic
"Hmmmmmmmmm....    Scott Foster you say?   You mean the same Scott Foster who’s best friend is Tim Donaghy, or the same Scott Foster who talked to Donaghy EVERY single day.... or is it Scott Foster who went up to Chris Paul before game 7 of a playoff series and said you know I’ve been here before with you.... hmmmm.   It’s like.... the NBA... empowers this guy, or in particular guys (refs), it’s like they can have an inside company man on the court at all times.... Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm     WHISTLEBLOWER PODCAST      MAYBE THIS SUB WILL STOP BITCHING AND WHINNING ABOUT THE SQUARED CIRCLE THAT IS THE NBA COURT AND REALIZE     WWE 🤝🤝🤝 NBA    Same fucking thing... but yeah continue to hold onto that the nba isn’t rigged... every day the refs prove it sooo and this sub just wants to throw up its arms and complain.... they don’t give a fuck. It’s the way the game works."
&gt;Chris Paul a close second because he’s just not a top scorer which doesn’t translate to championships.  dumb as all hell
"I think Chris Paul is one of the most underrated players lol everywhere he goes they get significantly better. The Thunder were trying to tank and he got them to the playoffs as like a 5 seed (I think it was 5, could be wrong)"
"Last year it was Doncic but I think people have properly rated him this year (and he got better at shooting the three). I think it is currently JJJ, people don't realize just how bad he is at rebounding (worse rebounding than Chris Paul last year) and also people don't realize how bad he is at fouling."
I don’t disagree with your statement I’m just saying Chris Paul isn’t a guy I’d put over Tatum.
"In no particular order:  1.	Lebron 2.	KD 3.	Harden 4.	Kawhi 5.	Giannis 6.	Anthony Davis 7.	Joel Embid 8.	Steph Curry 9.	Damian Lillard 10. Nikola Jokic 11. Paul George 12. Chris Paul 13. Luka Doncic 14. Kyrie Irving 15. Bradley Beal  Not sure if I missed anyone, but are all better and most are a tier above Tatum. Tatum is solidly in 16-20."
"honestly man, if it's any Sun, it's Devin Booker. lol He's awesome, but he's not on, like, Bradley Beal's level, much less a full blown superstar. I think he's good enough to be a leading scorer ona. championship team, I just think there's a good reason the team got better this year and it's a combination of Mikal Bridges, Chris Paul, and the addition of Jae Crowder. Chris Paul is a basketball genius, I don't care if he's only averaging 16 a game; hes influencing the game more than a lot of 25 ppg guys."
I’m just saying Prime Chris Paul very well could do it

"I didn't say anything about influence.  but I just disagree about Booker.  he's much like Jamal Murray.  Sometimes he looks like an absolute badass and other times he's pedestrian af.  Booker is not better than Chris Paul, either.."
"&gt; how about you worry more about an actual point guards duties like passing and setting up the team  Steph Curry wouldn't be half the player he is if he was forced into that role because he is a ""point guard"". Obviously Sexton is no where near that level, but you can't just ""one size fits all players"". Everyone is good at different stuff.  Remember too, Chris Paul is generational in his defence ability and vision, especially at his height. Trying to play like him isn't going to work out for the huge majority of players. Most undersized play makers won't be able to defend half as well, have no where near the passing and vision needed to stay in the league for more than like 3 years."
"Go watch chris paul in mis matches. Yea, if it's truly one on one he's not gonna stop him. But cp3 will do enough to bother him until a double comes. Go watch him"
"CP3's and Book's importance on this team are so close that I would struggle to claim to any certainty that either are *definitely* the best player on the team. Book is obviously the ultra efficient, high volume scorer and the go-to option to take the final shot when any game is on the line while CP3's impact on the game extends well beyond any measurable number. They fill two completely different roles on this team that have both been absolutely essential to its success. At least in terms of their importance to this Suns team, neither of them are *definitely* better than the other this season alone.  With that said, Chris Paul has been a godsend to this organization. We're so fortunate to have him."
"You might be watching, but that doesn't mean you know what you're seeing.   Chris Paul is definitely the best player on the Suns."
/u/chris-paul-overrated   I am sorry for doubting your claim
"He’s a shady asshole, knows he’s a shady asshole, and embraces it.   CP3 said he taunted him before a playoff game and I believe him: https://www.google.com/amp/s/thespun.com/nba/oklahoma-city-thunder/chris-paul-reveals-what-nba-referee-told-him-before-game-7/amp"
&gt; Chris Paul says referee Scott Foster made a point to tell him before the Game 7 loss to the Thunder tonight that he also reffed his Game 7 loss to the Spurs in 2008 when CP was with the Hornets.  Yeah he’s a massive asshole.
"I could be completely wrong but I the Chris Paul situation the contact with the ball is in the air leading me to think only 2 possible outcomes: no loss of control = jump ball or loss of control = play on.  This one is a tad different as to me it appears that the contact with the ball is prior to his jump. If that's the case, I think  it can't be a jump ball or every time a defender even touches a ball for a second it would be a jump ball... could be wrong here. Randle was definitely about to jump and that might change things but I honestly can't find anything about it. He then jumps,  no additional contact with ball, and then lands without any apparent loss of control.  That makes me believe that this is indeed a travel.  Though even if this is the case, I believe the refs should have at least reviewed the play. I might even be wrong the contact occurred prior to the jump because it's pretty close."
Man I’m so tired of these Chris Paul State Farm ads
Chris Paul for the All NBA spot.
Now do Chris Paul
I think this guy said he watched Chris Paul once and he had a bad game that night. And now thinks Paul is overrated and not a MVP candidate or top 15/20 player or something. So he took that name.
The Last Two Minute Report will say this was the correct call because Randle never lost control and Kyrie never had simultaneous possession.  The hilarious part about how mad everyone is about this correct call is that [everyone was also mad](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ehesc3/highlight_chris_paul_with_the_apparently/) about the correct call being made last year [when Chris Paul wasn't called for traveling \(or a jump ball\)](https://streamable.com/xzaqd) because (unlike Randle) he actually did lose control of the ball.

"Bruh what, this is just false. Kidd was a career 55% 0-3 feet, while Paul was a career 62%. Even accounting for time period, Paul was a superior finisher. Overall, Chris Paul is in a different stratosphere scoring wise which gives him the definite edge over Kidd."
"I still love Chris Paul, even if he disagrees"
Kobe had a shorter wingspan and during his offensive peak his springiness had sapped so was not as vertical a presence as he was in his younger years.  MJ averaged so many steals due to a compacted court. If you spread it out more he would struggle to get as many steals and would get burned more which is now why more Conservative defensive players are better. Don't get me wrong he is a great defender but those numbers are inflated which is why Chris Paul arguably a top 3 guard at getting steals all time behind Stockton and Payton has not been close to Jordans peak in terms of steals.   MJ was a great defender sure but he definitely didn't deserve his DPOY at least compared to a lot of guys who never got it and were definitely in the tier above when it comes to defence to me. Just 2 players I'm going to make a quick example of Pippen and Duncan although I'm sure there are a lot more players.  I think smart provides as much value on Defence as any guard ever except Payton. He has been the key to bostons defence since his rookie season. He is the reason why they have successfully managed to hide 3 liabilities on Defence in the postseason. He can battle bigs and is great against wings. Draws fouls in the clutch in a way no one else has ever matched. He is probably the player best able to stay attached to players in isolation or through screens or off ball. To me he is the 3rd best defender in the nba behind Gobert and Green and slightly ahead of Simmons and Kawhi.
PG: Chris Paul  SG: JR Smith  SF: Zion Williamson  PF: David West  C: Anthony Davis  I had to do a little positional flexibility
"Harden, Kyrie, Chris Paul"
"Best leader in the nba? How? What puts him over guys like lebron, Chris Paul, draymond, or Butler as a leader"
Dwayne Wade is already following in the footsteps of Paul Pierce and Chris Webber as an analyst of the game
Ye it was a pop Westbrook. Jimmy and Chris Paul don't have eye popping stats but they do winning plays. Lebron does both tho.
"Unless any of the candidates go off I can't see any of them as the surefire MVP  We had like 12 this season, the following players imo qualify or are at least honorable mentions, no order   James Harden  Kevin Durant (Nets success without him hurts his case allot more then everyone else tho)   LeBron James  Nikola Jokic  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Jimmy Butler  Joel Embiid   Giannis Antete-pretend-I-spelled-it-right-kumpo  Kawhi Leonard  Chris Paul  Luka Doncic  With all due respect Gobert ain't cut it, the Jazz are a 2014 spurs clone to me, as in the whole team is good, just that Mitchell is inconsistent as fuck"
"I may be reading too much in to this.. But the whole triple double mention and Chris Paul makes me think you're taking a pop at Westbrooks thunder days? Or just triple doubles? I don't understand..Chris Paul was a fucking genius on the floor for the Thunder, the whole thing clicked, it was amazing to watch a team that everyone had wrote off do what they did. Did I also enjoy the triple double average seasons? Yessir."
"A team with James Harden and Chris Paul was the only possible combination of players that could get more people to root for the Warriors instead of against them, that’s honestly an achievement in itself"
I bet Chris Paul would disagree with that.
"Chris Paul being injured doesnt change anything about what I said. They didn’t have good offense targeting Steph, and they were winning games because of their own defense, not their offense."
The new chris paul inspired him
The amount of fans from different teams saying they didn’t want to trade for Chris Paul this past offseason was insane. He’s a born winner whether he’s got a ring or not
"James harden- Doesn't matter what anyone says. You can put him on a team full of bums and I'll be like, ""Yeah, he's taking them to the playoffs."" Plus him rarely being injured/out for games makes him so valuable imo. Nowadays it so common for stars to be missing games constantly, that its actually nice to have someone as durable as him on your team.   Chris paul- helping the suns grab a top seed in the west this years just shows how big of a difference a traditional point guard can still have on a team. Although he's getting up there in age after the suns if he willing to take a back seat and help mentor a young high draft pick point guard....I'll throw him some cash."
"I was curious who the 17 are:  LeBron James (LAL)  Anthony Davis (LAL)  Giannis antentekuonmpo (MIL)  Luka Doncic (DAL)  James Harden (BKN)  Steph Curry (GSW)  Paul George (LAC)  Nikola Jokic (DEN)  Damian Lillard (POR)  Kevin Durant (BKN)  Russel Westbrook (WSH)  kawhi Leonard (LAC)  DeAndre Jordan (BKN)  Marc Gasol (LAL)  Chris Paul (PHX)  Dwight Howard (PHI)  Derrick Rose (NYK)  So 3 Lakers, 3 nets, 2 clippers and a Knick."
Chris Paul too. They've both shown it's not just triple doubles that give wins
"Chris Paul, Steph Curry, and Lonzo Ball."
Chris Paul
"I would take Giannis and Harden all time over Kawhi, and neither are top 20-25. So no.  It's like putting Chauncey Billups over Chris Paul all time cause he got FMVP and a chip. Sustained excellence and multiple MVPs is more important than a FMVP."
"Dray has better IQ, but Simmons is the better individual defender. Dray is kinda like Chris Paul , he makes the whole team play better on that end on top of his individual excelence"
"&gt; Uh, literally 2018? The cavs sucked ass and everyone knew the WCF were the finals. Up 3-2 and Chris Paul gets injured and golden state wins in a bail out.  I know Texas education isn't up to par but even you should be able to comprehend 'game 7 in the NBA Finals'  &gt;Because the rockets weren’t good enough in 2017 lmao. And shit the bed? The fuck? He was the only one even trying, we were the 8th seed 41-41.  Is that the excuse for losing to the Kwahi-less Spurs? I'm embarrassed for you right now. Rockets were by far the better team yet Harden's trash ass decided to set an NBA turnover record instead of leading his team to the WCF."
"Uh, literally 2018? The cavs sucked ass and everyone knew the WCF were the finals. Up 3-2 and Chris Paul gets injured and golden state wins in a bail out.  Steph played **one** good game and 5 bad ones  Because the rockets weren’t good enough in 2017 lmao. And shit the bed? The fuck? He was the only one even trying, we were the 8th seed 41-41. In 2018 we were good enough and you got bailed out   Hope Steph enjoys the lottery tho"
Lol steph averaged 23 on 53% TS in the 2019 series and harden put up 35 on 60% TS. One guy got bailed by KD the other had Chris Paul struggling
"Even though 3&gt;2, a sweet midrange game is still the most beautiful thing in basketball. I love watching demar derozan, KD, Chris Paul great midrange players. Shaun Livingston was really nice too, and Harden before he played Moreyball"
"Lol check out what Chris Paul did from games 1-5 of the 2019 series. Harden did all he could, stupid as fuck to blame the guy who averaged 35 on 60% ts"
2018 Rockets if they had Chris Paul for game 7

His dunks are too good and he's an elite put-back player. Just nice guy to have on the team.   I made sure to have a playmaker, a shooter, and an elite defender at each position so that the team can essentially play any playstyle and succeed. Can use dominant post-man, traditional ball movement, heliocentric offensive-creator etc. Could even go with a twin towers lineup by sliding AD to the 4."
And if Chris Paul literally plays game 7 hardens a champion and likely fmvp
Chris Paul because of literally everything about him
i was about to say something until i saw “replying to Chris-Paul-Overrated” above my message
Chris Paul on the court. Got to show up now.
*playing against chris paul rondo
Kyrie was a hyped up prospect for years. College was just a formality for him. I remember watching highlight videos calling him the next Chris Paul when he was in 8th grade lmao.
Dennis Schroder fooled us all. It was all because of Chris Paul and SGA in OKC last season.
Chris Paul did that exact move tons of times last year for y’all btw
People on here switched up on Chris Paul so hard last year they’ve literally forgotten everything they said they hated about him
Dennis with the chris paul move
Wtf dude no it's not. Cliff Paul is Chris Paul's twin brother stop messing around
"&gt;2 words: Chris Paul, Point God ~~Guard Extraordinaire, Man Among Men and Defender of the Realm~~"
"For sure... three biggest blemishes on Stern imo is the Chris Paul saga, moving the Sonics, and forcing a dress code (although the last one you could say did eventually turn out to be the right move despite the racist undertones)"
It’s green screen. State Farm puts Chris Paul and Cliff Paul (Chris Paul in makeup) in different sets
Wym? He doesn’t have one.  Cliff Paul is just Chris Paul in makeup.
Chris Paul doesn’t actually have a twin
"Cliff Paul is just Chris Paul with glasses and a mustache, you know that right?"
"The rankings:   **DPOY:**  1. Ben Simmons 2. Rudy Gobert 3. Bam Adebayo  **MVP:**   1. Nikola Jokic 2. Damian Lillard 3. Giannis Antetokounmpo 4. Joel Embiid 5.

"Yes. The one criticism of the jazz for playoff series, is that they don’t have another elite creator. Chris Paul would solve that problem."
And Chris Paul called Booker a two way player. These idiots just don't want to admit they were wrong about Booker so they do everything to discredit him.
"He clearly is. And the team has adapted his playing style. That is why they are winning, because Paul impacts so many more possessions.      10th in pace last year, 26th this year. Methodical about their offensive possessions, super disciplined on defense. This is a Chris Paul led team, even if Booker scores more points.      Look at impact stats. Watch the games. The answer is pretty clear."
Chris Paul is never a bad move for anyone except for those who trade him. :(
"Haha ok.  I didn't say this to shit on Chris Paul.  I just said Nash has a better resume.  If you think 2 more All-NBAs and all defense make up for the extra MVPs and playoff success, it's fine.  It might be debatable, but I still think it's weird to say CPs a lock and Nash is questionable."
Chris Paul won multiple playoff series as the man. Westbrook never won a single one.
"That was his second season. Even as a rookie in his first season he had a higher USG% than pretty much any PG ever including any year of Steve Nash, Chris Paul, Magic Johnson, John Stockton. His insane volume stats have something to do with how guards play basketball these days taking a ton of shots and getting a ton of ""Russel Westbrook style"" uncontested rebounds. Not to mention the much faster pace of play these days which also increases total volume stats. I think in the future there is a chance we see more and more guards average these really high stats."
"Haven't watched many Suns games this year, but while Chris Paul played great, Ayton is the guy who beat us last night. That man is a fucking beast on the boards."
"Literally what I point out any time someone tries to tell me Billy D was a good coach by pointing to that season.  Chris Paul doesn’t get the credit he deserves sometimes. The teams he’s been on are clearly worse after he leaves, and the ones he was on are clear better when he arrives. Every time."
Chris Paul was 32 and Dwight was 28
"Devin Booker is averaging 26.1/4.1/4.5 on .495/.359/.857 splits, .598 TS%, 3.3 TOV/g and playing 34.1 MPG.  Chris Paul is averaging 16.3/4.7/8.8 on .493/.372/.926 splits, .592 TS%, 2.3 TOV/g and playing 32 MPG.  Considering the leadership and defense that CP3 brings, I'd say there's a good case for CP3 as the Sun's best player this year. And the Suns are pretty deep; Bridges, Ayton, Crowder, etc are all contributing really well to the team. It's not like Booker is carrying this team on his back like Jokic, Giannis and LeBron have been with their teams.  This is why Booker isn't in the MVP race."
"And they probably don't make the playoffs without Chris Paul.  Timberwolves also look good on paper with talented players and veterans and yet they are bottom feeders. The experience and leadership that CP3 provides can't be matches by Booker, at least at this point of his career"
"It depends on what you want. Booker is amazing in the midrange, and pretty good from 3. Donovan is pretty good in midrange, but very good from three. And both have a talent at getting to the rim.  Both are very important in each teams respective teams. I think Chris Paul is perfect with book cuz he helps him find open looks.   Rudy is really good with Donovan in the pick n roll and helps suck in the defense.   Both guys are flourishing in their systems and it’s becoming really hard to compare/say who is better"
"During the course of the last decade on Reddit, I would wager that Chris Paul is the most underrated and underappreciated player on this sub."
Most talking heads don't know a whole lot more about most teams than the average NBA fan. They know Chris Paul came to the team because that made headlines. They also know the Suns are good now. It's lazy as hell but that's about all the thought that goes into it for them.
"Some players like Chris Paul are predominantly multiplier players. Others like Kyrie (and probably Booker at this point in his career) are excellent additive players.   Every now and then you get a Lebron James, Michael Jordan who are damn good at both and can single handedly carry team. In my eyes 2021 James Harden or Nicholas Jokic come close too.  Chris Paul is probably the best multiplier in the game even as he ages. However no doubt if he didn't already have excellent teammates like Booker to help multiply, theres no way the sun's will be doing so well. To me it's just a great media narrative around a redemption arc that happens to be the perfect piece to unlock potential."
"I think the closest is James Harden, who played with MVPs Westbrook and Durant, former top 3 MVP finisher Dwight Howard, and former top 2 MVP finisher Chris Paul"
"Its not that simple. What you saw in the bubble was what this team was without cp3. Before the bubble we had lots of injuries, an ayton suspension, and at least three young high minutes players in cam johnson, mikal, and Ayton who were all still playing not to their best ability. They all stepped up in the bubble and continued it into this season. Not to mention that before the bubble we didnt have a backup pg. cam payne has been huge for our team and he wasnt even on the team before the bubble. Chris paul took an A- team to an A+ team but to give him the credit from C- to A- is just plain wrong"
Chris Paul is a Gauud on this sub. If you say anything negative about him you will be downvotes into oblivion!
The 2018 Houston Rockets went 50-5 when their 3 best player were healthy.      They also had James Harden and Chris Paul...
"He signed his 2nd contract in 2017 after they got Chris Paul, not 2017"
"yes, in the playoffs give me chris paul over mike conley"
LaVine before this season   28% for his career from 3-10 ft   30% from 10-16 ft  36% from 16-22 ft   48% on 2 pointers in general   A guy like this isnt suddenly going to become Chris Paul or Kevin Durant from this range like his %s were at a point earlier this year. Regression was inevitable.
&gt; Chris Paul is old as shit and isn't even much better than Rubio and Oubre combined  ice cold
"“This shit is so dumb and I hate hearing it. Chris Paul is an obvious upgrade over Rubio, but it's a marginal improvement and ruins any sort of flexibility in the future. Also, the team needs depth. The starting 5 is fine and I would rather bank on improvement there while building the bench.”"
"Just wait for the outrage when people realize that 4 of Donovan Mitchell, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Kyrie Irving, Zach LaVine and Bradley Beal wont even make an All NBA team this year. Have no idea which 2 even should of that group"
"This discussion is why assists isn’t always a great measure of how good a playmaker a player is. That bucket is technically unassisted and nothing shows up on the stat sheet for Steph. But it’s inarguable that he created that bucket as much as if he had made a pass to a cutter. Steph’s assists always come in low compared to heavy on ball guys like Westbrook, Chris Paul, and Lebron, but unlike those guys he’s able to create incredible shot opportunities by moving off the ball and using his positioning on the floor to open up lanes and shooters. He’s every bit as good of a playmaker as any of those guys.  Basically we talk so much about his gravity, but it’s Steph’s dedicated weaponization of that gravity that makes him have those all time great offensive impact stats."
"&gt;but Chris Paul  is arguably top 5 PG ever  If Chris Paul is arguably Top 5 PG ever then so is Nash, they're not that far on any All Time list, lol. Defensively its not close Paul was better in that aspect, but I think you're forgetting that Paul has an almost non-existent Playoff career, like what has he accomplished in the Playoffs? Nash at least proved that at his peak he could lead a team to the WCF as the best player."
"I strongly agree but it's not worth the arguments on here. Everyone just says ""you didn't watch him"" or ""you only care about advanced stats,"" as you can see here.  I watched him a FUCKTON in his prime. I'm in my mid 30s and the Iverson era was my prime watching years, and my entire life has been split living outside of Philadelphia and Boston (division rival).  The dude knew how to score and was fearless in the lane, but he comes with too many negatives. I value players that elevate their team and are able to adapt. Iverson is one of the least adaptable stars out there. The old floor-raiser vs. ceiling-raiser debate. You have to build your team around all of his weaknesses, both on offense and on defense. He's super undersized, poor defensively (yes, I know he got lots of steals), and a high-usage scorer, so basically HAVE to pair him with a low-usage, larger, defensive-minded PG in the backcourt. The entire roster needs to be tailored around what's best for Iverson, instead of other guards like Reggie Miller or Chris Paul or John Stockton who would fit into any roster you put them in.    An amazing talent with astounding durability/stamina and one of the biggest ""hearts"" out there... but absolutely overrated. I don't think he's top 50 all-time, or if he is then it's pretty close to 50. People love the attitude and love the volume scoring though, I get it."
"Normally I'd say he should be taken out of the game at that point, it's Chris Paul and he kind of deserves it especially in this situation."
"Imagine Joe Johnson and al Horford with young Chris Paul, that’s an ECF team competing with Boston, Cleveland, Detroit and Orlando in the late 2000’s"
"Chris Paul, Wade, Melo, and Lebron all go beaching together and this sub wants to get mad at new guys for being “soft” because nobody responds to Draymond’s barks like he wants them to."
I'm pretty sure they are one Chris Paul away from being competitive
"Gotta feel bad for the Kings. They haven't finished a season over .500 since 2006.  For clarification, that was LeBron's first year in the playoffs.   Chris Paul, Derron Williams, and Andrew Bogut made the All-Rookie team that year.   Clifford Robinson and Kevin Willis were still kicking around.   LaMarcus Aldridge, Kyle Lowry, and J. J. Reddick weren't even in the league at that time.   Al Horford and Joakim Noah were teammates in college. Kevin Durant was a year away from declaring for the draft.   Derrick Rose was still in high school.   Blake Griffin was 5 years away from playing his first NBA game.   Antony Davis was still in GRADE school.   Luka would have been in the second grade!  LaMelo Ball would have been in pre-school.  &amp;#x200B;  THAT'S how long it has been since the Kings were over .500.   &amp;#x200B;  :-("
"They passed on Deron Williams also. He may not have been a Chris Paul, but he was a top 5 PG for a couple years and would have been a huge addition to Horford and Iso Joe."
I still can’t we got additional assets to take on Chris Paul.
"It feels like Chris Paul is playing better than ever this year. His game is aging really well.  Donovan Mitchell at -11 also surprised me, but he wasn't getting the support he needed on offense. The Jazz are missing a second strong scorer on their team, which makes me skeptical that they'll be able to handle the Playoffs this year."
Plenty of folks hate Chris Paul too though.
I mean the PAST year should matter....dont tell me that if the jazz/suns see the lakers first round they arent gonna be pissing in their pants   also besides chris paul the suns have legitimately no playoff experience so that will be interesting to see. I believe the lakers/clippers to be the favourites as jazz/suns have bad matchups with them.
"The players you have around you make a HUGE difference.   In Detroit, it wasn't like Blake had snipers spreading the defense and a guy like Chris Paul setting up beautiful lob.   In addition, he wasn't the healthiest guy.   He dunked plenty his first season in Detroit. He was a show stopper and made a below average team worth watching.   He had what is arguably his best individual season in Detroit (24/7.5/5.4).  But then 2019 happened.  Out most of the season.   And this year, when the season started, it was clear the front office wasn't interested in fielding a competitive team, and had Blake on the block from the get.   Blake doesn't have many years in front of him, so risking injury for a team designed to lose when he knows he'll likely get bought out and have what may be his last chance to win a title just doesn't make sense.   And he's got cred in Detroit.  That first year, even though we were on the way to getting swept, he still played hurt in the playoffs.    I know he has a reputation for being an asshole off the court, but as a Detroit fan, I appreciate the positive attitude he brought in, and I understand the underwhelming performance we got from him at the start of the season."
"In your opinion, does every team that has ever failed to win a championship set the rule that their best player isn’t good enough to lead a team to a championship? Is it wrong to chalk any of that up to the supporting cast, or team chemistry?   Why could Lebron never win a ring in Cleveland until he came back and they had a better team surrounding him? Is Charles Barkley not good enough to lead a team to a ring? Prime Chris Paul? John Stockton? Karl Malone? Can you honestly tell me with complete certainty that none of these people are good enough to lead a team to a championship? Because in my opinion you’d be dead wrong and the vast majority would agree with me.   Your very best player is less important than your supporting cast. You can have one superstar, a generational talent, but they’re never going to be able to win without an outstanding supporting cast. And every single championship winning team of the past decade (and longer than that) had a better supporting cast than harden did in Houston. I’m not a Harden Stan but to say that because Houston didn’t work out means he couldn’t be the best player on a championship winning team seems so ridiculous to me.   I know some people will scream at the thought of this, but harden is arguably the best player on a championship contending team right now. Of the big three he’s the most efficient in terms of total points generated, and he’s also the best rebounder. He has a serious case for being their best player. So we will see how they do."
After the season he had with the thunder and now the suns chris Paul needs a ring frfr
"Spoken like a true spreadsheet basketball player.  It doesn't take a genius to see that CP3 is an all time PG.Nash was fantastic and he is often underrated, but Chris Paul  is arguably top 5 PG ever  P.S. you conveniently ignored defence"
"That’s true, but Curry arguably had his best game against Chris Paul in Game 3."
Chris Paul tricked y’all man
He's been doing that for a while. [This is from February](https://arizonasports.com/story/2552176/phoenix-suns-pg-chris-paul-drinks-from-bottle-labeled-secret-stuff/).
"I think Chris Paul is quite a bit better than Nash, Nash is deserving of those MVPs but it's no like Paul hasn't finished high in many different MVP races."
The Chris Paul effect.
"Yup. Even as a high volume player at full health in 2019, Griffin only had 37 dunks, because he was shouldering the Pistons' entire offense from the high post and perimeter all season (and did an incredible job, hence the All-NBA Third Team honor).   Blake couldn't play off of guys like Chris Paul, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, or Kevin Durant in Detroit. Instead, we kind of needed and expected him to be all of those dudes on his own."
"Chris Paul HAS to be an MVP candidate. IMO, the MVP is a 2 man race between him and the Joker. What CP3 is doing in Phoenix is wild. Excited to see what he does in the playoffs, as long as he doesn’t go up against my Jazz."
"He's reached the point of his career of not giving a fuck anymore, what they gonna do? Backtalk Fucking Chris Paul??"

"Can’t let Chris Paul play with older Kobe, but we can let the Heat have 3 top 12 players. I know the NBA were running the team but still annoying."
Chris Paul can’t even say nothing cause he knows that moves straight from page 1 of the CP3 playbook
He should be.  Ive watched every game in the last 5 years due to league pass and most games prior to that... And Chris Paul has the Steve Nash effect on this team.. Just like he did for Clippers and Pelicans and other teams.  He's the reason why Suns are a top team.   If either him or Booker are off the team... The Suns would be worse if it's Paul who's out. Booker is an elite star scorer but he doesn't make the team go... He's a one man scoring machine... Chris Paul is a floor general.. A super star floor General.
The Chris Paul effect
"I wonder this myself. But the question is just to the voters. Their decision.  2012 - injured  2013 - he was a good first option and co-lead playmaker in the good Warriors team. He played really well. He was in the discussion for third team, but there was no big event to push him over the established stars. First team was Chris Paul, who had a great season on both ends so easy choice, and Kobe, because obviously, he's Kobe.  2014 - this season it was pretty much accepted Curry is something else, but also there is a lot of competition on the guard positions. Chris Paul again is an obvious choice as a leader, defender, point god etc., and Curry lost the first team All-NBA by a few votes to Harden. Why? Good question. Hard to say. Harden had a bit more points per game (a bit more minutes) and Rockets had a bit better record.  2017, 18 - Durant came and that kinda put the perceived ""value"" of Curry in the NBA culture down a lot. Nothing is more influential to the awards than being the only star in your team and GSW was now a team with Kevin Durant. That's it, he was playing just as good individually.  2020 - injured again  2021- yeah look around. The Warriors are too weak, when they were a few games above .500 Curry seemed a favorite for the first team All-NBA."
"What people don't realise/forget about the Warren trade is that the Suns didn't want to take *any* salary back. This part is hugely important, because straight away it limited the amount of potential trade partners. Firstly, the Suns had to find a team more than $10 million under the cap so that they could absorb Warren's entire contract. Secondly, of these limited teams, they were trading them a win-now player. There were only 6 or so teams at the time the Suns could trade with. This list included teams like the Knicks and Hawks, who had just come off losing seasons. The only win-now team with over $10 million of cap available that offseason? The Indiana Pacers.  They were betting against nobody, and rightfully made the Suns give THEM an asset to take Warren. The Suns' desperately needed the cap space to reshape their roster (having Oubre, Mikal, Cam Johnson and Warren all on the team, but no point guard), so they made the deal.  Moving Warren's contract gave the Suns the cap space to sign Rubio. If they didn't attach that pick, they wouldn't have gotten Rubio and Booker would have gone through ANOTHER season without a proper point guard. Ultimately, it worked out for the Suns because in the end we turned Ariza + Warren + a 2nd round pick to get Chris Paul."
What had Chris Paul done as a first option? But as a second option his reach the conference finals whilst Westbrook reached the finals comfortably
We still have Chris Paul and Rondo lololol
"A few months ago Nick Wright was saying there's only 4 players that can guarantee a playoff berth: Lebron, KD, Kawhi and James Harden. Chris Paul is also a guaranteed playoff berth too imo."
"Hmm I’m curious, I’m a big Russ fan, but does he make the top 10? Let’s see... I like:  Magic Johnson Steph Curry John Stockton Oscar Robertson Chris Paul Isiah Thomas   ... clearly above Russ, but that’s it tbh. After that it becomes preference and a bit of a grey area. At that point we get into the Steve Nash, Walt Frazier, Jason Kidd conversation, and I personally think Russ is equal/better than these guys. Kind of shocking to say, but upon my analysis, I would agree, Russell Westbrook is a top 10 all-time point guard.  Huh"
Chris Paul is just insane
"That guys dumb, series would be a toss up, no way nuggets win in 5  Chris Paul will make Jokic look foolish"
"Jason Kidd and especially Chris Paul are better than Stockton. Also, CP3 is top 5, arguably top 3."
Why isn’t Chris Paul in mvp convos
Very Chris Paul type move by Gobert 😂
"Chris Paul, courage the cowardly dog, Ed, edd, and eddy"
Chris Paul is lowkey one of the funniest players in the league
Chris “Juan Manuel Marquez” Paul
Chris Paul I guess hasn’t forgiven the Jazz ever since that 2017 series. He always goes god mode against the Jazz
[10 things Chris Paul can't live without ](https://youtu.be/8aNHJS7taiI)  He explains in the linked video. Start at 4:05 It has sentimental value as it's a combination of his family's star signs
There’s a Space Jam 2 that’s being released only in Azerbaijan where instead of LeBron it’s Chris Paul and it takes place in the Cartoon Network universe
That’s the most Chris Paul shit ever
"But seriously yes.   I’ve watched every suns game the last 3 years. I watched the suns be a shit stain of the NBA. A complete dumpster fire would be a compliment.   The Suns are a top team. With back to back Ws against the nuggets and jazz, 2-0 vs the leagues top team (for now), Ws against the Bucks, the 76ers, the Blazers, and the leagues best road record, an 8-0 bubble record, AND FRANK FUCKING KAMINSKY?   of course they are contenders.   Devin Booker has been embarrassing every single fucking defense this year with midrange mastery.  Chris Paul is State Farm.   Mikal Bridges puts the clamps on the opposing teams star day in and day out.   Luka Doncic is 1-7 vs. Deandre Ayton.   As an AZ sports fan, the real test comes in the playoffs where AZ sports always fall short, unless it’s the Phoenix Mercury or 2001 diamondbacks.   You’re god damn right we’re contenders."
"100% CP3. Harden is a better scorer, no doubt, but what Chris Paul brings to a team is so multifaceted. Dude is an absolute leader who sees the game like chess and always thinks multiple moves ahead. He makes everyone around him better. I won’t be surprised if the Suns sneak in and steal this one with him running the show."
"I got two words for you. Devin Booker and Chris Paul, must see TV"
Chris Paul is probably the 3rd best point guard to never win a ring.
"Im so happy the Suns are good again. One of the beat fan bases in the league too, would love to see them make a deep playoff run. Chris Paul is just so damn good."
Why would KD win it over CP3 if Clippers had the best record in the league also led by a historic season by Chris Paul?
You can’t out-petty Chris Paul
"Oh ya, I definitely know Chris Paul’s history. Rudy Gobert lying on the floor and leaving the game momentarily after replays showed he barely got touched is 10x funnier than any of Chris Paul’s flops 😂😂  It was nearly Paul Pierce leaving the game after shitting himself level of funny"
Those advanced stats I think do think underrate Nash a heap (and also overrate CP3 to be honest). In 2005 they say he was less impactful than two of his own teammates (Stat and Marion). So I'll chuck another one in for fun that actually likes Nash&gt;CP3  RAPM:  Chris Paul 08-09 - 5.8  Steve Nash 06-07 - 6.3
"I 100% thought Chris Paul was a bad move for you guys, so happy that I was wrong."
Chris Paul was drafted 16 years ago and he's had a reputation for doing stuff like this pretty much the whole time. [He definitely has some stuff on that level...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcxXGPDC1Gs)
"Chris Paul- when he got traded here  I thought Russ would the same,  but I still don’t like him"
"Yeah, LeBron played for longer so of course he will break his records. Same reason Kareem, Tim Duncan, Kobe hold many records over MJ too.   At the end of the day, MJ achieved more than all those guys and LeBron in less time, which is more impressive imo. Same reason I would rank a guy like Chris Paul or Steve Nash over John Stockton all time."
I find it really suprising that everyone forgets Player Association and Chris Paul wanted this All Star. NBA management wasnt even insisting on it..
"Idk if I would necessarily label him as pass first (like a rondo, Chris Paul, Steve nash) but he’s definitely always willing to hit the open man if they have a shot. That’s probably my favorite thing about him. Even as good as his he’s still always a team first player that can take over an entire game if he so chooses to. But most of the time he’s trying to get his teammates going while still getting his own points."
A.K.A. he now has Chris Paul at his side
"Chris Paul can actually play in the post. He doesn’t back guys down, but he does hit the short baseline midrange, and he can face up. The only way he can do it is his lower body/core strength, but I do think it’s a great asset especially when these players start aging and losing their first step."
Chris Paul doesn’t really elevate anymore but he posts up
"You can’t brush it off as just a team accomplishment, unless you do the same when you’re discussing every player lol.  The Chris Paul Rockets were arguably a better team than the current Lakers"
"Probably not. He’s probably got the potential of a Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf type career if everything breaks right for him lol. Doesn’t really belong in the tier of the true point guard superstars like Kyrie, Chris Paul, John Wall, Westbrook, or even Rondo. You know, guys who actually can be and were the clear cut main star guys for title winning teams..."
"Two of the top 5 players in the league  They don’t compare to the KD Warriors, or prolly even the Chris Paul Rockets. But any team that has 2 top 5 players is a super team"
I like how the state farm commercial universe has progressed to the point that its just a Twilight Zone nightmare episode for Chris Paul
The new chris paul is actually my agent. Good guy
At the end of [this clip](https://streamable.com/tqdusn) you can see their Western picks. The standouts to me are that Chuck picked Jordan Clarkson over AD while Kenny picked Chris Paul over Donovan Mitchell.
"Lol yeah it was in writing to not have the allstar game as a compromise to start the season so early, and they would get that week off. But then Chris Paul and NBAPA agreed later to actually instead play the all star game so they could make the tv sponsors happy. But yeah fuck Adam silver and turner sports right?"
"&gt;Indeed. Luka won like 10 awards by the age o0f 18. Lilard at 30 is zero.   What, pre-NBA awards?  Dame's VORP is 4x Luka's, the best defense is a good offense, etc. That he doesn't defend at all is a tired meme anyway, he's not Chris Paul."
More player votes than Chris Paul is surprising.  It's crazy to see how much mainstream fans pay no attention to small markets.
Chris Paul and it’s not even really a discussion
"Chris Paul, Booker has been underwhelming this year to say the least."
"Dame, AD, Spyda, and PG13 look like locks for reserves. Zion will probably get in on hype alone (not to say he doesn't deserve a spot). Gobert should be in due to the Jazz record. 7th reserve spot is very much up in the air. You could make a case for Conley, Chris Paul, Ingram, Book, even Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. I'll go with Conley because 1) Jazz record and 2) he's put together a superb career without an All-Star selection yet."
"I mentioned the Jazz and the Lakers, and you you’re talking about the Suns.   They living rent free in your head for what?   I’m not talking about them, or how much better they are this season. Chris Paul improves every team he has ever been on, so their success isn’t all that surprising.  Clearly a bunch of bums? YOU said that, not me. You’re assuming some weird shit especially after  I said the Jazz are good but no one is betting on them against the Lakers, and you’re getting all offended."
Chris Paul
"Oh yeah for sure, I hate the narrative of LeBron carrying the bum Cavs every year to the playoffs, when it was a team he damn near hand-picked that would have dominated a league that didn’t have the Warriors, aside from maybe Houston with Chris Paul."
"He's washed and is still owed an average of $46ish million over each of the next two seasons. The only area of the floor he's a good scorer from is right at the basket and his percentage of shots attempted at the rim dipped from 41.5 last season to a Chris Paul-esque 14.7% this year. He even forgot how to shoot free throws again, as evidenced by the career worst 61.9%. It's just an ugly situation overall."
"So weird, one of the huge leverage points of restarting the season was that players wouldn’t have to play All Star weekend and they would get that week off.  But then Chris Paul and NBAPA agreed later to actually instead play the all star game so they could make the tv sponsors happy. And now Adam Silver’s to blame?"
"Lol he had one good stretch for like a month, and even then it was only because teams were commiting 2 guys to harden and leaving russ open. Russ took a million shots a game and had a 52% TS. It’s no secret our offense was worse the one season with him lmao, idc if you like russ that’s the truth.  Lol harden averaged 40 PPG for 3 months while Chris Paul, capella, and Gordon didn’t play. Yes, harden himself is a elite offense.  Jimmy is a better fit because he’s miles more efficient   The season is also far from over, miami could easily still finish top 5"
"Harden has won an MVP too lol and was robbed of a couple other ones. He’s made first team all nba like every season since 2015. Jokic isn’t a better passer then harden, Chris Paul was in his prime but not right now. Lebron is probably better yes but so was John Stockton during Magic’s days wasnt he? See how your argument flips so easily?  I never even fucking said he was equal to magic but you’re trying to undermine him lmfao.  Nobodies in there feelings, you’re just scared to admit harden impacts the game as much or even more then magic did so you’re resorting to acting like you’re too good to argue.  Nothing about this take is laughable, it’s easily defendable. The only thing laughable is how you keep pretending you can’t compare the two as if harden isn’t also way better at scoring lmao"
"&gt;Never heard of it  So what? How does your lack of knowledge negate my point?  &gt;This has nothing to do with buying hardware or operating systems.  What does Microsoft sell?  Why are they paying LeBron to be in their marketing materials?  This is not rocket science.  &gt;From 2010, he's been in how many commercials for State Farm since?  Again what is your point?  Now Chris Paul does the State Farm commercials.  Clearly State Farm believes there is value in having athletes who know nothing about insurance promote insurance.  &gt;Yeah because he's an athlete that travels constantly and is always around loud crowds of people.  LOL.  This is really hilarious.  On that basis.  LeBron is a peak athlete.  He knows more about his body than the average person.  Staying healthy is hugely important to his career.  Therefore, people should trust his decision about his health and take the vaccine.  There is a greater case for trusting LeBron on matters of health and wellness, which are part of his job to some extent, than the quality of headphones.  &gt;It's not 1950.  I am aware.  That does not at all change the fact that study after study says that people trust celebrities and are influenced by what they do and say.  There is neuroscience behind this.  People's brains have not changed since 1950.  I feel like I am talking to a person who lives in another reality.  [https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/2017/11/03/brain-science-heres-why-you-cant-resist-celebrity-endorsements/827171001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/2017/11/03/brain-science-heres-why-you-cant-resist-celebrity-endorsements/827171001/)  Celebrities and athletes are not paid billions and billions a year to endorse things on a hunch.  They are paid because it works and that is a fact."
"Yeah, an upgraded Brogdon would be like tall Chris Paul.  Pretty lofty label to throw on Haliburton...  In fact most of these are unreasonable comps."
Are we depending on Chris Paul being healthy all year? That will likely be the issue.
Chris Paul  Joe Johnson  Lebron James  Kevin Garnett  Nikola Jokic
"The ""dirty"" thing is why I think of Chris Paul too. He's pretty physical/dirty for his size."
PG: Chris Paul  SG: Steph Curry  SF: Devin Booker  PF: Mikal Bridges  C:Bill Russell
"It depends.  If we're working our way through a tough, evenly fought game and it comes down to the last shot, we're solid. Between Chris Paul and Devin Booker, we've got two players that excel in taking those tough, big moment shots.  If we have, say, a 20+ point lead against an under 500 team, or a team missing two of their three all star players, its more or less a guarantee that we're going to fuck it up."
"Yeah, and getting used to playing NBA defense is a LOT harder than getting used to playing offense.  Most rookie players suck at defense, even ones who become really good defenders later.  Chris Paul was *not* a good defender as a rookie, and neither was LeBron.  It took both of them a few years to really find their stride on that end, as it does almost everyone.  Zion is an incredible athlete, but he's not particularly tall or long, two things that can help make up for the inevitable bad rookie/sophomore defensive instincts at the NBA level.  Subjectively, he definitely seems to not be playing defense with the intensity he did at Duke (at times) either, although I imagine most of that is by design, whether it's to prevent injury/make up for lacking endurance/keep him moving less hectically on defense to try and slow the game down for him.    It's pretty clear he has tremendous defensive potential, although he's also got a long way to go...which should be entirely expected at this point in his career.  He's so good offensively already that if he even becomes an average defender he's going to be an absolute superstar.  ESPN RPM for instance has him as the 3rd best offensive Power Forward so far this year (albeit a distant third behind Giannis and KD)...but also the 3rd *worst* defensive PF, better than only Gallinari and Rui.  I'm not sure if I'd go that far personally, but yeah, he has a lot of work to do on that end, but it's work I think he can do."
Chris Paul  Klay Thompson  PJ Tucker  Zion  Jokic
Chris Paul Ginobili Lebron Dirk ibaka
"Yeah I don’t know why some people don’t appreciate Stockton honestly. To me he felt like Chris Paul (who gets proper respect now and then depending on the season, it seems.)  Just looked up Stockton’s numbers and this jumped out to me: he played 82 games in 16 different seasons!"
"But how does this get us Chris Paul, our PGOTF?"
"honestly with so many fans who got into basketball through the dynasty warriors, all of them missed the prime versions of guys like Blake, fast Chris Paul, and Marc Gasol. they've seen good years from them, some of their best even, but not THE best. Blake was something else, especially that first two years. he was on the sports center top ten like 3 times a week."
Chris Paul George Hill
Chris Paul used to give Dame the blues bad
"I can agree with those selections for sure.      - Zion gets in to replace AD.   - Fox gets in to replace PG.   - Booker and DeMar as wildcards.      Wouldn't be surprised if Chris Paul found his way in somehow, probably gets the pick over Fox since his reputation and winning gives him the edge."
"The Clippers series was infuriating because Bogut in his first big chance to shine for us got injured right at the end of the season and was out for the season, and then Chris Paul fouled Curry on that last 3 for the final shot in game 7 and nothing was called."
"It was extremely lame....but the point is guys aren't leaving after like a couple bad seasons. Almost every superstar has stayed at least 7-10 years on one team before wanting out. Bron-7 in Cleveland, AD-7 in new Orleans, Dwight-8 years in Orlando, Chris Paul-6 in New Orleans, Hayward-7 in Utah, PG-7 in Indiana, Aldridge-9 in Portland, Harden- 10 years in Houston."

"Yeah, but the fact is that in the last 4 years, Harden has 3 scoring titles, and 1 assist title, and leads the league in assists right now. Literally 5/5 in one or the other depending on what he wants.  What are the arguments for KD or Curry? **IF** they took more shots, they could score more? **IF** you put Curry under MDA, he would drop 40/5/15 a game? **IF** Chris Paul didn't injure his hamstring, Rockets win a championship?  The fact is that none of that matters because it's hypothetical, and what we have is that Harden has been the best scorer and distributer in the league in the last 5 years."
"What?? Chris Paul on Clippers? Thought he went to Lakers and went on to be the greatest PG, my bad i've been in coma since 2011"
"Yeah he just got carried by Lebron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, Paul Pierce, and Kevin Garnett."
"I could totally see Chris Paul inspiring intercity youth all while he lives in his one bedroom apartment, never able to quite find love for himself, but the kids are his true passion"
"Chris Paul stopped flopping, pat bev stopped playing dirty, and blake griffin can still jump. They’ve been unstoppable!"
"It's because he yells, mostly at the refs, from the opening tip to the final whistle.  Anyone's voice would be raspy as hell if you did that 3 times a week.  I've said this on here before, I've been to a bunch of NBA games, and have been lucky to sit close most of the time.  I saw the Lob City Clippers 3 times, it was such a terrible experience.  Doc bitched non stop at all of the games.  His voice carries too.  And his constant bitching led to Chris Paul constantly bitching, and Blake as well.  It's like if you play FPS games and you got one friend who gets toxic and starts saying it's bullshit when he dies, then your other teammates start saying it and coming up with excuses like lag and other BS.       I didn't get to see the Doc Celtics up close but I can't even imagine how bad it would be with both him AND Thibs constantly yelling and then KG screaming nonsense (seriously KG's trash talking sounds insane, it's like a mix of gibberish mixed in with motherfucker and the N word.)"
Imo if Chris Paul stays healthy the rockets win in 2018
Chris Paul averaged 12-13 shots his last 5 years
Lol no. Most players would have been gone way sooner if they were in Harden’s position. How are you gonna have one of the best offensive players of all time and only manage to pair him up with an aging Chris Paul? No disrespect to CP3 (I know he’s reading this) but that isn’t gonna cut it for a title. Cheap owner and doesn’t care about winning.
"Tyson Chandler signed his big paydays years after playing with Chris Paul.  He was awful in Charlotte and was playing on a contract year in Dallas in 2011 where he solidified himself as an elite defensive anchor, then he signed with New York in 2011-12 (nearly 3 seasons removed from playing with Chris Paul).   his second contract was in 2015, going on a decade removed from playing with Chris Paul.   Paul didn't do shit for his contracts. His defense on a title team, and making New York a playoff team are what got him his contracts."
"Yeah wth is this guy talking about. Tyson was arguably on his way out of the league before 2011. He was often injured and barely played for a horrible Bobcats team. He averaged 6 ppg and 6 rpg. He almost missed an entire season between 2008-2010 due to injuries. This was a guy who was traded along with Alexis Ajincia for Erick Dampier, Matt Carroll and Eduardo Najera.   In Dallas he was projected as a possible backup to Brendan Haywood. His stock was at an all time low. People didn't care about his New Orleans days with Chris Paul because he was seemingly on the decline, often injured, and getting old.   Up until that point he had never reached his full potential either, as a #2 pick he was never the star GMs expected. He gets to Dallas and revitalizes his career, he makes his first all defensive team, then gets paid in New York. Wins DPOY and is an All Star, then he opts to go to Phoenix to get paid. Chris Paul didn't do shit for him.   &amp;#x200B;  His contract history is:   Rookie Deal with Chicago from 2001-2005 for $12M/4 years (Before Chris Paul)    Rookie Extension with Chicago from 2005-2011 for $54M/5 years (Before Chris Paul)  Sign and Trade from Dallas to New York for $58M/4 years  Signs with Phoenix for $52M/ 4 years  Vet min deals  &amp;#x200B;  He signed two major contracts after playing with Paul, the first was right after the Mavericks' championship where he revitalized his career from injured rim runner to defensive anchor, and the second was when he went to Phoenix nearly 10 years after playing with Chris Paul."
Chris Paul - School Teacher
2 words: Chris Paul
Chris Paul is really good at getting centers paid
"True, but it’s not like Chris Paul was doing all that well here anyway"
"A hurt Chris Paul is not, though."
"Ehhh we had Dwight who refused to listen to the coach, Chris paul who blew his hammy, Chris paul who was terrible, and then Westbrook who was hurt and terrible.   Not the best selection there"
"Who was better than Kyrie, yup that’s Chris Paul"
Chris Paul is a good enough second option to win a championship
His best teammate was Chris Paul
Are Chris Paul and John Stockton top 5 players ever? Better than lebron? No.
Blake Griffin isn't an authority on cars and Chris Paul is not an authority on insurance but despite that incredibly savvy and well financed corporations with reams of market research find that what Blake Griffin says about cars and what Chris Paul says about insurance sways people's opinions about those things.
Was half this sub even alive when Chris Paul assaulted Julius Hodges' family jewels on national TV?
"Chris Paul is underrated, in my opinion, he is like Dirk if Dirk never got that one in 2011. That changed the whole story about Dirk and made all of his prior accomplishments count for more. The only thing you could hold against Chris Paul is that he hasn't got over that hump, but if he had won just one, I think people would give him so much more credit for everything he's done."
Who the fuck is gonna forget about Chris Paul besides casuals?? Lmao tf
"Chris Paul will never be forgotten. Did people forget Jason Kidd, Stockton, Nash?"
"Right: I said the Suns would be good, and solidly in the playoff picture. That seems to be true. My reasoning was that Chris Paul makes a big difference, and they have good talent, and they could just plug CP3 in and it would work.  Wrong: I thought the Mavericks would be one of the top West teams. They've had a rough start and that's partly due to factors no one could have predicted, like COVID affecting them worse than most teams. They still have a chance to turn it around and be a good team, but they do have some issues beyond just COVID, and I don't think they can get into the upper echelon of the West."
"Sure, but then we also have to give 2008 to Chris Paul."
"Check out this 538 article on why Jordan was the best. They did their All Time RAPTOR ratings and CP3 was 2nd.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-michael-jordan-was-the-best/  The entire list of current players on there is Chris Paul, Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Draymond Green, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, and Kevin Durant, which really tracks well with who the most important guys of all time were.  Chris Paul has just had bad playoff luck, with the injury in Houston, and honestly Doc Rivers coaching probably cost him with the Clippers. If you dig into the advanced stats the biggest reason they kept losing in the playoffs is because they let Jamal Crawford take too many of the shots and he was horribly inefficient."
"House wasn't even a replacement. We got him from the G-League on a two-way contract. Then his 45 days were up and Tilman didn't want to pay him so he wasn't on the roster for half the season over a contract during the most injured stretch of the season.   We replaced Ariza and Luc Mbah a Moute, who was imo the better defender that season, with Melo, MCW, and James Ennis. Only minimum players allowed because Tilman didn't want to pay the tax. Chris Paul played much worse and Capela wasn't as good on switches. Gordon was inconsistent af.   Harden and Tucker were the only constants and Morey managed to find other guys like Austin Rivers, Kenneth Faried, Iman Shumpert, Gary Clark Jr, all while being mandated to stay out of the tax. This is why it's infuriating to hear that the Rockets gave Harden everything he wanted, that roster wasn't even close to the same."
"i was trying to point out the roster was not very good without westbrook. chris paul last year was not as good as westbrook in 2017, and the roster in cp had was better than the one westbrook had.  dont disagree about ur point guard statement"
"A 53 year old Chris Paul dragged a weaker version of that team further than Westbrook ever did, and didn't receive any MVP consideration"
"&gt;Yeah I don't know if any team wins a seven game series against a fully healthy warriors team.   You're forgetting about the 2018 Rockets, right? I'm not sure why people try to deny it but the Rockets were up 3-2 against the Warriors and it took an injury to a star player and the coldest streak from 3 in NBA history to stop them from winning the series. Chris Paul being healthy would've A) gotten their shooters better looks and more accurate passes to their shooting pockets so that they could've potentially made more of their shots, and B) put way more pressure on Steph as an on-ball defender, leading to more breakdowns of the defense and a more fatigued Steph on offense."
"Wut? I don’t even think the Lakers are better than the Chris Paul + Harden Rockets tbh, though I know that may not be popular."
Still has some of the quickest feet I've seen from a big man switched onto Chris Paul.
Chris Paul is at 69/71 while Quickley is at 69/73.   Will be interesting how close these dudes stay for the season haha.
So for Chris Paul to move into first place all-time he would need to make 30 consecutive free throws.
Chris Paul the most all around player of all time. Doesnt have a single weakness in his game except health.
This was a damn good game! I was there and my son didn't believe the Nets would lose. I was skeptical when they were down 20 points. But they pulled it out. Chris Paul was full on beast mode there at the end though.
"Because people do smooth brain dick measuring contests instead of just enjoying players ball the fuck out. Narrative gets out of hand and I feel like people really forget about just sitting back and enjoying some basketball.  Did you see Chris Paul, Dame, Harden, OG tonight? They were wiiiiiiildin"
Why didn’t they go for Chris Paul?
Harden and Tillman Fertitta are idiots for trading Chris Paul for Westbrook. I can’t believe how bad that trade was.
Lol how is 36 year old Chris Paul still the best player on that team?
"“When it gets to clutch time, fourth quarter, some people built for it, some people shy away from it, so we’re just going to keep hooping.” Chris Paul, ESPN"
chris paul has been hilariously clutch the last two years.
"Given how insanely good harden is at passing this season, he must've absorbed some of chris paul's essence through osmosis during their time together on the rockets.    After chris paul, jokic and lebron, the way Hardens been playing this season he's prolly the next best passser."
If CP wasn't so bad in 2019 then maybe he stays.  Chris Paul was not blameless. He was flat out bad for a star player in 2019.
Why the hell did Chris Paul not get the ball for the Suns last possession? Not that I’m mad or anything 🤣
"Man that was an unbelievable fourth quarter. Pretty much the best offensive quarter of basketball I’ve ever seen. Chris Paul is unbelievable, Brooklyn had all the answers though playing as a team without their stars. Just all round amazing basketball game."
"Well Devin went completely cold this game, and Chris Paul is one of the best passers of all time."
"I know, he’s the man for the suns, but it’s Chris Paul"
Chris Paul on fire in the 4th Suns: let’s iso Devon booker instead
"This just confirmed my thoughts. Best player this game was body crazy, curvy, wavy, big titties, lil' waist. Also, Chris Paul is still a sexy little bitch."
Chris Paul was doing everything possible to hold off the comeback...  What a wild game
"Best player this game was body crazy, curvy, wavy, big titties, lil' waist.  Also, Chris Paul is still a sexy little bitch."
"Look how much Chris Paul worked on his height this offseason! Dunking like a center now, leagues fucked"
Chris Paul is the shortest 6 foot man I have ever seen
"58% true shooting is good but not amazingly high, especially against college defenses. And an assist to turnover ratio of 1.6 to 1 is also kind of mixed. And he had lots of points and assists but also a massive usage rate of almost 40%.   He was an excellent prospect but there were significant question marks around how well his game would translate. He is also really small. Small guys often struggle a lot against the length and athleticism of the NBA. Among recent players only Steph, Chris Paul, Irving and Damian Lillard have managed to be elite and around his size. And he’s even smaller than all those guys except for maybe Paul.  He was usually compared to Steph. But in a less efficient era Steph had 60-64% TS and much better advanced stats. Steph had a WS/40 of 0.35 in college compared to Trae’s 0.20. And Steph himself needed several years of improvement to become really good.  Even with all that he was the 5th pick, which is pretty high. And I think he deserves credit for just straight up improving his game every year. His TS% is actually higher now against NBA defenses than it was in college."
Old Chris Paul. I think he’s actually more like Paul Pierce and LeBron.
"It would be pretty sick to be a culture changer. Go to a shit team and turn it around. Or a team on the cusp and being able to get them to the next level like Chris Paul did with the sun's. I think those memories would be longer lasting than anything else, especially if you end up with a ring."
you know people are 12 on this sub when they say chris paul isnt fast lmfao that dude was the fastest player in the league in his prime
"Oh shit you are right lol. Well he was a cocky young buck wasn't he. He acts like a first step is everything in this world. He has skill, strength,size and smarts. Tbh he plays like a big white Chris Paul. Does he blow by his guy. Not really he gets them on his hip and controls the midrange area where he can shoot draw a foul or pass to openings. Add a mean step back jumper and you've got a deadly offensive player. Kuz thinks like a guy who has a lot of natural physical talent. Just out athletic everyone no need to get physical or control pace"
"There are only about 3,000 people above 7 feet tall. This means that big men are less likely to be outliers in terms of skill and durability and even athleticism. Lower sample size just means there’s a lower chance that you get a sniper like Curry, basketball genius like Chris Paul, or all around freak like Lebron.  More practically, big people are also more injury prone. Anatomy doesn’t scale up very well. The giants of every species tend to have more health problems. You can see this effect directly with dogs, where the smaller breeds outlive the largest breeds."
"Phoenix Suns: pg chris paul sg devin booker sf mikal bridges pf crowder  c ayton  bench: payne, shamet, cam johnson, jalen smith, mcgee (if we trade for thaddeus young then insert him at pf)"
"This is some revisionist history. Chris Paul was an incredible/highly above average athlete.   Y'all sleeping on my guy in his prime, you don't rack up that many All-Defensive teams and steals by having 'Luka Doncic foot speed' and you sure as shit don't overcome multiple nagging injuries and keep hopping at an All-NBA level without a high level of athleticism to begin with, especially as a guy who's 5'11"" on a good day IRL."
"Chris Paul is a good comparison. Luka's size/ball and body control is a huge part of what make him such a great player. He doesn't need to blow by guys, he can either bully them or out-maneuver them because he has a million ways to react to a defender."
"Especially when you take a guy who is 6'7, and listed at 230 but probably closer to 250.  Why would you expect him to have Allen Iverson type quickness?  He is more like an oversized Chris Paul."
such a classic call too.   here comes chris paul. ^THE ^LOB. ^^THE ^^JAM! Oh what a monster jam by DeAndre Jordan!
"They also develop out of necessity, Chris Paul wouldn't have made the league at 6ft if he had the skills that LeBron had when he came out. When you are smaller you absolutely have to be way more skilled than everyone else, that's all you might have.  Not saying that LeBron doesn't have skill btw, he is extremely skilled relative to his size, but compare his ball handling and shooting skills to CP3 when they both came out and it's night and day."
But it is though right? Chris Paul explained how his height limited some of the passes he wants to do.
"And the closest active player is Chris Paul who is 933 steals behind him and the next is LeBron who is 1,202 behind Stockton. I don't think that record is coming down anytime soon."
And Chris Paul got injured
Chris Paul&gt;
"Lavine also averaged 27 and booker didn’t carry, he didn’t even make the playoffs without chris Paul. Lavine is more athletic too"
"In this category I have Chris Paul, who shows up and plays well for every team he's on, despite getting kinda shuffled around and not being part of the sun's or thunder's long term plan.  He played well with the clippers, where I hated him. He played well in his short time with the rockets, his short time with the thunder, and almost won a championship with the suns. Dude could have been ring chasing but he got damn close to just bringing the ring to him.  Begrudgingly, I respect Chris Paul."
&gt;leading a team with zero all stars to 65 wins  Cool fun fact but no reason for it to be bolded lol we all know Chris Paul was all nba caliber much less an all star that year but missed it due to injuries
The best part of this was always Chris Paul walking around with a look on his face wondering if he should call a lawyer to defend himself as accessory to that murder.
"That's objectively wrong:  * Both Melo and Pierce led their teams to one conference finals pre-Big 3 Celtics.  * Melo led the nuggets to the playoffs every year after he was drafted and was the leading scorer on all of those teams, something pierce was unable to do. Pierce didn't lead the celtics to the playoffs until his fourth year on the team. * Melo had to face objectively stiffer competition to make the conference finals, beating MVP candidate Chris Paul in NO and prime Dirk with a decent secondary scorer in Jerry Stackhouse. He lost to a prime Pau-Kobe Lakers team that won 65 games. The Nets team that Pierce lost to in his ECF didn't even win 50 games. * 32 year old Billups didn't even average 20 points and had barely over 50 efg% in 2008-09; he was good and probably better than antoine walker, but wasn't lighting the world on fire. Allen Iverson was traded at the beginning of the year Anthony made the ECF.  * In 2007-08 (the year before Iverson was washed up), the Nuggets won 50 games and were still the 8th seed - they also lost to the Pau-Kobe Lakers who were dominating that period."
Chris Paul and Mikal Bridges
Show the play where Chris Paul and DeAndre Jordan win a ring
"PG: Chris Paul  SG: Devin Booker  SF: Mikal Bridges   PF: Cam Johnson  C: Deandre Ayton  Bench 5: Jae Crowder, Cam Payne, Abdel Nader, Javale McGee, Landry Shamat"
Chris Paul until he played that year for OKC. He played that situation super classy.
"Starting: Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, Deandre Ayton Next 5: Cam Payne, Landry Shamet, Cam Johnson, Jalen Smith, Javale McGee"
And Chris Paul fouled Steph in 2014.
Chris Paul. Lotta grizz fans feel the same way
"Chris Paul for me. I didn't like him in Houston or LA, he always just seemed to be hellbent on swaying the officials into making favourable decisions for his team. He's now one of my favourite players to watch. He's a leader and one of the best finishers in the league. If Chris stayed longer, his jersey would be retired"
"Chris Paul. Thunder fan, so it wasn't until I waw him on our team."
"&gt; Dame exclusively guards other PGs.  Thank you, I’ve not had a good laugh yet today.  In the three games Blazers played the Suns this year, Dame’s defensive assignments were as follows: * Mikal Bridges 17:28 * Chris Paul 3:46 * Devin Booker 3:04 * Jae Crowder 3:02 * Cam Payne 2:09  All of them played in all three games btw.  &gt; They’re both at least always guarding and being guarded by other guards.  Dame was guarded by Mikal for 20:28 over those three games. Far and away more than any other guard."
Used to hate Chris Paul on the Hornets/Clippers. Cheered for him on the Rockets. And then he came to Phoenix
"Chris Paul. Always respected his skill and ability, but his brand of flopping and barking at the referees on the lob city clippers really grinded my gears.  Now that more players do it, especially draymond on my own home team, I’ve got no legs to stand on and just appreciate him for the amazing talent he is."
"Honestly... everybody.  If I read more about them, my respect increases. They've all overcome hardships and beat out extreme competition. My dislike for an NBA player is only ever an initial gut reaction and it doesn't last when tested.  ...  ^^disclaimer: ^^fuck ^^chris ^^paul"
Barkley's Suns choked in 93 but everyone seems to remember his Finals run fondly  I'd imagine Chris Paul has a similar legacy to Barkley
Chris Paul is just Tyler Ulis with a State Farm commercial
"If AD was hurt, why did he play?  Chris Paul was a literal 0 factor. The Suns struggled when he was on the floor. You can look at a box score and say “oh he had six assists though” but the numbers don’t tell the context. I watched the series not the box score.   AD did most of his damage from the free throw line, which is a valid strategy, don’t get me wrong. He did not look good when he wasn’t on it. He missed wide open mid range shots often and just didn’t look great. The narrative all season, even from Lakers fans, was that AD looked content after 1 ring and it looked true in that series.   You can be mad that the Suns played who was in front of them but it doesn’t rewrite history"
"He plays like a shooting guard. Most point guards in today's game are SGs that bring the ball up the floor. Curry Kyrie Luka etc are all shoot first players. The only true PGs I see as pass first guys are Chris Paul, Rondo, and Trae."
"Its either that or renowned Karen Chris ""tuck your shirt in"" Paul"
"LeBron, Chris Paul  Warriors fan. Rooted against LeBron with his ""super team"" Heat. Then against him when he was with the Cavs vs. The Warriors. Eventually just watching him over and over again he earned some begrudging respect.  Similar with Paul, he was a rival of the Warriors his whole career and flopped horribly and constantly. Eventually I realized he was just a great player and I rooted for him last year in the playoffs."
So Chris Paul isn't a PG he's a PF because he spent the finals guarding PJ Tucker?
"Chris Paul, really thought he was just born into the wrong generation of point guard and didn’t have the mentality to take a team deep in the playoffs. He’s proven me very wrong in the last few years and that’s from a bucks fan."
Chris paul for some reason
Chris Paul. Now I love that dude
"Chris Paul, used to think he was a bit of a brat now I find him absolutely hilarious"
Oh that makes more sense. I don’t agree tho. We were getting Carmelo Anthony and I have no doubt the could have attracted another star to New York like a Chris Paul or even Dwayne Wade. Much easier to convince someone to join Bron and Melo in MSG than Bron then just Bron in Cleveland of all places. At the end of the day I think he made the right choice because he got two rings out of it but I do definitely think he could’ve done what he did in Miami in New York
The Bucks didn’t really benefit that much while the Suns got prime Chris Paul lol
"Yes, just because Devin Booker made the NBA Finals last year while beating injured team after injured team, he must have all the right answers on how to practice and be better.  I mean, why even criticize someone, let's just assume that because he is an NBA player he must be correct in everything that relates to basketball. This is the same Devin Booker that hadn't won more than 35 games before Chris Paul arrived in Phoenix, he must be right."
"No, they win if the refs either call it fairly or if Chris Paul plays"
"He was in the same draft as Chris Paul and Deron Williams, but I was convinced that he would be the best PG in that draft. Then again, I thought that Myck Kabongo would be a generational PG, as well. Needless to say, I've never been offered a GM job."
It seems like a lot of teams try to do that every year. The Bucs and pre-KD Warriors didn’t sign any superstars and didn’t have any high draft picks. Giannis and Steph became superstars but they didn’t grab them in free agency or with top couple picks. Same with the Spurs dynasty. They drafted all of their main guys and except for Duncan they were later picks. And the people they signed were generally just really solid pieces.  And plenty of recent teams tried to just sign solid pieces and failed. That’s what the Jazz did just last year. No superstars and just a lot of really solid players and they got the 1 seed. Same with the Suns. Chris Paul wasn’t really considered a superstar anymore or a top 10-15 player. And certainly not the other guys they grabbed. The Raptors tried to win without any true superstar for a long time and only broke through when they landed Kawhi. And even then they needed multiple major injures to the Warriors to win.
"Yeah... I still remember how there was a debate for a while: D-Will or Chris Paul.   D-Will got to the conference finals early, and people were stoked that him and Boozer were the next Stockton and Malone.   But Sloan and D-Will just didn't get along."
"Dirk without a doubt and it isn’t close.  Chris Paul was in a similar situation this year, I saw people saying he’s a top 3-5 PG of All-Time if he won the ring. Unfortunately he only cemented his legacy as a playoff choker and I don’t know if he’ll ever make it back to the Finals."
"OG and Hunter are not “definitely” better defenders than him, that’s an absurd r/NBA take.   OG is marginally better than him sure, but saying Hunter is “definitely” better is legit laughable. Hunter is NOT better than Mikal, in fact I think he’s clearly worse at this point. Mikal is one of the most disruptive defenders in the entire NBA, Mikal’s arm are every bit as long as Hunter’s, and is a much quicker and active defender. Mikal is by far the best perimeter defender on a team that was top 10 in the regular season on defense and was 2nd going into the Finals (finished 4th).   Devin Booker and Chris Paul are essentially on the same level on defense at this point, by the wcf and the finals CP3 was getting hunted more than Booker was on defense. I believe Ayton is one of the best post defenders in the league, but Capela is up there as well.   Looking at the lineups, Atlanta has every bit the defenders Phoenix does… so why were the Suns considerably better on defense both in the regular season and playoffs than the Hawks? Mikal. So again, it’s laughable to say Hunter is “definitely” better than Mikal"
Chris Paul would sure as hell have stopped 0-27 lol
nope. the warriors won the last 2 games by 38 combined points. chris paul was not stopping the warriors when they got hot.
"thats why the warriors won the 2 most important games. chris paul would not have stopped the warriors (Curry, Klay, KD) from getting hot"
"If the 96 bulls with Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen were injured vs this years Suns, Suns fans would still say “BUT WE DIDNT HAVE CHRIS PAUL” so they won fair and square lol"
So if Chris Paul was healthy in 2018 would Harden have magically become strong enough to make a playoff run?
"Maybe not best all time, but Chris Paul/Jrue, Booker, Middleton, Giannis, and Ayton would be a ridiculous starting lineup."
"&gt;NBA is a bad place when Lakers run the show. And even a decade before they nearly acquired Chris Paul, they had the arguably greatest duo in basketball history winning the championship three years in a row  But you seem to have forgotten that those Lakers had horrible coaches and it took Phil Jackson to finally win.   Lmao everyone's got a superteam now though, isn't that why Cubes swung for the fences for Zingis and traded for Luka?  Typical r/nba ""buT mUh pAriTy"" response when it comes to team building for opponents but happy af when their team does it.  But keep the hate coming, kinda missed it when we were shit for a while. You know, that time when no free agent wanted to come because we were horrible and were a shitshow...and were getting rightfully clowned as a result.   So yeah fuck the perspective of other fanbases. You on the bottom of the totem and we back at the top so your perspective can be on this scrotum ^shoutout ^Kanye  &gt;&gt;you sound salty"
"I think the best ones have already been mentioned so I'm just gonna mention a couple fun/interesting ones I found:  2021: Chris Paul - Booker - Middleton - Giannis - Ayton/Lopez, obviously not one of the best but it's actually kind of a sick squad.  2002: Kidd - Kobe - Van Horn - Kenyon Martin - Shaq, holy crap Kidd and Shaq would be so dumb.  2006: Jason Terry - Wade - Antoine Walker - Dirk - Shaq, this would be an insanely fun one.  2005: Billups/Parker - Rip Hamilton - Tayshaun Prince - Duncan - Ben Wallace, in some orientation? Ginobili started every game this series so he could be somewhere in here, you could maybe run both Parker and Billups, idk you could shuffle this one around a lot.  1974:  Oscar Robertson/JoJo White - John Havlicek - Bob Dandridge - Dave Cowens - Kareem. This was a pretty fun find, the reason Robertson's spot is split with White is that he was 35 at the time and didn't play super well that Finals, then retired."
"Lol I mean the argument is that if Chris Paul plays the rockets have a very good chance of winning and destroying an easy finals matchup. They were up 3-2 on probably the best team ever and won 65 games. Would you not agree that harden was good enough to win a championship as the best player on the team that season? If Chris Paul played and we won, harden would be no better or worse as a basketball player. Literally just the circumstances change.   Steph 6 years ago won a championship against a depleted squad and didn’t even win FMVP. Kawhi won his with the raptors due to the warriors getting super injured. KD won on a 73-9 team. Giannis won in the most injured season ever.  Harden just didn’t get luck and circumstances to fall on his side but he absolutely was good enough to win a ring as the best player on his team, and that ring would have been probably the most impressive one ever too. The 2018 rockets led by harden were historic"
Chris Paul on them elbows
Chris Paul on them elbows
"&gt;does no one remember that the suns beat the lakers in game 1  And?   &gt;were leading when AD went out in game 4,  By 4.  &gt;CP3 was hurt in the games we lost   Nobody forgets this. But a healthy LeBron and AD are obvious more impactful than a healthy Chris Paul  &gt;the suns had the best home court advantage in the playoffs last year??  And?"
Basically Chris Paul now except at a clear tier below  Now Dirk arguably has a better legacy than CP3
2006 and 2007 maybe which were cp3 first years   2008 and forward is clearly chris paul
Swap Chris Paul with Westbrook.  Chris Paul had a good playoffs but he is not in A+ territory.
PG: Kyrie  SG: Harden  SF: LeBron PF: Kevin  C: AD  BPG: Russ  BSG: Malik  BSF: Melo  BPF: Blake  BC: Dwight  11M: Lamarcus  12M: Millsap 13M: Bazemore  NP: Chris Paul  NP: Claxton   How much help does Malik Monk need?
"Chris Paul. No one really talks about Jason Kidd, Tim Hardaway, etc anymore. The PG position is so dynamic now current PGs put up crazy stats that dwarf guys in the position historically."
"They will still test them hopefully, but perhaps not as often.  They tested Chris Paul positive even though he was vaccinated, I doubt they stop doing that"
"Let me tell you something from other fanbases perspective:  NBA is a bad place when Lakers run the show. And even a decade before they nearly acquired Chris Paul, they had the arguably greatest duo in basketball history winning the championship three years in a row.  I find it hilarious that you find Mavericks a superteam, when Lakers have acquired some of the most well known all stars in the 00's and 10's. According to that logic the Los Angeles Lakers are a superteam."
&gt;You sound salty  Of fucking course I am. Mark Cuban (and Dan Gilbert) cost us Chris Paul.  But me being salty doesn't it make it less true.  Gilbert and Cuban publicly bitching to Stern about the Lakers becoming a superteam got that deal axed.  Funny thing is that both Gilbert and Cuban both ended up trying to create superteams themselves. Gilbert succeeded and won a chip...and Cuban...is still trying.
"Exactly, I can't believe Dirk was able to stick it out mentally after (in chronological order):   * a blown 2-0 lead in the Finals to Miami * a first round upset to the Warriors as the 1st seed (first time in the 7-game playoffs era) * a first round exit to the Hornets led by Chris Paul * a semi-final loss to the Nuggets * another first round exit this time to the Spurs as the 2nd seed  Then after beating all odds of being shell shocked from all the shortcomings, he goes supernova in 2011 to win it. One of the greatest journeys I have seen in the NBA."
"Yours would be Chris Paul. You had 3 very good starters once Ayton and Bridges developed to that point, got a star on a discount (due to his age) and made the finals.   For the Pacers I would say the similar outcome would be Turner becoming the 3pt shooter he threatens to be, Sabonis becoming a top 5 offensive big man in the league (literally 5th since there's such a huge gap after Embiid, Jokic, AD and Giannis unless I'm forgetting someone). Or trading one for a wing so their teams fits, then getting that Chris Paul/Kawhi type break.   The Pistons are more likely to win a title than the Pacers over the next 10 years sure, because their rebuild is going well. But are the Pacers less likely than the Cavs? Probably not."
"PPG ain't everything chief. Guys like Draymond, Chris Paul and Fred VanVleet being the model"
"Lol it was 3-2 until Chris Paul couldn’t play anymore. They got bailed out, I don’t care about your mental gymnastics"
"Upon successful buyout negotiations, Shaquille O'Neal, Paul Pierce, Dwayne Wade, Chris Bosh, Mugsy Bogues, Jeremy Lin, Derrick Rose, Andre Iguadala, Yao Ming, Carmelo Anthony, Joakim Noah, John Wall, and the entire 2013 Memphis Grizzlies roster have signed two way contracts with the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets--whichever team makes it to the finals."
Now Detroit just needs to buy out Chris Paul in a couple of years
"There still were Pau and prime Marc Gasol in the league. Tim Duncan had one down year but was still a great player with the entire arsenal. LMA was still young and was Portland's best player. Kevin Love played some all-time seasons with the Wolves operating as a post players almost entirely, Boogie Cousins was emerging and AD was drafted the season after '12. Chris Bosh dominated the post but played a different role in Miami. Al Jefferson was a post maestro and in his prime, David West played really well and Paul Millsap was averaging 17 with a great post move arsenal. Oh and Dirk was still All-NBA level.  Not saying he didn't have a argument for one of the best post players but saying no guys with good post moves were in the league until Jokic and Embiid is way off."
It would have been fine if Chris Paul played. Harden had to do everything himself with no secondary ball handler
Are Chris Paul and LRMAM playoff caliber?
I wonder if Chris Paul lets Jordan touch his head. Maybe that's why he gets so mad when other people touch it
"&gt; If you have James Harden and Chris Paul on your team and can't find anything other than contested 3's, then yes I think that's a flawed offense.  0-27 happened with Chris Paul being out of the game though. I believe he hurt his hamstring in game 5 and 0-27 was game 7.  Harden was basically the only ballhandler they had outside of maybe Eric Gordon who is REALLY streaky to say the least, basically everyone was ice cold from 3 (Ariza went 0-12 that game)."
"I would say a good offense can adapt to hot/cold players or teams. Most teams, if they're having a poor shooting night, will not try and brute force their way through it - they take the pressure off hitting those particular shots, and try to generate different looks. If you have James Harden and Chris Paul on your team and can't find anything other than contested 3's, then yes I think that's a flawed offense."
"&gt; The 0-27 game is a clear example where you'd want a coach to step in, and try something different.  I don't even know what the alternate solution is though. They were the less talented team even with Chris Paul. Do you suddenly change the team identity with an even larger talent gap than what was there two games prior?  Like I get that we have the benefit of hindsight, buy gambling on variance seems like the actual best move there. We can sit here knowing the result and criticize it but I'm just not sure what a reasonable alternative would have been."
"&gt;Paul and AD both got to the second round of the playoffs with Pelicans. Both times we lost to the eventual NBA champion.   This is incorrect. You're right about the time AD's team got to the second round and lost to the KD Warriors, but Chris Paul made it to the second round in 2008 with New Orleans and lost to the Spurs in 7. The Spurs went on to lose to the Lakers in 5 games in the next round, and the Lakers went on to lose to the Celtics in the Finals."
"The concept of wasting talent is so selectively applied. In the NFL, we were accused of wasting Drew Brees' talent for years...after we won a Superbowl. Packers have been accused of same thing with Rodgers.      Everybody likes to think we wasted Chris Paul. We put talent around him to help him almost win MVP. We brought in a head coach that had led a team to the NBA Finals previously. We spent big each year on the best FA available to us on the roster. We made the playoffs 3 times. When it all failed, we tried to rebuild and CP3 forced his way out and trashed us on the way out. Nobody at the time knew that CP3 was a problem (see Clippers and Rockets) and Pelicans took all the blame for that. Try recruiting after that.      Dell was terrible and maybe his only good move, bringing in Boogie was ruined by injury. We wasted AD. He also never gave his all with us. He was soft in his early years and injury prone. Then he refused to play center which was his best position.      We're now trying with Zion, but guy has only played two seasons and narrative is we are wasting his talent. We've made some bad decisions but barely had a chance yet.      People also forget the Pelicans have had a lot of talent, but also played in the hardest conference and in the hardest division. San Antonio won 4 titles, went to the finals twice. Dallas won 1, made two NBA finals. The Houston Rockets are a big market and perennial playoff team."
Just a blind look at DBPM career leaders w/o looking at tapes:  David Robinson  Tim Duncan  Hakeem Olajuwon  Kevin Garnett  Draymond Green  Ben Wallace  Kawhi Leonard  Rudy Gobert  Chris Paul  Joakim Noah  Michael Jordan  Manu Ginobili   John Stockton  Lebron James  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Scottie Pippen  Larry Bird  Dikembe Mutombo   And leaving out a few others who should be on this list.  You tell me I have to watch tape to see if these stats are wrong?
"If that's how everyone in the franchise felt they should have traded him when he was averaging almost 15-5-5 on 38% shooting from 3 and a 2.5 Asst/TO ratio pre-All Star break this year.   If the Market ""dried up"" you still trade him. The reason Morrey even has Ben Simmons is because he had his pick from multiple 1st round talents that Hinkie aquired and the FO landed on Simmons and Embiid as the guys to go forward with.   Your FO sucks at asset management. They have had Chris Paul, AD, and now Zion all in their prime and the furthest they got was the 1st round of the playoffs.   Everyone is talking trash about how you're wasting Zion, but you're also wasting Ingram."
You were up on the suns 2-1 because Chris Paul was playing with 1 arm. You can’t take the AD injury into account but not the CP3 injury.
"50% of playoff basketball is advertising, which is why Chris Paul is undisputedly the best player with his ability to do State Farm commercials."
"How is Harden even remotely similar? Harden gave Houston his all and the era for that Rockets team was done. They tried Chris Paul, CP3, Dwight Howard. Harden dealt with the cheap ass Rockets owner not wanting to all in and go deep in the luxury when the KD Warriors existed.   Harden asked for a trade respectfully in the offseason. Rockets jerked their dicks around and didn’t do shit cause they didn’t want Harden to go to the Sixers. Why would they expect a top player in the league in their 30s to just sit through a rebuild?   Rockets got a good return as well. Y’all just want any excuse to hate on Harden."
There will always be haters. Suns almost won it all last season with Devin Book the number on option. If Chris Paul could actually handle the ball than we should have won but I am not complaining.
"How have you watched the league the last 4 years and not understood by now that the cap is mostly imaginary. You can move any money for any money mostly at any time unless you're wildly over the salary cap.   How many of the ""worst deals around the league"" have moved just in the last 2 or 3 offseasons? Because off the top of my head i can count John Wall, Kemba Walker, Mike Conley, Al Horford, Russell Westbrook twice, Chris Paul twice, Andrew Wiggins, Marc Gasol, Kristaps Porzingis and I'm probably forgetting a good number.  And we can say anything we want about Ben Simmons in the playoffs or about his mental fortitude, whatever. He is at worst the 40th-50th best player in the league. At worst. His athleticism, build and skillset on defense make him uniquely valuable in raising the floor of a team in a way not many guys in the league can do, and said skillset fills a lot of holes for Minnesota. And the kicker is he's coming at the lowest cost he could possibly come at. Based on current valuation I'd say Ben Simmons is the highest upside bad contract in the league. By a country mile. Acquiring Ben Simmons does more for Minnesota at this juncture then any free agent they could hypothetically sign within the next couple offseasons because they're scheduled to be past the cap til '23 anyways. So this penny pinching really overall is so needless. The Wolves need talent. Go and get talent that's available at an all time low asset cost. This isn't rocket science.  Sincerely, Dumbass"
"Depends on fit.  MPJ definitely isn't afraid to shoot, he makes them too. But he's food on defense, a serious liability (see: Chris Paul taking his lunch money all series long)  Ben is afraid to shoot, and a non-factor in the half court, which is horrible for the postseason but he's a stud on defense and is a great ball handler (in the open court)  In the long run probably MPJ on the max cause he has room for growth but if I've got a team that couldn't guard a wheelchair player (a la Portland) I want Ben"
"Phoenix Suns fans 1000000% the worst offenders. Devin Booker is not a good defender and he is not the best player on the team, Chris Paul is."
Chris Paul damn near injured LeBron during these past playoffs.
"Should of just done a ""can you win a championship with a team of these 35+ (year old) players""?  **Starting 5:**  * Al Horford (35) * Paul Millsap (36) * Lebron James (36) * P.J. Tucker (36) * Chris Paul (36)  **Bench:**  * Kyle Lowry (35) * Jeff Green (35) * Goran Dragic (35) * Andre Iguodala (37) * Dwight Howard (35) * Rudy Gay (35) * Carmelo Anthony (37)"
Chris Paul 3.
Seems pretty obvious by history that James Harden and Chris Paul won’t win a championship if they’re your best player.
Really? I see it all the time. People went fucking mental when he did that shimmy on Chris Paul saying he was disrespectful and had no sportsmanship. People crying about how he can't do shit outside of shooting and how he's overrated because he had a good team around him. LeBron fans hate him too because he's essentially prevented him from dominating for 8-10 years straight.  I guess we've had different experiences.
"&gt; can hold their own on the perimeter   Gobert wasn’t being isoed / forced to guard ballhandlers. I’ve watched enough of Harden and Chris Paul fucking the Jazz the last couple playoffs to know he’s awful on the perimeter.   The Clips simply had Reggie/PG iso and blow by the awful Jazz defenders which results in an open layup or three, depending on which Gobert chooses to defend. Could he have made quicker rotations? Absolutely. Would Giannis have rotated even faster? Yep.  But Giannis can’t guard the paint and the corner at the same time. Nobody can. I’m sure he’d make quite a few extra stops that Gobert didn’t, but that series was lost because Gobert is dogshit offensively and because the Jazz wings made Reggie look like Kobe"
Chris Paul way better than anyone in the 2018 East lol  YAY HE BEAT DEMAR DEFROZEN OMG GOAT
&gt;Who did Kobe beat in year 15?  Chris Paul?
Chris Paul as a laker
"In 2011, the Warriors tried trading Curry and Klay to New Orleans for Chris Paul. Dell Demps was up for it, but CP3 refused to commit to GS long-term and killed the deal.  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/warriors-tried-to-trade-stephen-curry-klay-thompson-to-hornets-for-chris-paul-in-2011-report-says/"

"Are you serious? dude has been insane and carrying his team ever since he left OKC.  in 2013 and 2014 he carried teams who had no business being anywhere near the playoffs to them.   in 2015 he carried a wash up Howard and a bunch of role players to the conference finals averaging 27/8/6 on 61 ts%  in 2016 he dragged a team with Eric Gordon as his second best player to the playoffs and won a game against a 72 win team.        in 2017 he dragged the same shitty team to the second round of the playoffs and lost a 6 game series to SAS.   in 2018 he took Durant GSW to a 7 games series with Chris Paul as his second best player.      The list goes on man. Harden with Chris Paul took a team that Lebron, Kyrie and Love couldn't win more than one game against too 7 games. And Chris Paul didn't play in two of those. Harden has been balling out for the last decade basically."
Chris Paul
Chris Paul doesn't pull his hamstring.
Everyone should watch Chris Paul
Chris Paul and Nick young. I won’t say which is which
"I feel like the guys that are seen as kind of boring for how good they are are probably the best to watch. Like TJ McConnell, Chris Paul, Kyle Anderson, or Draymond Green. Guys that consistently make the right decisions."
"Definitely watch: Steve Nash, Chris Paul Definitely don't: Steph Curry, Trae"
That’s literally been ESPN’s agenda for any star playing for a smaller market team. I’m just waiting for some random Chris Paul hamstring strain for the Devin Booker rumors to start
1.Steph (Not Close)  2.Luka  3.Dame  4.Kyrie  5.Trae  6.Chris Paul  7.Jrue  8.Westbrook   9.Fox  10.Simmons
"i think you’re misunderstanding me. i’m saying if you switch AD out for Ayton on the 20-21 Suns and they win, Chris Paul is the #1 reason they win. sorry! it’s not hate, it’s just that AD would still not be “the guy” on that team. he’s an all-time great player but at his core, he’s just not a leader, a killer, etc."
Lmfao you just revealed your own ignorance. The Rockets lost role players from  2018-19 and Chris Paul looked totally washed that year.
"it’s an interesting counterfactual for sure. AD would hands down be the most talented, most productive player on that team, so he would absolutely be the best player in the classic sense. i still think that team’s leader, its clutch player, and its biggest reason for winning in tough playoff matchups would be chris paul 🤷"
Mf chris Paul is always somehow getting/already hurt when his team needs him.
A bit of an out of left field response for a team like the spurs but I would want to see what would have happened in 2015 playoffs if Chris Paul missed that game winner in game 7 and the spurs won in OT.
"Yeap, Some undersized guards are good at posting up, but Curry isn't.  Of course he more than makes it up for it with his other skillsets.   For example Chris Paul is shorter than Curry but I'd say better than post-up than Curry is."
"My team is the suns and with Chris Paul another year older, we don’t stand a chance. Not only that, but the other dominant western conference teams are healthy. We gave em’ hell last year though."
I deeply root for Booker and Chris Paul but putting Suns at no.1 is a bit of a stretch.
"Here's Barkley next to 6'6 [Dan Majerle](https://www.gettyimages.com.au/detail/news-photo/charles-barkley-dan-majerle-and-paul-westphal-of-the-news-photo/664952548)  ...next to [6'6 Chris Mullin and 6'7 Scottie Pippen](https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_641/MTY4MjYyNDk4NzAyNDY4MjYx/chuck-daly-scottie-pippen-charles-barkley-chris-mullin-patrick-ewing-and-dave-gavitt-.webp)  Maybe all 6'6 players are mislabeling their heights? Even if they're adding two inches because of shoes, you never hear people talk about the 6'5 Scottie Pippen or the 6'4 Chris Mullin/Dan Majerle so what's the purpose of even bringing it up when talking about Barkley?"
"This is much more a compliment of KD than it is a critique of Bron.   TBF, the only two people I've seen legit bother KD were Chris Paul and Tony Allen, two much smaller dudes."
"chris paul, doc rivers as coach"
always bet against chris paul.
Chris Paul
"[IF YOU'RE WATCHING THESE HIGHLIGHTS, WATCH THIS VIDEO. This series is my favourite series of NBA basketball ever. This video captures it really well. Can't tell you how many times I've replayed this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrMky4VN924&amp;ab_channel=MaxaMillion711)  I'll never forget the anger I had due to the rebounding in this series. You can see in the fourth quarter of this game alone how many times they had 3 or 4 Offensive Rebound attempts. Spurs were an ATG team and the Clippers put up a hell of a fight.  This series really had **everything**.   - Back and forth wins by both teams, check.  - Home and Away wins for both teams, check.  - Defending champion Spurs being favourited by the media, check.  - Superstars AND role players for both teams stepping up big time, check. (Boris Diaw was insane that series)  - Blake Griffin with a key game-losing turnover  - DeAndre Jordan goaltending Blake's potential game tying/winning shot, costing us the game.  - Spurs blowing the Clippers out (From memory I think this was the franchise's biggest playoffs loss ever at the time) (27pts)  - Chris Paul, the Clippers most impactful player in the series, gets injured in Game 7.  - Chris Paul hits insane game-winner  - Shot clock fiasco at the end of Game 7 which *definitely* gave the Clippers an advantage.  This is straight out of a fairytale."
Chris Paul just signed his 4th multiyear nba contract. Lifetime earnings from salary alone will be between $400-500M. And he makes more from endorsements than he does from the NBA.   So what does one of the highest paid individuals in the history of our planet do for a living? He bounces a ball and throws it into a hoop.
"i would say Chris Paul but he mainly chokes when he’s injured, however this year his turnovers were completely on him"
"Timberwolves, Suns, Spurs, Knicks, Nuggets, Hawks, Pistons.  PG: Chris Paul (2nd)  SG: Hamidu Diallo (5th)   SF: Michael Porter Jr (3rd)  PF: Danilo Gallinari (6th)  C: Karl-Anthony Towns (1st)  6th: Derrick Rose (4th)  7th: Doug McDermott (7th)"
"Chris Paul who missed 33% of the season and played much worse when he actually did play lol? Look at the guys who got minutes on that 2019 houston team. We relied on tucker to anchor our whole defense while you had like 4 all nba defenders by him lmao.  In 2019 Chris Paul was not huge for that team, what are you even on? Bledsoe made a all D team, so did brolo, middleton made all nba, who did what for harden that season? You’re delusional man. The season harden actually had help (2018) we shit on any version of the bucks"
Chris Paul  PG KD AD Myles Turner    That’s my five at least
"Pg: Chris Paul (all-star)  Sg: CJ McCollum  Sf: Paul George (all-star)  Pf: Kevin Durant (superstar)  C: Joel Embiid (superstar)  Bench: Ja Morant, Marcus Smart, Buddy Hield, Mikal Bridges, Harrison Barnes, Aaron Gordon, Clint Capela,"
"&gt; Players have no incentive to accept smoothing,   Yes they do.  Because the vast majority of players didn't benefit from the cap spike, One guy gets Mozgov money, a bunch of other plaeyrs get minimums.  &gt; Teams might want this for monetary purposes.  There is no monetary benefit for teams.  The amount that would be in the cap available to players is *distributed to players across the league*. That was always the plan.  The NBAPA didn't want cap smoothing because the president and vice president were Chris Paul and LeBron James, and star players can confidently expect that *they'll* get max money.  They fucked over most of the league on that one."
"Idk, I’m from Aus and when I was in high school a lot of people I knew suddenly became Clippers fans once they got Chris Paul."
"Starters:  PG: Chris Paul  SG: Paul George  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo  C: Jonas Valanciunas    for my 2nd unit, I decided to only use 2 non bench players to make this a tad bit more challenging  6th: Lonzo Ball  7th: Jordan Clarkson  8th: Myles Turner  9th: Joe Ingles  10th: Montrezl Harrell   Reserves:  Mathisse Thybulle  Doug McDermott"
"I remain convinced that Sterling was able to get away with all that horrible stuff for as long as he did simply because the Clippers were so bad year in and year out that nobody cared about *anything* having to do with them. I think what flipped everything for Sterling was when the NBA orchestrated the trade to give them Chris Paul which immediately transformed them into one of the league's best teams. That meant that now lots of people were paying attention to them for the first time, and as such it really was just a matter of time before one of Sterling's scandals captured national attention in the way all his other scandals had not.   Scandals only become big news if everyday people have a reason to care about the people involved in the scandal. In the 90s when Sterling would be in open court for being a racist slumlord the average person didn't know who he was and didn't know anything about the Clippers, so they had no reason to care about what was being alleged against him and the stories would have no traction. But when the story was about the owner of a successful franchise with title hopes and MVP candidates, then people took notice."
Chris Paul would be a great snitcher.
cause we have Chris Paul on our team .
Simmons is literally elite at passing and handling. Chris Paul would help Embiid because he's a lot better than John Wall lol
" Kyrie, AD and Chris Paul being injured in the playoffs is the most predictable thing ever. LeBron being injured is a fluke. Someone who's injured all the time being injured is something you better plan around."
Harden pulling us out of the gutter in 2019 with 2 back to back 41 and 38 point performances to tie the Warriors  Shame Chris Paul wasn’t himself that run
"Curry has three rings, all with the same team.  Lebron has had to jump ship four separate times so that he can make sure he's always surrounded by all-stars.   Still couldn't beat Devin Booker and 36 year old Chris Paul."
"PG: Chris Paul, Davion Mitchell SG: Devin Booker, Lu Dort SF: Kevin Durant, Jonathan Isaac PF: Draymond Green, Christian Wood C:   Joel Embiid, Al Horford"
"The list of all-time WS leaders is nowhere near the consensus best players list, though.  Karl Malone, John Stockton, Dirk, KG, and Artis Gilmore are top 10 all-time in WS.   David Robinson, Neil Johnston, and Chris Paul are top 5 all-time in WS/48. The top 10 also includes Rudy Gobert.  Win shares and all those other “advanced” metrics are cheeks.   The only thing that really holds weight from a statistical standpoint IMO is pure production (PPG/RPG/APG) and key efficiency metrics (TS/rTS/Turnover Rate)"
"Zeke doesn’t belong in the conversation for top 6. He gets way too much credit for winning 2 titles, but he wasn’t an all nba player either year. When they actually won he was averaging an extremely inefficient 18 ppg and less than 9 assists with terrible defense. There’s like 30 point guards in NBA history that could’ve won 2 chips with that roster.   And before anyone tries to claim Stockton’s records are just “longevity”, Stockton didn’t start until he was 25. Chris Paul already has as many seasons as a starter and is still 5531 assists behind Stock. Also no one on this list came particularly close to Stockton’s peak assist numbers either. Fwiw most cumulative stats (Win Shares, Value over Replacement Player, RAPTOR WAR) have Stockton as the best pg ever by a large margin."
Yes. Part of the bucks struggle is lack of floor general to dominate mismatches and get the offense moving.  Jrue for all his positives is not a great floor general. Often in the nets series for example he’d see Giannis with kyrie or harris on him in the post and then call for a screen. Zach Lowe was even on his podcast yelling “why screen! The mismatch is already there just give him the ball!”. Chris paul isn’t someone who would make that kind of mistake. If he has a big man like Blake griffin on him he isn’t calling for a screen he’s abusing him. If he see kyrie or harden pick up Giannis he’s isolating that side of the floor and letting him work in the post
"Chris Paul has received a total of 9 all defense selections. He received 3 on the hornets. Regardless of if you think he deserved those 3 or not, he still deserved most of his selections."
"Chris Paul, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Clint Capela.  Plus defenders in every role, 4 3-level scorers.  Everybody can pass and shoot outside the best role player C in Capela."
They just won a championship without Chris Paul and beat Chris Paul.
Not at all. The Bucks are better with Jrue than they would be with Chris Paul.
"No.  I genuinely think Chris Paul, while still being a great player, is being a bit overrated."
My unpopular opinion is the Lakers won’t be half as good as everyone thinks this year so I already favor them over the Lakers.  Not the Nets though even with Chris Paul.
Great on ball defender. There was on western conference series Clippers Vs Thunder and Chris Paul locked up Kevin Durant for multiple late game possessions
Yeah no shit because their best player in Chris Paul was injured in the first round.
"You’re right, but aside from him it’s going to be interesting possibly seeing more older players stay in the league because of advancements in sports medicine, and just more money to pay for everything to keep a dude healthy. A player like Joe Johnson has the mind to compete at the highest level, which is a rare commodity. If dudes at 35+ can stay healthy (Chris Paul) there’s huge value in what they have between the ears. It’s gonna be fun seeing how this evolves."
You must be young because Isah has a finals mvp and won 2 chips during the MJ era. Chris Paul just hasn’t done anything quite on his level.
Yeah like this one. Others ive had over the yrs.   Ben Simmons-JaDeveon Clowney  Blake Griffin--Tony Romo  Chris Paul--Phillip Rivers  Lamar Jackson--Allen Iverson  Ja Morant--Kyler Murray  Jimmy Butler--Richard Sherman  Draymond Green--Donta Hightower  Kevin Garnett--Ed Reed  Rob Gronkowski--Shaq  Kyle Lowry--Steve Smith  Dirk Nowitzki--Antonio Gates
Chris Paul and winning.
"It’s absolutely wild that Wade, perhaps Lebron’s chief rival in his generation, was more or less washed as a superstar by 2013, and lebron went on to play basically ANOTHER decade as the leagues best player.  Actually, of guy’s more or less in Lebron’s generation (mid-late 30s now,) literally only Chris Paul has matched his longevity. Meanwhile, Wade, Bosh, Melo, Dwight et all haven’t been close to all stars in YEARS."
Chris Paul doesn't have the games played though. He has missed 10+ games in a season 7 times. Stockton missed 5+ games in a season one time
And Chris Paul not playing + shit refs
"Lol super lame comment it sounds like you care about everything else besides what he does on the court. Playing ""dirty"" is not right but Nitpicking about him bringing up the ball slowly is stupid. Idk how chris paul makes the game less fun have you seen the way he runs the pick and roll and his mid range game."
I think Chris Paul is getting there.
"Serious question: what about it makes it an offensive foul? Shaq doesn't lower his shoulder and he doesn't extend his arm to push off. He just takes a dribble and dunks it. Mutombo gets knocked back, but that's simply because of the difference in mass between the two, rather than because Shaq does anything which would constitute a foul. Should a player be punished because they're so much bigger and stronger than a defender?   Like let's pretend this is two different players but the exact same move is made. Let's say Chris Paul receives the ball in the post and he's being guarded by Giannis and Chris Paul takes a single dribble towards the basket with Giannis pushed up on him defending him. CP3 doesn't lower his shoulder or push off with his arms and Giannis doesn't move back at all from Chris Paul's contact. Are you still calling for an offensive foul to be called? I doubt it. You're only calling for one in this case cause Shaq is so big that he can make a perfectly legal move and his defender isn't strong enough to hold his position so it's an effective move for Shaq."
"Enes Kanter has all the tools to play defense.  Chris Paul does not.  It's not just about body, but also BBIQ and instincts as well as effort. MPJ is bad at all those."
"No it was just guards really. Chris Paul, Booker and Dame Hunted him"
In 2019? Would be like adding Chris Paul and LeBron to the Steph/KD warriors.   I remember when that happened and it was the most surefire bet in all of sports that year. The 04 Lakers were as hated as the 2011 Heat for how much they stacked the deck. But because they lost it changes the narrative over time.  Now I know the Lebron/Malone comp will incite some people but I can't think of a better comparsion. Malone was a 2x MVP averaging 20/9 at the age of 39. I think his 1999 MVP was the oldest ever. Can't pass as well as Lebron but there are very few dudes playing today that have ever been as good as Malone. And LeBron and Kareem are basically the only who have played as we into their late 30s.  CP3 = Payton is pretty self explanatory.
Disagree a fair bit with the last stretch of ur list.   1. KD 2. Giannis 3. Steph 4. Bron 5. Kawhi 6. Harden  7. Jokic 8. Embiid 9. Luka 10. Dame 11. AD 12. PG 13. Kyrie  14. Trae 15. Tatum  16. Jimmy Butler 17. Chris Paul 18. Donavan Mitchell  19. KAT  20. Zion  21. Bam 22. Booker  23. Lavine 24. Beal 25. Gobert  26. Shai 27. Middleton 28. Russ  29. Jaylen Brown 30. De’aaron Fox
"Harden is a career 43% shooter in the playoffs 33% from 3, both are markedly lower than his regular season stats.  He's had good teams, one that was good enough to take the Warriors 7 games despite him playing horribly, that they probably would have won if he showed up and if Chris Paul didn't get hurt.  (He shot 41% from the field and 24% from three over that series)."
"I mean, it’s CP3, how fearless you gotta be?  What’s he gonna do, call 911?  “Help, police! Chris Paul tryna beat me up!”"
"I love Chris Paul tantrums.  I know he's taller than most people, but compared to everyone else, he just looks like a toddler having a tantrum out there lmao."
"If I played in the NBA, I will definitely punch Chris Paul. The ejection and/or the suspension will be so worth it. That's why I'm a Rondo fan for life."
"10.5 career apg after 1500+ games is remarkable. He was easily averaging ~13-14 apg in his prime. To put into perspective how remarkable that is, Chris Paul, another all-time great PG and passer is at 9.4 career apg after 1090 games. His average could dip down to a flat 9.0 or even lower when its all said and done depending when that day will come  Magic Johnson has the highest career apg at 11.2 which is only 0.7 higher but he played 600 less games.  After 900 games (magics total games played), Stockton had a career apg of 11.5 up to that point. The craziest part is he wasnt even the fulltime starting PG till his 4th year. Truly remarkable"
"Except that Chris Paul is in his late fucking 30s, so yeah, it actually makes a lot of sense for people to start questioning when his drop off will occur. Sorry if it bothers you, but it’s totally reasonable for people to predict a drop off for a 6’ non-freak athlete PG with an injury history as he enters his later 30s. It’s dope that Tom Brady and LeBron James have defied all historical precedent of athlete aging at their sport/experience level but that doesn’t apply to everyone."
Middleton helped more than I realized. He wasn't coming to break up a fight between the players... he too was blocking Chris Paul from Scott Foster.
"Especially last year he didn’t seem as whiny until the finals. I watched it most of the playoffs for the first time in a while and truly enjoyed the way the suns played. Not something I’ve ever said about a cp3 led team.  But then they got to the finals and they were the worst. Giannis and the bucks were so classy and played their hearts out. Then I hated Chris Paul again. Now I’m kinda fuck Chris Paul, idc if he never gets a ring. It is more valuable to win one where you’re a key component, but maybe it’s karma that’s keeping him one step away. Idk."
"Lmao at the final scene, Chris Paul really be arguing with the refs even in an All Star game"
Ok that’s ridiculous. But nick Wright keeps harping on how josh Allen sucks when he doesn’t anymore or how Chris Paul was the mvp which was just ridiculous.
2016 when he averaged 30/11/8. Between the Chris Paul trade and after Dwight had left
"Chris Paul, avowed pumpkin spice fiend, confirmed."
Hello 911? Can you send Bobby Portis as fast as you can? Chris Paul is trying to beat me up!
"Seriously, to say that the people who wanted him to win don't watch basketball is ridiculous.   Chris paul is one of the most talented and competitive players I've seen in my lifetime and I personally would have loved to see him finally get a title while he still has something to give."
I love it because Chris Paul punks people ALL THE TIME so it's good to see someone doing that same kinda thing back to him. Just laughing in his face.
chris paul will soon be cliff paul
If the Blazers don't come together and look like an at least dark horse contender that may change.  I'm rooting for Dame to retire a Blazer but it is also very clear he wants to at least complete for a championship. Look how stoked Chris Paul was to just play in the finals after all these years.   Dame has several years left of high level play but he and the Blazers are on the clock.
"I think considering his injury, Kawhi is definitely one who may begin regressing. I see a lot of people saying Chris Paul, but he's already begun his regression as a player."
"&gt; Everyone says that about Chris Paul every year  And if you'd actually look at how he's performed year over year, he's been regressing for a few years.  Regressing doesn't necessarily mean a player is bad.  Regressing means that they aren't as good as they used to be.  That's Chris Paul over the last 3-4 years.  Again, that doesn't mean he's bad or anything, but it's undeniable that he's been regressing for a while.  I think the benefit of Phoenix is that they have a role for him that fits his regression as a player. OKC had a similar role for him too.  He didn't need to be ""the"" guy most of the time."
Rubio was balling out for the Suns in the bubble. His only flaw was not being as good as Chris Paul.
Preach.  I’ve got Chris Paul and Patrick Beverley as 1A and 1B on my list of players I can’t wait to see retire ringless
Everyone says that about Chris Paul every year
"LeBron, Chris Paul (this has been happening for a few years, I think his Phoenix and OKC roles just better suited his regression as his role didn't ask as much of him).  I think Butler will still be a great player but I do he will fall off a bit.  I just don't like the idea of a 30 something (even though 32 isn't that old) that can't shoot the ball well aging gracefully.  It's not Westbrook levels of bad but I think his lack of jump shooting will continue to hurt his game as he ages."
"Every so often, some young fella comes along and asks if Chris Paul has a chance at John Stockton's assists record. Hilarious."
"Imagine you’re a Warriors fan. Imagine you just endured everything just laid out these past 35 years. Imagine you didn’t trust your owners, your front office, anybody. Imagine they just traded your most entertaining player for an injury-prone center who can’t play, and imagine knowing that you can’t sign anyone else for two more summers because Biedrins and Jefferson have clogged your cap like a freshman dorm toilet. Imagine you have some of the best fellow fans in the league, only you rarely if ever have a chance to cheer anything. Imagine hearing that, after months and months of Chris Paul rumors and Dwight Howard rumors and “PLAYOFFS! PLAYOFFS! PLAYOFFS!” rhetoric, your team just abruptly told you, “Oh, by the way, we’re going to tank the rest of this season because we don’t want to be haunted by a stupid trade from four years ago, but seriously, thanks for paying for season tickets this year.”  That’s why we booed."
That Chris Paul is likable.
"Okay let's see(in no particular order):  1. Lebron 2. KD 3. Curry 4. Giannis 5. Jokic 6. Embiid 7. Kawhi 8. Paul George 9. Harden 10. Doncic 11. AD 13. Butler 14. Donovan Mitchell 15. Trae Young 16. Chris Paul 17. D Booker 18. Jason Tatum 19. Damian Lillard  I guess I'd have him at 20, because everyone else I think of is either a bit young and unproven(Morant) or debatable(Bradley Beal)."
Even top 25 is silly. That’s d wade or Chris Paul or dirk level.
Top 3 point guard? LOL get out of here. I can list a couple that are DEFINITELY and NO DOUBT better than Trae:  James Harden Chris Paul Stephen Curry Damian Lillard Luka Doncic Kyle Lowry    Now which 4 are you kicking out to put Trae as top 3? LOL
Kd was right tho.  Warriors should’ve went to a bunch of Curry-kd p&amp;r vs the rockets. The off-ball stuff wasn’t working at all.  If the rockets could’ve managed to shoot a measly 27% from 3 in game 7 they would’ve beat the best core ever without Chris Paul.
"Was trying to name 20 point guards or ""combo"" guards better than him all time. Could only get to 18.      Stephen Curry   Chris Paul   John Stockton   Jason Kidd   Steve Nash   Allen Iverson   Dwyane Wade   Isiah Thomas   Magic Johnson   Russell Westbrook   James Harden   Damian Lillard   Gary Payton   Jerry West   Oscar Robertson   Walt Frazier   Bob Cousy   Nate Archibald"
"Rubio is one of the most underrated players in the NBA. He gets overly knocked for his most apparent limitations, but his game has steadily improved over time. He’s an elite teammate and super smart player. It cannot be overstated how much his presence elevated the Suns the year before Chris Paul. Warms my heart to see him balling out."
"Here’s how it goes  The hornets were created in 1988 and they were originated in Charlotte   In 2002, they relocated to New Orleans and kept the name. The Chris Paul jersey comes from this team  In 2004, Charlotte got a new team named the bobcats  In 2013, the New Orleans Hornets changed their name to the New Orleans Pelicans we know today  In 2014, the Charlotte bobcats changed their name to the Charlotte hornets we know today  The Charlotte Hornets/Bobcats also reclaimed the old Charlotte Hornets history from 1989-2002 although that’s technically the pelicans history"
"LeBron, Steph, KD, Harden (offered), Jimmy Butler, Kyle Lowry, Chris Paul, Jrue, amongst however many others just in the past year or two."
"I’m right lmao. We own our history from 2003-the present. Chris Paul is a part of our franchise. The only thing that changed was the name. The Bobcats changed their name back to the Hornets when we changed our name, and we gave them back their history of their time in Charlotte before they moved to NOLA, which means that the NOLA hornets are the Pelicans. All you have to do is look it up lol."
"Chris Paul, near 50/40/90 efficiency, Mid range god, elite defender especially in his prime, and obviously one of the best passers ever."
Chris paul nola jersey would be the hornets.
Chris Paul being injured was a pretty big deal
"LeBron, Shaq, Steph, KD, Kobe, Duncan, Iverson,  Dirk, KG, Giannis, James Harden, Dame, Westbrook, Chris Paul, Kawhi, Wade, Nash, Dwight, Carmelo,  Pierce, Jason Kidd,Ray Allen,  Tmac    And that's only counting the players that hit their crimes in the 2000s and up lol"

"Thunder had Chris Paul that year, it’s not like he had any other choice but to play a bench role."
Chris Paul has aged like fine wine… a fine wine that was traded with frp’s for westbrook smh
"I mean I'll take the AI vs jason kidd argument and maybe even oscar robertson but I don't like to compare completely different eras like that.  AI vs jason kidd and chris paul are more appropriate. and chris paul I would say is better as a pure point guard, but AI might be more skilled.  it's a tough one but I'd rather have chris paul as I won't have to build a team around him.  AI is more surround with shooters and defenders type player instead of plug and play like chris paul which makes him more valuable. (jason kidd is the same chris paul type but less imo)  kyrie however is below all of these people unless he gets his shit together.  Like I get the sentiment and he very well could have been better than a lot of them but just was a bitch instead."
"We've made moves that prioritize the future rather than the play in. We have a good coach, young talent, and a fun roster. We've also revived Chris Paul and Al Horford's careers along the way. Mike Muscala literally sat half of last season with us and then signed a 2 year contract because he enjoyed it so much. This is, according to the media, a slap in the face of the NBA.  Apparently tHe rIgHt wAy tO pLaY is to hire clearly bad coaches for multiple seasons, sign bloated contracts, and mishandle your young talent to the point that they publicly force their way out in the 2nd year of their 5 year deals."
"I get what you said, and I agree in that I wouldn't put his passing ability anywhere near his shooting.   Those two stats don't tell a story of how good Curry is compared to the rest of the people on the list, as he's the primary ball hander, and scorer, and a lot of other people on that list (with the exception of the bloody anomaly Chris Paul) are not.   What they do show however, is that he is not ""careless"" with his passing. Which is what you said."
OP is just some Chris Paul stan who really shouldnt being trying to celebrate with the Suns fandom if he's gonna post this shit.
Chris Paul can’t do this btw
"Every time Chris Paul gets the friendly bounce, you drink.   Spoiler: You're drunk"
"I don’t really like “playmaker” in that sense. I just think it’s guard, wing, big and any of those can be your playmaker I.e. chris Paul, Lebron, or Jokic respectively. Lamelo is just a big playmaking guard, not a wing"
Bbiq chris Paul
"Oscar Robertson... Jason Kidd... Chris Paul...  The fact that Iggy has AI ahead of all of these guys is already insulting, but he has that AI2 bias I guess. Kyrie on that list? Cmon now"
"Hello I can answer this for you. He lost his next two finals appearances, then missed the yoffs, then won a Mickey mouse ring in the bubble while KD is injured, the only guy that has been stopping Lebrons rings recently. Then gets eliminated to old ass Chris Paul in 1st round. I mean that ain't my goat. He going downhill."
"Chris Paul, the wisest of them all"
and once again he fucked the Rockets with that shot because we ended up trading Chris Paul and draft picks for Westbrook.
I think the last real fight in NBA was Chris Paul-Rajon Rondo when he spit in his face. They swinged for real.
That's so awesome my first live game I can remember was when the Grizzlies played the then New Orleans hornets and Chris Paul fucking killed them. I've always had a natural inclination towards Chris Paul
"I know there's Logan Paul, Sean Paul, Aaron Paul, Jake Paul, Rich Paul, and Chris Paul.  I think Logan and Aaron are the YouTubers but honestly you could tell me it was Jake too. Definitely wouldn't recognize any of those three."
Chris Paul
Don't jinx Chris Paul.

Chris paul was cursed by a monkey paw lol.
"I believe as great as Lillard and Chris Paul are, they shouldn’t have been on that list."
"Would've been a huge upgrade to the roster and possibly a ring.   35 year old CP3 took Phoenix to the finals, and players like Lowry and Chris Paul bring more than just shooting or passing."
Traded Chris Paul for Westbrook because he said Paul had the worst contract. Traded Westbrook for Wall because he thought Westbrook had a worse contract. This guy just doesn’t know basketball at all. Hate having him as an owner. Been boycotting all his restaurants for a few years now and it’s been glorious.
"You obviously didn't haha Chris Paul took the pj tuckers of the world literally all season, including playoffs you dummy"
"Honestly considering the pelicans wouldn’t let AD play, and Luke Walton is still a coach in the nba there’s not really a precedent for a commissioner for a team to do anything unless it’s really blatant or related to Chris Paul"
"If you’re the worst defender among Chris Paul, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, and DeAndre Ayton, that doesn’t really say a ton tbh, you could range from pretty good to atrocious. Booker is closer to the pretty good end."
"There is literally no valid reason to not play him.   He wants to play, I'm sure of that.   He can help the young guys develop (and they'd still lose of their concern is lottery odds).   And what's more, if he plays well, teams might actually perk up and take an interest in him.   Part of the reason teams are hesitant is because they are unsure how well he can play following his injury, and last year wasn't much of a sample size.   The first year back from an injury like that is spotty. Look at Hayward.   But if he comes out there and is playing D and making plays, and shooting .350 from the arc, then great.   Look what happened with Chris Paul. The Rockets dumped him on OKC thinking nobody would want that contract, and BAM! The Suns are trading for him and then give him an extension that nobody thought was possible 12 months, hell, even a month before.   &amp;#x200B;  I'm not saying I'd expect as much from Wall. But worst case scenario, he's not great and the team still sucks, and they are in the same boat. Best case scenario, he plays like an All-Star a guy and there are teams who will take on his contract"
"just look at Chris Paul shooting threes vs midrange. With threes he shoots it at the beginning of his jump and with the mid he shoots at the top of his jump and with more lift. He changes the timing and motion of his jumpshot according to the two distances.  If you look at like DeRozan he keeps the same form which doesn't have much arc and relies more on his arm/wrist because he shoots at the top of his jump, so given the distance increase makes it much less consistent for him"
"Non-prior-informed RAPM can be noisy. It needs a big sample size. 4 seasons is pretty good, but maybe he still got some favorable luck. And there's still the issue of the sample containing only his peak and not his later career.  Barring issues of collinearity and random noise, these RAPM numbers are ""correct"" - actual real answers of how impactful people were.  &gt; insane amounts of outliers  Are you sure? The list looks pretty reasonable. Of the large sample size players, ""Lebron, KG, Chris Paul, Steph Curry, Tim Duncan"" is a very reasonable top 5.  And when you disagree - how can you tell the difference between an outlier and somebody actually providing this level of impact? The eye test can be deceiving, and on average I'm more inclined to trust the numbers than trust you."
These new metrics are like rabbits. What's this one now? Testicles Punched Average? Is he the new Chris Paul?
"It's not just Chris Paul tho. Rubio started the turnaround from a very bad team to a decent team. Obviously OP isn't comparing Rubio to CP3. But a good player with a steady hand made a difference with a young team. Rubio is an assist first PG which was something we were missing for years.  Again CP3 obviously helped even more, but it undersells the rest of a young team getting older and having consistent culture and coaching. Mikal found his role, Booker took another step toward superstardom, and Ayton had a full, consistent season.    I made [this post in the suns sub going into a bunch of the changes over the course of a season or two](https://np.reddit.com/r/suns/comments/ms4ku3/what_has_changed/)"
"You're really underselling Chris Paul. He's not some under the radar scrappy veteran, he's one of the absolute greatest players in the history of the sport. He made an All NBA 2nd team the season before getting to Phoenix and another one with Phoenix. Who exactly do you propose Minnesota should get in that vein? And didn't they just get the quintessential player you're describing in Patrick Beverley?"
To be fair he averaged 18 and 12 without Chris Paul in his second year. It wasn’t a full season but he can still be successful without him. But the Wolves wouldn’t do that trade because they can probably get more from another team.
watching ayton play without chris paul 🤮
"Frank and McGee have been great in his absence. Just like Capela, DeAndre Jordan and Tyson Chandler. Wow Chris Paul is so lucky with his big men. Kaminsky and Ayton should definitely get the max"
"The nuggets radio play by play guy is my favorite. He’s fully integrated bitching about the refs into his commentary. Like if they’re playing the suns he’ll be like “Chris paul drives in, ayton sets a moving screen, bridges sets a moving screen too but they don’t call it, paul scores.” It’s like second nature to him lol"

"&gt; rich mans chris paul  No, he really wouldn't. And if you adjust for pace, Nash has better stats."
NBA has a funny way of suddenly starting to value what a player does later in the years. Take Nash's MVP seasons and compare them to Stockton's best years and that's even before you consider pace. Stockton would be a rich mans chris paul in today's NBA. And likely averaging 15 assists per game give or take.
Idk man Chris Paul has a defensive advantage it's impossible to score on a dude with such pretty eyes
Same place as Chris Paul imo
The Chris Paul special
" How lucky is Chris Paul with his big men? Had a dominant Tyson Chandler, Deandre Jordan, Clint Capela, and now Ayton, McGee, and Frank on one team! They all deserve maxes"
"Oh no, jordan played in 95. You tried tho LOL  Pathetic, bron kills your team in 15 with kyrie (was already up 2-1 with delly lmfao let alone love injured) 17 with Kawhi (beating your ass until kd and Steph needed a teammate to save the day and injure kawhi) and 18 when houston had you beat 3-2 and Chris Paul couldn’t play the last 2 games. Oh, that wasn’t enough, you still needed refs too."
"Chris Paul are the reason Devin Booker in the finals. Remove Paul, Booker would be in the trashcan again"
"Yeah, against the greatest team probably ever assembled. Any team in history would've lost to that team probably, so I don't think it proves his point really. And without Chris Paul. So like, come on"
"**Not necessarily in order:**  1. Steph Curry 2. Luka Doncic  3. James Harden 4. Damian Lillard 5. Trae Young  6. Chris Paul  7. Kyrie Irving 8. Ja Morant  9. Jrue Holiday 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Jamal Murray 12. LaMelo Ball 13. Ben Simmons  14. De'Aaron Fox 15. Russell Westbrook 16. Kyle Lowry 17. Mike Conley 18. Fred VanVleet 19. Malcolm Brogdon  Honestly, it's a close-run thing for DLo to make the top 20. There's still the likes of Darius Garland, Dejounte Murray, Lonzo Ball and Spencer Dinwiddie to consider."
So you're saying they need Chris Paul?
"I agree. I mean, Jordan was good, but he benefited playing next to really great players. If he wasn’t fed lobs from Chris Paul for 2/3s of his career, he wouldn’t have done anywhere near as much"
"I like Donovan Mitchell over Luka for starting backcourt right now.  Luka has great numbers but his efficiency is poor.  I know he basically has to do everything himself, but I think he's actually struggled so far.  I don't see a good case for him over Mitchell right now other than reputation.  That being said, it's so early in the season still...   Edit:  or maybe Chris Paul.  I would have them both over struggling Doncic at this point."
You can't tell me you looked at Chris Paul defending Deandre Hunter and thought Trae was wrong.
So you're saying they should trade DLo for Chris Paul
"lmao you were down 3-2 and you needed the refs *and* chris paul not playing to barely squeak a 9 point win. it was rigged, everyone saw it. funny how much help steph needs. getting lucky in 2015 with kyrie 2017 with kawhi 2018 with cp.  2019 our team was ass outside of harden, ill agree. but harden outplayed your boy steph easily and kd while on the worse team lmaoo"
"i’d be the white chris paul, if chris paul was profoundly bad at basketball"
Not sure actually. Only suspension I could find was for kicking Chris Paul and ending his active streak
Chris Paul snaking a PnR and keeping his guy in jail for an eternity while DJ rolls to the rim putting the opposing big in mental jail is burned into my head of the Lob City era.
Chris Paul
"&gt; Monty Williams wanted to challenge Devin Booker's seventh foul (last night), turning to his staff for an opinion. Chris Paul, on his ass after falling down on the play, tapped his hands together acknowledging Book ""hit his hand"". Suns did not challenge the foul."
"We had Chris Paul, AD, and Jrue for years. Eventually most players will leave, so those were bad examples.  Randle signed a 1 year deal there to replace Boogie and we let him walk when we knew we were picking Zion, because they play the same position and neither can effectively play another one. Another bad example.  Christian Wood Barry played with us, and we waived him. Another bad example.  Pelicans could’ve brought Lonzo back if they wanted to, but decided to sign and trade him instead. That was the Pelicans decision, not Lonzo’s, so another bad example.  We literally extended JV before the season so that doesn’t even make sense.  Zion has lots of years left, and the Pelicans may want to trade Zion before Zion even wants to be traded with the way things are looking.  BI said he wants to be here and is behaving that way, plus he has multiple years left on his deal.  I could say Philly is a farm team because AI, Barkley, Jimmy Butler, Al Horford, Jrue Holiday, Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, and JJ Redick all left.  Also, Ben Simmons is about to leave.  Also, Joel Ennius will force us way out after you fail  to put enough talent around him and get eliminated early in the playoffs again.  Tobias Harris will probably want out after that too.  Let’s just play it safe and say Tyrese Maxey will want out after that as well.  How did that post even get this many upvotes? 🤦"
but its chris paul so things balanced out
I mean OP mentioned Chris Paul who hasnt even been with the team since 2010-2011 (more than 10 years ago) so it seems like fair game.
Chris Paul was top ten in the entire NBA in technicals last year…you’re making stuff up
"Yeah Harden has almost played like more of a Chris Paul in terms of role(capable of efficient scoring, but always looking to pass first)"
"People were getting upvoted like crazy when Beverley pushed CP3 last year saying the same shit. I get the Beverley one was super dirty and different than Jokic retaliating, but I couldn't sit there and agree with people claiming Chris Paul could have died. You can call something dirty without making it felony attempted murder."
Chris Paul IIRC
I swear Chris Paul was wearing them in one of the Finals games.
Did you completely skip over the playoffs last season? Chris Paul was out and then decided to play with a contusion that continued to bother him the rest of the playoffs.
He called Chris Bosh the Ru Paul of big men after bullying him! I was big mad back in the day lol
"Chris Paul, just ask Austin Rivers"
So you agree Chris Paul is a dirty player that takes shots outside of basketball plays? Dafuq you arguing then?
Did I say he did? Chris Paul is a dirty player or “scummy” as you say and he’s on the suns.
When did Chris Paul drop his shoulder into someone’s back after a play? I’ve been sleeping
They have Chris Paul. Dafuq you talking about?
[I heard Chris Paul tried to instigate shit w the Clippers that one time. ](https://youtu.be/UzQP7u-IOxg)
"&gt;*Ok so no legitimate reasons, just your feels. Noted.*  1. No city is a basketball city till you make it a basketball city 2. Because a bunch of randos on reddit maybe don't understand why but the NBA/Silver/Local owner think it can have a future 3. In a majority-black city with a prominent culture and identity, it's not too wild to think basketball could become a successful enjoyable part of the city sport expierence! 4. The right franchise player can inspire a lot of love from a city! If someone shows NOLA love, it'll love them back. It's always been that way. We fucking loved Chris Paul during his time here. 5. Oh!

"Forgot to add, here's a longer version of the first table with the 50 biggest connections. I think Tim Duncan/ Tony Parker are the only pair that show up on both sides of this:  | Shooter | Assister | Number of assists | |:------:|:------:|:------:| | Karl Malone | John Stockton | 1572 | | Tim Duncan | Tony Parker | 1533 | | Kevin Durant | Russell Westbrook | 1466 | | Blake Griffin | Chris Paul | 1157 | | Amar'e Stoudemire | Steve Nash | 1155 | | Marc Gasol | Mike Conley | 1121 | | David West | Chris Paul | 1120 | | Klay Thompson | Stephen Curry | 962 | | Richard Hamilton | Chauncey Billups | 934 | | Richard Jefferson | Jason Kidd | 890 | | Kevin Garnett | Rajon Rondo | 878 | | Carlos Boozer | Deron Williams | 834 | | Shawn Marion | Steve Nash | 823 | | Allen Iverson | Eric Snow | 812 | | Steven Adams | Russell Westbrook | 809 | | Bradley Beal | John Wall | 797 | | Dirk Nowitzki | Steve Nash | 797 | | Antawn Jamison | Gilbert Arenas | 790 | | Ray Allen | Rajon Rondo | 787 | | Zydrunas Ilgauskas | LeBron James | 785 | | Stephen Curry | Draymond Green | 776 | | Serge Ibaka | Russell Westbrook | 774 | | Anthony Davis | Jrue Holiday | 770 | | Clint Capela | James Harden | 760 | | Vince Carter | Jason Kidd | 760 | | Dirk Nowitzki | Jason Kidd | 753 | | Dirk Nowitzki | Jason Terry | 744 | | Mehmet Okur | Deron Williams | 740 | | Marcin Gortat | John Wall | 735 | | Paul Pierce | Rajon Rondo | 727 | | Shaquille O'Neal | Kobe Bryant | 727 | | Tony Parker | Tim Duncan | 713 | | Juwan Howard | Rod Strickland | 711 | | Udonis Haslem | Dwyane Wade | 702 | | Clifford Robinson | Jason Kidd | 694 | | Tim Duncan | Manu Ginóbili | 672 | | Klay Thompson | Draymond Green | 668 | | Paul Pierce | Antoine Walker | 666 | | Jermaine O'Neal | Jamaal Tinsley | 648 | | Josh Smith | Joe Johnson | 636 | | Glenn Robinson | Sam Cassell | 633 | | J.J.

"'I have 2 words; Steve Nash and Chris Paul, must watch TV'"
Would be truly shit for it to be a multi-game when Pay Bev only got 1 for shoving the shit out of Chris Paul with no provocation.
It’s kind of insane that this is happening to a Chris Paul team again.
To be fair - Chris Paul is dirty as hell too so he probably deserved it lol
"What no, that's not a thing. There's people in that thread claiming westbrook is better than morant, mitchell,chris paul, jure."
"I never said that I think Jokic *should* get more games, I just think that he will. His push was after the dead ball, and I wouldn't be surprised to see the league punish that kind of action harder than a play that happened during a live ball that the Heat could argue was just a hard foul. Personally, I think you should put both of them out for a similar time, but I am just expecting Jokic to get at least one game longer than Morris.  However, as somebody else pointed out in response to my comments, Patrick Beverley was only suspended one game after he pushed Chris Paul in the back during the playoffs last post season, so they could both realistically just get one game since there is some recent precedence to this sort of thing."
"i mean i don't think he's chris paul, but, to your point, he's slow and white... if he didn't have high-level BBIQ he would've never had the career he had"
Chris Paul
"I thought I was the only one who noticed this shit, in the WCF they would give the switch on Chris Paul for zubac and Paul would just shoot right over him and made the mid range shot LITERALLY EVERY TIME lmfao"
Not really. Chris Paul was naturally getting older in age and he actually averaged more ppg and just one less assists  Russ went down but he honestly played better and his ppg went up by 5   KD also ofc massively benefitted from playing with a playmaker like Harden and Harden sacrificed his stats so that Kyrie and KD could beast
"'Mid' range is a very vague term that varies in definition from person to person. I include floater range because that also requires a ton of touch to land shots with, and is outside of layup range.   If you simply search by 2 pt *jumpshots*, the list is basically the exact same, with Jokic at 51%, Chris Paul at 48, and then a bunch of people at 44-46%."
"I don't think he's making it. Steph Curry and Luka Doncic will start at the guards. The reserve spots will be Devin Booker, Chris Paul, Donovan Mitchell, &amp; Paul George.   If you consider Paul George a SF, then Anthony Edwards should fill that reserve spot.  Only way he's making it is if there are multiple injuries."
"I know Chris Paul and Devin Booker absolutely feasted in the PnR last year. That wasn't because Jokic was gassed. Your metrics don't mean shit when playoff games come down to who defends a PnR the best. Like I said, maybe a Jokic led offense can be better than what he gives up on defense, but until I see it he will always be a tier below the top guys."
"I don't think he's making it. Steph Curry and Luka Doncic will start at the guards. The reserve spots will be Devin Booker, Chris Paul, Donovan Mitchell, &amp; Paul George.  If you consider Paul George a SF, then Anthony Edwards should fill that reserve spot.  Only way he's making it is if there are multiple injuries."
"It's a tough battle between him and the immortal CP3, the assist to turnover ratio of Chris Paul is just insane, the guy looks like Aaron Rodgers out there, pure execution with little to no mistakes. 10 assists with 2 turnovers... it's inhuman, even Stockton, Nash and Kidd got close to 3 turnovers, but CP commits 1 less (and you can imagine my disgust to have WestBrook in my favorite team)"
"Chris Paul going down in the WCF against the Warriors, probably.  If he's healthy we probably win and don't break up the band and trade for Westbrook, which obviously would have altered the course of the team and Harden would likely still be here."
We survived Chris Paul and harden. I think we can survive this
I forgive Kevin Durant and Chris Paul
"That’s because Chris Paul is a top three midrange shooter ever and Devin Booker is very good as well.   The fact that it’s a better percentage shot is meaningless unless it’s a down-to-the-wire, must-score possession. In the aggregate, you’re going nowhere if you take more midrange shots than threes."
I don’t even think it’s fair to put Dame and Steph head on in a comparison.  Dame is closer to the Houston Harden/Luka/Chris Paul/Westbrook school of top-of-key creator than he is to Steph. Steph’s approach to the game is fundamentally different than any other top flight point guard.
"Pelinka, Cuban, Ballmer they're all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that one's on top and on and on it spins crushing those beneath it. Chris Paul isn't going to stop the wheel, he's going to break the wheel."
"Chris Paul has the god given talent to take all the credit for team accomplishments which reduces the credit Devin Booker gets. It happened when he was on the Thunder too. There was no talk of SGA, Schroder, Gallo, or Adams on big sports media outlets. Just CP3 “carrying” the Thunder like he’s the only reason they had any success at all last year."
"Chris Paul has never choked to the Warriors  He beat them in 2014 with averages of 17/5/9 with 3 steals on 56% TS and 22/14 with 4 steals on 64% TS in the game 7  2018 he's alot worse and older and playing second fiddle to Harden but still puts up a respectable 20/7/5 with 2 steals tho on only 52% TS. However, with Harden going like 5/21 or smth in that game 5 they don't win without CP3   2019 was the only year he was bad but he was just washed that entire year and he came alive in game 6 despite losing"
Chris Paul only choked vs. the Warriors once(2019) when he looked washed all year lol  Not sure why there's a narrative about him being the guy who lost to Steph every time when he beat him in 2014 and was up 3-2 before getting hurt in 2018
Sheesh Warriors are battle tested at this point.   But Suns are new to this.   I feel like Chris Paul choking vs the Warriors yet again is going to be the X factor
If Steph crosses Chris Paul again. Im gonna lose it.
"Or more improbably, Chris Paul"
Whatever it is Chris Paul will be first
"I hate this myth about players not being able to hit another level after 29/30. It’s just simply not true anymore especially with guards. Nash, Curry, Chris Paul and Lowry have all shown you can play very much into your mid 30s at a very high level and even improve aspects of your game at this age. Kemba could have easily been one of them without the injuries especially because he was finally going to experience deep playoff runs for the first time."
If they’re not an elite playmaker or defender yeah. But guys like Chris Paul Gobert and dray can still make it despite scoring numbers because of how dominant they are in other areas of the game
Chris Paul over Trae for All-NBA first team is a crime
"Chris Paul became the first player in NBA history to cross 20k points 10k assists. If/when he crosses it, Lebron will have 30k points 10k assists.   Just insane to think about"
"I love that he was on fire because of his disappointment from the year before, fucking love the comeback story. I'm hoping Chris Paul goes ultra instinct this year and just melts everyone to the chip channeling the point god. But I'm afraid Curry is also tapping into the divine energies and their both in the western universe so only one will advance to the finals of power, not to mention Jiren Antetokounmpo"
I’m liking the “How many dirty plays does ____ need” posts. This one has less context/commentary for my liking though.   Chris Paul definitely needs one.
Harden's performances aren't that bad when you look at who he's lost to(aside from 2017 which was inexcusable)  2015 he had a very good run and just ran out of gas against the 67 win Warriors with a pretty bad team  2016 the Rockets sucked  2018 he could have done better but CP3 was injured   2019 he outplayed Curry for 5.5 games but Chris Paul(4/15 in game 5) and Capela who was awful all series kept him from winning
"Nd again a lot of ppl in this sub started watching basketball when curry won his first mvp so they wouldn’t know much about 2000s basketball the first finals the mavs and heat played was beautiful , lakers vs celtics was amazing , the iq was high and the game was just pleasing to watch , no inflated numbers &amp; 70 3s a game , that’s not appealing , that’s why I watch certain players that give me that 2000s vibe like klay , kd, kyrie , Chris Paul , devin booker,  demar , &amp; even melo at times, Lou will ,&amp; Jamal Murray , the mid range is the most deadly shot in the game , n can make you almost unstoppable if you can take it to the whole and have a respectable 3 , nothing will ever beat a two dribble pull up or one dribble pull up &amp; that’s why steph is so revered bc his doing that at the 3 point Line which is insane"
"You can't compare Steph's defense to specialists like Caruso, Lonzo, or Smart. Curry is averaging close to 30 ppg.   As far as ""two-way point guards"", no one even comes close. Even Chris Paul doesn't shoulder the offensive load Curry does.  Doncic, Lillard, Trae, Westbrook, and Morant are the only ones carrying a similar offensive load, and all of them are worst at defense than Curry."
"Curry was rattled that first year in the Finals. If Lebron (the actual best player in the league for the last 7 years) had any actual formidable team around him that year, Warriors would have been in serious trouble trying to get by on that performance from Curry. The second year in the Finals he got directly outperformed by his matchup, Kyrie. And couldn’t close out a 3-1 advantage, despite being the supposed best player in the league. And you act like he straight up chose to play worse than KD lol. That’s such a cop out. KD just flat out was the best player on that team. Think back to the Rockets Warriors matchup that went to 7 games. Hell, Chris Paul outplayed Curry in that individual matchup as well. The one consistent thing in the Warriors last two championships that no team had an answer for? Kevin Durant. That’s why he was rightfully the Finals MVP both times."
"Lol no. He’s for sure great but gtfo. The greatest offensive force of all time got rattled by Dellavodova in the fuckin Finals??? The greatest offensive force who repeatedly has gotten outperformed in the playoffs by both competitors and teammates alike? Lebron, KD, Chris Paul etc. have all had better series than him. And Lebron and Chris Paul were competing directly against him. Jeez lol. Y’all are something else with this stuff."
"You clearly don't watch the games lol. Those players go off because our guards can't contain. For instance, when Gary Harris returned to the bubble to guard Donovan Mitchell, he suddenly stopped his supernova streak. When we put a good defensive guard on the other team's best guard we suddenly did great lol. Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, and Devin booker were all guarded by our 3rd stringers..."
"Donovan Mitchell, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, Devin Booker going nuts and having historically great playoff series attacking Jokic the past 2 playoffs is probably not a coincidence."
"""Do people assume all your problems got solved because a big strong Chris Paul showed up?""  Devin Booker: ""yeah, what is up with that?"""
"Yeah, I’m a basketball noon so I rarely comment, but that surprised me as well. It seemed he was really pretty bad, and while you could argue that he needed minutes for development, those aren’t likely to be immediate impact minutes that help in the short term, so getting wiseman back seems like it probably hurts the team more than helps in terms of getting Ws in 2021.      Also… why doesn’t anyone seem to give a shit about Chris Paul? It seems like he’s maybe the best active player according to advanced stats, but nobody seems to recognize him in the same tier as Durant, Curry, etc."
"I know it isn't a popular thing to say on reddit but Chris Paul is ahead of Booker in most advanced stats.   CP3: 3.1 WS, 4.2 BPM, 4.8 EPM, 2.6 RAPTOR  Booker: 1.8 WS, 1.2 BPM, 2.8 EPM, 2.1 RAPTOR  None of these stats are 100% accurate but when someone is ahead of another player in pretty much every available stat it is more often than not a good indication that player is having a more impactful season. In any case I don't think it is crazy to have Chris Paul over Booker despite less impressive raw boxscore numbers."
"I think Chris Paul is close with Bob Iger. I remember when Chris was debating on what team to sign with in his free agency, he did some interview with Bob.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8pX_rrHpaM"
People were insane with CP3 dickriding last year lol. Give anyone else in the NBA 17 ppg and 9 assists and call them the MVP and fans will call you a lunatic. Chris Paul does it and somehow he's elevating the Suns all by himself. Like yeah the guy raises the floor but you don't win MVP for being smart with the ball
"who cares he's been ejected  Honestly, Chris Paul and Scott Foster ejecting each other would legit make the game better"
"Stockton peak was 7th in mvp voting, his longevity is also very overrated in terms of playing at a high level at an old age. Chris Paul whos been very injury prone is ageing 100x better than Stockton did"
"Hello police, Chris Paul tryna tech me up"
"He was also part of a talk/panel thing organised by the NBA a couple years ago with Barack Obama (and Chris Paul and Kevin Love). If conservatives wanted to be mad at him, there’s plenty of ammo."
Chris Paul about to become a Disney Princess
&gt; Chris Paul and Scott Foster would eject each other in the first two minutes of each game  ... honestly factual.  Simultaneous double double techs on sight
"Peak guard era, lol Are you kidding me? The 00s never happened? Kobe and Wade always clashing to see who got the first team selection (then Iverson and T-Mac before Wade surged up), PGs like the own Chris Paul, Nash, Kidd, etc.. The fact this generation overpraise a empty stat padder like WestBrook and name a long range shot alluding to Lillard instead of Curry, it shows how fans completely lost perspective. Hero ball rarely works, even Jordan struggled early, Iverson and Kobe raining bricks and so on... and you praise Lillard, of all people, because of his hero shooting? Again, get that casual shit out of here"
"I do. Being a friend of a friend doesn't equate to much. The fact they're known as someone who's close to someone who is actually close to LeBron instead of just being close to LeBron himself speaks volumes. If they were close enough to spend a lot of time with each other, he would just be close to LeBron, the Chris Paul bit wouldn't be needed here."
DJ is really close with Chris Paul who is really close with LeBron. I would doubt highly that they don't spend a lot of time together.
LMA will also be useless in the playoffs because of defense  Chris Paul destroyed him on switches
Booker has to be over Chris Paul. Book has been our most important player.
I think it would be hilarious if like the captain or one player on each team could actually do it. They could get like 3 a game.  Chris Paul and Scott Foster would eject each other in the first two minutes of each game
Chris Paul isn’t even there anymore!
Be careful because my boy Stewart may try to drop kick Chris Paul
You can blame Chris Paul for this
Chris Paul is the best player on the Suns imho.
"Like OKC Chris Paul or with y’all? I’m not the biggest CP3 fan either, I do just think he does a shit ton for the teams he plays for, even if he isn’t stereotypical 1A"
Chris Paul is not the best player on the Suns lol  Why do people believe this shit
Chris paul services
Did you catch any of 2019 Chris Paul?
Except he has. Chris Paul made it to the finals at age 36 lol
He beat a clippers team with Paul George and Terrence man. Harden had to face the fucking warriors with Chris either on the bench or playing horribly. Stop it
Chris Paul literally didn’t get past round 2 until he came here
Chris Paul before his injury was one of the most complete players in the game. He literally had his point god instincts as well as DeAaron Fox speed.  With that said peak Harden was one of the most ridiculous players in the history of the league. Harden edges out slightly.
"it is close idk what people mean by this not even close stuff lmao   07-08 and 08-09 chris paul averaged 22/5/11, 2.7 spg on 59% ts"
Chris Paul about to kick Curry off the practice court again
Chris “topher Walken” Paul
"You don't know what I'm arguing because you're only seeing the argument you wanna see. The other dude said Harden is the better playmaker compared to Chris Paul, and runs the offense better. I replied that Harden is not a better playmaker than Chris Paul, and then you came here. Playmaking is not just passing.      Also I didn't say it's not a reason you were good, just not the main one. If your main takeaway of Harden's rockets is his passing and not his scoring I don't know what to tell you honestly. His scoring enabled his passing since defenses had to account for his presence when guarding the pick &amp; Roll and actions that involved other 3 point shooters, it's easier to find passing lanes when defenses have to swarm you. This takes great passing skills, but it doesn't necessarily classify you as an elite playmaker. What you're referring to is elite ball handler, which Harden absolutely was, and we don't know if he still is.      Harden's main strengths are passing, vision and pick &amp; roll actions, but his BBIQ is just inferior compared to elite playmakers which causes him to adjust slower to different defenses than others, imo, and causes him to have dumb turnovers or just produce stagnant offense. Me preferring trae, luka and cp3 over him shouldn't be controversial either, since they're all elite playmakers. If you believe Harden is elite in that regard too, you do you, I just don't see it that way."
"Literally nobody claimed we were only good because of hardens passing.. what? The guy you replied to already said Chris Paul is the better passer. I don’t even know what you’re arguing  The rockets didn’t have a reliable secondary ball handler besides the short period chris was healthy. It was all harden. To imply his passing “isn’t remotely the reason we were that good” is fucking hilarious, plop Bradley Beal or Zach Lavine into that role and tell me hardens passing didn’t mean much   He ran point for a full season and put up 29/8/11 in houston and then in Brooklyn he put up 25/9/11 last year. I don’t know why you’re using this season as your only example lol?   Also, yes, Chris Paul is the more efficient playmaker, but not all turnovers are from passes. Peak harden was also giving you 30+ with those 10+ assists so 4-5 turnovers is justified"
Or Chris Paul
It’s cuz the lakers are losing right now and who this sub personally finds relatable and cool is 100% based on who’s currently winning. Like how Chris Paul went from point god awesome cool pg to dirty cheating bitch after the suns started losing
"Derozan has meltdowns every other playoff series for his entire run with Toronto. His ts% went from 55 to 50 in the playoffs, including 46% in 2016 when they desperately needed him to score.   I remember when the raptors and heat went head to head there were multiple games j was happy he was on the floor. He legitimately might be the worst playoffs drop for an all star, especially considering his midrange bread and better supposed to be playoff proof a la Kobe, Chris Paul, etc."
So the same clip everyone links when they want to pretend that defending behind your back is something harden actually got to play against for more then 1 possesion lol  And in some of those clips it’s against Chris Paul lmao
"Tim Duncan, Steve Nash, Bill Bradley, Chris Bosh, Paul Gasol, Draymond Green, these are all pretty intelligent NBA greats who were specifically also regarded as ""high basketball IQ"" players.  Accepting biased, anecdotal experience to make a sweeping generalization and then double-down on it despite no effort to test or substantiate the idea is the definition of a dumb, low IQ opinion. You're literally the embodiment of what you criticize."

"You know how many times I have seen people on other subbredits ask about if they can maybe trade for Ayton if he unhappy here. Even before, people have always said ""we need a switchable defensive big on this team that punishes small ball line ups on offense, like Ayton"" Every team wants a big like that and they are a rare commodity. The one thing Ayton can't do is carry an offense like a PG or a big like Giannis, Jokic, and Embiid. He is great at everything else and works amazing when you dont need that and have other ball handlers like Booker and Chris Paul."

"In retrospect for the Houston situation, Harden at the time did not seem like a great star to play with. He clashed big time with Chris Paul too."
chris paul van vleet and lowry all weigh more than cj despite being shorter. its not just about height but thats also important
Which team is a better question. When teams play box and one against you no single defender can stop you. As far as individual defenders go Dillon Brooks does a good job and Chris Paul always turns it up against Curry. Seth Curry and Avery Bradley also do pretty well. Jrue is typically a good defender but Steph always lights him up.
"Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony. All examples of superstars who had declined heavily by 32. How good you were at your peak has nothing to do with how you'll age."
"as a long time harden fan, comments like this make my blood boil so much its crazy and my response wont even do anything lol. he's barely taken a hit from those rules at this point. he averaged 25 points last season, is averaging 21 points this season. thats a 4 point drop off. keep in mind he also was injured going into the offseason and he said himself he wasnt able to practice and only rehabbed his injury in the offseason. He went from averaging 34 in houston to 25 in brooklyn but that was because he had an entirely different role than he did in houston, and he doesn't get any praise for that. going from best scorer in the league to best facilitator in the league.  Injury + new rule + shitty start to season + kyrie drama of course hes not gonna be playing the best basketball in his career. that 4 point dropoff probably comes from all those factors. in total hes only down 4 points, 1 rebound, and 1 assist since last season. hes also second to chris paul in assists per game and could easily win an assist title this year. luckily its a long season and it should get him in shape/where he needs to be hopefully. I completely agree with the knicks fan that you shouldn't be booing your teams stars over a bad game. especially when theres no end in sight to the relationship of that player + team, its literally only 20 games in and if we get better its going to be through him improving, im not saying to cheer him on when he plays like this but dont leave him out to dry... i was there at the game too, and nets fans in general are pretty trash, they rarely cheer, barely anyone chants defense, no one makes noise when asked to make some noise its pretty sad and feels kinda cringe in the moment honestly. completely different vibe from msg/kincks who cheer for immanuel quickley like hes mj (thats how it should be)"
"&gt; I think it’s the Chris Paul perception that keeps people from praising him more.   That is absolutely a big reason why. You even have people crediting CP3 entirely for the Suns’ turnaround, when in reality they showed their potential prior to Ayton’s suspension in 19-20 and then again in the Bubble."
And chris paul was the problem?
thanx chris paul
"Back-to-back 40 point games in the finals too, almost put them over the edge in those close games, I think it's the Chris Paul perception that keeps people from praising him more."
"#I got two words for ya. DEVIN BOOKER AND CHRIS PAUL, MUST SEE TV"
This is why Chris Paul is better than Harden all time. Hope this helps
"I don’t think KJ controlled the game like Chris Paul did. KJ was elite at getting to the rim and creating opportunities for others with penetration (insert pedo joke). CP orchestrates the entire offense, can dictate the pace of a game and oozes leadership. Disclaimer: I was a KJ stan for sure when he was playing. Not so much as an adult knowing some of the things he did."
Chris Paul?
But he didn't even rebound tonight. That's the worst part. All 6ft of Chris Paul ended the game with more boards than DA
Chris Paul is nowhere near that high in the MVP race
"Jesus, where to start? General early season apathy. The complete mistreatment and utter disrespect of Ayton. Chris Paul is washed up. He over performed last year b/c he was playing for that final bag. Now he has nothing left to prove. Also Mikal Bridges turned into an actual bridge. No disrespect, but I'd be surprised if they manage to get the 8 seed. /s"
"Chris Paul is 5th or 6th in the MVP race, so him."
"Yep, Chris Paul is definitely the most talked about player we've had since Shaq. I think some fans just want to differentiate that our success (and Booker's) is not all because of CP3 but rather a variety of things."
"But you are comparing a alltime great with a undimensional offensive player, it's unfair to Melo, there's a HUGE difference in talent. I think good defenders are the players who can predict two, three steps ahead, similar to PGs like Chris Paul and Kidd on offense. And to predict plays, there's a lot of other intangibles involved, it's a whole different game on both sides. That's why perfect players like Duncan, Olajuwon, Jordan, etc.. they are so rare, because to play both sides of the court at the same high level is extremely hard. Nash could predict everything on offense, but he was a cone on defense. You just can't predict plays by being a high energy guy, in fact the opposing player can use that energy against you, the defender over commits and gets blow by (it happened with Nash time and time again). I disagree that hustle is such a big deal on defense, in fact I think hustle is the bare minimum, it's not about praising a high energy player, he is doing his job. It's like asking FT shooters to improve their shooting to above 70%, it's the least expected. Melo's ego is too great, that's why he never cared. And as a dubious bonus, he rebounds the ball decently, maybe in his mind he is doing enough by crashing the boards, so he doesn't need to play defense... and here we are, always crushed in the first round, got kicked out of the league and then returned to play on a team focused on offense (that, guess what, got murdered in the playoffs yet again) and now by some miracle he is shooting well thus far, but that is going to stop sooner or later. When Melo is not shooting well, he becomes a complete dead weight and the fact Vogel is playing him for almost 30 minutes is a huge liability for the Lakers"
"I mean if chris paul and james harden can make it, i dont think flopping will be the determining issue"
Remember when the Rockets gave up a net of one first rounder to turn Chris Paul into John Wall?
"Harden looking like Chris Paul did when he had his hamstring injuries was completely unexpected and kinda ironic. Would have been more ironic if the Suns actually won the chip last year though  I think Harden will be fine, but Im not so sure it will be this year. Mans better call CP3 about that vegan diet"
Chris Paul is this even a question.
"Only Chris Paul was in the 2018 season, and you saw what happened. 65 wins, 70 win pace at full health and had your team shitting it’s pants down 3-2 until they got bailed out"
"It's also a weird situation because around 20010 when he came into the league it was a turning point for Point Guards and what teams were looking for in Point Guards.  He came in as a player with hype because most teams didn't neccesarily looked for a Point Guard who could score 20+ a game on super high efficiency. Guys like Steve Nash, Deron Williams, Chris Paul were an exception because they could do both (and even then CP3 and D-Will only had 2 20+ seasons)  The prototype for many teams were Rajon Rondo and Chris Paul, a guy that would get shitload of assists, and on defense preferably lock down the opposing Shooting Guard.  Then Steph Curry blew up, D-Rose became an MVP, Wall/Kyrie/Westbrook showed up in the league, and suddenly the ideal Point Guard became a scoring machine (again) who could get assists where needed.   Ricky never really stood a chance, and even with his injuries slowing him down he's always been a good Dime&amp;D player he was at the start. Except the shot never developed, and with the change in team priorities his fate was sealed."
"in my opinion he could four peat and he still wouldnt be considered the goat. that would make him 7-6 in the finals. of any great in the discussion for goat, none of them has as bad finals records as LeBron. Now talking about the titles he has won, he had the best team in the League with zero competition with Kobe hurt and retiring, and the second biggest competitor being a young KD in 2012. Bosh and Allen bailed him out vs the Spurs the next year, Kyrie was the only player to score a basket from the field in the last 3 minutes of the Warriors Cavs series, and now 2020 2 of the top 5 players of in the league have had devastating 2-3 year injuries and the Lakers are somehow able to afford AD and Bron in a year where no one else can compete. but recall 2011 when the league vetoed a trade for Chris Paul to the Lakers, god forbid Kobe gets one top 10 player in the league but LeBron gets two or three and it all their fault when he loses, but when he wins its because of how ""amazing"" he is. no offense to Jordan and his greatness, but LeBron is getting the exact same treatment Jordan got because of the publicity he brings in. In 96 Jordans player contract was worth more than 20 entire teams salaries in the NBA, not to mention they were paying substantial numbers for other key role players in Rodman, Pippen, Kerr, etc. You see every year LeBron comes into the league with this Fantasy Team pretty much and it feels like the game caters to him or he starts crying literately in the middle of the game and wont play. I havent cared to watch the NBA since Kobe retired, all the rules have made the game so much softer to allow guys like LeBron to be more dominant in a shooting time game, I just dont see what people see in his ""greatness"""
"I think the coaches have a great appreciation for defense and that’s great to see, however, there are many amazing defenders that don’t deserve to be all-stars. I don’t think Tony Allen ever deserved to be an all-star. Ben is a unique player. He’s somewhere in between a Tony Allen and a Chris Paul."
"If it was about statistics purely, guys like Jerami Grant and De’Aaron Fox would get in over guys like Ben Simmons and Chris Paul, so not, it isn’t just stats based."
Someone link the Chris paul gif
"In no particular order.   1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. James Harden   5. Giannis   6. Nikola Jokic   7. Luka Doncic   8. Stephen Curry   9. Damian Lillard   10. Joel Embiid   11. Paul George   12. Kyrie Irving   13. Jimmy Butler   14. Jayson Tatum   15. Trae Young  16. Anthony Davis   17. KAT   18. Rudy Gobert   19. Zach Lavine   20. Bradley Beal   21. CJ Mccollum   22. Chris Paul   23. Donovan Mitchell   24. Domantas Sabonis   Those are 24 guys that are better. I think Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton and some others are better too but that’s an opinion."
"I know for a fact that isn’t true.  If you play at an MVP level, which harden has for the past 6 years, it doesn’t matter if you want to be traded or if your a bad locker room presence or both.    There are numerous times this has happened. Gilbert Arenas, Latrell Sprewell, anthony Davis, Chris Paul, Alonzo morning... etc."
"bro imagine being a suns fan and somehow think you got fucked this game lmao! holy shit..... get real people. literally just off the top of my head.... lamelo getting tackled by 2 dudes shooting a 3 in the end of the first quarter, no call. miles bridges fouled on a putback dunk attempt no free throws, terry rozier scraped in the face no call, lamelo ball getting slapped in the face no call, egregious carry by chris paul directly in front of the ref no call, booker elbowing hayward in the face and getting rewarded, ball going out on saric and giving you the ball at the end of the game........ ok thats just off the top of my head"
He had Chris Paul for two years; and he was largely injured during that time. Gordon is not even close to being a star and was very streaky
He had Chris Paul &amp; Eric Gordon
"LeBron James, Draymond Green, Chris Paul, CJ McCollum, Ricky Rubio, Jusuf Nurkic, Jared Dudley, DeMarre Carroll, Jamal Crawford, Reggie Miller and other NBA/former NBA players disagree with you"
Rookie of the Year and it's not even close   19 year old just stared down Chris Paul and Devin Booker in their building and beat em  Really wish the Warriors would have gotten him ... Him with the Warriors big 3 would have been a ton of fun (although the Hornets are really fun too)
AND AGAIN.. CHRIS PAUL. LMAOOOO
Should traded for chris paul
"Even with Chris Paul, what did the Rockets accomplish? Even with Kawhi and PG, clippers couldn’t even make it to the Lakers. Even then, what have the clippers ever accomplished, great teams or not? Jazz were still good (without Bojan tho- as a Pacers fan wanted to see him ball). Nuggets were still good. For the past decade the West has mainly been the Warriors or the Spurs, just like the East was either the Heat or Cavs. Doesn’t matter how competitive 1-8 is if the same two fuckin teams consistently go."
"Rod Strickland averaged 18/9.5/5 and 2 steals from 94 to 99 and never made the all star team. Pretty much Chris Paul numbers. But he was competing with HOFers like Drexler, Stockton, Richmond, and Payton."
"AD had to come save Lebron and the West wasn’t as strong last year. Warriors out, Rockets had playoff Westbrook instead of Chris Paul, Clippers just choked hard."
He’s number 3 at the absolute worst behind Chris Paul.
Kyrie Irving outside NBA Instagram  Chris Paul all time. He's like easily a Top 15 player imo.
"CWood, Covington and Chris Paul"
The big ones are those three and Chris Paul. And then comes everyone else.
Am I the only who was mesmerized by that half spin move jimbo Chris Paul did on LaMelo early in the game? I need a replay of that lol
More or less. I think he definitely had a stronger case last year. Even before the selections I thought that Chris Paul should make it over him given his relatively slow start.
"My all-time team looks like this  Chris Paul, Michael Jordan, Lebron, Bird, Hakeem  I want an emphasis on playmaking so I’m putting Paul in there. I could go Magic because he’s the better overall player but Chris Paul isn’t gonna be taking any shots from my other legends. As great as Magic was, and he is the greatest point guard ever, he wasn’t that efficient a scorer yet took many shots. This would clearly be the greatest playmaking team ever."
"2018 Chris Paul is probably slightly worse than 2021 Kyrie or at the very least even.  Harden has never played with someone as good as him in Houston. Now, he is playing with KD."
To point out a lack of effort or awareness is absolutely fair. Size isn’t the only thing that matters on D. Look at Chris Paul.
"You just not be watching a lot of suns games. Cam payne, cam Johnson, and mikael bridges are all playing super well it’s not just Chris Paul willing the suns to be better. And if you think it’s all bs the suns went 8-0 in the bubble with all of those guys popping off."
Oh I definitely think Ty can be an All-NBA guy for sure. Only thing I pushed back on was 25 ppg. I don’t think he’ll ever be that type of scorer. His influence on a game will be major but in a Chris Paul type of way not from major scoring numbers.
"When Chris Paul severely strained his hamstring in December 2018, he took substantial time off to correct his biomechanics. I’m not saying this is anywhere near that severe but hamstrings are tricky so it is better to be safe and ease back than risk reaggravatkon during an in opportune time (e.g., seeding battles or playoffs)."
"I look at it more by position. A pg at 27 is still in his prime. A big man at 27 is probably going to lose his knees in the next 3 years. We see how Chris Paul has stayed effective despite being 33/34, but look at blake"
What's amazing about that is it selects Chris Paul for two teams.  Now lets see if he can overtake the great Shawn Marion too lol
"This year Ayton + Bridges + C. Johnson only costs about $17.7M    For reference, one A. Wiggles costs $29.5M this year   They've got SOLID role players that are young and cheap, then they can pay Book and Chris Paul big money.   THAT's the biggest reason, their Front Office. They've drafted well (or snagged other young players) for cheap before they hit Free Agency and spend the excess money on bonafide stars. I'm fucking jealous...."
"My point is if Mike Conley was the 1B to Devin Booker on the Suns, Booker would get the spot not him.  If Chris Paul was the 1B to Mitchell on the Jazz, Paul would get the spot"
"Chris Paul has been the constant presence through the first 30 games (only missing one so far), so obviously he's probably the biggest reason. Booker and Ayton are the next group that's been a big reason why.  But personally I think Mikal Bridges improving on offense has been a real x-factor for their winning. The addition of Crowder and the continuing development of Cam Johnson go with that too. When those 3 wings are locked in on both ends, the Suns are almost unbeatable."
Chris Paul easily. Are Suns fans less touchy about Booker today? Especially because he'll almost definitely take AD's spot as an injury replacement.
"Chris Paul. I can’t believe how good he is still at this point in his career.   Without him it’s just Devin Booker dropping 40 in L’s again.   Not saying he’s carrying the team, they have a lot of talent. But none of it translates to actually winning games without CP."
2 words.  CHRIS PAUL.  Dudes just elite and makes others better.
Oh for sure. I wasn’t trying to make a claim for Smith as the all-time Clipper. Was mostly just trying to fill folks in on who he was. I do think he’s underrated but I do not believe he had the impact on the franchise and sustained individual stardom of Chris Paul or even Blake Griffin.
"3 factors: Chris Paul being a leader, DBook no longer having to worry about being doubled every play now, Deandre Ayton not being suspended for the beginning of the season like last year"
Chris Paul just elevates a team’s play man. He’s really damned good.
"Ok so, Clippers acceptable answers are:  Chris Paul  Danny Manning   Blake griffin   Young and Full of potential Lamar Odom    Here’s the thing, we"
Devin Booker is not better than Chris Paul...
"As they relocated to New Orleans, the team kept the Hornets name and logo. They played 10 seasons as New Orleans Hornets, before rebranding as Pelicans in 2013. That's complicated, that's why Chris Paul is my Hornets GOAT ;-)  Regarding the Charlotte GOAT, I don't know. These Rice/Divac/Mason teams were really good and have the best seasons of the franchise so far. Glen Rice had impressive numbers in that (short) stretch, is he the real Charlotte GOAT?  I think Zo Mourning is the best player they had, but he didn't last long either. Three seasons until he was traded since the Hornets didn't want to pay him a large contract."
"Chris Paul was traded in 3 of them, 2 if you insist he chose to be in Houston. Which means majority of his career, he was on 2 teams and his recent 3 were because he was traded to them, one season after the other. Not a result of trendy free agency"
"I think the line of thinking is something like: Booker was putting up numbers on a losing team. Now he's putting up the same numbers on a winning team, but that has more to do with adding Chris Paul."
"So I don't agree with the line of thinking I'm going to lay out here, but I think a lot of the coaches leaving him off thought about it this way:  2019, 2020: ""He's putting up numbers on a losing team""  2021: ""They're winning now, but that's more due to adding Chris Paul than anything Booker is doing."""
"C: Nikola Jokic / Joel Embiid  PF: LeBron James / Giannis   SF: Kawhi Leonard / Kevin Durant  SG: Luka Dončić  / Bradley Beal  PG: Steph Curry / Trae Young  6: Damian Lillard / Nikola Vucevic  7: DeMar DeRozan / Jaylen Brown  8: Christian Wood / Kyle Lowry  9: SGA / Zach LaVine  10: Chris Paul / Sexton  11: Donovan Mitchell / Jerami Grant   12: De'Aaron Fox / Sabonis  13: Zion Williamson / Randle  14: Ja Morant / Jimmy Butler  15: KAT / Hayward  &amp;#x200B;  All things considered it's not a horrible idea, each team has an All Star caliber player on it's roster, but the problem is injuries and all star players underperforming . Like in Miami's case, Butler is their clear cut all star but he's missed games, does Tyler Herro become their representative? Same thing with Minnesota who KAT is their best player, but Anthony Edwards has played more. Then you start having All Star nods becoming meaningless as guys like Herro would have All Star nods over James Harden."

"Damn are all Raptors fans this dumb? Paul had many options the Clippers were one of them, the Suns were also one of them. Chris Paul is very well respected by the coaches and had a say in where he wanted to end up playing, so Paul chose to play on the Suns, if he wanted to be on the Heat or anywhere else if the team wanted Paul he'd be there. OKC did not just trade him without notifying him like he's some bum"
"Really cause Chris Paul just came out and said ""I came to Phoenix because of booker and me and my team follow Books lead"" your argument sucks."
https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2917529-chris-paul-trade-rumors-thunder-give-star-permission-to-discuss-trade-to-suns.amp.html  https://www.google.com/amp/s/nba.nbcsports.com/2020/11/11/report-thunder-give-permission-to-chris-paul-to-work-out-phoenix-trade/amp/  Here's two others also
okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2020/11/11/report-suns-hard-pressed-to-give-up-10th-pick-in-a-chris-paul-deal/amp/  First paragraph. He met with Phoenix.
Chris Paul is more impactful player. Basketball isn't only scoring
"If Conley and CP3 switched places, people would be calling him an allstar for leading the Jazz to the 1 seed.  Some who puts up 16.6/8 on a 4 seed doesn’t get named all-star if their name isn’t Chris Paul. Hell, Conley is proof of that right now and his team is better."
"Randy Smith?? If it’s not chris Paul, then bob macadoo is definitely the clippers goat. He won the franchise’s one and only mvp"
"Not at all. Chris Paul might be bringing it all together, but there's nothing to bring together without Book."
"Moses Malone had 4- Rockets, Sixers, Bullets, Hawks. He also was an ABA all star on the UTAH stars.   Many players had 3 all stars on different teams. But only Chris Paul, Shaq, and Malone did on 4."
"Lol this is a bunch of bullshit. Harden was a bench player in OKC, irrelevant.  In houston, steph has *always* had the far better team, and even then in 2018 you guys got lucky as fuck with Chris Paul getting injured lmao. You don’t win if he plays.  And a regular season game is your argument? Really? Didnt harden beat you guys at oracle and hit the game winner without any of his teammates playing? And then didn’t he miss the next game against y’all only for Chris Paul to take a gigantic shit on your team? See how dumb that sounds?  No, harden hasn’t been on teams good enough to win. He was one season in 2018, but he got unlucky."
Chris Paul is leading the Suns
"Chris Paul is one of the greats. No doubt about that. But ""highest win shares per 48 minutes for a starting 6' and under player aged 35 or older"" is kind of a hilarious metric."
Dejounte has improved a lot this season but he's still scoring 15 PPG at 51 TS% and hesitant to shoot 3s typically. Chris Paul is obviously a much better player than him.  The main difference between Booker and DeMar besides scoring 5 less PPG is that Booker averages 1.9 more turnovers a game even though he averages 2.6 less assists than DeMar.
Chris Paul got in over Booker and Conley has had an extremely similar season to Paul
"I always hated when people said he couldn’t play off-ball. He played off-ball in OKC when he had guys who were better than him setting him up. Who was he supposed to play off of in Houston? The team wasn’t trying to push Chris Paul to be a full time ball handler, and Harden is so much better than Russ that it made much more sense to have the ball in his hands. Dude was putting up 30+ a night off of ISO’s as well. It’s unreasonable to expect him to run around screens when he had to carry the whole offense.  People need to watch his last few postseasons in Houston. He was getting doubled at half court and the team couldn’t score at all without him. He was the Rockets’ offense because he DIDN’T play off ball."
"Agreed. To add to that though, I just feel like Devin is one of those “great” scorers that doesn’t really impact the outcome of his teams. I think this year though that has changed as obviously he’s “winning” but I truly think it’s more of a Chris Paul effect rather than booker himself. Not to say booker is key. But still hard to say whether or not booker is just a scorer or the type of scorer that actually carries his team.  Zachs characteristics are different though. His demeanor in every point he scores has a true effect to the game and has more of a “I’m going to win this at all cost” mentality. I don’t know if that makes sense but thats the way I see it."
two weeks of them letting him run pick n rolls isn't more important than the fact he's supposedly the best player on a 13-17 team. personally. meanwhile guys like devin booker with Chris Paul and DeRozan are getting the ball in the clutch and winning the games for their teams. Conley is a much better two way player than Zion.
"Bookers numbers don't stand out though this year. I mean they are definitely good, but Chris Paul has definitely dampened his numbers to where he is in the category of ""could make it, could not""."
"I think this is it. Suns were not good last year, Chris Paul comes in like he did in OKC and has them in the playoff picture."
I was confused by NOLA picking Chris Paul and then I remembered 😂  I really liked the Pistons fan take. I really wish Detroit gets its shit back together
"Randy smith had to get replaced.... were not gonna say Blake was more important to turning that franchise around? They were literally the worst team in the league for years and had a toxic losing culture, then they draft Blake, wait a year for him to get healthy, sign Chris Paul, and they both turn the entire direction of the franchise around. Prime lob city Blake was a top 5-10 player in the league and he definitely should at least be an honorable mention when it comes to al time clippers"
"Chris Paul advertising Space Jam 2, and going to bail the world in last 5 minutes of the film - CONFIRMED"
"So Jarrett Allen and Joe Ingles are #1&amp;2 in the league this year at about 70% &amp; this “objectively “ means they are more efficient scorers than let’s say  Lebron who is at #82 &amp; at 59.1%.  Or Blake Griffin who is ranked #188th &amp; at 49.1%. That’s objective in deciding who’s more efficient at scoring?   So if it’s “objective” then its the same measure as FT% where Chris Paul &amp; KAT are #1&amp;2 at 97.2% &amp; 94.6% The 82nd ranked player is Luguentz Dort at 74.7% How about even the 110th ranked since I can’t even look up the 188th quickly enough, Marvin Bagley at 54.5%. That’s the same equivalent?   Somehow we change a measure of efficiency by just adding up nonsense &amp; averaging out and giving it a lie for a name.  It’s not “true shooting” it’s FALSE shooting.   GTFO!! with what ever idiot taught people this trash.  People who watch and follow the game forever &amp; know what it’s about would never even look at TS% as a real stat.   It’s another nonsensical advanced statistic that doesn’t measure anything just some stupid number we can add to try to act like baseball advanced statistics."
Chris “cash in the clutch” Paul
"So basically Booker is not an All Star not because of his personal play, not because of his stats, not because of his team's record, but because of his past teams' records. ""He is playing great in a great team, but he used to play great on a very bad team, so he doesn't deserve it this year"" is basically what everyone says when they argue that because of Chris Paul helping the team getting to the next level he doesn't deserve it"
Chris Paul is a Phoenix Sun
Yes I can tell you that a 9 time all nba defensive team player and one of the greatest scoring/passing point guards is the best player on the team. Get off Bookers cock and learn a thing or 2 about the game of basketball. Chris Paul is literally blowing Devin Booker out of the water in every advanced stat lmao.
Chris Paul -&gt; thicc  Kyle Lowry -&gt; thicc  Kemba -&gt; not thicc  I think that's the most simplified answer.
"To be fair, empty stats players on losing teams are more likely to be drafted first round in fantasy than someone like Chris Paul"
chris paul. he'd try the hardest.
Chris Paul is way better than DeRozan lol
Booker’s team had a better season last year without Chris Paul than Zion is this year tho. Booker is playing the same and the team is better with CP3. Why does Booker have to take a hit for his team improving?   Also Brandon Ingram is doing also as well as Zion while playing more games. It’s not like Zion is unanimously the best player just like Booker and cp3. The difference is the suns have a much better record.
Chris Paul is a superstar
"Chris ""never say never"" Paul. Guy just needs a ring. He's done pretty much everything else in the league."
A league that has 45 year old Chris Paul make an all star game isn’t stacked.
"Yeah I can’t say that I saw a lot of that honestly, I would say that the majority of well know NBA writers had the Suns in the playoffs in their predictions.   Adding Deandre Ayton and Chris Paul to a team that was already close to the playoffs was a pretty easy prediction."
If it’s one thing I’ve learned it’s to never doubt chris Paul and what he brings to a team
Chris Paul is from NC so it’s either Cheerwine or a Cookout milkshake
"Maxi Kleber  dude's a solid piano player so you know he'd crush at Guitar Hero.  Honestly think that might be the toughest game for a lot of these guys, who have giant hands and maybe not the best individual finger dexterity.  Maybe Chris Paul if his bowling skills hold up on ski-ball."
Harden coulda been better than Michael Jordan if Chris Paul never got injured
Chris Paul investigated for steroid use.
"Chris Paul was a great defender in college. Dude is a dog with quick hands, feet, and incredible instincts. He's also a basketball genius and can call out the other teams plays. Trae hasn't show any of that potential."
"Funny because I remember not too long ago tons of suns fans saying things like ""his defense isn't *that* bad"" or ""guard defense isn't that important anyway""  Chris Paul is as short as anyone, but he's an amazing defender. Defense can be learned just as much as offense can"
"It's not a double standard. Both winning and individual stats are taken into account to make a judgment.  The judgment made that this year Zion's individual performance is good enough to make it in even though he's the best player on a team with a poor record. The judgment made in previous years is that Booker's individual performance wasn't good enough to make up for him being the best player on a losing team.  Now Booker is on a winning team, but he's no longer the best player or the main driver of them winning (Chris Paul is, who made the all-star game).  You can disagree with the judgment by all means, but it's not a double standard. Individual performance and team performance both count and get combined. You can make up for a bad score in one if you're good enough in the other, but it's hard to do so.  Like, if you gave a player an 8/10 for individual performance and a 4/10 for team wins then they'd average 6/10, and you'd tell them it was the lack of winning that pulled them down and if that was higher they'd have made it.  Then the next season they give you 6/10 for individual performance and a 6/10 for team wins, they're still averaging a 6, so keeping them out isn't a double standard even though they improved what you told them to improve.  (I'm not listing those as actual ratings of Booker, just numbers picked out to illustrate a point about combined ratings)."
"Then going by your cherry picked stat, Nikola Vucevic (-11.8), Zach Lavine  (-6.7), Chris Paul (-.5), and Donovan Mitchell (-7.8), are all garbage and should not be included either since they make their teams worse. And this means that Michael Carter-Williams is the MVP of the league this year with an incredible +22.3. He improves his team more than anyone!  Sabonis is one of 3 players averaging 20/10/5  on 50% FG%. The others are Jokic and Giannis. He is the only player to ever average 20/10/5 and not make the All Star game. He is carrying the Pacers while they are down TJ Warren and Caris Levert. Saying he isn't very good is just not correct. And remains the dumbest fucking thing I've ever read."
"Zion beats him in basically every statistic there is. And if you want to throw out the “well Bookers team is winning” narrative... sure, and the main reason the Suns are winning got rewarded for that. His name is Chris Paul."
Not saying Book didn't deserve it but I'd imagine that had to do in large part to folks only wanting to choose one Suns player and then picking Chris Paul over him.
We can skip the chris paul hitting people in the nuts joke and you can just upvote this instead
Chris Paul George Carl Landry Fields
Their efficiency is basically the same 60.7 vs 60.3 TS%. Booker is also averaging 1.5 more turnovers per game even though he averages 2.6 less assists per game. And Booker's best teammate has been Chris Paul while DeRozan's best teammate has been Dejounte Murray.
"Bench mob aside, the Chris Paul effect is real.  People always complain about his contract, but he clearly makes whatever team he's on miles better."
Chris paul effect!!!
"Playing the ""No MJ or Lebron"" Game:  G: Chris Paul -6'0""- Elite Playmaker, Solid Defense  G: Steph Curry -6'3""- Elite Off-Ball Movement and GOAT Shooting ability  F: Tony Allen -6'4""- Elite On-Ball Defender  F: Kevin Durant -6'10""- Can score on anyone anytime, Versatile Defender and can rebound  C: Zion Williamson -6'7""- Elite offensive rebounding, nearly unstoppable inside the paint scoring-wise"
Heck Chris Paul LeBron James Kobe when he was alive definitely had people who wanted to hit him Cousins  Shit ton of dudes people want to hit more Heck cousins or lebron would probably be the main ones  As lebron probably has the biggest hater group And cousins just isn't a good person
"Ehh he’s got that Chris Paul, Kobe fiery temper"
He must've been sore or something. I totally forgot about him too.  They showed Chris Paul waiving off the TNT people as he went off the court. He wasn't having that shit.
Oh yeah I forgot how unclutch Chris Paul and Devin Booker are
Man Chris Paul is so intelligent and patient. Old man hoops style smarts since he was like 22.
Chris paul stop giving it to Saric lmao
Chris Paul is one of few players in league history that can dominate the offensive side of the court with less than 5 shot attempts
“Because that would have made the Lakers too powerful..”   100% incorrect.   NBA owned New Orleans at the time and needed to retain Chris Paul so they could get a higher price when they sold the team.
9 players on the court are playing with preseason energy and then there’s Dennis schroder picking up Chris Paul 90 feet from the basket every play
Chris Paul was seriously arguing that call when Saric whacks Caruso across the face. Incredible
the only thing we need to cap off this night is Chris Paul coming through the secret tunnel after the game
Nah having a passer would just introduce variance. Even Chris Paul can't make the same pass exactly the same way hundreds of times in a row.  Plus the rack enables a set shot which is a nice medium between catch and shoot vs pullup

Chris Paul making another team just good enough for an early playoff exit.

Chris Paul knew he was shooting there too
"When Chris Paul is the one kicking it out, you know the 3 is going in"
Wait when did Chris Paul play for the Suns I thought he was still in Houston
"Chris Paul is still Chris Paul, even if his shots aren’t falling his presence on the court is a massive difference maker.  Harden distributed to them because that was his role and the entire offense revolves around it.  The refs didn’t screw them lol, they went 0/27 lmfao. I’m not sure they beat the Warriors with or without Paul.  They were one of the best teams to never make the Finals, if not the best. But I think you’re doing a bit of revisionist history here in favor of Harden/Rockets.  At the end of the day Curry has always been Curry since he emerged as a superstar. If the Harden Rockets were as good as you say, simply because of Harden, and Paul wasn’t as important as you say, they should have been in similar contention when they had Westbrook, or in the last Warriors series (without KD)."
I don't see LeBron or Chris Paul strutting around like that.
Everyone knows Chris Paul wasn't playing like a top 5 PG of all time during that series. And the team was great but only because harden could distribute to them and get them open looks. Theres a very small list of teams in history that could compete with those warriors teams and even less that could actually beat them. And the rockets would've beat them if them if Paul didn't get injured and if the refs didn't screw them in game 7.
Chris Paul 6'1  Bradley Beal 6'3  MJ 6'6  Paul Pierce 6'7  Rodman 6'7
Chris Paul and Julius Randle must have changed since I last saw them
PG: Chris Paul 6'0  SG: Stephen Curry 6'3  SF: Michael Jordan 6'6  PF: Zion Williamson 6'7  C: LeBron James 6'8
"With the players hating on Allstar weekend, Chris Paul now has to do everything himself.  Play all the games, film all the commercials"
TIL Chris Paul is Bronny’s godfather
"It absolutely was not just 1 bad call, the refs easily took about 10-12 points away from harden and the warriors hit multiple threes on the other end, it was egregious.  https://youtu.be/aYveyAb6mvU  I’m not sure if you watched the rockets regularly or not but isolation and abusing mismatches was how we played. That was our team and That's how we got to where we were. And against golden state, you can’t just run those plays and cuts because they’re extremely good defense and would blow that up.  It’s also hilarious how you’re saying “they should have just got to the free throw line” as if they weren’t literally undeniably being fouled with no calls the entire time.  Regardless, Chris Paul playing stops that from happening and lessens the burden off harden by a *ton*"
Chris Paul had to go to his happy place after that bridges pass
Harrell just tried to post a 6 ft Chris Paul and got clamped.  GOAT PG pfp
"Chris Paul, Allen Iverson, Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Ben Wallace"
"Us didn’t imply you were included. He took us to the WCF twice and ran into the best team ever. He should have won the 2018 ring but Chris Paul got hurt (the 2018 WCF were also basically the nba finals.  He put the team on his back for 8 years, 2 WCF, 4 Semi Finals, and the playoffs every single season with minimal help right smack in the middle of the most unfair team ever is more then impressive. He won an MVP (deserved multiple more) with us and was all nba first team in almost every season aside from 1. I can go on all day but to imply it makes zero sense to retire the number of the greatest guy to wear our jersey since hakeem is absurd"
Rocket legend Chris Paul
2016 - Russell Westbrook (blew 3-1 lead)  2015 - Westbrook (lost in the first round in 2019)  2014 Kyrie (Thinks the world is flat)  2013 - Chris Paul (Got injured in 2011)
"You can thank chris paul for that. Once he went down, so did the team. Never forget the 0-27 from harden. Never got past the second round. I would not retire his number."
Chris Paul gonna win the skills challange
Chris Paul is doing this cause he has to as president
damn i would not want to be going up against chris paul lol
"I also included his shooting splits, but obviously the team record is the same for both. I'm not sure what you were expecting me to provide. If Chris Paul is leading *any* team in scoring for a season, month, week, whatever, than something has gone very wrong or someone is injured."
"&gt;  Just because players want to live in California or not pay income tax in texas?  Sorry thought this went without saying but yes. We're just now getting into the era where players can live where they want because of free agency so now players around that 2000 or so mark you saw the effects of players beginning to self sort themselves by what they wanted, not what teams wanted.   &gt;The clippers were a joke until 10 years ago, as were the Mavs before the Nowitzki era.   Right and thats exactly it. The clippers were only able to become no longer a joke because they filled a demand in the free agency market ie they're in LA. If they aren't in LA they don't get Chris Paul, Kawhi, or even Baron Davis. Same with Dallas but to a less extent. They aren't able to pay vets important to their teams lower salaries if taxes weren't so low there.   With Golden State (ie Oakland) and Sac, you get all the taxes without the perks of living in a big market. You have to remember Oakland has changed A LOT in the past 10 or so years.   &gt;The Utah/Denver point is a good one! Do they, over time, have better home/away splits than most other teams?  I mean I'm sure they're out there but Denver and Utah teams are notorious for over performing in the regular season due to having a conditioning advantage at home, while under performing in the playoffs because its a disadvantage on the road."
"If he wins Rookie of the Month every month for the rest of the year, it's basically assured he'll make an All-NBA team sooner rather than later.    The only players to have won every single rookie of the months are:  * Luka * KAT * Dame * Blake Griffin * Chris Paul * Lebron * Carmelo * Tim Duncan * David Robinson  Okay i know correlation does not imply causation.  It's more like a fun fact."
"&gt;Even considering throwing in Adams's contract, you're looking at a real small amount of ""players that make a ton of money and are tradeable."" Chris Paul? Ben Simmons? Kemba Walker?  you dont need to salary match if the team has has the cap space to absorb it."
He kind of reminds of a flashier rookie Chris Paul even though he’s not as good
"&gt;	 Although it’s pretty obvious curry hasn’t had an MVP season since Durant came  According to what? Curry is the engine that drives the historic offenses when you remove him they become a 45-50 win team *with Durant and Klay and Draymond all playing*. Guess what happens when Durant misses significant time, or Klay? Curry still cooking around a 70 win pace.   The funny thing is, we have the years of data to back this. It’s not a weird conspiracy. We have 3 years of regular and post season data proving what I am harping right now. Curry—and Draymond to a good extent—are the backbone of the best offenses the league has ever seen. Offenses so high octane that you can let Durant and Klay miss significant time and Curry will keep the engine  running on full cylinders.   If this doesn’t qualify as MVP status I do not know what does. It’s the same with Lebron. Or Chris Paul. Their impact is only captured by impact stats but this sub hates those because they associate it with harden flopping on the perimeter to get a call."
"He should thank, dwight howard, chris paul , russell westbrook, trevor ariza, eric gordon , clint capela , pj tucker  and the refs/ adam silver when the rockets retire his jersey"
"The roster may not look sexy because a lot of the guys who are washed now like PJ Ariza EG Mbah a Moute Anderson and Gerald were very good role players that fit Morey's system like a charm, we were very deep all around. And then obviously Harden and Chris Paul are Harden and Chris Paul. 2 all time top-five players in their position imo."
It would be pretty cool for Chris Paul to come back to retire where he started
Who beats them in 2017? They went 12-0 in the West that year remember. 2018 if the rockets still make the move for Chris Paul is a genuine toss up though
Chris paul is the only reason we are good
I mean they would of won in '17 (or 18 idk) if Chris Paul doesn't get hurt.
Andre Drummond and Chris Paul
"His deal and the extension makes very unhappy but has wide support from the fanbase, at least the pels sub.  I still think there was a different road where instead of selling jrue we bought chris paul and we would have been scary and easily picked up a good center for less money. I also dont like the actual jrue trade.   As for bledsoe vs hill, i just dont see okc agreeing to bledsoe.  Griff has admitted he has a preoccuptation with Adams. I like the guy but he just isnt a good fit and his skill set does not merit his contract.   I thought when we signed svg, we were gonna do a Orlando dwight howard thing with zon surrounded by shooters. A floor spacing big would have been perfect for that. Another aspect is that hayes and adams have overlapping skillsets so we have a lotto pick and 17 million per year tied up in roles that dont complement our best player.  Im pretty iffy on griff but only time will tell."
What about Chris Paul and Cliff Paul?
Love seeing him get his empty stats AND wins thanks to Chris Paul!!!
"Who are they gonna get that's better, though?   Even considering throwing in Adams's contract, you're looking at a real small amount of ""players that make a ton of money and are tradeable."" Chris Paul? Ben Simmons? Kemba Walker?   Seems like they're gonna have to back the Brinks truck up, or punt completely on this season by trading for bad contracts and picks, which feels antithetical to where they are in their development."
Yeah but that Chris Paul had your warriors shitting there pants until he got injured so I’d say it worked
Most people wouldn't even have known who Chris Paul was in 2004
"Were they? Nobody said they wouldn’t work. If you check the top comments, the concern was with paying an aging Chris Paul 40M per year.   Clearly this fear was justified because you gave up picks to trade CP3 after just two years."
"He gets relentlessly doubled in the playoffs by good teams every game. The only time this strategy didn't work was when he had Chris Paul, and if he didn't get hurt then Houston would've won a title. You can't play the same defense against Steph because of his HOF teammates. For some reason this is held over Harden's head."
"Signing an aging Chris Paul who you traded after 2 seasons is a bit different than Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving teaming up."
Yes they did. They said the same when Chris Paul joined Houston also. The narrative never changes.
Lebron has won zero games against the KD Warriors (in the playoffs) without Kyrie Irving.  Harden has won zero games against the Kd Warriors (in the playoffs) without Chris Paul.
"My whole issue with Rockets fans is how delusional they are in regards to the outcome of that 2018 WCF series. They act as if the injury to Chris Paul hadn't occurred, they would have definitely advanced, while never taking into consideration the injury to Andre Iguodala, or the margin of victory in the previous games in the series, etc."
Someone should ask Devin Booker what his thoughts are on how Chris Paul has made the team so much better than last year.
"Yeah I was really debating on who should start, chris paul or cam payne, tonight showed me"
"Chris Paul is special, man. What a fucking player. His influence on the court can not be understated."
I was reading something the other day but dude was average at UNC and came off the bench. He’s the perfect example of a player drafted on their potential or what they could become at their peak.  The Hawks missed a perfect opportunity to fix their PG situation. Deron would’ve been a good choice or *maybe* Chris Paul.
"Like a good point guard, Chris Paul is there"
Watching Chris Paul carry a team to a win at 35 while only scoring 14 is something else.   Appreciate his greatness while you still can.
I'm assuming Chris Paul played well?
Chris Paul is an all star
Chris Paul 😏
"There's no doubt that Chris Paul is the best player on this team. Game after game, he always has the highest impact (BPM)."
Chris Paul should've been Mighty Mouse
Thats not a nickname though. No one would address him as that. People call Chris Paul CP3.
This season who’s better Ben Simmons or Chris Paul
"Kobe was much better than Wade come on. Even Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, Carmelo Anthony, James Harden"
"Lol harden didnt make the finals because there was always a superteam in the way. Things complete out of his control stopped that. If Chris Paul plays the rockets are champs, and harden is no better or worse as a player. He just didn’t get unlucky. Which is why these arguments are stupid. Hardens best season &gt; KDs"
"Lol the 27 missed threes included made threes from harden that the refs waved off and multiple fouls. You guys got fucking bailed out. And then the next year the refs give you game 1 for free off tons of no calls.  MJ played in 95 genius, and you’re delusional if you think the 50 win cavs were doing shit to the 65 win rockets  Also, have you guys won anything that wasn’t because you got lucky with injuries? 2015 kyrie and love, 17 got your ass kicked then kawhi goes down, 18 down 3-2 Chris Paul. All luck"
I am saying Chris Paul impact is just much more visible compare to demar. He helped the suns to win all those clutch game. That why Chris Paul is selected over him. Again not saying demar have no impact on Spurs winning.
Significantly worse than Chris Paul? They're pretty comparable. I'll be honest I haven't watched Chris a lot this season but if you're just looking at stats I wouldn't say he's significantly better than Demar.
I’d rather have prime Chris Paul George Hill tbh
"Well I had DeRozan &gt; Chris Paul. I thought the Suns, while good, didn’t need two All-Stars. Paul is 16/4/8 on good efficiency, which is a tad worse than DeRozan’s imo. He’s a legend though and plays better defense so I’m sure that swung things with coaches. I just personally would’ve picked Booker originally and then DeRozan &gt; Paul. Once Paul and Zion got in originally though, I knew it was going to be Booker for the AD replacement, and it’s hard to argue against that.  Still though, DeRozan deserved an All-Star spot. You haven’t watched enough Spurs games if you disagree."
The Sceret Stuff by Chris Paul is great marketing (if intended that way).
Chris Paul George Muresan.  7’7  Super athletic  Great defender  Phenomenal passing  Super ballhandling
Chris Paul George would be the goat
"Marvin Williams is the epitome of a perfectly average and adequate player.  Never a great scorer, about 1:1 assist to turnover, but he wasn't terrible at anything and could play okay defense.  Tell a retired NBA player who was around in the 70s and 80s that Marvin Williams earned over $120 million in his career and they'd probably have an aneurysm.      I feel like his career turned out okay and wasn't really overshadowed by being picked over Chris Paul.  Not the kind of thing that really dragged him down the way it has/will with Marvin Bagley."
Lol bullshit. Warriors literally got a free ring in 2018 because the refs let them maul harden (and chris Paul didn’t play) and won game 1 2019 WCSF because Klay undercut harden 4 times in a half

Jokic and Horford are both 10 for 18, AD is 12 for 26, and Reggie Jackson is a scorching 2 for 28."
"What does that have to do with anything? Charles Barkley never won a championship, Chris Paul never went to a finals. Situations and many factors play into playoff success. We are mearly talking talent. McGrady is more individual talented. ""In my opinion."""
"I didn’t make a claim, I disputed one. And yes I agree that people making claims should support those claims with some sort of reasonable objective evidence, but you can’t argue with someone’s subjective definition of an undefinable term. I would contend that Chris Paul a massively important player and the president of the players union is far more recognizable to the common fan than most players, let’s just leave it at that."
"It really feels like you've just copy-pasted a description of chris paul as your criteria for a superstar and it feels rather arbitrary. Why don't you define your terms? So, it isn't their current status as a player that decides it alone, but they do, currently, need to be good enough to barely cut the all-star team, and they had to have been a top player in their position for five years in the past, but they need, now, to be receiving a giant contract? Okay, fine -  Was LaMarcus a superstar in 2019?"
Chris Paul is an all star this year and makes 40 million this year how are those even comparable
Chris Paul isn’t a superstar? He was the best pg in the league for like 5 years?
"Well in that case there are only like 2-3 superstars of that size, so what's the point of the comment, also is it just me or is it weird that Chris Paul isn't considered a superstar? I get it but it feels so wrong when I say it out loud hahahah"
"what the fuck? Chris Paul man, Lowry too, they're even shorter as well. Jrue isn't as popular so doesn't count I guess but him too."
"That’s a valid point, and I do think Russ remains an excellent playmaker, which is why despite some of the awful numbers I believe he is not a negative player (at least in the regular season).  But remember that usage rate takes into consideration only field goal attempts, free throw attempts, and turnovers. So his high usage means the assists are weighed down somewhat. How much? I was curious so I tried to calculate how many offensive possessions in total Westbrook used.  The Wizards pace was 104.1, and Westbrook played 2369 minutes. So he was on the floor for approximately 5138 offensive possessions (could be some error here since their pace may have been different with him on the floor, but that would just mean even more possessions for him). He used 30.2% of those possessions, so he used in total about 1552 possessions. Meanwhile he tallied 763 assists.  For reference, the same analysis for Chris Paul says he used about 1006 possessions and tallied 622 assists. So WB used about 50% more possessions (with a much lower TS% and a much higher turnover rate) and didn’t tally nearly 50% more assists.  This doesn’t factor in hockey assists, passes into fouls, etc. But it does illustrate how Westbrook’s ball-dominance doesn’t necessarily translate to that many more assists to compensate for his inefficient scoring and high turnover rate."
My one friend who's smarter than me(used to coach D2) and a huge LeBron fan told me a couple months ago even he thinks what CP3 is doing at his age is probably more impressive than what LeBron is. Obviously CP3 is no LeBron but a 5'11 guard with his injury track record doing what he is at age 36 I just never saw it Im still shocked by it. 24/9 on 62% TS this postseason after the first round when he could use both his shoulders again at age 36 therell of course be players who enter the NBA who are better than CP3 was but youre going to go a long long time without ever seeing another Chris Paul. One of the biggest outliers in NBA history.
"I was never a huge Chris Paul doubter and even defended him a bit. But I never expected his level of play to stay this good into his mid 30s. I thought his last year of his contract was going to look bad for it's cost, but him actually turning down his player option I never saw coming.  I mean outside of Lebron who has been this good at 36? Kobe even retired at 37 and at 36 was basically doing a fair well tour, Michael Jordan was retired at 36 (came back for those 2 wizard years), more examples I could give. Chris Paul was an injury prone guard but finally stayed healthy through the playoffs at 36? It's remarkable."
"This is a correct take.   I actually do prefer Devonte Graham on his contract certainly over Dinwiddie and what he got, probably over what Schroeder and Reggie Jackson are going to get, and arguably over Lonzo (though really I think Lonzo comes down to more that Lonzo simply does not want to be in NO).  But there's no doubt that the point of everything Griffin did was for Chris Paul and Kyle Lowery, he struck out on both, and punting with cap space/moveable to next year, while not making the situation worse, is obviously not what he paid all of those 1st round picks for."
"That and the Suns guy going ""Chris Paul for one... two..."" and then stopping. Horrendous"
He saw how much old mans like Chris Paul and Lowry got and wanted to cash in.
I believe in Smart but you make a good point. He'll never probably be a Chris Paul caliber distributer since his handles and shots aren't great.  BUT I'd love him as a 7th man who can finish games.  Btw fuuuuuck our team will suck this year. Trust the Bradcess I guess.
"Because Harden and group of scrubs can be a playoff team and that team was full of great defenders and good shooters, so they were already very good. Without Chris Paul, we would probably still make the WCSF imo, maybe even the WCF to get swept by GSW."
"Lmao do you hear yourself? Game 6 wasn't a pivotal game? It was literally their win or go home game and was close all the way. And yes Chris Paul was suppose to perform better and did, it wasn't even close tbh. 22/8 on 62% TS. Game 6 wasn't a pivotal game lmfao I'm done you got it keep following narratives"
"Game 3 and game 6 weren’t pivotal games in the series for the suns, and it’s not like Chris Paul was that good in game 3. Games 4 and 5 is really where the bucks took control of the series. Paul is supposed to perform better than book, he was the mvp candidate he is the first ballot hall of gamer leader of the team. He didn’t show up when they needed him too. You could say that about book game 3 and 6 sure but he isn’t an mvp candidate or the leader of the team. Considering the context Booker actually stepped up in the biggest games (4 and 5) and Chris Paul didn’t, Chris Paul was definitely more of a disappointment considering expectations."
"Suns led game 4 90% of the game, and Chris Paul had more turnovers than made field goals. The disappointment is CP3."
"No one saying he was 2015 lebron. Im just saying book actually showed up and played pretty well given the circumstances, he wasn't a dissapointment like you say. Was he incredibly efficient no, but he certainly did his job and got buckets. Phoenix could have won game 4 Devin booker was keeping them in that game all alone, Chris Paul was no where to be found. Game 5 Book balls out again, again chris paul no where to be found until he hits some 3s in the fourth quarter that make his efficiency box score look good but he was no where to be found the first 3 quarters. That was the turning point in the series."
"What type of excuse is this.It's his job to carry the offensive load. And let's not act like he was 2015 LeBron out there. Chris Paul 22/8, Ayton 14, Bridges 12 crowder 12"
"CP3 has bad knees. When he struggled his last season in Houston, people were saying he was done. Chris Paul had his meniscus removed in 2010. He has always had bad knees."
Chris Paul lost game 4 on his own that could have put them up 3-1 and changed the outlook of that series. Maybe he takes Best Player and Disappointment
What? I literally looked this up. Multiple sites all say 2012 (https://www.sportscasting.com/chris-paul-state-farm-commercial-predicted-hed-lose-bucks-nba-finals/). If I am wrong please point link me.
"Chris Paul flops, but he isn’t rlly dirty. And yes, it’s annoying when Paul flops, but again, the Clippers took it to the extreme. And, the Suns complained about calls in that series, but there were some very questionable calls, and they don’t have a reputation for always complaining about calls."
"Also, can I get a source on that $8 million a year? I have one that says 8 million for ALL his endorsements including Nike, Air Jordan and Tissot. Those might contribute to the 8 million substantially.  https://fansided.com/2021/07/20/chris-paul-state-farm-endorsement-value/"
Lol Chris Paul is one of the dirtiest players. Wtf are you talking about? Did watch the Suns in the playoffs? They were flopping and complaining all the time
Chris Paul and Damion Lee got vaccinated and still got Covid
Chris Paul and Damion Lee got vaccinated and still got Covid
"Chris Paul too. They've definitely built a reputation of being kind to players which is probably invaluable as a small market. Compare that to Boston where AD's father said he wouldn't play there because of how they treated IT. Part of LeBron's decision to go to LA (beyond the obvious business/Hollywood opportunities) was that the Lakers took care of Kobe and have more of a family culture.  Players will generally always put money, championship potential, and location as their top priorities in choosing teams, but having that extra ""we will treat you right while you're here and if you want to leave later on we will do everything to help you"" can be a tipping point for players when debating similar situations."
"&gt; Tom Brady, CP3, Lebron, Biden  Chris Paul the only one on that list without a chip."
"He might not be in a Raptors jersey anymore, but the disrespect of putting Kyle Lowry in the same tier as Fox and Morant is simply silly.  We're talking about a guy who headlined this year's FA along with Chris Paul as THE targets for Championship teams."
Chris Paul number 5 in mvp voting has to be higher than that
How is Chris Paul not in tier 2
"Why would you measure salary per hour? If Chris Paul makes 35mil a year playing 70 games a year, and Patrick Mahomes makes 35mil a year but only plays 16 games a year, then who is actually more ""well paid""?"
Chris Paul one's were hilarious also.
Overall narrative about Chris Paul
Blake Griffin being an established star on the Clippers before the Chris Paul trade. Paul was traded right after Griffin's rookie season. So he basically always played with CP3. I thought he had a few years as an all star and CP3 put them over the hump from middle of the pack team to championship contenders.
&gt;  OKC fans thought for sure they could flip him for a 1st which was laughable.  Legend has it the same comment was made in 2019(?) when OKC traded for Chris Paul
Fuck no they wouldn't lmao.  Fox is literally the best point guard you put need to Embiid except maybe Chris Paul/Dame
that’s NC State legend Julius Hodge and the receiver of an infamous Chris Paul nut punch
"That man said fuck a Chris Paul rehabilitation type season, LET ME OUT!!!"
Also people forget Phoenix actually came together and hit their stride in the playoff bubble and won eight straight and looked great before Chris Paul came along. He may be kind of didn't actually elevate Phoenix they were already figuring it out and pretty darn good. Also it was a crazy playoff with all kinds of injuries and if teams were healthy Phoenix never would have made it to the finals.
The league is such a copycat League.  You always see this where someone has success doing something a certain way and then everyone feels like they have to do it or really they're so stupid and lack any creative thinking that they just take whatever's easily afforded to them. And if it fails they can just say well look that's what everyone else was doing. Everyone else was paying big contracts to these crafty veterans to come in and elevate a team of young players to play off success.  Could it be that Chris Paul was just a fluke? Could it be that LeBron James and his incredible performance in his mid-30 still being arguably the best player in the game at least top three is because he's an absolute genetic freak who also does everything he possibly can to stay on top?  I really think you're going to see Conley and Lowry become unplayable quickly. DeRozan is a little younger and he's a bigger guard but of course he can't space the floor so his life expectancy is going to be pretty short.
Yep and I'm talking about forward thinking I'm not talking about what have you done for me lately or last year it's what are you going to do for me next year or in two or three years when I'm paying you 30 million or more to sit on the bench. You do know that NBA players rapidly fall off in their mid to late 30s right? The exceptions to that are incredibly rare. And the league continues to get deeper in talent younger faster more athletic players the players coming out now are incredibly talented.  So you enjoy paying a 40-year-old Chris Paul 33 million
"Wow, there is going to be an incredible amount of buyer's remorse after this off season.  When did washed up veterans go from getting exceptions and minimums to commanding salary cap crunching salaries?  Oh we need the veteran leadership?  Good luck with that veteran leadership on the floor when the player can't stay in front of anyone and is suddenly even less efficient because without their athleticism their shot gets defended a lot easier.  This is pure insanity.  LeBron is an absolute freak of nature, and Chris Paul as well as he played, each season there is a serious risk of him hitting the wall.  Nevermind Lowry, Derozan, Conley.   Those guys are about to be on the rapid decline."
"Chris Paul was much better and Kemba isn't expiring until next year, he wasn't going to decline a player option so we could flip him to the kings for a second rounder."
"He might have been as an expiring contract. Idk, people said the same thing about Chris Paul"
"I'm glad that Zach Lowe is the one saying this, now r/NBA might shut up about the player empowerment boogieman and listen. Player empowerment isn't the issue if the team has shown again and again that they can't build good teams around their star players, not with Chris Paul, not with AD, and now Zion. At this point, maybe they do need to move out of the city."
Chris ”punches people in the nuts” Paul.
"Ignoring the actual criminals;  Rondo and Wade are 1 and 2, no doubt about it. Order depends on the day. I’ll say I at least respect Wade as a basketball player. Can’t say the same for Rondo.   Behind them would be Chris Paul and Dragic (and hEaT cUlTurE in general tbh). Great players (generational in the case of CP3), great work ethic. Got no respect for dirty players. Both guys have a long history of trying to hurt players."
Don’t worry. They’ll get the next generational prospect to fuck up. We have to have the Chris Paul -&gt; Anthony Davis -&gt; Zion continuity
"TIL I was honour-bound to join the Bucks bandwagon, not just because Chris Paul is a dick."
"&gt; The number of stars that the Lakers have signed in free agency is actually quite small. Basically just O'Neal and James ... a surplus of talent that they then leverage to trade for stars  It's a little disingenuous to gloss over all of the players who have specifically forced their way off of other teams and on to the Lakers - Kareem, AD, prime Dwight, what should've been prime Chris Paul - as though the Lakers just happened to make those trades organically."
Why would it be a scummy move lol? Pelicans did the same thing with AD and Chris Paul in failing to give either of them sufficient help through terrible moves and wasted assets. If they want star players to stay there maybe they should give them a reason to.
"Height is one hell of a metric. Still blows my mind to not only see Chris Paul be in the NBA this long, but be a top paid player at 36."
"Yeah I agree it would be the death of super teams unless superstars take actual pay cuts  But man that would kill the Tobias Harris and Wiggins of the league. With so much less money available they would go from 30M a year players to like 15M max and so on   Also older players would get a lot less money like imagine paying booker and Chris Paul the same salary for the next 4 years, bookers agent would get him both of those wages  Free Agency would be a million times better too"
In one year the cap goes up $5M and we get rid of Deng’s dead money. That’s $10M gained.  In two years both LeBron and Westbrook’s contracts expire and the cap goes up again. That’s almost $80M gained in cap space.  The Lakers are trying to retain maximum talent in 1-year windows. And I think it makes a ton of sense.   After the 2022-2023 season we build a bit more long-term by trying to find AD someone his age that’s a star and Westbrook and LeBron have the option of hanging on and retiring Lakers or LeBron can go play with his kid (if we don’t manage to draft him) / Westbrook can go chase money like Chris Paul and maybe land on another contender.  But my guess is there’s someone out there who’s want to play in L.A. with AD in their 30s. Maybe it’s Zach Lavine or maybe Tatum. NBA rosters and free agency destinations are harder to predict than champions.
"No reliable Knicks source has linked them to Lonzo, I don't think they were ever really interested in him. Seems like Chris Paul was the Knicks plan A but that fell through, bringing back Rose and signing Fournier was most likely plan B"
Since he was drafted in 2018 Landry Shamet has played with the following teammates  * Joel Embiid * Ben Simmons * Jimmy Butler * Kawhi Leonard * Paul George * James Harden * Kyrie Irving * Kevin Durant * Chris Paul * Deandre Ayton * Devin Booker
Ahhh yesss because we mistreat players so terribly other than JJ when did we do anybody wrong?  What fantasy land do you live in? When did we ever leak negative stories about anyone?  Maybe we did my boy Tyson Chandler back in 2009 when we randomly tried to trade him to OKC after having his best season with Chris Paul. And I seriously doubt you had that one lined up.   So please inform me? I guess I missed some major headlines.
Your analytics should have told you Chris Paul is injury prone
Chris Paul got hurt and we ran into the Warriors Superteam terrible example
He made r/nba believe that you can’t have more than one ball handler (despite the Rockets best teams having Chris Paul) and that guys that shoot 36% from three when being left unguarded all game are the only way to have proper spacing on a basketball.
"Opponents love him because he screws up his own teams from winning. His good/bad play ratio at the end of game is bad. That’s why. He whines. Diva . Couldn’t play with Durant, Harden, Chris Paul, or Beal . I mean you add him to these 4 players and that’s a championship. 3HOF and no championship. Bruh"
"He could maybe get more. But he would be smart to go to a team with plenty of media coverage so he could make his name big again. Only reason he got big was because he was with chris Paul. He's gotta find a another guy like that to play off of and better his image. Clips actually need a pg if Reggie Jackson leaves. And with kawhi out, he's probably the second option."
"&gt;Caruso is not a willing shooter he has averaged 2.1 three point attempts in the last 3 years.  He's averaged 20 minutes per game the last three years. He took 5.5 attempts per 100 possessions, which is below average but fine, and in-line with the volume of guys like Tobias Harris, Harrison Barnes, and Chris Paul. He was also more comfortable this year taking shots even when he wasn't wide open, which is important.  &gt;Of course Curry is going to be heavily guarded from three and he’s the best shooter ever so naturally he will make more difficult shots than 37 year old Carmelo Anthony.  This is a total non-sequitur. Nobody disagrees with this.  &gt;It’s not Carmelo’s fault that he has the luxury of more open shots.  My point is that if your best shooter is just above average and can't even play more than 20 minutes per game, and if your second best shooter is LeBron (while sharing the floor with AD and Westbrook), that team is a very very bad shooting team. Not sure how anyone can disagree with this.  &gt;Why are you downplaying other peoples percentages who happen to get more open threes?  Because if you're open, you should have higher percentages. That's the entire point. 38% from three is good on its face. However, league average when you're wide open is 39-40%. If you only take wide open shots but you shoot worse than 39%, that makes you below league average.   If you have a team of 37% shooters, but they only take wide open shots, that would be a team of terrible shooters. A team of shooters that shoots 35% on a mix of attempts on higher volume is more valuable and are better shooters than the first group."
Gary Payton  Karl Malone  Chris Paul  Dwight Howard  Steve Nash  Pau Gasol  Metta World Peace
"Three Suns players should be watched carefully this upcoming season. Devin Booker is going to have hardly any time off after playing into the Finals and then right into the Olympics before getting back to work for next year (training camps start in about 7 weeks). Jae Crowder will be playing his second consecutive season on extremely short rest after making the Finals in back to back years, each with the shortest off-seasons ever. And of course Chris Paul, who has never gone deep into the playoffs at all so he's always had a long off-season, and now will be playing on extremely limited rest.   I think Phoenix could have a lot of problems this year."

We're just making up for the Chris Paul trade that was vetoed
he said no Chris paul
"Meh. I’d honestly only put the Lakers into the West elite category, and that’s if they’re fully healthy. You could pair anyone up with Lebron and AD and be elite. Clippers get in their own way to truly be considered elite. Phx has an argument, but another year of an aging Chris Paul puts them squarely into the fringe elite along Utah. Denver is close to fringe elite, probably already there when healthy.  Would also bump up Atlanta to fringe elite for the East. They’re young and only going to get better after an already elite playoff run.   The rest looks pretty good though"
"There were three players over 33 who played significant roles on this years playoff teams: Mike Conley, Chris Paul, Lebron. They all had injuries in the playoffs. Goran Dragic, Carmelo, Joe Ingles, Gallinari were probably the next most significant contributors over 32 on playoff teams. Dragic had injuries late in the season. Gallinari had a playoff injury. None played over 30 minutes a game and closer to 20-25 minutes.   The list of guys 33+ who play 30+ minutes deep into the playoffs is a very short list. Lebron, Chris Paul, and Kyle Lowry 2 years ago at 33 are it really in the last few years.   The Lakers are going to have to be really smart to distribute the minutes. Teams are giving too much to some of these older guys in my opinion (not the Lakers necessarily since they’re 1 year deals mostly). We’re going to see some teams stuck on some contracts for guys who fall off the cliff."
Chris Paul is getting 40m at age 40 LOL
"Trae Young, Chris Paul, Kyrie, Jrue, Dame, Steph, Ja Morant, and then I guess it’s who you like more between Lowry, Russ and Conley for 8th.  Some might also like those guys over Ja but I thought Ja took a major leap near the end of last season and it could be me just projecting how good he could be."
"&gt;Suns were down 2-1 to the Lakers and were losing game 4 before AD went out. And that's with everyone healthy on the Suns while the Lakers had LeBron, AD, and KCP hobbled.  But chris paul was injured for games 2 and 3?  He played like shit he had a shoulder injury"
Derozan getting a smaller contract and less money per year than Chris Paul.
Chris Paul coming in hot.
“Fuck that”  -Chris Paul
"Obviously I don't watch them as much as my own team, but I don't think it's unreasonable to say that they underperformed as a team. Kawhi left and that sucks, but he didn't win that championship alone; the Raps have still had a pretty solid roster, and in what's supposed to be the weaker conference. You look at a vet PG improving a team like Chris Paul did with the Suns, and you'd expect that Lowry would have led the Raptors to a little more success the past two years.  I'm not arguing that Kyle Lowry = Chris Paul, but with how favorable the consensus opinion has been on the Heat acquiring Lowry has been (and compared to some of the mixed reactions to anybody acquiring CP3 for the last 4-5 years given his injury history and relationship with father time), you'd think he was supposed to be."
"Even if he shoot them efficiently, he's not good enough at it and other aspects of the game to compromise better players on your roster. Kawhi Leonard and Chris Paul are similarly efficient midrange monsters but offer way more than that.  If he could shoot 3s, then he'd be easier to accommodate or he'd be a better player and everyone else would accommodate him."
"Let’s go to 2009-2011ish  LeBron   Kobe  Wade  Dwight  Chris Paul  Dirk  Deron Williams.   Melo.   Duncan  Nash  Bosh  Amare  Just off the top of my head, In any order that was the top 12 right? Feel like Melo could’ve creeped into the top 7, maybe top 5 especially after the 09 playoffs"
If he plays as long as Chris Paul he might sign a 3rd $200 M contract
Oh boy. Reminds me of when Warriors fans tried to equate the Iguodala injury to Chris Paul in the 2018 WCF.
"Unfortunately , Chris Paul will no longer be able to join the Lakers . So we need a worthy 5th member of the banana boat crew. I suggest … Mario Chalmers!"
"Chris Paul had a fucked up shoulder for that entire series and being down 2-1 doesn't mean anything, Suns still might've won that series even if AD was playing. Bucks just won the Finals after being down 2-0.   This was also their first go around in the playoffs, they'll be better next year."
This makes Chris Paul look small time.
"You don't need to imagine, you could just ask Chris Paul what it's like"
"I mean they don't have chips, but that doesn't make their legacies worse.  I'd rather have Chris Paul or Steve Nash as my PG, than Tony Parker or Dereck Fisher.  If you put any of AI, CP3 or Nash on teams that suited them best for their skillset for at least 5 years, each of them would have at least one chip.  What if CP3 made it to the Lakers way back in the day? In 2011 Kobe was still on top of his game, and Pau was still an All-Star with around 19 and 10 averages. They can definitely get over the Mavs, let alone win at least one game in that series."
"Chris Paul was also like a missed 3 or two away from it, was he not?"
Big Dicking Chris Paul pretty hard.
"He was never on the boat. It was LeBron, Chris Paul, Wade, and Gabrielle Union"
"Lmao I wish you warriors fans who Tru to equate iguadola to Chris Paul would also mention that LRMAM wasn’t able to play either, and he’s comparable to iggy. Not Paul.  Also, Paul/harden had a tough time on offense even without iguadola, so that’s a stupid point."
He can thank Chris Paul  I think
"The same Chris Paul who, as the head of the NBPA, essentially colluded with the owners to give them a sweetheart revenue deal in return for massive veteran supermax contracts which coincidentally matches his (and VP LeBron's) expiring contracts and ages EXACTLY so he can maximize his own earnings while screwing over the hundred plus rank and file role players and journeyman players in the league?   Chris Paul isn't even on the side of his fellow players. He wouldn't give a single shit about the fans. The NBA may well start losing revenue, but that will be 10 years from now when him and his banana boat buddies are fat, rich, and retired."
"Yeah this was actually a bit of a rough series for him overall in terms of shooting(he was much better in 2019, but that year Chris Paul played poorly)"
"I wish people who mentioned the CP3 injury would also remember the Iguodala injury. It's not just that Chris Paul ""just happened"" to go off in game 4, and that the Warrior offense ""just happened"" to struggle.   It's that the Warriors had Iguodala on CP3 defensively, and were using him as an offensive fulcrum because Curry was being grabbed like crazy.  So basically he goes out, and the entire structure of both the Warrior offense and defense has to switch."
Series averages:  Kevin Durant: 30/6/3 on 46/40/89 shooting(60% TS)  Stephen Curry: 25/7/6 on 47/36/86 shooting(58% TS)  James Harden: 29/6/6 on 42/24/89 shooting(54% TS)  Chris Paul: 20/7/4 on 41/37/75 shooting(52% TS)
"Chris paul to lakers. I mean, i had no idea trades could be rejected by the league. THAT was truly unexpected."
Chris Paul for Westbrook
Chris Paul is one of the greatest to ever play the position lmaoooooo
K. Chris Paul did too. Worked out I think
Idk how people can get mad at him it's not like he's laying down on top of people like James Harden or punching people in the nuts like Chris Paul  Also those passes man my god
fuck chris paul but im cool with the suns
"Dirk was never the best player or in the running. Chris Paul only in 2008, where can I buy what you’re smoking bro?"
I haven't heard much about Dekker since he was traded for Chris Paul.
Have you seen the suns rosters before Chris Paul?
Ask Chris Paul or russel Westbrook if they felt “elevated”
"2018  Up 3-2 on the warriors (obviously Chris Paul got hurt)  Game 6: Rockets up by 17 after 1st quarter, up by 10 at halftime. Somehow ended up losing by 29. In the 4th quarter, Harden had 0 points (0/2 FGs), 2 turnovers, 1 assist, -15 +/-. Warriors outscored the rockets 31-9 in the 4th quarter.  Game 7: Blew another double digit halftime lead, this time 11 points. Harden contributed 10 of the 27 straight missed 3s.  2020  vs OKC game 7: Harden had 17 points, 4 turnovers on 4/15 shooting (1/9 from 3). Got bailed out because Westbrook, Covington, and Gordon all scored 20+ this game.   Vs Lakers  Wins game 1 then loses 4 straight. Harden disappeared in the 4th every game. His point totals in the 4th were 5, 5, 5, 6, and 3. Rockets were winning by 2 going into the 4th quarter of game 2, then lost by 10 (Harden 5 points). Rockets were tied going into the 4th quarter of game 3, then lost by 10 (Harden 5 points)"
Mitchell beat Okc with Russ and George his rookie year. Book didn’t even sniff the playoffs until he got Chris Paul
Chris Paul could've taken so much of the load off Kobe and then he probably would've never torn his Achilles :(
Luka hasn’t played with Westbrook Chris Paul or Dwight Howard. Just a shell of porzingiz.
"From the list, #9 and #10 in order:  &gt;James Harden - 63.51%   &gt;Chris Paul - 62.59%  Just crazy neither one of them has won a chip, even crazier after seeing this stat."
"&gt;guys like chris paul and embiid are not on lebrons level tho. they have the stats, but not the success  This is the issue. Career success is irrelevant if we're talking about who is top1/top10 right now. Sixers were more successful than the Lakers this post season."
"Chris Paul, frowning aggressively."
"no. maybe he used to be, but he’s being asked to do stuff no one else could even do. losing in 2017-18 isn’t a ‘choke’ cause chris got injured and he was playing the best team of all time. not even lebron could win one game by himself against them, 2018-19 he matched durants numbers and won us those two houston games, but chris paul was extremely weak. 2019-20 he was good. could’ve been more aggressive instead of passing out of the double and standing at half but that isn’t choking. westbrook just couldn’t take over. last year pretty self explanatory"
Isn't Chris Paul the first player to lose 4 Playoff series' from being 2-0 up?     Not very clutch.
"You cant even name 10 players that are arguably better than lebron. giannis, kd, harden, steph are all contenders. I'd add jokic and kawhi as mvp and fmvp. guys like chris paul and embiid are not on lebrons level tho. they have the stats, but not the success"
"Peja got hurt in 2006 and Chris Paul wasn’t an MVP level player yet. Having the same names on the roster doesn’t necessarily mean that the team is on the same level. As for 2009, Peja declined as a player and Chandler went in and out of the line up with injuries all year."
"I mean, that’d be like saying Cliff Paul and Chris Paul are the same person. That just doesn’t make sense but the internet may believe it."
"I don’t think the suns make finals if clippers are healthy, but doesn’t change the fact that we got beat by Chris paul"
"Chris Paul, Chris Ford, Chris Mullin, Chris Webber, Chris Bosh"
"There's actual video of the exchange in which he allegedly said it, and Curry never confirmed it.   However, Lakers fans and Warriors fans love to trash him just because he was on the Clippers.  It's not like I am defending his pushing of Chris Paul or his sketchy ""attempted steal"" on Westbrook. I recognize he can be a sketchy player on occasion. There's just no corroboration anywhere that he actually said this."
"But that isn't the part of what u/thelastsaiyanprince that I am responding to.   He said he would take 2001 Allen over MOST GUARDS...   I am giving him the benefit of the doubt and excluding top 10 to 20 greats.   So that would mean he is taking him over Chris Paul, Isiah Thomas, etc."
"Depends on how you look at it. The Hornets sucked, so there isn’t much to be said about that part of his career. In 2012, the Clippers lost to the Spurs, who were better than them. In 2013, they lost to the Grizzlies more due to Blake Griffin underperforming than Chris Paul.  In 2014, they lost to the Thunder partly due to Paul fucking up and partly due to the Thunder being better than them. In 2015, that 3-1 choke was able to occur because CP3 missed the first two games of the series (including a loss by 6 points). They lost in 2016 and 2017 because of injuries. Then he got traded to the Rockets and got injured there in 2018 before just sucking in 2019. Then he got booted to the Thunder where most people didn’t even think he was going to make the playoffs before losing in the first round. This man lost 4 opportunities in a row at one point that could be pointed towards injuries. The only times you can really say it was CP3’s fault are 2014 and 2019. The rest of the years are either on other people or injuries."
"I love the way you said ""But CP3 is their second best player and Andre is like their 5th"" Like that isn't a legit argument man! Without Ander 1 team still has 4 All Stars without Chris Paul the other has 1."
"You guys were on the brink of losing to the Rockets before Chris Paul got hurt, maybe you were the best team but you also benefitted from injuries. Ditto for 2015 if you want to count the years prior to KD joining."
Chris Paul the only older guy still playing at a all-star level so it's him obviously.
"Chris Paul, Chris Mullin, Chris Webber, Chris Bosh, Chris Boucher"
"Chris Paul, Kris Dunn, Chris Silva, Khris Middleton, Chris Boucher"
Chris Paul
koia? so chris paul is gonna fight food injustice by committing injustice against food?
Chris Paul  Year 1 fully guaranteed   Year 2 fully guaranteed   Year 3 50% guaranteed   Year 4 team option
PG: Chris Paul SG: Jordan SF: Kawhi PF: KD C: KAT
"Chris Paul looked washed in 2019. They lost key role players because Fertitta is cheap, and it looked like CP3 regressed. They clearly peaked in 2018"
Harden and Chris Paul at 9th and 10th active players is so fitting.
 They tried trading 4 FRP and EG for Jimmy Butler after that 2018 season and they said no. Chris Paul had the worst season of his career in 2019 after getting injured on the biggest stage. We gambled with russ because there was no other contracts that matched and that didn’t work either. Tillman also refuses to spend money in 2019 and that’s what pushed harden out
"I think to close to guarantee you need a top 25 player who is preferably a scorer. I’m gonna say devin booker, Chris Paul, Westbrook, are players I feel comfortable with leasing a team to the final 4 no problem."
Chris Paul continues his fight to get richer.  FTFY.
Chris Paul wasn't injured in 2019. I'm going to ignore the rest of your essay.
Yada Yada Giannis isnt good on the perimeter (Please ignore him repeatedly shutting down Chris Paul and Devin Booker on the perimeter in the finals a month ago) yada yada
Chris Paul didn’t play
"Really? Better than Chris Paul, Westbrook and Kevin Durant?"
Up against a Suns team with an injured Chris Paul*   Would’ve been a fun series that could’ve gone either way if everyone was healthy. It would’ve been like a WCF in the first round
"And people blame Chris Paul for not being healthy? If anything, it reinforces the truth; CP3’s teams don’t show up when it matters the most. Looking at numbers shows he does (most of the time at least).   This was practically a title lost, assuming CP3 comes back for the next series, though Cleveland could have nabbed the chip here as well. At least the Finals would have been fresh."
"Chris Paul might be seen as better than Westbrook now, but in 18-19 he had a down year and was 34. Completely reasonable to think they thought they were upgrading by trading him. No one knew a dude in his mid 30's with an injury history was going to have a little bit of a resurgence."
Yeah you absolutely could’ve predicted cp3 would be better than Russ after2019. Most of this sub predicted that. So no I don’t agree with your statements. Chris Paul and James harden is such a good pairing they could’ve won in the bubble too. They would’ve given the lakers a serious run for their money and I say that as a lebron fan
You conveniently left out the reason they peaked is mainly cause James forced them to trade Chris Paul and picks for Westbrook. We all saw what cp3 did with okc and PHX. They could’ve won together but James forced him to be traded.  So yes it’s reasonable without giving any context whatsover
"I wouldn't say better.   Kyrie, Steph, Chris Paul, Lillard, up until recently John Wall  They're all under 6'5. Wouldn't you say they're the most skilled players right now?"
"terry is not a top 10-15 starting guard lmao what   Off top of the head Curry, Dame, Kyrie, Lowry, Chris Paul, Booker, Harden, Jrue, Trae, Fox, Morant,  FVV, Brogdon, Westbrook, Conley, Mitchell, Jamal Murray are all easily better and that’s not even counting point forwards   his last contract looked like an overpay and then he played at the level of the contract, that doesn’t mean he should get overpaid *again*"
"Good ol’ Shovey McBacks. You know, two things I never thought I’d say prior to this year were “Hey, don’t hurt Chris Paul” and “Those guys really shouldn’t hang Mike Pence” but here we are."
Chris Paul in shambles rn
"There's nuance to it, though, it's not a straight like-for-like comparison. Nobody says Andre Iguodala is as good as Chris Paul, or that they were 100% equally as important to their respective teams.  The Warriors had a chance to essentially put the series to bed with Game 4 at home, but Iguodala was suddenly out and his 27 minutes largely went to Looney and Jordan Bell. And the Warriors blew a 12-point lead in the fourth quarter of G4 that drastically changed the series (2-2 as opposed to 3-1).  Iguodala was a net ratings god for that team; losing his minutes and having many go to Jordan Bell was hugely impactful considering G4 and G5 were nailbiters that they lost. There is a very good chance the Warriors win in 5, or at least come home for G6 up (rather than down) 3-2, if Iguodala wasn't out after three games."
"&gt;Dude they run the whole damn offence around jokic. He's offence in a can. You can't just neglect the gigantic difference in playmaking. It's like saying CJ McCollum and Chris Paul are similar level players because they both score approximately the same on similar efficiency.   The Wolves run a lot of their offence through KAT also, you should watch more of KAT if you think the comparison is CJ and CP3..."
Dude they run the whole damn offence around jokic. He's offence in a can. You can't just neglect the gigantic difference in playmaking. It's like saying CJ McCollum and Chris Paul are similar level players because they both score approximately the same on similar efficiency.
&gt;I can't look up the stat   I got you mate  Smart is at .94 PPP as the PnR ball handler. Same as FVV and Fox slightly worse than Tatum and Chris Paul better than Brooklyn Harden and Herro
"Lol our 2018 team won 65 games and was 50-5 healthy. Chris Paul in 2019 was worse in every way and got traded right after. He was at an all time low. We had also lost key role players.  We were up 3-2 in 2018, Paul plays, we win"
"We had one shot creator on our team in James Harden. The rest of the guys are spot-up shooters with little to no shot creation ability. What exactly do you want the Rockets to do at that point? Sure, we could try and run a Trevor Ariza high PnR or go to a Clint Capela post-up, but that's obviously not going to end well. Our team was specifically built to play one way, and that was through Chris Paul/James Harden isolations that led to baskets for those two or kick-outs for open 3s. If you have an issue with the roster construction not providing room to adapt, then that's fair, but you can't make a trade for another shot creator during the middle of a game 7. We didn't have the ability to revamp our offense on the fly so sticking to our guns was the best option we had at winning that game.  We also shot 44 3s which was in-line with our season and playoff averages. It's not like we chucked up 60+ threes and completely ignored attacking the basket. We ran our normal offense and just didn't hit the 3s we took. At the end of the day, we lost by 9. If we only have a horrific percentage from 3 (4/27) instead of a completely catastrophic percentage (0/27) then we win that game."
He has the same % at the rim as Chris Paul
"Um... Ok. But did you watch the games? If you are wanting to win championships, i don't know how you go with Harden (and I am NOT a Kobe fan). Harden is incredibly talented, and has an unbelievable ability to get buckets (for himself and others), but when it is winning time, nothing I've seen in Harden would convince me to take him over Kobe. Superior #s don't win games or titles. With Kobe, I know he'd rather die than lose. With Harden-- not so sure. Watch him quit against the Clippers. Watch him fall apart against the Spurs and Warriors (repeatedly). Shoot, if I want to win, I'd take inefficient and more limited (physical stature, worse shooter and passer) Allen Iverson over Harden. I'd take Chris Paul over Harden. I won't argue with you if you want to say Harden's offensive repertoire may be more complete/efficient than Kobe's, but to say you'd take him because his playoff numbers are better... C'mon bruh. With Kobe, you have a chance. Any team, any matchup, any year. Watch Harden vs. Lakers in 2020 and tell me your legit thought he was a better playoff performer than Kobe. (and no, I'm a Jordan/Bulls fan, not a Laker fan). Harden is just too ""okay"" with losing."
If Chris Paul plays this doesn’t happen and we win soo
"Your arbitrary ""muh 50+ win teams"" stats is meaningless. Nobody cares that the Rockets beat the 51-31 Jazz or that the Lakers beat the 50-32 Nuggets. That's to be expected of contending teams.   &gt; He's won 3 series against 50+ win opponents, but I'm supposed to believe he's better than Kobe who's won 25 series against 50+ win opponents  No, you're supposed to look at each player's performances and determine which is better instead of comparing players in vastly different contexts with ""muh wins.""   If you gave James Harden players like Shaquille O'Neal and Pau Gasol, he'd have won a few championships too lol. You neglected to mention how many of Kobe's wins against 50+ win opponents came next to a top ten player of all time and that the only time James Harden really had a transcendent second option was one year of Chris Paul (and we all know how injuries fucked that up)."
"It wasn't the same team. We lost Trevor Ariza and replaced hime with no one. Lost additional wing depth. And by far most importantly, Chris Paul was a shell of the player he was the year before. Our record that year reflected this. We were 65-17 in 2018 and only 53-29 in 2019.  In 2019, Chris Paul had career lows in PPG, VORP, BPM, WS/48, PER, and TOV%. It was also the worst TS% he had since his second year in the league. He was making uncharacteristically poor turnovers and he couldn't beat anybody off-the-dribble in isolation to save his life. It looked like he had fallen off a cliff due to age. There was a reason people said he had the worst contract in the league at that time."
"How many teams even currently have their best player as a point guard? Irving isn't, Chris Paul is arguable but no, Westbrook definitely isn't now.  Unless you are calling Doncic or Harden a point guard like you sometimes see to fill out PG lists it's a bunch of middling teams and then only 3. Steph, Dame, and Trae. And if Trae Young is a superstar it's very new argument (that I don't buy)."
I clown him for pushing Chris Paul after he got beat.
"All the Chris Paul revisionism the past year, yea."
chris paul 100% did
Jokic is elite but LeBron is also. Luka is more like harden or Westbrook   Jokic is more like LeBron or Chris Paul
Chris Paul was a lot worse in 2019 though. It wasn’t the same team
"2019: What if I told you the very next year you'd have a healthy Chris Paul, and injured KD, and the Rockets still lose?  If you ran a 1000 simulations, the rockets win some of them, but you know the majority of the time they are getting beat or stomped by that stacked warriors team. 2018 was just one of the examples where they got close and fell short.  Rockets got outscored by 9ppg and Harden shot under 25% from 3. If Harden plays like he does in the regular season, they win that series probably."
"To some extent that's true but there will always be players like Chris Paul, Trae young, and Kyle Lowry that are ~6'0"" but with ball skills and basketball IQ that make them more valuable than many players that are larger and more athletic."

Smart’s been selected for 1st team all defense twice (each of the two seasons before this one).   Other guards currently in the league who have 2 first team selections include  * Paul George * Rondo * Jrue Holiday * Ben Simmons   The list of guards who’ve made more than 2 is  * Chris Paul  That’s it. So no I don’t think there are that many guards out there who have Smart’s skillset.
AND Chris Paul wasn’t playing. God that shit pisses me off
First oddly enough those three players you picked don't win games. Booker did with  Chris Paul and they will if they continue develop and their FO builds the right complimentary pieces but sixers are competing now. But the larger point is youre high if you think Naz is that level--Ant is on that level but let's not pretend Naz is in the running to be best scoring wing in the league. Anything can happen but be serious. Also the point is you need to replace Ben's production or (improve it.) Getting the Wolves 5th man and bench players doesn't do that.
Literally the only reason you got James Harden. Lmfao.   And Chris Paul. And sort of Russell Westbrook too.   Also the same reason you have years of the lottery coming up too.
Yes.  Anything that happened in New Orleans (or OKC when they had to move because of Hurricane Katrina) belongs to the Pelicans.  So Chris Paul is 100 percent a New Orleans Pelican.
Chris Paul and Rondo are probably still not fond of each other. But that's not like an argument that got out of hand and egos are too bruised to make up. That's more like... recession to the mean consists of each asshole not liking the other asshole and all else is temporary.
"How do you know that? You think Chris Paul wouldn’t have looked for the best team to join just cause the Warriors were still great but not as good?   And the Cavs beat them the year before, proceeded to get better and went 12-1 in the playoffs. Meanwhile the Warriors in this situation would’ve had a worst record and replaced KD with Danny Green."
"That is way too high. Top 35-40 are players like Chris Paul, Patrick Ewing, Paul Pierce, or Steve Nash."
You took a big step up when you traded for Chris Paul. Swapping TJ for Rubio didn't make you guys a great team.
"Some good points here for sure, and a few things to respond to.  &gt; I think we mostly agree on why he's not as popular as he could be. There are lots of slight disadvantages that add up in aggregate. There are definitely some counterexamples to those disadvantages (for example Giannis is a foreign big man in a small market and he still does well) but I see where you're coming from.  I think there is a markedly different destinction between Giannis and Gobert, or Jokic, or Embiid. While Giannis may be big and play at the 5 sometimes, he is an entirely different type of player. He may be the singularly most athletic player in the entire league. He's as fast as a guard, as strong as a center, and is as explosive and jumps as high as anyone. That is an entirely different category of guy compared to what would be considered a big man. The same reason why I don't think you could call LeBron a big man because he plays the 4, or KD because he plays some 4 and is 7ft tall. Athletically and stylistically on a different planet than the others. I also think that Giannis is not marketed as much as he would be if he were a domestic player. The guy is the ideal playstyle and personality to make the face of the league, and while he's assuredly more popular than Jokic, he is not in that Steph/LBJ/KD tier like he should rightly be.   &gt; There may also be other reasons, but you need to look at the source of those arguments/conversations and get that their job is to have something to talk about. The NBA is a narrative driven league and it does nothing for viewership if there's no narrative. The NBA all else equal would prefer having MVP controversy over just a runaway winner and would obviously prefer to have Chris Paul as an MVP over Jokic. He's on like every third commercial, if he's in the conversation that's good for business. It's definitely not fair, but the NBA is at it's core an entertainment business and I can't blame people for playing the game.  Don't get me wrong, I fully understand why it is that they do this, I just think it's awful. This is a relatively modern practice of creating divisiveness, drama, storylines, and saying incendiary things to illicit a reaction; and it's not just blowhard local radio jockies and SAS/Skip anymore. Every single network and nearly every single program has people(s) doing this for every sport.   It's not honest, nor fair, and Jokic is lucky that this is just on court stuff because there are guys who have lost money and reputation based off these blood suckers creating false narratives. There's a distinct line between marketing the best players, putting them on commercials and using them as the face of the league, and putting down other players or being dishonest or dismissive of them to help achieve that same goal.  As much as the fans hate it, the players seem to hate it even more. But hate drives interaction, diviseness creates reactions, and the biggest networks have decided that the best way to generate user engagement and attention is to say the wildest stuff possible regardless of it being true or not. I'm not even sure if that's the best model anymore, but they are hyper slow to evolve. So yeah, I get why they're doing it, but when viewership and engagement comes at the cost of a player's reputation, or legacy, and therefore in some cases their money--we're getting into some pretty unethical stuff.   &gt; BBall Ref stuff.  I understand how the tracker works and such, and I suppose I'm just using it as the cleanest way to illustrate that it's not as if LeBron or Embiid were strides above Jokic and Jokic just happened to lap them when they went down. That's how people have treated this MVP in general. I also appreciate it for the very reason that it has no narrative driven bias, which is something I truly hate. Narratives are wholly subjective in how impressive or valuable they are.  [Realistically if we look at Embiid and Jokic](https://puu.sh/I4SUh/a0df669c71.png) from right around where Embiid got hurt, it's hard not to say that the voters were not just swayed by the amateurish knowledge that Embiid was leading the league in PPG on a #1 seed team, and the false belief that Jokic ""only plays one side of the ball"". In reality Jokic was scoring better than Embiid in that Embiid averaged 6 more FTs a game to pput up 3 more points. They were equal rebounders. Jokic was top 3 in the league at steals this point, and went on to have the best points saved per PnR possession in the league among bigs. I believe he was leading them both in BPM, VORP, WS/48, and Embiid was #1 in PER.   As far as defense goes certainly Embiid is a better defender, no denying that, but people treat him like he's Gobert on defense and all of the numbers (defensive analytics, gross, but...) had him top 10 but guys like Poeltl, Capela, Giannis, Robinson, Draymond, Bam, were above him in a lot of those stats during the year. For what it's worth Jokic also led him in DWS and DBPM, but I'd use that to suggest that Jokic is a much more solid defender than people think rather than him being better than Embiid. Because he isn't.    Then you factor in being top 3 in the league in assists as well, and the disparity of talent between the two teams, People don't pay attention to Denver like they do Philly, or the Lakers, and so they aren't factoring in that MPJ was out with covid most of this time, injuries all over the place, huge minutes for a 5'9"" rookie foreign PG. They aren't looking at the steep decline in productivity on both ends of the floor for Embiid in the 4th quarter. They just aren't *really* looking at who deserves it.   I honestly believe that until they're about a month out from voting that most of the voters have done nearly zero research or thought into who should be the MVP, and even then we see how insane some ballots are at the end of the year. Every year there's some guy putting Drummond on 1st team all-defense, or puts CP3 over Doncic for 1st team. So, again, I really take very little away from polling NBA voters in regards to who deserves to win.   &gt; Jokic deserves somewhere in between the calls that he gets and the calls that Nuggets fans think he should get. He's for sure on the low side, but I've seen people say ""imagine how good he would be if he got Embiid's whistle"". There's a reason he doesn't get Embiid's whistle, drawing fouls is a skill and Embiid's one of the best in the league at it.  I agree that there's some sort of middle ground here, but there's a distinction to make as well. I agree that Embiid is great at drawing fouls, but I don't think that he is necessarily fouled more than Jokic is. As an aside point I think Embiid should do a lot less of that because him falling to the ground as a gigantic injury prone guy to help sell a foul is ultimately going to do more harm than good. You can only fall so many times at that height and not get some sort of accumulating injury. Jokic, for the most part, simply will not fall unless he is literally being made to fall. The guys plays in the way that is most safe for him and I'm thankful for that because it makes him a tank, but naturally he will get less foul calls because his theatrics can't be as theatrical.   Just to be Nikola's lawyer for a brief moment, [stuff like this is not uncommon.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h8tF_bqISw) The guy keeps the ball up very high most of the time and the majority of the fouls that refs are missing are him getting his arms whacked like pool noodles, to the point where every game it looks like he was a training dummy for police dogs. [Every single game there is at least a couple possessions exactly like this with no call.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDvjrflK9Ao) You expect that for bigs sometimes, but refs consistently ""missing"" this every single game is absurdity. I want to just be the insane biased fan not realizing that other teams star bigs get called like this too, but it just isn't like that. Our coach, and players, and GM, can only question so many times why he isn't getting foul calls. It's been years of the entire organization subtly and not so subtly calling it out and there is no change. It's infuriating. It's clearly more than not drawing or selling fouls, and I don't know what it is or why it is, but I've moved past thinking it has to be some sort of fan-bias conspiracy.   Anyway, good points, good chat. Glad to have a respectful chat across the big man DMZ."
"Harden's Rockets got closed out Warriors without Steph, by the Spurs without Kawhi or Tony Parker, and then by the Warriors without KD.  But they also have a very good shot at beating a healthy Warriors team if they don't get closed out with Chris Paul injured. Just once can we see a full-health matchup here?"
"This was his best year from midrange, shooting-wise. He's shot over 50% from midrange exactly *once* in his career before this, in his sophomore season, on two attempts per game. Chris Paul does it damn near every year, on *way* higher volume. They're just talking out of their ass."
"In this same vein, Chris Paul is very likely to climb to #3 all time in assists and could make it to #4 for steals…"
Chris Paul
They had Chris Paul before that
They forget when they were abt to lose before Chris Paul went down though. Conveniently

"That’s what he does at the end of games. He “acts” like he is fighting to get open but in reality he is clinging onto defenders to actually keep them close to him so that he doesn’t get the pass. He shies away from the big moments.   Chris Paul after this game said “some players shy away from the big moments, some players look for them” or something to that extent. It almost felt like an indirect message to harden."
"No it only increases scoring efficiency of role players. As seen by Chris Paul, Kawhi and KD stars can still feast with a heavy diet of midrange and long 2s. The scoring difference is pretty exclusively role players trading long 2s for 3pt shots. MJ benefitted from the same spacing because of the illegal defence rule.  Hell MJ even had years with a shortened 3pt line.  So yes you can compare them either by using relative TS which Favours MJ due to how hard it is to increase TS past a certain point. Or just by realising how far ahead curry was over everyone else in the league. And how far ahead he still will be. Until the guys who were 5 in 2016 come into the league."
"Sorry you’re getting downvoted. This is a legit basketball question for, what I assume to be, a new fan.  There’s no rule that players have to pass half court but the whole team doesn’t do it because that would require a lot of running. They call it a press and once the press is broken (offense reaches a point where the defense is chasing instead of guarding) it becomes much harder to prevent a basket. For most of the game, it’s generally better to try to limit it to half court defense. There are some exceptions, like last years playoffs, where teams would have one defender press Chris Paul so that he had to work harder to get the ball up. The other 4 players got back and were prepared to help though, so it wasn’t the typical full court press."

"You gave me a lot to run through, here's my attempt.  I think we mostly agree on why he's not as popular as he could be. There are lots of slight disadvantages that add up in aggregate. There are definitely some counterexamples to those disadvantages (for example Giannis is a foreign big man in a small market and he still does well) but I see where you're coming from.  &gt;I think Nuggets fans/Jokic fans should probably be okay with it at the end of the day because it really does seem like he doesn't care or actively doesn't want to be marketed and be in the public eye like that. But speaking for myself it is a bit frustrating when it gets to the point where because he isn't a marketable player that he is underappreciated, undervalued, and purposefully devalued/disrespected by some of the media.   &gt;   &gt;I mean there was a stretch of a few weeks there where they were PRESSING an argument/conversation about CP3 being more deserving of the MVP than Jokic. TV talking heads tried to find every single angle to do everything except say that Jokic was the MVP until he was a week away from nearly winning it unanimously.   &gt;   &gt;That's so frustrating for someone who roots for Jokic because it's like why? Why do that? Would that happen to any other player in the league? Is there another player in the entire league that could have put up the numbers he did and people aren't calling it what it was, one of the greatest offensive seasons of all time?   There may also be other reasons, but you need to look at the source of those arguments/conversations and get that their job is to have something to talk about. The NBA is a narrative driven league and it does nothing for viewership if there's no narrative. The NBA all else equal would prefer having MVP controversy over just a runaway winner and would obviously prefer to have Chris Paul as an MVP over Jokic. He's on like every third commercial, if he's in the conversation that's good for business. It's definitely not fair, but the NBA is at it's core an entertainment business and I can't blame people for playing the game.  &gt;Even now there was so much of this ""well if x and y weren't injured, Jokic wouldn't have gotten it"", ""he just played every game that's why he deserves it, and that's important too so let's agree that's why but also give credit for his MVP mostly to being healthy for 82 games"", and it's like no. No. What world are we in?  I agree that the ""best ability is availability"" angle is a bad one, Jokic had an amazing season regardless of how much he played. He has many better abilities than his availability and should be lauded for those. I'm biased in my own way so I think Embiid would have won the MVP had he stayed healthy, but he didn't, and there's no way to know what would have happened.  &gt;Before Embiid or LBJ even got injured Jokic had a -sizeable- lead in the Bballref MVP tracker as the odds on favorite/most deserving. That's not gospel or anything but that thing never fails to get the winner right and is pretty close to getting the top 5. But forever there will be this bogus narrative of Jokic only winning the MVP because people got hurt, which is absolutely ridiculous.  I agree that the narrative that Jokic **only** won because of others being injured is absolutely ridiculous. As I just said, he had an amazing season outside of whatever anyone else did. However, while I'm a big fan of the the bballref MVP tracker, I think you're misrepresenting what it does and as you said it's not gospel.  1. The MVP tracker is meant to look at past voting patterns and predict who might win MVP based on metrics that have been predictive in the past. It's an algorithm that's based on the votes of actual voters, says nothing about who's ""most deserving"", ignores all narrative (as I just described, the NBA is very narrative driven), etc. 2. To the point of it not being gospel, there is a source that actually is gospel, and that's the voters themselves. The algorithm is trying to predict what the voters will do, but a better source is to ask the actual voters. Luckily there's a straw poll conducted a few times a year that gives us a sense as to what the voters are thinking. Before Embiid got injured he was ahead of Jokic both in that straw poll and in voting odds which aren't as great of a source in my opinion, but can't be ignored. Based on that, I believe Embiid and LeBron were ahead of Jokic when they respectively got injured. Doesn't mean they necessarily would have stayed ahead, although I believe Embiid would have. (I can provide sources for either if you want, just don't feel like looking them up right now)  &gt;Everyone wants their favorite/best player to get the credit and respect that they really deserve, and I know I'm biased but it definitely feels like Jokic gets the least respect out of any superstar that I can think of in all my years of watching the NBA; and worse it seems to extend to games as well, to the point where even in game threads the other team's fans will share a moment with us of being like ""alright well Jokic is getting hammered and they won't call a foul for him, damn, bad reffing"", and it's been years of that. I wish I was just being a stupid biased fan about that, but even a few years ago when 538 did their ""player who gets the worst whistle"" article Jokic was at the top of it. So the guy can't even get superstar love in the NBA.   &gt;   &gt;It sucks. We're all just frustrated. The marketability is what it is, we have to accept that, but the fact that it seems to bleed over into the media's narrative around Jokic and the league's(?) attitude towards him is the real irksome thing.  Yeah, that's all understandable, and for a multitude of reasons it's probably worse for Jokic than it would be for other guys. Even something as simple as not being able to jump very high hurts him more than it probably should. I would think that it's easier to spot contact up high versus down low.  Jokic deserves somewhere in between the calls that he gets and the calls that Nuggets fans think he should get. He's for sure on the low side, but I've seen people say ""imagine how good he would be if he got Embiid's whistle"". There's a reason he doesn't get Embiid's whistle, drawing fouls is a skill and Embiid's one of the best in the league at it.  Anyway, that's enough from me, I'm a Sixers fan so hopefully you understand that I'm also coming from a biased perspective. Also, I only found [this](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-nba-team-is-wronged-by-the-refs-the-most/) fivethirtyeight article which includes Jokic but not at the top. I'd be open to reading the one you're talking about though, love fivethirtyeight."
Gonna give that shove to Chris Paul again so he can back up Pat Bev as starting PG
"This is just really not true. When it comes to being a lotto pick or superstar, you're right. But there's plenty of role players that aren't genetically gifted other than their height. If you're above 6'1 you've cleared the biggest genetic hurdle already. Current day Chris Paul for example is not too far off average height, and is nearing 40 so he's lost a huge amount of lateral quickness and athleticism in general, and he's still way more valuable than those far bigger ""gifted"" athletes coming in. Because of his mind and decision making."
"There are 14 players with 2 or more MVPs. 16 if you include ABA (which had most of that eras top players), and would be at least  one more if the award existed the first 10 years of the league.   FMVP is a joke of an award that has been given out to players who didn't deserve it on multiple occasions. One at least one occasion it literally went to someone that the voters didn't vote for.  Shaq at least probably should have won more than one MVP, Kobe's one arguably should have gone to Chris Paul.  Kobe's strongest argument is longevity. At no point in time was he the best player in the league, and wasn't the best player on his own team for at least 3 and arguably 4 of his rings.  He's not top 10, and probably not top 15."
"LeBron, Steph, KD, Harden, AD,  Kawhi, Prime Westbrook, Chris Paul, Dame  Who are we taking off to add Draymond shooting 3s?"
Uh lets not forget how he tries to knock out players before getting eliminated. Last year almost injuring murray and this year shoving chris paul when he isnt looking.
chris paul vs curry. reigning wc champs vs recent 5x wc champs.
Marquese Chris Paul George Karl Malone
Chris Paul and James Harden gotta do one of these and talk about what could’ve been...
Damn it. These guys are all taller. Well then I guess Avery Bradley is the best option. Or Chris Paul defensively too
"I think Pat Bev gets too much hate but ""never makes a selfish play""? His last moment as a clipper was him losing his cool and shoving Chris Paul"
"it is for someone like Chris Paul. in comparison:  1,5 TPG vs lakers 1,3 TPG vs nuggets 2,0 TPG vs clippers"
Chris Paul has his way with him too
Chris Paul was ridiculous
Well why is he never able to elevate the level of his teamates then ?  He had good teams in OKC and was never able to get past the first round without KD.  Chris paul with an inferior supporting cast managed to lead that OKC team to a better record than Westbrook ever could and that tells you everything you need to know about him.
"**For humor:** Jokic, Embiid,   **For knowledge**: Chris Paul, Jimmy Butler  And Klay is a fun guest one too"
Chris Paul makes every team better.
GTFO calling Jokic MVP. Chris Paul is ahead of him on that list.
"Chris Paul really stuffs the the ole knickerbockers, if you know what I mean."
You need to stop acting like you know Chris Paul
"Ehh I think you are kinda underselling Bridges and Johnson, who are both fantastic shot makers in their own right.  And also underestimating Chris Paul, who is simply a notably better playmaker than Conley, Clarkson, or Bogdon.  Similarly, Ayton is a similar threat to Gobert.  The combo of CP3/Bridges/Johnson/Ayton is really not notably worse than Bojan/Clarkson/Conley/Gobert imo, at least on the offensive end.  There really isn't a huge difference between the role players surrounding them, and CP3 is the clear best of all the surrounding players in terms of helping lead and create on offense."
I love chris Paul on every team except the lob city clippers. Was so happy when they finally broke up.
The dankest time line would be Chris Paul finally winning the championship with the Suns without the expectations of years past.
Yeah thats some chris paul type shit right there lol
Regardless his numbers aren't as efficient and he puts up like 25 shots a game. Kyrie averaging a near 50-40-90 season and Chris Paul is doing classic Chris Paul stuff reviving the Suns and turning them into a 2 seed.
Chris Paul was on a team that made the playoffs in the West. They were clearly far superior than this Cavs team.
But rj is averaging double the rebounds? I called it a fair split to call them equal. He’s only averaging 3 more assist your making it seem like he’s Chris Paul.  You didn’t even address the 4 seed or the defense too. Rj is playing winning basketball while a year younger than garland. Rj came in as one of the youngest rookies ever because he reclassified. Rj is also averaging only 2% less from three despite being a small forward.
lol I was wondering what the hell they meant when they brought up Chris Paul. Just now realizing they misread Pau as a misspelling haha.

"Chris “Mark Messier” Paul.   You know what, i don’t even follow hockey. I fucking hate it. But still, come be Mark Messier, Chris. You were FILTHY in those last minutes."
A team led by Devin Booker and old Chris Paul isn’t winning the title
4 years from now Booker and SGA will team up to win a ring and we will call that team the successor of Chris Paul
"I had a hard time believing this Suns team would lose 3 in a row, but hard to bet against the Knicks the way they're playing. Tough, well fought game between 2 overachieving squads. EDIT: Also, Chris Paul is money."
Chris Paul is a bad bad man.
"Don't know what guy is on about. Chris Paul put the nail in the coffin for us tonight as expected from a man of his caliber. GGs man, See ya next game."
"If Chris Paul were a couple of inches taller and played a more athletic game, he'd be this year's MVP."
Chris Paul decided it was time to win this game and it didn’t really matter what the Knicks did after that tbh.   Unreal closer.
No hate to Booker but Chris Paul should always have the ball in the clutch. Always.
"Suns just better. Tough shooting for our guys. So cold, but it is what it is. Chris Paul just does that. GG suns"
chris fucking paul...
Its funny. I made a hate team in 2k with harden and kyrie and they have since joined up IRL. I have another team in the same MyLeague thats the knicks with derozan and chris paul.
My god the end of this game was a blast. Chris Paul is a magician.
It took Chris Paul being Chris Paul to put us away. Good game suns proud of my Knicks. We showing we can hang with the best. No burks. No Mitch hopefully games like this makes us more attractive moving forward
Chris Paul why you gotta do us like that?
Was Chris Paul just saving his energy the whole game to put em into those 3 shots at the end?
I want a Chris Paul
I can take solace in the fact that it took Chris Paul activating some black magic fuckery to beat us. GG Suns yall are a great team.
That hurts but nothing you can do about that. Chris Paul still nasty
#CHRIS PAUL RUINED MY NIGHT
Chris Paul ICEY 🥶🥶🥶
I love Chris Paul so much.
Love these annual reminders of why I hate going up against Chris Paul

Joker or Chris Paul
"&gt;And it also helps that literally anywhere within the arc is in Beal's range for a good high-percentage look; he's become one of the best midrange shooters in the league. Beal makes things easy for his point guards. Even if they don't get the ball to him with an open lane to the rim, Beal can stop and pop in the midrange and give Russ/Ish/Neto a nice assist.   Beal is shooting 46.6% from 10 to 16 feet and 44.5% from 16 feet to the 3pt line. That is better than league average from those distances, but it is still a low percentage shot because Beal is only scoring between 0.89 and 0.93 points per shot there. That is the same as shooting between 29.7% and 31.1% from 3pt. It's a big win for the defense when almost anyone shoots a mid-range shot, including Beal. The rare exceptions are players that consistently shoot around 50% from mid-range, such as Chris Paul and Kevin Durant.  For the first 5 seasons of his career, Beal was a 39.9% shooter from 3pt. Over the last 3 seasons, he has regressed to a 35.2% shooter from 3pt, which is unfortunately below league average (36.7%)"
Have you seen Chris paul play ever lol
"The one with Chris Paul, the whiny flopper"
Chris Paul school of acting
"Chris Paul and Harden out, Jimmy Butler in  And ONE of Booker or Mitchell depending how last games shake out (Performance + Standings + GP)"
Chris Paul the liliputian being used and abused on the inside by Taj.
Chris Paul too small
"Bro, they're abusing Chris Paul on defense..."
Chris Paul doing Ayton's job. Crazy.
Chris Paul is a problem.
"chris paul blocking shots at like 6'2, what a beast"
They're stupid if they don't lmao he's the future. I wouldn't expect Chris Paul to keep this level up after 2 years and thats assuming he even accepts his player option and resigns
"I appreciate Chris Paul and how he’s had a huge impact on the suns, but I don’t think you can put him over Mitchell, just feels disrespectful."
"&gt;No, that was his first year, and he was injured for most of the finals and he only even started half the games that year. And after that, the team was basically done anyways. Rodman only got good once isiahs career was winding down.   Oh my bad, it was his 1st of 2 lmao. That still proves he was a damn good player well before the end of Isiah's career lmao   &gt;Also, deandre jordan was literally first team all nba one of the years Chris Paul was there  Being a great lob threat while playing next to one of the best pick and roll players ever can do that for you.   &gt;Joe Dumars had never even been an all star until the end of the pistons main playoff run 1986ish to 1991. I think his first was 1990.   His first All Star was also the year he won FMVP lol  &gt; it’s also a joke Dennis rodman was dpoy coming off the bench most of the year. He was a pretty over rated defender. Dennis Rodman has way more name recognition than he should because he played for the bulls and he was a lunatic. That’s it.  Holy shit you're an idiot. This is definitely where the conversation ends lmao"
"Chris Paul was absolutely not considered better than Wade in 2009, and Wade made playoffs in both 2009 and 2010 with that bad team lmfao, as the 5th seed both times, he missed the playoffs in 2008 because he was injured most of the year.   In 2009, Wade won the scoring title, was 7th in assists per game, and 3rd in DPOY voting.   And ofc West was top 5 when he retired, only like 20% of the leagues history had passed up to that point compared to when Wade retired."
"No, that was his first year, and he was injured for most of the finals and he only even started half the games that year. And after that, the team was basically done anyways. Rodman only got good once isiahs career was winding down.   Also, deandre jordan was literally first team all nba one of the years Chris Paul was there and multiple times defensive first team I believe.   Joe Dumars had never even been an all star until the end of the pistons main playoff run 1986ish to 1991. I think his first was 1990.   You’re pretending that the pistons were some star studded team but they weren’t. They were a well built team but Isiah was the only star for most of his career. The clippers were easily more star studded. Sure, I don’t think deandre jordan should have been first team all defense, but it’s also a joke Dennis rodman was dpoy coming off the bench most of the year. He was a pretty over rated defender. Dennis Rodman has way more name recognition than he should because he played for the bulls and he was a lunatic. That’s it."
"TJ is *maybe* a starter level player in the NBA, but the only comp for him his prime Chris Paul and John Stockton"
"Well Isiah did win finals mvp, so I’d imagine so. It’s at least better than any finals performance by Chris Paul. He was busy blowing 3-1 leads to the rockets"
They couldn’t finish because *chris Paul didn’t fucking play*. At this point you just don’t want to admit it because it makes you look dumb
"How isn’t that true?   It isn’t a popular opinion ion here but ask people that watched him play tank him and they hold him in incredibly high regard.  He was a top 5 player at retirement, he was modernized the game more than almost anyone in the league.  And Chris Paul was considered better than Wade in 2009 too... not even getting that right. Wade was missing the playoffs and putting up monster stats on a bad team."
Surprised Kawhi and Chris Paul aren't on this
"Too high.  In the past year guys like  Wall, Westbrook, Chris Paul on super max have been moved at least once."
&gt;Suns were winning before CP3 got there  You talking about that 8 game winning streak they had in the bubble?? Because a team that finished 5 games under .500 doesn't sound like a winning team to me.  &gt;The lob city clippers were always gonna be decent with Blake Griffin and the other talent they had.  They went 32-50 the year before they added Chris Paul. He's literally the reason they had that nickname lol  &gt;he's been the beneficiary of some really good luck and great timing.  What luck?
"Really dude? Chris Paul is 7x all-NBA first team defender, 2x All-NBA 2nd team defender. Westbrook has 0 selections in either."
"1. Kevin Durant is obviously a beast and I have him as the 2nd best player in the NBA and Steph 3rd but KD a whole tier above Steph? Seems like a stretch considering Curry played very well those series as well and definetly would have deserved finals MVP both years if he would have gotten it. Remember Steph has won without KD but not the other way around 2. Again, AD has not accomplished anything on his own like the other 2. First off for Giannis, if you want to put one big shot over 2 MVPs and a DPOY then sure but im not going to  3. While Harden isn't the greatest playoff performer, he does get far more heat than he deserves. Russ played way worse than Harden in 2020 and it got so bad to the point that the Lakers would just leave him open so they could trap Harden. In 2019 it was more of the same story as Chris Paul looked washed due to injuries. The last time Harden really had significant help was 2018 and he delivered as he managed to go up 3-2 against the greatest team of all time before CP3 went out"
You forgot  Rajon Rondo- Chris Paul
Chris Paul is 100% not a better defender lol. I'll let ya'll (closely) put CP3 over Russ because he can shoot but goodness gracious. Lol.
Chris Paul
"If you want to look at advanced stats and plus/minus type numbers Westbrook has really fallen off the last 4 years. And if you just look at “winning” while ignoring everything else, Westbrook has been on otherwise solid teams that with him have barely crossed .500 and are easy first round exits for actual good teams. 2017 - 47 wins and lost in first round. 2018 - 48 wins and lost in first round with Paul George. 2019 - 49 wins and again had Paul George and again lost in first round. In 2020 OKC lost Westbrook and Paul George for Chris Paul and actually looked better than the previous season, actually pushing their first round to 7 games and not getting blown out in 5. And the team they barely lost to was Westbrook teaming up with Harden and the much more loaded Rockets. The Rockets meanwhile went from challenging the Durant/Curry Warriors with Chris Paul to barely squeezing past OKC and getting demolished by the Lakers.  And finally this year, the Wizards have a perfectly solid team without Westbrook, but even with their hot streak are 6 games below .500 and will either miss the playoffs or be an easy first round exit yet again. And in all of these playoff runs Westbrook’s teams have typically had a solid to great roster. But he does little to elevate them and sometimes hurts them. And his playoff performances in particular have been really brutal."
"CP3 had the 23rd most FGA, so he missed the cut.

Chris Paul doing his magic on the Knicks would be fun.
Chris Paul George Michael Jordan Horace Grant Hill
"Chris ""Paul ""Carmelo Anthony"" Clifton Anthony George"" Paul"
"Oubre put up counting stats but the Suns were worse off when he was on the court. On off numbers aren’t the end all be all but when all of the other top suns players he played along side of are are overwhelming large net positives (Booker, Ayton, Rubio, Bridges) and he’s the only negative that’s a sign in difference between the box score numbers and his actual impact. Hes been a net negative all but one season in his career, that’s even playing for playoff teams in Washington that overall had a positive differential. He’s just a massive more net negative this year compared to years past.   But let’s take the Suns players out of the equation. It’s not like the Suns are the first team Chris Paul has improved. Paul increased the suns offensive efficiency by 4 points. Even the Thunder were an average offensive team. The Knicks are a bottom 10 offense now, so even going from 20th to 15th would put the Knicks differential in line with the Sixers and the Nets. CP3 has made the suns go from 11th to 6th, which id argue is much harder to do. Add in the fact he’d be going up against more eastern conference teams on the Knicks I really don’t see why it’s that hard to see that going from the worst starting PG in the league to one of the best floor generals who has ever played wouldn’t add a bunch of wins."
Saw a vid wit ur son and chris paul and deuce didnt know how to throw up the deuces  How is this possible?
Chris Paul/Zeke for third team.
"He wasn't remotely close to Jokic's positive impact on the court.  He is already a better player than Murray was before his Acl however.  That isn't a knock on Murray - a switchable oversized wing with 95th percentile scoring efficiency is more valuable than any point guard other than Curry, Chris Paul and Damian Lillard.  Its just the way the position's work."
Why would Chris Paul leave Phx for NY?
"You can't just ignore the difference in conferences though.  If you want an easier path to the finals, you go to the eastern conference,  its been that way forever.   The Western conference playoffs is a blood bath, no one know that better han Chris Paul"
"I remember my dad seeing how pissed Chris Paul was during game 6 and predicted he'd get himself ejected. Sure enough, he cheap shots Gasol and gets ejected."
He is higher than Chris Paul and Steve Nash. What is this list?
"They talked about Lillard and CJ when they drafted Garland. Yeah, Lillard and CJ haven't won a ring, and we are not likely to either. But put the blazers in the East and they would have been in the mix for the finals every year. No backcourt duo you draft is going to likely be the core for a championship team, but they unarguably have hit on both picks imo. They're both undersized, but depending on how much one or both improve on defense it doesn't really matter. Chris Paul is undersized, but he's an absolute bitch to play against. Mitchell has also shown to be a good defender at that size. Sexton has shown he has that dog in him and IMO can become a plus defender one day."
"[This year and last year](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/paint-touch/?sort=PAINT_TOUCHES&amp;dir=1) Ayton has been top 2 in paint touches along with Clint Capela. Ricky Rubio made Pekovic a lot of money and gave Kevin Love his best statistical years, and Chris Paul is Chris Paul. If we can't get him involved more with them two don't know how much more we can get him involved. It seems like half of Bookers TO's are him trying to give Ayton the ball, I sometimes wish Booker just shoots the ball instead or passes it to another 3 point shooter rather than feed Ayton but that is mainly on Book. I wish Ayton was better dribbler and he was able to get the ball on the outside and was able to drive to the basket, creating for himself more."
"Do you think the last 2 or so years after the 2018 run would have played out better if the team wasn’t sold to Fertitta?  I know the Chris Paul-Harden marriage was probably not gonna end well either way, but the Russ trade didn’t seem like a typical Morey move"
I also think people just don't recognize how bad JJJ is at rebounding or how foul prone he is making him not great on defense. He got outrebounded by Chris Paul last year and as we know Chris Paul isn't necessarily Westbrook or Jason Kidd at getting reobunds. This is without even mentioning injury history.
"People assume he was inspired by Chris Paul finally making the Finals, but Duke players are more cosmopolitan. Insider sources say it was actually [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/ocmcn8/miraculous_healing_after_italy_scored_a_goal_today/)"
Steph has like at the very least four seasons better than any Chris Paul season. Also I doubt this Rockets fan is a Curry stan.
"I don’t really care for the audit, I actually haven’t even read it or would understand what it’s saying. But I watched that game live heartbroken and multiple times later with a clearer head and I watched the same thing I watched that night.  You saw the egregious fouls on us. Sure they had some no calls too. But those were typical no calls that went both ways, we’re not mentioning those too much. But you’ve seen the famous video, houston up 15, harden clearly fouled on a stepback (not even hard to see) and he missed badly leading to a quick transition 3 on the other end. That’s a 12 point lead compared to a 18 point lead going into half. That’s just brutal. Harden played an amazing game if we count these obvious fouls, since they didn’t he had just an *okay* game of 32/6/6/4 on 12-29 2-13 shooting, but that looks way better with the free throws. About 45~ points efficiently.  That’s besides the point, the point is they let golden state creep into the lead we had built with these 6 point swings over and over and during our cold streak hardens three is waved off and  houston is scared to even drive in. Already playing an insane defense down a man who’s going to score besides harden? And when harden is trying to score, he’s getting fouled. No calls. That’s why we lost. Yes did we go cold. Ariza went 0-12 with 0 points for crying out loud. The real reason we lost is Chris Paul, but strictly talking about what happened that night:  Houston lost by 9 points  Houston was obviously fouled on egregiously bad game changing fouls (let’s remember klay gets into easy foul trouble here) that are probably worth a fair amount more then 9 points   Yes we went cold, but we win that game anyways regardless of how many 3s we missed."
Chris Paul is famous for selling contact after the whistle.  That fall could easily be part of his routine.  CP3 is always ready to take a dive.  He did it just this game with the Cousins elbow.
"the clippers fortunes changed before they changed ownership also, lob city and the chris paul trade happened under donald sterling.  they had been getting to the playoffs and the 2nd round for a few years by the time sterling was forced out"
"Nobody who watches basketball thinks Chris paul is a better player than Steph Curry, you simply have to watch Curry in 16' and 21' and you'll understand."
"So what happened to AD in game 4 before he got hurt? Guy was brewing a stinker again, just like game 1, and we were winning when he went out. We were also the more injured team through that point, because Chris Paul was actually broken, he couldn't even dribble let alone shoot.  Obviously once AD went out the Lakers were at a significant disadvantage, but it's worth noting that we *crushed* them after that point. That's not indicative of a series that would be ""ridiculous"" to imagine the Suns winning.  I have no problem if you think the Lakers win, it would be a tough series. There's no evidence to suggest that the Suns would have no chance though."
Ingram and Rondo both swung on him.  So you're admitting you want to give Bev more games for pushing Chris Paul (5) than Ingram for trying to take his head off (4).  Glad we've concluded that you guys are just crybabies.
Do you consider Beverley running to push Chris Paul in the back to be worse than Brandon Ingram sprinting halfway down the court to swing at CP3 or are you just whining because it's Beverley?
"Brandon Ingram ran over to join the fight, swung on Chris Paul while he was being pulled away, and he got 4.  You guys want to give Bev 5 for a shove lol."
He literally flipped Chris paul while he was in the air a couple months ago
He's still over 65% from the field on his career in games without Chris Paul.
So it should be open season on Chris Paul?  How dumb.
Yeah but not every center had Chris Paul throwing perfect alley oops to them
Damn bro are you CP3 brother?  Go look at Chris Paul cheap shot videos. He's not a good guy like you think he is.
i hope atlanta wins the series for the sole purpose of Chris Paul winning a chip in state farm arena
"&gt;Come on dude, it's hard to win a single title. Ask Chris Paul or Nash or Harden or any of these dudes that haven't won one.   Sure but to the Lakers 1 title means a lot less than it would to Phoenix,Minny,Denver etc. Especially since you won a title so recently before this one."
"""only"" one championship?   Come on dude, it's hard to win a single title. Ask Chris Paul or Nash or Harden or any of these dudes that haven't won one.   Even one title is a big deal, and Davis was a bigger part of that one title than some of the Lakers that won multiple titles were to their teams."
Chris Paul was injured against the Lakers and  they still won game 1. If both teams were healthy the suns could have won the West anyway and the only team they got lucky to avoid was the Nets.
Suns with a severely injured Chris Paul were only -8 for the first 3 games of the series. The lakers outside of Lebron and AD were just not good
"&amp; LeBron wants to blame the short turnaround as if the players union wasn't part of negotiations.  The funnier part is, Chris Paul was that injured guy for a lot of the last 15 years and he's still going. Covid even bought his legs &amp; back some rest late in the playoffs.  He is the NBAPA president also, he should tell LeBron to shut the fuck up. LeBron is still paid like a king in the off-season. The rest of the players need to play."
Doc Rivers: pls give me Chris Paul or lillard
I meant that ayton and Booker will develop into mega stars and people will see a team with them and Chris Paul and think superteam
"Well currently he's moved Chris Paul up about 14 spots because of the playoff run while simultaneously discussing how the Bucks playoff success doesn't count because everyone they play is injured.   However he also keeps talking about how the Suns would have lost to a healthy Lakers team.   So in conclusion, my analysis of his analysis is: ???????????"
Chris Paul is about getting real money. This guy is about get rich quick schemes
Chris Paul taught Ayton how to get the bag
"1 week later: “POST GAME THREAD: Phoenix Suns defeat Atlanta Hawks 89-74 in 4 game sweep behind 14pts, 23Asts and 5 rebounds from Chris paul”"
for sure for sure.  This is the icing on the cake for Chris Paul too if he gets it.
"Not sure if this is completely accurate to the post but everytime a Suns player gets hit in the face this year they immediately cover their face with two hands and lay on their stomach. In the middle of the floor. Every. Single. Time. Every player the exact same way. I think it sells the refs to review the call pretty effectively. Never seen it prior to this year, just chalked it up to Chris Paul being sneaky with how flagrants are reviewed. How could you not call it excessive contact to the face if Cam Payne might be dying on the floor lol"
"Dude, were you hopped up on caffeine or some other upper when you wrote this?  Your post rubs as weirdly irritable and scatterbrained, considering the exchange started with me simply rebutting that Bron and AD are always injured, and that the Suns weren't nearly as banged up as the Lakers in the series... that somehow made you excited and angry?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;just because he doesnt put up the ppg doesnt make him bad  I didn't say he was?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Chris Paul did miss a game and play below strength, and they won.  That's pretty different from being below full strength for the entire series, that LeBron was.    &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Stop saying Bron wasnt 100, he had been back already.  (1) He came back from injury literally right before the Suns series.  (2) his initial high ankle injury was &lt;2 months below the playoffs, and he reaggravated it 2 weeks before the Suns series; his type of injury [normally takes 1.5-3 months to properly heal](https://www.google.com/search?q=average+time+out+for+high+ankle+sprain+nba&amp;oq=average+time+out+for+high+ankle+sprain+nba&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j33i160l2j33i299.6464j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8), and he just had weeks after the reaggravation. (3) [LeBron was specifically reported to not be full strength](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10004804-lebron-james-reportedly-was-85-healthy-from-ankle-injury-in-lakers-vs-suns-series) over the entire series.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;No one gave kyle lowry the benefit when he had broken bone chips in his elbow or when he went out with an ankle injury vs Brons Cavs  I don't remember this and I'm not interested enough to look it up, but any non-superficial fan should account for star player injuries in the playoffs.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;if your roster construction is devoted 2/3 to those players. And one egg breaks. Thats on you.  Lol, cite me the last two teams that won a championship without at least two max players on it.  LMK how far back you have to go.  And both eggs broke (LeBron partially).   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Dont have depth? Dont cry bout it.   (1) The Lakers DID have decent depth, considering their salary allocation; (2) no one's crying about anything, dumbass; injuries happen, and the Suns are a good team.  We won the chip last year; how's YOUR team doing?  If you were less dense, you would've noticed that I never said that the Lakers definitely win if full strength (maybe you confused me with the other poster).  Game-by-game ratings can't be done b/c Bron was partially injured every single game, as discussed, but sure, the Suns might've beat a full-strength Lakers squad anyway.  The Lakers went in only like -175 series favorites.  But what's still flawed about your suddenly-frantic Suns fandom arguments are that pro-oddsmakers had them with only the 4th best championship odds in the West at the outset of the playoffs (and they factor in injury chances).  They in fact would not be in the Finals right now without a sick run of luck of opponent injuries.  For instance, let's say we give them the benefit of the doubt that they squeak by the Lakers, and beat the Nuggets even with Jamal; they would've lost to the Clippers in 5-6 games, considering their close victories and that the Clippers were missing their best player the entire time.  And, going into next year, at minimum the Clippers and Lakers will get better championship odds."
"He's not fit to play in the NBA, his charade was exposed by Chris Paul, the Clippers lost the game because he cannot move and has trash attitude. He can only intimidate players with his attitude, he can barely walk."
So did Chris Paul...
I can’t believe people don’t even mention Chris Paul getting covid when bringing up how Suns only won cause of injuries. He couldn’t play with his team at all for 10 days. The Suns offense got worse when he came back. It seems like his rustiness was a result of covid. A lot of players performed poorly when they first came back from covid.  If he performs well in the finals this would prove my point.
"Chris Paul also got injured, did you miss he had 1 arm and was a liability for most of that series?"
"I think Shai Gilchrist-Alexander benefited a lot from having Chris Paul as a mentor. Also, Cam Payne, Devin Booker, and DeAndre Ayton."
"Chris Paul missed the same amount of games against the Clippers as Anthony Davis missed against the Suns. (2). Cam Payne stepped up and the Suns won those games. Weird, it’s almost as if having depth matters and the Suns weren’t going to let Chris Paul’s injury be the excuse for why they lost."
"200 and 250 more 3PT than your team or the famous Clippers is not something you can simply ignore with your claim.  “Their team scored more points than us but our accuracy was better and that means we should have won” is something that would probably come out of your mouth.  I can’t imaging beating the Clippers without Kawhi and then pinning it to my personality like a badge of honor. For your sanity, I really hope Chris Paul doesn’t blow it like he always does."
"&gt;How do you hate someone you don't even know in real life?  Lots of people hate Donald Trump or Joe Biden without actually knowing them in real life.   With regards to Chris Paul, I think he’s a whiny, flopping, bitch and his State Farm ads are fucking garbage. A ring would do wonders for his legacy, and I really don’t want to see that.  &gt; Booker looks like a douchebag? Lol  I’m not saying he’s one in real life, but are you really going to tell me that [this guy](https://cdn1-production-images-kly.akamaized.net/WJpSwsx4alJa9ZrT_pBjwqp0NY0=/640x360/smart/filters:quality(75):strip_icc():format(jpeg)/kly-media-production/medias/1757140/original/053375800_1509503041-booker.jpg) doesn’t look like an absolute tool?  &gt;The fact that he stayed in Phoenix after all these years just proves how big of an idiot you are.  How does that prove I’m an idiot? I never said he was disloyal. I just said that he looks like a douchebag"
Patrick Beverley to Paul George: “Watch this.”  *Pushes Chris Paul down from behind*  CP3: “What the heck are you doing!?”  PG: “That’s what I’m talkin’ about!”
"I’m not even a jazz fan, been a nets fan my whole life. Grew up playing nba live 2003 not even knowing what basketball was just because I liked to get on there and play as Jason Kidd. Been sold since then, long before I watched a single basketball game and haven’t pulled for any other team. I ain’t got nothing against Chris Paul and I do think if he wins a ring he’ll be right there or ahead of John Stockton. That’s nothing against cp3, he’s had a great career. But so did John Stockton and people tend to disregard that. Was never trying to argue man, I was just talking basketball. It’s all love in the end, I love having debates with basketball about people. It’s fun to talk basketball with somebody that also knows the game of basketball well, I’m just not going to sit and argue with somebody for having an opinion. And I didn’t mean to delete it, I’ve been sick and just accidentally clicked the wrong thing. Have a good day man, I’ll be looking forward to many other debates 🙏🏻"
"I said 4 first of all. In terms of prestige a FMVP is definitely similar to 4 All-Star appearances. Keep in mind if you win a FMVP your team also would win a championship too (only one exception with Jerry West but that won’t happen again).   Which means yes having a FMVP &gt; 3 All Star appearances IMO. Just ask Chris Paul this year if he would trade 3 of his All Star appearances for a FMVP. I guarantee you he would say yes. I guarantee you Giannis would say yes too. That’s because if you win FMVP, you also win a championship, and there are very few FMVPs in history (way less than 4 time All-Stars).   How about you do this thought experiment. Ben Simmons has 3 All-Star appearances. Say he hypothetically had 0, but this year the Sixers won a Championship and he was the FMVP. Do you think his NBA rank goes up or down? It would go way up, and the reaction to him here would be way more positive.  It’s quite clear almost any player - 3 All-Star appearances + FVMP &gt; that player with his current accolades. I can’t think of another player who would get worse in terms of their perceived ranking with 3 fewer All-Star appearances but with an FVMP (and championship). My point of the 4 All-Star appearances was to put the relative “prestige” of a FMVP so you can’t just solely look at All-Star appearances."
booker and ayton heard chris paul swearing and now they both do it :(
Chris Paul injured the whole NBA to get here
Chris Paul taught Ayton to care about attention to details  Source: Ayton
"&gt;oh now the suns are a scary 2 seed? you weren't acting like that going into the playoffs  We’ve gone through this. You can push your narrative all you want.  &gt;""12 deep"" implies you can handle an injury, which the lakers clearly couldn't  Oh we can handle an injury, just not to LeBron James and Anthony Davis...  &gt;so you're gonna go into the playoffs again next year with mister glass who can't get hurt or the season is over. have fun  Hypocritical as fuck considering you’re sucking the dick of a team led by Chris Paul..."
The CIA killed Chris Paul and replaced him with a body double back in 2015.
"Chris Paul is Zemo. I don't wanna root for him, but. I am."
"Ah yes, long time Milwuakee resident Jrue Holiday and Phoenix Suns veteran Chris Paul, built from the ground up"
So weird to see Chris be like a kid leaning on somebodys shoulder like that because I'm pretty sure he's one of the oldest players on the league but then I realize the league is crazy and he's just a few years older than me and I still feel like a big kid.   Sounds like just a genuine moment of happiness all around. Fuck Chris Paul for his antics kinda but as a fan of basketball it's great to see an all time great have the opportunity to cement their legacy.
"ok chris paul isnt nearly as good but his team was one of the best in the west and the suns had a historic leap from his arrival.   just because he doesnt put up the ppg doesnt make him bad   See: steve nash   Chris Paul did miss a game and play below strength, and they won. Not in 7. in Six. Stop saying Bron wasnt 100, he had been back already. No one gave kyle lowry the benefit when he had broken bone chips in his elbow or when he went out with an ankle injury vs Brons Cavs. Calling them trash bros. Well that Trash Bro, carried the Raps. So. Stop.   Home Court matters, even if AD was around its game 7 in Phx.   And finally, injuries do happen and often to athletic big men in the paint more so. And if your roster construction is devoted 2/3 to those players. And one egg breaks. Thats on you. The Suns existed with Cam Payne and next man up. Dont have depth? Dont cry bout it.   Suns won Game 1, teams healthy. Game 2 was a fucking Ref joke. Garbage time fts made it even. Suns won game 4 with AD leaving mid game, still suns were up 16 going into 4q.   So Game 5 No AD, suns stomped, they were at home.   Game 6, up 21 at half, 18/35 from 3. You arent beating that with AD.   Im not a Suns lifer, but take the L"
2018 Rockets beat Golden State if Chris Paul doesn’t go down
"No, I just think you’re the softest person I’ve seen on this site. To be this emotional and desperate three years after your team choked is kind of sad. I didn’t even care that much until you whined at me for 6 hours, now I’m invested enough to actually look into it and realize how unbelievably soft you actually are.   This game is a lot of G6 this year. Yeah the Warriors are better than the Clips, but the Rockets without Paul in 2018 were still better than the Suns. But when Phoenix faced officiating that favored the other team, they *made* their shots. Funny what a difference that makes, right? Even after they would lose “momentum” with some weak calls and the Clips would tie it up. That team basically played the whole game in the bonus and didn’t fold, but man the Rockets couldn’t fold fast enough.  My main takeaway from that random assortment of tweets that you think is some kind of gotcha is that they actually missed 25 straight shots. Holy shit, did Houston choke or what? “Buh buh buh MoMeNtUm”. Gtfoh these are professional athletes, they didn’t miss 25 straight shots because of “momentum”, they missed because they fucking shrunk from the moment. James Harden let a few missed calls and the refs ignoring his flopping get into his head and it was over from there. No wonder Chris Paul and he didn’t got along, what a weak bitch he must have been to let a few foul calls swing momentum like that. I’ve watched enough basketball to see “momentum altering” runs, the good teams always respond. Houston didn’t, because they outright choked. Blaming the refs is just to deflect, and it’s pathetic. And then to trot out that stupid ass video that shows like 3 egregious misses and a bunch of missed calls on Houston? Dude, lock it up.  Are you seriously still stuck on a weird “you hate Harden” train? I wish the Rockets had won, but they didn’t because they fucking choked. They weren’t wronged, you’re just a pansy, in the image of the 2018 Rockets."
Why would Kd be first after playing just 30 games in the regular season? Chris Paul would be at the top of this list. Paul George is easy top 10.
"I think you meant to title this, ""Will Suns Fans ever love Devin Booker as much as Chris Paul?"", no?"
"Lol what a bizarrely specific and harsh take.  There a ton of great basketball players to consider top 11, current and retired:  LeBron  Kareem  Magic  Shaq  Duncan  MJ  Steph  KD  Hakeem  Wilt  Bill Russell  Nash  KG  Harden  Giannis  Bird  Chris Paul  David Robinson  Kobe.  Obviously Kobe is better than some of these guys, but to act like it isn't close is kinda close-minded, which is where OP's question enters the scene."
"LMAO you think you’re some Internet tough guy or something😂   First of all, you keep bringing up the Suns as if they aren’t facing a 5th seed without it’s best player. They might have got a couple bad calls but they still won because they’re just the better team. A houston team missing CHRIS PAUL who you keep referring to has a 15 point lead on the KD fucking warriors, not Paul George and Marcus morris. That’s when the shit calls started. The lead shrunk because of that. Just say that first foul on bell is called properly. Harden hits free throws and the fast break 3 is taken, thats an 18 point lead instead of a 12 point lead. You’ve already fucking admit houston got the short end of the whistle, well I don’t need you to admit because the world already did   https://uproxx.com/dimemag/demarcus-cousins-warriors-rockets-game-7-referees-twitter-reaction/  No response that btw  So the team that lost by 9 without its second best player DEFINTLEY got the short end of the stick as you admit, and that’s not why they lost? Are you fucking kidding me? That lead is shrunken, idgaf how many shots we missed you don’t understand how momentum works in the NBA and the video clearly shows how egregiously bad and momentum swinging they were as illustrated by the commentators.  Sorry you can’t come to terms with those so you had to start a whole childish I can’t stand harden hiss fit, nobody gives a shit, houston was wronged in 2018 and you can’t do shit about it"
"We won the only game where CP3 and ad were both healthy, and we only got healthy Chris Paul for one half."
"I’m not changing my basketball opinion cause you’re mad that I have it. It’s basketball, there’s been debates about everything throughout the history of the game. My personal opinion, John Stockton was better. If you think Chris Paul is better then ok, that’s fine, that’s your opinion. Stop running chris pauls burner account getting mad at somebody for saying somebody else was better."
"&gt;Nobody said Malone wasn’t the driving force.  Actually everyone in the 90s said that and if you go back and watch full games and look at the stats, Malone was clearly the best player on the team. And look into the 1998 season if you don't believe me.  &gt; A good bit but it is very unlikely every single one went to Karl Malone.  Most did.  &gt;Karl Malone doesn’t have anything to do with the steal numbers either, that’s all personal effort on defense.  Oh yeah Stockton was a solid defender, CP3 is clearly he better one.  &gt;And Chris Paul lost in the playoffs literally every year as well, and has always been known for choking/blowing series leads/being injured  CP3 has choked like once or twice in his career. Overall, his stats go up in the playoffs while Stockton's go down. And Stockton has choked many times.  &gt;so that argument makes no sense.  Wtf are you talking about? I countered your point about Mj being the reason Stockton couldn't win.   &gt;Even in this playoffs the suns have a better offensive net rating with Chris Paul off the floor.   CP3 was injured in the first round and had Covid in the 3rd.  &gt;And I’m pretty sure John was the one that put the jazz up a point in game six of the 98 finals with some seconds left. Before JORDAN hit the shot to win it.  1 shots doesn't excuse Stockton from averaging less than 10 fucking points that series and having a 2 point game. He played garbage that series.  &gt;So yes, if there wasn’t a Michael Jordan in the world, the jazz would probably be 2 time champions in the league and John Stockton would have 2 rings.  We can play the ""what if"" game for every player of all time. And your what if  is the stupidest one ever. You can't just make a what if about someone not existing. A better one would be ""What if CP3 doesn't get injured against the warriors"" or ""what if Josh Smith become Michael Jordan against the clippers"" or ""What if David Stern doesn't veto the CP3 trade"".  &gt; I stand by my argument, if cp3 wins the chip we can talk, but if not John Stockton had the better career  Nope CP3 has had a better career even if he doesn't get the ring. He has better accomplishments, better advanced stats, much better peak, less help, played in a tougher conference, and was always the best player on his team(outside of the 2 years with the rockets)."
"The only bias here is you, friend. I definitely don’t like Harden, but I assure you I like Durant less. I hate that he won any championships at all in Golden State. They called the proper foul on Klay, and the wrong foul on KD. Harden tried to get cheap free throws instead of an inbounds, he was pretty renowned for it, glad to see him fail to do it on two separate foul calls, even though the second one should have been a screen foul on Houston.   You can’t act like your incredibly whiny routine here isn’t bias when a fan can list 7 free throws worth of uncalled infractions on Houston in that dumb video alone and you decide they don’t count because they weren’t hard enough fouls or whatever stupid reason it was.  But since you’ve finally annoyed me enough with the incessant whining, for the record, the Rockets didn’t “get fucked”, they choked. Nobody gets fucked when they miss 17 straight shots. The Suns had to battle the refs too and Chris Paul iced that shit anyway. If the Rockets could have hit a damn jumper, maybe they don’t lose by single digits. “Oh Buh buh when they did hit it they waved it off” and what? Professional athletes were too shook by that to hit a single jumper after? Did James Harden get a big sad that his usual shit wasn’t working and he just couldn’t go on? Man, there’s no excuses for them, they choked. Plain and simple. Missing 17 straight shots in a game you lose by single digits and you’re trying to blame the fucking refs? Jesus Christ. Refs wouldn’t have made a difference if professional basketball players hit 3 or 4 out of those 17 jumpers."
Bizarre to trivialize it all as “shooty hoops.” Fuck the guys who cry when they win championships. It’s just shooty hoops.   I expect you all to keep that same energy when Chris Paul or Giannis take their first rings very seriously.
1. Chris Paul  2. Cameron Payne  3. Jevon Carter
"Yea I don’t trust random people on reddit man lmao. I trust the game I see and genuinely thought rockets would have won if CP3 didn’t get hurt and am convinced rockets don’t go up 3-2 with out him. The only, only thing I remember was him not being a good 3 point shooter that playoffs but besides that he was a stud. Idk you’re trolling bc if you genuinely thought a future with Russell Westbrook looked brighter than Chris Paul you’re insane"
Pat Bev all post-season  *talks smack to everyone every play of every game*  Everyone  *ignores him*  Chris Paul  *Looks*  Pat Bev  *Freaks the hell out*
Go watch Chris Paul in the 2010-11 first round against the lakers.
"Maybe? If Ayton and Booker do become the major faces of the NBA like they are projected to be, then this team could be considered a super team. If anything, this team has a similar quality to the 2011-12 Thunder with young Durant, Harden and Westbrook, where the team will break out into stars that the league loves to advertise, but they aren't there yet. The major differences in this Suns team are that one of their stars is a 36 year old Chris Paul and Booker has been in the league for five years by now."
So happy for Chris Paul
Chris Paul - 2021 WCF Game 6
"I mean.. the man put it out there. I’m gonna react to it one way or the other. It’s not like he’s gonna call me on my personal cell phone and tell me he’s apologized to Chris Paul. Anyways, none of that changes the fact that you’re still a pussy."
"Also, I am always amazed how easily Chris Paul gets his little swiveling falling away pull up mid ranges to go no matter what the contest. Even if he has to double pump it and shoulder sling it, it still seems like it always goes in."
"Rookie of the year and also an all star his rookie year. Then essentially an all star every year he was on clippers, as well as making the playoffs every year. 3rd in MVP voting one of the years that Chris Paul missed a lot of time, which shows that he wasnt made or carried by Chris, like you’re insinuating. Then he gets traded to Detroit, and ends up having one of his best and most complete years, ending up all nba again and carrying Pistons to playoffs. Since then hes been derailed by injuries, and no longer the player he was. But foh saying he was just a high flyer. Dude was a legit baller in his prime."
"First off, I feel like I need to clarify overall that my initial point is that they both have intangible benefits attached to them to a level that you see few other players in their sport do.   I am not making a direct Tom and Chris comparison. Not sure  NOW, that being said, let's go:  \&gt; That's ignoring that the Suns in the bubble went 8-0 against their opponents,  Definitely not ignoring that?  \&gt; This team was already considered to be playoff contenders before adding Chris Paul  You're correct - they were like +4-5000 for the title (9th best in West) and had an o/u of 38.5 wins (7th in the west) before the season.   Those odds were *after they added* Chris Paul, though. So they were just kind of playoff contenders *after* adding him as well.  \&gt; it's not like he single handedly turned the franchise around.   I'm also not making that argument.  \&gt; Booker and Ayton were balling since the bubble started.  We were all there for the bubble, and I think people reacted appropriately given the Vegas odds above.  We're talking about being 1 game back of *having the best record in the entire league.*   Ayton has had a fucking incredible playoffs, which is great, but [he's redirecting it](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/06/27/ayton-on-chris-paul-he-was-the-best-thing-that-happened-to-my-career/) all to Chris, [who is hyping him up](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10006574-suns-chris-paul-on-deandre-ayton-contract-hes-gonna-get-him-a-bag-this-summer).   Him and Book are great young players that also [Facetime CP3 like he's their Dad](https://ftw.usatoday.com/lists/clippers-suns-devin-booker-deandre-ayton-facetime-chris-paul-after-game-1-win) after games.   My point with Chris is, is he worth what the Knicks are probably going to pay him on the court? Hell no.  But there are very, very few guys in the NBA who are to the point of where you can look at their value beyond just their on floor production and Chris is one of them.  Worth the money? I don't know. But it was a fun intellectual exercise.   \-----------------  I'm not comparing him directly to Tom. It sucks people think I am, and I have a full comment about him elsewhere that spurred the Chris point that I can't find right now, but whatever.   Really wish I could find the comment as it obviously generates some great discussion!"
"Are the sun's the only team without severe injuries this year during the playoffs timeline? Looks like Chris Paul was out for a few games due to covid protocols but he got back pretty quick and was wonderful in the last game.  Are players mostly wising up in 2021 and realizing playing through injuries, even if for a deep playoff run, is prolly bad for your career longevity? Or do we think the shortened season truly added alot more strain than normal?"
Cliff and Chris Paul are an iconic duo
That Chris Paul effect.
Who says he has to watch Chris Paul?
this is bullshit.   vegan doenst have the full amino acids the body needs.  basically chris paul is digesting himself.    plenty of athletes quit vegan or have gotten hurt with vegan diet.
Chris Paul is still playing.  He is certainly not ready.
Chris Paul opted out?
"&gt;He’s taking a team that just missed the bubble last year to the finals this year  I mean right here in your other reply, you say that he's taking a team that missed the bubble to the Finals.   That's ignoring that the Suns in the bubble went 8-0 against their opponents, they just didn't control their destiny. This team was already considered to be playoff contenders before adding Chris Paul. Yes, he elevated them, but it's not like he single handedly turned the franchise around. Booker and Ayton were balling since the bubble started.   Brady came in and took a team that had no hopes of playoffs the year prior and made them Super Bowl Champions. His impact, IMO, is just so much more apparent to turning around a franchise than CP3 being just a good addition to a good team."
Chris Paul fits best on teams with young players open to being coached.  Get him back to New Orleans lol.  It ends where it begins. (although technically it began in OKC for CP3)
"Chris Paul would've flopped if an opponent tried to give him a high five, lol"
"Note: This one kinda got away from me lol. Not tryna rant at you in particular.  I understand the argument for ""diluted"" and get why people think just anyone can get in, I just disagree vehemently. I'd rather a few edge cases squeak by than actual deserving players not get in.   I absolutely hate the way Baseball and Football do it. I'm not as well versed on either, as NBA is by far my favorite, but I still don't like what I see.   MLB just feels snobbish about the whole ""first ballot v third ballot"" and ""doesn't deserve to be unanimous"" kinda bullshit gatekeeping. Its fine if you gotta talk yourself into a guy getting in, but any system where voting against surefire dudes like Ken Griffey Jr for any reason is fucking bullshit.  And I absolutely loath how the NFL just doesn't give a shit about certain positions, an entire phase of the game (special teams), and certain franchises. Its is fucking absurd that a Kicker has to be the GOAT to get considered past the 60s. Fuck punters entirely despite them being essential to every team. Its absurd that the Bengals only have one Hall of Famer, Anthony Munoz, and he had to be the literal GOAT at his position to be considered. The sports been around for over 100 years and over 26,000 players have played, but there's like 300 guys in total (not counting coaches and such)? Only 300 guys have been great? That's about 1.1% of players. Nevermind the sport is so punishing that careers are constantly cut short by the nature of the game, supreme edge cases like Terrell Davis or Calvin Murphy for insane peaks, but most guys don't. Start out great and some guy comes down hard on your knee one day? Sucks to suck, bro. You just weren't that good. And I think its just gotten harder and harder over time because people put these guys on pedestals and don't like that other guys are maybe as good as their childhood heroes so the bar has to get raised just a little bit more for each generation and I feel like that's malarkey.   Conversely, the NBA has been around for 75 years, about like 4.5k players have suited up and like 200 guys are in the Hall. That's like 4.4% are in. So yeah 4x the rate of the NFL, but its not like that much higher. I like that Basketball celebrates guys who were great in their time. If Joe Johnson is ""diluting"" the esteem of the Basketball Hall, then I'd like to know how other sports aren't. What even constitutes ""dilution""?  Does YA Tittle being in the NFL hall take away from Johnny Unitas? Johnny U has 12k more passing yards and 80 more touchdowns, 4 more probowls and 2 more All NFL nods with just one more year played. Same era, contemporaries for a time, does that constitute dilution? Where's Len Dawson fit into this? How many people that talk about Joe Namath know about Sonny Jurgenson? Calvin Johnson played 9 seasons, had 11,619 yards, 83 TDs, and 731 Receptions. Art Monk played 16 seasons, had 12,721 yards, 68 TDs, and 940 receptions. Randy Moss played 14 seasons, had 15,292 yards, 156 TDs, and 982 receptions. One of them sticks out pretty from the others, does that mean the others don't deserve it? Would adding Chad Johnson who played 11 seasons, had 11,059 yards, 67 TDs, and 766 receptions really stand out as an outlier? Its fine if so, but where's the line? Ocho had about as much yards as Calvin with only a little extra games played and certainly less consistent QB play. He's got the same amount of TDs as Monk in significantly less games played. I think most people agree Chad isn't quite Hall worthy, but his stats aren't particularly out of whack from other guys that are in. Lynn Swann played 9 seasons, had 5,462 yards, 51 TDs, and 336 receptions, basically half of Chad's stats, but he was on a Dynasty team so he's in. Would him getting in really throw things out of whack that bad? Is that diluted?  Is Joe Johnson really watering things down that bad? 7 all stars, 20k points with another 5k rebounds and assists? There's few guys that hit that mark and didn't make the hall and plenty more who didn't hit 20k and are in. Only 50 players have done it so far (including ABA stats, 46 if you exclude). Chris Paul will be next if he plays next year, 22 points to go. The only ones who aren't in the Hall are guaranteed guys that are still going or recently retired and are surefire. The only two who hit that mark and aren't in the hall Tom Chambers (4x all star and people debate on him getting in) and Antawn Jamison (2x All Star, Hall of Very good). Lamarcus Aldridge was 50 short, he's another 7x All Star that will likely be in. Is Joe Johnson really muddying any waters here? 7x All Stars really isn't easy to do either.  There are certainly tiers of greatness and those tiers are generally understood by how well these names live in memory. Some will go by the wayside, but that doesn't mean they weren't something in their day or undeserving. Joe Johnson will probably be one of the names that doesn't immediately jump to mind down the line, but he was a baller in his day."
"Yeah his weaknesses amplify each other. Like if you are going to spend tons of time in the mid range game to really maximize it as a strength you have to be a good playmaker. Utilize that area of the court as real estate to set up guys. When you enter mid range your first thought should be, ""Can I from this part of the court set someone up for a layup or wide open 3"" and if thats not there then you can think about taking a pull up. It's how someone like Chris Paul operates. CJ though that's not his game so it makes him less threatening and makes the mid range less valuable. Like Luka Doncic when he enters the 5-10 ft floater range is thinking ""Let me see if I can throw a lob first"" and plan B is to take the floater if it's not there. CJ is too limited in that regard.   Bottom line is you need to be doing something from that area of the court to be stressing defenses. Even if you arent amazing playmaker, if you are a good mid range shooter and good finisher at the rim who can get by his guy fast that works also you are bending/affecting the defense in a certain way that opens things up for others. CJ you just dont get any of that."
Except he doesn’t constantly go around pushing people from behind... Also it’s not avoiding backlash in any way. Everyone wants to be mad and wouldn’t stop even if he called Chris Paul on camera in tears. Let’s not pretend like anyone here would be saying anything different if it did say “I’m sorry and I was wrong.” They’d just change the wording of their “outrage.”
"I literally just said he deserves 15 games, buddy. I'm just also making the point that Paul has a history of players losing it with him and also a history of people not liking him so it comes with he territory of being that guy. I'm almost positive it's partly why Chris does the stuff he does, to try and make players lose their cool."
"Like I said, Nets were very likely if at full strength, no argument there.   Lakers had to beat some combination of Suns, Jazz, and Clippers, so I wouldn't say that's a sure thing even if you argue they're definitely better than all three. Suns also had an injury to Chris Paul keeping that series close."
Who knew the casual fan liked watching Steph Curry more than Paul George/Chris Paul?!?
"Yeah, I think it's part a lack of habit - growing up overweight and as a perimeter player he's probably never chased a block in his life, but I also think it's scheme based in order to get him to avoid foul trouble cause of how valuable he is on offence.  I've also seen stats which state that while teams shoot a very high percentage at the rim against Jokic, they don't take many attempts in the paint, so it seems they scheme to stop teams getting there in the first place. Which works until you come up against Chris Paul, who is better from the midrange in an NBA playoff game than I am in a lay up line."
"Nobody gets paid what they are worth.  Lebron and Kawhi and some others are worth more than the max.  Having caps helps them distribute the money more evenly, what the players union wants.  Lebron is underpaid and Kennard is waaaaaay overpaid.   The fact is someone may offer the max and the good Gms know when to keep and not to.    Like I would be shocked if the suns don’t max Chris Paul. Because you have at least 2 more healthy years with load management to be a contender."
"BTW, Game Changer, the movie Chris Paul helped make, can be streamed on Netflix. It is worth watching."
"Yeah, they taste similar to the real thing. I find mushroom burgers and nut burgers are much yummier and definitely healthier than beef burgers. In general, vegan food that tries to imitate meat never tastes good to me. It is amazing how many great vegan foods there are, but it work to find in restaurants or make yourself, unless you are a millionaire like Chris Paul and you can afford a personal chef."
To that point it's widely believed that Tilman Fertitta was the one applying pressure for Chris Paul to be traded ASAP and I'm inclined to believe that because Tilman Fertitta is a fucking moron who is way too involved in that front office. I don't think you can squarely blame Morey for that trade.
If Chris Paul wins a chip and Fmvp then he is already an all time better player than Kevin Durant
None of those 3 were as skilled as Chris Paul when it comes to pure shot creation and couldn’t someone make the argument that a player in this era who made the first team All-Defense seven times would be even better in Stockton’s era?
"Chris Paul was never advocating against vaccines, so...."
"you’re right they should also introduce chris paul as chris paul every time. and tell us he’s an nba player too. there should be a disclaimer before the add starts that says “this ad will feature chris paul. Christopher Emmanuel Paul (born May 6, 1985),[3] nicknamed ""CP3"", is an American professional basketball player for the Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Playing the point guard position, he has won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, an NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award, two Olympic gold medals, and led the NBA in assists four times and steals a record six times. He has also been selected to eleven NBA All-Star teams, ten All-NBA teams, and nine NBA All-Defensive teams.” they should do this for every athlete in a commercial because what if I don’t know who they are? now i’ll know."
"His assists did fall in the regular season without those three guys, and of course the role players struggled more in the postseason. Even MPJ who couldn't miss in the regular season struggled being a number 2 in the postseason.  But you're right that he was looking to score a lot more, putting up an efficient 30 points per night. But I wouldn't use that as an example of his playmaking anymore than I would when Chris Paul averaged 5 assists for multiple postseasons in a row or when Lebron averaged under 6 assists in his first championship run in Miami"
"Chris Paul, Marcus smart, any others?"
My brain had to decide whether you were making a joke about nba players  /fans hating Chris Paul for a second or if you were alluding to children
Cause Chris Paul is a bitch ass flopper. Also fuck Jae crowder
Ah I see you got deceived by the Chris Paul effect.
He’s trying to psych out Chris Paul cause he hates him so much
This kills the Chris Paul.
"Kawhi wasn't the only star player the Suns avoided though. I'll be curious to see how the Suns hold up next season, given the age of Chris Paul, the fact that Booker is playing in the Olympics, that this will be Crowder's second straight short off-season, and of course because Saric will miss next season as well (plus Cam Payne may leave in free agency, just like Reggie Jackson). Everyone in these Finals will have less than 70 days in between the last game and when training camps open. That's almost exactly the same amount the Nuggets and Celtics got last off-season, just for comparison's sake."
"Garnett was drafted in 95 thou, Kobe 96, Duncan 97, and dirk was 98. Dwade was a clear miss, Melo for sure makes it, and I think Anthony Davis is there too. I'll throw in Chris Bosh for consideration along with D rose, Westbrook, Kevin Love, Andrew Bynum, Demarcus Cousins, Paul George,  Lillard, Draymond, Klay. I know Pau Gasol started in '02 but he should be on  In a few years switch in Luka, Embiid, and Jokic"
“I’m Chris Paul”
"„Hello police? Come quick Scott Foster trying to beat me up!“ - Chris Paul, probably"
Is this a serious reply?   You guys have fucking Chris Paul and Jae Crowder on your team. That's reason enough.   Any likeable players or cool storylines about your team are cancelled out by those two shitheads with their whining and dirty play.
1 Sabonis   2 Lillard   3 Chris Paul   4 Jamal Murray   5 Bradley Beal   6 Jimmy Butler   7 Tyler Herro   8 Cameron Payne   9 Rudy Gobert    10 Julius Randle
"Lowry. I know I’ll get downvoted to hell because Raptors fans, but dude would still be the laughing stock of the league if not for Mr. Leonard. People on this sub act like he’s Chris Paul"
Fuck Chris Paul. He is a smart player that knows exactly how to run into people and try to injure them. Plus always trying to stand under people landing
Chris Paul doesn’t say Gee
"LeBron wasn't close to healthy in that game either though. Remember, he was on a minutes restriction in the play in game against the Warriors, which was literally the game before that one. With both of those players being limited that's still a win for Phoenix as LeBron is much more important to what the Lakers do than Chris Paul is for the Suns."
Chris Paul and Blake Griffin are both are built like Mr. Glass from Unbreakable.
"I mean, they won game 1 when Chris Paul got hurt and played with one arm while we were “relatively” healthy. I don’t know why people play these what if games when it can be used in so many ways."
"Chris Paul will be in the hall of fame, most likely a first ballot. Are you daft?"
This is a classic straw man. Let’s present an argument that no one is making so I can try to be right. I promise you multiple players can be injured at the same time and it can impact their teams.   And obviously I never said anything about it being “even.” Chris Paul was significantly hampered and that is all I said. You don’t have to pretend Chris Paul wasn’t hurt to know AD was also seriously injured.
Both Laker stars were hurt the whole series and Chris Paul got healthy.
I know it's bait but damn you're chillin in Cancun and Chris Paul is on your mind? seek help
nothing one little shove won't take care of   \-chris paul
"Nah I'm not gonna downvote it. I don't necessarily agree cause I think that Clippers team was super weird and sometimes didn't show. That's not to say the bucks would beat them (not really the point of this convo). I still can't figure the bucks out either.   Anyway - I just disagree on Luka top 5. I'd like to see one playoff series win before you get that?   Guys who can't win the finals after years in the league get tossed aside: Giannis before this year, harden, Chris paul, etc   Young guys can have zero success at all and get a pass.   Take Giannis out of it cause apparently my handle biases me - I couldn't imagine a scenario you'd put Luka over KD, Lebron, Curry, Harden, and Kawhi. Top 5 is a smallllll group."
"I mean - the first Steph Curry Warriors championship was paved with a lot of injuries.   Obviously KLove and Kyrie in the finals. Thunder didn’t make the playoffs because KD only played 20ish games and Westbrook broke his hand. Chris Paul was hurt so the clippers were down. Rockets were down Bc Beverly and Montejunas (who was solid for them) were hurt. Memphis had Conley injured. Portland had Aldridge down and a host of others Including Batum.  No one discredits that warriors championship today - at the time many did. I think, if the suns win, history will look back on this post season and say they played who they had to play and at the end of the day got the job done. Period."
Don’t underestimate the ability of Pelicans to screw things up. We had Chris Paul—we did not build a team around him. Same thing with Anthony Davis. Same thing with Zion. We traded Jrue Holiday to the Bucks in some wacky deal also involving the Thunder.
Tbf Chris Paul isn’t doing y’all any favors
"Chris Paul: ""AW SONUVABITCH!!!!!!!"""
Even if Jrue is missing shots he’s still been locking Chris Paul down.  You sound like a Suns fan who is mad our team is making highlight plays.
"&gt;Scott Foster literally taunted CP3 after one of the times CP3 lost with him reffing.  All Foster did was point out he also officiated another Game 7 Chris Paul was involved in, and that was before the game. Unless he made controversial calls against the Paul's team, I think it's fair to assume that he was just pointing out a coincidence."
"lebron, kobe, duncan, garnett, dirk  durant, curry, harden, kawhi, howard  Chris paul, giannis  last spot may be westbrook, lillard, Carmelo or other people"
Chris Paul is headed to NO. He and Willie Green have been on the same team for most of CP3s career.
"Chris Paul DID have a solid but not great game 5, regardless of the stats"
"Giannis was affected, he missed two games. He took time off to get healthy, Chris Paul did not. Doesn't seem like a very good comparison"
"just caught a shiny Feebas. I'm running with this guy for 20 kms  In related news, Chris Paul in shambles"
"You mean the Chris Paul who shoved Giannis in mid air? Which is exactly what I was complaining about? Which is exactly what I said here was a dirty play?  Where exactly is the ""gotcha"" you think you have?"
I don't like Chris Paul but he literally couldn't dribble with one hand or shoot threes due to the stinger. He shot 74% from the foul line when he's been 91% for the rest of the playoffs. It clearly affected him.
"Nah bro, stop making excuses. Chris Paul sucks am I right???  It is very common for him to sit the final 7 minutes of a game the Suns were leading with 5 minutes left. Totally minor injury."
I watched Jrue Holiday play full court press on Chris Paul as well. That shit tires you out. If you don't play basketball just say so.
"I wonder how people on this flip-flopping pancake of a subreddit are gonna react to Giannis if the Bucks drop Game 6 tomorrow lmfao.  ""Chris Paul is one of the hardest working players in the game, Giannis is a perpetual choker!"""
I think we’re being a lil tough on the suns I mean no one was saying this a week ago when they were spanking the bucks in the first 2 games and did we forget chris paul was basically Jeff Teague in that lakers series dude couldn’t even dribble
Chris Paul will wipe the floor with good ol Scottie
"I mean take Chris Paul, Booker or Ayton out of their team and they might not even make the playoffs. Depth is overrated. Bucks and Suns are basically playing a 7-8man rotation."
"50th highest True Shooting % in NBA history. Guys ahead of him are LeBron, Chris Paul, Harden, Durant, Curry, Jordan, Jokic, Barkley etc. He’s in that crop of players.  He’d be fine, probably better growing up in a era that teaches players to shoot more."
Says the guy crying about Chris Paul.   https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/omm74h/if_the_bucks_win_this_series_this_would_be_the/h5m34nl/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3   https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/omot2e/curious_to_the_decisionmaking_of_chris_paul_to/h5mejlm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3   https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/omkeba/chris_paul_36yearsold_is_averaging_2139_in_the/h5lnxrr/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3
"Yeah, he had a minor injury that he played through, like damn near everyone in the playoffs does. Taking a minor injury and elevating it to ""Chris Paul was broken"" is troll as fuck. Everyone works through shit, a minor injury doesn't come close to explaining away his performance."
"I'm a (Raptors) homer and don't think Lowry is as good as Chris Paul, but you're not doing Kyle justice comparing him to Fred.   One of Kyle's go-to moves is to dribble along the baseline and try to make a play from under the basket. His handle is tight enough that he can operate in a crowd and find his slasher (e.g. Boucher). Fred does exactly what you're describing though. He has low efficiency at the rim and tends not to facilitate from the paint.   It's interesting to consider which parts of Kyle's game are better than Chris's though.  He's a more versatile defender since he's quite a bit stronger (+20lbs) and defends much larger players.  The uniqueness of his charge-drawing also allows him to protect the paint against bigger players.  I think his other main advantage is that Lowry plays a strong transition game. He inbounds as quickly as he can, he runs, has his QB passes, and does his pull-up transition 3s. Chris Paul walks the ball up on almost every single play."
"Chris Paul was broken. If we're going to talk about how the Suns wouldn't be here because of injuries, let's at least acknowledge that."
Scott Foster’s real crime is making me feel sympathy for Chris Paul in a basketball game
Chris Paul has had one bad game this series
Scott foster is a good ref. The reason Chris Paul don’t like him is cause foster doesn’t reward his bs
"It isn't really an advantage any franchise has.  The Lakers struggled to sign free agents towards the end of Kobe. The Clippers have signed one elite free agent of note, 2 if you want to count Chris Paul after trading for him. This myth about LA having some huge advantage is totally unfounded."
Looking forward to the Chris Paul meltdown tomorrow
"You don't have to like it but to say that there is ""absolutely 0 strategy"" and that 70s and 80s teams would ""demolish"" modern-day teams is your opinion - one that most likely will remain unquantifiable. But it really shows that you A) don't appreciate basketball and, B) miss ""the good ol' days of basketball."" I, like you, grew up watching 80s basketball and frankly even the Lakers and Celtics don't live up to the hype of their legendary conflicts - they played some really bad games every now and then. Don't get me started on how bad most of the 80s teams were. Bad games are part of any sport where you have to huck a rubber ball through a metal ring with other people trying to stop you.  I like professional wrestling and I'm familiar with modern-day performers, their schticks, and the type of wrestling that is popular today. Most pro-wrestling in the U.S. and Mexico is not my bag - so I choose not to watch it. However, I have taken the time to try and understand the modern-day version of pro-wrestling and after a sufficient period of time, decided it isn't my cup of sizzle.   I'd encourage you and your dad to give it another try but with an open mind. The Bucks haven't won a championship since 1971. The Suns have never won a championship. Chris Paul is probably a top 2 or 3 point guard all-time with one of the finest basketball minds I've ever seen. Deandre Ayton has literally improved before our eyes this season. And Giannis Antetokounmpo is a man with an amazing personal story of overcoming hardship, devoting himself to learning the game, and rather than chase a winning situation somewhere else last offseason, signed with the team that drafted him and is now one game from winning an NBA championship. I'll take this over most of what I saw in the 80s and 90s."
"Is it possible that because he is such a smart player he comes out much better than the other team because he’s good at adjusting to new situations and solving problems, but then throughout the series his physical limitations catch up to him as teams figure him out and the best strategy for each team becomes more obvious? Can someone smarter than me or who has watched chris paul more closely than me confirm or deny this theory?"
"That’s impossible to say. If they still get Chris Paul, then sure, but if Luka means no Ayton and CP goes somewhere else then no."
F. Chris Paul
"This one hurts. At times like these, most people don't consider the ramifications of a NBA like Chris Paul ending his career without a championship. My family owns and operates a home design store in Phoenix and we have been lucky enough to develop a relationship with Chris. He always says, ""we have the best bathrooms in the city,"" and frequently stops by after practice. He is so gracious to my family and fellow customers, we never have the heart to tell him he is using a showroom bathroom. My grandma always gives him a warm smile as he leaves, before changing into her CP3 jersey to handpick his turds out of the toilet."
"We need that meme with the guy sweating at two buttons. ""Ref to force a game 7"" is one button, and the other button is ""Ref to screw over Chris Paul""."
"Bill Simmons has the worst decency bias of all. And he seems aware of it sometimes. 2-0 he started talking about moving Chris Paul up his all time list. And can we talk about him as greatest PG ever. And I’m thinking, wait, cause he beat the injured lakers, nuggets, clips and now this bucks team?? And now what,,, what will Bill say if suns lose? CP plummets back to what we thought he was? I don’t understand his analysts overreact so badly. It goes with the territory but jeeeezus"
"His heart says “fuck Chris Paul”, but his brain says “game 7”. This will be an internal battle."
"I’m not sure you understand what happens when a stars rookie contract ends. I’ll  make this as simple as possible.    Rookie deal = cheap. Best time to sign vets and talent to try and win.   Rookie deal ends and star signs max = cap space is scarce and much harder to build and win.    Spending the rookie deal years of a generational talent for mid first and waiting out awful contracts you didn’t even need to sign = Bad. Player gets mad and leaves or demands trade.    You literally just watched this happen with Chris Paul, then Ad. Is it going to be third times the charm before the pels learn their lesson?"
"they been around for just over a decade. missed the playoffs like 3 times?  been to a finals, been to 4 WCFs, were a serious contender for half the decade. Had Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony and more play for them. Now they have promising young talent in Shai and a huge number of assets to work with. yeah they never won, but compared to other newer teams they’ve been spoiled."
"&gt;Chris Paul averaged 15 on 56% TS so no it wouldn't  Such a misleading way to present a guy who’s a far superior defender and 100 times the passer Middleton is. Especially when that said guy played next to someone with the 2nd highest USG% since 1978 (no data prior).  56 TS%. “All-star” Middleton averaged 18.3 ppg on 55.8 TS% with half the assists, much worse defense and the same turnovers. Imagine comparing Chris Paul to Middleton lol"
There was a pretty good discussion about Chris Paul and “basketball reasons” going on last week and one of the mods deleted because it “has nothing to do with the NBA”
Chris Paul averaged 15 on 56% TS so no it wouldn't  I am taking any Middleton season after 2017 above that when you also factor in availability
"Yeah, sad that Chris Paul, Capela, Tucker, Gordon and the rest of the roster all died in the opening night and Harden had to play 1 against 5 the rest of the season.  Funny how Chris Paul’s “terrible” season would be Middleton’s 2nd best season by a mile lmao"
"They have similar games. Both floor generals who are solid 2-way players. CP3 ain’t all defense anymore and Lowry’s a good defender.  Chris Paul **is better overall** right now. Nobody is disputing that. They are however, very close. Paul shoots more midrange while Lowry shoots more 3s. They have the exact same 3p% but Lowry takes twice as many. Nearly shoot the exact same total # of shots per game. Paul is 1% better eFG%.  Not to mention this was a down year for Lowry and a resurgence for Paul."
"What about JR Smith? Game 1 of the 2018 finals?  Edit: Deandre Jordan had a similar incident against the Blazers. He rebounded the ball as the shot clock went off, which he took for the game clock. So he just held the ball as time expired and Chris Paul furiously screamed at him to shoot it lol"
"The suns this year are just the more interesting team for the national stage.  The bucks have been competing for a chip for at least 3 years, the suns came out of nowhere.  The most exciting player on the bucks is Giannis who we have had our fill of over the past several years.  The most exciting player on the suns is Booker who has been hidden away on bad teams for a long time so he is new and shiny for most fans.  Chris Paul getting his first ring at age 36 is a better story than anyone on the Bucks getting their first ring.  Also the Bucks have a good shot at getting back here over the next few years.  The suns right now are very dependent on a 36 year old point guard, so this may be their only shot in this window."
Your delusional and biased.  He put up better numbers shooting more efficiently from the free throw line 3 point range as well. With a old chris paul. Kobe even said Booker was next but u keep hating. Kobe didnt even win finals mvp and mvp until shaq left. Kobe was number 2
"Which fits in with the Clippers curse. If you think that's just relegated to only affecting Chris Paul, [you need to look at their history](http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/090624&amp;sportCat=nba) and everyone else associated with them. Look at the injury issues Blake Griffin has had, which all started for him literally in his first pre-season with the Clippers and have continued after they traded him. Look at what Kawhi is dealing with right now. Look at how often Patrick Beverley gets hurt, how he missed a full season injured as a Clipper. Look at Serge Ibaka out with back injuries all year and now may miss all of next season with back surgery. Look at Zubac fucking up his knee. Look at Paul George's shoulder issues and his persistent hamstring problems. That shit is real."
What's unprofessional about it other than it hurting Suns fans' feelings?  Is Chris Paul not on the verge of becoming the first player to lose four 0-2 series?  Did they sneak into his bedroom and record him watching footage of the other 3 without informing him?
Chris Paul wasn't on the team in 2015 and 2017 and he was hurt in 2019. Even when he was healthy he was pretty bad in 2019  Also I meant 2019 and 2020 in which Giannis was a superstar since Middleton was an all star  Also ur just helping my argument lmao just listing more help for Giannis
"&gt;Yea he's been an all star in the 2 seasons that Giannis has been a superstar  2 seasons as a superstar yet he won B2B MVPs before this season. Definition of a clown take.  &gt;Still better than anyone Harden had  Chris Paul&gt;&gt;&gt;Middleton. Bud was forced to change his scheme in his first season as Middleton was mightily struggling with the “3s and layups” philosophy, spending the whole December shooting under 40%. But he got voted as an all-star, because apparently you have to have 2 all-stars if you have the best record.  You could easily make the case, supported by stats, that Middleton was the Bucks’ least valuable regular season starter in Bud’ 1st year, Bledsoe, Lopez, Brogdon and Giannis all flourished immediately.  Bledsoe was actually the Bucks’ 2nd best regular season player in those 2 seasons, 2-way stud, borderline all-star. And the main reason playoff Bucks looked much worse as he fell off a cliff as soon as the postseason started."
"Did people really forget game 1 of this series when Chris Paul went to the bench and the trainers surrounded him with towels and then Malika asked him after the game about the injury and he said ""I have no idea what you're talking about"". The dude fucked up his wrist and that's on top of the finger/ligament injury suffered in the other series. Like you said, a top 5 all time point guard doesn't just forget how to dribble a basketball because Jrue Holiday is guarding him lol"
"I’d say Chris Paul, but it would be really weird since the ownership isn’t even the same. Idk I don’t think I’d give anyone a statue tbh"
"Maybe the Clippers aren't the cursed ones, Chris Paul is."
How angry are you for Chris Paul right now?
&gt;Kobe has as many MVP's as Drexler has first team all nba selections.  &gt;And he has as many finals MVP'S as Drexler has second team selections.  And?  Nash has more MVPs than Chris Paul. Is he a better player?  Also I never said Drexler was better than Kobe so wtf are you crying about?  I don't hate kobe at all. But you're clearly another teenage dick rider who wasn't even alive to watch the dude play. Or you're just a kobe Stan.  Sorry kid. This convo is over. You don't have to like my list. Scroll on.
"There it is, [the new hollinger article](https://theathletic.com/2713807/2021/07/19/2021-nba-free-agency-point-guard-rankings-by-bord-chris-paul-kyle-lowry-top-a-deep-field/) values Schroder as $11.3m and predicts him to get a $35m/3 or a one year deal to reset his value."
Chris Paul has body issues?
"Chris Paul has had better PnR numbers for 6 straight seasons, higher PPP and almost double the frequency. I can't take anything seriously if you're going to tell me ""they're about the same"" in the PnR lol."
Chris Paul chokes a lot. My definition is when a player can't even do routine actions in critical moments. Paul fits that definition like a glove. The number of terrible passes and sloppy ball control late in games has been absurd.  That said I still think he's an incredible competitor in big games. But he absolutely has instances of major chokeage.
"Doesn't matter.  I actually don't think it was an intentionally dirty play by CP3, but that doesn't matter either because these kinds of fouls can lead to injury even if not intended.    What Chris Paul did was not a basketball play and it should be a flagrant foul.  A Flagrant 1 is ""unnecessary contact committed by a player against an opponent"".  Nothing about ""excessive"", which is a flagrant 2.    A foul that had zero intention of making a defensive play and was at or below the waist is clearly ""unnecessary contact"".   Whether it is excessive is in the eye of the beholder.    Basically, like the clear path fouls, the NBA intends to take kinds of fouls out of the game.  And that means it needs to be more advantageous for Paul to just let Giannis dunk it than to foul him in this manner.  That is done by giving the other team two shots and the ball."
Chris Paul is both an incredible competitor in big games and also a massive choker. You just don't see that combination very often.
"Defense, Ball pressure, pick and roll offence they're about the same. Pull up and step back I'd say they're the same. Locker room leadership I'd say they're the same. Chris has on overall better offensive game, slightly better handle, slightly better passing, but that's about it. CP3 may be top 3 PGs of this generation, but Lowry is arguably top 5 when we actually talk about genuine two-way PGs. We're talking the top 0.001% of point guards in human history. They are absolutely comparable. When Chris Paul couldn't play in the Olympics, he told the team that Lowry was the only guy he thought could replace him effectively. He did and they won gold."
"Chris Vernon brought up in a pod last week with KOC that he doesn’t think players show love for Giannis like they do for other great players. When Lebron was at this game most of the social media posts were saying he was there showing love for Booker and Paul, cheering for them. I’m not saying he didn’t cheer for Giannis, but it seems like it was mostly for the other guys Lebron showed love.   Does that seem true, that Hiannis doesn’t get the love that other players seems to get from each other?"
Chris Paul needs Middleton to go back into hiding.
"3 1st picks that all led to generational talents. 2/3 got traded and I expect the 3rd to be on his way out soon considering the Williamson family is silently acting like Lavar Ball. The most cheering you do is for players you trade away.    You're trying to replace Lonzo Ball with Chris Paul/Spencer Dinwiddie/Kyle Lowry who are not coming to NOLA. Considering the overlap of Saints fans, I'm surprised that Pelican fans talk about their franchise like they have any hope. Your offense has no shooters and your defensive effort is pitiful at best. It should've been a big red flag the moment we traded you the 4th pick, and you somehow turned it into Jaxon Hayes and then go out and sign Adams to an absurd extension the following year."
He wasn't elite til 41. Chris Paul has been an all nba caliber player for nearly 13 years. Nash wasn't great for that long.
Iirc Chris Paul hasn’t contracted HIV
"Chris Paul and Blake griffin  6”5 point guard with:  CP3’s passing, ball handling, IQ, midrange   Blake’s athleticism , finishing and strength"
&gt; Chris Paul DID have a bad game 5   &gt; Not a bad game by any stretch
"Also whatever, I get that I could be annoyed by it, but LeBron is there to see Chris Paul. One of his best friends has the chance to win his first finals, of course he’s pulling for him and rooting against the other guy."
I hate Chris Paul more than anyone but this is a weird take lol.  Did he have a legacy-defining game? No. Was it a great game? No probably not. But it definitely wasn’t a bad game.  Lol this post is too funny the more I look at it.   Title: “Chris Paul DID have a bad game”  Body: “Not a bad game by any stretch”  Pick one bud
Not talking about Paul this year he’s a floor general extraordinaire I was really referring to younger Hornets Chris Paul that’s what Trae game reminds me of
"First of all, this is the play where Chris Paul fell down untouched. Second, lol stop it"
"Ever get the feeling that, after Game 2, Adam Silver called Chris Paul to remind him that ""A seven game series is good for the league, if you get my drift."""
I'm not seeing it. Chris Paul is hurt and if Booker has to step up and drop 40 again
"I definitely don't think it's over but I'd be amazed if the Suns went into Milwaukee and pulled off Game 6  The Bucks and their crowd are gonna be fired up more than ever before and the energy will probably be overwhelming for the Suns. Booker has given the Suns 40+ in two straight games and they came up with Ls both times, in one of those games the Bucks only shot 24% from 3, in another the Suns were at home and also got 21 from Chris Paul.   I don't think it's likely Booker replicates his performance from the past two games, and more importantly...the Suns have not stopped or so much as limited Giannis a single game in this series. He has gotten over 30 in every single game, that is the constant. So you can be assured he will more than likely do the same...and in the event that happens, he'll only need just one of Jrue or Middleton to have a big game again and the Suns are buried (Bucks have won the 3 games that Giannis got big contribution from either one of them, and even in the 2 they lost they were close battles with Jrue and Khris playing terrible) If the role players are also shooting well that'll do the Suns in too. Bottom line is there's a wider margin for error with the Bucks and very thin margin for the Suns and the Suns are going to be on the road in a hostile environment.  The Suns will probably need another big performance from Booker, and from Paul, and their role players will have to be involved hitting 3s, probably need Ayton to have a solid game as well. All of this has only happened in 2 of the 5 games. Other huge problem is defensively Ayton is literally the only one on the Suns that can even halfway bother Giannis....and without Ayton on the court the Suns have literally no size. Far too many things working against Phoenix. Would be an amazing feat or huge choke from Milwaukee to steal it on Tuesday"
So I guess it's Hate Chris Paul day lol

Prime Chris Paul plus actually good wings is a recipe for success for sure
2nd behind Chris Paul
"Bruh you can't be serious..  A plant based diet is extremely beneficial. Chris paul went vegan, now he never breaks down and has been killing it since."
"I really don't feel good in saying this, but I've heard his interviews. He might be the least intelligent person I've heard speak since the Kardashians. His brothers can turn it on and obviously are brilliant on the court at seeing things happen.   Doesn't mean they're going to be stars, but it's something they have going for them. LiAngelo,though? Holy shit. I want to see him break down tape with Chris Paul. It would be traumatizing."
chris paul is an absolute lock for top 10 and kyrie isn’t even sniffing it yet.
If Harden actually quit he’d be averaging 15ppg like Vince did. And what’s even your point with Chris Paul?
As someone who has alway been a defensive minded player their whole life.... I'd much rather be an offensive minded player. Defense is important and don't ever forget it but it's how you do both. By that I don't mean two way players. I think back on the days when (not reddit specifically) chris paul or whatever guard was better than Curry because they were a two way player. Whatever skill is more integral to your team and important to your team is what matters. Defense is great unless that is all you can do. Put points on the board first and then show me how well you can stop your matchup.
I think in terms of scoring when he's 34 he's gonna be similar to Chris Paul. Never drives to the basket but it doesn't matter because he shoots like 37% from 3 and 50% from mid range
Lol Chris Paul quit on our team all of 2019. Stfu.
"shouldn't excuse him for quitting on his team, he still needs to be professional.  You see Chris Paul elevating every team he's been on even though he got dumped to what we thought were going to be bad teams and he did well."
"And Ariza should have stopped being fed after going 0-6 or 0-7.  0-27 is James Harden’s legacy right now. Tell me that Chris Paul, LeBron James, Steph Curry, hell even guys from past generations like Bird or Jordan would keep dishing it out to a shot that’s missed 20 times already. Every guy I’ve listed has a great playoff win in their resume because they either knew how to take over themselves or knew how to feed the hot hand. It’s about individual game feel and i never get the sense that Harden’s game feel is elite like those other guys. He’s made a living (a killing more accurately) playing the numbers, but playing the numbers doesn’t win you a ring."

See the common theme here? There's always a lack of chemistry or disagreement. On the court or off... And Harden always gets his way.  The ""1 year"" portion was not literal.. but to make a point.  Lmk if you want more receipts"
"What the fuck is this take lmao. Harden hasn’t done shit to make you trust him as the piece to take you over the top anymore than Simmons or Giannis. He went to 1 finals, 9 years ago, as the third best player on the team. Aside from that season he made 2 conference finals. One year was the greatest playoff collapse of the 2010s *that included a game he was benched during*, and the other he magically lost a 3-2 lead with Chris Paul injured for game 6 and 7.  Is Philly a piece away? Sure. Is Harden that piece? We have 0 evidence to make us believe that."
"Chris Paul is a good dude off the court, just a little dirty on the court."
Chris Paul is still an ass off the court too.
We call that the “Chris Paul” around these here parts son
Chris Paul is up there too
That's pretty much about it. Could also add Chris Paul.      But I think it was very clear that Wade was the clear 2nd best player from 2008-09 season to 2010-11 season with Bryant having a down season in 2010-11.      The only player close to Wade was James even though James was the better one.
"It was an interesting down season by Bryant but he wasn't a top 3 player in 2010-11 season.      The top 3 players in the time frame you're asking;   2009; James, Wade, Bryant   2010; James, Wade Bryant   2011; Wade, Nowitzki, James      Also, Dwight Howard and Chris Paul were closer to be being top 3 than Kevin Durant in that time frame. And Nowitzki was always in the mix."

I mean you got chris paul on your team. You have to defer to him.
"I'd say the third spot was more between Chris Paul and Wade than Durant and Wade, even if Durant was obviously a great talent right from the bat."
Chris Paul is really really good at playing basketball
"Chris Paul, Jimmy Butler, Derrick Rose, and Russell Westbrook are ahead of him in my book as far as deserving and honestly there’s probably more that i’m not thinking of or am on the fence about. Beal is a stud though and he deserves more success"
Getting Chris Paul is an automatic COTY candidacy it seems.  Maybe we should just give it to him.
I honestly thought Chris Paul was one of the best midrange shooters. Might’ve just been prominent since he was with the rockets.
Chris Paul calling the NBA snitch line.
Aye bro you have the white chris paul now so thats a good consolation
"If Chris Paul/Devin/Ayton are healthy this team isn’t an easy out for anybody. Start checking out the games, this team is fun and really good."
Andrew Wiggins was fantastic. Dude played all world defense on kawhi and had a cross that he picked up with the same hand into a jumper that was Chris Paul-esque.
Tyrese Haliburton looked like Chris Paul. Corey Joseph looked like Piss Crawl.
"Before MDA quit, he gave the FO a long-shot ultimatum to trade Melo for Deron Williams, which lines up with what you're saying.   Sometimes I still think about what could have been if the Melo trade never happened. I loved that team with Amar'e, Gallo, Landry Fields, Raymond Felton, and Wilson Chandler. What if the Knicks traded for Chris Paul or Deron Williams instead?"
"But Magic's defense &gt;&gt;&gt; than Curry defense. Curry is phenomenal, but in these all time great line ups there's no reason not to have 5 players that are elite on both sides of the ball. If you really wanted a shooting PG I would go with someone like Chris Paul."
chris paul the goat lol
"A lot of people deserve a NBA ring, but there’s a lot of luck involved with winning one. I would argue Chris Paul deserves it more."
it's just not as fun without doc and Chris paul
"I agree. Hoping we get a good draft pick that will light it up next year when fans can go see the team next year.  In the meantime, I will be obviously rooting for a Raptors win tonight, but if not, I'm fine with the Suns being a top-seeded team with a deep playoff run this season. Devin Booker and Chris Paul deserve it."
"I care because I want to watch the game. Them not playing would change nothing about my perspective on what's happening today, it's disgusting and I don't need Chris Paul to tell me that"
"harden and lebron was 7 years ago. curry's was in 2015. so that tells you how much they actually pay attention these days lol  and i don't think chris paul was actually fined, though, right? i thought he was just *warned*"
"If Harden could have accepted that Chris Paul was the better leader, that Rockets team would still be dang scary.  That first season they got together was Harden's best defensive season of his career and that went a long way towards helping them get the best record in the league and in getting Harden the MVP.  Things fell apart in the playoffs, and then you get Harden not playing as hard on D, conflict with Paul, Paul not willing to risk injury for a team going like that, and all of it ending with Paul being dealt in a trade that was almost completely slanted towards the Thunder.  Westbrook's got some amazing skills at his disposal, but I'd rather have Chris Paul every time."
"the best argument for the Suns tbh is that I think they had a chance of making the playoffs this year even without a Chris Paul trade, they can overcome 15-20 games that he might miss with their defense. Tbh the biggest issue for the Suns right now is their starting lineup right now is no good not nearly effective enough yet and they are still 5-2 due to their bench and other contributors"
payton Pritchard is white chris Paul
"This is pre-peak Durant. Durant was a poor defender and passer at the time, and wasn't at his peak shooting prowess. In 2010/11 for instance, Durant shot 46/35/88, which is good but not otherworldly, had the same amount of assists as Amar'e Stoudemire, and graded as a negative on defense. The zeitgeist top 5 at the time went (in no order) LeBron, Kobe, Dwight, Rose, Durant, with honorable mentions to Wade, Melo, Nowitzki, and Chris Paul.   Here's a Grantland article that has Dwight second overall.   https://grantland.com/features/sports-guys-vault-nba-trade-value-2011/"
"The ōn was a term for being, everything, the universe, the eternal dao. Ontology is the study of being. Ontological means to do with the logic of being— the assignments of levels, concepts, and categories to everything.   The journalist’s joke, as I take it, is that Chris Paul’s statement was just on the level of differentiating between the object Chris Paul and the object James Naismith."
Chris Paul would point out that Patty Mills’ shoelaces violated NBA protocol and therefore void any points he scored while wearing them
"Chris Paul would lose his shit. He also wouldn't hesitate to pull the same shit, himself."
"I said contending team, not necessarily a title winning team. I just don't see that Stockton lifting a team like Nash did in 2005 or things like that. Also, Stockton wouldn't thrive without an all time great scorer next to him.      Here's a comparison between Stockton, Nash, Paul and Zeke in terms of postseason performances against good defensive teams (-2.0 or better relative DRtg);      &gt; Stockton from 1989-90 to 1996-97 (1990 playoffs was the first playoffs prime Stockton faced a -2.0 or better rDRtg team);   15.5/2.9/12.6/2.4 and 3.3 tpg on .616 ts in regular season (.536 ts league average)   14.7/3.4/11.3/1.8 and 3.1 tpg on .566 ts in 94 playoff games   14.5/3.4/11.2/1.7 and 3.0 tpg on .559 ts in 73 playoff games against -2.0 or better rDRtg teams      ---      &gt; Nash from 2001-02 to 2009-10 against good defensive teams;   16.9/3.3/9.9/0.8 and 3.2 tpg on .614 ts in regular season (.532 ts league average)   18.8/3.7/9.8/0.6 and 3.5 tpg on .589 ts in 100 playoff games   19.8/3.9/9.8/0.6 and 3.6 tpg on .599 ts in 61 playoff games against -2.0 or better rDRtg teams   (In Phoenix;   17.0/3.5/10.9/0.7 and 3.5 tpg on .628 ts in regular season (.539 ts league average)   20.0/3.7/10.7/0.5 and 3.8 tpg on .604 ts in 67 playoff games   20.7/4.0/10.8/0.6 and 3.8 tpg on .602 ts in 43 playoff games against -2.0 or better rDRtg teams)     ---       &gt; Chris Paul from 2007-08 to 2017-18 against good defensive teams;   19.1/4.4/10.0/2.3 and 2.4 tpg on .589 ts in regular season (.541 ts league average)   21.4/4.9/8.8/2.2 and 2.6 tpg on .581 ts in 91 playoff games   22.2/5.0/9.1/2.2 and 2.6 tpg on .600 ts in 63 playoff games against -2.0 or better rDRtg teams      ---      &gt; Isiah Thomas from 1983-84 to 1989-90 against good defensive teams;   20.0/3.8/10.3/2.0 and 3.8 tpg on .526 ts in regular season (.540 ts league average)   21.7/4.8/9.0/2.3 and 3.4 tpg on .526 ts in 93 playoff games   24.1/4.6/9.1/2.4 and 4.3 tpg on .555 ts in 20 playoff games against -2.0 or better rDRtg teams      ---      It's hard to be the best player on a contending team while struggling to keep up with 15 ppg against good defensive teams (unless you're Bill Russell).      It's too much of a hyperbole to say Stockton made Malone. Stockton is an all time great. Sure he'd thrive without Malone. The same goes for Karl Malone who was also another all time great."
"Oh yeah, is that why the season when AD sat out because he wanted to get traded Jrue holiday had 7.7 apg? His New Orleans career high with Julius Randle as his second option?  Bro, at this point you just gotta shut up and listen. How can you deny those lol? And he was 13th in **total** assists, not apg. By that metric Spencer Dinwiddie was better than Chris Paul in 2017-2018"
"Jrue was a top ten passer in 2016...  Better players than him:  Chris Paul, Harden, Wall, Westbrook, Lebron, Rubio, Rondo.   After that you could argue Jrue is there. The people following him are: Teague, Bledsoe, Conley, Steph, Lillard, T.J. McConnell, etc, all of whom you could Argue Jrue was better than.  He also has a top 10 assist percentage that season"
Thats smart as fuck lol. Veteran move.  Complaining Bev iced the free throw shooter is like complaining chris paul got the untucked shirt technical foul.  God this subreddit is soft
Chris Paul
"In this guy's Bizzaroworld I guess so, but for anyone with any sense....no not at all.  That's like saying Chris Paul is a better offensive player than James Harden.   But you'll notice no one is crazy enough to make that argument.   People invent weird criteria to boost Joker."
What if Chris Paul doesn’t get that hamstring injury in the playoff series against the warriors
"Is Jokic better than Chris Paul, though?"
"Gasol and Bogut were really really good. But you're laughing if you think they are in the same league as Jokic. Jokic is better than LeBron, Chris Paul etc. Sabonis was possibly the best passer in the world in his prime although he did co exist with Magic Johnson."
"Definitely. They could use his IQ and defensive presence in games like this. There were some absolutely horrendous decisions made with the ball today by the Lakers.  Not that Caruso is Chris Paul with it, but he definitely plays in his lane as good as any player I’ve seen."
"It’s funny how much you’re overrating regular season performance and neglecting playoff performance. No one gives a shit about regular season performance if the player goes on to ball out in the playoffs anyways.   Let me paint you a picture:   -	Chris Paul gets injured in February 2010. Team misses playoffs. -	Chris Paul gets injured in the playoffs in 2015, missing two games in the rockets series. -	Chris Paul gets injured in the playoffs in 2016 after up 2-1.  -	Chris Paul gets injured against the warriors in 2018 up 3-2. -	Chris paul has an injury ridden season all of 2019 and never gets back to 100% for the playoffs.  Availability is the best ability."
"Yes I knew all of those things and it was very widely known at the time that zeke was saving everything for the playoffs in the late 80s, in which he balled out and won 2 championships. Guess what, having 1 FMVPs is still 1 more than the amount cp3 has, 2  more than the amount of titles he has, and 3  more than the amount of finals appearances he has.  And finally most importantly of all, availability is the best ability. And Chris Paul got injured too many times for it to matter."
"Fit matters though. I mean, Harden's Rockets are a great example of that with Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, and now John Wall (because Harden's leaving) all having fairly short stints playing alongside him.  Another great example is that Olympic team real early in LeBron's career where it seemed like he was the only one playing hard and they lost to Puerto Rico. They would have been better off only taking NBA players that wanted to be there instead of just the biggest stars they could get.  Fit matters way more than some people think."
Lmao you cannot be for real. You say prime DJ like he was a superstar or something . He was an above average rim running center that chris paul turned into all nba first team. And check out some of Redicks numbers in playoff series. There were stretches where he was shooting under 20 percent. Blake was incredibly unreliable in the playoffs. His lack of shooting abilty got routinely exposed
Better based on chris paul being better at almost every aspect of basketball than Zeke. Chris Paul also historically ups his production in the playoffs while maintaining elite efficiency so I don't know what your point is.
Guess the player to hate this month is Chris Paul.
How would Chris Paul make devin booker turn the ball over less
"But...but....Chris Paul makes everyone better I thought......now I don't know what to believe in....sea horses...from now on, my faith lies in the mighty sea horse and it's seed....."
He is been literally called one of the best PG because of his offense + defense . Do you seriously believe Chris Paul is top offensive PG?

"My theory is the previous owner wanted one last championship run before he sold the team, so he ordered Morey to go all in on Chris Paul. All those lost assets would kill the Rockets long term, but that would be the new owner's problem, not his. **Just a theory**"

Morey knew Fertitta was gonna can him after the Hong Kong thing so he sabotaged the franchise in the chris Paul trade
Chris Paul?  Steph  32/5.5/6.5
Chris Paul is overrated by this sub no player avging 13 pts 8 assist with 53% TS is winning mvp
"OKC and Point Guards  Westbrook, Chris Paul, SGA."
Lou is a combo guard and prototypical 6th man do to his strengths and weaknesses. Schroeder was behind Chris Paul. Rose is a bench scorer playing behind a first round pick/pg of the future.      None of them fit the criteria here. If Quickley is a starter level player on this roster he should start.
And next to [Chris Paul intentionally fouling Dwight Howard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4UajWOxOXo)
chris paul
"Actually he’s done everything to suggest he can give up something to win a ring. Became the point guard in 2016 because d’antoni wanted him to be the playmaker more. Gave up the ball a lot in 2017 when chris Paul came in. Chris Paul struggles to stay healthy in 2018, forcing harden to adapt a more isolation heavy offense. Westbrook comes in 2019, the team trades their only solid center in capela to completely mold the offense around westbrook, completely eliminating the harden capela pick and roll that had been so effective for years. The better question would be what hasn’t he given up to win? Because to say he’s done nothing and run his teammates out of town is just dumb."
If his name was Chris Paul he probably would have been an all star last year
"There were a lot of deserving candidates (D Rose, Melo, Howard) but I’d go with Chris Paul. The man was seen as an untouchable contract, and people had all but written him off as an average PG... all for him to go and lead OKC to the playoffs, be the statistically “clutchest” player in the league, and earn an All-Star nod."
Chris paul abd booker
Atlanta choosing Marvin Williams over Chris Paul.
"Magic had defensive versatility, but he wasn't actually all that good of a defender - he was just a lot bigger than the other guards he was typically on.  For a better defensive PG, I'd go with Chris Paul or John Stockton. They're both awesome facilitators and absolutely pesky in the best possible way on defense. Personally, I lean towards Stockton because he's that little bit better of a passer and that little bit better on defense, but tons more durable. Chris Paul is the better scorer and he's a little bit more accurate of a passer, so he's got the little bit better assist to turnover ratio.  Both are dang good choices though."
"Oh yeah, definitely. Like I said, it's dang close because they're all such smart players. And LeBron totally is a basketball savant.  I've seen interviews with Curry, Chris Paul, and Draymond where they've all shown off their amazing memories too. It's actually a pretty common trait among the folks with top notch BBIQ because that's another way to figure everything out - being able to remember how each player tends to play the game."
Couldn't even bring them as far as a 42 year old Chris Paul could with a far worse supporting cast
"I'd actually put LeBron third behind Draymond and Chris Paul because while LeBron is absolutely a basketball savant, he's got access to physical gifts and talents that Draymond and Paul don't have - they're even both on the small side for their positions and need to use BBIQ to cover for that.  But really, it's dang close because they're all such smart players."
"&gt; He's out Chris Bosh/Kevin Love.  I think he's more of a Paul Pierce guy for us (not as good but similar role). Honestly at least so far, our starters kind of line up a bit with the Doc Rivers Celtics  Simmons - Rondo (good passers and defenders with poor shooting)  Ray Allen - Seth Curry (elite shooting)  Tobias - Paul Pierce (well-rounded forward who can create his own shot when the offense isn't clicking as a team)  Embiid - KG (Paint monster on both ends)  Danny Green - James Posey (total 3&amp;D with probably better defense than shooting)  ______________  Now I'm not saying these players are on the same levels or are identical, but it is funny how there are some striking similarities just in terms of player archetype lol"
"He's my top pick, but I'd also put LeBron and Chris Paul in that conversation."
Chris Paul makers things different.
This next to Chris Paul jumping at Deandre Jordan to put the ball back at the buzzer
Chris Paul has been doing this for over a decade
HELLO? CHRIS PAUL IS TRYING TO BEAT ME UP
Its my favorite point guard Chris Paul
"chris paul was absolutely not an all star in 2019, there’s a reason people thought the westbrook trade was fine at the time, he looked pretty washed"
"“Chris Paul, Kawhi Leonard, and Lou Will never scored 35 points while making 7+ 3’s while playing for the clippers”  That’s basically what this stat says."
 Chris Paul
"See how’s stupid you are? When did I say 2018? It was their last series against each other and KD was injured for the last game and a half. So is Curry’s fault that Chris Paul was ass?   Let me rephrase it for you. Rockets Harden has never ever eliminated Curry  in the playoffs, how many times have Curry sent your ass and harden’s home? Is the reason why you’re so bitter  Harden will always be a perennial loser"
"The Warriors without KD were still a far better team than the Rockets were  Chris Paul had the worst season of his career lol, my dude was on year 1 of the plant based diet transition  Tbh that take only comes from casuals who didnt actually watch the games"
"I know Rockets fan are delusional but not like this. guess you have amnesia because KD didn’t play game 7 and got injured in game 6. That’s was the perfect time for Harden, Chris Paul and a very good Rockets team to send the a Warriors with a crappy bench home and guess what happened? They got sent home because Harden just isn’t a winner and will never be."
Curry got abused on the defensive end by Chris Paul in the playoffs. We forced a switch every time
"Well that's just you being disingenuous IMO, his team was at a massive talent disadvantage, and the only reason they had a chance in that series was because of Harden, he was the only shot creator on that team once CP3 went down, and the other 2 team had 2 MVPs, and another 20+ PPG scorer in Klay, arguably the best 3rd option of all-time (well until now with this Nets team...).   Harden is just a worse version of LeBron. LeBron always lost to better teams, until he stacked the deck and made the best team and won championships. Even the Finals he's lost in 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, he gets a pass for because again, he lost to better teams and nobody rightfully holds that against them because there's an acknowledgement of the talent disadvantage he was at.   KD lost to better teams in 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2016, until he stacked the deck in his favor and won championships.  You say LeBron took GS without Kyrie and Love to 6, and yeah, he did, but he didn't actually win that series and he was horribly inefficient. Does anybody *blame* him for that? No. Nobody sane does.   Harden took the 2019 Warriors to 6 with a decrepit Chris Paul who was useless for the first 5 games of that series, and yet somehow he gets blame for that? That series was INSANELY close, 2-2 after the first 4 games, with none of the games in that series being decided by more than 6 points. If you want to argue that he could've done better once KD went out, sure, but if anything that proves what every sane basketball fan believes, which is that Steph Curry &gt; James Harden. Klay Thompson was also a better #2 option than CP3 was at that time given his injuries, so again, he was at a talent disadvantage.   Point is, that Harden has never lost to any team where he was the favorite, where he had the better team. Now, you can argue that's what makes you a truly great player in this league.   However, has Kevin Durant done that before? Has Kawhi Leonard done that before?  Hell, has LeBron done that before?   It's really, really fucking hard to win a championship, which is why these superstars just stack the deck in their favor to try and increase the odds. The NBA has never been more like Game of Thrones than it is right now."
I find it hilarious that y’all bring up old ass Chris Paul when Steph has played with Klay and KD lmaoo. This shit is not even comparable. The Warriors were always a better team. The best player he’s played with is a post prime Cp. Y’all hold him to insane standards
"So are we just gonna ignore the fact that Chris Paul got injured! &amp; Yes Westbrook is an MVP but lets not act like he was a player known for winning, not even KD could win with him. Its not all on Harden"
"I don’t think Shaq is right. All the players the rockets “gave” Harden were problematic.   Howard was already a bust in himself and not an elite level player at all. The pairing of Harden &amp; Chris Paul sounded problematic from the get go, as did Westbrook. Nobody thought: Damn those two players really compliment each other. It was forced and it never made sense. Harden never got a bonafide star that stays healthy &amp; matches his game."
Chris Paul recently said on JJ Redick's podcast that the team was preparing the whole season for the warriors by switching everything. It almost worked out in the end.
"Chris Paul is a better number 2 option than any of the other number 2 options the other stars facing the Warriors had. Harden's only wins against the 2017-2019 Warriors were with Chris Paul playing he didn't win one game against them without CP3.  Against the Kd-less Warriors in 2015 Harden lost to them in 5 games.  Against the Kd AND STEPH less Warriors in 2016 Harden lost in 5 games also. Steph only played 2 games in this series so yes Harden lost Games 2, 3, and 6 to just the Klay and Draymond Warriors.  Then in 2018 he takes the Warriors 7 games with CP3 but can't win one game without CP3 (Game 7).  Then Harden lost to the Warriors again without KD in Game 6 2019 (and Game 5 when Kd actually went down too)."
Who are you talking about? I'm talking about chris paul
His state farm commercials with Chris Paul were pretty funny
"&gt;h KD Chris Paul and Westbrook.  ""hey guys he played with two guys thbat were hurt and past their prime haha stop being spoiled"""
Harden played with KD Chris Paul and Westbrook. That excuse is out the window. The Rockets failed because Harden played for MVP titles and scoring titles and personal glory. Because he thought basketball was 1 v 5 sport. And when he finally figured out it wasn’t he blamed his team and fucked them over and bandwagoned on a super team.   Seriously fuck Harden. I’m tired of selfish divas ruining the sport.
"It’s not his fault Chris Paul didn’t play in 2018, we would have won other wise"
Chris Paul did the same thing last year
"Yeah, reports came out he injured chris paul's hamstring while twisting his leg, because chris paul said he had b-cup man boobs"
"I think he still gave it his all. He still played 40 minutes and averaged close to 30-7-6.   people are cherry picking games, but its the playoffs were they not trying as hard in game 1- or which ever other game?  THe defense got better, and harden had watered down talent each year.  Remeber depth matters, the 4 minutes in the 2nd of the bench score goes to the same score at the end of the game and can prevent closer games, people underestimate the value of depth and playing 45 minutes  and in thsi case or example after rockets best year, they didn't resign ariza despite him wanting to and having bird rights and only getting a one year high priced deal so no risk to future flexibilty what so ever let alone a trade asset.  We replaced him with James ennis who was in mikes 8 man short rotation. months later we swapped him for a 2nd round swap.  While in contention. Simply put, TIllman demanded better results with a worse product  Then he had the gal to go volunteer to the press and say this team needs to have a killer mentality, mind you chris paul was on this team, and he would be the one to instill it on him.    Hes a joke o a boss, louder than dolan, but cheaper. So you get dollar value dolan and harden gets the blame while paying high useage,minutes, and games in a time of load management."
"So are we just gonna ignore the fact that Chris Paul got injured! &amp; Yes Westbrook is an MVP but lets not act like he was a player known for winning, not even KD could win with him. Its not all on Harden"
"Harden gets blame of course he was the leader, but someone want to tell this dude what he actually did in the ploayoffs?  As usual shaq and barkely are entertaining, but they just have knee jerk emotional reactions for their own generation. Both have wanted out and were known to be out of shape and or lazy at times in their career.  Harden has been close to 40 minutes, 30 ppg, 7-6 almost for the last 4 season IN the playoffs.  He was less efficient, kobe and mj had those too. No doubt his game needed more diversity. But sometimes the guy whose carrying everything while the owner waters down the product, for example they replaced their glue guy vet championship 3/d ariza after their best year for James ennis. He was in mikes short 8 man rotation and we traded him for a 2nd swap that very season...then tillman had the gal to say after they lost they need a killer instinct from him, this was a chris paul team tat the owner went to the media with by the way.  How about not watering down the product and demanding better results like your restaurant.  Harden could've and can do better, he has blame in this. but the trajectory of this franchise changed with tillman. Harden plays heavy minutes, high games, useage ini a time of load management.  He does things for a marathon of 3-4 season leading in points, assist while he is a target each night for anyone wanting to make a name...that takes some damn resilience and commitment.     Shaq is an idiot and contradicts himself each time.  That siad, LOVE this show and never break up Ernie, Kenny, and charles."
"Multiple articles state that CP3 was traded due to tension between the two players.  &gt; per Yahoo Sports' Vincent Goodwill, who relayed the following quote from a league source: ""James made this [expletive] happen. He wanted Chris up out of there.""  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2845241-report-james-harden-was-behind-rockets-trading-chris-paul-to-thunder  &gt; the Houston Rockets decided to trade Chris Paul to the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for a package that included Russell Westbrook, in part due to behind-the-scenes issues between Paul and Rockets superstar James Harden.  https://hoopshype.com/2020/12/03/chris-paul-rockets-return-on-investment-rumors-trade/"
"Missing Chris Paul that game and I think Eric Gordon as well. Rockets down 20 the whole game. They slowly clawed their way back and Harden hit a shot to send it  to OT. Definitely one of his best regular season games as a Rocket.   Up there with his 60pt triple double against Orlando, where he carried the bench with pretty much all the starters out. Broke the Rockets franchise record for points in a game that night."
"Obviously the man isn't faultless. That Chris Paul team was great but I think it's a reach to say they could've won a ring when they already tried and failed. Also there were doubts about how that team played because the entire offense revolved around Harden, and relied heavily on threes.  He then asked for a trade after John Wall and Cousins joined the team because that clearly wasn't going to get him a ring. I don't know why anyone is acting like he should've stayed there and wasted his prime years. After being Houston's best player for years he deserves to get a trade if he wants to. He started bitching because it seemed unlikely anything was going to happen. But then the next day he got traded so turns out his bitching worked."
"But he didn't try everything. Did he try getting along with Chris Paul? Did he try staying engaged in plays when he wasn't iso-ing?   CP3 said he was unhappy with Harden for never moving off-ball. I still have yet to see Harden try that.  Harden didn't point the finger towards anyone but he also isn't accepting any responsibility. Houston had a team capable of getting him a ring with Chris Paul and he forced management to trade CP3 for Westbrook because they were friends and he didn't like Chris Paul. Then, when that didn't work out, he demanded they trade him. When they didn't immediately do that, he began disrespecting his teammates, coach, the organization, and the league."
"BPA&gt;Fit has backfired too.   ATL drafted ""BPA"" Marvin Williams when they already had Joe Johnson, Josh Smith, Al Harrington, and Josh Childress as wings. In doing so, they passed up ""better fit"" prospects like Chris Paul and Deron Williams, even though they badly needed a PG.   Then the next year they drafted another ""BPA"" forward, Shelden Williams, instead of ""better fit"" Brandon Roy. By the time they realized their mistake, they had to trade Shelden Williams for a washed, overpaid Mike Bibby.   Or how about MIN drafting 2 ""BPA"" PGs in a row (Rubio, Johnny Flynn)? Or the Clippers drafting 2 PFs in a row (Chris Wilcox, Melvin Ely), when they already had Elton Brand and Chris Kaman?   DET drafted BPA Darko when they already had Ben Wallace at C, instead of better fit Chris Bosh to replace Elden Campbell (though they eventually traded for Sheed to fill the PF spot).   PHI went BPA Fultz when they already had Simmons at PG, instead of better fit Tatum to replace Robert Covington/Dario Saric.   MIL chose BPA Jabari Parker when they already had Giannis at PF, instead of better fit Embiid to replace Zaza Pachulia.   NY picked Jordan Hill when they already had David Lee at PF, instead of better fit Demar Derozan to replace Jared Jeffries.   UTA picked BPA Trey Lyles when they already had Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors at forward, instead of better fit Devin Booker to replace Rodney Hood.   ORL drafted BPA Mo Bamba when they already had Vucevic at C, instead of better fit Collin Sexton to replace DJ Augustin.  You can find examples to support either approach. There's no single correct way."
"He's the one who told the front office it's either him or Chris Paul.  Then when the replacement didn't work he wanted out.  They gave him everything he wanted, it didn't work, then he made it seem like it was entirely the front office's fault."
"He had 32-6-6-4-1 that game, he shot poorly from three but he was fouled on like half of them with no call. While playing without Chris Paul against 4 allstars. What exactly did you expect him to do? Ariza went 0-12 while kd and steph and klay are bombing away from three and harden keeps getting fouled with no call   https://youtu.be/aYveyAb6mvU"
"Bro, Harden played with Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, and Westbrook again. CP3 got hurt at a bad time but come the fuck on. Stop pretending like he's never had quality teammates. His style of play just doesn't work in the playoffs. Selfish basketball doesn't win playoffs."
"No. His offense isn’t all that you can ask for. He doesn’t do anything when he doesn’t have the ball. He is a zero threat. Watch Lebron, Jimmy Butler, Curry. They may take some offensive plays off or play decoy. But they are also still vital pieces of the offense when they don’t have the ball. This is what drove Chris Paul crazy. Harden literally just stands around the perimeter if he doesn’t have the ball. Anyway, we shall see how Hardens lack of off ball movement works with Kyrie and Durant. Or, if he learns how to play off ball. The dude has all the tools."
"1. LeBron 2. Giannis 3. KD 4. AD 5. Steph 6. Kawhi 7. Harden 8. Dame 9. Luka 10. Jokic 11. Embiid 12. Paul George 13. Bradley Beal 14. Jayson Tatum 15. Devon Booker 16. Jimmy Butler 17. Jaylen Brown 18. KAT 19. Ben Simmons 20. Kyrie 21. CJ 22. Khris Middleton 23. Sabonis 24. Brandon Ingram 25. Chris Paul 26. Trae Young  I would take any of these players over Westbrook in a heartbeat and I'm probably forgetting others. He might compete for that next spot with Donovan Mitchell, Zach Lavine, and Vucevic."
"So FG% is the only stat that matters? We don’t look at what % of those were threes, how many free throws he took, how many assists, rebounds or fuck even *points*? Do you not see how ridiculous that sounds?  Also, he wasn’t even bad in most of them. In 2020 russ was complete garbage while harden was good, I don’t see how you blame that on him. In 2019 he averaged 35/7 on 60% TS and had a big game 6 even tho they lost, Chris Paul was a couple steps down from his usual self, and in 2018 they had golden state beat until Chris Paul went down and harden faced them alone, still didn’t even play bad in game 7 he had 32/6/6/4/1 even tho he shot a bit poorly. You have to go back to 2017 to see harden exit in a horrible game."
Chris Paul at point guard  James Harden at SG  LeBron at SF  KD at PF
"Imagine trading firsts for tax avoidance purposes and nothing else though.  That’s different than what you’re talking about.  We did trade firsts for the Chris Paul trade that worked for one year. It was a great year.  Outside of that one year, harden never had anything close to a title team."
What about Ben Simmons and Jamal Murray? Blake Griffin? Chris Paul? There are a lot of guys making the max who clearly don't/didn't want to be traded.
He did do a lot for them. And anyone who thinks he had a competitive squad besides 2018 Rockets is delusional. Chris Paul injury really messed up his career... And he hasn't had a healthy guy since then in the playoffs... Teams literally double him after half court..
Proximity from Chris Paul has decreased or increased depending on how you use the word I guess.
"Shaq is right here, but I'm curious how much the conversation around Harden would be had Chris Paul not gotten injured in Game 5 of 2018 and the Rockets finished off the Warriors to get to the Finals against the Cavs."
Dame is still here. You’re phrasing makes it seem like he’s retired or sum. But Harden will get his jersey retired and rightfully so. The guy is a generational talent no matter what people will say. He was a healthy Chris Paul away from winning the championship. Not to mention he’s a year or two away from seeing prime window close. He wants to win a ring.
" ""You asked for Dwight. We gave him to you. You asked for Chris Paul. We gave him to you. You asked for shooters. We gave 'em to you. You asked for Westbrook, your homeboy from little league, we gave him to you. When you say you gave everything, I say no you didn't cuz the last 5 elimination games, you're 1-4, shooting 41%.""  Really didn't think Shaq was going to respond to the trade this way. I am honestly surprised."
"finney-smith can guard 1-5  among his most frequent matchups:  murray, chris paul, lavine, harden, millsap, lebron, gasol, olynyk"
Huh? James Harden *wanted* Chris Paul out. They didn't get along at all and there was a quote from him after their 2019 semifinals loss which heavily implied that he wanted him out. Do you also think that that move occurred without Harden being okay with it?  CP3 was also looking completely washed in 2019. A player with his injury history and age wasn't a very good bet to have the resurgence he did in Oklahoma City.
The memes are funny but yeah it's weird that people actually believe it beyond just jokes. Harden wanted cp3 who was prob the most ball dominant player at the time outside him and Russ. Then he wanted chris paul gone for one of the few players more ball dominant than paul. And before both of em he wanted ty lawson.   Overall Harden has been pretty vocal over the years that he likes playing next to another point guard
"I don't think that people don't like super teams: FANS LOVE SUPER TEAMS!!!  They are fun to watch.   What they don't like is KD, Harden, and Kyrie.  They are not terribly likeable guys based on the way they engage with the media and/or teammates.   Kyrie's ego wouldn't let him play in LBJ's shadow (who he threw shade on for not hitting clutch shots when he DID hit clutch shots), spoke down about his Boston teammates (they did better without him), and his Nets teammates (claiming they were a couple pieces away from contending when they had a better record with him sitting out). Then ran a coach out of town when he wasn't even on the court to help the team? Like WTF?!?!?  You got Harden, who is iso-ball-hog, throwing his teammates under the bus recently when he is the one who showed up out of shape and has bee shooting about as well as Yinka Dare.  He pushes a team to trade for guys (CP3, Westy) and then runs them out of town because he doesn't want to take ownership of how his inability to move off the ball limits his team's success when he's not bringing the ball up.   &amp;#x200B;  Then you got KD, who I personally don't mind, but whom a lot of fans don't respect because he 'broke his cherry with a sex worker'.  Whatever. I didn't blame LeBron for going to Miami to play with talent so he could learn to win, and I don't mind KD doing that (though I do take issue with the credit he seemed so happy to take when GSW won).  I even respect that he left so that he could get out there and do it on his own.    But those three guys? A lot of fans just don't like THEM.   &amp;#x200B;  If Leonard, AD, and LeBron had all teamed up, nobody would despise them the way people despise the Nets.  Sure, there would be people sick of the Lakers winning, but people would actually like those guys.   If Giannis had waited to sign a new contract and then teamed up with, let's say AD and Chris Paul in New York, people wouldn't hate them the way people hate Brooklyn.   &amp;#x200B;  So people want to see selfish players lose because they are selfish.   And they will lose because they are selfish.   KD is going to want to brag about how he was able to set himself apart from great players on his team. Kyrie will ask to be traded when the media pays more attention to other guys and they get more credit. Harden is going to alienate the other two by not moving if he doesn't get to bring up the ball.   It will be a disaster.   To be honest, the best case scenario is Kyrie NOT playing all season. The team would be better for it. Harden will get to bring the ball up. KD will get to play off ball. There will be less friction.   In fact, I expect Kyrie to as for a trade any day now.   And then they'll lose this and next season, and all three will opt out and go elsewhere, and the Nets will be kicking themselves because they traded like five years worth of picks away for a two-year rental on the All-NBA Drama team."
"Because that’s before the series ended. Chris Paul got hurt game 5.   KD was the reason the Warriors didn’t get eliminated before that, and the fact that you say eye test Curry played better when literally everyone agreed KD was why they won that series is interesting"
Don't forget Chris Paul
As what? As an overall team affecting player which includes defense and passing? Chris Paul from 2010-2013 was so complete. Harden has also been a monster as a playmaking + scoring machine.
&gt;Harden couldn’t get it done with Westbrook or Chris Paul but he’s going to get it done with a 23 year old of for sure   Do you have a mental disability?
Chris Paul
"right and this is just my interpretation. I personally think to make the hall of fame and be immortalized by the sport's history books, you should have left an absolutely irreplaceable legacy. Lowry is a 1x All NBA player with 1 title as a 2nd or 3rd option against a team missing 2 of it's best players. He's a great player but his legacy isn't to the same level as his contemporaries like Dirk, Chris Paul, Steph, Wade, Duncan, Harden etc..."
"In my ideal Basketball HOF, Lowry would just miss the cut.  He's a 6x Eastern All Star (probably would only have 2-4 if he played in the West against Steph, Lillard, Chris Paul, Westbrook, Harden, Kobe, Luka, Tony Parker, Paul George for the AS guard slot), 1x All NBA and 1 title as a #2/3 option. He had a short but semi successful college career and one gold medal, but it's team USA so how impressive is that really. He's a solid player and any team would be lucky to have him, but he isn't a transcendent talent like Duncan, Dirk, Nash, Kobe, Chris Paul etc...  At his peak he still wasn't a top 5 player in his position. Steph, Lillard, Westbrook and Chris Paul were all clearly better than Peak Lowry (2015-2018) and then guys like Kyrie Irving, John Wall, 2017 Isaiah Thomas, James Harden (if you count his 2015-18 stint as a PG) are all in the same tier.  I think to make the HOF you should be absolutely irreplaceable and left a distinct mark in NBA history, and obviously this is just my interpretation, which means nothing. But Lowry as great as he was/is was replaceable."
https://www.google.com/amp/s/thespun.com/news/report-kyrie-found-out-lebron-pushed-for-a-trade-for-chris-paul/amp  https://twitter.com/funkydiabetic1/status/1329556096462286850?s=21  https://www.google.com/amp/s/boston.cbslocal.com/2019/09/27/kyrie-irving-celtics-nets-media-day-grandfather-boston-failures-nba/amp/  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/lebron-james-2-week-break-turned-his-season-around-2015-4%3famp
His game relies on a good pass first point guard (eg. Chris Paul). Guy doesn't even have a post move.
"Did he get along with Chris Paul? They had the best record in Rockets history and were a win away from the Finals and ended up getting CP3 traded a year later in one of the worst transactions in franchise history.  I have the same question for your second point, Is he? He never gets hurt sure but he notoriously loses efficiency and energy down the stretch of playoff runs. Last year against the Lakers I thought he looked really good but that was also after months of COVID rest."
He got along with Chris paul. He can get along with butler  Hardens also one of the best conditioned guys in the entire league man. He's a fucking tank. Dude plays 38 minutes and never gets hurt all year long
Draft competition seemed key because they gave up so much for Chris Paul
"He kinda did lmao.   &gt;	As a result of the 2019 Chris Paul–for–Russell Westbrook swap, the Thunder own the right to swap either their first-round pick or the Heat’s first pick (which they also own) in the 2021 draft for Houston’s, as long as the Rockets’ pick doesn’t land in the top four.  So the value of that swap just increased"
"The Players a rank higher are in no order are Durrant, Harden, Steph, Jokic, Luka, Lebron, AD,  Lillard,  Leonard, Giannis, Butler, Embiid, Chris Paul, Simmons, Beal. this are all the players a wood pick over him 100% then there are the ones i thing are better but if he comes out and plays his 100% best basketball he will move up on the list but i wood never pick him over any of the ones a name here."
"AD, Lebron, Giannis, Luka, Kawhi, Dame, Steph, Harden, Butler, Tatum, Westbrook, Jokic, Embiid, KD, Jimmy Butler, Chris Paul,  Paul George, Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, Bradley Beal, Andre Drummond."
"guys i cant believe i have to say this, they weren't zigging, zagging, zipping or zamming. They were squapoing before we even knew what squapping was. They got torn apart when Chris Paul got hurt mid squap. They would've reinvented the game had they made the finals that year where no doubt in my mind (there were some doubts but i told em to kick rocks) and beaten the cavs 4-0, which wouldn't have been a sweeping but a squapping"
Bonus:   **[THE 2011 'BASKETBALL REASONS' TRADE](https://imgur.com/cIIChmq)**   **Los Angeles Lakers recieve:**  * Chris Paul   **New Orleans Hornets recieve:**   * Lamar Odom (from LAL)  * Kevin Martin (from HOU)  * Luis Scola (from HOU)  * Goran Dragic (from HOU)   **Houston Rockets recieve:**  * Pau Gasol (from LA Lakers)  Who wins? 😉
"I'm gonna be honest. I was never his biggest fan. I didn't hate him, he was (and still is) a talent with very few peers, and it's been a mostly prosperous decade for the Rockets largely because of him. But I've never liked his attitude. He's always struck me as the kind of player who says what he thinks fans want to hear and then is more about the NBA lifestyle than actually winning. And I'd spend time and energy trying to convince myself otherwise, 'cause as a Rockets fan, I was stuck with him and he was otherwise so good.  I don't have to do that anymore. I can be honest about how I've always felt about the dude. I still don't hate him. I've never really loved the guy, though. I'm nowhere closer to that now than I've ever been.  Also, he and Morey did Chris Paul real dirty. I'm kind of embracing this fresh start, even if it means first round exits for a while. I trust Rafael Stone. I trust Stephen Silas more. I *don't* trust Boogie or Wall's injury prone bodies, but it is what it is. I'm a fan of a team who has dealt with injury prone players before, so I'm ready for it."
"Russ is coming off seasons of  32/10/10/1.5 (MVP)  25/10/10/2  22/11/11/2  27/8/7/1.5 (Bubble/1st year with Harden)  and so far in Washington, his second new team in two years,  20/10/11/1.5       The 4 years before this hes led his teams to records of 44-28 (72 game season), 49-33, 48-34, 47-35,       Over these 5 years hes shot 30/50/77 with 5 TO. Obviously these could be improved, and people can definitely argue that these make him ""worse"", but its not like they are arguing for John Wall/Kemba/Kyrie type players who have been out often the past couple years. Or older players who should understandable be on the decline like Chris Paul.       Russ has put up absurd numbers year after year including all kinds of accolades like MVP, 2x Ast leader, 2x scoring leader, 9x ALL NBA. Its crazy that people act like Russel Westbrook is an insulting benchmark."
Yeah essentially the league owning the hornets and the other owners complained it was giving up their biggest selling point Other than the actual land and brand in Chris Paul. The lakers were sending back no certifiable stud. The other owners thought that would depreciate brand value
New Orleans Hornets. Chris Paul never played for Charlotte
"yep, also the % of their shots that are assisted/unassisted  i mean, Klay Thompson has higher career usage rate than Chris Paul lol"
league didnt block chris paul trade. hornets team ownership blocked the deal and the league happened to own hornets at that time.
"This is a legit trade. If I recall correctly the NBA stopped the Chris Paul - Lakers trade for external reason, not because it would have been unfair for the rest of the league"
Chris Paul is good.
"i mean dwight had an awkward exit from orlando, an awkward exit from LA, then from houston, and then was basically a pariah for like 3 more years before he became a minimum contract ring-chaser.  all i ever heard before we got chris paul was how difficult he was to get along with in clipperland, especially with deandre, because he just never shuts up about certain things (and seemingly didn't with harden despite being on a 65 win team).  russ and kd seemingly didn't get along that well or kd probably doesn't leave.  russ and melo/pg didn't work out.  russ and beal doesn't appear to be off to a good start.  maybe harden is tough to get along with but he hasn't been playing with guys with reputations for creating perfect situations."
I rate dame and I felt like he wanted to redeem himself today which he did    Dame  is Not as talented as a Steph curry or Chris Paul but he is definitely one of the best point guards out there and one of most hard working
It’s because he’s been an obvious head case for years. Before the problem was he wanted the spotlight and attention on every single play. There was no one else good enough on the team for anyone to care but the second Chris Paul showed up it started to create conflict.
Are you joking? People have had issues with Harden since the Chris Paul trade. Before that there was no one else good enough on his team to care that he demanded the attention on every play.
What about Chris Paul? (With other picks/assets involved)
"2018 rockets were very close to making the finals, they were playing great until Chris Paul got injured so I wouldn’t say talent got them, but bad luck after missing all those 3s  Kings, well there’s conspiracies for that series but Shaq and Kobe were dominant"
Chris Paul has been shown to be able to fall back and let Harden do his Iso thing.  Kyrie publicly chafed at being labeled as Robin and the beginning of the end for KD was when GSW didn't pass him the ball when he wanted it.  I selfishly hope for a massive implosion because otherwise this team is scary.
Dwight Howard was the problem  Clint capella was the problem Chris Paul was the problem  Russell Westbrook was the problem  The whole team is the problem so they reformatted and PJ fucking tucker was the center...PJ tucker?? He was always the problem
Davis is hard because he’s very unique. I’d say most similar to Hakeem (also unique in different ways lol) just based on athleticism and being dominant on both sides. Both have insane accuracy when blocking shots and timing to contest without fouling.   Kawhi is a more skilled but less athletic Pippen.   Marcus Smart is a pocket sized Ron Artest.   Can’t think of anyone like Ben Wallace. Just a weird combo to be such an amazing defensive specialist while being that short as a center.   I think Chris Paul and Jason Kidd are pretty similar.
Yeah I think they should’ve rode with Chris Paul
"Lebron is an upgraded Magic Johnson Steph is an offensive minded Steve Nash with the shooting touch of Reggie Miller. Kyrie is a poor-man's Allen Iverson (with the personality too) Chris Paul is a tough Stackton. Drummond is a poor-man's Shaq Derozan is a poor-man's Jordan McGee is a poor-man's Ben Wallace Combine Kawhi and George and you have a 3/4's Larry Bird Davis is Shaq with a shooting touch, or maybe Karl Malone"
Kyrie not gonna be Harden's Chris Paul.
People were worried about Chris Paul and Harden not being successful because they were both “too ball dominant” and things went incredibly well. Durant and Harden as a duo I think to anyone should be an obvious success.   However I do also think Kyrie as a third option is gonna be the hardest player to find a fit for on this team though. He’s got the worst defense of the three and I imagine isn’t in love with the idea of being a third option.
"Lakers, clippers.  Personal favorites... the suns that W/ Chris Paul. Oh and maybe  Harden version of the nets. Throw the rockets in there just cuz. Lol"
He would have one if Chris Paul hadn’t gotten injured
Pels fans and Clippers fans both love J.J. Reddick and Chris Paul. Maybe we should have an NBA alliance  🤔
Yeah cause WB is obviously a winner and Chris Paul is a good teammate. God you people.
"You mean like having Harden and Dwight Howard, or Harden and Chris Paul, or Harden and Westbrook, or KD and Harden and Westbrook, or KD and Westbrook, or Westbrook and Paul George, or Kawhi and Paul George, or I think you get the point."
"He’s a tremendous offensive talent (to me, he is a top 5 offensive player of our generation), but hearing him whine about how the team doesn’t have the talent to win is the final straw. He pushed for the Chris Paul trade, then pushed him out of town. He pushed for the Russ trade, then pushed him out of town. We were on the losing side, asset wise, of both deals but the “win now” mindset drove us to do it. So how can anyone be surprised we’re starved for talent?   Add in the relentless parting and his severe allergy to playing defense, the feeling I get from a lot of rockets fans is that he just doesn’t seem to care as long as he gets his on and off the court.   Don’t get me wrong...he’s been hella entertaining to watch these last few years, but it’s been painful to watch us slowly destroy ourselves for the sake of keeping him happy only for him to cry about us not doing enough."
Can’t believe this trade is not vetoed like Chris Paul to Kobe
Ah the first year is a swap.  That's not as bad as I thought then.   I can definitely see the argument for getting as bad as possible right now to rebuild.  That's basically what New Orleans did after they traded Chris Paul.  They took less talent back but it enabled them to be bad enough to get Davis.
"Yeah hardens shooters have always been sub par, ben mclemore is like the only good catch and shooter he’s ever played with, he was too much of a sieve to play much though, and chris Paul was another but his volume was very low. He’s always passed to mediocre three point shooters so it’s going to be insane to see him break down a defense and have kd/joe Harris/kyrie to hit shots"
"Harden had Chris Paul in the 2018 playoffs, he didn't in the 2017 playoffs."
He owes Chris Paul every dollar he’s made since they started playing together
Jesus. After looking at the top replies (0/27) (Chris Paul Hamstring) Houston Rockets might be a little cursed
"Vince Carter, Tracy McGrady and Chris Paul"
Witnessing one of the greatest scorer in NBA history who should’ve won a title with Chris Paul but didn’t
"Cant ignore Wall and Boogie having near career-ending injuries the past 2 years either, though. So when you go from playing with a former MVP in Westbrook and an All-Star like Chris Paul, you gotta question what the front office is doing; in addition to losing Morey too.  With that said, what Harden said yesterday was completely disrespectful to his teammates for sure. There’s a better way to vent against the front office without having throw your teammates under the bus like that."
on what authority? the only reason stern could block chris paul to the lakers was because the league literally owned the hornets at the time
Remember when the NBA refused to let Chris Paul join the Lakers... good times.
"I’m literally talking about that series individually. I’m not discrediting harden for losing, i am discrediting harden for playing poor individually that series. That series chris paul brought them to within one game, and harden played poorly."
After Parker “””””broke”””” that two years prior  https://thespun.com/news/report-kyrie-found-out-lebron-pushed-for-a-trade-for-chris-paul   Keep telling me about your feelings though.
"They were a historically great team because of Harden and Chris Paul. The rest of that team had nice role players that harden and Paul made so much better. PJ tucker was nothing before he came to play with harden. just a decent defender going from team to team, Harden got Capela the bag, harden lead a 57 win team before chris paul even joined them and took a much better spurs team to 6. Harden made a conference finals way before pringles or chris paul ever got there    KD wasn't even able to beat the non KD version of the warriors, the warriors then added KD a dude who you and most would consider better than anybody on the 2018 rockets and now you say harden is a choker because he couldn't beat them?  Good lord my dude get out of here"
2012-13 lakers*  2011 was when we traded for Chris Paul and got basketball reasoned.
Tbh Chris Paul did.
"I honestly don’t think this helps them, but makes them worse (and crushes the Nets hopes for a future). But how is this not vetoed? If they vetoed Chris Paul to the Lakers wouldn’t you think they’d veto one of the leagues best players going to a team with 2 more of the leagues best players?"
It took Chris Paul 2 quarters to get 14 assists?  Trash!!!  It only took 1 quarter for the legend Steve Blake to get 14 assists
Chris Paul could get me to average 5 points. Dude is insane
Redick’s best year was with Chris Paul
"""Booker and Chris Paul are still feeling each other up"""
Absolutely love watching Chris Paul
Bald Jokic and Chris Paul are exactly what I need at this time on a Friday night.
"LMAO so you make it a point to mention 33 year old Chris Paul along side him but fail to ignore he’s playing prime fucking steph klay kd draymond and damn near had them beat 3-2 until Cp3 went out? You’re clearly just hating on harden at this point. He’s not even the second option right now, he’s contributing to the offense more then durant with his passing, he can score just as much as KD while creating 10+ APG. He’s not a second option"
Deron had earlier playoff success and was the bigger guard. It was 100% a common discuson.   https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/72593-nba-debate-chris-paul-vs-deron-williams.amp.html  https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/72602-why-deron-williams-is-better-than-chris-paul.amp.html
Chris Paul vs Deron Williams was a real thing tho...
"&gt; ""Deron Williams and Chris Paul was a real debate""  This is part of a more general shitty trope in this subreddit, which is people valuing expired hot takes from the past really highly for some reason"
"You’re really discounting he had Chris Paul alongside him as well. And yes, that team was amazing. But they didn’t win it all. And they had Harden since 2012. It just didn’t work out. But he’s in a perfect role now imo. The second option."
"It’s Durant, and it’s not taking away from Chucks career to say that. That’d be like getting offended for calling Steph better than Chris Paul"
He's carried worse than this in the regular season lol. Chris Paul doing amazing at OKC made people forget how much of a carry job Harden's second season was with CP3 was in the regular season with Capela also being regularly injured.
How about 8 first round picks and young players for Harden? How about 4 first round picks and Chris Paul for aging Russell Westbrook? How about 5 first round picks and a young stud for Paul George?
"I think it should be a sequel with Chris Paul, showing the buildup to the asteroid"
"To be fair, books looked out of sorts this year and I'm putting it on the lack of training camp and trying to figure out how to play with Chris Paul. It's hard to say how he'll look by the end of the season"
"If players got routinely ejected for yelling at their teammates, Chris Paul would get ejected within every first quarter."
"&gt;even tho you never defined what an ""era"" even meant.  Do I need to? Is era not clearly defined? Dwight was a starter from 05-19 that's his era. He made his last All Star and All NBA team at the age of 28.  &gt;KD is thr first player in 4 drafts I easily go ""yeah I'd take him over Dwight easy"". I hate to say you're talking out your ass but it kind of seems like you are.  Huh? Steph, Wade, LeBron, KD are all clearly better than Dwight through his own prime years. Then you got Chris Paul, Westbrook, and Harden as players that are arguably better so like I said he's arguably top 5. He was supposed to be #2. Him and LeBron. No one else. Basically he was supposed to be more like Hakeem, a player that peaked defensively very early and later became an offensive dynamo to lead his team to many rings. In 08 if you told someone Dwight's next 3 years will include 3 DPOYs, a Finals appearance on a 59 win team, a conference Finals appearance vs Boston on a 59 win team, and an MVP runner up no one would be surprised and it was expected he'd keep growing from there (he was only 25 in 2011)."
"Centers do not need a jumpshot. He is a small ball 5. Maybe one day they realize that, trade Lopez and divizenzo and get themselves an actual PG (with Jrue and Middleton in #2 and #3 respectively).  They lack in the ball handling/ playmaking department. Their half court sets are broken and they can only (reliably) score off the transition or by Giannis abusing suspect post defenses.  They literally have no answer to legit post defense. None, zero, zilch and it is quite the head scratcher that they have yet to fix that (by acquiring legit pick n roll threats), by having a pure PG to facilitate cuts.  Obviously Jrue is an upgrade over Bledsoe, but still not a pure PG. Of course pure PGs are not found in the flea market, but basically that is where they stand. They need a Chris Paul like player , 5 years younger than Chris Paul.  To their credit they try some things to bring variety to their offense, things they would not try in the past, but simply tis not enough."
"I can only name one player I would have taken over Dwight in the next 3 drafts after his. And that is Chris Paul. I would also argue Dwight had a higher peak than Paul even if his downslide came earlier. These drafts included  LaMarcus Aldridge Chris Paul Brandon Roy Rajon Rondo  I'll even cheat and go one year ahead even tho you never defined what an ""era"" even meant. KD is thr first player in 4 drafts I easily go ""yeah I'd take him over Dwight easy"". I hate to say you're talking out your ass but it kind of seems like you are."
It's kinda like Chris Paul but the difference is Chris Paul actively fucks with the refs  Draymond just fucks with everyone regardless of who they are  I wonder who actually has the longest leash would be interesting to see maybe luka? Or trae Or harden (someone's whos game play is very much dictated by getting to the free throw line
i agree. I also think it helps last year that he played a lot with Chris Paul. Thunder played often with a two guard line up.
The rockets have been mediocre since the inception of time what is your point. They lacked any semblance of coaching ability so just said “here James go.” And lucked into a WCFs one time? With someone to run the system finally in Chris Paul?
"No that’s pretty idiotic, a lot of strategy goes into fouling, an example: if you have fouls to give and you’re pg winds up in really bad switch down low (think of like Kyle Lowry or Chris Paul getting stuck on the low block against ad who’s frantically calling for an entry pass) they can foul before the shot and the big doesn’t get a chance to shoot and the team has to inbound to start the possession again. In your scenario regardless of the foul being before the shot attempt takes place as could just go up and dunk it after being hacked and get a super easy and one"
Kawhi and Harden are probably the most notable players you didn't list. Chris Paul is still one of the best halfcourt players in the league. Embiid is also force in the halfcourt with his posting up.
"Chris Paul/Iguodala, JJ Reddick/Carmelo Anthony,  Lebron/Trever Ariza, Paul Milsap/PJ Tucker, Marc Gasol/Haslem. Honestly still a title contender cause of Lebron and CP3. But there bodies would give up on them second roundish due to the insane workload at the old age."
"You look at a 6'3"" 200+ pound professionally athlete and think he he looks a bit like you? lol Why are you pretending Curry is Chris Paul/IT/Nate Robinson size?"
"Would Chris Paul be the perfect player for this current Pels team? Imagine him in place of Ball, with Lonzo off the bench."
"[Here a photo of him standing next to Chris Paul (and other OKC players)](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/steven-adams-terrance-ferguson-dennis-schroder-chris-paul-danilo-picture-id1172916484)  I think Schroder is 6', he looks about the same height as CP3 give or take 1-2cm?"
"Im not speaking literally dude. LeBrons role with the Lakers is not as different from previous coaches as you make it sound. To me it isnt as much him playing more 1 or 2, rather the Lakers playing multiple forwards in the same lineup. You wouldn't say Chris Paul played way more SF last year because they played 3 gaurd line ups.   The point is that positions dont matter. You can play 3 point guards or 2 Centers or 4 Forwards. It isnt as simple as 1-5."
Now they're saying *I'm* the new Chris Paul.
Chris Paul is becoming a great actor. I would watch him on a TV show or movie. I LOVE his commercials. Really makes me want to get state farm.
"Probably not unless Ayton and Booker take a jump. Chris Paul is far too old to lead this team anywhere. I dont even know if they are good enough to win if we took out the top 3 talented  teams. (Lakers, Clippers, Nets)."
"Yes, behind the help of Finals MVP Jevon Carter, DPOY Mikal Bridges, 6MOY Cam Johnson, and Backup Point Guard Chris Paul, anything's possible"
"So Allen Iverson, Steve Nash, John Stockton, Charles Barkley, Karl malone, Chris Paul, Patrick Ewing, Elgin Baylor are all scrubs? Wow nice take bro"
Alright here's a list of guys from mid-majors that had at least decent careers.   Chris Kaman Central Michigan  Kevin Martin Western Carolina  Danny Granger New Mexico  Patrick Bryant Bradley  Paul Milsap Louisiana Tech  Rodney Stuckey Eastern Washington  Jason Smith Colorado State  Jason Thompson Rider University  Courtney Lee Western Kentucky  George Hill IUPUI  Steph Curry Davidson  Gordon Hayward Butler  Paul George Fresno State  Larry Sanders VCU  Jimmer Fredette BYU  Kawhi Leonard San Diego State  Kenneth Faried Morehead State  Norris Cole Cleveland State  Shelvin Mack Butler  Damian Lillard Weber State  Kyle O'Quinn Norfolk State  CJ McCollum Lehigh  Isaiah Canaan Murray State  James Ennis Cal State Long Beach  Cam Payne Murray State  Larry Nance Jr Wyoming  Richaun Holmes Bowling Green  Ja Morant Murray State  Obi Toppin Dayton
Chris Paul is nowhere near the best point guard of all time
"LeBron won in Miami too. If the MVP is on a stacked team, the MVP is on a stacked team.  Its not some ""Chris Paul achievement in being a better team than expected but not really great"" award"
"He's v clutch in the sense I completely believe a last second shot of his would go in. However, like 5 minutes in a close game, he sometimes forces it, leading to a lot of bad shots and turnovers. Luckily for us, we have Mr. Chris Paul who's arguably the best crunch time decision maker and Book as our last possession shot maker."
"Also, Booker is playing a ton more in the half court versus a bunch of transition work in years' past. Obviously, when you have Chris Paul on your team, this is what happens, Book will adjust"
"I mean... BI, redick, naw, hart, etc. I'm not saying it's all nba ball here, I'm just saying as a tactic that coulda gotten the most out of what these guys can do.  If stan van's plan was for lonzo to be chris paul, just seems kinda like he's missing the point of his pieces."
Yeah because chris Paul got hurt
"I actually prefer the baseline double behind the back that dropped Chris Paul before draining the midrange.  It's the perfect mirror to IMO the best move ever, which was the Jordan fake pull out, drive baseline and dunk all over Ewing.  [Curry](https://youtu.be/S0c_VnwomOU)  [Jordan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXrdy37zSV8)"
He honestly has been better than Chris Paul so far
Idk Chris Paul made it to the play offs with a decimated thunder team with shai and galinari as his best players.
Yeah i agree with your Flynn take. I don't hate his defense tbh... watching him clamp Chris Paul was probably the highlight of his season so far
"I think not being able to hold leads and put teams away is a very valid criticism. Just off the top of my head, this is the third time this season we have let a team sneak back into the game late. We didn’t trade for Chris Paul to be a little better than last year, we got him to win and compete in the playoffs."
2018 rockets must have had the best group of role players ever assembled. 3 wing defenders who were all switchable 1-4 plus chris paul who was still a top tier defender. Couldve been even more if luc was healthy too. Good thing dray was able to counter capela's presence pretty well
"Yeah, Chris Paul and Tony Parker were always getting it LOL"
Chris Paul bro
How well do y’all think they’d do with someone like Chris Paul?
"I mean this is still frustrating to watch and Colin has been developing really well but shit like this would happen all the time. Chris Paul is on Kevin love. Give him the ball, fuck whatever play you’re trying to run.   He’s getting better every year but watching Colin run the 1 when he was thrust into it was tough to watch tbh"
"Not even Chris Paul is getting calls now he is on the suns, he is not the flopper he used to be because he won't get the calls."
"In that case, it's chris paul by 2 months"
Suns fans how's Chris Paul been looking? Haven't gotten much of a chance to watch Phoenix this year.
"Chris Paul can act, just replace milquetoast ass Jake from State Farm with him"
I meant to say he still performed like a top 7 player in 2018. Ofc absolute peak Chris Paul is a top 3 player.
"I can't speak to whatever it is you dislike about Hodge (and I can only guess you're referring to the dustup he had in Australia a while back), but  [it's not an isolated incident with Chris Paul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3a-uuxbgGg), unless you believe all these other guys were saying something to him as well and they're all jerks and they all deserved it somehow."
They won all of those games because they had a great roster.  2018 Chris Paul was not a superstar. Stop
"I mean there's not really a hard and fast rule lol; KD and AD have been referred to that enough to know who they are. And it applies to usually the top players since they get talked about so often.  We don't really go by CP but CP3 for Chris Paul, like PG13 for Paul George."
"I’m not talking about KD and Curry. I actually kind of understand why they weren’t considered when they teamed up.  I specifically was talking about KD and Westbrook. I don’t think Russ was considered a top 5 player in all those years. I’m pretty sure for the majority of those years Chris Paul was still regarded as a better player and I don’t think Russ was better than KD, Harden, Lebron or Steph in any of those years."
Chris Paul does get called CP and CP3
Bullshit—you didn’t watch a young Chris Paul.
Fun Fact: JR smith is younger than Chris Paul
Yes the mighty superstars of 36 year old Chris Paul and “the worst contract in the league” Russel Westbrook.
"The pandemic partying and the way Harden publicly threw our roster under the bus was wrong (even though I personally agree with Harden’s assessment of our roster pre-trade). I also think the way Chris Paul was booted out the city was wrong too. Other than that, he was well within his rights to request a trade after how we went out last season. It was clear the Harden-era Rockets were finished."
Ugh.. I wish Chris Paul had more win luck.  He has been so good for so long despite countless injuries.
"Chris Paul was 34 when he left, not when he joined. Not sure if you follow the rockets, but thought I should let you know"
"2018 Chris Paul certainly was still in his prime, or at least still performed like a top 7 type player. I'm with you for 2019 Paul and 2020 Westbrook."
"Oh yeah 31 year old injured Westbrook, 34 year old Chris Paul and post back injury Dwight. Very comparable situations to the Warriors in their primes."
Except maybe Chris Paul
"Come on. Is depth valuable? Yes. Did that Warriors team have strong depth? For sure. But the Warriors didn't win the title in 2015 with depth. They won it with high end talent and the best back court in the NBA - arguably one of the best backcourts ever. Steph was top 5 in almost every statistical offensive category, the most efficient offensive producer, 6th in points and played alongside a shooting guard who was 10th in PPG that season. The following season Steph won the MVP, led the league in points, and win share.  Here's an exercise, lets swap out the Klay/Steph backcourt in 2015 for Chris Paul and DeMar DeRozan. Are the Warriors winning that championship? No way.  If your focus is to win basketball games, you're better off improving your best 1/2 talent than your 7-10."
"Tiny relative to us commoners, but that amount of difference at the pro level is apparently the difference between having a Chris Paul career and a Meyers Leonard career (I know they don’t play the same position, they’re just two of the allegedly hard working players being discussed here)"
"I got zero love for Chris Paul but I still admit that he's one of the best PG's to ever do it, pains me to say it but if he had even 1 championship he'd probably be considered up there with the likes of Steph as the Magic Johnson runner-ups."
"I totally buy that Ingram is serious about improving and that JJ's praise is legit, honestly think he'll be a perennial all-star.  That being said I gotta point out that as long as JJ has been around, he hasn't really played with guys particularly known for their hardcore commitment or study of the game. In his career the other stars he played with were Dwight, Blake Griffin and a young Joel Embiid/Ben Simmons, so when he says Ingram watches more film than any of his non-Chris Paul teammates it *might* not be such a big deal."
"AD is demonstrably better than Cleveland Kyrie, let’s not try to make that argument. 2016 Lebron was the carry job of the century, Lebron-AD is not a Batman-Robin duo, they’re a 1A-1B.   As if Harden hasn’t had loads of opportunities? Chris Paul, Dwight, Russ? Yeah, obviously he never played with fuckin Lebron, but he went to the WCF what, twice? Once? The Harden Rockets were a failed experiment."
David Thompson &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Chris Paul
I was so sure Curry was born in NC and I was like “how the fuck is he not better than Chris Paul”... then I looked it up 😂 best shooter of all time and he’s not even the strongest player born at his hospital
"INGRAM'S DRIVE AND willingness to be coached date to the days and late nights he spent with his father, Donald, who played growing up and helped run the Martin C. Freeman Recreation Center in Kinston. After hours, Donald Ingram kept the center open for Ingram and his friends.  Ingram's father viewed his son's game as representing both his family and the rec center. ""He wasn't gonna be a sorry player, or an unskilled player,"" Donald Ingram said. ""I saw a lot of players caught up in fancy dribbling and 'AND1' basketball. I wasn't having that.""  They spent evenings working on dribbling and passing, sometimes using Brandon Ingram's friends as defenders and cutters. Ingram never asked for a day off.  Perhaps Ingram internalized the example of two working parents. For 23 years, Donald Ingram awoke before 4 a.m. to arrive early at the Crown Equipment Corporation forklift plant in Kinston. He got home shortly after 3 p.m., dozed in his recliner, and opened the rec center at 5 p.m. -- where he remained until at least 9 p.m. Editor's Picks      Lowe: Answering the massive questions driving this James Harden trade     Lowe's 10 things: Awesome Lakers, Zion boards and Dort (!)  At the rec center, Brandon Ingram played against men who tried to bully the skinny kid. On defense, Donald would rest his forearm on Ingram's waist, preventing him from moving forward. He demanded his son push back. ""Don't let nobody guide you with the ball!""  Donald Ingram played in various leagues against a younger Jerry Stackhouse, who became Brandon Ingram's AAU coach in Kinston and one of his mentors. During a gathering at Stackhouse's mother's home, Stackhouse challenged Ingram -- then around 12 or 13 -- to one-on-one. When Ingram got the ball, Stackhouse grabbed his off arm with both hands. ""You're not gonna let me hold you, are you?"" he asked. Ten seconds passed, maybe 20. ""Get my damn hands off you!"" Finally Ingram wrenched them off.  In Stackhouse's memory, they did not play one-on-one again until Ingram's senior year. ""He really came at me,"" Stackhouse said, ""and I knew he was ready.""  ""I don't think he wanted anymore smoke after that,"" Ingram said.  As Ingram's star rose at Kinston and on the AAU circuit, teammates and coaches admired how unselfish he remained.  ""He always made the right play,"" said Darnell Dunn, Ingram's teammate at Kinston and on Stackhouse's AAU team.  ""Everyone knew how talented he was,"" Stackhouse said. ""They were happy to say, 'You do you.' But he ain't the 'do you' type. He would hit the open man and know the ball might come back to him.""  The Pelicans have noticed more of that this season. Ingram is making simple plays to keep the offense moving. When defenses trap him, he slips the ball to Steven Adams:  When defenses ignore New Orleans' shaky shooters, Ingram kicks them the ball, confident they will exploit open space. Sometimes, the ball comes back to him -- just as it did in AAU:  ""He's making the right play, and that gets to be contagious,"" Van Gundy said.  In past seasons, Ingram would sometimes either miss simple passes or decline them. He often requested the Pelicans video crew send him compilations of passes he should have made but didn't.  ""The guy watches more film than any player I've been around except maybe Chris Paul,"" Redick said.  He might spot himself settling for midrangers or picking up his dribble when one more bounce would have unlocked something better -- a drop-off to Williamson, or a crosscourt pass for a corner 3.  The dilemma for New Orleans is that Ingram is both their best creator and the best shooter in their starting five. That means the Pelicans sometimes use him as a floor-spacer. It also means many Ingram kickouts go to below-average 3-point shooters.  ""It's my responsibility to have guys out there that can finish those plays,"" Van Gundy said.  If anything, there are possessions where it might be better for Ingram to force it. He has mostly demurred. ""I like his balance so far,"" Van Gundy said. ""You don't want someone who is just looking to pass, but you also don't want a pig.""  Ingram has become a more confident and polished finisher around the basket -- a prolific producer of free throws. Something clicked in the 2018-19 season, his rumor-filled final year with the Lakers, and the development accelerated in New Orleans. Ingram mastered his footwork -- when to use choppy steps in tight creases, and when to gobble up space with loping strides. He finally seemed to understand how long his arms are -- that he was on top of the rim sooner than he had perceived."
"Chris Paul?  Really?  Does the name ""David Thompson"" ring any bells?  Since drugs wrecked his NBA career he's possibly a ""what might have been"" so far as that goes but he was Jordan before Jordan in the 70s.  (Full disclosure:  I admit to a degree of bias against Paul in general because of what that nut-punching jerk did to Julius Hodge in a college game years ago...)"
"while true, he wasn't doing it damn near every time he walked up court. at a certain point, like the rip through, and when Chris Paul was doing this, you end up having to make a decision and not just give it to him every time."
but he achieved 25/5/8 without Chris Paul.
"At this point, it is pretty clear that Giannis is a center with special attributes. That also makes the Bucks not trading for Chris Paul an even bigger crime. Paul is a better player than Jrue, an elite pick and roll guy, and would have given them more financial flexibility."
I’ll just go with my favorite players by position.  Chris Paul Vince Carter Tracy McGrady Kevin Garnett Marc Gasol 6th man Larry Bird (cause why not).
"Both Marc and Serge tossed up an annoying number of I-dare-you 3s and contested midrange shots. Maybe they were too creaky to want to get in the paint on offense. Boucher's shot selection plays to his strengths, so he's getting a lot of dunks on cuts and rolls, and has been absolutely drilling open 3s. He knows better than to drive into a crowd, or dink around playing iso ball like he's a 6'9 Chris Paul. Keeps his game simple, exploits seams in the defense, and gets to the rim and the stripe way better than anyone would expect. His stats are off the chart, and I don't think they're sustainable, but he's a big reason the raps are winning, or at least getting close"

"If only you guys went for Chris Paul, him next to those two superstar prospects would be fun to watch."
"I'm sure clippers fans are pretty happy that they made the right decision instead of sitting too long on that fat ass contract. They traded blake while they felt they could get a good haul and turned it into paul george and Kawhi leonard.   The clippers realized that he couldn't do it with an all time great like Chris Paul, then he's probably not doing it with anyone else either. Cold and calculated, but fair. Blake got paid money that will last for life. And besides, who's to say he wouldn't have soured on the clippers asap after realizing that they weren't going to win and he was getting older. We just watched Harden do it to Houston."
"To be fair, he was only ever good with Chris Paul.  Other than dunk titles, the mans been washed since he came out of college.  Shouldn't be news."
Have you ever watched Chambers play? He wasn’t a great iso scorer got a lot of transition points and set up by KJ.  Again if Thomas took so many bailout shots that it had a noticeable effect on the team and his efficiency the Pistons were doing something terribly wrong. No team from that era that I’ve watched had to do that.   Of course Zeke was the best player. But you but Chris Paul or any other great point guard there they win the title.
Unless your Chris Paul who is literally a Point God
LAPD? This is Blake Griffin! Chris Paul is tryina beat me up!
"This doesn't change Chris Paul being hurt and not being available for his team...  Again current rules and style of play have also made it so that ball handlers are far more impactful now compared to Zeke's era. These new advanced stats also weigh factors that have been more impactful in the past 20 years and not for that era.   If the guy who made PIPM made it pre-1997 and they had plus minus stats, the methodology would've been different. Because the game has changed."
Dan and tony ran that with Chris Paul. He would start but still lead the bench with Harden sitting. He could do the same thing with BKN. We all know he’s the coach in the shadows for them. It works out because Harden and Kyrie don’t have to worry about passing to each other and ignoring each other or Durant. Harden can pass to Durant or score himself and Kyrie can solve the bench problem by orchestrating their offense. Win/win and it worked with HOU
"He did elevate those teams but not to the extent all-time playmakers did.  We do have PIPM and RAPTOR from back then, it’s estimated but still does a decent job  Chris Paul  PIPM 3 Year Peak: 7.5  RAPTOR 3 Year Peak: 10.5  Isiah Thomas  PIPM 3 Year Peak: 4.3  RAPTOR 3 Year Peak: 6"
"I'm guessing I'm one of the few folks here who's probably watched more Isiah Thomas games than I have Chris Paul. Doesn't make me an authority on the topic, of course, but here's some of my thoughts nonetheless.   I don't think you could go wrong with either guy. Like, if you could flash back to 1981 and enter both Isiah *and* Chris Paul into that draft, I'm not sure any team's walking away bummed if they had to settle for one over the other.   Like any cross-generational debate, things will get mucky when accounting for changes of how the game's played. Isiah played his entire amateur career *without* a 3-point line, for instance, so really quickly things can devolve into ""But Isiah can't shoot threes"" and ""But Chris couldn't handle the physicality""... those same old tropes.   The best bet, in my opinion, is probably to compare them according to how they performed within their particular eras. And they're both amazing. Those championship Pistons teams were specifically built to withstand an injury or loss of any given player, but it was Thomas who was there to build them from the ground up from '81 on forward. And Chris Paul may have never reached the top but I have little doubt that many believe he wasn't capable on the right team.   Personally? I'm insanely biased. Isiah's playoff intangibles - those moments where he could follow up a bad game not just with a dose of redemption, but with one of the greatest individual performances in modern playoff history, make it hard to ever bet against him. [There's over a dozen moments/games right off hand that could stand as the postseason highlight of many player's careers.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWv5aFyC0z2sBA6IuqUbCPbpDAyidJUHY)  But having said that, if someone took away Isiah from those '89 and '90 teams and was like, ""You can't have him, too bad, deal with it. You'll have to settle for Chris Paul instead"", I'm probably not losing any sleep.   **TL;DR** They're both amazing players, so flip a coin."
&gt; Nash or Paul   This is a tough one. Paul vs. Thomas is comparing eras so I'm out on that.  My question is: If you give Nash the super green light does he whoop on everybody?   Another question: Is this injury-free Chris Paul? Prime CP3 was quick like Iverson.
"If he sat out and didn't play thru those injuries as much (like Chris Paul), his teams never win their series.   Just like how a short career is a part of Zeke's legacy, injuries is a part of Chris Pauls."
"I think Isiah sometimes had shot selection issues in his prime. For instance, at times, you'd see him go into takeover mode and attempt an out of control double pump layup that had a relatively low success rate.   However, I find that to be a lot different than flat out stating he wasn't a good shooter. For his era, where only a select few players utilized and consistently hit the 3-point shot (designated sharpshooters), Thomas could be an outstanding shooter in many respects for that time. [His mid-range, (which was utilized like players utilize threes today), was particularly cold-blooded.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM3AV1xLyEQ&amp;ab_channel=RyanVanDusen) Also worth noting that when he started repping threes more consistently, he had his moments there too (at one point he may have held the record for highest 3-point percentage in a Finals series).   As it happens, Chris Paul is a killer from mid-range too (at least he was, I haven't seen his play a ton in recent years) so that's not to say that Paul isn't a better shooter. I just think folks miss some context when they notice that Thomas shot 27 percent from three on 1.5 attempts per game."
"Chris Paul missed those games and that's why it's a knock on him. Not fair because it's injuries but those injuries are a part of his legacy...  Just telling you why Tomas had ""bad"" series compared to Chris Paul. He was their AI/Kobe shot taker and it was a tougher era for ball handlers."
"I haven't been thrilled with Chris Paul, but I'm definitely not upset with losing Oubre in that deal."
"Looks like you put a lot of thought and research into it, but I have some differing opinions. Magic too low at 7. Curry too high at 13, the big O was much the better player. Chris Paul at 27 and two spots ahead of Isiah is a travesty. Paul criminally overrated and Thomas won two titles during one of the NBAs golden periods. Dwight Howard is not in my top 100 neither is Draymond or Lowry. I love the fact that you put this out there. Thanks for saving."
&gt;Chris Paul is such a B....  I seen worse
Chris Paul has missed his last 6 shots lol
"the exact line on Harden, meanwhile he made Westbrook look incredible and the addition of chris paul turned the rockets into perhaps the best team to never make the finals. there's precedent for extremely high usage rate players benefitting from something like this."
Chris Paul is so much more likeable since he left the Clippers.  So are Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan.  Just how much of an asshole is Doc Rivers?
Chris Paul is one of the few guys in the analytics era with the craziest shot difficulty with good efficiency
Chris Paul is such a B....
Chris Paul hasnt been that good Book hasn’t been that good Ayton hasn’t been that good  And they are only 8-8. I think there’s room to grow
What's Chris Paul doing?
Chris Paul is not top 15.
Chris Paul nailing midrange shots will never get old. Top-15 player in NBA history easily.
"Because of Chris Paul killing the team idendity on offense and adding nothing on defense, And also Monty Williams"
ayton is washed and chris paul is a bust
"Lmao Chris Paul at the age of 35 and well past his prime, finished as high in MVP voting as Stockton ever did in his prime. That tells you all you need to know. In fact you could easily make the argument that Chris Paul last year is close to as good as Stockton was at his peak."
"If you polled those same 100 experts I would guess few would consider Ingles a wing stopper. Having a nice series against George a few years ago, I think George was injured too, doesn’t really do it. Murray is a guard, but Ingles looked much too slow against him last year whereas he was a primary guy on Chris Paul with the Clippers that last year Paul was there. The Jazz don’t even consider him their best perimeter guy, that’s Royce O’Neale."
"Unfortunately just played in an incredibly stacked West.  Chris Paul, Dame, Steph, Klay, Kobe, Harden.  Conley is definitely an amazing player who should be a multi-time All Star but just a victim of circumstance."
He almost had Chris Paul when he was the best PG 😳
Also the Chris Paul fans vs the guys that want Rubio back
"Jokic should prolly start based on how this season has gone so far.  East prolly has the better starters, but West would be deeper. West has PG, AD, Mitchell, Gobert, potentially Chris Paul coming off the bench"
"Not exposed, but they did overachieved last season. It was a mistake on Riley to think that they can pull it off again with basically the same roster, even losing Crowder was a downgrade, he was a better fit than Bradley. They should've gave up Herro and Olynyk for Harden or Chris Paul if they wanted to return to the Finals. A Chris Paul and Buttler duo is actually kinda scary."
"This “I know because I played high school ball” take is almost always bad. Yes, Westbrook cares about his stats. The Thunder liked him having the ball, but having that statistical season wasn’t just a byproduct of that. 10 rebounds wasn’t just because they wanted him to grab and go. That’s not something that should be controversial. It can be beneficial to some extent and still be a form of stat chasing.   I don’t know about the Chris Paul dirty take, but hopefully you aren’t saying players are totally fine with the antics of guys like Paul. There are obviously players who think stopping in front of someone in transition is bullshit. We just had Nash make a comment about “playing the game the right way” while complaining about Trae Young. You can call that hypocritical but this idea that it’s a non-basketball playing take is so ridiculous. Or maybe Nash got cut from his JV team."
"He's weird, the flashes are there but he just isnt assertive frequently enough. The stats on the surface look ok but he's just high variance game to game he has like 4 games with at least 24 points and like 5 or 6 in single digits.   Still doesnt have that much of a 1 v1 game just dependent on fadeaway jumpers and cant really pass. Gotten a little better with it this year but he should still get to the free throw line more than he does for someone with his tools. It's weird, outside of putbacks the only way he can really do anything on offense is when Chris Paul passes him the ball. There's just no chemistry with anybody else like Jae Crowder has thrown him more passes this year than Devin Booker."
Imo that Chris Paul pick feels like a legacy one
"Tbh I don't see the point of voting in locks like LeBron, Giannis, Steph etc since they are assured spots whether I vote for them or not.   Mine are -   East:  Jaylen Brown  Brad Beal  Tobias Harris  Domantas Sabonis  Jerami Grant   West:  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Chris Paul  Brandon Ingram  Paul George  Andrew Wiggins"
Lol come on dog. Lowry being 6ft has nothing to do with the team. Lowry is easily the most important piece and even though he's undersized he doesn't get smoked on defense constantly.  A 6' PG is legit the last item on the list of shit the raptors need to fix.   I don't see why height matters at all. Chris Paul is 6'1 and like Lowry he produces a greater positive than negative based from their height.
"Chris Paul. Flopping, nut punching, being a dick to teammates, being a dick to coaches, being a dick to refs, and drawing bullshit fouls by stopping right in front of players to draw a foul. Great player, what a douche"
Chris paul would like a word
"Chris Paul, he just doesn't win too often in the playoffs so you don't notice as much"
"I don't think there's a minimum, it just seems, the way ppg is looked at, the higher that is the less other stuff you have to do.  Like someone can be a superstar at 27 ppg with 4 rpg, 3 apg, a block and a steal per game but 18 ppg with those other stats? No. The lower your ppg is the more other stuff you have to do.  Take Chris Paul. Only had ppg over 20 twice, last time in 08-09, but prime Paul was certainly a superstar."
Steve Nash and Chris Paul. Must see TV.
"help me, chris paul trying to come in here and beat me up!"
Can’t wait for the suns and nets to play for when Chris Paul grabs Harden’s man boobs
"Chris Paul happened, also Crowder chucking a lot of 3s."
"Chris Paul, Pat Bev"
"Ok Takeaways:  OKC YESSIRSKI ✅ WE DO NOT LOSE FOLKS DONT FUCKING FORGET IT  That was like watching last years team scrimmage at 100% and CP3 is so good he has the play against all the young guys and Al horford for it to be fair  Abdel Nader - the return, the revenge  Jae crowder is so solid bro  Dort is actually so fucking good pay attention to the man  me telling the refs to T up Chris paul   Poku got some nice run. This is how we make him into the 7 foot sniper guard he will inevitably become ¯_(ツ)_/¯  Diallo is waaaay too tough  Flacko Roby SZN  CP3 is probably so furious rn hahaha  Awesome Shai  Good work OKC. Let’s keep competing"
I think this is actually the most points Chris Paul has scored in a game in 3 years.
Chris Paul.  Fuck the Chris Paul.
Chris Paul would give a two piece and a biscuit special.
"The Thunder got *very* lucky. They had the Clippers over a barrel. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is a player no sane team would have given up (you just don't give up young players Jerry West is high on), and Chris Paul went Veteran Mentor.  Generally speaking, smaller-market teams *can't afford* to risk blowing it up, especially if that would require offloading a beloved fan-favourite star who doesn't actively want to go."
"There are certain takes in every sports subreddit that out the majority of users as people who’ve never competed athletically even at like a high school or aau level across any sport. The ones for this subreddit all revolve around sportsmanship and “playing the game the right way” .  “Westbrook is a stat chaser and a horrible teammate” and “Chris Paul is heinously dirty” are the two that pop the most to me. If you played any team sports you either had that teammate or you were that teammate, or you played against dudes like that. They’re just terrible takes from people who haven’t really competed."
Wheres Phoenix and Chris Paul?
Right. Chris Paul and Draymond are a couple others.  Just noting that LeBron's remarkable ability to increase both his per/100 and efficiency stats over his past 3 postseasons is not something he's done throughout his career.
"Devin Booker possibly, or does Chris Paul negate that?"
LeBron as Sting  Curry/Klay as the Young Bucks  Kawhi as Orange Cassidy  Luka as Darby Allin  Chris Paul as Cody Rhodes   Anthony Davis as Kenny Omega  Gordon Hayward as Chris Jericho  Westbrook as Jon Moxley
"Underrated: John Wall, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeMarcus Cousins, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Paul Millsap, Al Horford and Derrick Rose, especially if they missed out on pre-injury Rose  Russell Westbrook is so polarizing that he will remain stuck on a pendulum.  While I generally like Kyrie Irving, I think he has been and will remain overrated, despite being a very good player.   He's flashy and efficient, which works to his benefit, along with his undeniably, spectacular peformance in the 2016 Finals. As a star player though, he's produced a very little amount of sustained team success as a leader, away from three surefire Hall of Famers, one of which is considered the GOAT for a whole generation of fans (and, all three are among the greatest scorers/offensive talents the league has ever seen).  That's not really Kyrie's fault, but I don't think people in the future who didn't see will consider that aspect all that much."
"Even JJ redick is still playing, kobe retired at 38, wade retired at 38, jamal crawford was still playing at 39, joe johnson was playing at 38, ray allen 39, iguodala still playing, chris paul looks like he will play past 36"
"Kobe's last three years didn't need to be that way, though. Just like Westbrook's play doesn't need to be what it is now. It's hard to do, but players can adjust their game to fit a new role and still be a productive NBA player. Vince Carter did it. Ray Allen did it. Rudy Gay, Andre Iguodala, Chris Paul, etc."
"His true shooting percentage is 1% below league average.    &gt;Some of the PGs with worse efficiency this season: Lillard, Steph Curry, Brogdon, Murray, Wall, Chris Paul, Rose, Walker, Schroeder, Lowry ... so, wtf ?  This is incredibly misleading as almost all these are accurate from 3 and better free throw shooters. Steph and dame for example are both more than 6% higher in true shooting precentage."
"That athleticism is what made him an elite player. Now he's lost that, and you're throwing out an assist stat that really doesn't make up for his decline. He can still contribute, with assists, sure, but he isn't a Chris Paul or Rajon Rondo. He needs to contribute in other areas and he isn't yet. There is hope and this is a weird season esp in DC.   I was going to buy season tickets to watch him, and right now, that looks like a bad plan. Post-vaccine, I might anyway, just because I finally can."

"Great, now that there's precedent someone is gonna do this on purpose to take a top player out of the game in crunch time.  ...probably Chris Paul"
"&gt;He had to come out at the climax?  wait, you think booker would have made a difference last game in the last 30 seconds? He wouldn't have done anything to block the jumper from Murray simply because mid-range jumpers aren't really defensible shots (but booker is also a pretty poor defender). He might have made a difference in the very last play but teams with only one possession left while down 3 have very low chances of winning the game, especially when there is still enough time on the clock for the other team to potentially make a play themselves (which the nuggets had time for, the timer on the last play was ~20 seconds). With booker's shooting efficiency I doubt he would have much of an impact there, but yeah if he did that would be hype af so it sucks we didn't get to see anything.   &gt;I’m salty bc y’all got gifted bullshit calls and acting like y’all better.  I'm not better. I just watch basketball. The nuggets are a better team than the suns though. I remember when a bunch of ppl were saying the same shit about the lakers though when the nuggets played em in the playoffs LOL. Suns have the same problem nuggets had (still kinda have) of not knowing how to play defense without fouling the shit out of people. That's what happens with young rosters all the time. Chris Paul will prob help them get out of that habit."
Head coach Chris Paul wont be able to be on the sidelines for the second half of game 7 after getting ejected for the 4th time in the series for yelling at the refs.
"Chris Paul is in fact, president of the national basketball players association. He is indeed, not Bernie Sanders.  Glad we came to an understanding."
Chris Paul would be like 42 so no
Chris Paul I'm pretty sure
"Chris Paul shooting 2.6 free throws per game, I'm not sure you have any idea what you're talking about."
We need a backup center so bad. Also we are are even worse than last season at closing games even Chris Paul.
New Orleans has to be up there too. They couldn’t create a legitimate contender with Chris Paul or AD and time will tell if they do the same with Zion.
"Remember the time a female ref pissed off Chris Paul so much he said ""this might not be for her""? lmao"
never forget chris paul is clutch
Chris Paul has been picking on jokic ever since he came into the league lmao his pnr d is so bad
He did the Chris Paul fake bounce pass. Got Gobert to hesitate.
Harden play like 35 years old Chris Paul with more turnovers. Holy shit man even CP shoots more shots than him. Healthy rockets with Wood and Wall + Harden are definitely better than this current Nets team of KD Harden and Irving.
So uhhh 26 first half assists for Chris Paul the last two nights?  Just don’t go 1 assist 4 TO in the second half again maybe
2 points with 11 assists and a +12 by the 2nd quarter such a Chris Paul stat line this year.
Yeah they always call this on the defender. Its a classic chris paul move...they must have made an emphasis on cracking down on it
We were honestly robbed of being able to see mvp curry lebron kawhi PG Chris Paul KD Klay and more all in the olympics at once. I could imagine what that 2016 team could have done especially with deandre and such in the paint omg we’d have scored 400 on every team
"As a suns fan, it’s too bad we couldn’t keep him around. He was good last year, but not super consistent. When your team has an opportunity to trade for Chris Paul, well..."
"Lol no. He had Chris Paul against KD, steph, dray and klay. He still only lost game 7 by 9 points without his only star, and harden still had a decent game. You completely ignore how Chris Paul didn’t play. Giannis was the 1st seed against a much less talented 5th seeded miami and got fucking swept. Don’t compare the two."
Chris Paul back in LA used to disguise his lobs as jumpers and it used to blow my mind every time
How is Jokic a level lower than Embiid? That doesn't make any sense. Was Steph Curry a level lower than Chris Paul from 15-17?
"The first year of D’Antoni Harden was dishing like crazy. Tons of ball/player movement. Eventually Harden got his way and became watch him dribble the clock out and jack up step back 3’s. Chris Paul comes in and actually brings chemistry and accountability(resulting in the best shot in Harden’s run). But again Harden’s ego runs him off, forcing a trade for Westbrook, who also couldn’t stand playing with Harden’s complete lack of professionalism and accountability. This dude ran this franchise into the ground then left. Screw Harden."
"VC was not playing like the best player in the league even in his best season of 2000-01. He only made two All NBA teams, one second and one third. That's not just as a Raptor, that is his entire career. The exact same as DeMar DeRozan actually, who has one second and one third as well. He was clearly behind Allen Iverson who won MVP in VCs best season, Shaq, Tim Duncan, Chris Webber, Tracy McGrady, Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, and Kobe, and in a tier with players like Ray Allen and Jason Kidd.  We overrate Vince Carter actual ability on the court. He was a superstar not in play, seeing as he was clearly a step behind the actual best players in the league, but was in ability to bring in fans. He was a great player"
"Before this game: “Chris Paul has been a little over-deferential this year, he should shoot more”  During the game: “no not like that”"
"Chris Paul should be expected to call a timeout there. It's not like he's a rookie scrub. You should know before they even shoot if you have a timeout left.   It was a mistake, but it could be super easy to mess up in the heat of the moment like you mentioned."
Yeah.  Isn’t it odd how Bookers stats lowered with the addition of Chris Paul?  It’s so bizarre.  It was also weird how Dwyane Wades stats lowered when Lebron James showed up in Miami.  I’m not a Qanon specialist but someone needs to look into this conspiracy.
"There's a few things going on here, 1 he doesn't have a HOF pg in Chris Paul. Injuries have taken their toll and lastly, its Detroit... he's collecting his money and probly trying to save his body"
Am I the only one who watches games like this where some player has crazy stats after the first quarter/half and you think „I’m going to witness history!”? Just for the Chris Paul to add 1 more assist to the 14 he had in the first half.
If you adjust scoring per 100 possessions (which is a better measure to account for pace) Booker is averaging slightly more points.   Suns are playing at a slow place (way slower than previous season) and Booker is having trouble adjusting to Chris Paul.  That is not to take away from Randle who is having a great start of the season.
This play is exactly what I had in mind once I heard about Chris Paul trade to the suns.
Hey does anyone know how many assists Chris Paul had in the first half? This seems like a good place to ask.
He seems like a great finisher and mid range shooter. Seems like a dollar store Chris Paul literally
"Flamed out in his career? Chris Paul is a future hall of famer by everyone’s standards. You look either hella dumb or just straight vindictive right now, foh"
That's actually Chris Paul's fault because he took an immediate dribble meaning they would have to take it out in the backcourt instead of advance it. And Chris Paul is able to call a timeout as well so he probably just liked the fast break look he saw
Chris Paul has been so disappoiting this season. By far the worst season of his career the team looks way better when he is not on  the court. Rubio did the same production but with a way better contract.
"Feels more like Chris paul bailed us out, but whatever."
Chris Paul hit his knee too. Hopefully both are nothing.
remember: chris paul or monty williams could have called a timeout for a last play
That midget Chris Paul should have called a timeout in regular time to advance it on a last shot lol that half court yolo... I thought he was the smartest player in the league?
Chris Paul making some terrible mistakes down the stretch. No need to foul there.
fuck a timeout i want chris paul to heave it -monty williams
Chris Paul made a mistake in the clutch??
Death via Chris Paul
Chris Paul is so clutch
Chris Paul playing like Rubio this season. A max contract Rubio but without the great on/off impact Rubio had last season.
I don’t know what it is about the Suns but I genuinely have enjoyed watching Chris Paul for the first time
"Chris Paul is just such a great veteran and player for the suns to have. Especially for the development of Booker, Ayton, and Mikal"
The Nuggets don’t make the playoffs   Chris Finch wins Coach of the Year  Snyder gets fired after Utah underachieves in the playoffs again  Kyle Kuzma makes the All-Star team  Paul George wins MVP

Yeah I didn't realize they outlawed this Chris Paul staple as well
Suns would be contenders if you gave them a playmaker/distributor like Chris Paul.
Chris Paul is being phased out of the league like Roy Hibbert.
YES. TAKE THAT CHRIS PAUL.
Something tells me Chris Paul won’t get over this. That something is the fact that Chris Paul is a bitch.
"Chris Paul, probably."
"“I’d rather give $60m to a 40-yr-old Chris Paul then pay my young centerpiece his very reasonable max deal.”  Well done, Suns."
I swear Chris Paul has already done this a few times in tonights game. No call.
ITT: Chris Paul
"In any game, rules that require establishing intent make the game worse. It's impossible for referees to know what the player is thinking. It's natural for players to stretch rules, and when the rule requires establishing intent, all the players end up doing is ""pretending"" that they didn't mean it.  Now we are arguing about if the call is right or wrong based on what the player meant to do. It's futile.  The part that makes this particular play bad for the game is when Chris Paul does it with 3 mins to go in the quarter while his team is in the bonus. Just make it a no call, and this problem is solved. No need to turn referees into psychologists, just let them call what actually happens."
"Stockton and Mark Jackson and now Chris Paul are the last of a dying breed of pure point guards. The job of the point guard used to be to, in order 1- to run the offense and facilitate others scoring. 2- to play lockdown defense 3- close games with ball security and clutch ft shooting.  Stockton was elite at all of these things. He could’ve scored more, but that wasn’t his job. There’s a reason Malone scored as much as he did. And it’s because he was setup by Stockton.  He was also a hard nosed tenacious defender. A vicious and dirty player who used every bit of guile to kick, punch and claw his way to an advantage without getting caught by the refs.   He was a winner, though not a champion.   We expect our PGs to score now. But we didn’t want that from them back then. Even Zeke was considered more of a combo guard, and the fact that he could turn it on and score was considered an aberration not the job.   I have him in the PG rankings behind— Magic, Cousy, CP, Zeke, Kidd and even with Nash. I consider Steph a combo guard who passes but clearly he’s be ahead of we re counting him as a PG.  Watch games yall. Not to be punny, but Stockton is like basketball jazz, you really have to know what you’re watching to appreciate his brilliance. Not everything is easy to understand. Sometimes doing all of the imperceptible things immaculately adds up to true greatness."
"Give Chris Paul the credit he deserves, hes the best at doing this."
"Chris Paul and Trae Young in shambles, sending letters to the league office about this rule"
"I know he came via a trade, but Chris Paul definitely wanted to go to the Suns and the Thunder worked around his request to make that trade. It was definitely a FA-like move in that the player wanted to join and come to Phoenix."
The Lakers Chris Paul trade was absolute bullshit. He was a fucking ass clown. Booed everywhere.
Chris Paul fouls out by halftime.
Chris Paul in shambles
Chris Paul in shambles
Second best player? They don't even reach past the first round without Chris Paul and Book
Lol my first reaction was oh that’s the Chris Paul move
The New Orleans Hornets also got their #1 pick right after Chris Paul was traded. Bonus points for the NBA needing to sell the franchise and assuming ownership of it at the time.  Yes I will always be salty about the 2012 draft lottery and you can't make me not salty.
"I know, that wasn't the part I had the issue with.  I agree CP3 at 35 is better.  It was bringing up that terrible Bulls loss and then comparing it to Chris Paul who has an even worse loss on his resume.  If you didn't bring up that loss I have no issues with the original intent, it was just ironic to see that used as a criticism in comparison to Chris Paul."
[Woj] Chris Paul has announced his retirement from the NBA effective immediately
Chris Paul going to be crying at the ref all season if he can’t do that
My original comment is literally comparing 35 year old Stockton to 35 year old chris paul
Chris Paul punchin the air rn
That’s the Chris Paul special
"I mean 1, you're comparing 35 year old Stockton to prime Chris Paul in this scenario.  Which isn't really fair.  And 2, that man dropped 4 points.  That's not his team's fault lol."
"I'm not saying I disagree with the sentiment, but I don't think you want to use the ""Stockton lost by 40"" argument when Chris Paul has the worst playoff loss of all time on his resume lol.  At least in Stockton's case it was losing to the GOAT."
"I would just sign them both. They also should have prioritized both over Chris Paul if they were going to end up sacrificing one of these guys, although the right answer is to re-sign CP3 and then extend Bridges and Ayton."
"Chris Paul, Magic, and Steph are all ranked above him imo (not nessecarily in that order) but whose the other 2 that push him outta the top 5?   I'd definitely put Stockton on the back end of top 5 PG all time."
"Whether or not Stockton is better than Chris Paul is not the issue though. I'm not making that case. The question was only about whether Stockton is overrated or underrated.   Having the all time assists and all time steals record, given he played in the lowest scoring era of the last 5 decades is impressive."
98 finals where he averaged 10/9 on 49/22/72 at  age 35.  Chris Paul at age 35 was also just in the finals. He put up 22/8 on 55/52/75.  Theres levels to this
"That’s fair enough. But like, on average. He should be closer to say, Jimmy Butler than Chris Paul"
Chris Paul averages 5 points a game more than Stockton. Does that 5 points really make him “elite”?
"&gt;I've never seen anyone rank him in the top 15-20  The issue is never where people put him in all time rankings, it's where they put him in all time point guard rankings.  People tend to put him over guys who were *definitely* better at their peak (and for longer) or just in general because he has such absurd total stats that look great on paper.  So like, Chris Paul was a borderline MVP.  He's been one of the best point guards in the league for a long time.  But some people will put Stockton over him because of the 2 Finals appearances even though Stockton definitely isn't better individually."
Iverson at 37 and Jokic over Chris Paul lmfao.
"Luka is a difficult player to compare to another.  I would say in today's game he is most similar to Harden, and in past days...hmmmmm...although they play different positions I would probably say Larry Bird.  He definitely has a similar attitude, swag, and that ""Give me the ball, get out of my way, and let me win this thing"" confidence that I love so much in an elite player.   As great as Luka is so far in his career, if he can cut down his turnovers, improve his free throw shooting, and keep improving his 3-point shooting, there is no telling what he will be able to achieve.   At the time he was drafted I felt that he should have been the #1 overall pick.  Because of his age and European experience, combined with Booker, the Suns would have been set at guard for years.  I felt like they could have gotten by another year or two with Tyson Chandler and others at the center position until they could have signed someone.  With Luka there would have been no need to go after Chris Paul.  Could you imagine if they would have taken that Paul money and instead used it to sign someone for less like Vucevic at center?  I also thought the Suns might take him because the Suns coach was Luka's coach in Europe.  I can imagine the coach campaigning for Luka and ownership wanting Ayton with the familiarity/P.R. factor he brought to the organization by playing at Univ. of Arizona.  Tough call.  I thought the influence of the coach could have swung Luka his way.  Not so."
"It's an open question if he's in the top 10? Giannis, KD, Steph, Jokic, Harden, LeBron, Dame, Luka, Embiid, Kawhi, AD, Chris Paul, and Trae, are all pretty safely above him imo. And then there's newer All-Stars like Zion, Tatum, Mitchell, Booker, etc."
"Ah yes Lillard over James Harden, Chris Paul and Dwayne Wade very good"
"So I listened again and here is the question transcribed....  He was asked ""Did you see the growth of jokic and murray to the extent where they are when they first came in the league? Had you seen them before when you scouted?""  West:  ""I didn't see Jokic play at all but my goodness he wasn't even drafted till the second, think how many people slept on him. But he is one of the most gifted big man I have ever seen."" Goes on to compare him to Magic Johnson and Chris Paul.  I think it is pretty clear with the context clues he is referring to before they came into the league."

I hate Chris Paul. But I don't hate him as bad as nancy does. 67?? Sheesh
"I think people overestimate his age because he is probably most memorable for his extremely good defense in the 2018 WCF, particularly switching onto James Harden or Chris Paul or Eric Gordon."
"Love that draymond is ahead of people like Allen iverson, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, Patrick Ewing,Kevin Garnett,Steve nash, Isaiah Thomas, Ray Allen and dirk. Laughable"
"dude if you really dont think a prime 17/15 and 3 steals stockton, shooting 41% from 3 and 61% TS, wouldn't be better than 36 year old chris paul, you're genuinely outrageous. watch some game tape."
"While I agree it’s hard to compare Oscar Robertson to Chris Paul, I think we can all agree claiming Dennis Rodman is the 18th best player in the history of the NBA is moronic"
"I actually agree. I just think saying Booker made it farther, isn’t a good argument for why he’s better. Plus D Mitch got injured, and is the best player on his team, as opposed to Booker who has Chris Paul."
"Book couldn’t even make the playoffs until he got Chris Paul, who is better than him."
"I disagree,  Chris Paul being traded from Rockets -&gt; Thunder -&gt; Pheonix is a prime example of a players value changing drastically in a short period. Carmelo Anthony is another....recency bias is real in the NBA.   Sure, the league knows what Ben is...but as he is  increasingly becoming a public pain in the ass to the 76ers his value will only move in one direction - down.   Non-shooting guards are not what championship teams are looking for at the deadline."
"Thank you for this take, I'm always slightly annoyed by the Suns fans insisting that Ayton was still the better choice for fit, like they couldn't have used their space and assets to get a big instead of Chris Paul."
THE REAL CHRIS PAUL
"You worry about that later. Use the assets for Chris Paul to trade for one. Someone like Capela, I don't know. You don't pass on MVP candidate for Ayton."
"Not current, but that 4 team trade that saw the rockets shipping out Capela and Gerald Green for about half a season of Robert Covington was one of the worst deals I’ve ever seen  I knew it in the moment, I know it now, that deal was just as bad if not worse than the Chris Paul trade (in terms of trade balance, not overall impact)"

"lol Duncan got drafted to perennial second round team as the first pick.  even though they had an injury year, they were still a top 10-15 team in the league.  Imagine adding the #1 pick to that. Of course they were going to win. You can thank RC Buford and the entire spurs organization.  If Kawhi never played the bitch, they would still be contenders till this day.  You give way more credit to Tim Duncan than is actually justified.  By the way, Kobe was able to get Chris Paul, but you know how that turned out. mfin ""basketball reasons""  so yes, he was able to attract a top 20 player, but never got to play with one.  And if Dwight Howard didn't have such a down year in 2013, he'd probably be top 20 as well.  Pau gasol was barely top 20 in the league in 2010, you can see my list below.  Kobe haters are such stupid people honestly."
Chris paul is also sub 6'.
"Lebron James,  Chris Paul,Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose, Dwayne Wade, Deron Williams, Kevin Love, Blake Griffin, Russell Westbrook, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Lamarcus Aldridge, Amare Stoudemire, Dirk Nowitzki,John Wall, Joe Johnson, Zach Randolph, Chris Bosh ,Paul Pierce,Steve Nash  There are 23 players here.  Pau Gasol BARELY fits into this list.  Reddit is way too biased on Tim Duncan for what i think are reasons external to the game of basketball.  And I'm fine with that, but you're absolutely wrong if you think Tim Duncan would survive on any other team not Spurs.  Spurs and Duncan is the GOAT match when it came to player + organization. No other organization + player combo will top those two. Curry + GSW comes at #2."
"Chris Paul isn't a center in the NBA right now, and he wasn't a wing in 2006"
"&gt;I do believe the Blazers had plenty of opportunities to trade away some pieces, mainly CJ and/or Nurk, to have a better chance to win. This kind of speaks to my point of the not really trying. They’ve been sending out this same core for the past 6 years and they have not changed much as a team. They’ve had the same problem for a while and everyone knew their weaknesses which was wing depth and terrible guard defense.   Like what? They tried trading for Paul George and it didn’t go through, and they couldn’t compete for harden last year. Also they tried trading for jimmy butler on 2018 but that didn’t work out either. What other Star players have been traded in the last few years? Chris Paul or Jute holiday, we’ll that’s just puts us in the same position as before. There really haven’t been that many moves the we could have made to get us to contention without drafting well."
"04 - D Wade &amp; LeBron coughing making fun of Dirk during the Heat/Mavs finals because Dirk was coming down with the flu.  06 - Russ not letting Steven answer a question from a local OKC beat reporter and constantly saying 'next question.'  13 - D Wade hits ridiculous game winning shot in last season with Heat.  15 - Westbrook/Durant cupcake debacle.  17 - Donovan Mitchell made a really funny video during the bubble about Jaylen Brown.  20 - Ball goes out of play in D Wade's final game and Melo pretends to shoot it in from the sidelines. He wasn't on a team at this point. Him, LeBron &amp; Chris Paul were all side of court watching it.  21 - How do you, as a RAPS FAN, not know this one?

"by that same token, what's the point of telling everyone to get vaccinated if herd immunity will come eventually?   &gt; why should vaccinated people still live with restrictions?  because the vaccine is not 100 percent guarantee against catching COVID. even in the NBA, you had players like Chris Paul get COVID even though they were vaccinated. Or in politics, people like Jesse Jackson. I've lost count of how many I know in my day to day life that were vaccinated but still got COVID.   &gt; How do people who still support restrictions after vaccination.  is saying that people should continue to wear a mask that big of a deal? I'm not talking about total lockdowns. people in Asian countries wore masks even before COVID-19 without any issues, so I don't get why people always get so upset over it here in the West."
"Bob Cousy = Steph Curry  Bob Cousy &gt; Chris Paul, Nash, Stockton, IT, Frazier, Kidd, Westbrook  Bob Cousy is horrendously underrated because his game looks funny from a 2021 perspective, but there’s a reason why he was the 10x consecutive first-team PG, and 8x assist leader. He was the first great PG, and the prototype of what the position looked like for decades."
"Lol what, have you ever seen Draymond play or Chris Paul? Lmao."
Players Association leaders' personal interests are always the priority. Never forget Chris Paul setting up that veteran supermax turd clause that only applied to him
Chris Paul &gt; Kevin Durant He is only behind LeBron and Steph in on court impact in the last decade.
Chris Paul?  They had prime cp3 before his knee injury
Deron Williams &gt; Chris Paul  This is all because I was enthralled by that comeback in the final minute Illinois had against...I forget who but that was some Reggie sh*t he got going. Plus those first few years Deron seemed unstoppable getting into the paint and scoring. I know their h2h match-ups leaned Deron's favor as well.
Chris Paul &gt; Isiah Thomas
"when you have a player like trae, your whole offense when he is on the floor is basically running the PnR through them, so i don't know how useful it is to try and reduce his impact by pointing out that that's where his advantages are. it's like saying shaq was only better than some other player in the post.   despite tatum being a better shooter, trae is a more efficient scorer on higher or similar volume, and his playmaking is way ahead of tatum's even if it's mostly concentrated in the PnR, which i again don't see as a big negative. you can say that stuff about chris paul to a degree as well, it doesn't take away from his game."

"&gt; Even since ballmer has come in they have consistently had all stars and just had kawhi and pg come because they are in la  Well Kawhi and PG are from LA and wanted to go home, rather than because they were just looking for someplace sunny or something. And whatever other All Stars the Clippers have had since Ballmer took over were already there when he bought the team, as Lob City started under Donald Sterling. The Clippers got Blake Griffin because they had the #1 overall pick in the draft, and they got Chris Paul mainly because after the NBA screwed up the CP3 to the Lakers trade and it was a huge PR fiasco, they had to work hard to orchestrate somewhere else to send him and the Clippers were the only other team with any assets to trade."
"Since 2005 they have had a generational talent every year outside of 2012, they have won two playoff series in that span. AD certainly didn't help by missing 108 games in seven years with them, but how do you only manage ONE playoff victory with freaking Chris Paul."

"I agree he wouldn't go number 1, but that wasn't a great [draft class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_NBA_draft) and I don't think he'd drop all that far. If you were redrafting, Chris Paul would obviously go number 1, but Bogut would probably still go top 5. He was a good passing bigman with workable shooting range that you could extend who was really sound defensively. He'd be a pretty handy player in the modern NBA. A more defensive Jokic type. Before his injuries  started adding up, he was All-NBA 3rd team (2010) and a consistent double double who led the league in blocks in 2011.  The only other players that might go above him are probably Deron Williams and Danny Granger."

"The Toronto Raptors, with its national history tied to the NBA will never be respected. Till this day I still shop at the first official NBA game ever(Loblaws, a major Canadian grocery chain). People really forget that Chris Paul doesn't have an NBA ring and Kyle Lowry does. Raptors never lost a finals game In America but does that ever matter? NBA gets an F for showcasing its international teams. Can't replicate Vancouver in modern NBA. Why would London ever be a choice or AUS? Think about it, you favourite player most likely doesn't have a ring and yet he's being paid more than 30M."
Chris Paul did a pretty good job against Jrue despite all of the ball pressure. Obviously had some struggles but Jrue is an incredible defender. It was awesome to see them go up against each other. Two of my favorite point guards in the league for a while
Bruh chris Paul at 14 I’m dead
"No. Too many GS homers in this thread. You aren't better than the Lakers, Utah, or Phoenix even if Klay is 90%. You don't have enough depth to finish top 4 in the regular season. If your rookies/young talent figure it out, you could be a scary first round team.  I actually like that they didn't make any crazy off-season moves. I think your windows is in a couple years when Lebron is old/retired and Chris Paul isn't as impactful for Phoenix."

"I really don’t get this thread here LMAO maybe I’m in the Lowry zone or something, but is it really become a hot take to say CP3 &gt; Lowry?   Raptors fans who are in here telling everyone “you have to WATCH him play” have you ever watched CHRIS PAUL play? LMFAO"
"It's definitely more of a draw for older players who have families (i.e someone like Chris Paul). There's a reason so many people in general like to retire in the Phoenix area. Great golf, cheaper real estate than the big California cities and if you want to party, Vegas and LA are a very short flight away. It might not be the most attractive place for a 25 year old millionaire but for someone 30+ it's a great destination. If they show a continued stretch of organizational stability, they'll do well in free agency"
"&gt;In the same season that Chris Paul took the Suns from bums to contenders, people were doubting Kyle Lowry's impact on elevating a team **when he's almost the same player.**  Kyle Lowry and CP3 are almost the same player??"
"Chris Paul, he can hit them and then shoulder-shake-shimmy with Curry any day of the week."
"A lot of Raptors fans tried telling people this and the fanbases of the teams that did pass on him were entirely full of shit about it. Saying that it wouldn't have made a difference, that Raptors fans were acting like homers, completely ignoring that Kyle Lowry was the #1 playmaker on a championship roster that had one of the toughest paths to the ring (aside from the finals) just two years ago.  The guy is an absolute game-changer and has skills that don't age. In the same season that Chris Paul took the Suns from bums to contenders, people were doubting Kyle Lowry's impact on elevating a team when he's almost the same player.  People are going to see this year what the Sixers missed out on last year. Every time he makes a disgusting needle hole pass, every time he takes a clutch late-game charge, everytime he bodies a guy twice his size while fighting for the ball, people are gonna see it."
Stockton isn't in the same realm as Chris Paul and Nash in terms of shot making
LeBron and Chris Paul are the first two that come to mind.
"neither the lakers or the nets, especially not the sixers or celtics either  nothing against nets fans, they dont seem bad, but fuck super teams  lakers, celtics and sixers fans however are insufferable  and fuck chris paul, hes a dirty player, dont want to see the suns in there  im good with the nuggies, la orphans(clippers) can fuck off dont really care for them  and for the east, the heat have a pretty likeable team, as do the bucks  bucks vs nuggies im gonna say"
Lebron was attacked at the knees like old school NFL…. If Lebron wasn’t assaulted in broad daylight we would have easily made it to the finals at least…. Lebron was still injured and the Suns are dirty… big whoop. Chris Paul is very clear about his play style. “I’ll run over my momma if it means a win” lmfao.
"Must be because they changed their name. Chris Paul isn't a meme, far from it. He is probably the most respected point guard in the league on this sub."
"Paul Pierce, Chris Paul, Dwyane Wade, and James Harden"
"&gt;That Kawhi less Clippers team took the Suns to 6 and was a basket away from it being 7.  The ""basket away"" occurring in a game where the Suns were missing Chris Paul.  Your argument is a bad one.  Move on."
"Hmmmmm  I'll give a hot take: Switch KD and Harden in that series and the Warriors lose  KD and Chris Paul might actually have better chemistry than Harden and Chris Paul tbh, the reason that pairing ended up breaking up is because they both wanted the ball in their hands constantly  Meanwhile Harden wouldn't fit the Warriors system at all"
Rajon Rondo &gt; Chris Paul
Chris Paul
Fuck Chris Paul
DeAndre looks like he found another Chris Paul
"I wasn't ambiguous at all, if I didn't abbreviate the name I used the last name for every other player. It's Chris Paul.  Lillard is Bizzaro Gobert; really good on one end, really limited on the other. I think Dame is overrated because he's a volume scorer - he's awful on defense which is half of the game. I'd love to have him on my team but I wouldn't pick him over Gobert. Chris Paul has a serious injury every year; even last postseason he got hurt against the Lakers and was a liability, it's just that the Lakers were more injured and the rest of the Suns could pick up Paul's slack until he got right again.  And I already confessed to bias, so I'm not going to go through the reasons why I pick Gobert over the rest."
"""Hey look its my favorite player Chris Paul"" - film screen"
"John Stockton is overrated. Probably the most perfect form of game manager that we will ever see, and gaudy counting stats for sure, but never the tier of player that you feared or expected to take over a game.  The lack of a ring is barely ever cited as a knock against Stockton the way it is with guys like Malone or Barkley because we instinctively know that he doesn't really stand at that same threshold of greatness in the first place.  Also kind of dirty, for all the shit we give Chris Paul."
First of all did you miss the part where Zion played at an all nba level with a roster build to not maximize his strengths?   &gt;the problem is him not adams or Jonas   Lmao okay tell me more about how you don’t know what you’re talking about. If you got Shaq in the paint you don’t make him play with a team of non shooters. Or if you have an elite playmaker like Chris Paul you don’t make him play next to a ball dominant chucker and not let Paul run the offense. That’s just objectively stupid.    &gt;Zion’s biggest fit issues are his pants  Yes the guy who scores 27 points on over 60% from the field with zero spacing is the issue and so is his weight and not the fact that… his team sucks and isn’t build to help him?
"You’re right but would he move the needle of the Pelicans value that much for the league? I don’t think so, not enough to not want Chris Paul on the lakers in some big conspiracy"
Chris Paul. I think he'll still be a respectable PG but I think he's seen his last all-star game
Chris Paul at the top for 2 teams is wild.
"Prior to injuries, he had 3 straight seasons hovering around 20+ points (including 23 points in '17) and 10+ assists, and \~2 steals per game, where he improved in almost every category each year.  In '16-'17, he was 18th in the NBA in points, 2nd in assists (ahead of Westbrook and Chris Paul), and 2nd in steals while shooting 45% from the field (higher than all but 6 of the non-post players ahead of him, ahead of Westbrook, Harden, and Lilliard).  It absolutely isn't outlandish to think he could have been a top 10 player without injuries."
"Russ, Chris Paul, LeBron.  I'd also put Julius Randle in there. Not decline in the same sense as the other one, but I don't think he's going to give us another 20/10/5 season."
"they're each still better players than zach because of playmaking. he turns it over too much, and doesn't have nearly the vision, pnr feel/in-between game, and passing bag that all these guys have.  but as a secondary scorer attacking rotating defenses, hes better than all of them. no guard in the league has his combination of spot up shooting, pull up shooting, and slashing as zach.  just look at the comparison of last season. booker played on an amazing team, where he got to be the second guard/playmaker behind chris paul, on an amazing, coherent team offense. lavine basically had to pound the rock on a shit team with shit teammates, with defenses concerned literally only about him. he scored more points on higher efficiency. it's lowkey one of the more ludacris scoring seasons the league saw last year, given the context.  [https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm\_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player\_id1=lavinza01&amp;p1yrfrom=2021&amp;player\_id2=bookede01&amp;p2yrfrom=2021](https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1=lavinza01&amp;p1yrfrom=2021&amp;player_id2=bookede01&amp;p2yrfrom=2021)  booker 2020-21 (age 24 season): 25.6 ppg, 48.4% FG on 19.2 attempts per game, 34% 3PT on 5.5 attempts, 86.7% FT on 5.9 attempts, 4.3 assists, 3.1 turnovers  lavine 2020-21 (age 25 season): 27.4 ppg, 50.7% FG on 19.4 attempts per game, 41.9% 3PT on 8.2 attempts, 84.9% FT on 5.1 attempts, 4.9 assists, 3.5 turnovers"

"Towns is one of the worst guys to watch right now in terms of emotion. He’s at Lebron levels of pouting every play. The worst was when he tried to game out a charge call on JV, rightfully got called for a blocking foul, then had a fit over the call. There’s got to be some embarrassment when you’re mad you didn’t get one over on the refs. On top of that, you’ve got the Chris Paul style acting and flopping.   I understand he’s getting fouled sometimes and it gets missed, but it’s not as bad as he’s making it out to be  he’s hurting his team not staying in the game."
three years ago he was probably less invested in Chris Paul winning a ring. but now that he's on the Suns he probably wants him to win a ring more than he did before. but let's see what he says
Wtf does Chris Paul has to do with my comment ?
Chris Paul is one of the greats and a future Hall of Famer with or without a ring but he was never really the best PG of the league at any point in his career.
Chris Paul and Joel Embiid
Chris Paul is an ass on the court who I hope never wins a ring
Chris Paul Laker trade being blocked  T-Mac not staying in Toronto  OKC not paying Harden  Sacramento drafting Luka
I feel like hardcore basketball fans know how dirty Chris Paul can be but more casual fans don't.
"Chris Paul, he's been phenomenal in so many places, but doesn't really have a decade (or even 7 years) in any one place."
"Chris Paul, OK, but for bigs it's kind of a different ballgame. I'm sure Jokic can hit midrange shots consistently but for him it's going to be more of a catch-and-shoot off of a pick and pop situation, or even if he gets the ball outside with his back to the basket, he's generally squaring off against another big, which generally means he's facing someone slower, or else if it's a smaller, faster player he has the length to just plain shoot over them.  It's not quite as clear-cut in the modern league but I think when it comes to centers in particular this still comes into play. It's not that he's bad or even merely good at the shot, it's that a smaller player has to do a bit more in terms of footwork, etc. to make up for the lack of height. And, I'm not saying that this applies to Jokic at all, as he's pretty good at playing within himself, but I feel like some wild BS is sometimes allowed from bigger players because their height still allows them to get away with it sometimes (see: KP)."
"i checked out the blazers subreddit to see how they were holding on in there, and another wild theory i saw someone propose was that the suns purposely lost against the blazers because monty and chauncey are boys, or something, and cp3 also loves chauncey, so they wanted to do something nice for him. 😅  https://www.si.com/nba/trailblazers/analysis/chris-paul-praises-big-brother-chauncey-billups-after-clinching-finals-berth"
Jokic and Chris Paul
Chris Paul cant do this btw
More FMVP votes than Chris Paul has ever had
"I like the Sixers, and only the Sixers.  But there are plenty of other players that I root for.  TJ McConnell, RoCo, Kemba Walker, Chris Paul, Dario Saric, Jimmy Butler, Demar Derozan, Bobi, Deaaron Fox, and a couple more.  I’d never root for any of these players when they play against Philly but I do any other time."
Both better than Chris Paul that’s for sure
"I was rewatching that Warriors series and Chris Paul was so bad. He was actually bad that entire postseason  He looked so washed and done. I dont blame anyone for wanting CP3 gone, just think we overpaid for Westbrook."
I have him over Chris Paul all time
"It takes teams to win championships, not just one guy. Jordan didn't make it out of the first round without Pippen and Oscar needed Kareem. It doesn't make sense to put TP over Dwight for winning when Parker had Pop, Duncan, Manu for practically his whole career. Dwight's version of that is Jameer and Hedo. You can argue Chris Paul out out of the five PGs* and he's *easily* better than Tony Parker."
"Chris Paul got injured in the 17-18 WCF. The Rockets didn't re-sign Ariza after almost beating GSW that year. In 18-19, the roster got significantly worse and CP3 and Gordon got injured, Harden had to carry the team for months at a time. Still, the team didn't go far in the playoffs. Everyone thought CP3's contract was awful after that and so they pulled off the WB trade, but WB sucked and CP3 actually was able to help a young Thunder team and then went to the Suns and has done even better.  IMO, it seems there was a lot of tension between Harden and CP3 at times too. CP3 naturally wants to be the leader but Harden was the face of the franchise so they often butted heads."
James Harden didn't want to play with Chris Paul anymore.
"The Cavs have been trash all of eternity, Lebron turned them into contenders. The same franchise you’re talking about, Chris Paul got them to a 2 seed. Milwaukee has been average for a long time, Giannis turned them into contenders and then won a ring,  great players make shit happen. AD has never led a team to anything.  He never makes the players around him better.  Even Kyrie has won series as the guy, had the celtics as the 1 seed and he went down right before the playoffs started in 2018.  People say players like Beal and Cousins, KAT were overrated because they never led their team to anything and somehow AD is in the upper echelon of players even though he’s never led anyone to anything either. You keep trying to bring up Lebron like this isn’t just about AD.  This whole comment thread is about AD. He’s not fucking anywhere near Lebron legacy wise. He doesn’t compare at all.  He could never do what Lebron has done.  He gets mentioned with the Bron’s, KD, Steph’s Hardens, Giannis, he’s not in that tier. You could argue he’s not in the same Tier as Jokic and Embiid because even they’ve taken teams far."
Lebron will become the first player with 30k points and 10k assists which is insane because 2 days ago Chris Paul became the first player with 20k points and 10k assists.
"That there's this unwritten rule to not score on a team when the game is out of reach as time winds down. Chris Paul scored on a team in this situation. I loved his reply; ""Y'all wasn't guarding."" You're paid to put the ball into the hoop (among other things). The losing teams still shoot until clock hits zero so why should the winners stop shooting?"
When CP3 was the president everything he did was to make as much money as possible as a superstar in the NBA. I dont think CJ will have the same goals that chris paul had so.
"I have watched every single playoff game of the Rockets during the CP3 and Harden era. Chris Paul was great in the first season, but got injured and Rockets couldn’t beat the Warriors. That was fine, everyone was happy and he got the big contract he wanted. Everyone thought next year will be their chance.  But the second year, oh man was that ugly. Chris Paul frankly, played like shit, especially in the playoff. Yes so did Harden, but that doesn’t mean it justifies for CP3 to play like shit, especially you are getting paid $40 million.   The worse thing was CP3 trying to tell Harden how to play. I have no doubt it’s helpful given his experience as a point guard, and maybe whatever he said was right, but you don’t do it in front of everyone (CP3 did it courtside during a game) to a team’s leader. Harden has a really, really laid back personality, to a point I think he lacks the fire like other top players, yet he got so pissed they had an argument right there during the game. Even later when CP3 joined the Suns, he said in an interview that he should probably not say much about the team’s leadership and leave it to Booker. So I would say it’s unfair to put all the blame to Harden on that one."
"poor harden, the rockets only gave him dwight howard, chris paul, and russell westbrook to play with!"
CP3 was an absolute zero in the second Golden State series. He had an unexpected resurgence after going to OKC but people forget Houston wins that series against GS if Chris Paul showed signs of life.
"Are you going to ignore Harden running Chris Paul out of town? He forced their hand to get Westbrook, he didn’t like playing with CP3 and look how that turned out for both guys. Harden loses in the second round last year and Paul is in the finals.  The Rockets gave him 3 all stars to play with, if he wanted to be like LeBron and control the roster maybe he should have made a few finals appearances and not melt down in big games."
Lol his game is nothing like Chris Paul.  Brutal reference point
"Also, a lot of SGA’s improvements came from playing with Chris Paul. He would still be great, but you could see him learn a lot that year."
"Chris Paul, Wade and Dwight were better"
"SGA isn’t anywhere near to Chris Paul as a playmaker or table setter. At this stage of his development he’s more of a scoring guard, and as a scorer PG is on a different level than sga"
08 Chris Paul
"Chris Paul. Certified. Lillard... maybe... but the rest of them? Hell naw. (Also, I'd take Lowry over Irving anyways, don't care if Lowry is 36)."
"Yes and he's wrong. Hyperaware doesn't mean that Harden isn't more egregious. It's like when Chris Paul would mug Steph several times, early on in the game to ""set the tone"". Either the refs would have to give Paul like 3-4 fouls in the first quarter or let shit fly.  Nash wants Harden to be able to keep doing his bullshit at the same frequency but to only be called for it occasionally."
"Russ a mere 3 rebounds and 1 TO away from adding to his #1 all time quadruple double stat.  With Melo moving up a spot in the all time point ranks this game, it also saw AD move into the Top 50 for blocks (that is the only category of pt/reb/ast/st/bl/to that Lebron isn't in the top 50 as he is back at #106). Lebron is now 7 steals away from getting to the #12 all time steals spot.  And I noticed that Chris Paul is going to be jumping from #5 to #3 on assists within the next few games."
Andrew Bo-got and Heggim Warrick. And sophomore guard Chris Paul from Wake Forest rebounded out...the list.

"&gt; I mean Klay hasn’t even played for two years. I don’t think that really matters  quoting Chris Paul ""in this league you're no better than your last game""  people remember Klay in his peak, and remember Draymond as his current self  it's simple as that"
Irving.  Lillard.  Chris Paul.    Those are the only 3 point guards i'd play Curry out of position for.  Young is the next closest.  Luka can play a point forward position.
I agree with you. Imagine Chris Paul in his place lol
Chris Paul?
"See this is hard for me, because I like different point guards for different reason as I imagine most people do, I don’t think there’s a PG that’ll sit that top of all those brackets, like obviously Curry has got the outside shot, but Lonzo’s IQ is quite high, and you have players like Doncić and Harden who have shown they can pass well, but when you’re evaluating which player best represents a PG I personally have to choose CP3, Chris Paul has incredible passing and IQ and a reliable outside shot, but the way he moves the offence and makes plays for others is what a PGs main responsibility is in my opinion.   Obviously there so many incredible PGs out there and some are fantastic to watch, like Kyrie and his ability to put the ball on a string is second to none and Curry is the greatest shooter of all time, but when I think of a point guard currently in the league that does that job better than anyone, my mind always goes to Chris Paul"
"I’m expecting perimeter defenders to not get beat at the rate they were getting beat in that series. That level of defensive incompetence is inexcusable.   The exact same thing didn’t happen with Houston at all. When Houston matched up against Utah they still had Capela. They rarely ran 5 out. Gobert did underperform against Houston, but that’s cause Harden and chris Paul would constantly target him 1v1. No Centre save for maybe Anthony Davis and bam Adebayo are handling that. Again you could either blame harden for being so good, or blame the Jazz perimeter defenders/ defensive schemes for allowing switches to be forced so easily, but you can’t blame a 7 foot rim protection specialist for not being able to guard an MVP guard in isolation.   And no it’s literally not that. When he was guarding the 3 point shooters like Morris and Batum, he was handling them just fine. Because they were playing as catch and shoot players. They were easy to defend. The issues came when Gobert had to help inside. Again what exactly do you expect in those scenarios ? You’re either asking Gobert to be in two places at once, or you blame his team mates for allowing the blow-by. There aren’t other options.   You’re just showing how much you’re running with the narrative and not actually paying attention to what’s happening with Gobert by comparing Houston and LAC, which were completely different issues for Gobert"
Obviously Chris Paul.
game 5 Chris Paul mode Rn
"Rose handles and footwork are smooth as hell. I think even in his athletic prime, his handles never got the props they deserved cause he was so quick and explosive. He has a much better handle than Curry for instance, but for a couple of years you heard how people always praised Curry's handles, but never heard the same for Rose when he was dominating. Since I have been watching the NBA, Kyrie, Rose, Chris Paul and Deron Williams have the best handles I have seen in the league."
gobert is not a solid for a center on perimeter. Stop it. Chris paul always tries to get gobert switched on him.
"Yeah to me it'd be more accurate to say he was challenging Chris Paul, Deron Williams, and maybe still Steve Nash as top PG."
What happens when chris paul trains you.
What a piece of shit move by Booker. Chris Paul influence at work.

"Chris Paul ain't appreciated by almost everyone in the west, until he's on your team lol"
Nothing.  Chris Paul is not appreciated by most dubs fans...
"""...and when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.""  Former President Chris Paul"
Chris Paul is a big mentor to this team
Chris Paul’s hamstring saved them in 2018. That’s the Harden/Paul Rockets. The goddamn Rodman Bulls would beat them.
I love you rondo man but you know we can't just believe your word after spitting chris paul incident
Kevin Garnett timberwolves Chris Paul Pelicans Iverson 76ers Shaq magic  Shaq and penny(if healthy) would have won championships if ownership didn’t piss shaq off by lowballing him on his contract.   Currently appears to be failing Zion pelicans Embid 76ers Kat timberwolves  Anybody on the kings
It’s mostly cause people hate Chris Paul more
"Rip throughs are still a foul, source: avid Chris Paul watcher. They were probably in the bonus so he got free throws"
My favorite point guard Chris Paul is capping
"&gt;Chris Paul taking the ball up the court and slowing down to force the defender into him.  They still call that and they should. It penalizes the offensive player because the defensive player is in a bad position as much as it sucks, you could let someone past you and stay one inch behind them and they'd be forced to go forward."
In this era the 2 is almost always open. Chris Paul holds leads with simple 2s every game.   It's not a bad shot.  It's the shooter that determines if the shot is a good one. Curry's shots are not good ones for anyone else.
Remember when he spat on Chris Paul and people still defended him lmao
Chris Paul from mid range off the same play over and over buried the Nugs last year in the playoffs. If it works it works.
"Chris paul, not getting a charge call and literaly the same play happened two or three plays before that for the lakers. The calls were atrocious through the entire game. One of the worse games ive watched when it came to refs they controlled the entire game and stopped it for extended periods of times on numerous occassions"
I didn't expectorate on Chris Paul.  He just got in the way of my spittle.
The pelicans failed chris paul by being a bad fo and not getting him the supporting cast he needed   The first run leGM had with the Cavs was atrocious with FO decisions   The lakers ruined 3 years of kobe Bryant's prime  The celtics used IT3 then discarded him for kyrie   The bulls ruined d rose by keeping him in a game they had a large enough margin to win without him on the floor
"By the numbers over the last few years, it’s been Jokic and Chris Paul neck and neck.   There’s a website that I don’t have on hand right now, but it tracks stuff that it considers clutch (+/- 5 points with less than 5 minutes) as well as double clutch (I can’t remember if this was game winners at the buzzer or if it’s a certain % chance towards winning with a make/miss). Obviously there are probably multiple different people/sites that track clutch stats by various different metrics. Every single one I’ve seen in the past 2-3 years has always been Jokic and CP3 in some order of 1 and 2.  Edit: /u/llewellynjean might actually have numbers on this."
"I think there is a difference between what you are describing and what, say, Chris Paul does, where he doesn't jump stop and jump *straight up* by actually fades backwards into the trailing defender.  Straight up is the always your space in basketball. But any time you are purposefully towards another player to create contact, that's an issue. I mean, it's fine to go at a player if you are going towards the rim, but you don't have aright to all airspace as an offensive player."
Chris Paul.
Chris Paul Is just as bad of a complainer and whiner
If Chris Paul (who is 5th all-time in assists) maintains his averages of playing 72 games a season and averaging 9.4 assists per game he'll get there by the time he's 45 years old. Yeah that's probably going to stand for a while.
Or how Chris Paul nearly ended his life in game 1. He was also complaining about the life threatening hard foul that Crowder did earlier which was totally safer than the push he gave DA
"Man you gotta chill the fuck out. My argument isn’t that hard to understand. I’ll break it down so you don’t get confused.   &gt; I point out that the standard of a front office surrounding their star player with literal generational talent is a totally unfair expectation  It absolutely is if you wanted to beat the greatest fucking team of all time  * The front office’s best move was trading for Chris Paul. That was clearly the best the rockets played in the Harden era, which isn’t surprising given he’s the exact type of talent I’m talking about. Now here’s the fucking issue: Chris Paul is injury prone, and the team chose to give him a huge contract despite his hamstring injury that would, no pun intended, hamstring the team later on.  * Now, the rockets could only sign minimum contracts and use the MLE  * AVAILABILITY MATTERS IN THE WEST AND IN THE PLAYOFFS. Why can’t you understand this?? Harden didn’t have to average 36 pts with the nets to get second seed, but he had to do it with Houston to barely get us to the playoffs when CP/Capela were injured  * This had consequences, Harden was fatigued by the time he got to the playoffs  * but lets assume this is negligible and go back to the main point. Harden DID have success when CP was healthy in the playoffs. But CP was not available for 2 playoff runs, and he took up the entire cap space and prevented the team from picking up other talent to replace his gap  * as a result, we traded for Russ. But as great of a player he was, Russ still could not take much defensive attention given his lack of shooting and given his subpar play in the playoffs because of his quad injury"
&gt;He's the most lethal mid range shooter in the league.            Chris Paul would like a word.
"You definitely seem to be biased apparently when you think that shit wasn't hard and enough of a push on a skinny PG lol   What Crowder did was way more screwed up in my book, dude is flying at you and he just bruhes him off like he doesn't give a fuck.. such a dirty player, just like Chris Paul can be.  I agree tho, the 2 day slander on this was a bit over the top, even for me as a Lakers fan.  But all of this doesn't make LeBrons puhs any less shitty too btw., clearly a stupid unnecessary move by him, even tho imo it came out of frustration.. so I may very well be a little biased here too haha"
“Chris Paul is just dribbling around right now” what. The. Hell.
"He was slick but I would rate him around Chris Paul, rondo, lebron level passing in recent memory and then of course kidd Stockton Jason Williams Magic if you want to go way back pistol Pete"
"nah bro, chris paul is destined to make the second round and THEN have an injury that costs his team the series."
Ok come on. I get on Lebron when he does Lenarrative things. Can’t be a hypocrite here. There’s 0 way Monty was sitting Chris Paul the whole night in basically a must win game.
...the Suns lost game 2 cause Chris Paul was hurt so I don’t wanna hear that BS
Chris Paul
Respect.   Fuck Chris Paul.
All year everyone who gets banned gets their name thrown into a hat.  At the end of the year Chris Paul pulls a name out of that hat and Adam Silver executes them.
My favorite Point Guard Chris Paul
I know he's struggled this series but he just sets a winning culture. Probably as big a deal for you guys as Chris Paul has been to be honest.  Isaiah and Jae coming to Boston pulled us out of a tank. He's had a similar impact in Memphis and Miami.
"They didn’t diagnose him with numbness, that’s his speculation. Besides they’re letting Chris Paul play with a similar injury right now. There’s no need to create an excuse for a series his been doing amazing in up to this point."
"Yeah I can see that too. Crowder is a player you hate when he’s not on your team. I absolutely loathed him on the jazz. Based on stuff I’ve seen across a bunch of games, I don’t think I would label what crowder did as malicious. Intentional sure, but not malicious.   I just don’t think it was malicious. It’s Lebrons curse. It’s near impossible to just wrap him up bc of how big and strong he is. And like with your point if it were chris Paul, he probably would’ve been hurt or it very dangerous. I don’t think that was super dangerous for lebron purely bc of how big he is. And the fact that he wasn’t in the air or any of that. If crowder grabbed him a second later with his momentum going up, then maybe I’d feel otherwise, but lebron was still moving forward, leaning forward, and his momentum was not upwards yet."
A lot of Laker fans were downplaying this the other day in that Chris Paul push thread. I was told that Lebron was actually bracing Embiid from falling.
"Speaking of Chris Paul in an Atlanta thread, never forget the Hawks took a college bench player over CP3"
Lol is Chris Paul not a star? He is dirtier then Lebron. I don't how I'm getting down votes right now. All the clowns like you out of the wood work after a laker loss.
"i think lebron is gonna have to find it in him to get the lakers past the suns. lebron doesn’t look 100% healthy but outside of lebron, this lakers team is so bad. nobody can seem to hit an open shot. it’s not a good sign. suns look young &amp; healthy outside of chris paul laboring with the shoulder injury."
Hard to play well when you're nearly the only offensive threat on the court. He benefits greatly from a healthy Chris Paul being on the court
I don't know who the dirtiest star player of all time is. But Chris Paul is definitely dirter then Lebron.
"Chris Paul scored 6 points on an efficient 3/6 from the field in the first half with 6 assists and ZERO turnovers... He was actually less efficient in the second half at 4/9 and assisted 3 more times for a total 9 assists, with his the suns scoring +9 on the 32 minutes he was on the floor... Chris Paul didn't look bothered at all (aside from his missed 3ptrs... which everyone was bricking Lakers included) and was ultra efficient in the first half. He just turned the defense up a notch in the second half and made timely shots.  Also, it's ludicrous to think CP3 won the game for us when 6 Suns players scored in double digits and he wasn't even the highest in pt differential with Booker at +12, Ayton at +12 and Crowder at +21. They were doing TEAM BALL which is how basketball should be played...not hoping for two monster games from your two best players to carry you to a championship like last year...  So yes, the Suns figured out AD and his defense wouldn't have made that much of a difference the way the Lakers played tonight and the way the suns played defense and offense, swinging the ball, not doing ISO plays , which is where ADs defense shines one on one. It was the perfect example of how team ball won against iso bully ball.  That being said, I'm really hoping AD isn't injured long term. Would love to see him in game 5 and see how the Lakers adjust. Good game and looking forward to game 5. GO SUNS!!!"
"it looks like chris paul fouled him, he smacked schroder's arm as he was about to lay it in"
Why does it seem that Chris Paul has his his team go to game 7 in every playoff series he ever plays in?  Does he know he can win playoff series before game 7?
"LOVE Chris Paul and the game of the entire sun's team.  Wanna trade, brad Stevens for Monty, we'll even throw in kemba!  And grant Williams!"
Counterpoint: Luka is better now than Chris Paul was at his peak.
"***All-NBA 1st Team***      C: Nikola Jokic      F: Joel Embiid      F: Giannis Antetokounmpo      G: Luka Doncic      G: Steph Curry      ***All-NBA 2nd Team***      C: Rudy Gobert      F: Julius Randle      F: Zion Williamson      G: Damian Lillard      G: Chris Paul      ***All-NBA 3rd Team***      C: Bam Adebayo      F: Kawhi Leonard      F: LeBron James      G: Jimmy Butler      G: Paul George"
"You could be right about AD’s offense, but I find it funny that you’re using first half numbers to extrapolate for the second half when Chris Paul looked bothered the first half and then amazing the second. If he got injured and left at halftime, someone could have made similar claims as you are, but they would have been wrong. Teams make adjustments and I don’t think you can definitively say that the suns just figured AD out.   Also, I think AD’s defense would have been much needed (even if he is limited). Drummond was incredibly bad in the second half, and having AD instead of him would have made a difference."
I love Chris Paul
"LeBron does that as well lol. Gets hit and falls to the ground clearly in pain, and stays on the court completely fine. He already did that when Chris Paul fouled him in game 1 lol"
all you have to see is him needing to throw the ball underhanded for the 3pt heave as time expired to end the half. anybody that wants to tell me that a healthy chris paul would shoot a granny style shot in a pivotal playoff game needs their head checked
"The Lion King fits well. The iconic shot of the sun setting over the Lion Kingdom is a metaphor to the Phoenix Suns creating the dusk to King LeBron's long career. Simba held up in the air represents Booker and the young ones coming to replace the King. The baboon guy is basically Chris Paul holding Booker up into the Sun, showing him the world that will soon be his. It's the circle of ~~life~~ ball."
"This is a dumb take. Yea Monty is their coach but at the end of the day you can only do so much. That’s on Chris Paul and book, not him. I’m sure he was advocating for that"
I wish we held on to Chris Paul
It really doesn't make sense Chris Paul to the Lakers was blocked but they let harden to the nets....
Oh man I really hope Chris Paul gets healthy what a shame for the series not even fun now
Chris Paul was averaging 6 points a game before tonight
Lakers lost to the corpse of Chris Paul and chuck Booker.
"Chris ""I'm the glue that holds this ship together"" Paul"
Chris Paul and Anthony David can audition for MR. Glass 2.
I...that's actually not a bad take. I'd say Chris Paul but then CP3 would be the more important player than the best.
Bro you got Chris Paul on your team lol
Thanks man! I love mutual respect. Chris Paul has terrible luck most seasons so I hope he's good and keeps this competitive. I think this is going to 7.
Jazz had some weird games against them this year… plus their only home game was the first week of the season before Utah kicked it into gear. Chris Paul is a killer for them though.
"Didn't watch game, lol. Chris paul is far from healthy this series"
"Some observations:  Chris Paul looks like he's largely recovered from that shoulder injury. Had his best game of the series thus far - 18 points and 9 assists on 0 turnovers.  Deandre Ayton had another solid game - 14 points on 6-8 shooting, 17 rebounds and 2 steals - 0 turnovers as well.  The Lakers' fate is very much measured by Anthony Davis in this series. He plays badly in Game 1, they lose. He plays great in Games 2 and 3, they win. He plays gimpy in Game 4, they lose.  Now, for the elephant in the room - LeBron James. He's been solidly consistent, and his impact numbers bear it out, but he still hasn't had a transcendent, series defining performance. Will Game 5 be it?"
It's the new Chris Paul!
And we almost stole game 2 with a 25% Chris Paul? You can go both ways.   Our supporting cast is the reason we’re the 2 seed.   You should watch us sometime
Chris Paul: There you go!
Acting like Chris Paul wasn't playing with one arm for 90% of the series
"My money still on Suns. With AD out, it leaves them open and Chris Paul could take advantage of that weak spot"
Suns undefeated after Chris Paul publicly calls out referees
"Maddening.    LeBron and AD need a third superstar to beat Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton and Chris Paul?"
"I have not been a huge fan of Chris Paul mostly cause of his antics sometimes, but dude is a gamer and has been since he came into the league. It’s been said already, but look at CP3, so inspirational. Has me cheering for him."
"Haha you think I'm stupid. The Rockets got to game 7 with Chris Paul and Eric Gordon making some very big shots in the last minutes, not Harden. Harden had 2 opportunities to close out the Warriors that year. Had bad games in both of them. You forgot about the Spurs series and the Blazers series beyond the KD-less Warriors handling him. Nice try."
My guy.  You have Chris Paul.  That dude alone ain’t never gonna let his team quit.  I don’t give a fuck about Chrissy but I know that much about him.
"I’m glad Chris Paul is healthier too, I think having that extra day off helped too.  GG man on to the next one"
Do you recall what Lakers fans were saying about the Suns missing Chris Paul?
Lebrons just ramping up. If AD is out he’s gonna turn it up for sure. Lebrons never lost in the first round and he ain’t losing to bitch ass never made a finals Chris Paul
"If Chris Paul was healthy, Suns would likely be up 2-1 going into this game so yeah…"
Lakers win with Chris Paul missing: they got lucky  Suns win with Anthony Davis missing: NO DIFFERENCE
Chris Paul ate some senzu beans last night
He thought Paul was too short. He didn't realize Chris has that Cliff booster pack.
Chris Paul did it before AD tho
"Not even sure that was Chris Paul, might've been the imposter Chris Paul from the State Farm commercials  Fr he was borderline useless when he was hurt"
ADisney trying to save his legacy. ADisney = SOFT. ADisney doesn't got what it takes to play through injury like Chris Paul. Suns in 6.
Chris Paul was on the court.
"""The following is a press release by mr Chris Paul the 3rd, to be released immediately..""  ""I'm back"""
Fuck chris paul
"If AD is playing the next games, Lakers win otherwise it probably goes to a game 7 since the Suns bascially have zero answers to the Lakers defense except for a Chris Paul mid range."
"Analytics will never be able to measure the impact a guy like Chris Paul has on the floor, just take your eyes off the stat sheet and appreciate greatness."
Chris Paul is a fuckin beast
"inb4 “BuT AD wAs iNjuReD” ... Chris Paul has been a corpse for two games and Lakers still have Lebron. Home court going back to Phoenix, huge momentum swing."
Chris Paul just wildly dribbling around the dejected Lakers on the second to last possession is one of the funniest things I've ever seen.
Chris Paul still played
Chris Paul pulling the strings tonight
Why is Chris Paul acting like he knows what it takes to win a ring
Why does Chris Paul sound like he’s always about to cry
chris paul dribbling around like me spamming the right stick on 2k lol
I mean Chris Paul is hurt too
Lakers fans really tried telling me a healthy Chris Paul wouldn’t have made a difference in games 2 and 3
"Chris Paul made the entire difference, phoenix loses this game by 20 if he plays how he played on his hurt shoulder. Night and day difference"
Chris Paul is back
Chris Paul and Kyrie gonna be the only players from Space Jam 2 to make it out the first round
Uh ohhhhhh... Chris Paul starting to look like Chris Paul again   Feel for AD
but ad is injured bro!!!!  yea and chris paul has been injured the entire series xd
Gasol somehow processed that Chris Paul jumped infront of him and still through it to Chris
“You don’t want to run the clock down too much.”  You literally do Jeff lol. The Lakers are charging. The Suns need to slow things down. Chris Paul knows this.
Chris Paul GOAT
OH MY GOD CHRIS PAUL THAT WAS SO CLUTCH
CHRIS PAUL LITERALLY CARRYING THE SUNS HOLY SHIT
that's an incredible steal by Chris Paul
Chris Paul just floated in the air to get that steal
Chris Paul is so clutch
How Chris Paul is this good still
"This game is proof that the Suns are a product of Chris Paul, not Monty Williams. Poor coaching!"
Chris Paul scored 6 times on the same play
I wonder what could've gone down if they somehow found a way to flip Kyrie for Damian or Chris Paul
exactly. and Chris Paul/westbrook never said that.
"Friendship with Gobert ended, Chris Paul is my new best friend!"
"You ever watch Chris Paul play? This Harden pass probably wouldn't crack the top 100 passes of his career lol.   [This Pass through 4 defenders in a congested half court set defense is way crazier than the harden pass](https://youtu.be/5QFiOPbltpk)  Tbh, this harden pass wouldn't even crack hardens top 50 passes from the last 5 years lmao"
"Is Chris Paul not a PG? Is westbrook not a PG? eh, boi."
Nah chris paul is
"Bruh, this is such an ignorant take. Rockets, with no Chris Paul, lost by 9 against the great team ever + the refs. How the fuck is that choking?"
&gt; next time  [lmao](https://tenor.com/view/cp3-chris-paul-rockets-shimmy-steph-curry-gif-11883957)
This dude just said CP3 is easily above trae. 16 and 10 chris paul?
"Three-point shooter. Steph is so good off the dribble and catch and shoot situations. I think there have been better midrange shooters than him like Dirk, MJ and Chris Paul. Kyrie also up there as honorable mention as an all-around shooting threat."
"Yeah to be clear I’m totally with you on everything CP3 brings. I think there’s a good amount of players that people consider to be “better” that would not have helped the Suns this much. But people gotta understand that just because a team is having a great season that they must have an MVP candidate. I’m not sure if I think CP3 deserves an all nba team, but I’d be fine with him getting a 3rd team spot. But that’s very different than being a real mvp candidate.  Also, at the end of the day, you just can’t tell me he’s a more valuable player than jokic, embiid, curry, giannis, or lebron (just to name a few guys) at this point in their careers, no matter how you define MVP. Any one of those guys vs the field and I could respect your argument. But Chris Paul? Definitely not."

"Doncic, Trae, and Harden all have a longer time of possession per game. He averages less seconds per touch than all of the above plus Dame and Chris Paul and has less touches than Jokic. None of them average as many assists as he does."
"There's only 5 guys in the world making that pass: Harden, Chris Paul, Jokic, Lebron, and Luka  edit: ok maybe this was a bad take"
"Jokic won it months ago, that why the narrative has just been about talking about Steph and Chris Paul, it boring to just state obvious shit."
"It's a tough line because again I think he brings things to the table that numbers can evaluate in the traditional sense.  For example I think everyone in PHX is defending at a higher level because CP3 is an excellent defender and leader but the numbers don't really reflect that it's because of Chris Paul outside of the fact that every Chris Paul team defends at a high level.  Plus he effects the pace of game better than anyone other than Curry, Lebron and Russ.  Every Chris Paul team becomes a Chris Paul team because of his playstyle and it is often for better.  So it's really tricky.  To be fair Nate did say he thinks Chris will make the All NBA team even if he doesn't believe he should."
"I would love to hear the argument for this, Vanvleet is a decent scorer. Chris Paul controls the tempo of the game and is the maestro of the offence. Basketball is not just about ppg."
"When Chris Paul had nightmares, they always take place in the Bay Area."
Would it not have been Chris Paul then instead of Tony Parker?
"Right, but Nate went off on how stupid it was to see Chris Paul in the MVP conversation (he was as high as 4th on one leaderboard) and he was saying literally the only argument for CP was suns were bad last year, they got Chris Paul, suns are good this year.  And he’s totally right. Im a Chris Paul fan, but 16 and 9 are just not MVP numbers at all. And yes I understand he brings way more to the table than his numbers, but there needs to be some baseline of good numbers to be considered."
"You still don't understand.  It's OK your IQ is something that doesn't go up or down much once you've hit a certain age, usually by the time you hit adulthood.  IQ is not your specific knowledge of a subject but rather your intuitive understanding of the world around you.    IQ tests measure your ability to recognize complex patterns and your ability to use logic to figure out what comes next.  It does not test your ability to memorize world capitals.  Similarly BBIQ is a measure of your ability to understand what is happening in the game around you, what the offense is trying to do to score on you/ how the defence is trying to stop you from scoring.    Lebron james played basketball for a decade before coming into the NBA and had a full understanding of how the game of basketball is played.  His intuition for the game was off the charts and this was one of his many highlights on his draft report.  He was a basketball genius, much like Chris Paul, before he came into the league.    What he learned in the NBA was NBA specific and had nothing to do with his understanding of basketball but rather his understanding of the physical freakish attributes of his NBA opponents.  This is a learning process that every single NBA player must go through and has nothing to do with BBiQ.  If you don't understand how this is different from BBIQ I can't help you.pp"
I agree but it's not easily.  Nate argumebt was that CP3 has not statistical argument whatsoever but I'd argue that Chris Paul effects the game beyond the stats but then again I'm not sure if that should be taken in consideration for All NBA.  Like what is the serious criteria for making it.  If it's the best 6 seasons for guards thab Trae and Beal should be locks but if it's a combination of other factors CP3 deserves it as well.
They're excuses because dubs win with or without Chris Paul lol.   2018 rockets were good. KD warriors were just better. They are the GOAT team.  Ain't no team led by Harden and Paul gonna knock off the warriors. They're playoff chokers.   You were destined to lose. Accept it and move on lol.
"How the fuck are they pointless excuses? We were good in 2018, not so much in 2019. That is factually backed up. You don’t win  Chris Paul plays, you absolutely got bailed the fuck out"
"The way he's evolved his game this year makes it seem to me he wants to be more of a Chris Paul type PG long term instead of a Curry/Kyrie type. His craftiness and inventiveness is so underrated and it's not a coincidence Bogi, and Capella are suddenly having career years the first year they played with him"
"OKC 2019 - 2020 Season  Chris Paul:  * 17.6 PPG on 48.9% / 36.5% / 90.7% * \~67.8% TS in the clutch * 6.7 assists, 5.0 rebounds, 1.2 steals * 1 tradable contract  Danilo Gallinari   * 18.7 PPG on 43.8% / 40.5% / 89.3% * 5.2 rebounds"
"It's 2021, Warriors fans have gotten the pleasure of seeing their team win **3 rings** and watching their MVP ball out year after year.  Meanwhile /u/byrockets is desperately screeching on /r/nba about how if his aunt had balls she'd be his uncle, like some curbside prophet to anyone who will listen.   ""*Why does everyone just laugh at me?! Can't they tell that I'm spreading the good word?!""*  When his thankless work on /r/nba for the day is done, he climbs back into bed, life devoid of any other purpose, to furiously masturbate to his well worn posters of James Harden and Chris Paul.  *""Don't worry James, Chris. In my heart we won the championship!"" UGHGHHH*.   *""Damn, gotta remind mum to change the sheets again""*"
"Wade was never 2nd in MVP voting either though. He was also 3rd once, and fifth once. Chris Paul has a much better case of coming really close without winning it among modern players."
"chris paul just can't beat curry :|  and wtf did we do to Wiggins anway, man just went off on us like we were OKC"
"Kobe was robbed zero times and he robbed either Chris Paul or Lebron, depending on who you favor, for his sole MVP award."
"Jokic better... Embiid better..  Luka  better... Giannis better... Westbrook better... Chris Paul better..  Orange Julius better...  Dame better...  Steph better..  Booker better.. Rudy Gobert better... Kawhi better.. Kyrie better... Donovan Mitchell better.. Jimmy Butler better..      I mean, you're so confused you listed KD who is an even more injury prone. almost washed up mega star..      LMAO."
"Tony Parker was 5th that year, behind LeBron, Durant, Chris Paul, and Kobe Bryant. LeBron led with 1074 weighted votes, Durant 889, Paul with 385, Kobe with 352, and Parker with 331.  So it was really only a two-man race."

"Yea he’s no Chris Paul, what a midget that guy is  -someone who’s 5’11”"
"I was with you until Carmelo won in 2013.  He had 1 first place vote. Durant already won, Chris Paul already won, Tony Parker already won, Tim Duncan already won.  I'd give the nod to James Harden that year, bumping Melo out.  Then 2018 becomes Anthony Davis."
"The last thing they really need is another young player; they need to get a veteran to get them over the hump.  Add a guy like Jimmy Butler or Chris Paul to this team next season and they'd F around and be a home court team.  Somebody gotta hold the young guys they got now accountable, and be able to take over games in the clutch; a rookie isn't gonna do any of that.  Obviously Jimmy or Chris specifically isn't gonna come to this team lol, but somebody LIKE that; not sure what their cap situation is like or who is available."
"Honestly, I'm hoping to see Chris Paul win his ring. CP3 overtook Nash in my favorite players list back in his hornets days"

Hi Chris Paul. Why are you being salty?
"We didn’t build around chris Paul lol, he was the supporting player to our guy. Not everyone can have Durant fall into there laps during an all time high cap spike"
How is Chris Paul going down after being up 3-2 and you barely winning not literally luck?
John Stocktons 3265 career steals. Chris Paul is the only active player even close in 5th place with 2331 steals.
"That was just exceptional ball movement, they played good D. Chris Paul probably didn't expect Looney to pass that quickly, he probably tried to pressure him for a steal or force him to pick it up but you probably don't want to come off the corner every time, keep them thinking"
"Pretty cool on Draymond's part, but since when is a squared-up mid-range jumper ""a tough shot"" for Chris motherfucking Paul?"
And he was up against an impressive Knicks defense. Talen unsuccessfully tried to be Chris Paul but accidentally became Kobe
Highlights from anyone playing Chris Paul in the playoffs
LOL dude the Warriors would crush yall.  Draymond and Steph aren't losing to a team with Chris Paul on it ever again.
most surprising thing tonight was chris paul having three whole turnovers
I live for Chris Paul to lose to Curry
Death. Taxes. Chris Paul getting cucked by Steph Curry
Fuck Chris Paul
Chris Paul acting like he’s having warrior clippers flashbacks
I respect Chris Paul a lot. But I hate him.
chris paul is still so annoying w that shit
"This dude really said Kobe and CP3 had a chance to not work together lmao. Dude you really typed that out and didn’t see how dumb it sounded?   Your opinion doesn’t take into account the carry job he had to do because Nash was hurt and the chemistry issues. If you think Kobe playing all those minutes that season weren’t a direct result of the team sucking and in result caused him to get injuries then you don’t know what you’re taking about.   A super team where a 38 year old Nash played 50 games, Dwight Howard refused to run the pick n roll with Nash, Gasol played 49 games, and Dwight wasn’t healthy all season. But yea let’s not add context to the team. Chris Paul that season played 70 games. Pretty sure he would have prevented Kobe from playing all those minutes do to a lack of another ball handler.   We assume Kobe would not be playing 39 MPG the last 25 games because we would have had CP3 playing and not have Steve Nash who only played 50 games and was never healthy. Like how do you not get that?   I literally asked you why Kobe got injured. You side stepped the question by sayin “he played a highly physical sport”. No shit Sherlock. You can say that about any injury. I asked you to contextualiza why he got injuries and you got butt hurt and refused to answer it.   I told you I don’t go through peoples comments, I still haven’t searched for that comment. All you had to do was say the context or even link the comment but you just refuse to admit that you didn’t want to add context because it would destroy your opinion. And sure buddy I’m the one with low emotional IQ. I’m the one that got mad and lied about it lol.   It’s not rehashing when you are replying. You could have literally linked the comment if you didn’t want to type it out but you wanted to get butt hurt and throw insults. Says a lot about you honestly"
Will have a better legacy than Chris Paul
"I’ve heard that he’s really happy in Phoenix. If the Suns make a run to the Western Conference Finals, then I think he’ll give strong consideration to resign. He’s obviously at the point of his career where he’s accomplished enough to earn himself a first ballot hall of fame bid once he’s eligible, but he hasn’t won a ring yet. Chris Paul doesn’t seem like the type of guy or player to ring chase but he’s certainly earned the right to do so without a bunch of backlash from casuals and haters."
How come Chris Paul ain’t got hair but he still got a hair line
"Yup, Chris Paul is one of the most casually underrated players ever. My hill is that he should have won MVP the year he got 2nd to Kobe.   Dude's just a winning player. Sucks that he probably never gets a ring, but those Rockets were a champion level team that happened to run into the arguable greatest team ever."
Congrats Chris Paul
"No, there is zero difference.  That's why when David West got injured on an ankle breaker by Chris Paul, no one cheered at the time or made any jokes because any player injury of any kind is in no way funny by any fan.  I'm sure these same people were critical of anyone who made any jokes about the incident."
"I can see where Beal is coming from and I think Bazemore shouldn't have made the comment.  That being said, do we never make fun of someone's injury?  When Chris Paul literally broke David West's ankles people were making a lot of jokes and they were kind of hilarious."
Chris Paul is a petulant asshole and I actively hope he never wins a championship.
yep we need a veteran playmaker who can play decent defense. shoulda swung for chris paul last offseason
"I'd imagine it's due to Chris Paul being 36 and his contract expiring after next year. But even then, if Ayton doesn't get suspended for 25 games last year the Suns are probably a playoff team, and with the jumps he and Bridges have made this season the Suns would most likely be a 6-7 seed without Paul. CP3 obviously deserves a ton of credit but the rest of the suns core is very underrated"
"&gt; Prime Chris Paul has very, very few peers in terms of on-court impact.  There are wings and bigs who do the job just fine.   Sure, someone like Harden isn't as good a passer as CP3 but Harden too is much better in his on-court impact.   CP3 can be a great second star to have, you know, alongside the main superstar (like Harden/Lebron/Curry/KD or even AD...)."
I'm okay with Chris Paul never getting a ring. In fact I plain just don't like the dude.
"Harden played with Chris Paul, Russel Westbrook and KD too.  That's 2 MVP's and a top 5 point guard in NBA history.  I don't really know if Harden is better than Wade or not, but Harden had plenty of help in his career."
Lmao what? The only time that key pieces for that team wasn’t injured was in 2014 when the Donald Sterling shit was going on.  Edit: [Proof ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/nba/clippers/.amp/news/chris-paul-says-lob-city-clippers-were-never-lucky)
"I’m pretty skeptical that’s true as having Westbrook properly guard the perimeter and take a simple outlet pass from a center pushes the offense faster than Westbrook getting the rebound himself in the paint and being behind the entire defense. If you have a link showing their offense was better when he got a defensive rebounds vs someone else please post it. I checked and couldn’t find it. There were a bunch of cherry-picked stats over a short sliver of the season I found that showed their offense was better when Westbrook got the rebound, but every offense is significantly better after a defensive rebound. It didn’t show that Westbrook getting that rebound vs a center was better.  And him playing in the paint and sagging way off his guy absolutely hurt their defense. Westbrook has had some of the worst defensive numbers in the league according to things like Real Plus/Minus and RAPTOR. If he played proper perimeter defense his teams would be more successful on defense but he’d only get like 6-7 rebounds per game. And even if somehow the strategy of planting Westbrook in the paint is good, then he’s getting triple doubles just because of how his team is using him, not because he’s a better passer than LeBron, Harden and Chris Paul and a better rebounder than Giannis and Jokic."
"Nets, Clippers, Jazz, in that order. Normally I'd say the Suns, too, but Chris Paul deserves to win the ring ""basketball reasons"" stole from him."
6’3” Chris Paul with his pre-knee-injury athleticism is a GOAT tier player.  It’s crazy what he still accomplishes (top five point guard all time) at an honest 5’11” without elite athleticism.
Chris Paul is good at not turning the ball over
Harden and maybe Chris Paul
"It’s not specifically about rings; not having rings is a byproduct of not playing winning basketball...that’s the argument.   In contrast, Chris Paul doesn’t have any rings and also doesn’t average a triple-double, but I’d take CP3 over Russ any day.   I’ll never ever shit on Russ for how much effort and care he puts into his game, but ultimately it’s about winning games and making the guys around you play above their skill set. Russ doesn’t do that on a consistent basis"
"If we're willing to be (very?) charitable to OP, Kemba *might* decline quickly. He's good now, but he just turned 31 and is a relatively small point guard so there's a chance he falls off very quickly, but maybe that happens next year or maybe it happens in 5 years.   Can Kemba have a favorable aging curve like Chris Paul or Kyle Lowry and play well into the second half of his 30s? Sure, it's possible, but the more typical outcome is that under-sized guys drop off pretty fast."
"Actually Rose had terrible body control and that’s why he got injured. Russ in comparison has exquisite body control and recovery.  His problem is his tunnel vision. He’s not the greatest anticipator. Guys like Chris Paul and Lebron can map out exactly what’s going to happen in the next 5-10 seconds if they take a certain action and know the cascading effect of that action. Russ simply does not have this ability. If he wants to pass, he’ll pass with little to not regard to scoring at the expense of missing scoring opportunities. Same Vice versa when he’s looking to score and missing assist and other playmaking opportunities."
"I used to root for a team close to me but then they went away :( I don’t really have just one team that I pull for right now tho. This year I’m rooting for the suns cause I like Chris Paul though, and I’ve been enjoying seeing the Knicks do well lately"
So you think Westbrook has been better than booker gobert and chris Paul ?? Smh my head
"""he's got his shirt untucked that's a delay of game"" - Chris Paul"
"I’m not arguing your point, but CP3 missing 24 games is significant. Harden missed four games. So at best, Chris Paul played 74% of the games harden played. At worst he played in 69% of those hardens games. I just wanted to say that still is a significant amount of games without CP3."
"ALL HE NEEDED FOR HIS LEGACY WAS THAT GAME 7 AGAINST THE ROCKETS IN THE BUBBLE.  That's literally all he needed to cement his legacy. He could've gotten swept by the Lakers in the next round and it wouldn't matter. If Chris Paul got traded to that weird Thunder team, came back and eliminated Harden and Westbrook in the playoffs, his entire career would be recontextualized. And he was so close too. He had the ball at the end of Game 7 with a chance to win it, and he passed up the shot. If Chris Paul hits a game-winner there, suddenly the Rockets' 65-win season (and WCF vs. the Warriors) gets viewed differently. Shit, even the Lob City Clippers get viewed differently. All he had to do was come up clutch in that one moment."
"Yes, but which veteran *actually* matters.  ""Warriors look to Chris Paul as model for James Wiseman’s development"" would be fucking stupid."
"He gets the board because he pushes the pace and attacks before the defense can set, It's all by design.   If he was a terrible passer or played at measured pace like Chris Paul does, he wouldn't get the board.   Westbrook is a hurricane by himself, It's like he's running a full court press on offense. It has nothing to do with stat padding and everything to do with the pressure he puts on defense to recover and get the board."
I think Chris Paul really got his clout when he took the assist title from prime Nash. Then his longevity and solid regular season numbers have also continued to keep him in the best point guard discussion.
"chris paul is the difference between a lower playoff team and a top team for them imo. theyd still be in the playoff hunt with rubio instead, just lower which is what min should be aiming for  as for crowder hes an example of the valuable role player/depth type that they should be looking to add"
"I mean Chris Paul has helped Phoenix a fuck ton and Jae Crowder has helped a little too. Minnesota is definitely playing solid basketball right now but no guarantee it carries over, still need to upgrade parts of the roster."
"He won more than 50 games with the Hornets once, where he had...an all-star PF and some good roleplayers.  &amp;#x200B;  Chris Paul cannot drag a team of g-leaguers to 50 wins. If you don't have 50 wins you are not winning first team all-NBA with FEW exceptions."
"Come on man... everyone here just loves to circlejerk hate. I can’t stand this. Say what you want about him, but Chris Paul is no scrub."
People will say cp3 because it makes them feel they are smarter but there was never a point in his career you saw cp3 and went this guy is thr best player in the league. Westbrook has more success in the playoffs is 2-0 against cp3 has reached the finals and has about the same amount of conference appearances only one less assist tittle and more scoring titles. Cp3 only has the hurr durr he plays for winning going for him that has accomplish very little for him. Westbrook will also have the most Tripoli doubles in history with is more valuable all time than Chris Paul loosing another time in the second round
Question. Do you think Chris Paul is top 5 all time? If so why isn't Stockton? He has literally everything CP3 has including finals appearances (one of which he literally hit a buzzer beater to make)
Stockton was great but that take is so commonly said on here it genuinely infuriates me. As good as Stockton was in his day he has zero argument over Chris Paul.
"Milicic connects with the Slavic population in Northeast Ohio, plays with a totally different mindset, and becomes the greatest player of all time. After a disappointing first season in a more disappointing city, LeBron pushes for a move back to Cleveland. Meanwhile the Cavs trade Carlos Boozer and Ricky Davis to Utah for their 2005 first round pick taking a PG out of Wake Forest by the name of Chris Paul ahead of the Hornets  The lineup is now   Chris Paul Jeff McInnis LeBron James Darko Milicic  Z  The Cavs haven’t lost a game since"
"Idk if it's only bc I watched us beat the Suns last night, but   - Devin Booker: for as much as he hates the double teams in the summer) he's reached a level of superb ability where, like kobe, all the shots he takes are these difficult, contested, on-his-own-pace jump shots that SOMEHOW float in. It's pretty fuckin impressive - Chris Paul: I sound like a total dork but his passes are so fucking beautiful every time. This man is only like 6'0 throwing PERFECT live dribble passes to the weakside while being contained by his own teammate, the other team's guard, and the 7 footer guarding his teammate. And when i say perfect i mean shot pocket every time! AND HE DOESNT EVEN TELEGRAPH IT LIKE A CHUMP!  - Mikal Bridges: Idk how but he makes layups like his contract is based on layups made per game. Long ass arms and he just doesn't seem to EVER miss em (maybe it's the pickup baller in me that's only impressed bc I've missed my fair share of layups)"
"Who is better though, andre Drummond or chris paul? Pretty close"
Russell Westbrook and I'm fucking sick of ya'll acting like it's close. Dude is posting Oscar and Wilt numbers every damn game. Making history every damn game.  And ya'll wanna say Chris Paul cuz you fucking like him and his dumb ass commercials.  It's Russell fucking Westbrook!!
James Paul       Chris Harden
the closest player right now is chris paul.   chris paul would have to average his career high in assists until he's 41 years old (6 more years) to break stockton's record.
"Lol the first part of this is just inaccurate. Westbrook is 16th in the league in usage. Jokic is 20th and is a whooping 1% lower at 29.4 vs 30.4. The difference between Westbrook and the player with the highest usage (Luka) is six times the difference between him and Westbrook. Stars under Jokic include KAT, Kawhi, Harden, Butler, Chris Paul, DeMar DeRozen.  Also Jokic has more touches per game than Westbrook, more touches in the paint with a lower percentage of passing from there. He also has more secondary assists and potential assists per game than Jokic.   None of this to say Jokic isn’t amazing. But don’t criticize Westbrook for numbers when they’re basically the same as Jokic’s."
"I'm about to list the win share totals on the season for all the major candidates (in my eyes) for All-NBA in the guard position, try to guess which one is Westbrook without clicking on the names.  9.5 &gt;!Dame!&lt;  8.8 &gt;!Curry!&lt;  8.6 &gt;!Chris Paul!&lt;  7.7 &gt;!Luka!&lt;  7.0 &gt;!Kyrie!&lt;  6.6 &gt;!Harden!&lt;  6.0 &gt;!Bradley Beal!&lt;  3.3 &gt;!Westbrook!&lt;"
"If we end up out, I’m absolutely rooting for Phoenix. Chris Paul worked so hard to get this close."
"He’s right in that it was dumb to not stagger the season better.   But he’s wrong in that Embiid and Davis are always hurt, Kawhi bumped his knee, Kyrie landed wrong, Lebron almost dies every game, and Chris Paul has COVID."
Nah it just means the players are soft. It’s not the coaches job to be your friend. Gentrys style may work on the suns but they also have a great leader in Chris Paul who keeps the players disciplined and in check. Ingram has never made it to the playoffs so he doesn’t have room to complain about having a coaching style too hard. Especially if he wants to reach his potential
Chris Paul is definitely the best player for the Suns
You're gonna have a tough time convincing me the Nets are looking like the future champs if Chris Paul only misses a game.
"FWIW, Suns bench had the [best net rating](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced/?sort=NET_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;StarterBench=Bench) in the entire league last year which of course isn't perfect but a good reflection on how good and deep a bench is. Many Suns fans have a curious optimism on how E'Twuan Moore and Langston Galloway will perform. Of course... maybe not optimistic enough to wish it for more than the 1 or 2 games before Chris Paul comes back."
Did LeBron not load manage? Did Kawhi not load manage? Were Chris Paul and Kyrie Irving’s injuires not contact injuries? Did Harden not take 15% of the season off to go to the club?  Jaylen Brown hurt is hand. Anthony Davis always picks up injuries. Joel Embiid always picks up injuries.   Injuries are a reality.
"Lol Chris Paul has been roasting Rudy gobert his whole career, that’s why he dominated em in Houston and why we swept them this year"
If bucks had traded for Chris Paul instead of Jrue I don’t see how they don’t win if Paul stays healthy
Chris paul: is vaccinated and just had terrible luck once again  Everyone: hE's jUsT a DUmbAsS fOR nOt GeTtiNg tHE vACcINe!!!  You idiots do know that the vaccine is literally just a smaller less lethal version of covid to help decrease its effect?   It's not a fucking bug repellent for viruses you put on to never get it.
"I agree with you generally - the NFL has a 17th game because it has hundreds and hundreds of random nobodies who benefit from a 17th check and far outnumber the players who don't need that extra paycheck and voted against another game of wear and tear.  However...Chris Paul being greedy is a major reason why the Players' Association rejected cap smoothing measures (gotta let star players get that extra $5 mil!) and created the massive cap spike that, among other things, meant the Warriors could sign Durant."
Ya I thought I remember that the guy im thinking of was allowed to play pretty quickly.  Which i bet happens with Chris Paul
"&gt;the hookshot is a lost art. same with the mid range Jumper (especially the post fade that mj made a living on, that kobe inherited).   Kawhi jokic Chris Paul DeMar embiid tatum Anthony Davis Durant   &gt;same with runner layups/floaters.   Trae young Morant harden kyrie   U just making shit up"
Being able to do things besides run and dunk on offense.   Chris Paul is skilled. James Harden is skilled. Khris Middleton is skilled. Embiid is skilled.   Giannis is just insanely athletic (and tall) with basic guard skills. If he was as skilled on the offensive end as any of the other guys listed he’d be the best player in the world without a doubt.  It’s also the reason IMO why defense shouldn’t dictate  or influence MVP candidacy as much as offense bc you see how useless individual defense can become against individual offense in the playoffs. Limited offensive games get exposed in the playoffs.
If CP3 and his teammates/staff weren't all vaccinated.... it likely wouldn't just be Chris Paul that is out with COVID. This could have ripped through the locker room over the next few weeks.   The vaccinations might be what ends up saving their season.
"&gt;There are players that we know to lead teams very well. Jimmy, Chris Paul, and LeBron are good examples.  Sure, but just because we know some guys can lead teams well doesn't mean we can objectively compare how good leaders they are.   &gt;Tatum has the deep playoff runs but he didn't do them as the leader of his team. He was a rookie for his first one, and his team entirely lacked lategame execution in the other, if we're looking at his two ECF berths, just because you're a team's best player doesnt mean you're leading the team  Just because he was a rookie in the first one doesn't mean he wasn't a leader on that team. He was the go-to guy when they needed a bucket and just as important to that run as Horford, Brown, Smart, and Terry. The second deep run did lack late-game execution, so that is a valid point.  &gt;Jimmy was the Heat's best player through 3 of the 4 series, with Bam being our best player due to the matchup with the Celtics. Jimmy was the one hitting the clutch shots down the stretch in Milwaukee, he set the tone of the game in Indiana, and obviously with the finals. I watched every game of our playoff run, Dragic was an amazing scorer for us but he wasn't our best player for any of our series'.  Dragic had better stats in that first series and you can make a really good argument he was better than Jimmy in that series, even if you do want to lean Jimmy. In comparison with Tatum, there isn't a single series last playoffs when he wasn't the best player.  &gt;Id argue that Monty Williams spearheaded the turnaround in the bubble, and Chris Paul completed it this year.  Monty for sure played a big part in it and CP3 did too, but Booker was just as much a part of that as they were and if that isn't evident to you from how Book has played all year and especially in the playoffs, I don't know what to tell you.  &gt;Boston's problem is on court leadership. I've watched more Celtics games this season than any team but the Heat and Lakers, and you guys fall apart at the end of games. That shows the lack of a steadying presence from a leader.  So Tatum actually led the league in 4th quarter scoring on 48/48/88 splits and continued that trend in the playoffs on 45/50/87 splits. Late game execution was a problem for last year's Celtics but it was not nearly as much of an issue this year. The problem was more so slow starts and having to play from behind all game long.   You're basing your argument on leadership too much around how you feel, and while it is perfectly fine to feel like Jimmy Butler is an excellent leader, you cannot use that as an objective, unbiased argument.   If we were playing by those rules, I would tell you that in my opinion, an objectively good leader wouldn't get outscored by Bryn Forbes in the process of being swept in the first round by a team that they had beaten less than a year ago and is currently being exposed to have no legitimate offensive system, especially after talking a big deal about being able to take over and carry once the playoffs come around. Good leaders don't objectively do that, do they?"
Andre Iguodala&gt;Chris Paul confirmed
"You are still susceptible to getting COVID even when vaccinated. Your symptoms will be a lot easier to deal with, or you could be completely asymptomatic, which it seems Chris Paul was/is."
"Ah and you blamed Chris Paul for getting covid earlier, congrats on being a lame"
"&gt;Paul had received a Pfizer vaccine in February, Gambadoro adds.   Per Gambadoro's article.   https://arizonasports.com/story/2691223/suns-chris-paul-tests-positive-covid-19-health-safety-protocols/"
"And this might save their season, as it's pretty unlikely that CP3 gave it to others on the team who would then also have to sit out.  So good on Chris Paul, and good on the rest of the Suns.  You did the right thing and the smart thing, and that might limit the damage done by some horrible luck."
"&gt; How do you expect anyone to believe a word you say when the current MVP and the potential second-place MVP are both the same size as Giannis but yet possess vastly superior skill in and outside the paint.  I reverse the question.   How do you expect for anyone to take you seriously if you think that both Jokic and Embiid are more of inside scorers than Giannis? They literally aren't. They are better shooters and have more moves from 5ft out. They are not more skilled than him around the basket , not even close, Giannis' finishing ability if of way higher quality. He is the only volume scorer from 5ft in (on incredible efficiency no less) since Shaq, let that sink in.  Also Jokic is not skilled at all defensively , he is part of the season that Chris Paul had a wild series and they got swept. Him being a liability in one of the most important parts of the court (the box in the defensive end) would always hold him back and his team.  &gt; You can perhaps say they play like one but saying they are one is lying to yourself, which you seem to be doing a lot of.  I say he plays like one because I have actually seen what championship calliber bigs in the past would offer. Volume inside scoring and great defense. Both of which Giannis (and noone else currently) is adept at."
"Also going against the 2nd strongest curse behind Chris Paul not being given anything good in the Wcf curse, that’s the main issue rn for PG (this is a bit)"
"This thread might not realize this but **you can get covid despite being vaccinated**  How is this not common knowledge by now?  The vaccines protect to 99.999% against severe cases, but depending on the vaccine type you still have a notable chance of catching the virus when you're exposed to it. Even if it's just 5% Chris Paul could have easily been that one case out of twenty.  That means he cannot play until he's no longer contageous. Even if he feels completely healthy."
Of course.. Chris Paul can't ever catch a break in the Playoffs eh
"Wait, what else happened? The whole Chris Paul thing?"
How does Jalen know Chris Paul is vaccinated when no one else is reporting it?
"I hope he is vacinated that means nothing  major will happen. All I am saying is acording to the ""sources"" he had the pfizer vacine which has 95% efficency .If the whole squad got exposed statistically it fits, I just find it a huge coincidence that the one positive  is Chris Paul the one on the sun's most likely to share LeBron's beliefs on vaccination"
"The joke is Chris Paul did everything right, he's literally fully vaccinated and likely advocated for all his teammates to get vaccinated too."
"There are players that we know to lead teams very well. Jimmy, Chris Paul, and LeBron are good examples.  Tatum has the deep playoff runs but he didn't do them as the leader of his team. He was a rookie for his first one, and his team entirely lacked lategame execution in the other, if we're looking at his two ECF berths, just because you're a team's best player doesnt mean you're leading the team   Jimmy was the Heat's best player through 3 of the 4 series, with Bam being our best player due to the matchup with the Celtics.

Apparently he chose to take the readily available Pfizer vaccine in Feb https://arizonasports.com/story/2691223/suns-chris-paul-tests-positive-covid-19-health-safety-protocols/
Suns (assuming Chris Paul doesn't miss any games). We're missing a starter.
"In the meantime how about we bring out Alfonso Ribeiro, aka the NEW Chris Paul 😆"
"chris paul.  but people gotta be safe.  Even if you're vaccinated, you're can still get it and that means NOT playing games....during the playoffs."
Yeahhhhhh never been happy about another mans injury but Kawhi out and Chris Paul out the Jazz might have a real shot!
"we were right.  Vaccinated or not, you can still get covid.  And that enters you into protocol.  Look at Chris Paul now."
catching covid right before the western conference finals after his performance thus far while being vaccinated is the most chris paul shit ever. sure in the grand scheme of things he’s lucky no one is denying that. but as far as in the NBA playoffs throughout his career it seems like luck always finds a way to not be in his favor.
Chris Paul took the vaccine and caught covid…. Saved you a few years.
"Teams where 85% of players and staff are vaccinated have relaxed COVID rules, practices without masks, allowed to hold team events, meals on flights, less testing etc., so it's possible the whole team could be exposed to positive person at the same time, but it's not necessary for the odds to still hold. It's likely that a number of players have been exposed to a COVID positive person since getting vaccinated, even if it's not the same positive person as Chris Paul was in contact with."
"Embiid, Mitchell, Conley, Chris Paul, LeBron, AD, Kyrie, Harden, Kawhi, Murray  That's at least 10 stars that aren't 100% this post season due to injuries. Now the playoffs are a shittier product because of the mismanagement of the regular season and offseason. Thanks Adam Silver."
Chris Paul will play game 1.   There is some serious NBA illuminati shit that will go down and like many of the other inexplicable shit that we've seen over the years will happen again.
"My account is just as old as yours, and doing fine, thanks. In this same fucking thread I've been called racist as well, I'm gonna chalk this up to this subreddit being ridiculous today.  If you want to think that it's more likely for Chris Paul to be fully vaccinated, and following all NBA restrictions and still pick up COVID than it is for him to simply not be vaccinated, then that's you taking that leap of faith. We'll see how long he's out or if he comes out and comments on it. I have no problem being wrong if he is indeed one of the most unfortunate people on the planet"
whichever religion chris paul practices is clearly the wrong one
Where’s that guy from earlier talking shit about Chris Paul being anti vax!?? Where you at
It's being reported that Chris Paul got the Pfizer vaccine.
"Hijacking the top comment:  A quick explanation on how the vaccine works. It doesn't actually    prevent you from getting infected, it boosts your defence against the    virus, getting rid of it faster and preventing symptoms. Since Chris    Paul is vaccinated and NBA players need two negative tests to resume    play, I'd say it is possible that CP could play next game."
I'm starting to think Chris Paul was literal Adolf Hitler in a past life and karma is kicking his ass.
"A quick explanation on how the vaccine works. It doesn't actually prevent you from getting infected, it boosts your defence against the virus, getting rid of it faster and preventing symptoms.

Devastating blow to people hoping Chris Paul got Covid
Based on those 12% odds if the entire vaccinated roster was exposed than you would expect 1+ person to still catch COVID … but still crazy unlucky for Chris Paul. At least he will probably have mild or no symptoms
"There was a report awhile back that they had a issue with a lot people getting the first one but not following up for the second one. I've talked to people irl that were afraid of getting the second one due to people having bad reactions and thinking ""one should be enough for me"".   I think Chris Paul would be smarter than that but my god the bad luck he has to have to get both shots and still catch it."
Chris Paul ain’t injured...
CHRIS PAUL you did not wait your ENTIRE CAREER for the best chance to get an NBA championship.. for THIS!
&gt;the vaccine is keeping you out of the hospital  Like Chris Paul would be at risk of hospitalization even if he wasn’t vaccinated lol Reddit doesn’t understand how rare hospitalization is for covid for people under 50
"&gt;2015: Blew 3-1 Lead to the Rockets in second round.  It would help to provide context that Chris Paul was in fact nursing a [hamstring injury](https://www.si.com/nba/2015/05/04/los-angeles-clippers-chris-paul-hamstring-injury) during this series and was never 100%, and he reaggravated the injury in Game 7."
"I'm just saying, with the NBA rule that says players don't have to sit out after being exposed to COVID if they're vaccinated, along with Chris Paul saying getting jabbed is your own choice, it's not looking like he's vaccinated.  I hope I'm wrong though"
"cause the phrasing puts it on chris paul like as if he's our here causing his own bad luck. of course CP has bad luck but if you kept getting unlucky breaks and someone straight up says it's your fault, that would rub anyone the wrong way. have some empathy and imagine how annoying it would be to be in chris Paul's shoes and someone literally says you ain't loving right that's why you are getting fucked up. its insensitive as fuck"
I went back and looked. The original article linked with the espn phone notification has been removed. The new article does not confirm he is vaccinated.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31644110/phoenix-suns-chris-paul-indefinitely-placed-nba-health-safety-protocols%3fplatform=amp
"The most worrisome thing about Harden's play yesterday isn't just his limited mobility, it's the fact that he's playing on a clearly un-healed hamstring injury, which means it's probably just a matter of time before he re-injures it (look at how he already re-injured it in Game 1 after a prior injury, or how Mike Conley re-injured his as well). A hamstring injury just takes time and rest to heal, and Harden instead is valiantly gutting it out and putting his body on the line. But as we saw in Game 1, it doesn't take much to re-injure it and it's unfortunately probably just a matter of time before he does.   I've said it before but these playoffs fucking suck with all of these injuries. Usually in the postseason we're trying to figure out who the best team is, but now we're just trying to figure out who's going to be healthiest. Maybe Embiid is too limited and Atlanta wins even though at full strength I think Philly is clearly better. Maybe Harden can't go and Milwaukee advances even though full strength Brooklyn is clearly better. Maybe because Kawhi is out the Jazz win, or because Conley is out the Clippers win. Maybe the Suns are in trouble without Chris Paul. And this is to say nothing of the teams that were already eliminated because of injuries.   The playoffs are not supposed to be like this. The NBA (owners and players) really fucked up with that shortened off-season last year and we're seeing the effects right now. And unfortunately this year's off-season is only going to be 2-3 weeks longer than last year's was."
"Chris Paul is said to have been vaccinated.  Chance its a false positive or even a minor infection, the vaccine isn't 100% effective, though it is supposed to help prevent the spread even if you do get infected."
They’re saying Chris Paul can’t play because he tested positive for Covid
"Damn what are the chances, Chris Paul is really cursed"
Getting vaccinated but still catching covid in the playoffs is the most Chris Paul thing I have ever heard
Yeah Giannis honestly seems like the type just to do what the coach tells him to  Someone like Chris Paul would probably be ignoring Bud by now lol
"""Chris Paul is a stupid anti-vax what a trash human LOL""  vs.  ""Don't hate on Chris Paul when you don't know anything""  you: these are the same"
AKA: Chris paul isn't like those classy players
"Chris Paul never stops to wonder why State Farm loves him so much but every time Jake is around, there's a stray ball or a ""new"" Chris Paul or can you just imagine somebody repeatedly trying to steal your identity with a wig and some confidence?"
&gt; I'm not gonna trust Jalen Rose on this lmao.  That's fair  &gt; Unless Chris Paul or his teammates say he's vaccinated I'm just gonna assume he's not  That's not
"I don't like our chances against the Sun's. Chris Paul may be out for a few weeks, but we would still need to finish up our series, which will take the better part of a week. Gives us another week for our hobbling superstar to try to sweep the sun's before Paul comes back. I love the Jazz, but I just don't see it."
Jalen Rose: Chris Paul is indeed vaccinated.  Jay Williams: Chris Paul walked up to me in the club and whipped out his vaccination cards for both Moderna &amp; Pfizer vaccines. But he also said fuck the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine and don’t compare him to Giannis either.
Seriously. The Suns might be the favorites to win the title at this point and Chris Paul catches COVID?
"If Chris Paul ends up out extended time, I'd prefer the Suns play the Clippers sans Kwahi Leonard. Selfish... Also true"
"It applied equally to him as well. He was at an event where everyone was either vaccinated or had tested negative so he was not exposed to anyone, and he himself must have tested negative, as they regularly test everyone.   People need to remember that the NBA doesn't suspend people for violating Covid protocols, they put someone in the health and safety protocols if they have been exposed or test positive just to make sure they don't spread it to anyone else. It's not a punitive measure, it's just simply a pragmatic method of trying to prevent any spread.   If LeBron wasn't infected and hadn't been exposed and continued to test negative then there was no reason to isolate him. Whatever is going on with Chris Paul is not a suspension, it's a reaction to whatever his test results were or contact tracing. That's it."
"Yep, being vaccinated makes covid a mild illness for healthy people. The fact that Chris Paul was smart enough to get vaccinated is keeping the Suns in title contention."
"Suns seem fine, assuming what they're saying about Chris Paul likely being back soon are true.  Also every ~~other~~ team is injured. We're missing a starter."
"But they can still transmit it and get it, just like Chris Paul got it."
I assume they were all vaccinated and it didnt affect them just Chris paul
"People call LeBron “Thanos” but really, Chris Paul is comics Thanos, always self-sabotaging"
sucks because i just want the best for chris paul. he can’t catch a break
lmao Chris Paul fucking would. This dude is cursed.
"So the Clippers curse is real, Chris Paul has some kind of horrible voodoo magic from hitting all those people in the balls, this shit is just crazy, whoever wins this Championship is going to be looked at as even less credible than the 2015 Warriors were 😭😭😭"
Rondo or Chris Paul we talking bout?
"I for one respect Chris Paul, and see him as the type of person to be most likely to get vaccinated. He’s on the Suns, hasn’t touched the Finals, and is desperate to win. No way he risks his team by being LeAntiVax"
"""Chris Paul, who is a close, personal friend, and by that I mean someone who I've seen play basketball on television."""
Is this what jalen rose is saying or Chris Paul? Jalen Rose isn't what I would call reliable... if Chris Paul says he is then I'll resend my response
Chris Paul has gotta be the unluckiest motherfucker in the NBA
I get that point but does that mean we should mandate the vaccine? I don’t like the idea of governments having power to force people to inject things into their body.   If not the other answer would be social pressure which I think is ok but I think the way people do it is wrong. Shaming shouldn’t be the answer. All shaming does is create a greater divide and it’s not convincing any skeptical person. People should look to educate because often antivax sentiments come from ignorance.   But people love to hop of hate wagons so people’s first instinct about Chris Paul was to shame him (even though it later comes out he was vaccinated)
Idk who Gambo is but it sounds like he’s reliable as a Chris Paul jump shot  [let it rain!](https://youtu.be/4BTmTVh40Co)
Idk what to tell you If you’re waiting for Chris Paul to tell you to get vaccinated against a deadly disease
Chris Paul is about to live at CVS for the next 7 days. That dude should be getting COVID tests every hour on the hour until he gets 2 negatives lol
What the hell is going on? Kwahi and Chris Paul out for an indefinite amount of time?  Is the Bucks vs Nets the only NBA Finals type of series we will see because everyone else is dropping like flies.
I'm a Lakers fan but I'm rooting for Chris Paul he needs this chip and I've always loved his game
I think the problem is it's mostly okay for vaccinated people since there's a high chance you'll be asymptomatic once you get it but it just sucks for those who work in a high density environment like Chris Paul
"This is why the owners love the players unions.   The players, in a direct democracy, cannot properly advocate for themselves as a class, because the bench guys will do whatever the owners say since they need to get paid. They can't afford to vote for a lockout. NBPA needs to just say ""we elected Chris Paul and Jaylen Brown as our reps, we trust them to make the decisions"", but until then, the players as a whole will keep getting shafted."
"&gt;Chris Paul on getting vaccinated: ""I think all of these situations are personal-type decisions."" Says they'll keep talking about it in the NBPA but doesn't see any kind of mandate coming"
when were you when Chris Paul COVID?  i was sat at home drinking coffee and get text   ‘Paul is positive’  ‘no’
And Chris Paul is out indefinitely sooo all teams have shit going for them.
Real talk IF Chris Paul can get over the COVID situation in the next 4-7 days the west is wide open for PHX.  Out of all the injury issues in the West theirs is the easiest to overcome.
I brought up a lot of injuries that’s the point   You can’t be woe is me right now Chris Paul is maybe going to miss a couple games with NO injury where every other team left is playing through injury or has players sitting  Injuries to the lower body hit two fold. The player also can’t do cardio or be in game shape while they are out. Meanwhile Paul is basically getting time off to rest.
" The 12 man team will probably be: Steph curry, Damian lillard, lebron james, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis as the starters.             Kyrie Irving, James harden, Paul George, kawhi Leonard, Zion Williamson/bam adebayo off the bench.             Chris Paul, Bradley Beal Jason Tatum to round out the roster. I don’t think Chris really belongs here, but I think he’ll make it anyway because of his locker room presence and reputation. Tatum can be swapped out for a lot of players here, but he’s my pick to make it."
"I kinda want to see a team of dudes above 30 make a run at the Gold. If that's 12, that would be:  F LeBron James  F Draymond Green  F Jimmy Butler  F Gordon Hayward (he'll be 30 in a few days)  F Kevin Durant   G Chris Paul  G James Harden  G Russell Westbrook  G Stephen Curry  G Mike Conley  C DeAndre Jordan  F/C Blake Griffin  that'd be cool"
"For new people, I’d recommend   Hornets (they’re a fun young core team).   Nets (arguably the best 3 players at their position - KD, Harden and Kyrie).  Lakers ( appreciate Bron before he retires, and once AD is back, they’re favorites)   Warriors ( just watch Curry, anything else is a plus. It’s beautiful watching Curry play)   Suns ( if you wish to watch some old school, slow down basketball. Watching Chris Paul orchestrate along with Booker and the rest of the supporting cast is amazing)."
Mitch didn’t get a lot of high draft picks during his Lakers tenure but he has a very good track record.  He’s a really good GM who’s getting a lot of bad rap because of how it ended in LA. Around 17 years as GM and signed/traded for these names but is mostly remembered for Deng and Mosgov contracts:  Karl Malone Gary Payton Andrew Bynum Trevor Ariza Pau Gasol Ron Artest Chris Paul Steve Nash Dwight Howard
"What did we do to Lamar Odom? Please enlighten me. He was part of a blockbuster trade that was completed, reported on television across major media outlets, and then vetoed publicly. Something that has never happened before or after in league history. Lamar got his feelings extra hurt feeling that he was untouchable for some reason despite being our 4th best player AND flaming out in the previous postseason. Unlike Pau Gasol, who was an even bigger piece in the trade, he wasn't willing to work through it professionally and [requested a trade not long afterwards](https://www.espn.com/los-angeles/nba/story/_/id/7341952/los-angeles-lakers-lamar-odom-dealt-dallas-mavericks-asking-trade):  &gt; EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Los Angeles Lakers forward Lamar Odom, so hurt by being included in a three-team trade for Chris Paul that was vetoed by the NBA last week, finally was dealt on Sunday, going to the Dallas Mavericks for an $8.9 million trade exception, as well as a protected first-round pick.  &gt; The Lakers also threw in a 2012 second-round draft pick in the deal, which came **two days after Odom requested a trade**, according to a Lakers team source.   Get out of here with this whataboutism schtick. I've seen this wHaT aBoUt oDoM thing brought up way too often by Celtics fans trying to deflect from how Ainge did IT dirty. They're not the same. Two completely different situations."
Chris Paul is way too low....
My favorite NBA fun fact is that Ramon Sessions has better career highs in points and assists (44 and 24) than Chris Paul (43 and 21).
"When they were fully healthy, of course. Take away Chris Paul and not so much."
Chris Paul?
My point is basic stats alone show lowry should be ahead of ben simmons fox etc. He should be just behind chris paul in terms of pure pgs. Lebron cp3 harden dame luka lowry in general list of top pgs
"**TEAM SPACEWEEGEE**  A star-studded (literally) lineup enters the season with some high hopes for a title. In fact, Cliff Paul from StateFarm may be in a position to win a title before Chris Paul himself given all the talent on the roster.  Immediately, things click. Cliff Paul is exactly the type of helpful assist man you'd want to set up his talented teammates like Jesus Shuttlesworth and Mantis. All 3 make the All-Star game, with Mantis and Jesus averaging near 30 points a game and the team racing out to a 40-6 record at the All-Star break.  The group ends the year with the # 1 seed out East. They crush Charlotte 4-0 in round one, and beat Philadelphia 4-0 in round two. Brooklyn provides some resistance in the ECF given James Harden's bully ball on older Uncle Drew, but that's exactly when the team's secret weapon comes into play. Kazaam the genie has saved up his magic for the right time, and finally EXPLODES with a monster 100 pt 100 Reb game.   Now with an unfair / black magic advantage, the team cruises to... THE NBA TITLE!  CONGRATS!!"
"Steph is more of a sg tbh. Best pg in the league is lebron and then chris paul, then dame and luka and lowry imo if we talking who are actually pgs."
"No he’s certainly not better than Chris Paul. I’m saying that like Chris Paul, he isn’t a flashy stat sheet guy, but he contributes to winning so much more than other guys which is ultimately the goal of basketball.  I’d for sure have him over Jamal Murray and DeAaron Fox."
We got kg or Chris paul
So he’s better than Chris Paul? Who exactly should he be higher than on this list?
What if Chris Paul played for the Lakers? There's so much dominoes to it.
What if Chris Paul is traded to the lakers. Smh
"Chris Paul is worse than Magic, Curry, and Robinson, no argument. Many/most people would consider IT, Nash, and Stockton better as well.   West was also unquestionably better, but he was more of a combo guard."
Can’t think of a single one but boy is that Chris Paul fellow pretty good
What if Chris Paul wasn’t overrated and won a chip
"Pelicans with Zion, AD, Chris Paul, Buddy Heild would be a pretty solid place to start"
And if you’re trying to pretend you’d rather have Steve Nash than Chris Paul you’ve lost your mind
No order btw  1. LeBron James 2. Kawhi Leonard 3. Anthony Davis 4. James Harden 5. Kevin Durant 6. Stephen Curry 7. Kyrie Irving 8. Paul  George 9. Damian Lillard 10. Joel Embiid 11. Nikola Jokic 12. Luka Doncic 13. Zion Williamson (yes that's right) 14. Chris Paul 15. Giannis  16. Rudy Gobert 17. Donovan Mitchell 18. Jimmy Butler 19. Jaylen Brown 20. Ben Simmons  maybe a healthy KP top 25
Magic and Curry are the only point guards in history more impactful than Chris Paul. And Nash is around the same level as CP3. So I have him at 3rd or 4th.
Stockton is so overrated man. Chris Paul is easily better.
Uh I guess he does but not sure what that has to do with me saying he will turn into a slightly worse Chris Paul
I mean if lamelo turns into Chris Paul but slightly less efficient and slightly worse defence hornets won the draft  Chris is my second favourite pg currently playing Rubio is still my favourite dude is just theost fun point guard to watch  But yeah let's hope lamelo turns into one of them (as in rubio pre injury not post injury)
Lamelo probably won't He might turn into a Chris Paul He won't end up being lebron James good
NGL I would fucking LAUGH if deandre jordan AND blake griffin get a ring and chris paul doesn't.
Blake Griffin was never really seen as the second coming of lebron Or a white harden  Everyone knew gruff was just a good player who got made better from Chris Paul
There’s a difference between saying “if Chris Paul was healthy” and “they deserved to lose” you look like a fucking clown rn
"Dame is a superstar, multimillionaire, has a great following in Oregon because he’s great and loyal  Every season he knows he will put great stats, he will play hard every game, and all of us respect him. How many do you know actually hate Dame?  So for the now he’s great, but how will future fans remember him? I think he’s gonna be a forgotten star. Deron Williams was a beast, often compared to Chris Paul, who’s a Point God. He’s often forgotten. Dame and Williams are different players but unless Dame wins championships he will probably be forgotten"
"That’s fair, I looked at the wrong stats. At the end of the day, efficiency isn’t the end all beat all for defining who’s better when there’s more factors involved. If it were, chris Paul, James Harden, Bob Pettit, David Robinson and Anthony Davis would all be widely considered too 10 players of all time."
"What help are we suppose to include for harden? 2018? Chris Paul missed the last 2 games, they would have won. 2020? 2017? Which year do we use  All those rockets players were much worse on defense then the raptors players. Joel embiid, phillys best player, was locked up by gasol. Chris Paul stats are also inflated by game 6, games 1-5 he was absolutely abysmal and couldn’t hit or generate any points.  Also, in the 2019 finals, kawhis teammates stepped up tremendously"
"I always thought his efficiency was severely hampered by the fact that almost every single one of his attempts out of the half court was contested. This is because the 76ers never paired a legit 2nd option with him. I mean, here were his offensive-minded second options with the 76ers:  Bum knees Chris Webber  Petulant Jerry Stackhouse  Past his prime Glenn “Big Dog” Robinson  Larry Hughes before he was good  Aaron McKie   Keith Van Horn  Matt Harpring  Old Ass Derrick Coleman  Once he got to Denver, he was slightly more efficient because Melo attracted enough attention for Iverson to properly space.   If the Sixers draft Paul Pierce or Dirk instead of frickin Larry Hughes, we’re looking at a different Iverson who is able to get a couple open looks per game."
Multiple teams like what? 2018 they had a good team and lost because Chris Paul couldn’t get on the floor. What other year?
Check what dwight howard did against andrew bogut when the rockets matched up in 15 and 16  Chris Paul was great in 2018 then got injured and we lost. In 2019 he had the worst season of his career and played like ass games 1-5 against gsw   Then russ put ups 17/4 on 40% TS  In the playoffs. Anything else?
"Harden didn’t choke shit, he was without chris Paul for game 7 against 4 allstars. You act like Wade is a god for winning a rigged series against the mavs when harden was up 3-2 to the goat team.   Hardens playoff stats are also better then wades  MVP is a individual award. Harden has 1 and 3 runner ups."
"You’re right Harden only had a HOF PG in Chris Paul, surrounded by numerous capable three point shooters(Gordon, House, Tucker) and one of the best lob threats in the entire league.  Poor Harden"
"Chris Paul. I hate most foul drawing behavior but I seem to be in the minority in thinking that the stop in front of the trailing defender is actually “okay.” As strategy it warns defenders not to trail so close which is a pretty big advantage for the ball handler, but on a practical level you can’t make a rule telling a ball handler he can’t stay in place whenever he wants. Why is he forced to continue going forward just because someone is behind him?"
Jim harden played with prime Dwight and didn’t anything. Also played with Chris Paul and Westbrook. Stop making excuses for Him
"Let’s see James harden has played with Dwight howard, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook. All future hall of famers and dude has had mind blowing terrible performances in the playoffs."
"Two words for ya, Steve Nash and Chris Paul. Must see TV."
"Even if he's fully healthy there are definitely 15 players better  LeBron, KD, Steph, harden, Kawhi, Giannis, Doncic, Jokic, embiid, Lillard, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen brown, Bradley Beal, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Ben Simmons, Booker"
"How many MVPs has Wade won? How many 1st team all NBAs does Wade have? Scoring titles? Harden has been top 2 in MVP 4 times, Wade has made 2 1st teams.   Harden has 3 scoring titles, Wade has 1.   Like, maybe let’s say the MVP versus the finals MVP is a wash. Harden has still had the longer and better peak.  Also, harden has never played with prime Lebron James. He’s played with a past his prime Dwight Howard, a past his prime Chris Paul, and past his prime Westbrook, and for a lot of that time he was going up against one of the greatest dynasties ever."
"&gt;Lowry, Marcus Smart, Chris Paul, Pat Bev  One of these is not like the others"
"PHO would actually really benefit from having a post-up threat over than Ayton (also could be a mentor ie. Chris Paul)  BOS has no use for Aldridge. He’s negative defensively and they don’t need more bigs.  MIA would be cool, as a bigger Jae Crowder on offense. Although I don’t Aldridge is *thaaat* much better than Olynyk right now, especially not on that contract.  DEN needs defense, they’re set offensively. No need to get someone who’s just gonna take minutes away form Millsap, their 2nd best defender."
"Both Chris Paul playoff years in Houston he was less efficient than Shaqs 06 playoff run, not to mention his injury in 2018 which prevented him from playing at all, while Shaq played every game.   2018 CP3 ts%: .565  2019 CP3 TS%: .557"
"I think they mean players like Lowry, Marcus Smart, Chris Paul, Pat Bev. are especially polarizing. When you play against them, they're floppers, they talk to the refs too much, they're too aggressive, etc.    But when they're on your team, you love those things because they're helping you win."
So should Chris Paul be an MVP candidate too?
That’s dumb as hell. Chris Paul is definitely greatness to me and so is Barkley and malone
In what universe is Chris Paul overrated
I do not understand lists that have Chris Paul above James Harden.  Harden shouldn't be in the top 25 but he's a lot closer to Barkley than CP3 is.
LeOldManJames can't keep up with Chris Paul
"Chris Paul and Pau Gasol combined would be OP, gimme that."
"Eighteen years later, in the 2021 All-Star Game, LeBron put up 4 points 2 rebounds 4 assists and Chris Paul had 16 assists lol"
"LeBron, Curry, KD, Harden, Kawhi, Chris Paul, Dwyane Wade, Duncan, Giannis, Dirk, Kobe  No particular order, that’s just 12 that are better off the top of my head lol. Please don’t make me list 40 players haha."
"You go back and watch Rondo, Russ, and Harden at various points in their careers assist-hunting. Then watch Jokic, LeBron, Chris Paul, the Ball brothers...  There's people who really add value as passers, and there's people that try to get assists."
Yep. His assists remind me more of Russ and Harden and Rondo than they do of Chris Paul or LeBron or Jokic.
"I mean the Rockets gave up a 1st, Harrell, Lou, and Pat Bev to sign a 33 year old Chris Paul to a 4 year 40 million per year deal.  &amp;#x200B;  Obviously, Lowry is tier below, but you really don't think a contender wouldn't sign him to half that money for half the years at the same age? Is Philly's late first really more valuable to them than Lowry would be?"
&gt; is Paul really that important   what? You’re asking if Chris Paul would have been important for us to win game 7?  2 for 13 on threes and clearly robbed of 4 3 point fouls that count as misses and had a made three stripped away  https://youtu.be/aYveyAb6mvU
"Lonzo is clearly an extraterrestrial who escaped Area 51 to crash land on earth and steal the rookie scoring title.  Now, to be fair, Young has taken a couple bad shots that have missed the rim. But for the most part he's been virtually unstoppable this season, and has the third highest field goal percentage in the country at 48.5% behind only Jalen Brunson and Trae. They also haven't won a game since they lost Chris Paul and made Blake Griffin the sacrificial lamb."
"I'm not saying he will or is declining.  Until he shows it, he gets my benefit of the doubt.  I just think it has to be considered if he's getting a 4 or 5 year deal starting at age 34.   I think Chris Paul is a good example for both sides of this equation.  On the one side, people thought he was washed (to varying extents) after the 2019 season, and therefore one of the worst contracts in the league. He was only what? 33, 34? Around then.  On the other hand, he's shown last season and this one to be a valuable player.    Even then, he's 35 rn I believe, and that deal doesn't go til he's 38/39."
"Chris Paul got it at a similar age and while his contract is enormous, he's still a very positive contributor to a winning team. I could easily see steph doing something similar"
*chris paul has entered the chat*
"i don't like embiid and i still don't have arguments against him. i think he's more deserving of it than giannis was the last two seasons tbh, he and jokic have been so dominant but embiid has the seed so...  the only argument i can come up with is that it should go to the player who elevates their team the most regardless of seed. that could arguably be someone like steph, harden, chris paul. without those 3, i don't see the warriors, nets, or suns being as high as they are right now, but i'm also not sure where the sixers would be without joel."
"And it's not simply a matter of ""his shots going in"". When Blake was locked in and his shot wasn't falling he switched up his game.  Vs his rival Chris Paul in their first matchup this season-- Blake when 1/5 from 3, 4/8 from the field, got 6 FTA and had 12 rebounds in a 5 point win over the Suns."
"Team A  Team B has terrible spacing, not to mention Magic isn’t guarding prime Chris Paul or Curry either."
"I never liked Dwight Howard.    I never liked Carmelo Anthony.   I already respected Chris Paul.     I wasn't too familiar with John Wall, but he seems dedicated."
"Best FG% from that distance in last 2 seasons, min. 100 FGA in that distance range:  |Rk|Player|FG|FGA|FG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:| |1|**Richaun Holmes**|81|119|.681| |2|Kyrie Irving|85|165|.515| |3|Marcus Morris|98|194|.505| |4|Devin Booker|200|396|.505| |5|Nikola Jokic|126|251|.502| |6|Malcolm Brogdon|65|130|.500| |7|CJ McCollum|118|237|.498| |8|Chris Paul|195|395|.494| |9|Jamal Murray|101|205|.493| |10|Gordon Hayward|97|197|.492| |11|Kevin Huerter|60|122|.492|   Provided by Stathead.com: [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/tiny/zWIWJ) Generated 3/10/2021."
"It wouldn't be my first choice but I am open to making win-now moves given this window we have with Chris Paul. Like I said though, I would expect a pick or lesser asset back from the Thunder. Whether that is one of the billion picks they currently own, a swap this year with our pick and the lesser of their two firsts + a second, or them giving us the pick we owe them back which would allow us to have more future trade flexibility."
I'm not even going to brother myself by reading that. Chris Paul is just hating.
Trust me bro. Chris Paul is my fav player of all time and I watch almost every nets game. Chris Paul doesn’t move the needle for the nets. Plus his defense  is mostly on reputation. And during our win streak Our defense has improved tremendously.
Because Chris Paul is the better player regardless of how many rebounds Westbrook gets.
"He’s not better then conley, or schroeder, or chris Paul, or beverley, slightly better then dame, about the same as murray, dejonte is far better, morant is better, lonzo is better, shai is better, Fox, wall, simmons, Irving is a wash, jrue, smart, lamelo, lowry, dunn, brogdon, Sexton are all better. He is better then maybe 5 starting PGs"
Is it me or is chris paul directly ahead of a few players that he maybe shohldnt be ahead of?
"Prime Chris Paul. No.doubt, and Dame is incredible."
but you don't need Paul Pierce or Chris Bosh if you have other superstars w/ similar skills. Ben Wallace's skillset is a league of its own and very few players are comparable today (think Draymond or Rudy Gobert).
"Chris Paul should not be above Harden in any all time list, even with five more years in CPs career."
"Nets really combined the Clippers and Thunder superteams minus Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook of course, and replaced those two with Kyrie."
"I would say Chris Paul, but it’s closer than people give it credit for. Dame is obviously the better scorer, but prime  cp3 was just too good at playmaking and defending"
"Nets really combined the Clippers and Thunder superteams minus Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook of course, and replaced those two with Kyrie."
"2014/2015 season clips beat sas in first round go watch highlights of game 7. Chris Paul is on one leg kawhi is primary defender no screens deandre is on bench and he just scores right through him. Season after that is the zp injury but the one after that ""prime"" kawhi and spurs who won 65? games are stomped out of playoffs in reverse sweep after kd in a press conference says I know exactly what we have to do. And proceeds to DESTROY him all isolation. So yeah kawhi is supremely overrated because all these others have never had a series where they are just taken it to like that in a 3 year span in their ""prime""."
"I don't think Chris Webber's prime lasted long enough. Joe Johnson's best years weren't productive enough.        Personally the bar for my hall of fame would be Paul George. A 7x All-Star, best player on multiple ECF teams and a guy that's had an unbelievable near MVP calibre peak season"
Probably somebody like Chris Paul would be the bottom teir that would make it
"I would not  Chris Paul offers more in terms of leadership and defense, which is really what you need on a team with Harden/Durant"
....chris paul? He himself said the offense was too predictable and asked dantoni to keep harden on the bench because they were playing better without him
"Steph's stepback occasionally requires yoga-type crotch stretching to get separation, surprised he hasn't pulled his groin doing it. Players below 6'6"" I remember seeing on people's top 50 lists: Isiah Thomas, Allen Iverson, Chris Paul, John Stockton, Steve Nash, Jason Kidd... I know I'm forgetting some obvious ones, but Curry probably consensus #1 among these names."
Even if we kept the list to only active players i would put Harden and Chris paul above Giannis.
I think this sub would draft Ben Wallace over Paul Pierce and Chris Bosh.
"&gt; when did I compare them?  Your comment literally started with: ""And Booker doesn’t?"", in direct response to Tatum having a good excuse.  Perhaps you didn't mean to, but you 100% did compare them by trying to put having Chris Paul on par with Covid."
i see stockton as a worse version of chris paul tbh  chris being bettee thanks to being a better scorer and shooter
Did you really just try to compare getting to play with an elite pass-first HOF PG in Chris Paul with having difficult breathing due to COVID?
"Chauncey's on the edge, imo, I think he deserves to be in but I could see the argument.  Basketball Reference puts Chauncey at an 84.4% chance to get in (comparable to Paul George, Jack Sikma, JoJo White), Wallace at 45.3% (comparable to Clyde Lovelette, Chris Mullin, Paul Westphal), Rasheed at an 8.57% (comparable to Glen Rice, Elton Brand) Rip Hamilton at a 1.76% (comparable to DeAndre Jordan, Antoine Walker, David Lee).  I think their formula is a little conservative, since there are a few real notable players with way too low of chances (Pistol Pete at 10.2%, KC Jones at 28.7%, etc), and almost every player with at least a 30% chance is in the Hall as is.  For those who may be curious, the best eligible players not in the HoF per this stat are Paul Pierce, Chris Bosh, Larry Foust, Chauncey Billups, and Tim Hardaway."
"Even his rookie season? What about 2016 when Curry was killing the entire league? Also in order to be valuable you have to help your team win. I do believe LeBron was more deserving in 2018 but I’ll list every year in which LeBron on the Cavs was certainly not the MVP: 2004: Inefficient rookie. 2005: Outplayed and won less than both Steve Nash and Shaq. 2006: Increase in scoring and efficiency but decrease in steals, assists, and an increase in fouls. Also his season was not as good as Kobe’s who I believe should have won. 2007: Dirk’s MVP season. 2008: Honestly you could actually make a case for LeBron but this also should have went to Chris Paul in my opinion. 2015: Decent season LeBron wise but his defense flatlined this season. 2016: Curry cooked the whole NBA. 2017: Could make a case again but Harden, Kawhi, and Westbrook had just as good ones. In my opinion Kawhi gets the edge on all of them.  Seasons robbed of MVP: 2013(was robbed of unanimous MVP) 2018"
Chris Paul would not sign a minimum to sit on the bench behind players like Harden/Kyrie lol. He has self-respect.
"I’m sure a team would sign him for the MLE, if he’s putting up Chris Paul numbers at 42-45"
So the Pre-Chris Paul Clippers?
Blake to the nets? Who's next Chris Paul?
"I think only Kyrie And Kd have been at all associated with the black Israelite nonsense. The majority of the biggest stars in the league like Steph, Giannis, Luka, Chris Paul aren’t subscribed to that racist Farrakhan nonsense.  I agree I don’t think it’s fair KD was given a pass for liking those tweets and it really shows a lot about what type of person he is off the court."
"Did you see kyrie against the bucks in 2019? Or that just didn’t happen ?  Chris Paul got fucking injured after we went up 3-2, Wby are you intentionally leaving things out to prop up your stupid argument? Harden went against 4 allstars with 1 and still put up 32/6/6/4 and was fouled on half his threes in game 7, and we only lost by 9. The same team that 4-1d kyrie while he had lebron fucking James on his team lol. Hardens next best teammate was eric gordon  &gt; kyrie has never had the opportunity harden has had to have a team constructed around him  Yeah, because he’s not that good. Like there’s no way you are this sense.  Kyrie is a champion because he played with lebron. That does not make him better then harden in the slightest, harden would have beat the tougher warriors team had his teammate been healthy.  Kyrie isn’t a superstar, and has never been considered for MVP. You’re talking out of your ass"
Chris Paul is not a bad contract
"Chris Paul, love the little guys game #HeartOverHeight"
"Chris Paul, Westbroken, Twiggins, Kennard"
"Just because they have access to the “best modern medicine” doesn’t mean they aren’t experiencing racism from the “best modern medicine.” Serena Williams is richer than almost all NBA players are she had to beg and advocate for herself during her pregnancy to get tested for a recurrence of blood clots. She could tell something was wrong and the medical staff didn’t believe her at first. Further, some good experiences don’t overpower generations and generations of oppression. Like, come on. If anything, the fact that these guys only got access to top tier medical science after they became millionaires just perpetuates the racism they experience. They know they wouldn’t be getting the kind of treatment they do if they were just regular Donovan Mitchell who works at a car factory or regular Chris Paul who works as a chef or whatever. It just shows how fucked the medical field in America is where rich people’s lives are more valuable than poor people’s because of capitalism."
"&gt; If you're an MVP candidate, you're in your damn prime  That's not really true.  While it's not strictly age based, it's also not that simple.  It's about when are you at your peak level of performance.  Maybe Jokic is there (I would suggest that he is likely in the beginning of his prime now).  Or maybe in 2 years he takes another leap, particularly defensively.   But I think it's different for every player.  So, for Chris Paul, I agree.  In 08 he was absolutely in his prime. But, for LeBron, he was 6th in MVP voting at 20, and 2nd at 21, and deservedly so, but I would say that his personal prime didn't really start until he was 24, because that was when he was at his absolute best; it's just that he's so special that he was still an MVP candidate before (and after) his prime."
We replaced westbrook with Chris paul and *then* a young all star level guard
Chris Paul.
"I don’t believe that. A year ago, everyone would have agreed that Al Horford was on an “untradeable” contract but he still got traded. People would have said the same things 2 years ago about Chris Paul"
"Those were really top heavy classes that didn’t pan out with most of the talent coming from late 1st and 2nd round picks.  ‘04: Dwight Howard, Iguodala, Deng, Al Jefferson were the three stand outs (all 15th or higher)  ‘05: Bogut (#1), Chris Paul (#4), and Gortat (#57) were the ones in this draft.  ‘06: LaMarcus Aldridge (#2), Rudy Gay (#8), Reddick (#11), Rondo (#21), Lowery (#24), and Millsap (#47) slightly deeper but just as many bangers #20 on as there are in the top 20.  ‘07: Durant (#2 — sorry Portland), Al Horford (#3), Mike Conley (#4), Noah (#9), Thad Young (#12), Glen Davis (#35), and of course Marc Gasol (#48).  Edit: autocorrect"
"If Utah ends up with best record by far, it seems many people will not want to only give them one player in the 3rd team. League leader in points per game has always been, as I remember, always at the lowest 2nd team All-NBA, but I think Beal's situation my be an exception. So I think Kyrie, Mitchell, Devin Booker, Chris Paul and Beal all are close. I guess I could bet on Beal because he probably has the least of ""shared vote"" with others.  Paul George has a great season, I think he'd be there. Also they can count Anthony Davis as forward I think, last season it was totally possible so why not now, he could get votes over any non-star players. With the missed time he might miss it anyway though, because Jimmy Butler is playing fantastic.   These are the doubts I'd say, the other guys in this list are basically sure bets to be All-NBA."

"under adam silver yes, remember the chris paul veto?"
He also traded for 40 million dollar Chris Paul and that stuff happened nearly 15 years ago
"Chris Paul has had low turover rates, he's not a great passer in your mind?"

"So who's he better than out of lebron, kobe, duncan, wade, Durant. Those are 5 guys who are in a completely different league than him in that era. Then mix in dirk, garnett, Howard, westbrook who were all considered top 5 at some point in the era.  Chris paul was never looked at like a superstar because he never was one. Hes a very good player but 6 ft pgs have limitations"
"As a Chris Paul hater, I will admit CP3 is extremely underrated; however, he will continue to be until he defeats a juggernaut in the playoffs. It isn't fair, but as Shaq says ""Ringz Erneh!!!"""
"I would argue Luka is still currently playing with the bad level players harden played with before. Aside from KP none of the other Mavs starters are real good starter level players. Also, KP is probably not as good as Chris Paul or Westbrook who harden played with before. Also, as I said before I don’t care about the past. Also, I did not say I disagreed with the harden being better stats, I disagreed with the word much."
Booker shot 9-20 1-6 from 3 with 6 turnovers. Chris Paul also shot 2-10 Yet a lot of the suns sub was blaming Ayton the whole time. #FREEDEANDREAYTON. Send him to a team that won’t use him as a scape goat
Chris Paul effect
"They want to be right so they went overboard with the hate. It was weird  because he only played 10 games for the rockets and he wasn’t the problem.   Chris Paul even had to rebuild his rep back with okc, After the rockets trade."
Kyrie definitely. Chris Paul could be the other
"You're right, they're not equal. Chris Paul was an MVP candidate who is currently leading another team to 2nd seed in the West. Jrue Holiday was an all-star in a historically weak Eastern Conference, and hasn't made a single all-star appearance in the 8 years since that trade.   imagine thinking you actually know basketball lmaooo"
"Chris Paul, Wade, Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Isiah Thomas. In not particular order"
"“The Banana Boat Team, Banana Boat Squad or Banana Boat Crew is a hypothetical pop culture NBA superteam, consisting of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony, and Chris Paul.”  However, looking at the pictures, you’re right. Melo was on the same vacation though"
Chris Paul is not particularly close to Jerry West
Chris Paul
Chris Paul?
Chris Paul
Today's era is definitely Chris Paul.
Honestly he'd have been the next Chris Paul only if he wasn't on the Timberwolves
the point God is 6'0 and he looks like Chris Paul
Chris Paul
"Yeah Jay Z ain't it haha, but he kinda owns it I guess. I think Cedi, RoCo, and Jerami Grant are low key some relatively unappreciated fine men in the league. I also think Chris Paul is nothing special so I dunno, maybe I have weird taste."
"I appreciate you going to bat for your guy. We should be able to talk about great seasons guys are having without the framework of the MVP conversation. There are so many straight ballers into the game today and we don't need to talk about them through the MVP lens. When we start from that angle it always ends up diminishing what the guys are doing. Just like Jimmy, Chris Paul clearly has zero chance of actually winning the award. There are a million factors and it's not always in their control. But they are both having phenomenal seasons and Jimmy is clearly one of the most effective and most valuable leaders in the league. We can shine light on their stories without complaining about lack of MVP buzz."
"The thing is that this team is not just the 2020 Suns + Chris Paul. It is a significantly improved roster from top to bottom between the new signings and the continued development of younger players.   Last season Booker carried the Suns offense in a massive way. The difference in the Suns offensive rating with Booker on and off was greater than the difference between the Mavericks and the Warriors last year. And despite Ayton missing half the season, a bench that consistently gave up leads, and Oubre ending the season with a torn meniscus they were a tie-breaker away from the play-in game with a net rating better than the Spurs, Grizzlies, and Trailblazers. Booker was doing a whole lot more to carry that team than people realized."
"What you are missing here is that Chris Paul was not the only addition to the Suns this season. Compare the Suns bench from last year to now. Look at how players like Mikal Bridges and Dario Saric have taken significant leaps as contributors. Look at what newer additions like Jae Crowder and Cam Payne have brought.  I get that not a lot of people watched the Suns last year but it was a very different team in more ways than just Chris Paul. As for those 20 win teams, yeah, it's not a surprise that you win more with a supporting cast who can all legally buy alcohol."
"That's the same as Dame only having one 1st team because of Curry. His competition was just as great with Curry, Chris Paul, Harden, Westbrook, Irving, etc. He still got voted over all of them one year"
"There’s an argument to be made that the Suns were already on an upward trajectory, with going from ~20 wins to just barely missing out on the playoffs last year. Obviously Chris Paul raised their ceiling significantly, but I’d like to think that at least some of it was the new coach getting settled and young players progressing."
"best player best team, in order  jazz: no mvp caliber player, team effort  suns: should be chris paul, but stats stats stats  sixers: embiid missing too many games  nets: three hall of famers  lakers: lebron."
"I don't look at Devin Booker as a top-10 player or even top 15 quite frankly I don't think he's going to make any of the guards slots on the all NBA team, and that's not a shot at him that just speaks to the depth of the guard position in today's NBA         Not to mention I think most of the Suns recent impact comes from Chris Paul"
Because Chris Paul is getting the bulk of the credit.
"When will people learn stats aren’t everything? Lol.  Chris Paul is the prime example.  His stats are nothing too impressive, but look at the impact he has everywhere he goes and everyone is aware he’s a much better passer than Harden."
Eh hypothetically if the suns played the jazz in the playoffs I would be very scared because we have no experience while your group has multiple runs together in playoffs. I disagree however with your take on our bench. We could very easily shorten it and be fine we just need an upgrade over Kaminsky. Crowder/Cam J too small to play all the minutes at the 4 and Kaminsky will get targeted in playoffs. Chris paul and arguably Booker are also better than every player on that 14-15 hawks team. Real star power.
"I didn’t say he didn’t deserve it I’m saying he had a case similar to lebrons, where even though most advanced metrics favored chris Paul he won the mvp because voters knew he was the better player and his team was better."
"Here's a list you could argue for being ahead of him: (IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER)  1. Luka 2. LeBron 3. Giannis 4. Steph 5. Jokic 6. Embiid 7. Kawhi 8. Paul George 9. Kyrie 10. Lillard 11. Harden 12. Durant 13. Anthony Davis 14. Beal 15. Gobert 16. Butler 17. Chris Paul 18. Ben Simmons 19. Devin Booker 20. Karl Anthony Towns 21. Zach Lavine  &amp;#x200B;  That's all I could come up with. I think I would personally put Tatum ahead of 3-5 guys on this list, so he'd be in the 15-17 range for me."
"Haven't heard anyone saying that since Kyrie started dropping 40 pieces. Harden hasn't played next to a guy like that since OKC. Chris Paul was great that one year in Houston, he wasn't scoring like that though. Harden is having a great season but unless he's going on 50 point triple double streaks again he's probably not winning MVP."
"Don't listen to the haters, you have valid points. Fuck, remember when Chris Paul got traded from the Clippers and then both teams back tracked to allow the Clippers to get Beverly for some reason? Celtics should have gotten something back, Ainge fucked up there from a Boston homer pov. But I don't know much about the cba to make this comment."
"Honestly if we assume Embiid is out of the running, I’m really not sure. I guess it would be Lebron based on history. If Jokic gets the nuggets into the top 3, him.   MVP is a weird award. Lebron has been the most valuable player in the league many more times than he has been awarded it. Steph has similar stats to his MVP season and he isn’t even in the convo. Hell I can even see Barkley’s argument for Chris Paul. People like Paul and Butler are insanely valuable guys who fly under the radar because of the environment they’re in. It’s just whoever is the best player on whatever 4 teams are the top 1-2 seeds."
Dragic and Chris Paul have not dunked since 2016   Which one will dunk again first. No all star games allowed to count. Or maybe neither will ever again
"I mean it’s why they got Zion, too.        Superstar AD leaves New Orleans. This comes after Chris Paul did the same thing, and Phil Jackson even made comments to the tune or “a franchise in NO is not viable, but the league desperately wants to keep trying”.          What happens? Oh would you look at that! NO gets the most hyped player since LeBron James in the draft."
Dwayne Wade? Chris Bosh? James Worthy? Kareem? Kobe? Shaq? Kevin Garnett? Paul Pierce? Ray Allen? Super star players have super star teams.  Now go to bed
Well it’s Chris fucking Paul though.
"Everyone talks about how the Rockets didn’t with that series but no one talks about how the Trailblazers got swept without KD and being up by double digits in every game.   The Warriors were still the better team without KD, they had a 31-1 with Curry on/KD off. Advanced stats would tell you they weren’t BETTER without him, but their record was still amazing. Chris Paul had his worst season in the past 5 years + a lot of important pieces from the 2018 Rockets were let go.   Rockets wouldn’t have been able to get past the Raptors because they sell out to stop star players from getting in rhythm and it would’ve have been easier with the way CP3 was playing. They wouldn’t have been able to do that with the Warriors because they had too many weapons."
Yeah for sure trae is better at playmaking than booker but booker is still really good when you consider his role  Heck the last 3 years where he has a competent team he we have seen flashes of what he can do 2 years averaging over 6 assists as a shooting guard And this year his numbers are down because he is playing with Chris fucking Paul like the best true point guard in the league  Like he is a shooting guard that can play make pretty well (I am not going to lie and say he is amazing) but he is just a better overall player More efficient from everywhere historically Better defence  Infinitely better at midrange Like the difference between booker and trae with 3 isn't that big trae is slightly better overall in terms of raw skill (in terms of efficiency no)  But their midrange game shows booker as just far superior Heck booker is probably a top 5 midrange shooter in the league currently and if he isn't he is fucking close
"He's kinda like Chris Paul... you look at highlights of CP3 from his younger days and except for gaining some weight, he still looks really similar. Curry's much the same... still looks a bit baby-faced, muscled out compared to how skinny he was coming in. He's going to be 33 this month, 12th year on the Warriors, and the oldest and longest tenured guy on the team. Only Wanamaker and Bazemore are close. I like having Baze on the team since he's Steph's age, and he was on the Warriors during Curry's lean years."
Chris Paul was the best player on the 2018 Rockets in the playoffs.
"Chris Paul, tho we haven’t seen 20-21 Kyrie in the playoffs yet"
"Since most of his playing days was with Chris Paul who had the ball in his hands most of the time, or DeAndre Jordan grabbing rebounds."
"I agree in the abstract, although MVP shouldn't work like that. You could say that's how Nash and Malone got theirs.  I remember thinking at the time that Lebron had the better season and was the best player, over Dwight and certainly Rose. But Dwight led the league in blocks and boards with amazing D, what else does a guy have to do to get MVP? So Dwight was my second choice that year, and I can't argue against people who have him 1st. I think Rose was 8th in PER and Chris Paul had a better statistical season.  Rose led a league leading defensive bulls team when he was an average defender, he was the only offense, but I'll never agree with his mvp."
"Last Cavs win in New Orleans: March 24, 2010 when Lebron beat New Orleans legend Chris Paul"
"It’s both. Chris Paul has elevated this team tremendously, BUT to act like Booker could not have made the playoffs with last year’s roster and Chris Paul is their sole savior is really disrespectful. We had a TON of injuries last year and Ayton missed 25 games to start the season.  I think if they had ran it back this year with Rubio at the point Booker could’ve led them to the playoffs (provided everyone stayed relatively healthy). Probably as an 8 seed but still. The point is the Suns didn’t need Chris Paul to get to the playoffs, but at the same time he took us from probably a 7-8 seed to a 2 seed, which is still insane"
PG: Chauncey Billups  SG: Vince Carter  SF: Paul Pierce  PF: Chris Webber  C: Hakeem Olajuwon
Lol we love Chris. The narrative that Chris Paul just showed up and took us from the basement to the top is just not true

I am ok with you liking Kyrie over AI even if you are wrong but to say that it is disrespectful to Kyrie to say that is nuts bro.   Everyone has AI in the top 50 of all time.  Just one example below.. Kyrie doesn't even make the list (even thought that too is wrong.. for instance I take Kyrie over Chris Paul).   [https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/29105681/ranking-top-74-nba-players-all-nos-40-11](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29105681/ranking-top-74-nba-players-all-nos-40-11)  Bleacher report (who again are wrong) have AI as an honorable mention in their top 50 but no mention of Kyrie.  Bleacher report is wrong as Pau Gasol is in the top 50 as an example.   Kyrie's stats   [https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/i/irvinky01.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/i/irvinky01.html)  AI stats  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/i/iversal01.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/i/iversal01.html)  &amp;#x200B;  Kyrie is: 22.7 / 5.7 Pts / assists  AI is 26.7 / 6/2 pts / assists   AI played at a far more physical time where defence was prioritized over scoring vs now.  He was more likely to be punched into the first row than this bs flopping going on now and he still has better career stats.   Most that played him said he was the toughest to guard.  Gilbert Arenas famously said he would rather guard Kobe than AI.
"A couple reasons. In the NBA, the team with the star almost always wins the trade. The KG and Pierce trade was an aberration because those guys were old and the Nets got way worse way faster than anyone anticipated.    James Harden is not on that career swing yet, and will be better for longer. As LeBron and Chris Paul have proved, a player can maintain productivity well into their late 30s. It's not like any of these guys will be banging down low or are overly reliant on athleticism either.    The Nets are also in the worse conference and Sean Marks has built this team from nothing once before, he can do it again. They're in the premier Eastern conference market, and will always be an enticing free agent destination. The Nets will do everything in their power to be good.   Finally, first round picks have been way overvalued lately. It's harder for teams to tank now and there's a lack of good prospects. There's no guarantee there'll be a player half as good as Harden available with those picks. Better to give up a ton of picks for a sure thing than make a gamble that another team will be bad enough to get you good picks, and that you can nail those draft picks if/when you get them."
"Nah, it's definitely Chris Paul. It's not a coincidence that he has made every team better than they were before. I know that Suns fans don't want to admit it because they'd rather praise the ""core"" that's been around a lot longer, especially the franchise star."
"Weird didnt this happen with Chris Paul and Harden like, a few years ago?"
This argument should've been killed after James Harden and Chris Paul led one of the greatest non-title teams of all time in 2017-18
"Karl Malone, Charles Barkley, Steve Nash, Elgin Baylor, James Harden, Chris Paul are all clearly better then Stockton and Ewing are  debatable as better. Iverson is possibly 9th or 10th."
Chris Paul
Deron Williams and Chris Paul
"They are a team that is probably going to lose in the 2nd round or even the 1st round as presently constituted, but has 80% of a championship puzzle piece completed, and if they traded for Kyle Lowry, I could see them winning it all.   They need that Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Jrue Holiday ish type point guard to win a chip, that's the last piece IMO."
"“by my definition” lol.   MVP has a definition, and it is: “best performing player of the regular season.”  Is Chris Paul *really* the best performing player of the regular season? Over Jokic or Embiid?"
David Stern nullifying the Chris Paul to Lakers trade may have saved Caris LeVert's life
"Without CP3 suns are a borderline playoff team. With him they have the best record in the NBA. Again my point is Chuck, an nba analyst, thinks Chris Paul came to the suns and took them from last place to first. Which just isn’t true. Books never been in the playoffs, besides these last two years have you seen some of the rosters he’s had? Prime MJ isn’t carrying Tyler ulis, chriss, and bender to the playoffs lol"
Just going to throw Jimmy's name in the basket. He's a very underrated passer with an assist/turnover ratio of only .2 below Chris Paul for someone who's on high level usage and averaging 8 asts a game (easily 10 with better teammates)
"&gt;I'm trying to base this off eye test but idk if I'm fully right  Based off eye-test Jokic easily makes the best passes in the league but he isn't as consistent as LeBron, so I'd still put Bron #1 and Jokic #2. After that it's a toss-up, I'd say Harden is #3 and 4# goes split between Doncic and CP3. Chris Paul plays a very safe brand of Basketball which prevents him from throwing high leverage passes that the very best ever throw regularly. It's also partly a reason why CP3 offenses crumble in do-or-die playoff situations when the margin for error is too small to play CP3 Basketball successfully."
Chris Paul pulling his hamstring in the 2018 Western Conference Finals may have saved Caris LeVert's life.
Chris Paul is overrated
Chris Paul is making it over him IMO. And even after that there's Zach Lavine
Thank you for your input /u/Chris-Paul-Overrated

"Yeah, and Kemba Walker Is better than Chris Paul because of his career PPG"
"Chuck had a good supporting cast with 7 guys averaging in double figures (KJ, Thunder Dan, Cedric Ceballos, Tom Chambers and Danny Ainge where all all stars at points in their careers... That's 6 out of the top 7 who became all star players vs our 2 in Book and Chris Paul) ...   Kevin Johnson is arguably a better passer than Chris Paul and had an awesome career, Dan Majerle was a great defender (2nd team all defense in 93) but was our best shooter at a high clip at that time (38% on 5.3 attempts); Cedric Ceballos (future all star) had an even higher fg% than Charles at 57.6% that lead the entire league at that time, and he's a small forward, Danny Ainge was still serviceable (played 80 games and hit 40% of his 3s at 4.7 attempts per game) and also averaged double figures; Richard Dumas had a remarkable year as well with 15.8ppg, wc is more than Ayton or Bridges' averages per game, and don't forget about Tom Chambers who was at a decline bit still averaged 12.2 ppg and shooting 39% from 3 while playing 73 games. Mark west and Oliver Miller aren't of the same caliber as Ayton, or even Saric/Kaminsky, but held the middle nicely and passed the ball really well for bigs then, especially Oliver Miller...  I'd argue the 92-93 suns may have the better talent up top, but our 2020-21 suns are better up to the 13th man (still not sold on Jalen Smith tbh).  If you saw that Suns team, they were a joy to watch and also had a strong will to win despite the odds... Chuck was a 6'4""-6'5"" PF for crying out loud, lol... But he dominated on offense and rebounded better than anybody despite his height... That's why they got to the Finals and almost pulled off the championship despite losing the first 2 games at Home... I believed they were a better team than the Bulls, but the Bulls just had the greatest player in the league at that time... Good times :-)  GO SUNS!!!"
"Mitch's failing with the Lakers was that he wouldn't tamper or do any backroom shenanigans.  It's why his free agent signings were bad and why the Chris Paul trade went tits up.   He's a shrewd trader and good drafter. If you have someone to take care of the tampering, you'll be golden with Mitch at the helm."
"Impact metrics like those also have regular anomalies and inaccuracies of their own.  According to RAPTOR his teammates Damion Lee and Kelly Oubre are better defenders than him (anyone who’s watched a Warriors game would laugh at this), and PJ Tucker, Chris Paul, Middleton, and Siakam are all worse/negative defenders.  The reality is that there are no perfect defensive stats, and they all need more context to be interpreted properly."
"The nash trade ended up bad, but it was a high risk high reward move.  The lakers had been searching for someone to take more ball handling responsibilities away from kobe to help extend his career, chris Paul was the other big one we looked at, and the prevailing thought at the time was even if he isn't healthy, the core of kobe pau Dwight would get us into the playoffs and compete.  So we're risking a couple of first rounders we were relatively sure would be late ones.  It didn't end up that way, kobe got hurt and Dwight left, but im not upset we swung for the fences and missed."
"Yeah man, Paul George, Chris Paul, James Harden, TMac, Nash, Iverson, Melo, Charles Barkley... List of scrubs right there.  FOH and put some respect on his name."
Curry won mvp With the best record in the league 6th in ppg. That would be good for 20th in the current year.  There’s not a single person that would put Chris Paul in the mvp race this year.
"Agreed young teams get better, is not just Chris Paul, they just don't want to admit they were wrong about this core and Booker"
"You will be forgiven for leaving out Chris Paul, because that's the kind of merciful Point God He is.  Unless you go on the floor with your jersey untucked. Then all bets are off."
The only difference is Chris Paul is such a lazy take. Crowder and the bench are huge strengths of ours
"Im a massive Suns fan and I think realistically he’d probably be more in the 3rd team range. Voters love Harden, Steph, and Dame so I don’t think he’ll be first team, and then Kyrie, Luka are competing with him for second team not to mention Mitchell and Chris Paul has to be in that mix somewhere. If the Suns end up a top two seed in the league they absolutely deserve at least one all team player, and should deserve two, but there’s only fifteen spots so it’s tough"
If Chris Paul is a MVP candidate then Gobert should be close to the top.
"“I got two words for ya, Chris Paul must be in the MVP conversation!”"
Let's get this straight. He wasn't a throw-in.   Chris Paul was the throw-in in the Abdel Nadel trade.
"I'm not saying CP3 is the MVP, but:  2004-05 season: Established superstar Shaquille O'Neal joins a new team that has a dynamic young guard but isn't winning much. He doesn't have the most eye-popping stats, but immediately makes that team a contender. To Shaq, that is a surefire MVP.  2020-21 season: Established superstar Chris Paul joins a new team that has a dynamic young guard but isn't winning much. He doesn't have the most eye-popping stats, but immediately makes that team a contender. a To Shaq, that player belongs nowhere near the MVP conversation.   alright then"
" The west has won the majority of the games between eastern conference teams and western conference teams, I don’t recall the exact numbers but I’m sure someone has them. That alone is a way more impactful piece of evidence than you not trusting Chris Paul or whatever."
Didn’t realize Chris Paul getting a hamstring injury is folding

"Draymond, Chris Paul, LeBron James, and the rest of them"
"Closeout games aren't the only important games in the NBA though.   Like I said, Chris Paul has put up plenty of stinkers in the playoffs throughout his career. That's objectively true."
"Chris Paul, but worse"
Ingram punched Chris Paul and got 4 games so I guess punching a ref would get you 10+ games. Also depends on the nature of the punch I’d bet
"I really don't get why people have their panties up in a bunch over this shit. I really don't care for SAS (or Westbrook for this matter), but I'm failing to see what SAS said that everyone is so upset about. I do admit I haven't really followed anything in detail, but it seems like it boils down to the following:  1. Westbrook is a stand up guy. I don't know him, I doubt anyone on this sub really does either. But all of his former teammates, coaches, people that do know him personally all say he is a great teammate and great person. I don't think anyone here disagrees with this (including SAS as he pointed out)  2. Westbrook, over the course of his career, has put up incredible numbers and put together all-time highlights. Again, like him or not, no one can dispute this. He literally accomplished something that hadn't been done in 50 years, regardless of how you feel he obtained those stats.  3. This is where people may disagree, but the point SAS I think is making is that Russell Westbrook's style of play is not conducive to winning basketball. This is sentiment I have seen promoted on this sub for years and years and years. Even going back to 2012, the question was always ""Is Westbrook holding Durant back?"", ""Does Russ need to shoot less and be a point guard more?"".  It's unfair that SAS phrases it in a way of saying ""no chips"". There are plenty of players who have no chips but we do not blast in this way. For example, Chris Paul definitely gets knocked a little for not having a ring, but not to the extent Westbrook does. BUT, I think part of the reason for this is that (in the general opinion of this sub) Chris Paul's style of play IS a winning style. There hasn't been as many stinker games/series that Paul had individually compared to Westbrook. Paul generally had worst teammates and worst luck injury wise. This is not my opinion, but the opinion I see of this sub having been a lurker/member since 2013."
"Chris Paul to the Suns.  May not have seemed like the biggest at the time but looking at where the teams are now, that's probably had the largest impact on winning for any team."
"Biggest additions probably Gordon Hayward for the Hornets and Chris Paul for the Suns, biggest losses John Wall for the Rockets and Steven Adams for the Pelicans"
Chris Paul should have plenty of experience.
"Eh, I wouldn't be too harsh on anybody predicting zero MVPs for Jokic.  Think of all the really great players that never won.  D Wade, Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Isiah Thomas, Stockton, Chris Paul, Scottie Pippen.  Getting an MVP doesn't just take a ton of talent but also some luck.  For the player that was drafted today, even the really talented ones, the most likely outcome is that his career will end without an MVP.  I expect Jokic to contend for the award, definitely, but remember that fortune can be cruel."
"Yeah I mean that's another Daryl Morey special lol. ""We are not trading Ben Simmons period"" while trying to concoct whatever trade scenario he could to get Ben Simmons to Houston. Same with Chris Paul."
"The media create the narrative, people on social media follow and parrot those ideas and put pressure on. Chris Paul is an all time great without a ring, so is Barkley and Malone. Players ring chase and form super teams for this reason using not winning a championship as a slight."
"PG -- Chris Paul   SG -- Jrue Holiday      SF --  Brandon Ingram   PF --  Zion   C -- Anthony Davis    BONUS: 6th Man: David West     Literally everybody else would have some sort of Asterisk of ""Well, but...."" I'm pretty sure Shoeless Joe Jackson might qualify as our 7th man."
"Anything that happened after Charlotte is ours. Otherwise, we'd be talking about Chris Paul winning ROY for the Thunder because he won playing in Oklahoma City."
The difference between Chris Paul and nikola vucevic is that Chris Paul is still one of the best point guards in the league and nikola Vucevic is a fringe eastern conference all star who only plays one on side of the floor.
"Well... a lot of great players don't have rings. Barkely. Stockon. K. Malone. George Gervin. Elgin Baylor. Nique. Reggie Lewis. Chris Paul. Mutumbo.   And some truly great players only have one: Garnett, Dirk, Paul Pierce.   A player's greatness isn't about how many rings they got; it's about what they do on the court.   It's guys like Stephen A. Smith that drive players to chase rings.    And then those same guys complain when players move around to win a title.   &amp;#x200B;  That said, I don't think teams could build a champion around Westbrook or Carmelo.  The guy you build your team around has to have a core drive that's going to put their team in a position to win.   &amp;#x200B;  Melo's core drive was scoring. He's said it before. If his team won and he didn't score 30, he felt like he wasn't doing his job.   Westbrook's drive is filling the box scores.   But as a team, the core drive needs to be something outside of personal stats.   &amp;#x200B;  Jordan's core drive was to score and defend and fill the stat sheet, but he changed it to winning. It wasn't enough to win the match up and be the best player on the court. He needed to be on the best team. His drive changed. People might piss on the or down vote it, but I watched Jordan before he won a title and he was a different player before Phil Jackson. That first year with Phil, Jordan changed his game. It wasn't enough that year because they needed to fill the roster first, but there was a change.   Other guys, like LeBron: his core drive is to lead and win. He puts guys on the court and moves them around and calls out defensive assignments and switches. But it's all toward the ring, not the personal stats.   Curry's drive is to get the best shot for the team. He shares the ball even though he's the best shooter in the history of the game.   Teams gotta build around a guy whose core drive is the team, not personal stats.   Do Westbrook and Melo want to win. Of course. But they also want to get their stats.   Melo has humbled himself now, and doing well by it, but the Blazers aren't built around him: They are built around Dame.   &amp;#x200B;  So if you get guys like Melo, or Westbrook, or McGrady, or Nique, as AMAZING as all of them are (First ballot HOF), then have a certain drive that is more individual than collective. You can build a champion around that."
"I mean we traded two picks and a bench center for an all star, who cares how old he is? Our core is roughly the same age as the suns, but they didn’t get clowned when they traded for a much older Chris Paul right? We have a top center on a fantastic contract locked up for the next several years and are clearly building around Zach, this is all just projection lol"
Chris Paul and Clint Capela were no Bruce Brown and Nick Claxton for sure.
Then what exactly does Chris Paul do better than Harden?
"Pos: Starter (Bench)  PG: Steph Curry (Tim Hardaway, Sleepy Floyd, Baron Davis)  SG: Klay Thompson (Mitch Richmond, Jason Richardson, Purvis Short)  SF: Kevin Durant (Chris Mullin, Paul Arizin)  PF: Rick Barry (Draymond Green)  C: Wilt Chamberlain (Nate Thurmond)"
"Chris Paul, Jrue Holiday, Glen Rice, Anthony Davis, and Alonzo Mourning starting with Larry Johnson, Zion, Brandon Ingram, Baron Davis, and Dell Curry (I guess I don't remember too many more Pelicans guards tbh) as the second unit. The Pelicans all time team would be fun."
PG: Calvin Murphy  SG: James Harden  SF: Clyde Drexler  PF: Moses Malone  C: Hakeem Olajuwon  6: Elvin Hayes  7: Yao Ming  8: Ralph Sampson  9: Tracy McGrady  10: Chris Paul  11: Kenny Smith  12: Steve Francis  13: Robert Horry  14: Otis Thorpe  15: Vernon Maxwell  Head Coach: Rudy Tomjanovich
"&gt; but tell me what has CP3 done more than Harden who has led better offense,  Chris Paul being in the same argument as LeBron is laughable.  I say this is someone that really likes CP and has for years. If anything, he should be clumped in with Harden/Westbrook here."
"What conclusions am I supposed to be drawing from this 1 playoff series?  &gt; remember watching that series where, despite playing well, Chris Paul would be invisible for quarters at a time and usually show up in the fourth quarter.  Yeah. He's 34. How many 34 year olds can keep that level of play every minute they're on the court?"
"&gt; They weren't a good offense to begin with and the roster was filled with young players with no experience lol  They were roughly a league average offense and a good defensive team.   I think the point being made is that they were basically the same team in the regular season but their offensive rating dropped over 8 full points against Houston. That's a huge   Houston's offensive rating dropped as well, but by roughly 3.5 points.  You can wave it off with ""playoff experience"" and such but their offense did ""fall apart,"" there's really no question about it. Chris Paul was the leader of that team, and I remember watching that series where, despite playing well, Chris Paul would be invisible for quarters at a time and usually show up in the fourth quarter."
"I don't think anyone will tell you that Harden is immune to bad games.  Chris Paul has put up his fair share of stinkers as well though, as recently as last year he has had awful playoff games."
"&gt;In a Chris Paul comp this is just disingenuous.   I don't think you understood the point if you think this.   &gt;Then how come Harden has objectively more playoff success  Because playoff wins are about more than offensive efficiency.   &gt;Because he's not a scorer like those two guys (especially Harden) are. He still dominates the ball, there's really no question about it.  Yeah. Anyone that facilitates an offense is going to dominate the ball."
"&gt; And every year since then they've fallen off in the playoffs.  In a Chris Paul comp this is just disingenuous.   &gt; By being sustainable through the playoffs.  Then how come Harden has objectively more playoff success?  &gt; I'm arguing the point about CP3 being a ball hog in the same way that Russ and Harden are.  Because he's not a scorer like those two guys (especially Harden) are. He still dominates the ball, there's really no question about it."
"Your username is randomrocketsfan and you forgot Harden? Really?   LeBron, Harden, Giannis, Kawhi, Jimmy Butler, Luka, Jokic, Chris Paul, Dame Lillard etc."
"Yes, guys like Russ are simply too powerful.   If I were to guess who would make good football players, it would be guys like Allen Iverson, Chris Paul, JJ Barea and other similar players, as their playstyle and technique translates to football better than pure speed or strength."
"These posts are silly. Chris Paul? What has he done? His winning basketball has gotten him a little deeper in the playoffs than Westbrook took OKC when he was the only star?   And LeBron is one of if not the best player in the history of basketball. No, Harden and Westbrook aren't on his level.   But Harden was a really shitty shooting night away from beating the KD warriors and Westbrook makes the wizards look like they might have a chance of winning games when Beal sits.  Put either of these guys on KDs warriors and they win just as many chips. Hell, Harden never gets injured so maybe they win that last one too."
MVP should be Chris Paul. Convince me otherwise.

"&gt;All the same passes?  Yes, all the same passes, your homer goggles notwithstanding.  &gt;This is really simple- the Venn diagram between players who are big enough to play C and who have the passing skill of Chris Paul has only a tiny sliver of overlap, Nikola Jokic.   Paul has averaged 11+ assists in multiple seasons, and carries a career 9.4 average.  Jokic's career high for a whole season is currently 7.3, which he will likely raise to 8.x this year.  His career number is 5.8, and even many of those come from simply being tall -- as they do with many centers, who can look over a defense.  So, flatly, no.  You are talking completely out of your ass here, again.  &gt; Nuggets are one of the best teams in the NBA  Yet at the moment, they will play their first-round series without home-court.  &gt;, the record isn’t that relevant with only 46 games played   So they are pacing themselves and planning to turn it on later?  &gt; Net rating and ORTG say what they’re doing is working, and they’ll be above the 5 seed soon.   If so, only due to other teams' injuries.  &gt; and they’ve been one of the most successful teams   That's pretty questionable, with 1 game won beyond the second round since 2009 and only 2 visits to the playoffs under Malone.  &gt; Yes, playing at their pace works.   Kind-of.  Good enough to be a low seed in the playoffs, but maybe they can pull a first-round upset.  Were I a Nugget fan, my sights would be set higher.  &gt; and it seems that most of the people you interact with agree, judging by your post history   Yeah, this is r/nba, populated mostly by teenagers with little knowledge of basketball.  I'm absolutely fine with being in opposition to that crowd.  &gt;  Jokic is going to win MVP this year   He might very well.  Hopefully he doesn't run out of gas.  Ya know, like he did in the Conference Finals against the Lakers last year.  Actually never mind.  Keep running him ragged.  Being able to brag about him dribbling the ball up the court is probably way more important than the Conference Finals."
"All the same passes? Those aren’t even good passes by Jokic standards, almost all the passes in that video are routine 5ft passes from the post, Jokic does those all the time.   This is really simple- the Venn diagram between players who are big enough to play C and who have the passing skill of Chris Paul has only a tiny sliver of overlap, Nikola Jokic. There simply aren’t many players like that, period. Vlade doesn’t show even 30% of the versatility Jokic has as a passer in that video, he was clearly quite limited in his capacity there, and couldn’t have played like a PG. Those are just glorified drive and kick passes except to another player in the paint, and a couple of easy bounce passes on breakaways. Nothing that special.    Nuggets are one of the best teams in the NBA, the record isn’t that relevant with only 46 games played. Net rating and ORTG say what they’re doing is working, and they’ll be above the 5 seed soon. Taking the ball up has a marginal effect on fatigue if anything, again you haven’t proven that or even provided evidence that it matters.    Yes, playing at their pace works. It fits the flow of the team and they’ve been one of the most successful teams over the past few years even with an extremely young core. You seem cognitively impaired, based on the way you’re framing arguments, and it seems that most of the people you interact with agree, judging by your post history. Jokic is going to win MVP this year, or at least is a major favorite according to Vegas, and if you think you understand this stuff better than the Nuggets excellent staff &amp; Jokic himself do, you should probably get a job in the league instead of typing out long posts with 14 upvotes like a loser."
"Nope. John Stockton, Isaiah Thomas, arguably Chris Paul."
"Russ not winning any championships is not Russ’ fault. OKC’s front office fucked up his best chance at a ring, and the Thunder were simply never good enough to get back to that level after the 2012 Finals run.   He’s actually won a hell of a lot of games, including in the playoffs. He’s got more playoff success than guys like Tracy McGrady, Dame Lillard, Chris Paul, and plenty more all time great players, but he gets more hate than all of them."
"embiid, harden, kyrie, durant, giannis, sabonis, lavine, butler, adebayo, trae young, vucevic, beal, luka, zion, ingram, mitchell, gobert, lillard, jokic, kahwhi, paul geroge, lebron, booker, chris paul, randle, anthony davis, curry. So he's somewhere around 30?"
"I mean Steph Curry has insane technique. He couldn’t have put the thousands of hours of dribbling and shooting a basketball into dribbling and shooting a soccer ball and made himself a successful soccer player? What about Chris Paul? Dame? Kemba? John Wall? De’Aaron Fox?  It’s just impossible for me to imagine that a great point guard’s speed, body control, acceleration / deceleration, footwork, leaping, strength to play through contact, etc wouldn’t translate. Obviously the ball skills still need to be developed from a young age, but the same goes for basketball and all these guys achieved that."
I know I’m joking you would’ve been fine this season and a playoff team without overrated Chris Paul. Devin booker is better with him off the floor.
"Who would have thought that adding Chris Paul to a good clutch player in Booker would actually make him worse in the closing stages of the game. I love Jae Crowder though, thank you CP3."
Chris Paul is carrying this team to the playoffs. They were NOTHING before he joined them.
What are we calling superstar? Best player on a Championship team? Because if so you can argue Prime Chris Paul was the best player in Lob City quite easily. But Blake was so good so fast (all star his rookie season remember) that it really seemed he was on track to be that superstar player but injuries derailed that whole team.
He wasn’t but many will say he was because of how popular he was  Everybody knew Chris Paul was the man of that team and only say Chris was a borderline superstar
"He made Chris Paul, the best PG any of us ever seen, wanna go to THE FUCKING CLIPPERS"
I bet he doesn’t even like NBA legend Chris Paul.
Literally they paraded around saying Blake Griffin Chris Paul and Deandre Jordan could win a championship
you're mixing up NOLA and Charlotte. Chris Paul never played here
"Hornets got Chris Paul, Eddie Jones, Glen Rice, Larry Johnson and Alonzo Mourning.  I really like that fit, especially in today's NBA."
"Ofc not 1st ballot but looking at who gets in, he will prob get in. Webber had the money problem in college. Dirk and dwade just retired they aren’t eligible yet. Chris Bosh and paul pierce were just named a finalist and they are easily in. Carter just retired too he ain’t elgibke yet. Chauncey could get in, kemp prime wasn’t long enuf, mark price is just missing playoff success so he prob won’t get in. Tim hardaway was nominated a finalist I believe recently too, might be wrong shout this"
"Guys like Chris Webber, Shawn Kemp, Chauncey Billups, Vince Carter Chris Bosh, Paul Pierce, Tim Hardaway, Mark Price, Dirk Nowitzki, Dwayne Wade and about 25 current NBA players are all more worthy than Lowry. And that's just off the top of my head.  If he is going to get in, it's not going to be first ballot and it's going to take a long time depending on the candidates available."
"NBPA president Chris Paul has been mum on the issue for the last three weeks after being quoted as saying, “I think all of these decisions are personal-type decisions.”  LeBron James made a similar comment earlier this month when asked about the vaccine, agreeing that it's ""a private thing.""    --- They are being unbelievably irresponsible it's sad what they are doing as role models to so many youth and African Americans in the US."
"Holy shit, this article is so poorly written.  It's actually funny. While I can understand guys like Dray and Bam not making the top five while their teams wallow in mediocrity (I am looking at you though Pacers), the fact that the **next** five on their list hidden at the bottom are Matisse Thybulle, Fred VanVleet, Chris Paul, Jakob Poeltl, and Josh Hart leads me to believe whoever wrote this doesn't know a basketball from a hockey puck."
"Nash, Chris Paul, rose, magic, Jason Williams? I mean there have been a lot of great handlers"
"Lol bullshit. Westbrook was trash the one playoffs they had together, literally useless. Capella was a rim rolling center who only scored if it was off harden and was completely neutralized against golden state.   Ariza and PJ? 3 and D role players? The fact that you even mentioned them proves how shitty your argument is  Dwight was never good against golden state and often injured most of the season. Chris Paul was good that one year and we were up 3-2 on golden state until he got injured.  Just admit you don’t know what you’re talking about and move on."
"Not disrespecting Harden whatsoever, but if you compare the 2 teams... there’s a huge difference in having as your 2nd best player Chris Paul instead of Kevin Love (who was terrible that season). I’d prefer having guys like PJ Tucker, Eric Gordon and Clint Capela over JR Smith, George Hill and Tristan Thompson any day of the week"
"League allowed it. If you remember, they vetoed a trade for Chris Paul to the Lakers back when Kobe was looking for a buddy to pair up with. Allowing Harden to join forces with KD and Kyrie, might seem legal in most ways, but lets be honest here, these guys are all cornerstone pieces for different franchises."
"Yeah there’s a middle ground that few people acknowledge between ring chasing by joining already stacked teams and staying with one team your entire career. And that middle ground is perfectly fine. If you give your team a fair chance to put pieces around you and they don’t in a reasonable amount of time, you have every right to go somewhere else. Just don’t go to the fucking 73-9 Warriors or some bullshit like that. But like for example if we had not gotten Chris Paul and failed to make the playoffs this year, I would not blame Booker if he wanted out. Loyalty is great, but Dame didn’t have to go down this path. I think he could’ve asked out years ago and most Portland fans would have understood. So to have him passive aggressively taking shots at other players not being as loyal as he is (which is a ridiculous standard of loyalty) is pretty silly considering nobody forced him into this"
 Chris Paul?
"&gt;	no rational person is saying the Spurs were some super dirty team and that should be their legacy.   They were though, and they should be. Bowen is the dirtiest player to ever play sports.   &gt;	Bowen’s streak of 500 consecutive games ended when he drew a one-game suspension for kicking New Orleans Hornets point guard Chris Paul in March of 2008. Amare Stoudemire once accused Bowen of purposely kicking him in the playoffs. Mild-mannered Dirk Nowitzki has complained numerous times about the “dirty play” from one of the Spurs, though he has never mentioned Bowen by name."
"CP3 has only made it past the second round once in his whole career. You can have the close, but never a MVP winner Chris Paul with no records and major accolades to his name meanwhile Stock will own 2/5 major stats for the rest of NBA history."
"Give me a guy who was a perennial MVP candidate in his prime and has been carrying teams to the playoffs his whole career over the guy who never finished higher than 7th in MVP voting and has inflated assists stats early in his career due to the system he played in, giving him a bunch of gimme assists to Karl Malone. Chris Paul is literally better at every aspect of the game - scoring, playmaking, defense, shooting"
"I didn't say he's the only player with character or staying in one team is the only way to show high character. I was specifically talking about this specific value, which in my opinion is admirable and good for the league. It's fine if you don't share that opinion, but saying ""Chris Paul is a good person and he's been on 5 teams"" has nothing to do with what I'm talking about."
"Dame is both a) a great great player b) by all indications he’s a very high character individual   I don’t agree at all with the premise that staying in Portland, “loyalty” and the need to constantly broadcast that have anything to do with character. Staying in one place is much more about just staying in your comfort zone than it is about “your character”. Chris Paul has won many awards for his service and made many peoples lives better around him and he’s been on 5 teams. Many many other ex like that the business decision of where you play basketball isn’t about character and dame staying in one place isn’t why he’s a high character individual"
Makes sense that Chris Paul is a better pg than a 2 time mvp and the all time leader in assists and steals.
gimme the suns also Chris Paul always owns them
"What a dumb comment lmao. He’s 58% for his career as a rocket in the playoffs, well above league average.  &gt; last season against the lakers  Lmao talk about cherry picking, that game he still had like 21/10/4/3/2, literally his only bad game of the series and he still did that. For the series, he put up 30 and 8 on 65% TS while playing 4 on 5 against the champs, russ wasn’t even being guarded and harden was being hard doubled the whole time. He had 17 and 4 on 40% TS.  &gt; 2018 against the warriors  Ah yes just completely ignore that Chris Paul went down and he was facing 4 allstars with eric gordon on his side. What the fuck? Even then, he didn’t even have bad games. In game 7 he put up 32/6/6/4 and was fouled on like 4 different three pointers  https://youtu.be/aYveyAb6mvU  They win that series if Chris Paul plays, something nobody was able to come even close to doing  &gt; 2019 he was just ok again  35/7/6 on 60% TS for the series against the warriors while his supporting cast was doing Jack shit, but yes he was just “okay”. Just admit you’re not willing to give him any credit and move on, you’re embarrasing yourself.  &gt; 2017   Yes, we know he was bad for that one game."
Yes? He’s a better passer than every PG in the league other than maybe Chris Paul.
My problem with the floor general argument is that people who have watched other players disagree. It completely depends perspective and is subjective. No one in their right mind thinks LeBron is worse at being a floor general than Chris Paul
I'm just pointing out the flaws. You can show the math all you want but if the data doesnt back the actual results. There is definitely something wrong with the data. I'm using them as an example. I dont think for a second stockton is better than chris paul
The Donald Sterling owned and Vinny del Negro coached LA Clippers landed 26 years old Chris Paul while sucking for the better part of the previous ten years. Location is one of the biggest factors.
"By checking what the average ORTG was for a season, it allows you to compare between eras. It allows you to see how much 3 pointers, different rules, style of play affected scoring.  For example, in 1987-88, John Stockton had an ORTG of 125 (career high) compared to the league average of 108.  In 2012-13, Chris Paul had an ORTG of 127 compared to a league average of 106.  What we can extrapolate from this information is:  Despite your claims of tougher rules, hand checking, fewer 3 pointers, scoring was actually EASIER in 1987 than it was in 2013.  It also shows us that both Stockton and Paul far outperformed the league average, by 22 and 21 respectively per100.  If we include DRTG, it shows that Stockton in 1988 had a Net Rating of +23 (125 ORTG, 102 DRTG) while Paul in 2013 had a Net Rating of +25 (127, 102)  This information shows us that Paul outperformed Stockton on both offense and defense per 100.  There you go, Ive accounted for far more things than pace. You just need to be a bit creative with its use."
"Not in a specific order but below are the players i would take above zion.  lbj, ad, giannis, luka, kawhi, kd, dame, steph, harden, jokic, embiid, tatum, butler, jaylen brown, ben simmons, kat, chris paul  Thats 17   i think bam, simmons, booker, and paul george. are all around where zion is.   so calling him top 20 is reasonable."
Yeah its similar to the PG draft situation. Clipper fans were begging for Paul George pre-draft and the team took Aminu. In hindsight he'd be in the deal for Chris Paul anyways
Imagine booker and Chris Paul having Zion with them ... whew
"You're really out here trying to say that a team who had:  Dwight howard force his way there via trade  signed Steve Nash and Lebron James in free agency  and had even more players try to force their way there like Chris Paul ""haven't had interest from stars? lol  Ok, you say that's too recent, let's go back farther and look at a few free agent signings:  - Rajon Rondo  - KCP  - Derek Fisher  - Ron Artest  - Horace Grant  - Karl Malone  - Gary Payton  - Mitch Richmond   - Ron Harper  - Rick Fox  - Shaq  - Magic Johnson  is 30 years enough or should we go farther?"
The average NBA player today is better than the average NBA player of the 90s that is a bigger difference than most of what you are mentioning.  So Chris Paul on average has had better teammates than Stockton but it’s not like the top end minute goers Stockton played with we scrubs.  Also it’s not Chris Paul’s fault teams decided to shoot more threes as he got older.  You also conveniently ignore the first 6 years of his career when teams still played this weird mix of modern ball and early 2000s iso ball.
"Respectfully disagree. I think KD and Harden or KD and Kyrie (like earlier this season when we had Caris, Spence healthy, and JA) can win a ring. I don’t think Harden and Kyrie can win a ring. Especially if Harden and Chris Paul/Harden and Westbrook couldn’t"
I feel it was mainly Chris Paul is a hard guy to be a team mate for a long time. One season? Sign me up. 5? Getting yelled at on the court all the time gets old. And they couldn’t get past the warriors with him questionable to play a 7 game series.   I feel harden wanted a new side kick and lobbied hard for his okc team mate Westbrook.   Westbrook just wasn’t someone that Daryl would acquire otherwise. If they wanted off of cp3 I felt they could have done it for something else that helped.
"No its, Steve Nash and Chris Paul!"
"Key word: Usually. He's only averaged 10+ assists per game in one year, whereas others like Harden, Westbrook, Chris Paul, Rondo have done it multiple times in their careers."
"No. But, if they ended up keeping Chris Paul, instead of trading for Russell, I think they would have won it all."
Averaged 35 against them on 60 TS% with a worse team and Chris Paul having one of the worst years of his career?
"I don’t buy those reports lol, if that were the case why would they randomly include Paul, let alone trade him + a bunch of picks.  At that time Chris Paul was injured regularly and the common narrative was that his contract was going to look really ugly in a couple years. Paul was a negative asset at that time, even if he ended up turning it around and proving that narrative very wrong."
"Depending on how severe it is, it can be a real issue. Chris Paul suffered a hamstring strain in 2018 and look at him now. Sure his gameplay isn’t the same as the past, but you gotta consider in age and other factors. Regardless, he did something most would call quits after. He pushed, so will KD; and in my opinion even harder due to the kind of player he is."
"Booker isn’t HoF yet lol  But you answered your own question, the Suns have two stars in Chris Paul and Booker so it wouldn’t be as shocking as the Pistons  Although facing these Lakers and Nets would be more than that Pistons team had to go through."
"It was both, but it was moreso to dump Chris Paul in a way that allowed you to continue to compete"
"Lebron, Steph, Chris Paul"
"so after the 2015-16 season?  Steph, KD, Chris Paul and Carmelo"
Probably just KD and Chris Paul
I’m looking directly at Chris Paul for this one.
"well for a lot of these people Russ' box is the offense. That's all that matters and there's no sense in looking any deeper into it. Like for example, that the Wizards rank 21st in offensive rating this year. Last year they ranked 16th. Of course, it will always be someone else's fault that Russ' box score doesn't translate to team success. For a counterpoint look at Phoenix, which significantly improved its offensive rating by more than 3 points after Chris Paul joined the team."
"That Presti had the foresight to see this coming is easily worth a bonus in itself. The real insight from the PG trade is how it interacts with other trades and movements at the same time. Kawhi moving with another star was inevitably going to shift the balance of power in the league. If you KNEW that PG is moving, and you also are pretty certain that AD is moving, how does that affect the general balance of the league. How does interact with Horford being overpaid? With Harden wanting Chris Paul gone and knowing that Rockets ownership are incapable at business? With the Warriors losing KD and becoming powerless because of injuries? How about all of the other bad contracts in the league?  Presti apparently has a lot of experience in asset management. So the question in the moment becomes: You know the price you could get for PG. and you know Westbrook has a particular price tag because of Harden, so is there a way to take that scarcity and use it as a way to build capital, much in the way shorting a stock helps you build capital."
Okay Chris Paul.  But yeah it ain't untrue
Chris Paul is top 10 too
"I wouldn't put Shaq or Wilt in the top 5 as far as impact. Neither has played on even a top 100 offense all time if you go by Otrg. Both were dominant scorers and great defensive players, but not top 5 in terms of impact. Top 5 imo is MJ, LeBron, Curry, Nash, Magic in some order, with Harden, Kobe, Chris Paul, Bird next. I'd put Wilt and Shaq after that in terms of impact.  As far as unstoppable individually though, Shaq and Wilt are definitely top 5."
You guys fouled on a lot of them and Chris Paul didn’t even play. You don’t win if he plays
You already know nash is overrated when he got the same amount of mvps as shaq and kobe combined. That being said he was excellent on offense but terrible on defense. Chris Paul is great on offense and great on defense. Overall as a player CP3 is better.
"I’ll take Chris Paul for the defense, but you can’t go wrong either way"
Chris Paul- playoff choker.  Monty Williams- losing playoff record  Ayton and Booker- 0 playoff experience
Ending up indirectly trading T.J. Warren for Chris Paul.  Warren to Pacers for cash considerations/aka cap space for Rubio.  Rubio to Thunder for CP3
Him getting touched on the back of the head and lying on the floor like he got shot is more funny than anything Chris Paul has ever done lol. Even left the game too
Regular season superstar Chris paul
Champ move but Chris Paul is too pro for sure
Chris Paul mvp? Why not?
man you can't take that seriously when its exactly the kind of thing chris paul would do
"Yeah I think it’s another IT situation. Small players like that who are scorers and aren’t floor generals, like Chris Paul, struggle as they age. I think maybe the Celtics hoped they could get him off the ball and have Hayward do more distributing, but that didn’t work. You didn’t even mention that Kemba is a defensive mismatch against every team every time down the floor. I figured it would eventually be a problem, but I’m surprised by how quickly I was proven correct."
"Can't wait for the next ""Chris Paul opting out this summer to join the Heat, Mavericks"" piece after this big win.   Clowns."
GG Suns!  Chris Paul is a master and I'm always nervous when we go up against him.
yes because chris paul was the first option on the rockets. we all saw how good bobcat was in the playoffs
"Everybody saying Chris Paul needs to opt out of the final year of his contract (lol) or wait it out in Phoenix to finally ring chase as a bench vet or role player.  Na, this man tryna get this shit done right here in Phoenix. He's going for the chip."
Where’s Chris Paul overrated
"Ever since he moved to Houston, Chris Paul has become so much more likeable"
"Excellent game. Chris Paul hates the Jazz and I'm here for it.  If we shoot even league average from three we win, but kudos to Phoenix for clamping down from there. We really need to figure out what to do when that happens, as it looks like more and more of an exploitable weakness every game. Maybe just pass the ball to Rudy and let him do his thing? Seems like we forget he's on the court on offense.  If we get either the Suns or the Nuggets at any point in the playoffs I'm going to love it as a fan of basketball but hate it as a fan of my heart being able to keep beating for a seven game series.   GG Phoenix. Kinda hate you guys but also love you guys too."
"As a jazz fan,Good ass game between 2 great teams. Great win by the suns, Chris Paul did his thing! I’m very excited to see what these two teams can accomplish come playoff time."
"I mean Houston was a championship contender with Chris Paul and a middling playoff team with Westbrook, OKC stayed  pretty much the same even after losing PG, and we know his impact. The proof is in the pudding."
Chris Paul is a winner!
Chris Paul is just too much. We couldn't find our groove first half
Chris Paul still got it
"Can Chris Paul stop being so fucking good please? I swear he’s a god every time he plays the Jazz, probably because the way our guys choose to defend screens involving him is absolutely awful"
"Can Chris Paul stop being so fucking good please? I swear he’s a god every time he plays the Jazz, probably because the way our guys choose to defend screens involving him is absolutely awful"
Chris Paul is my dad.
"""*You can't ice me.*"" - Chris Paul"
"4.) Chris Paul has some pretty glaring playoff failures. Not saying it’s all on him 💯 but they need to be taken into account when we talk about greatest. CP3 is a great, but I hate to tell you he definitely isn’t the greatest."
chris paul is really good but not *that* good lmao
You can hate Chris Paul...and I do.
"Chris Paul, you are the Man."
Rockets started their downfall as soon as they traded Chris Paul
Chris Paul carving up Utah defense.  Jesus
Thunder was not a Top 5 team and Chris Paul was their leader. Checkmate.
Leave freaking Chris Paul open in overtime good call
Chris. Paul.
CHRIS PAUL
CHRIS PAUL IS MY DAD
Fuck Chris paul
CHRIS MOTHER FUCKIN PAUL
Terrible play.  Chris Paul has been the most reliable playmaker late in this game.  Should have put the ball in his hands to create something.
Why did they not let Chris Paul take the shot?   Booker been chucking it he last couple mins of this game
"Oh man if you are the Sun's, you gotta go Chris Paul right there."
"Damnit, Tied with 10 seconds, and Chris Paul is going to take a mid range buzzer beater."
Perfectly set for Chris Paul to hit the midrange for the win. It's insane how he's consistently money on that short pull up.
DO NOT GIVE CHRIS PAUL A MID RANGE JUMPER TO DECIDE THE GAME
Lakers didn't break any rules either in getting Chris Paul but that didn't stop Stern.
Chris Paul nasty
"Fucking Chris Paul. Damn it, man."
When exactly does Chris Paul miss?
Watching Chris Paul and Booker do their thing makes me sooooo grateful that Stern vetoed that Laker trade way back when.  Kobe/CP3/Howard would’ve been downright unstoppable.
Pretty sure Chris Paul still thinks Deron Williams is on the Jazz somewhere. He goes off on us all the time.
chris paul just throwing his body into a guy running should be an offensive foul
This has to be the most aggressive Chris Paul has been in months
They said booker is the best player on the suns earliers...na Chris Paul. He changes teams
God damn Chris Paul and his God damn midrange jumpers.
"Fuck I hate supporting teams playing Chris Paul, never comfortable."
Chris Paul with the savy veteran move
"no chance lol if chris paul is even remotely in the conversation then booker is definitely not even in the race, you can't have two MVP candidates on one team. Jokic is by far the MVP of his team at least"
"2 words: Chris Paul Point Guard Extraordinaire, Man Among Men and Defender of the Realm"
Chris Paul is good.  Edit: God**
This will be Booker's first year in the playoffs and Mitchell has never missed them. The only reason Booker is making the playoffs this year is because Chris Paul doesn't miss the playoffs. I'll take the consistency.
The title might confuse people who don't follow the NBA and don't know who Chris Paul is
"They’re saying mitchell and Booker should be in the mvp conversations, but neither are MVPs of their own team. Chris Paul and Rudy Gobert both are much more impactful for both squads."
"When Chris Paul has been knocked out of the playoffs it’s not been because he underperformed, it’s been because his knees are made of glass."
It’s so wild seeing gobert affect literally every shooter but chris paul
Shit Chris Paul would make me look short
I always thought I was too short to play basketball but Chris Paul exists
"chris paul, kyrie, luka, harden, lowry, jrue, ben simmons, trae, ja.  in no particular order&gt;russ"
"Harden, Luka, Chris Paul, Kyrie, Ben Simmons, Trae Young, SGA"
For the first time in the history of the nba Chris Paul has missed two consecutive mid range shots
Chris Paul done wonders for booker
Chris Paul is so good
Chris Paul. Russ is still probably top 5 though.
Chris Paul is currently the most overrated player in the NBA. The Suns would’ve been just fine this season without CP3. He is getting all the recognition for joining the right team at the right time. We all saw them go 8-0 in the bubble. They also had Ayton suspended for 25 games. They were a playoff team last season.
"The ceiling of Chris Paul is massively overrated. He has never shown himself to be in the league of Nash (let alone Curry) in being able to lead a team to playoff success.   Yes, he's an extremely good guard but quite a bunch of other guards have impacted the game more than he does.   For the past 5+ seasons he hasn't been anything beyond an all-star guard. Just passing+defense on smalls doesn't cut it anymore when teams want switching + shooting from their guard."
I want jazz to win strictly for seeding purposes. I'm a big Booker and Chris Paul fan though.... I just want that second seed.
"So guys like Chris Paul, D-Wade, Jerry West, Elgin Baylor etc wouldn’t be allowed in?"
"You know the truth man, stop resisting it. Let it speak to you. Chris Paul is not awesome"
"You know the truth man, stop resisting it. Let it speak to you. *Chris Paul is awesome*"
"Well, Chris Paul could turn down $44 million if he gets a big enough promise..."
"This. I give a lot of credit to Chris Paul and that also means I wonder how good the Suns can be if he leaves or has to take a step back in his role. Like, how long is this window and how far can they go? I'm not sure. But they're very good right now."
"&gt;The Rockets were forced to play Harden-ball because Harden refused to do anything else.  definitely not because they had a litany of injuries to their alternate playmaker (chris paul) and to their second and best scorers (capela/gordon) and had to play a rotation of g-league players (Hartenstein, Green) or players who are no longer in the league (Nene, Faried)  clearly mcw should've been taking the big shots for the good of the team"
"Chris Paul played 10+ minutes in the 4th, and Devin nearly 6. It's weird that you're acting like it's some huge blowout, but again, it's a regular season game. Surely we don't think Cavaliers would beat the Nets in the playoffs, right?"
Stretch to call him an 'elite' playmaker. Compare his assist to turnover ratio with an actual elite playmaker like Chris Paul. He makes too many risky passes trying to float by with his talent
"Lmao, you really don’t really believe they won 16 extra games mostly in part to a coaching change? What about the guy averaging 27/12/6?  This logic should’ve disqualified harden in 2018 then, they won 67 games mostly because Chris Paul played (most of the season) with him"
"Funniest thing about Chris Paul being loved now is that he is universally known as a dirty player and shithead but now he’s beloved it’s hilarious.   FWIW, paul is an all time guard while ben simmons can’t shoot outside of the paint."
James Harden or Chris Paul
Just give it Chris Paul to make up for the Kobe thing
lol Chris paul universally loved back to the drawing board nephew
Because Chris Paul can actually do shit on offence in the half court besides LARP as Ben Wallace
Because you can't see how much better playmaker Chris Paul is in stats. Not knock against Simmons who is also great passer but the way Paul makes his teammates better is on another level.
"boxscore doesn't tell any story about offensive impact. Chris Paul is much better offensive player. Donovan Mitchell isn't near Kawhi Leonard on this side of the ball either despite similar numbers  but yes, Ben is definetly overhated and i have no idea why. It seems like people are just waiting for his bad games/stretch just to shit on him and spam ""Haha playoffs HCO 2nd round cloging paint keke"""
because chris paul is a 6 foot 35 year old while simmons is a 6'11 athletic freak in his prime yet paul is still more impactful
(Top 20 HoF odds for current players)  1.	LeBron James	1.0000 2.	Chris Paul	1.0000 3.	Kevin Durant	1.0000 4.	James Harden	0.9997 5.	Stephen Curry	0.9996 6.	Russell Westbrook	0.9992 7.

3-1 gangbang with OKC Russ flair and Clippers Chris Paul flair
Chris Paul sees beyond it
Anecdotally there a lot of weird cases like Paul George and Chris Paul where they became good shooters by like year 3 at latest but as rookies specifically shot low %s
"A bit Chris Paul-esque coming out of school - great D, great handles, a bit undersized"
"I watched that entire season. Their strength was defence not offense, they were a top 10 defensive team due to Roberson, Adams, and Dipo (who you guys labelled as a defensive pest). Was still a great season by Westbrook but it’s one season, his teams got dramatically better the following three seasons and he declined slowly ever year following 2017. Also don’t get started on the playoffs.  You clearly didn’t watch Chris Paul, he’s been better at literally everything while being an elite playoff performer. Paul and Harden had a 43-4 record when they played together in 2018. Only team to actually challenge a fully healthy Warriors with KD and Paul played a huge part in that."
I mean chris paul should make it atleast 2nd team if suns became the first seed lol
Curry has a 65% TS. Harden has a 64.5%. Nice try using splits and ignoring TS lol  Oh so he stat padded his to a 35/7 on 60% TS series in 2019 and he passed his way to going up 3-2 on the warriors lol. They got lucky as shit. Durant bailed curry out. Chris Paul bailed curry out. Harden has been the better player every season since 2016  He’s not outplaying shit
"Chris Paul didn’t play and we lost the game by 9. Funny of you to act like he wouldn’t dramatically change the game and make us win  Harden carried the whole time in 2019, Paul was ass the whole time and curry got carried by Durant and had one good game and gets all the credit. Bullshit lmao.  Oh so when it’s harden it’s assist chasing right? It’s okay if you’re scared to admit hardens impacted the game more in his time this season. But you don’t have to start making shit up. The funny part is they’re about equally as effecient too so you can’t use that as an advantage.  Steph isn’t doing shit now that he isn’t on a  super team"
"Lol no. Curry has plenty of playoff chokes, his teams have always been good enough to make up for it. Harden would have beat him in 2018 if Chris Paul played, he was up 3-2. Harden  played way better then steph in 19 too, the difference was one guy had KD and one guy had CP3 in his worst season since he was a rookie  And Westbrook? Really? Did you even watch the playoffs?  And lol no, harden is averaging double the assists Curry is and more rebounds while scoring 6 less PPG, you don’t have that going for *you*"
"I think he's incredibly deserving but he's going to face some stiff competition. The All-Star teams are set up to allow a maximum of 6 guard selections.      I think Curry, Lillard, Luka and Mitchell are all locks at this stage. Devin Booker or Chris Paul will likely make it due to the Suns early season success and improvement from last season. That leaves Fox to compete with guys SGA and Conley amongst guards and front court players (for a wildcard spot) like Zion, Ingram and Derozan.      At this stage of the season he has my vote and if the Kings continue their recent form (wins in 7 of their last 9 games) then it'll be hard to leave him out."
"Lol did you watch the 2019 playoffs? Harden averaged 35 and 7 on 60% TS and the series went 6 with every game decided by 6 points or less. This is with Chris Paul playing like garbage for 5/6 games BTW. Couldn’t beat his man, couldn’t create bc of the switching, bad efficiency, couldn’t keep up as much on defense etc. put lebron fucking James in this spot and what happens? Not to mention they get lebron James, an agile 6’8 athletic freak to throw at KD and he can be even more locked in since he knows James can score at will   This team would be *way* better then any of those cavs teams. The 2018 version of the rockets when Chris Paul was a step quicker and they had a couple more 6’8 bodies they had golden state down 3-2 won 65 games and would have won until cp3 went down.   Harden&gt;&gt;kyrie, he literally was reigning MVP and deserved it again for averaging 36 and 8, love was dog shit against golden state every round, capella &gt;&gt; Thompson, tucker, EG, house, rivers, all guys who played well against the warriors scheme. Harden + bron and all of them dismantle every team in the last 20 years, elite defense that can actually switch every action and iso/spread PNR the shit outta the other team for 48 mins"
"Lebron was healthy for playoff time that season. I have no clue how the salary works but assuming you just throw lebron on the team and trade paul and picks away you’d basically have the same team except with lebron instead of a Chris Paul who heavily regressed in 2019.   That was arguably hardens best season ever, lebron probably wouldn’t even be first option that season james put up 36 and 8 and did the same in the playoffs. That’s how good that team was"
"Beal, Chris Paul, Booker, Lavine, KAT, Hayward, are all guys I’d rather want on my team"
Chris Paul was measured at 6’1 without shoes.
Some of the clippers game where Chris Paul was out had blake handling the ball some times. I always thought they should try giving him the chance to play point or point forward. Like an upper middle class Lebron.
"**2004:** Dwight Howard, Andre Iguodala.  **2005:** Chris Paul, Lou Williams.  **2006:** LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, JJ Redick, Rajon Rondo, PJ Tucker, Paul Millsap.  **2007:** Kevin Durant, Al Horford, Mike Conley, Jeff Green, Thad Young, Jared Dudley, Marc Gasol.  **2008:** Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, Danilo Gallinari, Eric Gordon, DJ Augustin, Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez, JaVale McGee, Serge Ibaka, Nicolas Batum, George Hill, DeAndre Jordan, Goran Dragic.   2009 with James Harden and Steph Curry is probably the end point?"
"From what i see, Champ values the experience and winning culture more so they’d play out his contract unless chris paul kinda demands it and if there’s a viable trade."
"That's not true, before Chris Paul came the rockets were consistently closer to the top of the league in pace. Per bbref, in 2016-17 they were 3rd in the league in pace, 15-16 they were 7th, 14-15 they were 2nd, 13-14 they were 5th, and 12-13 they were 1st. That's not to say he doesn't prefer playing slower now, but definitely not accurate to say he's never played fast."
"Just making a quick list (not very accurate) I’d put him in the 20-30 range. Your 16-22 range seems a little too optimistic.  Embiid, Giannis, Middleton, Durant, Harden, Kyrie, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Capela, Bam Adebayo, Gobert, LeBron, AD, Kawhi, Paul George, Chris Paul, DeRozan, Damian Lillard, Jokic, Steph, Christian Wood, Zion, Luka  That’s 24 players. All of these players besides Bam are on a team with a better record then the Knicks. You could probably put him over a few of them though.  Ben Simmons, Sabonis, Gordon Hayward, Lavine, Beal, Conley, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Fox  There’s 9 players kind of in that same range. Maybe below, maybe above Randle depending on your argument."
I think he’ll be a taller Chris Paul
Chris Paul is smaller than Steph and I don't see him getting criticised for being a bad defender
"It’s sad. He was legit my favorite player next to D Rose. I never thought they’d ever be on the same team and I’d neglect watching them. It’s also crazy that, just less than three years ago, they both scored their career-high 50 point games.   I miss the PnP routine him and Chris Paul were having on the Clippers. He slowly became a point forward and it was just great to see. Really sad to see how much injuries have messed his game up. He almost seems demotivated to even play anymore."
"Yep, Chris Paul arrived only a year later, so I guess the percentage of terrible lobs went down considerably."
"Sad story. Blake Griffin was the reason I started watching NBA. I remembered people compared him to Dominic Wilkins aka the human highlight reel, and on one episode of ESPN SAS(?) were gave him a list of nick names including things like Blake Superior etc while good 'ole Skip Bayless stayed true to his name and predicted, during Blake's first season, that he is going to be no more than a poor man's Dennis Rodman. Little did we know that Blake's first season without injury was also the height of his career, and his basketball legacy takes the same trajectory as the popular boy who peaked in high school. Some flashy dunks and no so deep runs in the play off were all he, Chris Paul and the lob city team will be remembered for. Despite all that I would like to remember Blake as the man who single-handedly made the LA Clippers team relevant, the only person who dunked over a freaking car. FWIW I hope he'll find solace knowing that he is also Steve Ballmer's favorite Clipper of all time."
"I’m sorry, but you can make anyone look good by saying stats and then comparing them to other players. Ex: “Jared Dudley has out scored Micheal Jordan in the last decade by over 100 times. Who’s the real goat?!” I’m not saying that he’s horrible, but I truly believe that Russ is better by a margin. If we put Russ and CP3 in a 1 on 1 game, I think Russ beat him badly. But Chris Paul knows how to give Dimes, so we have to give that to him. It’s a debate, but in my opinion Russ has helped his OKC team more than Chris Paul has ever helped his teams"
"I know what you mean, but it was the right call. Unnecessary from sexton too. That’s some Chris Paul/Lou will type cheap play lol"
"Seeing that my last lineup posts were like this kinda hurts:  &gt; Nance is back from his wrist injury tonight! Let's hope for him to be ok.   \+   &gt; Shortest injury report of the season :')  &gt; And almost close to just one, I hope.  But oh well, sadly Nance is out for 4~6 weeks now, so let's hope for him to be alright!  ---  Anyway, expected lineups for the night:  &amp;nbsp;  **Expected Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (10-14) | [](/PHX)Suns (13-9) ---|---   D.

Nader   (OUT)  L. Nance (OUT) |  Chris Paul    (OUT)  |  C. Payne    (OUT)  |  D. Saric   (OUT)"
"He is one of those players that are kind of frustrating because he could be so much better.   In college as a freshmen he was a 20/11 player with 65% TS. That is rare company and has the potential to be a 25 point scorer in the NBA. He supposedly has a [43.5 inch vert](https://twitter.com/deandreayton/status/912502520609521664?lang=en) with elite length. Ricky Rubio made Nikola Pekovic make a lot of money and gave Kevin Love his best years. Chris Paul is Chris Paul. How isn't he a 20+ scorer by now? We can't use the excuse that he hasn't had pg's that can pass. By the time Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard, Joel Embiid, Kevin Garnett, and Giannis were 22 years old they were all 20 ppg+ scorers already. Many of us were hoping he would turn into them and his first two years he had a trajectory that he might but then going back down to 14 ppg is a little disappointing. However, the Suns play a super slow pace with Chris Paul and have bottom 5 lowest possessions per game in the NBA when last year they were top 10 so everyone's stats is going to go down a little bit. Additionally, the Suns have a lot of mouths to feed with 7 players scoring in double digits (6 players if you don't count Dario who only played 6 games)."
Like 3/5 of a Chris Paul
"WHAT? bro tell who is above KG? WEST? 1-9 finals record DR. J? STeph maybe  wilt? elgin Baylor? Chris PAUL, Kawhi? MOSES MALONE? AI? DIRK? KARL MALONE? DAVID ROBINSON? CHARLES BARKLEY? WADE? STOCKTON? None of these players other than curry are better than kd"
"Did Barkley make one?  Otherwise, Chris Paul."
"Suns fan here, can confirm, Booker should not be an all-star this year  Chris Paul, on the other hand..."
"Kyle Lowry, Chris Paul is ~20 ppg, SGA, Brogdon, Ben Simmons/Lebron if you count them as PG,"
A little less then the Chris Paul deal I would assume
Chris Paul Victor Oladipo Jimmy Butler Kristaps Porzingis Rudy Gobert
Chris Paul  Jrue Holiday  Ben Simmons  Jaren Jackson Jr  Kristaps Porzingis
What if the Chris Paul that voted is really Carlton pretending to be The New Chris Paul ^(TM)?
Now. Hear me out. Chris Paul to the Clippers. Totally will work out. Can you imagine CP3 in a Clippers uniform!?!     /s for all you boring busters.
"Crazy Stockton stats.  Stockton has 31% more all time assists than 2nd place Kidd, and 61% more than the active leader Chris Paul. Chris Paul's career high in assists for a season is 925. If he were to get 925 assists per season, he would need 6.5 seasons to pass Stockton. At which point he would be 42 years old. Last season Paul achieved 472 assists. If Paul were to get 472 assists per season it would take 12.66 seasons to pass Stockton, he would be 48 years old.  &amp;#x200B;  Stockton has 22% more all time steals than 2nd place Kidd, and 45% more than the active leader Chris Paul. Chris Paul's career high in steals for a season is 217. If he were to get 217 steals per season, he would need 4.65 seasons to pass Stockton. At which point he would be 40 years old. Last season Paul achieved 111 steals. If Paul were to get 111 steals per season it would take a little over 9 seasons to pass Stockton, he would be 45  years old.  &amp;#x200B;  Safe to say these records will not be beaten anytime soon if ever."
"Chris Paul was an MVP caliber player in his prime, and Stockton wasn't. I don't see why that's a laughable argument since that literally follows from their MVP voting tallies but you do you."
"This exactly. I could swear every single time any discussion involving Chris Paul or John Stockton popped up in this sub, a big chunk genuinely believed Stockton was *overrated* and CP3 would outplay him in any PG duel nowadays. It's just so wild to me people can give these takes so easily with Stockton having stat records in both steals and assists that are nearly untouchable."
"chris paul, Kawhi? Youre trippin. And he’s definitely not better than PG right now"
"I dont deny it and I wouldnt have had an issue with lebron winning it. In fact MVP to me means most valuable player to your team meaning if you take them off how much worse is the team as a whole? I think lebron should have won it in 2018, and Harden should have won MVPs in 2015, and 2019. But I have no problem with harden winning it in 2018 best record and all, lead the league in ppg, keep in mind chris paul was out for a good chunk of the RS as well along with other injuries houston had. Again it varies but my original point is he wasnt robbed at all and the players who did win the MVPs those years deserved them."
"You suggested that I don't know what it takes to become a hall of famer, and then listed criteria which are *definitively not* what it takes to become a hall of famer.   * Chris Mullin  * T-Mac  * Dikembe Mutombo  * Dan Issel  * Bob Lanier  * Artis Gilmore  * Allen Iverson  * Bernard King  * Nate Thurmond  * George Gervin  * Pete Maravich  * Reggie Miller  * Dominique Wilkins  * Patrick Ewing  * John Stockton  * Charles Barkley  * Karl Malone  * Elgin Baylor  * Steve Nash  Soon you'll probably also have Chris Paul, Vince Carter, Westbrook, Melo, and maybe PG. Harden if he doesn't win a chip.  &gt;Kat for example, will never win rings.  I wonder how many of these baseless, over-confident claims you'd take a 20:1 bet on.  &gt;Tatum is hands down more surefire than Trae cause he plays winning basketball on both ends of the court.   Now in February, I agree."
Pretty much the story arch of Chris Paul since his time in Houston.
"Stockton is closer to 16K.   Rank | Player | Assists  1 | John Stockton | 15,806  2 | Jason Kidd | 12,091  3 | Steve Nash | 10,335  4 | Mark Jackson | 10,334  5 | Magic Johnson | 10,141  6 | Oscar Robertson | 9,887  7 | CHRIS PAUL | 9,831  8 | LeBRON JAMES | 9,533  13 | RUSSELL WESTBROOK | 7,424  15 | RAJON RONDO | 7,269"
Game 1 DJ is basically prime Chris Paul
The crazy thing about him is when you watch him play he's really good but he doesn't look unworldly.    Like he doesn't do crazy shit. Just really fucking smart.  It would be equivalent to like Chris Paul just collecting championships.
"Stockton was Chris Paul, but with a longer career, more aggressive, just as big if not bigger impact on winning, who probably got in people’s heads better than Chris Paul. And Chris Paul is a top 5ish point guard off the top of my head. Stockton is number three all time IMO (I honestly think curry will go down as number 2 because of how he changed the game, with Magic at one, then Kidd, Thomas, Paul, and Nash 4-7 in any order). I know I’m getting ahead of myself with curry but I think that’s how it will go down when all is said and done"
"Have you lost your. whaever all of you jordan fans are giving so much credit to him when you use literall no context your acting he is the undisputed goat, he is goat or second to kareem or bron. Gary payton is a PG. Jordan was also a midrange shooter you know, interior defense BEST TERMS 1980s are better in interior defense more physical, 2010s WAY MORE talent, 2000s WAY more talent than 1990s other than gary who else oh dennis rodman and pistons and WHO ELSE, Lakers no, Boston yes. Look buddy lebron played against in the finals 3 times, all time great defender 15 defensive selections tim duncan, best defensive era no 2000s-1980s and then 1990s look curry plays in 1990s averages 35-40 proof 3 ball nothing defended the 3 ball back then, kd can shoot from anywhere he want, lebron passing 3 ball and fadeaway he is averaging 26-30 ppg, harden what defense can stop his stepback 3, dirk who stops fadeaway, kobe you kinda no this one, IQ, impossible shot maker which means no defense stops this guy, insane fade and has every move in his arsenal. Kawhi insane defense a great scorer, Westbrook dunking and passing and rebounds, klay catch/shoot 3 easily averaging 23-25ppg. Chris paul insane passing and great scorer and defender, larry legend survived in a more physical era one of the greatest shooters in nba history, impossible shot maker, rebounding, passing insane, Magic survived a tougher era, un human passing, good scorer, rebounding, anybody else? Oh Kareem unblockable skyhook, all time great defender, leading scorer, won mvp while not even making the playoffs more to say? Damian lillard logo 3, passing free throws, young star trae young logo threes and passing. More Dwyne wade fadeaway, AI for god sake 38-40ppg a game in 1990s crossover, jumpshot handles, IQ, passing, Ray allen leading in 3s."
"Chris Paul might be the example of a current player who could have been even better in 90s ball system. He’s physical, can pick the pocket, great defender, add in hand checking and such, and a greater emphasis on midrange. Cp3 would crush"
"Relatively important but with context added that MVP's are narrative dependent.  Like everyone has said 100 times, realistically Lebron James based solely on impact could've been MVP almost every year since the late 2000's. People get tired of how great he is and chase narratives for the award instead.  They can't be the be all end all. Nash isn't a better Point Guard than Chris Paul because he had 2 and Paul had none. There are a lot of other things that play into it. As a baseline thing having them definitely helps but it doesn't thwart a mound of evidence in another direction."
He won more than Chris Paul. Not winning hasnt stopped the CP3 point god narratives etc
But Giannis could easily make a finals over the next 10 years. Giannis is better than Nique and Gervin. For his career he is behind Chris Paul and probably a bit behind Nash too. He will pass both with good health imo.
"Wdym, muggsy had a solid career. How tf wouldn't Chris Paul thrive in an era who's solid offensively and defensively"
And Chris Paul.
Chris Paul
"Jimmy Butler, Giannis, Joel Embiid, Donovan Mitchell, Chris Paul, Zach LaVine, Zion Williamson"
It's Chris Paul or Steve Nash. George Gervin and Nique are very close as well. Dominique Wilkins is however by far the greatest player to never make a conference finals.
Paul averages more points steals and assists 9x all nba 9x all-defense 6x steal champ 4x assist champ to Nash 5. Chris Paul is definitely equal if not a better offensive player than Nash
"Chris Paul, Magic, Steph, Immanuel Quickley the usual suspects"
Idk about old players but in our era probably Chris Paul.   I may be missing someone obvious though.
"Oh yeah cause he’s a shooting guard lol go get ready for school and go double check your stats young man. Also trae young is a usual 20+ 10+ assists man. Chris Paul, Fox, lamelo ball, Fred van fleet lol all better team players then currys bum ass. Go back to beating off to his wife ya clown 🤡"
"Chris Paul, Harden, Jimmy Butler, Giannis, Jokic"
"Lol we’re not gonna be offering Ben, and there’s no way anyone else is offering something worth more than Ben.  Lowry is 34 and on the last year of his deal, go look at the return for Chris Paul if you want a sense of what he’s worth."
"What’s his current trade value? I’d guess the closest comparison would be Chris Paul, who went for a mix of role players and a first round pick."
"Man, it seems like poor Kemba has a losing streak against everyone: Lebron, Simmons, Chris Paul!"
awwww:( if only chris paul didn’t lose a leg
"It's Chris Lebron Paul 3, still no signs of slowing down too.  CP3 and the Suns are holding up their expectations for now and it's great!"
What does this even mean lol  Chris paul is 6'0 on a good day and played phenomenal defense most his career
Chris Paul didn't get State Farm insurance on 24-point leads?
Chris Paul forgot to pay his State Farm insurance on 24-point leads?
Chris Paul suppose to be this floor general?    How y’all losing to a depleted nets team on a back to fuckin back
Chris Paul is an all star. 🥲
Chris Paul really wants to beat Harden.
What an absolute fucking choke lol yikes Suns.  Surprised everyone's favorite player who's so clutch Chris Paul didn't take over 🤔
chris paul should be taking that shot.
and here I thought Chris Paul was gonna save them from blowing this lead
why didn’t they give it to chris PAUL????
Chris Paul taking his foot of the gas was a mistake.
Chris Paul didn't get State Farm insurance on 24-point leads?
Chris Paul is an idiot for this and the players should honestly just not go. They all make enough to not care about the fine and fuck protecting the average player's future earnings in this circumstance.
Chris Paul needs a ring.  Anyone he plays for is an instant contender.  No matter how bad they were before him
nah Chris Paul tryna beat me up way too funny lmao
Mike Conley isn’t even the poor mans chris Paul
"I don't believe Chris Paul is 6 feet. He's closer to 5'10"" or 11"" according to most people who've stood next to him. So that's only an inch or two since LeBron is 6'9""."
Chris Paul would’ve 3 to four inches taller than Bron in this scenario. Makes a big difference.
yeah he'd be like Chris Paul or some shit with more strength and a little less speed (considering hornets CP3 is insanely fast) but he'd be in the NBA
Chris Paul
It’ll just fuel him to keep calling teams out. This man has the players best interest at heart and after Chris Paul he should take over.
Chris Paul
"Booker has consistently been better than Mitchell before this season, and better than Lavine as well. I have no problem admitting that Booker has been worse than Lavine and about on par with Mitchell this season.  I do think that had more to do with adjusting to Chris Paul than anything else and I expect him to be back to his usual self from here on out, but who knows."
That's bs. Curry paved the way for his style of scoring. There is absolutely nothing he could have done to put up the volume he does now in his early years. The fact he got the green light to put up the 3 point volume he does and change the way the entire game is played should be seen as a positive not a negative. If the next guard who plays like Steph gets the green light to shoot 3s immediately and averages 40% from 3 on 26ppg will he be a greater scorer than Steph? Of course not.     It's unfair to hold the 5 years before Steph changed the league against him when discussing his scoring volume. If Chris paul for example started the 3 point revolution then curry would have shot 3s from his rookie years and averaged much higher volume. But would not changing scoring in the nba more than any player in nba make Steph a greater scorer? I don't think so. You have to put this shit into context. Averaging up a players ppg and deciding who's the best scorer based on that might work 10% of the time but Curry's definitely a prime example of one of the 90% of players that strategy doesn't work for.
"Almost impossible to judge him compared to other PFs because of how different his role is. As a fan of a team badly in need of a facilitator, watching Draymond is like torture. His IQ is off the charts on both ends and that entire offense runs through him. He's Chris Paul or LeBron on offense but without any of the scoring ability. How do you even compare the value of that to someone like KP lol"
"There is no doubt Europe has the advantage in the front court, but The gap between AD and Jokic isn’t as big when you factor in defense, and you are underselling the overall disadvantage Europe has.  Europe has a great team, but the US has an insane team. Lebron, Steph, and Kawhi are too much regardless, and the US “B team” PG, Kyrie, KD, Dame, Kat would probably beat the Euro starters too. That’s without even including Harden, Devin Booker, Chris Paul, Bradley Beal, Jaylen Brown, etc."
True... What about Mike Conley? Or Chris Paul?
"I agree with you in that Curry has had much more help throughout his career than Harden, which can explain much of his success. That's why I believe that, when rating them, while I still believe Steph is better, it's an extremely slim margin. Something like a 96 vs a 95 overall if you know 2k. Yet, I feel Curry has shown he has another gear that Harden simply doesn't have. As long as KD was on the warriors and they were healthy, no one was gonna beat them. In 2018, they had their chance, and unfortunately Chris Paul got injured, so we never got to see what would happen. However, in 2019, Harden truly had his chance. KD went down in game 5, and the Rockets could have taken the lead in that series. And yet, Steph stepped in up in the 4th, outplayed Harden, and got away with that game. Then, in Game 6, the Rockets had another chance. At this point, the rosters were similar in strength, as Harden had CP3 and a better bench, while Curry had Klay, Draymond, and a weaker bench. And yet again, Steph outplayed Harden when it mattered most, scoring 33 in the second half and hitting dagger after dagger while Harden struggled until it was too late. That moment was when it was cemented that Steph &gt; Harden. And there's plenty of other stuff, such as the Warriors Championship in 2015, when Klay and Dray weren't All-NBA level, and Dray wasn't even an All-Star. Then, in 2016, we saw Curry lead the warriors to 73 wins in what I would consider to be one of the highest offensive peaks of all time. While Harden may be putting up more impressive counting stats over these last few years, Curry's countless achievements make him the greater player."
*Chris Paul
ah yeah it's not even close that their leading scorer was their best player. must have been that notorious ball hoging choker Chris Paul.
Chris Paul and lebron
"i thought chris paul and harden, together, would be awful also."
"For now, yes, he would, but eventually Chris Paul will retire. That's why I think there's a fair argument for a solid combo guard to be drafted, that others have claimed in this thread.   Focusing on Halliburton, I agree, his best opportunity is in Sacramento. He probably wouldn't put up these numbers in Phoenix with CP3 running the team."
So was Chris Paul. He was also taking like 4 less 3's a game. Totally different role.
Chris Paul is a journey man traveling franchise to franchise to drag them to the playoffs
"Context matters here. He’s playing like he’s Joel Embiid. He’s more like Deandre Jordan. Except instead of having Chris Paul he’s had Reggie Jackson and Sexton who have objectively been two of the worst passing starting PGs in recent history. At the peak in Detroit he shot 65% around the rim. I think if he’s paired with a good passing PG and sticks to screening/cutting/crashing the glass he’ll be a way more efficient ~15 PPG scorer than what he is now. He can’t finish post ups, layups, ISO’s (anything that requires touch) but he’s a fantastic lob finished when he just needs to dunk and not finish off the dribble. I think he’d be a great pairing for a PG like Lamelo who would flourish as a lob passer with an athletic freak at the 5.   The Cavs started the season pretty well when Drummond was engaged. He’s been a centerpiece of (crappy) playoff teams. He’s just an average center getting paid as an all nba one, but average would be an upgrade for a few teams."
"Thank you for Chris Paul, idk where we’d be without him and hopefully you can do something with all the assets you got back for him"
"There's a couple things here.  The first is that he isn't like old Dwight Howard where he demands the ball more and asks for a coach who recognizes his weakness to get fired.   He knows he's not great offensively and essentially feasts on scraps at that end of the floor (offensive rebounds and guys dumping the ball into his hands when the defense breaks down).   As to getting rebounds; he does that. More than anybody in the league over the last nine years. Since his rookie season, nobody has grabbed more rebounds than him in that time when you combine those nine seasons.   His screen setting could be better, but it's his offensive ineptitude that makes it harder. If he steps out to set a screen, his defender can stay back or step out to get ahead of the switch. There's no need to worry about him.  As to catching lobs, that has been an issue in part because he'd never played with a great point guard. Had he been a rookie with a guy like Chris Paul or LeBron, he'd be more adept at that sort of thing, but he played in a system that relied on a heavy dose of post play from Greg Monroe early (which didn't work for Monroe because Drummond's defender was always close at hand for a double team) or with Jennings and Smith, neither of whom were very interested in passing the ball.   &amp;#x200B;  People point out Drummond's offensive ineptitude, but it's like beating a dead horse.  He knows his limits, he doesn't force it, and he grabs almost as many offensive rebounds as he has missed FGs, so, statistically, his offensive game is actually pretty productive.   The issue is that his defender can lean off him and double his teammates easier, which makes things harder for his teammates on offence."
Imagine Chris Paul in westbrooks body
Making fun of Harden's manboobs will lead to bad things  -not Chris Paul
"I seriously, super duper doubt they “realized” anything about Blake. They knew his injury history, they knew how good he was. They signed that contract knowing they were going to try to get off him with probably the first good offer. It doesn’t make sense that they needed to see some games of Blake without Chris Paul on a team that was never going to contend and a team with high hopes like this was never tying themselves to Griffin at that point in his career."
"Kawhi ain’t coming, Chris Paul is not declining his option. Detox ab is horrible on defense, Holiday will be resigned and so will Conley."
"There are dozens of tons of players that would be better than KP @ 30 million. Chris Paul, Kawhi, Lowry, Conley, DeRozan, Holiday are all FA after this season."
Chris Paul  James Harden  Carmelo Anthony  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Patrick Ewing
PG: Chris Paul  SG: Reggie Miller  SF: Grant Hill  PF: Andrei Kirlenko   C: Patrick Ewing  Tried to give some focus to fit rather then purely talent
"Chris Paul Tracy McGrady Dominique Wilkins Charles Barkley Patrick Ewing  This team likely does not have the shooting, so might have to go with Harden in their for nique, and move McGrady to the 3."
"chris paul, harden, elgin baylor (?????), charles barkley, patrick ewing. my boy westbrook off the bench."
Lmfao dwight howard wasn’t even good. He was good for 1 year.  And Chris Paul? Didnt we win 65 games and go up 3-2 in the conference finals till he was injured? Lol.  Russ wasn’t more successful for shit. Everyone knows harden is easily the better player. You guys kept the worst of the big 3 and now they’ve teamed up again but without westbrooks trash ass
I was in the (then-Hornets) arena with my dad when Chris Paul was drafted and we agreed he was too short to ever really amount to much.
"6'3 curry , 6'4 west, 6'4 oscar, 6'4 wade,6'4 harden, 6'0 chris paul are legendary peaks too, specially curry"
"Not a player so much but a contract.  Chris Paul has been worth every cent of that late career contract so far. Guy was awesome in HOU, then in OKC, now in PHX. I (and most others) just viewed him as an albatross contract you'd have to pay to get rid of and eat at the end.  Is he worth 44M next year? Probably not that much. But I thought he would be basically toasted by then. He isnt. Hes still really fucking good."
"I wonder who on Dallas had the audacity to be chirping at Chris fucking Paul lol  Like, you're yelling at one of the greatest PGs of all time"
"I can respect that, but there's a good chance he becomes the next ringless John Stockton or Chris Paul without joining a super team."
Yeah I was just saying he’s actually been terrible on catch and shoot 3s the past 2 years which is weird. But yeah he’s gonna be someone like Chris Paul who his %s on 3s understate his shooting ability and also understate his gravity
You know what series would be exciting  Chris Paul Clippers revenge series
"I think the steph point is a fair one. He is not really a foul hunting type of player, he mostly plays without controversy, if anything he doesn’t seem to get the level of superstar calls commensurate with his status in the league. Chris Paul knee barged and hand checked him hard enough to get a misdemeanor assault charge in some of their playoff matchups with barely a whistle.  So it always looks funny when he tries something that other star players in the league are getting away with. And then when he doesn’t get the same call he looks ridiculous doing it, because those actions are ridiculous outside the context of a star player getting away with it.  Like he tried to imitate luka’s forward lunge into the defender trying to avoid the shooter (to no avail), and similarly he tried copying Hardens 3 step travel (Sorry, step back 3) and immediately got called for a travel. I’m glad he didn’t get into the flop after shooting the 3 craze or else he would be taking 30 free throws per game.  Either every player gets to take 3 step travels, and get foul calls every time they barrel down the lane or no player should get the benefit of the doubt. But it’s really frustrating to watch the game knowing special allowances are made for players to travel, get foul calls, etc and players with lesser reputations don’t get those same allowances."
Chris Paul was hyped up in New Orleans. Especially when they started winning a bit in like 2007. He was one of the most exciting players to watch and the team were pretty fun to watch.
I thought Chris Paul would be awful in OKC

AND a Chris Paul approved 2-for-1
"I think they're gonna be streaky until they iron out their personnel but it's tough. I think they'd be better without Bagley in the rotation but he played pretty well against the sixers when I watched that game. Tough to give up on him, look at Julius Randle. I think one thing they could do is play Haliburton more, I just think that kids a winner, doesn't have a single hole in his game. He's leading rookies in mins but he's coming off the bench. They should have Haliburton attached to Bagley. I just think Haliburton can make anything work. I don't say this lightly but I think Haliburton is basically 6'6 Chris Paul."
Yeah harden had Dwight Howard and Chris Paul with him during his failures. Definitely not two surefire hall of famers.
"Steve Nash, Chris Paul must see tv"
Why not?   Chris Paul had just as big an offensive impact while being All-Defense every season.   John Stockton never once was an MVP candidate in his entire career either
Laker fan here. We still wonder what would’ve happened if the Chris Paul trade would’ve gone through.
Is that you chris Paul
It's funny because I've never been a Suns fan or a Chris Paul or Devin Booker fan but I'm kinda finding myself heavily advocating for both CP3 and Book to make the All-Star game.      The Suns only won like 15 games two seasons ago and now with their current record they'd only be 1 game behind the 76ers for the \#1 seed in the East. Both of the Suns guards have been playing at an Allstar level and so when you combine that with a top 5 record in the league I think they really deserve to get in.
The coaches are 100% going to pick Chris Paul for one of those spots. I feel like the last spot will probably be Booker or Zion.
When has Chris Paul had tremendous success in the NBA RJ please tell me
"The same reason nobody cared about AD or Chris Paul. Rookie hype is over with, win and they'll remember he exists, momentarily. Right now they're not even in play in game territory."
Chris Paul is underrated
"TBF, anytime you have Chris Paul as your PG, you’ll be a COTY contender."
Chris Paul is an all star.
Option C: [Chris Paul](https://media.tenor.com/images/08c9d8ea81e379b5a29eee4358f85f10/tenor.gif)
"I think chris paul still has a chance to win a championship, you wouldn't call the suns a superteam but they have an outside chance in the next 2 years"
"So when someone asks you why the rockets lost, you won’t mention westbrook but will instead mention small ball (which literally only happened because of westbrooks limited playstyle)? You’ve got to be kidding me lmao. Yes we probably wouldn’t have won with Chris Paul. I never claimed we would though.   Yes, westbrook is not literally THE REASON we lost, there are other factors our team isn’t fucking perfect lol I’m not sure why I have to spell this out for you, you’re literally not even bothering to understand the point. There is no way you can deny that westbrook was the MAIN reason we lost; meaning he had **much** more to do with it then anything else.   Again, there you got making up random specific statements that I never said in the first place to try to prove your stupid argument is somehow right lmao. WHERE DID I SAY CHRIS PAUL WOULD LOCK UP LEBRON. I said he’d play much smarter defense and not **constantly** ball watch and leave lakers guards open for threes and cuts. Chris Paul is an elite defender for his size and those won’t happen with him on there.  Also, before the trade to houston people from westbrooks camp always pushed the ideology that westbrook was only inefficient because he never has any shooters. Turns out, he’s still a shit show in terms of efficiency if you put at 36/8/7 62% TS MVP and 3 other respectable shooters to give him a 5 out offense.   He absolutely performed like a G Leaguer in the playoffs, there was nothint gross or outlandish about that.  Westbrook isn’t good and you being frustrated about it doesn’t really change anything lol. Also, there’s no point in you arguing because you don’t have an argument to begin with."
"I’m just fucking frustrated at how completely nonsensical you are being. Bruh, if you admit that you would have lost with Chris Paul then you can’t tell me that WB was the sole reason you fucking lost. And it’s insane to me that you think 6’0 Chris Paul would play better defense on Lebron FUCKING James. And the fact that WB was paid 40 million doesn’t somehow make him MORE responsible, your FO chose to pay 40 mil to CP and then CHOSE to trade for WB because he was the only trade able player making similar money. If anything that makes the responsibility more on the FO than anything. Also calling WB’s play g-leaguer is such a gross fucking overreaction that I realize this argument is pointless because you obviously are so narrow minded as to never have a realistic viewpoint."
"I don’t know why, but I feel like we’re gonna get shredded by Chris Paul and I’m really not looking forward to that"
"Lmao are you a child or something?  Chris Paul probably doesn’t win us the series but he damn sure pushes it to 6-7, I know for a fact chris Paul would play smart defense even though he’s small. I know he wouldn’t have as many turnovers as assists. I know he wouldn’t be left wide open making things hard for the best player on the team, and I know he’d hit wide open catch and shoot three pointers at better then 20%, like russ. Or 50% from the line. Or an abysmal 40% TS lmao.   Westbrook isn’t good, and yes, he DOES take responsibility for it, because he was being payed like a super max player and produced like a g leaguer."
"Walt Frazier, Jason Kidd, John Stockton and Chris Paul were all unbelievable defenders at the guard position."
"IMO this falls into the “unnatural basketball act” category, the same way that Kobe used to swing his arms to the side to draw contact after the shot.   The point of setting a screen is to create an advantaged position for the offensive player. If a defender is trailing around a screen and the shooter voluntarily stops before coming around the screen and shoots early to create contact, or jumps *back towards the direction they just came from*, it can be reasonably argued that the offensive player only gave up their advantage to try and draw a foul and should not be rewarded.   It’s the same shit that Chris Paul does when he’s dribbling up court and then cuts off a trailing defender and stops on purpose to let himself get run over. It used to be the refs would just use the common sense eye test and swallow the whistle because it was frowned upon to foul-bait like that."
"okay Dwade was attacking the rim and going at people all the time, plus he didn’t really become Wade until like 05 when the last of the defensive rules were changed to curtail hand-checking, clarify blocking fouls and call defensive three seconds to open up the game (https://cdn.nba.net/nba-drupal-prod/nba-rules-changes-history.pdf)  Chris Paul is the same as D Wade.   I have multiple comments explaining how Manu Ginobilli’s flopping is one of the worst thing to happen to basketball and it’s why the Spurs were so hated in the early 2000s.   Reggie Miller was also pretty well-hated and i didn’t like reggie as a player then and i don’t like him now.   Laimbeer is one of the dirtiest players to ever play, what a great example    the fact of the matter is that in the era of the 80s to 2005, it was all about getting into the paint and attacking the rim. yes you had mid range jumpshots, but that’s when the drive or the post game didnt work. and they didn’t flop nearly as blatantly. they bitched about calls, but Marcus Smart is embarrassing the way he flops for how good of a player he is. same with LeBron. 100 times out 100 give me guys who drive into the lane and then try to beat some ass like Kermit Washington. watching Jimmy Butler roll around in pain laughing and tickling other players on the court feels like something out of Baseketball    watching guys shoot 36% from 3 isn’t fun.  they miss 60% of the time and i can get that at my local high school. NBA superstar Trae Young makes 42% of his shots. who in gods name wants to watch that? it’s just a free throw contest.   and missed jump shots are uber less exciting. what is more fun to watch: 6’6 220 pogo stick Desmond Mason miss a layup against 6’10 Chris Wilcox or Coby White and Jordan Clarkson trading pull-up 3 clanks?"
"Who? Like Ben Simmons? Mike Conley? Even Chris Paul? Those guys are all scoring similarly to Lonzo. Conley and paul a bit better (though Lonzo has a better eFG% than Paul), but those guys and long time vets.  Anyway, I don't know how you can watch lonzo and think it makes sense to not have him distributing the ball."
That was before he got chris Paul
&gt; with him leading.  Chris Paul is leading.
"Chris Paul is basically a better version of whatever coach is coaching a particular team, and it just so happens he is really good at playing the game also. Basketball IQ is through the roof."
"Uh, agree to disagree I guess. Even by the standards of the time Bowen was notably one of the dirtiest players in the NBA. Walking under Vince Carter multiple times, stepping on Kobe's wrist, kneeing Nash in the groin, kicking Chris Paul on the ground, the infamous Wally Szczerbiak kick to the face, injuring Jamal Crawford and Steve Francis on jump shots, kicking Amare Stoudemire in the achilles.   The NBA was more physical back then but he took things to another level fairly frequently."
"I really don't mean to come off as negative, I always appreciate people watching what/who they want, but it's pretty funny that you don't like foul baiting and flopping, and your alternative to watch is Chris Paul! CP invented the jumping backwards into the defender (or even worse running down the court then just stopping in front of the defender so they run into him)"
"Look, if Chris Paul is coming for you, you're gonna want a police presence."
"He's up there, but I think the addition of Chris Paul is where you're seeing more of the change coming from. That's just my opinion though."
"Exactly, as a huge fan of those rockets teams it was sometimes hard to watch them employ a 3-heavy strategy with so many subpar shooters. Haven't watched nearly enough of the Jazz this year but y'all seem almost like simply a better all-around version of the rockets teams that almost toppled the KD warriors (better 3 point shooting and defense), minus the singular star power of james harden and chris paul. Really excited to see how you guys fare in the playoffs"
Last season in OKC should show that Chris Paul very much is transforming teams he goes to.
"What? You literal hypothesis for why he ""underperforms"" was just debunked by that guy.   Harden plays fine in playoffs dude; let this narrative go. You can't even quantify it. He took the KD Warriors to 7 games with an injured Chris Paul helping and you're telling us he was an under-performer?   Nah."

Okay so I'm trying to process all of that.  So you're saying that Harden should be guarding power forwards? That's a pretty interesting idea I'm not sure how that would go And  I agree that Kyrie's defense isn't going to to make any all defense teams but it's not a detriment like someone like Trae Young for example.  And I'm not sure what you were implying about Deandre Jordan I think you are saying that his defensive game isn't that great and I would probably agree with you on that. I'm not sure if that's what you meant.  But this is essentially a Mike D'Antoni coached team of course Steve Nash is the head coach but D'Antoni is his top assistant and was Nash's Head coach during his best year's as a player and it's pretty much a version of his seven seconds offense that Nash played under and he taylored to James Harden later and all of the iterations defense was pretty much an elective course.  I'm not sure what to think about this Nets team on one hand this style of play has never been able to get a title The Rockets got pretty close with Chris Paul and Harden But the idea of the Three headed monster they have with KD Kyrie and Harden wonder's if they could out gun everyone else and maybe get a title.  Or maybe you can't get around fundimentals and defense always wins championships I guess we're going to see and I took an edible earlier and just realized I've been rambling writing a goddamn article about this shit and I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about so I'm going to end this here.
"Chris Paul is the best player on the Suns. Devin is the best scorer, but Chris is the most impactful player."
"No matter where Chris Paul is sent, he improves the team every single time."
"Chris Paul dropped off from a top 8 player to a fringe all-star (worst year of his career since rookie), and the team as a whole dropped off really hard defensively"
Chris Paul in 2018 was impeccable and playing so good in the playoffs that he looked like the best player in a series with steph kd and harden  Chris Paul in 2019 was a shell of himself who could barely get by kevon looney and just straight up looked washed at points  Chris Paul not playing at the level of 2018 is the biggest reason we dont have a championship
"Kinda Weird, mostly because of Bill Russell and Harden. But I don’t think mine is too much different.  PG: Chris Paul, close second is Nash  SG: Harden  SF: LeBron  PF: I’m just going to say Kevin Durant, even though I don’t think he’s ever been considered a PF. But If not him Tim Duncan  C: Hakeem"
"Hmmm that's interesting.  Chris Paul?  He just seems to always have the same type of game, never really deviates much from what he does"
Chris Paul?
"No. According to Sportskeeda, Chris Paul makes $8 million per year from his endorsements, including deals with State Farm, Nike, Air Jordan, Panini and Tissot."
Chris Paul is the king of this
Chris Paul  James Harden  Kawhi Lenoard  Charles Barkley  Hakeem
"Chris Paul, Dwyane Wade, Scottie Pippen, Charles Barkley, Hakeem Olajuwon"
"CP3   Harden    Kawhi    Dirk    Hakeem     CP3 and Harden have already shown that they can play together at an elite level, the 2018 Rockets were an all-time great team. And that was a 33-year-old Chris Paul.     So you start with two elite playmaking guards, both who can score efficiently, then you have Kawhi, the best wing defender of all time who can also create his own shot and score extremely efficiently as well. Then you have Dirk, one of the best shooters in NBA history, and Hakeem, an all-time-great defender while also being an incredibly efficient scorer.     All of these guys can create their own shot which makes this lineup next to impossible to guard."
"Kendrick Perkins was real good friends with Lebron since middle school. Believe it or not High School Rankings went 1. Lebron 2. Chris Paul 3. Kendrick Perkins. [yes 3](https://imgur.com/r8sgH)  &gt;Perkins first met LeBron James in the seventh grade when playing on the Houston Hoops and competing against Lebron's Ohio Shooting Stars. Perkins later became friends with Lebron during his time at ABCD Camp where they were teammates on the Oakland Soldiers. During his time on the AAU circuit beginning in eighth grade, Kendrick Perkins was ranked No. 3, LeBron at No. 1, and Chris Paul at No. 2."
"I know, I’m not denying any of those guys talents. They all are on all time great trajectory but I’ve witnessed the hype around 22 year old lebron. I’m not old enough to comment on young Kobe, Shaq, or Jordan but by that age, I would guess those guys were household names around the country because of the markets they were in.   But if you ask regular people who Zion, luka, Trae are right not, they wouldn’t have a clue. But ask those same people about 22 year old lebron and they would say he’s supposed to be the next Michael Jordan. As a bucks fan living in Milwaukee, people here are just now figuring out who Giannis is after 2 mvps and a championship and still struggling to pronounce his name. Nobody outside of Milwaukee and Phoenix cared about the finals this year despite Giannis and Chris Paul and booker playing and a pretty competitive series.   I don’t know the future of course but unless one of these guys create the next dynasty or win the next 2 or 3 mvps, they won’t touch the level of the top trio we have now in terms of popularity. I’m not saying the nba will die or anything, just saying it probably won’t be a lebron, Kobe, Jordan, Shaq, Kd, curry level guy that’s recognizable by non nba followers. If those guys dropped a shoe or released a movie nobody would buy or watch that shit, that’s just how it is."
"Who were probably the biggest unrestricted free agents this summer? You had guys like Kawhi, Conley, and Chris Paul who just re-signed with their teams (and that could happen with LaVine, of course). But what about guys like Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan? They were unrestricted but ended up getting signed and traded elsewhere. So the same could happen with big unrestricted free agents next summer as well, right?  So of course, the big question is ""why would the Bulls sign and trade LaVine next summer?"" Well first he'd have to make them believe he's going to leave no matter what. He could do that by threatening to go to Orlando, San Antonio or Detroit. That's probably how Kyle Lowry got Toronto to send him to Miami: by making them think if they didn't then he'd go sign with New Orleans and they'd get nothing in return. At least now they have Precious and Dragic, right?  So if LaVine wanted to go to say, the Lakers (this is Klutch, after all), all he'd have to do is convince the Bulls that they're going to lose him either way, and then they'll feel like they'd be better off getting something for him rather than nothing. So then all the Lakers would have to do to offer him a 4 year max at $154 million in a sign and trade is send back matching salary for that first year at $35.7 million. If only the Lakers had a big expiring contract they could send... Oh yeah, Westbrook will only have one year left on his contract next summer, they could send him! They also could send Chicago native Talen Horton-Tucker or their first round pick in 2027, 2028 or 2029 if needed.   So there you go. If you're a conspiracy theorist and you're wondering why LaVine might sign with Klutch, well it could be for the same reason Anthony Davis did. Or maybe he plans to just re-sign with the Bulls and wants Rich Paul to represent him. We'll have to wait and see."

This is what happens when you don’t win a ring. Adrian Dantley is up there too. Same thing gonna happen to Chris Paul in 20 years
I don’t understand why the Suns are so disrespected.   Ayton is already one of the best bigs in the league and young.   Chris Paul would’ve beat the super team warriors if he hadn’t gotten hurt and took RWB/Russ to 7.  Booker just dropped back to back 40s in the finals and no other young player in the league has iw many players at all.  Bridges has lot of potential on the offensive end and is a all defensive guy.  That team deserved to make the finals.
Fred Vanvleet/Kyle Lowry/Chris Paul
"&gt;Why yes I can. I spent 10 years thinking about exactly that. Think Chris Paul and Joe Johnson and Josh Smith would have been any good?  IIRC, Joe Johnson didn’t play for the Hawks until 2005-06? I’m not sure if that trade for Diaw happens, but there was probably limited sign and trade offers available.  The Hawks probably suffer for another 1-2 years and respectively are able to move up in at least the 2006 NBA Draft.  They probably end up with CP3, Smith and LaMarcus Aldridge."
Why yes I can. I spent 10 years thinking about exactly that. Think Chris Paul and Joe Johnson and Josh Smith would have been any good?   Instead we got years of Speedy Clayton and the dried up corpse of Mike Bibby. I don’t generally believe you should worry about drafting for for current fit too much at #2 but goddamn that pick was a disaster for the Hawks.
"But that's exactly what they are, because that same excuse doesn't always fly depending on the player being discussed. Harden was a ""choker"" because he couldn't beat a better team. I see a laundry list of reasons in this thread to defend why Lillard loses and many are reasonable, but if this was a chris paul thread 3 years ago, or a paul george thread or an any player that gets memed thread it'd be all about choking and no competitive spirit and all sorts of stuff. There's no consistency in this sub about who is allowed the excuses and who is not when situations can be pretty similar."
Give me one good reason why Chris Paul should be ranked above Trae
"The OP purposely left out large parts of the article. Other important information  &gt; That accept-the-qualifying-offer, bet-on-yourself tactic—in addition to client-poaching from other agents—has drawn ire from Paul's rivals in the agency world. To be fair, they are often guilty of the same activities; a significant portion of income for larger agencies is generated by poaching clients before a player's next lucrative deal.  &gt;The National Basketball Players Association does not prohibit certified agents from contacting other certified agents' clients, a noted contrast to the NBA's tampering rules, prohibiting team executives from contacting rival teams' talent. That stance has frustrated many agents for years.  &gt;And it's not just Paul.  &gt;Sources told Bleacher Report that Victor Oladipo was influenced to leave longtime representative Aaron Turner of Versus Management for Excel Sports just before free agency this summer. Excel gave Oladipo the same sales pitch: a new agent can deliver more money than the previous one. In this case, like Noel's, they didn't deliver.  &gt;Back in 2017, Robert Covington left his agent Chris Patrick (who helped land the two-way forward his first legitimate NBA stop in Philadelphia) for behemoth CAA Sports ahead of signing a four-year, $62 million deal.  &gt;Oladipo and Covington are merely two of a long list of examples.  &gt;The union has never shown much interest in policing such backchanneling. But a popular solution often mentioned by agents is saving 1 percent of the commission on a player's next contract for the previous representative, which would likely require some form of arbitration.  &gt;""It is wild to see all of it aired out like this,"" another veteran agent said. ""It happens all the time, but it never becomes public. It happens around the draft even. Guys will say anything to convince these players to come.""  &gt;Maybe these headlines do go away and Noel's filing was simply a public gesture against the agent he feels wronged him. ""I'll pay you this 200 grand, but I'm gonna s--t in your cornflakes before I do,"" one representative who previously worked with Noel said.  &gt;The majority of league sources contacted by B/R do expect the union to settle some type of agreement between these two parties, being that a legitimate legal battle benefits neither Klutch nor Noel. For Noel to win $58 million in alleged lost salary, he would seemingly face a daunting uphill battle in a court of law.  &gt;""The truth is Nerlens is not innocent in this,"" another agent said. ""If you're silly enough to turn down that kind of money, that's not on Rich.""  &gt;Paul's defense would be simple: An agent can never be held accountable for accurately predicting the future. He was providing a client with counsel, counsel that Noel did not have to accept, and if Noel did not suffer an injury, he very well could have garnered a richer deal.  &gt;That following summer, in 2018, Clint Capela scored a five-year, $90 million contract from the Rockets, a solid payday for a bouncy pick-and-roll threat and rim-protector of similar ilk.  &gt;Noel's case relies on the argument that Paul did not act in Noel's best interest, that Paul had no part in pitching the center to the Thunder in 2018 or sufficiently marketing him to other teams the following seasons.  &gt;It likely would be very challenging, however, for Noel's defense to find a team figure willing to come forward and confirm that series of events as a witness at trial. It's a sensitive topic that multiple league personnel declined to comment on for this article."
"If Rich Paul really did steal Noel away from his agent and then toss him aside like hot garbage, then I think we really need to rethink exactly what kind of ""player empowerment"" movement Paul is a part of. Is it power for Lebron James, Chris Paul, and a handful of other superstar players? Or is it power for every player up and down the roster? For every star player who exercises their own power to demand a trade to another team, there are several players who get traded against their will, or at the very least without their input, to make that trade happen.  I can appreciate that Rich Paul is helping players exercise more control over where they play, who they play with, and what direction the team takes. I'm very much in favor of players having more say in how the league operates. But just because SOME players are exercising power doesn't mean that's a general good for all players. How Rich Paul treats a guy like Noel to me is an important bellweather for that assessment."
"The Hawks' point guard dilemma was never resolved, which is kind of hilarious.  Could you imagine Chris Paul throwing lobs to Josh Smith?"
"We've heard many stories about Chris Paul being hard or difficult on teammates. Question is, who keeps him in check? When he was injured during the Finals, there was a stretch of two games where he didn't play well. Probably should have been benched. On the Clippers, he's beefing with Blake. Their team culture was horrible. On the Rockets, Harden and Paul couldn't make things work. Maybe he should take a long look at himself, while amazingly talented, his leadership skills and self awareness is lacking."
T.J. McConnell  Kyle Lowry  Chris Paul
"Al Horford. Never really looks spectacular in the box score, but when you see all the little things he does on court (clever screens and boxing out, and quick passes), you see how good a player he is/was. He's a bit like a front court Chris Paul, in that he makes everyone around him look better."
"Cavs trade 2018 LeBron and Kevin Love  for Suns' Devin Booker, Chris Paul, and FRPs."

Chris Paul is Iniesta  Paul George is Griezmann (this one because of level of talent/public perception)  Popovich is Sir Alex Ferguson  Boogie is Balotelli  Messi is like if Curry was great enough to be the GOAT  Lillard is Hazard just because Hazard is to Messi what Lillard is to Curry.  Ramos is Draymond

"&gt; Are we 100% confident they beat the Cavs, though?  That's what I've been saying. The Rockets were a much better team, but Chris Paul and Harden tend to average a couple chokes in the playoffs. One squandered opportunity could easily lead to momentum shifting with the way Lebron was playing then."
Chris Paul
"The funny thing too is the last 2 seasons has proven Chris Paul has a lethal, hyper efficient mid-range shot that he can get just about whenever he wants. A couple of those substituted in for some of their other shots could have stopped the bleeding and made all the difference. But no, Morey ball."
"He got dwight after a full season and then he started missing games and declining because of injuries and was only an allstar for 1 year. Then harden didn’t get Chris Paul until 2018, and even he was missing games (title winning games at that) when it mattered, then he got westbrook who was the worst player on the floor in the playoffs.  Curry has had 2 consistent allstars at his disposable since 2015 and had them *and* an MVP for 2016-2019"
"Ricky Rubio, Dennis Schroeder, Chris Paul"
"Uh, harden had the better series in 2019. While being on the far worse team   They won by 9 with shit refs and no Chris Paul. Bail out"
For Chris Paul that is healthy
My favorite point guard Chris Paul
"Yeah but they’re really the only example of on the court (or at least directly adjacent) scandals in the NBA.  The Lakers themselves weren’t the ones cheating.  And Chris Paul veto makes sense when you consider the league was acting at some level of ownership of New Orleans. As commissioner, irrespective of New Orleans mgmt, David Stern would’ve wanted the trade to go through. Moving a top 10 player from NO to LA is perfect for the bottom line of the league. Not really a conspiracy or scandal."
Chris “lost a playoff game by 58 points“ Paul definetly knows about losing.
2002 Kings v. Lakers? Cancelling the Chris Paul trade for basketball reasons?  Those are the worst I can think of.
"CP3 has been his nickname since childhood FYI. His father was Charles Paul (CP1), his brother Charles Edward Paul (CP2), and his Chris Paul (CP3)"
It’s a much more dramatic version of when Pau stayed on our team after the Chris Paul trade fell through
"You wanna know the truth? I don't think we're on the Chris Paul timeline, I just don't think the next few years are realistically ours, but a lot of the old guard is on their way out. If and its a big if, we can retain booker, Ayton develops and the role players stay good there's absolutely a chance they win one but things just have to fall their way, like it usually does for everyone.  I mean no one cares that the Lakers were absolutely ravaged when MJ won his first ring anymore, it was just the start of greatness.  If we can retain some success too we might attract the odd disgruntled free agent, Phoenix is a surprisingly large sports market. At the end of the day though the last time I watched the suns in the playoffs I wasn't even a teenager, I'm just stoked to watch good basketball with stakes."
"Somebody just said Carmelo lost to a lot of great teams in the playoffs and then people were able to come up with two non-historic teams he lost to out of his like 15 career playoff series where he has played Kobe, Lebron, Celtics big 3, Dirk, Chris Paul, etc. “Revisionist history garbage” is a bit much"
"He wasn’t a threat to actually beat good teams in OKC. Low seeded small market playoff teams are the sweet spot for getting love, you’re not bad enough to get mocked for sucking but you’re not gonna actually beat any good teams either.  Also ESPN had a big Chris Paul love-in through the whole playoffs and there’s a huge number of people who react badly to literally anything ESPN pushes whether it’s reasonable or not (see also: Trae Young, Lonzo Ball)."
Chris ‘Chase the Dragon’ Paul. Sad to see crippling addiction at the end of someone’s prime
Chris Paul is unironically the type of guy to pull out the rule book in the middle of a board game when he starts losing
We just beat them 4-0 with an injured Chris Paul and not any of the games were close. Not saying that Denver isn't gonna present a challenge and even possibly win but I'd put money on us being the favorites in that series.
"It's pretty close, actually. The Suns and Bucks are getting roughly the same off-season that Denver and Boston got last year, and we saw what it did to those teams. The guys to really keep an eye on are the three who played in the Olympics this year, of course, but also 36 year old Chris Paul (who has only had long off-seasons before now), and Jae Crowder who also had a short off-season last year being a member of Miami's bubble team."
"Yes, because this sub loves Chris Paul"
"If Rondo goes to the Lakers, the only active starter from the 2013 All Star game to not be on the Lakers/Nets is Chris Paul.  &amp;#x200B;  |EAST|WEST| |:-|:-| |Rajon Rondo - Lakers|**Chris Paul - Suns**| |Dwyane Wade - Retired|Kobe Bryant - Retired :(| |LeBron James - Lakers|Kevin Durant - Nets| |Carmelo Anthony - Lakers|Blake Griffin - Nets| |Kevin Garnett - Retired|Dwight Howard - Lakers|"
"These takes are so bad because you act like the Suns were perfectly healthy.   Chris Paul was hurt in the first game against the Lakers and was very obviously off.   Chris Paul was also out the first 2 games against the Clippers, but you neglected to account for that as well.   Chris Paul then had hand surgery after the finals. Sounds like he was playing through injury then too, no?   And reports have come out that Booker was dealing with a hamstring injury in the finals.   I'm not using it as an excuse for losing the finals, but if you're going to count injuries, count them all."
"&gt; Ummm I said on pace for a 53 win season, that's the truth if you like it or not, I'm not extrapolating I'm just telling you a basic fucking fact based on the numbers we do have.   That’s literally what extrapolating is.  &gt; Yeah the subset isn't that large but how tf do you know the nuggets dominate? Just guessing? Looking at their talent on paper? I love how this sub had complete hypothetical premonition and if they're wrong for whatever reason it's because of some outside unatural force that made it not count. It's a sport, there's randomness to sports, but based on the information we do have the nuggets and the suns are close to each other, it's not the difference between say the 2nd seed and the 7th  Because they were only 4 games behind the Suns despite being decimated by injuries and the Suns being completely healthy. Including Chris fucking Paul only missing 2 games. Insane odds."
"And here I thought you weren’t a troll. Sigh.   Throwing stones from a glass house, buddy.  Chris Paul is your PG. I wouldn’t be too cocky if I were you."
https://c.tenor.com/F00W5rJTnokAAAAC/chris-paul-not-funny.gif
"they definitely would be a tough team to beat in 7, i just disagree with saying we would have to do a lot of growing to beat them... at worst it's a tossup. we're right there with them.  &gt;They had the best record in the NBA this year  over us, by literally one game. their regular season doesn't separate them from us at all.  &gt;dealt with two injured starters (one being their best player) in the playoffs.  and lost to a team that was missing their best player, that we beat while chris paul was also dealing with an injury. everyone was playing hurt to some degree in the playoffs."
mitchell playing hurt doesn't mean they should lose to the clippers. chris paul was playing hurt too.
But he actually *was* without an allstar. Chris Paul made the team in 2016 and didn’t make it again until 2020.
Simmons feels like a given. I can also see Chris Paul taking a step back( preparing for downvotes)
Like Chris Paul for the suns? Who do you suggest?
PG: Chris Paul ($3)  SG: Michael Jordan ($5)  SF: Tracy McGrady ($2)  PF: Draymond Green ($1)  C: Hakeem Olajuwon ($4)
"Both of them are point gods, but Chris Paul is THE Point God"
"Yeah no question, he was able to rebuild without tanking -- which even he admitted took luck in order to get the chance at trading for Harden. However there's a good chance the team wouldn't have been able to land Harden had the trade for Gasol gone through (the New Orleans/Lakers Chris Paul ""veto"" trade)."
Russell Westbrook is better than Chris Paul.
"Although injuries did play a part for them getting to the finals, Im sure no one expected them to stay at number 2 seed even with the addition of Chris Paul."
"I always found that the Spurs losses were more compelling than their wins. Other than Rasheed leaving Robert Horry open, their Championships weren't that memorable.  But almost all of their series losses are signature moments for the other team:  * 2000 Suns: high point of the Kidd era * 2001 Lakers: high point of the Shaq-Kobe era * 2004 Lakers: Fisher 0.4 shot * 2006 Mavs: Nowitzki 3-point play  * 2007 Suns: high point of the Nash era (Spurs won this series after suspensions) * 2011 Grizzlies: 1-8 upset * 2012 Thunder: 0-2 comeback, only Finals appearance * 2013 Heat: Allen shot * 2015 Clippers: signature Chris Paul shot in game 7, high point of Lob city * 2017 Warriors: The Zaza game"
"His teams had the #1 offense for nearly a decade.     Mavs 2002 - 1st     Mavs 2003 - 1st     Mavs 2004 - 1st     Suns 2005 - 1st     Suns 2006 - 1st     Suns 2007 - 1st      Suns 2008 - 2nd (by 0.1)     Suns 2009 - 1st     Suns 2010 - 1st        Even when MDA was no longer the head coach starting in 2008, the Suns were still #1 for the next two seasons with Alvin Gentry. You can't even say they kept running the same system because they had to accommodate Shaq. He ran the best offense in the league across three different coaches.      Here is MDA's coaching record (team offensive rating) after his time with the Suns...     Knicks 2009 - 17th     Knicks 2010 - 18th    Knicks 2011 - 5th     Knicks 2012 - 17th     Lakers 2013 - 8th    Lakers 2014 - 23rd     Rockets 2017 - 2nd     Rockets 2018 - 1st     Rockets 2019 - 2nd     Rockets 2020 - 6th      It took one of the best point guards of all-time in Chris Paul plus another all-time playmaker in Harden for MDA to regain the #1 offense in the league in 2018.  Nash did it as the sole playmaker.     That's not to mention, he averaged 17/7 on 48/43/90 splits during those last few years with the Mavs (59 TS%) and then 17/11 on 41/45/91 for most of his time with the Suns (63 TS%). He wasn't ""just"" a ""16/7"" player.      But sure, let's focus on his defense."
Yeah...  Much better guys. Like Lebron in 2010-11.  And Dirk in 2005-06.   And Chris Paul in 2007-08.  And Shaq in 2000-01.  So 2x Nash is greater than 1x KG? Please. KG is discussion top 20. Nash is not in that discussion and he is probably the only one with 2x MVP not considered for top 20.

"&gt; Chris Paul began his vegan diet in 2019  He went plant based starting June 2019.  That would put the start date AFTER his injury marred 2018-2019 season.  The 2019-2020 season was the first season he managed to stay healthy in a long time.  &gt;“I chose a plant-based life. So far, so good. Not easy. But for me it’s working. I started plant-based in June. ""  https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a30500407/chris-paul-diet-vegetarian/"
Rose had Luol Deng! Harden only had Chris Paul!!  Hahaha do you hear yourself?
50-8 with Chris Paul 15-9 without him
Chris Paul began his vegan diet in 2019 which was one of the worst years of his career and he was injured throughout that year. Who knows how he's supplemented since then.
Chris paul is a future hall of famer  32 mpg is alot of playing time
???  Chris Paul went vegan and is the healthiest of his career. You clearly have some nonsense agenda to push
"Context was provided though. Chris Paul missed time and didn’t make any teams. And even when he did play, he was on a 32 MPG restriction"
Rose was close to that without anyone near chris paul to help him
"I think the only factor that's missing is whether there was a better pick in the draft. It's hard to say Kenyon Martin is a bust because who was better in that draft? You could probably make a case that Andrew Bogut was more of a bust when you could have picked someone like Chris Paul that year.  Also, fwiw, although they're both busts, I feel very differently about like Greg Oden and Anthony Bennett. Oden was an *unlucky* pick. If he didn't have the injuries I believe he would have been a perennial all-star. It was a good pick with an unlucky break. Bennett was a bad pick. A scouting error."
"This always reads as faint praise to me. Being the ""guy who makes the offense gel"" is not that great of a compliment when your team is mediocre offensively.  Like I don't think its a coincidence you still talk about KD like he is on the team.  Dubs fans also treat him with baby gloves when it comes to criticism.  I get all the things he does well and how awesome it is to have a 4 that can run point at a high level, but if you had a Chris Paul level awesome point guard who averaged 5 ppg and couldn't shoot that would be a pretty bigflaw in your it team regardless soft how well he played defensively."
LeBron is one of the biggest. He's nowhere near Harden but he's definitely one of the biggest. So is Chris Paul. And Marcus Smart. They don't all share the number one spot. But they're the ones I think about when I think 'flopping'.
"ill never forget her question to chris paul after the finals. ""how are you feeling?""..  &amp;#x200B;  thats the best you can come up with?"
"Chris Paul is an advanced stats god. 11th all-time in winshares, 9th all-time PER, 5th all-time BPM"
Yeah in that era it was pretty common for multiple guys to be pushing 3 steals a game. Some years now no one reaches 2. And Chris Paul is the highest in like the last 15 years at 2.5 steals per game. There is zero shot anyone will get close to 3 in the next decade unless they change and enforce carrying rules. And that basically makes it impossible because whilst steals are more valuable than blocks centres can generally get a relatively similar amount to guards just by blocking the lay down or reading cuts. Which basically makes it impossible for a guard to get close to a centre.
"'Russell Westbrook is better than Chris Paul"""
"Wow those compilations are eye opening. I wonder if/when kyle Lowry will get his heel turn in this sub, he’s like a poor mans chris Paul. Yeah he’s good, but he’s a dirty flopping bastard"
"He'll be remembered for lob city, but his best years were in New Orleans. Chris Paul led the league in win shares in 2008 and led the league in defensive bpm in 2009."
"Overrated, bad contract on the back end. Way too old, “leadership” isn’t as valuable as youth and skill once you get super fuckin’ old and Chris Paul &gt; Lowry so the comparison isn’t that meaningful.   Miami probably fucks the whole East up anyways to spite me."
chris paul is on par surely?
"Even if Ja takes a leap he won't be on Traes level.  Chris paul doesn't play enough minutes.  There might be someone else (Luka, Jokic?) but I'd honestly say Trae is the favourite at this point."
"""Steph curry just shoots 3s"" or ""Chris Paul isn't a bitch""."
"I think you kind of miss the point there.  Jimmy seems to first of all to criticize WB of his lack of jump shooting ability. Westbrook that was 35-38% 3pt shooter would have fit much better to basically every single good team that he has played in (that's the nature of shooting, it's scalable skill) and would likely had much more success in playoffs and quite likely on individual front as well.  As secondary thing it's the fact that while lacking that ability he's playing like he is a good shooter for majority of the time. Now you seem to make assertion there that it's either a jump shot or a pass that he has to do, which I don't think is the case.  From his time on strong teams and passing. It's not that he should have recorded more assists or anything like that, but more often than not he was taking larger role than necessary on those teams. It's more understandable when he plays with a weak team and has crazy his usage rate and takes tons of shot attempts, but the issue is that he hasn't adjusted that enough so far when he has played with players like Kevin Durant or James Harden etc.  However passing as I mentioned is not the only option. In many situations he could drive, but opts to taking a open jump shot instead. Now this might be good quality offense for Chris Paul for example, but rarely it has been so in Westbrook's case and especially in his younger days driving whenever that was available, even if there was open jump shot as well, was almost always the better choice as it allows him to either take higher quality shot around the rim with potential of drawing a foul or collapse the defense and use his passing to find the open man."
Chris Paul
Chris Paul is better than Booker and Mitchell
“Chris Paul is better than Russell Westbrook right now”
"The people who said that are as ""doofus"" (cmon is this elementary school? 😂) as you and had no stats to prove it, shush boy.   Takes a few second to read my post and see my lineup of Bron West Kobe Kareem and Shaq. I lost faith in the average fan the way you said they were weak at forward, LeBron is gonna command the main unit and West is knocking down shots, Kobe is knocking down shots, then you have Baylor and Worthy to sub in then it's not hard to understand.  If I wanted LeBron to play off-ball, Magic would be a shit point guard to pair with him, I'd just use Chris Paul or Curry, in the Lakers' case, LeBron is able to thrive at point guard and take a lower scoring load.  So yea, this works, youre too lazy to research why, you're close minded and let me remind you that two top 5 guards, 2020 lebron facilitating, unstoppable SHAQ (not stopping him from going to the rim) and KAREEM is great and that Kobe is fine at the small forward spot, he can rotate to shooting guard if need be.  You've blatantly shown me that you have no good takes and that you can't even think for yourself, resorting to picking from people with less knowledge than u think."
"Plus the arguments themselves were so stupid and contrived. ""Is this year's championship a win for Giannis, or a loss for Chris Paul?"" Like what a stupid question to be debating"
Pelicans:  Chris Paul  Jrue Holiday   Trevor Ariza  Anthony Davis  Demarcus Cousins
"Only competition is Chris Paul and maybe Ja is he takes a leap, but I still trust Trae over both of them to average 10+ per game"
I met Chris Paul and he’s the same height as me at 5’11.
"Agreed. On the street Chris Paul is tall.   Not towering over people, but he'd never be the smallest in a room."

Incoming embiid and chris paul comments/clips
"I'd take anything that involves traditional stats with a huge grain of salt when it comes to evaluating defensive ability. Case in point, [Paul Pierce and Dirk Nowitzki have more defensive win shares than Dennis Rodman, Chris Paul, Gary Payton, etc.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/dws_career.html)"
"Yup. Hell, we thought Dennis Schroder was going to be good because of one good season playing with Chris Paul. Then he just reverted to the mean."
"Seriously, dude won his only title in 26 games, and anyone could’ve coached that Boston team to a title. Dude went to 7 games against a Hawks team that 1, had no business being in the playoffs, 2, had a worse record than the 11th in the West Kings, and 3, only beat out 9th in the East Pacers by a game.   I get on him a lot because he is always called a great coach by the media.  He was great with those non-stars Clippers, but when he has had stars, he has done nothing since Boston. And I am not excusing the Chris Paul injury in 2015 or Blake Griffin injury in 2017. The only one I give him a pass for was 2016."
"Hinkie's failure were due to philosophy as well.  1. He grossly overrated the impact of centers in the modern NBA and had a fixation with forcing opponents to double team the post - This is the antithesis of modern pace-and-space basketball.   2. He overvalued BPA with little to no regard for how logjams could:   a) disrupt the team and the development of young players    b) tank the market value of the players you're acquiring - This, in turn, would tank their ability to probably reshape the team later on by trading misfitting players  3. He grossly undervalued the infrastructure required to win. In throwing everything away to tank he lost key vets and coaching staff who would normally have guided and helped developed the young core he was bringing in.    It's the reason why tanking teams have been going so overboard on chasing experience after seeing Philadelphia's struggles over the past 2-3 years. It's why guys like Chris Paul are so valuable to lottery teams now.  If you celebrate losing for 4-5 years you're not going to have anyone left who understands how to win.    Hinkie went all-in on finding talent and left no infrastructure in place to cultivate the talent he'd found.    &gt;But Colangelo's mistake was one of philosophy. He went all in for one year, giving up future assets and flexibility. That is the antithesis of the Process.   Actually no...The quick pivot was part of Hinkie's plan all along.   In his own words:  * *""Salary cap position*   *Our salary cap position going forward is easily the NBA's best. The most room, the most flexibility, providing the widest available set of options in free agency or trade of any club.* ***This stockpile can be used all at once*** *or strategically over the ensuing years to acquire players that fit your team, improve in your development program, and help you move up the standings.""*    https://www.espn.com/pdf/2016/0406/nba_hinkie_redact.pdf   The Process wasn't just to tank. It was an attempt to dumb down talent evaluation to a points-based system. ""We need x number of talent points on our roster to contend, how can we get x number of talent points?""  The main answer to that question was to tank and bring in cheap blue-chip prospects and then because they're on incredibly cheap rookie-scale contracts you now have the cap space to focus on bringing in established star players.   ***  So much of Philly's history gets re-written to make Hinkie look better than he was. Basically, anything that was good gets attributed to Hinkie and anything that was bad gets attributed to Colangelo/Brand.   Everyone credited Hinkie for the 76ers getting a FA interview with LeBron beforehand. Then it came out LeBron didn't even meet with them and suddenly it was all Colangelo's hair-brained scheme.  Everyone gave Hinkie credit when the 76ers put their chips in to acquire star players to work alongside Embiid/Simmons. Now it's ""Hinkie would never"".  Brett Brown is seen as a key failure of the Colangelo era, despite being a Hinkie hire."
Did you read what I said? I said if Lowry makes a huge difference along with the addition of PJ Tucker and maybe return to form for Dipo and Herro. They were a year away from the Finals so it’s not like they need some crazy turnaround. Chris Paul helped turn the Suns into a Finals team. Quit being dense dude. I said guaranteeing the Nets will win if healthy is dumb as we have seen crazier things.
Chris Paul was definitely injured in the lakers series too
And he's sure af not the one who forced Chris Paul out of Houston...
Wasn’t Chris Paul also injured?
I think it was the season after the KD/Dray thing Brandon Ingram and Rondo swung on Chris Paul
"I mean all we're really saying is Harden is better at making free throws and 3s. I fully agree. But that's all it is. More points per game due to various factors. Percentages have been going up since hand checking (04 or 05?), and league focus on efficiency.   You also have to factor in who these players played with. Even comparing against league average. We can't isolate Harden playing with Chris Paul or Dwight Howard against Tmac with Mike Miller or Grant Hills missing ankle."
"The 90s didn't have a superteam, the 91-93 Bulls was 2-star team with good roleplayers and the 96-98 Bulls was an incredibly old team for NBA standards also with two stars, Rodman was incredible, but he also was 34 years old, consistently missed games and by 1998 he wasn't even a starter anymore. The closest thing the 90s got to a superteam was the 1997 and 1998 Rockets with Hakeem, Drexler and Barkley, but it obviously didn't work out, as the Jazz beat them in back to back years.  You are also out of your damn mind if you think that Stockton and Malone wouldn't be a playoff team today, they won 64 games in 1997 in a stacked West, they were incredibly efficient on offense for the time they played in and were a top 10 defensive squad.  Karl Malone would be at worst a Top 5 player in the league today and John Stockton was putting up better numbers than Chris Paul did in 2021, but in a much slower pace."
That’s just Chris Paul punching that guy from the State Farm commercials
"My man, there were five seasons between the Lakers making the playoffs and Lebron joining. They had a stretch of 3(!) seasons without an all time great, going from Kobe to Lebron and eventually AD and now Westbrook.  Some of the notable guys who have played for the Lakers include:  Shaq  Kobe   Magic  Kareem  Wilt  Lebron  AD  Westbrook   Jerry West  Elgin Baylor  George Mikan  James Worthy  Michael Cooper  Byron Scott  Vets like Gary Payton, Karl Malone, Dwight Howard, Steve Nash,   Plus guys who reportedly wanted to play there like Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Chris Paul, etc.  I really don't think it's a stretch to say that they've been a blessed franchise. They have 17 championships, tied for the most. They had a handful of bad years because Kobe was at the end of his career and they were doing right by him. Then they botched their rebuild to an extent, until Lebron fell in their lap and they were able to get Anthony Davis for a bunch of guys who mostly don't even play for the Pelicans anymore."
"Shooting and running a half court offense is what a PG is supposed to do  I get his unique skillet, his transition play, his defensive versatility, all of that is awesome  But a PG is supposed to shoot and run a half court offense, and the fact that he can't is an issue  Stealing from elsewhere:   It would be like if Chris Paul was our center. ""Oh, he can get steals, and playmaker and lock down guards- look at all these things he can do that most centers couldn't! So what if he can't protect the paint, he doesn't have to!""  It's just dumb.  Simmons is great for a hundred reasons, but if we cant run a half court offense through him, we're handicapped."
"literally almost derailed russ’s career, hurt the OKC championship hopes among other things. the chris paul push is pretty inexcusable too. a lot of these are defense, or even dirty. it’s just being a straight up cunt"
"I can agree a lot of what you said.   Dwight actually is a pretty good guess for this considering he's in the same mold as Willis, but an even better player. Chris Paul was never an athletic player, so his shooting touch and high BBiQ would carry him far.  My main question for both of them is health. Dwight had a bad back almost a decade ago, and that could be a major issue the older he gets. CP3 is \~always\~ hurt, so it seems unlikely he'd go the distance to 44 years of age (seven years from now).  BTW, another player to look at as an example is Kareem. He didn't make it to 44, but retiring at 42 ain't too shabby either. The sky hook kept him relevant for so long, and along with Willis and Haslem it may point to the fact that you have to be a ""big"" to even get a chance to keep playing for that amount of time."
How about a Russell Chris Paul hybrid then
"I think they need to have a few qualities right now to make it that far;  * Currently 30+ and playing at a decent-good level (a younger player can but it becomes a pure gamble in guessing) * Comfortable playing a reduced and/or locker room roll * Loves the game deeply and wants to keep playing **or** loves the paycheck deeply and wants to keep playing  My first instinct was KD and/or LeBron but I'm not sure I see a world where either is comfortable coming off the bench or playing 10-15 minutes a game, or starting on a very bad team - I don't care if you're LeBron, I don't believe a 44 year old player is going to be a good starter on a good team playing high minutes.  In all I think Dwight Howard is the most likely. He's just about 36 and said earlier in the year he wants to play five more years. He clearly wants to win rings, and it feels like he's accepted small(er) roles. Still playing at a good level. Chris Paul is another one, though it remains to be seen if he's comfortable taking a bench role which I think is the biggest obstacle for most players staving off retirement."
"chris paul def more of a 190 guy, provided he is anywhere close to his listed 6'0"" (which he probably isn't)"
Chris Paul and Marcus Morris would be on it
"LOL Okay..... Harden, without Chris Paul and his starting PF is supposed to beat arguably the best team to ever play.... he also cannot make his teammates hit open shots when he is doubled and tripled and kicks to open players.... then again his best teammate in game 6-7 was Eric Gordon, who is really best suited as a 6th man."
"It’s actually a joke. If you can believe it I’ve never played with Chris Paul , rondo, or lowry"
"**1) Why would David Stern have it in for the Lakers?**  This is a guy who said his ideal matchup would be “the Lakers vs. the Lakers” because of the franchise's star power and global appeal. It doesn’t make financial sense that he would dislike the Lakers.   It wouldn’t destroy the league at all. You can’t tell me that the league wouldn’t want to see Kobe/CP3/Dwight in LA vs LeBron/Wade/Bosh in Miami.   **2) Dan Gilbert and some other small market owners really didn’t want all the star power to be in big markets.**   This little group was the reason that the NBA who owned the Hornets at the time vetoed the deal.    **3) Jeanie Buss herself said that the problem stemmed from Dell Demps, the Hornets GM, basically overstepping his authority when the league collectively owned the team.**  &gt; And so as we’re in this room, all of a sudden, there’s kind of this rumor that goes in around the room about a trade. Well, at that time, the team was run by the league, right? So there’s no way a trade can be happening if we’re all in this room doing league business. Except the [New Orleans] general manager of the team felt that he had the authority to make a trade. … So the trade was happening while everybody is in this room, so teams felt like ‘How is that possible? We didn’t get a chance to make a trade for Chris Paul?’ And so they all attacked the league and said this wasn’t fair.”"
"7 feet 190 lbs, good gravy. I'm 5'11"" and when I was lifting weights a lot more and also got a little chubby, I was flirting with 190.  nba.com has Fred VanVleet at 197 pounds, Kyle Lowry at 196, Chris Paul at 175.  Strap this boy into the force feeding apparatus."
Chris Paul?
Ben Simmons for Chris Paul and Cam Johnson. Who says no.
He poured flour onto his counter and started rolling it with a rolling pin. It was all a show lol   You’re absolutely right about the game thing though. Dude has a ton of confidence but to say little shit doesn’t get under his skin is laughable. Why you think he pushed Chris Paul that game? Cause CP3 got under his skin a bit
"More related to the most skilled question - but the most skilled offensive players of all-time are definitely the shorter guards and point guards. I think guys like Chris Paul, Tony Parker, Steve Nash and Steph Curry are the most skilled of all-time. Give any of those guys the height and athleticism of someone like LeBron, KD or MJ and they’d be the GOAT easily."

Well chris paul can suck flaccid cock
Plenty of people thought dwight or Lebron deserved it at the time. I know this wasn't the narrative but chris paul had better advanced stats too.
Chris Paul jealous of 'the small guy getting glory' in reference to someone larger than him... what an amazing post
"Word. People prob have more “conventional” explanations. But I vibe this.   Jealousy is a bitch. The privy, spoiled rich kid,  light skin boy with no athleticism or physical tools came in and changed the game and ripped the rug from under a handful of guys.   Lebron would be the GOAT by now if there’s no Curry and Chris Paul would probably have a very legit argument for at least one as well.   Respect to Curry, even as a non-fan. The guy has come in and got it done."
"Absolutely - his mid-range game is GOAT status. It adds to the sheer audacity of his accomplishments that he wasn't a volume 3 point shooter and he did most of his damage in the mid-range. Guys like Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Kawhi Leonard etc. are keeping this lost art alive."
"They don't though I don't see Steph in any of the state farm commercials  /s (there u go, whatever it is)  But honestly, if Steph played like Kyrie, ISO ball midrange, he'd be loved. But he plays like a white guy. Off ball movement, 3 point shooting. Even off court, no drama, no locker room toxicity. He is so lovable and perfect. Coaches player. He is literally an NBA player's son.  Now look at Lebron, who's dad is a mystery, just some kid from Akron Ohio right?  Steph Curry is just some kid from Akron Ohio.  &amp;#x200B;  But furthermore, ya. Those guys don't like him. Remember when Chris Paul forced Curry out of the Toyota center cus he didn't want to let Curry get pre-game shots? That is petty as fuck. CP3 is like that tho. He hates Curry, probably hates Scott Foster more tho.  Westbrook goes like ""Steph? Who is he?, Hasn't done anything I haven't seen before"" THOSE ARE THE WORDS OF A HATER CUS ITS SUCH AN INFACTUAL OPINION."
"Lebron hates Curry lol even tho they say nice shit on the social medias. Curry stole his spotlight and his rings. You can see the videos. Lebron on the Heat saw Curry as an entertaining player, not a threat. Curry really fucked up Lebrons history by taking 3 rings away from him.   Chris Paul too. It was supposed to be him. But Curry took it all. These superstars were literally jealous cus this light skinned small guy is getting all the glory.   Westbrook also! I think it's cus they feel Curry isn't as black or something. I played varsity sports, people hate when you start over them. The parents get into it too. Why do you think rich kids are the way that they are. They taught that winning is everything and they have the money to get private coaches and be better at sports. So when you come around and take their crown, you destroy their world, and they hate you. This is what Steph did to every NBA superstar.   It seems childish but it is true. These superstars have incredibly low emotional IQ."
To be fair you can do that with a lot of point guards lol  Like for example 6'10 Chris Paul would be way better than 6'1 LeBron
Yea Chris Paul got hurt  But that’s the thing with him. He  always gets hurt. He was even playing hurt in round 1 vs spurs
"Chris Paul led the Rockets through a secret tunnel in the locker room to fight the Clippers, LAPD was called  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-twitter-cracks-up-at-chris-paul-leading-rockets-to-clippers-through-secret-passage/"
"&gt; I felt that Kidd's height would allow him to guard opposing small forwards?  That seems reasonable - even even late in his career after his quickness was too far gone to guard dudes like Chris Paul or Tony Parker, he still defended Kobe and LeBron well in the playoffs."
Rondo gives AD milk and cookies before bed. He uses softening agents for AD's brow. These are similar methods used by Chris Paul for Harden in the past. This is why Rondo was signed.
Is it too much to ask for him and Chris Paul on the same team?
Chris Paul catching strays
Fuck Chris Paul. GMs shouldn’t pay him or any agent any mind when players actively sabotage their teams like Harden did last year
"It's also what happened to Morey himself with the Chris Paul/Russell Westbrook trade. Morey tried to wait it out, insist Chris Paul and James Harden could coexist, then Fertitta came down and said ""get CP3 the fuck out of here."" Now Morey, Harden, CP3, and Russ are all on different teams. Life comes at you fast."
With CP3 they prolly could have dropped several other players and gotten a nice replacement for Wade.    Beyond that?  I think part of the issue stems from Miami arguably shouldn't have won in 2006 regardless at all but were gifted games 5/6 leading to a chip...  Give Chris Paul 23 free throws a game he's got a ring or two.
Chris Paul  Paul George  Patrick Williams  Anthony Davis  Moses Brown (can't think of a center)
It's wild that Chris Paul is one of the oldest dudes in the league yet helped lead the Suns to the Finals.
Chris Paul?
Same. I thought it was &gt;!Chris Paul!&lt; for sure. The fact that it’s a per game stat makes it make sense though

1. LeBron 2. Kobe 3. Duncan 4. Shaq 5. KG 6. KD 7. Curry 8. Wade 9. Dirk 10. Chris Paul
LeBron Shaq Tim KG Kobe Curry KD Chris Paul Wade and Dirk
"You should probably put Chris Paul and Anthony Davis on team 1, and put Shai and Bam on team 2"
Every active starter in the 2013 All Star game is currently a member of the Lakers/Nets except Chris Paul. KD and Blake are on the Nets and Dwight is a Laker.
Lebron James Kobe Bryant Tim Duncan  Steph Curry Shaq  Kevin Durant Dirk Nowitzki Kevin Garnett Chris Paul Dwayne Wade  The order was very tough. Tim Duncan would likely be 2 but hard to cut out 1997-2000 3 years of his prime and 1 title/fmvp and have him over Kobe  Shaq was only dominant for 5 years but he was so good in that span I got him over alot of players with awesome longevity
"I've always been a Booker fan, these playoffs did nothing but confirm that he can be the best player on a championship contender (I see him as better than CP3 because first   * think of the team without Chris Paul (just inside the playoffs because they were 9th last year and got major upgrade in coaching) * think of the team without Devin Booker (basically no scoring, I respect Paul and Ayton but they aren't primary scorers on a playoff team)  So I've always seen Booker as the best guy on this team and I know that's a hot take because everyone says it was all Chris Paul but people are forgetting about the bubble??? I think the drastic increase in wins was mainly due to DeAndre Ayton's improvement and Booker's maturity. Paul was a minor factor. Sure he was a good player but Booker is better. Draymond could be considered the leader of the Warriors, the glue guy, and is obviously not the best player. Although he is a completely different Chris has a similar role in terms of leadership. Go ahead and put me on some delusional takes thread if you want."
"He’s just missing *elite* handles (on par with say a Chris Paul, Kyrie or Iverson)   …but when you’ve maxed out basically every other attribute category, that probably doesn’t matter at all."
"Yes, I would use this all as argument about why the Nugs should be higher. Also, and I mean this as no offense to the Nugs fans, people think of Murray really highly because of his 2020 postseason, but he didn’t play to that level in the 2021 regular season and he is regularly about 15th in PER for his position over the past 4-5 seasons. He’s great, but he’s not Chris Paul or anything."
"I'm tired of of the Booker vs Mitchell debate. They're both about as good as a SG at their age can be expected to be. I will say though, it was Chris Paul that led that Suns team to the finals, not Book. Yes Book put up great numbers but it was CP3s leadership that led to that run."
The only active player from the 2013 all star game to advance to either 2021 conference finals was Chris Paul.
"Chris Paul played way better against us than any other series I saw him in.  We couldn't stop him.  PnR is definitely a problem same was cooking us too.  Unfortunately Jamal is our emotional leader.  Jokic looked pissed off at the end of the series I think it was just too much for him.  Having to be the whole offense and getting attacked most plays on defense was hard.  Honestly we were happy to beat Portland.  I would have liked to see more fight but it just wasn't our series.  Bad shooting by most players, lots of new players getting minutes.  We were running facu, Shaq Harrison and rivers extended minutes and none of them are really that good.  Gordan was shooting bad, we barely used mcgee, milsap was slowing down, green didn't shoot well.  I don't think it matters that much but I think had we been healthy we definitely make it a series.  Morris was coming back rom injury, same with Barton, and no dozier or Jamal.  That's four key players and I love the guys that stepped up and tried for us but it was just too much.  Jokic can still get pissed especially when he is getting mugged and Chris Paul is getting every call, but it's something Jokic has been better about.  So yeah that's what I think"
"dude no shit, it's impossible to know the value of anything. I said it's likely they'll get high pick(s), not a guarantee.  Look at the ""halls"" other players have fetched. All Houston got back for Harden was Oladipo and the Nets' picks (projected to be worse than Philly's if they got Dame). Look what AD went for, or PG or Jrue Holiday, etc. Basically every package is one young player with all-star potential, a couple young players as throw ins (maybe recent 1st rounders), and then as many picks &amp; swaps as teams' can offer.  It's also kind of funny you bring up Chris Paul because all it took to get him was Oubre, Rubio, and a first.  ***  &gt;Are you telling me I might have a good pick in 2028? Man that’s like no time in small market time. /s  I'd much rather be an OKC fan for the next 5-10 years than a Portland fan the next 5-10 years.  ***  Teams will be okay with paying Dame his 54M at the end of the contract as long as they get his most productive years up front. In 2-3 years, there will not be many teams eager to pay 34 year old Dame 50M/year. The first two years of that deal are what make him valuable, not the last 2.  Fact of the matter is, should Dame ask out and provide Portland with a shortlist of teams he wants to go to, their leverage will crumble and they'll succumb to his request. I apologize if that upsets you, but that's just how it works.  &gt;Boston is the only real answer for a trade that might even be palatable  How? What do they have to offer that's more valuable than Philly? I don't think they're willing to give up Brown in a deal for Dame.  &gt;Then I would still have more interest in Ingram than anything Philadelphia is making available.  Unless you take over Neil Oshey's job, this doesn't really matter. We have no idea who they matter, but it's moot if NOLA isn't on Dame's list.  &gt;Then I would probably rather have Siakim or Sabonis over Philadelphia’s garbage pile.  Again moot, unless you think Dame is interested in Toronto or Indy.  ***  You clearly just really don't like Simmons, which is fine. But you're letting that cloud your value far too severely. He's a 3 time all star and one of the best defensive perimeter players in the league. That's more than Sabonis, Siakam, Ingram, etc. We'll see if he can repair his image. But sometimes guys just have bad playoffs - like Dame in 2018 against the Pels.  ***  &gt;I’ll keep the asset I have under a 4 year contract and is the consummate professional. Thank you very much.  If that's what Dame wants, then it's 100% happening. But if he requests a trade he's gone, it's as simple as that. And should he ask out, it's hard to envision him going anywhere besides Philly, Golden State, or New York."
"You make a lot of assertions with no basis. You say there is a high pick in there but that’s just conjecture on your part. If Simmons/maxey and thybulle are so valuable why aren’t other teams trying to get them. You know come to think of it Simmons isn’t taking calls from the franchise and has openly expressed not wanting to go to Portland. Man you are right, what was I thinking, there is so much value here? Are you telling me I might have a good pick in 2028? Man that’s like no time in small market time. /s  That’s not a “great” hall for a player that came into the league later in life and plays below the rim. Chris paul is 36, I’ll be fine paying Dame what ever he wants to the end of his contract just like every other team in the league would. Portland knows the contract they offered and dame knows the contract he took.   Boston is the only real answer for a trade that might even be palatable. Then probably not trading him because Portland would have 4 years of arguably the best point guard in the league. Then I would still have more interest in Ingram than anything Philadelphia is making available. Then I would probably rather have Siakim or Sabonis over Philadelphia’s garbage pile. We literally just condemned Simmons at the end of the season for single handedly losing the series for his team while dame was losing in spite of himself. I’ll keep the asset I have under a 4 year contract and is the consummate professional. Thank you very much."
Yeah because it was a 4 on 1. If Chris Paul plays we win
Its up to the Pelican to build a successful team for him. They lost Chris Paul and Ad. I really hope Zion can stay with the Pelicans.
"It’s a consensus ranking because most fans are casual and just see ooh he scored 50 in the finals with by far the most stacked roster when accounting for injuries in the playoffs against probably the weakest finals team in 20 years led by a 36 year old Chris Paul whose only defender big enough for Giannis was like 19 and looked terrified to be on the court.   It’s just regency bias, if KDs foot was one inch smaller everyone would be clowning Giannis, if devin booker went off for 50 people would be calling him better than harden. Even though that would change nothing about how good they are.   It’s been clear since harden got left off any all nba team in 2017, which if you look back is just laughable, when Westbrook won mvp over harden when harden was better at literally every aspect of basketball except he averaged 9 rebounds instead of 10 spoonfed rebounds a game. When Giannis won mvp over harden when harden was averaging 36 ppg on crazy efficiency (something we won’t see for a long time) and dragging a worse roster to a high seed in the west. That people are just biased against harden and will overlook all of Giannis’s flaws because he seems nice.   Harden has been better than Giannis for years and he’s better than him now, but Giannis makes videos at chic fil a, so he’s on par with KD(ludicrous). Even Giannis doesn’t believe he’s on par with KD."
"Well... I'm a Raptors fan and Pistons fan.   With regard to the Raptors, I'd have to say there haven't really been 'dark days.'  Nothing like what the Kings are going through of the Clippers have gone through, or even the Warriors.   At first, it was exciting just to get a team. We got the ROY our first year. We got some great and entertaining talent early on (McGrady, Camby, and Carter).  Had some playoff runs with Carter, he left in the worst way possible, but we picked up Chris Bosh shortly there after.   Had some more playoff appearances. Lost Bosh, and then started toward building what eventually led to a championship.   The Pistons are likely in their darkest days since the 70s.   We build a contender through the 80s, getting deeper and deeper in the playoffs each year before winning back-to-back.   Had a rebuild that started out well. First got to watch Rodman tear it up with rebounds, lost him in a trade, then drafted Allan Houston. Lost him but got Grant Hill, who was on his way to becoming the best all-around player in the league.   Lost him, but got Big Ben in return.   Got to watch amazing rebounding and defensive performances, and the pieces slowly came together. Tore up the league, beat the Lakers (AGAIN) to win a title back-to-back finals, then eventually traded Billups and everything went down hill.   And since then, it has been almost 15 years since we won a playoff series.   Sure... we've had some entertaining talent along the way. A year of Blake. Some nice rebounding seasons out of Drummond. A sweet old school post player in Monroe. But horrible signings that looked promising (even if questionable) that didn't pan out (Josh Smith) and a bad trade that was the result of mandates from new management (Jennings).   And the draft? We passed up on Klay for Brandon Knight? FUCK!!! I was pissed THAT NIGHT!! And have grown more pissed since, watching what Klay turned into.   We got Greg Monroe, who looked great, but we passed up on Hayward and Paul George in the process.   Then we got KCP over McCollum.   Stanley Johnson? Over Booker, Oubre, and Myles Turner? I mean... it was like shooting fish in a barrel that draft, and we still missed.   Got Luke Kennard ONE PICK before Donavan Mitchell and a few ahead of John Collins.   The team has just drafted SO poorly over the last 15 years."
"Eh, Chris Paul is in the same boat."
"Name a ""pass-first"" point guard, though. Outside of *arguably* Chris Paul, every great point guard in this league is as much a scorer as he is a playmaker— even the very best passing PGs, guys like Trae, Luka, Westbrook, they're all just as likely to look to score as they are to look to pass. The old type of ""pass-first"" PG, the Kevin Johnson, Deron Williams, Jason Kidd type of star guard who averages somewhere around 20/10, that's *dead.* They don't exist anymore."
Considering Chris Paul lead the Thunder to the 5th seed that year when we literally traded away our 2 superstars and got us one game away from making the 2nd round I don’t understand how Booker couldn’t even make the playoffs.
Chris Paul
"""Despite having Chris Paul on the team""? Chris Paul was the reason why Booker sacrificed his stats and touches in the first place. Booker scored more points on better efficiency last year than Mitchell's best year and he was only 23; the fact that his numbers went down this year, in his age 24 season, probably doesn't imply that he's gotten worse as a player, right? Clearly he sacrificed his numbers for a Finals berth, and it worked."
"I never stated this is the first time I'm hearing this; I've heard this before. However, it's usually in the context of super team formation, not conference balance, because he's never shifted conferences until 2019, so we have no precedent to establish that him shifting conferences changes which conference is dominant.   What power shift was caused by him moving to Miami? Cleveland falling out of contention? More superteam formations? Ok, but that doesn't directly affect which conference was better. Who moved out of the east to avoid lebron and form a superteam elsewhere? Jimmy Butler? The east had already been devoid of the primary top talent because of terrible management on the big market teams, like another commenter stated. The Celtics, bucks, and sixers all have organically formed during the lebron era and haven't gained more talent since lebron left the east. Just opened up an easier path to the finals for other eastern teams.  What power has shifted back east because of lebron? KD and harden, I suppose, but I it's hard to argue their move had anything to do with lebron. Kawhi came back from the east. Chris Paul stayed in the west. AD stayed in the west. Not a lot of shifting. The Celtics were actually better when lebron was still in the east.   Now, don't get me wrong. I think that lebron moving and making decisions DOES have an impact on the league as a whole and how it responds, the same way the warriors superteam impacted how players and teams responded. Any dominant power has influence like that. So I agree with you there. BUT I just don't think it's conference specific in this case, and there's no proof or even good evidence that the east is better yet. It's been 3 full years of lebron in the west, and he's only made it past the first round once (many factors to that, obviously). The west is still very good, and the east still has to prove themselves."
"Chris Paul averaged 9/4/8 on 44% TS, and yet y’all still lost both games 5 and 6 in the first quarter to Devin Booker skullfucking your defense, tough"
"The Suns were 6-2 in games in the playoffs in games Chris Paul either missed or was heavily limited by an injury. They just finished with the 2nd best record in the NBA, a trip to the finals, and 3/5ths of their starting lineup is under the age of 25.   Lol that’s pretty fucking absurd saying that’s luck and random variability and not skill, that’s not how those statistics work at all. If anything, is a more varied outcome not one that is more determined by dependent variables… such as skill…? Some basketball fans might even say winning close games is a good thing that requires skill!!!   Suns had a better net rating than the Nuggets (and like 27 other teams), who didn’t tank for 2 whole games. You’re using net rating to say the Suns will regress… despite being 3rd in net rating… and the team with a 0.1 better net rating lost their superstar for the season… but sure, I totally see how you managed to think that justifies a regression in any way lol"
Last year in Mitchell’s 4th season he averaged 26.7 ppg on 57% TS and Devin Booker averaged 25.6 ppg on 59% TS in his 6th season. This is with Devin Booker having Chris Paul on his team and Donovan Mitchell’s 2nd best scoring threat probably being Jordan Clarkson. I’m not like saying TS is the end all be all of efficiency or anything because my main argument is what Mitchell has accomplished as the sole number 1 option compared to what Booker has done before CP3
Oh man its my favourite point guard Chris Paul!!
I know I’m getting downvotes because of recency bias but in reality. Chris Paul was at times the best player on that team and would have very likely won finals MVP. I think Devin Booker is a great player. But Booker lacks length and the speed to blow by players. He isn’t the best shooter and it’s not like he plays above the rim. He is amazing at making tough shots but Mitchell has shown what he is capable of as his teams sole offensive threat and I don’t believe Booker can do what he has done. And I stand by that
"The Spurs have no repeat titles. Everytime they win the championship, they get embarrassed (usually by an LA team). They’ve lost as a 1st seed in the 1st round. That’s more fucking embarrassing than missing the playoffs entirely.   Lakers only crashed and burned because the league unjustly decided that Chris Paul was too much for the Lakers because it was “unfair.” Look at the people who complained and see where their loser franchises are at now"
"I’m not OP, but it is true. Spurs are the only team that has an abnormal amount of success. But just like every other franchise, that success was bound to end. They also got lucky the league decided to be a bitch and block Kobe from getting Chris Paul. Would’ve ended the Spurs 5th title run"
"It ruined it but gave us the chance of something new. Finally seeing Chris Paul in the finals, Devin Booker having playoff success, Giannis proving haters wrong, ~~Blazers getting out of the first round~~, Paul George and other role players stepping up.   I know it isn't the Starpower or bracket we expect but seeing something other than LeBron, Curry, and KD roll through the playoffs can still be refreshing and entertaining even if the process to get there wasn't what we wanted"

If they want to push for another finals run they might have to give up a young asset. I wouldn’t really view it as giving up on him as much as they have a limited window to try to win with Chris Paul and may not want to wait 2-3 years for Jalen Smith to develop.
They have needed a dude to run PnR with him for years. Drives me bat shit that they focused on wings instead of trading for Chris Paul or Jrue.

"&gt; I think Boston could have landed any one of those guys without totally gutting the team to do so. Considering how highly prized some of the Celtics picks were back then (specifically the Kings, Clippers and Grizzlies picks), they might have been able to land one of those guys without including either Brown or Tatum (maybe Smart and one or two of those picks).    There's no way that Boston was landing any of those guys without giving up a Jay.    &gt; Hell, they could have easily got Chris Paul if they'd wanted to.    At which point? They couldn't this season and there was a time when CPs contract was valued less than Kembas is right now, and even then Boston didn't have matching salaries.   &gt; Honestly, they'd be so much better off right now if they'd either traded Hayward for Turner or even just to Charlotte for Batum.   I think that we should wait to see what Boston does with the TPE before burying them for that"
“Chris paul is tryna assault me”
Well Clippers take an absurdly low amount of attempts in the paint so kind of hard to count them. They also had an all time choke job. Steph and Dame yes but also jazz with Mitchell and Gobert lakers and even suns with pick and roll king Chris Paul could really hurt them if their main gameplan is to attack jokic and the paint
"I've been watching the rockets since the mid 90s, though I don't see how that matters.  The team was always structured around harden, but that doesn't mean we had washed players.  Westbrook, Chris Paul, Dwight (not prime, but still was a double double machine then), prime Ariza, Gordon, Lou Williams, Patrick Beverly, Chandler parsons (who got max contracted right after his rockets stint), post NYC Jeremy Lin, Ryan Anderson when he could still move, capella, and plenty of other veteran depth signings along the way.  The players weren't trash. It just takes a ton to win, and the only year we had all the pieces was when cp3 was here."
"That was the role he was literally traded for.  Morey brought him in to fill that role.  That's why Harden asked for more playmaking after that one season where they lost to the Spurs and they got Chris Paul.  He was able to do less with Paul, but Paul was injured so often, Harden ended up having to carry the team a lot."
Who can forget Chris Paul tryin to beat me up
"What snub, he just got selected to becoming an all-star. Why is he choosing now to be petty and being rude to a guy who was congratulating him?  I guarantee Booker would've been more angry if the reporter asked the question ""you've made no improvements over the last 3 years and only got selected to an all-star team because Chris Paul decided to join you. How do you feel?"" It's a no win situation."
"Ok, if the reporter had said ""Hey Devin, you've made no improvements in your game for the last 3 seasons, but you're finally getting recognition and an all-star selection now because Chris Paul decided to join you. How do you feel about that?""  Do you think Booker wouldn't have felt disrespected by this question instead?"
"I agree that by the time Harden became available it was probably too late for the Celtics. They could have got him but wouldn't have had enough left over to compete for a title. The real mistakes were earlier, by not doing enough to land PG, Kawhi, Butler or maybe AD. I think Boston could have landed any one of those guys without totally gutting the team to do so. Considering how highly prized some of the Celtics picks were back then (specifically the Kings, Clippers and Grizzlies picks), they might have been able to land one of those guys without including either Brown or Tatum (maybe Smart and one or two of those picks). Hell, they could have easily got Chris Paul if they'd wanted to. Honestly, they'd be so much better off right now if they'd either traded Hayward for Turner or even just to Charlotte for Batum. Almost any of those moves would have been better than what they did."
"All you need to do is look at which superstars have been traded in the last few years and what they were traded for and ask yourself if Boston could have topped those offers. Look at what Indy traded Paul George for, what Minnesota or Chicago traded Jimmy Butler for, what San Antonio traded Kawhi for, what Houston or OKC traded Chris Paul for.   The Celtics should have *easily* been able to top those trade packages, especially since they had picks that were once highly valued that they could have thrown in (the Kings pick, the Clippers pick and the Grizzlies pick, most notably). They didn't have to trade Tatum and Brown to outbid those other teams for those guys. They also had Kyrie/IT, Horford and Hayward that they could have offered, since they apparently weren't going to be willing to give them another max level contract to keep them.   Instead Boston didn't do anything and just watched as most of those assets crapped out. The max players all just walked in free agency, and the draft picks ended up being much worse than projected and the Celtics had to use them on middling prospects rather than blue chip studs. I can't imagine there's many Boston fans from the last few years who looked at what the future could look like back then who are real happy with how it's currently going. The Celtics seem to be heading in the wrong direction these days, and the clock is ticking on the Jays. If things haven't turned around in the next couple years it's probably just a matter of time before those guys start making trade demands like Kawhi, PG, AD, Butler, etc did when they felt like they were stuck on a team going nowhere."
Chris Paul
Chris Paul is a poor mans Bill Russell
"I mean Harden has played with Dwight Howard, Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook. Those are some pretty big names."
"Russ, Melo, Chris Paul? I mean, not current All Stars, but hardly scrubs."
"Melo, Chris Paul?"
Not as good as Marquese Chris Paul George Hill

chris paul and lebron i would watch every game  edit: rondo and chris paul would be hilarious
except when they were a high seed they lost 4-1 to the warriors and the a chris paul injury imploded leading to them not being able to close 3-2 lead on the warriors. the raptors were 1 seed in 2018 when lebron swept them in the second round. lebron also swept the number one seed hawks in 2015.
Chris Paul George Muresan  7’7 + point god + star wing = win
How about Chris Paul George Foreman?
"Fair fair. You bring up good points although I still have him over Stockton (same level playmaker, better defender and scorer tho) Oscar (put up a lot of WOW numbers in an era with a SUPER fast pace) and Kidd (same level playmakers, but CP is a better scorer and defender then Kidd hands down) and don't know enough about Cousy and Frazier (besides the drip) to make a judgment.   Isiah is a good one to bring up tho. He an amazing leader, defender, playmaker and scorer all in one small package. Probably to most comparable player to Chris Paul actually. Isiah's accolades put him over CP tho I think. It's really hard to argue with a guy who was the best player and leader on a back to back championship team."
"John Stockton has the most assists of all time by almost 4000 which will be extremely hard to surmount because of his longevity and consistency and got to the finals twice which is more than Chris Paul can say but other than that they have very similar resumes, so you have a point but still the assists stat is impressive. A few point guards I could argue are Jason Kidd, isiah Thomas, Bob Cousy and Walt Frazier. I admittedly haven’t watched much of bob cousy or Walt frazier so it’s hard for me personally to argue but they are can be argued and should be considered in the discussion. I’m just saying it’s not so clear cut that he’s top 5 of all time, let alone in the discussion for top 3"
&gt;  but when you start getting into the conversation of top 5 point guards of all time you’re going to need the accolades to back it up and Chris Paul’s resume is lacking in that respect.   What accolades does John Stockton have that Chris Paul does not?  &gt; I could name another few point guards who are arguably just as good but surpass him when it comes to personal and team achievements  Name them
"Reminds me of when Kobe kept bullying Chris Paul in the 2008 Olympics.  During technical FTs, Chris, who was like 98% during the Olympics, would rightfully walk straight to the FT line to shoot the shots....then Kobe, who actually kinda struggled from the line during the Olympics, would come by and push Paul away....but in classic Kobe form, he never missed a technical FT."
chris paul?
Ugh you clearly never read my post where I said just that.   &gt;I mean Chris Paul is one of the top 3-5 all time at his position and **while he did rely on athleticism in his early years** he also had Hall of Fame level playmaking ability from the get go in addition to being an amazing defender from his early career onward. Kemba has never in his entire career been the same level of playmaker or defender Chris Paul has in even his worst years. Not even close.   (emphasis added for your benefit)    And Kemba has never show he is capable of being a plus defender even with his athleticism what makes you think he'll suddenly become one without it?
"ah yes the gentleman's sweep from the warriors was his only other conference finals, however his first two seasons on the rockets 1st round exit, then conference finals with dwight howard team, first round exit, second round exit, chris paul conference finals where they may have won, second round exit, second round exit, and now we are caught up to present"
Harden made the wcf without chris paul on the rockets you know that
okay but didn't they go 60-22 a couple seasons ago and still lost in the ECF or what about the raptors with dense and lowry they were known as regular season teams. harden torches in the regular season but his best year was with chris paul other than that he gets clowned for second round exits
"I mean Chris Paul is one of the top 3-5 all time at his position and while he did rely on athleticism in his early years he also had Hall of Fame level playmaking ability from the get go in addition to being an amazing defender from his early career onward. Kemba has never in his entire career been the same level of playmaker or defender Chris Paul has in even his worst years. Not even close.   They are not even really comparable players, so saying because Chris Paul was able to play well into his late career that Kemba can too doesn't really make sense. Chris Paul is an outlier. It's like saying cuz LeBron has managed to be this good for this long any other wing can to. Doesn't really work for me. So people are just outliers."
"Plus, he's gone from playing next to Chris Paul to...not playing next to Chris Paul. The degree of difficulty is higher this year, and he's still producing at an elite level."
"/r/warriors is too much for me. Too many toxic nephews.   I said I hope Chris Paul gets a ring, and I got downvoted a hundred times."
Chris Paul if he doesn’t get into coaching  Jimmy Butler has a great personality   Danny Green is well spoken and has played with legends  JJ redick has a great podcast and is a funny dude
"Yes it doesn’t guarantee you a title, but it could bring you from being a pretender to an actual contender.   It isn’t like when the Clippers got Kawhi and Paul George it guaranteed then a title, and they only had 2 guaranteed years of Paul George and Kawhi.   The fact is that if you have multiple teams interested in a player. The player is a very good player (all-star caliber) with a great all around game, then he is going to have a good return because of how much better he can make a team.   Look at the difference in Phoenix after acquiring Chris Paul. They went from the lottery to being one of the best teams in the West. Imagine how good Philly would be if they got an actual point guard that works great with both Simmons play style and Embiids play style. Or if the Clippers upgraded Beverly for Lowry.  When you have a team with Lebron and AD and another team with KD, Harden and Kyrie, you need to make moves to actually compete, and title windows are shorter than people expect."
"No he can’t, I’ve watched him get cooked by Chris Paul and Harden in the playoffs on a regular basis. It’s not even an insult to him. You just have to be realistic and know he isn’t a top 5 perimeter defender in the league, and the top 5 guys can’t even guard Harden or KD. He can switch and hold his own better than almost any big. Rudy is a beast but he isn’t a god."
"&gt; Still just poor asset evaluation m, Morey isn’t that stupid.  Lmao Morey loves making big trades to win now. He traded half the Rockets for an expiring Chris Paul, then traded all the draft picks for Westbrook."
"Bruh. Go back and read my original comment. It has literally nothing to do with the picture that dude posted. He tricked you with it and made you think some silly still photo somehow invalidates the fact that the league had 12 All Star spots for 23 teams and now has 12 All Star spots for 30 teams. It should be expanded or every modern player belongs higher on the all time lists than former players. Chris Paul above Magic, LeBron above Jordan, Melo above Bird, etc."
"It has nearly nothing to do with Capela, the problem was Chris Paul and Harden's midrange in this series. Capela by himself doesn't bother Gobert particularly."

"&gt; Chris Paul makes every team he goes to immediately relevant.  They were literally heralded for their transformation end of the season, they were already making strides and becoming relevant without CP3."
"Chris Paul, the Kyle Lowry of the west. Good for him."
"i dgaf what anyone says, chris paul turned the clippers into a billion dollar franchise and was the main reason why stern would not let him go to the lakers, having 2 giants in LA is better for the league than 1"
2016 to present Chris Paul
In his 16 seasons Chris Paul has 62% of the assists that Stockton had. That stat is so bonkers.
"Chris Paul is maybe 9nth best point guard.  Maybe.  But certainly not better than Isiah, Magic and Stockton"
I think Chris Paul should be ranked higher than some might have him.  He's done an amazing job as a leader in turning that team around to 4th in the West.
"On similar usage which I already mentioned (do you not understand what this means?)....on far better efficiency despite facing more challenge on defence. Tell me how Devin Booker was winning before Chris Paul and Ayton came around. Funny enough, Lavine also has more winshares than Booker and his advanced metrics are better than Booker's across the board. Just admit you have no clue what you're talking about and we can move on lol"
"If Chris Paul, who has never been known for his durability, averages 8.5 assist and plays in 30 more games this season then 8 Ast/G for 65 games then 7 Ast/G for 70 games for 3 season in a row (making 20 seasons) he'd barely surpass Kidd by 45 Assist (12136).  That's a long shot"
"Kidd is not a longshot, Stockton is the longshot, if LeBron plays for 3 more seasons after this year he could definitely get there, even moreso for Chris Paul"
"&gt; 3rd place seems reachable for Chris Paul and Lebron  Not just reachable, they'll probably both get there next season (very early next season for Chris Paul)."
"3rd place seems reachable for Chris Paul and Lebron, Kidd remains a long shot and Stockton a dream."
"2019: Ben Simmons first team, missed 16 games  2019: Marcus Smart first team, missed 12 games  2017: Chris Paul first team, missed 21 games   2017: Beverly first team, missed 15 games  Let’s just not pretend that he missed for any other reason than the Pelicans were not good on defense or super relevant and voters by and large do not actually watch games and vote based on team ranking and who gets talked about the most"
"Let’s go through a list of some notable players who refer to Jrue Holiday as one of the game’s best three defenders or as the league’s most underrated players:   [Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Andre Iguodala, Lou Williams, Joe Ingles, JJ Redick.](https://www.thebirdwrites.com/2020/9/9/21428836/jrue-holiday-giannis-lebron-james-ja-morant-all-defensive-pelicans-bucks-clippers-beverley-bledsoe)"
If Zach had Chris Paul helping him create... that would be insane
"I think the tiers up top are a lot more distinct before It becomes kind of a take your guy type of thing.   Tier 1: Curry, Harden  Tier 2: Doncic, Lillard  Tier 3: Chris Paul  Tier 4: Simmons, Trae, Lowry  Tier 5: Holiday, Conley, Ja, Fox, Murray, Kemba, Wall, Brogdon  I put them in the order that I would take the players right now"
"here's my hot take: The only reason beside injuries why CP3 ain't a top 5 player is his size.   ppl been saying what if Iverson were 6'3, what if IT weren't a midget.  The real question is what if Chris Paul is 6'6. He would be another fucking Lebron.  He has all the BBIQ, the skills, the mentality, the control of the game,  and he is a way better shooter too. And pre-injury he fucking posterized Dwight Howard.   Dude almost has the complete package. Only thing he lacks is he size, or, more realistically, some luck."
Chris Paul doesn't feel like a Tier 3 player at all
"Chris Paul as a talent is probably the best Point guard in history. Elite ball handler, passer, playmaker, BBIQ, Clutch, defense, leadership, longevity, and one of the best mid range shooters of all time. Almost everything in the game he does at a good to elite level. I hope he won't be forgotten because he never made the finals (so far) or never won an MVP."
"2008 was Kobe’s peak, it wasn’t a “lifetime achievement” award. If anyone was robbed in 2008, it was Chris Paul."
Chris Paul makes every team he goes to immediately relevant. His time at Wake Forest was such a fun time to watch ACC basketball.
"Dame shoots from behind the screen all the time. He loves that shot, and I'm fine with exaggerating contact there when the defender goes over the screen and runs into his back.   Dame didn't start exaggerating contact until a few years ago when he got frustrated with CP3. Chris Paul always put a hand on Dame's hip and would push when he shot. It fucked up Dame's shot but was never called. So he started exaggerating to get refs to actually call it."
"Absolutely. It's like Barry Bonds level statistical anomaly. No one has ever done 20k points and 10k assists, Lebron's skipping 20/10 for 35/10 minimum and the 40/10/10 is realistic. Even Chris Paul might not make it to the 20k points. It will be like Bonds in the 700 hr, 300 sb club by himself."
"Yes, but Magic would  have been the first to get 10k assists and 20k steals, now it's a race between Lebron and Chris Paul."
Chris Paul in a game this year sunk two of them after the buzzer and they lost by 2
So with that logic should toronto retire kawhi? Should houston retire chris paul?
AD holds franchise records for almost every statistical category outside of assists and steals.. also was the only thing keeping them on the map after Chris Paul left. Plus if Boogie had stayed in NO then maybe AD would never have demanded a trade
"Gobert is the best player on the Jazz imo, but I also think this year Chris Paul not Booker has been the best player on the Suns"
"&gt; Hell, he’s already lead his team to playoffs which is more than Booker has done despite being drafted 3 years after Devin...  He was on a team with a bench that had a top 5 net rating in the NBA. A team with a top 5 net rating has never missed the playoffs... He carried/lead that team to 7th in the west. Not really a carry. If luka wasn't on that team last year they would have been like the Clippers before Kawhi and PG where they had no stars and were a strong team that made the playoffs.   &gt;But he’s doing things nobody has done except those 2 at his ag  He is one of the most high volume PG's ever. Even as a rookie had had a higher USG% than any year of Chris Paul, Steve Nash, Magic Johnson, and John Stockton. He also puts up uncontested Russel Westbrook style uncontested rebounding. He puts up volume stats I'll give you that. However in a league where defense and 3 point shooting is so important, Luka is very overrated and people think he is a top 15 player which is foolish."
"I will bring this up anytime the topic arises.  * Brandon Knight is 6'2"", 182 lbs. * DeAndre Jordan is 6'11"", 265 lbs. * Pau Gasol is 7', 250 lbs.  * Feb. 3, 2013 - Brandon Knight, with his team down three points about half way through the fourth quarter, goes up against Pau Gasol on a fast break. [Knight throws down on Gasol.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow9aUPd2srQ) Nobody says a word about it. * Mar. 10, 2013 - Clippers are the better team. Andre Drummond is still out injured. It's the second quarter, the Clippers are up by 19, Chris Paul (possibly the best passer in the league at the time) throws a lob. Charlie Villanueva is in so the defense is trash, and [Brandon Knight gets dunked on.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTkN2q6sUUk) It's considered the best dunk in years and people are still talking about it.  I will never give Brandon Knight shit for playing defense."
https://youtu.be/S0c_VnwomOU The real highlight of this play SHOULDN'T be Steph Curry's insane move.  It should be Chris Paul BRAVELY and COURAGEOUSLY willing to defend him even if he gets EMBARRASSED 😳
Chris Paul is good at basketball
Chris Paul transcends the box score. It's him
Chris Paul
He saw his boy Chris Paul do this a couple nights ago wanted in
Dude I literally hate Chris Paul probably my least favorite player ever... I should have said nothing
"Brown or Randle over Tatum. Chris Paul over Beal. Sabonis over Gobert. If it was possible, I’d put Jokic over KD for 1st team. Carrying the team for most of the year in a categories. Just insane.   Feels like you made this All NBA based on who has a better 2K rating"
That Chris Paul three on lonzo was filthy .
"His career assist to turnover ratio compared to other great all-time point guards:     - Chris Paul, 3.91.   - John Stockton, 3.73.   - Jason Kidd, 3.03.    - Steve Nash, 2.97.   - Magic Johnson, 2.89."
Chris Paul is the best player on the Suns.
**4x NBA Assists leader Chris Emmanuel Paul**
id put chris paul over mitchell rn and over paul george i might put sabonis? but thats only cuz of the games played
"We have tons of players with that mentality, like Lebron James, Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook, Brad Wanamaker, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, ect ect."
"Yeah, Chris Paul is probably a pyscho with less ability and a couple of bad bounces.."
* LBJ * Westbrook * Chris Paul  Are all active players who have a similiar mindset.
Good job Milwaukee getting Holiday over fuckin CHRIS PAUL
"Chris Paul is amazing to watch. When him or Steve Nash has the ball in their hands, you know something great is gonna happen."
"Real question, have you watched basketball for more than a year or two?  Because you don't seem to understand that in order to win MVPs or titles you need great teammates.  Chris paul is considered an all time great, how many MVPs and titles has he won?  Does that mean he's all of a sudden a player who ""wasted his potential""?  Unless you're an idiot who only looks at stats, of course not."
Man I have hated Chris Paul for almost a decade now but he just keeps producing and his past two seasons of turning mediocre teams into two playoff teams in the west deserves props. There is no reason that the Thunder should have taken Houston to 7 games but this motherfucker just willed it to happen out of spite.
Comparison to Chris Paul. Not that he's significantly below that
Probably because he has played most of his minutes with the greatest offensive guards of all time. How many minutes has he shared with Chris Paul? That is why he is that high.
"Lol your entire comment is just about defense, nobody is trying to claim harden is some great defender. He’s about average on that end and good in certain situations, the nets are actually about league average on defense with him on the floor.  They’ve beat every top team in the league. Hardens shot creating and playmaking had lead teams further then Anthony Davis has with his elite defense. There’s a reason hardens been an MVP finalist every fucking season since 2014. He should have about 3 MVPs and has been first team 6 straight times. He’s lead his team to the conference finals twice, should have won a title if Chris Paul was healthy in 18, and only lost in the first round 3/8 seasons. Made the playoffs every single season. He’s been more successful then Anthony Davis and his play has translated to more wins"
chris paul going to talk him afterwards is pretty fucking nice
&gt; Best individual season: KG  I don't know man. Garnett in 2008 was such monster but so was Chris Paul in 2014 and 2015. I'd also probably pick Garnett but I don't think it's right out given.
Oldest great still playing: LeBron  Baby goat: Doncic  Lamar:Harden  Donald: Giannis  Deshaun: KAT  Best Duo: LeBron and AD  Fastest player: DeAaron Fox  Strong for position: Marcus Smart  Drew Brees: Dwight howard  Barry Sanders: Chris paul  Jamarcus Russell: Darko Milicic
"The trade sucks in a vacuum but in the long run shedding that salary was part of what allowed the team to sign Oubre and Rubio, eventually leading to Chris Paul. Melton was a casualty of James Jones hitting the reset switch that off-season, but honestly Jevon is a fan favorite and Cam Payne has been a revelation, so it's hard to feel too down about the deal."
"That's pretty solid logic. Kawhi, Chris Paul and for a while DeRozan were our kryptonite because the shots that they wanted to take are the same shots we want our opponents to take. We can and will adjust over a series but in this mid-season games the Clippers are basically perfect to exploit our scheme.  I won't deny that I underestimated them, I was not expecting Morris to be this absolute god that he's been this year, and I wasn't expecting their defense to be as insane as it is."
"It seems like a guy who is 6’6,” 225 who has the same skill set as a guy who’s 6’2” 190 will just end up being more successful in the NBA. But once you’ve established yourself, it shouldn’t matter as long as you are successful. Chris Paul, AI, those guys are considered all time greats, but that’s because they were successful in spite of their height. You could argue that it would be tough to win a title with a smaller guy as your best player, but Steph Curry would beg to differ. And even when it’s a bigger guy, they always have help anyway. Lebron is amazing, but didn’t win a title until he had either a future hof (wade, ad) or a super star in their own right (love, Irving). I firmly believe the blazers could win a title with someone like Paul George as their second best player, and Lillard as the first. Sorry, mini rant about player height over."
Chris Paul is a demon. Dude hits more contested shots than i hit when I’m wide open
Chris Paul doing this at 36 is nuts
"The past 20 yrs on shots 14-23 ft [these are the leaders in % who played at least 12,000 min and took at least 1000 such shots](https://www.pbpstats.com/totals/nba/player?Season=2020-21,2019-20,2018-19,2017-18,2016-17,2015-16,2014-15,2012-13,2013-14,2011-12,2010-11,2009-10,2008-09,2000-01,2001-02,2002-03,2004-05,2003-04,2005-06,2006-07,2007-08&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason)  1) Nash 47.8%  2) Dirk 47.2%  3) Horford 47%  4) David West 47%  5) Chris Paul 46.8%  6) Khris Middleton 46.7%  7) Jason Terry 46.7%  8) Steph 46.6%  9) CJ 46.4%  10) Brandon Bass 46.3%  Other notable ones  Durant 44.5%(I thought it would be a little higher)  Kobe 40.8%  Melo: 41.0%  KG: 45.2%  LeBron: 38.3%  Aldridge: 41.1%  DWade: 38.6%  Iverson: 39.3%  DeRozan: 39.6%  Lowest amongst 800 attempts for this stretch  Tony Allen 32%  Quentin Richardson 32%  Trevor Ariza: 32.9%  Corey Brewer: 33.1%  Derrick Favors: 33.2%  Josh Smith: 33.9%"
Chris Paul is the textbook example for why stats aren't the be all end all in basketball. Dude absolutely controlled and dominated the game last night
I want to see Chris Paul on a team coached by Byron Scott
"Johnson died on February 28, 2018 after James Harden cooked him and put him in a bodybag. He could not be rushed to the hospital as his ankles were glued to the ground. Wesley's funeral will be held in the secret tunnel Chris Paul used to get to the locker room. His mother, Mary Johnson, later disowned him posthuously.  Never forget this legendary wikipedia edit."
Chris Paul ran that 4th QTR offense like a professor giving a lecture on advanced bball tactics
"Chris Paul or not, the Suns were gonna make the playoffs this year. They weren't tanking."
"I gotta disagree with this. Wade maybe but he won rings, but with CP3 it’s definitely part of his story. In Houston he’s Chris “hamstring away from the finals” Paul"
"I've watched less of him so maybe you're right, but in general I just don't believe in undersized point guards (I've been watching the celtics trot out IT and Kemba Walker and seen the negatives that come with them).  It is unprecedented for a small guard to lead a team to a championship.  the closest comp is Curry, but Curry is bigger, more athletic, and just all around better than Trae.  Chris Paul also comes to mind, but he is longer and more athletic and one of the best defensive guard ever - and he hasn't ever won anything, primarily due to injuries (and I think being an undersized guard, you're more likely to get injured).  on top of all that, while he is truly a prolific passer, he also seems to have a habit of making some bad/lazy plays.  I do think he will continue to improve and maybe cut the bad turnovers out of his game, but the rest of my points still stand.  so yes, he's a great offensive talent, but I would not want to build my team around him.  I would rather have a less talented but bigger 2-way player."
"Yes there's lots of variance, but there are definitely degrees to how different teams and individual defenders factor in shooting ability. Chris Paul comes to mind as a defender who helps way more off of non-shooters, cost them badly in that Rockets-Clippers series."
Chris Paul just built different
"Chris Paul is pretty far from the 3 best point guard. A guy who never won anything, and never was really considered close to the best player in the league shouldn’t be considered that high."

"And then he got hurt like he does. That's why he's not underappreciated. Like clockwork, a Chris Paul team flames out in the playoffs every year. Bad luck, injuries, whatever, it's why he is looked at as a floor raiser"
hot take but this Chris Paul guy seems like a pretty good basketball player
"Magic, Jerry West, Curry? I love Chris Paul but he isn't gonna be top 3 probably ever unless you consider Jerry a 2 but honestly, when I bring him up as a 2, people say he's a 1 so wtf. lol"
No what I’m saying is I don’t think we would’ve seen any better or any worse Version of Chris Paul. I think he would’ve still been seen at the level he’s currently seen at
Watching Chris Paul play basketball is one of my favorite things.
chris paul is one of the highest IQ players ever and mechanically gifted in almost every aspect of the game. he will age gracefully or as well as most of the greats that played late into the game.
I would take a small bet that Chris Paul will become a Laker when his current contract is up.
If Chris Paul was taller he’d be another Lebron
"Chris Paul has sooo much value, bringing the suns to the playoffs like he did with OKC last year."
"Chris Paul is top 5 clutch players in the NBA maybe top 3, dude is always hitting clutch shots or going off in the 4th quarter"
"Chris ""Smoothie King"" Paul"
"In the one good year chris paul had with us (where he had 18/8 ... meanwhile khris middleton had 18/6.) we won 65 games and chris paul was out for 1/4 of the season, while our 3 next best players missed significant time. I can tell you that we would've killed for ANYONE who shot as good as brogdon that year. Our best shooter was ryan f'ing anderson who missed just as many games as brogdon did.    The point is yes, Giannis got 60 wins. But as far as good teams go that's fairly pedestrian. Harden did something that no one since MJ did."
Chris Paul a bitch
It’s Chris Paul trying to beat me up.
"""Chris Paul is tryna assault me"""
"Dude Zo was fantastic for 3 quarters, in complete control. But for some reason he only comes into the 4th after Chris Paul roasts the bench and has all the momentum on his side."
"There are guys who change the momentum of games. We have a problem in later halves of games where we face adversity and we kind of just settle.  That's why the Suns pay Chris Paul his bag. He put his team on his back and set them up on a great run. He changed game momentum by picking apart the defense and hyping up his guys.  The ""leader"" isn't always the face of a franchise, it's often a seasoned vet who just knows what they're doing and can help direct the team."
Chris paul and the thunder dissecting the nets in OT at Atlantic Center
100%.  We don't have a Draymond Green/Chris Paul/Jimmy Butler who forces guys to stay active/aggressive on the floor.
Chris Paul hasn't won anything tho
Chris Paul shimmy on Curry. Can’t remember what happened after that :)
"Chris ""Draymond Green"" Paul"
his length and athletic ability completely covered for his lack of BBIQ. that and chris paul. he got the all NBA based upon dunking and blocking shots. insane.   that shit is a black eye on the all nba teams and you might be right saying it's the biggest joke in NBA history.

Chris Paul went vegan before OKC. I believe this 100% has had a affect on his conditioning
Chris Paul is so underrated
Missed opportunity to just say Chris Paul George
"I don't understand how people do not grasp this fact. Devin Booker has been in the league for six years. His team has been under .500 in five of those years.   Then suddenly Chris Paul shows up, and they're a game behind the Lakers.   ""Oh, Booker's better than Chris Paul.""  Did you watch what he did for OKC last year? Did you watch the way he turned one of the most moribund franchises in the NBA into a really, really good and supremely entertaining team? Did you watch the 2008 Hornets or the 2018 Rockets?   Chris Paul has literally *never* been on a bad team. A few mediocre teams. But *never* a bad team. That's because Chris Paul elevates everything around him, and has done so his whole career."
"I definitely agree that Chris Paul is more impactful than Book. As for all the other All Stars, idk, but I think actually watching games is a better way to judge impact than looking at stats which can be misleading"
"the comment you originally replied to said ""Chris Paul getting in is more bullshit than Zion"""
Haha Suns fans are so sad Booker didn’t make it and projecting it onto Zion instead of Chris Paul
"It’s not that the style of play wins. It’s that Chris Paul changed the play style to suit him and that in turn has led to wins It’s undeniable that the team has done a complete 180 in style of play. Do you honestly believe this roster would be a playoff team with Chris Paul? I’m not denying the talent of the surrounding pieces but it’s not a coincidence that the eye test, advanced metrics and the coaches agree that Chris Paul is the reason for the Suns success."
"He's clearly impactful, but Is he as impactful as the guys who made it?  Imo, no.  Chris Paul drives that team."
"I have watched every single suns game. Chris Paul has been the driving force for the teams success. Booker started to pick up his play recently. Chris Paul picked up his play before that. He's controls the teams offense and has been key on defense. If Booker played like he is now the whole season, he would be an all-star. But he didn't. Playing average for most of the season and playing at all star level for the rest isn't going to get you the nod"
"This guy kinda has it wrong  Derozan is still the leader for the Spurs and just because hes taken a step back doesn't mean he isnt still the leader. Derozan is who gets the ball in the clutch, he is the one consistently making plays. Hes definitely playing more of a Chris Paul role by setting up his teammates and picking and choosing when to get his."
With this same exact logic then the Suns are better because they have Chris Paul and you shouldn’t have even typed out bookers name.
"You can look at how they weren’t good last year outside a 8 game hot streak. Then Paul comes in, Suns start winning more games. Last year the Suns were 10th in pace, this year 29th. Chris Paul plays slow, half-court, winning basketball. The Suns now play slow, half-court, winning basketball. Chris Paul completely changed Phoenix’s system around and they’re winning because of that. That’s the kinda of impact that doesn’t show up in a box score. It’s a coach vote and coach’s understand who’s better."
"Dude it’s just hard to be a guard in the west. He made it last year. It’s unfortunate but all his counting stats are down from last year. He’s averaging 24/4/3. Who do you replace to put him in?  Dame? LOL.  Donovan Mitchell? Same exact stats and MUCH better defense on the best team in the NBA. Sorry. PG13? Better numbers, better efficiency, MUCH better defense, better team. Sorry. Chris Paul? Maybe. Could’ve been a toss up between the two of them. Paul got the nod, I’d have given it to Book, but I don’t argue with the decision.  The kicker is that AD will miss the game and they’ll have to name a replacement. I assume it’ll go to Mike Conley (because of the narrative and that fact that by almost every conceivable advanced metric he’s been the best player in the NBA this year), but I wouldn’t be surprised if Booker gets it.  Tl;dr: there’s a lot of incredible players in the west and an absolute max of 7 backcourt all-star spots. Booker is arguably the 7the or 8th best backcourt player in the conference. “The excuses have run out” seems pretty dramatic."
Yea Chris Paul and zion were the wildcard picks
"Wrong. Per Yahoo,   Western Conference G: Damian Lillard  G: Chris Paul  FC: Anthony Davis  FC: Rudy Gobert  FC: Zion Williamson  WC: Donovan Mitchell  WC: Paul George"
Nonsense. That team without Chris Paul isn't a playoff team. That team with Chris Paul is one game behind the Lakers.  Same thing with CP3 last year in OKC.   The fact that his counting stats aren't on par with some guys does not change the fact that he's still a better basketball player who drives winning.
"Honestly Chris Paul is to blame. He should’ve fighting for the injury replacement with Demar with Book voted in, not the other way around"
Bro just look at the advanced metrics. Chris Paul is a whole tier above Booker
I've watched a fair amount of sun's this year and Chris Paul seemed like the clear choice of the two for me. I'm curious as to why people are surprised by it
"Did Chris Paul not make it in 2017-2018. If not, that seems dumb."
Chris Paul getting in is more bullshit than Zion
"Most Suns fans wanted Booker because he deserves to be there and Chris Paul has plenty appearances already lol, but the west had many that deserved to be there no doubt."
zion is the better player.  pretty sure the coaches gave it to chris paul because of the impact on winning he's had on the suns
Then tell that to the voters. I didn't put Chris Paul in over Booker. But he doesn't deserve to be in over Zion for any reason at all.
"Because Chris Paul is also an all-star, and their record is not all the way up top like the Utah Jazz. It's always gonna be tougher in the West."
Chris Paul rightfully picked over Booker
"I disagree with Shaq, KG, Dirk not being influential. All three were very influential on and off the court.  I think it's probably harder to find a player that is *only* dominant or influential or pioneering.  Here's some that maybe fit:  Dominant and not pioneering/influential:  Moses Malone, Rick Barry, Alex English,  Chris Webber   Pioneering but not dominant/influential:  Paul Pressey (as a point forward), Bill Laimbeer (3pt shooting big man), Robert Horry (3 and D forward)  Influential but not dominant/pioneering:  Yao Ming, Vince Carter   Obviously all of these guys have all three qualities to some degree though."
"Chris Paul, LETS FUCKING GO!  it really is incredible. He’s 36 years old and doesn’t have an imposing physical profile. It’s insane he’s still this good."
"[Charania] Sources: The East are tantalised by James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic. And the West are enamoured with Chris Paul, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis"
"I understand that, but offensively: Kyrie Irving right now is better than Chris Paul was during his time with Houston. I’m not sure this is debatable  Kyrie was second team all nba 2018-2019  year, but got injured. Harden clearly didn’t want to carry the scoring load and CP3 at that point in his career wasn’t doing what Kyrie is now, where Harden can naturally transition into a PG role."
He lost out to Chris Paul
"Lol except it's not ""win and everybody on your team gets into the allstar game"". They put Chris Paul in.   Y'all can be salty all you want but Zion has been objectively better than Booker this year. Especially with the super slow start Booker had."
"West: Chris Paul, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis   East: James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic  Just a feeling I have"
Chris Paul is the 31st coach
"Definitely feel for Pacers and Raptors fans being the only teams in the top 8 unrepresented in the East. Think I would have preferred Booker over Chris Paul, but I know coaches love Paul, so not shocked. With Davis almost certainly out, it will be interesting to see who gets his spot. I'm not sure Booker is an auto lock for it, but probably the favorite"
"Kyrie is averaging 27/4/5 on 52/40/90 splits. Chris Paul at no point during his stretch with Houston was that great offensively. Defense I could agree, but when Harden made his comments concerning not wanting to score 40 a night, he was clearly talking offense."
Chris Paul George. You ain't slick Shams
So Chris Paul over Devon Booker
Chris Paul over Booker?
Anyone who thought the coaches wouldn’t pick Chris Paul hasn’t been paying attention.
"Yea, [for about a year and a half now](https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a30500407/chris-paul-diet-vegetarian/).  Seems to be paying dividends."
Kyrie right now is currently playing better than any Chris Paul harden played with
Is chris paul vegan?
Don't know where you got this from. 2017-2018 season:  Chris Paul and Harden: +12.84   Only Chris Paul: 12.37  Only Harden: 8.64  They are clearly the best when on the court together.
Chris paul is currently on a consulting tour

"Chris Paul deserves credit for making them home court contenders, but not playoff contenders. A lot of people argue that differential is a better indication of how good or bad a team is and Suns were actually [8th in the west last year](https://www.espn.com/nba/standings/_/season/2020) having a positive differential for the entire year. Their starters were really good but their biggest problem was their bench and lack off backup PG. They got Cam Payne who played awesome and capped off their season with that 8-0 bubble run. Take this along with the natural progression of young players (Booker, Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson) and pretty good veteran additions (Jae Crowder, Galloway, Moore). If they had the same team as last year I think they would have have been fighting for 8-6th range instead of the current 5th-3rd range. Chris Paul turned a borderline playoff team to home court contender."
"I love Chris Paul and I think he deserves a lot of credit, but not necessarily as much credit as some people are giving him. There is a strong argument that differential is a better indication of how good or bad a team is and Suns were actually [8th in the west last year](https://www.espn.com/nba/standings/_/season/2020) having a positive differential for the entire year. Their starters were really good but their biggest problem was their bench and lack off backup PG. They got Cam Payne who played awesome and capped off their season with that 8-0 bubble run.

Not a bad team. Not necessarily saying you called the Suns a bad team in this situation but I know a lot of people have."
"I truly don’t understand how this subreddit has adopted this narrative lol. Suns were a good team last year. They had Ayton miss a ton of games, and their performance in the bubble showed they were better than their record.     And yet their success this season is somehow entirely due to Chris Paul."
"The whole 1 year rental point aside, did we not go for it with the Kyrie trade and the Hayward signing? That didn’t exactly work out. It’s not like you can simply trade for a top 5 player every single year and automatically win a chip. If it were that easy every team would go for it every single year.  Also what about the Clippers selling the farm and being a 2nd round exit last year? Or the Rockets going after Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook and not making the finals? There are plenty of teams that make trades and it doesn’t work in the first year, or at all, and if all the Celtics were getting were likely 1 year rentals why would you do that and have to start rebuilding as Tatum is getting around to that start-of-prime-years range?  The reference of the Heat going for it with Jimmy Butler was also kind of strange, since didn’t Philadelphia do the exact same thing with him and they didn’t make the finals? It’s all just painting a picture to fit this narrative.  These media nephews need to chill on the Boston slander and leave that to fans and redditors."
Chris Paul
chris paul
Devin Booker 25/4/4 on 50/38/85 61% TS  Donovan Mitchell 25/4/5 on 43/39/83 56% TS  Chris Paul 17/5/9 on 49/40/97 59% TS  Mike Conley 16/3/6 on 44/41/82 59% TS  Demar DeRozan 20/5/7 on 49/33/89 60% TS  Three of these players should be all-stars. Tell me there is no world in which Booker deserves it.
devin booker has been on that team for years and they've never been even remotely good but now Chris Paul joins and they're playoff contenders.  I think you know which one should be the all star
"It's incredible what Chris Paul does for every team he goes to, very underrated because he didn't win a ring, but he makes bad teams competitive overnight."
Jrue is a heck of a player... But he isn't the leader Chris Paul is...  Jrue is like the Kawhi of guards... He just does great things... But he doesn't lead or rally his team mates like a Chris Paul or other floor generals do. Jrue is a bigger and higher IQ Bledsoe... Bledsoe is fine player though but Jrue is more versatile both ways.
"You are right mainly... Booker getting a lot of the accolades is concerning... I've seen every game for the last 5 years... And Booker has not changed much except give up play making duties to Chris Paul more.  What I see... Is Ayton changing his game from being a scoring big man to a defensive specialist who has given up offensive touches and role but his team impact has gone up tremendously. I also see Bridges becoming more aggressive offensively... I see Johnson becoming better.  Addition of Chris Paul, Moore, Crowder have given the team a veteran group to follow and listen to.   Chris Paul bringing leadership is number 1 though.... That is clear to me. I see him telling players off or coaching them on and off the court. I mean Rubio did that last year too but Chris Paul is more vocal and a stronger leader.... Booker is not a very good leader as he just yells at players... But Chris Paul... His leadership is absolutely key. Just like previous star guards that came before him on the Suns... In Nash, Kidd, KJ etc."
Chris Paul has been randomly selected for performance enhancing drug testing.
"Suns are winning because of defense mainly... Booker has always scored well... But the team defense anchored by Ayton, Bridges and a plethora of versatile wings and guards are as guilty of the success as much as Booker... Offensively and culture wise... Chris Paul is clearly the main catalyst...  I like what I see from Booker but we all know he's an elite scorer.... Success is mainly due to defense and Chris Paul bringing in leadership and raising player accountability."
"He's going 3rd or 4th depending on how high you rate SGA. Otherwise, there really isn't a debate for anyone else. Ayton's production is exactly what we expected out of him. The guy was an 18/12 guy last year as a second year pro... how dare his ppg drop a few points because he sacrifices some extra touches for some extra wins, thanks to Chris Paul.   Why do young guys have to peek early to get any respect?"
Lol this is like when Chris Paul busted out the “too small” at “backup 4” Justin holiday in a game this year
And people are talking about whether Chris Paul *or* Devin Booker deserve an All-Star spot.
For me its Chris Paul. Watching him use his handles to get to his spot and pull up from mid range never gets old.
We would never trade Chris Paul
"Yeah those are all fair reasons, much better than just listing ppg's. I think saying Conleys ppg is absolutely underselling his impact, similar to how saying ""Chris Paul is only scoring 16.6ppg how can he be in over Booker"". Maybe not to 100% of the same extent, but similar.   FWIW I think id have it as either very close between them or them both over Zion for the last spot, it's definitely not ""awful"" though. If you really do think that id encourage you to watch more Jazz basketball because Conley really has been excellent this season."
How wasn’t it?   Chris Paul was traded 3 separate times in the time period the Celtics made the ECF with multiple first round picks on the horizon
"&gt;Every trade has a problem for you.  Not trying to be pedantic, but it's very telling that you won't argue that the Celtics should've given up Jaylen and Jayson for AD (because it's indefensible to make that argument, but I digress)  &gt;Yet even a team like the Suns look better than the Celtics this year for getting Chris Paul.  Yeah, the Suns are probably better the Celtics this year, they're a top 5 team in the NBA rn. I didn't think swapping Kemba and CP3 is the sort of ""big trade"" that you were describing."
Every trade has a problem for you.   Yet even a team like the Suns look better than the Celtics this year for getting Chris Paul. You can poke a hole in everything except the fact Angie couldn’t pull the trigger
"So let's walk through those guys:  Kawhi would have commanded *at least* Jaylen Brown and multiple firsts. You think the Celtics should've done that deal?  Anthony Davis would have commanded Jayson Tatum, probably Jaylen Brown and multiple firsts. You think the Celtics should've done that deal?  James Harden would have commanded Tatum or Brown and multiple firsts, and he was actively sabotaging a team he didn't want to be on.  Russell Westbrook is not a player the Celtics should have traded for under any circumstances.  Jimmy Butler would have commanded at least Jaylen Brown, and he ditched a contender for Miami. You think the Celtics should've made that trade?  Chris Paul I agree with but the Celtics would've needed to include Brown and Smart for salary matching purposes, and no one in the league thought he'd be a positive asset.  The Celtics were objectively right in hindsight not to trade for Cousins.  &gt;The fact that the Raptors are currently ahead of Boston in the standings and went game 7 against them after they lost Kawhi is pretty telling as well.  In that series when Hayward was out with injury and Kemba played only 3 games after coming back from a knee injury? Yeah, it's telling, just not the way you think."
"Is putting 16.6ppg Chris Paul abover Booker not disrespectful then too?  Conley has been amazing this year, similarly to how CP3 has been for the Suns. He's the best at running our offense by a distance and has been fantastic on defense this year. His raw numbers don't look that impressive, but both him and CP3 are loved by most advanced metrics while Booker is not."
"You can say “Keep in mind” but the team that traded for Kawhi won a ring the year they traded for him, and the team that traded for AD won a ring the year they traded for him. Paul George also re-signed in OKC so his “LA or bust” thing wasn’t even true.   However here are some notable players that were traded in recent years;  Kawhi Leonard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Russell Westbrook  Jimmy Butler (twice)   Chris Paul (3 times)  DeMarcus Cousins  With a few of those players being traded for notably less than the value people expected. Like it is sweet that the Celtics managed to make a consistently good team, but when you make an ECF and are swimming in future picks it makes sense to try and make upgrades instead of consistently drafting 3-4 rookies a year with the majority not having room to fit in the roster.   Like in 2019 the Celtics added rookies Tremont Waters, Romeo Langford, Carsen Edwards, Javonte Green, Grant Williams, Tacko Fall, Vincent Poirier.  The fact that the Raptors are currently ahead of Boston in the standings and went game 7 against them after they lost Kawhi is pretty telling as well.  I don’t really care for the excuses, Boston just hasn’t been able to pull the trigger to actually make them contenders."
"Not even, Gobert guards Jokic well in 80-90% of their games, it's just that Jokic scores anyway. Gobert's defense has two weaknesses and both are indirectly caused by the system we built on him. The first is defending the pnr against extremely talented midrange shooters (Chris Paul, Kawhi and the like). Gobert's joint responsibilities of preventing the lob, preventing the drive and contesting the midrange is too much for anyone to physically do so we bleed points in the mid range there.  The second is keeping up with speedy guards on the perimeter, but that's to be expected as a 7 foot guard."
"Ah, the old Chris Paul Defense."
"When OKC was shopping Westbrook, many Heat fans including myself didn't want him and his contract in exchange for Herro (and a few picks?).  They managed to flip him into Chris Paul and rumors were recirculating that OKC could trade him to the Heat for the same package that would have been used for Westbrook.  I didn't want the trade because CP3 also had an overbearing contract and was due any day now for regression from age right?  If Miami had traded for CP3 they'd probably have secured last year's championship and would still be favorites this season."
Chris Paul/ James Harden/ TMac/ Hakeem/ Yao  Or if you want my 2k all time lineup  Harden/ Moses/ Hakeem/ Sampson/ Yao  I call this MEGA ball
Chris Paul  James Harden  TMac  Moses Malone  Hakeem Olajuwonn
"I was kinda joking about it, but I don't see him trying to pull that stunt on Chris Paul just to name one you know what I mean?"
like Chris Paul?
"ah yes, the Stockton stans are out in full force.  Ask Chris Paul what he thinks about Stockton?"
"No I perfectly get how great of a passer he is. You're overrating the hell out of him and I'm guessing based off the fact your top 3 are all star players and those 3 star players specifically that you judge passing off assists.  The top 3 passers are Jokic, Rubio, and either Ben Simmons or Chris Paul in the 3rd spot. Harden and Lebron are great passers but it complements their scoring games. They're scoring threats more than they're like Magic/Kidd/Nash in that they find cracks in a defense and set up their teammates primarily and get the most out of their teammates."
"Barkley, Hakeem, Draxler.  Kobe, Shaq, Payton, Malone.  Chris Paul, Harden."
"I will semi joking with that post. Personally I would go with the Rockets.  Hakeem with James Harden, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony and TMac if we are going with primes"
"Chris ""Cash Considerations"" Paul"
"&gt;Conley has had a better season then Chris Paul if that’s what you mean,   I really hope that's not what you mean lol."
Sparing the 2 point outing by chris paul is fine with me 😂
"Get a better 5. I don’t care if he can shoot or not, I just want a more imposing defensive 5. Adams has been good, but he’s not like a defensive anchor. He will work for now.   Then a great point guard. The dream player for that is Chris Paul, won’t happen unfortunately. The fun idea is somehow winning the lottery for Cade. A tall point guard would be nice. I don’t really know a realistic fit for the 1 though, I guess an all star to fringe all star level guy who can facilitate and score on all levels."
Weird how adding Chris Paul helped them win more
Chris Paul had 2 points but 9 assists tonight. Booker put up 34. They're valuable to the team in different ways
"Nah, it's a fair question. To start the year, Booker was turning the ball over relentlessly, I think he was averaging more turnovers than assists for a decent amount of time. He's also still not a very good defender, though that probably won't ever change much. Those two things along with subpar scoring efficiency (especially for him) really tanked his advanced stats. That being said, I think there's something to be said about adjusting to playing with CP3, especially with the pace of play. As they've both seemed to have gotten more comfortable, Booker has been playing a hell of a lot better.  CP3 being the metric darling makes sense. Book is still my favorite Suns player, but I think it would be tough to argue that anyone not named Chris Paul has been their best player. Ayton's defense is pretty underrated at this point, and Bridges has an argument for one of the best role players in the league depending on how you define that, so them being rated highly makes sense too. But what numbers aren't really able to capture is how a team schemes around you, and at the end of the day Booker is going to be someone teams spend a lot of time game planning around, so I don't really think Ayton or Bridges have much of an argument for steering the ship. They're just playing extremely well within their role"

That Suns v Clippers 2nd round is gonna be wild. Chris Paul vengeance tour 2021
"Conley has had a better season then Chris Paul if that’s what you mean, and Zion is not debatable for Book or CP3. If you want to say the suns have been doing so good they deserve multiple all stars, the Jazz have been so good they deserve 3-4."
"There's a Night and Day difference between Chris Paul and Draymond's offensive ability, from anywhere on the court. The handles, superior BBIQ, the agility. Everything. Massive difference  &gt;   But the fact that a ""cold"" CP3 can still impact the game like that.. is quite insane. Definitely feels like a Draymond or Rodman type performance, just with less rebounds"
What's crazy is that they already had a good veteran guard in Ricky Rubio. Chris Paul is god tier. I will never doubt him again.
"Let’s be honest though, this is all Chris Paul. I think we knew Booker would never lead his team to wins as the first option"
"Honestly, it is. I was thinking it's nice that a cold Chris Paul just turns into Daymond Green"
"HIM AND CHRIS PAUL ARE BOTH ALL STARS!*    (IT IS A TOUGH CHOICE AND I UNDERSTAND IF ONLY ONE MAKES IT, BUT STILL!!)"
Chris paul 2 points?
"I think Chris Paul becomes more of a 14/4/8 guy this year   Butler I see your reasoning, very possible   Valancunis is gonna start regressing imo due to the role New Orleans is gonna force him into.   We could see some real decline from Russ between another year eating at his athleticism and his weird role in LAL."
Chris Paul
Chris Paul
Chris Paul was a great player but Giannis was better and Chris turned the ball over in the clutch too many times
The crazy thing about Stockton’s longevity is he didn’t start until age 25. Chris Paul already has the same number of seasons as a starter. If Stockton came into the league at 18 like a lot of star players today and had a coach that would’ve started him from the beginning he could’ve played several hundred more games.
Anyone remember the playoff series Clippers lost to the Blazers after Chris Paul broke his hand while trying to hold Gerald Henderson’s shorts?
"Chris Paul  missed 2 games and was the ghost of himself for quite a few more after the injury vs the Lakers, he was killing the team for awhile."
"for me… Celtics vs. Suns  I hate Boston, and I hate Chris Paul"
Let’s chill with the recency bias lmao Chris Paul was looked at like John Wall in 2019
Bobby Portis is becoming one of my fav players.  I feel sad that CP was given Foster in the finals. Obviously Foster's never going to let CP win anything. Regardless of what you think of Chris Paul it's fucked up that Foster's so obviously dirty.
"No, we never could have gotten AD. He wanted to play in LA and LA only, thats the advantage they have over everyone else. I’m sure they tried for paul george in the 2017 off season who was younger and would have been the ideal fit for harden but they couldn’t match OKCs larger offer. Chris Paul was the best we could do, and they were a GOAT level team the first season. They tried a huge offer for jimmy and they said no in 2018. We lost a bunch of role players, Chris Paul fell off and his value was at an all time low. The swap for russ was risky but was a last ditch effort on a plan that looked like it failed with CP3s worst year. Nobody knew hed come back like that"
"Wall isn't like Westbrook or Chris Paul. Wall isn't and hasn't played. He has less value than oladipo, and he's getting the minimum. There are massive contracts you can trade, but those players have some sort of value. What value does wall have? A shitty team (at the time) like the Wizards didn't want anything to do with him. It says a lot on the *actual* value of the player."
"AI was a very inefficient player whose counting stats were inflated by the fact that the Sixers' offensive strategy was ""give the ball to Iverson."" Some of his inefficiency is forgivable do to that fact, and it's not like anybody else on the Sixers was going to score, and the entire league was pretty inefficient at the time, but I still feel like team players like Chris Paul and Steve Nash are often overshadowed by Iverson solely because they were allowed to blend into a team system.   I'm curious to see how Iverson would've developed if he had a better attitude and if the Sixers built a better roster around him. How would we remember Iverson if the Sixers drafted Dirk or Paul Pierce in the 1998 draft instead of Larry Hughes, or if they drafted Chauncy Billups or Tracy McGrady in the 1997 draft instead of Kieth Van Horn?   If Iverson was part of a duo, I think his mythos would wear off. I think he'd be more remembered like a better Russell Westbrook, the most athletic guy on the court, and a guy who can really fill up a stat sheet, though not very efficiently."
"His career minutes aren't super high. He averaged 1.9 steals per 36, vs all-time Steals leadership Stockton at 2.5, but Stockton's an outlier. Chris Paul in 5th all-time is at 2.2. If Muggsy had more minutes (CP has +30% career minutes on Muggsy and still has a good few years left in him), he'd be way higher in the list, probably top 20. (Garnett, in 19th, averaged only 1.3/36)."
"Started *really* watching in 2017, I live near DC so I felt obliged to root for the Wizards as frustrating as they were, and James Harden quickly became my favorite player (should've won at least one more MVP smh) so I loved the Rockets too, not to mention Chris Paul and Westbrook have been two of my favorites since before I even really watched much basketball so their stints in Houston made it natural for me to root for the Rockets too. Harden's playstyle is one of my favorite things to watch and the 0-27 game is probably the saddest I've been cuz of sports since the 2010 world cup final"
chris paul.. clippers flair🤔🤔
"If you like that lets compare it to an active player.      36 year old Chris Paul is 5th all-time in assists, the most amongst active players. He'd need to play 5 straight seasons and average at least 12.0 assists per game, while missing just 5 games each season, to pass Stockton.      The reason I chose 12.0 is because the last player to match or exceed that average was Stockton in 1994-95.      That 1994-95 season was the 8th straight season for Stockton averaging at least 12.0 assists!          (Not relevant to the stat before he averaged 16/3/13.3 with 2.7 steals on 52/38/83 shooting over these years just further emphasise his greatness)"
In my household we say fuck Chris Paul and his jersey tucking snitch ass. So he will fit right in.
"The idea of more Celtics championships does bore me. At least many of the Lakers are players I like, so not Celtics-Lakers.  Celtics-Warriors then? Nah, I'd be totally fine with seeing the Warriors do a comeback thing once finally the underdogs.  Celtics-Suns? I never disliked them before last season, but, that jackass Chris Paul had to go and back-smack both of PatBev's hands. I'll say it's that matchup."
"Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, Cade Cunningham, off the top of my head.     In other sports- Novak Djokovic, Alex Morgan.  You're about 5 years behind on the current exercise science."
New Orleans Chris Paul literally had one of the best guard peaks ever. AD wasn’t too far behind either with a KG like impact. Zion has a long way to go
Zion vs Chris Paul
"And he’d be one of the few guys able to exploit the midrange gaps and shoot “inefficient” midrangers on above average ts%, like Chris Paul."
Chris Paul - 3-6 weeks
Yeah I’d say peak CP3 is better.  Prime Stockton is a better version of current Chris Paul tho imo
"Most of them came from steals on post entry passes, dig downs in the post or tight quarters from limited floor spacing. Look at steal trends from the 1980 to now.  Back when bird played steak leaders often had solid amount over 3 steals per game. There hasn't been a player to average that many since Stockton. Chris Paul averaged 2.8 in new orleans. Since then the highest has been Chris Paul with 2.5 in 14-15.  The lowest average steaks per team in the 80s was 8.5. The league hasn't averaged 8 steals per game per team since the 1998/99 season. Its literally been over 20 seasons. Average steals have dropped by well over 1 per game. And mainly come from elite perimeter defenders or athletic help defenders like Covington or Draymond."
"Pelicans?  Chris Paul and AD are great, but Zion’s potential seems like something you don’t give up without an MVP-level player"
Paul Chris Hill George
Chris Paul George Hill
"I feel like the last 5 years the top 10 players in the league have been fairly static: LeBron, Durant, Curry, Kawhi, Harden, Giannis, AD, Jokic, Embiid and Luka (displacing Dame).  In 2021 (this year) Chris Paul came 5th. That doesn't mean he's a top 5 player.  In 2019 Paul George came 3rd. That doesn't mean he's a top 5 player.  In 2018 Lillard and Westbrook came 4th and 5th. They are still outside the top 10.  And 2017 was a farce. You have Westbrook winning it over Harden because of the triple double narrative, AND IT coming 5th."
"It's a toss up. I think in the modern game kidd has more potential. Reason being with a higher emphasis on shooting, kidd would have been a good shooter from the get go, or sooner than later.  Shooting, passing and defense would be an insane combo. Like chris paul. Nash would develop closer to a harden type player."
Prime Chris Paul is comparable or better than prime Stockton imo
"He averaged 15 at his peak,and he was a great 3 point shooter for his time.  If he were to play today he would probably average around 20 on good efficiency and elite defense. Prime Stockton is a better Chris Paul in today’s game.  Also I’d probably rather have Stock/Gobert than Malone/Gobert"
"During LeBron's first stint in Cleveland, there were a few players I would have attempted to traded for:  * Michael Redd  * Ray Allen   * Amaré Stoudemire  * Steve Nash  * Chris Paul"
"If we’re strictly talking from 96 above? Yes. But there are tiers to this.   Top tier: LeBron, Kobe, TD, Steph, KD, KG, Dirk, D Wade, Giannis.   Mid tier: AI, Kawhi, AD, JKidd, GP, Steve Nash, Chris Paul, Reggie Miller, Russ, Harden, Ray Allen, Paul Pierce  Low tier (Debatables) T-Mac, Bosh, TP, Pau, Klay, Melo, VC, Dame, Kyrie, Jokic   Outside of the 25 year window but have high chances to get in: Bob McAdoo  Debatables outside the 25 year window: Dominique, Dumars"
Its hard to to put him as 50 greatest ever if be cant even get in the top 10 sg of all time. He was a great players but was a tier lower and was in the chris bosh paul gasol level
"Remember when Andrew Bogut supplied one to the Bucks and that helped “seal the deal” for him as the #1 pick???  &gt; This tact especially impressed the then-governor of the Bucks, Herb Kohl. Bogut’s professionalism and snappy dressing blew away the U.S. Senator and businessman who started Kohl’s department store.  &gt; While he had seen players wear suits in draft interviews, Harris says the “resume thing” was something he’d never seen before. This “Corporate America strategy sealed the deal” for Bogut to the Bucks, and Paul fell to No. 4 and the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets.  https://www.sportscasting.com/chris-paul-almost-milwaukee-buck-until-andrew-bogut-shocked-nba-gms-at-draft-interview/"
The Thunder rivalry had a lot of mutual respect.  I never hated Adams or any of the other Thunder players.  Blake Griffin and Chris Paul on the other hand...
Chris Paul. Never gonna forget that untucked jersey call.
"looooooooooooooooooooooool, look at Chris Paul clip  CP3 shitting his pants instantly"
"CP3 I'd actually classify as the rare ceiling and non floor raiser.  Outside of the OKC year in 2020, you'd have to go back to 2011 to find a team in which he alone was capable of being the lead driving force of a team.  Hell even in OKC, they had Shai and Dennis to help CP3.  Gallo was awesome.  It wasn't Chris Paul carrying scrubs.  He's clearly more valuable as a player playing with other great players.  More so than someone like Russ who is best at leading mediocre teams to the playoffs like in 2017 because even when they got Paul George in 2018 the Thunder really weren't a better team."
Chris Paul too lol
It's funny though--do they even want him? When Doc goes out there and is not even concerned with protecting him--do they really want to hold onto him? Or are they just being reactionary because they don't want Chris Paul to get his way?
Chris Paul
"You can't really compare efficiency between players from almost 20 years apart, and 1 whose supporting cast was Mutombo and McKie vs the other whose supporting cast was Chris Paul, Eric Gordon (playing out of his mind), and Clint Capela."
Chris Paul carried he legit outplayed Steph in that series
"Idk what point you’re trying to make. Harden is the number 1 player on the team which means the other teams defense is mainly focusing on stopping him, which is completely different from Eric Gordon and Chris Paul."
"&gt;I think being up 3-2 on KD/Curry Warriors is just as, if not more, impressive than making the Finals in a historically weak conference.  From the Rockets 3 wins against the Warriors in 2018  Harden: 76 points on 25/71 FGs, 6/38 3 point shooting shooting with 11 assists and 12 turnovers  Chris Paul: 63 points on 22/53 FGs, 10/23 3 point shooting with 16 assists and 6 turnovers  Eric Gordon 65 points on 18/44 FGs, 10/27 3 point shooting with 4 assists and 1 turnover  It doesnt make sense to say any of these performances were better than iverson's carry job. His 2nd leading scorer was Aaron McKie. And reducing how impressive it is because it is the east doesn't make much sense. The sixers finished the season tied for the 2nd best record of anybody in either conference"
"From the Rockets 3 wins over the warriors in 2018  Harden: 76 points on 25/71 FGs, 6/38 3 point shooting shooting with 11 assists and 12 turnovers  Chris Paul: 63 points on 22/53 FGs, 10/23 3 point shooting with 16 assists and 6 turnovers  Eric Gordon 65 points on 18/44 FGs, 10/27 3 point shooting with 4 assists and 1 turnover  Are Chris Paul and Eric Gordon better than iverson too?"
Are you talking about Chris and Cliff Paul?
This was my first thought too but I also thought “there’s no way we can trade Chris Paul with that contract” and “Westbrook is untradeable with that deal” and look where we are now.
Chris Paul. He really did less for both okc and the suns than the media and /r/nba give credit for. I also blame him for book becoming a mega whiner.
"Chris Paul simply had a bad injury year and people over reacted. His game easily is not dependent on athleticism so you could see him being at least productive as he aged, they just gave up on him for a variety of dumb reasons.  But wall is entirely dependent on his athleticism, still has a shaky shot, still is inefficient, and you will see the 'magic' he had in few and far between flashes as he sat out for 2 entire years. I was surprised he even still looked reasonably athletic, but his game will not age well especialyl if you are dependign on a starter PG.  Worse off, he still will probably get injuredwhich then kills the 'hope' they are hoping to build by sitting him out that he can just get healthy and contribute something.  As Woj said, it aint happening unless they add assets which for their team is pointless bc this year they aren't doing anyhting or don't need a rush anyways.  If its about the owners saving money...aGain...then I feel bad for houstonians."
"Increased? How? Compared to what he was on the wizards, you think he’s even worse now?   He has stopped caring since the nuggets? You mean his 1st stint like 8 years ago? He has since completed his redemption arc as a player bro. He has 3 rings and a Olympic gold medal. Teams clearly view him as a good piece. He’s a good role player.   Javale himself says coaches and teams view him differently now. Chris Paul just recruited him to the suns, after playing against him and liking what he offers."
"Stockton, Chris Paul, KD and Giannis"
Chris Paul is undoubtedly the least likeable of them all by a very very large margin lol
"Lowry is a consistent scorer and one of the best playmakers in the league.  He’s definitely not a top 3 PG, but I’d say he has a claim to be around the same place as Chris Paul (I’m talking right now)"
"LMAO no he wasn't.   His best season was 2016, where he was All NBA 3rd team. Lowry in '16 was not better than: LeBron, Steph, Durant, Westbrook, Harden, Kawhi, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, DeMarcus Cousins or Anthony Davis, that's 10 right there and then you have guys like Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, LaMarcus Aldridge are all IMO better and then guys like Blake Griffin, DeRozan, Millsap, Marc Gasol, Karl Anthony Towns, Gordon Hayward were debatedly better.   Lowry at his peak was a top 20 player for sure, but top 10 is a huge stretch. ESPN had him at #18 following his 2016 All NBA season, Sport's Illustrated had him at #34, Washington Post at #14, Fadeaway World had him outside their top 20, CBS at #17. Lowry was never a consensus top 10 guy."
It’s just a rumor of course  NBPA were the ones who veto-ed it and Chris Paul was the President.  It is weird how the Exum signing went through but the Nene one didn’t
"As a Suns fan, Chris Paul. imo book is far and away the best player on our team"
Yeah I really don't understand how people don't even have him as a top 5 point guard. There wasn't a single thing he was bad at. Hell Chris Paul would need to play it 8 more years without dropping his career assist average to reach Stockton
I think trying to blame Chris Paul for that is a little ridiculous lol
Chris Paul
"I picked 2 players his height, I would add Embiid to that list, maybe even Towns. There are dozens of guards with more skill. Chris Paul, LeBron, Luka, Kawhi, Steph, Trae, Harden, Lillard, Paul George, Tatum, Devin Booker. If you gave these guys Giannis's body and athleticism, yet they could do the same things they do with their smaller bodies, they would be like those made up players in NBA 2K10. Imagine Chris Paul or Steph Curry at 7 foot with Giannis's speed and athleticism, lol. It wouldn't look real."
The funniest thing to me about this play is that Kobe created a worse matchup for Lin after the pick than before it.  If you're an athletic PG do you wanna try and drive on JJ Reddick or Chris Paul
"Accolades are circumstantial. Having more MVPs or whatever means shit. And advanced stats are flawed. If they were valid, Chris Paul would be pretty clear of some players you just named."
oh the advanced stats too. throw chris paul in there too!
"[CP3 and the Dubs have a petty battle](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/chris-paul-kicked-steph-curry-off-court-on-the-eve-of-game-6-and-now-hell-have-the-gym-to-himself-all-summer-long/#:~:text=When%20Stephen%20Curry%20made%20his,Kick%20him%20off!%22)"
Chris Paul unless he's playing your team then Melo
"Yeah, with Chris Paul it came down to age due to length or the deal and availability in the playoffs. His play style was never questioned. As for Wall the dude just looks washed and no one knows if he can last half a season. I can’t see a team touching him unless it’s like OKC and Boston where they just swap two players neither team wants."
"Fuck Dwayne Wade no shot he's more likeable than LeBron or CP3. I don't even like LeBron as a person and CP3 is dirty as hell but Dwayne Wade is unbelievably hateable  Here's what they could all potentially be hateable for:  Carmelo Anthony - ego, ""me? come off the bench?"", pushing Jeremy Lin out of New York, forcing D'Antoni out of New York.   Chris Paul - Dirty player, flopper, shit talker  Dwayne Wade - Dunk contest nonsense, mocking Dirk for being sick, flopper, defending Nick Cannon. Any Mavericks fan can list like 1000 more probably  LeBron - Mocking Dirk for being sick, China stuff, Klutch Sports, some people think he's full of himself"
If you’re talking to nba Reddit probably Chris paul. General public it’s wade
"He had Josh Smith as his 2nd option in 2015 against the Warriors which you asked about earlier. Dwight was on that team but was injured and declining. It’s weird how you build up Rockets Dwight and act like Miami Shaq was a role player.   And with Chris Paul he was up against the KD-Warriors (debatably the best team of all time) until CP3 went down with injury.   With Westbrook, Westbrook also got injured and got COVID. He then got traded and just snuck into the playoffs as the 8 seed.   And I never said Harden never had help, I just pointed out that Harden carried multiple teams to the playoffs every year regardless who was beside him. That isn’t true for Wade.  And the refs gave Wade what, 50 FTs in the final 2 games?"
"Never said Wade can win with Josh, second didn’t Harden have Westbrook, Chris Paul, and Howard? What happened there? You act like he never had help. He did and he just didn’t show up for most of the playoffs. Third Wade still did a large majority of the lifting in the 06 Finals."
All my homies hate Chris Paul
That last two sentences feel like those lines Morgan Freeman would read at the end of a movie with the a picture of Chris Paul and team celebrating in joy.
That last sentence is just pettiness but then again we talkin about king of petty Chris Paul lol
"I get what you're saying, but there are layers to it.  Streakiness can happen with a lot of different types of movements. It's why warmups are important to get reps in. Even just seeing the basketball go into the hoop can make a big difference.  Completing *a* pass isn't the same as making a good pass. Players often practice passing to specific spots. Like ball placement when a catch &amp; shoot player receives the ball in the corner can make or break a play. Too high or too low disrupts the flow and potential timing of the shot. For the passer, making a pass and it being right on the money can help future attempts because it acts as a reference point. Being off can do weird shit for athletes and over compensating can start to be a factor.  Someone like Chris Paul probably knows the specific ball placements all of his teammates work the best with in a given situation."
Chris Paul turned me into a newt!
"It makes a tiny bit of sense and a bunch of nonsense. Basketball is still a younger man's game. We see older players still playing at a higher level using their BBIQ like LeBron, Chris Paul and Iguodala but they're severely outnumbered by younger players who can jump out of the gym. It's not that hard to fill your team with 2 stars and a bunch older vets. But it rarely works. Which is why teams don't usually do it."
"What'd I say, I still blame Chris Paul"
I blame Chris Paul.  It probably wasn't him or mostly wasn't him but fuck Chris Paul.
"Yeah I mean RFAs and stars once they hit 30 are often a good source for this. Chris Paul 2018, Rudy Gobert 2020(not 30), Allen Crabbe 2016(we cant lose him for nothing!), John Wall 2017(him not aging super well even if he had bad luck wasnt hard to see), Tristian Thompson 2015, many LeBron role player free agents really, Nic Batum 2016(cant ruin our momentum from the previous yr)"
Harden aint built that way that’s why him and Chris Paul didnt last long.  He’s built for motorboating.
"pg - chris paul, sg - klay thompson, sf - kevin durant, pf - draymond green, c - deandre ayton"
Cause he nixed the chris paul trade
Chris Paul! Obviously…..
Just like Chris Paul?
"NOLA has been a poorly run franchise since the Chris Paul days, think that has more to do with it than location. Also, Atlanta has done pretty well with FA’s for a mid-size market team. Joe Johnson, Demarre Carrol, Bogdanovic, Paul Milsap in his prime, Dwight Howard, etc"
Idk Dragic could be a homeless man's Chris Paul next to Luka who's a middle class man's Harden
Monkey's Paw: The Phoenix Suns have traded Devin Booker and DeAndre Ayton for John Wall. The Suns will now be paying veteran guards Wall and Chris Paul a combined $75 million this coming season.
Harden wanted Chris Paul out and talked to Westbrook about teaming up.
"&gt;I mean if you believe ""advanced stats"" Chris Paul is probably a top 10 player of all time  Wdym?"
"Everyone talking about Chris Paul, but really Lebron earned it that year. That was the year he really established himself as the best player in the league imo"
"Chris Paul was deserving, but it’s not like Kobe wasn’t"
"I mean if you believe ""advanced stats"" Chris Paul is probably a top 10 player of all time  But in reality he's never even made to a conference finals as the #1 guy"
"I interpret this list as players who you feel obligated to pay because you don’t want to lose them for nothing, rather than players on obviously bad contracts like John Wall.  G: Ben Simmons G: Chris Paul F: Demar Derozan F: John Collins C: Jonas Valenciunas"
"Don't even bother, this happens every year where /r/NBA convinces themselves there's no way a player will be traded ""because their contract is so awful!"" and basically every time without fail they end up being traded.   Same thing with player options? ""No way Al Horford, Gordon Hayward, or Chris Paul decline their player options, nobody is gonna pay these guys!"" Lo and behold they all get paid anyways.   This place has the memory span of a goldfish."
Yeah IIRC the guy who actually hated Curry was Chris Paul
"Harden wasn't as good in that series as people remember. In the three games they won, he totaled 76 points, 11 assists, 17 rebounds and went 25/71 from the field and 6/38 from three. Eric Gordon and Chris Paul bailed him out repeatedly."
Ok Darryl you win. Chris Paul is amazing and he makes teams better. Let’s see him carry the Suns again lol With actual NBA squads that aren’t skeletons of themselves they wouldn’t have even got out of the first round. He missed his shot with all the stats in alignment.
"This is so off base at this point. Simple point I was making was that I don’t think Chris Paul makes any team better especially now. He has a notoriously shit attitude and plays bitch ball. He is an amazing athlete but he is a known bitch boy. It’s an opinion I don’t need you to share it, I am aware I can be wrong. Have a good one dude."
"One of two things.  1. Trade Westbrook (ideally for Chris Paul). This seems unlikely; however, the Suns may get cold feet about that contract they gave him and be happy to dump it on a shorter deal for Westbrook. 2. LeBron realizes that he's go to be the one playing off ball when Westbrook is on the court and letting Westbrook be Westbrook. People talked about how Westbrook would have to adjust his game: He can't. He's 33. He's not suddenly going to turn into a three point shooter. Nobody is going to guard him when he's off ball. Keep the ball in his hands; people WILL guard LeBron when he's off ball. It's not Westbrook who needs to adjust his game; it's LeBron who needs to adjust his."
"You'd get players like Chris Paul ruining it for everyone, calling fouls the instant he catches the ball."
lol I feel like you live in an alternate universe. Chris Paul was not hailed as a savior or the best player at any moment in his time in LA. They were still a laughing stock. The playoff runs were not on his back. He may have scored a few more points than griffin but he choked. Every. Single. Time.
"I didn’t say he was Gary Payton lol. Just that he’s a physical defender. There are many physical defenders in the league. There is also a subset of physical defenders who are known for being more aggressive.   Morris is one of them. Morris is a good player that any team would be happy to have for what he brings relative to his contract value. Patrick Beverly, Chris Paul, Delladolva, and Green are similar player types. Willing to push the rules and do a dirty play every once in a while."
He hasn't been good since Chris Paul left
I used to like the suns but then Chris Paul went there so
"As of right now the Wolves don't have an allstar. LeBron and AD will both make the allstar game, even if the Lakers are barely above .500, which will take away the possible frontcourt spot KAT could get. Guard is way too freaking deep for Edwards to make it, and as you can see from this breakdown, there will be an overflow of guards into the wildcard spots, making it so the bare mininum of 6 frontcourt players make it.   **Starters**  * Stephen Curry * Luka Doncic * LeBron James * Anthony Davis * Nikola Jokic  **Reserves**  * G - Donovan Mitchell * G - Chris Paul * F - Paul George * F - Draymond Green * F - Rudy Gobert * W - Devin Booker * W - Ja Morant"
Chris paul is overrated and still hasn't won shit. He has played with multiple all-stars and still couldn't get it done. I'll never understand why people are on his nuts so much.
Illinois and Deron also LIT UP Wake Forest and Chris Paul in the 04-05 season. One of my favorite basketball memories of all time.
"I don't think it's an unpopular opinion, but Chris Paul makes a team better, but he still needs help making a team the best. The question is, does anyone want to team up with him?"
"Most r/nba folks don't know, but there was a time when it was a legitimate opinion to think Deron Williams was better than Chris Paul."
"Midrange is actually pretty deadly for the few players who are REALLY good at it because it's basically unstoppable.  However, you need to be Chris Paul, KD, Dirk, MJ, Kawhi, etc.  Some of these guys actually drew decent amounts of fouls on midrange too (which is very hard to do on 3s.... even Harden doesn't get that many).  The other advantage is that midrangers can be a little more consistent (even if the ceiling is lower).  &amp;#x200B;  I think for the average guy though it's basically just useful to keep the defense honest."
People who just quote these impact stats as facts are hilarious  We all know Chris Paul has been better than LeBron since 2014 and Jokic is a better defensive player than Giannis  /s
Chris Paul had fucked up knees that took his athleticism away. D will was a all star but CP3 is an all timer and that is an example way
Isn’t Morey the guy who traded Chris Paul and two firsts for Westbrook just like two seasons ago lmao
I've linked some threads and discussion's on r/NBA ~10yrs ago when it was a legitimate debate. A little time capsule of the era.  [Article link](https://web.archive.org/web/20110907082656/http://getbuckets.fantake.com/2010/11/28/deron-williams-not-chris-paul-is-the-best-point-guard-in-the-nba/)  [Comment thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/edmcy/is_deron_williams_more_valuable_than_chris_paul)   [Another Discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/xif3y/chris_paul_vs_deron_williams_vs_derrick_rose_vs)
"Their position affords them so much potential value. Centers can be, and these two are, good rebounders, all world defenders, (in the case of embiid) efficient 28 ppg scorers. Dort just doesn't have the firepower to overcome that. It's like Dejounte Murray right now. Since his first three games he's averaging 21 points, 8 rebounds, and 8 assists. He's top 5 in assists per game. Nobody else in the top 20 assists per game besides Chris paul is averaging as few turnovers per assists. There's an argument that dejounte is the second best passer in the league stats wise, the best or second best rebounding guard, and he's 8th in steals per game while playing amazing all around defense. Despite all of that, nobody is going to call him a superstar. And they shouldn't. He just doesn't score the ball enough.  To recap: Dejounte Murray has an argument for being top 2-4 for every single base skill you'd want out of a point guard besides scoring. And on top of that he's almost averaging 20 a game on career high efficiency if you just remove the first 3 games he started ice cold. Yet he doesn't get called a superstar. Dort could and some people might say he definitely will be a better player than dejounte, but dejounte give you everything you want out of a guard and it's still not enough. I just don't see it for dort unless he has a complete change in his scoring profile/ability."
I mean Chris Paul also became less explosive around the same time Deron was turning into a superstar. When he had his first big injuries. Once Deron was his best self and was 100% healthy I would say they were on par for a bit and people started hyping up Deron because his game was fun to watch and he was really good. It was a debate but not for long enough that it even matters when evaluating their careers.
"My favourite D-Will memory was the 08 Olympics when Chris Paul apparently dunked it in one of the exhibition/training matches, and Deron tried to go for the jam every time he got to the rim.  Think he got one down eventually, but shit was funny."
"Isn't it usually the opposite? Guys that rely too much on athleticism breakdown as they get older because their bodies can't do it but the ones that rely on IQ and playmaking play forever like Chris Paul, Stockton, Kidd, etc."
"2009? The year that Chris Paul was getting 1st place MVP votes, made an all NBA team and all star while Deron accomplished none of those things, and led the Hornets to a better record than the Jazz?"
We were beating y'all a majority of the game with our best player and probably 2nd best defender out. Also Luka is now somehow a ball hog lmao! Chris Paul said Luka was his favorite player to watch. Suns will be irrelevant when hes gone like they were for the last few decades.
"Chris Paul. I used to kinda like him but the more I watch, the more I think he's a little bitch."
"Three of your examples, PG, AD, and KD, were all part of trades where the  receiving team had to give things up to get them.   Chris Paul was also pretty open about wanting a trade to Milwaukee to play with Giannis. Your front office chose not to make a deal for him. So don’t cry about never being able to get star players when it’s pretty clear a bunch of guys would love to play with Giannis."
I like Chris Paul but I don’t know if I agree that he makes every team better… The Clippers for instance…
"Giannis could do it this year, so he's a lot closer than most.  Booker, the Suns are going really well at the moment. A lot would depend on how they replace Chris Paul.  Donovan Mitchell. Jazz look like they'll be a high seed in the playoffs again this year.  Trae Young. Hawks haven't started too well but they're young, and they've got good depth, so they should be there or there abouts for the next few years."
Deron averaged 10 assists in his prime. He wasn't really just a scoring pg. He was really neck and neck there with Chris Paul before he declined.
this is 100%  he was never better than cp. he had one cp3 level year while chris was coming off knee surgery. and everyone went nuts  then he immediately returned to his level and cp3 returned to his.   he was never ever as good as chris paul. but for about a year or so he was fairly close
Chris Paul got hurt in 2009 and still put up virtually the same numbers while playing better defense and turning the ball over less.      He was still a better player.
"People talk about it all the time, but even at the time that was a ridiculous argument. Chris Paul was always clearly better."
"https://theanalyst.com/eu/2021/10/nba-stats-and-player-projections/  Top 10 in DRIP (excluding Kawhi)  1. Steph - +6.6  2. Jokic - +5.7 (Kawhi is tied)  T-3. LeBron - +5.1  T-3. CP3 - +5.1  5. KD - +5.0  6. Giannis - +4.9  7. Embiid - +4.7  8. Harden - +4.6  9. PG - +4.4  10. Jimmy - +4.0  Interesting as I feel like this tracks with most people's Top 10 (11 with Kawhi), with 2 notable exceptions, DRIP is considerably higher on Chris Paul and Paul George than the public (two guys who coincidentally faced off in last year's Conference Finals), and considerably lower on Luka Doncic and Anthony Davis."
"How the fuck was he defending himself by pushing someone in the back? Morris fouled him, it got called and he got a flagrant one and it was over. How is putting your entire body weight into someone's back as they walk away defending yourself. I'd be interested to go back in time and see what you said about the pat bev/Chris Paul push as well."
He stopped playing with Chris Paul
You really discredit your entire post and your basketball knowledge when you omitted Chris Paul who is literally one of the best passer to ever lace them up and put a second year player on.

Chris Paul is Fkin me up in fantasy goddam
In terms of pure passing I would go: Chris Paul Trae Young Ricky Rubio Nikola Jokic Josh Giddey - I know heaps biased but in terms of pure passing I genuinely reckon the man is very much up there. Watch some thunder games if U disagree.

"Loving Chris Paul is a great thing, until the post-season happens, please dear lord let this year be different"
he does actually le commish vetoed the chris paul trade to keep the lakers from ever winning a real ring
Chris Paul won ROY.
Would Phoenix rather have Chris Paul + Devin Booker or Kevin Johnson + Dan Majerle?
"He stopped playing with Chris Paul, who was the only reason his career was relevant."

Chris Paul loves to run behind the backs of bigs in semi transition to create area where he can suddenly pull up for 3
Chris Paul look fat
Chris Paul has stayed healthy in Phoenix
Chris Paul leaned in.
Chris Paul came straight out the womb shooting that mid-ranger fading to his right  I don’t think I’ve ever seen him miss it
"Chris Paul  Jokic  Trey  LaMelo  Ricky  Some guys get more assists, but it’s because they are studs and often pass to wide open teammates off a double team."
No Chris Paul and none of the comments even mentioning Draymond?  The disrespect lol
how is chris paul not on the list? it’s not like he gets worse at passing over time if anything the experience just means he knows when to utilize simpler passes and when not to
HELLO POLICE ITS BLAKE GRIFFIN FIVE FOOT TEN CHRIS PAUL TRYINA BEAT ME UP YO POLICE IM SCARED IM SIX TEN NBA SUPERSTAR
Whenever I hear rose I just think of the Chris Paul police presence incident hahah
chris paul is leading the league in assists right now with like a 5:1 ast/to ratio lmao
Chris Paul is wildly underrated
1. Skip Bayless 2. Shaq 3. Phil Jackson 4. Oscar Robinson 5. Stephen A Smith 6. Scott Foster 7. Stan Van Gundy 8. James Harden 9. Kevin Durant 10. Kevin McHale 11. Stephen A Smith 12. Shaq 13. Mychal Thompson 14. Twitter 15. Chris Paul
"Explain how Im not. Kobe not having any seasons in the top 250 is a big deal and indicative of something bad, but Chris Paul being top 5 wont change anyones mind. Dantley is 33rd all time. Kobe is 61st. How many people do you know that are arguing that he's better? Why does this matter to some degree, but only to the degree that makes your point?"
"He’s just fucking huge so when he pushes back dudes get bent. If you tracked every NBA player literally almost all of them do that on some % of plays, the difference is that when Chris Paul or even Morris (in this case) does it you have to watch the replay to notice, when Jokic or Embiid does it the guy on the other end ends up curled up on the ground. That’s because of the size difference as much as anything- I’m not saying Jokic doesn’t get frustrated but it’s not necessarily more than other guys, the impact is just more obvious"
"It sounds like you don't like stats that disagree with your personal feelings.  As I said, it's just one tool - like any other metric it's not perfect.  There will always be a few guys with weird results, outliers, etc.... even RAPM has those issues.  Maybe instead of dismissing it you might want to think about why it ranks Hakeem that low for example.  Hakeem actually wasn't that great on offense for much of his career - a little above average efficiency as a scorer and not the best passer.  You shouldn't focus too much on the rankings either.  Like some of these guys are really close together score wise even if their ranks are pretty far apart.  &amp;#x200B;  I mean OBPM tells me that Kobe is in the ""3rd tier"" of offensive greats along with guys like Shaq, Bird, etc.  2nd tier guys are your Curry, Magic, etc.  Then you have Lebron and of course MJ (who almost deserves his own tier for the postseason - but that's another topic).  &amp;#x200B;  I mean doesn't that seem about right?  Keep in mind he'll have other advantages over a lot of these guys.  Like Chris Paul is somewhere around that tier, but Kobe will be ranked higher because he has more accolades and post season success.  Obviously there's other metrics to look at also."
Is Chris Paul top 5 all time
"&gt;I more look at it as a good tool to tier guys  It's a terrible tool to tier guys. Career OBPM puts Hakeem outside the top 100 (OBPM = 2.17), way under guys like Westbrook and Kevin Love (OBPM ≈ 4). It puts Duncan outside the top 40 (OBPM = 3.29), way below guys like Chris Paul and Kyrie (OBPM ≈ 5).  Career OBPM is a useless stat. Bringing up the fact that it ranks Kobe 20th is literally meaningless."
"OBPM is a box-score derived stat. Is Damian Lillard a better offensive player than Bird? Is Barkey a better offensive player than Chris Paul? Barkley &gt; Shaq? If you believe everything that this stat entails then I cant argue with you because then atleast youre consistent, but if you dont then you're just picking and choosing. Kobe is better than Dirk in essentially every aspect of the game minus of course shooting and rebounding."
"Yes, win shares. I'd hope you have Chris Paul in your top 5 since his career WS/48 is there."
"To be clear - I'm no Kobe hater (unless people do ridiculous things like pretend he's MJ/Lebron level)... and I do think the ""inefficient"" stuff is WAY overplayed and not true.  However, numbers don't like.  The guy is great, but he's a notch below the super elite offensive guys.  Look at career OBPM:  &amp;#x200B;  1.	Michael Jordan\*	7.17   2.	LeBron James	7.05   3.	Stephen Curry	6.23   4.	Kevin Durant	6.03   5.	James Harden	5.95   6.	Magic Johnson\*	5.93   7.	Damian Lillard	5.48   8.	Charles Barkley\*	5.35   9.	Chris Paul	5.18   10.	Larry Bird\*	5.12   11.	John Stockton\*	4.90   12.	Kyrie Irving	4.83   13.	Tracy McGrady\*	4.69   14.	Julius Erving\*	4.64   15.	Anthony Davis	4.64   16.	Kobe Bryant\*	4.62   17.	Kawhi Leonard	4.55   18.	Shaquille O'Neal\*	4.43   19.	David Robinson\*	4.43   20.	Steve Nash\*	4.35  &amp;#x200B;  And playoff OBPM:  1.	Michael Jordan\*	8.81   2.	LeBron James	7.62   3.	Nikola Jokić	7.45   4.	Kevin Durant	6.44   5.	Stephen Curry	6.37   6.	Tracy McGrady\*	6.17   7.	Magic Johnson\*	6.08   8.	Charles Barkley\*	5.42   9.	Larry Bird\*	5.40   10.	Kawhi Leonard	5.35   11.	Julius Erving\*	5.33   12.	James Harden	5.26   13.	Giannis Antetokounmpo	5.23   14.	Chris Paul	5.23   15.	Dirk Nowitzki	5.19   16.	Damian Lillard	5.14   17.	Shaquille O'Neal\*	5.04   18.	Reggie Miller\*	5.03   19.	Kobe Bryant\*	4.98   20.	Allen Iverson\*	4.85  &amp;#x200B;  Now, this is offense only - and first threepeat Kobe was a good defensive player (he was pretty average to below average in the 2nd part of his career... but not so much that it stopped the team from winning)  I also think Kobe's playmaking is underrated.   He was similar to MJ in that regard where people just think about the scoring, but forget the assists combined with the excellent turnover economy (very key in Phil's system).  Kobe also won - even if we say Shaq was the man for the first 3 he was still the best player on back to back title teams... which is more than some of the guys on the list above him can say.  So he gets credit for that.  I really do think 8-15 is totally fair... and I do think guys like Steph and probably KD are going to end up ahead of him.  I mean is Kobe really that much better than Dirk?  He won more... but other than that I'm not sure.... and I'd probably put them around the same tier."
"Let’s goo no order  Lebron, KD, Kawhi, Barkley, Bird, Scottie, Elgin, Pierce, Melo, Dominique, Rick Barry, Worthy, Grant Hill, Paul George, Tracy McGrady, Dr. J, Havlicek, Alex English, Dantley, Bernard King, David Thomson, Billy Cunningham, Paul Arizin, Shawn Marion, Chris Mullin, Jamaal Wilkes, Mark Aguire, Luka, Derozan, Jimmy Butler, Iguadola  That’s 30 better than him"
A push in the back could of ended up with morris being completely fine aswell. Pat bev did the same to chris paul and got a 1 game suspension aswell
Prime Jordan. Just left the defender way behind for those lobs. Once Chris Paul left though…
"But that's my point, the talent was present. Even if the team didn't win games or got far in the playoffs. Garnett is arguably the most talented PF that ever played the game, imo his MVP season is more impressive than Duncan, Malone, Dirk, Barkley, etc.. you name it, the raw talent was there, but the guy couldn't go far. But that's the thing, how many basketball fans could witness a alltime talent like KG? Not many. The Hornets franchise is another example, Chris Paul is arguably the most talented pure PG ever, but he couldn't win, etc.. At least you have nice highlights, that's better than nothing. Also the Wolves is a young franchise, with time maybe they can find their way. Look at the Grizzlies, similar ""age"" and only nowadays they finally drafted a very good talent on Ja Morant, it takes time"
Chris Paul leads the league in assists and his team has the second best record.
"You were a little trigger happy to jump to that conclusion weren't you?   I'm gonna copy a comment replying to one of the 8 other guys with the same problems with my comment that you do, /u/anactualfuckingnazi.  &gt; I am saying that the conversation about hollywood transformation, when it's been white guys like Chris Pratt, Rob McElHenney, Paul Rudd even, has been all about ""strict discipline"" ""funded workout trainers and chefs"" ""strict diet"" ""i can't eat any junk food anymore"". That's what gets talked about in media interviews, on social media, etc etc. And if you're going to make the claim that ""nuh-uh, the steroid talk has been pervasive,"" it absolutely has not been as pervasive (with the aforementioned actors) as it's been with Kumail after his transformation. Like, that's a straight-up lie to assume that.  &gt; The conversation changed when the brown guy did it. That's the point."
"You're missing a little bit of nuance here. I'm not saying it's racist to assume he's roiding because he's brown, that's a huge jump to conclusion.

Just looked at the list for this year. The people shooting this percentage with any kind of volume whatsoever are:  1. Kevin Durant  2. Chris Paul  End of list
I love how NBA players think they are actually intelligent or something  Chris Paul is the leader of the players union so he thinks he is the smartest guy in the NBA.  Being the smartest player in the NBA is like being the tallest dwarf

“Hello Police? Chris Paul trying to beat me up”
"&gt; I don't think there was ever a time when Drummond was good enough to be playing 30+ MPG and averaging 16 PPG on a great team.  This is definitely an interesting point. If he had Chris Paul and Klay Thompson on his team in his prime, could Drummond have been a legit impactful star? Good chance imo. But yeah when you consider what he actually was, he was a good box score guy who wasn’t great on defense and was limited offensively."
"We sure Chris Paul doesn't deserve to be on this list? I'd prob rather have Van Vleet than Siakam if I were them as well, dude is massively underrated. Idk if DeRozan is on the list given how Morey's a big analytics guy (not saying I wouldn't take him but just saying). If CJ was one of the 30 I feel like the trade would've happened by now probably, not disputing that he'd be a great fit for them though"
"Really?! Chris Paul lead a team by himself to the finals? Chris Paul has always had other stars around him. And if you’re going Any guard next how would it not be Nash, Stockton, then Tony Parker before Chris Paul. Same type players that have won it all."
"&gt; A lot of fans incapable of more complex thinking believe that whatever happened is the only thing that could’ve happened  Nobody thinks that. Obviously anything can happen, but speculating on what could have happened if \_\_\_\_ had happened is pointless.   If Draymond didn't get suspended in the Finals we probably would have won in 2016.  If Chris Paul didn't get injured we probably would have lost the WCF in 2018.  Can KD win without Curry? Of course he can. *Has* he? No."
But do they still feel the need to go all-in and get Chris Paul if KD isn't on the Warriors?

all of our bigs aside from AD were unplayable agains the suns not just ayton.   we had no perimeter d and couldn’t contain book and then cam payne and chris paul killed our bigs with that high PnR
Black don’t crack my ass. How does Ayton look older than Chris Paul?
"In many cases, teams should give into trade demands and they eventually do. I went through trade demands with Anthony Davis, Chris Paul and Eric Gordon.      Anthony Davis, it made sense to wait because Lakers needed him to capture Lebron's window, more than we needed AD for our short-term goals. We paid a culture and performance price that year while we waited it out. Not sure waiting led to any net benefits.   We didn't acquiesce on Gordon and he stayed, underperformed and impacted our culture for years.     When a player's done, it's best to move on. Just like when a team is done with a player, it moves on. Ben doesn't want to play for sixers organization, Joel and their fans. If it was just organizationally, that could be fixed by him coming and playing."
Chris Paul &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jimmy Butler
Shaq or Chris Paul. Who would you rather have
"I like how Giannis played the final 3 minutes of the game with his jersey untucked. you know if Chris Paul were out there, he would've made sure that man's jersey was properly tucked."
"look, this sub hates him, but Ben Simmons would be a better return than the hauls from these trades:   1.	Boogie  2.	Paul George 3.	Kyrie 4.	Chris Paul to LAC 5.	Harden to Houston 6.	Kevin Love 7.	Blake Griffin   he’s a 3 time all star, an all-nba talent, and he’s a top 3 best defender in the league   NBA teams always think they can coach guys up and get them right and whatnot. i guarantee there’s a coach and FO who thinks they will fix him and his value will be higher than most other options   like the Cavs keep getting mentioned in these trades and i know they can’t be offering more than like Sexton and some firsts. that would be so much worse than Simmons for every other potential star, but that’s what the other teams have   simmons won’t get moved for a nobody"
"Nah Morey was regularly taking extreme advantage of tiny loopholes in the CBA to get you new players/get under the tax without hurting the team. Hell he basically magically got Chris Paul on the team for like two rotation players, a pick, and some tax cheat codes.  He also picked a phenomenal coach, and worked with him to create a entirely new offensive system that everyone on the sub complained “solved the game”.  He also accomplished, you know, the best trade in Basketball history.  During the Warriors era, he was regularly finding players that were severely underrated that he stitched together into a team that was of near equivalent quality as the best team in history. (PJ Tucker, Capela, Gordon, Trevor Ariza, Austin Rivers, etc).  He’s easily a top three GM in the game right now"
"Sure. But do they affect all star selections ? No.   And when did those players make all star undeservedly ? Jimmy has deserved it every year he’s made it. He’s even missed it a few times when he should’ve made it. Same with Chris Paul. Kobe was a fan vote, again fans don’t vote for benches anymore. Melo and Wade ? These ones are the most debatable but who deserved it over them ? They both were at least borderline all stars every year they made it and the east was fairly weak"
"You know what they say about assumptions.   I watched suns games frequently last year, because they were my second favourite team and Chris Paul is my favourite point guard. When your point hinges on you making assumptions about things you have no way of knowing, it’s a stupid point. Granted I’ve only watched 2 suns games this year since now I have to rely on league pass.  Last year there were like 5 player “snubs”. Bam, Derozan, Shai, Trae Young, etc. The league is full of talent. It’s easy to say someone’s a snub, it’s significantly harder to say they deserve it over someone else.  He is playing worse than he was last year so far. Not by a huge gap but he’s less productive, both as is and by possession, and he’s less efficient, both as is and relative to the league average. Those are both facts. In the two games I watched his defence looked a bit better I guess. I already addressed the point about harden and dame, and Davis is playing better than last year, his stats are slightly skewed by the game where he got injured instantly which plays a large role in a 16 game sample. And again, these players are generally MVP level players. Assuming they get back to their usual level, they’re all star locks. Book isn’t on that level. He’s on the mitchell - Beal- Lavine level where plenty of players are bidding for those last spots"
Last years playoff run means absolutely nothing.   Your other points are fair but Ja has been absolutely absurd this season. He’s 100% deserving and unless he tapers off a whole bunch he’s likely a lock. He’ll make it over at least one of the suns back court guys and I think the coaches will favour Chris Paul
Usually go to heavy Chris Paul play when we are trying to run the clock
Chris Paul licking his lips
Chris Paul is an asshole who makes people around him better basketball players. James Harden is an asshole who nearly ruined basketball. Easy choice.
At the game right now. Chris Paul talks a lot lol
"Chris Paul hadn’t been in the Playoffs til last year?   Damn what a legend, his first playoff run and he led the team to the Finals. Truly a point god"
"Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Chris Paul hadn’t been in the playoffs until last year."
&gt;Then why do opposing offenses target him on defense?  Because their other option is Chris Paul. Opposing offenses are pretty much always going to target a guard.
"Chris Paul is almost the same size so it's not like you cannot contribute. Iverson was not that great, but I have a feeling like he'd probably not be called bad in current NBA culture."
Paul Pierce and Chris Paul
Chris Paul
Fuck Chris Paul till I die
"The fact that you think it's impossible for someone else to ""know"" as much as you about the Suns is pretty damn telling of how *extremely* biased you are. Chris Paul is a better player than chucker Booker. Defense is a thing. I know you Suns fans are used to just chucking in 7SOL so it's not surprising something this obvious flies over your head. Blind homer."
Chris Paul gets hate???
Chris Paul is such a great leader for the Phoenix Suns. Every NBA team would benefit from a Chris paul on their team.
All I'm saying is there are PGs with rings that contributed to winning that people don't consider better then Chris Paul.
"I'm not reading all of that but wilt played milkmen and tv-repairmen and still barely won anything. He's not better than Shaq, Kobe, TD, etc.  &amp;#x200B;  Also Larry Bird is weirdly low and Chris Paul is weirdly high"
Chris Paul
people consider chris paul a top 5 PG having won...?
"Technically, a lot of the NBA dream team members hated Isaiah Thomas such as Magic, Larry, Scottie just to name a few.  It wasn't just Michael who didn't want him on the original Dream Team. But, I agree with the rest of your post with the exception of not hating Chris Paul.  Ben Simmons is a little bitch."
"??? why?      He's just missing longevity and to win as his career goes on. His numbers are there. His peak is there. He's got a ring. He's a better defensive player than Jordan and Lebron and he's still seemingly evolving. It's not like a small feat or even a likely one, but if Giannis starts stacking chips and ends up in the 4-6 range he's going to have a very strong argument at the top of the leaderboard. He isn't there right now, but in a perfect scenario it isn't unattainable.  It isn't like somebody like Chris Paul who even if he won back to back rings he isn't in that conversation. He's at or beyond where Lebron and Jordan were at the same age. I've got Lebron #1 and Jordan #2. A lot of other people have it the other way around, regardless of which criteria you favor though Giannis could feasibly insert himself into that discussion."
1. Frank Kaminsky 2. Devin Booker  3. Chris Paul 4. Deandre Ayton 5. Mikal Bridges  6. Cam Johnson 7. Cam Payne 8. Jae Crowder 9. Javale McGee 10. Landry Shamet
"Lebron can’t do what Curry can do and Curry can’t do what Lebron can do.  In lebrons peak has had to guard the best player on the opposing team (multiple positions), be the best rebounder, develop a post game. He will never be as efficient as Curry.  Curry will never be the type of defender Lebron is. And even if it’s physical, Chris Paul is like 3-5 inches shorter and was/is a better defender than Curry through their careers."
Chris Paul
"It’s odd that our team’s passing has been just fine since we moved on from a guy averaging double digit assists. I wonder if the same could be said for a team moving on from Chris Paul, Harden, Luka, or Trae"
Chris Paul
1. Lebron 2. Westbrick 3. Chris Paul 4. Harden
"Not only are they undersized, they're bad at defense.  FVV, Chris Paul, and Kyle Lowry are all undersized and are still excellent defenders."
I personally think Paul Pierce is a good cut-off. PP and anyone who had a better career than him can get in.  I don’t think there’s been that many undeserving guys. Chris Bosh comes to mind as someone I wouldn’t have admitted
Chris Paul   Harden  Don’t have one (would be KD but Warriors)  Dirk  Hakeem
"He has always been exactly this good, he just doesn’t have prime Chris Paul and prime Blake griffin pulling 4 defenders from the rim anymore."
Chris Paul hasn’t been the best player both years he’s been here. Booker is definitely the better player -someone who watched almost every suns game last year and every suns game so far this year
"Yeah you know. WC champs, second seed in the nba currently and last season? Chris Paul, Devin Booker? I’m sure you’ve heard of them"
"Being a scorer and a floor general are not mutually exclusive. A scorer is not just a kind of player, it is a role; one that can be shared with other roles to be carried out by a singular player.  Someone like Chris Paul is a good example of exactly the kind of player you are thinking of, not LeBron.  For comparison:  CP3 averages 13.6 FGA and 9.4 Assists for his career.  LeBron averages 19.5 FGA and 7.4 Assists for his career.  LeBron for his career, shoots the ball nearly 3 times as many times as he assists on a successful shot. CP3 can score, but he cannot do it in high volume like LeBron can. LeBron can and does so, thus he is a scorer.  CP3’s job is to run the offense and set up guys, while scoring here and there. LeBron’s job is to also set up his teammates, but half the time he is running his offense, he is also looking to score.  You can’t average 19.5 FGA and 27 PPG for your 19 year career without prioritising your scoring when you run the team’s offense.  For comparison, Kevin Durant, who is known first and foremost as a scorer, averages 18.6 FGA for his career.  Kobe Bryant, who is infamously known as a chucker, averaged 19.5 FGA for his career. The same amount as LeBron James. Even excluding Kobe’s rookie year, he averaged 20.2 FGA for his career, only 0.7 more than LeBron.  So how is it that KD and Kobe, who average 18.6 FGA and 19.5 FGA respectively, are scorers, but LeBron who shoots the ball more than KD and averages the same 19.5 FGA for his career as Kobe, is “not a scorer”?  It just simply sounds silly to not call LeBron a scorer. Just because LeBron runs the offense and is the primary playmaker of his team does not mean he’s a scorer.  If you can’t understand something as simple as a player holding multiple roles and abilities that even a child can understand, then I sadly can’t help."
"Nba players don't get inducted ""as teams"" but the obvious ones for players who were great w. multiple teams are Ray Allen, Kevin Garnett, Charles Barkley, Chris Paul"
"I’d like to go back to this point. I heavily disagree. Being a scorer and a floor general are not mutually exclusive.

"See my comment on u/htxthr ‘s comment. Chris Paul isn’t the best player on the suns. I REPEAT, CHRIS PAUL ISNT THE BEST PLAYER ON THE SUNS"
Chris Paul didn't 'change' anything. He complimented what they were already doing. This is a shit narrative.
"Yed, they have Chris Paul who changed the sins immediately after he arrived but that always gets overlooked"
"Bruh CHRIS PAUL ISNT THE BEST PLAYER ON THE SUNS!!! D book has been better than him this season and last, and yet you still want Chris pull in the mvp race? I have watched every suns game this season, and I can tell you with confidence that cp3 has not been better than book. Other than the first 5/6 games when book was still recovering from COVID, Devin has been the best player on the suns."
"I mean, the Hawks have played more games this season so far. Trae has 512 points in 20 games and Curry has 511 points in 18 games. If you look at PPG Curry is fairly ahead in points. Same with the Chris Paul example. I get your point though."
I’d probably just replace Trae Young with Chris Paul and maybe flip Giannis/Jokic but your list is good

"naw david atern coulda let us have chris paul. lmao.  lol the ""beacuase they're right about that one""   wait why are the laker girls creepy?  everything else. totally fatually true about alot of our fans unfortunately"
"It wasn’t an elbow, it was a closed fist. Obviously didn’t mean to smoke him in the face like that but if you close your fist and swing that hard can you really claim it was an accident? Obviously he was trying to hit something, just happened to connect right in the face. No chance for criminal charges though come on lol at most he would have gotten one swing in before it would have been broken up. Rondo punched Chris Paul a couple years ago and the repercussions were pretty weak imo"
 Chris Paul filled with angst and burning rage in the style of early 00s music video
DeAndre owes like half his salary to Chris Paul and doc rivers. Man has not looked like an NBA player outside of the clippers
"Stiff competition with Steph this year for first team, but Trae can make 2nd team. He's definitely the best PG in the east right now. His competition is basically Dame and Luka, and both of those guys have gotten off to slow starts by their usual standards. Trae meanwhile is having a career year. Also you have to mention Chris Paul.   Since he's the leader and face of the Hawks it'll ultimately depend on how the Hawks finish the year though. If they're a high seed and he's still playing like this, it should be a sure thing unless Dame or Luka just go circus mode the rest of the year (entirely possible)."
Devin Booker played in 0 playoff games before Chris Paul showed up.
Chris Paul is still going.
"Yup. I've made my peace with the fact that this group of players is not going to accomplish the things that I hoped they would and that this era is going to be over a lot sooner than I had hoped. Which is crazy to think about it since it's just a little bit more than a year since the Bubble where we were 2 games away from the NBA Finals.   I was optimistic things might be different this year with Ime... but nah more of the same.   I don't think there's anything we can do really, Ainge screwed us his last 2 years as GM, every move since Kyrie left has been a bad move, and now he's left Brad in charge of his mess.   If I could pick Danny's brain, I would ask him what he was thinking when he decided to pass on pursuing Chris Paul in 2 separate offseasons in 2019 and 2020, and why he thought Kemba Walker was a better fit. IMO one of the dumbest decisions ever, one guy is The Point God, the other guy was a fringe All-Star that put up stats on bad teams."
"Dwight was dominant for a long time.  Just on a shit team.  Kind of like Chris Paul, but then Chris Paul went to better teams and was still dominant.  Dwight joined the Lakers and became a joke, and that's probably why he was omitted."
"Why is Chris Paul trying to draw cheap fouls when he’s up by 20? Jesus Christ, that shit’s insufferable."
Why compare 30 year old Nash with 36 year old Chris Paul
No you were dude you said 2013 Nash was not far statistically from last year's Chris Paul. Technically true but not representative of on the court performance imo
If you replace Nash with Chris Paul for the 2020-2021 Suns are they better or worse on offense?
"I agree, Chris Paul made a big difference to The Suns offense. How is that relevant to your initial statement haha.  Both were great point guards, Paul still is."
"Ummmm I appreciate the sarcasm, but your initial comment, which this whole discussion is in response to, was that Chris Paul LAST YEAR was light years ahead of Nash.... so that's what we compared.  I'm confused why you're now trying to be sarcastic when you made the comparison..."
"Here's my measure of ""better on offense""   Suns Offensive Rating in 2020: 16th  Suns Offensive Rating in 2021: 2nd  Difference? Chris Emmanuel Paul"
"Yes, I will concede 32 year old Steve Nash is as good as 36 year old Chris Paul"
Everyone thought that contract was horrible before Chris Paul had a resurgence in OKC  That’s literally the reason he was traded
Chris Paul last year was lightyears ahead of Steve Nash in 2012
"How dumb you've gotta be to do that to CP3? Watch some tape, dude. Don't hand check Chris Paul. That easy."
"Welcome to the NBA Quentin Grimes, here’s Chris Paul have fun"
"Not sure you can trust defensive RAPTOR when it’s got Chris Paul at 200, Jakob Poeltl at 222, and OG Anunoby at 227. Last year with a much bigger data set JV ranked 7th of 86 centers in DRPM, and although DRPM is flawed too, he was a 0.0 in on/off def ratg. He’s not a bad defender any more. Not good, but not bad."
"This is so stupid.   The point is they were always in the upper echelon of teams.   This is like saying no team could ever win a championship with Chris Paul.   Did they win? No. Could they have? Yes lmao, there’s so much luck that goes into every championship run and it went against them almost every single time."
"I’m not even a Clippers fan I’m a Chris Paul fan lol  And I never said disliking players is a problem, but obviously nuance isn’t your thing. Have a great day"
Chris Paul
1 Chris Paul  1 Michael Jordan  1 Kevin Durant  1 Karl Malone  1 Shaquille O Neal
"Spurs with DeRozan  Raptors with Lowry  Jrue Holiday and Pelicans  Marc Gasol and the Grizzles  Chris Paul on the Thunder  There’s definitely a few, most of these all parties, player, organisation and fans all wished the best and thanked eachother…"
"Chris Paul is someone that always had me thinking he made the absolute most out of his physical traits. Sometimes he'll make an incredible dribble move with super smooth footwork to just barely shoot over a guy.  He was quick as lightning in his NOLA days but we never got to see that speed combined with more experience, can't help but think how terrifying he would be if we saw an apex Paul with his early speed + size of a regular guard."
"I don't know what magic pills Chris Paul took that summer, he honestly looked so bad that last year with the Rockets, especially in the playoffs. Just couldn't do anything on offense or defense."
"If Ariza just went 4-12 from the field, instead of 0-12  Rockets have a championship and CP3/Harden/Morey/MDA are still in Houston.  Why did Chris Paul have to take that awkward floater and get hurt in game 5????"
But like that Chris Paul move was still ice cold tho lol
Chris Paul and Jrue for New Orleans.

"Oh, a 36 year old CP3 beating the Warriors in 7 to return to the finals would be the last scene of the Chris Paul biopic"
It includes all the regular season games. Chris Paul has a lot of practice at losing to Steph.
"Totals is a shit measure of longevity objectively, no matter how you define longevity, which is the ONLY ambiguous and subjective part as it encompasses years, durability, career consistency, and actual performance as a scorer scored within basketball games. And it's still shit for all of them. Context is the most important thing behind any statistic, and totals lacks any context behind those variables that underpin it, and that is the root of its problem in trying to measure anything. You have no idea where the points are coming from, how much is attributed to each variable, only that these players have accumulated these points, under vastly different circumstances, career trajectories etc.  * if you weighed injury resistance heavily as longevity you have players who struggle to stay on the court (Chris Paul no.45) outperforming players who are ironmen (John Stockton no.49).   * If you weigh years played heavily as longevity you have players (Bob Petit no.40) outperforming players who played half the years of others (Scottie Pippen no.62)  * If you weigh consistent performance over a long period of time heavily you still have no way of discerning from totals whether someone was a truly great scorer for a long time (James Harden no.32) or was simply an above-average scorer who played forever (Ray Allen no.24). Also see Kevin Durant vs almost everyone above him.  * It doesn't tell you anything about career consistency. Eg. over 80% of Wilts points were accumulated before he hit 30 (over 9 seasons), he averaged 18ppg in his remaining seasons 30 - 36. yet he's 7th in all time scoring purely because he averaged almost 40ppg over 9 seasons. Meanwhile Dirk who is right next to him maintained a consistent level of performance over a long period of time.  And the result of this shitshow is so easily demonstrated by removing player names and comparing stats, example:   * Player A - 19711 points total (no.49). Player B - 18713 points total (no.63). who's the better longevity scorer? Most people would pick A.   * I'll divulge more stats: Player A averaged between 14 - 23 points per 100 possessions over 20 seasons. Player B - averaged between 23.1 - 44 points per 100 possessions over 13 seasons. Literally zero overlap in scoring. Who's the better longevity scorer? almost everyone would change their pick to Player B now. These 2 ppl btw are John Stockton and Stephen Curry.  Moving onto Lebron, Lebron has essentially recorded more points per 100 possessions than Kareem every year, every phase of their career. Now late in his 30s, Lebron is recording a full 10 points per 100 possessions more than Kareem at the same phase of their career. Lebron is already the more accomplished longevity scorer by any objective observer. And this again goes all the way back to the problem of points total, Kareem despite scoring less in every stage of his career has more total points simply because he played more games. Has nothing to do with his prowess as a scorer, nothing to do with his ability to sustain his level better, absolutely nothing to do with performance, and given both players have played 19+ seasons, clearly nothing to do with ""longevity"", it's simply a matter of running the numbers and playing the requisite number of games.    Same thing with Jordan. The man averaged more points per 100 possession aged 38 than Kareem ever did in his career. He's scored an order of magnitude more than Kareem ever did at any stage of their careers. The man also played 15 seasons, stretching from 21-39. He's a better scorer longevity wise than Kareem. It's pretty clear the only reason he didn't pass Kareem when he retired is because he decided not to chill on the wizards for longer, or stay on after the second 3peat.   TLDR: This whole points total thing is dumb no matter what angle or definition you look at it. It's even dumber when you consider the public's fixation with it as some great measure of longevity. If you still don't get it at this point, all I can say is good luck, have a nice day, and your job that requires any critical thinking. Ciao"
CP3 was washed that year and every game that series still came down to the final shots. Any game could have swung any way but 2019 chris paul wasn’t 2018 chris paul. Clint Capela was also playing abysmal. 2018 Rockets &gt; 2019 Rockets.   https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2019-nba-western-conference-semifinals-rockets-vs-warriors.html
"Jokic is literally having the best season of ALL TIME in terms of win shares, and you're telling me Harden or chris paul could be considered better players?  Just because this guy doesn't look super athletic, doesn't mean he's not great. He's basically the smartest player on the floor every single night (except when he's playing against Lebron), and he just seems to do no wrong out there. His impact is very clear, even despite the fact that he's averaging 26/14/6 while even shooting 41% from 3 with 4.4 attempts per game."
"One of them is on a one seeded team and the other his hanging on to a play-in spot. I’m not going to just take a guy out of the top five because he injured for the second half of the season, along with the other two front-runners for MVP(Lebron and Embiid), opening the way for Jokic to win it when it arguable should have/easily could have been Giannis or Chris Paul.  You don’t get in to the top five easily or quickly, nor do you drop out of it easily or quickly."
Chris Paul is barely 6’0. Was a decent athlete in his prime but nothing freakish.
"I think everyone's having KD, Curry, and Giannis in their Top 5 (in no particular order). I'd imagine almost everyone would keep LeBron up there, though I've heard some people argue he shouldn't be anymore. I personally think that's crap and have LeBron in my Top 5.  Then I think it starts to get messy. Jokic comes to mind and is probably who most people would put next, including me, but there might be some recency bias there.  Then you have the likes of (in no particular order) Lillard, Harden (he hasn't been having the best year, but it's been &lt; 20 games, let's not take him out of the convesation just yet), Embiid, Kawhi, AD, Paul George, and possibly the young guys (pun intended) like Luka and Trey. I think there's some reasonable argument for all of these guys to make it over Jokic, though it's stronger for some of them than others. Maybe you could add Westbrook to that list, but I'm not going to start on how I feel about him.  I'd probably say someone like Chris Paul, Donovan Mitchell, Booker, Beal is the best player in the league who **clearly** isn't a Top 5 player. I don't think anyone would put these guys in their Top 5 right now, but they're still playing at an elite level."
"Yeah idk man, paying Chris Paul or Westbrook 40 mil is a lot different than paying John Wall 40 mil"
"My problem with this question is that “physical limitations” are very subjective bc anyone who is successful in the NBA has physical gifts of some sort.   Chris Paul has elite hand eye coordination + deceptive strength and quickness, Kyle Korver had great height + shooting ability, Boris Diaw was a 6’8 thick dude with some great passing skills, etc. Guys who are truly physically limited aren’t able to make it in the NBA imo."
"Chris Paul and Westbrook are both still All-Star caliber players. Based on last season, John Wall is not that. He’s a solid starting point guard but realistically what team is that desperate for a point guard?   It’s not impossible to move him but it’s not like he’s a player that can raise your floor or ceiling by that much like Westbrook or CP3 which is what makes people say he has no trade value"
Chris Paul is the best 4th quarter ball handling point guard in the league.
"Chris Paul comes to mind for me, truly elite, but not top 5 (Durant, Lebron, Curry, Giannis, Kawhi)"
Scott Foster was the ref for two finals game this year and he's terrible.  And yes I'm a salty Chris Paul fan
Are you comparing John Wall to Chris Paul lol
"Hi Chris Paul!  Also new rule - if you want to get rid of your team owner for being a douchebag, you can."
Not worried about Phoenix. I trust Chris Paul to lose in heartbreaking fashion.  More worried about injuries. Steph may have 4-5 rings right now with a fully healthy roster every year in the playoffs.  Half of winning the chip is just being 100% come crunch time.
"The ""Wall has no trade value"" take is pretty silly  Year after year we see the contracts that everybody deems ""untradeable"" get traded  Chris Paul, Westbrook, and Wall have all been moved several times  A team like the Clippers would definetly give a Wall trade serious consideration"
Chris Paul doesn't exactly have many elite physical attributes and doesn't really rely on physical traits for his game either
"Because I love tier lists for some reason, I thought I'd list out actual players to avoid having like 35 guys in my top 25 or whatever  MJ  LeBron, Kareem  Magic, Duncan, Shaq, Kobe, Bird  Bill Russell, Hakeem, Wilt, Oscar  Steph, KD, Jerry West  KG, Moses, Dirk, Dr J  Karl Malone, Robinson, Barkley, Kawhi, AI  Baylor, Stockton, Giannis, Chris Paul, Wade, IT  Honestly should swap CP3 and AI but I hate him so idc"
Gianni is so lickable that even merging him with Chris Paul will result in a good guy
"How on Earth is Chris Paul having a better season than Trae? Harden is playing well but not as good as Trae imo, but it's close."
"chris paul dude, harden if you count him"
"Counting stats can hardly enter the conversation to justify a CP3 all-nba team, and I'm really reluctant to lean heavily on things like WS/48 or BPM for a player on a team that is on such a win-streak because then we're looking at a take that says the difference between an all-nba player in Chris Paul (.232 WS/48) and Frank Kaminsky (.241 WS/48) is 9 assists a game (Kaminsky 10ppg on 63.5 TS% and CP3 14ppg on 58 TS%). Advanced stats, this early on don't have a steady connection to a players ability and CP3 has not got the counting stats to compete with players like Dejounte Murray even if we heavily weight them toward assists.  Basically, yes, I get it, you have to find the compromise somewhere but CP3 on the list reeks of advanced stats counting for *some* players, team record counting for *some* players, boxscores counting for *some* players."
Chris Paul can create his own shot lol
Beautiful moment. Refreshing to watch Chris’ speech after Paul “I love myself so much I’d lick my own butthole” Pierce’s one
Paul and Chris both had incredible speeches
Chris Paul.
chris paul snubbed
This kid can get past looney but 2019 Chris Paul couldn’t?
DeAndre Jordan holding the ball at the end of a tie game while Chris Paul jumps up and down losing his shit: https://youtu.be/XNxr0m3YkX0
I'll never forget the game where Chris Paul got Kaman in the nuts and then Kaman shoved him out of bounds [lmao](https://youtu.be/nj8LNFTJX4o).
They would just double teaming or triple team them all the time or run the zone at them. I don’t know Chris Paul to me won’t make them the champions. It Hass to be a guy who can create his own shot like Booker or physically dominant person like Zion
"1. Derrick Rose   Idk about the rest but Rose is No. 1 by far. His MVP season is like, a middle of the road Chris Paul season yet some people try to act like he had a Steph Curry peak or something."
"Well remember we traded down to take him, instead of the real bust that is Chris Paul or another perennial bust, Deron Williams.  Webster was always a potential guy, would have a few good games then meh or injury. Liked him a lot on our team though."
"That's a great point I didn't consider the quality of teammates as well, I think Chris Paul could probably score a lot more against college defenses"
"yeah, i just think giannis is probably the one who could have the biggest impact.   the only thing that could be a problem is a player like chris paul who creates plays for his teammates may not be enough depending on the skill of the other players on the team"
"Chris Paul, Andre Drummond, Draymond Green, Isiah Thomas, Jeremy Lin."
"Lonzo, Drummond, Westbrook, Derozan, Zach Randolph, Joakim Noah, Josh Smith, Paul Millsap, Stoudemire, Bynum, Wiggins, Carmelo Anthony  And finally:  *Chris Paul*"
LeBron James  Kevin Durant  James Harden  Russell Westbrook  Chris Paul / Paul George
Damn people really are salty as fuck in here over a factual video  Chris Paul really got shooters here on r/nba
"Bill Laimbeer and Chris Paul would beat you on the floor and in the locker room, literally."
"Yup  It's weird because I don't really think Chris Paul is generally a liked player, he's one of the all-time floppers for sure   I guess people just dislike Westbrook more"
"The list:  1). Kevin Durant, Brooklyn Nets  2). Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks  3). LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers  4). Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors  5). Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets  6). Luka Doncic, Dallas Mavericks  7). Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers  8). James Harden, Brooklyn Nets  9). Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers  10). Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers  11). Jimmy Butler, Miami Heat  12). Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics  13). Devin Booker, Phoenix Suns  14). Chris Paul, Phoenix Suns  15).

Julius Randle, New York Knicks  30). Ben Simmons, Philadelphia 76ers"
Prime Westbrook was just the type of player that gave Chris Paul trouble. Hes a great defender. Westbrook just wasn't guardable by smaller guys.
"&gt;Please tell me where it says warriors series.  ""Had a rough series against Utah. He was alot better against the Dubs. Also for the TO he was facing serious trap coverage due to Chris Paul being very bad. The 3.8 TO he averaged in that series lines up with the RS anyway.""  If that isn't enough evidence, the thread was literally created with a game from the Warriors series.  &gt;Bruh you can have 20 assists and still have a usage rate of 0. It doesn't account for their overall offensive creation  You technically could, but that's not realistic. It can't account for assists but it usually does a decent enough job of portraying how often a player finishes a play with the ball in their hands.   Even ignoring that it's just common sense, neither one of them were high volume scorers like any of the other listed players, with the closest ones being CP3 and Magic, who's AST/TOV ratio are much better despite shouldering a much greater level of the offensive production.  Nash: 2.75 AST/TOV  Kidd: 2.85 AST/TOV"
Chris Paul shot 3/14 in game 5 and in general shit the bed that series IMO
"Had a rough series against Utah. He was alot better against the Dubs  Also for the TO he was facing serious trap coverage due to Chris Paul being very bad. The 3.8 TO he averaged in that series lines up with the RS anyway. He usually averages 4-5 TO as do most other stars in his situation like Russ, 2015/16 Steph and Luka"
2018 Chris Paul and 2019 Chris Paul were two different players.
They definitely had a opportunity to eliminate the warriors with the series being tied 2 to 2 and Kd out and harden and Chris Paul healthy. Especially after getting so close to doing it the year before against the warriors with a healthy Kd.
"Not gonna lie, when Kd went out and the series was tied and Chris Paul was healthy I thought there was a chance Warriors we're gonna lose the series. That's when people started saying Warriors were fun to watch again without Kd."
"Kd went out when the series was tied 2 to 2. I mean they had a chance to get it done, and Chris Paul was there whos injury was supposed to be the main reason they lost, the year before."
"Well I mean they missed a bunch of threes. And who knows what would of happened with Chris, it was scary no doubt as a Warriors fan. Then the next year warriors beat the rockets with Chris Paul in Houston after Curry was scoreless in the first half and went off for 33 in the 2nd without Kd. They lost kd when the series was tied 2 to 2 and ended up taking the series."
"Yes, but Maravich’s passing highlights are more spectacular than Chris Paul’s, yet Paul is a much more efficient passer."
Would have lost to Rockets if it weren’t for Chris Paul injury and a ridiculous amount of missed 3’s in a row. We just pretending that didn’t happen now
"They didn’t need him to contend, but they needed him to win.  They literally lost in the finals without him. Doesn’t matter what their regular season record was. They lost  Then if it wasn’t for a Chris Paul injury and a ridiculous amount of missed 3’s in a row, they would have lost to the Rockets with him"
"Bro, seriously? You got fans of teams offering Malik Beasley and Goran Dragic and you're telling me you wouldn't even want to entertain a discussion for Jamal Murray or Chris Paul?"
"Offensively they do get worse, I won't deny that. But their defense improves a lot with Simmons over Chris Paul. A big problem in the Finals against Milwaukee was that Holiday and Middleton took turns going at Paul chase he was too short to really do anything to them other than foul.  Also that young core would be insane in just a year or two when LeBron turns 39 or 40. They'll all be in their primes."
Perkins has said it was Chris Paul that Ray wanted and that lines up with rumours at the time of a potential Rondo/Paul swap.   And we know Danny Ainge tried to make a deal for Paul around that time (he's spoken about it in the past).
"I think Nash,especially if we’re talking about current NBA. Nash would shoot it more while doing his insane playmaker shit, and you can hide him on defence well enough. Also I think Nash’s personality is more agreeable while Chris Paul is a more polarizing person."
"Would have been a lot more than a 3-way battle. You also had Kawhi, Harden, and Giannis. Could probably add Chris Paul as well. Plus the potential for just a really solid team to surprise one of those superstars."
"You know what I like to do to distinguish Tim Duncan from Kobe Bryant? Count the MVPs and finals MVPs for Tim compared to Kobe. Or reflect on Kobe Bryant missing the playoffs, entirely, in his absolute prime, when he didn't have elite big men to coattail. Not some meaningless FIBA basketball where Kobe Bryant played like complete dog shit but was bailed out by superior players in LeBron and Wade(much better player in the olympics than Kobe). Chris Bosh, of all people, also played better than him. Tim Duncan in 2004, even for how badly he got hammered and triple teamed when he touched the ball(without call), still obliterates Kobe's 2008 US team run. And keep in mind, instead of having LeBron, Chris Paul and Wade feeding him, Tim Duncan had Stephon Marbury, Allen Iverson, Richard Jefferson and Lamar Odom.  Tim Duncan in 2004 olympics: 12.9PPG(57% FG, 75%FT), 9.1RPG, 1.6APG, 0.8SPG, 1.4BPG  Kobe Bryant in 2008 olympics: 15PPG(46%FG, 58%FT), 2.8RPG, 2.1APG, 1.1SPG, 0.5BPG"
"His stock definitely fell over the years that's for sure. I do think he is still a good coach, but he really needs a coach-player type to on his team to excel -- Like a Rondo or Chris Paul to help keep some team composure or something."
Name a duo more iconic than Chris Paul and extremely unfortunate injuries that ruin his teams aspirations.  Poor CP3 😔
Chris Paul because I watched him pull what was supposed to be a bottom-feeding Thunder team up to the 4th seed
Chris Paul was All-Defensive 1st team in 2009 &amp; 2012-2017.  CP3’s defense make the difference IMO.
"The Thunder team can go eat a fat bag of dicks. We traded Wiggins and literally the next game against them, Chris Paul decided he was going to follow the rules and snitched about an untucked jersey."
I was expecting this to go back to the Chris Paul veto or the Harden trade.
Someone find out where Chris Paul was last night.
Okay and based on the upside Davion Mitchell could become Chris Paul.  Every prospect looks great when you set no realistic expectations
"I think Chris Paul is the definition of a point guard, it’s definitely my own opinion but I think him and Stockton are the two best true point guards of all time. Defense, passing, can score when needed, and leadership.   I have no idea what happened before the mid 80s as well. Nash is probably next on the list but I think DiAntoni should get some credit for Nash. That team was well built with so many good players and the style fit Nash very well. Paul has been one of the best on so many styles of teams."
I'm picking CP3 too. But I think Trae is a better scorer than year 3 chris paul. At the rest I feel like CP3 is better
Chris Paul
Chris Paul and it’s not very close
"Trae Young averaged 25 points and 9 assists in his third season.  In his 3rd season, Chris Paul led the league in assists &amp; steals with 11.6 assists and 2.7 steals while averaging 21 points &amp; 4 rebounds."
"Chris Paul pretty easily for me, I know it's unpopular but I just think he's the better floor general on both sides of the ball"
"Why does it feel like Webber always want's to play the ""victim"". My man, just own up to the stuff you did wrong and move on.  He has so many ""diva"" moments that supposedly never were his fault, that it makes one wonder. From college to his rookie year with the warriors, to the dissing of his old Fab 5 team mates, to locker room fights with team mates and even blatantly cheating in a foot race on Inside the NBA, where Kenny clearly won. He is a narcissist of the highest order.  I've had it with Chris Webber, that whiny diva, I hope he snubs his toe or accidentally shits himself like Paul Pierce or something."
"Both were amazing floor generals but I might give a slight edge to Nash. And while CP3 is a great shooter, Nash is one of the GOAT shooters. For my team's offense I'd take Nash. But CP3 is the better defender by miles, so overall I'd lean CP3 for a single game or a single playoff series. If we're factoring in health, then I'll take Nash.   But this sub is the wrong place to ask. The needle seems to have swung the other way on Chris Paul after people were reminded of his antics in the playoffs and after he blew a 2-0 lead in the finals."
Chris Paul
Chris Paul jumping up and down yelling at DJ to dunk it that one time sums it up perfectly.
"A different coach doesn't really do anything to the freak things that happened to them.  Doc coaching doesn't have any affect on whether or not Chris Paul breaks his hand or Blake messes up his knee.  Like JJ and Blake said, shit just happens."
"I'd say Chris Paul almost every year in the playoffs qualifies as well  His numbers look great every year, but he always seems to fall just short and got a bit of a bad reputation for it, especially when he played for the Clippers"
"The thing that I HATED about these clippers weren't their talent or record or anything, it was always about the incessant whining and complaining that really irked me.   I despised Chris Paul back then cause not a play would go by, good or bad, that he wasn't harping on the refs or complaining about whatever. The rest of the clippers followed suit and it just made them so easy to hate on.   I would've loved to see Blake flourish and dunk over everyone but the more the Clippers emulated this whiny attitude, the more I just wished they got blown out by 55 in the first quarter every game."
I would literally take every player at their position on the younger team over the old team except for Chris Paul over Trae Young (and the gap there has narrowed a lot). The older team has players which will all be worse this year whereas the younger team should all be better.
"i was gonna say KG but he’s generally around 15 and on the low end usually at 20, just starting a team and i get to build around a player for their prime, he’d be too 10 for me, but that’s only a 5ish spot difference   i’d say chris paul, he’s usually top 30-35, i think i’d start a team with him like top 15-20"
"besides the positioning and anticipation and boxing out that you can do, as someone shorter, if your reach/jump is decent you either need to jump before everybody else or after.   If before, you are trying to get to the ball first, so this takes some luck/timing.   If after, you are trying to dislodge/snag a loose ball, this one requires some solid hands/coordination.  watch rubio/rondo, obviously those guys are still athletic as hell and long, but they use these moves a lot. Muggsey is the king to look at for this sneaky stuff, chris paul is great too.  you can also just sit in their blindspot as someone goes up and try to swipe/knock it out, most decent ballers secure their rebound, but everybody slips up at some point.  another useful when you are stuck trying to battle down low with a big is to get their arms/hands/legs tangled up, just leaning with your booty can be enough, this can hopefully tie you guys out of the play so someone else can get it. good luck out there, relentlessness is underrated here."
"His career high is 12.7 as a starter, with all time playmaker Chris Paul throwing him lobs. He's not being brought in as a scorer, he's a 7 footer with fouls to give."
"I think Trae has the possibility of giving you higher highs and lower lows. If you have a team perfectly built around Trae, I think your ceiling is higher, but CP3 is such a good fit on any team, he has little to no weaknesses and is great under pressure.   If I'm starting from scratch and fully constructing a team with any players I take Trae, but if I'm just adding one to my team I probably take CP3. New Orleans/LAC Chris Paul with Luka, KP and THJ would be incredible."

Chris paul is a locker room cancer. That’s what happened
chris paul tried to beat them up
Chris Paul making actual careers out here
Lmao. Because I don’t support Harden I’m not a Rockets fan? I was a fan long before him. Also there’s no guarantee that they win if Chris Paul stays healthy. 3-2 is not a insurmountable hole. Harden has folded in too many high pressure situations for that to be a guarantee
"&gt;Chris Paul in a series where he averaged an efficient 25/10 and was by far the best player on the floor across the whole thing  It was legitimately an all time great playoff performance, yet somehow is mentioned. His second option was 75 year old Jamal Crawford. Some of the dumbest shit I have seen"
"Chris Paul. Over a decade ago.  Can't say more, still hurts to talk about it."
"Chris Paul averaged 12.8 PPG off 36.8% FG in 2012 against the Spurs in the WCSF.  It was a major choke. They even blew a huge game at home when they were up by like 24 or something crazy. I remember watching that game live.   Chris Paul played horribly in 2012 and was definitely the superstar who underdelivered the most that postseason. If not CP3, then who?   EDIT: Oh, I didn’t notice he gave an Honorable Mention to Chris Paul in 2017."
"This post is stupid as hell, it has no consistency or analytical basis, and for some reason you mentioned Chris Paul in a series where he averaged an efficient 25/10 and was by far the best player on the floor across the whole thing  Just random-ass hate"
Chris Paul......
booker is giving chris paul a lift
The 3rd and fourth best guards or that era were Hal Greer and John Havlicek. Neither of those players are in the same stratosphere as Chris Paul and Steve nash.
"Heh, this is Utah Jazz music.  You let them blow by you and force them into a midrange shot.  We've been doing it for years and it works.  The trick is the perimeter defender just can't be terribly stupid and at least knows to switch to an open shooter.    Note that this strategy doesn't work if the other team has Chris Paul."
"I think chris paul was the best player on the rockets this year.  In 2019 wcsr it was harden vs kd, with curry going nuclear in the 2nd half of game 6"
"Chris Paul saw this one coming and was like nope, let me get my last contract and peace."
"With respect, I'm not sure I could possibly disagree more.   I'm pretty sure the most basketball action I've ever missed due to injury is in the ballpark of six weeks (hand surgery, broken wrist, moderate to severe ankle sprains). After a month and a half off, I basically feel like I have to re-learn how the game works. And no matter how much running and strength training I try to build during rehabilitation, nothing quite matches up with getting back into live runs.   The good news: I'm a nothing basketball player mixing back in with nothing fellow basketball players.   But then I try to imagine being on the wrong side of 30 and undergoing two knee operations in the same year, rehabbing, returning, failing, re-injuring, a second operation, rehabbing, etc. And after 350 days away from basketball, I try to imagine returning to the NBA where I'm expected to still be the 1A or 1B option on a team that's been hollowed out since I went down.   Frankly, yeah, I wouldn't be too surprised that a dude playing point forward after a year off didn't have the explosion to elude his defender with a live dribble along the perimeter and slither past helpside for dunks for his first few weeks back.   For some reason, I watched those Blake Pistons games last year. And believe it or not, he didn't leave a whole lot of dunk opportunities on the table. Every team would stack the floor when he held the ball on the perimeter and dare him to settle for a J or welcome him to slowly dribble into the teeth of the defense. He wasn't LAC Blake in Detroit; he was seen as some sort of weird Chris Paul/Blake Griffin hybrid, which kind of worked when healthy but dude was toast after that year off."
"“Hello, police? Chris Paul is trying to beat me up!”"
Deandre was great defensively for those years on a contending team plus the center class was weak I wouldn’t give Chris paul all the credit it’s not like his offense got him that spot.
He made 1 First Team All-NBA and 2 3rd teams with the Clips. He should thank Chris Paul for those awards and the fat ass contracts he's gotten
I’m just saying there’s a counterfactual to all of these guys being “proven to get buckets in clutch situations.” They’ve also been proven to NOT get buckets in clutch situations. I can look up the stats if you want me to but they aren’t great. Kyrie made that huge shot in 2016 but also has atrocious shooting percentage in playoff clutch situations. Jimmy has missed a ton of big shots as well. Paul sometimes doesn’t show up at all to big games. Chris Paul gets hurt.   They are all capable of balling out on any given night. But so is KAT. And KATs going to show up to shit. He’s not going to act like a moron on social media. Maybe a bit cringe but not bring all this ridiculous negative energy to your team.
"They have not always shown up in the playoffs. Chris Paul, with the exception of this year, hasn’t performed well in the playoffs. Paul George has completely fallen flat in playoff series. Kyrie’s playoff performances have been anything but consistent. Same could be said of Jimmy.   All of these guys are injury prone and locker room cancers. But on that note, KAT has been hurt himself."
"Jimmy getting 2 wins against the lakers with 2 of the 5 heat starters injured was ridiculous, they also gentlemen swept the bucks that year. Im not a paul George fan but he stepped up quite a bit this year and did well with Indiana taking the prime Heatles to 6 games meanwhile he had teammates like Roy Hibbert scoring 0 points. Chris paul would have won a ring with the rockets if he didn't injure his hamstring they were up 3-2 against the GSW who had a healthy curry kd and klay. Kyrie also shot one of the most significant shots in finals history back in 2016 which swung the momentum enough for the cars to win"
"Some of these its personal preference but I refuse to believe that anyone could consider kat right now to be a better player than paul george, chris paul, jimmy butler, or kyrie. They are the elite players and have shown up in the playoffs"
