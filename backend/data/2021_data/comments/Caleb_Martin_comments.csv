"I wanna say caleb and cody martin, but i refuse to believe anyone outside our team knows who these bums are"
"Congratulations, you're now a mod on r/CharlotteHornets!   None of us understood it, it was very frustrating. Last season Cody Martin showed some promise as a hustle/defense guy, but he's been awful this season. And Caleb has mostly just been awful. I can appreciate the hustle they bring to the locker room or something, but they're so offensively limited that it completely offsets. Part of the reason we gave up a big run at the start of the 4th was because of Caleb's presence on the floor."
because borrego didn't play him for the first 17 games for caleb and cody martin for god knows why. 99% of hornets fans wanted him to absorb all their minutes.
Caleb Martin over Lamelo ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Malik monk popping off though!
You mean Cody Zeller and Caleb Martin?   I‚Äôm in!!
Add the Cody and Caleb Martin for max confusion  Would that team win the championship thru gamebreaking exploits?
Can Caleb Martin also be better before getting stupid amounts of playing time then
"Caleb Martin looks decent by the 538 model (this season #3 on the team, #1 on the team last season).   Not really vouching for Martin, I don't feel too strongly, but it doesn't seem like an blatantly awful decision to play him in crunch time."
"Its really hard to justify his actions lately, he does have some excuses like only having biyombo to work with and us being relatively young, but his decisions are just so bad. Can you tell me a reason to play caleb martin for 13 minutes straight? Or continually playing zone defense when you are getting rained on from three? Its hard to argue in his favor."
"I agree he was making lazy passes yesterday maybe some arguably because Cody zeller was in his first game back and had no chemistry with him but like I said it‚Äôs not even benching melo alone, it‚Äôs giving all his minutes to a player who shouldn‚Äôt even be getting significant minutes on any team. Caleb Martin literally checked in at 4:53 in the 3rd and checked out at 3:18 in the 4th. He played for over 13 minutes straight as a hustle player who provides almost nothing offensively or defensively."
"I don't fault him for not playing LaMelo after that god awful first half, but giving Caleb Martin more minutes is absolutely laughable, especially when there's a potential-filled former lottery pick at that position rotting on the bench dying to get minutes."
"Clown coach. Played caleb martin 13 straight minutes yesterday which is counterproductive to benching melo, if you're gonna do that at least play someone actually impactful."
"Those are pretty tough ones, but I‚Äôll try: Kostas Antetokounmpo, Nick Claxton, Kent Bazemore, Ivica Zubac, Bryn Forbes, Maxi Kleber, Matisse Thybulle, Nickel Alexander-Walker, Caleb Martin, aaaaaaand Damian Lillard?"
Cody Martin and Caleb Martin.
Caleb Martin gets the start tonight in place of day to dayward. Raps by 50
"""Caleb Martin is the next Jeremy Lamb"" - JB probably, as he force feeds him 35 minutes"
Wonder what his beef with Caleb Martin was about.
So Boogie got fined less than Caleb Martin did for standing up for his brother who got headbutted?
"Seriously, no one here knows lol. IMO it is still related to the drug thing, but the FO and coaching staff just don‚Äôt want to admit that in public. Fortunately we are winning games even with Caleb Martin taking his minutes."
CALEB MARTIN AT NUMBER ONE BABYYYYYY!  Nevada represent.
Caleb Martin is insanely athletic
"Devonte Graham, Terry Rozier, Gordan Hayward, Miles Bridges, PJ Washington, Bismack Biyombo, Caleb Martin, Cody Martin, Malik Monk, Jalen McDaniels, Cody Zeller"
honestly the hornets usually have multiple top ten plays in the nba top 10... prob grabbed 2 tonight maybe 3. scary terry and caleb martin threw it down
With all due respect nobody cares about caleb and cody martin üòÇ
"Hornets:  Ball  Bridges  Washington  Graham RFA rights  McDaniels  Hayward  Rozier  Monk RFA rights  Unprotected: Cody Martin, Caleb Martin, Vernon Carey, Nick Richards, Grant Riller"
"Oh right. How could I forget. That's a really strong team. You could have a pretty deep line-up of:  * Coach: Pau * C: Marc/Brook &amp; Robin Lopez/Cody &amp; Tyler Zeller * Wings: Giannis/Marcus &amp; Markieff/Justin Holiday/Thanasis/Kostas/Caleb &amp; Cody Martin * Guards: Steph/Jrue/Lonzo &amp; LaMelo Ball/Seth/Aaron Holiday  Would have to send some of these guys to the G-League affiliate, since it's over 15 now.  This team is definitely a championship caliber team."
"JB: Oh you mean, let‚Äôs start Caleb Martin over Graham? Got it!"
It took me forever to realize that Caleb Martin had a twin. I saw the dude in one place then the other. Was mad confused for a minute
caleb martin
"Generally speaking, once Kupchak was hired we started cutting losses from the end of the Bobcats-early Hornets 2.0 era and started drafting a lot better. We didn‚Äôt have much to build on and our picks were still in the 9-12 range for the several drafts before last year‚Äôs. We let Kemba walk in free agency, along with MKG, Marvin Williams, Frank Kaminsky, etc, as all were kinda one side of the ball limited players.   Kupchak has drafted Miles Bridges (12th), Devonte‚Äô Graham (35th), PJ Washington (12th), and LaMelo (2nd). We‚Äôve picked up Cody and Caleb Martin, and Jalen McDaniels as second rounders or undrafted free agents with some potential. We got Terry Rozier in a sign and trade with Boston when Kemba left and the contract was considered iffy, but he‚Äôs definitely lived up to it. We also signed Hayward this offseason with a similar reaction from the league and he‚Äôs still got a ways to go to earn it, but so far, so good. Only Malik Monk and Cody Zeller remain from the pre-Kupchak era and we brought Bismack Biyombo back.   We‚Äôre still kinda straddling building for the future and winning now, but the general consensus is that we‚Äôre young and competitive with potential to internally improve. We still need a solid big man or three, but otherwise we‚Äôve got a pretty solid roster for now and the future."
The CHA box score isn't even close to correct.  Caleb Martin definitely played.  Jalen McDaniels definitely played.  Hayward had 27 minutes towards the end of the third.  Lamelo had more than 9 points.
Cody Martin and Caleb Martin?
"LaMelo Ball / Cody Martin / Caleb Martin / Jalen McDaniels / Bismack Biyombo  It's our own death, but still"
"You can't compare Caleb to Cody Martin, they're completely different players and even wear different colored shoes so you can tell them apart. /s"
"Eh I dont agree with the martins being better defenders, martins are average at best but they do draw a lot of charges. I'll admit they do hustle but doesn't really change for me because a lot of the time they play out of their role when on the floor. If they just hustled and hit open shots then I'd be fine with them but I don't want to watch a caleb martin iso."
"Sterling Brown deflects it though, still a heads up shot from Caleb Martin though."
caleb martin mvp!
Caleb Martin drives me up the wall
Kyle Lowry and Caleb Martin because they are both 90% ass
"Caleb Martin. Sometimes makes a cool dunk or does some crazy hustle play, but 90% of the time he's an absolute garbage basketball player that believes he's capable of way more than he is. Borrego doesn't have a ton of options now so he has to play him, but there was no excuse for giving him minutes before the Hayward, Ball, and Monk injuries."
"Being able to play Defense against Brad Wanamaker, P.J. Washington, and Caleb Martin was tight, not gonna get too excited lol"
i'd cut Caleb Martin for him in a heartbeat  i'd cut Caleb Martin for an empty roster spot as well but that's beside the point
"There were 3 plumlees at one point too, but I guess mason is the only one now   Cody and Caleb Martin  Brook and Robin Lopez   Steph and Seth curry.   The Morris twins  The Hernangomez brothers  Jalen and Jaden McDaniels  The Ball Boys"
buy out caleb martin and send him to a contender then
Even still. Kyrie over Kemba. Marcus smart over Caleb Martin. Trae young over Pat Bev.
"ehhh, I don't know about that. I was thinking:     Cody Martin + 2nd rounder for LeBron  Caleb Martin + 2nd rounder for Steph"
Cody Martin and Caleb Martin.
"Cody Martin, Caleb Martin, Kelan Martin, KJ Martin, Martin Lawrence"
Our coach staff confused Cody Zeller with Cody Martin and Cody Martin with Caleb Martin.  Our entire game plan got thrown out the window.
It was actually Caleb Martin who got drafted in the second round. Cody was an undrafted FA
Cody and Caleb Martin
Tacko for Caleb Martin pls
Cody/Caleb Martin in shambles
Caleb ‚ÄúDraymond Green‚Äù Martin
"somehow Brad hasn't been a catastrophe. He's had 4 or 5 pretty solid games, most of the time he just kinda exists and looks like a low 2nd/decent 3rd string PG, and then there's others where you just wish Kupchak would cut him tomorrow and save Borrego from himself (like we should've done with Caleb Martin and Biz a while ago)"
Caleb &amp; Cody Martin! /s
Caleb martin and Cody martin
Cody Martin = Caleb Martin
Caleb Martin = Cody Martin
Caleb and Cody Martin
"there might be a lot of new blood in the playoffs this year. 12 members of the Hornets were drafted (or went undrafted and picked up) by Charlotte since the last time we made the playoffs in 2016, and have never played anywhere else. We're not a lock for the playoffs now, but are a play-in team.  Malik Monk, Miles Bridges, Devonte' Graham, PJ Washington, Jalen McDaniels, Cody Martin, Caleb Martin, LaMelo Ball, Vernon Carey, Nick Richards, Grant Riller, and Nate Darling have never seen the NBA playoffs.  Hayward (Utah and Boston), Rozier (Boston), Wanamaker (Boston), Biyombo (Charlotte and Toronto), and Zeller (Charlotte) have been there before."
I wish we could give you Caleb Martin
Someone needs to clip that highlight of Caleb Martin stealing from CJ McCollum and yamming it on him
"This is pretty misleading.    The three second rounders were Grant Riller (PG), Vernon Carey Jr (C) and Nick Richards (C)   Riller has barely played any minutes and as one of the last picks in the draft he is likely very raw.  Graham, Rozier, Monk, Wanamaker and a Martin in front of him makes sense if the team is trying to be competitive. If it's garbage time the HC has gone with two-way player Nate Darling, whom I would assume is closer to being ready for minutes than Riller is.    The Martin problem: Cody Martin has been a decent bench guy throughout the season and has no reason to be replaced by Riller or Darling at any competitive moment of basketball.  There was an in-depth writeup on this on /r/CharlotteHornets the other day.    Caleb Martin, the UDFA Martin, is quite raw but has shown flashes.  He just came off a 15-10-3 game against the Lakers, one of the best teams in the NBA.  I could still see Caleb being significantly better than Darling/Riller at any competitive stages of basketball.    Bismack Biyombo may have stone hands but he is the only defensive player and true rim protector  the team has in the front court. If there's anyone on the roster that even has a chance to attempt to slow down the other team's best bigs it's going to be Biyombo.  Throwing out Vernon Carey (who I really believe in) or Nick Richards at this point will get them eaten alive on the defensive end in the paint, while still allowing the shooters to drop buckets from 3 as we've seen all season.    I do think we will see some of these players in the closing weeks, and really there is no point not to because the Hornets players are dropping fast, but to say that there's no reason why these second rounders haven't played is just inaccurate."
Shit.. I wanted to keep riding the Caleb Martin wave.
"&gt; Pretty sure he‚Äôs the 3rd ever second round rookie who has multiple 20 point games  there's no way that's accurate. It can't be that uncommon.  Off the top of my head, Isaiah Thomas, Malcolm Brogdon, Jokic, and that's just the last few years. Hell, Caleb Martin went undrafted and was a point shy of back-to-back 20 point games for us last season before the season ended, he only played like the final quarter of the season, and he sucks ass.  Maybe he's the 3rd 2nd round rookie for the Bucks to do that? Behind Brogdon and Ramon Sessions maybe?"
"Caruso came off the bench. We had McDaniels and Caleb Martin starting, who are recent G-Leaguers, and Biz who regularly gets DNPs now. Off the bench we had two more G-Leaguers playing significant minutes in Cody Martin and Wannamaker, who the Warriors paid us to take."
I'll maintain that his player development so phenomenal and his in-game coaching needs work. Man is *very* slow to make changes and gets pretty attached to players even if they shouldn't get minutes (see Caleb Martin.) If he can work on his in-game decisions and keep up the player development side I'm happy to keep him.
Caleb and Cody Martin please
"Hornets protect:  Ball, Rozier, Bridges, Washington, Monk (RFA rights), Graham (RFA rights), McDaniels, Hayward*  Hornets leave unprotected:  Vernon Carey, Nick Richards, Cody Martin, Caleb Martin  UFAs unable to be claimed:  Biyombo, Zeller, Wanamaker, Riller, Darling  --  * I would honestly consider leaving Hayward unprotected- I really don't think an expansion team would want him taking up so much cap room given they operate under a reduced cap for the first couple years, it would be incredibly restrictive. But I do think that Hayward does have some amount of trade value,  so we shouldn't risk it just to save Vernon Carey, who would definitely get snatched up by an expansion team."
don‚Äôt forget the co mvp season from Caleb and Cody Martin
If the hornets had to pick Caleb Martin or Cody Martin who would they choose
Caleb Martin has some pretty sick dunks too    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpjDeTHc3V4  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBFEb5fL7c4  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E37YwEPHaZU
the sight of Cody Martin attempting to take anybody off the dribble  the sight of Caleb Martin being on the court  literally every time Gordon Hayward falls down  honorable mention- those god damn Biyombo floaters....
Caleb and Cody Martin are also brothers but they're not better than anyone here
it MIGHT have stopped JB from playing Caleb Martin so I'm pretty sure it would've been enough to get into the 7/8 game
Caleb Martin occasionally shows signs of being a 10th man but is usually not NBA caliber whatsoever
Caleb Martin maybe Cody Martin
Did Caleb Martin switch seats on the bench with Cody Martin? (2021 article)
The jump from Caleb Martin to Kelly Oubre Jr is gonna be insane
"that turnover was really bad even by Caleb Martin standards, jesus christ"
"It would be D-League players all the way down the line imo  If the peak Process Sixers can win 10 games in a season (and I think they're the mostly deliberately bad roster assembled in the last 20 years), you need something considerably worse.  Using players that I know played minutes last season:  Starters: Michael Carter-Williams, Caleb Martin, Cody Martin, Alen Smilagic, Cristiano Felicio  Bench: Kris Dunn, Hamidou Diallo Jarrett Culver, Henry Ellenson, Jahlil Okafor  Just an absolutely horrific group of players, where no one player is ever an actual threat to take over and win you a game. The defense here is almost competent and I think at some point, the stars align and they have one game against a really bad team that's stuck in their own heads and win like 72-69"
"He isn't.  There's this huge base of hornets fans that have seen Caleb Martin play and just put it onto his brother as well. Cody is actually a really solid defensive player, definitely worth a 9th or 10th spot on the bench. His perimeter defense is above average and he's known as the guy on the roster that dives for every single lose ball and puts crazy effort into every possession. Yes his brother sucks and yes he isn't the best on offense but for certain games, certain matchups, he's certainly playable.  I'd compare him to MCW without the high draft status which, if people were honest, is certainly a quality 9th or 10th man.   /rant"
He could be a Caleb/Cody Martin replacement right? Just hustle on D and hit a couple of 3s each game.
"I'm personally stoked. We got a guy that fits our wing depth needs at a tremendous discount, and he'll be a reliable, 6th man option for us. His fit with LaMelo, Terry, Hayward, and Miles will be much better than his time in GS. Plus, he will be much better for us as a injury-replacemrnt option, so that we dont have to play guys like Bismack Biyombo, Caleb Martin, or Brad Wannamaker extended minutes.   Look, we don't need him to be a 28ppg guy, we just need him to run, play defense, and score sometimes.   I watched Lace shoot 17% from 3 for us, so I can tolerate Kelly's ""terrible"" 33%."
"Denzel Valentine, Andre Drummond, Elfrid Payton, Jeff Teague, Kelly Oubre, Kyle Kuzma, Mario Hezonja, Dwayne Bacon, Caleb Martin, Hassan Whiteside"
"Once again, Charlotte literally had Cody and Caleb Martin, IDENTICAL TWINS, on their roster last year. Both nameplates were simply ‚ÄúMartin‚Äù."
"Don't you mean Caleb Martin? Cody was starting for you guys at the end of the year, while due to injury he does play his role well. Good defender.  Caleb doesn't play as much so I've assumed he is worse."
"If we did that and didn't wave Caleb Martin, we could have had C. Martin, C. Martin, L. Ball, L. Ball, and L. Ball on the same team. Scorekeepers woulda been losing it lmao"
"He looks at least 2"" shorter than Antonio Blakeney who is listed at 6'4. Still worth a shot to see if he can be a better version of Caleb Martin."
NOOOO! RIP Nevada legend Caleb Martin. Your brother will carry your good name.
"Those of you who think this is a bad move for us clearly have never watched the likes of:  Caleb Martin Cody Martin Marco Bellini MKG after the injuries Old ass Corey Maggette Adonal Foyal Lance Stephenson shooting 17% from 3 for a season.  Or whoever else we throw out when Hayward gets hurt, and Miles gets covid, and LaMelo is hurt, and PJ gets hurt, all at the same time.   We need legit depth on the wings."
"Lol. No fkin‚Äô way. You have the worst center rotation in the league at Cody and Biyombo. You had to play Caleb Martin significant minutes. Graham was also trash all season.  If ya‚Äôll get Markknen, this may be your best roster in a long time."
"Caleb Martin has the confidence of Kobe, but shot 24% from 3 for the season. If that‚Äôs any indication."
The upgrade from Caleb Martin to Kelly Oubre Jr would be massive!
Yep that‚Äôs why in his exit interview he said he just wanted to feel wanted. Favoring Caleb Martin over him a lot certainly does that. Had the longest leash in the last four years that I‚Äôve seen out of any player on our roster that got meaningful minutes.
"He didn‚Äôt play much because James Borrego has some of the worst rotations at any level of the sport, 3v3 pickup games included. There was no world where Caleb and Cody Martin deserved the minutes they got."
"CHA already does have Cody &amp; Caleb Martin ,  and Cody Zeller.  If they get Zo and sign Tyler Zeller as the 21st man off the bench they could have a record"
TJ warren is good. Dennis Smith JR is bad. Cody and Caleb Martin are okay.   All the other guys that made it didn't last more than a few games or a summer League or something.
"Cody martin is an decent bench perimeter defender, caleb martin is completely useless"
We also did a nepotism for Cody Martin's trash twin brother right after we drafted him in the 2nd round so it's not like there isn't a precedent. All Liangelo has to do is not be worse than Caleb Martin to get on the main roster
"Hornets protect LaMelo, Bridges, Washington, Hayward, Rozier, McDaniels, and the RFA rights on Graham and Monk. That means one of Vernon Carey, Nick Richards, Cody Martin, Caleb Martin is available to be selected. I don't like parting with Carey but ours is a pretty easy top 8."
"The fans who are going to be watching Nate Hinton, Caleb Martin, Cassius Winston, and Sharife Cooper duke it out? Yeah, they'd deserve that prize money tbh"
Caleb Martin hero balling and bricking has taken years off my life. Literally a plague. I wish him the best.
‚ÄúI do not ever want to run into Caleb Martin and not be able to go up and give ‚Äòem a hug‚Äù
"Probably not, Caleb Martin was already a FA, he was cut a while ago, he's awful  If someone like Richards or Iwundu is cut, it'll probably be for LiAngelo, I still don't think we have roster spots but I could be wrong."
"Tbf, Caleb Martin is a G-League player that is on a team because his twin brother is actually playable for 5 minutes a game. That being said, he would whoop any r/nba user who isnt secretly Kevin Durant, so he could beat about half of them"
"Ok, but is the skill gap between LeBron James and Celeb Martin greater than the skill gap between Caleb Martin and your average r/nba user?"
"Ok sorry I pretty only follow 1 team, who is Labron Jemes, and how could you think he is better then the goat Caleb Martin."
"LeBron James is better than Caleb Martin, and it's not even close."
Cody Martin  Caleb Martin  Caleb Martin  Caleb Martin  Cody Martin  Caleb Martin
"Cam Reddish, Alperen Sengun, Amir Coffey and Caleb Martin are getting to the line more frequently per game. Damn."
Unfortunately for the Heat too probably. Caleb Martin is awful at everything and wont play within his role
"Caleb (Martin) is a Miami Heat(er?) now, unfortunately (for him)"
"Yurtseven and strus mostly , Caleb Martin looks pretty good on defense too"
"I've met a few before they were NBA players or after they had retired. Never met a current NBA player.  I met Kyrie when he came to my highschool while he was at Duke. Honestly don't know why he was there. He wasn't insane yet at this point. He was chill.  I met Dennis Smith JR, TJ Warren, Lorenzo brown (in and out the league), and Omer Yurtseven, Caleb and Cody Martin all at NC State when I was a student there. All were chill. Dennis Smith thought he was god on campus though lmao.   I met Sidney Lowe at a basketball camp NC State held when he was the coach when I was a kid. All I remember is he had monster size hands.   I think that's everyone."
Caleb Martin for Cody Martin
I think Caleb Martin will impress under our development
"So many takeaways. Not just what Lowry does for us, but it feels like all our young core players got better.  * Bam, Tyler, and Duncan all got bigger and faster * PJ feels like Ariza and Iggy combined into one person * Probably too early to judge but it seemed like Max Strus and Gabe Vincent (and maybe even KZ) took steps, though Gabe still needs to rein in those turnovers  And these two impressed:  * Caleb Martin. I didn't even know we had this dude, apparently we two-way'd him in mid-September. I don't know if his game tonight is representative of what he can usually do, but he showed out * Omer Yurtseven. He played his first NBA minutes tonight. In just 14 minutes he got a team-leading 8 rebounds. He's still green and made all the typical rookie mistakes like too many fouls and low shot clock awareness, but he absolutely did his job and filled his role"
This is tough but   Shelvin Mack Caleb Martin Cody Martin Johnny O‚ÄôBryant  Miles Plumlee   It‚Äôd be some really awful ball lol
"Caleb Martin balling out, always love to see either one of the twins doing that"
"If Caleb Martin scores 50 points, I will cut off three toes with a rusty pair of tin snips."
Caleb Martin is starting an NBA game. Say it ain't so.
"Dort is a fan-favorite starter. Caleb Martin is a two-way player whom the majority of NBA fans haven't even heard of, and 90% of those who have probably wouldn't be able to tell whether he's his brother. Stop acting like a crybaby wanker with a persecution complex."
"If it was preceded by Bam, Tyler, and Duncan continuously not putting in the effort needed to win, so much so that he took Caleb Martin, KZ Okpala, Omer Yurtseven, and Marcus Garrett in practice and bodied the shit out of the aforementioned starting players, and then those players didn't have an ""aw shit he's right we gotta be better"" moment but just doubled down and got defensive and called him a locker room cancer?  I would then say ""Damn Jimmy deserves better"".  Thankfully I don't have to worry about any of that in Miami as they all feel the same way as him and care more about winning than their fragile egos."
Very interesting to see how close some brothers are on this graph -Jaden and Jalen McDaniels and Cody and Caleb Martin.
He's better than Malik Monk and Caleb Martin so that's also why they have gotten better this year
Warriors fans are so salty about Kelly. The narrative is messed up. Hornets clearly need him just because he's not Caleb Martin. Having his depth and length has been crucial this season and helped more than it's hurt. Sorry Warriors have some weird complex bc he cost their owner $80m and they got nothing for him.
"The Martin Twins were kind of like that. Cody could D up, Caleb could score but both sucked when they were together. Cody has actually become fairly good this year, but now Caleb is with the Heat.  They wore 10 and 11"
"Cody Martin. Him and his brother were the worst guys in our rotation last year but now that we cut Caleb, Cody is absolutely shining. Lock down defender and he developed a pretty good handle and jumper."
"The best dunker in the heat is not bam, just cause he‚Äôs tall doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs got the best ability. Caleb Martin is actually the one that has the best hoops"
"I think when we have everyone but Dipo healthy, Spo will mainly have a 9 man rotation, with Herro/strus/kief/Ded off the bench and Caleb Martin as a defensive weapon sprinkled in occasionally. But when Dipo comes back, idk what you do cuz he‚Äôll for sure need minutes, but I don‚Äôt want strus to not get minutes. I guess we just rock a 10 man rotation and ride hot hands each night. The depth is honestly better than I was expecting this year"
Why did Caleb Martin take so long to pass that?
"The martin twins were verrry hit or miss last season. Just watching them play, you can tel that they both have the skills and intangibles to become key role players on contending teams, but Cody is further along than Caleb"
All started because Caleb Martin missed two free throws.
Is Caleb Martin good? He doesn't put up stats but I see him all over the place
Was not aware that Caleb Martin played for Miami
"Yeah definitely improved but like u said not a solid go at the end of the game especially when he isn‚Äôt contributing on offense. I would go with Lowry, Herro, Caleb Martin, Tucker &amp; Bam but of course I‚Äôm only watching from my tv"
Caleb Martin better
Yeah so Caleb Martin and KZ Okapla time I guess
Okpala is garbage. Yurtseven played 5 minutes and Caleb Martin is getting minutes over Desmond so it isn't looking too good.
Butler was injured. Struss was injured. Apparently Spo didn‚Äôt trust Caleb Martin and Gabe Vincent has issues. I think the Heat were forced to play Duncan when they clearly don‚Äôt like closing with him. I also think Spo made some rotation choices on principle. Like leaving UD in for 5 mins in the 2nd
That‚Äôs Caleb Martin music
"Heat‚Äôs depth worse than I thought if they gotta play Udonis Haslem, Caleb Martin and gave Vincent"
"KZ is crazy inconsistent. He is a three and D guy at best, who can‚Äôt hit threes consistently. Caleb Martin plays good enough team defense and has been pretty consistent offensively."
"This is the number one choice. Love the Heat, but not sure why this guy can‚Äôt get playing time even when half the team is injured. They bring in Caleb Martin over KZ Okpala? Wth?"
"Defense is looking great. Herro is being very efficient and getting 20.  Very solid bench minutes from Dedmon, Morris, Caleb Martin (replacing injured Strus in rotation). Faster pace with Lowry and better looks for the team. Team hasn‚Äôt found the rhythm from 3 yet. Duncan hasn‚Äôt shot well himself but I hope he hits 5 tonight on u guys lol   Heat have always been know for defense but the one improvement has been rebounding. Only outrebounded once this year (loss to Boston) where past few years we were bottom of league."
"* Bam rebound, gives it to Lowry. Lowry brings it up court, passes to Butler at the elbow, Butler takes 1 dribble and passes it to Tyler Herro who misses a three. Ball gets tipped to Bam who gets fouled. * Butler inbounds to Morris, who passes it back to Butler. Butler passes it to Herro at the free throw line who shoots a floater. * Morris rebounds, passes it to Herro (instead of Butler) to bring the ball up the court. Herro tosses it into Bam in the post. Bam throws a pass that gets deflected to Morris, Morris to Lowry, Lowry to Herro in the corner, Herro to Jimmy in the post, Jimmy to a cutting Lowry, who gets two free throws. * Lowry inbounds to Herro. Herro dribbles around until he shoots and makes a shot from the elbow.  * Lowry turns it over on the inbounds pass. * Ball inbounded to Herro (off camera). Herro turns it over with a travel. * Martin inbounds to Lowry. Lowry to Butler in the corner. Butler to Bam in the high post. Bam to Martin who misses contested three. * Inbounded to Lowry. Lowry and Bam pick and pop, Lowry passes to Bam who misses a free throw line jumper.  * Herro inbounds to Butler. Butler turns it over driving to the bakset. * Inbounded to Butler. Butler drives to the basket, passes to Caleb Martin who misses a wide open layup. * Inbounded to Butler. Butler drives and gets a blocking foul and gets free throws. * Inbounded to Bam who brings it up court. Passes to Lowry. Lowry to Butler at the top of the key. Butler drives and hits an elbow jumper.  * Inbounded to Butler. Passed to Herro. Herro dribbles and passes it back to Butler. Butler is stripped by Conley on the drive (should have been called a reach-in foul) and it ricochets off him when Mitchell throws it back inbounds.  * Inbounded to Herro, intentionally fouled for free throws. * Inbounded to Butler, intentionally fouled. * Rebounded by Lowry, passed ahead to Butler who has a wide open dunk but evades the defense to run out the clock.  So you found the following actions by Jimmy down the stretch to be problematic: a potential assist to Herro for a wide open three, an assist to Herro, a free throw assist to Lowry, a bad driving turnover, a potential assist to Martin for a wide open layup, free throws off a blocking foul, making an elbow jumper, a turnover by a bad no-call from the ref, intentional foul free throws, and passing open a wide open dunk to run out the clock."
What does Jimmy have to do with that? From when Butler checked into the game with 6:47 left:  * 6:32 - Tyler Herro missed 3PT Shot * 6:24 - Tyler Herro floating jumper * 5:55 - Kyle Lowry Free Throws * 5:20 - Tyler Herro jump shot * 4:53 - Kyle Lowry turnover * 4:18 - Tyler Herro turnover * 3:38 - Caleb Martin missed 3PT Shot * 3:13 - Bam Adebayo missed shot * 2:44 - Jimmy Butler turnover * 2:13 - Caleb Martin missed layup. * 1:47 - Jimmy Butler free throws * 1:11 - Jimmy Butler jumpshot * 42.9 - Jimmy Butler turnover * 17.6 - Tyler Herro free throws * 10.4 - Jimmy Butler free throws  Jimmy was in the game almost 4 minutes before he had a possession finishing action. A big problem with Miami down the stretch was that the offense wasn't funneling through Butler for large stretches of the 4th until he decided to take control of the situation once the lead shrunk very small.
"Caleb Martin has looked like a legit rotation player all year long for Miami, just saying. This is one of those cases where playing for a great team makes mediocre players look better. He's been a perfect unselfish role player for Miami."
Caleb Martin is making Eric Reed blush. Keep him. NOW.
Caleb Martin oh my god
Man that Caleb Martin layup was unbelievable.  The way the camera cut to his finish a little late was timed perfectly.  Almost looked mythical.  Need that shit to be on the front page of r/nba
"I‚Äôm ready to die on the hill that Max Struss is a real nba player and is going to be a huge addition to the bench. He always looks physically huge on he floor, his catch and shoot has proven to transfer to the biggest stage, he‚Äôs a solid defender, and he can move the ball with clear guard instincts.  And Caleb Martin is a good player as well. The heats bench was really underrated over the off-season"
Mr. Triple Double - Caleb Martin.
Or if we wanna rest Lowry. Dipo+Herro is much better than having to watch Gabe Vincent or Caleb Martin.
"yeah, a good way to put it in short is that you can either have Gabe Vincent and Caleb Martin playing NBA basketball in a Miami Heat jersey, or you can try out a fully rehabilitated Victor Oladipo and whatever that may entail.  it's not a fucking question"
"Because even if a player doesn't come back 100%, they're still back and healthy relatively?  We literally don't even need Oladipo and he's expected to come back and cook benches until he's ready to play playoff basketball, and we're not even over tax for having him while not needing him.  You trying to imagine a world where the Miami Heat somehow only get marginally better if not worse for replacing Caleb Martin with Victor Oladipo for 40-60 games is what truly takes an imagination."
Bro caleb martin been in the league 3 years
"He‚Äôll cut into some of that for sure, and now that looks bad sure. On a bad Herro shooting night, it‚Äôs much better for the team to have Oladipo out there than Caleb Martin. He‚Äôll bring up the defense of that second unit a lot and let Lowry rest a bit more id bet"
Might fall off in the coming weeks until Strus is back. Caleb Martin isn't matching Strus's scoring.
"He‚Äôs only shooting that match because he‚Äôs not on the court all the time with ball dominate players. He‚Äôs usually one of two scorers in the game him and Jimmy or him and Lowry. Obviously that‚Äôs when he‚Äôs going to look to score because obviously our offense isn‚Äôt running through Caleb Martin, Morris or Dedmond."
"I think depth concerns with this team are highly overstated. Herro, Dedmon, &amp; Morris all fill specialized roles very well. You saw last night that we didn‚Äôt have Bam and played arguably our best game. Strus got hurt last night but as a 9th man he was excellent, hell I‚Äôd say he‚Äôd be a rotational player on any team. Caleb Martin just needs to hold on long enough for him &amp; Dipo to come back and suddenly the Heat have a deep 10-man rotation for the 2nd half of the season, and a top-tier 9 man rotation for the playoffs."

Max‚Äôs injury looked more like an MCL or PCL than an ACL. Can be just as bad but I believe the recovery timeframe is faster. Either way he won‚Äôt be around for a while but Caleb Martin looks ready to play with our A-Squad.
"Maybe 88 games played in 1 season by Walt Bellamy because there is no way that can ever happen again. The 3 birthday thing is pretty much guaranteed to never happen again but there is still a chance! (Cody and Caleb Martin share a birthday with Juan Hernangomez, so it could happen!)"
