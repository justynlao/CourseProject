you sir are undervaluing marcus smart
"Jaylen  brown, Jayson Tatum, Marcus Smart, Kemba Walker, Fast PP"
"Jaylen and Jayson have 2 legit seasons. Peak IT lasted one year. Kyrie called it quits after one. Hayward was always hurt and took forever to rehab from the leg injury only to come back and get minor injuries. Horford was arguably the most productive over the longest period of time for us but his age was showing by the end of that 2nd season.   The timing for Cs has always been fucked post IT  1st season: Sign Hayward and trade for Kyrie, Jaylen, Jayson, Horford and Terry peaking in the playoffs but their out for the rest of the season.   2nd season: Healthy Kyrie next season, Tatum and Jaylen regresses while Hayward was obviously not ready and Mook and Terry on contract years.   3rd season: Signed Kemba to recover from losing Kyrie. Cs looking great. Hayward breaks his hand after running into Aldridge on a blindside screen. Hayward comes back looking good, reinjures his leg  4th season (current): Jaylen and Jayson are tearing it up. Kemba is out. Kemba comes back and looks like ass trying to play his way back. Jayson is out because of Covid. Team is finally all together. Marcus Smart is hurt now.  What can you honestly do? Ainge hasn't hit on the FA market in terms of role players so our bench has been beyond trash since last season. With the amount of injuries we have, its just been a killer."
"wow that is bizarre, I had no idea. His name sticks out so much on the list of most 3s in a game (also Marcus smart)"
"Dame, Westbrook, JB, JT, Kemba, Marcus Smart"
"&gt; Same with Marcus Smart, Patrick Beverley, etc  Except Lowry puts up all-star numbers lol. Back in the day when the Cavs used to be a thing, I would constantly say Lowry is better because he's Dellavadova if he put up Kyrie numbers (back then)."
Wonder when Boston fans will ever get over being jealous that the Raptors has won a ring  You literally cheer for fucking Marcus Smart.
Bruh you have Marcus Smart on your roster
Watching Boston - GSW game and man how good Jaylen  Brown and Tatum actually are. Also how bad Kemba Walker and Tristan Thompson play. It is a good chance using this two maybe even add Marcus Smart and maybe even draft rights to get a good big man. Then we might actually see Boston is one of the best teams in NBA
The Marcus Smart special
reminiscent of the marcus smart vs harden flop off from 2017-2018
Marcus Smart approves
man what the hell is marcus smart doing at #7. What was going on that he was taking so many threes
"Yeah, bringing up Philly when you have Embiid flopping left and right when matched up against dudes 80 pounds lighter than him is funny. CP3 is also super guilty, and Jokic is no stranger to complaining. And Boston has Marcus Smart.   With that being said, pretty much every single team has a foul-baiter or a massive complainer. It’s just a low-risk high-reward move, so people are going to exploit it until the league closes the loophole."
Lol cool of Marcus Morris to walk it up with 8 seconds left. Smart basketball
Have you met our lord and savior Marcus Smart?
Can’t be more painful than the time Marcus Smart was a hair away from death after an attempted murder on court.
This is how we Celtics fans used to defend Marcus Smart
"Lowry has always been the poster child. Love him or hate him you have to admit dude is like a combination between LeBron, Luka, Marcus Smart, and Harden in terms of working the refs."
"Lowry is the type of player you love if he's on your team and you hate if he isn't.  Same with Marcus Smart, Patrick Beverly, etc"
"Lowry is the type of player you love if he's on your team and you hate if he isn't.  Same with Marcus Smart, Patrick Beverly, etc"
He's better than Marcus Smart at his value. And I love smart.
Alex Caruso is white Marcus smart without the yolo
I thought that would be Marcus Smart on account of the theatrics
"As a blazer fan, he was always a 3/4 option offensively. Like Marcus smart, some games he goes off offensively but his main contribution is his defense and his ability to pass and hit threes"
Come on man. Isn't it obvious? He is marcus smart in a pf / c body
"I don't think people really think it's impossible for them to win together but you have to admit that he does have his faults. He was really bad in the Boston series and while able to slow down Kawhi a bit (he still averaged 36) he was a non-factor on the offensive end. Thats whats keeping him from the upper echelon of players. Yes you need other guys on your team too but you can't show up score 14 points and play great defence and expect to be called a star. Hell, Marcus Smart can give you 14, a few assists and play elite defence as well. I think there should be a higher expectation for Simmons. If he wants that money then show he's capable of doing more. He's not a bad player...in fact he's a great player, he has a lot of potential but he has very clear flaws in his game that would be better if addressed."
"I absolutely love Marcus Smart, he embodies what it means to be a Celtic maybe more than anyone else on the team right now, serious Paul Pierce era vibes — but even if he were out for the year, that wouldn’t be the end of the C’s season. To be brutally honest everyone has underperformed this year outside of the Jays, who are both certified world-beaters at this point. It’s looking like those are the only two indispensable players on this team right now."
"East: Lowry and Marcus Smart West: LeGM and Luka  LeBron would take the ball from the refs during last year's finals and hold it until he was done complaining, then they'd review the call  Luka broke a fucking sidelines tv for no reason"
Lowkey Marcus Smart before Marcus Smart
"Ngl I was devastated when I saw what happened to Pritchard but when Smart got hurt I was literally like ""eh he'll be fine, it's Marcus."" I just literally couldn't convince myself he was gonna be seriously injured lmao, Marcus is a dog man he's made of fuckin steel. And sure enough look at that. However I hope he does take it easy because IIRC this was how KD ended up with the achilles tear, coming back too soon playing on a weakened calf. Even somebody as tough as Smart shouldn't push his luck too far."
Patrick Beverley and Marcus Smart
I just don't like seeing guys get hurt man. I'm glad Marcus Smart is gonna be alright too. Almost thought it was an Achilles injury last night. 😩
We love Marcus Smart don't we folks?
Um Marcus Smart is out 1-2 weeks. Tf you talm bout?
Shams' random hatred of Marcus Smart is well documented
"From just an observation standpoint, smart seemed like he was in big pain and Kobe and KD didnt. Another big reason as to why it didn't seem like it was Achilles was because he didn't immediately grab it or his heel. Players have said that it feels like someone kicks your heel or steps on it. Marcus' injury seemed more like a cramp in terms of his reaction to it."
"Need a point guard that doesn't need the ball, tough on defense and can make shots. Perfect point guard for NO would be Marcus Smart. I'm not suggesting a trade for him, but that's the mold of pg I hope NO eventually ends up with.   Ingram and Zion are the playmakers for now. This team needs to build around those or they need to clean house.   In fact, what would someone say is the more important spot to find a better fit? Lonzo or Bledsoe?"
"&gt;Edit: Marcus Smart might be a better comparison.  A much worse Marcus Smart, you mean?"
I’d give marcus smart that contract right now but make it for 25 years. No I will not be taking questions at this time
"I’ll probably get clowned for this but, Caruso is like peak Draymond if he was a guard. He just hustles and makes opportunities. He’ll probably never give you 20pts on scoring but at least he’s hitting his open 3 pt attempts this year.  Edit: Marcus Smart might be a better comparison."
"Best coach is subjective, but I genuinely believe that he is a coach that maximizes his roster and gets players to develop. Jaylen Brown went from a guy who couldn’t shoot foul shots to a guy who is a knock down 3 point shooter. Marcus Smart went from a walking punchline to a solid defender and passer. Jayson Tatum has steadily improved. I mean, hell, Isaiah Thomas turned into an MVP candidate under him."
"Stevens offense is very sus imo  Too many ISO, Marcus Smart taking way too many shots, off ball movement and ball movement a bit lacking.   Excellent defensively though."

Marcus. Smart.
"Okay and Marcus Smart talks shit too, also KG, Pierce, and Rondo also. Talking shit is fun and apart of the game, it doesn’t make you a douche bag."
I’m sure we can find a Marcus Smart stat line that fits your needs.
"Agree to disagree. There are superstars, stars, season allstars, and high level players. Is your definition only playoff teams have superstars? Are they the only ones that elevate their teams that matters? Is Marcus Smart a superstar? Is Vucevic? Is Lowry a superstar during 2019? Superstars are the elite of the elite. Again, I fucking love Jimmy and he is an absolute winner, but he is not a superstar to me. Hope Heat get healthy and make some noise again, they are very fun to watch."
That's if Marcus smart is alright
"Still, Kemba is not an NBA title team PG. The bench still sucks. I'm fucking tired of watching Teague and Thompson. Danny just can't build a proper contender because he wanted to keep all of those precious assets. Now Smart has most likely tore his achilles. Fuck man. He's already been through a lot in his personal life, and now this. I feel awful. If it is an achilles tear, Marcus, please take your time. Don't rush back."
"Hell of a game, but god it just felt like the Hayward game after the Smart injury, really tough to get too invested in the outcome. Please be okay Marcus.        GG Lakers, lets do 7 of these later"
He absorbed Smart of Marcus power
"As much as I enjoy watching Boston lose, that Marcus Smart injury really sucks. Hope he's alright"
How is this up but not Marcus smart obliterating his Achilles?
Shams says Marcus Smart has a left calf strain
That's definitely not an Achilles. Probably a calf strain. Loved Marcus Smart since he was at OK State. Hope he'll be back soon
prayers for marcus smart that did not look good
Oh no Marcus Smart :(((. Grabbing that calf
"I know a lot of people hate Marcus Smart, but honestly he does a good job of being a physical defender while still being cautious. Been a couple times today where he fouls or accidentally trips someone and checks on them"
It's a weak record because all these 3PA/3PM records are going to beat pretty easily.   &gt;Not bad for a guy who’s outside shooting is his primary “weakness”  Marcus Smart is 5th all-time on Boston's 3PM list.
hmm might be a hot take but: Caruso &gt; Marcus Smart.
Marcus smart offensive development is wild from the rookie season.
Yeah it was! but without drafting dante exum instead of marcus smart. I dont know if we make the trade for jordan clarkson. so counter factuals fucking suck.
god to think the jazz could of drafted marcus smart...
Damn. Pippen looked huge next to guys his height too. He was jacked and just seemed to throw people around - and he only weighed as much as Marcus Smart does at 6'3.
Marcus Smart flops are the highlights I need
I’d give that title to Marcus Smart personally.
"""LeBron whines every play."" ""Marcus Smart oscar level flop."" ""ADs so soft smdh."" ""There goes that Tatum patented forearm shiver."" ""Kembas got crazy nice handles."""
How dare you insult Marcus smart like that
They can trade for Marcus Smart to complete the trio
i love marcus smarts game but its def marcus smart
Marcus Smart approves
Marcus Smart plays way above his size in the post. Hes gotten stops on embiid in the post doesnt mean Embiids weak.
"For sure, also feel like Marcus Smart is in there because of what he brings to his type of teams"
"James Harden, Trae Young, Marcus Smart  Every possession ez fts"
No worries. I'm all set for paying 20 million for Marcus smart minus defense anyway.
"You can, if you have all world Kawhi sucking up double teams and loads of attention. And yes for his size he is weak. He couldnt post up Marcus smart (a point guard) and has trouble bodying up any Forwards. Also he wasnt Raps second best player (Lowry) He was their 2nd highest scorer. Not difficult to score 22 pts/game when u are chucking up 20 shots a night."
"I like to think of him as a budget marcus smart. I think it’s going to be hard for you guys to keep him. A lot of teams will be interested in him, and I could see him getting 10m+ under the right circumstances."
"There's old saying:   ""You live by Marcus Smart, you die by Marcus Smart"""
Marcus Smart
Marcus Smart
Marcus smart
Kemba Walker....Marcus smart gets an honorable mention.
you spelt marcus smart wrong
"2021 celtics: kemba, tatum, jaylen brown, marcus smart  ^jk"
"I don’t know how anyone is a fan of Lebron James other than Laker fans. He’s a dirty player, cries about every single foul call, and flops worse than anyone not named Marcus smart."
"lonzo is just a c-tier marcus smart with better passing. worse shooting, worse defense. our backcourt would fall apart."
*Pre-2019 Marcus Smart in shambles*
JB is okay but my guilty celtics crush (pause) is Marcus Smart bc how can you not appreciate marcus smart
Marcus Smart starting out a game 2/2 from 3 is the most dangerous player in the league  ^^^^to ^^^^his ^^^^own ^^^^team
"I don’t think I dislike any active player anymore. Like, Draymond and Marcus Smart rub me the wrong way, but I appreciate their hard-nosed, do-it-all play. That’s as close as I get to “hate” these days."
"Marcus Smart had a very good shot opportunity, and is also very good at 3 point shooting off a pass. Maybe it would've been a better play to pass to Brown but I ain't faulting that play at all."
"Take off the green tinted glasses. Two guys complain, sometimes? Ok man. Not sure what team you are watching, but it apparently isn't the Celtics.  Every team has their group of complainers. Marcus Smart is actually one of the worst in the league."
Man fucking embid always takes his own feet out from under himself so he ends up on the fround like a dumbass. Hes like marcus smart
Marcus Smart an established flopper himself calls out embiid for flopping. Go figure
Marcus smart was definitely onto something
"The East wasn't bad that year. The Bucks had Giannis (2nd team All-NBA), Middleton and Bledsoe and lost to the Celtics without Marcus Smart.  The Sixers were favored to win the series against Boston and had Embiid in his 3rd year in the NBA and Simmons in his second year and were rinsed in 5 games.  The Raptors won 60 games, were top 5 in offense and defense and #2 in SRS and were swept.  Pacers were a 50 win team and led by Oladipo who was All-NBA and All-Defense that year."
"Bogdan Bogdanovic, if only for the confusion it would create with Bojan.  To echo, Nitro, Lu Dort would be a-frickin-mazing. Similarly, Marcus Smart would be cool too."
"Yeah I'm sure they're stopping the Warriors and Cavs LMFAO, Cavs 2016 only beat ""the best team of all time""***, Cavs 2017 was the best offensive of all time and nuked only lost one game before the finals in which Marcus Smart had the game of his career the game after the Cavs beat the Celtics by FIFTY POINTS IN A PLAYOFF GAME IN THE CONFERENCE FINALS, Warriors 2017 is literally the best team of all time, 2018 Cavs were a dumpster fire but would still beat the Wizards.  2018 Warriors were far less impressive than 17, but 100% would still beat the Wizards. Where would the Wizards win?   *** - before snek"
Marcus Smart
"OG even getting the ball in the first place was an absolute fluke if you ran that play 100 more times the raptors can’t even inbound the ball past the hash mark. Marcus Smart hit 5 3s because your team was incapable of guarding Kemba or Tatum, so they lived with Brown and Smart shooting wide open in the corner.   I just compared them. All that and Kawhi still chose them over sorry as Toronto 😭😭😭😭 nobody wants to play there."
Marcus Smart shooting 5 threes in a row in 1 quarter is the definition of luck. OG hitting a wide open three is normal.   The best regular season team of all time that blew a 3-1 lead won a championship the year prior. Don't ever compare the Clippers to them. They have never been out the second round in 50 years.
"Marcus Smart catches fire from 3 all the time, he’s a streaky shooter. Blame nick nurse for leaving Jaylen Brown and Smart open in the corner to stop Tatum and Kemba.   The best regular season team of all time blew a 3-1 lead, I guess they aren’t good anymore! LOL"
yea because marcus smart hitting 5 threes in a row in the 4th quarter was not a fluke at all.  The clippers  were so good that they blew a 3-1 lead too huh
"Marcus Smart ""I can't keep flopping like this. I'm getting old. I'm 27. Every play I flop flop flop""."
"If Marcus Smart was here, things would be MUCH BETTER"
Marcus smart has something to say about that.
Was that Tatum or Marcus smart out there?
Learned from Marcus Smart
Finals would be Marcus Smart vs Kyle Lowry every year
"Thybulle is a stud defensive prospect, his ceiling could realistically be like, Marcus Smart. Trading him for 32 year old Patty Mills would be incredibly short sighted."
I follow Boston. I am not frustrated by Marcus Smart.
Damn I’m actually surprised because I remember bos/wsh playoff series I felt like so many players like Avery Bradley and Marcus smart cutting to the rim because Wall wouldn’t guard that to save his life
"As a Jazz fan I'm sure you understand Rudy's impact WAY better than I do. But from the perspective of a coupe scenarios like this and the series with GSW (maybe this was regular season) stand out as hunting for guard on Gobert matchups.  The criteria for the award has certainly changed, not saying Rudy is undeserving in the slightest just that I wish some wing defenders would get looks. Marcus Smart, Ben Simmons, those guys."
Agreed bro I hate Marcus Smart because of it
"everyone who follows Boston knows that Marcus Smart is the most frustrating Celtics player to watch.  More ""was"" than ""is"" as much anymore.  But he would hero ball all the time in crunch time despite being the worst high volume shooter in the NBA"
"Bro I agree it’s stupid, it’s just ironic that a Marcus Smart flair is the first to point it out"
Lol Marcus Smart flair ignoring bad defense
I would guess that means the untouchable Marcus Smart would be gone in order to acquire either of those two.
Marcus Smart needs to make this list. I can't stand that motherfucker and I curse him every time we play against him but dammit would I love that dude on my team
"I completely disagree. I wish the refs would tighten up. Watching players jaw at the refs all four quarters really takes away from the game in my opinion. The Raptors are unwatchable. Nurse and Lowry are insufferable with the refs. Hell, I'll even throw Marcus smart in there. I wish the refs would slap a T on him every now and then."
Marcus Smart flair 👀
I have no opinions as to whether or not Marcus Smart is ass but appreciate your thoughts on the matter
"Joel ""Patrick 'Rasheed Wallace' 'Kyle Lowry' 'Marcus Smart' Beverly"" Hans Embiid"
This just makes me think of all the money Marcus Smart saved by getting injured
"Joel ""Patrick 'Marcus Smart' Beverly"" Embiid"
"For ex-NBA players - Adam Morrison was confirmed stinky that he used to empty locker rooms.  I bet Zaza was pretty bad too.  For current guys, I think Marcus Smart"
"&gt; like dFG% doesn’t incorporate the fact someone like Simmons is typically facing the other teams best offensive player.   It does though, that's why it shows the dFG% relative to the average the player is defending..  If Simmons is defending Marcus Smart and holds him to 35% he is basically holding him to his average so it shows that, if he defends Jokic he holds him to 50% he actually is not doing good"
6th man gotta be Marcus smart
I don't think Marcus Smart or Aaron Baynes have ever missed against the Sixers.
"Remove Semi from that list, he did his best to throw away this game in the final minutes with his horrible defensive awareness. Dude legit has one of the lowest defensive IQs I've ever seen, he literally can't do anything other than body up stationary players or maybe take a charge once every couple games, for which it's like 50/50 whether it'll be a block or not. Dude needs to be off this team ASAP, he is like the anti Marcus Smart where it's the ways he *hurts* the team the most that don't show up on the stat sheet."
Brace yourself for the Marcus Smart come back comments soon if he underperforms.
It holds true in the regular season but it's a different story in the playoffs. When Marcus Smart was a worse shooter he'd get closeouts in the regular season but dudes would sag off him in the playoffs
I love Clint Capela so much what a valuable selfless player. like a nice marcus smart
Marcus Smart flopped so Lu Dort could fly
"Marcus Smart missing games, Kemba not playing well, losing Gordon Hayward, and having lackluster production at the 5."
- Tatum hasn't been able to shoot since getting COVID  - Kemba came back and has played like Lou Williams instead of Kemba  - Marcus Smart has been missing for awhile now and our defense has gone to shit  - Our bench still sucks
"Could you imagine a team with the Jays, Hayward, Kyrie, and prime Horford? And with guys like Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris, Aron Baynes, Daniel Theis, and Robert Williams coming off the bench? That team would win at least one championship"
"Chillll guys, they missing Marcus smart"
Do you hate Marcus Smart too?
"&gt;Simmons is really the worst defender for Luka (or best if you’re a 76ers fan) not only is he elite, but he’s actually bigger and stronger than him, which is why he’ll still give a guy like Marcus smart or even Kawhi (they’re the same height) problems. Add in embiid’s elite defense around the rim, which the clippers didn’t have last year, and yeah.  This is spot on.  Even if Luka gets around Simmons, Embiid is there at the rim to shut off any easy finishes.  Plus that interior defense means that everyone else on the Sixers has the comfort of not having to sag off their guys which cuts down on Luka's ability to drive and kick.  Only way Mavs stand a chance against the Sixers is with a healthy Porzingis so you can drag Embiid out of the lane on defense.  I don't think it should be surprising to anyone that one of our big runs (and best offensive series) in the game came in the 3rd quarter when we put Maxi in at the 5.  But that meant that we had to use Maxi in the post against Embiid and couldn't have him defend Simmons, which he was very effective at early on in the game."
"and Marcus Smart, who is the heart &amp; soul of the team."
"Simmons is really the worst defender for Luka (or best if you’re a 76ers fan) not only is he elite, but he’s actually bigger and stronger than him, which is why he’ll still give a guy like Marcus smart or even Kawhi (they’re the same height) problems. Add in embiid’s elite defense around the rim, which the clippers didn’t have last year, and yeah.  Sorry, I didn’t mean to make this about the clippers, I just remember last year that they were our worst team because of Kawhi, PG, Beverley, Morris, and Mo Harkless"
"I've been saying that the issue is Ainge.  His overall drafting and acquisitions have been atrocious.   I look at the teams that are contenders.  They have their superstar(s) but the also have good/great supporting cast and depth.  What I see is their players are athletic, have length,  good ball handle handlers and great-good rebounders and their players have a combination of these things. I look as our roster and dont see anyone with the above mentioned except maybe Robert Williams. Ainge got rid of Kanter and even Poirie(sp) so now we get bullied under the boards.   He wanted more versatile 5s then decided to get Thompson who is average at best.  He put on too much weight and lost his leaping ability.    We could have gotten Christian Wood for cheap!!!! Imagine getting close to 20 points from him and 10 rebounds? Also,  he can spread the floor.   I think Montrezl Harrell was a affordable contract.  He's a bad man, a Marcus Smart type with more size.  I think I'd rather have him than Thies(sp) or Thompson.  We could have gotten Dwight Howard,  Javale McGee cheap and Whiteside for nothing!! Rondo would have been better than Teague and if Ainge had the foresight,  he would have gotten D. Rose from Detroit.  How come Ainge cant find the Browns(Nets), Caruso(Lakers) and other so called no-name players who are playing lights-out????  Speaking of foresight, he drafts Grant William's and Carson Edward's but the are sitting or not being the kind of contributors we need.  We let Max Straus go he he's playing well.  What about drafting Neismith but haven't been giving him time to develop? We could have gotten Bey and we also gave Memphis Bane who has the best 3 point percentage of the rookies.   Tatum and Brown are good-great players at times but they are too young.  Kobe needed Shaq he got really good, where the y just needed to surround him with the right roll players.  I think we miss Hayward more than we think.  His years of experience plus the ability to give us 20 points at any night is a plus.  Kemba is going down hill and doesn't have the explosiveness quickness like J. Morant or Fox.  He's a defensive liability and that's bad for a team known for defense.  We miss Horford and also Crowders tough ess.  We have 2 choices.  Either chalk this year and play the young guys so they have experience and also to see who they should keep. Second,  they can make some moves like sending picks and players to get someone who can contribute more than what we have.  Would it be possible to get Rose and Knox for Kemba, Thompson or Thies and our trade exception?   What about 2-1st rounders,  Kemba and Thompson for Turner and Warren?     Steven's can do better but he's dealing with the hand Ainge gave and continues to give him.  Gros said sometime ago that he would go over the luxury tax to be competitive.....well, let's see if he's serious"
Wym he was actually doing a Marcus Smart impersonation
"I mean no one thinks he can score currently, but he’s still one of the best passing big men currently and a pretty good to great defender even if he’s not in the running for any award he is still super valuable to the Warriors. The closest comparison would be Marcus smart for him and his value to the Celtics."
"I'm sure nephews will say he is overrated, and maybe he is...But that dude has a crazy ceiling if he can be healthy. I believe that and his defense were the only reasons why he got drafted so low. I dunno, I hoped the Celtics would roll the dice and trade up for him. He'd be that perfect second scorer to Tatum imo. Jaylen is amazing too, but them 3 boys would be fun to watch grow together. Add a Pritchard and a Marcus Smart, Robert/Grant Williams, maybe a bench Boogie, Anyone left over on the roster ... baby you got yourself a stew to compete w the Nets.  Who am I kidding, that shit will never happen :(  But Siakim is Jaylen 3.0 so y'all should get Harris and a 1st imo at the minimum on top of MPJ. Not bad value, maybe will need to add another asset to make it work, but I want y'all stupid teams to work together to bring down the Lakers. (Go LBJ/AD, but fuck the market power of L.A)"
"J.J. Redick is the only guy I'm sure is leaving. Zo, idk.   &gt;*Zion needs vets IMO. You can't just can't surround him with rooks. He deserves to compete.*  I'm with you 100%!!!! We really need a Harrison Barnes/Marcus Smart guy who just helps their younger teammates get into position on the court. A lot of our mistakes are just young guy mistakes."
marcus smart - everything
"Really? Man. In the bubble, I remember Marcus Smart did that a couple times to save possessions for the Celtics."
Marcus Smart and Kyle Lowry in shambles
Wow the disrespect  Marcus Smart wouldn't let Donte DiVincenzo cook him.
Marcus Smart plays defense. Bledsoe does not.
Bledsoe is Marcus Smart being given Jrue Holiday responsibilities
Marcus Smart has clamped Porzingis. Simmons can't guard 5s lol.
"The roster isn't good. We have the Jays, Kemba with shredded wheat for a knee, Marcus Smart who thinks he's Steph, but doesn't realize that he's not Steph, and the rest is literally a college team.  Ainge has absolutely shit the bed. Some want to fire Brad, but I think he's just been given an untenable roster situation, and now the cracks are showing.  Since KG left, our centers have all been bargain-bin/draftee 6' 8"" guys ""with upside"" who blow harder than a nun at a tractor pull.  And all r/bostonceltics wants to do is ""Trust Ainge""!   It is *infuriating*."
Hey my answer was gonna be Marcus Smart and Marcus Smart.
"That's nothing, Marcus Smart can hit a shot from anywhere so long as he's flailing, off-balance, flopping, and has his eyes closed"
"As much as I love him, Jaylen Brown has become overrated a little bit. I've seen a lot of people saying he should have been the only all star on the Celtics or saying he's better than Tatum, hell i've seen ppl say he's better than Beal. Still a great player and deserves to be an all star but slightly overrated now.     On the other hand Marcus Smart is incredibly underrated. All Defense 1st team, legitimately great playmaker, and he's actually a decent 3pt shooter. One of the best deal in the league at 12m per year too."
"That's not how things work at all.  VanVleet just got re-signed after his contract ran out. DeRozan only ever signed his rookie extension with us then re-upped after the contract expired. The last time Lowry was signed we waited until the contract ran out. In fact that last person I can think of even for the Celtics that re-signed with them excluding rookie extensions is Marcus Smart, a PG who waited until the offseason when his contract expired to re-sign with the team.  With that said, Lowry got an extension at the start of last season, so I do believe he's ineligible for an extension right now (but I could be wrong)."
"I'm a simple man, I see Marcus Smart praise and I downvote it"
"Believe it or not, Marcus Smart."
Marcus Smart will always and forever be underrated. We always talk about how the box score doesn't show the full story or even half of it......but when it's time evaluate talent all we do is look at those same 5 stats.
"[This video is an amazing breakdown of AK47 and how his game would translate to today’s.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XGkSph7VDrU)  Idk about DPOY because he wasn’t a center/rim protector, but hed be an advanced stats god. He’d be incredible at handling switches.  He’d be like a longer Marcus smart with a much better offensive skillset"
I'm a simple man. I see Marcus Smart I upvote
I think this is one of those cases where its just as much about the guys filling in as about who is missing. It doesnt seem like Marcus Smart should have this big of an impact but when his minutes are going to the likes of Aaron Nesmith and Tristan Thompson it makes a little more sense.
We just aren’t a contender this year. Our ceiling is a 3/4 seed and Marcus smart is the difference between being that type of team and being under .500
"You are confusing naming a person's abilities and flaws with double think.  &gt; Brown and Tatum aren't superstars, YET.  It's not double think to say they have potential, but aren't there yet.  &gt; Marcus Smart is a defensive god  Not at all what I said. I said he was a leader, but bad on offense. Again not double think.  &gt; Kemba will be awesome when he's not injured.  Didn't say Kemba would be awesome. I said ""idk"" what he will be. Again, not double think.   &gt; Ainge is the best GM in league  Nowhere did I say this. I didn't even say he was a top 5 GM. I didn't even say he was a top 10 GM. I said he constructed some good rosters, but hasn't the past couple of years.   You may need a dictionary and reading comprehension lessons."
"It's also an ""exponentially easier for small people than large people"" move due to size and leverage. Marcus Smart can kip up, that's the only clip of an NBA player doing it I can find.  I did find another clip of [Steven Adams jokingly failing to do one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ay1GL__-1L4) though.  Interestingly enough, there are clips of The Rock doing them, so it's not impossible for larger folk."
"You gave answers about how each of those people are potentially the amazing whilst begrudingly admitting they're not. You're still doing the double think and you don't even notice you're doing it.  Brown and Tatum aren't superstars, **YET.**  Marcus Smart is a defensive god.  Kemba will be awesome when he's not injured.  Ainge is the best GM in league but only had a couple of little blunders, poor baby.  etc etc etc.  You can't help it because you don't even know you're doing it."
If Marcus smart picked up smoking he would be eligible in Massachusetts
"Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Marcus Smart and Kemba are all the future GOAT or Ainge can't construct a roster? Which is it? You can't have it both ways.  According to Celtics fans your players are both simultaneously the best in the league and the roster isn't good enough and it's all Ainge's fault."
"Hard disagree. Jayson Tatum is 22. We lost a lot of talent value-wise with Kyrie walking out the door and being replaced by Kemba, whose injuries have seriously hurt the team (plus Marcus Smart being injured). Give Ainge the offseason to reset the team. If that fails, then maybe you can begin to consider a coaching change. You don't fire a coach that's taken you to the final 4 with a young roster 3 of the last 4 years"
I think he did it in the bubble after someone(Marcus Smart? Oubre?) successfully did it and it went viral on sports pages
Marcus smart da real MVP
Marcus Smart rolling in his grave
"As much as I love shitting on the Celtics, Marcus Smart has proven he's the most important player on that team. Not the most talented, but definitely the reason they pull through in tight games. He doesn't provide the scoring Dragic or Herro do (although he's getting more reliable) but his defense is immensely better than Bradley's.  Heat still better tho."
"It’s only been effective at reducing the absolutely insane flops, like the Marcus Smart flops. But it hasn’t reduced the small everyday flops that players can easily get away with."
"No.   In this past three seasons, here is the extent of the flopping fines:  20-21 - Marcus Smart  19-20 - Marcus Smart and Pat Beverley  18-19 - Nobody  This list is way too short to indicate the NBA actually cares."
No it's like calling both marcus smart and marcus morris marc
"Your take is ridiculous when you look at his coaching history.   He coached a starting lineup of Rookie Smart, Avery Bradley, Evan Turner, Brandon Bass and Tyler Zeller to 40 wins.   The next year was IT, AB Crowder, Sullinger and Amir. Three of those guys aren't even in the NBA anymore. That team won 48 games.   They won 53 and the ECF the next season by replacing Sullinger with Horford.   Then they went to the conference finals with Rookie Tatum, 2nd year Brown, Scary Terry, Al Horford, Marcus Morris and Marcus Smart. And they were minutes from the finals. They went through Giannis/Middleton and Embiid/Simmons."
"&gt; they have enough  They have Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, neither of whom are high enough level ball handlers. Kemba Walker is a shell of his former self. Marcus Smart is out for a while. The rest of the team is very one dimensional and there's like one role player shooter who defences actually respect."
"When did I say that he wasn’t a really good player? Marcus Smart is a really good player, Terry Rozier is a really good player, you don’t even make sense."
"I don’t care what anyone says, Marcus Smart has the best “AYEE” in the league"
"Lost Hayward, Kemba is cheeks, Danny made no moves aside from getting a nearly washed Tristan Thompson and a completely washed Jeff Teague, no Marcus smart. Roster full of bums outside of 5 guys."
"They really need a primary playmaker to let Tatum and Brown flourish. Hayward was that guy when he was healthy, Kemba probably isn’t that guy, too score-first. Marcus smart back will help though"
"This is definitely worth pointing out. Poor Milwaukee doesn't seem to have a scheme answer for us, but we got a Sixers game without Embiid, a Celtics game without Marcus Smart, a Clippers game without Kawhi or PG or Batum, the Lakers tonight without AD, etc. Doesn't mean we haven't beaten some solid teams but a few of the top dogs were missing a piece or two."
"-Marcus Smart is the spiritual leader, defensive tone-setter, and best playmaker on the Celtics, losing him has been absolutely massive as you said.  -We’re trying to work Kemba back into playing shape but he’s been very inconsistent and our depth at guard is not good. Pritchard was a nice find but every other guard we have is undersized and shouldn’t be on an NBA roster. we all complained about Wanamaker last year but Teague makes him look like Magic Johnson  -Behind Brown and Tatum we have no depth at wing at all. Grant Williams and Semi Ojeleye are like carbon copies of each other: undersized, dense, not very athletic, inconsistent shooters. I’ve actually liked Nesmith’s effort the last few games but he’s not ready to play significant minutes, and our lottery pick Langford from last year hasn’t even touched court this year due to injury, and really so far his whole career has just been marred by injury  -Our big rotation is actually pretty decent between Theis, Williams and Thompson. I’d say Thompson hasn’t been great though, and the double big lineup we keep running is..very meh.  -Tatum and Brown have gotten flack for ball hogging but they create lots of open looks, team just isn’t converting. Which eventually leads them to force the issue and just make SOMETHING happen  Overall it’s a lot of problems and it’s mainly roster construction. There are only 6 players (Brown, Tatum, Smart, Pritchard, Theis, Rob Williams) that are definitely worth keeping around long-term. It’s crazy how fast we went from having one of the leagues most stacked rosters two years ago to this"
r/nba bouta let the “Tatum shouldn’t have made the ASG” hot take chopper SING  but yeah we suck lmao. I miss Marcus Smart
"I mean, Tatum had COVID and several other players missed time due to health &amp; safety protocols as well.  Plus Kemba missed the beginning of the season and is still working his way back.  Payton Pritchard had an MCL injury.  Also Marcus Smart tore his calf and has missed a huge chunk of the season.  Dallas might've gotten more wrecked by COVID, but not like the Celtics have had perfect health either."
They are arguably worse with Kemba. Marcus Smart has been the true loss
"Geez, wtf happened to the Celts? I know Marcus Smart is an important player but there's no reason for them to be struggling THIS much. Hoping they get their shit together during the 2nd half of the season"
"Boston fans have to accept the fact that Kyrie was not the issue in 2018/19, nor was Rozier. Notice how neither Horford nor Hayward wanted to stay in Boston despite its ""bright future"". The issue was always that there is a locker room cancer in our core, namely Brad Stevens, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and Marcus Smart.  Smart has been out for most of the season, so it can't be him. I have been a vocal proponent of firing Brad Stevens, but we cannot rule out the possibility that Tatum and Brown do not like each other."
Any Celtics fans wanna chime in on why the Celtics are struggling recently? I know Marcus Smart is injured but there gotta be more than that
"They were also some potential trades involving the Lakers core and picks, and a couple others that were better. The Tobias trade is better. Marcus smart plus multiple picks is better IMO. Covington Saric and multiple picks is better IMO. McCollum would be better if available (and would be added a couple of picks)"
"bro he's bad, but we also have kyle lowry on our team who is probably some player's worst nightmare on a switch.  and neither of them are anywhere close to marcus smart."
"The lottery ended up being pretty booty, but aside from all stars in Embiid (3), Randle (7), LaVine (13), and Jokic (41), the draft also had numerous starters or major role players: Aaron Gordon (4), Marcus Smart (6), Elfrid Payton (10), TJ Warren (14), Nurkic (16), Garry Harris (19), Capella (25), Bogdan^2 (27), Kyle Anderson (30), Joe Harris (33), Dinwiddie (38), Jerami Grant (39!), Dwight Powell (45), Clarkson (46!), and the legendary Thanasis Antetokounmpo (51)."
"Kawhi fucked the spurs hard. Some other offers the spurs got were Tobias Harris and pick 13 and 14. Marcus Smart on an 18M/year contract and picks. Covington, Saric, and a few picks. There wasn't even any word from the blazers on them being willing to trade McCollum."
"That I’ll agree with- depth is a real issue on this squad.  It gets pretty desperate when we go 7-8 deep on our bench.  But suggesting we can expect this kind of lack of production just because we’re missing our 4th best player?  Nah, man.  We should still be able to beat the likes of Detroit and the Wizards without Marcus.  Plus- those stats about our 4th quarter woes cover the entire year, and Smart has only been out a portion of that."
"In a way it kind of answers the question of how the Celtics can be underperforming while still having two insanely elite players in Tatum and Brown  Both are so gifted physically that they can beat almost anyone straight up, but the ball just stagnates a lot because of the inability to create space with baits and counters and the distribution troubles (brown more than tatum).  It's why to me Hayward was so important even hobbled, he is really good at spreading the ball around even when he's offball to create a lot of ""hockey assists"". Combine his absence with Kemba's injury issues and Marcus smart being out and you get a whoooooole lot more stagnant on offense. Boston's currently 28th in team assists."
"There was a play I think in the 3rd quarter where Powell grabs the rebound, dribbles out of traffic, and while he’s getting out of dribble position Thanasis comes up behind him and bumps in to him, then flops like he got blasted by a shotgun. He got called for the foul and you can hear Luka yell “quit flopping!” It was like the third time that quarter he tried that Marcus Smart shit, paired with all the jawing he was doing I think Luka was just over it"
"They're the type you hate but love if they're on your team. Like Montrezz Harrell , Marcus Smart."
Marcus Smart: “Am I a joke to you?”
"i think there's quite a few like that who put in 100% effort every game. caruso comes to mind, marcus smart. they don't have the skill of westbrook but they're always trying."
Thanasis must have been watching Marcus Smart highlights
Marcus Smart suffered the same calf strain injury in January  that AD had. Came back in March I think and has been good since then.   AD will be back by the end of the month. Bron had a high ankle sprain in late March which typically take 4-6 weeks Bron will be back early May.   The lakers should be good for the playoffs
What you're saying isn't exclusive to Marcus Smart tho. Why are you picking on him in particular?
deandre jordan is a (former) all-NBA member AND is a perfect salary match in a trade who would provide Boston the defensive anchor they need in the paint not to mention he hustles on every possession. tbh we're OVERpaying for marcus smart
Marcus Smart for Jell Embed?
You are now picturing OP aggressively setting up a circle of chairs for discussion while staring at you and saying “Let’s talk about Marcus Smart.”
Marcus smart is the eastern conference Draymond green a good general lithmus test for someone and their ability to analyze the game comes through what they think of him
"Yeah he kinda reminds me of a Marcus Smart type player, a valuable role player to have. He’ll improve any team he goes to but he won’t be the star."

Marcus f’ing Smart hitting big shot after big shot  Man.
Marcus Smart heart and soul
"He’s always picking off passes and is very active on that end of the court, he gives shades of Marcus Smart level hustle at times imo."
"No. Seeing Rondo in purple was hard enough, not Marcus Smart please."
For 46 mins I could give a fuck about Marcus Smart...   The last 2? You need to clamp him like he’s fucking Steph.
Or Marcus smart
Like Marcus smart at the end of the game
Marcus Smart:  Shoots 1/10 from 3 and played only 8 minutes due to foul trouble.  Also Marcus Smart:  That one make was a buzzer beater to win the championship.
Simultaneously surprised but not that Marcus Smart won the game on two threes made.
TIL Marcus Smart is the Will Barton of the Celtics
Team just needs a change. Marcus smart gotta go.
Marcus smart is good
"Thank you, ofc he flops a bit, I can't point a player who doesn't, but people act like he's peak Marcus smart level or James Harden."
We'll take one Marcus Smart please and thank you.
Marcus Smart thinking this is his team and constantly losing games late in the 4th with selfish hero ball antics. He’s a role player.
Ok how the hell can you blame Marcus Smart though. Is he supposed to teleport
That have Marcus Smart. The identity is flopping.
"What did Danny Ainge do wrong?  - Kyrie / Rozier - Smart / Brown - Tatum - Hayward / Marcus Morris - Horford / Baynes when he was good / Theis  What is particularly wrong with that roster? You wanna say ""thin at wing"", well, yes, but Tatum averaged 30 and Brown and Hayward averaged 25 minutes each, so it's not like they were hurting for depth either."
Marcus smart vibes for sure
"Same story as 2019, the Celtics made the ECF the year before and they play with this arrogance and selfishness. Marcus Smart no doubt played well in the playoffs last year but the Celtics need to still prove they are that good."
"The secondary players will all be on the perimeter so they won't really gave to do anything but shoot open threes. If trapping him worked, you would have seen the Clippers do it more last year and even this year when we played them. He's too good of a passer. The best way to play him is to be extremely aggressive (like how Marcus Smart was in 4th quarter when we played the Celtics) and try to get him frustrated."
Didn't forget marcus smart hero ball
Marcus Smart duh. It’s in his name! Lol
Marcus Smart was very disappointing. Only one flop.
"He embellishes calls like a guard. Kemba threw his head back on every contact, Tatum got a foul on a 3pt with no contact because he complained loudly enough, and Marcus Smart played. Embiid hits the deck a lot because he was told to in order to avoid landing awkwardly. Centers are generally worse face up defenders and Embiid abuses that by playing like a guard at times. And when he plays like a center, he can power through doubles or back down the defender.   Jokic not getting calls isn't Embiids fault. Stop hating"
&gt;I don't think Marcus Smart can guard Embiid in the post.
"Sixers have better role players than they used to have with Danny Green and Seth Curry; Harris is playing much better under Doc. Celtics really don’t have a replacement for Hayward. Their bench lacks scoring (maybe Fournier can help) and then Marcus Smart has been taking WAY too many hero shots as well as making dumb turnovers. I think with Rob Williams and TT healthy they have the talents. But Kemba and Smart have to play significantly better. Brown and Tatum, but mostly Brown have to be more consistent stars and then Fournier and another player need to step up as scorers for them off the bench."
Like Marcus Smart?
Marcus Smart
Marcus Smart
What was with the party early on where the narrator says a tweet by Embiid about working with Aaron Rodgers at practice or something was a direct shot at Marcus Smart and he says he will tell us why but then just goes into a story about how Smart's brother died for bone marrow cancer?  He never explained why that tweet about Rodgers was a shot at Smart.
"Well obviously, you can read right? The difference is I have numbers to my support my argument where as you don't.   Also It's better to have a higher number for an offensive rating and a lower number for a defensive rating, so Fox doesn't have a better offensive rating than Booker who beats him quite convincedly in both categories. How are you going to call it a ""noisy metric"" when you don't even understand how it works?  According to defensive ratings, Marcus Smart and Kyle Lowry are having the worst defensive seasons of their entire careers. Smarts defense has been criticised this season (he's missed 17 games through injury and probably isn't 100%) and Lowry is 35 years old so not an absolute shock to be honest. Jaylen Brown is a very overrated defender. Refer to this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mcn8yw/is_jaylen_brown_an_overrated_defender/). Their are even Celtics fans who are saying his defense has been bad this season. Do your research."
Who watched the secret base video about the beef between Marcus Smart and Joel Embiid?
"You would then absolutely lose, have you ever seen NBA players shoot 3's in practice, if left uncontested, even guys like Marcus Smart drain 80% of them."
"Doing more than 10 because I want to:   Jrue, Dort, Ben Simmons, Giannis, Gobert, Marcus Smart, Bam, OG, Draymond, Embiid, Mikal Bridges, Kawhi, Myles Turner, Dejounte Murray"
Turns out Avery Bradley and Marcus Smart are pretty good at defense
Marcus smart when we need a basket
"They had a good run of this for years. Like 2015-18. IT4, Jae Crowder, Marcus Morris etc all left better players than when they came in. Jays and Smart in the draft obviously   Don’t think it’s been as good lately and it’s frankly one of the things holding them back this year they don’t have enough good players"
"Marcus smart for the Celtics. I get that he’s a great defender, but I hate watching the decisions he makes with the ball in his hands. Everyone in Boston loves this guy and he continuously misses pass opportunities and takes ill advised shots. I just can’t believe someone that holds the ball so often can be allowed to make such bad choices without being benched.  Edit: spelling error"
Marcus Smart getting injured screwed you guys up big time. He’s like a mini draymond and provides all the energy for your team
"These are the guys I consider to be the elite elite defenders in the league. Could be missing a couple:  1. Ben Simmons 2. Rudy Gobert 3. Draymond Green 4. Anthony Davis 5. Giannis Antetokounmpo 6. Bam Adebayo 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Jrue Holiday 9. Marcus Smart 10. Jimmy Butler 11. Lebron James 12. Mikal Bridges 13. Joel Embiid 14. Robert Covington 15. DeJounte Murray 16. OG Anunoby 17. Myles Turner  I think Marcus Smart has been tangibly worse this season and couple of those next 5 guys have been little better, but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt."
Marcus Smart is arguably the best post defender at his position
"Marcus Smart for D, JJ Redick for 3"
Marcus Smart
Plays a lil more like Marcus Smart tbh but not a bad thing
"When Marcus Smart does this, we’re all like: “Why’d he do that?”"
Marcus smart would be proud
"It's like if Marcus Smart and Josh Jackson had a child, and only taught it to flop."
Whatever. If that was Marcus Smart and not Neto that’s getting called 100% of the time. Refs let reputation dictate a lot.
The Marcus Smart paradox.
"Miami maybe, they have some tools but i dont think they have the same firepower as the Sixers and Bucks to combat the Nets.  Would not be surprised to see them excel though.  but the Celtics are in no position to face the Nets, or any of the top 4 this year tbh.  They're just not good this year, even when theyre healthy.  Not only do they not have the defensive personnel to stop the Nets big 3 (let alone the Bucks and Sixers regular-sized 3), I doubt they have the offensive personnel to even compete with the Nets.  Aside from the Jays, who can you rely on?  Marcus Smart?  Kemba?  I just dont see it"
"Who? And why? Which team needs a ball handler that cannot shoot, and is basically a no factor in a halfcourt offense? His only plus attribute in the playoffs is his defense and age.   Would you give up even 2 for Marcus smart a few years ago? He was on a much better contract as well. One way defensive guys aren’t that useful unless they are big men.  There is no team that is giving up 3 picks for Ben Simmons."
If so I hope Marcus Smart gets well soon
"but he also said floor.  you can't just make a floor-ceiling comparison with an archetype.    I could be an MJ-type player but if I am 5'6"" with a 10 inch vertical and my jumper broke af, then my floor is gonna be pretty low.  So I'm assuming that a player roughly equivalent to Marcus Smart is what OP meant his floor was"
I wonder what the 5 year plan for Marcus Smart looks like
"Marcus Smart. Don't get me wrong, I love Smarf and everything he brings to the team, but coming out of college people were comparing him to Dwyane Wade. He's made improvements as a shooter, but overall he's just not a good scorer and likely never will be"
Hampton had a great game and had just injured his ankle. Kid's floor is a Marcus Smart type player and his ceiling is substantially higher than that.
"You’re right about Jaylen being a number 1 option, he’d probably struggle although with seen flashes of him becoming an elite scorer (e.g Philly) and good playmaking (throughout this season he’s improved dramatically). Let’s not forget that Siakam has plays with Lowry, FVV, OG and Norm/Trent Jr. Jaylen has played with JT, and regressing Kemba and a cold Marcus Smart.  Also, we’re talking about drafting players. Considering upside is huge factor in drafting there’s no way you don’t take a 24 year old JB doing what’s he’s doing over Siakam rn. I know development isn’t linear but I’m taking Brown every time."
We have Marcus Smart on a fucking bargain contract so you're not gonna hear me mocking teams for paying top defenders
"i always look at it like if shooting, passing, finishing, defending, size, athleticism, etc are all 1 point, and you reset everybody to 0, guys like Lebron, CP, Marc Gasol, Marcus Smart, etc. would still start at 1 because of their IQ. it’s one thing where if you can’t contribute at all physically you can still be a net positive on the court  if Marc isn’t hitting or contributing he will find somewhere in the scheme to get an opening for somebody."
"Argentina beat USA with a team that had basically no NBA players in 2019. I'm not sure how many players exactly in their team is in Euroleague now but I'm sure it'll be somewhat competitive. For reference here's the team USA squad that year  &gt; The official 2019 USA World Cup Team includes 2016 Olympic gold medalist **Harrison Barnes** (Sacramento Kings); **Jaylen Brown** (Boston Celtics); **Joe Harris** (Brooklyn Nets); **Brook Lopez** (Milwaukee Bucks); **Khris Middleton** (Milwaukee Bucks); **Donovan Mitchell** (Utah Jazz); 2014 World Cup gold medalist **Mason Plumlee** (Denver Nuggets), **Marcus Smart** (Boston Celtics); **Jayson Tatum** (Boston Celtics); **Myles Turner** (Indiana Pacers); **Kemba Walker** (Boston Celtics); and **Derrick White** (San Antonio Spurs).   Not great, but still respectable. If we are going by the worst of the NBA, e.g. Rockets, I think that Euro will win."
Marcus Smart fo sure
I keep thinking that Mike Scott is Marcus Smart in a Sixers uniform with that hair
"Yeah, LeBron or Doncic aren't getting pulled for a couple of midrange pullups but a guy like Marcus Smart might.  Plus, these guys are all release valves, meaning they're taking these shots when they get any type of decent look, especially towards the end of a shot clock. They work for the first 17 seconds then LeBron throws up the best he can with 4 seconds left, even if it's a midrange jumper."
(Most times) Marcus Smart
"Plus TJ Warren is out for the season, Marcus Smart missed like a month, KAT was out for the first half of the season and then DLo's been out since, Shai's gonna be out for at least another couple weeks, the Orlando Magic have lost all of their point guards, and that's not even counting injury-prone guys like Embiid or all the guys who've been out for COVID protocols/actually got COVID themselves."
I hate Marcus Smart so much but if he was on the Sixers I would love him
"Mathews only have troubles against ***very*** quick small guards, can be easily solved.  Caruso is 6'4, how many bigger SGs are out there?  Gasol is playing like 15 minutes per game, and a team can't just abuse secondary attacks on Lakers, it's just impossible.  Morris has a similar build as Lebron, 6'9 245lb. How many bigger while more athletic guys are out there?  No shit, he is a point guard lmao, even Marcus Smart would get expose when switched to bigger guys."

"I think it comes down to whether this season for the Celtics was a bump in the road or something more permanent. The Celtics already have their superstars and don't really have the flexibility to surround them with much more in the near future. It comes down to Tatum and Brown's development.   &gt;OG’s extension kicks in, GTJ is worse than Powell and is an UFA. Stanley Johnson is an UFA too.   OG's extension is $18M AAV for 4 years. Considering the improvements he makes every year, that's hardly crippling. GTJ will get somewhere around there as well most likely.   Let's assume the salary cap stays is around $110M for the next 4 years (itll probably rise), $36M for 2 guys 22 who for arguments' sake at least have higher ceilings than Marcus Smart is very ideal.   Neither FVV nor Siakam are untouchable. They will have another year off their contracts, making them easier to trade.  The optimism comes from the fact that the Raptors have the chance to get high picks in consecutive years to get their 2 stars (like the Celtics did with Brown and Tatum). And if we do get a star player through the draft, the supporting cast is ready made with the potential to be a lot better than what the Celtics have surrounded Brown and Tatum with."
"&gt;I actually looked at PGs per/year salaries and at $12m/yr he would be in the range of Clarkson, Pat Bev, Patty Mills, Cory Joseph, Marcus Smart, Dinwiddie, and Exum. I would see him settling in this range well. Smart/Clarkson would probably be the only guys I would take over him in this range, all things considered.  Just posted, but peep this list to see where you think he would slide in [https://www.spotrac.com/nba/contracts/point-guard/](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/contracts/point-guard/)"
"Oh I think his value to the team is immense, but the Mavs would be stupid not to listen to offers it they can get a legit two-way starter out of him.  Just looking at him as an asset, he is already 24. Will be 25 at the start of the season. His game isn't reliant on athleticism, so I could see his game maturing well into his 30s. You have to also take into account the Carlisle bump that a guard takes in his system- whether you believe it or not, it has proven to be true 80% of the time.  I actually looked at PGs per/year salaries and at $12m/yr he would be in the range of Clarkson, Pat Bev, Patty Mills, Cory Joseph, Marcus Smart, Dinwiddie, and Exum. I would see him settling in this range well. Smart/Clarkson would probably be the only guys I would take over him in this range, all things considered."
MARCUS SMART YAM THAT
Marcus Smart needs to keep playing like he has tonight until Brown comes back (which is hopefully soon). Less shots and more playmaking/defense.
"The more important takeaway from this game is Marcus Smart.  We are getting playmaking/defense Marcus Smart, and not selfish Smart. I hope this continues."
Nah he doesn’t lol Kevin Porter missed 1 shot and said “This isn’t the G League anymore” He hits a euro on Marcus Smart a couple plays after and gets salty
Marcus smart is smart af and dumb af all at the same time
See if Marcus Smart can break 40% from the field.
"I question the Marcus Smart thing because there’s no way that good a defensive player could have that bad an offensive IQ.  Don’t get me wrong, he’s really bad, but he isn’t, I dunno, Kevin Knox. Smart does understand some basketball."
"Hayward started 18 of 80 games that year (includes playoffs) . He moved to the bench role before thanksgiving   I’m not saying you’re wrong, but I really hope the players didn’t have a huge falling out of a really talented team for this reason alone.   I thought brad was very proactive in that situation too. Remember he benched Hayward and Jaylen for underperforming. And even thought Marcus squared and rosier weren’t initially starting, he gave good minute distributions.  This was opening night. Kyrie, Jays,Horford, Hayward, Smart, Rozier all got 25, plus 20 for Baynes and Morris  https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201810160BOS.html"
Marcus smart
"Lol  Worst team in 2007, won championship in 2008.   Drafted Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown.  Built a team of Kyrie, Jaylen, Hayward, Jayson, Horford, Smart, Marcus Morris, Rozier"
I see that Marcus Smart rubbed off on him
"Just because it was the de facto Jordan strategy and it ultimately was more positive than negative does not mean it was the ideal way of playing defense.   SG's weren't asked to be rim protectors just like Josh Hart or Marcus Smart aren't, but that doesn't mean that it wouldn't be very helpful if a SG had the size and knowledge to make a quick rotation and elevate for a great contest. That's in fact a reason why Jordan had more defensive value than smaller guards, because he could do that to a better degree than other guards with less vertical pop and size.   There are massive differences in schemes, but I think you're not looking at his defense vs. others with close enough of an eye. Lebron was not only able to take on more defensive responsibilities Jordan simply can't, but he also orchestrated the defense and played in some incredibly complex schemes that required far more communication than in Jordan's time. That to me is a clear step up from what Jordan did."
Marcus Smart might have been thrown threw the stadium wall if he was ever hit that hard.
marcus smart
"Youre' getting downvoted but that's a pretty reasonable take honestly. The 2017 and 2018 teams should have been the pinnacle of the Celtics rebuild and they actually had solid depth and a championship roster if they stayed healthy. Losing Horford, Irving, and Hayward only to be replaced by Kemba and the growth of Tatum/Brown isn't quite enough to compensate, and the bench definitely took a hit.   I'm optimistic that a healthy core of Tatum/Brown/Rob Williams is a very strong team. Neismith and Pritchard are promising depth pieces (potentially starter material for Neismith if he can continue developing). Decisions will have to be made for Kemba and Marcus Smart, but they're both solid players to work with."
"That's fair, but even then DPOY tends to go to rim protectors.  Perimeter guys need to basically have insane defensive seasons and hope that there aren't any insane seasons from rim protectors (or no good narratives, anyway) to win the award (see: Kawhi a couple seasons back).  So like, if next season say... Marcus Smart has an elite defensive season but so does someone like Myles Turner, odds are Turner would get the award because DPOY just tends to go to the big men.    Perimeter defenders are generally at a disadvantage, is I guess what I'm saying."
Yeah I seen that shit too many times as a Raps fan. Raptors been on suffering end of Crowder's shooting streaks too many times when he was with Celtics and Heat. We know him. I hate him and Marcus Smart for that reason. Usually ass but then they get into a zone against Raps. That's how Celtics beat us in playoffs. Smart shot over 40% from 3 against us LOL. In other series he was like 32%.
"Look up ""Marcus smart lady crossing the street"""
God bless Marcus Smart. That hit completely fixed Jimmy's 3 point shot!
"i mean i wouldn't call him *soft* but he does flop like a 7'0"" Marcus Smart lmao"
"I was bummed because I wanted Marcus Smart in that draft, but happy with Randle. Felt he was too raw back then.  Damn…time flies"
Marcus Smart
Ben Simmons?  PG: Ben Simmons / Malcolm Brogdon Marcus Smart  SG: Terry Rozier / Alec Burks / Buddy Hield  SF. Mikal Bridges / Norman Powell / Gary Trent Jr  PF: OG Anunoby / Jerami Grant / Marcus Morris  C: Myles Turner / Nikola Vucevic / Jakob Poeltl
"&gt;I can tell that you have a poor understanding of basketball because you think that Marcus smart is going to command FVV money. FVV as a combo guard is a borderline all star.   Well we both agree that Boston won't spend that kind of money on Marcus Smart, but unfortunately you don't seem to be aware of what his market value actually is. FVV and Dennis Schroder are very good indicators of what the market is gonna be for Smart. The fact that Boston won't pay that much (just like with Hayward and Horford) is why he'll walk (just like they did), but Smart will get those kinds of offers.   I wonder if you'll think back on this in the future when all of this happens and will think to yourself ""wow, that guy was correct."" My guess is you won't, but instead will be like ""it was smart of the Celtics to not offer Fournier that kind of money!"" You know, just like you did with Horford and Hayward. And then you'll repeat the same process the following summer with Smart when he leaves for greener pastures. It's just what you guys do, no matter how many times the same situation plays out. You think you guys would learn, but apparently not."
"Ah yes the terrible, healthy in the playoffs starting line up of Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward and Al Horford with Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris, Daniel Theis, Aron Baynes and Robert Williams of the bench 3 years ago. A 4-1 loss in the second round is all that could be expected of such a subpar roster. PJ Dozier on a two way then"
Marcus Smart was a good pick. He's a solid player so not a horrible pick.
"The only lottery pick of their own that they used was Marcus Smart (6th Pick, 2014).  Since then, they’ve made the playoffs each year."
Marcus Smart is the issue. He can't shoot and the defense doesn't have to respect him.
"Huh? Lol Nah this ain’t it.   Tatum and Brown ALONE should be better than a 7/8 seed. Then add in Kemba, Marcus smart, Fournier, Tristan Thompson… The GM has done his job this ain’t no G league roster they are more then equipped. They just got hit with injuries   Where Ainge deserves criticism is for not capitalizing on their crazy amount of assets and folding them into another star and making Boston a juggernaut. They’ve had like 5 mid to late round first round picks which have turned out to exactly what mid first rounders do, role players. (Grant Williams, Langford, nesmith, Pritchard) . That’s way too many guys like that on 1 team, especially one trying to win now. Also let Kyrie out the building, Hayward walked for free, didn’t go after harden, AD, etc  But not becoming a juggernaut is a far cry from ‘they have a g league roster’. They have finals caliber talent just injuries have hurt and yea coaching. I made a thread very early wondering why/how the Celtics were starting two traditional centers in 2021 I was utterly baffled. That’s 100% on the coach.  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ltd2ca/waitthe_celtics_start_theis_and_tristan/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf"
"Disagree.    * Kemba doesn't have the worst contract in the league, first of all, he's been playing very good lately.  * Secondly, they have three young players who are looking really good developmentally (Timelord, Nesmith, and Pritchard) and could grow into great starters (combined with Jaylen and Jayson, that will potentially be a great starting line up in a few years). * They own all of their picks.  * Marcus Smart can bring in a good return.  * Also, this isn't a first round fodder team, this is a second round team when healthy, and a dark horse ECF/Finals team depending on player development."
"&gt;- The Celtics have the 6th highest payroll in the NBA next season, not including a new deal for free agent Evan Fournier    So... why does this mean a bleak future?   &gt;- Kemba Walker has one of the worst contracts in the league    There's only 1+1 left and he averaged 19, 4 &amp; 5 this year, after starting really slow from injury.   &gt;- Most of their young players like Grant Williams and Romeo Langford have disappointed    Tatum, Brown, Williams, Pritchard, Nesmith haven't disappointed   &gt;- They own no future first round picks from other teams    So... they don't owe anyone any picks. Why is it bleak to not own other teams picks?   &gt;- Marcus Smart will likely have to be traded this summer or else the Celtics tax bill will be massive. And if they don't trade him, they certainly will not be able to sign him to a big new deal next summer when his contract ends.    Why can't they pay him? Why does he have to be traded?   Also, if he's traded then it won't be for nothing. They will get value in return."
"I agree to an extent, but that doesn’t answer the question. Unless your contention is that Marcus Smart  would be as destructive as Giannis?"
Drummond at 22 and Marcus Smart at 114 makes me a tad suspect of these rankings.

look at all of these laker alumnus around the league that a lot of nephshites on r/nba were saying were trash. I remember a thread where people asked whether you would rather have marcus smart or randle in 5 years about 3 years ago. I was laughed out of the thread for saying there is an argument for randle.
but does he &amp; marcus smart scissor
Wait a minute is this one of those Marcus Smart games...
"**First Team:** Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert.   **Second Team:** Marcus Smart, Jrue Holiday, Kawhi Leonard, Mikal Brudges, Joel Embiid.  Honestly, I really considered going the ""cheating route"" of using Bam and Embiid as ""forwards"" to include Bam and Myles Turner. Shout-outs to Clint Capela, Matisse Thybulle and Paul George too."
"Well if you asked this around 4 years ago the Celtics were the #1 pick for this question.   That roster will be a conundrum for people in the future  &gt;Kyrie Irving &gt;Jaylen Brown &gt;Jayson Tatum &gt;Gordon Hayward  &gt;Al Horford  That’s just insane considering the role players like Marcus Smart, Aaron Baynes, Daniel Theis, Terry Rozier, and Marcus Morris. They also had draft picks galore, a great young coach, and solid management.  The point is it is a lot harder to win irl than it is on paper, and it’s hard to forecast the future.  Can’t believe that got fucked up so hard in so many different ways."
It’s really not. Marcus Smart at his best is a slightly better Patrick Beverley. No advanced stats back up the assertion by a diminishing subset of your fan base that he’s a winning player who’s invaluable to the team.
"They probably should have sold high on Marcus Smart and not let him expose himself as a mediocre offensive contributor. Squander the talent maybe no, but squander the asset, definitely"
"C's still have all of their draft picks, young players showing promise, Marcus Smart, Rob Williams, and an 11mil TPE to work with to try to make something happen."
Marcus Smart has a unique last name
"He doesn't have any value, his contract is albatross. It's better for the Celtics to keep him and probably trade Marcus Smart"
"You know thats not happening, dude is letting it fly. If people thought Marcus Smart was frustrating."
"During every single interview Towns is saying how wins are important for the next season, praises coaching stuff and young players, mentioning how he wants to build his legacy with this team. Can he request a trade in a year if everything goes wrong? No doubt. Is there a possibility of him being traded this off season? Not even a little. Better not to post your trades around Wiseman or Marcus Smart."
"We’ll give you Marcus Smart, Rob Williams and 3 firsts"
JaVale McGee  Tyler Hansbrough   Marcus Smart
"Marcus Smart, Payton Pritchard, Semi Ojeleye, Grant Williams"
He just needs to go out there and do Marcus Smart things.
"Rob already is an athletic freak, is the thing. Man has a 40-inch vertical as a center, and his height isn't so much of an issue because he has the same wingspan as Joel Embiid. If anything, I'd be worried that giving him any more athleticism would tear his body apart, he's already so injury-prone.   ...6'6"" Marcus Smart is basically prime Draymond, though, so you might be onto something there."
"Celtics aren't playing as well as they should be this season, but both the Js and even Marcus Smart just steps it up during the playoffs."
"The difference between those teams and the Knicks is that the Knicks were projected to be a bottom 2 team going into the season, and there was also a consensus that the Lakers got even better. However, considering you have a Mavericks flair, you might just be a tad salty that your team lost two 1st round picks to give a max to an injury prone 7'3 stretch 4 that got pushed off his spot by 6'4 Marcus Smart because of his lack of strength, nor the composure or skillset to use his height to shoot over the top of him"
The fact that Marcus smart got ejected for hitting a guy in the dick because of a moving screen last week this is way more intentional and a dirty play.
Marcus Smart would go 1/10 from 3 but the 1 would be a game winner.
"Skill boost: Rob Williams. All the physical tools are there and then some, if he had a jump shot and some polish to his game it'd be over for the league.  Height boost: Kemba Walker. Pretty self-explanatory, the guy's height is an issue on both ends.   Athleticism boost: Marcus Smart. Yeah, he's already insanely strong for his size, but he's not especially explosive for an NBA point guard. If he were able to power to the rim like Westbrook, even if it's not quite on *that* level, you'd have one of the best two-way guards in the league even with his streaky jump shot."
Eghh.  Marcus Smart is really feast or famine but you have to admire his confidence to continually put shots up no matter what.
Yeah Marcus Smart grazed Nurkic’s nuts trying to get over an illegal screen (which was called) in what looked like far more incidental contact than this recently but he got a tech and was ejected immediately. There was a lot of confusion about that though
"I think this is basically how they handle people getting hit below the belt now. They ejected Marcus Smart for hitting Nurk is the balls a few games ago as well. I understand that they're trying to promote safety and clean play, but I feel like this kind of contact is almost always incidental."
Prime Draymond but right now I like Marcus Smart cuz I’m biased homer
"Marcus Smart is another example of that, dude was trassshhhhh from 3 the first couple season but now he's very respectable from there"
"Send CJ to the Celtics in a deal for Marcus Smart. Throw a bag at Danny Green, Andre Iguodala, and Richaun Holmes. Make some other moves with their younger guys.  Starting Lineup would be Dame, Smart, Covington, Holmes and Nurkic with Green, Iggy and Melo on the bench. Are they top contenders? No but defensively they are much improved."
Marcus Smart with 6 TOs...
Marcus Smart what the hell was that
"Oh boy, we gonna get another Marcus Smart going off in the locker room episode? I love those"
Marcus Smart is the only Celtic who seems to give a damn.
"Marcus Smart is our leading scorer, that's the story"
i know marcus smart brings a lot of good but holy shit is he frustrating to watch
Over Marcus smart and turner ? Lol no especially not smart
OG and/or FVV should make it but games played might keep them off it  Edit: FVV has played more games than Marcus Smart so maybe not.
"LeBron and Schröder are flat out elite individual defenders.  They sure as hell deserve selections over Marcus Smart, Thybulle, and Turner..."
Shoot too much when cold: Marcus smart  Not enough when hot: Seth curry
"The problem with the Celtics isn't so simple as their bench is bad or whatever, it's that this was a poorly constructed team *for this season*. And by ""this season"" I don't even mean because it's a shortened year due to the pandemic, I just mean that Ainge constructed a roster that relies far too heavily on a bunch of young, untested players.   Some of their young players may be good eventually (I'm not talking about Brown and Tatum, who are already stars, I'm talking about guys like PP, Nesmith, Langford, etc), but it was silly to think they'd be solid, reliable contributors this year. They're young and inexperienced, so some nights they contribute, and some nights they don't. It's what young, inexperienced players do, and Boston has an unhealthy amount of those kinds of players in their rotation for a team that had pretty high expectations going into the season.   Because of this Boston just has a super top-heavy roster, and this is exacerbated by Kemba's inconsistency and even the sometimes questionable play of Marcus Smart, who can be great one play and head scratchingly bad the next. Boston really only have Tatum and Brown who they can rely on, and everyone else is some degree of a question mark. So they might get great supporting play one game and look fantastic, or they might get nothing from everyone else and they'll be bad.   This year the Celtics just needed a couple more guys in their rotation who were steady and reliable. They didn't have to be stars, but they needed people they could count on to bring the same game every night. That's doubly true in a season as unpredictable as this one has been. I'm sure Boston fans at this point probably just look at this as a bit of a lost year but try to focus on how the young players might be good in the future, which is totally valid. But for this season, this was not a very good roster construction job by Danny Ainge."
Paid too much to Marcus Smart. You don't spend that much on backup point guard
Marcus Smart has taken that role this year.
Draymond Green and Marcus Smart have entered the chat
"Dude every dude in the C’s locker room hangs out with Marcus Smart. They also talk to him on the bench, have gone to movies together, race to pick him up. He also threw chairs at them in the locker room. One incident doesn’t prevent the team from liking a player."

We could have nets like NFL kickers use.    I think Marcus Smart would be the guy to propose to one.
"Danny Ainge, the guy who assembled the roster of Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker (who was coming off a starting all-star season when we signed him), Marcus Smart, Robert Williams, Evan Fournier, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, and Tristan Thompson? one of the most solid and YOUNG 9-man rotations in the league? there are problems with this team, and none of them are Ainge"
"Marcus 'Not So' Smart keeps missing, but he just keep firing away. What a bum."
Marcus Smart is a personal favorite flopper.
"It's a complex combination of shit luck and poor roster construction in my opinion.  2018-2019 was the high point with that stocked roster. But, Kyrie's headcase and Gordon snapped his leg. There was also the issue of too many mouths to feed with people like Marcus Morris and Terry Rozier wanting their touches.  It was the right move to make room for both of the Jays to be the face of the team moving forward but I still think Ainge has done a poor job constructing a roster around them. For the record I'm on board with not trading either of those guys for a superstar rental, but on the flip side Ainge sat on his hands with all of the draft assets within the past few years and doesn't have much to show for it.  A common retort I've heard from Celtics fans is, ""Who could we have traded for?""  To the Celtics defense, the roster construction over the past few years has not lead itself to making any impactful trades. Kemba is a bad contract, the Jays are untouchable, Smart is probably untouchable and while Theis massively outperformed his contract they traded him at the deadline just to get under the tax. That being said, this can all be pointed at as bad roster construction.  If we want to look at it from a hindsight prospective, we can easily see that if Rozier and Morris were causing locker room issues they should have been traded instead of letting them stay until the offseason. This was also a time with both the Sac and Memphis pick had more speculative value than they'd actually come to have - what I'm getting at it is the Celtics could've gotten somebody who fit the system better / more draft assets.  Also not to shit on Kemba but once has to wonder if they took that max money and signed some cheaper, more complimentary pieces. Ricky Rubio went for 17M/year for example. You could've gotten him, a good sixth man and another complimentary guy for the price you paid Kemba. That would've also let to having more trade-able assets down the line.  As I mentioned, this is all hindsight too but if you were going to sign Kemba Walker and put yourself into a position where you can't effectively salary match (which doesn't go well with the fact that they had a warchest of draft picks and untouchable players) then the least you could've done over the past few years is draft older, more complimentary guys that were ready to contribute immediately next to your core.  Brandon Clarke, Matisse Thybulle, Desmond Bane - all players that Ainge either missed out on or literally traded away.  I'll give credit where credit is due - Payton was a smart choice in that vein and I'm willing to give Nesmith the benefit of the doubt as I think he has a great ceiling of a 3&amp;D wing.  And don't give me shit about Romeo Langford not being ready - I've watched him since IU; can't shoot for shit and can't stay healthy. I get that it's been a rough season but the dude is looking like Kris Dunn right now. Bust potential"
"as a rockets fan, i can tell you tony brothers did not like us/harden.  that famous marcus smart flopathon against harden at the end of that one game was tony brothers making the calls."
Is Marcus smart a high level playmaker? Genuinely don't know tbh.
"Kyrie had Bron and Marcus Smart to do playmaking for him.  KD played with Steph, Dray, and Russ.  Those two have always had some form of high level playmaker on every contender they've played on."
"&gt; Sometimes they even reacted to absolutely no contact, but the league did crack down on that  Feels like the league has nearly stopped issuing any kind of punishment for this. There's been **3** flop fines issues over the last 3 seasons. Marcus Smart is 2 of them."
Marcus Smart
"Marcus ""Most three-pointers in game by a Celtic"" Smart says hello"
"The Heat. Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown, and Jayson Tatum feels way more scary to face when hot."
marcus smart
Despite what the box score says I am absolutely confident that Marcus Smart has never missed a three against the Sixers.   The numbers are lying.

"In the alternate timeline where he would up in a sock we have world peace, a cure for cancer, and Marcus Smart shooting 40% from 3"
ill go marcus smart
"he's good on top of a zone for sure but he's not someone like Marcus Smart who could be stuck on a big and help on a drive and protect the rim, as well as being too small to pick of a lot of weakside passes.  don't get me wrong I love Fred and he's one of the smartest players in the league but at that end of the day he's very undersized and it kills him at times."
"First of all, we are arguing semantics...I said if Gobert is your primary player, the team would be bad..I was referring to primary offensive player since thats what people mean 99% of the time when we talk about team's best player. I don't agree with you that he is the Jazz's best player, I think Mitchell is, but you're free to think that he is.   Second, how the hell do you have any statistical basis for saying he is having a top 5 individual defensive season ever when its widely known defensive stats are terrible for tracking that type of thing? For the best advanced defensive stats I know of (DPM, DWS, Defensive rating), Gobert is no where near the top of the list of historical seasons for any of them.   [DPM Best Seasons](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/dbpm_season.html)  [DWS Best Seasons](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/dws_season.html)  [Defensive Rating](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/def_rtg_season.html)  &gt;Regardless of his individual offensive limitations his skills have translated to consistent, winning basketball and have allowed the Jazz to build a consistent, winning system around him.  He is surrounded by a deep, talented, well coached team..and has been for most seasons of his career...idk how you feel like you can just pin that strictly on him, he is a complementary player and clearly not your best player...nor would you be able to build any successful team with him as your best player.   You probably think Marcus Smart, Jrue Holiday and other defensive specialists are the best players on their teams too...I guess someone should tell Giannis and Tatum that their bum asses are being carried."
"not sure celtics have that much talent outside of tatum, even if he is all nba caliber.  kemba gets hurt a lot, jaylen hasn't made the leap we expected, marcus smart is good at what he does but he is kind of a role player"
"People talk about Dejounte Murray like he's amazing on defense and while he does play amazing defense occasionally, for the most part he's average to slightly above average. Just the last game he played, he was constantly letting Joe Ingles blow by him. Guys like Marcus Smart, Ben Simmons, Jrue Holiday are far better defenders than him."
"Marcus Smart, and would probably make it too bringing him to a total of 1 for 9 on the night"
"Celtic’s depth has just been bad especially at the PF position so that’s all he’s been playing his career.   PG: kemba, PP  SG: Smart, Fournier, romeo   SF: Brown, semi, neismith  PF: Tatum, grant Williams, Jabari  C: TT, rob Williams, Kornet  Before this year their best PFs have been, theis (horrible 2 big experiment that failed), Hayward (natural SF as well who had to slide to the 4 at times), Marcus Morris, semi, yabusele."
"Yes, I’m very self-conscious about his long free through routine and this triggered me. I’m just glad he’s not a serial flopper like Marcus Smart"
"That’s 2 MVPs of the recent 4. You would have said Beard would be Bradley Beal at most after watching his rookie season on the bench and Westbrook would just be a hustler like Marcus Smart after watching his rookie season as well. That’s 4 of the 4 recent MVPs who you think wouldn’t be superstars after watching them as rookies.  If you’re not expecting any of the MVPs to be superstars then there’s something wrong with you. Lol. You’re just a wrong hater. Look at yourself.  Oh btw, Beard and westbrook also had worse rookie seasons than LaMelo. Just to show how much of a hater you are."
"He is 3rd for total deflections by a guard according to NBA.com/stats, behind FVV and TJ McConnell. He is also 5th for deflections per game behind Marcus Smart, Jrue Holiday, TJ McConnell and Fred VanVleet. If you consider Jimmy Butler a SG instead of a SF that pushes Thybulle to 6th."
"Every good defender handchecks, people think that handchecking is banned and the 90s only did it  Kawhi, Jrue, PJ, Marcus Smart, literally handcheck everything and they don't get called"
"What? Miamis core clearly is stronger and Boston clearly also. I would take every day in the week Tatum, Brown over R.J and Julius Randle and quickley still has to prove that he is more valuable than Kemba and Marcus Smart. He has a long way to go to do this!"
"There are players who individually are better at the game of basketball than others. They can pad some box score stats. Whether it be low basketball IQ, inefficiency, laziness, selfishness, etc. it’s not better for the team as a whole. That person can still be better at the game of basketball than someone else. Just not a good teammate. Marcus smart can score zero points and impact the game more than someone who can score as a role player.   Rondo isn’t seen as better than most PG’s, but wherever he goes teams seem to play better with him (when he tries). Dude is playing what 15-20 minutes per game? But making a massive impact while scoring minimally.   KAT can’t win for shit (I understand the team isn’t very good), but his numbers are always amazing. But he’s ranked as one of the best centers in the NBA despite him not impacting or elevating the play of the four guys around him. He even acknowledged that he needs to learn how to win and not just get numbers. I’d rather have a few players over KAT, right now, despite his overall ability to score being better than theirs because they impact the game by simply existing the court with higher BBIQ."
"Bro nba.com ranked Durant the better player. That means that harden isn’t unequivocally the better player. Idk what to tell you. I give harden the edge cause at least we’ve seen him ball out with no help. You’re arguing against yourself.   But if you want to deep dive into it, yes that can exist. Marcus Smart isn’t better than most other role players but he may impact a win more with non box score stats."
"&gt;tell me that you base your opinion solely off of box scores without actually saying it  I’ve watched a few Celtics games and outside of the beginning of the season when he was working his way back from injury, he’s pretty much been the same all star he was last year.   The Celtics employed a 2 big lineup for most of their season and his p&amp;r stats probably look worse, but once they shed theis they have looked a lot better on offense.   Paying him 30 million for next year (and this year) is not really the Celtics concern imo. It’s probably that they don’t have a way to replace his production when he walks in 2 years unless they feel that marcus smart can become a scorer."
"Anderson was a borderline all star type - like a really good 3rd or 4th option on a team, probably not a great thing if he was the 2nd option, which he often was.  Stoudemire, aka mighty mouse, was pretty impressive - think isiaiah thomas if he never hurt his hip, but also playing in a much less offense-biased era.  One of the all time greats at hesitation and change of speed moves.    Jiri Welsh, was mostly forgettable.  I remember the name, can't remember the face  Doug Christie was a shit on the court and also had a really weird homelife too if I recall.  Dirty mofo, excellent defender type, like marcus smart, or a way more offensively skilled Bruce Bowen.  He was more point guard than shooting guard too, which helped free up bibby to be their go to clutch shot maker.  Guy you'd defend to the death if he was on your team, but holy shit, he was annoying.  Rick Fox once punched him - it was even better than Rondo punching CP3.  Olowakandi is the worst 1st overall pick ever, worse than bargnani, even worse than Anthony Edwards.  And before anybody chimes in with some random stats nonsense, they never actually saw how toxic and pointless his stats were on the clippers.  Hilarious that you have him down as the C from Minny."
"In a game, I saw Harden elbow Marcus Smart directly in the face, barely flinched. End of play, Marcus collapses from a brief brush with another player. These guys are experts."
"Let’s put him up there with Patrick Beverly, Marcus Smart, Andre Roberson, Hassan Whiteside, Avery Bradley and Andrew Bogut since were handing out flowers for SIXTH PLACE FOR DPOY."
Clarkson is Marcus Smart like. Either goes 10-10 or 0-20
Ah.. the Marcus Smart trip dub
Damn. Marcus smart level flop
We call it the Marcus Smart
Marcus Smart is at least a threat to shoot and get hot. Ben couldn't score if he had current Isaiah Thomas on him lol.
"Honestly, Marcus Smart is such a better value to teams. He's not on a max contract and will never be and he's actually capable of shooting threes and free throws. He also improved from being terrible behind the arc to be at a minimum, average. He has an extremely high BBIQ, defends 1-5, and can run offenses on a third of the salary. Every team would pick Smart over Simmons right now. Simmons has shown he will never evolve, he has over a hundred million reasons why."
Marcus Smart will shoot even if he's averaging 30% from 3. Last year he hit like 5 in a row in a big game against Toronto.
That's actually not bad.   On Boston - Simmons wouldn't be asked to score at all with Tatum/Jaylen taking over.   He'd be like a giga-Marcus Smart minus the heat-check 3's.
Honestly he’s not much better than Marcus Smart if at all.
He's just a shit Marcus Smart
Like Marcus smart. Wish celtics fans would stop blindly defending him
Marcus smart flair
If Ben could shoot like even some line like Marcus Smart we'd be a dynasty.
Marcus Smart with a tear in his eye.
"A) I challenge you to read the fucking absurd trade scenarios r/bostonceltics has been pulling out of its collective ass to make that happen. Absolutely none of them are realistic, and it would take a crazy overpayment on our part to make it happen, or some incredibly stupid team to make a super one-sided deal with us for shits and giggles. It's not happening this year IMO.  B) Re-signing Fournier and extending Smart are going to be essentially the same money, and it just so happens that Marcus Smart is one of the only pieces we have that has any trade value. I've been saying it for a while that I don't think any roster shuffling happens this offseason without moving Smart first, and after 7 years of the Marcus Smart Experience, I'm ready to have Fournier instead."
How are they not? Blake griffin right now better than rob williams?? Landry shamet over marcus smart?? lmaooo alright my guy
"As we know it by in Boston, the Marcus Smart Conundrum."
Marcus Smart?
"You mentioned RJ, Noel, Bullock, and Quickley. RJ is a sophomore who didn't even make an all rookie team (wasn't a top 15 rookie last year). Noel and Bullock are journeymen who no one would have talked about has assets to a team until this year. And Quickley is a rookie who was picked with the 25th pick. All those guys played way better than were expected this year but a big reason for that is because Randle made them better.   And yes they were available more often than the supporting cast of Celtics but none of those guys are even close to being an all star.  Meanwhile Celtics had 58 games from a current all star in Jaylen Brown. 43 games from Kemba a 2020 all star. 48 games from Marcus Smart who is more of an asset than any of the Knicks players above.  Maybe you can make the argument that the Knicks supporting cast is better due to health but it's not a huge advantage.  The biggest difference was Randle played 10% more games. And I know you weren't arguing against Randle to start but that is the reason why he is clearly above Tatum for all nba this year."
"I mean he's a legit really bad shooter and every player knows it.    I used to be solidly in the camp of ""just shoot the damn ball until you improve"" - i.e. the Marcus Smart.  But Simmons inability to be better than a 60% FT shooter after 5 years in the NBA says he may just be a shitty shooter for life."
It’s the truth. If you think otherwise you’re close minded as fuck. I’m open to steering that Trae m’s foul baiting is annoying as hell. But he does not flop in nearly the same form or fashion as guys like Embiid or Marcus Smart. Open your eyes man
"Dak’s still young. No disrespect to Mr. Rodgers, he’s obviously a first ballot Hall of Famer and one of the best to ever do it. I won’t compare Dak to Aaron but a lot of people forget that Dak was on pace not to break records, but to *shatter* records before he broke his ankle, and the D in Dallas stands for Offense right now with all of our weapons. Obviously I’m a bit biased but I think Dak will have an HoF career by the time all is said and done.  Also always love talking NFL in r/nba so thanks and good luck next season. May we please have Marcus Smart?"
I hate that I laughed. Something something Marcus Smart something /s
"That was such obviously bullshit posturing from the beginning though. If a ref thinks a player's flopping, then simply don't bail him out with a foul call.  What amazes me is that no matter how many times Trae Young, Marcus Smart, Kyle Lowry, et al. play them for utter fools, they're never reticent to oblige."
"And yet, in addition to holding his opponents to a much lower field goal percentage, mattisse still outperformed him in most defensive counting stats except rebounds, which he's never asked to do, and deflections, which Matisse wasn't that far behind (and tied with Marcus smart and Jimmy Butler)."
Marcus smart isn’t on here ?!
"I thought the two teams were fine, but then seeing this list with guys like Lu Dort and Marcus Smart... idk how to feel any more. Probably remove Kawhi and Giannis... maybe even Jimmy.  Those 3 are all good defenders when they want to be, but it feels like they get these nods just by virtue of playing longer minutes due to their overall contributions on both ends, and people are like ""35 minutes of good defense is better than 20 minutes of great defense,"" which is why I was surprised but glad that Thybulle got the nod"
"No im saying they kept the game clean because both sides got called for obvious fouls. It wasn’t biased either way. Giannas got his calls in Brooklyn and not just makeup calls but in the midst of the game. I’m saying if the refs call the game right on both sides it forces both teams to play straight up defense and respect the game. When you give humans an inch they take another inch. If you let guys like Pat Bev, Pj tucker, Marcus smart etc get away with a little holding and grabbing they’ll keep going until you call them on it."
"There aren't many point guards left who are true floor generals, guys playing three dimensional chess with that next level understanding and have the ability to be that guy on the court consistently. Who are thinking beyond what they're supposed to do, knowing what everyone else should do, communicating well, motivating, knowing when feed the right guy, knowing when to take over, etc.  The only guards that fit that next level of floor general right now and have the ability to take full advantage of it are Chris Paul and Steph Curry (they have completely different styles of play, but they are always completely in control of the game). Damian Lillard is close, but doesn't move without the ball or pass as well as those two guys. There are a few guys like Marcus Smart or Andre Iguadola or even Draymond Green that understand the game well enough, but don't quite have the skill level to be that guy consistently every night. Those guys are invaluable teammates though. Luka, LeBron, and Jokic aren't technically guards, but some people might put them in the conversation as basketball becomes positionless so I could see an argument for each of them. Chris Paul really is a throwback though.   Paige Buekers, Sabrina Ionescu and Diana Taurasi fit that mold on the ladies side. You have to be really smart, but you also have to see the game of basketball in a way where you kinda always feel like you are in the zone and then have all the skills necessary to get the best shot for you or your teammates in any situation. It's knowing when your teammates get hot, what shots they prefer, where they like to catch the basketball for a catch and shoot 3 versus a curl to the basket. It's next level things that even in the NBA only a handful of guys are capable of seeing and then having the skill to execute. There are a bunch of NBA role players who have very limited athleticism, can't shoot outside ten feet, yet they got to the league and can dominate within that role just by having that level of understanding, they make incredible teammates. You need those players to win championships. Chris Paul is on another level though."
"You caught me. I'm Marcus Smart, AMA."
"The problem with the perception of role players is that most people think that just because you have a defined role on a team that that makes you, by definition, a role player. That's not really how that works.   Manu Ginobli is a good example of this as well. He had a very clearly defined role on the Spurs as their 6th man/2nd unit leader, but he was also legitimately one of their 3 best players during their run. Every player has their role; the star players just have the ability to take over a game at any time.   Marcus Smart would be a good example, to me, of a role player who has made his role (in his case as the heart of the team) an essential part of his team's success, to the point where I'd argue he is a star player as well. Maybe not a traditional star player, but ask any Celtics fan who their most important players are and I'd bet nearly every single one of them will include Marcus Smart on that list."
1. Herro  2. Luka  3. Pritchard  4. Marcus Smart  5. Melrose Place  6. Jokic  7. 87-year old Bill Russell  8. KD  9. Lebron  10. Curry  11. Harden  ---  t-last. Westbrook   t-last. Peak Chamberlain
I said superstar which Tatum isn’t but   Kemba and Marcus Smart are better than everybody on this Nets team save MAYBE Joe Harris who didn’t have a great game either. The defense he received this game wasn’t close to what Tatum got in that game either.
PJ Tucker is a 6’6” Marcus Smart. Aggressively annoying
"How about one Smart Marcus, and a Lord of Time?"
"All flop team:  C - Joel Embiid, PF - Lebron James, SF - James Harden, SG - Marcus Smart, PG - Trae Young, 6th Man - Kyle Lowry. Team goes 16-0 in the playoffs."
“Dude calm the fuck down. Why are people getting so damn angry when some random player didn’t get the hate his haters think he deserves. Weird af.” Also you’re comparing pat bev to Gary Payton and Marcus smart. Nobody said he was that good. Also height is just as big a deal than wingspan wtf are you talking about? How am I supposed to contest a jumper from a guy who’s got not only 6 inches on me but also a larger wingspan? Hes played great defense this series because defense is played as a team and a lot of the times he was matched up on Mitchell which makes his individual defense also impressive for how undersized he is
"Dude calm the fuck down. Why are people getting so damn angry when some random player didn't get the praise his fans think he deserve. Weird af.   &gt;Also bev held Mitchell to 4/14 in the regular season  Sample size of 14 shots?   &gt;Damn a 6’1 guard didn’t play great defense on a 6’7 scoring machine. Who would’ve thought.  Wingspan is much more important than height while defending. Doncic has 7'2, Mitchell has 6'10 and Beverley has 6'6. Also Marcus Smart is little as well, he never was that much of a mismatch in the playoffs in his career. Gary Payton would lock down guys much much bigger than him.   The thing is Beverley regressed from last year and his Rockets days. Just stop being a homer and accept that your team collectively did a great job on Mitchell and watch that 1st quarter again."
That just means Schroeder isn’t worth $84m/4 years. Rather get a Covington or Korver at that price or a Seth Curry or Marcus Smart at that price.
I’m pretty sure its actually named after Marcus Smart sooooo
Marcus Morris has been fucking awful this post season. Kennard isn't lethal enough and a smart enough team defender to provide more value than JJ. Batum is definitely better than any SF Lob City had. Mann is just a role player.   Edit: lethal enough as a scorer
"&gt;Need a summit of Marcus Smart, James Harden, Trae Young and Embiid talking about the art of flopping.   &gt;   &gt;Sponsored by Manu.  Produced by SpringHill Entertainment."
"Need a summit of Marcus Smart, James Harden, Trae Young and Embiid talking about the art of flopping.  Sponsored by Manu."
"It’s not always about immediately winning the trade.   This current Portland roster is not championship caliber and has no way to get to that unless they trade Dame and do a proper, successful rebuild. They missed their chance, now they have to move on to the next era. Marcus Smart and Romeo Langford will be very good for them."
A 95 yr old Marcus Smart stan.... LMAO
Marcus Smart did
"Oh, I read the question as the opponents on defense handling the Nuggets. If they get Lillard, they would still be about the same defensively as they are currently without Murray. They definitely need another guy alongside Gordon who can defend wing players. Given that the Celtics are a mess, maybe the Nuggets can grab Marcus Smart from them."
What about Marcus smart? He Def gonna win this tournament
Marcus Smart❤️
Maybe marcus smart?
Marcus Smart flops more than anyone.
The Marcus Smart effect is alive tonight.   It is simply about the dangers of giving a role player confidence in his own abilities.   Bruce Brown thought he was elite after starting the game 6-10. Now Cousins thinks he is 23 years old because he has 6 points.
"Bruce Brown did his best Marcus Smart imitation tonight.  Welcome to Celtics fans world.  Live by the brown, die by the Brown."
"Brown took that from the Marcus Smart playbook. 3 better shooters and 2 all-nba teammates on the floor? Nah, I got this"
"He also guarded harden lmao, not saying he is Marcus Smart or Ben Simmons or whoever, but it doesn’t help guarding Harden just to switch on Durant and Irving. Not saying I don’t like his rep knock, means he is cheaper to resign."
Marcus Smart
"&gt; The national basketball team for Yugoslavia if it still existed would be nuts and could 100% take down Team USA.  I think 100% beating Team USA is hyperbolic unless they're playing the same 2019 roster, in this hypothetical scenario, which included: Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Joe Harris, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Donovan Mitchell, Mason Plumlee, Marcus Smart, Jayson Tatum, Myles Turner, Kemba Walker, Derrick White.  That being said, a Yugoslavian team would wreck shop."
"The gap between the team the US put out two years ago and its best team is massive. If the US actually sent their best players, you're looking at something like:  Steph curry, LeBron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, Draymond Green, and DeAndre Ayton.   The team that they actually sent was:  Marcus smart, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen brown, Harrison Barnes, Derrick white, Mason plumlee, Khris Middleton, Kemba walker, Joe Harris, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, and Donovan Mitchell."
"Huh? How does starting Smart ruin our forward framework? We obviously need to add size to this team, which is why I’m not giving you names of point guards to add. I don’t want to invest in point guard. I don’t want to invest in Kemba Walker. I am good with a Smart, Brown, Tatum backcourt and adding size instead. I can give you almost a dozen names of players with size, because unlike point guard, that’s something I’m interested in adding… Larry Nance Jr, Al Horford, Kristaps Porzingis, Harrison Barnes, Marcus Morris, Christian Wood, Myles Turner, Thad Young, Kyle Anderson."
"I mean I just spent six straight comments asking what available PG would be better than him and you ignored it five times and then said “Marcus Smart” which ruins our entire working Forwards structure, so idk what to tell you."
"Someone in the starting 5 has to be scoring only 9 points. Tatum, then Brown need to run the offense. And we need more size. Marcus Smart would be my choice, but again I’m not *really* looking for a point guard. I’m looking to give Tatum the ball."
"This lol.  Everytime i see them play, it's the same three dudes who take turns with the occasional Marcus Smart special. Assuming they somehow swap Kemba for CJ, it doesn't really change anything."
"thats fucking nuts, im a little biased tho as i realy could give two shits about the jazz, is this deserving? i really feel PG shouldve won 2 years ago but maybe thats just me / marcus smart should win one. 3 dpoys ina row is no easy feat but i cant help but feel hes not THAT good"
&gt;  there is lots of bias towards rim protecting bigs who make lots of blocks  Thinking Basketball did a piece on Marcus Smart where he argued that even though he's the best perimeter defender in the league he's not as valuable as elite rim protectors.
Marcus Smart is up there
"Marcus smart is another guy like this, the empty arenas made it great for hearing how much these guys talk on the floor during the game!"
"I actually really like it. Celtics need playmaking and rebounding, both of which Russ brings in spades. The Jays bring enough shooting and scoring by themselves, but Russ will help everyone else look better.  The issue is the fit with Marcus Smart, right? They have a lot of the same weaknesses, although Russ is obviously the far better player.  Can you do, like, Kemba+picks for Russell and then Smart for some rim protecting big? Maybe somehow finesse Lopez or Gafford away from the Wizards?"
Marcus Smart.
"Then we don’t do it.  Robert Williams, Kemba Walker, Marcus Smart, and 3 FRPs + Swaps is more than enough for a 30 year old point guard who relies on explosiveness with a $50,000,000 contract.  Kemba was an Ironman once to."
"Westbrook is making $10 million more per year than Kemba is, and the Celtics are already right up against the luxury tax as it is, even before they try to re-sign Fournier (assuming they actually try to re-sign him). I doubt they're willing to go $10 million into the luxury tax without Fournier just to swap Kemba for Russ.   If they did get Russ, Fournier would almost certainly be gone and the Celtics would probably have to look for someone to take Tristian Thompson's contract as well. There's basically zero chance Boston's ownership is gonna be willing to go into the tax next year with a team that was this mediocre. Especially not when they still have to extend Marcus Smart."
Kemba is barely playable in the playoffs.  Wall would be like Marcus Smart with worse shooting but better playmaking
Why the fuck would we want to pay Marcus Smart with worse defense 45 million dollars a year for the next two years
"They don’t need to be a good scorer, just someone who can facilitate for Tatum Jaylen and KP in this instance &amp; I expect them to trade Marcus Smart so I imagine they’d find a guard that way"
"He was forced to take a brunt of the offensive load in Houston and that's not his role. In theory he's a great fit. Taller, pass first guard who can drive as well. That's pretty much Marcus smart with worse defense."
"I agree with this overall, but I do think there was a window where we really should have competed.   We had a starting 5 of Kyrie, Jaylen, Jayson, Hayward, and Horford in 2017-2018 (for one game before Hayward went down), then again in 2018-2019. Even without Hayward, and with the Jays being earlier in their career, those were teams that should have gotten further, particularly the 2018-2019 team, that also had Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris, Theis, and Rozier.   Our team's since 2017 have either had great players and 0 chemistry, or great chemistry but an incomplete roster.   I don't blame Danny for the Kyrie years, it's not his fault Kyrie acted the way he did. I do kind of blame him for the Kemba thing, and for not putting together a better roster the past 2 years.   I know we made the ECF last year in the bubble, but we really should have at least been in the finals. This year, first round exit.   If the Jays leave without a title, or at least 3-4 years of a sustained run and a finals appearance, then what are we doing?  I hope Kemba and us can part ways, and I hope Zarren/Brad as heads of the front office lead to better things too."
Marcus Smart is not better than Clint Capela or Andrew Wiggins
"Kemba didn't even take a paycut lol.  The Hornets lowballed him and weren't even offering him a regular max.  The Celtics were gave him 35m and the Hornets only offered 32m.  If he wants to be treated like a core part of a contender, he better play like it.  Can't be outplayed by Marcus Smart and expect a team to want to keep you on a max contract."
"Top 8 for C's that year:  1) Rookie Tatum  2) Soph Brown  3) Horford  4) Smart  5) Marcus Morris  6) 3rd Year Rozier  7) Aron Baynes  8) Rookie Semi Ojeleye  Top 8 for the Raptors:  1) Kawhi  2) Kyle Lowry  3) Soph. Siakam  4) Soph. FVV  5) Ibaka  6) Gasol  7) Norman Powell  8) Danny Green  That's a ton of talent on the Raps side. If that goes beyond 5, I'd be shocked."
"50 passes per game list looks like pretty good company. ""PTs created"", pushes Ben up the rankings. What makes you think assist to pass percentage a good metric? 3 of the top 4 players by that metric are score first guards that dump the ball off when double teamed. James Harden gets ranked 10th by that sorting. It seems more indicative of play style than ""goodness"".    Trae Young  Russell Westbrook  Damian Lillard  Luka Doncic  Chris Paul  Mike Conley  Ja Morant  James Harden  Jrue Holiday  Ben Simmons  LeBron James  Marcus Smart  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Derrick Rose  Tobias Harris  Nikola Jokic  Dennis Schroder  Royce O'Neale"
"I want to say Marcus Smart, although he had a down year. Even in this down year he handled guys like Giannis (drew like 3 or 4 charges on him in one game) and Jokic, AD switches in the post. He really guards 1-4 and can switch onto 5’s in limited time. That counts for something but he is also 6’4 at the most, which is pretty cool he can defend 6’11 guys posting him."
"Tatum couldn't beat Milwaukee with Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Marcus Smart and Al Horford, with Brad Stevens as a coach. Cope how you want, Embiid is better. OH, and Luka will ALWAYS be a better player than Trash Young."
marcus smart
Marcus Smart doesn't take 17 shots or make 35m/yr lol
It’s almost like Marcus Smart and Paul George are asked to do different things to contribute for their team and one is getting paid all star money. What dumb comment
You cant hold pg to the same standards as marcus smart lmao
"He didn’t shoot well but he played great defense, had several hustle plays down the stretch which kept the Clippers in the game, and had some good playmaking as well.  He can play better but this was not a bad game from PG. If *you* think this was bad but you think Marcus Smart is a good player you need to look in the mirror, because even when PG’s shot isn’t falling he’s a better version of Smart."
"3rd in the NBA in WS/48 behind only Jokic and Embiid.  Celtics record with Rob starting, 10-3. Celtics record without him starting, 26-33.  I seriously don’t give a shit if someone who doesn’t watch the team has opinions on our players and tells me how valuable or good they are. You haven’t seen his impact with your own eyes.   A package of Robert Williams, Marcus Smart, Kemba Walker, and every FRP + Swap is absolutely a superstar sized haul. You don’t know shit."
"i'm not sure he meant 30% on open.. i think he meant like yeah i could be like a Russ who just takes them and makes them at that clip   but like Marcus Smart has won the Celtics playoff games in series they have no chance in because he'll randomly go 7/12 from three   if Ben can do something similar to that, and just doesn't force them like Russ or Smart and just takes open ones, that would be incredible"
"Someone else pointed out in the thread that the Celtics cap situation would basically mean the team would literally be Steph, Tatum, Brown (coming off an injury), and midlevel exception guy plus minimum guys. I don’t know the contract specifics, but it seems like there could be some bird-rights shenanigans to keep guys like Marcus Smart depending on the order everything gets done in. Steph still has another year on his contract, so it could probably be worked out."
What would they even give up?  Jaylen for CJ? Not sure thats a good move  Marcus smart and picks for CJ? Defense goes off a cliff
marcus smart is an obvious pick. he'd be amazing
"One game in 2 years isn't much of a sample size. I love what i saw and hope he builds off of it, and you cant get better timing for the performance. But he has had plenty of time to show a shot, and he hasn't. Both the rookies already showed they can shoot with the best of them in limited time. Its a shame pritchard didn't get a lot of practice time this season or an offseason to develop, he could have played major playoff minutes for us if he was just a little more polished. I expect him to get 20 minutes a game next year and be a more major piece of the playoff rotation. Same goes for Nesmith, he showed he has the size to be an effective defender and if he can just slow down his game, he showed he can shoot the lights out. Romeo is more in the marcus smart mold, but without the playmaking. Need to see a lot more from him next year"
Why do i feel like Marcus Smart is on this team next year?
Ya guess what makes you a better shooter? Playing along side CP3 and Booker. There is far less pressure on Bridges to do anything. He is such better role player because of that. This is like comparing Marcus Smart and PJ Tucker.   PJ is going to show better in advanced stats that you'll obsess over but Smart has the ability to do it on his own. Both have their fits in the NBA.  You are insane to think Bridges makes OKC better than what Sort can contribute. Stats cannot be compared to players in completely different situations.
"Non-Celtics fans.  1) What would you trade us for Marcus Smart?  2) If he shoots &lt; 40% FG again next season, what deal would you offer him in free agency?"
Hey he didn't call everyone on the Bucks Marcus Smart. That counts for something.
"it's not like kemba was good though in the time he did play... However, Marcus Smart stepped up in that series. Annoying ass fly of a player but he hit some big shots"
You counting Marcus Smart as the 2nd then?
"&gt;Regardless, I could just as easily point at all the $13M bargains in this league.  Marcus Smart, Malik Beasley, Covington, Warren...  How much worse is Kuzma compared to the players you mentioned?   Smart hasn't given you the elite defense this year and is as bone-headed as Kuzma on the offensive end. Which is why he is also in trade rumors all year long but didn't get the interest that Ainge wanted. Malik Beasley and Warren are good offensive players and more efficient than Kuzma, yes, but they are a significant downgrade on the defensive end.  Covington, I do agree is a better player than Kuzma and is a bargain at his contract, but the Blazers needed to trade 2 first round picks to get him. You don't need to do that for Kuzma."
"Maybe they can replace him with a high level role player. Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Richaun Holmes, anyone who isn't a pure onball scorer maybe?"
"Joseph was a bad contract.  Winslow can't stay healthy and isn't sniffing $13M again.  Kennard is a lethal shooter which carries a premium.   Regardless, I could just as easily point at all the $13M bargains in this league.  Marcus Smart, Malik Beasley, Covington, Warren...  Bottom line is that like many young guys in this price range Kuzma was given $13M in the hopes that he'd grow into something more, and he's failed to do that.  His contract isn't some massive albatross, but it's a solid overpay, and teams are not going to be itching to give up something *better* than Kuzma for Kuzma."
Marcus Smart
Yeah Marcus Morris and Marcus Smart.
"Marcus Smart, he takes a lot of flak for his playing style while other worse players that rely on a similar style get undeserved praises. I think it's because he plays in Boston, many people hate that team.   Also Pat Connaughton."
"Reasoning:   1. Cunningham is the surefire guy of this draft. You could argue other guys have more upside, but nobody has a higher floor. Cade will be an NBA starter, it's just a question of whether he'd be a third option, second option, or first option on a contender.  2. Green is the type of hyperathletic scoring guard that teams crave. He's the most likely in this draft to become the first option on a contender, in my opinion. He fits well with the Rockets rebuild, forming a dynamic duo with KPJ in the backcourt.  3. Mobley is a fascinating prospect who brings great perimeter skills in a big man's body. His post offense is worrying, and his lack of a shot is too, but his perimeter defense and driving ability as a seven footer make him a unicorn, even if those other skills don't develop.  4. Suggs is the purest PG in the draft, a classic ball handler who projects to do everything right, even if he lacks any one exceptional gift. He's a sizable point guard with no holes in his game. A very safe pick with long term upside. This guy might be Toronto's starting point guard for the next fifteen years.  5. Barnes fits that Patrick Williams mold, and if Williams can go 4th off the Seminoles bench, Barnes can do it as their most important player. He's a big, high motor wing who can lock down guards and has shown potential at the other end. Even if he doesn't develop his shot, he'll be a valuable wing for years to come.  6. Kuminga has the body, he has the athleticism, but his basketball IQ is horrible. He showed flashes of ball handling, shot creation, passing, and mid-range shooting, but his only positive talent right now is getting to the rim from a midrange spot. He's the definition of a boom or bust project pick, but his boom is big enough that he's worth betting on by a rebuilding team, similar to Poku last year.  7. Wagner here is probably going to be controversial. In my defense, John Hollinger at The Athletic and Deanondraft both agree with me. He's a big wing who can guard 1-4 and projects to be very above average at it in the NBA, rebounds well, passes surprisingly well (&gt;2:1 AST:TO), slashes well, and shoots FTs at an elite level for a 19yo, let alone a 6'9 forward. He projects to be a Kelly Oubre type with less hops and finishing ability, but more shooting and passing. He'll be a valuable player from day 1 as a teenager at a premium position, and has all the tools to become an exceedingly solid wing, if probably not ever an all star due to his lack of elite quick twitch muscle. As a final point, if you want to bring up his last game (where he wasn't great), I'll remind you he also outplayed Scottie Barnes in their March Madness matchup.  8. Moody is the most likely guy in this draft to become a plus 3&amp;D wing for the next fifteen years. Lots of Warriors fans want him, but I simply don't see him having the upside of Wagner. He slides into the Orlando roster, providing needed spacing and defense.  9. Johnson has a lot of question marks, but when he has it all together, he puts up crazy numbers. He can do it all. His shot may be questionable but he shows promise. He's the second biggest boom or bust prospect after Kuminga, in my opinion, and Sacramento needs to swing for the fences to get out of their current purgatory.  10. Bouknight has been flying up mock drafts, and I think he's a good pick, but a little overrated at this point. He has some major flaws despite his highlight play athleticism. His ball handling, shooting, and defense all need more work than I think most people recognize.  11. Keon is similar to Bouknight: some very promising signs at the shooting guard position, but a whole bunch of question marks as well. Not too much to say here, just a guy drafted for his potential.  12. Sengun has promise - Hollinger would say I have him way too low - and I get it: he's putting up good numbers in a really good league as a teenager, and such guys rarely fail in the NBA. However, he's a tweener, neither a PF nor a C, and he lacks the shooting that would cover for his deficiencies at either position. He could put it together and be a valuable big man, but he might end up getting run off the floor, too.  13. Giddey is another boom or bust guy, a huge point guard who can pass like crazy, but lacks the shooting or defense requisite for the position. He's young as hell, so it all comes down to a team's deep scouting on him. Can they fix his obvious flaws? If he develops right, he could end up being an amazing player. But that seems to be a long way off. A team like the Pacers, in that 8th seed purgatory, needs to take a gamble to get out, similar to the Nuggets with MPJ.  14. Kispert projects to be the best shooter in this draft, and his defense is actually pretty good. Was in the 25th percentile for lateral movement at the combine, FYI - I definitely had some bias against his defensive skills, picturing him as a lumbering (white) player. But he has the size and strength and shooting skill to be an elite floor spacer, and can drive better than you might imagine. There are questions around his shooting stroke being effective against NBA defense, but in all likelihood he'll be a good-if-not-great 3&amp;D player right out of the gate.   No Davion Mitchell, you ask? Yeah. I'm incredibly low on him. His FT% has declined each season in college. His first two collegiate seasons he shot about 30% from deep, then happened to shoot 45% his last year, without a corresponding increase to 2pt% or FT% - that's the definition of an outlier. Yeah he plays good defense, but his 6'0 height limits him on that end. At best he'll be a smaller Marcus Smart, which is wonderful, but very limited. And I don't think he gets to that level."
Is he worth so much more than Marcus Smart?   I hope so because I don’t want Marcus at even 20 mil. Maybe 15 or so.   Jaylen Brown got 26.5 average and put up 25-6-4 on 48-39-75  Seems like Lonzo should be somewhere between.
Yep. It's always been his issue. He has no post game. He has no handle and he has a high center of gravity so it's super easy for him to get pushed off his spots. And he refuses to learn a post game for some reason. Marcus Smart (granted he is a great defender) owns KP any time they play each other it seems.
"Nah, it's not because of injuries. He's always struggled with competent smaller defenders, Marcus Smart would eat him up on the regular. His high center of gravity makes it really hard for him to back them down."
"I mean, on our end it's Marcus Smart and Horford for Tobias Harris and 2 firsts, I don't hate it that much. We'd just need to find a PG."
"Jae Crowder learned from the flop goat himself, Marcus Smart."
"I get that players have to sell the contact, but this was one of the funnier flops I’ve seen. Middleton waited a solid 3-4 seconds after being hit before falling on the ground. Made me burst out loud laughing, he should take some lessons from Marcus smart on how to flop right after the contact."
"Simmons and Matisse are not better than Jrue.. they have the advantage of being hyper agressive because they have Embiid behind them protecting the paint when they reach for a steal and get beat.. Ive never seen someone get blown by as much as Simmons for someone who is considered one of the best defenders in the nba... Look at guards that dont have a strong defensive ancor like Kawhi and Marcus Smart, they both keep their man in front of them and make them take bad shots,"
cause surely marcus smart never complains to the refs or flops
I wish Marcus smart was holiday.
"Marcus Smart is like 6’3” with a 6’9” wingspan. Mitchell is 6’1” with a 6’4” wingspan? Like she says, them inches matter."
For some reason Warriors fans are more in love with Bouknight and completely united against Mitchell for some reason (yet wanted Marcus Smart who does literally the same stuff). I love Mitchell's feel for the game and his IQ. Wouldn't need too much adjustment playing off the ball. Ppl are making too much of the FTs and not enough of the improvements he did make as a senior.   Bouknight strikes me as another tunnel vision dude who'd look to just get his own bucket all the time. Warriors fans in this sub think that's am immediate answer to their bench problem. And it's not.
"Jrue is a good defender, but if I want a one way defender, I won’t pay 30 million and give up 7 picks for one.  I’ll just trade bledsoe and a pick for Marcus smart or dejounte Murray who are younger, play elite defense, and are also bigger so they can switch onto wings.   We chose jrue because he can run a halfcourt offense well and is a threat off of screens.   If he doesn’t play like that, we were better off with just getting a good defensive guard and paying him 15 a year,"
"You left out that during that 1 game of 20/30 Marcus Smart is the best player in the world, in that 48 minute window. Been a fan since his UT days"
"But, you know, trading possibly your franchise GOAT for, according to your solutions:  Picks Expiring contracts Marcus Smart   Seem like completely logical moves which would be more conducive to raising the value of the blazers"
"&gt;Picks lots and lots of picks see New Orleans or OCK. Also RJ if he is up for trade from the Knicks and Brown or honestly even Smart from Celtics  So many things wrong with this. NOLA's picks will be pretty useless once they add an MVP candidate to a team with Zion and Ingram. OKC are tanking, so a 30+ year old MVP caliber player won't help, especially since Shai probably is going to be sent the other way as well. RJ is a great player, but idk if the Knicks are willing to trade him or if he'll ever come close to Dame(plus the weird RJ/CJ fit). If you genuinely think Marcus Smart is better than Ben Simmons for the Blazers, you're out of your mind. Simmons is literally better at everything except for his 3 point shot, and Marcus Smart's incredible 37.6/32/77.7 shooting splits aren't exactly elite.    edit: Just saw your point about Simmons being on a max, but that honestly doesn't matter too much. They're going to have to match salaries anyway, so they're going to be taking on 30+ million"
"17 games is *nothing* in NBA terms. *Marcus Smart* had a 17-game stretch back in 2018 where he shot 45% from three. Mitchell's a career 36% shooter in the regular season on a *far* larger sample size, and three-point shooting is the highest variance part of the game. I'm not saying he *doesn't* step it up in the playoffs, but you shouldn't expect that sort of efficiency to continue."
"You think he’s getting $18M tho? I think a Marcus Smart deal like 4 yr, $52M (player option for 4th yr) sounds reasonable"
It took me my pretty much his entire career to admit LeBron James was great. Larry Bird is closer to 10 all time than 5. Marcus Smart might never get back to his previous defensive level.
"Well he is a core piece, but just in a different way. Like Draymond is indisputably a core piece of the Warriors dynasty even if he wasn't a star offensively in terms of the PPG he averaged or the FGAs he got up.   I guess we'll find out this year about Smart as I've always thought he's been hindered by playing off the ball as a 2 as that encourages him to shoot more. I think him playing as the point, he can be more of the set up man to look to get JT and JB easier shots and he can average 7+ assists per game easily. Their %s go up massively when he is on the court and he is the one feeding them the ball because he is a good playmaker despite not being much of a scoring threat, specifically inside the 3-point line.   I've said a few times already that I think Marcus is the guy who will actually benefit the most from the coaching change, I think he badly needed somebody who could hold him accountable for the games where he plays like Marcus Dumb instead of Marcus Smart, and Brad just wasn't going to be that guy. I think a guy like Udoka, who was a player in the league, a role player in the league, will be able to reach him and get him to play smarter, whilst still playing just as hard as he always does."
"Alright I agree with your sentiment, but I won't tolerate needless Marcus Smart slander, guy is a great role player who is far too often asked to take on a greater role than he should on offense because of injuries to our key guys. He is absolutely capable of being a starter on a championship team, look at Jae Crowder right now on the Suns, he can be exactly like him."
"Pretty sure if it was up to Celtics fans we'd still be running out IT, James Posey, and Paul Pierce every game to support our future HOFer Marcus Smart."
"&gt; You act like Jaylen is a lock to be better than Dame,  Doesn't need to be. It's not a Jaylen:Dame swap straight up. There's an opportunity cost to the other things you give up for Dame.  &gt; a lock to stay here for his next contract  Jaylen is under team control for 3 years, Dame for 4. I'd rather roll with the younger guy with 1 less year and see what happens.  &gt; and that Tatum's a lock to be here as well  He's locked up for as long as Dame is. If he bounces after 4 years fine.  Marcus Smart is good for what he is, a defensive PG.  If the Jays can't make that leap and do it together, fine. I'd rather see if they can than pay 35 year old Dame $48M. Fuck that."
"who cares, he's an all-NBA player. Marcus Smart is 6'3"", it's not like we have dominant towering point guard playing now. Lillard is 10x the player smart is."
"Damian Lillard is 31 years old in an era where primes are longer and later into guy's careers than ever in NBA history. You act like Jaylen is a lock to be better than Dame, a lock to stay here for his next contract, and that Tatum's a lock to be here as well. Well, if you want to keep one or both of those guys around, you better get some fucking help. Because the rest of this team is dogshit. Dame is better than Brown now -- and you know what? he'll probably be better than him 4 years, too.  And Marcus Smart fucking sucks. Most overrated player on the Celtics for like 10 years."
"Imagine bringing in Keldon Johnson... even if that was the type of player that the team needed, Marcus Smart has international experience from last year."
"Who needs assists when you have Dame, Tatum, Brown, and Marcus ""Steph curry once every 20-30 games"" Smart?  Just ignore the fact that there's no way in hell we get Dame without losing Brown and/or Smart"
"I got an interesting 3 team trade.   Lillard to Boston  CJ to 76ers  Portland gets: Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, and Ben Simmons.   No picks or filler needed.  Portland can resign Powell and Kanter. Then go with a Simmons, Powell, Brown, RoCo, Nurkic starting lineup. Smart and Kanter on the bench.  The defense would be very good. Just no true #1 scoring option."
"Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, and picks. Who says no? Don’t @ me"
"Hear me out, al horford Marcus smart and big tack."
Marcus Smart is camped out at Logan waiting for the call
Lonzo or Milez Turner please. Maybe Marcus Smart also
You need a point guard with defense! Why not Marcus Smart? Lol
Beal isn't a defensive savant. Unless they go the pat bev or Marcus smart route Trae is a good option.
Marcus smart or lamelo pls
Marcus Smart come on down
Marcus smart
Grab Marcus Smart for defense.
"He’s lost a lot of lateral mobility and quickness with the most recent injury/surgery. Especially early in the year you could see him being late on D a lot — he routinely thought he could wait another beat and still get the block in time, but just couldn’t. The pivot isn’t simple either with the narrow hips.  Relatively poor sense of balance also means any pressure from a tightly-hugging defender to his base throws him off-balance on shots. Defences haven’t adjusted entirely to that yet, but as the year went on ever more wings covered him rather than bigs. Last year it was only a handful of the largest defensive wings and Marcus Smart."
"What elite guards did they play? Jrue Holiday? Marcus Smart?  It’ll be a real issue when you play someone like Curry, LeBron, Kawhi, Luka, etc who will continually hunt Kyrie on defense."
"Keep in mind a lot of guys have no interest.  Many of whom opted out long ago.  Like Marcus Smart would probably be exactly what the team needs right now, but he wants to rest his body this offseason from nagging injuries last year.  So options are limited.  That said, I'm certain they can find a better fit than Robinson as they already have an abundance of shooting."
"marcus smart deserves way more respect than he gets  man has survived being shot by snipers like three times a week for years now, utterly insane"
Get Marcus smart
"Replacements should be pure role players who just play defense, hustle, and keep the ball moving. Marcus Smart and Alex Caruso would do wonders for this team."
Yeah although for whatever reason despite the flopping I’ve always loved Marcus smart idk what it is about him in particular but I just love him
They need some more defensive minded players. What about Marcus Smart?
Just like Marcus Smart
"To some degree, I would agree, and in this particular case, we probably wouldn't have gotten Mitchell if we drafted Booker. However, it's frustrating as a Jazz fan because Marcus Smart did something similar the year prior, which led to us drafting Exum. The draft is supposed to be the great equalizer, but sometimes it doesn't work that way."
"Reminds me of Marcus Smart. Act tough one play, act like you got shot on the next play."
Crowder and Marcus Smart are a totally type of different flopper.  They are like local theatre troupe-level actors with the way they overact on defensive fouls.  Frankly embarrassing based on how much I respected his game when he played at Marquette.
This dude is Marcus Smart with more offensive freedom
He made some very dumb plays and then some clutch ones to make up for it.  On the Celtics we would call this a Marcus Smart.
Ask Marcus Smart
Tell that to Marcus Smart
"Huge game from Jae Crowder. Time to start considering him in that elite group of floppers with Marcus Smart, Chris Paul and James Harden"
Jrue Holiday is a glorified Marcus Smart
Jrue Holiday is a glorified Marcus Smart
Crowder is the west coast Marcus Smart
"nephew, wtf are you even on lmfaooo  Roy Hibbert is a 2x all-star, Kyle Korver is an all-star. Devin Booker spent the first 5 years of his career without one. Being an all-star means shit if when comes playoff time you're an 5 ppg scorer on sub 50% true shooting who gets played off court.  You must literally be the only dumb-fuck on earth that thinks Ben is better than Fox, not even your own fan-base thinks that, and this very post explains very well why. God damn you're really dumb.  Fox is a **much** better scorer, almost as good as a play-maker, and yes, worse defender. Good thing offense is by far the most important trait in this game and the reason why Steph and Dame both earn 40 million per year while PatBev and Marcus Smart don't."
Marcus Smart
"3 picks from the kings are nice though. They are probably still floundering in the lottery after the trade. If you start them 2-3 years from now instead of next year, so that you can begin getting them after Ben inevitably asks out to play in LA/NYC (he’s exactly the kind of player to go there for insta hoe booty), those are 3 top 5 picks.  Given how shitty the kings are, they could probably get some pieces for that.  Maybe trade them+tobi for jaylen brown and Marcus smart?"
"Marcus Smart in the running for flopper for sure. On the same note, why not add “Most Fined Player of the year”?"
"2019 was a way worse roster than this one. The roster was Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Joe Harris, Brook Lopez, Middleton, Donovan Mitchell, Mason fucking Plumlee, Marcus Smart, Tatum, Myles Turner, Kemba, and Derrick White. Their best player at the time was Kemba. This team’s best player is Kevin Durant."
‘Marcus Smart is my favorite player!’  *B*
Marcus Smart B+  Terry Rozier A-  Huh?
Nice write up. I thought Jaylen Brown and Payton Prichard would be busts. I thought Semi Olejeye and Marcus Smart would be better than they turned out!
"It’s both funnily enough.  On paper, Simmons has everything. He’s tall, fast, strong as fuck, has pretty good vision, is a DPOY candidate, pretty physically robust all things considered.   The problem is that he doesn’t shoot. Not that he is a bad scorer like Marcus Smart and a lot of other players, he just refuses to engage in plays. He also wants to handle the ball, as noted by Jimmy Butler, but doesn’t want anything to do with the ball when push comes to shove. He also can’t make free throws reliably and he doesn’t deal with hacking gracefully. His work ethic is also pretty suspect, he seemingly prefers to be coddled than pushed to improve. All of these things you do not want when you aren’t blowing people out.  So he’s a exceptional piece that will give you amazing defensive capability but he has zero offensive skills, even around the rim, and it is a gamble to get more than point blank range from him. The combination nets you one of the greatest regular season players that just so happens is beneficial in the playoffs due to his defense but can also tank you in the playoffs because you can end up playing 4 vs 5 offense. Any team trading for him is gambling on improving his mentality."
"Never said he was as good, just pointing out good D does not make you a superstar. Marcus Smart plays great D and can hit 3 pointers but he’s not an all star. They should have traded him when his value was higher. Now that rivers sees him he knows they can’t with him."
"First and most Gobert, Embid  Then   Marcus Smart  Basically every defensive player"
Why a Westbrook comp of all things?  Suggs is a lot closer to prime George Hill/Malcolm Brogdon/Marcus Smart athletically than Westbrook.  Idk I just don’t see Suggs being a top 7-8 player in the league but it’s not impossible.  Kuminga and Scottie Barnes could also be superstars eventually.
Yeah Phil is from Flower Mound. Same high school as Marcus smart
Mavs got Marcus smart Julius randle tyrese Maxey
"That’s not true. The people who actually hold down the viewership during the regular season want real basketball. The nba is a joke because it caters to casual fans who only want to watch Lebron vs KD or Lebron vs Curry and don’t know anyone other than superstars.  The NFL for all its faults doesn’t treat the fans like complete idiots and markets the entire team and more than just the QBs. There’s a reason Richard Sherman and JJ Watt are household names. In the nba, casuals have no clue who Marcus Smart, Jrue Holiday, Lowry, or Bam Adebayo are despite them being amazing defensive players and with good personalities."
"The current rule makes no sense - they fined exactly one player this year for it and it was Marcus Smart.  If the league really wanted to enforce it they would make it an immediate penalty in the game. Having the league asses warnings and fines days after the fact does little to keep a guy from making a ""play"" in the moment that might swing a game."
Marcus smart has ice in his veins
The problem with this is playoffs. I'd rather have Marcus Smart in the playoffs too. I'd rather have a slough of guys than Simmons.  And noone is starting a team from scratch. Maybe one of the basement teams will send a big trade package Philly's way that makes sense.
"well because that's a terrible comparison, marcus smart is a career 77% FT shooter and 32% 3 point shooter. great? no, but you can't leave him WIDE open and you can't hack him at the end of the game.  he's nowhere near as good as simmons but his limitations are a lot more compatible with philly since embiid is already an MVP talent  if you were starting a team from scratch, you'd be crazy to prefer smart though haha"
I'd rather have marcus smart
"Absolutely. Simmons is worth the 30mil in the reg season as he's a DPOY player who helps your team in so many ways, but in the playoffs he's a 6'10"" Marcus Smart. That's still pretty decent, but not max worthy."
"Ja Morant, Buddy, Ingram, Julius Randle, KAT. Bench of Trae, Zion, PJ Tucker, Lonzo, Miles Bridges, Marcus Smart, Duncan Rodinson, John Collins.   Literally took me a minute to name a better team. All young and healthy. Play makers, defenders/dogs, shooters, and rims runners. More dominant physically to beat up the world."
"I think you are spot on.  It used to be that the US had such an enormous talent gulf that nothing else really mattered- but the rest of the world has caught up to the point where cohesion, attitude and team defence are important.  What USA basketball needs to do is find four or five quality second tier players and offer them guaranteed olympic minutes in return for committing to regular training and long term availability over a 4 year cycle. Bearing in mind that someone like Marcus Smart still has more talent than 95% of international players.  Then when the olympics roll around, slot a few stars into that established system, alongside smart, unselfish experienced players, and the US would unstoppable again."
Can they still work on replacing the lineup? They need to take out at least lavine and k love for Myles turner and Jarrett Allen? Or even get a super hustle guy like pj tucker or Marcus smart.
I feel like Marcus Smart would help this team a lot
"You can't force guys to play and a few top guys are still in the playoffs.  That said, not to discount how far the rest of the world has come, but I feel like whichever team wins the NBA finals any given year could beat any team in the world. You don't need to just build an all star team. This is bigger than an exhibition. Gimme like 3 or 4 star players and a the rest of the roster can just be quality role players that can adapt to the international game.  Like Matisse Thybulle and Marcus Smart should low key have spots on this team if we're actually trying to win a gold."
It’d be interesting if they constructed the roster with actual role players. Feels insane to say but I truly believe taking away a couple of all star iso guys and swapping them with hustle guys like Alex Caruso and Marcus Smart would create a more cohesive team.
Ok I think Marcus Smart will because the new coach is focusing on him and I think Randle might fall off the way he was playing game 5 of the 1st round

Marcus Smart is Porzingis’ kryptonite
"&gt; When ~~Jrue~~ Middleton plays [Marcus] smart, the Bucks play well  FTFY"
"He’ll even if we ignore power forwards, I’ve seen multiple times where 6’3 Marcus smart can lock up a center for a possession or two. I’m not saying trez has to be lockdown but the fact that he’s so unbelievably bad on that end of the court is inexcusable."
Celtics fan just told me Marcus Smart better than Book
Marcus Smart &gt; Booker and I’m not joking
"Suspiciously not advocating his team be the one to trade these picks. But hey, if you wanna side with the guy who think Brooks is as good as Aaron Gordon and Marcus Smart then go ahead."
"Gordon might be a little better but same tier of player, throw Marcus Smart in there as well, good role players that teams can’t sign for free in FA.  The way teams use cap space, high end role players dont reach the open market any more, teams have to bid on them via trade."
"Dudes made the same amount of dirty plays as Marcus smart, but when smart does it it’s “hustle plays” and when pat does it it’s “dirty plays”"
"&gt;Why Memphis would do that? Brooks can help a lot of contenders  Precisely because Brooks and Anderson can help a lot of contenders, and Memphis isn't contending. Brooks isn't getting any better, and if Brooks is Marcus Smart, then you might as well send him to a team that needs him now.  They drafted Ziaire Williams, probably the most raw wing prospect in the draft this year, who they want to feed minutes to. They want a borderline all-star wing. A 3rd banana next to Ja and Jackson. They traded Jonas for Adams precisely so that they could develop Jackson further this year."
"Isn't that fucking wild? If you didn't already know, and someone asked you who made the most 3's in a game in Celtics history, who would answer Marcus Smart? Literally no one. Obviously the issue is that he's never been particularly consistent."
"Antoine Walker has a better career FG3% than Marcus Smart.      Career FG3% from basketball-reference.com:  32.0% - Marcus Smart  32.5% - Antoine Walker  36.8% - Paul Pierce  37.6% - Larry Bird  40.0% - Ray Allen"
"&gt; The 04 Pistons?   I like how I said about 19 of the last 21 and you just respond with a team and a question mark. What about all the teams with superstar scorers?   &gt; Look, the NBA pays role players to play great defense while providing minimal scoring. There are guys sitting overseas and out the league who can only score, while guys like Marcus Smart and Jrue Holiday make top dollar.  Lol it's because scoring can be a lot easier outside of the NBA. A borderline bench player should average at least 20ppg in China. Duncan Robinson just got a $90M contract so acting like guys don't get paid for shooting and scoring is ridiculous.   &amp;nbsp;  You also ignore that both of the players you mentioned had major injuries and are on the wrong side of 30. Another issue that Melo had to face was dealing with his change of role. You mentioned him getting blacklisted but he is in the league for his shooting and scoring."
"The 04 Pistons? Look, the NBA pays role players to play great defense while providing minimal scoring. There are guys sitting overseas and out the league who can only score, while guys like Marcus Smart and Jrue Holiday make top dollar.   Guys on the out at one point or another like IT and Melo were both blacklisted over defensive concerns. This is very basic basketball knowledge. Draymond Green can’t score at all and he’s flirting with a max bc of his defense/IQ."
"Marcus Smart. There are few people more determined than that dude, and his devopment has been fun to watch. Honorable mention to Jaylen.  Favorite nonCeltic is tough, too. Probably Giannis, but Jingles, Jokic, Tobi and Bobi, and a bunch of other dudes are just a joy to have in the NBA because they seem like fun, good people."
"My guy, it's Steph, KD, MJ, and Larry.  Klay, Allen, Miller. Great players. Have had insanely good shooting moments. But if we're basing it all on 3p and not the ability to generate a shot by themselves and score from anywhere on the floor, then by that logic Marcus Smart is better than Larry Bird lol.  Completely different era...if Bird played today he'd be amazing. Not Steph amazing but pretty close. No disrespect to Klay or Ray Allen or Reggie Miller but you're seriously disrespecting Larry Bird.  If Steph was in Klay's role for example, his percentages would be much better because he would be taking higher percentage shots more often. That's why it's hard to compare players like that. Klay suffers when he's the guy. So did Ray Allen. They excel off ball. Take a GOAT shooter and place then off ball and they'd do even better. Imagine MJ or KD or Steph or Larry off ball their whole career lol"
"I wouldn't say Marcus Smart making All Defense is that outlandish.  I'm gonna go off the rails and list my hot prediction takes for next season.  - 50% chance Westbrook will get traded in a blockbuster at the deadline for a 3P shooter if they're struggling during the regular season.  - The other 50% chance being the Lakers get eliminated in quarter finals again due to a combination of injuries, LeBron getting older and their lack of shooters if Westbrook doesn't get traded.  - The Bulls will make a convincing playoff run and be on the verge of eliminating a contender team in the semis, only to be reverse eliminated due to a heart breaking injury to one of DeRozan or Lavine at the worst timing possible.  - SGA will make All NBA third team.  - Kuzma will change his reputation and breakout as Washington's no 1 option. However, Washington doesn't make the playoffs.  - Klay Thompson will suffer another debilitating injury when he comes back, this time will be career threatening.  - Isaiah Thomas will be signed to a 10 day contract late in the season from a team decimated by injuries and proceed to still do nothing noteworthy.  - Jalen Suggs will emerge as the ROTY. Cade will have played better, but is ineligible due to injuries keeping him out of too many games.  - A package surrounding Ben Simmons will be eventually traded for CJ McCollum midway through the season, despite both front offices vehemently denying they're shopping either of them the entire time up to the trade.  - Donovan Mitchell will request a trade by the end of the season if the Jazz don't make it to the WCF at minimum."
Marcus Smart
bullshit marcus smart games are my absolute favorite games.
"You're underselling the theatre of it all lol. Its not the take that makes it great. Hell, r/nba has a million Ben Simmons sucks threads. I doubt any of those threads comes close to the absolute disrespect and simultaneous undeserved props that Max's take garnered.  For example, a vanilla version of Max's take would be ""Ben Simmon's is a destitute man's Jrue Holliday/Marcus Smart"". Add a lot more flavor and a couple martian death beams and you would have something resembling Max's take which is why its so great."
i saw some dude that looked like short asian marcus smart at the mall last week
Marcus Smart maybe
"Only 5 people have ever made more 3 pointers in a game than Marcus Smart. Just a fact, do with it what you must..."
Which part was the troll? Which part was untrue? You salty that your poverty franchise employs Ben Simmons? Celtics own the Flopadelphia Sixers and Marcus Smart would be the second best player on your team
The year we tanked with Jeff Green.   Our draft selection after that year? Marcus Smart.
 Marcus Smart is screaming in the Celtics locker room and there is a bunch of arguing going on. Smart comes out say “y’all on that bullshit!” Team is imploding. Smart is in bathroom and there is still screaming coming from locker room.
"Kemba + 16th pick for Horford:  - I didn't really like this deal at first, but once it was clear that OKC had to buy Kemba out, while not getting anything in return, makes me feel better. 16th pick for losing 8mil in salary + better fit + better defense + more future flexibility is....ok. Grade = C  Dennis Schroder:  - I don't know how this happened, but it's pretty amazing. We needed more offense and we needed another PG. The fact that we got a 12+mil player for half the price is amazing. He's not here long-term, but still amazing. Grade = A+  Williams extension:  - He is getting paid like Holmes. Advanced stats and Per 36 numbers suggest that Williams is at least on par with Holmes on both ends of the floor, so, in theory, it's fair value. If Williams stays healthy I think it will be an underpay, (much like Holmes contract). If Williams stays hurt, then he's overpaid, but by only 3ish mil per year imo, so still not horrible. I think this is a fair contract. Grade = B  Marcus Smart:  - I wouldn't look too much into his defensive decline last year. Everyone on the team struggled defensively and we had 0 consistency in terms of lineup. No one is talking about what did against the Nets, where he was clearly our 2nd best player night-in and night-out on both ends of the floor. His half-court play-making is severely underrated. His shooting is ass and will always be ass. He's cheaper than Ball and older than Ball, but I think there are things he does better and things he's worse at. I think this is a fair contract. Grade = B  Josh Richardson:  - Eh, not great. Not bad. He won't stick around next year, but he helps our defense, which was a middling one last year. He is part of a series of additions/subtractions that, in theory, should vault the C's defense back to top 5 status. I wanted more out of the TPE, but getting him for free ain't bad. Grade = C+  Kanter:  - Solid rebounder. Solid scorer. Solid defender against Embiid and big/lumbering centers. Otherwise, meh. He was cheap and will be our 3rd string center. I think we got him for cheaper than he is worth, so it was a good signing. Also, with Horford and Rob potentially missing games due to injury and age, we needed a 3rd stringer who could spot start reliably and Kanter can do that well. Grade = B+  TT for Dunn + 2nd rounder  - Lol I thought TT had negative value in a trade, so the fact we got positive value AND a cheaper contract, really nothing to complain about. I suspect Brad is looking to dump Dunn + someone else to get under the luxury tax, so Dunn isn't doing much for us. The real value is getting something for negative value imo. Grade = A  Draft  - I mean, we only had a 2nd rounder. He looks good, but will be overseas. I can't really give this a value yet. No idea what he's going to be. I lumped losing the 16th pick in with the Kemba deal, so this draft was....idk. Grade = Incomplete  Overall:  - I think it was a successful off-season overall. Our bench is better, our defense is better, and we are better suited to improve this team going forward. We got some good value players and re-signed guys on fair contracts, (I don't think either is overpaid or underpaid). That being said, I don't think we got fair value for the 16th pick, I don't think we are a title contender, and most of the good signings/acquisitions are likely gone by next year. I think we had an above average off-season, but not great and not on the fringes of great either. Just above average. Grade = B"
"I don't see Smart starting, actually. He's done so well running the bench mob, it might stay that way. Pritchard, Smart, Big Al, Nesmith, and Kanter, that's not a bad bench to have. Starters Dennis, Brown, Tatum, Time Lord. Ehm hmm, missing another elite wing there. Healthy Hayward please ;)   To be honest, I'm not sure who else is around ATM.   But some of those guys are pretty interchangeable, like Smart and Dennis might alternate starts. Al and Rob probably will as well. In some matchups Kanter might be good to start.  We could even see Dennis, Marcus, The J's and a center. Actually, that makes a lot of sense. I've always thought Smart is better at SG not PG.  We'll probably see some Big Al PG duty again, as well.  Where is Avery Bradley? He could be nice of the bench"
Marcus Smart
Kanter would have a solid team  **G:** Russell Westbrook  **G:** Dame Lillard   **F:** Jaylen Brown  **F:** Jayson Tatum  **C:** Kevin Durant  **Bench:** Marcus Smart / CJ McCollum / Carmelo Anthony / Serge Ibaka / Kristaps Porzingis / Jusuf Nurkic
"I mean, all Jrue does is play defense at this point. His offense has fallen off a cliff so hes in a similar role to Marcus Smart. He averaged high assists in the playoffs from bringing the ball up and dishing off but hes still an average playmaker. People arent gonna like this take because he just won the chip, but lets not act like he didnt underperform in the playoffs."
"He’s not a good screen setter from the 4 Celtics games I watched with him playing.  He gets open on lobs because the Celtics usually spam curl routes with Tatum while kemba handles and one of them finds a bad defender slacking or helping where they don’t need to.   His screening is actually really bad, and I doubt that he is going to get open like that with a marcus smart handler instead of a top 5% pr handler like kemba.   Maybe he’s better vs non-bucks/nets teams, but I doubt it."
Marcus smart not a steal. It was fine. Schroeder was a steal. Timelord is good.
Robert Williams and Marcus Smart totally put the celtics over the top! They might be able to sneak into the 7th seed this year! LMAO
It's been dead since the Marcus Smart extension. The only way to get Beal now is a sign and trade.
Marcus Smart will take 10 3s every game and hit either seven or one of them.  The block he had on Norm Powell down the stretch of game 7 doesn't get enough credit IMO.  That was an electrifying series even though it's clear we were a worse team that got lucky. However I genuinely do wonder if we could've made the finals that year if not for the pandemic alienating Siakam from his training.
Marcus Smart STEAL! 🤡  Le TimeLord STEAL!!! 🤡  Brad Stevens absolutely killin it so far lmaoooooo
And a newly-extended Marcus Smart. “I heard you guys want a PG who shoots more.”
"Marcus smart turning into prime steph curry in the 4th quarter of game 2 is way more ""luckier"" than anunoby hitting an open shot lol."
"Last season's garbage time Celtics consisting of Tremont Waters, Carsen Edwards, Tacko Fall, Grant Williams, and Semi Ojeleye. They'll win one game against the regular Celtics because Jayson Tatum gets COVID and Jaylen Brown injures his hand, leaving Marcus Smart as our only offensive option. He shoots 50 threes, hitting only 25% of them."
Marcus Smart really could’ve been the number 1 pick if he came out in 2013 instead of going back to college
For me- marcus smart
Marcus Smart: flopping
"Terry has had 2 perfectly fine scoring seasons for the Hornets at that salary level. They are different but Terry is a more valuable skill set. ""Impacts winning"" is a meme. Tatum and Jalen impact winning Marcus Smart is along for the ride doing what he can"
"Over my many years of watching basketball, i’ve come to find that “impacts winning” is somewhat of a buzzword that is dependent on what the rest of your team looks like. For the Celtics, Marcus Smart absolutely does, but on a team that doesn’t already have all-star scoring threats, I wouldn’t be 100% sure."
"in 2021 that's 5 20 ppg scorers and then Al Horford, Marcus Smart, Daniel Theis, Morris who are starter quality players who play both good offense and defense   the timing wasn't right for the team especially with the Hayward injury and Tatum and Brown not being good enough yet"
Marcus Smart is a hustle role player. Terry is an efficient 20ppg scorer. They aren't in the same tier at all..
"None of them are guaranteed, but when you include like you'd need like 10 different East guards this year for something to happen that probability chance of each independent event multiplied by each other the end result ends up being negligibly small.  So sure, if Marcus Smart ends up with better counting stats than almost all of Trae, Jrue, Simmons, Brown, Lowry, Lonzo, DeRozan, Lamelo, Rozier, Brogdon, FVV, Dinwiddie, Cunningham , etc than sure, but at that point the argument is asinine.  This isn't about an evaluation on Marcus Smart btw, this is just how the All-star selection heuristic goes. If you are the third best player on a team, you *better* be THE best team in basketball (highly unlikely) or else you have a massively uphill battle. 1st options on bad teams get picked over 3rd best options on solid teams. That's just how it goes.  &gt;No one thought Mo Williams in ‘09 would be an all star.  Because the East in 09 was terrible so it was the best out of a bunch of bad choices. There are much better more likely alternatives this year.  Also im not even sure Smart will even be #3 in usage this year with Dennis probably soaking up a ton of bench usage. I see him with a higher PPG than Smart even with one of Brown/Tatum injured just through pure shot creation skills."
I love Marcus Smart. But no. Not all-star. (But defensive first team all day long.)
I mean they just signed Schroeder and Marcus Smart combined for about 3 million more then Rozier will make. I’ll take Schroeder and Smart.
"&gt; but I don't see the point of talking up Danny's acumen if he wasn't really able to accrue those benefits from the pick.  Because it shows he's a good evaluator of talent?   In 5 consecutive years, he drafted Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and Robert Williams.   All 5 of those guys are going to be making at least 15 mill per year starting next year and are all Top 100 players in the league."
"Marcus Smart for now, could be all time as well"
Marcus Smart
Marcus Smart
"Projection is literally what the draft is.  If day 1 quality was all that mattered, Brandon Roy would have gone 1st. Buddy Hield would have gone 1st. Victor Oladipo goes 1st (good decision in this case). Marcus Smart might have gone 1st. Obi Toppin possibly goes 1st."
"you're ignoring the context of this chain of comments, which was me replying to someone saying you could get 75% of FVV at half the price. my comment was referring to the fact that you could also indeed, get 75% of Marcus Smart at half the price as well, because the foundation of his skillset (hustle and defence), really isn't that rare"
Why did I think Marcus smart was like 35
"It’s funny how you never know who’s actually going to be a great defender heading into the draft.  I’m watching this Marcus Smart video with R2 Bball and I remember at OK state and at no point did I think he’d be an elite NBA defender.  I remember Pat Bev at Arkansas, and they always talked about how he averaged like 37 in HS, not his defense.  The knock on Draymond was he had high IQ but who can he guard.  I always wondered how players work on defense, it’s not as simple as try to stay in front your guy. But really try to take away everything they want to do."
"- Jayson Tatum  - Jaylen Brown  - Marcus Smart  - Robert Williams  - Payton Pritchard  - Aaron Nesmith  - Dennis Schroder  - Romeo Langford  Al would be nice to keep, but if he's taken that means we get off of his contract. Richardson isn't a long-term player for us. The rest of the young guys can go."
"Yeah I think he’d be less versatile defensively, but potentially a better on ball offensive player. There won’t be an exact comp, but Marcus smart-type and caliber"
"I love that part about the media. Dude pretty much realized that he was *playing* the game at a high level while everyone else was only *talking* about it.     Like in that Marcus Smart thread where people were saying his defensive technique was bad or not the best. Like dude, that guy plays defense on Curry, Kyrie, Harden and has shown can make them have difficult nights - I think his technique is probably much better than yours is."
What do you think is a reasonably optimistic outcome for him? Like a Marcus smart?
I wonder where Marcus smart would benefit from that on a list. He seemed to be the go to guy for last second shots that nobody else wanted
you can tell he enjoys teaching. i like Marcus smart
not drinking homer juice. i like marcus smart. he’s objectively not as good as the other two guys i mentioned. that’s literally all i’m saying lol
Marcus Smart
"i met him once at a shake shack and bro legitimately has a comic book superhero physique in real life. it was like seeing superman, only superman wearing a tshirt of marcus smart dunking"
"&gt;If they have a weakness, it's the inability of the backcourt to get stops, primarily players like Trae Young and Lou Williams.  &gt;Playoff teams will probably always work to get Young or Williams on a switch before attacking, so exploring a trade for a big, defensive-minded guard (a la Marcus Smart) would do a lot for this roster.   Lmao this is actually so fucking dumb I cant believe these ppl get paid to write.   1. Trae and Lou will never play together (and actually they did IN THE PLAYOFFS and teams couldnt take advantage)   2. Yeah just go for the switch right? Tell that to the Knicks/Sixers/Bucks who did that maybe a grand total of 3 times. It's so easy and such a good strategy right?   3. Trading for Marcus Smart as if we don't already got ppl to cover for Trae smfh. That's the entire point of our roster construction"
You cant compare 6'4 brick house body type Marcus Smart to a 6 foot tall Dame. At a certain point size matters a lot.
"Marcus is 27.  Rondo was highly valued just last year.  Beverly has lasted in the league for a long time.  Smart still has 4 more years easily before his value starts to diminish.  Bradley was rumored to be going back to team he had previously played for, meaning there was interest in him, and I highly suspect he will sign with a team before the season starts.  I also think that the value on Bledsoe is at all time low, but he's really not that bad.  But he's also 31, 4 years older then Marcus, so if he's starting to decline that's understandable, but all signs point to Marcus having another 4 good years on him before there are any real normal sign of falling off amongst players of his type.  Multiple of which, would have 8 more years of play in the league, if they were Marcus' age."
"Draymond Green, Marcus Smart and Pat Bev where/ are seen as the heart of their teams despite not being the best player on the team"
"When Marcus Smart is your only good guard, it is"
"Kevin can Love, Marcus is Smart, Jaylen’s skin is the color Brown, Demarcus has Cousins"
The funny part was Marcus smart was just talking to no one about defense for 30 mins before this and they just started recording
Can we have Marcus Smart  We have Marcus Smart at home  [Marcus Smart at home](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E4ikSZxWEAMXh_t?format=jpg&amp;name=small)
We're getting last year's Marcus Smart at the outlet store
“Mom can we have Marcus Smart?”
"I don’t think that would do it. We need a stretch 5 but losing Marcus would open up other holes. He’s the leader and defensive anchor of the team, so his value goes well beyond salary. The closest comparison I can think of is Draymond Green, so the value he provides the Celtics would make the asking price quite high.  Many fans might disagree with my assessment but I think it’s evident that Celtic management puts a ton of stock in Smart. I can’t really imagine a trade scenario that makes either team very happy."
No one is talking about Marcus Smart here except you.
"can NBA fans please explain ""toughness"" to me, is it just another word to give to players that are beloved but not really that amazing? e.g. marcus smart"
Are you comparing Jaylen Brown(stud) with Marcus Smart?
Who do you see willing to pay almoat 20 a year for Marcus Smart?
"I dunno how you can say Graham has 0 synergy with Zion and BI before ever seeing them play, stats and numbers never tell the entire story. Like just wait and chill damn lol  You can call the Hart signing an overpay but you have to take care of your guys at some point, not every Celtics fan is happy with the Marcus Smart deal but he’s *their guy* so they get it"
"So then how do you define top? You just said it’s subjective, Jrue and Khris CAN be top 30 players or not. If that’s subjective, the whole superteam definition is too.  If I consider Marcus Smart a top 30 player, are the Celtics a superteam? Does my subjective favoritism of Ant, KAT, and DLo elevate the Twolves to that status?"
"I basically have came with the terms with the fact that they're going to use Marcus Smart as a Ricky Rubio-type this season and they'll just see what happens.  I still love the fit of Rubio on the Celtics but he's making 17M this year and isn't easy to trade for. He's an expiring though, so if the Celtics really want to they can just try to get him for something cheaper next off-season."
"Hell, even old man Sheed on the Cs absolutely cooked in the post. Dunno if his body would have held up to a lot of post play, but I still believe he could have helped that Cs team win it that year.  Maybe not, but that series was so close, and Sheed launched threes like bad Marcus Smart."
"Celtics FANS love Marcus Smart.  He's our guy  Boston sports media can go fuck itself - except for Big Jim, he rules and is exempt"
you just named two guys who are better than Marcus Smart and one of them makes significantly less
I remember there was an article a few weeks ago about how “sources familiar with Brad Stevens thinking say that a Marcus Smart trade is imminent”  Lol. Never leave Marcus ❤️
Extending Marcus Smart pretty much means Brad does not care about Beal.
"I am *so sick* of people talking about Rubio as a player for us. He's *really not that good as a half-court playmaker,* because despite his passing skill he's an even worse scorer than Marcus Smart."
"I feel that, for the right price, any team in the NBA would want Marcus Smart. I feel like Boston is a great fit and home for him too."
"I'm biased but I would say his summer league was far beyond decent. As impressive as his offensive numbers were (15/3/3/ on 53/50/87 shooting), his defensive play was perhaps even more impressive. To me he really looks like another Marcus Smart type of PG/SG, I think he'll be a major steal"
Marcus Smart worth 19m a year?
Because it’s hilarious that he went from starting on the best team in the league to backing up marcus smart on a play in squad.  We want to see how low it can go.   Maybe he can be the 4th guard on the kings on the min next year.
"Lol but why tho  This is... Marcus Smart we're talking about, right?"
"Boston sports radio doesn't necessarily hate Marcus Smart, they just hate Marcus Smart being paid like he is by the Celtics. They think he should be paid half as much, or that he's overrated on defense.  It's a mess to listen to sometimes."
"? I didn’t say anything about defensive rAtings or anything. Marcus smart is living on his defensive reputation and was fairly mediocre last season, especially compared to 3ish seasons ago. Lonzo is actually a decent defender based entirely on watching games. Marcus smart 3 years ago might bring a culture of defense but I didn’t see that in the last 1.5 seasons at all."
"Look, ik Dennis played pretty poorly last season, but Marcus smart is not worth 72 mil more than Dennis."
"Does he really still have four years left in the tank? I know teams overpay star vets on these kind of contracts—the first year or two can make overpaying later worth it—but I’m not sure Marcus Smart, as much as I like him, fits that category."
Do they really hate Marcus Smart? He's like the perfect player to appeal to Celtics fans. All the other fans hate him.
"Yes and Lonzo filled the Bulls need for a PG, so that lowers the number of teams who have the need for Marcus Smart great enough to pay him that much.  And I’m exclusively referring to this offseason, way too many things could change from now to next year"
&gt; any team that would pay over 80m for Marcus Smart.  Lonzo just got $80M and the cap is going up $7m next offseason. Guys contracts are going to keep going up.
Marcus Smart is one of those players that it would be weird to see in another jersey imo
Keep up that talk while we are in the second round and y’all get swept by the nets or bucks. And please is see plenty of comparisons of Jayson Tatum being close to Luka. Still don’t get how in your mind. Two guys in jayson and jaylen who are in your opinion way better than our 2nd guy and Marcus smart who is apparently better than our 2nd guy leads to a .500 average while we were at .568 in the west vs the East.
I don’t think a team led by Marcus Smart is going anywhere. What am I missing?   He seems like a souped up Pat Beverley.
Marcus Smart
"Kobe, Iverson, Tony Allen for past players   Currently Marcus Smart and Draymond Green for me fit that bill the most"
don't you mean you hope your guys Marcus smart about it? I'll see myself out
"Marcus Smart and IT4, from my team at least"
"Surprised not to see Marcus Smart on the list, are they maybe not counting out of bounds saves?"
Teams don’t completely leave Marcus Smart but to say he’s guarded like he’s a 40% shooter is a huge stretch
This also why Marcus Smart is a 3&amp;D player despite his 3 being lackluster for many seasons. Defenses guarded him like he shot 40% for some reason even though he’d shoot like 32%
Height means literal 0 when it comes to post defense. All about your base Robinson had great position and made Ben move exactly where he wanted him to and Ben had no moves in his bag to counter it. That’s why Marcus smart can guard the 1-5 in the paint and also jrue holiday guarding KD and kyrie look at certain possessions and you’ll see
"See: Marcus Smart. There was a really good article like 3 years ago about how even though he was a bad shooter his chucking was still helpful to the offense in general, but I can't find it rn."
"Those weren't on the table. The most the celtics offered was Marcus Smart and picks. The most the sixers offered was Covington, Saric, and picks. Kawhi killed his trade value to an extent no other star has done in recent years."
"He was sniffing around and trying to make trades for good players like D-Lo, Simmons, and Marcus smart. Very un-Minnesota like of him. He had to be cut before he made the team too good."
He has a great potential to be the next Marcus Smart
"Danny Ainge built a team with Kyrie Irving, Gordon Hayward, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Al Horford, Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris, Aron Baynes, Daniel Theis, and Robert Williams.  At some point the GM can only do so much. Danny Ainge did everything in his power to start a dynasty, it just didn't work out for non-front office reasons."
"&gt;Would you rather have a $35 million dollar distraction, or someone like...Marcus Smart?  Don't you put that evil on the Celtics."
"This is huge, if it's true.   Instead of Morey (at least trying) to demand a king's ransom for an all star player, he may have to give up assets (picks) to move Simmons' salary.   Would you rather have a $35 million dollar distraction, or someone like...Marcus Smart? Not necessarily him but that caliber of player. And at this point Philly needs to toss in a pick to sweeten the deal"
"It's probably less blasphemous than it used to be, but  ""Marcus Smart is better than Ben Simmons""  ...or, if you want a less insane-sounding version of this take so you can understand my reasoning:  ""I would rather have Marcus Smart on my team in Game 7 of a playoff series than Ben Simmons, because I think Marcus Smart gives you a better chance of winning that specific kind of game"""
Marcus Smart; if he can keep up the defensive intensity and become a more pass first point guard the Celtics can be amazing.
And it’s not like they hired like a lloyd pierce level guy just because he was black. Udoka is a great coach who would have been a strong contender for the job whether jaylen made this request or not  Also one of brads biggest weakness as a coach was an inability to relate to and connect with a lot of his players. You could tell after the marcus smart locker room meltdown game in the bubble that they stopped really listening to him. Hiring a guy who has that shared experience of not only being a former player but also being a black man is exactly what this team needed
Is Marcus smart beloved by anybody that isn't a Celtics fan?
"Great observation. Some other minor ones come to mind (Marcus Smart was a dirty player in college, Vince Carter hated for his Toronto exit) but not the total 180 that JJ had."
That's the strangest defense mechanism I think I've ever seen and my favorite player is Marcus Smart. Congratulations to you
My barber is Marcus Smart's barber.  Also saw Smart at our local YMCA supporting the league.
"Lakers flair so they'll probably say Bird is lower.  Even though Bird was pretty much the consensus better player through 1987, outside of LA, and that time period makes up the majority of both guys' respective careers.  Lakers had the better team for the decade, because Kareem &gt; Parish, Worthy &gt; McHale and Wilkes/Klay's Dad &gt; Celtics Walton. DJ &gt; Nixon/Scott, but not enough to outweigh everything else. Cooper vs Ainge is hard to compare - it's like Marcus Smart vs Tyler Herro."
If anyone actually believes that they haven't seen Marcus Smart or PJ Tucker play before
"Not to negate what you did do, but I wanted to comment on something I would've liked to see happen that didn't.  First, I'll say that if Murray was healthy I thought y'all were the team to beat in the West last year (with AD being limited). Your core 4 are very complementary.  But the lineup does have its weaknesses (mainly guard defense). That's where I think the off-season priority should've been. Had I been the Nuggets GM, I'd have pushed pretty hard to see if I could make a trade centered around Monte for Marcus Smart before he signed his extension. (I think Boston would've done this, maybe with picks involved, because they need a true PG more than they need Smart, and I'm high on Monte as a starting PG)  I know y'all love Monte but I think a starting/closing 5 of Murray/Smart/MPJ/Gordon/Jokic is stacked and fits like a glove. Barton would crush in a 6th man role IMO. Facu is still a better backup PG than many teams have. The rest of your acquisitions are still possible in this scenario.  Yes it might be a bit rough until Murray gets healthy, but IMO you should be building for the eventual best version of the team."
"&gt;Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are great players, no one is denying that, but Brown is coming off of injuries and I don't think he is going to be any better than last season, more of the same with probably a slower start to the season  Brown's injury wasn't major and he got surgery early so that he would be ready for this upcoming season. You're making a bigger deal of his injury than it really is. And Brown has made massive leaps every year (outside of 2019 for obvious reasons, that whole team was a mess).  Jaylen Brown PPG/FG% from his rookie year until now:  2016/17: 6.6/45%  2017/2018: 14.5/47%  2018/2019 (outlier for obvious reasons): 13.0/47%  2019/2020: 20.3/47%  2020-2021: 24.7/48% (both career highs)  It's clear he's made massive leaps basically every year and is still young, it's more likely he takes a leap since he isn't even in his prime yet...He's going to be a much better player this year than he was last year  &gt; I'm not as high on Tatum as most everyone else is, he is a fantastic player, but I don't see him as one of the next faces of the league.  You're underrating Tatum. Not much to say here, but get prepared to eat your words lol. He's 23 and already a top 12 player. This year he's going to be top 10. Keep sleeping on him though  &gt;Marcus smart is fantastic, but I don't necessarily like having him be the guy having to run the offense much at all, but regardless he is still elite defensively and has proven he can shoot to a certain degree in this league  Both Tatum/Brown's numbers were much better with only Smart on the court and not Kemba (they both scored more and on higher %'s) last year. Smart becoming the full time PG is a good thing. He is a mix bag I'll give you that, but Smart is a good player overall because of everything he brings like you said (defense and is a streaky shooter)  &gt;Dennis Schroder is the antithesis of Marcus Smart. He is going to be a negative on defense, but bring in a scoring touch off the bench, but if he shares the floor with the two star forwards, I see him taking opportunities away from them.  Schroder isn't a negative on defense overall. I do agree his defense is overhyped, but to say he is a negative is a little overkill. Guys like IT, Kemba, Trae are negatives on defense, not Schroder. And he's not taking shots away from the Jays lmao, we need MORE good players who can get baskets and create for themselves. I don't think you have ever watched the Celtics lol. Kemba is gone which means we need another scorer who can give us between 15-20 PPG like Kemba did, and Schroder can do that. Schroder off the bench is a major weapon for the Celtics, he's super underrated just because he had a few bad playoff games with an injured Lakers team.  &gt;I just don't like his fit necessarily with this roster.  Again, you don't really follow/know the Celtics lol. We fixed a lot of our issues this offseason. We have a better big man rotation (Horford/Williams/Kanter&gt;&gt;&gt;Theis/Williams/Kornet) which allows us a lot of versatility now because of Horford. With Horford we can start him at the 5 (Smart/Richardson (or Nesmith)/Brown/Tatum/Horford is a lineup that can switch everything on defense and play 5 out offensively. We also have Williams who has a lot of potential and is starting to put it together. He gives us a massive shot-blocking/lob presence on defense/offense. We also have a stronger bench with Schroder as the 6th man and Williams (or Horford) off the bench. We have a bunch of 2nd year players with promise as well (I personally think Nesmith is going to be a key role player for us this year, and maybe Pritchard as well)  &gt;I see potential with Josh Richardson, but I'm not sure if that potential is going to come to fruition with this team nd the role that will be asked of him.  For once, I agree with you. I have no idea how the JR experiment will go  &gt;I am not a believer in Robert Williams either. It feels like he has barely played and the Boston fans are already saying he is a top tier center in the making. I personally don't see anything more than a lower end starting caliber center from him  Once again, you're underrating him lol. Injuries are 100% a real concern with him no question, but his talent/impact is there when he is healthy. He has a Clint Capela career type, and that is not low end lol. He had 9 blocks in a single game in the playoffs last year, he's special  &gt;Horford is a imo going to just be decent for short stretches, the guy is getting old.  He's still good, go watch him in OKC. They shut him down because they didn't want to win games...  I'll come back to this comment once the regular season ends don't worry!"

"&gt; They did NOT pay him a supermax.  They paid him more than a max -- you're getting into semantics, supermax isn't actual CBA terminology.    Comparing Ben Simmons to Marcus Smart is something.  Simmons has the eye test and the statistics to back up his impact on the court.  He had a bad series against us and he got into a mental funk that if he can fix (big if), he's absolutely worth the max.  He's a walking mismatch on offense and defense.  He's nothing like Marcus Smart."
"What are your thoughts about our possible lineup. Smart / Langford / Jaylen / Jayson / Horf eventually Rob. Thats top 10 defense. Three reliable shooter, one is promising and the other is Marcus Smart. Then Dennis / Jrich / Neismith / Jabari / Juancho. Lol are we bad? Im confident we can beat all teams in the east except for the Nets and Bucks. Thoughts?"
"&gt; Hawks young core is significantly better than yours and improving.   Now it is, it wasn't in 2019.   In 2019, we had a 9-man rotation of Kyrie, JT, JB, Horford, Hayward, Smart, Rozier, Marcus Morris, Baynes (before he was washed).   We were the 3rd Vegas favorite for the *championship*.   Goes to show you that one Conference Finals appearance means jackshit as far as significance for the next season."
"Scoring, efficiency, health  Look I love Marcus Smart and glad he’s on my team, but let’s also be realistic here. The guy is going into his 8th season, we know what he is. On his best day he’s 1st team defense and a solid starter. Not likely he will ever make an All-Star team so “borderline all-star” with this 538 metric is being very generous."
"Marcus Smart borderline all Star, Pascal Siakam average starter.   Ok 538…"
"I'll take Marcus Smart with Booker, Vuc, Sabonis"
"Marcus Smart as borderline all star in the same category as Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Nikola Vucevic, Domantas Sabonis, Devin Booker, De’Aaron Fox, Donovan Mitchell, and Bradley Beal?  I’m sorry but yeah fucking right, okay buddy lmao  This is why you don’t just rely on analytics alone"
Marcus smart is not a borderline all star
"Putting aside how overused the ""pass-first point guard"" cliche is (nearly every PG in the league these days is a combo guard, and the ones who aren't are guys like Rubio, who aren't good enough to start on good teams anyway), we *have* a pass-first PG. His name is Marcus Smart, he would've been top 30 in assists last year if he'd played enough to qualify, and the only reason he's been playing the two-guard is because we've had a star-level PG since his sophomore year. And don't give me that ""he takes too many bad shots to be a pass-first PG"" crap— the only guy who averaged *more* assists than him last year while taking *fewer* shots per game were Draymond Green, Ricky Rubio, Ben Simmons, and TJ McConnell."

"Starters: Curry/Paul George/Tatum/Giannis/Capela   Bench: Malcolm Brogdon/Wiggins/RoCo/MPJ/Myles Turner  Monte Morris/Marcus Smart  I tried not to go too crazy with the players. Most of them are decent defenders, and the versatility both on offense and defense is insane. The starting lineup is centered around the gravity of Steph and Giannis, who can create open looks for PG and Tatum. Capela is there mostly for defense, to provide a strong paint protector who’s still decently switchable. The bench lineup is much of the same, and can function both on its own or mixed in with the starters. I also included two solid backup guards in case Curry hurts his ankle ☹️."

"probably perimeter. a good perimeter defender like kawhi or marcus smart almost eliminates the need for anything more than just average paint D, as we saw with the clippers and celtics, who both did pretty well given their lack of a great big last season (i love time lord but he didn't play enough to count).  basically, if you have good perimeter defense it lowers the minimum requirement for paint defense, but not vice versa."
Marcus Smart is known as one of the best defenders yet gets snubbed for All Defense all the time...he did grab a couple first teams though
Marcus Smart is a great rim protector for a guard but he's just average for a big.
"“Random ass play” are you dumb and/or do you not know anything about basketball? Smart is our point guard, and a defensive beast. Smart getting a steal and passing to Tatum for a dunk is called a transition dunk- a dunk, in transition from defense to offense. This is a reasonably frequent situation on the Celtics.   Also “nerdy ass try hard” lmao don’t be jealous that “Marcus smart fuckery” is the best you could come up with, why don’t you log off Reddit for the morning buddy and just take this L"
Who tf is supposed to recognize some random ass play as Marcus smart traveling fucking nerdy ass try hard😂
"Wasn’t trying to make it rhyme “bum”, was trying to stick with the methods of travel, as in the original statement. Wtf type of method of travel is “Marcus smart fuckery”?"
"A few seasons back Marcus Smart was one of the best defenders in the league, guarding 1-5, and was still barely a DPOY candidate. You just can't really break into it these days from the Guard position."
"Right when I post that, Marcus Smart tweets “Takes  little “talent” to play defense. Takes a wholelotta “want to”.”  I think this goes to show anybody can play great defense, just gotta have the drive.  Much respect to the great players like Jordan and Stockton."
"Couldn’t even make it rhyme bum how about one if by land, two if by sea, three if by Marcus smart fuckery."
"If any guard was going to do it, it would be him or Marcus Smart. So why not?"
I fucking love Marcus Smart
"He played a lot more like Marcus Smart than OG, except he was 3 inches taller."
Man fuck Marcus smart bitch ass “king of the north” head ass
"You can develop your floor though, even if you're not great. Danny Green has lost some of the athleticism he had but he's still a good-ish defender most of the time.  Part of the equation is what can you focus on improving.  Like is it worth the effort for Marcus Smart to become a great ball handler and spend less time on other traits?"
He’s right. But it’s also still a skill that needs to be honed. If you got into an NBA game and matched up with Marcus Smart you aren’t going to guard him just by how hard you want it.
"Holy shit, I just became a Marcus Smart fan"

"The closest guy to Derrick White I can think of is Marcus Smart. Great defender, takes a lot of charges, one of the best shot blocking guards in the entire league, and can switch on to a decent amount of 3s. Offensively he's pretty good at running pick and rolls and can shoot from outside but isn't great at it. He can play 1 or 2 offensively and I think if he was playing next to an athletic big like Jarrett Allen, his pick and roll game would be great.  If he's healthy this season, he'll probably be the best player on the spurs. Even Pop said he was the most important player on the team like 2 years ago."
nah thats what people say about marcus smart type players. bobby is universally loved
"Versatility, being the best defensive player on the team, having a good but not great rim protector, consistently and successfully guarding the opposing team's best wing/guard player in the clutch, high impact metrics, good counting stats (steals, blocks, rebounds) and leadership (teammates play harder on D when he's on the court).  So basically Marcus Smart and Thybulle if he was on another team."
Marcus Smart about get the super max.
"Fuck Andrew Bynum, fuck Jared Dudley, fuck Marcus Smart and fuck Markelle Fultz.   But most of all, fuck Ben Simmons."
"You're falling exactly into what I was saying earlier about three point shooting.   I could make a highlight of Marcus Smart hitting tough threes, stepbacks, off the dribble, 30 footers, fade aways. Then I could say ""this clip shows that he has the ability to be Steph Curry, if he puts his energy into shooting more"".   Say a guy is just guessing whether a defender is going left or right. 50% of the time they look like Kawhi. 50% of the time they get blown by. Thats a really, really bad defender. But that highlight reel would look nice.   Maybe Gordon can be great but this clip means nothing."
"Maybe. But I'd also add that its more of a skill that needs to be developed than a pure effort thing. Being locked in for 35 minutes, always positioned correctly. Its tough.   He can try as hard as he wants but if he isn't positioned correctly, his footwork isn't developed and he doesn't have the BBIQ and concentration to consistently read the play then he will never be elite.    An extreme example, but James Harden can't just try harder and be Marcus Smart on defense. The same way that Smart can't just try harder on offense and be James Harden. There's skill and feel involved."
"Think it’d be a team award type thing. Like if the Celtics had the # 1 defense, Marcus Smart would get votes."
Marcus Smart - 17 mil annually  OG Anunoby - 17 mil annually   I’m sure there are other examples but those are premium defenders who are more productive offensively than Gordon as well. This contract is always going to be an overpay.
"Some people don't get that defense is about consistency. It is like shooting ability.   People post highlights to prove defensive ability. I could post a highlight of Marcus Smart splashing threes. That doesn't make him a great shooter because I'm editing out the 67% that he clangs.   Rob Williams might have one of the best defensive highlight reels in the NBA. He isn't close to prime Al Horford as a defender, because Al made very few mistakes. Rob still makes mistakes (although less than he used to).   Aaron Gordon isn't a bad defender. He is useful. And his size with good defense is valuable. But this clip makes him look like a DPOY candidate."
"Lonzo Ball? James Harden? Marcus Smart? Patrick Beverley? PG is the weakest position defensively but ""no PGs play defense"" is ridiculous lol"
"Or, to summarize, we could just call it ""The Marcus Smart"""
"i disagree and i think it's a huge disconnect between fans/this sub and NBA FOs.  it is not easy to be horrible and tank when you have decent players on the roster.  good players don't want to lose - there is very little incentive for them to do it.  ben simmons on the rockets last year would've wanted to show off his talent and put up big numbers as the main guy.  i'm not saying he would've carried his team to the postseason, but the rockets prob don't have the worst record in the league with him on the team.  if you think a team can tank just as easily with good players on the roster as they can with terrible players, there's no talking to you because it's like we're speaking different languages.  when the celtics traded pierce and KG to the nets for that haul of picks, there were some fans who were disappointed we didn't get any good players in return.  i remember saying that if they're not gonna win now, they should have as few win-now players on the roster to commit to a tank for a couple years.  the celtics ended up being pretty bad, getting the 6th overall pick, and drafting marcus smart.  if they had gotten some decent players in return instead of picks, the celtics would probably be in way worse shape today as a result.  IMO the harden to the rockets trade is completely indefensible; the only reason in the world i can think of that Presti doesn't deserve total hate for it is if his hand was forced by ownership.  but I'm not in these FOs and can only speculate about that kinda thing, so as a result I'm gonna blame the GM who gave away a perennial MVP candidate entering his prime for nothing.  that is completely inexcusable.  he could've had harden, KD, and westbrook all in their primes for years.  or even if he had moved on from westbrook, KD and Harden would've been a way better fit than Westbrook and KD were."
"This season Marcus Smart is averaging 7 3PA a game and is making them at....(wait for it..) 23.5%  Why in gods name is Smart taking so many threes. Also if Tatum is awful the Celtics suck.   This game was a difference in depth. Tatum and Beal were both trash but the Wiz have too much depth. JB was also really bad this game.   The Celtics last guy on the rotation is a washed Jabari Parker, Grant Williams, Josh Richardson compared to the Wiz who are running the rookie Corey Kispert who actually looks really solid so far on both ends of the court, Deni Avdija who also plays solid D and can ball handle, Aaron Holiday who is looking like a steal of a pick-up for PG depth and Bertans who is still capable of being a good NBA player even though he's been pretty bad at doing what he's paid to do which is shoot the ball. Juancho needs to work his way into the rotation for Boston, he's a solid player."
Marcus Smart
"I mean why wouldn't a player foul bait when it was allowed.   For example, I think flopping sucks as a viewer but if I was an nba player, I'd flop more than Marcus smart lmao"
Schroder is going to make Marcus Smart completely redundant by the trade deadline. Book it.
Jayson hasn't quite been enough. You can bench Marcus Smart while he's cold and cobble together something. You can't bench Tatum while he's cold
"swap marcus smart with a pure pg and they would be better in my opinion, i don’t understand how jaylen could be hot and the offense proceeds to ignore him for maybe ten straight possessions, good example of this is the knicks game"
"Same effect Marcus Smart has on the game, but with better playmaking and shooting. As a Celtics fan I'd be ecstatic if Smart could play like Lowry over his tenure"
I thought Dante Exum would be a stud and make a couple All Star games for the Jazz. A dud if anything. He wasn't even the best aussie on our team lol. Should've drafted Marcus Smart instead.
Marcus smart would cook you and your little LA fitness squad. Mf think shit is sweet until they actually step on the court with nba talent.

"And Marcus Smart. I remember wanting the Lakers to get him and was so disappointed he was picked by the Celtics right before.  It’s also a shame Lakers let Randle go for nothing, even if he was seen as a black hole stat stuffer, you could tell he had the tools and mentality to be a productive olayer. I didn’t expect him to be the version he is on the Knicks, but also not surprised"
I thought frank ntkilna would be comparable to marcus smart
"Advanced stats aren't everything.  Kyrie and AD look great by the advanced stats yet anyone who follows them knows they are not, and never will be, the guy.  You simply cannot quantify the fact that some players elevate everyone around them. LeBron does this better than anyone I've ever seen. Another notable mention would be Tim Duncan. Players who do what is necessary to win, who don't care about ruining a good statline to elevate the team.  A good example of this would be Marcus Smart (though obviously not even close to the same degree of the aforementioned 2), whose defensive metrics look often worse than they are because he chooses to make everyone else's jobs easier by guarding the opponent's best non big player. Makes the team better, gives Brown and Tatum more energy on offense, makes their jobs easier on defense, but you cannot quantify that impact.  So my tldr is that advanced stats are overrated and the best players are the ones who contribute to winning the most. Oftentimes a good role player who can elevate 2 all stars is more important to a team than a 3rd all star who wants the ball, unless of course that 3rd all star is someone who legitimately makes winning plays and puts the team first. Unpopular opinion so don't kill me thanks."
"Not really struggling to get by his man, it's usually when he meets big man that's the issue with him at the rim.  Midrange - I think he just likes the shot honestly. If he's open he'll take it. They aren't like heavily contested, he just hasn't been knocking them down yet.  Handle - it was rough in the preseason and he got tipped/picked a lot, especially against Marcus Smart and Dejounte Murray. It's been much better in the regular season, but it's definitely something he needs to work on. I like having keeping him at the 2 for this season because of that."
The Marcus smart experience
I think you and I both know that Marcus Smart would cook you in every conceivable way.
I could guard Marcus Smart better than he guards LaMelo. Dude sits there ignored all game and goes 1-9 from 3 lol. Tatum and Jaylen deserve better guard play than him
"Marcus Smart made a whole bunch of Marcus Smart plays and he is the only reason that game even went to OT.  Celtics were down 10 with 5 minutes left.  Yes he was awful shooting last night, but that's all part of Smart.  Bottom line is the boxscore never reveals what Smart brings to the table, but he was very much a part of that win."
Why is Marcus Smart talking shit for holding LaMelo to 50% 3pt shooting when Tatum and brown hard carried his scrub ass to the win lmao.

That’s Marcus smart? Why does he look so much darker than usual
"This, plus the bricked catch-and-shoot triple he had right before it, sums up Marcus Smart in a nutshell."
"Hey teams playing the celtics, please keep inbounding and keep going after Marcus Smart. It'll turn out great for you guys ;)"
Marcus Smart is a Stupidly Amazing Defender.
"Marcus Smart is going to do Marcus Smart things, you'd think Hayward would know this already."
Over his career Marcus Smart has taken roughly 5 3pt FGA Per Game at a whopping 32% !!! 32% !!!!  He shoots the ball soooo much 😭😭
Marcus Smart is the GOAT of that shit Lmao
Thats why hes Marcus Smart and not Marcus Tough
Now I'm just imagining Marcus Smart with 3-4 more inches in height and wondering if he'd be better or worse than Draymond.. that'd be an interesting player
"Marcus Smart does as well. The more I learn about those two, the more similar they seem"
So many of those games were won in the weirdest of ways too.  G1: Raptors lose to themselves from the get go  G2: Marcus Smart turns into Steph  G3: Buzzer beater   G5: Raptors lose to themselves  G6: Double OT  But yeah that was an elite series.
"sadly the classification seems to have more to due with how long it takes the guy to get up, and how much he writhes around on the floor, than how bad the foul was. this guy bounced up so the refs just moved on.  Marcus Smart, meanwhile, would have been on the ground for 3 minutes minimum and i guarantee the refs would have reviewed the play in response."
Marcus Smart is ready to fight all of them
He has a Marcus smart flair. His opinion on BS plays should be ignored lol
"These matchup stats can be misleading, but he has actually looked elite on ball so far this season. The way he navigates screens and moves laterally reminds me of a young/more athletic Marcus Smart."
Dude is seriously like a bouncier Marcus Smart without the out of rythm threes. Disclaimer-I think Smart is the better player but Caruso is the perfect hustle guard off the bench
I can’t stand Marcus Smart because of his flopping even though everybody flops.
"i was thinking caruso and marcus smart, both have great timming on switches and awereness"
Celtics only have Marcus smart playing defense so that’s no surprise added with a new bum coach.
a team of Davion Mitchell - Marcus Smart - Dortz - Draymond - and Bam would be fun as hell and damn near impossible to score on
"He can't even post up properly because they put some burly wings (or guards, if you have a Marcus Smart) on him and he gets shoved off his spot before he can do anything  Dude should just embrace being a rich man's Splash Mountain Brook Lopez and fire away from 3, fuck the post up just spam the pick&amp;pop with Luka Doncic."
"Marcus Smart I've got reasons but none of them are very good, it sucks too cause I always used to root for the Celtics when the bucks sucked but smart irritates me so much I can't bring myself to like them even though I really like Tatum and JB."
"Lol Dwight being lazy on D and AD called him out immediately? I don’t get the issue.  As a Celtics fan, I wish we had a player that would hold everyone accountable…someone how can also go out there, play well, and lead by example.   Marcus Smart yelling at you then bricking three 3’s  in a row isn’t as convincing."

Crowder went to the Marcus Smart school of Punkasses
Yes Marcus smart get yo bitch ass outta here
Brad Stevens chose Marcus Smart over Evan Fournier. Joke of a head coach and now joke of a GM. He has single-handedly set back the organization for years. Wasted Kyrie's prime years and wasted the deepest roster in 2018-19.
"totally, im just shitting on our offense. marcus smart is one of the best"
you should have watched our last game. everyone on the wizards became marcus smart
"First of all - nor Cam nor Hunter are ball handlers. To understand basketball is to understand how much impact special players have, without looking at the stat sheet. Marcus Smart is the best possible example, he has stats of a 2-way player but the effect on a game he makes is tremendous   Bogi starts actions that will not result in his assist, or a direct basket, to be written down on stat-sheet, but he made it several times easier for teammates to score due to his play making. Thats the thing McMillan sees and the reason why he has him in a game even if his shots dont fall in   When it comes to shots falling in - remember play-offs before his leg got busted ? He literally changed the course of several 4th quarters that tipped into Hawks favor by hitting crucial shots. Shooters gonna shoot, and Bogdan has that experience in the clutch much more before he joined even Kings.   Someone also suggested Huerter to be traded - he is Caruso Lite on the court. You do not remove that way of playing easily.   And the last would be that neither Cam nor Hunter have shown consistency that you so blatantly assign to Bogdan. There are recent games just this pre-season where both of them played like shit. As I said initially - we can talk about replacing/trading Bogi, once Hunter proves he is as much as valuable. ATM he isnt."
"it's not like some trump card though, good PFs/Centers take advantage of the lack of size. It's not like you could stick marcus smart on tim duncan and basically neautralize him"
"No shade on Hunter. He's legit. But this has always been an issue for KP and he has somehow never fixed it. He's awful in the post. Marcus Smart locks him down every time they play too. Smart is obviously a great defender too but is 6'3"" and KP has almost a foot on him."
Marcus Smart was my first thought. It’s crazy how he can be bodied in the post by guys a foot shorter than him.
I remember watching a Celtics - Mavs game last year where Marcus Smart backed him down in the post like prime Shaq. He legit was able to just bully Porzingus around down there despite being a full foot shorter
"No, because first of all that’s not even a record.   Marcus smart also isn’t arguably the second greatest shooter ever either so the point is mute"
I don’t care about single game records😂. Marcus smart hit 12 threes in a game does that make him top 75!

Thought he was Marcus Smart /s
If feel like the double OT meant that people forgot that Marcus Smart became only the 4th NBA player to achieve a Dobble BANG from Mike Breen
Jalen brown 3 before that Marcus smart one was amazing. He hit that thing from half court.   Celtics were gassed in the end. Thought it was gonna be a war of attrition until they got rose in there in 2nd ot.   Schroeder had some heart breakers though. Hope his shots start going in this season
I swear Marcus Smart is actually one of the clutchest dudes in the game. He always seems to make the timely bucket.
No way Morey is taking that we gotta throw in 3 pick swaps and Marcus Smart too
The Marcus Smart buzzer-beater   The video game threes in OT   The blown Brown dunk      The end of this game was WILD
Marcus Smart sends the game to OT with a Garnett-Pierce-Allen?!?! /sarcasm
Knicks should win this but Marcus Smart is gonna have a 5 point play somehow 🙄
Marcus Smart got a double BANG from Mike Breen? Unbelievable
Marcus Smart has achieved a double bang. This moment will live on forever.
Marcus Smart vs the Raptors level shooting
Kemba totally threw the game at the end.  2 turnovers and giving Marcus Smart space for whatever reason.
This is the most Marcus Smart game of all fucking time. He singe handedly chucked the C's into a big defeciet and then hit the biggest shot of the game to send it to OT.
"Ah yes, the Marcus Smart experience."
Marcus. Fucking. Smart.
this Marcus Smart redemption arc sucks man
No way lmao Marcus Smart of all people
Marcus Smart would make that shit
Fucking Marcus smart lmao
MARCUS SMART HSHDUDKSOD
30 min ago everyone was saying Marcus Smart wasn’t shooting enough lol
"Marcus Smart needs to learn to not shoot. As great as he is on defense, he's equally bad offensively jeezus"
WTF IS MARCUS SMART DOING HOLY SHIT LMAOO
Why is Marcus Smart and Tatum taking all the shots instead of JB
Marcus Smart looks like he has shoe laces growing out of his head.
Marcus Smart
That was primarily just loud King's fans and the king's sub is full of morons who think Buddy is the worst because he doesn't have Kyrie's handles and the defense of Marcus Smart. Basically they wanted him to be a top 10 player and hate him because he's not.
The Marcus smart experience
"If the Celtics continue treating Marcus Smart as the second coming of Larry Bird and Tatum and Brown as afterthoughts, then don't be surprised"
6’9” Marcus Smart would be DPOY but I’m fine leaving him at 6’7” to bring Robert Williams to 6’10”
"However I also wouldn’t be surprised if he told Tatum he wasn’t planning on leaving, and that’s why our FO made sure to sign extensions for Marcus Smart and Robert Williams. However he can get the most money by signing with the wizards in free agency, so if he does leave I think the earliest is next offseason in a sign and trade. After that he could always request a trade like others do"
Marcus Smart too
"Green and anyone else would learn more about the game itself from watching YouTube videos (i.e. [Marcus Smart Teaching Defense](https://youtu.be/o1Eid7669zY)) than sports networks unironically. You'd think Green of all people would already know that its an entertainment business at the end of the day. Drama, regardless of whether I like it or not, does have high engagement levels whether it'd be storylines or some controversial shit. I'm no different since I commented on this to give my 2 cents."
TELL MARCUS SMART NOT TO FORGET TO BOARD THE PLANE
Timmy GOAT Bank shot  Harden GOAT Strip Club attendee  Kyrie GOAT wokeness   Marcus Smart GOAT Flopper  Westbrook GOAT Triple Double Stat Padder
"The length and athleticism pop sometimes. He moves like a guard. He can kind of handle. Maybe if he follows Marcus smart around for a year, it could help him. He chucks, can’t shoot and really doesn’t have a high iq on either side. I get the appeal, but I just don’t see it ever working out. He’s just not good at anything."
Neither Jrue nor Matisse are better at guarding bigger players than Marcus Smart because he outweighs them both by 20 lbs without giving up any quickness.
Nah those guys are overrated. I want Marcus Smart and Manu Ginobilli.
Its honestly close  Jokic  Embiid  Clint Capela  Julius Randle  Jerami Grant  Marcus Smart  Jusef Nurkic  Zach Lavine  Could possibly make an argument for:  Dinwiddie  Bogdan  Jordan Clarkson

"Marcus Smart, well I kind of hate him but it is a very fun kind of hate that recognizes he is a damn good player"
"Plus Horford, Rozier, Smart, and Marcus Morris"
Eh  Lowkey Marcus smart is at his career average for 3s so I don’t expect that to get better Al horford def should return to the mean hopefully
Marcus Smart DPOY
"&gt; theres like 5 guards with better defensive ratings than booker who have played 300 or more minutes but none of them have similar offensive workloads except donovan mitchell  Offense isn't a consideration for all defense though, so this is the key part. Marcus Smart shot 42/36/80 and 37/34/83 in his all defense seasons, for example."
Anybody thinks Marcus Smart is elite still? He’s good but he’s far from his best years which are 2-3 seasons ago

"Ya, it's absolutely a leadership issue.  I read once that Marcus Smart wants to be the leader, but no one will defer to him because he's too much of a hothead I think.  The Jays are both pretty young still, so you wouldn't expect them to really be leaders.  In any case the problem seems to be lack of leadership reigning \*them\* in lol.  Like they really didn't want to hear from Hayward cuz he wasn't playing well and well... I guess Horford is the only other seasoned vet they've really played with?

"Ha - Marcus Smart disease.  You almost wince when he makes a tough shot early, because you know he's jacking 3 more in the next 5 possessions."
Lmao no. Post anything about Marcus Smart and prepare for the most polarizing responses possible
"POBO Brad built a defense-focused team in the most prolific offensive era in the history of the game. They basically just banked on the Jays scoring ~30 each every night and figured everyone else could throw in whatever bullshit came their way, and shut everyone down on defense to make up for it. But the Jays almost never have great games on the same night, and more importantly one of them is always out of the lineup, so we are left depending on Marcus Smart, Dennis Schroder, Al Horford and Josh Richardson to make up for it, which they can't do.   On top of that, Tatum has really bought in to his own hype, and gives the defense the absolute easiest task of just standing around and watching him Iso into a sidestep 3 as his main scoring preference. He has had a couple of games when he has made a clear effort to not do that, and he has looked unstoppable, and his rebounding and passing have both improved dramatically this year, but he just can't get past defaulting to playground ball, and the worst part is that we don't really have the roster to prove to him that he can defer sometimes to make the defense think and work a bit.   Basically, our team sucks in both roster construction and execution."

"Starting 3, it's just the Js and Marcus Smart"
Marvin Bagley was playing great defense on LeBron in those overtimes. He was getting over screens like he was Marcus Smart.
Imagine being Marcus Smart and having to talk to Jayson Tatum everyday
Marcus Smart and I guess Jayson Tatum as of now are getting shredded by Celtics fans
Jaylen and Jayson are currently combining for 2-13 from the field and 0-2 from 3.  Marcus smart also has 10 FGA.
"Marcus Smart is the default shit on player because of his bad scoring numbers but he does literally everything else at a high level.    Grant Williams also got a lot of flack until this hear, but idk wtf people were expecting from him?"
I think there are a lot of Boston fans that are ready to move on from Marcus Smart
Marcus smart is super controversial among people at my office
People in our sub love to hate on Marcus Smart. You'd think that he fucked their women or something by the way they talk about him sometimes.
Marcus Smart and it isnt even close.
Marcus Smart… I love him and think he’s on a title winning team but he’s the most over rated C by far
Marcus Smart gives his all every night. That’s why he is the GOAT.
"Marcus Smart for sure, every time the Cs lose, smart is one of the first to get the stick."
"like most things Arenas says, it's complete and utter bullshit...tell me that Marcus Smart being allowed to hand-check guards wouldn't have a huge impact on them and then I'll tell you that you are full of shit"
Lol your comment just reminded me of the Marcus Smart flop compilation videos where each play is him wiping out 2 points with his acting jobs.
"Smart has the franchise record for made threes in a game. He went 11-for-22 lol. 2 short of Klay’s league record of 24 attempts in a game.   Marcus Smart, Celtics 3 point leader."
We have quite a few:  Grant Williams  Marcus Smart  Jayson Tatum(to some extent)
"Yup, and Draymond Green is who Marcus Smart thinks he is lol."
"Playmaking is very heavy ceiling raiser and a good versatile defender raises it even more.  There’s a reason why advanced metrics indicate he has a solid case for top 10-20 player in the league right now.  Melo is currently league wide. 4th in RAPTOR  12th BPM 9th VORP 14th EPM  We’ve seen players like Draymond with no offensive skills but adds so much to overall team offense by mere playmaking. Even this year where some players like Marcus Smart or  Kyle Lowry who can’t hit a shot to save their lives are impacting so much of their team offense.  Scoring is so overrated in today’s league, especially since many of the archetype of scorers are pretty awful on the defensive end. That being said, it’s good that Ant has shown to be a pretty decent defender with his athleticism."
Solomon Hill over Marcus Smart
"Rubio has been huge for us - even with Mobley, we'd be among the worst teams without Ricky. And it's amazing to think we got him for a guy putting up 4/2/1 (and that only with rounding) on 33/24/75 splits. I doubt Boston ever explored it, but if they had traded for Rubio (even giving up Marcus Smart) they would likely be doing a lot better this year."
"Yeah, you take the good with the bad with Marcus IMO. He's generally been pretty clutch in his career, but he does make the occasional bonehead play. It's kind of annoying when he makes a couple threes in a row and you just *know* he's gonna come up the court next possession and immediately throw up a heat check (which doesn't go in 90% of the time, but when it *does* you know you're watching A Marcus Smart Game)"
"Yeah I can’t blame them for thinking he’s been trash. But to answer your question guys like Thybulle or maybe Marcus smart don’t have the best stats but are really good defensively, which is the case with Hayes"
"100% Marcus, 50% Smart"
"Yeah you can scrap together a contender if 10 ppg or less with Prime Lebron. You got the lineups already included on the thread but other players can be prime Trevor Ariza, Danny Green, Harkless, Larry Nance Jr., PJ Tucker, Marcus Smart is towing the line, Reggie Bullock and the like and scrounge up a decent core of prime 3 and d core around prime Lebron to contend. You can also look at old players that declined and had a couple bad season that dragged their career below 10ppg but they are actually better then that."
I just remember him trying to call out Marcus smart for not being part of that life when he grew up fighting gangs and stuff.

Solomon Hill over Smart  https://www.thescore.com/nba/news/1155525  There was a better replay showing Smart started falling by himself in typical Marcus Smart fashion.
Marcus Smart is screaming in the #Celtics locker room and there is a bunch of arguing going on. Smart comes out say “y’all on that bullshit!” Team is imploding. Smart is in bathroom and there is still screaming coming from locker room.
"Actually was thinking about the Marcus Smart incident back when he was in college, but that works as well"
Imagine having Marcus Smart on your team and making this comment lmao
lol Marcus Smart was flopping the whole 2nd half though
"being a relatively neutral observer is fun, because goddamn james harden &amp; marcus smart are both annoying as fuck to watch"
Marcus Smart and Romeo Langford being in the rotation is what really seals the Celtics' fate in mediocrity
"Defensive reputation is just completely unchanging and I don’t know why. People still think Marcus Smart is one of the best guard defenders in the league.   I get why reputations follow players, but a guy whose jumpshot gets a lot better or worse gets that recognition far before people notice a player improving or declining defensively."
Careful because if you say Smart has been good they’ll call you a homer haha but this is factually correct. Marcus has been way way better as of late and it seems like he’s adjusting to the point guard role. Huge late bloomer vibes from Smart.
Mark my words Marcus Smart will become our Kyle Lowry
"Absolutely true, I think what Marcus said in the heat of the moment is true and I think what JB said is completely reasonable as well   These are two smart guys who have said they like playing together and are passionate about basketball"
"I’m assuming you just googled key terms that aligned with the narrative you’re going for here and didn’t actually read anything    “I see two guys that really like each other,” Ainge said on 98.5 The Sports Hub’s “Toucher and Rich.”   “Oh, it’s definitely not 15 players, 15 cabs. I see these guys every day at practice. They get along great. And they have fun, they’re laughing, they’re hanging out,” Ainge said.  Brown said. “At the end of the day we’ve been playing basketball together for a long time – all of us, especially our core group. So when it comes down to it, it’s all about trying to find ways to win. And that’s what most of the conversation was about.”  Jaylen Brown, for one, was not angry at Smart for his postgame outburst.  “That’s why we love him,” Brown said. “He plays with passion, he’s full of fire, and that’s what I love about him most to be honest. He has that desire and that will, and we need him to continue to have that. ... Who Marcus is, I love him for it. We’ve got to get ready to come back with that same fire”"

"Ok so let’s just pretend that luka demands a trade after losing in the first round of the playoffs again, since that’s hypothetically the only way the Mavericks would listen to offers. You’d have to look for something like the Harden package but way, way better, because 1) the Harden trade sucked for the rockets and 2) Luka is only 22. So the most competitive offers would probably look like:  Boston offering Jaylen Brown, Robert Williams, Aaron Nesmith, and Marcus Smart (maybe? idk how the contracts would work) and all their picks  Pelicans offer Ingram, Alexander-Walker, Herb Jones and picks  Sixers offer Simmons, Maxey, Danny Green, Korkmaz and picks  Timberwolves send a paltry offer of Malik Beasley, D-Lo, McDaniels, Nowell and all their picks  Kings send a slightly less insulting offer of Fox, Bagley, and Davion Mitchell along with all of their picks  Maybe the Pacers get involved with Brogdon and Duarte?  Thunder could be in the mix with their millions of picks, although there’s no way Luka would demand a trade just to get sent to OKC lol.   Off the top of my head those are the only teams that could/would throw together some big trade package if Luka wants out.   Plus, when it comes to picks, you’d be looking at ~8 firsts (4 unprotected firsts, 4 pick swaps)  Obviously none of these trades match his value, but when your star player publicly demands a trade you begin to lose leverage and have to start looking for the best deal available.   Pelicans and Thunder have the best draft assets of the teams listed, Sixers and Celtics have the best talent offered. I’d be most inclined to take the either the Sixers or Pelicans deal, but I’d still try to squeeze every last asset I could get out of them."
"yes, Marcus Smart is buying into false narratives too...."
"""I heard, Jayson Tatum called Marcus Smart am ugly poopy pants.""  These gossip headlines citing unnamed sources are something else, man. Can literally just make up what they want, claim it's an opinion of someone with credibility who may have 0 access or close knowledge, if they exist at all, and pass it off as newsworthy."
I mean sure he didn’t do the best on court but off the court he really did help us (suns). We had no culture and the team was in a rut lacking that locker room presence. Kelly came in and you instantly saw a cultural change within the organisation. he started and helped build “the valley boys” I wanted to keep him as an off the bench energy guy. He always played hard and kept that high energy even when we were down. I think if he could accept that role and play into it he would benefit a lot of teams. Every team needs the energy guy and locker room leader and you can tell who it is clearly on each team. Shoutout Marcus Smart!
"&gt;CHA: Lamelo, Miles Bridges, PJ Washington &amp; a 1st  &gt;BOS: Jayson Tatum, Marcus Smart &amp; Al Horford   &gt;PHX: Booker &amp; Ayton  Those are the only teams I see with good enough assets and Luka brings his winning style of basketball to these teams."
I know he brings a lot of intangibles but I still don't get the Marcus Smart love or that contract. He's shot better than 40% from the field and 36% from three one time in his career and that's as a 4th/5th option.    I don't for the life of me understand why anyone thinks he's a great trade asset. He's a fine role player but you can find guys like him for a fraction of the price
Hello Marcus Smart
"I went to a Celtics @ Hornets game last month, and late in the game, a fan near me yelled ""Marcus Smart has a pussy! Marcus Smart has a slit between his legs!""  Everyone ignored him, which is fine, but what a gross, unfunny thing to say, especially with children around. I kind of like funny heckling. I can tolerate boo's and ""you suck"" chants. But fans like this dude are just bizarre."
I always thought about how funny and also satisfying it would be if the entire league just teamed up against Marcus Smart and started flailing their bodies up in the air and falling over onto the floor whenever they are barely touched by Smart.
"&gt; The argument would have to go both ways to argue their offensive games are equally developed.   Buddy you need to try a little harder to my comments, I never said they were equally developed. In the original comment you replied to I literally said Mitchell's offense was better.   &gt; Mitchell is going to adjust and his numbers are going to come up and be clearly beyond what Thybulle is capable of, he’s just in a tough spot to adjust to having to deal with NBA defenders. The reason he’s asked to create his own shot is because he has the ability to get more comfortable and effectively contribute in that manner, while Thybulle absolutely does not.   Cool. I'm not arguing that Mitchell has the same offensive potential as Matisse, the point of contention with the original guy who replied to me was over their offensive games today.   Maybe I wasn't clear enough with my position. I believe that there is a threshold for offensive production that teams have for players. If players fall below that threshold, you do not want to give them the ball or have them take too many shots. Both Matisse and Mitchell are far below that threshold. Mitchell is closer to it than Thybulle, but they are both clearly at the point, right now, where you don't want them taking many shots if you actually want to win games. Does Mitchell have a higher chance of knocking down a contested 3? Sure. Do I want Mitchell shooting a contested 3? Absolutely not. They are both at the level where they should probably be the last option in any given lineup.   &gt; He hasn’t shown he’s capable of more though, he has basically the least developed offensive game possible, he wouldn’t be on the floor if not for defense because there’s no point in developing it.   I don't see what the point of this is. Mitchell wouldn't be in the NBA if not for his defense either.    &gt; I’m also not sure why you got so sensitive about me bringing up sample sizes. Is that too complicated bruv?   Lol? That's a bit aggressive. I think you're getting a little too emotionally invested in this, my guy. I'll say it once again: I'm not arguing over Mitchell's career potential, only what we've seen from his game so far. He's a guy you want on the floor purely for defensive production, and he gives you almost nothing on offense. Marcus Smart gives you more than both for offense. The sample size is irrelevant."
Yeah.  Not saying Davion is a bust at all but his offense is pretty underwhelming for someone who was in college for 4 years. Duarte and Brogdon looked like vets as rookies  His size also limits him in a way. His ceiling is probably a Marcus smart or Pat Bev level player but he’s already 23.
He’s a Marcus Smart type player

"Marcus Smart!! It doesn't happen often but when Smart gets *hot* hot he can single-handedly win a game within a few minutes. Dude becomes LOCKED-IN on D, turns into Steve Nash passing, and literally doesn't miss. Only lasts like 4 minutes tops tho"
Lol idk Marcus Smart has done stuff like this before and he gets labeled a fake tough guy by pasty white guys on Reddit.
"and Okoro's is among the worst, the Marcus Smart look isn't a good one"
A great Marcus Smart sequence is like sugary cocaine made out of Unicorn bone marrow.
 [So lets suspend Marcus Smart for this](https://youtu.be/GQn6mpUqWZQ?t=50)
Kawhi’s own health would stop him. Imagine Westbrook and Marcus Smart as a DB or AI as a QB or Zion as an edge rusher.
Yeah super dangerous and unnecessary play. Imagine if Marcus Smart or a Morris Twin did that. They’d be suspended for multiple games
"Some that come to mind.  If you're a bigger scoring guard that can run PnR and shoot 3s you're Harden/Ginobili (especially if you're lefty). Examples: Jaden Hardy, DLo, Luka, Cade.  If you're a skilled off ball guard that can shoot you're Ray Allen/Klay/Beal and recently Lavine. Examples: Jalen Green, Buddy Hield, Malik Monk, Booker, Mclemore.  If you're an undersized but strong and long two guard who can't shoot well you're Wade. Examples: Jaden Ivey, Marcus Smart, Donovan Mitchell, Oladipo, Anthony Edwards.  If you're an explosive and fast PG, you're Rose. Examples: Wall, Fox, Morant. Maybe Westbrook, Baron Davis, and Steve Francis are other common comps.  If you're a PnR playmaking PG that can't shoot, you're Rondo. Examples: Schroeder, Kris Dunn, Elfrid Payton, Ntilikina."
"Draymond is consistently called dirty lmao. Just like cp3 with his mid air shove on giannis in the last finals. Or think pat bev, marcus smart, the morris bros."

Marcus smart
"Lol at that exaggeration. Go on YouTube and look up the worst flops from just recent years. Listen it’s ok if you don’t like LeBron but go watch Marcus Smart or Pat Bev if you wanna talk about flops. Hate the rules not the player. Refs shouldn’t call it if they don’t want guys to do it. I don’t get why LeBron deserves special attention for something everyone does. You better keep that same energy for like 80% of guys in the league especially the guards, Hell even the bigs like Embiid/Jokic are flailers. But you choose to focus in on LeBron like he’s the worst culprit."
Ya no we want Jaylen Brown. Kemba is trash and fits none of our needs. Marcus Smart is good but we are loaded at the 2 and sort of at the 1. This trade just doesn’t make sense and we’d absolutely need Jaylen brown to get it done.
my guy just fell backwards and looked like the starfish from finding nemo and got the call.  Marcus Smart is taking notes somewhere.
Idk Marcus Smart has had some atrocious flops
Marcus Smart. Dude will bleed and throw his body around with no hesitation to help his team
"Seriously. The trade offers the spurs received were garbage for a player of Kawhi's level. Tobias Harris and two mid firsts. Marcus Smart on a 20M/year contract and picks. Covington, Saric, and picks. Those are not trades for an MVP level player."
Can't call LeBron a flopper because then what do u even call Marcus Smart and Lowry etc  LeBron has embellished contact a few times but not really a flopper
"i can only assume that the league puts a lot of pressure on the refs to not punish certain guys for flopping.  because if you think about it, flopping makes their job a lot harder than it needs to be. take any group of people just trying to do their job, and introduce a practice that just makes their job harder for no good reason, and those people crack down on it. i would have expected the refs to target notorious floppers and refuse to call anything but the most egregious fouls against them years ago.   and the sad thing is the game would be much better if the refs had done that. if the refs made an example of LeBron and Marcus Smart, and those guys needed to be clearly hacked to get a call (and therefore light contact against them never got called), then new guys coming into the league would know that it isn't worth it.   the NBA is so close to being better to watch than it ever has been and if they could just (mostly) eliminate flopping and shooters jumping into defenders we'd be there."
"The worse might be Marcus Smart when he jumped in the air, because that could have been dangerous."
Good on him. Take advantage of the rules. That was a 5 on the Marcus Smart Scale of Flopping. A 10 would be Smart’s famous ‘Flying Fish’ flop vs the Hawks.   https://youtu.be/GQn6mpUqWZQ
Marcus Smart stepping over Trae Young😂☘️
Marcus Smart without his defensive IQ is thick Dion Waiters
“and I took that personally”-marcus smart
Don't forget Marcus Smart
Marcus Smart is elite on the perimeter but too small for bigs. Paul George is elite on the perimeter and ok against bigs. Paul George is not a better defender then Marcus Smart.
"If you don’t mean overall and just perimeter, Kawhi when he’s locked in like he has been so far this year, Marcus Smart, and Jrue are the guys who have cases. But Ben is right there with them."
"&gt; I hate how “by themself” means on offense. Do the great defensive players on that team get credit for carrying the defense the way AI carried the offense? Nope.  I mean, that's just the nature of basketball. One guy can't carry a defense the way 1 guy can carry an offense. Not one thinks Gobert is more valuable than Jokic either, or that Marcus Smart or Jrue Holiday are more valuable than Curry and Dame."
"We're out Yuta and OG, they're out Romeo Langford/Marcus Smart/Robert Williams from what I'm seeing"
Oof. That’s almost ‘Marcus Smart Flying Fish’ territory bad.
"There’s a difference between exaggerating existing contact and flopping. A flop to me is when you don’t get touched and you flail like a moron (See Smart, Marcus for exhibit A). When you exaggerate contact, you’ve been fouled but flail to get the attention of the ref. Every player in the NBA with a brain exaggerates contact."
Would I rather have a guy who has a Kevin Durant like scoring arsenal and efficiency or the guy whose peak is Marcus Smart at best?    Hmm...
"I had no idea what we were getting with him. With playing abroad, all the social media followers, the athleticism talk - I thought he would be like MPJ 2.0  But he is more like Baby Marcus Smart. Always going a million miles an hour, dives for loose balls, Coach Malone loves him. FO did good with him."
is marcus smart a star player to you?
Marcus smart temporarily turning into Steph Curry in one of those 4th quarters still pisses me off (I think it was game 2)
Bron ain’t making it as a guard lmao ain’t making it full stop imo drop him and slot Marcus Smart in at the guard spot
"This is a really great breakdown. *Rebounding* has been an issue for us, frontcourt defence really hasn't. Bringing in TT on a cheaper deal was supposed to shore up our rebounding while giving us more flexibility, and while it hasn't been *all* good I'm not unhappy with the decision.  Don't get me wrong, I'd rather have Turner... but I'd even *more* prefer some actual reliable role players at other positions. We have exactly one reliable bench guard right now, and he's a *rookie.* If we can use the TPE to get an actual starting-caliber PF who can grab boards and let us use Marcus Smart as a sixth man again, that alone would be huge."
"Lonzo isn’t as good as Marcus Smart and he’s never going to be the third best player on a contender either.    He’s not an awful player but he doesn’t fit this team s personnel nor its play style.  If they tie up the cap to re sign a middling player like Lonzo, it would preclude them from making bigger moves in 18 months.   Re signing Lonzo prevents Nola from the potential of adding a max FA in the summer of 2022.  “But no max FAs will sign in New Orleans!”  What about if that FA knew that they could not only join BI and Zion, but also whatever disgruntled star the Pelicans could pick up with the Adams or Bledsoe expirings and the armful of firsts Nola has in the coming decade"
One could say they are not   Marcus Smart  Cue mass booing
uhh no? if you know marcus smart is a notorious flopper you need to be extra critical and not blow the whistle if they just end up on the floor
"Our media shits on the the ""Green Teamers"" and Celtics more than r/nba does. Listen to Felger and Mazz discuss Marcus Smart and you'll lose brain cells and realize how wrong you are at the same time"
I thought it was gonna be a picture of Marcus Smart. Like I enjoy watching his flops but I imagine I would be annoyed if he did that against Warriors and got the call lol
"Marcus Smart Kyle Lowry, is that you?"
"Kemba costs $6-10M less per year than John Wall and is a better shooter.  Wall is most effective with the ball in his hands, at this point I want the ball with the Jays as much as possible.  Kemba has been bad so far this year but he's coming back off an injury, I am withholding judgement and panic until he's had more time and until Marcus Smart is back.     As soon as Smart comes back, the double big lineup of TT &amp; Theis can go away and it'll be easier for the Celtics to have more playmakers on the floor all the time.  I am still concerned about Kemba's size &amp; issues driving to the rim when it matters, but a 27 PPG Jaylen Brown &amp; Jayson Tatum mean that Kemba won't need to do as much in the playoffs."
"It's really hard to say what his trade value is, all I know is that I haven't forgotten that Ainge was literally obsessed with him to the point that he offered 4 FRPs for him at the time of the draft.   Ainge has said that we're after ""shooting with size"" with that huge ass TPE, so Justise doesn't quite fit the bill there, but I'd arguably that we could use a wing version of Marcus Smart, a playmaker on offense, and an incredibly versatile defender. I'm kinda done with Kemba on the Celtics, love the man, he's a great dude, but he's not really the right fit for us anymore."
Here are all the guys people will want to mention ranked in my opinion. Lot of these guys are really close to one another. Especially in the range of Holiday to Murray.  1. Stephen Curry 2. James Harden 3. Damian Lillard 4. Kyrie Irving 5. Bradley Beal 6. Chris Paul 7. Trae Young 8. Demar Derozan 9. Kyle Lowry 10. Donovan Mitchell 11. Devin Booker 12. CJ McCollum 13. Jrue Holiday 14. De'Aaron Fox 15. Ja Morant 16. Zach Lavine 17. Mike Conley 18. Jamal Murray 19. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 20. Fred Van Vleet 21. Malcolm Brogdon 22. Kemba Walker 23. Russell Westbrook 24. Collin Sexton 25. Marcus Smart
That's kinda what we do with Royce O'Neal. It seems effective most nights.  I mean if only the Celts had a stopper like Marcus Smart. . .
Stop.  Marcus Smart would lock his old ass up
Wonder how this game would turn out if Marcus Smart was guarding Mitchell.  Same can be said if Conley wasn’t hurt
Your team has Marcus smart pipe down
"They randomly bring the flopping fines back for some reason. Marcus Smart got a flopping fine on 9/20/2020, one for Pat Bev in 2019, but I don't think there were any others at all in those seasons"
"I asked what progression he's made to instill confidence as a core piece. I still don't see that progression as his half court limitations that existed previously still do now.   Murray shot 46% from mid range last year and is shooting 45% now. Improvement? The reason this number still doesn't make him a dynamic scorer is because these attempts are often open (by design) and not a shot that he hunts aggressively enough to make a defense commit more attention to him.  Murray shot 36% from three last year and is shooting 32% now. The increased volume is a justifiable reason for the decline in percentage. But it is still not inspiring considering that these shots are largely assisted and the percentage is well below league average.   Murray still never gets to the FT line, another problem with his scoring.  Murray is great for his position, but like all guards except perhaps Marcus Smart he is limited in how much he can impact a defense. You saw Curry last night do pretty much whatever he wanted when looking to score. Hard to stop that unless you send aggressive help, less about the individual defender as it is a team collectively trying to bother him. In that way Murray is rather replaceable.  Murray is an expendable piece. Simply not good enough to be a core and at age 24, not likely he's going to blow up out of nowhere."
"Marcus Smart is your best offensive player here, and that's tough. I think you might have to start Bobi, and just run offense through him— at the very least, it'd be fun to watch, which I don't think you can say about any other lineup."
You struggled to close out games? Lmao. That was us. There were at least 2 games that series where we were up by a lot end of 3rd and Marcus Smart 3s saved you
Marcus Smart would salute that respectfully.
"Ok, so my starting lineup is Marcus Smart, Andre Roberson, Jared Dudley, Draymond Green and Boban Marjanovic. My Bench is KC Jones, Dennis Rodman (at SF), and Ben Wallace / Noah as the bigs.  Boban is going to be involved in every minute of the game, probably getting a dunk on nearly every possession. The rest of the team bust their ass playing 4-on-5 defense while he jogs back and just camps under the rim."
"We talk about the war chest of assets like he didn’t do anything with it but that’s blatantly false. With that war chest he drafted 3 cornerstones in Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Marcus Smart. One high end rotation player in Payton Pritchard. Two high potential young guys in Nesmith and Langford. 3 solid 20 min a night guys in Timelord, Ojeleye, and Williams. To go with that he also traded some of the chest for Kyrie which sadly didn’t go well."
"The Minnesota Timberwolves have traded Karl Anthony Towns and DLo for Kemba Walker, Tristan Thompson, Marcus Smart and 3 first round draft picks."
Never forget when Marcus Smart threw up 22 threes in a game as well
"Yeah I mean I think people think I am shit-talking KG more than I actually am here. Siakam is lightning-quick with a 7'3"" wingspan and Millsap has been a perennial plus-minus darling due to his defensive awareness and motor. I guess the main thing I am underselling here is KG's motor, so, like, throw Marcus Smart in there too.  All I'm trying to say is that as a shot-blocker and roll-man, he wasn't even quite on the level of somebody like lob-city DeAndre Jordan or Anthony Davis (look at the numbers on block rates for example). This isn't just coming from numbers for me, think back to '02-'03 when the Wolves lost to the Lakers in the first round - KG had a great series but he was not really able to bully Robert Horry the way Duncan was in the next round (this series is burned in my brain because I hated those god damn Lakers).  So in the modern NBA his game wouldn't look all that much like AD or Bam, he really would be more of a power forward. You wouldn't want to use him much as the screen-setter in PnR and you would want someone else out there to bang with bully-ball centers (tangentially, imagine time-travel KG paired with KAT or Jokic).  I can see why there are AD comparisons because AD is the only guy impacting defense from the 4 like KG did but I think it's pretty different because AD is a better shot-blocker (who probably should be playing 5) and KG, especially early-career, was an _even better_ perimeter defender than AD is now. On offense, AD is a better roll man than KG was, but also I think often tries to play like KG used to and doesn't do it quite as well. That's why I reached for Siakam and Millsap, because I feel like those two are the power forwards who are closest to replicating KG's physical tools (Siakam) and defensive IQ (Millsap), but obviously combining the two and adding that Marcus Smart-esque fire yields an all-time level PF."
"I saw Dudley, roster filler and assumed that was the logical order.   Marcus Smart, Bruce Bowen, Draymond, Joakim in their primes and trade for some shooters.  Thats a contending playoff team.   I’d want to keep Rodman, Allen and probably KC jones as well.   Keep the highest iq players, at least they can pass on offense.    Jared Dudley is being traded for a case of beer.  There is enough toughness and teamwork already without needing a fugazi."
"If I was a coach, I would not take that job. Your two options would be to put Marcus smart in and have him take every shot or have him on the bench and get a shot clock violation every time. I'd have a aneurysm by like the 3rd game of the season"
"To be fair, that's because Marcus Smart is a bitch ass flopper and every single team would love to have a player like him on their team."
KP cant post up lol. I remember when he couldn't back down marcus smart last year. It got bad.
All of the comments would have been saying to start Draymond and I wanted to pair Rodman and Wallace together.  I chose Dunn over Marcus Smart for the same reason
That’s partially because Marcus smart hits every shot against the Sixers
Lmao we hate but we recognize talent. Call Marcus Smart a bitch ass flopper every game but we’d love him on our team lol
Marcus Smart?
"Mike Conley, Serge Ibaka, Harrison Barnes, Fred Van Vleet and Marcus Smart"
"That Marcus smart is a shot chucker. He is sometimes, but people act like he is the sole reason we lose games"
This ladys was nothing. The fans who said racial slurs to like marcus smart before or those jazz fans was way worse lol.
"Ugly game from both teams honestly, Suns looked tired. Book this week has been hounded by Jrue Holiday, Matisse Thybulle and then Marcus Smart. Thankfully he’ll get a rest when playing Brooklyn since they have no one who can guard him lol"
bruh Marcus smart really made his case for dpoy this game oh my god
Me too! 11 threes for Marcus Smart had me like wtf
Marcus Smart
Marcus Smart
"To expand on #3, KP isn't really a good post up player, so this option is like a last resort. His high center of gravity makes it so smaller guys (see Marcus Smart) can push him off his spots. Phil Jackson was worried about this during KP's time on the Knicks. Posting up isn't as vital a skill for big men as it used to be, but it's still pretty useful to have in your bag. Not being a good post player limits KP to some extent."
"¨Are you putting Payton on Kawhi(230), Lebron(260), Butler(230)?¨ No because they all small forwards . Would you put Anthony Davis and Jokic on Zach Lavine or Marcus Smart? No. Kawhi and PG are bigger and longer but I didnt say he was going to be similar to them I said he would be in their category in defense impact  and ability. Although Kawhi and Gary actually do defend in the same sort of way/style IMO."
"What? Gary Payton is always brought up in discussions of the best defensive players ever. Ask some of these nba players now and former players who played against him and ask if he would be a good defender nowadays. IMO Gary would be Kawhi level of defense in 2021 for a guard size. Look at Jrue Holiday,Cp3, Mike Conley, Marcus Smart and Eric Bledsoe to name a few"
"You discounted the Sixers for them being unhealthy but they put Thybulle on Curry plenty? Plus Seth always plays like it’s a playoff game against him.  And you’re really talking about Kemba like he was Curry’s primary defender lol, try Marcus Smart?  He’s absolutely the most valuable player this year. The problem is simply his teams record makes him unlikely to win the actual award."
"&gt;passes a much different eye test than Kyrie did  And that's a very valid point and kind of what I was trying to show.    Defensive stats in general are very goofy. Brad Stevens: *""When I get an e-mail that has defensive metrics in it, I delete it.""*   Advanced stats like DRTG really don't show much of anything besides the team is good.   Raw stats like steals/blocks/rebounds don't show enough of the picture to actually declare a player is even good defensively.  * Steph Curry has led the league in steals  * Hassan Whiteside had led the league in blocks  * Andre Drummond has led the league in rebounds  I'm not saying Matisse is bad (he's obviously a very good defender), but DPOY is such a high bar to clear. Jrue Holiday, Marcus Smart and Chris Paul have never even cracked top 5 in votes. As an undersized defender with limited team-wide impact, Matisse has no real chance at DPOY.  Plus DPOY is a term we see thrown about by Philly fans.   * Embiid is a DPOY candidate (although he actually is) * Covington was a DPOY candidate * Simmons is a DPOY candidate * Thybulle will be a DPOY candidate  You can't just label everyone a DPOY candidate."
Celtics w/ Marcus Smart
jayson tatum isoing is always nice to watch. obligatory demonstration by [marcus smart](https://youtu.be/GLmNumujCyc)
And that fan grew up to become Marcus smart
Marcus Smart! That guy is the heart of that Celtic's team.
"Derrick is not a shit shooter, he's a Marcus Smart type of guy that you can't leave open from 3 and can get hot. He's clearly the best 3 pt shooter in the starting lineup."
He’s like Marcus Smart without the offense
"NBA players cover him from the 3 point line, which is probably good enough for most people.  That being said I’m pretty sure Marcus smart shoots like 15% from 3 and he gets doubled at the 3 point line so who really knows at this point."
"The thing is that people have such wildly different reactions to it. On the Celtics, Marcus Smart was asymptomatic and said he found it easy getting back into game shape when he came back. Jayson Tatum got it and still has to use an inhaler.   I can’t find anything about how MPJ was affected but I know Seth was one of the ones really badly affected. That doesn’t mean MPJ isn’t just not talking about it, but if he didn’t have as severe symptoms, it probably wouldn’t impact their games to the same extent."
It's not about heliocentrism. Kyrie can get his own bucket for sure but is a sub par playmaker. KD when he gets his own bucket his efficiency craters. Going from one of the most efficient scorer in nba history to just good levels like 58% TS compared to 62-65%.  The whole reason the clippers failed is because they don't have true pg who can get buckets for others. They recognised that which is why they traded lou will for rondo. Tor in 2019 had Kyle Lowry who is an elite playmaker that year especially (wasn't he 3rd in assists that year). Milwaukee absolutely run a heliocentric system in years past. They have reduced it this season but they have struggled to capitalise on the pressure that Giannis causes defence because no one finds those holes (and to a certain extent when they did they shot like 20% from 3). Boston have been pretty ass this year and their recent winning run has coincided with Kemba walker taking a back seat on his scoring and focusing on facilitating and getting Marcus smart their best playmaker back.  Lack of playmaking is almost always the downfall of teams. And without Harden they have a dearth of it. Maybe dinwiddie coming back will fix thatb(if he is actually fit). That plus I don't trust KD and Kyrie in terms of health and sacrificing for the team in the post season then if the meet someone decent in the 2nd round it will be very tough for them.
"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2914179-celtics-marcus-smart-recalls-racist-experience-with-fan-outside-of-td-garden  I’m not a Celtics fan, so you’ll have to correct me if I’m wrong, but Smart came after KG’s tenure, yes?"
Marcus Smart half court heave against the Pelicans a few weeks ago
You think no one has ever called Marcus smart on it? I support Raptors. Doesn't mean I don't know that Kyle Lowry is a flopper. I am not saying he is not as good as his numbers make him seem. I am saying his detractors think that. I think Harden is a top 5 player in the league. But I also think he looks for contact on purpose and I don't like that.
Marcus Smart flops. Harden draws contact. Most stars do the same.   Are you trying to say he’s not as good as his numbers make him seem? Cause that is just one of the most brain dead takes I’ve ever read here.
"&gt;A semi-decent team missing Kemba Walker, Marcus Smart, Evan Fournier, Timelord  That’s 4 of our top 6 players."
What's Marcus Smart in Italian?
Marcus Smart is the better flopper
"That point about him being worse offensively than Marcus Smart is just untrue. In smart’s first season he averaged 7.8 points on 49% TS. His second season was even worse with 9 points on 46% TS. It took him over 4 seasons to shoot over 37% from the floor. His OBPM wasn’t quite that bad but it wasn’t good. Our bench has been kinda bad this year and it ain’t really on Matisse, that’s why it’s so bad for him."
“Celtics have downgraded Marcus Smart to Marcus Dumb...”
"I would put Marcus Smart, Rudy Gobert, Paul George, and maybe Kawhi on that list as well. Tough to say in which order."
Marcus Smart is good
So Marcus Smart if he was a center
"What I mean is my team has 5 rotation players that play as primary ball handlers, and Marcus Smart is not as good of a fit in that sense."
"Thybulle has one of the best DBPM in the league at 4.2. Elite defender. Unfortunately, he is averaging 4/2/1 on TS of 51%, for a OBPM of -2.8 - one of the worst offensive players in the league. For reference, this is much worse than another defensive specialist, Marcus Smart, when he came into the league.   He's also relatively old for being a sophomore, so while he maybe a not terrible offensive player in the future, his ceiling if he doesnt improve is a decent role player."
Marcus Smart
I prefer Dort's potential and scoring ability over Marcus' better playmaking. But comparing Smart to Beverly really undersells what he brings to the team
Marcus Smart is what Pat Bev THINKS he is.
"I never said he was good in the post, this entire time I’ve been saying he could play in the post if he put forth the effort. To me him “backing down” marcus smart looked as if he wasn’t trying. If he put some effort into that shit maybe bodies in the paint would budge.  And comparing pictures to me the weight difference isn’t as obvious, it appears Kareem has bigger forearms and biceps but Kristaps definitely has a bigger chest/torso  https://s22928.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/kareem-abdul-jabbar.jpg  https://dailyknicks.com/wp-content/uploads/getty-images/2020/04/1204708666.jpeg"
"You missed the point of the video. Watch when Porzingis tries to back down Marcus Smart in the post. If you watch Porzingis play you’d realize that wasn’t a cherry picked lowlight, that’s what happens when he tries to back down most players in the post.    Like I said before, listed weights mean nothing. NBA measurements are known to be wildly inaccurate (they’ve cracked down on heights recently but not weights). You can tell a players weight more accurately by looking at them than by checking their listed weights. Players have lots of incentives to lie about their measurements.    Porzingis and Kareem both have slender body types, but Kareem was very clearly the heavier and stronger player, especially Lakers Kareem who was a more effective inside player because of his added weight and strength. It’s obvious in photos."
"Marcus Smart had one like that. November 26th 2017 against the Warriors. 31 minutes, 0-7 from the field with 1 point. What the box score doesn't show is that Smart got an offensive goaltending call which meant that a Kyrie layup didn't count.  So Smart played 31 minutes and scored -1 points. He also had 7 rebounds, 3 assists and three turnovers."
"Ok that’s fair. I wouldn’t disagree that you guys have been playing well. And you know the most about your team just like we do about ours. But you’re asserting things about our team that don’t match up with what I’ve seen in the team or in the stats.   You’re talking about how we have no match for Capela but we allow the sixth least points in the paint and since the all star break it’s been the second least. Similarly, we’ve had the 3rd best offensive rebounding rate in the league though i’ll admit were not as good with defensive rebounding. Similar thing about you guys being able to slow down the Jays. I didn’t say Marcus Smart would be able to slow down Trae despite him defending him well in the past.   It just feels like you’re making assumptions about our team. But either way, we’re both doing well right now and no real way to know what’ll happen if we match up."
that's fine...he can just pass it to marcus fuckin smart who shot 1-18 all game but decides to hit a clutch 3 to win it
"No argument? I just gave you my reasons.   I will gladly welcome a #24 ranked defense in the first round. Brad Stevens will be looking at McMillan like BBQ chicken before the series even starts.   For reference, the Celtics are top 15 in defense since their recent play. They were around #22 before I believe, still better than Atlanta. Those guys are not going to lock the Jays down in the playoffs.   That’s your delusion. Do I think Marcus Smart is going to slow Trae Young down? No I don’t, because Trae is that good. It’s irrelevant though."
"I will stay we were in a worse shape, both teams were shorthanded as you say, but we f'in started Javonte Green who's not even an NBA player. I still really like Marcus Smart on Trae Young much more than Hunter on whoever he's guarding"
"Counter: the Hawks wins this year were vs no Walker and no Smart. Our guard play has been much better since February. On top of that, we can 100% guard the other 4 Hawks. Marcus and Trae are gonna be basically dating for the entirety of a Celtics-Hawks series."
Marcus Smart - 1 dive per game
"Yeah, health is going to be important both ways. We didnt have Kemba in either of the two earlier losses this season and haven’t had Marcus Smart play any of the 3 games we’ve played"
Nerlens “Jarrett ‘Marcus Smart’ Allen” Noel
Sabonis own goaling a free throw in the clutch has to be first team all-shaqtin this season. It's up there with Marcus Smart throwing out of bounds the .3 pelican's shot clock ball
https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/big12/2013/01/22/mens-college-basketball-oklahoma-state-marcus-smart-profile/1850729/  this article might change ur mind :)
"Marcus Fucking Smart. I would love him on my team, but I hate him as an opponent."
Marcus Smart
He should've played over baze last night to finish the game. Definitely wouldn't have let Marcus smart get wide open fuckin 3s 🤦‍♂️
I want Marcus Smart to retire in green.
Marcus Smart
I’m a Lakers fan and I love Marcus Smart.
Cuz Marcus Smart didn't bait the fake handle
"Steph is a terrible example for young people. Young players see this and think they should be trying it, and they can’t and shouldn’t. Marcus Smart is VERY impressionable, and WILL try this in the next game."
Marcus Smart.
Marcus Smart no fucking way
I have no idea how Celtics fans can hate Marcus Smart but some of them do

Why did the Celtics always play iso if they were capable of more team-oriented basketball? Also Marcus Smart needs to be a little less trigger happy from the three-point line. Otherwise what a great game. Tatum vs Curry was a blast to watch.
"Yeah from my perspective getting Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, Romeo Langford, Kyrie Irving because of a trade was a terrible idea"
"Another fun stat, number of games with 20 or more 3PA  &amp;#x200B;  ||| |:-|:-| |James Harden|7| |Stephen Curry|2| |Klay Thompson|1| |Marcus Smart|1| |J.R.

"&gt; Two superstars went head to head pretty much equally and it just came down to which secondary guys delivered down the stretch.  Curry narrowly outmatched Tatum, and Kemba narrowly outmatched Wiggins. I think it came down to the rest of the supporting cast. The biggest difference came down to Marcus Smart vs Kent ""Not Smart"" Bazemore, and Jabari Parker being a pleasant surprise for y'all. Didn't think a Jabari vs. Wiggs duel would take place in this manner."
"As I was watching his interview and Brown’s after the Lakers game, I was like “damn it’s a good thing this team has Marcus Smart” This is the chillest, most reserved couple of stars and then you’ve got Marcus screaming and hyping everybody up haha"
"I think Kemba and Tatum combined for the same as Curry and Wiggins, and Tatum dueled it out almost evenly with Curry. The deciding factor was clutch time Marcus Smart and boneheaded Kent Foulmore."
Marcus Smart is a different player during crunch time. He'd either hit a game changing shot or do a winning play. This is both.
Marcus Smart hitting 2 3’s in the Clutch after missing like 10 also helped.
Like both ankles on a Marcus Smart pass-fake
Manz really got faked out by Marcus Smart lmao
"My outlook on it is that foul-BAITING is fine if you goad the defender into actually fouling you, which Curry clearly did here. The point being, ""Intentionally draw a foul."" The part I hate is when someone tries to get fouled and then acts like they just got shot when they weren't even touched. The point there being, ""Fool the ref into believing a foul has occurred."" I have way less tolerance for the second one.  (And yes I understand that I cheer for a team that employs Marcus Smart. Whatever it takes to win - I don't have to like it.)"
Marcus Smart. That is all
That defense on the marcus smart 3 where he was left open for 5 years was a bruh moment.
I’m not sure there’s a player in the league who more embodies the idea that their percentages are ass but they seem to make the shot when it matters more than Marcus Smart
Marcus Smart swishing a 3 is certainly a thing
Marcus Smart has never seen a shot he didn’t like lmao
Why does Marcus Smart have such a green light
Dude you'd be surprised. I'm not a Celtics fan despite my flair lol but the Celtics fans I know are big on impact over talent. Meaning they'd rather keep Marcus Smart and Kemba over Russ because of team chemistry and they've made the conference finals 3 out of 4 seasons.
"Marcus Smart has shot 8 3s, has he really developed into a sniper or does he just like jacking up 3s"
Marcus Smart is like shooters shoot lol
Having Marcus Smart trade threes with Steph is definitely one way to lose your lead
"PG - Ricky Rubio  SG - Marcus Smart  SF - Doug McDermott   PF - Thaddeus Young  C - Enes Kanter    There's no one on the team that can take over and be the main scorer on a night-to-night basis, neither Rubio or Smart are so deadly or consistent from 3 that I think opposing teams would be content with letting them both shoot the amount it'd take for them to create positive offense, McDermott and Young are both role players that'll give you 10-15ish points a game, and Kanter even if he has a god game like he did recently, could still be abused defensively."
"The Lakers are being overly cautious with the injuries, Marcus smart had the same injury as AD and Lebron will be fine it’s an ankle sprain that he’s already rested more than enough to recover from, if it was the nfl Lebron would be playing this week"
The Marcus cousins: Marcus Morris and Marcus Smart.
"off the top: DA then Marcus Smart, Anunoby and Aaron Gordon"
We don’t really have filler though. Like it would have to be Kemba or Marcus Smart and I wouldn’t do either of those right now especially since Porzingis wouldn’t work very well in our best lineups
"That 2014 draft has been quite the roller coaster.  A lot of hype early on, and then injuries and bad situations kind of tamped down expectations. But, now, a lot of those players have carved out really solid careers.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_2014.html  Embiid, Julius Randle, Zach Lavine, Marcus Smart, and Aaron Gordon are the top 5 players from that lottery, and the 2nd round had Jokic, Jerami Grant, &amp; Spencer Dinwiddie...  So, potentially, the top 2 MVP candidates, and 4 all stars total from that draft this season. Pretty impressive. Just not who we expected them to be coming out...  Just goes to show you have to wait several years before truly judging a draft. But, we’ll still judge anyway... 😒"
Bro you have Marcus Smart. The two of them together? Thats the mosted hated combo in the NBA
Hate from other fanbases: Marcus Smart  Hate from the Celtics fanbase: Kemba Walker
...nah I totally understand why y'all hate Marcus Smart

dude creates a lot of good Celtics content  he has one on Marcus Smart that's worth a look too  Thank you u/Wayne_Spooky
Marcus Smart.  If he was on your team instead of the Celtics you'd love him
I am 100% on board for this as I am a believer that Michael Jordan and Lebron James are 2A and 2B when it comes to the GOAT conversation - because the true #1 is Marcus Smart.
I feel like Marcus Smart is more of a guy that is hated by every fanbase and loved by every fanbase depending on who you ask.
I mean Marcus smart claimed to be the king of Toronto so I’d assume most of the fan base dislikes him. I feel like he’s generally liked for his hustle tho
""" Like, who’s doing that? "" I mean Marcus Smart and Jrue literally guard 1 through 4 almost every night. Simmons has been on one recently."
They’re consistent about it at least. Guard rankings is going to be a bunch of glass cannons with Lou Will 10 spots higher than Marcus Smart.
Kyrie and Marcus Smart would make a really fun two way player.
"Picks 1-5: Jokic, Embiid, Zach Lavine, Julius Randle, Marcus Smart"
"This team is not worth investing in. There is no trade available at the deadline that puts us in the same tier as Philly/Milwaukee/Brooklyn. JJ Redick? Harrison Barnes? Porzingis? None of them, even in the impossible scenario that we have the assets to make the trade, do not put us into the conversation of actually winning the East this year.  Our bench is garbage. Tatum and Brown are all stars but haven't figured out that thing where they make the TEAM better yet (only the Knicks and Wolves average fewer APG than the Celtics), Kemba is crawling around in the dark trying to find his shot again, and r/bostonceltics thinks Marcus Smart and Romeo Langford (who is a ghost) are going to fix what's going on right now. It's a mess. I'd much rather wait and use the massive TPE to blow this roster up in the off season than invest in this team."
"Ainge drafted 2 young two-way all-star wing players, both of whom I could easily see making All-NBA, All-defense etc teams in the future. He signed two players that were all-stars when they were signed and suffered a series of freak injuries. He hired a young coach who is widely known as one of the best in the league. Not to mention drafting an elite role player like Marcus Smart.   He’s done a lot of really good things. Obviously he’s made some blunders but when your best players are 23 and 24 and you made the conference finals last year, that’s a good place to be in. Colin Cowherd is just a loudmouth reactionary who doesn’t even watch the games he comments on.   I’m a raps fan too so I have no reason to stan the Celtics like that  Edit: I FORGOT ABOUT KYRIE BEING A CELTIC WOW feels like a decade ago... even though that ultimately didn’t work out, you do that 100% of the time. Chemistry problems with a strong personality is just bad luck"
"Marcus Smart is a huge piece for that whole team. He's their engine. Losing him is a huge blow, and while it won't fix all of their issues like having a bench of G leaguers, it will at least bring them back to being a great team"
"Who said in the next 2 years? In the next 2 years isn’t impossible though. We have a better duo than the Sixers, they just have better role players. When we had Marcus Smart, Jayson Tatum, and Jaylen Brown playing we started off the season 8-3. Marcus Smart is the most important player to this team winning. No Marcus Smart, no winning."
"I feel like I've been seeing this question/post type every other day. Bottom line is they aren't that good and are way too top heavy. No consistent bigs. No Marcus Smart, Kemba doesn't fit their roster at all. Let Terry walk. Didn't get any assets for Kyrie. Didn't move up in the draft. Stevens is proving to be an average coach. They're just not good right now I don't get why it's so complicated."
Their best playmaker Is marcus smart which isn't good considering he is marcus smart
"Marcus Smart being out is a huge issue. Also, Kemba's season has been underwhelming, although he'd been on a decent surge lately."
"1. We were on pace to be one of the best teams before Marcus went down, top 3 seed.  2. Names aren’t everything when those names have sucked this year (obviously not talking about Smart)"
"But that’s my point. On paper the Celtics still look better than the Spurs to me, yet the Spurs have a better record and gets 0 all-stars. Tatum and Brown have Kemba Walker and Marcus Smart."
Feel like shit just want Marcus Smart back
"Even if you call him a forward, Marcus Smart is also a PG. But seriously Fred on a double is lethal, man has elite hand-eye coordination and can always get a hand in without fouling. He's the ultimate Embiid help defense"
Damn Marcus smart looks like Smino
The Marcus Smart Experience.
I was going to commit to Marcus Smart but even though it's a 1 in a million chance I don't want to commit to that
And it has to be a Marcus Smart jersey
The Marcus Smart special.
I can’t judge the Celtics until Marcus smart is back
They are very bad outside of those 2 players. Their record is also awful without marcus smart this year.
"Because you have Ayton, Bridges, Saric, Crowder etc surrounding your 2 All Stars while we have a washed Kemba Walker, 15 games of Marcus Smart, and complete trash."
If course you’re right. The lack of education about the league on this sub is staggering. I’ve read hundreds of comments without one even mentioning the Marcus Smart injury. He is literally the engine &amp; heart and soul of our team - always has been. The minute he comes back I guarantee you they start cooking again and then the narrative is completely flipped on it’s head. Shits exhausting.
"oh boy, another Celtic denier....Nesmith - zero contribution thus far - Pritchard - seems like a capable NBA backup PG, Bane - could have helped them a ton this year, but they traded him - langford - garbage, Thybulle - again, could have helped them, but traded for Carson Edwards - who has contributed nothing  Grant Williams - has played out of necessity, but is a very average bench player, Rob Williams - could be useful, not sure why he doesn't play more - Yabusele - zero NBA contributions - Zicic - same - RJ Hunter - same.  Ojeleye - good 2nd round pick.  James Young, 17th overall pick from the Marcus Smart draft - zero NBA contributions.  Happy now?  Yes, he drafted Tatum and Brown, and Rozier and Smart were good picks as well.  Would you rather have Thybulle and Bane, or Edwards and whatever they got for Bane?  Langford hasn't shown anything."
Jaylen Brown **and** Marcus Smart **and** FRP’s
Huh? Danny didn’t trade for Harden because he didn’t want to give up Marcus Smart and Jaylen Brown. Great revisionist history though.
"Tony Allen, Al Jefferson, PP, Avery Bradley, Gerald Green, Delonte West, Marcus Smart"
On ball  OG Dort Marcus Smart Aaron Gordon Jrue Holiday  Off Ball  Giannis Davis Gobert Embiid Jonathon Isaac
Dude regularly gets bodied by Marcus Smart in the post he needs to stay as far away from there as possible until he decides to bulk up.
"IMO foul baiting is different than flopping, although they're both bad. KD foul baits but doesn't flop. Marcus Smart flops."
"Can't say the same, that Marcus Smart block broke my heart, and we probably should have called timeout on the last play, but overall I'm proud our guys made that series as competitive as it was."
"Who could they have gotten? Gasol went for Valancuinas, Wright, and Miles, which I don’t think the Cs could have matched value wise.  And all these deals need money matching, which means Marcus Smart, and I’ll honestly take Marcus over a ton of those guys.  I’m 1000% a stan of that beautiful flopping monster, though."
"Robert Covington is the best example, he's so so so good as an help defender for a forward, but on ball he's almost powerless wether it's against guards or power wings.  On the other end of the spectrum guys like OG Anonoby or Lou Dort are absolute lockdown on ball, but not that special as help defenders.  &amp;#x200B;  If I had to do top 5 I'd say on ball (perimeter players only):  1. OG Anunoby 2. Ben Simmons 3. Lou Dort 4. Marcus Smart 5. Kawhi  Off Ball/help defender  1. Smart 2. Simmons 3. Tatum 4. Covington 5. Mikal Bridges  Lebron can be the best off ball defender when he's into it, I won't lie I haven't really watched him enough this season to say how he's been, also possible that Kawhi has slept and I just didn't notice, kudos to Royce O'Neal (on ball), Dejounte Murray (on and off the ball), Thybulle (off ball, didn't include him in the top 5 because he doens't play enough for me, but could be THE best), Jrue (on ball), Kyle Anderson (off ball), Jae'Sean Tate (on ball), Wiggins (on ball).  &amp;#x200B;  I'm sure that I forgot a big name"
"what would you think about a robert williams/marcus smart/a first for him? too low, okay, or too much?"
Covid &amp; Missing Marcus Smart.  Mavs/Heat also have covid in common too and it hurt their seasons. The basketball media kind of just pretends it isn't affecting teams... while it very much is.
Ben Simmons  Jrue Holiday   Marcus Smart  Khris Dunn
I mean... they're also missing Marcus Smart? And missed a bunch of games from Tatum due to COVID...  Celtics are gonna be fine lol.
"Yeah I see the baggage as mainly the Kemba contract, the cap situation (though in fairness some of that is allocated to the guys who are the other team's future), and the lack of assets to create flexibility.  As for draft capital, to me it's a matter of having made too many selections and seeing too many of those selections ultimately return 0 value. Like let's go all the way back to 2013 and the draft day when the Brooklyn trade happened.  In 2013, the C's pick Kelly Olynyk. He walks away for nothing in 2017.  In 2014, they pick Marcus Smart (indisputably a big fat W), but they also pick James Young, who flames out of the league almost immediately.  In 2015, they grab Rozier. Turns out he's a great pick, but ultimately he's dumped to get Kemba Walker, who has produced mixed results so far and will likely either leave in free agency or cost picks to move. He's followed up by RJ Hunter (out of the league), Jordan Mickey (out of the league), and Marcus Thornton (out of the league).  In 2016, the Brooklyn trade pays off in a big way and they take Jaylen Brown. Unfortunately, they hang onto the #16 and #23 pick# too long and they becomes cap casualties in the form of Yabu and Zizic as necessary draft-and-stashes who never develop into an NBA players. He does manage to turn two seconds into a Memphis 1st (from the Clippers). But that becomes the Thybulle selection in 2019 and turned into #24 (Ty Jerome) and #33 (Carsen Edwards). Jerome returned the #30 pick in 2020, which has since been turned back into two seconds. Edwards got a guaranteed deal for no real reason and likely will be out of the league soon.  The C's then still take 3 second round picks in this draft, two of whom drop out of the league (Demetrius Jackson, Ben Bentil). The other was Abdel Nader, who ultimately was dumped for Rodney Purvis, who was promptly waived.  2017 is another strong start with the Tatum selection. At 37, they also get Semi, who has over-performed for being drafted that late. But will he be here long-term? Or end up as another selection who walks away for nothing? Still not sure he belongs in a real contender's rotation. We also end up taking two more guys in the second round (Kadeem Allen and Jabari Bird) who do not play NBA basketball anymore.  In 2018, the last Brooklyn pick gets shipped out for Kyrie, who will leave for nothing. I don't blame Ainge for this one as I don't think many people understood what a headcase Kyrie actually was. They also get Robert Williams in this draft, which looks great so far.  I'm going to set aside the 2019 and 2020 drafts because they are too recent. But I will say the Edwards and Waters picks are really baffling and seemed destined to fail pretty early on. Why is the team so focused on getting undersized guards?  Anyway, the team has made so many draft selections, but aside from the three home runs and Kemba, they've turned into what 2 other guys that fans can feel confident may be rotation players (Robert and Pritchard)? We've got our fingers crossed that Langford and Nesmith will join them, but who knows. Maybe Semi and Grant can contribute, but they are so inconsistent still. That's why I feel those assets were mismanaged."
"Danny’s super up and down. To me he’s like a half-baked, directionless Morey in terms of his willingness to make moves. You’d be hard pressed a couple years ago to say Boston wasn’t one of the top situations in the league and that’s a direct result of his management post big 3. The Brooklyn trade and the Tatum-Fultz trade were absolute ace moves. Drafting outside of the top 5 and outside the lottery has been terrible and his Morey like “asset accumulation “ strategy and treatment of players as assets has hamstrung their ability to make this team better. They have little that fits outside Tatum-Brown-Smart, he got too cute trying to squeeze a good year out of Kemba then trade him (breaking news to him that everyone else knew Kemba’s on the small guard hard downslide too), the Myles Turner fuckup, dumping everyone’s homie IT and pissing off the leagues marquee FAs. He’s really screwed it the last couple of years.  I’m not surprised Celtics fans are coming around on Stevens, he got more goodwill than any coach in the league for being a good Xs and Os guy and looking like a good Boston man I guess, but his man management has been pretty sus since the Kyrie time. Boston media wanted to pin any and everything on Kyrie but I never saw how Brad’s reputation came out of that unscathed. Ok, now we know Brad can’t handle having dudes like Kyrie, Rozier, Marcus Morris on his team and he’s got Khemistry Kemba and young agreeable guys and shits not going right."
Also no Marcus Smart and a lack of good centers on the market has really hurt Boston
"They're similar in the role of glue-guy-power-forward  Barnes is obviously balling right now and RoCo isn't, but if Boston pulled the trigger on the RoCo trade instead of Portland in the offseason it would've been equally hailed as a great move.  Also to OP's credit, Boston's structured their contracts where it's been incredibly difficult to move mid-tier players. Their only real trade-able contract has been Marcus Smart who's more or less untradeable. The rest of the guys are either on fat extensions/contracts or cheap rookie deals. It's very difficult to get to 10M in matching salary without including 3 or so contracts with one of them being Daniel Theis who outperforms his contract."
"* **Marcus Smart:** the longest-tenured player on the team and emotional leader is out * **Jayson Tatum:** got COVID, has shown a lack of energy as the game goes on  * **Kemba Walker:** coming off an injury and is currently inconsistent    * **Danny Ainge:** the Celtics are one of the youngest teams in the league, hasn't/didn't traded assets for veteran win-now style players. * **Brad Stevens:** experiments with lineups all season long, at times to the detriment of regular-season wins (I guess in hopes of knowing what he can get out of matchups in the playoffs)  I have much higher expectations for this team and am definitely disappointed this season. The future still looks bright with the Celtics having key pieces locked up for the next 2-3 years on average. At the end of the day, I am grateful to have a team that is consistently competitive but I am becoming impatient watching teams like the rival Lakers winning rings."
"&gt;miss used so many of their   I think people are looking to clown DA...but it’s not like he let his war chest evaporate w nothing to show for it.  * BOS 2014 1st, tanking year: Marcus Smart  * BKN 2014 1st: James Young  * BKN 2016 1st: Jaylen Brown  * BKN 2017 1st: Jayson Tatum  * BKN 2018 1st: traded for Kyrie Irving  * SAC 2019 1st: Romeo Langford  * MEM 2020 1st: Aaron Nesmith  Langford/Nesmith are incomplete. Jays + Marcus are hits. James Young (at #17) was an obvious whiff, and you could make an argument that the Cs would have been better off not trading for Kyrie."
"Yep. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are bonafide stars, All-Defense 1st team Marcus Smart is out. Celtics will turn it around soon. These hot takes are so annoying"
"His defensive impact is overrated cause he’s got a reputation for being a “defensive stud” which is bullshit. If a regular player did half the shit he did , there’d be whistles. He gets off with a lot based off rep alone. He’s nothing Marcus Smart. I mean Smart flops a lot , but he’s always moving and stays ahead of whoever he’s guarding. Bev just plays physical and gets away w calls"
"Marcus Smart is the fan favorite scrappy physical pesky player than Bev could be, except Bev has to throw intentionally inuring players and mocking said injuries into the mix."
"i used to lowkey respect him cuz he got thr marcus smart dog mentality but he takes it too far and just goes for the player, not the ball."
"I despise that he gets so many comps to Marcus Smart. They are both defense-focused guards who flop, but Pat Bev is an asshole."
Patrick Beverly is what you get if you water down Marcus Smart then add a metric fuckton of Hot Sauce
"Marcus Smart doesn't make this team a magical championship contender. He doesn't fix the majority of the team's issues. And the injuries are being overblown. This team is only down one key rotation player, and that is Smart at the moment. We still look pretty bad. He'll add some defense, maybe a little playmaking, but we still have lots to do."
"In a season where both Jays are averaging career highs in points &amp; assists and still improving on the already high level they were each at and where Marcus Smart was playing the best ball of his career pre-injury I am not that disappointed even if their W/L record isn't where I'd like it to be.  Not to mention the progress from Time Lord and the fact that Payton Pritchard looks like a solid rotational player that the Celtics have under contract at a lower annual number than Jeff Teague makes this year for the next 4 seasons.  There's still tons of time left in this year, too."
"Tatum had COVID &amp; missed time.  Kemba clearly isn't healthy yet (though he is looking better lately), Marcus Smart (Celtics 3rd best player this year and heart &amp; soul of the team) has been out.  They replaced proven vets with young guys/rookies in a season without summer league, training camp, access to the G-League.  Is it ideal? No.  Is it a sign that the team is fundamentally broken? Also no."
"Marcus Smart has been injured. Give it time, he’s an integral part of this teams chance of success."
Marcus Smart would like a word
i'm sure it's just a coincidence that marcus smart always seems to be the guy who is violently shoved to the floor on every big play of every close game.
Yup. Marcus Smart had two GOAT flops against Harden back in the day. Back to back plays in the clutch.
https://official.nba.com/explanation-of-anti-flopping-rule/   https://www.nba.com/news/nba-fines-patrick-beverley-flopping  https://sports.yahoo.com/marcus-smart-fined-5k-flopping-223849087.html
"Falls in the 'Hate him if  he's not on my team' category for me. Other notable players in the category: Marcus Smart, Draymond Green."
Joel Embiid  Kawhi Leonard  Lu Dort  Marcus Smart  Ben Simmons
ik we're talking about flopping but it's also a clear uncalled travel on marcus smart in the play leading up to his flop at 3:55.
"Manu flopped more, he's the king of flopping. Even LBJ, Bosh and D-Wade are also known for it, and yeah Harden's in that same tier as those guys.  But Manu, Marcus Smart, PBev and Corey Brewer are generally considered the kings of the flop."
"Im a raptors fan, but i would also love the celtics if not for the flopster himself marcus smart, dude just isnt fun to watch so i dont wacht celtcis games"
"&gt; Teams think he can shoot, which he cannot. He shoots well below average, not a little bit, considering half his career is under 40% (unless he turns this Suns season around).  Teams don't think that at all. Do you think that teams don't have access to player stats or something? Teams know he isn't an efficient shooter, they just expect him to shoot 3s to space the floor.  &gt; and most of his teams learn that which is why he’s been on seven teams in 9 years.  Sure, lets go over his team changes.  Dallas -&gt; Boston: Traded for Rondo, a star player.  Boston -&gt; Cleveland: Traded for Kyrie, a star player.  Cleveland -&gt; Utah: Cleveland had a bad locker room situation and flipped half the roster.  Utah -&gt; Memphis: Traded for Conley, a star player.  Memphis -&gt; Miami: Traded for Winslow, a younger player with potential. Memphis had no reason to hold onto a vet on an expiring contract.  Miami -&gt; Phoenix: Crowder chose to sign with Phoenix over Miami.  Extremely disingenuous to frame this as teams trying to dump him because of his on-court play. Cleveland is the only team in his career that really wanted to get rid of him, and that was because of the team's locker room drama.  &gt; He’s not Tony Allen or Marcus Smart on defense, so you can’t weather his offensive liability. His intangibles aren’t Shane Battier-level like you’re saying, who could also shoot when you needed a bucket in the playoffs.  No one is claiming he's one of the best defenders in the league. However, there is a reason why he's been playing big minutes in the playoffs for teams for years.  &gt; Crowder is best as like a 7th man for cheap defense off the bench, or on a team with so much offense that they can let Crowder fight for jump balls and “hold” Giannis to like a 29/13/8 or whatever.  He literally just started every game in the playoffs for your heat as the biggest underdogs to make the finals in years. Him shooting 43% from 3 on 10 attempts per game in the bucks series is a massive reason why you upset them."
"Sorry yeah, meant 9 years. Will edit.  Teams think he can shoot, which he can’t. He shoots well below average, not a little bit, considering literally half his career is under 40% (unless he turns this Suns season around).  His defense and hustle and intangibles *aren’t* savant level. He’s not Tony Allen or Marcus Smart on defense, so you can’t weather offensive liability. His intangibles aren’t Shane Battier-level like you’re saying, who could also shoot when you needed a bucket in the playoffs.  Crowder is best as like a 7th man for heap defense off the bench."
Harden flopped his way to a victory but I took great offence when a Celtics fan said it was an all time flop in the thread.  No it really wasn't.   The all time flop is when Marcus Smart injured himself by flopping like he was getting electrocuted by Emperor Palpatine.  Harden's flop was good but it's not even in the same stratosphere as this one by Smart.
kyle lowry and marcus smart have pretty much lapped the field the last 5 or 6 years.  those dudes would have flown into the first row if they were selling that call.
"&gt; That’s an all time flop from Harden, lmao  Nah the all time flop is when Marcus Smart injured himself flopping.   It looked like Darth Sidious electrocuted him"
cant say much when marcus smart flopped 3 times in a row against harden a while back lmao
Marcus Smart vs James Harden
"Kemba has massively regressed, no longer have Hayward as a fourth option, and Marcus Smart hurt. They will turn it around but man, I didn’t think a top four seed was going to happen this year for the Raps but we have clawed our way back."
"Little of both. I think Marcus is obviously the C’s best and most versatile defender, and also kind of the emotional leader, so his absence is felt twofold. That said, the Celtics still give some pretty scrubby players solid playing time so it’s not like the roster is perfect once Smart is back."
"Okay and Celtics fans can say that they have Kemba coming off an injury, no Marcus Smart, and haven't had Daniel Theiss for some games. Everyone can make excuses lmao"

"The issue with the Celtics compared to some other eastern teams is that they are actually playing like a .500 team not just having the record, Raptors for example have not played like a .500 in a good month, there horrendous start just means they have to dig themselves out of the hole they made.   I still they they turn it totally around with Marcus Smart back, people forget he legitimately deserved at least some DPOY votes last year while being a guard. He contributes to winning basketball in a massive way."
He's an underrated player man. I've always said that he reminds me of Marcus Smart. A selfless player who pulls winning plays out of his ass (especially clutch rebounds) and is stronger than you might think.
"On Countdown ahead of Pelicans-Celtics, @wojespn reported that Marcus Smart is unlikely to come back before Boston returns from the All-Star Break next month."
"The way I see people talk about the Celtics, I think they’ve been writing them off way too soon. I know losing Gordon Hawyward was a big blow but I watched them ball out in the Playoffs last years without him for much of it. I think Marcus Smart being out is having a big impact, I think doubters aren’t giving him enough credit for how much he helps this team, and are underestimating the difference it’ll make when he comes back. Anyway, I’ve got no dog in this fight, just excited to watch the game"
"2019: Ben Simmons first team, missed 16 games  2019: Marcus Smart first team, missed 12 games  2017: Chris Paul first team, missed 21 games   2017: Beverly first team, missed 15 games  Let’s just not pretend that he missed for any other reason than the Pelicans were not good on defense or super relevant and voters by and large do not actually watch games and vote based on team ranking and who gets talked about the most"
Marcus Smart sends his regards
Marcus Smart and Kyle Lowry are the real Embiid stoppers. They flop every time they are switched on him and get the call 1/4 times. Which is damn good when you can give Joel a foul once every four times.
Oldest great still playing: LeBron  Baby goat: Doncic  Lamar:Harden  Donald: Giannis  Deshaun: KAT  Best Duo: LeBron and AD  Fastest player: DeAaron Fox  Strong for position: Marcus Smart  Drew Brees: Dwight howard  Barry Sanders: Chris paul  Jamarcus Russell: Darko Milicic
Marcus smart iwould be slept on for this tbh. And Kawhi
Marcus Smart isn’t even getting a 2nd team nod this year.
Not when Ben Simmons and Marcus Smart exist...
"Dame  Marcus Smart  Jerami Grant  RoCo  Bam   Bench: Lou Williams, Duncan Robinson, Joe Ingles, Royce O Neale, Richaun Holmes"
"Yeah, it's weird to see guys like Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell win the award over guys like Iggy and Marcus Smart."
Also Marcus smart
"All those guys will also be all stars though? Or at least should be by any measure. Celtics absolutely blow besides brown and tatum, and both are putting up all star level stats. They're .500 playing the least home games in the league (though that doesn't seem to matter too much this year) and Tatum being like 75% since covid. IDK normally I'd agree with you but it's basically these two all stars doing it all. With the guys you mentioned there are more competent role players and good players making up that gap. After Tatum and Brown it's...sore knee Kemba? Marcus smart jacking threes? Daniel Theis playing over his head? Idk it's ugly besides those two guys and if they weren't there the celtics would be like a 5 win team lol."
Replace Metu with Luka and JV with Marcus smart and people here would be calling for a firing squad LOL.
"Ohh right I see the point you’re trying to make now, it was a bit confusing. It’s also quite hard to label elite defenders because most DPOYs are big mans and then first team all Defense kinda guys are mostly still stars who do a lot of other things with the exception of guys like Marcus smart and Tony Allen who are less often represented in all Defense awards. You’re right in that even those classified as elite 3nD generally aren’t elite at both and still are stronger in one area. Most of the time they’re elite at defense for their role but not considered defensively elite overall in the nba"
"We're pretty close to it.   * The only team in the league with 2 all-stars under 25 (and they're both wings) * The 5th youngest roster in the league * All our own draft capital *  28.5m TPE * Marcus Smart + Kemba Walker * We can clear our cap space if we want, right as high-end FAs hit the market (Embiid, Jokic, Beal, etc)  We're incredibly well-positioned for the future.   A lot of the teams ahead in standings aren't better positioned than that. *eg. Denver has a bright future and have played better this season, but I'd take Boston's future comfortably.*"
Tough to be a contender when Marcus Smart is your 4th best player
"Marcus smart in the bench huh,"
"Marcus Smart was All-Defensive First Team the last two years, I swear people forget that he's out"
I keep seeing Marcus Smart and a bunch of other shit as the return for Collins. Idk it’s an interesting situation
I still can’t believe Marcus Smart attempted 22 3s in a game last season
"Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, or Marcus Smart."
Some of the names on this list are pretty wild. Marcus Smart hit 11 of 22 that one game lol... Allen Crabbe... https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/fg3a_game.html
"Marcus smart isn't shooting 39% from 3 on 9 attempts a game anywhere outside of the fucking bubble lmfao. That entire playoffs was an aberration. If the season just never halted due to corona and we had normal playoffs then the Bucks, who were looking like an all time great team, go to the finals."
"Jazz have beat:  *@ Blazers  *Clippers  *@ Bucks  *Bucks  Celtics  *@ Spurs  @ Nuggets  *Warriors  *Mavericks  *Mavericks  @ Pacers  *Heat   *Led by 20  Only Marcus Smart, Goran Dragic, and Jrue Holiday are meaningful players that missed a game here. Jazz were missing Mitchell in both Dallas wins, Conley in the @ Pacers, Heat, Milwaukee, and Boston wins.  Jazz beat the spread in all of these games. Jazz beat the spread tonight. Jazz were missing Conley tonight again."
Imagine if Marcus smart took that 3.....
"How the hell does he get 18mpg  Brad Stevens needs to get a grip on some things, like Marcus Smart shooting too many threes despite being ass at them, giving minutes to some really questionable players"
Marcus Smart and Beverley
"Marcus Smart is an average shooter but somehow holds the franchise record for most 3s in a game. This is a franchise that had Larry Bird, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, prime Isaiah Thomas, etc. in it lol"
Davis is hard because he’s very unique. I’d say most similar to Hakeem (also unique in different ways lol) just based on athleticism and being dominant on both sides. Both have insane accuracy when blocking shots and timing to contest without fouling.   Kawhi is a more skilled but less athletic Pippen.   Marcus Smart is a pocket sized Ron Artest.   Can’t think of anyone like Ben Wallace. Just a weird combo to be such an amazing defensive specialist while being that short as a center.   I think Chris Paul and Jason Kidd are pretty similar.
Someone better tell Jimmer that he is more valuable than Marcus Smart then.
"Jaylen Brown, Christian Wood, Domantas Sabonis, Marcus Smart, idk, dozens of other contracts."
bench of  Morris twins  Patrick Beverley  Dellavedova  Marcus Smart
If the Celtics traded Marcus Smart for Luka Doncic their defense would decline too. Doesn’t mean its not a good trade lol
Ah yes my Danny Ainge tactic. Wait until the Lebron is gone and someone trades me KD for Marcus Smart
"Boston. Jayson, Jaylen, Kemba, Timelord, a random player on a 28 million contract, marcus smart, and Payton Pritchard"
Marcus smart? More like Marcus Dumb lmao
Ehhh Marcus Smart but yeah Dort’s great
"but he's clearly not a terrible defender either who will single-handedly tank your defense unless you put the all-defense first team around him. it's not like Nuggets defense gets so much better when you take Jokic off the floor.   there's a difference between ""perfect roster"" and ""optimal roster"". Denver's best perimeter defenders are what, Gary Harris, 35 year old Millsap and PJ Dozier? someone fill me in if i'm forgetting anyone. that's so far off of ""optimal"".   i'm not saying you have to get Marcus Smart, Ben Simmons and Giannis to make that defense work. just don't put him out there with MPJ's and 5'10 point guards you brought in from Europe for some reason."
"What the hell does this mean? That's like calling Steve Nash the offensive version of Marcus Smart.  Offensive savants like Nash and Jokic will always be far more valuable than even the best defense-first player. The recency bias and circlejerking in this sub are so tiring, people already forget how good Jokic has been this season and, apparently, his ridiculous playoff stats the last two years."
"Wall had Beal and Porter shooting at 60% TS and still couldn’t beat the Celtics in that 2017 series. funny enough, Wall was the only person in that series that played meaningful minutes yet shot well under league average TS. the only people who were comparatively worse were Marcus Smart and Brandon Jennings lol. what makes you think him and PG woulda been a *guarantee* for WCF, Chuck?   Wall may be comparable in some rights to WB, but he’s not better. don’t get fooled by the r/NBA circlejerks, WB has done far more than Wall with far less. Wall’s still capable but he isn’t that sort of game changer for teams. certainly not after an achilles tear lmao. no idea where you got that idea from, but it couldn’t be further from reality."
"Hes ""Marcus Smart at home"". A lot of winning plays, not necessarily the most gaudy stats and some frustrating offensive possessions but he can contribute to a winning team for sure"
The sixers got outplayed by Marcus smart in the first round lol
"You have those 2 and Marcus Smart, literally one piece away from beating the Lakers this year, just a matter of trading Kemba."
"Dude, we're treading old ground here. You [already admitted](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kq1o6b/kerr_on_the_steph_disrespect_hes_63_180lbs_so_he/gi4s3z0?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) to not understanding what point OP was making, but then you [went back](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kq1o6b/kerr_on_the_steph_disrespect_hes_63_180lbs_so_he/gi68d2n?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) to your straw man after I pointed out that it was a fair reply. Also, you didn't ask OP shit. Your [first comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kq1o6b/kerr_on_the_steph_disrespect_hes_63_180lbs_so_he/gi1qxzj?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) in this thread is a reply to me. You asked ME and like I said, that while there's a discussion to be had there, it's not the point OP was making.   &gt; But Draymond alone, especially this Draymond, does not make up for the other deficiencies of the 2021 squad.    I don't care if it's current-form Draymond Green. He still obviously brings more to the table than 2017 Andre Roberson. This is an almost objectively true statement. The warriors wouldn't trade 2017 Roberson for '21 Draymond and I think most Thunder fans would trade '17 Roberson for Draymond without question. Also, who's arguing that Draymond makes up for all the deficiencies of the squad? I'm asking because it sure as hell wasn't me.   &gt; The squad WB ran with couldn’t give him what he needed most, but it gave him the 2nd and 3rd best thing he needed most, defense and the capacity to play at high usage. If I had to build a team around Steph smart playmakers would be what I’d go for first, then defense and shooting   What do you mean by ""capacity to play at a high usage""? You mean low-usage players, aka no all-stars? Aka, no help?   Warriors get players to buy into their system, they don't always come in being intelligent passers. Look at a guy like Javale McGee or Zaza Pachulia.  &gt; To call Steph as an inept defender is wild at this point. The man is a slightly above average defensive point guard. He’s even better than WB at it.   Are you always going to try to address trivial? points? I don't care how good a PG defender Steph is, he's not Marcus smart. He's going to need bigger wings to carry the bulk of defensive responsibility."

"Bad take, the Cs were up 72-71 with 6 minutes left and lost 87-79. They gave up 13 points in a little over 5 minutes before they started intentional fouling (the last 3 points for the Cavs). They shot like total shit as a collective in those 6 minutes too.  Smart was 0-1 from 3, and 1-2 from the line  Horford was 0-2, including 0-1 from 3  Marcus Morris was 1-3, including 0-2 from 3, and 1-2 from the line   Rozier was 0-2 from 3  Tatum was 0-1  Jaylen was 1-2 from 3.  That's 2-11 from the field, including 1-7 from 3 if you're counting. And 2-4 at the line for what it's worth.  For the game, Brown was 3-12 and Rozier was 0-10 from 3. 3-22 between them isn't gonna cut it.  The 6 extra free throws the Cavs got (25 vs 19) was not the difference maker, especially since 4 of those foul shots were intentional fouls. The real number is 21 vs 19."
"Marcus Smart is not a high usage player, and he doesn't always have the ball in his hands like a Lebron or Jokic. You're just repeatedly proving my point."
"James Harden does make that pass, and you keep talking about the best passers in the NBA making the pass, case in point. Theyre theonly guys who do it on the regular. Guys like Marcus Smart do it occasionally. Im not saying its some other worldly pass, just an impressive play worthy of a highlight.  Anybody coming on this post and trying to minimize it is just a bozo. Appreciate a nice play"
"It was going to be so goddamn fun, I'm genuinely disappointed that we missed out on it. Losing a couple regular season games, who gives a shit? Getting to watch Marcus Smart take 40 shots in a game? That's a once in a lifetime opportunity."
Jrue Holiday  Marcus Smart  James Harden  The Holy Trinity of Guard Post Defenders
Plus now he doesn't have to deal with Marcus smart doing dumb shit. He's a great defender but there are times where it seems like he thinks he's the number one option with all of his shitty isos
"NGL, I'm a Celtics fan and genuinely disappointed we didn't get to see two games with Marcus Smart and the Boston Red Claws.  Guaranteed Tacko time is must see TV."
"Marcus Smart can ""get hot like Duncan Robinson"" in the same way Terry Rozier can ""get hot like Kyrie Irving"". Sure, maybe for like a full quarter four times a season, but that's hardly even worth mentioning"
are you asking if i'd rather have Smart+Robinson or two Marcus Smarts
Plays defense like Marcus Smart but is a big goofy 7 footer.
"exactly, it's like getting mad at marcus smart.  if the refs fall for it for a decade straight, at some point it seems like it's their fault."
"i mean guys like derek fisher and marcus smart have flopped their whole careers and the refs keep buying it no matter how many times they watch tape later and see they were wrong.  at some point, it's not the player's fault."
"no use in arguing with someone who thinks the Celtics could trade Marcus Smart for Bradley Beal or comments ""this is why I stay away from the game threads"" and then has 75% of their comments in game threads.  Best of luck to you, pal."
So they’ll probably be starting Jeff Teague Payton Prichard  Aaron nesmith  Marcus smart Daniel theis
Exactly. Spot on ... we were ready to fucking tread out a G-League lineup with Marcus Smart at PF with our 8.
"Harden isn't even foul baiting like that lol he's only averaging 7.9 FTA this season. Marcus Smart is more of a flopper than Harden is, ""Celtics fan"".  Some foul baiting tactics are very annoying and not fun to watch, even from my favorite player, though. I just don't think he's as bad about it as you say. Dame and Trae have been worse lately, imo."
"Who's getting FMVP is the more interesting question, Marcus Smart or Tacko Fall?"
"Lmfao that reminds me of Wob's version from the Cs series. He captioned it ""Kyle Lowry and Marcus Smart guarding each other"" and both spidermen were on the ground pointing up"
"Marcus Smart for Boston, easily. The team runs through the Jays, as it should, but Smart is holding the team together. He’s savvy enough to guard 1-4 defensively, he’s capable of running the offense or playing off ball, he fights for loose balls and rebounds, he’ll call anyone out for not giving 100%, bulldog mentality.   His shot selection frustrates the fuck out of me sometimes, but he does so much that doesn’t show up in box scores."
"Dorts obviously an amazing on ball defender, but man Marcus is so versatile and so smart (no pun intended) that he brings stuff to the table that Dort doesn't"
Marcus Smart
I dont think youve watched much Marcus Smart this year. He hasnt been that good defensively
I stand by my prediction that Marcus Smart will be the first guard to win DPOY since the glove.
can't wait to watch Marcus Smart and Payton Pritchard put up 40
"Good lord.  5 (4 are 6'1 and under) point guards, a shooting guard and 2 centers.  And on top of that, 4 of them are the 14th-17th guys on the bench.  Legitimately will probably see Marcus Smart be the primary power forward these next few games."
"Marcus Smart can guard most small ball 4s so that shouldn't be much of a problem.    Rebounding is a different story, but they'll be fine. Miami is a 7 point favorite I think Boston covers the spread."
Marcus Smart is going to shoot 80 threes tonight and break the single game record
"[Marcus Smart, Jeff Teague, Payton Pritchard, Carsen Edwards, Tremont Waters, Aaron Nesmith, Daniel Theis and Tacko Fall](https://twitter.com/TimBontemps/status/1348353329529761793)"
Marcus smart either goes for 50 with or for 3/22
"ok so i just looked up his bbref page and yeah, last year was his only good year shooting from deep. for some reason i thought his percentages were higher than they were  still, he changed his mechanics up and his shots a lot more fluid now. shot 37.5% last year on 400 attempts which is a decent (tho not great, could very well still be a fluke) sample size. hes shown in the past both in the nba and in college an ability to get hot from 3. i dont think its outta the question to expect a marcus smart type of development with his shot where he goes from bad to legit good over time"

"Yea, a Eastern Conference contending team left after that season: Rozier, Marcus Morris, Baynes, Kyrie Irving and Al Horford.  Even with those departures the Jays/Kemba/Hayward/Theis and Smart helped bring the team to a Eastern Conference Final in '19-'20."
yeah but come on we literally can look up [2017 Lonzo rookie highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtnQjJCdYd8) and he was dishing everywhere.  I love Lamelo and personally think he will be great.  Just wait til players like Marcus Smart are on him and not Kevin Huerter and Nickeil Alexander Walker
Sounds like Marcus Smart alright
"Well you can look at the Celtics, if Brown, Ojeleye and Green are out due to safety protocols related to Tatum's positive case.   They'd be looking at Carsen Edwards, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Jeff Teague, Marcus Smart, Tremont Waters, Daniel Theis and Tacko Fall.  That's 6 guards 6'4 and under (4 under 6'1), Theis and Fall.  0-7 waiting to happen in the next two weeks if they're forced to play and Brown, Ojeleye and Green are held out."
"Jokic is fuckin worse than Harden, Trae, Lowry, and Marcus Smart at the amount of times this dude flops"
"Marcus Smart wasnt kidding last year when he said he coulda taken more 3's in that game that he put up 22, we're about to see that also"
Oh baby here comes Marcus Smart as a SECOND OPTION. Holy moly! Oh my gosh! Hold on to your butts folks!
"Mine might be a little too early to call dead wrong, but I've always been convinced marcus smart would be a superstar if he ever was able to be consistent on offense. The short periods where he gets hot it looks unstoppable."
"He can be, but he said the biggest thing he's working on this season is shot selection so at least he's aware. We've lived and died on the marcus smart 3 during the playoffs so sometimes it's something you deal with, but I'm optimistic about the improvement."
Marcus smart would be excellent for them no?
Say that to Marcus Smart
Marcus smart is better than pat bev at literally every aspect of basketball
marcus smart is just a worse pat bev with a bigger fanbase and i'm not afraid to say it
"jerami grant beat marcus smart on the break once i think, but he gathered the ball to dunk instead of laying it up and that small thing allowed the defender to recover and beat his shit. just an example."
"Brad Stevens should start Payton Pritchard. Until Smart learns to make smart passes, shoot rational shots, and reduce turnovers, Pritchard should start. Pritchard is way better at drawing off defenders and creating an open shot for others. He also makes consistently good passes and knocks down his shots at a high field goal percentage, better than Marcus. And Teague has as little seniority as Pritchard and can’t finish at the rim."
bruh. assist numbers are not the end all be all of playmaking. Do you really think Marcus Smart is a better playmaker than Curry cuz he has more assists in a 8 game sample size? done arguing cuz ur a casual
"This game sucked.  Observation:  On paper the Wizard's roster looks decent but, man these dudes can't guard anyone. Like every single person on that team consistently gets beaten off the dribble. The only person who doesn't get beaten off the dribble consistently is Hachimura.  Brad Beal is a mad man hell bent on scoring. Watching him touch the ball makes me anxious.  Marcus Smart is the ultimate wildcard. Seriously dude is just insane.  Westbrook doesn't look good. Dude took like 4 corner 3. Why is he taking corner 3s? His takes shots are wild/low quality"
Marcus Smart was not the smartest guy on the floor tonight.
Marcus Smart is such a clown
Marcus Smart operates under strange physics.
meanwhile r/bostonceltics is ready to launch brad stevens and marcus smart into the sun
Classic Marcus smart pass
Marcus Smart post ups are life
That Marcus Smart spin holy shit!
Drink every time Marcus Smart jacks up a three after Tatum goes to the bench
Marcus smart is a player a team like the celtics would be trying to trade for. That’s why they haven’t gotten rid of him
Not Marcus Smart.
"Marcus Smart: 1st team all defense, above average (though often head scratching) 3 point shooting, and the ability to run the offense for a few minutes while kemba/Tatum sit. He’s a fucking stud."
Marcus. Smart.
"Marcus Smart. Can run some offense for you if needed, incredible defender 1-5, spaces the floor, great leader and teammate, will do all the little things to help the team win"
"agreed.  BTW I don't really buy any Harden-to-Boston buzz.  The Celtics are a fashionable team to throw into these scenarios because they have young stars/coveted assets (more so when they had extra picks but they still have Brown/Tatum/Smart) and Danny is known as a ruthless trader (for good reason). Leaking rumors about Boston's involvement helps Houston's leverage to maximize a return from elsewhere, if they can act like Jaylen Brown &amp; Marcus Smart are on the table that might put pressure on another team to improve their offer."
Mikal brides or Marcus smart are the top for me
Marcus Smart.
If we could give 6+ inches of Tacko height to Marcus Smart I’d pencil us in to a top 3 seed. He’s got the mind of a GOAT center trapped in him.
"IMO that's not a ""role player"", and the names already tossed out here are looking better than role players.    Role players are guys who very rarely (if ever) have a major impact on a team, but do have a well-defined role in the rotation.  Guys like Marcus Smart and Joe Harris are very big parts of their teams.  They can regularly go out there and score 20+, or in Smart's case literally control games with his defense/hustle.  Danny Green is a great example of an elite role player."
"Draymond Green in his prime except he was an all-star.  Otherwise, Marcus Smart makes sense."
I would like to nominate Marcus smart
"Lol y'all are gonna talk while Marcus ""The Big Flop"" Smart is on your team? Ok 😂"
"&gt;You are never getting that call with the game on the line.  &gt;There was barely any contact, and Smart flopping (as he always does) made it even more unlikely he was going to get the call.   Can you even read? It's a foul, just a very weak one that you are never going to get with the game on the line as floppin-ass marcus smart."
"marcus smart could stab a man and daniel theis would get called for the foul, worst whistle in the league"
2018 CP3 / Prime Harden / 2013 Korver / 2016 Draymond / 2019 Ibaka Bench: Present Smart /  Marcus Morris / Prime Lopez   Just put defense and shooting around two all time playmakers
I’d like to add Marcus Smart and playoff Rondo to that list.
Marcus Smart and Patrick Beverly leads the league in Flops per 36 minutes.   Pat Bev leads the league in Flagrant 2 Flops.
"The league doesn't really give a shit about this. In the past 5 years, only Marcus Smart, Pat Bev and Isaiah Thomas have been fined for flopping. (Besides Ball)"
"LeBron, Marcus Smart, PatBev, a lot of the NBA flops."
Smart almost getting a tech at the end there is so very Marcus.
"Pritchard is really a gamer, just seems to be such a positive force whenever he's in there. Teammates seem to love him too!  &amp;#x200B;  Smart got fouled so hard there that Bam and Robinson kind of went limp to try and prevent the whistle which allowed PP to sneak in haha, glad Marcus didn't get T'd up (prob deserved to) but that was a terribly officiated final few minutes."

But he literally had a hand in his face and Marcus Smart less than 2 inches from his body even before he jumped. How do you take and make that shot look
Lol damn the mic picked up on Marcus smart pretty well there
Marcus Smart is screaming in the #Celtics locker room and there is a bunch of arguing going on. Smart comes out say “y’all on that bullshit!” Team is imploding. Smart is in bathroom and there is still screaming coming from locker room.
Marcus Smart and Alexander-Walker.
"If we’re doing this, I just want to say I fucking love Marcus Smart"

Ha that sequence had to include a Marcus Smart flop
"There were plenty of playoff games where Marcus Smart took the same or more FGAs as Brown. And it was hardly just teams leaving him open to shoot open jumpers, he was trying to force creating his own shots for no reason too. Dude just needs to chill on trying to become a scorer"
"Yeah I know it wasn't a dig at marcus man, I just didnt understand the justification being based off of that when smart places highly among charges taken each and every year.   You made a weird justification and i questioned it."
Neymar has nothing on Marcus smart.
"Assuming it’s a 1 game suspension for each bad flop, Marcus Smart would be playing 41 games tops"
Marcus smart felt guilty he didn’t want to look at Embiid lmao
Marcus Smart is a bad influence
"Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, TJ Warren"
Marcus Smart
"I think the punishment should definitely go up to suspension for the worst offenders. Embellishing contact is one thing, but making up contact (like when Marcus Smart threw himself on the baseline and hurt his wrist) should be considered cheating."
Why did jaylen brown and Marcus smart just ignore pritchard afterward?
He didn't get hit lol. He flopped harder than marcus smart. 😂 STFU
"I still have no idea why Marcus Smart is allowed to take many shots or handle the ball so much, he is an ass offensive player who is a career 37% FG shooter  He should be taking max 7-8 shots not 12 shots like he does"
"And this is probably our biggest improvement over last season.   Brown used to need other guys on the floor to at least create some space. Tatum was our only guy who could carry the bench. Otherwise, he'd get trapped and turn the ball over.  Now he's scoring +25 a night while sharing the court with Marcus Smart, Grant Williams and two centers on the floor.  I didn't really agree with Boston focusing purely on shooters in the draft, but watching what the Jays are doing without any spacing makes it clear.   These two with a Joe Harris, Seth Curry, Buddy Hield, JJ Redick, etc would be absolutely unreal."
??? Marcus Smart doesn't take charges now? He's one of the best wing/guard defenders in the league.
Guinness world record for most flops in a season- Marcus Smart
"Took his own teammate out for a flop, Marcus Smart influence in flopping is spreading to his co workers. Lol"
marcus smart team btw
Marcus Smart doesn’t shoot that many free throws
Says the guy with Marcus Smart on his team.
"He’s incredibly clutch on defense, it’s kinda unreal  Marcus Smart’s the same way, in any close game, you can rely on them to make some really smart, high effort play that swings things for their team"
Same with Marcus Smart
The contact was Marcus Smart using his off arm.  Bad call
Marcus “Not so Smart” is boutta ruin Brown’s great game...
Marcus Smart flopped so hard he hurt his wrist. He should never talk about someone else flopping.
did anyone actually say that?  we just loled because marcus smart was the one saying it..
Embiid didnt even complain... meanwhile marcus smart was bitching at the refs the whole first quarter after flopping on a rebound vs Embiid. Not sure what height has to do with it
"Marcus Smart isnt  a 6'10"" 300lb baby though. Embiid is a post player. He should expect contact. Not saying the refs arent being shit rn, but he's being a fucking baby"
Loo your team has marcus smart
The marcus smart special
Marcus Smart is NBA's Meryl Streep
"I don't think anybody, even Celtics fans, say that Marcus Smart doesn't flop, I think you might need to work on reading comprehension"
Marcus Smart has made $40 million in his career so far but has somehow never considered visiting a dermatologist
I hate how Marcus Smart always shoots lights out against us and then will go 0/7 from 3 against Charlotte.
How can a Celtics fan say without a hint of irony that Marcus smart isn’t the worst flopper in the league. He’s probably the worst flopper in nba history
joel intentionally and skillfully draws contact while marcus smart and jaylen brown throwing themselves to the ground
Fuck Marcus Smart  All my homies hate Marcus Smart
That Marcus smart flop hahahahhaah
Marcus Smart would actually start sobbing on the court
1) Joel Embiid   2) Marcus Smart  3) Doc Rivers
how did this get downvoted?  i've watched the nba for 30 years and never seen anyone berate refs more without a technical than draymond.  like just straight up yelling in their faces.  might as well have gotten downvoted for saying marcus smart flops.

I see them get disappointed a lot and there play quality gotta down. They need someone like Marcus Smart or Draymond who lights a fire in times like that.
Marcus smart will absolutely not even be close to the goat with currys jumper
Marcus Smart.
Marcus Smart
Marcus Smart as a primary option on a bad team would have some abysmal efficiency but boy would he stuff the stat sheet. He'd be a non superstar version of Westbrook from a few years ago but with elite defense
I don't think Marcus Smart could ever score 20ppg
I love Marcus Smart
"Marcus Smart talking about flailing or flopping. He can write a book about it once he retires. It would be his bestseller, his life's achievement."
Marcus Smart is the only man I've seen flail more excessively than Lowry. Not a compliment.
"Yeah if he’s with Marcus Smart and Kemba he is a forward.  Also positionally speaking its all primary defensive matchups and who the other team defends you with.  If Tatum and Brown are playing, most teams want bigger wings on them."
Yeah idk why I capitalized 'smart'.  I meant smart not Marcus Smart lol
marcus smart imo
Wasn’t there a thread on this topic a day or two ago? Fairly sure Marcus smart has more FTA than FGA or whatever that thread was saying...
As a Kansas fan  Marcus Smart is a huge POS
Kudos Marcus Smart sportsmanship offering hand to get him up off the floor.
"Yeah, followed by the broadcasters looking at the play and saying he definitely got fouled.  Wasn't the philly broadcasters so they didn't have a horse in that race.  Meanwhile Marcus smart screamed cause he didn't get a foul when thybulle literally stayed on his feet to contest a shot"
"Lmaooooo, I know you aint really mean it when you have Marcus 'King of the Flops' Smart on your team."
"Drawing fouls has always been part of basketball. Does Embiid exaggerate contact? Absolutely, just like Marcus Smart, Lebron, Bradley Beal, and just about every other contact drawing player in the league. It’s part of the game."
"I don't think he has more flops per game, but if they tracked flop% then his flop% would absolutely be much higher. He's like that sparkplug scorer off the bench who doesn't get a ton of minutes but has like a 40% usage rate during his time on the court. That's Marcus Smart but with flops. He's a great defender, but the rest of his game is limited so he flops as much as he can to make up for his limitations."
You can’t think of any other reasons the #1 option on a team whose game largely revolves around the paint would have more FTAs than Marcus Smart?
"Man, imagine being called a flopper by Marcus Smart"
Someone send that one clip of marcus smart flopping from shaqtin fool
probably like a khris middleton and marcus smart
Marcus smart gets offended at flopping?!?!
"He might be a nominee, but he’s not going to win with Marcus Smart on the floor."
Joel Embiid 100% flops a ton. To be called out by Marcus Smart who also flops a ton is hysterical.   Both know how to take advantage of who is guarding them and how to draw contact. It’s frustrating for opposing fans but important in game settings.
"Joel embiid is just a taller, more talented, sexier Marcus smart."
"I would LOVE for you to actually address the main point of what I'm saying instead of condescendingly assuming we ""don't know the rules"", which is that Theis call is called but Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker, and Marcus Smart are driving and not getting foul calls. Celts shot 21% from the paint. You're saying that was all clean and good?  I've said from the beginning this is a consistency argument."
"Uh yeah I do. Tatum is also a very good defender and Javonte Green made multiple costly mistakes down the stretch. We also had a few stretches where Marcus Smart was our only starter playing, when normally we have one of Brown or Tatum in at all times. While Smart played well, Tatum scores more and more efficiently. And really the biggest thing is that we had every chance to pull ahead, but down the stretch we really struggled to get into our sets and get good looks because we were missing our best player. Not saying you specifically, but I don’t think people realize how much we play through Tatum—his on/off stats over the last couple seasons are insane."
This is the worst basketball take I’ve ever seen. Marcus Smart is an all-NBA defender who’s been in the running for DPOTY a couple times. Curry is a role player/low-end starter
What the fuck was going on with Marcus Smart. He had a couple ridiculous shots that should have not gone in
Marcus Smart is just different. I don't think anyone understands it but we go along with it
marcus smart team btw
Imagine having Marcus Smart as your flair and whining about guys drawing fouls lmao
Hey if Marcus smart can play like he did tn u bet ur ass I’m scared
"marcus smart is pretty big, but idk if he is the biggest on the court"
Simmons got a bunch of nut huggers on this site.i wouldnt say he sucks because great defenders cannot suck but he’s a bigger Marcus smart in my opinion.
Did marcus smart take 20 free throws?
Celtic fans spent half the game defending Marcus Smart and now y’all talking bout Embiid?
Yeah Marcus smart is really annoying
Your flair is Marcus smart
Think of him as a really tall Marcus Smart
Because your superstars of Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart are deserving...
Every time a Sixer's fan complains about the refs marcus smart becomes more powerful
marcus smart shouldnt be allowed to hold the ball
I hate Marcus smart cus he always make bullshit prayers against us haha
Another Marcus Smart flop. What a surprise.
😂 what was that Marcus smart shot
"he's really not a solid shooter -- he plays with the confidence of one, and his form is good enough that when he makes shots it looks right that they're falling, but his splits have really not improved and are consistently terrible especially considering the volume. i say this as a huge marcus smart fan."
Poor mans marcus smart
Marcus Smart and Peyton Pritchard seem like they’d be the most annoying backcourt defensively.  No lazy dribbles or passes
"Congrats to Marcus Smart, the heart and soul of the gritty and beloved 2020-21 Celtics."
"I somewhat agree, but it's closer than you think tbh. Box scores don't say anything about defense though so you kind of lost all credibility here.   The teams Lonzo has been on have never had a defensive identity.   You put Marcus Smart on any roster and he's going to bring an entire culture of defense to that team. It's who he is. He's the heart beat of the Celtics defense, and saying Lonzo is that type of player shows youre not really looking at this close enough.   Ive watched both and I'd say they're pretty even players.    But yeah, considering Lonzo is younger, better player maker and better scorer, they're extremely close but just very different players overall."
Marcus Smart
"I personally cannot think of any team that would pay over 80m for Marcus Smart.   Maybe I’m thinking wrong, can you give me some examples? The pelicans maybe?"
"It is about the playoffs because the playoffs matter infinitely more than the regular season and players are game planned around in the playoffs to a much larger extent.   Throughout his entire career Marcus Smart has played incredible in the playoffs, throughout his entire career Fournier has sucked and been targeted.   Marcus Smart is simply a better player than Fournier, especially when it matters."
Smart is always in trade talks. I think having that in the contract helps to assuage any anxiety he has each all star break. I like the move and is probably favorable for Marcus. I feel the Cs need to rehab their image for free agents a little bit and something like this helps.
"You def don't watch celtics games lol Smart plays his best alongside the Jays, when Jaylen had his best stretch of the season a majority of his shots were assisted by Marcus. He has great assist numbers with Tatum as well while being able to focus on defense with them handling scoring. And his defense declined this season bc he was injured in the beginning then missed 1/3 of the season with a calf sprain, then by the end of the regular season he was playing elite defense again. He was great in the Nets series."
"That’s cool and all but Evan Fournier was absolutely horrendous in the playoffs and got targeted on every single possession. Not only that but he couldn’t even do the one thing he’s supposed to do, offense. He was a -46 against the Nets. During that series not only did Marcus play elite defense and not get targeted but he averaged 3 more points per game, 5 more assists per game, and was more efficient from the field.  Evan Fournier is in no way better than Marcus Smart, especially not when it matters.  Edit: and by the way, Marcus can shoot, it’s not 2015 anymore. He has gravity and is a 38% shooter when open."
Marcus Smart is overrated IMO
Yah no ones paying marcus smart more than the boston celtics. Sure he could've opted out of his contract but he'd literally be Dennis schroeder 2.0.  P.S Have fun being mediocre.
"I couldn't be happier about this. Of course Smart is a talented player, but more than that he really is the heart of this team. And Brad extending him might help go against the old (justified) notion of the Celtics organization not being loyal to their playerers under Ainge. One thing you know you're getting with Marcus every day is commitment, leadership, and hard work which is invaluable when trying to build a contending team"
marcus smart is [definitely not](https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1=smartma01&amp;p1yrfrom=2021&amp;player_id2=fournev01&amp;p2yrfrom=2021) better than evan fournier lol
They got Marcus smart and Dennis Schroder for the price of a Dennis Schroder last year
Marcus Smart is making Duncan Robinson money
"I thought you were banned. We get it, you’re a salty Raptors fan, and yes, Marcus Smart is a better player than Evan Fournier in case you were wondering."
"How the fuck is this an overpay people, did you even watch Marcus Smart play?"
If zion commanded a max since his first game it doesn't seem right that he is forced into this artificial salary range.   Also if a team wants to extend a player like Marcus Smart to a 200 million deal they should be able to. An arbitrary max on what Smart can receive seems contrived.
Marcus Smart. Celtics Dumb.
Everything about this deal makes sense except the trade kicker. A trade kicker for Marcus Smart?
"Plenty are. CP, Trae, Lou Will, LeBron, Lowry. Marcus Smart injured himself flopping lmfao. TMac Wade and Kobe baited fouls plenty on their pump fakes. Reggie Miller notorious for kicking out.  Shane Battier made a career out of face guarding AND taking as much charges as humanly possible.  Like 90% of the league tilt their heads back and scream on drives and the refs.  This is the NBA. People will do whatever it takes to get an edge over their opponents. Some players even try to injure their opponents whether intentionally or from pure negligence (Bev, Bruce fucking Bowen, Zaza, Wade)"
I would be so ecstatic if Davion becomes Sacramento Marcus Smart. I love that dude
Marcus Smart isn’t going to start at PG
After watching that Marcus Smart video I’d be impressed if the ball made it back to my hand without being stolen after one dribble.
"I think people need to reassess what the expected return should be for a mid to late lotto pick. If Davion Mitchell is the kings version of Marcus Smart, it's a good pick, even with Fox/Haliburton ahead of him."
"Not superstar high on him, but I think Fultz could be an All-Star someday. He's only 23 right now and he kind of fits this Marcus Smart type of role rn, although his motor isn't as high, he has better creation and potential. If he can stay healthy I could see him climbing back."
"Same. He’s worth the gamble. Worse case scenario is that he becomes a taller and more athletic Marcus Smart, which is still a useful player."
What big free agents did the Celtics have when they made the playoffs after trading KG and PP?  Here was the roster for most of the season:  Avery Bradley/Evan Turner/Tyler Zeller/Brandon Bass/Marcus Smart  So don’t give me that small market bullshit. Plenty of other small market teams haven’t had the draft luck that the cavs have had and still at least make the playoffs.  Cavs have two modes: Lebron or bottom 5 team. There’s no in between.
"Yeah, the reaction from Marcus Smart shove is proper and last one is basically him properly drawing a charge. But overreaction from tiny shoves still falls under the definition of a ""flop"" according to NBA rules. ""The main factor in determining whether a player committed a flop is whether his physical reaction to contact with another player is inconsistent with what would have been expected given the force or direction of the contact."" But considering players can usually get away from playing rough against big men, combined with the usual ineptitude of zebras, can't blame him for exaggerating the contact."
Say whatever about Trae’s drawing fouls but he doesn’t fall to the ground every damn time. My dudes 160 and 6’1 you got a two fifty plus seven footer hitting the floor from Marcus smart lmfao
"It's funny that people are arguing about the technique Marcus Smart uses and saying theirs is ""better"".  Like my guy this is someone who can get steals on Kyrie. I'm goin with his technique over yours."
"I wouldn't be opposed to you thinking that he won't be a top 10 player. But your reasons aside from his need to improve his playmaking is pretty inaccurate.  He's one of the better defenders in the team. After Marcus Smart, he was arguably the best help defender for the C's, and his on-ball defense is certainly an asset.  He got more rebounds last season than Siakam, Zion, KD, and Ben Simmons. Not sure how you'd consider that as ""below average rebounding""."
I think having a Marcus Smart (or a Draymond Green) in your ear helps a lot to put more effort on D.   Horford will also help to teach the non-guards something about it. C's should be good on D this year.
Marcus Smart has not been a major flopper in like 3 seasons. I get his reputation for his first 3 or 4 seasons is bad because he was definitely pretty egregious back then but the man has maybe 2 or 3 bad flops a season over the past 3 seasons. He's nowhere as egregious as a lot of other well known floppers.
Not a basketball play- but him getting a bad case of conjunctivitis is a very Marcus Smart play.
The play that starts at 1:37 [here](https://youtube.com/watch?v=UOea2dBRPJc&amp;feature=share)  Sorry can’t figure out how to timestamp it from the app  Although all the possessions in this video are very on brand for Marcus smart
That’s why they call him Marcus SMART
"These are not career highlights. This is simply clips from one game. Anybody's career highlights are going to be impressive.   Julius Erving played against both Jerry West and Michael Jordan. He considered West to be [better](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2941387-julius-erving-leaves-lakers-lebron-james-off-his-top-2-all-time-nba-teams). Even if you don't buy that, I think it is a stretch to think that Marcus Smart is better than West."
I'm never gonna forget Marcus smart turning into peak Curry against us for a quarter
"Pre-draft people were comparing Davion Mitchell to Marcus Smart, and god do I hope that pans out—I fucking LOVE Marcus Smart.  (The Jrue Holiday comps are cool too)"
Marcus Smart 👍🏽
Smart Marcus
Marcus *SMART
He’d be like a super Marcus Smart. Would be an All-Star.
"Hot take, but if you took the Jerry West in this video and transported him suddenly to this league, he wouldn’t even be as good as Marcus Smart. Marcus Smart’s highlights and skills and more impressive than this"
Marcus smart best player in the world
Marcus is Smart
"Definitely that’s MORE impressive lmao, send a link for that it sounds crazy  But What I meant by that isnt “holy shit Marcus smart is soooo good that he gets a steal here, no one else in the league could strip some 5’8 civilian at summer camp”. I moreso meant it like “the casual athleticism and skill level of nba caliber players is terrifying”"
"Jalen green has hamstring tightness... so they are holding him out due to precaution because the GM said he has seen enough from him in summer league so he doesn’t want him to get injured... that’s literally  the report that came out... you are hella misinformed, not because he has an actual injury like a torn or sprained hamstring etc...   In the summer league you are still playing against former NBA players like Kenneth Faried, beasley, Mudiay etc, and second year players like immanuel quickley saddiq bey etc, so you are playing against NBA competition and it is NBA rules with 24 seconds on the shot clock and same type of referees, so it is def way more similar then a pointless pro am game with scrubs... as a 3rd string pg with schroder and Marcus smart starting over him he doesn’t have many errors to make and if I were him I’d be trying to play against the best competition possible, summer league is only like a week long then he has the rest of the offseason to do pro am, and there wasn’t a summer league last year either  Also to answer u when U said “so he can let other players below shine” why would he want a point guard below him shine and possibly get the coaches eye and take his spot? U don’t make any sense at all"
Yea that makes a lot of sense to play in pro am against scrubs rather then nba competition on the same exact day when you are the 3rd string point guard behind schroder and Marcus smart
"He has Dennis schroder and Marcus smart starting over him next season, he’s obviously not good enough, immanuel quickley is still playing in summer league lighting it up and getting better against NBA competition, so yea as a 3rd string PG he’s gonna play on the same exact day in a pointless pro am game then the nba summer league game with nba competition, doesn’t make any sense on how that’s helping him get better for next season, he’s the 3rd string point guard he needs all the nba game reps he can get"
"Wtf are u saying? They just held out Jalen green and cade Cunningham from summer league so they wouldn’t get injured, you are a straight clown... Why would he care about the point guard below him on the depth chart? There trying to take his spot also in the NBA also.. how does it make any sense at all that he’s gonna sit out of a game full of NBA competition so he won’t get injured, to go play on the same exact day and drop 92 points against scrubs like high schoolers and college players in a pointless pro am game, he has Dennis schroder and Marcus smart starting over him next season, and he doesn’t wanna get as much NBA reps and NBA game time that he can get? The experience you get in game is totally different from practice and even pointless pro am"
"Why would he care about the point guard below him on the depth chart?

The experience you get in game is totally different from practice and even pointless pro am"
"So he sits out of a NBA summer league game most likely to not get injured, to then go and play in a pro am game on the same exact day and drop 92? How does that make any sense, if I was an NBA player like Pritchard trying to make a name for myself and start next season over schroder and Marcus smart, id be trying to ply against as much NBA competition and get as much game reps as possible, immanuel quickley is still playing and he’s lighting it up"
Marcus Smart will win Defensive Player of the Year
This is the season Marcus Smart takes a Lowry-like late jump into All-Stardom.

Huh? He's gonna get more minutes over Ben Simmons than Marcus Smart at PG?
Marcus Smart is the best player in the NBA. There I said it
"Well considering Kemba is gone off the Celtics, and their two best players aren’t playmakers and struggle to make people around them better….. I think he will be the starting PG for the Celtics and make a very big impact. Marcus Smart blatantly cannot be their starting point guard."
"Who do you think starts, Marcus Smart or Dennis Schroeder? Do both start?"
"I think he's Marcus Smart meets OG Anunobye meets the ""football is life!"" guy from Ted Lasso. I love him so much. I wish he was on my team."
jae crowder booping wall  the failed funeral game  marcus smart marcus smarting  the miyah game  lots of personal classic moments
"**1. The Pacers are a franchise without direction, who would be better off selling their desirable assets right now (Brogdon, Sabonis, Turner) rather than meandering as they have been. While they have made “attempts”, first round picks are not their priority and it will be the death of their hopes for more than a first round exit. 2.	The Hawks are not a championship team, and will not be with Trae Young. To me he seems to be this era’s answer to Allen Iverson, but as with both their defense and dominance of the ball will ensure that they do not make that next step toward true contention. That being said, I respect everything they’ve accomplished this past year, and I respect Trae as a player. 3.	The Celtics are going to regret not finding a proper point guard, as after watching Marcus Smart I doubt he will be consistent enough on offense to keep them relevant. They’re going to end up winning about 44 games and losing in the first round. 4.	The Trail Blazers are going to trade Damian Lillard for a fringe all star, two first round picks, and two high level role players.**"
"2020 Raptors beat that lakers team if no pandemic. We had the bigs to guard AD (Gasol, Ibaka, Pascal) and the better guards. Pascal not playing bball for 3 months before the bubble destroyed us. I know it was the regular season but the 2020 Raptors smacked the 2020 Lakers twice in super convincing wins. Just a shame we lost to Marcus Smart turning into prime Ray Allen."
"I’ll go with players I think are completely overrated and number one is James harden. The only reason he has ever come close to the finals was because he finally got CP3 on his team, or he joined a team with two super stars already. If he wins a ring with Brooklyn it will be 10000% because of KD. All his scoring numbers are really pretty on paper but he’s just not for me.   Also this is hard coming from my own team but honestly Marcus smart is also overrated. Everyone talks about him being “the heart/soul of the team and oh how could you trade the heart and soul then the Celtics won’t have any!” If the heart of the team is STILL being dependent on Marcus smart, and nowhere else, then we got bigger problems.   Similarly this kills me because I also support the warriors, but same case, draymond is overrated and I think they should have traded him already like Marcus"
Agreed. It took me about 5 minutes of watching the Celtics to notice Tatum missing guys for wide open threes. At first I thought he was just annoyed at Marcus Smart and didn’t want to give him the ball but then he did to Kemba and Pritchard I think later in the quarter. The guy is a ball hog if we’re going to be straight up about it. He’s been the go to scorer basically his whole life and seems to have never developed the passing gene. I think if he’s willing to work off ball more as a shooter/cutter then I don’t know if it will matter assuming they get a decent PG later on.
I am completely fine with a player just exaggerating real contact. It's the Marcus smart flops that loss me off. He just launches himself into other players.
Young Marcus Smart.
Hopefully Marcus smart takes another leap as a pg
So you did see him hit his head? Are you 240 pounds and moving that quick? The dude said he was unconscious and he doesn't have a history of being a flopper like Marcus Smart or hell even Lebron. It seems like there's not a ton of reason not to believe him.
Marcus smart
"It was totally fine in the playoffs. He never got abused by other teams like people thought he would and even made some good plays when he was being posted up by big men including Giannis. Trae had a playoff defensive rating of 111.7 which is very much average.  Better defensive rating than... RJ Barret, KCP, Paul George, Kawhi, Rondo, RoCo, Jimmy Butler, Donovan Mitchell, and Marcus Smart. All of which have significantly higher defensive reputations."
Box score allowed you see the stats of a player whenever IT is guarding them? Lol. You probably just checked the opposing starting PG’s points per box score. How sure are you that it wasn’t because of Marcus Smart? How sure are you that IT wasn’t being hidden by Brad Stevens with some other offensive player who is not a threat just to hide IT. This is the problem. People don’t know how to interpret box scores.
He was your best player when he was healthy 2019-2020 but go off.  I’m sure marcus smart and Dennis the menace at PG are going to be great for you guys.
Look at who the best passers were on the last 5 championship teams. Now use your fucking brain and realise that they’re all significantly better playmakers than Smart. You can’t win titles if your best playmaker is Marcus Smart lmfao
"How many Chris Paul-type point guards are in the league right now, exactly? They don't fuckin' grow on trees. Besides, Marcus Smart *is* a pass-first point guard when we're using him like a lead ball-handler instead of an off-guard."
Josh Christopher is a menance on D  Getting Marcus smart vibes
Because we've had Marcus Smart on our roster for the last 5 years?
More like Marcus Smart
"Jrue, Donovan, Marcus Smart, Draymon all play bigger than their size  Porzingis plays much smaller than his size."
The most clever Smart joke I think I've seen in here   Usually: Marcus NOT smart
🎵Marcus Smart smart smart smart  Schroder Agent dumb  So Agent went on back to Schroder  Said the Lakers offered 84M to stay  Schroder got mad and told his Agent  He wanted additional pay  (Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb)🎵
Marcus Smart plays bigger.   Tatum plays smaller.
"&gt;I don't think the team is especially keen to move on from Marcus  They definitely aren't, but they also aren't keen on paying him over $20 million per year which is apparently what he wants. They didn't want to move on from Horford, Hayward or Fournier either, but they did when the offers those guys got were too much to match. I doubt they let themselves get put in the same position with Smart. If they think things are heading that way, now they know if they trade him they have someone to take his place."
Bigger: Marcus Smart  Smaller: Marcus Smart
Marcus “stretch 6” smart
Marcus Smart
"Marcus Smart defends like hes 6'10""  Dude can defend power forwards and most centers in the post, though not for extended periods of time."
Schroder is nowhere close to Marcus Smart level defense
I would not be surprised if the Celtics now feel like they're free to trade Marcus Smart if extension negotiations don't work out with him. Schroder and Pritchard could man the PG duties if they can get something of value for Smart. This was a good move for Boston.
How is Marcus smart going to start over Dennis Schroeder?
"It’s amazing, the defense between him and Marcus Smart will for real be scary"
Marcus Smart too
Joe Harris and Marcus Smart
"&gt;You know there’s two guard positions right? So Smart and Dennis could play at the same time.   What is the Celtics rotation going to look like? Is Jaylen Brown going to play almost exclusively small forward with Tatum playing almost exclusively power forward? I was under the impression those guys would probably be mainly the 2/3 combo for Boston, but I could be wrong. I think if you put Smart and Schroder out there together that's a dangerous lack of shooting from your guards, but maybe they make it work.   &gt; And they could both be playing hard af for a contract next year. So how would that be a bad thing?   Having just watched a Lakers team that had a bunch of guys angling for free agency, I will say that guys playing hard for a contract does not necessarily mean they're doing what the team needs them to do. If one of Smart or Schroder feels like they're not getting enough minutes or touches, it could lead to poor chemistry with so much money on the line. That could be a lot for a first time coach to be trying to navigate.   &gt; Dennis played with LeBron, a ball dominant player who is basically a point guard, and still almost got that huge contract.  I don't know how close Schroder was this summer to getting a big contract. The Lakers offered him a big one back in February, but that was mainly because they had traded Danny Green and a 1st for him and didn't want him to just end up walking like he's going to. The Lakers were in a position where it was OK to overpay him to keep him, especially because LeBron has for years been looking for someone else to take over many of his ball handling duties. The Lakers also were going to be over the cap either way, so the money wasn't as much of an issue.  &gt;Also, I could totally see a rebuilding team sign him for 20m/yr  You shouldn't look at it like some stupid team will make a mistake and give Schroder a lot of money, you should look at it like if *your* team was bad and rebuilding, how happy would you be if their big splash in free agency was offering Schroder $20 million in cap space. Personally I don't think that market is going to be there for him. It wasn't even close to being there for him this summer, and that's after a year starting for a team. Having to share minutes with a couple other guards probably won't showcase him to the point where another team makes him a big offer. My guess is if he signs the MLE this summer, he'll be doing the same somewhere else next summer.   The only exception I'd make to this is if the Celtics really are planning on trading Marcus Smart as has been rumored a couple times. If they do that, then Schroder might be able to showcase himself to get something decent in free agency next summer. Not $20 million per year, but maybe $10-15 million."
Marcus Smart and IT
"Agreed completely. If he couldn't demonstrate to other teams this summer that he was worth big money after being the Lakers starter this year then how is he going to convince teams to throw money at him next year coming off the bench behind Marcus Smart (another guy who is looking for a big payday next summer)? Also, when the Celtics are hoping to groom Payton Pritchard for some bigger role in the years to come, are they really going to just give all his minutes to Schroder so he can showcase himself for a contract with another team next year?  This was Schroder's big chance and he blew it. The Lakers had his Bird rights and a need at point guard. He didn't need to worry if other team's had cap space cause the Lakers could exceed the cap to bring him back. If he goes to Boston as the 2nd or 3rd string PG, he won't get to showcase himself much, and he'll be back out there next year hoping someone uses cap space to sign him, or else it'll be just another MLE deal again. He had a golden opportunity to get paid and he threw it away. That's never coming back."
Marcus Smart and Jaylen Brown are both up there.
"Marcus Smart, It’s why he’s always included in trade rumors."
Don’t forget his best acting job to date when he race baited Stu Scott and the rest of the media offsides when he made up a Texas Tech fan saying something racist to explain why he punched the fan. Marcus Smart is a piece of crap.
Marcus Smart knows all about magikarping
Tall Marcus Smart
"Celtics would be pretty great with Prime Rondo, Brown/Pierce/Tatum and KG with Ray Allen, Marcus Smart coming off the bench.   Lakers still take it with Kobe and Lebron but that would be an awesome series IMO."
"As a fan of Marcus Smart, this all looks completely normal and legit to me..."
Marcus Smart announces his retirement.
They’ll do Marcus Smart for the 7th  ^(really though the Celtics are interviewing all the top-10 guys even though all they have is a second round pick)
"I know, and that's what Pat Bev is mocking. Marcus Smart does the same thing all the time and nearly breaks his tailbone flailing like a fish lol"
Marcus smart
CP3 going full Marcus Smart out there
Marcus smart similarly punched a picture frame  and injured his hand after a loss to the Lakers a few years ago
"Well example for Dame- Celtics:Jaylen Brown,Marcus Smart and a future first round pick.   The examples for Simmons are like I was saying, the Wiggins trades, DeMar DeRozan, those level of players, I’ll admit the Ben Simmons hate is extreme but I feel like Portland isn’t going to pull the trigger on a trade, and I feel like the 76ers are going to panic trade so they don’t feel like they have another Lowery and Harden situation and are going to go full do or die for a championship.  It’s not me saying a Lillard for Simmons trade would never happen but I feel like Portland isn’t truly shopping Lillard…yet, and more realistically teams are offering weaker packages after the playoffs this year."
Doesn't matter still beat Bron.  Lol that is hilarious though. Shades of Marcus smart this hear
"No.  They're currently right at the cap number with 12 on the roster.  If they renounce their upcoming free agents (namely Fournier), they'll have about 8m to work with under the luxury tax.  They can use part of the non tax mle, sign their 2nd round pick and sign a minimum contract (Tacko pls) in that space to get to 15.  &amp;#x200B;  The only flaw to that plan is they would not be able to sign a point guard and Marcus Smart would be it, although Tatum might be pushed into a Lebron-like role in that case.  Either way they can only sign a pg to the mle, but one worth 9m is probably better than one worth 6m.    &amp;#x200B;  Otherwise they could try and make trades with either Horford or Thompson as they currently have 4 centers on their 12 man.  And if they re-sign Fournier with bird rights, they'll be well over the tax, and the only way to drop under would be trading Horford into another team's cap space."
"That's true, I think he is worth significantly more than a minimum and that sounds about right. Looking at contracts it does get a little harder justifying paying a premium for such niche situations when at that price you can get quality role players like Marcus Smart, Danny Green, Dejounte Murray, Christian Wood. Granted some of those players are team friendly contracts but still."
"Fan vote is for the starters. The coaches and media aren't picking him for reserves either. I've never seen an article talking about how CJ McCollum was an all star snub.   You're correct , it is my opinion at the end of the day. Do you really think late career Kobe was a top 10 defender when he's making those teams?  I really don't think Marcus Smart , Klay Thompson, and Eric Bledsoe are top 10 defenders either. As well, you're discounting that all defence is a regular season award. That raptors team was built for the highest levels of playoff defence which is almost a completely different game. E.g. DPOY Gobert is not holding up in that series."
Marcus Smart 🤣
"It was such a weird thing to say, like not saying he is a racist, but just fucking dumb and tone deaf. At that stage he knew he was gone in a few weeks before that was announced, but why did he say that? Sure a lot of players came to Boston and had a good time, notably Big Baby and Perk talked about that, but to say no one encountered racism during his GM time is strange given that Marcus Smart spoke public ally about getting racist shit yelled at him after a game in a car park, and probably many more other incidences that would have been raised with him or in the media.   It was like a dumb shot on his way out, like he was just flipping off these concerns as he prepared to leave the team and the state."
"Not talking about the organisation itself, more the home town fans.  Bill Russell in particular experienced horrible racism by Boston fans but it has still continued to happen with Kevin Garnett, Marcus Smart etc"
"While not being racist necessarily, his actions don’t exactly scream ally aka he is complicit with the racism. Mostly claiming that he’s never heard any of the players in the Celtics complain about racism in his 26 years. Which is directly contradictory to what Marcus Smart and others have said within the media"
"He’s a solid piece for tradable assets, but yeah they would have to throw in so many more picks. And probably Marcus smart"
"The Kyrie/harden/KD trio played like 5 games together due to injuries and they will all be a year older next year. Not really that terrified of a bunch of injury-prone players, especially when one of them is Kyrie.  If this GM maintains a worse roster for two seasons just for the end-goal of having a max contract slot available, then he's an idiot. To get to a max contract opening requires letting Fournier go and then not re-signing Marcus Smart after next year. And then what? You hope to sign Brad Beal?"
Marcus Smart until he extends his contract
"Jerami Grant $19,047,000  Marcus Smart $13,446,000  Christian Wood $13,015,000  Spencer Dinwiddie $11,454,000  DeAndre Hunter $7,422,000  Succeeding is all relative obviously when you make the rule no all stars you can the ceiling at 5-6 seed type range."
"Yes. Marcus Smart. I've been saying this all season, Smart is *not* a 2, and Smart-at-PG lineups have been consistently some of our best over the last few seasons, partially because of the defense and partially because he's actually a really good passer when given the opportunity. Part of the reason he *takes* those stupid shots is that we haven't been consistently putting him in the role of primary distributor. With Tatum and Brown taking over more of the ball-handling duties, and with the Horford trade giving us multiple bigs who can pass, I'm not too worried about having an off-ball guy like Pritchard as our primary backup PG."
"#Perfect offseason  Tatum recruits Bradley Beal during the olympics, he requests a trade to Boston and we trade Tristan Thompson, Marcus Smart, Robert Williams, and a decade of picks and swaps for him  #Realistic offseason   Re-sign Fournier to a 3 year deal around 40-45m   Trade for a good starting PG like Derrick White or Ricky Rubio  Agree to a cheap extension for Timelord"
"""Marcus Smart with the great defense on Booker!"""
Marcus Smart is amazing at it. Like he hits it every time. No idea how.
"No one is saying that playing defense or fouling makes someone dirty. But Bev has a history of making dirty plays. No one calls Holiday, Simmons, or Marcus smart dirty players. Bev has a history of being a guy that hurts guys and takes cheap shots, hence why he is called dirty. Thank you for coming to my Ted talk."
"The problem is that all the high usage players were terrible passers. Brown is a bottom tier playmaker for others, Kemba is bad for a PG, Tatum is a bad, but improving passer. The rest of the roster is incapable of self-creation outside of Payton Pritchard. Marcus Smart was the best passer on the roster and he's not a real threat in the half court because he can't finish inside and his outside shot is terrible.  Rob Williams is a tremendous passer, but he plays like 15 minutes a game between injuries.   So basically it's just a dribble handoff offense without anyone who can create for others in the half court. Just give it to Brown or Tatum and hope they can hit a midrange garbage shot. And sometimes it worked because those guys are so skilled. But it was always ugly, and usually not effective."
"If anything the Celtics are our most recent rivals, IMO. We went 7-1 in the bubble, losing only to them in a blowout. And then they stopped us from getting back to the ECF and possibly the finals.  Hence Marcus Smart being our second most upvoted choice, those 5 fucking threes he hit in the 4th were gutting."
"&gt;	Dame is out. Enjoy watching Marcus Smart, Romeo Langford &amp; Carsen Edwards the next 2 seasons  I agree"
"Lmao this roster is night and day from the 2019 roster! That roster featured a bunch of role players and borderline all-stars. They only had two real “stars” with Tatum and Mitchell. This year they are already led by Durant and Lillard, then Beal/Tatum/Booker as clear stars, and finally the rest of the guys are at least borderline all-star players. Definitely not the strongest team fielded but way stronger than whatever the hell it was they put together in 2019. I mean that team had Marcus Smart, Brooke Lopez, Joe Harris, and fucking Mason Plumlee! I don’t know how you could even compare this year’s roster to that other team."
Lol you literally have Marcus Smart on your team.
"Eh. Depends on what you mean by valuable. Does he come into the game and do good stuff for us? Yes. Does he do anything particularly well that an average player wouldn’t be able to replicate? No.   So all in all he’s a valuable plug player because he does help, but not irreplaceable valuable (sort of like a Marcus smart)"
Marcus not smart
"Marcus Smart is anything but low IQ.  He’s as high IQ as it gets, just think they’d be better served if he shoots less from 3"
"Someone needs to show Marcus Smart this quote.  Our fanbase likes to call Smart a light Guard version of Draymond.  I mean, yeah. He is a guard version of Draymond, with not nearly good enough defense, and quite possibly the worst instincts and lowest game IQ in the entire league."
And with that you have to be halfway out of your mind to willingly get trucked over by a driving Giannis...terrifies &amp; amazes me everytime Marcus Smart does it lol
"I know people thought tommy was biased (and he absolutely was) but I feel like it was in a kind of endearing oldhead way. Like marcus smart could sucker punch someone in the face and Tommy would be absolutely flabbergasted as to where the foul occurred. Meanwhile scal is just really bitter and grumpy, plus he’s constantly a dick to our sideline reporter for no reason"
"Yes, to the Celtics for Tristan Thompson and Marcus Smart. Twist my arm and we'll throw in Grant Williams."
Marcus smart was a terrible fucking shooter for his first 4 years in the league and he just kept shooting and it actually helped the team a lot because teams mysteriously wouldn't just sag off him even though he was close to historically bad at it. Now he's a pretty serviceable but incredibly inconsistent shooter.
"Ok, so enforce 100% carry violations. Enforce 100% of lane violations. Call a foul on any illegal contact no matter how slight, even in the playoffs. Man I can’t wait to watch your version of the nba. Just kidding, that’s fucking garbage. Imagine if they actually enacted the flopping rules. Marcus smart would be suspended for the entire year. Just try to understand that the rules are better when there’s a little wiggle room for a better experience.    Giannis isn’t taking 17 seconds, the post says the hawks clock him between 11-13. Man that’s 1-3 extra seconds of free throw time per, which adds maybe a minute to the game. There’s nothing against the rules about wasting time before the refs give you the ball. It’s just such a weird ticky tack thing for neutrals to complain about."
"You really think a guy like Marcus Smart could wave off getting the ball from the ref to do his preball routine, and then routinely take 13+ seconds to shoot?  Giannis gets away with it because he's a superstar and they get away with shit other guys can't do."
I agree. There are millions of people watching these games. How is the league not embarrassed having their own rules so blatantly ignored? I wish another player would start mirroring Giannis's routine. If Marcus Smart started doing this shit the league would ship him to Shanghai
I am of the mind that if you trade CJ and Marcus Smart is the best player that comes back you will only make Dame angrier.
Who the fuck trades CJ for fucking Marcus Smart lmao
Lol no. McCollum isn’t even worth Marcus Smart. Just look at their playoff resumes. We’ll take Dame though.
"I mean Damian Lillard, Danilo Gallinari, Marcus Smart, Buddy Hield, there are some decent players on here."
Liked him on the Jazz. But also here is a list of #6 picks from all drafts that currently still have an active player:  Onyeka Okongwu  Jarrett Culver  Mo Bamba  Jonathan Isaac  Buddy Hield  Willie Cauley-Stein  Marcus Smart  Nerlens Noel  Damian Lillard  Jan Vesely  Ekpe Udoh  Jonny Flynn  Danilo Gallinari  Yi Jianlian  Brandon Roy  Martell Webster  Josh Childress  Chris Kaman  Dajuan Wagner
Marcus Smart doesn’t win you a ring.
"Here’s the thing, the Celtics also want to win big. They won’t trade Brown or Tatum for McCollum who is a worse player. If POR wants to get better, the Celtics make no sense. Picks and or some young guys to develop won’t do anything for them, except make them worse in the now. Edit: I didn’t really think about Marcus Smart. I don’t think that makes Portland better, just different."
"I am sure Dame isn’t advocating for a downgrade to Marcus smart. The only way CJ moves is for a SF that someone can make make an argument for. The only thing Portland has going for it is guard depth. If CJ is out it won’t be to bring another guard back. And I’m guessing Boston doesn’t want CJ, little or Simons or Collins, and two firsts for one of Brown or Tatum. So I’m not sure who is the source behind this but it’s not someone reasonable, if there even is a source and it’s not just wild conjecture."
Marcus Smart?  Really???
[Udoka every time Marcus Smart takes an off-the-dribble 3 with 18 on the shot clock](https://tenor.com/HrBt.gif)
Ah yes the total control the Celtics have on the media. The centerpiece to a win now move for portland is clearly marcus smart........If your not gettin Brown that trade aint happening.
Why not just trade for Ben Simmons then? Don't really see what a Marcus Smart trade accomplishes.
"I'll never forget that Millsap game because he was absolutely dominating us until Marcus Smart started guarding him, after which Millsap went 1-5 and the Celtics won."
"All the talk's been about Pritchard and Timelord, but Nesmith was lowkey really solid once he started getting consistent minutes. We all knew he could shoot, but he's been showing Marcus Smart-esque levels of grit and hustle on defense. I'm not gonna go crazy overboard on his potential, but I think he could be a really solid 3&amp;D role-player going forward, with room still to grow."
"Yeah, the comments in this fucking thread are dumb lmao.   Marcus Smart is a hustle player too but this sub thinks he’s valuable (he is)."
"I think that racism can manifest in many different ways. For example, segregation. If you look at the racial breakdown of neighborhoods, and correlate that to aggregate family wealth, the numbers are staggering. Also, Boston is a very cliquey place. This creates a division of social circles, which exacerbates the issue of segregation, as it goes from where you live to who you associate with. A lot of Boston is made up of moderately wealthy young adults, and the suburbs are a lot of older-thinking townies who are your classic racists: the n word saying people who don’t like interracial relationships. Those people tend to be the ones at games, ergo the behavior exhibited at times (see Marcus Smart). I can bet you a million bucks the lady who called Marcus the n word was a suburban dwelling, moderately wealthy person. The racist behaviors in Boston are so meshed with class/wealth/social status, that the overt nature of racism doesn’t need to be displayed in order for it to have an effect on Bostonians of color.   You’re right: every major city in the US has these same issues. And Boston shouldn’t be held up as the only place who has these issues, but it’s always important to point out. I think Jaylen had the best comments about this when asked after Kyrie’s dig:  https://www.celticsblog.com/2021/5/28/22459234/jaylen-brown-boston-celtics-brooklyn-nets-kyrie-irving-marcus-smart-danny-ainge-racism  A lot of this “Boston is so racist!” Stuff ends up diluting the actual conversation, because it gets into a back and forth about who lives in a more racist place, which is absolutely bizarre."
14 for Marcus smart
Well Boston still has the major business this summer of negotiating to try to get Fournier to re-sign and also their extension talks with Marcus Smart and Robert Williams. The off-season hasn't started yet so clearly Boston isn't done.
"I can say, I've watched many years of Marcus Smart, an elite defender and a true gamer, struggle to defend at peak condition when running the offense on the other end, which I suspect is Mitchell's issue"
That gets 30m a year.  He makes 8m a year more than Draymond Green who is basically your best case scenario if he improves.  RoCo makes 13m a year and is less limited on offense.  Patrick Beverly and Marcus Smart are in the same neighborhood.  Without improvement on offense his contract is like a 15m a year overpay to going rate.a for 4 years.  Which is getting into attach a first round pick to get rid of range.
With all due respect... The only right choice for the Raptors is Marcus Smart lol
"I don’t think you know how dbpm is calculated. It’s actually really complex. It’s not just plus minus. DBPM relies heavily on blocks, steals, and rebounds. That’s why elite perimeter defenders like Marcus smart have a negative dbpm. They don’t get much rebounds or blocks. Actually a really good example is lu Dort. He moves his feet so well and he makes the offense really uncomfortable. He exhausts his energy on that so he doesn’t get much steals, rebounds, or blocks. However, that doesn’t show up on dbpm bc it’s not recorded so it states that he’s a below average defender. Same goes for Wiggins. Although he’s a good shot blocker, the reason why ppl praise his defense is bc he’s so good at bothering and forcing the offense to take tough shots. That’s why dbpm is a bad stat"
"Nick Nurse is signal handedly one of the worst coaches we've ever had.  Close 2nd round series last year he made as much adjustments to the Marcus Smart pnr and the Tatum dribble hand off plays as Doc Rivers did against the Hawks Pin down / screen and shoot offense. He wore green (opposite teams color) in that 2020 playoff series which tricked Tatum to throwing the ball out of bounds...I've never seen that in sports at any level not to mention Brad Stevens undressed him by locking us down on defense and we couldn't stop that offense.  You want me to talk about the 20-21 season? How about Siakam post ups for the second year in a row?  He's doing to Siakam what doc Rivers did to Rondo (last year in Boston) Paul George, Josh Smith and his latest victim Ben Simmons.    Oh lemme guess ""coaches don't play"" that's absolutely false.  There's 100 plays in an average NBA play book and He Drew All Of Them Up!  If they don't work or better yet you get a rare gem of a player who knows how to ball and continues to improve (Siakam) year after year.  What happened next?  Nick Nurse the Preacher cusses his team like dogs, draws up failing plays, and forces guys minutes off the bench to basically nothing and then they don't play well.  How many more season do we have to give to the Reverse Steve Kerr ? He's terri-fucking-bull!"
"&gt;Robert Williams III, Marcus Smart, Aaron Nesmith, and a 2023 FRP.  This is not enough for the #10 pick, much less the #1 pick."
"With that being said. Robert Williams III, Marcus Smart, Aaron Nesmith, and a 2023 FRP. If it’s not enough for the first pick than I don’t want the first pick.   lol"
"&gt; Robert Williams III, Marcus Smart, Aaron Nesmith, and a 2023 FRP.   Keep this delusional shit in the team sub."
"Stares directly at Marcus Smart, Draymond Green, and Robert Covington"
"Horford playing at whatever level is better than Kemba on the bench every playoffs.  Addition by subtraction is the wrong term for it, but him constantly being unavailable when we need him is as much a waste of a max contact slot as you can get. It's better to spend that money on a big man that will more likely be available and that already has good chemistry with the team.  I think Kemba isn't shit, but he isn't as good as his numbers indicate. He was only really good for about a month, during which he embraced playmaking and opening the floor up for others, but also got his buckets in a relatively efficient manner. Beyond that, 55%TS is nothing to be proud of lol, his efficiency was wank for most of the season, and it was even worse in the playoffs (same as last season).. Jaylen Brown has a higher efficiency despite taking more shots, and more difficult shots, and struggling to clear 75% from the free throw line. Shit, Marcus smart is one of the most notoriously inefficient guys in the league and he constantly gets clowned for it but he's like a 53%TS, just slightly lower than Kemba."
Somewhere Marcus Smart is really chuffed looking at how Pat Bev is winning this game
Game winning dirt bag play by Pat Bev. I know Marcus Smart is proud somewhere
"Defensive is best portrayed through eye test, not stats. Statistically, sabonis is a better defender than embiid since sabonis has a DBPM of 1.5 compared to embiid’s 1.0. If you watch games tho, you’d know that that is far from the case. Embiid is an elite defender while sabonis is a traffic cone. There’s so many good defenders that are net negative on DBPM as well, not just Wiggins. Marcus smart, Paul George, lu Dort, Dillon brooks, and capela are all net negatives according to DBPM. Now if you just look at stats, this would make you think that montrezl harrell, who is a positive on DBPM, is a better defender than all of them. Well, that is false. This is why you need to watch games and not just rely on stats"

"Yeah he’s a terrible GM. Selecting trash players like Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Robert Williams, Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Payton Pritchard, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, Grant Williams, Avery Bradley, etc.  What a stupid comment"
"Yeah, what a dumbass ending up with Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown, and Jayson Tatum"
Smarter than marcus smart.
and it never worked.  you are thinking of when they said they would start fining for flopping. they threw a few fines at people like marcus smart and rondo and the like and then just forgot to keep monitoring it. people still flop all over the place
You've had Marcus Smart an actual elite defender for years. If you think Bradley was anywhere close to that level then let's just agree to disagree on that
"""Hey remember like three days ago where you flopped in that game? Yeah, don't do that again.""  [They fined one guy this last season - Marcus Smart. And that was it.](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/fines-suspensions/)"
"the bigger problem with smart is that he's a microwave shooter. he can get hot really fast, and is a league avg shooter now not a bad one like his rookie season. as evidenced by watching games, notably Toronto last year, can't leave Marcus open."
"While I appreciate the sentiment… one of my bigger problems with brad is that he goes so far out of his way to not react/discipline/interject that it’s a detriment IMO.   Doesn’t use timeouts to stop the bleeding when we are in a huge funk and the other team is on a run… to which the hole usually ends up much bigger than it probably would have if he called one.  Doesn’t really run and offense and has created a culture where people like Marcus smart and other role players in the past  feel empowered to take 15-20 shots a game at a terrible efficiency without seeing anything wrong with it while our stars just run around looking lost.   Doesn’t really seem to be a motivator in any way.  I’m very squarely a millennial and not some weird middle aged man with a fetish for tough coaching and this idea of abusive behavior, but it’s like he’s so afraid of doing anything or saying anything that it’s actually a net negative. Some players are stable enough to receive some critical coaching and motivation sometimes. Not everyone is fragile and will become a total head case like brad thinks they will because he hated being coached tough and it would get into his head.   I love supportive players coaches a lot, but brad takes it to a level where I feel like the C’s will never make that jump because he’s so passive."
"You can have more talented players and DJ could still be the soul of the team. Like I don't think Kawhi is the ""soul"" of the Clippers, but he's obviously their best player. Marcus Smart was the ""soul"" of those good Celtic teams and he was consistently like their 4th best player at best. Every team needs that guy who can be the vocal and emotional leader of the team, doesn't always have to be the teams best player."
Even Marcus Smart creates spacing despite struggling to crack 35% from three because he’s not afraid to take the shot. His volume of attempts mitigates some of his shooting percentage.
"Nope. He had Horford his rookie year and none of them when he made it last year. He did have Kemba but Kemba got injured midway through.  His rookie year was actually really crazy. Not only were Kyrie and Hayward out, but so was Theis. Marcus Smart was out for the first four games after a bad thumb injury that needed surgery and clearly affected his shot once he was back. Jaylen Brown tore his hamstring game 7 vs the Bucks and missed the first sixers game before being on a minutes restriction off the bench until the fifth and final game of the series.  What that meant was we had a starting lineup of Terry/Tatum/Horford with either Jaylen or Smart and one of Baynes/Morris/Semi. The others came off the bench along with Shane Larkin who was averaging 14 minutes a game and Greg Monroe with a bit less than 10."
Actually that numb nut Hinkie wanted to draft Marcus Smart instead of Embiid and was thankfully talked out of it by scouting staff. Sam was an abysmal failure and will never get a sniff at another NBA job.
"Marcus Smart is an elite roleplayer.  In actuality, he's a very inconsistent impulsive player who lacks discipline. He's a player who's intangibles often lead to bad decision making on offense and contributes to loosing as often as winning.   Unless a team has a coach who can reel him in, he's likely to hurt any team that isn't a contender and can force him into a specific role.  And it's been reported players have been frustrated with Steven's favoritism of Smart."
"Figure out how to get Embiid both Marcus Smart and Patrick Beverley and you will see real quick they don't need a top scoring PG. They just need a guy with heart. But in my example, 2 of the hardest working defensive pain in the ass bulldogs, too."
Marcus Smart with Steph Curry scoring and Chris Paul’s playmaking. Best point guard in the league lol
"I’ve seen a huge decline in flopping, remember just a few years ago when Marcus smart was mimicking a salmon out of water on every fucking play? Also, I just noticed in euro 2020 that the umpires are handing out yellow cards for “simulation” which is a flop. I fucking love this so hopefully the league addresses this. They kind of did with the removal of the rip through shooting foul (a la kobe) and also the jumping into the defender although this still slips through the cracks fairly often"
Marcus Smart with Curry’s shooting and CP3’s leadership
"Little known fact, a lot of Philly fans secretly love Marcus Smart. Or at least I do."
"5 pts (2-4) 13 assists/2 turnovers 8 rebounds +1 in 36 min  literally the only ""bad"" thing was the fact that he only shot the ball 4 times... but that's like getting mad at Rudy Gobert or Marcus Smart for not taking more shots- that's not his role, he's an ace defender and a ball-handler/playmaker not a scorer  nice try tho"
We will give Philly Marcus smart and a pick for simmons
This is Donovan Mitchell not Marcus Smart /s
"All I said was that it would be in their right to want to leave. Who knows what could happen 3 years from now. The other guy said that they don't deserve us as fans if they left for another team. I mentioned that it's completely okay for them to want out after a few more years. And neither one of us is talking about this off-season. How many people lack intelligence and reading comprehension on this site? Goodness, actually make sure you understood what you just read. Clearly talking about a few years into the future.  And stop overrating the ""help."" Kemba benefitted from a weak East to make the All-Star game multiple times. He's starting to wash up, is inefficient, and is useless if he can't put the ball in the basket, and he's too small. Marcus Smart has offensive flaws and his defense has regressed this year, preinjury as well. We'll see if he can be All-Defense again next season. He also plays out of control a bunch and his flopping hurts us at times. Fournier can be a good 6th man, but it's not like he's anything special and he doesn't give us great defense that we lack right now. He needs to be a consistent, efficient scorer to be a positive impact, and I'm also not excited about what it may cost to keep him in the off-season. People keep talking about Kemba coming back, but he's been back a while now, but he's permanently hurt in his knee and y'all keep ""forgetting"" to mention that.  Lineups that have title potential aren't below .500 Teams just because a couple of guys missed a few games. Smart was the only one out for a significant amount of time. Real teams that have title potential can maintain a decent record while 1 or 2 key guys are out. We are below .500 and the whole time missed stat is different when you look at context. A lot of that missed time goes to Langford being out all year (no surprise with him), Thompson going into protocol multiple times because he supposedly parties too much, Smart's injury, and Kemba not playing SNB2B (because bad knee). The team still should have been able to maintain an over .500 record. But they haven't, and they look poor on both ends with their top guys all on the floor.  Harden, KD, and Westbrook actually made the Finals together at a similar age range as the Jays are now. That was 3 top guys who stayed together after already making a Finals, and had Serge too. Not an equal comparison. PG got out during his prime years to ring chase and has been on 2 different teams now. LeBron made the Finals at least, but he left to go join a stronger team in his prime years. Melo got out in his prime years, but went to a team that didn't do a good job of building. Lillard is the only one who has been super loyal, and you see where that's gotten him in terms of a title. Embiid and Simmons are a great duo, and their team is a true title contender with them healthy. And there was constant proposals of breaking them up last season, and there were trade rumors of trading Simmons for Harden THIS SEASON!  All your examples support what I originally said. That JB and JT could want out for their PRIME years like I typed out clear to see just like LeBron, PG, KD, etc. Kobe once demanded a trade, and that was after multiple titles. KG wanted out while he still had good years. Kawhi wanted to spend his prime years outside of SA after a title. Demarcus Cousins asked out. Kyrie asked out of Cleveland to spend his prime years trying to win instead of rebuilding since LeBron was leaving. The difference with these guys outside of Cousins, and the ones you mentioned, is that their GMs made moves to strengthen their teams, and made moves again to stay strong if one didn't work out. Danny got Kyrie, but it was a mess. And instead of getting stronger, he built a weaker team talent wise, and that team has gotten even weaker this season, and it just may get weaker or stay the same after this coming off-season. So thanks for all of this BS rambling when everything supports what I said originally. That the Jays might want out to chase a ring when their prime years start. Good job guys and thanks for the downvotes because you can't read and understand a situation. And good job with the supporting evidence that the Jays might want out when they get to that age 26-27 range to go try and win a ring elsewhere if we end up still having a mediocre team by then, that helped my argument."
"Everyone is so quick to jump the gun and be worried about losing Tatum and Brown, when they are 23 and 24. Is Miami going to be worried about losing Bam if they lose in the first or second round this year? Is Sacramento worried about losing De'Aaron Fox since he was also just signed to a 5-year max and they can't put help around him? Is Ben Simmons going to demand a trade if they don't make the finals yet again? Same for Donovan Mitchell if the Jazz don't win this year? What about Sabonis or Devin Booker?  All of these guys are the same ages as Tatum/Brown, but I never hear this narrative about them, except maybe Simmons in trade rumors, and they all haven't won a championship yet either.  Everyone said the same thing about Giannis and then he stayed in Milwaukee. I understand where it comes from when it does happen and guys want out, I just don't know what kind of power they have with 3/4 years left on $24M+ deals where any trade to match salary would send them to a bad team or a contender would be losing key pieces to match salary and they'd be in the exact same spot in a different location. Celtics aren't buying them out lol.  They have literally no leverage to demand a trade this offseason and if you make the playoffs 4 years in a row and made it to the ECF in 2/4 of those where you're the main guy(s), why would you want out that bad?  James Harden spent 8 years in Houston. KD spent 9 in OKC. LeBron stuck it out with the Cavs for 7. Paul George in Indiana for 7. AD with the Pelicans for 7. Melo with Denver for 7.5. Lillard has spent his entire career with Portland. Embiid has played 5 season with the Sixers and there's no mention of him jumping ship. Jokic 6 years in Denver and no one is saying he's going to demand a trade. None of these guys won championships with those teams.  Why does everyone act like their window is closed now or very soon after just 4 years when people act like their help (Kemba Walker, 4 time All-Star, coming back from injury/surgery. Marcus Smart, 1st team All Defense, coming back from injury. Evan Fournier, 18 PPG scoring option, 2 games in) is no help at all? This narrative is nonsense."
Josh Hart is better than Marcus Smart
"Marcus Smart. Also, use correct formatting please.  The flopping king.  Ooh  You can fall  You can dive  Having the time of your life  Ooh, see that man  Watch that scene  flying the flopping queen  Friday night and the lights are bright  Looking out for a place to fall  Where they play the right way  Getting in the swing  You come to look for a king  Anybody could be that guy  Night is young and the tensions high  With a bit of rap music  Everything is fine  You're in the mood for a flop  And when you get the chance  You are the flopping king  Old and spry  Only year seventeen  Flopping king  Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah  You can fall  You can dive  Having the time of your life  Ooh, see that man  Watch that scene  flying the flopping king  You're a teaser, you turn 'em refs on  Leave 'em burning and then you're gone  Looking out for another…"
"Beautiful, just need to find a way to work Marcus Smart into the lyrics"
Wow even Eric Bledsoe huh  Tatum had kyrie irving/Marcus Morris/Marcus smart/al horford/jaylen brown and couldn’t even get out the second round
"Yes, she also ended up being cussed out by everyone surrounding her with everyone defending Marcus Smart."
Didn’t Marcus Smart once get yelled at by a woman who called him a racial slur? Not to mention he was pulling out of the TD Garden parking lot and she was with her kid
"To be fair to the Celtics, signing Kemba looked good, but the loss of Hayward has hurt them so much more than they could've anticipated. Hayward as a 4th option is a contending team 100%. Kemba comes back from an injury and now he's looking to be on the down swing. JT and JB are both excellent but not doing the Myles Turner trade is really starting to bite the Celtics. Like if this squad had Myles Turner as a big and Daniel Theis as a backup still with their core 3 and Marcus Smart (Dumb), they'd probably be looking really good right now considering how amazing Myles Turner has been this season.   The most alarming thing for Boston though is how bad they are in the 4th quarter, like this is a team that is bottom 5 in the league in the 4th quarter. Whatever happened to their ability to close out games makes 0 sense."
"Really?  Brad Stevens, ""a top 5 coach in the league"".  Tatum, Brown, two ""All-Stars"".  Marcus ""heart and soul of the team"" Smart.  Kemba Walker, who has been averaging 20/3.5/5 after his first ten games.  Payton Pritchard and Rob Williams, two promising young players.  Evan Fournier, a 19/3/4 guy replaced Daniel Theis, another solid player.  That's seven average to ""elite"" players with an ""elite"" head coach.  Maybe not a contending roster but that's more than enough to get to the Playoffs.  When will people finally wake up and start questioning Tatum, Brown, and Brad Stevens?"
"I don’t know man. Giannis for some reason struggles more with FVV, Chris Paul, and Marcus Smart than he does with AD, Gobert, Turner, or Embiid"

marcus smart has zero value in the nba. this is commonly known amongst those on the inside  r e a l i t y
"I believe KG and Deandre Jordan have both had blocks like that for people who've never seen it before. Marcus smart has done this too but doesn't look as impressive.   This is a good one for sure, but is mainly due to a tough pass by Booker and Ayton being behind the ball. Bit of a mishap on their end led to this being within Pats reach."
"If we can get value for the salary, sure, but his position isn't our weakness. Marcus Smart is not a starting point guard. If we get Kemba we need a point guard.    The jays don't need a playmaker, they can both make their own plays. They need a complementary piece who will make them better, but both of them being mid-20ppg players suggests they don't need a playmaking point guard. They need someone to take pressure off them. Kemba is that, for multitude of reasons."
"Part of it is you gotta have the personnel. JB, JT, &amp; Marcus Smart are all good on ball defenders"
Thread your Marcus Smart pun here
Marcus Smart single handedly turned this game around with his defense on Luka in the second half. If the Celtics could shoot they would have won. Mavs holding the ball at half court for 20 seconds and heaving up 34 footers or getting shot clock violations all half.
Marcus Smart is on the floor lmaooo
"Another great shooting performance by Turdboy Marcus Smart. What a bum. Stop shooting, you idiot."
Where’s LeMickey Lame Time ADisney and Marcus Smart
CP3  Marcus Smart  Kawhi Leonard  Anthony Davis  Nikola Jokic  This team is winning at least 2 championships
Yeah last night was an ex of when he didnt really give a shit about playing defense it does happen. Ive also kind of just learned over time with perimeter defenders this happens with everybody there being reg season nights they just dont bring it see it with someone like a Marcus Smart.  Off ball he's never going to have Draymond esque defensive recognition instincts which is part of why I dont think he's DPOY caliber. Other thing is getting over screens which can be tough at 6'11. I also dont really trust guys like Dwight Howard and Mike Scott to be calling out where and when the screen is coming properly which matters lately.
You should watch Marcus Smart buddy. He will shoot us out of games.
So Marcus smart?
Marcus Smart
"Ah good point, I was mostly thinking about who the offense flows through but Jokic does play more like a big man in the Nuggets' sets (setting screens/picks, positioning for post-ups, etc.). And come to think of it I consider guys like Fred Vanvleet and Marcus Smart to be PGs even though primarily play alongside another PG."
"I basically got run off realgm for taking this stance.   I think he's cancerous to the locker room, and I believe the team's general inconsistent attitude is because their leader is emotionally unstable without any emotional intelligence. Your leader, who is a role player, makes terrible decisions on the court. Your coaching staff enables it.   But Marcus plays with heart, which is what the green teamers love. They have emotional connections to the team, so criticizing Smart is like criticizing a loved one. Too much bias to be objective with him.  When he's gone, the fanbase will reunite."
"Simmons Dejounte Dort Lowry Westbrook and probably more are better defensive guards than Marcus Smart and more valuable than him, Marcus Smart gets so ridiculously overrated here because he's a high motor guy"
Westbrook would be a train wreck in the Stevens offense.  He'd be jacking up 3's all game long at a clip that makes Marcus Smart look like Curry.
marcus smart?
Marcus Smart
Marcus smart
Marcus Smart? More like MARCUS DUMB.
"I've had the privilege of watching Marcus Smart chuck us out of games for 7 years, so I'm a little desensitized toward dogshit shooting nights lol"

Lol I love Marcus smart. His effort is nearly unmatched
"Marcus Smart, more like Marcus Dumb. Amirite?"
I love marcus smart and its to hard to watch him because he could shoot the lights out or go 3/12 on the night and there is no in between
"You are over the cap now. Even with Kemba expiring, you aren't getting 35mil in cap space. With Kemba opting in for 2022-23, you'll have about 95million committed between Jaylen, Jayson and Kemba. 2022-23 salary cap is estimated to be around 115.7mil. So that leaves about 20million or so for 12 players. Even adding in MLE, that's about 25 mil to work with.  This all assumes that you aren't re-signing other players in the meantime like Robert Williams, Marcus Smart in the meantime and that the salary cap isn't hit by other unforseen circumstances like covid or China."
"He's still great.  in no order OG Anunoby, Mikal Bridges, Marcus Smart (yeah he's a wing and a guard at the same time), Simmons, Jae'Sean Tate, Lebron, Dort, Butler, and him would be my top 9, I just chose 9 because I just woke up and I'm sure I forgot somebody good."
"Marcus ""Smart"""
That’s Marcus Smart for you. But he’ll have one good shooting game in a month and convince himself he’s the second coming of Ray Allen
More like Marcus Not-So-Smart
Marcus Smart 100% lost us that game. His shot selection is indefensible at this point
Thought this was about to be like the marcus smart play lol
Marcus “Smart”
"Marcus Smart is the true definition of a bot. His last name is too ironic, smh"
"Except for Marcus Smart, apparently."
The thing that is so entertaining about these clips is its either a marcus smart like play or a play like this and both are very entertaining.
"Yeah, being a Smart fan is exhausting. He went full Marcus Smart late but they kinda needed it, I thought he played fine tonight. Smart was flopping for sure but Zion was running people over all night with no calls too.  The C's were definitely missing Jaylen's size and athleticism on defense tonight."
"Well no, the only reason they are confused is because the clip lacks the context showing it was Pelicans ball beforehand.    Marcus Smart was literally playing in the game, he knew they had the ball before the jump ball..."
If you can't handle me at my Marcus Dumb you don't deserve me at my Marcus Smart
Live by the flop die by the flop fuck Marcus smart
Marcus sometimes Smart
That's not how you spell marcus smart
Marcus smart getting that last tech there is as good as giving up on the game. It's never over vs the pels. Maybe you get that call if you haven't been flopping to make up for your lack of talent for seven years
This loss is on Smart. Dude completely shifted the momentum of the game with the dumbest play I have ever witnessed in my life. Dude is such a fucking idiot sometimes he’s a good player but fuck this is the most extreme example I’ve seen from him of being Marcus Dumb. Fournier didn’t help but Smarts single play seemed more impactful then his 0-10 debut
"Marcus Smart flops a lot, but that last play wasn't a flop, morons in this thread"
"Celtics announcers basically saying ""our goal here was for marcus smart to flop hard enough for a foul and it just didnt work""  lmao"
Marcus smart is dog shit
Marcus smart taking a screen from Steven Adams sounds painful
"Marcus ""Dwight Howard"" Smart"
Marcus smart doing Marcus smart things
"I was at quite a few few those games that season he got traded, because the team was bad so tickets were cheap. They ended up winning 20 games that year. He really really really didn't want to be here, his body language was awful and you could probably see him checking the clock hoping this waa the last game before he got traded. He didn't want to be a part of the rebuild.   The trade also got us Jae Crowder and cleared the decks for Marcus Smart, who they tried at point guard until IT arrived."
"Ban Marcus Smart from the league, then maybe Boston will have a chance. Ban Brad too"
Marcus Smart needs to stop flopping every time someone gets close to him
Marcus not smart
Usually have to wait until the 4th quarter for Marcus Smart to turn into Jimmy Garrapolo
Untouchable Marcus Smart
Marcus (not) Smart
How has no one posted the Marcus Smart clip yet
"Marcus Smart, sometimes"
Zion could tomahawk dunk right on Tatum's head and I'd still be thinking about Marcus Smart  😂👏
Marcus (not) Smart
"Starting defense oriented guards. They're already kind of uncommon to begin with nowadays, but with how much more valuable forwards are, I see players like Marcus Smart as a dying breed."
He did Marcus Smart dirty lol
Wagner is super underrated   coincidentally he reminds me of Marcus Smart in some ways.
"Lmao, you really think that? Gobert is getting paid more than the max. Marcus Smart has made more money than Parker"
Marcus Smart is paid about what he’s worth imo.
Aye I was giving youre team a compliment why are you so angry? Still sad that Marcus Smart shut down Embiid? Or is it because you know Harris won't be able to hit a three pointer come playoff time?
"Kawhi killed his value far more than any other star in recent years. Some of our other offers included Marcus Smart and picks, Tobias Harris and 2 picks in the teens, Covington, Saric, and picks. For a top 5 player in the league. What KD has done is far less bullshit than what Kawhi did to the spurs."
"?????  Are you telling me Kyrie  + Hayward + Horford with Tatum, Brown and Marcus Smart was not a championship roster?"
"I felt like people were really overrating Marcus Smart in that trade. AG is 26 and a freak athlete, he’s a great wing defender and is promising on offense.   If he’s not isoing taking midrange pull-ups like my Magic had him do, and he’s playing with not 1 but 2 elite playmakers. AG is gonna be really really good on this squad."
"Sure you can. /r/nba criticises Lowry all the time. He plays hard and when you play hard sometimes you toe the line of being dirty. I don't think Lowry is going out trying to hurt people on purpose and I don't think that he's unacceptably dirty in the way Robert Horry or Patrick Beverley play. He's in that Goran Dragic, Marcus Smart tier of guys who play a hard game. As for flopping, another criticism of Lowry's, that seems to be the way the game is going. Most teams have a player or two who are similarly bad. This is an issue with the officials and how offensive players are rewarded for flopping.  You are talking to me, not my fan base. Some people get sensitive when it comes to their stars, but you can't generalize entire fan bases. I genuinely believe Ben Simmons is overrated and that his game won't translate well to playoff success. This is a matter of opinion and whenever I express that I'm met with a flood of downvotes from people who refuse to even engage in a discussion with me. Are they all Sixers fans downvoting me? Maybe. Does that mean that all Sixer fans have a sus amount of affection for Ben Simmons? Probably not."
Marcus Smart
I'm surprised Marcus Smart is not on here.
Marcus Smart against the Raptors and LeBronto ofcourse
"Gotta say, 3 ECF in the last 4 years is nothing to sneeze at. However, I will say very few players from those first two ECF runs ('16-'17 and '17-'18) and even big contributors from '18-'19 are still around, especially when you consider Jaylen Brown was playing 12 minutes a game in the first one. The only guy playing at a high level in each of the 4 years has been Marcus Smart. Like, I get there's been success, but to lump them all together is pretty disingenuous."
"Tatum: MVP &amp; 1st &amp; 2nd Team All-NBAs,  perennial All-Star   Brown: Keeps making All-Star, makes at least 1 All-NBA team  Marcus Smart: Continues making 1st Team All-Defense  Rob Williams: DPOY   Romeo Langford: 6MOY  Kemba: Hovers around pre-injury Kemba  Aaron Nesmith: Klay Thompson lite  Payton Pritchard: Better TJ McConnell  2 Championships. Break the tie with the Lakers. Beat the Lakers in the Finals"

"Fuck the celtics, nets, jazz and clippers. I dislike kd, harden, kyrie, d mitch, gobert, pat bev, marcus smart, wayoff pee. My fav non lakers are roco, og anunoby, miles turner"
"I'm a little uncomfortable with an announcer calling Marcus Smart a ""crafty veteran"".  Is this what it feels like to age?"
"Secretary of War, Marcus Smart"
"Yeah I think anything is on the table for Boston I joked yesterday they have to worry about making the playoffs. I can see one possibility here of itall going south and them not making it past the play in. I can also see an alternate of them finally finding things now and being dangerous in the playoffs even if they arent gonna win the East still.   Bucks/Celtics has been weird the past 2 yrs. I dont like the matchup for Bos. Despite his tepid play past 2 nights no great matchups vs Giannis. Middleton turns into Durant. Tatum outside of last night struggles vs them often. Them being really good getting back in transition affects Jaylen's offense. Bucks defense is built to bait guys like Marcus Smart into shooting too needless 3s. And yet all their games the past 2 yrs have been close. Just always find ways to get up for this matchup, if they play in the playoffs you might see a bunch of clsoe games."
"Let’s see the picks that surrounded them. Tatum was chosen over the consensus first overall pick Markelle Fultz, Lonzo Ball, and Josh Jackson.   Jaylen was drafted over Dragan Bender and Kriss Dunn.   Marcus Smart was drafted next to Nik Stauskas, Noah Vonleh, Dante Exum, and Jabari Bird.  At what point are we gonna dispel the idea that just because you are drafting high means that the pick is going to work out. It’s absolutely crazy to not reward GM’s for making the correct pick, even high in the draft.   Jayson is the best player out of everybody in his draft class. Jaylen is the best player in his as well (I personally think he’s better than Simmons because Simmons can just get schemed out in the playoffs and has been in the past).   I seriously don’t know why people use this as an argument."
Didn’t KD complain about Marcus Smart trying to draw a charge or something in the first round as well?
Ricky Rubio for Marcus Smart. Who says no?
"And it would be **REALLLLLY** funny if he was traded for Marcus Smart, Payton Pritchard, and picks to the **BOSTON CELTICS**!!!  I’m laughing just thinking about it  #HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  fucking kill me"
Dillon Brooks Julius Randle Zach LaVine Marcus Smart Christian Wood
Marcus Smart and Dillon Brooks might be the same player
"Maybe the Lakers can trade for Marcus Smart, I hear he's available."
"I can count ""Marcus Smart cost us the game by shooting"" on less than 4 fingers, don't even need the whole hand. None in the playoffs either.  ""Marcus Smart saved us by shooting"" games are definitely higher and more prominent"
How about retain Marcus Smart?
"Good thing it didn’t.   People just looked at his struggles on that end for like the first two or three weeks of the season after the shortest offseason ever, and his struggles for a week or two after returning from injury and ran with it. When healthy and rested, he was the exact same Marcus Smart."
"Did u just write this, there is no way that made sense in your head  Marcus Smart is not inefficient, he's just streaky if you ignore 70% of his games, this is what you're saying"
I’ll take 1 Marcus Smart please
It's almost like this Celtics team was assembled by looking at the Jays and signing the players that complement them the worst. They really need shooting and playmaking around them and Marcus fucking Smart is best other player at those things on the roster
"Cleveland is locking down their Big situation for the next decade. They might be expecting to flip assets for the next couple years.  Butler and Lowry is the basketball I want to watch. The final piece they need…. Marcus Smart. Lockdown D every guard and wing.  Chris Paul is smart, extending his career earnings while he’s hot.  Duncan Robinson is an overpay I think.  Hardaway js good value."
He pulls up for shots that he’s nowhere close to good enough to be taking.  That’s why he’s one of the only guys who’s less efficient than like marcus smart.   That+coming off of acl injury+ a mega ego gives me 3 great reasons not to touch him with a 10 foot pole if I’m Boston
2021 Marcus smart defense was not very good
Marcus smart traded to Indiana
Why would we swap Marcus Smart in a likely cap trade to get Dinwiddie when Smart shoots better and guards even better
Marcus smart is better than anyone they could hope to get backing up Harden and Irving
Marcus Smart on the Nets hurts my heart
Celtics really giving Marcus Smart to the Nets 😂
"Bro Marcus Smart is actually a good defender on 2K, MyPlayer barely sauces him up"
Marcus Smart for Spencer Dinwiddie in a sign and trade. Who says no?
"I mean if it’s open fuck the shot clock. Well, I guess not if you’re Marcus smart u probably shouldn’t shoot that"
"That’s gonna come down though there’s no way they’re getting that for him at this point. The only way his value goes up is if this bleeds into the regular season and Simmons is showing signs of changing who he is as a player. Even then, how confident are you that he will change? I’ve been watching Marcus Smart for nearly a decade in hopes that he will become a consistent jump shooter and it just hasn’t happened. Simmons is potentially similar and has mental issues in the sense that he’s literally afraid to take the shot and that is a huge problem."
What do y’all think about Marcus smart for Myles Turner
Well if they trade Marcus smart I guess they will need a guy jacking up 20 second shot clock 3s
And Brad Stevens sits on his thumbs while Marcus smart continues to chuck the Celtics out of any sort of hope of taking a leap
"No it’s Westbrook, not Marcus Smart"
"Fucking nailed it.   I hope this is the first thing Ime fixes: shot distribution. Theres not another team in the league that would let Marcus Smart shoot 6 threes a game, Carsen Edwards shoot from 30 feet, or let Grant Williams play minutes.   The Celtics have been mismanaged for years. Between Ainge's asset hungry FO and Steven's college basketball offense, there's a reason the Celtics have fallen short time and again."
Marcus smart overcame a tough childhood
"As a Celtics fan, my comrades are either very bullish on Marcus Smart or very bearish on Marcus Smart. Not a lot of in between here."
"Dwight Powell for Marcus Smart, who says no?"
"I took the lakers to win the west this past season, doesn’t make me a lakers fan. He had a history of shitting Marcus in videos and on his Twitter. Whenever he thinks smart does something dirty he’ll post the clip on Twitter and berate him. The only time he compliments smart is so he can then continue going in on him with slightly more credibility. Just look at the comments on his raptors Celtics videos from the bubble, I thought it was obvious his distaste but I guess not."
"Sign and trade causes problems because it hard caps the team receiving the signed free agent which severely limits their flexibility.  In addition, Brooklyn has to agree to a trade.  Would they do that?  Maybe - but Brooklyn isn’t just going to do Boston a favor and the nets would demand someone like Marcus smart."
"Bballbreakdown doesn’t like the Celtics and he REALLY doesn’t like Marcus smart. Those facts were obvious long before that video. I don’t disagree with everything be said in the video, but smart is a free-safety on defence. Occasionally he’ll mess up defensive rotations, but his off ball play is way closer to elite than it is to detrimental."
"Idk shit about the cap, but would it be possible for a Marcus smart/cj swap of some sort? I like smarts toughness with dame."
"Man, I would freaking love to have Marcus Smart in Philly if that was even remotely possible"
Marcus Smart would be a great fit.
"We were pretty damn healthy in the most important game of our season in Game 6 2020 ECF when Marcus Smart decided it was a good idea to chuck up 22 shots, more than Kemba Walker and Jaylen Brown.   He is a terrible decision maker, especially when it matters the most, no doubt about it."
Marcus Smart in Toronto would be unfair defensively lmao. I would hate to have to watch him on O though
Marcus Smart has one of the most punchable faces in the NBA
*brad in a laboratory under TD Garden trying to fuse Marcus Smart with Isaiah Thomas*
Marcus smart and Tatum for dinwiddie! Let’s goooooo
Marcus Smart 💦 14 points 🔥 2 assists 🥵 4-15 from 3 😫 lockdown defense 😤   Real drive of this time
Marcus Smart is my favorite player of all time but id drive him out to San Francisco if it meant we could have steph lol
"Dinwiddie for unpredictable Marcus smart, who says no?!"
"I speak for most Celtics fans when I say this but I’d rather lose with marcus smart than win with steph Curry. Smart is just our guy 🤷‍♀️.  Brad has already made tons of terrible moves this off-season like dumping kemba, getting jrich.  I cannot believe that we couldn’t keep ainge. He would have had us on a much better path."
Marcus Smart gives Marcus Smart the green light.
unpredictable feels like an odd word here. marcus smart seems to give it his all every game. many teams would love to have him.
If he hates Marcus Smart he’s gonna *love* Josh Richardson
"I’m not quite sure tbh. I love Marcus, but I’m hesitant given his history of deciding when it’s Marcus Smart time. Then again, he is playing with a new Head Coach for the first time in his career which could affect his playing style compared with Brad who constantly gave Marcus more liberty than he should’ve."
"Look, this is the deal with Smart:  Fact: he's an inverse volume scorer - the less he shoots and tries to score, the better he is.   Fact: he is an extremely versatile and fearless defender that thrives off of causing chaos, tipping balls, deflecting passes, and will make those plays when you least expect it and often most need it  Fact: he has the SKILLS to be a point guard, he's an underrated passer, and when he keeps his Assists at or above his FGA, the team wins at a ridiculous clip  Fact: he's a poor decision maker, especially late in games, and is an INCREDIBLY overconfident shooter for someone who has only shot above 40% FG once in 7 years. He shot more than 10 3's in a game last year 6 times despite shooting at a horrendous 33% clip. [He is 41st in 3PA but 142nd in 3P%, ](https://imgur.com/jgAIgso), that's a screenshot of the other players who take as many 3's as he does to demonstrate just how bad of a shooter he is, it can't be understated.   Question: will he acknowledge his shortcomings as an offensive player and embrace ball movement and being deferential, despite [saying he was committing to better shot selection in the past ](https://boston.cbslocal.com/2020/12/22/marcus-smart-cetics-shot-selection-great-shooter-nba/), and not changing one bit from the way he has been for 7 years?  I don't mind keeping him, but the Celtics are in trouble offensively as it is since it doesn't look like we will be re-signing Fournier, and putting Smart at PG is a literal experiment that could go horribly wrong if he doesn't reign in his shooting. Smart is a unique player and is definitely valuable to the team, but I also don't think asking him to redefine himself in his 8th year when he is going to be looking for his biggest pay day is a good strategy. I hope the C's have a few more moves coming for offensive help and a natural ball moving point guard, and I would like to keep Smart at the off-guard position if possible."
Marcus Smart shoots 10 to 12 shots a night when the team is healthy. He is not a volume shooter and does not try to be.
Lol yes. Marcus Smart is underrated offensively (underrated playmaker and good driver) and overrated defensively (dirty and makes some bonehead defensive decisions sometimes) but he is a starting level guard.
"If the Bulls can pull off signing Ball and D-Rose, they're going to be a dangerous playoff team next year. I really hope BOS doesn't steal Ball with a Marcus Smart S&amp;T... LaVine, Vooch, Rose, Ball, and Billy Donovan is such a nice core group, especially given Donovan's track record of excelling with three guards on the court and a big who can facilitate and do it all offensively."
"If Kemba gets bought out he goes to the Nets too and they have a battle of exes with the Celtics. The Celtics see their two exes Kyrie and Kemba on a date together and freak out. Jayson Tatum screams ""I never loved you"" at Kyrie and Marcus Smart says, passive-aggressively to Kemba ""It's so great that your standards have gone to shit along with your knees."
"So you think that Marcus Smart, coming off an injury, with a minutes restriction, only playing 2 games, choked more than Kyrie?   You think that 20 year old Tatum, who averaged 17/9/3/1/1 on 42%FG over the last 3 games, choked more than Kyrie?   Im not saying that everyone played great. But its ridiculous to act like Kyrie wasn't the biggest choker in that series. He was the superstar. He's held to a different standard."
"Yep Kyrie played pretty bad. Choked almost as bad that series as Jayson Tatum (36% FG, 2/16 from three), Gordon Hayward (34% FG), Terry Rozier (29% from the field, 3/19 from three), and of course Marcus Smart who made a whopping 1 basket."
Marcus Smart
Neil Olshey should be shot into the sun if the best player coming back in a Lillard trade is Marcus Smart.
"watching the Celtics for the past few years the thing this team has really been missing is a true PG that can run the offense and get the team some easy buckets while taking the load off of the stars. and ideally that guy would be 6'4"" or taller so that they can switch on defense without being hunted in the playoffs the way our short PGs always get hunted.  i love Marcus Smart but he's not that guy. he can make some plays but he is not in any way a true PG, and if i can trade him for a tall true PG that plays good defense i do it and don't really hesitate to do so.  the only reason i'd hesitate to do this trade is that it closes the door on acquiring Beal. i think that as long as Boston has the ability to create max space next summer it drives down what other teams will pay for him and makes whatever offer Boston can throw together look better. once Boston is no longer a threat to sign him next offseason they simply cannot win a bidding war."
Did you stop watching Lonzo after his rookie season and never watch a game that Marcus Smart has played?
Ah because Marcus Smart can?
"It's not overrating him LMFAO. If we trade for a big name player, Marcus Smart is literally the only player outside of the Jays that they'd be interested in. If we trade Marcus for Lonzo, not only do you lose the heart of the team, you arguably don't even get much of an upgrade for a much more expensive cost."
"Marcus Smart is literally a worse version of Lonzo at this moment, he is a chucker who can't shoot as well, a good defender and an okay passer  What does he have more than Lonzo? This shit is hilarious lmao"
"On Davion Mitchell's defence:  ""He be on people heels like a pair of socks.""   On Marcus Smart's toughness: [""If you see Marcus Smart and a bear getting in a fight, you need to help the bear.""](https://mobile.twitter.com/taylorcsnow/status/1227435797315510274?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1227435797315510274%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd-18251220081124324831.ampproject.net%2F2107170150000%2Fframe.html)  On Anthony Davis' defence against Jimmy Butler last year: [""He was stuck on Jimmy Butler like fat cells are stuck on me!""](https://mobile.twitter.com/GetUpESPN/status/1313839989575299073)  Even when he was still playing he was a character. [Here's  Perk and Zbo asking the ref to let them be a little more physical in the game.](https://youtu.be/gBoTggz8zQs)"
I think he is in Sacramento now but Terrance Davis can turn into that Marcus Smart type you need on your time. You said reach… so I just reached deep for a breakout. Nostradamus out.
That was a Marcus smart dolphin flop
"Look, you can say that all of those guys got overpaid all day long, but it doesn't change the fact that the Celtics have gotten progressively worse as they keep losing these players to other teams willing to pay them. You lose Kyrie, Horford and Hayward to free agency, then this summer you lose Kemba and replace him with Horford, who's not very good anymore, and who also will probably be gone again in a year. Now you're also losing Fournier, and what happens if Marcus Smart also wants a big contract? Do you just let him walk too? What about Robert Williams? What if someone makes him a giant offer next summer?   At some point you have to start retaining some of these guys, even if it's expensive to do so. If you don't and the Celtics spend the next couple years like they did this year, what makes you think Jaylen Brown is going to feel comfortable with the direction of the team and their commitment to building a winner? For whatever reason, Boston fans seem to think that the same thing that's happened to so many other teams can't happen to them, and that Tatum and Brown will be Celtics for their whole career. All you have to do is look around at how many star players have asked out or bailed in free agency just because they didn't like the situation. Don't get too comfortable, those guys could bolt too."
This post led me to confirm that Marcus smart always ends up with the ball at the worst possible time.  28 career heaves is insanely high someone who was a historically poor shooter the first 4 years of his career.
That’s a Smart answer by Marcus.
Marcus “Ted Lasso” Smart
"I think it's a dangerous game the Celtics are playing with all this cost cutting to avoid the luxury tax year after year. They're acting like Tatum and Brown will never get unhappy with the Celtics and will be there no matter what. But look at how many teams have lost stars after their second contract ends simply because they're not happy with the direction of the team.   Can Boston keep going summer after summer losing key rotation guys to free agency like this? Kyrie and Horford two years ago, Hayward last summer, Fournier this summer, maybe Marcus Smart next summer? Tatum and Brown are really good, but they need more around them. If Boston keeps losing these guys like this every year then it's almost inevitable that they'll clearly be heading in the wrong direction, and that's really not what you want when your stars are approaching free agency. Brown's free agency is 3 years from now and Tatum's is 4. Can Boston really afford to sink the next two years into ""development""?"
"No, Boston will be well over the cap this summer and figure to be over it again next summer. This talk about making a run at Bradley Beal next year I don't think is realistic at all. To do that the Celtics would have to just let Fournier walk and also not extend Marcus Smart and Robert Williams. Then they'd also have to just not guarantee Horford's contract in 2022-23, meaning they'd be paying him $14.5 million not to play for them.   Beal's max next summer would be just over $40 million, with the cap being at $115 million. That amount combined with Tatum's and Brown's contracts would equal $99 million just for those three players. That means to sign Beal as a free agent the Celtics would have to figure out a way to dump Horford to a team with cap space (which I'm guessing would take another 1st round pick), and they'd have to renounce rights on everyone else except maybe for Pritchard and Nesmith. To me that seems *extremely* unlikely."
"The Celtics don't have any cap space, I'm not sure what the OP was referring to. The salary cap is going to be $112 million. Even forgetting all the smaller stuff around the margins, here's what the top of Boston's cap sheet is looking like in broad strokes:  * Tatum - $28 million  * Horford - $27 million  * Brown - $26 million  * Smart - $14 million  * Richardson - $11 million  * Kris Dunn - $5 million  That's $111 million just for those guys, and that's not including the 7 other guys that are already under contract for next year. The Celtics are not clearing any cap space to go after free agents.   To answer the question the guy you replied to asked, about why they're shedding so much salary, I've been saying this for quite some time now and almost always get downvoted for it, but they're trying to stay below the luxury tax. That's all this is.   They're trying to stay below it now, and they're trying to stay below it in the future as well. It's why they didn't want to pay to keep Horford and Hayward when they got bigger offers than Boston wanted to pay, it's why they used their TPE on a guy who's contract expired when Tatum's extension kicked in, and it's why negotiations with that guy (Fournier) aren't going anywhere. It's why they swapped two years and $74 million of Kemba for two years and $41 million of Horford, losing a pick in the process. It's why they dumped TT, and it's why they got Richardson (cause he'll be a worse but cheaper alternative to Fournier).   Something to keep a close eye on this summer, in addition to these talks with Fournier, is the upcoming extension negotiations with Marcus Smart and Robert Williams. I wouldn't be surprised if those don't go well either and Boston ends up hoping they can get them back for cheap next summer. But again, look how well that worked for them with Horford, Hayward, and now Fournier, apparently.  Boston's ownership is notoriously resistant to paying the luxury tax. Boston fans never want to accept that, but it's true. [Boston has paid less in luxury tax in the last 10 years than other super cheap teams like the Bulls, Spurs and Rockets have.](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/cba/tax/) Boston's owners often say that ""they'll pay the tax for a contender"" but this cost cutting is very much affecting how good their team is, and if they're not careful they're going to fail to build a significant contender around Tatum and Brown before those guys hit free ageand in a few years. They need to be careful."
"As a Celtics fan, this shit is driving me insane. We have a guy we know fits well with the team, he fits a MAJOR need as a #3 scorer and the best shooter on the team, we have his Bird Rights, and we just loaded up on defensive players. Why exactly are we wringing our hands over $20 mil for him? So we're gonna let him walk and ignore the fact that our #3 scorer becomes Marcus Smart at 13 PPG on horrendous efficiency?"
"Every team has flaws, I suppose they could trade each of them separately for maybe Pat Bev, Marcus Smart, or something similar."
Might make sense if they are turning Marcus smart into something. He’s got a good contract size. J rich might be a sort of replacement for him. Other guys point was that it could make more sense in the long run. Josh Richardson is a useful player even though he had a couple down years.
… is Marcus Smart.
Marcus Smart is an absolute Legend!
King shit  Balling with Marcus Smart and being honest
Marcus Smart releases his dark side on the court so he can be a bro off of it
He called Aaron Nesmith Marcus Smart like 4 times in 1 game and called Romeo Marcus Smart once in that same game. He's a legend but damn he fell off.
for real though I don't get this move for the Celtics. they don't need another guy who basically not that good at anything but defense. they have Marcus smart who's just a better J Rich at this point. Moses would have set them up with another solid big who's also fucking huge for the times when Time Lord is too small. i really don't get the appeal here.
"Shooting like they did against literally the 29th defense is criminal  Marcus Smart and Rozier deserve jail time, they took more shots combined than Tatum who was owning, they went 3/24   That Cavs team was historically bad defensively"
Every hot Marcus Smart game has a mid-game sequence of like 2 or 3 misses on ridiculous heat checks before he settles down
"That very well could be the case, but Tatum and Brown are going to be really easy to defend if they are passing the ball off to Marcus Smart and Josh Richardson when they get doubled."
Marcus Smart
This means Marcus Smart is gone. Wonder who are going to trade with?
Yall traded for Kris dunn and Josh Richardson. Seem like cheap replacements for Marcus smart if he's dealt maybe? I could see yall trading him and then re-signing him next year
We just got Kris Dunn and J-Rich. Add them to Marcus Smart and our offense is solved.
&gt; We can now realistically create a max slot to go after Beal for example.  I can guarantee you that the Celtics are not even going to attempt to do that. To do that you guys would have to not try to re-sign Evan Fournier and you'd have to not even try to negotiate a contract extension with either Marcus Smart or Robert Williams. There's no chance the Celtics are gonna do that when every report is Beal has no intention of leaving Washington.
"You're not getting a 20 PPG scorer for the MLE, my friend. The Celtics are already down 20 PPG from Kemba, if we let Fournier walk as well, I'll say again, we are fucked offensively. Marcus Smart and Al Horford aren't making up that difference, and in order to get someone to pick up the slack, we're actually going to have to trade someone because we don't have the space to sign anyone anyways. The Celtics need Fournier."
Boston got their point guard.  Wait.  Who is the Celtics point guard?  Marcus Smart?  Pritchard?  Maybe Smart or someone gets traded?
"Please be Marcus Smart, I have no idea how, but please be Marcus Smart"
"Remember OG Anunoby? Was a great defender couldn't shoot. Made the team anyway. Remember Giannis Antetokoumpo? Couldnt shoot, made the team anyway. Marcus Smart? Couldnt shoot, made the team anyway. A lot of players who can defend can't shoot early on get on the team and get minutes. Teams NEED defenders."
...why are we acting like Marcus Smart doesn't score? That's a few years expired take
"Lol I made up what? Tristian Thompson, Marcus Smart mentioned racism issue in Boston and a ton of opposing players have brought up in the past.   Next thing you gonna tell me slavery was also made up and you probably think covid is a hoax. Lol"
People are going to meme about how Boston just solved their PG issues  Real ones know that Kris Dunn and Marcus Smart on the floor at the same time is going to absolutely eat backcourts alive on the defensive end. It's going to be fucking chaos when those two are together. Seriously. Hide your fucking guards. They won't be safe.  Really happy for my guy KD.
"The price was way too high, people wanted a Harden return for guys that were half as good as Harden.  So now if we are dealing, it's for the positions Kuminga, Wiseman, or Moody have and from a value perspective both financially and on the court there just aren't there.  I was high on getting someone like Marcus Smart or Myles Turner but those aren't getting us over the hump and getting a big name means we have to give up Wiggins which leaves a gap.  Quite frankly, with Kuminga doing well in the G League bubble (which I rate higher than college) I'd probably value him more than what teams would want to give for him."
Huge respect to Jayson Tatum. He showed tremendous fight along with the rest of the Hospital Celtics.  I hate Marcus Smart with a passion but that dude would NOT have let his teammates fold like the Bucks just did.  Bucks need to find their mental fortitude if they want to get back into this. Giannis looking shook at the FT line was some sad shit to watch.
"Just take the best 12 (or so)  Kentucky players and let  Cal Coach.  1. Fox 2. Booker 3. Randle 4. Bam 5. Kat   Bench. Hero, Monk, WCS, Noel.  Add Tatum, Middleton and Marcus smart. That should result in a 25k gold medal.  Your thoughts?"
Marcus Smart gotta be the only player to take heat check passes.  He hits one good pass you know some crazy stuff about to happen
"It’s Marcus Smart. Man will go 0-6, make 1 three and dial up a heat check.  Tho he’s reigned it in a tiny bit since his 2nd or 3rd year"
For relevant players its Marcus Smart.
"Some guys I was REALLY high on at recent Celtics draft positions:  -  * 2020, Pick #26: **Tyrell Terry** – got Payton Pritchard instead  * 2019, Pick #14: **Sekou Doumbouya or Goga Bitadze** – I'd still take either over Romeo Langford but none are really blowing up the league  * 2017, Pick #1: **Markelle Fultz** – got Jayson Tatum instead  * 2016, Pick #3: Take **Dragan Bender** or trade down and get **Jakob Poeltl** – got Jaylen Brown instead  * 2014, Pick #6: I thought **Noah Vonleh** was the new Chris Bosh – got Marcus Smart instead"
"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kobe-bryant-and-the-draft-day-trade-that-changed-nba-history/  &gt;There may be shades of gray to Kobe's version of this story, but it's ridiculous to think he had no say in where he ended up. Kobe was, and still is, a very smart guy. Having spent much of his youth in Italy where his father, ""Jellybean"" Bryant, spent seven years playing professionally, he was cultured and wise beyond his 18 years. The guy speaks three languages fluently. He knew what was best for him. He knew who the Lakers were and what their brand represented. And while others certainly couldn't have predicted how truly great he was going to be, Kobe, from day one, intended to become nothing less than an NBA and global icon.   &gt;In 1996, before the Internet and social media had limited the business leverage of the big market, you didn't do that in Charlotte. You did it in places like Los Angeles. The only question was: How was Kobe going to get there?  &gt;For starters, 12 teams had to pass on him. That's where West and Tellem came in. Together, they began orchestrating a series of skipped workouts and floating rumors in an all-out effort to deter any and all suitors. There was also something else working in their favor. Back then, Kevin Garnett had only rebroken the seal of high school players going straight to the NBA one year earlier, and there was still plenty of skepticism about an 18-year-old making that jump. Bryant was a risk. Guys like eventual top pick Allen Iverson, Marcus Camby and Ray Allen were seen as much safer, if not altogether better picks than Kobe.   &gt;The Lakers, of course, loved this. They felt like they knew something everyone else didn't. West had dynastic visions of growing Bryant alongside Shaquille O'Neal, the prized free agent of that summer whom West was intent on snatching from the Orlando Magic. But in order to have the money to pay Shaq what he was clearly going to demand on the open market, the Lakers couldn't pay Bryant top dollar right away. They had to push him outside the lottery, where they would only have to pay him for that set salary slot.   &gt;The first pick outside the lottery was the Hornets at No. 13. They needed a center. The Lakers had Vlade Divac. It was the perfect crime.   &gt;Kobe, allegedly, didn't want to play for the Nets due to a falling out with his family. Rumors suddenly began flying that Bryant was willing to play in Italy if he didn't end up with the NBA team of his desire. In other words, the Lakers."
"Evan Fournier, Jabari Parker, Tristan Thompson, Marcus Smart and Semi Ojeleye are the only celtics that have been in the league for more than 2 years. The rest are late 1st and 2nd round picks from the last 2 years. That is the Celtics team without Tatum in the playoffs this year. That team wins 20 games in a season in the East. It is probably a worse version of that Cavs team in 2018-2019 that won 19 games.  Kristaps Porzingas, Tim Hardaway Jr, Dorian Finney-Smith, Boban Marjanović, Josh Richardson, Maxi Kleber, hell, the entire Mavs roster is NBA veterans. A lot of them + veterans. They'd probably win 35 games in the East.   Luka is a fantastic player, but his supporting cast was clearly better than Tatum's this year's playoffs. It's just a fact."
I mean Marcus Smart was his best defender bar none when he was on the Knicks
"He's not strong enough to bang inside. I think he just has a really high center of gravity because this guy was regularly getting bodied by Marcus Smart in the post. He's a 7'3"" wing player, he's not a big man."
Just do the dive like John Wall/Marcus Smart
"I didn’t understand why he continued to use a zone even while the Clippers broke it with ease and lit them up, but in man coverage nobody could guard Kawhi so  that’s tough. Mav’s need better defenders, shooters, and a secondary ball handler ASAP. They should really go after Marcus Smart"
Marcus smart for KP?
"pulling stats from one series lmao. Marcus Smart is 219th out of 230, you really think Smart is a bottom 5% defender? these statsexuals man"
I’m definitely not creative or funny. I was referring to when Doncic accidentally kicked Marcus Smart last year since the person I was replying to had a Celtics flair. I have a weird sense of humor.
Make a package deal involving KP to Cleveland for Kevin Love and Collin Sexton.   Trade with Boston for Marcus Smart.
"Our first option should be trying to acquire Myles Turner. If he’s out of reach, Richaun Holmes should be the second option. I also like the idea of getting Derozan in a sign and trade with Porzingis if trading for Turner doesn’t work out. I’ve also heard people mentioning trading for Marcus Smart. Not sure how realistic that is but he’d be a great backcourt parter for Luka."
The Mavs need to focus on two things. Surrounding Luka with competent scorers and decent to above average defenders. If im the Mavs im pursuing Marcus smart HARD AF
"Marcus Smart for KP, who says no?"
Embiid fell over like Marcus Smart when a sniper is in the audience
"Trae owns Marcus smart too, but at least Smarts actually elite on defense"
marcus smart is better
Would love to see him and Marcus smart get into a tiff
"Celtics fan here, not even Marcus Smart did this shit for us this year."
hijacking top comment to ask.. how is jaylen brown even considered a SG?  is marcus smart considered a SF? lol
Marcus Smart could be a good fit if Celtics shop him. Strong defender and brings a leadership presence for a Bulls team with star offensive power
Jaylen Brown/Marcus Smart/1st round picks for Lillard
"Yeah, Marcus Smart bit him. He was trying to go for the ass, but he ended up getting a piece of the thigh instead."
"Its some real smooth brain stuff when people compare statlines like they matter.  I dont care that he was the best player on his team, the dudes supposed to be that.  If Tatum has a bad series I dont deflect with ""well he played better than Marcus Smart"".  Like no shit he outplayed Shroder, Shroder isn't in the conversation for GOAT so no fuck he is better."
"Well yeah but jayson tatums supporting cast consisted of Marcus Smart and the ghost of Kemba Walker, not two other borderline all-nba talents who are great at perimeter defense."
"Prime Brook Lopez was back when he was a Net and had no 3 point shot. KP can’t work to his spot because he’s too weak, the shorter defender has the leverage and can stop KP from backing them down by jus using an arm. He has to bulk up if he wants to play in the post, he can’t even back down Marcus Smart."
He and KAT can form a super team in Orlando with Marcus Smart.
"That was one of the best nationally televised regular season games this season with Tatum and Curry both going nuclear. And in typical Warriors fashion, Draymond missed a game tying layup that ended up sealing the deal (with Marcus Smart taking out Kent Bazemore with a fake pass that had him running a circle before just standing there while Smart contemplated the existence of life before taking his sweet time to swish a 3 pointer).  JTA flew out of bounds saving the ball that Curry caught and sunk a 3, but unfortunately after he crashed over the scorer's table he hit his head on the same type of metal plating that Curry broke his tailbone on and got a concussion and 35 stitches."
Oh so Marcus Smart?
"THJ &gt; CJ tho, KP is better too. Clips are literally the worst matchup in the league for him, them and Marcus Smart"
"Dude, we are so badly constructed, new coach, new front office (for the first time in over ten years), Kemba got a bum knee, Brown is coming off an injury, and it's a contract year for Marcus Smart. The team is going to fucking implode next season.   My guess is that they push all their chips in the following year to keep Brown and Tatum for one more contract."
boston has a lightly used marcus smart that they may not want anymore
LOL Marcus smart?
Blake Griffin is our Marcus Smart without any of the actual defensive talent. He's one of the league leaders in charges and he's gonna flop a ton vs Giannis. If the ref whistle is as generous for the Nets as r/nba claims it is Giannis might have a harder time than expected.
* Pacers get CJ McCollum  * Blazers get Marcus Smart  * Celtics get Malcolm Brogdon  Add in whatever draft picks and filler players you need to make everything balanced. Who says no?
"In a sweep. I think their strategy paid off well. I also recall Embiid having trouble scoring on 6'3"" Marcus Smart in the post when it mattered most. The guy shrinks in the biggest moments."
"Marcus Smart, Kemba Walker, 4 first round picks"
traded to Boston for Marcus Smart and Robert Williams
"Honestly all the Crowder hate sucks to me. I love LeBron, but part of the fun in being a fan is still seeing people take jabs and taunt the players you root for, and hoping they get them back, even if in cases like this, the guy I rooted for doesn't get the last laugh. At least Crowder's been a good player for multiple teams, and gets to earn bragging rights for helping take the Lakers down. Pat Beverly is just the evil, unskilled version of Marcus Smart and only gets to talk shit because he has two of the best wings in the game as his teammates."
Serious question  OP do you really think anyone gives a fuck about the Olympics?   There is such a lack of players who give a fuck that the 2019 team included:  Harrison Barnes Mason Plumlee Brook Lopez Derrick White and Marcus Smart
Nah we trade Ant and CJ for a 3/4 and sign some good young defenders. Re-sign Powell.  I feel like if we had a Marcus Smart type player to complement Dame and a better defensive 4 off the bench this team takes a big leap. I think CJ would be more than enough to get those needs.
"Just [check your team's history](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/cba/tax/) and you'll see how rarely the Celtics pay the luxury tax. It's not just me saying this either, check out [this article from yesterday](https://hoopshype.com/lists/whats-next-for-boston-celtics-marcus-smart-trade-evan-fournier-free-agency/) and this quote from an NBA executive:  &gt; “He’s going to look for $15-20 million a year,” an NBA executive estimated when speaking to HoopsHype. “I’m not sure where he gets that from. They’ll have to keep him since they can’t replace him. **It’ll be interesting because they have never been willing to pay the tax**, so getting around that will be hard for them. If they let him walk, there’s no replacement.”  Even Celtics beat writers will tell you that the Celtics ownership is extremely reluctant to pay the tax, saying that they say they'll do it ""for a winner"", but clearly that's not what this team is."
Realistically I think we'll be shopping in the Marcus Smart-tier and hoping to round out some other positions of need in the same deal to match salaries.
I'd give Jaylen Brown &amp; Marcus Smart + 1st rounders for him...
Marcus Smart
"The package to get Harden would've basically left us with Jayson, maybe Kemba (and we saw how that worked out this year), and the current bench minus Marcus Smart. Harden isn't/wasn't winning us a championship. The Celtics need to get out of salary cap hell somehow, but I genuinely have no idea how they can do that. But fuck it, maybe Brad's secretly a roster construction genius lmao."
It’s bc Marcus Smart is an excellent defender and doesn’t need the ball. The Celtics already have Tatum &amp; Brown to run their offense through so CJ would just take touches away from them
"Fuck, I must be underrating Marcus Smart - Blazers might have to throw in another 1RP to make it happen, but it would 100% be worth it for them."
Marcus smart is better for the Celtics than CJ would be. Celtics hang up that call
"Imagine if Blazers traded CJ and a 1RP for Marcus Smart...   Dame/Smart/Norm/RoCo/Nurk could win the chip! No weak link on defence and the offence would be even better with Smart being the #2 scoring option. Fuck, I’ve just hyped myself up thinking about it - this needs to happen now!"
"if that was marcus smart instead of lillard at end of regulation in g5, does he get a flopping fine?"
"I mean I get Wiseman wasn’t great this year but holy crap if Marcus Smart, Terrance Ross, or Thaddeus Young are the best the warriors can do for Wiseman they should 100 percent keep him"
"[There's already talk that Smart is the most likely player the Celtics trade this summer.](https://hoopshype.com/lists/whats-next-for-boston-celtics-marcus-smart-trade-evan-fournier-free-agency/) Smart is up for an extension this summer and it's a good bet he wants more than Boston will be willing to pay him, so they'd probably be better off trading him now rather than waiting till free agency and seeing him just walk like Horford and Hayward did."
"Marvin has a long way to go, but he was starting to play well right before injury this season  January and February he was shooting well from 3, TOs were down a little and he started taking charges well and took 10 this season in 43 games (per 48 minutes it's around the same as Draymond and Marcus Smart)  I'm still not sold on him being amazing or an All-star but he's starting to show flashes of the impact that he can bring if he cleans up his game on offense and can be passable on defense  I've said it before but in the end defense will hold Bagley back, he isn't able to play the 4 reliably and is too small for the 5. If he can start playing decent defense at the 4 though he can easily be a very impactful player."
"Bob Myers and Steve Kerr met with reporters on Monday afternoon, wrapping the just-completed Warriors season. Myers speaks far less regularly than Kerr and isn’t often as forthcoming as he was in this interview. So his answers, leading into this crucial offseason, were the most noteworthy.  It isn’t too difficult to read the planned direction the Warriors intend to take. Myers said he’s “pretty confident” the team will work out a contract extension with Stephen Curry this summer, which will be the formal $215 million max commitment to the next five seasons of Curry’s closing title window.  “When you’re lucky enough to kind of fall into a player like that in my position, you owe it to them to try to win,” said Myers, the president of basketball operations. “Those people don’t come along too often.”  Does that mean a home run swing to maximize next season’s roster, at all costs? No. Because we know, even before the summer market materializes, there will be teams willing to trade bit parts for long-term control of a prospect with the upside of James Wiseman. Think Boston would flip Marcus Smart’s expiring $14 million deal for him? Would Chicago send Thaddeus Young? Would Orlando part with Terrance Ross?  Of course. The decade-long possibility of Wiseman is more valued than a season or two of a steady role player. Smart, Young and Ross are better 2021 NBA players than Wiseman and would presumably nudge next season’s Warriors team closer to the title conversation, barring a huge Wiseman sophomore leap.  But the internal belief within the Warriors is that’d be bad business — selling low on a 20-year-old you drafted second overall seven months ago before giving his talent a chance to blossom. That’s why Myers delivered this quote when asked about the idea of trading Wiseman for immediate help.  “No,” Myers said. “I think he can help us. I expect him to be on the team next year. We don’t want to trade James Wiseman. I think he’s a tremendous talent and he was put in a position where, again, the guy is taking hopefully all of his lumps early in his career, but I think he can be very helpful to us in the future. I think he can be helpful in the present. We plan on him being on the team. We plan on him helping us.”  It’s naive to read that quote as an iron-clad lock. Remember this soundbite?   Seven months after delivering that quote, Myers did trade D’Angelo Russell in the first season of a four-year deal. But that reroute was only made when a delicious enough deal materialized — Andrew Wiggins plus both of Minnesota’s 2021 draft picks. If the Timberwolves aren’t obsessed with him, who knows when or if Russell is moved.  Myers can’t say it and shouldn’t say it, but of course, the right offer could move him off Wiseman. What if a rebuilding team like the Thunder dangled Shai Gilgeous-Alexander for Wiseman and these two upcoming first-rounders? Or if Houston suggested a Christian Wood center swap to better fit each other’s timelines? We could list 25 other intriguing hypotheticals.  But as of now, the Warriors seem to be operating under the assumption that a can’t-miss deal won’t arrive at their doorstep and are comfortable entering the season with an older Wiseman, who Myers said should be ready for training camp after rehabbing his knee injury this summer.  “We really hope and think that he’ll be available for that,” Myers said.  If the Minnesota pick conveys, it’ll most likely be in the six to eight range. The Warriors’ own pick is almost assuredly going to be 14th overall. Lottery night (June 22) is the first big summer checkpoint. It’ll deliver them a better idea of which prospects they could possibly draft and give trade partners a better ability to evaluate what type of package the Warriors could offer.  Myers wasn’t dismissive of the idea of adding two more rookies to a roster that already includes Wiseman. But it’s clear, if that’s the path they choose, the Warriors will be searching for more polished players ready to compete immediately. The idea would be to go into the season with Wiseman as the biggest project on the roster.  “I do think young players can help,” Myers said. “It depends on when or how.”  But changes are still coming. Alen Smailagic won’t populate the roster. Gary Payton II, Mychal Mulder and Damion Lee have a tenuous grip on their non-guaranteed spots. The meat of the Warriors rotation needs a boost and Myers made it clear what type of players those have to be, a mandate internally agreed upon by Curry, Draymond Green, Kerr and on up.  “I do know we need veterans,” Myers said. “We have to add some veterans in free agency. We just have to. We’re well aware of that. We’ll try to do it. We actually tried to do it last year with a few guys, so it wasn’t as if that mindset didn’t exist. It doesn’t matter, nobody cares, but we were in second place with quite a few guys that I think could have helped, but they chose to go to a team after Klay (Thompson’s) injury that they thought they could win it more and that’s fair to them.”  Myers even further clarified his free-agent preferences.  “The ones that have kind of done it before, maybe been in playoff series,” Myers said. “Guys that maybe can stretch the floor, maybe a shooting big, maybe a play-making guard. Our defense I think finished fifth. Maybe some more offensive-minded guys."""
True true for example Marcus Smart shot 350 3's a day for 3 years to get his percentage up.  It's what guys do now.
"The thing is I don’t think Jaylen wants to go back to just spot up shooting. He keeps improving and was an All-Star, and when Hayward left he had to fill that role of facilitating. I think he’s going to continue to want the ball and not just stand in the corner. Which is fine, but if you notice who’s doing catch and shoot, most of the guys just aren’t consistent enough. Smart has never been a great shooter, and all the other guys are too young and haven’t developed their shot as much. There’s flashes of it but we need guys who are knockdown and proven shooters because Marcus Smart, Grant Williams, Semi Ojeleye and Romeo Langford missing open 3’s is taking points off the board. Smart at least has value outside of his shooting deficiencies, but they could really use a guy like Luke Kennard, Tim Hardaway Jr, or Duncan Robinson. Fournier takes so many off balance shots I wish he wasn’t trying to do so much with the ball (like he had to in Orlando). I think next year will be better for him if they re-sign him  I don’t think they need a stretch big (although it doesn’t hurt) but rather a guy that’s great on the glass so he can pull down boards and go back up with it, or kick it out to open guys when defenses fall apart. Robert Williams is great at this and is a good passer, Tristan Thompson would be great at this but every time he pulls down a rebound he gets tunnel vision and almost always goes back up with it"
"He kept calling Nesmith ""Marcus Smart"" over multiple games.  Dude needs to retire.   Anyone witness mix up any white players' names?"
"he’s always done this shit, Marcus Smart would always dominate him on the Knicks"
I don’t know how to add a picture here but google Marcus smart and jimmy butler. They got into each other’s faces a few years ago and there is definitely not 4” apart. Marcus’s nose is at Jimmy’s top lip.
"Really difficult to have the complete package like Butler.  It's a perfect combination of size, athleticism, BBIQ, and hustle.  Like if Marcus Smart were 4 inches taller he'd be pretty close.  But that size is critical to be able to attack the rim like Butler can."
Marcus Smart
I’d prefer Marcus Smart over buddy Hield. It’s not really close neither
"Also these executive surveys/interviews are always disappointing because you get an idea for how out of touch some of them are.  &gt;“I think they’ll trade Smart this summer if I had to guess,” an NBA executive told HoopsHype. “Retool around Tatum and Brown if they can get real value for Smart, but a lot up in the air there.”   Looking at the leading players assisting the Jays:    Jayson| Jaylen ---|--- Marcus |Marcus  Jaylen|	Jayson Kemba|	Kemba Rob |	Payton Grant |	Rob     Looking at their Offensive Rating with Marcus On/OFF:  Player| Marcus OFF| Marcus ON ---|---|---- Jayson | 112.2| 116.8	 Jaylen| 112.3	| 112.2   Looking at their worst scoring nights:   * With Marcus: Jaylen and/or Jayson had ≤5FGM in 4/48 games when Marcus played.   * Without Marcus: Jaylen and/or Jayson had ≤5FGM in 10/24 games when Marcus didn't play.  The Jays are 5 times more likely to have a terrible scoring night when Marcus sits.   ***  He's a pass-first PG who leads the charge in getting the Jays involved and their worst scoring nights are often when Smart sits.   He's a big switchable and highly regarded defender which capitalises on the Jay's switchable defensive skills.   He's able to impact the game from a very limited role which gives the Jays more freedom to take over.     If we were to build around the Jays we'd trade **for** Marcus Smart."
"Yeah, even on the Knicks when he was significantly better Marcus Smart used to take his lunch money."
Marcus ‘Not Too’ Smart. Fires away from 3 like he thinks he can actually shoot worth a damn.
"Marcus Smart was taken with the Celtics’ own pick that year, it was James Young at 17 that was the first Nets pick from that big trade."
"Marcus smart came to mind first, at least offensively"
Trade CJ for Marcus smart
"To be fair, he’ll make that shot.  And I’d much rather see people remember how to play a midrange game, rather than the ‘kick out to the perimeter, AND BRICK ALL THE THREES!!!’ offense that we’ve been running.  Seriously, Marcus Smart is the patron saint of bricks."
so u think marcus smart is better than dennis schroder?
"Lol, the Celtics were not ""stacked"". The J's were barely fetuses, Brown was out half the time (if I remember correctly), Horford and Smart was solid and then... what? Marcus Morris? Scary Terry?  That's a decent team for sure, but they're facing the Lebron for God's sakes. Give me a break."
"Marcus Smart, he always goes hard and isn't afraid to take big shots"
"KAT, definitely!  Beal, honestly don’t see how that would be much different than CJ so I’ll pass.  Marcus Smart would be nice tho"
"Cj’s issue is that he compliments dame by just being a store brand version of dame. That’s mot even meant to be hate, but it’s true. The thing is at the end of the day you don’t have a lot to throw at people.   I think you need a player like Marcus Morris, who can both start and come off the bench and get you value, OR you invest in getting a very deep guard rotation that compliment dame differently. Like maybe move cj for someone like Marcus smart. Someone named marcus for sure.   Alternatively, you can keep cj and try and make a move for someone like Patrick beverley(this would be low key pretty funny.) if you want to live or die by your guards, you can still do that, but dame and store brand dame aren’t going to be doing you too many favors."
"We *could've*, but would we have? You can get a bigger name, but it's really damn hard to get big names when your assets are a TPE, the shell of Kemba Walker, and Marcus Smart. Fournier's a decent player that we can go over the cap to re-sign, which is helpful when we have next to no cap space to begin with."
"marcus smart was the 6th pick, and the rest you mentioned could easily be out of the league in 2 years. just like all the other non-top celtics draft picks"
Marcus Smart in a D'Antoni scheme will either drop 70 or 6. Probably in back to back games
"Robert Williams, Langford, Pritchard, Nesmith can all be solid players. Marcus smart is another good draft pick"
"smh, Marcus Smart is a superstar"
We will take Marcus Smart. Thanks.
Please Boston trading a defense-first dervish to the Grizzlies again.  First Tony Allen. Now Marcus Smart. It makes too much sense to me.  Please give.
"Wasn’t Kemba pretty bad to start the season, and missing back to backs? Two stars and Marcus Smart is basically a .500 team."
"They should've done this two years ago.   Keep Covington, Powell, and maybe Simons + DJJ for the right prices. Nurkic could probably stay, but I'm not sure if he's the optimal rim protector you want.   Try and snag Myles Turner, if Indiana is giving up. Get a Jrue Holiday type guy, hell maybe Marcus Smart is available. Do what you gotta do. Stop wasting Dame's fucking time. He's stupidly loyal for some reason."
Fournier is not worth that money. Marcus Smart is all heart I wouldn’t want to lose him.
"I mean, I agreed with what you said initially. And regardless of the Single Point of Failure offense, D'Antoni isn't big on defense too. So no matter how good Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart can be, unless you have a scheme that can keep the offense guessing, it's pretty redundant because the team won't be executing the same thing."
One Marcus Smart please
He kind of called this. He said I don’t think we lose Stevens but Ainge is probably gone; he also prophesied Marcus Smart being traded. The last one was on Sunday the first one was during the play in.
"On paper that team was insane. A team where Jaylen Brown is the fourth best player, and you have Al Horford, Marcus Smart, and Marcus Morris too. Plus Baynes and Theis who were good role players. They were 1 win away from making the conference finals without Kyrie or Hayward and got 55 wins while missing a max player for the entire season."
"I get that the celtics weren't great, but they have an all-nba star player in Tatum, an all-defensive player in Marcus Smart, a 17 ppg+ player in Fournier, a serviceable center in Thompson and despite his injuries, an actual NBA player in Kemba Walker.  How is that a g-league roster."
I could totally see Marcus smart slapping the shit out of bill
I’ve been saying it since the bubble series vs Miami - I think he’s a pretty shitty coach offensively. The shine has def worn off. Not sure what he does well as a coach tbh. That ECF last year was all isos and Marcus Smart threes. It was dreadful to watch. Not sure exactly how much better he’s gonna do in this new position…
"Context is a thing y'know. Kawhi was a one year rental that had a small chance of paying off (and only did so in Toronto because of the Warrior's injuries). The alternative was to run it back with a team that had just made the ECF and was adding Gordon Hayward and Kyrie (who missed the post-season) to the mix.   Meanwhile AD made it abundantly clear he DID NOT want to play in Boston, and did everything in his power to dissuade us from trading for him. And are we really gonna bring up Harden? He's a title favourite in Brooklyn because he's playing with KD and Kyrie lmfao. He comes to Boston via trade and it's him, Tatum and maybe Marcus Smart; after that it's scrub central.  OP is right, the «almost» narrative is unreal and needs to die. Adding Horford in 2016, Kyrie and Hayward in 2017 WAS the move. It just didn't work, that's what happens sometimes. People act like basketball is some exact science, when sometimes shit just doesn't come through how you want it to."
The window of Conference Finals berths Marcus Smart was talking about in this quote
"You can pretty easily argue all of those points.  &gt; Coming away with only Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, and Carsen Edwards in 2019 while simultaneously trading away Matisse Thybulle.  It should be pretty obvious after last night that Romeo Langford is going to be a good player in this league.  Edwards was a 2nd rounder and Williams was pick #22 which usually amounts to not much in this league.  As for Thybulle - what would the Celtics have even done with him?  He's utterly useless on offense and they already have Marcus Smart- any Smart/Thybulle lineup would be a disaster.  &gt; Not trading Morris and Rozier at the 2019 trade deadline and letting them walk for nothing  This doesn't even make much sense.  Nobody was giving up a fortune for free agents to be and the Celtics are precisely the kind of team that would generally be looking to acquire these guys.  &gt; Not trading the highly valued Kings and Grizzlies picks for anything &gt; Trading away the pick that became Desmond Bane for 2 2nd rounders  These aren't bad decisions so much as coin flip calls.  &gt; Letting Kyrie, Horford, and Hayward walk for virtually nothing  No choice on Kyrie, Horford got overpaid and that's not Ainge's fault, and they got the massive TPE for Hayward.  &gt; Signing Kemba Walker, an aging undersized inefficient PG, to a max contract  This is again a hindsight issue due to his knee going south.  At the time the signing was 100% justifiable and universally applauded.  &gt; Using the MLE on Tristan Thompson  Really don't see the issue here.  He's a great postseason player and gave them a dimension they needed.  You're really not going to do much better than TT on an MLE."
But could Marcus Smart bang Lebron's mom?
Who’s be the filler? Would Marcus Smart be in there?
It all about when they signed their contracts. The market dictates a player’s salary after all so if Marcus Smart signs for 20 mil then any player of his caliber asking prices becomes that number. All the players mentioned signed their contracts years ago so they are about 2-3 years behind of salary inflation. If they were free agents right now they would get the same money as Gordon.
"Spida, Marcus smart, Tatum, jalen brown and gobert"
Marcus Smart
Marcus Smart   Tobias Harris   Aaron Gordon  Julius Randle   Robert Williams
We should have just signed marcus smart to a 4 year/76 million dollar deal. Isn’t that what he was suggesting?
I think Id much rather have Marcus Smart
Marcus smart can’t guard the 1-5. We put AG on Dame in the playoffs and he was the only one with any success
"I mean, that's the narrative that's been thrown around after the high-profile LeBron, Harden, KD, etc. moves  But once you look past those few examples, you have Steph Curry, Bradley Beal, Damian Lillard, Kyle Lowry, Giannis, Gobert, Embiid, Marcus Smart, KAT, all guys who have been on their teams for quite a long time and/or have signed long contract extensions that will likely keep them at the same team for several years.  That's just off the top of my head. Tim Duncan and Kobe only retired what, 5 seasons ago? And Nowitzki in 2019.  Udonis Haslem is still on the Heat's roster.  And the NBA has been incredibly cold and cutthroat at times in other eras.  Jerry Krause cut Phil Jackson loose from the Bulls after he won 6 championships. The Bulls also locked Scottie Pippen into an incredibly low-value contract and refused to renegotiate when the salary rules changed the year after his contract was signed.  And players forcing trades happened in other eras too: Dominique Wilkins refused to play in Utah and forced a trade.  Stephon Marbury demanded a trade out of Minnesota when he didn't get along with KG. Kareem demanded a trade to L.A. because he thought Milwaukee was too small of a stage for him.  Ultimately I don't actually think the NBA is fundamentally very different for the vast majority of players.  There have always been top players who used their leverage over teams, and there have always been teams who didn't look out for their players unless it was convenient.  The main difference now is that it's all happening on social media and everyone's *constantly* talking about it."
Now make Marcus Smart 6'9. He'd be close to a max player no?
Marcus Smart.
Paying a guy 23m a year to play good (but not great) defense and average 10ppg is not a good move.  Marcus Smart gives you all of that along with good playmaking and better defense and only signed for 19m a year.  It's an overpay
Marcus Smart &gt; Ben Simmons
Outside of OKC this is literally Harden's first time playing less that 68 games. Harden was in the MVP conversation before he got injured. Before his injury reignited he put up some of his best games ever against the Celtics: 40.5/10/7 on 61/58/92 and 37/10/10 on 59/57/91. He ended up with shooting splits of 56/48/91 for the series against Marcus Smart. People saw a disabled man putting his career on the line to support his team and forget how he was playing the best playoff basketball of his life in terms of efficiency before he got injured.
"I'm actually steering into the skid on this one: the Ben Simmons slander hasn't gone *far enough*.  He happily signed a max deal in Philly to be their franchise guy and hasn't worked on or improved his game at all since coming into the league.  He wants all the credit &amp; benefits of being a franchise guy but isn't willing to do what it takes to earn that.  With great power comes great responsibility.  If Ben was getting paid Tacko Fall money, nobody would give a shit that he's extremely fragile and has serious limitations, but he isn't so he rightfully gets held to a different standard.  It's not unreasonable for fans &amp; media members to expect NBA players to work hard, doubly so for ""franchise cornerstones.""  Ben can't have it both ways, if he wants to be a ""young socialite"" in a major media market then he has to deal with the scrutiny that comes with that.  If he wants to be loved &amp; coddled and have a team just be happy to have him for who he is, then go to fucking Sacramento, Portland, Minneapolis or somewhere like that (no shots at those cities, typically the media in small markets are less intense).     The way he handles himself &amp; approaches his craft is laughable, and it shows on the court where he spends more time standing flat-footed as a giant, sucking negative than he does doing anything impactful on the court.  People want to say that he could be like Draymond Green which is insanely fucking disrespectful to Draymond Green.  Dray may not shoot a lot (but he IS willing to take them when he needs to), but that dude cuts, screens, scraps and fights for everything and worked his ass off to maximize his abilities.  Draymond is always locked in and is useful in the half-court, Ben Simmons doesn't do anything except stand in the dunker's spot (or out of bounds) and his effort &amp; focus fluctuates wildly.  Miss me with Ben Simmons, I've said it before &amp; will say it again: I wouldn't trade Marcus Smart for him straight up.  Ben Simmons is the most overrated player in the NBA bar none."
Not sure why OP keeps saying in the replies that marcus smart isn’t a valid answer because he “can’t shoot”… which is just abhorrently false
"Marcus Smart has the D, but not the 3. Also what’s the argument for Bridges over OG?"
1.Mikal Bridges   2. OG Anunoby   3 Marcus Smart   4. Robert Covington   5. PJ Tucker
Marcus Smart should probably be on there.
"If Myles Turner is on the list, Marcus Smart has to be too."
A man named Marcus smart. FastPP. They have players capable of play making
If this guy could be a Marcus Smart/Fred VanVleet level impact player a *few years down the line* we’d be very happy.   I think that is around his ceiling but it’s a bit premature to say anything definitive about a player who is basically entering his actual sophomore year playtime wise.
"Kyrie aint kyrie without AI in the league.  How quickly the past fades away for us. Perhaps Kyrie is ""better"" as you say, ok so he is.  AI played in a different era, where it was possible to play how he did and he crushed it.  But in sports, stats aren't everything.  There is no stat for Kyrie being a kook and teammates probably liking AI more or the fact Iverson had the balls to try to lead a team by himself against the likes of Kobe and Shaq, one of the most insane duos the L has ever seen, where as Kyrie needs 2 of the top 5-10 players in the league to team up with.  Iverson took a JV squad to the finals at the helm, Kyrie with the celts made the playoffs 1 out of two years and got bounced in the second rounds having baller teammates like, marcus smart, al horford, jayson tatum, jaylen brown plus a good coach.  Different players, different times.  Both hoopers.  Both got solid shoes too."
Marcus Smart getting Harden to commit *two* offensive fouls in the last 10 seconds: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a4CnOtVn0U
"Lol I remember in the 2014 draft I wanted the Celtics to take Vonleh at 6, we ended up taking Marcus smart and I didn’t like the pick because we had Rondo who was my favorite player. Well now Marcus Smart is my favorite player, how things change"
"That's not giving 110%, that's just a terrible mental lapse by not being aware of the shot clock situation. [Similar to the Marcus Smart one here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeWidtVTW-g) or even the JR one in 2018."
Marcus Smart
"Fun fact, since Trae Young has been in the league, Marcus Smart has a higher 3pt% than him."
"I've never read so many words yet so little actual content in my life before.  Literally nothing was actually said about why Marcus Smart is good, or why the Celtics should keep him."
&gt;	Marcus Smart is rare. Marcus Smart is that one guy that keeps the classic 90s NBA vibes alive. He has that motor that many NBA players simply don’t have.  this sounds like the used car seller i talked to
"Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart"
"Thanks for helping me understand the PnR more 👍🏽   Aside from that, I hope Smart can rediscover the form that made him an elite PnR defender, Marcus if you ever read this I love you the only stat that matters is the W"
That's easy for you to say cause Marcus Smart has improved his game
"I stand by Marcus Smart, flaws and all until he’s off the Celtics."
"i think the biggest problem is they've lacked any real consistency, especially outside of Jaylen Brown and Tatum.  in 2020 Hayward and Kemba got big minutes and a ton of shot attempts when they played, but they could not be at all relied on to play regularly.  Kemba was the same way last year to an even worse degree.  due to injuries and covid, the celtics have had a bunch of lineups where the second best scorer/ball handler is marcus smart, who really shouldn't be a top-2 option on offense (i love him but that's not playing to his strengths).  and if its not him, its probably someone way worse/more inexperienced like brad wannamaker or romeo langford.  i think if they can just get consistency from their role players they can actually start to run a real offensive system, which they haven't really had in years.  in terms of personnel, this is the best i've felt about a celtics roster since they traded for Kyrie and signed Hayward (but before Hayward broke his leg)."
There’s just something about Boston’s offense that I find off for the past 2 seasons  This maybe a simplified version but this is how I saw it.   Tatum ISO Jaylen ISO Kemba ISO Jaylen catch and shoot  Marcus Smart “random 3” Failed PnR with Theis or Williams
"his cold streaks are obviously quite notorious, but sometimes marcus smart gets hot and looks like the best player in the nba.  he had a game a couple years ago where he put up 37/8/5 and hit **11** threes.  he is truly an enigma.  if you look at the list for most three pointers made in a single game, it is a bunch of ELITE shooters/players, and Marcus Smart: https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/who-has-the-most-3-pointers-in-a-game"
Marcus Smart
Boston. I trust him to run the offense more than Marcus Smart and Dennis Shroder. If he can buy into being the main facilitator role and less iso then he can compliment Brown and Tatum and Horford and Rob Williams nicely
Steven Adams   PJ Tucker   Jusuf Nurkic   Morris twins   Marcus Smart   Jimmy Butler   Jonas Valanciunas
marcus smart comes to mind but i don’t actually think he’ll win one.
"marcus smart, the “most threes in a single game by a celtic” record holder lmaoo"
"Between your username and the fact that you’re previously called Marcus Smart the most overrated player in the nba, I have a feeling this is being posted with an agenda."
Don’t worry bro. Marcus smart will call your mom back one of these days.
Ahh yes Marcus Smart is a high profile flopper what does this have to do with Chandler's attempted murder caught on live tv.
"Jayson Tatum.  He's trash compared to people's opinion of him, especially Celtics fans. He takes bad shots And a lot of them. He doesn't create good looks for his team mates. He takes away team mates opportunities. He's far too inconsistent, which again hurts the team, is he gonna shoot 3/20 tonight and get blown out by the Bulls, hit 3/15 and lose to the Wizards or go 20/30 and beat the Nets, who knows just roll a dice. Guess his teammates just hope Tatum pops off? Cause they aren't getting enough ball to get any rhythm going if he doesn't.  The more the Celtics rely on Tatum, and the less they have other players on court taking and creating shots the worse they do. I swear the Celtics roster should perform better every season, but they do worse year on year.  I also think that the way Tatum plays, he makes the players around him worse, like the opposite of the CP3 effect. Like for example, Evan Fornier joins the team and goes from scoing 19ppg to 13ppg despite the fact his shooting percentages went up. On the flip side, Thies had the opposite effect, he moved to the Bulls and his PPG went up, despite his 2pt% staying the same and his 3pt% going down... Look at everyone else who joined this team? Tristan Thompson went from 12ppg to 7ppg, Kemba went from 26ppg to 19ppg. Who could forget scary Terry? MF went from 9ppg to 20ppg. No player has joined this team and gotten better and all of them who left suddenly improved and everyone acts like it's a God damn mystery. Everyone just forgot the fact Rozier got a massive pay day? Dude looked great, but just never got his chance, and guess what he balled out when he was given the chance. If it wasn't predictable why did the Hornets pay him so much and let Kemba walk?   As Tatum's usage rate goes from 10% to 30%, the Celtics go from a Win % of 70% to 50%... Despite what everyone expected was to be the Celtics getting stronger every season due to their high draft stock and already strong roster with guys like Brown, Smart, Irving/Walker, while the team had Hayward on the roster taking the bulk of the salary space AND being out with injury.  He's a great player, with great potential, but his game has major floors which need to be fixed. He's an above average player, on an okay team. But jesus people suck him off like he's in MVP contention despite only going 36-36 with a very decent surrounding cast.   Like if you said to me 2 years ago, there will be a team with: Kemba Walker, Marcus Smart, an All NBA calibur player, Jaylen Brown, Tristan Thompson starting and a bench of Fornier, Teague,  Parker, Williams and Thies, I'd say holy shit that's a top 4 team. But no just 7th in the East, 36-36 record. What?"
Until this year it was Marcus Smart.
I don’t see how that’s awful for Boston. Boston should believe they can develop Davion into a short Marcus Smart and he’s on a cheaper deal then they’re getting multiple Kings picks which could become quite valuable on top of that. That’s low key a steal for the Celtics. As for the Sixers Smart isn’t worth missing out on Mitchell and multiple potential top 10 picks.
"So let’s throw all the cap issues out the window. You’re telling me  - that Marcus Smart and multiple picks is worth Davion Mitchell? I doubt either team likes that deal  - that Philadelphia sacrifices multiple potential lottery picks so they can get Marcus Smart? Smart isn’t worth that much  - that the Kings give up Hield, Bagley, Mitchell and a lot of picks to get Simmons and picks most likely in the 20s. That’s too much for Simmons’ current value  And then ofc Smart can’t be traded rn and that’s actually too much salary for the Sixers."
"Not a star, but Marcus Smart with league average shot selection lo"
"Yeah, like hell, even before Marcus Smart became a good three point shooter he would still take open ones. You have to keep the defense honest, even if it doesn't go in most of the time it opens the floor up because they know that you will shoot."
"Lmfao Pelicans contending? Hornets? Why would they trade for Dragic?   Lakers with who? They trading 12 of their minimum contracts for one Dragic?   Hawks with who? They trading their promising rookies for old Dragic? 😂  Celtics with who? They trading Marcus Smart for Dragic? Horford for Dragic?   Jazz with who? Conley for Dragic? Ingles for Dragic? Boggy for Dragic? Jordan Clarkson for Dragic? lmfao  Clippers with who? Marcus Morris? Maybe they’ll trade Kawhi for Dragic 😂 or maybe Raptors take Bledsoe for Dragic right? 😂 or Luke Kennard lmao  Look at those teams and they don’t have any guys that would match up to trade for Dragic without giving up contributing players / promising rookies  Again, you sound stupid."
"did you miss his 2.0 per game vs the Sixers in 2019 or how he shot like a drunk Marcus Smart in 2020 when they lost to the C's.   He had some good games, but has been really bad alot too.   He also has never had to shoulder the load that Ben did."
"His value is still trash. Hayward is not and will not be the same player he was which *included* upwards trajectory.   Ingram and Brown were the pivotal pieces unless you actually believe that Tatum was on the table (he wasn't) and Boston didn't want to take the risk of losing Brown + picks and filler when there's a chance that AD doesn't re-sign.   Also AD being on the market wasn't new. If they wanted a longer rental, Ainge could have been making godfather offers for a long time. The trade deadline excuse was dumb. That's when Davis himself asked for a trade. That doesn't mean he wasn't available prior to that. Every player is available unless they have a NTC. And really, even then, you can convince them to waive it.   Ainge consistently tried to significantly underpay for talent with his assets and ended up having to actually draft players. And when he did draft he essentially hit twice over 27 picks. Three times if you count Marcus Smart."
He probably found the one stat in which marcus smart is better than him
"How is 10 feet at the rim? 0-3 feet is normally used  he shoots 57.2% from 0-3 feet, Marcus Smart shoots 51.2% from 0-3 feet"
"&gt; Lots of freshman and sophomores have had his level of success  Name freshman other than Kevin Durant and Michael Beasley that have.  &gt;By those measurements he was not even top 10 within the year he played  Do you mean players in the country? That basically never happens for freshmen in P5, especially not if you aren't playing on Kentucky/Duke/Gonzaga/a powerhouse school at the time.  &gt;Someone like Zion the next year was an actual all-time dominating force in college  Playing at a powerhouse with pretty much an entire roster better than the 2nd best player on Trae's team.  &gt;Trae is only an all-time talent if you count exclusively by raw point and assist totals and ignore literally everything else.  Yes, volume and situation both actually matter lmao.  The list of players with Trae's intersection of volume, situation, and efficiency is incredibly small.   Zion played on one of the most talented teams in the country under the best college coach of all-time, on a team that cranks out hyperefficient seasons on a regular basis. Zion was a notch above their typical hyperefficiency, but Marvin Bagley was 21/11 on 64.3% TS, and Jahlil Okafor was 17/8.5 on 64.1% TS.  Like you've done multiple times already, you completely miss the significance of the landscape of college basketball.   &gt;58% TS is good but not amazing for college.  27.4ppg on 58.5% TS is absurd lmao, its literally mind-meltingly good. That's why I wanted you to look up all the previous top PG draft picks so you could grasp how much of an outlier Trae's production was.   Lonzo Ball: 14.6ppg  De'Aaron Fox: 16.7ppg  Ben Simmons: 19.2ppg  D'Angelo Russell: 19.3ppg  Marcus Smart(soph): 18ppg  Victor Oladipo(junior): 13.6ppg  Damian Lillard(senior in non-P5): 24.5ppg  Kyrie Irving(11 games): 17.5ppg  John Wall: 16.6ppg  Tyreke Evans(non-P5): 17.1ppg  Steph Curry(junior, non-P5): 28.6ppg  Derrick Rose(non-P5): 14.9ppg  Russell Westbrook: 12.7ppg  The only PG close to Trae's volume was Curry, and he did it as a Sophomore and Junior in a non-P5 conference. Trae doing it on great efficiency on top of it is ridiculous.   Doing what Trae did as a freshman in the P5 on a non-powerhouse is as close as it gets to outright unheard of. The only comparables are Beasley and Durant.    &gt;Many guys are regularly well over 60% even on high volume.  Not Guards, not Freshmen, not on Trae's volume, not in the Power 5, and not at non-powerhouse schools.   &gt;Also, Trae’s TS% was hugely uplifted by shooting a ton of free throws, which is another thing many college guys struggle to bring over to the NBA.  That's the opposite of true. FT attempts are one of the stickiest stats, if not the actual stickiest from college to the NBA. Rim attempts and FT attempts are two of the biggest predictors of NBA success and Trae was elite at both."
"It took me longer than I care to admit to realize that OP didn’t mean smart Kyrie, as if that’s some mythical player like Game 6 Klay, and that he meant Marcus Smart."
"“I can name 15-20 PGs who are better defensively than Curry.”  Then why’d you have to bring in shooting guards?  Some of the people you named are legitimately terrible defenders.  Schroeder is a Celtic so now you’re gonna pretend he’s not one of the worst PG defenders in basketball?  Kyrie is terrible and you had some tired homer bullshit about him being “good when he’s locked in”.  I should stop responding now that it’s clear you’re a serious, serious Celtic homer.  But here are some more who aren’t better than Steph on defense, and I’m just kinda surprised at how random your list seemed to recruit bad defenders from strange places, even the bench.  Fox (dude…), Neto, Dinwiddie (seriously, what lol?), Jevon Carter (you don’t get to say a man who comes in for 12 mins a game and guards backups is an elite defender).  Then you have combo guards like Jrue, Caruso, Kris Dunn etc.  only Jrue can really be considered a point here.  Then you have people like Josh Hart, KCP and Marcus Smart who are absolutely not point guards.  You clearly exaggerated and your weird defensive appraisals here are all over the map and often wrong.  You couldn’t name 15-20 PGs who were better even when you got rookies and shooting guards."
"[Marcus Smart](https://www.si.com/nba/2021/05/27/marcus-smart-kyrie-irving-boston-celtics-fans-racist-comments) talked about it a few months ago. I know you're being sarcastic, but unfortunately yes, Boston is racist as shit and the players know it. [Bill Russell](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2899150-bill-russell-fans-called-me-baboon-coon-n-word-during-celtics-games) knew it, too. [Boston racism in basketball](https://celticswire.usatoday.com/2020/02/29/celtics-discuss-racial-dynamics-still-play-boston/) is honestly a pretty popular topic that seems to keep coming up all the time. Same as Utah.   Honestly your comment reeks of ""But I have a black friend"" energy. You're saying that Boston was nice to one black guy, so how could they be racist? I bet Tacko Fall and any other black player would be able to explain to you all about it."
"Yes.  The Rock is like... 6'4"" and ripped which would make him just big enough to play Marcus Smart in a movie..."
"I didn't like Marcus Smart in college, but came around when he got drafted and started playing for us."
I'd like him to just turn into Marcus Smart.
Marcus Smart
Hold on… Marcus? As in Marcus Smart? You think the Celtics should/will retire Marcus Smart’s jersey?
"Marcus Smart is in the Draymond category of “hate him when he’s against you, love him when he’s for you”  Like I hate him so much but he’d be my favorite player on the Lakers"
"#Marcus Smart and filler for Simmons and a pick.  I think a guy like Smart is the best case scenario for the 76ers. A guy who approximates one or more of Simmons' best qualities (running the break/defense--in Smart's case, just defense), excels where Simmons' is weak (Smart is not hesitant to shoot...at all) but also is weak where Simmons' excels (he's not 6'10"").   I would take a swing on Simmons for Smart. I think Simmons would thrive if he wasn't expected to be guy 1A or 1B. It'd be Tatum, Brown, Simmons with all locked up for a good number of years.   It'd allow the C's to switch almost 1-5 (not sure what the lineups will be) with no issues at all.   Worst case we crash and burn, but I think Simmons' gives us a higher ceiling than Smart."
Def but OP mention guys like Marcus Smart and Udonis Haslem for his examples. Middleton is tiers above those guys.
No way in hell is Marcus Smart getting his number retired without some major accolades
Marcus Smart is one of my favorite players as well... But I still irrationally hate the Celtics
"Marcus Smart, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, 2 unprotected firsts, plus salary filler"
"I'm the total opposite. I used to like him and thought of him in the same general way people think of Marcus Smart (i.e., annoying if he's on the other team, but a great hustle guy &amp; teammate if he's on your team). This past playoffs really turned me off of him though, not just for the two CP3 pushes but also because I realized that his entire game seems to be him just leveraging his willingness to injure somebody. Like, he stresses the hell out of whoever he's guarding (except Luka), but I feel like it's not because the other player is bothered by his actual defensive ability; they're stressed because they have to work around all the reckless shit he's doing that could lead to them breaking their nose or spraining their ankle and being out for the game or longer."
Marcus smart
"I used to hate anything Celtics related but now one of my favorite players is Marcus Smart, just such a hard worker and defensive menace. Would give anything to have him in Miami with our core"
And the Celtics got gifted every call for pretty much all of the series. Literally shot 15 free throws in the fourth quarter of a one point game seven off of dumb Marcus smart flops and had an insane free throw discrepancy.
Most compared to Joe Johnson and Marcus Smart
"Yes for this year, and probably next summer you will keep the same core of players and see who fits and who doesn't. But after 2 seasons a lot of decisions are going to be made that break up the 7 guys you're talking about, that's not really my opinion that's just how the league works. I just looked this up for another comment, here's what today's rosters look like compared to the start of the 19/20 season for teams in the east. The stars like Embiid, Tatum, and Butler clearly stay on their teams. Here are your non star players still on the team from the 19/20 rosters  Sixers have Shake, Tobias, and Thybulle. Celtics have Grant Williams and Marcus Smart. Bucks have Lopez, Connaughton, and Thanasis. Heat have Robinson, Herro, and Haslem. Iggy counts but he left so it's still roster turnover. Go 3 seasons back and it's 2 rotation players AT MOST for all these teams.  Only looking at your cap sheet you simply cannot pay all your guys. A few will definitely still be around, but you're talking about 6 players here in Cam, DeAndre, Heuter, Capela, Okongwu, and Collins. In 2-3 years you'll probably only have 2, maybe 3 still around. This is all assuming you don't go out and try to trade for a star to pair with Trae. The sixers, Bucks, Heat, and Celtics already went through this, I know it feels like you can grow naturally but when Cam, and DeAndre are up for extensions in 2 years next to Trae and John Collins making 25+ you're just going to lose some due to FA or trades. I don't think I'm being unrealistic at all, I mean you straight can't afford those 7 players in 2 years."
"It's more of a 3 year cycle than a 2 year cycle but when you're building a contender around a young player usually only a few players stick around who aren't the stars. Now they just locked up a good number of these guys but you can't pay everyone once the other extensions kick in. Just looking in the east and comparing the starting day 19/20 rosters with todays' rosters, Sixers, Celtics, Bucks, and Heat only have like 3-5 guys total still on the team and that includes the stars who obviously stick around. Sixers only have Shake, Tobias, and Thybulle still around from that team. Celtics only have Grant Williams and Marcus Smart, Bucks only have Lopez, Connaughton, and Thanasis"
VanVleet is kind of a fluke that's hard to project from because he has absolutely freakish core strength that makes him functionally a lot bigger than his height on defense. Think Marcus Smart
Marcus Smart
Marcus Smart - every soccer player ever.
It happened with Kyrie in Boston. For a few weeks at the start of his second season he was running around on D trying to do Marcus Smart things. A few articles were written about how he was becoming a good defender.   Once that narrative started… he went back to being the guy opposing teams point guards got their career high against.
"I disagree, i don’t think ben Simmons will ever be a good shooter no matter how hard he works on it. He’s just bad at it, that said him being more aggressive on offense and being a competent free throw shooter is much more in the realm of reality.   For every Marcus smart, theres an Andre Roberson"
"Celtics fans watched Marcus smart somehow will himself from being a historically bad shooter to ""sporadically and unreliably good"" over the years by just refusing to be afraid to take shots. And smart never had the cushion and security of being an expensive #1 draft pick to let him know he wouldn't get his ass traded or benched for bricking away like Simmons did."
ie marcus smart
Frank can be a Marcus Smart type guy in his prime
"Marcus Smart is my favourite player. I’ll give him a pass on this, but damn it was a total brain fart.   Put it up there with Westbrook walking with the ball."
"Yeah this Marcus Smart guy might be the best perimeter defender of our generation,but this one time he caused the team to lose two points in a meaningless regular season game,so I think he’s probably a net negative"
Lol Smart’s the one Celtic I feel comfortable saying Kyrie loved being on a team with. He was the one one who Kyrie would consistently compliment when speaking to the media. He’d bring up Smart’s importance to the team completely unprompted and once said the he would “watch Marcus Smart highlights” in  his “downtime”. I’d point to basically anyone else on the roster as a reason Kyrie left before I got to Smart.
Marcus smart slanders will not be tolerated
"This guy was like budget marcus smart  6'3"" 220 with 6'10"" wingspan and really strong"
I have the 2021 Bucks in mind for this team makeup  Marcus Smart - 2nd playmaker/Defense  Joe Harris - Spacer  Joe Ingles - Spacer/Playmaker  LeBron  Jarrett Allen - Lob Threat/Boards
Marcus Smart falls into this group
Just be Marcus Smart
"Marcus Smart also up there for Giannis, somehow."
Evan Fournier and Marcus Smart
"Marcus Smart for any guard up there. In particular Mitchell, and Book and Trae"
&gt;Marcus Smart is a high IQ player  Relevant username
If Draymond was Marcus Smart he would’ve chucked up 10 3s every 10 games or so and sometimes randomly decide to hit 7 of them.
For me nothing will top Marcus Smart trying to batista bomb two make-a-wish kids while diving for a ball going out of bounds
Marcus Smart just got ejected somewhere
"In January I offered Marcus smart for capella, and was counter offered Clint for Smart and Wendell Carter, and turned it down because I was told by a ""friend"" that if I accepted I'd look ""desperate"". About a week after that and since Clints been leading the league in rebounds."
I feel like Marcus smart would be the best player if that were to happen
"two very different players imo, but thybulle at this second in time is better due to his defensive value  i'm a believer that nesmith's ceiling is, like, buddy hield on offense with marcus smart/patbev defensive effort. he's not incredibly quick with his first step or long so he's definitely capable of being driven by, but he recovers well and plays both very intelligently and hard. never going to be a top defender, but his efforts and overall capabilities on defense will be a plus. it's the offense that is his value imo, especially the shooting. also he's a really nice guy"
"Thompson’s goaltending call last night was so absurdly wrong I can’t believe there hasn’t been an investigation into the refs, it completely changed the tide of the game, a timeout to challenge it was called but the refs outright just said nah you’re not challenging and threw the ball into play, like how do they get away with that.   And the Marcus Smart ejection was them just pissing on us to show off that they can do what they want"
"Goes without saying, but Marcus Smart"
"I know you’re a huge Blazers homer as you’re in this thread like a flailing sausage trying to defend every bad call, but the ejection was a joke. Nurkic moving screen (not falling on Smart) causes the unintentional contact, shouldn’t even be a foul. Let’s not forget earlier in the game when Marcus gets hammered in the head by Powell and it’s a common foul? FOH."

He doesn't have a reputation for hitting guys in the nuts.  Why do people make this shit up?  [He's been hit far more than he's hit anyone else.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/boston.cbslocal.com/2019/11/12/celtics-marcus-smart-would-like-everyone-to-stop-kicking-him-in-the-groin-nba/amp/)
Trae struggles when Marcus Smart is there u idiot. Check the stats then come and try to trash talk. You really think a team that has made the ECF 2 out of the last 3 years would lose to a team that can barely play defense lmao. Gtfoh with that nonsense.
Yep. Hate Smart but dude got done dirty here by  the refs. Moving screens can happen but the refs need to fucking you know not be blind and stupid and call the moving screen as the reason why marcus ending up in that situation.   If we look Marcus is going for a legitimate swipe at the ball on a drop off pass. Totally fair it was a really stupid play by Nurkic why would you droo off there with a man literally on your dude. Smart is going in a straight line and Nurkic literally steps out to impede him after smart has engaged in a bid for that ball. Moving screen from Nurkic 100%. You do dumb shit dumb shit happens to you. Look at Nurkics leg here too. This isn't a screen this is a trip job at the very least. He's juts his left leg out like that. That's not even a proper attempt at a proper moving screen. That's just tripping somebody.    TLDR fuck smart but Nurkic is an idiot and the refs suck same IQ as Kyle Kuzma - Smart got screwed over by the refs here.
"Idk if people are arguing about the fact that the ref wasn't looking at Luka or if the call is bad or what. We have peripherals so ref could easily have seen Luka, and for the call itself.... It's a legitimate call. You actually see JJ try and grab Luka from going in that direction but JJs half-hearted attempt also either speaks loud or quiet. Pure speculation but JJs half hearted attempt was bc he didn't think the ref would actually call it or JJ didn't actually think Luka would actually step inside.    Either way if we're being completely objective, forget all feelings  Luka fucked up. Refs probably a bitch but here Luka fucked up and JJs attempt at grab + lack of response from the vet player to that call speaks mega loud. Just stay outside the lane idk why that's so tough. It's a basic rule. Just be smart but not marcus smart dudes a dick."
Marcus Smart is just plain awful. He needs to stop shooting so much.
"As a die hard Celtics fan, this wasn't about the refs.  Any marcus smart physical play is going to be 50/50 no matter what.  He knows that.  Win some lose some."
I understand everyone that isn't a celtic fan hates Marcus Smart but this was so clearly unintentional. He was chasing after his man at full speed.
Not even the only egregious call. That last minute technical on Marcus smart was stupid as fuck
"I'm with you OP. They see Nurkic on the floor holding his groin, and are like ""we have no idea what could have caused this."" They complain about the review taking too long, which it did, but they didn't even consider the craaaaazy possibility that the guy on the floor holding his nuts could have possibly been hit by Marcus Smart until like 5 whole minutes in when they saw a different angle. I wouldn't even like listening to them if I was a Boston fan"
"i’m completely unbiased (in fact Blazers are probably my 2nd favorite team after the dubs) and i can say that looked completely inadvertent. Smart got clobbered by Nurkic throwing his hip into him, and was actually looking the other direction from where his left arm hit.. it would take some insanely quick reaction time and accuracy for Smart to intentionally hit Nurk in the balls here   the only people i see in these threads saying this was intentional are Blazers fans. I know Smart can be dirty and I can’t believe I’m siding with him here, but that was an awful call. If you set an illegal screen and throw your unprotected crotch at Marcus Smart before he has time to move out of the way, then how is it his fault that you get hit by his arm. I mean, Nurk’s crotch is literally at Smart’s arm level.."
Marcus smart getting clobbered in face and having it called a common foul wouldn't have happened in any other game.
I really hate Marcus Smart
Throwback to Marcus Smart trying to [injure Giannis](https://twitter.com/itsjwills/status/1289587941405126656) in the bubble. So on brand for him to take a nut shot at Nurkic and then flop lol.
"Marcus Smart is one of those players you hate but if he was on your team, you’d love to have him - but not me, I love Marcus Smart just the way he is!  Make it happen Masai!"
Marcus Smart dirty play FUCKING classic. Getting fucked on back to back calls.
Incoming Marcus Smart suspended one game for looking at ref funny
"Hopefully Masai can make some big moves for Marcus Smart in the offseason, I just think he’s so good and I love streaky shooters!"
Marcus Smart must be feeling himself if he decided to do an ISO lol
Very random but I’d be interested in seeing the %s nba players shoot on those type of 3s Marcus smart took right as Brad called the TO. After a whistle when it’s wide open with no pressure. I bet the % made would be lower than people expect
Very tired of Marcus smart shooting threes especially when there’s plenty of time on the shot clock
Marcus Smart probably doesn't drink water damn you should let him know
not sure why the Blazers are double-teaming marcus fucking smart
Marcus Smart turned into Mickey Mouse Stephen Curry
Nothing but respect for marcus smart continuing to have terrible skin despite being a multi-millionaire. makes those of us still with terrible skin as adult men who are very much not multi-millionaires feel better 😂
"Dame maybe you wouldn't have fallen if you didn't throw your head back like that lmao, the Marcus Smart Special"
"I agree. He’s average at scoring at best but he’s above average playmaker and a great defender. I’d liken him to something between Marcus Smart and Rajon Rondo. In between them in passing, defending, and probably a better rebounder than both."
"You're joking? Leaving aside Klay with injury, there's still Jae Crowder, Marcus Smart, mikal bridges, Covington, Danny green, OG Anunoby off the top of my head."
"I feel like Marcus Smart should be here, even tho he only shoots around 33% from 3"
"That would be sweet, but Marcus smart is already pretty damn good. How often do you have an all-defense point guard with good ball handling and play making?   Although I could be severely overvaluing his offense, I haven’t really watched him that much."
still holding out hope for Marcus Smart to make a leap and get on the all star team
He suffers from Andre Drummond and Marcus Smart syndrome where he thinks he’s a lot better than he is and takes terrible shots and makes low IQ plays but it’s way worse cause he’s way less skilled than those 2
"Unfortunately, 6th Man has typically boiled down to how prolific a scorer you are off the bench. Just isn't as sexy to the media to vote for a defense-first guy off the bench, else you might've seen Marcus Smart take one the last few years.  I feel like he might push for a DPOY eventually though."

Give him a few more years I can see him being a younger Marcus Smart. Maybe flip smart for a solid bench piece by then
raps fan here. marcus smart similarly took years off my life in games 1 &amp; 2. dude turned into reggie miller.  lol nonetheless what a classic series. nurse-stevens both coached their asses off it was so fun to watch.
Just wow! Celtics have been my favorite not-my-team team for a few years now and Tatum has really solidified that. Marcus Smart and others and their grit and play style really make me love to root for them.  As a guy with limited time I always follow the box score to see if I need to tune in :)
Tatum with 60!!!!!!  Naismith doing Marcus Smart things
"and before that, the bogus foul on Marcus Smart who literally was standing still with his arms straight up in the air...  We can go back and forth all night, the refs sucked and bad calls were made for BOTH sides."
"Giving off Marcus ""Winning Plays"" Smart vibes the past 2 games"
We’re 100% going to hear about how Marcus Smart rushed himself back this year and never actually got healthy during this offseason
"Yeah a lineup of  PG: Dame  SG: Marcus Smart  SF: Jaylen Brown  PF: Jayson Tatum  C: Tim Duncan   Could be absolutely absurd on both ends of the court. The worst guy is Smart and he completely covers for Dames weakness as a defender. The only hole would be if teams tried to go big and attack Tatum, but that would almost definitely cause more problems for them trying to cover Tatum than it would for the Celtics since Tatum could easily beat almost any PF big enough to create a mismatch and could honestly still probably hold his own defensively."
I really hope you wrote this knowing full well Marcus Smart is your #1 player
Devin Booker hung 70 on Marcus Smart but that game is apparently a stain on his resume lol
Marcus smart has not been an all defense 1st team this year...
Marcus smart deserves a mention if jimmy butler gets 1
"Curry could easily have 4 more seasons where he could be the best player on a championship team, remember the elite of the elite just age different. Until Steve Nash had that injury when he was like 37 he was nearly as effective as ever.   But in any case you don't move the picks for Marcus Smart and OG Anonuby or whatever package you think you make. Because which top players are going to be available next season?   Warriors are moving a top 5 pick or Wiseman for rotation pieces, they just aren't going to do that."

Marcus Smart giveth Marcus Dumb taketh away.
Imagine how good the Celtics will be when they get Marcus Smart back
Need to save this for when people ask me why I love Marcus Smart so much
Marcus smart doesn't have the ability to be a generational talent and he's not publically limiting his own development lol
Lol Marcus Smart just got suspended. Worry about your own team.
"As long as it isn't hugely detrimental to his career, I *REALLY* want headcase Marcus Smart in the NBA. I want the guy who'll fight a fan. I want the guy who'll motherfuck an official. I want a guy who'll flop on the biggest play of the game and draw the foul then smile at the camera. I fuckin love headcase Marcus Smart."
"&gt;might just have been the best defensive SG in the league  I wasn't trying to disrespect him, I wasn't implying all he is is a reliable shooter, just meant with a 2nd reliable shooter in general things would be different. But you're overselling his defense. He's great on ball  but best defense in the league at his position? Absolutely not. He's a bad off-ball defender and I do mean bad, I don't just mean average (people point to Steph's poor defense as to why Klay always covers the other teams primary guard, but this is another reason. It utilizes both players best defensive abilities. Steph's better off ball than he is in ball and Klay is better on ball than he is off ball) and he barely generates any turnovers. There might not be a better on-ball defender than him (which is debatable) but as for overall, yeah there's better. Nobody is going to take Klays defense over someone like Jimmy or Marcus Smart"
"I personally have him as top 5-6 yeah, and that’s depending on if you’re counting players like Dort or Marcus Smart."
"Melton is approaching that Marcus Smart/PatBev defensive tier. If he was on a contender, we'd be hearing so much about him. And shoutout to Desmond Bane, who's been getting more love lately but is still underrated."
"I agree with you on everything. I look forward to PG getting some big defensive stops in the playoffs and creating a new defensive narrative. Hopefully even a big defensive stop in crunch time.   I do think you’re underrating Bam’s stop though. He was guarding Marcus Smart in the corner and left him there to rotate over and contest the drive cause Jimmy was beat. That wasn’t Tatum “coming to Bam in position” but more Bam meeting Tatum at the apex.   Good luck to your Clippers though, if that’s your squad, I’m hoping to see the Mavs vs Clippers in the 1st round. That series is gonna be awesome and full of vitriol on both sides, lol. As a neutral observer… I love it."

Who let Marcus Smart shoot 10 3s?   Do we really have no one better that start than Semi?   How did TT get 5 fouls in 18min?  At least my PP was red hot tonight
Yeah this is the issue. Also some of our players get tentative. I’d rather a bad Marcus Smart shot than a 24 second violation and sometimes it feels like those are the only two options
"Marcus Smart is the most important player on the Celtics, but Tatum is the best player. So I wouldn’t say they’re the same thing."
"Just a couple years ago the Celtics had Kyrie, Hayward, Horford, Tatum, Brown, Smart, Theis, Rozier, and also had a huge stockpile of highly coveted draft picks (the Kings pick, the Grizzlies pick foremost among them). It's absolutely astonishing to me how they simply lost or squandered almost all of that so quickly.   This summer Marcus Smart comes up for an extension and my guess is the Celtics won't pay him because to do so would put them in the luxury tax, and their owners aren't gonna pay the tax for a team this bad. To me the Celtics right now are just a clock counting down until both Tatum and Brown make trade demands."
"maybe he did and Marcus Smart wanted to be Marcus Dumb, or Brad didn't trust the team to get a stop, which I somewhat understand tbh"

Marcus Smart is terrible at basketball
I will despise Evan Fournier and Marcus Smart till the day I die. At least Baze had a really nice efficent game but I am upset.
This is the irrational exuberance Marcus Smart game that Bill Simmons always worries about when he's asked to score more 😂
Evan Fournier and Marcus Smart combined for 25 points on 31 shots. Also had 6 turnovers and 9 fouls. Fucking hell
I just wanna shout out Fournier and Marcus smart on behalf of the rest of the east
"Lol at the Marcus Smart comparison 😂  But its true that there weren't many great perimeter defenders in that era that could match MJ's size at 6'6"". The best matchup for him was probably Pippen."
"And having the length, height, and weight advantage in the case of Jordan isn't?  I used Marcus Smart because he was formerly 240 lbs and now seems around 225-230, which would be a similar weight difference to Jordan and Dumars/Payton .  &gt; You WANT Smart, Dumars and guys like that on a quick guard like MJ to stay in front of him.  I can see a 220-230 lb smart on Jordan yes, but in the modern NBA no one is putting a 6'3, 190 lb guy as Jordan's primary defender unless your wing defenders are absolute shit. You would put a Dort, Anunoby, younger Kawhi, Tony Allen, Butler, etc."
Did you really just compare HOF players like Payton and Dumars to Marcus Smart and Eric Bledsoe?
"With the way Jordan played it really did make more sense that the quick lateral guys were able to defend him a lot better than the guys with raw size and physical strength. Comparing how guys guard Lebron doesn’t really work the same, Lebron uses his size a lot differently than Jordan did. Comparing how guys guarded Jordan to how Kobe was guarded fits a bit better in my opinion. Plus comparing Marcus Smart to the Glove is just downright disrespectful lol"
Marcus Smart vs Larry Bird’s left hand. Who wins?
Man that's too easy for Marcus Smart.
How often does marcus smart trash talk you in practice?
"Out of the anti-flop warnings, they could've given this is what they chose to do... I'm not into conspiracies but the NBA sure does seem to hate it that Giannis re-signed with the Bucks. Be it the stupid fine to Horst for saying the Bucks would offer Giannis the supermax, fining us for tampering and ruining the Bogi trade, now this shit.  It's for things that nobody gets ever fined for, too, unless it's the Bucks. Eat a Marcus Smart, Adam Silver."
What is your favorite Marcus Smart story? (On or Off Court)
How do you think effort players like Dennis Rodman or your teammate Marcus Smart should be ranked?
"&gt;this isn't the 80s. Every city has racism.  It doesn't have to be the 80s. Marcus Smart got called the n word by a fan that was wearing a Celtics jersey in Boston. The only other city that players talk about like this is Utah.   &gt;He knows what he was doing.  Yeah. Asking for the fans to not be racist. Seems like a pretty reasonable request.   &gt;He's changing the narrative from being booed for a liar and assclown to ""Boston is racist"". You're so naive if you don't agree with Stephen A here and don't think that's what he's doing.  You're an idiot if you actually believe this."
"After spending roughly 3-5 minutes googling:  https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/marcus-smart-nba-boston-celtics-covid-racial-injustice  https://www.si.com/mlb/2017/05/02/cc-sabathia-adam-jones-boston-fan-racism  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1161561-nhl-playoffs-2012-bruins-fans-unleash-racial-slurs-in-response-to-loss  https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/06/11/red-sox-acknowledge-racism-fenway-park-is-real-promise-action/  May I politely suggest you ""open your eyes""?"
Marcus Smart in his rookie year and Adam Jones at Fenway are two that I can think of
"Plenty of elite defensive point guards could take matchups on 6'7 superstars. Marcus Smart, Rajon Rondo, Jason Kidd, Jrue Holiday."
"&gt; you piece of Marcus Smart  First of all, how dare you"
"Stupid argument because you are talking about player defense vs team defense.  Only two teams with a defense outside of the top 10 has ever won a ring.  And your DPOY argument is beyond moronic.  No one said DPOY = rings.  But being great at defense does.  GOAT list - MJ, LBJ, Magic, Kobe, Shaq, Tim Duncan, Wilt, Kareem, Bird, Moses, Dr J, Hakeem, etc etc etc - have all been named to NBA all defensive teams.  Rudy Gobert or Jokic? Neither have a ring and neither are getting one this year so whats your point?  Both are young enough to still win multiple.    Marcus Smart or Kyrie Irving?  Lebron got Kyrie his ring.  Lebron is first defensive team player.  Ben Simmons or Devon Booker?  Neither have a ring, but Simmons is more likely to get his this year than Booker is.  Tony Allen or Allen Iverson?  AI never got a ring.  Ben Simmons or Luka?  Neither have a ring, but Ben is in a better position to get his this year than Luka is.  Michael Cooper or Magic?  Magic and he was first defensive team... dafaq you smoking on this one nephew?  Bruce Bowen or Steve Nash?  Nash - no ring.  Dennis Rodman or Charles Barkley? No rings vs 2.  Ben Wallace or Dirk?  Obviously dirk, but why this comparison?  Dirk wasn't a Center."
How dare you make me admit that I may be wrong you piece of Marcus Smart
"Marcus Smart was considered a PG when he came into the NBA.  D'Angelo Russell was thought of more as a combo guard, but he was touted enough to be the #2 pick in a loaded draft. I'd say the answer would either be him or Beal, who was touted enough to be the #3 pick in the most hyped draft I can remember since 2003."
"KO can play offense, that's for damned sure. I used to hope he could become a high level playmaking stretch 4 back when I had visions of a 4 out Cs offense surrounding Marcus Smart post ups."
"Yeah, Marcus smart is a true dog. He’s who Beverley thinks he is"

Me but with Marcus Smart currently
"Marcus Smart got suspended one game for hitting Matt Bonner in the nuts, following his ejection:  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/12531595/marcus-smart-boston-celtics-suspended-one-game-low-blow-vs-matt-bonner-san-antonio-spurs  I forget who Smart got like a month ago, but he got ejected for that in the game but was not suspended afterwards.  I thought given the prior offense he might’ve gotten more than one game, even if that was six years ago with no nut shots since."
"""one of the only cities"" where players talk about racism?!  Pointing out that the **NYPD BEAT AND ASSAULTED THABO SEFOLOSHA IN NEW YORK CITY** wasn't whataboutism! Does that count as one of the only cities?  WAKE UP, and recall that the **Milwaukee Police BEAT AND ASSAULTED STERLING BROWN!** How many cities are you excusing here?  Get a clue dude.  You don't know that in the past decade, Boston reoriented law enforcement and made an extremely comprehensive rebuild of their policing strategies; meanwhile, in the same time frame, NY + Milwaukee are literally BEATING AND ASSAULTING NBA PLAYERS UNDER THE COLOR OF LAW.  Stop the ""only 2 cities"" bullshit about Boston &amp; Utah.  This pile-on to Boston having ignorant meanies who say bad words is ridiculous in contrast to the extreme **RACISM ENCODED IN LAW** against Hispanics across New Mexico, YOUR STATE Arizona, and potentially Southern California.  Your Suns play in what might be the epicenter of law-enforced racism in the country. Wanna talk about the border?  A drunk, ignorant lady yelling racial slur at Marcus Smart, is not the same as YOUR BOY Joe Arapaio literally being an extreme racist + international terrorist freed by your racist president from NY."
[Marcus Smart also said that Celtics have the best fans in the world](https://twitter.com/smart_MS3/status/1393045371232915457?s=20)  You see how that works ? Using an isolated incident to generalise and entire city?
"Congrats, Clippers! You *almost* beat a team that shot 54% from the free throw line! At home! As the higher seed! And the only top 4 team in the West without a major injury!  Y'all really tried to make an entire NBA team with two players.  Kawhi really left a championship squad--one that could've potentially repeated AND WAS A MARCUS SMART BLOCK AWAY FROM THE CONFERENCE FINALS EVEN WITHOUT HIM--to play with Paul George and nobody else."
"Wdym I gave two different recent examples, the Marcus Smart one and the Demarcus Cousins one"
that is marcus smart dumbass
"it’s not just the clippers. this is how basketball fans talk about dark skinned players  draymond green “donkey”  marcus smart “bulldog”  vs. facu and delly, the epitome of hard work and effort on the court!"
I'm not denying there have been racist incidents.   I'm saying right now r/nba is in full FTC mode and people are just making shit up because it's an easy way to get upvotes.   Our fanbase 100% has had incidents of racism.  &gt;Maybe he hasn’t experienced the racism because he played for the team?  Even this isn't enough to stop the racism.   Marcus Smart probably has the worst experiences I've heard of among NBA players in Boston over recent years. Both an experience with a fan and an experience with cops.   There is 100% an issue with racism within the broader NBA community and racism within Boston specifically.   However the person I was responding to said:  &gt;he's calling out the storied racism in your city that he's experienced  Kyrie is on the record saying it hasn't happened to him specifically and even in the video today he gets asked if he's experienced it first and he dodges the question.
"&gt; “I yell out the window,” Smart recalled. “ ‘Excuse me, ma’am, you better get out of the street before you and your son get hit. Cars are coming. I don’t want you to get hit.’  &gt; “As soon as I said that, she looked at me – as she is wearing a No. 4, green with the white outline Celtics jersey – and told me, ‘F— you, you f—ing n—–.’ People that actually heard her were stunned. They’re like, ‘That’s Marcus Smart. You just got done watching the game, ma’am … with an Isaiah Thomas jersey on.’ ”  Celtics fan literally called Demarcus Cousins the N Word in 2019   Trying to deflect instead of calling out issues wit racism is part of the problem"
"Gaslighting is a great way to describe it.   Marcus Smart has talked about facing racism in boston and fans *still* don't want to belive it, or say ""oh well! It happens everywhere!"" And I agree about Russel, dude should have been treated like the absolute legend he is and instead the city treated him like garbage."
"[From ya boy Marcus Smart himself:](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/marcus-smart-nba-boston-celtics-covid-racial-injustice)  *But the incident that has stuck with me the most, and that’s had the biggest impact on me, occurred a few years back after a victory at the Garden.*      *I was pulling out of the arena parking lot when I saw a white woman with her five- or six-year-old son crossing against the light right as the cars were starting to come at them. I had my windows down and realized something bad was about to happen, so I yelled to her, politely, that she needed to hurry and get out of the street so the two of them wouldn’t get hurt.*      *The woman was wearing an Isaiah Thomas number 4 Celts jersey. And there were all these other Celtics fans around who were at the game. I figured she’d be cool.*        *Nope.*      *She swung her head around and it was….*      *“F\*\*\* you, you f\*\*\*ing n-word!!!!”*  But y'all keep denying it and saying Kyrie is just using racism as an excuse for getting booed."
They really made us watch Marcus smart and Robert Williams just so we could see the Nets and put Doncic and LeBron on late at the same time
"[Marcus Smart was racially abused](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/marcus-smart-nba-boston-celtics-covid-racial-injustice) by someone right after a game...she was wearing an IT 4 Celtics jersey...and was with her young son, that's just all around awful"
Marcus Smart agrees
Drummond turned into Marcus Smart lmao
Facts they through Marcus smart out for that down the stretch a couple weeks ago.
"No shocker, marcus smart taking more shots than kemba &amp; Fournier is a guaranteed loss. This celtics roster, as beat up as it is, is put together like fucking shit. This celtics team plays some seriously uninspired ball."
Are we sure that’s Marcus smart guarding him lol
"The game is being commentated by Marv Albert and Grant Hill, Marv of course who is retiring, in the 3re quarter Marcus Smart has just made made a sequence of 3's, Kyrie made a 3 of his own, kyrie comes down the court and is being guarded by Nesmith, Marcus smart is guarding someone in the corner, Marv says something along the lines of ""Here comes Kyrie Irving, guarded by Marcus Smart."" This doesn't really relate, but I thought it was funny"
Marcus smart trying to duel
"And there it is, Marcus Smart back to earth"
Respect to Marcus Smart
marcus smart is the real deal
Marcus Smart: Comeback Conductor
"Marcus ""Joe Harris"" Smart"
MARCUS SMART
Celtics will come back and this will be known as “The Marcus Smart Game”
"marcus ""joe harris"" smart"
"Kyrie wasn’t being guarded by Marcus Smart, Marv has no idea what’s going on lmao"
Marcus smart cant miss jesus
OH MY GOD MARCUS SMART MAKE FIFTY MORE!!
Marcus “Steph Curry” Smart
LMAO MARCUS SMART WTF
Marcus Smart deserves to be Boston franchise player not Tatum
Marcus Smart is low key hyped that the J’s are out “this is my team”
Marcus Smart singlehandedly leading a comeback
Marcus Smart always randomly gets hot lol
Marcus Smart gonna do some stuff lol
marcus smart wanted that charge so bad
"Fuck Marcus Smart, more like Marcus Dumb!"
Marcus Smart is screaming in the #Celtics locker room and there is a bunch of arguing going on. Smart comes out say “y’all on that bullshit!” Team is imploding. Smart is in bathroom and there is still screaming coming from locker room.
"Nah, we’re waiting for game 5 Marcus Smart"
How many of these 70+ first half points did marcus “the heart and soul of our defensive identity and toughness” smart allow?
"Langford/Fournier fronting KD on the post doesn't work. They need to put a more powerful player to do that job, maybe Marcus Smart."
i wonder if marcus smart was ever close to punching kyrie at practice
How is Marcus Smart donutting   I thought this guy is supposed to be the heart of the Celtics
Marcus Smart ugliest dude in the league.
Did kemba not shoot that to preserve his percentages lol  and then there's Marcus Smart
"Oh look, Marcus Smart has initiated ""*Marcus Smart Mode*"""
"At this pace, Marcus smart will be ejected in a minute thirty"
How else would we know when Marcus smart makes a play?
"Yeah, this argument works if the difference is 5 assists to 6 assists. But 7.2 was top 15 in the league, and over double that of Morris. That argument does not work when the disparity is that high. That's like saying Marcus Smart is better than Chris Paul because numbers aren't everything - you have to then back that up with other evidence.  But let's dig into the evidence - beyond just counting stats. If Morris is better beyond the box score, his advanced stats should reflect that, right?  Payton 19/20 LEBRON: 2.04  Morris 20/21 LEBRON: -0.75  Payton 19/20 Wins Added: 3.6  Morris 20/21 Wins Added: 1.3  Payton 19/20 RAPTOR WAR: 2.5  Morris 20/21 RAPTOR WAR: 1.8  Payton 19/20 VORP: 0.6  Morris 20/21 VORP: 0.4  Payton also led in BPM, WS, etc. I literally could not find an advanced stat that did not significantly favour Elfrid Payton over Monte Morris. All the evidence indicates Payton is a decent NBA player who has been put in a bad situation as a starter on a playoff squad with reduced minutes when he should be a sixth man (I will admit it is also a likely factor that he's struggling/having a genuinely bad season). All the evidence also suggests that Morris is a league average bench player who would probably suffer a worse statistical fate in Payton's situation."
I would like to see Marcus Smart play offense in a style that won't give me ulcers
I still don’t like his defense at all and getting clamped up by a 6’3 Marcus Smart in Overtime or having a mid game against 30 Minutes of Luke Kornet in the Last 2 meetings didn’t really impress me that much either. I still like him as a Player but I think he’d be the 3rd Option between him Tatum and Brown
"Pritchard at 27 isn’t anything overly special. He is an Ok player, looks like he could potentially get 2nd team All-Rookie. Like that’s solid, but for a 23 year old rookie it isn’t like he is considered a huge steal. Quickly was picked right in front of him and looks better, and there were multiple guards after him that could easily carve out a better career.   Brown at 3 was considered a reach at the time, and that was a great move. Angie trading down from the 1 pick to get Tatum and another lotto pick was big too.   However considering how many picks Boston has had the last few years and how many misses they had, it’s concerning.   Great/Solid picks - Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Jaylen Brown, Tatum, Robert Williams, Payton Pritchard    Picks that were nothing;  James Young - 2014 17th pick  RJ Hunter - 2015 28th pick  Jordan Mickey - 2015 33rd pick  Marcus Thornton - 2015 45th pick  Guerschon Yabusele - 2016 16th pick  Ante Zizic - 2016 23rd pick  Demetrius Jackson - 2016 45th pick   Ben Bentil - 2016 51st pick  Abdel Nader - 2016 58th pick  Semi Ojeleye - 2017 37th pick  Kadeem Allen - 2017 53rd pick  Jabari Bird - 2017 56th pick  Romeo Langford - 2019 14th pick  Grant Williams - 2019 22nd pick  Carsen Edwards - 2019 33rd pick  Tremont Waters - 2019 51st pick  Aaron Neismith - 2020 14th pick   Yam Madar - 2020 47th pick    So there is 18 players that didn’t pan out since 2014 (granted some were bad picks but still a lot hit rate) and only 3 non lotto picks really panned out (with the Jury still being out of Pritchard). Not to mention they let Rozier walk for nothing."
Marcus smart shooting a 3  Marcus smart driving to the hoop  Anyone on the roster falling to the ground
"I mean he's stepping it up recently and returning to his roots but yall really dont know your history if you think he's worse than Harden, Ginobili, Divac, CP3, Varejao, Fisher, or Marcus Smart, off the top of my head"
At this point idk why we even attack flairs. Every team flops because it works and will continue working. Peak flop though was Marcus Smart launching himself never seen anything like that.
Lol clips of flopping are always made fun of and absolutely shat on c'mon. LeBron's ones are just more popular because he is obviously more famous than say a Marcus Smart or a Draymond Green
Lopez 3 point shot is only activated when he plays against the Raptors. Ditto Marcus Smart.
Jrue and Marcus Smart were the first players to come to my mind
The Marcus smart special
1.	Marcus Smart isoing 2.	Grant Williams or Semi Ojeleye checking in 3.	Tristan Thompson posting up
1. Marcus Smart taking a three 2. Grant Williams doing anything on offense 3. Tremont Waters getting minutes
"I think it's more that Lebron has a tendency to exaggerate this stuff compared to other players.   I see the same thing with Marcus Smart - dude is a really good defender and he does take a lot of hard contact. Some of them definitely look like they hurt. But he's also known for flopping a lot, so it gets harder to figure out when he's just embellishing the contact and when he legitimately took a beating."
LeBron with the Marcus Smart-esque level flop out there.
Kinda reminds me a little of Marcus smart in that sense
Caruso plays solid D but also flops a lot. It is not mutually exclusive - see Marcus Smart.
"Right, and I totally get that the guys missing for Atlanta arent nothing but there’s also consideration for the idea that you have to expect a certain level of injury over the course of a season you’re never gonna have your full rotation go the full 82. Comparing their game log to Miami’s, Indy’s, or Boston’s (or even Brooklyn’s or Philly’s) you have Jaylen Brown, Kemba, Marcus Smart, Jimmy, Kendrick Nunn, Goran Dragic, Myles Turner, Malcolm Brogdon, Kyrie, KD, and Joel Embiid all miss  20% of the season (15 games) or more. That’s a lot of important guys from the East’s playoff picture and that’s not even mentioning what’s gonna happen next year when Toronto retools because that’s gonna be another set of stubborn motherfuckers if they don’t tear it down (which they 100% shouldn’t they have Nurse, FVV, and Siakam)  Props to McMillan and I think he’s earned an extension in Atlanta, I just don’t wanna see this team rest on their laurels by saying “hey, we broke in to the 5 seed” because when you put it into context against the rest of the East it’s a pretty tight arms race up for the end of the “contending in the East” tier"
Literally if it was Marcus smart instead of Lebron it would haven been just another play.
Right above Marcus Smart
"He foul baits. He doesn't flop. One is creating a foul while the other is pretending a you got hit when you weren't. Marcus Smart, LeBron, Harden flop. Trae foul baits."
https://youtu.be/Y40txXk922M?t=45  DEFINITELY NOT A FOUL ON MARCUS SMART
"The fact that he is 6'9, 250 pounds and physically built like tank yet he be floppin like Marcus Smart.  (I do believe he doesnt get enough calls though)"
"So, basically pulling a Marcus Smart?"
"Lol, all I could think while watching Crowder and Harrell on the floor at the same time during Suns/Lakers is how Marv would probably just say, ""fuck it"" and call them both Marcus Smart through the whole game."
Dillon Brooks is what Marcus Smart thinks he is
Brooks is the Canadian Marcus Smart
Marcus Smart has to at least get an honorable mention here.
They j’s are fine it’s everyone else y’all should be worried about. I do like Marcus smart and Robert Williams tho I’m not gonna cap.
"Lebron, Embiid, … Marcus Smart?"
marcus smart level flop. hurt himself in the process
Marcus Smart with a nice pass to Smart who alley oops it to Smart.
“Marcus Smart passes it out to Marcus Smart for the three pointer!... now they’re saying it’s a Marcus Smart..”
Not even close. You aren't accounting for difficulty of shot or how any of them are guarded. Maybe the difference from Jimmy to Russ is from Russ to Marcus Smart.
marcus smart and westbrook are the two players im low key happy to see in the game when I play against their teams
"Very true for the Celtics.  **Jayson Tatum** got COVID in January and needed an inhaler during games afterward. He didn't appear fully recovered until late March.  **Robert Williams** only played 52 games, missing time with various injuries, including a knee injury that kept him out for a couple of key weeks down the stretch in April.  **Jaylen Brown** tore a ligament in his wrist in early May, missing the end of the regular season and the *entire playoffs*.  **Kemba Walker** missed the first month of the season with a knee injury.  **Marcus Smart** missed 1.5 months with a calf injury.  Those are arguably the five most important Celtics. Since late March, when Tatum appeared fully recovered from COVID, the Celtics are 7-2 in games all five of them play. Unfortunately, with JB out for the playoffs, we won't see anything close to a full-strength Celtics team in the playoffs."
"Sometimes if feels like Tatum hasn't even begun to work on his passing, to be honest.  This lob to Timelord is something we'd mainly see Marcus Smart making (often to Horford and Theis/Baynes, a few years back), even Kemba hasn't really been developing that PG/C relationship with Rob that can turn into a threat for easy 2s.  Can't recall Tatum making this play very often this year."
Don't worry Marcus Smart will also not pass to him. It's truly a team effort.
"It's ok, Brown and Tatum are young, they're still learning. Now what is a problem IMO, is Marcus Smart.   Why TF is he taking so many shots at the end of close games. Idgaf if he's open, he's open for a reason. Teams want him to shoot instead of Brown, Tatum, or Walker."
"I've been watching the Celtics my whole life and really watching closely this year, since I found it kind of an intriguing pivotal season for them. Here's my analysis: they suck  And marcus smart is a net nagative"
"Yep, welcome to Boston, where everyone except Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart mentally checks out every second game."
marcus smart is the definition of glue guy or heart and soul
Very easy for us: Marcus Smart. He’s our longest tenured player and leaves his heart on the hardwood every game
"sometimes you get Marcus “Stephen Curry” Smart (2020 Raptors Game 2, 2017 Cavs Game 3) and sometimes you get Marcus “please stop shooting” Smart (2020 Heat Game 6), all just part of the experience. I love him regardless"
"I've heard that Robert Williams as well is actually a hilarious person, as well as Marcus Smart."
"Despite being named Marcus Smart, Marcus's shot selection is not Smart."
Celtics not named Marcus Smart hitting 3's.
"Lol, says the guy with the Marcus Smart tag. Remember game 6 vs the Heat when he took 22 shots? 5 more than Jaylen Brown? Yeah that’s stupid"
"Jayson Tatum and Rob Williams are the only players worth building around on this team. Danny Ainge needs to consider everybody else in trade packages, even the “heart and soul of the team”, Marcus Smart.  Tatum and Rob Williams deserve better teammates and a better coach."
Marcus Smart about to activate Tracy McGrady Mode
"Some famously injury prone players would be Blake, Chris Paul, Joel Embiid, AD, Cousins and Kristaps. Some others would be Bagley, Kevin Love, Marcus Smart, Gallinari, and Aaron Gordon."
Marcus Smart and the refs beat us down the stretch. No way in hell the Jazz are winning it all this year (bring the downvotes)
"I’ve been at the point for a while where I think you can’t win with Marcus Smart on this team. Zero reason he should be forcing up shots. He should be the 4th option. Guy thinks he’s the #1 option. He’s just not going to listen to Brad Stevens, Tatum, or Brown. None of them carry themselves with that “leader of men” type of attitude"
Marcus Smart willed the Celtics back into the game but then really bricked some big looks down the stretch
"Marcus Smart didn’t want any OT tonight, he took that shit personally"
Is it just me or does Marcus Smart suddenly take a lot more shots at the end of a close game when we’re down?
"Celtics struggle so bad in clutch time, how the hell are you ok with 2 Marcus Smart contested 3s in a row"
just usual Marcus smart shot selection
Marcus smart and his hero ball did absolutely nothing but lay some bricks in the final 2 minutes
"I've only caught a handful of Celtics games this season but every single one, Marcus Smart shot them out of the game. What a bonehead."
Utah’s best defense is just letting Marcus Smart shoot threes
Jesus christ trade marcus smart for whatever you can get
Even still. Kyrie over Kemba. Marcus smart over Caleb Martin. Trae young over Pat Bev.
Marcus Smart will put his life on the line for a charge call
Last Jazz-Celtics game was a Jazz win 122-108 on Feb 9. No Marcus Smart or Mike Conley that game. Will be interesting to see the adjustments.
"I never said otherwise. But the original comment didn’t mention the other significant players we were missing including Marcus Smart and Theis. Smart is crucial for us on both ends of the floor and Theis is our best big though Robert Williams has more potential. Not including garbage time, our point guards had a total of two assists the first game and five the second. This is not to discount your teams‘ injuries or coaching issues, but to say that there were more impacting the Celtics that weren’t mentioned in the original post"
"All time it is Rajon Rondo, Marcus Smart, Dennis Rodman, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan  A VERY small team, but all those guys have a ton of “edge” or whatever you want to call it"
"Marcus Smart, Steph Curry, Tyrese Haliburton, Zion Williamson, Nikola Jokic  A lot of great passers lol. No idea how good it would be but any team with Curry and Jokic would be insane."
"That's all accurate, but the real variable was that while he was out, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown BOTH ended up not only NBA players, but the type of guys you re-sign and build around. It's kind of unprecedented that both of them ended up working out like they did, basically because they were forced into the minutes by Hayward's injury. Very few people besides Jaylen Brown himself thought he would grow into what he is now, a lot of Celtics fans hated that draft pick because we already had one athletic guard who can't shoot in Marcus Smart.   So, does this same thing happen, or happen anywhere near this quickly if Hayward doesn't get hurt like that? Or, if one of Tatum or Brown happens to be just meh or a bust, is there still room for Hayward? It's just crazy because none of it is his fault, but there was no spot in Boston for him to do what he's doing now"
Missing Dario Saric and Marcus Smart
"I violently disagree that Marcus Smart is a more positive defender than Michael Jordan ever was, if you're saying he was a gambler on defense just because he led the league in steals a lot, for the vast majority of his career he was very disciplined. And Kobe is like one inch shorter than Jordan, how was height his primary flaw as a defender?"
Theres no kyrie and Marcus smart to take his minutes
"Cade Cunningham will be an all after year 1 and All NBA year 2.  Technically that’s still college tho, so Marcus Smart is a more impactful player then Julius Randle."
"He concludes by saying curry is slightly worse at finishing than the guy who is arguably the best small finisher of all time.  He just doesn't emphasise it enough. I think it is the same with the Magic, Bird, Kobe and Jordan videos when he is talking about defence. He concluded they were all positive but because he spent about twice as long talking about their weaknesses on that side of the ball it makes them seem like subpar defenders. I think with Jordan and Kobe though it was especially necessary given they both made 9 1st all-defence teams (not sure how to phrase) but weren't actually that massive positives due to their flaws (gambling with Jordan surprise and Kobe lack of height) on that end compared to some guys who are getting in the teams today like Marcus Smart - I'm not familiar enough with the other players in those eras to say who should have made it ahead of them but if you just take it at face value you cna look at it and go Jordan and Kobe are the 2 best defenders of all time when a guy like Payton was clearly a tier above on that end."
People only look at the offense and the shooting.  He hasn’t become stagnant at all he’s improved every year at other facets.  His passing this year was borderline a breath of fresh air especially when Markelle went down because he was a better playmaker than all of our other guards.  He played backup point guard for large stretches and other than when he was guarded by Marcus Smart and Jrue Holiday he took advantage of that big time.   And defensively he continue to play at a borderline all defensive level.  This idea that he’s stagnant comes from people who only read slash lines and never watch the game.  If you watch a single game of his watch when we play Dallas and see how Luka struggle to score when guarded by AG.  He never falls for the step back or the silly touch fouls and the only time Luka got off was when AG was switched off of him or whenever the coach called for traps for some reason and Luka made the smart pass.
"I've been watching you guys a lot this year and have definitely noticed how raw he still is. He gets a ton of blocks but does so by being overly eager to leave his feet, which often leads to him fouling or being unable to rotate when the ball gets dumped off. His effort level is through the roof though. He's possibly the best rebounder for his height in the league, gets a good amount of steals, and is always going after loose balls. He seems like he has that same mentality that Marcus Smart has, where if he can't beat you with skill and finesse he'll just do it through sheer willpower and hustle.   If he figures out the little nuances of his game and becomes more disciplined (he's already improved over last year), then he's going to be a great starting center for you guys, but even if he doesn't, his floor is as one of the best backup/situational centers in the league. I think he'll be really good in the playoffs this year, Stevens is going to find him some really good matchups that he can dominate, and he'll have a whole series to get into a rhythm with his assignment."
"&gt;Celtics trade for: Chris Boucher   &gt;   &gt;Raptors get: Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, 2 FRP in 2022 and 2024  What the fuck? 2 lottery picks + 2 FRP'S?  Boucher is great, but for that price tag? Hell no.  &gt;DEAL 2:   &gt;   &gt;Celtics trade for: Lonzo Ball and Wily Hernangomez   &gt;   &gt;Pelicans get: Marcus Smart and Payton Pritchard  Lonzo Ball has been shooting lights out, but he's not a better defender than Smart (heart and soul of our team too,) and why the fuck are we losing all of our guard depth? I'd rather keep Smart + PP over Lonzo Ball.  Ball is gonna get paid + RFA. We could lose him.   DEAL 3:  &gt;Celtics trade for: PJ Tucker   &gt;   &gt;Rockets get: Tristan Thompson and 2022 2nd Rd. Pick   &gt;   &gt;Use Exception to SIGN **Andre Drummond** \[offer him guaranteed big role\] and cut Theis/Wily  You're fucking high."
"you would think that's how it works, but it really doesn't honestly   i think it was HPBasketball who did a piece on Marcus Smart before he became like a decent three point shooter, where teams would still go closeout on him even tho he was shooting like 31%, it's the same thing here, when Devontae gets in the paint, one person atleast will help and that's enough for a kickout"
"He is a very good, highly athletic defender that can guard multiple positions. On offense, he is a streaky shooter and that limits him somewhat. On a contending team, he is probably a good role player. He could fill that marcus smart role where he can provide a lot of energy, hustle, and defense for a stretch."
Rather trade Kemba than Marcus Smart tbh
Don’t want to seem whiny but isn’t it funny how Caruso doing a ok chase down block got 20k upvotes but Marcus smart doing a series saving chase down block that’s arguably more impressive and was clutch isn’t even on the list
Needs more Marcus Smart.
"Marcus Smart.  I've never seen a guy try harder to help his team win.  And while he doesn't always do everything consistently, I truly believe he's capable of just about anything on the basketball court.  Crazy step back 3?  Marcus Smart.  Absurd, why-are-you-even-attempting-that-pass-in-the-first-place assist?  Marcus Smart.  Out rebound a 7 footer?  Marcus Smart.  He will always give 100%, has developed into a pretty decent offensive player (he's a good 3P shooter, runs a good PnR, and is a pretty good passer), and has always been one of the best defensive guards in the league.  He might not be the best player on the team, but I will never complain about anything he does because he's doing it in an effort to win.  He's also a very smart player who holds everyone else on the team accountable."
Putting the league on notice:  Marcus Smart is back and the celtics are no longer taking sundays off.
"hahaha, what a goofball!!! him, Kelly Olynyk and Marcus Smart I think are the funniest NBA players going right now with some honorable mentions I have no time to write out lol!!"
Marcus smart after gibson
"Is this post about individual players or team ratings?   Exactly. You have no argument and you know it so you have to run away and hide.  Jokic &gt; Gobert, Harden &gt; Simmons, Kyrie &gt; Marcus Smart. Anyone with eyes and a brain knows this."

"&gt; They have the Jay's locked in for like 5 years  Brown is under contract for 3 more seasons after this one, and Tatum can opt out 4 years from now. But this ""locked up"" bit assumes neither one asks to be traded between now and then. If you don't think that can happen, just look at Kawhi, AD, PG, Harden, etc. Nobody is ""locked up"" just cause they're still under contract. If Boston doesn't turn things around and stays at around .500 over the next couple years, what's the guarantee that those guys stay committed to the Celtics? Keep in mind, next year is a contract year for Marcus Smart. What does Boston's future look like a year from now if Smart bounces?"
Marcus smart DPOY  Or harden
Marcus Smart baybeeee
Marcus Smart is S-Tier dick head player
You’re describing Marcus Smart entire career.
Yeah we gonna have that come up.with the next Marcus Smart contract
Marcus Smart is back lol.
Marcus Smart is a turd
"Marcus ""Dumbass"" Smart"
"To be fair, this was Smarts first game back and clearly he was not himself.  His shots were falling, but he didn’t play very great defense or facilitate very well. But, once he gets back into form he will be *the* Marcus Smart again."

"I’m joking that Marcus Smart injures 67% of the players he plays against but that doesn’t mean he isn’t a dirty player  Also wdym “you’re getting really hard to follow with all your dumb posting,” like stfu you don’t have to look if you’re too dumb to understand a simple idea"
If they ever watch a Marcus Smart highlights compilation they would be amazed. He isn't elite offensively but the defensive plays he makes are insane
You’ve got to be joking right? You’re defending Marcus Smart being a dirty player... *on a video of him doing a dirty play*
"It’s Marcus Smart, he gets a different whistle."
"Marcus Smart looking like a clown on this play, my goodness."
"I think Kemba is a better fit, because he not going to throw his teammates or Coaches under the bus when things ain't going right. With that said I actually think Kemba ain't that good of fit, this might be a hot take but I actually think Marcus Smart is a much better fit with Tatum and Brown."
"Definitely doesn’t flop nearly as much as those guys do and people enjoy watching him because he makes winning plays, blocks people at the rim, gets big rebounds, dives on the floor or out of bounds for loose balls he just hustles his ass off all the time  I enjoy watching him make great defensive plays or smart passes over harden free throws or Trae letting defenders run into him and flailing a shot at the backboard. Marcus flops for sure but what he brings is effort instead of just pure shotmaking talent"

"Seeing as we were fine with trading DRose who was playing hard, he could have just asked us. I don't believe anyone is competitive enough to make it to the NBA, and then just not try for half a season. Like Blake didn't show once this season that he has the athleticism he had in 2019 this season. He was definitely coasting, but in that case you could usually see on occasion what they can do.  Marcus Smart literally said we target Blake Griffin because we know he's washed, and Blake still couldn't keep up. No way he's taking that smack and still not trying."

"I don't think you can classify as a rebuild when you have 3 max players , 2 of whom are current all stars, plus you have Marcus Smart. You are clearly competing for a title so that is not a rebuild in any sense of the word. You are what the sixers were last year, a good team on paper that just isn't getting it done."
This was in reference to the phantom foul on the Marcus Smart 3. Lol. But that 3PT stat is rough for sure!
"Gotta love watching Jaylen run with the bench scrubs that wouldn’t even get minutes on the other team to start the fourth quarter meanwhile the only guy consistently hitting shots, Jayson, sits on the bench, as we go down double digits.  Then Jayson comes in and immediately makes two beautiful shots and cuts the lead to like five drawing a double team also to lead to an easy bucket. What do we do after that you may be asking? Give the ball to Jaylen Brown, and Kemba for a few plays, but mostly Jaylen Brown to miss shot after shot and turn it over, over and over again. I know what your thinking, genius game plan by Brad because then he lets Tatum loose the last two minutes so you can go crazy? Nah. Instead we give it to the guy living on Antarctica over there.  Great game plan Brad, very inspirational.  Also, would like to here your opinions. Do you think Silver comes up to Brad before every game and tells him if he uses his challenge Adam will kill a puppy?  None of that really matters tho. Still fun to watch because we had a couple good scores off of in bounds plays.  On a serious note, every game Marcus Smart plays he moves up on my favorite players of all time list (well mostly every game). Glad he is back."
Marcus Smart easy.
"I’d say Marcus Smart is the best flop artist. If you ask who is the best at drawing fouls, I’d call it a tie between Embiid and Harden"
Marcus Smart lmao
Marcus Smart flies backwards like he got shot by a .22 in a Hollywood action movie. That takes gumption.  I give him props.
"Yeah it would be a cool idea. Some candidates would be Marcus Smart, Josh Hart, Chris Paul, and Dejounte Murray. Those guys are some leaders on their respective teams"
Can someone post that Marcus smart foul on James Harden and explain how was that a foul?
Marcus Smart really helping the Celtics here  Edit: and the bad miss lol
Is Marcus Smart gonna always come off the bench this season
"Marcus Smart missed 18 games? That seems like a lot, dang"
Marcus Smart lowkey hot
Have you seen Terry Rozier or Marcus Smart
"Celtics are going to crush them.  He’ll be limited, but watch how much of a different team they are with Marcus Smart."
Marcus Smart is back! LETSGOOOOOOOOOOOO
"The biggest X-factor (even greater than Pascal being awful somehow) was Marcus Smart shooting 39% on 9 attempts from 3. His offensive output was backbreaking for the Raptors. He singlehandedly killed their defensive scheme. They wanted to ice Kemba and Tatum out, and Smart punished them hard. Jaylen Brown also played well but there was a clear cut effort to try and stifle the Celtics offense by smothering their two distributors."
"Yes - Marcus Smart has missed 9 games the Celtics lost in, all but one of which was winnable in the 4th quarter.  He flips even 3 of them and the Celtics are tied with Milwaukee and the ""Celtics are bad"" crowd is silent.  Plus, the Celtics biggest issue is depth - in the playoffs that becomes a lot less of an issue when the starters are playing 40 minutes.  Celtics are better built for the postseason than they are the regular season.  The East is congested with good teams this year.  Every single series is going to be a blood bath and I think it's foolish to start writing off good teams already."
"Umm the Celtics went to 3 out of the 4 last ECF's lol. Also how did he lose Kyrie when Kyrie was never staying? Also Hayward was looking for a better role and better deal and got it with the Hornets, and Ainge got the biggest PTE in league history out of it instead of nothing. He also traded Rozier and we got the cap space to sign Kemba. So you wanted Ainge to trade Brown for Cousins and Tatum for one year of either Kawhi, Davis and PG? LMAO  The Celtics would be the laughing stock of the league and a 12 win team with a roster of 2nd year players and Marcus Smart if we were lucky enough to keep him"
"didn’t say it was a 1 for 1 trade   also i wouldn’t be so sure about it, there aren’t many better fits in the league next to luka doncic than marcus smart would be, you’d be pretty hard pressed to field a better offer for KP than smart+ stuff"
Marcus Smart
Take Marcus Smart off Boston's hands.
"Donovan Mitchell, Derrick White, Kemba Walker, Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, Mason Plumlee, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Harrison Barnes, Marcus Smart, and Joe Harris.  Not the best team we could have sent, but they definitely should have finished better than 7th."
"Probably worse? Bruh it’s obviously worse. That team had joe Harris, Derrick white, Marcus smart, Harrison barnes, mason plumlee, kemba, Myles turner, and brook lopez. The only players on that team that are on the level of any player on this team were Mitchell, tatum, brown, and Middleton"
Would love Marcus smart on the Bulls
Who is Marcus Smart
"Dude has the worst trade suggestion I might have every seen, and that’s not even me being bias lmao   Mf said Derrick White AND Dejounte Murray for   Marcus Smart, Tristian Thompson,  Aaron Nesmtih and Payton Pritchard. I gotta get off this app lmao"
"So the plan is to intentionally trade 2 of our only good players for worse assets than what they’re worth? What is the logic in that? The ceiling of white and Murray isn’t what potentially brings a chip. They are supporting pieces. It’s the  players you add onto that, and  the players you develop with them that vaults you to that position.   “Tank for first pick”   We can literally tank with those 2 on the roster without taking on worse players. And either way tanking doesn’t guarantee you get the 1st pick.   “And absorb bad contracts to get FR so finally found gems like Manu and Parker from late picks”   I’m 100% confused on what you meant by that statement so I’m just going to assume you meant take on bad contracts to get picks so we can get gems like manu and tony. In that terrible deal you suggested we got Tristan Thompson who has absolutely 0 positive value, Marcus Smart who is expiring and 2 players at rookie deals at positions which we literally do not need. On top of that no picks whatsoever. And the Spurs have already found and developed gems with late picks; those being Derrick White and Dejounte Murray both of whom were 29th picks, and both of whom who aren’t getting traded for scraps to the Celtics."
"Marcus smart , tristan Thompson , payton pritchard  , aaron nesmith   For both of them"
"The Boston is the best package for both teams. Brown is amazing fit in Boston but he is a cut below Dame level (superstar/mvp level) player. Dame and Jayson Tatum would be like CP3 and Booker on crack. Also completely and beautifully fills Boston's void at the PG position and with Horford back, Timelord, Thompson they aren't lacking bad with bigs to help out and they have shooters. Boston can throw in picks, Marcus Smart, or young players like Nesmith to sweeten the deal. Portland can remain competitive with a renewed identity centered around the defensive potential of JB + Smart. Possibly let Smart handle the ball. Not perfect for Portland but it's a situation where they have assets they can ship off if they want to fully rebuild or they can try to retool for a quicker turnaround. Team would need work though tbh before it could be championship level with Brown and McCollum as your best players. Could be a great free agent destination though if they have cap space idk if they do or not"
"That's a bad plan. He's like Marcus Smart. Wants to shoot, and gets overvalued due to his defense.   I don't care how good he is defensively. He shouldn't be 3-12 when there's 6 min left in the first half.  He shouldn't be taking 12 shots in a half with Giannis and Middleton on the floor. He shouldn't be taking more than 12 in three quarters. That, and the Suns unsustainable 3 point shooting, imo, is what did the job. If they didn't play through Jru, Bucks probably pull away to a 5-8 point win.  I am utterly convinced that both teams at their best, Bucks are just better and have the best player.  But the Suns are just so much more of a unit, that they may not even need to BE at their best to beat this Bucks team, which looks like a child playing 2k."
nah that shot seals it. marcus smart is way better than jrue holiday wtf was that
marcus smart is way better
People actually said Jrue was better than Marcus Smart
Marcus Smart better + ratio
Marcus Smart &gt; Jrue Holiday
Such a shame cause he's a great guy next to Dame and Curry. Renaldo is a great guy too and right up there. But Marcus Smart and Pat Bev aren't on the list?  Makes me think a bunch of losers who peaked in high school are mad!
Playing in msg and being beloved by New Yorkers instead of whatever Marcus smart experiences
"Not especially. But, I'm not that emotionally invested.   I mean, you have a Celtics flair. Marcus Smart is the flophouse king, to be fair."
"I mean he's definitely wrong but it's still kinda funny tho. I'm thinking Lebron, CP3, Marcus Smart, PatBev and Harden. Imagine how long that first ~quarter and half would be 🤣🤣🤣"
To take a shot = Ray Allen   To create their own = Jordan or Bird or Durant   Defending a player = Lebron or Marcus Smart :)
"Man most of em do.   You asked the question generally for all NBA players, yet everyone is only thinking in terms of stars. That’s the flaw;  thinking that the psycho mentality is what makes players great. It really isn’t  Bc there’s PLENTY of players with a crazy will to win: Patrick Beverly, Marcus smart, PJ Tucker, I could go on. Doesnt elevate them to star status. Or, you think Magic Johnson with the goofy Hollywood smile didn’t want to tear your head off and win every chip? Yet he doesn’t have the ‘psychopath’ stigma. So that’s the dirty little secret is 99% of the time the whole ‘crazed will to win’ shit is overblown. It’s tv bullshit. Bc you are a maniac doesn’t mean you’re gonna be a better player, and Bc you don’t outwardly show it doesn’t mean you want to win any less   RIP Kobe but that’s why the whole concept of ‘mamba mentality’ has always made me laugh. Like what exactly does that mean.  Kobe wanted it more then anyone , but come game 7 to beat the team who beat him before and he went 6/24  🤨 Did he not have the ‘crazy will to win’ that night?  And on the flip he goes out and drops 81 for no reason at all other than he was that nice. Didnt say a word, he wasnt trash talked, etc.   Lastly, my favorite part from Jordan rules that I actually had to look up bc they hid it. That game where the media was all over him for being ‘caught’ gambling the night before. They were down 2-0 to NY. Absolute must win and the world on his back. Surely he’s gonna take it personal! Grr will to win. And that’s how last dance covered it. Bulls blew NY out by 20. Jordan takes all slights and becomes Thanos is how it is as framed. Except  ….*Bro Mike was 3/18 that game*  ‘Will to win’ is so overblown. /rant"
Marcus Smart  hopefully the defensive mentality will rise
Jaylen Browon + Marcus Smart for Bradley Beal. Who says no?
"This is why I have steph as a better defender than marcus smart, that 45% 3PT can’t be ignored"
"Well, he did train under Marcus Smart"
"Jae ""Marcus Smart"" Crowder"
"Trey young, James harden, Marcus smart, jimmy butler, Joel embiid would all be right there with him.  These fuckers make a living at the line and  make the refs look incompetent, not difficult mind you."
"Hahaha I mean James Harden and Marcus Smart probably flop more than these suns, and Luka complains about 100 times a game. But I still love the game. Hoping for 7."
"I hate flopping, but you can embellish the fact that you got destroyed by a dude. I get more angry at the Marcus Smart type where they don’t actually get hit and the CP3 stop and let people run you over. If you lower you shoulder that obviously and powerfully then you gotta know that the other dude may overreact. I’m just saying people are not understanding the restricted area."
i LOVE marcus smart.
"&gt;he is definitely an above average shooter.  Do you mean this is what he thinks about himself, or do you actually think he's an above average shooter? I sure hope it's that first thing, otherwise, you should check out his stats on basketball reference. Marcus Smart is an awful shooter for a  guard."
"I think his offense as a whole is overrated, especially his 3pt shooting, but I actually think he’s an underrated playmaker. Also, his defense is properly rated to me, as he’s one of the premier guard defenders in the league. I learned a lot reading the post about Marcus Smart by u/Wayne_Spooney earlier, you should look at it as well"
Marcus Smart move
"if i can recall, marcus smart kinda got screwed by the market and signed a 4/50 contract. I think hes worth more than that"
Answer: Marcus Smart has NEVER been the answer.
"Kemba with Smart's defense would have been the best point guard the celtics get. Unfortunately Kemba is super injury prone, and Marcus Smart makes a bunch of boneheaded decisions.  You are right though, Smart's inability to drive and kick or shoot offball really hurt the celtics. I genuinely don't think hes the answer, but I don't know who is. The J's have similar playstyles and unless one of them develops some playmaking skills, its gonna tough looking for a complementary pg.  They need a 1 who can initiate  in halfcourt, drive, and shoot 3's when not handling the ball.  I don't know if celtics want him or how the fans feel about him, but I think Lonzo would be really great in Boston."
"""Is Marcus the Smart answer"" it was right there lol"
Marcus Smart is the Draymond Green of the Celtics lockerroom. His leadership is indispensable. What he brings is beyond stats. The Boston Celtics will lose a lot of grit if he’s not part of the team.
"Marcus Smart will be the role player Marcus decides to be. If he wants to be a star PG, then NO. If he wants to be a PG facilitator, then NO. If he wants to D up, bound, and shoot a kick out 3 when open, then fine.   I think Celtics fans overvalue this guy tremendously."
"Marcus smart is not the answer to the PG spot. He’s a great defender &amp; plays hard, but they need somebody to compliment Tatum. &amp; Marcus smart doesn’t give much production along side him"
"They don't need a playmaking PG to be a good team, but it'd really unlock Tatum and Brown.  Quite simply, Tatum and more importantly Brown, aren't good playmakers yet (maybe not ever for Brown).  It's really really really hard to be a sole playmaker and have such a huge scoring load that you expect from Tatum.  It's pretty much just Lebron who has been successful doing that in the past 20 years.  Giannis has had a much easier time this year with the addition of Holiday.  If Brown can't run an offense well enough to get Tatum good easy looks, then someone else should.  And I don't think Marcus is that guy either, he doesn't command much attention because he's a poor shooter, so teams dare him to pullup, and he's not great at finishing, removing his effectiveness at drive and kicks.  &amp;#x200B;  Now the point about the Clippers is good.  There is potential that a PG isn't needed.  However, both Kawhi and PG are both better playmakers than either Tatum or Brown right now.  It's a lot to ask for the Jays to become that good in regards to playmaking in one season.  It's highly improbably.  It'd be easier just to lighten their load while they try and get better.  But my conclusion is the same as it's been since the Kemba trade.  Let Marcus be the starting PG this year, don't commit to any new contracts.  And pray Tatum tampers hard enough with Beal over the next year and sign him next summer.  It would require renouncing Smart and Timelord (and dumping Al with a 1st), but well worth it."
"&gt; I think I’ve hinted at the case for not *Smarting* Marcus several times in the argument for it.   Whether this typo is intentional or not, I like it.  Also, definitely a fan of Smart. Such a hard guy to play against. Don’t love the Celtics but always root for this guy to do well in his career."
Probably Marcus Smart
I'm on that Marcus Smart train until it wins a title or crashes and burns.

His lower centre of gravity (6’4” or so) gives him an advantage in the defensive situation but really limits his ability to finish at the rim. It works for steph because he can stop and pull up or peak tony parker tear drop. Marcus smart doesn’t have those abilities
You've clearly done your homework on Marcus Smart.
Poku is gonna fizzle out with injuries and Dort is just gonna be a better version of Marcus Smart.
I’m playing with new sliders and in game 1 of the Eastern Semis Marcus Smart started the game 7/7 on pull up off the dribble 3s   I think I broke something tbh
Yeah super realistic   Marcus Smart just dropped a 31/15/9 with 6 steals on my ass on 11 shots   I’m so mad   I’m so fucking mad lol
"What do you consider a star? Most drafts have more than 2 guys who end up making at least one all star team. 2015 was a bad draft and they had Towns, KP, DLo, Booker.  2018 had Luka, SGA, Trae, Ayton  2013 has been criticized as a bad draft but had Giannis, Gobert, Oladipo, McCollum.   I know the draft is a crapshoot, but I’m still hoping to find a starter or strong rotation piece at 8-10. Marcus Smart is good, and was drafted 7th, and that’s kind of what I’m hoping to get from mid lottery I think,"
"If you want Marcus Smart, Springer makes way more sense than Mitchell."
I think I would probably draft him in the 13-20 range in a mock draft. The defense was good for sure but to me he simply lacks the offense or the physical tools to go in the lottery. Marcus smart for instance has a gigantic wingspan.
"But especially so in Boston. Where they call their own players the N word, ask Marcus Smart"
"Dude, he better be passing the ball to Jaylen and Jayson, literally your 2 best scoring options... If Marcus Smart gets more assists to Daniel Theis or Tristan Thompson then your offense is in the shit tier"
Subverting this: Kyle Lowry and Marcus Smart.  That backcourt would average 40 flops a game.
"Individual player history plays into how we perceive player actions, specifically refs. Giannis is a stand-up dude, clean record. So he gets the benefit of the doubt for a questionable play.  If Raja Bell, Zaza Paculia or Ron Arrest did something it would be seen as dirty.  If Marcus Smart, Jae Crowder or if PJ Tucker did something it would be seen as accident due to their tough defense play style."
Pat Bev and Marcus Smart I would love to see them just go at people
Jrue Holiday and Marcus Smart.
"marcus smart, evan fournier, jaylen brown, jayson tatum, and al horford."
Best defensive guard in the league. Plays real defense without the hacking and dirty plays like Marcus Smart &amp; Pat Bev. They hold/foul guys all day and think they’re great defenders. Jrue is a perfect example of how you’d want your guards to defend.
"Even if he doesn't improve, consider what you get with Ben:  Half court set: stands in the dunker's spot. That's okay, you've got Horford back who would stretch the floor. TT is shipped off. Only issue is synergy with Timelord, who I do believe will take a leap in development next year.  Fast break: The Lebron setup, with a scary freight train with perfect passing vision running down the court and shooters spread out.  Defense: Defense.  Marcus Smart is the only valuable piece in that theoretical trade. Tristain Thompson has some value, but the rest of the package is negligible at best, and Seth Curry is better than Payton Pritchard by all measurable accounts."
JB and Marcus smart both have pretty good contracts for what they provide
"Zach LaVine, Julius Randle, Marcus Smart, Christian Wood, Royce ONeale, Seth Curry"
"Uhhh, the Celtics already have one Marcus Smart"
"Even then, I think that's too much for Ben Simmons. Maybe I'm too caught up in recency bias, but I would rather have Marcus smart than Ben Simmons."
"true, marcus smart too. Wouldn't trade him for any player in the league. He's too good"
"Nothing. Tatum and Brown are off limits, and Smart is not enough to start a conversation (it's fun to talk shit but Simmons is still worth more than Marcus Smart)."
Less step backs and fade aways then?  Or is he taking his talents to be nurtured by Marcus Smart?
"Marcus Smart against the Rockets drawing 2 charges on Harden in 5 seconds to steal the game. Don't need to say his score because stats don't matter, only winning plays."
"These playoffs, Smart averaged 17.8 on 43.9% from the field and 37.2% (8.6 attempts per game) from 3 for a 59.1% ts. Simmons averaged 11.9 on 58.4 ts% including 9.9 points on 53.2% ts vs the Hawks.  I’m not saying he would or wouldn’t help you guys but Simmons has never averaged as many points as Marcus did and has only shot so efficiently once of three postseasons. So don’t shit on Marcus using incorrect numbers."
"I think the potential might have been there. But it seem like he was the anti Marcus Smart. Good box scores, but he doesn't help his team win. Throughout his most ""dominant"" years, he was a net negative every time he stepped onto the court. I think playing with bad teams will do that, and he was much better than his replacement players on the bench. But he is absolutely not on the same tier as Embiid and Jokic."
"Yo, since Jokic and Embiid have broken out in the last couple years this feels really weird. Maybe it’s because of the “veteran dawg” narrative and the all hustle attitude, but in my head I imagine Marcus Smart to be like 32. Prayers up for my guy to get a fat next contract and kinda just chill on the All-Defense reputation, while being the only guy to be fined for flopping."
"Horford's deal cuts in half *if they want to cut him*. If they want to keep him he'll get the full amount. So Boston's question is do they want to pay Horford $26.5 million for him to play for the Celtics, or do they want to pay him $14.5 million to play for someone else.   This idea of cap space for the Celtics in the summer of 2022 doesn't factor in whatever Evan Fournier, Marcus Smart and Robert Williams will be getting. Fournier is a free agent, so if they bring him back it'll cost them, and both Smart and Williams are up for extensions this summer. How likely is it that they'll have none of those guys signed next summer while they wait to see whether Beal wants to sign with them or not? I think it's pretty unlikely."
"I think 2014 just has Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Marcus Smart  2013 is Cody Zeller, CJ McCullom, Giannis Antetokoumpo, Rudy Gobert  Pretty much it’s only the top players in any given draft and Cody Zeller who stays with their team 7+ years"
Marcus Smart or Lowry or Ilyasova would lock up shaq with post flops. Not allowed to be strong in 2021.
Are you sure? This sub was saying even Marcus Smart is better than Ben Simmons and I got downvoted for disagreeing lmao.
"The NBA should review flops postgame, and deliver one game suspensions for blatant floppers like Marcus Smart or LeBron. They need to stop rewarding floppers and start making examples out of them. The amount of times nba players flop is utterly embarrassing"
There was a game this season Celtics v Pistons while Marcus Smart was injured where he sat with Mike Gorman and Scal for a full quarter of the game
It’s a long shot and this is going to sound crazy but how about Simmons for Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart just for the hell of it lol
"Chris Paul, Marcus smart, any others?"
"&gt;Did Clippers win any this season?  Did I say they did? It was argued they were cursed so I pointed out that Lakers are the same.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Is Kawhi going to re-sign?   I'd put it at roughly a 95% chance. It simply makes too much sense.  1) Kawhi wants to be the top dog. He wants to be the leader, whether we think he can be or not. If he goes to say, the Lakers, or the Warriors or the Heat, or potentially the Mavs, he either might not be the best player or he might not be the leader of the team.  &amp;#x200B;  2) Kawhi wants to be with his family. This is easily the most pressing and important reason. He left the title winners who loved him, where he was the best player but not the leader, in a culture that embraced him, and after winning another FMVP to go to LA. Why? Because some things are more important than Basketball, family being one of them. He wants to be with his family.  &amp;#x200B;  3) Kawhi wants to be in LA. This is shown by him integrating himself into the LA culture and marketing/advertising/promoting himself in a way to make himself seem like a pure LA player.  &amp;#x200B;  4) Kawhi would have chosen the Lakers already if he wanted to go there. He didn't, because this ties into reason 1. He wants to be the leader and the top dog, and he probably wants to be the underdog.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;How are the Clippers going to swing a trade with their cap space and their lack of assets?   Unless a superstar trade happens, Clippers are and should be favoured to come out of the West next year.  I don't want to go on a tirade about why, I think you are reasonable enough to agree, but changes like Ty Lue over Doc, PG13 rising up, taking the Suns to 6 without Kawhi, overcoming the doubters and haters and finally gaining an identity, roleplayers stepping up, extremely attractive FA destination already and becomes even more appealing, ect ect.  In terms of youth, Lebron is 36, will be 37 this year, turning 38 next year and AD will be 29. Both are or are becoming injury prone. The Lakers roster is an absolute mess right now and a LOT of changes need to happen, going by Lakers fans and outsider fans. Their best and only valuable asset is THT, who has potential but not an All Star ceiling.  Kawhi is 30, turning 31 next year and is injury prone. Paul George is 31, turning 32 next year and is not injury prone. The Clippers roster is strong but smart moves need to be made in signings and keeping key pieces while having to let go of others and replace them. They have a very promising young talent in Mann who dropped 40 in the playoffs as a piece for the future and for potential trades.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Or do you think Luke Kennard, Marcus Morris and 1 draft pick in 7 years later is enough to get Dame?  I don't know if it is and I don't think it matters. Clippers will make a call to the Blazers for Dame offers, negotiate a bit, test the water to see the value of some assets and hang the phone up eventually. They don't need Dame like the Lakers ""need"" Dame. Only way Dame even goes to LA is if he says ""I will not play in your team unless you trade me to the Los Angeles Lakers."" You think Dame does that?"
"The 2019 world cup roster:  Derrick White, Donovan Mitchell, Joe Harris, Marcus Smart, Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Mason Plumlee, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Kemba Walker"
Marcus Smart did the same thing to Embiid. But nobody blinked.
"Yeah the inconsistency of people hating on flopping really bothers me  Marcus Smart can flop and he’s a tremendous defender, Lillard can jump into his own teammate and he’s a killer &amp; the best scorer in the league  Chris Paul can fall down after a hit and everything he’s ever worked for is meaningless and he’s less than a human being, James Harden can hook your arms reaching for the ball and every basket he’s ever scored has been gifted to him by refs  It’s really immature, usually Reddit has better discussions than Instagram/Twitter, but it seems like stupid fans are just always gonna be a part of the NBA"
Pat bev is a stepped on marcus smart.
Dudes an ass. He is a professional instigator and his flops are on par with Marcus Smart and LeBron
"My point is, a) I don't think he is as dirty as you're letting on and b) you said you'd be uncomfortable with your primary defender having a history of dirty plays, and I think you could easily argue Smart has just as much of a history of dirty plays that Beverly has...so its ironic  I agree dirty plays are terrible and should be spoken out against, but I just don't think he has really done that beyond a few examples..if we want to call out every single player who has ever made a dirty play, it would be a very long list. I've seen Embiid and Simmons make way more dangerous plays this post season than anything I've ever seen Beverly do, but no one is coming for their heads. Lebron pushed Embiid out of the air earlier this year, no on is calling him a dirty player. Vince Carter almost ended Patrick McCaw's career, but no one calls him a dirty player....the list goes on and on...the difference here is you (and most other people) hate Beverly so you are exaggerating just how dirty he actually is. He is a pest, but he really isn't that dirty.  &gt;The Celtics and Marcus smart have nothing to do with this conversation.  Well you literally said this ""I would be uncomfortable too knowing my primary defender is a dirty player with a history of injuring people"" which is why I brought up Smart.   Just feels like you are getting up on your soapbox unnecessarily is all."
"Being a Celtics fan doesn’t make me a hypocrite for calling out Beverly lol.  If smart is as dirty as pat bev (which I don’t think he is) then he should be getting ridiculed just as much as pat bev.  There is no place in the league for these dirty plays, whether it’s pat bev or Marcus smart.  Everyone always attaches somebody’s “team” to a situation where it doesn’t apply.  I don’t have a team when it comes to player safety.  The Celtics and Marcus smart have nothing to do with this conversation.  I’m talking about pat bev being a dirty player, and if he was on the Celtics I still wouldn’t like him."
"**2014 select team**  * Harrison Barnes, Golden State Warriors * Trey Burke, Utah Jazz * Jimmy Butler, Chicago Bulls * Draymond Green, Golden State Warriors * Tim Hardaway Jr., New York Knicks * Tobias Harris, Orlando Magic * Doug McDermott, Chicago Bulls * Victor Oladipo, Orlando Magic * Mason Plumlee, Brooklyn Nets * Miles Plumlee, Phoenix Suns * Marcus Smart, Boston Celtics * Dion Waiters, Cleveland Cavaliers * Cody Zeller, Charlotte Hornets  where?"
"Adding onto what others have said, it’s a good place for future relationships to develop. Ime Udoka talked today about how he first met Marcus Smart years ago at USA select team sessions. Now Udoka is coaching Smart for the Celtics."
"In the streets CP is back on his feet swinging. But on the court? He died. They really need to enforce the flopping in that league. Make them reviewable, with technical fouls being the penalty. Whatever happened to the fines they said they would serve. My opinion isn’t based on this video but years of watching the league. I’m also from Boston where a Marcus Smart dies multiple times a game."
They used to issue fines but im pretty sure that was only for Marcus smart
"In the Celtics/Nets series, he called Marcus Smart ""dirty"" for boxing out on a shot.  When Van Gundy called him on it, Jackson ignored it because Van Gundy isn't from ""the city"" so he doesn't know what a dirty play is."
"Rounding out the top 3, you have Marcus Smart making the cut and Montrez Harrel in second, all chasing the number 1 option, Patrick Beverly."
Bruh come on lol. People don’t hate Marcus Smart or Lu Dort and they’re hard defenders. Beverley does a whole lot more than play defense and you’re being disingenuous.
Fun fact I saw on TV… Only Two players in the last few years have been fined for flopping. Marcus smart…and Pat Beverly
Anyone who puts his defense on the same level as Marcus smart/jrue holiday is a casual. Guy is objectively dirty and the nba let’s him get away with it
Ben Simmons  Marcus Smart  OG Anunoby  Giannis  Anthony Davis  Bench:  Jrue Holiday  Draymond Green  Rudy Gobert
"Marcus smart, high IQ defender"
"Kinda easy when you can pick superstars like AD or Giannis IMO, so a true ""fuck offense"" line up...    -------------------  Ben Simmons  Marcus Smart  Matisse Thybulle  Draymond Green  Rudy Gobert"
"Ben Simmons Jrue Holiday Kawhi Leonard Draymond Green Anthony Davis.   Bench: Marcus Smart, Mattise Thybule, Giannis, Bam Adebayo  This lineup is allowing 50 points per game"
"This team would cruise to a championship, but I would make a couple small lineup changes:   Ben Simmons Marcus Smart Thybulle Giannis AD  Isaac/Draymond/Gobert off the bench is giving absolute nightmares to bench units. Starting lineup isn’t the best spacing but definitely manageable, AD and Giannis can get 30 any night and Ben is at least surrounded by 4 guys who can make a 3. (Though to varying degrees of efficiency).   Both the starters and the bench would be the greatest defense of all time. Offense would be a lot of transition after steals and rebounds, and you can go to AD or Giannis and iso for points. Draymond would be the primary playmaker off the bench.   This team is just too elite defensively at every single position to lose to any team imo."
"G - Jrue Holiday   G - Ben Simmons   F - Draymond Green  F - Giannis Antetokounmpo    C - Anthony Davis  Bench: Rudy Gobert, Alex Caruso, Marcus Smart, Jonathan Isaac, OG Anunoby"
"Some $10-13m players: Marcus Smart, Jusuf Nurkic, Kelly Oubre, Kelly Olynyk.  Or to look at it more broadly:   Average 4th highest paid player on a team: $15.46m  Average 5th highest paid player on a team: $10.89m  So if you think Wiggins should be the 4th-5th highest paid player on a team, a good contract should be like $10-15m"
Marcus Smart.
We still got Marcus Smart baby
23m for the 4th best player on your team is kinda gross. Marcus Smart is a better player than Bridges and got 13m less than him and I still consider it a bit of an overpay.
22.5 mil a year is close to what brown got.   It’s 5 million more than marcus smart.   It’s around the same as Myles Turner.   That’s not even close to being a steal. It’s closer to an overpay than it is to a steal.
"Marcus Smart  If he doesn't contribute a lot and consistently, we won't go far"
Marcus Smart man
"Smart.   As in, Marcus Smart."
Marcus Smart
"Wesley Matthew's before his injury, or Marcus Smart"
marcus smart
"Marcus Smart is a PG, power guard."
You just can't ask too much from him. He's a fantastic low responsibility 3rd string PG but if you ask him to do anything more than that he gets flustered.   Most fans are aware that when a player's responsibilities increase their efficiency/effectiveness might decrease but with a lot of role players it's not a linear thing.   With Brad Wanamaker it's like:  1/5 responsibility = 5/5 performance  2/5 responsibility = 4/5 performance  3/5 responsibility = 1/5 performance  He'll hit easy shots at a high clip. He can bring the ball up the court and occasionally make something happen. He's not a star defender but he's so incredibly strong for a PG that no one every really bullies his defence.   In Boston we had 4 guys who could run the offence and score 20 on a whim and we had Marcus Smart as a backup PG. So Brad Wanamaker just needed to be there and he's great if you just need a guy to be there.  Golden State and now Indiana are both teams that need guys to step up. Brad Wanamaker isn't that guy.
"Just to be different as I haven’t seen this name, but Marcus Smart is pretty reliable when switched onto a big. Doesn’t back down at all."
"Marcus Smart and/or Robert Williams. Plenty of other guys we'd like to be able to rely on, but those are the two with the biggest potential roles who we need to step up."
"Back-up point guards who can either defend or shoot will always find a place on the court like Pat Bev, Lou Will, Marcus Smart too (although he's way better than a typical back-up)."
Marcus Smart conundrum.
"&gt; Dame has not made All-Star squads in the west on multiple occasions.        Earlier in his career when there were more deserving people (some questionable obviously). But he's since made all-nba 6 times.      &gt; Marcus Smart has made multiple all-nba defense teams, as has Andre Robertson and Tony Allen. None of those guys are All-stars.  Ben didn't just make all-defense. He made all-nba. All-nba is even *more* elite than being just an all-star since there are only 15 spots from both conferences as opposed to 12 from each conference."
"Dame has not made All-Star squads in the west on multiple occasions. Ben is All-NBA on D but that doesn't necessarily make you an All-star. I am not sure he makes an all-star team in the West many of the seasons he has. To me he is more or less the equivalent of Draymond Green. For instance Marcus Smart has made multiple all-nba defense teams, as has Andre Robertson and Tony Allen. None of those guys are All-stars. You can be all-nba level on D without being an all-star."
Marcus Smart
Marcus Smart
Marcus Smart
"This is riddled with inaccuracies. We got 3 unprotected firsts from Brooklyn in that trade. With the first two we got who most would consider the best player in both drafts at #3 both times. Also one of those picks was split into two to also give us Langford who, if we believe preseason, looks like a high end bench player.   Next, kyrie was not a FA, he was a trade, with a major piece of that trade being the final pick. Marcus smart was drafted with busts all around him rob Williams and Pritchard was late 20s.   We had misses of course, low to medium firsts were not ainges sweet spot, but to be honest, high picks are where championships are built. To say we “underachieved” is grossly premature considering our best asset(and top 5 asset in the league) got to 2 ECFs on his rookie contract and is just now beginning his extension. Everything before now is gravy, now is when we need to achieve, and it only ends when we lose the Tatum/brown core.  Edit: ainge"
I see alot of Marcus Smart in his game.
"His passing numbers are fine. He made more passes per game than Ja Morant, marcus smart, donovan mitchell, terry rozier, Jamal Murray lmao. He had as many potential assists as Murray, Lonzo, Dragic... He's not some crazy ball hog."
"Tatum and brown were fantastic picks, but the celts really botched the rest of the picks IMO.  So many middle to late first rounders and hardly any rotation players came from all that.  Short guards and foreign players who never cracked rotation, James young also comes to mind.  Marcus smart and Rozier are nice but I’ve always though Smart was overrated and they should have kept Rozier instead.  Most other good players they got were all FAs.  Kyrie, Hayward, Theis (solid starter for them), Kemba.  I’d thought they’d be so good with Brad Stephens and all those picks, but between Hayward injury, Kyrie not being the best teammate, and the draft misses they under achieved."
"That draft had the coolest names in the lottery. Dante Exum, Marcus Smart, Jabari Parker, Joel Embiid, Julius Randle, etc etc. Any one of those names could have been a superstar's name. The next LeBron James or Kevin Durant. Hardest draft to pick in imo. Just high potential names all around."
"Marcus ""Notso"" Smart"
Marcus Smart is lol
"Yeah, they should've taken Marcus Smart and picks instead"
"On super low volume, and teams knew it. You’ve also got Marcus Smart on your team and he drew significant attention on the perimeter years before he was actually worth guarding, you should know as well as anyone that having a high 3P% isn’t the same as spacing the floor."
"I could be misremembering, but I'm pretty sure Ben looked like he couldn't dribble whenever he was defended by Marcus Smart during that series."
"So there was a locker room altercation recently and we have no details on who it was between or why it happened, and you automatically go to “Marcus smart is toxic” you make no sense   And you said “Toxic locker room player for a long time” implying that there’s been multiple incidents over time. Well what are they then?"
"Bontemps: Marcus Smart declines to elaborate about his suspension, saying any discussions between him and coach Ime Udoka are going to stay “in-house.”  Woj: LOL He missed the team plane."
"Marcus was suspended for the Orlando game for ""breaking rules""  https://twitter.com/Murf56/status/1448713343880007686 &gt; Marcus Smart, suspended for tomorrow night's game for breaking team rules, is ""remorseful,"" according to Ime Udoka."
"https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/marcus-smart-suspended-for-celtics-next-preseason-game-report/2516881/  I'm not sure if you can open the link, since you don't seem to have internet"
"Celtics fans will hate me, but Marcus smart has been a toxic locker room player for a long time"
"oh my god shut the fuck up. every single marcus smart thread, every single fucking one. enough"
We all knew Marcus Morris wasn't a smart man. Nice of him to confirm it.
"They didn’t outright call him a locker room cancer but they talked about him causing issues for sure.  Marcus Morris on Kyrie and on his experience as a 2020 Knick vs a 2019 Celtic  &gt; He just forgot how big of a leader he was. I think he sometimes forgot that. As a leader, outside stuff can affect our team. And I think that did.  &gt; The teams are different. We don’t have that one guy where it’s like, okay, he’s first. It’s a team thing. No knock on Ky, but obviously he’s a superstar, he’s first. Sometimes his emotions were put in front of the team. I think here, we’re all transparent with each other. We can all go up to each other and be honest with each other. That’s the biggest thing, when you can go out and speak to your brother.  Quotes from Rozier   &gt; I feel like it was more of … it kind of wasn’t coach-player. … It was kind of like coach-younger coach. When he came over (to Boston) he won a championship, him being who he is, Kyrie had a lot of stuff that he felt that could change, that he wanted to change about the Celtics. (These are) all on-court things. He felt like he knew a lot of his basketball. It wasn’t just like them going back-and-forth like, ‘We’re going to do it my way. We’re going to do it your way.’ You could just tell, when Kyrie came he was kind of advanced and he had his little input and he wasn’t holding back. He would say what he felt that we could change or we could do. Sometimes it would work out for us, sometimes it wouldn’t.  &gt; You just have to adjust to his style. Whatever Kyrie wants done, he's gonna show it, that's what he wants done. And you have to adjust to his style of play and how he goes about every game and every day.  &gt; I think guys was getting it, especially toward the end of the season. Like I said, we had come into the game and it'd be a different game plan than what we kind of expected and went through in practice.  Quotes from Smart  &gt; It was huge for us (to see how wrong everything went last year). It was huge because we didn’t want it to happen again. We tried it this way and it didn’t work so the only other option is to go another way, and that’s to not hold stuff in and actually talk. It’s been working for us and we see it. And everybody feels good.  &gt; It’s not that we didn’t know how to act (around him). It’s that we didn’t know how he was going to act. We didn’t know what his moods were and we didn’t know what Kyrie was going through.  &gt; We don’t have to worry about doing stuff on our own. We don’t have to worry about being in our own minds and just think it. We can actually talk. Last year, everybody didn’t know what to say. They didn’t know if they could speak, if they could speak to anybody, or somebody, or a group, and they didn’t know how the reaction would go. It was just different. This year is different. Everybody’s not holding anything in. If we have anything to say, we’re saying it and we’re moving on from it.  All of those quotes were made after the season ended. Jaylen said this all the way back in January, after Kyrie bashed the young guys in the media.  &gt; We've just got to have each other's backs at the end of the day. We can't make comments, we can't point fingers, we just have to continue to empower each other and have each other's backs. If we don't, if we start pointing fingers, everybody's going to go into their own little shells. We've got to continue to play basketball. It starts from the top to the bottom. Not from the bottom to the top, but the top to the bottom."
"Ben is way, way over rated. I seriously hope he goes to Sacramento. Cuz no contender is gona give up an actually valuable asset for him.   Im not a fan of CJ McCollum, but I absolutly would NOT trade him for Ben. If Ben was 27 or 28 this wouldn't even be a discussion. His value is in his age.   He can play defense, but he's an offensive liability. He's a max player, who can't play on the 4th quarter. Well he can't play in the last 4 min at least.    Would you trade Marcus Smart for Ben Simmons right now? FUCK NO. Truth is the fact you'd have to think about that is sad.   Ben's getting paid like KD, Steph, AD, Dame, etc., but he's no where near those guys in actual ability and skill level.   The fact he's doing this, cuz he's in his feelings, is crazy to me. I know it's not easy to handle being in Philly, but that's why he gets paid more than God. I'm not saying the money makes it ok to treat him like shit, but no one has said or done anything crazy in reality. No one has openly disrespected or called him names, in public or in the media.   Everybody's walking on egg shells and he's somehow still offended. It surprised the fuck out of me.   Joel didn't go Gilbert Arenas and pull a gun on him, Doc didn't go Mike Singeltary and call him a loser, Jimmy didn't say anything bad about Ben on his way out. I mean Morrey and Doc, but more so Brand and Brown before that, have built the team around him. They've done everything possible to put him a position to be successful.   He chokes it away, every year, and blames everyone but himself. Like dude you can go thru, and watch his performance in last year's playoffs.   He choked in the 4th quarter of EVERY.SINGLE.GAME vs ATL. He was fucking terrible. I think he had 4 points total for the 4th quarter in that series, and it went like 5 or 6 games, I'm not sure.  Doc and Joel haven't handled this the best, but at the same time, it's no where near as bad as some other coaches, GM's and/or reporters and fans, have been towards other players. And he's in Philly, they fucking boo'd Santa.   I swear this situation is so fucking bizarre. They hurt his feelings cuz he's, single handedly, cost them 2 playoff series' in 3 years now.   You can say the bubble fucked every one up, but last year, without a doubt is on him.   You can argue that if he was a halfway decent offensive player, Philly beats Toronto in '19, and that series doesn't come down to Khawi's buzzer beater.   He's a Tier 2 player, being paid Tier 1A money.   I bet he ends up back in Philly cuz aight no one giving up shit for a point guard, who's owed $150,000,000, and can't shoot. Lmfao he's the most expensive ""hustle and heart"" guy ever. Funny thing is, between last year's playoffs and this off-season, he's proven he has neither.    But what I wana see is how he's gona respond now that it's clear no other GM, or team in general, believes he has any real value. I mean fucking John Wall is on the trading block and Houston isn't willing to part with the corpse of Wall for Simmons. No one masse a real offer for you, and that's gotta hurt a lil.    If I'm Ben, I feel worse now than I did before. But I'll dry my tears with my super max bonus I guess..."
He’d be like a shorter OG with how strong he is. Would be a 1-4 guy easily with his strength similarily to Marcus Smart
"Did a basketball camp out in Ghana with David West, TJ Warren, and Pops Mensah Bonsu(played briefly so u may not remember him). I also was on a team at camp in 8th grade with Marcus Smart."
"If I’m understanding the theme here, why is Marcus Smart a part of this?"
So Marcus Smart is vaccinated?
The bench has some pretty decent defensive utility especially Marcus smart. Andrew Wiggins has some tools to be an elite wing defender as well. But I would agree the starting lineup has too many defensive liabilities
"Yeah I’ve got a bunch of quotes for you.  Morris on [being on the 2020 Knicks vs the 2019 Celtics](https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/ny-marcus-morris-kyrie-irving-boston-celtics-locker-room-20191021-cisa6tvjzrh3blaitezvhymnh4-story.html) and [Kyrie’s leadership](https://www.audacy.com/weei/blogs/nick-friar/morris-backs-kyries-explanation-of-his-last-year-in-boston)    &gt; The teams are different. We don’t have that one guy where it’s like, okay, he’s first. It’s a team thing. No knock on Ky, but obviously he’s a superstar, he’s first. Sometimes his emotions were put in front of the team. I think here, we’re all transparent with each other. We can all go up to each other and be honest with each other. That’s the biggest thing, when you can go out and speak to your brother.  &gt; He just forgot how big of a leader he was. I think he sometimes forgot that. As a leader, outside stuff can affect our team. And I think that did.   Quotes from Rozier [right after the 2019 season](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2836146-celtics-terry-rozier-whatever-kyrie-wants-donethats-what-he-wants-done) (the first 2) and [quotes made the following year](https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/terry-rozier-offers-notable-insight-kyrie-irving-brad-stevens-dynamic)  &gt; You just have to adjust to his style. Whatever Kyrie wants done, he's gonna show it, that's what he wants done. And you have to adjust to his style of play and how he goes about every game and every day.  &gt; I think guys was getting it, especially toward the end of the season. Like I said, we had come into the game and it'd be a different game plan than what we kind of expected and went through in practice.  &gt; I feel like it was more of … it kind of wasn’t coach-player. … It was kind of like coach-younger coach. When he came over (to Boston) he won a championship, him being who he is, Kyrie had a lot of stuff that he felt that could change, that he wanted to change about the Celtics. (These are) all on-court things. He felt like he knew a lot of his basketball. It wasn’t just like them going back-and-forth like, ‘We’re going to do it my way. We’re going to do it your way.’ You could just tell, when Kyrie came he was kind of advanced and he had his little input and he wasn’t holding back. He would say what he felt that we could change or we could do. Sometimes it would work out for us, sometimes it wouldn’t.   [Quotes](https://theathletic.com/1410341/2019/11/26/life-after-kyrie-irvings-moods-actions-forged-a-celtics-team-committed-to-doing-it-differently-this-time/?source=user_shared_article) from Smart  &gt; It was huge for us (to see how wrong everything went last year). It was huge because we didn’t want it to happen again. We tried it this way and it didn’t work so the only other option is to go another way, and that’s to not hold stuff in and actually talk. It’s been working for us and we see it. And everybody feels good.  &gt; It’s not that we didn’t know how to act (around him). It’s that we didn’t know how he was going to act. We didn’t know what his moods were and we didn’t know what Kyrie was going through.  &gt; We don’t have to worry about doing stuff on our own. We don’t have to worry about being in our own minds and just think it. We can actually talk. Last year, everybody didn’t know what to say. They didn’t know if they could speak, if they could speak to anybody, or somebody, or a group, and they didn’t know how the reaction would go. It was just different. This year is different. Everybody’s not holding anything in. If we have anything to say, we’re saying it and we’re moving on from it.  All of these quotes were made after the season ended. But Jaylen said [this](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26702069/kyrie-irving-failed-leadership-tells-story-celtics-failed-season?platform=amp) all the way back in January, following Kyrie bashing them in the media. What he warned of seems to have come to pass based on his teammates’ later quotes.  &gt; We've just got to have each other's backs at the end of the day. We can't make comments, we can't point fingers, we just have to continue to empower each other and have each other's backs. If we don't, if we start pointing fingers, everybody's going to go into their own little shells. We've got to continue to play basketball. It starts from the top to the bottom. Not from the bottom to the top, but the top to the bottom."
Hang on one second I cant hear you over Marcus Smart screaming and throwing things in the locker room.
"Boston acquired more all stars, 3, from 2016-18 than any other NBA team and also drafted Tatum and Brown who became All Stars.   The other recent lottery pick they kept over that time was their 2014 pick, Marcus Smart, who’s an all defensive team member,  If you want ant to you can count their 2015 16th pick, Terry Rozier, who they traded for another All Star, Kemba Walker, in 2019.   They included the 2018 8th pick in the Kyrie trade.  I want someone to tell me which picks that they “fell in love with” they should have traded.   No one will, because they can’t.   It’s just a stupid ESPN narrative."
marcus smart jumped from soooo far away trying to contest that lmao
"Marcus Smart right after Kyrie said he didn't want to be called the n-word  &gt; “Yeah I’ve heard a couple of them. It’s kind of sad and sickening,” Smart said. “Even though it’s an opposing team, you’re saying these racial slurs and you expect us to go out here and play for you. It’s tough.”"
"Rotation depth pieces like Terry Rozier, Marcus, Morris, Aaron Baynes, Marcus Smart, and Daniel Theis?   Our bench was stacked with vets ready to win at one point"
"If anyone is wondering about how toxic Boston sports media is that led to this, Chris Mannix is one of the worst. He repeatedly pushes terribly sourced rumors on the air and just recently said that Brad Stevens and Marcus Smart hated each other... right before Smart signed a new extension on a team friendly deal. Do not trust anything Mannix says."
"Nah it'll always be there. If the hate maintains through the baby jays, smiling kemba, and Marcus smart then I dont think anything can stop it. I am in the same boat"
https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/report-marcus-smart-jaylen-brown-center-celtics-heated-locker-room-incident  and also Ainge getting exposed as a racist
"Honestly, he was the most fun player to watch during that preseason game aside from LaVine. The hustle he puts into the game on both ends is fucking amazing. Defensively he's like Kris Dunn or Marcus Smart in that it's so engaging to watch the way he plays on that end of the floor.  I really feel like AKME did an exceptional job in managing to pick up a quality starting point guard AND a quality sixth man."
"Avery Bradley would’ve been unbeatable if he had Marcus Smart size. His awareness and on-ball defense were top tier, wasn’t a very good scorer but serviceable"
no marcus smart?? smh
"[Let's see what Marcus Smart has to say about the fans nowadays:](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/marcus-smart-nba-boston-celtics-covid-racial-injustice)  &gt; the incident that has stuck with me the most, and that’s had the biggest impact on me, occurred a few years back after a victory at the Garden.  &gt; I was pulling out of the arena parking lot when I saw a white woman with her five- or six-year-old son crossing against the light right as the cars were starting to come at them. I had my windows down and realized something bad was about to happen, so I yelled to her, politely, that she needed to hurry and get out of the street so the two of them wouldn’t get hurt.  &gt; The woman was wearing an Isaiah Thomas number 4 Celts jersey. And there were all these other Celtics fans around who were at the game. I figured she’d be cool.    &gt; Nope.  &gt; She swung her head around and it was….  &gt; “F*** you, you f***ing n-word!!!!”  &gt; For a second it was like I couldn’t breathe.  &gt; Did she really say that?  &gt; And in an instant, just like that, I was made to feel less than human.  &gt; I wasn’t a person to this woman. I was a form of entertainment. Nothing more. And, believe me, it took every ounce of restraint in my body not to curse her out."
"Marcus Smart is what makes me love watching Boston the most. He makes the mundane things fun to watch, creates huge tension when he shoots, insane passes sometimes, and he's the splash brothers equivalent on defense in enjoyability"
marcus smart is an oscar worthy flopper  grant is a porno level actor. dude gets called for a ridiculous amount of fouls and he never fights the refs
Never forget Marcus Smart doing 3 then 0 then 3 on his fingers in Joel's face while Joel tried to trash talk
"""Marcus Smart is screaming in the #Celtics locker room and there is a bunch of arguing going on. Smart comes out say “y’all on that bullshit!” Team is imploding. Smart is in bathroom and there is still screaming coming from locker room."""
"Eh, Tony Allen was never that good. Yeah, an all-defense guy, but Draymond/Gobert are also all-NBA guys. He was never an All-Star.  Allen was more of a Marcus Smart type."
"Yeah idk about plenty.  Pat Bev, Marcus Smart, Jrue, Simmons (if you consider him a guard), maybe Dejounte and Lowry? Certainly not every team has a PG who can do it."
"Hali has size to play the 2 already, though he needs more muscle to guard 3's. Davion's defense looking like Marcus smart already, so I won't be surprised if we run those three at the same time occasionally. I get the size concerns, but this modern NBA now. I'd rather see the potential we have with those 3 fan favorites than take a flyer on a toxic guy that can't shoot.  Running the shit out of the ball sounds nice, but it has a ceiling. We saw this unfold during Fox's sophomore year where we played the fastest pace and could've made the playoffs. Once teams caught on in the 2nd half of the season, our half court offense got exposed and it was hard to watch.   We need a guy that can shoot and playmake like Hali and we don't know his true potential yet. I say we run it back. We ain't the ones desperate for a trade."
"yeah, off the list completely? Give me DLo over Marcus Smart, Mike Conley, Westbrook and in the mix with Fox and Lowry (and push Murray up to 6 jeez)"
Marcus smart above either ball brother ??? That’s clown shit
They really put Russ on Marcus Smart tier lol
Marcus Smart over Brogdon? Seriously?
Overrated: Marcus Smart  Underrated: KAT
We already knows what happens when someone says something hugely offensive to him in person: [he writes a Players' Tribune article about it.](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/marcus-smart-nba-boston-celtics-covid-racial-injustice)
"That’s facts tho, Celtics players bitch at the officials so much. Especially Marcus Smart, like when he got escorted out the game cause he called the ref a pussy  Brad Stevens never really argued with the officials, he kinda let it escalate to where the players did it instead. Udoka seems to command a lot more control over his players and I think that’s huge."
"Marcus Smart doesn't complain about calls as much as Tatum, or really any scorer. He just flops. But if he flops and doesn't get the call, he doesn't bitch about it."
Tell Marcus Smart through the television and I'm pretty sure he'll still mess you up
"Hell, tell Marcus Smart to his face, let us know how it goes."
By players he means Marcus Smart
The Celtics when 10-2 when Marcus Smart recorded over 8 assists. Have you seen this year’s roster ?
"yes, all defense marcus smart not full time PG marcus smart"
You mean all defensive nba Marcus Smart ?
"C'S starting PG is marcus smart lol, unless we get Point Tatum this year"
"Al Horford back, Marcus Smart contract extension, Ime Udoka coaching.  Must be a nice change of pace for Celtics fans from a few years ago lol"
"&gt;The Celtics were one win away from the finals without Kyrie, then he had the nerve a season later to say publicly that the young Celtics guys don't know what it takes to be a championship winning team.  I don't think people appreciate how insane that game was. Terry Rozier and Marcus Smart combined to shoot 7-26 in that game and 0-14 from three. If they had even a *normal* bad game (like if Rozier goes 5-14/3-10) instead of 2-14/0-10) they would have beaten LeBron's Cavs and gone to the Finals *without Kyrie.*"
is he consistently this good? i’ve heard his rep but never seen it like this i guess  those hands are insaneee. fearless positioning and footwork. some of the chase-downs and half court help d really stuck out  wondering how raptor fans would compare him to someone like marcus smart
Marcus Smart was his roommate?
Mikal hunter OG Og is very clearly just a role player I think hunter has the potential to be marcus smart+ mikal I think can be jaylen brown lite
Marcus Smart without the skill/IQ... aka Marcus Dumb
"I think Giannis and Gobert gotta be in that conversation too. Marcus Smart maybe?   Edit: Sorry, just saw the original claim was ""wing defenders"", not just defenders in general"
"I only watched the first half of this game but it was UGLY. And for a good reason, rookies kept making rookie mistakes. Celtics vets were just toying with them, especially Marcus Smart. Magic will probably be top 3 worst teams this season."
*cough cough* Marcus Smart *cough cough*
Marcus Smart got all 8 fines
&gt; Boston Celtics: Extended Marcus Smart  Also the whole Brad Stevens becoming GM and hiring Ime Udoka
"But it's still not enough offense, you have to ship out sabonis for a good offensive player. Maybe something like:       marcus smart to the jazz      sabonis to the celtics      jordan clarkson and aaron nesmith to the pacers.  I don't think this makes enough sense but maybe it could be tweaked"
Marcus Smart making 5 straight three pointers against the Raptors in the 4th quarter of game 2
Marcus Smart
"Unfortunately is it also my favourite player, Marcus Smart.   He is getting hard to watch."
Marcus Smart. He is incredibly polarizing. You have no idea what you are going to get from him night to night.
Marcus Smart.
Not a single Marcus smart wow
Marcus Smart
"Would be lucky to get Marcus Smart and Robbie Williams for Simmons, and I still wouldn’t do that deal as the Celtics. Morey is high"
"""Pass me the ball guys please, I'll make the shot"" - Marcus ""Career 37/32/78 shooter"" Smart"
I would welcome this insane timeline where Marcus Smart 3s became our big game plan.
Tatum lmao.  He probably would’ve loved to play with Marcus Smart though
please free marcus smart from that dumpster fire org and get him over to our dumpster fire
Marcus smart about to lose his job too hahaha
Marcus Osmond Smart
I mean... is this the worst thing in the world?  &amp;#x200B;  Marcus Smart just accused the two wings of basically hogging all the shots.  &amp;#x200B;  If they traded Brown for Simmons at least we know he wouldn't be doing that. ;)
People act like Marcus Smart doesn't just shoot when he pleases
"Ben Simmons is everything your team needs.  A point guard that would assist Marcus Smart 3's.  Duplicating talented players will only lead to disaster.  ^- ^ESPN, ^probably"
"Yo, if I'm the Sixers, I straight up offload Ben for Marcus Smart. Same player with less length but way better teammate with much lower salary. You can start over that way. It's dumb to ask for the moon and have his toxic ass sitting in your community's local fish wrapper's gossip section."
"We'll be happy to take Jaylon Brown or Jayson Tatum plus Marcus Smart for Ben Simmons and Grant Riller.   Win-Win all around!  If we get either of the Jays straight up for Ben, I won't need Christmas for the rest of the decade!  Please Boston, let us fleece you for the Fultz/Tatum fleecing you did to us."
"The man passed out of a wide open layup that's defended by Trae Young and you want to put him on the block.  But then, what if he passed it out to Marcus Smart...?"
"Don't forget ""heart and soul of the team"" Marcus Smart."
Marcus Smart is about to learn the hard way that criticizing Jaylen and Tatum is not a smart thing to do.   I am hoping the Celtics are not going to include Tatum and Brown in any Simmons trade. Smart + picks + something will be a good trade for them
"That Celtics team the next season consisted of Kyrie Irving, Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, and Shane Larkin. They were not gonna take another guard"
"He’s having one of his worst shooting years of his career  31.2% FG (8.6 attempts per game) - career low  28.3% 3P (5.9 attempts per game)  70% FT  44.9% TS (career low)  Has never shot 43% from the field in his career, has never shot 37% from 3 in his career, has shot above 50% from 2 once in his career  He’s not a great finisher, doesn’t really have a mid-range game, and career is 31.9% from 3 (over the last 3 seasons it’s 33.6%).  He’s got a decent floater and can hit timely shots and can be streaky where he looks good, but he has entirely been getting by on his reputation on defense at this point. I wouldn’t call him a shooter outside of any context other than “yeah, he takes a lot of shots”  Part of his bad numbers is his shot selection, and any Celtics fan will tell you he’s the one guy on the team that you go “Nooooo” anytime he throws up a badly timed 3, only to be redeemed by the roulette of it going in. That’s the Marcus Smart experience and has been from the beginning."
Marcus Smart: I want a teammate who thinks pass first.  [Monkey paw curls]
"“Why can’t you motherf@ckers always pass to me?” —Marcus smart, literally."
"The days of expecting an all star level return for Simmons are over, but that's not an issue for the Sixers. They're seeing they can win games just fine without him.  The issue now becomes replacing this $33 million dollar hole on their roster with a player that provides playmaking, defense, both of which Simmons has in spades, with the propensity for a 3 pt shot here and there, which Simmons does not have.   **That's why my money is on a package being built around Marcus Smart and the deal happening in early 2022.**  Again, Sixers can win without Simmons, but having a guy like Smart certainly elevates their defense. For the Celtics, Brad's whole system (and he's the boss now, don't forget) was built around switch everything defense. A 6'10"" PG would be perfect for that.   I think this JB report is just Morey playing mind games with Brad ahead of the trade and trying to squeeze another asset into the trade"
&gt; he won't and can't shoot threes  Your backcourt would be Ben Simmons and Marcus Smart. I can't even can't even.
Well at least Marcus Smart won't complain about Simmons not passing the ball
"Eh, I mean Al Horford may be washed and Aaron Nesmith may be a bust but given larger sample sizes both are most definitely going to be better 3 point shooters than Simmons.  Simmons has actually managed to have Marcus Smart type efficiency from the arc the last 2 years on paper (.300 and .286) but that's on 17 attempts and with, I'm guessing, no one within 8 feet of him for almost all of those shots. He has still never hit a playoff 3, he's famously averse to effectively taking coaching on his 3 point shooting, and is famously afraid to shoot.  Moreover it's not just 3s. Last year Simmons only took 15 shots from further than 14 feet out. From 10-14 feet he was 11/37 for a 29.7% FG%. His spacing issues aren't just a matter of his limitations at the arc, he's just not much of a threat to shoot until he gets within 10 feet. That's a huge problem for Smart, but it's an even bigger problem for a star player you try to build your team around.  Al Horford's taken 40 shots from &gt;14 feet out *this* season. Last year he shot 50% from 10-14 feet on 28 attempts and 43.8% from 15-19 feet on 32 attempts.  And, of course, Simmons is a star player who's on the ball a lot so his shooting limitations represent a particularly big impact.  Importantly I think the book on how to make use of Simmons is pretty clear: ideally you'd surround him with guys who can shoot making it easy to open up the lane and maximizing the spacing you can get with him on the floor. The Celtics, um, can't do that, especially if they're shipping out Brown.  The team that trades for Simmons should be a team that's particularly good at shooting the 3, not particularly bad at it."
Who in the flying fuck thought we wanted Marcus smart lmao outside of the jays they don’t have shit they knew morey’s asking price. And Simmons has multiple tweets salivating over Ben
Fire Marcus Smart into the sun to make this happen.  Jaylen Brown is a funny ask.  He's arguably better than Tatum.
Brad stevens about give up Marcus Smart and Jaylrn Brown for Ben Simmons.    Side note: Smart and Embid on the same team should be fun.
&gt; If the Sixers manage to pry Brown from the Celtics with Simmons' trade value at an all-time low  lmao let me stop you right there. That's exactly the moment the Celtics hung up the phone.  The deal would be like Marcus Smart + filler + a 1st round pick. And that's probably the best the Sixers could do in this moment (until Ben comes back and plays well).
Maybe the sixers are going to get lucky here because this would be a huge mistake by Boston if they trade jaylen or Tatum   I don’t even think Boston has another guy that philly would want unless there’s a Marcus smart plus a ton of picks trade here
"The trade would be for Marcus Smart, plus picks and depth pieces"
Marcus smart is the only thing that makes sense for the Celtics to get rid of. Anything else is an overpay.
"Yes I would probably trade Marcus Smart for Ben Simm--hold on, what? You said Jaylen--? Hahahauahah no."
"Marcus Smart. He takes so many dumb shots it out weighs all the good things he does. Other fan bases just see the highlights and defensive intensity. They don't see the blown assignments, the 30 foot early shot clock 3 that clangs off the backboard."
They’re gonna try to trade Marcus smart
"""Why can't you guys pass like him?"" - Marcus Smart probably"
rubio for marcus smart who says no
The Sixers make it too easy.  Like if they said Marcus Smart plus filler would yall disagree with that price.  Edit:  I don't think Smart can get traded because he extended nvm.
"Why Marcus smart? I get pat bev, because he's a bit of a dick but Marcus smart is just a great defender and of course he's not the only one in the league so why single him out?"
If you go take a look at r/bostonceltics you’ll find that Marcus Smart is both.
Lol Bale turned into Marcus Smart without me realizing it
Marcus Smart.   Lots of Celtics fans would love it if he played for another team.
Right now it’s also Marcus Smart
GP2 is what Marcus Smart used to be to his team.
Dort  Ben Simmons  Marcus Smart  Jrue Holiday  Lonzo Ball  Kawhi  Giannis  Thybulle Butler   Caruso  Payton II
"On the perimeter I honestly don’t think he’s that bad. Anybody other than Marcus Smart/Chris Paul is gonna have a hard time in the post at that height. Cole provides scoring at an efficiency that neither of those guys can provide tho (with 3 pters, I know CP3 is lethal from middie). I will take that offense and defense everyday."
i was listening to the bulls broadcast last night and they pointed out how well the team is doing and how deep they look with just 8 available players and maybe being a piece or two away from being a contender.  And then they were like how do you NOT want to be part of that?  Kind of hit home when guys outside the situation lay it out like that.  He way overreacted to some comments that probably shouldn't have been said but were pretty minor in the grand scheme of things.  Marcus smart yesterday said his teammates are selfish and dont pass the ball thats like dropping a nuke compared to what doc said but Tatum and Brown arent throwing hissy fits.  People will still want Ben but he has ruined his reputation
"well here is me I would say ""Not Marcus Smart"" because he declined so much defensively its sad."
Marcus Smart
I’m thinking Marcus Smart is out of here this season. Smart have a major contract now that he can be traded.
It's weird how it's like certain guys just get a free pass to reach and hand check. Marcus Smart is another one that gets to just foul constantly.
"I'm not making an excuse for why they're bad at creating for others, I'm explaining why Marcus Smart isn't correct in calling them out.  Them being selfish isn't why their offense is bad this year.  It's bad because they don't have a real point guard on the team.  Much like Kerr wouldn't ask Klay Thompson to create all the offense for others, why do fans/redditors expect Jaylen Brown to be doing that.  It's perfectly okay for a shooting guard to average 3-4 assists and pass the ball within the offense.  But if the option is to swing the ball to Marcus Smart or take a somewhat uncontested 3 himself, there's no reason to over pass.  I know there's the philosophy of turning a good shot into a great shot, but a good shot from Brown is worth more than a great shot from pretty much anyone else on the current roster.  Same reason why your fan base would rather have Steph or Klay take somewhat open shots over Draymond taking wide open shots."
https://kingsherald.com/articles/nba-trade-rumors-boston-celtics-marcus-smart-trade-sacramento-kings-harrison-barnes-nemanja-bjelica-trade/  I also remember Sam amick mentioning it on a radio show with the trade deadline nearing
"Marcus ""Not So"" Smart"
"We can't trade Smart yet either, so wanna do a handshake deal swapping Terry and Marcus at the deadline lol"
maybe someone like marcus smart  or porzingis  truth is they are stuck with him for at least this season.   i think they just need to essentially use his as a 6th man without actually bringing him off the bench

Has the be one of the most ironic things in NBA history for someone named Marcus Smart to have a habit of doing dumb shit.
"Good leaders lead by example. Celtics fans loved to bash Kyle Lowry and put smart on a pedestal. Yet Lowry is a consummate pro, unselfish, and leads by example instead of running his mouth and chucking ill advised shots. If Marcus smart is your leader you ain't winning no titles, there I said it."
"Smart is definitely a mixed bag of the best and worst defensive plays at the end of games I have ever seen. He gave the final shot to the Mavs, but also took the final shot away from Charlotte this season, too, which ended up being a win. Not at the end of a game, but he heaved with lots of time on the clock that one time, but also orchestrated one of James Harden's most iconic offensive meltdowns. On the balance, if we took every positive and negative clutch defensive play for Marcus Smart, I think we come up positive or at the very least neutral."
Classic Marcus smart. Calls out Tatum and brown and proceeds to hail bricks and make boneheaded mistakes.
Marcus Not That Smart
Marcus Smart for Westbrick please we’ll throw in any picks you want
Marcus Smart. For the opposing team.
Marcus Not-So-Smart
Marcus not so Smart
"Marcus ""winning plays"" smart."
Marcus “isn’t” Smart or Marcus “not so” Smart
Marcus isn’t smart
Idk on one side the hornets desperately need defense on the other end we already have enough bad contracts. Terry rozier and mason plumlee for al horford and marcus smart.  edit: Nvm forgot we cant trade terry yet
"Amazing shot but I can't help but wonder what would have happened if Marcus ""Smart"" didn't foul Luka in the backcourt with 5 seconds on the shot clock 11 on the game clock. That horrible, horribly foul gave Luka the much needed extra time and means the Celtics (who had 2 time outs) didn't get to take the last shot."
I just realized I'm Marcus Smart.
_With special acknowledgements to Marcus Smart._
Marcus “not so” Smart?
"Just need to add a middle name.   Marcus ""not very"" Smart"
"Marcus ""not so"" Smart."
Marcus Smart has less than half a brain cell confirmed.
"Shout out to Marcus Smart, a man who hasn't improved a single aspect of his game in 4 years but somehow has the self-assuredness to call out the development of the actual good players on the team in front of the media.  I wish all of us could feel this type of delusional confidence no matter how fucking dreadful we are at what we do."
I love it too. Great to see them not calling shit like that. Marcus Smart sucks.
"Not talking about the defense, it was well contested but Luka makes impossible shots. I don’t get Marcus Smart fouling him and letting the shot clock reset to give him the last shot though."
And they say Marcus Smart is a good defender. Overrated garbage
Marcus “not so” Smart
Defensive specialist Marcus Smart making the worse defensive play of the night.
Marcus ^not Smart
"marcus ""username doesn't check out"" smart"
"And also gave away our last possession 🤦🏽‍♂️  Live by Marcus Smart, die by Marcus Smart"
Is this going to be a shit on Marcus Smart thread? Hold on lemme get my popcorn
Marcus Smart is worth a $77M extension btw. Heart and soul of the team btw.
Marcus Smart stinking it up ever since he made that comment
"Marcus Smart is an idiot bro. Theres 18 seconds remaining, Dallas ball and the shot clock is at 12. Why would you take a foul and let them turn the clock off to take the last shot of the game???"
Don't ever tell me Marcus Smart makes winning plays. What a bone headed foul to give the Mavs the last shot.
Does Marcus Smart have brain damage?
Marcus Smart shouldn't have fouled!
Not even mad. Great game!  Edit: Except for the last 2 dumb shit Marcus Smart did
"Yeah, that's fine. But the question here that Morey is answering is basically ""What is the difference between a 1st round playoff loss and a 2nd round playoff loss?"" And he's answering it with ""Not much.""   Unless a player moves the needle significantly towards ""Championship"" then there's no reason to make that deal.   And let's be honest here...the difference between *this* Simmons-less 76ers team and healthy versions of Miami, Milwaukee, and Brooklyn is not negligible right now. Marcus Smart and parts doesn't move that needle. Jerami Grant doesn't move that needle.  Neither of those guys gets you to the conference finals, let alone to a title. Maybe it puts you ahead of Chicago or Charlotte or Atlanta in round 1, but **maybe not.**   That's not good enough. It's better to lose in round 1 with Simmons sitting at his house than lose in round 2 with Jerami Grant. The downgrade in championship equity is massive there."
Marcus Smart. I used to hate him for his flopping but now that they changed the rules on officiating it has cut down on trying to draw fans. I can now appreciate Marcus Smart’s talent because now she’s just concentrating on using skills.
"Weird thinking Marcus Smart goes to Turner’s Seafood, that wait staff must see a lot of famous people."
"Franchise player Marcus Smart, what would the Celtics be without him around!!!"
"https://youtu.be/QJHUbtR0yI8  Fr tho he’s consistently a defensive stud, and he’s a good passer. Solid 3 ball too. Everything else is iffy   I think he can be a Marcus Smart / Lonzo type player. He’s a dog"
"At the very least, all-nba defensive team.   He deserved it last year too, but since he wasn’t a starter, he wasn’t part of the conversation.   He’s proven himself to be in the same level level defensively as guys like Thybull, Marcus Smart and Jrue Holiday."
"Similar sentiment that Marcus smart said. Said he could've maybe waited, but settinghis family up for long term  money right now, is more demanding."
Marcus Smart outplayed every player on your team lol
"If you're consistently getting beat off the dribble by Marcus Smart, your team has no chance, especially with all the good guards in the west"
"This team refuses to box out or put in the bare minimum effort. Once again we get outrebounded, and watch dudes like Marcus Smart or Josh Richardson just out hustle both our guards and bigs to loose balls and offensive rebounds."
"Marcus Smart, making things happen."
marcus smart needs a spanking for jumping on a russ westbrook pump fake 3
My hard hitting basketball analysis is that Marcus Smart is an exceptional on ball defender
sheesh marcus smart having himself a game
Marcus smart tearing us a new asshole smh
"Dejounte Murray, Marcus Smart, Lonzo Ball, and Gary Trent Jr. are all guards who are better defenders than curry too.  &gt;Not to mention, through 15 games Stephs D isnt bad and could improve, it has been anyway  His defense has been solid for a few years, he exerts an impressive amount of effort on that side of the ball. It's part of what separates him from players like Lillard. He's still not close to being an all-defense selection though.  &gt;I dont think he will get all defense, but its just stupid to say he cant.  I didn't say he can't. I said it'd be possibility because voters love him (e.g. 3rd place in MVP voting as a non-playoff team last year). I could definitely see him getting the nod over somebody more deserving like Vanvleet or Trent Jr."
I always thought Marcus smart was that guy?
"There’s a Marcus Smart debate after every single Celtics game, no matter whether he plays well or poorly."
"&gt; Also, there's likely an issue when a player like Marcus Smart is openly criticising to the public that those two don't want to pass the ball.  Incredibly overblown by the media   &gt; If you're suggesting the Clippers have an issue with the PG/Kawhi pairing, we don't.  If you're suggesting that the Celtics have an issue with the Jays pairing, we don't."
"It's hard to get good talent when teams can offer the players you want more money because you're paying 60 million a year for Tatum and Brown. Also, there's likely an issue when a player like Marcus Smart is openly criticising to the public that those two don't want to pass the ball.  Don't get so defensive 😂 If you're suggesting the Clippers have an issue with the PG/Kawhi pairing, we don't. We aren't falling short of expectations. We lost Kawhi in the WSCF. Who knows what happens last year if Kawhi didn't bust his knee against the Jazz."
"This reminds me of the time when this happened during a Sixers game the year Jimmy Butler was there. Butler got a steal and the ball boy was mopping up sweat and couldn’t get out of the way, so Butler used the ball boy to set a pick on Marcus Smart and then passed it to Simmons for the easy dunk. Butler was impressed by the ballboy’s intangibles on offense and recruited him to come to Miami. That ball boy’s name? Tyler Herro."
"Is Patrick Beverly on a Mac, is Jrue Holiday, is Marcus smart? That is some terrible reasoning by you, if Ben Simmons gets a mac then it means you can’t give one to a good offensive scorer. Draymond doesn’t have a max because he doesn’t score.  Golbert is on a Mac because he gets points and plays defense, same with Giannis."
Paul George? Marcus Smart? Eric Gordon? Avery Bradley?
So let's go with your plan.  Trade Ben for Marcus Smart or someone comparable.  Surely that will save Embiid's prime.

Hello I also don't get the Marcus Smart hype.  BuT wInNiNg PlAys
Marcus Smart about to do something crazy
"Boston basically dared the team outside of Trae to be…well NBA players tonight. Didn’t work out.   That was pretty much the strategy in the playoffs. Guaranteed 10+ assists for Trae and if he starts hitting the tough 3s (that he bricked tonight) while you play aggressive defense you can basically say goodnight. They did a really good job on him and outside of 1 or 2 three balls they were all contested. Also forced him into some “wtf” passes.  No disrespect intended, truly, but I’ll never understand why Marcus Smart is as revered as he is league wide. It’s not like his stat sheet was horrendous but all of the actual defensive work was done by Schroeder and Horford while Marcus let all 3 of our wings get hot at different points in the game, which was the actual back breaker considering how well the Trae was defended"
Brad Stevens thought Marcus Smart is worth a massive extension and Josh Richardson also deserved an extension. Such a brilliant basketball mind.
That Marcus Smart contract looking like doodoo
"""Celtics make the Smart choice, hire Marcus to coach team made up entirely of Jays"" - SI 2030"
"The two Jays need to pass. - Marcus Smart as a HC, probably."
I nominate 1 from the Celtics: Marcus Smart
"Boston isn't trading us Marcus Smart, I don't care if Brad Stevens is new to his job or if he doesn't know the rivalry.  Also, I would flip Hield to San Antonio for a DeRozan sign and trade if Popovich is willing."
and if he responded in any way that wasnt the nuclear option people would say it is exactly what he needed to here to turn his game around.  The response is an 11/10 while the criticism is like a 2/10 considering how much they have catered to him throughout his career.  This response is also coming from the guy who said his biggest weakness was not being held accountable.  Finally gets held accountable... NO NOT LIKE THAT 😡  Jaylen and Tatum should be blowing up on their team any moment based on what Marcus Smart just said that is 100x worse than anything Doc or Embiid said.  Just because the response was handled as poorly as can be does not make the comments worse.
"a Jrue Holday / Marcus Smart type who is 6’10 lol, yes he has insane impact on the defensive end like them"
Ben has gotten significantly overrated. He's a good defender but the idea he has as much impact as Draymond or Gobert is just silly. He's more of the Jrue Holiday / Marcus Smart type. Great but not carrying a teams defense either. And those guys don't cripple your teams offense
"Well then he’s gonna have the same problems elsewhere because everyone does that. Marcus Smart just called out Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown like last week. Anthony Edwards called out Kat and Dlo. That’s what Teammates do when asked a specific question. None of them sulked and ghosted the team like Ben though, instead they listened and got better."
Marcus Smart should definitely never lead our team in shot attempts.
who is telling marcus smart to take this many dogshit shots
honestly it makes sense. Lakers fans even followed this guy through his G-league stint; he's that fan favorite like Marcus Smart for Boston.
"Still better than Marcus Smart shooting percentage, and that says a lot"
"Well clearly Tatum needs to take more shots to score as many as KD. Keep chucking them up JT. Don't listen to Marcus ""not so"" Smart. Lol"
Why is Zach trying to Dribble through the double? Bulls need a Marcus Smart team meeting.
You mean the team that has a yearly episode where Marcus Smart has to scream at the Jays for them to get their shit together?   Idk bout that one chief
"Dejounte Murray, but he's not available.  I've been screaming for ages to get Ricky Rubio on the Celtics, but Brad Stevens is using this season to see if Marcus Smart can play a Ricky Rubio role (he can't).  Rubio's a free agent this offseason and they'll try to get him there."
They’re too busy writing theee page essays on why Marcus Smart is actually the best player in the league
"&gt;Come on People hunt Steph all the time. He's perfectly fine for a PG, but he's not a good defender.  Steph Curry is actually a pretty good defender, the only reason he's hunted is because he was surrounded by 4 all nba level defender in Green, Klay, Iggy and KD.  You could put KCP or Lowry in that lineup and they would still be  hunted by the likes of Harden, Lillard, Kyrie etc. Modern NBA offenses systematically target the weakest link in the opposing teams defense but that doesnt automatically imply your a bad defender just because you get targeted, if the weakest link in your defense is steph curry then you're doing pretty good.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Guards just don't have that much impact on your defense in the modern NBA - that's why Klay missing doesn't matter   Tell that to Jrue Holiday or Marcus Smart lol, Jrue defense on CP3 was one the biggest reasons the bucks beat the suns  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;The vast majority of modern defense is scheme + having mobile big men that can protect the rim and so play high in the PnR.   But guys who can execute a wide variety of defensive schemes are known as impactful defenders, having strong defensive anchors are obviously important but you still need high level perimeter defenders if you want your defense to hold up against high level offensive teams. You can have AD anchoring your defense and it wouldn't matter if he's surrounded by the like of JR Smith or Luke Kennard"
Marcus smart
Man Marcus smart is dogshit
"Both Marcus Smart and Ricky Rubio have amazing basketball IQ and are elite defenders with three point making capabilities. On this play, Rubio outsmarts Smart. Rubio looks at the post where Schroeder was already defending and Smart anticipates a pass there and goes to double or possibly intercept the pass but Rubio then throws a relatively no look lob to Allen. Great awareness by Rubio."
Matches the eye test. Bro has been gunning all year. The game where Marcus smart complained Tatum legit didn’t pass in the fourth and was gunning every trip down the floor.
Marcus Smart doing Marcus Smart things.
Just Marcus smart things.
Someone in game thread said marcus smart is going foul during timeout
Marcus Smart really is a wild card.
Hasn't Marcus smart literally gone flying off the court in some cases lol
Marcus Smart falls asleep on defence a lot off ball for someone with his reputation.
"Great defensive decision by Marcus ""heart and soul"" Smart"
"...have you watched the games?  Marcus Smart has not at all been the beast he once was on defense.  He wasn't last year and definitely not this year.  Not saying Caruso should be the one to replace him, though he has a good argument tbh.  But Smart should definitely not be on there"
Marcus Smart is ahead of Caruso. Jokic ahead of Gobert is just trolling I assume.
I wish Marcus Smart called my teachers out in class
The lesson here is A) small sample sizes are awesome and B) Marcus Smart needs to run his mouth more.

"I can’t tell if this is joking or not, in which case this is a whoosh moment for me. But in case it’s serious, then I’ll say this:  Just going off of PG defenders you can easily say jrue holiday and Marcus smart are better defenders, as well as dunn. FVV is probably better as well defensively. Beverly.   If you expanded it to guards in general then obviously LU dort and thybulle overtake steph as well.   Steph is a good defender but there are better PG and guard defenders in the league for sure."
"The Boston Celtics OBLITERATE the defending champion Milwaukee Bucks behind WINNING performances from team LEADERS Jayson Tatum and Marcus Smart.    The Celtics held superstars Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton to ZERO points combined.  This was all done without Jaylen Brown, who was suspiciously ABSENT from the Celtics lineup with what is *alleged* to be a hamstring injury.  This performance begs the question: *are the Celtics better without Jaylen Brown?*  and certainly gives support to the whispers of respectable but yet-unnamed r/nba shitposters who insist that a Jaylen Brown for Ben Simmons trade is imminent."

If Celtics lose its Implosion incoming. Marcus Smart gonna chug Deuce Tatum into the trash can
Marcus Smart lockerroom tirade incoming
"I'd trust Rodman guarding Jokic and Embiid. Rodman was so strong. Much stronger than his frame would suggest, and he was quick with great footwork. He had that Marcus Smart defensive mentality with the physical profile of Giannis.   I think you're right that offensively he'd be a bit of a black hole. I can't really argue against that, because he didn't really have much skill on that end of the court. But if the question is whether or not he'd be the best defender in the league today, then I think there's absolutely an argument that he would be.   Might he be sat in crunch time? Probably if his team was down, but definitely not if his team were up. He was a really special defender, and there's alway room for guys who can singlehandedly disrupt an opposing team's offensive game plan."
"https://youtu.be/-a_fcaNnKMM  I was curious so I looked up those instances. I’m not sure how marcus smart punks him here lol. Smart pushes him, butler and smart go face to face, then its separated. It’s just 2 competitors getting a bit heated, nothing else. Butler doesn’t even seem that upset, or start the altercation, so I find this to be an odd example to use.  Also saying “nene almost ended him” seems extremely dramatic. Would nene beat butler in a fight? Probably. But a fight never even broke out between the two so it’s a bit dramatic to say he almost ended him. If anything, him not backing down from a bigger guy who outmatches him is evidence against your point."
"Handchecking has always been legal, you just need the reputation of a good defender and you're golden  Jrue Holiday, Kawhi, Marcus Smart handcheck more than people did in the 90s, Kawhi especially in the DPOY years his signature defending move was to put his massive hand on someone at all time"
"&gt; If Gobert has a remotely decent jab that's easier said than done.   A decent jab for a guy who hits pads once a week, or a decent jab for an actual boxer?   I have a decent jumper for a guy who plays pickup ball, and I've been playing basketball since I was 5. It doesn't mean I'd make more 3s in an actual NBA game than, say Marcus Smart - or even your average D-II backup SG."
Marcus Smart comes to mind.
My favorite part of that Marcus smart - Jimmy Butler thing is that Terry Rozier immediately came in. Terry Rozier is pretty much gang affiliated and is probably actually about that. His IG literally starts off gmbrozier. Gmb for get money boyz.
Go on YouTube and look up the jimmy B altercation reel. He never does anything. His confidence level skyrockets x1000 once there’s 30 people between him and the other guy. Nene almost ended him and Marcus smart punked him as a rookie.
"The WILD thing is that I think Boston could get him without Brown or Tatum if this keeps escalating. Morey is playing chicken with front offices and more power to him, but at what point does he not think, ""Okay, I can work with Marcus Smart on a manageable contract"" for a bit if the team is already good. Smart is gonna be a playoff stud somewhere. He's just a dick who has no shot atm."
"I think Marcus Smart, plus young prospects, plus picks would have to be considered. I think that would be better than any package around Dlo. Since Philly is still a contender, I think Smart could fit right in as a big defensive point guard/wing."
Hey now theyre doomed for not accepting a trade for Marcus Smart and Rob Williams /s
"The Clippers certainly did. Not “any chance they got” but enough for it to be notable. It wasn’t just my eye test either. It got explicitly mentioned in the article from the athletic previewing the bucks/Suns finals:  &gt; Who’s guarding Khris Middleton? No matter who it is — Mikal Bridges likely — the Bucks would be smart to hunt Booker like the Clippers did. Marcus Morris Sr. was cooking in the mid-post against Booker. The Clippers shot 51 of 96 when Booker was defending. That 53.1 percent shooting was 6.2 percent higher than their collective average. No Suns player defended more Clippers attempts than Booker, by design."
Lmao. Let's get Marcus Smart and John Collins in here too
"Nobody trading Dame or Jaylen Brown for Ben Simmons  Simmons prob yield a return in the likes of Marcus Smart and asset, Deaaron Fox and something, CJ MCollum and assets,   Hawks is interesting tho, I don’t think they want to pay Reddish so he could be a trade piece, John Collins doesn’t make enough money as Simmons and he’s kinda important for the Hawks as a versatile scorer and just overall great lockerroom leader..there’s some intangibles and offensive off ball skillset that compliment Trae better. I’d pair Simmons and Trae only if Trae is an excellent off ball player, which Trae is not, he’s ok, but not that good off ball, you actually want Trae on ball."
"So let’s say they do this trade, JB for Simmons and like 3 first round picks. How would they know that Simmons would even play? Better yet what happens when Marcus Smart dogs Simmons in the media for not shooting enough?"
Three way trade:      ben simmons/seth curry/porzingis/sixers firsts to the celtics      marcus smart/time lord to the mavs      jaylen/jrich to the sixers  I think this is actually decent and probably makes the celtics better in the short run. I still don't do it if I'm the celtics tho.
"Lmfaaooo, Celtics really offered Marcus Smart after that press conference xP"
I think they’re just as delusional if they thought we were going to accept Marcus fucking smart for Ben Simmons lmao
"Why? Orlando is in a rebuild they want young players , rj hamptom this season 18 mpg 7.5 ppg with 42%FG,  marcus smart this season 35 mpg with 9 ppg and 32%FG!"
"yeah cuz jayson tatum, jaylen brown, marcus smart, terry rozier, payton pritchard, and robert williams were wasted draft picks! good point guy! got me there!"
Marcus smart had acne and picked it too much when he was a teenager
Damn marcus smart what a shot
Marcus Smart is shutting down Trae young for an entire series lmao. First team all defense for a reason.  Good luck having Cam and Hunter on Tatum. Dropping 30+ nightly. Tatum averaged 27/11/6 on Butler last year in the playoffs. Gonna be a murder lmaoooooooo
"Nobody to stop Tatum? I guess Deandre and Cam stopped existing 😂. And I definitely will. Marcus Smart is a good defender but he ain’t shutting down Trae for a whole series sorry not sorry. Trae has weapons around him now, you can focus all on Trae if you want the rest of the team will feast then"
"Spoelstra got further last year with Butler, Bam, and Dragic than Brad stevens did with Kyrie, Tatum, Brown, Horford, Hayward, Smart, Rozier, and Marcus Morris lmao."
Lowry is actually better than stats shows. His hustle and leadership make him such an impactful player. Him and Marcus Smart are so much better than what the boxscores show.
Better: Marcus Smart  Worse: John Wall
"Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry and Marcus Smart have to be on any list. If your team is playing them, all that flopping and vet savvy foul drawing will drive you up a wall."
you live by the marcus smart.
"Harrisson Barnes , Marcus Smart , Joe Harris Brook Lopez and Kemba Walker are gonna end up being the starting 5."
fucking love Marcus smart man
Maybe Marcus Smart?
Marcus Smart without the passing ability
"I humbly submit [Marcus Smart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a4CnOtVn0U) for consideration, although DORT is the hotness right now (deservedly so)."

"What about like CJ McCollom+ to Boston, Marcus Smart+ to Portland, and Kemba Walker to I dunno somehwere else and also someone else does the work of figuring out the salaries and what the +es are."
"Marcus ""full-court hustle play"" Smart."
"lol, am I the only one that was like, ""Come on, that's not that insane, and also that's not even Marcus smart ... oh, wait. Oh, okay. Nevermind."""
Marcus Smart is a star in my eyes.
"Here's the Marcus Smart formula:   - Limit iso shooting  - Focus on ball movement/penetration on offense  - Expend 90% of energy on defense  - Piss him off, just a little bit (Boston media had been saying his defense has fallen off)  He's a maniac, so not all 4 of those things consistently happen at once, but when they do, he's really one of the best role players in the league. Nobody does shit like this in the NBA."

Fuck Marcus Smart bitch ass
oh yaaaaa the perfect celtics &amp; perfect marcus smart who hasn’t messed up multiple games lately
the marcus smart roller coaster has a lot more lows than highs.
you live by the marcus smart and die by the marcus smart.
"Stanley Johnson for Marcus Smart seems fair for both sides, right??? Right???"
"PG: Chris Paul 16 PPG  SG: Marcus Smart 13.4 PPG  SF: Mikal Bridges 13.2 PPG  PF: Draymond Green 6.6 PPG  C: Nikola Jokic 26.2 PPG  Fantastic ball movement, elite defense, and overall solid enough shooting to make up for Draymond's complete lack of it."
This is why I am Marcus Smart

You mean Marcus Smart?
God the Celtics needs Marcus Smart back fucking stat
"He’s not known as a good shooter and his shot selection is usually terrible, but for some reason Marcus Smart has hit a ton of key shots for the Celtics. I trust him more with the ball down 2 than up 10."
You're so full of it dude. I'll tell you 1. The Celtics-- but they would still have to give up Marcus Smart.  Who else?
"Lot here firstly on Justise Winslow I think there a few issues   1) There was a time I was also once really high on Winslow but I think that ship has set sail. Injuries are a big issue. But beyond that his skill set really is much more a 6th man/3rd wing off the bench type. Needs the ball in his hands to really have an impact. Nobody guards him on the perimeter. And for a wing he's actually quite bad finishing at the rim. Also his playmaking is good for a wing but relative to guards its nothing crazy I dont think he's a better playmaker than Marcus Smart who youre right you dont want him being the best playmaker on your team.   2)   &gt;Barnes is your Jeff Green-type small-ball 5.   Honestly I think Jaylen Brown is probably bulkier and better at guarding bigger guys. He's closer to a small ball 5 to me. But Brad has never really shown much desire even last year when his 5 best players were Jaylen/Hayward/Tatum/Kemba/Smart to go small like that. Just not who he really is. As a changeup to close games late you can do it once in a while but I think Brad tends to like having a C and traditional rim protector for how he structures his defense.   3)   &gt;Tatum is honestly this odd blend of Harden/KD where he's not as good as either of them at their strengths.  I've comp'd Tatum to pre injury Grant Hill in the past, not sure I see Harden beyond the step back 3s element can see Durant some. I agree his playmaking isnt there to be a no 1 guy yet but there's also consistent gradual improvement with it. Beyond that though in terms of potential improvement, [Ive monitored this for years with him](http://nbashotcharts.com/zoned?id=-5546440) there's a big gap in his %s on shots outside the paint from the left vs right side of the court. Like 45% vs 36% for his career I havent seen a split like it over a large sample size before. And I dont have a good explanation for it. But alot of those difficult jumpers he takes, it really just comes down to whether he's on the left vs right side of the court in terms of whether they are good shots. And Im surprised tbh I havent really seen teams in the playoffs gameplan around this directional tendency.   4)  &gt;I'm treating Kemba as if he's closer to the player he is now as opposed to the player he used to be, and if that's really the case like I think it is, the Celtics are fucked.  Yeah....so this is tough. The gravity he provides coming off pick and rolls is really important to this offense its part of why for this team to reach its ceiling he needs to be out there and Im not necessarily in favor of trying to build lineups without him for key stretches in the playoffs he's too important/unique. But that said I agree with you physically he's not gonna get better with age. Was talking about this with a celtics fan I know last week ultimately we both kind of concluded if your Boston you kind of just have to hope you get lucky and Kemba turns it around and becomes 80% of what he was last yr. Are the odds of it happening great no but I think it's the only way they end up having a high enough ceiling to really contend at the top level potentially. I just think you are capping your ceiling too much putting in someone like Justise Winslow instead of him.   &gt;a guard who is great on offense but bad on defense is worth it, like can you win at the highest level with Kemba Walker as your point guard defensively?   Depends on specifics if its an Isaiah Thomas level defender this becomes an issue. But for someone like Kemba who I think is just a generic poor defender not some absolute disaster yes I do think you can win with that. I think  GSW wouldve been fine if Steph was a worse defender. San Antonio won with Tony Parker. The Celtics defensive rating when Kemba was on the court vs Toronto was 100. Vs Miami it was 112-113 is that great no but the Lakers beat Denver in 5 games with a 113 defensive rating in today's NBA its not a death sentence.   One thing Ive noticed over the years is that teams can excessively hunt a weaker guard to their own detriment. You get out of your own offense too much and there's an elements of fools gold with it you stagnate your offense too much worrying too much about trying to go at that one defender. It's part of why to me the most detrimental guard defenders to have aren't necessarily the small ones who can be overpowered 1 v1 its the ones who are horrible with help defense, give no effort and are lost off ball. Those are the ones who hurt you the most to me, it's why Im not surprised guys like Bradley Beal end up at the bottom of defensive metrics every year.   &gt;John Collins would be nice, but I don't see him getting moved. Thad Young  Yeah I was gonna bring up Thad also that's a good one he can let you downsize the way you were referring to earlier also. I actually do think JC does get moved before the summer it's just how much do you give up. Atl probably really pushes for Marcus Smart I tend to lean against doing that if Boston ultimately"
"Sure, but salary is a key determination if rostering someone is smart or not. Marcus is a better player, but I wouldn’t be thrilled to have him taking up $20m in cap space."
How is Tatum a SF when he starts next to Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart?
Marcus Smart has been the heart of our team for 7 years and he's still here
"Tbf those expectations are higher because a couple years ago you had those two young star wings and Marcus Smart *and* three all-star level guys in Kyrie, Hayward, &amp; Horford. Plus a bunch of draft assets IIRC. That squad looked like a dynasty in the making.   It's not all Ainge's fault, obviously, but it's fair to say that from that position things have gotten worse."
"We have all our own assets still. Plus one of the youngest teams in the league with two emerging all-star wings and one of the best defensive guards in the league.   It's just a case of Boston being held to a different standard than most teams.   * Boston makes 3 conference finals out of 4 = Failure in a league where most teams haven't been able to make 1 in decades.  * Boston has 2 all-stars under 25 = Failure in a league where no other team can say the same  * Boston has the 5th youngest team in the league = Failure in a league where all 10/12 of the youngest teams in the league have losing records (Denver being the other exception)  * Boston has all their own picks = Failure in a league where most contenders have already traded theirs away   We're actually really well-positioned for the future. That's before mentioning the TPE, Marcus Smart or Kemba Walker."
&gt; he's our 'Marcus Smart' sized mid-tier contract that everyone will throw into trades   That puts it into good context for a Boston fan. So many Boston trade ideas would just throw Marcus Smart in to match salary as if he's not also an important player to the team.
"Norm's good when he starts. His defense is suspect and he's historically been inconsistent, but after a slow start this year he's mostly back to the highs he reached in the latter half of last year.  Dude's an athletic, vertical threat who shoots 40% from 3. Standard night is like, 18-1-1. We'll probably extend him after this year, but he's our 'Marcus Smart' sized mid-tier contract that everyone will throw into trades."
"Haven't had any continuity. Kemba missed the first half of the season, during that stretch Tatum missed several games due to COVID protocol. Tristan Thompson and Jeff Teague, their 2 main FA signings haven't panned out at all. Marcus Smart got hurt when Kemba came back. Add in Pritchard's injury (a guy that actually has contributed really well off the bench) in there too."
"Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Payton Pritchard, Romeo Langford, Robert Williams, Grant Williams, Semi Ojeleye, and Avery Bradley aren’t NBA players I guess"
Marcus Smart would be 1 all time.    Advance flopping metrics.    OFR (offensive flop rate) DFR (defense)
"Yea, but there's 0 reason to bring up the C's. We have literally no way of getting him outside of throwing Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, or Kemba Walker at them"
"Tatum and J. Brown are doing great, the issue is there is too much talent on the team to share the ball. If you take away 1 from the team then the other would be at 30 ppg easily. Tatum is A1, and Brown is A2, but brown wants to be the #1 option, and so does marcus smart sometimes, but then you have kemba walker on the team as well. Tatum or Brown can be the #1 option on their own teams, but working together and sharing the rock is difficult. Gordon Hayward was averaging like 17 ppg and coming off the bench on the celtics but now going off with the Hornets.  Siakim is someone who is a true #2 or #3 option. He needs a true superstar in front of him on the team."
Justin Anderson was going to our Marcus Smart
The marcus smart special
Celtics would have to trade Marcus Smart and Smart is better than Vucevic sooooo don't see why they would do that
"Yeah I don’t get people who are quickly now dismissing torn Achilles rigjt now, Marcus smart looked like he tore his basically a mirror image of KDs injury but turned at to be a strain. We won’t know for sure till tomorrow"
People sleep on Marcus Smart dude was a offensive powerhouse in college who realized he needed to play D to stay in the league. Id take Smart just do the 6'5 frame and offensive and defensive skill set.
"It's not just that Marcus Smart plays great defense, he's also a very good passer and is athletic enough to get boards. 5 Marcus Smarts could actually run an offense."
Have we seen prime Marcus Smart yet?
Gimme Marcus Smart!
Marcus smart easily IMO.
"fuck this, going modern day  Marcus Smart Jrue, I guess. Either him or Pat Bevy Ben Simmons or RoCo Dray (underrated as all hell) Gobert or Bam"
The Celtics started the season 8-3 then the star player got COVID and is still clearly unhealthy. After that Marcus Smart got injured and proved that he is extremely important to this team because without him we clearly lack energy on the court. I think that when they get back to normal we will be a great team again but that is coming from a homer. I think it’s a little too early to call.
"Watching the Celtics slowly swallow this pill (not u marcus smart) and accepting that baiting fouls is what it takes to win in this league. Teague has been around the block and it shows because hes the only one with the ability to get to the stripe consistently. It pains me to see Tatum going for fouls instead of finishing at the rim cause quite frankly, it works better."
"Reminder that the Celtics once had Kyrie, Hayward, Rozier, Tatum, Brown, Horford, Smart, and Marcus Morris on one squad. Obviously all in different stages of their development, but still...wtf."
"Irving Hayward in their primes who were aces of their previous teams. All star veteran Horford. Rising superstar Tatum. Rising star Brown. All-Defensive team Smart. Young yet elite coach. Marcus Morris, Rozier, Kelly Olynyk, Crowder, Baynes, and future picks from other (at that time) lottery teams.   We all thought they would be the successor of Warriors. What happened?!"
"Teams like the Nuggets and Mavs with playoff hopes but shitty defense would be willing to give some picks and young players for Smart. I could easily see a MPJ for Marcus Smart swap.  If we wanted to get crazy, I think Smart + tons of picks could land the Celtics Christian Wood (ik Rockets fans will crucify me, but you’d rather have 4 first rounders, trust me). I also think that picks + exception could get them a guy even as good as Kyle Lowry (not this exact player but a guy of that caliber and circumstance).  They could also benefit from a Steven Adams/Clint Capela, but I don’t know how realistic those options are.  Honestly, as long as the Celtics have two All-NBA level wings they will be competitive, but I doubt they could beat a defensive team like the Bucks or Sixers."
"okay Dwade was attacking the rim and going at people all the time, plus he didn’t really become Wade until like 05 when the last of the defensive rules were changed to curtail hand-checking, clarify blocking fouls and call defensive three seconds to open up the game (https://cdn.nba.net/nba-drupal-prod/nba-rules-changes-history.pdf)  Chris Paul is the same as D Wade.   I have multiple comments explaining how Manu Ginobilli’s flopping is one of the worst thing to happen to basketball and it’s why the Spurs were so hated in the early 2000s.   Reggie Miller was also pretty well-hated and i didn’t like reggie as a player then and i don’t like him now.   Laimbeer is one of the dirtiest players to ever play, what a great example    the fact of the matter is that in the era of the 80s to 2005, it was all about getting into the paint and attacking the rim. yes you had mid range jumpshots, but that’s when the drive or the post game didnt work. and they didn’t flop nearly as blatantly. they bitched about calls, but Marcus Smart is embarrassing the way he flops for how good of a player he is. same with LeBron. 100 times out 100 give me guys who drive into the lane and then try to beat some ass like Kermit Washington. watching Jimmy Butler roll around in pain laughing and tickling other players on the court feels like something out of Baseketball    watching guys shoot 36% from 3 isn’t fun.  they miss 60% of the time and i can get that at my local high school. NBA superstar Trae Young makes 42% of his shots. who in gods name wants to watch that? it’s just a free throw contest.   and missed jump shots are uber less exciting. what is more fun to watch: 6’6 220 pogo stick Desmond Mason miss a layup against 6’10 Chris Wilcox or Coby White and Jordan Clarkson trading pull-up 3 clanks?"
Marcus smart
"They lost Hayward for nothing, Kemba hasn't looked right in a year and Marcus Smart is out injured. That's not good for a Boston team that even at full strength has maybe only 6-7 real rotation players. People keep saying that they should have traded Hayward for Turner and McDermott, but hell, how much better would they be if they'd just traded him to Charlotte for Batum?"
Hot take. Marcus Smart is really important
"Really think it’s weird how Lowry checks Tatum when we play. Like Lowry is great don’t get me wrong, but I think OG guarded Marcus Smart in our series together? Wtf is that Nick"
"&gt;There’s a lot of similarities between last year’s sixers and this years celtics  That's legit how I've been feeling this year, unfortunately. Granted, I think we'll be a different team once everyone is healthy, especially Marcus Smart."
Marcus Smart for Taj straight up get it done Ainge/Rose
"Eddie Jones  His length, athleticism, and defensive smarts would all be very impactful today. He was a solid jump shooter but didn’t create super well; he would get better looks playing off-ball in a modern offense.  He’d be like a taller longer Marcus Smart."
"Thanks. You're right, great video.   Also, while I'll probably get downvoted by Celtics fans for it, how fitting that Marcus Smart is featured pretty heavily in this. I always struggle with whether being a Heat fan causes me to be overly critical of him and Kemba for their flopping. Good to see my thoughts validated."
"Marcus Smart? Definitely Vince Carter, it’s how he stayed in the league so long, he reinvented himself from a slash and drive player to a spot up shooter."
GG Marcus Smart.
Marcus Smart would be out of a job
"Marcus smart was underrated for a long time, despite being in a big market."
If they were really serious about this rule Marcus Smart would be fined his yearly salary by now  There consistency with this is ass
Celtics fans have to mention Marcus Smart in any thread. Its weird.
Marcus Smart would get eating alive by the golden era bigs
"Even though he's one notch below, Marcus Smart"
"&gt;""AY CALL THE FUCKING FOUL REF!""  Lol Marcus Smart is such a bonehead.  Flops looking for a foul, and then is too caught up with complaining to the ref to even care that his teammate just scored a game-winning layup.   Such an unlikable dude."
"2014 in hindsight turned to be such a dud class, the ONLY lottery pick that turned into an All-Star 6 years on was Joel Embiid (who missed his first 2 seasons). The other All-Star in that class was some fat Serbian kid taken in the 2nd round.  The best player not named Embiid taken in the lottery is either one of Marcus Smart, Zach Lavine, TJ Warren or Julius Randle.   The rest have been varying degrees of underwhelming (Wiggins, Gordon, Payton, McDermott), ruined by injuries (Parker, Exum) or straight-up out of the league (Stauskas, Vonleh)"
LOL at Marcus Smart at the end. Refs do suck tho
Marcus smart ‽ ‽ ‽
Trae young omg playing against the hawks this man wants to be Marcus smart jr in terms of flopping
Was that Marcus Smart airball 3 a few plays earlier the 2nd dumbest play you've seen this year?
Russ is like a superstar Marcus Smart. He’ll play you into a tie game that you thought was lost and then play you out of the win jacking up terrible shots and you don’t know whether to be happy he got you there or mad he blew it
Yo Marcus Smart you're Marcus Smart and shouldn't be shooting the final shot.
Marcus Smart is such a piece of shit man. Arguing about calling a foul instead of being happy his teammate got the putback and win. Gg Celts
marcus”CALL THE FUCKIN FOUL MAN” smart
You really gonna say that when y'all have one of the worst floppers in Marcus Smart? Every team has embraced flopping and foul baiting. Some teams are just better at it/have more guys who do it.
Difference in free throws doesn’t automatically translate to biased reffing. 75% of jimmys offense is drawing fouls. Also marcus smart fouling a crosscourt heave will do that
"For the love of every deity there is, can the celtics stop letting marcus smart run the offense in clutch? 4 possessions he ran the offense and the game was nearly stolen. Look at that 11-0 run by tatum, he ran the offense with JB and they manage to pull the lead."
"he def did, bam probably got him too, but that's marcus smart, he's not getting that call lol"
Why the fuck is Marcus Smart driving to win the game?
Marcus smart is so ass lmao
Marcus smart has 0 IQ
"Marcus Smart and hero ball, name a more iconic duo"
Tatum has 2 game winners already and just generally cant miss a jump shot so naturally its Marcus smart time
I would go to war with Marcus smart. Dude is a baller
OMG Marcus Smart made some bad decisions and reduced a huge lead.  Let’s let that outweigh the dozens of games he’s won single handedly.    Like this one:  https://youtu.be/1a4CnOtVn0U
Marcus Smart might be the worst player in the NBA. I get once every 30 games he goes 5/8 from 3 but holy fuck am I glad hes not on my team
"Marcus Smart is literally playing for the Heat. You're up 17 you dumb fuck, stop sprinting down the court and taking fouls. Only good thing you offer is showing how dumb Boston fans are for loving this guy"
Well youre a rational fan then. Unfortunately most of your fanbase isnt from the comments ive been reading lately about him but It is what it is I guess. Defensive communication seems to be the wizards biggest problem and even having a guy like AD or Marcus Smart wouldnt change this team. It has to be on coaches and players consistently figuring out what the problem is. Not sure if you guys will get rid of brooks but its not looking pretty. Also I know you guys have a lot of points but the spacing is pretty bad. I dont even blame russ for not driving much lol.
Marcus Smart is in the bathroom.
Yeah I was just playing around.   There is no conceivable world where we trade Kyle Lowry for Marcus Smart though
"2014 is one of the weirdest drafts Ive seen yes it got wildly hyped and tbh the top 10 is one of the worst we've had looking back in many years. You can make a legitimate case the non lottery picks from that year are a better collection of players than the lottery   lottery: Embiid, Aaron Gordon, Wiggins, Jabari, Saric, Zach LaVine, Marcus Smart, Julius Randle, Exum, McDermott   non lottery: Nurkic, TJ Warren, Jokic, Jerami Grant, Spencer Dinwiddie, Gary Harris, Clint Capela, Kyle Anderson, Rodney Hood, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Joe Harris, Dwight Powell, Jordan Clarkson"
Marcus Smart got fined for flopping in the playoffs last year.
"How 'bout Oubre for Marcus Smart, straight up?"
Who’s the closest to budget KD and Dray in order to form a budget warriors dynasty in Portland?   Ingram and Marcus Smart perhaps although he’s a bit shorter
"Done more with less? Stevens had a team consisting of Jared Sullinger, Evan Turner, Gerald Wallace, IT, Tyler Zellar &amp; Marcus smart making the playoffs his second year in Boston."
"Obviously, it takes a team to win games, but it certainly helps when guys like Tatum and Brown go nuclear. You can definitely win games like that, it's not sustainable for a season, but you guys can definitely keep your heads above water by just outscoring teams if Tatum and Brown keep playing the way they are while Smart is out. You guys are 5-3, I think once Marcus comes back you guys will eventually start finding your defensive mojo."
"Man, that would totally give opportunities to a lot of young players.   1 and 2. The Jays   3. Marcus Smart   4. Peyton Pritchard    5. Kemba Walker   6. Grant Williams   7. Robert Williams"
i am still flabbergasted by the contract he signed in the bubble  i feel so bad for him he deserves at least marcus smart money (which is also a bargain)
Celtics  1. Jayson Tatum 2. Jaylen Brown 3. Marcus Smart 4. Peyton Pritchard 5. Robert Williams 6. Aaron Nesmith 7. Romeo Langford
Jaylen Brown  Jayson Tatum  Marcus Smart  Tristan Thompson  Grant Williams  Peyton Pritchard  Kemba Walker
"Considering Ben Simmons, Jrue Holiday, Marcus Smart, Lu Dort are all out there, I don't see how Schroder can squeeze in."
"I think Jrue is still underrated to casual viewers. Most people don't know his name as well as Pat Bev or Marcus Smart when talking about defensive guards, for example."
"On Ball: Marcus Smart, Jrue, Ben Simmons, OG, Dort  Help:  Giannis, Gobert, Isaac (How did people forget him), AD, Embiid"
"I feel like you could bring Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Marcus Morris, and Aron Baynes off the bench and they still wouldn’t win."
Marcus Smart if he just jacked 3's
"Perimeter - jrue, marcus smart, ben simmons, og, kris dunn  Help - giannis, Gobert, Johnathan isaac"
"The ""feisty bulldog mentality"" guys that don't mind being hated by opposing fanbases. The Marcus Smart, Grant Williams type."
"Originally you were clowning Draymond for not scoring a lot, but you're defending Rodman even though he averaged less points than Draymond. Draymond plays elite defense and facilitates the basketball on offense. Draymond impacts our team positively in spite of him not scoring a lot through his bball IQ on defense and offense. I don't get the contradiction in your logic isn't apparent to you. This is like clowning Marcus Smart for not scoring a lot even though he's a positive asset."
"How many championships have the Celtics won with ""WINNING PLAYS"" Marcus Smart?"
"Along with the Marcus Smart head shake, one of the most unintentionally hilarious things I’ve seen"
Tbh even the  Jaylen Brown/ Siakam debate is over. At this point we’re gonna soon have the Marcus smart/Siakam debate lmao
"&gt; I can't believe you've done this  ~ marcus smart, probably"
"Man I know Boston is in full hospital mode but it only makes Payton shine so much brighter as a rookie in the league, my man has been displaying endless hustle every night to keep us in games at the guard position when Walker (and our god Marcus Smart tonight) are out and such weak/inconsistent fills to the role. Hope Toronto can figure it out thru the season but off a b2b and with so many Cs out I'm loving the progression of this game"
"Jaylon Brown, Marcus Smart, Jason Tatum, Daniel Theis, and Tristan Thompson"
"Yup, since we played each other in the bubble really. Maybe it was the surreal-ness of the bubble atmosphere and everything that had gone on during the year, I was almost philosophically like “why should I hate these guys, man?” Lol, I like Tatum’s growth, seems like a good guy, I like Brown’s development and was happy to see Kemba in the playoffs. Even Marcus Smart I appreciated as basically your team’s Lowry so I know the role he plays, as well as that Sleepy Williams guy having my current favourite NBA nickname “Timelord” lol."
No. Marcus Smart didn’t do that for us in the playoffs so no can do buddy.
"I mean, this is ridiculous since it'd never happen regardless, but the idea that adding a top 15 player in the league would be bad somehow is asinine.   While we're here, Beal would be the 3rd guy on the Celtics that deserves 10-15 shots with Jayson &amp; Jaylen.  They're really lacking offense elsewhere on the roster, currently their 3rd best healthy offensive player is Marcus Smart, which, woof."
"Sorry I mean marcus smart 😅  But yea, I'll take Dwight and Morris, they've actually played in a conference finals before. Not sure if Gobert has even made a semifinals yet. Maybe one day 🤷🏾‍♂️"
"Uh, fantasy, it’s not convenient but it’s usually the most updated way. Just check the “DNPs”. Better than not knowing atleast. The big sites only report on big stars but forget to mention “Marcus smart is not playing today” or “Dejounte Murray is out today”"
"kyrie is probably the best. lowry and cp3 are good down there too. marcus smart is pretty good but i don't know how he would stack up against some of the other guards, definitely not on kyrie or cp3/lowry's level."
"The package would be centered around Kemba not Marcus. Doesnt make sense to have beal and kemba in the same back-court and to lose smart, we would give up 160 a game."
If we're having a debate about the **smartest** plays that develop as a result of good screeners:   PG: Jamal Murray - The man gets hit with Centers when he and Jokic reverse roles and he screens for Jokic    SG: Marcus Smart - The broad shoulders and the low core work well in his favour   SF: Lebron James - Is there a thing that this man cannot do?   PF: Draymond Green - Super smart about where and when he should screen   C: Nikola Jokic - The man is an screen island bombarding cutters with passes  If we're having a debate about **hardest** screeners:   PG: Lowry and his Kardashian sized ass   SG: Lu Dort   SF: Jae Crowder   PF: Richaun Holmes   C: Steven Adams
Marcus Smart
Jayson and Jaylen (and Marcus Smart to a lesser extent) are absolutely carrying the rest of this roster on their backs. We've got guys who shouldn't be getting NBA minutes in our rotation.
Marcus Smart is really good too
"For 20 seconds I was barely breathing, scared that Marcus Smart might randomly pull up."
You tripping Marcus Smart is the man.
Marcus Smart and Pat Bev
Each team gets an allowance of flops per game (or FPGs for you analytics nerds) and we have Marcus Smart.
Marcus Smart 3 point shot 8 seconds into the play incoming
"can't post up Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, Kemba, and now Lonzo Ball  has he tried spinning?"
"My team would probably top 2-4 seed. (all these guys in their primes)  IT4(Celtics Isaiah)  Marcus Smart  Bird  KG  Horford.  On offense, you have 2 go-to guys, in IT and Larry Bird. Both are great playmakers and 3-level scorers. Marcus Smart is a solid catch-and-shoot guy, and both KG and big Al can stretch the floor to a degree.  On defense, Marcus Smart would help hide IT, we would have incredible post defense with KG and Al, Marcus is an all-nba defender, and Larry Bird is solid.  Only problem is KG and Marcus might not get along, but Horford can be a leader and glue guy for this team.  I would love watching this team play  EDIT: If I can have a 6th man it's gotta be Eddie House."
i have enough watching 1 marcus smart with his shot selection.  4 of them are going to be a fucking disaster.
"This is the only realistic 2 team trade that I’d be okay with considering the circumstances. Less realistic but Harden and PJ for Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, and 1 or 2 picks I’d be content with. Totally unrealistic Harden + PJ  for Murray and MPJ, but If I’m Denver I’d rather give up a haul of picks and keep one of the two."
"Marcus Smart, Paul Pierce, Abdel Nader, OG Anunoby, Anthony Bennett?"
All my homies hate Marcus Smart
"Imagine Rockets trade Harden for Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart and picks."

I’m not worried about his shot but it’s not that clear.  The pacers starters are all very good.  Hawks have bogdan or capela though capela hasn’t looked like hou capela so far.  Brook lopez and Marcus smart are very impactful defenders
"Gallinari or Bogdan, Conley or Bojan, some guy from the Nets, some guy from the Pacers, Marcus Smart. Those are my answers."

Trade him for Marcus Smart
Kelly Oubre is like one or two tiers under the Marcus Smart tier of flopper lol
Marcus Smart?
Marcus Smart was livid. He was screaming “That whiskey is mine mother fuckers!” into the microphone.  He continued to yell obscenities as an instrumental of Taylor Swift’s “Shake it Off” played in the background.
Marcus Smart failed to mention the entire team drank his whiskey and then some.
"Marcus, I know you got balls of steel but you gotta  be you know ""Smart"" about a pivotal possession."
"Marcus is making [12 million/year](https://hoopshype.com/player/marcus-smart/salary/) so that's .000083 of his salary.  If you made 100k a year that is getting mad at someone taking an $8 bottle from you for a karaoke machine. The average person makes 56,516 per year according to Google so that is getting mad at someone stealing a 4 dollar gift.  Frankly there isn't a great argument for getting mad. Just buy a bottle yourself. Or buy a case and have plenty."
"? That’s not true.  In the last 5 minutes of our 5 close games, Marcus Smart only made 1 shot (and it was off a catch and shoot from a Kemba pass in game 6).  [Take a look youself](https://go.nba.com/5fzd)  I feel like you just wanted to get the “Celtics beat the Raptors” jab in so I’ll allow it"
Must still but upset as marcus smart helped send you to the couch last year
"funny, that's how we beat you guys last year  if you can't handle Marcus at his dumb you don't deserve him at his smart"
You let Marcus Smart call his own number in a must score scenario
"If you can't handle Marcus at his Dumb, you don't deserve Marcus at his Smart."
I wish I had the confidence Marcus smart has   Game 7 of the NBA Finals and he'll take the last shot lol
"Hey idiot Celtic fans...this is what happens when you don’t have your best players play hero ball in the last two minutes. You have Grant Williams taking three shots, of course missing them all, and Marcus Smart taking awful shot/s and missing them. Stop complaining about Tatum taking “bad shots” at end of games when he easily has the skill to make it. The other guys don’t."
Marcus Smart is such an idiot. Give the ball to one of the Jays dummy
"just in case you needed a reminder of marcus smart, marcus smart everybody"
Marcus Smart swears he’s Curry Lmaoo
"Why did Smart shoot? WHY U NO SMART, MARCUS SMART?"
"Given that it was Marcus Smart, he probably flopped and the bottle rolled away"
"Ok. But Marcus Smart can just buy his own 12 year whisky. This isn't news, 12 years isn't even all that long for whisky."
Marcus Smart is in Shambles driving around downtown Boston looking for his 12-Years aged Whiskey.
Marcus Smart was backpedaling into that screen and it still didn't get called lol
I never wanna hear Sixers fans complaining about Marcus Smart ever again. Look at your own player.
Marcus Smart is the most frustrating guy to root against. The guy basically only makes the most difficult shots
Why is Marcus Smart our first option on offense?
Legit he should just jump into defenders like Marcus smart! He’d actually average like 6 more points per game
Marcus Smart     hes so good
"I hate when Marcus Smart takes fadeaways like that and makes. It reinforces some urge in his brain to keep doing it and will miss the next 10 that he takes. He should not be our first option on offense, no matter who else is on the court."
if I was guarding Marcus smart and he made that shot and then talked shit id be sick
Marcus Smart should just play defense
Marcus Smart with a vintage first quarter performance!
Have a feeling this is gonna be a Marcus Smart game tonight
"They have 4 intriguing young players + White and Poeltl who look like solid role players.   Dejounte Murray - Primary Ball Handler, Point of Attack  Lonnie Walker - Secondary Ball Handler, Helper  Devin Vassell - Stationary Shooter, Wing Stopper  Keldon Johnson - Athletic Finisher, Helper  Jakob Poeltl - Roll + Cut Big, Anchor Big  Derrick White - Primary Ball Handler, Point of Attack  Murray, Vassell, Johnson, and Poeltl look like surefire starters. The question then becomes between Lonnie Walker or Derrick White as a starter and whether you want to use Walker off the bench as a bucket gettor like Tim Hardaway has been at times or Will Barton is for the Nuggets, or you want to use Derrick White off the bench to run your offense like Marcus Smart does for the Celtics.   Johnson is intriguing from the standpoint that he might be able to play some small-ball 5 in the future with how strong he is ala a PJ Tucker. Poeltl is really good for a center, but drop coverage becomes untenable in the playoffs, and you have to be able to switch 1-5. That's why it's not crazy that in the future they could close with Murray-White-Walker-Vassell-Johnson."
"Actually in the post he definitely is. What he can’t do in strength he makes up for in anticipation and pestering the offense. Great example is Vuc. His post game is so polished and he’s big enough to back down Giannis and score on him, but Giannis poked the ball out very often leading to turnovers and also denied the ball extremely well by jumping all over Vuc and constantly fighting with him for position, the ways Marcus smart would. He’s been playing like a wing/guard in the post rather than a wing very often this year, going for steals instead of holding his ground and blocking the shot, and to some extent it’s the best method of stopping someone like Embiid, Vucevic, Jokic, when you’re smaller than them. His ball denial is awesome for a big  Ofcourse they’re asimilar in many manners, like the screen maneuvering you mentioned, but there are some similarities"
"&gt;It seems he’s amazing on ball and in the post. He’s a pest who plays like Marcus smart in the body of a 7-footer.   Not at all.   He's an amazing off-ball defender but he's nothing like a Marcus Smart on-ball. Nor could he ever really be like Smart, who's whole on-ball defensive identity is about getting in and under his target. Smart defends underneath you, Giannis towers over you.   Plus, while his feet are quick, he's a huge guy and it takes a lot to move a body as big as his. He can beat almost anyone in an open sprint but he's not going to keep up with smaller guards in short bursts (especially laterally and backwards).   Adding to that, being so big makes it hard to fight over screens (another thing Smart is famous for). So he's easier to shake off if you want to force the mismatch."
"Brogdon if he is still even considered one. If not then Marcus smart, draymond, Richardson, Ibaka"
You guys forgot about Marcus smart
I’d say Jaylen Brown is pretty well-liked as well for good reasons.  More so than Tatum for us (though he usually receives pretty positive reactions) given how vanilla Tatum is.  Then we have our beloved Marcus Smart to balance things out.
Yeah Trae Young and Marcus Smart being that high up knowing how they play isn't a surprise and it's also pretty damn pathetic. Looking forward to the league changing up some rules in the near future. People wanna watch basketball. Not free throw contests.
"Give Steph, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Al Horford, Marcus Smart, and Terry Rozier and I guarantee he doesn't flame out in the second round all the while talking about he should've shot more, when he's like 2 for fucking 17. Kyrie hasn't done shit without having a top three player on his team."
Yeah I don’t understand what this post is about.  He said multiple times “them”. There is no single syllable of anything he said that implies Giannis didn’t realize Marcus Smart was on the Celtics.    He probable scrunched his face because he couldn’t understand her as it was two non native English speakers trying to communicate in English.   But that’s why he was looking at the stat sheet before he talked.
[Marcus Smart draws three charges on Giannis in one game](https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kj6kaz/highlight_marcus_smart_taking_three_charges_from/)
Marcus Smart and Marcus Smart
"Well this is wrong. I disagree with OP, either Middleton or Giannis should definitely close, but Jrue is not overrated. The dude is a stud. An absolute stud. One of the best defensive players in the league with far above average offense. Literally Marcus Smart on steroids."
"Yea klove isn’t the most movable guy, and because of that he might stick around even after his contract is up, but I would be very surprised if Drummond sticks around past the deadline. Boston should pick him up in a heartbeat if they don’t have to lose Marcus smart, and teams like Charlotte, Toronto, or Chicago should take a look at him if they want to push into the playoffs"
"He's an elite defender. So is Marcus Smart. You won't find me slobbering all over him as a player because of his defense. You'll just find me angrily tweeting if he gets snubbed for All-Defense team.  I think the idea of who Ben Simmons could have been blinds people to who Ben Simmons actually is. He's a very good player. But he needs a very specific team built around him, because he has some glaring deficiencies, especially for the modern game. He doesn't shoot well enough to be a 1/4, and he doesn't have the post moves to be a 5. At this point he's super Draymond Green. Nothing wrong with that, but that's not the #2 player on a championship team."
"Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart.   Both were talented when they got to the league, but JB had no handle, and Smart had no shot."
"Nets absolutely shouldn’t be, having a guard that can’t play off ball would be a disaster. They don’t need a playmaker, they need a three and d guy, think Marcus Smart, Robert Covington."
NBA honestly throws me off with ages the most of any sport. Even though I know they were in the same draft class I still think Marcus Smart and Julius Randle have 2+ years on Embiid and Jokic
now we wait to see how Marcus Smart will respond
celtics flair lmao. i bet marcus smart is an elite intangible player to you.
"It’s probably the same if the team I like (Bucks) got Marcus Smart: can’t stand the guy at ALL, but if we got him, you’d love his fight. Bobby Portis is like that too. Less annoying than Smart. I’m sure Nets fans have already forgotten about any hate; never existed."
"Marcus Smart. He is a good defender but not first team. Not now, not ever."
Those are Marcus Smart numbers unfortunately
"Giannis and AD are locks. I think Marcus smart will get there. Normally I think ben is a better defender than smart, but Ben's kinda in hot water and if this narrative keeps up I could see someone like Jrue holiday or PG-13 over him. I think Bam or Embiid get it over gobert this year."
"A quick search for the keywords ""Cavs"", ""Love"", ""Sexton"", ""Lue"" from the summer of 2018 yields the following  u/MarcusNotSmart (-107):   &gt; The Cavs legitimately have one of the worst rosters in the league. They won't make the playoffs. There will be no Celtics/Cavs matchup.   [deleted] (+37):   &gt;&gt; Ah yes, Kevin Love is a scrub, Colin Sexton will show no upside and Ty Lue is obviously unable to coach so this roster will have luck being out of the lottery. Not to mention the entire roster is a bunch of scrubs.  &gt;&gt; OR  &gt;&gt; **You can take the reasonable approach and say that this is the first time Lue can actually coach the Cavs without having to deal with LeBron, they still have very good role players, Kevin Love is a bonafide all-star who can now perform as a star player and they have great young talent like Sexton, Nance, Cedi and possible Zizic.**  &gt;&gt; But based on people defending Marcus Smart for sucker punching JR last night I don't expect reasonableness from Celtics fans like yourself at the moment.  https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/9m50o0/cavs_bench_mocking_jayson_tatum_for_getting/e7c4mvv/   I'm sure if I search more I would find more of the same. People absolutely thought the Cavs would be a fringe playoff team before their disastrous 0-6 start."
"I mean, yes &amp; no.  Now with the zone defense rules coverages are more complex and you have to play great team defense to thrive, it's still a big part of the game, just in a different form.  Also, it makes the accomplishments of a Jrue Holiday or Marcus Smart that much more impressive, they're putting the clamps on dudes nightly without actually being able to physically put the clamps on them."
Marcus Smart has worse stats in this game than Paul George when the Clippers lost by 51 points to the Mavericks lol
"You're right good catch. Lebron is 41st in DBPM this year. Still ahead of Kawhi, Pat Bev, and Marcus Smart though."
"He's 1st in the league in [DFG%](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=D_FG_PCT&amp;dir=-1&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100).  His defensive rating is [102](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=1610612747) which is better than Anthony Davis, Giannis, Ben Simmons, Marcus Smart, Patrick Beverley, Kawhi Leonard, Jrue Holiday, Bam Adebayo, and Joel Embid, aka literally every other player except Rudy Gobert listed on Op's all-defense teams.  &gt;He's actually not in the top 20 for DBPM  Wrong he is 17th. https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020_advanced.html"
"Because you outscored them due to unsustainable shooting lmao. Not because you showed literally any ability to stop them.   You had a 115 DRTG last playoffs (120 against the Jazz). Both of those marks would have ranked last in the entire league for the regular season.    It's called Pick and Roll man. The ball handler has a huge advantage in it. That's why it's the most used play in basketball. Unless you have a marcus smart or Jrue holiday tier player, they're likely not going to be able to do shit about it but go over the screen and try to contest from behind  That's why it's so important for bigs to be able to defend the PnR. Jokic can't. Gobert can't (it's why people say he isn't worth his deal). Jokic just makes up for it with offense."
"* Luka had a godlike first half, mediocre 2nd half. I continue to be impressed by his defense this season. He had an interception on the perimeter that looked like something Marcus Smart or CP3 would grab  * KP was playing with his hands tied behind his back on defense. A few very suspect fouls early that were not being called the other way. His mid range has been money, love how he's looked in that regard  * I saw this game as an opportunity for the young guys to prove themselves. Other than Green they largely disappointed. Green too makes a lot of rookie mistakes, he had a couple of bad turnovers. I'm still waiting for Terry to show some flash, but haven't seen it yet. It was a bit classless of Hinton to harass the ballhandler at the end when they were trying to dribble it out"
Kemba and Marcus Smart
Yeah because Marcus Smart has been a multi time all star and has made an All-NBA team
"Soon enough the allure of ""potential"" will rub off Simmons and people will realize that he's close to Marcus Smart quality."
Marcus Smart really wants to be a star
Will Marcus Smart have words for this team after the game
I question the validity of a stat that says Payton Prichard brings almost as much value as Jayson Tatum or that Jeff Teague is better than Marcus Smart or that Shake Milton is the second offensive player on Philly behind Seth Curry and also the second best defender.   There are so many glaring discrepancies in this stat that I doubt there should be much stock put in it.
Marcus Smart
"did they really though? or was that just another narrative pushed by the media? because while everyone knows about the chemistry issues in boston and how kyrie was blamed for it, the following year all the celtic players were quick to defend him. Marcus Smart literally told the media to stop with the bullshit and that it wasn’t on kyrie. Tatum says he and Kyrie are still close. just look at how happy all the Celtic players were to see Kyrie when they played on christmas this year."
Marcus Smart would say otherwise.
"Yes, he's a significantly worse shooter than Marcus Smart, who is a very good shooter now anyway. But the point is that the value of Ben Simmons shooting consistently doesn't come from the points he earns shooting threes, or the efficiency of the shot, it is in making guys have to guard him out there. You can do that even with terrible numbers if you just shoot it with confidence instead of looking like you're going to shit yourself."
Ben simmons is a significantly worse shooter than Marcus smart.  I don't think you guys realize how bad of a sign it is that he won't even attempt them.
"Doesn't matter, he has to shoot so that guys guard him on the perimeter. Marcus Smart used to shoot like 25% on his worst year, but he'd take them without hesitation and the other team would contest or attempt to contest every single one of them."
"Might not be such a terrible decision for Boston. Ultimately they decided to keep a guy that has been to 3 ECFs with them, is looking like a young allstar caliber player and is still years away from reaching his prime. He won't ever be as good as Harden but when you factor in the other things the Cs would have to give up (probably Marcus Smart and a lot of picks) and the fact that I don't think JT and Harden would be the favorites to win it all, it wasn't a no brainer deal for the Cs as you seem to be suggesting."
Tacko Fall and Marcus Smart.   LeBron James and Alex Caruso.   Kawhi Leonard and literally any teammate
Rozier with Marcus Smart flop.
Lauri Markannen is better than Marcus Smart and Fred VanVleet
Hayes is poor man's Marcus Smart
"I don’t think the distinction really matters. Luka wasn’t a great shooter by percentage in Fiba on lower volume and now that he’s consistently chucking 7-9 a game his percentages have gotten downright awful. Having good form when he misses doesn’t excuse the miss.  Tbh he reminds me of Marcus Smart in that way. Smart took so many 3s, and with great form, for years, but he just kept fucking missing.  And then one day they started going in. But before that, he was a bad shooter.  I could see Luka becoming a guy with a green light for a lot more midrange shots. He’s a spectacular shot creator, but not as great (at least right now, the kid is 21) at finishing the shot. So far this season he’s hitting 26% of his 3s. If he cut out his high difficulty 3s and started hitting 40% of midrangers, which i think is more than realistic with his skillset and the way modern defenses focus on taking away the rim and the 3, he’d increase his efficiency, which you can’t say many guys would do by taking more midrange shots lol"
"Marcus smart and Kyle Lowry flop about the same. From there, Kyle Lowry complains about every single call, whereas smart does not"
"Tampering with AD and Giannis are jokes man.  Just like you are dude.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/nba.nbcsports.com/2020/09/02/marcus-smart-fined-5k-for-flopping-in-celtics-raptors-game-2/amp/  By your logic, the Celtics should have an asterisk on all their wins after this."

"Teague? Theis? both proven guys, then you have Grant, who was great defensively year 1, Semi Ojeleye, who has taken a HUGE leap this year with 7 points on 42% from 3, you have Payton Pritchard, who has exceeded expectations massively, you have Robert Williams, averaging 1.5 blocks in 16 minutes as well as being a huge presence as a roller. Then off the end of the bench Javonte Green, a freaky athletic guy. Also when we are fully healthy, Marcus Smart may come off the bench(all-defense 1st team btw)     The nets have who? Tyler Johnson and Jeff Green?Bruce Brown? Chris Chiozza? that is not a good bench lmfao. C's may not have the best bench in the world, but y'all's bench is awful"
"Imagine cheering for a team with Marcus smart on it and calling Lowry something like ""cryle Lowry""."
Not sure if it’s irrational because I hate how they play but Marcus Smart and Kyle Lowry
"hes not too five but he's up there. maybe if you put him at the cross section of defense and passing, he's a top five guy at guard, but he's not top five at either of those skills. i don't see any reason he can't be, say, a better Marcus Smart though. he's always had great feel and he is an awesome passer. he just needs space. honestly griffin butchered their team and set them up to fail this year by having literally no one but JJ and BI who can shoot. I've made the ""lol griffin was going for reverse spacing so everyone has to pack the paint and leave shooters open"" joke but it's pretty sad. this team comp kills both Bledsoe and lonzo as bad shooting drive and kick guys."
"&gt;a low usage player is scoring less than high usage players  shocking development, really.   other players with less than 0.2 points per touch who also rank high on touches per game: Chris Paul, Lonzo Ball, Marcus Smart, LaMelo Ball.   i wonder if there's a pattern emerging here."
"Since when? Bigs/interior guys have dominated the award for the last 5-6 years while Marcus Smart and Ben Simmons types barely get a look in specifically because their impact is so much greater. Before that you had Kawhi, whose impact stats were unbelievable, but eventually they fell off and he stopped being a contender."

"As far as the DNP-CD goes, you have to realize just how crazy deep the Lakers are. THT shows a lot of promise but is still the Lakers' 11th man, though that's more about the Lakers roster than THT. THT is still just a 20 year old who played in the G-League last year and who's still just figuring things out. Nobody should expect much from him this year, but the guy has physical attributes which are incredibly rare, and he plays with skill and poise which are well beyond his years.   I think if you want to just write him off because he received a DNP-CD you're exposing yourself as someone who really hasn't watched him play. He's sharing time in the backcourt with Schroder, KCP, Caruso, and Wes Matthews, so if those guys are all healthy and available and it's a close game, it's not a shock if those guys get all the guard minutes.  THT is very different than Caruso though. Caruso's ceiling is a high level role player, just due to his skillset. Caruso plays very smart, he's a great defender, and basically has a knack for ""making winning plays"". But he doesn't have the skilleset to suddenly become a star player someday (plus he's already 25). Caruso's ceiling is probably Marcus Smart, and I doubt he ever gets there, but that would be him at his absolute apex.  THT, however, has the skills and body that project much higher than Caruso, especially at his age. If someone from the future told me that eventually THT made an All Star game I'd be impressed, but not utterly shocked to hear that. Guys with his skill and poise are pretty rare at his age, and his body type is almost unheard of. I get you wanting to discount him because he's a Laker, but I suggest you give him more of a look before you just write him off the way you have. Otherwise some of these takes of yours could potentially look utterly foolish a year or two from now."
"I'm not downvoting you but yup, it is an important caveat. Your argument would be exactly the same if it were about Marcus Smart or Jrue Holiday.  Betts is in an elite MLB tier that consists of basically him and Trout. Jokic is great but he's not that. You make it sound like you're comparing Betts and Jokic but you're not, you're comparing MLB to NBA."
Marcus Smart turned into Reggie Miller in game 2 against the Raptors
Marcus smart die?
"Exactly what happened. If Im the nuggest, I'd throw mpj for harden and picks in a heart beat. If I'm the sixers, Maxey is getting included. Morey got greedy on that one. if I'm the celtics, Jaylen brown and marcus smart are gone because maybe they'll throw PJ in.  Now all these easy teams have to hope KD and Harden dont get along or someone gets hurt because they have no fucking way of stopping them defensively."
Dude hit 5 threes in the fourth quarter. I don't care if you show me a decade worth of stats that mathematically prove otherwise... Marcus Smart is the greatest three point shooter of his generation.
Yeah I brought up offense because pointing out that he lost is not a good argument when winning has to do with offense and defense.  Don't understand why that block is so famous. Marcus smart did that shit on Jarrett allen
But tbf our depth helped us win last year even in playoffs. Having Bam/Jae/iggy/DJJ to throw at Giannis. I wanna say we beat the celts cuz their bench was total asshole too. Marcus Smart hero ball aside ofc.
"Kawhi screwed the spurs harder than any star has since Vince Carter. Our amazing offers included Tobias harris and picks 12 and 13 from the clippers, Marcus Smart and picks from the Celtics, Covington, Saric, and a pick or two from the sixers, Ingram and one pick from the lakers, etc."
Our first year with Brad Stevens we went 25-57. Got the 6th pick and took Marcus Smart. The year after that was our late-season playoff push and never really looked back.
I think Kemba being out is a wise decision.  Brown should also rest.  As well as Marcus Smart.  No specific reason just a hunch.
"The same Roster turnover always happens.   Look at the Celtics team with Brad Stevens.    Marcus Smart is the only player left that played in those first 2 Playoff Series under Brad Stevens. Jaylen Brown came in during the 3rd Year of the Celtics making the Playoffs and Tatum after that.   Celtics got rid of Isiah Thomas, Avery Bradley, Jae Crowder, Kelly Olynik, Etc.   Even later on they lost Kyrie, Rozier, Morris, and Horford."
"It really is astounding to me that you think you’re some three dimensional chess god while Danny Ainge has no idea what he’s doing. If you were the Celtics GM, you would’ve traded Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, and multiple firsts for Blake Griffin or Jimmy Butler years ago and the team would currently be at the bottom of the league with no draft capital. It’s hard to get to the finals. It really is. Not only has Ainge shown he can consistently get to the conference finals, he’s shown he can do it with purely homegrown talent. That’s no small feat. He’s got a huge trade exception to work with this off-season and the future looks bright. Ainge is 20 times the GM the Lakers have ever had and isn’t going anywhere anytime soon"
"1) Tatum's defense is elite, all the advanced stats love him. Go-go-gadget arms that manage to be in every passing lane and incredibly switchable. He will win several all-defense awards over the course of his career.  2) Tatum doesn't need to anchor a defense, either, when Marcus Smart is on his team  3) If you're looking for ""where he can improve"" go check his assist numbers last season pre-bubble and then in-bubble. He's shown flashes of becoming the distributor that you need a lead ball-handler to be."
"He was a dawg in SL. Super physical and strong defender, he was a man amongst boys. Anfernee Simoms was killing everyone but has troubled whenever he played him. Bowen was like the Marcus Smart of SL lol"
"I sure wouldn't, we already have one guard taking shots he shouldn't with Marcus Smart"
The Rockets team with Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart would actually be pretty competitive.
"not to mention these are just tons of assets HOU can flip if they feel they are fringe competitors in 2-3 years. Sort of like how every single trade/offseason people mentioned Celtics/Danny Ainge as a possibility.  They could theoretically move Wall/Boogie/Tucker for more assets and then play with tons of assets/cap space and build a good team around Wood who is only 25 (if he maintains his current success).       2021 is a bad FA class, but in 2022 it opens back up with Kawhii (UFA), Beal (PO), Curry (UFA), Zach Lavine (UFA), Julius Randle (UFA), Marcus Smart, JV  Technically Trae/Luka/Sexton/SGA/Jaren Jackson, etc all become RFA       Could build a respectable team in 2 years and then have 45 first round picks to trade for a superstar"
"He's untouchable alongside Marcus Smart, not alone. You don't trade arguably the best guard defender in the league for Harden who will take shots away from Embiid, Simmons and Tobias."
"&gt; It would've had to start with Marcus Smart, and most likely Payton Pritchard who are both untouchable.  Okay so it probably would have had to start with Brown and to suggesat both Smart and Payton Prichard (what the fuck?) are untouchable is laughable."
"It would've had to start with Marcus Smart, and most likely Payton Pritchard who are both untouchable. Smart move by Ainge"
"Utah's pretty good anytime they're picking outside the top 10. Stockton, Malone, Mark Eaton, Gobert, Mitchell, Millsap, Rodney Hood, Alec Burks, CJ Miles, Mo Williams and the GOAT Andrei Kirilenko are all late first or second rounders.  But inside the top 10 they have a hard time. Dominique Wilkins was the third pick but didn't want to be in Utah. Thurl Bailey was good at seven. Deron Williams was really good but they could have had CP3. Hayward was a good pick at 9 but they could have had PG13. Kanter was picked ahead of like 3 or 4 potential HOF players, and Exum was a gamble that made some sense but in retrospect was a waste of an opportunity when Marcus Smart and Julius Randle were the next two picks, and Jordan Clarkson - who the Jazz traded Exum for last season - was picked in the second round."
"&gt;He might not, but if he does a 1 year deal and balls the fuck out, he could get something like 3 years/60 mil.   To get that it would mean somebody next summer will be willing to use $20 million in cap space to offer him that, and I don't see that happening. The teams with cap space are going to target much better players than him and he will again be left hoping that when the music stops he still has a chair. Also, it will be very hard for him to demonstrate this kind of value on the Celtics as Marcus Smart is also going to be looking to showcase his talents for free agency next summer, and the Celtics seem pretty personally invested in Payton Pritchard's future with the team.   I can see why the Celtics would love to get a player of Schroder's caliber on a cheap one year deal, but I don't think there's any chance Schroder would get the chance to play well enough there to earn a $20 million per year deal next summer."
"I was fully bought in, until you said Marcus Smart was fun to watch as a non-Celtics fan lol"
If he's willing to sign a 1 year MLE then he might prefer a team that can offer him a bigger role than he'd get splitting PG minutes with Marcus Smart and Payton Pritchard. I wonder if the Pelicans might offer him a starting spot for the year.
"LaMelo is a good pick. I'm an old head so I also tune in to see Carmelo Anthony do some jabstep hesi midrange jumpers from the bench. Idk it's just cool to watch I'll never get tired of Carmelo having a hot streak.  Another one would be Marcus Smart, he's fun to watch with some sequences of brilliance in-between. MPJ is fun chaos as well."
Marcus Smart
Simmons should go to the Marcus Smart school of shooting.
surprised nobody said Marcus smart for Celtics
So another Marcus Smart? I’ll take that.
Eh. He's kinda like Marcus Smart without any hint of a 3 point shot.
"Ultimately, as a result of trading Pierce, Garnett, Jason Terry, and DJ White, the Celtics have gotten:  * Marcus Smart 6th overall in the 2014 draft (this was the Celtics' own pick, but it is unlikely they would've been drafting 6th if they kept their core)  * Jaylen Brown (pick from Nets)  * Jayson Tatum (pick from Nets, traded to 76ers for 3rd overall pick and 2019 15th overall pick)  *  2018 8th overall pick Colin Sexton (traded to Cavaliers for Kyrie Irving)  * Romeo Langford  The ***only*** thing I fault Ainge for and felt was completely boneheaded in the moment was giving an aging undersized guard a 4 year $141M contract.  Other than that, I can't really think of anything he did wrong.  Hayward was an awful contract but at the time of the signing it seemed great.  And I don't put much stock into ""rumors"" that don't pan out, because none of us are in these front offices, and I would bet that over 80% of NBA rumors are complete BS made up either by reporters or GMs just as a smokescreen."
"This is a big tier, honestly probably the most interesting reveal of the whole thing.   The grinders tier I think is full of guys who have different skill sets. Aaron Gordon is on the list of guys who the idea of the player exceeds the reality not a fan. Think Marcus Smart is the best of that group by a distance dont think Jae Crowder or Aaron Gordon are in the category of as valuable as OG Anunoby or Smart. I actually think both Smart and Anunoby are better than Mikal Bridges.   This is putting ALOT of faith in a 17 game sample size of DeAndre Hunter and just ignoring a bad rookie year. Im not ready to go there at all. He talks about the perils of projecting with young players with Ayton and how if the season were 4 games shorter he might be higher we all overreact to small samples with young players all the time.   Damn he did it again after talking about not overvaluing stretch bigs putting Myles Turner this high lol. This is also putting too much faith in Robert Covington for my money who fouls everybody and has fallen off on ball defensively. A little high for Kemba Walker but I  dont hate it pendulum has swung too far against him."
They want him to back up Marcus smart? That’s tuff
"Yeah I mean these days its all over the place, but Marcus Smart for instance is 6'3 with a 6'9 wingspan... not the greatest shooter. Ray Allen on the other hand was 6'5 with about a 6'5 or 6'6 wingspan... one of the greatest shooters in the league. But again, these days it probably doesn't matter as much as when I was growing up playing bball lmao."
"&gt;I call BS. You obviously have Basketball Reference bookmarked, and is your go-to site for every basketball related argument.  Call whatever like, it doesn't make your argument anymore correct, or even sensible.  The bottom line is that I know what I'm talking about, and you've zero clue.  Maybe you should read more, if you think that's why I'm so much more knowledgeable than you?  &gt;Schroeder, the 3rd highest paid player, having the 3rd best offensive rating? That's nice. Could've been better.  Even for you, that's remarkably stupid.  &gt;You know what would be better? him coming off the bench and given a lesser role  Holy shit are you stupid.  Why don't you fire up some site and check the Lakers' roster, and tell us who should've been playing over Schroder.  For that matter, see how many players across the league were better starting point guards for less than $15.5M, who weren't still on rookie contracts.  &gt;and that's most likely going to be his role in the upcoming season in a Celtic uniform  So you think Marcus Smart is substantially better -- despite him shooting even worse than Schroder last year, and producing fewer assets despite playing with Tatum and Brown?  In point of fact, Smart+Brown was somehow the second-worst Celtic pair last season, and got outscored for the season, in nearly 1200 minutes together.  Some fucking how, Brown+Tatum+Smart also got outscored for the season last year, and was one of the worst Celtics' trios.  Again, this is why all of your conclusions are wrong -- you lack any grasp on the facts of the situation, and are just talking out of your asshole."
Yeah Dort is like a super charged Marcus smart. Who can defend guys like 6’6 and under really well due to strength and smarts. Mitchell might be the guy who can stick like glue on the Steph’s and Dame’s of the world. Other than Jrue no one else in the league is doing that.
I think it's the Cs if we're talking about opportunity. He would have Marcus Smart and Pritchard to battle for minutes and that's a little easier than Steph.
"No it’s not a foul. Some stars get that call though if they exaggerate the contact enough and at least get a half step on them. Davion was in front of him the whole time.  Also multiple guards like Jrue, Marcus Smart, Dejounte Murray, etc. guard up like this. Not every possession but you’ll definitely see it every game they play."
Yeah who's better? Dort and Jrue and Marcus Smart probably but not many more names come to mind
"He's kind of looking like an Isiah Thomas/Marcus Smart hybrid. Not as good as peak IT on offense, and not as good as Smart on defense due to being smaller, but can do a little of everything and brings a dawg mentality every night."
Never forget Bazemore 1) leaving Marcus Smart wide open 2) fucking up an open layup and 3) bricking 2 FTs all within 3 minutes to finish his masterclass of a game and waste Steph’s
Hah all a part of the Marcus smart experience. His good decisions definitely outweigh the bad ones though
You got that right lmao. Being a Celtics fans is nothing if not simultaneously loving Marcus Smart and wondering what the heck he’s doing out there
Lowry. Dude has managed to combine shades of the past in Manu Ginobili and modern day Marcus Smart in how he flops. Have to respect the shamelessness
"he edited his comment lol, he said Marcus Smart at first"
Celtics fans hate Marcus Smart?
Marcus smart
Marcus smart
You will show the Marcus Smart Celtics the respect they deserve
"In short sample sizes yes totally agree. Your talking about one gane or one week and start talking about how a guy looks, you have no idea the context of his play. Is he playing through some dings? Did he just break up with his girlfriend? Is he pressing mentally because he is trying to break out of a slump? Is he working on something new to his game? How was his sleep regimen that week? Was he trying to bulk up in the gym during that time and hitting it to hard?  The eye test is really only valid when looking at a players body of work for a full season+ and comparing it to the stats. A guy like Marcus Smart gets anneye test bonus on the season because his stats are mediocre but in the long haul he does a lot of things you would never see in stats and is always playing hurt. But in a single week the eye test would tell you he isn't very good outside a few plays. Opposite goes for a guy like Drummond. In a given week, the eye test would tell you this guy is a dominant force. But over the course of a whole season, the stats are bigger than the impact. You wind up with a guy that turns the ball over to much, is mediocre on defense, and wants to score even though he cant do it efficiently"
Can sub Marcus Smart too.
for some reason I imagine Marcus Smart being a lot older than he is
"Houston:  De'Aaron Fox  Stephen Jackson  Jimmy Butler  Emeka Okafor  De'Andre Jordan  We also have Justice Winslow, Kelly Oubre, Justin Jackson (Who all played for the Houston Hoops with Fox), TJ Ford, Gerald Green, Carsen Edwards, Quintin Grimes, Joe/Jacob/Michael Young, Jonthan Simmons   Dallas: *where l was born  Marcus Smart  Grant Hill  Julius Randle  Chris Bosh  LaMarcus Aldrige   Also CJ Miles, Isaiah Austin, and some young guys like Cade Cunningham, and RJ Hampton"
"If Marcus Smart hadn't had that crazy chase down block on Norm at the end of game 7, Raptors probably win. And that's with Siakam playing poorly in all 7 games that series"
shoulda won the marcus smart game. shoulda lost the OG game winner (that kemba dime was nasty)
"It means he doesn't have the athleticism needed to overpower/blow by defenders on his own. He doesn't have elite speed on the break.   Instead, he has a high basketball IQ that he uses to his advantage. He is probably one of those 'right place at the right time' kinda guys, who just have a knack for making an impact on plays in the game. His ability to hustle probably stands out, a la Marcus Smart (not necessarily to that level but you get the idea)"
"Philadelphia, Portland, Lakers, Clippers, Denver, Miami are a few teams that come to mind.  Possibly Boston but that depends upon keeping or trading Marcus Smart.    Note. In order for DG to go to Philly, obviously need to move BS."
Negative asset doesn’t mean “bad player.” Marcus Smart is really good but if he’s on a max contract he’s a negative asset.
"Lol! Marcus smart is the thumb nail, perfect!"
"Positions with PG/SG tend to be unclear, especially with defensive minded players so I just tried to fit in who I felt was the best guard defenders.  PG: Ben Simmons, Jrue Holiday, Kris Dunn, Dejounte Murray, Fred Van Vleet  SG: Marcus Smart, Paul George, Dillon Brooks, Alex Caruso, Luguentz Dort  SF: Matisse Thybulle, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, OG Anunoby, Lebron James  PF: Draymond Green, Giannis, Anthony Davis, Pascal Siakam, Robert Covington  C: Rudy Gobert, Joel Embiid, Bam Adebayo, Clint Capela, Myles Turner"
Shout out to Marcus Smart and Tony Allen.
Marcus Smart did the same to a glass picture frame
PG: CP0  SG: Marcus Smart  SF: LeBald  PF: ADisney   C: Vlade Divac
A team built around Marcus smart.
6th man: Marcus Smart
Marcus smart over Malone.  All nba rules (position less)
"You’re bringing up the Raptors who are irrelevant to this conversation. When you don’t have an argument you just go straight for the flair.   Yeah you’re betting on Alonso’s upside, and that potential + where he’s currently at makes him lore valuable than Marcus Smart in my opinion."
Marcus Smart: 13.1ppg on 53.9% TS  Keldon Johnson: 12.8ppg on 55.7% TS  The gap in defense is much greater than the gap in scoring efficiency.
Same Marcus Smart that shot sub 40% from the field?  His defense is better than Keldon I’ll give you that but not enough to make him better
Marcus Smart dismantled the raptors last playoffs.
"They literally do, in fact, amongst all plauers who shot between 33-34% or from 3 last season, Marcus Smart attempts the most 3-point shots per game at 5.6"
I love Smart as a player but 538 has always rated him laughably high.  [At point they compared him to Harden and Paul George and listed him as a future all-star.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo-2015-16/marcus-smart/)  [They also had him as the 25th best market value player earlier in the year.](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kf7idb/top_25_players_by_538_5yr_market_value_i_think/)
"You’re a stats guy, I get it, but I’ma let you in on a little secret, if defenders can’t sag off on you it makes it much, much easier to play basketball. Defenders go over on screens leading to wide open lanes, defenders don’t clog the paint for your teammates, and passing lanes are left much more open.  And Marcus Smart is not left wide open, I saw that you sneak edited that in. If you think he is you don’t watch the games."
"So? Defenders respect his shot. As I will repeat defenders respecting your shot matters much more than making your shots, especially when you’re a guard, and Marcus Smart is respected by defenders because he’ll kill you if he’s wide."
"I think that’s pretty fair for Marcus smart, the man can’t shoot, but he’s a dog on defense"
Yeah i would not want to be the person paying Marcus smart 24 million as good a he is i don’t think he’s worth that
How come Noone said marcus smart
Marcus smart for sure
"I feel like for someone AD’s build it’s almost always better to fall in a controlled manner than land awkwardly.  I can’t pull it up rn, but when Marcus Smart shoves Embiid, Embiid actually like twists mid air to land and slide onto his back, which seems like a really good way to avoid injuries to the knees."
some dudes will do anything for an advantage.  i cant hate cuz marcus smart is on my team.
"Yes, that explains about 2 out of the 57 fouls they took in the last five minutes. Fournier had a full-on Marcus Smart level flop for God's sakes"
"2019 FIBA World Cup team was pretty weak:  Derrick White, Donovan Mitchell, Joe Harris, Marcus Smart, Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Mason Plumlee, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Kemba Walker"
We will take one Marcus Smart please
"Yep, and I love Marcus Smart just like Raptors fans love Lowry.   Just like others hate Marcus, I hate Lowry. And no, Celtics fans are in no way worse than Lakers, Cowboys, Steelers, Yankees, etc."
&gt; I personally find him pretty easy to hate because he’s somewhat annoying with the flopping. Also I’m not a big fan of the Raptors or their fans.  But you guys have Marcus Smart and Boston sports fans at the worst North American sports lol
"There were rumors: https://thespun.com/nba/boston-celtics/nba-world-reacts-to-the-marcus-smart-trade-rumors-2   Obviously, now it looks like Smart will stay."
"If Marcus Smart is legitimately being traded, this could be the Dubs trying to create a TPE for him.  Smart would be a huge grab for their bench, and would even likely start half the year."
"Omg a differing opinion. They clearly have never watched ball ever because anyone who did, such as the Celtics FO, would share your opinion.  With that said...you are correct about everything else, imo. Marcus Smart being worth that much is SO last year."
"Get it done. I’m hugely biased toward Smart but this is a good deal for two reasons; it’s tradable if we want to make a move and if not, we’ve got a good player at a reasonable ￼rate. I hope he signs it, I want Marcus Smart on my team."
I would trade Marcus Smart for Kevin Durant right now no questions asked. This trade would make Boston much worse and Brooklyn a 1000x better.
Marcus Smart is a core player and worth being apart of the “Jays era”. He’s an overvalued defender who can’t keep his emotions in check and just chucks horrible threes in critical games. I’ll celebrate when he’s off the team.
"I’m kinda over Marcus Smart. That’s not to say I would want to trade him to L.A, Brooklyn or Philadelphia btw"
"I'm not sure about that either. Schroder's goal this year if he signs with Boston will be to showcase himself as much as possible, because he's gonna feel like millions of dollars are on the line. If he's getting limited minutes behind Marcus Smart and Payton Pritchard, he's probably gonna be pretty upset. He may also really force things when he's in there.   For all his faults with the Lakers, he wasn't really playing like that, probably because the Lakers seemed eager to offer him whatever he wanted already (that's the only reason he turned down that $84 million extension, after all). If he's suddenly taking a $10 million discount from what he made last year on what essentially would be a year long audition for free agency, who knows what kind of basketball he might play. It might be incredibly selfish and detrimental to what a rebuilding team is looking for. We'll have to wait and see."
Feels like a lot of money and commitment for Marcus Smart but that's probably why I'm not a GM
Marcus Smart for Schroeder. DO IT YOU COWARDS
"Nah Bill Simmons doesn't like Marcus Smart, whereas I obviously love him dearly."
Switched to CJ because he's American.  How about  - Porter Jr. for knockdown 3s and solid rebounding  - Jarrett Allen for post play  - Marcus Smart off the bench for defense and hustle
Marcus Smart and Patrick Beverly
"Keep dreaming lol, Schroder’s not worth anything close to Marcus Smart.  The Celtics can’t give him the money he wants, if he’s coming here it’s for a mid-level deal where he tries to prove that he’s worth more next off-season.  We’re probably the best team that he can be the lead ball handler on."
"Marcus Smart. I get why people call him a flopper, but he does a *lot* more on defense than just draw calls"
"That’s a really good point. I feel like a swap centered around Marcus Smart (and other assets) for CJ would make sense for both Boston and Portland.   Boston ups its shooting, Portland ups its toughness and defense, and Dame and Smart I think would be more complimentary than CJ and Dame."
[You legitimately believe that Dennis Schroder would net Marcus Smart in a trade](https://np.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/oynl6k/guy_boston_sports_on_twitter_the_celtics_have_had/h7udxaf/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3)
We are NOT trading Marcus Smart for Schroder. That would be a massive downgrade.
Marcus Smart
We going to get Marcus Smart or what.
"Would you look at that. All those Celtics downvotes yesterday when I said this and here we are yet again. 😂  Folks swear up and down the Celtics don't want to do this deal, but they won't extend Marcus Smart who is coming up on the last year of his deal. They need a PG. Unless you're telling me Toronto is sending Dragic to Boston, this seems like a likely, however begrudgingly, trade."
"Again, were not giving up FRPS for Marcus smart   We can't sign and trade for him because we would be hard capped anyway   If Denis goes to the celtics , he's losing his bird rights and taking the MLE"
"Why are Lakers fans acting like they're gonna get Marcus Smart for Schroder, lol."
"It wouldn't put you in the tax if you traded Marcus Smart for him. After all, Smart's extension talks apparently are going really poorly and it's been said for a while that Boston might trade him cause they're unwilling to pay him."
The Celtics aren't trading Marcus Smart for Schroder lmfao.
"Is Marcus Smart on the block? Would the Celtics honestly trade him for Schroeder and all of the Lakers 2nd round? If they’re interested in DS for around $30/3 and want to get rid of Smart, I don’t know, I feel maybe a trade here could play out.   If the Celtics don’t want DS or want him for very cheap, the no, this wouldn’t work. I’m only assuming they have at least modest interest in him and that they do wanna get rid of Smart."
No team would trade two firsts for Marcus Smart
"Dude, this is not ideal for the Celtics.  he will take shots away from their best guys and likely get in a fight with Marcus Smart at some point."
We're not giving up FRPs for Marcus smart lol
Imagine the Lakers getting Marcus smart by getting off Shroeder and two future firsts lol.
"Marcus Smart, Romeo Langford, maybe a pick"
"&gt;Thad is probably one of the few players I'd willingly trade Marcus Smart for.  this excites me for his value, really!  boston is one of my favourite destination for him, but the salaries do not match at all.  The trade idea you suggest is a nice start, but seems helal difficult to fully arrange. mainly because if you cannot find a contender willing to take an expiring Thad Young for a 1st, I do not see others do it for Joe who earns even more."
"Hmm, some 3-way trade where Joe Harris goes to another contender, Thad Young goes to Brooklyn, and that third team sends the Spurs some expiring salary/intriguing prospect and a late 1st? I don't know.   But you're right in that it's difficult, he makes slightly more than that 11.5m exception that Brooklyn has.   TBH I wish my team would trade for him, Thad is probably one of the few players I'd willingly trade Marcus Smart for."
"Marcus Smart is a better player than Dennis Schroder by several times. If it comes to having to pay Marcus versus having to pay Dennis, 100/100 people pick paying Marcus."
"I saw a post earlier about Boston and Schroder discussing a possible deal and imo, a S&amp;T with Boston makes sense for both sides. I don't think Brad wants to pay Marcus Smart, and they do need a PG. They could give it to Schroder if they think he could be a long term answer. Marcus Smart on the Lakers makes sense for them too. It's a win for both ball clubs but there is the rub about the Lakers and Celtics actually doing a mutually beneficial deal cause.. it's the Celtics. 🤢"
"What free agent class?  f Brooklyn's big three extends this off-season, Zach Lavine will be the only top tier free agent available and Chicago can offer more money, a better market and a comparable winning situation.  The next tier sucks. It's pretty much Aaron Gordon, TJ Warren, Jusuf Nurkic and Marcus Smart with Michael Porter Jr, Colin Sexton and Jaren Jackson Jr. as restricted free agents that would almost certainly get matched."
It's the DJ fiasco. I remember working my shitty retail job just refreshing the page every few minutes and dying at every update.    But seconds are the Bucks fans pitch to Dwight Howard. Or the tweets about Marcus smart yelling stuff from the bathroom.
Marcus smart is steph curry next to Ben tho
"How come Embiid gets a pass in all of this? His conditioning is shit, he gets hurt often, and he’s soft. Biggest flopper in the league after Marcus smart.  He’s a big mouth loser that never beat anyone but it’s Brett Brown’s fault, or Doc’s, or Harris’, or Simmons. Embiid is the anchor right? The best player on the team? The face of the franchise? Always puts it on others. Joel got a bit of Dwight Howard in him."
"&gt; With a shot people actually have to guard him on the three point line  The problem is that developing a shot good enough to force a defender to guard Simmons out to the 3pt line is a gargantuan task. He would need to be a league-average 3pter shooter with a bomber's mentality (like 2015-2017 Marcus Smart before his efficiency improved) or actually be an elite shooter to make it worth it for the defense to come out to guard him. Even with a decent form to start with, building that kind of shot takes a tremendous amount of time. Maybe he could do it by swapping hands and shooting jumpshots with his right so that he doesn't have to tear down his current form first, but even then it would still be the task of multiple off-seasons and probably wouldn't fully pay off until 4+ years down the line.  I think the best comparison for building a jumpshot mostly from scratch in the NBA is Blake Griffin, and it took Griffin 6 years before he even started taking more than 1 3pt shot per game. And Griffin started out from a better place than Simmons did, too. Certainly a much better place than where Simmons' shooting ability is now!  Simmons getting a jumpshot good enough to be guarded at the 3pt line would be amazing but I'd say it's so unlikely to happen before next year that the Sixers would have a better chance of trading Simmons for Steph Curry than for him to manage that."
idk dude. Kyle Lowry &amp; Marcus Smart go toe to toe with Draymond in that department I believe.
"Made an ill advised dive for a loose ball, clearly regretted hitting Collins' knee, and now he's ""out here diving into people's knees left and right."" Surely you're just as critical of Marcus ""push in the back"" Smart if you hate dirty plays so much!"
Why seths wife on here with a Marcus smart profile name
"I’m not so sure. That’s a max contract slot. You don’t get infinite maxes. So your market is really just teams far enough out of contention that they’ve got slots to spare. If you’re a few parts away from contention, you literally just found out this guy isn’t going to be the piece to get you into it. It’s a waste of a slot that could be better filled by trading for someone like KAT instead.   You need a Presti to move him. And their motivation to take Simmons isn’t gonna be high with a full-length max contract extension just now kicking in. This entire story is about Simmons the Contract more than Simmons the Player. If he’s making Marcus Smart money, we’re not having this conversation."
Okc  Marcus Smart + Fournier and like 2FRPs. Simmons would be perfect for us behind Tatum and Brown
Plays with more heart and energy too. You can say a lot about Marcus Smart but he isn’t scared of the moment
Marcus Smart is better player
This is very similar to Marcus smart fans for the Celtics. It doesn't matter how many games he loses with bad shots. If he makes one hustle play they are all back to hyping up his winning basketball.
"Kidd shot like Marcus smart, not Ben Simmons"
"anyone that hates on Marcus Smart would love him if he were on their favorite team.  At a minimum he hits 80% of his free-throws and would never, ever, ever pass up a dunk if he had one"
Idk how people can’t see by now Marcus Smart is one of the most valuable role players in the league and ALWAYS shows up in the playoffs. He was the second best Celtic in the Nets series
Ain’t due to Marcus smart that’s for sure LMFAOOOO
"even if the salaries/contracts matched I literally wouldn't trade Marcus Smart for Ben Simmons.  If I'm Portland and Philly calls about McCollum, I'd ask them how many picks they're including in that deal, too.  Why would any team that's trying to get over the top in the playoffs trade for Simmons?  And why would any rebuilding team want to pay that salary?"
"the first step towards being a threat to score is being a threat to shoot. thats why teams still blanketed marcus smart on 3's even while he was a sub 30% shooter  if youre a threat to go 0/12 youre also a threat to go 6/12. but a dude who never shoots in the first place is a guy the defense straight up doesnt needa worry about  this is the massive difference between someone like lu dort who couldnt hit fucking anything for the first few games of last years playoffs but continued to shoot despite that and ended up having the game of his life and was nearly a game 7 hero, and someone like roberson or simmons who never even put themselves in that position"
Ben Simmons is the most frustrating player to watch in all of basketball. Him and Marcus Smart lol.
Marcus Smart. Man isn't a liability in the playoffs unlike someone else
Obv Marcus Smart lmao
Marcus smart actually attempts shots
"Again, I would not trade Marcus Smart for ben Simmons straight up"
Marcus Smart makes winning plays.
dude I wouldn't trade Marcus Smart for Ben Simmons straight up
Marcus Smart is better than literally everybody on the Sixers roster
You cannot talk with Marcus fucking smart on your team LMFAOOOO
"Lol he was physical one game but there were a number of phantom fouls, so it more than evens out.  I wouldn't expect you to understand that though considering you think Blake Griffin is like Marcus Smart."
And we don't even have the master Marcus Smart!
Marcus smart honorable mention
Marcus Smart
"Wtf is AD doing in this list, And Marcus Smart is still in the league"
I wish the fans would actually flop like the Iowa State fans did when Marcus Smart shot free throws. It was so funny. I wonder how many player would have FT shots affected after that.
“That’s not basketball” after running over Marcus Smart.
"For me I really don’t want Marcus being the starting point long term. I can think of multiple times last year where the defender would start pressuring him and he would lose the ball.   I love smart but he’s an average at best ball handler, though I do think he’s a good passer and playmaker."
"Not a fan.   Scoring-wise his peak was as a higher volume Marcus Smart.  * Spencer last season: 20.6ppg on 41.5/30.8/77.8 splits (54.1TS%)  * Marcus this season: 13.1ppg on 39.8/33.0/79.0 splits (53.9 TS%)   **And then** you add in the fact he's coming back from a major injury.  Like Smart, he's a better player than his numbers suggest, but at the end of the day we need guys who can make shots efficiently and you can't have Smart + High Volume Smart in an elite offence."
"It’s definitely been downhill since the Hayward injury. A few years ago this team has Kyrie, Hayward, horford, Tatum and Brown. With a bench of smart, Marcus Morris, rozier. Ainge built his contender with 2 young budding stars to boot.   Ever since Hayward and Kyrie didn’t work out, there’s been an exodus of talent and a lot of moves that haven’t really worked out. It was time for a shakeup"
"for real, if he could just call out the other players when they're choosing bad shots like Rondo or Marcus Smart he would be even better for them."
*insert Marcus Smart thinking meme*
"He's the best dude in the league at getting three 3's in the fourth that your team doesn't need. Also best at trying to get six 3's in the fourth when you need them, and hitting none.  I love Marcus Smart though."
"No, since he is not inbounds, this has happened before with either Jae Crowder or Marcus Smart when Crowder was on the Celtics."
"I don't think Stevens was ever a bad coach tbh, obviously none of us can know how he feels unless he comes out later with a tell all but to my uneducated eyes it seemed like he was just worn out coaching the pro game. Guys not caring, guys not trying and clearly guys like brown and Tatum tuning him out now that they're ""superstars"" and getting mad that he was favoring Marcus smart. No shit the coach loves the only guy who's willing to run back every possession and actually give effort. To me articles like this always reflect badly on the players involved not necessarily the coach unless we're talking a Lloyd pierce or boylen for the bulls"
The only time i've seen Harden being so dumb was when he fouled Marcus Smart twice.
"This exactly. If you put Gobert on this Clipper team, for example, they would easily be the best defensive team in the league even without Kawhi. That's because the Clippers have elite wing defenders. The Jazz front office said fuck it to having any wing defenders and put all the defensive pressure on Gobert. That kind of roster construction isn't going to work in the playoffs. if they had a guy like Jae Crowder/Marcus Smart the defense would be completely different. Also, the coaching was bad too. How were the Jazz defenders so bad on their rotations when the Clippers were running the same play over and over."
the day that marcus smart is traded from the C’s is the day that ben simmons makes a 4 point play
Marcus smart deserves every minute he can get though
What coach wouldn't favor Marcus Smart. He's a class act
Celtics will be fine. They have two really great young players locked down and they can always move pieces like Marcus Smart around.
"&gt; yall talkin all this shit about blake and legit havent even watched him all year. dont talk about me not knowing what blake is like when its obvious you havent watched the nets at all. he leads the league in charges this year.  Haha that classic argument - you don't agree because you don't watch him like I do.  I've watched his whole career, including his Nets career. He is nothing like Marcus Smart."
"I mean Simmons performance has nothing to do with Marcus smart does it, I mean can u say that Simmons is playing bad without it having anything to do with Marcus smart I never denied Simmons is playing like shit I literally said nothing about him. Keep the same energy bud"
"""Never lived up to the billing, for whatever reason?"" This sounds like some revisionist history, let me refresh your memory.  2013-15: Rebuilding years, no expectations yet arguably exceeded them by making the playoffs in 2015 in a weak eastern conference.   2015-16: Lost to 4th seeded Atlanta hawks in the first round as the 5th seed. One of ONLY two teams to beat the Warriors at home this year. In fact, was the team to break their NBA record 54 game home winning streak. Both games with the NBA best warriors that year were highly competitive with the first being a double OT loss at home. Arguably no other team was as competitive with the warriors this season and Celtics would continue to be one of the most competitive teams with the warriors in the next couple seasons. (this is objectively the definition of not meeting but exceeding your billing)  2016-17: Lost in the conference finals as the one seed to the Lebron James led cavaliers, something James has a history of doing to top seeds. Went down to Chicago 0-2 AT HOME in the first round but after Brad Stevens made the decision to bench Amir Johnson in favor of Gerald Green the Celtics went on to win four straight. Three of which were in Chicago. Great coaching decision led to a series win.  2017-18: Acquired Gordon Hayward and Kyrie (via trade) and lost Hayward on DAY ONE of the season, and Kyrie later that season. Still took the cavs to seven games and eventually lost. Cavs would get swept by the dubs. Celtics split the season series with the Warriors and steph curry remarked ""It's looking very, very likely right now"" as to answer a question asking if they would see the Celtics in the finals. This was Jayson Tatum's first season and Brown's second, yet still made it very far without Kyrie at the end and Gordon for the entire year spare for a few minutes.  2018-19: Highly dysfunctional team with logjams at multiple positions. However, I do NOT pin this on Brad. As a Celtics fan I will never forgive Danny Ainge for being a giant pussy and not making a big trade this year. We had the assets and the NEED to given the crowded roster and he didn't do shit.   2019-20: Lost to Miami Heat in conference finals. Could not figure out Miami's zone. I'll give you this year. Kemba totally sucked all playoffs but still should have beaten the Heat.  2020-21: Celtics led the league in games missed due to Covid protocol. On top of that injuries to Marcus Smart, Kemba Walker (who never played back to backs and missed many other games), and eventually a season ending one to Jaylen Brown never allowed the team to gain any continuity. Celtics lost in the first round to arguably the most talented team ever assembled in the Brooklyn Nets.   Even if you blame Brad partially for this past season that's stil only 1.5 out of 8 seasons in which they didn't live up to the hype. To say his teams ""never"" lived up to the billing is just incorrect. I spent way more time on this than I should have"
Yeah Blake is nothing like Marcus Smart. You don't know what you're talking about.
Marcus Smart is on this list by reputation at this point
How the fuck you gonna insert yourself in a conversation about flopping with Marcus smart on your team?
We are not starting the Marcus Smart disrespect this early today
Y’all would’ve liked him. He’s like a Marcus smart type.
"You could tell in the bubble, especially after the marcus smart locker room rampage game, that they stopped responding to him. Great X’s and O’s guy but his approach to motivation was pretty much “disappointed gym teacher”"
Against who wizards and bulls and don’t forget Big Al  I.T Crowder Bradley Marcus Smart
Brad Stevens and Marcus Smart come from the old school tough love coaching mentality. But many young generation today don't respond well to that and prefer to be coddled and reassured
Probably the only players on that list. Kemba is a no and Marcus Smart won't make the Olympic team. Nobody else was that good.  (Unless Jaylen Brown was on the team but he's hurt anyways)
But marcus smart can… https://youtu.be/elshVMYAKwA
I’m very shocked that jazz fans turn on him so fast. Haha.. how is gobert supposed to guard the perimeter ? It’s like asking Marcus smart to guard the paint.
Marcus Smart isn't providing comparable value at the rim but keep up with the circle jerking.
"MAYBE bigs should stop being a lock for DPOY, you think anyone seeks out Marcus Smart on the switch? Is that a defender you want to take your chances with?!  Give some consideration to shorter players for the DPOY award!"
Tatum ? I’m not even sure boston will trade Marcus smart for him. 40 mln per year contract. Add that to tatum and brown. That’s about it
"Well Marcus Smart fits better with Luka, so him."
"Simmons just a glorified Marcus Smart this series  I feel like he has all he needs to be better, he just doesn't tap into"
I think Marcus Smart is going to have a breakout year next season and step into that 3/D/Playmaking guard the Celtics need
Trade guys for assets just to trade back for them in 3 years Celtics will trade Marcus Smart to OKC for Kemba  Walker and 4 1st round picks but I'm surprised OKC is giving up Moses Brown he's good what's SGA thinking about his team.
"I think he's a good fit with us given he's been around a team that has a similar model (The Jays are discount Kawhi + PG) and IMO he could do a lot for Marcus Smart in terms of bringing out better decision making in him more consistently.  Also, if he's anything like T-Lue, he'll go small often, and I'm in favor of that."
"&gt; Sounds exactly like Chauncey. I don’t think there’s a better player to relate to them than a player who worked damn hard, was a top glue guy, insanely cool and calm in big situations and was a top player in the league, all while having a super high basketball IQ   Yup, and I think he would be amazing for Marcus Smart. I think he would increase the ratio of how often we get Marcus Smart games as opposed to Marcus Dumb games.   &gt; Tactically I really have no idea how he’d do though  If he's anything like T-Lue, he'll go small a lot and in favor of offense and I'm on board with that.   That would mean a lot of Jabari Parker at the 5 lmao."
"Yeah I mean every team wants wings lol, in and of itself not the end of the world. Issue really is they could use better than Marcus Smart as their best passer. Which the current plan is to try to hope that several decent playmakers cumulatively make up for it and Fournier contributes to that. They have to really like Nesmith to be willing to give up the pick this yr. Is he going to end up becoming a better player than Evan Fournier within the next 2 yrs, idk, probably a bit much too expect.   But I dont disagree with the general idea their hope is internal improvement, and guys on their roster hitting like their &gt;90th percentile possible outcome(TimeLord espec). Just macro level this is a hard team to have extreme takes on in either direction. Tatum/Brown keeps the floor high enough where this yr is close to as bad as itll get. But there also isnt a clear path for them being much more than some 48-52 win type team in coming yrs unless they hit the jackpot somewhere. So how the team is evaluated is all about how you frame the discussion."
"Kembas owed 75 million, horford 54.   Horford will also see the floor much more often than Kemba, fits a positional need, and is still a positive contributor. The best parts of kembas contributions can be matched by Marcus Smart, and he doesn't suffer the lack of availability that kemba does.   Its not a win now move, its getting an albatross of their neck."
"I'm fine starting Marcus at the one, honestly. I figure we'll be probably putting the ball in Tatum's hands more, and Smart is a capable passer who honestly needs to lean more into that and less into taking threes off the dribble"
"Celtics are set at center now, which they were undermanned at before. Robert Williams/Al Horford/Moses Brown is a really good rotation  I wonder if this is a sign that Brad has faith in Marcus Smart as the starting PG, or if more is to come"
Start Marcus Smart at Point Guard?
Marcus Smart.
"I desperately want a big guard than can defend and hit open threes in the Josh Hart / Malcolm Brogdon / George Hill mold. Just talking type, not availability.  The next step for both Tatum and Brown is to be the primary initiator so I don't think our PG needs to be that guy necessarily. They do need to be competent as a secondary ball handler though and - good god this is important - make better decisions than Marcus Smart."
"No.  It’s a genuinely bad trade for Boston imo. You need a point guard with kembas skills to run a playoff offense.   Unless they are seeing a marcus smart transition to being a halfcourt creator, they are going to look like the sixers in the playoffs now.  Tatum and brown have pretty much always had an elite point guard scorer throughout their career between IT, Kyrie, Kemba. They are going to look insanely ugly without one."
Bro I'll drive Kuzma to Boston myself for Marcus Smart
"So you failed to realize that the Bucks attacked the paint more? What if we took away Hardens calls that were flops? It’d be even more lopsided. Maybe they’ll switch it up and actually beat and bang inside, but until then, Milwaukee will get more calls on that aspect alone.  Edit: Hardens the best at deceiving the refs. Marcus Smart a close second. I’m"
If he goes there Marcus Smart is so fucked lol.
"Brown, Marcus Smart and a couple firsts might do it lol"
"Asking ""Is Marcus Smart a point guard?"" means you have not been watching the Celtics"
"Don’t worry, it’s all coming together. Now we got Horford and Timelord as our backcourt, Moses Brown and Tristan Thompson as our wings, and Marcus Smart as our center. We’ll be unstoppable"
I can't wait for him to trade Marcus Smart lmao. Just delete all the old comments of him talking about how important to the celtics culture he was
"&gt; You ship him off to wherever and they get max space I believe  Not if Fournier resigns for more than a year, and you probably have to renounce Rob Williams and Marcus Smart"
"A lot of people are going to turn their nose up at this... but I think this is the start of Marcus Smart playing point like he should've been for a long time.   He's above average as a PnR ball handler, has generally had very good (some season even elite) assist to turnover ratios, and has tended to be a better shooter off the dribble than on the catch."
"Kemba was *supposed* to be the third guy to pair with Jason and Jaylen, but that didn’t work out. I thought the Kemba signing was a panic move anyway after Kyrie left.   That being said, this deal doesn’t make us all that much better on the court, as the Jays are now looking at like Marcus smart to be the 3rd offensive option which is *not* ideal. This move is good for the lockeroom (love Als leadership) and a new coach will help the culture as well.   End of the day though talent wins rings, and we still have a void for a 3rd option. This is a good *first* move but can’t be the last."
If Kemba is gone I would imagine they keep Marcus Smart and Fournier  Lonzo is a interesting option but he seems kind of expensive
It was a panic signing to replicate Kyrie except ur never gonna replicate a guy of his caliber. Marcus would be a fine PG and Tatum and Brown can play the wings or you can start Fournier who was really redundant with Kemba there anyway. Horford also can space the floor.  Your starting lineup is   Smart who is one of the best defensive guards in the league and an excellent playmaker  Fournier who was averaging almost 20 in orlando  Tatum and Brown for the 3 and the 4  Horford who is a great defender and can shoot at center and this was a big weakness before as it was Tristan Thompson starting
What? Marcus smart always has a lot of steals. Can you name any great defenders who don’t get atleast 1 block or 1 steal per game?
Defense isn’t just about steals and blocks. Marcus Smart is a legit DPOTY level defender but doesn’t quite get that recognition because stats just can’t show the impact he has.
Yeah. He’s a non-douche Marcus Smart.
Marcus Smart is the most valuable player for the Celtics.
I'm pretty sure he's softer than marcus smart
"Mikal Bridges, Marcus Smart, Thybulle, O.G. Anouby, Bam, Gobert, Royce O'Neale, Draymond Green, Dort, AD, Paul George, Giannis, Simmons, Embiid, Isaac are some players that come to my mind right now that are currently on my favorite defensive players to watch.  I appreciate defense, especially isolation defense as you said.   Peak Kawhi, Josh Smith, Tony Allen, Marc Gasol, Tim Duncan, Bryant, KG, are some of my favorite defenders back in the days to watch.   Man, it's almost criminal to this day that Duncan's never ever won DPOY...."
Ben simmons is a taller Marcus Smart
"The core of a trade where CJ and draft compensation leaves Portland and Ben Simmons goes to Portland seems to fit perfectly for Portland - Ben fills their need of a wing defender, secondary ball handler, rebounder, guy to run the fast break, and a dude who can keep the ball moving on offense, while being the fifth option. Meanwhile they get to move on from one of their two starting SGs to get an actual wing. Dame/Norm/Ben/RoCo/Nurk is an incredible roster.   I think the Sixers could turn some combination  of CJ, Seth, Danny, picks, and young players (thybulle, maxey, etc) into a SF and/or PG. maybe Marcus Smart for Danny Green and a 1st, that way you have your ball handler and defense.   All you need at that point is a SF in return for CJ or Seth plus picks and/or young guys, and maybe George Hill as filler. Maybe some combination of George Hill, Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, and 1sts for Jerami Grant? I could see Detroit being interested in Maxey, Milton, and 1sts.   Smart/CJ/Grant/Harris/Embiid with Seth as sixth man looks really solid to me."
"I’ve been saying this everywhere! Ben fits every need the blazers have and let’s them move one of their extra starting SGs for an actual wing. Gets them defense, rebounding, secondary ball handling, a guy to score on fast breaks, and a guy who can keep the ball moving on offense. He’d find Dame so many open looks when he’s taking his turns running point  It would be CJ and 2 1sts or a three way trade where Sixers get a SF and/or PG, imo. Maybe a move is in there somewhere where they ship out one of Seth or Danny for Marcus Smart so they have someone who can actually run the point and play D"
Really?  Marcus Smart punches and headbutts people?
He reminds me of Marcus Smart so much
Marcus Smart is literally on your team.
"There’s a line between being scrappy and dirty. Brooks is scrappy, Allen is dirty.  Marcus Smart is scrappy, Draymond is dirty.  Gafford is scrappy, Valanciunas is dirty."
Marcus smart wish he played like brooks
Hey hey hey Brooks is more Marcus Smart than Grayson Allen. Not a dirty player that trips people
Bro your own beloved player Marcus Smart wrote a whole article on it Celtics fans are in denial.
"Yeah, but its a twitter poll. If there was a twitter poll ""would you trade Marcus Smart for Lebron James"" then I might click no just because Marcus Smart is life and I want to show him love. But if I was Ainge then I would probably make that trade."
He's alot better than Marcus Smart
Jimmy Butler is a glorified Marcus Smart
"I hate this sub more than Marcus Smart. Ya’ll know it all.   ThAt WaS a ClEaR FoUl On KyRiE.   Bruh, watch any top level player drive with the ball - 100% of them post with their offhand - 100% of them.  Smart sold the contact, he also does this when there’s no contact. He’s a top 10 flopper in the league."
They were hyperfocusing him tho because our second option is literally Marcus Smart
"hell yeah, marcus smart definitely renowned for being soft!"
"Are you really using defensive winshares to claim that harden has been near him defensively?   Do you watch the games? All these stats measure the exact same thing....BPM? Really? So is KD better peak for peak than shaq? Because KD has a higher playoff BPM multiple times years.  And using plus minus ortg.....That can be swayed by literally 1 quarter, Marcus smart his like 5 threes when Harden sat at the end of the first which swayed the metric.   Lol cmon man....harden has only been more impactful in game 3, particularly the first half. Outside of that it’s been Kd. I’m not using  bball ref stats in 2021 or else I’d be coming away with the fact that Jokic is the best player of all time......."
"The general zeitgeist of ""Lol Nets in 3"" made it such that the Celtics and the fans were playing with house money, that even 1 win would be a success. Tatum is still a superstar, Marcus Smart is still a Celtics lifer and TT has shown a lot against a quality big-challenged Nets team. For the future, Langford went 2-7 but the stats don't show how much he (and Nesmith) played hard on defense, Grant too, he had some great switches and close outs on KD.   If this is like 2016, and we win both home games, we're gonna go nuts. Even if they don't, I'd say we've shown a decent theory vs the Nets (force iso, attack Harris, Griffin and even Irving) that teams like Milwaukee might be able to get more out of.  Tl;dr: we didn't get swept, rookies looked good, we won on with Tatum 50, and we made the Nets look mortal, and other teams playing Nets should obliterate the Nets bigs with Green out"
"I guess the direct quote is ambiguous, but seems like he's referring to in the arena:   ""Yeah, I've heard it. I've heard a couple of things,"" Smart said of Boston fans making racist comments, per Yahoo Sports' Keith Smith. ""It's hard to hear that and then have them support us as players. It's kind of sad and sickening.""  [source](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/celtics-marcus-smart-danny-ainge-comments-kyrie-irving/1923x595g2bg312hdgxjgh4rna)"
"Maybe Boston doesn't ban people for racist remarks?  Marcus Smart said he's heard racist remarks, and he's on your team."
"Yeah, I thought it was only gonna be guys like Marcus Smart that would kill him in the post, but seeing the snake get destroyed by any guard is hilarious"
"Imagine having KD, Harden and Kyrie and losing to Jayson Tatum, Marcus Smart, Tristian Thompson and some dude who's last name is literally a dick disease?"
The charge call on marcus smart last night was overturned cuz the nba wanted the nets to win.
"So, I'm a Marcus Smart fan and I love defense, but is the call really as outlandish as the comments imply? It looks to me that Durant is running and Smart is purposely sidestepping into his path. I'm not saying the defender has to have his feet planted, but he can't be shuffling sideways into the runner's path either."
"""I'm trying to figure out, how do take a look at that and come away from that thinking that's a foul on Marcus Smart?""  Because it's Marcus vs Durant. Obviously the broadcast can't say that, but Durant gets this call 9/10 times because he's the darling  The call was so putrid, ~~but I suppose they decided his left foot lifted a millisecond before Durant ran into him. It's the only reasoning~~  My mistake, he was planted completely now that I see it a bunch of times"
I thought it was going to be the final nail in the coffin when they put them in the penalty with like 5 minutes to go.   The overturn on Marcus Smart was insane Durant quite literally shoves him and tries to run through him
"That's an *ok* call during the live action to rule it a foul on Smart, and if that was the original call I could see being unable to over turn it.  But calling it a charge and *then* overturning it based on that replay is inexcusable.   There was not enough evidence on that video to warrant overturning that call as it could have gone either way makes it too ambiguous to be able to overturn confidently.  Marcus Smart is entitled to the space he takes over before KD tries to assume that space."
"Clippers maybe, Celtics not a chance. Celtics would need legendary perfomances from everybody and Marcus smart and Fournier are not the players to do that reguardless of what Tatum does"
"just as everybody expected, the offensive firepower of Tatum, Tristan Thompson, and Marcus Smart was too much for the Nets."
I was just watching the replay of the game. Holy shit that foul called on Griffin while he was down on the floor and Marcus smart ran by him and immediately did a somersault over him to draw the foul. Dudes on another level
Meanwhile Marcus Smart goes down over a glancing touch—and the NBA dgaf about protecting the integrity of the sport—it’s a shame!!!
KP at his peak couldn't make Marcus Smart budge
"Even at his peak, smaller, stronger guys could shut him down. Marcus Smart owned him."
Marcus “Lebron” Smart
Marcus Smart has been in admirable territory on his flops for years now
Marcus Smart has never flopped in his life. He just makes winning plays
"I have no idea how some guys get all the calls and some guys don’t. It appears completely independent of style of play and motion. There are guys who seek them out, brook Looez sweeps his arms down and Marcus smart loves those charges - But like Jimmy Butler gets so many FT opportunities , and I don’t know how he does it. He doesn’t seem to even sell it that much. I wonder if it’s just momentum."
"Surprised refs didn't start off with off sides Timo Werner, Marcus Smart has been disqualified"
the Marcus Smart call
Yes. They were pretty good from what I saw. Probably the most controversial call that I saw was that KD vs Marcus Smart charge/foul.
"Yeah but that his been his whole career, Marcus smart still locks him up. Dude has zero post game"
Marcus Smart will be Hokage
Marcus Smart when he's hitting his 3s looks like a goddamn All-Star. Made up for Kemba tonight.
"Marcus Smart is gonna be a finals MVP some day. Whether or not it's with us, there will be serious debate over whether or not he'll have deserved it. And whether or not it's with us, he 100% will have deserved it."
Marcus Smart would be playing in China
"Honestly? You guys are a floor general away from being a contender. I’ve always thought Marcus Smart is a good PG to start, because he’s actually super solid at running an offense, but he’s injury prone and inconsistent on offense as well"
....the subject of the thread is marcus smart flops why wouldnt that be the comp?
Holy fuck Marcus Smart literally died on the court.
Marcus Smart would be proud lol
No but that is Marcus “We in the playoffs” Smart
2017 cavs game 4 Marcus smart showed up
Was a god awful call. How tf was that on Marcus smart
"I too am ecstatic about the win, but Harden was pretty damn great. He's like an elite scoring Marcus Smart."
I still remember those five 3-pointers he hit all in a row against Toronto. Texted my brother to say “I think Marcus Smart might be a god.” He responded “he sure thinks he is” LOL. The man plays with so much damn confidence
Straight up bulldozing a set Marcus Smart.    I chuckled when it happened and was in disbelief when they overturned.
That Marcus Smart flop did not deserve to be a foul lmao. It’s a problem when players are not even trying to play defense they’re just trying to flop their way to a foul. Can’t enable that behavior
Marcus Smart...
I feel so dirty for cheering for the Celtics this series but can’t lie…Tatum and Marcus smart are fun
Our second option is literally Marcus Smart lol
Kemba's really gotta show up if the Celtics are gonna stand a chance. We can't rely on 20 point games from Marcus Smart and JT being a god every night.
"Marcus Smart had a hell of a game, though."
"Marcus Smart man. Hes that love him if he’s on your team, hate him with all that is holy if not. Hell of a fuckin game by that dude."
&gt; also happened before your parents were old enough to think about producing spawn like you.  Did Marcus Smart and Tristan Thompson play back then?
"James Harden's flops are effective, but they don't take your breathe away and inspire.  As a longtime flop observer, I feel like I'm as qualified as anyone to judge.  You're also mistaking my post as a criticism of Marcus Smart when it's actually a shrine to his greatness."
“Dear r/bostonceltics. Fuck You” Marcus Smart (definitely)
"Jayson Tatum, Deuce, Marcus Smart, James Harden, and Luka Doncic."
Damn Marcus Smart truly the reigning champ of the flop. It's actually an art form with him now.
"What an outstanding game from Tatum, and let's not forget some great contributions from the likes of Tristan Thompson, Marcus Smart, and Evan Fournier."
Marcus Smart clutch asf td those were clean flops
"Marcus Smart is gonna be a finals MVP some day. Whether or not it's with us, there will be serious debate over whether or not he'll have deserved it. And whether or not it's with us, he 100% will have deserved it."
Yo don’t disrespect our CELTIC Marcus Smart
"I hate Boston, but there's no way to not like Tatum and JB. Fuck Marcus Smart, anyways."
I'm happy with this call. Celtics still win and we get the Marcus Smart gif with incredible meme potential.
Marcus smart just got a new meme with that clip
LEGENDARY MARCUS SMART JPG RIGHT THERE
marcus smart with the new meme
Marcus Smart trying to flop his team to victory.
This is a complete Marcus Smart performance. Perfect combination of flopping and drawing legit offensive fouls. Even taking/making shots without killing the Celts offense.
This is the most Marcus Smart of Marcus Smart games.  1. unconscious stretch of 3s 2. Heat check gone horribly wrong 3. Over aggressive bad fouls 4. Draws like 4 fouls with mixed heavy embellishment 5. Bad 3 5 seconds in to the play clock
Tatum turned into prime MJ and Marcus Smart into prime Gary Payton this game
Marcus Smart is a dog.
MARCUS FUCKING SMART  STFU r/bostonceltics
Marcus smart is a disgrace to basketball
"KD just ran straight into Marcus Smart, what the hell was expecting?"
Man I never expected I would love marcus smart this much
MARCUS SMART IS A RUSHMORE BOSTON ATHLETE CHANGE MY MIND
I WILL DIE FOR THIS TEAM  especially Marcus Smart
#MARCUS SMART DOING MARCUS SMART THINGS LMAO
I love Marcus smart when he pulls this shit vs harden. Only time I want to see it.
Marcus Smart is soo cringeworthy
At least Marcus Smart survived unlike Jiraiya
marcus smart man 😳
LOL what a classic Marcus Smart moment
"as much as i hate KD, this Marcus Smart flopping is boring shit"
Marcus Smart is the best.
LETS GOOOOO THE OLD MARCUS SMART SPECIAL
MARCUS SMART DOES IT AGAIN
Marcus smart is a genius
I really hate Marcus smart but man he makes winning plays
"Marcus smart giveth, Marcus smart taketh away"
gonna need the celtics to lose just so marcus smart has less screen time
smart play by marcus to get the board
Marcus Smart stay winning 💪💪💪
After the deadline there was reports about how Danny made sure to let Marcus know that he wasn’t going anywhere and Smart stood up for the team’s management last night.
"THANK YOU.  I mean look all of your comments come with the benefit of hindsight but at the end of the day he sat on his hands with his warchest of assets and don't have anything to show for it.   Also not to shit on Kemba but once has to wonder if they took that max money and signed some cheaper, more complimentary pieces. Ricky Rubio went for 17M/year for example. You could've gotten him, a good sixth man and another complimentary guy for the price you paid Kemba. That would've also let to having more trade-able assets down the line because the Jays and Marcus Smart are more or less untouchable.  But if you were going to sign Kemba Walker and put yourself into a position where you can't effectively salary match (which doesn't go well with the fact that they had a warchest of draft picks and untouchable players) then the least you could've done over the past few years is draft older, more complimentary guys that were ready to contribute immediately next to your core.  Brandon Clarke, Matisse Thybulle, Desmond Bane - all players that Ainge either missed out on or literally traded away. Payton Pritchard was a solid pick, but Ainge should've doubled down on getting that type of player."
Marcus Smart for Aaron Gordon? There were a bunch of headlines like that.
"Which is not a good thing. Zarren is a smart dude but he's also Ainge's protege, which means Boston is going downhill, fast.  The entire house needs to be cleaned. Ainge, Zarren, Brad Stevens, Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, Kemba Walker, the training staff, every single one of them needs to go. Rebuild around Tatum and Robert Williams because they are the only people deserving to represent the Celtics uniform."
I don’t know why you’re saying this.  Maybe because when we get eliminated players tend not to have good games? Marcus Smart is the ultimate balls-to-the-wall elimination guy to have. Can’t recall how many times he saved us from elimination in the playoffs the last few years. Even last year he hit five straight threes against Toronto to help us win in the only way possible.  Smart is a fucking animal. Really don’t get what you guys are saying about him hurting us in elims. He was involved in some of the biggest plays to save the series in the last five years. Live by the smart die by the smart but the guy does not choke.
Probably Russ &amp; Marcus Smart
Tatum erupted for a 50 pt game on the same night Marcus Smart made some wild plays
"Sure! Keep Brown and Tatum, but resigning Fournier (who we used a massive TPE on) costs a lot in the tax. We’ll be in the tax next year, so starting Fournier at ~$10 million (Marks calls this conservative) gives a $19 million penalty. *If* the $5.9 million tax payer exemption is used, the tax would be $35 million. Now, we can avoid a harsh payment by dumping Tristan Thompson’s expiring contract (it’s $9.7 million), but it doesn’t say how to do this. Marcus Smart also has an expiring contract, but his theoretical extension would make him severely underpaid, so I, u/5WinsIn5Days, don’t think he’ll be extended, because the extension would be 4 years and $74.4 million, which Smart wouldn’t accept. He’s our longest-tenured player and one of Danny’s favorites, so I don’t see him leaving until the 2022 offseason. Surprisingly, the guys we picked in the 20s (Pritchard, the Williamses) look better than the guys we picked at 14 (Langford, Nesmith). It has a whole subsection of fluff on Kemba Walker that doesn’t say how to dump the contract, or if we should do it. We have second round picks in 2021, 2022, and 2026, and all of our future firsts."
"word. not sure what the rules are, but i feel like it's prob alright to post specific sections:  #The tradable contracts and assets  Once you remove Tatum and Brown from any trade dialogue, Ainge and his front office are looking at a mixed bag of trade options.  **Expiring contracts: Marcus Smart and Tristan Thompson**  Smart is the longest-tenured member of the Celtics' roster and Ainge has made it clear how valuable he is to the team.  ""Marcus plays as hard as anybody,"" Ainge said on ""Toucher and Rich"" after the trade deadline. ""He competes at a level that -- he's won playoff series for us with his, I wouldn't call it bravado, just with his intensity and his competitive spirit.""  Smart, who earned first-team All-Defensive honors in 2018-19 and 2019-20, is on an expiring $14.4 million contract, but is eligible for a contract extension. Boston or an acquiring team (six months after the trade) can add a total of four years and $74.4 million of new money. If there is no extension in place, Boston would have a decision to make with regard to the future of Smart.  Thompson is on a $9.7 million contract and could be a financial casualty if the Celtics sign Fournier. The 30-year-old averaged the second fewest minutes in his career (23.8), but still managed to put up 7.6 points and 8.1 rebounds. He had a +2.6 net rating in the 11 games in which he came off the bench.  **Recent draft picks: Robert Williams III, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford and Carsen Edwards**  Boston has five former first-round picks on rookie contracts, plus Edwards, who was a high second-round pick in 2019. While the Celtics' front office can be critiqued on their draft history, they have done a solid job drafting in the 20s, most notably the selections of Robert Williams (27 in 2018), Grant Williams (22 in 2019) and Payton Pritchard (26 in 2020).  Out of the six youngsters, Robert Williams III has the most value and upside of the group. He started 13 games in the regular season and is a candidate for an extension this offseason, making it unlikely that Boston would move him in a deal.  The jury is still out on their former lottery pick, Romeo Langford. Since the Celtics selected him No. 14 overall in 2019, the guard has spent more time on the inactive list as a result of injuries (and also COVID-19) than on the court. He has played in only 48 games his first two seasons, but did see considerable playing time in the playoffs in place of Jaylen Brown.  If there was a positive to a rather disappointing season, it is that Aaron Nesmith got better from the first time he stepped on the court until the end of the season. Nesmith averaged a season-high 9.2 points in May, shooting 55.9% from the field and 50% from 3.  **The former All-Star: Kemba Walker**  Walker still has $74 million left on his contract, including a $37.6 million player option for 2022-23 that he is all-but-certain to pick up.  Walker has averaged 20.4 and 19.2 points in his first two years in Boston, getting selected to the All-Star team in his first season. However, after missing six games in his final four years in Charlotte, Walker has missed 37 games over the past two seasons, and didn't play in back-to-backs this year.  According to ProFitX, Walker played $10 million below the actual value of his $34.4 million contract this year.  **The trade exceptions**  The Celtics were hard capped this past season, making it difficult for them to use their large, $28.5 million trade exception. However, starting Aug. 3, Boston will no longer have to operate below the apron, and will have three trade exceptions at its disposal to use: $11 million, $5.0 million and $4.8 million.  But like the case with re-signing Fournier or using its $5.9 million midlevel exception, there is an added cost associated as it relates to the luxury tax to acquiring a player via trade using the exceptions.  **The draft picks**  Despite trading four second-round picks as a part of the Gordon Hayward sign-and-trade and the March trade to acquire Fournier, the Celtics still have second-round picks in 2021, 2022 and 2026."
"Yeah, because Marcus Smart mostly shoots to keep the offense honest. In an ideal game he's not shooting much, but when they leave him wide open or there's a big open lane he has to take advantage.  Unfortunately, we're so busted up the last couple games we actually needed him to exert pressure and make things happen, and that's really not his strength"
Boston’s star duo is still insanely young though. In fact most of the roster is really young. Marcus Smart in his age-26 season is the 4th oldest guy on the whole team. That’s a major difference
When Marcus smart is your number two you are winning 1 out of five games because when he gets to shoot that much you’ll always get none game where he Hits like 12 3s.
"Nah, fuck that. I'm happy for Tatum. He legit did everything he could. Aside from game 2, he played 40 minutes every night, averaged 30 points, and scored through a ton of double teams.  When Marcus Smart is your number 2 scoring option, you aren't winning shit."
marcus smart taking 10 threes doesn't help
and lol?  It’s Marcus smart.  You either get 7/10 3P or 1/12 3P.  No in between.
Bruce Brown &gt; Marcus Smart
"Lol see you soon buddy, you Scrapped by Tatum and Marcus Smart."
bucks have players who play defense. Bucks aren’t going to be needing marcus smart to be their second leading scorer for half the series either.
As a Celtics fan 1000% agree. There is one person maybe two on the team that has true Celtic grit is Marcus Smart. Ditch the team except for him and Brown and start fresh. This group of boys isn’t going anywhere with Tatum as a pseudo leader
"Compazzo flops to the floor faster than Marcus Smart, which is saying something."
"cmon marcus smart, help ya man tatum. GET THIS W!"
The Marcus smart call now this one kyrie getting saved sheeeesh
Marcus Smart capping the year off with another signature shooting performance
[Thats a classic Marcus Smart move if ive ever seen one](https://i.imgur.com/eyJpKgL.jpg)
Heat check Marcus Smart
I honestly feel for Brad Stevens.  Ainge has given him a roster filled with rookies and a brain dead chucker in Marcus Smart.
If Marcus was smart...
Marcus Smart fucking up as usual
"you mean to tell me you think the Bucks have more firepower than this Celtics team where Marcus Smart is clearly the 2nd best offensive player?  The arrogance of y'all, smdh..."
* I hate these announcers * I hate these camera angles * I hate that they don't ever show replays  * I hate this series * I hate this year * I hate that I can't quit Marcus Smart
Marcus Smart really took 5 3s already
Why does Marcus Smart think he's Steph Curry.
Marcus status: not so smart
Damn Marcus Smart can't hit a shot to save his life
Marcus Smart=doodoo
Marcus Smart fills me with so much anger and I'm not even a Celtics fan
Marcus Smart smh
Marcus Smart is so ass
That’s just gonna make him stronger. More flexible knees = sharper ankle breakers. Marcus Smart gonna just stay on the floor the whole game and hopes he gets calls.
He averaged 20ppg in the ECF while being guarded by Marcus Smart.
"This is where things get interesting to me. The claim of hypocrisy seems to be ""KG says Kyrie shouldn't have stepped on the logo but he did disrespectful stuff all the time too"", but I read KG's post as more like ""If you step on a logo don't be mad(\\surprised) if someone throws a water bottle at you"", which isn't really hypocritical for someone that would step on a logo to say. Because history in other sports does show that if someone from the opposing team does that it frequently results in an actual fight between the players.   It's kind of hard for me to feel like Marcus Smart should be allowed to punch Kyrie, but if a fan throws a bottle he should go to jail for a year. Seems like KG basically feels the same. The legal construct for why fights are allowed in basketball is basically that getting punched is actually sort of part of the game even if it's not in the rules because it's common enough that players should know it's possible when they decide to participate. I would assume that would basically hold for this type of event where people have regularly been punched\\had stuff thrown at them for stomping on a logo. I'd rule not guilty if I was on the jury."
my perspective as a celtics fan is this. he shouldve done it during the game not after. he did it when no other celtics could retaliate - ie marcus smart. he intentionally tried to disrespect the franchise otherwise he wouldnt have done that
"Curry, Luka, Jokic, Marcus Smart"
Call me crazy but I think he's already better than smart. Granted I'm no fan of Marcus smart cause of his antics and flopping.
"We need to address the racial element in the room. These are entitled, rich, white people who believe they have the right to treat black athletes as less than human because they purchased a ticket. Because I haven't seen or heard any major incidents with Luka or Jokic. Dirk and Bird seemed to be universally loved by every fan base. I also don't think that it's a coincidence that it's happening more after a post-season focused on racial justice for Black Americans.   Every-time there is a major fan incident, it is case of a white person in an expensive seat treating black players like dog shit. Malice at the Palace. Marcus Smart. The dumbass hoe in Miami with her roid Husband and LeBron. Russell Westbrook. Trey Young. Kyrie.   I know heckling happens in every sport, but as someone that's attended hockey games in the first three rows and baseball games in every section imaginable including the  ""Diamond"" sections and boxes,  I can tell you it doesn't happen nearly as much and it's not nearly as intense and of course it's almost never racially based. This is probably getting downvoted, but it's the truth.   This sub was up in arms about Jeremy Lin getting called coronavirus. Why isn't it up in arms when black players get shat on, assaulted and get racial epithets hurled at themselves and their families on a regular basis?"
Marcus smart but better maybe I'd assume
"Have you heard of the story Marcus Smart retold about [the woman at the stoplight](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/marcus-smart-nba-boston-celtics-covid-racial-injustice)?  The relevant part: &gt; But the incident that has stuck with me the most, and that’s had the biggest impact on me, occurred a few years back after a victory at the Garden. &gt;  &gt; I was pulling out of the arena parking lot when I saw a white woman with her five- or six-year-old son crossing against the light right as the cars were starting to come at them. I had my windows down and realized something bad was about to happen, so I yelled to her, politely, that she needed to hurry and get out of the street so the two of them wouldn’t get hurt. &gt;  &gt; The woman was wearing an Isaiah Thomas number 4 Celts jersey. And there were all these other Celtics fans around who were at the game. I figured she’d be cool.   &gt;  &gt; Nope. &gt;  &gt; She swung her head around and it was…. &gt;  &gt; “F*** you, you f***ing n-word!!!!”  Some fans ARE so racist they'll ""tolerate"" black dudes on ""their"" team. Million dollar slaves."

Hmm."
Westbrook needs to embrace the Draymond/Marcus Smart role on the court. Just contribute to the team and limit how much you fuck up your team's offense as much as possible.
You got to have the perfect storm. Irate fanbase and players insane enough to not give a fuck.  There was a thread on this a few days ago. I can't think of a player as tapped as Ron Artest. Maybe Marcus Smart or Pat Bev.
i remember when marcus smart said that’s not really blake griffin over there when he started declining. that’s not the king. suns in 6
"You're not a player.  Taking massive offense to somebody stepping on the logo (that *always* gets stepped on because it's a basketball court) is dumb.  People wouldn't be mad if Marcus Smart was mad over it, not some random douche in a $3 Garnett jersey."
"Downvoting won't prove me wrong, you just realize you have no point.  I bet you were seething when people posted the article Marcus Smart wrote regarding racism in Boston after Kyrie's comments too 💀💀💀"
marcus smart would and has in college
Didn’t you read? Marcus Smart mins and “potential”.... 🙄
"&gt; Difference is that Marcus Smart is a significantly better shooter than Giannis  Well he is now, but over his first three years he was a 29% shooter from deep on 4 shots a game, but he kept shooting and has managed to haul his average up to a respectable 35% over the last three years.   Giannis on his career is a 29% three point shooter, and nothing is as good for your development as in-game reps. Even if he gets up close to 35% teams will still mostly duck under, but those are free points sitting there if he can improve."
Marcus Smart is a way better shooter than Giannis lol   Also he gets really hot like in Game 3 so u can’t let him heat up
"Man, if Thybulle gets a Marcus Smart or Mikal Bridges type of role, I swear... this guy will be DPOY multiple years. I see HOF potential with this guy."
Maybe he’s trying to go the Marcus smart route- still not a “good” shooter but everyone knows he’ll chuck it from anywhere so he demands way more attention and respect on the perimeter than he probably should

"His defense isn’t that amazing. Sometimes he just runs around.  This is pretty far off from past Celtics teams that used switchable, high iq vets to hold down the fort: guys like theis, hortford, Wanamaker, crowder, Bradley.  There’s a reason that the Celtics overhelp too much. Romeo isn’t good enough on D for Marcus smart to trust him to stay with his man.  I’d like to see where ainge goes this year because he’s generally been very good at the undervalued international/veteran player game, but imo Langford is not that guy."
"Something impactful? Smart and Brown both had very insightful articles last season that provocked actual discussion same with plenty of other players, Marcus Rashford has like a dozen different charities, Mike Conley did so much shit for Memphis.  Kyrie calling Boston some racist shithole in an interview during a playoff series does none of that. If he wanted to he has the power to reach people and spread an actual message"
"Tatum has clearly shown over now 4 years of playoffs that he can be himself in high stakes scenarios  As for the Knicks, I wouldn't feel too bad. You get guys like RJ real playoff minutes, guys like Marcus Smart and Terry Rozier (and even Jaylen) never missed the playoffs as prospects and got at least 20 min every year. I have to think that left a real impact."
"&gt;No it means he probably been around the team for years  Marcus Smart:  &gt;The woman was wearing an Isaiah Thomas number 4 Celts jersey. And there were all these other Celtics fans around who were at the game. I figured she’d be cool.  Nope. She swung her head around and it was….F*** you, you f***ing n-word!!!!”  So wearing a basketball jersey means you cant be racist? Interesting.  &gt;he is definitely racist because r/nba said so as we all know, throwing bottles on people is the first sign of hidden racism  Once again, no one is syaing he is definitely a racist.  We're saying that shouldn't be completely ruled out.  It could possibly be he's just a dickhead fan, but it could also be possibly racist.  Once again, if you have trouble reading, no one is saying he is **definitely racist**"
"He doesn't hate Marcus smart lol, he hates the franchise. It's fine to take jabs at each other you know. As long as nobody gets hurt."
Up there with Marcus smart for sure
Is Marcus smart fouled out?
"had to put Marcus Smart in his place lol. KD is the best player in the league, by far."
Marcus Smart down 20 and his bitch ass still has to talk shit.
LMAO Marcus Smart mad af. Cry
I would 100% put all my money on marcus smart if he and kevin durant fought.
Oh snap! Marcus Smart with the shooing hand to KD
"Pascal couldn't score on Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and Marcus Smart after not touching a basketball for 6 months  Julius is getting clamped by a 21st ranked defense led by Gallinari and Collins  Julius is far worse LMFAO"
Marcus smart
same with marcus smart and his beard.  brad should be fired just for that
Marcus Smart the type of player who would yell “at least it was close” as he misses his 10th consecutive shot.
Marcus Smart thinks he's the best player on the court
Marcus Smart low BBIQ taking quick threes from 30ft when C's are chasing the game. Coach Stevens needs to reign him in
"I want Marcus Smart. he plays with such tenacity, hits his shots, amazing defense, and gets calls with his solid flops. He probably gets no calls if he is on the Warriors though"
I’m pretty sure Marcus Smart wasn’t averaging 21/7/5
My dude he’s doing it to Marcus Smart..
That means Marcus smart &gt; Lillard. Dumbass logic siakam is a 6’7 trash can that spins every drive
Bro who knew Kyrie Durant and Harden may be a better big 3 than Tatum Grant Williams and Marcus smart
That guy on the Celtics with the headband (not marcus smart) flat out doesn’t know what he’s doing.  Mans just running around on defense. He must think it’s cardio.
Marcus smart would fuck up anyone on the Nets team
That’s not how you spell Marcus Smart
"If I ever get dementia the things I’ll remember are fortunate son by CCR, Deuce staring at an iPad while his dad put up an all time playoff performance, and the refs fucking Marcus Smart on that block earlier"
Marcus Smart needs accutane
Marcus Smart is saving Brad Stevens job
 Marcus smart turns into Steph Curry in the playoffs it’s insane
Marcus Smart fucking brings it in the playoffs
marcus smart has been hitting the wildest threes this whole series smh
Marcus Smart somehow winning this game by hitting 5 straight threes would be fucking hilarious
"We'll get to see Marcus ""Steph Curry"" Smart today"
Marcus smart is either about to go steph curry mode or shoot 3-17 from 3
"Going to be hard to unload Kemba's deal. As a wolves fan, I would love to deal Malik Beasley and assets for Marcus smart"
Interesting take. He's no Marcus smart.
"man ppl are acting like Herro is a scrub, the fucking recency bias in this sub is just ridiculous. Herro didn't even have a proper offseason to prepare for his 2nd season compared to the other guys. This guy scored 37 points in the ECF as a rookie while being guarded by Marcus Smart, who was and is still an All NBA Defensive player. He gonna prove the haters wrong next season smh."
Kemba walker is barely a starter and no were near his Hornet days. Tristan Thompson is a role player and no were near his 2016 cavs days. Fournier who? And Marcus smart is the heart and soul of the team but he’s still a role player. Tatum is the only star. Sorry
"I didn’t know Kemba, Marcus Smart, Fournier, and Thompson are G league caliber"
Draymond is literally Marcus smart(but much smarter in all aspects of the game) if he played power forward.
Rudy Gobert is unplayable in the playoffs.  Marcus Smart is a high IQ player
"He'd fit in like a glove with us. I've been begging for a pass first point guard, I don't want Marcus Smart starting and chucking 3s for an extended amount of time"
"Well, he can be if hes paid Marcus Smart money, not Joel Embid Money."
To put it into Celtics terms he’s a marcus smart caliber. Player getting jaylen brown caliber money
Marcus Smart straight up.
"He was isoing and taking more step backs than entire teams, he's an entire offense  But morons think ""flop"" is the way, nah Marcus Smart flops too and takes over 6 threes he doesn't draw shit"
Dude I love me some Marcus Smart but Marcus is just not as offensive capable as wiggins.
"I was going to drop something about ""so brave"" but c'mon man he's better than he was in Minny for sure, but he isn't in the Tobias Harris borderline acceptable second option good third option range. He's in the Marcus Smart great defender god awful offense range. He's Pat Bev with less offensive self awareness. Finally found a solid NBA role for sure, but if he's anything higher than your 4th option the team is in trouble."

Er it wasn't the stands exactly, I think it was like the closer seats behind the basket  Iirc the story was that the fan shouted some racist shit at Smart, so Marcus was totally justified imo"
You mixed Joe Harris and Marcus smart up lol
Marcus Smart
"I think it’s eerily similar to the Fultz situation. Really hard to establish the value of a guy with the yips. But similar to that situation, once moved, Fultz definitely showed some brilliant flashes. Just needed a change from Philly (and honestly who wouldn’t. Look what those monsters did to that hitchhiking robot).  Now, Simmons is still able to be FAR more effective than Fultz even when not shooting. So we’re not really talking apples to apples here. But having said that, if I’m Portland I’m sure not trading Dame to Philly for Ben Simmons.  It’s really a shame the trade with Houston last year didn’t work out. Would’ve made the East a lot more fun and balanced, and Simmons could’ve had a team of young guys to lead with zero expectations for success.  You have to think if he goes to Portland in a 1-1 type deal + picks, there will be a hell of a lot of pressure for him to perform near Dame’s level, which he isn’t capable of.  Sacramento is a better option for him TBH. Or I mean, I’ll throw Marcus Smart and Grant Williams plus a protected second in a deal to get him on my Celtics. I’m joking, but Darryl if you’re reading this, reach out to Brad and do that deal."
"Well the last time the DPOY was a guard it was the glove in 96 so prolly not Marcus smart. It could however be Draymond green averaging 10/8/7, and while no one should dispute that Draymond is an excellent player he really isn't a guy you want to supermax."
DPOY should not be qualified for a super max. MVP is the best player in the league and all nba first team is among the best 5 players in the league. DPOY could be a Marcus smart for goodness sake
The Marcus Smart special
Haha man that series was so fun to watch but that shit took years off my life too. Watching Marcus Smart turn into Ray Allen in those first 2 games had me ripping my hair out.
I wouldn't trade Marcus Smart for Ben Simmons straight up
"You’re not smart and that’s okay. Marcus Morris already publicly stated that Rich told him to take the 3 year $41 million contract from the Clippers because the Spurs could only offer him the MLE. This is known in the NBA that Rich Paul hates Leon Rose &amp; Leon Rose hates Rich Paul, Rich TRIES to keep his clients away from the Knicks &amp; Leon Rose TRIES to keep Klutch clients off the Knicks (made Mitchell Robinson &amp; Nerlens Noel leave Klutch &amp; released Alonzo Trier because he wouldn’t leave Klutch). Morris agreed to the San Antonio deal, backed out of it so Rich had to relieve himself of Morris’s representation so his relationship with the Spurs would stay strong because he has 3 clients on the Spurs still."
"Now he can be the 4th option behind Marcus Smart, much better."
"Wow, Lauri got paid. 2.5M less a year than Marcus Smart. Obviously different positions and way different players, but Lauri definitely has the injury prone tag, averaging 50 games a year the last 3 years.   To be fair his shooting splits last year are impressive: 48% FG, 40% 3pt and 83% FT, 13.6 points on 25 minutes   He's probably worth that much and it's not like Cleveland has any superstars coming their way, so might as well sign him while they have the money and try to convince their hopeful young studs to sign long term and develop into a good team.   But yeah, glad I'm not a Cleveland fan."

"Corey Brewer, Patrick Beverly, Marcus Smart."
"Patrick Beverly, Marcus Smart, Lowry, CP3, in that order. Though I don't think the gulf between Lowry and CP3 is as huge as some others make it out to be.  Also Chris Boucher, Brandon Ingram and Kevin Durant.  Also Cade Cunningham, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Luka Doncic."
"Please don’t remind me. I personally find that series more painful than Lebronto, at least in Cavs series it was the arguable GOAT dad-dicking us and not Marcus Fucking Smart."
"1) Marcus Smart attempts three point shots. Ben Simmons doesn't.  2) Marcus Smart attacks the rim. Playoff Ben Simmons doesn't.  3) Marcus Smart makes his goddamn freethrows. Ben Simmons doesn't.  4) Marcus Smart plays the game with proper intensity and focus. Ben Simmons doesn't.  Yeah, Ben Simmons is more naturally talented. He runs the fastbreak and the transition better. He rebounds better. But holy shit, there's no debate on who I prefer on my team in a playoff game.  Most of the Ben Simmons defendants claim we're all just reacting to a single playoff series. Guess what? If a player costs his own team so much it's perfectly reasonable for us to judge him on that and rank him significantly lower than we did before.  I never liked Ben Simmons. I was on Sixers threads talking about how they should trade him as early as 2019."
"AD’s situation was different as he was pushing his way specifically to the Lakers. There wasn’t a bidding war for him as it was clear he and Rich Paul were getting him to the Lakers. The fact they got what they got for him is still pretty good all things considered.   Because of his unique ability to shoot well and at high volume, KAT would be in demand and would fetch a Jaylen caliber player. Impossible to speculate until he’s on the trade block and when that happens on who’s available, but it’ll be easier for Boston fans to process the deal as if there isn’t no Jaylen there isn’t no KAT. This isn’t McHale and Ainge old buddies doing a deal, Rosas and Lore the new owner aren’t going to give KAT away for a Marcus Smart, Robert Williams and a bunch of non lotto firsts, no matter how many are included."

The best one I've heard is someone said Marcus Smart is who Beverly thinks he is and someone else commented that the full evolution of that is Beverly &gt; Smart &gt; Lowry &gt; CP3
"I've always thought Cleveland intentionally didn't grab a MCW, Oladipo, Zeller (some of the other top guys from that class) becuse they wanted to rebuild for another year and get a top player from the next class.   Such as Andrew Wiggins, Jabari Parker, Joel Embiid, Zach Lavine, Julius Randle, Aaron Gordon, Marcus Smart, Dante Exum etc.   I said it back then that the Cavs were trying to play a long game and have LeBron come back and try to coach up Kyrie and one of those guys since many of them are ""LeBron-Type"" players (Wing-fowards who can handle play post and guard multiple positions.)  They just so happened to get Bron back the next year and they drafted Andrew Wiggins, however they traded him away for Love almost immediately. But for a brief moment l felt like l was correct."
"&gt; NBA agent Rich Paul says he warned the Boston Celtics about trading for Anthony Davis for their own good.   &gt;Paul told ESPN’s Dave McMenamin — in a report Tuesday about how the All-NBA big man’s blockbuster deal from the New Orleans Pelicans to the Los Angeles Lakers went down — **that he tried to persuade other suiters, like the Celtics, against mortgaging their future for Davis.**  &gt; “The last thing you want to do is put a GM in a situation where he trades away an asset and then the guy walks out the door,” he said. “Like, you can’t do business that way. So it’s not really a hard conversation to have.”  &gt; Paul — who represents a number of high-profile stars, including Davis and his new Lakers teammate LeBron James — **had made it clear at the time that his 26-year-old client would likely leave in free agency next summer if the Celtics acquired him from the Pelicans.**  &gt;“I don’t think it stopped Danny Ainge from trying,” he told ESPN.  &gt;The Celtics had tried to compete with the Lakers’ trade offers last June and some fans urged the team to go all in for Davis, a franchise-caliber talent. Ainge has reportedly coveted the six-time All-Star for years. However, according to Paul, he ultimately “wasn’t willing to give up the young players.” While the Celtics were reportedly open to trading some combination of Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, or Marcus Smart, they weren’t willing to match the package of players and draft picks that the Lakers ultimately sent to the Pelicans for Davis — especially if he might leave Boston after one season.   &gt;“I don’t blame him,” Paul said. “I wouldn’t give them up either if the guy is not going to re-sign.”  &gt;Davis had narrowed his preferred destinations to the Lakers and the New York Knicks — and Paul pushed to make sure other teams knew that. **David Griffin, the Pelicans executive vice president of basketball operations, told ESPN that Paul “had done such an effective job of smoking out all of the competition” that the team realized they wouldn’t get a better deal than what had been offered by the Lakers.**  &gt;**In May, Paul told Sports Illustrated that the Celtics could trade for Davis, “but it’ll be for one year.” Shortly after Davis first requested a trade in February, his father also spoke out against the idea of his son playing for the Celtics, “after what they [had] done to Isaiah Thomas,” who was traded for Kyrie Irving while recovering from a hip injury he sustained during the 2017 playoffs, which derailed his career.**  &gt;Paul didn’t express opposition to the concept of Davis playing for the Celtics, but said he made the risk clear to the team.  &gt;“**If the Celtics traded for Anthony Davis, we would go there and we would abide by our contractual [obligations] and we would go into free agency in 2020,” he told SI. “I’ve stated that to them. But in the event that he decides to walk away and you give away assets? Don’t blame Rich Paul.”**  The 'Ainge has no loyalty' narrative was steaming hot at this time and the quote was used at the perfect time when Celtics seemed ready to finally pull the trigger on AD now that it was clear he wasn't staying in New Orleans. Just seems awfully coincidental."
Marcus Smart
TJ McConnel   Marcus Smart  Jrue Holiday  Extremly good defenders with a flawed offensive game that bring very good passing/playmaking and questionable shooting
I mean we definitely have a great defence this year. Not sure if I can say the same thing about the offence. Plus I think Jaylen Brown is tradable as long as Marcus Smart stays
Marcus Smart you get a phenomenal defender and willing scorer even if he's not great. Plus ultimate trust down the stretch

"&gt; the same people said the same things about Embiid in the 2014 draft. He had massive injury concerns, required surgery immediately, and many saw him as a big risk as a big man who’s body couldn’t hold up in the NBA  TBH I see Embiid still as an injury concern on a team nowadays (just like in 2014 draft) but even knowing that, I would have picked him #1.  The important missing context here, is that neither Wiggins, Jabari, Aaron Gordon, Marcus Smart, Julius Randle or LaVine in that draft were on the same level of KD to even have that kind of conversation. Wiggins was viewed at the time for the potential to be a good 2-way player, but I don't remember people talking about him as a super all-star like KD"
"I dont think neither Kings nor the pacers are breaking it up while I expect wizards to do so if Beal rejects the extension.That said I would like to see the kings trade Fox for simmons and play him at pf as a transitional handler like Giannis with shooting around him.A team with Haliburton, Hield, barnes, simmons and  Holmes with Mitchell and Bagley of the bench can be a playoff team with room for more growth with Haliburton having like Brogdon esque potential and Mitchell at least being a Marcus smart like piece with his defense alone with room to be more. The pacers, I think will move warren this year and run a line up of Duarte,Brogdon,levert,sabonis and turner which may well be a team in limbo like previous seasons magic lasts seasons wizards etc."
"Of the draft lottery picks only 3 have become All-Stars - 2 for the first time last season.  1. Andrew Wiggins   2. Jabari Parker   3. Joel Embiid   4. Aaron Gordon   5. Dante Exum   6. Marcus Smart   7. Julius Randle   8. Nik Stauskas   9. Noah Vonleh   10. Elfrid Payton   11. Doug McDermott   12. Dario Šarić   13. Zach LaVine   14. T. J. Warren  Of that lottery draft class who do you put above him? Obviously Embiid, LaVine, and Randle but thats pretty much it. Maybe a case could be made for Marcus Smart ... realistically I can't be consider him a bust if he is the 4th most successful player in the lottery."
Marcus smart is also a notorious flopper

"Marcus Smart or Jrue Holiday - but Smart is 27 and Holiday is 31, so the former is more likely."
"I fully admit that I’m Andre Robertson on 3s, but come on lol, this is like telling someone to follow through on their golf swing.  Obviously it can still help but it’s the default advice given to people, I was kinda hoping for something more unknown, like [that recent Marcus Smart video ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/p4szza/marcus_smart_shares_some_knowledge_on_how_to_get/)"
Marcus Smart
LeBron is one of the biggest. He's nowhere near Harden but he's definitely one of the biggest. So is Chris Paul. And Marcus Smart. They don't all share the number one spot. But they're the ones I think about when I think 'flopping'.
"hm. I'm a solid shooter, can sometimes playmaker and consider myself a good defender. Maybe Marcus Smart? My defensive tactics are more like Pat Bev tho (trying to get in the other guy's head. Subtle bumps and nudges, clapping in his face, talking a ton of shit, etc.)"
"im not biased at all but marcus smart.  other than that, maybe davion mitchell depending on how his defense translates to nba defenses, matisse maybe, there is probably s couple other guys im forgetting."
Marcus Smart. Not as frequent but his flops are the worst.
"If Marcus Smart is the one running the Celtics offense, youve got bigger problems than his defense"
Marcus Smart or Matisse Thybulle
&gt;3 point attempts is a much better indicator of how good someone is a shooting 3  what? so when Westbrook averaged 5 3s per game a couple years ago he's a good shooter? Or because Marcus Smart chucks a ton of 3s he's a good shooter? buuuullshit
couple things      1. I only watch NCAA because NBA is all isolations 2. Marcus Smart sucks 3. Andre Drummond is good
"Much more of a star than Dray is. Klay on his own team would be a Star still. Draymond on his own team would be a highly effective role player. A Marcus Smart type, Borderline all star, do it all type. But Klay on his own team would be even better. Draymond’s impact on the Warriors is significant. He’s insanely versatile and his vision is very underrated. He does things especially at the big man position that’s rare. But just because those qualities are rare doesn’t make him some transcendent star. He’s just a very good role player. A lot of people like to say he’s more than, and I think some of them are actually the causals. Some give valid reasons but people love to say Draymond is so great just so they can say “see how little of a casual I am, I don’t have the mainstream nba opinion!”"
Marcus Smart
Celtics: PG: Kyrie Irving; Isaiah Thomas; Kemba Walker  SG: Gordon Hayward; Marcus Smart  SF: Jaylen Brown  PF: Jayson Tatum  C: Al Horford
Celtics comeback vs Houston with Marcus Smart drawing 2 offensive fouls
"Rj, Randle, Quick, McBride, Fournier   Rj and Randle are obvious, Quick showed a lot in his rookie year, Fournier is a great scoring option and I think McBride could be Marcus Smart with a handle and three point shot. I doubt the team takes Mitch AND Noel so if they take one we go with the other. I’d miss Rose or kemba but u can’t protect them all. The other young guys like Obi, Grimes, Sims have decent potential but I def wouldn’t protect them out of the 5"
"A 5'11"" version of 2016 Marcus Smart minus the flopping"
"Yeah but in 2018 they went all the way to the conference finals and nearly knocked LeBron off with rookie Tatum, 2nd year JB, Rozier, Al and Marcus Morris.   Now slot Schroeder for Rozier, timelord for Morris, and they still have Marcus Smart. This is most definitely a team that could find itself in the finals if the dominoes fall right. It’s the nets and everyone else in the East and of that there’s about 4 teams that are all more or less the same. Can’t count Boston out you really can’t."
Don't forget Marcus smart is only 27.
Hell we would’ve won even with Siakam being ass if Marcus Smart didn’t turn into Steph Curry in game two. Dude buried like 6 bullshit threes in that game despite good defence all over him.
Marcus Smart 5 3’s in a row against the Raptors
"A large margin lmao. That's just not true and shows me YOU don't watch Rob play. No one ever scores a majority of their points off lobs. Also my fucking point is if you score 8ppg, there's no way you're a better lob threat, because you're definitely scoring less lobs than AD, a guy who scores 25ppg+. And I watch the games. My buddy is a Cs fan and we're always talking about Rob.  Maybe watch your own team lmao. There's a reason no one likes Celtics fans and it's cause you guys are fucking delusional. I wasn't even being a dick, but if you're gonna tell me I don't watch games, kindly fuck off. This is a prime example of someone sucking off a player because he's on their team. You probably think Marcus Smart is a sniper from 3 too."
[They already made one for Marcus Smart](https://www.google.com/search?q=obnoxious+celtic+guard&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj-qpznjsryAhXhMVkFHVIMDJAQ_AUoAnoECAEQBA&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=746#imgrc=rPxaeL0fShMAiM)
Marcus smart is used to matchup against wings and guards. So you can play him next to a defense deficient undersized guard like Boston has been doing for the past 8 years with IT/Kyrie/Kemba.   Mitchell is too small for wing matchups and cannot play that role
As good as Davion has looked he’s not on Fox’s level and likely wont ever be. His role on the team will likely be similar to how Marcus Smart has been used throughout his career.
OG should be higher. Marcus smart is a better defender than jrue holiday
"Doesn't really matter. There's no trade for them in the next two months, and I said it's a contract to facilitate a trade, not an asset to entice teams with. Marcus Smart wasn't in those trade talks because people thought that's what the other team would want, he was in those trade talks because teams have to roughly match salaries when trading (assuming both are near or over the cap, which functionally every team is), and the only non-max, non-minimum deal the Celtics had was Marcus Smart's contract. Now they have Richardson's deal, so if they need to get to $20m+ in salaries to make a trade, his deal helps that happen"
Marcus Smart
"That true shooting gap is pretty big. 62% is Dame/Kawhi/Shai/Kyrie efficiency, whereas 54% is Marcus Smart/LaMelo/Schroder/Ja Morant efficiency. The team with the 22ppg person is five points less, but has more than enough extra possessions to make up the difference and then some."
"He’s a UFA after this season.    The only way he gets traded is if he has made it clear he doesn’t want to stay in Washington.    And if he doesn’t want to stay in Washington, the wizards have no leverage.  There will not be a shortage of teams that could sign him into space. Including New Orleans.    If Beal is a free agent and has said he chooses Boston, of course Washington will trade him to Boston and it’s not going to take Jaylen Brown or Marcus Smart.   Horford, Richardson, Nesmith/Langford/RWIII/Pritchard and maybe a first would be the gist.   Washington has no leverage. Just like the Pels didn’t this year and only got a second and some expirings.   Because Lonzo could have just signed with the Knicks into space and left Nola with nothing.  Beal could sign in San Antonio or New Orleans or a few places and leave Washington with nothing"
Jrue's offensive game is at a Marcus Smart level tho and doesnt offer much scoring wise
"Marcus Smart. I think he's gonna prove a lot of people who think he's ""not a real point guard"" wrong this season"
Hmmph I guess that's fair. I see him as a slightly better Marcus Smart
Now they have a mid-sized contract that isn't Marcus Smart to facilitate a trade. Half the reason Smart was in so many Celtics rumors was that basically every conceivable trade needed his contract for salary matching.
"Marcus ""Stretch 6"" Smart"
"Celtics is gonna be different but it’s gonna be unpredictable. Coach Udoka is supposedly a defensive/team ball kind of coach which isn’t really how Brad rolled. Marcus Smart will be more of a playmaker and the additions of Richardson, Shroder, and the return of horiford makes it unpredictable"
Obviously bias but I think Marcus Smart could be in this conversation. Would be one of the shortest centers ever but he *can* guard the 5
"I think an offseason with the Bucks and his Team USA experience will further help his offensive production.   But to say he's bad or even Marcus Smart level offensively is stupid. He was excellent in the regular season but his percentages dropped in the playoffs as they do for everyone. For him, worse than many because he's playing such an exhaustingly high level of defense the whole game. His +/- tells the tale: he might not make as many shots as other PGs but he's taking points off the board for the opponent, which is just as valuable (if not more, given the psychological impact)."
"Jrue just averaged 17/9/6 in the playoffs and played some of the best guard defense we have seen for a championship team. Sign me up for that all day long. Put Marcus Smart on the Bucks instead of Holiday and the bucks struggle in the first round, lose to the nets, probably lose to the hawks, and lose to the Suns"
"Not going to argue too much for defence, but having a guard that can defend the likes of john collins, capela &amp; ayton, probably was key for a defence like Milwaukee’s.  I do wish he didn’t shoot as much, his awful shooting was likely a combination of fatigue from chasing booker/cp3 around screens + lack of team sets for him.  However to say that he is bad offensively, or that he is close to Marcus Smart is wrong IMO. Jrue Holiday is the primary playmaker of a championship team, just averaged a series high 9 assist in the finals with the best Ast/TO ratio against the Point God himself. CP3 wasn’t exactly surrounded by scrubs either. Bridges, Crowder, Booker, Ayton."
"But he's treated as more than a defensive specialist, people act like he's a 2 way star and call him a top 30 player. I just don't see how you can rate him that much higher than like Marcus Smart for instance."
Malik Monk - Monk   Marcus Smart - smart  Jrue Holiday - Holiday (mardigra)  Rodney Hood - Hood

If you have any links supporting the notion that the guys you mentioned have been publicly critical of Kyrie (not merely rumors or hearsay) then I will gladly admit I’m wrong.

"Marcus Smart versus Ray Allen, who wins"
It definitely was a flop but has the NBA was watched Marcus Smart play Basketball?
"I know what happened.  You met Marcus Smart, the greatest shooter to ever wear Green (statistically proven)."
"Hi Jayson,  What’s it like going to war with the GOAT (Marcus Smart) every night?   I’ll hang up and listen. Thanks"
"On a scale from 2 to 9, how much do you like Marcus Smart?"
Lol I love the Marcus Smart x Chipotle gags. He’s such a great teammate!
What’s your best Marcus Smart story?
Marcus Smart is beloved by Celtics fans because of his gritty playstyle and undeniable work ethic.  What has playing alongside Smart taught you throughout your NBA career?
"I think besides the stars, caris lavert, draymond(is he a star still?), and Marcus smart would be easiest."
You mean all-star and all-defense player Al Horford? 1st team all-defense Marcus Smart? And another lottery pick in Jaylen Brown? That roster?
"Smart and Kemba have shown their playmaking abilities, along with Jayson.  It is much more gameplan then no playmaker. Jayson is a good playmaker, but not from the point, which Brad has been trying him at recently. The only time the ball is in Kembas hands now is on a catch and shoot or spamming pick and rolls with Tristan Thompson and then just pulling it out.  Marcus has still been good in that aspect, the ball is just in his hands less now so he has less opportunities.  Jaylen is a terrible playmaker and continues forcing shots when he is off, completely icing everyone else out of the game.  Either Brad has no control of these players, or his gameplan is terrible, but either way he has to go."

Marcus Smart game 3 2017 ECF.  Cleveland had just beat Boston by like 70 combined points their two games in Boston and had swept the eastern conference up to that point. Smart was coming off one of the worst scoring seasons of all time scoring 11 points on .486 TS and 28% on threes.  Then in Cleveland for game 3 he goes 7/10 from 3 for 27 points 7 assists 5 rebounds and two steals leading the Celtics to a 3 point win.  They lost the other 4 games of the series by an average of 25 points.
"Marcus Smart got one during the playoff series against the Raptors last year. $5000, I think."
Darius Garland + Collin Sexton &gt;&gt;&gt; Kemba Walker + Marcus Smart
"First of all, the Hornets just played the game of their lives. 39 assists is extremely rare. Second of all, the Hornets are littered with irrationally confident shotmakers. They live and die by this frantic offense, that's why they look so good when it works. When it doesn't, they look horrendous. We simply don't have those types of players, Tatum and Brown can create but once they kick it out, it's tough to just go right back to driving when the next player they kick it out to is Marcus Smart or Grant Williams. We've played games where we've tried doing that and it doesn't work.  I'd implore you to go watch our 6 game winning streak last week before you just blindly use one game against CHA for an example of us needing to change our offense. When our team is engaged our offense is one of the best in the league, but that's on our team not Brad. At all."
Clearly haven't seen Marcus Smart one where he ends up parallel to the floor
"Just what the Nets needed, a Marcus Smart-type"
C'mon Marcus Smart be smart!
Marcus Smart and other players do the HBK kip-up sometimes
"Not really this Celtics team isn’t good outside of brown and Tatum and Tatum still isn’t at 100% post covid   Kemba is an inconsistent player, Marcus smart is bad on offense they have no interior guys and no depth. It’s really not a good team outside having two great young players in Tatum and brown"
He is the only reason we didn’t lose by 40. He single handedly held us in the game on the third and if they would have called the foul on Bridges at the end of the third he could have cut the lead to 6.   Marcus Smart was the only one of our main pieces that played well.
"Marcus ‘Machine Gun’ Smart is holding the Celtics back. He can’t shoot worth a damn, but he keeps firing anyway."
Marcus Smart was clearly fouled. bullshit
Seeing Marcus Smart argue to the ref about whatever after that 3 was funny as hell to me 😂😂😂
"Hey guys I just tuned in to watch my very first nba game, is Marcus Smart the best player in the league?"
"I think the most likely scenario wouldve been doing one of those stupid hypothetical trades i read about over the offseason to get a ""win now"" player,  like swapping picks with the Celtics for Marcus Smart, or something along those lines.  Maybe Oladipo"
"This is what a clown take looks like "" Kemba Walker, Jaylen Brown, and Marcus Smart aren't threats like Bogdanovic and Gobert are. "" like huh wtf u even talking about."
"How.   Celtics have a 30 ppg scorer, a 26 point per game scorer (who’s really a 28 ppg scorer when we take out the COVID month), a 25 point per game scorer, a 20 point per game scorer, another 20 point per game scorer on 60% true shooting (Fournier) off the bench, and a top 3 most impactful player in the league (according to WS/48) of the bench as well.   This is not to mention Tristan Thompson rebounding and Marcus fucking Smart who’s All Defensive 1st team."
"Embiid is good, but the players you have around him in that scenario aren't as good as the Jazz. I just think Luka would feast, although I feel he'd kinda overlap with Mitchell. Luka would probably play the point in that scenario, though.  Each player on that Jazz team is a threat. Kemba Walker, Jaylen Brown, and Marcus Smart aren't threats like Bogdanovic and Gobert are. Gobert's defense alone can win the Jazz games.  Utah is also just far too deep. Evan Fournier doesn't come close to Jordan Clarkson, in my opinion. Clarkson just fits that system they've got going on perfectly."
"Celtics depth is fine now (especially if we running an 8 man like the playoffs with Embiid)  Kemba Walker  Marcus Smart  Jaylen Brown  Jayson Tatum  Joel Embiid  Evan Fournier  Robert Williams III  Tristan Thompson  That’s 5 people averaging 20 with one averaging 30, another averaging 25, and another also averaging 25"
"Clearly watching Marcus Smart, that’s his go to move"
"Marcus Smart scoring champion it is, then"
I haven’t been but if Marcus Smart leaves ever his team will become my second favorite.
Marcus Smart fouled Tyler Hero on a full court shot at the start of the season.
MARCUS SMART
I fucking love Marcus Smart lol
"More like Marcus Not Smart, amirite?"
"I’m not saying that you won’t be 4 but man the Boston fanbase is so hot and cold it’s crazy.  Less than a month ago we wanted to fire brad stevens, trade Marcus smart and tank the season.  Now we’re gonna be the definite 4th season and sweep our first round matchup.  So wild."
How is this Marcus smart fault why tf is Fournier trying to post up and isn’t in the corner
"When Marcus Smart is your #2 option on offense, you know you have a problem. We can live with one of Kemba or Brown out, but *both?* Yikes."
That’s 1st team all defense Marcus smart to you
"That last part just isn’t true. When he is our second best player, he should be taking second best player shots.  Some games Marcus is on, some games he is off, but his defensive contributions and leadership outweighs that. We are nothing without Smart."
"How is it a troll, he is taking 17 shots and scoring 19 points lmao, and 2-10 on threes  He's a bad offensive player, don't understand why the Celtics loved to defend his offense bruh he's bad at it, even if every player is out  Marcus Smart should not be taking 17 shots ever, EVER"
"Put Marcus Smart in with those players, except unlike those he thinks he's Stephen Curry"
This game is basically a perfect example of the Marcus smart experience. And this pass is the cherry on top.
This game is basically a perfect example of the Marcus smart experience. And this pass is the cherry on top.

"&gt; Not sure about the rest of the team  I saw someone point out Marcus Smart is shooting more 3s, more efficiently than Tyler Herro, so not great I'd assume.  He's having a down year."
"Or as Marv Albert calls him, “Marcus Smart.”"
lol yeah but Marcus Smart also has experience guarding guys like Giannis too
"This, I can't stand any game called by doris. All she does is comment about x players and when she likes a player or a team, she'll talk about that over everything all fucking game long. No matter if said player or team is playing well. Probably doesn't help that she seems to hate the celtics but holy fuck. Then you either get Marv who can't tell who's who and is lost all game long. Smart passes to smart for the 3. Yes marv there's 2 marcus smart. The sad part is that all these national or specific network gets the exclusivity for the playoffs unless you live locally which you might get a few rounds of your local network. It's literally better to listen to the game on mute than listen to Doris or Marv. Such a sad state tbh.   Meanwhile the NFL has Tony Romo dropping knowledge bombs and predicting plays with his flawless understanding of the game. He's hyping both teams and mostly reacting to amazing plays and is super engaged about what is going on the field. I'm sure Tony has a shitload of cool stories or things to talk about but guess what, he doesn't, he talks and comments about the game.   Tbh, I'm mostly salty because I miss Heinsohn, he's our local guy and he meant everything to the celtics fanbase. Watching games without him and without the full capacity fanbase isn't the same. Oh well."
"No I meant we had 6'3"" Marcus Smart guarding Blake Griffin in the post during his prime. Not a rotation, as the matchup we wanted.   He's one of the strongest guards in the league and an expert at drawing offensive fouls so trying to back him down is like walking a tightrope. If you don't put your body into him he's not moving, if you get too physical he's drawing the foul."
"First half Marcus Smart is literally Steph Curry, and fourth quarter Marcus Smart is literally Ayesha Curry"
"You know how there's guys in the league that you hate, but you know if they played for your team you'd love them? Like Draymond Green or Marcus Smart?  Patty is not one of those guys lmao"
Tbf. Marcus smart is all nba level defensive player
Marcus Smart played well IMO
what the fuck marcus smart
If that was Marcus Smart this sub would be calling for his head
marcus smart - I GOT ALL BALL AND ARM AND FACE
"Marcus Smart had played well too, but I agree"
Marcus smart is the best PG on the Celtics
marcus smart is such a guy. looking over to see if KD is ok
Celtics are wasting a great Marcus Smart game.
Don't let anyone try to sell you on Marcus Smart being good.
The way Marcus Smart braided his hair makes it look like he has a giant bald spot almost as big as KD’s.
Marcus Smart coming down the court and taking over entire possessions without passing has got to be the most frustrating shit ever.
I’m dead at Marcus Smart trying to take over the game. This guy is gone this offseason
o/u on how many more contested 3’s Marcus Smart will take this game
Marcus Smart is so trash
If you're new to watching the Celtics they're about to let the Nets score 43 in the 3rd and then finally wake up in the 4th and make it just close enough where the game will be decided by Marcus Smart making a couple 3 pointers.
Where were you when r/nba finally realized marcus smart is the best basketball player to ever grace gods green earth
"if marcus smart makes 3 times as many 3's as the nets as a team, i think the celtics will win this series."
Marcus Smart? More like Marcus STOOPID [MLG airhorns like it’s 2015]
Marcus Smart is such an annoying player.
Marcus Smart has more 3s than Brooklyn combined lol
luckily for marcus smart KD only weighs about 43 pounds
marcus smart has no fear jesus christ
MARCUS SMART
Imagine thinking KYRIE Irving was better than marcus smart what
"So how much better is Jaylen than Marcus Smart in the starting lineup?    If rotations are cut down during the playoffs, Jaylen being out is obviously bad.. but Celtics wing depth is decent."
the only time i'll ever be OK with a bullshit Marcus Smart 3
Marcus Smart is a better shooter than KD
"Marcus ""Steph Curry"" Smart has arrived"
"Marcus Smart: ""THANK YOU"""

Marcus Smart Ass.
Marcus Smart is ass.
"Guys like Marcus Smart do fine, but I dont know what Ty Lue was thinking leaving Pat Bev and Zubac on an island with him."
"The reason why Draymond was so successful is that he knows how to keep in his role. He's not this bad in 15/16 and 16/17 as you saod but he's never making it into Harden level of offensive god and that's fine. He's successful because he takes his role well - which is to defend, playmaking as well as serve as the vocal leader.  I agree he needs to get his shooting back but phrasing it as 'expanding your game' assumes as if he was never good at it ever which, as you said, not true since he's proven it in 15/16 and 16/17. It's likely that those two seasons were statistical anomaly and will never likely to be replicated. It's not like he's not contributing offensively. Playmaking is still a part of offense.  When you have other scorers on your team - Oubre and Wiggins - I think Draymond should take less shots. Forcing him to be an offensive options makes the two of them obsolete, even more on Oubre.  Seriously, if he ever decides to be out of control and try to do more offensively, he's going to be seen as another Marcus Smart or Dillon Brooks (when he forces his shots)."
"""The flop never fails"" - The art of war, Marcus Smart"
Says a guy that has Marcus Smart on his team
Marcus Smart with prep time beats everyone in the NBACU
Solidarity from Marcus Smart fans. Brooks was fun as hell to watch these past two games
"Ohhhh yes yes yes with a prime al horford, jaylen brown and Marcus smart in the east! I mean teammates def had nothing to do with it! Oh let's add kemba for last year too, he's been playing with 2-3 other all stars his whole career buddy."
Marcus Smart on the list of non-Heat players I hope find their way to South Beach some day
"So here’s what I  Dort on offense doesn’t show anything that suggest he can be a 20-25 point scorer. He’s not quick off the dribble, he doesn’t have any major scoring moves, and he’s not explosive. He does show he can be a good 3 point shooter. Obviously all of this can change but this doesn’t suggest as a Marcus smart with a 3 who’s probably a borderline allstar"
top 10 should be all marcus smart lmao what a stupid list
Marcus Smart and Draymond Green
"Then what is? If the point isn't they should have selected someone who was more win now then what, they should have traded the pick for Marcus Smart or something?   That's soooooo stupid."
If Marcus Smart ain't number 1 this list is wrong.
Hey at least it's not a real person. He thought Aaron Nesmith was Marcus Smart multiple times.
There are floppers that deserves an oscar like marcus smart and there are peoeple that sells contacts
"*Marcus Smart with the beautiful cross-court dish to Nesmith, who takes a three*  (2 seconds later)  ""Marcus Smart for three!"""
"I’d say it depends what you get for him. If you are getting picks no players then they are probably a lower end playoff/play in team. If you could add a strong defensive wing (like a Marcus smart, OG Anunoby, etc.) they could be one of the best teams in the east.  This also all depends on how Warren looks coming off the injury. He looked like he could turn into a legit all star last year. I guess we’ll see"
Nah Celtics just defended him well (credit to Marcus Smart) and got some of the Wizards' best players in foul trouble early.
"He went the entirety of our game without realizing that Aaron Nesmith wasn't Marcus Smart, so my hopes aren't high"
I'm kinda shocked that Marv hasn't called anyone Marcus Smart yet.
"what would a team have to do to break this cycle?  Would they have to turn over literally the entire roster in free-agency in one off-season?  Like Marcus Smart&gt;Avery Bradley&gt;Rondo&gt;Paul Pierce&gt;Dana Barros&gt;Dee Brown&gt;Larry Bird&gt;Cedric Maxwell&gt;JoJo White&gt;John Havlicek&gt;Bob Cousy&gt;Sonny Hertzberg.  That takes you all the way back to 1949, before that the Celtics were in the BAA but we could keep going.  I don't think this is as uniques as you think it is..."
"I'm not your buddy, pal.  To most people it looks like he twisted his ankle and is heading to the bench. Marcus Smart just this week literally turned his ankle and had to be taken out of the game, and returned a quarter later.  Is it bad form to cheer even if you think a guy's just heading to the bench with a mild ankle twist? Yeah. Is it as evil as the media made it out to be? Not even close.  You watch it again, by the time it's clear he's heading to the locker room and not the bench (literally less than 60 seconds after he first falls down) the Raptors fans are cheering in support of him.  &gt;I'm absolutely certain that if it was a Paul George or Gordon Hayward or Jamal Murray type injury where they're clearly crying in pain that they would have quieted down almost immediately.  Do you disagree with this?"
**2 degrees between Larry Bird and Marcus Smart.**  (Bird--&gt;Tony Massenburg--&gt;Gerald Wallace--&gt;Smart)
Marcus Smart. would love that dude on my team
And now they're saying it was Marcus Smart
Marcus Smart flopping on Embiid a day after he complained about Embiid flopping too much
For some reason I think Marcus Smart should be in it. He has some of the best ones I can remember it legit feels like there is a sniper in the building. It's not easy to flop like that it takes athleticism and Marcus is making it into a form of art
"Nah, definitely the Marcus Smart 10/11 from three game"
"""marcus smart passes it to marcus smart who puts up the three... BANG OHHH Marcus Smart!!!"""
"Defense 1-on-1 is primarily positioning; where are you and your assignment on the floor, where and what does he struggle to shoot, and ultimately how can I make him uncomfortable and change from his regular shot form? Then it becomes more complex when other players are involved. Draymond does it almost perfectly everytime (like a bigger Marcus Smart who doesn’t shoot very well)"
Now they're saying it was Marcus Smart
Marcus Smart passes to Marcus Smart.
And all because Terry Rozier and Marcus Smart didn't want to pass to Jaylen Brown...
"Just saw my first live Marcus Smart ""Flop""  It gave me goosebumps. It was surreal. I have dreamt of this moment for the past 2 years watching highlights on youtube. I was jealous of everyone who had saw it live before. But now i am part of that group. Let me tell you it feels good. To any other new NBA fan who is striving to hear those words live. You will get there. Just stay focused. Your moment will come.  Thank you Marcus."
"""Marcus Smart with the 3""  -Marv"
"As a Celtics fan, I was reaaaally hoping to target him in a trade this summer. We really need a legit starting big who can keep Timelord healthy.  But it looks like this is out of the question now.  Maybe JJJ will be available tho? Memphis fans, any thoughts on this?   Boston needs a (spot) starting caliber PF and/or C this summer. I want Danny Ainge to target Kai Jones in the draft, buy we need another guy who can immediately step in as a starter or backup.   I've been pining for Val all year, thinking JJJ might be untouchable and Val was the more realistic target. I've also had my eye on SloMo and Justise. I wouldn't be opposed to Clarke or Tillman either.   On our end, we'd probably be offering up a package (pick 2) of: Marcus Smart, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Grant Williams, Tristan Thompson, possibly even Timelord in the right deal. What would it take to make it happen?  JJJ + Kyle or Val + Justise for - Smart + (Romeo/Nesmith/Grant/TT) and 2 FRP's sound fair?"
I thought that was Marcus smart. Someone how he always seems to fall down against air
Dillion brooks is the Marcus smart of the grizz
"Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown. Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris, Terry Rozier. Sounds like a pretty solid team to me. Except it wasn't, and we know exactly why, because only one of those guys is still a shitty teammate. And it just so happens he was supposed to be the one that held it all together."
"Eh - *way* more about positioning and team strategy than anything to do with hustle.    Marcus Smart hustles as much as anybody in the league, yet he only averages 3.5 rebounds over 35 minutes a night because *he's not supposed to get rebounds*.  When Marcus Smart gets a rebound, either he randomly happened to be in the right position, or something has gone wrong on the play.  When a shot goes up on offense, his ass is supposed to get back on D.  And on defense, he's more focused on locking somebody down and then getting into position to push the ball up court than to worry about rebounds.  There are obviously exceptions, and not every play goes to plan, but everybody on a court has a general role.  In the case of Westbrook, for whatever reason his org/coaches have always been totally cool with him just grabbing a dozen rebounds.  Well worth noting, his best seasons were all the ones where he *was not* averaging 10 rebounds."
"Yes he was overambitious on defense, but that's not sabotaging. He played a bad series, but do we also call Walkers playoffs last year sabotage? Lillards against New Orleans? No they just sucked, like Kyrie. Do you really think Marcus Smart would be cool with Kyrie, if he actively sabotaged the Celtics success? No, he just sucked like everybody else against the number one seat with the MVP who wrecked the whole league."
"love ben but i disagree so much with his list  just no way you can look at what Randle did and not think hes an allstar. who in his spot is getting New York to where theyre at this season? trae young got a worse record with a better supporting cast, KAT averages more points than wins, jamal was hella inconsistent through the first month, jrue never did what randles done even playing with AD, middleton was the third most valuable player on his team, draymond?? completely unserious and then you have him not even making the sub all star team like what? marcus smart is not better than randle nor is he better than lavine, vooch, russ, derozan or jaylen"
Because the ref didnt blow the whistle. Marcus Smart got hurt earlier in the game and the ref blew the play dead. Idk why it didnt happen this play.
Surprised this didn't get a real answer with the exception of u/scottishere's comment [below](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nfrd7j/terry_rozier_went_09_behind_the_arc_tonight/gynvu4p?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

Now they are saying there is only one Marcus Smart on the court
" The Celtics problems weren't solely on Kyrie,! It was a combo of Kyrie, bloated egos from the young guys and the rushing back of Gordon Hayward, who took minutes away from some of the young players, Kyrie is not a vocal leader, in the locker room, neither is KD or Steph they let their plays do the talking on the court, not everyone can be a leader like LeBron or-Draymond Green., James Harden.      Kyrie was the scapegoat and it’s obvious. Even now, The Celtics'' current leader on the team is Marcus Smart, instead of Tatum. Smart is extremely vocal in the locker room. Tatum is incredibly quiet. He, like all those players I mentioned, lets his play do most the talking."

Lmao you can’t just ignore the long racist history Boston has. Wasn’t it just like 2-3 years ago a fan was yelling the N word at Marcus Smart?
Now they're saying it was Marcus Smart

This record is so fucking useless the top comment is about Marcus Smart and Marv Albert
"Tbh it feels like Kemba does a better job on Kyrie than Smart, love Marcus but he can’t do shit in that matchup."
Why does anyone love Marcus smart?
"If we had Brown we might've actually have a chance tbf. I've said this before already that we (with jb) might be the worst matchup for them because the nets biggest advantage is spacing, forcing double teams and then passing to the open man because all 5 on the court can shoot. Since the celtics have a small ball center who's relatively quick, relatively tall and above average on defense wings with the 2 Jay's and finally marcus smart who can cover1-4 (maybe 5, depends on the player) we would've been in less of a disadvantage than other teams.  Well i guess it's pointless fantasy talk when we don't have jb, so nets in 5 just to piss em off"
surprised he didnt call him marcus smart since he was laying on the ground
"TBH I wouldn't want to double Tatum what with all that premium offensive talent out there on the floor with him.  I mean, are you really gonna send the guy that has to check noted sharpshooter Marcus Smart at Tatum?  Or leave the Jokic-esque Tristan Thompson open so you can send a help defender at the guy who's dropping 50?  That seems like a losing strategy..."
[Marcus Smart.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difg1ERWZfU)
Marcus Smart is not only the heart and soul of the team he's also every single player on the team.
Which Marcus Smart? There are so many of them
Marcus Smart has historically played him very well
"&gt; If you keep thinking your window is later you’re gonna reach a point where Tatum and browns deals are gonna be up and it’s not a lock the resign.   Our window isn't now because Tatum and Brown aren't good enough as players yet.   All you dumb Nets and Lakers fans who have an agenda against the Celtics like to create this faux state of urgency for the Celtics, when, if you actually fucking watched a Celtics game, you'd know that both players have a LONG way to go as players if they want to compete for a championship if they are the best players on the team. Neither of them know how to make anybody on their team better.   &gt; People aren’t clowning you for not trading for jrue they’re clowning you guys for having the best draft capital haul in history and not making a title contender with it  The 2018-19 Celtics had a starting 5 of Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Jayson Tatum, Al Horford and a bench of Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris, Aron Baynes.   That was the best 9-man rotation anybody in the NBA had that year. Vegas had us as favorites to make it out of the Eastern Conference.   Not Danny Ainge's fault that Gordon Hayward was a shell of himself after he broke his fucking leg and couldn't be the 2nd best player on the team like he was supposed to be."
marcus smart as a stunt double
Biggest name missing to me that stood out is Marcus Smart.  He played for US team a year or two and he makes more sense on the roster than half those names.  Team USA always has plenty of offensive firepower yet always desperately needs defenders.
" we would have had to gave up Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart . We didn't have the same team the Raps had also so you can't say we would have won, and the Spurs wanted a  proven player. Jaylen Brown just came off a great playoff run but didn't have the resum as Derozen and the Spurs probably would have still took the Derozan deal. Also in 2019-20 are roster would have been  garbage with both Kyrie and Kawhi leaving."
Yeah he was their Marcus Smart :'). Winning play after winning play
All you have to do is ask Marcus Smart.
"That isn't my point. Ainge is an average GM who got lucky with those two guys. Like I said, drafting is 70% scouting and 30% luck. Draft picks are NEVER sure things.  Ainge was never good at trading, ever. Let's not pretend he was. He also has made ONE in-season trade since like 2015 and that was a filler trade for a small salary dump. Ainge not going all-in while Tatum is on his rookie deal AND a 13m a year Marcus Smart on payroll may end up being the biggest mistake of the modern era Celtics. Kemba was the closest thing to going all-in and we all knew that wasn't moving the needle enough."
"Pat Bev has made 3 all Defensive teams, 1 more than Marcus Smart. Seems like he belongs just fine"
"so you're saying that every basketball fan should support their teams swapping for superstars just to chase rings instead of enjoying franchise players playing ball and doing well, even if it's not for a ring?  only one team can win a ring, i don't see why the celtics or anyone else should have to give up a great player who's locked in for four years just to get a two year superstar who might not even win them a ring.  like that's the thing - harden could have come to boston, with tatum and kemba, with marcus smart and theis, and he still wasn't guaranteed a ring."
"Tanking can also get you a guy who *helps* you get there even if he doesn't become an all-star. For example, the Warriors tanking to get Harrison Barnes who helped them win a chip, or the Celtics tanking to get Marcus Smart who helped them get to 3 ECFs (so far). I would also say Smart was the 2nd best player on the 2015 and 2016 squads even though he didn't start."
"&gt;Lowry, Marcus Smart, Chris Paul, Pat Bev  One of these is not like the others"
"I think they mean players like Lowry, Marcus Smart, Chris Paul, Pat Bev. are especially polarizing. When you play against them, they're floppers, they talk to the refs too much, they're too aggressive, etc.    But when they're on your team, you love those things because they're helping you win."
Would have been so much more perfect if she'd asked that about James Harden or Marcus Smart.
Marcus Smart is screaming in the shelter and there is a bunch of awwwing going on. Smart comes out saying “they're all so fucking cute!” Staff is cackling. Smart picked out a puppy and there is still laughing coming from the back room.
"My hot take, which might not be that hot, is that Marcus Smart is the single most important regular season player for the Celtics  JB/JT are obviously the better players but there is so much overlap between them and add in the intangibles that Smart brings to every last game"
"We, generally, like to play 3 wings with a ball handler and a big. That's when we've played our best basketball.   We are veeeery thin at the wings right now, it's the Jays and then nothing. Barnes would allow us to put less of a load on Jaylen and Jayson, who right now are being chucked out there and told to carry some lineups with barely-NBA level players every night.  Barnes would allow us to either have a quality player coming off the bench, or he can start and push Smart to the bench, both of which shore up the big issue in our rotation and provide a lot more flexibility.   With Marcus back, our guard rotation is fine. It only really looked dire because Kemba and Smart were both missing games at the same time. Our bigs aren't really a problem, either. They're more than serviceable. Having to get rid of Thompson to be able to take on Barnes will leave us pretty thing, there, though."
i don’t see him being moved unless a team is really willing to pay for it. Boston can’t afford him if they aren’t willing to party ways with a high draft pick and at least marcus smart.
I agree. People act like they need a dominant center because Embiid is amazing. But I just think they need people to slow him down. Thompson can do that and get boards while the rest of the team does their thing. Vooch would be awesome but I don’t know if Boston has a package for him that gets Orlando to trade him (maybe 3 firsts and Marcus Smart? I know Boston wouldn’t do that).   Barnes is awesome and can probably be had for 2 first round picks (you could even protect one of them I bet).
"Kevin Oconner who’s a huge Celtics homer was saying how they should wait and try and get someone better in the offseason with their trade exception. But who is going to come available that they can get for as cheap as Barnes?   Also Barnes is essentially a poor man’s Gordon Hayward. He’s big, versatile, unselfish, and can have big games. I’ve always thought Barnes has been misused. His best season was him running the pick and roll as the big with Deron Williams. He feasted on smaller mismatches. Now he’s an even better three point shooter hitting nearly 40% the last 3 years.  He wouldn’t push the Celtics over the top but they could get feisty with him and a healthy Marcus Smart/Kemba."
"&gt;I added up the average assists per game of the other four starters and the highest bench assists guy on the Suns, Celtics, and Bulls:  Not really a great way of doing it because it doesn't factor in the roles of the players you're actually looking at.  1. Marcus Smart assisting Robert Williams doesn't impact how Tatum plays the game 2. You're counting guys who haven't played half the games so far    &gt;4.6 from Kemba...6.1 from Marcus Smart   Your stat makes it look like we've had 2 PGs, we've only had 2 PGs for 5 games out of 36.   Marcus got hurt right as Kemba was coming back from injury. So you're counting these as two separate players but they should really only count as one aggregate player. It hasn't been Smart **and** Walker, it's been Smart **or** Walker.     &gt;Zach is putting up those numbers WITHOUT a true point guard.  And Tatum often runs his offence on his own. We use him in a similar way to how GSW used Durant. GSW would play to their system and then pull Curry/Klay and let KD carry the bench on his own.   We run Tatum + Bench a lot. It's been a running theme for our team for about 2-ish years now, Tatum's been the only star who can consistently carry our bench.    ***  A better way to find what you're looking for is to just look at assisted v unassisted shots [\(example link here\)](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1628369/shooting/).     Player| Assited FGM| Unassisted FGM| % Unassisted ---|---|----|--- Tatum| 103 | 176| 63.1 Booker| 126 |158| 55.6 LaVine| 136| 214| 61.1  Tatum is creating for himself at a higher rate than either of the other two."
"exactly, it just wouldn't work. I'd be interested in marcus Smart even with all our guards, but the Celtics would never do it. Kemba is the only way to make the finances work but the Spurs wouldn't do that. there's just no trade for the Spurs and celtics to me. Honestly though, I think I'd be open to a trade with the Kings centering around DeRozan and Barnes, if the Kings would be open to giving up more."
"Celtics- Tatum,Robert Williams and Marcus Smart. I think thats everyone that tested positive"
It’s a good comparison actually. Marcus Smart is not an atrocious defender. He’s very good in that area as well. Boston is not playing as well without Smart.
Facts.  I couldn’t believe I saw a thread debating who’s better between him &amp; Marcus Smart...
Probably Marcus Smart. And I don't really dislike the Celtics they're just our rival.
"That article has him fighting Gortat. In the months directly after he beefs with Brooks and Jeff Green and likely Oubre. Before all that Nene and Emeka Okafor.  On the court he 's tussled with Jae Crowder and Marcus Smart.  Goalposts. What do you want, a reacharound? What is it you want me to deliver? This conversation started about RW leading the league in techs since he's a hot headed dumbfuck but it's instead devolved into proving just how much of an ignoramus you are.   The original statement was that Russ never took the high road ever, never has, and continues not to as seen with his techs vs Wall and then getting tossed against Rondo. You're out to prove....what? That slandering Reggie Jackson as Wall did Gortat is ok? We've come far. Goalposts"
"Anybody who is saying Jrue is a better defender like what are you even talking about... Marcus Smart is a straight menace, is routinely a part of good defensive teams, and looks way better at defense through the eye test. Jrue had AD and they couldn’t finish as a top 10 defense.   Jrue is the better overall player but in terms of defense it’s absolutely Smart."
Marcus Smart
Well the person making the comment is Bill Simmons after all. He would take Marcus Smart over Lebron if he got the chance
"I love Vernon Maxwell, but he didn’t make a single all defense team. Harden has murdered Marcus Smart (an all-NBA defender) in three of their last 4 matchups."
Definitely Marcus Smart
"Marcus Smart, no bias."
Marcus Smart
Marcus Smart is who Pat Bev thinks he is
When they started fining they fined a ton of people then stopped. Now they give warnings or fine Marcus smart
"Smart does so many things that it's just assumed he can't possibly be good on offense. But, if Beverly wasn't the 'defender' that he is, he wouldn't have a roster spot in the league. Marcus smart offers more."
Marcus Smart is who Pat Bev thinks he is. LMAO
"Patrick Beverly? Marcus smart? Embiid? Lebron? I wonder who could be the winner. The amount of nominees is extensive… like every player that averages more than 12 a game. Lol flopping is a part of the game for now, deal with it"
Marcus Smart level flip. SHOUTOUT MARCUS SMART
"Bruh, Chris Paul flops more than Marcus Smart, my goodness"
"Pat Bev, PJ Tucker, and Marcus Smart. I hate watching guys hold, shove, hack, and do dirty plays just because they’re limited offensively or athletically. Work on your game and conditioning to improve but to just be out there occasionally hitting a three wide open and screaming after almost injuring everyone is nothing to be hype about."
"I don't dislike any franchise. In fact, one of my favorite profiles was profiling Marcus Smart of the Celtics. Really enjoyed that one."
And Marcus Smart
Not acl but remember when everyone thought Marcus Smart tore his Achilles this season vs the Lakers. Turned out to be a calf injury.
"""If the Clippers lose, would they take Romeo Langford, Marcus Smart, and Grant Williams for Paul George?"""
"And I’m saying the physicality of that era is greatly exaggerated   People take the best of that era, or the most physical, and act like it was every team every game.  It would be like saying every defender is Patrick Beverly or Marcus Smart in this era and saying this is how everyone played defense.  Or taking Steph and saying this is how everyone shoots threes"
"So just cuz I was bored I thought more about the roster. I can do Murray, Smart, Ingram, Crowder and Turner with JC/Schroeder + Ibaka off the bench. Or I could get creative and have Ingram run point, which he’s good at doing and go Ingram, Smart, Marcus Morris, Crowder and Turner or go with Ingram being the primary playmaker but have a lineup of KCP, Smart, Ingram, Crowder/Morris, Turner with Schroeder/JC and Ibaka off the bench.   That doesn’t seem like it’s enough to beat Beal and Russ? I think that’s a better roster than yours tbh. Great scoring and great defense"
Marcus Smart is that you?
"Not total turnover but after the 16-17 season, the Celtics got rid of everyone but Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Al Horford, and Jaylen Brown. Smart and Rozier were also the only guys left from the 15-16 team."
"Bro, if you think foul baiting is bad now? Imagine if the option to play a team that only has 4 players on the court is on the table? You’re going to do WHATEVER it takes to draw a flagrant to get that advantage. You think guys like CP3 and Harden and Trae game the system now?   Man, Marcus Smart would break his own arm intentionally for that. Then, you annihilate the team for multiple possessions. They can’t stop you on offense and you just double until they turn it over on the other end.  This is a hilariously bad idea."
"I 100% agree   Building a team is super hard   This thing I just did tho, that’s a playoff team, a damn good one.   You cannot do that with Ingram, he’s not good enough.   Replace Warren with Ingram, and Ben with Jonas valanciunas, Serge with a defensive guy like Marcus Smart   That team doesn’t make the playoffs   It’s much easier to build a playoff level team around a great defender   It’s easier to build a championship level team around a great scorer.   Ingram isn’t good enough to be the #1 guy on a playoff team.   Simmons doesn’t have to be that."
"Marcus Smart too. Hes given back a lot for the community, was also involved in the blm protests and as he said a few years ago he was in Dallas for a bit, off at college for a bit but this is his home, he’s a Bostonian, and “I love Boston and Boston loves me”.  Hopefully the fan reaction this year hasn’t changed that."
Marcus smart fan?
Marcus Smart: Udoka is a smart dude
"Imagine if Marcus smart had Donavan Mitchell’s scoring. Then pair him with two future superstars in Randle and rj and u got an unstoppable lineup. Then add certified buckets like Kemba Walker and drose Quickley and add in some defensive anchors like Mitchell Robinson nerlons Noel. That’s how u beat larden, DurSnake, and anti-vax Allen iverson"
We’re not talking about Marcus smart.
"Ainge made a lot of good moves and did everything logical, but his mistake was he didn't factor in the human element. Like putting out a comment that he never heard any problems with players experiencing racism in Boston even after Marcus Smart talked about his experiences of racism."
Marcus Smart
Marcus fucking Smart.
No Marcus Smart?
So like 1 year of Marcus smart…
"The defensive ability combined with the passive attitude is a very weird, unique mix. Usually elite defensive players have a visible drive and intensity and aggression to them (think Marcus Smart as a current example), whereas Simmons is just poker faced and seems kind of non-plussed by it all most of the time."
"Nah, people get unsustainably hot over similar sample sizes all the time. Over his first 30 games played in 2019, *Marcus Smart* shot 41% from three on 5.2 attempts. We all know KD's a fantastic three-point shooter, but *all* shooters have hot stretches and cold stretches."
"Those happen every so often for sure, and they're frustrating, but when you watch him day-in and day-out you realize they really don't matter that much. A bad shot here and there is part of the Marcus Smart experience, but people have this perception that he shoots us out of games, which is just straight-up false."
"Fair criticism of Marcus Smart: He's not an efficient offensive player. The guy's improved a lot as a three-point shooter, but he's still not *good*, and he also doesn't have the speed or touch to consistently drive to the rim, which is why he's only touched 40% from the field once in his career (and it was the season where he was taking the fewest shots by far). Not being an efficient scoring threat in any area really limits what he can do with the ball in his hands  Unfair criticism of Marcus Smart: He's a shot-chucker. Yeah, his efficiency sucks and he takes some annoying shots off the dribble sometimes, but he's never *taken* more than 11 shots a game in his career, and his shot rate goes *way* down when he's playing with the Jays. He's also a fantastic passer, which people seem to ignore for some reason— this is kind of a crude measure, but he's created more points off assists than he's taken field goal attempts every year since 2016.  ^(this comment brought to you by how sick i am of hearing ""marcus smart is a 2-guard, the celtics need a pass-first PG"" when marcus) *^(literally is a pass-first PG)*"
I heard Marcus Smart is wicked smaht at drawing these fouls
Marcus Smart
"Yeah. If we're picking semi-recent backup Bucks guards who specialized in defense, then DeAndre Liggins was probably better than GPII. But both of those choices to me are overvaluing on-ball, man-to-man pressure when it comes to defensive skillsets. I'd still rather take guys like Marcus Smart who can play good 1-on-1 but also make smart team defense plays (taking charges, timely doubles, communicating on switches, etc.)"
"I would never wish ill upon anyone.  However, Marcus Smart in this series can fuck riiiiight off. This plus the block on Powell on the final possession were painful. Amazing series, though, and credit where it's due.  I still kinda feel like there's Unfinished Business between the Raptors and Celtics, but our team has imploded and isn't really in a position to be picking ""rivals""."
"Man game 3, 4, 6 and 7 damn near killed me. Each time we looked like we were gonna go down and lose the series the guys somehow pulled us back in. Thought we were dead in the water down 6 in game 7 too. Came back and nearly tied it but this man Marcus Smart decided to kill us one more time."
just marcus smart things
"Jesus, man. It’s an absolutely fucking joke when you really start thinking about these numbers.   I have a good job. I’m building a house this year. I drive a new truck. And I save like 30% of my paycheck. I am very lucky and I’ve worked really hard. I won’t make in my lifetime what Marcus Smart *feels he should have made in addition* to his $77m in 4 years. In fact, I’ll likely never even sniff a total net worth plus lifetime gross salary close to that number.   It’s just ridiculous. For any dude to turn down a paycheck like Shroeder did is just lunacy, and for what? Your ego, that’s it. Good for Marcus Smart."
One of my teachers played against Marcus Smart one time
"Marcus Smart for a season, Rondo for the playoffs."
Marcus smart and semi ojeleye
"Yeah I was going to say I totally think Marcus could make $90m in this league. At least I’m sure he’d get an offer that beats the Cs. Really glad he decided to stay though and the risk as well as intangibles are definitely something to consider.  Besides, I’d be a-okay if the Celtics had paid him $100m. I’m one of those ‘rather lose with them than win without’ kinda fans. Especially Smart, because his capricious performance on the court means things like him knocking down five threes in a row to execute the Raptors leaves me with three stains on my khakis."
That makes Kyrie Black Widow?   Marcus Smart is Hawkeye?  Ben Simmons is fat Thor?
Marcus smart is the best bad shooter in the league
"He also won't be called on as much to score.  I get kind of pissed watching him jack up shots too, but I've come around to the idea that last year it was kind of necessary for him to do so.  Outside of Jaylen and Jayson, the only other players on the team to average 10+ per game were Kemba and Fournier, both of whom were missing for like half of the team's games and in Fournier's case only got to the team at the trade deadline.  Smart was the honest-to-God third option for large swaths of the season because the rest of the team was just that much worse.  Out of what we had available, you can really only make an argument that Pritchard should have gotten more shots.    This year, we'll have at least Jaylen, Jayson, Schroder, Richardson ahead of Marcus as options, and the rest of the role players, even though it's still not a super-deep roster, *should* be better than last year as well since the starting point was so bad.  Smart had a 56.8% TS% in 80 games the last time we had more than 4 competent offensive players, I really think the shot selection will improve this year if Ime can get everybody bought into a cohesive offensive system."
"Isaiah Austin more than a few times we ended up at the same camp on the same team like 3 teams, it was weird. Tons of college dudes I go on all day, I remember Rico Gathers was already 6’6 250 and chiseled when we were only 14. Only player I played against that wound up a good NBA player was Marcus Smart tho."
"Marcus Smart career TS: 50.6%  Duncan Robinson career TS: 65.1%  It's a massive difference in scoring efficiency. Obviously, Smart is a much better defender."
"&gt; ""better"" can't be objectively defined.  It can be subjectively defined and Marcus Smart is nearly unanimously subjectively better than Duncan Robinson"
Homer pick I think Marcus Smart can have a Lowry-like career arc.  This will be his first season as our primary ball handler and I think he’s going to surprise people.  Around the league I think Lonzo Ball is gonna be a guy that is a lot better in his late 20s than early 20s.
"Andre Iguodala  Marcus Smart  Seth Curry  Toni Kukoc  Draymond Green if he counts, Shaun Livingston otherwise"
FVV  Marcus Smart  Lu Dort  Mikal Bridges  OG Anunoby
Lol did you just call Marcus Smart an offensive threat?
"Rozier, Smart, Crowder, Morris, Baynes (2016-17 specifically)  Although I'd possibly take PJ Tucker over Marcus Morris and kill the Celtic trend."
"The best role players are plus defenders and can shoot the three when fed by the stars. Tucker did that with Harden at an insanely high level for years in Houston. Even at his current age, I am still putting him on my list. Mikal bridges looks to be one of the up and coming 3nD studs. Marcus smart is an elite defender, and honestly I’ll take his questionable shot selection because his defense simply makes up for it. Robert Covington needs to re-find his shot, but he is also the right archetype. Finally, I’m going to cheat a little and say OG Anunoby. Idk how much longer we will consider him a role player, but he is about as good as it gets for 3nD."
marcus smart  blake griffin  norman powell  mikal bridges  and lastly  #i want Iguodala
"Pat Bev, Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Grayson Allen, Nic Batum, Bobby Portis"
"Celtics   2011 - Norris Cole (Jajuan Johnson)   2012 - Fab Melo, John Jenkins (Jared Sullinger, Fab Melo)   2013 - Shabazz Muhammed (Kelly Olynyk)   2014 - Julius Randle, Tyler Ennis (Marcus Smart, James Young)   2015 - Rashad Vaugh, Chris McCullough ( Terry Rozier, RJ Hunter)   This is a very bad team. Makes Ainge look really good if you look at who was drafted immediately after."
2011 Enes Kanter - Tristan Thompson  2012 Kevin Murphy - Kostas Papanikolaou  2013 Shabazz Muhammad - Giannis Antetokounmpo  2014 Dante Exum - Marcus Smart  2015 Trey Lyles - Devin Booker   Just wtf
"Shit I will definitely eat Marcus Smart and we can distribute his property among us poors, if that's all we're discussing.  But I'm saying, money has a will of its own. I think if you could find a way to put yourself in Smart or Bezos or whoever's shoes, you'd choose money every time.   So the question is: is it really a choice?"
"This incident more than anything really highlights what you all kept trying to say, but was hard to grasp for us. He is not a winner.   If you saw that Marcus Smart quote, him being skeptical, but still getting it because he doesn’t want jeopardize the team; that’s a winning attitude. Wiggins is apathetic.   I really liked him, and I am super disappointed with the whole episode. I am still hoping that he will take the shot and save this season, but overall, I no longer see him as a long term warrior. He just isn’t a …. Winner."
"“my body my choice” when talking about a vaccine that greatly helps in preventing the transmission and impact of a communicable disease that is overloading hospitals in the midst of a pandemic is  once again  moronic.   And when it comes from someone with a public platform, damaging.   And round and round we fucking go. This isn’t about personal choice. It isn’t at all. Not even a little bit. And that you think this is some “online” thing says a lot. This is real life and it matters a hell of a lot more than some goofy sport.  And if you think I’m being harsh about Marcus Smart, you probably don’t want to know how I feel about Kyrie."
"Actually defensive stats make him look good, but like you said they’re notoriously bad.  He is covered on defense by Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum and they make him look good.  If you watch him, he loses his man, can’t get past screens, gets bullied even without a mismatch, doesn’t contest shots and doesn’t help well.  I’m not saying he’s a bad player, but he was a borderline all star at his best and was never a good defender, now he’s getting older."
"I literally typed in because of his free throws and because he jacked up more threes and you ignored the second part so you could argue.  He shows up as a decent defender on stats because he had Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum covering him lol.  He fails the eye test miserably.  He can’t contest shots and doesn’t make it around screens and is constantly bullied on ball.  Marreese Speights led the league in charges for us off the bench and he was an awful defender.  People who go out of their way to take charges do it because they can’t otherwise play meaningful defense."
"Marcus Smart said he is vaccinated partly because he ""didn't want to deal with the BS"" and because he didn't want his decision to adversely impact the team. But also said it's tough to be told what to do with your own body.      Smart on Celtics' struggles last year: ""We learned that we love each other. We did a lot of things together that most people didn't think that we did. But on the court, it was a different story. It just didn't click...You have to go out there and demand it and take it.""  &amp;#x200B;  please, where did he advocate AGAINST getting vaccinated?"
Marcus Smart Sometimes
Smart move Marcus!
"Marcus ""Not So"" Smart."
Marcus SMART
Why Marcus Smart always caping for Kyrie?
Marcus Smart is good at basketball
No matter what his fine is it won’t matter..he’s not hurting financially he’ll wait as long as it takes for a trade…and why shouldn’t he? The guy is getting it worse than anyone I’ve ever seen…as a Celtics fan I hope it gets worse and worse until it gets to the point where Marcus smart for Ben Simmons is a real option lmao…let’s keep the Ben hate going!!!
"Could have tried to work a sign and trade with Lowry or Lonzo involving CJ. Malcolm Brogdon, Dajaunte Murray, and Marcus Smart could all be available in CJ deals as well. I wouldnt say those players dont exist"
I always thought Marcus smart was going to be a star
"And the ""Marcus Smart"" flair..."
"(Sga)MCW, (dort)marcus smart, (giddey)joe ingles, (bazley)lamar odom, (poku)bol bol....  Hmmm????? Lol"
"Eh. Perk has bad hot takes and is made fun of, Marcus is smart, has good takes and is fun."
"We're not talking about a random b, lmao. Your experience is irrelevant to the conversation. Even more so if you're not a POC.....no offense of course.   &amp;nbsp;  We're talking about player experiences.   A team with fans who were so racist Bill Russell didn't even want to get his jersey retired publicly.   Kyrie came out and talked about his issues with the fans as well. So did Marcus Smart, Tristan Thompson, and I believe Jaylen Brown did as well."
"Bro I'm from a rugby country and 230 pounds at 6'3"" is a LOT bigger than Jrue. Marcus Smart is 225 and much bigger. Jrue looks around 210 to me. Another guy who was around the same height but big was Ron Baker at 6'3"" 220. But he had huge legs, long and big arms, and looked like an American football player build wise, with less external muscle mass. Jrue doesn't play in the nba at any more than 215 even when he looks big, smart probably plays at 225. Terrell Owens is way bigger build and muscle wise than Jrue. Jrue would have had to be way out of shape to hit 230"

"Marcus Smart, Davion Mitchell, and Ivica Zubac"
"Lol nah their assessment is a lot more accurate than yours. They might not treat him like an elite threat but they do treat him like a threat and no team outright ignores him and they never have.    In 2016-17 he averaged 28% on 3PA and the season before he averaged 25%:  * [Here are his offensive highlights for the season and you can clearly see he is being defended out on the perimeter.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtkIqLH6QvA)  * [Marcus Smart is the NBA's worst shooter, so why is he so crucial to the Celtics' offense? ](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/marcus-smart-shooting-percentage-stats-boston-celtics-vs-golden-state-warriors/)  * [Marcus Smart is a terrible shooter who's somehow essential to the Celtics' offense ](https://www.sbnation.com/2017/12/6/16739088/marcus-smart-shooting-stats-terrible-celtics-offense-works)  Now he shoots ~35% over the past couple years and it's not like teams have decided to stop defending him.  Marcus Smart having gravity even in his worst shooting years is very well established by this point."
Marcus Smart.  Love the way he plays.
After Marcus Smart tried the flop to get free throws on the other end 😂
I hate Marcus Smart more than words could ever possibly describe
EAT MY DICK MARCUS SMART
"Marcus Smart turns it over, Mavs score, Smart gets a steal on the next possession. Really sums him up tbh"
Better than Marcus smart lol
"Marcus Smart? I mean, I dont watch alot of Celtics but is he really as bad as CP3 and LeBron?"
This is very accurate. If this was Marcus smart he would roll out in a wheel chair and come back after half time.
"Lonzo was an amazing sport, by the way. Most players would have exploited that to make it look like much harsher than it was. I can't even imagine how Marcus Smart, or LeBron, or Chris Paul would have exaggerated. Credit to Lonzo. What a champ."
"Lonzo was an amazing sport, by the way. Most players would have exploited that to make it look like much harsher than it was. I can't even imagine how Marcus Smart, or LeBron, or Chris Paul would have exaggerated. Credit to Lonzo. What a champ."
Nah Marcus Smart gonna lock him up
Once they learn to start running the offense through the GOAT Marcus Smart
"Because kawhi fucked us over obscenely hard. Some other trade offers we got were Marcus smart and picks. Covington, Saric, and picks. Tobias Harris on a one year contract and one late lottery pick. There's wasn't even word that the blazers would offer McCollum."
Marcus Smart in shambles
Marcus Smart needs a word with him.
When is this sub going to take off their blinders to the fact that Edwards is another Marcus Smart who thinks he's good at shooting 3s and will chuck up 12 a game and miss most of them
Marcus Smart. Just kidding lol
Marcus Smart Jordan Poole MPJ Darius Garland Fred VanVleet
"Probably Smart’s tech from the bench, which is ironic because in the moment I thought it was more evidence of the Celtics unraveling.   From what I remember (and confirming with the play by play records) Jaylen missed a shot where everyone thought he was fouled. Smart yelled something, which resulted in a T.   Butler made the free throw to make it an 8 point game, and the Heat retained possession. They were plenty capable of making it a 5 point game right then. At that point, the Celtics hadn’t made a field goal in 5 minutes and only had two points off free throws in that span. Things could have got real dicey.   But Scal said something at that moment about how Marcus picking up a tech from the bench showed he was defending his teammates. Maybe that resonated with the guys. Schroder got a steal, took it all the way for a layup to make it a 10 point game, and they locked in."
We need Marcus Smart vs Jayson Tatum
"What Marcus Smart said you mean? He also said he is the answer to our offensive problems in the same statement While being one of the worst offensive starters in the league. Smart thinks he is a Hall of Famer but he is a career 36% shooter.  Tatum averages 8 potential assists a game this season, more than players like Jrue Holiday and Terry Rozier who are point guards. Even Brown averages 6 potential assists. They are 24 year old kids, obviously they still need to improve. Lebron didnt win until he was 27 , neither did Jordan or Giannis. Relax with the expectations for a team lead by 24 year olds"
If you consider naming a string a 5 plays and one of those involved Ben as throwing under the bus then sure. Just because Ben overreacted to the nth degree does not make a statement worse or better.  What Marcus smart said yesterday is 100x worse than anything embiid said or did but it's already old news because jaylen and Tatum aren't throwing a hissy fit.
"He's definitely been streaky.   When he's good he's game-changingly good. He led the league in 3P% for a month last season while also out-hustling Marcus Smart.  When he's bad, he pretty much forces his way into DNPs.  We're hoping he can stablise because he's got a lot of potential if he does.  Health hasn't been a huge factor outside of missing some time in college (and pre-draft), that's more Romeo Langford (who also had a nice night against Miami)."
Marcus Smart fixed the Celtics
"Marcus ""give me more shots even though I don't deserve them"" Smart is gonna lead a mutiny if the Celtics blow this lmao"
Did Marcus Smart just get a technical for cursing out Jaylen Brown?!?!?
"celtics blowing out a good team on the road and tatum has zero points.      marcus smart was right..."
if he would have missed an open 3 in between those plays we would have gotten the entire marcus smart experience in that sequence.
All that Marcus Smart sequence needed was a missed 3 and it would have been peak Smart
Think Marcus Smart just broke the backboard with that shot
Shoutout to Marcus Smart for not flopping on that screen.
we also saw Marcus smart brick wide open shots lol
Marcus smart 😂😂
Kevin O'Connor had a good take. He said the same way you hear how coaches loose the locker room he feels like Marcus Smart has lost the locker room.  I think for a guy who's whole thing is being the heart and soul of your team and being the guy who hypes you up that's a bad thing. He can't do his job if people start tuning him out
Jaylen: What Marcus said wasn't very Smart.
It took Brad and his team 7 games even though the Raptors’ best player through the season was playing like crap throughout the entire series. And even then you guys still would’ve lost if not for Marcus Smart randomly getting good at shooting in game 2.
"They'll get Marcus Smart, Robert Williams, and a bunch of high schoolers/middle schoolers and like it"
"The media release of Marcus Smart must play a role the electro shock. The talent is there, now we have to really play together."
"Lonzo - ""Marcus Smart Aint Got Nothing On Me... watch this..."""
"Guys who are great at on-ball steals like Butler, GP2 and Marcus Smart are so satisfying to watch"
Celtics meeting with Tatum and Brown was “intense” and “at one point Marcus Smart was crying” but everyone grew closer and a big lesson was learned
If Marcus Smart was given 25 shots he’d average 15
"Also as an aside Marcus Smart himself going into tonight's game was shooting an unbelievable 29.3% from the field(he ""helped"" that today by going 3 for 8)  He's also a career 37.5% shooter(44% on twos and 32% on threes)"
"shoutout to my boy marcus smart, hope he doesnt see this post."
"Marcus Smart kind of sucks now. He thinks he’s Jimmy Butler, fans treat him like he’s Alex Caruso, in reality he’s more like Keith Bogans."
TRADE MARCUS SMART FOR A REAL PG!
This is why you don't give a job to an unqualified person. Brad Stevens chose to let Fournier go to keep Marcus Smart for similar money. Moves like these can set a franchise back by years.
"Marcus Smart: ""You can't handle the truth!"""
"I mean part of the Marcus Smart value proposition that we're constantly sold is that he's this great leader and locker room catalyst because of his *hustle plays* and *drive to win*, but I mean...has that paid off at all?  Supposing our chemistry truly is even worse than before what effect is Marcus actually having as the locker room leader if the chemistry just gets worse every year?  Clearly not much.    If you check every story about Celtics drama the past few years, there's one player whose name finds its way into every single article, and it's Marcus Smart.  Marcus is the one throwing chairs around.  Marcus is the one shouting down Jaylen Brown.  Marcus is the one calling out the team's stars for not passing (after recording 0 assists, no less).  Sure he'll have games where he drills five straight 3 pointers in the fourth, but maybe you avoid needing him to do that if he didn't shoot 1-9 the rest of the game in the first place.  I have no doubt that he's competitive and wants to win, but that does not inherently make you someone a good leader.    I think any GM worth their salt would be looking to move Marcus at this point because something is clearly wrong with the formula and when you're trying to fix what you believe is a contender you start with the role players and not your established stars.  Unfortunately Brad hamstrung himself with the extension because now he can't be moved until the trade deadline with the CBA extend-and-trade restrictions, plus by setting the market price on him now it becomes wayyy more difficult to trade with any team valuing him under that $19 million per year figure."
Marcus smart taking 20 shots including at least 5 step back 3s a game  I need this
are you kidding me? jaylen brown is not on the same level. jaylen brown plus 3 firsts and marcus smart.
"fresh off the back of a players only meeting, and comments by marcus smart about passing, tatum's assists drop from 10 to 3 lol"
"hey brad, we hear you need a playmaker. we have just the man for you, 1st team all-defense point guard Eric Bledsoe. all we want is Marcus Smart, and you'll get to solve your locker room issues too. two birds with one stone, right? give me a call"
Marcus Smart needs to take over. Double his usage.
"Why give up a pick for Marcus Smart?   He brings instant heart and soul.  He's a great passer, according to Marcus Smart.  He's not afraid to take big shots."
"Come on man, give Marcus Smart some credit. Always getting underrated smh."
Why would we give up a pick for Marcus Smart
The Celtics deserve more hate for locking Marcus Smart into a big overpay.  4 yr/77M for one of the worst offensive players in the league who’s defence has been getting worse? What could go wrong?  Fuck the Celtics I’m glad they’re a laughing stock
"Killian Hayes, hes basically Marcus Smart but french"
"Good job Celtics. Now pass the ball to Marcus Smart, i think?"
"Marcus Smart is not a good leader no matter your score and Al Horford is a smart guy but has he ever been considered a ""leader?""  Veteran, absolutely, leader... no.  The issue is you guys play terribly selfish basketball, it's actually quite easy to see rather quickly."
"Somewhat I suppose, but still - 5.4 apg/25.9 ast% for Murray last year compared to 5.7 apg/23.6 ast% for Smart last year. And Murray's looked improved so far this year, but it's been 7 games.  Murray would help a little, as I do think his handles are better and is a more natural PG, but he shares some key similarities - both are poor shooters and all around scorers. Right now the Celtics problem is defense (which Murray wouldn't help, Smart is already elite), spacing (which Murray wouldn't help), playmaking (which Murray would help a little), and scoring (idk Murray does score a bit more, but even less efficiently than Marcus). It's a small upgrade at Murray's current play level, that doesn't really fix any of the Celtics issues.  Celtics can't trade Smart this year anyway, since they just extended him. But yeah Brogdon would fit so smoothly."
Jayson “Chucker” Tatum  Jaylen “Tunnel Vision” Brown  Marcus “Not” Smart
Brad is too hung up on Marcus and the fact that he hasn’t been moved before Jaylen and Jayson get trade talk is flabbergasting. I think Pop could have convinced on a Smart for Murray swap at some point but those days may be behind us.
"They role players definitely aren’t amazing but they’re solid. Marcus Smart trash start but he’s great defender, Al Horford leading league in blocks per game. Robert Williams solid, Josh Richardson solid, PP solid but needs more minutes. Shroeder has been good. I don’t expect this group of guys to win the Finals or anything but they’re better than they’re playing now"
"Im not saying they don’t, I mean the team looks like shit rn but if they were 5-2 everyone would be saying how great Al Horford and Marcus Smart have been as leaders. Also a brand new coach.  Moreso just saying it’s pretty difficult to tell what the issue is when we watch 8 hours of games a week and these guys spend every single day together"
"Hustle ≠ good defense, for how long people will mix up things, lol Smart is a good defender, but he is being paid as a defensive stopper... and he is really far from being a stopper. Yet another example of a overpaid athlete in this league, there is so many I lost count, no wonder most of them are all accommodated. On this regard, I give Marcus some credited because he is still trying hard, but still, his limited talent does not justify his salary/extension at all"
whos mini marcus smart
"Kristaps has never averaged 10 rebounds in his life, hes also 7'3 and cant rim protect, and he gets bullied in the post by Marcus Smart"
The nets have mini Marcus smart they vibing
"Obviously it's not Kobe/Shaq level but it is worrying that Marcus Smart is saying stuff in the media after 7 games. Additionally worrying that the team was so mediocre last year and appears to be on a path of repeating that mediocrity this year -- good point guard or no point guard. Two high scoring wings who can shoot from deep and defend should have more of an impact than the Jays seem to have. Yes the roster is imperfect, but you'd really think that they'd be better than they have been. Obviously it's a young season and this could all look silly, but if they underperform again and finish 7th or so, it might be time to ask more serious questions. I'd try to get a Lowry type being trading either or the Jays but still..."
Worse than having Marcus Smart call him out in the press?
Declining defense? Marcus Smart is one of the best hustle players in the league. Just because the team sucks as a whole doesn’t mean the extension isn’t warranted.
"Smart was never known for his offense. His defense (decline a bit but still pretty good) and playmaking is what make him good. The problem is he really not a PG, he in a role that not suited for him. Marcus is at his best as a secondary ball handler/sixth man.   &gt;I was honestly shocked they paid him.  It was either pay him or let walk for nothing. Smart is still a good player so paying him wasn't a problem, but I wouldn't had pulled the trigger that quick."
marcus smart more like marcus sucks
I wonder who is more in denial about their 3 point ability between AD and Marcus Smart
"If anyone on that team would say it to the media and definitely say it right to their teammates themselves, it’s Marcus Smart"
"Marcus Smart: ""That's why they need to pass the ball to us scrubs!"""
Herro cooked Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart in the NBA Eastern Conference finals  But he's playing against scrubs...
Marcus Smart sees what Draymond has on the warriors
"Trade idea:   Sixers get:   * Dame Lillard  Blazers get:   * Jaylen Brown  * Marcus Smart   * Tyrese Maxey  * Two Sixers 1sts  Celtics get:   * Ben Simmons  * Norman Powell  * Seth Curry  * One Sixers 1st  Sixers get their guy, run Dame/Milton/Green/Harris/Embiid  Blazers reset and remain competitive by running Smart/McCollum/Brown/RoCo/Nurkic   Celtics revamp and remain competitive by running Curry/Powell/Simmons/Tatum/Williams"
"Celtics fans were smug as fuck for years excusing every playoff meltdown as playing with “house money”. Unbelievably satisfying to see it become clear their two overrated “stars” don’t fit together/don’t even like each other and their lord and savior Danny Ainge fumbled 50,000 elite assets only to get stuck with Marcus Smart on a max extension and Josh fucking Richardson."
Lololol *sad Marcus Smart noises*

I don’t want you to get hit.’  &gt;“As soon as I said that, she looked at me – as she is wearing a No. 4, green with the white outline Celtics jersey – and told me, ‘F— you, you f—ing n—–.’ People that actually heard her were stunned. They’re like, ‘That’s Marcus Smart. You just got done watching the game, ma’am … with an Isaiah Thomas jersey on.’ ”"
"*Marcus Smart digs himself out of the dirt, rips a hole in his cocoon, and screams* ""They don't want to pass the ball!"" *before going back underground for another 17 days of hibernation*"
"You're still going to respect Horford and Marcus Smart. They're not Ben Simmons. More than anything you want the defense to have to respond to movement and exploit any communication errors, etc.  Not to mention Smart is a way better playmaker than Brown or Tatum."
"Non-Celtics-fans ITT commenting about how our only option is to trade Tatum to their team and blow it up and tank again are insane. Would you trade your 24 year old superstar just to “blow it up” and try for another pick? This is why you aren’t a GM.  The very obvious, glaring answer here is get rid of Marcus fucking smart. He is terrible and needs to be so far away from this team that I don’t even notice his frequent 1/13 shooting nights with 1 rebound, 2 assists, and 5 fouls.   Saying Tatum and Brown “can’t” play with each other is a bad take. This team has been so dysfunctional for so long and even still there is a new coach and a ton of new blood on the team. This year was never going to include a deep playoff run, anyone who felt otherwise just doesn’t understand basketball. The missing piece on this team is a PG who can actually act as a floor general, and a wing that can create offense when one of JT or JB is on the bench."
Have you seen the Celtics play? Marcus smart has a point…
"4/6 of those players are elite passers the other two are good.  JT and JB are pretty mediocre passers. The best at passing on the Celtics for the last years are Al Holford and Marcus Smart which have a low usage.  Even the stars PG’s in Kyrie and Kemba are more scoring focused.  Lastly JT/JB two-way defensive identity they had 2-3 years ago vanished, since last season advanced metrics show them as a defensive liability."
"I get ya. It’s not about motivating the team. It’s about venting your frustration and you never think you are gonna act like that until you become that frustrated and you become that frustrated when you feel like you are being treated poorly as a fan for a long period of time. Our guys aren’t fired up over bad losses like Draymond would be and Marcus Smart ain’t good enough to pull that and it has been a lot of passion-less excuses for a while now. The losses and bad play don’t seem to bother our guys and they seem pretty relaxed about it. So what do you do as a fan after that? If Jayson Tatum were as fired up about bad losses as he was about not getting calls when he isn’t finishing around the rim and come out the next game with a chip on his shoulder, there wouldn’t be a need to boo. But that currently isn’t happening in Boston."
"""Marcus wasn't Smart to say that"""
"You guys also have playmaking. Lonzo is a good playmaker and derozan sis underrated, really came out in San Antonio as he got rid of his tunnel vision   The Celtics don’t have this. Not to say they suck, but they have two score first wings and then Marcus smart at the one"
"Ainge put all his eggs in the jays basket after he lucked into them. Instead of trying to build a good team around them he just stockpiled players he thought would be good and just hoped it would work out and the jays would take us to the top  The roster construction gets worse and worse every year, legit no one one except the jays on this team can shoot besides a few young guys who udoka doesn’t play and horford kind of. Marcus smart should not be the third best player on any team, he just shouldn’t"
"As Tatum passes Marcus the ball in the 4th for a WIDE OPEN 3 and Smart bricks another one. Fuck Marcus Smart. He is a fucking terrible basketball player. The Celtics have plenty of problems, and so do Tatum and Brown, but Marcus Smart being your starting PG is problem number 1, 2 and 3."
"I don’t think he’s all that wrong. Maybe saying “a team disaster” is a little over the top, but Marcus smart really seems to think he’s the shit even tho he’s a above average player at best lol"
Hey at least we keep Marcus Smart
"Smart gotta go lol Hear me out  Yes, he’s right!  But when trying to build around young players you need a certain type of vet. The quiet enforcer or the bought-in vet. The worst scenario is the role player vet who doesn’t understand he’s a role player. Even worse when that vet has personality. Marcus smart isn’t good enough to publicly call out your cornerstones. It may be unfair but that’s how it goes   Young Mike Jordan wasn’t getting publicly called out by *Brad Sellers*  When Bron first got to Cleveland, certain players had to go. Ricky Davis was one. Too outspoken he probably woulda been on some Marcus smart.  Darius miles another. Google Darius miles’ reaction to lebron joining the team. Dude didn’t make it past training camp he was shipped   So yea there’s a certain insulation you do with young players. Bc you DONT split them up. Wing players have been able to do-existent for ages. Tatum and brown will be good they just need a true point guard. That’s literally it.   Draymond green is probably an example of outspoken vet who isn’t as good. He’s the exception. But he’s the only exception. Generally speaking, that formula doesn’t work"
marcus smart always been a lil bitch
"I understand the argument that he is making, but I agree with you on this one. The issue is not really the Jays (though they could do more to elevate their teammates, that needs to be a skill that they develop). The real issue is that Marcus Smart is the team's third best player and he's maybe the fifth or sixth best payer on a real contender. Then after him it is a massive drop off to guys who you might use very sparingly in a playoff series."
"This is Marcus maintaining his reputation as the 'heart and soul' of the team, that's why. Ironically his quote raises the question ,who should J&amp;J pass to? Marcus Smart?"
I don’t think I want Marcus Smart to shoot it though instead?
"donovan mitchell, ban adebayo, jamal murray, pascal siakam, myles turner, devin booker, marcus smart, jusuf nurkic, clint capela, cj mccollum, rudy gobert, damian lillaird, draymond green, kemba walker, klay thompson, and jimmy butler… are all players within the last 10 years drafted after the number 5 pick.   your point still stands but it also shows that you can get some pretty damn good - truly great players if you hit on your picks."
"Beal fits in the lineup. We’d have Romeo or Pritchard starting at point guard, Beal at SG, Brown at SF, Tatum at PF, and Al Horford at C assuming we trade Robert Williams and Marcus Smart plus other assets for Beal.   That lineup is star studded and maybe the best shooting lineup in the NBA with every player (if Pritchard starts) having great range. Defensively it wouldn’t be terrible either and it’d actually be pretty good on defense if Romeo becomes starter.   I understand concerns with fit but honestly I think it would fit nicely."
Patrick Beverley and Marcus Smart. They don’t usually score and they still manage to have the biggest mouths.
Nah. Starters - Fox/Haliburton. First guard off the bench - Mitchell. He has the potential to be the kings version of Marcus Smart.
"Their new lineup (if it stays) actually reminds me of your old days with IT, Marcus Smart, Avery Bradley all playing heavy minutes. Don’t think 3 guards is the right way to go personally."
"Maybe the Marcus Smart one from the bubble:  ""Marcus Smart is screaming in the Celtics locker room and there is a bunch of arguing going on. Smart comes out say “y’all on that bullshit!” Team is imploding. Smart is in bathroom and there is still screaming coming from locker room."""
"Well if you trot out a starting lineup that includes the 2 Jays AND PG13 AND Kawhi, plus either Marcus Smart or Zubac depending on if you are going big or small, the league would be truly fucked."
marcus smart with javonte green athleticism
If I’m interpreting it right I think it just depends on the situation. Brandon Boston almost certainly would have benefited from staying at UK another year. It kinda hurt Marcus Smart though. Generally I think if you can get the guaranteed contract by being a first round pick it’s worth going pro after 1 year and not having to go to class.
"you mean you're not excited about expiring Marcus Smart who may or may not be plateauing/declining athletically and chubby Tristan Thompson as a return for the franchise's greatest player?  I am shocked, positively shocked to hear this."
"Our backup is Delon Wright for 9 mil. He can be moved very easily in the offseason. Tho he’s solid, this is a move I think that sets us up for a trade and if he can be Marcus Smart who actually can shoot, he’ll be Fred Van Vleet hella fast and that’s a bonus. I might be the only Kings fan that’s wants to trade Fox for Simmons straight up as well so…"
"40/37 from a guard is not good, it's just not ""scream at Marcus Smart through the TV"" bad either. I'd be all for moving Smart, but it doesn't seem the team feels that way. Hard capping the team for Lonzo seems even less likely than moving Smart, in any case. I really don't think we're going to see any major moves like that from the Celtics this year, but we're gonna find out soon enough what the team thinks."
"That's why I'm saying it's bullshit. We just made the move to get out from under Kemba for ""financial flexibility"", so now we are gonna hard cap ourselves for Lonzo Ball? Does Lonzo make our roster better than any of the top 6? A backcourt of Lonzo and Marcus Smart is the key? I'm not sold on any of that, and I doubt the Celtics are either."
Dude I would have fucking loved a Marcus Smart level player
"Not re-signing Fournier would give us a backcourt of Lonzo Ball and Marcus Smart. TD Garden would sink into the earth with the amount of bricks being tossed around. Not only that, but I'll paste in something I wrote the other day about how critical it is for us to bring back Fournier:  * If we don't re-sign Fournier, then we literally wasted 2 2nds on 16 covid-limited games of Evan Fournier for no reason.  * If wasting 2 2nds doesn't bother you, then it also completely wastes the record TPE from Hayward, which we could have just saved for this offseason. We now only have slightly more than the MLE remaining, which will get us basically a MLE level player - Fournier is much better than that.  * Fournier ended the season with 17 PPG, making him the 4th best scorer on the team (3rd with Kemba gone). It can easily be argued that with a full season and increased role, he could replace Kemba's output by himself.  * Fournier is a natural off-ball 2 guard and has all the skills that come with that (cutting, quick decisions without needing to iso, quick shooting motion - all things we desperately need), and he shot 41% on 6.7 attempts from 3 last year which made him the best 3 point shooter on the roster.  * If we let Fournier walk, we will have essentially traded two 20 PPG scorers, capable of catching fire on any given night, for 35 year old Al Horford and...Josh Richardson? Reggie Bullock? Whoever it is, it's too much of an offensive drop off to handle.   Letting Fournier go would be a disastrous misfire and we have no real way to replace him."
"I think Suggs doesn't have the highest ceiling and would be a plug n play guy for us (basically just take Lowry's role), he's far better as a win now option. Tbh I'm just not very high on his potential and I can see him being more of a Marcus Smart level player."
Butler was the star of Baylor all year and has Dame potential. Mitchell has Marcus Smart potential
I have a premonition we are going to have a long discussion at the end of the careers between who is a better pick: Marcus Smart or Cade Cunningham
"Marcus smart then..... He’s either hot or cold but I bet 2/15 can go for 30 every night, and the defense would be pretty hard to match."
"Marcus Smart. Everyone making hustle plays, insane defense, good passing, above average shooting now, Nobody out hustling 15 marcus smarts"
You forget that Marcus Smart can start at the 1 and the 5. Simultaneously elite at both positions.
"Goes to Celtics for Marcus Smart, Payton Pritchard and some pieces/picks"
Marcus smart and a pick or 2 with some other bench piece...sure I'll take it lol
Well yeah Klay is much better. I was just naming another 3&amp;D SG.  I guess Marcus Smart is probably the closest comparison to Lonzo I can think of in terms of 3&amp;D talent.
"Jayson Tatum, Kevin love, Marcus smart, Richard Jefferson, iman Schimper…. I could list all of them"
"Brown is a *way* better on-ball defender than Beal, though. Like, it's not even comparable. I've been pretty critical of Brown's defense in the past, his ball-watching can be really frustrating at times, but he's arguably the best wing stopper on a team that has *Marcus Smart* on it."
"I will never like Pat Beverley, even if he is on my team. But for literally everyone else like that, yes. I don't like Marcus Smart, but would love him on my squad."
Saw mock drafts comparing Marcus Smart to D wade
"And im saying theres only one defensive first player being paid an elite salary, and a small handful of guys with moderate contracts like Marcus Smart. Even those guys are really still skilled offensive players but happen to be known for their defensive play. The majority of the money spent by NBA franchises go towards offensive play"
"Josh Richardson sucks. He's a worse version of Marcus Smart. If there is one thing I don't want to see on this year's Celtics team, it's two Marcus Smarts."
"Kawhi Leonard, Jrue Holiday, Jonathan Isaac, Marcus Smart, De,Aaron Fox and Paul George are all some of my favorite players. If you couldnt tell I enjoy watching good perimeter defense"
"Bagley, Delon Wright and #7 for Marcus Smart, Aaron Nesmith, and a future pick."
"Irving and Tatum - borderline superstars   Hayward, Horford and Brown - legitimate all stars   Stevens - top tier coach    Bench had Marcus Morris, Marcus Smart and Rozier   Not to mention incoming lottery picks from both Grizzlies and Kings. Outrageous and depressing to think about at that time as a Lakers fan."
"This OP is an absolute shit take. Marcus Smart is averaging 13/5/3 after 7 seasons in the NBA Oubre was giving you 15/6/1 after 7 seasons in the NBA Murray providing 15/7/5 in 4 seasons.  Simmons numbers alone are a notch better than those other players, he is a better defender, and offensively, creates more in transition than any of these guys. 24/25 years old is still so young, and both Simmons and Murray have missed full seasons. After 4 seasons Kawhi Leonard averaged 16/7/2.  This is the reason that Murray and Simmons are worth more. They both still have the potential to be the next Kawhi. Smart and Oubre will likely continue to be rotation players with similar production.  I think the Spurs would swap any two players on their current roster for Ben Simmons without too much thought."
"God damn you wrote a whole page of nonsense. Saying OG is more versatile on offense is exactly why this sub is so stupid. A guy who can only shoot is more versatile then a primary ball-handler(by the way a primary ball handler is a term used for guys who run the offense). There is way more versatility in someone who can run an offense and playmake.   Marcus smart cant run an offense that is why the Celtics need a real PG and if they try or have Smart be it, it will fail.   Anyway I shouldn't have wasted my time with an idiot who actually thinks a guy who can only spot up shoot is somehow more versatile offensively then a PG that can score and run an offense."
"Ben is not a second option on offense lol. He was supposed to be but since he hasn't grown at all, he is the third or fourth option now. OG is a perimeter player obviously he's going to have less attempts at the rim. Ben can't shoot outside of five feet so all his shots have to be at the rim. The fact that you don't know that is and you're still trying to act like you have any knowledge on the matter is just confounding. Being a ball handler or even the primary ball handler doesn't automatically make you the better player. OG is a lot more versatile and flexible on offense, if you take the ball out of Simmons hands he becomes useless. OG has come a long way as a ball handler and he's excellent off the ball. Simmons either has the ball in his hands or has to stand at the dunkers spot. You can't put Simmons outside of the paint because no defender respects him enough to stay close to him. Simmons is more one-dimensional than OG. OG is decent on the ball and excellent off the ball. Simmons is excellent on the ball (I'm being generous) and terrible off the ball.   &gt; stop overrating role players and acting like they are in the same tier as primary ball handlers  Primary ball handler is literally a role. It has nothing to do with how good of player you are in other areas. Marcus Smart was a primary ball handler for the Celtics, and not one person is going to say he ain't a role player. Jaylen Brown is not primary ball handler so are you trying to say that Smart is better than JB? You are just showing off your basketball ignorance. You should stop commenting cause every time you comment you just look dumber."
"If fiba rules come to the nba, guys like marcus smart and patrick beverly would be getting 5 year 100 mil deals, they’d be allowed to actually defend and expose guys like harden, steph, trae, and all that soft bullshit where you take a jumpshot and purposely jump into a defender for a foul would be gone. The nba is soft as fuck. The nba wont allow that because they are worried about putting “entertainment” on tv so anything that limits harden and steph from dropping 50 points every other night and shooting 20 3’s a game they would def not allow. If anything this has honestly opened up the game of basketball and is showing us that there are other leagues/countries where they play it the right way, i might actually start watching euro games"
"I would love fiba rules in the nba but i know the nba would literally despise that. The nba is worried about putting entertainment on tv, so anything that limits curry and harden from shooting 15 3’s a game and scoring 55 every other night they will not let slide. If the nba allowed fiba rules guys like marcus smart, Patrick beverly and andre robertson would literally beat up the “stars” of today. Shit they’d probably be getting 5 year 100mil deals easy. Damn the nba is so fucking soft."
"Watching the olympics has showed me 2 things, 1 the nba is soft as fuck, honestly the game has been ruined by that jumping into a defender while you shoot is a foul bullshit, as well as the physicality of the game, you literally see our guys dive into the fucking ground and prey for a foul as soon as the defender touches there shoulder or blows air into there ear, while the other countries dont do that dumb ass shit, they play through contact. Our guys are soft as fuck and the stars get babied, we’re watching what happens when basketball is officiated the right way and not in favor of superstars. 2 i think if the NBA adopted fiba rules it would make the game better but i know the nba wouldnt let that fly because they love offense, and if they allowed players to play like fiba allows them  then curry and harden wouldnt be dropping 50 point games every other night and would probably be getting beat up every game by guys like marcus smart and patrick beverly. The nba is soft as fuck. And i def understand what the old heads mean when they say that now."
What you don't want Marcus smart and CJ lmao
"Fair enough, I'd say the same about Marcus Smart. But fuck Pat Bev, I would never want him on the raptors."
"If he played on my team, I’d love him. I guess I thought everybody felt that way about him. Like in Boston, that guy is Marcus Smart. Jrue Holliday and PBev also come to mind."
It's about leverage too. Giannis has a insanely high center of gravity compared to Marcus Smart who is very strong and stout. Very hard to move without going too hard and making it awkward. It's easier for Jrue to move him as a strong and similarly built player.
"I'd like to see a backcourt of Luka and Marcus Smart. Then rounding up his starting five, maybe Mikal Bridges, PJ Washington, and Myles Turner."
"If some NBA guards, ie Marcus Smart, CP3  got fined 5k for every egregious flop in the past five years, I think they'd end up earning like 100k a season in total"
"Idk this is kind of subjective. If we are talking most important draft picks, Ainge “reaching” for Jaylen Brown at 3, and then trading back to get Tatum, is significantly more important than missing on late first round picks. People really overrate the average value of picks outside of the top 5-10- Kelly Olynyk was a great pick, so was Rozier, Marcus Smart was a great pick (weak draft), Avery Bradley also a good find way back when.  All of that being said, no matter how you slice it, other teams overall have drafted better given circumstances. Toronto comes to mind off the top- all of those guys are home grown/ drafted. GSW has also done very well, Heat seem to find some diamonds in the rough, I’m sure others I’m forgetting."
"maybe a Defensive End.  a 6'7 middle linebacker would be insanity lol.  6'7 at any position in the NFL really is kind of absurd outside of the line and maybe TE.  Marcus Smart is who I think of as someone who looks ""small"" in the NBA but would look huge in the NFL or at least on the bigger side if he were a LB."
There was a play from this season where Jrue just easily backs down Marcus Smart from the 3pt line to get a layup at the rim. Fucking Giannis struggles to move Marcus Smart and Jrue just bullied right through him. Guy is a unit.  Edit: found it. https://twitter.com/bucks/status/1374883854075396096?s=21
"They’d go harder solely because there would be less talent on the team.   Team USA is a collection of a superstars. When you have a bunch of superstars on a team, individual stars can’t shine as bright. KD for example on the Nets can drop 30 or 40 any given night. But on Team USA he’ll barely crack 20 because he has to share the ball with a bunch of other stars who also can drop 30 or 40 a night.   It’s similar with what happend to Golden State when KD joined. Before KD joined Steph was averaging 30, after he joined his scoring dropped to 25 a night. The more stars you have on a team, the less individually brilliant each will be.   The problem with Team USA right now is the fact that there’s a bunch of iso scorers but nobody willing to play a role or play team ball like a normal NBA team would have. Having someone like Marcus Smart would probably be better than having a guy like Lavine or Booker.   Past USA teams could make up for this because there was just such an overwhelming talent discrepancy between Team USA and the rest of the world. This Team USA doesn’t have that talent advantage."
"Right, I’m sure a roster with Derrick white, joe Harris, Marcus smart, Harrison Barnes and mason plumlee was the very best they could send. If the best players cared they would be there"
"So I just became a fan recently, about 5 years now. 2016-17 season was the first year I watched but 17-18 was the first year I watched games consistently. It wasn't actually a specific player (although I do love Marcus Smart) it was that whole team, the heart and hustle they showed. Down 15? 20? 25? not a problem. The grit that they all showed... That is bleeding green. To name one guy, it was probably scary Terry Rozier that playoff run."
Marcus smart wouldve been perfect for this team
"Great news for Wiz fans. We can now look forward to more delusional mock trade offers like Marcus Smart, a late 1st, and a game worn Antione Walker jersey for Beal.   Or Beal for Kyle Kuzma and some autographed Smush Parker kicks."
"Ever have a player you strongly disliked ~~join your team~~ on your team?  Yes, Marcus Smart."
This roster construction is ass.   Like what’s the point of Devin Booker when you already have a small army of dudes just like him but better.   Wouldn’t like a Marcus Smart be better for matchup purposes?
Lavine is treated like he is a defensive scrub that gets to run up and down play D and stand in the corner when attacking.  Treated like he is freaking Keith Bogans or Marcus Smart lmao. Thats on Pop.
lots of ppl couldnt buy a basket and Zach Lavine was treated like he is Marcus Smart or Keith Bogans. Thats on Pop.
Marcus Smart gonna have some real competition coming up
Jrue Holiday and Marcus Smart come to mind
"Amazing is incredibly generous. Hes a plus defender in specific matchups, but has also been cooked by like every top guard in the NBA. A player that has several matchups in his own position he cant handle, and is hunted on switches doesnt get the ""amazing"" nod, especially in a modern switch everything league.   Hes no Jrue or marcus smart."
"High IQ, multipositional defenders are so fun to watch for me. It's just always wild watching Draymond defend a whole fast break by himself, or watching Marcus Smart rip the ball from a dude six inches taller than him."
Donte is a Marcus Smart level defender minus the flops. People don't get that.
"I doubt it happens. Unless the Celtics are willing to give up Jaylen Brown and/or Marcus Smart, they would have one of the worst offers for Washington out of all the teams rumored to trade for Beal. And the Celtics would not win a championship even if they added Beal to this current Celtics team without giving up anyone."
Marcus Smart/Avery Bradley
"Langford, Pritchard and Marcus smart won’t get it done??"
"[ESPN] Does Jayson Tatum hate his teammates, Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart?"
"Marcus Smart, Kawhi Leonard, most good stealers   Theres Smart defensive highlights on timi's youtube page. Watch them."
"Lol except the Celtics package without Brown is still probably worse than other contenders “bad” packages. As a wizards fan, I’d take the Wiggins + #7 pick or Simmons or even Kuz+Schroeder+ a pick over…Marcus smart and Prichard??"
Same for me with Marcus Smart lol. Pretty sure it would be the opposite way if I were a Celtics fan if I’m being honest.
"Dame is an elite offensive player and if you pair him in the backcourt with Marcus Smart then his defense is no longer a big liability.   Dame, Smart, Fournier, Tatum, Williams/Horford  Looks like a championship level starting lineup if the Nets didn't exist. At the same time what are the chances the Nets stay healthy?"
"Beal had a higher usage % than Westbrook this season lol, what are you talking about. When Beal was scoring all those pts like 40, 44, 47, 60, his team was losing and they were headed to the lottery, but Westbrook's triple double explosion at the near end of the season pulled the Wizards to the 8th seed and not saying Beal didn't contribute but Beal only has to share the ball with Westbrook and Beal still had a higher usage rate. Meanwhile Brown had to share the ball with Kemba, Evan Fournier, Tatum, Marcus Smart."
"Man it’s too bad we can’t be friends. I’d take Marcus Smart and Tristian Thompson for anyone on our team not Lebron, KCP, or AD.  Even sign and trade with Shröeder."
"You are responding to a Sixers fan, the team with Embiid. Just a one way street huh?   Either way, that Celtics fan isn’t on the court flopping. He isn’t controlling Marcus Smart. He can talk about whatever he wants to talk about, especially considering the fact he was answering OPs question, providing something to the discussion, unlike you.  People who talk in r/nbacirclejerk shoukd just be auto banned from here, it would make this place so much better."
So is Marcus Smart
"I love Marcus Smart, but he's not a good scorer by any means. People talk about his shot selection, but that's not *really* the problem— he only takes those dumb shots when he needs to create for himself, like when our other shot creators are injured (like they were most of this season), and the *reason* he takes those dumb shots is because they're the only ones he *has*. He's not quick or strong enough to blow by his man off the dribble, so he ends up taking tough floaters or stepback threes, which are shots he can *create* but can't knock down reliably.  When Smart's our 4th option on offense, distributing the ball to the Jays and spotting up from 3, his offense is fine. Not *great,* but fine. The problem is that because of roster depletion and injuries the last couple of years, he's had to act like our 2nd or 3rd option a lot of the time, and he's just not that guy."
"Marcus Smart could go on this list too. Dude was compared to Dwyane Wade coming out of college, went 6th overall, and while he's had a solid career so far, his offensive game just hasn't really developed the way people thought it would."
Not if my name is Marcus Smart
"1. 2012 - AD and D-Lil almost do it alone. But just counting the guys listed there are 22 Allstar Appearances, 5 Rings, 1 DPOY award, amongst other thigns 2. 2018 - This is early but Luka and Trae are clearly two of the stars of the future, and to some degree the present. SGA and Ayton are also only scratching the surface.  3. 2014- Probably the two best centers in the league (And top the MVP finishers this year), a Breakout candidate in Randle and two solid if underrated guys in Gordan and Lavine. This was a deep draft that also had Marcus Smart, Capela, Boddanovic, Joe (And Gary!) Harris, and Jusuf Nurkic 4. 2011 - This class has accomplished a lot. Klay is one of the best shooters ever. Kawhi is the part-robot to dominate the league. This class is full of dudes who have aged out a little (it was 10 years ago), but Kanter, Tristan Thompson, Valanciunas and Iman Shumpert help teams. Tobias Harris still solid.  5. 1. 2019 - Another young but already great class. Zion and Ja bring the average up, but besides hunter and Herro already showing their value in the league, this class also has guys like RJ Barrett, Brandon Clarke, Darius Garland and Nikiel Alexander-Walker. This class may rise as years go on 6. 2016 - This one should probably be higher, but hey, im lazy and ive already moved thigns around. Simmons gets a lot of hate, but he is a good shooting coach away from being incredible. BI continues to improve each year. As does Jaylen Brown. Not to mention Jamal Murray, Malik Beasley and Caris Levert 7. 2017 - Tatum is elite. Mitchell is on his way there. people overlook Fox because he plays for the Kings, but he is still very good. And Bam is definitely in the top centers in the league. I still belive in Lonzo Ball. Is he Jason Kidd? No. Obviously. But he might be Rondo with a shot, and that is pretty special too (Cue my whole take being thrown out for Lonzo praise) Also John Collins 8. 2015 - This class is top heavy. But its a good top. Injuries and poor team management has hurt the careers of KAT, D-Russ, and Porzingas, but they are all incredibly talented and still dont reach the gym of this class in Devin Booker. The best guy in this class not named is probably Bobby Portis. So yea 9. 2013 - Giannis alone should probably raise this. But this class was rough. ANthony Bennett, Cody Zeller, and Alex Len in the top 5. Yuck. That said Rudy is also special. This class had plenty of guys good enough to be the 3rd best player on a contender. And plenty youve never heard of 10. 2020 - This class is hurt by small sample size. Lamelo and Ant def seem like they could be great. Few other guys are solid. This class will likely rise, but until I see more theyll need to earn it"
"The Warriors fucked up last season, they really had a chance to the WCF or even the Finals if they had traded Wiseman and not traded for Oubre (just removing those 2 they would have been a playoff team without playing the Play In). The next year would be harder but the West is still relatively open.  Whatever they do, I think they need more dept and someone than when Steph is sit could provide scoring. If I was their GM I will target Melo as a FA with the minimum and Otto Porter for a mid level exception. Also Boogie Cousins could be helpful for the RS (not much in the PO) and he already knows the team and if I remember correctly he was friends with some of the guys there.  Other players they may target are: DRose as Steph backup, Robin Lopez and James Johnson (to add some big bodies too).  If they manage to add some of those guys they then just really need to turn Wiseman+Wiggins in something good, but I will also consider just packing Wiseman and one of the picks for useful guys (maybe Marcus Smart?), in the end they already had star power, and it's probably better to add good specialist."
"Nesmith is a fucking player.  It took him 3/4 of an NBA season for the game to slow down enough for him, but it was clicking late season.  He's got that Marcus Smart hustle in him with superior size/athleticism, plus he shot 42% from deep in the last 20 games.  We'll see how the Celtics roster shapes up this offseason, but I do think he'll have a big role off the bench next year."
Marcus Smart routinely holds his own switching onto 4s and 5s
"you could join Celtics Nation, we got 17 rings but that's the past and also people get mad when I bring that up since they were won back in the day but anyway  currently we have one of the best young duos in the NBA, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Both 25+ PPG scorers with multiple playoff series wins under their belts. As well as these guys, you'll surely love rooting for   Marcus Smart, the heart &amp; Soul of the team who wears his heart on his sleeve and dives for every loose ball.   Al Horford, our steady veteran presence.   Payton Pritchard &amp; Aaron Nesmith, our two terrific sophomore players who can shoot the lights out and make tons of hustle plays    Rob ""Timelord"" Williams, he does cool dunks and blocks and it's awesome  Tacko Fall, he's 7'5 lol(or 228.6 cm)  as well as many other players such as Romeo Langford, Evan Fournier, Carsen Edwards, Grant Williams, Jesusemilore ""Semi"" Talibejesu Ojeleye, Tristan Thompson, Moses Brown, and so many more.   We also have fans who are super passionate about the game and even once cheered ""Let's Go Celtics!"" for 5 minutes even though we were down by 20 in a playoff game, because that is Celtic Pride.   I can fill you in more on the lore of the team if you want, there's a lot though, we're a very historic franchise"
"Anfernee Simons, 4 first round picks, and RoCo for Jaylen Brown and Marcus smart and 3 first round picks."
"You know what's up. I hopped on the Keldon train around January.   Started with a game against the Warriors right as Draymond was returning to his DPOY-level defense recovering from Covid. Keldon was struggling to hit any of his shots (but so was everyone else, Dray was on a mission that game) as it turned into a blowout. But of all the Spurs on the floor Keldon just kept competing like hell and stood out as the guy to worry about. Dray literally singled out and found Keldon every single time a shot went up to keep a body on him boxing out. It was a fucking battle. And a great example of what won't show on a stat sheet - iirc neither of them got a rebound when both were on the floor yet those two were the dudes actually controlling the boards.   So I watched the next several Spurs games and saw Big Body:  * Routinely make Luka and KP look silly and soft and turn Cauley-Stein into a rec league level player * Abuse Marcus Smart and Jaylen Brown... seriously he straight up sonned them * Bring a battle to the Nuggets that they couldn't fight. Had his way with Monte and Barton, then flat out exposed MPJ on the boards.   Plenty more examples of his flashes but it was then that I called my pops and said to ""remember the name Big Body, he's going to be a star in 3-5 years."" He didn't know who Big Body was, but when I told him the name Keldon he knew immediately and said he thought the exact same thing and maybe even become a star sooner.   &amp;#x200B;  Long story I know but I want it on the record now, wish I had put it on wax before he got the Olympic invite. Y'all Spurs fans got yourselves someone special there."
"He is like a way better Marcus smart, the comparison is actually pretty good"
Having a smaller defender on Giannis who is really good at positioning and taking charges is one of the better ways to defend him. Marcus Smart has done that as well.
"Horford, rookie Tatum, sophomore Brown, Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris"
It’s like Marcus Smart dude he goes absolutely nuts one game then the next you swear he’s throwing the game.
Marcus Smart on the Bucks would be a good fit for Donte DiVincenzo
"Man i feel like CP3 would be the most hated my type player in pickup.... always swiping at you, hitting the shit out of your arms and body and would call you a bitch for calling a foul... meanwhile he flops at any opportunity  Pat bev/marcus smart also fit this archetype. feel like im missing somebody obvious too"
"That fact that you said Terance mann hung 40 on his neck absolutely proves me point, that you do not watch the Jazz play. Again, scheme was to let them shoot 3s and guard the paint, which is exactly how Mann scored 40 lol.   *Gobert defended 1,335 shots this year, 184 more than anyone else. The 267 3-point shots he defended are the fourth most among 67 NBA Centers, and also more than Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Marcus Smart, OG Anunoby, and Kawhi Leonard. He’s defended the seventh most shots in isolation (78), and the most shots attempted on cuts to the basket (229). It’s safe to say Gobert puts himself out there in terms of guarding every player on every play more than anyone in the league.*  Here's one of the many articles you can find that show what you are saying is just blatantly wrong.  https://saltcityhoops.com/dispelling-myths-aroung-goberts-defense/  Homer or not, my point &gt; yours. lol"
And when you look at that draft it was pretty spotty that high:  1. Wiggins  2. Jabari Parker  3. Embiid  4. Aaron Gordon  5. Exum  6. Marcus Smart  7. Julius Randle  8. Stauskas  9. Vonleh  10. Elfrid Payton  Obviously Embiid is the best choice but I don't fault anybody for not wanting to gamble on him. After that Randle and Smart are the only other two guys really worth a damn and it took Randle awhile. Maybe Gordon with a full training camp and season with Denver. But the rest of it is pretty fucking yikes.  So ending up with Kevin Love and a title was a pretty good return.
"Yup, Sixers are doomed for not accepting a trade for Marcus Smart and Romeo Langford"
Im torn on Marcus Smart being the answer to this
"Daryl ego.. what? Lol fuck off, he wont accept marcus smart and rober willians for simmons, they couldnt even get aaron gordon with this package"
"Lmao what did the Celtics think the sixers were gonna ask for? Regardless of the hawks series, Simmons is still a 25 year old 3x all star and one of the best defensive players in the league, he may not be able to shoot but he still averages at least 14 points a game… Sixers aren’t giving him up for Marcus smart"
"Jaylen was probably low key a little upset the rumors weren’t true, i mean would you rather play with Embiid and a supporting cast of Maxey, Tobias, Niang, Curry, Korkmaz and Thybulle or stay with Tatum and Marcus smart lol… I’m ready for the downvotes 😮‍💨"
"He should guard 3rd/4th offensive option (not counting center) in other team, no matter what size. That's what we do with Luka. One night you guard 6'3 Marcus Smart, one night you guard 6'10 Marcus Morris. That's the advantage of 6'6-6'7 guy"
"I think Marcus Smart is, on balance, the best decision maker on the Celtics."
How about we give you Marcus Smart?  Better at 3s..
"Marcus ""NoT sO"" Smart with a great game today"
"Homer take but I'm buying Celtics stock. Classic 'buy low' situation and I'm not catching the knife either. Tatum isn't going to shoot 39.5/32.1/75.5 on the season, Marcus Smart isn't going to shoot 31.2/28.3/70.0 on the season either. It's been a relatively tough schedule with a new coach, everyone just has to settle down. You can see the true quality of the team in wins like the one against the Heat (17 point win against a quality team, on the road, on the 2nd night of a Florida back-to-back, hell yes)."
Lol Marcus smart must be so frustrating to watch sometimes if you want the Celtics to win games
Lol Marcus smart must be so frustrating to watch sometimes if you want the Celtics to win
"We're 24th in shot profile now. But part of the problem with shot profiles is they don't really account for the quality of the shooter. There's a big difference between an above the break 3 from Curry vs one from MArcus Smart.  Curry/Kork/Niang/Green are elite shooters, and Milton/Maxey are pretty good too. Clearly right now we're leaning heavily on that shooting ability which isn't sustainable, but when we're missing our best shot creators its hard to expect an elite shot profile. Our best players also take quite a few mid ranges Embiid is in the 98th percentile for mid range attempts, not to mention our FTR skyrockets +8.2%. Last year we were 26th in shot profile but still 13th in offence"
"Pacer fans don't want to trade him. Every other stupid BR report and lazy writer goes ""Who will help my team the most?"" and then zeroes in on Turner while not considering that every deal that is offered is a negative for the Pacers organization.  We either get trades to players that are skilled but ruin our cap or we get players that aren't going to help us improve and significantly destroy our team identity.  So yeah he's in demand but the Pacers pretty much have laughed at trade offers because they've all been ""We'll trade you Marcus Smart and 2 2nds for him!"" or something similar."
"In terms of ability, yes. However, take ability and price tag into account and I think he's right. The difference between Rubio's salary and DLo's salary is a Jordan Clarkson or a Derrick Rose or a Marcus Smart or a  Pat Bev.  Once you factor in DLo's 29.5m price tag and I'll take Rubio and Clarkson. I'll take Lonzo + Caruso. I'll take LaVine + Seth Curry. I'll take Murray and Rose."
Marcus Smart has been in rumors all the time in Boston.
I've been floating around a 3 teamer with Boston and Portland if Dame wants out.  Portland-Sabonis/filler/multiple 1sts/swaps Boston-Dame/Roco IND-Jalen Brown Marcus Smart  Hornets fans how would feel about a deal centered around Sabonis for Hayward and Bouknight?
Like Marcus Smart said defense is mostly about hustle.  We have Craig and Jackson who can take over some shot blocking if needed.  And you cant build a team around a non all star you are delusional.
"I begged the Celtics during the offseason to be the team that backslid the most. I do think a lack of a playmaker is hitting them hard.  Ricky Rubio would be a great fit on the team, but they're trying to see if Marcus Smart can be Ricky Rubio. Since Rubio himself is an expiring this season they'll probably wait to sign him during the offseason."
Cause they want the Timberwolves to trade them Kat for Grant Williams and Marcus Smart and 3 2nds
Jaylen Brown. I know it sounds crazy because he’s already all star level but I think he could be a superstar on a team that made him their definitive number 1. He can score just as well as Tatum with better defense and smarter shot selection. Everyone talks about Tatum 24/7 but I think Jaylen is his equal. If they can’t fix this team I’d like to see what he does on a team that lets him really shine. So many times he’s just on the wing watching Tatum do side step threes. He needs to be paired with a good playmaker+ shooters. They essentially play the same position (play style not height wise) that’s why their team is redundant and with the new and improved east they look like a bottom of the conference type team. I agree with Marcus Smart. They have to improve their playmaking or it won’t work. They cant just be iso wing scorers it makes the team so predictable.
"Everyone bullshits and God knows whose bullshit happens to catch on fire. Social media persons get famous by...introducing themselves as a famous social media person before they were even famous.   I have only seen people say Marcus Smart ""has a reputation of never backing down from anyone"". It is hogwash when you think about it because to really uphold that kind of reputation you have to go out on a limb and an eye with any motherfucker you come across and you will be eating out of a tube for the rest of your life in no time."
"Marcus Morris has made 72 mill so far and is owed another 33mill.  Markieff Morris has made 50mill and will probably earn like 5-10 more over the rest of his career.  They share a bank account but even if they didn’t it’s 2% of the damn near minimum deal he’s on. No I don’t think he gives a fuck about 50k or at least enough for him to stop.   *So if Jokic didn't retaliate, you really think the play was worth a suspension?*  Yes.   He’s a player with a history of doing dirty shit on the court, they’re in a blowout loss and he went after another player. It wasn’t a basketball play, it could’ve caused injury, and there was absolutely not reason to do it other than being a prick or instigating. Given his history and the fact that shit like that should be cracked down on he should be given a suspension and I’d make it multiple game to both send a message and to make sure the it costs more than the fine they levied.  There was no reason for him to do what he did. Jokic shouldn’t of escalated but the fact Morris felt comfortable doing that shit in the first place to the point he didn’t expect Jokic to do anything in return and clearly would never expect a suspension for it says a lot about the state of things.   What if he had injured Jokic doing that dumbass shit? The Nuggets season could’ve been potentially over cause the NBA is letting an idiot with a history of dirty shit get away with it. I think it would be smart to send a message in that regard, physicality is welcomed but targeting someone in the open court of a game you’re getting blown out in with unnecessary contact isn’t."
"I like Jimmy but the more he acts like this, I'm beginning to agree that he's all bark no bite. I remember that time he tried acting tough with Marcus Smart lol. I know Jimmy grew up in a rough situation, but Marcus ain't nobody to mess with either"
Marcus Smart shoved him lol.  Dudes just making things up for karma
Was Embiid suspended for shoving Marcus Smart? I don’t think so. What a joke
"It doesn’t matter that Curry is the best player when Boston gives up significantly more value. GSW still has Klay, Kuminga, Wisemen, Wiggins etc. they have a solid roster and with Tatum/Brown they’re stacked for years. Boston’s next best players are Marcus Smart and Al Horford, how the hell are Curry and Draymond coming there to win a chip before they start declining?"
Marcus smart and josh Richardson for Ben Simmons
"r/nba when no 90s basketball: 😡  r/nba when Pat Bev, Marcus Smart and the Morris twins: 😡"
"Kanter, the Morris’ twins, Olynek, Pat Bev, Marcus Smart, ain’t nobody shedding a tear if these dirty players get a taste of their own medicine"
"Marcus Smart has been good at this, I kinda wish he did it more"
Sounds good. I’ll call Daryl Morey and have him trade Simmons for Marcus Smart and Al Horford
"No, shams reported JB would have to be part of the deal. He didnt say Boston had ANY interest in that deal. It sounds like Brad called up and said how you like Marcus Smart and picks? And Morey said make it Jaylen Brown and picks and we got a deal!! .. Brad? .. Brad?.. i think he hung up"
"didn't really fuck with the heat until butler, I loved their run in the bubble. I don't think all heat fans excusing it obviously. Morris twins are like the pat Bev, Marcus smart, type players, you really hate them, but if they're on your team you kind of back them. regardless that shit was garbage and morris deserved it."
"if the Bill Simmons phone call was true, then Stevens is the bigger idiot there, not Morey.   BS: ""Hi, what's up with Ben?""  DM: ""Not much, who do you have to offer?""  BS: ""I can do Marcus Smart and Al 'Batross' Horford""   DM: ..."
The content is absolutely unreal: Ben Simmons drama Kyrie Irving drama Marcus smart drama Morris drama  Phoenix drama And it's only been 11 games of the season.
"Yep, I think you're right.  &gt;Smart is not eligible to be traded for roughly six months after inking his extension (depending on how the NBA treats this weird time-shifted summer). The Celtics probably need the early part of next season to figure out core pieces anyhow. The extension does take him out of the trade equation should a star-type player hit the market before January, but Boston has other means to construct deals. [Source](https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/marcus-smarts-extension-doesnt-box-celtics-fiscal-corner)"
not when the team is healthy but reallly should be starting over Smart he's a much better playmaker than Marcus.
Typical Celtics fan hating on the Lakers. What actually is corny is the Marcus Smart situation.
JFC this whole story is just click bait that’s probably four months old anyway. Chams is so clearly a Klutch guy and this is Rich Paul saying essentially:  “Well BOS was interested but only for Marcus Smart and 2 lightly protected picks. But ofc Daryl wanted JB”.   It’s a non-story.
"Well, as much as I love Marcus Smart and hate Ben Simmons, I would have to do that trade because of the talent upgrade.   Simmons + the Jays is a title contender, I believe that."
Don't forget their 3rd brother in Boston Smart Marcus.
"how would Celtics fans feel if they traded Marcus Smart, Josh Richardson, and a 1st for him? Not that the Sixers would accept, but just curious"
"Marcus Smart. Ill advise shots and generally bad offensive plays. He does hustle on defense though but it sucks to watch him play, you'll never know when he'll flip and turn into Marcus Dumb"
Celtics Secret Santa meeting was “intense” and “at one point Marcus Smart was crying” but everyone grew closer and a big lesson was learned
Marcus Smart wanted the whiskey because he knew about the karaoke machine. Whiskey is the only way to tolerate people singing that shouldn't be singing. My grandfather said something similar after one of my elementary school plays that my grandmother forced him to go to.
"[Sharania] Huge locker room turmoil early in the season: Marcus Smart said he got 12-year aged cheese in the Secret Santa exchange, but then it got stolen from him and he ended up with a Dance Dance Revolution set."
"For the thousandth time, Marcus Smart belongs up there.      So does Draymond and many other good defenders   So calm your tits b"
"""Per sources, Marcus Smart threw a bowl of soup at coach Brad Stevens"""
"""Marcus Smart is screaming in the #Celtics Secret Santa gift exchange and there is a bunch of arguing going on. Smart comes out say “y’all on that bullshit!” Team is imploding. Smart is in bathroom and there is still screaming coming from the gift exchange."""
"He asked me, if flopping is all i think about with Marcus Smart.   It is obvious he belong on this list. Calm down"
"Maybe I'm a bit too high on Fox in the late 30s, but he's an exciting young talent. I like to give young, exciting players that improve on a year-to-year basis the benefit of the doubt that they can get even better.  Realistically he's probably ""only"" top 50. Gordon Hayward, Malcolm Brogdon, Fred VanVleet, Mike Conley, Marcus Smart, Nikola Vucevic, Goran Dragic &amp; Co. would probably all be players you would rather have in a play-off series if it took place tomorrow."
Lol no Marcus Smart. Try again.
"Imo I'd disagree that he's a bad shooter. He's really streaky and takes a lotta tough shots tho, which tanks his percentages. Similar story with guys like Eric Gordon and Marcus smart"
Depends on the price.   For Marcus Smart? No.  For Romeo Langford? Sure.
"I like how Thibs continue to get shit on for this when:  Kerr: Curry, Klay, KD, Chriss, among others had surgery/season ending injuries under him just in the last 2-3 years.  Brad Stevens: Jaylen Brown wrist surgery, Kemba knee woes, and didn’t Marcus Smart miss a big chunk of the season this past year?  Steve Nash: Already has three stars that can barely play a 60-70% of a season. And this is his first year as a HC.  Mike D’Antoni: Had Amare, Chandler in their primes, and didn’t he try coach that hobbled Lakers team with Kobe Dwight and Nash? I guess he’s to blame for all their injuries too?  I can go on if you want me to knit pick."
Nope but the 36-40ers would be an elite defensive group   36 Marcus smart 37 MetaWorld Peace  38 kwayne brown  39 Dwight Howard 40 Shawn Kemp
Marcus Smart?
"I agree. He's a Player who fills a certain Role. I think we should come up with a term like ""Role Player"" to describe Marcus Smart and stop treating him as more than that."
I might take an open shot from Marcus Smart if the shot clock is still on but about to expire. Dude is money when it’s late in the shot clock.
I trust Marcus Smart to make that open three in the biggest moments. Id let Al Horford Take it too no problem.
"Evan fournier is a legit player and would be the 3rd best scoring option in Boston. You are acting like if Celtics signed him for the same deal, they wouldnt be able to trade him. 3 years deal with 1 year team option, plays out 1st year and then there are 2 years left. He is very easily moveable.  Players similar to fournier or worse got similar contracts to him. Celtics gonna be shocked when they see that their team isnt gonna go anywhere with marcus smart being their 3rd best option"
"Trade our most promising youth (Rui, Deni, Gafford) for veteran help for Beal. Theh Beal requests a trade. We end up with a bunch of 3rd tier starters who can't win, but we're already too deep into the season to tank.  We get the 6th overall pick, no Beal, no Deni, no Rui, and our next 3 seasons will be driven by like... Marcus Smart caliber dudes.  No disrespect to Marcus Smart, who is a good player, he's just not the kind of guy you have leading a team."
"Players get overpaid in free agency every year though, what makes you think the same thing won't happen with Robert Williams next year? Will teams take it easy on Boston cause they've lost so many guys in recent years? Your response is exactly my point: if he gets a big offer sheet, I doubt Boston matches it. The same is probably going to be true with Marcus Smart when he hits free agency next summer: someone will make him a large offer and the Celtics will pass on matching it."
Available for a Sign and Trade for Marcus Smart!
You can't count on him in a big game. That really hurts his value. You just never know when it will flare up and he goes 3-17. I don't see how a playoff team can count on him. Better have a good backup. Marcus Smart was huge drop off from a healthy Kemba and it showed.
"Yes, that emoji clearly refers to Marcus Smart doing that exact pose during the playoffs"
"Marcus Smart is starting, Pritchard is the backup, and we’ll probably run a few lineups with Tatum essentially running the point and Romeo as a secondary ball handler."
Yes and I'm saying that to project him in the same tier as Dejounte FVV and Marcus Smart is insane
The Celtics would rather have Marcus Smart as their starting PG. That says it all.
There have been rumors of Marcus Smart being traded for 7 years.
Have you watched Marcus Smart play recently? I might have done it a year ago but now.... Not so much
Marcus smart
"While true, it doesn't seem like you guys are going to have a use for the money. If the Clippers offered you guys a Reggie Jackson/Marcus Smart sign and trade, that seems like a slam dunk yes especially if Jackson's salary is lower than Smart's."
Lmao 5.8apg with that Laker team is good? Oh maybe his 2.7 turnovers per game was what you meant to highlight? No that's bad too. Marcus Smart put up the same numbers on a shitty Boston team you think he'd put up the same shitty numbers with LBJ and AD? Context matters I'm not sure you even watch basketball just keep playing number ball bro
Did Marcus Smart die?
“And little else”. You must not know who marcus smart is cuz he’s been selected to the all defensive team twice the past 3 years and probably would’ve been last season if he didn’t play 48 games.
"As erratic as Marcus Smart can be, I don’t think the Celtics should get rid of him. Only if he can get you an all-star caliber player, and I can’t think of any that would be available rn. They need Smarts defense to compete in the conference."
"&gt;believe that the draft does not have to be nearly as hard as many teams will make it. I’m not interested in what the mocks say about where a guy should go. Five years will pass and when we look back at this 2018 draft, we’ll see a long line of players who fail to have real careers in the NBA. In the moment, the selections will not seem ludicrous because the mocks have brainwashed us to believe that the best prospects are listed in the correct range and order. So when I hear people say, “That is too high [or too low] to take [Player A],” I immediately cringe. Too high or too low according to what?  &gt;I care about one thing when it comes to the draft: getting a player who does not suck. Some of these guys will be stars, some might end up just being role players, but I am 100 percent confident none of them will fail. Enough with the small talk. Time to put my money where my mouth is. Vernodamus is here to save the day. These players will not suck (and if they do, I will absolutely blame the situation and the coaching):   * **Marvin Bagley III**   &gt;I seriously wonder if I have different eyeballs than everyone else. There is a 0 percent chance that Bagley is not awesome in the NBA. I’m not sure that he has ever played in a game in his life where he was not the best player on the floor. Coach K said the following regarding Bagley: “He is not a good runner; he’s an amazing runner. And then he’s an amazing repeated jumper. In other words, he doesn’t really take time to even land, he just pops right back up. He wants to learn, he has no demons, he’s a great kid, he’s smart, and has an incredible motor. He never has a bad day. He’s a treasure, really. He’s going to be one of the great players in the NBA during his time.” Coach K also said that in his 38 years at Duke he has had only one other player like him: Kyrie Irving. I honestly have no idea how he is not the consensus first pick in the draft.  * **Luka Doncic**  &gt;I have expressed my worry that Doncic might not have the athleticism it takes to be a massive star in the NBA. That being said, he is smart, he plays hard, and he can dribble, pass, and shoot. I’m positive he is not going to be a failure. He is too good at basketball to fail. He also has a massive tiger tattoo on his forearm, which is a big plus. More than anything, I have warmed up to him more and more since the word that NBA teams have cooled on him, because that means he is probably amazing.  * **Wendell Carter Jr.**  &gt;This is a little reminiscent of when Al Horford and Joakim Noah were in the same draft in 2007. I loved both of them and thought there was no chance that either of them would fail. It was just a matter of how good they were going to be. Bagley is the best prospect in the draft in my opinion, but Carter is also a beast. His fundamentals are ridiculous, he is huge and has a massive wingspan — and his shot looks as good as any player’s in the draft. A smart big that can run the floor, plays hard, and can shoot 3s? Those guys don’t fail.  * **Collin Sexton**  &gt;I love Sexton. He is smart, he is lightning fast, and he plays every game like it is his last game on earth. An absolute fighter who routinely plays his best against the best competition. You need guys like Sexton in the NBA playoffs. I think his ceiling is much higher than most people seem to think, and I know, no matter what, I will love having this guy on my team.  * **Miles Bridges**  &gt;He can dribble, pass, and shoot. He is a freak athlete. He is a smart kid that comes off great in all of his interviews. He is tough as nails. You can have the guys that you think are going to be good, and I’ll take the one that I know will be. Miles Bridges is a perfect example of why teams and analysts miss in the NBA draft. He will absolutely be better than many players taken in front of him and you can see it from a mile away.  * **Jacob Evans**  &gt;Cincinnati won a school-record 31 games, and Evans was the best prospect on the team. His sophomore season he was a finalist for the Jerry West Award, which goes to the best shooting guard in the country, and his junior year he was a finalist for the Julius Erving Award, which goes to the best small forward in the country. Cincy coach Mick Cronin had this to say about him: “He is a winner. He shoots a high percentage. He’s an elite defender. He blocks shots. He guards point guards. He rebounds. He just does so many things, and he’s a coach on the floor. He’s such a smart player.” Umm, sold.  * **Donte DiVincenzo**  &gt;At one point during this draft process, someone asked me, “If we saw DiVincenzo drop 31 in the title game, be great all season, and test physically off the charts, then why in the hell is he supposed to go late first round?” Great question, anonymous guy! The answer is because that is where the mock draft consensus has him slotted, and the mock draft consensus is dumb. He’s a big-time competitor, super athlete, can shoot the cover off the ball, and in the biggest game of the season, he looked like the best player on maybe the best college team I have ever seen.  * **Rawle Alkins**  &gt;Brooklyn in the house! Alkins was a high school force of nature who won three city titles and two state championships in New York. He had a foot issue that hampered his career at Arizona, but this kid has so many attributes that I love. Unstoppable motor, built like a linebacker, good-looking shot, and do-or-die playing style. He has been projected too low since this process started. Alkins will be a fan favorite wherever he plays. You want a Marcus Smart, Tony Allen, or P.J. Tucker–type player when you need a big play in a big game. I see that with Alkins.  * **Jevon Carter**  &gt;You do not want to be guarded by Jevon Carter. Bob Huggins called him “the best defensive player I have ever coached.” Whoa. Carter reminds me of the kind of guy who is playing in the park where the winner stays on the court, and you could leave for six hours and come back and his team would still be playing. He was conference defensive player of the year twice, and national defensive player of the year last year. He affects every game that he plays in. Bona fide bulldog. Every roster in the NBA could use a guy like him."
If Simmons would shoot the ball even at Marcus Smart level and make 75% of his free throws he would be a superstar.
"The real question is who will be brave enough to put Marcus Smart, Bruce Brown, and PJ Tucker together on the same team."
Marcus Smart for Terry Rozier who says no?
"They should find a way to do a sign and trade with boston, Marcus smart for schroeder(sp?)"
Need Marcus Smart
"I think that story coming out where Marcus Smart basically admitted he's had to deal with racist fans probably soured Boston as a destination for alot of guys. They're aware of that shit, they probably hear it when they go play in Boston."
"He really didn’t, though.   The epitome of Ainge’s building culminated in Kyrie/Brown/Hayward/Tatum/Horford with Smart/Rozier/Marcus Morris coming off the bench. That’s one of the most stacked rosters on paper in the last few decades. Not his fault at all that Hayward died and Kyrie decided to force his way out."
"New Coach will change that i think. Horford has always been good at running the offense so i expect him to do a lot of that with the second unit, I believe Marcus Smart can be a solid starting point guard for this team if he embraces the role, he has always been a good passer. as for shooters, our rookies last year were thrown into the fire with no practices or summer leauge so i expect Prichard and Neismith to take a large leap this season and both of them can knock down the three ball with ease. Then it just comes down to player growth, Bostons championship window is in 2-3 years so let Tatum Brown and Romeo get better and facilitating and running the offense and make the leap after the superteams of the nets and lakers retire."
"I like Bill and I enjoy the podcast, I'm a Warriors fan and not a celtics fan but I don't mind the celtics stuff at this point because I at least know it's a constant and consistent reference point for his comparisons (I know what he means if he says a guy does ""Marcus Smart things""). What you can completely notice now is that he doesn't (if he ever did) watch irrelevant teams, which until this season the knicks were. He doesn't spend any time analyzing teams that aren't expecting to do anything and who aren't the Celtics so any thoughts he has on those teams should be taken with a grain of salt.  I don't mind it because I'm a warriors fan and he seems to like the Warriors and Steph, but if I were a Kings fan or a pelicans fan I might be pissed that I'm only a brought up in terms of how contenders can pillage them of their resources."
"Marcus Smart is our 3rd best player, by a significant margin. Our depth is nonexistent."
"Marcus Smart? Yeah. Jaylen? Hell no. The idea is to get 3 stars, not trade one for another."
"Boston has a great foundation, but they need to do something more bold to take the team to the next level. I don’t get why they refuse to. If it takes losing Jaylen Brown or Marcus Smart, do it."
"&gt; That's about the only way they could get $50 million under the cap, which is what they'd need to create the necessary cap space to make Beal a max offer next summer, and that all seems incredibly unrealistic.  This is true if FA is the only route to getting Beal. But it isn't - there are a number of trade routes to getting Beal (at the deadline if Beal makes it clear he wants to hit FA, after he hits FA as a S&amp;T, or as an opt-in-and-trade after he hits FA). What is important is that the Celtics *can* sign Beal outright by taking this 'ultimate-pain-renounce-everyone' route so that we can get the Wizards to the negotiating table for a sign and trade when the time comes. The Celtics need the flexibility to appear to be a credible threat for FA.  &gt; I think if Washington gets any sense that Beal may actually leave next summer then they'll probably trade him this summer or upcoming season rather than let it go to free agency, but I could be wrong.  Washington is honestly playing this terribly. The only things Beal has said so far this season is 1. when asked directly about his future in WAS, he said 'not even going to think about that' 2. rumors were he was frustrated his coach pick in Cassell didn't get a 2nd interview. Keep in mind that if Beal gets traded mid-season he's still extremely likely to go into free agency. That diminishes the haul the Wizards would get back, Celtics or not.  &gt; And now apparently the sides are very far apart on a Marcus Smart extension because what Smart wants will put Boston in the tax a year from now  They're not that far apart. There's a limit to any Smart extension (capping at 4/77), so there's also a limit to how far off they are. It just doesn't make sense to sign the extension now if the goal is to present yourself as having FA space.  &gt; I just don't think it's realistic that Boston would risk the total decimation of their team in the hopes that Beal signs with them.  I mean, what are we losing? Just Smart, right? The rest of the players have to be renounced, so we'd retain their rights up until Beal decides. The team doesn't get decimated before any FA moves we make."
Marcus Smart going from 25% to 28%
"He's wrong about that though, but this is what I've seen a bunch of Celtics fans telling themselves to try to justify why the front office has made the moves they have. To get Beal in free agency, the Celtics would have to find a way to salary dump Horford with no money coming back, they'd have to let Marcus Smart and Robert Williams simply walk in free agency, and they'd have to renounce basically everyone except for Tatum and Brown and maybe Payton Pritchard and Aaron Nesmith. That's about the only way they could get $50 million under the cap, which is what they'd need to create the necessary cap space to make Beal a max offer next summer, and that all seems incredibly unrealistic.   They could try to figure out a trade for Beal this season, but that would probably involve Jaylen Brown, and I don't think Boston wants to do that. I think if Washington gets any sense that Beal may actually leave next summer then they'll probably trade him this summer or upcoming season rather than let it go to free agency, but I could be wrong.   What Boston is actually doing is just trying to get under the luxury tax. Tatum's extension kicked in this off-season and that made it so Boston either needed to make some cuts or go into the tax. So they gave up a 1st to swap Kemba for Horford and save some money there, and then they let Fournier walk, replacing him with Josh Richardson for about $8 million less than Fournier would have cost. And now apparently the sides are very far apart on a Marcus Smart extension because what Smart wants will put Boston in the tax a year from now, especially since they're gonna have to pay Robert Williams as well.   The big indicator that this ""max cap space in 2022"" thing is bogus will be if they trade Marcus Smart once extension talks truly break down. If this ""no contracts beyond 2022"" thing is true, then Smart being an expiring would be just what they're looking for. But instead my guess is if they can't extend him, they'll trade him rather than just have him walk in free agency like Horford, Hayward, Kyrie and Fournier did. I just don't think it's realistic that Boston would risk the total decimation of their team in the hopes that Beal signs with them. If he didn't they'd be absolutely fucked, and there's simply no way they can count on him doing that. It's just not a realistic plan for any team to have."

Next up Marcus Smart to the 76rs
Next up: Marcus Smart to the 76ers
"That just isn't true. You have Marcus Smart show up for around 25 games a year. Seriously though, Smart is almost always great on defense. The issue is, on offense, you never know which Marcus you are going to get. One night, he seemingly can't miss. Then, the next three, it is like he forgot to shoot"
"Over the past few years he's come to indulge his worst habits and just clearly doesn't pay as close attention to the league as he used to. His player evaluations are increasingly prone to wild recency bias to the point of absurdity. His recent free agency pod with Jackie mac had a number of flat out incorrect statements that could have been avoided with the most minor of background work or research, which might be forgivable if he wasn't so obnoxiously confident in his errors. He's always been a homer, and that's admittedly been part of his charm, but it's gotten to the point where Marcus Smart gets discussed for like 10 minutes every NBA pod he does like he's one of the most valuable assets in the league. He used to bring the insight of a guy who was passionate and followed closely enough that he helped introduce me to some basic ""analytical"" concepts, now he increasingly feels like another guy pulling hot takes out of his ass."
Thought smart move meant Marcus smart moving for a second
"Yeah that’s true, it was a good signing in theory. The poor guy’s knees didn’t hold up. They should have kept Horford, and then tried to find a real point guard that can shoot and get decent amount of assists. I love Marcus Smart but I’m not sure if they are keeping him or not."
"You don't get 20 ppg scorers with the MLE, we should have paid him, we had his Bird Rights. Also, please take a look at the roster without him. Our #3 is now Marcus Smart at 13 PPG on sub 40% shooting"
"Entering the 2017-18 season we had:  Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Marcus Morris, and Aron Baynes.  We also controlled the rights to Sacramento's draft pick in 2019 and had the Grizzlies first-round pick protected 1-7 until 2021.   It was such a ridiculous position to be in that Zach Lowe at that time called it maybe the greatest rebuild in the history of the NBA coming off the KG-Pierce trade where we blew it up.   Now, only 3 of those players remain, and both of those draft picks that were thought to be treasured assets turned into late-lottery picks. It's unbelievable.   Curse of IT is/was real. Let's hope it's ended now that Danny is gone."
Bro Marcus Smart drew a charge from an inbounds pass to Harden (As a rocket) [twice](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1a4CnOtVn0U)
"It’s not a bad package but that’s just not Morey’s style, especially when he has a top 10 player in Embiid. I think he’d rather get something like Kemba and Marcus Smart than bench guys and picks"
"And he doesn't even try to shoot his way to getting better, it's been like 4 years now   Marcus smart is a great example of just sticking with it til it works"
People here hate on LBJ because well he's in LA and he is Lebron. Shit was a Marcus Smart level flop that went bad
Haha sorry mr pillow I’ll cool my jets a little I’m all amped up on Miller lites and Marcus smart
People actually bought Marcus Smart jerseys? What were they thinking?
"""A flop for a flop""  - Marcus Smart"
"""That wasn't contact""  *Replay shows Kyrie shoving Marcus Smart to the ground.*  Mark Jackson doesn't like Marcus Smart and it shows.  He tried to claim boxing out was dirty basketball earlier.  What a clown."
Lol Marcus Smart is seriously sitting 5/8 on 3s? Get the fuck out of here
Marcus Smart on his 2016 level flopping lol. Bad look but do what it takes to win I guess.
Marcus Smart is savy AF but he's probably the biggest flopper in the NBA.

Marcus Smart should be fined for that flop lol
Biggest flopper in NBA history Marcus Smart

MARCUS SMART KEEP MAKING WINNING PLAYS 💪💪
Every team needs a Marcus Smart
Fuck Marcus smart
Until Marcus Smart makes his appearance
Marcus Smart is an ironic name for the lowest IQ player in the league lol
Tatum has these games every couple of weeks where there is just nothing you can do to stop him  Marcus Smart and Joe Harris trading their 3 pt skills today is far more infuriating
Marcus Smart isn’t allowed to complain about flopping lol
People celebrating the Marcus Smart kickout and Tristan Thompson flop now furious as the refs.
"That wasn’t so smart, Marcus."
Marcus Smart with the dumb foul
Marcus Smart made a dirty play? WTF Griffin PULLED SMART'S ARM DOWN WITH HIM
Why is Marcus Smart rolling on the floor?
That’s the Marcus Smart experience
That was the marcus smart special right there. He was feeling himself just a little too much.
"In all fairness how could a team like the Nets expect to compete with the big three of: Jason Tatum, Marcus Smart and Tristan Thompson"
Marcus smart is not a roleplayer
The disrespect to Marcus smart
Hes Marcus Smart light in a bigger frame. He'll make every hustle play that the average player wouldn't. Everything he needs to do to be a fan favorite.
Everytime Marcus Smart shoots the ball I go through the five stages of grief.
People tryin to tell me joe harris a cheat code but have you heard of marcus smart? lmao
Marcus Smart showing Joe Harris how it’s done
Marcus Smart flopping? Who would've thought
Marcus Smart flopping? Color me surprised....
I love Marcus smart
Marcus Smart only makes the worst looking shots lol
They’re a 7 seed in the east and also don’t have their second best player lol they are not that good.  Not that what happened 7 years is even relevant considering Marcus Smart is the only player still on the team but they were one of the worst teams in the league in 2016 lol
There is one Marcus smart on the team though
"Eh ask Torii Hunter, Marcus Smart, Bill Russell and they'll say Boston is far more racist than other cities in the northeast"
Marcus Smart changes his shooting form every time I see one of his highlights.
"After he's done playing, i hope Smart starts his own chain of convenience stores called Marcus Mart."
I guess Marcus Smart is going to have to save the day
MARCUS SMART KING SHIT
I think racist *chants* was maybe a misspeak by OP. But multiple black players now have complained that Celtics fans have racially abused them in the past. Most recently were  Tristain Thompson and Marcus Smart.
"I just used your quote and Marcus Smart words. Not mine.   [https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/marcus-smart-nba-boston-celtics-covid-racial-injustice](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/marcus-smart-nba-boston-celtics-covid-racial-injustice)   Smart has shared more of his experiences here.   I'm not saying that the entire fanbase or the city of Boston is racist, but Danny Ainge has selective hearing or is delusional if he thinks that there aren't racist fans."
"&gt;“Quite honestly I’ve never heard any of it,” Ainge added. “I’m not saying the city of Boston, I’m saying the downtown or the TD Garden…I think our fans are very respectful.”  [https://twitter.com/KeithSmithNBA/status/1398006596836470785?s=20](https://twitter.com/KeithSmithNBA/status/1398006596836470785?s=20)   &gt;Marcus Smart on if he's heard Boston fans make racist comments: ""Yeah, I've heard it. I've heard a couple of things. It's hard to hear that and then have them support us as players. It's kind of sad and sickening."""
"Well Marcus Smart got called the n-word right outside of TD Garden, so maybe he shouldn't be going for technicalities if that's what he meant."
"I don’t think you can put them over Simmons, Holiday, Butler and Thybulle  Even after I would have Marcus Smart, and it depends what position Mikal plays"
"What are you trying to argue here? The date of when somebody said it to Smart originally? Dude u got urself so worked up over this u forgot what the argument was even about LMFAOO. How does that go against anything i said? He also endured a racist remark when driving and opened up about that previously? THAT DOESNT HELP YOUR ARGUMENT DUDE. You are just adding yet another racist incident i wasnt even initially alluding to?  Did you even listen to his comments from last night dude? I was never arguing about his car incident, as that is not a necessarily a fan? Theres thousands with cars in Boston who are not a fan of basketball, and you shouldnt put their actions on celtics fans? You just chose to bring yet another racist incident into the discussion, which completely further supports my initial statement that this happens more routinely in boston than other cities.  Now try doing some real research of your own. What Smart detailed last night was not one experience, and if you listened to anything your own players said instead of trying to defend your racist city youd understand.  &amp;#x200B;  ""Yeah, I've heard it. I've heard a couple of things. It's hard to hear that and then have them support us as players. It's kind of sad and sickening.""-Marcus Smart, following game 2.  &amp;#x200B;  Like somehow you worked yourself up so bad your argument has literally shapeshifted from, ""but boston is no more racist than anywhere else""  to  ""Yea but someone said that years ago""  Smart clearly is talking about numerous incidents that you want to attempt to condense into one racist incident, but we can all look up the evidence of what Celtic's players have directly said. Im not sure what you are even arguing at this point, the timetable for when your own fans have been racist to him before?"
"First off, never correct how someone speaks when u are unable to even make a google search to get a story correct. ur completely full of shit, blatantly lying hoping to not get called out by someone who actually follows the sport. Marcus Smart was months ago? Dude did you miss the comments he made LAST NIGHT?  &amp;#x200B;  [https://www.si.com/nba/2021/05/27/marcus-smart-kyrie-irving-boston-celtics-fans-racist-comments](https://www.si.com/nba/2021/05/27/marcus-smart-kyrie-irving-boston-celtics-fans-racist-comments)  ""ahead of game three against the nets""  See there ya go ur blatantly lying out of ur ass.  Lmfao, dude ur blinded by ur own ignorance. Nobody is saying Boston is the only city who still has racist fans? I showcased in my original comment how Utah is even more of a prevalent spot for these issues, but you just chose to get ur panties in a bunch over the mention that casual racism in Boston tends to be more prevalent than other cities?  Why must you use deflection based-defence when addressing a real issue in the city that so clearly lays near to your heart? Do you not see Jazz fans criticizing their own fans for their actions? That is ALL THIS IS. Nobody is saying everyone from Boston is racist, nobody is saying Boston has no good fans, this topic just clearly hit so close to home you personally chose to interpret it that way. Sorry it hurts you so deeply when others criticize your fellow racist fans. Next time actually criticize your fellow fans like you claim to, instead of directing your anger towards those who call it out as prevalent in boston. (fact.)"
"I think there's also another factor, KG is easily spotted. Marcus Smart is smaller and could easily blend in with a crowd of non-NBA players.  But yeah, no way someone saying that to KG. That's dumb."
"It would be difficult for anyone to really have a great sense of where racism is the worst or whatever, as most people generally only live in one or a couple areas, and aren't constantly getting a good sense for what life is like in lots of different cities. However, Black athletes probably have a fairly unique perspective given how frequently they are in so many different metropolitan areas every year, and they are the ones who seem to be pointing out that Boston is one of the places where it's particularly bad. There's obviously racist assholes everywhere, and that's before getting into how awful cops can be when dealing with people of color, no matter what part of the country they're in.   But what always stands out to me in these stories is how comfortable these people are with being so openly racist in front of strangers like that. Like those Jazz fans the other day who were saying that shit to Ja's family right in front of dozens of other Jazz fans who were total strangers to them, clearly thinking they must be among like-minded people who would be OK with what they were saying. Or like the Marcus Smart story about the woman who yelled the N word at him right outside the game when other fans were all around her. I don't understand their comfort with doing that so openly in public and I think it speaks to the perceived permissiveness by those locals that this is just kinda par for the course. I feel like if that kind of thing happened here where I live then you'd immediately have all the other people around them gang up on them and tell them that shit isn't acceptable. And fortunately that's what happened at the Jazz game the other night, but I'm not sure why it didn't happen in the story Marcus Smart told."
Marcus Smart
"Lmfao boston people voting you down or something? its literally notorious Boston has easily one of the most racist fan groups, behind maybe only Utah. Dude there was just a literal thread about how Marcus Smart always hears it from his own fans and it disappoints him. Boston people gotta do better and actually speak out against their dipshit fans, in a similar fashion to Utahs subs on here which are surprisingly outspoken against these moron fans."
"And Boston fans. So now we’ve heard stories from Avery Bradley, Marcus Smart, and now Tristian Thompson. They keep saying “It’s not the sixties anymore!”. These are players that we watch TODAY that are saying that Celtics fans are being racist as fuck towards them. They need to own up to the racism and shittiness in their fanbase and change it"
"[This is a Marc Spears article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/theundefeated.com/features/celtics-being-a-black-player-in-boston/amp/) that literally came out last year where he interviewed 30 players who have been a part of the Celtics, including Marcus Smart. The general consensus, like TT is saying here, is that Boston has racism, but you're protected from it if you're a Celtic.   For Ainge to be ignorant to in his bubble is dumb as hell. Dude shouldn't have said anything."
Marcus smart?
because I fucking hate marcus smart
can I get a fuck marcus smart please
Yeah especially after Marcus Smart said so
lol someone's parroting the marcus smart thread for karma. no one has said it's ok here
There was a story a few years back of a fan outside of the boston arena in an IT jersey calling marcus smart the hard r. .5% disgusting people is still enough to leave an impression for anyone
"Dude, one of his players, Marcus Smart, is saying this fan in the garden called me a racial slur, not the incident outside with the cross walk, literally inside the arena while playing. It's in the article, are you saying because Danny didnt hear it direct from his mouth it doesnt count? Imagine your own player saying that and your response being, well you said it to them, not to me. That's crazy"
"They're not people, they're entertainment. That's why so many athletes feel so uncomfortable like they're being treated like show ponies or something. Very dehumanizing. I think Marcus Smart said something to that effect earlier today."
you have marcus smart on your team...?
Marcus Smart said [today](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2914179-celtics-marcus-smart-recalls-racist-experience-with-fan-outside-of-td-garden.amp.html) that he's heard racism in TD Garden
"marcus smart wrote an athletic article about getting racially abused by celtics fans even, it's crazy  he said some lady in a celtics jersey called him the N word and it really shook him  it's not a boston thing or a utah thing, it happens in every city in every sports league in the whole world.  really sad that we can't move past racism as a society"
"See I doubted your comment and did some quick googling.   Here’s some links I found:   Smart saying hes heard racial slurs in the garden:   https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.boston.com/sports/boston-celtics/2021/05/27/marcus-smart-racist-comments-td-garden/%3famp=1  Incident right outside the garden as he’s heading to his car:   https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.bostonglobe.com/2020/10/19/sports/celtics-marcus-smart-details-racist-incident-outside-td-garden-players-tribune-column/%3foutputType=amp  Here’s a pretty lengthy article with a bunch of former players talking about their experiences with Boston, some good and some bad. Truthfully I didn’t read all of it:   https://www.google.ca/amp/s/theundefeated.com/features/celtics-being-a-black-player-in-boston/amp/  Hopefully that’s enough perspective for you to stop shifting the goal post from “boston isn’t racist” to “Boston fans aren’t racist”. You’ve got some good and some bad just own up to it."
"Right, it's pointing out racism in the city, but the issue still stems from the fact that people shouldn't have to hear it themselves to acknowledge its existence.  Bill Russell, Demarcus Cousins and Marcus Smart are three direct examples that can be sought as references to know it has occurred in the stadium so it's subtly playing into that narrative of denial."

"again that's not what Danny said. Heres the actual quote   “I think that everybody’s influencing somebody,” Ainge explained. “So yeah, I think that there’s – my fear is that could possibly happen. But I think that our players, and players that have played here in the past, all have their experiences to share, and that’s just one player.”  “Quite honestly I’ve never heard any of it,” Ainge added. “I’m not saying the city of Boston, I’m saying the downtown or the TD Garden…I think our fans are very respectful.”  So he knows shit goes down inside the city, (Marcus Smart happened while he was driving) but, he's never heard anything from his players about the fans inside the garden because not one of his players has ever complained"

"Marcus Smart also said [he got called a racial slur in the parking lot of the Garden](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/marcus-smart-nba-boston-celtics-covid-racial-injustice):  &gt;	I was pulling out of the arena parking lot when I saw a white woman with her five- or six-year-old son crossing against the light right as the cars were starting to come at them. I had my windows down and realized something bad was about to happen, so I yelled to her, politely, that she needed to hurry and get out of the street so the two of them wouldn’t get hurt.  &gt;The woman was wearing an Isaiah Thomas number 4 Celts jersey. And there were all these other Celtics fans around who were at the game. I figured she’d be cool.    &gt;Nope.  &gt;She swung her head around and it was…. “F*** you, you f***ing n-word!!!!”"
Bro you don't get it Marcus Smart is just trying to create a counter-narrative so when he unsurprisingly gets racist slurs hurled at him by his own fanbase he can have a reason to leave - I see through the lies of Marcus Smart
So you’re going to completely dismiss marcus smart
"Except for Marcus Smart right now, then? He refers to not knowing how you can support him as a player. He actually directly refers to “our fanbase.”  I’m gonna trust an actual Celtic over you, sorry."
"and? Danny isn't denying Marcus Smart heard something. Danny is saying he's never heard anything   downtown or at the TD Garden...once again let this sink in.   “I’m not saying the city of Boston, I’m saying the downtown or the TD Garden…"""
"Well, Marcus Smart had some things to say. Maybe shut up and listen before dismissing."
"For reference: https://theundefeated.com/features/celtics-being-a-black-player-in-boston/  &gt; Boston Celtics guard Marcus Smart was expecting a simple drive home after a game during the 2016-17 season when he encountered a vocal Celtics fan he will never forget. The woman was with a little boy in the middle of the crosswalk outside of TD Garden when the light turned green for oncoming traffic. Smart honked his horn to warn her. &gt;  &gt; “I yell out the window,” Smart recalled. “ ‘Excuse me, ma’am, you better get out of the street before you and your son get hit. Cars are coming. I don’t want you to get hit.’ &gt;  &gt; “As soon as I said that, she looked at me – as she is wearing a No. 4, green with the white outline Celtics jersey – and told me, ‘F— you, you f—ing n—–.’ People that actually heard her were stunned. They’re like, ‘That’s Marcus Smart. You just got done watching the game, ma’am … with an Isaiah Thomas jersey on.’ ”  ...  &gt; Avery Bradley, who played for the Celtics from 2010-2017, said one of his brothers had a racist incident at a Boston Bruins game. &gt;  &gt; “My family and friends experienced a lot of racism in Boston,” Bradley said. “If they weren’t with me, they experienced all types of stuff. At a hockey game, my brother almost got in a fight with some people because they were acting crazy. I never experienced it, but every other person I knew that was there experienced it.” &gt;  &gt; As Smart learned that night in his car outside of TD Garden, the difference can come down to street clothes versus game jersey. Former Celtics forward Glen Davis said Bostonians always gave him love and respect “because I wore the jersey of the Celtics,” but when he went out he occasionally heard racist words from fans. &gt;  &gt; “There were moments when you go out and a fan overdoes it,” Davis said. “For example … ‘Can you dunk, you big monkey?’ You would go out to the clubs, bars where some of the fans were drunk and would say things like that.”"
"&gt;Boston is the most highly educated city in America and that can simultaneously be the truth while their games can have heavy attendance of racists louts, some working class, some those same Harvard/MIT/Boston U educated types.  Ok so there's 2 things going on here and I'm gonna break it down for people who have never stepped foot in Boston.    The well educated and well paid people who attended prestigious universities aren't the ones who are going to the games and yelling racist shit, they're the ones side-eyeing guys like Marcus Smart in the grocery store of their wealthy neighborhood because ""someone like that shouldn't be here.""   The working class are the ones saying shit at games and are incredibly racist, but don't think they're racist because they're not saying the n-word."
"Marcus Smart: fly 5 feet back in the air from the force of the popcorn, land on his back  and grimace in pain. Shoot free throws  Edit. JR Smith: start a food fight and throw back a bowl of soup"
"The greatest player in your franchise’s history said that it exists within the fanbase. Marcus Smart has encountered it. Baseball players (Torii Hunter and CC Sabathia) have had encounters.   I get that it’s a larger societal issue, but you shouldn’t just be so dismissive over a person of color’s experience"

Marcus Smart
Kyrie  Marcus Smart  Jaylen Brown   Am I missing any other active players who played for the Celtics who have called their fans racists?
That article by Marcus Smart was a great read.
You literally tried to “add context” to make things better for him. When even if you have that context it does matter because Marcus smart a starting 5 player on his team has said to the media over and over he has experienced racism in Boston’s arena
Marcus smart literally when out in national discourse to talk about a woman calling the Nword in Boston. Keep on defending racism and apathy to racism. You’re a part of the problem
didn't marcus smart
Marcus Smart literally wrote a Player's Tribune article about racist Celtics fans last year...  https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/marcus-smart-nba-boston-celtics-covid-racial-injustice
Marcus Smart too
Let me get this straight.  You think Ainge and Marcus Smart have never discussed an incident that left such an impression on Smart that he felt compelled to write an article about it.
Marcus Smart is definitely about that life. Already did it in college
And that’s some BS considering someone Marcus Smart wrote an article about being called the n word in the TD garden.
"Celtics needed Tatum to drop 50, Marcus Smart to go 8/11 from the field, Tristan Thompson to score 19 and the entire Nets team except of Harden and KD to underperform massively just to win by 6 points"
Here’s some more stats- butler shot 29% over the entire Milwaukee series. That’s garbage. He’s basically Marcus smart with a couple more rebounds and assists and less clutch.
"Compared to Marv Albite calling literally every single Celtic ""Marcus Smart,"" that's light work. I'll take it"
"You’re forgetting it took a 50-piece from Tatum, a 19-point TT game and an 8-11 shooting night from Marcus Smart. How many times can this happen?   It’s still concerning for their defense though."
Now they’re saying Marcus Smart has cloned himself
Now they’re telling me that WASN’T Marcus Smart???
Lol he got lucky that he was on Marcus Smart for a lot of the game
Sometimes someone's energy just don't jive with ya that's all. I hate the Celtics but I still love me some Marcus smart and Jaylen Brown. For some reason I just don't feel that with Tatum. A certain je ne sais quois no?
"If Marcus smart thinks he’s going to get paid 30 million a year, that’s more or less irrelevant.  Because no team is going to offer that, because he cannot run an nba offense as a point guard.  Being able to add numbers does not give you the basketball knowledge to comment on GM decisions.   Be better."
There is nothing worse than watching Marcus Smart play basketball
Now they’re saying it’s Marcus Smart.
I actually started laughing out loud in the fourth when Marv finally realized that nesmith wasn’t Marcus smart and then called him Langford
Marcus smart. Take it or leave it.
"i mean it *is* pretty funny when he calls every player on our team ""Marcus Smart"""
Marcus Smart would like a word
Dude has called Aaron Nesmith Marcus Smart no less than 7 times
Marv alberts needs to end today with a “you people” after calling every black guy on the Celtics Marcus smart
Russ just a more athletic Marcus Smart if we being honest. Not the worst thing to be but not a guy you can count on to win you playoff games
You know the announcer is going to call Jalen brown “Marcus smart” at some point.
Aaron Nesmith is now Romeo Langford not Marcus Smart
Marv has called Nesmeth Marcus Smart twice and now Langford once. Poor guy.
"No.   Because you still don’t get basketball, I’ll explain it to you. FVV or Schroeder can run an nba offense.   Marcus smart cannot because he is not a threat to score at all.  He’s a player that gets overrated because he plays for a big market."
so Nesmith has been called marcus smart and now Romeo tonight don't think he's been called by his own name by Marv once
Don't forget like 5 years ago Marv said Marcus Smart on a Jae Crowder dunk.
According to Marv both Aaron Nesmith and semi ojoley are both Marcus smart.
This game is literally Beal tatum walker and ish Smith hitting fuck you shots and the senile ass announcer is spending his time calling every black guy Marcus smart
"Anyone just hear Marv call Aaron Nesmith Marcus Smart when Smart was clearly on the other end lmao  And then his co-announcer just said Tatum had the most points in a game by a Duke player (60) and Marv asked him ""wait who?"""
Damn I can't believe the Wizards keep fouling Marcus Smart. They just gotta sag off Marcus Smart so they can bring the double on Marcus Smart without fouling
This Marcus Smart character is playing a lot of minutes.
"I'm not a huge fan of piling on Marv, but c'mon man.  That was not Marcus Smart."
Marv has no clue who marcus smart is
Marv that’s not Marcus smart lmfao
Marv Albert had to of gotten Aaron Nesmith and Marcus Smart confused at least 5 times already
"I really like that Smart passed it to Nesmith even though he was wide open. Not just because oh fuck Marcus, but because it gives Nesmith confidence"
Kemba been playing with Marcus Smart for too long already
"I mean, I get it, he looks like he's going to be really, really good. But for now, he kind of just sucks, like most rookies. Takes a lot of shots and puts the ball in the hoop with the efficiency of Marcus Smart."
this is what happens when marcus smart is the best facilitator on the team.
most marcus smart play ever to take a charge on a half court shot with .2 seconds left
That might’ve been the most Marcus Smart charge in the history of Marcus Smart charges. Gotta respect it lol
They really gotta locate the sniper that shot Marcus Smart
Marcus Smart 🤝 OG Anunoby  Secretly joining the WWE
Marcus Smart is back - a huuuge surprise
Ouch Marcus Smart :(  My favorite Celtic
"https://twitter.com/byjayking/status/1394833409936175107?s=21  &gt;	Marcus Smart has returned to the Celtics bench. He's moving his right foot around like the ankle is hurting him, but now working with some sort of exercise band."
"Marcus Smart usually stops acting if he doesn’t get the call, I don’t think that was a flop at all. Hopefully he just tweaked his knee or something"
Marcus smart just fell over. I honestly thought it was a flop at first but he limped off the court
Marcus Smart took a sharpnell to his calf there
"I feel like Marcus Smart has a throwback, tough persona. But the second someone commits an old school foul he turns to the ref begging for an intentional/flagrant call.  Edit: this was before his apparent injury and is unrelated."
Rolo + Smith: name a better duo. Also fuck Marcus Smart
I would love Marcus smart
Yeah I’d like one Marcus Smart pls
Marcus smart stfu
Marv Albert called Aaron Nesmith Marcus Smart twice already and smart is on the bench lmao
Marcus Smart with the rebound off the bench!
"the announcers called Aaron Nesmith and then Semi Ojeleye ""Marcus Smart"" on back-to-back possessions"
Marcus Smart shooting a 3 from the bench!
Marcus smart stepping up. Fournier stepping up
MJ needs to trade for Marcus Smart
"I don’t know why you seem to think that Marcus smart is getting paid like a borderline all star.  I really don’t get it. A guy who is as bad in the halfcourt as smart is will not ever fetch FVV money. Ever.   Fred is elite coming off of screens and with the ball. If the Celtics replaced smart with FVV they would be a lot better given that they were rolling when they had all 3 of kemba tatum and brown healthy, and Fred can step into that role that kemba left much better than smart could."
"Like I fuckkng said jackass he’s terrific when you have someone else running the offense. But he’s also very one dimensional. I’ve watched AC since fucking summer league when we ran him with Zo, Matt Thomas, Kuz and Zublocka. He’s not elite defensively,...very good yes, elite no. Not bad he proven he can even start a full season. Not a shot creator, not that good creating for others in the half court, has been very up and down as a shooter. Despite hitting 40% he doesn’t create the kind of gravity you would expect because he can’t come off of screen or pin downs.   He absolutely has struggled against sg’s in the past defensively, and he doesn’t create much offense for himself “though I will credit him his last year on a two way contract he really showed me more than I expected offensively for like 10 games or so at the end of the season when we were already eliminated from postseason. And he’s had a few good games this year like that such   Caruso hits at 40%, but like I’ve said over and over, he is hesitant to take the shot. For all the open looks he receives only take 2 triples a game is low. Ac is an absolutely terrific role player and I have never fuckkng denied that. But I’m not paying a guy like Caruso anything over ten million if I don’t have a star player do I sting the ball in the half court allowing him to simply defend and catch and shoot. Like I said from the fucking start!!! He’s worth 12 for the lakers and a few other teams. But he is absolutely not a 12 million dollar player in the grand scheme of things.   How many times have we seen overachievers get paid and then struggle outside of the systems that made them look like studs. I guess you would say he’s as good as Marcus smart? Or a Josh richardson,....or anywhere near as good as a Christian wood who only makes 14. Think about this. Caruso is extremely similar to dellavadova in cleveland with bron. Top level d, huh iq, limited skill level, good shooting percentages on lower volume. I’m not paying that kind of money to AC fresh when I gotta still pay THT, Drummond (perhaps even tho he kinda sucks), Dennis, and possibly McLemore. 12 million is just too high for a type of player you can get for cheaper out of a vet."
"I think Fournier get re-signed, if anything I can see Smart getting traded. With only one year left on his contract and the emergence of Pritchard, I think Ainge would see what he can get for Marcus (praying for a big)"
"They had the unprotected Kings pick and Grizzlies pick which everyone thought were gonna be high lottery picks and instead ended up both being 14th (Langford and Nesmith, not exactly impact guys), and on top of that they had three max level players just walk away from them in free agency over the course of two summers, in Kyrie, Horford and Hayward. It's really not surprising that they took such a large step back this year.  If I had to pick someone who won't be back with Boston next year, it's not Brad Stevens, it's Evan Fournier. To re-sign him Boston would have to go into the luxury tax, and it's extremely unlikely they're gonna do that after the season they just had.   I'll also be curious to see what happens with contact extension negotiations with Marcus Smart this summer. Given the contract FVV got and what Dennis Schroder thinks he's worth, I'd have to imagine Smart probably believes he's worth somewhere around $22-25 million per year, and I have a feeling Boston won't want to give him that much. If Boston can't negotiate an extension with him, will they try to trade him or just let him go through next year on an expiring deal? That didn't work very well for them with Kyrie, Horford and Hayward."
Marcus Smart did it like 3 times in back to back to back possessions lol
got away from Marcus Smart
His All-NBA teams were alright. His rookie teams made no sense (only one center on two teams) and his All-Defense teams were hastily put together (Marcus Smart should not be there having only played 48 games).
marcus smart probably came pretty close to those marks his first few years but he does offer other things on the court
"first NBA game I ever went to was in Sacramento around Thanksgiving 2012. D'Antoni had just been hired, Nash was hurt, Dwight and Pau played like ass, Kobe had like 36 but we got lit up by Marcus Thornton and they blew us out. The whole time I sat next to this fat white guy who literally BELLOWED the whole game, and at one point he was yelling ""PLAY JIMMER! HEY COACH SMART, YOU'RE NOT VERY SMART! PLAY JIMMER!!!""  someone posted a Kings highlight before the pandemic and I heard that guy again! I'm guessing he's a season ticket holder, but damn did he kind of ruin my first game experience"
simmons was remarking on his podcast how this is one of the softest celtics teams ever  i didnt consciously consider that notion until he said it but it really is.  other than marcus smart and robert williams (and sometimes when brown just dices to the hoop and yams on two people) none of the players are really intimidating or seem mamba-like in mentality
"It’s meaningful when it’s Marcus Smart who also once shot 22 threes in a game. Case in point is barely anyone batted an eye when Steph shot 22, because it isn’t unusual that he shoots a ton of threes. This season he also had the 2nd highest 3PA per game ever. What an odd coincidence."
Marcus smart
*Marcus Smart has entered the chat.*
"I think the problem with interpreting bad shooters' presence on the floor is that sometimes it doesn't account for how even a few bad/inconsistent ones are guarded like good shooters, thereby helping their teams. Marcus Smart is the perfect example."
"**ALL-NBA**  *FIRST TEAM*  G: Stephen Curry, Damian Lillard  F: Luka Doncic, Giannis Antetokounmpo  C: Nikola Jokic  *SECOND TEAM*  G: Chris Paul, Jimmy Butler  F: LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard  C: Joel Embiid  *THIRD TEAM*  G: Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal  F: Julius Randle, Paul George  C: Rudy Gobert  ----  **ALL-DEFENSE**  *FIRST TEAM*  G: Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler  F: Draymond Green, Giannis Antetokounmpo  C: Rudy Gobert  *SECOND TEAM*  G: Marcus Smart, Jrue Holiday  F: Matisse Thybulle, Bam Adebayo  C: Joel Embiid  ----  **ALL-ROOKIE**  *FIRST TEAM*  LaMelo Ball, Tyrese Haliburton, Anthony Edwards, Desmond Bane, Immanuel Quickley  *SECOND TEAM*  Jae'Sean Tate, Isaiah Stewart, Saddiq Bey, Payton Pritchard, Facundo Campazzo"
Trae “James ‘Marcus ‘Kyle ‘LeBron ‘Manu Ginobili’ James’ Lowry’ Smart’ Harden” Young.
"The still image makes it look bad, but I doubt Solomon Hill saw it in slow-mo like it was the Matrix. He sees the ball on the ground, and goes for it, but in the time it takes him to process and get to ground, Lebron steps in and picks it up. It’s unfortunate and one of the dangers of diving around for loose balls (I’m stunned Marcus Smart isn’t injured more), but it’s not a dirty play."
Can’t believe Marcus Smart let 22 threes fly and hit 11 of them
"What or who? The top 2 pg defenders ought to make it every year, but that’s certainly not always the case. Examples of guys that I’d put on the teams over FVV include jrue, marcus smart, Ben simmons if he counts, dejounte murray and likely some others i can’t remember rn"
"2014 was a weird draft class. Wiggins 1st, Jabari Parker 2nd.    Embiid at 3rd, Aaron Gordon 4th and Marcus Smart 6th were the only top ten picks that weren't total busts imo. Remember Dante Exum and Nic Stauskas? Yeah me neither but they sound kind of familiar. Elfrid Payton, to whom I've frequently heard Knicks fans refer as the devil himself, rounds it off at number 10.    Zach Lavine went 13th, and Jokic didnt get taken until the 2nd round. Crazy huh?    CBS sports ranks it as the 5th worst draft class of the last two decades: https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-draft-looking-back-and-ranking-the-five-worst-draft-classes-since-2000/"
"Will Marcus Smart be ready for the playins?     Come on Boston, give us Wiz vs Nets !!!!!"
I love Marcus Smart and I FUCKING HATE the Celtics.
"I hold a special place in my heart for the broadcasters that are extreme homers, it's very comical to me, like a parody.   E.g. the Celtics guys talking about how brutal a hit was on Marcus Smart while the replay is being shown and he is clearly flopping. Or saying 'I don't see the foul' when a center hacks the fuck out of a guard driving to the rim."
"No. Nothing else to say other than a deadpan ""Marcus Smart **arguably** had a better season than everyone on this list""  it's so obvious to not be taken seriously. No need for a ""/s"" or to rephrase it. How I said it is all I needed to say. And I honestly anticipated r/nba to downvote the comment because this sub can't tell what is or isn't a serious comment if their life depended on it."
"Marcus Smart. Hear me out, he ain't a scrub on defense. All-nba. But on offense, he's just ok. But he turns into Steph Curry when he plays Raptors. A career 32% 3 point shooter, he shot nearly 40% against Raptors in East Conf semis 2019-2020. In the first round and conference Finals, he shot only 27% from 3. He attempted as many 3s in Raptors series as he did in the other 2 series combined (62 vs 61). Smart was the reason Celtics won the series vs Raptors. If he just shot his 32% Celtics ain't winning that series."
"Oklahoma beat KU in the Phog one year when the great Marcus Smart was playing for OU.  Smart flopped at a critical point in the game that gave OU the lead.  He and the refs were roundly booed of course.    As OU was heading off the court at the end of the game fans were giving it to him.  He turned and gave that big innocent Marcus smile and re-created his flop for them on his way off the court. Really funny.  KU fans loved Smart, a great college player."
Marcus Smart - was Marcus Smart
AI was another breed of ball player. A total junkyard dog. As a Celtics fan I always wish Marcus Smart was able to develop that part of his game because the current version that just chucks brick 3s is terrible.
"Tristan Thompson played 54 games, Marcus smart played a few less at 48 and kemba played 43 and you guys acquired players like Evan Fournier who have been healthy for the most part since you’ve got him but won’t show up in that stat at all. Yes you guys missed a few good players for a dozen or two games but most teams can say the same this season. I don’t think it’s fair to say you had as bad or even worse talent, even with the injures than a team tied for the 12th seed in the west. I think it’s fair to say you guys just underperformed, but it’s not the talent."
"Brown is far better than Ingram. Kemba still played 43 games this year, only 12 less than lonzo so that’s not a fair argument, and even hurt he’s far better and than lonzo. Celtics also have Tristan Thompson, Marcus smart, and Evan Fournier. I would argue that each team has comparable first options but the Celtics have a better 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th options. Yeah the Celtics have been injured a decent amount which is unfortunate but they do not have comparable talents whatsoever"
"Dallas guys always go off against us. Myles Turner, Randle, marcus smart, this dude, LMA and Bosh when they played."
Jaylen brown jayson tatum and marcus smart is highway robbery for old pierce and kg. The issue is the rest of their assets they didnt capitalize on. Boston 100 percent robbed the nets but they fucked themselves in the foot by not doing anything at all with those other picks
Looking at you Marcus Smart
Please do this. I'm tired of watching Marcus Smart and Blake Griffin fall before contact even happens.
Get rid of Marcus smart
Marcus smart is consistently the Gasoline on the team chemistry fire.
So many tipped passes.  I wonder what’s the deflection stats are for him.  Also the other game our broadcast team had something on one on one defenders and Suggs and Franz were both up their.  Suggs defensive stats are supposedly insane.  I want to look in to it more.  He’s basically turning into a 6’5 Marcus Smart at times.  If he ever gets stronger he might be able to guard even bigger people like Smart.
Suggs is just better than Hampton at everything.  Ironically Suggs finishing which was his big weakness is now his real offensive strength.  He’s so strong driving to the basket people bounce off of him.  He works best as someone coming off a handoff where he can barrel to the rim and try to draw fouls.  Also defensively he’s starting to remind me a little of Marcus Smart.  We had it in our minds that he was this point guard but I wouldn’t complain if he became a more athletic Marcus Smart who knew his limitations.
Marcus smart fucking blows and if he shoots more than 10 times the Celtics lose something like 80% of the time. He can shut his fucking mediocre mouth
"I mean out of all the sports in Boston, the Celtics by far have the most positive/nice fans. We call them “green teamers” and they believe the Celtics can do no wrong. These are the people that will try and convince you Marcus smart is an elite PG.   That being said I don’t think I’ve noticed much booing and people here seem kinda meh on the team going into it anyways. Expectations aren’t super high so I’m not sure as to why people would be booing what they see on the court when it’s going about how we thought. Maybe I’m missing something?"
Marcus Smart has got to go. They need a real point guard.
"Position isn't everything. Marcus Smart isn't a traditional point guard, and Brown/Tatum are the guys with the ball in their hands a lot more. It's kind of like looking at a LeBron-led team where he might nominally be listed at the 3 or the 4, but he's going to lead the team in passing just because he's bringing the ball up the floor and running the office."
My love for marcus smart continues to grow. My captain.  SOMEONE needs to tell Tatum to stop throwing these games away when he REFUSES to pass.
Marcus smart for Ben Simmons
"Brown and Tatum both had 3 assists, which isn't great, but the starting PG, a guy named Marcus Smart, had zero.    Zero assists and this is your take away as the starting PG?"
"Really the same thing as last season, very poor ball movement that usually ends in Tatum or Brown taking a tough shot. Kinda expected when Marcus Smart is your teams best playmaker"
"Just what I want to see, more Marcus Smart shots over Jaylen and Jayson"
"Yeah, I wasn’t the biggest Kobe fan in the world but he’s a winner and played with confidence and toughness. His game wouldn’t translate well in this current era.   Maybe Tatum turns into something similar to Kobe, but he got called out by Marcus Smart for not passing the ball. I agree - i watched the last couple of games, the guy just dribbles and jacks up a contested 3"
"Shots weren’t fired. This is the Vet on the team teaching the young bloods what they have to do. I love how he isn’t super “media/PC” about it. He could’ve sugar coated it and said “they’re scoring game is amazing, once they learn how to efficiently pass they’ll be unstoppable”, but fuck that. Marcus smart is raw and uncensored.   Also, have any of you played basketball? People talk like this to and about their teammates. Not a bad thing was said"
Are they supposed to pass the ball to you Marcus Smart? Mr 28% on 6 3s a game?   Or maybe Dennis Schroeder shooting 35%? Who are they supposed to pass the ball to lmao
"Marcus Smart going after Ime and the Jays in the press, while shooting 29%, after getting suspended to start the year, is not a good look."
"November 2nd:  In other news today, the Celtics traded guard Marcus Smart for some twinkies and half the corpse of Kevin Love."
T Ross for Marcus Smart
marcus smart for ben simmons
"Yeah, now they're playing with chemistry and Marcus Smart did not publicly call out the two stars for being ball hogs"
"It's still staggering to think that just three years ago the Celtics had Tatum, Brown, Kyrie, Hayward, Horford, Smart, Rozier, Marcus Morris, Aron Baynes and Daniel Theis along with two highly coveted draft assets in the Kings and Grizzlies unprotected picks in consecutive years, and Boston is now *here*. Danny Ainge did a great job of setting the table for a huge move or two and then just insanely stood pat while the draft assets lost almost all their trade value and most of those players simply left in free agency. Looking back you have to wonder what could have been. Looking forward you have to wonder how long Brown and Tatum will want to stay. What an absolute catastrophe."
Right.  Like yeah... I'm sure Marcus Smart out of everyone has been a quiet recluse in the corner of the locker room lmao
"Marcus N Smart. The ""N"" is for Not"
Congrats to Marcus Smart on his recent graduation from the Doc Rivers School of Public Relations
Love myself some Marcus smart but they asking him to play a role he sure as shit ain't suited for
"Meanwhile, Marcus smart the current starting PG had zero assists for the game…"
Marcus Smart for Eric Bledsoe?
The Jays have been terrible but I don't want to hear it from Marcus Smart lmao the guy is among the worst offensive players in the league. Brad Stevens should be fired for giving Smart such a big extension.
"All those years spent hoarding draft picks, all those years saying Brad Stevens was a mastermind coach, all those years saying Jaylen and Jason were going to take the Celtics to infinity and beyond…their new coach doesn’t seem to be doing *anything* to get them to play with more heart. It kinda fun to see all the Celtics homers feelings get hurt, but it’s also honestly kinda sad to see fun players like Marcus Smart wasted on ball hog dominated teams."
I completely agree with you this thing should have been keep in the locker room but considering it's Marcus Smart i just 🙄
"Who they gonna pass to? Marcus Smart? Dudes only in the league for defense. This dude got an efg% of 34%. not three point shooting %, efg%."
"Marcus Smart saying this while shooting 26% from the field and 24% from 3 (8% on open 3s and 33% on wide-open 3s) is just hilarious. Talk about ""right message, wrong messenger."""
Marcus smart is the starting point guard and had zero assists in the game…while complaining his two all star teammates don’t pass him the ball late in the game.
"Marcus ""Dyrus"" Smart"
maybe we shouldn't have convinced ourselves that marcus smart and rob williams were starting-caliber players
"They have no connective tissue. You aren't gonna win with a point guard rotation of Marcus Smart and Dennis Schroeder.  Tatum and Brown aren't the problem. They play just fine together most of the time, Tatum is just having a slow start, and even though their skillsets overlap, said skills are literally the best and most important in the entire NBA; defense, solo shot-creation, and shooting. Those are two of the most versatile two-way wings in the league; there's no team they WON'T fit on. The issue is, frankly, everyone else on the roster is just not that good.  Get a better playmaker."
I’m not a Marcus Smart fan in the slightest but that comment raises a lot of red flags (about the locker room and the culture of that group). Udoka needs to watch his ass if this goes sideaways quick.
acting like Kyrie is the only one who says it. Marcus Smart supported Kyrie on everything. Red Sox players talk about racist Boston fans. so do visiting players
"My favorite thing about the Celtics sucking so far this season is that no Celtics fan can agree on what the issue is. It's Ime that's the problem! No, it's not Ime, it's Brad. No, Brad needs more time, it's Tatum, he's not the guy. No Tatum is the guy, it's Jaylen doesn't have a killer mentality. No it's not Jaylen, Marcus Smart and the role players suck."
Dante Exum over Marcus smart 😔
"Yeah, they should. That way the Celtics would have someone to pass the ball to Marcus Smart."
To be fair Marcus smart stinks also
"Show us who's shittalkin Demar we got your back.  Also, thanks for continuing the trend of Marcus Smart getting dumpstered. No one makes fun of Toronto and gets away with it.."
"Marcus ""Not"" Smart with 0 assists tonight."
Didn't Marcus Smart get into a big argument with one of them in the locker room a couple seasons ago?
Bro Tatum passed to Smart for wide open 3 and Marcus Smart bricked
"Ah yes... Marcus Smart, certified playmaker"
Marcus smart and quietly in the same breath
Feels like Celtics need a floor general pace setter like Ricky Rubio..  Marcus Smart is not a starting PG for them
Friendly reminder that Brad Stevens thought Josh Richardson and Marcus Smart are worth more money than Evan Fournier lmao.
Marcus “starting point guard” Smart with 0 assists
That shot of Marcus Smart is gonna be a meme for the ages
"Udoka said he was not suggesting that white coaches couldn’t bond with Black players. He cited Popovich, who is white, as someone who has long stressed the importance of relationships. But for a new coach on a new team, it would be naïve to believe that race was not a factor.      “Basketball is mainly minority-based,” Celtics point guard Marcus Smart said in an interview. “So having a minority as a coach, I can connect with him. I can say things to him, or he can say things to me, and we get it. Whereas it’s different when you don’t. You have to try to figure out, OK, how can I meet them halfway?”"
"“Players were asking and demanding and wanting to see more guys who looked like them,” Udoka said. He added: “In coaching, I think there’s been a shift from Xs and Os and game plans to the value that’s placed on relationships. And there’s a natural cultural bond that Black coaches are going to have with their players.”  Udoka said he was not suggesting that white coaches couldn’t bond with Black players.

"Lol now I want to do a shit post on players whose names are sentences.  Marcus Smart, Kevin Love. It's like IM Weasel/IR Baboon"
"If Marcus Smart chips in, then you really know it’s good advice."
It's still early in the season and we can blame a lot of it on a new coach and potentially lack of a leader.  I personally think that a lack of a floor general hurts too. I love the idea of Ricky Rubio on the team but they'll ride out this season seeing if Marcus Smart can be their version of Ricky Rubio.
"You can blame Danny because at the end of the day his mismanagement of Assets has caused the Celtics to backpedal for a few consecutive seasons now. Stevens was right to make the Jays the face of the franchise but that transition was very, very ugly.  But it's still early in the season and we can blame a lot of it on a new coach and potentially lack of a leader. I personally think that a lack of a floor general hurts too. I love the idea of Ricky Rubio on the team but they'll ride out this season seeing if Marcus Smart can be their version of Ricky Rubio."
"Schroeder is 6th man, Smart starts. Schroeder started in place of JB and Marcus when they were out."
&gt; Marcus Smart at 33-35% doesn't kill your team.  I would agree in general but the rest of the shooting on this team makes it that his low percentage is really hard to stomach
Just not much of a point.  Career numbers are pointless because Smart has improved his shooting a lot.  For the last 3 years he's been a 34.5% 3-point shooter on high volume.  That's about what you expect out of Smart.  He's currently shooting 23% - that's worse than expectation.    Marcus Smart at 33-35% doesn't kill your team.
"Umm, how are they a complete team on paper? Unless I’m missing something, they’re starting Marcus Smart as their PG.  And for all the talk of Tatum and Brown as forwards that can “initiate an offense”, it just has not come to fruition.  They need a PG or another players that’s actually good at running an offense imo."
"Jayson Tatum - ISO scoring  Jaylen Brown - defense, his off-ball defense is particularly infuriating  Marcus Smart - similar to Jaylen, his off-ball defense is infuriating, except for a different reason, Jaylen's tendency is to fall asleep off ball, Smart over helps when he doesn't need to. And obviously his shot selection is not the best, not necessarily due to the shots he takes, but *when* he decides to take them. That's something I'm still hoping he can improve but I'm getting less optimistic as the years go by.  In general, this core always shits the bed in close games due to terrible execution of half-court offense."
"Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Marcus Smart, Robert Williams and ........ Dennis Schroder???"
Marcus smart for Dame straight up
He's like in that Marcus smart/Jae crowder category of guys who just piss off opposing fans to no end
Pat Bev and Marcus Smart. Those are my two.
Marcus Smart and Josh Richardson will not be on this team next season. Dennis Schroder too but that's just because he'll get too big of a contract in the offseason
"0-20 at the end of the 3rd quarter. And before you say anything, Marcus Smart was out with an illness."
"Yeah we have two all stars, but literally no supporting cast. It’s actually terrible. Jabari Parker is one of our key bench guys. Grant Williams and Romeo Langford are borderline starters. Marcus Smart is our 3rd best player, and we’re starting two big men who can’t shoot, one of whom is 36. You can say covid decimated us, but we also don’t have 3 of our 6 best players from last season, so it doesn’t necessarily translate to a better record. Throw on all that replacing a top 5-10 coach with a rookie, I don’t see how we should expect more than a couple wins better than last season."
What do you guys think of the Marcus Smart contract? I'm not a fan of it but I don't see him play every game. Is it something that may cripple them in the future?
Not really. Choosing Marcus Smart and Josh Richardson over Evan Fournier should be a fireable offense.
Marcus Smart is if Matisse Thybulle didn't understand his role
Celtics missing their sniper from three Marcus Smart rn
"Raps but it's close  Middleton  Allen-Pierce-KG and it's not particularly close, Giannis probably has a *slight* advantage over 2008 KG but the #2 and #3 aren't really close  Giannis, he's already got about as much in terms of accomplishments as Dirk and he's only 26  Harden and it's not even a little bit close  Dame, we're (theoretically) trying to compete right now and Dame's got at least a few years left in the tank  Shai, he's got playoff experience and his slashing and passing would be huge for us in terms of opening up mismatches for JB and JT  Scottie Barnes. Not even for on-court reasons, I don't want MPJ's antivax ass on my already COVID-battered team lmao  Considering contract, definitely Barnes. Not considering contract, it's a tossup.  Marcus Smart when healthy, but it's been a while since we've seen him able to go 100%. I think he'll recover this season though. On-ball it's pretty even, but when he's giving full effort Smart is one of the best guard team defenders in the league, whereas Dort is just alright at that.  Heat, then Cavs 1.0, then Cavs 2.0, then Lakers"
"A popular predraft comp was Jrue Holiday, but IMO, he's closer to Marcus Smart."
pj tucker/marcus smart type glue guy
Marcus smart brings playmaking to the table and has improved over the years as the celtics go to PG
"Yeah that’s like saying I could average 20 in wilts league. No I’d still circles ran around me, but if you dropped someone like marcus smart in their league he’d be a top player in the league."
Marcus Smart is actually an above average passer. Plus with his defense he’s far from a base level “combo guard”
Marcus Smart  D'Angelo Russell
No its a terrible comment because the Celtics have had players as recently as Marcus Smart talk about racism they have encountered in Boston. It's just a bad look for him to claim this.
Wtf does this have to do with Boston sports?  Ridiculous.  These prima donnas like Kyrie are nothing like the current Celtics team.  He is a malcontent throwing out random jibberish.  Calling Danny Ainge a liar because he is white.  That is racist.  He said hes never seen it. Doubt Marcus Smart ever brought it up to him
"He stated that ""he never heard any of that, from any player."" He never mentioned ""speaking to him personally"" that's you introducing your own assumptions aside from the words that are presented. Marcus Smart was called the n-word and Smart very publically spoke out about the incident to condemn the racism he has experienced. That message was widely broadcasted to the sports world, an audience which includes Ainge especially."
"Then maybe he should think about why if that’s the case, since Marcus Smart very publicly talked about being called the n-word by a Celtics fan"
"Not nearly as naive as your GM, who claims that he has heard about no racism towards your players in his 26 years within the organization, even though Marcus Smart has actually documented it"
"Yeah with that Marcus smart situation it’s because as I’m sad to admit Boston has a lot of racist shitheads.   Similar to AB where he said no one was ever racist to him here, but his brother got it all the time unless he was with AB. There’s tons of racism here. I’m not claiming otherwise. I’m just saying people yell the n word at games extremely rarely. Does that mean it never happens? No. Does it happen at an unacceptable rate? Absolutely. But it’s being presented as if it’s like 50/50 that Kyrie gets the n word shouted at him Friday and that’s just not reality."
"I can explain it to you but it’s up to you to understand that everything that he has done is nowhere close to saying “Boston, as a city, has racist undertones” while playing for the city. That would have taken a severe offense (what happened to Marcus smart) for everyone to be fine with it.  The thing is, racism comes in all different forms. The slow building resentment of a thousand tiny transgressions wouldn’t warrant a media statement, but it can definitely weigh on your mind.  I’m just not gonna tell a dude that he hasn’t experienced racism when he is a black man"
"So you’re saying Marcus Smart, Larry Bird, and Bill Russell are wrong?     This isn’t an either/or.  It’s a both.    Kyrie both deserves criticism and racist fans use that as an excuse to denigrate him as a person.    And from Kyrie’s point of view, he both knows he deserves some criticism and can fucking tell the racists are piling on.    But if you’ve never seen it and players are putting in a newspaper spread to tell you it’s happening, then you’re probably unaware of your own racism.  Because it’s definitely there, we all have some."
"[Marcus Smart](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/marcus-smart-nba-boston-celtics-covid-racial-injustice), or does that not count because it was in the parking lot outside the arena?  We can keep this going if you want to dig in further."
"It took years for Marcus Smart to mention the incident that happened to him.  It's not an excuse, why do you think people would gladly want to talk about being called the n-word or other racist shit when they're just trying to live their lives?"
"There is literally multiple videos, articles, even more articles written by players even Marcus Smart about racism in Boston yet this is your comment?   That you think racism doesn’t exist in Boston?"
No man that was Milton Schwartz definitely not the Celtic player Marcus Smart.
Didn’t Marcus smart say he dealt with it?
"&gt;	 • Arbitrarily determined time frame even if it's meaningful if true. Is a 37 point quarter necessarily hotter than 13 points in 33 seconds or 8 points in 9 seconds or 81 in a game?  &gt;	• If 60 points in 29 minutes make him the 2nd best shooter of all time, does that make Gilbert Arenas (46 points in 30 mins) or J.R. Smith (45 points in 30 mins) better shooters than Larry Bird/Ray Allen/Reggie Miller?  &gt;	• If setting the record for 3s in a playoff game makes him the 2nd best shooter of all time, does that make Ray Allen (10 3s in a playoff game) a better shooter than Stephen Curry?  OP saying things like this is literally nephew takes you’ll find on r/nba, just more words. It’s like saying Marcus Smart is a better shooter than Ray Allen because he hit 11 threes in a game, something Ray Allen never did."
How did you leave out flop king Marcus Smart
"He had a big game over the weekend in game #1 and got pretty chippy with Utah's players on the sidelines. Did a lot of talking when he would score, played tough, physical defense, got underneath other peoples' skin. Basically he did the Marcus Smart thing and now Utah has a grudge against him for it."
Did Russ hurt himself trying to draw a charge lol  I swear that happened to Marcus Smart before
Don’t want to hear it. Quickly flopped like Marcus smart with no contact
