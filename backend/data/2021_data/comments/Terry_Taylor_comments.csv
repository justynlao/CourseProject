"&gt; So were the Rockets.   I'd argue otherwise. Full strength Rockets with all-defensive Beverly guarding Steph instead of a 37yo Jason Terry would make it a real series.  &gt; It's not like they got healthy the next year and lost.  It's not like the Warriors weren't down 3-1. Who's to say the Warriors come out the West next year if KD doesn't join? Warriors fans claim they would win the 2016 finals matchups 7/8 times out of ten while brushing off the WCF as a foregone conclusion. All great teams. Curry was not more transcendent than KD.  &gt; Where the fuck in my comment did I ever start the comparison of the two other than they both elevate their teams, which is a fact btw?  What do you expect when you jump into a shitposting session regarding Curry vs. Bron, especially when the person above was implying that which you deny? You step into the fire but deny there was ever smoke?  ---  I don't know what we're arguing anymore about, so let me try to summarize my position. I sense there's a non-trivial portion of this sub that believes Curry is significantly better than Durant and that's indefensible. They try to make that claim based off of Ben Taylor hearsay and unsubstantiated claims based on 'gravity' and 'team impact'. Curry is not a top 10-15 player, especially considering that's where this sub puts Kobe. Therefore, this sub overrates Curry and we will those shifty arguments collapse like a house of cards in the next few seasons.  The salary cap is meant to enforce scarcity and opportunity cost, but that went out the window with the cap spike and KD signing that mainly benefitted one existing contender. Now when normal cap rules apply to Curry, let's see how he fares. If Steph doesn't break past the 2nd round, then his 'dynasty' was predicated on significant luck."
"You are VASTLY overstimating how much those picks are worth. 31st pick int he draft:  2020 Tyrell Terry, Stanford - Dallas Mavericks   2019 Nicolas Claxton, Georgia – Brooklyn Nets   2018 Elie Okobo, France – Phoenix Suns   2017 Frank Jackson, Duke – Charlotte Hornets   2016 Deyonta Davis, Michigan State – Boston Celtics   2015 Cedi Osman, Anadolu Efes – Minnesota Timberwolves   2014 Damien Inglis, France – Milwaukee Bucks   2013 Allen Crabbe, California – Cleveland Cavaliers   2012 Jeff Taylor, Vanderbilt – Charlotte Bobcats"
"&gt;Here's a question, where does Luke rank among the worst coaches in the league if he's not the worst for you? Who and how many are worse than Luke?  Over the past two seasons, he's done more with what he has available than: Scott Brooks, Billy Donovan ( Jim Boylen ), Nate Bjorkgren, Lloyd Pierce, Terry Stotts, Ryan Saunders, Steve Clifford, JB Bickerstaff, and Stan Van Gundy ( in no order ).  I'd put the following coaches on about the same level: Walton, Chris Finch, Taylor Jenkins, Nate McMillian in Indiana, Dwayne Casey, Steve Nash, Brad Stevens last year, James Borrego, Nick Nurse last year, and Gregg Popovich for the last two years.  I recognize that a few of those guys have had better years than their last one, or last couple, but the fact remains that they've been unimpressive lately.  Mark Daigneault and Stephen Silas are graded ""incomplete"" because I don't think their franchises are even trying to win.  I'm not saying that Walton is a great coach, or the best in the league.  But he isn't the worst, nor is he particularly close."
"I don't care at all how much any of these people make, but it's insane to just deny facts here. Stephen A. Smith is one of the biggest five names in sports media. I'm totally on board with Taylor betting on herself. You do you. I like her a lot. I think she's talented, she's pleasant to look at, and comes from the sports world. And all that said, she isn't Steven A. Smith. We'd laugh at Terry Rozier nonstop if he said ""I want to make LeBron James money"" if he turned down a pretty big contract offer. What's the difference?"
Suns could use a Terry Taylor / Daniel Oturu
