I wish the pacers would cut Kelan martin and sign RHJ
"Oh man, this is not worse than the g-league squad we were rolling out last year.  Napier, Okogie, Kelan Martin, Treveon Graham, Jordan Bell, Culver, McLaughlin, Bates-Diop  I’ve definitely enjoyed watching Beasley, DLO, Vando, and Mcdaniels"
they wanna win? Tryhards  also giving kelan martin serious minutes automatically disqualifies you from tryharding

I bloody hope so. Kelan Martin does not need to be on the court unless it's garbage time.

And kelan martin too lmao
Kelan Martin was Oshae Brissett at some point
called Kelan Martin as Oshae Brissett early in the game while breathing intensely in my ear.
Garbage time Kelan Martin is something else
"Really like the Kelan Martin addition, he and Brissett came out of nowhere seemingly but have stepped up"
"That was the whole reason we brought him in! Especially coming from McMillan, who stuck to smaller rotations and didn’t play rookies.   At KP’s press conference he emphasized copying the Raptors style of development by throwing in random guys each week and seeing if they stuck. Hopefully fielding a deep roster each year   Bjorkgren tried that for like one game with Kelan Martin and folded. What a disaster."
"Mirotic's contract with Barcelona was for 6 years and $79 million and he signed it before Covid. Covid is why he took such a big paycut the following year. Not disagreeing with the rest of your points, but I'd still like to know about which exact players somebody's talking about when they're supposedly better than some NBA players. I think the figure is 90-95%, and not necessarily higher than 95%.  I have trouble believing that Mo Bamba would have a good career with Real Madrid, or that James Wiseman would be a whole lot better with Fenerbahce. Here's a short list of Eastern Conference players currently with contracts for 2021-22 who I don't think should be in the NBA:  1. Udonis Haslem  2. Devin Cannady (Magic)  3. Mo Bamba  4. Cassius Winston (Wizards)  5. Nick Richards (Hornets)  6. Sam Merrill (Bucks)  7. Kelan Martin (Pacers)  8. Sekou Doumbouya  9. Cory Joseph  10. Kevin Knox  11. Jabari Parker  12. Paul Reed (Sixers)  13. Sam Dekker  I'm sure there's a few more in there."
"I dont think he is the biggest bust. I just dont agree with your point that being drafted by Timberwolves can affect the development. Especially during last 2 years, we did not really compete so we played a lot of young players on different positions and gave them a lot of chances. Naz Reid, McLaughlin (forgot about him btw), Keita Bates Diop, Kelan Martin came from G-League during Culver’s first season and all of them were better than him. Vanderbilt was in G League last year but finished the season as starter. I agree, sometime for a player is better to be a part of competitive team to develop. But do think that lack of playing time is more beneficial for players like Toppin or Smith (from Phoenix)?   EVERYONE from the players I mentioned has shown progress. Culver is still the same player he was out of college, but with confidence issues. Culver was given time on the court ONLY because he was 6th overall pick, and he played himself out of rotation.  Edit: McDaniels is a good example. Do you think had he stayed in Lakers he would have been better? Im pretty sure he is very happy to be in Timberwolves because he was actually given chances and used them very well, now he is a big part of the core and people dont want to trade him for Simmons."
"Sabonis was an all star last year too  His best run this year was in May though when most of the Pacers other good players died, 23-14-11 shooting 62% is unreal and against OKC he probably would’ve had a historically great game if he wasn’t benched   Brissett, McDermott, Kelan Martin, and Levert had the best runs of their career at that point of the season with Sabonis"
How has Kelan Martin been this season?
"Kelan Martin had the same number of points as the Raptors bench.  The defense has been bad, but the lack of someone who could give them 15 points in a flash off the bench is an issue."
Kelan Martin is the new Jeremy Lamb 😐
Who the fuck is Kelan Martin.
"A few thoughts from the game:  * Bulls looked gassed, especially on the defensive end. Lavine in particular absolutely couldn't stay in front of anyone. Their offense was also stagnant; lots of ISOs and not much ball movement or cutting.  * The Bulls are really thin at the center position, and that showed even more when Vucevic absent. They had to go small for large stretches and Sabonis/Turner were able to operate really effectively in the paint.  * Despite a blowout and his shooting improving, Levert still played the fewest minutes out of the starters and fewer minutes than two bench guys. From watching all the Pacers games so far this year, my best guess is that Carlisle is looking for specific things out of him (probably defense and playmaking) and keeping him on a tight leash, but who knows.  * Daily reminder that Myles Turner is a legit DPOY contender.  * Kelan Martin had a great game offensively (in a tiny role obviously) and defensively. He's been really nice the last couple games."
From a neutral perspective:  &amp;#x200B;  SUPER SURPRISE:  Kelan Martin  - SF on the Pacers  Omer Yutseven - PF on Heat  Jalen McDaniels -PF on Hornets  Franz Wagner - SF on Magic  Malachi Flynn - PG on Raptors  Isiah Jackson - C on Pacers  &amp;#x200B;  NOT SURPRISING:  Scottie Barnes:  Patrick Williams  Mobley  Lu Dort  Tyrese Haliburton  Immanuel Quickley:  Tyrese Maxey
"Suns - it's honestly McGee, although Ayton and Bridges can be close. Pistons - Hami Diallo, even though he doesn't get much playing time. Thunder - Dort lately, but Bazley has the hops no one other on the team has. Wizards - I'd guess Trez, because of his intensity. Cavs - Allen right now, but Mobley can take the crown. Pacers - Isaiah Jackson?? It can't be Kelan Martin or Brogdon, right? Spurs  - Keldon Johnson and it ain't particularly close, even though Lonnie Walker might argue so. Kings - Richaun Holmes. He is a bowling ball. But Harrison Barnes can surprise you with the hops every now and then. Fox can do some mean dunks. Mavs - DFS."
Gotcha. It was really stupid. He tugged on one of our guys' jersey and looked mad. TECH! then another pillow soft one for Kelan Martin. Refs were jittery
The Kelan Martin game like we all expected
