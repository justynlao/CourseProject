I believe we had 1 free spot already.   Waived Len -1 Traded td and Matt - 3 Norm trade - 2 Freddie Gillespie signing - 1  Yea we've got two free spots now.
Don't we have Freddie Gillespie on a 10 day contract now?
"[Freddie Gillespie was a G League standout. Was VERY high on my list for the G League draft and improved throughout the bubble. Great rebounder at 6'9"", a lot of room for continued growth based on how quickly he got better.](https://twitter.com/BlakeMurphyODC/status/1379795296419520517)  Shoutout Blake for getting the Shams mention!!"
I thought Freddie Gillespie too

"Freddie Gillespie, raptors keep finding gems"
These 10 days getting full time contracts is great to see from Raptors fans  Freddie Gillespie (obviously)  ex-raptor Rondae Hollis Jefferson to the Blazer  Raptors 905 guy Alize Johnson to the Nets  and don't forget Oshae Brissett who is making an absolute name for himself with the Pacers
Insightful take. It’s nice to read after the news that RHJ is getting a contract with the Blazers and Raptors doing the same with Freddie Gillespie.
That’s national champion Freddie Gillespie to you please and thanks
Nobody's ready for the Freddie Gillespie-nomenon
Freddie Gillespie  That's a teacher's name
"Toronto's been the 30th best rebounding team all season. Khem Birch and Freddie Gillespie were necessary pickups just for hustle and team rebounding, yet both of them are 6'9. If Toronto can add a true 7'0 centre through the draft or free agency that can actually play then they'll be in a much better spot next year."
Freddie Gillespie
Freddie Gillespie doing what others wont
Freddie Gillespie
"Wrong guy. I was talking about Freddie Gillespie, thus new Freddie. Red Van Vleet is Malachi."
"""*They can't haze you if you lean in and start enjoying it yourself.*"" - Freddie Gillespie"
BFG Big Freddie Gillespie
Freddie Gillespie
"We grabbed Khem Birch and Freddie Gillespie, so ya Baynes is glued to the bench.  And we're not paying him much, and he's on a team option next year so he gone."
Freddie Gillespie sounds like folk singer's name
Who the hell is Freddie Gillespie fr
Freddie Gillespie is legit. Dude was all over the place tonight.
7 for me as well. Freddie Gillespie to George Mikan
"My take away from this game is Freddie Gillespie has some crazy eyes, would not mess with that man."
"**2022 Raptors**  PG- Jalen Suggs, Malachi Flynn   SG- Fred VanVleet, Gary Trent Jr., David Duke   SF- OG Anunoby, Deandre Bembry, Rodney Hood  PF- Pascal Siakam, Jericho Sims   C- Richuan Holmes, Chris Boucher, Freddie Gillespie"

freddie gillespie  which is weird because he was actually fine against NBA talent  you’d think it’d be the other way around
"Freddie fucking Gillespie looked like absolute dog shit every game. Wide open dunks missed, missed floaters, missed layups, butter fingers tryna grab rebounds. Lord have mercy."
"Can only speak for my team, so I'll say Freddie Gillespie. He was a decent Baynes replacement last year, but my god he looked awful in Summer League. He couldn't catch a pass, and when he did, could never finish. Was pretty bad defensively too despite getting a decent number of blocks. Made me very glad we got Achiuwa to be a real backup centre."
You cant be unselfish when Freddie Gillespie is on the court
Damn how many people in your league that you’d have to pick up Freddie Gillespie lmao
After he hit Freddie Gillespie baseline for the 4th time &amp; he fumbled it Scottie was PISSED.
Freddie Gillespie out here running around with oven mitts on. Cost Scottie like 3-4 assists.
Freddie Gillespie unfortunately has stone hands. Should’ve been around 7-8.
"One of the bigs would probably have to get waived or sent to a 3rd team. Raptors would go from no center depth to too many that all kind of fit the same way with Birch and Powell as the two vets, Boucher in their too situationally, and then too many development pieces Precious, Brown, Gillespie as you said. Just too many guys doing the same role. We need 2 vets and one development guy. And idk what Freddie Gillespie’s contract is like but he could be a two-way contract guy. That leaves out Brown  They need to commit to like one guy as a development piece and I’d rather that be Precious.   Much rather have two 2nd rounders than Moses cuh."
"He got absolutely sat down by Freddie Gillespie. Me? I expect that from Freddie G., but some of you may have had other expectations."
Was force feeding Freddie Gillespie all game —- brutal since Freddie G couldn’t hit anything
"Without shoes:  Pascal is 6’8.25”, Chris Boucher is 6’8”, Khem Birch 6’7.5”, Scottie Barnes 6’7”, Freddie Gillespie 6’9”, Dalano Banton 6’7.75”, Precious Achiuwa 6’7.5”, Yuta Watanabe 6’8”, and Sam Dekker 6’7.75”. So most of these guys would end up being 6’9” in shoes, except Scottie Barnes, who’d be 6’8” in shoes, and Freddie Gillespie, who’d be 6’10” in shoes."
"Definitely good value. Any team could use him. Plays smart and within himself, athletic, has shown a bit of range, distributes the ball well, plus defender. He’s not the greatest rebounder though. But he can play a bunch of different schemes defensively and finish plays. Was by far our most competent C all year. Not saying much when Freddie Gillespie was the second best lol."
Birch isn't signed. We literally have Baynes (who will get waived) and Freddie Gillespie who the Raptors signed to a 10 day contract last season.
We picked up Freddie Gillespie from the G-League last season as well and he looks pretty promising as a back up.
" Precious Achiuwa, OG Anunoby, Dalano Banton, Scottie Barnes Khem Birch, Isaac Bonga, Chris Boucher, Sam Dekker, Goran Dragic, Malachi Flynn, Freddie Gillespie, David Johnson, Stanley Johnson, Pascal Siakam, Gary Trent Jr., Fred VanVleetand Yuta Watanabe plus 2 frp for Simmons straight up... who says no?"
"Actually, Precious looked like Freddie Gillespie in the first quarter. I was honestly triggered with Aaron Baynes flashbacks."
Maybe we were all traumatized by having Baynes at our center that anything average (Birch/Gillespie) was considered amazing. It just seems wild that Freddie dropped off so hard. He literally could do no right in SL/preseason.
"If yall wanna know how down bad the raptors were last season, Freddie Gillespie at the 5 was seen as a breath of fresh air for us."
"Yeah, the pipeline has been insane in the last 10 years or so for high level college guys with a lot of draft picks thrown in.  You’ve had Tyus, Tre, and Gary Trent out of Apple valley, Rashad Vaughn, Daniel Oturu, Matthew Hurt (super highly rated prospect but left duke early and is stuck in the G league), Zeke Nnaji, Holmgren and Suggs out of v, JP Macura who was a stud at Xavier, Freddie Gillespie and Kendall Brown out of east ridge, Tyrell Terry, Royce White (who flamed out), McKinley Wright, Jericho Sims. Minnesota has had a 5 star I think every year for the last 10 years.    Lot of good woman players as well most notably Page Beuckers who’s at UConn now"
"i think he's panicking. Possibly in his own head cuz its a new team. Doesnt wanna miss so bad cuz he wants the new guys to like him. Considering it was a swap for lowry, he wants to prove his worth, but is overthinking it.  On a new team you think everyones watching you extra close. More pressure to impress your peers.  He's also just got a bit of butterfingers action going on, freddie gillespie style."
