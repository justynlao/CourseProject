"It was weird because Nickeil Alexander-Walker off the bench had 37pts when Lonzo and Zion were gone, but since then hasn't been much into rhythm to score like that.  Our bench is super inconsistent, even with pros like JJ Redick on it."
We had 1st and 4th last year but we traded 4th (DeAndre Hunter) for 8th (Jaxson Hayes) and 17th (Nickeil Alexander-Walker).

Well I also want to trade Lonzo ha.  The Pels just have too many guards and I want to open minutes for Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Kira Lewis.  Lonzo and JJ make more sense because of their contracts.
"[Article](https://theathletic.com/news/pelicans-jj-redick-trade-76ers-nets-celtics/mIuEEEjnKXQu) &gt;Redick, whose family resides in Brooklyn, is believed to have a strong preference to return to the northeast area. No deal is imminent yet, sources said.  &gt;Redick, 34, is averaging 7.9 points this season. He has been a ""Did Not Play-Coach’s Decision"" in the Pelicans’ past two games. New Orleans has two young, promising guards in Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Kira Lewis who are on the precipice of rotation spots in the crowded backcourt.  &gt;The Athletic reported on Tuesday that teams were placing calls on Redick and Lonzo Ball, and that the Pelicans have shown openness to discussing both in potential packages.  &gt;The NBA has two upcoming dates relating to the March 25 trade deadline:  &gt;Feb. 2: The last day a player can be traded and still be aggregated in a multi-player transaction at the March 25 trade deadline.  &gt;Feb. 6: Most players who signed free-agent contracts in the offseason can begin to be traded."
The only real reason for the Pelicans to trade guards is to get minutes for Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Kira Lewis. Whatever comes back is just salary. Maybe a second if they they’re lucky.
Lol. My general stance is that if we’re going to suck then we might as well do so while figuring out if Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Kira Lewis are any good.  And really Oubre brings entertainment value if not actual value so I’ll call that a win/win.
"The problem is the roster is full of REALLY poor fits. No one respects Zion's shot yet. So far Lonzo has proved last season was a mirage, and due to Ingram's growth they've taken the ball out of his hands which takes away his best skill - but they dont really have choice given Ingram's improvement. Adams is a non-shooter. People don't guard Bledsoe at the 3 point line. That leaves them with... who, exactly, that can shoot? JJ Redick and Ingram? Nickeil Alexander-Walker doesnt get enough PT to count so... yeah. Seems like the starting lineup needs a shakeup at a minimum. But even if Stan does that, not sure it'll matter. Oh and while Adams, Bled and Lonzo are stout defenders a\] that doesnt much matter if you can't get a bucket and there's no spacing on offense, and b\], Zion has been a HUGE disappointment on defense after being very good on that end at Duke. So far. There's plenty of time for that to change of course. But even so... it's just a really flawed roster with lots of flawed young players. They were never going to be any good."
"Brandon and Zion need reliable shooters who can space the floor for them. Zion's grabbing 30 [in a crowded room](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EsMjrnxXYAclbMn?format=jpg&amp;name=large), I think BI looks exhausted by late quarters after driving through like [four guys](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EsJP2jfUwAQuGlx?format=jpg&amp;name=large) at a time all game.  People just don't see Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, or Eric Bledsoe as threats and they feel free to leave them unguarded and go crowd the #1 guys.  During the Lakers game, Schroder guarded the shit outta Nickeil Alexander-Walker though because he'd had a 37pt game against the Clips. I think Nickeil could be a good starter for us at SG if they let him get minutes.  BI and Zion are actually pretty good at creating looks for others, and our rookie PG seems pretty good at creating looks too. Just need dudes to stop bricking 'em."

"LEBRON JAMES' ARRIVAL in July 2018 upended Ingram's role, as it did for every Laker. Ingram would play more off the ball. The Davis trade rumors overwhelmed the team starting in December. Ingram knew he would be part of any Davis deal. Even so, he averaged 18 points before the discovery of a blood clot in his right arm ended his season in March 2019.  ""The [trade rumors] were tough on him,"" said Josh Hart, Ingram's teammate in both L.A. and New Orleans. ""Before LeBron got there, he had been given the keys. And then people in L.A. were killing him: He's not as good anymore. He's not a great No 2. pick. The rumors became part of our lives, all year. Thank god I don't have to deal with that s--- anymore.""  Ingram and Stackhouse discussed how Ingram might fit in New Orleans months before the trade. When it happened, Stackhouse predicted Ingram would excel. ""You're in a place that fits you -- more similar to where you grew up,"" Stackhouse said. ""He was collateral damage, but in a good way. I was ecstatic.""  Ingram's father feels no resentment toward the Lakers, or regret about his son's path.  ""If we went back to draft day, I wouldn't have it any other way,"" Donald Ingram said. ""The L.A. experience helped him become a man.""  On Ingram's first day in New Orleans, Fred Vinson, an assistant with expertise in shooting mechanics, introduced himself and went right into a lecture. He said he knew Ingram was entering a contract year, and warned the organization would hold his poor shooting -- about 33% on 3s, 66% at the line -- against him. Vinson said he would be in the Pelicans' gym the next morning if Ingram wished to work.  Ingram showed up. Vinson told Ingram he was pointing his right foot inward upon his release, sapping power from his legs and throwing his body out of alignment -- another voice offering to repair Ingram's game. Vinson slapped tape onto the floor and would not let Ingram shoot unless his toes were straight across the tape. Vinson stood behind Ingram, reaching his arms up, warning Ingram not to bring the ball back so far as to hit him.  Ingram and the other young players then left for some summer time away from the team. He asked Vinson for notes and drills to do. Vinson emailed them.  When Ingram returned in September 2019, his jumper looked so good, Vinson pulled aside Trajan Langdon, the Pelicans' GM, and asked if Ingram had played some sort of trick on him, officials recalled.  On road trips, Ingram asked Vinson to arrange for a gym to be ready for him to shoot when the Pelicans landed. Ball started joining them. In 5-on-5 portions of practice, Ingram sometimes refuses to be subbed out. ""He'll tell me to f--- off and get someone else,"" Hart said.  Ingram tripled his 3-point attempts last season. He hit 39% from deep, and 85% at the line. Vinson wants more: at least seven 3s per game, and more pull-up 3s. Ingram is 12-of-33 on pull-up triples after making just 19 last season. If that becomes a reliable shot, there will be no foolproof scheme for Ingram on the pick-and-roll.  It would help to get Ingram the ball on the move so he is not operating from a standstill. That has been slow going, as Ingram and new teammates hammer out timing. ""He's still a slight player,"" Griffin said. ""If he gets the ball at a dead stop, it doesn't take a lot to keep him from getting momentum.""  Ingram has a nascent post game for use when smaller guys switch onto him, though he needs more force there, too. His defense has improved, in part because the Pelicans have him guarding wings instead of power forwards who can bulldoze him.  Two weeks ago, Stackhouse texted Ingram after one game and suggested he could get lower in his stance. Ingram replied that he agreed, even if he will always be more of an upright defender who makes up ground with length and speed. The Pelicans are on Ingram to stop peeking behind for oncoming screens, and to always find someone to box out.  Quiet by nature, Ingram is easing into a leadership role after showing deference to Jrue Holiday last season. Another 3-on-3 game with special rules required Ingram to shout the name of every teammate he passed to -- a method of bringing out his voice.  ""It helped me get comfortable,"" Ingram said.  Ingram is popular in the locker room, and coaches last season began using him as a conduit to deliver messages to Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Jaxson Hayes, and other young players. If they heard it from Ingram, it might carry more weight.  A more outgoing Ingram said he might one day accept more endorsements. His representatives wish he would. ""He's got a beautiful smile, but he's not about that stuff,"" Stackhouse said. ""He just wants to hoop.""  There is still a huge gap between the present and where Ingram thinks he and New Orleans can go one day. Other confidantes have heard Ingram state similarly lofty goals to the one he once told Redick. ""It's almost eerie to hear a kid say, 'I want to be the best ever,'"" Stackhouse said.  The Pelicans are 5-7, their roster a bit of a mish-mash. But Ingram's belief is unwavering.  ""I know,"" Ingram said, ""that we are building something special here."""
"You nailed this exactly.  I feel like we can't even get to the BI/Zion possible issues because our shooting/shot creation is so abysmal.  Brandon Ingram is great as a ball-dominant player that sometimes leads the charge. That works just fine with Zion. He needs a secondary playmaker who will give him the ball though because he's also a great shooter, and so we need a point guard who can initiate offense and break up defenses.  Zion is still growing on defense, but he's a handful of trouble in the paint and once he picks up more shooting, he's gonna be a tough fucking guy to stop.  They both need a lot of space/a lot of paint and you can take turns running the offense through them. They can still give each other breaks against certain teams with their skillsets, and I think that's a good thing.  But right now, teams don't feel the need to guard anyone else. I've seen guys pay attention to Nickeil Alexander-Walker when he's on the court since his 37pt game, but most defenders can just flatout ignore Bledsoe, Josh, Lonzo, and sometimes even J.J., because Brandon and Zion are way more of a threat."
"Hmm, I think Graham is just better and has another year on his contract. In a vacuum yeah I’d trade Lonzo for Graham. But ideally a Lonzo trade opens up the rotation for Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Kira Lewis."
Don’t forget about Nickeil Alexander-Walker either. These guys have so much potential.
"I might go with Dwight Powell over Brandon Clarke. Plus Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Khem Birch, Dillon Brooks, Trey Lyles, Karim Mane, Mychal Mulder off the bench"
"He still went up against people like Tyler Herro, PJ Washington, Rui, Tacko, Cam Johnson, nickeil Alexander walker, etc etc. It's not like he only played against nobodies."
"All-Canada Team is nasty.  * **PG**: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Luguentz Dort, Cory Joseph * **SG**: Jamal Murray, RJ Barrett, Nickeil Alexander-Walker * **SF**: Andrew Wiggins, Dillon Brooks, Trey Lyles * **PF**: Chris Boucher, Brandon Clarke, Khem Birch * **C**: Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, Dwight Powell"
"Canada has three streaks of 3peats:  * Bill Wennington '96-'98 (2nd Bulls 3peat) * Rick Fox '00-'02 (Lakers 3peat) * Joel Anthony '12-'13 (Heatles) + Cory Joseph '14 (Spurs)  With the number of quality Canadian NBA players increasing, it seems likely that there will eventually be a longer streak: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jamal Murray are legit stars, RJ Barrett still might become a good player if he escapes NY before he gets too much Knicks stank on him, Andrew Wiggins is finally showing some signs of life on defense with Draymond kicking his butt in Golden State, and there are a ton of solid role players that could easily find a roster spot on a championship team: Chris Boucher (2 chips already), Lu Dort, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Cory Joseph (1), Kelly Olynyk, Tristan Thompson (1), Trey Lyles, Brandon Clarke, Dillon Brooks, Dwight Powell. Marcus Carr is coming, too, and there are a number of other current NCAA prospects."
Nickeil Alexander-Walker (I think that’s how you spell it) he’s Shai’s brother
Nickeil Alexander-Walker. One of the longest names in the NBA so hopefully NAW catches on just to save typing time.
Nickeil Alexander-Walker.... literally everyone calls him NAW because of how long his name is
"Bledsoe has been the only guy besides BI that can consistently drive the paint from the perimeter (he's also shooting 37% from 3). To me there is another guy who shall remain nameless who is shooting 30% from 3 and has no ability to drive the ball who creates more issues. And also no bench guard capable of creation (unless Nickeil Alexander Walker is real, but that's a recent development)."

nickeil alexander-walker honorary revenge game
"Okay let me make sure to type out Kentavious Caldwell Pope, Nickeil Alexander Walker, and Talen Horton Tucker in every comment just for you"
yeah but come on we literally can look up [2017 Lonzo rookie highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtnQjJCdYd8) and he was dishing everywhere.  I love Lamelo and personally think he will be great.  Just wait til players like Marcus Smart are on him and not Kevin Huerter and Nickeil Alexander Walker
"Jerome Robinson, Ty Jerome, Nickeil Alexander Walker of those who still have chance to turn it around  Ante Zizic, Trey Lyles, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson of those who probably lost chance to turn it around  Dion Waiters, Michael Carter-Williams, Tyreke Evans and Michael Beasley of those who most definitely wasted their chances"
"Wait, can you guys link me to the player initials thing? I'm guessing it's because some people are using initials for random players on teams and the average user doesn't know who tf they're talking about?  For me that was when someone posted NAW last year or something for Nickeil Alexander-Walker. I was like HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHO THAT IS lmao  tbh though BI is his actual nickname, it's like KD. There are no other players that go by BI. Everyone just needs to use it."
Nickeil Alexander-Walker
He might be scared after his bad shooting night last night. We kinda need him to go for it though. Esp. with Ingram/Nickeil Alexander-Walker out
"Yeah, people always talking about Lu Dort, another Canuck, but Brooks is another killer defender who seems at times like he could make a jump on offense, and at least tighten up his 3 and be a real contributor on a contender  After the disappointing passivity of dudes like Wiggins and Bennett, Canada has a whole bunch of bad mfs coming out.  Jamaal Murray, Brooks, dort  + Up and coming SGA,Rj barrett, chris Boucher, khem birch, Brandon Clarke, Nickeil Alexander Walker  + veterans like Olynyk, Tristan Thompson, Corey Joseph, Dwight Powell,  Hopefully can run for a silver at next international"
Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Jaxson Hayes and Kira Lewis Jr all made some strides but then *also* promptly got injured.  I felt like we were really starting to turn a corner post-ASG and post-Minny loss too. Now everyone's just injured and we're trying to scrape by with new vets and.... Eric Bledsoe.
"The answer is somewhat complicated, but the answer is basically: Brandon Ingram, Zion Williamson, Nickeil Alexander Walker, Kira Lewis Jr."

"Everyone treats Haliburton like he's an elder rookie, it's bizarre to me. Like he's a low ceiling kind of guy coming out of 4 years at college. He was basically dead average in terms of age of rookies drafted, but the 1st round skews a little younger.  People always bring up Malcolm Brogdon which *kind of* makes sense in play style, but there's always an ""old rookie"" subtext to it. Haliburton at his debut was over 3 years younger than Brodgon at his debut.   Some previous rookies who were treated as young guys with high potential that were actually older than Haliburton when they were drafted: PJ Washington, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Josh Jackson, Robert Williams"
&gt; he drafted Jaxson Hayes and Nickeil Alexander-Walker  lmfaooooo
"They will make playoffs, he drafted Jaxson Hayes and Nickeil Alexander-Walker, the team looks good."
Hart is a much better defender. It’s not close.  NAW is Nickeil Alexander-Walker.

is Nickeil Alexander-Walker the greatest three name player in nba history?
Nickeil Alexander Walker Texas Ranger
not a single reason lol  We were begging them to give Nickeil Alexander-Walker or Josh Hart more of his minutes all year then they got injured
"&gt;Zions teammates mostly suck  We're also stubbornly playing Bledsoe  No reason NAW didn't get the start over Bled months ago. This team is giving him all the mins for some reason  It's a dude chucking the ball into space on posessions, and it makes no sense  esp because Nickeil Alexander-Walker seems legitimately good and was playing great with starting mins before he got injured (and teams actually guarded him)"
"They have no idea what they're doing on team defense.  \- They need regular practices to get things down because Zion/BI are both ball-watching, rotating wrong, and then wasting energy on long close-outs on shooters.  \- more shooting. not crazy expensive guys either but Melli/Redick/Lonzo all hit a horrible shooting slump and we were just completely without any reliable shooting majority of this season. We picked up *another* guy and he hit 0 of his open shots. (Nunnally.)   We need just a reliable guy we can ask to c+s on easy open looks.  \- Cut Bledsoe, start Nickeil Alexander-Walker. He's more than earned the start already.  \- Develop more. BI and Zion have finally had their first season playing together and while their defense is struggling, the offensive rating has been very good when our guys were healthy. We were finding our rhythm then Josh Hart/Nickeil went out.  When our backcourt is reliably hitting wide-open looks, we should be able to help Zion/BI exert less energy on generating offense and it'll help *(along with regular defensive practices*) on defense.  Zion and Ingram are very very good. We just need to get reliable/consistent help from the roleplayers around them."
"It's a mix of things.  If the shot isn't falling, has trouble getting FTs. He really only drives in the rare fastbreak situation, and sometimes when he gets fouled there's no call because he has no reputation as a slasher. Refs are weird. It's easy to block/foul him because of that. Meanwhile, Eric Bledsoe can't finish at all lately, but he can get the whistle/get easy points that way.  He's been coming off of injuries a lot this season (knees, now hips) and when he does, it's difficult for him to get back into shooting flow. So then it's ""0-5pt"" games. And that's sometimes weeks and weeks of inconsistency. Which sucks. Our backcourt isn't contributing, and then Zion and Brandon are left on an island.  *And then you have...*  Eric Bledsoe and Lonzo Ball have similar issues with confidence/being consistent and I don't think they bring out the best in each other.  It's why I was begging them to play Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Kira Lewis Jr. more in Lonzo Ball line-ups. (And to start NAW.) NAW is more reliable offensively than Bledsoe, and Kira Lewis Jr. is a very good cutter and a fast rookie who helps your point guard get more eyes off of your star players. They're offensive threats and dudes you can swing the ball to, vs. Bled. (Who is left unguarded by other teams *a lot*.)  But, the roster this year wasn't built to help *anyone*. It hurts our star players the most---which is the most important part, but it sure as hell doesn't help the dudes like Lonzo, Josh in the line-up either."
"I think he has; how many guys taken after Garland would you take over him? The only ones with a case are Coby White, Rui Hachimura, Cam Johnson, PJ Washington, Tyler Herro, Chuma Okeke, Nickeil Alexander Walker, Matisse Thybulle, Brandon Clarke, and Lu Dort. I'd personally take Garland over all those guys except maybe Dort."
"It's not intentional. Which is why it's so maddening  I'm just hoping with a real offseason + training camp + practices we can start fixing some of our issues. We're so damn sloppy. We couldn't 'guard a parked car.'  Zion doesn't know what a defensive stance is or how to close out. BI constantly loses his man.  Lonzo forgets that his team needs him to generate points. Bledsoe forgot how to play basketball. Adams I don't even know because everyone around him is so lost on team defense, he's often just left on an island.  And we're not playing Kira Lewis Jr. and letting him get minutes even though he's been promising, and we weren't playing a healthy Nickeil Alexander-Walker, even though NAW was putting up these great 30pt/20pt games and being a *great* SG for us."
"Maybe see what we have with Nickeil Alexander-Walker. Especially in the starting line-up. He's young and has shown out a few times. Ambidextrous finisher, can shoot threes, hit mid-range shots, stepbacks, can be a multi-level scorer and pest on defense at times.  I don't think they'll throw our rookie Kira Lewis Jr. in the fire just yet, but he's crazy fast and seems pretty smart for a rookie. He needs to get to NBA weight and keep learning off the bench probably.  They'll both get more minutes if Bledsoe is gone from the team.  Do we run things back with Josh Hart and Lonzo Ball though?   And please for the love of god sign some shooters who will actually show up and shoot and not drop to 20% when they join the Pelicans.  🙏📿"
"I'd rather start Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Kira Lewis Jr., Josh Hart, and even Naji Marshall our two-way player over Bledsoe."
When Nickeil Alexander-Walker was healthy we could have started him. (Has done GREAT with starter minutes) but instead..... :(
Our guards have put up 0pts. Happened last game too... and I can't use the 'our starters are out' excuse this time. Only missing Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Josh Hart now.
"Missing a lot of our usual roster right now (Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Josh Hart, Lonzo Ball.)   Our newer guys haven't played with the team before and look a little confused about where to go when Zion gets doubled rn."
"PG: Shai, Corey Joseph  SG: RJ, Nickeil Alexander-Walker  SF: Wiggins, Dort, Dillon Brooks  PF: Olynk, Boucher, Brandon Clarke, Dwight Powell, Trey Lyles  C: TT, Khem Birch  7 of those guys play starter minutes. Even if say TT or Dwight Powell don't make it because they're deep in the playoffs, I have no doubt they can beat a Enes Kanter-less Turkey (likely without Ilyasova and Furkan as well) or Giannis-less Greece and no doubt they can beat China or Czech Republic..  With the Olympic games itself I think that team can legitimately get a medal.."
"Among those who accepted the camp invitations: Golden State’s Andrew Wiggins, New York’s RJ Barrett, Memphis’ Dillon Brooks, Oklahoma City’s Luguentz Dort, Houston’s Kelly Olynyk, New Orleans’ Nickeil Walker-Alexander, and Indiana’s Oshae Brissett.  For some, like Barrett and Brooks, availability will obviously hinge on how far their teams advance in the NBA playoffs.  “There is no greater feeling in sports than the chance to represent your country on the highest international stage at the Olympic Games,” Canada senior men’s program general manager Rowan Barrett said. “Our players and staff fully recognize the unique opportunity that lies ahead of us and I would like to commend them for their dedication to playing for Canada this summer.”     Let's go"
"Oh yea, I mean look at these NBA lineups for last 2 months:  PG: Jamal Murray (21.2 pts/4 rbs/4.8 ats per game)  SG: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (23.7 pts/4.8 rbs/5.9 ats per game)  SF: Luguentz Dort (19.5 pts/4.4 rbs/2.2 ats per game)  PF: Chris Boucher (14.1 pts/6.7 rbs/1.1 ats per game)  C: Kelly Olynyk (19.1 pts/8.6 rbs/4.2 ats per game)  Bench:   PG: Cory Jospeh  SG: RJ Barrett  SF: Andrew Wiggins  PF: Dwight Powell  C: Khem Birch  Super-bench:  PG: Nickeil Alexander-Walker  SG: Trey Lyles  SF: Dillon Brooks  PF:  Dwight Powell  C: Tristan Thompson"
Whats even crazier is that everyone from the TOTAL FG MADE FROM BEYOND HALF-COURT LINE made 1 when they only attempt 1 except Nickeil Alexander-Walker wtf

"Not too late for them to get in on Dame either. And in both the Harden or Dame sweepstakes I wouldve/am still willing to offer Ingram.

Nickeil Alexander-Walker? Kinda proud of myself for this one

I do watch the team. I know they have the worst spacing in the league. I know it’s not controversial to say I’d rather have DeAndre Hunter or Darius Garland over Jaxson hayes and Nickeil Alexander-Walker.
"Yeah wow, if you look at the top 9 of that draft, the only misses are Culver and Hayes. That’s impressive, to trade down and miss like that. They could’ve had Garland but you know, another non-shooting big is what you need on Zion’s team. All for pretty much just Nickeil Alexander-Walker."

"Cannot believe this man threw Nickeil Alexander-Walker under the bus like that, man"
More Nickeil Alexander-Walker please and thank you senor Nurse
"Nickeil ""Shai Gilgeous"" Alexander Walker"
Nickeil Alexander Walker the best player on Canada
"Pelicans only because they cant get worse than what they are rn. They have a bunch of picks, young star(Brandon Ingram) other young players(S&amp;T Lonzo Ball, Jaxson Hayes, Nickeil Alexander-Walker) to trade for Dame. Dame + Zion a better duo than Ingram-Zion."
RJ Barrett and Nickeil Alexander-Walker
"Canada has Wiggins, RJ Barrett, Cory Joseph, Dwight Powell, Lu Dort, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Trey Lyles, Mychal Mulder, and home court so it will be tough for Turkey to qualify, but should be a good tourney with Greece and China also having decent teams."
"“What he’s doing” DG doesn’t need anyone defending him, but he’s got as many hits as he does misses. It doesn’t help the misses - Bledsoe and Adams - are his most costly. But other than Zion, he drafted Jaxon Hayes and Nickeil Alexander-Walker, and both showed some promise and potential as bench contributors. Kira Lewis can be electric as well. The trades with the Lakers and Bucks both were net positives for the team. Brandon Ingram still has room to grow and could be a great compliment to Zion. What they end up doing with Lonzo will be fascinating and arguably his biggest non-coaching move. He’s worth keeping around, but only at a certain price. Cutting George Hill instead of Bledsoe was a bad move, and signing Adams to that contact only made sense with SVG as head coach. He’ll now have to unload some of their draft capital to get anything of value in return for Bledsoe and Adams which is unfortunate. And the hiring of SVG wasn’t great either. Yes, they needed defensive improvement, but there are plenty of individuals that are qualified that could connect to the team a lot better.  Tl;dr DG’s misses have been more costly, but he’s still had more hits overall."

"This is basically their depth chart now right?  Devonte' Graham / Tomas Satoransky / Kira Lewis  Nickeil Alexander-Walker / Josh Hart  Brandon Ingram / Garrett Temple / Trey Murphy  Zion Williamson / Wenyen Gabriel  Jonas Valanciunas / Jaxson Hayes / Willy Hernangómez  They could be a play in team but their defense is probably going to be terrible again this next year and their bench is not good. They'll need to have like a top 3 offense to be a decent team.  Considering they have a dude averaging 27 PPG on great efficiency making 10M/year, probably being a below average team in their conference is pretty bad imo."
"If everybody is healthy and chooses to play for you guys you would be silver medal favorites imo with a chance of upsetting USA for gold.  You’ve got Murray/SGA/Brooks/Wiggins/Olynyk   Then Cory Joseph/Dort/RJ/Boucher/Birch  And that’s still leaving off some solid guys like Tristan Thompson, Trey Lyles, Dwight Powell, Oshae Brisset, and Nickeil Alexander-Walker  That’s a lot of talent, and if they commit to the three year plan then they’re for sure strong contenders"

"Nickeil Alexander-Walker.  Pelicans got rid of Lonzo Ball to start this guy. Three-level scorer, great driver, good playmaker and passer, tremendous hard-working defender. Has been turnover-prone and a little shot-happy, IMO because he's been trying to do too much in limited playing time.  Now that the Pelicans have cleared a starting space for him, and he doesn't have to force his game – watch out."
Nickeil Alexander-Walker
"* I could see Malik Beasley hit 25ppg with everyone on the Wolves healthy.  * Derrick White could have had a breakout season last year but couldn't get healthy.   * Jalen Brunson is really good, but maybe we won't see him flourish until he leaves the Mavs.  * Maybe not MIP, but TJ Warren will have another excellent and totally ignored season. 20ppg on 60 TS%.  * Nickeil Alexander Walker will have some massive games, but struggle with consistency.  * If we are allowed sophmores, I think Haliburton and Patrick Williams will have big leaps. Maybe Aaron Nesmith and Devin Vassell."
Nickeil Alexander-Walker balled out for Canada and should be starting for us this year. He averaged 18/5/3 when he was getting starter minutes last year.
"&gt;*honestly, the Pelicans feel like they're behind even us in roster development.*  Maybe a little bit.  Last season Coach Stan Van Gundy refused to play our younger players. He gave out a LOT of DNPs lol.  Eric Bledsoe was our most played player last season despite the fact that he hasn't acted---nor put the effort in, of an All-Defense caliber guard for majority of the season. He was terrible on both sides of the ball while our younger guys were actually pretty responsible/hard-working.  He really only wanted to play vets, and it drove the fanbase (and FO) crazy.  Because we do have young promising guys on the team that our FO *really likes*, but that didn't get to see the floor and work through their mistakes and grow from them. Jaxson Hayes, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, didn't get a lot of playtime but especially our youngest rookie Kira Lewis Jr. lol. He only gave them minutes when he was forced to because of injuries."
"Jrue and Lowry are nowhere near the exact same type of player beyond both being guards and good defenders. First, as much as I love Jrue, Lowry is better. Second, Jrue is a combo guard who can play the point but isn’t a natural point guard while Lowry is more of a pure point guard. Third, their leadership styles are incredibly different: Lowry is a far more vocal leader on and off the court than Jrue ever was.  If you think Lonzo is 1. a guard and 2. can facilitate on the court outside of transition you have not watched the Pelicans for the past two years. The only thing he was “getting better” at was shooting open 3s. He still can’t drive to the rim and he can’t initiate an offense. His athleticism is useless because he doesn’t use it to bully people, get to the rim, or make plays. His on-ball defense is overrated because he can’t fight through screens, although he’s very good at reading passing lanes. I promise that Lonzo isn’t as good as people think he is.  It’s also wrong to view Graham as the Lonzo replacement. Nickeil Alexander-Walker is the Lonzo replacement; Graham is the Bledsoe replacement"
I haven't been this impressed by a SG in summer league since Nickeil Alexander Walker
"Terance Mann, Nickeil Walker-Alexander, Rui Hachimura (he’s gonna be amazing tbh), De’Andre Hunter, Lonnie Walker, Cole Anthony, Patrick Williams, And Jaren Jackson Jr (I already think he’s good but he’s going to put people on notice)."
Kelly Olynyk IF they start him Kevin Porter and KJ Martin Oshae Brissett Jaden McDaniels Nic Claxton Tyrese Haliburton and Chimezu Metu Devin Vassell  Nickeil Walker Alexander Robert Williams
"Cam Reddish  Romeo Langford or Aaron Nesmith (probably just one of those 2)  Darius Garland (maybe he's too good or obvious for that list)  PJ Dozier  Malik Monk  Jaren Jackson Jr. (think this is the year he turns it around)  Tyrese Maxey  Kira Lewis or Nickeil Alexander Walker (same as the Boston guys, not sure they can both breakout at the same time)  Malachi Flynn"
Nickeil Alexander-Walker for the Pelicans
"Shai and his cousin, Nickeil Alexander Walker played high school ball in my hometown in TN. They were recruited down here."
Nickeil Alexander-walker.  He is ready for a break out
Nickeil Alexander Walker  no homer bias to be found here

"Nickeil Alexander Walker  he’d average 30. might take 30 shots to get it, but he won’t stop shooting."
Devonte Graham and nickeil Alexander Walker?  An above average second unit and concerning first unit
Nickeil Alexander Walker
"By the way, Zion was forced to sit that game out. So Nickeil and Brandon Ingram were the Pels' only scorers during that game. In the second half, Kawhi Leonard and Paul George took turns trying to stop NAW. Didn't happen.  Alexander-Walker is so, so, so much better than the player he's replacing (hint: now a 3&amp;D wing in Chicago)."
"Coaches: Willie Green, Mike D'Antoni  Center: Jonas Valanciunas  FC: Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram  BC: Devonte Graham, Nickeil Alexander-Walker  NO Bledsoe, Adams, Lonzo  Still moves to be made too... it's looking a WHOLE lot better than last year  P.S. fuck r/nba"
"Sure. I mean, the thing about defense is our defense was bad with or without Lonzo. He gets lost on screens a lot because he's not the best on ball defender. He's a good help defender but when the rest of the team is bad defensively that has no impact.  Our defense is going to live and die by Ingram and Zion stepping up on defense, not whether Lonzo is still on the team. As we've seen with many, many teams, your point guard's defense isn't that important. Your bigs and wings? That's the kicker. JV is a fine defender if not an elite shotblocker or anything, but Ingram and Zion need to be better at reading offensive attacks for anything to matter.  Nickeil Alexander Walker is going to be our better guard defender coming up this year and he's pretty solid on defense, anyhow. Made a big jump from this past year on the defensive end and offensive end so there shouldn't be a big drop of there.  Graham has the length and speed to defend other point guards but beyond that he'd be hopeless.  So yeah, it comes down to Zion and Ingram."
"Trying to get some karma from the anti-Pelicans circle jerk? I won't be surprised if they sign Reggie Jackson or Schroeder, but even if not their offseason hasn't been terrible. They messed up with the Adams and Bledsoe moves last year but managed to unload them and bring back Valanciunas which was a pretty solid deal. Nickeil Alexander Walker and Kira Lewis are guards with potential who could play more minutes, and Graham is a solid bench scorer. Satoransky is a decent distributor and gives them some height on the perimeter. It's yet to be determined if Lonzo is worth 21 mil so we'll have to wait and see, but they have a pretty solid young core, and drafted Trey Murphy III who is a smart player with a lot of upside."
"Depends on how high you are on certain Canadian talents.   1. Will Shai and Murray continue their growth and become perennial all-stars?  2. Is Nickeil Alexander Walker just a fine bench guard or will he develop into a reliable starter in New Orleans? 3. Is RJ Barrett just a solid player or will he make the leap and be viewed alongside Ja and Zion?  4. Will a reliable big man emerge than go toe to toe with Gobert, Bam, Jokic, etc.   If all of those answers are no, Canada won't likely medal.   If 2-3 of those situations go right, Canada could absolutely challenge for bronze and in some years silver.  If all 4 go in Canada's favor PLUS a current Canadian high schooler develops into a major NBA superstar, they could challenge for silver/gold."
"Are we sure multiple teams wanted Ball, though? The Ball buzz at the trade deadline was only about the Bulls, and clearly the Bulls were the only ones making a big offer now in free agency. (Pretty clear inference from the deal being done in the first minute of free agency; and probably also why the Pels got so little in the S&amp;T. If other teams were competing for Ball, the Bulls probably have to give up more for him.)  And can I point out that every other move by the Bulls was a grotesque overpay for a mediocre one-dimensional player? They're building around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan as well as Ball - and gave up the farm to do so. There is very little evidence the current Bulls front office knows what they're doing.  Re: the Anthony Davis heist, the Pels still have an age-22 All-Star in Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, Jaxson Hayes, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Didi Louzada, two R1 picks, and two R1 pick swaps from that. They're doing OK there."
These people who only see Lonzo Ball's highlights have no idea that replacing Ball with nothing is a big win for the Pelicans. Addition by subtraction. There is literally nothing Ball does on a court that Nickeil Alexander-Walker doesn't do better.  Adding Devonte' Graham is just icing on the cake.
Ball isn’t a point guard. He didn’t play point for the Pels last season. Graham is a massive upgrade over Eric Bledsoe. JV is an upgrade over Adams.   The Pels viewed Lonzo as a kinda wing. He’s a off-ball guy. I think they are right in thinking this. If you wanna talk about replacing ball I think Nickeil Alexander-Walker is more the replacement in mind for the team.
Nickeil Alexander-Walker should finally be starting for New Orleans and looked really impressive this summer for Team Canada. He should have a great year.
"DiVincenzo is the clear outlier there. He seems like a pretty clear solid contributor in the NBA, at a minimum. Maybe he'll grow into more. But his absence also didn't prevent them from winning the title, obviously.   We'll see about Nickeil Alexander-Walker. He grades as a replacement-level player at this point. Maybe I'll be wrong, but if he's starting for NOP, I'm guessing they've taken a substantial step backwards."
"Why even try then? Pelicans pick 17th in the 1st round this year. The last 4 guys picked 17th are:  Aleksej Pokusevski, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Donte DiVincenzo, D.J. Wilson  Most of those guys are worthless, and none of them move the needle much. So let's sell the 17th pick for no assets in return, too."
Hyphenated last names are the new market inequality.  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Talen Horton-Tucker  Keita Bates-Diop  Nickeil Alexander-Walker  Wardell Stephen James-Curry
"NAW  Edit: To clarify, Nickeil Alexander-Walker"
"10 . New Orleans Pelicans Josh Giddey | 6-8 wing | 18 years old | Adelaide The player: Giddey had a terrific season in Australia, averaging 11 points, seven rebounds and seven assists, leading the league in helpers and finishing sixth in rebounding as an 18-year-old. He needs to tighten up his handle a bit and keep improving as a shooter, but the skill set here is perfect for that of a secondary playmaker at the next level due to how quickly he processes the game. Giddey should be a very high-level role player who starts, with some upside for more if the jumper gets figured out.  The fit: I have less of a feel for the Pelicans than any other team in the top 10. They have a tendency to draft younger (Kira Lewis, Zion Williamson and Jaxson Hayes were all teenagers when they were picked, and Nickeil Alexander-Walker was 20 years old) under this regime. Plus, their backcourt of the future could use a bit more size. I’ve gone Giddey here, who would be a pretty great replacement for Lonzo Ball, given that Ball is a free agent and no guarantee to re-sign in New Orleans. One other note on Giddey: he has a lot of fans in ranges of the draft that aren’t his projected range, including Toronto — one of the few teams to send personnel to see him live this year in Australia. Don’t be surprised to see a team target him in a trade situation."
&gt;plus a starting backcourt of Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Kira Lewis.  This sounds like a joke 😂. They're stupid if they don't bring back Lonzo if that's the case
"&gt;If it’s insane, then as previously stated it’s insane to expect that same guy to be able to perform for a team trying to make the playoffs in the western conference.  You’re contradicting yourself.   &gt;There core is Zion and Ingram and they’re still high on Kira, NAW and I’m sure would like to bring back Lonzo. Kispert’s skill set isn’t so unique that you have to grab him. Of course he would be on his rookie deal, but you’re also with the uncertainty that he may not work. It’s not like a shooter on the market is gonna be requesting max money.  Once again there is uncertainty that every single player to ever exist may not work. That is a flawed argument that makes completely 0 sense.   &gt;Of course other rookies have done it, but if you’re New Orleans in the western conference it’s incredibly unrealistic to expect that from Kispert his rookie year.   It’s unrealistic to expect a 4 year college player that was a good shooter to be a good shooter?   &gt;Again guys like Tatum, Mitchell were the exception.  Again when I brought up Tatum I was specifically highlighting his contribution to winning as a rookie. Not his post season play, not his stardom, not even him being a starter and playing 30 minutes a game. I literally put in parentheses “what they can provide to a team” because I knew it would be something you would take out of context like you just have.   &gt;Look at guys like Joe Harris who couldn’t hit a shot when Brooklyn needed him to last year in the playoffs.He’s a vet, a proven player, and was playing next to better players than Kispert would be in New Orleans and it just didn’t happen for him. Guys who’ve been in the league for a while come up short in those spots. Hoping rookie year Kispert won’t is a hell of a bet.  Joe Harris shot 40% from 3 on 7 attempts a game in the 2021 playoffs.    &gt;Bro Lonzo and Bledsoe started over him because they’re vets. He’s 23 years old.  Lonzo ball is 10 months older than Nickeil Alexander-Walker.    &gt;He can round into being an efficient player. NAW is a safer bet than Kispert is in being an effective high level player in the league.  Based on what? There’s a track record in the NBA of shooters sticking more than rotational creators.  &gt;I keep mentioning them because Kispert will never play ahead of Zion and Ingram, you know the wings in New Orleans?  1. For the 4th time, position-less basketball. you can place multiple guys in multiple spots on the floor a different times.   2. Ingram, and Zion aren’t each playing 48 minutes a game.   &gt;Gordon again is just a template. Go get for Fournier, Alec Burks, type guys I don’t care.   You keep saying they can simply just get these guys yet keep brining up terrible examples, which is once again directly proving my point to how hard it is to get shooter and where their value stands in this league. Evan Fournier got paid 17million last season, Alex burks got paid 6 million last year and was on a. 11 million a year contract before that.   &gt;There guys who anyone who regularly watches the sport would count on as quality role players next year Ingram and Zion over Kispert  Well yes, I too would count 2 veteran starters as good role players to put next to Ingram and Zion. The problems are ;  1. They are going to get PAID up to 4x the amount of money kispert will, annually.   2. They are free agents and have no reason whatsoever to go to New Orleans unless they are getting over paid (ie JJ Reddick), when they can get paid their market value and have similar roles on better teams or in better cities.   Your entire argument in this thread against Kispert to New Orleans is illogical, contradictive and baseless. We’re going in circles and I’m responding to the same points over and over. I’m done here, have a good day 👍🏾"
&gt;  plus a starting backcourt of Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Kira Lewis.  Guess this means Lonzo’s definitely Gone!
Malik Monk is going to be the 3rd most important player on the Lakers roster this year.  Nickeil Alexander-Walker makes the all star game.
"Star: KAT. Feels like many have forgotten what this man is capable of when healthy.   Emerging star: RJ Barrett. I remember the hype surrounding this kid when he was drafted, he just finished this last year with 17.6 PPG. It’s clear he has higher levels he’s capable of hitting, question is how many? Low tier all-star? Superstar?  Unproven youngster: Nickeil Alexander-Walker. This last year he put up 11 ppg. He’s gonna have a bigger role, how much better his production gets with an increased role is something I’m interested in."
"He's 23 and just repeated his All Star season's numbers with Zion having the most efficient 27ppg season ever. Zion and BI are absolute stars and pillars. I didn't say runnint back the same team. The team made almost all of the changes they needed this year from last.   JV is in every way imaginable upgrade over Steven Adams. Eric Bledsoe shouldn't be in the NBA and is gone. Whoever replaces him starting NAW, Josh Hart or even Trey Murphy would be an instant upgrade. I liked Lonzo a lot, but there's no denying how good of a pick up Devonte Graham is. He was tied for 7 in the league with ast in just his 2nd year in and can shoot the 3. He's  shot 37.4 percent from 3 the last two seasons combined with 65% of his 13.8 fga coming from 3. Trey Murphy looks like the steak of the draft at 17th. He got all summer league avg 16.3/7/2.8 w 1.8stl 1.3blk on 56/44/100 splits and is 1 of 2 players to be 50/40/90 last season and playes great D.  This team is young. Sorry you want that to occur the same way super team rebuilds do. Naji is 23 and looked great us once he made it into rotation the last part of the season avg 9.7/5.8/3.4  his last 25 games. He has good size and can play d. Nickeil Alexander Walker and BI are 23, Zion is 21, Kira Lewis Jr is 21, Rookie Herbert  Jones who is 22 was All Sec first team, Sec DPOY,  and Sec POY and they got him at 35. They have tons of young developing talent and draft picks.  The Pels missed the play in by 2 games. They lost 17 games by 5 or less and 11 by 3 or less. Not having Bledsoe on the team alone last year would of made this team a playoff team. They hired Willie Green a former player for 12 years as a coach this summer. Greeen is highly praised around the league, won championships as an assistant with GSW from 2016-2019 and went to the WCF last year with Phoenix as an assistant and was highly praised by CP3.  So to act like the Pels are meandering, not making moves, are far off from competing, or are dropping the ball is really just not the case in anyway."

1. Nickeil Alexander Walker will win Most Improved Player.  2. Jrue will win DPOY.
"The Pelicans wanted Lowry for veteran leadership. How does Lonzo Ball help with that?  By the way, going from Ball to Nickeil Alexander-Walker is a massive upgrade for the Pels. And especially for Zion Williamson, who has a much higher on/off RTG with Alexander-Walker than with Ball."
"That same channel posted a Spencer Dinwiddie vs. Nickeil Alexander-Walker workout yesterday, and they have a ton more on their channel from previous off seasons."
"Nah, he's 38th   for reference  Isaac Okoro: 36th in 2019  Tyler Herro: 37th in 2018  Nickeil Alexander-Walker: 40th in 2017  -----------------  Basically if he develops physically a little bit, he's a fine NBA prospect. He's only about 6'2"" right now though."
"I love precious but no shot he wins over dudes like Nickeil Alexander Walker, Jordan Poole, Keldon Johnson, etc."
"Off topic, but why is Nickeil Alexander-Walker getting 24 shots while missing 18? 2/13 on 3s too."
"I’m down for the Pelicans spot  This off-season was definitely a doozy. While we made some good moves, you have to take into account that David Griffin was fixing some of the mistakes he made last season. We traded away Steven Adams and Eric “The Actual Devil” Bledsoe, thus freeing up a ton of cap space. While we couldn’t land a big free agent like Lowry or CP3, the Pelicans took their shot at it, and I can’t fault them for trying.  While the Pelicans caught, and are still catching, a lot of flak for letting Lonzo go, it was the right move. Paying Lonzo $21 million a year when we couldn’t even make the play-in last year with a mostly healthy team was not the move.   We added a few good pieces in Jonas Valanciunas and Devonte Graham, who will definitely make the Pelicans a better team.  The Pelicans this year are focusing on internal growth. Specifically Nickeil Alexander-Walker stepping up to be that 3rd scoring option, and Brandon Ingram making moves on defense. We’re also counting on rookie Trey Murphy III to lend us some spacing.  The biggest move of all was hiring new head coach Willie Green. The players love him and he seems like a huge upgrade over SVG.  All in all, the Pelicans are not worse than we were last year. If we’re better or if we made lateral moves remains to be seen. If Zion can come back healthy, and the guys we drafted take a step up, we will be fighting for a playoff spot."
Nickeil Alexander-Walker
"loooool     Dude goes back into broadcasting and immediately talks up Nickeil Alexander-Walker as an ""x"" factor for the Pelicans this year, when he sat him behind Eric Bledsoe's used cum rags as a head coach just a few months ago."
Nickeil Alexander-Walker
"High: Was a fan of these players before they got drafted and often wondered why they werent picked a bit higher.

Marcus Williams, Ben McLemore, Rodney Stuckey, Chris Douglas-Roberts, Earl Clark, Wesley Johnson, Kévin Séraphin, Andrew Nicholson, Nerlens Noel, Rashad Vaughn, Justin Patton, Wendell Carter Jr., Goga Bitadze.'Too soon, but I was high on Jalen Smith, Zeke Nnaji."

"Nickeil Alexander-Walker &gt; De'Andre Hunter  Jaxson Hayes &gt; De'Andre Hunter  So, yes.  In that deal Pels also got multiple second-round picks and major salary relief.  BTW, Nickeil Alexander-Walker &gt; Lonzo Ball"
Nickeil Alexander-Walker  Best 3 name player in this game no contest
"The Pelicans could run out two intriguing units:  SPEED: Kira Lewis/Devonte' Graham/Nickeil Alexander-Walker/Ingram/Zion  JUMBO: Ingram/Trey Murphy/Zion/Jaxson Hayes/Jonas Valanciunas  Each of those units are plausible 1–2–3–4–5, at least in short bursts. Neither would be used for long, if at all.  But they would be fun to see. The first could run circles around you, and the second could run you over."
"1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett 4. DeAndre Hunter  5. Darius Garland  6. Tyler Herro  7. PJ Washington  8. Rui Hachimura 9. Brandon Clarke  10. Matisse Thybulle 11. Keldon Johnson  12. Kevin Porter Jr   I'd take all of those guys ahead of him for sure, and then the debate for thw other two top-14 spots is between:  * Jordan Poole * Nickeil Alexander-Walker * Cam Johnson  * Cam Reddish * Darius Bazley * Nicolas Claxton * Terance Mann  * Lu Dort (whowent undrafted)  There's definitely a debate to be had, but I'd be leaning Cam Johnson and Lu Dort."
"Brown since Tatum's already bordering superstardom  Malik Monk  Tyrese Maxey  Brandon Clarke  Kevin Huerter  Miles Bridges  Bol Bol  Killian Hayes since he had an awful first year, and there's nowhere to go but up  Kevin Porter Jr., he turned a corner since arriving in Houston and is still super young compared to Wood  Tyler Herro since Duncan Robinson already looks polished and at his peak  RJ Barrett since Randle is already an All-NBA player  Terrance Mann since Winslow's injuries have hampered him too much  Nickeil Alexander-Walker  Patrick Williams  Anthony Edwards, a 20 year-old who came off of near ROY can really only get better."

Shoutout Nickeil Alexander-Walker. 22/5/1/1/1 in just the 4th. What a man
Who is this Nickeil Alexander-Walker and what did he do with the other Nickeil Alexander-Walker?
"Out of curiosity, I wanted to see exactly what return the Pels got in return, so I tried to follow the trades:  - **CP3**: Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, al-Farouq Aminu, 2012 Pick (Austin Rivers). Of these players, none re-signed with the Pels. Rivers was later traded along with Russ Smith for Quincy Pondexter (did not play for NOLA, due to injury) and a 2015 2nd (pick 56, Branden Dawson, traded to LAC for $$$). - **Anthony Davis**: Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, the 4th overall pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), a 2021 protected first-round pick (did not convert), the right to swap 2023 first-round picks, a 2024 first-round pick, and cash    - **Ball** was sign-and-traded for Garrett Temple, Tomas Satoransky, a 2024 2nd, and cash.   - NOLA would flip the 4th pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), for pick 8 (Jaxson Hayes), pick 17 (Nickeil Alexander-Walker) pick 35 (Didi Louzada) - as well as a protected 2020 pick, which did not appear to convert.  - Christian Wood was waived.  - **Jrue Holiday**: Return was Eric Bledsoe, 2025 &amp; 2027 first round picks, 2024 &amp; 2026 pick swap rights.  - Eric Bledsoe was later traded alongside Steven Adams, Ziaire Williams &amp; rights to Jared Butler in exchange for: Jonas Valančiūnas, and rights to Trey Murphy &amp; Brandon Boston.   - Brandon Boston would later be moved to the Clippers in exchange for Sacramento's 2022 second round pick (protected).   So in exchange for ""this crop"" the Pels got:    - Brandon Ingram - Garrett Temple - Tomas Satoransky - Jaxon Hayes - Nickeil Alexander-Walker - Didi Louzada - Jonas Valančiūnas - Trey Murphy  Draft picks picks picks:    - **From the AD trade**: LAL's 2024 first rounder, and right to swap 2023 first rounders. - **From the Jrue Holiday trade**: Milwaukee's 2025 &amp; 2027 firsts, right to swap 2024 &amp; 2026 firsts with Milwaukee, Sacramento's 2022 2nd round pick (protected). - **From the Lonzo Ball trade**: Chicago's 2024 2nd  Out of these, Ingram and Valančiūnas stand out, obviously - but Alexander-Walker is alright, and man that's a lot of firsts."
nickeil alexander walker. yes he has the talent that us fans praise so much about. but his iq and streakiness is infuriating. i love the kid but he's gotta be better with his decision making. and his streakiness is something you can only hope naturally gets fixed

"Kinda want Nickeil Alexander-Walker to become a star so we can all say ""Aw hell, NAW"" when he goes off against our teams"

Love this buddy but don’t sweat my cut! I owe penance for recommending Nickeil Alexander Walker as Most Improved - he’s been ice cold so far.
