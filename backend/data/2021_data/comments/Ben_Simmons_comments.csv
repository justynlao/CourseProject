"I think they were trying to say that Ben will shut him down and give him a night off, since his production would be down. Problem is that Simmons will actually make his night more difficult"
I really don‚Äôt understand where this comes from is Ben Simmons known for being bad at guarding Donovan?
"A. The sixers don't have enough accessible picks, b. Why would the bulls accept shitty and a guy that you are so thoroughly unimpressed by?  Yer stuck this idea that thybulle has to be exactly simmons or that the sixers have to have exactly simmons to be successful defensively.  That's bs, that's not a misunderstanding of how defense works, that's just you disagree with my take on all of thybulle, simmons, and a prospective sixers roster with beal instead of ben..."
Ben Simmons is a monster defensively.
Has Ben Simmons ever scored 54 points in a game? Fred &gt; Simmons
"Scoring is. Shooting just helps with that tremendously, but if you can just get yours then it don‚Äôt matter.   I wonder how someone like Ben Simmons would look on the Bucks instead of Giannis tho."
"&gt;2 Remaining Spots between Trae Young, Tobias Harris, Malcolm Brogden, Gordon Hayward, Jrue Holliday, Kyrie Irving, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic, Julius Randle, Zach LaVine &amp; Collin Sexton.  Brutal how do you even pick?"
"I stopped reading after you blamed Lowry for continuing to box out Simmons when Simmons jumped. Lowry was already leaning against Simmons, you expect him to just ease up and give Ben the rebound because he jumped?   Also I will bet you literally anything you want that the Raptors make the playoffs.  But speaking of fun, is it fun knowing that the vaunted Boston Celtics have as many title wins as the Raptors in the past 30 years?"
Comes down to being able to sign a contract where he thought he could break through vs getting stuck on a random team I think. He also gets the benefit of breaking from team control early and signed a contract after his second year. Which is why he was able to sign for 9 mil a season after his second year. He was paid more than Ben Simmons the last two seasons and they were in the same draft.
"Donovan has improved every single year he‚Äôs been in the league, Ben Simmons criticism is somewhat warranted considering he hasn‚Äôt improved much since entering the league. Shaq‚Äôs hate for Rudy is on another level as well, he posted a damn instagram picture of him dunking on Rudy."
Ben Simmons
Rockets fans always playing the victim. Ben Simmons Luka Doncic classified as PGs why would Harden get laughed at when playing next to Eric Gordon?
Jokic and Embiid probably could. Ben Simmons might be able to as well. Maybe Giannis.
Lmao I feel bad for Russ and Ben Simmons. I‚Äôm any random thread they liable to get blasted for no reason.
That's just straight up not true.      I made a comment about Tobias Harris' competition but Ben Simmons is also no chance. There are 8 guards in the East (only a maximum of 6 can make the team) that are having a better season than Simmons.      |Player|Pos|Conf|Tm|G|PTS‚ñº|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|3P|FG%|3P%|FT%| :--|:--|:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:| |Jaylen Brown|G|E|BOS|18|27.1|5.4|3.5|1.4|0.6|2.6|0.531|0.443|0.756| |James Harden|G|E|BRK|16|24.5|6.4|11.1|1.0|0.7|3.1|0.463|0.371|0.880| |Trae Young|G|E|ATL|19|26.9|4.2|9.0|0.7|0.2|2.3|0.422|0.364|0.887| |Kyrie Irving|G|E|BRK|14|27.6|4.8|6.0|1.0|0.7|2.9|0.525|0.421|0.945| |Zach LaVine|G|E|CHI|19|26.6|5.3|5.1|1.3|0.6|3.5|0.510|0.419|0.881| |Bradley Beal|G|E|WAS|15|34.9|5.1|4.7|1.3|0.6|2.4|0.479|0.340|0.891| |Collin Sexton|G|E|CLE|16|24.1|2.6|4.1|1.0|0.2|1.7|0.498|0.435|0.824| |Malcolm Brogdon|G|E|IND|20|22.9|4.3|7.0|1.4|0.3|3.0|0.457|0.404|0.896|.
I want to see Ben Simmons against Draymond in a three point contest.
"Agreed, he's about average for his position and it's not like defence is that important for a guard anyway unless you're ben simmons and secretly a power forward."
Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons.
"Ben Simmons is 24 years old, 6'11, can guard all 5 positions, is one of the game's best playmakers and is under contract until 2025.  Dame is absolutely a better player right now, but Simmons is extremely high value as a trade asset. And, the Blazers obviously aren't title contenders anyways right now."
"the ‚Äúben simmons having his own team‚Äù narrative really only makes sense if he‚Äôs playing with a stretch 5, which Nurkic is definitely not"
Go lookup our 2015-2016 roster and tell me Ben Simmons is dragging that team to the playoffs
Daryl morey would strap ben simmons to his back in a baby harness and walk him across the country barefoot if thats what it took to make this deal happen straight up. I promise you he wouldnt ask for picks
Casual fan here. Who is Jason Tatum?  I know Luka and LeBron and Embiid and Steph and Harden and Ben Simmons and Kyrie but I never heard of Jason Tatum ü§î
Ben Simmons
so keen to see Olympic Patty and Delly with Ben Simmons!
Yes Ben Simmons is not capable of leading a team to a championship while being the pg of the offense that is what I mean. Ben is leagues ahead of lonzo cause of his size and he has better handles and better vision. But nonetheless the point still stands he cannot be the lead ball handler on a championship team cause he has the same issue as lonzo in the halfcourt just not to the degree lonzo has it. I never said Ben isn‚Äôt a good passer you put words in my mouth.
Now you‚Äôre trying to tell me Ben Simmons isn‚Äôt a good passer and can‚Äôt consistently set up players to score........ yea just agree to disagree on this convo.
You can‚Äôt consistently set players up to score with a poor handle in the nba. So agree to disagree. If that were the case then svg would‚Äôve started lonzo at pg. But he didn‚Äôt cause he already knows this. This is the same issue with Ben Simmons. It doesn‚Äôt matter how good your vision is if you can‚Äôt dribble your passing is completely nerfed in the half court. And the half court is where most of the game takes place.
"Well considering the Rockets have been playing great basketball, have a boatload of unprotected 1sts coming their way from a team that could be horrible in 3 years, and Ben Simmons not being a piece the Rockets FO valued that highly, I'd say they made out fairly well."
I think his percentage has a lot to do with shot selection. If he gets the ben simmons treatment I bet he would shoot close to 40% in those situations.
"I'm not saying they are the same player defensively.  I'm saying thybulle makes it so if you trade ben for beal, you still can be an excellent defensive team, as thybulle on the perimeter is an excellent, growing, defensive piece.  I dunno where TF sixers fans are getting so triggered or reading that I'm saying they're are the same exact player and absolutely nothing would change.  But beal + thybulle absolutely has a chance to be better a better offense/defense pairing than simmons + thybulle, and it's not like flipping simmons would tank the defense when you have guys like thybulle left over."
"&gt; Why isn't that knee limiting his defensive performance this season?  well it was earlier, he wasn't nearly as good at moving laterally as he was last season....he's getting better though               &gt; comparing a #1 overall pick in Ben Simmons with Draymond Green is why he gets criticized so much                That doesn't make sense. That's like saying that you're comparing #1 pick Simmons with #15 pick Giannis. Doesn't matter where you were picked, it matters how good you eventually became. Draymond was arguably a top ten player at his peak so that's not exactly a low bar. Simmons went #1 with the expectation that he would eventually develop a jump shot which would make him a generational player. Sometimes expectations don't play out...but hey, he's got a few years left so who knows."
I like how both mentions of Ben Simmons have him as a forward. He was still at high school then right? Must have been pretty hyped.
"PG - Luka, Trae, Suggs, Ja, Brogdon  SG - Beal, Lavine, Mitchell, Shai, DeAndre Hunter  SF - Tatum, Brown, Ingram, Emoni Bates, Mikal Bridges  PF - AD, Giannis, Ben Simmons, Zion, Sabonis  C - Jokic, Bam, Wiseman, Embiid, Gobert"
"You know the finals went 6 games right?  That's not a gentleman sweep.  Tells me all I need to know about you.  Not to mention Dragic was out, Bam missed games then played hurt, and Butler was banged up early in the series.  Still took it to 6.  Celtics worse than last year.  Nets can't guard shit.  Bucks, we always take care of them.  76ers still have Ben Simmons fucking up their spacing."
Damn.  Even Ben Simmons has one.
Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons
"The premise of ‚Äúchampionship winning coach‚Äù is a tough qualifications because by that standard, Brad Steven‚Äôs can‚Äôt be considered one while guys like Vogel on his third team and Kerr can based on the talent around them. I think u mean more that Brett can‚Äôt take a top 5-7 team to a top 1-3 team, in which case, I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt think you can give a proper, fair evaluation of him overall until he‚Äôs coaching another team and we see how that compares. The idea of Ben Simmons in the playoffs also can‚Äôt be ignored."
It actually means he can shoot better than Ben Simmons fun fact Westbrook is shooting better from 3 than Luka and many others.
what half a season with ben simmons does to a guy
I really hate these trap posts where the title of the post is a normal question but than the post is just used to shit on a player. Seems to happen alot to the ben simmons trade posts.
"Who in the world can break a 2-3 zone with Dwight Howard, Ben Simmons, and Matisse Thybulle. You‚Äôve gotta beat them from the corner."
"College success doesn‚Äôt matter that much in the draft. If anything, people are often drafted higher than they should be because they were on a winning team   LSU didn‚Äôt do amazing with Ben Simmons but he was drafted based on his skill and potential"
Embiid deserves this more.  He has to play with Ben Simmons.
That would make your team better in the playoffs. It‚Äôs actually hard to understate how much more viable they‚Äôd be against good competition with Kyle Lowry. The Sixers are going nowhere with Ben Simmons as the main ball handler. He can‚Äôt do shit in the half court. Sixers fans continue to delude themselves.
"Absolutely this. The way this team is playing right now, I  don't think Beal gives the Sixers any better chance of winning than Simmons not to mention so many of the parts are new so they really are a little over 20 games playing together. This team going through the season together and getting better at playing together has a better chance in my opinion of doing more damage than if they swapped Ben for Beal in the middle of the season."
"Sixers:  Pleasant: Tobias Harris. Truly rewired his basketball brain this year and has almost entirely gotten rid of all his frustrating tendencies from last year. He‚Äôs a big positive on the floor, insanely consistent, and is a quick decision maker, shooter, and ball mover. Truly didn‚Äôt think it was possible but gleefully eating my words.  Unpleasant: Not much. Maybe Ben‚Äôs offense early the season, but he was clearly still recovering from injury (and was missing a disproportionate amount of layups) and has looked improved over a recent stretch. Dwight‚Äôs a great add to the team but I think people over-exaggerated how good he‚Äôd be, he‚Äôs a really bad fit with Simmons and we still need to acquire a stretch 4/5. The trio of Ben/Dwight/Matisse are just putrid, you can‚Äôt have two effective non-shooters on the floor with Simmons, but that‚Äôs fine, it‚Äôs still early, moves will be made. Pretty great start so far!  I‚Äôm a little less bullish on the Sixers playoffs prospects than some, but it‚Äôs beautiful to have a team that‚Äôs fun to watch and is moving in a positive direction again after the last few years of mismanagement."
A proven champion who is an elite playmaker and great defender and a great shooter. And unlike ben simmons he can do pick and roll.
"I see him as Ben Simmons type. He's great as what he does, probably will be never be a good defender or shooter."
Yeah. I hear about Ben Simmons &amp; Carson Wentz every single day. If I couldn‚Äôt handle trash talk I wouldn‚Äôt still be here
"All the other players listed at the top of those have been routinely considered as good to great defenders. AD, lebron, Embiid, Gobert, Giannis, Simmons, Turner... all are on the DWS leaderboard, and DBPM adds Gasol, iggy, bam, Dray to that list.   Meanwhile RAPM (or maybe it was just RPM) listes Ben Simmons as a bottom 10 defender as of a few games ago.   I'm not saying these stats are the best or uber reliable, but they seem to line up with everyone's eye test, and awards voting, and what GMs and coaches think. Obviously there may be some confirmation bias there, but it's still noteworthy."
"Its better to build around Ben simmons than Jayson Tatum,"
Doesn't one of those metrics have Ben Simmons as a bottom 10 defender? That pretty much says all I need to know
"You can have 6 guards, but he's also not making it over Ben Simmons.  #1 seed and defense have to mean something.  EDIT: or Malcolm Brogdon"
"There‚Äôs more talent in the league than ever . A lot of it is hype but I think it‚Äôs fair to put the generational tag on players who are a couple of tiers above the rest   For example , I think Lamelo is the best player in the draft by a pretty good length . But last year , was mostly hype since you couldn‚Äôt say the same for Zion and the rest of his class . Ben Simmons was different since he was red shirted for a year  , and he is still a jump shot away from being Lebron James and was very obviously a cut above the 2017 rookie class, even Donovan Mitchell"
"Well I do. And I‚Äôm being tame with my generational , I would say Lamelo is a transcendent TALENT. I think he will win MVPs and all the awards (can‚Äôt speak for chips as of yet , that‚Äôs a team/FO thing). Ben Simmons is a generational talent are you out of your mind? Dude is a multiple time all star with no jumpshotü§£ü§£  I think all the players you mentioned are generational TALENTS that can turn out to be generational PLAYERS . It‚Äôs my opinion that Lamelo happens to be a Unicorn . If his name was Jackson instead of Ball he‚Äôd get much more respect imo"
"Thybulle is really good, but Simmons is a little more versitile. Ben can guard 1-4 (and some 5s), whereas Mattisse can struggle vs bigger forwards sometimes. Simmons is also probably more sound fundamentally. Thybulle has gotten better at this, but he still reaches at times when he doesn't need to and fouls more than you'd like."
"Im going to go the other way and say that Box Scores are underappreciated. Obviously if i was deciding a contract/trade i would want to fully evaluate that player and that it is more valuable to do so by watching games and understanding the context, but on the flip side, there are a lot of players that may fly under the radar that dont dont get the benefit of being a big name.       A single game/handful of games arent going to be very helpful, but over 30/40 games the box scores will reach a point where you can sort of pick from clusters to compare. Its a much safer bet to guess two players with 18/5/4 are close to the same tier. Or, at least closer than say a player averaging 6/2/2.  I dont think box scores are the problem inherently, but the fact that people use the thresholds so firmly in their analysis and over such short samples. Like a player averaging 25 vs averaging 28 is pretty negligible, but some people will act as if 28 is leagues above.  Given differences in team structure/coaching/etc. i think the best way to compare players is to set tiers and ask ""if these two flipped teams, would either player/team benefit?"" Random hypothetical example (with first two names i thought of, not that they are necessarily same skill), if you swap Westbrook and Ben Simmons how does each team look? How do Embiid/Tobias/Beal all get impacted? None of their skills changed, but they may now be in more/less favorable roles. Maybe tobias gets 2 fewer shots so his PPG drops 1. Maybe Westbrooks ASTs jump as he has more playmakers around him. Is Russ now better because his teammates hit more of the shots he set them up for?       I think box score is a good tool for evaluating , but that the data is a bit fuzzy and you have to account for that and treat the data as larger clusters rather than absolute numbers."
"Nets are determined to have every game score look like a damn All-star game.  How the hell are they gonna win a series with THIS level of terrible offense?   Sure they can score like crazy but if they give up this much points to even a decent playoff team, their role players will get going and you will have results like this ( No I am not talking about the Wizards ). Not to mention their star players dominating.   Hell, Embiid might average 50 points against the Nets if they match up. And Ben Simmons might even score 30+ !"
"The Rockets went have been a second round exit for most of Harden's time in Houston. Their peak was WCF against an amazing Warriors team as many have pointed out here. Keeping Harden wouldn't help them go anywhere, so I don't really see where is the loss. They could have done better with Ben Simmons imo. Longer term player that plays stellar defense and is great at finishing at the rim. You have a lot of space for him to play in your team and you can wait with him since he is still not in his prime and can be build around easily.  Cavs traded a Bucks 1st for Allen. That is pretty good, not many late 1st get you a top notch starter."
"Ingram is a good defender. Not as good as Simmons, but the gap isn't that big to be an issue. The Sixers will still be a top tier defense with all the big bodies they have, including the MVP frontrunner  Transition passing is highly overrated; anyone can make the right plays in transition, those are gimmes. Simmons halfcourt playmaking is just decent, not great, similar to Lonzo. He's highly overrated as a playmaker due to this  Ingram is a great passer &amp; playmaker in his own right, and is almost as good as Ben to the point where it wouldn't make a difference if they swapped places  Add Ingram's shooting... and the Sixers are legitimately better and the Pels are worse. Lonzo, Simmons, Bledsoe, Zion and Adams all getting play time together, I wanna vomit at that spacing"
""" With Simmons without Embiid - -13.23 net rating"" that stood out more to me.  However, I think we should take everything with a grain of salt so far, especially this year when the schedule of strength and matchup is something we need to look heavily into.  Also there's just not enough data to make an conclusion based on these numbers.  &amp;#x200B;  We can expand adding Tobias Harris into the mix: and the data changes which you probably can't conclude anything except for the 76ers are damn good this year.

Ben Simmons
"Shit argument. If that's the case, Brogdon &gt; Ben considering he's made it farther than Simmons in the playoffs  Anyways, swap positions with Simmons on this terribly designed NOLA team and Ingram on that spaced out, talented Philly team with the MVP frontrunner and the Sixers are even better (because they now have a star who can fucking shoot a basketball) while the Pellies become a lottery team."

"People point to plays like this as a reason why Sixers fans shouldn't be frustrated with Ben Simmons. I point to it as a prime example of why I get frustrated with Ben Simmons. Like, we all know he can do this shit when he wants to and so often during games he just takes his foot off the pedal.  Prime example he scored 6 points quickly and easily in the first 2 minutes against the Lakers and then I dunno if he scored a FG again until late in the 2nd quarter. I get that teams adjust and he impacts the game in other ways, and I don't think he's a bad player by any stretch, I just want him to play at his full potential like is on display in this clip.   &amp;#x200B;  TL; DR: Hold."
You say Jaylen brown &gt; ben simmons as if that alone puts simmons outside the top 5? When brown is top 2? I'm not following the logic
No Ben Simmons wouldn‚Äôt get picked top 5 in redraft  Jaylen Brown &gt; Ben Simmons  Can‚Äôt wait until he doesn‚Äôt make all star team and he can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm ‚Äúall star‚Äù for his reason for not shooting
And the Sixers are better defensively when Ben Simmons is off the floor for the second year in a row.  Tells you how important rotations are for these stats
&gt; Ben Simmons in the playoffs is unreliable.  Yea i would hate to have the undisputed best guard/wing-defender on my team.
Ben Simmons and Embiid can work yes but you're really going to tell me something like Lillard and Embiid isn't a better pairing?
Ben Simmons has not improved on offense since coming into the league. Your half court offense still has the same old issues.
My point is more about harping on one aspect of a players deficiency.. like Ben Simmons literally has a phobia about shooting the ball (talk about a fundamental aspect) but he contributes to winning.  Obi is having a rough start but we have to wait and see what he‚Äôll be.. also his defensive actually hasn‚Äôt been that bad.
"But can they win in the playoffs? Embiid is great, but Ben Simmons in the playoffs is unreliable."
He should just @ everybody on this sub who comments on Ben Simmons
"I‚Äôm amazed how many of you guys (Sixer fans) are downplaying how well the team is constructed this season. The signs are there, this team is legit: - PF-sized ball-handler and a legit unicorn surrounded by three 3&amp;D-ish guys, - they have both an elite defender at the point of attack (Ben) and at the rim (Joel), - their best two players are also their two biggest players (important when teams try smallball lineups), - they can contain players that play bullyball from the perimeter with Ben and bullyball in the post with Joel,  - They‚Äôre still getting reps in for that high-post p&amp;r between Embiid and Simmons, but boy oh boy will that be dangerous in the playoffs."
Exactly so Ben Simmons record against him in the regular season is irrelevant.
Ben ‚ÄúRandy Moss‚Äù Simmons
Ben Simmons is 13-0 vs Kemba in the NBA.
Kork's offense was more impactful than Ben's D in the 4th. The Sixers were doing fine w/o Ben in that quarter.  I don't know what game you watched but the Sixers mostly played zone in the 4th and Thybulle was the one who contested those 4 missed fgs. Thybulle was on Brogdon more than Ben in that quarter.  I agree without Simmons this is a loss.
Lmao you really check every Ben Simmons post to slander him what did he do to you
"I was a huge Jerami fan in college and was thrilled he fell to us. Upset big collar dumped him.   Random but want to give a shoutout to David Thorpe who was super high on jerami in the draft and saw him as Kawhi light which seemed ridiculous at the time, but it's kind of not that bad right now. He also said after Ben Simmons was drafted that he had defensive player of the year potential when everyone was saying that he was trash on defense. Dude clearly has a good eye for talent."
"This guy is obsessed with hating on Ben Simmons. It's really sad actually, just look at his post history, it's [littered](https://i.imgur.com/gnAnN8S.jpg) with comments about Ben. Dude needs help."
"He‚Äôll never be Giannis 2.0, but he will be Ben Simmons 1.0. Man is a great talent that just needs consistency."
They should trade harden for Ben Simmons /s
i loved going to the new posts on here and always seeing a post either shitting on Ben Simmons or shitting on Russ.  some people really got nothing better to do than hate
Ben Simmons is def up there for DPOY this season for sure.
Ben Simmons guards almost anyone. At anytime. The Peacemaker. Or whatever his nickname was.
Ben Simmons. This sub goes crazy because he‚Äôs not willing to go 2/10 on 3s then flop for 20 freethrows
Ben f\*cking Simmons
Ben Fuking Simmons
Ben Simmons happened
"82-95 to start the 4th.  When Simmons checks in its 98-106  So in the first 6 minutes of the half they score 11 points, but we score 16...so it cuts the lead by 5 points.  Then once ben checks in they pretty much dont score again the rest of the game.  If you don't see the connection i dunno what to tell ya.   Simmons played 35 minutes, 2.5 min above his average. So how do you know he wasn't going to bring him back anyway. Seems like he game planned it well."
"Now imagine getting the rebound off a brick 3 and running the fast break, only to get the ball poked out from behind from **Ben Simmons**"
You guys been watching my man Ben Simmons in the paint getting buckets anytime he wants this season?
"I guess Pacers never scouted Ben Simmons, why would you ever double him anywhere outside the 3pt line?  I guess they were afraid of him sinking a half-court jumper"
They have Ben Simmons too I guess
The only thing to stop a bad guy with a Ben Simmons is a good guy with a Ben Simmons.
"Ben Simmons does a decent job on Harden. He put the clamps on Harden in the fourth in the last game we played against the Nets. (Don't hold me to historical data, Harden's put up some games on us)."
i still think harden harder to stop tho. give harden tobias harris and seth curry with ben simmons playing small ball 5? how do you stop that
"Sixers lead series 3-1.  Game 5 Sixers won series 4-1.   Final score: Sixers 138- 110 Nets  Joel Embiid: 40pts, 15 reb, 3 ast, 4 blk Ben Simmons: 21pts, 14reb, 12ast, 5 stl Tobias Harris: 27pts, 12 reb, 3 ast Kyle Lowry: 21pts, 4reb, 14ast"
Ben Simmons wet dream
I don‚Äôt know about that. They have no one to stop Embiid and he‚Äôs for sure going to cause the Nets to get in foul trouble. Ben Simmons is playing like the DPOY and in theory should be able to bother KD. I really think they can go 6 or 7 with a slight chance of an upset
"Yes, they‚Äôre gonna keep getting bounced out the playoffs otherwise. Morey would‚Äôve trade Simmons too if Houston let him. ‚ÄúHurt their chances for next several‚Äù. Lol. We bounced them and they had Butler. Simmons/Embiid will get bounced again and again. They don‚Äôt have a floor general. Can‚Äôt win playoffs games when Ben Simmons is standing top of the key with no defenders and still scared of shooting a 3. So the ‚Äúbut will Sixers take Lowry for Maxey please‚Äù  shit needs to stop. We don‚Äôt need Maxey, we have plenty of young and older guards that need on court time. They need Lowry or they‚Äôre gonna enjoy getting bounced every playoffs."
"I didn‚Äôt even say the trade was bad. I said it‚Äôs risky trade, which objectively it is. There is risk and then there is risk. Trading away Jaylyn Brown for AD is risky. Trading Ben Simmons for Harden has some risk. Trading basically all your draft picks 7 years down the road is a different type of risk."
"Embiid during the final Raptor's possession in the 2019 ECF. I'd hang back and let Simmons cover Kawhi all the way to the corner instead of forcing the switch and letting Kawhi get an extra half-step.  Not that I think Embiid fucked up, I just think Ben staying on Kawhi would've done a better job of disrupting that shot."
there is something extremely intangible about being in a real game versus practice that makes  shots 10x harder. fuck ben simmons can shoot 60/100 feom 3 in the gym
"Plus 25 points great defense Paul George, almost a starter jaylen brown, DPOY gobert, and versatile big man sabonis. It also helps that team Durant lost embiid, booker, and Durant which was replaced by Conley, while team lebron lost just Ben Simmons"
Ben Simmons keeping hope alive üí™
"I would take Steph, but it‚Äôs close, and anyone taking Magic is certainly justifiable. The reasoning is that Steph‚Äôs all world skill is something you can build a one man offense around, regardless of your other players.   Magic‚Äôs vision and passing is leagues above anyone else‚Äôs, and even though he inherently makes his teammates better with those skills, you still need good teammates around him to maximize that.   Obviously he‚Äôs WAAAAY better than Ben Simmons, I‚Äôm not comparing their skill levels when I say this, but their play styles are sort of similar. Athletic as fuck, great vision and passing, beats in transition, but in the half court no one is afraid of their jumpers. You have to build a very specific team around Magic to maximize him, and if you do that correctly it‚Äôll be one of the best teams of all-time, but if you don‚Äôt, he won‚Äôt shine as much as his skill would suggest. He‚Äôs also a positive role model and leader for your team.  Steph on the other hand, doesn‚Äôt have those ‚Äúlimitations‚Äù when building a team. I plug him in at PG and no matter the personnel I put around him, he‚Äôll enhance the team‚Äôs success with his shooting and his shooting gravity. You could build a team like the Warriors did, or you could build a team with Steph and 4 stalwart defenders and have Steph run the offense.   A hypothetical team of Steph, Jrue, Artest, AK47, and Ben Wallace would be impossible to score against, and Steph could give you 30+ a night on immaculate efficiency, and you‚Äôd run away with the title having the 8th-10th best offense and the 1st defense by a wide margin.  That same team with Magic would still be amazing, but it would certainly have limitations on offense. Steph can be the engine for any offense in history regardless of the other guys and make it work. Magic could also make any team work to an extent, but if you don‚Äôt have great cutters/off ball movers, you won‚Äôt get 100% of what Magic is capable of, albeit by no fault of his own."
"Game didnt feel right without  Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid. Something about this allstar game, just felt... empty."
The only players who played LESS than Lebron on his team were Sabonis and Ben Simmons....   His team was soooo much better than he didn't even try...lol
"Team Lebron was so fucking good, he barely played. Literally the two players on his team that didn't play more than him were Ben Simmons and Sabonis."
"He drafted 4 other playmakers (Steph, Jokic, Luka, Giannis) as starters then CP3, Ben Simmons and Dame on the bench. It was basically an entire team without him."
He knew Ben Simmons was watching
If you can beat a team consisting of Ben Simmons/JJ Reddick/Jimmy Butler/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid and then beat the MIL Bucks AND the GSW that‚Äôs a solid ass run
"It's just sad nobody good does it anymore.  Imagine if it were guys like Zion, Giannis, Donovan Mitchell, and Ben Simmons out there"
Where is Ben Simmons
"needed ben simmons in this game, he really sets the pace"
"Asked if he supports Black Lives Matter Gordon Hayward says - ""That's a conversation that my family and I will have. ...Keep that to a private thing.""  Asked if he will will shoot a 3 tonight Ben Simmons says - ""That's a conversation that my family and I will have. ...Keep that to a private thing.""  Asked if he believes the Earth is round Kyrie Irving says - ""That's a conversation that my hermetic brothers and I will have. ...Keep that to a private thing."""
Covid protocol along with Ben Simmons.
They don‚Äôt have Ben Simmons to hold it down
Ya should‚Äôve subbed in Ben Simmons
Next year we should do an anti 3pt contest gimme Ben Simmons Giannis Rudy gobert Andre Drummond and Dwight Howard
Or Ben Simmons lol
"Luka's block numbers are interesting. He averages more per game than Jokic, Vucevic, Steven Adams, Ben Simmons, Sabonis, and, just to be a jerk, Bagley."
I can't believe Adam Silver forced Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons to go get a haircut    üò°
Ben Simmons could do it
"Sixers, Bucks, Nets, Celtics, Heat, and Raptors have players who are talented, and will out execute Knicks players in playoffs with grindfest game Thibs going to coach his players. I know Thibs will be prepare, and will come up with game plan for his players to put them in position to succeed. Nets with KD, Harden, and Kyrie can have easy time with multiple actions they can run. Maybe Sixers if Joel Embiid be better playmaker in post, and Ben Simmons be scoring threat."
"tatum, i do kind of like brown tho     morant is a pretty good pick     people trash on ben simmons so much he might be underrated at this point lol"
"I mean, Ben Simmons is *Technically* a point guard, but really he's like a pf. I think a true guard would need like 3 steals a game."
"Also, ben simmons is a legit DPOTY candidate...most pundits have him in the top 2."
Ben Simmons can raise the floor of a team imo.
"Totally agree. Even if the eye test says Ben Simmons is the best defender in history, and 76er diehards create a Ben Simmons shrine in their mother‚Äôs basement, just watching a game won‚Äôt make up for his lack of defensive metrics. Also, compare him to the other front runners for DPOY, and the fact that the award trends towards rim protectors because they are defensively much more valuable than perimeter defenders, and there‚Äôs no chance he wins."
"You can definitely make an argument for Embiid being better or more impactful, but if the DPOY award goes to a Sixer it will 100% be Simmons  Awards are all narrative based, not that Ben isn't easily a top 5 defender in the league"
"At the risk of getting downvoted again for saying it, if the DPOY is a sixer it's not Ben Simmons..."
Ben Simmons defense is so overrated. KD is going to torch this bum in the playoffs
"he‚Äôs bad on the perimeter too. can‚Äôt guard any of the top guards like AD can. and shit, i think Ben Simmons could probably play better post D than Gobert on some matchups. Gobert is legit overrated now."
"If I'd used Harden vs Russ you'd complain that it wasn't a valid criticism because Russ is utter garbage, and you'd be right. The reason I used Harris is because he is a phenomenal shooter who is allowed to overacheive because he has players around him that enable his strengths. Just like Simmons has in Embiid. The point was that saying you should give an award to someone because they're better in their role instead of giving it to the best is fucking idiotic.  Ben Simmons is an All-Defense 1st team, guaranteed. He is one of the best defensive guards in recent years, but he provides less defensive value to your  team than Embiid does, and Embiid provides less than Gobert does. If Simmons is not the most important part of the defense on his own team, why the actual fuck would you expect him to be DPOY?"
 The bolded ones are all Yes.   The strikethroughs definitely No.  The others are borderline.   &amp;#x200B;  * **Lebron James** * James Harden * Steph Curry * **Giannis Antetokoumpo** * **Kevin Durant** * ~~Kyrie Irving~~ * Kawhi Leonard * Nikola Jokic * ~~Russell Westbrook~~ * ~~Luka Doncic~~ * Joel Embiid * ~~Karl-Anthony Townes~~ * ~~Jayson Tatum~~ * ~~Ben Simmons~~ * ~~Devin Booker~~ * ~~Trae Young~~
"Dr J for the sixers is obvious, but his peak dunking was aba pre sixers. I think Andre iguodala is pretty underrated in game dunker. Article mentioned darryl dawkins and throw in Ben Simmons for pretty solid list for one team."
The Ben Simmons special
&gt;He can score and even creates with his gravity  Guarantee if I say this about Ben Simmons everyone would disagree.  Why is that?  Advanced stats are a good indicator but it takes out a lot of context imo.
In the moment the out of bounds call felt awful. It was in hindsight the right call considering it touched the official per the rules. The communication at least to the tv audience was awful which led to even announcers from both teams confusion. The Donovan Mitchell jump into the defender 3 should have been an offensive foul on the Jazz. The Ben Simmons grabbing Mitchell that was called an offensive was one of the worst calls I've seen in a while. The refs were bad both ways period. And it's a core issue in the league. A refs job is hard. They will never get it all correct but for a number one seed head to head matchup we deserved better as fans and the athletes deserved better as well.
"&gt; If ben simmons or whatever other defensive expert on the perimeter got lit up by harden or curry or doncic lillard whatever nobody would tear down on him as much as they do with gobert.  Because you brought him up.  &gt; And the fact you haven't openly mentioned it doesn't mean that your comment doesn't suggest it.  Translation: ""I make up imagined arguments because my points are fucking idiotic."""
"Ben Simmons didn‚Äôt play a single game that series, guess that doesn‚Äôt matter at all lmao"
I don't even know why we are talking about ben simmons dude. And the fact you haven't openly mentioned it doesn't mean that your comment doesn't suggest it. Leave it at that.
"A generational talent is a player that does everything at a High level. Offense (not only scoring), defense, playmaking, rebounding etc. And who takes over his generation. Few players can do that (Lebron, Kobe, MJ, Magic, Bird) Players on this generation who can be considered a generational talent can be Giannis, LeBron and Ben Simmons or maybe Kawhi.  I know some of y'all can think that putting ben or giannis is absurd but its true."
Never mentioned overpaid. Never mentioned Ben Simmons as an elite offensive player. Stop arguing with strawmen.
Overpaid player = bad player. Terrible reasoning.  Stop acting like ben simmons is an elite offensive player bc he is a beast in transition. He looks like a PF from the 80s in the halfcourt. Most of the value he brings to a team is on the defensive end.
"As a Jazz fan I'm sure you understand Rudy's impact WAY better than I do. But from the perspective of a coupe scenarios like this and the series with GSW (maybe this was regular season) stand out as hunting for guard on Gobert matchups.  The criteria for the award has certainly changed, not saying Rudy is undeserving in the slightest just that I wish some wing defenders would get looks. Marcus Smart, Ben Simmons, those guys."
Obviously it doesn‚Äôt count because harden is not carrying scrubs like Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris. Murray and AD are nobodys too so they aren‚Äôt import either.
Ben Simmons isn't paid 205 million dollars to be a purely defensive player. Terrible analogy.
"Simmons is one of the rare players who can lock all 5 positions. If you watched most of the Sixers game, you can realize that Ben is always guarding the best player and efficiently. Just look last game vs Mitchel, vs Lillard, Doncic."
"Damn, In his 3rd year Ben simmons have 31 of those 168 sixers tripple doubles"
Ben Simmons
"After Beal dropped 60 on the Sixers when Ben Simmons and another guy was double teaming him, Simmons dropped out of the DPOY conversation."
"Love the podcast name.  A couple of seasons ago, you jokingly said Ben Simmons was hiding the 3 point shooting for the playoffs.  If any player could unveil a new skill in the playoffs, what would be your favorite?"
Would Ben Simmons have the confidence to shoot 3s if he stayed with Tinashe?
"Hill would be great but I assume he will have other suitors as well. Ben is the only PG in the rotation and he's really a point forward. We're starving here.  PGs the Sixers have had in the Embiid/Simmons era: TJ, Fultz, Point Jimmy, Raul Neto, this season literally no one"
Hurr durr Ben Simmons is not a pg?
"The Jazz are angry because Gobert first fouls Ben Simmons with no call, but when he fouls Embiid, that's when the foul is called. They're clearly upset that Ben Simmons didn't get the first foul call. /s"
"Ben Simmons isn‚Äôt really impressive to me due to the fact he doesn‚Äôt shoot the ball. Kyrie, Zach, and Devin however are the most impressive because they shoot at extremely high volumes and shoot tons and tons of jumpers."
Ben Simmons and Giannis is one of the worst star pairings I can imagine at least on offense. Defense would be nutty
"Ben Simmons is the DPOY, this proves it."
bubble TJ Warren gave ben the business last season! lol i‚Äôm just memein. simmons should 100% be DPOY.

"That's the key. Look at Ben Simmons, he hardly gets calls because contact doesn't effect him in the slightest. If he at least played it up slightly he'd go to the line 6 more tines a game."
"3 time all star, all-nba. Ben Simmons owns the Utah Jazz. Gobert has now had 2 seperate sixers drop 40 on his head in 2 games."
"Ben Simmons does suck, you‚Äôre right. Had to get bailed out by Joel on Mitchell all night. Hope he develops a shot so he can make it in some team‚Äôs rotation someday."
https://www.nba.com/news/defensive-player-ladder-ben-simmons-steals-no-1-spot lmao
"This isn‚Äôt a really good take tho. Playing defense, especially as a center, is about a lot more than shutting down the opposing center. This league is full of movement, switches, and rotations, all of which Gobert is phenomenal at.   Centers are tasked with pick and roll defense and often times have to play defense against many positions. Gobert shines at this.   Tonight I‚Äôve seen several posts where people only look at a 1 on 1 matchup as if that is all that matters. It doesn‚Äôt. And even if it did. There isn‚Äôt many players in the league that can shut down an offensive superstar. It just doesn‚Äôt happen. The barometer shouldn‚Äôt be that and those voting for defensive player of the year probably know that.   Another example - Ben Simmons the other DPOY candidate let Mitchell put up 33."
"thing is its hard to compare those two  with Gobert.  Embiid last night took 27 shots, Gobert 10, of course one is scoring 40. They are the primary offensive weapon of their teams while Gobert is like third option on the offensive end.  its like saying Ben Simmons is not DPOY material cause Mitchell score 33 on him."
Ben Simmons
"Idk about you but that‚Äôs no simple layup. Ben is a   stride ahead of Spida and the ball was going cross-court well ahead of both of them. Could have very well been a block/Simmons ball. That said, it DID hit the ref and WAS out of bounds. Refs still a dumbass though for being in the way and not blowing the whistle right away, and also not being clear after such a long review"
"I like how people (rightly) enjoy destroying shaq's old head takes on gobert bc he uses words like ""dominate"" and bc he is not a good post defender but then they use the exact same arguments as him in this kind of thread. Stop negating the value gobert brings on the defensive end.  If ben simmons or whatever other defensive expert on the perimeter got lit up by harden or curry or doncic lillard whatever nobody would tear down on him as much as they do with gobert."
Wait he's dating kendall? Ben Simmons?
"Even so, that arm position  by Donovan isnt illegal &amp; he's not getting his arm tangled with Simmons if Ben isnt reaching in.  Offensive ball handlers are allowed to have their off arms extended laterally like that, unless they're pushing off. Defenders aren't allowed to reach in from behind &amp; contact the ball-handlers arm when they spin.  *What is a reach-in foul in basketball? A reach-in foul is a term used to describe the defender attempting to reach in and steal or poke the basketball from the ball handler. In the attempt, the defender makes contact on the arms or impedes the ball handler‚Äôs natural progress or path in the course of a basketball move, in which a foul will be called against the player trying to steal the ball.*  It was a reach-in foul by Simmons."
but yo... THE REFS. Fun note this dude was being talked about being in the MVP discussion when he is having a good year at best. There is nothing special at all about his current season which is basically on par with all his other seasons. Ben simmons advanced metrics-------&gt;Dmitch but one guy is talked about for MVP and the other was shit on most of the season.
"Lol Dont believe me ? Please go watch it for yourself on the replay right here @19.53 https://nbafullhd.com/24141-2/ , you can CLEARLY see his hand when u pause the vid .   So as i said , he hooked around Simmons body as his arm is clearly extended and came with an upward motion and was called for the foul befor Ben had his arms clamped over . As shown by the replay you just watched at that time stamp .  Also , LOL @ at thinking it was MSFT Paint   https://imgur.com/a/VwQkWzy"
if this is 2k there would be no matchups... kyrie guarding ben simmons and we ain't calling timeout to change cuz we have no patience
"They have some of the best shooters in the league though, I hate everything about this. Like he took this shot on Ben Simmons as well, what did you think was gonna happen?"
I wanna see a Ben Simmons jump into a defender 3
"One is getting to the rim, the other is finishing once you get there. Ben Simmons is a great driver and can get to the hoop almost at will, but he‚Äôs a meh finisher."
Ben Simmons can
"gota love the Jazz commentators on the play Mitchell got ejected, ‚Äúoh there was a lot of contact there‚Äù, Simmons covered him like a blanket, the slow mo replay showed Ben didn‚Äôt touch him...‚Äùerrrrr, ummmm‚Äù"
I know isn't that crazy!? * Slowly looks over at Ben Simmons* Isn't that crazy Ben!?
"That was probably the most pro-Sixers call of the night, but not because Simmons hooked Donovan. I don't think either of them hooked enough for a foul to be called in the first place, but if he's blowing the whistle and putting it one way or the other, it still looked like DM hooked ben to me. Should have been a no-call and let them play on though imo."
"He‚Äôs a fraud, pumped up by a bunch of bad defensive metrics. How are you the best defender in the league if Ben Simmons can score 40 points in the paint against you? Who really thinks his defense is going to be ‚Äúelite‚Äù in the playoffs?"
what‚Äôs the Ben Simmons  equivalent to Mikal Jail
Steph curry is Ben Simmons level defense with a 3 it‚Äôs actually insane
"No, it will die when Ben Simmons retires."
"Morey said a couple of seasons ago there isn‚Äôt a single good publicly available defensive metric, and people still use them to write thousands of words.  Golbert‚Äôs defense is like the 2015 hawks offense: system based, over hyped in the regular season, unable to withstand greatness, and doomed to fail in the playoffs.  Do you really think Golbert would have an amazing defensive impact against the Lakers, clippers, or nugs in the playoffs? He wouldn‚Äôt, because teams actually game plan in the playoffs, and they would pull him out of the lane where he is useless. Ben simmons dropped 40 plus on his head for God‚Äôs sake.  He‚Äôs not a great defender, he‚Äôs a great regular season defender, and there‚Äôs a difference. He shouldn‚Äôt have been a 2 time DPOY and people should take him out of that conversation going forward."
Ben Simmons is passionate but doesn't go around beating up water containers and getting ejected. he's just all business on the court
I was just saying to another Redditor that the jump both he and Simmons have made this year is still shocking.  The craziest part is Joel is 26 and Ben is 24.  In 2 years they could be even better then they are right now.  Both of their ceilings are the best player in the league.  And people called us dumb for 4 years of losing for these two players.
"Embiid has Ben Simmons to back him up and he missed multiple games, something Harden even after partying that night never does.   Jokic has a sound argument BUT seeding does matter and fourth seed is the highest he‚Äôs going to get in a conference with the Lakers, Jazz and Clippers.  Again, being traded doesn‚Äôt disqualify you from the MVP race."
the ben simmons effect
Ben Simmons
"No, we need more Ben Simmons content!   LOL"
Yeah Ben Simmons went #1 and LSU didn't make the tournament
Ben Simmons can guard 1-5
&gt; It‚Äôs not his job to be a top 2 offensive option on the team.  slow down there sir this seems like a reasonable take on ben simmons.
https://www.awesemo.com/sideaction/ben-simmons-sister-claims-one-of-her-brothers-molested-her/amp/
"Ben Simmons - Lamar Jackson  Unorthodox players who are extremely good at what they‚Äôre good at, but have a massive flaw that everyone is waiting for them to overcome before they are truly described as ‚Äògreat‚Äô   (Yes Lamar has an MVP but I feel like it fits)"
‚ÄúWelcome to yourrrrr daily dose of Ben Simmons!!‚Äù
Kawhi wasn't viewed as an MVP level player being traded at the time though. He had mysterious injures and sat out for a year. If he was viewed as a player with MVP value they would've gotten more than DeMar DeRozan and a 1st.  They asked us for Ben Simmons at the time and we said no lol.
"Simmons aint on beals level lmao  CJ is. In the playoffs he is actually far more useful, Ben is just a defender at that point. CJ can hit tough shots in the half court"

"i don't disagree. cj's playoff value comes from his ability to buy a bucket, and this has saved us in the playoffs, most recently the nuggets series in 2019. However, i think we would be much better suited with a strong wing player. we've missed out on a variety of trades that could've better suited our team (harden, aaron gordon, gallinari to name a few) and ultimately we're worse off for it. my personal hope is to somehow get derozan this offseason, but we would need to probably sign and trade for salary purposes and the spurs dont need another guard. ben simmons could be a potential trade target if the sixers flame out in the playoffs this year. this comment ended up being a lot longer than intended, my b"
"Doncic teammates let him get the boards to pad his stats. Doncic is not a good rebounder. Doncic is a great passer and good at getting to the bucket and scoring. Doncic is not a good shooter. There are plenty of players who can do what Doncic does but I'll name 5 other than Russell Westbrook for you. Ben Simmons, SGA, LaMelo Ball, Jrue Holiday, Ja Morant."

Number 1 is absolutely a lie. I saw a thread of ‚Äúwho is better Ben Simmons or Trae Young?‚Äù And read some of the worst takes of all time.
sixers would be better with jalen brunson instead of ben simmons
This is why i hate the disrespect Ben Simmons gets. The way you have explained the multiplier/additive thing is excellent and describes players like CP3 and Simmons with low ppg but high game impact perfectly.

I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs the piece that needs to move personally, his trade value won‚Äôt reflect his talent level.   CJ and Dame is a great feel good homegrown story, but it‚Äôs not a duo that can win in the playoffs. A roster like the WCF rockets from a few years ago is our ticket. Get dame length and strength, between him norm and nurk we have three levels of scorer, CJ is redundant.   It pains me to say but yeah, as imaginary GM of the Blazers I would ship CJ and assets for a Ben Simmons type. Hope nurk stays healthy  Also utilize DJJ‚Äôs abilities above the rim to keep defenses honest but that‚Äôs the stotts discussion that I don‚Äôt even want to get into rn"
Dragic answering that old Ben Simmons shitpost by just passing the ball through the hoop
"Well they‚Äôre not going to win a ring with Ben Simmons starting, Embiid is a serious player and needs someone else if he‚Äôs going to win"
if only joel played the same amount of games and didnt have ben simmons.. Does your team have 2 centers on the court at all times?
"I said it in another topic but DPOY is the real narrative award. It's mostly eye test with voters. Best defender on an elite team, highlight worthy plays (like Heisman moments), primetime performances. The Ben hype train didn't start because of the media's well documented love for Ben Simmons, it started right after he locked Luka up in their last matchup. Then he locked Dame up (for Dame) in a game the Sixers actually lost. Dame had that late possession where he was clearly trying to go all Dame Time and Ben was having none of it. I heard about that play for days afterwards from all the talking heads. Again the Sixers lost that game.   The problem is advanced stats for defense is shit. Daryl Morey recently said he doesn't like a single one of them. There's just too much to factor in. Personally I would have Gobert 1st and Simmons 2nd because the Jazz have the best record in the league and will not get a single MVP vote for any of their players from someone who doesn't immediately want said vote taken away.   I don't think that it's laughable to give it to Ben though."
"Nah, that is Ben Simmons. He swallows them."
"Yes, but it would take everything you just said, plus Ben Simmons playing like he did before the all star game"
"That is why I specified the ben Simmons treatment ""on the perimeter"""
"ben simmons is still a scorer, just not a 3pt threat; draymond on the other hand is literally has to be playmaker because he doesn‚Äôt have a defender on his shoulders"
"The rankings:   **DPOY:**  1. Ben Simmons 2. Rudy Gobert 3. Bam Adebayo  **MVP:**   1. Nikola Jokic 2. Damian Lillard 3. Giannis Antetokounmpo 4. Joel Embiid 5.

"In the 2015-2016 season, he shot 38% on 3.2 3PA which helped the warriors absolutely fuck the rest of the league in the regular season. That season is a pretty big outlier for him in terms of shooting ability though. Obviously now teams give him the ben simmons treatment on the perimeter."
"I mean, I didn't say that at all, I said they were close and they are.   Embiid is so far better than anybody else in the east other than Harden and Durant, he's carrying at a near LeBron level and Harris is also better than Ben Simmons lmao."
Reminds me of a certain fanbase discussing Ben Simmons...
"lol.   I'll cry about it into my championship banner.   But also, Siakam and Lowry are better than Ben Simmons has ever been. OG and FVV are right there too. You can't control who misses how many games. Good luck not losing to the Celtics again in the first round, fingers crossed for you. It's too bad Jimmy left, nobody is afraid of you anymore."
"Adding % to make it easier, and sorting by %... (I'm trying to avoid doing real work).  Giannis: 32.7%   Kawhi: 25.8%   Embiid: 25.8%   Jimmy G. Buckets and the ""G"" stands for gets: 25.1%   LeBron: 23.2%   KD: 22.8%   Bam: 21.9%   Zion: 21.7%   AD: 20.8%   KAT: 20.6%   PG-13: 20.6%   Doncic: 19.7%   Harden: 17.1%   Ben Simmons: 15.7%   Steph: 15.3%   Lillard: 14.9%   Trae: 13.6%"
"That's a shame because as much as I hate Draymond's Ben Simmons imitation at the 3 point line, I think he would be a hell of a coach."
Ben Simmons would be legit on the Pistons. I don't know where else he would have a ton of value as a 1 or 2 option? Orlando? Not Cleveland or Minnesota or Washington for sure.
blame the cheapass Fertititties for being petty and choosing picks + dipo over Ben Simmons and Maxey
I definitely am thinking Lavine (due to standing) and Kyrie (if he missed any more games) won't make it to All NBA this year. CP3 and Booker may split voting between them. But there's also Ben Simmons and Trae Young on the peripheral as well.
I wouldn't even give Ben Simmons 40 a year right now and I think he's a better player. That contract was bad before the ink dried.
"Ben Simmons is a huge trash talker, which you wouldn't really expect based on his calm demeanor."
"I mean adding Ben Simmons, JJ Reddick, Helathy Embiid is what I consider major roster changes"
Ben Simmons shooting a 3 and AaronDidntMessUp's anxiety.
"Jamal has the IT factor he comes up big in big games, big moments and clutch shots. Ben Simmons doesn‚Äôt have that capability. Offense will always be more valuable than defense"
I mean I would rather have Jamal Murray than Ben Simmons for sure and Tatum is debatable
We tried but Fertita would have absolutely gutted our team for us to have James Harden. Our base offer of Ben Simmons alone is better than what they had easily but you get the drift.
Did harden trade himself there? Rockets could‚Äôve gotten Ben simmons
Embiid is a fucking clown that‚Äôs why. And Ben Simmons face.
"Sorry, what do you disagree with?  Ben Simmons benefits tremendously from having an elite rim protector behind him.  Rim protection is still the most valuable part of defense. Embiid is an elite rim protector. Therefore Embiid is the most valuable defender on the team. The 76ers have other solid perimeter defenders but have nobody else who can do what Joel does.  Tobias Harris is incredibly underrated, he's playing at nearly an all NBA level.  Ben Simmons is tremendously overrated. He does one thing at an elite level and even then he has the backing of another player who is even better than he is. I'm not saying he's a certified bum, he's definitely a starter level player in the NBA but lets stop acting like any team with Ben Simmons leading the way would ever get out of the first round.  Did I tell a single lie? Instead of attacking me as a person, try actually watching the games. BTW; if you haven't been watching the NHL this year you should give it a chance, pretty entertaining product with much less red-ball."
"I respectfully disagree. While Ben Simmons is taking the toughest defensive matchups, he's sheltered by the elite rim protection of Embiid. Joel is the best defender on that team and Ben Simmons contributions everywhere else are so extremely limited. I think Tobias and Ben Simmons are the most underrated and overrated players in the league respectively."
Nah Ben Simmons would still be around for you guys to hate on. You creeps will always have something to be angry about it's okay lil dude.
"Nah it's legit. Harris is the second best player on that team, consistently. Not even just shitting on Ben Simmons just giving my props to how excellent Tobias has been."
I‚Äôve been stacking rookie cards of this kid cuz I think he‚Äôs gonna be a highlight reel until he injures Himself trying to dunk on Ben Simmons and Joel embiid
So you haven't seen our opinion of Ben Simmons
No team with Embiid and Ben Simmons as the two best players will ever sniff a championship.
"For me at least, I criticize Ben Simmons bc he would 100% be a generational megastar IF he could just shoot well. Literally all other aspects of his game is elite. So when I see Ben Simons, I don‚Äôt appreciate his elite defense or playmaking, I just see the potential if could just shoot."
"chris paul, kyrie, luka, harden, lowry, jrue, ben simmons, trae, ja.  in no particular order&gt;russ"
It's about time he played well  Dude has been putting up Ben Simmons-esque statlines lately
"Harden, Luka, Chris Paul, Kyrie, Ben Simmons, Trae Young, SGA"
He‚Äôs like lite Lebron or what Lonzo was promised to be. Imagine 6‚Äô9 Jason Kidd or maybe Ben Simmons with better dribbling and a set 3 point jumper. He was fucking nasty. Could guard all 5 positions too. All time great
I mean...yea. Fucking Rockets.  Y'all could've had Ben Simmons except your trash organization was too petty to trade with the GM you chased away. Or at least kept LeVert.   Instead you got back...Kelly Olynyk and Avery Bradley on expiring deals. The four first round draft picks are all awful - Brooklyn and one from Milwaukee.
Joel and Harris are the dynamic duo on that squad though. Ben Simmons would be better on a team like the Pistons where he can be a 2 option.
Gonna give my best guesses here not in any particular order....  Zion  Luka  Tatum  Ja Morant   SGA (Shai Gilgeous-Alexander)  Jaylen Brown   Ben Simmons  Donovan Mitchell  Devin Booker  Brandon Ingram
Ben Simmons is genuinely not a championship quality third option.
"Thank you Ben Simmons, you kind, sexy man"
"Eh, IIRC your offer was simmons + 2 picks or simmons + thybulle and 2 picks, whichever one it was I‚Äôd rather have the nets deal. 4 picks and 4 swaps, a couple more picks we got for trading Oladipo/allen. How many picks could we have really for for simmons?   Sure, the nets picks will be useless the first few years. But when kd harden and Irving are near the end of there contracts the nets are not going to be good. Your picks would almost certainly fall within the harden/embiid timeline, and having simmons gurantees we lose out on the picks we traded to okc (top 4 protected)  I suppose if the wolves gave us ant+picks for Ben id do it, but I don‚Äôt know if that was on the table"
Was it really though? Ben Simmons is not that good
"I would say it‚Äôs at least close and there are good arguments for simmons&gt;trae.  Ben Simmons was an allstar this season, trae arguably got snubbed but did not make the team. Simmons was all-nba last year (as a guard), trae wasn‚Äôt close. Offensively trae is better, but even if Simmons can‚Äôt shoot well he‚Äôs still good on offense. Defensively Simmons was first team all-defense last year, probably gonna be on that team again with a shot at dpoy, trae is not a good defender."
"&gt;Yeah that's gonna be nothing compared to this. If Campazzo can floor Ben Simmons, Brown is gonna look like a train wreck.  &amp;#x200B;  How is this a good comparison?"
I would say Ben simmons imo.
Ben Simmons defense overrated
Ben simmons is overrated
"I believe in defense winning championships (here come the Nets to destroy that notion), so Ben Simmons.   But it's pick your poison. Both have an Achilles heel. Defense vs lack of shooting."
Ah Ben simmons vs Kemba Walker. The REAL matchup that absolutely noone talks about or cares about
What in the world? Did you just call Ben Simmons a liability in playmaking?
"You call them frauds and Embiid and Simmons aren't even fully in their prime yet.  This year has showed what Embiids prime can be, which is MVP caliber and Ben isn't even 25 yet lol"
"Yes, but the gap would be way narrower. It might  be 10 v 8 instead of 12 vs 4.5. That‚Äôs a huge difference.   Embiid isn‚Äôt the only comparison given that Jokic is 37th in FTA. He‚Äôs getting fewer calls than even historically disrespected players like Ben Simmons and Curry, even as the MVP favorite and a bruising center. Embiid is still closer to him in general scoring play style and effectiveness than pretty much anyone else. Jokic should probably be getting around as many calls as Jimmy."
Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons. Trae is nothing without his offensive fouls being called against the defense
And Embiid has Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons.
Wait I thought Ben Simmons is better than Steph Curry .....
"Ngl I've never understood the ""Ben Simmons is overrated"" crowd but this thread is extremely eye opening... like sheesh"
"Trae seems like he can lead a team and offense first guard like him don't need to improve that much on defense to be a net positive (see Dame).  Ben Simmons, I'll never get a clear read on until they tailor a team to him. Will he get that opportunity?"
"If you guys all wanna get technical, Ben Simmons is the best rookie defender."
"Simmons locked down Booker earlier this year before Doc decided to try Green on him instead, allowing Booker to get hot and make every shot, even when Ben was switched back on him"
You‚Äôre overrating ben Simmons on defense
"I don‚Äôt agree that you only have to hide Simmons shooting and that‚Äôs what I can‚Äôt get across to you. So many people think bens issue is just he can‚Äôt shoot. It‚Äôs not just that. He cannot drive to the rim cause his handle is below avg and he can‚Äôt finish through contact. When you combine that with a complete inability to shoot, you have a serious serious issue on your hands. Way more of an issue than traes defense. Cause now ben is almost useless if he doesn‚Äôt have the ball in his hands in the half court and if he does have the ball in his hands you are still insanely limited cause his driving game is so weak. Not only will he not shoot wide open shots but he wont drive either and make the defense collapse on him consistently cause he simply can‚Äôt do it. So what do you do with him in the playoffs? You make him primary ball handler and your team will never go anywhere. You admit defeat and make someone like jimmy butler primary ball handler and ben becomes nearly useless on offense maybe even negative if he‚Äôs paired up with a center like embiid.q"
"Trae is much easier to play with Simmons. Trae will take a team farther as the best player. And Trae can play with any position aside from his own. I can‚Äôt say the same for ben. Ben playing with a c or pf immediately becomes an issue if they can‚Äôt space the floor well. That is a huge issue. When you take Simmons and give him primary ball handling duties you are asking the gm to have to fill the rest of the lineup with all above avg shooters. If you take the ball out of Simmons hands, he becomes what he was in the series vs Toronto in 2019. He sits in the dunkers spot on offense and can provide elite perimeter defense. He‚Äôs not even that good of a rim protector. So even his defense is overrated. Ben Simmons isn‚Äôt nearly as versatile as everyone thinks he is."
"If you get some offensive threats into the lineup, and I mean at least Norman Powell type of threats- then it's Ben Simmons."
Ben Simmons vs The World!
Ben Simmons is a horrible fit with many superstars because he cannot do much of anything in the halfcourt offense. That is debilitating especially in the postseason. Ben Simmons best role would be like draymond. Slot him in as a pf next to a dame lillard or Steph curry. Meanwhile Trae young can pair up with any sg/sf/pf/c and it‚Äôs no issue. In fact he‚Äôs likely gonna make all those guys lives easier cause of his playmaking. Ben Simmons paired up with a big man like say Joel embiid is a big issue because ben Simmons has to hide in the dunkers spot whenever the game slows down cause he is useless on the perimeter. It is painful to watch that and see embiid have to post up against a guy and have another guy ready to help cause ben is so close to the rim. You are sleeping on how limited ben is in the playoffs.
Which hurts Ben Simmons game more than Traes.
Young isn‚Äôt just a scorer he avgs 10 assists a game  Trae young is already one of the best passers in the league while being a fantastic scorer. Trae young is gonna have a better career than iverson lol.    And again just lmao if you think you can build around ben Simmons and win a ring
Watch Ben Simmons vs a great defense in the playoffs and the answer becomes very evident
Ben Simmons what he does on the defesive end cant go unnoticed
"The only way the 76ers could see Miami in the conference finals (assuming the 6ers keep the 1 seed) is if we drop to 6. If they‚Äôre trying to avoid us until the conference finals, beating us last night would‚Äôve been extremely beneficial. And if the 6ers weren‚Äôt trying their hardest to win that game, which you‚Äôre insinuating, they would‚Äôve given Embiid another night off for recovery. The 6ers went into that game with the intention of winning. A win would‚Äôve guaranteed that they could rest their starters for the next two games. They got punched in the mouth (shoutout UD) and tried to get back in it until the 4th quarter rolled around. If your big surprise for the playoffs is just ‚Äúhaving Ben Simmons guard Jimmy Butler,‚Äù I don‚Äôt see y‚Äôall doing too well against us."
Mitchell is possible. Devin Booker too. And Ben Simmons.
"Magic Johnson was 2 inches taller, 30lbs heavier, and was an above average athlete, not even close as a comp.  The point is that athleticism is, and always has been, the limiting factor for any player in any sport.  In basketball, it even lets you get away with things like Ben Simmons, a guy who has no business being a good PG with his shooting, but more than makes up for it with size, athleticism, and explosiveness.  You take raw athleticism over intangibles every day when talking ceiling."
Yall got embarrassed last night. Ben Simmons never learning how to score and insisting on playing at gaurd makes you guys easy to defend
"What's Ben Simmons excuse? ""I'm not a scorer"""
Malik Beasley and Ben Simmons might be interested.
"For another bit of context, Thybulle's fouls per 36 minutes would be good for tied third most fouls per game in the league at 3.52. Meaning if he played 30-35 minutes there would be a non-negligible chance he fouls out of a game (KAT, with 3.7 fouls a game, has fouled out of a number of important fourth quarters).  He gambles on steals and blocks a lot, which can either go great or just end in a foul. This is also why his per36 steals/blocks numbers are so crazy - but defensive stats /= full picture of defensive value.  As has been said about defensive advanced stats, they don't give a shit who the player is, they just have to give some players credit for teams' defensive success. Sometimes it's accurate, often not. They are mostly tricked up plus/minus scores - meaning if you put the worst defensive player in the league alongside kawhi, gobert, AD, jrue, and simmons, they would end up being rated as a good defender because their lineup would never get scored on and they'd have very low points-against-average.  This is why Caruso and Drummond are so high: the Lakers have good defense and schemes. The same applies to Thubulle and the sixers (to a lesser degree - I believe Thybulle is genuinely a good defender (but absolutely not top 5), but it'll be proof of how players like ben and embiid can control media perceptions if he makes all-defense forward over draymond, bam, kawhi, or lebron.)"
I said the same thing about Ben Simmons in high school/college but he doesn‚Äôt look he‚Äôs going to be a top 10 level player
"I‚Äôd say Allen and Wood are superfluous. You would only keep one. Allen is gonna get paid after this season also.   It basically comes down to what you think of Simmons. I don‚Äôt think his offensive game is anywhere near good enough to build around as a primary option. Adding to that Simmons is not very scalable so if you bring in another primary ball handler it creates fit issues.  I‚Äôm not commenting if the trade was good, just on the notion of bottoming out vs trying to build a team around Ben Simmons. In my opinion bottom out may be the better option."
"Rockets could have had Jarrett Allen as well. A Ben Simmons, Christian Wood, Jarrett Allen core is pretty damn solid to build around."
"Lmao this dude thought Giannis + Embiid is worse than Ben ""not a scorer"" Simmons + Embiid on fkn offense"
"If we were just taking present-day Embiid and present-day Giannis, sure that's a pretty decent team (maybe not a great fit, but same has always been said about Embiid/Simmons). But I don't know how you get the present-day version of both of those players if they are trying to develop on the same team.    I thought in the early Jabari days that Jabari might become our go-to offensive star while Giannis remained a defensive dynamo who didn't score a ton but made plays for others (ironically, a lot like Ben Simmons). If Jabari (or Embiid in this hypothetical) had stayed healthy, I don't think we ever see 30 PPG MVP Giannis   Then you have the question of Embiid's health and his development. The Sixers were happy to let the Process unfold while he healed up, but I don't think Milwaukee would have had that luxury. There were all the pressures and questions around new ownership and a new stadium."
"Amongst NBA players and around the league this is true.   On here it really is mostly as superficial as ""He doesnt score and people dont like how he keeps getting awards and think he's overrated"". Its the same thing with Ben Simmons, around the league there are other reasons why I think people dont like him, on here its mostly just ""no 3s"" for why he's disliked. Not much deeper.   Not saying the mic thing helped Rudy, but people mostly just dont like a guy who they dont think is a ""modern day big"" who only gets 14 PPG getting all these accolades"
Because Ben Simmons is the guy the guy who doesn't respect his defence is in the running for dpoy
Players have their own agendas like Ben Simmons who wants to win dpoy. The MVP respects Rudy so much
"Embiid just came back from the flu, lets not get too too hype about a rest game. I love bam but lets not try to hand him a DPOY when Ben Simmons and Gobert exist in this league and have had the season on d they have had"

"im not a huge ben simmons fan, but i have him DPOY this year. His switch ability to guard 1-5 is amazing. His on ball defense is also what separates him from the rest."
&gt; Some people in Philly won‚Äôt like or agree with this  I love when clueless people pretend like they know more than others.  Ben Simmons himself has literally said this
"Ok. Ben Simmons is 2nd in line to win DPOY, Bam isn‚Äôt even top 5 according to Vegas and not even top 10 according to NBA.com rankings. The implication of OP is that Bam is more impactful as a defender than Simmons, that‚Äôs just a wild assertion."
As a Sixers fan I‚Äôm so curious about this matchup if/when we face Miami in the playoffs. You know Simmons will be on him all game and there‚Äôs A LOT of egos and pride at stake there from philly essentially choosing Ben as their primary ball handler over jimmy when he left which both Ben and jimmy weren‚Äôt willing to give that up so it clearly wasn‚Äôt gonna work both of them. I also think jimmy doesn‚Äôt like Ben bc of Ben‚Äôs like cool guy attitude and pretty boyness and hasn‚Äôt developed a jumper and imo prolly doesn‚Äôt work nearly as hard as he should which I also think Jimmu hates as well. I‚Äôm pumped to see them matchup and what scuffles and trash talking takes place haha
"Like I feel all those names that you mentioned are better than Ben Simmons on the defensive end. Sure he's more versatile, but Bam is having a great year, Draymond impacts the game more than he does, and most rim protectors matter more for the defensive scheme of the team.  Is it just because of self-promotion that he's top 2?"
Draymond has come up clutch in the playoffs and the Finals. I distinctly remember Ben Simmons disappearing during those last 5 minutes against the Raptors in game 7.
My point is Giannis centric offenses have been consistently slowed down late game in the playoffs. It‚Äôs clear you need another elite ball handler/scorer next to him if you‚Äôre gonna have a chance. An offense where Simmons plays the Giannis role is more or less that but worse in pretty much every way. Ben needs to be the second best player so he‚Äôs not the main focus of the defense.
You run your offense around Ben Simmons and you‚Äôre going to get destroyed in the playoffs. Everything that Giannis struggles with just amplified.
"man if there is one thing you cannot honestly call Ben Simmons it‚Äôs ‚Äúdefensively limited‚Äù  like respectfully, what are you seeing lol"
"I don't watch the sixers too often but I'll give my two cents. Ben Simmons is a great man to man defender, probs best in the league. But due to his position or ability all most those players you listed are better help defenders. I think in the current NBA help defense is so much more important than man to man. That's why I've always felt Ben Simmons has more 'bad' defensive games than his contemporaries. Cause if he's getting beaten man to man then there's not much more he offers than a replacement player.   I could be wrong, I don't watch them much. Any sixer fan care to comment and tell me I'm wrong?"

"First off, Holiday wasn't a top 30 player like Simmons. He was closer to top 100 than top 30. So even if the situations were comparable, the players aren't  Second off and more importantly, it's not valuing just Embiid over just Holiday, it's about where we were and where we needed to be. Our team was extremely mediocre but not bad enough to be in the lotto without any elite talent. AKA we were mediocre and going nowhere barring a miracle FA signing. That is NOT the position the wolves are in. They have KAT and D'lo who absolutely can be cornerstones of a competitive team going forward, IF they put the right players around them.   Which brings me to my next point: the lotto is a fucking crapshoot. Michael fucking Jordan went 3rd. Giannis didn't even get drafted inside the lotto. Players who haven't played a minute of NBA action are best viewed as HUMONGOUS QUESTION MARKS, barring someone like LeBron who's undeniably just a freak of nature.  So to conclude: when you don't have talent, you NEED those question mark players via the draft (unless you're the lakers) because you have no other ways of acquiring talent so you have to gamble on them and hope one or two of them turns out to be an elite player. When you HAVE talent, taking a gamble on one of those question marks who could be flipped for a high quality player (just to be clear, I wouldn't trade Ben for Cade and neither would Daryl Morey because that's not what our team needs right now) is extremely idiotic.  I'll end on this perfect example that happened before our very eyes: look at the Warriors right now. They could have traded the pick that turned into Wiseman and gotten a high quality contributor in return. Now instead they have a project player who's currently worth less than the pick it cost to get him. Could Wiseman end up contributing for them? BIG maybe, and if he does it probably won't fit their timeline. But had they swung the pick they DEFINITELY could have gotten an immediate contributor."
Ben simmons + 2nd rounder for Schroder + tht
That's irrelevant. Ben Simmons could be pulling up from 35 feet off balance with hot sauce in his eyes but it would still be a foul if he's touched in the air.
"ben simmons with a sports psychologist is up there with the great what-if players like d rose without the knee injury, len bias and motivated shawn kemp  i say that because as someone who only knows ben simmons through highlights and sparing national TV games, it seems like he'd play a perfect foil to a defense that's constantly switching with sixers shooters waiting on the wing. i was blown away by the fact he somehow plays more passively than bam in a matter of scoring"
"I will never understand how people don‚Äôt realize this, and make that same argument (see below) that you guys got nothing back from it.   I would take two first and a pick swap over Ben Simmons when starting a franchise. Giving me two more first and three more pick swaps is an easy choice. Plus u have assets and the nets might not be together long as we‚Äôve seen in the new nba free agency/trading"
"I thought it was renamed the Ben Simmons, but I guess I'm way too far from the future."
"You‚Äôre overrating some aspects. DLO is not a top 10 pg. 10 point guards that are better than him are Curry, harden, dame, luka, Westbrook, CP3, Ben Simmons, Fox, Trae, and Jamal Murray.   Also, I very much doubt they‚Äôre going to be a top 6 team next year. That means they‚Äôll have to be better than teams like jazz, suns, clippers, nuggets, lakers, 76ers, nets, and bucks. That just won‚Äôt happen. Timberwolves sound good on paper with KAT, DLO, and Edwards but other teams sound good on paper too. Heat for example check off basically every point that you stated. Bam is one of the best centers in the league. Butler is one of the best forwards in the league. Tyler herro was one of the best rookies as well. They have solid role players with nunn, dragic, robinson, igoudala, etc. were they a top 6 team this year? Nope. Granted they were riddled with injuries in the beginning of the year but still even when healthy I don‚Äôt think they were a top 6 team. T-Wolves have a nice big 3 but I don‚Äôt even think their big 3 is a top 10 big 3 in league for next year either. I have embiid, Simmons, and harris; giannis, middleton, and jrue; harden, Kyrie, and KD; bam, butler, and oladipo; Zion, Ingram, and lonzo; CP3, Booker, and Ayton; Jokic, Murray, and MPJ; Dame, CJ, and Powell; Steph, dray, and Klay; Lebron, AD, and Schroeder all as better big 3s"
Locked down Ben Simmons.
"Talking about the playoffs, where Embiid‚Äôs shooting splits have been ass in series where Simmons was playing. Teams don‚Äôt gameplan in the regular season like they do in the playoffs and offense is much less biased towards slow-paced halfcourt offense in the regular season. That‚Äôs the environment Ben struggles in, similar to the issues Giannis has (that are specific to the playoffs) but arguably worse. It‚Äôs not even debatable, Joel is a 43% career shooter in the playoffs for a reason."
Please watch film or Sixers games and tell me it's 5v4. Or don't. I don't care. If you think Joel is scoring 29 ppg and shooting the percentages he's shooting while Ben is doing nothing but taking up space you're insane.   I've seen every Ben Simmons game since he came into the league and he has been extremely valuable from the dunker's spot where Doc likes to put him. (and his preference for three out and not four out predates Ben). Watch Sixers games and tell me that the team is playing 5 on 4 with Ben out there.
Yeah man exactly. Plus Ben Simmons didn‚Äôt want to be in Houston
ben simmons
Ben Simmons guarded Duncan Robinson all tonight (which to his credit he did do well)  Duncan aint no Embiid though.
"Meanwhile Ben Simmons guarded Duncan Robinson all night lmao. Honestly, Bam and Gobert both deserve DPOY over Simmons. He's a very overrated defender. Do sixers fans even think he's the best defender on the team?"
"One of these pairs of players are MVP and DPOY candidates, and the other pair are Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons"
"**I love Ben Simmons**, I think he's a star.   THAT BEING SAID, This fit just does not work against elite teams. Having Embiid, an MVP candidate, throwing the ball from the 3 pt line INTO the post to Ben Simmons should be a fucking basketball crime."
Rudy Gobert. Ben Simmons has also missed quite a few games this season.
Why is DPOY Ben Simmons guarding one trick pony 3p shooter Duncan Robinson over Jimmy Butler
"At the half  Ben Simmons: 16 minutes, 6 points, 2 rebounds  Udonis Haslem: 3 minutes, 4 points, 1 rebound"
One off season with me and Ben Simmons will be the mvp frontrunner next season
Ben Simmons uses the as val
Thank you Ben Simmons.
Ben Simmons lives rent free in your head.
This reffing is heavily biased for the Heat. Why are the refs forcing Ben Simmons to guard Duncan Robinson instead of Jimmy Butler? So unfair!
Bam Adebayo &gt; Ben Simmons  And it aint even close
"Why the fuck is ""DPOY Ben Simmons"" on Duncan Robinson?  So fucking overrared ong"
"Ben Simmons is supposed to be DPOY and he checking Duncan Robinson? Most overrated ""Star"" in the league  Hes not even a true star"
Ben Simmons is just a taller michael carter williams
Ben Simmons is the msot overrated player in the league
Yo wtf did Ben Simmons do to you?
Ben Simmons Ben Gordon Ben Wallace Ben Franklin Ben 10
Ben Simmons is the exact opposite of Markelle Fultz and it‚Äôs insufferable.
Ben Simmons if they don't get an ECF berth     Also Kevin Porter Jr.
"The Ben Simmons special.  Interesting enough, they're both #1 overall picks. They could become absolute beasts with a little more drive on a consistent basis rather than kick if ya know what I mean. Both already solid players, but would love to see both hit strides in the playoffs/going into next season."
"PG has more experience in the post season than Ben Simmons, who‚Äôs half court game is still questionable. Also, Nets are overwhelming favorites in the East so they probably going by the fact that the expectations of Philly is lesser than the Clippers."
Because Ben Simmons exists
"Wilt, Moses, Dr. J, Iverson, Barkley, Embiid  Hal Greer, Mo Cheeks, Billy Cunningham, Iggy, Bobby Jones, Ben Simmons"
Not sure if ‚Äúwildly overrated‚Äù is how I‚Äôd describe him. Length and size are two things Luka has trouble with and Ben Simmons are both of those things. Luka seemed to have figured out how to create his own space in their last matchup but in their previous battles Simmons has done a better job on him than anyone I‚Äôve seen
Ben Simmons
"I want some size! **Ben Simmons - Paul George - Kristaps Porzingis** (only for 3-pointers and back-up defender) - **Anthony Davis - Rudy Gobert** (for me Mitchell number 1 at Jazz because of usage and his clutch time role). Maybe it's not most powerfull team, but I would watch this team play once!"
Ben Simmons. Mans been begging for a DPOY this whole season and sending shots at Rudy for no reason
Kyrie.   Fucker tries to sound so profound then says earth is flat and uses a walking stick.  Luka - crybaby with jay cutlers double chin  Pat Beverley - if you told me he smoked a whole bunch of crack before the game I‚Äôd believe you  Ben Simmons - just can‚Äôt stand looking at him looks like a zit with googly eyes or a white mans nut with one side groomed
Ben Simmons
&gt;That dude is the best Luka defender in the league.  Might want to look at the games against Ben Simmons. Plus the Clippers locked down Luka last year in the regular season and he did just fine in the playoffs.
"Wdym? He dominated in the bubble, and in the Celtics sweep.   Ben Simmons was playing the best basketball he had ever played last season, especially in the bubble. When you pull him for injury on this already discombobulated team, they‚Äôre gonna lose.  It‚Äôs kinda stupid to say he didn‚Äôt show up. He did lose, but he was the only one pulling them through. He almost stole a win game one against the Celtics.   Not sure why you‚Äôre salty man."
My guess is Dearon Fox and Brandon Ingram. I could see Ben Simmons either being traded or asking for one if he keeps regressing on offense or the team has a couple more early exits
Well that or Ben Simmons and his jumper
Ben Simmons?  PG: Ben Simmons / Malcolm Brogdon Marcus Smart  SG: Terry Rozier / Alec Burks / Buddy Hield  SF. Mikal Bridges / Norman Powell / Gary Trent Jr  PF: OG Anunoby / Jerami Grant / Marcus Morris  C: Myles Turner / Nikola Vucevic / Jakob Poeltl
So what does defending Ben Simmons make you? ü§î
Ben Simmons disagrees
"I actually think it‚Äôs the defense.  The reason Ben Simmons can be a point guard is because he can defend the position, Zion has to play PF because that‚Äôs his only defensive position."
"Keep in mind Facilitating and Shooting have been proven to improve over time. I don't see why he couldn't play at a smaller position later down the road. Obviously he is dominant inside but I think he could have a Ben Simmons type effect at the guard spot, excelling at defense and transition offense."
Ben Simmons? He deserves the award more
Ben Simmons would be screwed
Two things: Teams doubling Embiid with Simmons‚Äô man on every possession and doc‚Äôs rotations. We get hammered in Ben+Dwight minutes and Mike scott better not play a second of playoff basketball
Im sure you‚Äôll manage. The sympathy for Ben Simmons last year never even started
"Gotta agree, but not because of stat padding. It's so easy to have a tripple-double these days. Just look at Joker, Luka, or Ben Simmons. They are 26, 24 and 22. And already 9,11 and 13 all time.  At this rate all 3 of them will have more than Oscar before they retire."
Till antetobrick gets the build a wall in the paint treatment and Ben ‚Äúdraymond‚Äù Simmons shows up
"&gt; Ben Simmons talking about how bad we are while playing fortnite and then proceeding to absolutely shit on us  Actually it was KAT that proceeded to absolutely shit on you with like 50 points or whatever, Ben was just the one who instigated it by being like [""nah you have plenty of time [to play, if it's the Hawks]""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypjLGtdc8WQ) while playing games with KAT lol  &gt;rebuild.  But congrats on the rebuild! I'm really glad Nate's working out for you as a coach. I've been following you guys basically since the beginning of your rebuild as a really interesting story in the East. IMO it's been one of the best ""rebuilds"" I've seen recently."
"What you need to understand is how you define positions isn't how everyone else defines them.  It doesn't make them idiotic, they just have a different opinion, and that's ok lol.  How do you define positions? I'd assume you consider Ben Simmons a forward then?  Jokic isn't a PG because he isn't the main ballhandler, he's just the main playmaker. A PG for me is usually the main ball handler AND main playmaker."
Yea.... idk why I immediately thought of ben simmons.
"yea I feel bad for Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid, JJ Reddick"
"&gt; Ight they‚Äôre supposed to have idiotic biased takes  Well, calling a person an idiot for thinking Simmons should be DPOY is the height of idiocy in of itself. NBA.com has had Rudy and Simmons as the #1 on their DPOY ladder most of the season and Rudy has only just [retaken the top spot](https://www.nba.com/news/defensive-player-ladder-rudy-gobert-or-ben-simmons-race-enters-final-week) from Simmons. Personally, and even as a Simmons fan, I think Rudy will get the award but suggesting that the notion of Simmons being in the hunt is ludicrous is just dumb. He's right up there."
"I watched almost every single game of our rebuild. The emergence of John Collins, Dedmon learning how to shoot threes, the unrivaled athleticism of Alex Poythress, Ben Simmons talking about how bad we are while playing fortnite and then proceeding to absolutely shit on us, Alex Len batting Traes' lobs directly out of bounds with his cinder block hands... It wasn't always fun but I'm so glad I stuck it out, I love watching this team. Happy to be back!"
"Gobert is on a tier by himself. AD, Giannis, Embiid, Turner, Kawhi, and Draymond all have an argument over being better defenders than Simmons. Pick any four you want to fill out the top five but if you leve Ben off your list I won't argue with you."
"I mean given the last half of the season. Especially Westbrooks April and May(so far) he's probably a top 6 guard in the league.   I'm not sure what amount of games disqualifies a player but has Harden played enough games for us to consider him all-nba this year?(42 to Westbrooks 62)   Like off the hop for guards we have Dame, Steph, CP3, Donovan, Butler, Westbrook, kyrie, Harden, Beal, Ben Simmons?, Trae.. I'm sure I missed some. But do we consider him top 6 out of those guys?"
"I wouldn‚Äôt say so but they are pretty close.  Both are damaging scorers so it depends on do you value Russ being a better shooter (lowest of bars) and maybe a better finisher (debatable) with better rebounding and passing over Simmons much more elite defense.  For PGs I‚Äôd have Russ clearly below Steph, Kyrie, Dame, CP3, Jrue, Trae Young, Jamal Murray, and it‚Äôs debatable if he‚Äôs better than Ja Morant, Lowry, FVV, Ben Simmons, Conley, Kemba.  He falls somewhere in that range.  I‚Äôd personally have him 11th behind Lowry, Morant and Simmons but you can argue he‚Äôs better than those guys.  Ultimately it‚Äôs his efficiency tha hurts him because even his bad defense can be excused as a guard but I‚Äôd feel much better about him if he shot less and just focused on more of his awesome rebounding and playmaking."
"I give the 76ers a lot of credit for slowing down kawhi Leonard, but also you have to remember that the dude looked hobbled as the series went on. He didn't have the same lift and explosiveness consistently towards the end. I credit injury + ben Simmons as primary defender for slowing down the onslaught he was dishing out  Dude was legit a beast that series, the rest of the Raps looked scared to shoot. Fully carried us that series but we got him back as a team later on"
"I can't believe you wasted the Ben Simmons Donovan Mitchell joke, an absolute motherfucking shame"
"I instantly scrolled down to Ben Simmons and was hoping to find it replaced by Donovan Mitchell lmao. Was rather disappointed.  I don't even have a problem with Simmons winning, I just thought it'd be funny."
Ben Simmons robbed far too many times
This is an impressive amount of work and you didn't even shit on Ben Simmons
It should be Ben Simmons...  Literally back down Trae. It‚Äôs not that hard.
Only Ben Simmons is able to clamp up a team on his own night in and night out.   That team = 76ers
Superstar. Ben Simmons. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
"Unreal that Simmons has no interest in developing a jump shot. Like it‚Äôs a fundamental part of the game of basketball. Just shooting the ball. Even if you ignore that it‚Äôs a basic fundamental, running around and shooting the ball is just‚Ä¶ *fun.* Hard to imagine that in all the years growing up, Ben Simmons never bothered to appreciate a good ol‚Äô pull up jimbo"
That depends if you know Ben Simmons actually sucks.
Sixers fans turning on Ben Simmons is the funniest shit I‚Äôve seen in a minute hahaha
Posting this after Ben Simmons had a very bad game. C'mon
"Why would the blazers do this? CJ made a huge mistake this playoffs but why would you trade him for a player that can‚Äôt shoot? Simmons best skill is his passing, and he‚Äôs not gonna be the primary ball handler on the blazers. Ben wouldn‚Äôt fit on the blazers as a PG or a PF. If the blazers trade CJ, it‚Äôs gonna be for a better fit."
At least giannis is willing to look silly shooting jumpers. Ben Simmons being paid like a superstar for his intangibles.
"the 76ers are locked to ~$92.5m this season on 3 players. tobi @ ~$33.5m, embiid @ ~$29.5m, and simmons @ ~ $29.2m. rounded up on the total for the other digits not being shown.  in the last two games, during the 4th quarter, these three players are:  tobi: 0/5 fg embiid: 1/10 fg simmons: 0/0 fg  the entire team scored 9 baskets in the fourth in games 4 and 5. two games where they rolled over and gave up double digit leads.  and i'm sure this is all on the players, aside from ben just being hot ass as usual. the way this team has completely broken down on both ends is eerily similar to the collapse the clippers had last postseason.   looking like fire doc was the right call. look what the clippers did tonight instead."
"I thought Simmons was 6'8"", not 6'11"" and was going to say no where close to 5, more like 3"". But since he grew to 6'11"" I think 5"" is reasonable as a threshold where current Ben Simmons if shrunk to that size would be in the G league. A 6'6"" Ben Simmons is worse than MCW and he barely gets playing time."
"Taking 4 shots in a playoff game as one of the leading players in your team is inexcusable, I get Ben Simmons doesn‚Äôt have a jumper but come on man."
Ben Simmons overrated
"In his defense, idk how the fuck you win in tight games with Ben Simmons. He completely fucks your rotations in the 4th quarter if the other team plays hack-a-ben."
Just blame Ben ‚Äúunplayable in crunch time because he doesn‚Äôt practice freethrows‚Äù Simmons
"Yeah you‚Äôre probably right, I just feel like there is other avenues to maximize trading away Ben Simmons. But CJ running with Embiid / Seth / Harris does not sound bad at all"
"I agree but it's all in the context of his contract. You immediately put a ceiling on your team if you have Ben Simmons on it.  He's on a max contract and doesn't provide any offense unless someone else creates it for him. So it's not just a max contract required to have him, it's his contract plus someone else's who can create."
"Legit I don't know what Doc should've done in this situation. He had all the guys out there he really should have had out there at the end of the game. The team was flat and played like shit. They needed to make stops to end the Hawks run, but they literally can't put Ben Simmons out on the court without ending up losing at the free throw line.  If there's a singular dude who should be blamed for their 4th quarter troubles, it should be Ben Simmons. He's an all-nba Point Guard and All-Star who is shooting fucking *thirty percent* from the line in the playoffs and does next to nothing for your offense. And it's not like he has been slowing down Trae Young either, he has been flat useless outside of a blocked 3 point attempt. He is being exposed, *hard.*"
"Why the Derozan slander? Replace Ben with him on this game and he'll space the floor better than Simmons. Better shooter, good enough playmaking and you can hide him with this Sixers defence."
The Ben Simmons experiment needs to be shut down.
Ben Simmons.
Would you guys take CJ for Ben Simmons? We can throw in some fillers.
Joel Embiid with one knee better than Ben Simmons with two confirmed. Simmons really needs to stop pretending him not being able to shoot is not a massive problem every time they get to the playoffs.
Ben Simmons is useless in the playoffs. He's easily exposed. You cannot get away with not being able to shoot in today's NBA no matter how talented you are at everything else.
"I feel like what Barkley said ""The Bucks are going to win the championship, but they play the dumbest basketball"" could apply equally to the Sixers.   At least Giannis can run and dunk... I don't know what the hell Ben Simmons is doing out there. He's putting up 2020-2021 regular season Draymond Green numbers in the playoffs with less than half his free throw percentage."
"If you want a genuine answer, they were in the bonus, which means the idea is just to foul Ben Simmons and take him to the line.  They did get some genuine stops which are a head scratcher to me"
Ben Simmons is nothing a role player
"Listen man, I don‚Äôt know what to tell you if you think there‚Äôs people on this sub giving Ben the work in a jump shot contest on a regular ass court. I don‚Äôt think y‚Äôall understand the difference between the two. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm Being trolled or people here are that delusional. Andre Drummond has maybe the worst handle and shot in the league and misses from one foot away. Look at his high school clips against top Comp, he had insane handle and was hitting jump shots and running point.    I feel like I‚Äôm taking crazy pills. No one here could touch Ben Simmons in a jump shot competition. Get a grip."
"After an extremely short google search I found this article: https://thesixersense.com/2016/05/25/does-ben-simmons-have-work-ethic-concerns/  But really, do you need an article? Go look at his bb ref page I linked: https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/simmobe01.html  What is preventing him from shooting a higher FT %? You could go out and shoot 100 FTs a day starting tomorrow and you would improve. He's still shooting a historically bad % for a player at his position.   His rookie year, 18% of his shot attempts were between 10-16 feet and he made 31% of them. Last season, 4% of his shot attempts were between 10-16 feet and he made 15% of them. Go look at his stats. Seriously. He is regressing. FGA are down but it's not like his assists are up. Rebounds are down. He's not excelling in any statistical category. Players, especially ones drafted as high as him, are projected to get better over time as they age.   I'd love to hear another explanation for why a professional basketball player of his caliber isn't getting better if it isn't a work ethic issue."
This is a long winded way to say Ben Simmons also sucks at defense cause he got cooked by a team that doesn‚Äôt even pass the ball.
Ben Simmons with 1 FGA. Yikes.
Ben Simmons is already getting shit on for being more useless than Lonzo Ball on offense. You want us to shit on them more?
Zion had more threes in his NBA-debut than Ben Simmons has had for 5 years
"Giannis and Ben Simmons seem to be converging on the same player archetype, with Simmons having more passing ability and Giannis having more outside shooting proclivity if not accuracy."
What? Really? Because Ben Simmons is good as fuck but he doesn‚Äôt really fill the score sheets. What do you mean?
"I‚Äôm American too and would always play at Liberty park and dolphin park had Jamal Crawford and tons of legends grow up talking trash, kings court all the time. Ben Simmons was giving grown ass men the work and talking shit, that‚Äôs literally the spirit of outdoor hoop culture. Y‚Äôall lame af for thinking THATS an insult"
"Simmons is not single handily responsible for a blown 26 point lead.   The sixers blew an 18 pt lead last game and now a 26 point lead. Not to mention the Clippers blew 3-1 series lead last year. Doc is the common dominator.   Granted, Ben Simmons being donkey water at FT shooting and having an ass jumper doesn‚Äôt help. But Ben isn‚Äôt why they lost."
Ben Simmons making that much money is what‚Äôs wrong with this league. Legitimate bum
"Didn't watch the game, but geez that free throw stat for Ben Simmons isn't great."
wait so ben simmons really imagines every other player is a part time milkman/math teacher/accountant like they were in the 40s? wow
You are overrating Ben by a huge margin. Beal for Simmons is fair.
"Embiid gasses out, Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris were born with a missing clutch gene"
"I don‚Äôt think it was ever in the sixers hands was it? To answer your question, I mean, I enjoy watching those guys, I love having them on the team. Harden and embiid would be better than Simmons and embiid, obviously. And if they won the chip? Yeah I‚Äôd be happy. But I probably would‚Äôve always thought ‚Äòwhat if‚Ä¶‚Äô. Last year Simmons being out proved it wasn‚Äôt him holding us back, but this year? I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt know what this year has proven. Ben and Joel haven‚Äôt been in the negative as a duo on the +/- yet, but what does that prove? Simmons being off the team would probably improve my mental health one way or the other haha"
Allow me to remind you all that Ben Simmons was selected as an All-Star and Trae was not...
"Ben Simmons gets run off the court. No shot, no layup package, no free throws. Waste of cap space. Trade him for John Wall. The sixers would be better off."
TIL Ben Simmons is Australian
Yet here you have the guy who invented 3&gt;2 on a team with Ben Simmons who has the skillset of a 1940s PG
Ben Simmons needs to shoot free throws granny-style.  It works.
"&gt; but for the vast majority of offensive stars if you're busting your ass and leading your team in scoring on one end, you really don't have to do much on defense, take it as easy as possible honestly.  well you can do that but you arent going to win in the playoffs that way  people criticize curry and jokic's defense all the time, kyrie is an average or even above average defender for his position and size so he doesn't get criticized for it very much.  jokic's bad interior defense is one of the biggest reasons the nuggets rarely get to the later rounds of the playoffs  sixers have three volume scorers, why would trading ben simmons for another one make any difference"
"De'Aaron Fox for Ben Simmons, Isaiah Joe/Paul Reed and a first round pick in the 2022 draft. Do the kings accept?"
"De'Aaron Fox for Ben Simmons, Isaiah Joe/Paul Reed and a first round pick in the 2021 draft who says no?"
&gt; Thinking anyone on this sub could take on Ben Simmons  Tbf he did say in a shooting contest.
Ben Simmons needs to admit that he is right handed.
"""Mitsubishi Mirage"" and ""proud owner"" are words that have never been used together in a sentence before. But it sounds like your Mirage does you well. I didn't mean to disrespect your car like that. My apologies. Maybe one day Ben Simmons can evolve into something reliable like your Mirage, but it doesn't look likely."
Are you for real? Mitchell has played well this while series while down his point guard and finally had one off night where his bum ankle fucked him over and he made some bad decisions trying to kick himself into gear. Ben Simmons just sucked ass and his team blew a 26 point lead.
Ben ‚Äúhe does so many other things for the team‚Äù Simmons
You just cannot win with Ben Simmons being inconsistent smh..He is obviously great but having games like this is unacceptable man.I dont know what the future plan is for Philly if they lose this series.  Cause running it back next year is a very bad idea
Seth and Simmons should just morph into one player. They can go with Seth Simmons or Ben Curry.
Harris typically should have been able to feast but for whatever reason he was in the Ben Simmons Zen Passiveness state today
Bud is the worst coach in the league.  Ben Simmons is an G leaguer.  Gobert is fraud DPOY.
"I agree that no one wants to watch Ben Simmons play like he did tonight, too."
I don‚Äôt care about the choke. Ben Simmons was 4/14 from FT. How the fuck can you be so bad at shooting? Basketball is your fucking job.
Been telling people Ben Simmons ain't shit. And him and Giannis will never win a championship for the same reason: can't neither of them shoot. If I was the Philly front office I'd be seriously considering trading him.
can you guys stop talking about ben simmons for one game lmfao
tobias harris and ben simmons forgot they were playing a basketball game
"Ah, I got it. All it takes is the coach *telling* Simmons to score buckets, why hasn't anyone considered this before?   [Ben Simmons wins a scoring title if this was his coach](https://streamable.com/r2p4b7)"
"The Wizards looked very content letting Brad Beal try to break down Thybulle and Green while Westbrook tried driving on Ben Simmons. Also, the Hawks were not attacking Seth that much before today."
76ers baby Ben Simmons. The whole organization is scared to hold him accountable.
"not unless they can get Jaylen back. Remember, they were originally trying to get Harden for Ben Simmons so they believe they can get a borderline all-star wing back."
Lmao ben simmons shooting stroke  Also Dinwiddie out for the Nets.
"As a proud owner of a mitsubishi mirage seems I need to defend the car. For 5 years has been reliable and taking me whatever I need. On time, low maintenance, cheap. Ben Simmons is like a restored car from the 1920s; expensive, need to be pampered but only good for a 1-h parade."
Ben Simmons demands a recount
Ben Simmons 4-14 on Free throws in a 109-106 playoff game.  Dudes gotta go
"Agreed and it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs an elite playmaker. It‚Äôs pretty much him just running into the paint and then dumping it back to a shooter behind him for a semi contested shot.   He is not an offensive creator either, he can‚Äôt shoot 3s or FTs. So pretty much his only valuable asset is his defense and even with that it‚Äôs not that impactful because Hawks routed them.  I‚Äôve always thought that the idea of Ben Simmons is better than actually paying him and having him on your team.  That‚Äôs why Sixer fans still defend him and bring up all his accolades when he gets criticized."
"I‚Äôm not expecting Ben to be a lights out shooter , but at least keep the defense honest and make even a 15 footer once in a while. That would open so much for his team and himself honestly  Being good in the midrange would work wonders for Simmons , ask a guy like DeMar who made himself a name just by dominating the midrange"
Timberwolves probably give up Beasley Rubio and a pick tbh. Ben Simmons would play way better next to KAT
PETA will tweet to Ben Simmons
how can you win in the clutch when you have Ben Simmons on the floor lol
Ben Simmons hates pussy
Ben Simmons = Andre Drummond  Both have become exposed
Jaylen brown. Not close. Only philly fans think Ben Simmons can net someone like James harden/dame kind. Like the other side will hang up asap
BEN SIMMONS IS A ROLE PLAYER DON‚ÄôT @ ME
[Ben Simmons] (https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c7/ab/c1/c7abc1e1ab8fe7b7f80d036176e12fff.jpg)
Ben Simmons is a cat hater confirmed
"Another wish requested by Izzy. ""Ben Simmons to lower me to my grave, so he can let me down one more time"""
Ben Simmons catching fair share of the mockery
"He‚Äôs not a good defender at all.   It‚Äôs easier to hide a bad defender as compared to whatever Ben Simmons does, but yea he‚Äôs all offense.  People just assume that any nba player that isn‚Äôt undersized is a good defender when they have a good build but it‚Äôs just not true.  Celtics fans like to talk up his D, but if he plays well at the end of game 3 vs the raptors I think they get past the heat. They were completely gassed games 1-2.  If they get past the heat and give Hayward time to come back they win the ring imo."
Ben Simmons MVP for the Guangdong Tigers 2025
The idea of Ben Simmons is better than the actual reality of having Ben Simmons  Sixer fans mention his accolades like all that matters. Dude is not that guy at all.  Your ceiling as a team is capped if he‚Äôs starting for you
Ben Simmons made a cat sad
"Tatum killed us that series. Tatum has career averages of 18/6/2 on .412/.349/.820 against Philly, mainly because of Simmons. Philly was also 3-1 against Boston in the 19-20 regular season.   At the very least having Ben last season gives Philly a couple wins, if not the series."
Ben Simmons cannot be forgiven for this
"I will never, ever understand the Ben Simmons hype."
"Tobias has separated himself from Ben imo. He‚Äôs played well enough this season to be a solid second option on most teams, even an ECF team from what I‚Äôve seen. On the other hand, Ben Simmons looks like a 3rd option at best"
"Ben ""Quack"" Simmons"
dude seriously ben simmons sucks
Excuse me sir the only player allowed to be exposed tonight is Ben Simmons or have you not seen all the threads.
"No, they would trade Ben Simmons"
Why is everyone shitting on Ben Simmons when Tobias Harris went 2/11?
"Ben Simmons, that was the answer you were looking for right?"
"Ignore the stats for a second.    A 6'1 SG, who is horrible defensively, cannot playmake at all, and is due for a max contract. He cannot play PG, so you need a a PG next to him. Your PG can't be another small guard, so you'd need a bigger one like Lonzo Ball or Ben Simmons or something.     He's an extremely limited player who only does 1 thing at a high level (scoring a lot of points on average efficiency). He's also hard to fit into a lineup because of his size and the aforementioned limitations.    He's definitely a solid player. He's also definitely not worth a max contract.   In my eyes he's best suited to being a 6th man off the bench. Could rack up some 6MOTY selections that way and chuck as many shots as he wants without being asked to be a playmaker."
"Reading comprehension isn't your strong suit is it? I didn't compare Ben Simmons to Giannis and Shaq. I was alluding to people that swear by per game/per 100 stats think BS is better than he is. Just like framing these stats to say Giannis is playing as well as peak shaq. It's nonsense, but the numbers don't lie..."
both these guys are easily better than ben simmons...  trade for him with pelicans assets if you love him so much
People are saying he‚Äôs putting up empty stats. I personally disagree and alongside a Ben Simmons type would be a star
I bet you think Ben Simmons is dope at basketball.
"Personally, I don‚Äôt think Ben Simmons was ever overrated. I feel like he was always shit on, just even more so now."
Is this you Ben Simmons?
"It will be Ben Simmons, after the Sixers trade him for peanuts."
Ben Simmons. Most underrated player right now. Anyone want to trade?

He and Ben Simmons are the only dudes who get sucked off for scoring 8 points
Ben Simmons
Go all in and try to get Ben Simmons. He has his flaws but he has superstar talent. Fits dame well. Cj + 2 frps.
"I think Siakam and Ben are still in the mix.  I‚Äôd say  Tier 1A: Brown, Siakam, Murray, Simmons, Siakam Tier 1B: Ingram, Sabonis  Tier C: LeVert, Dejounte, Brogdon, Beasley, Zubac"
Ben Simmons - Physically and mentally.
Putting Ben Simmons in this list requires balls. Kudos for that.
Ben Simmons is 25
Ben Simmons is better than Giannis at wasting his talent.  You're welcome
"Barkley is an odd one to throw in there with Hakeem and Malone, as well as the fact the next Chuck has already been kind of established to be Zion lol.   But for real Embiid was neck to neck with Jokic before his injury, and if not for Brick Simmons he would be playing in the finals rn. No way does Brooklyn close them out if Ben was replaced with even De‚ÄôAaron Fox, and considering the Bucks struggles all throughout the playoffs leading up to the finals I‚Äôd place money on the sixers.   Also it‚Äôs unreal just how well Embiid has performed considering the detriment to spacing and offense that Ben Simmons guaranteed in the playoffs, so after they trade him for somebody willing to play offense aggressively we may see even greater efficiency from him."
"He was good after Houston stopped playing centers to cater to him. Problem was they met the Lakers in the playoffs and lakers sagged off him like he was Ben Simmons and doubled harden.  That series vs. the lakers soured general nba opinion about Westbrook, and he turned it around this season by dragging the wizards to  the playoffs"
Horrible Defender and Ben Simmons level of shooting. Still a great Player but many People have told me Zion is better than somebody like Tatum
Ben Simmons hasn‚Äôt been overrated by this sub for like 3 yrs
Giannis is better than Ben Simmons. Try telling me I can‚Äôt prove this lmao.
"We don't have many choices. Most trades we could do would end with the Sixers being a worse team than this past season. Dame would be great, but that's a long shot. Simmons is just entering his prime playing years - he's going to come back next year a better player. Of course if he does that on a new team, people will think he just needed a change of scenery, but I think he'll do it regardless. Basketball fans have short memories - a few good games from Ben to start the season and they'll forget all about it. People have been too impatient with these guys. Embiid has a good 4-5 years left (or more) and Simmons has even more, and both have just hit their prime."
It's officially been enough time that a majority of the people on this sub will pretend they didn't just watch Ben Simmons shit himself in front of millions of people apparently
I. Andre Drummond 2. Kyle Kuzma 3. Ben simmons
Lol someone said Ben Simmons
"He was before my time, lol. I mostly meant that in today‚Äôs game teams would try to send him to the line as frequently as Simmons. I feel like Big Ben would mentally be able to handle it much better than Simmons, but it doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs gonna shoot well enough to stay on the floor offensively"
"Shitty thing about this postseason is that my go-to answer is no longer overrated (Ben Simmons).   Off the top of my head, Jimmy Butler or Julius Randle"
"Except he lacks one of Draymond‚Äôs best attributes. Confidence. Dude is one of the least confident players I‚Äôve ever seen. He took about one shot outside 8-feet per game last year. Look it up. I shit you not.   If you don‚Äôt surround him with shooters, any Ben Simmons team will be stuck in mediocrity forever. You don‚Äôt even have to guard him on the perimeter. If you stand closer to him than the free throw line extended, you are a dummy. His lack of shooting or even desire to shoot destroys spacing.   It‚Äôs sad to watch Embiid waste away with Ben at point. The way Embiid plays and the toll his body takes, he really doesn‚Äôt have many great years left. He certainly can‚Äôt wait for Ben to learn the value of offense."
Ben Simmons gonna be ROTY again in China next year lmao.
Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons + Seth Curry
Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons   He‚Äôs really good rn and well liked so you won‚Äôt have to hear slander
Ben Simmons just averaged 9/8/5 in the playoffs hes trash
Idk if I‚Äôd call Ben Simmons a ‚ÄúBright Future‚Äù üòÇ
-says the team who has Ben Simmons.
Ben Simmons is the next LeBron James
3. But not Ben Simmons
He even said his eye test confirms it for him... by watching Gobert vs elite guards... üò¨  .... like... what are we even talking about right now??? Am I in an alternate universe??  It was like having a debate with someone that is trying to argue that Ben Simmons was the best shooter in the league. I was just completely shocked by this take. ü§£ I didn't even know what to say..
"The teams giving 25/year are assuming zo will grow. Tbf zo has consistently shown willingness to improve his game. It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs Ben Simmons. I think that the half court offense stuff can be fixed with coaching and increased reps. Zo‚Äôs role might be different if they play Zion as pg and do 4/5 pnr. You have zo bring up the ball and look for easy transition buckets, and then he gives the ball to Zion to run a pnr. Zion either blows by the help, gets doubled, or lobs to the big. If Zion passes to zo out of the double, zo has the court vision to be able to find the open man or attack a defense that is already broken down. You don‚Äôt have to be as good to attack that kind of D. I think zo can do that."
Ben Simmons
&gt; Then you see Gobert winning it left and right just to be played off the floor when it matters the most  The only DPOY candidate that applies to is Ben Simmons.   Man can't be put in the last minutes of crucial games as his offense is so weak.
"Philly, Joel and Ben Simmons.   Milwaukee, Giannis &amp; Krhis."
Ben Simmons for Hayward.
"I wonder what people consider defensive skill or are they just gonna say, it's cause he is tall, long and athletic that he gets all those blocks, steals and deflections. He was right when he stated that he has the best lateral agility for a guy his size on defense. Even though he does struggle fighting through screens, nobody his size navigates it as well as he does. Maybe except Ben Simmons, but he is a little smaller, not as long and prob weighs 10-15 pounds less. They never give him credit for his timing, anticipation and general awareness on defense."
ben simmons makes like 4 times as much as PJ tucker  PJ tucker 8 million ben simmons 35 million  absolutely zero people would pass up simmons on tucker's contract
You guys had way better Ben Simmons memes than this sub for sure.
I'm surprised nobody is giving Tucker shit. The man is like Ben Simmons 2.1 out there.
&gt;Honestly the league needs to do something about the blatant flopping and complaining  The only thing the league can do about the problem is tell refs not to call those fouls. Unless you are Ben Simmons/Wallace-levels of bad at free throw shooting it will ALWAYS be a better decision to foul-bait.
Ben Simmons just gonna sit there like Helen Keller.
"He‚Äôll be more valuable than a 40+ year old Ben Simmons.  Once Ben will be playing in Shanghai, once he loses his athleticism."
"Damn a ben simmons joke lmfao, did u see that somewhere else or think of it yourself"
"Maybe I'm just old enough to remember when they were stars, especially Hill. But I don't find them hard to tell apart, at all.   To me this is like comparing Devin Booker and Ben Simmons. Or Giannis and Russell Westbrook."
"Honestly, Simmons + Embiid is pretty freaky. Simmons' athleticism, vision, and playmaking combined with Embiid's lowpost game and shooting is pretty nuts. And this player would be 7'.  Embiid is a good interior defender, and Ben is an elite perimeter defender when he wants to be too. This combo is right up there with Khris/Giannis, in my opinion."
"""Ben Simmons playing basketball may have saved 76ers 2nd round exit dream"""
huge if. imagine if ben simmons had a jump shot. see what i mean?
if ben simmons could shoot like curry he would be unstoppable
"it always goes full circle doesn't it... Ben Simmons needs to take some notes, be so bad at free throws that it actually wins you games!"
"I think they‚Äôd make it work, but it‚Äôs still bad for spacing. Embiid needs to be near the basket to be effective, and Tobias Harris is already more of a midrange shooter than a 3 point shooter. Adding DeMar just means that their 3 best players will still be at their best inside of the 3pt line. He can space more than Simmons and can actually drive to the basket and hit free throws so it‚Äôd be a big improvement, but he‚Äôs still not a great fit.   Also they already have Seth Curry who‚Äôs a liability on defense. Swapping Ben for DeMar on defense would be a big step down on that end"
"And Kidd wasn't nearly as bad at shooting as people would have you believe, he just wasn't a scorer and his total FG% was pretty low because he wasn't a ""get to the rim on dunk on someone or hit a trick layup"" guy as much as some other guards. He shot 32.5% on threes for his first ten seasons, compared to the league average of 35.4% (and a higher percent of his shots were threes than the average - 27.3% of his shot attempts vs 18.1% average). Not great, but not like he was Ben Simmons or Michael Carter-Williams or Markelle Fultz or dear god, why can't young Sixers ""guards"" shoot?"
"It's clear that he's also the anti-Ben Simmons on the court, in that he doesn't care about looking foolish on the court.  He knows he's not the best shooter, either from 3 or the line. And he knows there will be times he's going to shoot an airball an just embarrass himself.  I respect him so much that he just doesn't GAF. He's still going to go down low and draw the foul, and he'll still jack up a three every now and then in the hopes that it keeps the defense honest."
"Randle takes a step back next season, as does the team defense as thibodeau's style starts to wear on players.  They miss out on all of their big name targets and Thibodeau is fired in the offseason.   Ben Simmons is traded to Portland for CJ which ends up benefitting neither team.  Philly and Portland both end up in the play in tournament.   The Chicago Bulls end up with Kyle Lowry and the number 2 offense behind the Brooklyn Nets and end up with a top 4 seed in the east.   De'aaron fox makes his first all star appearance beating out Shai for the final spot.   Myles Turner leads the league in blocks, makes his first all star appearance and wins defensive player of the year.   The Phoenix Suns make their second straight NBA Finals appearance.   Kyrie Irving gets red hot in the NBA finals as defensive attention is given primarily to Durant and Harden and Irving walks away with Finals MVP."
Sixers could have made a similar offer as the Nets and included Ben Simmons.
"Danny Green shot 40% from deep on 6 attempts. Lowry shooting a few more isn't radically changing our spacing when Tobias and Ben are still on the team. That's the point, if teams can double off Tobias in the corner, not care about Simmons in the dunker spot while staying tight to Curry and Green, they'll do the same with Lowry.  I don't think the sixers get past the elite teams unless it's a Dame/Harden or maybe a Beal level scorer running PnR with Embiid. You have to open up the floor for Embiid and I think as long as you have Tobias/Ben on the floor with him Lowry isn't fundamentally changing what we struggle with."
"Pretty crazy how many young players are elite passers in the league now.   Trae Young, Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, LaMelo Ball, Ben Simmons, Ja Morant, etc.   Seems like we have been getting a steady influx of players beyond their years for passing/playmaking"
"To be fair, the "".7 to .8"" they were referencing was Ben Simmons. They said Giannis was ""well over 1 point per possession""."
What? He averaged 11 and 6 in 13 games at Duke. I just don‚Äôt know which of his skills will translate to the NBA at a high level. He reminds me of a Ben Simmons type player but not nearly as talented with character concerns. Idk I wouldn‚Äôt take him until the 20s.
"Dame on the Knicks, that would be so amazing, also it would keep other teams from trading for him and making a super team. I dont expect it because Dame will probably stay or get traded for Ben Simmons"
Ricky Rubio on a contender  Ben Simmons in Minny  Indiana moving off one of their bigs  Sacramento trading Harrison Barnes
"People clown around about Ben Simmons being scared to shoot, they talk shit about guys like Kyrie and Harden who loaf on defense to conserve their energy as ball handlers and play makers...  And act appalled that Jrue keeps shooting and trying to make plays after playing full effort on both offense and defense for 40+ minutes."
harden stuttering the open three and then passing the ball away.   pg hitting the backboard. passing to nobody.  ben simmons missing 3 straight after the whistle layups.   russ bricking a layup and missing a dunk.   danny green game winner miss last year. i can‚Äôt remember more
"His defense never disappears, though. That makes his absolute floor a 1st team All-Defense defender, which is never a bad thing. Even when he‚Äôs out there laying bricks all night he‚Äôs still contributing at the same level as say Ben Simmons."
"Player hate. I‚Äôm not Ben Simmons fan obviously bc my flair, but the dude clearly has stuff going on in his life and I want to see him get better. Same goes for Paul George"
Ben Simmons was the 2nd best player on a contender this year. He had a bad playoff but he was very valuable for the sixers to get the one seed.
"I still think there are some adjustments here, but I dont think it's a *terrible* framework.  I've thought of something similar if Portland was going to blow it up and Sixers were going to move Simmons for him:  Philadelphia receives: Dame + TJ Warren + Buddy Hield  Indiana receives: Ben Simmons + Robert Covington  Sacramento receives: Tobias Harris + Domantas Sabonis  Portland receives: Marvin Bagley + Tyrese Maxey + Aaron Holiday + 2021 Sacramento 1st (pick 9) + 2021 Sixers (pick 28) + 2023 Sixers pick + 2027 Sixers pick"
"I'm very confused with this rule.  &amp;#x200B;  So imagine the Kawhi game 7 winner against the sixers. If it was FIBA rules, Ben Simmons could of just grabbed the ball as it was bouncing around the rim?"
wizards ended ben simmons career lmao
Ben Simmons.
"CJ‚Äôs just not a good enough player to improve our chances at a championship. It‚Äôs really as simple as that. What Ben brings (defense, facilitating, rebounding), CJ is poor at, so taking those things away for another scorer who cannot do those other things well to share the backcourt with either Maxey or Curry is not going to make us better.  We were already the number one seed and one of the final 8 teams this year‚Äîwith Simmons being a big part of that. To be contenders, we need a better haul than that for one of our cornerstone players."
"Y'all need to relax. Winning a chip is difficult for anyone. The team did great this year - 1st place in the east gave us a great chance, but it didn't work out. And Simmons is not the only one to blame. All the other players and coaches bear responsibility too. And of course we were affected by injuries like so many teams were this year. Embiid isn't close to being done - this was the 1st year of his prime and he's got at least 4 more years of all-nba level play in him. It's hard for me to imagine creating a better team by trading Ben - the only hope would be for a star player forcing their way out, so Dame is the only player that would make sense as of now. If not, then bringing back our all-star pg gives us the best chance to compete for a championship again. Ben is just about to hit his prime, so there's a high chance he shows improvement the next year"
"Giannis and harden, and maybe rudy gobert/ben simmons are the only times i can think of where they dont go ""hes a great player, etc etc"" whenever another player is brought up by a reporter"
"So the Kings give up De'Aaron Fox, Bagley, and their #9 pick just so they can be the worst team in the league with Ben Simmons?"
 De‚ÄôAaron fox is a more valuable asset than Ben Simmons yet you have a number nine pick and Marvin Bagley in the trade
Ben Simmons isn't on Holiday or Lavine's level.
"&gt; These teams should be lauded for creating the structure to capitalize on it  This is exactly right imo. If you are not a traditional power and/or a desirable market, then you simply cannot expect to have a team full of in-their-prime superstars. That simply doesn't happen for 24-25 teams in the league.  What a ""small"" market team (any team not in the list of 5-6 that can count on a regular influx of superstar talent) *can* do, on the other hand, at least in this era of collaborative superstardom, is commit to being very good for a long enough time that eventually things break right and you can steal one.  That's how Dirk's Mavs did it; that's how the Raptors did it. Those teams hung tough every year, making deep playoff runs, developing world-class chemistry, and ignoring the noise about how they were ""oN a tReAdMiLl"" and would never, indeed *could* never, break through.  Ironically enough, that's exactly how great teams had tended to be built for decades before MJ broke everyone's brains: the GP-Kemp Sonics, the Stockton-Malone Jazz, even the Hakeem-centric Rockets: those teams all lurked around the fringes of contention for an extended period of time. It just so happened that when MJ was healthy, he snuffed them all out. That, combined with Shaq's relatively shocking move to LA and the fluke Spurs season that gave them Tim Duncan, put everyone in the NBA into dynasty-building mode and licensed multi-year tank jobs in the eyes of the public. Front offices could ask their fans: ""How can you expect us to beat the Duncan Spurs or the Kobe-Shaq Lakers without multiple superstars of our own? We *need* to be bad for many years to accumulate the necessary assets, which we will then magically develop into contenders down the line . . . Do not ask us how our young guys will suddenly understand how to win and please do not ask us about why we aren't winning and signing good veteran players in the meantime, either!""  Never mind that there was plenty of evidence that this approach to team-building was cynical at best and a complete farce at worst--evidence in the form of the '04 Pistons, or those tough mid-aughts Pacers teams, or the CWebb Kings, or even the Shaq-Wade Heat--it was easy to sell long-suffering fans in non NY or LA markets on the prospect that a dynasty was always around the corner, on the other end of the tanking rainbow.  Combine that with a wised-up Obama-era basketball fandom that had newly welcomed in thousands of professional-managerial class career strivers from homes in the suburbs, a group of (overwhelmingly) white men who had been trained since childhood to conflate efficiency with absolute moral good and uncritically to accept unlimited asset accumulation as the way of the successful, and you had the perfect storm. This group had cut their fandom teeth on immersive video games that offered the opportunity for bored kids to play God with roster construction and rewarded them for signing players at below-market rates on long-term contracts, exchanging expensive veterans for cheap kids, and accumulating draft picks like free lottery tickets. They could play the games and the Game beyond the game; could be the superstar and the manager in the C-suite that their parents and teachers had prepared them to become.   Of course, a video game can't simulate the toxic effects of perpetual losing and of a lack of locker-room leadership; it can't foresee Kevin Durant and James Harden leaving OKC for their own autonomous reasons any more than it can predict that creating a culture of unlimited entitlement for blue-chip prospects will produce a ""star"" player as fundamentally broken as Ben Simmons.  If the Bucks pull this off, then I'll be all the more delighted that they did so despite their own botched tank job, which produced lottery picks like Brandon Jennings and Joe Alexander and Jabari Parker and ""major"" free-agent signings like Greg Monroe. Despite themselves, the Bucks have built a contender the old-fashioned way: through chemistry and determination, through a culture of winning forged out of years of steady, unheralded improvement, and, most of all, through a heaping portion of luck. Luck gets sneered at around here, and in most of the other self-satisfied neoliberal hell-holes that constitute the majority of social media in this country, but no portion of luck can make a bad team NBA champions. It can make a *good* team into champions, and I think that ought to be enough. Imagine if we had thirty teams trying desperately to be good every year, and holding out hope that, one bright day, everything would break right and their steadfast determination to improve and persevere would finally pay off. I think it'd make for a much better league."
Ben Simmons. Once his rookie era ended it was all over.
"Tier 3 with KAT, Ben Simmons, Jrue Holliday, Zach Lavine, Pascal Siakam, etc.  The all star bench level"
"I mean Dame Beal Lavine and Fox are the only players with even 1% chance of being available who I would take over Ben Simmons to make this team better. Other than those 4 I‚Äôd rather keep Ben, I‚Äôm a Sixers minority I‚Äôm sure.  Appreciate the hope for Dame, and I‚Äôm sorry I hope for your awesome player haha.   In my mind it‚Äôs because I worry he could leave for nothing anyway and Ben is a legit player despite what many think, so it could be mutually beneficial. But if he wants to stay in Chicago right on to that for him and you lol.   And he said he did so you‚Äôre likely in good shape in that regard"
"I agree with them. I'd rather have Green then Ben Simmons coming out. He shot 37% on pretty hard attempts in the G league. He's a Zach Levine level athlete and much better shooter much earlier.   Cade has everything you want in a prospect that doesn't have a massive hype train. Frame, feel. Good enough shooter.   Mobley is dripping with potential. He could be AD or he could be a Chris Bosh type. He's floor is much lower then the other 2."
Ben Simmons for Kyrie straight up makes sense for both teams with a single proviso that kyrie supports the trade.  Nets big 2 will counter Ben's weakness and Ben's strengths improves the nets.  Vice versa  Kyrie gives 76ers exactly what they need a PG who can score in crunch time.  Trade probably won't happen as they are divisional rivals but if it did both teams championship odds would improve
They should trade Kyrie for Ben Simmons and picks tbh
Ben Simmons might have the WOAT ego/mentality.
Magic. He‚Äôd be Ben Simmons now. No @‚Äòs please.
He's a Ben Simmons fan. Improvement is weird.
"Damian ""Ben Simmons"" Lillard"
"&gt;That‚Äôs not what I said, but I guess reading comprehension is difficult.  You're gonna put this on me that I can't make sense of your nonsensical idea? OK üôÑ  How exactly are the Sixers getting far enough under the salary cap to have the roughly $20 million it would take to sign Lowry? Here's what's on their books for next season if they renounce everyone they can:  * Tobias Harris - $36 million  * Ben Simmons - $33 million  * Joel Embiid - $31.58 million  * Seth Curry - $8.2 million  * Matisse Thybulle - $2.84 million  * Tyrese Maxey - $2.6 million  * Shake Milton - $1.85 million  * Isaiah Joe - $1.52 million  * George Hill - $1.3 million  * Roster holds for 3 empty spots - $2.78 million  * 28th pick - 2.02 million  * **Total - $123.69**  The salary cap for next season is estimated to be $112 million. That means the Sixers would need to shed about $31 million in salary to open up $20 million to make Lowry an offer (assuming you can get him for that much). So what is it you're saying, just salary dump Simmons and Curry to the Spurs with no salary at all coming back? Doing so would open about $30 million in cap space. So then how do they get both Lowry and DeRozan?   It's not about reading comprehension, it's just that whatever this idea of yours is, it doesn't make any sense. Please be far more explicit in your explanation if this is making sense to you."
i would consider gambling with ben simmons and try to roll with cp3 and cam payne at the same time but I‚Äôm no genius.
Right now r/nba has an issue with specifically Ben Simmons fans reporting people to Reddit's Toronto-based suicide hotlines.  Shit would get weird if we had our actual contact details on this site.
You were probably a russ hater before he came to the lakers lol I know Ben is bad in the playoffs but watch the regular season he carries us. If we swap Lowry or fox for Simmons this season we are the 4 or 5th seed maybe lower
"He""s four months away from bring traded. I don't believe anything Doc Rivers and Joel Embiid say now, I rather believe their opinion after end of their playoff series is what they think of Ben Simmons"
In what world is Ben Simmons a better pg than Lowry?
Bro you're changing the subject. No one's making you watch Ben Simmons shooting clips.
Zion and then I'm going to throw in ben Simmons. I think he gets 20 a game this year.... Hopefully
"The situation against LA had a lot to do with our injured guards not being unable to rotate on defense, and Quin's inability to adjust.  I don't blame Gobert for not being able to guard 5 people at once.  That's crazy.  Of course I wish he could do more offensively, but his defense is good enough that his shortcomings on offense literally aren't as glaringly apparent and damaging compared to a player like Ben Simmons.  Ben can dribble the ball and create his own shots-- but as we saw in the playoffs, he doesn't even take the shots once he creates them."
"Some big names he missed:  * Russell Westbrook * James Harden (I'm calling him a point guard he's a guard with 4 seasons averaging 10+ assists and is almost always directing play fight me), Steph Curry and Jrue Holiday all in 2009 and the only player he picked was Ricky Rubio at tier 2 * On top of Kyrie 2011 also produced Kemba Walker and Isaiah Thomas * Damian Lillard * Oladipo is listed as a PG for his first season - does that count? * 2016 had Ben Simmons (kind of remarkable that around all the hype he didn't even rate him good enough to be an all-star) * 2017 continues it's oofness by also missing De'Aaron Fox (also Donovan Mitchell but I don't think he was considered a PG at the time)."
"Obviously Ben Simmons could destroy me on the court, but this highlight reel is two 3-pointers and two hand-off assists. This was the best they clips could get from a pickup game?"
LeBron James - he's James  Bradley Beal - he's Beal  Ben Simmons - he's Simmons
r/nba posts video of Simmons lounging around his new mansion.       90% of comments - 'OMG why isn't he practising his shooting!'.         r/nba posts video of Simmons practising his shooting.      90% of comments - 'OMG another pointless video of Ben practising his shooting'
"&gt;That's the one thing I'll never understand with Simmons,   &gt;Instead he refused to shoot them at all, weird.  This is precisely the one thing that seals the deal for me on the Ben Simmons ""case"". Folks here think the defining moment was him passing out of the dunk against Trae Young, but it wasn't.   Nothing else writes the script on Simmons' personality quite as much as the way he had to be coddled and begged MULTIPLE TIMES THROUGH THE MEDIA by his head coach to make a basic adjustment to his game. And instead of acknowledging it he ignored it and waited for Brown to be fired due to the team underperforming from a lack of spacing and Simmons not showing development."
Ben Simmons has actually become criminally underrated by nephews
How is Ben Simmons on this list at all lol
he is talking about the sixers with ben simmons and markelle Fultz
I don‚Äôt hate any player but if I had to do a favourite star player and least favourite‚Ä¶  Favourite: Olympic Patty Mills  Least Favourite: Ben Simmons when he chooses not to play for Australia.
"The Klutch Car Wash has begun. It starts here, then spreads to Twitter before ending up as a topic on The Jump with somebody arguing why the Sixers SHOULD NOT trade Ben Simmons."
&gt; Can someone explain what exactly Lillard does better than CP3 other than volume scoring?  Can someone explain what exactly Lillard does better than Ben Simmons other than volume scoring?   See how bad of an argument that is?
Favorite: ben Simmons rookie year  Least favorite: ben Simmons
Ben Simmons would fit perfectly as well
Ben Simmons can't shoot.  Mark Cuban driving around Dallas.
"Think Paul should be higher tbh maybe even number 2. Also how is Ben Simmons on this list, the 76ers are really struggling to trade him for any value rn"
"Simmons was still on a rookie deal, no way they trade him. Plus the way Simmons plays against LeBron makes me think LeBron is the one guy Ben might actually listen to."
Ben Simmons would never
"Because last yr people were talking about him as ""worst contract in the NBA"" type status and Zach Lowe said the league viewed Al Horford last offseason as a meaningfully less negative deal it was that bad. Now I bet he's more a slight negative to other teams some maybe even a neutral asset.  29 yrs old 6'8 forward neutral defender now mostly, 20 a game on 60% TS someone can talk themselves into it type of guy teams do it with.   Im not a big  Tobias guy, he did escape alot of criticism because of Ben Simmons, but his value is definitely higher now than it was a yr ago"
"if you judged a player off 30 second highlight reels from practice, Ben Simmons would be a better 3 point shooter than Steph and Caruso would be a star player"
Coaches definitely do that if an opposing player hurts other players. Like Pop on Zaza. Doc has thrown his own player (Ben Simmons) under the bus too.
"Yes, can't believe how much disrespect we are getting considering our previous track record, one down season and everybody forgets how consistent we usually are.   The Hawks have one nice Conference Finals run and they're above us? The Sixers are screwed until Ben Simmons is traded and even their fans know it.   Miami is a better playoff team than us, but they aren't really built for the regular season in terms of having depth, I'd expect us to finish above them TBH.   Regular Season Rankings I have:  BKN, MIL, ATL, BOS, MIA, PHI  Playoff Rankings I have:  BKN, MIL, MIA, BOS, ATL, PHI   Those 6 teams are clearly above the rest, nobody else in the East has a Top 20 player."
He‚Äôs much closer to an NBA level jump shot than he would be right handed. He just needs to actually practice his shot and get with a shooting coach.   You can absolutely get worse at shooting than Ben Simmons is right now.
Karl Anthony Jawns after he's traded for Ben Simmons
"Well just looking at PG's drafted from 2005 onwards that made All-Star: Deron Williams, Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Goran Dragic, Steph Curry, Jrue Holiday when he was predominantly a PG, Jeff Teague (hah), John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, Isaiah Thomas, Damian Lillard, not going to count Oladipo as he mostly plays a lot of time at SG and the same will go for LaVine, D'Angelo Russell, Ben Simmons, Luka Doncic and Trae Young.  Gonna have to say you cannot disregard the history made by a lot of these guys. That said, I feel like OP has most likely the best 3 on the list. Curry will go down as the best shooter to exist until someone passes him of course. His 3 championships speak for themselves as he was basically the best player on the court for much of his playoffs. Russell Westbrooks triple double breaking is astounding as are his athletic highlights and the tenacity he exudes. Chris Paul is and will always be remembered as a leader, solid defender for his short size as well as a model of consistency that spread wherever he went regardless of team. His teams always found a way to win.  Honorable mentions are far and few between on this list. Rose and Wall were both insanely good prior to injuries. Kyrie Irving will always be overlooked on his title thanks to LeBron, but personally, I feel like he's always been a top 10 PG every year and in some cases top 5. Thomas had a cool couple of seasons that netted him a scoring title. Lillard has also been amazing but just hasn't found a way to win in playoffs, almost like TMac who put up great numbers but never found playoff success.  But as for who is going to rule the 2020's. That's probably going to go to Doncic and Young. I feel like Fox, LaMelo, Garland and maybe Simmons are going to have amazing contributions as well down the line. I say maybe for Simmons because I just feel like he could probably work better as a starting 4 working at the top of the key, as long as he can develop a jumpshot. This would of course not make him a PG.  And finally, no, LeBron is not up for discussion here."
"This is like watching a video of a lumberjack hitting a tree with an axe very slowly. We're apparently supposed to be enamored due to him actually hitting the tree with the axe, but then we're reminded that he's indeed a lumberjack, and that's what lumberjacks do.   Ben is a lumberjack that gives the axe to someone else to cut the tree (assist), but still gets the credit when the tree falls. He'll show us shitty portrait-oriented, 480p Facebook videos about how he hits trees with an axe in his backyard, but any time we ask him to do it in person, he comes up with every reason as to why he can't.  Ben's a smart guy so he'll make sure the tree won't hit a house once it falls (defense), but do you really want to hire Ben Simmons to cut your tree down? There's a lot of ifs and buts to Ben Simmons' lumber business; sometimes you'd rather not deal with the hassle and hire someone that does the job the way it's meant to be - no frills nor excuses."
"Quoting KOC:   ""Ben Simmons took 95 shots in the playoffs. He tried...  67 shots using his right hand  19 shots using both hands  9 shots using his left hand  In his career, over 70% of his shots are righty.  Simmons in 2016: ""I think I was supposed to be right-handed."""
"Death, Taxes, and videos of Ben Simmons shooting 3‚Äôs in the off-season"
"In a clearly edited practice highlight reel, Ben Simmons hit a total of two jumpers, and both rattled in. Let that sink in."
Yes Steph Curry is a better shooter than Ben Simmons. Deep.
Oh we finally got the Annual Ben simmons Practice 3 pt shooting video.
Give me Dame half court shots. Who the fuck cares about ben simmons shooting threes? he isn't doing it in games so it doesn't really matter.
"Another offseason, more Ben Simmons shooting in practice clips."
Why is Ben Simmons not listed in the rookie of the year race
Udonis Haslem at his best &gt; Ben Simmons
"Physically and play style he is very similar to Lebron. The difference is Lebron is very tough, competitive and a natural leader. Ben Simmons is a depressed, mean spirited teenager that was blessed with ridiculous athleticism."
"Idk, seems like its clearly shitting on Ben Simmons in good faith."
"Why would I need anyone to agree with me?  You think Middleton, a player who takes right around the same amount of shots as Giannis and is tasked with being his teams late game scorer isn‚Äôt close to being the teams first option.  That‚Äôs as stupid as it gets.     You also seem to think Ben Simmons is a second or third option for the 76ers lol."
"I wouldn't say Marcus Smart making All Defense is that outlandish.  I'm gonna go off the rails and list my hot prediction takes for next season.  - 50% chance Westbrook will get traded in a blockbuster at the deadline for a 3P shooter if they're struggling during the regular season.  - The other 50% chance being the Lakers get eliminated in quarter finals again due to a combination of injuries, LeBron getting older and their lack of shooters if Westbrook doesn't get traded.  - The Bulls will make a convincing playoff run and be on the verge of eliminating a contender team in the semis, only to be reverse eliminated due to a heart breaking injury to one of DeRozan or Lavine at the worst timing possible.  - SGA will make All NBA third team.  - Kuzma will change his reputation and breakout as Washington's no 1 option. However, Washington doesn't make the playoffs.  - Klay Thompson will suffer another debilitating injury when he comes back, this time will be career threatening.  - Isaiah Thomas will be signed to a 10 day contract late in the season from a team decimated by injuries and proceed to still do nothing noteworthy.  - Jalen Suggs will emerge as the ROTY. Cade will have played better, but is ineligible due to injuries keeping him out of too many games.  - A package surrounding Ben Simmons will be eventually traded for CJ McCollum midway through the season, despite both front offices vehemently denying they're shopping either of them the entire time up to the trade.  - Donovan Mitchell will request a trade by the end of the season if the Jazz don't make it to the WCF at minimum."
I think there‚Äôs this player named Ben Simmons you may be interested in.
"Jackie Mac has written about Simmons, and on podcasts has talked about his perfectionism/ego holding him back from shooting. She has a soft spot for him and always defends him, which I think holds her back from being realistic about him.  She's told the story multiple times on the Windhorst and Bill Simmons pods about how Ben Simmons shoots 3s really well in practice, but won't shoot them in games b/c he wants to be at least a 38%+ shooter lol.   Same thing applies to driving to the rim and his unwillingness to get fouled and shoot free throws, which is why his FGA always fall precipitously in the playoffs. We all saw how Philly paid for it by being forced to play 4 on 5 on offense vs. the Hawks, and his defense didn't make up for it."
"You're underselling the theatre of it all lol. Its not the take that makes it great. Hell, r/nba has a million Ben Simmons sucks threads. I doubt any of those threads comes close to the absolute disrespect and simultaneous undeserved props that Max's take garnered.  For example, a vanilla version of Max's take would be ""Ben Simmon's is a destitute man's Jrue Holliday/Marcus Smart"". Add a lot more flavor and a couple martian death beams and you would have something resembling Max's take which is why its so great."
DAE Ben Simmons bad
Ben Simmons been getting a lot of hate the last couple months
"People say that, but as a fan, there was a part of me that would rather have Iguodala take the open 3 over the typical Step contested 3 around that time because of how clutch he had been in those moments.  Say what you want, but it is an all-time GOAT hot take because it was so dumb while at the same time having a ring of weird honesty to it. Its not like he's out here saying that he wanted Ben Simmons or Marvin Bagley over Steph, but rather Iguodala who had made clutch shot after clutch shot during a stretch when Steph had gone kind of cold in those moments"
"Udonis for Ben Simmons, straight up."
"i dont care what u say, ben simmons is going to be a superstar"
Talk about beating a dead horse. This is why the sports outlets keep pumping out Ben Simmons rumors...the fans love to hate
Anywhere from Ben Simmons value last year to Ben Simmons value now
"Considering the Ben Simmons saga at the moment, The lucky Kawhi shot that took Toronto to the finals and played against an injured Golden State team, Oh lets not forget ‚ÄúThe process‚Äù, almost killing Zhaire smith at a team lunch, Fultz forgetting to shoot, Losing Jimmy Butler, Trading Mikal Bridges for no reason, Our GM had a burner account criticizing Embid and had to quit, Why must you torture us Philly fans like this?Have we not suffered enough?"
"[""Remember when statmuse used to tweet cool stats and now they just slander Ben Simmons and Rudy Gobert like the rest of NBA Twitter? Sad. Expected more""](https://twitter.com/rudygobert27/status/1409648394805547013)"
Sixers lifer Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons zero career 3pt made
"But it‚Äôs all bens fault we lost the series‚Ä¶  We lost that series because of four things:  1) hawks outplayed us  2) our bench was dreadful  3) ben Simmons‚Äô free throw shooting  4) doc rivers rotations  Ben ended in epic failure with ‚Äúthe pass‚Äù to thybulle, but so much more went into blowing that series than just Simmons."
Ben Simmons but it depends on how my team is built tbh
Also Ben Simmons: https://youtu.be/ls794MhIkU4
"MPJ if my team is bad, Ben Simmons if my team is good."
Probably the only team who'd take Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons averages 15 PPG on 60% TS what are you even talking about.  He had one bad playoff series.
how do i know that? i don't know what ben simmons was thinking i don't the question you're trying to ask. i don't know his state of mind
"Rich Paul: LeBron is interested in signing with Philly  Elton Brand: It's okay, we have our own young LeBron at home  Lebron at home: Ben Simmons"
Ben Simmons would have been flipped for a good third perimeter star and Philly would have won in either 2019 or 2020
PG- Ben Simmons/Steph Curry  SG- Jordan/Kobe  SF- Lebron/KD  PF- Duncan/Giannis  C- Embiid/Jokic
"Kobe had all the skills but he didn't want to use all of them, particularly not passing the ball and especially not passing the ball in the Finals. And if there's some option you can't or won't take, as Ben Simmons has demonstrated this year, a great defense will punish you for it."
Thanks. You made me inadvertantly watch Ben Simmons in a Sixers uniform again.  I made declarations people!
"Mate, you're basically describing Ben Simmons, so you know how valuable he is."

Leave future Timberwolves star Ben Simmons alone.
Ahhh it feels good to find new ways to shit on Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons
"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs probable anymore. The top 15 or so are all from back in the day with probably suspect assist numbers. Rajon Rondo only got 25 assist and he was the OG Ben Simmons  The way basketball is played now I don‚Äôt think allows this stat to really be contested. Russ might be the closest as I think he had 24 this year, but now he‚Äôs going to a team with LeBron and AD, so is he really gonna have the ball that much?"
"You people aren't bored of this yet? ""This 36749261924th post about why Ben Simmons is the worst player in the world is really valuable stuff!"""
"Ben Simmons. Has the all the tools to be a top player in the league, but can‚Äôt put it together for some reason. Idk why I‚Äôm still holding out hope, it would be a shame to see that much potential go to waste"
Ben Simmons might not be a guard for much longer too
Ben Simmons has 199 in four season with two season where he played less than 60 games
"A 10/10/10 guys is basically Ben Simmons. I personally love Ben Simmons. But that 10/10/10 comes with true un-selfishness (maybe too much tbh) DPOY defense, and at 6'11... I know Ben Simmons has been getting a lot of hate here recently, but I think he's worth every penny."
I‚Äôm going to repost this with ‚ÄúI can watch all of Ben Simmons‚Äô Game 7 highlights vs the Hawks in the time it takes Giannis to shoot a free throw‚Äù
so basically westbrook with the ben simmons shot selection or jokic with drummonds post game
honestly surprised nobody has put ben simmons on this
Which part was the troll? Which part was untrue? You salty that your poverty franchise employs Ben Simmons? Celtics own the Flopadelphia Sixers and Marcus Smart would be the second best player on your team
"Yes Ben Simmons was good at defense but if you don‚Äôt score and you‚Äôre the second best player and you usually do, that‚Äôs a significant problem and factor when you think about how impressive the Hawks winning was."
"Bro Ben didn‚Äôt score because he didn‚Äôt shoot, not because he missed them! He‚Äôll I hate to say it but Trae had a bad game 7 against them. Simmons even gave up a free dunk that might‚Äôve won the game!"
"So Ben Simmons, their second best player becoming a liability doesn‚Äôt mean anything to you? Come on man."
Lol no one in their right mind would trade edwards for ben fucking simmons especially after this year.. unless you give them package of ben harris and multiple picks or something
"It might, but I strongly doubt it.  Players making sudden jumps of improvement usually happen for 1 of 3 reasons: 1) they needed time to adjust to the NBA, and experience and basketball IQ needed to come with time, 2) they needed to improve their physique, and as they rounded into their physical prime they were able to dominate in ways that they couldn‚Äôt before, or 3) they added new skills that they didn‚Äôt have before.    Ben Simmons doesn‚Äôt fit into any of those 3 categories.  He was already NBA ready both physically and in terms of his basketball IQ.  And despite how it may seem, his shooting woes aren‚Äôt because he needs to learn a new skill.  Ben Simmons knows how to shoot.  His form isn‚Äôt horrendous, and there‚Äôs no weird hitch in it.  The basics are there, he has all the tools to be a .300 shooter.  His issue isn‚Äôt that he has to learn the mechanics of jump shooting.    Likely, his issues with shooting are in large part mental.  Dude very well might have a psychological hangup about shooting, and that‚Äôs a lot harder to overcome even if we give him a few years."
"All this Ben Simmons trade talk is wildly overvaluing him. His stock is probably at around the lowest it has been in a couple years on account of his playoff performance. I‚Äôm guessing they trade him for like Buddy Hield and a couple 1st‚Äôs or trade him plus all the picks until the end of the universe for Beal or Dame if either of them want out. Either way I think the package is going to reveal that everyone with real NBA jobs, including Morey, doesn‚Äôt value him as highly as reporters and fans do."
Ben Simmons in shambles
Ben Simmons : 3 point leader
Ben Simmons?
"I need the Pistons to win so badly tonight. I hate the fucking Sixers. In fact they're my least favorite team in the NBA right now and it's not even close. Fuck Embiid and his trashtalking ass. Shut the fuck Up and go accomplish something first. Fuck the Process. Fuck Sam Hinkie. It's not adorable to be utter shit for several years by choice. It's pathetic. Most of all FUCK THE MEDIA for all the attention they spend on these loosers despite them not even trying to win fucking games. Fuck the Media for celebrating every tweet of Joel ""69% conditioning"" Embiid. I was so happy when I saw Jalen Rose told that punk to shut his mouth and act like a professional. But most of all Fuck them for crowning their asses before they've done anything. At this point ""RoCo"" (what a stupid nickname) is the wet dream of half the NBA writers across the League. Ben Simmons is LeBron 2.0 and Embiid is basically Shaq with a 3 point shot. Fuck the Sixers, Fuck Embiid, Fuck Sam Hinkie, Fuck the Process. Also FTP."
"Oh wow. I honestly did not realize his injury was that bad.   I knew it was bad, obviously, but this is not a good sign for GS.  Even more of an incentive for GS to trade some of those youngsters for proven vets. I am NOT saying make a ""steaming pile of rotten shit"" deal like trading their assets for Ben Simmons. But, a deal that helps the team with ""win-now"" players? Absolutely."
It‚Äôs a tough call because Ben Simmons is a top 15 player in the regular season. 15/8/8 and runner up for DPOTY is nothing to scoff at. Obviously the playoffs are a different story. Still think he‚Äôd be incredibly valuable to a team like the Kings or Timberwolves just trying to make it to the playoffs
"Ben Simmons clearly has an issue with perfectionism and needs to see a therapist.   I find his aloof personality to be a cover for his fear of taking shots, and them not going in."
"Lmao there's a deleted comment in the 4 about Ben being unlikeable and people saying Simmons hasn't Dona anything to be unlikeable, he barely talks. Glad Ben cleared that one up for us."
"If everyone related to the Sixers who are fed up with Ben Simmons should retire, they're going to run out of both a front office and players."
Jeez if we engage in a Ben Simmons/Beal trade I‚Äôm hoping the Sixers take this bum as well and send back Seth
Ben Simmons gets by by being a big sexy hunk of a man
Ben Simmons‚Äô ball returner at home
"Lol the fact that Jazz Fans think Ben Simmons is your biggest rivals says enough about your back water, dumpster fire, embarrassment of a franchise.    Oh yea thanks for reminding me, your best ever player is a pedophile. Have fun with that."
"Ben simmons is 100% percent better, but his value is lower than what he gives u. He's still better than wiggins tho that's why I'm saying a 3 way deal, so the 76ers will get another role player from a different team"
"What annoys me about this entire saga is that I‚Äôm actually sympathetic/supportive of Simmons, and I normally never pass up an opportunity to hate on dude.  The Sixers didn‚Äôt just fail to protect him from backlash, the mfers threw him under the bus.  It‚Äôs not that Ben hasn‚Äôt earned the reckoning coming him way, but it seems pretty clear to the me Philly‚Äôs FO fucked up bad in tanking his trade value over off season by taking part in their own way.  Now they‚Äôre surprised he isn‚Äôt having none of their shit and is refusing to play for them?  Shocker.  I‚Äôm honestly impressed with Simmons"
"It's not just Doc or the Sixers or Embiid.  If Jimmy Butler had a falling out after the series and forced a trade there would be contenders lined up and Miami would get an all star level player and/or a shit ton of picks.  There's not a single contender in the Simmons sweepstakes and no all star level player on the table. The league offices know Ben isn't on Jimmy's level, even though people are trying to sell it like he is.  Ben could be, but he hasn't put in the work yet. And him not putting in the work is exactly why his trade value is in the toilet. Not Doc. Not the Sixers. Not ""the pass"" ... His demonstrated lack of effort to develop and improve obvious glaring deficiencies in his game to a championship level is what's destroyed his trade value.  TL;DR  The difference between Ben &amp; Jimmy is everyone knows Jimmy puts in the work. Everyone knows Ben doesn't (unless he's done something totally out of character this summer)"
Is that Ben Simmons music‚Ä¶
Ben Simmons cheating his way through a tournament and winning a title by the end of the show might cause a riot in Philly.    I‚Äôd love to see it.
Ben Simmons is just a marshmallow.  Can‚Äôt wait to see him play in philly again on a different team
"Even if that is true, the first time to do so isn't in a post game interview and answering the question the way Doc did isn't holding anyone accountable.  I don't get why this is becoming a Ben vs Doc/Sixers things for some of you. I don't think anyone is in disagreement that Simmons didn't screw up. The point is that the Sixers and/or Doc mismanaged the whole thing as well"
1. AI  2. Mo Cheeks  3. Ben Simmons
"Right now, probably Giannis and Russ.. or whatever the opposite of Ben Simmons is"
Ben Simmons has never been held accountable ever. There is (was) always an excuse.
"Simmons does it to himself. He skipped out on the Aussie team to hang out with his newest chick at Wimbledon. He‚Äôs more interested in looking good on social media than improving. And he‚Äôs fearful of failure. The best thing for Ben would be to go to a lottery team and take control surrounded by shooters. If he can prove himself for a year or two in that situation, his stocks will be go up"
"The Sixers had 20 point leads in multiple games at home. One guy not shooting doesn't make you blow multiple 20 point leads at home.   If Doc had run better lineups and/or if Embiid wasn't gassed by every 4th quarter, the 6ers could easily have won the series.   Boiling the series down to Ben Simmons' lack of aggression is ridiculously overly reductive."
"Oh for sure, I agree that the circlejerk on Ben is wild rn  You had people say that no team would ever be interested in Ben after the playoffs, and he was destined for a career in China   It is what it is, Doc somehow didn‚Äôt get as much criticism as I think he deserved (especially over the Simmons comments)  Eventually it‚Äôll pass over, same thing happens with PG"
"My biggest criticism about Ben Simmons is that his deficiency as a basketball player has been known ever since his rookie season yet nothing has been done on his end to address that issue. Like Ben Simmons and his trainers can claim the amount of practice he‚Äôs done, it doesn‚Äôt matter in the end as long as he doesn‚Äôt show it in a nba game. In fact, I find it hard to pinpoint what exactly Simmons has improved upon on offense since his rookie season."
"&gt; Butler not being able to shoot was a problem.  Just about this point. But Butler is willing and able to shoot tho. (at times he probably shouldnt). While Ben just straight up wont.  On the second point, yea you def right. Simmons is still a solid player cause of defense/playmake but his shooting problems is too big of a problem relative to that."
"Embid on Simmons: ""I don't have the ability to snap, to completely lose my mind. So you are wrong, we are nothing like what people would guess. I think the competitive fire inside us is actually very dissimilar...It's something I look at, everyday I'm thankful to go to war with Ben Simmons.""   Tried cooking some pasta but I'm just an amateur chef."
"No, it's not just Ben Simmons who recognizes that Doc's answers were terrible -- it was the vast majority of people paying attention.  Saying my entire argument hinges on that is just wildly wrong.  Again, you are in the minority to the extreme of people who think Doc's post game interview was somehow an endorsement of Simmons.  It wasn't, he threw him under the bus"
"Big 3 of the most hated players in the NBA as of this moment. Andrew Wiggins, Ben Simmons, and now Kyrie Irving."
"The Sixers lost cause of other reasons too, but Ben sucked that series  10 points on 53% TS while not spacing the floor at all is rough and Ben was a liability when he was fouled   33% is awful  It also doesn‚Äôt help that he only made like 3 FG‚Äôs in the entire series  Like I said, the Sixers loss wasn‚Äôt entirely on him but Simmons does deserve criticism on his lack of shooting skills   He hasn‚Äôt shown to overcome that skill yet"
That implies Ben Simmons takes shots.
"&gt; there isn't even anything to spin here, it's blatantly obvious what he is saying  Right, which is why Ben Simmons is completely on board with what Doc said.  You are the one in the minority with your interpretation, dude.  Everyone else realizes this is a clear case of a coach not having his players back and it rightfully pissed Simmons off."
"Ben Simmons going from 14ppg to 10ppg is not why the 6ers lost the series. Seth Curry having one of the most insane shooting series ever more than made up for Ben's scoring downtick.   Dumping on Simmons is just people avoiding the fact that Doc's lineup management was ass and that Embiid was ass in the 2nd half of most games and turned the ball over a ton.   Simmons didn't get exposed by himself, the 6ers were exposed as a team. People just want the easiest narrative and it wouldn't do to have the blame shared."
"I want Ben Simmons to be booed out of the building in Philly. Knowing Sixer fans, they would probably start a riot lol"
lol what a fantastic way of saying he thinks Ben Simmons is a moron. I love this.
I dont have proof since I just made my account but I correctly predicted that Ben Simmons would fail miserably and see his stock drop significantly  I also predicted the Hawks to get swept by the Knicks tho.....
"Steven Adam's has a incredible season shooting 47% from 3 on 7 attempts per game, leading the pelicans to the finals along side zion and Ben Simmons after a blockbuster 7 team trade. They then lose in game 7 vs against the Raptors lead by Isaiah Thomas, MVP fred vanvleet, and FMVP Goran Dragic. Lebron retires, Ben Simmons retires, and Richard Jefferson comes out of retirement"
Ben Simmons
"This isn't about defending a player. This is about understanding situations and expectations. Ben was absolutely balling until the All Star break and was shooting a career high 67 from FT. Post ASB, his level of play took a dive even though he was still putting up decent numbers. If you watched the Sixers through the season, you could tell the difference. His ft also shot down to 55 post ASB and kept plummetting as he went into the playoffs. Reasonable fans who followed the team closely would've seen this dip in performance and would've expected his offensive struggles. Ever consider that maybe he didn't attempt a lot of shots or the open dunk because he wasn't sure he would score or knock down the FTs? Maybe he decided it would be better for the team if someone else took on the scoring load if he wasn't confident in himself. His scoring struggles aside, he still defended at an elite level and was setting up teammates throughout the series.   Tobi gets paid the same amount to literally score. He wasn't a positive on defense and neither was he a playmaker. All he had to do was score, something he's actually good at. Instead he kept missing makeable shots at crucial points in the series.   Reasonable fans would expect Simmons to play defense, set up teammates and score as the 3rd or 4th option. That's based on his role this season and how he was used. And they would expect Tobi to be the 2nd option on scoring.   So don't pretend to be reasonable, just shit on Ben like the rest and be done with it."
"There's stark difference between not attempting a single shot in the offense and limiting shots in the offense to prioritize defense. I mean, you do understand that right? Heck even Andre Roberson will try in the offense. Give Ben Wallace an open lane and he will dunk that mf.   But hey, if we're talking about his mental health, then in behalf of everyone, I apologize. We are all in the wrong here for not giving due concern for Ben Simmons who apparently requires heavier consideration.   Anyway, wait, how the hell are you squandering Tobi when it is also possible that his failure in offense is also a mental struggle? Can you at least decide on one narrative so that you can effectively defend Ben?"
ben simmons
Well yeah Giannis is the anti-Simmons. But at this point comparing them doesn't help anyone. Ben will be Ben.
Ben Simmons talk is so boring now honestly. The story hasn‚Äôt changed in months and won‚Äôt change for like 2 months
"What? Doc wouldn't just come out and say fuck Simmons... Trading his ass this summer.   He is the coach of that player... Blame lies on him too... He has to say something like we have work to do. And bla bla...   Saying point blank that Ben is not a championship point guard and mentioning him freezing up and free throws clearly means he is putting blame on him. In polite coach words, he basically said that Simmons fcuking sucked."
"Stood by him?  From your own post:  &gt; Reporter: Doc, do you think Ben Simmons can still be a point guard for a championship team like the one you guys want to become?  &gt; Doc: yeah David, I don't know that question, or the answer to that right now, um, so I don't know the answer to that."
"I, for one, am enjoying the current state of the Ben Simmons debacle."
Ben Simmons deserved it regardless.
And it's still not even the most famous passing on a shot this year.   That honour still belongs to Ben Simmons.
Ben Simmons and shot selection.
1. Ben Simmons fires Rich Paul by December 2. Klutch Sports put on some sort of probation by the league office 3. Two or more teams have draft picks stripped for tampering 4. Kyrie Irving retires
I guess Ben Simmons isn't the only player that doesn't like taking shots.
Ben Simmons is a star. Matisse Thybulle is a young role player. The weight of their mistakes is different.
"There‚Äôs a reason a guy like Ben Simmons got crucified and got demoted in everybody‚Äôs rankings. Dude can do everything but score effectively. At this point, people be taking the likes of Fox and Ja over Ben so I think this is a good representation that scoring is the most important thing and forever will be.   Also, that‚Äôs why the likes of Melo, TMac, are heavily praised while TA, Ben Wallace, etc don‚Äôt get any mentions in the all-time great discussions."
*Danny Green taking a selfie in front of a depressed Ben Simmons*  You know I had to do it one time lol
"I'm referring to final minutes, not final possession in a one-possession game. Ben Simmons is a detriment to your team in crunch time because not only can he only hit ~30% of his free throws, he's also afraid to attempt a basket because of how scared he is of taking those free throws that he will likely miss. That makes it so that you are playing 4v5 on offense and no playoff team can afford to do that."
I think its Ben Simmons everyone likes him
D'Lo is the biggest example of empty calories in the league to me. Can't believe Wolves fans wouldn't include him in a deal for Ben Simmons...
"I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd agree. In fact, with how unique of a defender Ben Simmons is, If he weren‚Äôt already a started, I could even see teams bringing him in off the bench at the end of a game to guard the other teams biggest scoring threat. Similar to how trae young is sometimes subbed out for some end game possessions when the hawks need to preserve a lead"
"Fantastic points. And I agree, Giannis is the standard bearer for actually being elite in everything other than shooting. Though, I would argue that my including ""mental toughness"" as a weakness does highlight a key difference.  However, the reality is that me phoning in ""mental toughness"" as a single trait, is an umbrella for a whole host of deficiencies.  I'm just too used to having to start a discussion by hedging so far in his favor against the typical ""fuck Ben"" crowd, when in reality it's actually me posturing at least a touch above what I actually think he is or is capable of.  Absolutely right, he SHOULD have astronomically more value. But, every trade has two sides and he's such a target asset they need to get rid of.  I agree that the line between exceptional vision/passing and playmaker is very, very debatable. However, I do think his greatness shows up more in transition and less, with Philly, in the half-court (any team with a dom big). For me, the bigger question is can a team, in the modern league, with enough perimeter/mid threat, support a diving pg.  I kind of doubt it, because we run into the same issues of just not getting enough points on the board, same as a dom big. But, I *can* see it working in theory with a killer perimeter game, **if** they just focus on him getting his confidence from the line rather than his overall shot.   Whether or not that is actually Simmons, vs someone else, or Simmons is just too mentally weak or frankly doesn't give enough shits to be great, I dunno.  Good chat, thanks for checking me a bit more on coming over the top pro Simmons by just being reasonable. I think he's over-criticized, but certainly not by the amount I lay out there when I expect to get into these discussions.  Cheers."
Ben Simmons. Ben Simmons is always the answer. Regardless of fanbase. Always Ben Simmons. Jk.   Probably DeAndre Jordan will catch some heat considering he sucked so hard for the Nets last season. Basically Andre Drummond 2.0
"Can't argue with any of that. Well except being elite in everything except shooting. We know what elite in everything except shooting looks like in Giannis. Simmons is not great at finishing around the rim or getting to the basket at half court. And contrary to everyone else's opinion, I don't think he's a great playmaker. He's a good passer with great court vision and he makes good plays on the break. But playmaking to me, is well, making plays. When your team is having a hard time generating an offense, an elite playmaker will find a way. Like Luka or Trae does.  But I digress, I don't mean to come off too much like a simmons hater. We already have too many of those lol. I agree pretty much that this is more on the whole org than on simmons. I actually understand that simmons believes he's the player that he is and shouldn't be convinced to be another type of player. The team should have traded him before last year, or have completely built around their stars accordingly. I mean come on, trading for tobi and drafting thybulle?  Anyway, slight tangent. Since you mentioned it, i really hated those comments from philly fans that there is no way they would trade Ben for CJ. Sure Simmons SHOULD have more value, but his current stock is through the floor, and selling under market price to get a player like CJ is a good deal. Same for Brogdon. They use Jrue Holiday getting so much in exchange as comparison even though I would argue that Jrue is the better player. The only reason any team would pick simmons over jrue is potential, and we already know how much value Ben's potential really holds lol."
"Lol Murray is a younger, better player who fits better with a star big man and doesn‚Äôt have complete mental boom. Ben Simmons has an untenable ego and absolutely no work ethic, I am very glad he will never be a Piston."
"Yeah this always blows my mind, how can GMs let a whole deal fall apart because of 1 or 2 firsts when it comes to a player like Harden lol. Look at what the lakers gave up for AD, look at what the clippers gave up for PG (who‚Äôs way inferior compared to Harden), but Morey thinks he‚Äôs gonna outsmart every GM and hes now left holding the bag- a ben simmons lol"
"If you honestly think Ben Simmons and Andrew Wiggins have the same value, stop watching basketball."
"So what if Simmons was responsible for the loss? The team shouldn't throw him under the bus and scapegoat him. Remember in 2013-16 when Lowry and Demar were the Trash Bros? Players have bad playoff performances, it happens. It doesn't mean that they can't be cornerstones. If we threw Lowry or Demar under the bus after getting swept by the Wizards, we don't have a Championship.  No player should be solely responsible for a playoff loss. It's a loss for the team and franchise as a whole. Pinning all this on Ben is just taking the easy route and dealing with the symptoms not the cause."
"When you look at it as an isolated incident, then you‚Äôd have a chance of being right.  But the passed dunk was just the straw that broke the camels back.  Ben shot 7 field goals in the fourth quarter during that series as at his lowest their third option.  Not to mention several games through the playoffs were almost lost because defenses can literally exploit him like Shaq, except Shaq actually shot 50% from FT and Ben was more like 35%.  Then there‚Äôs his tendency to play highlight defense rather than actual defense, as in he goes for chasedowns and loose balls but also looks like he‚Äôs barely paying attention half of the time.  You‚Äôre also completely disregarding the fact that Embiid had to take on a somewhat large level of ball handling duties because their primary ball handler was getting hacked to shit and missing all of his freethrows.  And that the game was an abberation for Embiid, rather than the complete norm for Simmons.  If Embiid played like that every night, he‚Äôd be getting booed too, but he doesn‚Äôt because he actually cares about basketball on a level other than collecting checks and DMing instagram models."
"I'm ""devil's advocate"" pro-Simmons. I think there is a side to the story that is way less his ""fault"" and more him shouldering the blame for others. That said, he has plenty of blame.  I don't think that it's as simple as a single string from Doc Rivers' comment directly to Simmons posturing pre-camp. But, that was a professional mistake that Doc made and in doing so, he provided cover for others to do so, while also making it harder to eventually walk back (as they've tried to do).  I think his fit in Philly has been shit from the start. Why did they go out and get a guy that had shown zero ability to shoot outside the paint (check out his LSU shot chart) when they knew they were building around Embiid? Because they wanted to have their cake and eat it too. It's so easy to shit on Ben now for not having developed the shot that he never had, but they went and got him because in order to truly build a team around a dominate big in today's league, you have to have gobsmacking defense and control the pace/score.  But, they fucked up with Butler/JJ, could not get the value/Harden they wanted, so resigned him to the max and shifted blame to the fact that he (still) could not shoot.  Rather than the fact that Embiid is flaky AF as a ""leader"", just depends on how he is feeling that day. Rivers is... Well, Rivers. And that the admin had already doubled down on this liable asset, rather than properly fill out the roster.  I'm not saying he's soft, hard, chubbed, or that I would want him on my team. I'm a blazer fan and the fact that the conversation has finally moved from the ludicrous Ben &lt;-&gt; Dame, to ""would Dame even want Ben for CJ?"" is late, but completely on point.  But, the dude has shown absolute elite level skills in basically all but two areas. Shooting, and ultimately mental toughness. Those are not dismissible, far from it, *but* the narrowing focus on the former has certainly contributed to the latter. They need him to shoot, because they have Embiid as their #1. But, then they bitch about him not being able to do the thing he's never done, as though they had no choice in drafting/re-signing him.  I'm sure he is embarrassed of his performance, as he should be. But, also sure that his fit in Philly has been very poor from the start. People talk about him wasting Embiid's prime? What about them wasting his formidable years? They act like contracts just fall out of the sky, they had every chance to let him go and should have. They fucked up, even after very publicly pushing to get Harden for him and he stayed true, and now everybody has a bone to pick with his professionalism once he restates the thing that Doc/Embiid/fans/media were fine saying immediately after the playoffs.  He should report to camp/preseason and just Harden it in. I. mean, all he would have to do is play down to the fans'/media stated expectations of him. Take every terrible shot.  Again, devil's advocate grain of salt. But, it's nonsense how one sided this has ended up."
"Lmao, why is he on msnbc talking about this? The Trump line was probably written by msnbc. 95% of their viewers probably have zero clue who Ben Simmons is but get that Trump joke in there!"
"Ben Simmons, 6'11 starting point guard for the Philadelphia 76ers from Melbourne, Australia, said three years ago that he would eventually start hitting three point field goal attempts at a greater rate. Evidence has shown he was incorrect."
"Nah, at the end of the day you have to be able to be played to be a problem. In the final minutes you can't play Ben Simmons so you can't rely on him to handle Luka."
Lakers to Ben Simmons. Have to trade Lebron to create the cap room.
You hate Ben Simmons but not Jordan. Are you 7 years old?
"Ben simmons dropped his value alot, i can see it working with a 3 way deal perhaps"
Replace Ben Simmons with Lowry or FVV and the sixers win that series 4-2 or 4-1.
"Oh, I totally get you man. It was in no way a good answer for a coach. He could have answered in 10 different ways that would have been better. I even understand why it would upset simmons. Just not to the level of not showing up to practice.   Not like he was verbally abused or thrashed in public. It wasn't even a criticism, just a lack of praise. Doesn't even mean that he can't be on a starting lineup of a championship team. It's a type of statement that could be talked through in a team meeting you know? Hash it out and what not.   Though in total fairness to ben simmons, I don't think he's leaving because of a non praise in a post game comment. I don't think he's THAT soft (I mean... right??...lol). At the risk of delving into armchair psychology, I think he's just embrassed of his own performance. He probably feels that the series is gonna follow him around for the rest of his career in philly and it would take a monumental playoff performance to erase. But it's easier to just leave and start fresh. Only to a california team though!"
"Whats Doc Rivers point here? While people hate on Simmons rightfully so, Ben does have a point of not wanting to be back at Philly. He was thrown under the bus by this same coach...   Supporters of Trump who believe he won has zero point, while Ben does.  Doc Rivers point?"
Ben Simmons wants to know yo location
There‚Äôs a chance Sixers fans would rather have ben Simmons than Wiggins lmfao
"Warriors GM just got fined for publicly slandering Ben Simmons lol, and now Wiggins is both overpaid and unvaxed. People really overestimate his value."
"Ben Simmons, Players that do not wanna get vaccinated, Rosas fired out of nowhere (now prolly the reason), Rich Paul case... what a crazy strange offseason lmao"
Something to break up the whole Ben Simmons thing
Ben Simmons voted for Trump.
Joel Embiid will lead the Sixers to the NBA finals with or without Ben Simmons on the roster
"The best possible outcome of this is that Ben Simmons plays in the first home game of the season, makes like five threes in the first quarter, gives double middle fingers to all the staff and crowd, and then walks off the court."
What the hell kind of question is that to ask somebody who's currently on the team? What is Thybulle suppose to say here? Blame his employer or Ben Simmons?
Found ben simmons or his agent here
Please explain to me how anyone other than Ben Simmons was responsible for passing up the open dunk that Embiid claims was the turning point of the loss.   I know what ‚Äúwe‚Äù means literally but I also can read in between the lines a little bit.
"Doc rivers might be one of the worst coach/manager in the league in the past ten years, going from choke to choke with quality teams and blaming others for his own failures. I don't know how he keep so much credit in the league and why the sixers signed him so quickly last year. You can blame ben simmons for last year playoffs but doc rivers attitude on the bench was rather terrible"
"""I would've shown up to training camp, but Doc Rivers called me a Trump supporter.""  -Ben Simmons in a week"
"I always wondered if Clippers up and dipped to Anaheim if the would be accepted but they just have too much stink on them.   San Diego is not going to want them either. And Nor Cal already has the Warriors and the sorry ass Kings. No offense to the kings it‚Äôs just that, that ownership team is hot garbage on a June weekend.  The Clippers are here to stay. Not because LA loves them but because they are the Ben Simmons of basketball franchises. Yeah they‚Äôre alright but you don‚Äôt want that in your town."
"I 100% agree with everything you said, ***except*** the ‚Äútiny bit‚Äù part.  Doc, Embiid, Thybulle(as he points out here), and basically anyone on the team not named Seth Curry have not gotten the criticism they deserve for this, and, in the case if Doc and the front office, they haven‚Äôt even gotten close to the criticism they deserve. Ben Simmons has certainly been thrown under the bus. Almost no one talks about anyone but Ben.  And, no, the occasional upvoted comment on n this sub does not count as an equalizing level of criticism."
They should trade him straight up for Ben Simmons
Dark-skinned? Ben Simmons? Lmao
1. Ben Simmons 2. Rockets 3. Nuggets?
Happened to Jrue Holiday too. He came back with more tape study a bit better prepared.  I think the best defender on Luka is still Ben Simmons though. He's athletic and big enough to just bother the shit outta him. It'd be INTERESTING to see them in the same conference
"I know people like to pinpoint on that one play over Trae Young and it gets overstated, but it was not an exaggeration to say Ben Simmons had an awful performance for the series and lacked aggressiveness. Simmons took the 11th most FGA of both teams that series. He belittled himself to role player status and took less than 5 shots in 3 of those games. Forgot unwilling to shoot in the clutch, he was barely shooting all game. His series was defined by way more than just that one play."
"Ben Simmons fucking up the Sixers shit in the playoffs be like ""You know I had to do it one time [lol #Holocaust""](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/10/09/1412835063858_wps_2_image001_png_danny_green.jpg)  The lol followed up by hashtag Holocaust was beyond egregious. Danny Green is a wild boy üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
Sure the Sixers could've handled it better from an outside perspective.  However Ben Simmons could've also done a whole lot better.  How you a max level player but you actively run away in the 4th.  There's no way to spin Simmons as on the side that should be sympathized with when he goes like an entire series' worth of 4th quarters without scoring.
Ben Simmons
"Why do people crucify Ben for not being a good offensive player but will forgive someone for being a terrible defender even when it loses them games?   Ben was a net positive all series and played elite defense. It‚Äôs been known now for three years he can‚Äôt score in the playoffs or run point. The sixers have had amble opportunities to trade him. They could have easily kept Butler, traded Simmons and replaced Brett brown in 2019 off season and came out as winners of the East in 2020 instead of the heat. Instead we just pile on a single player for a known weakness of his when the entire team and front office has shit the bed in back to back years"
Ben Simmons has a case for me
"&gt;it sounds like Rivers is saying this about Sixers staff who think there's any hope of Ben coming back  I don't think this is it, but the analogy makes way more sense if applied to the '6ers FO.  Ben more than anything feels really uncomfortable with continuing to play for the team and is willing to sacrifice his professional prospects to a certain degree to do it (fines, future contract negotiation leverage).    On the organization's end, demanding asinine returns from other teams and threatening to fine Simmons while thinking they can convince him to return is stupid on multiple fronts:  (1) Simmons isn't so good that getting good value for him is almost impossible, like the previous Harden situation; (2) this is hurting the organization's attraction to future stars; (3) the team is in win-now mode with a true superstar whose goodwill they will quite likely damage; and (4) considering how bad of a fit Simmons' personality is for the city and its fans, even Simmons' intangibles suggest he should be traded.    While Simmons could be described as being really pouty about the situation, the '6ers FO is being overtly delusional.  Also to u/JustaTurdOutThere, u/FatalFirecrotch, u/DramDemon"
"Nah, it was a major fuck up. Not as a human being, but as a coach. As a human being, totally understandable given the frustration, etc...  But, his job as a coach is to not be an individual, and act in the best interest of the team. Between the time that the game was over and when he sat in front of those mics, he needed to get his mind right and shift to ""maximize Ben's value/minimize the value loss"". Diffuse the idea/reality that Ben was a major factor in their exit.  Other than Simmons himself, that moment probably contributed the most to Simmons tanking value. Nobody is going to pay on the dollar for an asset they **know** you don't want."
It was Ben Simmons but now that the problem solved itself it's Westbrook.

We'll trade him in the summer. I wish philly could use him because I would definitely take Ben Simmons for him right now

"ben simmons shoot bad, upvotes to the left"
Porzingis for Ben Simmons!!
I am all Ben Simmons on this blessed day.
It kinda cracks me up hearing Jay Williams talk about Kyrie and Ben Simmons though.   üëÄ
Ben simmons. He's 25. Doesn't like Philly. Has a lot of friends in this league and any star would team up with someone that can guard your man and doesn't care about scoring first.
Tatum and Ben Simmons going to team up to share rookie of the year honors
Yall got your guy! Ben Simmons but averages 2 assists instead of 8. Stud!
Russilo is the most annoying media personality that isn‚Äôt on one of those awful ESPN shows. Dude is just bootleg Ben Simmons but without any of the charm or good takes.
"If I had LeBron James and the 2012 NBA all stars, I would think to myself, ""I need to surround LeBron with veteran shooters who can be productive off ball and have a proven track record of exceling under the pressures of the playoffs.""  Now does that sound like the profile of Ben Simmons?"
Ben Simmons is the George Clooney Batman with the nipples.
Nets if you think Harden will continue to play like Ben Simmons without the defense  Lakers if you think he won't lol
"ben simmons?  his offense was, I guess, a bit better than mobley's is at the moment but it wouldn't be hard for him to get better than simmons on that front, imo.  but he doesn't seem to have the same hype around him."
Shut the fuck up about Ben Fucking Simmons jesus Fucking christ
"I just think it's hilarious that they spent 5 years shitting on Ben simmons and are now calling the diet version of Simmons ""their guy""."
"It's weird... part of why he said he wanted to come to Chicago was that Billy Donovan told him he'd be more of a classic point guard. Now that he's here, he's... leading transitions and playing great defense and on offense if anything he's gotten a little bit of Ben Simmons Disease at times, making a pass into a lower-percentage shot when he had a better opportunity to take himself.  Of course it's very, very early, and ""traditional 1"" or not, he's playing crunchtime minutes alongside a guy who's too small to be anything but a pure 1 (Caruso) and two guys who can do more of the classic drive-and-kick PG things (Lavine and Derozan) and that's probably determining things more than anything else. Also, again it's very early and I don't want to sound mean, but winning games cures a lot of these ""I want a bigger piece of the pie"" type complaints."
"It's not that Jimmy couldn't stand him.  Wiggins just doesn't play up to his potential and is content with mediocrity. The whole sub gets on Ben Simmons for not improving or developing a jump shot, but Wiggins was basically the same player the whole time he was on the Wolves. He's gotten better on the Warriors, but a good role player was not what people for expected of him when he was the unanimous 1st pick and when he got his max deal.     This is from Jimmy's interview with Rachel Nichols.  ""Am I being tough on him? Yeah, that's who am I,"" he said. ""I'm not the most talented player on the team. Who is the most talented player on our team -- KAT. Who is the most god-gifted player on our team -- Wiggs. Who plays the hardest? Me! I play hard. I put my body (on the line) every day in practice, every day in games. That's my passion. Everybody leads in different ways. That's how I show I'm here for you."""
I am a Raptors fan who specifically searches r/nba for 'Scottie Barnes' and sorts by new all the time and this take is overblown.  He's represented on here about as much as any good rookie over the years.   We can go back to all posting about Ben Simmons though if you want.
Ben Simmons. Started in 2018. Increased ten-fold when his fans were saying that Embiid threw him under the bus.
To be with Ben Simmons.  Always have a fall guy.
We all are Ben Simmons in this blessed day.
Ben Simmons is a DPOY level defender.
"""But doctor... I am Ben Simmons..."""
Russell Westbrook and Ben Simmons are just the different sides of the same coin. Both can‚Äôt be counted on to win or play good in the playoffs at this point in time.
TIL: I am Ben Simmons.
Oh come on. Ben Simmons will be traded soon. Be patient
It was Ben Simmons fans but that problem solved itself
Where does Ben Simmons fit into this scenario
May I interest you in a slightly used Ben Simmons?
"i disagree and i think it's a huge disconnect between fans/this sub and NBA FOs.  it is not easy to be horrible and tank when you have decent players on the roster.  good players don't want to lose - there is very little incentive for them to do it.  ben simmons on the rockets last year would've wanted to show off his talent and put up big numbers as the main guy.  i'm not saying he would've carried his team to the postseason, but the rockets prob don't have the worst record in the league with him on the team.  if you think a team can tank just as easily with good players on the roster as they can with terrible players, there's no talking to you because it's like we're speaking different languages.  when the celtics traded pierce and KG to the nets for that haul of picks, there were some fans who were disappointed we didn't get any good players in return.  i remember saying that if they're not gonna win now, they should have as few win-now players on the roster to commit to a tank for a couple years.  the celtics ended up being pretty bad, getting the 6th overall pick, and drafting marcus smart.  if they had gotten some decent players in return instead of picks, the celtics would probably be in way worse shape today as a result.  IMO the harden to the rockets trade is completely indefensible; the only reason in the world i can think of that Presti doesn't deserve total hate for it is if his hand was forced by ownership.  but I'm not in these FOs and can only speculate about that kinda thing, so as a result I'm gonna blame the GM who gave away a perennial MVP candidate entering his prime for nothing.  that is completely inexcusable.  he could've had harden, KD, and westbrook all in their primes for years.  or even if he had moved on from westbrook, KD and Harden would've been a way better fit than Westbrook and KD were."
"it depends on if they would make more money in total - I have no idea what the sponsorship contract universe looks like in China but salary from their team is not the only way NBA stars make $$.  Also like - ben poopy simmons isn't the only ""socialite"" in the NBA and I don't think these guys would want to live in China."
So you don‚Äôt want Ben Simmons for HB
CJ really has been playing like he wants to get traded for Ben Simmons.
"Honestly, no not at all. Especially among younger Aussies, the idea of not liking someone for being ‚Äúsoft‚Äù is falling out of fashion pretty quick.  Aussies, in my opinion, are desperate to love Ben. We just need 2 things from a sportsperson for us to love them:  1. Don‚Äôt be a cunt.  2. Love us back.  Do both and we‚Äôll love you forever, no matter how you play.   Ben is a reserved, introverted guy. I‚Äôm of the opinion that a lot of the issues with him this off-season are mental health related, and the news recently has really vindicated that. Some people might not give him the benefit of the doubt, but I‚Äôve never seen him do anything to convince me he‚Äôs a bad guy. I feel like Aussies have a perception of being upbeat, extroverted, life-of-the-party types like Jingles, and Ben (like a lot of people) doesn‚Äôt fit that mould. I don‚Äôt think that makes him a cunt.  The thing for Aussies that rubs us the wrong way is that he‚Äôs never played for the senior national team. Some of the time, I think it‚Äôs fair. He skipped the 2016 Olympics to prepare for the draft. Giddey did the same this year too, and I can‚Äôt exactly blame either for it. And I really firmly believe that if this whole debacle with his sister and half-brother hadn‚Äôt happened (which was really the event that set all the dominos in motion for this showdown with the team, imo), then he would‚Äôve played at this Olympics. [It‚Äôs worth noting that the Head Coach of the Boomers has come out in defence of Ben and said that he had been in contact with the team all throughout the process](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.foxsports.com.au/basketball/nba-2021-ben-simmons-australian-boomers-philadelphia-76ers-brian-goorjian/news-story/bac9a3b924747e5397f9993d1e981071).   It is weird, though, that the best basketball player Australia has ever produced, a guy who has had opportunities to train with and play for Team USA coming out of College and turned it down and who has strapped up for the Junior sides, has never played for the country. You may have guessed, but I am fairly sympathetic to Ben, and it definitely rubs me the wrong way. He‚Äôs expressed that he wants to do it, and somehow it‚Äôs never happened.   I really think if Ben were a permanent fixture for the National Team, we‚Äôd all be on his side right now. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a cunt, but he needs to prove that he loves us back."
The lakers should look to acquire more talent during the mid-season with players like kyrie or ben simmons so that they can compete with a team like OKC
Ben Simmons. At least the others are playing
Will Rob Lowe let LeBron trade himself for Ben Simmons?
You may be thinking of the trade package rumored for Ben Simmons
The anti Ben Simmons
Russell Westbrook makes Josh Smith look like Ben Simmons
"&gt;  They were building the narrative the entire year.   Because it's an incredible narrative lol. How many players in NBA history have ever averaged a triple double over an entire season? Two. Once by Oscar Robertson and four times by Russ lol. People always argue that it's easier to do in today's league, yet the only players who have ever come close are LeBron, Harden, Ben Simmons, Luka, Kidd, Magic, MJ, Wilt and Oscar.  When somebody does something that hasn't been done in 50-60 years it tends to draw attention. Prior to Westbrook doing it, it was thought to be one of those unbreakable records that would never be touched. The narrative was built for a damn good reason."
Hey man. That can be tough. Just ask Ben Simmons
Except banton is Ben Simmons at home not scottie lol
"He might end up being the third point guard Rookie of the Year from Melbourne in the last ten years, following Kyrie Irving and Ben Simmons.  Insane strike rate for a foreign city. Or any city, really."
I am one of them. I know he shrinks in the playoffs.  Can we please trade WB for Ben Simmons or Kyrie Irving already (Staples center doesn‚Äôt require vaccination)???  Simmons would be happy as fuck in LA. His new mansion and his hoes are out here. He won‚Äôt be relied on to score
Presti: ok shai to Philly for Ben Simmons and all their draft picks   NBA: Sam please stop
"It‚Äôs happened so many times the last 5 games, he just swallows them up. Looks a lot like Ben Simmons on the perimeter"
Fellow Aussie here - BIG facts.  Ben Simmons is a young Californian socialite now. We don't know him? Lol
Ben Simmons
I think Melo should take the ben Simmons approach and stop shooting 3s
Fuck Ben Simmons
"Wasn't he supposed to be packaged with Fred, OG, and Pascal for Ben Simmons?"
He is as Australian as Ben Simmons is American
"Ben Simmons is a Career 14.7% 3 point shooter who is very young at 24 years old.  Dame Lillard is an aging guy who's shooting 8.3% from 3 this year, and who couldn't defend even when he wasn't geriatric.    Do you think the Trailblazers would accept Ben Simmons for Dame and a few first rounders?  Then maybe 76ers could flip him to a tanking team who can buy out his contract.  I just feel nobody is going to want to waste a max spot on a washed guy like Dame.  He's sort of in Kemba Walker territory, except Kemba is still spry."
"I used to despise Lonzo for obvious reasons, always extremely overrated and played poorly for the Lakers most of the time, just a distraction and nothing else. But it‚Äôs good to see him embracing the role player side of things, focusing on defense first, improving his jumper, distributing the ball, etc.. definitely not a star material (never was, never will), but he improved to be a very solid role player who has a place in this league, that‚Äôs nice. Embrace who you are, get better, work on your craft, etc.. you can‚Äôt deny these are positive outlooks for any ‚Äúprofession‚Äù really, Lonzo is like the complete opposite of Ben Simmons"
Hot Take: Scottie Barnes has improved more from Summer League + 5 NBA games than Ben Simmons in 4 years in the NBA
Ben Simmons without dating a Kardashian....  .... Better ban them from entering Canada just to be safe
Ben Simmons with a crazy motor and real offensive feel for the game.
Ben Simmons shade in this comment lmao
"So Ben Simmons should demand a trade to New Orleans to fix his jump shot? Damn, that's some magically gumbo your pushing there."
Don‚Äôt disrespect Ben Simmons like that
Ben Simmons would like to introduce himself
Haha quick! Guys! Look over there! It's Ben Simmons and Kyrie doing stuff! Don't pay attention to us!!
Ben Simmons with joy in his heart
"Imagine the Simmons to Rockets trade had gone through, Ben would probably be really missed by Philly fans now."
Everyone knows Ben Simmons has Roy locked up this year
Giddey is Ben Simmons -athleticsm +shooting
He looks like Ben Simmons at home.
He's a smart player and it's what's helping him get accustomed to the league so quick. Wait until he's done catching up and begins gameplanning against specific teams/players. If his work ethic is as advertised... watch out. We have Giannis with Ben Simmons vision.
Russ is Ben simmons if he wasnt afraid to shoot 3s
I think each of his games has been worse than the last lol  Today he played like Ben Simmons offensively
"Yes, Harden is definitely washed and the Nets should trade him for Ben Simmons.  /s if you didn‚Äôt already realize."
Ben Simmons with an unbreakable love for the game
Ed Rogers: I want Masai to trade for Ben Simmons  Masai: we have Ben Simmons at home  Ben Simmons at home except home-cooked perfection
Australia has to disown Ben Simmons and go all in on Giddey.
Ben Simmons with self confidence
"I don't think his value recovers until he's back and playing like himself, which I don't think happens with Doc there. The team won't play up to their expectations even after Ben is playing, so Morey starts leaking to media how the whole Ben fiasco was on Doc.   We'll hear stories on how Doc never wanted Simmons in the first place and he tried to 'poison the well' and undermine Morey, then right before all star break Doc is ultimately canned. Then  Ben will come back to life under the interim coach long enough to raise his trade value right before the deadline.  At least that's how I see things playing out as of right now."
Giddey this year 41.7% fg  Ben Simmons 0%  Therefore giddey &gt; Simmons
Harden is playing like Ben Simmons right now and not like the level of player he is  He seems afraid to shoot
Does Harden even take shots anymore lol  He's playing like Ben Simmons
"Which is my point, Ben Simmons and a top 3 pick &gt; a top 3 pick, literal garbage that you had to dump, and middling firsts"
"This kind of shows how formulaic the league is. And it's kind of like the Ben Simmons problem. How can you have a point guard that never shoots?  Just because it's never been done, doesn't make it impossible. A successful player doesn't have to just be great in a traditional sense.  The risk is, that if it doesn't work, the plan B is so different that it would be a difficult adjustment for the rest of the team. Plus most coaches that try something different and fail get fired."
Ben Simmons doesnt shoot threes because he want other teams to win games as well. He truly is a man of honnor
Ben Simmons does not make last year's Rockets the 10th seed lol
Simmons can potentially win a chip with a star that isn't a centre. When embiid was out Ben was really good as a psuedo 5. He was still ball handling while playing the 5 and if I remember correctly dropped 43 on the jazz.   The spacing problem with having non shooters can't actually be fixed by philly as long as Simmons and embiid play together no matter how many shooters the have around them by virtue of having a star centre and a non shooter.  If Ben had another guard instead of embiid he could turn a team into what the small ball rockets were meant to be.
That Draymond Green is ass and that Ben Simmons is better than Joel Embiid. Really bought into the ‚Äútriple single‚Äù crap and severely overvalued Ben being able to play multiple position
"I get Morey wanting to wait till December or January to trade Ben, simply because that's when more players will be eligible to be traded. But he needs to recognize that Simmons trade value is not what he wants it to be and it's never going to be there. He needs to stop this charade of trying to have Ben rejoin the team. Just send him home until he can trade him in a couple months and let that be the end of it.   And he needs to trade him this year. This nonsense about being willing to drag it out four years is absurd. Simmons trade value is never going up, not while he's a Sixer. Philly waited too long to trade him and now he's a depressed asset for them. They need to just accept the best offer out there an move on, even if that offer doesn't make them a contender. It is what it is."
"Embiid and Morey are extremely close. That was the only positive news to come out of the summer, and I know it got overshadowed by Simmons stuff.   Morey is not making a single personnel decision or non-decision without Embiid‚Äôs approval.   If Embiid says he wants to trade Ben for John Wall Morey would do it and every Sixers fan would accept that it was Joel‚Äôs will."
"You‚Äôre literally wrong. Ben has been first team all-defense twice and was second in DPOY voting last season. Ben has also played two less seasons than Rondo had by the time he had those accolades at 25. So you can try and take things out of context and then say stupid things like ‚Äúwhy are you fighting this‚Äù all you want, you‚Äôre wrong, Ben Simmons is a much better defender than Rondo ever was"
"The Ben Simmons with a mentally change thing is a joke, this is who he's been since college, you're not changing him"
"The sixers already lost the instant this all happened. I don't see any way they can salvage this. They aren't going to get an all star level player back, trading ben for literally nothing will still have them over the cap so no free agents, and picks aren't going to help with Embiid's age.   The only play they can make so they can still contend is for Simmons to play. To either raise his trade value or to become a better player and keep playing for them."
"&gt; every time the sixers get beat up or choke a game without ben his value goes up  Ah yes, Ben Simmons, the notorious 4th quarter performer who would never let his team choke a game."
"My dude, they severely fucked up the tank/process already. That ship has sailed. They were the worst team in the league for many years and only got Embiid out of it. There's no team in the league that's going to say ""oh our bad, here's Dame Lillard (or equal value) for Ben Simmons"" unless he comes back and starts raining down threes with a positive attitude for a full season."
"I‚Äôll put more scrutiny on Morey, he may be placing too much trade value on Simmons. Bens contract is big, but they could get some good pieces. The only issue I have with Rivers is he shouldn‚Äôt have been so honest publicly last season when asked if they could win with Ben and he said ‚Äúno‚Äù. Should have kept that in house, in my opinion."
"This is a joke. Simmons is not mentally unfit to play, he's a spoiled brat playing the system. It's so obvious because this is the only way he still gets paid...I get it, but don't defend it because it's an insult to all athletes who are actually facing mental health issues and are not using them to a) force a trade, b) get paid obscene amounts of money to NOT play in a league in which most of us would die to actually play just one minute, for one of the historic franchises... Fuck Ben Simmons. Seriously."
Luka + 2 firsts and Josh Green for Ben Simmons is his fair trade.  Maybe a couple pick swaps for good measure.
"I'll do you one better, _when_ is Ben Simmons?"
Ben Simmons
Anyone else confused thinking this said Ben Simmons lol
"2 rookie years, he think he Ben Simmons"
"in the first quarter Doc Rivers says he talked to Ben Simmons pre game and reminded him ""he's Ben Simmons, not a championship level PG"". Simmons misses a three and points at Rivers as the Sixers call time"
Draymond turning into Ben Simmons before our eyes
Draymond pulling a bit of a Ben Simmons on that one. Take the shot my dude
"ngl man you're kinda wasting your breath with this stuff. even though you're completely right. people have been criticizing luka for a bad plus/minus since before covid. it was dumb back then and its dumb now. its hard to get people to understand that no individual player can be accurately represented by a plus/minus; you're really just measuring the performance of the lineups that include that player. which isn't the same as measuring an individual player's contribution to those lineups.  or, to put it another way, heres you:  &gt;I've been watching a lot of their games  and heres the people criticizing luka for a low plus/minus:  &gt;The thing is, they‚Äôre in the positives with him off the floor.  Anybody with half a basketball brain can watch this team and realize the Mavs are a way worse team with him off the floor. But the people who watch bballref instead of the games can find all sorts of reasons why the Mavs should just cut him from the roster or trade him for Ben Simmons."
"""If we don't have at least a 15 point lead at the end of the 3rd somebody's getting traded for Ben Simmons"" - Kerr at halftime every game"
"It's strange to me for 2 reasons.  One I think it is pretty common in the MLB (though I cannot find numbers for current no trade clauses) so the fact that there is none in the NBA strikes me as strange.  Two, teams' ability to trade players whenever they want is often the players' general response to player empowerment criticism.  It strikes me as strange that teams' lack of loyalty is often a source of complaint amongst players when they theoretically have some power to prevent such a thing.   There is also the scenario in which a player is forcing his way out of town.  Anthony Davis tried very hard to force his way to the Lakers and it eventually worked, but he could have guaranteed it if he had a no trade clause he would only waive to go to the Lakers.  Ben Simmons probably wouldn't mind one right now so he could stop any trades to unwanted teams."
Ben Simmons is somewhere raising his hand
"Nothing has ever simultaneously made more sense ,and less sense, to me than Kyrie for Ben Simmons"
Shhhh. Most casual nba fans are D riders. They will say kobe is a ball hog but he avg 5 assist a game in his prime.   They will say Ben simmons is trash but he's a 3 year consecutive all star.   They will say Luka has no help but he chooses to have the highest usage rate. While harden did both and won. Luka is closer to westbrook than to harden. Guess the honey moon phase is still going on.  Trae young is better
"Probably is only probable, doesn‚Äôt mean it would happen. Joel Embiid at Center, Jimmy Butler that mercy swept MIL, Tobias Harris, JJ Spot up shooter Reddick, and Ben Simmons is different than Kyle Lowry, FVV, DG, Pascal, Kawhi, and Gasol. Different teams, different play styles. Sixers were stacked but Kawhi was better. Let‚Äôs bot forget the Bucks were perennial chokers until the Nets, Hawks, Lakers/Clippers/Warriors injuries"
Trade for Ben Simmons
"The biggest risk is sending out a player like Ben Simmons, a 6'11"" point forward who has already been a 3x All Star, All NBA 3rd team, 2xAll Defense 1st team, 25 year old on a four year deal for peanuts.   That to me is by far a bigger risk than punting on this season. Embiid has several more years to contend as the best player on a championship team, Morey is smart to take the long view on this, at least in my opinion."
*something something \~insert overused Ben Simmons Joke\~*
Ben Simmons
we get practice highlights all the time for stars that have been injured for a long time  we even got a few for Ben Simmons just shooting randomly.
"Sixers had the ultimate playoff bum with Ben Simmons tho, they were never winning shit. Probably get swept by the Bucks in the ECF if they made it past Toronto."
Hes the bizarro ben simmons
"If you set team record aside altogether, he absolutely was worthy of a spot over Ben Simmons (voted as a guard) in 2019-20 in my opinion. That year, Booker averaged 27 and 7 on 62% TS and I believe he was the league leader in points produced per touch (via points and assists). But, the Suns missed the playoffs by half a game.   In 2018-19, once again setting team records aside, I believe that Booker was more worthy than Kemba Walker of 3rd team honors. (I do not disagree with this selection, I‚Äôm just explaining that Kemba got in because of team record, which is valid)    I definitely think that team record should have a major impact on All-NBA selections, which is why I think Booker would be deserving of All-NBA First team if the season ended today."
Yeah maybe if he changed his name to Ben Simmons Liberty id remember it
"Nope, blake Griffin was pulling a ben simmons focusing on his social status and cp3 called him out and questioned his want to win. You dont know what youre talkin bout. This is all documented. Blake Griffin will never make it to the finals unless hes on the bench getting carried."
"Ben Simmons for Kemba, someone else and picks"
"Part of it is that Lavine had already poached him.  Pels weren‚Äôt too excited about him, but if Pels had tried to keep him Zo would‚Äôve signed QO and dipped the next season for free.  Lonzo is a legit 3rd option on a contender if the transition take fouls get removed too imo. Add to the fact that he is constantly evolving, him adding a reliable finishing package is not out of the cards.  But even without that, he‚Äôs a player every team wants. All NBA caliber defense, can make every pass, elite 3pt shooter, and like Ben Simmons he becomes more valuable the faster the game is played. In those little 2-3-4 minutes stretches where it‚Äôs a perpetual run out, he‚Äôs an allstar.  Pels would‚Äôve kept him if he 100% wanted to stay."
He can‚Äôt take Ben Simmons place because they are in different conferences
Crazy what a little effort can do for your shooting abilities eh Mr. Simmons? If someone like Jonas can improve to the point where he's become a competent 3 point shooter Ben has no excuse. It's pure lack of caring and effort.
"Trae Young was not vastly superior to Ben Simmons when Ben got the all-star nod. People hating because of how bad he was in the playoffs, but Ben is an all-star when he's on his game."
"What I'm getting at is that simply looking at stats isn't a sole arbitrator of how we should apply our values to a player.  I think of how the Pacers traded for Evan Turner who was putting up quality numbers but looked horrible on our team because his numbers were skewed from the team he was on.  High volume, low efficiency players make the all star game all the time as well. Melo, Westbrook, etc?   It's just to say that there are other factors that are a part and to simply say that if they have X/Y then they are in regardless of Z, is to say that Z is not related to X/Y.  JV should be in regardless of these things simply from the eye test. Put him in in Ben Simmons place."
"it clearly matters a lot, since ben fucking simmons got the coaches nod over a vastly superior player in trae"
"Meh, at least they aren't stuck with Ben Simmons, $40 mil down the drain every year"
"Some of the greatest players in NBA history weren‚Äôt scorers. Look at Ben Wallace. There‚Äôs more to performance than scoring, but yes, I think that to perform as an ‚Äúelite‚Äù, you‚Äôve gotta think you can do it. Simmons not being the #1 option on his team is not the reason I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a great NBA player, but yes, his crippling insecurity plays a big part. Contracts do not an elite player make, and as it stands Benny boi is not even an NBA player at all."
"Alright, bet. But can I get a Kyrie or Ben Simmons update, please? It's been a minute."
"Every time you take a shot you have to yell ""BEN SIMMONS"""
I think you have built an argument that you will never disagree with. To be great you have to think you are the best option to think you will score among your teammates. So someone like Ben Simmons cannot be considered great to you despite his max contract and being an elite NBA player.
Somewhere out there is Ben Simmons crying
Ben Simmons in shambles.
This is wild. From a dude who barely shot triples to this. Mr Ben Simmons take note.
It‚Äôs going to be his best chance to win it from reigning ROY Ben Simmons‚Ä¶
"Trading Damian Fucking Lillard for whatever the fuck Ben Simmons even is right now is completely laughable, and the fact that people seriously think it's a fair trade is absolutely wild to me."
Passing a three for a better three: smart  Passing a layup for a three: genius  Passing an open shot for a pass to a contested teammate: Ben Simmons
"I, personally, am a fan of the Mavs first and players second (though I love plenty of players who aren't Mavs). My honest question is how do we improve with no cap space and a very limited selection of first round picks? The Mavs have repeatedly mortgaged the future for 2 decades. How long, in this era, does Luka put up with the team around him? While I won't assume we can't win with him... we don't want to get to a state where we see an Anthony Davis (limited his options by saying he wouldn't re-sign with other teams) or Ben Simmons situation."
Thankfully. I almost forgot who Ben Simmons was for minute.
JV shot for more 3-pointers in less than 1.5 quarters than Ben Simmons' career.
JV shot for more 3-pointers in less than 1.5 quarters than Ben Simmons' career.
"&gt;Portland is a good fit for Ben Simmons  If it's a full rebuild (and it would be if Dame is gone), there is no way to say it Simmons is a good fit. We don't know who else would be on the roster.   Also seems like a full tear down would make a lot more sense than trying to retool around Simmons."
"No, Simmons‚Äô lack of development or even attempting of jump shots is a Ben Simmons problem that he is chiefly at fault for."
JV shot more 3-pointers in less than 1.5 quarters than Ben Simmons' career.
By gawd that‚Äôs Ben Simmons music
"It has to be demoralizing getting smashed by two of the West's contenders, and I don't mean that in some type of mean-spirited way. I would like to see Portland do well, but I think the writing is on the wall with this team. Their core has invested a lot in this ""project"" over the years and you can probably only grind for so long before it becomes apparent that you're never going to get over the hump. Does anyone in that locker room really believe they can win a Finals this year?   I would trade Dame, back up the Brinks truck for Simons (Anfernee), and try something different. I've taken heat for suggesting that Portland is a good fit for Ben Simmons, but really I do think he could be an interesting piece there. Meanwhile it would be doing Dame a solid to get him to Philly with a legit chance to make a Finals before his prime is up. Tough to lose your talisman and icon, but a long-term win-win for all sides potentially."
"He‚Äôs been like a 50% shooter from three this year.   Yes, 7 of 7 is always going to be a shock, but don‚Äôt act like he‚Äôs Ben Simmons"
Not a Franchise but Ben Simmons passing that dunk Changed his Life früò≠üò≠
Jazz fan who actually likes Ben Simmons checking in. I've always been a sucker for great defenders (Rudy is my favorite Jazz player).
Ben Simmons and Kyrie
"Pat Bev, Rondo, Lebron, PG, CP. Runner up Ben Simmons"
Ben simmons is garbage.   A super casual that doesn't know they are one will think a pg is the most important/ best players in the modern nba when it's actually the  forward .   Mikey Williams will be a star in the nba
"He‚Äôs 43% from 3 this year and has improved every year, while Ben basically just refuses to shoot 3s and is 14% in his career. One of them clearly put the work in to become a better shooter.  Lonzo‚Äôs FT shooting has also steadily improved while Simmons has remained stagnant"
"Biggest thing is that he's cheap, so you won't have an issue keeping him on the bench during crunch time compared to someone like Roberson or Ben Simmons."
Wait a minute. I need some clarity from the Ben simmons slander. People saying Ben simmons take notes etc... for a guy avg 12 5 5 on 41% fg  bruh
Ben Simmons custom made warrior
Present Day Ben Simmons still doesn't take LSU to the tournament.
"My only disagreement here is that NBA basketball isn't that match-up dependent.  Especially on a team like the Blazers, where we lack any elite 1-on-1 or perimeter defenders, the scheme is designed around switching and drop defense.  Any player can force a switch onto the defender they want.  That's why teams target Dame and CJ a lot of the time, or quick players target someone like Nurkic to pull him to the perimeter.  Norm doesn't just get to match-up against a 3 because he's in our line-up.  He switches defensively pretty much 1-4, 1-5 and is supposed to lead his guy into the help, where both RoCo and Nurkic are expected to help.    Norm is just fine on any 3, as far as any player/defender would be up to the elite defenders.  Obviously, if you have a healthy Kawhi, or someone like Mikal Bridges or Ben Simmons, they're game changers for on-ball defense.  Outside the top tier guys, though, he's about the same as anyone.  Players like LeBron, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi offensively are going to be a mismatch for anybody.  He does as well as you could hope.   If he played the 2, he would likely be guarding the same people because of switching."
Do you think a Ben Simmons and CJ McCollum swap would benefit your team?
"Kyrie quit on the team. He has Ben Simmons disease. Check the DSM, it's diagnosable."
"Yeah I mean the issue that you've highlighted is that with a lot of proposed trades, you have to navigate the crater that Ben Simmons left in the roster. Playing three guards at once makes sense when one of them is 6'11. But all of a sudden we've got Maxey starting and billion wings with various deficiencies. Swapping out a power forward for CJ makes sense when Ben is on the court, otherwise it makes very little and would require some other move.  I think the end result is that we're gonna have to package someone with Ben to get it done, mostly from a positional perspective. I'd love an on-ball scorer but most don't make sense with either Seth or Maxey. I'm morbidly curious what a Ben + Seth package could get us."
"Nuggets don‚Äôt really have the pieces to use mpj as a center piece for a trade for someone like Ben Simmons for example, dont really have big salaries to match. And getting picks just puts you back in the same situation, looking for your third big bannana.  If the goal is wining a championship, you take the bet that you end up with 3 all stars and win a title off that. Otherwise you‚Äôre just treading water at best."
"It‚Äôs just feels like we need someone like Boogie. Or maybe make a trade somehow and try to get Derrick White and Ben Simmons, we got enough scorer anyway.. get rid of MPJ, Bol, Rivers, Facu, Jamaycal Green, and maybe even Monte."
Ben Simmons baby.
"No, Ben Simmons has made a few times without 20 ppg."
Read that headline and just laughed.   God how I wish Morey's price for Ben Simmons wasn't batshit insane
"I know it sucks to relate everything to Ben Simmons, but for some reason I always compare him to Giannis in terms of what might have been.  I‚Äôm so jealous of the Bucks, Giannis is the perfect franchise player  (So is Embiid, he just needs more help)"
"Tatum is a toddler, Ben Simmons for ROTY (when he isn't being a young socialite), Zion is a chonkerino"
how come every other non-American player keeps their strong Accent but Ben Simmons ?   does he speak to purposefully sound more American?
"This isn‚Äôt a joke, but would you trade Fred and siakam for Simmons? Would allow Ben to take all the time he needs, would ensure the tank and a top pick, and give Scottie all the game reps he could ever want. Then you‚Äôre looking spooky next year."

"Scottie excels in transitional, post, and top of the key passing. He has great court vision and is comparable to that of Giddey and Cunningham. What he lacks compared to those guys is playmaking. PnR or running plays is not his forte. People get passing and playmaking confused. Like Ben Simmons is a great passer but a horrible playmaker that's why the Sixers never get anywhere even though they have prime Embiid"
He should get Ben Simmons to be his training partner and use that as video.
Lol all I can think when I see this is rich Paul complaining about Ben Simmons not getting paid for choosing not to play and how wall wasn‚Äôt playing and getting paid when in Houston it‚Äôs the rockets telling wall he can‚Äôt play and him wanting to play.   The warriors hype has drowned out the Ben Simmons saga but when I look back at it rich Paul and Simmons just seem like more and more of dickheads
Have the Nuggets ever really had that elite perimeter defender to guard these guys? I‚Äôm sure if they had a guy like Jrue Holiday or even Ben Simmons they‚Äôd be fine.
Ben Simmons?
Ben Simmons
"Serious answer to a troll question:  Attitude: Winner. Energizer. Hype man. Hustler.  Body: Giannis  Passing: Magic   Shooting: he shot 4/9 from 3 tonight and his midrange is great. He's working up to becoming a good shooter, kinda like Ben Simmons but actually putting in work and shooting well. I see him shooting around Kawhi's level of he reaches his shooting ceiling.   Finishing: Kawhi/Giannis once he's confident with his physicality.  Handles: underrated, he's got a lightning quick first step and a good handle for his size.  Basically, this guy was the ""project player"" of the draft - everyone said his shooting was crap and his game was raw and unpolished. This guy is playing the best out of all the rookies and already looks like what we thought he would look like in 3 years. 3 years. He's shooting a LOT better than he ought to be and his game is looking dominant and polished. The ceiling for Scottie is undoubtedly the highest we've had in awhile (looking at you Simmons), and he has the attitude and mindset to reach his potential. He should've gone number 1."
"I mean sure, but Draymond would pair well with any off ball threat, including KD. Like Draymond is really good, but I don't think he unlocks Steph in a way that a guy like a Ben Simmons or Jimmy Butler or whatever other playmaking forward doesn't.  And this shows in the numbers. Draymond plus Steph is really really good, but Steph and 3 and D players is still really good."
Melo looking like Ben Simmons out here
"They literally said the sixers could have used ben simmons this game, wtf does that have to do with last playoffs? You don't have to insult simmons every time his name comes up man."
ben simmons-esque except that tatum wasnt afraid to take shots in the 4th
"Uhhhh, yet again, never mentioned Steph‚Ä¶. So i have no clue what you‚Äôre getting at. My point is just that Davion is not Jrue or Ben Simmons level, he‚Äôs not close to that right now. Could he be? Sure, but his off ball and screen defense is not close to that of those guys atm.   That‚Äôs not even a slight, Jrue just happens to be the best perimeter defender in the league and Ben came in 3rd in DPOY."
Not even close. I‚Äôm saying Davion Mitchell isn‚Äôt on the same tier as Jrue Holiday or Ben Simmons. My comment wasn‚Äôt referring to Steph at all.
Wall  Westbrook  Love  Kyrie  Ben Simmons  In roughly that order  Special shoutout to harris for being a ~10 mil player on a max.
"Trade Ben Simmons for KAT, twin towers. Who says no."
"You think Celtics are willing to give up Schroder, jaylen brown and a pick for fucking Ben Simmons and Marvin Bagley are you out of your mind"
Why are these comments in every Steph post lol  You guys act like he played like Ben Simmons with KD  In fact his off ball game got way better playing with him and probably also extended his prime
"Yeah, what happened to this sub?  I need my Ben Simmons content."
"I actually agree with this. The thing is because of recovery. Same thing when you work out too much and dont rest. Your muscles can literally fail or die. I'll get downvoted for this again, but Ben Simmons should be playing and helping the 76ers out more. They are putting too much on Embiid"
Let‚Äôs not pretend like 2020/2021 regular season Ben Simmons didn‚Äôt deserve to be called up.
Eric bledsoe and  ben simmons
Ben Simmons put jokic in his 75. Literally the only reason I still listen to his pod. Can‚Äôt be that dumb then haha
"Depends  First take covers a lot more topics but fast. And Stephen a can only do so much. Also Molly is annoying af   Undisputed has fewer topics to cover. And they‚Äôre clearly biased on what they want to cover(LeBron, cowboys, Brady, etc) but Undisputed is at its best when they do topics they aren‚Äôt biased in. Like the Ben Simmons situation, or Deshaun Watson scandal. They provide good analysis in those. But otherwise, ignore unless you‚Äôre a fan of the aforementioned topics they‚Äôre biased in.   Or if you‚Äôre into cowboys suffering. Angry Skip is the best."
"Dragic scored himself a ""consensual Ben Simmons"" arrangement. Very nice for him."
*Ben Simmons and Kyrie theme song intensifies*
"If you take Ben Simmons, you're trying to show what he can do with great spacing to showcase his value, then sell him for even more picks."

Tacko Fall has made more 3‚Äôs than Ben Simmons
"If you think Ben Simmons is still a developing young player, who‚Äôll get meaningfully better over the next few years - you take the Philly deal all day.  If you think Simmons is he who is, and he‚Äôs basically in his prime right now - you take the Brooklyn deal. Rebuilding &gt; building around the ~20th best player in the NBA without a half court offense skillset and whose value will never be higher.  The Rockets clearly thought the latter. I think most Sixers fans do too tbh."
"Exactly, one does not simply trade John Wall‚Äôs contract.  So either you attach a lot of assets just to dump him, or you trade Ben Simmons‚Äîat which point, why not just take the Nets deal?"
"Ben Simmons can't shoot consistently in real game situations where team think he is a threat. He is not a scorer this season, and he hasn't gotten any better. In the playoffs good teams will sag off him if Simmons is running PnR in halfcourt. Unless Doc somehow unlock Ben Simmons mind to have a better plan in scoring Ben Simmons looks like a player who plateau. He is still a useful player, but not with Embiid."
Wait what? Ben Simmons has a bad shot but he‚Äôs elite at pretty much everything else. Simmons is good finishing in the lane and is an elite passer and great defender  A Ben Simmons and shooters lineup would be really damn good in the nba.
Seriously. Giannis was not the reason the Bucks won last night.  They had him avoiding the ball like Ben Simmons in the last four minutes of the game lol.
Already a better 3-point shooter then Ben Simmons
Was wondering how long I‚Äôd have to scroll for a Ben Simmons joke üòÇ
"Nah this stuff happens all the time. It‚Äôs just under a microscope now because it‚Äôs James Harden and Ben Simmons in question. Players get traded or not traded with lots of confusion, hurt feelings, etc. Players talk about trade rumors as really fucking with them, it‚Äôs just part of the business."
"First and foremost, I really don't think he's talked about more than Harden Kyrie or Bron. Especially not in recent months.  I'm not personally looking for threads shitting on Simmons (it's reddit I'm sure they exist). But the criticism he gets is more than valid.  Could Ben still develop? Of course! I think he will too. But after multiple years he hasn't....and it's absurd. Taking 1 jumper a game would not ruin the team or his confidence and he hasn't even taken that step. No one wants him to be Josh Smith and throwing up bullshit.  But look at him compared to Giannis. Giannis who clearly isn't a great shooter.... attempts to shoot and shows progress with the different shots he takes. Giannis has made 18 threes this year @ 30 percent. Ben has made 3 threes in his career....  It's not just about threes. But are we to believe Ben can't shoot 30 percent from 3 on 82 shots a season? That's literally nothing to ask and instead were supposed to believe it's better for the coaching staff to have developed a better game plan and strategy that allows Ben to be a complete non offensive threat for multiple years across two different coaches until he ""develops"" sometime?  Ben was the #1 overall pick. The criticism is valid and frankly he can do better! I believe in him."
Ben Simmons in shambles
They're not tanking. They're rebuilding their coffers.  If they get Ben Simmons where to they go from there? They have no cap space and and no draft picks to make a trade and their team is significantly worse than the Sixers are now.
"keep saying that. let's give him the ben simmons treatment on the three, see how far it gets ya"
Isn‚Äôt Ben Simmons also shooting better percentage wise?
Better shooter than Ben Simmons?
He's like the anti Ben Simmons.
Tacko Fall is a better shooter than Ben Simmons
"Since when? Bigs/interior guys have dominated the award for the last 5-6 years while Marcus Smart and Ben Simmons types barely get a look in specifically because their impact is so much greater. Before that you had Kawhi, whose impact stats were unbelievable, but eventually they fell off and he stopped being a contender."
"I can't believe people could be so simple minded as to think he just decided he doesn't want to be a good shooter. I can't believe if he doesn't literally get on tv and tell you exactly why he doesn't shoot in games as much as most guards that people automatically say to themselves ""he must not want to be the best player in the league.""  Dude must hate success and money and thus wants to limit them.   And people keep ""defending him"" because he gets talked about the most on this sub behind Kyrie, Harden, and LeBron. If someone who didn't know basketball just got the raw numbers of topics dedicated to players on this sub without having access to the titles or their content, he would think Ben Simmons is one of the greatest players of all time."
List of cowards:  - Ben Simmons  List of non-cowards:  - Tacko Fall
1. Jokic     2. LeBron 3. CP3  4. Ben Simmons 5. James Harden 6. Luka  7a. Lamelo Ball 7b. Lonzo Ball  9. Domas Sabonis 10. Dame Lillard  HM: Facundo
Don't be disingenuous. Those picks have a chance of being very good (just ask Boston).  The problem is that it is a high-risk move whereas Simmons is a known commodity.  The Simmons deal was a good deal. The Brooklyn deal could land anywhere from 'meh' to 'astounding'. Jury will be out on this one until 2027 (at *least*) and there is literally no way to know until then short of Ben Simmons having a career ending injury.
"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a business‚Äù, and you‚Äôre trying to draft good young players to build your franchise around - like Ben Simmons  The fact that Tillman was going cheap and *everybody* wanted out of there says a lot.   Harden was the last one left, but he wasn‚Äôt the first."
"Man I hate Tillman too but you really need to give it up, you comment about him more than any Rockets fan. What are Ben Simmons and John Wall going to compete for the next couple years? Just like the Lakers did before they got AD and LeBron the Rockets are choosing to bottom out."
"He has a ben Simmons infatuation, so it's usually about him hating on Ben.  Not really sure tbh"
I bet Houston will end up drafting a guy in like 2026 or 2027 who ends up better than Ben Simmons.
nah the picks package isn't bad at all with harden and KD already in their 30s. I wouldn't build a team around ben simmons. Man can't score in halfcourt in the playoffs
"Per 36:    Simmons: 16.9/8.7/8.7/1.8/0.9, 55.7% TS on 22.3% USG   Ja: 20.7/4.5/8.5/1.0/0.3, 55.6% TS on 25.9% USG    KAT: 20.6/11.8/2.2/0.8/1.9, 59.0% TS on 24.7% USG    Luka: 23.7/8.7/6.7/1.2/0.4, 54.5% TS on 30.5% USG     LaMelo: 16.8/9.8/8.9/2.3/0.5, 49.9% TS on 23.7% USG    Wiseman: 19.1/10.6/0.7/0.7/2.7, 52.4% TS on 24.0% USG    Haliburton: 15.7/3.6/7.1/1.6/0.5, 70.1% TS on 15.1% USG    Edwards: 18.3/4.2/2.8/0.8/0.3, 46.2% TS on 26.1% USG  LaMelo is the only one with a real per-36 case against those four.  Also, on average Wiseman has fouled out.  Besides, instead of only saying ""these guys would be putting up Luka numbers if they played more,"" one should also ask, ""if these guys are as good as Luka, why wouldn't they be getting played more?""  Would Luka or Ben be languishing behind Devonte Graham in the guard rotation?  Would the Warriors pass up the chance to play KAT 25 or 30 minutes a game?  Sometimes the status quo is dumb, but a lot of times things are the way they are for a reason.  That said, I don't think this really means anything.  Players don't actually scale to their per-36 numbers with more minutes.  Rookies often get drastically better over a season, or hit a wall partway through.  The rookies coming off the bench are spending less time against opposing starters.  No one got training camp this year.  None of these stats show Simmons' defense and as little offensive data as we have on this year's rookies, we have even less on defense - nothing but the eye test.  13 games in, it's all total guesswork."
Love me some Ben Simmons
"100% Ben Simmons. He might be fun to root for but to me, he comes off as insanely arrogant and smug for someone that only really shows up when he gets called out."
*clever Ben Simmons joke*
The disrespect for Ben Simmons smh
Tacko &gt; Ben Simmons
Ben SimmonsüëÄ
Tacko Fall has as many 3 pointers as Ben Simmons
Better shooter than Ben Simmons tell me I‚Äôm wrong
John Wall and Ben Simmons lmao.. can you think of a worse all star guard pairing?
Ben simmons. Just can‚Äôt stand looking at his bitch face. Overrated as fuck.
I don't think the Wall Simmons fit is a big deal like everyone keeps saying. If you're getting Simmons you're riding out the next 2 years of Wall and finding ways to build around Ben. Wall is not a long term proposition.
Ben Simmons bc he wouldn't play for Australia in the one FIBA exhibition match I could go to
Tacko Fall has more range than Ben Simmons
"If Tacko can do this, there is nothing Ben Simmons can say to justify not shooting about half a dozen bare minimum 3s per game"
Ben simmons steaming rn
ben simmons
"This sub if filled with dumbass 10 year olds who look for any and every chance to meme. Somehow a 6‚Äô11‚Äù guy not shooting 3s became the biggest meme on this awful sub because he‚Äôs listed as a PG on b-ref I guess. The Simmons/Embiid pairing on offense will never be perfect, but defensively it‚Äôs special and Simmons is a helluva player. I like the idea that‚Äôs been floated around of the Sixers trading for Kyle Lowry. He can be the primary ball handler in the half court and Ben can function as a something of a Draymond Green on steroids."
"Damn, Ben Simmons is now a joke to you.   I remember the Simmons vs Luka debates."
HOW LONG IT TAKE BEN SIMMONS TO HIT A THREE?
More confident shooter than Ben Simmons and I am only kind of kidding
Ben Simmons + thybulle makes the current rockets offer look like absolute dogshit.   Killing your future to own the sixers.
Fucking foot was on the line. My ‚ÄúTacko hit a three earlier in his career than Ben Simmons‚Äù take will have to wait for another day.
This is the moment to start a serious discussion about who would you rather have as your point center: Tacko Falls or Ben Simmons
Tacko shoots better than Ben Simmons.
Suck on that Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons would never
"Yeah instead you got Victor Oladipo, who‚Äôs 28 and injury prone, and who your cheap owner reportedly wants to get rid of to save salary anyways... but maybe with one of those 4 draft picks you could land a player like maybe say Ben Simmons, who is only 24, an all-star, and one of the best defenders and passers in the league."
"The nets package is better in a long term view.   Sure they could‚Äôve had Simmons and tried to build around him, but quite frankly they‚Äôre most likely not a playoff team in the west and have to commit to paying wall and Eric Gordon 100+mill for the next 2 seasons. By the time they can actually start to construct a roster, Ben Simmons would be disgruntled, their late picks would probably manifest into players drafted in the late 20‚Äôs and they‚Äôd be banking on FA wanting to play there.   With the nets offer the picks are so far away there is a VERY good chance none of harden, KD, kyrie are on the team and that we‚Äôre the worst team in the league again, giving the rockets the perfect opportunity to do exactly what the Celtics did."
Ben Simmons is not consistently great and is a bad fit next to Embiid who is a far superior player in all aspects. People consistently point to how they pushed the Raptors to the brink but that wouldn't have happened without Jimmy Butler.
"That's not true, it would put us into the tax which would put us in the repeater tax, so we can't do that.   Also, Ben Simmons isn't worth Nu4k+RoCo+our picks, before including we'd need to send another 3.7m, which we don't have a contract for. (Could he Collins, Kanter, or 2 rookie contracts that aren't Collins.)  We don't want him for what we have to give up."
"The rockets got a lot of picks, and if they‚Äôre really lucky, maybe one of those players could be... I dunno... a Ben Simmons!"
Because what are the chances of getting a player as good as Ben Simmons in your next three picks?
What if no one tells Tilman and the moment deal is done you trade Ben Simmons and Thybulle + the picks for Harden.
"&gt; He can't do that in this Sixers team because Embiid is a better inside scorer than Simmons and a better FT shooter.   It's not like we haven't seen Ben Simmons on the floor without Embiid. He still doesn't look like someone who can lead an offense.             &gt; In his own team with an actual playmaker, Simmons becomes a Giannis lite guy. He should not be the primary playmaker in any team, just like Giannis.     So, Ben is a much worse scorer than Giannis, and also has the same playmaking issue that Giannis has, AND also is a much worse shooter. Given that even Giannis himself struggles in the postseason, how much faith do you have in Ben Simmons not having that problem?           Ben is best suited for a Pascal Siakam/Bam Adebayo role, in which he is not the primary scorer or primary playmaker."
Nobody is saying crazy high.  Someone is suggesting that ben simmons couldnt be flipped for good enough assets around the league.   Where the other option is tilman fertitta just continuing to be a petty/cheap piece of shit owner.   Why is it even a question at this point which it is?
"&gt; Nah I think Simmons can be close to being Giannis like if he was on his own team.    Just no, if it was easy for Ben to play like a 2 times MVP, he would have done that alreayd. Giannis has a much better scoring arsenal, and it's not even close."
Ben Simmons‚Ñ¢ is legit. Sixers are way better when he's in the lineup.
Ben Simmons will remember that
"&gt;and lost literally on the very last shot of a 7game series to the team who went on to win it all, which was one of the craziest fucking shots ever  You have to think, maybe it doesn't get to that point if Ben Simmons doesn't get completely neutralized on offense, in route to averaging 11 points and 5 assists over that series.  He hasn't improved his halfcourt offense in any meaningful way since that series. Which means he is likely to get neutralized again as soon as we go up against a good defense"
"And here we go again, Ben Simmons this season is forever in the space that Philly is supposedly worse off being doomed to tolerate him as a starter, and yet Houston totally fleeced themselves to NOT have him. These two all but completely contradictory thoughts exist peacefully in the minds of the media and, seemingly, this sub."
These people are straight up delusional. The Ben Simmons hate is at such an all time high that they are just making shit up now
"Every time someone brings up fit, it‚Äôs purely anecdotal. Ben and Joel statistically play well when they are both on the court. Is the offense the smoothest? No. But you could argue Embiids weakest offensive skill is playmaking, which is Bens biggest strength. I saw a comment say the 7-1 start was bad for the sixers because it made them keep Simmons. How about we wait more that 8 games to judge how well the team with new players, coaches, and system works out. Or better yet, how about we wait until both players are in their prime? Was Bron the player he is now at 24? Was anyone? Isn‚Äôt there some crazy stat that an extremely high percentage of players on championship rosters are older than 25?"
At least with /r/nba the people that trash ben are fans of other teams. Shits on another level when the Sixers fanbase has circle jerk threads on their subreddit trashing their own players. Cant even make a positive Simmons thread on that subreddit without PMs from 10 year olds telling me to stop sucking ben's dick (I have proof).
I love Ben Simmons and any team would be lucky to have him. He is very good at basketball.
"Genuine question, so after having wall locked up on a 40 mill contract for like 4 more years. What‚Äôs the point of Ben Simmons and his max contract? Is wall going to be their shooting guard? How would they match up?"
"the 76ers can‚Äôt score enough to beat the Nets and their team defense is good but im not betting on Ben Simmons, Thybulle, and Maxey slowing down the Nets 3 All-NBA perimeter players enough"
"Might just have a bit of a grudge on the FO but not the coaching staff or his teammates. If the situation is good enough in Philly, he might be ok staying there. That said, I can only image that a ‚ÄúBen Simmons will remember this‚Äù dialog appeared when Morey was trying to finalise the trade."
"They have zero defense against joel embiid &amp; ben simmons as well though, its an interesting matchup"
Ben Simmons and Gobert would be the worst fit on offense you could make between two all-stars
"I know you follow soccer, so I'll make a cross sport comparison for you:  Ben Simmons is the Bobby Firmino of basketball. He needs his Salah and Mane, 2 high-level shot creators who are going to get you 50+ PPG so Simmons can do all the intangible things that he does at an elite level."
This guy thought he was guarding Ben Simmons
You get to keep Ben Simmons averaging 12/8/8 tho üî•üî•
"I could easily see Dallas taking a chance on him. He'd be a great perimeter defender alongside Luka, and we could have him play the 4. His spacing would hurt us a bit, but we have Porzi≈Üƒ£is and THJ who are great 3PT threats and Luka and Richardson who are capable 3PT shooters.   &amp;#x200B;  C: Kristaps Porzi≈Üƒ£is   PF: Ben Simmons  SF: Tim Hardaway Jr.   SG: Josh Richardson   PG: Luka Donƒçiƒá  I don't know how we would acquire him though. Pick swaps and/or future firsts, and role players? Doesn't seem like it would be enough."
Is simmons value really that low around the league?   I still dont believe the rumors over the summer that there were no takers for myles turner.   But ben simmons not being tradeable (for adequate assets) is a whole other level of absurdity.  I really think this is just spite by a terrible owner
"&gt; considering this might have effects on Simmons' morale.  This is absolutely a concern. Simmons camp told Spears he was ""ecstatic"" to stay in Philly, but that seems like some PR fluff to me. However, he was smiling like a goofball last night during the game which is kind of out of the ordinary for him. [Last night he reiterated how much like he likes playing for Doc](https://sixerswire.usatoday.com/2021/01/14/ben-simmons-appreciates-doc-rivers-honesty-he-keeps-it-real-with-me/amp/).   Guys have held grudges over much less, but as of right now Simmons seems to be OK?  It's certainly a concern though."
If embiid has another 3-4 seasons like he‚Äôs had then he will be in the hall of fame. Ben Simmons maybe if he just racks up all star appearances in the east like Chris bosh did but never was actually superstar
"It‚Äôs a little too early to tell but I do think both players certainly have a shot. Joel is a monster athlete and is having a great season so far, if he manages to take philly to the finals or has any playoff success I think he may have a solid case. That goes for Ben Simmons as well. I do see them both having the stats at the end of their careers to back them up as well."
"Ben Simmons could just take the Dwight Howard path and be a perennial first team all defense and hopefully win a DPOY or two to give him a real at the HoF. JoJo's time might have already passed, to many injuries which has lead him to missing way to many games."
I remember when Simmons was being torn apart by this sub for not showing up to his college classes leading up to the 2016 draft.  then he was being torn apart by a lot of people on here because apparently he shouldn't be eligible for ROTY.  then there was a small grace period and now the majority of people hate him again because he won't shoot... AND HE DOESN'T EVEN PLAY FOR 99% OF YALLS TEAM.  like why are some dudes begging for Simmons to develop a jumpshot? he aint gonna be winning for your team. if the Sixers start winning chips (because Ben Simmons developed a jumpshot...?) everybody is gonna be shittin on Simmons again for some whole ass other reason.  dude just commands hate from bums who got nothing better to do
"I think ""horrible"" fit wildly overstates things offensively and understates what the impact would be defensively.  Passing compounds passing. It's a beautiful thing to have multiple great passers, jokic can shoot, as can multiple other pieces on that team, i dunno what the problem would be.   denver's issue isn't ""how do we get jokic the ball more"", it's ""how the fuck are we gonna stop anyone"".  So you take some assist usage off jokic individually, but in return imagine the compounding effect of simmons and jokic's assist usage combined, *and* how dangerous that team is in a series with Ben being a defensive joker for the matchup chess.  Benefits would far outweigh the flaws.  Plus just woulda been fun to see the sorta ball movement that created."
"He may never become a superstar, but as he is right now is pretty fucking good. I would still trade him for James, but im not trading him and 19 1st round picks which is what the nets did. So maybe the rockets are who stopped the trade?    I think the key is seeing what they do with oladipo. If they don't re-sign him, then they were probably just looking for less salary. In that case, Ben is the wrong person since his extension will be coming up.    Idk why yall hate on Ben simmons. He is nice af"
"Houston got 8 picks from the Nets. The question is can you draft the next Ben Simmons or better with 8 picks. The current Simmons? Probably. A Simmons that grows a pair and shoots past 10 feet, probably not. But who knows if he ever gets there."
"Really? He‚Äôs been great? It‚Äôs funny how people always rush to talk about how great Draymond is even when his numbers are absolute ass, yet everyone shits on Ben Simmons. If Draymond is great I guess Simmons is the next MJ."
"He‚Äôs a hair too old to be young and just on the wrong side of being a star.  Ben Simmons, a year younger and a bit more proven, is the lower limit for both young and a star imo."
"Outside of flipping Kyrie for other assets, was getting Irving really in the Rockets best interest anyway?  Kyrie + Wood is not going to win you anything even if he was motivated to play with the Rockets.  You weren't going to get the same collection of picks if you took Kyrie so I think they probably did about as well as they could in this trade scenario.  I think I still would have taken a package around Ben Simmons (depending on what the rest of the return was) but Oladipo + depth + a million first round picks seems about as good as you are going to get."
I hate Simmons more than most people but it‚Äôs much more likely that the pick turns into a bust than someone better than Ben.
Eh it's a pretty deep draft but there really isn't anyone putting up numbers like Luka Doncic or Ja Morant or Ben Simmons or KAT so far.   Out of the past 5 years I think this is probably the 2nd weakest top end behind 2016-17. That said I think some guys like Wiseman and Deni play a type of game that will look a lot better when they're a few years older.
"I don't know how to explain this clearer. The Houston Rockets with Ben Simmons were not winning anything. We're not in a good situation financially or roster-wise to start building around Simmons right now.  It's like a sword got pulled out of our chest, and you're telling us we should have gotten a bigger bandaid, but we're already at the hospital."
"Utah Jazz for sure. We have the league's most sympathetic and likable player, Joe Ingles. Really funny guy, you just can't hate on him. We have Donovan Mitchell, best player of his class (2017). He would have got Rookie Of The Year award but he got robbed by Ben Simmons. I don't wanna get into that, complex situation. Anyways we have Rudy Gobert, good ol French guy, best defencer in the league. He got 2 back to back Defensive Player Of The Year. And we have a really good chance to be champion this year."
"Fuckers in school telling me, always in the barbershop. Markelle Fultz can‚Äôt shoot 3s, Markelle Fultz fucked his free throw. My boy weak, he got the yips or something. He, he say that boy ain‚Äôt been putting in work. SHUT THE FUCK UP! Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt know shit! All ya motherfuckers talk about Fultz ain‚Äôt no hitter, Fultz a bust, Fultz a fake SHUT THE FUCK UP! Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt live with that boy! You know that boy got shout-out from KD, shooting hesi pull ups and shit. Kelle been pullin up since fucking.... I don‚Äôt know when. Motherfuckers stop fucking playin him like that. Them boys ballin out here. If I catch another Tatum or Big Baller Ass motherfucker talking sweet about ‚ÄòKelle I‚Äôm fuckin beating they ass! I‚Äôm not fucking playing no more, you know those boys roll with Ben Simmons and them!"
and if his name wasn't Ben Simmons that would've been an and 1 opportunity!
Aye lemme see that Ben Simmons career 3pt%
Ben Simmons just guarded every pacers player over the course of a quarter
"Rudy Gobert, Myles Turner, Lu Dort, Jrue Holiday, Ben Simmons"
Lowry has challenged Ben Simmons to a fight in the fucking tunnel lol. He isn‚Äôt scared of Gordon
Posting a Ben Simmons highlight that isn't a three\*
Posting a Ben Simmons highlight on r/nba? You‚Äôre a brave person
Ben Simmons picks either 3 minute stretches or entire games for when he scores 8 points. Turn the tv off for 2 min and he went from 4 to 12
Nice picture of Ben Simmons to compliment the post.
You think either Ben Simmons or 0 pacers will make an all star team?
"I'm looking at Embiid's shot chart from last year, [and he was not an efficient mid-range shooter at all.](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=joel+embiid+shot+chart+2019-2020) I can't find stats for this year, so maybe that's changed? It's pretty silly to say that steals don't correlate well with defense. It's always been one of the most important factors in consideration for the DPOY and the league leader in steals wins it pretty often.  If Embiid runs the offense, what the hell is Ben Simmons for?"
*uncomfortable ben simmons noises*
Except Waters isn't a scoring PG?  He broke Ben Simmons' LSU freshman assist record and he was SEC defensive player of the year.
"For his career I've compared Jokic to Ben Simmons on offense. I know that's gonna cause some alarm but stay with me here. *Before this season* people said he was better at offense than Embiid, but I legitimately couldn't see why. For his career to that point he scored slightly better than Simmons and assisted a little worse than Simmons. So I thought his offensive impact was about that level (which is really fucking high btw, it's just no one seems to care about points generated through assists when discussing Ben for some reason).   *This* season he is scoring *significantly higher* than his previous career high of 20ppg and he's raised his assists numbers up higher too. I think this version of Jokic is as impactful if not more than Joel Embiid and much more impactful than Simmons if he keeps up this torrid pace.   My only thing that I would say is people are acting like he was always this guy and her just was not. He was amazing, but this year he has taken a quantum leap in his scoring ability. Nuggets fans would always talk about his percentages like he could drop 25 a night if he decided too. My counter was that if he could he would. If Seth Curry could take as many threes as Steph Curry and keep his percentages he would. But this year not only is he scoring more he's doing so with greater efficiency and even more offensive responsibility."
Ask Ben Simmons which one is harder lol
Kinda similar to how Ben Simmons was in college. Just didn't give af
"I think a guy like Ben Simmons would be perfect for the Cs. Obviously he‚Äôs 1 in a million but we don‚Äôt need another guy looking to score. We need someone that can facilitate, rebound, and -most importantly-switch on D. Kemba is going to get hunted in every game."
"Steph's 30/5/6 is pretty reliable, although you'd probably only call it a ""Steph Curry"" if it comes on 45% or better from 3. Ben Simmons has been a pretty consistent 16/8/8 since he came into the league, although his scoring's down this year."
This post makes no sense. Philly has one of the best play making point guards in the league in Ben Simmons. Stop trying to make excuses for embiid.
"Ben Simmons: ""Wait, he beat you?"""
Ben Simmons.   This should end it.
Ben Simmons 0/0
"I guess that works, but Ben Simmons himself has averaged more than that. 15/7/7 is his statline I think"
Ben Simmons 12/8/8?
He‚Äôs everything Ben Simmons wished he was
"Well he is a bad defender. There‚Äôs a reason his teams get destroyed in the playoffs every year: they don‚Äôt play defense. He‚Äôs not an elite defender and his teams resemble that. Portland got absolutely destroyed by LA last year for that reason. Basketball isn‚Äôt all about scoring. There‚Äôs a reason kawhi, KD, Lebron are champions. Their teams play really good defense. I‚Äôd take ben Simmons or jalen brown any day over dame lillard for that exact reason. Guarantee they get bounced in the first round again but he will hit some 3s and everyone will think he‚Äôs an elite player in this league"
"When I say ""relatively accurate from range"" i mean you need to guard him at the perimeter because they won't reliably miss. I stopped explaining their tools because the reply is getting long. Base reasoning below.   TLDR In no order: Harden (step back foul draw, relatively accurate, big enough to drive through matchups he can't shake off), KD (Dirk fadeaway is pretty hard to guard, accurate from range, big enough to bully through a lot of matchups), Dame (accurate from range, slightly better handles than steph lets him shake off more defenders, more willing? to drive through dame is probably 10th or out of the list), Kyrie (relatively accurate from range, probably the best handles in the league), Kawhi, Tatum, Jokic, Lebron, Jokic, Luka, AD.   Hmmm so, first of all I think we agree KD is a top ISO player right? even though the stat for 2015-16 disagree. That shows we kind of need to develop some standard for how we measure iso in addition to pure stats. Eye tests are generally biased, but we can get somewhat close to relatively fair. For ISO to work well, you need to be able to consistently beat out a player 1v1. Thats predicated on you having many different ways to score, generally also involving elite handling. Being elite at just one thing makes you predictable, and predictability can often times be exploited as a weakness (Ben Simmons on offense). Curry doesn't really have the size to threaten a drive through by force consistently--his main weapon is how far away he can make a three. That means that even Kevin Love can guard curry because he knows curry will 80% of the time pass or shoot if he isn't receiving the ball already in the paint (which, thats not really shooting shooting). If curry were simmons sized, he'd probably average 40 a night as an illustration of what I mean. Every player I list has the ability to score in more than 2 ways or have the handles to shake off most defenders."
Are you forgetting about Ben Simmons?
"&gt; What injuries have slowed Simmons down this season?  He is clearly still bothered by his knee, he sat out a couple of games with swelling in that same knee earlier in the season. You don't have to be Einstein to figure out the knee was limiting him on the court but also it is clear by watching him, and many others noted this in the Sixers sub, that he was favouring the leg, not being nearly as explosive nor jumping up for blocks/rebounds in situations he would normally do that kind of thing.            Even if you put his injury aside, the Sixers have been transformed into a new team in terms of the coaching staff and their FO. The way Doc is utilising Ben is not the same as the way Brett Brown did. Doc has openly stated he doesn't care about his scoring that he's using him as a playmaker, likely understanding that to be a number two guy in terms of scoring that you have to be an all court scorer - post ups, mid range, threes. Ben isn't close to this kind of scorer right now but that doesn't concern Doc because he's also got a rejuvenated Tobias (47% from 3), a highly efficient perimeter scorer in Seth Curry (52% from 3) and a dynamic bench scorer in Shake Milton to support the main guy in Joel. Ben is essentially the number five scoring option on that team, he is the quintessential glue guy. Draymond was this player in 2015 and 2016 and was arguably the second most important player for the Warriors in this period. He doesn't have to score, he's the one setting guys up with his gravity on drives, defenses collapse on him and he routinely dishes out to wide open three point shooters. It's why he's one of the league leaders in assists that lead to three point field goals. He is at career lows in field goal attempts so this backs up that theory.                   &gt; Isn't something I've heard.                   Go to the Sixers sub whenever Ben has a bad game, you'll hear it plenty..."
Ok you‚Äôre trolling right? You have Ben Simmons on your team. Did I just fall for bait?
"I like civil debates. My goal isn't to make this incendiary but its late where I am so if my wording makes it incendiary I apologize.    ""not based on any type of fact""  Lets look at his most commonly praised skills: 3pt shooting, and offball movement. Tell me what good is creating open looks for teammates who can't shoot, or tell me what good being open to receive passes does if your teammates aren't good passers and opt to take the shot instead? He isn't a top 10 iso player, he isn't someone who is known for driving by defenders by force, and he isn't the passing god like CP3, Draymond, or even Lebron are. He isn't a BAD passer, but thats not what puts him in the MVP tier.   ""In the case of 2012-2013 or 2013-2014, this was when Steph legitimately led teams to the playoffs when his best teammate was David Lee.""  Well first of all he had Klay, so idk about it being a solo carry job--also bogut was there, at least for half the season. I mean, Klay and Lee at least can use steph's spacing no? Green wasn't good until he utilized properly, but Klay was never bad.   ""But moreso than that, Steph became the engine of the team, and thus it was hard to separate his success from his team's success.""  Green is the engine. Green is the floor general that leads Kerr's motion offense. Sure Klay and Curry being historic shooters help, but motion is a high IQ system and I don't think many people would disagree if I said Green is the highest IQ warriors player. I mean regardless motion offense is a team effort, not a solo effort; thats why the most famous motion offenses are all borderline super-teams/super teams (2014 Spurs, MVP season Curry). But maybe we just define engine differently. Maybe my definition is wrong, but semantics aside, Curry isn't the sole reason Kerr's offense works.   ""Everyone always tries to discredit the fact that Steph is the reason his teams are so good, and instead rely on the idea that he's great or has major success because of his teams. ""  Not my argument. My argument is that one of steph's greatest and rarest strengths is that he makes an offense better just by existing. He isn't an iso player, he isn't a Magic Johnson type passer, he isn't a bully in the paint player. I can't think of any player in history that has steph's skillset and comparing him to Dame, Kyrie, Harden, any other guard, is ignoring half his strengths.   ""If Dame was on this exact same team, I don't think that they have a better record.""  I picked out those three because they're selfish Iso players who don't necessarily ""want"" help. Look at some of the bad games the warriors have had. Its usually because steph's teammates can't take advantage of his gravity and brick very open 3s. Defenses leave oubre and Green open until they drive and instead triple team curry because...well why bother guarding them? Dame doesn't have nearly the same off-ball movement Steph does, but he is better at iso, and is better at playing hero ball. Same with Harden--I mean his MVP caliber seasons have been him playing one man offense (I know he had help but he isn't the passing magician or an off-ball god he isos and step-back 3s). These selfish players have an easier time dismantling bad teams, but against more sophisticated defenses, they hit a brick wall. Look at the Bucks last year: they had one of the easiest offenses to ""figure"" out and got knocked out fast. Look at the Lakers in comparison: they have one of the best passers on the main unit, and a historically great passer off the bench.   ""So there's an example of his floor raising happening right now.""  Green is also back, Wiseman is an addition whether as a starter (debatable) or off the bench. Paschall had a year to grow and is better now than he was last year. Oubre isn't the player we hoped for, but he is at the very least a positive addition from last year. Wiggins had time to gel with the Warriors (we played most of it with DLo last year). Wasn't Looney also injured last year? I think this year's team, even without curry, is a lot better than last year's team, so I'm not sure this is the best example.   ""He is simply much more talented than every other point guard""  Overall? Sure. He isn't better at iso than the guard I listed. He can't be a force in the paint compared with plenty of bigger guards (I mean he's NBA-short at 6'3)  ""To say he isn't a floor raiser is relying on lazy narrative as opposed to watching the actual games."" I watch most if not all their games.  ""The reason he has a better iso game is because he's a significantly better shooter than all of the aforementioned players outside of KD""/Iso talk  Well first of all I wouldn't say significantly. I dislike Kyrie too but he still is an all-star caliber player lets not go too far.  Second, being good at iso means you can....well isolate a match up and create on your own. That comes from Kyrie like handles, or having multiple different ways to score whether thats shooting accuracy, or driving to the basket, etc. I mean think about Ben Simmons. He has the physical tools to drive to the paint, but because his offensive skillset is very limited (no shooting), he is hampered on offense. Not trying to compare the two just using Ben to illustrate the idea of how a ""limited"" skillset hampers offense. Also not trying to say steph is that limited, but he doesn't have the size to bully through defenders (like, say, Kobe, could). Also not trying to start the dame vs curry debate because they're very different players and a comparison is very context dependent.   ""This is an example of glorifying one on one basketball when it doesn't have a significant baring on the success of a team.""  Nope. That would imply my argument were ""Iso means you're better"" which it wasn't. Iso is definitely a part of basketball, and its one where curry isn't a goat in. Also, Kobe was an Iso-god, and he contributed to team success. Harden is an iso player and he led the rockets to conference finals, only losing to a historic team.   ""The people who repeated the narrative that Steph couldn't carry the team are the same people that don't understand what makes him so great, yeah.""  Well i'm saying he isn't a floor raiser while at the same time saying that its because his gravity is a solid part of why he's an all time great with the likes of the ""not quite Lebron or MJ"" tier players. I mean, if I had to do an all time PG ranking, he'd be easily ahead of Kyrie and Dame. Thats, however, not because he can take a 5 win team and make them a playoff team (I mean again if you surround him with 30% shooters, why would teams NOT triple team him? He can run off ball all he wants if his teammates are too low IQ/skill to take advantage of it. ). Thats because he can take a 40 win team and make them a title contender. Put curry on the, say, wizards, and all that means is teams box1 and hound curry. He either shoots with multiple defenders in his face or passes to a teammate who probably bricks a shot. Off ball, he can run around all he wants. He can disrupt the opponent's defense all he wants but if nobody passes to him  or his teammates can't make easy shots, then what does that even do?"
"Lmao he got swept in the finals. Hes not on the level of KD, Steph, Harden, Embiid, Jokic, LeBron, AD, probably more I'm  missing. He hasnt made a 3 in 7 games this season, fucking Ben Simmons has more 3s than him"
Ben Simmons would _never_ lose to Kemba
Oh good another Ben Simmons hate thread.
Ben Simmons is another one who can bother him also.
"Lol you're so salty dude, why you followin me everywhere bringin ben simmons up in threads that got nothing to do with him."
If my life was on the line I‚Äôd choose Ben Simmons
"Look at Ben Simmons, Magic Johnson or to an ever reaching extent, James Wiseman (if he ever goes the finesse center route and not the rim racking explosive route) When you tall, your court vision is exceptional and when you can make the right pass, you can exploit a lot of crevices the normal point guard may not see."
"on another note, at what age was Ben Simmons a better shooter than Ben Simmons is today?"
reddit told me luka is ben simmons from beyond the arc  i've been bamboozled
"Compared to me, Ben Simmons is a great three-point shooter."
Ben Simmons. Jokic at his best is with shooters. Jokic just like Embiid plays a lot better with shooter. Contributing to Jokic passing ability and Embiid's ability to draw doubles
"Shumpert isn't a Ben Simmons type shooter plus he's not looking to shoot or do anything on offense anyways, we got plenty of that. Same for Pelle, we have the best shooting team and plenty of spacing plus they won't be rotational pieces in the end game. And since they won't be looking for much on offense they have more energy on D which is why they were signed."
Downvoting this comment is easier than guarding Ben Simmons
not a good sign if you're comparing his shooting to Ginannis and ben simmons
Yeah you do. Who is going to pay attention to someone that's not a threat? Just look at Ben Simmons outside the paint. As long as he's out there no one cares and they give all the room in the world to shoot that brick comfortably.  You need guys that are some kind of threat to keep defenses honest.
"You haven‚Äôt watched him then. He worse than cov, and cov isn‚Äôt close to a guy like klay or Ben simmons. He‚Äôs just fine."
the holy duo of dudes that /r/nba loves to shit on: Ben Simmons and Russell Westbrook
I'm not as impressed by these stats because Zion's first 40 games have come over 2 years lol it's like the Ben Simmons rookie meme all over again.
"You could do that, but Lukas shooting mentality is closer to JR Smiths than to Ben simmons. Case in point the buzzer beater over the clippers in the bubble.   People respect his shot not bc he‚Äôs a good shooter, but bc he has elite confidence in himself and has proven he can make it when it matters"
"I think you're still exaggerating the gap between the US and the rest of the world in the sport of basketball. This isn't American pigskin football. Basketball is about as accessible as soccer, a ball and two goals. People have been playing it globally for decades. There is nothing special about American bodies. The talent and athleticism is there and beginning to dominate NBA basketball. Giannis, Luka, Embiid, Jokic are MVP players, Gobert is 3x DPOY, Siakim MIP, Ben Simmons might be the best player in basketball if he could shoot well, and that scratches the surface. The institutions needed to cultivate basketball skill have been developing across every continent for the past 20 or so years. We lost in 2004, we lost in 2019, we'll lose in the future, and every time there will be excuses. We continue to imagine American teams daddying Euro teams even though Doncic came over and dad dicked the whole NBA at age 19. I'm not anti-nationalism or anything; I merely think the idea of American supremacy of basketball that fans still hold on to is becoming more and more inaccurate and will soon become deluded."
"Top 10 !?! Right now ? Uh lets see Curry, Dame, kyrie , cp3, john wall , ben simmons , trae young , ja morant, deaaron fox , kemba, jamal murray are all better rn"
Zion and ben simmons punching the air rn while blake griffin cries in the corner
Ben Simmons is neither ball dominant nor a guard.
Ben Simmons would like a word
Yeah. I think certain guys could be like him though. If Giannis and Simmons basically just became draymond they could lead teams to championships. They have the defence and playmaking and are much better around the rim. They really need to just be the centres (obviously you guys have embiid so it doesn't really work with Ben but you could play him like that when embiid is off the floor.
"The sixers are so unique in this small ball era, basically the equivalent of a power run team.  A lot of their games end up being close because Embiids presence dictates the flow of the game on both sides of the ball which imo is a good thing for the sixers.  Eventually once the other teams center and backup center are in foul trouble they seem to run away with games in the 3rd quarter, a stark contrast from Brett browns 3rd quarter disaster.    The offense is really really simplistic, with teams having to pick between leaving embiid 1 on 1 and getting brutalized down low, or Ben assisting or hockey assisting on a 4v3 if they double.  Speaking of that the offensive design is fantastic, in that they have maximized Bens strengths (rebounding, reading the defense, transition) while building a half court offense that is completely unreliant on Bens scoring to be successful.  Defensively tobias‚Äô improvement has been a very big upgrade, and Embiid and Simmons continue to be the best defensive tandem in the league.  Sixers‚Äô identity is simple, back you down and physically impose their will on offense, and force tough looks defensively with their length and two all NBA defenders.  No reason this team can‚Äôt finish with the one seed."
&gt;Ben and embiid know how to play better now   It‚Äôs regular season. Until Simmons actually learns to shoot the problems didn‚Äôt magically go away. Teams know to clog the paint and passing lanes and give simmions space up top. If simmions is unwilling to take those open threes and deep midrange shots it‚Äôll be the exact same results as the past 3 years.
"I didn't downvote you, i rarely vote either way. Ben and Embiid know how to play better now. Notice nobody ever doubles Embiid off of Simmons? The double comes from the 3 point line every time."
"The nets defense is horrible, I agree they‚Äôll get knocked out, but you‚Äôll change your opinion when once again Ben Simmons is stuck in the dunker spot every 4th quarter and you guys missed out on an actual chance to contend.  Downvote all you want but your front office failed spectacularly by not acquiring harden"
HOLD THE LINE. TRUST THE PROCESS. NO NOT FUCKING SELL BEN SIMMONS. LEBRON IS A üåà üêª
"So because they said no to Simmons, Maxey, and 3 firsts, you took that as them refusing to trade Ben? The holdup was giving up more than what was needed. And instead of negotiating, they took the Nets offer."
Ok so why wouldnt they now negotiate a deal for Beal using Simmons again? Im not saying they are calling every team in the league offering Simmons but if the right deals is on the table Ben Simmons aint off limits
"If Ben Simmons is on the trading block for Beal there is no way the Mavs have enough to land him, unless they trade Luka -Depressed Mavs fan."

"When Simmons blow by someone to the hoop and forced centre come up to defend him. Ben will just passing it to Embiid, it's unstoppable and easy 2 points. Not only Joel and Ben, Harris has been playing well. Any team that try to defend Joel + Ben + Harris, it's often too much for teams because they are all 6'10+ players in a different position. Sixers will abuse on any mismatches, Harris vs Caruso on last play is the example for this."
"If only Luka would stop taking so many 3s, and played elite defense.   He'd almost be as good as Ben Simmons."
Who is better than Ben Simmons this year
"The NBA‚Äôs rookie rules are so dumb, if you apply baseball or hockey rookie rules to basketball (basically both require that a player can‚Äôt have more than ~1/4 of big league experience from the previous season, though it‚Äôs def more complicated than that), Keldon should 100% be considered a rookie this season.   You‚Äôre telling me that Julius Randle, who got injured in his first 12 minutes of game time and missed the rest of his first year, isn‚Äôt a rookie anymore but Blake Griffin and Ben Simmons are? Some whack ass shit."
Ben Simmons does it all the time. Players gotta watch out for this
LSU: Ben Simmons
Disagree. Give me DeMar over both Tobi and Ben any day. Also Keldon is a way better Prospect than Simmons as well.
Your 2nd best player is Ben Simmons LMAO
"Tbf he wanted nothing to do with Ben Simmons, then when he got switched onto korkmaz he would just shoot silly contested threes.  That all star appearance really inflated DLOs value as a player"
"i got nothing bad to say about the Sixers cos I think they're a dope team and I love Ben Simmons but keep talking ya shit, we've heard it all before"
So is Ben Simmons not gonna make it this year? I haven‚Äôt looked at his numbers but I usually thought he was a lock
"Even when he misses, I wanna see him make more than Ben Simmons"
Jrich looked better on defense with Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid on his team.
Embiid shoots 32% from 3  Should we even talk about Ben Simmons?
The ol Ben Simmons
"Unlike Ben Simmons, Zion is elite at attacking the rim and getting what he wants there, and he‚Äôs not afraid to take 1-2 a game. He could also expand to the mid range but he hasn‚Äôt shown that he‚Äôs gonna pass the shots up."
Michael Jordan is just DeMar DeRozan  Magic Johnson is just flashy Ben Simmons    you dont have to disrespect legends to make todays game look better. get outta here lmao
LeBron is just Ben Simmons if Simmons didn't selflessly pass up shots.
Ben Simmons is just a flashier Lonzo
Ben Simmons currently has -2 points in fantasy for me I can't believe anyone ever thought they could get Harden for this scrub /s
You might get Ben Simmons thrown at you too.
"If the Sixers stay #1 seed, I dont see how Ben Simmons doesnt make it."
"Westbrook, Giannis, Ben Simmons"
"""Ben Simmons is 100% from 3 when he makes them!"" 5 game sample size? Then you remove all of his bad performances. ""Look he's nuts when you factor out all of his subpar games!""  I mean good luck to him and the Pistons but this is a lame ass post that I can only hope is ironic but knowing r/nba..."
"Imagine Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Danny Green, Dwight Howard, and Joel Embiid.  Fuck..."
"Three huge differences: the rockets and harden relationship was publically toxic, Brooklyn flipped unprotected picks that will likely be extremely valuable with all their stars into their 30s, besides kyrie (vs your offer where Memphis is virtually guaranteed to be in the playoffs throughout the 7 seasons you are allowed to trade picks for), AND Tillman Frittata refused to take the better offer of Ben simmons who was on the table, because he's a fuckstick.  The wizards have a good relationship, beal is not harden, the picks available from Memphis are nowhere near as valuable potentially, and I just think yer full stop wrong that teams won't flip young talent for beal.  I dont want the dubs flipping wiseman for him, and I don't think they will, but you absolutely have the convo.  &gt;Jalen Green, Zaire Williams, Chet Holmgen, Patrick Baldwin, Emoni Bates, etc.  Re-sign beal and you can pair any of these guys with him to begin with..."
"Yeah that‚Äôs a homer take, there is still a buyout market and plenty of time to make trades for defenders. You have a team with 3 dudes who can drop 35+ ppg at will during the playoffs vs teams who can‚Äôt. Sixers and bucks get into a scoring match I don‚Äôt see how Ben Simmons can adjust and I don‚Äôt see how the bud can adapt."
Pretty sure Herro is better than Ben simmons bum 12 ppg ass.
"Sixers get 2011 Dwight , 2014 Danny Green, and rookie Ben Simmons"
Ben Simmons
beal for ben simmons
Ben Simmons seems like the obvious choice. Has so much raw talent but his game hasn‚Äôt progressed much since he came into the league. He could be a top 10 player in the league with a passable jumpshot.
Anyone in here tryna say this is what Ben Simmons does can gtfoh. Ben legitimately just misses sometimes /s
"Tobias Harris has taken more shots than Ben Simmons in every game theybe both played this season, you're not even trying to pretend like you're making a real argument right now.  E: Hell Simmons' season high is 15 shots, that's lower than Harris' per game average for the year"
"That‚Äôs your perspective, but the ben Simmons / 3 pointer saga is one of those things where people love to point and laugh to feel better about themselves... media fuels it.  Reality is Simmons is an elite defender and already a top 30 guy based on his current skill-set... my point is there is a disproportionate hate to Simmons because of our current obsession with the 3 ball. Reminds me of how people would shit on fultz when he got the yips and couldn‚Äôt shoot FTs... makes for good tv."
"Dame.  For a lot of our fanbase CJ + whatever for Ben Simmons is the dream trade.    Dame + Gary + Ben Simmons + Roco + Nurk   Not only solves a lot of our defensive problems, but also gives us someone that can actually playmake when dame inevitably gets doubled.  Never gonna happen, but would be really sick if it did"
Ben simmons is not an all star this year lol yeah his defense is great but his numbers are average
Vuc and Ben Simmons to me are the two WC spot.  I know they have better teams but I don't think All Star is necessarily about that.
"im not even old, people like you are just salty its true. lol players are stronger? ok bud. none of them are stronger than Shaq/Malone/Robinson..you have college dudes coming in who are soft as hell. lmao Scottie Pippen would be a better version of Ben Simmons in todays game...legit bum ass Andre Roberson has a job when he cant shoot for anything"
Not able to when Ben Simmons is still playing.
"Ben Simmons is not a superstar.. he‚Äôs not even close to one. What kind of stupid juice are you on? He‚Äôs not even a top 5 player and you think he‚Äôs a superstar?? He‚Äôs not even the best player on his team.  And tell me.. how many finals has Giannis been too with that blueprint?  Because last I remember they pack the paint and dare him to shoot. Hence why his teams always ‚Äúchoke‚Äù in the playoffs.  News Flash: your inability to shoot gets exposed in the playoffs, and if you cannot shoot you won‚Äôt lead your team to a championship in the modern NBA. Just how it is.   And we will lmao. Because that‚Äôs the right way to land a superstar. Either trade for one or tank and draft one. I will never understand why people overrate Ben Simmons the way they do."
unless he's guarded by Ben Simmons ;)
Ben Simmons Easily
Giannis and Lebron are the two greatest slashers of the past 20 years and there's really no debate. Wade probably isn't even better at slashing than Ben Simmons
"I get the logic, but I think the only reason it works is because the Wolves are bad. I feel really strongly that if KAT had a better team around him, more people would realize how valuable a guy like him is on offense. First of all, KAT doesn't primarily shoot 3s. 2019 was the only year in his career where he has attempted more than 5 threes a game. His scoring breakdown is like 4-5ppg from free throws, 12-14ppg from less than 10 feet, and then the rest (5-7ppg) from jump shots.  Now, you could still definitely counter with the point that KAT still spends a lot of his time on the perimeter, because a lot of his scoring in the paint comes from drives. But I still don't buy the argument that its a bad thing.  1. Foul drawing. KAT is still top 20 every year in FTA  2. Pretty much everyone has recognized now that post scoring is one of the least efficient ways to score. Guys like Vernon Carey from Duke drop to the second round of the draft even though he was dominant as an 18 year old, because he does most of his scoring in the post (and wasn't a great defender). It's just not as valuable as having a guy that can shoot the 3. Joel Embiid is the exception to the rule. He is perhaps the most dominant post scorer of the last 10 years and so he gets the big green light. But the jury is still somewhat out on how much value his post scoring actually provides because he has had way more talent around him than KAT and the 76ers still haven't really done anything. Now it's not his fault that his playstyle clashes with Ben Simmons a little bit, and they would probably be better on offense with more of a shooter like Mitchell or Booker, etc. but I also think its likely that Ben Simmons looks way better next to KAT's spacing.  3. Your and Chuck's argument just completely ignore the effect that a shooting big has on the defense. It pulls the opponent's rim protector away from the rim and makes it so much easier to drive to the rim, move off ball, etc.  4. I will give you that it does mean you are getting fewer offensive rebounds, but I will trade that any day for opening up the paint more. There are a lot of coaches these days that tell players not to hunt for offensive rebounds anyway because if you don't get it the opposing team has the advantage. KAT at the 3p line means he can be one of the first back and slow down fast breaks."
Those are some Ben Simmons numbers right there.... Almost lol üòÜ
Ben Simmons is a top 5 passer y‚Äôall are wild
Ben Simmons IMO.
"Ben Simmons is a great passer and a great player, a better player then LaMelo as of now. But LaMelo is a better passer, and impacts the game much more through his passing, but not nearly as much defensively"
Ben Simmons obviously
"Ben simmons is averaging 8 assists per game for the past 3 years, what makes lamelo better than him? We havent even see lamelo do anything crazy"
Better passer? 100% LaMelo. Better players 100% Ben Simmons
"Ben Simmons is a freaky athlete man, dude is like 6'10 yet moves like a fast guard, crazy shit."
Nice enough of Ben Simmons to take time out of his schedule to make the rap intro.
"Shake was included in the deal, to be fair.  But ya, they would have been farther ahead. I do understand their perspective in the sense that they would have had to give up as many first rounders as the other teams, two both of their young guys with any potential(Shake and Maxsey), and yet Ben Simmons is far and away better than any other player included in any other team's package. He alone is better and worth more than every other team's player package. I know it's easy to say ""Morey should have gone all in!"" but it may very well still work out for them anyway in the long run if their young guys develop.   None of this is to say Harden isn't worth everything, it's just that Morey probably didn't want to get ripped off completely when other team's had worse competing offers."
"Lebron is a good 3pt shooter, idk why you‚Äôre cherry picking his last 8 games. He‚Äôs career 35% from 3 shooting mostly off the dribble which is good (not great). If Giannis and Ben Simmons shot 35% from 3, everyone would have a boner. And I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs obvious he‚Äôs joking. Half these comments don‚Äôt seem to realize he missed"
"Who do we think has the best chance to do it that‚Äôs active right now?   Personally I‚Äôd think Ben Simmons. Obviously the tough part is somebody who could get 10 steals or blocks. Don‚Äôt see anybody who could get 10 blocks that would be able to get 10 assists. Ben Simmons I could see him getting 10 steals , just harassing a terrible point guard one game. And the assists and rebounds part is very attainable for him"
Ben Simmons is good again
Christian Wood is 25 and you don't have your own pick next year.  How many years are you going to be waiting to surround him?  Meanwhile Ben Simmons is a top player who's game not only meshes well with Woods but is also similar age wise.
The way this Nets experiment is shaking out it would be a big surprise if they didn't all re-sign. There's maybe 2 possible 3 valuable picks/swaps out of the collection. I respect that people think Ben couldn't develop in to a cornerstone but I think the Rockets would have been better taking Simmons/Thybulle or Maxey/ + 2-3 FRPs. Long way to go though
I mean Ben Simmons was publicly on the table in a Harden trade. Didn‚Äôt really seem to rock the boat...
"I'm not high on Thybulle, and Rocket fans aren't very high on Ben Simmons as a cornerstone player. In Houston he wouldn't be paired with an Embiid-like talent. I believe Morey was offering two picks and we never found out what the protections were on them. With Brooklyn, the Rockets receive a haul of unprotected 1sts and swaps, some of which will convey long after the Big 3 complete their primes. They could be extremely valuable."
Soo you would rather have Ben Simmons (16/8/8) over players like Kobe/Curry even Lillard (25/5/4 &amp; 23/5/6) etc (based on their career stat-lines). Cuz that's simply ridiculous.   People waay too overrate counting stats.
"76ers would have been clearly best in the East if they traded but even without the trade they're still favorites for best in the East. Also probably wouldn't be able to handle the loss of depth as well as the team with 3 top 10/15 level players can. Ben and Maxey together is probably the best defensive backcourt combination. And I think he just wasn't headed to Philly. Simmons alone beats out the Nets offer if he was truly in the package.  Heat on the otherhand aren't looking great without the trade. And it's worse when they were only giving up herro and Robinson essentiall. Harden, Jimmy, and bam though is a lot of talent im surprised they passed on."
How was it worse when we got more picks?  The Philly deal was centered around Ben Simmons. We didn‚Äôt want Ben Simmons because he‚Äôs limited offensively. Rather go full rebuild and try to one a superstar to pair with Wood.
Idk if I‚Äôd blame the other east teams when Philly offered Ben Simmons.
"&gt;Though their defense is solid against most teams, superstars usually go off against them, especially big guys. If Ben Simmons did that, what would Bron do?  I'm not sure that's totally fair. Simmons was carrying Embid's load and had ROTY vendetta energy. Plus the Jazz didn't gameplan against him at center. The seconds half he shot much worse after adjustments.  Jazz defended Giannis, Butler and Tatam extremely well in the previous three games."
"It's been fun, but I still see major flaws that might become more glaring in the Playoffs:  1) Though their defense is solid against most teams, superstars usually go off against them, especially big guys. If Ben Simmons did that, what would Bron do?  2) Donovan Mitchell has been too inconsistent this season. They need last year's playoff Donovan Mitchell to really be legit in the postseason, and I'm not seeing it so far.   Plus, Bogi has been uber-inconsistent this season as well. I imagine that teams like the Lakers and Clippers will hunt Clarkson on defense, so they're going to need their main stars to show up on a consistent basis."
"Ah yes, I forgot Ben Simmons doesn‚Äôt have a position"
Ben Simmons vs Jazz record career threes
"I'm not sure when that pic is from or if there's something going on with depth perception, but here's him standing next to LeBron and is [clearly taller.](https://www.libertyballers.com/2016/8/31/12734146/ben-simmons-workout-lebron-james-dwyane-wade-offseason-nba-draft) here's him next to [embiid as well who is legit 7ft without shoes.](https://www.detroitbadboys.com/2017/10/12/16459648/nba-playoff-contenders-philadelphia-poised-to-finally-compete-joel-embiid-ben-simmons)"
Ben Simmons with his own team would be like this. Unlocked.
"Jesus, you're right. Wikipedia has Ben Simmons listed at 6'11"". How is that accurate? He's taller than Lebron (6'9"")?"
"This was a thrilling game. Ben Simmons had a career high 42 points. Jordan Clarkson had a season high 40 points. Tobias Harris had a season high 36 points. Both teams were shooting lights out and it was some good basketball.  Ben Simmons is pretty unstoppable when he‚Äôs driving to the basket. With Embiid out for the game, that opened up the paint for Ben to drive more. This is the aggressiveness that people want to see from him. After the game he said he‚Äôs been working on his mental approach. Per espn, he said ‚ÄúHonestly, I‚Äôve been working on my mentality and my mental (approach) a lot these past few weeks. It‚Äôs not easy to do that, change the way you play. Certain things in the game come natural to certain people. I feel like I‚Äôm figuring it out.‚Äù  Jordan Clarkson hit 8 three pointers. And missed only his second free throw of the entire season. Him coming off the bench and immediately hitting his 3‚Äôs, including that fast break 3 pointer, brought the Jazz back into the game from being down 14. I think Jordan Clarkson is an extremely valuable piece of this team, definitely the 6MOTY frontrunner in my eyes."
Had enough time to give Ben Simmons a hug
Ben Simmons career point avg is 16. Scoring fucking 4 to 9 points extra point is not going to sacrifice all the aboveü§¶ he's 6'10 freak not a 5'10 midget
&gt; Westbrook is among the most impactful players of recent memory.  He absolutely was up until 2018. Unfortunately he's not anymore. Ben Simmons is easily more impactful nowadays.
You're not a fan of Joel Embiid or Ben Simmons?

ok now what about Ben Simmons vs Bruno Caboclo? both have elite length so it's a toss up to me
"tbh 42 for Ben Simmons is like 60 for a 3pt shooting guard, just not normal"
We are talking about his offense. Are you telling me you don't think Ben Simmons can be better then draymond on offense?
"the australian citizenship thing is weird. Like Ben Simmons is Australian because he grew up there and his Mom is Australian. Matisse Thybulle plays for Australia and he's a citizen, and he chose to play for Australia as opposed to US.   Kyrie I beleive has dual citizenship, but has chosen to play for USA"
This is like saying Ben Simmons is an elite shooter because he averages 16 a game
"&gt; he wanted was for players not to get mocked and / or black-balled because they want a trade out of somewhere  &gt;  he just wants a bit more consideration for players who demand trades  Nah, they can get fucked IMO. Disloyal doubchebags who don't respect their words and their signatures should definitely be blackballed and mocked.   &gt; have the same energy when teams sit players in preparation to trade players  I will have the same energy is a team refuses to pay a player while sitting him out. Until then, nah, he doesn't have a point.  &gt; It really isn‚Äôt that much to ask for.  He's essentially asking for people to look after the interests of players and not the interests of the teams? Why? I'm a fan of the Philadelphia 76ers, not of Joel Embiid or Ben Simmons.   He's literally asking us to go against our own interests, and the imbeciles above are cheering him on, lmao."
Only way I ever see a trade involving draymond is for Ben Simmons like at minimum or another KD level player (obviously never gonna happen). Even then our system completely has to shift around to either Curry main ball handler or something else.
"If you wouldn't say that James Harden is much better than Ben Simmons, then I'm sorry but you don't understand basketball."
Magic Johnson - an unusually tall point guard who started one game at center because his team's traditional center was injured. He drops 42 points.            Ben Simmons - an unusually tall point guard who started one game at center because his team's traditional center was injured. He drops 42 points.
I agree that Ben would be a better fit but it wouldn't be perfect because you still have two players in the starting lineup who can't shoot (Simmons and Theis)
One interesting thing about Simmons is that his personality is as enigmatic and controversial as his gameplay.   Tbh I like when guys don‚Äôt pretend to be humble and want this shit talking all the time from Ben
"That‚Äôs literally revisionist history. Magic shot terrible from 3 for the first several seasons of his career when players barely shot from 3 but by the 1990 season, Magic shot over 38% from 3 on 276 attempts.   He became one of the best high volume 3 point shooters in the league. In today‚Äôs era, practicing 3‚Äôs all the time, there‚Äôs good reason to think Magic would involve into a fantastic shooter with good spacing.  Magic was also known for having great quickness for his size (similar to Ben Simmons although he‚Äôs obviously nowhere near the defender of Ben) and Magic‚Äôs handles were pretty good.  Magic would have to adapt to the half court offense for sure and his defense wasn‚Äôt amazing, although he had good interior defense and would be great at switching in certain situations because of his size.  But to say Magic is worse than LeBron at everything is absurd. Magic was better at handles, arguable better at passing and court vision, and even in the same conversation on offensive BBIQ.   When you watch Magic in 1980 he dominated to 1980 style of play. By 1990, his shooting and spacing and even defense had evolved.  To say he couldn‚Äôt adapt to today‚Äôs game is kinda silly to me and sounds like the older guys who say today‚Äôs players couldn‚Äôt deal with the toughness of the 80s/90s"
"Ben Simmons is 6'11"". and thank god for that, another inch would've rendered him immobile"
"I don't particularly fond of Ben Simmons, if were being real. Who cares who I'm a fan of? I just love the game and I call it how I see it. And I was actually rooting for the jazz a lot this year but I'm starting to run into a lot of overly sensitive Jazz fans, and it's ruining the whole rooting for the jazz thing for me lol.   And Ben just dropped a career high. He definitely wasn't bitching about having to work harder"
"Ben Simmons is 13-0 against Kemba Walker, so him"
In theory it should work. But Rudy sucked off simmons to protect the paint like he normally does. And it just gave simmons too much room to get downhill. By the time Rudy met simmons in the paint Ben was already going near full speed. That‚Äôs hard for anybody to stop.
"Why are you, an LAC fan, fighting this battle for Ben Simmons? Rudy‚Äôs perimeter game has gotten a lot better against guards. Maybe Bens size played a factor, but then again, maybe it‚Äôs just Ben bitching because he had to work harder against Rudy."
Ben Simmons did drop 42
Not sure what the Jazz thinking was but I like the idea of put Gobert on Simmons knowing he‚Äôll try to go off against him. Then you shoot 3s on the other side. Youre betting they won‚Äôt keep up cause Ben isn‚Äôt shooting 3s. And it worked. Kudos to the evil mastermind Quin
When Ben was the tallest guy on the court Rudy guarded him. Mostly though it was Oneale and Bojan (or nobody in the case of Q1). Simmons just scrapping for something to be salty about because his career high went to waste.
"Is his name Donovan Mitchell, did the highest paid center ever allow jokic and Ben Simmons to drop a 50 and 40 ball on his head?"
"Ben Simmons got his career high of 42pts in the last game, and the Jazz still won"
Ben Simmons gonna take it personal and take a few 3s next game better watch out
It would be cool if clarkson could play all nba level defense every game like Ben Simmons.
I know it‚Äôs all in fun but Tatum has 22 30+ pt games  Ben Simmons has 6 30+ pt games
Ben Simmons has delivered his classic yearly performance that is used to defend him for being painfully average the rest of the year let‚Äôs go üíØüíØ
shit I guess Ben Simmons has been coasting all his career. This dude can do this against one of the top defense team I expect him to be able to step up and avg at least 25/8/8
"Randle is currently 14th in the league in Win Shares, 23rd in BPM, 12th in VORP, and 10th in RAPTOR WAR.  He's putting up career high points, rebounds, and assists (22.4/11.1/5.6). He hasn't missed a game this season and leads the league in minutes played.  I think he should be considered a lock for the all-star team if you're looking at stats, both traditional and advanced. He has a stronger statistical argument than guys like Trae Young, Khris Middleton, Bradley Beal, Bam Adebayo, Kyrie Irving, Zach Lavine, Domantas Sabonis, and Ben Simmons.  You can make individual arguments here and there, Kyrie/Beal/Trae/Lavine's scoring numbers, Bam and Simmons' defense, playmaking, team record, etc. But take the overall package and compare Randle to each, and I think Randle deserves a spot more than most of those guys."
&gt;Ben Simmons good. Utah Jazz good.    and Jordan Clarkson is just GREAT.  What a u/madlad
"Ben ""Akashi Seijuro"" Simmons"
"&gt;Wasn‚Äôt expecting a Ben Simmons vs Jordan Clarkson 1v1 but I‚Äôll take it.    Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris was insane.. They had their best games of the season, just to have Jordan fuckin Clarkson off the bench ruin their night with a 40 bomb.  &gt;  Seems like the Jazz just can't stop winning at the moment.. 2021 is wild"
He did average 21/9/7.5 in 19 games with 60% FG to start 2020. But then injuries happened and we never saw that version of Ben Simmons until today.
KOC last night on the simmons pod:  &gt;We are seeing the best version we have ever seen of Ben Simmons this season. &gt; &gt;Right now he looks like he's one of the best two guys on a championship team.
"As well as Ben Simmons played today, he was straight garbage in the clutch."
Ben Simmons looks different in the thumbnail
The fuck? The only thing Smart does better than Simmons is shooting threes at a bad % and flopping. Why would we downgrade every aspect of Ben for some low % three point shooting?
"Way to be an obnoxious asshole for no cause buddy  I wasn‚Äôt trashing Ben Simmons, I‚Äôm trashing the quality of this highlight video"
"And I‚Äôd be proud to be a part of the game. Your criteria for Ben Simmons speaks for itself. It‚Äôs an unfair standard that I‚Äôd doubt you‚Äôve applied to any other player. The 8 foot layup is one of Bens most efficient shots and was drawing fouls. Yes he fizzled out but I can‚Äôt get mad him. He‚Äôs the only reason we were there. It‚Äôs nothing personal between me and you and not a big deal, have a good night"
"nuggets fans are starting to go full ""Ben Simmons isnt really a rookie because Embiid's basically just as valuable on offense as Jokic and plays DPOY level defense and we have no case outside of box plus minus and other volume stats"""
Ben Simmons was unstoppable tonight. May be because he got more space when Embid is not on the court? Anyways what a game
"Giannis stride is just long, he's not as fast as it seems.  Ben Simmons however from the eye test is real fast, quick feet, etc."
"Quite a few dudes on this sub owe Ben an apology, especially some that had Celtics and Jazz flairs (literally only remember the flairs but you know who you are) that really went all in on the Simmons shit talk this season from what I remember. I mean he might not have a capable 3 point shot but he‚Äôs a defensive superstar and a more vital part of the 76ers that a lot of people realised"
"Very true, and besides free throw shooting (which has improved) is the only serious knock on Simmons. It‚Äôs a shame, and I wonder if it‚Äôs simply the inverse of what we dealt with as Jazz fans with Kirilenko. AK was a player ahead of his time, Ben is a player that dominates every game an era ago."
"You‚Äôre projecting so much out of your anger dude calm down and read what I‚Äôm saying. I really like Ben. He‚Äôs easily one of the most gifted players in the league. Yes, furkan and Danny suck shit, yet Simmons still was forced to defer to them because he wasn‚Äôt capable of producing enough points himself. The jazz were hitting 3‚Äôs down the stretch, and Simmons was missing 10 foot hook shots. Do you really not see anything wrong with that?"
How you treat Ben Simmons in the perimeter
We had 40 minutes of Furkan and Danny Green combining to go 1-11 for 3 points in 40 points. Ben Simmons had a phenomenal game and you are judging him because you don‚Äôt like him and set him to some ridiculous standard. How come Beal isn‚Äôt judged when he stops big points and loses games? His teammates are blamed.
Why do people hate Ben Simmons. It baffles me
ESPN Tomorrow : Is Ben Simmons a better player than Giannis?
"I'm actually more confident after this game. We were missing Embiid and Shake and played them pretty close, even if they didn't have Conley. Also Ben Simmons finally stopped playing like tall Rondo and Tobias is heating up again"
"6MOTY race is over, just give it to Clarkson already. Also Ben Simmons heard y‚Äôall talking shit."
"Yeah I wish we could have played you guys healthy. Ben Simmons is one of my favorite players to watch, his glass drives were a thing of lost beauty."
"Ben Simmons very good  Tobias Harris also pretty good  Joel Embiid injured  Rest of Sixers not good   Sixers lose  In all seriousness, whenever Ben or Tobi didn‚Äôt have the ball I was in pain, meanwhile Jazz are really good man and Conley is out rn, hopefully both teams are full strength for round 2"
"I'm glad we came out winners but holy crap, Ben Simmons was insane and Harris was right behind him. GG Sixers, if it wasn't for our walking bucket tonight it might have bdsm different. Clarkson is something else man."
Ben Simmons was getting a friendly whistle. Stop this nonsense.
Ben Simmons.
Ben Simmons will never be a superstar.
"I mean that makes sense and all....  Problem for the Jazz is that they have to go through teams with guys like Jokic and AD to get to the Finals...  Gobert‚Äôs inability to play well against superior bigs is gonna really hurt them in the postseason.   Also, Ben Simmons had his way with the Jazz in the paint the first time we played them this year....so what‚Äôs Lebron gonna do?"
"I took a [screencap](https://i.imgur.com/a9QGdkv.jpg). Baseline ref called it which is important because that's not the angle fans see. Mitchell puts his arm in front of Ben and keeps it there as a hook when he spins back. Ben ends up with him sort of arm barred because of it, but the baseline ref called the hook first. I'd prefer a no call, especially since Mitchell's hook wasn't that strong. It's often used to bait fouls, which arguably Simmons committed *if* the hook isn't called."
https://streamable.com/konyxi  Also it was immediately after the Jazz threw the ball backcourt and the refs determined that Ben Simmons' toe had possession of the ball for it not to be a violation
"Okay true not the majority, but a lot. Far more than most bigs and anyone else known for their defense. Ben Simmons locks down the other team's best player night in night out."
Did you see how frustrated Ben Simmons made Donovan tonight?it's like all of the salt came out from him not winning ROY. Locked up.
A ben simmons special
Obviously the next Ben Simmons with a 3 point shot.
"I'm talking about people calling Ben Simmons ""not a rookie"" when he won rookie of the year."
It's the Ben Simmons argument all over again.
Embiid and Simmons own gobert.  Simmons putted 42 pts on gobert's head (I AM TALKING ABOUT BEN SIMMONS)  Embiid doing Embiid things not suprised but satisfied. DPOY Gobert lol (he is a good defender) but give it to Simmons cuz mitchell shoot 35% from the field and we know ben can guard all positions.
Ben Simmons was still a rookie when he won ROY. Ben &gt; Don
DPOY BEN SIMMONS TO YOU
"Apparently Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris and Embiid all reffed the game"
Ben Simmons grabs Mitchell‚Äôs arm - Mitchell turns and shoots - offensive foul on Mitchell. Go off king.
"True,  it getting Ben Simmons clamped on you and Joel Embiid defending the rim on your drives is pretty tough going. He was clearly frustrated, be it the officiating or the suffocating defense, which led to him just tossing a few up and then losing his cool."
Somehow Dwight Howard has a better career 3 point shooting percentage than Ben Simmons.
The defense of Ben Simmons will drive a man to the edge
karma for Ben Simmons' Mickey Mouse ROY Award /s
And Ben Simmons still can‚Äôt....
"Fair enough, you better have been a Ben Simmons ROY support then haha."
Yup cause Ben Simmons holding kyrie to 40
Was Ben Simmons disguised as the refs?
Ben Simmons took him to the 6th Dimension
Ben Simmons supermax prison hits different in OT
"HE HAD A LONGER PRISON SENTENCE THAN KCP. BEN ""THE WARDEN"" SIMMONS ISN'T PLAYING ANYMORE."
welcome to the Ben Simmons state penitentiary
Ben Simmons
"Gonna go against the grain here and say that game was actually fairly well refereed. 1 or 2 bad calls don‚Äôt invalidate the rest of the  game which was pretty fair.  All that aside that was a great game. Jazz turned it over I‚Äôm sure more than they would have hoped but also shot really well on a lot of good looks. Both teams balanced their offence and defence effort really well. Philly turned it over less than normal which is really really important for us, and started to find the range in the second half a bit.  Great performances from Joel the whole game. Simmons and Thybulle did the job of forcing secondary playmakers to beat them and *finally* keeping Clarkson under control. Conley/Bog/and Ingles almost did win it though, very hard players to defend and they aren‚Äôt even the most dangerous threats. Mitchell tried but probs missed a few shots he would definitely make normally and was definitely making in the playoffs. Ben and Joel were good offensively and great to see Tobi come through in the clutch and OT with some iso plays, along with good defence most of the game.  Think Jazz would definitely be favoured in a series but that was very interesting to watch. GG Jazz pleasure playing against you. Great squad having a great year and I think they can definitely take it to the best of the West."
Ben Simmons would never
Should have been kick ball on Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons would never
Ben simmons defense is INSANE
# OFFENSIVE FOUL BITCH. BEN SIMMONS DPOY
THE BALL TOUCHED BEN SIMMONS‚Äô FOOT.
"Gobert is overrated man, Ben Simmons for DPOY if you know you know"
Ben Simmons could never
"We‚Äôre so starved for 3pt shots that Dwight Howard is forced to shoot. This is why I hate this Sixers team becau‚Äî- He fucking hit it? What?  Edit: That is Ben Simmons‚Äô shooting partner btw. No, I‚Äôm not kidding"
We talking about Bron winning MVP in year 18 when we should be talking bout Ben Simmons running away with ROTY in year 5.
O‚ÄôNeal really fell for a Ben Simmons pumpfake üò≠
This version of Ben simmons is so much fun
He's a great guy to have on a team. He has a mini Ben Simmons effect I'd say.
Replace ‚ÄúJazz‚Äù with ‚ÄúBen Simmons‚Äù and see what happens
"You said ‚Äúseasons‚Äù, this Ben Simmons burner?"
"this hasnt been Ben Simmons best defensive game, keeps being late on these rotations."
"A proper roster that hasn‚Äôt won a game in a month lmaooooo. That losing streak seems to have really taken a toll on your brain cell count. You‚Äôre dead on though, utterly brilliant decision to turn down a 24 year old All-NBA player and DPOY candidate (who, once again, you could‚Äôve easily turned and flipped for another massive haul if you didn‚Äôt want to keep him (ROstER bUilDiNg BRuH) because NBA teams aren‚Äôt as stupid as r/nba nephews like yourself and know how good Simmons is) to instead take on a washed up, checked out Oladipo who you‚Äôre gonna get a pile of dogshit for at the deadline Lolol.  Your owner destroyed a contender he inherited damn near immediately and intervened in the Harden trade process to make a decision based off spiting someone else he had some petty beef with instead of doing what was best for his own team. Sound familiar at all? If it doesn‚Äôt, check my flair.  Your owner is Western Conference James Dolan who doesn‚Äôt even have Dolan‚Äôs one redeeming quality because he won‚Äôt spend money lol. You‚Äôre in for a long run of watching absolutely horrendous basketball. Hmu if you need advice on how to cope, I‚Äôve been doing it for 20 years. You‚Äôre in for 5+ years of watching Ben Simmons make All-NBA teams while y‚Äôall get picks in the late 20s from one of the best run organizations in the league rn who isn‚Äôt gonna bottom out any time soon. That‚Äôs gonna require Olympic level mental gymnastics and homer rationalization which I‚Äôm also very proficient in so again holler at me whenever."
You still salty after our Ben simmons locked up luka and that our team destroyed your mavs on national?
It was actually Ben Simmons who dad dicked Gobert last time we played the Jazz (Embiid was out)
So what are the Rockets going to do if the 2026 maybe becomes like a number 1 pick? Use that and draft someone who maybe becomes as good as Ben Simmons?  EDIT: They also seemed to have valued a Bucks pick over getting Jarrett Allen. They're just overvaluing them.
Ben Simmons is not a DPOY
Not for Ben Simmons
Wouldn't get 4 1st for Ben Simmons.
"i mean I understand becasue then the front office is force to build around ben simmons quickly... tough job to do. I know as fans it makes the most sense but think about it as a job, the picks give you more job security for longer."
Ben Simmons just can‚Äôt get it up
Seriously cant believe what a horrible trade they got lol coulda had Ben Simmons instead they got 4 late first round picks HAHAHAHA
"add in the details part too. the 2nd pick is protected and likely just 2nds but this is pretty realistic imo   The details: In an Eastern Conference race that is wide open, the 76ers could desperately use another dynamic two-way player. Bringing Lowry, a North Philadelphia native, back home could be the difference-making move that results in the 76ers' return to the NBA Finals for the first time in 20 years.  Yes, Lowry, a pending free agent, is going to turn 35 the day of the NBA trade deadline. And yes, giving up multiple first-round picks and a young player in Maxey would be difficult.  But it's a move Philadelphia should make. The 76ers add a proven playoff performer who would give coach Doc Rivers flexibility in how he deploys Ben Simmons. With Lowry's Bird rights, the Sixers could either extend him before the season ends or re-sign him this summer.  For other contenders, like the LA Clippers, the difficulty in trading for Lowry comes with both making the cap math work (Lowry makes $30.5 million this season) and giving Toronto something it needs in return. This trade accomplishes both.  Maxey and the picks will help Toronto add to its core of Fred VanVleet, Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby moving forward. Green, Scott and Ferguson all have expiring deals that can be rerouted to Cleveland so the Raptors can add Drummond, shoring up their center position without taking on long-term money.  The Cavaliers would recoup the second-round pick they gave up to acquire Drummond last season.  -- Tim Bontemps"
"I think KGs defense is at least comparable to simmons if not outright better.   The Jokic-KD hybrid is also a ‚Äútop defensive player‚Äù while being one of the best offensive weapons. We are seeing this year that Jokic‚Äôs arsenal of offensive tricks is pretty equivalent to Steph Curry‚Äôs offensive output.  Ben has other aspects of his offensive game that already exist, of course. But Steph also has aspects of his game besides his shooting that simmons isn‚Äôt getting. Steph‚Äôs passing and off-ball movement are significantly underrated, as an example. And while Ben gets curry‚Äôs shooting, it doesn‚Äôt mean he gets the benefits of curry‚Äôs ability to get open for those shots. I think this makes up for any disparity in passing/size that simmons has in utilizing his existing game on offense.  So I think it‚Äôs reasonable enough to equate the ‚ÄúBen curry‚Äù player as just having more or less Steph‚Äôs impact offensively.  So at that point it basically boils down to: KGs defense vs Ben‚Äôs defense Steph‚Äôs offense vs Jokic‚Äôs offense  And I think both are pretty close. I tend to lean towards KG on defense (though Ben is still young and developing and is very impressive). And I‚Äôm a homer for Jokic who loves his offense, but of obviously Steph‚Äôs shooting and gravity is one of the biggest offensive X factors of all time.  I don‚Äôt think people realize how fucking scary Jokic would be with KDs defense, though. One of the biggest weaknesses our team has right now is finding a good way to build around jokic‚Äôs lack of rim protection. He‚Äôs still a good defender in other ways, but not having a rim protector can be punishing given that we also struggle to stop dribble penetration at the perimeter. If Jokic was instead an elite rim protector who was also switchable out to the perimeter? It‚Äôs game fucking over, man. It‚Äôs like having the defense of AD and the offensive wizardry of lebron in one package."
Is Ben Simmons not a guard or is he not 6‚Äô11
"I know our record this year, but I'm still shocked we are on this list.   We were hot garbage in the bubble last year after Brett Brown made his secrit adjustments to turn Ben Simmons into a full time PF during the break.   Pretty sure we gave up a 50 burger to TJ Warren and also lost on a game winner to Stanley Johnson lmao."
"Also, there are fewer four-year players in the NBA. If you're one and done, you don't need to try as hard in school.\*   \*This isn't saying one and done players are dumb. LeBron didn't even go to college and he's an extremely smart person. It's just that it's *easier* to not try in class if you're going to the NBA. The other caveat is that school isn't everything. Ben Simmons strikes me as fairly intelligent and he didn't go to class his second semester at LSU."
"&gt; [Ben Simmons can easily take 4 or 5 steps between dribbles and NO ONE EVER QUESTIONS IT, this is completely natural and there is nothing illegal about it.](https://youtu.be/0ZmbSZFp9jE?t=139)    I have to say, I find it remarkable given your alleged qualifications how little you've apparently read basketball rules.  That play is frequently illegal.  The FIBA rules are much more precise on this, and virtually all other, topics.  They would be worth your time to read.  While they may not be the book of record in this country very often, they do a good job of explaining what is, and is not, legal.  &gt;24.1 Dribbling   &gt;   &gt;There is no limit to the number of steps a player may take **when the ball is not in contact with his hand.**   &gt;   &gt;FIBA Basketball rules  Also the NCAA rulebook.  &gt;Art. 4. The dribble ends when:   &gt;   &gt;a.	The dribbler catches or carries/palms the ball by allowing it to come to rest in one or both hands;   &gt;   &gt;NCAA basketball rules  It is possible to legally take 4 or 5 steps between dribbles, but you must do it in the time when the ball is not in contact with your hand, which is rarely the case."
"You‚Äôre so right, this year‚Äôs MVP race should be between Rudy Gobert and Ben Simmons"
"Would Ben Simmons with Steph Curry level shooting be willing to shoot? If he's not afraid of missing, definitely Ben."
Ben Simmons with Curry shooting is the best player in the league.
"Ben Simmons called, and is asking about this ""shooting coach"" you speak of."
ben simmons snubbed
"When you nitpick advanced stats that favor big men, yes Gobert will look better because he‚Äôs a good rim protector. I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs a bad player, he just didn‚Äôt look good against the sixers last time so that‚Äôs the last impression I have of him lol.  Either way, he only guards centers but Ben will rotate from guarding spida to gobert in a single possession, which IMO increases his value so much. Even if his advanced stats aren‚Äôt as good, you have to keep in mind he‚Äôs a guard and these do not favor guards who are actually good defenders(see today‚Äôs nba.com dpoy rankings lol). Advanced stats don‚Äôt tell the eye test here either way, but I think you have to give Simmons some leeway there considering he guards the best player on the other team night in night out.   That doesn‚Äôt mean he should win but it has to be considered"
No Ben Simmons???
Ben Simmons is the most overrated fucking defender in the league. LeBron is better
"I've said this before, but I think Ben Simmons plays the best where the other player scores anyways I've ever seen. I think alot of it is how much of an island they like to leave him on"
"Embiid because I always wanted to know what would happen if they switched places  Jamal Murray and Embiid and Ben Simmons and Jokic would be pretty sick duos, right?"
You thought the fit with Ben Simmons was awkward with _one_ Embiid...
"First that hard Ben Simmons foul on Norman Powell, and now this?  NBA refs are a joke."
Shoutout to his beef with Ben Simmons lol
"Ben Simmons or Anthony Davis. It seems crazy because both are allstars and All NBA calibre players but they could do SO much more.  With Simmons, his lack of aggression on offence is frustrating. Never mind his 3 point shot, if he just ran like Lebron or Giannis and attacked the rim he could get so much more points.   With AD, on the offensive end, he has games where he plays really bad but because of his size and amount of fouls he gets, he can still get his points total up.  Both do have amazing defence though. No complaints on that end."
He won‚Äôt win. Ben Simmons or Rudy Gobert will win.
Ben Simmons has an offensive game?
Kemba &gt; Ben Simmons
Well at least Ben Simmons hasn‚Äôt started any plagues.
Should‚Äôve gotten Ben Simmons
No Ben Simmons smh
Ben Simmons is to tonight's big loser and for his punishment he has to be a rookie again.
"Yup. Lavine and AG was great after the fact but Lebron Vs Giannis Vs Donovan Mitchell Vs Ben Simmons would be infinitely easier to market and would probably get more people actually watching the Dunk contest on the night of, instead of in highlight videos the next day."
Ben Simmons needs to do this at least once. A guy that size with his hops and athletic ability...  it has to happen.  Ill take Toppin out of this group.
ben simmons snubbed
Better then Ben Simmons scoring 0
"Ben Simmons would like a word. Man had to guard Lebron, Kawhi, Dame, Booker, Luka, Sexton and the list goes on. The versatility let‚Äôs him be able to guard the opposing teams best player every night"
The Greek Ben Simmons.
I understand ben simmons is an insane one on one defender however Gobert is literally an entire defensive system wrapped into one player. Gobert is the dpoy and anybody that says other wise probably voted for murray.
Has ben Simmons clogging the paint
"Ben has nothing to do with #5. Go watch what he did to Dame and Luka. This isn't an opinion anymore, Ben Simmons is a menace on D. He's going to be All-NBA 1st Defense for years to come."
"&gt;Even considering throwing in Adams's contract, you're looking at a real small amount of ""players that make a ton of money and are tradeable."" Chris Paul? Ben Simmons? Kemba Walker?  you dont need to salary match if the team has has the cap space to absorb it."
How come certain players just can't shoot at all? While they're so athletic? Ben Simmons and Giannis for example.
"Strongly disagree. The DPOY used to always be a perimeter player, see Michael Jordan, Sidney Moncrief, Alvin Robertson.   To me, defense is more than rim protection and rebound and block averages. A guy like Gobert has been exposed by perimeter players for not being able to keep up laterally.  A guy like Draymond at his peak was able to guard the post, guard 1s for short spurts, protect the rim, man the glass, etc...   I think the DPOY should go to more perimeter players to be honest and I think it should go to Ben Simmons this year (so far)."
"Ben Simmons, Dort, Giannis, Myles Turner, Gobert  Jrue Holiday, Royce O'Neale &amp; OG Anunoby should be on the 2nd team"
I don‚Äôt have a full list but Ben Simmons and Rudy Gobert are locks.
"Mikal Bridges is one of the two guys who is both long enough AND strong enough AND quick enough to guard him, along with Ben Simmons.  Luka has a really difficult time playing against both of them, which is why he routinely struggles against the Sixers and Suns"
"So if Ben Simmons wins DPOY and Embiid wins MVP this year, how deep in the playoffs do they need to make it to not be considered a disappointment?   I'm thinking if both their top guys get those awards, they gotta make it out of the East to be considered not a dud year. Maybe people will give them slack for losing to Brooklyn in the ECF."
Gimme some Ben Simmons and Dwight Howard while you‚Äôre at it
How is Ben Simmons still being disrespected like this?
Ben Simmons needs to swap his shooting hand for real.
Someone put Ben Simmons in a dress and heels
"‚ÄúI mean we men, you can assume‚Äù - Ben Simmons"
BuT bEn SiMmOnS iS dPoY
Ben Simmons is also eating him alive.
&gt;Probably a 1-2 team all defense but not DPOY he isn‚Äôt changing teams whole offenses like Gobert or shutting down players like Ben Simmons.  This comment is a great example of how 90% of discussion on defense is just regurgitating second-hand narratives and hoping the puke looks like something intelligent
He is a good defender with length and speed. He is overrated but a good defender on one of the top defensive teams. Probably a 1-2 team all defense but not DPOY he isn‚Äôt changing teams whole offenses like Gobert or shutting down players like Ben Simmons.
Ben Simmons is miles ahead of CJ. Sorry!!!
You‚Äôre right! Ben Simmons is a negative defender
I think Ben Simmons is the closest thing to Lebron in this league. But his nonexistent of shooting is just too big to ignore
"I think we‚Äôre honestly better off.  I‚Äôd rather not break up Embiid and Simmons and just space the offense around them then have two guys contesting for who gets the ball.  The team is beautifully set up right now, with Ben running the offense in transition and primarily in the half court.  Then Harris as the primary ball handler later in the shot clock, or Embiid down low.  Both have been fantastic isolation scorers, which Jimmy is as well, but Jimmy doesn‚Äôt space the floor better then the other two guys we have rn which we need way more."
but bill simmons forced theringer.com to push that ben simmons narrative though??  how can this be
"I'm sorry man, but the only way Ben Simmons finds his way to Portland is if Damian Lillard specifically requests a trade to Philadelphia. And if you're thinking about duos, then I guarantee an Embiid-Lillard duo is easily the most frightening combination in the league, even moreso than Ben-Dame."
Ben Simmons or Zion
yeah ben simmons is going to make a difference against the nets
Ben Simmons
What would the blazers have to throw in to get it done? Trent Jr. And Hood? Simmons too. I'm not sure philly wants anything to do with trading Ben. Blazers would most likely jump at that tho
everyone acting like ben simmons is better than CJ McCollum lol
Ain‚Äôt no way you think the blazers could get Ben Simmons in any way whatsoever this makes no sense

Ben simmons is the grim reaper for the knicks
I‚Äôm more surprised that a Ben Simmons highlight video posted here isn‚Äôt him making a 3
"Difference is when someone talks about Lowry's ass or calls Steve Kerr a hot little slut for the thousandth time, they do it for ""comedy"" and not because they're actually sexually attracted to them.   I think the overtly homoerotic jokes are way beyond a dead horse at this point. But as evidenced by the recent post on here where Doc talks about Ben Simmons being able to literally swallow players, r/nba will keep on beating it."
Ben Simmons would contest that ROY award
"I mean, Doc Rivers *literally* (proper way to use that word) told the world that Ben Simmons was a lock for DPOY earlier today when Gobert has been the clear frontrunner all season.  Pretty sure Gobert has posted up rent free in Doc Rivers‚Äô head, but y‚Äôall keep workin‚Äô on that cute narrative of yours!"
Ben Simmons
"Posts up like Barkley, drives to the basket like 87 Jordan, passes like Ben Simmons, shoots like Antoine Walker."
I think so. I meant consistently. Sabonis had a legit skyhook(but was fat and super far from his former elite athleticism so he didn‚Äôt do it as much) and I‚Äôve seen Ben Simmons to that running baby sky hook often.
13 is the number of times the Knicks have lost to Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons is an anaconda confirmed
"I can't help but constantly be amazed by Ben Simmons. He's just able to do everything (I know, except for shoot). He is just involved in all phases of the game, exterior and interior defense, ball handling, rebounding, penetrating. He's just able to provide value regardless of the situation, just an incredible player."
13-0 against Knicks Ben Simmons is yes
Ben Simmons just absolutely refuses to be beaten by the Knicks.
Ben Simmons is still undefeated vs. the Knicks.
"Psssh never in doubt, you really though Ben Simmons was gonna lose to the Knicks  For real though the Knicks put up a hell of a fight considering the game they played just last night, their defense is crazy good"
Ben Simmons has never lost to the Knicks
Yall really thought Ben Simmons was gonna lose to the knicks
"Probably should've lost that game. Bad decisions by Knicks late in the 4th, including trying to iso Ben Simmons on back to back possessions with both Korkmaz and Seth Curry on the floor.   Either way was a very fun game overall though. Knicks played great D"
Imagining Ben Simmons galloping around at TE. Dude would be quite the mismatch with his speed/size.
"Ben Simmons still undefeated against the Knicks üò§  What a great, physical game. Thibs has the Knicks playing hard."
Ben Simmons is now 13-0 against the Knicks.
"people are. Everyone forgets what it looks like to deal with giannis without a dedicated counter (bam/kawhi+gasol/Al hortford till he got gassed in the third quarter).  It looks like giannis either going to the line, scoring, or kicking out to an open 3.  and thats not even taking into account his defensive abilities. the 2 other teams that can challenge in the east have no way of dealing with that (I don't want to hear about how ben simmons is going to clamp giannis because he wont).  Unless they try the ""drop coverage on duncan robinson"" strategy from last year on curry/ Harris, I've got them in the finals"
Ben Simmons has never lost to the Knicks
The Knicks cannot beat Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons has still never lost to the Knicks.
We got Korkmaz and Seth on the floor and Knicks are isoing Ben Simmons lmao
"bill simmons has pushed theringer.com to push ben simmons DPOY, in part because his son is named ben simmons  the ben simmons narrative is so manufactured that ill be very sad if gobert gets railroaded when hes clearly the best defender in the nba"
"&gt; /nba: ‚Äúbest defensive player on the best defensive team should be DPOY‚Äù  &gt; r/nba when lebron is the best defensive player on the best defense: ‚Äúactually defense is more nuanced than that, it‚Äôs actually a team effort!‚Äù  The first group isn't the same as the second group. I had to swim in a sea of downvotes in the Ben Wallace HoF thread last week because people here literally can't grasp the fact that Chauncey, Rip, Tayshaun, Rasheed, McDyess and Arroyo. Along with Larry Brown who literally coached the #1 defense on a different team 3 years prior, all had a lot to do with that team being a GOAT defense.  Only 1 player can get credit with DPOY. Doesn't mean they're the only player that makes the defense #1 overall.  Literally watching the game it's easier to see who the most impactful individual defenders are, regardless of their team ranking. This year that should be Ben Simmons."
"Kyle Lowry, Stephen Curry, Joe Ingles, Ben Simmons, Bam Adebayo.  League fucked."
Simmons had a career high game with Gobert as their main paint defender. Ben only shoots in the paint.
Ben Simmons is imperfect cell?
"&gt;stats stats stats numbers numbers numbers  Don't care, the eye test tells me it's Ben Simmons"
ben simmons has better 3pt pct. than him
Didn't Ben Simmons throw down a putback dunk over Giannis the next possession
"Good luck being physical with a 250 pound center with handles and who‚Äôs probably as fast as most guards in the 90s. Seriously, Ben Simmons, Giannis and LeBron would be far more dominant back then. They‚Äôre built like trucks and have the speed of Lamborghinis.  Giannis isn‚Äôt going to post up Shaq, he‚Äôs going to blow by him when he tries to guard him on the perimeter."
"People sleeping on Ben Simmons  People defending LeBron after instances of him playing dirty, we all know he's amazing at ball but a dirty okay is a dirty play"
"It's clutch time. Kyrie brings the ball up the court.  KD and Harden are standing at the wings.  Jeff Green and Bruce Brown in the corners.  Ben Simmons, accepting the defensive challenge: *oh fuck yeah spread it*"
Nobody...and I mean NOBODY..WILL EVER SAY BEN SIMMONS IS A SPITTER
"Ben ""Riley Reid"" Simmons"
Ben ‚ÄúKirby‚Äù Simmons
Ben ‚ÄúKirby‚Äù Simmons  Paging u/Sim888
ben simmons swallows confirmed
the thread also says ‚Äúif Ben Simmons doesn‚Äôt improve‚Äù
"I don't think Kyrie thinks the Nets are ""his team"". I don't think Ben Simmons thinks the Sixers are ""his team"". I don't think Khris Middleton thinks the Bucks are ""his team"".    It's just pure delusion for PG to think it was his team over Kawhi's. That's the equivalent of AD thinking the Lakers are his team over Lebron."
Prime J Kidd was a lot better than current Ben Simmons
"That should be a HUGE red flag to start. The idea that a top 5 defender from a season ago would have dropped off to one of the worst in the league this season should immediately be ringing alarm bells. If you watch him, he doesn't really seem to be worse defensively from last season and has actually looked more disruptive in passing lanes and more athletic overall.   RPM also has Devonte Graham as an elite defender this year, even ahead of AD, Embiid, Ben Simmons, and Giannis. RPM just gives really bad results compared to general consensus as well as the eye test, so it's generally wise to take anything RPM says with a grain of salt."
FVV is good but he's not as good as Ben simmons let's not get carried away Ben can guard basically every position
"I mean he‚Äôs also genuinely one of the best players in the league for generating deflections and steals with his length and hands, not in like a curry/Westbrook/Iverson way that involves selling out on the perimeter either. Yeah the rim protection is bad but the rest of his defense is actually quite good. Just like how Ben Simmons and Giannis are good offensively despite lacking jumpers, Jokic is ok overall on D even with bad rim protection"
I mean if Ben Simmons can be a rookie for 3 years why not.
"If your point is that the team just wants to tank, okay that's fine. That's different than saying that Ben Simmons is worth more or less than some other package.  I'm not averse to tanking, though I do think its overrated as a strategy and that building around a star is a great strategy - one that the Rockets themselves employed almost 10 years ago."
"Giannis, Embiid is greg oden 2.0, sad but he's wayyyy too injury prone  Giannis won't win you shit either, because he becomes Ben Simmons 2.0 in the playoffs, but atleast he will play minutes"
"I know we love Ben Simmons, but Kyrie is simply a better player right now having a better season. 28 on 52/41/88. So it's Kyrie for 3rd team, along with someone out Simmons, Beal, and Booker."
"Tatum playoff numbers: 45 games, 26-19, 3 ECF's, 20.6/7.0/3.4 .448/.351/.815   Ben Simmons playoff numbers: 22 games 12-14, Never got out of the second round, 15.0/8.1/6.5 .552/.000/.653"
"if ben simmons is up there on his overrated list (as a sixers fan!) and cp3 is his most overrated, my guy only cares about one stat, ppg"
"There are plenty of 6ft plus people who do not understand not play basketball meanwhile you have people as short as Muggsy playing in the NBA.   It was just insult at someone's physical appearance after a comment on his subpar play. Whether you are black, short, fat, white, tall, hairy, what you look like has nothing to do with the commentary. Plenty of qualified people think Ben Simmons is overrated so far."
"You're the one caught up with assist numbers. Draymond averaging more assists than Ben Simmons, Lamelo, LeBron, Kyrie, Giannis &amp; Dame does not make him a great playmaker."
Ben Simmons is a 7th man. Jason Tatum is a 6th man.
"The Celtics 2 best players are top 3 picks, the Pelicans have 2 all-star caliber players who were both top 3 picks, 1 on their own accord and 1 through trading AD (yeah it‚Äôs called rebuilding, do your Googles), Donovan Mitchell was a lottery pick, Devin Booker was a lottery pick, Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons were lottery picks, Bam Adebayo was a lottery pick."
" people will always find a way to discredit his finals wins and highlight his losses. People can just bring back the OKC argument and say that the sixers were too young to stand a chance. Win a finals against Ben Simmons will rapidly turn into a meme. If the nets get there, Dinwinnie ain‚Äôt playing so it‚Äôs a fake ring Lol ""twitter"" won‚Äôt give him credit for that unless he beats the whole squad. If AD gets to dominate against a team with Jeff green and DJ at center, then Bron got carried."
"If your best player is either Jaylen Brown or Ben Simmons, then your team is not winning the championship. Those guys can be 2nd or 3rd options (probably 3rd) on a title team, but they're not good enough to be the best player on a champion."
Ben Simmons next!
If I had to pick gimme Ben Simmons.. although I don‚Äôt think either can be the best player on a championship team
"For those swaps to convey, not only do the Nets have to be bad, but the Rockets also have to be better than the Nets.  I think one of those unprotected picks is Milwaukee's pick.  There will obviously be no pick-swap in 2021.  Barring a historic collapse, next year's Nets and Bucks picks (by way of Cavs) will be ~25-30th - the kind of picks you trade to get a Markieff Morris or something like that.  With the Rockets rebuilding, it looks improbable that the swap conveys in 2023.  Christian Wood is a fine player, but I don't see them emerging as a playoff team in three years.  Maybe Nets start to regress in 2024 and they get a 20th pick?  So that's five picks that are probably not valuable at all.  That leaves 2025 swap, 2026 pick, and 2027 swap.  Historically (looking back at the last 20 years or so), the chances of getting an all-star caliber player in the late lottery (5-13) range of the NBA draft is less than 15%?  Even with three top 5 picks, where the chances of getting an all-star are closer to 33%, you can reasonably expect to draft . . . one Ben Simmons, one high-quality role player, and one bust.  Why not just take Ben Simmons + a couple of picks *now* rather than waiting for the chance to get a player like him 5 years into the future?"
"Both are great players who I would love to have on a championship contending team, but I wouldn't want to build around them at this point in their careers. But if I had to choose, Ben Simmons."
Ben Simmons.
Ben Simmons shooting 28% from 3 is a concern. I‚Äôm choosing Jaylen Brown
"Neither, but Ben Simmons and shooters can win you a bunch of regular season games"
"Neither should be a 1st option, but Ben Simmons. I think his next 11 games or so without Embiid will prove it too."
Embiid = AD. LeBron &gt; Simmons of Ben. The rest of 76ers supporting casts better. Whos better than Harris of Tobias on the lakers?
Ben Simmons
I did answer your question. Look no further than Ben Simmons- who isn't a top ten player.
What? Hell no. By himself Dray is just a high-level role player. The reason he's so integral to GSW is because the PnR is predicated upon Draymond's playmaking.  If you want a DPOY level facilitating Allstar forward look no further than Ben Simmons.
Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons is not worth more than 4 unprotected picks and pick swaps.  Most of those will convey after 2023.
He put up 35 twice just last year when first moving to the Cavs. He could be a poor mans Ben Simmons.
I think Ben Simmons is better
"I still don‚Äôt get why they drafted Fultz after he missed every shot during his workout. Should have swerved hard and taken Tatum.  Booker is less realistic of a timeline change.   Even if you don‚Äôt change any draft picks, if you just prevent them from their stupid trades, they could probably have a Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, Mikal Bridges, and Joel Embiid starting lineup."
"&gt;His free throw shooting is down from 2018.   He started off the season really slow from the line, around 55%. Ever since he changed his routine a few months back, he has shot over 70% from the line and more recently 20 of 21 in his last 3 games (small sample size but still.)  &gt;How is his shot Improved if he can‚Äôt hit the shots   People act like he physically can‚Äôt shoot. He isn‚Äôt Ben Simmons... 30% from three on 4 attempts per game isn‚Äôt great but it ain‚Äôt horrible. His 3pt%, like the FT%, started off a bit slow but he‚Äôs turned it around lately. This will probably go down as his best 3pt shooting season outside of his rookie year.  &gt;he has been doing the same decision making mistakes which is why he has the same amount of turnovers  This is not true. Last month he only had TWO charges,  which is something he really struggled with before.  &gt;and around the same amount of potential assist.  with a lower USG rate and change of role into a play finisher for a lot of possessions"
How bad of a shooter is Barrett? Deandre sagged off him like he was Ben Simmons lol im assuming thats the scouting report
Seriously lol. Like who are all these point guards that wouldn't have been targeted and wrecked by lebron? Ben Simmons who is basically a power forward? Maybe magic had the size but he wasn't a great defender. Chauncey was big and lebron smacked him. I guess Zeke would hack the shit out of him but it probably wouldn't matter.   I'd love to see the list of point guards who wouldn't have been targeted given the warriors personnel those years
"That‚Äôs because most streamers aren‚Äôt international superstar celebrities and they *have to* interact with fans and do grassroots shit. But if Lebron James started streaming COD and I subscribed and donated to him what‚Äôs he gonna say, ‚Äúthank you smokahontas?‚Äù Hell no. It‚Äôs one thing for Dunkey to shout out a fan for subbing but nobody expects Lebron to shout them out or chat or whatever. Literally all he‚Äôd have to do is record a few matches with Steph and Ben Simmons and he‚Äôd be making millions (more.)"
Welcome to yourrrrrrr daily dose of Ben Simmons.
"I feel like simmons would be a more versatile person to build around whereas trae young is a better first option, therefore i ultimately think a team anchored with ben simmons would do better than one lead by trae young"
"Ben Simmons, defense is very important to me, he‚Äôs far more likable, and I have a thing for big PG‚Äôs  And I just hate watching Trae Young play basketball"
Ah the daily Ben Simmons comparison
"Funniest thing about Chris Paul being loved now is that he is universally known as a dirty player and shithead but now he‚Äôs beloved it‚Äôs hilarious.   FWIW, paul is an all time guard while ben simmons can‚Äôt shoot outside of the paint."
Because Ben can't shoot. And considering most of this sub are teenagers they only respect player who can shoot.  You never here 2k fans say I'm a beast with Ben Simmons...
"I was being facetious my dude. As I said before, if people are misinterpreting the title as saying Ben Simmons was the accused here, than those people have poor grammatical comprehension or are reading too fast to react to the story. In other words, there's no need to clarify the headline, because the headline is clear."
Seriously you can't make the thread here without making it clear and upfront the allegations aren't about Ben Simmons.
So it‚Äôs not Ben Simmons but his brother am I right ? Either way hope the lady gets the justice she deserves
Players in the twilight of their career like CP3 always tend to get a little more love thrown their way.  Ben Simmons has higher expectations and people are going to have to accept that. 15/8/7 with solid defense is great but his expectation level is that of Lebrons and for a lot of people he has not met those expectations.
Ben Simmons ( yeah I know this joke is dead and burried).
Ben Simmons
"Philly without Ben Simmons, Milwaukee when they were the 8th seed and Toronto last year. Not very impressive. Like I said, the future looks pretty grim for the Celtics, but if you're happy with what you're seeing then more power to you I guess."
"I, just like you, roll my eyes at the hot takes of the casuals. However I don‚Äôt think being upset about Simmons‚Äô offensive limitations is crazy to call out, even if you just started watching in 2018.   I agree that those of us who endured the *actual* process (Isaiah Canaan, Hollis Thompson, Henry Sims) don‚Äôt wanna hear some WIP caller saying Simmons stinks and needs to go for a bag of basketballs. Yet, on the other end or the spectrum, I cannot stand the Simmons stans who are Simmons fans first, Sixers fans second, who have the gall to scoff at a Simmons-Harden swap and talked about Harden as if he‚Äôs washed up garbage. No, I did not want to massively overpay and leave our roster‚Äôs depth and future draft pick cupboard in shambles, but the free passes Simmons gets and the pedestal he‚Äôs placed on with a sect of fanboys is nauseating.   This season has been refreshing and I‚Äôve held my tongue on Ben because when healthy we are right there at the top of the conference. But the 2021 Playoffs are for me at least, his last chance at showing he can be our second best player who will help lead us to true contention in the foreseeable future. If how teams exposed him in the ‚Äò18 and ‚Äò19  runs becomes more of the same in ‚Äò21, you have to sell and go in a different direction. Clearly the type of player he is and chooses to be would be limiting the team‚Äôs potential."
is wiseman today's ben simmons?
"I know that. I am a Mavs fan, and I am a pessimist. Also the Jazz don't have a Ben Simmons that can guard Luka like the Sixers do."
"Criticism from a philly flair..  I love the regular season. Those who know (fans of contenders) are vastly outnumbered by those who don't (fans of pretenders)  You guys are like a zombie horde that just keep coming. It's not until playoffs when you get exposed do the herds thin out a bit.  Enjoy. Downvote me. Those who think Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid are going to lead the Sixers over a Nets team with championship pedigree keep upvoting this guy. I'm doing a public service for you guys, keep smoking that hopium.  Just don't bet any money on the Sixers"
"Sure, but right under the monthly Ben Simmons debate"
"First, there is an implied assumption that Anthony Edwards, specifically, will need to shoot a lot better to become an all-star. I think that's a fact; he's not Sabonis, Giannis, or Ben Simmons.   Second, you're absolutely right that the big limitation of this analysis is the lack of consideration of volume. Obviously, shooting 37% on five attempts per game is more impressive (and likely requires a ""better"" shooter) than shooting 39% on two attempts per game."
Good point. Just I'm used to calling Ben Simmons a Simmons and Shaquille O'Neal a Shaq. That's why I chose it.
"Ever seen someone get hit by a truck?   Yeah that's gonna be nothing compared to this. If Campazzo can floor Ben Simmons, Brown is gonna look like a train wreck."
*Ben Simmons/Malcolm Brogdon didn‚Äôt like that*
I have no idea what you're talking about. I just came into a random thread about the celtics and I once again found someone shitting on Ben Simmons for no reason
"I mean not really, we're the one seed in the East and everyone is playing well. It's not really Doc's fault that Simmons can't play with Howard and that after the trade Howard is the only center on the roster that's not Embiid.   But Harris is having a career year, Curry and Green are shooting well from deep, and Embiid is having an MVP calibur season. Ben is facilitating the offense. Can't have everyone scoring 20+"
"Why do you view blocking as an afterthought, like it's the least valuable form of a defense? The criticism is always that he blocks well, but doesn't defend well in the post.   Well I say Ben Simmons doesn't block well. So why is he in consideration?  At the end of the day, there are different techniques for preventing the ball to go in the hoop. If that's what happens, why does the specific technique matter?"
Ben Simmons  Nephews might start focusing on his DPOY candidate defense or elite playmaking if they could just STFU about his shooting FOR FIVE MINUTES
"Kevin Durant, Gary payton, and Ben Simmons"
"Fair enough. I‚Äôm not here to shame anyone who is ESL. But it‚Äôs definitely true that you have a propensity to talk shit about the Sixers and, more specifically, Ben Simmons. Even if I did take the time to go through your posts/comments, I‚Äôm willing to bet some of the more egregious things you said have been deleted by now. You just have a very recognizable username and I see you consistently in threads about the Sixers/Ben."
You think it‚Äôs more likely that Ben Simmons accidentally live streamed a private meeting and was timing out people who were asking questions about what he was doing? You do you I guess.
"&gt; Like Ben Simmons obviously pretty much exclusively takes shots at the rim, but he's pretty bad at getting fouled. He doesn't sell contact well at all.  Yeah Simmons and Harris both have a tendency to float away from the contact when they drive instead of going through the guys chest. Really hurts their chances of drawing fouls."
"Yeah, selling calls is a skill. Guys like him and Harden have mastered it.  Guys like them aren't getting more calls just because they may drive or post-up more. They know how and when to create/bait contact and how to sell it.   Like Ben Simmons obviously pretty much exclusively takes shots at the rim, but he's pretty bad at getting fouled. He doesn't sell contact well at all."
The guy you‚Äôre responding to has a hate boner for Simmons. He makes backhanded comments about Ben and the Sixers allllll the time.
"If your post has Ben Simmons‚Äô name in it, u/KD-is-not-a-snake is in the comments throwing shade. Dude has to have notifications set up for any post that mentions ‚ÄúBen Simmons‚Äù because he is in every thread, without exception"
"Ben Simmons overrated. Jrue definitely bought a VPN and protected his account, unlike ‚ÄúDPOY‚Äù Benny 1 Point who can‚Äôt even protect his Twitch account"
Ben Simmons is THE most oppressed basketball player in the league
"Tatum swept the sixers at age 22. At age 22 embiid was being gentleman‚Äôs swept in the first round. He still has years to go before he hits his prime.  Kembas contract is about a pick away from being moved.  Idk where ‚Äúainge doesn‚Äôt make trades‚Äù comes from given that he traded for a 20 ppg scorer 2 weeks ago.   You have an mvp ‚Äúcandidate‚Äù and Ben Simmons is a glorified role player who can‚Äôt take anything but layups at a mediocre rate. Being a second round exit is going to be embiids career highlight on the sixers squad.   I must have hit a nerve, because you are coping insanely hard instead of blocking me like you claimed.  It‚Äôs ok, maybe the sixers will make it past the second round of the playoffs after the next tankjob."
"Ben Simmons is one of my favorite players in the league, but what you just described (outside of the double clutch) is a fairly standard reverse layup. It was incredibly impressive, but it's not a circus shot."

You have 1 star or 2 stars that don‚Äôt fit particularly well? Your other 3 players NEED to fit above all. Celtics could use a Rondo or a Ben Simmons or something like that and just play Tatum and Brown more like 2‚Äôs.
ben simmons is a great playmaker
I'm a 3pt specialist so Ben Simmons  Shaq on Free Throws
Embiid has simmons who is a black hole on offense and constantly forces 3 guys in the paint fouling joel... we have seen this year where 4 guys were defending joel lol... now imagine if joel had murray and the nuggets had ben simmons???????????? jokic would retire.
one lives in the paint and leads in paint points year after year along with paint fg pct and is double and triple teamed everytime they touch the ball while playing with ben simmons who nobody guards.... the other is jokic.
because he is... imagine jokic playing with ben simmons a guy that the other team doesnt even cover and forces doubles and triple teams on jokic daily? It would be awful for jokic playing with another center in sommons.
"I don't agree with that assessment at all. Ben Simmons is an exceptional finisher and playmaker and he'd be hot garbage in several of the systems used around the league. Let me also reiterate that I'm not saying LeBron would be bad in any of those systems. He just wouldn't be as good as he is when he's allowed to basically make the system in his own image. Regardless of what system the rest of the team he's on plays, he plays LeBron. He doesn't play a role, he plays himself. That's not really fitting into a system, that's overriding the system by shear talent alone which is something he can get away being(like I called him earlier) the greatest player of his generation."
Ben Simmons range but not as pretty.
Ben Simmons sucks
"This is the best that the sixers will ever be. Embiid is in his absolute prime.   They are the third best team in the east.   Tatum is 23 and has more potential than anyone on the sixers roster.   Brown makes Ben Simmons look like a CBA player.   They are absolutely in a better position moving forward. And given how ainge has finessed the sixers front office multiple times, I would hold off with coping about GMs."
"i've seen this man receive the ball under the rim with no one within 10ft of him and instead of taking the easiest 2pts of the game, he straight up circled and head out away from the net to look for a pass.  ben simmons deserves to be memed on"
He had a good series against Philly the first time. He won‚Äôt if he ever meets Simmons again in the playoffs. Ben is a way better defender now
"Casuals saying it‚Äôs a reverse layup smh. 6‚Äô10‚Äù dude goes full sprint to airborne, ducks the blocker, switches hands mid air, backspins it off the glass. Ben Simmons = Jelly fam"
It went from Jokic posts to Ben Simmons now Tatum posts
Ben simmons obviously. Kinda question is this
Just get back at them by posting a Ben Simmons stat line during a Playoffs.
"&gt; circumstances can lull teams into a false sense of security  One key thing is they had a transition this offseason in terms of GM/Coach with Morey/Rivers. Think there are two possibilities for them not pushing enough to ultimately get either Lowry/Harden  a) Both Daryl/Doc just came from high pressure win now situations. They wanted a year to just breathe, gauge the situation for themselves, and not be in a rush to accelerate their timeline and put themselves in another win now high pressure type situation.   b) Other one I find kind of interesting is that Morey privately isnt as high on their team as the fans and others are. Hence he doesnt think this is the team or year to push all his chips in and make win now moves.   Overall agree though this roster as is isnt good enough to win a title. I also think there's a good chance this ends up being the best yr of Embiid's career and that realistically you are only looking at a 3-4 yr window with him. Way too many medical issues for me to be willing to count on him still being a blue chip guy after 30.   &gt;an underrated key need for their team  Yeah tbh theyve always wanted/needed a true PG to play with Ben that was the plan with Fultz. In some ways I think their total lack of playmaking beyond Simmons is sometimes a bigger issue than half court shot creation."
Ben Simmons' 3 point shot  Came here just to say that  Thanks
"Capela should be the guy in second for dpoy, not Ben Simmons."
Ben Simmons might be there this time
I fucking love this subs arc with Ben Simmons. He was loved his rookie season and was compared to the next LeBron/Magic and now there‚Äôs a ton of opinions on if he‚Äôs a player that can help Embiid win a championship
"i was exaggerating, but his jump shot is really his only glaring problem, your comment pokes holes in mine rightfully but it doesn‚Äôt dismiss the point, Ben Simmons is an elite defender, elite playmaker, and an above average finisher, he‚Äôs 6‚Äù10 and in the action a lot so rebounding isn‚Äôt a problem, and in all honesty his form looks fine when he takes them. i‚Äôm not saying lacking the most common skill in the league isnt a bad thing but even everything you said wouldn‚Äôt be too bad of a criticism if he played Power Forward or Center. him starting at the 1 is the only reason he gets singled out for it   shit if Russell Westbrook was 6‚Äù10 he‚Äôd probably get a pass entirely because at least he could make them at one point"
How is Ben Simmons getting to the basket when the paint is packed
"yea, they'll leave Ben Simmons wide open under the basket, for sure my dude"
"They are a Rockets fan.   And anything you are missing with Ben Simmons, Embiid easily makes up for."
By doubling him and leaving Ben Simmons wide open
Holy shit nugget fans are unbearable. We can play this same game with Ben Simmons but we don‚Äôt complain nearly as much as y‚Äôall.
"Ben Simmons is a galactic being, he will never retire OR die"
Bold of you to assume Ben Simmons will die
"Danny Green is so fucking good man. Also, looks like Ben Simmons remembered how to finish"
kemba still winless against ben simmons
"Doc has been a blessing. He is certainly not without flaw, and I am uncertain about his game plan regarding Ben Simmons, but our team has looked better across the board this season and I really enjoy seeing our guys with much better defined rolls"
"Hey guys, my house is flooding right now and my dog is trying to eat my cat, do you think Ben Simmons is overrated?"
Ben Simmons is a +17 rn  Jaylen Brown is a -17  You‚Äôre getting beat down by the 76ers right now have some shame.
"I love Ben Simmons, but I‚Äôd take Tatum over him."
Ben Simmons üò§ (tho this may not be true I haven‚Äôt watched tonight‚Äôs game yet lol)
Jrue can do that. So the question still remains what is it that puts ben Simmons above Jrue?
"To be fair, Ben Simmons might end up being a problem in the East"
"Yes Ben Simmons is a great defender, but so is Brown. The slight advantage Simmons has in defense is outweighed by the fact that he doesn‚Äôt bring much value to halfcourt offense"
Ben Simmons is my problem!
How can the only thing Ben Simmons is good at offensively be slept on?
Reminder that Ben Simmons has never lost to Kemba Walker
what if we didn't post about Ben simmons every 9 minutes
I had no idea people thought Jrue was better than Ben Simmons lmao
"Anybody who says Ben Simmons is better than Jaylen Brown is wrong  ‚ÄúB...B....But his defense!!!‚Äù Yes Ben Simmons is a great defender, but so is Brown. The slight advantage Simmons has in defense is outweighed by the fact that he doesn‚Äôt bring much value to halfcourt offense"
I should play the Ben Simmons role
"I can't describe how good his shooting and off-ball movement is, given he's the GOAT in both aspects, especially after you compare him to Joe Harris of all people lmfao, is this really the hill you're dying on.   It's like if someone asked me what's the difference between Ben Simmons' passing and BBIQ and LeBron's, it's just a hilarious comparison. Why would I spend time typing up an essay for something that should be easily understandable if they just actually watched him over the last few years?  If you don't understand why Curry is considered one of the top players, make a Reddit thread about it, I'm sure they'll humor you."
"People saying their defense is equal are just wrong. Jrue is a fantastic guard defender but he‚Äôs not locking up bigger perimeter guys who can handle and create their own shots. Luka cooks Jrue when they play. Ben Simmons on the other hand is able to defend those players well, in addition to guards. Now the bucks don‚Äôt need that from Jrue because they‚Äôve got Giannis so he‚Äôs a much better fit for them."
Ben Simmons is an all-nba level player. Jrue is a career 16/6 who made one all star team.
"They needed to pull the trigger on either the Lowry or Harden deal.   I think circumstances can lull teams into a false sense of security (see Boston after the 2018 run).   I think Ben being injured last post-season let them dodge hard questions about his postseason fit and then this season they started off so strong they ended up too confident in their roster.  When the Harden/Lowry deals were on the table, guys were playing really well. Now we're looking at the team having the same struggles they've always had.      1. Tobi is playing well within his role but hasn't shown he can handle the bigger role they'll need him to take on 2. Seth's shooting/scoring has regressed back to his averages (down from 17ppg to 12ppg) - Plus, this is Philly's worst year in terms of 3P% and offensive rating 3. Ben had his annual 1-month of being aggressive and is back to playing far too passively 4. Embiid has looked amazing for the season but he'll be finishing the season coming off an injury (again)   &gt;But really biggest issue is his playmaking and processing is still too limited. Doesnt play super fast, holds the ball, and even if his assists are up doesnt see the court well at all.   I love the George Hill pickup for Philly, he's probably the best backup PG they've ever had (an underrated key need for their team), but they really needed Lowry.  A PG rotation of Lowry, Simmons, Hill was obtainable and would have been incredible for their playoff chances."
You can trust them both out there defensively in any playoff series so coaches love them both.     Jrue is having a good shooting season but he‚Äôs not an elite shooter IMO. I bet teams leave him open in the playoffs. He‚Äôs definitely an upgrade handling the ball and a willing shooter.    Ben Simmons‚Äô playmaking gets slept on. He‚Äôs an incredible passer and has been playing that dunker spot finisher/outlet passer to perfection with more shooting this season.
"It's not a Jrue vs. Simmons thing. It's a ""/r/nba is obsessed with Ben Simmons"" thing"
Instead Embiid will be doubled team the whole game as Ben Simmons sits on the 3 point line without a defender in sight
People saying he is better than Ben Simmons now. That's all I took from it.
"Court vision. Such an incredibly rare talent in a league that is dominated by guys wanting to iso and chuck all day. Jrue Holliday has good court vision, however Ben Simmons‚Äô is otherworldly."
Ben Simmons needs to take off his wrist weights.
"You are probably right and I know what you are trying to say but as good as Westbrook is, Harden is literally a level or two above Westbrook. But Ben Simmons is good enough to lock down  superstars so the Nets will be left with one superstar and that's not enough to get past a well constructed roster like Philly"
"Dont be so hard on yourself. You know things we dont so its a give and take. I will say be weary of this sub if you are beginner because at times it can seem like only 5-6 teams matter and it comes and goes in waves. Understandably as those are the best teams (jazz, Suns, 76ers, Nuggets)  or teams with one of the best players (Mavs, Blazers)  Your best bet is watching as many games as you can and if you cant catch a game just go to Youtube and get the condensed version of the game. The more you ingest of that the more you'll learn players tendencies and capabilities. Also theres thousands upon thousands of highlight tapes of old players on youtube as well.   The thing I really like about the NBA is there are 10-15-20 elite guys (depending who you ask) but each guy has their own way of being effective and elite. Ben Simmons is a great example. Guy is 100% elite but cant shoot the ball worth a lick so check out some youtube highlights and you'll see how an Elite NBA player that cant shoot is so dominate (basically does everything else at an elite level besides shooting).   [https://www.basketball-reference.com/](https://www.basketball-reference.com/)  This site is basically a basketball bible if you wanna deep dive into stats. Also this is good for beginners so you can check who leads the league in whatever category and going back to the youtube thing, and check out their highlights or you can just type in ""Draymond Green Defensive highlights"" and you'll be able to see the things he does well.    I've been a 2k player for many years. Recently gave it up because gameplay sucked ass and its not realistic. I could see the benefits for a beginner from a roster standpoint but I do not recommend this method. Really not at all how real basketball is played."
"If you think thats the defense Zion gonna get in the playoffs you in for a surprise. It will be a double and someone standing at the rim too. They will also try and give him space at the 3 aka Ben Simmons,Westbrok treatment."
Where can I use my Ben Simmons currency üí∑
&gt;Jokic has been better than Embiid this season  Cap. Plus Jokic has a stacked team. Embiid has been carrying Ben Simmons‚Äô broken ass to the 1 seed.
"He's not a superstar. He's an All Star, amazing young talent, top five defender and probably the best perimeter defender in the league. He's also a top five passer in the league most seasons, easily top ten.   But he's not a superstar. Idk why he keeps getting compared to players who are all in their prime, and who have won MVPs. Giannis was not the player he is now in his fourth year. And Ben may never get to that point. Same with Westbrook.   Honestly I love Ben and have high hopes for him, but I have no idea why he gets discussed this much. He's not a superstar like a Harden, or Embiid, or LeBron. He's a star sure, but he gets discussed like a superstar and it's wild. Every player has to be compared to him for some reason. Even when the two players don't even play the same position. We have to have these ""what's wrong with Ben Simmons"" topics ad nauseam every damn day.   The truth is there are *many* young players who have not grown aspects of their games. But they generally take more shots as they get more experience and so their counting numbers go up. But they haven't improved their defense, or playmaking, or rebounding. But Simmons' issue is shooting which is more visible."
"&gt; teams have tried the weirdest things to guard Russ. &gt; Gobert, AD, Bam have guarded Russ. When was the last time a point guard was guarded by a center?  Not that weird. He‚Äôs been a sub 30% 3pt shooter, struggling from the FT line, and played with a center who couldn‚Äôt shoot. Why wouldn‚Äôt you drop a center on that? We‚Äôve seen the same thing with other ball handlers like demar and Ben Simmons."
"26% 3pt shooting is pretty bad. I‚Äôm not saying he should go full Ben Simmons, but shooting fewer threes might be a good idea for him."
"Suns &gt; Sixers. They might be inexperienced but they have a much higher BBIQ leader in CP3 and a game that translates way better to the playoffs because neither of their primary scorers is hyper-vulnerable to doubles and they‚Äôre good at scoring at all 3 levels, especially tough midrange shots that are really common in the playoffs. The Sixers still have some unresolved playoff questions with the Simmons-Joel core, especially Joel‚Äôs vulnerability to doubles (Philly has a 97.7 ORTG when he‚Äôs hard doubled in the post this year which is really bad, esp with how reliant their offense is on his post scoring), and how they keep the offense from becoming a 4v5 when Ben doesn‚Äôt have the ball, which just makes it that much easier for teams to double Embiid. Probably at least one of Tobias/Green is gonna have to be hot for them, and both of those guys are risky streaky."
"Ben Simmons, TJ McConnell, Matisse Thybulle, Dario Saric, Joel Embiid"
If I could be an nba player I think I‚Äôd be Ben Simmons.  No pressure to score. Freak of nature athlete. 6ft 10. Raw as fuck on defense and transition. Great vision and lateral quickness.   He just plays a fun and explosive style.
"The amount of times I see actually brain dead Sixers fans say this, but then all the time complain about not having Ben Simmons is actually mind blowing. How could a fan base be so unaware and actually say this shit on a public forum?!"
Ben Simmons will never
BEN SIMMONS WOULD NEVER
Ben Simmons liked that
"Ben Simmons is back.   Half kidding, the Thunder‚Äôs youth really showed tonight."
Ben Simmons effect
Ben Simmons getting ready to post a pic of this on his instagram later with a the caption saying ‚Äúüîíüò§‚Äù
Imagine comparing Kyrie Irving to Ben Simmons. Absolutely disrespectful to Kyrie
I love Ben Simmons but what he said about Rudy rubbed me the wrong way. Since when was Rudy an individual defender. When did he guard him? This guy is leading his team to the one seed and is an all time great defensive player and I haven't heard many players give him credit. I think even Finney Smith was talking shit about him. Do these dudes not know about team defence? No they clearly do but they are going out of their way to shit on him and it disgusts me.
Ben Simmons will pay for this transgression

"I somewhat agree but it‚Äôs a really complex issue.   Hypothetically, let‚Äôs imagine there are two of the exact same play with a different offensive player.  Imagine the defence applies the exact same contact on each play.   Player 1 Kyrie Irving drives gets the contact and falls to the ground - ref calls foul, no complaints   Player 2 Ben Simmons drives gets the contact doesn‚Äôt fall to the ground - ref calls no foul.   Do you believe a foul should be determined by the level of contact by the defender (which would mean both players should have a foul called) or should it be determined by how much the contact effects the offensive player (player 1 gets the call, player 2 does not.   I‚Äôd be interested to know what everyone thinks."
If Ben Simmons made one more 3 every 10th game I'd be blown away by his progress.
"&gt; I have to go out of my way to send articles and find stats and you throw it out the window with ""I don't like that answer, give better one"" and I find more stats and you say the same thing. Explain and give evidence, or don't come at all.   What stats? You haven't cited any stats to support your claim that you have 4 all star calliber players. I have given evidence. That only one of those players has actually made a team is a fact that I have provided. If they were all-star caliber, it's reasonable to expect them to have, you know, made the team. 0 All-nba is also a fact. I'm giving you facts, so stop complaining that I'm not.  &gt; Pacers v Cavs 2017. Only team to take LeBron to 7 in the first round. It got got decided by bad officiating, especially the awful goaltending decision.   Boy, I'm glad you brought this up. I think you mean 2018? 2017 you were swept by the cavs. But in 2018 Oladipo made an all-nba team and was playing at an elite level (as I mentioned above). It proves that if you give Nate McMillan elite talent, he can win some playoff games. Of course, Oladipo wasn't the same after his injury, which sucks.   &gt; Literally last year.   I meant top 4 roster talent, not seeding.   &gt; I could go back but that's not modern. It's hard to just fling out examples, because yet again, I have to spend time sifting through stats, articles, etc. as well as dealing with subjective opinions to satisfy you. Unless you expect me to know the history and players of every single franchise for the last 15 years or so off the top of my head, you can't keep demanding when you haven't given me anything back.   I thought this was a fairly straightforward point and the fact that you struggled to come up with examples off the top of your head, I think says something. But since you are asking, let's look at the past three years of second round teams and see how many had All-NBA selections:  2020  Bucks (Giannis), Raptors (Siakam), Heat (Butler), Celtics (Tatum), Lakers (Lebron, Davis), Nuggets (Jokic), Clippers (Kawhi), Rockets (Westbrook, Harden)  Kemba, PG, and Lowry have also been selected in previous years.   All 8 teams had an all-nba selection.  2019  Bucks (Giannis), Raptors (Kawhi), Celtics (Kyrie), Sixers (Embiid), Warriors (Curry, Durant), Blazers (Lillard), Rockets (Harden), Nuggets (Jokic)  Off the top of my head I believe Klay Thompson and CP3 have prior selections, and Ben Simmons would be selected the next year.  8/8 again.  2018  Cavs (Lebron), Raptors (DeRozan), Sixers (Embiid), Celtics (0!), Warriors (Durant, Curry), Rockets (Harden), Pelicans (Davis), Utah (0!).  So it was only 6/8 in 2018. But and this is big but in my opinion, Utah and Boston had future all-nba selections in Gobert and Tatum, also Mitchell seems inevitable at some point.   So, I think this shows that while certainly not impossible, it is extremely difficult (2 for 24 in the last three years) to make the second round without elite talent. Even in the 2 cases where teams advanced without it, they had future selections on the roster. Certainly possible that Indiana has a breakout from one of their guys in the years ahead, but I just don't think they've really shown enough yet to expect them to carry you to playoff wins against a team like Miami at least as of last year.  &gt; I don't think I came across like that, I just think that you've been exposed to a different philosophy and culture, and that's why you probably won't understand. You guys draft your way to victory, and this is what we're seeing again. Pacers have almost always made good trades and developed those players to All-Star level.   You called me spoiled. I just wrote you a long paragraph on how the Pacers can find elite players either in the middle of the draft or through trade and gave PG and Oladipo (even if it didn't last with him) as examples. Where exactly is my bias? ""Oh your team has had elite players, so of course you think that's needed."" Totally unfair given that I've just shown you three years of evidence (that was really easy to think through btw). I'm 100% not saying the Pacers are stuck in the middle or need to blow up or tank. I just think they have lacked elite talent on the roster outside of the 1 year of Oladipo over the McMillan era. So, it's absurd to point to his playoff performance and call him a regular season coach given this lack of top end talent. My argument is keep McMillan and keep after it and eventually you get that elite guy and boom yay you have a good coach.   And fine, if we're going there, you have a biased perspective because you are a PACERS FAN. You are so close to the topic. Gee do you think it's possible that as a fan, you might be overrating your players a bit? Of course. Of course you think ""if we just modernize the offense we will be an elite team in the East,"" because that's a more positive thought then the reality which is that you will probably be doing good to make the playoffs until you get or develop an elite player. I wasn't gonna go there, but evidently that's on the table."
"Hey Jayson! Can you adopt the nickname ""Tater""? It fits with your last name and the options for people commenting on your highlights would be immense!   You could even dunk on someone like Ben Simmons and look him dead in the eye and say, ""Jayson with another TATER""   If your kids make it to the NBA, you'll have Tater Tots!   All told, I'm glad I convinced you to use it."
You can say the same thing about Ben Simmons and Steph
"I think Zion can develop a decent 3pt shot in the future, he won't be like Ben Simmons"
"Ty Lawson used to shitpost on here back in the day. Ben Simmons draft class did an Ama together here, I'm sure a couple stuck around."
if Ben Simmons was a rookie so is this guy
"Uh no. Draymond played with 3 of the greatest shooters of all time who can all create their own shot. Hell, there were even series were draymond shot an insane percentage from 3. Ben Simmons is not doing that nor does he have that luxury."
"Lol OK then, please explain to me why Ben simmons has your trust in the playoffs when he turns into Tony Allen with a handle"
Whats it like having Ben Simmons as a Father?
There are a lot of ‚Äúwhat if‚Äôs‚Äù. Like what if the Bucks drafted Embiid at #2 instead of Jabari Parker and letting the Sixers get Embiid at #3.   What if Porzingis had taken any of the Pre Draft meetings with Philly.   Hinkie had been rumored to want Porzingis over Okafor since before the draft but Porzingis refused to meet with them since they were still in the early years of ‚ÄúThe Process‚Äù.   At the end of the day even with Phil Jackson rumored to want to trade up 1 spot for Okafor (since he was a viewed as a great ‚ÄúTriangle‚Äù fit) Hinkie was pressured by ownership to take the more popular homegrown talent instead of taking a risk on a Euro.   I believe the Sixers still had Noel so maybe the front court combo would have made their record too good to get the #1 pick of Ben Simmons.   To be fair Pre Draft there was a lot of worries about Porzingis‚Äô back and overall health because of his size and suffering from Anemia.
*Ben simmons
"You would be stupid not to see his game has evolved. 3 years ago he would never take a three. Now he‚Äôs shooting them good enough that the defense has to have some respect. Not steph curry respect, but not ben simmons either"
Dude. Rockets only accepted that trade because Harden wanted to go there. Its not like they didn't want Ben Simmons in return. It was just a thank you to Harden for spending 8 years with the franchise. You're kidding yourself if you see it as anything else.
We have embiid and only Ben Simmons defence
Even ben simmons makes a 3 sometimes smh
KD is less of a mismatch for Ben Simmons than Embiid is for Blake Griffin.
Because all 3 of your examples aren‚Äôt mismatches at all especially ben simmons and jrue holiday who would have to be almost the best options in the league to guard said players
"Sixer's no doubt.  Embiid is great but Minnesota is built on mobility and he wouldn't really fit in that style.  Meanwhile KAT is the best 3p shooting big man, and they already have Seth and Danny Green. So having that kind of space inside would definitely help Ben Simmons thrive on drives to the rim. I think the synergy clearly tilts on the Sixer's side."
&gt;*a DPOY candidate that can switch 1-5*  Ben Simmons is kind of a fun weird player to bring up all these debates about.  \- He's a top-shelf defender.  \- Defense is more important than ever because offensive players are becoming absolutely ridiculous.   Almost every team has one dude who is almost entirely unguardable nowadays and Jrue Holidays/Ben Simmons don't grow on trees.
nowadays we call Ben Simmons a coward for not letting it fly
Trade Ben Simmons? Would y‚Äôall do that?
2 Ben Simmons. More versatility. Simmons can guard C‚Äôs and PG‚Äôs. Embiid can only guard C‚Äôs.
"Knicks can absolutely beat the Bucks in a 7-game series if they end up playing them. I wouldn‚Äôt bet on it, but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôd be like a 25% chance.  Oh, and Bill Russell &gt; Wilt. Bill was miles ahead of anybody defensively and for all the talks of inefficient and poor offensive basketball, he always was around league average or slightly above efficiency wise and in terms of his passing is actually a lot better than people think. Dude was consistently in the top 15 each season for assists per game, even getting as high as 5th, for the entirety of the 60‚Äôs. Comparatively in today‚Äôs NBA that‚Äôs somewhere in between where Jokic/Ben Simmons/Giannis are ranked. Combine that with 11 rings as the leader of your team and consistently being first/second offensive option... I think he was a bigger positive for his team than Wilt was and that‚Äôs the definition of quality for a basketball player"
"None of those guys are really A tier prospects.   I‚Äôd argue that every one of these teams has a better young core than the Knicks.  Pelicans, mavs (just luka really), Celtics grizzlies, hawks, nuggets, wolves, kings, thunder, heat, sixers (if you count Ben Simmons), cavs.  Is it really a ‚Äúgood young core‚Äù if half the non-contenders in the league have a better young core than you?  I don‚Äôt really think so. If it wasn‚Äôt an NYC team, they would be just another mediocre squad."
Ben Simmons ultimate D holding Kyrie under 40
Does Ben Simmons not have an uncle or aunt?
Ben Simmons is a nephew?
Ben Simmons is today‚Äôs Bill Russell.
"if wolves keep their pick this year, trade d lo, okogie, and the pick for ben simmons, 76ers - Wolves finals. just as a neutral fan i'd like to see that series of events in particular"
To think Ben Simmons chooses to go through this every year.
"Lol no wonder his defense is so bad, he probably thinks Ben Simmons can shoot"
"""You talk a lotta shit for being ass"" - Ben Simmons"
"Is it? What would this Lakers team be without Lebron? You swap him for Khris Middleton, Ben Simmons, or Jamal Murray and the Lakers are an 8th seed. And that's if AD stays healthy all year..."
Out of current players.   1. Ben Simmons   2. KD  3. Kyrie   4. Dame   5. Doncic
*Looks at every team around the league dealing with unprecedented levels of injuries*  Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid are not durable
Whats the point of 2 embiids lol theirs only 1 rim but most contenders have multiple perimeter threats so give me 2 Ben Simmons
"Have you watched any game this season when Ben and Embiid played (which neither did yesterday)?  The Sixers, like any other team, don‚Äôt have a reasonable chance of winning in the playoffs when their two best players aren't playing so I‚Äôm not really worried about how Tobi‚Äôs offense looked yesterday.   Also, he‚Äôs been a significantly better fit in Doc‚Äôs scheme than Brett Browns but, again, part of that relies on the impact of Simmons and Embiid."
Where are you from? Your username may indicate that you might want to watch Philadelphia. They have an MVP caliber player in Embiid and all-star Ben Simmons
"A bank teller and an nba player are two completely different things lmao that was a shitty comparison.   Whether or not you like the answer, the fact remains that Draymond is not paid to be a scorer, but to be an elite defensive player and elite playmaker.   Yes they will get excuses for their lackluster performance if they can make up for it, and Draymond clearly does that.   Shooting 10000 shots a day in a gym isn't going to suddenly make Draymond or any player for that matter somehow an elite shooter.   Ben Simmons can't shoot yet he contributes a lot to his team's success in winning. Do you know why? Because he plays a different style to basketball than other players. It's called fitting into a system better than other players.   Shaq couldn't shoot well either yet he was the reason why many of the teams he was in won chips. Charles Barkley is in the same boat (except without the chip part).   You can't write off a player as ""overrated"" or ""overpaid"" just because he doesn't live up to YOUR expectations.   Let me ask you this. Do you even watch the Warriors games? Or do you just believe what every casual has to say about Draymond?"
"I mean they aren't getting past the 2nd round with Ben fucking Simmons as their third best player. Hopefully Joel stays healthy, Tobias does what he does and IcyHot gets HOT."
I know your not talking about Joel Part-Time Embiid and Ben I can't make a fucking shot Simmons
Exactly! I don't think people appreciate just how good an actual contender's bench is. Look at all the Lakers have been able to accomplish without LeBron and AD. Or when Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons sit for Philly. We've seen what happens when Steph and Draymond are out. This team is hardly functional. Sure Steph is getting older but he can't win without a great bench and role players around him. It takes time to make a good bench and get them on the same page. Why not develop Wiseman during that time?
"&gt;Wow, a 14 year old Redditor is telling me Ben Simmons isn‚Äôt committed to the game  and you're a 13 year old Redditor who thinks Ben Simmons is a mid-range jumper away from being LeBron James."
" &gt;Commitment to the game  Wow, a 14 year old Redditor is telling me Ben Simmons isn‚Äôt committed to the game"
Steph Curry and Ben Simmons
"Look at any Ben Simmons thread, there‚Äôll be countless people shitting all over him. I agree that it doesn‚Äôt make sense, but those people do exist."
Ben Simmons is baby
Good tell me who you think you can trade Ben Simmons for since you value him so high
The Sixers wouldn't want picks cause theyre trying to contend. They'd never trade Simmons for Mccollum cause CJ is nowhere near ben as a player and he has a garbage contract.
"Well Ben and Joel are both young and the pieces around them are under contract. Also Harris is not old either. So they probably realize that they had a great season and try again next year?   I'm not trying to be flippant but everyone thinks losing in the playoffs means the roster has to significantly change. That's not always the case. Last year's team was not well suited for either of the team's best players. This year's is. So we don't throw the good out with the bad, we work on what caused us to lose before the ECF and we try to improve that.   No that doesn't mean we have to trade Ben Simmons."
Not if they fail in the Playoffs. Players Value decreases by a decent margin when Teams try to shake up their Rosters after disappointing Playoff. Which other Player do you think you can get for Ben Simmons who is better than CJ
"Yeah what are the sixers going to do this time? Lose in the second round again?  Embiid couldn‚Äôt get it done with reddick, butler, harris, Simmons and now he‚Äôs going to do it without jimmy and JJ?   Sixers fans need to accept that they basically handicapped their squad when they whiffed on jimmy and Ben Simmons decided that shooting wasn‚Äôt for him.  They need to stop starting beef with Milwaukee and start preparing jokes about process 2.0, which will be starting 3 years from now."
A player like Ben. If the Sixers flop in the Playoffs which is what this post is about I doubt CJs Trade Value is much worse than Simmons. Nobody is giving up their Franchise Player for Simmons and CJ is as good a Player you‚Äôd get in Return + maybe some picks because of the age
"Ben Simmons not doing it is probably the biggest indicator that this is an exceptional accomplishment.  Simmons has a very Russ profile, but MORE height.  And he can‚Äôt do it"
"Pretty horrible start to the game, considering Philly had Embiid and Simmons out. That being said, not really taking too much away from this game. Philly poses problems for the Bucks with their bench (tall athletic guards) so while it is always nice to beat the 76ers ; it‚Äôs a different team with Joel and Ben.  Gg either way."
I really expect at every beginning of a season for Ben Simmons to average a triple double. but nor Simmons nor Jokic nor Lebron nor Doncic nor Harden are doing this. it's fucking hard apparently and everyone just became so accustomed to it with Russ doing it at this rate that rarely anyone talks about it
"in which universe are then Russell's numbers? why is he the only one doing this? why hasn't Lebron ever done this? I really expected Ben Simmons to do something like this, but he's not and nobody but Westbrook is doing it  he's in a Monstars universe"
MCW obviously or andrew wiggins  but Ben Simmons deserves a shoutout for regressing in his career. big clap for Simmo the Slayer
Interestingly it‚Äôs also as many t‚Äôs as Ben Simmons has made 3s this entire season
"Gobert probably is the MVP of the Jazz this year but there have definitely been a number of national media guys asking why Mitchell was not getting MVP consideration as the best player on the team with the best record. If that same stuff was happening for Jamal Murray or Ben Simmons then that would really hurt the cases for Jokic and Embiid.   You don't hear Kawhi and CP3 getting MVP buzz for this same reason, because Paul George and Devin Booker can make the case that they've been more important to their team's success this year. It might be a minority of people who think that, but it's enough to knock them out of the MVP race. Like I said above, the same thing happened when Steph and KD were teammates.   There's just a big difference between how clear it is that Jokic and Embiid are the MVPs of their teams versus guys like Gobert, Kawhi and CP3 with their teams."
He‚Äôs a 6‚Äô4 Guard who averages 2ORB a game. The only other point guard with those numbers is Ben Simmons.
"Ad sitting out, lebron out, harden out, klay out, Trae out, lamello out, Jamal Murry out, embid played less games than lebron despite lebron being out for 4 weeks, Ben Simmons out, Lonzo out, wym other players are banged up and we not noticing?  Kawhi and Paul George loading managing.  Pat bev is out.  The spurs just got fined for sitting players and Toronto sat practically every single one of their starters last week.  When asked about it the coach pretty much said ""yeah idk why Kyle Lowry isn't playing.  I think he's tired.""    You're dumb af lol"
"Nah, he'd be doing same role as Ben Simmons."
Trade Kawhi to Philly for Ben Simmons. Only Ben can save Clipper nation.
"Back during Trae's rookie year, KAT and Simmons were live streaming together, and KAT said he had to hop off because he had a game the next day. Simmons told him he didn't need to because it was against the Hawks, then KAT proceeded to drop like 45 on us and win the game. I think it's that moment alone they fueled Trae's hatred of Ben Simmons."
From your least most to least likely to be forgotten:   Marc Gasol   Demar Derozan    Ben Simmons    Kyle Lowry    Damian Lillard
"In the playoffs they play better players.  The best players, stars, can score on anyone.  They can and will get theirs.   It's not fair to look only at Gobert in a vacuum without seeing how his peers stack up.  The greatest defenders still got cooked against Jordan.  But we don't discredit those defenders because their playoff series defensive numbers are worse from playing Jordan.  The best guards can, will, and should attack Gobert.  That's covered in the OP video.  But again that shouldn't diminish his value, at least as much as a lot of people seem to do.  Harden gonna get his against anyone.  Of course the Rockets should have pick n roll for a mismatch.  Either Harden scores or he can throw it to his big man teammate being defended by a guard.  The same goes to a degree with CP3 and Westbrook.   Jokic roasts everyone.  Can Ben Simmons stop him? Hell no.  But that's OK.  Could Giannis stop him??  If they can, why aren't they? Jokic roasts everyone."
You have no idea Tisse and Maxey weren‚Äôt offered  You‚Äôd flip Ben Simmons like you did Oladipo for a far better return  As well as 2-4 first rounders because Morey obviously wouldn‚Äôt hold up a Harden deal over that
Did you notice an outpouring of sympathy for the Sixers last year when they went into the playoffs without Ben Simmons?  Denver will get shit if it loses in round one. Jokic will be accused of underperforming in the playoffs just like Embiid is - even with good stats.   Don‚Äôt expect r/nba to be reasonable.
"Trae really must not like Ben Simmons, because it always seems like he wants to beat him 1on1"
"Honestly, am I? When is Ben Simmons supposed to be back and why is he out anyway? Hasn't he been out for a week now?   Many injuries from this season have been from playing too much but you also have injuries people had shortly after returning from either covid protocols or previous injury.   It seems like a lot of the top teams this season have huge injury question marks and until those players, including Ben Simmons, come back and look healthy for 2-3 games at least you can't be too confident."
Ben Simmons is a better player than Klay Thompson
I think missing the 2nd greatest shooter of all time is considerably more of a handicap than missing Ben Simmons
"In 2 years they will be dating, and the supermarket tabloids will be filled with cover stories about ""Lion,"" as they'll call them for short.  The distraction will be too much. Both will have prolonged slumps until they break up, while Ben Simmons will be widely regarded as the best player in the league after working out with Julius Randle and Lonzo Ball in the off-season and becoming a 40% three point shooter overnight."
"As I‚Äôve told you about 12 hours ago, I don‚Äôt care enough to bother having to justify why I think Ben Simmons is better this year with a random kid on the internet just because you want me to say something. If you can‚Äôt comprehend that, you have an issue."
Ben Simmons having one hell of a sickness
Definitely could use more Ben Simmons threads
"Let me save you all the effort since it‚Äôs almost the weekend and you could be spending your time doing something fun.    Dort better   Jokic MVP   Doc 3-1   Ben Simmons overrated   Embiid fat, milkshake, glass   Nets in 4   Tobias awful contract   SM bad   Snowballs at santa   Kawhi magnetic rim"
"Ben Simmons and Boris Diaw are point forwards,  intitatiors are players who you can run offense through in the halfcourt"
"But he's been playing the point the second half of this year? And again, I'd rather have an embiid level center to pair with Tatum than ben simmons with Tristan Thompson."
"What Murray did in playoffs last 2 years we will never get from Ben in the postseason. Give me Murray over Simmons any day of the week. He is not a bad defender himself and can get you 30 on a sick shooting splits any given night. He doesnt need to be playmaker, how do people not see this?!  If Ben was playing with Jokic, he wouldnt be getting this many assists himself"
"Andrei Kirilenko is always the first guy who pops into my head with this question. He was great in his time -- 3x All-Defense -- but Jerry Sloan constantly played him out of position as an SF next to two traditional bigs in Carlos Boozer and Mehmet Okur. Today, if used as a PF or small-ball C, I really think AK-47 would be a perennial DPOY candidate in the mold of Ben Simmons or a taller, more athletic Draymond Green."
Ben Simmons in shambles
"Lowe, Nekias Duncan and Steven Jones, KOC, Ben Taylor and most people from The Athletic   Bill Simmons and Rusillo as well"
Ben Simmons this year? Love to see it
"BuT Ben ""RotY"" Simmons cAn GuRrD 1-5!"
"Ben Simmons is incredible, it honestly bothers me sometimes how talented he is.  But the fact that anyone could be so delusional as to say his impact even comes close to Gobert's on the defensive end..."
"Please, Ben Simmons would never be willingly associated with the Wizards. His pride wouldn't let him stoop so low."
Can someone send this to Ben Simmons?
"Contradict meaning: To deny the truth of (a statement) by asserting the opposite.  The fact that you are calling Pascal an ass player, and using Ben Simmons, who has way worse shooting percentages than Pascal as an example of why he is an ""ass"" player, is in fact, contradictory.  (Im not discrediting Ben Simmons as a player.)  And Pascal does more than shoot 3's and do a couple spins."
Ben Simmons burner account spotted
Ben Simmons stays living in all 13 Utah fan's heads rent free
"going for Klay:      imo, a Shane Battier/Ron Artest type/Ben Simmons can replace Draymond's spot.  but I can't easily find a top caliber knockdown shooter with rock solid defense as Klay.  and the spacing is too essential to their system.      Draymond can be at his best game and they would still lose (like G7 2016). But Klay at his best can carry them over the top of adversity.      TL;DR: all thihgs being equal, great offense edges out great defense."
"Y‚Äôall had jimmy butler but I ain‚Äôt see him carry y‚Äôall to the finals, oh yeah cuz the rest of you‚Äôre team can‚Äôt do shit. Cry baby ass embiid, 14pts per game Ben Simmons üòÇüòÇ"
"The only point guard on the roster is Ben Simmons, who doesn‚Äôt shoot, so running the offense through him in the post is the most efficient way to use him. Was kinda hoping for Lonzo to give the team another point guard that can give that an option, think it would unlock the offense a lot. Not just for pick and roll but getting a point guard that an space the floor and use Ben as more of a screener/cutter would help the team a lot."
"Yes, exactly this. Same thing but different; I'm really not convinced Ben Simmons is the #1 DPOY, but I wouldn't put him anywhere except the top 3. You can make an argument that someone is better than someone else without dismissing the other guy, and that really seems to be lost on most of r/nba."
Ben simmons mad
&gt;ben simmons can hit jumpshots. he's just smart enough to not take them.  This doesn't make sense at all. I actually had a stroke reading this.
"I think the problem with Ben is that he doesn't have many stars comparison so you have to ""if"" and ""on"" a lot of possibilities: Simmons is a Michael Cooper on steroids without the shot. I know you need to do two concessions but for a dude as particular as Ben is not that bad."
"&gt; Switching into guards like Curry, Booker, Kyrie, etc. is still probably a bad idea because those guys are just unreal on the offensive end.  That applies to literally everyone in the league though.  Obviously you don't want him guarding guys like that all game long but he does *shockingly* well in short bursts.  Someone posted that clip of Devin Booker absolutely demolishing Gobert a week ago as proof that he doesn't deserve DPOY- the thing is, t[here are clips of him doing exactly the same thing to guys like Lu Dort and Ben Simmons and Bam/Jimmy Butler](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/5/12/22431989/nba-awards-ballot-mvp-nikola-jokic-joel-embiid) (scroll down to DPOY)."
"Awesome post  Now do one with ROTY, how many does ben simmons get then?"
&gt;he's ass. ben simmons repertoire featuring spin move. anyone who can stand straight up makes him inefficient. see jaylen brown absolute lockdown.    You call this criticism? Just seems like trolling to me
"Wtf are you even talking about? I agreed Caruso is a good defender but, I don't think he belongs among the best. What's your issue with that? The only ""controversial"" statement I made was that his advanced defenisve numbers don't represent his true value. Is he more valuable than Ben Simmons on defense? Obviously not. I swear you clowns are searching for conflict."
Ben Simmons is playing barely .500 Eastern Conference teams in the first rounds while the Jazz are playing teams with over or about 50 wins in the West.
ben simmons can hit jumpshots. he's just smart enough to not take them. pascal shoots 30% from 3 on 4.4 attempts with an EFG of 49.3.  oof.  maybe he should stop shooting them too.
i don't understand? care to elaborate why having ben simmons on the team i watch makes siakam immune to criticism?
A sixers fan saying this? When you got Ben Simmons on your team? Lmfao
[Embiid was 7/17 for 20 points](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203497/head-to-head/?sort=MATCHUP_FG_PCT&amp;dir=-1&amp;CF=MATCHUP*E*Joel%20Embiid) against Rudy as his primary defender and 7/10 for 20 vs other defenders. Considering Embiid's talent that's an excellent game from Rudy. [Simmons was 5/9 for 13 points](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203497/head-to-head/?sort=MATCHUP_FG_PCT&amp;dir=-1&amp;CF=MATCHUP*E*Ben%20Simmons) on Rudy. Those games both guys excelled against defenders outside of Rudy.  What I don't get about you guys is instead of giving your guy props for good games you have to shit on the other player. Why not just appreciate that your boys had great games against an elite defender instead of acting like you did it against a scrub. It's a weird look in my opinion.
&gt; ben simmons repertoire featuring spin move.¬†  Except siakam can actually hit a jumpshot
Also Ben Simmons was playing insane defense against him but it straight up didn‚Äôt matter. Just hit tough shot after tough shot
Ben Simmons has never lost in the first round.
You can't tell other people to watch games when you have Ben Simmons last on your list.
Because Ben Simmons is known for leading deep playoff runs..? Lol what
i feel bad for Sixers fans. Embiid potentially winning MVP was the closest thing to success they could have had in 20 years but now it's gone down the drain. now they're stuck gassing up tobias harris and ben simmons' nonexistent DPOY chances. sad times ahead
"This dude is 5ft10(mayyybe). 30 years old and a ""rookie"". He's one of the trickiest passers I've seen play the game. Shades of white chocolate. Add this clip to his highlight reel.      Previous highlights included trucking Ben Simmons in the backcourt, AD flopped on him. DJ tried to beef during the Olympics.      He's a shorter, more likable Patrick Beverly with better passing."

How does he compare to Ben Simmons coming out of LSU in that regard?
Media hype is everything for Ben Simmons
Just look up any ben simmons 3 point attempt and you'll get a good idea
Ben Simmons: you mean RoY can only be won in your rookie season? News to me.
Kuzma is our Ben Simmons when it comes to the three point shot for those Nicks fans who didn't know
"Preach. Ben Simmons shouldn‚Äôt be praised and deserves a hell of a lot more criticism than he currently gets. If I were a 6er fan I‚Äôd be straight pissed that Simmons isn‚Äôt hitting his very reachable next tier potential, I.e. having a mid range game."
Imagine being an amazing athlete your whole life and then you come to the nba and Ben Simmons does that to you
"And Ben Simmons would be the best basketball player ever if he averaged 60/20/15 on 75/60/100 shooting.  But he doesn't and won't. This is the exact same statement as ""If AI were 6 inches taller""."
The Ben Simmons clarification
"No question. Ben is a great wing defender but he provides less value than Bam who's a much better rim protector, is more versatile, has a higher defensive IQ *and* is even better on the wing than Simmons  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm9jXof-BKQ&amp;ab\_channel=UltimateSportsHighlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm9jXof-BKQ&amp;ab_channel=UltimateSportsHighlights)"
Ben Simmons is gonna be dropping 30 while you team has been outta the playoffs for a month
Lol at Ben Simmons DPOY... that‚Äôs such a joke.
That's like a fullcourt heave for Ben simmons
Ben Simmons is gonna get exposed in the playoffs again and I can't wait
"Ben Simmons being Ben Simmons.   He got his numbers and the box score will look ok, but the offense when it mattered was just So bogged down IMO."
"Absolute JOKE officiating to swing that one to the Pacers in the 4th. Sixers-Heat ESPN Thursday, they clearly wanted ratings for that one.   Danny Green did NOT touch that block. Sabonis plows over Simmons and pulls him down? Offensive foul on Ben. Harris/Maxey want to drive to the lane and get clobbered? Nothing.   What an absolutely disgraceful officiating effort tonight, but no ones going to care because it was buried in a meaningless game."
"Ben ""Whirling Dervish"" Simmons"
He‚Äôd probably be more like Ben Simmons
*laughs in Ben Simmons*
or Ben Simmons.....
Mid Range legend Ben Simmons
"Ben ""I scored 42 and I'm not a scorer"" Simmons"
Why so many Ben simmons highlights today? That‚Äôs like 3 in 5 mins. good on him
Ben Simmons fadeaway!
Khris Middleton  CJ McCollum  Karl Anthony-Towns  Kyrie Irving (people will remember him just not how great he was)  Donovan Mitchell  Nikola Vucevic  Jimmy Butler  Kyle Lowry  Ben Simmons  John Wall   Kemba Walker (might remember him for what he did in college)  Trae Young
Ben Simmons +2900 to get a triple double tonight let‚Äôs ride.
"**First Team:** Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert.   **Second Team:** Marcus Smart, Jrue Holiday, Kawhi Leonard, Mikal Brudges, Joel Embiid.  Honestly, I really considered going the ""cheating route"" of using Bam and Embiid as ""forwards"" to include Bam and Myles Turner. Shout-outs to Clint Capela, Matisse Thybulle and Paul George too."
Paul George Kawhi Leonard John Wall Dwight Howard Al Horford Kyrie Irving / Uncle Drew  Zach Lavine Donovan Mitchell Ben Simmons  Kemba Walker
Ok you're right. Ben Simmons sucks and he's a net negative player who is a complete liability on offense.
"Ben Simmons is just a 6'10 Tony Allen that hasn't gotten better since his rookie year  He's also spoiled, arrogant and selfish. Look at the way he talks about former players and refuses to adjust his game and become better (shooting, scoring) because he's a pussy. You don't believe that he can be spoiled, arrogant and selfish? Look at his upbringing. He was born rich"
"1 all nba 3rd team doesn‚Äôt make you great my guy lol.   Guys like Kemba Walker, Oladipo , al Jefferson , deandre Jordan, Dragiƒá etc have all made all nba 3rd team and all star games. I don‚Äôt consider them great or elite. They‚Äôre good players but that‚Äôs about it, same with Ben Simmons.   Again this comes down to how you define great lol."
"Sounds like Ben Simmons' origin story. ""Imma make a fool out of all those guards trying to score on me"""
PG13 in danger of this.   Bradley Beal  Jamal Murray   Karl Anthony Towns  Ben Simmons.   Aldridge.    Donavan Mitchell  Draymond who?   Oladipo   Kemba Walker
Ben Simmons is too distinct of a player not to be remembered imo
If the sixers don‚Äôt win I am going to go Ben Simmons  Lot of this probably depends on who wins a title and who doesn‚Äôt
Any shot outside of 3ft for Ben Simmons
"You are probably joking, but still... https://www.nba.com/news/defensive-player-ladder-rudy-gobert-or-ben-simmons-race-enters-final-week   Hes not even top 10"
"Looks like you didnt saw the 4 games when Ben Simmons wasnt playing when we went against Warriors, Suns and Bucks b2b."
I feel like most people include LeBron in a list of top passers. I think Luka should be in that group as well. Maybe ben Simmons if we‚Äôre just talking passing and not necessarily play making
"If Ben Simmons could shoot, he‚Äôd still be worse than Jaylen Brown. But that‚Äôs nothing to be ashamed of"
That's it Ben Simmons is gonna go into Steph Curry mode. The league has been warned.
SMH - definitely Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons
this really isn't a controversial take at all tho... the people who think Ben Simmons isn't good simply just don't watch him play and the people who say he doesn't need a jumper are diehard Sixers fans that know damn well deep down that Ben needs to be able to shoot more jumpers
"In theory I feel like it should be Ben Simmons. He already averages like 8 rpg and 8 apg. But he also has the benefit of being almost 7 feet tall, meaning rebounding later in his career may not be as big of an issue as it could be for smaller guys."
"""Knicks will beat the 76ers in the second round if they get past Atlanta. I think their defensive schemes can neutralize Simmons and Tobias to an extent, and Embiid alone will not be able to score enough.""  This would be quite something considering the Sixers have literally won 15 straight games against the Knicks and Ben Simmons has never lost a single game to them"
"Do you think that maybe Tobias looked significantly worse not only due to bad roster construction but also Philly missing Ben Simmons?   Playmaking is one of the more invisible skills, even if Ben ain‚Äôt dropping 200 assists a game just getting the ball moving properly is hella important."

"Ben Simmons needs to play right handed, just still makes 0 sense to me why he doesn't. Others include, Embiid's post moves feature him shifting his pivot feet repeatedly and should be called a travel. Jimmer could have been more than a wash out if he went somewhere other than the Kings. Kobe should have won the MVP the year he averaged 35 and Harden should have won mvp over Russ in that triple double season."
"I‚Äôm a Canadian on the East Coast and found the documentary about Joel Embiid‚Äôs path to basketball and it really spoke to me! Started watching the Sixers, and then learned more about Ben Simmons as well, which led me to researching Hinkies process. TTP baby!! I‚Äôm obsessed"
"If you think Ben Simmons has zero offensive game, then you don't know anything about basketball.  &gt; And you clearly don't since you somehow think it's appropriate to hold Butler's first seasons against him  Might wanna learn how to read"
He busted his ass to carry that deadweight of an offensive player that is Ben Simmons.   No guarantee they win against the Bucks either.  It's hard to win against good teams when your 6'10 point guard has less value on a half court offense than a high schooler.
Minor nba players beefing with really good players is always funny to me. It reminds me of Ben Simmons and Jared Dudley or Lebron and Deshawn Stevenson.
Europeans become Utah fans cause of their playstyle.  Australians become Sixers fans cause Ben Simmons.  The in between become Nuggets fans cause Jokic
"According to the Sixers website:  Embiid 7ft (280lb / 127kg) Simmons 6‚Äô11 (240lb / 109kg) Harris 6‚Äô8 (226lb / 103kg) Green 6‚Äô6 (215lb / 98kg) Korkmaz 6‚Äô7 (202lb / 92kg)  That is an enormous group of people.   I know reported heights and weights are often wrong, particularly for the biggest and smallest players, but it‚Äôs been pretty well confirmed that Simmons is 6‚Äô10 / 6‚Äô11. If you‚Äôve ever seen Ben stand next to Joel he is at least 2/3 inches taller so he seems more like 7‚Äô2 +   Last years Sixers were even bigger, but had a terrible fit. Would also be interested to see the wingspan of the top teams but can‚Äôt be bothered to do the research right now."
It's almost like Ben Simmons was guarding Jordan Clarkson out there today.
You thought you were slick slipping Ben Simmons in there lmao
"Almost as if having a 1 or 2 kryptonites doesn't take away from him being the best defender in the league. Also, I'm sure that Ben Simmons just totally cancels out Steph Curry and CP3."
"Curry, Doncic, Dame, CP3, Ben Simmons, Booker. Done."
"Curry, Doncic, Dame, CP3, Ben Simmons, Booker. Done"
"You know what's madness? There's a non-zero chance Luka ends up breaking it.  Since Russ didn't start racking them up until later in his career he ""only"" got a triple double every 5.18 games.  Luka gets one every 5.57 games.  The closest active guys I could find are Jokic and Ben Simmons who get one around every 8 games.  Historically Oscar got one every 5.74 games and Magic every 6.56, no one I could find is over Jokic/Simmons."
"Damn crazy how the Sixers gonna get the one seed when they have someone as terrible as Ben Simmons on their team, am I right u/FultzShoulder ??"
"&gt;	6‚Äô11 with Ben Simmons, Giannis, Kevin Garnett and Tim Duncan would do well, but needs a SG  Towns at the 2 maybe"
Today Fultz Shoulder set the record for most pathetic loser who is mad Ben Simmons is on a hall of fame track and Markelle Fultz is a g leaguer. Also this thread is full of the most moronic posters. Obviously Simmons needs to hit his foul shots but he‚Äôs been playing great otherwise and he‚Äôs not gonna shoot 0%.
They literally could still have missed a biblical amount 3‚Äôs like 20 and won but 27 3‚Äôs is just a curse from God. Ben Simmons would literally make more 3‚Äôs if he shot it 27 times.
The neck injury is clearly affecting him. 0/5 from FT is unexplainable unless you‚Äôre Ben Simmons
This is what listening to Ben Simmons‚Äô fake American accent every day does to a mf
Punches a guy in the nuts: https://youtu.be/OOrto2is8QA  Slaps Ben Simmons in the face: https://youtu.be/sRx8qdnrAeI  Intentionally knees George Hill in the balls: https://youtu.be/AmgqAI5fJ2Q  Grabs Khris Middleton and tries to pull him down twice in this series...  Anyone defending Dragic is insane
If the 76ers get hot and Ben Simmons lights it up from 3 maybe the 76ers can take a game or 2 but hawks in 6 at worst
Also hopefully he stops doing his best Ben Simmons impression at the line
"Put your hindsight aside. *Context matters.*  ATL was 11th in the East before the ASG.   Also, if you want Trae in, pick one of these guards to substitute at the time of the All Star Game.  - Ben Simmons - Jaylen Brown - James Harden - Zach Lavine - Kyrie Irving - Bradley Beal  Personally, I'd have swapped Jaylen for Trae. But that would've been incredibly unpopular before March 8th LOL."
Luka 0/5 FT wtf. He‚Äôs trying to outdo Ben Simmons it seems
Pretty sure they‚Äôre making a Ben Simmons joke.
But ben simmons has been missing free throws lately /s
üëÄ Ben Simmons
I wouldn‚Äôt have minded 4 more to see him tie the Ben Simmons record.
"Bah gawd, those are Ben Simmons numbers"
"You‚Äôre an idiot if you don‚Äôt see talent in Ben Simmons. Sorry he wasn‚Äôt a good bubble boy like your squad (Bam&gt;Embiid tho, right?)"
Ben Simmons technically fits your description
Come on Luka 4 more misses and you can join the 0-9 club starring Ben Simmons
"Luka is already an average defender, probably a slight positive. Ben Simmons only real weakness is his lack of shooting.  I'd still prob take Luka cuz Luka would be offensively better even if Ben could shoot as well."
Ben Simmons shooting from three you mean
Ben Simmons. A jumper is literally the only think he lacks. Luka has more holes.
Ben Simmons averages around 15-16 points while not being able to shoot at all outside of 10 ft. If he even has a leauge average level jumper he's basically unguardable. When Lebron was young his jumper was super suspect and below league average. He still averaged close to 30. When a players that bug and that athletic they're impossible to guard if they have even a mediocre jumpshot.   That's actually part of what makes Simmons so frustrating. If he's even just a bad shooter he probally averages 20-25 a game because every once and a while he'd get hot. So people would have to respect him and go out to guard him. His jumpshot is non existent though so he is what he is (which tbf is still an all star and all defense caliber player).
Ben Simmons is getting ready for a Hack-a-Ben when it counts.
"Simmons lack of a jumper is not his only problem. He's not as aggressive offensively as you'd hope he would. It'd probably  be slightly different if he had a jumper, but we don't fully know.  Luka has had much less talent around him, plays in the west and has had to be the top option on his team since he's been a rookie and despite all of that he's doing better than Ben. Add good defense and I don't see Simmons closing the gap. The latter would need Curry levels of shooting to catch up."
Ben Simmons with an Elite jumper is basically unguardable and would be an all time great. Luka is in a similar situation with Elite defense. I'd give the nod to Ben just off him being taller and bigger though.
"Why you so mad lmao, that one Ben simmons comment I made really set you off huh"
Ben Simmons with an elite jumper is better Ben Simmons with a league average jumper is not better
"Luka with good defense, give Ben Simmons a jumper and luka is still better lol"
I doubt Ben Simmons guards Trae.
Your flair is draymond green I think you should rethink your comment before trashing Ben Simmons. Green‚Äôs a Walmart version of him.
Somehow the guy who stinks is still a better shooter than Ben simmons lmao
Ben Simmons has one good season where Sixers don‚Äôt want to trade him and this is how they acting.
I remember Cowherd saying the league doesn't need LeBron and Ben Simmons is ready to carry the torch for good
Ben Simmons can have an all-time improvement in shooting and still be a shit shooter
"Lol the core is the same, the team isn‚Äôt drastically different. 3 guys who can shoot + embiid and Simmons. Tobias and embiid were there in 2019.  Ben Simmons hasn‚Äôt developed at all offensively. Hence why the same issues will happen. You can set a remind me notification if you want lol."
Breaking news: Ben Simmons bad at shooting free throws. More at 6
It‚Äôs gonna be Ben Simmons remind me in 10 years ü•±
Ben Simmons
How long before the Lakers give Jae the Ben Simmons defense?
"&gt;Simmons, much like most NBA players, would embarrass all of us  This isn't really true though. Have you played basketball at any competitive level and seen how skilled some average ballers are out there?  Plenty of normal people know how to shoot the basketball but don't have the athletic talent or bodies to ever get near the NBA level.  Ben Simmons is an amazing talent but you're deluding yourself if you think plenty of normal people can't learn to shoot better than him."
"If we locked Ben Simmons in a gym and he had to make 400 free throws to get out, would he survive?"
Lol the nets should not be scared of ben simmons killing them on offense
"KD, Harden, and Claxton are all lightyears better as defensive options on Simmons. Hell, even Landry Shamet was better on Simmons than Green was this year. Maybe you've attributed some defensive attributes to Green because he still has crazy hops, but he is legitimately a bad defender. His absence hurts Brooklyn on O, but the only effect it has on D is reducing depth. There's not a single person in the Nets organization or fanbase that has Jeff Green pencilled in as ""defensive stopper/paint deterrent"" against *anyone*, let alone Ben Simmons."
Jeff Green defending Ben Simmons on the perimeter is the Nets best shot at defending him with 1 player  What single player is preventing the Simmons‚Äô drive?
well now that this series is over Atlanta goes from one great defense to prolly the best defensive team in the east..  Ice Trae vs. Ben Simmons will be a very interesting matchup.. both offensively and defensively
You snuck Ben Simmons and Donovan Mitchell on and left Luka and Lillard off lol
"Hawks fans, how has Trae fared when being guarded by Ben Simmons?"
"Subpar-Bad defenses don‚Äôt slow down Ben Simmons *that* much is the thing, in R1 of the playoffs he has excellent success offensively"
"Having a Ben Simmons, a thybulle, a Danny green and embiid will slow them down even if it‚Äôs just a bit but our offense can keep up with theirs, sure they‚Äôre more top heavy but yesterday all the sixers starters scored 14+, if the sixers can play at that level all series I got some real hope"
he probably could dude. it's not that hard for an unathletic redditor to get good at stand still shooting.  plenty of normal people could be better at shooting than ben simmons. Shooting isn't what makes ben special.
You don't have to put much effort into slowing down Ben Simmons. Tobias Harris is the Sixers' second best scorer. The Nets are just gonna torch them. Joel Embiid post-ups aren't gonna beat the Nets lmao.
Aside from the fts Simmons has been really good on both ends of the floor. He hasn‚Äôt even had to play the 4th quarter the past 2 games because his team is winning so much. People on this sub have the same exact Ben Simmons takes as boomers calling into WIP
Simmons is why I think the winner of the Brooklyn/Milwaukee series will be the team that faces the Lakers in the Finals. Great teams can greatly hinder/limit Ben.
Ben Simmons with Steph Curry shooting is easily the GOAT.
"Nope, with good rotations it won‚Äôt end up in a strong side dunk. Miami showed how to do it late in the season and it‚Äôs already happened to the sixers in the Celtics and Toronto series. Being successful against the wizards doesn‚Äôt change that lol  Ben Simmons and the sixers are literally the only team in the NBA that has a PG that doesn‚Äôt shoot. He‚Äôs going to be relegated to the 4 and a role player like was against Toronto again. He hasn‚Äôt improved his offensive game significantly like embiid."
"Doubling Embiid either leaves Simmons open for an easy strongside dunk or DG/Curry/Harris open for 3 so you can‚Äôt do that.  Sagging off of him opens up wide open passing lanes and either dribble hand offs to green/curry with Ben screening for an open 3.  He‚Äôs in a FT slump for sure  , but analytically fouling him is 1.2 point per possession for the sixers."
if ben simmons had steph currys shot he'd be.... the best player in the nba...
Lol you sixer fans are in for a rude awakening once you play a half decent team lol. Ben Simmons is the most exploitable starter in the playoffs other than KP
I hope the Sixers win the NBA Finals without Ben Simmons making a single free throw specifically to make this guy mad
"Well shit, have the Sixers considered hiring shooting coaches that didn't give birth to Ben Simmons? Dude has had actual coaches for 6 years between LSU and the NBA, why doesn't *anyone* stop him from using his shit ass broken form?  I've broken all sorts of bad habits my parents taught me when I was a kid and no one paid me a goddamn cent to do so, let alone millions of dollars."
But we all know this isn‚Äôt accurate despite the memes and low effort attempts to take shots at flairs in what‚Äôs supposed to be honest discussion.   Ben Simmons is so elite at every other aspect of the game that the first seed in the East about to sweep their first round opponent has built an offense around him that complements his game and also needs him.   And that‚Äôs backed up in our record without him.
"Wow Ben Simmons is good, I think he should win rookie of the year this year"
"On a team with Ben Simmons, Jokic's playmaking would be fairly redundant.  Also now that Embiid had learned how to pass out of his double and triple teams a lot better, he's actually created a lot of offense for other teammates just by drawing in so much attention from the other team's defense. He doesn't get a lot of those assists on the stat sheet because we usually make the extra swing pass for the most open 3, but it's been critical to our offensive game this year beyond his scoring. Anyone who actually watches the Sixers knows this and gets tired about hearing about Jokic's playmaking."
"I love Jimmy buckets but he played out of his mind in the bubble. He wasn't going to repeat that. He couldn't get a 76ers team in 2019 with Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, JJ Reddick and himself past the Raptors. That team was absolutely stacked and Jimmy was a force but he's not a guy who can lead championship teams."

Trae and ben simmons are better.
5 ben simmons would be madness no shooting just constant running
Theres a pretty big difference between Ben Simmons and Evan Fournier or Kemba tho
"Ben ""Mona Lisa lookin' ass"" Simmons crying for DPOY"
"I‚Äôm sorry but if you think Ben Simmons is better than him I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. He‚Äôs clearly better than Devin Booker too imo. His defense is significantly more impactful than bookers offense and he‚Äôs a better offensive player than booker is a defender. Those guys you list at the bottom are mostly ridiculous. Sabonis or Morant, really?  And as for the playoffs I believe that narrative is wildly overblown. Not to mention pretty much everyone in the nba that‚Äôs been around for a while has had at least a couple bad series. Kyrie shit the bed the only time he was the best player on his team, KAT hasn‚Äôt had a good series, klay has shot 30% from the field in like 4 series and it never mattered, etc"
All you need to do to win is surround Ben Simmons with 3pt shooters.
"&gt;I guess coaches arent allowed to make adjustments lol hes bringing neto and ish smith as the only perimeter players off the bench.  So how would you defend the Embiid Simmons Harris trio  &gt;And im saying against good teams simmons ends up hurting his team offensively, curry will never do that cuz hes a shooter  If hes filling his role how is he hurting his team?  If teams are Scheming his easy low post buckets away that means tobi is on a smaller SF or gaurd and getting his, or Embiid is one on one.  Ben taking away a long defender to neutralize him doesn't work against this sixers team because it creates advantageous matchups for the other players."
"&gt; Im just pointing out that brooks hasnt tried all that much this series, regardless of if itll work or not.  This isn't how coaching works.  You don't throw shit at the wall and see where it sticks.  &gt;That comparison is also wack cuz simmons has shown hes pretty limited offensively for a dude whos 6 ft 10 and athletic as hell  I don't understand what you mean by this?  These are both players that add value to their offense by performing the role assigned to them by the coaches.  Would you rather Ben attempt to jack up a bunch of bricks and make his offense less efficient over all?"
Did they already announce him as the winner?  Ben Simmons should get dpoy
"i think giannis on simmons limits ben a lot as a player whose offensive halfcourt game is reliant on being bigger and stronger that whoever guards him  giannis can float him without worries about his jumper to help in the paint against giannis  bucks have excelent personel to slow embiid, L√≥pez + help defense from giannis  they can force him to pick his poison and either go out of the paint to guard lopez shooting and give giannis space or drop and give open shots  of course philadelphia is also excelently build to stop milwaukee offense, but bucks have more shooting and offensive creators than them so i think they can keep their offense afloat better"
Ja should get that Ben Simmons ROTY
"That leaves Simmons and Harris 1 on 1 with advantageous matchups, and then they eat like they did in games 1 and 2.  The wiz do not have the length or athleticism to deal with the 6ers big 3 on defense it really is that simple.  Brooks has tried a lot of things but Ben/Jo/Tobi are just so much bigger then anyone who is guarding them and the low post with those 3 duds is a guaranteed bucket rn."
yeah Ben Simmons is going to guard Middleton. Ben Simmons is a better defender than Duncan
"You hack him early to make him hesitant about driving, and that shit has definitely worked before.   I'm actually pretty sure Scott Brooks of all people managed to get back to within 3 from a game where Wiz were down by 20 by doing nothing but hacking Ben Simmons and sending him to the like 30 times or some shit in the 4th."
Literally what Ben Simmons would be with the same teammates
Ben Simmons is 0/9 from FT and was intentionally fouled not once. That shit is a crime against coaching.
"We're talking about NBAs shit post material Ben Simmons, not the golden child Luka Doncic"
"Well in today‚Äôs NBA Magic would be played with a smaller point, so it‚Äôs a bit of a strange comparison. Ben Simmons to me is a playmaking 4 like Draymond"
So Magic wasn't a point guard? Ben Simmons?
Ben Simmons is seriously shooting 0% at the free throw line?  How?
Ben Simmons please practice your fts lol
"Ben ‚ÄòFuck the Haters‚Äô Simmons: ball out young man, ball out"
By that logic Ben Simmons could easily be a shooter.
Is this secretly another Jrue vs Ben Simmons post
That‚Äôs straight from the Ben Simmons book of offense
"No, I‚Äôm right. Embiid and Simmons are just a bad fit together and anyone who knows anything about basketball realizes that. You‚Äôll see when Morey deals Ben this summer after you guys get bounced in the ECF. You guys are just wasting Embiid‚Äôs prime years at this point. You‚Äôll see soon enough though."
"Srsly tho, I don't get how WAS doesn't get this. FOUL Ben Simmons hard when he drives = He gets passive because dude is literally 0/10 on FT's, and you at least cut down on one of the 5 things you gotta worry about on PHI's offense."
Saying Ben Simmons is a taller more athletic Draymond shouldn‚Äôt be an insult but a role he embraces  Get some actual guards to play with him. I wonder how CJ looks on this team
[Ben Simmons is undefeated against the Knicks.](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/ben-simmons-record-vs-knicks)
Does Ben Simmons practice FTs?
Rockets should‚Äôve gone for Ben Simmons if they actually had a chance
"Eh, those stats are pretty unreliable.  Simmons was really bad on Giannis before this season.  Tobias actually was better on Giannis than Ben before this season.  Giannis has had only a couple games in his career with Simmons as his primary defender, but has had big games each time.  Ben did look much improved in matchup this season, did much better - but still Giannis did close out 76ers in game defended by Simmons, although Simmons played some great defense that fourth quarter.  76ers generally try to invite Giannis to score and have Embiid defend him, very different approach than the Heat.  It could be pretty effective, Bucks may want to continue to use Giannis more off ball to prevent offensive stagnation - or at least do a ton of DHO when Embiid sags off Giannis."
with simmons it‚Äôs more the length than the strength. the reason ben at the 5 doesn‚Äôt really work is bc he doesn‚Äôt have the length to defend at the basket. he can hold his own in the post with giannis but if giannis gets any advantage on him toward the basket it‚Äôs a layup
Ben Simmons gets clowned on regardless of performance OR game outcome.
"Jokic shoots nearly 40% from 3 lol, way you're talking you'd swear he was Ben Simmons."
"Bucks fans deserve this one 100%. Too high of expectations last year with Giannis winning a back to back MVP and his point guard being Eric Bledsoe. Now that everyone seems to count them out and having Jrue, they're dangerous. They'd pose a good fight against the Nets, more then Ben ""help I can't shoot"" Simmons, Joel ""damn I'm always hurt"" Embiid and the 76ers."
"What i dont get is why is no one questioning Doc? Ben simmons scoring went down under him along with his shot attempts and whenever asks about bens offensive all he talks about is his defense.  Doc dose not want ben to score and well, the entire 4th it looked like Doc wanted ben to do nothing."
"I feel alive seeing all of this Ben Simmons slander. All the 76ers telling me that him not having any offense game or how he can't shoot isn't a big deal because ""He can be a DPOY"" can fucking eat crow"
"Ben ‚ÄúI have to be more aggressive‚Äù Simmons after a game 4 loss, takes 4 shots wtfff is that"
Mostly Ben Simmons but yeah
Mr 4-14 FT ben Simmons? Lmao cmon now
"Well I'm certainly not familiar with everything, but off the top of my head, Falcons lost to Belichick and Brady, and Jawja lost to Saban and his semi-pro Bama team.    You're going against Doc Rivers and Ben Simmons, lol."
76ers fans downvoted the shit out of me when I said Ben Simmons was a glorified role player. Now they want him gone when all they can get for him are role players.
Lol i said i won't trade Ben Simmons for CJ b4 and I take that back. Ben is playing like Andre Roberson 0.5 rn lol. At least Andre can make 3s in the playoffs sometimes. 30%?? come on bruh
"Watching the Sixers blowing a lead in game 4 and 5 reminds of the Clips in the bubble. We had 3 double digit leads against the Nuggets in 3 games (Games 5-7 and the lead was around 15), and the Clips always blew the lead, it become common in that series  People said the Clips are mentally weak and whatnot (which is partly true) but Doc deserves some of the blame. People think we used Doc as a scapegoat but the proof is right there. Ty Lue just beat the Jazz in game 5 to take a 3-2 without KAWHI, PG and the others played great. Meanwhile Doc blows another lead to a team they're favored against.  Sure Ben Simmons plays a part, but you have to adjust. Ben isn't magically going to become better this series, you either take him out or make adjustments, which Doc rarely does at times. Philly fans should pray that Doc makes some kind of adjustment or its over."
"I'm dead serious, I would bench Ben Simmons."
Ben Simmons for Ricky Rubio
"Ernie with the assassination   ""Turned into ben simmons there"""
ooof 'he turned into Ben Simmons'.
"""Turned in to Ben Simmons"" LMFAO"
Ben Simmons about as useful as chuck swinging a golf club. Just don‚Äôt make sense.
"It's so bad. The Sixers could have sold high any of the previous years but they held out hope that Simmons would get better, at anything at all. Now, they're pretty much bound to sell this offseason and will 100% get the worst return they possibly could off of him. Last season he'd fit in star trade rumors; this season he might be worth a few more picks than Aaron Gordon.  For most players their welcome to the NBA moment is getting destroyed by a superstar on another team. For Ben it'll be being unceremoniously shipped to a bad team for mediocre assets because he's only gotten worse in a league that was already moving away from his skillset."
There's an alternate universe where Ben Simmons becomes the greatest Footie legend of all time
2 words: Ben Simmons
"Chuck said something interesting...the Clipper had nothing to lose...so now Game 6 is going to see if they can close it out...that will be the game PG will need to play great job...  Also, Ben Simmons...bro...if he does not improve his game offensively the 76ers need to do something with him because he's going to hurt them"
Ben Simmons in shambles
The funny part about this common retort is that most people who praise Ben Simmons are box score casuals
"Embiid scored 39 points and Seth Curry had 36 and they were the only two Sixers to score a field goal in the second half.  - The Hawks outscored them 40-19 in the fourth on 16 of 22 shooting.  - The Sixers still had a 97.5% chance of winning Game 5 with 4:23 remaining.  - Had 10 of 15 turnovers in the second half.  ''We got too comfortable,'' guard Ben Simmons said. ''We didn't play the way we should be playing.''"
Ben Simmons is the best defender in the League no doubt. Dude can defend 1-5
I'm an Aussie and Ben Simmons has to f-off outta here!
The thing about it is he doesn't even need a jumper (ben simmons) he just needs to hit freethrows at a respectable rate so he can play on the ball more aggressively. That would be a world of difference.
"If Westbrook isn‚Äôt according to Bill Simmons, then Ben Simmons sure as shit shouldn‚Äôt be"
Agreed. Only thing I can‚Äôt figure out is why he chooses Mann over Kennard? There‚Äôs no height difference and they both matchup well on defense. Kennard actually can shoot and when Mann‚Äôs on the floor they legit give him the Ben Simmons special and just stand at the free throw line to guard him.
Ben Simmons is just a tall Lonzo Ball.
The Assassination of the 76ers by the Coward Ben Simmons
This might shock you but MVP is not awarded to the best shooters every year. If it did curry would win it every time. Shooting better that Giannis is not achievement for anyone other than Ben Simmons right now
Ben Simmons will never in his career average 25+ a game. I'd bet my immortal soul on it.
"Lmao anyone who'd take Ben Simmons over Jamal Murray must be a crackhead. Murry is a baller, Ben is a stinker."
you don't trade Ben Simmons for CJ. You trade Ben and others for Dame
"Bruh, what the fuck  Ben Simmons has two functioning ankles, for one"
"Ben ""The fuck was that?"" Simmons"
"I‚Äôm sorry kitty, it‚Äôs not fair you had to watch Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris tonight."
"Idk what a Simmons-for-CJ trade looks like, but if it gets us something like CJ/Simons/1st, could be interesting. I‚Äôm not sure I want to trade Ben still, but I‚Äôm ready to embrace options."
"I remember a nephew made a thread about Paul George and Ben Simmons swap would be winning for both. What a disrespect to PG13, my man was balling"
Don‚Äôt let this distract you from the fact that Bojan had more 3s in 10 minutes than Ben Simmons does in his whole career
Pandemic P has shifted to Blowoff B for Ben Simmons
"It‚Äôs tough. I might say they were about equal. Klays shooting, defense, and spacing were critical. Really just a crazy good team overall. Either way Ben Simmons ain‚Äôt sniffing that level in his career! ü§£ü§£ü§£"
"The thing about lumping Ben in with all those guys is that all those guys were actually the best players on good teams. Ben Simmons could not lead a team to the playoffs, no way."
Mans been possessed by Ben Simmons
They‚Äôre basically the same player . Giannis is Greek Ben Simmons.
Remember when Ben Simmons made the all star team and Trae Young didn‚Äôt? That was really dumb
"There was a thread before the season started asking to rank these players in order: Jaylen Brown, Jamal Murray, Ben Simmons. I was shocked that my ranking in that order was controversial."
Ben Simmons should have won it. Time and time again Gobert gets exposed in the playoffs. U had Jackson and Mahn both going at him without any fear.
Ben ‚ÄúGiannis Australianwhocantshoot‚Äù Simmons
I‚Äôd take Richard Simmons over Ben.
Ben Simmons anywhere would make them worse. He's a dollar store Magic Johnson.
"The hope is Norm signs a contract and plays CJ‚Äôs role at a more efficient rate, meaning it‚Äôs a Dame - Norm - Ben - Roco - Nurk roster, Roco shot pretty well from 3 in the last half of the season and in the playoffs so the hope is the added defense of Ben (along with the fact that Norm will play better defending the 2 than the 3) would mean the offensive loss wouldn‚Äôt be as impactful as the defensive gain.   Can‚Äôt really contest anyone that wouldn‚Äôt want the trade, all I know is CJ got legitimately and consistently outplayed by Austin Rivers and Facu Campazzo all series in every aspect and I cannot imagine that team with Ben Simmons instead of CJ does worse in that series. CJ and Dame said their focus last offseason was on improving on defense and the defense was not good, so I just don‚Äôt see how the 2 players stay in Portland another season knowing their is no shot at all to make a playoff run."
Ben Simmons is not a ‚Äúsuperstar‚Äù
"This forum loves Aussies. Jingles, Ben Simmons...wait."
"I‚Äôm not saying Trae is better than luka, but trae is doing equally insane things playing against a better defense, and this season, better individual defenders. There‚Äôs three all-nba defensive players on the 76ers and Ben Simmons or thybulle is always on trae, and if he gets past them he runs into embiid.   Trae is playing some ridiculous competition as well, and as putting up an absolutely insane series."
release or trade Ben Simmons
"Fuck it, I'm still not impressed. His foul baiting is obnoxious and harmful to basketball and even though he is an elite playmaker he really likes as a scorer.  I don't care how pathetic we are and yeah Ben Simmons is worse and he can't make a fucking free throw and all the shit you want to throw at my team. I'm still not impressed by Trae."
I offer you Ben Simmons
"Seriously, like curry and Embiid got 73 between the two of them, and no other player on the team got 10, Tobi, who is often a certified bucket, had like 4, Ben Simmons is just Ben Simmons, The random spark Shake milton had 5 I think, Korkmaz was the next highest scorer, with 8"
"After tonight we shift all our slander to Playoff B, as in Ben Simmons"
"Guys like Bill Simmons still clowning the Rockets for not taking Ben Simmons instead of the Nets picks. It's absurd. Ben might need a change of scenery, but if he gets that change of scenery and doesn't improve, his contract is basically untradeable."
Ben Simmons is so gone. This summer the fans won't be nice to him
Ahh. I totally forgot when Ben Simmons was the third best player on the team with the best record in nba history. Silly me
I've been disappointed with Ben Simmons for 2 years where the fuck that OP has been all this time
And they also shit on Ben Simmons for not shooting and being limited offensively without any semblance of self-awareness  although tonight I'll admit its very much deserved
How much money is Ben Simmons getting paid to post up 8 points?!
"Trae could wear a blindfold and score 40 points with his left hand and ESPN analysts would STILL say Ben Simmons ""is the better player with a brighter future"" lmao."
"No thanks. CJ can't make plays to save himself, isn't the best dribbler and is a horrendous defender. Simmons is an elite passer and one of the best defenders in the league. This thread all full of overreactions but I'm taking Ben every day over CJ"
Ben Simmons is 3 posts away from getting the Ball Patriarch treatment.
Markieff Morris &gt; Ben Simmons
Warriors are the favorite if they have Ben.   Curry and Klay playing off one the the best passers in the leauge?   Not to mention Ben could literally play in the paint at much as he wants. He is their perfect 5 or 4. He could make significantly more offense in the paint because he wouldn't have to share it with a better dominate center like Embid.  Its not rocket science its basic logic and everyone here is just a reactionary moron. You are actually stupid if you take Draymond over Simmons.
Reg Season: Ben Simmons  Playoffs: Dray
So would you rather have prime Danny Green or Rookie Ben Simmons?
Reminder that Reggie Jackson is making 8% of what Ben Simmons is making this year.
"tobias has balled out, this was just a bad game. ben simmons has been shit for the series"
"There was a little snippet in round one of Doc shouting instructions or something at Ben who had turned his back on him and was completely ignoring him. I thought that was a danger sign and it's looking like the case with every game that passes. He simply does not listen to criticism. Unfortunately it's a bit endemic in Australian sport. Guys like Kyrgios and Tomic are great examples. They have no drive to be great and are simply in it for the money. No surprise Ben and Nick are Twitter buddies. This is the Ben Simmons the basketball world is getting and he will never improve, his offense literally peaked in his rookie season. This is coming from someone who has defended him since he came into the league. I am officially off the bandwagon..."
yea well they werent playing him like they did in the first half... also joel got no real rest towards the end of the game.. the game plan from the 6 minute mark was literally double joel anytime he got within 3 feet of the paint and ignore ben simmons. Joel played more fucking minutes on 1 leg than a younger ben simmons who did nothing on offense all game and was made trey youngs bitch on defense
ben simmons for collin sexton
"Top team or title contender doesn‚Äôt equal title favorite. There were the nets and lakers that were title favorites. And Clippers too since they upgraded their roster. Sixers were in the 2nd tier along with the bucks, heat, jazz etc. no one expected the sixers to be the favorite to win the title like they did the clippers.  Sixers are contenders every year cause they got Joel embiid. But Ben Simmons non development is holding them back from being an actual title favorites. And they‚Äôre showing that right now by sucking ass."
"Must as I like to clown on Ben Simmons, this is not a really good criticism or stat haha"
imagine having to carry every game and then be forced to come back in after 2 minutes of rest and play 40 minutes and more minutes then our 24 year old pg while getting double and triple teamed on one leg and anyone actually thinking your logic is correct... Not hard to stop a center when tobi refuses to shoot and ben is a black hole for joel to get doubled before he even has the ball... tell me how would you have game planned joel from the 6 minute mark in the 4th when he had 2 guys on him even before he had the ball anywhere near the paint while ben simmons was spectating from the dunkers position?
Ben I can hold my opponent to 10 points but only score 2 myself Simmons
Simmons was never billed as a draymond type and that‚Äôs the problem. They said he was the next lebron so people are still thinking in that vein.   His problem is he disappears. For better or for worse draymond is always involved. Sometimes you forget Ben is on the court
Ben Simmons would find a way to brick the casket off the side of the grave.
Who would you rather have Reggie Jackson or Ben Simmons?
Ben Simmons LOLZ
Trade ben simmons and 2 1sts for reggie
Send Ben Simmons to Lithuania üá±üáπ
Fair point lmao.   Revised question: Is Gobert more useful to a contending team's playoff offense than Ben Simmons?
I'm gonna say it  Pascal Siakam is better than Ben Simmons
"Agreed, his defense was legit crippling on the blazers this season but I can‚Äôt really say anyone other than R Cov and Nurk played defense on the team anyway, Norm was ok but we forced him to play the 3 and he‚Äôs a bit too small for that.  Philly cannot play another season with Ben and Joel I feel, so unless they can get a better player than CJ you gotta expect him + Ant Simons or some other young Blazer for Simmons is what they should be shooting for."
"Seriously. If you had told Kobe Bryant he could be 5% better, but he‚Äôd have to work twice as hard as he already was, he would have asked you if he could start right that second. If you told the same thing to Ben Simmons, he‚Äôd say ‚ÄúG‚Äôday mate‚Äù and walk away."
Rofl Ben Simmons was considered a superstar?
Ben Simmons laughs at your statistics.
"I would rather have Murray, BI, Jaylen Brown, Sabonis, or Siakam right now than Ben Simmons, just looking at that draft class."
If Ben Simmons died and Kyle Lowry as a middle schooler took his place I think they get an extra 5 points per game
&gt;rookie Ben Simmons.  You can just say Ben Simmons. He hasnt improved at all.
Ben Simmons don't fit with the Celtics FO's obsession of undersized guards.
"Trae should get more praise on this sub. Instead of posts about Ben Simmons or Giannis, we need to give love to this Hawks team. Everyone counted them out since the beginning of the year. Making the playin game was scene as their ceiling this year, and now they are 1 game away from the ECF. Looking like a special year for the Hawks once they take care of the 76ers in 6."
BeN sImMoNs DoEsNt NeEd To ShOoT tHe BaLl. He DoEs So0o0o0 mUcH fOr YoU dEfEnSiVlY!
I just don't understand it. I've never practiced basketball and took some time last three months practicing free throws. Looked up some tips and read stuff but went out 3-4 times a week to shoot for half an hour or hour. I probably went from 30% to 60%. I knows this ain't the same. But come on. If chubby 28 years old man can get his numbers up significantly than Ben Simmons has absouletely no excuse why he's shooting so fucking bad.   But yeah. It's just so weird. Great thing about basketball is that you can easily practice by yourself. I just don't believe that he's putting in enough work. If you need more time to get better free throws than fucking do it
"Yes, there is a reason why Doc defended Ben in the press to the point of anger/rage when his aggressiveness/attempts per game was questioned -  Simmons scoring usage was by design and something specifically instructed by the coaching staff."
The guy literally shits on Giannis for things that he praises Ben Simmons for.
Ben Simmons is better than him at his peak
"‚ÄúAlright dame, so the best we can do for you is ben simmons‚Äù  Dame: ‚úåüèæ"
&gt; I feel like the Spurs would help them with cap space for Ben Simmons.  You think the Sixers are trading Ben Simmons for a signed and traded DeRozan? Simmons has got much more trade value than that. I've seen Spurs fans say they'd be happy with Kuzma and Montrezl Harrell for DeRozan.
lmao salt detected. Not our fault Ben Simmons is scared to dunk ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The same reason ben Simmons gets no love. He can‚Äôt shoot‚Ä¶
"Booker, Blake, D‚Äôangelo Russell, Jordan Clarkson, Ben Simmons, Kuzma, Chandler Parsons (so far)"
It's actually nicknamed hack a shaq because Ben Simmons lived in a shack in Australia growing up
Not what he‚Äôs saying. He‚Äôs saying they basically neutralize Ben Simmons on offense he became super passive out of fear of being fouled
"Do you really feel like what Giannis has done in these playoffs doesn't change how we should feel about him at all? You said this in your OP:  &gt; why is 1 championship that much of differentiator when Giannis already accomplished so much?  Do you really feel like winning in the postseason is irrelevant, and that instead it's all just about what kind of stats someone puts up in the regular season? I absolutely do not understand the logic in that. Like for instance, Ben Simmons has had a lot of people re-evaluate him based on how he's played in the playoffs, especially this year. By your logic none of that should matter because all we should be looking at is what he's accomplished in the regular season.   Legacies are made or broken by how well someone succeeds in the playoffs, and rightly so, I think. The playoffs is a pressure cooker, a crucible where we see if players can elevate their game under repeated stress tests. In the regular season teams don't have time to individually prepare for their opponents every night, so maybe a good player with glaring flaws can still dominate all season. But in the playoffs when an opponent has time to prepare a strategy specifically tailored to one opponent, those flaws can be magnified and exploited.   Shouldn't a player who's able to adjust and beat you different ways be elevated above someone who's only capable of spamming one method of play? I think so. In the playoffs you must be able to beat a multitude of teams and play styles. If you're incapable of doing that, then yes, I think that should affect how we evaluate you.   There's obviously always context to all of these discussions, like the circumstances of Russell's championships versus those of modern day players, and it's never as simple as the number of rings being the only way to compare people. But I absolutely think it was right for people to be skeptical of Giannis because he'd been repeatedly stopped by his poor FT shooting and teams just ""building a wall"" against him, just like it's right if people factor in this playoff run as proof he's figured out how to win in spite of those methods used against him."
Here's a list of all stars that were drafted by small market teams in the past 20 years (MVPs in bold):  * Zion * Donovan Mitchell * Bam * Sabonis * KAT * LaVine * **Jokic** * Oladipo * **Giannis** * Gobert * AD * Lillard * Drummond * Middleton * Kyrie * Kemba * Vucevic * Kawhi * Isaiah Thomas * Cousins * Hawyward * PG * **Harden** * Tyreke Evans * **WB** * Love * Hibbert * Lopez * Dragic * **Durant** * Conley * Roy * Rondo * Lowry * Millsap * Bogut * Deron * CP3 * Granger * Dwight * Emeka Okafor * Deng * Jameer Nelson * **Lebron** * Melo * Wade * David West * Mo Williams * Kyle Korver * Amare * Caron Butler * Boozer  Here are those drafted by big markets (top 10: https://mediatracks.com/resources/nielsen-dma-rankings-2020/)  * Trae * Tatum * Ben Simmons * Ingram * Jaylen Brown * Porzingis * D'Angelo Russell * Embiid * Randle * Siakam (I think Toronto is a pretty damn big market) * Beal * Dray * Klay * Butler * Wall * Griffin * **Steph** * DeRozan * Jrue Holiday * Jeff Teague * Rose * DeAndre Jordan * Horford * Noah * Gasol * Aldridge * Bynum * Lee * Devin Harris * Iguodala * Al Jefferson * Bosh * Kaman * Josh Howard * Yao Ming  **A lot more all stars and a lot more superstars were drafted by small market teams.**
"&gt; Obviously, when Joel (Embiid) got hurt, that was the game that we ended up winning. And we felt like we should have won the next game, but they just wanted it a little bit more than we did. And Joel didn‚Äôt even play that game. But at the same time we kind of exposed the move of fouling Ben (Simmons), putting him on the line a few times. Granted, I think in our series he actually made a few. So, we had to go away from that instead of just giving away free points. But they were two totally different series, two totally different teams. Ben was more or less aggressive in our series, the first couple games, and then it kind of died down and trickled down from there. Atlanta was a good team, too. They played hard. They have a lot of young pieces over there who are really versatile. They‚Äôre not just a one-dimensional team. It was very tough. Joel had to do a lot."
"Ben Simmons in shambles. That right there is why you practice jumpers, even if Giannis isn‚Äôt good at them he at least has the capability to take that shot and make it"
"You know that‚Äôs not to be taken literally right? Just because these guys want to win doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre always pushing themselves to actually make it happen,  Or maybe I‚Äôm just hyper sensitive watching Ben ‚Äúwant it less‚Äù Simmons all year."
*cries in Ben simmons*
Still better than Ben Simmons lol
Seeing Ben Simmons this postseason would've made me turncoat if I were a Sixers fan
"depending on how they expect saric to bounce back, I think they may need Ben Simmons if he can at least try to put things together. Depends on him making better choices and having a wake up call according to the news on this sub.  This would help their defense and also give them some ball handling as cp3 insurance as long as he becomes playable. It‚Äôs hard to upgrade ball handling outside of CP3 and Cam Payne but they have to. He could be the next Charles Barkley in terms of someone who meeds to rehabilitate his image but can potentially push them further  tough spot with cp3 but I don‚Äôt see them getting anywhere if he gets paid the max for any amount of years. Barkley after the finals run gave up some of his money to help the team. CP3 has already made so much and also makes money off the court. I don‚Äôt know what to expect there but I hope he at least meets the suns somewhere in the middle if he wants to win."
Would love to see Lowry and Derozan reunite in Philly. I feel like the Spurs would help them with cap space for Ben Simmons.
"And let's not pretend like the games should have ever gotten to that point. I dont know how anyone who watched those games could say ""man if only Tisse hadn't fouled the shooter we should have won.""  Ffs We blew a 26 point lead and then a 20 point lead the next loss.  Ben Simmons left 48 points on the floor from missed free throws. 48 Points! You wanna blame a single player? Start there.    Blaming Tisse for dumb fouls after we already made monumental collapses is asinine. Ben passing up a wide open game tying dunk, Tobi only scoring 5 points, Seth making Huerter look like the 2nd coming of Kob were all way bigger contributors to us losing than Tisse's foul."
ben simmons was always right after all
"Because it's so much harder to guard on the perimeter. As good as you are, players are always gonna get by you. And when they get by you, there's always gonna be somebody behind you. The rim is the most important place to defend so the players defending the rim are always gonna impact defense more. I'd argue players like Jrue, Ben Simmons, etc. are the best defenders in the league because it's the hardest but difficulty != most impactful. There's honestly no way around saying that Gobert is the most impactful because of that  I'd liken it a little to NFL defense. Cornerback is the hardest position because you're out there on an island and like impossible to not get beat every so often. But (and there's an argument to be made) I think having a great pass rush is more important than great secondary. Because it's easier to affect the pass by getting to the QB and making it uncomfortable for him and makes a bigger impact"
Wait I actually like that lineup. There‚Äôs a nice amount of spacing around Simmons and he‚Äôs the third option where he can thrive. I also think you can get a shooters and Ben Simmons lineup with their bench and that would be a good lineup for your second unit
My answer is obviously perennial DPOY contender and allstar Ben Simmons lol
"&gt;Giannis is very confident always stays aggressive I hardly doubt he thinks he‚Äôs going to miss his free throws cause if he did you‚Äôd think he‚Äôd be way more hesitant to draw fouls.  He‚Äôs also not Ben Simmons lol. This has more to do with FT% than confidence. Giannis could be the most confident guy on earth; deep down he still knows he‚Äôs a bad shooter.  &gt;He can make the statement without sounding like an asshole.  It‚Äôs more of a difference of opinion than sounding like an asshole, because it‚Äôs a completely valid observation."
He's probably a bit short but if you thinks he is better than jrue Ben simmons Siakam Lowry Gobert he makes the cut Him and jrue were ranked 26 and 27 by SI on season start
Yeah but he's got stiff competition from Shanghai Sharks PG Ben Simmons who will probably win CBA MVP next year
Same dude was really tryna lump Giannis in with Ben Simmons lmao
imagine comparing giannis to ben simmons
the anti Ben Simmons
"Same man, same. Also, I forgot the obvious choice, Ben Simmons. Despite his offensive woes, defensively that dude is a menace. With his length, defensive iq and lateral quickness, he's a nightmare for any offensive player."
Bucks are pretty much the only real championship contenders in the East after the Nets. 76ers turned out to be frauds and now they may have find a new line up thanks to useless Ben Simmons. Hawks although did amazing this season is still a young team that may need a few more years to develop. And that's pretty much it. Knicks did better than expected but don't see them as contenders. The Heat had a flame going but not anymore.
Doc Rivers taught Ben Simmons how to shoot?
"Ben Simmons didn‚Äôt get worse, the competition just got better.   He was doing that same dumb shit all season long.  It was just exposed when playing the top teams, became more of a liability."
Makes wonder what Ben Simmons would‚Äôve done in that situation
"Hell, the average D1 college player is a better FT shooter than Ben Simmons  Simmons' shooting is like outlier-level bad"
Alot of Embiid's issue's this year were almost entirely because of Ben Simmons shortcomings. Not even trying to pile on Ben either. Embiid strikes me as guy who would do anything to win. If his team was constructed in away that he could play like Giannis (in terms of at time picking his spots and playing off secondary action) he would.
"‚ÄúIf we make all of his flaws strengths then he‚Äôs the GOAT‚Äù - this sub about Giannis and formerly Ben Simmons  I don‚Äôt think Giannis will ever have a respectable jumpshot at this point, but the free throws are definitely possible, since he‚Äôs done it in the past."
He's making a Ben Simmons joke mate
"Love Dray to death, he can't stop Embiid lol. Barely anyone can, if he has a rhythm. The only person who can stop Embiid is Ben Simmons, lmao."
"It's hard these days with all these position less players. Starts w Bron but the list is getting bigger every year. KD is on the same boat as Giannis, calling him a PF is selling him short. What about Ben Simmons or Draymond, they are hard to just put in one category.  What about Steph, the greatest shooter ever is not a shooting guard.  BI n Siakam are a couple others off the top of my head. Curious how far this will evolve in the future."
wdym? Kat is best friends with Booker and Ben Simmons.
"Giannis is prepared to look like a damn fool on national television, then he'll go out and do it again.  Ben Simmons, on the other hand, is plain scared."
"The level of delusion from Sixers fans about Ben Simmons is fucking insane.  Just an insane fan base.  They‚Äôre bad but Phoenix is just aggressively dickish and mean-spirited, so I wouldn‚Äôt say they‚Äôre worse."
Ben Simmons
Cant beat Ben Simmons
Does Simmons give him a boost? Or does he stand on Ben Simmons in that scenario?
No. But on Ben Simmons he can.
They can foul Giannis without the ball outside of the final 2 min of the quarter.  The Hawks did this to Ben Simmons.
Filthy.   Ben Simmons. That's how to not play like a chump. I hope you had a blank tape in the vcr to record that game along with pen n paper for to take notes.
not rlly... giannis attempted more threes in his first season than ben simmons has in his career.
Giannis has always had a better more reliable jump shot than Ben Simmons...at no point in their careers did anybody ever think Ben Simmons was a better shooter than Giannis...
Cuz Giannis doesn't give a fuck if he bricks Ben Simmons is afraid to shoot
I can probably dunk on Ben Simmons honestly real talk
there hasn‚Äôt been a time where giannis wasn‚Äôt a better shooter than ben simmons
Not sure why the suns are not hacking him like the hawks did against Ben simmons
"Ben Simmons.  EDIT: Looked at your flair, this must be high level sarcasm. Good job, you almost got me"
he doesn't lock himself into a miss mentally like ben simmons but he clearly is always anticipating it and he's smart to do so. the whole team looks like they practice reacting to his missed free throws

Ben Simmons has left the chat.
Nah I don't think Giannis has the Ben Simmons mentality
"I mean what's the list? Giannis sure, gobert sure, then it starts getting slightly murky but still I'd say Ben Simmons, and embiid. 5th I think I'd be fine with tho unless I'm really forgetting someone. Kawhii,kd,LeBron all can be better but don't have consistent defense effort anymore or ever. Cp3 would probably be an honorable mention, kinda Kyle Lowry but he is lower down at like 8/9 to me.  Ohhh ad is above Simmons below embiid or whatever order but better as well.  sorry jrue is 6th."
"Khris ""Batman"" Middleton. Greek Cheeks can't touch the ball in crunch time because he turns into Ben Simmons at the free throw line in the clutch."
"I'm kinda shocked people are choosing to die on the ""Booker = Kobe"" hill. Normally comparing young players to all time greats gets (rightfully) mocked.   Like comparing Ayton to Shaq, or comparing Ben Simmons to Magic Johnson gets laughed at and not taken seriously. But for whatever reason people like to do the Booker=Kobe thing."
"Top 5?  Thybulle, Jrue, Embiid, AD, Gobert, Ben Simmons  Of those guys, I‚Äôm taking AD and Embiid over him"
Ben Simmons take notes
the anti ben simmons
Ben Simmons is one pair of Greek nuts away from being the next Giannis
"""Hold my beer"" - Ben Simmons"
whose the ben simmons now
Your best player not being able to hit FTs is the biggest fucking liability.   And Ben Simmons is even worse but people think it‚Äôs possible to build a contender with him
Hit up Ben Simmons for that camp kekw
"Yea them leftovers from Blake Griffin, Jordan Clarkson, and Ben Simmons lmao"
Giannis really shooting Ben simmons-esque but he still loves getting those fouls
Cos he is not Ben Simmons. Giannis actually improved his FT in like a week. That's a hungry man right there
Pope for Ben Simmons who says no
"Chris ‚ÄúBen Simmons‚Äù Paul, choking, not scoring, refusing to try an score at times and getting pass happy"
And while being on the phone. He tried to pull a trade for Ben Simmons.
I hear Tyler Herro is available. Might even be able to get Tyrese Maxey in a 3 team trade. With one used Ben Simmons added in.
When Ben Simmons hits a 3‚Ä¶.?
"Maybe we should put Ben Simmons in the movie Old, because he still won't shoot the damn ball 5 minutes later, no matter how old he gets."
"76ers fans defended Ben Simmons the whole year until he got played off the floor in the Playoffs because he can't hit free throws and is scared to shoot. Jrue is struggling on offense, but he substantially better on offense than Simmons. Simmons literally has made 0 offensive improvements since being in the league."
Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen someone in their head this much about shooting free throws. And that includes Ben Simmons.
Teague pulling a Ben simmons
"Wow this sub is crazy dumb sometimes. OG and Ben aren't even in the same class of assets, and the guy's argument is ""OG can shoot 40% from 3"".  So that means Duncan Robinson is worth more than Giannis, huh?  Simmons is an all-star, all-NBA defender and maybe the most versatile defender in the league, a chess piece that can match up against anyone, and these mfs say ""LOL NO 3S OG BETTAH"""
"And Ben Simmons, first basketball player ever to never attempt to score."
they need to find a good coach first before worrying about dame and ben simmons
"When did i say that? I said the Hawks had only 1 real superstar, Trae Young, and yall lost. With a full healthy team. The dymbass 76ers org babied Ben Simmons. He has so much raw talent but since your owners is dumb as shit they let him goof off during the off-season and he never got any better. Just the fact that yall hired Doc shows how incompetent that organization is. Keep jerking off to shoes my friend ‚úå."
"You think Ben Simmons is a superstar ü§£ü§£ü§£Utah elevation depriving your brain of any oxygen, isn‚Äôt it?"
Aren't you a 6ers fan? That's pretty sad tbh. Yall wasted Ben Simmons and will never get him a ring.
"The Sixers will never trade Simmons for CJ and having said that, I understand Portland don‚Äôt want to trade Dame either. It‚Äôs just that the Blazers have less leverage if Dame requests a trade and wants out. Then it becomes a matter of securing the best return for him and trying to make a viable playoff contending team.  Supposedly Dame wants a trade to the Sixers or the Knicks, but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs true.  I don‚Äôt see how Wiseman helps make the Blazers a play off contender near term. At least with Simmons and the right players around him you can knock out enough regular seasons wins to make the play offs where Ben will shit the bed again."
"Jayson Tatum turns 20, Ben Simmons wins ROY on the Blazers"
Ben Simmons league leader in 3 pointers
"I don‚Äôt know about other teams, but I know the Sixers are happy to trade Ben Simmons."
Nah bro I‚Äôm just saying Ben Simmons is like one of the best point guards in 2k cause you can just abuse his size.
And ben Simmons is a multi time all star in the actual nba too.
If dame is demanding a trade they‚Äôre not getting anyone close to ADs level. The best player floated so far is Ben fuckin Simmons lol
"Yeah he‚Äôs done, trade him for Ben Simmons"
"Except Morey/Rivers caused the problem by not just kissing Ben's ass.  A really great coach or GM has more tools than just analytics and beating players over the head with the money stick.  The NBA is full of player's with big egos, if you treat every player like a slab of meat instead of a person things aren't going to work out well.  Fact is that Ben has some issues in his game that need working out but calling him the only reason that the 76ers lost vs ATL last  year in the playoffs is unfair.  If Tobias Harris had made more of his shots or Embiid didn't have 8 turnovers the game result would have been different as well.  Then that jackass Doc Rivers made the problem worse and Philadelphia fans piled on.  NBA is a team sport, Simmons carries his weight.  He isn't a perfect player but there are plenty of other guys in the NBA that produce less for their teams than he does vs. their salary.  I put 75% of the blame for the situation on the coach, GM, and Philadelphia fans (who are generally acknowledged as being among the worst in the US in every sport).  I'd want a change of scenery myself if I were Simmons."
1 coby white and picks for ben simmons please
"Same. I don't want to diminish mental health issues but ""Ben Simmons bullshit his way into therapy"" still seems like a very strong possibility."
Nobody can tell me they watched Ben Simmons for 4 years and expect him to be a different player than he's proven to be.
Embiid is the franchise. He is the reason they are doing all this Ben Simmons circus. If Embiid goes to Morey and says ‚Äújust get Ben out of here‚Äù then I‚Äôd bet my life savings that Morey takes the best offer that same day
"I know Ben had a rough year on and off the court, if I were him I‚Äôd want out as well, and I think it‚Äôs entirely possible whatever his issues, they‚Äôre completely genuine. If this was the card he was going to play, it should‚Äôve happened from the jump minus all the drama. My issue is, of course the players association are cornered in supporting him because he‚Äôs exercising his right for a leave of absence in light of a mental health crisis. Michelle Roberts would be very bad at her job if she didn‚Äôt side with Simmons on this issue. The issue is the stigma attached because he‚Äôd already demanded a trade, already not reported to camp, and has already been suspended for conduct detrimental to the team. I‚Äôve become pretty familiar with the CBA of the NBA. Article XXII section 11 deals with fitness to play. Simmons ultimately on course to go in front of arbitrator for withholding services, Simmons was unlikely to have a good outcome. What he‚Äôs done by claiming he‚Äôs had a mental health issue, is bought himself time. I think eventually what‚Äôs going to have to happen is Article XXII will be triggered and a panel of mental health experts appointed by the NBA and players association will rule on Simmons to fitness to play. I wouldn‚Äôt want that to happen if I were Simmons, those panels really exist to determine if a NBA player has a life threatening condition. I worry he‚Äôs going to find himself in a one flew over cuckoos nest type of situation. What happens if they find he can‚Äôt play basketball? I just doubt Rich Paul ever thinks the stuff he does through. If Simmons is determined not fit to play, he won‚Äôt be allowed to play until he‚Äôs cleared by the same panel."
"It's not about winning a trade, it's about winning a position.  If your core is Embiid &amp; McCollum, you're not winning a 'ship. Do not try and bust my balls over a hypothetical, we all know it's true.  If your core is Embiid, you're not winning a 'ship.  If your core is Embiid and a Ben Simmons with a mentality change (e.g. he is willing to shoot jumpers, work hard, play daring basketball, be aggressive, etc) you might win a 'ship.  If you trade Simmons for another difference maker, you might win a 'ship.  Do the math. Morey's reasoning here is actually completely rational, and that's why he said what he said. Perhaps I'm the only one, but I think Morey's not bluffing when he says this can go on for 4 years. Morey's a guy that sticks to the numbers and the math is easy to read. Decision is quite simple. If your goal is to win, the beatings continue until morale improves (or Morey lucks his way into a Dame-asks-out scenario)."
The discussion is about draft night and drafting the best player at the time on that draft night. Simmons was better than Brown in 2016 draft night.  How are you not getting this? Where in the blue hell did I ever say Ben Simmons is better than Jaylen Brown as of currently??
Eh - without Embiid the Sixers are going nowhere anyway. So not a lot of incentive to dump Ben soon.   Ben‚Äôs best leverage is a healthy Embiid and a struggling Sixers team. That‚Äôs the scenario where Morey can‚Äôt justify sitting on Simmons without risking the season slipping away.
"Imagine saying no to CJ McCollum for Ben Simmons.  Like I get Morey wants to win every trade but is Simmons for CJ not a slight win for the 76ers?  And to the people saying CJ and Seth can‚Äôt play together, you realize a team can make more than 1 trade a season?  The 76ers have Seth Curry, Isiah Joe, Maxey, and a 1st that they could move to improve the roster and they still have nice depth even if they traded all 3 players for 1 player."
"If the blazers and 6ers do a dame/simmons swap, both will end up in the Finals  I love the idea of a CJ/Norm/Covington/Simmons/Nance lineup.  Very switchable, athletic, good shooting around Ben."
"when everyone is panicking and you sell low...you lose. I think Morey is doing the right thing. SOMEONE will want Ben Simmons - just not now. Patience is key in these trades especially for someone like Simmons who can completely change a teams chances of winning.  Maybe one month from now maybe 2..but the smart thing is to HODL BEN. Unless youre an idiot and trade him for peanuts just so the Sixers can feel better in the locker room. Who cares how the sixers feel in the locker room, they arent winning a championship even if theyre happy."
"Imagine being an owner having Embiid as your franchise player and spending time seeing who has the bigger dick with Ben Simmons. Get this man help ASAP. Like wtf, the East is open......."
So if theres not a package to make them contenders...whats the point to trade him now. They wont be contenders and they arent getting another Ben Simmons. They have one ben worth something and theyre gonna get something back for it. Im on Morey's side.  sixers tanked for years to get number 1 pick Simmons and theyre gonna just let him go?  If they made a trade with solid role players and Embiid STILL cant contend..whats is the point?...they got no more assets to make them better and pretty much theyre screwed for the next couple years.
Ben Simmons alone is a better return than what the Rockets got from the Nets
And how about getting out of the East with Embiid and Ben Simmons' dead cap space?
Morey was dangling Ben Simmons to every team this offseason and is surprised that Simmons doesn‚Äôt wanna play for the Sixers anymore.
"If we're looking at things objectively.  AD was coming from a long championship run and didn't have time to recover from his injury, let alone from the season before. Now it looking like Embiid needs another star (or playmaker. Ben Simmons) to play to his potential (like AD)."
Can we sticky this to the top of every Ben simmons thread?
Their bench got exposed because the Knicks are much much deeper than them. A bench that could be helped by trading Ben Simmons for a few role players and picks. That would be a difference maker for the Sixers.
"IMO, this has always been the plan.  Russ isn't a great fit alongside LeBron but he does offer tremendous value as a guy who can run and gun with a bunch of bench players and maybe keep the Lakers record afloat when LeBron and AD are both out for various injuries/rest throughout the season.   It's a little like Ben Simmons in this way and I suspect the 6ers are going to be in big trouble if Embiid gets injured again."
"Finally, it is time for ""Ben Simmons is the good guy"" to take over the sub."
You're braindead if you think at any point Raptors offered that trade for Ben Simmons.
*Morey trades Simmons for Brogdon and a pick*  Author of this article: Morey is so afraid of ruining another team with a PG that can't shoot that he makes a horrible trade that makes 76ers a perennial 1st round exit!  *Morey doesn't trade Simmons and clearly states that he either wants Ben to return or get a difference maker in return*  Author of this article: Morey is so afraid of losing another trade that he won't trade Simmons unless he gets the farm!
Pulling a Ben Simmons.
"And Morey doesn‚Äôt have to trade Ben Simmons for less than he thinks Ben Simmons is worth.  If ownership disagrees they can fire him. There‚Äôs been plenty of trades Morey has made over the years to save money, so clearly he listens to ownership."
"I still don't understand how Morey asked Ujiri for Lowry, Vanvleet, Anunoby AND Barnes, for Simmons?! Like, 3 starters and a top 4 pick for Ben Simmons?? Insane"
"Simmons isnt an all star talent, the fact he made the team is a joke  He has always been trash but ESPN sucking him off in college gave him an infalted ego  Dont care about Doc or Morey, Ben cant be a top 4 player on a championship team"
This Article is really bad  It‚Äôs seems Simmons himself aid this man to write the article   The main premise being Ben has no future in Philly when Daryl this week said Ben has a future in Philly  Than the Author makes up out of no where alternative motives for Daryl except what Daryl has stated  Daryl wants been to play for the sixers   This is what happens when you write about a topic you don‚Äôt know   Truth is Ben signed a contract extension that means the Sixers have world wide exclusive rights to his basketball services in return Ben gets 200 mill dollars  Ben wants out odd if Ben had blown out both his knees would Ben let the sixers out of the contract he‚Äôll no
Ben Simmons play make is elite but easily replaceable?? Explain
"That‚Äôs fair- if the rumors that Tillman didn‚Äôt pull the trigger on a Ben Simmons deal because of his beef with Morey, that‚Äôs kind of a joke imo"
"I'm black myself and can't think of anyone I know, let alone me, who wouldn't be incensed by getting slapped in the head twice by my boss IN PUBLIC, regardless of his ethnicity. No doubt this incident contributed to Malik wanting out along with other reasons.  The thing you're missing is that the younger generation handles aggressive discipline a lot less easier (Malik is only 23). Just ask Ben Simmons."
Dudes the second best off season open runs highlight player after Ben Simmons.
Lol this is the approach Ben Simmons should‚Äôve had.  Imagine he was 2/24 right now from 3
It was about time someone was dumb enough to try and relate Ben Simmons with AD
"He did force his way out of a team, which is a pretty good way to get people to hate you.  See Ben simmons"
"6-8 a decade?  1 year into this decade we have: Lebron, AD, Steph, Giannis, Jokic, Booker, Kwahi, Durant, Kyrie, James, Dame  Easy 10  Edit: forgot Embiid, Luka and also Ben Simmons most likely in the future if not now"
Ben Simmons will feel right at home
Sixers should trade Embiid and keep Simmons. Embiid is always hurt and if was gone Ben would have the space he needs.
"That being said, there is a difference between not being able to shoot and downright refusing to score. It's a mentality thing that is the downfall of Ben Simmons in any era. Why would you practice shooting the whole off season just to never use it in real games?"
"ESPN had AD ranked as the #2 player before the 2020-21 season, ahead of Giannis. Embiid was #14 behind Bam. Davis has always been an overhyped Robin and Embiid was a goofy Batman that people really just started taking seriously last year.  If you consider Jrue Holiday and Ben Simmons to be roughly equivalent players, then it‚Äôs clear to see how much more Embiid has accomplished with PHI than AD did with NOLA"
"I was at the game... a lot of people were actually chanting ""fuck Ben Simmons"" lol"
imagine getting compared to ben simmons lol
"so.... you're saying Simmons can't be tall Rondo because Simmons is taller than Rondo?  and because Simmons is... quicker than Rondo was?  Is the problem here that when I say Simmons is tall Rondo you think I'm saying that Simmons is bad? You know I'm a Celtics fan, right? Rondo was an amazing player up until the knee injury and subsequent business decisions. If I wanted to be an asshole I would be all like ""Ben Simmons is nothing like Rondo because Ben Simmons hasn't won anything yaryaryar"""
A little funny about the rumors of LeVert (and pieces) for Simmons.  One wants to play and the team is holding him back.  The other is Ben Simmons.
"Ben Simmons is 25. He has been an all-defense first-teamer twice. (He hasn't been a DPOY)  When Rajon Rondo was 25, he had been an all-defense first-teamer twice and a second-teamer once.  Why are you fighting this?"
They are talking about Ben Simmons isn't it?
Because the need to virtue signal about mental illness has made Ben Simmons immune to criticism. Well played Rich Paul

"But seriously, where IS Ben Simmons?"
More like just strung together a bunch of random shit in a comment that makes no sense. Everyone is so soft (clearly discrediting any mental health issue here). Mental health is not an excuse for shortcomings? = Ben Simmons poor performance can in no way be attributed by his own mental health status. Take responsibility for your happiness = well idk how the fuck any of that ties in together. If dude requests time to work on his happiness I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs taking responsibility but that‚Äôs just my thought.
Can the Lakers get Ben Simmons for LeBron
"Everyone is asking *where* is Ben Simmons, but no one is asking *how* is Ben Simmons"
Stfu Ben Simmons Stan. Where‚Äôs Ben Simmons?!!!
Im gonna get sick of these useless laker player praise or bash posts honestly makes me dislike the lakers for no reason  I wish it was the same few ppl doing it but it seems like the nba fanbase only cares about the lakers and ben simmons
"i didnt read the entire thread, but just so u know... ben simmons dilemma is really complex. He shouldve been an pf, which is what his natural size is. but they made him pg coz he is really good at passing. Now he doesnt offer much of threat in the perimeter and tends to play under basket. I am sure that he could be like a sabonis if he tried. But again, he isnt meant to be a pg and everybody was ok with it, until the playoffs exit. Then shift entire blame on ben. Also, no need to argue too much, everyone has different opinion, and its completely fine"
Ben Simmons is a decent player. /s
"1. The Magic should move to Tampa. It's a bigger market only an hour away from Orlando. The team would probably be taken more seriously if they weren't named after Disney World.  2. Offensive Goaltending should be allowed  3. All-Star Game should go back to East vs. West  4. Calling owners ""governors"" is pandering and insulting to the intelligence of everyone involved  5. The lockout is coming and will be completely necessary to prevent more Ben Simmons, AD, etc situations"
"Ah yes, hating Ben Simmons brings everyone together."
"That's not what I'm saying.  Guess what, Embiid was 12-0 against the Knicks before this game.  Hell, Furkan Korkmaz was 10-0 against us until tonight.  The reason is that the sixers beat us 15 times in a row, and *that* happened because we sucked ass for years while they were a playoff team. Saying that ""ben simmons is 14-0 against the Knicks"" literally doesn't mean anything. Far more interesting stats are stuff like how Kemba was 0-28 against LeBron at one point. Or how Horford was 0-10 in the playoffs against LeBron for a while."
Throw in a couple of first rounders and pick swaps and you have yourselves Ben Simmons
"If the spurs traded away Dejounte Murray for Ben Simmons it‚Äôd be highway robbery for the 76ers. DJ‚Äôs obviously got a lower ceiling but his floor is way higher, DJ is a leader and a great influence on the spurs which would do more for the 76ers than ben does. Ben is a slightly better defender (although DJ was all defensive 2nd team before his injury in 2019) but DJ would offer so much more offensively. He‚Äôs just understated because he plays in San Antonio post Duncan. They‚Äôre honestly super comparable players they‚Äôre both 25 but DJ is better coached and isn‚Äôt afraid to shoot."
"My unpopular opinion is that Philly may have been better off long term trading Embiid. But they would've had to act insanely fast, and that wasn't really realistic. Simmons value is so low right now that whatever you'd get for him plus Embiid most likely isn't winning you anything especially with Brk &amp; Milwaukee at peak right now. So... maybe you could trade Embiid, Toby &amp; Curry. Get a boatload of assets. Ben is still young enough that with the assets you get... he'd never have to shoot the fucking ball and could become basically Draymond.   Realize one of them has to be traded. Embiid may not age that great. You're probably not getting anything worthwhile in a Simmons trade. So kick the can down the road a few years. Trade everyone, let Ben sit out this season for some ""injury"" and hopefully Philly fans kind of cool off on hating him in that time, get an huge amount of assets for Embiid (plus a few more for Toby and Seth) and end up with a really nice pick of your own after blowing it up. In 3 years that team could be like 10 deep with legitimate players, Ben allowed to become Draymond.   It very well could have been a better long term move. If this Embiid team never wins a championship and he gets even 1 lower body injury in the next few seasons... keeping Ben probably actually does turn out to be a way better move. Great young deep team that has a longer window in 3 or 4 seasons and maybe KD is no longer on Brk and Mil isn't as good. But that was never even really on the table for Philly. They would've immediately had to side with Ben and trade Embiid... which just wasn't happening, ever.   And remember... this is an *unpopular* opinion, I'm fully aware of how it sounds. Huge, huge gamble that could've paid off. Instead of trading the least valuable asset, trade the most valuable asset and shift the contention window while also avoiding the current Brk &amp; Mil teams which they probably aren't beating with Embiid and whatever a Simmons trade nets them anyways. It *could've* worked out very nicely. Not at all realistic though"
I like Ben Simmons‚Äô passing up a shot celebration called ‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt playing‚Äù
"Get rid of that bum, that's Ben Simmons levels of 4th Q production!"
"Has Ben Simmons' trade value gone up now that he has mental health issues, or ""mental health issues""?  It seems a bit odd that he was \_so\_ overleveraged that he had to come back to the team because he couldn't even afford going a couple of months without a salary. Cray.  ...adding, him 'practicing' with the team today or similar -- weird. I wonder what is going to happen. Every time I see someone on TV talking about the situation, *they knew perfectly well all along* exactly how it all would play out.  :-D"
I told my boys that Luka was overrated and I would rather have Ben Simmons over him. This was after Luka‚Äôs rookie season.
"This is a comment from someone who follows the Sixers and Ben Simmons. Do you people notice how he actually knows what the fuck he's talking about? How even when he criticizes Ben he actually brings up real issues that never get discussed (like his sub-par finishing at the rim) and not just the shit that gets meme'd to death?   And notice how he's looking at all sides and assigning appropriate blame, in his opinion? Not just taking a side and defending it come hell or high water?  I wish more people would make posts like these. And not just spew the same absolute moronic statements like he ""refuses to improve"" or he ""hasn't gotten better since his rookie year."" I don't even think that last one is possible for an NBA player.   No one of consequence except Tobias has handled this entire thing perfectly. And I said at the time someone should take some heat off of Ben and really have his back after Game 5 and no one wanted to listen. Everyone just wanted to blame him for the collapse and give him no credit for the lead. Blame him for losses and give no credit for wins. I actually want him to stay but why the fuck would he want to? He gets paid either way. Maybe he can go somewhere that doesn't blame his deficiencies for every problem on the team. I got shouted down on the Sixers sub for even trying to suggest that he needed someone to have his back in the press and take some of the blame. Then we saw how he played in G6 and G7. Like a man who was starting to believe he was the reason they lost, solely, and who didn't want it to happen again. Got away with it in G6 but not G7.   Then when Joel and Doc made their comments, even more people were saying that was wrong. Win as a team lose as a team, number one rule especially when talking to the media. Kenny Smith and several others said it *at the time* but now we're Shocked Pikachu that he wanted out? Why would he want to stay? Why would he even think the team wants him to stay?   Anyway, I appreciate comments like this and not just dumb shit repeated and upvotes until this sub thinks it's fact."
The NBA shouldn‚Äôt be concerned with politics. Kyrie doesn‚Äôt deserve the amount of hate he is getting for a personal medical choice. Ben Simmons shouldn‚Äôt have ever made the All-Star team.
Maybe the real Ben Simmons is the friends we made along the way
"At what point are people going to realise that Embiids ability to dominate was/is drastically affected by Simmons play? No they aren‚Äôt the ideal fit together, a dominant PG or SG like Beal or Lillard would fit better of course. But Simmons push in transition, his drive and kick to shooters and his willingness to throw it into Embiid in the post take so much of the burden off of Embiids shoulders. Not to mention Embiid is having to cover to Curry, Maxey and Harris defensively without Ben there. Everyone pointing out Simmons flaws also ignore his actual value to this team."
"Nah, Philly is just shit without Ben Simmons."
"Lol ok, so you're deciding to get personal with an internet stranger to defend a 6'10"" manchild who makes 30+ million dollars a year?  First off I enjoy my job and if i needed i could get 40k cash liquidated and in hand in 3 business days from an investment account. I wouldnt excactly say I'm poor. And thats not even the point of my original comment, friend.   Yeah, players deserve the right to want to leave their current place. But what you arent acknowledging is that they signed a contract with the orginazation saying they will perform their job and meet team requirments for the agreed upon amount of years. What upsets me and i would wager a large majority of fans would agree, is that this SPECIFIC player, Ben Simmons is refusing to uphold to that contract and he is getting paid an ungodly amount of money.   Let me put it this way. Lets say you work with someone in your department of work. They decide after performing terribly on a project you worked on that they no longer want to put in any work or even show up there and STILL want to get paid while you try to pick up the slack. Would you defend their actions?"
Honestly if they had Ben Simmons they wouldve actually had a perimeter defense.
Where's ben simmons
Ben Simmons has left the chat
"Whether or not that story is true, I agree that it‚Äôs probably better for Simmons and Philly to move on. But, then Morey has been very stingy about moving Ben, so if Ben is happier outside of the team, then it seems that doesn‚Äôt really factor at all in Morey‚Äôs decision making. Obviously the Sixers want what they see is fair, but based on news, it seems they‚Äôve been especially picky on trades here."
"Despite his flaws, if the entire league were redrafted right now, Ben Simmons would go in the first round"
"‚ÄúThe NBA would like you to know the facts about the COVID 19 Vaccine, unlike Kyrie Irving or Ben Simmons‚Äù"

"Bro, open youtube and search ""Ben simmons brick compilation"".. Theres ENTIRE videos dedicated to him bricking jump shots during games.."
"No he doesn‚Äôt. He doesn‚Äôt at all.  And yes people would like him trying to Improve his shot more than him doing absolutely nothing. Who gets joked about more, Ben Simmons or giannis, a bad shooter, but a shooter who‚Äôs trying to improve and is willing to take jumpers ?"
Dude gets paid multi million to play a game for like half the year. He doesn‚Äôt train in the off season based on his improvement rate. And now he doesn‚Äôt wanna show up for work during the half a year he is required to work.  It might be metal stability now but it wasn‚Äôt in the past. Ben Simmons is a lazy pos having a hard time coming to grips with a situation he created himself.
Ben Simmons tried to get out of playing game 7 against Atlanta with a Covid Protocol violation on himself. I think Ben is dealing with something mentally and I think a change of scenery would be good for Ben and Philly.

"Judging by how people are taking it from this thread alone is a good indicator of how Ben Simmons will take Doc‚Äôs comments, which is he‚Äôll take it personally. I‚Äôm sure Doc is tired of having to deal with situation, but it is his job and maybe he should choose his words more wisely, at least change the tone, to help end this mess more quickly.   There‚Äôs some Warrior drama going on with Wiggins and not taking the vaccine so maybe we‚Äôll take Simmons in a trade plus a few of our rooks. Don‚Äôt want this personally, but I can see this happening in the near future."
"Embiid posts up more than anybody in the league. But KAT is also up there in terms of posting up as well ‚Ä¶   KAT and Simmons may be a better duo than Embiid and Simmons   But KAT Simmons and the Twolves roster is not a better fit overall than Embiid and Sixers shooters.    Ben needs to evolve. That‚Äôs all it is. If he doesnt, his impact won‚Äôt rise exponentially without a drastically different situation."
Ben Simmons lol

Ben Simmons is a Trump supporter confirmed
"Maybe, but you're missing the bigger picture.   For the most part, people were more antagonistic towards Ben Simmons thinking he was over-reacting to dumb comments from Doc and Embiid. Now the tables have significantly turned. As you can see in this thread, mostly everyone are far more antagonistic towards Rivers after this pointless remark and more sympathetic to Simmons.   Due to Doc continuing to put his foot in his mouth, this also hurts the 76ers as an organization by extension for no good reason whatsoever."
"Smooth diversion. Getting off of Ben Simmons with the one topic guaranteed to distract everyone, Trump."
"I love it, drag that rat ass Ben Simmons name through the mud"
If Lee Harvey Oswald was like Ben Simmons JFK wouldn't have been assassinated.  Since he wouldn't have taken the shot.
trade his sage burning ass for Ben Simmons
The difference between Ben Simmons and a Trump supporter is they keep taking shots.
"The zero improvement argument is kind of blown out of proportion, Ben simply isn‚Äôt great at shooting and creating his own offense in the half court but he‚Äôs elite at nearly everything else and is a top 3 defender in the league so people acting like he‚Äôs not improving when he‚Äôs already played at an elite level is crazy. The entire season the game plan revolves around Embiid and having him dominate while Simmons did what he was good at. When the playoffs came around Doc suddenly expected Simmons to turn his whole game around to play more aggressive on offense when he hadn‚Äôt done that all season, blame Doc not Simmons."
"The 76ers acknowledged they don‚Äôt want him, couldn‚Äôt get rid of him because they were asking for way too much, and now they‚Äôre expecting him to be committed to their organization when the organization isn‚Äôt committed to him. He wouldn‚Äôt be in this situation if the team had either 1. Stood behind him or 2. Worked in good faith to execute a trade, instead of asking for a bigger trade package than what the Rockets got for Harden. The 76ers could‚Äôve completely avoided this situation one way or another, but now that they‚Äôve botched it, it‚Äôs Ben Simmons‚Äô fault? I‚Äôm not a fan of his game, but I don‚Äôt blame him one bit for the way he‚Äôs carrying about his business."
"I don't give a fuck about Ben Simmons nor should they. It's a lost cause, even if we lose all the now little value he still has, it is still worth it."
"Rewatch the series, and you'll see two names show up throughout for their 4th quarter disappearing act. Joel Embiid gets a pass, and even shockingly applauded for hanging Simmons out to dry, when in fact without Ben there all eyes would be on him."
Kind of weird to use that analogy when Ben Simmons is Australian.
"The difference was the each had a bad game.  Ben Simmons had 7 bad games back to back, and by the end was so bad that Doc had to waste time outs so that he would only have to play on defense."
"&gt;  Ben gets the most attention because nephews watch highlights and wank off to Ben Simmons hate porn.  You're missing a big piece of the difference between Ben and Doc/Joel/Harris. Whether the latter 3 made a lot of mistakes or not, they were trying their best to win. Ben draws so much criticism because he hurt his team by refusing to shoot, something that's entirely within his control.   He had one (1!) 4th quarter FG attempt over the last 6 games of the series (plus a whopping 2 in game 1). He took 14 shots total in the last 3 games of the series (even Ben Wallace averaged 6 shots per game in his playoffs career). Simmons passed out of dunking on Trae in crunch time of game 7. All of those are completely unacceptable for your #3 scored. And when you put it all together, it's a completely different situation than Doc, Embiid, and Harris. Those guys tried and made mistakes, maybe too many. But at least they went down swinging. But Simmons was seemingly afraid to even try."
Dallas are making the WCF.  Nets are not making the finals.  LeBron is going to be the oldest MVP in league history.  Ben Simmons is going to start shooting 3s after his trade.  Cavs are making the playoffs.
"The Sixers asked for Wiggins in the trade deal that fell through just before the Draft. So maybe some new variation of that trade is now in the works. When a teams says that a player won't be availably that usually means that a trade is immanent   Pre-Draft trade offer:  The **Philadelphia 76ers** offered **Ben Simmons** to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for former first overall pick **Andrew Wiggins**, 2020 second overall selection James Wiseman, and four first-rounders, including this year's No. 7 and No. 14 picks."
"NBA fans, like most fans, can be very toxic.  Pair that with the fact that it‚Äôs the off-season and people are itching to talk about basketball, regardless of what it is, and you have Ben Simmons‚Äô newfound infamy."
"Ironically its you who cant see the nuance here. Ben played bad and should be criticized but Doc also shouldnt be feeding media narratives about his own players by falling for very obvious bait. While i dont have a whole lot of sympathy for simmons, I dont blame him at all for taking exception to Doc's comments and the FO not backing him up after the fact"
"3 way trade between lonzo, ben simmons, and terry rozier to get the ball brothers all in charlotte. Ben in chicago and rozier in philly. Liangelo ball becomes the next seth curry being the ignition off the bench. Ben and zach lavine have amazing chemistry"
"WOW, he might as well have said ""Let me be clear. Fuck Ben Simmons."""
"Doc: ""This Ben Simmons is a real piece of Human Garbage. Every breath he takes is a breath that could be better used by Murderers and Rapists. If I had a gun with two bullets and was in a room with Ben Simmons, Adolf Hitler, and Osama Bin Laden I would Shoot Ben Simmons Twice. I look forward to the day I can take a shit on Ben Simmons grave. Anyone who ever loved Ben Simmons was wrong.  Ben Simmons is so ugly, that when he was born the Dr. Slapped his mother. Ben Simmons' Mama so fat the bitch gets through life sideways....  ...so, Ben for Damian Lillard seems fair, right?"""
"People in the comments acting like there was still a chance that Ben stays with the 76ers. No, Doc did not dig himself a deeper hole. No, their trade leverage has not changed. It was 0 before the comment and it‚Äôs still 0 after the comment. Maybe Simmons and his camp like Doc even less now, but that‚Äôs about all that‚Äôs going to come of this"
I wouldn‚Äôt give a flying fuck if I was Doc. Fuck Ben Simmons.
Ben Simmons is like the potato famine because he is also bad
Ben Simmons is a Bonafide Q-Anon Trump Thumper according to Doc!
-Lakers are plagued by injuries that again derails their season.  -Utah Jazz make it to the finals. (I had to include this)  -GSW again land in the playin tournament.  -Sixers implode with/without Ben Simmons
"&gt;-Miami still loses in round 1 even with Lowry  If they get past the 2nd round, I'll be very surprised.  &gt;-MPJ is an all star  This is doable, but he might fuck himself with his vaccination status.  &gt;-Ben Simmons doesn‚Äôt play a game this season  I think he'll play, but not until the new year at least.   Other than that:  the Bulls will be top 3 in the East,  Scottie Barnes will surprise everyone once he gets rolling halfway through the season, and will finish 2nd in ROTY voting after Jalen Green."
"I‚Äôm not conflating the two eras of Green‚Äôs career. Draymond was a 39% three point shooter in 2016, there‚Äôs no confusing that. He shot 28% from three last season, on 126 attempts. That‚Äôs basically two attempts per game. Simmons shot 10 threes all season, total. There‚Äôs a difference between Green taking what the defense gives him on occasion in an attempt to keep them honest, and Ben flat out refusing to take that shot.   If Simmons does flourish on the Warriors as you think, it will take some time, and he won‚Äôt be the ceiling raiser Draymond is anytime soon. The one thing people neglect to bring up is how Green unlocks elite level Steph.   Regardless, Lacob put a nail in the Simmons trade coffin when he took a $50K fine to publicly say it‚Äôs a bad on-court and financial fit."
The easiest job?   Ben Simmons shooting sleeve
"Why is it automatic that a better deal would come up? If Ben isn‚Äôt going to play, there isn‚Äôt much of a reason that his value would considerably increase.    The sixers aren‚Äôt going to get equal value for Simmons. They have no leverage and he is at his lowest possible value. But that also don‚Äôt mean that they can‚Äôt make a trade that makes them better. Guys like Beasley and Bev are not nearly as good as Simmons, but their style probably works better with embiid. So while the talent is not equal, it could still well for the better"
Same. I really want Ben Simmons to get traded and have the best season of his career and prove the haters wrong. I‚Äôm not a big Simmons fan and he obviously fucked up in Philly but the aggressiveness of the hate towards him makes me root for him.
Yes finally the fun part of this whole Ben Simmons saga
Trump and Ben Simmons are best friends. They play golf on the weekends. /s
Funny Doc used the Trump Won argument.  That may also explains why some think Ben Simmons is great player.
ben simmons‚Äô jersey demands a trade
Timberwolves will get Ben Simmons and be a top 5 team in the west ü§ûüèæ
"Philly sure ain‚Äôt LA and ben never had any problem with the location. Yeah maybe it‚Äôs less likely that he stays in Denver long term but it seems ben and his camp understand he just doesn‚Äôt have the leverage to get to the team of his choosing, I really think he‚Äôd be happy to play anywhere but philly. I think people are going off of this perception of ben simmons being a glitzy LA guy/a diva (the amount of people I‚Äôve seen call be a lockerroom cancer this offseason is insane), so they judge him off that rather than his actions/words."
Ben Simmons is too focused on overturning the election to practice
"&gt;  they could run him similar to Giannis-  They can't. Giannis is way way better basketball player than Ben Simmons. Don't get how Simmons keep getting compared to players who average 30 points, which is disrespectful to players like Giannis."
That someone? Ben Simmons.
"Ben ""Stop The Count"" Simmons."
Honestly I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more likely Ben Simmons reports to training camp more than it is for Doc Rivers to get a contract extension.
"Wiggins nickname by the Warriors is 2 way Wiggins.  Also, didnt the Warriors owner basically say he doesnt want Ben Simmons?"
Ben Simmons a trump supporter ???
"If you actually watch the clip, he wasn't asked anything remotely political, the question was ""are you going to be able to bring Ben Simmons back?"" Doc brought the Trump thing in entirely on his own."
"""Ben Simmons was just Tupac with a Scooby-doo mask on and a fake accent, and he's taking his talents back to making music"""
Yeah the joke is calling Ben Simmons/his team as dense as a Trump supporter that thinks he won the election. I get it though the media game is tough for coaches to figure out and Doc's only been doing this job for two decades
Yeah Ben Simmons has never experienced public humiliation before that /s  He's been a punching bag for years. People CONSTANTLY shit on his shooting
"Ben Simmons has long been lauded for his regular season floor raising abilities but has, rightfully so, had concerns drawn about how his skillset would adapt in the playoffs. It wasn't even remotely close to the ""worst choke job"" ever."
Did doc really just compare ben Simmons to a racist white supremacy supporter‚Ä¶.
"Anyway, if you aren't familiar with pro sports, let me translate what Doc said:  We would have been more than happy if Ben Simmons never entered Pennsylvania again. But, it turns out 29 other teams also don't think he's very valuable. So, we want to have him come back, hopefully get a good few weeks from him and then trade him to the highest bidder."
Ben Simmons is not a negative asset.  Lots of NBA GM's are on the hot seat and generally just need to show improvement one year to the next to keep their high-paying/profile jobs.  That's why you see mediocre players get overpaid every year.  Just need one team to start slow and a GM to feel pressured to make a move.  Happens every year.
I'm sure that's how Ben Simmons feels with the direction of the team and their inability to find a legitimate role for him in it. I dunno. Honestly I think the 76ers and Rivers are the ones in total denial. It's a player's league. It really is. They can attempt to push him around all they want bu this days are done there and they are the ones who need to accept it. Like what's their end game? Gonna force a guy into the locker room when he's expressly told you he doesnt' want to be there? That's going to work? Keeping someone on an NBA team who truly does not want to be there is like treating cancer by ignoring what your doctor said.
Ben Simmons is literally a pedophile and also Hitler   \- Doc Rivers
It's fun to imagine how Ben Simmons would react to hearing this.
"The irony... Look Ina mirror buddy, that's how you look.   Instead of just admitting that you were wrong about Ben Simmons not being bigger than Duncan Robinson, you resorted to cursing and childish tactics. Your inability to accept a simple fact led to embarrassment because you doubled down on ignorance. You do you I guess, if that is all you are capable of, not my life or my problem. Blocked."
"&gt;If there‚Äôs no better deal than Cj for Ben and assets  That‚Äôs not a deal anyone is discussing though! Like I said, no GM in the league, Blazers GM included, would ask to attach unprotected firsts to Ben Simmons in order to trade him for Cj.  You keep talking about that ‚Äòdeal‚Äô as if the Blazers said that‚Äôs the only way they would trade for Ben but the reality is the Blazers would be lucky to trade Cj for Ben straight up!  Idk why you think you‚Äôd have to attach an unprotected 1st to Ben to trade him for Cj but literally every GM would consider themselves lucky if they were able to trade Cj for Ben straight up"
The problem is that no one respects Ben Simmons. Not even himself.
"Ben Simmons: ""We actually won that series and I had a 100 point triple double. Recheck the boxscore"""
"""Hey, you wanna shit talk Ben Simmons some more?""  Doc: ""Hold my beer."""
"Ben Simmons shot .342 from the FT line and refused to shoot due to his fear of being hacked and put on the line. I'm sorry but not even a bigs with a reputation of being terrible FT shooters like Shaq and Dwight were THAT bad. I understand it's mental for Simmons, but you don't think it was for Shaq and Dwight. All these guys shoot better in practice, but in the end of the day a guy like Shaq was a absolute beast and if you hacked him, he'd atleast get you a point on average every trip, and he had a tendancy to catch rhythym. Simmons has gotten worse progressively instead of showing some improvements. This cant happen if you got yourself a max extension and you've been in the NBA for 5 years. He looked better offensively when he was in college than he actually does now. It's ridiculous."
Ben Simmons fan base about to be all Trump supporters
"I agree with you. The best thing to say to the media is always ""no comment"" but the league does want people talking about basketball. So as annoying as this Ben Simmons thing would seem, it actually helps the NBA. It's not a sport. It's entertainment."
Ben Simmons
Watch trump hear these comments and publicly support Ben Simmons
"&gt;no other player this year was slandered for a mediocre playoff performance by their own teammates and coach  I swear Doc and Embiid's comments just get worse and worse every time someone references them. Next you're gonna tell me Joel was threatening to murder Ben's family because of the loss.   &gt; I‚Äôll be honest. I thought the turning point was when we ‚Äì I don‚Äôt know how to say it. But I thought the turning point was just, we had an open shot and we made one free throw and we missed the other and then they came down and scored and we didn‚Äôt get a good possession on the other end and Trae came back and he made a 3 and then, from there down four. And then I got ‚Äì it‚Äôs on me. I turned the ball over, tried to make something happen from the perimeter. But I thought that was the turning point.   That's what he said. Doc was asked if Ben Simmons could be the *point guard* on a championship team, and he said:   &gt; I don't know the answer to that right now   That's it. So spare me the clickbaity ""Ben Simmons was SLANDERED by his coach and teammates"" horseshit."
KP and Ben Simmons are traded for each other. KP gives Sixers some spacing and Simmons gives Dallas some defense.
"ESPN: ""Doc Rivers claims Ben Simmons voted for Trump!!"""
"Doc's next presser:. ""it's not for me to say whether Ben Simmons is or is not being controlled by freemasons."""
"i don't coddle Ben.  I want him gone.  I also want Doc gone.   Doc for being a shitty playoff coach.  Ben for being a shitty playoff player.   They'd be fine if we didn't also have an MVP level star in his prime, but we do so we need to do everything we can to surround him with the right guy.   And this is exactly what Doc said.   We all knew what he was saying.   &gt;MURPHY: Do you think Ben Simmons can still be a point guard for a championship team like the one you guys want to become?  &gt;RIVERS: I don't know that question or the answer to that right now.

"Embiid is way better than Simmons and is not the reason Ben sucks on offense, but Embiid is also a bad fit with Simmons on offense. Both can be true."
Ben ‚ÄúImmortan Joe‚Äù Simmons
"Bro, fans put hate on random things.  People hate Lebron for making correct decions and usually the best plays. Its clear people get super emotionally connected to this game that has millions of variables which alot of them are very random. When things dont go their way they need somone to take out this distress out on, which is usually the easiest target (whether justified or unjustified).  If ben simmons started yelling like draymond would people still hate him, proably because he has very clear weakness."
"Honestly, I still don't think it was that bad. It's not like he answered ""Hell Naw"" to the question whether simmons is a pg to a championship team (Can't even be a pg for a conference final team, straight talk lol). Didn't automatically translate to Ben sucking, i thought.   This though, is a shit public statement lol. Further adding gasoline to a burning bridge."
so uhhhh.....he just compared ben simmons (and his camp) to insurrectionists LOL  noice
"Nah, don't trade him at all in that situation.    The goal is to improve the 76ers, not trade Ben Simmons."
[Charania] Ben Simmons revealed he was just about to leave for training camp when he saw Doc's tweet comparing him to conspiracy theorists.
"Espn: ‚Äòis ben simmons thinking of taking his talents to kabul?‚Äô  Fox: ‚Äòis afghanistan ready to take the next step?‚Äô  Nbc: ‚Äòmove over wine for the young socialites, let‚Äôs talk heroin!‚Äô"
"This comment is beyond stupid because ANYONE who is blaming Doc also knows BEN SIMMONS CHOKED WE ALL KNOW THAT, but some fans just insist it was only Ben, Not Harris throwing up brick after brick or Embiid giving the Hawks the ball for free."
"Ben Simmons... ""Am I a joke to you""  Calls up Rich Paul. ""Ayo P they think I'm a joke."""
lol Morey went to Philly and lost the Ben Simmons sweepstakes
"Osama Ben Simmons, destroying playoff hopes like the twin towers."
Ben Simmons doesn't owe Doc anything. He's a coward of a coach and I hope he talks his way out of a job.
"Lmao no way the 6ers would have to attach a 1st to Ben for Cj, let alone an unprotected 1st.  Ben Simmons is straight up a better player than Cj. Y‚Äôall are ridiculous"
You know what Ben Simmons deserves out after that comment. How in the hell are you trying to fix things with Simmons and then insulted him and his team during the process? You want him back but basically called his people idiots?  Doc has been bad at PR stuff but he‚Äôs acting like he wants the guy traded but can‚Äôt say it.
"This is the internet, there is a position for everything. I've seen plenty of ""this series is on Doc"" comments on social media.   Obviously you're going to get more attention on Ben because    1: Hating Ben Simmons has been popular since his rookie season   2: He literally made NBA history with his poor shooting   3: We actually watched him fail. Nobody is making lowlight compilations of Doc standing by the bench choosing his shitty rotations."
"""Ben Simmons is basically in a Berlin bunker with cyanide in his dog and a gun to his head"""
Thank god you asked! It's been at least 20 minutes since someone posted about Ben Simmons.
"Ben Simmons is a hologram, invented by the deep state"
"He just doesn‚Äôt give a fuck. But I‚Äôm pretty sure I read that Simmons hasn‚Äôt talked to Rivers directly, so this may be throwing shade at Klutch and his camp. Given that we know Rich Paul hasn‚Äôt communicated things to his clients (Noel), maybe Doc is saying to Ben, ‚Äúlook I‚Äôm trying but my messages aren‚Äôt getting through.‚Äù"
Yeah I'm officially sick of hearing about Ben Simmons. Shit or get off the pot.
"\- Jason Kidd and the Mavs are \*not\* a good match.  Drama again by year end.  Mavs win 45 or fewer  \- Lebron has a few nagging injuries and doesn't play more than 50 games.  Anthony Davis roars back with a vengeance and wins MVP with Lakers in 3rd seed and low-50s wins  \- Nuggets win 60, take #1 seed over Jazz with 59 wins  \- Ben Simmons traded to Timberwolves, 76ers essentially fleeced since they are the only team who wants him.  Wolves still don't make the playoffs  \- Rick Carlisle makes a big difference in Indiana, and they achieve the 2 seed in the East - runner up for coach of the year"
"I'm probably Ben's biggest stan on this sub and even I've never said Ben wasn't responsible for the loss. If he shot more than 50 on FT we would've won. If he finished better at the rim and was aggressive in scoring, we would've won. But my biggest issue wasn't one player underperforming, it happens and it sucks. It was the team losing multiple 20pt leads over the series and losing to a worse team ( no offence to the Hawks). That simply doesn't happen because one player shat the bed. Embiid was the sole reason for losing a winnable game and was atrocious in multiple 4qts but he gets a pass imo because he was injured, Tobi was absolute garbage on both ends. The biggest culprit was Doc who failed this team multiple times by running all bench lineups. There was a lot of people failing in that series but Ben gets the most attention because nephews watch highlights and wank off to Ben Simmons hate porn."
With Ben Simmons as a sub.
You‚Äôd trade Ben Simmons for Tyrese Maxey?
"""Like, how old are you?"" LMFAO  I would trade for Tyrese Maxey. I would have Tyrese Maxey on my team ... I would not trade for Ben Simmons. I would not have Ben Simmons on my team.  Ben absolutely makes the Sixers more beatable. If they had Tyrese Maxey playing the way he is now against the Hawks in last year's playoffs they would have won the series."
"First off, foh with that gatekeeping bs about how anyone who disagrees with you ‚Äúnever played a sport seriously‚Äù. Like, how old are you? Second, if you‚Äôre really trying to argue that Tyrese Maxey is better or more valuable than a 3x all star, all nba, 2x all defense player in Ben Simmons, go ahead, but don‚Äôt pretend to be some authoritative figure in an internet forum discussion about it.   Ben hasn‚Äôt been traded because Morey is a no nonsense GM that won‚Äôt take anything less than a Harden level haul. And if you really want to take the stance that Ben is a locker room cancer for the 6rs thats fine, I would agree, but that doesn‚Äôt make Maxey any better of a player than Ben. Obviously someone playing and buying into team chemistry is better than someone not playing at all, nobody is making that argument. The point is that the 76rs should flip Ben for an equal level player and elevate their status, and in another world, if they were to make a trade, if it were for someone like Maxey it would be an absolute fleece against the 6rs."
"How can Simmons get traded? Does anyone know if his mental illness makes him unable to play basketball *at all* -- like, for *any* team? Or does his mental illness only and specifcally prevent him from playing for the 76ers alone? Has his agent Rich Paul assured all other teams that Ben Simmons' mental illness will be cured the day he joins their team? If not, what team would take on his $100M contract if he continues to have a mental illness that prevents him from playing basketball? I would have to assume there are ZERO teams in the NBA that would not only not trade for him, but that wouldn't take him for no return due to his huge salary and an unfortunate mental illness that makes it impossible for him to play basketball, go to meetings, work out, or do *anything at all* except receive a paycheck."
Ben Simmons
At least Ben Simmons can D up. Westbrook doesn't do anything positive.
"He should fire himself. For all of his shortcomings, Vogel didn't tank LA's season by trading for the biggest albatross this side  of Ben Simmons."
"What ""young star"" are people imagining is available?  If you say Ben Simmons I will track you down and hit you in the face with a custard pie."
So explain to me why you don't think Ben Simmons could have a mental issue that prevents him from playing basketball. We all know he can physically play.
"I mean, it's not like there are many point guards in the league that are better on defense than Steph to begin with. Ben Simmons is the only ""point guard"" that was clearly better than Steph on defense, and he retired. Now, Gary Payton II is the only clear cut better defensive point guard. No reason to pick on Westbrook here."
"Ben Simmons is the only guard that makes me not wonder why they're called guards and not, idk, attackers or something"
Some Philly fan in here trying to argue with me that Ben Simmons is not a guard just so he can prove a point that Caruso is a top 5 defender as a guard in the league smdh
but ben simmons  /s
"Josh Okogie kinda looks like Ben Simmons, think its the nose"
Fr lmao. You can have a disgruntled Ben Simmons or you can have Zion and the difference is Maxey? Foh lmao.
Wait it's Bill Simmons who said that?  Shit maybe Shams got Bill &amp; Ben mixed up and it's actually Bill who's mental health is in danger lol.
"The Boston Celtics OBLITERATE the defending champion Milwaukee Bucks behind WINNING performances from team LEADERS Jayson Tatum and Marcus Smart.

guys like oubre steph and ben simmons can play for the team too. but only off the bench ofcourse.
Does Ben Simmons count as an NBA player if he doesnt play in the NBA?

Ben Simmons is bizzaro world George Costanza
"Oregon State, shooters are really lacking. While the departure of Ethan Thompson has allowed for more ball dominant players I just don‚Äôt think we have the core to really allow Simmons to shine. I know NIL is a big step forward, but I don‚Äôt think profits from that alone would be enough to satisfy Ben, whose accustomed to a healthy NBA salary, especially considering Corvallis is a small market."
Anyone remember when they were comparing Lavine to Ben Simmons and the overall consensus was that Simmons is overall better?  Aged like fine milk
The Knicks FEAR Ben Simmons
Noah‚Äôs main asset was passion. Thibs would get on Simmons‚Äô ass and Ben would pout and hey would hate each other.
This made me get on the ‚Äúfuck Ben Simmons‚Äù bus. Stop exploiting mental health you fucking pussy
It's an interesting scenario in retrospect. Would the Sixers have beat the Hawks with Lonzo instead of Simmons? I imagine Lonzo would have been more consistent than Ben and possibly opened the floor more for Embiid and Harris.   I could see arguments either way.
"I‚Äôm a sixers fan. I genuinely wish that disorganised franchise NOP trades us BI for Simmons lol. Zion &amp; Ben clogging up the paint would be a beauty to see. BI aka baby Kd who is certainly going to be a perennial all star / all nba calibre player throughout his career would be a dream acquisition. But yeah stylistically, Zion &amp; Ben would be as bad as it gets. Ruining a genuine talent in Zion by pairing him with weak &amp; feeble loser in Ben Simmons."
"Unless they trade Zion for Ben. lmao   But you know, Tyrese Maxey and Ben Simmons for Zion would improve the Pelicans imo. Tyrese/Devonte'/Ingram/Simmons/Valanciunas is better than their current lineup imo.  Zion/Embiid is a questionable fit though"
"Wasn't sure if you meant the Capital Bullets (which they were called after Baltimore and before Washington for one year, 1974 I think) or the hockey team which debuted in '74/75.  Either way, time travel is probably Ben Simmons' best option at this point."
A player criticizing a teammate after a heartbreaking playoff loss shouldnt be the end of a relationship lol. Ben Simmons cant be that soft. Also shopping guys and not trading them happens. You have to play through it. The sixers are under no obligation to trade him.
Something something Ben Simmons

"&gt; The hypocrisy of you saying you struggle with depression but yet he should be able to get better within a few months.   I did not say ""should be able to"". You've missed the point.  The point is that IF Ben Simmons has not gotten better, then something else has to give.   &gt; Do you define abusing his mental illness by saying he doesn‚Äôt want to play? Why isn‚Äôt that a valid thing. My work gives me sick time, which mental illness falls under, so why can‚Äôt he have some?  Holy shit man, he's missed training camp, preseason, hasn't played a game, doesn't talk to his teammates, and doesn't participate in practices... maybe abuse isn't the right word, but whatever word you might use to describe ""doing less than the bare minimum but still getting paid"", I'd call it that."
"Yep.  I‚Äôll be the first to admit that Simmons has handled the entire situation horribly, but that doesn‚Äôt mean he is lying about this.  Just ask: are Ben Simmons‚Äô actions those of a person that is mentally healthy?  No?  Well, there you go.  And I realize that people will say ‚Äúyeah but he only said he had mental health issues after the back injury claim fell apart.‚Äù  Again, that sounds like something that a person with mental illness might do."
Why? What makes us the worst situation for Ben Simmons?
"No, it actually shows what you know about mental illness. Yes that stuff can help, but it probably isn't going to cure depression. Like the other guy said, because of this being Simmons' third excuse now, we can reasonably assume he's gonna magically feel better as soon as he gets on another team and that's suspect as fuck.   You remind me of the people who upon hearing I was depressed say ""what do you have to be sad about? What you need is a nice vacation."" News flash. Depression isn't just being sad. Mental illness is an actual illness. And people like Ben Simmons are abusing the progress guys like Love and Derozan have made on mental health awareness by treating it as an easy way to collect his checks."
Pulled a Ben Simmons.
Sixers fans (and Morey) not understanding sunk cost fallacy seems to be a recurring theme.  At this point I think it's clear that Ben isn't gonna play for you guys. Right now he's contributing zero to your team. Literally any player is better than a player you're paying millions to do nothing. It's also pretty clear you aren't getting an all star level player for Simmons. You guys just have to accept the reality and move on from so we can stop wasting time on this stupid issue.
Ben Simmons is innocent
"im also in agreeance that Ben Simmons may well be putting up a sham to offset his duties as a contracted player of the league. However, imagine if he does actually have a mental health issue going on, he gets the help he needs, and actually improves as a player. Sending the 76ers in a deep playoff run and maybe even a chip. That would be insane and quite a comeback story"
"I mean look at them right now, without Embid they are losing. Maxey had two 30+ point games in losses. This is exactly what Ben Simmons wants. Based on how many games Embid is going to miss I expect them to go from 8-5 to 10-8 or 10-9. No reason for concern, but a slip in the standings is definitely reasonable considering how competitive the East is turning out to be."
"Ben Simmons is faking mental health issues to get HIS way and it‚Äôs obvious.   But I do agree Lebron James, Steph, Dame are all great role models. I shouldn‚Äôt even have to say I didn‚Äôt mean every single nba player but you can‚Äôt act like some of these guys don‚Äôt act like overgrown rich teenagers."
"Ben Simmons needs to grow some balls at this point and let it go. He is getting paid tens of millions of dollars, so he can take a bit of criticism. Everyone would have forgotten about it anyways."
Ben Simmons would never
"Look at Steph Curry, a loving father to his kids and a faithful husband. Look at LeBron, exact same thing. LOOK AT DERRICK ROSE, overcoming a fall from grace and accepting his role as a FATHER. Ben Simmons is a 25-year-old who just had a city of millions rip him, destroy his confidence, and wreck is psyche, and all you can see is a ""little hissy fit."" Really disgusting and sad what a lack of empathy you have for these human beings.   Let me be clear, I don't agree with what Ben Simmons is doing ‚Äì¬†I think he should be playing ‚Äì¬†but don't act like facing mental struggles over the brutal reaction he got to that performance makes him not a ""man."" Your jealousy is showing, and it's horrifically ugly"
wait so how does this post relate to Ben Simmons?
at least they got a ring lmao unlike the sixers who have ben simmons
"You‚Äôre a moron lol. You literally posted asking how likely is Ben Simmons to resign in the event of a trade, not if he was worth resigning. Guess that system out in the sticks you went to isn‚Äôt so hot huh?"
Ben Simmons experience is literally identical to getting in a traumatic car wreck. Accept it
Ben Simmons is George in disguise?
"I couldn't disagree more. There are 100s of NBA players who have the physical ability to shoot like Steph and only one that has the mental ability. And that's him. But that's besides the point. You're arguing you can do things physically even if you can't mentally and that's just ridiculous. They work together. If Ben Simmons can't mentally play basketball, he can't play basketball."
"What? Why would a doctor risk their license, their career and prison for Ben Simmons to make $30M?"
"Sure, the Sixers have fined him any time they thought Simmons did something wrong. But usually that fine is just a way of inconveniencing Ben and is quickly remedied. Look no further than the issue of withholding information. Ben got paid for the first few weeks of the season, then the Sixers announce the fine for withholding info, and Ben turns around and complies with the Sixers demand. Easy, he can now get paid again for virtually no work.  As it stands right now, the Sixers can lob occasional fines for when Ben slips up with technical obligations, but there seems to be no way to stop him in the long run from sitting out while getting paid. Which is what prompts me to believe Silver would have to step in."
"Rich Paul just seems like a slimey agent who actually doesn‚Äôt have his players interests as a priority. Pretty sure Ben Simmons was told to sit out and it backfired. Ben doesn‚Äôt seem like the guy to just quit on the team all together. The criticism was rough, but he‚Äôs been hearing for a while."
"I‚Äôm all for athletes and sports organizations treating mental health just like physical injuries. However, it leaves a sour taste in my mouth that it seems Ben Simmons is weaponizing mental health to force a trade."
A Hunter + Reddish and picks deal would only happen if the Hawks are getting a Zion/Brown/Shai type of player. Certainly not Ben Simmons.
"I didn't think we would be number 1 or 2, but a lot of our fans thought we would be the 3 or 4 seed behind Nets and Bucks plus a wildcard team. We had decent defense last season at 12th and we boosted it a lot with just Caruso and Lonzo while Billy has been shown to be a great defensive coach. We were desperately missing a ball handler/passer which Caruso and Lonzo both fit. Need another scorer/closer. Demar fit that. Last season we picked up Vooch who is our man in the middle. Ceiling-wise I thought we could compete with any team just from a complete team aspect and talent wise.  Our team looked good and minus the Bucks and Nets, I didn't really see another team in the eat that was stacking up well. Philly have the Ben Simmons issue, Celtics are inconsistent and have fundamental issues with their starts, Hawks got nerfed by foul changes, Bucks and Nets have injury issues.  Hell, I even had a write up about this. It's half serious, but my viewpoint stands for a lot of it.  https://np.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/qb4mts/why_the_bulls_are_going_to_take_the_number_1_seed/"
Look like Ben Simmons. First sign of things not going their way and they throw little hissy fits.
"You‚Äôre literally copying and pasting what you‚Äôve already said, yet I‚Äôm the one repeating my stance‚Ä¶ I also find it hilarious that you feel the need to downvote each one of my responses üòÇ I think you‚Äôre trying too hard to make a moot point and are misinterpreting the question if we can go back to that (remember, we‚Äôre not trying to move goal posts. See, I read your posts!) Does Ben Simmons have a mental disability preventing him from playing basketball? According to Simmons, the answer is yes. Something mental is disabling him from playing basketball. You‚Äôre saying we can‚Äôt call what he is going through a mental disability, because that‚Äôs not how you like to use that term. I‚Äôm saying that that kind of mentality belittles what people with mental health issues could be going through. If you can get on disability because of some mental health issue you have going on, you are mentally disabled. Don‚Äôt know how that can be misconstrued but I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find something to copy and paste from your first post to try."
"I don't see how this makes the NBA look bad unless they were insisting he play.  The only issue here is Ben Simmons thinks the 76ers are on the hook for MILLIONS because he's having an issue.  Lets say for the moment it's legit, the 76ers shouldn't have to pay that amount of money.  If you wanna put something into the CBA for like a player stipend for players who make less if they need to take a break that's fine but this is ridiculous."
It feels like Ben Simmons is the answer for the timberwolves tbh. Get the guard who can defend he doesn‚Äôt need to shoot because KAT is one of the best shooting bigs of all time.
"That was far different. Raptors went into rebuild mode after making the EC semis, Vince had no choice. Ben Simmons is holding out because he got his feelings hurt."
"This is just a smart narrative play by Ben Simmons' team. It's a strategy.  It's funny - when this thing was initially blowing up, and well before the season started, Bill Simmons said on his podcast that (Ben) Simmons and his team were handling this wrong, and it would be a much smarter play for them to make this into a mental health thing, that would help avoid the damage to his reputation and avoid him looking like the bad guy. He was shopped around in the Harden trade talks, that hurt his confidence, and he wasn't himself in the playoffs and had all these things going through his head, and then the criticism, and how because of all that he's just not in the right place mentally, etc.  I don't know if it's just a coincidence or whether the Klutch guys actually listen to Bill Simmons regularly, but here we are, and looks like Rich Paul and company are doing almost exactly what Bill (half-jokingly) suggested."
for Ben Simmons? lmao
It‚Äôs sad that dumb lazy pieces of shit like Ben Simmons get paid millions of dollars to do anything in this world.
Ben simmons for russell westbrick
I think my original comment you're responding to got taken out of the context I meant it in. I tend to agree that Ben Simmons is abusing the situation. I was responding to the more generalized statement that you want to use the excuse of being mentally unfit to never have to work again.  Schizophrenia runs in my family so I've just seen the dark side of people being literally incapable of holding a job or being functional.
I‚Äôm here for my obligatory FUCK Ben Simmons.
"OP ain‚Äôt no warriors fan if he thinks there any chance in hell we trade Kalyn Thompson, and our entire future lineup for mother f**king Ben choke Simmons. Even with KAT that‚Äôs a bunk ass trade."
"No one knows.   To me, all of his behavior screams that he has some major anxiety and/or depression. His actions are illogical. If someone is of sound mind, you expect their decisions to make some sense at least. To you and me, if Simmons was to return and play, we figure he'd get some boos for a few games, but if he plays well, it'll subside and no one will care after a few weeks. Who knows what he is thinking about it though - he may be so anxious he thinks that bodily harm will come to him. If that sounds crazy to you, that's the point! Anxiety makes you irrational. Remember when they said they were worried about groups of fans planning to bombard Ben entering the Sixers facility?  Or maybe he's very depressed and literally doesn't care about basketball right now. He just came off of a terrible playoff performance, has been dragged through the mud by the media and fans, heard his own coach express doubt about his capabilities, was almost traded a year ago, and he has zero control over where he plays for the next 4 years. To you and me, we're thinking ""you get paid a boatload of money, the team knows you want to be traded, so just keep your head down, play, and show teams that you're still a great player and you'll get paid, and trade offers will come"". To someone who (right now) doesn't care about the game, or their career, or even getting paid, they don't want to do anything.   This has gone well beyond a simple trade demand."
"Here is the trade in question:  &gt;**Boston Celtics** receive: Karl-Anthony Towns  &gt;**Philadelphia 76ers** receive: Jaylen Brown and Patrick Beverley  &gt;**Minnesota Timberwolves** receive: Ben Simmons, Robert Williams III, Matisse Thybulle, Jaden Springer and 2022 first-round pick (from PHI)"
"Oh ya, I‚Äôm sure Ben Simmons is really suffering while clubbing in LA with several million dollars. He must be REALLY emotionally suffering."
"Nor should he at this stage.  This is an internal squabble between a player and his organization that he is under contract with.  As long as Philly plays by the rules in the CBA, there's really nothing more for Adam Silver to say or do.  Trying to curb stomp Ben Simmons use of mental health is a *huge* misstep for the NBA and *exactly* what Rich Paul is trying to get them to do so they can turn the narrative against the Sixers and the NBA."
I guess ben simmons is just better at business then
"This is clearly a PR ploy by them. The team has already asked for a copy of his mental health records so their own expert can evaluate it, which I understand is what they‚Äôre supposed to do under the CBA. They have not done shit. It would be completely improper for the team to send out a questionnaire asking a bunch of mental health questions as a way to bypass getting his medical records. So don‚Äôt buy this bullshit.   What‚Äôs really infuriating here is the damage that Ben Simmons is doing to future NBA players who may actually have mental health issues and need time off from the team to deal with it. He is trying to take advantage of a loophole, but by doing so he is setting fire to the barn. I really wish players would start speaking up against this. How can they not realize how bad this is going to go for them at the next CBA negotiations?"
&gt;Ben Simmons believes the 76ers‚Äô tactics are worsening his mental health instead of supporting him  he's right 100%
Doc fucked up probably shouldn't have said idk but you could tell embiid was sick and tired of babying Simmons after game 7.  Should he have put the blame on Simmons? Probably not during an interview it should've been in private but at some point either he steps up to the pressure or he falls off. Right now he's showing he can't handle it and it's not due to mental health it's just the mental toughness of Ben
They can't even deal with Ben Simmons being a mopey bitch.
"It‚Äôs hilarious, that all this shit is stemming from one guy playing like shit in the playoffs  That‚Äôs all that happened. He sucked. Yeah his team didn‚Äôt have the most loving response, but they didn‚Äôt do anything bad enough to ruin the relationship like this   I even called Ben Simmons pulling the depression card months ago. People were wondering how he would be allowed to sit games and still be paid, mental health is the easiest trick in the book"
Simmons literally forced Embid (the superior player) to change his game to accomodate Simmons. Simmons has literally not improved at all in his time there and flat out refuses to even try and better himself. If my coworker spends years giving half ass effort and im busting my balls every day for YEARS imma feel a way about it. Ben Simmons created this situation for himself. Embids gonna miss out on competing for a ship in his prime because Bens baby soft
"This makes no sense lmao. Rockets are asking John to not play while Sixers are asking Simmons to play. It‚Äôs polar opposite.. Ben is saying he‚Äôs not fit to play and still wants his check, but sixers are for proof that he can‚Äôt play like any reasonable employee would and Ben is playing this publicly."
"yeah I don't agree at all, Ben Simmons is choosing to test the mental health path as a shield and is failing pretty consistently. The fact he bothered to show up at all I feel is indicative that his path is not working. Adam Silver knows this will resolve itself in the sixers' favor and so intervening would look far worse than doing nothing."
"Lol, the 76's draft the shittiest players. Besides Embiid who we can equate to bad luck with injuries, but still.  Imagine drafting Embiid with the 3rd overall pick in 2014. Okafor with the 3rd overall pick in 2015.  Then with the number 1 overall pick in 2016 Ben Simmons, and then Markelle Fultz the following year with the number 1 overall pick."
"Well consider the backlash and hate behind it, I would say no. He will never enjoy basketball again. This will haunt Ben Simmons for the rest of his career"
Name 1 team that Ben Simmons is the #1 point guard where he wins a championship and don't say no stacked ass teams.
"Backing them up on Kyrie how? By following the CBA to the letter? Kyrie is still getting half his multi million dollar paycheck by sitting on his couch 24/7 and tweeting nonsense and no one is constantly on his ass as much as they are on Ben Simmons.   And as for having the majority of players vaccinated isn‚Äôt a triumph of the organization. Most players decided to get vaxxed because a) it‚Äôs the non idiotic thing to do healthwise, b) peer and public pressure."
"Im glad he is representing Australia well, God knows how bad their image got with Ben Simmons and kyrie"
"&gt;No.  &gt;They were 7-3 after 10gms, last year. So the difference is too miniscule to aid your stance here.  It's a fact that 8-2 missing multiple key players is better than 7-3.  &gt;No.  &gt;The difference is too miniscule to aid your stance here.  Wait until I tell you that in those four games that Embiid was out, there was a useless max slot and another max player missed 3 of the 4 games.  &gt;Simmons defense is what wins games along with this playmaking, those are huge reasons why Philly was a #1 seed. No matter how many 30pts games, Maxey cannot supply that nor anything else to substitute that on a level which wins more games than Simmons' skillset won for Philly.  Nah Embiid protecting the paint is why Ben was able to be aggressive on defense. They were 8-9 last year with Ben playing and Embiid out. A below .500 record wouldn't get you a #1 seed for sure. Ben becomes a liability in the playoffs and is a huge reason why Philly was a 2nd round exit."
"It matters for seeding which is *hugely* important. Simmons' free throw shooting in the playoffs was an anomaly yet everyone is acting like that's how he has shot free throws his entire career, he shot 65% in his last 8 regular season games so it's not as if he was coming off a bad stretch. What happened in the Hawks series was also borderline historical, if not an actual historical first...they choked leads of 18 points and 26 points in consecutive playoff games. Any other year they win those games and the series is won 4-1. So really it was a combination of an anomalous run of poor free throw form from one of their top players as well as an historical choke that would unlikely be repeated if they keep Simmons...especially given the kick up the pants that this series *should* be for him. If this doesn't get him to change, nothing ever will and then you can move on. Trading him for anyone other than a true superstar like Lillard or a scoring stud like Beal would be a pointless exercise as he may very well turn his game around and there would be nothing worse than downgrading your team, watching them bomb out in the first round and then seeing a much improved Simmons playing for someone else. So in that respect I see Morey swinging for the fences and if he doesn't hit a home run with a Lillard level player he's going to stick with Ben for another season, possibly holding a gun to his head while he stands there practicing right handed free throws for hours and hours on end."
"All Star appearances are used too often. It‚Äôs a half season award, so it doesn‚Äôt even carry that much weight. The season Kawhi won the FMVP with the Spurs, he wasn‚Äôt an All-Star but it would be the equivalent of like 4 All-Star appearances.  Just look at this season. Trae wasn‚Äôt an All Star. Ben Simmons was. Will anyone say Trae had a worst season than Simmons? No, but history would say so if you just looked at All-Star appearances from this season."
"Hope SexLand can carve definitive pg and sg roles.      I like Okoro at sf     Keep Allen at center     that leaves pf with the question mark. Love needs to go. let him find happiness somewhere &amp; replace him thru the draft (idk much about this drafft, so take a sf/pf combo that can shoot)    The bench is Nance, Wade, Osman &amp; Prince. Need to find a capable backup pg (delly can ast but his scoring is shit)                    WILD STUPID TAKE- trade sexton, Garland, love, #3 &amp; filler picks in some 4 team deal for Buddy Hield, Gallinari &amp; Ben Simmons.       Do i even want that? No!!!"
"There are no more than a handful of superstars in the league, people have a very liberal definition of that term. Yet there are 30 players in this league who earned more than Simmons this season. You all think that Ben earning $29m is the biggest salary in the NBA or something ridiculous like that, it's not even close. And Simmons isn't on $33m, not sure where you got that from, he was on $29m this season and will be earning $31m next. There will be 33 players earning $30m or more next season. That's more players than there are All Star berths.            An NBA season is more about one round of the playoffs. There is no way the Sixers get the #1 seed if Simmons wasn't on the team. You replace him with someone like DLo, Brogden or any fringe All Star player and the Sixers are a middle of the pack team. Being a 6 seed is quite a different proposition to being a one seed. He may suck in the playoffs (moreso the second round) but his style of play gets you wins in the season proper and you absolutely need that to get a good seed and an easier path in the post season. What's the good of having a slightly better offensive player in a series when your first round opponent is much better than what you would have otherwise *and* has home court advantage?               I agree that Simmons' style of play isn't getting you deep in the playoffs as it is but at least it's getting you into the second round. To get past that they need more than a DLo or Brogden or even a McCollum. They need a bonafide superstar running mate for Embiid (or at least a fringe superstar ie top 5-10 guy), mainly because the mountain they have to climb next season will likely include a healthy Nets team with KD-Harden-Kyrie. Embiid+McCollum+Tobias aint getting you over the Nets. So the least they should be hoping for is a Beal but moreso someone like Lillard and I don't think that's happening. Their hopes literally hang on the Nets having two of their guys injured again in the post season and that seemed more of an anomaly than anything and unlikely to happen again."
What's the difference between Ben Simmons and an incel? About a foot.
"And if you fuck with Ben Simmons, then fuck you too"
Ben Simmons is lame for not joining the team. Would‚Äôve been a perfect chance to expand his range in actual games
That makes me very happy. Sorry for attacking you like that. I must‚Äôve gotten confused with what hes been saying and what some Boston sports radio guys have been saying because they still want to move Jaylen for basically anyone with the most recent being Ben Simmons.
get ready everyone ... You know Ben Simmons?   Bad Simmons! üòÅü§£ü§£
Are you sure? This sub was saying even Marcus Smart is better than Ben Simmons and I got downvoted for disagreeing lmao.
but according to r/sixers a bag of chips is better than Ben Simmons...
"I would trade Ben Simmons for a used condom, a Vanilla Coke, and 15% off my auto insurance."
Ben Simmons had never lost to the Knicks. Let us have that at least
I like that in 2k the sixers always become a 7 year dynasty with Ben Simmons and Joel dominating the east.
"Well, it depends. If he gets a jump shot, he'll be fantastic. If he has the same weird shit set shot, he'll be a better Ben Simmons without the mental issues."
Ben Simmons missing FTs like Edmure Tully and the funeral arrows
Or maybe people think Ben Simmons is an all nba player because he's been an all nba player
"In one 4-game series against Miami, Brogdon made 25 free throws in 28 attempts.  This year in the playoffs, Ben Simmons made 25 free throws in 73 attempts."
"Ben Simmons is the best.. because Basketball is scored like Golf, and the goal is to get the lowest score possible."
Imagine the fan reaction if Ben Simmons is traded for an all star.
"This is my draft order: Jaylen, Jamal Murray, Brandon Ingram, Ben Simmons.  Tbh you could probably swap between Jamal and Ingram depending on what a team needs. Jamal's shined a bit brighter so far, but I'm confident BI will still end up being a great player."
D'Angelo Russell for Ben Simmons.
"LMAO!  Ben has fallen off so much that a team legit offered Malcolm Brogdon and a mid-first pick for him?!?   Just want to point out yet again that I was told repeatedly how stupid I was for saying the Sixers should offer Simmons and whatever picks/role players it took to get Kawhi, LeBron, Harden, etc. LBJ seemed set on going to LA for reasons not involving basketball, but the Sixers very realistically could have had either of the other two. But, nope. Don't want to give up a young PG that...can't/won't shoot. Better wait until he makes more money, gets older and still can't/won't shoot."
"Simmons, DLo, Edwards, KAT.   I absolutely think they would. DLo and Ben are like kATs two best friends on top of it"
"Agreed. Plus, there's no way Ben Simmons would stay in a small market like Indiana. He's on Klutch Sports and dated a Kardashian. Once he becomes a FA, he'd be gone."
"I mean, OG is pretty much equal to Ben in that regard too. Simmons is the better player, but you can't really have perimeter defense as an argument when they do virtually the same in that regard."
That Nick Anderson part had a lot of parallels to Ben Simmons this year
Ben simmons........oh you said missed watching.....thought you said watching missed shots
"Ben Simmons, especially after the 76ers series against us and Tyler Herro especially after the Bucks series"
"A fellow Pacers fan arguing that another franchise should ""settle for mediocrity"" is NOT a good look lmao. I for one am ready to STOP settling for mediocrity.  Completely unrelated but Idk if you saw: we offered Brogdon and a 1st for Ben Simmons which Philly understandably turned down, but I like the idea that we know we gotta make something happen and are seemingly trying to. I would not be shocked if there's a roster switch up by season start."
Recent Game 7 for Ben Simmons
Milwaukee and Philly are two very different cities and Ben Simmons is not Giannis.
As a Raps fan I'd dig this but you think Minnesota is giving up 2 firsts plus for Ben Simmons? No chance
Looks like Ben Simmons is not going anywhere.
"Harden sneaking off to the brothels after demanding a direct horse to House Nets.   Some kind of scenario about Giannis‚Äô free throws‚Ä¶ him taking too long, someone finding the rule in the library thing (where Samwell was, it‚Äôs been a while) then the league shhing it.   No one taking House Suns or Hawks seriously.  Then of course‚Ä¶ Ben Simmons."
"They have the athletes to at least qualify and get somewhere but lack the system and culture since it's not a big part of the culture there. Imagine a team if most of the players, coaches, etc. have basically a Ben Simmons level of motivation for the game. They could be the best athletes in the world but it won't amount to much."
"So many comments saying there isn‚Äôt an allstar a team would trade for ben, they seem to be reading this as ‚Äúmorey will only make a 1:1 trade between ben simmons and an allstar caliber player‚Äù. I‚Äôm pretty sure if they find the right guy we‚Äôll give up a lot more than just simmons for him. And i‚Äôm pretty sure a package with simmons will be more appealing to GMs then brogdon and an extra 1st that maybe would have been for this year (no article has specifics about the 1st round pick part of the trade).  In a sport where you can trade away future 1st round picks out the wazoo i‚Äôm not sure one extra is more valuable than having simmons in your trade package."
"Ben Simmons desperately working on his shot, confirmed."
You see this with people saying Ben Simmons is aggression away from being Giannis. He'd still not have the touch or footwork to get him there. That's what makes Giannis amazing.
"What is with the selective reading around here?  Did you not see where I said ""argue keeping Sabonis, put Ben at SF.""  And I stand by this part: No matter where Ben Simmons go, if he's your primary ball handler, they will always underachieve.  he needs to be moved off the ball...develop him off the ball."
"Ben Simmons and Fox (fast guy, point guard for the kings, I don‚Äôt wanna butcher his first name lol)"
Ben Simmons isn't an all star caliber player. Who TF gonna trade an all star for that bum?
"It is crazy to watch this subreddit seriously consider Brogdon + 1 round for Simmons a good trade. Think I need to unfollow for awhile.   Too many fantasy basketball managers who think Ben Simmons is soooooo bad, but still want him on their team and think Will Barton and a couple of picks would be ‚Äúclose.‚Äù"
That's really selling low on Ben Simmons Big men typically take longer to come into their own in the NBA. Simmons might play as a guard but he's a really big man. Plus other than one whole season Ben's been on the court a lot. His availability is low-key underappreciated.  Brogdon is 28. He may have juicy skills now. His game may age really well. Buuuut Simmons' value to me is closer in the range of CJ or Middleton/Holiday than Malcom Brogdon and a pick. If Indiana stays healthy or makes any more move after this trade they could win a lot of games with Simmons &amp; Carlisle in tow. That pick might be a late first rounder.  Sabonis &amp; Simmons would have been a lot of fun to watch. Shame
"I disagree. Teams in the playoffs most definitely did it. By hunting I mean getting mismatched defenders to switch on your best guys. It's relatively easy to do since most top players have great on-ball skills. Other than Suns - Clippers and Clippers - Utah (which was more of a team-wide adjustment for the clippers than hunting specific players), it's happened every series in the West. Hell, the Clippers even had a stretch where they ran a bunch of plays for Cousins, when Ayton was off the floor. A significant part of this Jazz' issues, both historically and now, is that they can't exploit mismatches with Gobert if the teams switch a weak wing on him.  The Bucks did it themselves with Holiday, but not nearly as much as they should've. Running P&amp;Rs with Giannis as the screener for Middleton or Holiday shouldn't be nearly the exotic concept it seems to be for Milwaukee. The Sixers don't really have the personnel to do it with Ben Simmons being Ben Simmons..."
"Kawhi destroyed the Sixers, yes, but had a noticeably harder time when Simmons played on him.   Quoting an article from the time re: Ben on Leonard:  ‚ÄúHe has now held Leonard to 12-of-25 shooting (0-of-9 from 3) and two turnovers through two games.‚Äù  ‚Äú For context of just how big an impact Simmons has made, consider Leonard has torched the rest of the Sixers with 17-of-22 shooting (6-of-8 from 3) and only one turnover. Without Simmons, Leonard would have been walking towards another 40- to 50-point game.‚Äù  Scorers gonna score. The key is to make them inefficient at least. Ben doesn‚Äôt give you as much on offense but he can at least slow down  other players."
"Ah sorry didn't mean you specifically. It's been all ""if you do illegal drugs you will DIE"" in responses to my other comments. I forget how much people are indoctrinated to be fearful about some drugs but not others.  Fully with you on that! I actually do think Ben Simmons could benefit from dissolving his ego for a few hours. The fear is just in your head, Ben..."
Lol I'd trade for Ben Simmons...maybe Ingram...
"And the Sixers ""are excited"" to work with Ben Simmons..."
"the 2016 Draft Class had 2 rookie of the years. One is Malcolm Brogdon, the other is Ben Simmons"
If you can fix Lonzo Ball you can fix Ben Simmons. Just have to trade him
**Ben Simmons stock low.** Someone offering a first this early tells me his embarrassment series won't tank him. Maybe the Mavericks are still in the habit of signing max contracts to players that don't deserve them?   I hope Philly keeps this dude. And he wins a 'ship next year. Then 20 years later we find out something happened to make him dive.
"&gt; Brogdon+Embiid &gt; Simmons+Embiid  Honestly, I disagree. That duo isn't making an ECF. Yall are seriously overrating Brogdan or underrating Ben. Maybe both."
Lame answer but honestly Ben Simmons.  Thought if he was so damn good his team would at least make the NCAA tournament....
"I dont like russ's game in general and i dont love him w joel....    But id probably agree w you. Signifigantly improves philly I think.  I moreso think the Wiz may feel some hesitancy, didnt realize Ben has a 15% trade kicker. But nonetheless tbh, your probably not doing better than a Ben Simmons return for WB, and given the age disparity it may not be a bad move for them.   Also a Beal/Simmons team theoretically works? Its a kinda interesting fake trade to me"
People here think ben simmons is an all nba player even though he's not a good scorer and has never improved that aspect of his game since he's been in the league. Nevermind the fact that he cant shoot a ball
I didn't like Ben Simmons once I found out he returned his dog.
Ben Simmons for the last 4 years
Ben Simmons.
"If and ONLY if the Suns win the NBA Finals, I'd be intrigued to see what a deal centered around CP and Ben Simmons could look like. Probably a super unpopular thought though."
this is only rumors sixers will keep ben simmons
I‚Äôm a perfect work you‚Äôre right. But they‚Äôre not going to find anyone willing to trade a player like that away for Ben Simmons.
All of the goodwill Ben Simmons had got transmuted over to the Hawks.
"These lillard takes are a bit ridiculous Imo. If they trade him for anything it becomes rebuild time and it won‚Äôt be for less than a fuck ton of picks.   Way too often people think trade lillard and still try to compete, nah man, the team gets blown the fuck up if he leaves in any fashion. Nurkic already came out and said as much, lillard gone and he‚Äôll be the next traded, then probably anyone else of value.  and for whatever they‚Äôd want to build post lillard, it is definitely not a team being built around Ben Simmons."
ben simmons stans just use titles like that &amp; avoid talking about his actual play which is hilarious
Ben Simmons in shambles
&gt; They need someone who will make a difference in a run for a title. It‚Äôs been shown Ben is ultimately ineffective if that‚Äôs your goal.  I totally agree but I would say most people on /r/ripcity don't. I think that Simmons might raise our regular season floor but he lowers our playoff floor relative to CJ.
You hear that league? Ben Simmons is WANTED. He is an ASSET. And you would be LUCKY to have him.
"I agree with you for the most part but I might even take Embiid and Simmons over Simmon, Sabonis, Brogdan.  They blew it like 3 out of the last 4 years but I don't think Philly fans realize how lucky they are to have a team that is contending to make the finals every year and how easily the could turn into a team that is lucky to even make the playoffs most years or even have to go into a full rebuild. Unless I'm offered something that I think I would win a title with, I'm not taking it. Right now Dame and Kawhi are the only potential guys out there that I think fit that for sure.  Maybe what Ben needs is a vet to come in and help build his confidence like CP3 did with Ayton and Booker.  Maybe Philly should try to add Lowry to Simmons and Embiid instead of trying to get rid of Simmons."
"Ben Simmons hate is bordering on a mental illness now. Like, how fucking stupid of a comment is this. This subs opinion on him is absurd."
"Sorry, I didn‚Äôt realize I was talking to Ben Simmons‚Äô trainer. Clearly you know exactly how much work Simmons has put in. My mistake."
"It looks like money wise this works:  Philly gets: CJ McCollum  Indy gets: Ben Simmons  Portland gets: Domantas Sabonis, Justin Holiday"
If you have literally any aspersions of having a deep playoff run you do not want Ben Simmons and his terrible contract.  He will not help you in the playoffs. He will hurt you. He has proven than year after year and somehow casuals like you fail to see that.
"Im telling you why a GM would value Ben Simmons higher than the fans do. You have made it very clear you believe he is a trasg player and a negative asset. Im telling you, someone else out there sees it differently and his value is much higher than trash. Potential has value whether you think it does or not"
&gt;	So in your opinion 24 year old kids are what they are and can‚Äôt improve?  Thats silly  You made up a strawman to argue against.  I‚Äôm talking about Ben Simmons and what he‚Äôs shown everyone thus far and how he‚Äôs earned his reputation and the skepticism and your talking about ‚Äúwell maybe he could be a great player if he goes to another team and changes position.‚Äù  He could be.  He could not.  It could be the start of a whole new round of ‚Äúwhat if‚Äôs.‚Äù
"Some more than others.  There are proven commodities in this league.  You know what you‚Äôre getting with a Lebron, Durant or Kawhi.  Ben Simmons going to a different team and changing his role is a bigger question mark.  It shouldn‚Äôt be weird to point that out."
"ya fans often do this and its sad but you have to just ignore it. At the end of the day you can break down every championship run and point out flaws. Mostly because fans attach themselves to either a single super star or franchise. They then basically want to downplay everyone/thing else to uplift the party they support.  I think it might be because a whole generation grew up watching idiots like Skip Bayless and use his methods of argument (To uplift MJ, he has to insult LBL and Pippen). Some people dont realize they do this and some are just out to troll.  Also NBA fans have the memory span of a gold fish, just you wait until Ben Simmons has a decent 10 game stretch next season...theyll start clowning Philly if they do end up trading him at the start of the season. It happens every year with multiple players (lately with Paul George, Ben Simmons)"
&gt;The Sixers have already fielded offers for Ben Simmons but continue to hold a stance that **they will only trade him for an all-star caliber player.**  Good luck with that.
Maybe for value. Ben Simmons is a buy low candidate right now but you could probably get a lot for Sabonis depending on the team.
Ben Simmons is just a taller Ricky Rubio... and brogdon and a first is as good as its gonna get for them.
"I‚Äôd do it in a heart beat. I‚Äôm sure some people think it benefits the 76ers more, but I‚Äôm still high on Ben Simmons.  You can‚Äôt teach that type of size and athleticism. He‚Äôs still very young and the magic Johnson comparisons will only get stronger as he ages.  Who knows how good SGA will be, but I have no doubt Ben Simmons will be in the hall of fame."
"Ben Simmons is ass, and 7ers are fucking idiots thinking they can get a lottery pick or all-start caliber playet for him. Tony Allen is better than Ben Simmons."
"Everyone on the league knows Morey is great at analysing player value.   Everyone also knows that very soon after Morey left, the rockets wanted nothing to do with Simmons in a Harden trade, while Morey wanted to get off him badly. Rockets stance was probably based on a valuation dating to Morey's time with the team.   So, tanking and getting almost nothing else for Harden was better than Ben Simmons.  And that was before his playoff disaster.   Philly isn't going to get an all-star for him, and if they don't trade him by the start of the season, Klutch will force a trade to the Lakers for KCP, Tucker and a pick."
The Ben Simmons disrespect is insane. Dude is 24 and is a DPOY caliber player.
"Well it's a good thing for us Dame doesn't legit want out.  What about what Embiid wants?  He's tired of trying to compensate for Ben's shortcomings.  Is he really going to be ok with running it back hoping Ben figures it out or Portland shits the bed hard enough to make Dame demand a trade?  Is Dame for Simmons even the best trade out there for Portland if they decide to blow it up?  Besides if Dame leaves Nurk leaves, CJ will probably want out too, we won't want to rebuild around a guy who's mentally weak."
Lol what is going on here ? Sga is not better then Ben Simmons. When has he ever been an all star or all NBA or all defense or dpoy
"*Disclaimer: My take on this*  It sounds like a trade deadline offer from Indy. This in no way shape or form makes sense for Indy now as opposed to a couple months ago. I have 0 inside information on this season. but I'm willing to bet that Brogdon was one of the lead guys in the locker room that had a problem with Bjorkgren before that situation boiled all the way over. He's a smart guy and I can see him having a Philadelphia Jimmy-style problem with Indy's coaching staff. Especially in a year where they underperformed internal expectations the math adds up for me.  This however makes 0 sense now because Ben Simmons is the least Carlisle-like guard i think i have ever seen whereas Carlisle would love a guy like Brogdon. The Mavs brought Delon Wright in and then Wright quickly fell out of Carlisle's rotation because Wright was very deferential and indecisive in Dallas. At the end of the Dirk era on Carlisle has built a very guard reliant system predicated on quick decisions and conviction where the guard decides to go with the ball. Luka embodies this now, before Luka it was DSJ and other aggressive score first guards like Barea, Beaubois, and Monta Ellis he really personally gravitated to (even Jalen Brunson). I can't think of a single $20 mil.+ guard that fits that description worse than Ben Simmons.  I think Philly is releasing this now as a smokescreen to artificially prop Simmons' value up because Brogdon, Lamb, and a first may very well be where Simmons' value currently tops out"
"Bro...  Just because I am not on the ""shit on Ben Simmons"" bandwagon, doesn't mean I'm a ""Benabler"". One can be in the middle.  Do I think he has problems? Yeah. Do I think he's only worth Brogdon and a non-lottery pick? HELL NO. I am fascinated by people who pretend like everything is alright with him, but I am even more fascinated by people who think he's all of a sudden a bench scrub after a down year.  Melo got tossed from the league for a year as well, despite the fact that everybody knew damn well what a player he is and what he can do. Same nearly became the case for Reggie Jackson. And now you're all doing it to Simmons. What's next, Klay comes back, doesn't immediately average 22.3 PPG like he did in his best scoring season, and he suddenly becomes a scrub? Come on."
300 people co-signed this?? üòÇü§£ This sub is casual city   Lol @  accommodating a lesser player and getting rid of the best player of the 3‚Ä¶to give more space for a Ben Simmons-Myles Turner duo
Ben Simmons is fine at the 4. No need to get rid of him.
"He improved defensively and severely regressed on offense. His shooting has always been a problem. 4 years in it‚Äôs obvious he‚Äôs not working on improving.   Scouting From 2016:  ‚ÄúOn the downside, Simmons made one three-pointer (three attempts) all season and shot 67 percent from the free-throw line. His jump-shooting development will be a popular talking point early in his career.  Weaknesses  Any conversation about weaknesses starts with his jumper. He showed little confidence in his shooting ability, and opponents took notice. Defenders would eventually begin to sag in an attempt to take away the drive and bait him into pulling up. Simmons would often pass on open jumpers to either give up the ball or force a drive.  Mechanically, he shoots on the way down and will no doubt have adjustments to make to his form. Executives must decide whether he'll improve, and if not, how it will affect or bring down his NBA value.  Defensively, his effort was visibly poor at certain times throughout the year. He didn't contest inside shots he could have. A below-average 7'0 ¬º"" wingspan (for his size) doesn't help his cause.  A disaster finish to the year also raised some concerns over his competitiveness. During losses, particularly LSU's last one of the season (lost by 33 to Texas A&amp;M), Simmons looked disinterested and indifferent, which may turn off general managers who value intensity and killer instinct.‚Äù  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2636326-2016-nba-draft-prospects-breaking-down-pro-future-of-lsus-ben-simmons"
"Easy to judge the numbers but the nets were a 6 seed, going against the sixers. He was literally being guarded by jimmy butler or Ben Simmons the entire series, or meeting Embiid at the rim. Im just saying he‚Äôs a talented player which we all know he is because of the numbers he can put up. If you think he hasn‚Äôt matured and gotten better since that series ur probably wrong."
"Career 32% from a 7 footer as if thats bad? As opposed to a player who doesn‚Äôt warrant a single defender anywhere on the perimeter. The main issue here is that Ben is and has always been overrated, and Sabonis is criminally underrated at this point. I stand by my comment. Put Simmons on Indiana and see how well it goes for him without a stacked roster."
do Sixers with Kyle Lowry and no Ben Simmons win the chip?
"id take brogdon over ben, i think you're overrating simmons he is bad"
Ben Simmons
A Pistons fan on twitter said they wouldn't trade **anyone** on the Pistons roster for Ben Simmons
"I trust Morey to get the most out of this situation.  If the Sixers are able to pull an all-star for Ben Simmons, they will remain competitive for the title.  If not, 2nd round exits are as good as it gets."
"FFS did people really forget that Simmons, on his day, is a triple double machine with elite level defense?  And he's 24, not 32, he can fix his shooting. If Brook fucking Lopez managed to go from 0 made threes in a season to being called ""Splash Mountain"", I'm pretty sure someone of Ben Simmons' talent can turn himself into, at the very least, an average shooter, and that combined with everything else he brings to the table would make him worth more tham Brogdon and a first rounder which will more likely than not be out of the lottery.  Well fucking done Morey for saying hell no to this package. Sure, Simmons had a shit year, but if that is enough to turn him from a centerpiece for a James bloody Harden trade to Brogdon plus a single goddamn non-lottery pick then this sport is honestly far more idiotic than I thought.  However, if they plan on keeping Doc, they really have two options. One is to trade away Simmons, the other is to lock him in the gym until he's capable of hitting 40/100 threes and 85/100 free throws. And I'd much rather attempt the latter first because I feel Simmons is worth the effort."
Lol Danny green told the press Ben Simmons isn‚Äôt the kind of guy to improve on things without getting pressure.   Maybe! It‚Äôs a possibility. If that‚Äôs the case they keep him. But there‚Äôs a very real chance it‚Äôs the opposite and then he needs gone
"That's the the thing.  Ben Simmons doesnt need to rehab his value.  The reason his trade value is so low is that for the past 4+ months he has stated he no longer wants to play for the Sixers.  Why would any GM give up anything significant for a player who has stated repeatedly he would never play in a Sixers uniform again?  Let's say Simmons came back and played 20 games, all the while demanding out before and after each game to the press.  Would his value increase at that point? If anything it would go down further.  Only people that loses are the Sixers' players. Instead of playing alongside 30M worth of player/players - they watch that cap space being eaten up for someone who wont even practice with them.  Sixers are 11th in the East and are 10-10 after playing 25% of the season. Not exactly a team that can afford to sit around and wait esp with more injuries to Embiid.  If you follow Morey you understand his desire to ""win"" every transaction and his arrogance surrounding that. Unfortunately that type of attitude is hurting him, the Sixers ownership, and the players and their fanbase.  If he can't figure out a way to deal Simmons, Morey will be gone before Ben is."
"Ben Simmons. The longer the season goes on, the more irrelevant he seems."
Would you do Bledsoe and Mann for ben Simmons?
Ben Simmons‚Ä¶ one of the best passers in the league?
After Ben Simmons looked like Steph in these types of workout videos I‚Äôve refused to believe in them ever since
The reverse Ben simmons
"Ah I see. Lets surround Lebron with Tony Allen, Ben Simmons, Dwight, and Draymond and lets blame Lebron if they dont shoot well from 3.   You really have do have a peanut brain huh lol"
"I mean sure, Boogie was better than Draymond even. That doesn't change my point though. Most teams actively didn't want him because he was a headache. Think about him like you think about Kyrie or Ben Simmons. Good players, but a player most teams would rather not have taking up a max contract even though as players the deserve it."
"I mean I don't measure a player's worth solely by how many rings he has, same way I don't measure a GM. I've been following Morey for a decade now and the way he built those Rockets with no valuable assets to work with was damn impressive. He built the greatest team to never win a title and went toe to toe against the KD Warriors when everyone else was biding their time. His proficiency is undeniable except for the casual fan.   Simmons is under contract for 4 years. Either Sixers get the return they need in order to compete or they keep the All Star they have. Ben wants out, Sixers want a title. It's in their mutual best interest to work together to find a solution. If Ben comes back to play and rehabs his value, he can get what he wants. Otherwise Sixers are willing to let this play out, there's no point in trading him away for pennies on the dollar and closing their title window."
"That doesn‚Äôt mean he is getting fouled. Ben Simmons, for example, drives a lot but he purposely avoids contact so he doesn‚Äôt draw as many fouls as you would want."
Fuck. Ben. Simmons.
Damn rich Paul really paid for this to be made.   Fuck Ben Simmons. I think he‚Äôs causing harm to actual mental advocacy by using it as a way to keep his paycheck without playing.  I don‚Äôt buy his mental health issues for even a second.
"Refuse to play games even when it's garbage time or do a Ben Simmons or Kyrie and say ""I will not suit up with gear made from slave labor"" etc."
Hard disagree. Raptors were literally a lucky bounce away from losing a series against known playoff shitter Ben Simmons as the second option and starter.
"I agree. I think pigeonholing him into a Ben Simmons type is unfair. He's already shown a willingness to score inside and up to the three point line (a willingness to shoot the three too, though not particularly well) and his playmaking flashes are great but frankly his off ball defence is by far the weakest part of his game. He gets lost a lot."
"I agree. Ben Simmons and his team have definitely not handled this well at all, and I honestly get a little bit of suspicion, but it feels like people are determined to believe he‚Äôs faking everything without any consideration for the possibility that he‚Äôs actually telling the truth. Also, I feel like in general ‚Äúyou doing x or saying this is x takes away from people experiencing real x‚Äù takes (e.g. someone complains about racism or sexism) are often the ones doing the discrediting they complain about."
"The issue is that yes, they should break it up and get assets, but you can‚Äôt really get that from a contender that will want dame and CJ. Those picks are worthless. Getting a young star isn‚Äôt much fun either, Better off just throwing shit at Philli, I actually think it‚Äôs one of the only destinations where Ben Simmons would be ok. Make him their big and see what happens. If it‚Äôs shit, just bust it up, you tired."
Where is Ben Simmons when you need him?
"No, that part‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs the totality of everything.   We traded Dwight, CP3 &amp; Russ for him because he wanted Morey to. He went over Morey‚Äôs head to get Russ. We maxed out every single resource we had in order to cater to him and his title window.   Go back and look at how he exited Houston. That‚Äôs where the pandemic portion becomes important. He cared for nobody other than himself, disregarding the health and safety protocols to spite the team.   And his final game was at home. Please go look at that too. You want to know what it could look like if Ben Simmons returned on the road? Harden‚Äôs last game is what it would look like."
Did someone say Ben Simmons? I swear I heard someone say ‚ÄúBen Simmons.‚Äù  You guys?  No?  Oh.  üòí
‚ÄúBen Simmons was seen huddling with the Wolves players during the timeout‚Äù.
"Philly fans wouldn‚Äôt boo you James   Ben Simmons would love it there, seems like the perfect trade üëÄ"
"I know you're being sarcastic but it's crazy people seriously say this and don't look at Embiid's shooting areas this season. 23% of his shots are from 3 this season, without Ben, compared to 17% last season with Ben. Over 70% of his shots are outside the paint without Ben, last season with Ben 'hogging the paint' it was just 55%. So without Simmons, Joel is taking more threes and spending significantly less time in the paint. Completely opposite to the narrative these people are trying to preach..."
"As a person who is really functional with deep mental health issues it really bothers me that almost every Ben Simmons thread is full of highly upvoted ""Him faking this is disrespectful to those with real issues"".   Only one person on Earth truly knows what is going on inside his head and people should realize that everyone en masse calling him a ""fake trying to take advantage of people"" is just as damaging to taking mental health seriously as him possibly faking it."
Ben Simmons would‚Äôve passed
Thats the hard part. Lakers were dumb to take on that contract but anything would be good at this point. I even think ben simmons or john wall would be good. Ben just for defensive purposes.
"It comes with the territory. Him signing the contract affords him quite the lavish lifestyle that he's obviously been enjoying. He'd paid to play for the Sixers and try to win championships.  When is him not doing his part unacceptable? Ben has literally not improved offensively at all in his half-decade in the league. He has constantly deflected criticism of his offensive skills, and loves talking shit about how good his defense is. He has underperformed bigtime, and is making tons of money just to not improve and put his teammates in a shitty situation because his skillset is so limited.  Yeah, I can see Philly fans finally having enough, and the criticism is absolutely justified.  Also, mental health is basically impossible to quantify, so it's a tough situation for league and Philly. But it is telling that Simmons tried weaseling his way out with injury claims, and when that backfired he suddenly felt his mental health was being undermined by Philly.  It very much appears as if he and his team are weaponizing mental health to get what they want. Fuck them for doing it."
"As I get older it's easier to grasp the idea that 2 contradicting points can both hold truth. Ben might be suffering from a form of anxiety and his management team are exploiting this situation now to leverage a trade that has 2 clients flourishing (Simmons and Maxey) in lead roles. I always feel uncomfortable when teams call players 'assets'. Even if they get millions in salary, there is something dehumanizing about it. Both sides should really push to finish this situation quickly since it's already obvious that they are not getting a superstar in return for him"
"Although great on assists this game, this is where Tyrese Maxey just can‚Äôt match Ben Simmons play making ability. The Sixers are hurting."
Ben Simmons' mental health has been mishandled by his own circle.
"But Ben Simmons is done with Philly. It doesn't matter what the sixers do, he's not coming back"
Ben Simmons
Wonder how they‚Äôd feel about a straight up swap for Simmons. Afaik Philly doesn‚Äôt have the same mandates as NY so Kyrie could play and he‚Äôd be a pretty damn good pair with Embiid. Ben goes to the Nets where he just has to distribute and do a bit of playmaking to set up the superstars along with hard defense which the Nets need.
I‚Äôm gonna get downvoted to hell but the sixers are missing Ben Simmons. We were better with him and to say otherwise at this point is just anger abt the current situation messing w objectivity. It SUCKS that we are playing w this salary black hole on our roster and he should either be traded or (better IMO) adam silver should crack down and either make him play now or never again.
Fuck Ben Simmons
Oh yeah we could‚Äôve lucked out and got Ben Simmons!
You're looking at getting Aaron Gordon or Emanuel Quickly and a bad contract or two in return for Kyrie.  He's less valuable than Ben Simmons right now.
I'd eat crow and realize that even though Ben Simmons isn't perfect he makes your team a contender instead of fighting for a five seed.
Ben Simmons numbers amirite
"Yeah well I‚Äôd rather be a Minnesota fan than have to watch embiid shoot 23 free throws, Ben Simmons not there and Tobi Harris brick everything. Can‚Äôt even win when you get 100 extra free throws lol"
"This was probably one of the worst last possessions i've seen in a while. You have a 300 pound 7 footer who has 42 points, including going 16-21 in the FT line and Seth Curry, but the best shot you get is a contested three-pointer falling backwards by Embiid?  This is so laughably bad and probably the reason why Philadelphia won't do shit in the playoffs with or without Ben Simmons. Doc Rivers is just the worst, Joel Embiid thinks he is a guard in late game situations and they don't have a PG. Unreal how much talent they are wasting."

"If you are high on Ben Simmons then this wouldn't sound crazy to you, especially considering how Harden looks.   Ben has become underrated. He's one of the best floor raisers in the NBA, and Harden is on the decline.   And if you read the text, it also asks whether the Sixers would need to give more value."
"I‚Äôd like to put him there, depends how strict voting is though. Cp3 and booker are clearly your 2 guards.   I‚Äôd have him as arguably the best defensive guard this year though, especially with holiday not playing at his best, and no Ben simmons"
Ben Simmons would never
Ben Simmons would never have taken a shot like that.
Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons lmao
"I said before, I believe the Lakers would take calls on AD for Ben Simmons straight up."
leebron turned in to ben simmons because dirk was just that intimidating. its tthe german gene
"we'll give u malik beasley and taurean prince for ben simmons to help kick it off, we'll even throw in a second."
Clearly it was Ben Simmons fault  That was the turning point of the game  Cant win a regular season game with that guy as the PG
Ben Simmons 22-0 vs the Knicks and the Wolves. Sixers 0-3 against them this year lol
During the off-season I was informed by Sixers fans that we could never be competitive if we didn‚Äôt urgently trade for Ben Simmons.
Embiid is a great player but 76ers have a glaring hole at perimeter playmaker. They‚Äôre asking Embiid to do everything. It‚Äôs just wild Ben simmons is not playing because he‚Äôs butt hurt.
Ben Simmons looking at him like ‚Äúmaybe I can do this!‚Äù
his name rhymes with ben simmons
BEN SIMMONS could do this.
"honestly, im glad the sixers have never accomplished anything with this core, all of these people (players, announcers, crowd) are insufferable  starting to feel bad for ben simmons dealing with these people, i would stay home too ngl"
Yeah people forget this but Dirk wasn't nearly as good in the Finals as he was in the Western playoffs and if LeBron didn't turn into Ben Simmons his run would have ended there
Ben Simmons
"No but with all the rumors that Kyrie might retire I don't think Philly is going to waste Ben Simmons for a potential Kyrie rental, if he even chooses to play"
"Harden has been possessed by the spirit of Ben Simmons  Bro you aren't here to set up DeAndre Bembry and Cam Thomas, you literally averaged 35 PPG 2-3 years ago"
Dejounte Murray vs. Ben Simmons.
I feel a little bit disappointed with Ben Simmons.  I cant name my issue with him to be exact but I dont see him winning ROTY.
"It's more similar when you look into it more.   The 76ers really don't want Ben to take developmental minutes from Maxey and Isaiah Joe. They know Ben isn't going to work in the playoffs anyway and the more minutes they can devote to Maxey gives them flexibility for when they eventually trade Ben Simmons. If Maxey keeps improving, he can be playable late in the playoffs if the 76ers get a good wing in return for Ben.   Wall isn't a long term solution and where he ends up is going to be due more to money rather than how good he looks playing this year. Ben playing wouldn't be a long term solution for the 76ers and they would still be looking to pull the trigger on a trade ASAP if they got something they wanted. If either plays, they are both getting limited minutes. Neither really wants to play for the teams they are currently on. Both playing basketball has a real chance of lowering their own values, whether intentionally or not - either with even a minor injury for Wall or if Ben continues to regress in shooting."
I want to see Anthony Davis and Ben Simmons in the 3-point All-Star contest.
"Gotchu   Curry, Trae,Luka,Harden,Dame,Ja,Fox,Brogdon,Russ,Lamelo,Lonzo,Dejonte,Jamal Murray,Ben Simmons, DLo,Garland,Jrue,CP3,Lowry, Conley, FVV. There‚Äôs 21 guys I see clearly ahead.   Then you could also say Cole Anthony/Maxey/Schroeder/Dinwiddie"
Ben Simmons lol
BAW GAWD THAT'S BEN SIMMONS' MUSIC!
I‚Äôll give you Ben Simmons for him
Ben Simmons peaked in high school
Like Ben Simmons situation is just a mess right now. It kinda reminds me of the Cavs-Kyrie situation but the Cavs just caved in instead of trying to fix or delay the problem.
"I can see Wiggins in Ben Simmons. Look at where two-way Wigs is now. With just the effort of Porter, he could be elite in GSW."
Glorified Ben Simmons without the playmaking ability.
Dude needs to trade himself for Ben Simmons.
"Technically, a lot of the NBA dream team members hated Isaiah Thomas such as Magic, Larry, Scottie just to name a few.  It wasn't just Michael who didn't want him on the original Dream Team. But, I agree with the rest of your post with the exception of not hating Chris Paul.  Ben Simmons is a little bitch."
"Just tell them Ben Simmons would provide excellent defense in replacement of Fox, I'm sure they'll start to appreciate him a lot more."
"You‚Äôre telling me the difference between Steph Curry and Ben Simmons, is just the Steph‚Äôs built different? Lmao I agree completely, there‚Äôs clearly natural talent for shooting. Curry is a born shooter and has been training his shooting skills for most of his life now."
"Davis has more career all defensive team selections including 2 first team to embiids none. He has a higher career block AND steal average.  Both in regular season and in playoffs davis has a higher career field goal percentage by not an insignificant margin.  Embiid threw Simmons under the bus after last season helping cause this shit storm in Philly. In the media he‚Äôs continually called out Ben, you call that good leadership?  None of what you‚Äôre saying is backed by reality so I‚Äôm curious how you‚Äôre rationalizing it?"
Oh yeah teue Ben Simmons &gt; Trae Young in that case
Phylly literally have Ben Simmons depression
Here I am being Ben Simmons.
The thought is that Ben AND Embiid isn‚Äôt an option anymore but maybe AD and Simmons could still work.   So maybe just maybe Ben + AD &gt; just Embiid.
Like Ben Simmons?
Wouldn‚Äôt it be crazy if the sixers pivoted and traded embiid for Anthony Davis and kept Ben Simmons?  I know I‚Äôm gonna be downvoted to shit but honestly I‚Äôm not sold on Embiid leading a title contender. Too oft injured. I don‚Äôt even know if that would appease Simmons but just a thought. Sixers with Simmons and Davis work much better imo. I don‚Äôt see why the Lakers would be against it. But go ahead everyone tear me to pieces.
Iono man Trae young blocked a Ben Simmons dunk.
something something Ben Simmons....
How sick would it be if a Lebron traded Himself for  BEN Simmons? Build the dumpster fire then jet?  I might MIGHT like him a little more for the sense of humor.
I‚Äôve been saying lakers should just blow this whole thing up and trade Lebron for Ben Simmons
I'm a tiny bit curious what Dray could do with Ben Simmons
Trae Young blocked Mo Bamba and his rim protection lead to Ben Simmons passing instead of dunking. Gotta give this one to the point goblin
Just fuckin trade the dude already we got a slightly used Ben Simmons for trade hmu
"Ah yes, Ben Simmons, renowned for his intensity and passion and the way he leaves it all out there on the floor. His unflinching drive to win and his devotion to his team and teammates. Absolutely. Just like Dray."
My dream is to get Myles turner and Ben Simmons on the blazers. Would be incredible to see them become a defensive juggernaut plus dame.   Cj for Simmons straight up.   Covington plus filler and pick for turner.
"Lol OK sure. Try Ben simmons (!) tobias Harris, Danny Green all missing major time. Seth curry has missed games as well. We essentially played without any of last seasons starters a few nights ago (and actually won). Also missed thybulle and Joe for 2 weeks. I guess operating with only 7/8 players for half the games this season is a better situation? You must only have abojt 3 players left then"
" Ben Simmons: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the Ben Simmons. I got a shot that‚Äôs well put together that can make 10, 12, 15 free throws in a row. I can do it. I just got to want to do it. I got to commit on the three point line a little bit more for a full 48."""
Ben Simmons to the Lakers it is.
Would Ben Simmons have shot 50% from the Free Throw Line in the bubble? I really don‚Äôt think so. Bubble doesn‚Äôt make you better when everyone has the same advantages/disadvantages.
"I'm sick of no one taking me seriously and listening, so perk ya eyes up right now:  LeBron will be traded for Ben Simmons. Assets will be exchanged to make it work, but that will be the deal. Put five on it."
"Ben Simmons with league average shooting is at minimum a top 10 player to me. I‚Äôm still undecided if he has the mentality to become truly elite but I‚Äôm a big fan of his talent and if he could shoot he‚Äôd be an amazing player.  Also your call of Shaq with average FT is a good one, he‚Äôd be at minimum no.3 all time if that was the case imo."
Ben Simmons is definitely better than CJ. Just because he cannot shoot doesn‚Äôt mean he isnt better at everything else. Ben Simmons is still a top young talent in this league who is getting disrespected right now.
"So Timberwolves doesn't want to give up: KAT, Edwards or D'lo and they think they can land Simmons? Why?   Philly doesn't have any urgency to trade Simmons. He has 4 years left in his contract and if he doesn't play that is his choice, you can't get a worse return than McDaniels, beasley + picks, What does that do for Philly? having that return is not that much better than having nobody for a year. That is right, I think Philly should force Simmons to play, if he doesn't just wait until the end of the season to trade him, the packages won't get worse than what Wolves are offering.   **OR** Simmons plays, shows everybody why they should trade for him and ups his value and then he gets traded. I really don't think Philly should trade Ben for bag of chips."
The easy answer to me is Ben Simmons with a jump shot.
It‚Äôs Ben Simmons and it‚Äôs not even close
"Right now, half the posts are a Ben Simmons post. What a time to be alive."
"Ben Simmons with an average jump shot.  He would be All NBA for a long ass time.  Same with Matisse, he would be an All-Star candidate in a few years with an average jumpshot."
"Unpopular Opinions  1. For the last 7-8 ish years, Harden has been the best guard while Steph has been the most iconic.  2. Individual players should not be given the credit of team accomplishments, but for the role they play in that team's accomplishment. This is why I do not like the ""rings"" argument. 3. The NBA gets tougher with time. Players are better now than they were previously and this is a continuous process. 4. Ben Simmons is a better defender than Scottie Pippen. 5. Zion Williamson's most impressive attribute is his layup package and prowess."
I assume the hard hat is picking fun at Ben Simmons for building houses with his bricks
"If trae young was a league average defender, he would be a beast.  Also I think the obvious one is if Ben Simmons was a league average shooter, he could probably be MVP"
"Ben Simmons give him any one shooting skill (3, midrange, free throw) he‚Äôd be top 10 in today‚Äôs game easily"
Ohh interesting. These are mine  Ben simmons is so good at removing the need of help defense in this era that you can literally plug him into any team and he will be able to make you look better than you are. Embiid thybulle are products of this as defensive players.    Players from euroleague are severely underrated at the nba both on defense and offense. The defense there is fundamentally different which makes you a bigger part of a team than say the nba.   There is a possibility where the euroleague suplants the nba as the de facto best league in the world within the next 10 years. Probably not marketing wise but team wise.   Player development in north America is fundamentally flawed which forces players into very tight niches when they could've been much better with a broader approach to fundamentals
"I remember people saying he was Ben Simmons with a Jumper. I turned on his college games and thought, dog Ben Simmons had like 6 inches on this kid. Good to see I was basically right"
"you were just complaining about how ben simmons wasnt committed to getting better. so the fact that you are completely willing to ignore anthony edwards being completely unchanged during the time that hes supposed to be undergoing the most amount of mental development is pretty telling to how much youre committed to understanding the situation  and youre acting like ants decision making isnt a *weakness* when it really is. most all-nba players, even when they are 19, are not as bad as ant is. and the only reason it looked like he was a better decision maker down the stretch of the season is because of how god damn easy it is for him to capitalize on his gravity (which is why its so frustrating that he isnt better). he can make the simplest of reads and make things happen, similar to zach lavine, but the value these have is limited and until he can prove that he can do more than just swing the ball when defenses start to commit (which he hasnt really)   i know that its popular to hate on ben simmons, which is why you do, but it kills me inside whenever people try to pretend like they know so much when they absolutely do not. i know that you guys lack some pretty fundamental knowledge, but just come on, use your brains, ben simmons has made 3 consecutive all star teams and the only reason he wouldnt make another is because of the public perception of him, not that his impact is lacking. you know this and still maintain that a guy whos realisitc ceiling is as a all-star completely eclipses his value  honestly, give me an example of a person going from being an absolutely awful to good decision maker? the only one i can think of is jaylen brown, and i *know* that jaylen brown works 10x harder than anthont edwards does"
"I just don‚Äôt get why people would still prefer to build around Simmons, the idea of Simmons is much better than Ben Simmons himself. This idea that on his own team he could be a Giannis type player(albeit on a worse scale) is weird to me because he lacks aggression and is not as great of finisher as you‚Äôd think"
"Man, ben simmons boutta lead the wolves to the 13th seed"
"Charles Barkley would easily be considered as being better than Malone, if he'd shot 35% on the obscene amount of 3's he attempted  Ben Simmons - Shooting  Trae Young - Defense (Trae's doing well for himself, but the dude would be the frontrunner for both MVP and MIP, if he magically became an average defender)  Young Rondo - Shooting (he'd be seen in the same light as CP3)  Roy Hibbert - Shooting  Carmelo Anthony - Defense  Jordan Clarkson, Lou Williams and all the other microwave guards throughout NBA history - Defense  Blake Griffin, Amar'e and all the other athletic forwards that never became true superstars - Defense and/or Shooting"
"Reporter: ""Ben, Doc just lost another big lead in a playoff series, do you think he has what it takes to coach a championship winning team?""                Ben: ""I don't know the answer to that question""             Now, imagine the outcry if that was a conversation that happened....Doc wouldn't be happy either. People defending Doc are just those looking for any excuse to put another nail in the Simmons coffin."
This and Ben Simmons are going the distance.
"Brandon Ingram's best attribute is his scoring ability and I dont think Ingram is one of the best 10 scorers in the NBA.  Where as Ben Simmons is probably Top 10 in defense, playmaking &amp; athleticism."
"If Ben had/has a team built around him like Giannis, he could be just as good, if not better than Giannis. Bring the hate.  I also think if he was drafted into a typical ""tanking"" franchise, there's a very good chance he wouldn't have developed his mental block with shooting, since he wouldn't have been as concerned with making the ""winning"" play early on in his career, and maybe be a bit more selfish and work on developing his game. These ""he's soft and selfish because he doesn't work hard and hasn't gotten better"" takes are lame. On the contrary, I think he showed incredible maturity and selflessness at a young age, trying to fit in and contribute to winning basketball instead of focusing on what would be best for his career. I think a lot of his shortcomings have been magnified due to graciously accepting that Embiid is the franchise player, and not wanting to start a Kobe v Shaq dynamic.   Hindsight is 20/20 - it's obvious now that he should have focused more on his shooting. But I think he realized Embiid was always going to be the primary offensive option, and they were going to surround him with shooters. So Simmons decided to play to his strengths on offense, and focus most of his development into becoming an extremely versatile defender and a legit DPOY contender. I think it was a well-founded approach at the time. Unfortunately, while I think his initial decision agreement to defer to Embiid on offense came from a place of good intent/maturity, it turned into passiveness, and now into a complete lack of confidence. It's really been sad to watch, and see all the hate he's gotten.  Those who say he hasn't improved his game simply by looking at stats are the classic example of a typical r/NBA casual who doesn't watch or understand basketball. His defensive development has been incredible to watch. I really hope he is able to save his career. I truly think he still has the potential to be a legit top5 player in the NBA - it sucks that it's probably too late in his career for a team to truly commit to building around him. It seems as if he's always going to be considered a flawed complimentary piece."
Ben Simmons and shooting the rock
"It‚Äôs 100% depends on the type of team you currently have. Ironically, if I had some semblance of the Lakers young core, say a DLo, Randle, Clarkson, I‚Äôm taking Ben Simmons. If I have nothing, I‚Äôm taking Ingram. Ben Simmons is Draymond Green on Fucking hulk steroids. If you put draymonds skill set into lebrons body and then game him an extra 3 inches, that‚Äôs Ben Simmons."
Seems topical to mention Ben Simmons with an average jumper or free throw shooting.
I misread the quote...I thought Shaq said he'd eat Ben Simmons' ass out...
Ben Simmons would be value higher if he shoots
Try to find one Ben Simmons shot that isn't indirect
Is this just a rogue Ben Simmons post?
Healthy nuggets are the best team in the west  You‚Äôll never win a title with Dame as your #1  Ben Simmons will play great once he‚Äôs out of that negative environment
Ben Simmons -&gt; 3pt shot
"The Queens- Unless Fox takes a big leap this year, I don‚Äôt see them going anywhere.   The Timberpups- disappointed that they have that much talent (KAT, DLo, Edwards) but the highest they can do is a first round exit as currently constructed.   Sixers - Even if they do a Ben Simmons trade, the best they can be is a perennial 2nd rd exit. Tobias Harris is straight up untrade-able unless Philly is willing to bite the bullet on that one as well.   I also agree with your picks, OP."
"I mean Embiid isn‚Äôt Kareem but he‚Äôs an MVP caliber center, so that‚Äôs just a bad take IMO. A way better take would be that Ben Simmons is magic Johnson in the three point shooting era. It‚Äôs still wrong but at least the qualifier is more accurate"
"Even if they are good friends,  why would Rosas want to start a bidding war for Ben Simmons? His job is to get Simmons onto the Wolves for as cheaply as possible."
"Caruso wasn't the starting PG and was on a rookie contract. Mario Chalmers was on a team friendly contract (but did start). If Ben Simmons was a backup PG making similar money to Caruso, he could be on a championship team, maybe."
"I really have to disagree - and I guess it's more to do with the term ""champion level PG"" than your comment in particular. The starting PGs since 2010 of NBA Champions are:  * Jrue Holiday * Alex Caruso * Kyle Lowry * Steph Curry (x2) * Kyrie Irving * Tony Parker * Mario Chalmers (x2) * Derek Fisher * Jason Kidd   This list goes to show ""champion level PGs"" vary wildly. Also shows that if Ben Simmons had a jumpshot and replaced the PGs in the list, he would've been an NBA Champion more often than not."
"Kidd / Marbury was kind of like if you traded... maybe Ben Simmons for Brandon Ingram last year (before Simmons's perception tanked)? Or Collin Sexton with a much higher profile on a marginally better team.   Kidd had gotten way farther in fixing his garbage jumper by then than Simmons has, and he'd been The Man on some good teams, but he was still an extremely unusual star player who hadn't gone deep into the playoffs yet (and the domestic violence case was very much on the Suns' brass's minds). Marbury had put up big numbers and was definitely a star in terms of his public profile, and he was meaningfully younger, but his teams hadn't done anything yet.   If you think about Simmons for Sexton, you can see the outlines of the version the team getting Marbury wins‚ÄîSimmons is just too weird to build a team around and we've already seen him at his best, Sexton thrives on a good team‚Äîand you can see what actually happened if you're able to imagine Ben Simmons hitting threes sometimes and having a full personality transplant."
Ben Simmons with league average free throw percentage lmao
"Except he is a threat to shoot. He‚Äôs not a 3pt shooter but Markelle does have a mid range shot and a pull-up game that he can and has shown the ability to easily get to. At this point it‚Äôs just a matter of getting reps and consistency to raise his %‚Äôs from there. His last healthy season in 2019-2020 nearly 50% of Markelle‚Äôs shots came from floater range to the deep mid range. He shot ~42% from floater range, shot 49% from deep 2 and 40% from 10-14 feet. On top of that on NON pull up 3-pt attempts he shot 45%. He doesn‚Äôt have to work hard to get to his spots he gets there pretty easily on the contrary due to his ball control and ability to change pace whether it be off a standstill, on the move, in transition or off a pick.    &gt;theres a reason why he barely scores and on such bad efficiency.  His last fully healthy season he averaged ~12ppg which is slightly higher than league average. He wasn‚Äôt averaging more simply because he can‚Äôt score it‚Äôs due to his FGA ( Orlando has FOUR other players averaging 12+ FGA/g) and his lack of 3pt and FTr which I mentioned before. Markelle Futlz can score. His efficiency isn‚Äôt bad, the advanced efficiency stats where the 3pt shot is heavily skewed in favor of is where his stats look bad. He‚Äôs a great finisher at the rim and can get there at ease, serviceable in the floater range and a good pull up shooter, if he took the DeMar DeRozan or Ben Simmons route and ONLY shot in spots where he felt comfortable he‚Äôd be posting splits of like 51/0/73 on like 58 TS%.   &gt;The change of pace style he plays with only works if you‚Äôre a threat to pull up, and he just isn‚Äôt.  That‚Äôs the thing, he is a threat to do that and there‚Äôs numbers and tracking data to back it up."
 Ben Simmons with a jumpshot the only correct answer
Ben Simmons doesn‚Äôt belong in the NBA
Simmons was never choking KAT like all these morons were saying lmao. Ben and KAT have been good friends for a long time. He was just laying on top of him.
"Motor. I think having a high motor can get you somewhere. Always willing to grind is big. I mean. Look at dejuan Blair. Dude literally played with no acls his whole nba career, but kept playing with motor. This is what Ben Simmons is missing."
"While I absolutely hate Rich Paul for how he treats his less tier clients primarily Nerlens Noel.   I honestly don't have any issues with players trying to force trades to the teams they want to go to.   Like Sports teams don't have any sense of loyalty. It's hey what can you do for me now if you can't do anything for me the good bye.   While Charles Barkley complains about Ben Simmons and Anthony Davis, look at what the Kings did with DeMarcus Cousins. Look at what Clippers did Blake Griffin. Look at Boston did with Isaiah Thomas.   Isaiah Thomas was headed towards getting at least $15-25 mil per contract with how well he was doing in Boston. And his teammates liked him too. Then Danny Ainge cold heartedly shipped him off to Cleveland and dude didn't help with Cleveland and lost out on a big extension.   So yeah I don't really mind players forcing their way to their chosen team if they have the ability too."
Ben Simmons
ben simmons do i need to say more
"As a Cavs fan who has watched him closely there are two sides to this.  He is not working his body out anymore.  He just... stopped...  If he were on a better team he MIGHT feel inclined to try again, but he also has some similar mental blocks to Ben Simmons.  It's not just that the Cavs have been bad, but he doesnt love the game like he used to.  On the other hand, if he WANTS to, he can still get 20 a night with his 3 point shooting.  He has an under rated IQ, and could definitely contribute to a contender.  His calf is not as bad as he implies."
Ben Simmons and Giannis with an average shot
"With the magnitude that we are talking about here I would rather have Dennis Shr√∂der on my team tbh. Ben Simmons is really underdeveloped and if you honestly think he is a good of a player as Shr√∂der right now youve got another thing coming.  Ben Simmons, even if he learns how to shoot, is so underdeveloped at anything but passing that his impact is capped super low on any team looking to compete same way that Brandon Knight is, but more so.  Ben Simmons is still struggling with the same issues he has for years and considering how vocally disinterested he is in basketball, i don't really understand why you are so certain taking a veteran minimum player wouldn't better overall for the Sixer."
What does that have to do with Ben Simmons
- Westbrook and three point shooting  - Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and shooting  - Enes Kanter and defense  Ben Simmons has to be the biggest one though. If he just up and became a 35% three point shooter with an average midrange he could average 23/8/8. He is already an All-Star but he would turn into a perennial All-NBA player.
"Ben Simmons is a superstar on almost any other team.  Philadelphia's culture is just negative.  (Sorry)  Also...  Wilt Chamberlin doesnt count as an all time great because he played so long ago that he may as well have played a different sport.  There was no 3 point line.  The game was all layups.  There were no goaltending rules.  There were no 5 second rules.  And he was basically the only big dude in the league for years - at least the only one that wasnt just dumb muscle.  In fact, if Wilt played today, he would be a G leaguer.  I'm sorry, everyone.  That's just how I feel about it.  Ok.  I am ready for the hate."
That's every post. Try to find one post that isn't an indirect shot at Ben Simmons.
I thought this whole post was an indirect Ben Simmons post.
I'm almost certain Ben Simmons will have a career year if he has a new team. He plays best when he's been embarrassed and has something to prove and this whole off-season it's just been stewing.
Ben Simmons with a scorer mindset
"Spurs will land Simmons, turn it around after tanking initially and getting Tim and Tony 2.0.  Ben will turn out to be the new Manu changing entirely and giving 80 years old Pop mino heart attacks."
Ben simmons is magic johnson without kareem
LOL. Everything is a leak. None of this is real. Ben Simmons is actually perfectly happy where he's at and ready to start a new season!
"From what we heard from Morey, I think SexLand would be the *starting* price for just Ben Simmons. If you want Simmons and Seth, idk, you could trade Baker to the Eagles and ship in 2016 ring. Oh, also a 1st."
Ben Simmons is still a generational talent
Ben Simmons' value was already low a year ago and he's still overvalued.
"I want them to have him play for half a season. Apologize to him, coddle him, whatever it takes. Fuck pride. It's about winning. And this team is not going to be better without Ben Simmons."
Breaking News: Ben Simmons has a piss-poor attitude.
Russell Westbrook has become the most over rated player in the league  Ben Simmons has become the most under rated  All over the course of this offseason
"I don‚Äôt get how simmons fans can blame Doc. And that‚Äôs coming from a laker fan.  I mean, yeah the dude is getting more mileage out of a single championship than any other coach has. His rotations are crap. But the one thing doc does(and to a detrimental extent more times than not.) is stick up to his stars and cater to them. didn‚Äôt doc fight for ben? Even to the point of calling out reporters and saying that they don‚Äôt know basketball because they asked that he should bench ben in the 4th?  It was only until Ben repeatedly failed to come up big in the 4th quarter AND finally refuse to dunk over trae young was when doc said ‚Äúenough of this shit‚Äù.  I mean, yeah ben is a great player, but the things that people have said he should improve on in his first year in the league are still there. every year that he‚Äôs in the playoffs people sag off of him that makes it harder for him to score and initiate the offence. And the sixers have done all they can to accomodate him cause he can literally be Generational if he gets to his potential. Heck reporters even criticize Embiid cause he plays in the perimeter too often rather than dominate in the paint where he‚Äôs best at. Can you guess why he does that?"
Based on what? AD would have won more championships in Boston or on the Knicks? Is what he is doing for Ben Simmons what is best for Lebron? Was getting KCP way overpaid by the Lakers good for Lebron? I think you are conflating the issue.
Ur getting downvotes but just because Ben Simmons had a bad series doesn‚Äôt somehow make him worse than sexton.
All this off-season has done is make me dislike Ben Simmons and Daryl Morrey even more. They both refuse to accept their actual values and it‚Äôs so frustrating to watch
"You might be underestimating how much Simmons could potentially improve your offense as well. Obviously he doesn‚Äôt give you shooting, but he is an absolute beast in transition and his bball iq is very high. He posts great assist to turnover ratios and is a great distributor. Sixers were an excellent regular season team in no small part thanks to Ben and the wolves could add a bunch of wins with him as a point forward type. He also gives you some interesting lineup choices."
"Game 7 of the NBA Finals, 4 minutes to go 4th quarter. Who do you want on the floor? Ben Simmons or Seth Curry."
"Ben Simmons will be a top 10 player at some point, after he is traded."
He may have been shitting on Ben but that was at the end of a historically dreadful series where Simmons flat out embarrassed himself. Maybe he should just shut his mouth and go to work to make sure he doesn‚Äôt embarrass himself again like that.
&gt;He believes that the Timberwolves are the team that wants Ben Simmons the most in the NBA but also that the market for Simmons is very dry and that there isn't a bidding war for Simmons that Morey hoped there would be.  Hard to have a bidding war when you make outrageous demands.  Who wants this lightly used Kia? I won't accept less than...1 million dollars!!!
It does for guys who 1) are still on their rookie deal or 2) not of the quality of Kyrie or PG. Garland is on his rookie deal and Ben Simmons isn‚Äôt a superstar.
"No, and it's not even really necessarily about them believing in RJ.  The Knicks are asset stacking and gearing up for a big swing in free agency or on the trade market, and I couldn't see them giving up their most valuable young player and picks for Ben Simmons with those bigger goals in mind.  Because then you have way less to give up when a Dame or a Zion hits the market, and that's who they're really aiming for."
Ben Simmons chose to never elevate his game or develop balls. He‚Äôs leveled off &amp; may have reached his ceiling. Zero killer mentality w/ no jumper.
"You need to read the context of the question better. I don't want to converse anymore than that.  In my own opinion, I don't think Ben Simmons is capable of being ""the"" point guard for a championship team."
"Ben Simmons is just screwing himself.   Also, we can get all creative in trading him and getting equal or better value but I can't seem to find a place for him where his 5 ft shooting range can work, unless you play him Center."
Have all the 76ers fans apologize and promise to be more understanding.  Have Ben Simmons to agree to at least try to work in the half court  ü´Ç ü§ó üèÜ ‚úå
*sees army of Trae Youngs*  *Ben Simmons requests a trade from Mongolia*
"Ben Simmons is a below average offensive point guard, who‚Äôs paid like a max player and has a superstar reputation. A bad attitude, zero work ethic and is an extremely high risk investment.   He‚Äôs not worth close to that the Sixers want in return. All defense is heavily overrated and hasn‚Äôt helped his teams get passed the second round. You can barely justify having him in the court in the 4th quarter."
"He was instrumental in the Raptors winning games in the playoffs. As the 6th man, like you say.  Taking a look at Simmons' numbers... he really has regressed in the playoffs. Numbers arent so bad, but he keeps taking less and less shots. Something happened to his FT game.  I like FVV, I'm a homer. I think he plays to win and he isnt afraid. He's made for big moments, but he'll never be an all star.   Ben Simmons is afraid to take shots in the playoffs. I dont even know what happened to this guy. He's a number 2 guy next to Embiid, but maybe he's more of a 3 or even 4 option.  If I'm the 76ers, right now, I'd rather have the guy that isnt afraid to take shots. With a legitimate point guard they beat the Hawks last year, then they compete w the Bucks. This year, if they grab a new PG, they will be competitors again because Embiid is simply that good.  Cant have guys w the yips being 2 options"
Imagine Ben Simmons playing for Mourinho or SAF. He would be traded after his rookie contract.
just curious my Twin Cities friend...do you even want Ben Simmons after the nightmare that happened in Game 7?
"Simmons is perfectly free to fire Rich Paul at any point, how exactly does that work out into the whole ""Rich Paul is Ben Simmons' boss"" equation?"
Ben Simmons. Do i need to explain?
"&gt;why would the sixers want to keep tobias over ben?  Because if you trade Simmons you'll get more in return  &gt;the problem they face is the fit with ben and jo but what i‚Äôm saying is that can be fixed with a ball handler that can shoot and pass in the halfcourt  If they had a ball handler in the halfcourt it would help their offence. But Simmons would still have to play around the rim, a ball handler isn't going to stop Ben having to stand in the short corner. When Butler was on the team he still played that way, and that way is still a bad fit with Embiid   Also, who is this ball handler? Who are they going to add that will be the 76ers playoff guard creator? Adding this player will also make Simmons offence even more redundant"
Ben Simmons. I keep seeing things like he belongs in the NBA. The guy is cba quality talent. I‚Äôm sorry the man shouldn‚Äôt be in this league.
Ben Simmons is still fun to watch. He hustles hard on defense and his playmaking is a joy to watch. I‚Äôd rather watch him over a bunch of players just chucking 3s.
"with the magnitude that were talking about? its so much fucking polish lmao. hes really underdeveloped and if you honestly think that him being as good of a player as simmons is right now is a sure thing youve got another thing coming  anthony edwards, even if he starts to actually start making his shots on anywhere even close to a consistent basis, is still so undeveloped as a decision maker that his impact is capped super low on any team looking to compete in exactly the same way as in zach lavine is, but more so  anthony edwards is still struggling with the same issues he has been for years, and considering how vocally disinterested he is in basketball, i dont really understand why you guys are so certain that hes going to be better than ben simmons"
I wish 76er fans were the gm so Chicago could get Ben Simmons for absolutely nothing
"Atp Simmons has probably surpassed both on perimeter defense + like and them 2 are the same size range, trae is like 8-9 inches shorter then ben"
Ben Simmons is not nearly interesting enough to garner as much attention as he does and it speaks to the larger problem the NBA is facing: off court drama &gt;&gt;&gt; on court product
10 seed legend Ben Simmons
"&gt;he is very good at getting to the rim and finishing  The problem is that it's the only place he can finish, and he doesn't have a lot of diversity to his finishing  &gt;when embiid and tobias aren‚Äôt taking up that space  That's the point. Embiid and Tobias are better scorers and can create in a range of ways, but because Simmons can only score in a single way they have to do something different. He forces them, and the offence, away from what they are good at and a lot of efficient scoring   &gt;if you replaced tobias for cj i think it would benefit ben and joel  That's true to a degree. Simmons would have the ball even less in the halfcourt, and CJ creates more of his shots from the perimeter than Tobias. But Ben and Joel are still an awful fit. In the halfcourt Simmons is basically an unskilled 5 with passing ability, Joel is an incredibly talented 5. Simmons makes it easier to double Joel, while providing very little  &gt;the fit for those 3 is awkward and that‚Äôs my problem  There's 1 player making that fit awkward, the player that's only effective if he's standing in front of the rim. Embiid is one of the best players in the world, you do everything you can to put him in a position to generate effective offence. Tobias is a versatile shooting forward, he's not talented enough to be a reason to define the shape of your team, but he's not that difficult to fit around. Replace Simmons with CJ and the fit also gets a lot better"
"Because it's been shown to us, time and again, Ben won't improve if he's being coddled. Sure, did this approach backfire? Likely. But a different approach to handling Simmons needed to be made because none have clearly worked so far."
No. The fault was the Sixers front office who gave the money to Ben Simmons rather than Jimmy Butler.
"""Simmons, as good as he is, cant guard that many offensive weapons on his own.""  Ting ting ting, you see the problem !  When you are paying that much for Ben Simmons, who is average in the halfcourt, you don't get value out of a player who can only defend *one* guy at a time.  An elite help defender - Giannis for example - can frustrate an entire offensive structure, as can an elite rim defender.  But a one on one defender ? Not so much.  On $15m a year, Simmons would absolutely be part of a championship winning team.  But on a max ? Mediocrity city, baby !"
"I feel like the Bulls should be considered a rebuild because 3/5 of their starters were acquired in the last year? And they replaced their coach - this seems like a rebuild to me.   Grizzlies are the definition of a rebuild - got rid of their two franchise players Marc Gasol and Mike Conley in 2019, and have drafted a solid young core which was the 9th seed in 2020 and the 8th seed in 2021. If you get rid of your franchise players and start building around a young star that is the definition of a rebuild - and they‚Äôve had more success than the Cavs in a harder conference.   Thanks for agreeing on the Wolves. Their core has only played like 10 games with the 3 of them.   I look forward to seeing what the Cavs can do, but feel like you have a lot of issues still? Coach got replaced, Love is still useless/looking to get bought out, Jarrett Allen is paid 100m over 5 but your high potential draft pick plays the same position? And Garland and Sexton also kind of do? I think you have nice pieces to trade, your team just needs to make some tough decisions. Ben Simmons would be good on your team tho."
"Every time I see Ben Simmons linked to the Wolves I immediately think about that game where Ben, Embiid, and KAT had a flat out brawl on the hardwood. How do they expect an immature ass player like Simmons to bury the hatchet with KAT?"
"Wasn‚Äôt expecting a Ben Simmons vs Jordan Clarkson 1v1 but I‚Äôll take it.  GG Jazz bros, fun game"
How did the Jazz have 9 more FTs when shooting 20 more 3s? Why don‚Äôt the same protections you get as a shooter apply to people at the rim? The same contact on Jordan Clarkson shooting a 3 is a foul but not on Ben Simmons in the paint. It‚Äôs insane
Ben Simmons good. Utah Jazz good.  Sixers bench bad. Utah commentators bad
Crazy thing is Ben Simmons could do this every game but something is stopping him.
"Oh, so that's why you posted what you posted earlier.  It has nothing to do with playing the best team in the NBA. No, it's because Ben Simmons doesn't shoot 3s.  Foh"
Ben Simmons doing all of this without a jumper. Unbelievable
Ben Simmons for Clarkson straight up? Jazz hang up the phone before Daryl even finishes the sentence.
Gobert wanted to put Ben Simmons back in the Louvre.
Should have put Ben Simmons to restart rookie of the year debate
Only Ben Simmons could have his best game and then start to wane in crunch time
ben simmons is throwing right handed hooks from jump shot range... KOC is  somewhere taking notes
"This game is convincing me that the Jazz aren't legit. They can't guard any one of the big stars, even freaking Ben Simmons."
Ben Simmons having the game of his life but Sixers are losing.
If only Giannis has any post move like Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons masterclass
Why does Ben Simmons have 42 against the Jazz
"Ben Simmons vs Donovan Mitchell, sad that rivalry died down"
I hereby declare that I will no longer slander Ben Simmons ever again.
Ben Simmons literally hadnt scored more than 23 pts in a game all season before tonight lmao
"Okay, when did Ben Simmons become a good FT shooter?"
Ben ‚ÄúKareem Abdul Jabbar‚Äù Simmons
Ben Simmons is gonna drop 40+ in a loss üò≥
BEN SIMMONS HATERS EAT MY CO K
What is Ben Simmons‚Äô career high??
Ben Simmons turned into a pumpkin
"Ha! If you look at the oldest comments, this thread is super civil until some Jazz fan takes a shot at Ben Simmons RotY, then it just becomes a toxic slugfest! It‚Äôs true, y‚Äôknow, that you match the energy thrown your way."
If Ben Simmons has 19 points in the first quarter and goes on to finish the game with 24 points or something like that so help me god
"How about opposing team‚Äôs fans? I think the 76ers are a great team, Ben Simmons is dominating, Embiid is MVP worthy, and I also feel really blessed to be watching this matchup."
They complaining about the refs... Ben Simmons... anything and everything other than realizing they would be in 5th place in the west
"I remember in pre season he would try being a point forward and I got sick of it. I made a comment along the lines of Randle thinks He's Ben Simmons, He must have heard me and the other Knicks fans criticisms and he has improved so much as a player. I'm so happy for him"
"He basically just needs to become Ben Simmons.  People like to shit on him, but he gets his teammates some amazing looks.    Russ has the added benefit of actually being a threat from the outside if needed.  He just needs to keep attacking &amp; dishing out like those regular season Rocket days"
i'm about to tune in and watch a 0-0 2pts vintage ben simmons 2nd half
What?  Someone linked a press conference in which Mitchell said Ben Simmons wasn't a rookie?
"I never had any emotional investment in that RoY award. Ben Simmons is a great player, and was definitely a rookie.  Just saying: Hey I think it's weird the 76ers announcers are literally telling lies about Donovan Mitchell  *shrug*  If that sounds like outrage to you, I dunno.  Quit your job, move to a Q commune? You're ready to believe anything."
Ben Simmons put 19 on you in the 1st quarter. He doesn't even like playing basketball.
Don't let Ben Simmons 19 pts distract you from Tobias Harris with 14 pts already
If I were Ben Simmons I would simply just score every time I have the ball like he just did for a quarter and then Id never have to worry about shooting a jumper.
Exactly. Ben Simmons has the quarter of his lifetime. Snyder will make sure we shore up our defense and Simmons won‚Äôt keep that up forever. Only 7 points down after that quarter? We are just fine.
Ben Simmons is 24
Nice to see Ben Simmons shutting up his haters
Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris have a combined 33 pts on 75% shooting in the first quarter üëÄ
Ben Simmons hates the Jazz confirmed
Ben simmons haters besides themselves
Is Ben Simmons the best scorer in the league?
Ben Simmons as a first option is interesting
No fucking way this is the Ben Simmons from this season
Ben Simmons is playing like a man possessed.   Donovan Mitchell awoke the beast.
has Ben Simmons ever scored 17 in a quarter before?
That‚Äôs why he purposely sat out games against Jokic and now Gobert after multiple games of playing in between?  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/nba/76ers/.amp/news/why-ben-simmons-joel-embiid-miss-sixers-vs-nuggets
Ben Simmons ain't Lebron... Lebron ain't 22 anymore... Hit me up if Simmons scores above his average in the second half.
This is the Ben Simmons rockets fans wanted
"I was ready to trade Ben Simmons for a hoagie two months ago, so this is great to see"
Ben Simmons already tied his season average lol
Ben Simmons 6/6 with 15 points? Don‚Äôt they know he can‚Äôt shoot 3s?
Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons has games like twice a week where he'll come out with a quick early 8(or now 10 points) and then go the next 2 quarters taking one shot
Aggressive Ben Simmons is a treat to watch
"Is Ben Simmons the best player in the NBA? I really can‚Äôt say, but yes."
Ben Simmons has gained enough XP to purchase a 3 pt shot
[uhh](https://www.nba.com/news/donovan-mitchell-trolls-ben-simmons-simmons-pre-game-rookie-hoodie)
Ben Simmons going for 100 (after scoring 96 in the first half)
Oh we‚Äôre getting the 16 points in first quarter then end up with 18 points the whole game Ben Simmons?
Ben Simmons ain‚Äôt playing around this game üò≥
Ben Simmons fucked a bunch of Utah moms a couple of years ago so he's got a bunch of salty illegitimate children with Jazz flairs.
"lmao this is the same excuse he used to dodge jokic  https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/basketball/news/76ers-joel-embiid-out-due-to-back-tightness/  and before you sixers flairs start lying about him being out for ""covid protocols"" (LMAO)  &gt; Superstars Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons have both been listed as out for Saturday afternoon's contest with the Denver Nuggets as the teams get set to take the floor. Their reasoning for being out has nothing to do with COVID. ‚ÄúYeah, but it has nothing to do with it, they're just not playing,‚Äù said coach Doc Rivers."
Ben Simmons has been ROTY every year he's been in the league. Show some respect.
We got Ben Simmons starting at center against Rudy Gobert. God help us
"I mean Ben Simmons was on an exceptionally bad team for a college star. Still though his best teammate averaged better numbers in the g league than he did in college, and Antonio Blakeney would enter the g league the next year and average 32 ppg."
"The same Ben Simmons that couldn't even get his LSU team to March Madness? That's a guy who had insane size at the point guard position and was a borderline all-star from his (eventual) rookie year, and he couldn't get a team of Power 5 players to qualify for a 68 team tournament. G league teams would've ate him, and any other college team, up."
But Ben Simmons will have the last laugh as he is given the Rookie of the Year award
Where is Ben Simmons
"Nothing new that teams are playing small ball and PF‚Äôs are now on the perimeter shooting threes.  In the late 80s and early 90s, some teams would have 6 or 7 guys over 6‚Äô10. Now you might see teams with 2 or 3 guys that talk.  Makes sense that Point Guards are taller. With the exception of magic- point guarded used to be under 6‚Äô3 - Stockton, Thomas, BJ Armstrong, starks, etc etc. now you have Ben Simmons and Luka playing point. The centers are now short and the Point Guards are tall."
Elfrid is just short Ben Simmons why does philly want him
"Zion, Probably Ben Simmons if he doesn't get hurt.  Plus there are also college teams that had multiple players that were atleast very solid contributors in the NBA. The 2017 Kentucky Wildcats had Bam, De'aron Fox, Malik Monk, and a few other guys that have bounced around in the G-league. You really think they'd lose to the worst team in the G-league?"
"&gt; In those shoot arounds Ben Simmons looks like STeph Curry so they aren't exactly easily translatable to in game 3's.  I look like Ben Simmons in shootaround 3's practice.  Ben Simmons looks like Curry in shootaround 3's practice.  [Curry looks like a goddamned hacker in shootaround 3's practice.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mi-lCTCvrE)  It doesn't translate 100%, but the correlation is there."
This will improve Ben Simmons' chances tho.
"lmao  &gt; Superstars Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons have both been listed as out for Saturday afternoon's contest with the Denver Nuggets as the teams get set to take the floor. Their reasoning for being out has nothing to do with COVID. ‚ÄúYeah, but it has nothing to do with it, they're just not playing,‚Äù said coach Doc Rivers."

I'm sure he does them bc everyone does them. But he doesn't ever get in game practice doing it. If the Mavs ever manage to get a second reliable playmaker I'm sure we'll see those # improve.   In those shoot arounds Ben Simmons looks like STeph Curry so they aren't exactly easily translatable to in game 3's.
"lmao, imagine making up lies so your idol doesn't look like charmin  &gt; Superstars Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons have both been listed as out for Saturday afternoon's contest with the Denver Nuggets as the teams get set to take the floor. Their reasoning for being out has nothing to do with COVID. ‚ÄúYeah, but it has nothing to do with it, they're just not playing,‚Äù said coach Doc Rivers."
"It does though. If a team feels like you can hurt them from deep then they will have to guard you there. If you're Westbrook, Ben Simmons, or Giannis teams can lay way off and it hurts spacing."
"But Ben Simmons, Shake?"
"&gt; between Simmons and Booker  Speaking of, Booker really did Ben dirty by stealing his ex and dropping 36 on his head the other night"
"Ben Simmons' agent literally told him he was being traded. Fertitta is the one who made that trade not happen, not Morey"
"But 14 points Ben Simmons makes it. Not saying that Randle should take his spot, but there's at least a decent argument."
"&gt; I'm done with this conversation because you clearly are only interested in criticizing giannis for personal reasons or something?  You're right. He fucked my dog last week. I hate him. Greek motherfucker. It isn't just that he has problems in his game. Any critique of any player scoring north of 25 points (again 21 points against competent wall defense but whatever) must be personal. When people say Ben Simmons needs a 3 point shot it's because they secretly hate him for breaking up with a Kardashian huh?  &gt;Floor Spacing, cutting, screens, all of that help.  Cut to where exactly? Defenders are in the paint. You need to place players on the 3 point line to stretch the defense as much as possible there (which they already did). Floor spacing was fine (2nd best 3 point shooting team in the league). Bucks trading for Derozan would probably be smart, good mid range shooter for Giannis pick and rolls, but I don't think that instantly solves the Bucks problems."
"&gt;Do you watch basketball?   Yeah coach it actually. BTW he scored 21 points against Miami and the Raptors. Again tho I'm not seeing something you're suggesting that will prevent wall defense. Your plan comes down to ""other guys to make shots"" which isn't a coaching thing. Giannis needs a second dimension to his game and he'll have a shot at top 10 all time. Until he does that it really isn't that complicated to game plan for him. Again easy way to break the wall is to develop a post game or mid range shot. This sub will shit on Ben Simmons for much less."
"Ben Simmons is the perfect player to out the casuals....ladies and gents, we have found one"
"Ben Simmons is 6'11"" Rondo"
We found him! We found Ben Simmons' reddit account!
"I agree with you, but if something crazy happens in Philly and they offered Ben Simmons to us for CJ plus picks I'd make that trade so fast..."
The Ben Simmons special
Yea cuz Kyrie and harden are playing a lot better than Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons
I feel like Ben Simmons can be
"fuck this, going modern day  Marcus Smart Jrue, I guess. Either him or Pat Bevy Ben Simmons or RoCo Dray (underrated as all hell) Gobert or Bam"
When was Ben Simmons traded to Detroit?
Ben Simmons He‚Äôs not as good against 5s (holds his own) but is just as good if not better than the ones you‚Äôve listed at guarding 1-4s
No they would not be because Ben Simmons without the basketball is useless he cannot shoot so his only advantage is bringing the ball up and charging to the front of the rim
Exactly. I'm here for the highlights and to shit on Ben Simmons
"Who? Like Ben Simmons? Mike Conley? Even Chris Paul? Those guys are all scoring similarly to Lonzo. Conley and paul a bit better (though Lonzo has a better eFG% than Paul), but those guys and long time vets.  Anyway, I don't know how you can watch lonzo and think it makes sense to not have him distributing the ball."
I fully believe like 6 years from now Ben Simmons will randomly out of nowhere become a serviceable shooter. It will probably happen after he's declined in his other areas of his game too just as a tease.
Ben Simmons isn't a good shooter??
Ben Simmons is sponsored by FaZe I think
"I‚Äôm still shocked at how players like Ben Simmons can make it into the world‚Äôs top basketball league without having a reliable shot, or even a jump shot at all. Not to mention being the first overall draft pick."
"Ben Simmons is a career 59% free throw shooter and a career 28% mid range shooter.  There is virtually no historical precedent for a player with those kind of efficiency ever becoming a serviceable shooter. The extreme few who have had a few seasons of good shooting are just that, extreme outliers out of the hundreds who failed at that."
"Draymond is a more willing shooter than Ben Simmons, but also a less willing shooter than Dwight Howard"
A Ben Simmons 3 with 14 seconds left on the shot clock absolutely not a good ahot.
"You didnt think Antifa and those BLM rioters weren't VIOLENT and EXTEREME? This is what a dumbass hypocrite sounds like. Yeah, robbing, arson, setting private businesses on fire and hurting citizens arent violent. IQ is as high as Ben Simmons jump shooting percentages."
ben simmons a negative asset??????
"My opinion could very well being wrong, I just don‚Äôt see it working in tight half court games in the post season (I‚Äôll admit a lot of that has to do with my opinion on Ben Simmons). It would not be the first time I was wrong."
"Ah yes, the bi-weekly shit on Ben Simmons thread."
You can‚Äôt be a superstar and a role player. I‚Äôm not that emotionally invested to really care about accuracy. Draymond Green is a really good player. I am not downing him. Simmons is simply a superior player. I would rather have a team of five Ben Simmons‚Äô than a team of 5 Draymond Greens.
"They can get away with it how? There‚Äôs literally no difference in how Ben Simmons is guarded if he shoots 0 3s a game, or shoots a few at a 25% clip"
Call me Ben Richard Simmons
Ben Simmons can get really fast at top speed but he‚Äôs not that explosive which makes him hard to get volume buckets driving in the half court.   Maybe he should take the ball all the way back to the half court line when he wants to penetrate.
well there‚Äôs truth in what he‚Äôs saying though   if Rockets could get;  Wiseman+pick(s) or Murray or Jaylen you tell me if you still take Ben Simmons
"Lol, Embiid shot 50% on the game and had 3 of the 5 dimes as the center while Simmons shot 30% with 2 dimes as the PG.  Offensively, Ben was the only sognificant guy who really played like ass on offense so why include Embiid in that equation."
Why is Embiid lumped in with Ben here? Embiid shot 50%. It‚Äôs fucking Ben Simmons bricking 7 layups a game that‚Äôs bringing that percentage down
Oubre is better than this dude. I'd trade for him over Ben Simmons
https://180coaching.org/shooting/ben-simmons-shooting-mechanics/  no 59% free throw shooter will ever be considered having a good form. That's the same free throw percentage as javale mcgee.
because ben simmons is a bum why would the rockets want him
I have Joel Embid and Ben Simmons in my fantasy team. Those 10 to really hurt my team lol.
I said ‚Äúmight‚Äù but Ben Simmons looks like he has reached his peak as a poor mans Draymond Green
"he was so passive, just standing around flat-footed on both ends of the floor for long stretches.  In theory I understand that Ben Simmons is good, but man I just don't see it.  Like, has he added anything to his game since he came into the NBA?  He seems like the exact same player he was as a rookie, which is a good player for sure but man there are still massive holes in his game."
Ben ‚ÄúUntouchable in a Harden Trade‚Äù Simmons
Ben Simmons tanking his value so he doesn't get traded. 4D chess right here
"It's just like when Philly fans try to say Ben Simmons could be a #1 option and a superstar because of a 16 game streak back in 2018 when they played against literally only 3 playoff teams, one of which was an 8th seed and another was the very last game of the season where starters barely played."
Nice game from the Nets but really didn't appreciate Jarrett Allen's cheap shot on Ben Simmons there coming around the screen.
"&gt; Personally I think that Simmons can be almost Giannis, or what Westbrook was for that two month stretch on the Rockets.   Personally, I think you're on crack. If Ben was gonna be some dominant volume scorer by driving to the paint ala Giannis or Westbrook, he'd already show he could do that."
Ben Simmons stinks
Ben Simmons can't shoot
Ben Simmons can't shoot
"You overestimate basketball's national influence big-time if you think Kyrie had household name recognition prior to 2016. My parents and people I know who don't know basketball don't know guys like John Wall, Ben Simmons, Embiid, who were on that Kyrie pre-2016 finals level fame."
Sixers losing minutes when Ben Simmons plays the 5? Shocker
look up their percentages and i promise they aren‚Äôt as bad as Simmons  Ben-for his career-is 28% from 10-16ft and 26% from 16ft-3pt
trading ben simmons and picks for james harden is the most obvious decision in the world if you have any desire to win playoff games. my only guess is philly has invested a lot of money into a ben simmons theme park and it's too late to back out now.
Ben Simmons is a unique blend of amazing and annoying that i can't seem to figure out. It jumps back and forth at such a frantic pace even during the the same possession.
"Yes they were, and even the worst among them were way better than Ben Simmons is right now in free throw and midrange shooting."
Interesting fast-break technique by Ben Simmons. Man this game is entertaining in the 3rd quarter. A real shootout.
every single one of those players were solid free throw and midrange shooters coming into the league and in their early years. they could all shoot. even the worse free throw percentage out of all of them like Kidd and Ibaka were way higher than Ben Simmons' free throw percentage. Not to mention they had way better shot mechanics.
"Yeah, he's just way too streaky a shooter. Goes from looking like Steph to Ben Simmons shooting 3s"
"To say that Ben is more valuable than the Nets roster is absurd but I think it makes sense in what the Rockets want. LeVert Dinweddie and Allen are great pieces for a championship roster but not good enough to be the main core of the franchise like Simmons can, which is more important for a Harden-less Rockets."
"shooting 1 three instead of 0 threes in a game isn't gonna make ben simmons a better shooter. If Ben Simmons ever becomes better at shooting, that's gonna be done behind the scenes. The idea that Ben Simmons shooting struggles is because of mental issues or confidence issues is completely false."
"Same here, he was open and it's a good shot. I hope people don't push the whole ""Ben Simmons needs to attempt threes"" and then as soon as he misses they start to make it out like it's a massive lowlight."
Keep shooting son! Good to see some positivity in a Ben Simmons shooting post for a change
ben simmons what a sniper!!!
Ben Simmons should take those but not too often. Maybe Doc encouraging him
ben simmons
"So your arguments have been let me overstate Ben Simmons skills and downplay Draymond's? I love them both as players but they're probably way closer then you're suggesting. I think Ben Simmons is currently more valuable and  but Simmons has a lot more to prove before you talk about him as a definitive star that sets him apart in terms of legacy. Draymond is a DPOY level superstar role player and I'm not sure Simmons has proven he's more than that. You overstate his ability to create his own shot. He can drive for sure but is afraid to get fouled and that definitely reflects in his game. Let's not forget he got relegated to the dunkers position. While some of the blame should be placed on Brett Brown, it also a result in Simmons inability on offense. Again, I love both players but you're coming off as a Homer imo."
Philly fans: does Ben Simmons not look to score in transition very much? My limited exposure to him seems to indicate that he just tries to ser up shooters primarily
I love shitting on Ben Simmons.
I agree.  Oh is that a Ben Simmons thread?  brb
might as well load manage embiid today and let ben simmons command the offense today.
Yes if they can do the following  1. Joel Embiid stays healthy  2. Ben Simmons cancels out one of the Jays 3. Seth Curry/Tobias Harris can play at 80% of their current levels.
Now I‚Äôm imagining ben simmons flanked by prime Steph curry and Klay Thompson. And FMVP Iguodala while we‚Äôre at it
"Nah I'm with you. Ppl think you need to be chasing rings at all costs. I watch every game and like watching Ben and the defensive identity. Obviously harden is better than Simmons, doesn't mean that i have to want to make that trade."
Ben Simmons slander gonna get me a black card in r/nba
Do people like Ben Simmons that much? Is there no possible better offer for him?
"Why is he averaging so many assists? I haven't had have the fortune to watch a NY Knicks' game, but he just became some kind of Ben simmons or what?"
"Ben Simmons is useless in a half court offense and in tight games, hence his playoff issues. Give me the guy that‚Äôs gonna help you win titles not regular season games."
So a player that excels with good players around him as opposed to whatever the fuck Ben Simmons turns into when he had Jimmy Butler? A player you hide on the baseline in half court offenses during the most important games of the year. Give me ‚Äútriple single‚Äù with the three rings.  See game 7 Draymond.
Ben Simmons has more 3 pointers made this year than Jimmy Butler.
"Well he isn‚Äôt better than Harden or Luka, wasn‚Äôt better than Dame.  Was he better than CP3, Lowry, or Ben Simmons?  At scoring, sure, but Simmons is an otherworldly defender, CP3 and Lowry were leading their teams to winning records as playmaking point guards and capable defenders.  One of those guys has to be kicked off for Beal to be all-NBA.    I can see him as All-NBA this year, but Curry is back, so that makes it harder.  Looks like Lowry and CP3 may slide off due to aging, but Trae Young is killing it.  Is Beal one of the best 6 guards in the NBA?  That‚Äôs tough man  He will probably be an all star this year and could be all-NBA depending on how other guys fare, but making an all-NBA team means he‚Äôs one of the best 6 guards in the NBA, and I‚Äôm not sure he was last year."
Triple single refers to his titles right? We can call Ben Simmons ‚ÄúThe Big O‚Äù because of his laughable playoff history.
Ben Simmons was getting lit up by ish smith
I would actually not blame him too much for that last Simmons dunk when he went to double Embiid. There were no good options at that point imo. He's on Simmons and that is BBQ chicken in the post. Ball goes to Embiid and he decides to go for the quick steal before Jo can face up and attack or pass with vision. Doesn't work but honestly if he stayed with Ben I don't see that working out great either.
If there name is ben simmons
"1. They have not just surrounded Ben and Embiid with shooters, they have surrounded them with shooters who can attack a closeout and make plays off the dribble. Saric, Cov, and Redick were limited in that regard.   2. Coach Rivers is weaponizing Simmons in the halfcourt. Both Rivers and Brown prefer three out rather than four out spacing during post play (Rivers always has, it isn't just a product of him having Ben, lol) with someone in the dunker's spot. But what Simmons is doing there has changed dramatically. He's cutting way more frequently, posting smaller players on high low action, setting a ton of screens to get players open and just generally making sure that he is affecting the play and having to be accounted for. It's a massive difference that won't show up in the stat sheet unless he scores.   3. The defense is playing up on pick and rolls more while still being able to guard the rim. They are playing excellent defense at the rim while not resorting to packing the paint like the Bucks do, so they are still able to defend the three point line well.   4. Embiid has gotten *much* better at reading double teams. He is inviting them and making the right pass.   5. Harris has improved tremendously this far on defense and is making quicker decisions on offense. Him at the four is a much more dangerous player than he is at the three. It's like we added another player."
"They banned me for saying that Joel Embiid needed to go back to Africa, even though I explained that I'm not saying that in a racist way. I said it because he's from Cameroon, which is in Africa. If I were bashing Ben Simmons, I'd say he needs to take his ass back to Australia."
Simmons and Tobi without embiid had a great net rating last year. Tobi and Embiid had a weirdly awful  rating last year. Tobi and Ben compliment each other well.

"Ben ""Steph Curry"" Simmons"
"So far it‚Äôs really simple but idk how you stop it.  Both Ben and jo are really good low post offensive players, and given that Ben is either against 4s or shorter you almost have to help on his post ups.  Also not a lot is talked about how good of a passer Ben is out of the low post, shown by this play.  You also can‚Äôt leave Embiid 1 on 1 either for obvious reasons.  So the shooters are having a ludicrous amount of space to work with with.  60%+ of Seth curry‚Äôs 3s are wide open looks (defender 4+ feet away) which his why he is shooting so well.  So as a defense you have to choose whether or not you want two absolute snipers raining 3s on you, or Embiid and Simmons are going to back you down all game.  It‚Äôs so refreshing after watching Brett Browns offense for 3 seasons."
"It takes one look at his post history to tell he's a Clippers fan, dude had a trade proposal with Ben Simmons going to the Clippers, he's had a PG MVP post and several posts about how the Clippers are looking unbeatable and Lakers have no chance of coming out of the west cause of the Clippers"
Ben Simmons the most overrated dude in the league!!  You got him hiding on the baseline during the playoffs not letting him handle the ball. Check draymonds playoff record....then you can talk.
Earlier today I was downvoted to hell for saying Draymond is no longer a all-star and his best days are behind him.  Some people even said he was on the same tier as Ben Simmons. Smh  This 2k really got these kids minds messed up.
Someone tried to tell he was better than Ben SimmonsüíÄüíÄand it was 100% deadass like bro dude don‚Äôt even start for his teamüò≠üò≠
Ben Simmons is Draymond 3 years ago but more athletic and better defense.  Draymond is a role player just accept it. Calling him a all-star is embarrassing. Dude can't score and he's not doing anything else if he isn't finding Steph off screens.  4/6/6 that is just pathetic!
No just stating facts. He's a triple single vet now. Role player not even close to all-star like I said.  But he's on Ben Simmons level though.üòÇü§£
Lol and you guys act like the second coming of Draymond is untradable . Ben simmons is Draymond....
"We did , by the Celtics without Ben Simmons"
people have said that about every player covered by Ben simmons so far this year.  He is a very good defender and forces good players into quiet nights.
maybe Oubre should take the Ben Simmons approach
"He‚Äôs actually been pretty good on offense this year, his big issue is against a really good defending guard/team (see Ben Simmons). He has a habit where the defender will sag off and gauge his 3. If it‚Äôs a miss and then he misses another then say goodbye to his shot confidence for the night. He starts slashing the lane and forcing passes. But other than that when he gets in a rhythm I see great improvement from last year where there was never really a rhythm and he would just be inconsistent."
He had a better game than Ben Simmons. Was Ben trash tonight?
Thank you Ben Simmons
"Ben simmons, or maybe ja"
"Ben simmons is 8 inches taller, and 40 pounds heavier lol"
"Forget Jaylen brown, I‚Äôd take bill Simmons over Ben."
Are you telling me ben simmons isn't capable of backing down russell?
Ish Smith is cooking all defensive player Ben simmons
Yeah I remember seeing some stat in Ben Simmons' first year that he had more career shots from his own half than Durant
&gt;Both of the Jays pass just as well as Ben Simmons  Slow down pal
Both of the Jay's pass just as well as Ben Simmons imo and potentially improve and be better throughout the season.
Does this mean you would rather have Ja than Simmons or you‚Äôre just willing to add him along side Ben Simmons?
Ben Simmons making a 3 pointer
Interesting question.  I see Brown as a Jimmy Butler type.  Not the most talented but with an insatiable desire to win.  Ben Simmons has all the talent in the world with some amazing physical gifts but can't seem to put it all together.  The desire doesn't seem to be there and I'm not sure if that's because he's not all that into Philly or what.   I still think Simmons will be regarded as the better player even if Brown has the better stats.
me being a biased celtics fan is what makes me say that ben simmons is an awful shooter?
Shooting god Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons is a career 59% Free Throw shooter. his mechanics are awful. he cannot shoot.
"Just making a quick list (not very accurate) I‚Äôd put him in the 20-30 range. Your 16-22 range seems a little too optimistic.  Embiid, Giannis, Middleton, Durant, Harden, Kyrie, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Capela, Bam Adebayo, Gobert, LeBron, AD, Kawhi, Paul George, Chris Paul, DeRozan, Damian Lillard, Jokic, Steph, Christian Wood, Zion, Luka  That‚Äôs 24 players. All of these players besides Bam are on a team with a better record then the Knicks. You could probably put him over a few of them though.  Ben Simmons, Sabonis, Gordon Hayward, Lavine, Beal, Conley, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Fox  There‚Äôs 9 players kind of in that same range. Maybe below, maybe above Randle depending on your argument."
Definitely my favorite Ben Simmons rookie season.
"I just don‚Äôt see any comparison to RJ whatsoever.   The entire reason RJ struggles is he can‚Äôt shoot. Cade is shooting 43% on 3s and 84% from the line. He can shoot.  He may not be the playmaker Luka is, but extrapolating from playing with a shit OSU team that he‚Äôs not a playmaker at all is silly.   Ben Simmons averaged 4.8 assists to 3.4 turnovers in college. That‚Äôs only slightly better than what CC is doing. Judging playmaking by these types of college stats is silly."
"Jimmy"" Ben Simmons"" Butler"
Tell Ben Simmons that :( Donovan Mitchell ROY truther for life over here
Ben Simmons has made more threes then butler this seasons.
hes practically ben simmons with a jumpshot. His BBIQ is good hes a good defender a decent shooter i dont rly see a weakness in his game
Ben simmons takes away some of Jokic's passing lanes. Not being able to shoot clogs the floor.
Ben Simmons exists
Magic is basically Ben Simmons today
"Draymond decision is way worse because you literally have the best shooter in the world, because it was literally after receiving the in-bound pass (so he knew he had a little time to make the play that Kerr drew), he knew very well there was time to pass it to Curry.  Ben Simmons play he was the in-bound passer and he received the ball back after the designed shot by the coach so when he caught the rebound he was already on active mode and he didn't knew the shot clock so he just launched it afraid that the time was going to run up.  Draymond there is no decision whatsoever, it's just a brainfart. Makes no fucking sense."
"I can't really give you a reason for a specific game, I would have to watch that game. Was Valanciunas playing? He's usually going to grab more rebounds than then opposing center. Tillmann has also proven to be a good rebounder and Gorgui Dieng is an important part of the rotation. Not that many teams play three centers on a regular basis. But other teams with a strong frontcourt still fare well on the rebound department. Domantas Sabonis and Myles Turner combined for 24 rebounds in their win over the Grizzlies. Keldon Johnson of the Spurs had 10, DeAndre Ayton 16. Dwight Howard and Ben Simmons combined for 34 rebounds against them... These are just a few games played in January.  The Grizzlies actually rank 15h in rebounds per game and 16th in opponents rebounds per game, that's average. Here and there you're always going to find stretches where other team's bigs or in general aren't going to rebound as much."
"AD last season played 62 out of 72(?) games last season at 35 MPG and then played the entire playoffs.   Meanwhile, Embiid played 51 games, Ben Simmons 57, Jimmy Butler 58, Westbrook 57, Paul George 47... I could go on but I think you get the picture.  Please don't let Skip Bayless's takes cloud your judgment. Do some research. That man is a certified clown who only cherry-picks stats that promote his narrative/agenda and *never* makes a good-faith argument."
"Ben Simmons shot in the Embiid 0 point gane was worse, at least Draymond thought they were trying to foul him."
"When is the last time Ben Simmons had 8 steals in a game?  At worst, I think it's 1a and 1b. Murray is a fantastic playmaker on D, Ben is better at converting TOs to instant offense."
Would Ben Simmons be a better fit? Simmons + Jokic and Murray + Embid sounds sick. But Simmons shot making worries me
Just like Ben Simmons was just a lightskin Lebron even though young Lebron who was a poor shooter was never afraid to let it fly. Still had many 40 and 50 point games just taking jumpers in his younger years. Ben Simmons plays like a 6'10 Rajon Rondo.
"I don‚Äôt think Draymond will be able to anymore. He can‚Äôt score 10 points. Murray possibly has a chance. I think either Ben Simmons or Jokic are most likely. With Jokic it would basically require the defenders handing him to r ball but it‚Äôs possible. Ben just has to pop off. He can get 10 points rebounds and assist easily, just about going crazy and getting 10 steals."
Sounds like he needs Ben Simmons to feed him looks to the corner
Maybe Ben Simmons if he gets a bunch of steals? The points may be a stretch tho
I kept telling them it was a horrible comparison and that Simmons won't even shoot pass 8 feet from the basket. I seriously don't understand how people can call him a skinny Ben Simmons.
Remember when people on here said he was better than Ben Simmons after that first good game earlier this season
I read and argued on this sub and was told he is just a skinny Ben Simmons even though Simmons never even shoots a 3. I love seeing this and I love seeing all the haters have to eat their words.
"**Americans (11)**: Danny Green, Tyrese Maxey, Dwight Howard, Tobias Harris, Shake Milton, Isaiah Joe, Tony Bradley, Mike Scott, Terrance Ferguson, Paul Reed, Rayjon Tucker.  **Australians (2):** Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle.   **Cameroonians (1):** Joel Embiid.   **Turks (1):** Furkan Korkmaz.   **Frenchman (1):** Vincent Poirier."
You can‚Äôt have Ben Simmons and I don‚Äôt want Cousins.
Cousins and Jefferson for Wentz and Ben Simmons.  Lets get it done
"Kyle Lowry, Chris Paul is ~20 ppg, SGA, Brogdon, Ben Simmons/Lebron if you count them as PG,"
I mean if we just made basketball hockey Kemba Walker wouldn‚Äôt be able to play and Ben Simmons would dominate the league. Do we really want that (I do but seriously)?
I mean I can‚Äôt imagine having both Gobert AND Ben Simmons on the same team  And this team is already elite defensively
Chris Paul  Jrue Holiday  Ben Simmons  Jaren Jackson Jr  Kristaps Porzingis
Shocking news Ben Simmons has more 3pt assists than anyone else since he entered the league including last years roster that had no shooting
"Why are yall grouping Ben Simmons with Jason Kidd?  I'm grouping Simmons with those other dudes because they're similar playmakers; average halfcourt playmakers, can't really run an offense, but make the right passes and nice passes in transition &amp; kick outs.  Simmons' all stars means fuckin nothin in this conversation when we're strictly talking playmaking"
Bububububububut Ben Simmons hurts SPACING you need to have SPACING to play Joel Embiid they should‚Äôve traded Brick Simmons for D‚ÄôAngelo Russell?!??!?!
How about the 76ers. Allow Ben Simmons to soothe and calm you with his supple Australian arms. (Please tell me people remember.)
I like Ben Simmons. He's got a nice game and plays good defense. Also he seems like a chill gamer bro lmao
Ben Simmons makes some very clean passes
Shocking news ben simmons playing with starters so they shoot better from 3pt
"It's just frustrating as a Sixers/Simmons fan, because think of it this way - the all-defensive first team last year was AD/Smart/Gobert/Giannis/Simmons.  Setting aside Giannis and AD since they're top all-around players, imagine if Smart or Gobert had Simmons' playmaking ability? People would be talking about how amazing they are nonstop. I get that Ben has a glaring hole in his game, but there are absolutely people here who at least talk like he's not already a valuable player."
"Honestly just the double standard, Ben Simmons cant win in the playoffs because he cant shoot.  Giannis cant either but no one says anything about it."
Ben Simmons for playing way better and Shake Milton for playing worse.
"I think it‚Äôs the inverse. Ben Simmons without shooting is a good player. But if he could just hit 30% of his threes on a few attempts per game, he could be a perennial MVP candidate."
Doesn‚Äôt him and Ben Simmons have beef. That‚Äôd be interesting.
Ben Simmons is the goat
"Ben Simmons, noted bench player."
This take just shows you looked at his stats and not him playing. He would do just fine today. AI was extremely athletic and an elite finisher he would feast going to the rim in today's league. You can talk all you want about the zone but today's rim protectors are nothing like what he had back then.   He didn't have a great shot but he wasnt Ben Simmons. Calling him an Isaiah Thomas without a shot is so wrong and disrespectful
"idk why people act like Ben Simmons isn't simultaneously a DPOY candidates and one of the top ten drive and kick threats in the NBA. dudes basically a 6'10"" young Jason Kidd. Embiid is the unstoppable half court guy but Ben brings a lot more value than people understand."
"Stolen from someone in our sub yesterday, but it bears repeating because it makes so much sense:  Simmons determines the floor of our offense. Embiid determines its ceiling. When Ben isn't around to open up opportunities for our shooters with his vision and passing, there's stagnation when those shots can't get created. That's what we saw against the Blazers last week."
Ben Simmons according to r/nba
"Donovan Mitchell, Jaylen Brown, Klay, Ben Simmons, Embiid"
Tell that to Ben simmons lol
"Where are my arguments poor? I‚Äôm not the one who brought up finishing at the rim, and i know Ben is the superior defender. I said Ben Simmons is better and Lonzo doesn‚Äôt deserve anywhere near his pay. The whole point of my post was that the production people clown Lonzo for is not that far behind Simmons who everyone considers to be an elite player. I did a purely statistical analysis here. I chose Simmons specifically because as you can see in the stats, they are very close in their stats in many ways. Identical usage, nearly identical OFFRTG, etc. This was to show that what this sub thinks he deserves to be paid is likely not the same as what a FO will pay for him. These are the kind of arguments Rich Paul will be making in the summer. I could also compare him to people making $20 mil and make an argument for Lonzo falling in that range."
Butker has made more 3s in this game than Ben Simmons the whole season
"I'd trade draymond and the t-wolves pick for ben simmons.  Perhaps a four way trade between boston, was, phi and gsw.  Gsw - In: Simmons. Out: Dray, TWolves pick, warriors 1st round pick.  Oubre.  Boston - In:  Draymond.  Out:. Two 1st round draft pick  Sixers: In - beal.  Out - ben simmons, maxine.  Wash:. In - maxine, oubre, t-wolves pick, warriors pick, 2 boston picks out - beal."
"No, Sixers already have Ben Simmons already who is kind of like a younger Dray. Obviously not a perfect comparison by any means but that's my rough take."
he didn't have a coach and Ben Simmons tbf
one more win than Kemba has against Ben Simmons
"And THAT is why the sixers should have been traded Ben Simmons.   And before people mention defense, what good is Simmons‚Äô defense when he won‚Äôt be stopping Kyrie or KD"
"Fuckers in school telling me, always in the barbershop. Markelle Fultz can‚Äôt shoot 3s, Markelle Fultz fucked his free throw. My boy weak, he got the yips or something. He, he say that boy ain‚Äôt been putting in work. SHUT THE FUCK UP! Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt know shit! All ya motherfuckers talk about Fultz ain‚Äôt no hitter, Fultz a bust, Fultz a fake SHUT THE FUCK UP! Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt live with that boy! You know that boy got shout-out from KD, shooting hesi pull ups and shit. Kelle been pullin up since fucking.... I don‚Äôt know when. Motherfuckers stop fucking playin him like that. Them boys ballin out here. If I catch another Tatum or Big Baller Ass Laker motherfucker talking sweet about ‚ÄòKelle I‚Äôm beating they fucking ass! I‚Äôm not fucking playing no more, you know those boys roll with Ben Simmons and them!"
Ben Simmons we all hate him
this is why ben simmons didn't try to dunk on trae
Ben Simmons is a great basketball player will win a chip without ever needing a jumpshot someday.
"Alright here‚Äôs mine: the Bird/Johnson debate really shouldn‚Äôt be a debate at all. If we‚Äôre considering how great players would be across generations and not looking at them solely based on how they performed in their era, the two aren‚Äôt even comparable.   Magic Johnson in this era would be viewed the same way we view Ben Simmons currently, albeit with less defensive capability and greater playmaking capability. His size at PG wouldn‚Äôt be the advantage is was then, and teams would absolutely exploit his inability to shoot, especially in the playoffs. He‚Äôs seen as an all-time great because he played on relatively stacked teams his entire career in an era where players didn‚Äôt need to be able to shoot to win games.   Bird, on the other hand, would most likely be even more dominant in the current era than he was when he played. The man was averaging nearly 30 points a game on almost 50/40/90 shooting in his prime while taking *1.9 three point shots per game over the course of his career*. Could you imagine what his stats would look like if he took 8.6 threes a game like Steph has over the course of his career? I wholeheartedly believe Bird would be an unequivocal top 3 player of all time with LeBron and Jordan if he‚Äôd played in a more recent era or didn‚Äôt injure himself and end his career prematurely."
I'll stop shitposting about Ben Simmons when I'm dead
"Lol that is a joke. Even 2 seasons ago when lebron didn't make the playoffs after declaring he activitated dark mode, he was clowned beyond belief. And he has achieved far more than ben simmons. Even the steady clowning of Schroeder everyday compares. The sub is toxic i guess. But it's not that deep."
"On a very serious note, the free throw line is call the damn CHARITY STRIPE for a reason!!! It NEVER moves and you get 10 seconds to take your shot (sans Giannis).   I'm always amazed that there's folks who shoot less than 80% on a professional level and sometimes wonder if it's just pure laziness. It's the ultimate open book test with your teacher and peers waiting for you to finish looking up the answers in front of your face. You just put the ball in the net with a straight forward motion. There's NBA players that are so efficient at this motion of shooting straight that it's amazing when they miss! Lillard for example looks disgusted he even has to shoot his and Curry shoots as if he's just playing around, to name a few notables. The spoils of riches to rack up easy money....  You can't go 30-50% in the playoffs at the line. That should never happen. It's for that reason why I don't buy into this Ben Simmons hype that he can easily just transplant himself on another team. This man is going to really need some massaging and boosting as his peers are gleefully ready to knock him out the way and take his fame."
"""Ben simmons working on his 3 point shot."""
Ben Simmons not shooting isn‚Äôt the problem
Ben Simmons to shoot
Ben Simmons is a top 30 player
Thanks for this post. I was worried that Ben Simmons' shooting was escaping Reddit's attention. /s
Ben Simmons didn‚Äôt play well in the playoffs? First I‚Äôm hearing of this
Ben Simmons has more self confidence than any one on this sub.
You forgot ben simmons
"Ben Simmons is an underrated, All-NBA PG who you can build a contender around. He just had a bad series so now Reddit shits on him unfairly."
Well at least we realize how much Ben Simmons sucks after he absolutely shits the bed and costs us the series. Nobody in Philly is trying to argue that Simmons is better than Kobe lol
Ben Simmons is worth 4 1st round picks.
I think I‚Äôve scrolled past like four Ben Simmons posts today alone. r/nba makes me want him to succeed just so the echo chamber shuts the fuck up
The problem with Ben Simmons game isn‚Äôt relevant in the regular season  Expect him to make another All Star team and for people to call him underrated and say if you don‚Äôt like him you‚Äôre a ‚Äúcasual‚Äù
 Nah we‚Äôll just say ‚ÄúI thought Ben Simmons was bad‚Äù on positive Ben Simmons posts  And it‚Äôs not even close
Ben Simmons doesn‚Äôt care about basketball
Ben Simmons is worth Morey‚Äôs asking price.
This dude just wakes up and is like ight time to post about Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons is really good
I would relish Ben Simmons too
Ben Simmons is a great basketball player
Ben Simmons has more value than this sub thinks he does.
haha Ben Simmons cant shoot free throws!!11           &lt;&lt;&lt; upvote here
Ben Simmons is actually good at basketball
This comment has me reminiscing on the Ben Simmons/Mona Lisa post from a couple years ago.
Ben Simmons isn‚Äôt trash
Ben Simmons is an championship caliber co-star
Ben Simmons is underrated
Ben Simmons is a young socialite
This sub legitimately only talks about two things during the off-season and Ben Simmons is both of those things
Ben Simmons is a negative asset. Robert Williams got over paid. Give me Ja on my team over Zion (I‚Äôm biased.
"When he said this 4 years ago, he definitely knew that he'd shoot 30% below his career averages in the biggest playoff run of his life. How could Ben Simmons lie like that?"
"You seriously think in 2-4 years Malcolm Brogdon, DeJounte Murray, and Caris LeVert could be considered better than Ben Simmons? This is ridiculous, sorry.  People are criticizing Ben Simmons bc he can't be the second best guy on a finals team. A Sabonis, Brogdon, and LeVert core couldn't even make the playoffs."
Ben Simmons
"But again, Ben Simmons is not MOST people. Plenty of people work their hardest at much shittier occupations to prove their worth. Expectations come with huge contracts and it is perfectly reasonable for a complacent athlete to draw ire from people who eat shit for a living."
"kobe‚Äôs not top 15 all time, role players and defense wins championships, luka wont make it out of the first round as long as he‚Äôs in Dallas, Ben Simmons still is worth multiple first round picks, and Tatum will want out at the end of his deal after realizing that the FO won‚Äôt pull the lever to make a trade for a third superstar"
Ben Simmons is worth a harden package
Would also help if anybody on that roster played a shred of defense. Ben Simmons would help them so much....
this may be number 1 unless like somebody posts ben simmons is the goat. or shroder.
"Ben Simmons is still an all star despite his playoff woes. Because let's remember, it is a regular season award and he is really good in the regular season."
Tip: always research your topic before making absolute statements. Both [Draft Express](https://247sports.com/Gallery/DraftExpress-releases-updated-2016-NBA-mock-draft-45538898/Amp/) and [Kevin O'Connor](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2016/6/22/12001638/nba-mock-draft-2016-ben-simmons-brandon-ingram-lakers-76ers-celtics) had Simmons at #1.
"&gt;  I think we only think of him as shit because he was supposed to live up to a contract/expectations. &gt;  &gt; I bet he turns into a quality unselfish big like javale or dwight. That‚Äôs my hot take of the year  you know how there was that stream with ben simmons saying he didn't need a shot because he had 10 assists and 5 dunks a game so he was creating 30 points a night? that's what i think of when i see drummond's name except it's ""i don't need to be good because i get 20 rebounds a night, that's possessions baby!"""
"He is top 5 right now, but that status is getting more precarious by the second.    You could make a strong argument that Brown, Ingram, Sabonis, and Siakam are all better than him right now, and the book isn‚Äôt closed on guys like Brogdon, Murray (both Jamal and Dejounte), and LeVert.    Simmons was by far the most NBA ready player in that class, and he‚Äôs still got the elite playmaking, slashing, and defense that he was drafted for, but it‚Äôs very easy to make the case that he‚Äôs still basically the same player that he was in year 1 while all of the other guys have been steadily improving.  I would not be surprised if Ben Simmons was not seen as a top 5 player in his class in 2-4 years."
Ben Simmons.
"What do you think of about replacing wiseman and one of the other two for Ben Simmons? Maybe a pick or two more ü•∫  Edit: to be clear, we still get dame in this scenario, I'm sorry Portland"
"younger, better, stronger, etc. yeah that is typically how it goes.   its not just age tbough. ben simmons is younger than kawhi also."
this is the best off-season content so far! Way more entertaining than ben simmons jibberish
1. Greg oden  2. Kwame brown  3. Ben Simmons  Doesn‚Äôt elaborate
"Well, not right now. He does have some lapses when defending and isn't as dominant a perimeter defender as Ben Simmons. But that's why i said the next few years."
"I don't know how you got that assumption. Dude just said KAT is better than Simmons. Maybe he's wrong, I don't think he is, but you're making some serious leaps in your attempt to defend Ben.  I'm a Piston's fan and I legit think a Simmons/Cunningham backcourt would wreak havoc on the NBA.  I  wholeheartedly love Simmons' game, but KAT is a better player."
Ben Simmons was the Cade Cunningham pick of that year. Everyone and their mothers know you had to pick him at one and just live with it.
I‚Äôd say Ben Simmons. Best wing defender in the league imo
"I‚Äôm honestly not trolling, I think KAT would be number 11 right after Simmons. I think KAT is infinitely better as a personal versatile scorer but that‚Äôs it. After that, I think Ben Simmons is better than KAT in way more things‚Ä¶maybe mentally not so much haha"
kat easily over ben simmons
Those are all the people who said draft Ben Simmons
"I think there is enough similarities between Ben Simmons and Rudy Gobert to make a comparison. Both are premier defensive players, with very clear limitations regarding their offense and are seen as all-star level players, but what their actual value is has been quite controversial."
"I'm told that in addition to 2 all stars, 3 blue chip rookies, and 5 future FRPs, Morey is now also asking for team personnel. With the number of spots cleared today, a Ben Simmons trade is among the smoke."
"Oh I'm not trying to make a judgement on whether CP3 is an all-time-great, just that I'm avoiding combinations where there are *two* all-time-greats (I like Ben Simmons more than most on reddit but he's unlikely to be an all-timer)."
"Philly.  I get it, Ben Simmons isn't great, but they're still gonna be a top 3 seed, and you're crazy if you think otherwise."
A low usage guard who plays defense and shoots threes is more valuable when you have Ben Simmons and Anthony Edwards handling things on offense.
"Seth kinda sucks, tbh. Kerr was a better shooter overall, his brother is a better player, and Mugsy was better on defense.   Oh well, at least that team has Ben Simmons."
I think it‚Äôs Miami although we have to see what happens with Ben Simmons and the Sixers
#BEN SIMMONS GET OUT HERE!
Sixers at home vs anybody just to see if the crowd boos ben simmons
Ben Simmons vs Joel Embiid. After whenever/wherever Simmons gets traded
"Also that one season where DLO lead the Nets into the playoffs and Jared Dudley was beefing with Ben ‚ÄúAverage in the Half-court‚Äù Simmons.  They weren‚Äôt a great team, but man were they fun."
3/30. I wouldn't have offered Terry more than 3/36 in 2019 after his shitshow of a season. Only thing that got Terry 57 million was him saucing on drew bledsoe and ben simmons in the playoffs the year before
"Ben Simmons(defense, size, quickness) and Steph Curry(shooting, off ball movement, ball handling, confidence)"
"How about Orlando as a 3rd team? Something like this:  Minnesota receives: Ben Simmons  Philly receives: Patrick Beverly, Cole Anthony, Terrence Ross, Gary Harris, Minnesota 2024 1st Rounder, Minnesota 2026 1st Rounder  Orlando receives: Minnesota 2022 1st Rounder, Minnesota 2024 2nd Rounder, throw in players to make salaries work.  It's a decent start I think"
Ben Simmons + Chris Paul is basically a better taller lebron lol
Funniest thing is that any way you look at it its still a better deal then Ben Simmons
"Ben Simmons has always been a grab the rebound, push the ball at lightning speed, stop at the free throw line and jump pass to someone else, kind of guy"
"He absolutely does. Doc Rivers showed his hand and pissed off Ben Simmons in that post game press conference. He's not coming back and hasn't communicated with the team all offseason. 76ers still have an opportunity to get a fair return for Simmons, but the market is evaporating. The longer Ben holds out, the more time will pass where he hasn't played professionally which will further decrease his value. Morey is a smart guy, he's not gonna let his value decrease by holding onto him for the entire year."
They have a conference finals berth peak and perineal second round playoff team written all over them. No more of a contender than the Sixers with Ben Simmons.
"Without relying on combinations of two all-time-greats;  * Ben Simmons + Chris Paul. This is mostly an excuse to get Chris Paul in a 6'11 body with good rebounding.  * Khris Middleton + Zion Williamson. Shoot from anywhere in defenders faces, Zion's touch at the rim - you'd have to bite on a pump fake, and before you land he's dunked it. Also get Zion with good defense and a bit more height.  * KAT + Steven Adams. There's better options, but it'd just change the rules for what either teams can do with picks; other team doing a pick and roll? Absolutely not. Your team runs a pick and pop? Easiest points you'll ever score."
Ben Simmons and mpj
Ben Simmons (body/defense) + Steph Curry (finishing/shooting)
Naw league still on notice from Ben ‚Äú34% from the line‚Äù Simmons
When you‚Äôre not playing him PF next to Ben Simmons he plays a lot better
"Ingram is actually a good playmaker. Ben Simmons does most of his playmaking in transition or passing to shooters running off screens. Ingram does his playmaking in the half court using the pnr. He basically ran PG for us a lot last year, just like Zion and  Lonzo did. Maybe even more."
"Boston has all their picks and just got rob Williams on a very tradeable contract, I'm skeptical beal wants out but if he does the wiz have no leverage and the C's would be able to put together the best package they could realistically get (other than mb Ben Simmons) and not have to give up brown."
"Yes ""assets go to Portland.""  WHAT assets.  Fuck that could be worse than just getting Ben Simmons.  The post seems worried about the return for Simmons but not the return for the better player that is Dame.  You dont just trade Dame for picks and some role players."
"For sure, and I agree it would have to be Ben + for Fox. Ben for Hield+ is another story imo but even that is very close.  At the end of the day, while Simmons is a dud in the playoffs he has proven that with or without Embiid playing he can lead a regular team to a playoff spot (albeit Western conference is another story). The Kings are one of the few teams in the league where even just Ben bringing his old self is an upgrade for them. They‚Äôve tried to patiently develop their young players before and that hasn‚Äôt worked, why not take a chance with Ben."
"Steph Curry and Draymond Green always seem to become top 10 All-time players whenever Portland is involved.  If they play again in the postseason, we bouta see Steph whip out some windmill dunks and Draymond start launching from half court.   It goes:  1) Portland Steph  2) Portland Dray  3) Ben Simmons in practice videos  4) gap  5) some scrub named Michael Jeffrey Jordan"
Trading for Ben Simmons is the most on brand thing the T-Wolves could possibly do.  It's just so obviously a bad idea.
"Still kinda weird for me because he‚Äôs higher than every other #1 pick other than Kyrie, LeBron, Ben Simmons, and Davis"
"Sixers fans pick and choose which reports to listen to. It‚Äôs also been widely reported Ben isn‚Äôt responsive to the team and sixers fans are saying the relationship is fine. It was also widely reported Simmons doesn‚Äôt practice/care for his shooting and sixers fans until recently thought that was fake too.  Ever since that kawhi shot, the fan base has been a bit unhinged"
"If you ask Ben Simmons, having the mental strength required to run and dunk on fools even when fully healthy is something else entirely."
"Kings value fox more than ben at this point and 76ers want fox + more. Its just not gonna happen tbh. Even if philly said fox for ben straight up, kings probably wont move their guy who avg 25 a game and has caused them no problems. Ben is proving to everyone hes more than willing to sit out playing for a team if he doesnt like his situation. Unless he comes out and says he will play for Sacramento, we probably dont even come to the negotiating table. Kings fans still hate Jason Terry for doing this to us. We traded for him and he never even came to Sacramento so we had to trade him to another team. Plus ben simmons has rich paul as his agent and fuck that guy"
"The landscape for mediocre teams in recent years is to develop talent &amp; flip them for the best player available. I think having Beal on roster gives you a great opportunity to flip your own young players + picks instead of necessarily building around them, pretty much what the Wolves/Spurs are hoping to do for Ben Simmons right now."
"Hey guys I have a twitch stream where I talk NBA Top Shot, and how Ben Simmons will eventually win MVP and lead the Sixers down broad street.   &amp;#x200B;  It's basically me being a buffoon for a couple hours and its a lot of fun. Hope you guys enjoy.  &amp;#x200B;  [https://twitch.tv/jimbo\_M2G](https://twitch.tv/jimbo_M2G)"
"To be clear I agree Jordan is a better scorer but your arguments are ridiculous. Acting like LeBron is Ben Simmons and not the guy who carried the Heat in 2013 game 6 before the Ray Allen shot, the guy who single handedly beat the 07 Pistons with his scoring etc."
"Chauncey, if you replace Dame with Ben Simmons, your defense immediately improves."
 &gt;point Blake back in 2014  see it as what Ben Simmons could be.
Sounds a little like how most of us Sixers fans feel about Ben Simmons lmao
Without a doubt Ben Simmons.
" &gt;	The fact that Draymond could do all of what Simmons can do while also being better at the one thing he can‚Äôt.   I mean that‚Äôs just not true. You‚Äôre speaking in total hyperbole. Simmons is a better ball handler, a better driver, and a better finisher at the rim.    Dray is better defensively. he can do everything and can elevate your teams defense. I would give Ben a slight edge on the perimeter. He‚Äôs much quicker and longer."
He had some horrible games in the playoffs he disappear game 3 and 4 and 7 against the jazz and went back to normal production against the clippers and lakers at the time we also had grants defense something we are currently struggling a lot without ben simmons would give us the defense and focus more on being a scorer not a playmaker as he would be the third or second option instead of the fourth as in the sixers
i'd take jalen brunson over ben simmons  tbh
"Comparing within one team to show how RAPTOR gets a little crazy:  Shake Milton, Def. On/Off RAPTOR: +7.6 Ben Simmons, Def. On/Off RAPTOR: -5.2  Sorry, but any stat that considers Shake Milton to be a significantly better defender than Ben Simmons isn't passing the eye test."
Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons. He is the most polarizing player in the NBA.
If you just had raw data of how many topics a player had about him but no other info and you didn't watch basketball you would assume Ben Simmons was the best player on the planet.
"Damn, r/nba almost went an entire hour without some sort of ""fuck Ben Simmons"" or ""the Sixers suck"" post. That must be close to a new record."
Ben Simmons =/= Goran Dragic
what does ben simmons have to do with this
28 is the same 3P% as Ben Simmons last year and you're telling me that's not good?
LOL you probably said the exact same thing when anybody questioned the 2018-19 or 2019-20 Sixers. It's pretty obvious that any team with Ben Simmons as its main ball handler isn't gonna win shit.
Shaq was a centre. He didn‚Äôt need to shoot. Ben Simmons is a guard. Shooting is supposed to be a key element of their game to stretch the floor. I‚Äôd be saying the same for Shaq if he couldn‚Äôt rebound. I‚Äôm not trying to pile on Simmons and I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs great at other aspects but for these guards to not have a base core element of the game is crazy.
You should watch a Sixers game sometime. You might learn about why Ben Simmons is good at basketball.
please dont put lonzo ball and ben simmons in the same sentence
That was just Lebron lashing out at his stepdad Embiid. Either way LeBron's other stepdad Ben Simmons set him straight after that
Ben Simmons üò∂
The issue is that Ben Simmons has legitimately not changed at all from his rookie season stat wise
Ben Simmons will never average 1 three per game. I‚Äôd be shocked if he ever averaged like .5 3‚Äôs
"Lamelo, Anthony Edwards, ja morant, Zion Williamson, SGA, Collin Sexton, the Celtics superstars (Brown and Tatum are both near superstars), Embiid , Ben Simmons , De‚ÄôAron Fox , there‚Äôs so much talent in the league rn you can go on and on ."
Simmons can score in the paint when he decides to shoot and if you wait until he is 5 ft away he is going to score especially when he is 7 inches taller than the guy covering him.  Do you really think Joe Harris is going to stop Ben Simmons when he decides to go to the rim?
Ben Simmons must love playing against LeBron. He always shows up big in those games. Now we just need to convince someone on every other team to wear a LeBron mask so we can see the All Star version of Ben Simmons on a more consistent basis.
"Some of these deals are really bad for WAS. The price for Beal should be similar to Harden‚Äôs. He‚Äôs not as good but he‚Äôs four years younger.   PHL receives: Beal  MIN receives: Ben Simmons  WAS receives: Anthony Edwards, Danny Green, MIN 2021 FRP, PHL 2023+2027 FRP, PHL first rd swaps in 2024+2026."
"Ben and Joel can‚Äôt play together. Your options are to watch this happen in real time every year in the playoffs for half a decade and waste Joel‚Äôs prime, or to move him for an all star point guard who‚Äôs the same age and actually needs to be guarded. You‚Äôre also spending 30 million every year on simmons, so if you think creative rosters will save you, all I can say is good luck."

Enter Ben Simmons
"We winning the title if can trade Simmons for Beal. We need Beal and fits perfect with the team. Never wanted Harden, hopefully this happens. Ever since Ben Simmons said he mentally wasn‚Äôt there cause contract reasons in the playoffs when we were 1 missed Kawhi shot from the NBA finals has irked me bad. I just can‚Äôt look past that like real competitors don‚Äôt care about that shit in big games. We need Beal"
Did you know that Ben Simmons is 6'10?
"What I‚Äôm saying is that up to this point in his career, he doesn‚Äôt seem to give a shit about going to a contender. He wants to win yet keeps playing for a bad team. The FO has no leverage right now since teams realize if he‚Äôs not traded, he‚Äôs just gonna walk anyways. They fucked themselves all these years by never picking up the phone. The sixers are already contenders without him with Embiid and Simmons, so why give up Simmons for Beal when he‚Äôs gonna be a FA in 2 years and you can sign him the when Ben is 26 and Embiid is 28. This isn‚Äôt a lebron situational where lebron is 34."
"You‚Äôre overlooking the 2020-1 Sixers: 3x DPOY Dwight, 3x NBA Champion Danny Green, with 2x MVP (2021,2023) 3x DPOY (2021, 2023-2024) Embiid, DPOY (2022) Ben Simmons, 2025/2027 MVP and scoring leader Shake Milton, 2026/2028 MVP and 2032 MIP Tyrese Maxey, all time 3pt leader at retirement (2033) Seth Curry, and 6x Emmy-nominated James Michael Scott, OBE."
"yea man Simmons is a smart player but you gotta know your personnel there. Like if there were 2 seconds and it was either a Ben shot or Green shot I get it, but there was substantial time and he put Green, a player who isnt a creator, in a tough situation. Happy for the win, but the problems of having a player who struggles to create off the dribble in the half court will remain a problem. Embiid's usually pretty good down the stretch, but there are times when its difficult to get good entries (plus post ups are a bit tougher at the end of games when you want to run clock, since you can double harder without fear of swinging across the perimeter if there are 4 seconds on the shot clock)."
ben simmons and a reddit 50 50 post.
philly won‚Äôt be able to get Beal without giving up Ben and it would have to be a 3 team trade because the Wizards wouldn‚Äôt want both Russ and Simmons
"Sixers winning this game wasn‚Äôt a surprise. An absolute elite team and anybody who disagrees haven‚Äôt been watching much Sixers basketball this season. Embiid is top two for the MVP (so far) this season and he‚Äôs not two. Ben is playing elite defense and getting his teammates involved in all aspects of the game, even without shooting jumpers (as a Sixers fan it makes me mad he hasn‚Äôt expanded his game, so slander can be made here) but if slander is made, at least acknowledge how valuable he is in other areas of the game as well. Tobias is playing arguably his best career basketball. Seth Curry is lights out and shooting career highs. Shake Milton is a 6MOTY candidate, if not front runner. Dwight Howard is adding a much needed spark in the absence of Joel when he is on the bench.   And last but not least, our commander Doc Rivers is the much needed coaching expertise our young core needed. Sixers by an absolute million and I‚Äôll see you guys in the finals.  Edit; Sixers are an elite team barring any major injuries to Ben Simmons or worse, Joel Embiid, since he is the heart and soul of this squad."
/r/nba: Ben Simmons
"if you told me before the game that Ben Simmons would get a triple double, a blocked shot, have only one turnover, but go negative +/-....  I'd say ""ok"""
"Not over Randle who‚Äôs having a career year carrying the Knicks. But with Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler and Siakam potentially missing out, Tobias chances are looking great"
"The Lakers got away with hiding, 6'1 Dennis Schroder on 6'10 Ben Simmons in the 4th. Fucking pathetic."
joel embid and ben simmons take turns flopping all game
"I kind of have to admit though, I keep forgetting Simmons' first name is Ben..."
"Thank you for this I thought I was the only one this bothered. Im a pretty huge NBA fan that has an old Lakers jersey my step dad bought me from the strip mall in our hometown of Spearfish South Dakota. When Im at the local Applebees bar hittin on strange sipping my draft bud light I like to impress the ladyfolk by commenting on the game. Today I accidentally confused Lebron James and Ben Simmons because the stupid jersey color was wrong! Wendy the bartender laughed at me and totally cock blocked me from this solid 7 I was flirting with, pretty sure shes a lez anyway. NBA needs to stick to the jerseys we know or how else am I supposed to follow the action!"
Hard on Lebron that he only has Davis on his team while Embiid gets to play with someone as good Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons runs like he's gliding on ice.  Sooooo sexy
Ben Simmons is actually good
You mean Ben Simmons with shooting? Haha.
Ben Simmons hit him right in the arm. The replay showed it perfectly
Ben Simmons dries his dick before his face.
Ben Simmons sings happy birthday to himself while washing his hands
Ben Simmons is great- doesn‚Äôt need a shot to make points. Embid is a train. Dominant center. And the shooters they have around them are really complementary. Well coached by Doc! Let‚Äôs have a good game Philly fans!
Ben Simmons in shambles
"That Ben Simmons putback with Embiid, Gasol, and Lebron next to him felt real ‚Äúthe future is now old man‚Äù"
Ben Simmons has the worst defense on Lebron I've ever seen.
Man first embiid nos Simmons passes out of a Caruso post up. It's like Caruso is prime Ben Wallace out on the block lol
Well I mean Ben Simmons did get hurt
What exactly does ben simmons do here
Ben Simmons is literally an Australian Draymond Green
Ben Simmons and not shooting while he's wide open?
Man Embiid may be big dicking us but atleast I can laugh at Ben Simmons getting cooked at literally the only thing he‚Äôs good at
Ben Simmons gonna hit a 3 this game
Too bad Ben Simmons don‚Äôt play like this every night
Ben Simmons attacking?
Ben Simmons is going to drive...  Just saying
Ben Simmons cooking James.   James cooking people too
Ben Simmons already reached his season average fga
"Dude. Fucking KAT, Ben Simmons and Trae Young are considered top 25, the Admiral would be top 10 for sure."
I have Ben Simmons for return ROTY. He‚Äôs been so good this year. üòè
"I mean between Wiseman, Melo and that Ben Simmons kid, competition is pretty stacked."
"They should be better too. Lost players to COVID in almost all the loses and second option Ben Simmons had been terrible on offense too, so it balances it out."
"Damn, those are Ben Simmons numbers."
"Honestly Chicago Bulls. This team lacks of primary playmaker and also Ben should play point forward he can defend all 5 positions can switch to everybody. Chicago Bulls starting 5 is full of shooting specialists.   He can play 4 with Markkanen at the 5 and can cover Markkanen's lack of post defending and also he can play point guard for them and they can let White to be microwave scorer.  Garrett Temple, Zach Lavine, Patrick Williams/Otto Porter Jr, Ben Simmons, Lauri Markkanen five is balanced can be effective on both sides."
Most overrated: Trae Young and Ben Simmons coming off wins   Most underrated: Trae Young and Ben Simmons coming off losses
So Trae is only a slightly worse defender than Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons being one of the 10 worst defenders in the league calls all of this into question
This is just as disrespectful as the entire laker team leaving the perimeter open for Ben Simmons to purposely take a 3 knowing damn well he's gonna brick it.
"The Ben Simmons comparison goalpost moves back every season. We‚Äôve gone from comparable to Luka and Tatum, to arguably better than Colin Sexton."
Shit like this is why Ben Simmons doesn't take shots. One of the greatest inside threat guards of all time shoots 3-5% worse than average and it's *awful*. If he didn't shoot at all y'all would be clowning him for that.
Especially since Ben Simmons is on the table waiting lol.
Ben Simmons : *exists*  reddit :  ‡≤†‚ï≠‚ïÆ‡≤†
"You reading this, Ben Simmons?"
Wtf is this thread lmao.   This community of all places is shitting on a guy who works for the team getting excited over good defense on the best player in the world? Against a player that has a lot of history with the franchise no less.   The same community that will create low light videos for players who have bad nights. The same community that will jerk off on their laptop when they see a new ben simmons airball video.   Fuck out of here clowning on someone that decided to show some emotion.
Zion really does have a Ben Simmons type shot profile when it comes to taking shots outside of 10 feet. Which tbh is what SVG wanted and which while a little extreme I‚Äôm generally fine with the idea of telling him to ditch most of those jumpers as of right now
Why on gods green earth would the Sixers trade Ben Simmons to Boston
"I've been thinking about a trade to washington, he doesn't fit with westbrook but we'll probably be looking to get off of him on his last year anyway, the Wizards can build a team specifically around Simmons from the ground up, we're not really married to any player if Ben comes here on a Beal trade"
"Idk. The rockets aren't really in a position to put a competitive team around Simmons. Idk how many picks/Swaps that was offered with him, but if you add simons to the current rockets they are not a competitor or close to it.  Wall  Simmons  Gordon/House  Tucker/Tate  Wood/Boogie  That lineup is rough. They seriously lack spacing and would have a Max and Supermax spot locked up for the next two years since I doubt anyone else wants to pay wall 41 million. Throw in Eric Gordon's contract and that is almost another 20 million locked up for I think 3 more years. During that time it would be hard to attract free agents, but we would be a back end of lottery or playoff team not able to add talent consistently through the draft.  I think I would rather have cap flexibility and a bunch of picks moving forward than Ben Simmons a guy that needs a very particular team around him to be his best, a team that we couldnt provide for at least two years."
"For Sixers fans wanting Beal, you‚Äôd have to find a team interested in Ben that has attractive near-term picks. Someone like Chicago, Minnesota or Charlotte. It would look something like this:  PHI receives: Beal  X team receives: Simmons  WAS receives: X team 2021 FRP, 2023+2025 FR swaps, PHL 2023+2027 FRP and FR swaps in 2024+2026, salary filler.  That‚Äôs 3 quality FRPs and 4 quality swaps for Beal, which I think gets it done."
Why and how tf would we trade Lavine for Ben Simmons?

"How is it that someone so phenomenonally gifted and talented like Ben Simmons can shoot so poorly? I'm honestly baffled. He will probably end up as one of the biggest ""What ifs"" I've seen when all is said and done."
‚ÄúYou did this.‚Äù - Ben Simmons
"I just wanted to specifically point out the backboard steal he had near the end of the game.  The ball gets tipped away from Danny Green in the corner.  Ben is standing in the middle of our lane and immediately notices the possession is about to switch and the Pistons are going into a fast break.  He leaves his man and sprints down the court, catching up to the ball, and **purposely** slaps the shot off the backboard, knowing that Kork is just behind him to gather the ricochet.  It's one of the quickest, most high-IQ plays you'll ever see, and Ben does stuff like this **all the time.**  *This* is why he's an all-star.  *This* is why you don't trade him.  He is the engine that runs this team, and if you can't see past his lack of an outside shot, you simply aren't paying enough attention or you don't know enough about the subtleties of basketball.  Ben Simmons haters, please shut up or learn more about basketball.    Or both.  Both would be great."
"He‚Äôs been fantastic in limited minutes. The first person in Embiids career who can somewhat hold down the fort when he sits.   The Dwight/Simmons minutes look brutal (as expected) but when he runs the floor with Shake Milton there seems to be a ton of chemistry.   In an ideal scenario, he‚Äôd play about 16 MPG with Shake when Embiid and Ben take their rests   His motor for offensive rebounds and his rim protection have been awesome. The most surprising part is how he seems to be a huge locker room presence and is really committed to helping both Ben and Jo. He‚Äôs been a big part of our teams turnaround"
Ben Simmons is going to have so many back door cuts right to the rim if Joel can pass out of a double (haven‚Äôt seen much Sixers so not sure but I assume he can)
"It‚Äôs early in the season but Embiid looks to have taken a leap in terms of his jumpshot. He‚Äôs at 40% but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he settles in at around 36%.  The threat of the Embiid pop at 36% opens up so much for Ben he needs more aggression.  I‚Äôm not the happiest with his development as a fan of his, and I don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs offensively a typical 2nd option, the dynamic offball threat that Curry provides him can help make that 2nd option by committee.  Ben Simmons needs to capitalize at pressure that paint more. He‚Äôs 6‚Äô10 and the opposing teams rim protector cannot be in optimal position to contest him at the rim all game.  With the weapons this Philly team has he could be getting 18-20ppg in there. He acts like he can‚Äôt finish or something."
Prob a better shooter than ben Simmons
Him and RJ gonna set up a private clubhouse with salt around it to ward off Ben Simmons.
it does for Ben simmons
He‚Äôs gonna be checking under his bed for Ben Simmons for a while.
"I see a Ben Simmons thread, i downvote  Dude isn‚Äôt worth discussing and has **zero power** and Devin Booker cucked him"
"You're not crazy, but it's not as ideal as you think. The dynamic between Ayton/Ben would be very similar to Embiid/Simmons."
"embiid i was fine with what he said.  doc? dude is a clown. two weeks prior when he was asked if he'd take simmons out for missing free throws he berated the media, then the next game he took ben out against the wizards. it fucked ben's confidence from the line. if he would have just told ben ""you gotta make free throws or we're not beating the fucking wizards. go do it"" i believe it would have done wonders. but he took him out rather than letting him work through it. huge misstep.  fuck doc rivers anyway. he's such a meh coach. doc has no room to go and criticize players or act like he wasn't the #2 reason why we lost that series. he lost the sixers game 1 having danny green guard trae. threw that shit away."
I‚Äôd assume this is referring to post game comments made by Rivers and Embiid. Rivers said he wasn‚Äôt sure if Simmons was a championship level point guard and Embiid said that the momentum in the final game against the Hawks shifted when Ben passed up a dunk.
Why would the 76ers care where Ben Simmons wants to play? He‚Äôs under contract until 2025. He shouldn‚Äôt have any leverage on picking a destination.
Ben Simmons is doing Philly pretty dirty by letting this come out and decreasing his trade value.
"34 years old Damian Lillard.   Lamelo LaFrance Ball, assuming Hornets don't find the success they envisioned.  Or any PG from Klutch (Ben Simmons, Trae Young, Darius Garland)  I'm just thinking of PGs for AD, hoping he stays."
"I‚Äôm still high on Ben Simmons. I think he needs the right situation paired with a sports psychologist. He could benefit being on a team that isn‚Äôt trying to contend. He‚Äôd have less pressure and a couple years to work on his game and mindset. I was thinking the other day how Kobe in his last few seasons would have been an excellent mentor to him.    I am lower than most on Jalen Green, luckily for him he‚Äôs got time to prove me wrong."
And that's how you burn a bridge effectively.  Ben Simmons has done nothing but do his own thing and expect to get what he wants when he hasn't earned anything.  GSW definitely doesn't need to do this trade.  Theyre fine where they are so let Morey try to keep looking for that Harden-esque return that hes not going to get.
"Nets should trade Kevin Durant for Ben Simmons. It'll be a great trade for the Nets, but a bad trade for the Sixers."
"Doc had to lie to keep the season afloat, look at Simmons bow lol. You can't be a new coach and then come in dropping hammers. If Ben is MIA now he would have acted the same way if Doc didn't lie but the problem is Simmons always looks good during the season and ass in the playoffs"
"Yeah. But Simmons and Dray can punish you if you give them space (so long as Simmons doesn't have the yips) and shooter X hits down open jumpers.   A non-yippy Ben is a guy who scores with reasonable volume at above average efficiency. He's very good attacking closeouts to get to the rim, and he'll find an open guy if you double someone. He's almost Dray-level at finding the right pass against a scrambling defense, better than Dray at finishing at the rim, and a monster in transition.    Fuck. I'm talking myself into this.   Of course, none of it works if Ben is going to pass up open layups.   If the price is something like Wiggins+Kuminga, you've got to at least think about it.   If the price is Wiggins+Wiseman+Kuminga+Moody, you tell Philly to fuck off."
Dude fuck Ben Simmons honestly.  76ers should 100% give him shit because he's too immature and prideful to be held accountable for his terrible performance.  I honestly wouldn't want this man anywhere near my team.
"Every possession is 2x free throws. And you rotate players. Kind of like penalty shootout in soccer, except 2x FT.   For 48 minutes.  Ben Simmons would retire and become a mason."
That seals it: Ben Simmons to the LA Galaxy
"And the option, while being a pretty bad shooter, it still a better shooter than Ben Simmons."
Ben Simmons would be worth an All-Star and 4 picks then
"He'd probably get a lot of playtime on the Sixers, unless Maxey takes a big leap. We're in dire need of a PG, regardless of what happens to Ben.    Schroder isn't an amazing playmaker but he's still much better than everyone else currently on the team (except Simmons.)   If he's stuck with taking a minimum, we're probably his best bet for a playoff team. He'll get plenty of minutes, Doc will make sure of that."
"Baahahahahaaaahhahahhhahahaa WTF would GS want with Ben Simmons, this guy is worse in the off-season than he is during the post season and that‚Äôs saying something."
"I apologise in advance if I have offended your star player. I understand that as a Jazz fan, you might rate him highly compared to other centers.   However, you‚Äôre paying him 40m per year. The only player a team is paying that amount that is a shelf of his old self is John Wall. Most max players, other than Ben Simmons, are able to do everything such as shooting and create for other players.   To win a game, a team has to score the MOST points. Even Ben Simmons was rebuked for his underwhelming performance this post season even with his great defence accolades in the regular season. If you look at Gobert‚Äôs stats, his free throw percentage is below the leagues average.   For the price you‚Äôre paying, as a Jazz fan, do you think you‚Äôre utilising the cap space by paying so much? With confidence, can you say he‚Äôs worth every penny?   If you read properly, I said that Curry and Booker. I also said that he cannot guard well outside the paint. I never said he wasn‚Äôt the best or considered the best. I like how you selectively take out my points and have this narrow approach.   We can trade our views back and forth, but do you actually believe you can win with Gobert on your team when the Western Conference is already so stacked? If you read the post correctly, it says is he worthy of a HOF, which I said ‚Äúdefinitely‚Äù and he‚Äôs one of the best defensive player. Like any team sport, there‚Äôs no such thing as the ‚ÄúBEST‚Äù player only ‚ÄúONE‚Äù of the best."
We won a a super bowl cause of the wentz pick and Ben Simmons has made at least 3 allstars
"Wiggins, Wiseman, Kuminga and a few picks or swaps would be more valuable than Ben, Maxey, one of Thybulle or Shake and the picks.   In your scenario it makes zero sense that the Warriors get rid of so much just to help the 6ers get the better of the two players, trading one of their better scorers/perimeter defenders, two promising young players for literally only Simmons, someone who doesn‚Äôt necessarily even fit in their system or roster."
"It would be bad playing Simmons and Draymond together. Ben also can‚Äôt play C, so I don‚Äôt see the point."
"100% easy decision. Ben Simmons' personality and locker room presence leaves a lot to be desired. Draymond can be a lot to handle, but no one can ever question his competitiveness or willingness to sacrifice for the team. Polar opposites in that respect."
Ben Simmons wants out? Thats weak. Did Philly hurt his feelings?
Ben Simmons should just retire and then wait a year to get back in then he can sign with anyone
Begone Ben Simmons apologist
Ben Simmons
"""San Antonio is sending Dejounte Murray, Keldon Johnson, Devin Vassell, and the 2022+2024 1st round picks to Philadelphia for Ben Simmons"""
&gt;they still tried their hardest and put in some fantastic effort  Unlike Ben Simmons
"I think Ben Simmons needs to be in the Draymond role to thrive. And very few teams really have the roster of shooters, and none of them have the cap space to make it work.  I get why Morey is trying everything to make sure he's not selling 20 cents on the dollar, but he'll be lucky to get 70 cents on the dollar. There just aren't enough real buyers for Simmons."
Toronto Raptors acquire Ben Simmons
"Nah, plenty of people been arguing that Simmons/Embiid couldn't work in principle, calling out Ben for not working on his offense or a real post game if he wasn't going to learn to shoot. Can't act like the whole world was surprised Simmons flamed out."
"Thompson, Curry or Green gets injured. Need to see all of these three play at least once this season.   Or better yet still, Ben Simmons gets traded to the Warriors for 4 frp, Wiggins and Wiseman. That‚Äôs the worst move ever. That‚Äôs like having 2 Draymonds but a worst version of Draymond who can‚Äôt shoot threes."
Simmons isn't a point guard. He doesn't do any point guard. He doesn't run pick and roll and when he does he it's bad. He doesnt playmake in the half-court. He's doesnt create when the offence breaks down. Put's zero pressure on the defence. Philly's bench units are total disasters exactly because they don't have a point guard or anyone that can create offence when Embiid sits.  Bringing the ball up and standing in the dunker's spot doesnt make him a point guard. The Warriors have a better Ben Simmons already. What would Simmons even do on offence for the Warriors? Stand around so Steph can get quadruple teamed?
"Draymond still hits free throws, dunks and layups.  Ben wasn't even TRYING them for fear of getting fouled.  Even post shoulder injury, messed up lousy % Draymond is more valuable on offense than the Ben Simmons from the Atlanta series.  If I had any faith at all that the version of Ben we saw then was an aberration then I'd feel very differently about this whole thing.  But it really feels like he has been pointing in this direction since college.  With no indication that he is willing to do anything necessary to make any real changes."
"I am lower on Luka than literally everyone else. He‚Äôs going to be great maybe already is great but I can‚Äôt stand watching him play. He isn‚Äôt athletic and his defense is average. I just can‚Äôt see him being the best player on a championship team. Especially on the mavs.  I rank Ben Simmons higher than most people. Just because he doesn‚Äôt have a jump shot doesn‚Äôt take away from the fact that he‚Äôs amazing on defense and one of if not the best fast real players in the game. Smart basketball player and really fun to watch.   (Don‚Äôt murder me for my take on luka, I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs bad, im not saying he isn‚Äôt an MVP in the future, just saying he isn‚Äôt the second coming of Jesus Christ on the basketball court)"
Dray + Simmons= bad. The Warriors already have a better Ben Simmons.
Why are comparing Ben Simmons to Aaron Rodgers? He‚Äôs not on that level and isn‚Äôt about to retire one of the greats.   He‚Äôs more similar to mid career Jay Cutler.
"The warriors have traded Wiggins, moody, kuminga and picks for ben simmons.  He's a good player but not a fit with dray on the court. We need wings who can shoot. I don't mind any other star but would prefer to have good 2 way wings like pg, og, Middleton."
Didn‚Äôt Ben Simmons put KAT in a headlock one game?
"This was Embiid's statement when asked about that: ""Friendship ended with Ben Simmons. Now Drummond is my bestfriend."""
Are you Ben Simmons?
"Ben Simmons is a loser, but blaming Brown/the front office for not trading Simmons two summers ago is hindsight bias and revisionist history wrapped into one. I don‚Äôt remember a single peep out of Sixers fans wanting to deal Simmons over Jimmy. They would have burned down the arena if the front office had chosen Jimmy over what they considered one of the two crown jewels of the Process."
"The first sentence is literally ‚ÄúThis is why Ben Simmons is a loser‚Äù. Idc I‚Äôll take the downvotes for pointing out the way this sub and people in general talk about athletes when their at their lowest is despicable, I‚Äôve seen comments calling him a loser and a spoiled brat, like you guys don‚Äôt even know him."
Yeah I think the recent events are what‚Äôs making every say ‚ÄúWiggins &gt; Simmons!‚Äù On that team. I mean Ben would be shooting just as much as Bogut did and he shared the floor with draymond as well.
"A couple years back there was a 300 3 pointer challenge (maybe it was 500? Idk). People posted on this sub, videos of them shooting for hours in a time lapse. There are a good number of people here that are amazing shooters, who would without a doubt beat Ben Simmons. I can tell you‚Äôre new here."
It‚Äôs crazy how people think Lillard is some superstar that will push you over the edge. I‚Äôd rather ride it out with Embiid and Simmons by actually getting them some help. The problem isn‚Äôt Ben or Joel it‚Äôs the fact that the rest roster is trash
"What, Am I drugs or are you? You‚Äôre telling me the 76ers should keep Ben Simmons instead of trading for Dame Lillard straight up?"
"Any negative news about Ben Simmons will be taken as truth on this sub, he‚Äôs on a level of hate I‚Äôve rarely see and it has been steady; most players people have a love-hate wave relationship but this fucking guy has been hated from the get go lmao."
"I feel like the whole notion of ""being thrown under the bus"" has been lost.  Being thrown under the bus isn't what happens when you screw up publicly and everybody is aware your screwed up and your teammates say, ""Yeah, he screwed up and it hurt us.""  Being thrown under the bus is when people call attention to your mistakes that might have otherwise gone unnoticed as an excuse to hide their own mistakes.  Nobody threw Ben Simmons under the bus - people just talked honestly about his failures. If he wants to be petty and upset because people didn't pretend his obvious fuck-ups were something other than the obvious fuck-ups that they were, that's him being fragile."
"That actually makes Ben Simmons look worse. 3pa are directly related to opportunity for role players like Curry and Green who generally shoot off the catch and shoot. If they aren't getting their 3pa high, that means their playmaker (Simmons) is not doing a good job creating open shots for them. Out of the 3, only Harris is good at creating his own shot."
Ben Simmons is leagues better than both of those guys. What is this weird comparison?
"Yes lol and besides like what does holding Ben Simmons accountable even look like? You can't fire him, should he be flogged at center court or something? Tuff guy is the perfect way to describe these people"
"No, I'm saying over an entire year he inflated Ben's importance and impact while not seeming to address any of the issues at hand, then when those issues affected the team he blamed Ben publicly. This isn't the first time he spoke negatively about his players in public, this isn't the first time his teams have fallen apart in the playoffs when they have more talent, and it isn't the first time his teams have had a divided locker room. I'm not blaming everything on him, I just think that on top of Ben not having done his job, Doc deserves some blame. The pendulum has shifted waaay too far over to Ben Simmons because he's not really that likeable of a guy to the public. It's clear there's some mental issues going on with him, but nobody cares cause they don't like him. He's the easy scapegoat."
"Higher on Ben Simmons than consensus:   Once he gets out of Philly, and possibly moved to a forward spot I think he will be great. People get caught up in the circle jerk and just wanna pile on. He had a bad playoff series, yes he was very much in his head - but who put him there? People wanna talk about he's a coward for not shooting 3s, when he's watched Philly fans shitting on Embiid for shooting 3s for years and he knows he's a worse shooter. Watched them turn on Markelle. Make-a-Wish kid treatment fake cheering if he attempts a three doesn't help.  Maybe he should be ""mentally tougher"" and because he's making 170m he shouldn't have feelings. Or maybe Philly fans just suck. They aren't ride or die, they are ""what have you done for me lately"".   Lower: Aaron Gordon -   played well with a full Denver team, but I think his desire to demonstrate he's a star with send him back down the road of taking dumbass fadeaways and pullup 3s. We already started to see that when Murray went down, and I'm v sure AG is going into next season thinking he can make an All-Star bid, and taking the shots he thinks will get him there."
"\&gt; High- Ben Simmons... lots of haters..... he is being used improperly, has been his whole NBA career. Even with such bad fits, he still managed to up his defense to all NBA level  No one doubts his defensive ability. The context you've provided hardly makes sense though. He'd be at an all-nba level defensive end regardless of 'fit'.  Usually, when people refer to a bad fit and Simmons, they are talking about the offensive end of the floor.  The 'used improperly' and 'bad fit' argument that gets thrown around is for the most part bullshit. Simmons has demonstrated he doesn't like to play off ball and wants to be the primary handler. Simmons had three 40% or better (okay Harris was 39%) 3 pt shooters around him on top of one of the most dominant centers in the game who shoots respectively himself.  People claim he'd suddenly be great primarily playing in the front court if he had another great playmaker.  Could he benefit from a great playmaker? Sure, any player would. However, this argument totally neglects the fact that so many different strategies have been tried over the years.  There are a lot of possessions where he doesn't even take it up the court (in fact, this was evident in the playoffs) and despite receiving respectable passes and opportunities to do something off-ball, he completely squashes the opportunity. He hasn't shown being able to effectively play off-ball at all at this point regardless of the types of looks/passes he's getting. He sits around in the dunker spot and hasn't even done that effectively.  He doesn't have a post-game, can't exploit getting to the line because he can't make free throws, and is very passive in general even when he has opportunities to lay it up or go for a dunk. Top that off with the fact he can't shoot in general, it's hilarious people think he'd magically be outstanding at the 4/5.  Simmons has brought this on himself. Could he turn it around? Absolutely, but fuck this he hasn't been given an opportunity up until now nonsense. Even if James Harden was on the team passing to him it wouldn't suddenly make up for his weaknesses offensively."
"Other fans are morons then, they do not want what's best for us, they are just saying that but want us to trade for Ben Simmons"
What is fox exactly? All star? Great shooter? Elite defender? At least ben simmons is elite in something and the fit would be better with what the kings have
Dude of course we take Simmons. Ben Simmons fills a Draymond role for us. I'd rather have Simmons at the 4 as a playmaker and dynamic defender and take our chances on finding a decent wing.
"This is the second guy to report this, and if you've followed the Sixers/Ben, this isn't surprising. Ben has never followed any of the Sixers offseason/development plan for him.   An example:  &gt;Two days after that 2018 loss to the Celtics, the Sixers held exit meetings in their Camden, New Jersey, training facility. Each player was given a four-page document containing individualized offseason plans. For Simmons, the list of priorities included free-throw shooting, finishing at the rim and developing a jump shot. In that order.   &gt;After the meetings, Brown told reporters during a news conference that he expected Simmons to spend ""intense time"" with Townsend in the offseason. Everyone around the team was excited. They felt like a breakthrough had occurred, that Simmons was ready not only to solidify his improvements at the line but also to begin carrying those changes into his shooting overall.   &gt;After exit meetings, the players and coaches went their separate ways to recharge. Some time passed, and according to multiple league sources, when Townsend returned to the team‚Äôs facility, Brown pulled him aside. Change of plans, he said.  &gt;Simmons‚Äô agent, Rich Paul, and family had decided that he‚Äôd be better off working with one of his brothers, Liam, a former low-level Division I guard and assistant coach, who now coaches at Division II Colorado Christian University."
Ben Simmons is still a very very good basketball player. I really hate how circle jerky NBA fan analysis gets.
Obviously you look at it in the context of his career/potential. No one would actually say Ben Simmons is a legitimate loser in life. Come on man lol
The Warriors were already a top 5 defense last season‚Ä¶.How would Ben Simmons contribute in a halfcourt playoff setting for Golden State? is the real question
"Personally I believe it can work. But that's not a popular opinion. I am also looking at it in a long run vs winning a championship this upcoming season. I don't think with Wiggins or with Simmons we could take on the likes of the Nets or Bucks straight up. But if we develop our rooks, let Ben grow into Drays role and let steph steph, we are going to be better. Draymond has maybe two more years before he's a net negative. He is slowing down and the only thing keeping him where he is, is his BBIQ. Steph's skills will age well and Simmons can run point which will take pressure off Steph later in his career."
Y‚Äôall? I‚Äôm not a sixers fan and Ben Simmons can ball out for the sharks my guy
"i mean, i just don‚Äôt think he threw anyone under the bus. if anything, Ben Simmons threw his entire team under the bus with his performance and his own press conferences. no one is talking about those. i‚Äôm all for Doc ‚Äúthrowing him under the bus‚Äù if he‚Äôs speaking the actual truth."
"With all due respect, I don't see how anyone can be low on Damian. He's over-performed constantly. The only reason Portland is ever at the stages they're even at is because of him.  He has legitimately had a terrible supporting cast his entire career.  With the same sue respect, I don't understand the affinity for Simmons. Aside from his defense, he hasn't improved whatsoever throughout his career. When people think basketball, they think shooting a ball into a hoop, or dunking. Ben can't shoot and was too afraid to dunk - the guy can't do the most fundamental aspect of his job.  I think he has potential but definitely not in Philadelphia."
Jokic lebron luka trae harden/cp3 then after that you can slot ben simmons and russ
Ben Simmons has *been* a thin skinned bitch lmaooo
Ben Simmons and Brandon Ingram
"High- Ben Simmons... lots of haters..... he is being used improperly, has been his whole NBA career.  Even with such bad fits, he still managed to up his defense to all NBA level, and I believe has a tremendous upside when his offense starts clicking.  Low on- LeBron James:  all the potential in the world... then he opens his mouth and takes to social media and throws it all away in my eyes."
Haha fuck Ben Simmons haha
"Very very high on Ben Simmons. Very very low on Damian Lillard. Don‚Äôt think we should be giving Portland ben just for Dame but if we must, so be it"
"the fans in Philly were volunteering to pick up Ben Simmons and drop him off at home. i‚Äôve seen Philly fans boo other players for less. he‚Äôs a massive letdown, and he‚Äôs acting like a child. makes sense."
"Ben Simmons hasn‚Äôt made one improvement to his game since he was drafted, stunk the place up, and now wants to play for a warriors team looking to push for another title. Enjoy Minneapolis Ben."
"No, he said Morey was trying to trade him on draft day, not that he was definitely going to be traded that night. He was pretty clear Morey was still asking for ridiculous stuff as well which means Ben Simmons is staying put until Morey concedes or another team does"
"No, he said Morey was trying to trade him on draft day, not that he was definitely going to be traded that night. He was pretty clear Morey was still asking for ridiculous stuff as well which means Ben Simmons is staying put until Morey concedes or another team does"
" No, he said Morey was trying to trade him on draft day, not that he was definitely going to be traded that night. He was pretty clear Morey was still asking for ridiculous stuff as well which means Ben Simmons is staying put until Morey concedes or another team does"
"NBA players are soft these days, my god. poor Ben Simmons, can‚Äôt make 40% free throws as a point guard and all star."
‚Äúsixers are better of getting a shooting coach at this point‚Äù   Do they have any idea how many years it would take for Simmons to develop a shot? they really about to make Embiid waste more of his prime waiting for Ben
"Ben Simmons has a net worth around $75M or so.  I'd call that pretty substantial ""leverage"" and if he's decided he doesn't want to play for the Sixers, that ship may have sailed.   The Sixers may have to accept that if they want any value at all from Simmons, they're going to have to accept $.60 on the dollar, give or take."
"Ben ""Jack Eichel"" Simmons"
"Yeah, because Ben ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too scared to dunk over a hobbit Trae Young‚Äù Simmons is in the same tier as Hakeem Olajuwon."
"Boo fucking hoo.   A millionaire basketball ‚Äústar‚Äù player cannot get the criticism without people saying this stuff. Doc and Embiid ‚ÄúHUMILIATED/SHAMED/ABUSED‚Äù Ben Simmons. All Embiid said was that after a certain play (the missed dunk), the game went away from them.   Because again: who the hell is 6‚Äô11‚Äù and passes up a dunk when wide open? And this dunk would have tied game 7?!?"
"If I'm GSW, I just can't justify having Draymond and Ben Simmons. I think Ben is still pretty good, in the tier below All-Star, but he doesn't really fit into today's NBA as anything other than a ""multi-tool"" type of player.  I just don't see any teams where he's a great fit."
"Ok, you need more shooting. How about *2021-22* Ben Simmons though? He‚Äôs been posting pics on IG of him in the gym with emojis as the caption"
"&gt;Sure and working on it isn't guaranteed to improve anything  yeah lmao OK. He can spend basically his entire life getting his skills to the point of making the league but he cant do this? Despite worse shooters and worse players getting it done?      So the improvement from 56% FT shooting during his rookie season to 60% FT shooting in season 2 is just a pure fluke? No work went into that?    Can you explain the drop to 35% (?!??!?!?) in this years playoffs? just more flukey stuff? It was not possible for him to keep it at 60%?  &amp;#x200B;  FOH lol, Ben Simmons did not give a fuck about his shooting and now is crying that his team is calling him out. Who knows ""maybe"" they tried to tell him in private? What else they supposed to do? Pay this man max money, lose in the 2nd round every year, and watch Embiid walk?"
"Ah yes Ben Simmons, famously not accountable for his extremely public and much reviled underperformance"
Ben Simmons acting like he didn't just put up one of the most sorry performances in a playoff series smh
wdym tank? lillard is a tax payers MLE player at best.  shameful he made it onto team USA instead of beasts like dual citizen ben simmons.
"Embiid being upset and saying what he said was fine. I think if I were him being upset was understandable. It's probably been building for years. Doc should know better just from a team standpoint, and trade asset standpoint. Also, Doc lied about Ben Simmons all year instead of actually dealing with the issues (though maybe he did behind the scenes). Just rubs me the wrong way that Doc is a professed players coach, and he lobbies all year for his players to win awards, then as soon as he under-performs as a coach he is pretty quick to blame his players. Also, for being such a good players coach, his locker rooms have often been a mess. I'm just of the opinion that a good coach doesn't publicly blame a player unless there is some sort of dispute or disrespect going on. ESPECIALLY when you been gassin him up all year."
I hope Philly fans are ready for another season with the same Ben Simmons because he isn‚Äôt going anywhere for Morey‚Äôs asking price.  Gotta wonder if they start the season 5-8 and Ben is shooting 2 for 10 if they risk Embiid asking for a trade instead.  It‚Äôs time for Morey to get real.
This guy has just been wishfully thinking for months now that Ben gets traded to gsw. Tho why would any logical person in the golden state front office be ok with it as it would mean either losing klay or wiggins plus the draft picks. Even wiggins is at this point a much better asset than ben simmons. Logically the only way this could be a possibility is a trade that would include draymond green as he is a similar liability to stretch the floor (you can‚Äôt have green and simmons in the same team and expect to score) and gsw wouldn‚Äôt be ok with losing green because of his strategic importance for the gsw culture. So this man makes zero sense.
"This is why Ben Simmons is a loser.  Joel Embiid is at the Sixers working out, getting in shape, and improving his game, while greeting the new free agents and rookies.  Jimmy Butler, who Simmons and his daddy Brett Brown ran out of town, has spent the summer recruiting to build up his organization.   It is insane that Brett Brown and the Colangelo influenced front office sat there 2 summers ago and decided to build around Ben Simmons instead of Joel Embiid/Jimmy."
This. I do not fucking want Ben Simmons
"No, he said Morey was trying to trade him on draft day, not that he was going to be traded. He was pretty clear Morey was still asking for ridiculous stuff as well which means Ben Simmons getting traded is unlikely."
"GSW is so stacked.  People are so against ""super teams,"" but honestly, ""Why wouldn't you want to play for one?""  You wouldn't want to be on a team with Steph, Klay, Draymond, and, potentially, Ben Simmons, led by a HoF coach who formerly played with Michael Jordan?"
Ben can‚Äôt play center and no amount of shooting greatness will make up for how defenses will disregard Dray/Simmons‚Ä¶unless their 5th is somehow another 40%+ high volume shooter
"I think we could finish better than the hawks and Knicks for sure?? And as for the 76ers, who knows what they‚Äôll look like with the whole Ben Simmons situation?"
I'm truly not sure if there's ever been a more frustrating player in NBA history than Ben Simmons.
Ben Simmons omg unbelievable
Ugh look at Ben Simmons actively finding ways to lose this game. No winning basketball from him.
Wait Ben Simmons is unplayable in the fourth tho
Ben Simmons defense in the last five minutes is pretty close to a cheat code. The closeouts are ridiculous. The steals.   Will never understand why he can't drive like that to the hole all game.
ben simmons with the 4th quarter stat pad
Ben Simmons is a black hole on offense in the half court. It‚Äôs hard to watch
Can a Philly fan explain to me what‚Äôs going on with Ben Simmons?
"Yeah, but the Sixers don't have Ben Simmons either so its fair"
"Hey, that's Rookie of the Year and third team All-NBA Ben Simmons to you"
Ben Simmons why are you not Jaylen Brown
Ben Simmons is the most overrated player in the NBA. Can‚Äôt shoot but also has no willingness to attack the basket.
"Hot take: I would love the Celtics to get involved in the Simmons sweepstakes if he‚Äôs available.   Highly doubt Philly trades with us but he‚Äôd be the perfect 3rd star in Boston.   Our PGs have been hunted since the IT days, and we don‚Äôt need another BIG scorer, we just need a guy that can move the ball, rebound, and play D. Ben can do all this and still average like 15ppg.   That would complete the ‚Äúevery player can switch onto every other player‚Äù defensive scheme that the Celtics seem to be running with a 5‚Äô11‚Äù 175 lb Kemba"
I had to do a double take. I thought this said Ben Simmons.
The duality of Ben Simmons
Man the game thread/team records/schedule bot fucking sucks    But who am I to complain since this is all free and we're privileged to live in a society where we can hang out and watch basketball games for fun    Ben Simmons breaks out tonight with 33/11/7
"Ingram easily has the most potential in that draft he's already better than Ben. Brown is starting to catch up averaging 25 pts rn. Murray is getting there too. Simmons has yet to improve on anything, but defense. Ingram leaped from 16 ppg to 25 ppg scorer in 4 season he started off as 29% from 3 as rookie now he's at around 38%"
"Doc Rivers is low key using Ben Simmons like a Rajon Rondo who can set screens.  Ben so far this year is averaging 12.2 points per game on 8 shots attempts a game while also getting about 8 assists a game. In the 2008-09 season Rajon had 11.9 points a game and 8.2 asts, only shooting instead of passing 9 times a game.  This is the first season that Ben has not averaged above ten shots attempts a game and I really do not think it is a coincidence that this is happening under the new coach Doc Rivers."
"This team wins 69 games minimum, they literally have a high quality player at every position. And they also have 2 dpoy lvl defenders on there team along with 2 fringe all defensive players in jb and grant. Plus the playmaking of ben Simmons, shit 70+ wins wouldn't be unreasonable."
Sixers fans are underratedly bad. Their players don't even like the fans. Worst fans/organization/ben simmons a role player
That team would be much better if you just benched Ben Simmons for Chris Boucher
Imagine passing up on Ben Simmons because of Russell Westbrook. Westbrook would be shipped out of DC ASAP if Simmons was coming into town.
Ben simmons should just not play point guard
"What does ben simmons even have to do with this lineup. You could put cj there and they would probably still contend they have good defense with turner, grant and brown and a great defense. This is more of a what if we have lillard with some players that can actually defend situation more than a ben simmons role as Draymond"
"Problem isn't how good he is right now. It's the fact that he basically looks capped out as a player potential wise. By age 25, most players stop making significant leaps. They are who they are by that point. Simmons turns 25 later this season and he has basically had 0 improvement offensively in 4 years.     This Simmons (who is still a very good player) is basically who you will be getting for the rest of his career most likely. A top 25 player, a solid All Star and elite defender who can't be the #1 or even #2 on a title winning team. That's what Ben Simmons is. It's a far cry from the generational player people thought he would be at LSU."
"I would‚Äôve thought a wolves wizards and 76ers trade would‚Äôve been discussed at the beginning of the season. Ben Simmons to the wolves, sixers and Beal, and wizards can kickstart their rebuild with the number one pick and hella draft compensation and young pieces. Still remember people calling that trade dumb but I still stand behind it being a win win scenario for everyone"
I‚Äôm super low on Ben Simmons but this team would be good. Dame is the only bad defender and you could just make Ben the center while miles Turner spots up
"What I meant was I respect Bens ability to get into the paint and handle himself through contact. People dumb as balls and dont understand thats the aspect I'm in awe of. Giannis has that same ability to finish strong and be athletic. I hate the 76ers and I hate Ben Simmons for being a liability as somebody that can't shoot the ball at all, even Shaq shot mid range and had to be marked there, but to denounce Bens basketball IQ is a travesty. Him being not able to shoot the jumper bc of whatever his left hand right hand issue is has nothing to do with IQ and ability.    Just like Lonzo. I've been a bit Lonzo fan for a long time because of his basketball IQ. He's smart and personally I love defense and transition creativity, which Lonzo finds himself being really good at. Dude sometimes looks like a modern day Dennis Rodman with his ability to create simply and his mindset of hounding for the ball and fishing for turnovers. I'm a defender at heart in soccer and ultimate Frisbee, having played with players that have gone pro that are semi pro played in D1 full ride d2 the entire spectrum of top ball in America and there's a difference in somebody who just knows to defend and somebody who just scores. You literally don't learn elite defense, you need to have been born with that mentality and an off beat timing to follow a play before it happens. As a defender in all sports, if you're on time you're late. I lost track of what I was talking about but defense is great great players see the game different. Comparing somebody like Kanter to any time Shaq is like comparing Thaddeus Young to younger Carmelo Anthony. Thaddeus decent player I like him but he's no Carmelo."
"Which Simmons has fallen more out of favor, Ben or Bill?"
These topics are such clever and refreshing ways to have the good old fashioned shit on Ben posts.   Anyway if the Sixers lost Simmons and added Beal they would not have a point guard anymore. It won't make them much better than they are right now. But the Wizards would be getting a player that fits their team even less and would be giving away a player that would fetch them more assets imo.   So Wizards lose this trade much more imo.
"Chauncey was not their best player. Ben Wallace was. But even if he were he only averaged 16.9, so you could make the same criticism about him as /u/JeffKaplanIsDaddy is making about Simmons."
"Because while Ben Simmons is a phenomenal basketball player he hasn‚Äôt made the type of improvements his peers have in the same span. Mitchell, Brown, Murray, Ingram, Siakam, Sabonis, Brogdon ect. I‚Äôm not saying those guys are better than him, but Simmons still has the same weaknesses he came in the league with meanwhile all those guys have been rounding out their games and making significant improvements. Simmons came in the league head and shoulders above everyone else and they‚Äôve caught up now. I think the thought of ABSOLUTELY HAVING to trade him was uncalled for, but understandable because after all ‚Äúif you‚Äôre not getting better, you‚Äôre getting worse‚Äù - Draymond Green (when they signed KD)"
"I don‚Äôt think wizards would want just Ben Simmons? The fit with Westbrook is horrible. Although Simmons is an elite defender, offensively he‚Äôs extremely limited particularly in the half court. I‚Äôm not sure the Wizards want to go from Beal, to a guy who isn‚Äôt gonna provide any elite offensive potential."
Sixers definitely. I don‚Äôt see Ben Simmons getting much better than what he is now
It‚Äôs weird they really don‚Äôt scare me or anyone else probably as a 1st seed. Ben Simmons while elite defensively has too many exploitable holes offensively and it will hurt them come playoff time
"please keep sleeping on us, i want people to stop talking about ben simmons all the time"
"I mean we are ~1/4 of a way through the season and #1 in the east with a handful of games where half our roster was out cause of covid and [Embiid + Simmons net rtg is the best it's been in their careers](https://i.redd.it/rs128zi0drc61.png) and that's with Ben in a huge slump.  Are you actually watching games or following the narrative?  Cause unacceptable isn't really the word I would use.  Again I'm not saying Ben has been great, he's clearly still bothered by his knee since his lateral movement has been inhibited but given all the facts and assuming he will return to form, I'm just not sure what you're trying to say"
"If Giannis ‚Äústagnates‚Äù at 2x MVP/DPOY and doesn‚Äôt regress, it‚Äôs obviously Ben Simmons. He‚Äôs a top pick who‚Äôs ceiling seems like borderline all star."
"Lol Ben Simmons is the most negatively talked about basketball player on this sub since like his second year, he will lose any comparison debate on this sub to any player. And now, after Mitchell has a good game and Simmons has been struggling since his return, this is the best time to ask that question? Lol.   Personally I think Ben is the better overall player but the Jazz need Mitchell's skillset way more than they need Mitchell's. Likewise the Sixers wouldn't need Mitchell nearly as much as they need Ben.   But seriously any player who can shoot is better than Ben in this sub. Idk why you're even asking this question. Ben would lose to Caruso. No one gives a shit on this sub about All Star games or the fact that he was selected to an ALL NBA team over Mitchell (both listed as guards) or any of that. Mitchell can shoot, doesn't matter how efficient he is or isn't in a given season, he can shoot Ben can't debate over."
"Feeling great. Roster cohesion is significantly improved from last year, and team chemistry also seems to be better. Our defense is still great and we actually have shooting now. Ben Simmons has been disappointing with his pack of improvement, but on the other hand Embiid is playing like an MVP. Morey and Rivers and making me feel like this team has a shoot at a title, perhaps an even better one than when Butler was here. Unfortunately the Celtics, Nets, and Bucks might have something to say about that."
Not sure why everyone loves Ben Simmons he is a dime a dozen.
And Giannis and Ben Simmons. Young prime Shaq was a mobile monster absolutely terrifying. Like you think this Zion kid is impressive driving to the paint then wow peak Shaq uh oh.  But also Shaq needs to chill haha. Chuck always does good although idk if that hurts or inflates Shaqs ego. But that joke had to be made.
"Ben Simmons, say what you want about giannis stagnation he‚Äôs a MVP level player with glaring issues but he still proven to be a top tier level. With Simmons he‚Äôs not on that level (although his defense is clearly 1st team) so his stagnation is more concerning"
"You just don't get it.  If Ben Simmons played another position, or maybe wasn't as good, or got sick that year, or had a horrible accident, he doesn't even get the selection."
"Ben Simmons is one of the  the mentally softest players in the League. Between the 2 giannis plays attacking well Simmons is constantly looking to give the ball away because he can‚Äôt shoot and he is afraid to go to the rim and get fouled.   Ben Simmons is a better defender then giannis. If you had to shut down a player one on one you would want Simmons guarding him both can guard 1-5. Giannis is just on a better defensive team.   Ben has regressed offensively. His points are down and in the half court set he is not very good most of his scoring comes on the break. He is looking like a career 16/8/8 guy but with his size, athleticism, and skill he is a major disappointment."
Whats up with all these Ben Simmons type ‚Äúi cant shoot but im athletic‚Äù guys? They‚Äôre ugly to watch and can‚Äôt do one of the main fundamentals of basketball
"Personally I think Ben Simmons has become underrated.  People shit on him constantly but he's still an All-NBA level defender and a great distributor.  He can't shoot, which is a problem - but is there any other weakness in his game?  He isn't an MVP level player, but he is still a really, really good player.  Saying Giannis has stagnated is insane.  If he has stagnated that means he's still at MVP level."
Ben Simmons looks more like a deluxe Andre Roberson with ball handling.
"Ben Simmons. Dude has been on the same game, since he started. He hasn't taken that next step imo"
You think Ben Simmons shooting form looks okay?  Ugh
"Ben Simmons, the mfer wont even attempt to shoot a ball"
Ben Simmons  Giannis is a back to back MVP and defending Defensive player of the year put respect on those achievements.  He need to be consistent in those areas but he gets better every year he is adding range.   Simmons just hit a point that he is no longer an all star just a good pointguard but very tall. He has potential to be so much more but in this league you have to be at least a menace if left alone from three. Clearly he is not. They leave him wide open.... he needs to start with that or he will be a slashing Foward and his trade value will keep droping.  Give me the Greek Freak all day!
Ben Simmons was third team all nba last year and Mitchell wasn‚Äôt so.. but this season Mitchell has been much better no discussion about it
Ben Simmons can pretty much guard 1 to 4.5 as well. Wouldn‚Äôt want him against huge dudes but don‚Äôt mind him going up against virtually anyone in the league.
"Haha, will Ben Simmons be our center I guess?"
Ben simmons defense got worse?  Lol you‚Äôre high
You know who‚Äôs really good at defense?  Ben Simmons.  Nets should trade somebody to get that guy.
Do you think Ben Simmons is capable of a 20/20/20 game?
Ben Simmons‚Äô literally only made 3rd team because he‚Äôs listed as a ‚Äúguard‚Äù if he was listed at forward like Lebron he doesn‚Äôt even get the selection
"That‚Äôs just objectively false. We hoped his scoring would progress - it hasn‚Äôt. But to act like the rest of his game hasn‚Äôt improved is ridiculous.   From an impact level, he‚Äôs improved unbelievably on the defensive end, while also playing more intelligently as an offball player (setting screens, back door cuts, etc).   Even with him recovering from injuries and struggling to start the year, I‚Äôll take current Ben Simmons 10 times out of 10 over rookie Ben"
Jokic or Ben Simmons
Yeah a Ben Simmons trade would've been awesome for you guys.
Didn't ESPN had this 'Ben Simmons is a jumper away from Lebron' take? Like cmon man that is some of the most abysmal shit i've heard
im gonna start calling any pass first defensive point guard bargain bin ben simmons
Lonzo Ball is a bargain bin Ben Simmons. Change my mind
Ben simmons
Lonzo playing like Ben Simmons
Wish Ben Simmons would do that even
"The correct answer is Ben Simmons. He would be the best shooter ever, at 6'10, with true point guard game, great finisher at the rim and perennial DPOY potential"
Giannis hit one 3 earlier on AD which opened that up. Which is why you cant just flat out refuse to shoot like Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons will learn to walk on water before shooting 6 threes in a game.
This is what Ben Simmons should try to do lol
"yeah, i tried to go with a non-star player but forgot to think about the goat aspect of it. I'd probably go with draymond or ben simmons then."
Aye don't put the Ben Simmons is a jumper away take on Stephen A. All of reddit was on that train till they decided turn on him in the last year or 2.
The Sixers need to make a reel of Giannis missed jumpers and show it to Ben Simmons.
Giannis should probably play like ben simmons
Ben Simmons or Westbrook are much worse than KG and answer the question pretty well
Ben in the full court: Ben Simmons  Ben in the half court: Bill Simmons
Marv sounds like an idiot. Giannis is very smart by practicing a skill crucial to his game. His In Game shooting can only get better by shooting in game.  Which really is what the regular season is best for at least for the elite teams. He‚Äôs smart not to be like Ben Simmons who doesn‚Äôt shoot therefore doesn‚Äôt improve.
Magic Johnson or LeBron. The bar is pretty god damn high for the GOAT over MJ don't know what you guys are talking about with Ben Simmons and KG
Umm Marv....Ever heard of a guy called Ben Simmons?
"Good reminder, people were sleeping on Ben Simmons limitations"
"Ben Simmons would be a 6'8 Curry at that point with his handles. Add his elite defense and athleticism, and that's GOAT material."
In terms of the hail mary fouls we normally see in the last minute?  That was Ben Simmons we fouled. Embiid didn't shoot a FT in the final 3ish minutes.
"I never understood that. As a team you can choose to run your offense through whoever you want. They choose to run it through Jokic because he's historically great at it. But he's not better on offense because he gets more assists than a center who doesn't make plays for the entire team the way he does. That's not his role. That'd be like (extreme example please do not take literally) me saying Ben Simmons is better than Steph Curry because he gets more rebounds. That's not his role.   But what you cannot chose is who protects the rim. That goes to the center. You can have another big come in and protect the rim like AD has, but you can't say ""yeah our center does not need to protect the rim."" I'm sure there are stats that say Jokic is super good at defense but I do not trust any of them because I look at him, I look at their defensive rating, and I look at their record. And it seems to all point to a lack of even average defense.   I will just *never understand* how Ben Simmons isn't allowed to be a non-shooter because he's a point guard, but a center can be a bad defender and no one gives a shit."
"Yeah, I mean defenders don't treat him like Ben Simmons but they don't treat him like Trae, either. I've been saying that he's short all the time because he's using a 2-motion shot form but not getting enough power in his legs (look at how high Kobe/Ray Allen get on their jumpshots). He either needs to generate more lift or he needs to change his shot form to a one-motion shot if he wants to be at least a decent 3 point shooter."
"Simmons's injury wasn't only discovered on the day of the game. [According to Doc Rivers](https://www.si.com/nba/76ers/news/sixers-ben-simmons-update-knee-injury-grizzlies) they knew about it after the previous game.  &gt;""Ben, in the Brooklyn game, had some knee stiffness,"" Doc Rivers said last weekend. ""We almost probably knew after the game [on Thursday] that he wouldn't play [on Saturday].""  So get your own facts straight."
The one that‚Äôs not Ben Simmons
Lauri and Coby is not an overpay‚Äîit‚Äôs an under pay. Ben Simmons is an All NBA player.
"Zion isn't a good 3pt shooter, but Ben Simmons is one of the worst ever."
"Much much much better shooter too. Not a good shooter, but we are comparing him to Ben Simmons here."
Only possible way to trade for him without Zach is Lauri showing he can be a consistent 20ppg player with above average efficiency for a season.  Maybe then a trade like Lauri+Otto for Simmons or Lauri+Coby (maybe a bit overpay? I have been hearing Ben is not as good as he was this season) for Simmons might work
I get it and partially I‚Äôm talking shit in saying Ben does not equal JT or even JB for that matter. Embiid is a generational talent and Sixers fans should pray someone else wastes years on Simmons ‚Äúpotential‚Äù
Zion is a better player than Ben Simmons wishes he could be bro Simmons is a dollar store Draymond at best
"couldnt be further off  zion is an elite scorer around the rim, and plays no defense  ben simmons plays defense"
Cousins could pass brother. Obviously jokic is a better passer but cousins could pass. Cousins can play offense on the same level or higher as these guys his defense was solid and is playmaking was above avg for a big. Also The kings didn‚Äôt a second or third All star caliber players like Jamal Murray or Ben Simmons or Tobias Harris.
You changed the subject first to deflect from the abomination that is ben simmons in the playoffs chief
"Yeah Ben Simmons and all of those amazing playoff performances, I remember them all"
This sub has been a Jokic fan club since the season started and nothing has changed from that. They also value Jokic's assists over JoJos defense which is weird when the sub talks about players like Ben simmons and judge him on his PPG and don't don't look at the assists column.
I don't want to talk about covid. It just makes me sad. So here are my quarter way predictions.   Mvp will win .. Lebron (lifetime achievement mvp)  should win Joel/Paul  Dpoy will win Ben Simmons  should win  Ben Simmons   Roy will win Ball.   Should win Haliburton/Maxey.   Comeback. Will win Durant.  Should win Durant  Coach. Will win. Rivers  should win Earl watson   West winners- lakers  East winners-Bucks  Lakers win the title Lebron the MVP.
"Rich Paul is payed millions of dollars to handle the business side of Ben Simmons‚Äô career.  That is literally his job.  Ben Simmons plays basketball and hires an agent to do all of the business stuff that Simmons knows nothing about, like this holdout."
"hello,  how do we know thats not ben simmons reddit account?  love, kareem"
Marshawn Lynch walked (but didn‚Äôt run it) so Ben Simmons could run.
There is no ‚ÄúDeadline‚Äù. If they keep Ben and he tanks his value then they aren‚Äôt Winning. But if they trade Ben for Garbage then they still aren‚Äôt winning. So it‚Äôs best to wait until an actual Star wants out to trade Simmons.   The fact that Ben is even coming back shows he‚Äôs lost the waiting game. So Idk why you said the Sixers ‚Äúcan‚Äôt win a waiting game‚Äù.
"You make good points but I think Thybulle is only going to get better, if refs are swallowing their whistle more on tricky shit that perimeter players are doing then he's going to be ridiculous. Just needs to keep working on his shot. As for pushing into transition I don't think you'll find a better young pg in the league then Fox (maybe one of the Sexland boys but it's hard to judge them on that cavs team). The dude's quick, can space if he needs to, and his assist number are not terrible.   Simmons being the best in the league at finding shooters just means less when everyone know in the playoffs you just slump off him and make a wall. And then if he doesn't have the ball in his hands he's essentially a non-threat. I'm just thinking out loud but if I was a Sixer's fan I'd be done with the Ben thing, seems miserable."
"""but if he wants out, he wants out""  How can you say this in a thread about Ben Simmons lmao  It doesn't matter if Lillard wants out. The Sixers do not have the assets necessary to acquire him."
"Honestly, I'm happy this is happening. While I love that players have more power in where they play today, it's getting absurd with players asking to opt out after signing a max contract a year or 2 into it.  Like if you have 3+ years on your contract, you need to suck it up and be professional. You can ask to be traded, but be professional about it and show up and do your job. You can whine to the media, but show up and play. Maybe don't be in the best shape. Maybe only give 80% instead of 100%. But just show up and play. And guess what, you might feel better about your situation if you're winning and playing with your team. If not, you're going to get better trade offers and get shipped out quicker.   I'm totally behind Philly holding out. Put that money you're getting from Ben and save it so you can use it to go above the salary cap next year while trying to reshape the team post-simmons."
why do people think Ben Simmons is some kind of game changer instead of a negative net asset like he actually is?  Ben Simmons is Drummond 2.0.
"Sure, but there's no way that Ben Simmons flies economy. Worst case is probably first-class, but more than likely he would fly out of the executive airport and none of that shit would matter"
Haha fuck rich Paul and fuck Ben Simmons. Match made in heaven
Ben Simmons needs to get out of Philly. He could've been MVP multiple times if they didn't make him a pass first guy
This just doesn't make sense to me. Ben Simmons is a known quantity. Playing a couple games this season should not change people's opinion of him.  If a GM changes their perspective on a player based on a few games rather than the multiple seasons and playoff appearances than they're stupid.   I don't see how his value changes at all.
Ben Simmons isn‚Äôt going to sit out the whole season‚Ä¶ because of the implication
I would actually become a Ben Simmons fan of he did this
Aaron Rodgers ü§ùBen Simmons
This is straight out of the Cuban Missile Crisis playbook. We wrote about it in [our newsletter last week](https://savethelottery.substack.com/p/the-ben-simmons-holdout-and-the-cuban) when we predicted Simmons would report.
ben simmons is like a mentally under developed Stefano.
"i think it started here  &gt;‚ÄúThink about three months ago when the Sixers are willing to give up Ben Simmons. You are like, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs see what we have to do to get him,‚Äô "" a Western Conference executive said to Pompey. ‚ÄúNow, the difference is Ben Simmons says he refuses to play for the Sixers. He wants to go to three California teams.  https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/nba-rumors-ben-simmons-prefers-trade-three-california-teams  tbf this a Pompey report and he's a hack...however he seems to be pretty strongly parroting Klutch talking points this fall"
do you know who ben simmons is lol
Ben Simmons hurt after stepping on Joel Embiids foot.
No the Nets get much worse. You can't have the ball in Ben Simmons' hands cos he can't shoot and you have James Harden sitting right there. And he does nothing worthwhile offball and is scared to make dunks over Trae Young. His defence isn't nearly as valuable as some people act either
"random realization i had yesterday:  kyrie has a 15% trade kicker!!! :D  ben simmons also has a 15% trade kicker, but if you're already being paid a max (according to your years of service and accolades) you can't get paid more on top of that, therefore ben's trade kicker is not a factor (supposedly).  So a max contract is, when you first get on the max scale, either 25%/30%/35% of the salary cap (depending on if you've had 0-6/7-9/10+ years of service to the league) in the first year of the contract and then up to 5 years with 8% raises on that starting number thereafter if you're re-signing with your team or 4 years with 5% raises on that starting number if you sign with a new team (this includes sign-and-trades, S&amp;T contracts are limited to 4 years and 5% raises).  you are eligible for a supermax, which accelerates you into that 35% bracket, while only having 7-9 years of service if you earn certain accolades _while still being on the team you ended your rookie contract on_.  (or into the 30% bracket while only having 4-6 years of experience.)  so steph/dame, never switched teams, could get supermax.  harden traded while on his rookie contract, could get supermax.  but kd, having completed his rookie scale contract and then his max extension on the sonics/thunder, and then choosing to sign with gsw as a FA with 9 years of experience, could not get that 35% max just then even if they had the capspace, he could only get the 30%.  and kyrie, completing his rookie contract on the cavs and then signing a rookie max extension, and then getting himself traded to the celtics, could not get the 35% supermax with 9 years of service on the next contract even if he stayed with the celtics.  (and luka's rookie max extension is for the 30% supermax, since he got all-nba twice that's a certainty even though he has a year left on his rookie contract.)  kyrie's current contract is $136.5M/4yrs, with 5% raises.  his 2021-22 salary is $35,328,700 (cap figure) while the salary cap is $112,414,000, so currently he's at 31.4% of the salary cap, the 5% raises having slightly outstripped the growth of the cap in the past couple years.  but if he signed a new contract today, having 10+ years of service means he could get a 35% max (the extension he hasn't signed yet would replace his 2022-23 PO year's salary with a bigger salary that's 35% of the cap and from there he'd get 8% raises, i believe).  so currently he's _not_ being paid the max he could be getting for his seniority.  therefore, the trade kicker should apply (to a certain extent), right?"
Ben Simmons first home game is gonna be absolute must watch TV. This is like Lebrons return to Cleveland in 2011
He was liking posts on Instagram about how much he could lose. I don‚Äôt think Ben Simmons was some unaware victim to rich Paul here
"Philly isn‚Äôt forced to do anything. He‚Äôs under contract.. he plays and gets paid or he doesn‚Äôt play and won‚Äôt get paid. Rich Paul should be telling Simmons that he has much more to lose than the Sixers do. Simmons should be playing right now and showing other teams why he‚Äôs valuable af. The better he plays, the more likely and more quickly he gets moved to a new team. Instead, he‚Äôs sitting at home looking like a selfish individual who doesn‚Äôt care about the team. (Not saying he is, just commenting on the optics from the outside looking in) Prospective teams see this and say ‚Äúwhy would I offer a billion draft picks to take on a deeply flawed player who doesn‚Äôt care about his team?‚Äù Best thing Ben could do right now is play. Just terrible handling of the entire situation on Simmons end."
"Thing is Harden was still putting up 25/10 without being cool with most of the team. Imagine how Ben Simmons who already has a ton of flaws plays with bunch of guys who hate him lol. Harden was still the clear leader of the team and controlled all the possessions because he was so talented and made everyone around him better. Simmons does a lot on defense and still set guys up, but his limitations are going to be way louder now I think."
"???? The point is that Ben cannot just ‚ÄútAnK hIs vAlUe‚Äù like Harden &amp; Vince because it‚Äôs fucking James Harden &amp; Vince Carter. No one is going to shit the bed over Ben Simmons. Best case scenario would‚Äôve been to up his trade value &amp; show off his potential for other teams if he really wants to leave Philly but also have money in return. Right now the only team that wants him is Minnesota because they are desperate for ANYTHING that makes them remotely better and even then, those talks might lead to nowhere"
"Thats what it seems like to me. Morey be like  ""See yall! Ben is going to come back and we are going to play this out deep into the season, if you REALLY want him then just fork over all those 1st rounders because everything is chill over here. We are just fine!""  &amp;#x200B;  Meanwhile you going to try to have Ben Simmons play after not speaking to ANY PLAYER ALL SUMMER and you had Danny Green specifically talk about how the team will look like depending on who they get back for Ben in a trade. That would be the most awkward player dynamic game ever. Like I can't imagine how it would be if Ben actually suited up to play after Joel called him borderline disrepectful to everyone on the team, unless Ben is a great man that owned up and apologized for everything. Would be some crazy comeback Disney story if he apologized to the whole organization and city and came out averaging 22/8/8 lol"
"Ben ""Jon Snow"" Simmons"
It‚Äôs not just one pay check though. All the money he was owed for his instalment (which is over $8M) was put into escrow and then fines were deducted from the escrow amount.   76ers and Morey really outplayed Klutch because they can‚Äôt be accused of not paying Ben - having put the money into escrow. But Ben doesn‚Äôt have access to the money and the 76ers can issue fines and collect the money no problem.   I always have said Morey thinks too highly of himself but the way he‚Äôs dealt with Simmons not showing up to camp has been a real 5head move. Remains to be seen if they can get any value for him though.
Ben Simmons to Santa Cruz SeaDubs
"Why wouldn't they? Right now GMs see a player who has decided not to play because he doesn't like how he's been treated by an organization, despite a fair amount of success and a massive contract (side note: I think Ben and the 76ers have both contributed to the current shitty situation in a big way). If he sits, any GM who trades for him would see that Ben is willing to lose money to get what wants. If he caves and goes back, at least GMs will see that he's only willing to go  so far to make a point. His behavior would still be a red flag, and some GMs would probably just decide he isn't worth it, but a playing Ben Simmons is definitely a more attractive trade chip then a sitting Ben Simmons."
I shout ben Simmons
Little did we all know this is actually Ben Simmons‚Äô evil twin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoUHfKvYeZQ  Ben Simmons left handedness confirmed.
"Wtf, how can you possibly say that you know **for a fact?** Are you personal friends with Ben Simmons?"
"If I'm Ben Simmons, I'm pissed off at Rich Paul. So many agents handle these things in silence.....but yet somehow this is a public fiasco in a market where its fanbase is loud and gaudy.   This is awful."
Seems like Ben Simmons realized he's under contract for 4 more years and the Sixers don't actually have to trade him.
If Ben Simmons comes back to Philly and sees time on the floor they should really make those games PPV.
"Ben Simmons is a  üêì, he would never"
You guys are seriously fucking delusional with this stuff  As if Ben Simmons has no voice and rich Paul is controlling him.
"""Hey guys, what'd I miss?""  ""Lots of shots and free throws.""  *Ben Simmons has demanded a trade again*"
"&gt;Simmons‚Äô defense has never been a vital factor  i think this is everyone disconnect and something you only see when you watch him night in and night out.  He checks everyone's #1 option down the stretch.   Especially when that top option isn't an elite scorer, they struggle.  Most games, in the last couple minutes he makes you change what you want to do.  It is how the Sixers consistently win games even with his half court offense limitations.   It's often a struggle and ugly as shit and people leave thinking we got lucky.  But really it's b/c Ben is 6-10 and able to hang 1-4 on the perimeter with almost everyone.  And combined with Embiid protecting the rim it causes havoc and wins games.  Especially in the regular season."
Ben Simmons talks a lot shit
Rich Paul needed a wakeup call to realize his client is Ben Simmons and not Harden/Paul George
"Wasted depends on what you want. If your goal is to trade Simmons then yeah, time wasted. If your goal is to get a [star player](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10009930-76ers-rumors-goal-is-less-to-trade-ben-simmons-and-more-to-acquire-damian-lillard), then not necessarily, you're just buying time and making the most of a crappy situation.  Morey seems to be very cool with waiting. Maybe someone like Lillard or Beal becomes available, but I wouldn't bet on it. Either way, he probably thinks that better returns will come from waiting, otherwise Simmons would be gone already."
Ben Simmons and the sixers are that one toxic couple that hates each other but always end up hooking back up for months after they break up.
At this rate Adele‚Äôs next album is gonna have a song about how Ben Simmons prevented her from spending time with her boyfriend.
Ben Simmons cant commit to anything.
My estimation of Ben Simmons as a man just fucking plummeted
We‚Äôre about to get the follow up tweet of ‚ÄúBen Simmons says this isn‚Äôt true‚Äù I‚Äôm sure
Ben Simmons caught Maya Jama texting Stormzy about how her boyfriend won‚Äôt show up to work after passing up a wide open dunk when he saw Trae Young closing out from the free throw line
This and the Ben Simmons situation are so played out.
Most orgs that feel this way don‚Äôt have pieces that move the needle for philly. In Washington‚Äôs case they‚Äôd rather suck with Bradley Beal than suck with Ben Simmons since brad doesn‚Äôt wanna leave
"Ben Simmons needs to get with someone who works at Little Debbie to discuss how to manage his finances.  Also, get some fudge rounds and oatmeal creme pies."
"He could do that, but with social media being an NBA player is very different than it was 17 years ago. He's going to be under the microscope more than ever before, I don't think it would be great for his image if he was dogging it.  I've been following the NBA for maybe 10 years now and never heard about the Vince Carter thing until it became a possibility for Ben to do the same. Maybe I'm alone but I don't think it was a big part of VC's legacy/persona. I don't think Simmons will fly under the radar like that."
"It‚Äôs not the agent cut, Rich Paul has more than enough money to care about one missed cut from one player‚Äôs salary. It‚Äôs that player telling him, ‚Äúfigure this out, I don‚Äôt want to lose money‚Äù that is motivating discussions.   So yeah, Rich is folding but on behalf of Ben Simmons."
Ben Simmons giving up when something gets tough is quite the development
Next up 6er fans: yeah we know he's crazy but at least he isn't Ben Simmons!
"Cancun, Mexico (October 11, 2021) - The following statement was released today by Ben Simmons, through his agent and close friend Rich Paul, of Klutch Sports Group (Klutch) located in Los Angeles, California in response to questions about his future in Philadelphia:  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm back.‚Äù"
"Ben Simmons is a capable shooter, he just hates Philly"
"It's really sad that's all it took.   And didn't he just sell his condo? You telling me you're not prepared enough for a holdout that missing the first check was enough to do you in?  A bread maker in a union is somehow able to save enough money to outlast a strike, but Ben Simmons is done after one check?  Pathetic. I have no respect for that guy."
"Ben Simmons hurt his back sleeping on the floor, out for the season."
Serious: Who have better career?   Ash Ketchum or Ben Simmons?
"Ben Simmons has caved, folks. This was fun while it lasted though!"
Ben Simmons hopes are unchanged too.
"I feel like you're not taking my comment in the way I intended. I don't want to lose Ben Simmons for 0. I think having Ben Simmons makes the 76ers a much better team than not having him. However, I would rather the 76ers be a worse team than have Kyrie Irving on my favorite team."
This is my thing if Ben Simmons comes back and he‚Äôs really just the same player with no noticeable improvements is any team going to upgrade their package before the playoffs where he usually fans out ?
"Ben Simmons reportedly ""would have no problems getting the fuck out of Philly for anywhere"" is what they mean"
&gt;You‚Äôre also not getting Ben Simmons for Beasley lol.  Why is this the topic of discussion now lol?
"You haven‚Äôt seen their schedules, then.   You‚Äôre also not getting Ben Simmons for Beasley lol."
"I'd love assets for Ben! I'd want heavy assets for Ben in ALMOST any circumstance rather than lose him. The one scenario I wouldn't want assets for Ben Simmons is if that asset happens to be Kyrie ""Flat earth, anti-vax nutjob"" Irving."
Ben ‚ÄúPaper hands‚Äù Simmons
Sacramento? That's a 20 minute flight to San Francisco &amp; an hour flight to LA   -Ben simmons logic
Kyrie will go silent for a week again and then we'll get the Ben Simmons for Kyrie Woj bomb. Just like last year with Harden
It turns out Ben Simmons like myself likes money
Sixers and Klutch probably leaked this as some kind of deal to get the sixers some leverage back and to get Ben Simmons where he wants to go.
"People always just shout ‚Äúbut this sub constantly shits on them, so they can‚Äôt be overrated!‚Äù  Well, here‚Äôs the thing, Westbrook and DeRozan are still overrated.   Fuck Ben Simmons."
"So the Pacers have TJ Warren and Ben Simmons then. Yeah, that sounds like a team destined for the lotto."
"It's going to be a major discussion point in every basketball related show/podcast.   I wouldn't be surprised if teams that are being discussed as possible suitors have announcers bringing it up during games.  No matter what happens, Philly does well or struggles, people will talk about what this means regarding Simmons impact on the game.   I believe the Sixers are waiting to see if certain players react poorly to how their team starts, or a franchise gets desperate. If Sac struggles in their first 20 games, maybe they decide to blow it up and give up Fox.  There's at least another month of this nonsense. Not to mention the responses every time Ben starts missing Gameday checks."
"The summer of 2021 aka ""the Ben Simmons summer"" is near its end"
"Pick the Sixers! You‚Äôll laugh. You‚Äôll cry. But most of all, you will learn to hate Ben Simmons"
"I find it more surprising that Ben Simmons has only dated (confirmed) 6 women since he entered the NBA, given his young socialite life style, I thought the number was higher."
"its the law of diminishing returns. the nets dont really miss out on offense losing kyrie but gain A FUCKTON of defense. I know we like to meme ben simmons for not improving his offense, but the guy is an elite defender."
"That's exactly what I am saying. I think Russ/LeBron and AD fundamentally don't work as a half-court offence. The Lakers with KCP, Dennis and Buddy Hield are a better team IMO and make more sense as a team.  I didn't say AD has to be a playmaker. He's not. He has a good face up and is a great rim runner. Have him do more of that, not less.   AD shot 26% from 3 last season and is 31% of his career. That's worse than Draymond Green. AD's shot dies once he gets outside 15 feet. Having him hang around the permitter to make space for LeBron and Russ to play in the restricted area isn't getting the best out of him.  AD was 4th in the league in post-ups in the Lakers title year. Just behind Jokic. Design an offence where AD posts and face-ups more and rim runs more. Not one where he is standing at the 3 point line. If AD has to take 4, 3s a game, and LeBron is taking 7 a game you have fundamentally failed at team building.  Adding on. Russ is not a good pick and roll point guard for his flashy highlights. .71 PPP as the pick and roll handler last year. That's like Ben Simmons level bad, and it's also in line with his last few seasons. Having AD helps, but if you are expecting Russ/AD to be a much better pick and roll combo than AD/Dennis you are going to be disappointed.  LeBron missed 26 games last year? He is going to ""rest"" for 1/3rd of the season this year?"
"If Ben Simmons can get Sacramento back to the playoffs after 15+ years, they will build a statue of him outside their arena."
I would sacrifice my firstborn son to stop hearing news about Ben Simmons
"Idk, I think Ben Simmons (and Rich Paul) might actually want the heat so Philly would be forced to trade him ASAP. If his camp doesn‚Äôt do something else, it seems like Sixers are going to try to keep him as long as they can while looking for their godfather offer"
Ben Simmons should send Kyrie Irving flowers for taking so much heat off him to finish this offseason
Trade Kyrie for Ben Simmons you cowards. Descend into anarchy
"If you aren't a threat to shoot, they play off you and you can't drive. You have to be a threat. Jason Kidd was jacking up shots from day-1. Rondo too. This is why Ben Simmons is so overrated, because folks don't understand this.  The real answer is that Russ doesn't play under control or with consistent good decision making."
"he has the iq, but i can't see him commiting to a coaching gig. unless you're being silly and just saying ben simmons because ben simmons"
Well i‚Äôve dated just as many women as i have career 3 pointers so i can say thay i am almost as good with women as ben simmons!
DeMar would have been an excellent get for Ben Simmons.
I thought the ben simmons max contract is a bad decision. wonder how it ended
Ben Simmons knows to get rid of property before it starts depreciating
Ben Simmons out here playing Rent-A-Girlfriend irl
Ben Simmons lol.
"Westbrook needs to be the focal point of any offense with the neon green light if he is to have any impact. Any possession that he is not the focus is a wasted possession, he doesn't even move off ball. At all. Put him in the corner like Bosh or Love and see what happens. The only thing that would be even weirder is bringing him off the bench, Russ would undermine the team so hard that fans would be praying for Ben Simmons for Russ just to bring more stability"
Ben Simmons.
"If you cut off the second half of both sentences, you just described Ben Simmons."
"I am a huge Harden fan, would take him over Giannis 8 days a week.  That being said, 6'7"" Giannis is probably almost about as good as Ben Simmons was in his first couple seasons.  If Harden added 75 lbs of pure fat he would have type 2 diabetes and would probably go into cardiac arrest 5 minutes into a game."
"It's not actually hard at all to repeat it and remember it once you've heard it pronounced correctly. I've noticed that they rush to get these guys nicknames so they don't have to worry about it. One of the reason the NBA world calls Jokic Joker, despite having zero qualities or traits of the character. We could have found something that shows his occasional hot-headedness or his skill but naw, that's too much effort. Jokic kinda sounds like Joker so let's call him that and call it a day lol.   It's like calling Ben Simmons Deadshot."
"I remember thinking that Ben Simmons not being able to get his team into the tourney was pretty weak, but he did average 19.2/11.8/4.8 so it‚Äôs not like he was terrible"
"Eh. You say the might have been able to do that with the sixers, but if this sixers didn‚Äôt want to give up 8 first round picks then they couldn‚Äôt lol. Obviously the rockets were interested in picks over players. The sixers package would‚Äôve Ben Simmons and some picks while the nets revolved around all those picks. The rockets valued the picks more and still got oladipo"
Ben Simmons &gt; 4 draft picks. IMO
Ben Simmons to Lebron
"Read the Rockets sub a few days before the trade, I feel like they were really underrating Ben Simmons."
"Yeah. You'll probably run into some issues with how you create your ""uncovered baseline"", because most players don't have enough shots everywhere to create a good baseline for them, which means that you probably need to rely on a league average in some way, which would mean that it's as bad for the defense to not defend a Ben Simmons or Russell Westbrook 3 as not defending a Steph Curry 3."

Simmons or 4 picks that are 25 to 30?  I know reddit hates Ben but come on... hes arguably the DPOY.
"I agree that wall and Simmons is a terrible fit, but at this point they are tanking. Wall has been a pleasant surprise but they didn‚Äôt trade for the guy who hadn‚Äôt played basketball in 2 years, is also reliant on his athleticism ball Dominant a em a shaky shot just like Westbrook.  Westbrook demanded out and wall was the best they could do. They just gave up allen for a late 25-29 milwulker pick.  Oladipo has made it known to Toto Miami but we don‚Äôt have trade leverage bc in the offseason they can sign him outright.  Remember of those picks, okc has our swap rights in 21/25, our hope is by 24 nets might struggle but that is a huge if. Nets are an amazing market a fresh brand and competent organization who can clearly attract Talent. Your betting they won‚Äôt recover before the rockets who has a severely leverage cost conscious owner.   Ben Simmons gives them a star piece and you can have value in that. Woods and Simmons would be great and you get rid of wall when you can for what you can as he‚Äôs not a long term fit. But Simmons and woods would make that more worth it.  Rockets wi just B looking for picks but they are too good for their top 4 Protected pick and too bad to make any noise"
Ben Simmons career average is 16/8/8
LeBron falling off a cliff would mean he averages 19/8/6 on league average efficiency.  So he'd basically be a better Ben Simmons on offense. That's how good he is.
Yeah how he missed the ben simmons the greatest scorer of all time.
"Except he's a horrible fit with John Wall who is also not a good shooter and the Rockets will be hardcapped even after this season so they can't sign anyone to improve the roster.  If they trade Wall for a superior talent (keep in mind, they'd have to get someone back that will make them a championship caliber team), they'd have to ship out all their picks which they are already short on. Otherwise they'd just be a mediocre playoff team that's going nowhere.   Trading for Ben Simmons just doesn't make any sense when the Rockets want to do a full rebuild. If they had their own picks I'd agree with you but since the Westbrook trade they gave half their future picks to OKC. Also, Simmons could easily walk when his contract ends since the Rockets won't be able to contend."
"the Simmons package would include 2 FRP (lottery protected)  If the Rockets dealt Simmons to another team, is he worth 2 future unprotected firsts and 4 unprotected pick swaps? And keeping in mind the chances of Brooklyn being terrible are highly likely after 2022.  I don't know what team out there would trade 2 unprotected firsts and 4 unprotected pick swaps for Ben Simmons that will also end up being bad enough for the Rockets to consider the picks."
"Exactly. How are the Rockets supposed to build around Simmons when they are salary capped with Wall, Simmons and Wood on the roster? It doesn't make any sense to trade for Simmons. They'd have to ship Wall out for a superstar that matches Simmons skillset (he wont shoot).  Wall + Simmons is a terrible combo, they aren't winning jack shit with that duo and to send Wall out for a superior talent to pair with Simmons they'd have to add picks they already don't have enough of.   People keep clowning the Rockets for taking ""Oladipo over Simmons"" but they don't use their brain first. Also, let's just say Tilman accepts that Simmons package that comes with Thybulle (Maxey rumor was never confirmed) and 2 FRPs (likely lottery protected knowing Morey's past), they'd still be going nowhere in terms of championship contention. They'd have to deal Simmons later on down the line, is Ben Simmons worth 2 unprotected firsts and 4 unprotected pick swaps from a team who will likely be terrible in 3 years? Unlikely.  Taking the Nets package was clearly the best option for the Rockets in terms of a full rebuild otherwise they'd be at best a bottom playoff seed in the West."
To make careless statements while coming off pretentiously in reference to basketball. I had a neph moment the other day when I said Ben Simmons is maybe a top 5 defender. Didn‚Äôt realize he was actually probably number 1 or 2 bc I‚Äôm a casual lol.
"Getting a young talent like Ben Simmons is kinda of what you hope for with the picks, it was a lot better to get a good young player like Simmons than hope to find it with late picks. They won't even have their own pick this year"
"Ben Simmons isn't hitting 6 or 7 (or whatever number of threes it was) in *any* game.   That's just one of the many differences between the two...  I find that people here on r/NBA love to call any player who doesn't score much a version of Ben Simmons.  ""Is Lonzo just small Ben Simmons?""  Like holy shit, there are probably 30 other players in the history of the NBA who are way more comparable to Lonzo than fucking Ben Simmons. Lonzo and Ben Simmons are not even remotely similar outside of their common ability to pass (completely different types of passers) and weakness in scoring and finishing. There are other traits!!"
"Its pretty simple.  Harden was a cancer destroying the team.  The sooner he left, the better.  The picks they got go through 2027 which is pretty fucking nice, especially considering they are in need of replenishing their draft picks.  Yes, the ones in the near future wont be great, but after a year or two you have no idea what NBA will look like.  Plus, any team you trade Harden to will be pretty good so its not like they couldve gotten high lottery picks out of this.    Everyone is also talking about Ben Simmons, but to be completely honest idk if I would want him as a max contract while trying to rebuild.  Draft picks are nice but the real way you build a championship team is by having cap flexibility to sign FA or make big trades when they present themselves. Im also not sold on Simmons long term.  It doesnt look like he is putting any effort into improving as a scorer."
"If you kind of think about it and squint really hard Ben Simmons is just a more athletic Draymond Green  Edit: I know he‚Äôs better but there games are pretty similar, also Ben doesn‚Äôt kick people in the balls as much"
"Ben Simmons is exactly what you want in a rebuild, he's only 24."
"Ben Simmons and Bam Adebayo are the same player, but one is considered a PG the other one a C."
"yea morey talked about it. because even tillman admitted that his basketball ops team was 'cold' on the deal, but he pushed it through saying you gotta keep things exciting.  Kobe/shaq, ben simmons/embiid these things are usually overblown, they can make it work once you hooop and the fact is they were successful together.    remeber why heat pay haslem to be on the roster even though he doesnt play? Glue guys. Paul and harden were both vocal, as was ariza, that ariza was a vital glue guy and had the ear of both the teams star and respect enough to keep things in line. that could've made the difference, those details matter for teams going for it, but thats where tillman skimps on the margins and keeps the big names and draws.  but yea morey mentioned he talked to harden and harden was fine if we built on the current team, the owner ran the play by play on cowherd and admitted he was teh force that made it go through  it goes to show harden was willing to go back to morey or MDA, they also left tillman, almost like harden wasn't the problem as the PR push by tillmans bitch tim mcmahon"
"Your team and franchise is the biggest joke in the nba. As most Celtics fans have learned being ""rivals"" with your team, Ben simmons is a glorified role player, embiid is the softest superstar in the league, you have amazingly terrible ownership and gms, and your players don't like the fans. Everyone on this sub will be dead before the 76ers win another championship. But enjoy the month of braindead hype for going 7-1 against all lotto teams!"
I think they got the better deal all the same. Wouldn't you rather have 4 1sts and 4 pick swaps and Victor Oladipo + Exum then Ben Simmons?
I‚Äôll always have respect for TJ after what he did to us in the 2018 series for the Sixers. He was better than Ben Simmons
"If those picks are Ben Simmons, we're not winning anything we didn't win with James."
"Draymond is just worse Ben Simmons, he's worse in everything but BBIQ"
"If two years from now Ben Simmons still can‚Äôt shoot, his value will be lower. It was highest two years ago right when he won rookie of the year  You might know basketball statistics but I don‚Äôt think you understand the first thing about asset management if you can‚Äôt see the difference between that and a FRP on the market"
What was the alternative?  A Ben Simmons + John Wall pairing perma 9th seed?  They're rebuilding.  I guess they could've taken Simmons and flipped for more assets... but we don't know:  in that scenario would there have been interested parties who weren't needing to send back long term contracts?
"So you blew off the best offer on the table to be a petty bitch? Yea, you don't deserve that team. You said no to ben fucking simmons because you couldn't get over yourself for two seconds."
"Everyone on this sub hates on Ben Simmons, says he‚Äôs an offensive liability, and that ‚Äúhe‚Äôs the type of player he is at this point‚Äù but somehow the rockets are royally fucked by not trading for him. Makes plenty of sense ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"
The Sixers wouldn‚Äôt have Ben at that point. Were talking about a hypothetical where the Rockets would be interested in flipping Simmons to save cash
Wall is on the books for 3 seasons and is impossible to trade. Should the rockets just wait around for 3 years with Ben Simmons and wall until wall is gone?
"BPA&gt;Fit has backfired too.   ATL drafted ""BPA"" Marvin Williams when they already had Joe Johnson, Josh Smith, Al Harrington, and Josh Childress as wings. In doing so, they passed up ""better fit"" prospects like Chris Paul and Deron Williams, even though they badly needed a PG.   Then the next year they drafted another ""BPA"" forward, Shelden Williams, instead of ""better fit"" Brandon Roy. By the time they realized their mistake, they had to trade Shelden Williams for a washed, overpaid Mike Bibby.   Or how about MIN drafting 2 ""BPA"" PGs in a row (Rubio, Johnny Flynn)? Or the Clippers drafting 2 PFs in a row (Chris Wilcox, Melvin Ely), when they already had Elton Brand and Chris Kaman?   DET drafted BPA Darko when they already had Ben Wallace at C, instead of better fit Chris Bosh to replace Elden Campbell (though they eventually traded for Sheed to fill the PF spot).   PHI went BPA Fultz when they already had Simmons at PG, instead of better fit Tatum to replace Robert Covington/Dario Saric.   MIL chose BPA Jabari Parker when they already had Giannis at PF, instead of better fit Embiid to replace Zaza Pachulia.   NY picked Jordan Hill when they already had David Lee at PF, instead of better fit Demar Derozan to replace Jared Jeffries.   UTA picked BPA Trey Lyles when they already had Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors at forward, instead of better fit Devin Booker to replace Rodney Hood.   ORL drafted BPA Mo Bamba when they already had Vucevic at C, instead of better fit Collin Sexton to replace DJ Augustin.  You can find examples to support either approach. There's no single correct way."
Shake and Maxey gonna be Embiids second option by committee.  PF Ben Simmons? time will tell.
Ben Simmons sucks that
"1. LeBron 2. Giannis 3. KD 4. AD 5. Steph 6. Kawhi 7. Harden 8. Dame 9. Luka 10. Jokic 11. Embiid 12. Paul George 13. Bradley Beal 14. Jayson Tatum 15. Devon Booker 16. Jimmy Butler 17. Jaylen Brown 18. KAT 19. Ben Simmons 20. Kyrie 21. CJ 22. Khris Middleton 23. Sabonis 24. Brandon Ingram 25. Chris Paul 26. Trae Young  I would take any of these players over Westbrook in a heartbeat and I'm probably forgetting others. He might compete for that next spot with Donovan Mitchell, Zach Lavine, and Vucevic."
"&gt; you get 6‚Äô8 point guard/forwards who can also shoot once a decade. Lebron, Lamelo, Luka. Ben Simmons  Clearly that's not true if we got 3 this decade."
"I was getting flamed for this in the stream chat, but I thought this was a great game for Miami. Sometimes you miss wide open looks. This margin would have been a *lot* tighter if Olynyk hits some of those open looks. Herro, guarded by Ben fucking Simmons, was basically the only guy who could create a look... and he was doing it. Midrange Duncan showed up, those curls into the paint for an easy floater are going to be lethal in the playoffs, Herro‚Äôs turnovers are lobs when you‚Äôre throwing to Bam, etc. Heat looked good, Sixers just looked great."
Feels like Rockets got the worst of the 3 major deals.  Philly had the best deal in Ben Simmons but Fritata didn't want to trade Harden there.  Boston had the 2nd best but they passed on Harden.  Nets had the worst with LeVert/Oladipo and that's pretty much it and Houston was forced to accept that.
"I need the Pistons to win so badly tonight. I hate the fucking Sixers. In fact they're my least favorite team in the NBA right now and it's not even close.  Fuck Embiid and his trashtalking ass. Shut the fuck Up and go accomplish something first.  Fuck the Process. Fuck Sam Hinkie. It's not adorable to be utter shit for several years by choice. It's pathetic.  Most of all FUCK THE MEDIA for all the attention they spend on these loosers despite them not even trying to win fucking games.  Fuck the Media for celebrating every tweet of Joel ""69% conditioning"" Embiid. I was so happy when I saw Jalen Rose told that punk to shut his mouth and act like a professional.  But most of all Fuck them for crowning their asses before they've done anything. At this point ""RoCo"" (what a stupid nickname) is the wet dream of half the NBA writers across the League. Ben Simmons is LeBron 2.0 and Embiid is basically Shaq with a 3 point shot.  Fuck the Sixers, Fuck Embiid, Fuck Sam Hinkie, Fuck the Process. Also FTP.  EDIT: LOL I see a lot of Sixers fans coming over here acting like fucking childs. Let me just say this:  I have more respect for the 2008 Detroit Lions than for the 2015/16 Sixers as the Lions at least tried to win a game."
"Ben ""All-NBA"" Simmons gonna get left wide open in the playoffs again and be responsible for another 76'rs playoff exit, Bismack Biyombo with a handle and vision, actually that's disrespect to Biyombo because he can at least protect the paint"
What about Ben Simmons and Jamal Murray? Blake Griffin? Chris Paul? There are a lot of guys making the max who clearly don't/didn't want to be traded.
But those picks could be anything! Even Ben Simmons!
what if the nets 2027 pick is just ben simmons again though??? nets playing 5d interdimensional uno rn
Ben Simmons a couple rebounds from a triple double
"I'm not going to join this argument but I do question this take: Simmons on the Lakers makes them unstoppable. What about Simmons do you think complements LeBron and AD so well? From what I can tell, Jaylen is a much better fit for the Lakers than Ben since the Lakers probably want as much spacing as possible."
Man I swear every time Ben Simmons dunks it they give the 76ers 2 points
"Then he should have said that instead of this weird comparison between Oladipo (who actually isn't even a part of the Harden trade anyways) and Ben Simmons.  Also fair to note that the double draft is imminent - meaning there's basically 2 lotteries in one draft, or perhaps 1.5 if we're being realistic with the entering HS players - and HOU is now guaranteed somewhere between one and four FRPs in that draft, depending on which year it ends up being."
"In the west, the best version of Oladipo would take a team to a 1st round exit at best. You will also be lucky to draft a player of Ben Simmons caliber with those nets pick."
the legend of the Ben Simmons jump pass continues
"Apologies, fit is a HUGE factor.  But time and time again, we've seen that when superstars want to play together, they will make it work.  They will have to adjust their games but its not like you have Ben Simmons or WB on this team.  You got 3 guys who can stretch the floor.  3 guys who demands attention."
"You don't understand. Ben Simmons is Ben Simmons, but those picks could be anything. They could even be Ben Simmons!"
"TIL, it has been over 10 minutes since Ben Simmons last attempted a 3 in an NBA game."
Ben Simmons needs to empty his mind and he is god lol it‚Äôs 100% mental
Just trade Kyrie for Ben Simmons and have it done with.
Ben Simmons is less and less desirable every single year. Sorry but I‚Äôll take the OKC route over being an 8 seed for the next 5 years.
"Mike ""Give me Brice Johnson over Ben Simmons"" Wilbon"
"Unpopular opinion:  I'd rather have a delusional Kyrie than Simmons. Kyrie's spacing, shot creating and scoring punch alongside Embiid? I don't care if I lose Simmons' defense if I still have prime Embiid  There's a 50-50 chance Kyrie will just not show up to play for your team in the playoffs, but Ben never shows up in the playoffs anyways"
"My hot take is that Ben Simmons is a complete mirage.  He's great in the open court, but most NBA players can get it done in transition so does that really count for that much?  In the half court, he's unplayable.  He's scared of shooting free-throws, which hurts his willingness &amp; ability to finish in traffic &amp; play physically, which is something he should do considering his size &amp; gifts.  For his career he averages less than 1 FTA/game more than Steph Curry (!!!!).   And on defense, Simmons is great because of his size and he can do a lot on ball, but he also coasts on that end and has some bad mental lapses.  It was a knock on him in the draft that he'd lose interest, particularly on defense and if you watch today you will still see that in stretches.  There's as much flat-footed, passive play as there is lock-down effort.     For the physical gifts he has, he could be better than he is. Lots of people still seem to be projecting tons of growth onto his game, but he's been the same guy doing the same thing for 4 years now, at some point he is who he is.  If you want ben Simmons on your team you have to restructure everything you do around him to maximize his strengths &amp; cover up his (glaring) weaknesses.  I'd much rather have a guy who tries his ass off all the time, is committed to getting better every day and can fit into any system &amp; any role you create for him."
"A worse gamble than getting Ben Simmons, though.  And Simmons likely would've come with some picks as well."
"I like Ben Simmons a lot, but I too prefer 7 unprotected picks over him. Doubt the 76s would have been that flexible."
I'd take Brown just so I can avoid all the shit taking that comes with Simmons. It's like at least 10 posts a day in this sub that people shit on Ben it's not even funny
Jaylen Brown is so much better its not funny .          Ben Simmons is a defensive specialist.           Brown is a budding superstar two way player who is already better than Paul George
"lol saying that Ben Simmons shies away from contact might literally be the most inaccurate criticism that anyone has ever made of him.  i can't even comprehend how someone could come to that conclusion. like normally when someone says something that dumb it's a case of looking at stats instead actually watching any games, but just spending 30 seconds checking his rebound numbers should be enough to prevent anyone from having your opinion."
"A 24 year old All NBA player is not going to depreciate in value, discussion around Ben Simmons are always kind of hilarious but it's gotten to the people are fooling themselves into the idea of 2026 picks that might if things go right be in the top 10 are better assets. This is exactly what I mean by false hope. You know what you have in Simmons a 24 year old All NBA player. Because youve seen him and see his weaknesses youll obsess over those because the false hidden allure of those picks have no weaknesses to focus on like him.   The average outcome of picks in the 7-12 type range are career backups/lower end starters. Far far cry from an All NBA player. The Rockets have clearly shown for 30+ years no real interest in doing a full tear down and rebuilding in that market. Ben Simmons alone gives you a real floor, you saw in 2018 what it was when Embiid was out, it's not hard to build a 43-39 type team around him. This reductive"" title contender or bust"" approach fans have is devoid of reality, these picks 6-7 years down the road even if they wont hit wont actually pay off until about a decade from now. You dont run a business model on the false allure of that you have to worry about the next 5-10 years also having a competent product matters."
Ben simmons
Ben Simmons in shambles
He might lose Oladipo too! 4 1st picks might all end up in 20-30 too! Crazy sequence for an ignorant owner. Imagine having the chance to build around Ben Simmons! He could have most likely also had Mathias Thybull and possibly 2 1st rounds from Sixers... Holy shit I feel sorry for Houston!
"Honestly where does a team of Wall + Simmons ü§¢ and a nearly empty cupboard of assets get you? They‚Äôd have to completely retool their roster around Simmons while still having contracts like Eric gordon and John Wall on the books. They wouldn‚Äôt be competitive now, and it would be seriously difficult to build around what they do have   Those first round picks and an expiring oladipo are assets that won‚Äôt depreciate like a Ben Simmons that still can‚Äôt shoot or a LeVert who still hasn‚Äôt put it together either."
"Philly, where Ben Simmons on a blue moon will get 20? Embiid will get his, but I doubt Philly is the team that can do it against the Nets' high-powered offense."
People really think you can just Voltron those picks into a player better than Ben Simmons huh?
"/u/Bigearl139   This dude could of had Ben Simmons but since he hates Morey, he ends up getting Odalipo instead.."
Ben Simmons can't shoot. You can't win with a star that can't shoot in today's NBA. There's a reason the Sixers disappoint in the playoffs every year. I don't blame Houston for passing that guy up.
7 picks that likely won‚Äôt be a Ben Simmons caliber player
Griffin for Simmons straight up. Take this deal quick 76ers because I don't even like Ben Simmons really at all.
Ben Simmons is a weird PG who has no shot and is like 2 inches short of 7 feet lol
"It's funny how we spent all this time laughing at the idea that the Nets offer wouldn't get it done, and guess what, it actually got it done lol. They literally went with Oladipo (who they might just let walk this summer) and picks instead of an actual building piece in Ben Simmons."
"i don't like that because i feel like a hater saying this because everybody is so high on him and any half decent play of his finishes in front page of this sub, but jeez i feel like people are way too high on lamelo  we just had trae, luka, jah, zion in the last two years, and sure this year is very strange due to covid and shit, but he's nowhere near them (and i'm just talking skill/ability)  i've watched him the last two games and i tagged along for some of his australian games and the observation is the same, genuenly strong rebounders, good passing instincts, no reliable way to score at all in Australia, let alone in the NBA, that includes shooting but he can't finish at all, even his handles are eh (but his size is great and he looked even taller than in my memories, maybe he did grew)  even Ben simmons can score, you can't be all that in today's NBA without being able to score at all, the very best case scenario in that case is rubio, which is a very good player but as i said it's the very best case scenario, rubio is supremely talented and honestly probably more than lamelo  time will tell, and there are cases when i feel like i'm blind not seeing what everybody's seeing, hopefully for him and the hornets i'm dead wrong, but it jumps out everytime i watch him play"
"I see him as somewhere in the middle between draymond and giannis. I think the biggest issue everyone has with Ben is everyone wants/expects him to be the next lebron or giannis but he seems content with being Ben Simmons. His elite level of defense, transition and playmaking helps him be a super valuable piece for any contending team but he needs scorers around him to be at his best.   For me, it‚Äôs just frustrating that people can‚Äôt seem to separate best player from best scorer. I swear most people just look at the box score and see less than 20 in the points column and decided he sucks at basketball lol"
"with any luck, maybe they get a better player than Ben Simmons with one of those picks in, uhh, 2026"
"Every year you‚Äôve had a hyper athletic center(Ashton,KAT,Wiseman) you get 6‚Äô8 point guard/forwards who can also shoot once a decade. Lebron, Lamelo, Luka. Ben Simmons up there if he can ever shoot."
If Ben Simmons is considered a PG then Lebron is too right
"Who cares what the fit is with Wall? He's irrelevant. Your future right now regardless is a lotto team without any of your own picks lol.   So you passed up on tangible talent you hope turns into quality players like Jaylen Brown, Ben Simmons or Tyler Herro? Particularly with the Sixers, but also those other teams, your asking prices were way too high. So now you get to either wait for middle schoolers to turn into elite college players when you can draft them...and get to be what exactly in the meantime?"
"1. Bradley Beal FOR Pascal Siakam  2. Bradley Beal FOR Jrue Holiday  3. Bradley Beal FOR Tyler Herro, Andre Iguodala, Kelly Olynk  4. Bradley Beal FOR Ben Simmons  5. Bradley Beal FOR Al Horford, 4 1st Round picks  6. Bradley Beal FOR Jamal Murray  7. Bradley Beal FOR Eric Bledsoe, JJ Redick, 2 1st Round picks  8. Bradley Beal FOR Kemba Walker, Payton Pritchard  Which of these trades is the best?"
I clearly made him up in a previous post. Is there a real Ben Simmons that I should apologize to?
"I‚Äôm a short, fat, 26 year old Half-Colombian Jewish man. I wish Ben Simmons were my grandson so I could teach him how to shoot the damn ball."
Defensively and in transition I like with Deni. Rui is a terrible fit with Ben Simmons tho
If that‚Äôs true Tillman is an idiot. Simmons is like 24 and (for all his talent) he isn‚Äôt good enough to lead a team rn as is. He had no reason to think a Ben Simmons led team had to win now.
I'd say insisting to every person in this thread associating a statline that is strictly Ben Simmons career statline that it's just a hypothetical is down the middle for the definition of being...  pedantic.
"Again, I‚Äôm not talking about Ben Simmons. This is your insecurity showing. I merely want to discuss the value of knowing a player will have this average box score versus the prospects of every other player in the draft being unknown."
Ben Simmons and Deni Avdija would be fun
Basically a Ben Simmons that can shoot
"We get it, you hate Ben Simmons. No GM would draft a player with that little information. They would have a scout go see them and tell you more about them. It would also depend on the draft around them. Who are this other players available, what else can I get? This is an absurdly stupid premise and you should feel bad about posting it."
"I would draft Ben Simmons first, maybe 2-3 depending on if there‚Äôs another truly elite prospect"
I thought Ben Simmons was better than Lebron?
He took 3s because ben simmons doesn't. He's taken less 3s this year and focused more in the close midrange.
"I would actually love if they got a bunch of bricklayers. Steven Adams, Ben Simmons, Draymond, and Joakim Noah. That would be so entertaining."
"For anyone interested in the actual breakdown or ‚Äúhow well that turned out‚Äù, here you go:  Ben Simmons was guarded by Rudy Gobert for 4 minutes, 26 seconds.  Gobert Defending       ‚Ä¢  FG ‚Äî 3/7 (42.9%)       ‚Ä¢  AST/TO ‚Äî 1/3 (0.33)  Not Gobert Defending       ‚Ä¢  FG ‚Äî 12/19 (63.2%)       ‚Ä¢  AST/TO ‚Äî 11/1 (11.0)"
Ben Simmons and Gobert?
"&gt; Yeah except he's averaging 67% from the line this year and has consistently trended up his entire career so 70+% should be a given going forward.  He has never shot 70% from the FT line in his career, so why should that be a given? 67% is 10% below league average.  &gt; You think giving up 1.4~ points isn't the worst thing you can do? The only play worse than that would be giving up an open 3 to an elite shooter.  I would argue giving up 2 points instead of contesting a shot would be worse. As I said he's a good finisher and it will result in a lot of and-1s, so obviously fouling him isn't the best thing to do, but I'd rather him shooting FTs than most players.  &gt; Consistently being the top or one of the top creators of open 3s along with 8 assists per game isn't elite? Meanwhile you label Jaylen ""4 assists with 3 turnovers per game"" Brown as a ""good"" passer?  Simmons is currently 11th in assists, obviously very good, but I would put that a tier below elite. hence ++, not elite. Of course he's one of the best passes in the NBA, and saying he's a ++ passer is not a knock on him.  &gt; Meanwhile you label Jaylen ""4 assists with 3 turnovers per game"" Brown as a ""good"" passer?  Good should be read as average-slightly above average. Also Brown averages less turnovers per game on 30% usage compared to 20% usage for Simmons.  Brown also offers *way* better floor spacing, which in itself gives his teammates open looks either at the basket or around the perimeter, and as I mentioned can pull-up from basically anywhere on the floor and score, as well as create his own shots.  I think Simmons is a very effective player, and I think his inability to shoot is overstated a bit, but that doesn't mean it isn't still a hinderance to his value.   It's ok to be a homer, but don't be delusional. Ben is absolutely not the clear better player right now, and it's perfectly reasonable for anyone to say Brown is better."
Al horford who thinks he is a pf plus embid.  I don't think draymond would work well with Ben simmons....  On offense.
Ben Simmons and Bam Adebayo  Think about it they are basically the same player but Simmons is a better passer
Ben Simmons should join both the Dunk contest and the 3 pt contest.  I really just want to see him in the 3 pt contest haha
Imagine trading James Harden and not getting at least Ben Simmons back. Then imagine trading James Harden and not getting Jarrett Allen either. That trade still confuses tf out of me
Ben Simmons has been put on notice
Ben Simmons over Rudy... and Jamal Murray?? This list is a joke
Ben Simmons does this ALL the time watch him when he catches an outlet pass. swear to god he's traveling 9/10 times  i also don't care if it has no impact on the play.
"It‚Äôs just a joke about LeBron averaging 27/7/7 for his career but having never had a 27/7/7 game.   I like Ben Simmons a whole lot. He isn‚Äôt the next LeBron but, yeah, who the hell is?"
Because the Sixers having a worse defensive rating than the Jazz despite having Ben Simmons (apparently better on defense than Rudy Gobert) AND another top 5 defensive player would be too comically bad of a take even for nba.com
"&gt;What a dogshit take on that first part. Harden is a top 5 player in this league, so no shit you trade Simmons for him  Tell that to Sixers fans who were crying that he would disturb team chemistry. also that ben will develop into a better player (hint: he most likely won't)"
"This is a great one, I was trying to think of one for Klay since he‚Äôs so good at a couple things while being limited elsewhere, my first thought was Ben Simmons but they are both good defenders, so derozan might be the best"
Ben Simmons robbed
"Most likely Gobert wins this award. And the reason to me is simple: they have the top defense (or close enough it changes often) and he is by far their best defender. But moreso than that they have been the best team in the NBA most of the year and have a good chance at being the number one seed in the East, while having absolutely no chance at getting MVP for anyone on their team.   The Sixers have Embiid and if we finish top two in the East and he continues his torrid pace he will receive serious consideration for MVP. I think voters will want to reward the Jazz for their amazing season and this makes the most sense. Gobert, Simmons and imo Embiid (not sure why he's not mentioned over defensive stalwart, Jamal Murray) all have a very good claim to the title this year. But two of those guys play on the same team and to this point their defense still isn't as good as the Jazz's.   Ben might deserve to be number one on this Ladder but he isn't the leader for the actual award."
Karl Anthony Towns or Ben Simmons.
Im saying this: the best nba defenses have an elite rim protector and can get by without a defensive wing like Simmons. Joel is the engine of the offense and defense. Joel provides the defense that ben cannot and does not do.
Ben Simmons and Kyrie Irving
&gt; Go check on any sites how star players perfoms when they are guarded by Ben Simmons. It's not only Net Ratings  Show me. Provide me a link
"&gt; Damn that‚Äôs a lot of nonsense you replied with  Whatever you say man  &gt;Again, Embiid is great no doubt, but he isn‚Äôt even playing much defense this season because he‚Äôs had to focus on being sometimes our sole offensive option on a given night.  That's not true because morey properly identified the weaknesses of the Sixers and fixed it. Ben is barely the third best defensive player not he team behind thybulle and Joel.   &gt;Yes that statement is based on what happens on the court.  The problem is you don't back up anything you are syaing/, you realize this right? According to RAPTOR, PIPM, RPM, RAPM (requires 250 games), guess who leads ben ''''''''DPOY''''''' Simmons sizably by every single metric? Joel embiid  &gt;He sometimes only guards them for one half then chills because it‚Äôs the regular season and we usually win these games without him going crazy for two halves (think load management defensively)   You two discussed this together?  &gt;His versatility and perimeter defense is unmatched by anyone in the league  Lol get this through your head: rim protection trumps being able to switch on the perimeter and guard a pick n roll (which results with Joel doing the actual heavy lifting).  &gt;no ones even close to what he can do  Sixers fans have to be absolutely delusional to believe this, right?. Anyways, there are many players that do what ben does (covington, draymond, kahwi when his offensive load is smaller). I would be made as well if my star point guard couldn't make a shot outside the paint then I might get defensive over it and lie about his defense to justify it in my mind. Actually I wouldn't' do that because im not a moron"
Are you dumb? please tell me you're drunk? You think that guarding is not included in defense??? Please stop that shit right now. Go check on any sites how star players perfoms when they are guarded by Ben Simmons. It's not only Net Ratings
"We're starting seth curry and the corpse of danny green. As much as I love the team's current composition, team defense is all five players. And neither of those guys can stop players from driving at this point in their careers. Plus fast break defense against quick players has been atrocious with everyone outside of ben simmons and thybulle."
"Who are they gonna get that's better, though?   Even considering throwing in Adams's contract, you're looking at a real small amount of ""players that make a ton of money and are tradeable."" Chris Paul? Ben Simmons? Kemba Walker?   Seems like they're gonna have to back the Brinks truck up, or punt completely on this season by trading for bad contracts and picks, which feels antithetical to where they are in their development."
"Zion is also not a guy defenses can sag off of, like they do players like Ben Simmons.  If you give Zion a runway he's going to make you pay."
"Ben Simmons is the definition of a player where the stats don't tell the story. As a die-hard sixers fan, earlier this season, I was inclined to agree that he hadn't shown improvement, but my god.   He's become the best defender in the NBA (maybe besides Gobert, but he's more versatile), and with his aggressive offense he really just becomes a dominant. Ever since he was almost dealt to Houston for Harden, he's been playing with a chip on his shoulder, and my god is he so good."
You got to put some respect on the name. That is perennial ROY candidate Ben Simmons.
"It would honestly be pretty hilarious seeing a second competition for each event with players that aren‚Äôt great at it.  3PT contest with Ben Simmons, Skills challenge with Tacko Fall, Dunk Competition with Steph Curry."
Ben simmons
"Anything on bleacher report/ house of highlights comments on Instagram, they genuinely think Ben Simmons is the worst player of all time."
&gt;Brown is a much better scorer and spaces the floor better.  Ben Simmons 3pt% on his last 3: 100%  Jaylen Brown 3pt% on his last 3: 0%  checkmate
"&gt;A common criticism of Ben has been his lack of improvement since entering the league, but in the last month its seemed like he's really taken a step forward.  Having a good month does not mean a player has taken a step forward. All players have good months and bad months relative their longer term performance.  For example, Simmons put up 22/9/8 on 65% TS last January."
All my friends think that ‚ÄúBen Simmons fucking sucks.‚Äù
"Plus there are TONS of other players who are good enough to be all stars like: Jason Tatum, Zion Williamson, ja morant, jaylen brown, devin booker, donavan Mitchell, Paul George, SGA, deaaron fox, jimmy butler, Kyle Lowry, khris middleton, Jamal Murray, KAT, bam adebayo, jrue holiday, Julius randle, domantas sabonis, Brandon Ingram, cj McCollum, klay thompson, demar derozan, Bradley Beal, Ben Simmons, Rudy gobert, Jerami Grant, Christian wood, Fred vanleet, kristaps porzingis, Zach Lavine,  nikola vucevic, d‚Äôanglo Russell, Andre Drummond, Gordon Hayward, Pascal Siakam, Collin sexton, mike Conley, this is not including the guys you said. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs ever been this many players with a legit chance of making the all star game ever."
"Ben Simmons, the guy who guards your wings, wasn't playing."
Magic Johnson is a worse Ben Simmons and would be a damn near role player in today's game
"Generally speaking a Point Guard is one of the smallest people on the court and rely on shooting to score more than drives/layups while a Power Forward is the opposite and is usually one of the tallest on the court and scores mostly off getting to the hoop and getting a layup or dunk. Ben Simmons is listed as a PG but plays like a PF which is why it‚Äôs weird for him to be at the 1.   Some players can switch positions, like a SG and PG are pretty similar except the PG brings the ball up and sets up plays. But for the most part labeling players with a number/position is just to suit how they play the game and match their skill set, also depends on how the team wants to run the offense. Lastly some players like LeBron are position-less and can play anywhere the offense needs"
Ben simmons probably has that record
Let's see Ben Simmons or late round picks...Yeah I think they easily lost the trade for at least the next 3 years.

"Id get Curry over Magic because much better spacing, but saying it's 'brainless' is stupid. Magic was a capable 3pt shooter when he adjusted to the changing league and worked on it later in his career  Wait, hope Im not wrong, but weren't you the dude who said Magic Johnson was a 'worse Ben Simmons' the other day?"
"That‚Äôs because Steph is a lockdown defender, he makes Ben Simmons look like a defensive liability"
I see Ben Simmons was so far upper left he‚Äôs off the chart
"Sure, if you're comparing him to like Jokic, Plumlee is a phenomenal athlete. But overall he's nothing special. He plays Center *because* he's so limited athletically. So you can't just compare him to other Centers. Lots of guys about the same size play more athletically demanding positions because they're faster, quicker, more agile and explosive.  Just to name a few -- Ben Simmons, Embiid, Durant, Giannis, AD, Ayton, KAT, Jonathan Isaac, Myles Turner, Michael Porter are all about the same size as Plumlee and way more athletic in every way"
Ben Simmons is like Bizarro Kobe
"Regardless of ""Like"" or ""Light,"" I understood what Chuck was saying, but still, it essentially came down to comparing early aughts Kob' vs. current Ben Simmons, which looks bad."
This season who‚Äôs better Ben Simmons or Chris Paul
I actually agree with shaq here lol. Charles take is in reference to how dominant Joel is and how shaq was. But the relation from kobe to simmons is kinda disrespectful esp when Ben can't even shoot. Kobe could do it all by 2003.
"Simmons is definitely the best on the list, but playing with Embiid doesn‚Äôt hurt him by any means. Embiid is a much better shooter than your average center, especially from mid-range, so the spacing he provides is actually good for a 5. Simmons definitely isn‚Äôt *adding* 2 APG by losing the best scorer on the team either.   And Ben isn‚Äôt a shot creator. He gets a lot of his scoring opportunities in transition. It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs losing scoring opportunities in the half court by feeding the ball to Embiid. In fact, having one of the best rim protectors in the league to get stops actually helps Simmons get out in transition where he‚Äôs at his best offensively."
"I would probably take Fox over Ben Simmons but it's debatable. I think Donovan Mitchell, though, is clearly the best player from that draft."
Zion was hyped but he wasn't the best prospect in a long time. Ben Simmons might be the last high schooler to feel like a guarantee. Zion had question marks because of the competition he played in high school.  Emoni Bates is even more of a lock than Ben Simmons was.
Lol.  Simmons can guard 1-5.  As has been pointed out.  He spoke the truth.  You don‚Äôt get to gatekeep What centers count to you.  Rudy is as pure a 5 in the league.  Ben guarded him.  Fact.
There are a bunch of players drafted 25th and below in the last 7-10 years that are better than Ben Simmons. Hit on even one of them and you're in a good spot. Hit on two or more and you're a contender.
"honestly when you're talking the elite of elite superstars in this league, none of them can guard each other 1 on 1.  not even your elite defenders can guard the best offensive players 1 on 1. when we see in a game someone like ben simmons ""locking up"" a guy, it's nowhere near him doing it by himself. he has help from the weakside, he has help from the next man over. even when you're on an island and iso'd on one side of the court, you still have help on your backside.  so honestly in this question is kinda silly. it'd be whoever gets the ball first. fg% would be in the 80%+"
I wish this was Ben Simmons.
"Yes. I never said that he was bad at that. In fact he‚Äôs probably the best in the league at the rim. All I‚Äôm saying is Ben is better at a certain aspect of defence, a style that‚Äôs more conducive to guards and some forwards.   I think I‚Äôve been misunderstood due to grammar. I meant that gobert can‚Äôt guard players the same way that Simmons can. Not that gobert can‚Äôt defend against Simmons. You wouldn‚Äôt want gobert 1 on 1 with someone like Kyrie, conversely you wouldn‚Äôt want  Simmons trying to protect the rim."
Can we put an end to Ben Simmons slander
"so... you do agree gobert defended him well in the paint 1v1, where it matters with ben simmons?"
"This was as bad a matchup as possible for us. Especially when we didn‚Äôt have a center that could pick and pop. WCS and Boban set screens and then have to roll right into Embiid. Simmons does a good job of staying with Luka and everything gets clogged.   If we have a center that can pop (KP) then it opens everything up for our wings to cut and for Luka to have more space in the paint. This is why KP torched them last time we played. He gets open shot after open shot when Embiid sinks into the paint.  Ben has historically slowed Luka down, but last night was never going to be a good game for Luka with the center rotation we have."
"NCAA has been developing players for free?   More like a take and give, and recently it's more of a take than a give. Players that stayed for 3 years, or 4, developed into ready-NBA talent.   What is a coach gonna do for a 1 and done? Other than teach finances, those coaches did nothing for the players' development. Ben Simmons was a perfect example of time wasted at college.   The G league could replace college basketballs popularity, and instead pair rookies with g league vets. College is an expensive daycare unless you're actually going to class."
"Bro you literally just said ""I can show you more than 2 buckets Luka made on Simmons""but he only made 3, these were 2 highlight buckets Ben got on Luka"
send Ben Simmons to NOLA &amp; then back to Philly
Ben Simmons would score on drives so much easier if he shot threes at even 30%. Players have to at least respect Giannis shooting a three. They can play off of Simmons
More than likely entirely in the paint or at the rim. Ben Simmons rarely shoots jumpers and never shoots 3s.
"It doesn't matter if they play him like Ben Simmons.  Interestingly, the best defenses against him (2020 Heat and 2019 Raptors) didn't play very far off him, they just relied on team defense to clog the paint like fuck.  What Giannis needs is to be able to consistently score outside of the paint. I don't even think he needs a three point shot. If he can implement a solid midrange game he'll be solid. Even a float game could help him tremendously."
BEN SIMMONS IS PUTTING YOUR MVP IN SOLITARY
Could‚Äôve had Ben Simmons
"Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, Ben Simmons"
turns out this topic has been [explored before after all](https://pickandroll.com.au/p/evolution-ben-simmons-accent)
Lol.  I like how you're asking hypothetical questions like you can't just watch the game and find out.  The Sixers went small and played fast so they could force Gobert away from the rim and force more individual mismatches with Harris and Simmons attacking much smaller players.   That works to a point because it makes our defense less effective but it also means that you lose the game because small ball no defense doesn't work so well against a team that has a better small ball offensive lineup.   Hence why Jordan Clarkson gets 40 points off the bench.  Ben can't guard literally everybody.
I can't think of another player that talks themselves up as much as Ben Simmons does.
Ben Simmons has been by all accounts working on his 3 in practice for /years/ at some point you just gotta try. There are intangibles you can only pick up from trying stuff in-game. It‚Äôs why we beg for promising rookies to get played more.
It‚Äôs not that simple. Giannis taking threes make people at the very least semi-respect his shot and stay on him at the line. If he didn‚Äôt they‚Äôd play him like he is Ben Simmons.
"Ben Simmons is an elite defender, but he‚Äôs not an elite player."
This steal by Ben Simmons against WCS in last night‚Äôs Dallas game was hilarious. Like he turned on sneak mode.  At 1:04 in the highlights:  https://youtu.be/DnUAxNDb43I
Ben Simmons does not watch the Utah Jazz.

"Ok I‚Äôve asked this question before and it still hasn‚Äôt been answered. When Jokic dropped 40 on him, a lot of y‚Äôall said Rudy is better as a help defender. So if he only guarded Simmons (who can only take layups) 7 times, wtf was he doing the rest of the game that let Ben drop 42? Guarding Dwight from mid?"
*Ben Simmons has entered the chat.*
Ben Simmons has hit a three before.
Ben Simmons is literally behind fat James Harden at the ability to guard 1-5.   https://twitter.com/The_BBall_Index/status/1364040806726660104?s=19
"Let‚Äôs not pretend that defending Ben Simmons on the perimeter is an achievement. Stoping him at the rim, which is goberts specialty, is the challenge with Simmons. It‚Äôs harder to guard mark gasol on the perimeter than Simmons!"
Stats show the clearest picture esp when you use all of them. What stats dont show is how insane he is on defense tbh but they also dont show how his spacing still hurts joel alot. Joel is playing with a guy who doesnt shoot in ben.. Another guy who cant shoot in thyb and a guy that can shoot but has a super slow release in curry. 2 of those 3 guys start with joel... So now teams know ben wont shoot and know curry has a slow release so when they double joel and the entire team over plays joel and his size they can sway off ben and when joel passes it out they can easily get back on defense to cover everyone because nobody was defending ben and people can sway off curry as well because of his release.  &amp;#x200B;  Ben simmons is a top 5 defender in the nba but he has a guy in Joel literally covering up the entire paint area allowing him to not fear guys blowing by him so he can cheat up. Ben is the best peremiter defender in the NBA because of this but joel is the all around better team defender by alot. I am a sixers fan but neither guy is better on defense over gobert. Gobert is and has been the best defensive player in the nba every year for about 3 plus seasons. Giannis won it while not being nearly as good a defender as gobert. The nba defensive logic is hilarious
Hey at least he ain‚Äôt scared like Ben Simmons lol
"Ya I guess so. I think it‚Äôs just a really obvious and thus easy to choose reason. It‚Äôs undeniable that being able to shoot &gt; not being able to shoot. So this is why people are quick to criticize Adam‚Äôs for it, or Ben Simmons even."
"&gt; Gobert can‚Äôt stick with a man like Simmons  During the most recent Sixers v Jazz game, Ben shot 3/7 when his primary defender was Gobert. His 1v1 defense is not nearly as bad as people think"
Lmao 7 picks &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ben fucking Simmons
Lmao is this a fucking joke? Ben Simmons isn't even the best defensive player on his own team
"Exactly. It's a Giannis vs Ben Simmons type situation, and I'd rather be Giannis than Ben"
"Are you saying Ben Simmons is a negative on offense then?  He definitely contributes on that side of the floor even though he can‚Äôt shoot cmon man.  But if your point is that his lack of shooting is exploitable, then the same can definitely be said about traes defense.  Teams exploit it damn near every game."
"&gt;Then the Sixers are better without Ben Simmons on defense. Thus, by your logic, he is not having a positive impact defensively on the Sixers  How many times do I have to explain this to you? The Sixers are an elite defense with Simmons on the floor. They are also an elite defense with him off the floor.    The Wizards are an average offense and average defense when Russ sits, and one of the worst offenses and defenses in the league when he plays."
"I was hoping you would‚Äôve thought this through a little more.   By that logic, every player on a poor offensive team/lineup isn‚Äôt having a positive impact. If you are comparing him to the Wizards without him specifically ...  Then the Sixers are better without Ben Simmons on defense. Thus, by your logic, he is not having a positive impact defensively on the Sixers ... what they are with him is irrelevant if it‚Äôs lower than what they are without him.   Same with Anthony Davis.   The Thunder have a 116 DRTG, which would be one of the worst in the league, when Lu Dort is on the court.  ... do you get it now?"
"Rudy is a rim protector (a really good one), simmons guards their best players, led the league in steals guarding some of the best in the league. The leagues offense outside the perimeter has changed dramatically and the defense hasn't caught up. Seth Curry's brother changed the league offensively in 2015, truth is Ben Simmons is too defense what Seth Curry's brother was too the leagues offense. Rudy is old school basketball defense ***BEN IS THE FUTURE***"
"As a Bucks fan, I‚Äôm unironically excited to see our games against the Sixers coming up. After Giannis called Simmons a ‚ÄúFucking baby,‚Äù I would like to think that Ben has been in the weight room Ben Affleck-Batman style ever since."
Oh you mean like [how the Sixers are better defensively without DPOY candidate Ben Simmons? ](https://www.nba.com/stats/team/1610612755/onoffcourt-summary/)  Gee it‚Äôs almost as if things like lineups and playing a lot of minutes with the bench affects stuff like that.   No one is saying he‚Äôs playing amazing on the year. Wizards fans are just saying he‚Äôs had positive impact on their recent slate of wins.   And I‚Äôm just saying the guy who was a +62 on off in a series where he shot 40% can actually be impactful and inefficient.
"This is why all this ‚Äúshooting 3s‚Äù and 16 PPG LUL narratives are so fucking dumb.  Like Ben is just as important to the offense as Embiid because he makes sure we are always taking a good shot, AND he is the equivalent of a shut down corner on D.  Most of those playoff series that we lost were due to open shooters bricking every shot they took.  Also I hate how the media only focuses on the offensive pairing of Embiid and Simmons while completely ignoring the fact that their defensive pairing could not be more perfect.  2 hyper athletic defenders that can both guard 1-5, yet one specializes in clamping on the perimeter and the other is a top 2 rim protector in the league.  Stop focusing on what players can do and start looking at what they can do.  Ben is literally 10/10 in every area of his game other then scoring, which he is still pretty darn good at when he needs to be."
Ben Simmons can't shoot and that holds merit cause Ben Simmons can't shoot
"I pointed out a couple months ago how idk how the Celtics really get that much better when Tatum comes back because they are still going to be an offense that relys way too much on mid range 2s.  They‚Äôre both great perimeter defenders but when your scoring comes at the cost of overall team efficiency I think that is a big reason why the team as a whole is struggling.  Ironically for Cs fans they need a player like Ben Simmons desperately, someone who can make sure that they‚Äôre always taking a good look every position, instead of defaulting to Brown and Tatum just playing 1 on 1."
"Unless they‚Äôre getting another rim protector for Looney there‚Äôs no reason to trade him. As for Draymond, why the fuck would they trade their facilitator that has great chemistry with Steph and Klay on top of being the heart of their defense? That team doesn‚Äôt work without Draymond since you‚Äôre not getting his defensive IQ and playmaking. You‚Äôd never get equal value for him since the only other player that‚Äôs closest to him is Ben Simmons and the 76ers have no reason to get Dray."
"[nba.com sixers are 4th, Miami is 9th separated by .8. ](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/defense/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1). I love your arbitrary rankings btw, Miami does not play 7 of the worst 25 defenders, get out of here. They play a lot of mediocre to bad defenders, but you‚Äôre completely overreacting trying to make bam look better. Also, it‚Äôs not like embiid doesn‚Äôt play with guys like korkmaz, curry, Milton, Scott and Maxey. Just like embiid plays with a couple a really good defenders, so does bam with butler and iggy.    &gt;Miami has a better fg% against and a better 3pt% against than Philly. And gives up less free throws. So the defense that gives up less % of makes, less % of 3s made, and puts their opponent on the line less is somehow worse according to you?   How dumb are you? It‚Äôs because Miami gives up way more 3s than the sixers. The sixers don‚Äôt give up many threes with embiid because they don‚Äôt have to help off of shooters because he can command the paint on his own. You do understand that 3 is worth more than 2 right? You genuinely seemed to have a hard time figuring out something that‚Äôs stupidly simple. Let me really dumb it down to your level. If team A gives up 100 2 point shots and the opponent makes 50% they allow 100 points over those 100 shots. If team B gives up 100 3 point shots and the opponent makes 40% they allow 120 points over the same amount of shots. Even though they have a whopping 10% better dfg%, they gave up a staggering 20 more points over the 100 possessions.   &gt;And I wanna reiterate that all of this is happening while Joel Embiid is an A+ defender and Ben Simmons is arguably the runner up for DPOY right now?  Yep, and if you go by clutch time, last 5 minutes in the a 5 point game, they have the best defensive rating in the league.   &gt;Get real, bro. Even using your preferred method looks excellent for Bam.   And another hilariously ignorant statement by your dumbass. Miami literally has a better defensive rating without bam on the court vs on the court. [(source)](https://www.nba.com/stats/team/1610612748/onoffcourt-advanced/). The same is obviously not true for embiid. Like every year, the sixers are better defensively with him on the court vs off it."
You‚Äôre fine with wasting Embiids prime?  He‚Äôs having one of the best seasons a center has ever had and his second best player is .....Ben Simmons. At least Giannis got Jrue and Middleton who are great defenders and shooters   Can‚Äôt wait for the playoffs
"Miami is 8th. Philly is 4th. They're separated by .010, which is nothing -- yet Philly has not one, but TWO supposed DPOY candidates on it? And doesn't employ 7 of the bottom 25 defenders in the NBA?  Miami has a better fg% against and a better 3pt% against than Philly. And gives up less free throws. So the defense that gives up less % of makes, less % of 3s made, and puts their opponent on the line less is somehow worse according to you? And I wanna reiterate that all of this is happening while Joel Embiid is an A+ defender and Ben Simmons is arguably the runner up for DPOY right now?  Get real, bro. Even using your preferred method looks excellent for Bam."
They should have taken the ben simmons deal. Is victor oladipo worth  2 2nd round picks. KP definitely has talent cavs were just so dysfunctional. Where is wood?
"You realize Jameer in his prime was a better offensive player than Ben Simmons, right? You realize Dwight also played with Hedo Turkoglu, who was a point-forward at like 6'10, could shoot, pass and run the offense. You realize he played with other great shooters like JJ Reddick and Rashard Lewis who was like 6'10 with a 7'3 wingspan."
I think Ben Simmons is the best option on KD in the league
Ben Simmons can't shoot and the Nets are gonna run them off the floor.
"&gt; Why would you be expecting this from him?  This discussion is about offensive gravity and Embiid has more of it with and without the ball because he can score from anywhere. Dwight never had that  &gt; Also, Embiid isn't playing DPOY level defense. That's Ben Simmons  They both are if you actually watch. Embiid might not be top 5 this year in votes because the narrative is about Ben, but he deserves it. He was a runner up in 2018 (his 2nd actual season) and will always be in the conversation. When was dwight ever the 2nd best offensive player in the league?"
"&gt; Prime Dwight catches the ball beyond the arc - do you even bother closing out?  Why would you be expecting this from him? Which big man during his time was expected to shoot 3s? Do you expect Shaq or Hakeem to be shooting 3s to consider them to have gravity? Unless you consider Embiid to have more gravity than Shaq or Hakeem.   Dwight was playing in a 4-out offense. You pass the ball to him, defense collapses and he passes out to his shooters.  Also, Embiid isn't playing DPOY level defense. That's Ben Simmons. I'll be surprised if Embiid even finishes top 5."
"I know you guys can‚Äôt honestly believe Kemba Walker is a better, or even more impactful, defender than Ben Simmons. Celtics flairs are just brain dead."
Going from the reputation of one of the worst shooters in the league is probably more accurate lol. He was never Ben Simmons bad.. it was his wonky mechanics and airballs getting all the highlights. He shot 38% last season on 1.5 less threes shot. He's at 39% this season.
"If I look at the 70 players who have played at least 1000 minutes this season, the top 15 in Def RAPTOR are:  Rudy Gobert, myles turner, Robert covington, Luguentz Dort, Fred Vanvleet, Nic Batum,  Kawhi Leonard, Giannis, Julius Randle, Bam adebayo , royce O'Neal, Justin holiday, Ben Simmons, Kelly oubre, DeAndre ayton  This is littered with players who are either great individual defenders, or at least do a great job playing a defensive role in a solid system (FVV, Julius Randle, for example)   Wiggins ranks 25th out of those 70 players for the record - so hes fine enough but I can't buy all this talk that hes elite on that end   Also fair to note that he is ranked 67th out of those 70 players in offensive RAPTOR , right behind Anthony Edwards. So there's that"
Ben Simmons. Dude can't guard anyone
"&gt;And had the worst record in the league and never sniffed the playoffs. Your point? We were talking about playoff teams both of them have played on.  He was a rookie and played 33 games...  My point is that you lied.   &gt;I'm not blamin him at all, those teams were trash, but no one is makin an actual effective argument detailing Embiid's playoff success because he has zilch.   Wow...  First of all, Embiid is a stretch 5 who shoots mid-range and 3s so naturally his FG% is going to be lower. This is why we use EFG% and TS%.  Second of all, he literally took the eventual champions to 7 games.  &gt;He shoots &lt;45% in the playoffs as a 7'0"" Center   Dude, are you just gonna continue to make shit up? TIL 45.9% &lt; 45%...   &gt;and hasn't show he can elevate his team in the playoffs like prime Dwight - yet.  I‚Äôm sure Dwight was elevating his team a ton with his 1.2 assists per game.  Embiid averages 2.9 apg in the playoffs btw, over twice as much.  &gt;He had Butler (the guy who took the Lakers to 6 games in the Finals) &amp; Simmons healthy one year and the furthest he got was the 2nd round, and that team was better than any Orlando team Dwight played with.  Yes, and they literally took the eventual champions to 7 games (which took a historical performance and a game winner by Kawhi for the Raptors to win).  &gt;Lol, disprove what I actually said then.  Gladly.   You said   &gt;Even if he didn't have Ben, getting swept by two 20 year olds and an allstar who's never won a playoff series before is laughable.  Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown were 22 and 23 years old, respectively, in that series, not ‚Äú20 years old.‚Äù"
"Not really. Defensive stats are skewed heavily by rotations and team defensive strength.  Ben Simmons is a top 10 defender in the league, but many defensive stats have Montrezl Harrell as statistically better because of his team/rotation. You cannot rely on any defensive stats for a ""general feel of things""."
Ben Simmons can shoot 3s üò§üò§üò§
Hopefully the guy gets rewarded with a few All-D‚Äôs.   The guy is playing like a 1st team All-D wing. Only guy that‚Äôs better guarding the perimeter is probably Ben Simmons (few players are tight around the same).
Are u gonna continue to be a dumbass and not mention that Ben Simmons who can clamp anyone's favorite player was out?
Ben simmons is a fucking bum
Ah yah Ben 2 points in a playoff game simmons. Definitely would have turned a sweep into a series yall win.
"On the one hand the Sixers absolutely need a PG to be true title contenders. Their best lineup, far and away, this season has been Shake-Seth-Ben-Tobias-Embiid, aka a lineup that doesn't have Danny Green and has another ball handler  But on the other hand, Ben Simmons has never lost a game to Kemba in his career"
"It‚Äôs not a terrible comparison, but it‚Äôs never gonna be totally right to compare Simmons to true PGs, he‚Äôs really a point forward. I think the labeling of Ben as a PG leads to some weird expectations of what he should be able to do, rather than celebrating his unique game. A Kidd or CP3 type is gonna run a ton of PnRs and kick out from there, Ben operates a lot more in the post as a passer a la LeBron, and faces up for scoring."
"Simmons is significantly better in the half court this season with a coach actually running plays. Brett Brown did not run plays, he preached a more free flowing offense and Ben for sure struggled in that setting where his lack of a jump shot was exploited. But Doc has made Ben into a much better initiator of the offense in the half court now that he is getting drawn up plays that maximize what he can do in the half court."
Agreed. I like TS% tbh. Closest thing to efficiency that we have. But zion is still better by almost 11 TS%.  Big reason why I crap on ben simmons a bit. He's surprisingly less efficient than you think - worse when you think how bad the sixers are in a half court setting which is crucial in the playoffs/last 2 minutes of a game.
&gt;Teams do not leave their center defending the rim while vuc stands on the perimeter. Just doesnt happen.  They help off him all the time. You can spend 5 min watching every 3 pointer he's taken this year and see this. [Here you go even enjoy](https://go.nba.com/i7kf). Just because they dont treat you like Ben Simmons playing 10 feet off you doesnt mean you provide floor spacing.   Ill give you his most recent game as an ex   [Blatantly treating him as a guy they are willing to let shoot no actual gravity](https://go.nba.com/sk18)   Same thing [Michael Carter Williams isnt nearly this big a threat on a drive to warrant this kind of attention they are just sagging off Vuc and letting him shoot because they dont care if he does](https://go.nba.com/nj95)  [transition 3 Collins closes out in the end but not exactly playing up on him like you see guys with real gravity get defended](https://go.nba.com/n4fc). Same idea as before [MCW driving in transition isnt nearly a big enough threat bigs have to be ready in the paint](https://go.nba.com/o1n2) coaching instructions are clearly close out if he does shoot it but that they arent afraid to let him shoot if he wants.   Not much to evaluate here [just a scramble type situaiton spot up 3 opening for Vuc](https://go.nba.com/yk4c)  And his last [3 pointer for that game same idea zero gravity just let him shoot](https://go.nba.com/eord). If he had actual gravity John Collins would be rotating off Aminu to prevent a Vuc shot and let Aminu shoot but he doesnt.   I picked this most recent game. You can pick whatever you want youll see the same point. The vast majority of the time he doesnt have gravity and cause defenses to bend or really respect his shot.
What if Ben Simmons could shoot?
My point is basic stats alone show lowry should be ahead of ben simmons fox etc. He should be just behind chris paul in terms of pure pgs. Lebron cp3 harden dame luka lowry in general list of top pgs
"His stats are already good to tell the story too, his stats a lone make him better than ben simmons. Lowrys stats are so goos theres a reason hes always an early round fantasy pick"
"I'm not sure if I am understanding correctly. First, I assume you are talking about Ben's rookie year, and not Jimmy's (he was on the bench in Chi-town and was not a top 10 pick). So assuming that's correct, I do give Ben credit for being top-2 in each of their playoff appearances- 2018, 2019, 2020. I would agree that there's an argument to be made that Butler was top 2 and not Simmons in 2019 (especially when Brett Brown put the ball in Butler's hands and sent Ben to the corner) but I was giving Simmons the benefit of the doubt of being top 2. Maybe you were confused by my second table (where I list players that have taken their teams to the conference finals). Before I caught my mistake, I had Embiid and Simmons down taking the Sixers to the conference finals in 2019 (which was really just the Conf. Semis). Maybe that is where you saw him down only once. And I have fixed that mistake so he should only be showing up on the first table."
No order btw  1. LeBron James 2. Kawhi Leonard 3. Anthony Davis 4. James Harden 5. Kevin Durant 6. Stephen Curry 7. Kyrie Irving 8. Paul  George 9. Damian Lillard 10. Joel Embiid 11. Nikola Jokic 12. Luka Doncic 13. Zion Williamson (yes that's right) 14. Chris Paul 15. Giannis  16. Rudy Gobert 17. Donovan Mitchell 18. Jimmy Butler 19. Jaylen Brown 20. Ben Simmons  maybe a healthy KP top 25
"Yeah, not sure what to do with that. Initially, I incorrectly gave Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons credit for leading the Sixers to the Conference Finals in 2019- when they really only went to the second round. So, based on that error, I had 25 players in the last 20 years-- which divided really cleanly in to 12.5% and a 1/8 chance of getting a player in the top ten who would take you the conference finals. Then, once people pointed out my mistake, I'm left with 23/200 players, which divides to 11.5% of the time... but saying you have a 1/8.695... chance to get such a player does not translate well. So I left it as ""roughly a 1/8 chance"" rather than get all precise (since this really isn't about exact precision, but more giving a rough idea of how often said outcome happened in the last 20 years). And it was fun. Too much work for me, but it makes me admire those who regularly put out top notch OC such as  [u/ZandrickEllison](https://www.reddit.com/user/ZandrickEllison/) and others."
Same story with the early Ben Simmons hate
"It's not even a better trade package than the one Houston *turned down*.  Simmons Thybulle and 2 FRPs blows this offer out of the water. Harris and Barton are not good contracts. So it's MPJ, one bad FRP, one second and one that likely won't be great. That's not a great return. Certainly MPJ is not as good as Ben Simmons for 5 years and Thybulle, and the rest is a wash at best.  Now you may not like picks personally, but they do have currency in the league, and it's understandable why Stone decided to take them."
Ben Simmons
"Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons and Bam Adebayo. my opinion is not biased what so ever  In all seriousness though they will lock you up and throw way the key"
"This sub can be so inconsistent. One guy gets downvoted into oblivion for misusing obscure internet slang, but this person implying that three-point shooting is the one differentiator between Ben Simmons and LeBron James is karma-neutral? What is happening?"
You forgot to mention that Ben Simmons is shooting 100% from 3 when the shot goes in though.
"And Ben Simmons has averaged 21 PPG a month multiple times, but still averages 16 a season. I meant 3 point shooter too."
Dwight Howard[4] has more 3s than Ben Simmons[2]
This just in: u/vastoctopus has made more shit posts this year than Ben Simmons
my fucking grandma could make more threes than ben simmons
Heat LeBron was a better run protector and finisher than this hypothetical Ben Simmons.  Don‚Äôt disrespect the King üò§
He did that in 1 game.... lonZo always will make more 3s than Ben Simmons...
Klay Thompson is overrated. Even Ben Simmons made more threes than him this year.
I think the real story everyone is missing. Ben Simmons has hit more 3s than Klay Thompson this year.
"All these nephews are so obsessed with advanced stats now... the numbers might say lonzo ball has made more threes this year than Ben Simmons, but have you watched any games? How do we know he's actually made more threes? I bet if you gave both of them the eye test, ben Simmons makes way more threes, maybe even twice as many threes as Lonzo Ball."
"Doesn't nearly every player have more 3's than Ben Simmons? Pretty sure he has one made three this year.  Edit: nvm, he has 2!!"
Ive made more threes than Ben Simmons
Steph Curry has missed more threes than Ben Simmons. Simmons &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Curry.
"&gt;Maxey  Maxey wasn't the problem for me (and many other fans), it was Simmons. I know some fans wanted to trade Simmons for Harden, but I'd say more fans were hesitant because of Simmons and the ones who wanted to trade Simmons for Harden were likely OK with including Maxey as well if it came to it.  And not including Simmons wasn't about Harden being good enough or not, it was more about him possibly being a two years and gone type of situation at the expense of giving up what could be a decade of Ben Simmons."
Ben Simmons - 03      Had to say it before Celtics fans did
"This is his first half of a season playing at a superstar level. I get the similarities in style of play, but let‚Äôs wait till the end of the year to hail him as the next Hakeem.  But then again, i know how insistent this sub is on anointing every new player as an All-Timer based on a limited sample size of games. I understand this is supposed to be a positive complement to Embiid, but it‚Äôs also disrespectful to Hakeem, who was on a whole nother level for a more consistent period of time.  It‚Äôs kinda similar to when a few weeks ago some folks on here argued Ben Simmons was essentially ‚ÄòMagic Johnson but with better defense.‚Äô"
"Khris Middleton is a better second option than Jamal Murray, and Ben Simmons isn't the Sixers second option, Tobi Harris is, and Middleton is better than him"
"I would disagree. They are good but like Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid and Tobias Harris could take that cake."
"Too bad Simmons lazy ass couldn‚Äôt transform like Embiid, into a super star. It‚Äôs been long enough he needs to learn to shoot. How can you give be a pro abs not work on your game, to learn to shoot? Tells me he‚Äôs not taking it serious. The 76ers we‚Äôre supposed to be the next Kobe and shaq, but Embiid got tried waiting for Simmons, to become a legit super star, so he evolved into the best center and made Ben his side kick"

"Tell me who else is putting up 34/10/4 on 63TS while playing all NBA defense. Against 3 top defenders like Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons and Embiid."
"Even if he's fully healthy there are definitely 15 players better  LeBron, KD, Steph, harden, Kawhi, Giannis, Doncic, Jokic, embiid, Lillard, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen brown, Bradley Beal, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Ben Simmons, Booker"
"I'm from Melbourne, Australia. We have Kyrie, Ben Simmons and Andrew Bogart. Most number 1 draft picks from any city."
"&gt;But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs within any teams control to stop speculation of trades.  Ever notice how you don't actually hear about any Celtics players being involved in trade talks? The Celtics are involved, but they don't discuss who they're planning to actually trade. Contrast that with Ben Simmons and Maxey for the 76ers.   There is absolutely a benefit to controlling the narrative about your trade talks.   &gt; The idea that Ainge here is an anonymous source vaguely contradicting Ainge‚Äôs public statements in order to do something  In this case it is in order to maintain a reputation, both among fans and other GMs. This source came from inside the Celtics FO. It is designed to benefit the Celtics. It isn't a conspiracy, it is how the game is played. The media aren't spies with bugs in every front office wire tapping phone calls. They get told this stuff by front offices.   &gt;Ainge valued Brown and/or Tatum (and/or the picks the Celtics used to draft them) with other players and draft assets, over a trial run with some very disgruntled star.  That may ultimately be true, but it also makes the celtics look good if they were investigating potential trades for a superstar when a trade for that super star looks like it was a really good choice for another team."
"Lotta things wrong with this list, but most of all it seems that some people on this sub really don't respect Magic Johnson  I had people telling me that he gets no credit for his any of his rings since he 'never won without Kareem', so Curry and a lotta other legends gotta be higher than him. Some people said he's a 'worse Ben Simmons'. A lot of people genuinely think he and other 80s players would be bums today so that's why modern guys are inherently better &amp; higher on the list than Magic, Bird, etc."
"Hope you don't mind, but Ben Simmons needs to be removed from the second table as he only made it to the Conference Semis in 2019!"
"The moment that sold me on Ben Simmons was when the Sixers were up in a playoff game against the Celtics, and he had the ball with a few seconds left ... he was so petrified of going to the FT line that he took an ill advised shot instead of being intentionally fouled, bricked it, and then proceeded to lose the game."

Ben Simmons
"My friend doesn't have reddit but loves your chart when I shared it with him. He's a diehard Sixers fan, care to share stats on Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons? (He's ecstatic about Embiid's stats)"
"Reminds me a lot of Ben Simmons. There's plenty of ways to question his value, but anyone watching the team will tell you they're essential to the teams success."
"Overall, I think I would take Melo because I think his upside is higher.  He is going to put on some pounds, its only natural.  Therefore, if his defense gets better and his shot improves, he can be a top 10 player for sure.  From what I have seen, his is a willing defender and shooter so I am sure he will improve on both sides.  However, he is still somewhat of a project.  If he doesn't improve, he is Ben Simmons minus the defense.  I do have confident that Ball will get better on both sides.  Ja is more of an offense threat, but I don't see his defense ever getting past par.  I am not sure how much weight he can really put on either.  He just seems like a naturally skinny dude.  And getting bigger might even slow down his game, so I am not sure about Ja's future to be honest.  I am sure he will be a good player for a long time, but I see him as to being much closer to his ceiling already as compared to Ball."
"The east was pretty weak compared to this year imo. Philadelphia without Ben Simmons and Toronto were not very great teams. But yes in terms of the playoffs assuming health, this celtics team plus Barnes would be better than last year in the playoffs."
Ben Simmons just needs to switch hands and Morey will change his school of thought again

"**TEAM DRJISFTW**  Fans are excited when the Dr. Jisftw used his vast medical fortune to buy an expansion team. Moreover, Damian Lillard fans are excited that the roster appears well-suited to his particular game, particularly in regards to 3+D wings in Royce O'Neal and Mikal Bridges. Due to the owner's flair, the team is slated to join the Eastern Conference.  Armed with Ben Simmons (well known defender) and those two (underrated defenders), the lineup immediately clicks together and becomes a top 10 defensive unit. Lillard thrives as a result, averaging 25-8 and emerging as a potential MVP candidate due to the stats and the team record, as the group vaults up to the # 4 seed in their first year of existence.  That said, the Eastern Conference is no joke this year, leading to a very difficult matchup with # 1 seeded Brooklyn in round two. As expected, Damian Lillard is a monster in the series, averaging 33 points per game. The team trades punches and trades wins with Brooklyn all series long, going down to the wire tied 3-3 headed into Game 7.  Unfortunately, the game is marred by some shaky officiating, as the refs call quite a few fouls on Dr. J's wings for their physical defense. James Harden ends the game going 12-14 from the FT line, which may be the difference in their 109-105 win. The team goes home salty and disappointed, but confident that they can contend with the best of the best down the road."
"**TEAM (NOT CURSED) ORLANDO MAGIC**  Workaholic Steve Clifford spends a few extra hours in his basement every night, tinkering with a time machine that allows his team to play 2020-21 completely healthy.  Armed with a solid core that went 42-40 in the past, coupled with rising young talent in Markelle Fultz and Jon Isaac, the Magic looked well suited to return to the playoff field. The up-and-down shooting continues to plague their upside, but their strong defensive play allows the group to finish with a 45-37 record and the # 6 seed out East.  In the playoffs, the Magic match up against Philadelphia (who drops to # 3 by the time the playoffs roll around.) Orlando gives a good fight, but Ben Simmons stymies his old teammate Fultz and leaves the Magic a little too offensively challenged to get over the hump. The Magic go home, 4-2."
"PG: Damian Lillard  SG: Royce O'Neale  SF: Mikal Bridges  PF: Ben Simmons  C: Nicola Vucevic   Is this a championship contender? It's an odd ""Big-3"" of Dame/Ben/Vooch, but Vooch provides spacing for Ben to work in the interior. Dame and Vooch aren't the best defenders but you're surrounding them with two 3&amp;D guys and one of the best defenders in the league right now."
"Sixers, despite three straight shot clock violations, made a wicked comeback that game. Ben Simmons would have blocked that shot on Kawhi and who knows what would have happened."
I replied elsewhere with a still of Joel and Kawhi right before the shot left Kawhi's hands. Look at how Joel barely left his feet. Ben Simmons would have had it. And then Joel had the nerve to cry. Fuck him.
"[https://sixerswire.usatoday.com/2019/05/12/watch-kawhi-leonard-buzzer-beater-takes-4-bounces-eliminates-76ers/](https://sixerswire.usatoday.com/2019/05/12/watch-kawhi-leonard-buzzer-beater-takes-4-bounces-eliminates-76ers/)  Take a look at that photo. LOOK AT IT. Joel BARELY leaves his feet to defend that shot. Of those final 4 seconds, Ben Simmons, who had enough vert and height to block the shot, was on him for 3.5 seconds, but Embiid stepped in last second, botched the defense, and pretty much is the reason why the sixers lost.  Not to mention the whole team let Kawhi walk all over them all series, with that being the nail in the coffin. Thanks for the lazy defense Joel, and thanks for the shit coaching, Brett Clown. I hope you never coach an NBA game again."
"Ben Simmons 2.0, or 1.0"
poor man's Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons
"Lebron is one of the 10 greatest defenders ever imo. Simmons last 2 years just entered top 5 defender in the league discussion.   Lebron was just as good on the ball but his help defense, IQ, can guard (true) bigs better, quarterbacking the defense with communication and knowing other offenses plays blows Ben out of the water"
"""I like Ben Simmons he's like my dog Rufus, he does things"" Sorry, the guy has no understanding of the intricacies of the game. Why would he? He literally never played on a team and had a coach explain Xs and Os to him"
Is Ben Simmons the only notable Ben in the NBA? I notice he gets first name treatment a lot despite not having an uncommon first name.
"Voter fatigue is real. I do think he is more impactful on defense but Ben Simmons have been good enough to make it an argument and because of that, they will give it to Ben. The only way to win awards more than 3 times is to be so good that the gap is too much for any narrative to close."
"He hasent Ben that hated, it just Simmons that way on this sub"
Klutch guerilla marketing campaign. Some powerful people need Ben Simmons to win DPOY this year for... reasons.
Cp3&gt;ben simmons
"Covington and then Ben Simmons? Currently in the NBA perimeter players are more important defenders that's why Ben Simmons is the leading pick for DPOY. He wouldn't be a DPOTY candidate if he didn't have better defenders on his team, it would go to Gobert easily. Embiid deserves MVP right now, his team has a better record."
"If Lonzo can work his 3 up to 40%, there's no physical reason Ben Simmons can't get to 35% if he'd just get out of his own head."
Ben this year is better and a better player overall.  He‚Äôs found a way to be active and contribute without dominating the ball on offense.  On defense he‚Äôs a level up from Jrue and on the boards he‚Äôs two levels up.  If you want to give it to Jrue on superior playoff resume that‚Äôs fine but you saw the sixers get smoked last year in Ben‚Äôs absence and the Pellies never made a big splash there anyway.  Simmons is my guy.
Ben Simmons. Dude can guard 1-5
"But then free throws should be for more than one point xD so it will bring balance for Ben Simmons, no 3 point shooter and poor free throws shooter."
thybulle not top 5.  ben simmons is a PG.
"I mean he can shoot well enough for now, he's not Ben Simmons. I have faith his J gets to be league average at worst"
Only they didn‚Äôt.  I can‚Äôt find full stats for series but Ben was primary on him after game 1.    https://ca.nba.com/news/nba-playoffs-2019-ben-simmons-76ers-slow-down-kawhi-leonard-raptors/m1ls8ye30eu41hxmedoe2ftbu  found this after game 2.
"&gt;This is in part a direct result of the premium on shooting: the guys who are great drivers and finishers but can't shoot from deep don't really have a place in the league anymore.  That's just not true didn't we all just witness [Jimmy Butler put up 40 in the Finals without making a 3.](https://www.nba.com/news/jimmy-butler-triple-double-finals) Jimmy was the first player to do that since Shaq did it in 2002. I would argue that there are definitely places for those guys in the league, guys like Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, and Giannis Antetokounmpo have the ability to score but they usually just look and play differently in this area. In this area, those guys have to be a physically dominant point forward type players and are be able to play bully ball in the post and run freely and physically dominant opponents in the halfcourt, or else it's much harder for them to exist. Zion is another good example of this because although he can sometimes shoot the three, he prefers to score mostly in the paint. Another key point to this is being a good free-throw shooter which why I would argue Jimmy Butler is the most prominent and best prototype of this type of scorer in the NBA.   The other type of player that can thrive nowadays without being able to shoot from deep, is a guard, particularly one who is either incredibly athletic and/or skilled whose best skill is usually their vision and passing rather than their ability to score (although most of these players can and do have multiple ways to score but are generally pass-first point guards). Guards like De'Aaron Fox, Ja Morant, Russell Westbrook, Luka Doncic, and to a lesser extent Demar Derozan. As I mentioned before these guards with the exception of Derozan (although he has become a much better playmaker in his Spurs era) are pass-first guards which means that they look to make plays and find their teammates before scoring. It's also to note that when most of these guards do score they score either in the paint or the mid-range because they either have the physical strength like Luka does to body other players and easily get to the paint or the free-throw line or they have the handles, athleticism and quickness like Fox, Morant, and Westbrook do to blow pass their opponents to finish at the rim."
"That's why Danny Green was so underrated by fans. Kawhi was relegated to picking up some secondary player and Green got the primary matchup almost every time and killed it.  Yeah he's a step slower but here we go again with Ben Simmons getting maximum love -- another Green teammate whose defense gets all the shine. And Embiid is incredible too, probably even more impactful than old Duncan."
"Let‚Äôs say the Sixers lose in the ECF this season, and the Wolves pick conveys to the Warriors at #4. If the Warriors offer Wiggins, Poole, 2021 #4, 2022 1st, 2024 1st, 2026 1st for Ben Simmons and Seth Curry, do the Sixers pick up the phone or hang up?"
omg he learned the ben simmons/embiid package!? wait...
"&gt; perennial all-star but with very few all NBA teams  That's just how it works out sometimes. Paul Pierce had 10 All-Star/4 All-NBA. Vince Carter had 8/2, Ray Allen had 10/2.   He might make it this year, but he's not a sure thing. Harden, Curry, Dame, Luka, Ben Simmons are all likely. He's in the mix with players like Beal, Lavine, Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Jaylen Brown. Russ won't make it this year, so that frees up a spot."
Googled your man devin. He averages 0 points 0 assists 0 steals and 0 blocks.  Averaged .7 rebounds in 7 games tho.  Definitely could call Ben Simmons overrated.  For sure.
"People overvalue ""1st round picks"" and especially pick-swaps.    The most probable scenario is that half the swaps don't convey, 2 of the three unprotected picks are late 20s, and then hopefully last three picks are of some value assuming the Nets collapse due to injuries and aging.  Best case scenario is a replication of Nets/Celtics trade, but most likely scenario is that the Rockets manage find draft an Aron Aflallo and maybe one all-star half a decade from now.  Ben Simmons alone is worth more than that."
Oh I forgot the part where Ben Simmons was 7‚Äô0 300 pounds
"Both he and his mother told me he is 7‚Äô1, he is only listed as 6‚Äô10 on the site though. Regardless youre having conversations with yourself, i never said he said Ben Simmons was overrated, just that I would ask, also, literally anyone can determine that someone is overrated, you dont need to be an all nba player to do that. Devin Simmons, Huntingdon Basketball because you clearly have a stick up your butt"
"You don‚Äôt know either of those claims.  I do know his 6‚Äô9‚Äù friend and 7‚Äô1‚Äù friend are two tall ass dudes clocking into a normal job.   Man said college but no name or team, future grocery bagger that can‚Äôt fit in a normal car  Has hot takes on Ben Simmons, NBA All-Star.  Only on the Internet.  And look at you; desperate.    Edit:   * I bet 10 bucks cashapp my rifle is more expensive than your car."
Wiggins' age is still startling to me. He won ROY in 2015.   Malcom Brogdon won ROY in 2017. He is 2 years OLDER than Wiggins.  Ben Simmons won ROY in 2018. He is only \~1 year younger than Wiggins.
&gt; He is still contending for RotY  Idk man Ben Simmons is making a really strong case for it
Ben Simmons isn't and never has been top 10 in a defensive metric that uses +- data
Ben Simmons isn't on here so it's a garbage advanced stat
"Yup, saying that Matisse Thybulle is a shit shooter who won't be able to play crunch time playoff minutes in a lineup with a total non-shooter in Ben Simmons sure is a ""dumbass thing""  Just admit that you're a salty homer who doesn't really know much and move on"
"Can you guys not tell I am clearly joking here....... relax lmfao  You're probably one of those anti pot, war on drugs guys arent you... Also, Ben Simmons is overrated, all jokes aside he certainly is overrated. Hes great, but he is overrated."
Ppl probably don't know the hate surrounding the roze skin and assumed it's just random ben simmons hate
"they took oladipo and late picks over ben simmons , fewer late picks and thybulle/maxey/milton lol  fuck tilman yo"
"Lol my b, thought the sarcasm was clear! Ben simmons is the shit, the sixers are one of the 4 teams i follow/love ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"I never said Simmons could fucking shoot nor was I the one to say that he is very good at all offensive aspects of the game. Simmons is an elite playmaker and, like I said before which you so obviously ignored, he facilitates the most 3pts out of ANYBODY in the NBA. I get that he doesn‚Äôt shoot them himself and frankly I don‚Äôt give a flying fuck because without him do you know how shit our team looks offensively? It‚Äôs Tobias floundering around while Embiid ends up with nobody to pass it to. Ben is the glue of this team offensively and if you don‚Äôt know that you simply don‚Äôt know basketball or don‚Äôt watch the Sixers, or both.  I know assisting isn‚Äôt the same thing as making them yourself but in what world does being the #1 3pt assister become irrelevant like you try to make it out to be?  Simmons lacks only in 3pt shooting. Literally everything else he is elite. You just think 3pt shooting is the only thing that exists because you‚Äôre a GSW fan."
"lets just say if he could shoot 3s on the same level as sniping, there would be little to no hate on ben simmons as a nba player"
What does his height have to do with his opinion? All hail Ben Simmons who was born taller than most.
Not Ben Simmons haha
"Derozan isn‚Äôt gonna have a wide open mid range because you have to remember that the total area on the floor shrinks massively. If we‚Äôre playing with shooters like Steph and Dame, you have to play them at the half court line which is 47 feet and 50 feet wide. That comes to a total area that defenses have to cover of 2350 square feet. Now if we‚Äôre playing with this lineup, realistically every 3 pointer is inefficient for them so you let them jack up as many as they want and you play from inside the 3 point line. If you do this, the area you‚Äôll have to cover reduces to 886 square feet. That‚Äôs less than half the distance you have to cover. Now regarding Derozan, he will never have a wide open jumper because the spacing on the floor is so lacklustre that the help will always be able to get there. So not only are they shooting an inefficient mid range jumper, but a highly contested one as well. Even in the older era they required spacing. Michael Jordan on his post up had Steve Kerr spacing the floor. Ben Simmons won‚Äôt be able to cut because there are no breakdowns to cut through. In any sport you play, space is necessary and is fundamental for success and this team would have none"
it didn't format the way I typed it up lol. He's on that ben simmons rookie plan.
"You may not agree with me, but is it possible that Simmons is the better defender and Gobert is more impactful? Not even saying Ben should win DPOY for that because I see the value in being most impactful. I just think that centers are more important for defenses so they're naturally going to be most impactful."

If Ben Simmons was 6‚Äô3 he‚Äôd be working at Wendy‚Äôs
Of course a center would look better on defense. There are no centers in the nba to guard. Gobert is looks great until Joel or Joker come to town and tear him up. Because they are good players at the center position unlike basically the rest of the nba.    Ben Simmons is constantly guarding thr best players in the world. Every game. At 4 different positions.   I dont advanced stats people. I think its cool or whatever. But sometimes you gotta watch the games too.   Lebron scoring 32 on Ben can be a much better defensive performance than Gobert holding steven Adams to 13.
Fuck Ben Simmons. That aint my DPOY. ROZE skin wearing motherfucker.
Steph/Ben/Joel is such a perfect big 3 its insane. All of them pretty much cover the others weakness. Simmons DHOs to Steph is stupidly unfair.
It really depends how you define a 5. There's probably less than 10 centers who would have a good matchup vs Simmons at the 5  The true centers with some back to basket game it wouldn't be wise to put Simmons on. Basically Vucevic/Jokic/Nurkic/KAT/Adams/Aayton/Capela/Sabonis off the top of my head. I'd probably throw Julius Randle in there too even though he's played the 4 spot most of the year. Also interested to see how Ben does vs Giannis now given he's a bit stronger this year.
Its because of Ben simmons and its a good reason... If ben is aggressive we have a shot like he has been his last like 17 games where he is avg 23/7/7... if he isnt then we are fucked because everything slows down in the playoffs and you arent playing shit teams every other day. Boston/Miami play zone and that fucks the sixers because of ben simmons. As great as joel is and he is batman our playoff success will always come down to ben simmons... He needs to be aggressive and look to score to open things up for everyone or we will see the same dumbass zone where joel is triple teamed with nobody guarding ben which makes adjusting and getting back on defense really easy.
"This conversation is wild. The Raptors aren't going anywhere this year or in the foreseeable future. Thats facts. When healthy with a tight rotation they could probably steal a 4/5 series but that's about it.   The Sixers are not going to have success in the playoffs with Ben Simmons as their primary ball handler/second option. This is also facts. We've seen this with Giannis as well and Ben Simmons is very much a poor mans Giannis.  I think this Philly team as constructed will be a tough out in the 2nd round. Miami, Milwaukee, or Boston can definitely beat them. Indiana, or a even a healthy Toronto might be able to upset them as well but I think that's unlikely.   If you think Ben Simmons is better than Kyle Lowry, particularly in the playoffs, I don't really know what to say to you. Philly should be all in on Lowry, especially if they can somehow keep Thybulle and Danny Green.   Ben Simmons is a quality starter but he's definitely overrated. Overrated doesn't mean bad. Devin Booker is overrated and that dude is a flamethrower. Khris Middleton is overrated and he's a 50/40/90 guy. Overrated does not mean bad."
[Wojnarowski] NBA has fined Ben Simmons and Seth Curry $20000 each for praising the referees  /s
"Oh no doubt, Simmons has a stronger narrative. He has the best hype man in his corner after all. Narratives win awards, but narratives also lead to players winning awards who probably don't deserve it.   I'm not about to get into a late night DPOY debate, but if this really isn't close from a metrics standpoint. All the people who voted Giannis DPOY and MVP for his metrics will have to change their criteria to make Ben the new DPOY. I don't think they will, but if they vote the same way last year it's Gobert and not particularly close."
"First off, I want you guys to have Lowry. I like the Sixers. I think  Embiid is one of the best big men ever to touch a basketball. Danny Green is my boy and I'm a big fan of Tobias Harris. The Sixers logo with the bell is cool AF and I grew up on the VC/Iverson rivalry.  Secondly, Ben Simmons is ass. The mans averages are ass. He's a homeless mans Giannis and is probably the easiest ""star"" to plan for come playoff time. Once they can hide him behind Lowry, the Sixers will have a legit shot at a chip, until then, I don't think Philly gets out of the second round."
sixers have the 2nd best defense in the NBA... Ben Simmons is the DPOY.. If Thyb got more minutes he would be the best defender in the NBA. Ben/Joel/Thyb all are better defenders over Dray
Ben Simmons is a bad basketball player
/r/nba turning up today lets go. Fuck Ben Simmons
And what is Simmons? An NBA player üòÇ without what Ben Simmons and his colleagues this man is a nobody
"Wait so no one ever thought to hide his weakness before. Makes you wonder why weaknesses are such a big deal, turns out you just have to hide them, you're right, Ben Simmons is not elite."
"And if you clog the lane for Giannis, he'll pass to DeMar for a wide open midrange shot. If you rotate fast enough, he passes to a cutting Ben Simmons. Offensive rebounds are easier because they aren't shooting 3s, leading to less long rebounds. With a great rebounding team of Gobert, Simmons, Giannis, there will be more possessions and opportunities and likely more free throw attempts"

"Ben Simmons is like a cheeseburger: perfect as is, but people still want that second patty."
Ben Simmons is overrated ! But you know what‚Äôs not overrated? How much better my balance is when I‚Äôm wearing my powerbalance band.
"come on dude. now you and everyone are just being completely enthralled by who Pop is. it's obviously a politically correct answer during a public media interview. he's not going to straight up say ""yes, he should shoot more. no arguing about that."" he has to caveat it, and he literally says ""who gives a damn if he can't shoot?"" *everybody who cares gives a damn.* all you have to agree to is that you would prefer a ben simmons who was identical to this one except he shoots 40% from the field to demonstrate you ""give a damn."""
"I think there was just a lot of questions on all the top guys. There was no clear cut star at the top like Zion or Ben Simmons. A lot of the questions have come back with positives. Ant is still raw but not too raw to play in the NBA. Lamelo has been a lot more well rounded then anyone expected. Wiseman has been hurt off and on all season so it is hard to really get a judge of him, but when he does play he is a positive for the team. Quickley, Saddiq Bey, Haliburton, Maxey, Patrick Williams etc etc, lots of players are helping their teams win games. This draft at this point feels closer to 2018 then it does to 2000."
Luka isn't Ben Simmons. He's improved a shit ton this season. He's improved from the 3 and created mid range game.
lmao why do sixers fans get so mad about jabs at Ben Simmons?
22 year old harden dominated the Spurs in the 2012 WCF and took over games in the clutch. Ben Simmons hasn‚Äôt even reached that level yet lmao
"Nine have a weakness that glaring and that odd. Dame could be all time if he were a better defender but it's not like he freezes in place every possession and refuses to try. He tries and just isn't that great.  Gobert could be all time if he added more of an offensive game, but there's no one specific thing that would catapult him. What's odd about Ben is not that he is falling short on one aspect of his game, it's that that aspect does not exist. He literally does not shoot the ball. Simmons takes a similar percentage of his shots from past 10ft as Rudy Gobert, who is not famed for his versitile scoring abilities.  Simmons might be the only elite player ever who becomes all time great if they become below average at something. Not even good, just making a half hearted attempt twice a game."
"There‚Äôs no ‚Äúdepends on the offense‚Äù lmao every fucking playoff teams offense gets hindered by a guard that can‚Äôt shoot at all  It doesn‚Äôt matter how pretty Ben looked guarding Kawhi, fact of the matter is he didn‚Äôt slow him down and was useless on offense. Nobody asked him to win the title, just not be useless on offense  I don‚Äôt really care about him beating up on the 2019 nets lol they were a weak team and it wasn‚Äôt impressive, they had nobody to match him physically. Against the raptors he was destroyed   You just seem super upset that Ben Simmons has major flaws in his game and just because coach pop said he‚Äôs a good player in an interview isn‚Äôt going to make Simmons useful in the playoffs"
Ben Simmons as well
Same goes with Ben Simmons. I hate takes like these
"Ben Simmons.  Of non Sixers though, Klay Thompson and Damian Lillard"
"First off, Trae, LaVine, and Brown have never been the 1st option on a winning team.   Second off, we‚Äôre talking about basketball impact not ‚Äúwho is the better 1st option.‚Äù Guys like Draymond, Klay, Ben Wallace, Gobert have all had top 20 impact while not being a ‚Äú1st option‚Äù which is really just another way to say scorer. And obviously there‚Äôs a lot more to basketball than scoring. And you knew that because you have CP3 on there whose averaging less points than Simmons."
Lebron  KD  Harden  Curry  AD  Kawhi  Giannis  Jokic  Embiid  Dame  Luka  Kyrie  PG  Booker  CP3  Tatum  Bam   Gobert  Butler  Zion   Lavine  Trae   Beal  Vucevic   KAT  Brown    That's 26 guys I'd take over Ben Simmons rn
So you think Ben Simmons is better than Stephen Curry?
*angry Ben Simmons noises*
Lebron Steph Giannis Kd Kawhi Kyrie Harden Embiid Tatum Lowry Paul George AD Beal Jimmy buckets  Gobert  Trae young  Luka  Lavine Booker  KAT SGA Dame  Jokic  Zion  Fox Porzingis  I‚Äôd take all these guys over Ben Simmons in the playoffs
I can name 25 players who Ben Simmons **doesn't** have a bigger impact on the game on both sides of the court than.
"Why does it have to be on both sides of the court? Like, Steph Curry impacts the game more on offense than Ben Simmons impacts the game on both ends of the court combined.   I could definitely name 25 players i'd rather have than Ben Simmons if your criteria weren't so specific."
"ESPN:  Sixers win once again proves that Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons can't play together, is it time Joel Embiid demands a trade and forces his way to the juggernaut Knicks to join with Devin Booker for the playoff push?"
"That's what you say so your opponent doesn't improve his game ;-)  I like Ben Simmons. But I'll stand by this comment no matter how much I get down voted: HE IS NOT A BACK COURT PLAYER.   Just because he's a great passer doesn't make him a point guard.   He is a front court player, and if you had a C, or PF who would attack from the elbow and set up plays, very few people would be asking about his jump shot.   And he could STILL use his passing skills.   But playing him at guard... well.... guards need to be able to shoot.   And he may very well be an elite defender, and an elite passer. But at the end of the day, your point guard needs to be able to hit a jump shot or you are letting defenses off the hook, and even if you get by in the regular season with that, it will fucking kill you in a seven game series."
"Yikes, it's definitely not like we had Brett Brown who consistently got out coached in every series and Al Horford who was nearly unplayable, as well as no Ben Simmons"
"That‚Äôs fair. But out of Bron, Giannis, Harden, Kd, Steph, Ad, Embid, Jokic, Luka, Dame, Kyrie, Kawhi, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, who can Middleton go above? Plus there‚Äôs still arguments for Jaylen Brown, Ben Simmons, Beal, Lavigne, and Mitchell over Middleton."
"&gt; Ben is in a situation that hides his weakness  Player plays in system that allows him flourish.  Shocking.  &gt;Whereas last year, even their own coach was begging him indirectly in public to get him to shoot due to the roster construction.  Yea and where is that coach right now?  &gt;Let's see what happens in the playoffs  Nobody is arguing this, just that continuing to disagree with some of the best basketball minds in the world is really fucking dumb.  Giannis has a skillset very similar to Simmons and his teams struggles in the playoffs as well.  I think that he is in the perfect spot right now to maximize his RIGHT NOW potential.  The sixers are completely unreliant on his scoring to win games, and need him for his open court playmaking, making sure the team gets into the right play and gets a good look, and his shut down defense.  The warriors won with Dray, and the Cs won with Tony Allen and Rondo.  This would be a much bigger issue if we needed his offensive production but really we don't; on most nights hes the 4th or 5th option."
[6ers aren't better with Simmons according to his on-off.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/simmobe01/on-off/2021) Using opponent ortg just doesn't work man... Obviously Ben and Dray are elite defenders.
So you think Ben Simmons is scarier than Kevin Durant?
Give me a cocky Ben Simmons all damn day. Inject it into my jugular
"&gt;Lol what do you want them to say? Ben Simmons sucks and he can‚Äôt shoot, can‚Äôt wait for my team to play him? Everyone knows he‚Äôs a good player, but a main ball handler why doesn‚Äôt score outside 3 feet isn‚Äôt winning shit in this league and until ben simmons proves otherwise this doesn‚Äôt matter.  This is exactly the shit I am talking about.  Both Doc Rivers and Pop are out here saying that he's an elite player and you're like ""nah.""  So what do you know that two of the greatest basketball minds of their generation don't?  &gt;Even in the sixers best playoff run, all he did was average 11 and 5 on middling efficiency and make it harder for his team on offense in the series that mattered  As soon as people start arguing stats like this I immediately tune out and shows how little people understand the sport in general.  Simmons impact is not remotely captured statistically and any attempt to invalidate said impact with statistics is laughable as fuck.  Furthermore his playoff per game totals are one click away and you still got them wrong.  Such a laughable take."
"Draymond is amazing. It‚Äôs crazy how many 2 on 1s he breaks up by himself. One of the best defenders of all time.  But honestly Ben Simmons deserves it more he‚Äôs been unbelievable too. His defense on harden, dame, Lavine, Lebron etc has been a spectacle to watch.  Warriors and Sixers are my teams so I do watch all the games that don‚Äôt overlap"
We're talking about an 8 seed here. Ben Simmons completely dominated the Heat and Nets in the first round
I‚Äôll rather play Ben Simmons in the playoffs than the Nets
can you even tell me who kawhi guarded that series? harden doesnt have the necessary defense to pull off guarding ben simmons whos playing off ball?
"Lol what do you want them to say? Ben Simmons sucks and he can‚Äôt shoot, can‚Äôt wait for my team to play him? Everyone knows he‚Äôs a good player, but a main ball handler why doesn‚Äôt score outside 3 feet isn‚Äôt winning shit in this league and until ben simmons proves otherwise this doesn‚Äôt matter.  Even in the sixers best playoff run, all he did was average 11 and 5 on middling efficiency and make it harder for his team on offense in the series that mattered"
Remeber when Ben Simmons scored 1 point in the playoffs against the celtics.
"Excuse me sir, that's Ben Simmons"
Just this year. (Not counting tonight yet)  Both Ben and Joel: DefRtg: 106.30  Neither: 107.51  Just Embiid: 112.33  Just Simmons: 117.06
The cycle continues:  * someone says some dumb shit about Ben Simmons being overrated * Ben Simmons proceeds to have a good game and then claps back in the post-game interview * people now get even more angry at Ben Simmons and more people call him overrated  Maybe Ben Simmons is just really really good and you should just shut the fuck up?
Ben Simmons is heightest
L after L sounds like the Sixers in the second round as long as Ben ‚Äúcan‚Äôt  score outside of 6 feet or even run a pick and roll‚Äù Simmons is their best ball hander.
"Ben ‚Äúone of, if not *the* most overrated player(s)‚Äù Simmons. What a beast"
"Nah, they‚Äôre frauds. They‚Äôll never truly contend as long as Ben Simmons is their best ball hander. Good luck running a successful offence in critical playoff situations with both him and his defender standing around the basket fucking spacing up completely."
Been true for 4 years the ultimate bell weather for when Philly is on a roll are Ben Simmons weak side cuts for wide open dunks
Jazz fans have no gripe they shot 40 threes.  We have Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris driving and getting hacked.  No calls and still up 8.
Ben Simmons with Trae Young‚Äôs shooting and Dames clutch game.
Between him &amp; Gobert. The weird obsession of forcing Ben Simmons into the convo despite not even being the best defender on his own damn team continues to amaze me though.
Ben Simmons looks like he hasn't played basketball in three weeks. It's only been a week and a half or something like that but man is he rusty.
*Breaking News: Pop say Ben Simmons can't shoot!*
Ben Simmons a decent candidate
"holy fucking shit the guy who's basketball opinion and insight i value the most just said what i've been saying for the past two years.  i've been that guy saying ""Ben Simmons doesn't need a jumpshot"" in every thread i've seen.  i feel validated af rn"
"Yes, but that‚Äôs almost always in the case of perimeter defenders like Curry/Westbrook/Iverson who sell out for steals. If you watch Jokic, the vast majority of his steals and deflections come from him using his ridiculous length and hands to disrupt passing lanes and pick pockets without sacrificing his position. It‚Äôs not really the same thing.   I agree with what you‚Äôre saying, but what I‚Äôm arguing is that in Jokic‚Äôs case, the steals and deflections actually are a real value added part of his game, not a symptom of him being a bad defender. Think about it- most of his offensive value comes from his coordination, length, and BBIQ/positioning, so it makes sense those skills would also show up on the defensive end. Steals are also more valuable than blocks because they result in a change of possession, something that‚Äôs especially valuable with Jokic because he often converts them into instant points with a full court pass. Jokic is definitely harmed from preconceptions about his position just like Ben Simmons is harmed by preconceptions of his (eg PGs NEED to shoot 3s)."
"That‚Äôs like people saying Ben Simmons is an ass PG because he doesn‚Äôt shoot 3s, when modern PGs are expected to. Some players can derive impact in unconventional ways at their position and need to be assessed holistically."
"What could he have done? That raptors team was better than any team the nuggets have beaten. Embiid put up the best plus minus in the series by double. Besides that, he had only ben Simmons 3 years ago and made it to the 2nd round. Last year it was only him and Tobias. Simmons was out, our second best wing defender also out."
ben simmons
Ben simmons isnt elevating a team tho. Hes a secondary player under a star player imo. Sixers are nothing without embiid
"This is by far the shittiest take Simmons has ever had. Ben Simmons is not remotely a top 25 player in the NBA. He's also not remotely good enough to be a #1 or #2 on a perennial contender.   Before you sixers nephews downvote the fuck out of me, Miami last year was not a great finals team. Nice run, but nowhere near the caliber of finals teams of the last 5 years or so. If you think Ben Simmons is better than Bam or Jimmy you need to stay off the weed."
They would still take the draft picks over Ben Simmons with no regrets. They want zero expectations and cut costs
Impressive considering the guy was a Ben Simmons lvl shooter coming out of college
"oh no, ben simmons made 1 three in that one game he's very consistent from range"
"Eh, I think he‚Äôs alright. On his podcast, he gets totally hung up on a detail a guest mentions during a larger argument and will argue a point no one was talking about and finalize it and then move on.  Like, someone might be talking about the sixers transition game and he‚Äôll start going on about how good of a defender Ben Simmons is, which isn‚Äôt in dispute in this context. This is also a made up example, not a literal citation btw.  I don‚Äôt think he knows as much as others do and I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs all that good at analysis of the game to hang with a lot of the others so he belabors points that he understands and refocuses the conversation to feel more in control.  I also feel like he has a weird, blunt way of changing subjects that feels off putting. Lowe, Woj and others are able to shift gears much easier and more naturally.  But, this is just about his podcasting. I don‚Äôt hate Windhorst but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs great, he‚Äôs okay. And I don‚Äôt begrudge him getting the gig he‚Äôs gotten, he‚Äôs worked hard at it and I would if I was him."
"If Simmons is on HOU and demands a trade in two years and only wants to play for (and sign an extension with) a good team, what would we be getting back?  More short-term FRPs that probably won't be any good?  Or more long-term FRPs that go into the 2030 season and extend the rebuild?  HOU is shorting Brooklyn's long-term future (i.e., up to 2028).  Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't.  But it's more likely to work than shorting Philly's short-term future and then another contender's short term future a couple years down the road imo.  And it's faster than holding Ben for a couple years and trading him for picks that go into 2030."
Lmao they can easily flip Ben Simmons for more assets. Minnesota fan mentioned flipping Ben for Anthony Edwards + filler + picks.
But would you rather have a 4 mid lottery picks or Ben Simmons?
This is a shit take. Ben Simmons is hard to build around and not someone you want as your best player. Also would not line up with a rebuilding timeline. We lose our pick if we aren‚Äôt in the top 4 this year. The only bad thing in the Harden trade was flipping LeVert for Oladipo but even then LeVert‚Äôs cancer was caught because of that so it‚Äôs even hard to feel bad there.
Kuzma Ben Simmons Blake Griffin Jordan Clarkson
"Was Ben on the table for sure? Or are these rumors? Because if they had a chance to land Simmons, and they ended up with *this*, then woooooowwww"
"Bill is right. Ben Simmons, Eric Gordon &amp; Christian wood is definitely a playoff team."
"I went to an ACC school for college, so I knew Ingram was legit because I saw him play. I was wrong about jabari, though. He was sooo good in college. *Technically*, I thought Dwight was gonna bring us a ring and it kinda happened lol An easy one was Ben Simmons being an amazing slasher. If I‚Äôm gonna be honest, I am wrong wayyy more than I am right. It‚Äôs absolutely impossible to consistently pick who is gonna be the next big thing. Of the current top 10 players in the NBA I was right about 2 of them. And that‚Äôs because AD and Lebron were easy calls. I thought KD was too small, steph was injury-prone, didn‚Äôt know harden well, didn‚Äôt know giannis well, I *did* actually like Leonard‚Äôs game in college, but who tf could‚Äôve called him being that good? I didn‚Äôt really know embiid. When all these guys were coming up, I just thought there was no way anyone would replace Tim Duncan, kobe, kg, and Lebron. Makes you think the next big thing is really close, ya know? Or they might be here already"
I know you're joking but it's safe to say those picks are not going to give a Ben Simmons type players.
"I knew he was delusional enough to think he was Jokic/Embiid on offense. Evidently he thinks he's Ben Simmons on defense, too."
"There are a very small handful of players drafted every year that are better, and they're not even remotely always drafted wherever the Rockets would be picking, *and* it's a gamble that whoever the Rockets pick would even remain in the league after a few years. Facts, too. Rockets would be *thrilled* if those picks turned into a guy as good as Ben Simmons or as good as it looks like JA is going to end up."
"Even if they are lotto picks, how likely is one of those to turn into a Ben Simmons quality player?"
So cut John Wall lol. Having Ben Simmons and no one else likely puts you in a better position than the Rockets are in now.
"I like your answers.  For 4b, hack-a-Shaq is only for the last 2 minutes for each quarter, correct? That shouldn't stop someone from fouling guys like Gobert, Howard, Jordan, even Ben Simmons, etc. before the last 2 minutes, especially in the 4th quarter."
"Ben Simmons is only 11, so it still too early to say.  His dad has below average height and BBIQ, so the odds are against him to be that type of player.  The good thing is his family is rich and the owner of a major podcast network, that would help him with training and connection."
&gt;They could‚Äôve had Ben Simmons ... a top 25 guy who can be the first or second best player on a perennial contender  I guess I'm a hater because while he is a great defender he's like the 4th scoring option on his own team
"Probably. Build a team with lots of good shooting and a decent center and I don‚Äôt see why they couldn‚Äôt be serious contenders with his playmaking. He can‚Äôt be the best scorer on your team, but he could be the best player.   For example:  Ben Simmons, Bradley Beal, Mikal Bridges, Tobias Harris, Rudy Gobert.  Simmons is probably the best player on a team like this because Beal sucks so bad at defense, but a team like that could win the championship.  Some of this depends on era too. Are they winning a championship against healthy Brooklyn? No. Could a team like this win absent of a super team (like if the super team gets injured like in 2019, or 2020) sure."
"If Ben Simmons is the best player on your team, you're not contending for anything"
"Fertitta let his ego/pride get the best of him and he refused to deal with Morey. He's dumb. Could've had your ""big three"" for the next couple years consisting of Ben Simmons, John Wall, and Christian Wood. Could've also had Matisse Thybulle as well along with a couple of first round picks.  That man really could've had the perfect setup for a post Harden rebuild. He would have Simmons be his big ticket guy who got people to go to a Rockets game and to build the team around. Silas wouldn't have to suffer through a dreadful first season as a HC with nothing to work with and constant losses. The team would've had first round picks which the Rockets desperately needed. On top of all that I feel a roster with John Wall, Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Eric Gordon, Christian Wood, Kevin Porter Jr, Kelly Olynyk, and DJ Augustin on it would've definitely been able to get the Rockets into a play-in game and possibly sneak into the playoffs. At the very least, it'd be a decent team going forward and you have SOMETHING to get Rockets fans on board with and excited about. Shit, chances are if the roster looked like that Demarcus Cousins and PJ Tucker possibly would've stayed for the rest of the season and helped the team out even more.  Bottomline man, don't let emotions and pettiness keep you from seeing the bigger picture. Fertitta could've had the Rockets hit the ground running once Harden was traded. Instead he let the team trip and fall flat on its face then skid along the ground into a 20 game losing streak and likely last place finish at the end of this season with not all that much to look forward to next season.  I just hate seeing any team completely fall apart due to a shitty owner. I've seen it too many times and wouldn't wish it on any team. Besides the Nets."
Let‚Äôs me be honest if Ben Simmons your best player literally no one else must can score 20 a night and y‚Äôall still be trash
Then trade Ben Simmons for 5 non-Brooklyn 1sts!
"Think about it this way.  Ben Simmons was a consensus #1 pick.  The likelihood that any of those picks ends up being #1, let alone #1 in a year where there's a clear frontrunner, is pretty low.  Yeah, you could get lucky like the Celtics did and pull off multiple top 3 picks, but that trade looks way better in hindsight and could have easily been 3 top 10-15 picks.   I'm not saying it was a bad decision necessarily, but it is true that the likelihood of any of those picks being better than Ben Simmons as a prospect is low. That doesn't even count savvy/lucky drafting on the Celtics part.  Tatum could have easily been Fultz or Lonzo (or Josh Jackson), and the next two picks after Jaylen Brown was Dragan Bender and Kris Dunn.  Just saying, 4 picks and 4 swaps isn't a guarantee of anything."
You don't know what the future firsts become yet though. Right now it's easy to knock on it because 'Ben Simmons' is tangible but those picks could be amazing.
"&gt; I think he can be a solid 3rd option on a title contending team. He could be the 2nd option if the team has another good efficient scorer.  Best player and first scoring option aren't necessarily the same thing, but regardless, no I don't think Ben Simmons could be the best player on a championship team.  There are only like 8 guys at most who fit that description right now."
bill simmons LOVES ben simmons lol
"I mean yeah, with all due respect to Ben Simmons he isn‚Äôt that amazing of an asset for a rebuilding team, he absolutely isn‚Äôt worth the sacrifices of Brooklyn picks and swaps that have the potential to be incredibly valuable in 2024 onwards"
"What does having Ben Simmons get the HOU Rockets? What team can they build around Simmons/Wall/Gordon's contracts?   Go build anything other than a 6-8 seed at best around those assets in fantasy GM land and even in perfect scenarios and see what the future outlook for that team is.   Then ask yourself in 2 years will Ben be able to net you potentially 3-4 firsts of the same value as the late BKN picks and HOUs potential 1st this year?   Ben puts HOU in the middle of the pack for mediocrity and they become the ORL Magic of the West (prior to ORL blowing it up at the deadline).   It's easier to just accept the full rebuild early. Also if HOU waits 2 years to go into a rebuild look at their pick situations even outside of this year. They don't tank w/ Ben for 2 and they have their own picks those 2 years, then they go full rebuild and owe next 3 firsts to OKC w/ only top 4 protections. Which timeframe is better to bottom out with?   If your argument is to not bottom out at all, then as I said go find fantasy land scenarios where you put Ben on a contender in HOU w/ Wall &amp; Gordon contracts on the books w/ the depleted assets HOU had post Westbrook-CP3 trade."
They could even be Ben Simmons!!!
He's the only one who's actually thought critically about the Rockets future. Everyone else is circlejerking about how the Rockets fans must hate not having Ben Simmons next to John Wall lol
So you‚Äôd rather have a shot at maybe drafting a Ben Simmons rather than actually having Ben Simmons? That‚Äôs your logic?  Sorry but proven talent over potential always. Draft picks are actually pretty useless most of the time. Casuals and online forums tend to heavily overrate them. Most picks end up out of the league or fringe rotation players. How many first round picks with constant tanking did it take for the sixers to even hit on Simmons? It took years and luck. So when you have the chance to actually acquire a star you don‚Äôt pass it up for more unknowns
Those hypothetical Ben Simmons packages still had more chances of happening than the hypothetical Oladipo packages because Ben Simmons is the better player.
Here are a couple reasons:  1. Lebron James and Anthony Davis 2. Kawhi Leonard and Paul George 3. Kevin Durant and James Harden 4. Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid
"As a big Ben Simmons fan, I'm very happy for him that he doesn't have to play for that loose butthole, Tillman Fertita"
"You don‚Äôt need him to be your number one. He‚Äôs an all nba player on a max, you have control of him for. 4 years. You can flip him for a better young core or you can trade him for more draft assets. Also Ben Simmons is an all nba and all defensive guy. He‚Äôs a dream to get in a draft   It‚Äôs literally impossible to lose with Ben Simmons as an asset"
"Dude y'all got hoed. Draft picks are super overrated. I mean come on, so many players end being busts/mediocre players. It's very rare to find anyone close to Ben Simmons or harden. Look at fucking NYK and Minny. Those teams have been shit for years and have had a lot top picks and so many flamed out. NYK is only finally getting good and minny is still shit. You always want to get established players in the league NOW. Also Ben simmons and Christian wood would be a fun combo to watch imo."
"Levert is 2 years older than Ben Simmons, just 2 years younger than Oladipo"
"by virtue of contract status any baller on a rookie deal will be extra high up on the list.  Basically dudes like Luka, Zion, LaMelo &amp; Ja Morant will be way up there and then you'll have the veteran studs that are under contract for several years (Jokic, Ben Simmons, Embiid, Giannis, Harden, AD, Dame, Beal, LeBron).  Kawhi &amp; Curry obviously have insanely high trade value, but the fact that they can opt out after this season would probably ding them a bit."
"Idk that Ben Simmons was ever fully on the table in a reasonable capacity, if he was then 100% should have got him. but they for sure should have at least taken LeVert and Allen over Oladipo and the Bucks 2021 first."
"And you had leverage with harden he was under contract for multiple years. He‚Äôs not an expiring so no team has to worry about him bolting in the off season.   You dream of getting a Ben Simmons level player in the draft. It‚Äôs why he‚Äôs worth more than half a dozen first round picks. Most picks are bust or never hit an all nba level. To get one in a trade who is locked into contract for years is the perfect scenario for a rebuilding team   Your team fucked up, stop trying to cope"
I can't wait to see how close Danny Ainge would have gotten to a potential Ben Simmons trade
I *really* thought we were gonna turn the first pick into Ben Simmons. Still sad that that didn't happen.
"I'll just say I dont think the Sixers would trade Ben Simmons alone for the whole Harden package, AND we were offering some more picks and one of Maxey/Thybulle lol"
"I just don't think we are watching the same guy.    I'll start offensively: This year he added the ability to drive and take people off the dribble. Literally every pacer fan I know that watches the games has commented on it. Enjoy [Several attacks in a row](https://twitter.com/Gilbertology_/status/1356395576930263041?s=20) or take a look at [Exhibit A.](https://twitter.com/TEastNBA/status/1371665221417336832?s=20) and  [Exhibit B](https://twitter.com/GrantAfseth/status/1349422438451470336?s=20).  We have [whole articles being written](https://twitter.com/MSchindlerNBA/status/1361370152361746433?s=20) about his improved aggressiveness.    He has also deployed nifty bounce passes to cutters two things he never did offensively.  His passing in general has improved.  He never did any of this until this year:  [no look](https://twitter.com/MylesTurner_BR/status/1360792416039686146?s=20) and [outlet pass](https://twitter.com/FSIndiana/status/1371669071498862596?s=20)  He rotates extremely well and is the main reason the pacers have any defense because the pacers perimeter defenders get beat constantly.  Of course he is going to rotate and then potentially get beat by a pass when he has to do it nearly _every_ possession the opposing team drives.  That's why the weak side defender is supposed to step in and cover that passing angle or guard Myles' man.  Even given that, Myles often times recovers and gets the block or stops the shot.  [The guy is leading the league with opponent FG% at the rim!!!!!!!](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-lt6/)  - [Help defense 1](https://twitter.com/MSchindlerNBA/status/1370755935786967041?s=20) - [help defense 2](https://twitter.com/HoopInformatics/status/1353414546975821824?s=20) - [help defense 3](https://twitter.com/stevejones20/status/1349929917635584004?s=20)  &gt;was in the DPOY race earlier this year (lol)  He's still in the race and if he had a competent wing defender and good scheme he would run away with it.  Don't believe me? He's definitely in the race according to NBA.com: [They have him 3rd overall](https://www.nba.com/news/defensive-player-ladder-ben-simmons-steals-no-1-spot).   In the [immortal words of Roy Hibbert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSX-7eHf3tI) ""Yall mf*ckers don't watch us play"""
So when are people gonna learn that single game +/- means absolutely nothing especially in a game with 7 players?  Ben Simmons seems routinely at - 4 every game but he is obviously better than that when you watch the games.
"out of the three guys you listed, I don‚Äôt think matisse guards any of them (probably ben or Tobi on Middleton, Ben on Tatum, Tobi on Kd). He‚Äôs in that top group with Jrue Simmons Dort Smart though"
"Rockets fan here. No Bill, I'm not outraged. I don't think Ben Simmons will ever be the first option on a championship team. His game will age extremely poorly since he can't shoot. Not to mention, he'd probably try to force his way out of Houston b/c we're tanking and he's been there done that. There's a reason Morey made him available this past off-season, no thanks. Rather take my chances in the draft with someone who can shoot the three."
Rockets would‚Äôve been fine if they just traded for Ben Simmons lol. They literally destroyed their own franchise.
The thing is if you guys got ben simmons in that trade the wolves would have easily give up edwards and picks for him. Probably more which is already a better return than you could possibly get. (Idk what y'all exactly got but lmk if I'm wrong here.)
"Ever owner prioritizes profit, however, theres a few ways to skin a cat. Depending on your market, you can be ass and still profit like my knicks or the lakers. If you're in Indiana or Utah, then you need to put out at least a .500 team. Some owners realize that putting together a championship roster is expensive, but can pay off triplicate in the long term.    Personally, and its not like I know the guy, it seems to me that Houston is a big enough market to not reaaaallly need a .500 team. Also, he doesn't strike me as the type to risk profit by assembling an expensive roster. I think he prioritizes himself and short term profits in a way that is not conducive to team success.    If the rumors are true that he didn't trade for Ben simmons because he dislikes morey then he instantly becomes the worst owner in the league imo"
Ben Simmons is 24 and has 4 years left on his contract. There is maybe a 10% chance that any of your picks are gonna have more value than that.
You are delusional if you think that Ben Simmons is better than tatum or Donovan. He isn‚Äôt even in the same convo as those 2.   Ben Simmons is a complete liability come playoff time vs a legit defense while running a half court O. He showed this his rookie season vs the Cs and he showed this vs the raptors too. Having a ball handler who will not shoot the ball makes it super easy to defend. The sixers basically had to make jimmy run point that postseason because Ben was so bad.   Pretty much every draft there are 1 or 2 guys that are better than Ben. The rockets didn‚Äôt mess up that badly by tanking for Cade/emoni
"It must be tough rooting for a team that had 3 MVPs and accomplished literally nothing. If ripping on Ben Simmons helps you manage, go for it bud"
fans of the rockets  they could have had ben simmons   instead shit sandwich
Exactly who is giving a better offer for ben Simmons than what Houston got from bkn?? Who in the world is gonna give up more than 7 combined firsts/swaps for Simmons?? People who say Houston could‚Äôve flipped Simmons for more have no idea what they are saying. It was a historic haul of picks given to Houston. I don‚Äôt even think a team can give more than what bkn did in terms of picks/swaps.   As for what philly offered in terms of draft compensation.. I can‚Äôt imagine it was much besides 2 future firsts for the next 2 years. There‚Äôs no way morey would give up future firsts 4-6 years down the line when he was giving up Simmons already.
"You can say that for any pick, Jokic was taken in the late second round. The truth of the matter is that the odds of them selecting even an all star with those picks are insanely low. It‚Äôs why team usually try to get a young guy who can be 50 cents on the dollar of your star player (SGA, BI, Oladipo/Sabonis). Ben Simmons was that guy, getting a top 25-20 young nba player for your top 5 guy would‚Äôve been smart"
"Not in a specific order but below are the players i would take above zion.  lbj, ad, giannis, luka, kawhi, kd, dame, steph, harden, jokic, embiid, tatum, butler, jaylen brown, ben simmons, kat, chris paul  Thats 17   i think bam, simmons, booker, and paul george. are all around where zion is.   so calling him top 20 is reasonable."
"Because the lottery odds are so inconsistent and the nets would have little incentive to lose. Even then they would have to hit on that draft pick, Ben Simmons was the best talent piece they would get in any trade or pick"
All it takes is getting a guy like Tatum and boom they were right to make the deal. Ben Simmons is good he ain‚Äôt great. And yeah I‚Äôm sure you will mock that like I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs easy to get a guy like Tatum. But it happened for Boston. And they didn‚Äôt even need the first pick for it to happen.
"They can't. We won't know until 2030 perhaps. Right now, it seems that Ben simmons deal is better, but we can't definitely say. If Nets don't win a ring and the rockets find a star, then it may look like a sabonis oladipo paul george trade."
So many people speaking for Rockets fans here. Not everyone likes Ben Simmons. LeVert and Allen aren‚Äôt turning your franchise around. Oladipo was a gamble and unfortunately it didn‚Äôt work out. Harden tanked his value with his shenanigans. We have a ton of picks coming in the next decade and Houston has always been attractive for free agents. Rockets will be fine as long as they draft well.
"They don't need to have added more picks, Ben Simmons + me would be better than what the Rockets ended up with"
"Even then, it's very likely that none of those picks ever develop into more than Ben Simmons is worth. And the OKC pick swaps mean there's still a good chance they don't even get some of those high picks."
"While true, they might have come out at the end with the same amount of picks, it makes sense to believe the quality of picks will be much better trading Ben.  Simmons is only 24 and has 4 years on his contract, that amount of control on a player of his caliber and his age would entice even the bad teams to trade for him (better picks).   There's a reason why only a few teams were actively try to trade for Harden.  With his age and only two years left on his contract, it didn't make sense for tanking teams to give up significant picks and assets for him."
"Except you have to wait 7 years to find out. In this conversation people forget 1 simple thing. Ben Simmons would look even better on a bad team that he does now. You could potentially get a ton of capital for him if you want, if you just let him play out the season. And then he's only 24...keep him, build with young talent, should be any gm's dream to have a superstar. You need just 1 more to compete."
"kinda unfair to get ben simmons as a tank commander, but yeah, awful trade"
Ben Simmons is so overrated
Would be outraged if they had gotten Ben Simmons
"Yeah true. But the Nets series Ben was definitely our best player, had the same series high points as Embiid at 31, and Embiid missed a game. Bens defense on DLo completely stopped any chance the nets mightve had, but even without the D Simmons still has the edge because of the missed game"
"I‚Äôm happy with how it went, Lavert had 2y/32m left, Ben Simmons is on a MAX, no thanks   Even though we know that Tilman was a big factor in not accepting the Simmons package, it had fewer picks/swaps, which are more important than getting a player back in my eyes  I really don‚Äôt understand how people value getting Ben Simmons over a significantly more draft capital, it seems shortsighted to me  Nobody gives the thunder shit for securing picks above all else, they have SGA to build around, rockets are comfortable with KPJ/Wood, end of story lol"
"I guess my question is what‚Äôs the alternative?  Ben Simmons likely isn‚Äôt getting you to the playoffs in the west with this squad. Even if they snuck in, they‚Äôre certainly not ‚Äúcontending‚Äù like Bill insinuates, and I‚Äôm not sure how they add much for 3 years with wall‚Äôs contract and Ben on the books (and missing 3 picks).   Levert DEFINITELY doesn‚Äôt get you to playoffs, the team stays unwatchable, and best case scenario he wins you enough games to lose a few lottery balls.  At least the current route has light at the end of the (very long and very shitty) tunnel. The other options just feel like HOU refusing to take their medicine."
Ben wasn‚Äôt better than Embiid in the Nets series.   Embiid was game breaking in the Nets series. And what you are describing is that Butler who was the better player against the Raptors was a bad fit beside Simmons.   So all I‚Äôm saying is Simmons is difficult to build around because you can‚Äôt always get the best player available and you need to focus on fit more. That happened with Butler in that series.
"Why take a chance on future picks when you can have players like Ben Simmons and Thybulle, or Caris and Jarrett? I guess if you're lucky, those future picks can turn into players as good as Ben Simmons and Thybulle or Caris and Jarrett!"
"When you're taking about someone with Ben Simmons' talent, you take Ben Simmons over a *chance* at high-enough pick that'll let you take a player which in turn has a *chance* to be good. It's multiple layers of RNG.  Even if you don't want Ben Simmons, you can easily flip him for better stuff than what turned out to be what the Rockets got in the end."
"Not really. BI, Brown are at the same level as Simmons.   2017 you could have gotten tatum who is significantly better than Simmons, and if you fell in love with another prospect that was a slight reach you could have gotten fox who is a decent chunk better.  Zion, luka, ja are all much more valuable going forward.  And if they decided to trade down, Bam and Mitchell are also better.   Ben Simmons is overrated by fans by a bit, but it‚Äôs also that rookie deals are super underrated. Paying Zion 10 million a year is absolutely insane."
"Decent pick return, those picks could possibly even turn into someone as good as Ben Simmons, Jarrett Allen, or Caris LeVert!"
"Even if they didn't want Ben Simmons, they could've had Caris (kidney stuff notwithstanding) and Jarrett, which would make a starting frontcourt of Jarrett and Wood, with Caris running around."
"Butler got the pg duties because he tried to guard Kawhi in game 1 and got absolutely smoked and was atrocious on offense because he was using all his energy doing a shit job on Kawhi, so Ben guarded Kawhi the next 6 games. They won the chip and we took them to 7 and a buzzer beater, and honestly Embiid fucked up by getting in Simmons way on the Kawhi shot. He wasnt great that series but his defense on Kawhi was great, Kawhi just kept making tough mid range jump shots, what else can you do? His offense was bad but his fit with Butler wasnt very good, I remember multiple times Ben would hit Jimmy in the corner and he wouldnt shoot, idk if he was tryna make a point or he saw a driving lane or whatever, but he did that multiple times. Maybe its just the fact that hes not a good 3 point shooter, but he wasnt a great fit plus he took Bens playmaking role (rightfully so) so of course Bens averages will be down. His other series he wasnt good was his rookie year vs Boston, but Ben was our best player in both the playoff series we won, obviously 1st round so nothing major but it counts for something. When Ben was injured last playoffs we got swept 1st round."
"What a truly awful take.  They don't want a star on their team atm because their window is closed.  This team was built on metrics over the last few years.  Which means, when it came time to rebuild, they were always going to tank, since a few good high draft picks are the most reliable way to start a new window.  Better to have a few top 5 picks over the next few seasons, all peaking at the same time in a few years, than a few top 10 picks and an old Ben Simmons eating up too much cap space in a few years.  Plus once you have the talent, FAs and chip hunters will be drawn to you, making roster building even easier.  ....maybe.  Some tanks work, some don't.  But the point is: there's an obvious plan."
"If you watched the sixers, and understood how a player with no shooting ability spaces the floor you would understand, dribble handoffs from Simmons to Klay or Steph would be too easy if Bens defender is in the paint, same as a pick n roll. Ever wonder how Dray gets those rolls where theres 1 guy in the paint and he juat does an easy lob over him? Thats because Drays defender has to step up high on the other side of the screen. It would work the same with Ben but way better, like Dray on steroids"
"Ben Simmons isn‚Äôt turning you into a 10 seed, he‚Äôs just making it a bit entertaining"
"Ben has never played with a shot creating guard next to him, literally never but weve always been a 50 win team with him. He has always played with (except for jimmy butler) at best average playmakers. It really isnt better having a guy like Westbrook just because he fits better and will shoot if hes open. Theres a reason Ben is consistently top in 3 point assists, and its not because hes easy to guard. Youre basically saying hes hard to build around because spacing is expensive, but its not, Simmons went on a 17 win streak without Embiid his rookie year with Saric, RoCo, Bellinelli and Redick. Theyre not even expensive players, theyre all role players. Not saying he would have that kinda win rate consistently against the best teams (that run was mostly against below .500 teams) but thats a cheap team, he could get a lot better players around him."
"Ben Simmons is overrated. He's a great defensive player but this Ben as your 2nd best player is not making the Finals. His weakness will not only get exploited in the playoffs, they'll also make him a liability for his team in the halfcourt.   Ben has regressed again since Embiid got injured and has been poor in their current road trip."
"It's okay, PlentyAppointment is Ben Simmons."
&gt;One of Cade/Green/Mobley is as good of a return as Ben Simmons  No way man. Simmons is already a proven all-nba player. That's way more valuable than a top 3 pick.
"Simmons would be a great fit next to KAT and Dlo. If the Sixers don't make the conference finals, there's a good chance they trade Ben in the off-season.  If they fail again with Jo and Ben duo, I'd take Ant and a top 3 pick  plus sweeteners for Ben in a heartbeat."
"Ben Simmons is cool, but seven bad draft picks could be anything--maybe even Ben Simmons!"
"Eh, people are forgetting that the Rockets pick this year is top 4 protected and bottoming out is much better than being a borderline playoff team.  If they get a top 3 pick this year, they made the right decision. One of Cade/Green/Mobley is as good of a return as Ben Simmons and all those picks and swaps are just the icing on the cake."
"Bill Simmons is only saying that because Ben is his son's favorite player and they both have the same name.  Ben Simmons as your best player is a borderline playoff team. Had they traded for him, they'd probably be picking in the late lottery instead of a top 3 draft pick. Getting one of Cade/Green/Mobley and all those picks and swaps are much better than the Sixers offer.  The ones who should be outraged are Sixers fans. They could've had a free ticket to the Finals but instead they created a superteam in their division. Morey should've given Fertitta and offer he wouldn't be able to refuse. Adding Maxey was all it would take but he decided to haggle and lost his opportunity at a free ticket to the Finals."
"This is the exact same situation that we went through. If you don‚Äôt hit the full reset, you end up being the 10th seed and having the 6th pick and getting Mo Bamba rather than a guy like Doncic.   Ben Simmons probably drags a team to enough wins to fall out of the top 3 picks"
"twisting your words? lmao you‚Äôre the one who has been saying that a player needs to score for them to lead a team into the playoffs...  also, the wizards would be worse because ben and westbrook would absolutely make no sense together  simmons does literally everything, except shooting, at a high or elite level... a team built around simmons can definitely make the playoffs and you‚Äôre on drugs if you think otherwise"
"Dude... it‚Äôs not ‚Äúsmall sample size or not.‚Äù I‚Äôm using Thanasis as an example to show you why nothing is ‚Äúsmall sample size or not.‚Äù Ben Simmons doesn‚Äôt have the right skills set to lead a team to the playoffs. Your best player needs to be able to get buckets when the team needs it, simmons just isn‚Äôt good enough of a scorer"
Read the title too fast and thought that Ben Simmons was talking about Ben Simmons not being traded to the Rockets.
"Hard disagree there.   What a lot of people are missing is the pick protections the Rockets are dealing with.    Draft| 1st Round Picks ---|--- 2021| HOU (If top 4, otherwise they get the worst of MIA/OKC) + MIL + POR 2022 | HOU + BRK 2023 | HOU or BRK (Best) + MIL + WAS (If 15-30, otherwise they get a future 1st) 2024| BRK 2025| OKC or BRK (Best)  2024| BRK 2024| HOU or BRK (Best)  If they tank hard this year they can keep all their own picks for the next 3 drafts before OKC comes collecting on the Westbrook trade in 2024. By that time the Brooklyn picks will just start to get juicy.  LeVert is decent enough to fuck with their tank but historically inefficient and he can't stay healthy. Would you rather LeVert or Cunningham/Mobley?  I can see the argument for taking Ben Simmons, but you don't tie your future to Caris LeVert...   Bill Simmons said the Rockets fucked up... He also said the Celtics fucked up trading an ageing Pierce/KG for Tatum + Brown + Sexton (who was traded for Kyrie)."
They could easily trade Ben Simmons. That would not be a contract that would be hard to move
"? Yes it has. You can hop on bball ref and see it in black and white. Harden, Lebron, Russ, Jokic, Luka, Ben Simmons‚Äî they have have essentially the same career ast/tov ratio."
James Harden - Gojou Satoru (both cute)  Jayson Tatum - Phil from promised neverland  Damian Lillard - Roy Mustang  Blake Griffin - Kagami  Russell Westbrook - Bakugo   LeBron James - Ash Ketchum (really good but always loses when it matters)  Jerome Robinson/Kevin Knox - Brock (brock)  Ben Simmons - Rock Lee (talented)  Luka Doncic - Gaara (young prodigy)  Michael Jordan - Jiren (goated chad with hella game)  Steph Curry - Leorio
"Doing more than 10 because I want to:   Jrue, Dort, Ben Simmons, Giannis, Gobert, Marcus Smart, Bam, OG, Draymond, Embiid, Mikal Bridges, Kawhi, Myles Turner, Dejounte Murray"
I would personally have Ben Simmons over Kawhi. I don't think he's the same defender from San Antonio but still really good
PG Jrue  SG Klay (when healthy)   SF Kawhi  PF Giannis  C Gobert   6th Man Ben Simmons    idk. this is my first time doing these type of lists so if i‚Äôm wrong then let me know
"No problem, I get Ben Simmons is a polarizing topic around here lol"
"Playoff dip with KD thing is overdone but otherwise thought his analysis was fine.   There are valid critques of Durant that dont always get looked at, he's still benefitting from how people evaluate him through the lens of ""LeBron vs Durant"" and people anointing him the 2nd best player in 2012. So Im not shocked some view him as *slightly* overrated.   Ben isnt perfect nobody is, the problem is there is pretty much nobody else like him who is willing to do such thorough exhaustive work when it comes to all time player analysis. It's all just superficial stuff, Bill Simmons 700 page book that did well(and was a worthwhile read) is basically that. So when you have somebody willing to do a real deep dive and really do a film based breakdown youll have some people take it as gospel because there's just no other source of it out there to compare to and look at also. But he's still very good."
When will Ben Simmons come too? Hahaha
"yeah i actually think rudy simmons (or ben gobert) would be a super dangerous player. rudy has no handles and frankly no finishing ability. give him the ability to dribble, and to playmake, and to actually do more than just dunk, and wow that's the mvp right there  &amp;#x200B;  not to mention you're giving rudy fucking gobert the ability to guard iso players the way ben simmons does"
Try watching basketball because yes he is a terrible scorer. This is why watching ball reference isn‚Äôt a good idea because it makes casuals like you think players like Ben Simmons are actually decent scorers
"Ben Simmons has been in the playoffs twice. As a rookie, and with Butler. His ""playoffs struggles"" are ridiculously overblown. His limitations and the way good defensive teams can limit him have absolutely nothing to do with the playoffs (or the second round of the playoffs, which is what people really mean, because he had no problem with the Heat and the Nets, who were not as good defensively as the Celtics and Raptors).  People act like the Playoffs are this completely different sport but the fact is the way Ben succeeds and the way he struggles in the regular season will be the same as the playoffs."
"Anthony Bennett, Ben Simmons (DNP), MKG, Derrick Williams, Evan Turner, and Markelle Fultz could all be at least argued to be worse."
"I looked it up, and Ray Allen has 13 games with 40+, Paul 21, and KG 4.  Obviously we need to adjust for pace slightly, but I‚Äôd say it be one of the games of his life for KG. He managed it roughly the same amount of times per season as Ben Simmons."
"Is the team good or bad? If they are bad then Trae Young but if they are already good then I'd probably take Trae Young.  Who would you rather take if you are trying to win games, Ben Simmons or Rodney Hood?"
Hardens choker label is misleading it‚Äôs not even real at this point. Obviously the same with lebron. Both lebron and harden don‚Äôt compare to Ben Simmons struggles. Giannis it‚Äôs true has his issues in the playoffs. But giannis is also way better than Ben.
The playoffs does not expose everyone lol. You are in denial if you think everyone gets exposed like Ben does in the playoffs. Ben has a very specific problem in the playoffs. Also the league half the time gets the all stars wrong. That‚Äôs a dumb way to evaluate it. If Simmons is dropping off from 16/7/7 to 12/7/7 in the playoffs then there‚Äôs an issue.
Rookie Ben Simmons was something else as a passer. Man gave me Magic vibes on the daily
We do this every regular season with Ben Simmons. Everyone gets so upset at anyone who criticizes him and gets real about his limitations. But then in the playoffs Ben will be exposed and everyone will act like they knew this would happen. Then the cycle will continue. Every year the sixers wait to trade Ben they will regret it. The league will only continue to realize how he is overrated and not worth as much as people think he is.
There are so many rationalizations about why ‚Äúit‚Äôs fine that he doesn‚Äôt look to score more and be more of a scorer/attacker‚Äù from ‚Äúthats not his job‚Äù to ‚Äúhe does so many other things‚Äù etc.  At some point it just becomes obvious this team needs him to do that and it clearly puts them at another level when he does. Tobias Harris is hitting shots this year and has a cool TS% but there are just a lot of limitations that come with relying on him the way they need to. Everybody knows Simmons has limitations point isn‚Äôt to rely on him to. It just comes down to the ‚Äútake 9 shots and focus on playing defense and throwing cool outlet passes‚Äù Ben Simmons=Assured early round exit for Philly
"Yeah I feel like that tier should be for guys like Jerami Grant and Malcom Brogdon, not Ben Simmons."
"If LaMelo will only ever be Ben Simmons without defense, that‚Äôs still better than being Hasheem Thabeet 2.0 a la James Wiseman lol"
Ben simmons has to some where on the list. As a sixers fan I'd say tier 2 as a nba fan tier 3
So I‚Äôm assuming you forgot Ben Simmons
Why would KAT demand a trade from the dubs? Playing with Steph Curry amd Draymond for a chance at a title?  And how many young players are available? I cant really think of many better than eiseman off the top of my head who might be out there. Maybe guys like Jaylen Brown and Ben Simmons but they would have shitty picks attached and are both not really on the minny timeline if they trade KAT. They need a lamelo or a trae young or someone 21 and under to pair with Edwards and those picks
"Because 2 of those picks are as good as they will get and wiseman might be as good a young player as is available. Maybe you can find a better young player to trade for but its going to be hard to beat Wiseman and those 2 picks. Maybe they fall in love with a player pike ben simmons and value 7 mediocre picks over 2 great picks and 2 mediocre picks, but wiseman and 4 picks is a haul for any player if it involves the minny pick and the warrioirs picks this year"
"Imagine saying luka was a worse player than ben simmons or booker or tatum after his rookie season with the mavs because the older players had more all star appearances and had playoff experience.  Its the same thing here, lamelo‚Äôs flashes are similar to what luka did in his rookie season.  and as much as a great player tatum is, the games future superstars would be tall point guards who have exceptional court vision and can score really effectively while making everyone around them better and changing the culture of an organization.   Its like drafting a franchise QB vs drafting a generational talent at WR"

"Ben Simmons jumpshot, Harden‚Äôs weight, Chris Paul‚Äôs height, Klay‚Äôs handles, Lillard‚Äôs finishing from before 19-20 and Lillard‚Äôs defense."
Ben simmons half court offense
Ben Simmons‚Äô three!
"These are the guys I consider to be the elite elite defenders in the league. Could be missing a couple:  1. Ben Simmons 2. Rudy Gobert 3. Draymond Green 4. Anthony Davis 5. Giannis Antetokounmpo 6. Bam Adebayo 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Jrue Holiday 9. Marcus Smart 10. Jimmy Butler 11. Lebron James 12. Mikal Bridges 13. Joel Embiid 14. Robert Covington 15. DeJounte Murray 16. OG Anunoby 17. Myles Turner  I think Marcus Smart has been tangibly worse this season and couple of those next 5 guys have been little better, but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt."
"The flipside of this is Ben Simmons, who doesn't flop at all and rarely gets calls despite contact. It's messed up that I want him to start flopping because of the way the rules are."
"Ben Simmons wayyyy too high, Trae Young wayyy too low, also Jamal Murray is too low as well, feel like his lack of All-Star appearances hurt him, he's been an All-Star caliber player this year when he's not injured and he was a superstar level player in the bubble.   Also just LOL with LaMelo over Tatum."
"""If he can rebound he doesn‚Äôt.""  That's what I was saying, at least not on defense. Instead he is asked to quickly get back on offense, because we have very good rebounding guards, like fe said 6.5 guy.   I'm not saying he's a great shooter, but to say he can't shoot is just wrong. Sure he doesn't shoot midrange, but who really does outside of some specialists (like KD, BI, Tatum, Leonnard, DeRozen...) and 90s players? What a weird point to make in 2021. I already said, he doesn't shoot much, but here and there he shoots a three and he hits about 35%. Not great, but also not really bad either. (Remember his debut?) He sure isn't Duncan Robinson, but he also isn't Ben Simmons. It really is not that complicated."
"Best way to determine it is a combination of different aspects that make athleticism. For example explosiveness and agility are good ones. Westbrook, Lebron, Jimmy, Giannis, Ben Simmons are are agile and explosive. There is nothing physically they can‚Äôt do on the court. Meanwhile Steph, Kyrie, etc. are not explosive but are agile and can move. They don‚Äôt out jump guys for boards or dunk on anyone. They can move but they don‚Äôt have that explosive burst. Everyone in the NBA is athletic in some vein but at that point you are separating kind of athletic and top tier peak athletes."
Ben Simmons
"No, they would still miss it. Steph is averaging 40.7 points/100 possessions. Kobe only scored at a higher rate than that once in his career. If you cherry pick that season, 05-06, Kobe is still scoring at an 8.3 TS% lower efficiency than Steph, which is a huge difference in efficiency.   Steph has played well enough offensively, that even cherry picking the best Kobe probably makes their offense worse replacing Steph.   Their defense would improve a little bit, but Steph is a good team defender as is and Kobe isn‚Äôt like a Mikal Bridges or Ben Simmons level of defender or anything.   This Warriors team is terrible. Even adding LeBron or Jordan to this team probably doesn‚Äôt improve them much, the guys on the team just have such bad skill sets that there is only limited ways for a star to improve their teammates on this team."
Ben Simmons
"&gt; Like the actual take of ""Lamelo is Simmons without the defense"" is beyond ridiculous.  I said that was his ceiling. Don't quote me if you can't get a basic recap right.  &gt; The fact that Lamelo spots up for 3 and shoots off the dribble makes him an entirely different type of player than Ben Simmons.  Yes thank you for repeating what I said but less clearly. Lamelo shoots a little above league average for 3 and everyone loses their mind, meanwhile he is an oversized PG with a pass-first mentality and a very good playmaking ability. That puts him much more in line with Simmons (or Luka), which is what I said."
"The fact that Lamelo spots up for 3 and shoots off the dribble makes him an entirely different type of player than Ben Simmons. It's not a matter of defense and saying ""one can shoot and the other plays defense"" is utterly moronic. Lamelo is closer to a Luka type game than he is to Simmons. Like the actual take of ""Lamelo is Simmons without the defense"" is beyond ridiculous. There's nothing else to it."
Lonzo and Ben Simmons should workout together this summer
"‚ÄúHe‚Äôs Ben Simmons except he‚Äôs almost nothing like Ben Simmons, however... they both are tall!‚Äù  What a truly idiotic take."
"Sure can, but he can't finish at the rim like a 6'10'' Simmons can (and never will). Scoring wise, his ceiling is slightly better than Ben without the length or size."
"The narrative is an argument, yes. But not all arguments result in a narrative. The difference is that the narrative gets traction and that traction adds extra ‚Äúlegitimacy‚Äù that other equally or more valid arguments do not get.   Simmons‚Äô narrative is just like you described it. But it‚Äôs an argument that doesn‚Äôt find nearly as much objective support as you‚Äôd expect. He‚Äôs maybe the third best defender on his own team and both Poeltl and Capela have been more impactful defenders than Simmons this season. The difference is that Simmons has a narrative that people have bought into (based on a plausible, if not compelling framing). It‚Äôs not unique to Ben, but it‚Äôs an example of what he has that Poeltl and Capela do not."
Agreed. And then they should trade Curry for Ben Simmons and jumpstart their rebuild.
&gt; It wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if LaMelo wasn‚Äôt so good  Lemalo's ceiling is Ben Simmons minus the defense.
why would we trade ben simmons to the twolves lmao  we‚Äôre one of the few teams in the league that already have a better center than KAT
Why would philly trade ben simmons?
"You‚Äôre not getting ANT for Ben. Jesus. Ben is a train wreck during the playoffs against good teams, and he will always be that way. Y‚Äôall are really overestimating Ben Simmons."
Ben Simmons gets called for two fouls on that forearm shiver
I think Ben Simmons just enjoys hurting people lmao. Explains why he loves defense so much. I think he just really dislikes offense.
"Poeltl's playing 25 minutes a game, Capela just straight up isn't that good a defender.  Ben Simmons is a versatile, high impact defender on an elite defensive team and he's going to finish, like, 3rd or 4th. which is totally reasonable. They aren't suffering from an absence of narrative, but an absence of arguments; 'narrative' never seems to refer to anything except arguments (or their absence) that some doesn't want to acknowledge."
Many of us philly fans are perfectly happy to have Simmons and love what he brings to the team.   The anti-Ben crowd has been a notably loud group from the get go though.
Ben Simmons on the '21 Sixers
"Ben always does this, he's hot when all star voting comes in, and then he just gets by the rest of the season. He feels satisfied enough being an all star. Postseason comes along, and he's Kwame Brown. This is why I never blamed the Rockets for tanking rather than getting Simmons in the Harden trade. Why the hell would you pay 5yrs/170mil for a guy that averaged hasn't even averaged 20 points in a single season?"
"It goes both ways. Shaq can't explain to you Embiid's shot selection or playstyle because in Shaq's mind, its basically ""dude is a giant, why doesn't he just body the defender every time"". But someone like Zach Lowe can tell you that Ben Simmons can't shoot so help defense can be afford to sag more for Embiid post-ups (just an example, not an actual take). RJ and Steve Kerr can do that because they've spent most of their career playing on the bench and took the time to study the game beyond personal experience thats limited to them but most NBA players turned TV personalities don't do that so whatever little insight they give tends to be personal anecdotes that doesn't hold up"
Ben Simmons‚Äô scoring is a fundamental flaw...   Sample size: whole career
"Ben Simmons, Andrew Wiggins."
Ben Simmons
"Ben might be a generational athlete (he probably is) but you also need a generational skill level to be that superstar.            It‚Äôs baffling to me that In the NBA someone like Ben Simmons is labeled as a generational talent, but someone like Luka isn‚Äôt (I‚Äôm talking about during the draft)."
Ben Simmons wishes he was 6‚Äô10 Westbrook.          Ben is like Draymond in regular season and Dort/Andre Roberson level in playoffs.
Is he that great in regular season? Would a team built around Ben Simmons as the best player even be better than a team around someone like DeMar DeRozan?                 Ben Simmons plays at a Draymond level in regular season and slightly above Andre Roberson/Dort level in playoffs.             That‚Äôs obviously still a very valuable player but frankly not as highly as Simmons was touted to be.
This is who Ben Simmons is.  He had a good 2 week stretch but he‚Äôs a career 15/7/7 guy.  Not a player to build around
The 21/8/8 is an outlier. Ben Simmons is a career 16 PPG guy who turns into a 13 PPG guy in the playoffs
I wish Ben Simmons a very good playoffs despite having no half court offence whatsoever
"For all-defense (1st or 2nd team), restricting it to just forwards, there's Giannis, Mikal Bridges, Kawhi Leonard, OG Anunoby, Paul George (sometimes), Ben Simmons (sometimes), and this season, LeBron James.  I'd throw Pascal Siakam in there too, but I'm a homer, and our defense this year isn't really good enough to justify it."
I discovered Ben Simmons can‚Äôt shoot threes when I played the 76ers in the playoffs in 2K. Realizing he didn‚Äôt/couldn‚Äôt shoot from further than ten feet from the hoop made it a lot easier to guard him lol
"AD and Ben Simmons and Giannis in whatever order. Gobert is amazing, but he can't play against certain line ups...like they have to physically take him out of games. To me, those threes versatility goes above and beyond Goberts dominance in select scenarios. Just my thoughts."
Ben simmons
"Simmons can gaurd 1-4 with ease. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúguard defense‚Äù just because simmons nominally plays guard.   Who the fuck is undervaluing shooting and shot creation? Those are literally the two most valued traits in the modern NBA (with the third probably being switchable, versatile defense, which is why ben get so much credit for it)"
"He‚Äôs a defensive role player in the playoffs vs non-fodder teams (Orlando, pacers, Charlotte are examples of fodder). We saw that vs the raptors 2 years ago, and the Celtics 3 years ago. A Ben Simmons ball handler isn‚Äôt good.  To get him I need to get out 30 mil in salary. I don‚Äôt know what playoff contender has 30 million in salary that   Can be traded for a PG that is dead weight on offense. Nobody is giving out 3 picks for what is probably a lateral move."
Nah bro shot creating is not rewarded unless you shoot a high percentage and winning games and defense is highly rewarded that‚Äôs why Ben Simmons is shown so much love but he his career high scoring is like 18 pts
"Yes.  This is realistically Ben Simmons and there's nothing wrong with that.  He's still an All-Star caliber player and still very good at a lot of things.  Scoring is realistically never going to be his strong suit, but that's not the end of the world.  Perhaps that means he'll never be an MVP candidate in this league, but few are."
Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons is a different player though.  He's a PF who plays guard because of his skillset and versatilty om defense
"Jrue, Ben Simmons, Gobert, Giannis"
"Who? And why? Which team needs a ball handler that cannot shoot, and is basically a no factor in a halfcourt offense? His only plus attribute in the playoffs is his defense and age.   Would you give up even 2 for Marcus smart a few years ago? He was on a much better contract as well. One way defensive guys aren‚Äôt that useful unless they are big men.  There is no team that is giving up 3 picks for Ben Simmons."
"Casual fans vastly overrate scoring, so this sub tends to focus more on highlighting what casual fans don't.  That said, I don't think guard defense is overrated. It's all about net impact, scoring more points, making the opponents score less, and the difference between guys like Ben Simmons and guys like Trae Young in how much they improve their net impact on the defensive end is *massive*. More than the difference on offense? Eh, debatable, but making general statements like shooting is more valuable than defense is just wrong."
"Ben Simmons is a good shooter, he just impacts the game so positively in other aspects he doesn‚Äôt shoot lmao"
"Because some of us have players we want to see succeed. Like personally, if we don‚Äôt win, I‚Äôd like to see Embiid win but that ain‚Äôt gonna happen if Ben Simmons can‚Äôt develop a functioning offensive game. So yea, fans are gonna be upset when they see a player come into the league with all of the physical tools who plays the most skilled position on the floor, yet that player fails to get better at a single significant  aspect of the offensive side of the ball, which severely hampers his teams potential offensive output. The Sixers get by because Embiid is a god and Tobi has stepped it up this year but in the playoffs I fear we‚Äôre gonna get the same story with Ben as we‚Äôve always gotten."
Ben Simmons needs to be in that top 25. He‚Äôs far too passive for his skill set
"This has me thinking, is Ben Simmons ever going to surpass peak Draymond (2014-2017)? Green was an all-time help defender and excellent passer in the half-court even if he was getting left wide open from 3. Imo neither his offense nor his defense are as good as Green‚Äôs at his peak."
"Um, this isn't good logic.  Ben would have been an asset you could trade again to other teams for more picks ala what the Thunder are doing with acquiring and then retrading talent. You get sixers picks then you get picks for Simmons.  You opted to get Levert and Allen, which is still a good haul, but then you sold low on both for absolutely no reason outside of your owner being cheap as Allen was going to need an extension. Again you could have sold them for picks, but chose to get rid of them asap. The Levert return, in particular, is egregious."
Ben Simmons when he's on.
"He isn‚Äôt better than Ben Simmons or Russ, I‚Äôd argue his defence is more valuable than traes offence."
Ben Simmons so I could see his perfectly placed passes everyday
Why are you so obsessed with Ben Simmons
"it was never close, theringer.com just gave ben simmons narrative a big push and people though oh maybe its close  it never was"
"Yeah, Rondo was actually close to a serviceable shooter. Ben Simmons isnt on that level yet.  I used Rondo as an example because he could knock lots of threes in a row in practice, but games were different.  I think he should at least try, but I understand the reason he doesnt try in games is because hems terrible at it and it‚Äôs a huge negative."
Just because it‚Äôs you who posted this I‚Äôll call this Ben Simmons hating
no he's a habitual simmons hater. he goes into slumber for the stretches where ben plays well (or posts about how the other players on the sixers are good without including ben playing well) but when ben plays poorly he's the birdman meme
Draymond green is a good player but ben simmons has every single tool to be better than him he had the playmaking ability and the size plus the bball iq to be a good defender. He should be better than draymond green by every measure
I‚Äôm not sure if those numbers are good or bad for Ben Simmons lol
"The play of Ben Simmons will determine how far the Sixers go this year. I trust Joel and Tobias to show up, but Ben has not looked good recently at all."
Just say you believe ben Simmons is the best perimeter defender and try to prove it
We were watching the Sixers one time and my pops told me that he played like Ben Simmons because he also didnt have a jump shot  said that he didnt realize how bad it looked that he only played in the paint LMAO
Is it weird that I don't see Ben Simmons at all on this list?  I swear his entire game is all about driving and kicking out
Well at least that foolishness about Ben Simmons winning DPOY is done for.
"Ben Simmons because of his combined speed, height and wing span."
devin booker received the 26th most all star votes from fans. He received more votes than:   * Chris Paul   * Rudy Gobert   * Ben Simmons  * Kyle Lowry   * Nikola Vucevic   * CJ McCollum   * SGA  I'd say he is properly rated
"I appreciate ur technical input but it just weird to see a all time great that sucks on offensive side of the game in bill. U mentioned about his defense and passing, do u think these attributes are enough to justify that he is on top of the all time great lists? I mean someone like ben simmons who is elite on both categories is barely all star player nowadays.   So do u believe is it harder to win at that times or now?"
Embidd is more important for the sixers defense than Ben simmons so I have no idea how the hell would simmons win it
"Yes there is some irony, but Ben prides himself on 1v1 defense and shutting people down when he‚Äôs on the court whereas Gobert prides himself on protecting the paint which is where Simmons had all of his non FTs. There is a difference"
"I've personally thought that if the 76ers disappoint in the playoffs that a CJ for Ben Simmons trade would help both teams, but with Embiid playing as an MVP I imagine they'll be a tough matchup in the Eastern Conference Fibals"

Ben ‚ÄúCOVID-19‚Äù Simmons
"Oopsies, it looks like you‚Äôre wrong!  Ben Simmons won‚Äôt shoot 3s, so clearly he can‚Äôt even be an average player.  Never mind his elite playmaking and defense and he still scores at a very respectable clip on high efficiency, this guy is *trash*."
"Ben Simmons, you ma new favourite player! Guy has amazing defensive IQ and plays hard. Love him."
Ben Simmons also coaches his teammates on the court.  Frontrunner for Coach of the Year?  Definitely!

Ben ‚ÄúZach Lowe‚Äù Simmons
"Bro the Sixers just played Embiid 36 minutes against the Clippers because that is what was required. Like I said Doc plays his bench heavy minutes together and doesn't want any player playing a ton of minutes in the regular season if he can help it. Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris both average 33.3 mpg, Joel averages 32 with Howard playing basically all of his backup minutes when he's out there.   Again, that's just how the coach normally wants things to go, sometimes it's fewer and he plays 26-29 sometimes he plays 35-40. Just depends on the game. And obviously the playoffs they will play more as rotations shrink.   Jokic playstyle allows him to play heavy minutes, heavy games and not be at risk for injury. That's great, but Embiid plays pretty normal minutes for a 7'0"" 270lb center who is asked to do so much on both ends."
Ben Simmons makes me embarrassed to be Australian. The guy is a walking wanker.
"Okay, was Ben -13? I bet Ben defended who ever he was on pretty damn well.... was Embiid out? Why are you bringing this game up?   Ben's dfence has been pretty insanely good since he entered the league. It's hard to argue that any individual player is better when you have Irivng, HARDEN, and  DURANT!!!! 2 of the best 3 players offensive players in the entire world and you want to talk about DPOY?  I dont see many other players who are better overall defensively than Bem Simmons.   You guys probably think Durant is the answer.... lol"
Ben Simmons is an all-star and DPOY candidate. Nuggets have no one like this. Just stop.
"Ben Simmons lost the game he scored 42, and had a negative plus minus."
The point is it can be better then ben simmons
"That's possible, although I disagree about the playoffs effectiveness comment. Missing Ben Simmons vs the Celtics was a huge loss, and otherwise the Sixers have done well in the playoffs. I think the difference-maker is the Sixers' defense, which is a lot better than the Nuggets'."
"They don't own their pick for this season and don't own it in 2025. 2024 and 2026 are seasons where they just have to not be in the top 4 and they'll be golden. The Nets gave up their 2022, 2024 and 2026 picks plus their 2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027 swaps. Harden, KD have another solid 5-6 years well Kyrie has at least another 7 due to their skills not needing a lot athleticism. Even if they become 60-70% of the players they are now by the end of it, that's still a top 4 seed in the East so those picks are pretty much useless. I have no idea who thought trading a 26 year LaVert making 52 million for the next 3 years and a 22 year old Allen for a guy coming of an injury, who showed no interest in playing for Houston or non-championship contender on the last year of his contract plus another first round pick was a good idea but to flip him for a 29 and 30 year old role players really shows how far the mighty have fallen.   None of this gives me any confidence in the moves that front office is going to make in the future. And why have a bunch of picks who could be Ben Simmons (probably not though) and Thybul when you could have Thybul and Simmons plus like what, 2 less picks? The new owner probably just saw this as a cash cow opportunity but since the new tv-deal is going to more than make up for any of his potential losses in crowds."
"Well that's why I've been beating the drum for Ben Simmons or Lonzo Ball. Both guys who can actually dish out assists, score and call plays while playing defense. It's a great fit, but the 76ers ain't trading for CJ without trying to keep Ben. Lonzo is attainable but we'll see"
"15/8/7 for Ben Simmons, 21/4/5 for Murray, 18/8/1 for MPJ (and only getting better), 15/7/4 for AG. Jamal and AG are both solid playmakers but don‚Äôt need to worry about that when they play with Jokic who averages 26/11/9. AG fills the defensive gap, and both Jamal and MPJ are more lethal offensively. Btw I rounded up for all of these stats it need be.   To suggest that Simmons is a better 2 piece is entirely dependent on what you value I suppose but the nuggets get everything he offers and more from a more well-rounded starting 5."
"Tatum had a defensive rating of 105 his first two years. For reference, Ben Simmons is a DPOY candidate this year and his defensive rating this year is 106.  Herro's is 112, which is below average.  Defensive rating isn't everything, obviously, but Tatum smokes Herro on that end."
"he could play some back to backs but he'll never go a full season without load management. it'd be irresponsible to do anything differently  i'm glad you brought those 18 games up - 8 of them were because of that fultz injury i mentioned in my previous comment, and the other 10 were all load management. if you can win a few games without embiid (and thanks to tobias harris and ben simmons (and danny green for a couple of games), the sixers have been able to win without embiid this year so far) then the load management is way less of an issue"
"Depends on your qualifications. Do you mean expected combined careers, both players who you think will have a better career than the two of them, or how good the two of them look in the first 2 years.  Regardless, these years had great 1-2 pick combos (multiple all star teams, all defensives, all nba teams, or high scorer like KVH)  1960 Oscar Robertson and Jerry West  1968 Elvin Hayes and Wes Unseld  1981 Mark Aguirre and Isiah Thomas  1982 James Worthy and Terry Cummings (Dominique Wilkins was 3rd) making this a draft where 1-3 made multiple all star games and all nba teams  1992 Shaq and Mourning  1996 Iverson and Marcus Camby   1997 Duncan and Keith Van Horn  1999 Elton Brand and Steve Francis  quite a few busts at #2  Some recent notable 1/2 picks are 2016's Ben Simmons + Brandom Ingram and 2015's Towns and Russell  edit: the best has got to be 1960, then 1992 if we consider that both players need to be fantastic otherwise LeBron and Darko would be fairly high"
"They wanted a pick based package and heat didn‚Äôt have the picks.  If they wanted a player based package they would have taken Ben Simmons instead, who is a lot better than herro."
Notice how Sixers fans are blowing you up for pointing this out &amp; correcting you but are the same ones who said (as well as Simmons himself) that Simmons dropped 42 on Gobert and that's why Ben is DPOY
Don't you see the irony in this comment when Sixers fans (and Ben himself) have implied/outright claimed Ben scored his 42 points on Gobert when in reality Simmons didn't do shit against Gobert?
This seems impressive but I think I need Ben Simmons to weigh in before I make up my mind.
"Why does Ben Simmons, a good passer, simply pass the ball to the rim?"
"Be me, an NBA player with the ball   By some miracle of God, I am able to get past Ben Simmons  Dribbling for my life, fortune favors me as I somehow pass Thybulle  I swoop pass Harris by the skin of my teeth and enter the hole.   My Reward for thrice defying death?  The approaching shadow of Joel Embiid, blotting out the sun."
"Tim Bontemps: [Ben Simmons says he thinks Joel Embiid is ""clearly"" the NBA's Most Valuable Player this season.s=21](https://twitter.com/timbontemps/status/1383242549121355785?s=21)  Tim MacMahon: [Did you call him a jackass? ](https://twitter.com/espn_macmahon/status/1383242696060329987?s=21)  Tim Bontemps: [No, he had a coherent argument.](https://twitter.com/timbontemps/status/1383242880437735432?s=21)"
And the clown of the year goes to ben simmonsü§°ü§°ü§°
"It sounds like you don't want to hear anything that could potentially be negative towards the sixers. Joel Embiid is the greatest center of all time, Tobias Harris is the most clutch player of the decade, and Ben Simmons will have a complete offensive arsenal come playoff time. Hope you can hop off reddit in peace now"
"It worked out perfectly.  But that pass was born of fear.  I think Jackson was going for the intentional foul on Simmons, and Ben noped that pass to glory.  Worked out, but would have looked super dumb if it went sideways."
"The actual idea for the rockets FO was that a Wall, Dipo , Wood team is fairly close to a Wall, Wood, Ben team. If the team with Ben is an 7-11th seed, then with Dipo we may be an 8-12th seed. Obviously accounting for Hen‚Äôs poor fit. Now Dipo was ass and we had infinite injuries, forcing us to tank. But this way we would be in playoff contention, and get multiple extra picks. We offered a team friendly extension to Dipo for this reason I believe   I will be keeping my stance that we wouldn‚Äôt get better value for Ben than the three late Nets picks. I‚Äôm quite sure those will be at least lottery picks. Whether they turn into good players is up to our FO and luck   Not a good situation overall. But I am not sad that I don‚Äôt have Ben Simmons on this team. And I do hope us being forced to tank will give us back our pick, all up to luck"
"Clippers were not allowed to play a more physical game. You think because there was a single no call on  embiid and Ben Simmons got called with 2 offensive fouls that Clippers were out there doing whatever they want? Clippers were getting mauled going to the rim in the last 5 minutes of the game and the refs swallowed their whistles while blowing them on the other side. I‚Äôm not arguing about how many free throws embiid deserved or not, but at least be consistent and actually blow the whistles consistently."
"Ben Simmons is DPOY, why is there an argument  If Paul George got Joel Embiid's calls he'd score conservatively 700 points a game"
"There is no embiid stopper. Dealing with Philly comes down to what we do against Tobias Harris, Seth Curry, Danny green, Ben Simmons etc. Joel can do whatever he wants as long as we do well against everyone else, they are not beating us"
Ben Simmons
"Embiid was called for a flagrant for blocking Morris landing. Two minutes later, Cousins bull rushed a Milton 3, hit him and blocked his landing. No foul.  Ben Simmons was called for multiple offensive fouls for elbowing. Paul George was not called for a single one despite doing the same.  Ben Simmons was called for a tech on a play where Paul George initiated contact and held Simmons.  Rondo in a crucial Green FT, was standing at the line, touching him and talking to the refs in the lane for 10+ seconds. No delay of game.  Zubac tackled Embiid and sat on him during rebound opportunity. Nothing.  Refs were ass tonight."

"The east is way less competitive than the west... in the west the 76ers would only be 3rd... also they are now only 14-10 against teams in the western conference. The Nuggets are 3.5 games down from the 76ers and they have a much more competitive conference.   Embiid has also played so many fewer minutes (Jokic 1945 vs Embiid 1189), [but Jokic still has more win-shares per 48](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_advanced.html). The amount of mins Jokic has played shows hes a much more valuable part of his team than Embiid and is a much more effective player.   While Embiid has been playing well and is an excellent offensive threat also great on D, hes not as flexible as Jokic on offence and relies on ben simmons and other players, while Jokic can do anything the O needs him to do."
"Why does Ben Simmons, a bad shooter, simply learn how to shoot better?"
"Yeah embiid has a lot of media behind him this year and you can see it right now as he still gets mvp buzz. Now i fucking love embiid and he is my favorite player but he shouldn't be mvp now. I disagree on jokic being good on defense. He is good at certain things, strength game on defense, poking the ball out, small things but as a run protector he is bad, he doesn't contest at the rim but he can occasionally get a poke on the ball but that's about it. On the perimeter he is miserable, jumpy and can't change direction well. Now embiid isn't ben simmons on the perimeter but he has gotten much much better at stunting and containing guards when switched on to them and when hedging. Last year he got burned all the time to the point where we did exclusively drop coverage but this year he has been great. Jokic also is not great at help defense as much  Overall jokic has been better i think but if embiid played the same number of games, I'm taking embiid imo, but he didn't so jokic is mvp"
"What happened to Ben Simmons ""I am the DPOY"" and dont get me wrong, I like Ben and want him to win, but if he is gonna talk sh\*t, he needs to back it up."
i think he‚Äôs ben simmons
I know Ben Simmons gives you elite defense and some playmaking but I feel like to beat the Nets your gonna need  him to take more than 9 shots a game. There is no reason with Tobias out that he shouldn‚Äôt be closer to 18-20 shots to help Embiid.
"What the hell was that last defensive possession, Clippers?! Were they just hoping Ben Simmons was forced to take the FTs?"
Ben Simmons takes off on offense so he could play more defense
"Ben Simmons needs to enjoy his #25 while he can, because he's a couple of weeks away from being number 2."
DPOY Ben Simmons holding PG to 33 points and counting
"So rim protection isn't a part of defense? That's like me saying Ben Simmons is 'a great wing defender, Rudy's a great defender.' Rim protection is the most valuable aspect of defense, so that's why Rudy's defense is so impactful  I'm giving props to Simmons as he's the best at his position, but we don't have to tear down Rudy, at least now with arguments that don't really make sense"
ben simmons averages more FTA per game than PG
Ben Simmons would sell his soul for PG's whistle
Not so fast /u/Ready_Feedback_6303!  A Ben Simmons is a Ben Simmons but that pick could be anything.  It could even be a Ben Simmons.
Why did Ben Simmons ask for a screen so he could attack PG? It's those tiny little things that will matter come postseason time
"Rudy is extremely valuable in the regular reason though, he impacts opponent shot selection more than any other player by effectively eliminating the highest percentage shots. Embiid and Jokic kind of break their gameplan but that‚Äôs two players who nobody can really stop. Those stats are measuring regular season impact, so it‚Äôs not about playoffs. Otherwise Ben Simmons, Giannis and Embiid would be lower because they all have major scheme-related problems in the playoffs that they have yet to resolve, and Jokic, LeBron, Rondo and Jamal Murray would be higher. But it isn‚Äôt what the stats measure when we‚Äôre talking about the regular season."
"You realize you could've traded Ben right? The better deal was Philly no matter what but because your owner is a dumbass you got 50 cents on the dollar for Harden and are left with some picks that may or may not be good. Trading Harden for Simmons plus picks and then flipping Ben for more assets would've left you with more young talent and more picks. This is coming from someone who knows shitty ownership when he sees it, mind you."
Ben Simmons so fucken trash
That's because 3 pt extraordinaire Ben Simmons is running the point.
ben simmons in the title so lots of instant downvotes lmao this sub
Nobody has more unnecessary turnovers than Ben Simmons and that near TO of him trying to dribble through 3 guys in transition for no reason is exactly the type of thing that does it
"If Mike Scott somehow gets an NBA contract next year, he should give Ben Simmons like 80% of it"
DPOY Ben Simmons blocked PG...he heard us talking shit
Why would Nuggets fans not like Ben Simmons?
"time to extrapolate blame for this injury and place it at the fault of Adam Silver, the owners, LeBron, Ben Simmons, and the entire Lakers fanbase and organization."
"""I sit on the bench sometimes, which means I have to come off of the bench. That means I'm practically a 6th man. I'm 6th Man of the Year."" - Ben Simmons probably."
"Seriously? You really think the T Wolves would trade a reasonable amount of assets for him? What would a package even look like that would be valuable to both teams, especially when the Rockets are tanking and don't wanna take on more contracts?  And no, there's not up to 10 teams who'd realistically trade for Ben Simmons at this point, with his contract and clear stagnation as a player"
"1. AI for his time compared to his peers. I would argue Kyrie's skills are unparalleled (I also might argue that AI was pound for pound the most athletic dude in NBA history).  2. They are young teams. The Pelicans especially aren't expected to be good right away, not a lot of teams are good with a 2nd year player as their best player. Generally speaking, NBA players peak like 25-29 or so. They will be better next year barring injury.  3. Oubre and Kuzma because they are polarizing players on high profile teams. If they were on the Kings no one would have an opinion. Westbrook and Howard have been premier players for a decade and thus have lots of strong opinions about them. I'm not sure about Ben Simmons (except his shot is so bad people maybe fail to see his positivies?)."
SGA DORT Ben simmons  Roco KAT
Thanks for the link ill check it later however at a glance the problem should translate to overall teammates shooting efficiency TS% not just three point shots   There isn‚Äôt much mention of impact but percentages.   Then you look at players who have paint gravity‚Äîgiannis‚Äî and the ultimate perimeter gravity‚Äî Curry‚Äîand you compare them to *impact* and we see they‚Äôre not comparable (Defensive impact metrics) The problem for Simmons is that the only real thing he can do is drive which is his strong point. But he cannot shoot FT‚Äôs (which prevents him from physically dominating) or stretch the floor as a guard and cannot provide paint gravity as that is for embiid and the 4.   Sure ben can switch. That‚Äôs fine and dandy. But wee have numerous of those players in the league today.   It would be nice if he could develop a shot but that‚Äôs looking impossible
Name 3 teams that would trade 3-4 first round picks for Ben Simmons
I love how he has put in two absolutely dominant defensive performances after the shit Ben Simmons said.
Gg boys  Fuck Indiana  Fuck these refs  Also fuck ben Simmons
"If the point count is high, I look to efficiency. Kyrie was efficiently scoring that game. Ben Simmons didn't bother Kyrie. Kyrie got the best of that matchup. Nothing to be said. Move on."
Like Ben Simmons
"If I were a Rockets fan I‚Äôd be depressed I could‚Äôve traded for Ben Simmons and picks and then just traded Ben for even more picks than taking the scraps of the league in Oladipo, Olynyk, and Bradley."
"I‚Äôm with you and have had this argument 10+ times. Big picture team building perspective, making the choice to not marry ourselves to Ben Simmons could be the right move even if none of our nets picks are all stars.  Our own draft picks will be higher and we have flexibility to keep collecting assets and developing talent. We can go into win now mode when the time is best for us now.  If we had Ben, wed already be on the time frame of a limited max player who‚Äôs tough to build a team around.  We‚Äôd never replenish assets post harden era and be able to build around Simmons. our Young player, cap situation, and draft pick pipeline would still look like a past it‚Äôs prime team."
"r/nba: ""man I hate that players are too soft nowadays to talk shit, they would never handle the likes of Gary Payton or KG""  also r/nba: ""wtf Ben Simmons be more humble, so disrespectful"""
"If I were a Rockets fan Id much rather have the picks and be able to tank easier than having Ben Simmons, who is a stagnant asset"
"His team is really good. I would argue the 76ers are just slightly better (or were before the Nugs got Aaron Gordon). Tobias Harris is having an excellent season (at least as good as Jamal, probably better), and Ben Simmons is a top 2 DPOY candidate. It's debatable for sure, and I think it's close. I just think it's tough to give a guy MVP when he's missed 25% of the season, and likely more by season's end as I suspect Embiid won't play in every remaining game.  EDIT: Another thing to note is that LeBron has played more games than Embiid this year and doesn't seem to be in the conversation at all since his injury, despite having the Lakers playing arguably the best ball in the league while their second best player was having a major down year before getting injured for months."
https://thesixersense.com/2020/03/30/philadelphia-76ers-ben-simmons-best-3-point-manufacturer/  This was before Covid but that was a several year stretch.
"I'm not going to deny Draymond knows the game better than Ben, but Simmons is the top creator in open 3 point shots in the league. That happens to be a very important type of play."
Ben Simmons disagrees
I can‚Äôt stand Ben Simmons. I will die on the hill that he is not very good
It's wild to see nuggets fans talking up Ben Simmons lmao
"Some of you need to read what you're writing.  Ben Simmons FT shooting over the last 4 years: 56%, 60%, 62%, 62%.    That is simply not the stroke of a man who can shoot a basketball properly."
Ben Simmons is more accurate than Luka. Although cade is not the best on off ball defense and shot very well from 3 for us
"Ben Simmons continues to exude too-cool-for-school-teenager vibes. Nothing wrong with confidence, but he always seems weirdly confident as is."
they might even end up getting you a player like Ben Simmons! How crazy would that would be!
"I respect your attempt at farming karma from Sixers fans, but that‚Äôs just complete bullshit.  &gt;***Embiid said before adding Sixers teammate Ben Simmons is also worthy**. ""He's been a monster defensively all season. I do think he should win it. He has an impact on the court, especially every single night guarding the other teams best player.‚Äù"
I‚Äôd replace OG with Ben Simmons to have a secondary ball handler
"&gt;Anyone who thinks that Westbrook is a better player than prime bron because he got more mvp votes should just put the phone down. You clearly have no clue what you are talking about and it shows.  Your claim was that James ""was viewed as"" the best player in the league.  That's clearly not the case, since he had not won an MVP in five seasons at that point, and often did not even finish second for that award.  Those voters may have been wrong, but that's irrelevant.  That's how they viewed James between 2013 and 2018.  &gt;Rich paul himself told the Celtics that AD was a rental. Rich paul is ADs agent. I know it‚Äôs tough, but try to piece together what that means about what AD thought.   Holy cow are you dumber than a box of rocks.  Paul told **EVERYONE** Davis was a rental.  Including the Lakers.  Try and piece that together.  I'll help you, again.  It means the Lakers rented Davis for one season.  I already gave you the damn Rich Paul quote above, so you should know this by now.  &gt; It‚Äôs 3 picks and 4 swaps, therefore potentially 7 nets picks. Stop arguing semantics because you are losing an argument.   It's never 7 picks.  The right to swap firsts is not adding a pick.  You should refrain from using big words like ""semantics"" without looking them up first.  &gt;Houston didn‚Äôt value a player based package. They valued picks. If they valued players, they would have taken a Ben simmons package, and as we know, Ben Simmons is significantly better than anyone that the lakers traded.   All of this is inaccurate and irrelevant.  Houston refused to trade with Morey, as you should know.  It's also very questionable that Simmons' value is higher than Ingram's.  Simmons might be the better player today, but one of those players is improving annually, and still only 23 years old -- and his name is not Ben."
"To quote Vernon maxwell, ‚Äúif I knew you jazz fans had internet I wouldn‚Äôt have posted that‚Äù  what kind of whack ass bait is this lmao. You guys really care that much that an player opposing urs for an award thinks he deserves it? Ur mad that Ben Simmons and Joel embiid aren‚Äôt reading ur on/off stats and admitting publically that gobert is clearly superior? Even clicking this article once would reveal that embiid is using this more as self motivation than bragging"
Ben Simmons is a clown
yes but its a HUGE gap from that and Ben Simmons. Giannis is a better three point shooter than AD at this point. It definitely  helps the offense some
"Simmons was asked direct questions about DPOY also. And will continue to be asked them since we're in the middle of seven straight nationally televised games.   People just want a week straight of no comment from two of the most recognizable stars in the league.   For the record the first person to campaign for Ben to be DPOY, while hilariously noting that he doesn't campaign for players, was Doc Rivers. Ben was shortly thereafter asked if he agreed with his coach's comments."
"I don't think I've ever seen 2 guys on a team beg more for awards, Ben Simmons wants DPOY, Embidd wants MVP and DPOY. Next thing you known Simmons will want Curry's 3 point contest trophy."
Man that doesn't sound like it's gonna generate enough clicks tbh. Why don't we just....idk......cut out the whole Simmons part? Yeah cause then we have this natural sort of Ben vs. Joel thing we can allude to. Yeah let's do that instead.
There‚Äôs no such thing as clamping a supreme offensive player. The best defenders can slow them down. So yes ben Simmons iggy Lebron tony allen(for a young kd) kawhi(before load management) are some of the dudes who would best guard KD
Which one is with Ben Simmons?
"Wouldn‚Äôt really call him a point forward though, that‚Äôs more guys like lebron/Ben Simmons/Giannis, 4‚Äôs who more or less play the point  Edit: and Poku"
"My god man, no. It‚Äôs absolutely exhausting being in this subreddit trying to casually watch sports. I don‚Äôt have the time, and I choose to not use my day off spending an hour justifying Ben Simmons to some kid on the internet."
I think having Ben Simmons CP3 probably didn't think he would be the true pg of the team.  Sucks it didn't happen. I think we are the favorites with CP3.
Yeah but they didn't have anyone else who could really step up.   Tobias is yet to average at least 16ppg in a playoff run. Ben Simmons scores 16 on a good night and has obvious troubles once the game slows down in the playoffs.   They had to ride or die with Jimmy and Embiid. You need perimeter playmaking and shotmaking and without Jimmy they didn't have that.  So if he played well they played well. If he played poorly they played poorly.
"&gt; But I'd say there are many centers who can stretch the floor and keep the paint less clogged, opening up the lanes for cutters and drivers  I think to a certain extent this can be true of any player who stands on the perimeter. When people say you ""ignore"" non shooters on the perimeter it's mostly functionally true but its all relative, you always have to have some idea of where a guy is who is on the perimeter and account for him in some sense. Just completely ignoring Ben Simmons in a literal sense is a good way to give up back cut dunks to him. So again it's about what is the relative value of that vs other things a big can do  Posted about [this last week](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mr54zp/which_center_would_be_a_better_fit_next_to_zion/gukgwss/) part of the issue is Turner passes up shooting opportunities. This also just gets to the other point some of those clips in that link show that NBA help defense in general will commit to helping at the rim on drives. It's just the nature of how NBA defenses are taught to operate even if they are helping off 3 point shooters better than Myles Turner frankly. It's why truly ""opening"" up driving lanes as a spot up threat is hard and not as common as people think."
You‚Äôve mentioned Ben Simmons. Prepare for downvoted and get angry comments from high schoolers and nobodies

"When KD said it we didn‚Äôt see the defensive leap in Simmons that he took this year. Was still a great defender last season but wasn‚Äôt in the elite tier like Jrue was. Not to mention, since it‚Äôs KD‚Äôs viewpoint I can see his point if he feels Jrue is a harder matchup than Ben."
He also gave us Ben Simmons in exchange for his coup against Hinkie.
Is it missing Ben Simmons? Or just missing a third star who happens to be Ben Simmons? The World may never know
"The arguments you're making are just bad, that's what I'm getting at.    None of what you've said is a legitimately good argument for Ben Simmons.   Pointing to bad contracts to say Simmoms is good doesn't make sense.  Or pointing to an 8 game sample.    Like arguing against dumb points is not a good stance lol.    What about the 6ers offense? We have like 4 years of data to show that Ben as the lead handler leads to a middling offense.  Or that his defensive impact is more largely offset by his offensive short commings?  Like what does Ben Simmons need to succeed offensively? He has shooting at 2-4, and a Center who scoring 30 ppg and spacing the floor a lot.  Like how is it that a guy that largely makes his living on paint shots, free throws and transition on a stacked team only at a league average efficiency?   Like of course hes not a net negative player, but me saving that doesn't mean he can't be overrated."
Doesn't Embiid already play with Ben Simmons?
So what your saying is they missed DPOY candidate Ben Simmons. Thank you for proving my point.
"I don‚Äôt know why, but this comment cracked me up. Hit just right. Of course you aren‚Äôt Ben Simmons! lol"
"I hate when people make excuses for guys that wouldn‚Äôt make that excuse for themselves. You think Mitchell would ever say, ‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôm literally an awful chucker (34% from the field) everytime I play the sixers, and yeah I‚Äôm 2-6 vs Ben Simmons, but its because I‚Äôm 6‚Äô1.‚Äù"
I'm not Ben Simmons?
&gt; this is why single game +/- means nothing and you should quit using it  ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt Kyrie have like 37 last night though?‚Äù  ‚ÄúYeah but we won. His plus minus was negative too‚Äù - Ben Simmons
I'm gonna try to say this without too much sass: the worst version of Lebron James is better at almost all aspects of basketball than current Ben Simmons.
"And this news was posted on the college basketball subreddit too. Should the mods have removed all news about the Olympics, or Cade Cunningham, Luka Doncic, Ben Simmons, Zion Williamson, and Markelle Fultz prior to being drafted too?  I get where you're coming from but this sub has always contained small amounts of basketball news from outside the NBA when it's relevant"
"What the game was like 10years ago is different to today and how coaches use their best players. There so many factors that determine the minutes played.  For example, Embiid didn't have any 40+min games last year in the playoffs and only one the year before. Ben Simmons had two in 2019, same as Giannis who played more minutes than him overall.   AND Giannis was injured in last years playoffs.   Giannis has one of the best work ethics in the league. If conditioning was keeping him back he would be working on it."
"Can we finally stop the Simmons hate? Team looks confused and sucks at fastbreaks without him. Defensively they let the point of attack do whatever they want, Ben plz come back soon."
"I‚Äôm a Ben Simmons fan too, I‚Äôm almost positive the guy is trolling"
"Ben Simmons fans are just delusional like that  &gt;!""Just wait unitl he starts shooting 3s""!&lt;"
Ironically they‚Äôre better as a pair. Embiid opens the floor for Simmons and they can‚Äôt put a center on Ben if Joel is on the block. Likewise Ben always knows how to get it to Joel for entry passes and on defense they‚Äôre incredible together
LMFAO you'd compare ben simmons to 2009 lebron? i don't know what to say to you
You‚Äôve compared Ben Simmons to Cleveland Bron lol.
"Well, as elite as Ben Simmons is at passing and finishing, Lebron is just better at ball-handling, passing, playmaking and is an all time great finisher. Not knocking Simmons, it's just Lebron is  on another level and is at least willing to take and make threes to keep switching things up. That Ben is playing with Embiid needing extra space to operate in the paint only makes this worse."
If you watched Cleveland Lebron in the playoffs and Ben Simmons in the playoffs and concluded they were pretty much the same thing then there‚Äôs no saving you lol
Ben Simmons is the MVP
Ben Simmons is disrespected because his scoring is limited.  &amp;#x200B;  But Embiid has been amazing.  &amp;#x200B;  ....but Jokic has been better.
"""But ben simmons!"" - sixers fans probably"
"Bringing up Jrue is a fair point, but pj tucker? Really? I‚Äôm not worried about tucker. None of these guys you‚Äôre bringing up are winning DPOY, but Ben Simmons is."
We will just sign Ben Simmons in FA when it‚Äôs time :)
To be fair 15/11/6 with one made 3 is a great game for Ben Simmons
"Bucks fans, your win doesn‚Äôt mean anything. You all forgot that Ben Simmons has 8 arms and would have contained Giannis, Middleton, Jrue and Bobby with that tool tonight"
Rather face the bucks. One reason as to why I would rather play them than the sixers...Ben Simmons  (his defense).
If its only for defensive stop:  Ben Simmons and its not close  But if its to score also on the other end:  Jrue Holiday
Ben Simmons
"Ben Simmons, length is scary"
Bro it's a 9 point game and we don't even have Ben Simmons. Chill out bucko!
"He's like the submax version of Ben Simmons. Clear talent and winning player with major flaws, but someone will pay him."
Sixers fans crying over their defense being shit without Ben Simmons when the lakers been number 1 defense without AD and Lebron
"Which Simmons? Ben Simmons? HELL NO. He‚Äôs not even a first Tier Player. I believe Shaq made more 3‚Äôs than him in game. Hell Dwight definitely has more 3‚Äôs lmfao. Davis is a scoring machine when healthy. He can literally do everything. Not a chance. I wouldn‚Äôt trade KD for Davis he‚Äôs that good. Davis is still developing. He has won on all levels and got at least 2 more chips in him.   I‚Äôm not over rating anything. I watch every single Lakers game. THT is a STUD. He will at the least be a Jalen Brown level player. At best Ben Simmons type. He can actually shoot 3‚Äôs too. But he doesn‚Äôt get enough minutes for anyone to know for sure. Easily one of the most hyped / respected 20 year olds in the league. He mildly contributed to a championship LOL.    So tell me. Is CJ a star player? Is he getting better? He‚Äôs a career 20 point per game scorer. THT drops those all the time LOL. CJ is mediocre at rebounding. THT is above average. And they would probably the same assists if they had the same minutes. The biggest difference is THT is only 20. He has a far greater upside than CJ... CJ has a very small impact on the league as it stands. No one fears him. People fear almost every single Laker. We have a team where almost the whole roster can go off for 20 on any given night while half the roaster can go for 30 LOL. I get it everyone was injured last year... but he has to contribute to at least the second round for me to take him seriously. Dame and CJ got exposed with everyone else last playoffs. Even Kawhi and PG came up short. What makes CJ so special? He‚Äôs 29, 6‚Äô3, 190 pounds and is always injured. Really?"
"Forgot to mention the fact Ben Simmons isn‚Äôt playing, Tobias just came back from injury, also they‚Äôre on a back to back from just playing the Suns at home in a tight game, and the Bucks have had 2 day rest lol. But ok"
If your point guard was Harden I would agree. Unfortunately Ben Simmons makes the Bucks defensive scheme even better.           Philly just doesnt have enough offense especially when Embiid always gets clamped by Milwaukee.
This is a W for Ben Simmons‚Äô fans lol
"Way more to it than the eye test.   Our defense falls off 4 points per 100 when OG isn't on the court. Philly's defense gets better by 1 point per 100 when Ben sits. staggering Embiid, although probably has something to do with that.   [Defensive RPM](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/sort/DRPM/position/5) has OG performing considerably better as well. Going by eye test and stats such as DFG%, Ben Simmons seems to be the better man defender at the moment, which could be the reason why the eye test might favor him, as man defense looks more riveting... but it only captures one aspect of overall defense. Given Ben's higher offensive burden, I think OG has played more consistent overall defense this season. Both are very good still. Neither should be DPOY though, Gobert has this wrapped up."
"I‚Äôm literally talking about the quote from Danny Green, who played with Kawhi Leonard, comparing Ben Simmons‚Äô defense to Kawhi Leonard‚Äôs  go tell Danny Green that it‚Äôs outlandish! I have to go make dinner"
Ben Simmons is too big to get over screens. Philly still gets cooked
Well assuming Ben Simmons is healthy he would be defending a lot of PnR so they wouldn‚Äôt be killed with them like they were last year
"If your definition of having a good outside game is that lax, then basically any backcourt player by default has a good outside like Ben Simmons"
"I wouldve done that instantly for the 76ers before this year, but Tobi somehow gets better and better every year.  What about some kind of package for Ben Simmons?"
Tyler Herro   Jimmy Butler    Ben Simmons   Zion Williamson    Pascal Siakam
"Zion is great but doesn‚Äôt contribute to winning yet. There‚Äôs a huge difference between good stats and good leadership. Which is why KD isn‚Äôt respected they way he‚Äôs want to be. Zion is useless beyond the ark currently because he‚Äôs stat padding under/ near the hoop and he‚Äôs not a center..  similar problem Ben Simmons has. If Ben could hit at all from behind the line we‚Äôd be talking about him too lmfao. Julius Randle has always had a pretty complete game. But he hasn‚Äôt proved himself in the playoffs yet. So many have great regular seasons then get completely exposed in the playoffs. Dame literally won a single game this past year. Still a great player but durability is a major factor people forget.    To answer your question. I‚Äôd trade Mitchell, Luka and Tatum for Jamal. If Olidipo comes back to form he‚Äôs a similar player."
Per Ben Taylor's passer rating model (Scale of 1 to 10):   &amp;#x200B;  1. Jokic (9.5) 2. Lebron (8.4) 3. Trae (8.4) 4. CP3 (8.0) 5. Lamelo (8.0) 6. Simmons (7.2)
He had dumb fouls in his first year but he‚Äôs been getting better at seeing his matchup‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses. He doesn‚Äôt go for pump fakes as much and tries his best to keep his matchup in front.   Defenders who allow the lowest shooting percentage in the NBA:  Matisse Thybulle - 38.0% Ben Simmons - 41.7% Rudy Gobert - 42.8%  Thybulle is also:  1st in defensive +/- 1st in steal % 1st in deflections 3rd in defensive rating 9th in total steals 186th in minutes per game
The only criticism I have of Matisse (besides his inconsistent/nonexistent offensive game) is the small fouls he commits every now and then. But as you said both Sixers coaches in the past 2 years have trusted Thybulle to guard some of the best competition in the league and he has delivered great results. Watching the Ben Simmons and Thybulle lead 2 - 3 zone defense earlier this season was a thing of beauty.
I was thinking about this the other day. Why is Westbrook protected more than Simmons? They feel like very similar players while Ben is better at defense
Because Tatum gets clamped by Simmons? Tatum hasn't done much vs the Sixers after the play offs in 2018 when Ben is playing.
Better then Ben Simmons?
Is that Ben Simmons son? They grow up so fast
Ben Simmons
"Yeah Jo and Jimmy were and are incredibly tight.   Ben and Jimmy seemed to get along well personally, but both took issue with Brett Brown taking the ball out of Simmons‚Äô hands and having Jimmy run the offense in the playoffs, mostly because they hadn‚Äôt been doing that during the season. Jimmy mentioned Ben was frustrated by that and basically said he would be too in his position.  The Sixers mostly just fucked up by not giving Butler the unquestionable full max. He‚Äôs a massive asset to let go and only get Josh Richardson in return, and Jimmy only seemed to want to leave after they were wavering on him and reportedly asked if ‚Äúthey could control him.‚Äù   Despite the imperfect fit, Ben/Jo/Jimmy were incredibly good together."
"As far as record goes: The Lakers are also missing Anthony Davis while the Sixers have had Ben Simmons, the Sixers are in the East and the Lakers are in the East  As far as Embiid: Playing better than who? I don't think LeBron should be MVP either"
There has been 0 improvements to Ben Simmons shooting since he arrived in the NBA. 0.
Doubtful since Ben Simmons isn't even the best defender on his own team.
It actually is that simple. Practice. I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôll be Curry but there‚Äôs no excuse for Ben Simmons to not be attempting 3s...working on free throws.
I can‚Äôt stand when fans assume these guys don‚Äôt work on their game. Ben Simmons is a hyper athletic very skilled player. You make it sound like he rolls out of bed and just shows up to the game. A large majority of these guys bust their asses their entire lives to reach the pinnacle of professional basketball in the entire world.   Shaq is one of the most skilled players the league has ever seen. I‚Äôm not even gonna address that one further
Ben Simmons cares more about his brand
He says he took 3s the same reason why Ben Simmons should take 3s. Knowing he'll hit every now and that he'd even attempt them for that matter meant people had to cover him no matter where he was on the court.
Chris Paul &gt; Nikola Jokic &gt; Westbrook &gt; Trae Young(never watched) = Ben Simmons(never watched) = LaMelo(never watched) &gt; Lebron James.
Yea I think Ben Simmons got it on lock
"He would definitely be a top 5 offensive player, but people forget how bad he was defensively. Some of Larry Bird's best trash talk is about Dominique's defense. Considering how perimeter defense is way harder now, he would probably struggle a lot on that end. And unlike his time when big men dominated, wing players like him reign supreme now. Whatever advantages he would benefit from today's game on offense would be negated by the disadvantages on the defensive end.   Like everyone else said, his shooting wouldn't be a problem. He'd get to the rack every single time. It's not like he's Giannis or Ben Simmons either, in fact he's a better shooter than a guy like Jimmy Butler. His shooting wouldn't even come up in his criticisms. Like I said, his defense probably would.   He probably wouldn't have reached the Conference Finals in this era too. Even if it is not the case with CP3, I feel like we would've done him dirty about it too. I feel like we wouldn't have appreciated and respected him as much. The reason I think that is because every year he would lose to a team that had a comparable wing player like LeBron or Kawhi or even the likes of Tatum/Brown and Jimmy. There are no such guys to compare with CP3, only Steph and there were no such guys to compare Dominique back then only Bird."
Ben Simmons  Over-hyped role player who somehow already made three all-star games and all-nba.
"Well yeah, but I‚Äôm saying if Ben Simmons is up there in the DPOY race, and OG isn‚Äôt, the. Simmons will 100% get the spot over him"
"Better than Dort imo because of better versatility. Ben Simmons I‚Äôm not really sure, he‚Äôs probably gonna get the first team nod over og this year"
Rj ‚Äúdon‚Äôt call me Ben Simmons‚Äù Barrett
Ben Simmons? Dort?
Idk man Booker just hates Simmons haha  But seriously it's fucking wild like every game booker and bridges ball out vs Ben
Facu knocking over Ben Simmons
"Nah, the real thing is the Rockets wanted to send Harden to where he wanted to go and that was Brooklyn. The best pieces of that trade came from Cleveland.   Or are you saying Caris Levert is better than Herro or Ben Simmons. Hell, they asked the Celtics for Tatum lol"
ben simmons would‚Äôve made itüíÜüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"He either shoots like Steph Curry or Ben Simmons, no in between"
"Ben Simmons leading the league in random misplaced hate from fans  like what does he have to with OG lmao, who‚Äôs a phenomenal defender in his own right"
What does Ben Simmons have to do with anything?
Let's be real if Ben Simmons played booker would of dropped like 35 dude seems to play with a vendetta everytime Simmons plays
"Better defender than ben simmons, but he doesn't go around begging the media for votes so that's not a popular opinion"
LeBron  Curry  KD  Harden  Kawhi  Giannis  Embiid  Jokic  Dame  Luka  Paul George  Kyrie  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Trae Young   Julias Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Ben Simmons  Zack LaVine  Nikola Vucevic  Bradley Beal  Rudy Gobert  Donovan Mitchell  Anthony Davis  CJ McCollum  Demar Derozan  Zion Williamson  Brandon Ingram  DeAaron Fox  SGA  KAT  He‚Äôs better then 15 of these guys? No. Cmon bro.
"LeBron  Curry  KD  Harden  Kawhi  Giannis  Embiid  Jokic  Dame  Luka  Paul George  Kyrie  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Trae Young   Julias Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Ben Simmons  Zack LaVine  Nikola Vucevic  Bradley Beal  Rudy Gobert  Donovan Mitchell  Anthony Davis  CJ McCollum  Demar Derozan  Zion Williamson  Brandon Ingram  DeAaron Fox  SGA  KAT  Sabonis  Which five guys is he better than?  I think he has an argument, but it isn‚Äôt easily."
Ben Simmons game winning 3
Ben Simmons is shaking
If you pair him with Ben Simmons they‚Äôd be unstoppable defensively.   Then they could try to get Tobias Harris to add 3pt shooting and shot creation.
Ben Simmons just isn't playing
Ben Simmons literally throats himself to win DPOY. Fohw
daniel gafford really just dared steph to shoot there like he‚Äôs ben simmons
he ruined ben simmons relationship too
Kendall Jenner telling him to go off on her ex Ben Simmons
In what imaginary world you live in would either of those offers move the needle in the slightest for Ben Simmons?
Rudy Gobert and Ben Simmons  Paul George and Doc Rivers (or PG and Seth Curry)  Lance Stephenson and Lebron
Ben Simmons sucks though
Ben Simmons hate =/= Rudy Gobert love haha
It‚Äôs valid lol depending on the post Ben Simmons has gotten a lot of hate too
Ok maybe I‚Äôve been blinded because I‚Äôm a Ben Simmons truther and I just selectively see all the Simmons hate and think everybody loves gobert lol
"Idk what Reddit you‚Äôve been using then lol between what Booker did to him recently, Ben Simmons comments about him being DPOY, or the dlo game winner this sub has been on his ass going all the way back to the shut down"
**Game Winning Shots**  Ben Simmons : 1  Steph Curry : 0
Can someone post a clip of the bulls broadcaster suggesting that outside scoring is ‚Äúprobably‚Äù the weakest part of Ben Simmons‚Äô game?
&gt; Ben Simmons with incredible hops and finishing ability  Except Simmons isn't awful on defense
Calling him Ben Simmons is just a polite way of saying he has no shot
‚ÄúBen Simmons hits a three to win the game!‚Äù ‚Äî the multiverse must be real
No they literally could not be more different players. Randle has evolved into a playmaking/shooting 4 while Zion is Ben Simmons with incredible hops and finishing ability
"If we're talking about point guards, Oscar Robertson already did it first. But yea I agree luka can definitely average a triple double, although I'd hesitate to even call him a point guard since he doesn't defend the point. Ben Simmons also comes to mind."
The Knicks have never beaten Ben Simmons  You better hope he never becomes a shooter
"Rondo was a much more prolific scorer and passer and worse rebounder   Not really what you're saying though cos it's extremely rare for a player to have games with low scoring and high rebounding/assists. Draymond is a very unique player in that regard, it's not like triple doubles are unique to Ben Simmons or anyone in particular"
"Eh, Ben Simmons hitting his first ever three, when that three is the first ever game 7 buzzer beater, would be insane"
"I think of old school rondo honestly. It's just so weird to me because russell is clearly better than draymond, and yet the op used a worse player comparison in this case. It's like lebron scoring a triple double and saying it's hyper Ben Simmons like. I guess that's the point of the hyper?"
"The problem is the league has had an influx of talent the past few years, and people can't separate that just because a ton of star caliber players enter the league in a short period doesn't mean Westbrook is a washed up bum because some of these young guys surpass him, while some of the other top players from his MVP season like Curry, LeBron, Davis, Durant, Kyrie, Butler, Dame, etc. haven't really fallen off.   Just since Westbrook's MVP season, we've added Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, Luka Doncic, Trae Young, SGA, Zion, and Ja Morant through the draft. Combine that with other rookie contract guys from his MVP season like Ben Simmons, Brandon Ingram, Jaylen Brown, Jamal Murray, Domantis Sabonis, Pascal Siakam, Towns, Embiid, Lavine, Capela, Oladipo, Jokic, Giannis, and Gobert all developing into star level players."
"Maybe, I feel like having Ben Simmons hitting a fadeaway three, that hits the rim 5 times, would be just so iconic"
Why not have Ben Simmons hit that shot on the other end of the court? Would be much more iconic
Westbrook is a stat monster. This isn‚Äôt necessarily conducive to winning. He can shoot better than Simmons (not saying much) but is not nearly the defender. He thrives with the ball and would cause a lot of the same half court issues the 76ers have with Ben clogging up the paint. You can‚Äôt place him in Philly and expect him to put up 20/15/15 like he does playing with Beal &amp; bad players.
I remember getting downvoted massively when I said Ben Simmons will have a similar career trajectory to Westbrook because Simmons wasn‚Äôt even as Westbrook‚Äôs level apparently because he was having a down year.
Ben Simmons
I gotta come harder I slipped up today don‚Äôt worry I got some great shit for Ben Simmons come playoff time
Ben Simmons needs to watch this on repeat. Let go of your ego and do something you‚Äôre terrible at until you‚Äôre better. Ben will never grow as a scorer if he‚Äôs not even willing to try new things in games.
Not only this but Ben Simmons went out for several games and Embiid's squad got squished. Like 0-4 or something? Meanwhile Murray went down and Jokic has still been on a tear.
"I think the Bucks are in the Suns/Jazz/Sixers tier, but the thing I like about them is that they‚Äôre clearly extremely self-aware and introspective about their past playoff issues and have been very deliberately using the whole offseason+regular season as a lab for working on fixing those problems. That‚Äôs a natural response to them having such high expectations the previous two seasons and then getting a ton of scrutiny when they didn‚Äôt meet them. The reason I‚Äôm skeptical of the Sixers is that I think they have really similar issues (no coincidence- as both of them have non-shooting primary ballhandlers that really struggle in the slower paced, more deliberate playoff halfcourt offenses), but the Sixers are much less often criticized for their playoff performance, because they got swept without Simmons last year and in 2019 they lost to the eventual champs on a buzzer beater, even though the best Sixers player on that team was Jimmy and Embiid struggled mightily on offense (17.6/8.7/3 with 28TOs and 37/34/84 shooting splits). But, the expectations weren‚Äôt there, and it seems like they aren‚Äôt really self-aware about it- it really comes off like they think they‚Äôll just be able to ‚Äúdominate‚Äù in the playoffs without doing much to fix their flaws. Namely, how to prevent offensive stagnation when reliant on post scoring from a player who still really struggles with doubles- Sixers have a 97.7 ORTG when Joel is hard doubled in the post, and how to prevent the offense from turning into a functional 4v5 when Ben doesn‚Äôt have the ball, which makes it really easy for teams to double Embiid. They also have an insane amount of defensive talent, great shooters, and a lot of talent that *might* just be able to overwhelm a porous East, but I‚Äôm just not really sold, and wouldn‚Äôt be surprised at all if Ben and Embiid get thrown way out of rhythm when they realize they can‚Äôt just run thru teams when they‚Äôre gameplanned against.    Nets are hard to rate- they should be in the top tier but I just can‚Äôt shake the feeling that they‚Äôre not going to have it all together, and at this point it‚Äôs no guarantee they‚Äôll magically all be healthy in the playoffs when they haven‚Äôt been all season. After seeing how the clippers collapsed last year, largely because of insufficient chemistry and rust, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the Nets run into trouble too. Again though, the East is pretty weak and all 3 top teams have major flaws, so they might be fine."
He‚Äôs legit the anti Ben Simmons and it‚Äôs great. Instead of being scared of something he‚Äôs not good at he uses regular season games to practice something he‚Äôs not great at and is making strides at it to the point you can see a future where he could be good at it.   Honestly I‚Äôm of the mind now that you have to at least be in his zip code now on these shots. Like you can‚Äôt just let him take practice shots from three anymore.
Ben simmons could have a case to win every award if you think about it
I think an easy way to do it would be to just not call charges unless the guy lowers his shoulder. I‚Äôd bet 90% of charge calls are flop by the defenders.   Last night I saw Ben Simmons fall over after either Lonnie walker saw what was happening and tried to stop his momentum. He barely made contact with Ben yet Ben still hit the deck. It‚Äôs just an obviously dumb act to reward. If you limit it to real plays where the guy is barreling through defenders with his shoulder down I think it‚Äôd be better. You‚Äôd also need to give defenders more leeway as well though.
Would it be wrong to add Ben Simmons to the list?
"How is this not on Keldon Johnson (#3) who just stood around watching as Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons run in for the rebound.  Absolutely no awareness there, he could have at least boxed one of them out."
Because Ben Simmons is your second ‚Äòall nba‚Äô player. He‚Äôs not a scorer. Also Dame doesn‚Äôt have Thibs as his head coach. If he buys into the system it really wouldn‚Äôt be that hard to even give 90% of Elf‚Äôs defensive value. All it takes really is effort.

"He‚Äôs not a good scorer because he‚Äôs not a good scorer.  I‚Äôve never seen an excuse like 76ers fans defending Ben Simmons. Yes he‚Äôs an amazing passer, he also is not a good scorer, and it‚Äôs not because he‚Äôs an elite passer lmao"
"Playmaking is hard without scoring too, you need to be a scoring threat to open up opportunities for teammates. Just look at Ben Simmons, people will say hes not a good scorer but hes just selfless, he averages 8 apg for his career which is 17th all time or something"
Who else tried to shoot with Ben Simmons on 2k and regretted it ?
"&gt;honestly who thinks about the Jazz enough to not like them?  SHAQ hahahaha  (edit: also Ben simmons lol. Weirdly picks fights with jazz players all the time for various reasons)    And I was sitting here knowing the point you were gonna make about golden state, but that's the thing there as well, no one believed in the warriors until they became THE warriors. Ppl shat on them and doubted them too before they became a dynasty, but the talent was already there.  ""Warriors always have sucked""  ""Steph curry is too small""  ""Their 3 pt shooting isn't sustainable cuz ______""  Ppl are just slow to give credit where its due.   And the rockets were 3 chuckers. The jazz are not. They're efficient as hell.  The warriors are not the exception. They were the start of the trend (because honestly, the nets are winning it this year and they're just gonna shoot all day long)   I'm not downplaying cp3 injuries. He's literally only been injured in the playoffs 3 times   https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-playoffs-2018-for-chris-paul-hamstring-injury-is-just-the-latest-bout-of-bad-postseason-luck/  (I didn't mean to say leg though. I meant hand. That was MB)  But hey, he is indeed old, if you just eliminate them cuz you think he gets hurt, fine.  But your whole argument against them banks on that.   Cuz the nuggets have a really really good roster. And your point was they don't have a number one scorer without murray, and they do. It's MPJ. They can, and are, overcoming murray's injury...so...that's why I think that they can overcome it, cuz it's what's already happening.   Because lebron did NOT carry the team 8 months ago. He had AD shouldering the load, which there is absolutely 0 indication AD will (or even could, since ppl want to blame the injuries to AD, if he's really hurt, he can't carry, and the points the same, whether he's just lazy now or actually hurt)  Lebron absolutely cannot just ""will"" the team to a championship if AD is this version of AD and you know that.   So unless you have a point on why AD is just gonna start lighting it the fuck up, that's the end of that lol.   &gt;no one on any team you mentioned has gone further in the playoffs did Portland did a year ago.   The nuggets were in the conference finals lol. The blazers lost round 1.  And even if you meant 2 years ago...the nuggets made it just as far lol.   Dame and CJ are TERRIBLE defenders. I'm gonna call you out for being lazy again cuz Mitchell has identical (actually slightly better) shooting efficiency than Dame does (Dame slightly better from 3 but they're, again, nearly identical)   Dame just has more volume.   Conley is a way more complete player than cj mccollum (does that really need to be elaborated on)   I'm not calling any of the 3, phx, utah, or portland's back courts as *the* best.   On any given night, any of the 3 teams might have the best back court, the gap is basically non existent."
"Let me preface this by saying that I'm not really trying to knock on Bam with what im about to say. Bams a fucking incredible player, these are my observations.   I'd argue having no 3pt shot is a big deal, in todays league you expect even Cs to be able to shoot 3s. Don't necessarily have to be good at them or shoot them a ton, but they do need to be a threat from out there. Bam quite clearly isn't.   Offensively is my core issue with Bam. He's efficient yes, and has good midrange shooting for what amount to a relatively small number of attempts per game. However he tends to be quite passive on offense, scoring mostly in the flow of the game rather than necessarily creating for himself at the rim or midrange. ~70% of his attempts come off of assists. He takes jumpers however it isn't off the dribble or anything fancy, with very few of his points relatively coming off of those. Given he's not your primary offensive threat, teams are happy to stick someone one on one with him (no double teams) and play passing lanes. Just because they can't respect his offense. Put Bam in a situation where he is the main source of offense, and it is going to be pretty horrendous.   All that SAID, that is obviously not Bam's game, nor does it have to be. It is absolutely okay for him to have such a basic offensive game, with no outside shot and not having to create for himself. Because he's not your #1 option, nor should be or should he need to be. There's nothing inherently wrong with him having these flaws in his game because that is not his role. It is however a flaw in his game, that IMO keeps him in the same tier as the other two. Bam makes up for that however by being one of the best defenders in the league, and a constantly improving playmaker for you guys.   Ben Simmons has a similar issue, in that he has no shot at all, however his playmaking and defense are elite.   Siakam falls into this category in my opinion because he manages to be very good at defense and playmaking, with his core flaw being an inconsistent (inefficient) offensive game. Albeit a better offensive game than Bam and Simmons. Part of The inefficiency comes with being forced to carry a bigger role on offense than Ben or Bam, which is due to the poor composition of the current Raptors team.   Tl;dr, Bam is elite at defense, a good playmaker, with a basic offensive game. Simmons is an elite defender and playmaker, with a bad offensive game overall. Siakam is a great defender, good playmaker, with an inconsistent offensive game.   Feel free to disagree, this is very much my own opinion."
Q: How many points did Ben Simmons score tonight?  A: Enough to win the game.
"That will never happen.   Not exactly sure why, but your comment rubbed me the wrong way.   Kd is kd and giannis is giannis. Kd is an all time great shooter, like quite literally top 10 all time. He‚Äôs special because he can do it while being basically 7 feet tall. A 7 foot Stephen curry would be a decent comparison. Giannis is extremely special and talented in his own way as well.   If you combine any 2 superstars where they fill each other‚Äôs weak points they‚Äôll obviously become overpowered. Combine Ben Simmons with Dame that‚Äôs overpowered. Embiid with Steph curry that‚Äôs overpowered. Jokic with Kawhi is overpowered. When the fuck would combining 2 superstars skills and talents not be overpowered?"
Ben Simmons the All-Star with another stellar night!  5 points in 35 minutes   20% from the free throw line
We will see what those Nets picks turn into years from now. Ben Simmons wasn‚Äôt taking this team anywhere and he‚Äôd leave in a few years. And lol y‚Äôall took Wiseman over Lamelo
Ben Simmons might be one of the the least average players in the league. Every single one of his skills and physical features diverges heavily from the average
Ben Simmons
"One of those plays Simmons drives in, draws a double team, dumps to Curry, Curry needs some help, gets the screen 1 second later from Ben and nails a wide open 3. No entry on the Statline for Ben for that play. But he turned a low % 2 into an open 3. He just makes the team better in ways that don't show up in a Statline."
Just say you don't like Ben Simmons and move on
Ben did good but who is that man under the rim? He boxed out two Spurs players and gave Simmons that easy easy! Good strong presence there. People remember the scorers but not the people that got them that bucket sometimes
"If Ben Simmons stays the same player he is right now, and plays another 10 years like that, he‚Äôll be a hall of famer"

#BEN SIMMONS
"It's not my response, I just changed Ben Simmons' comments last week around a bit.   Here is the original from Ben: &gt;  &gt; A lot of people get caught up in the fact Simmons is not much of a scorer. He entered Monday‚Äôs game averaging 14.8 points per game and with somebody of his size and skill, he probably should be averaging more points than that. &gt;  &gt; However, he doesn‚Äôt let the talk bother him. &gt;  &gt; ‚ÄúNot really,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think, at times, I probably did because I was too focused on what other people are thinking, but I know what my value is to this team. I know that I‚Äôm a huge part of this team, and if you know basketball, you see it when I‚Äôm out. It is what it is. Everyone plays their role and I‚Äôm playing my role right now. I‚Äôm trying to win.‚Äù &gt;  &gt; Simmons does a lot of things on the floor to create open looks for his team and that is what he is focused on nightly. &gt;  &gt; ‚ÄúObviously, my IQ to be able to get my guys open, setting picks, certain passes just little things that may go unnoticed to the average viewer,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúTo me, I know what I‚Äôm doing.‚Äù"

Ben Simmons you are my prince bruh I never slandered also don‚Äôt check my comment history
Ben Simmons shot wins the game. Have at it r/NBA
Ben Simmons just did more with 4 inches than I ever will.
Ben Simmons best case for DPOY is that he is considered a good player and it clearly isn't for his offense.
I would love a Sixers fan to give me an excuse on Ben Simmons play tonight.
The new owner is a man baby who chose Kelly Olynk and Avery Bradley over Ben Simmons out of spite and has destroyed the franchise within 2 years. Outside of the Knicks there probably aren‚Äôt many teams who wouldn‚Äôt lose tons of support over shit like that.
sixers have 2 max players with a triple single *combined* lmao  seriously people gotta fuck off with this ben simmons is an elite player nonsense
With Lebron and AD. If they had Gobert and Ben Simmons instead they get swept by Portland
"The short answer is that Ben Simmons doesn‚Äôt need to score. He is a facilitator first on offense, and he has plenty of teammates that can do the scoring for him. His defense is obviously crucial, but just because he doesn‚Äôt score as much as he could doesn‚Äôt mean he isn‚Äôt focusing on offense."
Randle but why does Ben Simmons live rent free in half of y‚Äôall‚Äôs head bro the man is elite at everything except one thing
Are you even an NBA player until someone makes a thread comparing you to Ben Simmons?
"What has Ben Simmons accomplished in the playoffs as the #2 option? Oh right, he got gentlemen swept by Tatum and brown."
"https://www.nba.com/news/nba-tells-teams-rules-will-be-relaxed-for-vaccinated-persons  The contact tracing part of the new rules will be a major benefit. Being flagged by contact tracing has been an issue for many players this season including Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid of the Philadelphia 76ers, both of whom had to miss the All-Star Game and the start of the season‚Äôs second half because a barber that they visited tested positive ‚Äî but they did not. Had they been fully vaccinated, they would not have had to miss any time even after being around someone who tested positive for COVID-19."
I disagree. Ben Simmons is a one-dimensional player who hasn‚Äôt made a leap since his rookie season.
Ben Simmons has a podcast?
Ben Simmons can't do 50% of what Giannis is doing wtf lmao.
Because they don't want him to turn out like Ben Simmons
"So I used to hoop... a lot. Even won the hoop it up.(These young bois dont know!) So I know what it takes for development (developing a left hand ain't easy).  Anyway,  Seeing Julius Randle develop a jumpshot literally pisses me off about Ben Simmons(Similar to Lebron earlier in his career... idk why I keep using parentheses). Imagine Ben with Randles jumpshot. Ben dont wanna put in the work and it's maddening.   Like bro, be better."
Random but that Giannis drive is an ex of why someone like Ben simmons needs a credible elbow pull up much more than a 3 pointer. And credible I don‚Äôt mean high % Giannis sure as shit ain‚Äôt shooting a high % on 12-15 footers this year
I think that if you consider LeBron a PG then Kyrie is clearly out of the top 5. I‚Äôd also personally say Ben Simmons is an overall better PG (though they‚Äôre such different players it‚Äôs hard to compare). Westbrook is also probably overall better especially this season.
Last time I checked 6ers only won 10 games when they tanked for Ben Simmons so nah it's not as bad

"If Ben Simmons always played aggressive, he would be a comp to zions style but with great passing and elite defense"
TIL that Domantas Sabonis has more triple doubles than Ben Simmons this season
"If you're suggesting I'm a Nets fan that's definitely not the case lol. In a perfect world Russ and the Wizards would knock Durant out in round 1. I dislike all of the Nets big 3 except maybe Kyrie; however, the sooner that NBA fans realize that this Nets team is just as OP as the KD Warriors were, the better. Nobody has a chance against them and Adam Silver needs to do something about KD ruining the league again. Maybe he really will after they go like 16-0/16-1 in the playoffs this year.  You can make an argument for Bucks/Sixers over the Celtics in the East if somehow the Nets disappeared, but I'll take the guy (Tatum) who has proven to elevate his game and be clutch in the playoffs.  Giannis has been fine in the playoffs when he gets to pick on garbage teams (ie Pistons, Magic) but when he plays against a good team he chokes (Raptors, Heat).  Embiid is really good, but people who think Ben Simmons is suddenly not gonna be a liability in the halfcourt offense in the playoffs this year are hilarious. I don't understand how they haven't learned yet."
"I think he‚Äôs 4th or 5th. You got Curry, Dame, Luka and arguments up for Westbrook or Murray. Ben Simmons is up there too but I don‚Äôt think he has enough in his bag offensively."
I think the mods should ban the use of Ben Simmons' and Bill Simmons' first name in posts and we should have to guess which one said the quote
Looking forward to seeing how angry people get about Ben Simmons being confident in his team üëç
I think Ben Simmons is still the favorite.
I fucking love Ben Simmons.
"This was good defensive recovery  Sure a paint shot might be higher % in a vacuum but this shot was way easier to generate and lower odds of a TO or offensive foul  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs because of a schematic preference for 3‚Äôs also, it‚Äôs bc ben picks up then doesn‚Äôt relocate off the pass so he‚Äôs basically not playing scoring offense anymore when he stands where he stood and knowing his skill set   If that were someone with a better jump shot and FT like embiid or AD it‚Äôd be different but Simmons is smart here to play to everyone‚Äôs strengths  Danny green bailed out the break by finally making space too, whereas Simmons had all but run into Harris lol"
Ben Simmons and Jared Bayless
It honestly looks like Ben Simmons is afraid to score.
"no.. the stat needs to be points off of missed 3s, period..... I am not against the 3s as a tool to be used to win basketball games..... I am an old head raised on big men in the post; I got it I'm old school... but I can appreciate the 3 as a weapon...  The over reliance on the 3-ball is just plain stupid and not good basketball in my book...... I think the Sixers winning the title this year will help to put a fork in a lot of ""truisms"" in basketball right now.  They have a generational big man in Joel Embiid... they have generational point guard in Ben Simmons... if they win the title they are going trash a whole lot of the current talk in the NBA..... I can't wait..."
"facts.  Ben Simmons biggest flaw is that he doesn't want to shoot, which translates to more shots for Embiid.  Russ' biggest flaw is that he shoots too much, which would mean fewer shots for Embiid.  Neither one provides a lick of spacing so that'd be a wash and Simmons is miles better on defense."
Ben Simmons is good lol calm down nephew
"Dis why people overrate those players from da 60's like Wilt and Oscar  Put Russ, Bron, Jokic even Ben Simmons in da 50s and 60s and they all averaging 40pt triple doubles."
Isn‚Äôt Ben simmons like 16-0 against the knicks?
"Embiid will always be a dick in my mind for punking Jarrett Allen in the 2019 playoffs and Ben Simmons looks like the Mona Lisa.  Can't lie though, you're uniforms are pretty fly"
Exactly like how Ben Simmons is like Magic Johnson... except worse.
you can do this with everyone  embiid and simmons together are on a 70 win pace this year but ben missed like 10 games and joel 19  it is hard to take this regular season seriously theres barely any matchups where both teams are healthy
Lakers are fucked if we make the finals against each other .  Ben Simmons will explode against Jared Dudley.
Dude this turned into a Ben simmons hate thread for easy karma. Stop making so much sense or you're gonna get downvoted lolol. Reading this thread you'd think the sixers were the 7 seed or something
"2020 was a wash because they limped into playoffs without Ben Simmons, they were never gonna make it out.    The 76ers won 52 games in 2017-18 and Embiid missed almost 20 games that season. AD never had a 50 win team on the Pelicans."
*If Giannis learns to shoot he's a goat candidate *If Ben Simmons learns to shoot he's a top 10 player
"&gt; Imagine thinking a comparison to a player is the same as saying they are exactly the same player.  Did you need me to name you every single thing Magic does better? Apart from stats you can even find full games to watch with your own eyes that he could score in a many different ways, unlike Simmons.  You: ‚ÄúYeah, he‚Äôs non-existent in halfcourt, but Ben Simmons is a basketball player. You know who else is a basketball player? Magic Johnson. Checkmate, atheists.‚Äù"
If Giannis learns to shoot he's gonna be great  If Ben Simmons learns to shoot he's gonna be great  If Russell Westbrook learns to shoot he's gonna be great
"Skill boost - Ben Simmons, 3pt shooting. Improves spacing and makes Ben Simmons ball handler pick and rolls so much more effective. Since Ben is already a good passer, he'd be pretty dangerous.  Honorable mention - Embiid, playmaking. Embiid is already extremely hard to guard, but if his playmaking was better he'd be laughably unstoppable.   Athleticism boost - Shake Milton. Shake has average athleticism I'd say. He's already able to drive well because of his craftiness and his length. Extra athleticism would probably make him a starting tier player as it would improve his scoring and turn his defense up a notch.   Height boost - Matisse Thybulle. Imagine have two Ben Simmons running around on defense lol. He'd still be shorter than Ben at 6'8"" but still. Honorable mentions - Seth Curry, being taller he'd get his shot off easier. Maxey, would probably immediately take over Shake's role with added height."
"Which is odd. Butler was like one shove. Dudley tossed Ben Simmons into the stands, tried to fight Embiid."
Being Ben Simmons' daddy
"Favourite player is KD, but play like ben simmons who isn‚Äôt afraid to shoot lol"
I sit on the perimeter and act like a 3 point threat and then when I get a pass I do a quick jab step and then just kick it back because I *am not* a 3 point threat.   so like a 5'10 ben simmons with no defense
"Ben Simmons: 5pts, 6rebs, 5asts, 2stls, 2-6 fg, 1-5 free throws  Game-winning tip."
"&gt; Literally everybody is a better shooter than Ben Simmons  this is what blows my mind is the sheer degree of how bad he is, there are LITERALLY better shooters in this thread, and that's a problem when he's your max contract starting PG"
"The thing that was special about the Sixers was that they drafted two injured players and got to extend their tank. Had Embiid been healthy off the bat, I highly doubt they‚Äôd have Ben Simmons. Replace Ben with an average starter and you probably don‚Äôt have a championship caliber team anymore.     For example, the Pelicans would love to tank again but can‚Äôt cause Zion is so good and wins them games by himself almost.     The Thunder are different because they have more assets than they could use. Everyone‚Äôs expecting them to try to draft well for a couple years and then cash in on picks to try to build a contender."
"Oh word, I forgot that makes Ben Simmons not a liability."
It‚Äôs debatable on if Ben Simmons is a good playmaker?
Curious how this sub claims Jrue Holiday is better than Ben Simmons and at the same time says AD had zero help on the Pelicans and Embiid had a better supporting cast by far
"John Wooden used to say, ""Don't let what you can't do interfere with what you can do."" Ben Simmons is an extremely talented young player with a very unique skill set. As we're witnessing this season, a team can be very successful building around him if you can find the right pieces. As fans, we tend to focus more on his obvious weaknesses than his considerable strengths.   That said, he's no freaking Magic Johnson."
Ben Simmons has never lost to the Knicks
"Maybe I am jinxing us here, but I don't see how the Knicks have any shot at all to beat the 76ers. The talent gap is just way too large there. Also the Knicks have literally never had even one win against Ben Simmons. It's just a horrible matchup for them in general."
"Most individual defensive stats I see tend to favor rim protection (guys like Gobert, Turner) and perimeter defenders who take a diverse group of assignments (1-5 defenders like OG Anunoby and Ben Simmons). They don‚Äôt heavily emphasize stuff like guarding the best player because it‚Äôs possible that it doesn‚Äôt correlate to high impact defense as much as the other 2 things and also I believe schemes like double teams may muddy the waters a bit."
Ben Simmons does a lot of things great: (defense / transition play/ little things/ playmaking arguably/ rebounding) does a lot of things well: (would put playmaking here but debatable/ finishing (also arguable))  does a lot of things ok: (finishing/ post play/ handle/ breaking down defenders) And there are a lot of things that he isn‚Äôt great: (shooting/ shot creation/ lack of aggression sometimes/ finishing through contact/ FT shooting/ and drawing fouls which he‚Äôs improved on)  There are probs things I got wrong or are debatable whatever tier they are and things I‚Äôm probs missing but the point is you could do this exercise with every player and find things for each category. With the obsession in today‚Äôs nba of shooting and the modern guard becoming a scoring threat unlike before where more emphasis was put on playmaking and facilitator roles (see nash era) Simmons declaration as well as Brett Brown‚Äôs decision to emphatically state how he is a PG and peoples view of what a PG is today has led to these polarizing views of him as a player. That and his fit with embiid not being as seamless as other fits have led to this narrative. Let‚Äôs just focus on what everyone does well and we can all fairly critique players areas of improvement
Ben Simmons career regular season PPG: 16.0  Ben Simmons career playoff PPG: 15.0  You're upset over literally 1.0 points.
"Playoff Rondo is a different beast, i love how him and Lebron can just turn it up when it matters. Obviously Ben Simmons can stay this way but that's no where near reaching his potential."
Bullshit have you heard anyone unironically say Ben Simmons is better than Magic Johnson you're just making shit up.
"Yeah but even Rondo at his worst is better than Ben.  Rondo rookie year, 6/29 from three. Ben Simmons career total from 3, 5/34."
Yes Magic was so bad at defense that he led the league in steals twice and had 45.2 DWS never stepping below 2.5 until his last year in the league but yeah his defense was terrible. LOL Isiah had 39.5 DWS. The 9X All-Defensive Dennis Johnson had 42.7 DWS for his career. Come back with a different narrative. Ben Simmons is a fantastic defender on the wing and in the post but let‚Äôs not act like Magic wasn‚Äôt doing the same thing?
Perhaps Ben Simmons is only really stubborn
Ben Simmons is also a fantastic defender while Magic's defense is regarded as a weakness.  The two are completely different players in every way imaginable outside of being tall.
"&gt; Ben might not even be top 15 on some peoples list.  Most people I would say. PG3, Gobert, Booker, CP3, Lillard, Tatum. I would take all of them over Simmons so I don't think he is a top 15 player right now."
Ok I‚Äôm sorry but how can Ben Simmons have such a complex about shooting threes when there‚Äôs a dude 8 inches taller than him who can do this shit? Just shoot it Ben.
And you can also find people calling ben simmons a bust.   There are stupid people on reddit. Who knew.
"Ben Simmons is almost a complete non-entity on offense save for point blank FG attempts. He can't shoot threes and he's a below average free throw shooter. Unless you're peak Dennis Rodman, you have to be good at more than one way of scoring the basketball."
Magic was also way fucking better than Ben Simmons.
Ben simmons is the kind of player I‚Äôd love love love to see a front office fully commit to building around as their central star. It‚Äôs definitely possible. The fact is he‚Äôs just too good at what he‚Äôs good at to not be good in the nba.
"Stop running the offense with Ben. It's a problem and has been for years. He will go into the Dunkers spot, they'll try to run some pick and rolls with Curry and Embiid or they'll clear out for Embiid isolations. Embiid has become an elite scorer this season so it's not as big of a deal but watching the 76ers late game offense is a mess and a large part of that is that Simmons stops running it.   You dont have to believe me. Come playoff time we shall see if it's corrected"
"How much better of a shooter Magic Johnson was is irrelevant. Literally everybody is a better shooter than Ben Simmons and that's not what made Magic Johnson good. What matters is that Johnson was ten times the offensive player Simmons is.   Simmons' limitations are exacerbated by the fact that he plays in the modern NBA as opposed to the 80s or 90s and because his team lacks any other high level creators or perimeter threats. His complete and utter inability to shoot greatly limits what he can do in the half court, both as a scorer and a playmaker. The Sixers have no one to pick up that slack. There's a reason their half court offence is so mediocre."
"He also trucked Ben Simmons who is 6'11""."
"Yup. I always say this on here but Magic != Ben Simmons  Magic, once he started shooting more, shoot 38% from 3 on 3.5 attempts in his 2nd to last full season before the AIDS thing. He adapted well unlike Ben, and is a WAAAAY better passer and finisher than Ben too"
"Yes shooting is a talent. There‚Äôs still no reason why Ben Simmons can‚Äôt atleast develop an under average midrange jumper/step back, and atleast shoot open threes.   His shot doesn‚Äôt look broken, it actually looks okay based on mechanics. Even the difference of Draymond vs Ben is huge for offenses in terms of shooting"
I dunno how Ben Simmons gets every person who comes through the Sixers to believe this
"Ben simmons was a rookie.. just like blake Griffin was when he won. A redshirt rookie, but that doesn't matter in the NBA. A rookie is a rookie."
*Ben Simmons slander*
Ben simmons   Joel embiid  2023 first round pick
Ofc he was tired. He had to carry the team because no one else showed up. He was constantly triple and double teamed on offense and had to carry the defensive load because Ben Simmons was injured. How does that make him a choker?
Lol the chances of that are lower than Ben Simmons hitting 5 threes a season
Ben Simmons can't shoot and as a result is a liability in the playoffs in a half court offense  Tobias has been awful in the playoffs   Embiid is good but building a contender around a center may be a thing of the past  Still a top 3 team in the east but def flawed
"That's what's frustrating about it, he could score 25 a night easy uf he set out to do it but has a bit of the Ben Simmons in him. I'm not worried though, it's hus 4th year and his scoring has gone up big every season"
"That's a good point but I'm curious, how many non-bigs do actually see a significant drop off in team rebounding when they sit?  I'd assume Ben Simmons would be one, but he's an anomaly."
Ben Simmons should take note. It's better to be a bad 3point shooter for a while and get mocked but eventually the reps will pay off.
"Sixers receive: Dame Lillard  Blazers receive: Anthony Edwards, Ricky Rubio, Jarrett Culver, '23 MIN 1st, '23 PHI 1st, '28 PHI 1st  Timberwolves receive: Ben Simmons  Who says no?"
"People treated RJ's shot like it was Ben Simmons esque, my young prince is a sniper now"
"Who even regularly gets them? Jokic? I don‚Äôt think anyone else gets them often. Ben Simmons and Lebron every now and then, maybe Harden?"
he‚Äôs been shooting foul line fade aways and turnarounds the last few games... just wait till he unleashes his j in the playoffs üò≥  i want so badly to see a ben simmons 3 ball game winner just once in my life
Lamar Odom would be a better version of Ben Simmons if he played in today's NBA.
"If Ben Simmons can get a good jumpshot, and grow a mighty beard‚Ä¶ Lord have Mercy‚Ä¶"
"This is a really bad take. Luka isn't Ben Simmons, but he isn't Trae Young or Dame either. He can also go long stretches where his defense is legit good. Dame simply can't say that.   Be that as it may, even if you say Luka is putrid on defense, what does that make Dame? Putrid plus? Vomit-worthy? I mean there is zero debate that Dame is a whole level of worse on defense than Luka."
Ben Simmons is the 3rd best defender on the Sixers change my mind
My dad thinks Ben Simmons has a screw loose and that‚Äôs why he doesn‚Äôt improve his offensive game and I used to argue with him a lot about it but I‚Äôm starting to kinda lean on his side   Every time we watching the Sixers (we live in the Philly area) if Ben has like 3 shot attempts and the games almost over my pops always goes on the same rant ‚Äúthere‚Äôs something wrong with him upstairs‚Äù lol
Ben Simmons owns luka
And it produced Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons among other things contributing to the sixers current contention
"His family fled Sudan and received political asylum in the UK. He's a British citizen, and much like many other non-American NBA players only came to the US for basketball.  They still claim their home countries.   Embiid moved at 16 for bball. Luc Mbah a Moute. Andrew Wiggins. Ben Simmons.  Monteverde Academy in Florida is a major pipeline for international players."
Better numbers than Ben Simmons.
Ben Simmons in shambles
Ya'll treating Dwight like he's Ben Simmons lmao
Because KD is better than Lebron when it matters.  Embiid has not proven himself in the playoffs. This is the year to do so. The last time Simmons was in the playoffs he was God awful. Tobias Harris is playing better than he has in years and I'm a fan. This is why I've been stating since the beginning of this convo that in many ways a series between the Nets and 6ers plays by how well Tobi does. He will be the factor. Ben wont do shit and Embiid will play well in 3 of 5 games.
My argument that Ben Simmons hasn‚Äôt improved offensively isn‚Äôt just about stats. He still can‚Äôt shoot. He‚Äôs still only good finishing with his right. Other then that there aren‚Äôt really holes in his offensive game but those two holes are and have been huge. He‚Äôs a mismatch for and non strong guards in the post but he‚Äôs not an elite post scorer because he has no right and no range. And that‚Äôs how he‚Äôs always been. What‚Äôs so different now?
Can ben simmons not run a pick n roll properly still? He can see over everyone on the court seems weird he can't get this down
Except I‚Äôm not? I‚Äôm fully aware players have value that can‚Äôt be shown in a simple box score. That‚Äôs why Ben Simmons is such a good player despite his counting stats not being incredible. But that has nothing to do with Ben not improving offensively. Which he hasn‚Äôt. At least not markedly.
"for sure, but he also doesn't have to be the best player on this team for them to succeed (unlike giannis), he just has to not totally kill them.    if you're asking for ben simmons to be your #1 or #2 you're gonna have issues. which is why they might have issues, you're asking him to be the best half court passer in their offense and he's just not gonna be that. They need Embiid, Harris and Curry to figure out how to make it work in the half court."
"Only a clown would compare Ben Simmons to Michael Jordan, in any context."
Ben Simmons doesn't lose to the Knicks bro
Ben Simmons who can kind of shoot.
"Says who?  Ben isn‚Äôt even the best defender on his team,much less the league.  It will be a travesty if Simmons wins dpoy."
I was thinking Ben Simmons also
"Yes clear DPOY,if you‚Äôre implying Ben Simmons is even close to Rudy,you‚Äôre about as close to wrong as an opinion could be."
Hell no. If Ben Simmons does bad in the playoffs again then I will start to consider him a negative asset with his massive contract
Ben Simmons
You should just change your name to Ben Simmons hater. Us Sixers fans know you by now.
Is that how long it will take Ben Simmons to learn 3s
"Well he‚Äôs clearly not Lebron, but he is the first Ben Simmons.   Holding against him what the dumbass media said is just stupid."
Aren‚Äôt you the dude obsessed with Ben Simmons
&gt;Kinda Reminds Me of The 2018 Season   *Me every year of Ben Simmons career*
I use to take Ben Simmons for granted and grew frustrated with his lack of ability to shoot but after he missed those last couple of games I saw how important he is on the defensive side and controlling the Tempo.
"the most effective luka defenders this year have been schroder and gordon   simmons didn't really trouble him the 2nd game, 32 points from 20 shots overall, 3/5 for 8pts and 0to guarded by ben"
The warriors need that 4th star depending on how you feel about Draymond I think these should be their targets  1. Siakam (perfect fit) 2. Ben Simmons (perfect fit) 3. Sabonis (Perfect fit)
"lmao took a quick look and it's raptors fans hating on the 6ers in this thread, weird - might have to give the Cs a break and fuck the raptors now.      Seriously tho, even Embiid said that he's trying to get to the playoffs healthy. The guys are just coasting the fuck out of games honestly, as far as they win 3 more and secure the first seed I am okay with this. Fresh Joel and hopefully playoff unlocked Tobias and Ben Simmons are going to be huge for the playoffs and they can warmup in the first round, and then second - we're getting the easy part of the bracket."
"I think it's more just a downstream effect Embiid taking up a bunch of F votes might affect the candidates at the F spots. But yeah it's not a big deal  I do think if we are letting Embiid be counted as an F we should really just do away with positional designations at this point for good. Outside of the true Cs everything else is interchangeable. Even guards like Kyle Lowry will spend playoff series guarding Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, technically they are playing a ""forward"" spot defensively those times. Doncic counts as a G, Ben Simmons counts as a G but LeBron has to count as an F, it's all just arbitrary as hell."
"I don‚Äôt know about that, I don‚Äôt think most lottery talents in the past 5-10 years have done much in their first year unless they‚Äôre drafted to be a franchise player. Jaylen Brown averaged 6.6 points as a rookie, Fox averaged 11 on bad effeciency his first year, Sabonis averaged 6. I can‚Äôt think of any lottery pick that had an immediate impact the last 5 years other than Trae (who they built the system specifically for, Luka (same thing), and like Ben Simmons who is a top player in the league. Taking projects in the lottery is very acceptable, if you think their potential is out of this world."
"Compared to similar lists that have been posted to r/NBA, this one is not bad at all. The criteria is interesting and it clearly takes work and dedication to do something so indepth, so kudos! Personally, I have a few main points of disagreement:  1) I feel like Anthony Davis is way too high. 52nd best player of all time? C'mon. He's an incredible player that can certainly get to that level, but putting him above Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, Tracy McGrady, Carmelo Anthony, Vince Carter, Dominique Wilkins, and almost 50 spots up on current players like Joel Embiid, Klay Thompson, and Nikola Jokic is bonkers.   2) Carmelo is *way* too low. 10th (about to be 9th) all time scorer, 10 all star appearances, a scoring title, 12 playoff appearances, and 6 all nba selections -- that is an insane career. Putting players such as Dwight Howard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, and Tracy McGrady above him makes no sense -- at least not statistically.   3) Why isn't Luka on the players too young right now? You have Devin Booker (age 24), Ben Simmons (age 24), and Jayson Tatum (age 23) on that list -- how is Luka's career someone more definable at 22? Simmons and Tatum have 2 and 3 playoff appearances respectively, Luka has 1. Could Luka be a top 10 player of all time in 10 years? Absolutely! But if you're looking at longevity and accolades, why is he above Kyle Lowry, Bradley Beal, and Demar Derozen?  Anyway -- cool list! I had a good time looking over it."
"LeBron  Kawhi  Giannis  Curry  KD  Harden  AD  Luka  PG13  Dame  Jokic  Tatum  Embiid  Butler  Beal  Westbrook  DBook  CP3  KAT  Bam  Mitchell  Murray  Simmons  Kyrie  Zion  Trae Young  Middleton  Brown  Jrue  Fox  Randle  Shai  LaVine  Vucevic  Demar  That‚Äôs 35 guys with a solid step on him.  Then you got guys like Siakam, Tobias Harris, Wood, Brogdon, etc. we‚Äôre depending on who you ask they may also be higher.  He ain‚Äôt top 30, and he is not on Ben Simmons level."
"This is exactly what I mean with Sabonis. Probably the most polarizing player in the league. Some people barely even know his name, let alone that he‚Äôs the franchise player for the small market Pacers. And other people think he‚Äôs a top 30 player. Then you have the others that think because he cannot take the Pacers to the playoffs, that he isn‚Äôt even in the top 50, shouldn‚Äôt have been an all star and puts up allll the empty stats. At least Ben Simmons gets his respect despite people shitting on his lack of shooting on the constant basis."
"Pippen was still a top 10 offensive player for his whole prime, probably top 5 for a few years. Ben Simmons is never going to sniff that, on top of that unless he lucks into a dynasty that wins more titles than the warriors he won‚Äôt be in any type of convo with pippen."
Lmao Pippen is a hall of famer and made multiple all nba first teams. Ben Simmons ceiling is All Nba Third team and is close to his prime at 25 years old. Comparing Simmons to Scottie Pippen is disrespectful AF. He will most likely be like Rondo who is a good 2nd or 3rd option but horrible first option and one you can‚Äôt go far with
More like instead of ben simmons
Ben Simmons. Why have I not seen anyone else say this lol pretty clear imo
"Add Bucks fans to frustrated. We're not really annoyed that Khris didn't make it, but more of the fact that Ben Simmons did."
"No offense to Philly fans, Joel Embiid is my pick for MVP, and y'all are having an incredible season...     # ... BUT HOW DID BEN SIMMONS MAKE IT..."
"&gt;Ben Simmons who averages 15.7 ppg  Also elite defense and playmaking, plus contributing to actual winning basketball"
Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons had more free throws than our entire team and we still won that first game... I know everybody is a homer for their team and I don't even particularly dislike you guys or your players but damn can't you at least recognize the disparity.
"&gt;Absolutely. It's even more than missing a call though. I don't know that Ben meant it to be that way, but that was a pretty dangerous foul. The refs are there, in part, to protect the players. That's just got to be super frustrating to almost be seriously injured and feel like you're playing street ball.  I didn't think it was anything more than a common foul. Simmons went for the ball and got arm. No bad intentions, just a sketchy outcome."
"Trae Young leads Ben Simmons in PPG (by 11 ppg), APG, same TS%, PER, win shares, offensive win shares, BPM, OBPM, and VORP.   He‚Äôs top ten in PPG and assists.   Using your logic, shouldn‚Äôt Trae be in over Ben ? The team success shouldn‚Äôt trump everything else right ?"
"Can we have only the all stars compete in the dunk/3 pt contest this year? Makes sense for Covid reasons too. We could have Lavine, Zion, Donavon, Brown, Gianni's, etc for the dunk contest and Dame, Steph, Harden, Luka, (and Ben Simmons for good measure) in the 3 pt shoot out."
"It's just pointless. How was he playing in those 4 games before? How about his 5th game before tonight? 4 games is a meaningless sample size.  Is Ben Simmons a bust because of his scoring limitations, especially in his 1st season?"
Ben Simmons 100%. Idk why I‚Äôm not seeing anyone else say this...
"He‚Äôs one of two players in the top twenty of both ball dominance and defensive impact, the other is Ben Simmons"
Ben Simmons is 2-3x better than him this season tho
Ben Simmons
"Makes no sense how Ben Simmons gets into the all star game but Trae Young gets snubbed on his home turf, absolutely ridiculous"
DPOY Ben Simmons!  When you hack and don't get called do they give you a block?
"Ben Simmons, am I right?"
At least we got Ben Simmons‚Äô sick defense and mad fundamentals that the ASG is known for. Incoming 8/18/8 stat line.
"No. I read a comment that happened to remind me of a bunch of arguments I had with people regarding Ben Simmons‚Äô all star candidacy. There was a lot, you just happened to be the one comment I saved (because of your pathetic arrogance), so I went back and made a simple little comment to remind you of how wrong u were (took me all of 3 seconds). You making a big deal out of it is showing you as the loser. Can you really not see that or do you know you‚Äôre wrong and now you‚Äôre just too childish to admit you‚Äôre wrong? I‚Äôd say the latter"
Ben Simmon &gt; Ben Simmons.   And it‚Äôs not close
Idk about Ben simmon but Ben Simmons definitely has an argument
"24 year old 3 time all star , All NBA , DPOy Ben Simmons"
&gt; Ben Simmons  &gt; rocket    Confirmed
Get fucked Ben Simmons
Ben ‚ÄúBradley ‚ÄòRocket‚Äô Cooper‚Äù Simmons
"I am referring to you saying Norm was selling it. Ben Simmons is 6'11 240 lbs human being and full on hit his wrist/forearm while in mid air. What do you expect Norm to do to counteract that force while in **mid air**.  Is it a flagrant foul? Maybe, maybe not. I wouldn't have called it a flagrant 1 but if it was I wouldn't care either."
"It‚Äôs honestly absolute bullshit that Sabonis did not make the All-Star Team.  He‚Äôs averaging 21 points, 11 rebounds, and 5.7 assist in the modern day NBA and he can essentially go toe-to-toe with any big man in this league......and he‚Äôs only 24 years old. He has the Pacers sitting 4th in a competitive Eastern Conference. Ben Simmons making the All-Star team over Sabonis is an absolute joke.  Scary thing is, Sabonis hasn‚Äôt even reached his ceiling yet."
Dude Ben is a dry fart in church. Last time i checked Simmons was never a All Star Starter.
Ben Simmons definetly ate his boogers
Ben Simmons pre season 3
Ben Simmons
Now imagine a 6'9 Ben Simmons slapping your arm while running at full speed and jumping...
Personally I would take Trae over Ben Simmons but I‚Äôm not really mad at the picks this year.  I feel bad for Devin Booker
Norman‚Äôs forearm should be more mindful of Ben Simmons hands next time
Here's some mental gymnastics for you:  Ben Simmons is a better basketball player than Trae Young
"The 76ers are not within 2 games of the Hawks. And Ben Simmons, while not putting up numbers, is doing relevant things there.  In the West, you can have that discussion between guys like CP3 or Conley vs. Zion (or SGA or Fox)"
The Sixers not winning in the playoffs proves that Ben Simmons isn't a *checks notes* All-Star reserve? What?
Ben Simmons is like a fake player you create in a video game that has 99 on every stat and a zero in shooting.  Obviously still a top player even if his flaw is very obvious
"""Ben simmons gets away with a clear flagrant foul"""
Just a reminder that last game Ben Simmons shot free throws for elbowing a defender in the face
"You're upset that Ben Simmons, the best defensive guard in the entire NBA, on the best team in the East, got voted in by coaches ahead of your team's star, the worst defensive player in the entire NBA?"
"Yoooooo fuck bitchass Ben Simmons, that‚Äôs one of the dirtiest most reckless plays I‚Äôve seen all season. Fuck him"
Fuck Ben Simmons.  Wheres the foul
You have 8 that's plenty. Last time we had 8 Ben Simmons was still a rookie
Vuc is not who I‚Äôd replace here. Ben Simmons has no business being on this list
Ben Simmons üò§üò§üò§
"[Woj]: The East is lasering in on James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic for the all star reserves."
"Holy shit those have to be the worst stats I've ever seen in my life lmfao.  The first one has Lamelo Ball above Kawhi leonard and Kyle Kuzma above Ben Simmons.  The other one has CJ Mccollum at 11, which is laughably stupid, and Devonte Graham at 9."
"I think I heard this on a podcast but a 3 point contest with bad and/or weird shooters. Ben Simmons, Markelle Fultz, Lonzo/LaMelo, anyone else?"
Ben Simmons. Already made 3 all star games in his first 4 years and never missed the playoffs.
"Three seasons after leaving the Lakers? You guys wanted Randle shot out of a cannon last season. Kobe took four years to really take off. Most prospects take time. Not every prospect is a Zion, Lebron, Ben Simmons type."
So happy Zach been balling tf out. Also Ben Simmons? I thought he was trash according to everyone here
The list is really more like  1. Rudy ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  2) Myles Turner/ Ben Simmons ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  Everyone else
"Very surprised Ben Simmons made it. Hes playing like a Defensive POTY but his offence has been so passive. If anything Harris probably deserved it more.  I can imagine people will be saying Booker got snubbed but honestly its the coaches pick and they would have always picked CP3. He also has not played better than Steph, Dame, luka, Donovan so it was a tough pick"
Simmons play like PG‚Äôs in my career. Easy to rack up assist when every time you drive the ball you kick it out. If Ben kicks the ball out 50 times a game I would hope he would average 9
"Although the criteria is so arbitrary. Sometimes you reward winning (Ben Simmons, middleton in the past, that hawks squad etc) and other times you reward individual play (brown and tatum), which is it?"
Ben Simmons has now been an All Star in 3 of his first 4 seasons (deserved it in his rookie year too tbh). Just the beginning of a legendary career
"Ben Simmons, Vucevic, Tatum, CP3, Zion."
Trae over Ben Simmons   Sabonis over Lavine
Jaylen Brown and Ben Simmons over Trae is actually ridiculous
Ben Simmons over sabonis is a tragedy
"I didn‚Äôt say Ben Simmons isn‚Äôt a good player, but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a better player than Trae young."
Ben simmons is an elite defender while trae is not
"This might be a scorching hot lava take, but l would kinda take Trae over Ben Simmons. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"[Charania] Sources: The East are tantalised by James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic. And the West are enamoured with Chris Paul, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis"
Khris is averaging 20/6/6 on 50/40/90. Ben simmons shouldn't be an all star lol
"West: Chris Paul, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis   East: James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic  Just a feeling I have"
"It's important to note that the coaches choose this. That's why I think Ben Simmons and CP3 are making it, because I think coaches value them. Anyway, here are my predictions:  **East**:  Harden, Brown, Randle, Sabonis, LaVine, Simmons, Tatum  **West**:  Lillard, George, Mitchell, Gobert, Paul, Davis, Booker.  Though I would not be surprised if Conley makes it due to coaches respect, or Williamson as an injury replacement for Davis"
"When did I ever say giannis was bad? Giannis has had a better supporting cast, shooters. Embiid would do well with a wing like khris middleton who can shoot instead of ben simmons."
"maybe i should say best finishing point guard at normal height, because luka might also be a better finisher than fox.  but yeah u right. i only put average point guard height players on because their actual skill and touch around the rim affects their finishing more than their size.   what if someone made a player with trey burke's height but ben simmons' finishing. how would that work? that's just too confusing."
"Those stats are skewed towards rim protection because it's inherently more valuable than perimeter defense like what Ben offers. It's why Embiid is by far the more valuable defender, despite Simmons showing more consistent 'flash'."
"Alright then. Your comparison means ben simmons are the next Magic, better? My point is there‚Äôs no base for a comparison, since they‚Äôre not even close to eachother in any way"
The all Kendall Jenner starting 5:  PG Jordan Clarkson  SG Devin Booker  SF Ben Simmons  PF Kyle Kuzma  C Blake Griffin
How does it work if I pick Ben Simmons for defense but Trey Burke for size
jumper: Steph  Defense: Ben Simmons Playmaking chris paul  0 on everything else
Finishing: Malcolm Brogdan  Jumper: Steph  Defense: Lonzo  Playmaking: Kendrick Nunn  Size and Athleticism: Ben Simmons
"Brogdon - Steph - Trae - CP3 - Ben Simmons  With Ben Simmons athleticism and size ain‚Äôt no way in hell you‚Äôre a liabiility on defense, even if you ain‚Äôt a positive."
Imagine the defense. He and Ben Simmons would be hell to play against.
Are you ignoring the existence of Ben Simmons and Jamal Murray?
Nah he's ben simmons by high school he meant his nba career lmao
those impact stars are very skewed towards rim protection when Ben Simmons offers a very different style of defense
"&gt; It also helped that Houston valued all those picks over Ben Simmons,  No, Houston's owner wanted to spite Morey."
"Ben Simmons has been **the** best defender in the league, imo."
"They need a steady pass first PG who can defend.  Like I think you swap Kemba for Ben Simmons and the Celtics go all the way.  Kemba is just not a great fit with the Jays - they brought him in expecting Hayward to be on the team, which made a lot more sense.  With the emergence of both Tatum and Brown as elite scorers, Kemba's strengths are not nearly as valuable and his weaknesses are shining."
"Lebron, KD, Ben Simmons, those cards alone netted me a bunch.  Too many to count that I‚Äôve just sold and bought at this point.   [here‚Äôs my profile if you want to check it out ](https://www.nbatopshot.com/user/@MOVEDFROMCSGOLOTTO/moments)"
Unpopular opinion but Ben Simmons his game is just so old school it‚Äôs so cool to watch in a modern league and no I‚Äôm not like 50 just like his game
"They went from a 34 win team to a 48 win team with the major difference on the team being Cousins. Idk why you think they were better without him. Another example, Ben Simmons led the Sixers on like a 15 game streak without embiid during his rookie year, against very good teams too. Did this mean that the sixers were better without embiid?"
I can't believe I forgot Ben Simmons and Mikal Bridges for on ball.  They are probably better than Aaron Gordon.  Gordon would be like 7th.
"Because it‚Äôs not all about the stats. Ben Simmons is by far the better defender.  On off is so stupid. Zach Lavine is a super negative player based on it. Completely a team thing, not player"
Warriors fans: ‚ÄúMagic Johnson is a worse Ben Simmons
"Murray-SGA-Barrett is already a prolific big 3, and then you begin surrounding them with a roster filled with NBA players. They should make the finals honestly but I am wary of the Australian team, especially if they have Ben Simmons. Serbia and Greece have the best players on a non-American team and France/Argentina/Spain are always relevant international teams.    But still we have the most international NBA players now so we have a great crop of players to choose from and this time around we have some legit stars in Murray and SGA."
"I fucking love watching Ben Simmons play defense. I pretty much never care who wins any of the individual awards, and it‚Äôs not like my opinion matters cuz I‚Äôm using zero stats to back this up lol, but hypothetically speaking in a game 7 with a 1 point lead I‚Äôd rather have Ben Simmons as my defensive stopper than Gobert. He‚Äôs just so much more versatile.   No disrespect to Rudy, he‚Äôs a game-changing defensive presence too.  Also Embiid should be on this list over Lebron, he‚Äôs a monster."
Why is Ben Simmons over Embiid for DPOY? Elite rim protection is still the cornerstone for a defense.
"Hard to say.   Simmons is potentially the best single piece (although we can't say for sure until we see the draft selections) but Houston wasn't going to get the pieces to build around him.   Simmons + Wood + 3 mediocre picks wouldn't be enough for Houston to retool, especially since you're missing a lot of your own picks as well.  By taking all those picks from Brooklyn, you've given yourself the means to have a full rebuild. Rather than the half-ass rebuild around Ben that would have resulted in Ben just leaving AD style down the track."
"I mean they had a decent amount of luck as well, particularly with KD leaving the Warriors.  It also helped that Houston valued all those picks over Ben Simmons, who was the highest value asset on the table for Harden.  Although Brooklyn ‚Äúplanned‚Äù all this, luck played a HUGE role for them, and nobody really predicted them to be this well off now 5 years ago"
"they still wanted to call Ben Simmons the point guard so why would they take SGA, right? üôÑ  even if you just had bridges it'd probably be the best defense in the league and offensively he'd help so much for the bailout option. poor Zhaire man, he really jumped high lol"
A Ben Simmons that shoots like Dame Lillard
Simmons for cj? Lol. Maybe tobais but not Ben
He's Ben Simmons if Ben Simmons was even more passive
Same thing with Ben Simmons
"Ben Simmons would be perfect with Steph and klay. He‚Äôs a better version of current draymond just not as experienced yet. Can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt shoot. Loves to play make, can defend 1-5, and he‚Äôs bigger than dray and more athletic. I think that‚Äôs the perfect team for Ben if the sixers want to trade him."
"Average is a surprisingly high bar in the NBA. I feel like I can name 15 better passers than Steph. In no particular order (mostly going by team record this year), Mike Conley, Chris Paul, Ben Simmons, James Harden, Jokic/Lebron if they count, Trae Young, Doncic, Lillard, Morant, Westbrook, Rubio, Lamelo, Lowry, Vanvleet and Wall is 16. I‚Äôd probably put Derozan as well but idk if I‚Äôd call him a point guard."
"I‚Äôve seen him play and Ben Simmons is better. Gobert hasn‚Äôt played enough honesty. But I was replying to what you said about having an historic season.... he hasn‚Äôt had an historic season. Going by advanced stats alone, like you stated, he‚Äôs not even average"
"For that reason I prefer to think about it in tiers.  Tier 1 (No particular order): Dame, LeBron, Kawhi, Luka, Jokic, Steph, AD, Harden, KD, Embiid, Giannis, Beal.  Tier 2: CP3, PG, Kyrie, Klay (if healthy), Lavine, Randle, Tatum, J. Brown, Jimmy Butler, Trae, KAT, Donovan Mitchell, DBook.  Tier 3: Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, Bam Adebayo, Siakim, Ja Morant, Vucevic, CJ McCollum, Jamal Murray,.....etc. You get the picture.  Tier 4 is essentially good role players with tier 5 being good bench players and tier 6 being situational guys and backups."
Ben Simmons ROY
He‚Äôs at most 6. Ben Simmons is his daddy.
"https://www.sbnation.com/2019/5/9/18554193/ben-simmons-philadelphia-76ers-fast-speed-highlights  &gt;Simmons‚Äô success is thanks to several physical advantages ‚Äî size, strength, and preternatural vision, to name a few ‚Äî but his pure speed, when harnessed at the right time, is awesome enough to conceal every blemish. At this point in his career, it‚Äôs Simmons‚Äô most powerful ally, and a marvelous tool that allows him to do things very few in league history ever could.  &gt;According to private data provided to SB Nation by NBA Advanced Stats, Simmons‚Äô top recorded speed this year was 19.7 miles per hour, which translates to him racing the length of a court in roughly 3.25 seconds. For a bit of context, Kings‚Äô point guard De‚ÄôAaron Fox, who declared himself the fastest player in the league, recorded a top speed of 18.6 miles per hour just before the all-star weekend."
danny green is a near 40% 3 point shooter....  he was not passing to a ben simmons open  3
You think Rose is faster than Ben Simmons right now? Jesus christ man watch basketball before you embarrass yourself like this
[Ben Simmons when he puts up 11 points in ECF](https://youtu.be/_YvP5ze8eDs)
why is ben simmons on here?
"The Lakers, Philadelphia and New York are the standouts to me. Philadelphia have a lot of great defensive personnel; and the Lakers and Knicks are coached really well defensively. Gobert and Embiid are great at rim protection. Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, Thybulle, Caruso and Jrue Holiday are great on the perimeter. Anthony Davis, Bam Adebayo, Draymond Green and Giannis are great help defenders."
"Yeah. No one other than 76ers fans will watch a game for Ben Simmons at this point. I don't know many ""stars"" with a game as boring and predictable as his.    Can't believe he gets Magic and Lebron comparisons lol"
Have you considered Ben Simmons
Mitch Richmond shouldn‚Äôt be in the HOF either.  Your argument for Ben Wallace is other undeserving guys are in so why not him?  Isn‚Äôt that what Simmons and RyEn are talking about?
That's just not at all what happened man. Please watch film of that series. Not that it really matters because that was two years ago and Simmons is in a completely different system. The fact that you say he has not been used as a screener this season tells me you have not watched many Sixers games. Which is fine. But you'll just have to either wait or trust me that Ben this season is not a liability. Or you can just look at Embiid highlights this season and see where Ben's man is when Embiid is making these shots.   Teams simply cannot doubled off of Ben from the dunker's spot without either him or the shooters being open. Everyone doubles Embiid many times a game so it's not like they aren't trying anyway. But we have been able to get effective offense (for us anyway) out of those looks all season long.
"He wasn't relegated to being the fourth option. He was the fourth option because the first three were:  Joel Embiid  Jimmy Butler  Tobias Harris  I am obviously a huge Ben fan but I want all of those players taking shots before Ben unless it's in transition or there is a mismatch in the post.   I am not worried because I watch every Sixers game and have seen the difference between how he's used this season and last. Idk if it's Ben being more willing to do the little things or just Docs coaching and schemes but he has been incredibly useful on offense, while shooting less frequently than ever.   So if we lose to the Bucks or Nets or whatever I am almost certainly not gonna blame the guy that averages (at least not only him) 14-15ppg for averaging 10-12ppg. If he's turning the ball over or getting roasted on the other end, or not pushing the pace then that's one thing. That's what he does for this team. But him not being a jumpshooter doesn't matter to the current iteration of the Sixers. They know he can't and that's why it isn't important for him to score in our offense.   The example you used is really my point exactly. The Bucks depended on MVP Giannis to score 25+ a game. He is their superstar number one option. His deficiencies caused him to not score efficiently or at his normal numbers. That hurt the team. Simmons isn't our primary or secondary scorer, he's our primary facilitator. He needs to be able to do that and a lack of a jumper is not likely to hinder that ability since it hasn't all season. The regular season does matter I'm sorry it does. It's not the playoffs but it is important.   And I know you might want to say that his limitations will hurt Embiid, but trust me they won't. Doc knows how to use Ben to make Embiid's life easier and he's been doing so all year. The playoffs won't change the fact that you can't just leave Ben wide open in the dunker's spot or when he cuts to the rim.   So no, I'm not worried about that. I have concerns, but not that Ben won't be able to score enough for us to win, because that's not typically how we win anyway."
Celtics fan here. Ben Simmons can lock down the best scorer on any team.  Gobert modifies the way teams play him. But they just shoot more 3's because he won't come out and defend the line.  I think Ben is better. The problem is he has the 4th best defender on his team guarding the rim in Embiid. So it's tough to day who's more important just like when you vote for MVP.

Top 10 (This Season):  1. Nikola Jokiƒá - 11 2. Russell Westbrook - 9 3. Luka Donƒçiƒá - 5 4. Domantas Sabonis  - 5 5. Ben Simmons - 3 6. Giannis Antetokounmpo- 3 7. LeBron James - 2 8. Draymond Green - 2 9. Kevin Durant - 2 10. Jimmy Butler - 2 10. Julius Randle - 2 10. Malcolm Brogdon - 2
Ben Simmons didn't play in the playoffs last year.
there's plenty of players in the league as fast or faster than Ben Simmons.
"Neither of them are right, obviously there's no single strategy that's going to work. That being said:  - You HAVE to cheat off Ben Simmons as much as possible.  - YOU have to prove THarris can actually hit a consistent playoff 3.  - You have to double on the baseline ISO with a taller player e.g. Rui because Embiid will go to his fade which is a lower percentage shot a decent amount of the time vs the double, and struggles to pass out of the baseline effectively.   - You have to double when Embiid is in with their bench almost every time off everyone except Curry.   Its going to be almost impossible for WAS to win, the match up is terrible for them."
If we had Miami lebron on this team instead of current lebron we‚Äôd arguably be the best defensive team of all time.   I think ad is the current best defender in the league. Him or dray. Miami lebron is like Ben simmons plus. We could run Caruso/KCP/Bron/Ad/Gasol and there wouldn‚Äôt be a god damn thing anyone could do.   We‚Äôd also be able to counter big lineups as well as small lineups. If teams go small we could run schroder/Caruso/KCP/Bron/ad and be equally lethal defensively.
"For whatever reason, I've listened to Simmons' podcast for like 10 years. I remember his issue has always been that he didn't feel like the Jazz had that crunch time guy to win you games. Over ten years, I don't disagree with that necessarily. But in the past couple of weeks he has gone out and said he's voting Ben over Rudy for some contrived reason (no word on how his ballot actually came out yet). And he had a new writer on recently who said something about how he hates Gobert because he was emotional when he didn't make the all star game, and yeah, Bill ate that up and egged his guest on. It just doesn't make sense to me why he is such a tool about it. Considering finding a new pod to listen to while walking the dog."
To me Simmons is the best for this era of NBA. Because of all the switches going on you need defenders that can defend all position and I've never seen anyone defend 1-5 so well like Ben Simmons. For a guy that big and heavy to be as quick as a guard is just special.
Why would anyone ever remake their team around Ben Simmons
I'm still not sure if Rui or Russ should guard Tobias.  Last time Ben Simmons posted up Russ easily.
Some casual fans really believe that Ben Simmons would do a better job than Rudy Gobert at defending the rim
"PG: Luka Doncic SG: Jaylen Brown, SF:  Jayson Tatum, PF: Ben Simmons, C: Jokic  Not only do I have scoring, defense, length and multiple ball handlers mixed through out this line up, I have longevity.   Picking guys like Steph, Lebron, Kawhi and KD would be better.....for a couple years. All of them are in their 30s and have a lot of mileage. KD, Kawhi and Lebron are getting hurt more than they ever have recently which shows they are slowing down. My line up is tearing up the league for a decade+."
Ben Simmons.
Ben Simmons fans:  angry about r/nba disrespect  Westbrook fans:  &lt;insert mel gibson talking to bloody jesus meme&gt;
This sub would write in Ben Simmons for ROTY every year.
Have fun with your homegrown 7th seed stars. I‚Äôll take Ben Simmons who won‚Äôt shoot a single jumper
"Lakers would love a playoff matchup with the Sixers where they actually bust out their defensive scheme, so Ben ain't winning it. Gasol on Embiid, AD on Simmons so AD can double team Embiid in the paint and guard both at the same time.   Simmons is getting absolutely clamped and his 1on1 defense won't be enough to win in the first place"
"They're unproven because they haven't beaten a Top 4 seed in the playoffs yet. Beating first round fodder teams doesn't mean much.   Embiid hasn't scored efficiently against high seeds, except against the Celtics last year, who didn't have a center (because the Sixers stole their center in free agency). This isn't the biggest issue, as Embiid impacts the game so much just by being on the court and opens up things for his teammates. We saw this in the Toronto series, where even though he couldn't score efficiently, he still had huge +/- marks.  Now the Sixers are fine on defense. That's a good base to lay for their team, but they need to prove they can be a functioning playoff offense.  What is going to happen against the good teams is they will leave Ben Simmons wide open because he won't shoot, and then double up Embiid and force the ball out of his hands like Miami did in the most recent games. They're going to force the ball into other players hands to beat them. Harris has been terrible against both high seeds he's played against with the Sixers, so he's suspect No. 1 that he can be a functioning offensive player in the playoffs. If Harris can't play well, then that will allow teams to make Embiid's life hell in the playoffs leading to a quick exit for the series against the good teams."
Yeah if I‚Äôm Russell Westbrook I want to have to play against Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons on defense instead of Kyrie Irving and Blake Griffin
One Ben Simmons please! Would love to have him on the clips
Is nobody picking defenders? Lol  I think Ben Simmons just to play defence and 4 other offensive players is the ultimate. I would use him just to lock down the opposition's main scorer. I don't even want him shooting at all. No pressure on him whatsoever to score.
&gt; That's not even remotely an equivalent.  Point guard isn't the primary playmaking position while center is the primary defensive position.    Lmao then what is the primary playmaking position?   &gt; It's why teams can't have top 5 defenses without a great defensive big man but teams can have a top 5 offense with average point guards.  To add on it can also be a great defensive PF as well.  Both big positions are equally valuable for rim protecting.  Interior defense will always be more important than perimeter.  But in Bams case he can do both.  ... with that logic no perimeter defenders should be in the running for DPOY which is just bad logic. Bam has been a great defender this season but I believe Ben has been just as good if not better than him. The Sixers have the second best Def rating and Simmons is a huge reason why.
"There‚Äôs usually only a guy or 2 in every draft like that anyway. People overreact. Last year it was Zion and Ja. Year before that Luka and Trae Young. Year before that it‚Äôs basically just Tatum. Year before that is Ben Simmons. Year before that it‚Äôs just KAT. Year before that is Embiid. Year before that, 2013, was pretty bad in the lottery anyway so I‚Äôm going to stop there lmao."
Bam is a better defender than Ben Simmons by virtue of playing a more valuable defensive position.
"I played basketball with a guy who played with Ben Simmons in juniors, and Ben Simmons is 3 degrees of seperation from Michael Jordan so by my calculations I am 5 degrees of seperation from MJ LOL"
"The process was over by the first Ben Simmons season.  Unless you ask The Process, who would tell you every season is a process"
"This is actually a much better response than I was expecting lol.   So this sub's hate boner for this random NBA player is because he ""loves to talk?"" (We talking about the same Ben Simmons here?), hasn't reached his potential yet, and nobody likes Sixers fans?   I gotta be honest...that's a better reason than most give. At least you're not acting like he doesn't get an enormous amount of hate like most people do. Like there aren't ten Ben Simmons hate posts on here everydayüòÇ"
Ben Simmons is going to ruin the 6ers playoff chances again lol. It‚Äôs insane that people don‚Äôt see this. Only way they come out of the East is if Embiid goes God mode or somehow Tobias takes the next leap.
Draymond has basically become a worse version of Ben Simmons on offense. It's sad to see cuz at least in the past Dray would shoot the 3 and not care if he missed. Last night he just did not want any part of shooting the ball. He's still an elite defensive player tho
If you thought Drummond was impressive you should see the way clutch time ben Simmons absolutely locks down JoJo.
"Never said he was one of the best playmakers, but that's what he does.   I don't follow the 76ers too closely, but Ben runs the point and plays defense.  My point is how does Simmons fit on a team where Jokic runs the offense.   Denver looks pretty good and if you were trading Jamal Murray, I'd go for a much better shootet."
"Campazzo did truck ben Simmons a few weeks back, not impossible for him I guess"
I remember back in 2016 game 7 when it actually Green who for a stretch kept Golden State in the game with his Scoring... I rather expected Varejao to score 25+ than Draymond turning up for 32 pts with 6 for 8 from 3.  Since then his shot really fell off to a point where you rather want to see Ben Simmons taking multiple 3s than him
"Whatever antics CP3 uses going up against the Lakers. Can already picture him mocking the Lakers complaining to the refs, messing with his former teammate Schroder, calling out untied shoelaces, etc. Whatever it is, it's going to be hilarious.          If the Warriors get the 8 seed and lose in 4 or 5 games to the Jazz, does that change the narrative on this season for Steph? I know if Harden was in that situation, he would get dragged. He'd probably get called out for shooting 10-23 in a game or something. I'm not sure NBA media is capable of criticizing Steph like that.          Does Ben Simmons manage 10 shots per game?         Which type of fouls will the refs stop calling? And which of the FT-heavy stars (Embiid, Trae, Giannis, Jimmy) is able to adjust? Embiid likely won't have to change much but I could see Trae having trouble.               Can Claxton take a step forward in this first series (can he consistently handle 25-30 minutes when needed, keep the chemistry going with Harden, etc)? He's a really really interesting player and it could be a huge boost for the Nets if he's able to establish himself as a viable option on both ends. The Celtics series is a unique opportunity for him if he's going against TT and a potentially hobbled Rob Williams. Similarly, does DAJ fall out of the playoff rotation and if so, how does he handle that?"
Philadelphia 76ers are 246-0 the last 3 years if Ben Simmons had the guts to shoot 3s. You heard it here first
Draymond‚Äôs screening and passing is what Ben Simmons needs to bring if he wants to play without a jumper.
"man I tried to be as clear as I could I'm not sure if you're taking the piss or calling me stupid or not understanding  Ben Simmons has the build and play style of a classic 4 (no shot, inside post/drive play) but with the ball handling of literally any pg of the old days (minus the shooting obviously)  He's a point guard but he's a completely different player than dame, curry, lilliard, Trae, etc. Literally has nothing in common with them except being the primary ball handler and offense initiator  Idk. This is something I'm very passionate about but I've been getting crunk as hell in anticipation of the Lakers blowing it tn so I don't think I can clarify it make myself any more coherent than my last comment. All I'm saying is that pg-sg-sf-pf-c doesn't accurately represents many teams starting lineup and how they play together, so what's the point? Why does 1=pg and 2=sg? On HOU with Westbrook and Harden who was the 1 and who was the 2? Or with CP? Or Ben Simmons and Fultz and whoever their nominal SG was (Reddick?)? If BS is the pg and Reddick id the SG what is Fultz?   We can ultimately shove these players in to their classic roles but realistically what's the difference between PG and kawhi? They are both ball handling primarily iso wings... SF and SG traditionally but when theyre on the floor together what objectively makes one the SG and the other the SF? It just seems archaic and not really accurate to the modern NBA. Idk"
"Didn't Ben Simmons drop 40 on Gobert?  Edit: my mistake, it was 42"
Come on man üí©Ben Simmons? You‚Äôve lost credibility.
"I don't know why this is such a sticking point for people. Teams aren't just pg-sg-sf-pf-c anymore. LeBron and Kyrie were practically 2 pg's years ago, idk why people are *still* acting like whether harden is technically a pg or a shooting guard even matters. Nba really just needs to go to g-f-c or even just g-f (me too tbh ‚úåÔ∏èüòî‚úåÔ∏è), some teams have a fairly archetypical 1-5 lineup but more and more don't and it's pointless to argue dumb ass semantics like this.   Like seriously aside from size what is the difference between a pg and a sg? (Ignoring that Ben Simmons is literally 6'10"" and indisputably the pg of the 6ers) ...handling the ball? ok so Westbrook and Harden clearly don't fit that stereotype or HOU was playing 2 pg's but for some reason people act like that is impossible lmao.  Every position can play primary ball handler-- you're either a perimeter player, an inside player, or both. Wings guards and forwards/centers should just be how players are grouped imo. PG (edit: Paul George sorry) is a shooting guard or a small forward depending on [reasons]... But why??"
You mean ben simmons?
How does one Ben Simmons and Isaiah Joe sound for LaVine? I think he'd make us great.
Ben Simmons has never lost to the Knicks.
This sounds like a role player or Ben Simmons. I'm assuming he knows there is a fine balance.
"The ""Ben Simmons is a better or more important defender than Gobert"" take is on of the few checkpoints where I can just go ahead and throw away anything else the nephew making it has to say about basketball. Doubly so for a ""sportswriter."""
Giannis is not a good shooter and will hemorrhage points on the charity stripe. Ben Simmons sucks in the half court offense and Embiid will get doubled. PHI and MIL have plenty of weaknesses
...ben simmons?
"It's definitely a stat that needs context and &lt;gasp&gt; game-watching to provide that context. Look at some other names in the ""top"" 30 for players with highest TOV% and we see: Ben Simmons, Facundo Campazzo, Ricky Rubio, LaMelo Ball, Goran Dragic, Trae Young, Kyle Lowry, Ja Morant, LeBron James. What these guys all have in common is that they don't take many shots ***relative*** to how much ball handling they do. For sure a couple guys (Trae and LeBron especially) shoot and score a lot, but they do *even more* ball handling relative to their teammates."
Will never get over Ben Simmons not wanting to reach his full potential
"Are Giannis and Ben Simmons the same level of scorer, even though neither has a consistent shot? The answer of course is no, and thats a pretty extreme example, but the point is offense isnt all just shot ability, athleticism, and passing. Also, you are ignoring half of the court, where Allen has gotten better and better"
"Ben Simmons, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram"
bro y'all were brigading our subreddit in droves because of jared dudley talking some shit to ben simmons. plus it's a big fanbase and philly fans are widely known for being overly passionate/obnoxious as a whole.  most fans of any fanbase are chill but to use a single annoying troll/fan to call the whole fanbase insufferable is just dumb as hell
Ben Simmons.
"Lmaoo can‚Äôt wait until you guys have to rely on Ben Simmons to be a useful basketball player and he‚Äôs just not, and you lose in 4 to Brooklyn after shit talking us all year"
"Scott brooks has been easily one of the worst coaches in the league for YEARS. This man has bad teams with talent over and over and they ALL underachieve. I don‚Äôt get why people think coaches are doing well just because they win. Teams with a certain talent level have expectations based on that.  Aka the Houston rockets with Phil Jackson would still be pure trash or on the other hand a team like the nets with ME COACHING WOULD STILL BE GREAT.   Scott brooks takes teams with finals aspirations and makes them look stupid. Russel has deserved a hard nosed strong coach for a long long time. If he got to be on the Spurs with pop early he has the talent to be goat level. Instead now he‚Äôs just a super freak stat whore. He will go down in history because of his drive and athleticism being soooo far above the norm, but this man needed to learn to slow his role as a shooter and become a pure slasher. He could honestly learn stuff from how Ben simmons goes about offense in a way. He‚Äôs more aggressive but just don‚Äôt shoot anymore.   As I can get sidetracked let‚Äôs go back to the main point.... SCOTT BROOKS SUCKKSSSS"
"I remember when Ben Simmons hit the ground HARD and popped back up and was liek I'm good I'm good. You'd think these guys acting tough would do more for their image and their getting calls than flopping like this, even if it hurts"
"we win the title, ben simmons fmvp"
"I think Jaylen &gt; Ben is a fair take (although I dont agree with it, its certainly close)  &gt;And it isn't particularly close either  Now thats just underrating Simmons by a ridiculous amount  Let me guess, Tobias Harris is our 2nd best player?"
"76ers. Everyone's already well aware of the Ben simmons conundrum and whether the 76ers half court offense will be reliable enough against the true contenders.     But I honestly believe whoever comes out of the heat/bucks/nets bracket will stomp the 76ers. That team will be much more battle tested compared to the 76ers, who will likely cruise to the ECF without facing much real adversity. I expect this will trigger Ben simmons trade talks in the offseason because I believe he will be the root of the 76ers upcoming woes in the playoffs."
James Harden 4 point play in Game 7 over ~~Ben Simmons~~ Mike Scott
James Harden 4 point play in Game 7 over Ben Simmons.
He has a Ben Simmons jumpshot with a Steph Curry mentality.
He's like a Ben Simmons with better offense and worse defense.   Almost inversely proportional. Almost.
Westbrook playing like Ben Simmons today
Says the guy with the Ben Simmons username lol
Ben Simmons and Steph Curry
I feel like there‚Äôs no reason Ben Simmons shouldn‚Äôt average atleast a block a game
Because Dinwiddie isn't a max player.  Him signing the max coming off an injury isn't an option so the scenario isn't realistic.  Also Schroeder and Ben Simmons are point guards.
Ben Simmons undefeated against both of those teams
"Ben Simmons, easy"
"&gt;*There are  And this is just a very agreeable list.   Other main candidate for DPOY is Ben Simmons. But he just isn't as much of a presence on the entire team's defense.   And as for 6MOTY, legit the only options even **CLOSE!** Are Jordan Clarkson, and Joe Ingles.   Yes there are Jazz, but the Jazz are kinda leading the league."
Ben Simmons shooter sleeve
"Yea I agree, I'm just saying that in 2019-2020 the sixers went 3-1 against the Celtics and then Ben Simmons was injured and missed the series leading to the sixers being swept. If Ben Simmons is healthy I don't think the sixers get swept in that series, but we will never really know"
"The sunk cost of acquiring PG won't be a factor in this hypothetical scenario though. In 2019 they didn't look at it like ""would we rather have 7 picks, Gallo and SGA or PG"", they looked at it like ""even though we're giving up literally everything, we'll get PG and Kawhi."" If Kawhi says ""trade PG or I walk"" then they'll be looking at it like ""would we rather have Kawhi plus whatever we can get for PG, or just PG by himself?"" That's an easy decision. So even if all they can get is Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook or CJ McCollum or something, one of those guys paired with Kawhi is still better than just having PG by himself."
"I think losing a series to Kyrie in the playoffs would be more painful to Celtic fans than losing to Ben,Simmons and Rivers though.   That‚Äôs just my opinion though."
"[PG is on a pretty onerous contract,](https://i.imgur.com/Fn9P1CC.png) that's gonna lower his trade value, especially if he has another ""Wayoff P"" type performance in the playoffs this year. IMO the only reason the Clippers would trade PG this summer is if Kawhi tells them they have to before he'll re-sign. If he tells them ""trade PG for Ben Simmons or I walk"" then they'll do it, because Kawhi and Simmons is better than PG by himself."
It isn‚Äôt that bad... if Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons weren‚Äôt already on the team...
"here, if you were to Google ‚Äúsimmons embiid  fit‚Äù you‚Äôll find tons of articles responding to those takes.   [here‚Äôs a vice article ](https://www.vice.com/en/article/439jap/the-problem-with-ben-simmons-and-joel-embiid-in-one-play) just for good measure"
"Their roster isn‚Äôt good jimmy acts like Ben Simmons from 3 for some reason, and the only reason they made finals was cuz of Covid last year. If they had a legit number 1 then jimmy the 2nd option with bam they‚Äôd be top 3 in east"
Bruh Jimmy really dropped that Ben Simmons statline in an elimination game I'm dying.
"Also, whatever the ""asking for more"" was, it couldn't be more than turning down Ben Simmons when Rockets were acting out of pettiness"
"The thing is, adjust with WHAt assets? The heat got plenty of open shots this series, before this game the heat had 102 open 3s and made 32 of them. This is inflated by the great shooting of game 1 even, thet just didn‚Äôt bring it. Bam was dared to shoot and got the Ben Simmons treatment, I think he‚Äôll get out of this but we‚Äôll see. Jimmy just talked shit to not show up. And we got out rebounded cause 6‚Äô9 bam and old man dedmon weren‚Äôt enough. Bud improved but I don‚Äôt think it is an out-coach. GGs tho, hope y‚Äôall win it"
This trade was about job security having pleffler of picks even if they're this putrid buys them a couple seasons. The absolute worst they should have done for harden was Ben Simmons straight up
"He smacked, I think, Ben Simmons in the head a few years ago while they were getting thrashed by the 6ers."
"I do find it funny that no teams were ready to cough up a real package for Harden. Even sixers wouldn‚Äôt even put Maxey in the Ben Simmons package. No Murray, Brown, MPJ, Herro  Like it‚Äôs James Harden. I don‚Äôt understand what in the hell these teams were afraid of."
"He slapped Ben Simmons in the back of the head after a turnover during the 2018 playoffs. Heat culture is best described as ‚Äúfront running, and then trying to hurt someone once you feel any pressure‚Äù"
Doesn‚Äôt surprise me. Dude also [slapped Ben Simmons](https://youtu.be/mGpiSfQuSME) a couple years ago
Bam is Ben Simmons without the vision smh
gonna get traded for ben simmons
Imagine this sixers starting lineup:  Ben Simmons  Seth Curry  Jimmy Butler  Tobias Harris  Joel Embiid  Would be unbeatable
Giannis with the Ben Simmons statline
Jimmy Butler is Ben Simmons with good PR and worse defense.
No they aren‚Äôt lmao. No team with Ben Simmons as its only good ball handler and Tobias Harris as its second best half court offensive player is a legitimate contender.
Yeah he‚Äôs a moron for saying that honestly. I misunderstood my bad.  Ben Simmons might actually be the most under rated player on this sub. Irl everyone I know loves him but this sub acts like he‚Äôs some bum who isn‚Äôt a lethal offensive threat because he can‚Äôt make it rain from 3
Embiid is a better shooter than giannis but the bucks shoot better collectively. Ben Simmons will become a liability on offense. Giannis will at least attempt a three
Ben Simmons is up there
"Jesus Christ don‚Äôt get hurt jerking yourself off lmfao. Not everyone thinks about Trae young all the time. You‚Äôre facing a garbage Knicks team, keep all this up when Ben Simmons is clapping his cheeks in 4 games."
Not a superstar but Ben Simmons easily
"The only way to unsettle Luka is to harass him right in the defensive court. Pop did that in the last game and troubled our whole gameplan, it was about time someone explored this in the playoffs. Luka is Luka, so, unless you have Ben Simmons, he'll score out of you. What you need to do is limit his playmaking, which harassing him did. Rondo was stepping all over his passing lanes and had Luka resorting to contested passes or just driving.   Of course, THJ came back to Earth last night, and KP is an asshole, so we need to see how will this strategy works when our role players resume playing at an All-NBA level, which is the minimum considering how effective Kawhi was. If they double on Luka with Rondo and Batum, and put Kawhi to guard THJ, we will lose this series in 6."
I wonder how Tatum would fair playing like that with Ben Simmons and Matisse Thybulle plying defense
"you probably wouldn't believe me but I've been hoping we get a pg like zo or haliburton to replace kemba. I think they'd be the best type of pg to compliment the jays and we'd become better defensively at the same time. Ideally it'd be ben simmons but everyone knows that's not happening so I'll take a Zo to go please, thank you."
Trade for Ben Simmons ?
KP for Ben Simmons would be crazyyyyyy if both lose early. Won‚Äôt happen tho
"You just being humble, in the playoffs against a real time Simmons gonna be a liability. 76ers not gonna be able to keep up. Y'all big 3 can go on a 24-2 run in 3 mins lol. Bucks way more scary for now than sixers. 76ers not gonna be real contender till Ben gotta force defenders to defend him outside 6 feet"
"If he plays poorly in the series that matter, I‚Äôm very confident Ben Simmons will be avalaible. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs what Dallas would want to give up assets for (probably have to be some sort of 3 team trade) but it‚Äôs a possibility"
Ben Simmons. On the team subreddit too
Luka 'Ben Simmons' Doncic
"Man, I‚Äôm glad to hear you say this. I was just defending Ben Simmons the other day and complimenting your team. I hate to say this, but I feel like I‚Äôve been getting along with Philly fans lately?"
"I have some extra time before bed....wow a story about racism in Boston makes it the most racist city in America? At least in Boston we are confronting our racist past, unlike some other cities in America, like Philadelphia, that like to pretend they there is no racism in their city. It's not your dads Boston anymore my guy.  Try not to pour a bag of popcorn on someone tomorrow.  PS Ben Simmons is overrated"
Would have been a charge if that was Ben Simmons lol
"Ben ""The Peacemaker"" Simmons is Neville Chamberlain.    ""No shooting in our time"""
He wanted to trade him for Ben Simmons after his second year because he thought he saw some ‚ÄúAndrew Wiggins in him‚Äù
Ben Simmons would love to know. That dude is scarred tf up.
Kawhi and PG13 for Ben Simmons and Thybulle? Who says no
"Agreed. I think he's a better defender than Embiid given he's a better rebounder and rim protector. Capela anchors the team Defense, while Embiid plays with a DPOY candidate in Ben Simmons."
Yeah and against Ben Simmons who was just starting to play defense. He knows how to play in the playoffs and the Nets/Sixers games back then we‚Äôre B E E F Y
Ben Simmons is great at this. He has fantastic body control on defense for someone so tall.
"He ain't top 15. He's not better than Bron, giannis, harden, KD, Steph, Kawhi, Luka, AD, Jokic, Dame, Kyrie, cp3, Embiid, Gobert, Donovan, PG, or Ben Simmons."
i'd have serious misgivings about trading ben simmons for dame even if i was philly  I'd probably do it in the end but wow would your defense take a big hit
Pretty much   Not to hate on him cause I have nothing against but you gotta consider its a positive for the blazers but the other team just gets the worse deal cause you're taking him and his contract  For example would you trade someone like Ben Simmons for CJ yet alone jimmy butler?
I do too but he gets injured every 10 games in 2K as well... Perfect next to Ben Simmons
I put Ben Simmons to the Magic and then cheesed with Issacs at the 4 and Ben at the 5 in a 2k myleague  Safe to say I had the best defensive team of all time when both hit their primes
" They wont do it but I would trade Dame for Ben Simmons, 2 first round picks and start over...."
Ben Simmons was 16 the last time the Knicks made the playoffs.
The Knicks have never lost to Ben Simmons in the playoffs.
"Boston would have kicked the shit out of the sixers if simmons was there or not.  This is because Boston tends to have good defenses with big wings (tatum and brown) and guard defenders (smart), and solid tweeners that take advantage of Ben Simmons complete inability to score off the dribble.   Unlike the raptors year, there isn‚Äôt a Jimmy butler to run point.  And this bucks team is a lot better than the injured Celtics team from last year."
Ben Simmons for CJ McCollum straight up; do both teams get better? I think so.
"I thought Bill Simmons, Matt Damon, and Ben Affleck led Boston"
Uh  Dlo was the starting guard for that Nets team that was beefing with Ben Simmons and the crowds were always electric then lmao
You're right there is a big difference between the regular season and the playoffs.   For example: Ben Simmons is useful in the regular season
Ben Simmons has never lost to the Knicks
"If anyone tries this to win a series, the Sixers are gonna roast em.  They are just gonna post Simmons in the middle and let the shooters bomb. No help for the big, we saw how Rudy Gobert handled Ben 1v1 down the middle."
"Kawhi has been riding his defensive reputation for a long time now. He‚Äôs still incredible one on one but he routinely falls asleep off ball, makes poor defensive reads, and generally plays with pretty low effort on the defensive end these days.  Even in Toronto we would actually hide him a lot during the playoff run. He was guarding JJ Reddick down the stretch against the Sixers, when the other 4 guys were Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, and Joel Embiid.  I really don‚Äôt think he has it in him to be a stopper for an entire game"
He probably saw Ben Simmons in Kendall‚Äôs dms again
"If that‚Äôs how AD felt, he should‚Äôve felt that way universally. Not to mention Lebron publicly bitching for weeks about about the Hill dive which he‚Äôs done on multiple occasions.   It would hypocritical for Embiid to have that stance if say, Ben Simmons shoved someone in mid-air and he didn‚Äôt call it out. If Embiid dove into an opponents knees in a finals game and then spent 2 months bitching when someone did it to him, it‚Äôd be hypocritical.   You‚Äôre right they‚Äôre different plays, Lebrons shove actually caused an injury.  I feel like you‚Äôre just sticking your head in the sand to ignore all criticism of LeBron and AD."
Not Ben Simmons

"He and Ben Simmons should try shooting underhand, no way they could do any worse!"
"Tyler Herro - He had a good playoff run whilst being young, gets a lot of hype. Scorers naturally get more hype too. People were high on him but now kinda regret it seeing as how he slowed down a bit this year.  Jayson Tatum - Compared to Jaylen, he came out first, jaylen's kinda living in his shadow. BI plays for the pels, he'd probably get a lot more hype if he was somehow still on the Lakers. Jayson also has big games and people remember those more.  Ben Simmons - Generational talent that could be much better if he somehow learned to shoot better, there's nothing wrong with people saying he's good but at the same time he could be much better if he could shoot which has impacted their playoff run  Andre Drummond - AKA Big penguin. He plays on the Lakers, obviously backlash is going to be a little more overblown. But i mean he clogs the lane when both the stars play, he's meh when he comes to stopping the PnR the Suns run. He also has like 0 offence and bricks when its not a dunk or a layup under the bucket."
"So what you're saying is...   Tyler Herro is the next Michael Jordan.  Ben Simmons is garbage.  Jayson Tatum is the greatest of all time and he's only 19.  Drummond is Drummond.    In all seriousness, all I'm saying is some of these players get too much love while others get too much hate. Maybe it's justified and I'm just not really seeing why..."
Lakers stars def are not 100% and laboring through lingering injuries but cmon...  CP3 isn‚Äôt even functional right now. He went from an mvp candidate to bring guarded like Ben Simmons from 3 and scoring 6 points a game
Ben Simmons and Jamal Murray are probably the only two tradable young stars on contender teams that Portland would even look at.
Post game threads literally hurt my brain in the playoffs.   The all time one was when people called Dudley more valuable than Ben Simmons.
"If you morph ben simmons and tobias harris into one human being, that's kinda like lebron"
"Last year's Heat team would lose to the Bucks, Sixers and Nets this year and I'm not sure they'd be that close. Their big difference is losing Jae Crowder.  The previous year's best team lost their best player, the Sixers lost Ben Simmons, Kemba had knee issues. They were better than the Bucks but that was also aided by a major injury."
Are you quoting Ben Simmons? Lol
Bron with the Ben Simmons stat line so far.
"Defense is definitely sticky as fuck, but I can‚Äôt even tell you the offensive identity that the heat have rn it is all over the place.  Part of it is definitely the bucks defense but the other part of it is that moreso the heat just look lost as fuck.  I think the bucks are going to pose serious problems for both the nets and 6ers.  You can put Giannis on Ben, and jrue on tobi and neutralize both of them and then rotate out to the shooters on the Embiid double team.  It all is going to depend on how well jrue defends Simmons and Harris once the switches happen.  I have little doubt that he will do his job, but if their length and size is enough to cook him it will  be a long series."
"I was absolutely convinced there was no way the nets could trade for harden. To me, Ben Simmons was worth more than the entire trade package the nets offered. I underestimated the lengths Fertita would go to spite Morey"
Every one shooting like Ben Simmons at the 3 point line
Westbrook is shooting better than 103% True Shooting when guarded by Ben Simmons this playoff series.
"Yeah, I don't doubt Ben Simmons is great but the Bam slander makes you think the past 2 years dissappeared and replaced by the past week. r/nba for ya."
Embiid had a great postseason series. The rest of the team was garbage and Ben Simmons was hurt.
"Only exempted ones are Philly and the others that had 0 assets to trade, they tried but Tillman hates Morey. Fucking Ben Simmons was offered and the Heat really went ""I don't think he's worth losing Herro"" lmao"
People forget Ben Simmons didn‚Äôt even play in the bubble.
"What am I hating on? The fact that the 76ers achieved literally nothing? Y‚Äôall have Tobias Harris, Embiid and Ben Simmons. No reason why that roster shouldn‚Äôt have already won a chip lmao"
"Cross post this to /r/nbadiscussion   Westbrook actually tweaked his right ankle on the post up play.   Brooks is the worst with matchups and lineups. It‚Äôs no surprise he hasn‚Äôt adjusted or game-planned for Ben Simmons posting up his guards. I bet he‚Äôll finally try something game 3 or 4, but it will be too late"
I said ‚ÄúBen Simmons doesn‚Äôt produce enough‚Äù?  Or I said ‚ÄúMatisse thybulle needs to shoot to provide value in his current form‚Äù and ‚ÄúBen Simmons has flaws in his offensive game‚Äù  Big guy
Ben Simmons has unironically been much better in these playoffs than Bam.
He‚Äôs got the Ben Simmons syndrome
Meh it's not to run it all game. You need it when you get beasted by Ben Simmons over and over.
"As far as All-Star players go, Ben Simmons. Kind of seems like the same player as last year: 1st team All-Defense level defender, potent transition threat, and limited offensive game."
They guarding Bam like Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons
I guess we‚Äôll see how really good Ben Simmons and the sixers do this playoffs and you can come back and rub it in my face  I‚Äôm already imagining it
You were being condescending lol do I have to respond politely and earnestly to that?   Oh sorry I mean ‚Äúimagine you were being condescending‚Äù   The spurs have nothing to do with the sixers and Ben Simmons is not a player that most should be modeling their offensive game after
Yeah Ben Simmons is a good offensive player that‚Äôs universally agreed upon. Sorry for implying otherwise. He definitely has no gaping flaws in his game that he makes up for by being gigantic
Jrue holiday  Chris Paul  Kyle Lowry   Ben Simmons  Mike Conley  Even Steph curry is able to play solid defense while running around a zillion screens
Paul George trade for Ben Simmons who says no and why?
"It's definitely ben Simmons lol, can't wait for the nets to sweep the fraud sixers and for Joel embiid to go to Miami"
James Harden. Jazz fans were out here at the beginning of the season saying we wouldn't want Harden to come to the jazz because it would mess up our chemistry lmao  Ben Simmons bc he has had beef with both Rudy and Donovan.  Enes Kanter. We just didn't get along with him.
Ben Simmons but not always but still sometimes still love there tho
"This might be the worst take I've ever seen. 2003 NBA wasn't a talent gap, the game was nothing like it is now. Games rarely broke 100 points.   You're crazy if you think a 22 year old Lebron(same age as Luka) who dropped 30 straight points on the defending champ pistons wouldn't dominate in today's game.   This is the fastest the leagues been in decades and you're saying one of the most talented and physically gifted players ever wouldn't dominate?    Look at Ben Simmons and then throw in some steroids."
I didn't do the the math but it shouldn't be that much higher considering Ben Simmons got 5/177M with the 28% max right?
To run the bench fair. But when ‚Äúworse Ben Simmons‚Äù is giving you 5 blocks and 4 steals in 20 minutes you might want him in the game for longer
I would absolutely love Ben Simmons and worse Ben Simmons to run the bench unit
DPOY BEN SIMMONS YOUR TIME IS NEXT ROUND  IF YOU CAN MAKE IT
100% of Ben Simmons free throws this playoffs have been UNcontested. He has made 34% of those
? I just said Ben Simmons not Ben Simmons is trash or anything
"Giannis. If I‚Äôm dying, I don‚Äôt eat to have to look at Ben Simmons."
I completely agree. People out here acting like Ben Simmons has a learning disability. If he can‚Äôt shoot it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs not practicing as much. Simple as that. Stop making excuses for the man. He needs to learn how to shoot just like everyone without his athleticism and size does to stay in the league.
Ben Simmons
I‚Äôll take him over only Simmons of Ben he is a layup merchant
Meh the only person op listed that you trae is definitely better than is Ben Simmons  I would go   Lavine Young Brown  Simmons
"It‚Äôs because their star Ben Simmons is only good at one end and even at that he‚Äôs not the best. He has to campaign, brag. Have his fans build narratives but he‚Äôs gonna get cooked by any superstar with ease. It‚Äôs happened before and it‚Äôs gonna happen again. He‚Äôs not even gonna lock up trae and he‚Äôs not even top ten."
"""not being played off the floor"" is a response to people wilding in threads like this. Not the expectations I (or anyone sane) have for the player. Reading the reactions after a bad Giannis game you would think that he was the worst on the floor and most often than not he is the best on his team and sometimes the best overall (GM1).  People confuse bad games with losing games. It's possible to play great (like he did in GM1) yet still lose.   It is also possible to play badly (Game 2) yet still better than the rest of your team (which was playing an atrocious brand of basketball).  Watching Giannis playing under Bud is more and more irrelevant. Bud is basically playing the same kind of basketball that lead Hawks to be swept in 2016. I honestly want to see Giannis play within his position for once.  I.e. have some coach to bench Giannis every time he shoots more than 2 threes a game, especially those early shot clocks ones. Watch him play more off ball when he can't penetrate certain defenses, watch him play his strengths more and his weaknesses less (less Jumpshots, more rolling, more offensive rebounding)...  He is no Ben Simmons, he is way stronger, lengthier, more athletic, seeing him being stopped Ben Simmons style is more and more stupid. Play him to his strengths more and then we revisit the top 5 argument.  Giannis playing out of position is no top 5 material, that one is for sure."
"Ben Simmons. If he missed it seems like he'd just go live his life as usual. If Giannis missed, he'd probably feel sad about it and make his family and team run laps."
Ben Simmons doesn‚Äôt help the Rockets at all
"They could‚Äôve gotten Ben Simmons so yeah, they left a lot on the table."
Ive been saying since last year when Ben Simmons trade value was lowest and I said it again this December when CJ was shooting the lights out a CJ for Ben trade really helps both teams.
Yes but they could‚Äôve done so much better. Like with the nets they could‚Äôve gotten much more. Or if they weren‚Äôt so stubborn maybe they could‚Äôve gotten Ben Simmons
&gt;Looks like Ben Simmons out there.  [luckily the nets have prepared for this](https://i.imgur.com/1xpzq33.jpg)
Want Ben Simmons to practice and improve.  Everyone also wants giannis to improve.  It doesn't even look like Simmons is trying to get better
"Is a bunch of picks from current contenders more valuable than Ben Simmons, Mattise Thybulle, and presumably a few picks if we are to believe the report that their agents told them they were gone?"
hawks win off of a lou will buzzer beater after ben simmons ties the game with two clutch free throws
Ben Simmons
"Ben Simmons, Fultz.... Sixers need to hire a sports psych person to help diagnose these cats before draft"
"With Sixers current roster construction, no because of chemistry and fit. If Sixers decide to shake things up and move Ben Simmons then maybe depending on other players on the roster and Middleton‚Äôs role.   Middleton is a really, really good basketball player. However, if you look at NBA history, you need two top 10 players, one of those guys being in the top 5, or a bonafide top 3 player with two other guys sitting between 5 and 25 to actually win a ring."
Ben Simmons and Bulle have nothing to do with this. Again enjoy the late first round picks. Big day coming for the Thunder with the draft lottery.
Hawks Fans ü§ù Sixers Fans upon seeing the ref starting lineup tonight.   Can we see a Trae lob to Embiid for a poster dunk on Foster?   Ben Simmons drain a 3 with both of the Tony Brother‚Äôs hands in his face?   We‚Äôll never know because the clock will never run and everyone fouled out with 11 minutes to go in the first.
"ok, enjoy ben simmons and thybulle both standing open at the 3 line as you lose to the hawks lmao"
"Ben is a HISTORICALLY bad jump shooter, if you‚Äôre shooting 30% outside of 8 feet why the hell is it smart to attempt those shots in game?    You honestly think the opposing coach is telling his team to contest a Ben Simmons 15 footer?"
"Its crazy to say ""a more athletic Ben Simmons"" when talking about Giannis not scoring. Its a textbook version of this sub not understanding Ben's game by any means. Yes, if he could shoot he'd be better, but dude just put up 17/4/10 in a playoff game and they act like he didn't do anything at all"
And y‚Äôall want Ben Simmons doing the same thing ü•¥
"With all that's happened though, I don't think we would win a Championship and get past kawhi unless we had Tatum, in full hindsight, even if Fultz wasn't injured. He's a big scoring threat, but we'd probably rely hard on Embiid's inside game and Ben's playmaking too much for Fultz to be effective. Brett Brown did have a scheme where it was just not good for ball handlers other than Ben Simmons.  Plus if we got Lonzo, I don't know if we'd trade him since it's a toss up. Since he's a pretty good defender, I'm not sure we'd be picking people like Tisse in the draft."
Just a longer Ben Simmons
That's still ben simmons lol (most polarising)
Ben Simmons is an extreme though. You want the player to at least take a few jumpshots from time to time. You're not going to improve by not shooting at all. Ben Simmons simply refuses to shoot any shot that isn't a layup or a dunk
And honestly Lonzo turned out fine and would have fit well next to Ben Simmons in his current form. But fultz didn't look bad in a sixers uniform at first. Summer league Fultz had a ridiculous scoring ability and I have not seen a rookie have such a clean offensive game. KD made that hesi pull-up jimbo tweet for a reason
ben simmons would never.  maybe try a DHO with Forbes??? Nah.
I like how it‚Äôs the Sixers complaining about fouls when they shot 35 free throws and Embiids wet floppy ass flails on every fking drive and gets calls even when people back off and let him shoot. Capela can‚Äôt even sniff near that dude.   Trae got two calls on Ben for driving past him and Ben getting handsy then in the 4th quarter the Sixers basically are allowed to do whatever they want and the Hawks couldn‚Äôt buy a foul call even on intentional fouls by the Sixers.   If you wanna call out soft calls - call out that Bullshyt floppy boy Embiid gets because Trae wasn‚Äôt even going for fouls vs Simmons.
"With Ben Simmons I think it's more of a developmental thing than a ""Simmons could help his team right now by taking more jumpers"" thing. Everyone wants him to develop a jumper but not everyone realizes you need to get some in-game reps at some point to actually develop a functional one that defenders bother to defend.  Giannis clearly doesn't have much of an issue with willingness, he's taken plenty of in-game reps to try to develop that jumper. Problem is it just isn't working and he/the Bucks need to just cut their losses in that regard. Taking these jumpers against the Nets or any other playoff team with a pulse accomplishes nothing."
"i mean if he can shot better he would already do that.  the thing is some people are just capped at certain level. i think giannis is that person. regardless how much he practice he just doesn't have the touch to shoot a basketball.   that will always be his weakness, so a good coach should know how to utilize his strength and hide his weakness properly.  i mean at this point, people should accept that this ""shooting"" will not and never come for giannis and stop expecting him to have that.  this is like asking ben simmons ""just make a shot"", well i don't think he plan to miss in the first place"
A better way to phrase it is ‚ÄúGiannis is the rich man‚Äôs Ben Simmons‚Äù
Ben simmons
Nah Ben Simmons wishes he can finish around the rim like Giannis.
He‚Äôs just a glorified Ben Simmons
Part of reason is also he's not hitting free throws during that game too. He's afraid to drive in and get fouled. Confidence of shooting free throws is completely gone for that game. Looks like Ben Simmons out there.
"Yes. They could be elite if he played and acted as a more versatile Gobert.   But in his mind he is a wing, and wants to win by being a facilitator and primary ball handler, unfortunately he‚Äôs turnover prone, not a great ball handler, and a horrendous shooter.   And now he seemingly has turned into Ben Simmons from the FT, so he‚Äôs going to be more reluctant to search for contact in the paint."
Ben simmons has attempted about 40 for his career and is a point guard
"I was going to make a post about something similar.   The way the Nets are defending Giannis and the are exactly why Ben Simmons doesn‚Äôt ‚Äújust shoot to keep the defense honest‚Äù.   If Giannis turns into prime Steph Curry from behind the arc who cares you take that loss. God already intervening to let him hit shots like that, your hand in his face not gonna change that.   Otherwise dude is gonna keep clanking."
"""why won't ben simmons take more jumpers"""
If it isn't your strength don't do it. Ben Simmons is smart lol. Don't take jumpers if it isn't your game
Giannis is giving us what Ben Simmons won't. That's a true MVP.
&gt;More athletic version of Ben Simmons when it matters  Is that supposed to be a negative? Ben Simmons is a phenomenal player... Giannis is held back by an archaic scheme that asks him to be the primary ball handler in an iso heavy offense with minimal ball movement. Coach Bud is way more the problem than Giannis
Ben Simmons should check out Reddit then.
&gt; Tatum would just torch him with threes if he did that.  This is why Giannis will never win anything being the #1 option.  You can't have a non-shooter be the #1 option.  Ben Simmons is a crappy jumper away from being the same offensive threat as Giannis
"""And while we're on thr subject, Ben Simmons is clearly better than James Harden,"
"I don't know as I'd say he's a playoff choker he dominated that series against Miami.  Brooklyn is a much better team they're deeper and they have a bunch of big guys that they  can throw in there to set up a wall around him which is always been the strategy to use against him.  They make him an outside shooter, which is not his strong suit.  If Philadelphia advances and I'm not sure they will, they'll do the same thing to Ben Simmons.  This might be heresy but I think Brooklyn actually looks better without James Harden in there. The ball moves around better The other contributing teammates are part of the offense and it gives them a hell of a lot of confidence.  Harden, Like Westbrook here in DC for the Wizards have a tendency to dominate the ball... I don't think that makes you a good team.  But back to Giannis... Like Luka inDallas the offseason for them is going to be devoted to finding another dominant player to run beside him.  Chris Middleton and Holiday are fine players but they need another dominant scorer to match up just like Luka does in Dallas."
They should totally do it! They can 100% beat the Hawks with Ben Simmons as their best player...
"Good thing Embiid is our superstar then and not Ben ""Poor Man's Giannis"" Simmons"
I wouldn‚Äôt call Ben Simmons a great player. He‚Äôs a very good player though
For way too long I was wondering how we had a documented take from Ben Simmons from 11 years ago
"Ehh...Simmons is a better defender and a better passer. Giannis is a better scorer but as we've seen in the playoffs, he's not a good enough scorer to carry a team in the postseason. Ben doesn't need to carry the team like Giannis does and what Simmons is better than Giannis at, is better suited for the Sixers because they have better scorers than the Bucks."
"Ben Simmons couldn't stop Kawhi, no one can stop him"
Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons has entered the chat
"Oh like All-NBA Ben Simmons? or All-Defense Ben Simmons? Booker has played 6 seasons and has 2 all star appearances, Simmons has 3 in 4 seasons. Simmons finished 3rd for triple doubles in his rookie season and broke magic johnsons record or TDs as a rookie. Simmons also made all-nba 3rd team and all-defense 1st team last year, which booker hasn't accomplished yet but go off, I'm enjoying your crying over an opinion the majoirty of nba fans would hold"
You do realize Ben Simmons is a great player right
Ben Simmons
"Oh yeah sorry not comparing him to Harden, just saying Simmons is a player that drives me crazy to watch. But Giannis has a lot of the issues I knock Ben for is what I was getting at. Embiid is crazy skilled"
"And Ben Simmons is supposed to have had a jumpshot for what, 3yrs now?"
"How is that possible? fwiw I've deposited 90 dollars total ever into my account and yeah he's done well against Ben Simmons, but that alone doesn't make you one of the best scorers in the nba does it? but go and look again I'm sure you'll find at least one stat you can use to compare booker to the best scorers so you don't have to delve into making it personal or providing anecdotal bullshit like ""hes made ben simmons his bitch"" just look a bit harder this time and learn to control your emotions a little bit"
Booker made Ben Simmons his bitch over and over and over and over again. Just because you‚Äôre a 76er fan doesn‚Äôt mean you need to shove your head up your ass and pretend to ignorant   I hope you lost more money than you own last night. Absolute pathetic but hilarious from my point of view
Kinda irrelevant but to realize that a player is more athletic at the same time is taller than ben simmons is fucking nuts
"Yup it's so predictable lol just like Ben Simmons destroying the Sixers halfcourt offense in the playoffs every year but somehow people never learn.   KD, Kawhi, LeBron (unless he's washed, which he might be), and Curry are in a tier of their own.   And yeah Giannis is always massively overrated based on the regular season. The ""Nets have no answer for Giannis, Bucks in 5/6"" takes from before this series were so dumb lmao. The answer is just keep him out of the paint as much as possible, and foul him when he does get in the paint, as we've seen every year."
"Ben Simmons for Dennis, Schroeder, THT, Kuzma, KCP, Harrel and Dudley   Who says no?"
"""i think im going to have to foul him and hope the refs don't call it"" - ben simmons 2021"
Giannis won DPOY because of help defense he ain‚Äôt Ben Simmons   He don‚Äôt clamp up the best opposing player he ain‚Äôt got the skills for that
In his defense...he‚Äôs trying and he‚Äôs not afraid to let that shit fly...unlike Ben Simmons. He‚Äôll get better at it. The question is how much better and how soon?
"I love the 76ers, and I agree on your take. However, the 76ers are afraid of gambling Simmons‚Äô fouls by guarding a number 1 option early. They‚Äôre afraid of getting him in foul trouble in the first half, which is why we watched Danny Green struggle mightily on Trae. Personally, I‚Äôd rather we risk foul trouble and try and stutter the flow of the Hawk‚Äôs offense in Q1 - Q2. Even if that means Ben sits an extra 5 minutes a game to manage his fouls. Tobi and Embiid can carry the offensive slack.   Hopefully we make those adjustments and we get to see Ben vs. KD. Because that would be dope."
"This.  I'll never understand why Doc can be happy with Ben Simmons not knowing how to shoot, like if he learned how to shoot he could very well be your next Lebron"
"I love Bucks fans.   According to them, nobody on this team underperforms in the playoffs, they‚Äôre all amazing etc.  Which begs the question, how the fuck do they get embarrassed so often?  I know that the scapegoat now is Bud, but it was Bledsoe before it, and that assistant coach before that, then Kidd before that.  Imo the problem is pretty straightforward. Their best player has the shooting ability of Ben Simmons. Their best shooter turns into Westbrook every other series."
Read this as Ben Simmons at first and was starting to think he got into the wrong profession.
"Dude, you have Ben Simmons in your user name. I wouldn't be clowning anyone."
Ben Simmons Lol
"It‚Äôs even less excusable than Simmons. At least Ben isn‚Äôt the first option on his team, handling the ball the most and theoretically drawing the most fouls."
Don‚Äôt tell that to sixers fans. They didn‚Äôt wanna trade Ben Simmons for James Harden
Australia... Ben Simmons doesn't shoot threes gtfo
"Nah, he doesn't. I go through this with Ben Simmons all the time. Super frustrating. It's worse with Jokic cause you know it's actually a free two points."
Ben simmons has 0 post moves you can't compare him to Giannis as a scorer.
I mean if i could convince Giannis or Ben Simmons too get a jumper they'd give me COTY
Ben Simmons is still playing as well :|
‚ÄúWhen Ben Simmons makes a 3 we give a big high five!‚Äù. Man that Australian commercial is just *chef kiss
Dame was pretty unstoppable against the nuggets. Curry was dropping 32 ppg while being triple teamed. Luka was responsible for 31/37 of the Dallas Mavericks baskets that one game. Tatum and D-book dropped 50 and 47 (respectively) to beat good teams. Joel Embiid I‚Äôd Joel Embiid. And Trae Young can‚Äôt be stopped by DPOY candidate Ben Simmons. And Kawhi terminated the mavs.  This league has so many unstoppable offensive threats
"I'd still take Australia over them.   Ben Simmons with 3 40% 3 point shooters in Patty Mills, Joe Ingles and Ryan Broekhoff and a big that can hit an open shot in Baynes/Maker/Landale is a great starting 5. Not star-studded, but as a team they fit together so well.   Then they can bring Matisse Thybulle, Exum, Delly, Josh Green, Giddey off the bench.   They're just a smart, well balanced team, there's no teething problems with trying to fit high usage players together, they just have a bunch of solid role players that can defend, shoot and facilitate at a high level."
"&gt; Lebron's playoff career needs no defending. You can look at the numbers, the shot making, the bully ball at the rim.  Your right but you wanted to cherry pick a single game, so I did the same thing.     &gt;Again, can't believe 76er fans believe this shit even after watching this guy play.   Again, legit basketball minds say these things and I'll listen to them then some woodcock on reddit.  And yes Simmons will never become LeBron if he doesnt have a shot, but if eh gets one he will be the closest thing to a LBJ in the NBA.  That doesnt mean he will be a top 5player all time simply that he will most resemble Lebron and his playstyle.    &gt;You're not building an offense around Ben Simmons as an elite driver and finisher. Teams go under or switch every Lebron screen and Westbrook screen and Giannis screen.   Well for one none of them have an All NBA center.  Two, all will at least attempt shots outside the lane which Simmons doesnt do yet.  And I didn't realize we are comparing prime LeBron to a not yet prime Simmons.  That totally makes sense."
I share the same opinion with both Giannis and Ben Simmons. Obviously great players with crazy potential but both will hold their teams back from full potential because of their lack of perimeter scoring ability.
Watching the Ben Simmons ad is funny because he couldn‚Äôt make a regular shot let alone a difficult one like that
"Yes 2021 Danny green is the same caliber defender as simmons and thybulle   Lol doc tried to get away with keeping Danny on him, he couldn‚Äôt..there‚Äôs no doubt in the world Ben and thybulle are better defenders. Will it be enough? Who knows."
Bud is only part of the problem  They need one more shooter and Giannis needs to work on his game  He doesnt need Ben Simmons level of work but he needs to put in some time with Hakeem or a shooting coach something anything to add to his offensive game
Ben Simmons with his current free throw shooting would be the best player on the bulls
tell me about how ben simmons can't shoot free throws.
Have fun with aging Butler who can't shoot and Bam 'Ben Simmons at center' Adebayo
Don't forget the ad of Ben Simmons making a 3
"""Facu trucks Ben Simmons"" was the funnies thread I've seen. I love Facu. Don't mess with Facu, or he will Facu you up."
"I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this, but Ricky Rubio is more useful than Ben Simmons."
Ben Simmons is just a healthy Justise Winslow.
Would you rather have Huerter or Ben Simmons?
"Depends, all things being equal Ben Simmons is a moderately better player than Danny Green ever was. However, Ben Simmons is on a max contract. Danny Green almost won FMVP while making $3.5 million per year.  edit: he also made an all defensive team while making $10 million per year"
"Ben Simmons: 3 time All-Star, 2 time All-Defense, 1 time All-NBA, RoY  Andrew Wiggins: RoY  I understand that it's peak hot take time right now, but comparing Simmons with Wiggins is just dumb."
This is why Reggie Jackson&gt;Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons thread #30
Ben Simmons is a joke. Dude is so overrated.
"Royce ""Ben Simmons"" O'Neale"
Ben Simmons offseason routine is just partying and tryna get into Kendall's pants. No wonder Jimmy left.
Ben Simmons wouldn't even shoot while being deep inside Kendall Jenner
Ben Simmons tied his freethrows made for the series.  Someone get him a free throw shooting coach.
"One free throw to win a million dollars, you taking Ben Simmons or Ben Wallace ?"
"I guess I'm pretty for saying this again.  A while back Ben Simmons responded to someone talking about him not being able to shoot and Ben responded ""I'm still an all-star"". I didn't like it when he said it.   Looks like it came back to bite him in the ass."
imagine comparing a 2x MVP to ben fucking simmons lmao
One Ben Simmons please. Will trade r/DressedSpring1 for him.
"Those rumours were all garbage   Trade talks with Philly went on for literally months. We reached out to them before preseason even started. None of this could possibly happen without Tillman being okay with it.  Maybe it wasn‚Äôt his first choice but saying he wouldn‚Äôt trade his Philly is just wrong. Like this dude is a billionaire who‚Äôs team is literally by far the largest investment he has currently. And people really think this guy is going to damage how successful his investment can be and how much money it can make just because he doesn‚Äôt like Morey.   How does that make sense to anyone? We‚Äôre literally talking about hundreds of millions of dollars that this trade can affect   And it doesn‚Äôt matter how high you are on Simmons. Wall, Ben and Wood isn‚Äôt doing jack shit. Like a 10th seed at best."
ben simmons
Ben Simmons shot 14 free throws and had 8 points. He is not a starter in the NBA.
Ben Simmons would have tried to miss the second and made it
Because I think Embiid would be a great pick and roll player if had a guard who could play pick and roll instead of Ben Simmons.
Whoever said Ben Simmons is a glorified role player spoke the truth. His stock will only go lower from here. I‚Äôm out on that guy
Ben Simmons with the clutch triple single
most nephews wont remember prime danny green. played for the spurs. hasn't been all that good recently. but prime danny green was a bonafide STUD that spaced the floor like a god and could hound players defensively. ben Simmons will be extremely lucky to come close to prime danny green
Patrick Beverley is Ben simmons if Ben simmons was a midget and can shoot a little bit
Ben Simmons was an all-star this year.
"I mean, if we were just gifted Ben Simmons for some reason then a lineup of Simmons, Smart, Brown, Tatum, Williams would be otherworldly on the defensive end."
"Yeah, why would a tanking team take on a 5 year max contract?  And not even for a Ja/Trae/Mitchell/Booker kinda franchise changing player but Ben Simmons  Doesn‚Äôt make sense"
Ben Simmons
It‚Äôs the state of being of the rim at Ben Simmons‚Äô home. Never disturbed
"Those ‚Äúwould you rather have Ben Simmons or Trae Young?‚Äù posts where Sixers fans made it clear they would obviously choose Ben every single time are pretty funny to look back on, ya gotta imagine if Trae can lead a team to 3-2 over the 1 seed that his defense isn‚Äôt horrendous enough to make him a negative.  I get why they said it tho, and I reaaaallly fkn hoped he would prove himself this playoffs, seems to not be the case... Philly should trade him, would love as a Blazer fan if it was for CJ and picks or something but maybe Philly can somehow get something more  even as Ben shows he isn‚Äôt capable of being a playoff threat."
"Ben Simmons, Ben Nuttedinyahu, Ben Franklin, I don't give a damn. Hawks in 6."
"Alright, CJ for Ben Simmons straight up trade next week, who says no? CJ will definitely hit from the free throw line, midrange, 3 point range, etc..."
It‚Äôs October. The cat is somehow still alive as the Sixers come for the season opener. If they lose this one Ben Simmons will be on a cross
whaat if all 4 picked up ben simmons and held him above their head next to the rim but not in the key w/ the ball so he can tap the rim every 23 seconds to reset the shot clock    sixers would be guaranteed a win after scoring jsut 2 points
"o yea true, yea then what the other guy said what are they gonna do have ben simmons shoot the ball lol"
Because Ben Simmons can't shoot.
Wouldn‚Äôt work. The only reason Ben sorta works with the starters is cause Embiid can function as a stretch 5 and pull the other center out of the paint. Playing Simmons with Dwight just clogs the paint.
Ben Simmons is a hard player to sell and I don't think just trading him is a solution he managed to do everything the sixers needed in a while and honestly doc may have seem like a shitty option due to blowing a 3-1 lead but it was a comfort uprade over Brett brown
What‚Äôs everyone favourite ad ? My personal fav is the Ben Simmons one
chris Paul is worth 6 ben simmons
"Question is would they give him up for a stack of role players? Beasley and Rubio? Gives us DLo/Simmons/edwards/mcdaniels?/Kat. Should be enough shooters to open up the floor for Ben and gives much needed defense. Sixers almost certainly say no, but fun to think about"
The Utah Ben Simmons'
Ben Simmons burner account confirmed
Ben Simmons is fucking trash. He should be a sixth man for the rest of his career. If I'm Joell I'm demanding a trade the nanosecond Atlanta wins the series.
"To be fair to Rookie Lonzo Ball, he at least attempted 3s unlike Ben Simmons."
Niang better than Ben Simmons confirmed
#BEN SIMMONS
Ben Simmons 100%
"For a bizarre cross-sports comparison, Jacob DeGrom‚Äôs batting average this season is higher than Ben Simmons‚Äô free throw percentage these playoffs."
Ben Simmons needs to go practice some free throws
[Ben Simmons every time he's about to take a free throw.](https://i.imgur.com/jSkIfxR.jpg)
He just can't be the primary guy imo. Shit I still think we lose in 7 realistically and thats partially due to how good ben simmons is at basketball.
"And Ben Simmons did Collins dirty game 4, in Collins contract year,"
Buddy Heild for Ben Simmons who says no
Does everyone get the Ben Simmons ad or is it just us aussies ?
"If Ben Simmons sits / stands on the shoulder of Embiid, can they foul Simmons?"
Counter point Embiid needs to do a lot on offense because of the lack of scoring by Ben. Embiid was scoring over triple teams last round.  Also Simmons can't have the ball at the end of the game either and he's their best ball handler.
I think Ben Simmons should run back to Australia
"Malik is in jail.  So Ben Simmons, I guess"
This Australian Ben Simmons ad where he makes a three is even more ironic after tonight
"""Guys, I play pass guard, not point guard.""   -- Ben Simmons, probably"
"How many players in this game would you rather have than Ben Simmons? ( for a playoff series).  Starting the bidding at 7 (Mitchell, pg, ingles, bogi, Clarkson, gobert,  Morris).  Can we get an 8? 9? (Batum, Mann,  Reggie , and even kennard are in play here tbh)   11 is honestly in play for the bold bidders."
He is the King Without Crown and Ben Simmons is just the peasant
"He doesn‚Äôt deserve blame imo. It‚Äôs Ben Simmons and Doc Rivers(again). He got Seth Curry, Dwight,etc and a coach that made Tobias play to his full potential. Obviously this is one of the worst collapses by a team ever, but there shouldn‚Äôt be any reason why he‚Äôs really blamed other than a few bad moves here and there"
Ben Simmons needs me to celeb shot
we'll trade Bill Simmons for Ben Simmons
"Also Ben Simmons is arguably the second best defensive player in the league. Trae ain‚Äôt close to second best offensive player in the league so if we are respecting both ends as the same, it isn‚Äôt even a question."
-Ben Simmons
At least Gobert is more useful on offense than Ben Simmons
Where is that Ben Simmons apologist at telling me he isn't needed on offense? LOL
I still think Ben Simmons for Lu Dort would be sweet. Just not sure about the logistics though. I like Lu Dort and personally I would take Dort over Simmons any day of the week.
Ben Simmons needs a megathread
"Agree to disagree, I do not think we will ever agree but you have a lot of faith in this guy man, Doc might adjust to win the series so watch out. Trae is awesome do not get me wrong but he is no Ben Simmons"
"Should the Rockets still have traded Harden for Simmons?   Seriously though, Bill Simmons is as big of a hack as Ben Simmons"
-makes a Ben Simmons post
"This makes me happy. For so long, this sub was a Ben Simmons fan club and now those guys are no where to be found."
I would like to formally apologize for my regrettable comments I made when I said that Ben Simmons is a better basketball player than Netanyahu. I would like to emphasize that I am not antisem-
"This comment from the Sixers sub is top quality   Kendrick Lamar once said ""but the one in front of the gun lives forever."" That's because the shooter is Ben Simmons"
"It‚Äôs awful.  Me and some other Sixer fans have been saying this for at least a year now.  The other fans say all kinds of bad shit about you if you criticize Ben Simmons.  They love to quote the stat line and talk about the defense.  I wanted him traded because: He can‚Äôt shoot, he refuses to try, you get almost nothing from him in close games and clutch playoff matchups, he‚Äôs a bad free throw shooter and he‚Äôs mentally weak.  All those things went as expected.  It‚Äôs embarrassing to have a player who‚Äôs natural talent FAR exceeds what he is as a player."
"I disagree wholeheartedly, knowing he‚Äôs tried. The same way anyone can sing, anyone can shoot. It‚Äôs all about finding the right method. He is capable; we‚Äôve seen him shoot threes. But he is [afraid to fail](https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/76ers/sixers-ben-simmons-jump-shot-joel-embiid-brett-brown). He needs to get over it if they‚Äôre going to have any chance of winning a title."
It's sad that I can shoot free throws better than Ben Simmons.
What‚Äôs this y‚Äòall stuff. I‚Äôm not a Celtics fan. How much would Ben  Simmons possibly command? Philly is going to have to be the one to throw in firsts to get teams to take him
"Honestly, Ben Simmons is a slightly better version of Michael Jordan. The difference is, Jordan had Scottie Pippen to carry him to 6 championships. If the 76ers are serious about contending, they should see if they can trade Embiid and a couple picks for Julius Randle or maybe Jaren Jackson Jr."
"Ben Simmons ""franchise"" playerü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£"
Ben Simmons suddenly start shooting Steph Curry percentages from the line
"Nah, Ben Simmons isn‚Äôt a pylon on defense"
"Lu Dort is going to have a higher ceiling than Ben Simmons. Sixers fan mocked me for this take, but Lu Dort would of got you buckets and made his free throws all while being a pretty good defender.  Edit: sorry. I only said this because from what I understand Harden was never going to Philadelphia anyhow because of the bad blood between Morey and Tillman."
royce o neal is ben simmons in the west
So Ben Simmons is untradeable huh? üòÇ he literally lost them this game and will continue to do so until that man learns how to shoot
I‚Äôd rather have a half eaten candy bar than Ben Simmons
"You know that ‚Äûwe ain‚Äôt come to play school?‚Äú kid? That‚Äôs Ben simmons, but replace school with basketball"
I will buy a Ben Simmons jersey the moment he swishes a gran
Ben Simmons shoots free throws like he just had his talent taken from him
"I‚Äôve been saying this for years now. The guy is fool‚Äòs gold. Every year in the regular season when teams are playing no defense he puts up good numbers, and every year he shrinks in the playoffs. I heard people predict the 6ers would come out of the East. And that was before the injuries to harden and kyrie. On the shoulders of Ben simmons? Come on."
Danny green. In his prime he‚Äôs better player than Ben Simmons too he‚Äôs more helpful to his team
I would rather have current Danny green than rookie Ben Simmons.
"&gt; We would never be in a position to win without Joel.  I agree.  Does that change the fact that he choked those two free throws?  No, it doesn't.  Acknowledging that he choked doesn't mean he's trash or that he's he didn't have a great game.  &gt; Ben being shit at shooting is something that is consistent.  I also agree with this, and I think his free throw shooting is more problematic than whatever downfalls Embiid has.  However, just because Simmons has serious problems doesn't mean that Embiid doesn't have problems of his own.  I never said Embiid lost the game, I just said that he had his own share of problems in the game that contributed to losing.  One singular player is never to blame for losing a game."
"Ben Simmons shot the ball 4 times and missed **10** free throws.   However, doc played him for 38 minutes. I‚Äôm guessing a little of column a, a little column b"
"How about Ben Simmons to the Rockets for Anthony Lamb, Danuel House, and a 2026 SRP?"
You are 100% talking out of your ass. No one has ever even suggested that to be the case. Fultz/Simmons/Embiid was the big 3 and I don‚Äôt know how you can watch this team play and think that the player Fultz was supposed to be (25ppg 3 level scorer) wouldn‚Äôt fit with Joel and Ben.
"If Barkley can do it, Ben Simmons can do it too!"
"Yeah.  Honestly the sixers with bridges might be in the finals rn.   Obviously he isn‚Äôt teaching Ben Simmons to shoot, but he might be that little bump that they need. He‚Äôs a good defender, good offensive player, and cheap (for now)."
this means there's hope for ben simmons
Things Ben Simmons cant say
No future? They are about to draft a slightly smaller version of Ben Simmons who can actually fucking shoot the ball. Ha. I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs not a bad start towards a brighter future.
Well he had fucking Ben Simmons guarding him like an animal lol
There‚Äôs hope for Ben Simmons
Ben Simmons
"Ben Simmons.  He's going to average 35/12/10.  Also 55% from 3.  95% from the line.  MVP, Defensive player of the year.  So line up your trades now boys cause it's for SURE going to happen."
Like ben simmons shooting free throws with his right hand
"everybody has their role... but it will help the team a lot if he could shoot better. thing is, it's not like he's incapable of doing it. he shot 39% from three before, it's not like we're asking Ben Simmons to be a good shooter. Dray has the ability, but he has regressed. Is it not too much to ask him to just get back to where he was?"
"76ers good, they got Ben Simmons"
Imagine that scenario  Kobe and CP3 constantly getting at Dwigt from being soft.   Dwigt is constantly scared and does a Ben Simmons wide open dunk-pass in the finals. Which loses them the series  After the game Dwigt disappears off the face of the earth.
"DAJ in his prime shot in the sub 40s from the FT line on volume. It basically would be Ben Simmons all over again. He'd be played off the court, hack a DAJ was real. He put up flashy dunks and good box stats during the regular season but you wouldn't be able to rely on him at this juncture. Ayton is already more skilled, more comfortable on switches and shoots 75%+ from the line. Would take Ayton 10 times out of 10 in the playoffs."
It‚Äôs pretty clear who‚Äôs fault it is. Bench Ben Simmons
"Cavs get: Philly‚Äôs 2022 1st rounder, 2023 first rounder, Minnesota‚Äôs 2022 1st rounder  Minnesota get: Ben Simmons, Kevin Love  Sixers get: rid of Simmons"
I think your fan base is validated in thinking he‚Äôs gonna be a stud. I also think you‚Äôre right on how the fan base would feel if they got rid of him. But as someone‚Äôs who‚Äôs a Ben fan and not as reactionary as most sixers fans I think once y‚Äôall watch him play 82 games you‚Äôll see why the sixers have been so resistant to lowball offers.   It‚Äôs definitely fun Af to watch someone blossom into a star but most players primes don‚Äôt start till around 25 and by then the other two will be 30. Obviously ant is ahead of the curve so it makes the decision that much harder. I do believe if the trade does happen that at least for the next 3 years it‚Äôs gonna be hard to argue that Simmons doesn‚Äôt make their team better.   I definitely hear your worry about Edwards living up to his potential but say he gets to 25 ppg 4rebounds 5assists on good shooting splits over 3 years. Say Simmons on t-wolves averages 16-8-8 with DPOY contention. T wolves prob win more games with Ben. Now obviously the worry can be Ant becomes a 30+ ppg guy on a playoff team lol but chances are that doesn‚Äôt happen for a couple years. I really think the big worry is that the organization doesn‚Äôt want to look like they wasted some of KATs years.  I do think the decision maker on both sides are fucked lol. Best we can hope for is a win win scenario.
&gt; Ben Simmons needed a man to hold him accountable  It's working out real well so far...
There‚Äôs no chance that‚Äôs happening. Sixers aren‚Äôt going to trade Simmons and not get back Ant or someone from a 3rd team.   The biggest factor in bringing Russell was to keep KAT happy. Ben and KAT are boys just like they‚Äôre boys with Russell. They have complementary play styles and are close in age. There was a report saying Minn views Russell as part of their core and want to keep it that way. That only leaves Ant. It‚Äôs a lot more realistic than this sub would have you believe.
"Unfortunately that means absolutely nothing as a basketball coach. It also kept him from being fired when he should've been, so I dont appreciate his kindness when it directly fucked over my team  You wanna be nice, go work at a daycare. Ben Simmons needed a man to hold him accountable"
I would swap Brandon Ingram with Russel Westbrook. Then I would move Ben Simmons down to tier 8 while moving up Pascal Siakam into tier 6 and SGA into tier 7. Finally I would swap Julius Randle and Kyle Lowry.
Mikal Bridges for Ben Simmons who says no

"Let me break it down for your dumb ass.  The Sixers have existed for 70 years  They have been to the Conference Finals only NINE of those 70 years.  Pistons went to the conference Finals 6 years in a row, back to back Finals, and took down Shaq and Kobe preventing the 3peat and breaking up the Lakers while changing the landscape of the league literally changed the rules to prevent low scoring games since the Pistons held teams under 70 pts for 11 out of 82 regular season games.  Your Sixers team was the butt of all jokes and still is.  Tobias Harris is due 40M until 2024. Ben Simmons is due 40M until 2025. LMFAO. Good luck finding any takers for those albatross deals.  You think Embiid wants to stay in Philly?  How did Fultz work out for you? Seems like he carved himself a nice niche in Orlando. Really could have used his scoring in yet another flame out in this year's playoffs. Even a new coach couldnt save you.  Your team tanks, doesnt develop players, and has ZERO to show for decades of shitty play except a loss in the Conference Finals. This was their year and they blew it.  I get why that leaves you feeling bitter. Hope you feel better and are able to get out of that shit hole and actually see and experience other parts of the world to know that ""Philly #1 DURRRR"" is not always the case lol"
Chuck improved his swing as much as Ben Simmons improved his shot
"*After a key of cocaine, Elton leaned over to Gerrson and softly whispered ""I want you right here, right now."" Gerron slowly undressed, caressed Elton's throbbing manhood, and inserted it into his mouth. Elton then turned Rosas over on his stomach, and proceeded to roughly penetrate Gerrson's anus. After a minute, they both screamed and climaxed.*  *The next morning Ben Simmons was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Ricky Rubio, Malik Beasley, and 3 first round picks, with a pick swap.*  --END CREDITS--"
Where's Ben Simmons
They probably got together and said hello and joked that there were probably going to be Ben Simmons rumors.
They could go after Ben Simmons if they want ü§£üòÖ
Ben Simmons and Giannis?
"I used to hate on Steph Curry for overdoing the various cocky things he got ‚Äúinfamous‚Äù for with the haters but after seeing him compete over the last few years, I respect him so much.  Same case with Giannis. I thought his whole ESL immigrant shit was eaten up by the media and dick riders alike but dawg after seeing Ben Simmons do nothing with his talent this playoffs and Giannis just competing regardless of his troubles, whole new respect"
Damn. Feels like a Ben Simmons burn
"The best chance the Sixers have of swapping out Ben and getting better is through Chicago, Portland, or Washington being completely dysfunctional to the point of one of their star players requesting and being granted a mid season trade.   That seems about as likely as Simmons finally  expanding his offensive game and shooting from beyond 3 ft around the rim."
It‚Äôs impossible to get him. I don‚Äôt know why people don‚Äôt get this. Wolves are not giving up dlo or Kat. And they‚Äôre 100% not getting rid of edwards. Philly doesn‚Äôt want anyone else for simmons. Also if we got Ben somehow and kept them then he‚Äôd have to play the 4 for us not the 1
Wanna show me a source or Ben Simmons making all nba this season? Regular season awards doesn‚Äôt change how useless he is in the playoffs anyway.     Edwards has future all star written all over him
"‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a better free throw shooter than Ben Simmons tho, so it‚Äôs not all bad.‚Äù"
"Ben Simmons for me‚Ä¶ I can pass up wide open shots and scoring opportunities as well, plus if I do get fouled I can make more free throws!"
Lol. You‚Äôre so mad. I‚Äôm well aware of the Minnesota sports issues! Unfortunately for you none of that has to do with Ben Simmons. Go cry a river to your mom.
"Is there a three way trade to be had between the Wolves, Sixers, and Pacers where they all come out on top?  How's this for a three way trade:   Sixers get:   * Malcom Brogdon  * Malik Beasley  Wolves get:   * Ben Simmons  Pacers get:   * Ricky Rubio  * Tyrese Maxey  * Jarrett Culver  * Wolves 2023, 2025 1sts   Brogdon moves into the Sixers starting lineup as a hyper-efficient 20ppg point guard. Beasley gives microwave scoring off the bench, averaging 20ppg himself last season. Sixers offense gets superpowered by moving on from Simmons and giving up one of their three promising guard prospects to win now.   Timberwolves move their expensive backup guards, a bust that needs a change of scenery, and picks that probably won't be in the lottery for Ben Simmons, who slots right into their offense. DLo/Ant/Ben/McDaniels/KAT is sp00ky for real. Again on the picks - they don't need any more young prospects, so moving a few picks for better players, now, is a likely and sensible move.   Pacers move on from Brogdon to try to build for the future while continuing to make the playoffs, which is their MO. They get Rubio, who can start in Brogdon's slot. They get Maxey, a promising guard prospect. They get Culver, who's really just filler but is still only 22yo and could be a reclamation project. And they get two 1st round picks that, who knows, could still be pretty good picks, knowing the Wolves."

No offense man but you're basically saying if you took the team that just went 23-49 on the season and added just Ben Simmons they'd then be how good exactly?
