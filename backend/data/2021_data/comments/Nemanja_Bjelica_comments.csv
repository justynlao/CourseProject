"&gt;Apparently Nemanja Bjelica is available, I would agree if you can get him no brainer to then use him as a backup 5   do you think he can play it effectively? i can't bother to keep up with bad West coast teams due to being on Euro timezone"
"The Nets are going to get like Ed Davis and Nemanja Bjelica at the deadline for 2nd round picks or as buyout guys, and all this hand-wringing about the Nets' depth will probably look a little ridiculous.    Didn't the 2018 Warriors use their MLE on Nick Young? It just seems like if your core guys are bonafide stars, the depth issues can be solved so long as the main guys execute well individually and reasonably complement each other's games."
How does 1 lightly used Nemanja Bjelica sound?
Promise I didn't cheat:  Rafer Alston  Vlade Divac  Alex Caruso?  Svi Mykhailuk  Jae Crowder  Joel Embiid  Hubie Brown?  Milos Teodosic???  Al-Farouq Aminu  Manu Ginobili  Luc Mbah a Moute  Emmanuel Mudiay  Thon Maker  Bismack Biyombo  Jay Triano?  Zydrunas Ilgauskas  Greg Oden?  ???  Marc Gasol  ???  Chauncey Billups  Stephen A. Smith  Jakob Poeltl  Frank Ntilikina  Michael Olowokandi  Rodions Kurucs  Pascal Siakam  Jacques Vaughn  Timothe Luwawu-Cabarot  Masai Ujiri  Arcidiacono?  ???

If he is traded, I could see NYK or DAL  **Lamarcus Aldridge**  Terrible contract.  That being said, NYK or buyout"
"Someone like KAT, perhaps? Or were you thinking more of a Nemanja Bjelica"
"For the uninitiated, the Kings roster. (Positions could be debated)  PG: De'Aaron Fox | Tyrese Haliburton | Jahmi'us Ramsey  SG: Buddy Hield | Cory Joseph | Kyle Guy | Justin James  SF: Harrison Barnes | DaQuan Jeffries  PF: Marvin Bagley III | Jabari Parker | Nemanja Bjelica  C: Richaun Holmes | Hassan Whiteside (Out) | Norvel Pelle  Whiteside's out for Health and Safety Protocols. Luke Walton's not a good coach, but how the heck is he supposed to win games with that roster? Fox is good, Hield will get his, Barnes is solid, and Bagley/Holmes are not terrible but they're below-average starters. Somehow though, their bench is even more dire. How many of these guys would even start on a good team? I think it's a bit extreme, but only Fox and Hield/Barnes could start for certain teams. I don't think anyone past Bagley/Holmes/Haliburton would crack a rotation, and some of those (like Bagley) would even be questionable."
Yeah but if you asked them all to say Nemanja Bjelica i think youd get about 10-15 different answers
"Before the draft, this subreddit was filled with nephews being upvoted saying Luka is trash because he's going to fail in the NBA like the other Euroleague MVPs (Nemanja Bjelica, Milos Teodosic) who failed in the NBA."
"Yes but unfortunately that's by design of our defense  Primary guys of the offense like Beal RJ and Steph will have the worst shooting nights of their careers but guys like Marcus Morris, Nemanja Bjelica, Kent Bazemore and others all scored 24+ against us cause we can't guard a 3 to save our lives"
"For perspective, Jan Vesely was the MVP in '19. Nemanja Bjelica won MVP and then next year took the league by storm and brought the Timberwolves back to relevance."
"Nah, far too expensive (salary-wise, for matching). Blake’s an option if he gets bought out, but I don’t think he’s too likely.  Nemanja Bjelica, PJ Tucker, and Mike Muscala are all decent backups that can play the 4 or 5, and would be a great fit in Ben-led lineups when Embiid’s out or off the floor. They’d effectively be upgrades on Mike Scott, and alternates to Dwight depending on matchups. Any of those 3 guys should likely be available for a second rounder or two, I don’t think any teams are paying a first for them, and they’re all definitely on the trading block.  Some higher end options are Thad Young and Larry Nance, less stretch-y (low volume shooters) but better overall players (both guys are having great years). I think these are nice options, but less likely since the cost would be higher, and I don’t think Cleveland sells on Nance unless they get an offer they really can’t say no to. I also think there’s teams that need a guy like Thad more than us too (Celtics, possibly), so I don’t think it’s likely the right fit."
"Sacramento please.  Take Cory Joseph, Jabari Parker, and Nemanja Bjelica."

But you haven’t considered the possibility that Nemanja Bjelica might win
Give me Nemanja Bjelica any day
Nemanja Bjelica is pretty sexy tbh but i can’t think of any other role players who’ve had a glow up yet.
But Austin rivers is no Nemanja Bjelica
Even while getting stomped everyone was hyped up watching Nemanja Bjelica drain threes  😢...
Yeah you dont wanna fuck with eastern eurooeans (or any kids that grew up in a generation with war torn surroundings or the close memory of that war). Like when Nemanja Bjelica totally son'd Arron Afflalo when AA tried to start shit: https://youtu.be/S-KMnvZFxFE
"No, they didn't. Sources came out with Houston's asking price.  - Herro, Duncan, Precious &amp; Nunn (combined salary: $9,732,122) - Salary Filler ($31,522,798 worth) - Two 1st-Round Picks (miami only has their 2022/2024) - 4 Pick Swaps (legitimately did not have enough picks to swap)  That means mortgaging the future in two ways: the young players **and** the pick economy for 2-and-a-half years of James Harden. Not to mention that Miami's only way to create the filler would've been to trade Olynyk &amp; Iguodala for Harden at the last minute.  But fuck it, because *Oh please...* came so easily to you, here's what the roster makeup would've looked like fresh out of the trade, completely ignoring that we didn't have the picks or the swaps for Houston.  PG: Goran Dragic/Gabe Vincent (2-Way)  SG: James Harden/Max Strus (2-Way)  SF: Jimmy Butler/Trevor Ariza (who was acquired with a 2027 SRP + meyers)  PF: Nemanja Bjelica/KZ Okpala   C: Bam Adebayo/Dewayne Dedmon (f/a signing)  If you think **that** 10-man rotation does any better against the Milwaukee Bucks than the one we've pushed out there twice, you're completely out of your mind. Go Hornets."
"Take Nemanja Bjelica, Aleksej Pokusevski and Ivica Zubac out and they sweep in unison."
Nemanja Bjelica
I really wanted the Warriors to go after Nemanja Bjelica with our DPE at the deadline.
Surprised by Nemanja Bjelica on the Heat. Turns out he's making $7M there now. idk about that one.
It’s Nemanja Bjelica time
Orlando Magic starting lineup:  Cole Anthony -  Gary Harris -  Dwayne Bacon - Moritz Wagner - Mo Bamba   Team Serbia starting lineup:  Stefan Jović - Bogdan Bogdanović - Nemanja Bjelica - Nikola Jokić - Boban Marjanović  Why exactly do people think Orlando could beat Serbia?

"This article right there means when you see a player from Turkey on second round, get him. Mehmet Okur, Ersan Ilyasova, Omer Asik, Cedi Osman, Zaza Pachulia, Bojan Bogdanovic, Nemanja Bjelica..."
"This is the right answer. Some people don’t understand how much higher the level of play in the NBA is than in every other league in the world.     Just look at who’s won the EuroLeague MVP for example: Jan Vesely, Nando de Colo, Nemanja Bjelica, Sergio Rodríguez. These guys ranged from scrubs to under average players in the NBA but are top players in Europe"
"well, they signed 3 other forwards on mins (otto porter jr, nemanja bjelica, andre iguodala) and are already out of roster spots...."
Could dray and simmons play together if nemanja bjelica is on the floor? Ive never seen the guy play but im told hes a stretch 5. That might work.
Big T Wolves fan but I’ve also rooted for every team the GOAT Nemanja Bjelica plays significant minutes on
 Nemanja Bjelica joining the warriors. Undisputed GOAT joins a very good team
How did he insult the city? I’m confused as to where he said something bad about the city. All he said as that it wasn’t his preferred destination. Nemanja Bjelica said he was happy to finally be with a winning organization after leaving Miami. THAT is some disparaging shit.
"&gt;It just can’t happen in less than 60 seconds at all period.  We are talking plausible deniability. If during an investigation a team and their signing says they presented the offer and it was accepted immediately which is why the deal was closed in under a minute...Adam Silver is going to say ""No..no..that cant happen""?      &gt;Not to mention when we call something a “done deal” this implies signatures have happened  None of these FA signings that have been announced are ""done deals"" (im not sure about the sign and trades). They are all verbal agreements and nothing has been signed. Thats the reason why a couple of players have backed out of deals after they were announced e.g. DeAndre Jordan, Nemanja Bjelica, Yogi Ferrell"
The disrespect to Nemanja Bjelica
This dude has complained his entire career. Maybe you didn’t play because you’re not good?   Next Summer 2022 reddit post: Nemanja Bjelica has joined the San Antonio Spurs on a vet min. “I just really wanted to play somewhere that’s focused on winning a championship. He [Steve Kerr] doesn’t seem to understand what it really takes.”
"Serbia could roll out:  Milos Teodosic  Bogdan Bogdonovic  Nemanja Bjelica  Nikola Jokic  Boban Marjanovic   Not sure if it’s better, but they could definitely compete"

"You may have seen the news but the Warriors signed Nemanja Bjelica.   So now they just need to land Patty Mills and boom, successful off season. Some great draft picks, some nice veterans, if Klay looks like Klay by the end of the season (a big if, I know) then this roster has a chance at making the finals."
"Free agent F Nemanja Bjelica has agreed to a one-year deal with the Golden State Warriors, source tells ESPN."
"That still happens now.  Just scouring nbadraft.net , the first white guys i come across:  Franz Wagner - Nemanja Bjelica  Josh Giddey - Joe Ingles"
Nemanja Bjelica
Nemanja Bjelica
"1. Nemanja Bjelica. There, fixed it for you"
Nemanja Bjelica
Weird way to spell Nemanja Bjelica
Not a Heat fan and I love both but just wanted to say that neither of these dudes could hold a candle to prime Nemanja Bjelica.
This is stupid. It’s obvious that next year’s MVP is Nemanja Bjelica.
"It's extra-interesting when the star is not American and decides to skip playing for the National Team ... that kind of went the opposite of what you're describing  I have to say our Serbian fans, after an initially rocky relationship, have really embraced Jamal. But every off-season we get a bunch of fun proposals to trade random guys for Nemanja Bjelica and Bogdan Bogdanovic lol"
And Nemanja Bjelica
I remember when Aaron Afflao tried to sucker punch step to Nemanja Bjelica and Nemanja got him in a headlock and shut him down. He had some funny post game comments.
"One time when I went to Downtown Sac, I got there several hours before a game and was just chilling at the Starbucks down the walkway from G1C, Nemanja Bjelica was just sitting there in his workout gear and a towel draped over his shoulders looking like hell just slurping down some coffee looking at his cell phone. The Starbucks people told me that he drinks a ton of coffee and is in there all the time at all hours of the day and always drinks coffee before games.   Everyone looks but mostly just leaves him chillin.   One time I saw Harry Giles pet the robot security bots that hang out outside G1C. It was really weird.   Sacramento is really just pasta."
Makes perfect sense. That also explains why Nemanja Bjelica has made so many NBA all star teams.
"Ohhhh that dude? Taking Lebron over him no doubt. Sengun won MVP of the Turkish league and he went pick 18. Other Euroleague MVP’s are Nemanja Bjelica and Nando de Colo. Winning euro league MVP doesn’t make you the best prospect of all time. James’ size, athleticism, mind, and skill is still gonna be miles ahead of Luka."
"Dejan is great at developing talent, he was the coach for Mega, he coached Jokić, he also had consistent NBA talent/picks play for him and he made Mega the best place for player development in the world basically and I just read an interview him, he looks fully dedicated to give his best, so hopefully he'll do a good job for you guys!  Nemanja Bjelica is a fantastic roleplayer, he has experience he has range you'll surely love him."
"The Warriors have a new Serbian movement with big man Coach Dejan Milojević and Nemanja Bjelica. I'm wondering if you know of the history those two might have in Serbian leagues or perhaps on the national team, and also what kind of player might they be able to mold Wiseman into?"
Holy shit i assumed that was Nemanja Bjelica or something
LeMickey got nothing on the true GOAT Nemanja Bjelica
“Nemanja Bjelica isn’t an all time great.” Breaks my heart every single time 😔
"&gt; bench = supporting cast  No, bench specifically refers to…the bench.   &gt; And what exactly did the Warriors do this offseason? Get back 38yo Iggy? Sign Otto Porter while losing Oubre?  Drafted Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody. Signed Otto Porter Jr, Nemanja Bjelica, and Andre Iguodala.   &gt;  No one seriously thinks Warriors got better if we don't factor in Klay yet.  They improved significantly. You can’t seriously think Oubre, Bazemore, Paschall, and Wanamaker contribute more to winning than OPJ, Moody, Kuminga, Bjelica, and Iguodala…"
"Eh, I'll give you Nemanja, but you heat Bjelica once and the pronunciation sticks. Same with the soft J in Bojan.  With regards to Bogdanović, its a name already in the public lexicon of 60+ folks and film buffs in the US through Peter Bogdanovich."
I feel like names like Nemanja Bjelica or Bojan Bogdanović are way more unintuitive for native english speakers
With this roster that's going to be challenging.  LeBron and AD went off in game 1 while Steph played like trash (his own words) and they still lost to Nemanja Bjelica and Jordan Poole.
you could ask the same about Nemanja Bjelica
"Bjelica is a good addition to the team. He does things Wiseman cant do, I mean, he is only a sophomore and Nemanja has played for years now but plus a Euroleague MVP on his resume. Im curious if Steve Kerr will play them both on the court."
I'm spending the morning practicing how to pronounce Nemanja Bjelica.  Nem-on-ya  Byel-eeza
"Nemanja ""Jeremiah 11:11"" Bjelica"

"It seems it but its not worth putting a lot of stock into. He definitely had a bad game, but no one is in here posting about how Nemanja Bjelica had +20 for the Warriors because it's not really all that important for a single game."
"I just went to his Wikipedia page because someone said he was older than Westbrook and I was like ""no way is that true"" (turns out it is!) and I now have a screenshot of it saying:  ""Nemanja Bjelica (Serbian Cyrillic: Немања Бјелица, pronounced [němaɲa bjělitsa]; born 9 May 1988) is a Serbian professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA) commonly regarded as Jokic 2.0. Also is a minority owner of the LA Lakers.""  It's freaking me out because usually when someone's all ""look someone did this to Wikipedia"" I'm like ""by someone you mean you did that yourself"" but I swear to God I didn't."
"Me: Mom, can we have Nikola Jokic?  Mom: We have Nikola Jokic at home.  (At home): Nemanja Bjelica"
Steve Kerr: Can we have Jokic? Bob Myers: We have Jokic at home Jokic at home - Nemanja Bjelica
You spelled Nemanja Bjelica wrong
Can’t forget about The legend Nemanja Bjelica
"Some hot takeaways from this game:  * Jordan Poole is the greatest Jordan, even better than Jordan Nwora  * Is Curry the second worst player only above Westbrick?  * Is Nemanja Bjelica a secret twin of Nikola Jokic?  * Will Lakers make the play-ins?  * Who will face Warriors in the finals - Bucks or Nets?"
Warriors welcome Nemanja “David Lee” Bjelica
"If you tell me Nemanja Bjelica would be a difference-maker with a double-double, against a LeBron/AD/Melo superteam, I would say, ""Yea, I see it."""
Nemanja Bjelica navigated the intermediate range perfectly tonight. Made the right decision every time. Boris Diaw esque
Was that Nemanja Bjelica or was that prime Bill Walton?  Lakers had no answer for his playmaking down the stretch.
I love Nemanja Bjelica. This team is soooo much better than last year.
nemanja bjelica looks like an athletic jokic out there. dude has been liberated by the god of freewheeling offense and he's promulgating the scripture to all of us
Nemanja Bjelica is actually the GOAT huh wow
NEMANJA  BJELICA
"Nemanja ""Boris Diaw"" Bjelica"
"Cant wait for bill simmons to talk about how nemanja bjelica was a sneaky good signing for the warriors and that he always liked him, all whilst mispronouncing his name 17 different ways"
"Nemanja Bjelica apparently only makes great passes, screens, cuts, and shots and dominates the Lakers and Lebron in crunch time in the 4th quarter in LA"
I think I'm in love with Nemanja Bjelica
Nemanja “Jokic” Bjelica
"Nemanja ""Nikola Jokic"" Bjelica"
We have unlocked Nemanja Bjelica!  League on fucking notice.
lakers losing to Warriors big 2 Nemanja Bjelica &amp; Jordan Poole
Nemanja Bjelica is dominating the Lakers
"Unrelated to the flagrant just now but Nemanja Bjelica is one of the most underrated signings of this offseason. He's been huge for GSW tonight,"
"Nemanja ""Magic Johnson"" Bjelica"
Nemanja Bjelica
"God I remember this like it was yesterday. I still contend Serbia has, after USA, the mlst talented teams and skill but their whole histroy success or defeats are riddled with fights, ego and discohesions.  2000-2002.- Two euro golds and wolrd gold, knocling out USA...Radmanovic kicked out forom the tournament in the quarterfinals. Fights between playerz.. coach pesic european legend  2004-2005 - changing of guard but massive failures including this tournament. Obradovic legend calling out Jaric and Igor Rakocevic as main culprits.  2005-2009- dark ages  2009-2015 - relatively stable and revival with silvers at the euros, olympics ans world...duda ivkovic trainer led by Krstic and teodosic with bogdanovic coming up but even then there were rumblings of locker room tension, managerial side deals, favoritism  2016-2109 - coach sale djordjevic three silvers (olympics, world, euro)) and 2019 with the catastroohic collapse, rumblings of Bjelica Nemanja ffighting with other players, Jokic and djordjevic the coach fighting. Before that Kalinic and Micov incidents  2020- stacked serbia team losing to italy in olympic qualifiers to italy. igor Kokoakov horrible loss..again media had rumblinga of locker room trouble never speciifed. PS media glorifies Jokic in USA while in Serbia he is not the most highly regarded  Summary. European basketball doesnt wxist without serbian coaches and its a shame there are no successors ie onxw again due to ego of not taking apprentices.  Serbia has some of the most talented players but if they were even 50 percent better mentally an already rich history would be even gretaer. Serbian ego in short"
Jordan Poole Andrew Wiggins Otto Porter Jr Nemanja Bjelica Kevon Looney
AD: Yo wtf yall cant make me play center they got *Nemanja Bjelica* out there what am i even supposed to do??  Lebron: dude you think you have it bad i have to switch onto *Jordan Poole* sometimes
Replace Webber with nemanja bjelica and this list is perfect
"Otto Porter Jr, Nemanja Bjelica, and (Return of) Andre Igoudala. Also the massive leap of growth by Jordan Poole"
"It's mostly our early picks though. Kris Dunn, Jarrett Culver, Justin Patton, Shabazz Muhammad, Derrick Williams, Wesley Johnson, Johnny Flynn all inside the the top 20 and are all busts surrounded by better picks in the draft. Add to that Wiggins and Rubio not living up to the hype. Even going way back and trading Brandon Roy for Randy Foye.  Then you look and see Gorgui Dieng, Tyus Jones, Josh Okogie, Jaden McDaniels, Nikola Pekovic, Glenn Robinson, Nemanja Bjelica and none of them are world beaters but they all will have/had nice NBA careers. You need to hit with your early picks more often than we did. It seems things may be changing but I won't believe it until it's actually happened."
Nemanja Bjelica
"OP said stretch 5 but pretty clearly is asking who has the most range as a center. Porziņģis actually has a pretty good argument for longest range for a center.   Out of centers who took 28+ feet 3PTA in 2019-20, KP ranked first by far hitting nearly 38% of his deep deep 3s (33/88), Nemanja Bjelica shot 34% and Brook Lopez shot 25% both on less attempts. Porziņģis actually had the 2nd highest deep 3% out of any player with 75+ attempts, first was Dāvis Bertāns with 34/78 (44%)"
I LOVE NEMANJA BJELICA
took me forever to figure out NB and AB are Nemanja Bjelica and Avery Bradley wtf
"Just like how Otto Porter jr and Nemanja Bjelica help the Warriors Nunn and Ariza can help the Lakers, and if anything I’m underselling the impact that those 2 would have on the team. They are both guys who will command 18+ minutes a game and furthermore it will push guys who aren’t rotation level out of the lineup."
Nemanja Bjelica has come back to earth since his hot start to the season
Arron Afflalo nearly killed Nemanja Bjelica if Nemanja didn’t suddenly decide he was part of the Matrix
"The Warriors like to collect former MVPs:  * Kevin Durant, 2014 NBA MVP * JaVale McGee, 2012 &amp; 2013 Shaqtin' a Fool MVP * Juan Toscano-Anderson, 2018 LNBP MVP * Otto Porter Jr., 2015 Shaqtin' a Fool MVP * Nemanja Bjelica, 2015 EuroLeague MVP"
"No one said Otto Porter Jr or Nemanja Bjelica? Both are playing at the minimum and are also playing way above how much they are making. Bjelica can playmake, spread the floor by making 3s, and can also get boards for the Warriors. Otto Porter is elite from the corner, and he has been great at setting screens for steph. Both can be starters on other teams on any given day!"
In the first half it was Nemanja Bjelica (along with Steph) who was keeping us in the game
"Aww, Ricky and Nemanja hugging. That's the most I've ever seen Bjelica smile."
&gt; Nemanja   didn't realize this was actually one of his brothers and at first thought it was a bjelica joke
he had already backed out of the lowball offer and was headed to Europe      https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24153933/nemanja-bjelica-sacramento-kings-agree-3-year-deal
"May want to re read the post, it says Nemanja Bjelica."
The Lakers trade for difference makers... the Warriors trade for Nemanja Bjelica FML
"They have literally what is said in the title, steph curry and draymond. And while role players are extremely important in the playoffs, most series are won by the stars, not by nemanja bjelica.   Also saying “here comes warriors brigade” is the weakest way to defend a shitty take. I’m not a warriors fan but that weak shit instantly made me respond."
How did the Warriors go from non playoff team to best team in the league? Otto Porter Jr and Nemanja Bjelica ain't doing that shit. TEACH ME YOUR WAYS
Nemanja Bjelica. That MF is a brick wall and all kinds of Serbian lack of fucks given.
Juan Tuscano Anderson and Nemanja Bjelica carrying Steph smh.
"I really liked this write-up of a play Kerr designed for him. They've run it a couple of times, and it seems to work like a charm.  https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2021/11/8/22769565/warriors-rockets-gary-payton-ii-otto-porter-jr-nemanja-bjelica-film-breakdown"
https://kingsherald.com/articles/nba-trade-rumors-boston-celtics-marcus-smart-trade-sacramento-kings-harrison-barnes-nemanja-bjelica-trade/  I also remember Sam amick mentioning it on a radio show with the trade deadline nearing
Put some respect on euro mvp Nemanja Bjelica
"Kevon Looney yelled ""THERE YOU GO!"" Jordan Poole gave a look of pleasant surprise. Nemanja Bjelica belted, ""WE GOT A [SERBIAN LANGUAGE] SQUAD NOW."" And before GP2 hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Steph Curry hugged him and said ""Y'all look so different."""
