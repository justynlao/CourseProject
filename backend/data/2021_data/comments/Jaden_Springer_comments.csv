I saw a mock draft today where we were projected to get the 13th and 16th pick in the draft and we landed Corey Kispert and Jaden Springer. I mean that'd be a fantastic first round for us. I'm more than happy with how the trade has turned out for us even though we didn't sign KD and another max FA
"But then we're talking about guys like Cade, Jaden Springer, Josh Christopher and others coming into the league. I like Lonzo but he has to add a lot more to his game (more than what guys coming into the league already have) to be an all star. Not saying it won't happen, but we'll see"

"Sorry I just woke up. Keon Johnson is a guy at the very beginning of the college season were saying was flying high under the radar until mocks started catching up. He's the type where eye test &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his superficial stats. His upside is extremely high. Let me explain the love for Keon:  1) He's arguably the best defensive SG prospect in the draft (maybe only Moody is better) and even though he's 6'5, he has a 6'8 wingspan.  2) Although his shooting splits were bad, he has a very mechanically sound jumper and college shooting is notoriously small sample size for a variable that requires a very high sample size for confidence  3) He has a really strong IQ for off-ball movement, his off-ball cutting is elite.  4) He's amazing at drawing fouls and getting to the line - 40% FT/FA rate. Combined with a tight handle, elite athleticism, and a solid FG% at the rim makes him very projectable as a guy who will be able to get to the rim in the NBA.  5) Both him and Jaden Springer are both SGs - so play finishing wasn't really overly productive at Tennessee due to a lack of playmaking  So you have a guy who is a great defender, can handle well, is great at getting to the basket whether that's through FTs or getting around his man, and the only real flaw is he shot terribly in college which ruined his production numbers, but there's nothing real mechanically wrong or shot that needs to be re-worked. Additionally, pretty much all other alternatives are equally as flawed or moreso - Scottie Barnes doesnt have a jumper, Jalen Johnson terribly underperformed in pretty much all aspects, Davion Mitchell and Bouknight are already older and behind on the NBA development curve, etc."

"Off topic, but its getting so hard for me to keep track of these younger players and prospects who have similar names. There are so many guys in recent drafts or in the upcoming drafts (especially some of the higher rated prospects) that have names like Jalen, Jaylen, Jaden, Jaren etc that I keep mixing them up. In this case there literally was a guy named Jalen McDaniels the year before Jaden McDaniels which is what caused me to go down this rabbit hole   2018: Jaren Jackson Jr, Jalen Brunson  2019: Jaylen Norwell, Jaylen Hands, Jalen McDaniels  2020: Jalen Smith, Jaden McDaniels, Jalen Harris,  2021: Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Johnson, Jaden Springer, Jared Butler  2022: Jaden Hardy, Jaden Ivey  2023-24: Jalen Duran, Jalen Washington, Jaden Bradley, Jalen Lewis, Jaylen Clark, Jayden Nicholson  Thank you for listening to my Ted Talk"

No we will prolly see guards like Green in future drafts. We could prolly draft Jaden Springer later in the draft.  But Mobley is generational.   I was on the Green train but Mobley is a franchise player. He’s ultimately the player you want if you want to win a championship.  That would mean Wood would have to be traded

"Also, I’m sad that the Celtics don’t have their first rounder this season.  I was looking forward to a pg or center of the future to be picked.  Looks like they got their center of the future.  Ngl I really wanted Jaden springer, Jared butler or sharife cooper in the draft."
"The likely scenario would probably be:  Lillard, Malik Beasley and Pat Bev to the Sixers    Simmons to Minnesota   2022 unprotected FRP (Sota)   2022 top 3 protected FRP (Sixers)   2023 Pick swap (Sota)   2024 top 5 protected FRP (Sota)   2024 top 5 protected pick (Sixers)   Tyrese Maxey   Paul Reed   Matisse Thybulle   Jaden Springer   Naz Reid    To the Blazers. Four firsts, a swap and four young talented cheap players (albeit no potential super stars).  They then trade McCollum for another good first or two decent firsts and start over."
"He's a junior, he flamed out at Kansas, and he was pretty much 3 and D in college. Didn't get to the rim a lot, didn't get a lot of FTs, etc. So he has less upside than someone like Keon Johnson or Jaden Springer, but a way higher floor too."
What time is it? Jaden Springer o' clock
1. Dennis Schroder/ minutes for Payton Pritchard is an upgrade over Kemba Walker  2. Tyrese Haliburton is better than De’aron Fox (this might not be unpopular)  3. Ben Simmons/tyrese Maxey/ Jaden Springer/ Thybulle/ 1 2022 first for Lillard makes the Blazers better in 2023 than they would be just with Lillard in that season (coming from a die hard Blazer fan)   4. Jalen Suggs has the best career in the rookie class  5. Twolves are top 6 seed in 2022 playoffs  6. Knicks miss the 2022 playoffs  7. Wizards make the playoffs  8. Detroit Pistons make the playin tourney (10 seed)  9. Hornets get top 4 playoff seed in 2022  10. Lamelo Ball makes one of the all NBA teams in 2022.  Not sure I actually believe all of these but I’m pretty sure all are somewhat unpopular and I can at least see them maybe happening.   Would love to hear which are most realistic.   Edit: fixing a couple typos
"As a Sixers fan, definitely the Sixers, but they should be fairly fun for a neutral fan. Maxey looks fully dominant and is pushing his game a little bit from last year (particularly in his 3 pt shooting), Isaiah Joe is a super fun high volume 3 pt guy who looks like an NBA rotation player, and Bball Paul is the goofy and chaotic G League MVP of last year. Interested to see how Jaden Springer plays after last game, he was great defensively but looked jittery offensively."
"Be nice my guy, I’m just thinking salary wise you’re gonna have to match it somehow. I will certainly give everything for Dame feel free to fill that different with worse salary. So throw in Jaden Springer and Seth curry as well. Tobias is ALMOST a negative asset/contract. I don’t know if you want to try to flip that piece."
"He’s 3 months younger than Jaden Springer, who played better than he did in college. 3 months ain’t worth 16 draft spots imo"
"He was excellent with Maxey last year, and I’m looking forward how he continues to do with Maxey and Jaden Springer"
"My guess is we give the new guy some burn, Jaden Springer"
"A star wanting out is pretty much inevitable.  A star wanting to go to a team that has Embiid doesn't sound too far fetched, but is the hardest part.  The last part isn't absolutely necessary if I understand you correctly.  The Sixers don't necessarily need the crazy ask met to get Beal or Lillard, as a package of Simmons, a mix of Maxey/Thybulle/Jaden Springer and multiple firsts is a pretty strong offer already.  Morey is basically saying ""I will trade a Simmons based package for a star, or I will take a trade that will create an asset based package for a star"".  He is probably gathering info on his value also so that if the hypothetical star's team doesn't want Simmons, he could work on a three way to bring in more assets for Simmons.  Obviously no guarantee it works, and I don't see anyone matching what he is asking for, but the goal is title contention and McCollum/Brogdon and a first doesn't move us any closer to that goal."
"I had literally no idea who Jaden Springer was 24 hours ago, now I’m pissed KOC only had him at 24"
Can do some Jaden chants Jerry Springer style
Jaden springer ... somebody tell me if I should be happy or not
Jaden Springer gonna be sixers point guard after Ben Simmons gets traded.
"Jaden ""Raiden"" Springer"
Garuba/Jaden Springer gonna be huge steals
"TITS, but I spent the whole week watching jaden Springer highlights for nothing."
"Kai Jones, Keon Johnson, J.T. Thor, Jaden Springer, Sharieff Cooper, Jared Butler, etc… are all still on the board. We have options"
Jaden Springer looks like a solid PG who might drop to a contender. Maybe a back up for awhile that develops into something good.
Here's my mock draft  1-Pistons-Cade Cunningham  2-Rockets-Jalen Green  3-Cavaliers-Evan Mobley  4-Raptors-Jalen Suggs  5-Magic-Scottie Barnes  6-Thunder-James Bouknight  7-Warriors-Jonathan Kuminga  8-Magic-Moses Moody  9-Kings-Franz Wagner  10-Grizzlies-Josh Giddey  11-Hornets-Jalen Johnson  12-Spurs-Alperen Sengun  13-Pacers-Davion Mitchell  14-Warriors-Chris Duarte   15-Wizards-Trey Murphy II  16-Thunder-Isaiah Jackson  17-Pelicans-Corey Kispert  18-Thunder-Keon Johnson  19-Knicks-Usman Garuba  20-Hawks-Jared Butler  21-Knicks-Ziare Williams  22-Lakers-Ayo Dosunmu   23-Rockets-Kai Jones  24-Rockets-Jaden Springer  25-Clippers-Cam Thomas  26-Nuggets-Charles Bassey  27-Nets-Day’Ron Sharpe  28-76ers-Kessler Edwards  29-Suns-Bones Hyland  30-Jazz-JT Thor
1. Cade Cunningham  2. Jalen Suggs  3. Evan Mobley  4. Franz Wagner  5. Josh Giddey  6. Jalen Green  7. Scottie Barnes  8. Jaden Springer  9. Moses Moody  10. Jalen Johnson  I biased my list towards high lotto picks that will get the most playing time and chances to succeed.
"Miles McBride, Quentin Grimes, Jaden Springer, Josh Christopher"
Star: Jalen Green   Bust: Jalen Johnson   Steal: Jaden Springer
"Tre Mann, Jaden Springer, Jalen Johnson (if he falls that far) would be good at that 24 spot."
Clippers: a center or Jaden springer
"Most noise for the Hawks is around Cam Thomas, Ayo Dosunmu and Jaden Springer in that order."
"He's had one year of good production and he shot significantly better on shots at the college 3pt line (48% on 3s inside of 24 ft) than on NBA 3s (34% beyond 24 ft). He's also not just old, he'd the be the oldest first round pick ever--he's roughly 6 years older than Jaden Springer or Josh Primo.   The question isn't if he's a good player (he is!), it's whether trading up for him is an efficient allocation of resources. Would you rather draft Ennis or have a young guard (Bones/Sharife/Tre Mann/Buter/McBride etc), another prospect (Garuba/Ziaire/JT Thor) and sign some cheap wing (Georges Niang/Torrey Craig/Sterling Brown/Langston Galloway/James Ennis)?   All those free agents will be super gettable and cheap (just like Bullock and Burks were) and they'll provide the exact same shit that Duarte would, without nearly the same level of investment"
"Jaden Springer could pretty easily go in the 20-ish range and turn into a Jimmy Butler-type. Obviously, unlikely to be as good, but in the same mold."
"Joshua Primo, Jaden Springer, Jason Preston, Aaron Henry"
I think first surprise is going to be Jaden Springer. I could see Jalen Johnson sliding.
He’ll have Jaden Springer at #5 in a few years

Josh Christopher (Utah Jazz)   I got bored at work and decided to take a stab at the first round.
"&gt;I would love for Lonzo to be S&amp;T for Schröder and probably Gasol. For Kuzma and Trez to be shipped. Caruso and THT resigned. Melo to be signed with vet min. Gorgui Dieng and someone like Dewayne Dedmon to be signed as vet mins. Then fill remaining roster with players from last year on vet mins. Oh yeah, keep the #22 pick and sign Trey Murphy III, Chris Duarte, or Jaden Springer.  So, the ""SnT Schoeder for Lonzo and fill out with good vets"" method, ala the 2020 run.  Do you think Pelicans accept that offer?"
"I don’t want Russ bc that means no depth. He isn’t bad, he’s just a bad fit for the Lakers since Lakers need 3PT shooting.   I would love for Lonzo to be S&amp;T for Schröder and probably Gasol. For Kuzma and Trez to be shipped. Caruso and THT resigned. Melo to be signed with vet min. Gorgui Dieng and someone like Dewayne Dedmon to be signed as vet mins. Then fill remaining roster with players from last year on vet mins. Oh yeah, keep the #22 pick and sign Trey Murphy III, Chris Duarte, or Jaden Springer.   Best possible scenario I can think of.  Lonzo KCP LeBron AD Dieng during regular season.   Lonzo KCP THT LeBron AD during playoffs if THT makes a huge leap."
"He's 23 years old and most of the people that got drafted around him are 19, and some like Jaden Springer and Josh Primo are even 18.   The margin of how much better you have to think he is relative to people 4 and 5 years younger than him is massive."
"Sixers are well poised for Ben to stay home.  They have Tyrese Maxey and Shake Milton competing for minutes already, and then drafted Jaden Springer.  Milton is a legit nba player, and Maxey looks to be even better.    This is a Khawi Leonard-San Antonio holdout/injury situation.  Both sided need to call it a mental health break, like Simone Biles and Naomi Osaka did.    Considering Philly's bench also includes prospects they are high on and want to showcase for potential trades, like Matisse Thybulle, Furkan Korkmaz, Bball Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe, seems to me the Sixers can win on the court and develop at the same time Ben sits out.    If any of Chicago, Portland or Minnesota gets off to a poor start while the Sixers and Embiid chug along, philly's chances of getting Lillard, Lavine, or Edwards increases.    Edwards most likely, because KAT, Malik Beasley and Dangelo Russell and Jaden McDaniels all fit around Ben Simmons  better than Edwards if the Wolves were to trade for him.  Plus, Morey built a team lat year suited for James Harden, stands to reason the next best thing would be a prospect with Harden's skillset like Anthony Edwards.  ."
"any combo of thybulle/milton/jaden springer  im also a sixers fan lol i know how good seth is. i love him, hes an incredible shooter and under rated secondary playmaker that can create his own shot against bench units  but he’s short with a slow release which makes him gun-shy very often. he also gets targeted on defense. great role player, but would be significantly upgraded by anyone thats close to all star level"
"What is wrong with these wolves fans on this subreddit lmfao. Like you are just throwing up horrific trade packages. Would you accept Shake milton, Danny green, and jaden springer for Anthony Edwards?"
Every single sixers first rounder + pick swap  Whatever young players from philly that portland wants (maxey thybulle springer etc.)  Assets from a 3rd team for ben simmons (jaden springer and 2 minnesota firsts?)
"Jaden Springer on seeing Ben Simmons’ jumper: ""Man, it looks different in person, that was obviously my first time seeing it. But watching that repetition, that exact same shot every one, I mean I sat there &amp; watched him shoot for 20 minutes, and it didn't touch the rim a lot, I can tell you that."""
"Speaking if young guys, I had legit forgotten we drafted Jaden Springer until I saw him play those garbage minutes at the end"
"Charania reported Simmons has had ""multiple verbal confrontations with teammates in practice on Sunday,"" including throwing a ball at teammate Jaden Springer after a heated exchange.  The normally laid-back Simmons is apparently showing an ""uncharacteristic level of frustration.""  He has at least four years remaining on his contract, but he has made it clear to the Sixers he wants to be traded to a contender."

Jaden Springer looks two years away from being two years away
"If OKC would agree to make the sixers 2025 1st round pick unprotected, then the sixers will have all but 1 of their draft picks. Seth Curry is on a really good contract and he would be valuable to any tanking team purely to flip for draft picks.  And maxey, thybulle, isaiah joe, are all quality young players. Even Paul Reed, Shake Milton, and Jaden Springer have a bit of trade value. Are any of them elite prospects? Hell no. Notice I said ""decent war chest of assets"". Not the best in the league. There are teams with better war chests.   Let's say dame became available in a trade. The knicks, nuggets and warriors could probably all beat the sixers best offer. But would the knicks be willing to go all in on Dame this early into their rebuild? We all know what Lacob has said about wanting to build for the future. Now maybe the warriors would go all in on dame, but it would cost a pretty penny to beat the sixers offer, and it's not clear that they would do that. And would the nuggets be willing to offer murray AND mpj? They can't even trade MPJ until next year because of the poison pill provision."
Getting absolutely lit up by Aaron Henry and Jaden Springer while yelling how they can't win without him
"- ATL: Hunter will win MIP. - BKN: Nash will find a way not to play Claxton again. - BOS: Nesmith will turn out to be a player in the mold of Covington much sooner than expected. - CHA: Plumlee will have a double double season with 4 APG. - CHI: Patrick Williams will struggle in his soph year. However, those counting him out long term will be wrong, as he'll develop in a major force after this season. - DAL: Tyler Terry will break out and play a decent role. - DEN: Zeke Nnaji will start pushing Gordon by shooting lights out. - DET: Jerami Grant will be traded before the AS game. - GSW: Poole will have at least 5 games in which he shoots 20 FG and hit under 6 of those. - HOU: Jalen Green will win ROY. - IND: Chris Duarte runner up for ROY. He'll post averages somewhere in the line of rookie Mitchell/Wade. - LAC: Will be very very disappointing. - LAK: Wayne Ellington is top 5 in 3pm this season. - MEM: Melton will, once again, play very limited minutes. - MIA: Haslem will play only a handfull of minutes but will be ejected from one game for a fight. - MIL: Grayson Allen will fill in nicely for DDV and might not give up tge starting position when DDV returns. - MIN: KAT will have a season which has him in the convo for MVP but ultimately not win due to team record. - PHI: Jaden Springer will surprise. He will become what people hoped Zhaire Smith would be, before he nearly died. - PHO: Mikal Bridges does not take that next step. - POR: Nassir Little top 5 MIP. Larry Nance 6MOY. - SAC: Haliburton and Davion Mitchell will make at least 5 starting backcourts cry this season. - SAS: Devin Vassell still will be disappointing.  - TOR: Khem Birch will average a double double. - UTA: Bojan will be traded before the AS game. - WAS: Gafford will post a pts/blk/reb triple double."
Too valuable:  Embiid Maxey Thybulle Simmons (fml)  Contract is too good: Curry Korkmaz  Upside: Basketball Paul Reed Jaden Springer  Not Harris because I don’t think anyone else would take his contract willingly. Thoughts? Other sixers fans want to tell me who I forgot? Charles Bassey?
"Eg also hyping Jaden Springer right now, so uhhhh I don’t know what you guys are thinking but I’m buying stock"
Just from this rookie class he had Alperen Sengun and Jaden Springer as his top two players in the draft
"One thing that I'm not sure enough people realize is that Poole was the 28th pick in the draft, and was asked to be the starting point guard of an NBA team missing 2 players that make up 65% of the salary cap.   He was, by many metrics, the worst player in the NBA in 2020; that's true. What if he was compared to every other year's 28th pick in the same hypothetical situation. Compared to anyone else in his situation he knocked the ball out of the park and then some, because no other player has ever been picked so far down and been asked to do so much with so little.   For comparison, the 28th pick in this year's draft is Jaden Springer on the Sixers. 13 games in with a depleted roster, he's played in one game for 2 minutes. By this time in Poole's rookie year he'd played over 300 minutes and started 8 games. Poole's grinded his way into this league through a situation most players would have fumbled much worse than he did, and the worst season in NBA history is proof of it."
"Here is the trade in question:  &gt;**Boston Celtics** receive: Karl-Anthony Towns  &gt;**Philadelphia 76ers** receive: Jaylen Brown and Patrick Beverley  &gt;**Minnesota Timberwolves** receive: Ben Simmons, Robert Williams III, Matisse Thybulle, Jaden Springer and 2022 first-round pick (from PHI)"
Only if you ignore his big board from this last draft where he has Jaden Springer #2 and touted as the next Kobe.
He said that Jaden Springer is the next Kobe.
How could you at this point lol.  That's what I've learned about our FO too. Sometimes I want a player (i.e. this draft it was Jaden Springer) but when they pick someone else I'm just like okay Tim I trust you way more than me so good pick
Dame tanking on purpose so that the blazers trade him to Philly for a second round pick &amp; Jaden springer 😮‍💨
