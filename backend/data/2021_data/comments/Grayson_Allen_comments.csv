Memphis is an easy team to root for.  Also they're extremely loaded in backcourt depth it's kind of bonkers.  PG: Ja / Tyus Jones  SG: Dillon Brooks / DeAnthony Melton / Grayson Allen  SF: Kyle Anderson / Desmond Bane / John Konchar  They basically have so many shooting guards that they're slotting the bigger ones in the wing slot. And remember they still have Justise Winslow.  I could see them consolidating their depth for another good wing in the future.
"Grayson Allen has the most similar role to Brooks and has been out the last two games, but also Dillon's defence has been top notch lately"
"I can‚Äôt tell you how much these wins mean for this team and its fans. The Spurs for years have been Grizz killers, and finally we‚Äôve begun to figure them out. But they spoil Ja‚Äôs career high 44 points in our season opener, which started off our season sour and we began 2-6. We took a five game winning streak into a two week park. Then we got SAS twice in a row to see if we got rest or got rust. Short-handed.  Injuries for Grizz: Jaren Jackson Jr, Jonas Valanciunas, Justise Winslow, Grayson Allen, Jontay Porter, Killian Tillie, Sean McDermott  Spurs: None  First game: Grizz W by 17  Second game: Grizz W by fuckin‚Äô 31  Grizz Next Gen, YOU HEAR ME?!?"
Allen Grayson would like to book a seat
&gt;Grayson Allen‚Äôs another one. All real calming personalities that just make you want to hang out with them at a country club or graduate from the same police academy together. :-)  Even white people hate Grayson Allen
Funny you never see the word ‚Äúthug‚Äù in Grayson Allen threads
*Grayson Allen has entered the chat*
Y‚Äôall treating LeBron like they did Grayson Allen his Jr/Sr year in school lmao
Well there is 5 starters and 5*30 is 150 which leaves 100 then you get your good bench players out of the way (a lot of these guys being mentioned are in my 175-200 range which is above average considering the whole league)then the next tier will get you to most average.  I‚Äôll mention some other guys I have in the same range  Josh Jackson Langston Galloway Troy Brown Jr Grayson Allen Cole Anthony Jordan McLaughlin Onyeka Okongwu Naz Reid Brad Wanamaker  Prob take Cole and Onyeka our due to potential but any of those other guys could make a case
Draymond Green and Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen looks like a Ted Cruz clone there is no other answer
Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen gotta be top 5
Unfortunately I‚Äôve already voted for a Grayson Allen/Patrick Beverley backcourt
Grayson Allen because he plays dirty and then has that dumbass smirk like he didn't do anything.
"Grayson Allen, by far, every time this comes up.  Little Ted Cruz lookin, tripping bitch."
Sounds like you‚Äôre gonna love JM regardless of what he does.   Acting out of character ‚Äúone time‚Äù can get you life in prison.   Careful with that way of reasoning around ideas you don‚Äôt like.  Also. I‚Äôll take a Grayson Allen trip over a JM upper cut to the balls 7 days a week.
"Of the hundreds of times I‚Äôve watched Jamal play since he was at UK, I‚Äôve only ever seen him use his frustrations to fuel his game. So in that sense yes, this *one time* is out of character.  But this is reddit, where you‚Äôll judge him for the *one time* he didn‚Äôt control himself, so feel free to do you. I‚Äôm not excusing him because even as a child I knew you can‚Äôt punch someone in the dick no matter how frustrated you get. But I am trying to add to the dialog since this is more nuanced than Grayson Allen tripping another player again. If you don‚Äôt want to hear it, fine I really couldn‚Äôt care less. It‚Äôs your opinion and no one cares what either of us think anyways."
The most amazing part is Murray acting shocked when he gets ejected.   Hard to support a player that will punch another dude in the nuts.   Even Grayson Allen is disappointed
everybody loves Boban  &amp;#x200B;  most people hate Grayson Allen
True. Okafor also had Grayson Allen and Tyus Jones
"I'm specifically talking about trading up to draft Brandon Clarke, Desmond Bane and Xavier Tillman, all players who were undervalued draft day but have turned into instant contributers. Esp Clarke who was All-Rookie and Bane who is shooting 45+% from 3 on 4 attempts per game when Grizz needed a shooter   As well as smart trade acquisitions such as getting De'Anthony Melton (6th man and analytics darling last year) and Josh Jackson in a salary dump from Suns and getting Igudola from Warriors then flipping him for Justise Winslow. And their trade for Mike Conley resulted in Grayson Allen, Jae Crowder (also flipped for Winslow) and two 1sts, one of whom tuned into Clarke.  People really don't understand how much work this FO has done to remake the roster into smart young players that all fit together. Yes they got very lucky with Ja and JJJ but to get to this point only 3 years removed from Grit n Grind playoff teams is incredible."
Smart‚Äôs not like Grayson Allen. If you an find video proof of a dirty play by Smart I‚Äôd love to see it. Yeah he argues but he doesn‚Äôt purposely try to hurt others that‚Äôs a crazy thing to say. He‚Äôs not like Grayson Allen.
Yeah because its not like white ass Grayson Allen is one of the most hated players in the league or something.
Grayson Allen being on this list is absolutely no surprise. Due flopped like crazy at Xavier
"Fuck Grayson Allen, haven‚Äôt liked that guy since he was at Duke. What really pushed it over the edge is what he pulled at Summer League attacking Grant Williams for setting a clean back screen. Trying to injure a guy for playing basketball. Scum."
"I don‚Äôt pretend to like Grayson Allen. You can both not like someone as a person, but understand their value to your team."
There‚Äôs a very big and clear difference between playing with fire and rage vs throwing tantrums on the court like a spoiled kid.  Lukas ‚Äúfire‚Äù has been closer to Grayson Allen than to Westbrook.
What the fuck are you trying to say? Like Grayson Allen being hated because he trips people? It‚Äôs because they have reputations for doing the things they do.
He can work together with Grayson Allen to be the most hated duo
Grayson Allen.
...... Grayson allen?
Grayson Allen MIP?
"People want to hate Grayson Allen for obvious reasons, but he is a legit NBA role player."
"Tyrus Jones, Grayson Allen, Booker, Kaminsky  And Winslow..but not really"
Has Grayson Allen been really good for Memphis?
Need a picture of MLK and Malcom X looking down and smiling from heaven at Grayson Allen
grayson fucking allen decided to be what booker shoulda been in those last two minutes. fucking infuriatinggggg
Grayson Allen played the best out of the 2015 Final 4 participants
like it or not Grayson Allen kept Memphis in the game up until the very end and played great in the final minutes. Morant was also huge in the final minutes hitting the layup and drawing the offensive foul on CP3 too
Grayson ‚Äúno OT tonight‚Äú Allen
lotta Grayson Allen
"Grayson Allen or Jimmer Fredette? One has to be your best man, who you taking?"
Grizzlies fans how do y‚Äôall feel about Grayson allen. I don‚Äôt mind him much
grayson allen looks so much like the creepy ex my senior year gf dated before me that wouldnt leave us alone and I hate it
Hard to like this Memphis team when they have Grayson Allen tbh. Love the rest of their guys.
Got locked up by Grayson Allen
Does Grayson Allen hve gray in his hair?
Grayson Allen belongs on r/13or30
"Need a picture of MLK, Malcom X and Rosa Parks looking down on Grayson Allen from heaven"
Grayson Allen three for the lead for MLK has me conflicted
Nobody believes in Grayson Allen more than Grayson Allen
I don't think I could root for my team if Grayson Allen was on it
Grayson Allen looks like my roommate who acts like a child even though he‚Äôs older than me
"I mean, you guys gave Grayson Allen a spot. So you're well on your way."
Where my Grayson Allen haters at???
He‚Äôs too casual to know who grayson allen is
Where‚Äôs Grayson Allen?
"Easily Dillon Brooks. Had like the lowest FG% and lowest PPG of anyone with 15fga last year, iirc  There was a play in the bubble against Portland where he had 3 defenders on him with like 10 sec on the shot and Grayson Allen (who shot 50% from 3 in bubble) was wide open in the corner. And he shot like a 35 fter"
"We actually shoot a lot of floaters too. Ja, Tyus Jones, Brandon Clarke, Grayson Allen, and kyle Anderson all like those little push shots. JV does a lot of post fades too avoiding contact"
Bruh i remember grizzlies fans tellin me grayson allen+ Dillon Brooks for zach üíÄ
The Grizz are 1 Grayson Allen away from being the most likable NBA team
I've played pickup against a guy who looks like Grayson Allen a couple of times. Dude was a massive asshole.
"Put all the hate aside. Grayson Allen just sucks. He's a waste of a roster spot. People look at him like he's a shooter, and when he's making them they think he's good. But even when he's making shots he's a negative in every other category. And when he's missing... fuck."
"I love the aesthetic of the Grizzlies court and jerseys.  I could do without Grayson Allen though, don't think anybody likes that dude."
Don't even think about doing some Grayson Allen-type shit tonight Grayson Allen
"Probably Grizzlies.  Ja, JJJ, Grayson Allen, Brandon Clarke, Bane, Brooks and JV. I might be forgetting someone but that‚Äôs about it lol"
"Not in order:  Scalabrine, Jeremy Lin, Pat McCaw, Luis Scola, Birdman, The Henny Man, Michael Beasley, Swaggy P, Zhu Qi, and Grayson Allen"
"&gt;Grayson Allen dropped 40 on the Jazz as a young guy too.   Yeah, when he was 4 YEARS older than Zion, against the Clippers, on 36% shooting.  This is even worse than your last attempt."
"Grayson Allen dropped 40 on the Jazz as a young guy too. Lots of young player have had higher scoring games. Zion gets buckets at the rim exclusively, a one trick pony on offense that‚Äôs easy to predict. He‚Äôs not a generational level anything until he expands his game, which I‚Äôm confident he will do."
"This comment is so dumb, get the fuck out of here. Stop hunting for racism. Boban is a freak of nature (I mean that lovingly), was in a John Wick movie, had the Boby and Toby run, seems like a fun guy, and is just generally a meme. Jokic is relatable because he doesn't look like a guy that should be averaging a triple double in the NBA, and he says funny stuff like his cookie monster comments the other night. Pat Beverly injured a superstar in a playoff game, costing the Thunder a title, is generally annoying af, flops and whines a lot, and plays dangerous/reckless, if not dirty. James Harden is a chore to watch, flops like a fish, quit on his team, and just pouted his way off the Rockets. No one gives a fucked about the skin color of any of these guys.     Here's an example of how your logic sucks ass and you're grasping at straws: ""Yeah I'm not sure if its conscious bigotry but its not a coincidence that the everyone's favourite players are guys like Tacko and Lu Dort and guys like Zaza and Grayson Allen are treated like war criminals"""
Probably someone already said it but Grayson Allen. Hate that guy. It's probable not really irrational to hate him tho
Grayson Allen dropped 40 I‚Äôm not really sure what you‚Äôre trying to say. Was he worth moving down from Hunter for? He‚Äôs also not 19.
You‚Äôre thinking of Gordon Hayward lol. I don‚Äôt think Grayson Allen is even married.
Seems extremely rational to me. If you don‚Äôt hate Grayson Allen you‚Äôre irrational and we can‚Äôt be friends.
Idk if hating Grayson Allen is irrational tbh
"Really? I feel the same way with Grayson Allen as I do with Pat Bev and he is white, not that weird that people dislike dirty players"
Grayson Allen because he looks like Ted Cruz.
Grayson Allen just oozes that Ted Cruz esque sexual energy
Grayson Allen. I cant stand his dirty playing ass and that smug I didn't do anything look on his face when he does it.
"Grayson Allen, his name pisses me off and he's a little bitch"
"Googling ‚ÄúGrayson Allen Trump‚Äù just led me to a 2016 news story that said Allen was polling ahead of Cruz and Rubio in North Carolina, which is pretty funny. I know he‚Äôs not the most well liked player to say the least but since he‚Äôs been here I‚Äôve never heard anything like that about him"
"Just the fact that Grayson Allen is a gigantic assholes, and most assholes like Trump."
Plus Harden and several others revolted against Tilman Fertitta over last summer because of his vocal support for Trump. Why expect any NBA player who isn't Grayson Allen to want to play for that?
"nah, Grayson Allen is still on the Grizzlies"
How the hell did Grayson Allen get 40?
When tf did Grayson Allen drop 40?
"The Rudy getting the league shutdown thing followed by the supposed fracture between he and Donovan could have been a funny thing to explore.  Could have Rudy been like the mountain being revived or something like that but then he's just off and turns out it gets everyone sick. Then Donovan goes full Ramsey Bolton mode during the rift and he captures Dante exum or Grayson Allen or some guy no longer on the team and ""tortures"" them. I dunno just spitballing some funny sounding shit."
"I don't care what happened last night, I'm still not convinced Grayson Allen is a rotation player."
Grizzlies undefeated this season when Grayson Allen goes for 20+
"Lmao. You could say that about lots of players tbf.   ‚ÄúOh boy, I‚Äôm watching Grayson Allen today!‚Äù  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs basketball time! Time to watch Aaron Baynes.‚Äù  ‚ÄúSacramento vs the Nuggets? Time to watch Isaiah Hartenstein do his thing.‚Äù"
Grayson Allen Finals MVP right?
Jazz did the same for Grayson Allen. Man got traded after dropping 40 /s
"Grayson Allen is a nice guy off the court, doesn't mean I have to like him on the court"
"Lol calm down man it isn‚Äôt that serious. I won‚Äôt be taking any slander from a team that backs Grayson Allen, anyways. Good day to you"
I don't know anything about the rumors but it also does not surprise me whatsoever. Look at how he plays. He complains about fouls every single time. The dude is so weak that any kind of normal contact sends him flying.  Then look at how soft his tweets are. Like the Grayson allen debacle. He just seems soft as shit. Softness on the court is almost always followed by softness off the court (ie drama queen).
Remember when Grayson Allen dropped 40 in the last game of his rookie year?

Imagine if Grayson Allen did this...
"&gt; stopping fast breaks, stopping dunks, etc.   Boy..  Booker is ON THE FLOOR and literally making someone trip over and fall on their face by grabbing his ankle..    Unbalanced fall like that can easily cause a lot of ""non-contact"" injuries, along with achilles tears and other fucked stuff.   &gt;  There's no ""devils advocate"" in this horseshit.. Booker acted like a typical middle-school shit head..  Being dirty, just because of that helpless and salty feeling  &gt;  Just imagine if this was Grayson Allen or Draymond.. instead of Booker. The internet would explode and there would be some article every day for months.. They got labelled as ""dirty players"" for literally such similar things    &gt;  Double Standards are always real.. Everyone is a hypocrite, by nature"
Grayson Allen in shambles
Any of these guys friends with Grayson Allen?

So booker is Grayson Allen with a fade amirite
JJ Redick walked so Grayson Allen could fly.
Grayson ‚ÄúTed ‚Äòzodiac killer‚Äô Crus‚Äù Allen
"Luka, Jokic and Grayson Allen."
"I wonder how it would be if you push Grayson to the bench, Dillon to the 2, and start Kyle? He's been playing great this season.  Something like Ja/Dillon/SloMo/JJJ/JV, bench would be Tyus/(Bane or Grayson, whoever's hot)/Justise/Clarke/Tillman.   Dillon, SloMo, and JJJ should provide enough spacing that we don't need Allen/Bane in the starting lineup, and that defense would be pretty good. Bench might be a little small, but I think it would work really well."
FUCK GRAYSON ALLEN
"Plumlee bro(s), Grayson allen over reddish"
Fuck grayson allen
Grayson Allen actually is dirty
I don't believe anyone even thinks about Grayson Allen.
grayson allen definitely sniffed a national championship lol
Fuck Grayson Allen
"lmao I actually love Grayson Allen. I actually don't think he was ever a dirty player, he just got victimized by some flopping ass players who cried to the media afterward. Besides honestly, they deserved it, like with Trae Young."
How tf u let Grayson Allen whoop ur ass
Why can't he be more gentlemanly like Grayson Allen smh
Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen  Dillon Brooks  Lebron  The Morris twins

Grayson Allen can fuck off
Grayson Allen
"Easy transfer to the fuck Grayson Allen line, too. Talk about convenience."
grayson allen i think
Pat Beverley and Grayson Allen are the two NBA players who straight up don't deserve to be in the league
Grayson Allen looks like a young Ted cruz
Well then let's start shaming those guys who just walk away.  I'll start!  [**Grayson Allen** embarrassingly walks away from defending Lebron dunk](https://streamable.com/hb4smr)
Yeah Grayson Allen was more justified hate but even what he got didn't match everyone's attitude towards JJ when he was in college.
"Concidentally, Grayson Allen was recently seen there as well."
"Also Herro, Duncan Robinson, Vucevic, Joe Harris, Connaughton, Redick, Grayson Allen, Bertans and Ingles."
Can you imagine if was someone like Grayson Allen doing something like that lol
AHAHAHAHAHAHAH YOU SERIOUS?  Man you fucking kings fans are soooo salty. Who the fuck else besides maybe Grayson Allen would even come close to that level of Artest. Thanks for the laugh.
Sorry.  Grayson Allen is busy with the Grizzlies stuff.
Must have learned that from Grayson Allen.

"Grayson Allen, baby!"
a great game from Grayson Allen and Jonas Valanciunas!! love those guys &lt;3
Grayson Allen has an absolutely horrid case of douche face
Yo Grayson Allen I know this is your burner
Grayson Allen would be that guy cornering you in the target parking lot wearing a suit trying to trick you into joining his pyramid scheme
"the Suns have Cam Payne and Cam Johnson the Pacers have two TJs and two Holidays Bucks have DJ Augustin and DJ Wilson Hornets have the Martin twins, Wizards have Tony Brown and Troy Brown, Mavs have Hardaway and Burke both went to Michigan,  Pels have Zion Ingram  and Redick from Duke, Bulls drafted Markkanen WCJ and Coby White 7th, Pistons have two young French players, Celtics have Jeff Teague and Jason Tatum Grizzlies have Winslow Jones and Grayson Allen from the 2015 Duke team."
How ironic that a call involving Grayson Allen was a flop with someone else doing the flopping.
"Refs need to grow some balls and start punishing players for flopping extrajudicially. Like, just flat-out tell players ""if I catch you flopping, it's open season for you for the rest of the quarter. Grayson Allen can take a machete to your ankle and I won't even put the whistle in my mouth. Good luck."""
Even Grayson fucking Allen was disgusted lol
This settles all the Grayson Allen / LeBron debates.
"&gt; he tripped over #3's foot  &gt;flop  I mean, pick one. I know people want to hate on Lebron but these are some serious mental gymnastics. ""No he actually initiated the flop a half second before he fell because his leg was wrapped around the other player.""  If Grayson Allen (#3) isn't there, Lebron doesn't fall."
He wouldn‚Äôt allow Grayson Allen to trip him
I mean its Grayson Allen standing there and Lebron James dunking. He does that shit in his sleep. Whats the deal with this?
Bad things happen on the court to Grayson Allen = me being a happy lad
"Dude is so washed! Not Bron Bron, I meant Grayson Allen"
I‚Äôm not defending the flop.   I‚Äôm pointing out that Grayson Allen is in fact a dirty player.
How is Grayson Allen an NBA player?
The only thing that would've made it better is if it hit Grayson Allen in the face.
Yeah but fuck Grayson Allen.
As they should. Fuck Grayson Allen.
"I'm just here to say fuck Grayson Allen.  Sincerely, every UNC fan living or dead"
Around Grayson Allen.
If Grayson Allen tried to contest that he‚Äôd be dead
Good business decision by Grayson Allen.
Runs around brutal thug Grayson Allen.
"I fucking hate Ted Cr- I mean Grayson Allen, he‚Äôs a bitch"
I‚Äôm surprised Grayson Allen didn‚Äôt push him afterwards
"This isn‚Äôt on Grayson, he tried to cover for his teammate who got beat.   Allen was just added on this because folks love to shit on him."

He was so fast Grayson Allen didn‚Äôt stand a chance üò≥
What did Grayson Allen do?
TIL Grayson Allen in the league
Grayson Allen is a legit NBA player and people are only gonna hate on him and wish him injuries
And better yet he did it on Grayson Allen    Fuck him.    We remember all his sins from college.
"LeBron says ""Fuck Grayson Allen, all my homies hate Grayson Allen"" and I agree"
I will go to my grave hating Grayson Allen. I will haunt his grandkids as a ghost
Grayson Allen needs to be arrested for that immediately. And during Black History Month too.
"Between this and all the Shakespeare trolls, Ted Cruz/Grayson Allen are having a rough day."
"I know we all hate Grayson Allen and this sub is flooded with Lakers fans whenever they're good, but why is this a highlight? I'm sure many other interesting plays happened tonight but an uncontested basic ass dunk is the first thing I see when coming to this sub"
"We all still hate grayson allen, right?"
I always expect the worst from Grayson Allen but this? It never occurred to me things could get this bad.
Grayson allen is cold as fuck.   made as many 3s as the lakers
grayson allen is lowkey a baller
Ironically I see this dunk on Grayson Allen right after scrolling down from seeing Ted Cruz. Thanks Reddit.
"Grayson Allen tripped him, you just can‚Äôt see it /s"
Lmao Grayson Allen had literally nothing to do here. Leave the poor boy alone.
"Grayson Allen is worse then Christian Latner, Latner never pulled this dirty shit"
Except for Grayson Allen
Fuck Grayson Allen. Pretty sure he's Ted Cruz's long lost son
Fuck Grayson Allen
TIL Grayson Allen is still in the league.
As someone who hates both lebron and Grayson Allen. This makes me feel some type of way.
Fuck Grayson Allen
Kuzma - 5 ORebs  Grizzlies - 6 ORebs  Lakers - 6/30 from 3  Grayson Allen - 6/10 from 3
grayson allen made the same amount of three pointers as the whole lakers team
Grayson Allen career game
"Now that you actually line them up like that, the Clippers truly are a team of pricks lol. All they need is Bruce Bowen, Zaza and Grayson Allen."
"Grayson Allen has kind of ""quietly"" become a pretty solid NBA player.  I wonder if he'll go the Redick route. 4 years at Duke and seen as a major villain, starts off kind of slow in the NBA, but then slowly worked his way up to becoming a really good player."
"Ja took a tough collision three games ago at the end of the game and his last two games he's been pretty passive in the first half. Still contributing his normal assist averages and playing better defense, still not good tho.  The story has been how Grayson Allen, Desmond Bane, and Deanthony Melton have been sharpshooters."
"Grayson Allen was born to late, him in the 80s was his perfect situation"
"Yeah especially with the way current lineup is playing lately, I'm not sure Memphis misses him that much. What they are playing now is basically replacing him with Grayson Allen, so a small and average guy, but it's looking good on both ends."
Grayson Allen will still be a douchebag regardless of whatever era he plays in
Not a single person likes Grayson Allen. Not even his mother who was quoted saying ‚ÄúI do not like Grayson Allen‚Äù
"Fundamentally sound ‚úÖ  Cocky, but plays with a lot of heart ‚úÖ  High motor ‚úÖ  Gets hate ‚úÖ  White guy from Duke with a punchable face and good hair ‚úÖ  Oh my god we're looking at the next Christian Laettner/Steve Wojciechowski/Danny Ferry/JJ Redick/Grayson Allen/Bobby Hurley"
The only thing legendary about Grayson Allen is how much of shithead he is.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcEq7xhxD4g
"""Dick"" Grayson Allen"
"Grayson Allen is the best, he‚Äôs actually building a time machine to go back in time and save the dinosaurs! What a guy!"
‚ÄúLovable‚Äù is the last word I would use to describe Grayson Allen lmfao dude used to try to trip people all the time at Duke and in the summer league and occasionally in the NBA.   Hasn‚Äôt been dirty much in a while but not inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt.
I can‚Äôt speak for others but I love Grayson Allen.
Am I missing something? Don‚Äôt most people hate Grayson Allen?
"i was really high on grayson allen in 2018, its great to see that he is playing nice"

I fucking hate Grayson Allen. That is all.
i‚Äôm just here to say fuck grayson allen
"Okay A:  ‚Äúa fan base that can give but not take it‚Äù  wasn‚Äôt most of yalls argument for going off on us tn was that we did it to your fanbase first?üòÇ i saw it said like 50 times lol  B: idc ab grayson allen bro, no one besides yall do, hes a good 6-7th-8thman, congrats on that  C: trae will be back, trae dropped 22 on grayson in his second nba game, bro was due for some revenge at some point lol"
Wait that makes no sense. I was told the Zodiac Killer is Ted Cruz. So that means Grayson Allen is Ted Cruz. He can't be the mother and father. Unless Ted Cruz is the son of the Zodiac Killer. Then we got some incest going on.
"Grayson Allen was 7-9 on twos tonight I've been super impressed with the off the bounce juice he's shown this season. He's mostly a shooter, but when teams try to hide guys on him (like Trae tonight) he's capable of taking advantage of his underrated length inside"
"Grayson ""Dillon ""Michael Jordan"" Brooks"" Allen"
Im just here to simp for Grayson Allen
Chad Grayson Allen
GG sucks we lost to Grayson Allen and his dirty play but if it works it works
The funniest own on r/nba and r/collegebasketball ever is that Grayson Allen turned out to be a legitimately good pro.
Grayson Allen cooking Trae Young?  Say what you want about him but he backs it up when you talk shit about him.
"I met Grayson Allen once at a charity event. I told him I enjoyed watching him play at Duke. He didn‚Äôt even look me in the eyes. He was kinda looking past me and said ‚Äúyou better pray for a closed casket funeral, otherwise I‚Äôm gonna show up and fuck the face of your dead body.‚Äù I was completely taken aback. My children, ages 10 &amp; 8 were right next to me when he said this. To this day, I will never forgive Grayson Allen."
Grayson Allen had the most rim rocking thunderous dunk i have ever laid witness to in the first quarter of this game.  Holy moly he might be a better athlete than prime lebron
Grayson Allen has changed a lot from his Duke days. Y'all can hate on him but we don't and we won't.
Man this comment aged terribly. I don‚Äôt even know where to start. Let this be a lesson about talking unnecessary shit. My favorite part is that the Grizz demolished the Hawks. My second favorite part is that you called the Grizz a dogshit team even though they have a better record than your team EVEN though they play in the west. My third favorite part is that Grayson Allen scored more than twice as much as Trae.
I love Grayson Allen almost as much as he loves dicking down the hawks
"Grayson Allen may look like the kind of guy to put his pants on one toe at a time, but he was a flamethrower this game insane"
Grayson Allen makes a three every time a Hawks fan calls him a white supremacist
Grayson Allen is a legit NBA player and I don't care who disagrees.
"Grizz have been an absolute wrecking crew against some of the top teams in the East lately. Last night and tonight were without JJJ and Winslow obviously, but also without De'Anthony Melton and Brandon Clarke, two of the Grizzlies' top pieces of the second unit. Some really impressive stretch finally to 3+ games above .500 for the first time since they were 9-6  Also Grayson Allen went absolutely bonkers tonight on top of Dillon Brooks looking fantastic and uncharacteristically unselfish"
Grayson Allen built different
"If you hate Grayson Allen, I'm the guy to Downvote.  Button's to your left &lt;---"
Hoo boy I do love me some Grayson Allen.
We are all just living in a Grayson Allen universe
Grayson Allen.
Grayson Allen breakout game
"Grayson Allen:  10/18, 3/9 from 3, for 30 points  Trae Young: 6/17, 0/4 from 3, for 14 pts.  These are just observations."
" "" Damn that must‚Äôve really really hurt. I‚Äôm sorry. I hope you‚Äôre okay "" - Grayson Allen"
fuck all the grayson allen haters
If you let Grayson Allen score on you like this you deserve to lose
Look at Grayson Allen man
Who actually likes Grayson Allen?
"Kevin Huerter, Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro, TJ McConnell, Joe Harris &amp; Grayson Allen would all like a word with you."
"People refuse to accept Grayson Allen as good lmfao. Grizz just need to say healthy, they have so much young talent. Another year of playoff contention in the west means a lot for a ""rebuild"""
Utah was able to trade Grayson Allen for Mike conley.  I'm sure GSW can figure out how to get something good for that minnesota pick + wiseman
"At least Rondo was aggressive back in his day. He was a monster on those Celtics teams, especially against Miami. Ben doesn‚Äôt play with that intensity, he tends to shy away a lot. Dude was refusing to blow by Grayson fucking Allen last night. It‚Äôs horrible."
Grayson Allen... obviously the best player on the team üêê /s
Lol your Grayson Allen flair
"CP3 Kinda had a rep like Grayson Allen coming out of college (not comparing skill sets or ability), as he had a tendency for nut shots (which also happened a couple times in the league)"
I volunteer to piss off grayson allen
"I know right! Kevin Knox, Mo Bamba, DiVincenzo, and Grayson Allen. Great stuff. Love where this league is headed."
"I don't think people hate Trae because he's black, but you have to be totally blind to not see how white players are lifted up by this sub.  Ingles, Caruso, Adams... it's not exactly a well-hidden obsession.  And to be vilified? The only a way a white player can actually become hated is by making a habit out of trying to injure players like Zaza or Grayson Allen.  All Trae had to do to become hated was have a bad haircut and be traded for Luka."
"Dude, Melton is awesome but our coach runs with Grayson Allen over him for no goddamn reason."
So put draymond on him and send Grayson Allen to double him
"Uh, Grayson Allen was a rookie when he played for the Jazz.  He also dropped 40+ against the Spurs in that Rookie year when he was with us.  We didn‚Äôt give him a ton of playing time because there were more developed players.  Rookies rarely get a lot of playing time‚Äîespecially on 40-50 win teams.  Grayson always had potential."
"Don and Jc with 48 points combined, 5 shy of the Grizz total. Fuck Grayson Allen"
"Has Grayson Allen got better since he was on the Jazz, or are Memphis in need of warm bodies? He wasn't good enough to get playing time when he was on the Jazz,  Legit question not throwing shade I've paid 0 attention to him since he left."
"For the Suns, Thomas Bryant always went off on us, although it‚Äôs been a while now. Grayson Allen usually plays well against us lately."
"right lol like the anniversary was a week or so ago, but why is this being posted now? rudy isn't hated anywhere close to a guy like, say, Russ or even Grayson Allen lol I just think people mix up a lack of interest in a player compared to how good they are and ""hate"" when it comes to public perception."
Grayson Allen plays apex
Grayson Allen
I don‚Äôt particularly care for Grayson Allen.
lol put grayson allen at the 2 and this is a solid dirty players squad
He's trash. But Everyone gets on Grayson Allen... Smart does this shit intentionally too.
"In what way was Grizzlies roster awful last year? They started Valanƒçi≈´nas, who is a double-double machine, JJJ - 7-footer who shot 40 % from three, Crowder who is a solid 3nD guy and Brooks, who had a career season that year. Plus their bench was deep aswell with the likes of Clarke, Tyus Jones, Melton, Grayson Allen and Kyle Anderson who all proved to be solid contributors in their NBA careers."
No thanks i want my Texas clubs to be pure of Grayson Allen
"I‚Äôm curious as to why you‚Äôve hated Booker since college, do you mind explaining? Personally, I‚Äôve never really hated any college players unless they just keep making bad decisions/plays (eg Grayson Allen), but most of these guys don‚Äôt make it to the NBA anyways."
"Grayson ""Rectal Seepage"" Allen"
"Grayson ""Hey Fuckface"" Allen"
Grayson Allen can relate.
Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen
This would be a top 10 all time post on this sub if it was Grayson Allen tho lmao
Grayson Allen has entered the chat.
"Okay, sure, but hear me out: Grayson Allen is literally the worst."
Lol - Grayson Allen
"Kill him ! Burn him! Oh wait, that‚Äôs not Grayson Allen."
"lol, while i know body of work plays a factor, when grayson allen does it, the sub is ready to kick him out of the nba. here is is just a chuckle and jokes."
GRAYSON ALLEN WOULD NEVER!
"James ""Grayson Allen"" Harden"
"We have a big glut of guys in that 2/3 spot. Dillon Brooks, Grayson Allen, Desmond Bane, and DeAnthony Melton are all fighting for minutes in that area. And each of them has shown that they deserve minutes.   It's one of the things this Grizz team has going for and also against it. We have a lot of good, but not great players. Ja and Jaren are our only 2 great players. The rest of the team is filled in with legitimately GOOD basketball players. But it's hard to find them all minutes. Like every team would love to have these guys, especially on their current salary, but they can only take us so far. So I'm hoping that we can either find one of these guys to be the 3rd star player, or we package a few of these guys and picks for another potentially great player.   I'm not sure how far it goes, but a package of Brandon Clarke, dealer's choice of Melton/Bane/Allen, salary filler, and 2 first round picks might be enough to get us someone else to be the dynamic wing we still need.   A starting lineup of Ja, Dillon Brooks, ""hypothetical traded for player"", JJJ, and Valanciunas/Xavier Tillman would be an excellent lineup for this team to go forward with."
I can't root for Lamelo. I can't be a fan of a bougie spoiled brat like him as a hooper regardless of how good his shot is. His personality makes you want to vomit. Him and Grayson Allen are in a league of their own in regards to fuccbois somehow making it to the NBA.
"I mean we're kicking ourselves for a lot of games. Knicks game went to OT because of missed free throws and slipped away. Lost to depleted Clippers, Magic, and Pistons while fully healthy. Mavs game lost on that insane game winner after Grayson Allen, an 86% FT shooter, missed two in a row. Bucks game lost on a buzzer beater by Jrue Holliday.  It's been a rough season, tough to keep going ""it's good experience for the young core"" when they keep getting away from us"
"Kyle Anderson, Grayson Allen, and Dillon brooks"
"But Grayson Allen is already on that corner, not giving it up without a fight"
The difference in reaction to Grayson allen and Chris Paul's antics are quite interesting.
Grayson Allen **
Yeah because r/nba sure hates Draymond right. Just like they love Grayson Allen?
"racism can happen in nonviolent instances where murder doesn't take place lol. stop trying to tell yourself that casual racism doesnt exist because it makes you feel better  telling someone to stop ""crying"" about racism really isnt effective lmao, try harder. and this deflection just continues to prove my point. so is the example of grayson allen.  &gt;ur like those morons who think the shooting of ma‚Äôkhia bryant wasn‚Äôt justified  cool assumption. ill go ahead and say you're one of the guys who thinks white privilege isnt real"
"Look I‚Äôm a Mavs fan so I‚Äôm obviously biased but the people acting like they‚Äôre heroes for criticizing or talking shit about Luka are just as annoying as Lukastans. I get this sub is way more pro Luka than anti but you‚Äôre not a martyr for hating the guy lol.  Also that whole race comment chain is ridiculous. People hate on Zaza and Grayson Allen just as hard as they do Draymond. I swear the overwhelming white redditors here think they‚Äôre being anti racist when they‚Äôre doing way more harm than good. It‚Äôs patronizing and lazy. Yes, there is absolutely a white bias for Luka just like there has been for other white stars because people identify which other people that look like them. However, completely ignoring player reputations and history to show what a gosh darn ally you are is what actual racists point to to ignore the problems POC face every day."
Why don't you compare apples to apples like draymond and Kelly olynick or Grayson allen. Guys who have done multiple dirty plays. I dont see anyone defending those guys.
Unless you‚Äôre Grayson Allen
I love Luka as much as the next guy but sheesh if that was Grayson Allen or P Bev this sub would've been saying to ban the dude
Probably because Luka is such a classy guy and doesn't play thugish basketball like Beverly or Grayson Allen therefore doesn't deserve to be tossed.
"Don't overanalyze this shit lol, mfs finally became hyperaware of race in 2020 and haven't looked back since. Tryna find a microagression in everything just dilutes the conversation for when it's actually pertinent.   You think Grayson Allen would get the same reaction from this play?"
Luka the next Grayson Allen smh
Grayson Allen
Yo this is crazy but Memphis legit misses Grayson Allen
Bold to assume the Lakers survive Grayson Allen in the play-in
How is stepping on someone‚Äôs foot soft stuff?   A pot of the cross over where people get dropped are because they get their foot stepped on.   It‚Äôs not a foul. But I don‚Äôt Think they should count as dropping someone.   It‚Äôs akin to tripping someone. But Grayson Allen is hated for it
"You're missing the Grizzlies, honestly.  They have a star point guard and very capable back-up PG in Morant and Tyus Jones.  As an OKC-Jazz fan, I envy their options at SG: two-way menace Dillon Brooks, sharpshooter Grayson Allen, advanced stats darling and defensive ace DeAnthony Melton, flamethrower-type of shooter Desmond Bane and John Konchar who is a lot better than people realize since he's buried down the depth chart (he could be a reliable regular back-up on some teams).  At small forward, they have options due to Justise Winslow (who's in a slump) and Kyle Anderson. But this is the only position where they could use more strength, even though Brooks, Konchar and Bane could play the position in a small-ball lineup.  Big man/PF rotation is something to envy: one of the most underrated centers in Valanciunas, potential star JJJ, Tillman, Clarke, even Jontay Porter is somewhat interesting as a prospect (would looove to have him on Jazz or OKC).  Honestly, hats off to their GM."
"I don't get why r/nba was so adamant against admitting it was a reckless play. Not that Hill is dirty because of that play, but it was reckless.   Hill realized LeBron was falling forward and trying to land, so leaned his body in order to fall into LeBron's landing spot. NBA players are aware of where they are on the court and usually don't injure guys like that  There have been far less reckless plays that r/nba railed against and those players, like Grayson Allen tripping Trae with just his foot, which sent this sub into a frenzy."
"Nah, from what I've seen, the Grayson Allen hate knows no bounds. Definitely hated more than Pat Bev.  And just because your life is affected by racism doesn't mean you have to see it in everything."
"Dude have you ever heard of Pat Bev? He is literally a better version of Allen, but he‚Äôs black and he catches shit on this sub constantly...so, yes I think if Grayson was black he would catch more shit.   Just because your life isn‚Äôt affected by racism doesn‚Äôt mean that that‚Äôs how it is across the board."
"We have an incredibly deep group of good players. Players that everyone would be happy to have on their team. JV, Slo-Mo, Brooks, Jones, Melton, Bane, Clarke, Tillman, even Grayson Allen. They are all GOOD, legitimate NBA players.   Our bench is one of the most productive in the league because we have so many of these good, not great, players. So when other teams start dipping into their 8th/9th man rotations, we are able to exploit that.   Our biggest problem going forward is that we have all of these B players and really only two A players in Morant and JJJ. If we can find some way to package up a few of them for an A player, our ceiling goes so much higher."
Just imagine if Grayson Allen had done that. There would be pitchforks galore
I have never seen anyone say something positive about Grayson Allen.
Grayson Allen will do something
It‚Äôs between Pat Bev and Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen I'd assume is somewhere here.
"I disagree. This community shouldn't be a good look. It's reputation should be awful. He needs to go to an AMA site, not this amazing, awesome pile of garbage sub.  It should be risky to dip your toe here. It's fun. Remember when Grayson Allen came on?   Man should address that spanking video lol. It's Ask Me Anything, after all."
"Players like Grayson Allen, Pat Bev, should've been banned a long time ago."
"It‚Äôs just kind of fallen that way lol. On top of that I have Darius Garland and Payton Pritchard at point. Grayson Allen as my backup 2 and my weakest point is Center where I have a cast of Mo Wagner, Jarred Vanderbuilt and Jalen Smith"
"Grayson Allen is arguably more average looking, and Kenyon Martin Jr is the most average looking NBA player ever"
Imagine having a Grayson Allen flair and calling someone else a prick
Extend Grayson Allen and start him at the 2.
"&gt; hit Grant Williams in the NBA  Actually he hit Grant Williams in FUCKING SUMMER LEAGUE  There were two flagrant fouls that entire Summer League season, and they were both commited by Grayson Allen in a 90 second span"
Grayson Allen.
"I think the stats guys did numbers on this, the numbers clearly show that Grayson Allen is still lame af"
Grayson Allen is a bully
Grayson Allen has tripped dudes in the nba too
 &gt;It‚Äôs a good thing Grayson Allen is the next coming of Klay. Great player and a greater man. He was just misunderstood and a fiery competitor at Duke.  Wut?
Grayson Allen lmfao
"yep, i think the same thing about grayson allen."
Y‚Äôall can keep Ja Morant. Let me know when Grayson Allen makes another sweet play.
Grayson Allen really came crashing back down to earth yeesh.
Grayson Allen.   For opposing teams and the Grizzlies
"With popular players, the only right answer is PG. For more niche players, its either Grayson Allen or Pat Bev."
"It feels like it's got to be KD or Kyrie, amongst players though it might be somebody like Patrick Beverley or Grayson Allen"
Harden Trae  Beverly  PG Draymond  Grayson Allen  No particular order
Grayson Allen and it's not particularly close
"""Dirty"" becomes more of a matter of opinion, and I believe his intent (based in frustration as a result of the good defense and steal) was to stop Giannis. In a moment of that frustration, he reacted emotionally by briefly sweeping his foot in a very clear tripping motion, that of which is EASILY comparable to the largest offender commonly known, Grayson Allen.  Did PJ Washington react poorly out of pure frustration?  It really seems that way.   Does that make PJ Washington a ""dirty"" player?  Certainly not.   However, if he continues to do things like that, he will become known as a ""dirty"" player, because the motion of his foot is clear to fans of other teams not emotionally involved in this game or these teams whatsoever."
Grayson Allen watching that game and thinking why didn't I come up with the leg sweep first.
Grayson Allen for obvious reasons
LOL Grayson Allen being mentioned. Fuck that fucking douche
Big Duke fan eh?  Tell us your feelings on Grayson Allen:
lol. the driveby on Grayson Allen lmao
"You're 100% right, and imo, everyone coming to Boban's defence is doing so solely because it's Boban. If Grayson Allen or Zaza did that people would be fine with it. But intent/maliciousness doesn't play a factor in flagrants"
"Zaza isn‚Äôt even the best undercutter, that‚Äôs the Bruce Bowen special. Nobody trips people up like Grayson Allen, he‚Äôs in a league of his own."
Uh uh Grayson Allen huhuh w-w-where are y-wh-uhuhuh he twi- a Grayson Allen int-i-imitation
Yes fuck Grayson Allen
"Caruso, Poku, Grayson Allen, Nico Mannion, Luka"
"lol the announcer was like ""I know there's a Grayson Allen joke to be made here, so I'm just going to say his name since I can't fully formulate one right now"""
I‚Äôm loving that Grayson Allen has become synonymous with this bullshit.  Fuck Grayson Allen.

Him and Grayson Allen are the least likeable guys in the league
And Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen.
"&gt;His antics in college were less than ideal, but I think he was just doing it out of frustration.   &gt;   &gt;It just shows his competitive nature.  You say that like it's unique to Grayson Allen. No one just accidentally ends up in the NBA. They're all competitive people and the difference is if someone is KG insane levels of competitive or more run-of-the-mill normal person competitive. Same for getting frustrated. I get frustrated with my 3-year old, but I don't sweep her legs and then pout in a folding chair afterwards.   Is Grayson Allen good enough to be a role player in the NBA? Absolutely, and that's to be applauded because he's in the top fraction of the top 1% of all basketball players in the world. Do I want to cheer for him? No, not at all."

"Your contract situation is bomb, I believe you can extend JJJ and JV/Anderson/Winslow (maybe 2 of them), next season, and the rest of the players are team options, have atleast 3 years, or are young and aren‚Äôt making much.  I say keep Anderson and Grayson Allen, JV‚Äôs value is always growing so he could be good trade bait for younger assets, and Brooks is a great asset"
The nuggets game sucked cuz we blew a 12 pt lead w 3 minutes left and the Luka shot hurts even more cuz Grayson Allen couldve put the game away with two free throws but missed both. OKC one fucking sucked cuz i remember watching it and also hearing that the new Attack on Titan episode wasnt coming out.
"Grayson Allen (and dare I say Taylor Jenkins?) tried their damnedest to lose this game, but Dillon Brooks was like: ""Nah."""
The 7 point loss is flattering to the Blazers. It took a Melo hot streak and Grayson Allen bricking everything to even make it close. And this wasn't even Grizz at their best.
Grayson Allen really tried to throw the game lmao!
Grayson Allen almost lost Memphis the game...
Grayson Allen was so awful in the fourth. The entire Blazers run was facilitated by 4-5 straight possessions with Allen clanking threes
Grayson Allen and Dillon Brooks needa be traded no cap lmao
Bro what the hell was Grayson Allen thinking with that foul? The game went from a two possession game to a one possession game because of that stupid ass foul on Nurkic
"Get Grayson Allen out of the game, he‚Äôs a liability"
Probably learned that during the off-season hanging out with fellow dookie Grayson Allen.
Grayson Allen would lead the Griz to the finals every year!!!!
Joe Harris went from Klay Thompson to Grayson Allen real quick when he was asked to be the 3rd option
Yes.  Wardell Stephen Curry  Also a Grizzlies fan / Grayson Allen stan
"Correct me if there‚Äôs a problem with this lineup but I‚Äôd like to see Melton start alongside Ja instead of Grayson Allen and then let Winslow run the offense in the second unit. Winslow played the best basketball of his career when he played point guard for Miami and I‚Äôd like to see him in that role more, providing he can stay healthy."
Y‚Äôall forgot Grayson Allen is in the league and gets meaningful playtime just because he isn‚Äôt guarding all stars in Memphis.
"You'd like all your players to be the best versions they  can be. Some guys, like a Grayson Allen or JJ Reddick top out at quality role players. Trevor Arizas, or Robert Covington types.   The thing that is frustrating with Ben Simmons is he has all the intangibles to be LeBron 2.0. He's 6'10""/11"", can guard 1-5 at DPOY level, has a great handle and passing vision seen only in top tier point guards, his size is an instant mismatch and if he put in the work and matched it with the mentality, he'd be a Mount Rushmore player.   It's not giving heat or being salty, it's almost bitter disappointment that we're witnessing one of the greats not be...great"
Bogi is who Grayson Allen thinks he is
"Bullshit lol. If Grayson Allen did this the sub would be at his throat. If Mike Conley or Jrue Holiday did this, there‚Äôd likely be a similar reaction to Jokic, with the majority questioning if it was truly worthy of an ejection. It‚Äôs about reputation and the history of a particular player, but I guess that doesn‚Äôt sound as profound as writing it off as a symptom of grand societal racism. Maybe you could argue that subtle racism can influence a player‚Äôs reputation and you might have a point, but pretending this sub thinks white player commits an intentional foul=clean and black player commits an intentional foul=dirty is pretty laughable."
"Cam Payne.  Luke kennard. Saric.  Grayson Allen.    Campazzo. Austin rivers.   I haven't watched much eastern ball but maybe bruce brown, shamet, blake Griffin"
Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen plays for the Grizzlies though
Blake Griffin is like the big man version of Grayson Allen these days
Is Grayson Allen a joke to you?
Grayson Allen   Tripping ass bitch
Grayson Allen.   Dude does a lot of things well. I think hes a solid backup SG.  If you ignore his college career. . .
LeBron James and Grayson Allen
"This whole thread just to put respect on Graysons name.   ""Name your top 4 players and Grayson allen and you have a solid top 5"""
Grayson Allen?
Grayson Allen for obvious reasons
Bruh there are actual Grayson Allen fans
Simmons  Harden  Pg  KD  Draymond  Jimmy  Westbrook  Kyrie  Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen?
The Nokia Ben Simmons Award for 2021 goes to Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen*
Hey man you have the comment history fantasizing about Grayson Allen.
"Hey it‚Äôs this shithole who claims to be a warriors fan, but has never posted a single positive statement about the Warriors or ever even been to r/warriors!   Also they hate James Wiseman and has Grayson Allen‚Äôs dick very very deep down their throat. So this person is either Grayson Allen or Grayson Allen doppelg√§nger Ted Cruz."
bro every single post youve made (including ones ive commented on) talks about grayson allen. i know its you grayson
Grayson Allen would have been stomped in the 90s lmao they wouldn't fuck with his antics
Grayson Allen would get punked in the 90s. People retaliated more often then.
Grayson Allen leg sweep
"It'll be hard to pass 1984, but early returns say 2018 is already making a case to be the best draft ever. Ayton, Luka, Trae, MPJ could be equivalent to Hakeem, MJ, Stockton, and Barkley when it's all said and done.  Admittedly, passing those top 4 will be EXTREMELY tough to do by any metric, but aside from the star power, 1984 wasn't that deep, and 2018 is.  Alvin Robertson, Kevin Willis, and Otis Thorpe were the only other all-stars in 1984, but 2018 also has SGA, Mikal Bridges, Sexton, JJJ, Mitchell Robinson, DiVincenzo, Devonte Graham, Okogie, Grayson Allen, Anfernee Simons, TimeLord, Shamet, Brunson, Bruce Brown, and Huerter. Even Bagley too.  Now obviously not all of those guys will be all-stars, or even close, but if when it's all said and done and the 2018 core 4 end up close to 84, there will be WAY more overall production and amount of quality players from 2018.  To be in year 3 and already have 24 quality NBA players from one draft is just bonkers."
PG: Kyrie  SG: Grayson Allen SF: Grant Hill PF: Zion Williamson C: Christian Laettner
Was going to pick the Warriors until I saw that the Heat also get Grayson Allen. Way to bury the lede.
"&gt; Luka Doncic is r/NBA‚Äôs golden boy. He can do no wrong. He takes 7 inefficient step-back threes a game, stat pads triple doubles, shoots tons of free throws and yells about foul calls. To r/NBA this makes him ‚Äúa stud‚Äù and ‚Äúbuilt different.‚Äù They love him unconditionally. Meanwhile, James Harden plays this same style of basketball. Everything I just said to describe Luka‚Äôs play could be said about Harden equally. They must love him too, then‚Ä¶ right? If you‚Äôre familiar with nbacirclejerk (which I assume you are if you‚Äôre reading this) then you might have an idea of what‚Äôs coming here. In my research I found a few recent (within the year) instances of r/NBA users claiming the Rockets could only beat teams using the refs. Going further back into the sub, there‚Äôs lots of people in game threads, post game threads, etc. calling Harden a ‚Äúflopper‚Äù a ‚Äúchucker‚Äù a ‚Äúbitch‚Äù and a ‚Äúchoker.‚Äù I even found two comments that said ‚ÄúI hate [Harden] as a person.‚Äù (It‚Äôs odd to me how r/NBA seems to assume they know players on a personal level, but that‚Äôs a topic I‚Äôve covered in previous posts.) Harden clearly gets different treatment from r/NBA than Doncic, despite the two of them playing eerily similar ways, and acting relatively the same in regards to foul calls. So what‚Äôs different between the two of them to cause this? Is it the team they play for? The Rockets don‚Äôt seem to be particularly well liked, but the Mavericks do recently. So that‚Äôs it, problem solved right? No. As one person in r/NBA puts it, ‚Äúthe Mavs didn‚Äôt have this many fans when Harrison Barnes was their best player.‚Äù r/NBA doesn‚Äôt have any deep spiritual connection with the Mavericks that causes them to love all their players. So why is Doncic so loved and Harden so hated? **Well, to be quite frank, Doncic is white**. It has to be said that r/NBA loves white players. The only example of a caucasian player being disliked in r/NBA that I could find in my research was Grayson Allen. People love players like Alex Caruso, and say he‚Äôs a top 20 shooting guard in the league, while his teammates who are also shooting guards are ignored or hated, like Avery Bradley and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope respectively. I would rank both of those players above Caruso in terms of talent and impact for the Lakers, but only one of those three players is given universal praise on r/NBA."
Add Grayson Allen to slytherin.
He‚Äôs better than Grayson Allen
"Ah, I see what you meant. I just got confused because neither Paul brother or Grayson Allen is particularly likeable so I didn't like seeing Greinke mentioned among that company lol."
Banish both of those Paul twats to the shadow realm. They‚Äôve topped Grayson Allen and Zach greinke for most punchable faces
Grayson the other Allen takes KD's lunch
Imagine if they get rising star Grayson Allen lmao. I am whelmed af
"yeah.  they should sign actual good players like grayson allen, jonas valuncunas, joe harris, or kyle korver out of retirement.  &amp;#x200B;  white good"
JJJ &amp; Grayson Allen too
"Grizzlies don't have a 3 level scoring guard like CJ. Something like Slowmo, Grayson Allen/ Melton, and Justise Winslow might be it. Blazers get deeper, more versatile and better defensively."
"2018 has just some solid ass players all around whether they in the playoffs or not right now:  Ayton, Doncic, Jackson Jr., Trae, Sexton, Mikal Bridges, SGA, Miles Bridges, MPJ, Divencenzo, Huerter, Lonnie Walker, Shamet, Gary Trent Jr., Anfernee Simons, Jalen Brunson, Grayson Allen. A lot of quality picks."
"&gt;  Bro what, so I'm a bandwagon now cause I hate Jae Crowder? Hes been one of the most dirty players in the league since 2017.   Grayson Allen has entered the chat..."
Hot take‚Ä¶ Grayson Allen is a better player than Kuzma.  Dude might not see a starting role outside of injuries for the rest of his career.
No one cares about the stupid janitor thing lmao. And Grayson Allen does way more actually dirty shit than Pat. Pat talks shit and plays hard but because he isn't the correct race he gets absolutely blasted by r/nba
"What kind of response does it deserve? ""People only hate Pat Beverely cause he's black :("" like no? It's cause he's a dirty player, and constantly does shit people dislike like harassing a freaking janitor about how ""We run this league now"" and other stupid shit like that. He's literally a Grayson Allen type of player. That's why people dislike him."
"kill donovan, fuck clarkson because you know that'd be fun, then marry mike conley cause wholesome.     Kill grayson allen, hate fuck brooks then dump him as rudely as possible, marry ja morant because I wanna be part of his awesome family."
"kill fuck marry  Jazz - Mike Conley, Donovan , Clarkson  Grizz - Ja Morant, Dillon Brooks, Grayson Allen"
Royce looked like he was going to kill Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen can‚Äôt hang with JC
This isn‚Äôt my first time watching the playoffs lol. Teams don‚Äôt typically get away with several elbows and punches to the face in this era. Don‚Äôt act like what your team is doing is normal. You even have Noel throwing out his leg to trip Trae lmao. I mean who does that other than Grayson Allen?
"Pritchard, Grayson Allen, Tatum, Meyers Leonard, and Kelly Olynyk"
Imagine if Grayson Allen went to Boston to play for Coach K again lmao
" Along with Joe Harris, Frank Kaminsky, Grayson Allen, TJ McConnell, Duncan Robinson, Joe Ingles, Tyler Herro, Myles Leonard, Cody Zeller, Gordon Hayward. LOVE those guys. First team all class."
Kevin Love Tyler Herro Duncan Robinson Gordon Hayward Grayson Allen
ok the grayson allen bit was at least a little funny this time. you're getting better at this
last night grayson allen got called for a block on a similar play where mitchell pushed off and then fell
I‚Äôm surprised more people aren‚Äôt alarmed by your Grayson Allen comment. Eff that guy
"&gt;Grayson Allen will win Game 5 for the Grizzlies tomorrow night, book it  Conley will not let this happen as he swishes a dagger 3 to slit the throat of the pesky Grizzlies"
More than Grayson Allen though?
"The 36 thing is fair, but in my eyes our biggest need is a starting point guard and if you can go from Elfrid Payton to a first ballot hall of famer then it‚Äôs pretty tough not to. And every team in NBA history has had dirty players. Not ideal but it‚Äôs part of the game. CP3 is much more benign than a Grayson Allen and company"
"Because A. He just turned 36 and B. I'm not particularly fond of dirty players. I also don't want Draymond, Grayson Allen, Jae Crowder, or Zaza."
A guy on /r/basketballcards collects Grayson Allen cards.
A huge reason why people hate Grayson Allen is because he looks like Ted Cruz.
Does anyone care or talk about Grayson Allen anymore?  Seems more like obsessive Duke haters who can‚Äôt ever let anything go.
"Taylor Jenkins is a really good coach. The young role players in Bane, Tillman, and even Grayson Allen are also making great contributions which is a big part of the reason why this team is better record-wise than last year even with JJJ injured and inconsistent since his return."
"Definitely not the sort of foul I was expecting when I read Grayson Allen and ""controversial"" in the same sentence."
"Grayson Allen is the only active player where I'm totally cool with it. Hell, give him a flagrant 2 for all I care, the man deserves a shovelslap storm from an octopus."
"On a side note,  pleasantly surprised about how good Grayson Allen is in the NBA.  He‚Äôs going to have a 10 plus year NBA career."
[he was dirty af at duke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcEq7xhxD4g)  [and i think he was the first player ever ejected from summer league after being called for two flagrants within 8 seconds](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/grizzlies/2019/07/12/grayson-allen-ejected-summer-league-grizzlies/1712566001/)
Grayson Allen literally closed fist punched at the ball and hit him like 3 times... Trying to foul.
This is to many Grayson Allen highlights
"Melton, Grayson Allen, Bane  Idk what we do going forward with them. One of them will have to be traded and it will be a sad day üò™"
I don't care for Grayson Allen but that was a bullshit call.
"Nobody except Duke fans expected Grayson Allen to be THIS good in the NBA, what a stud"
Yikes getting blocked by Grayson Allen üò¨
Am I rooting for Grayson Allen? What have I become
I'd fuck Grayson Allen up.
"I love mike Conley but the pieces involved in getting him (jae crowder, Grayson Allen, two late firsts) all worked out and are still good/development pieces.   Happy to see success with these guys"
Why did TNT show me a damned Grayson Allen layup replay instead of the foul
Pretty sure you‚Äôre thinking of Grayson Allen
Donovan sees Grayson Allen guarding him and gets a chubby.
Grayson Allen is a bonafide scrub
"looking at your post history, all you talk about is Grayson ""physical klay jr"" allen"
Sad day for the caucasoids when the only good white players anyone can name are Larry Bird... and JJ Redick. Quite the fall off! With a little hard work maybe Grayson Allen can be the next to join this list.
"Definitely true, but he is Grayson Allen."
"Grayson Allen hasn't acted like his college days, can we say he's somewhat reformed?"
"I get why people disliked Grayson Allen at duke because of his dirty play and tripping, but your still going to hold it against him in the pros? If he hasn‚Äôt done it in the pros then I think he should get a clean slate until proven otherwise."
What did Grayson Allen do to be hated
Grayson Allen fucking around and becoming a real solid role player
"You really can‚Äôt spell Grayson Allen withour Ray Allen.  Grayson can be like Ray.  BACK TO ALLEN, HIS 3, ITS GOOD!"
Where were you when Grayson Allen became possessed by Klay Thompson
I WANT MY DAMN RESPECT  - GRAYSON ‚ÄúPHYSICAL KLAY JR‚Äù ALLEN
GRAYSON PHYSICAL KLAY JR ALLEN
Fuck grayson allen but he‚Äôs a really good man to man defender
Grayson Allen and Bane for Wiseman. What say you Memphis fans?
What a scumbag that Grayson Allen.  You love to see it.
I ‚ù§ Grayson Allen even if he went to Duke.
"https://www.nbadraft.net/2018-nba-draft-combine-measurements/   https://www.nbadraft.net/2019-nba-draft-combine-measurements/  Oh wow, look at all those percentages in the 4-6% range from the 2018 NBA COMBINE.  Oh, and the 2019 Combine.  Wow.  Bruce Brown 3.75  Grayson Allen 5.5  Kostas Antetok~~~ 5.0  Shai Gilchrist Alexander - 3.0  Landry Shamat 4.8  Nic Claxton 4.5  Cam Reddish 4.7  &gt;**Tako Fall 6.8**  Trae Young 5.4"
"Crowder and Grayson Allen have done that.(tripping players or grabbing their legs so they fall) draymond literally kicked a dude in the groin on multiple occasions. Wade has shoved other players to a near serious injury. Bev is reckless and stupid, but I wouldn‚Äôt say he‚Äôs dirty."
Grayson Allen hasn‚Äôt been that bad
Imagine what people would say if this were Grayson Allen.
"Absolutely sickening how this sub voted Chris Paul,  Patrick Beverley, and Grayson Allen to the NBA all non-dirty team."
"I wonder if Pat Bev, cp3, Draymond, and Grayson Allen teamed up and won it all, would they be hated or does winning really cure everything?"
The trip on him by Jones was incidental. Him reaching out to trip KCP was obviously on purpose.   If you don't think that's dirty then I hope you've never said a word about Grayson Allen being dirty.
Grayson Allen joining Team USA will be quite something.
"All-hated team should also have: Marcus Morris, Pat Bev, Rudy Gobert, Grayson Allen, Ben Simmons, Andre Drummond, Jae Crowder, Kyle Kuzma  All-loved team should have: Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, Derrick Rose, Alex Caruso, Jarrett Allen, Boban Marjanovic"
Give the people what they want-give us Grayson Allen!
Grayson Allen. Hasn‚Äôt he punched more than one dick?
"*Kyrie Irving will win MVP*  Not really seeing it but because the MVP can be a popularity contest, who knows - maybe Kyrie hires a great promotional firm and can keep fooling people into thinking he's on the same level as Harden and KD.      *CJ McCollum will be an MVP candidate if he gets moved*  Has there ever been a player that's never made an all-star team and gets mentioned as an MVP candidate?      *Russ or Beal will not be wearing a Wizards uniform by the trade deadline*  I could see it      *Kyle Kuzma becomes a legit 3rd option in another team*  Is it a good team? I could see him playing well on a team like the Warriors or Nuggets where they've got some players already. But I don't know about 3rd option.      *Brandon Ingram will be in a Warriors uniform*  You've got me torn on this one. The scoring and the size would be nice but I'm not sure how they could convince NoLa to part with him. I like Wiggins but he doesn't really move the needle.      *Grayson Allen will be an All Star*  Well, it's always good to end with something memorable - like a punchline."
Grayson Allen being an All star and Ingram going to the Warriors are even more implausable. I appreciate bold predictions that are actually bold for once though.
OP please delete your account no one likes Grayson Allen
"Okay, so an unproven young player (Grayson Allen), a rotation wing (Jae Crowder), filler (Kyle Korver) and 2 first round picks (#23 in 2019 + the protected 2020 pick). From my understanding the ask for Lowry was Maxey and/or Thybulle (young player/s), Danny Green (rotation wing), Mike Scott (filler) and potentially 2 first round picks (both of which would most likely be in the late, late 20s). Okay, so the ask for Lowry included one extra asset, and I understand valuing Thybulle (not Maxey) very highly, but consider that it would have been a trade to a division rival and direct competitor (which is never discussed), Lowry has a way better resume than Conley, and both teams knew that the 76ers' guard play was their weakest link.  The Gasol trade didn't involve any first round picks but did involve JV, who was one of the team's main centers, and Delon Wright, who was also an important rotation player. The commonality is that it required parting with important rotation and depth pieces to shore up a glaring weakness in the roster.  Did it guarantee anything? Of course not. Gasol could've broken his pinky toe a week before the playoffs and it would've been a disaster. But when you have a guy like Embiid playing the best basketball of his life and you know his clock is ticking, you have to maximize your team's championship window and Morey failed to do that."
Are you conflating him with Grayson Allen? Because I feel like Allen was really hated. But he‚Äôs getting better.   Best thing Reddick has done is stick around and get players to talk on his podcast. I still had some respect for him in college because he would play EA college (whatever it was called) online with Adam Morrison. Now people really hated him.
"Grayson Allen, probably some combination of Tyus Jones/Kyle Anderson/Jonas Valanciunas/Deanthony Melton and one first round pick as needed. We have way too much depth and need to shorten our rotation"
Did so good he missed the playoffs and got sent home by Grayson Allen.
"I've never understood how a guy who is such a respected leader off the court can behave like such a petulant child for his entire 16 year career on the court and still be viewed as such a people's champ.  Fans detest guys like Pat Bev, Grayson Allen etc and yet CP3 has been doing the same stuff for nearly 2 decades and he's beloved."
"I always acknowledge that Chris Paul is so fuckin good, his talent / BBIQ / touch is off the charts, but he is so fucking annoying. He's possibly the most annoying player I've ever seen, except maybe Grayson Allen. Dude is just completely shameless out there when it comes to sketchy shit like this."
Idk just spitballing but:  Luka Doncic  Dirk Nowitzki  Brian Scalabrine  Tyler Herro  Alex Caruso  Duncan Robinson  Larry Bird  John Stockton  Bob Cousy  Bob Pettit  Mark Eaton  John Havlicek  Mike Bibby  Maxi Kleber  Jordan Farmar  Zach Collins  Jusuf Nurkic  Nikola Jokic  Frank Kaminsky  Dario Saric  Joe Ingles  Bogdan Bogdanovic  Bojan Bogdanovic  Klay Thompson  Alen Smailagic  Svi Mykhailuk  David Lee  Arvydas Sabonis  Domantas Sabonis  Pau Gasol  Marc Gasol  Luke Kennard  Dragan Bender  Alex Len  Ricky Rubio  Cole Aldrich  Cedi Osman  Mike Dunleavy  Mike Miller  Bill Laimbeer  Tommy Heinsohn  Kelly Olynyk  Kevin Love  Ryan Anderson  Grayson Allen  Zydrunas Ilgauskas  Nikola Vucevic  Mario Hezonja  Boban Marjanovic  Davis Bertans  Gordon Hayward  Matt Thomas  Chase Budinger  Steve Kerr  Luc Longley  Jeff Hornacek  Brian Cardinal  Chris Kaman  Steve Blake  Tomas Satoransky  Jakob Poeltl  Manu Ginobili  Luke Babbitt  Kevin Huerter  JJ Barea  Dan Majerle  Tom Chambers  Tyler Zeller  Cody Zeller  Mason Plumlee  Tyler Hansbrough  Sam Merrill  Nico Mannion  Peja Stojakovic  Pete Maravich  Those are just my top 75 idk they all have something about them that makes them great
"Man idk, I was at a 4th BBQ a couple days ago and some of my buddies said they‚Äôd trade Ben Simmons for Grayson Allen straight up. That was the very best offer they said they‚Äôd take and we‚Äôre unironically saying he should play in the G League or China. The recency bias is very real."
Hopefully one day Ja will become the insane athlete Grayson Allen is
Ah yes. Classy XnO coach Grayson Allen would shid on Thugs like dwayne casey
I would fuck Grayson Allen if it wasn‚Äôt gay
"Grayson Allen is the next Phil Jackson, wtf are you smoking mate?"
"Tyler Herro, Joe Harris, Kevin Huerter, Gordon Hayward, Kevin Love  TJ McConnell, Luke Kennard, Duncan Robinson, Dean Wade, Mason Plumlee  Alex Caruso, Grayson Allen, Garrison Matthews, Pat Connaughton, Cody Zeller"
I know for a fact that at least Grayson Allen and Frank Kaminsky use r/nba frequently. Daryl Morey comments on the sixers sub from time to time
God damn man next your gonna try to tell me you don‚Äôt like Grayson Allen
The ol Grayson Allen special
"Between picks 21-30 seems like you have maybe a 35% chance on hitting at least a rotation player, and then maybe 10-15% on getting a really legitimate piece.   1/3 might not seem super high, but that‚Äôs also at a very low salary that you have a ton of control over.   **2011**  Mirotic (23rd)  Reggie Jackson (24th)  Cory Joseph (29th)  Butler (30th)  **2012**  *no one notable*  **2013**  THJ (24th)  Reggie Bullock (25th)  Roberson (26th)  Gobert (27th)   **2014**  Capela (25th)  Bogdan Bogdanovic (27th)  Kyle Anderson (30th)  **2015**  Bobby Portis (22nd)  RHJ (23rd)  Tyus Jones (24th)  Nance (27th)  Looney (30th)  **2016**  Korkmaz (26th)  Siakam (27th)  Dejounte Murray (30th)  **2017**  Jarrett Allen (22nd)  OG (23rd)  Kuzma (27th)  Derrick White (29th)  Josh Hart (30th)  **2018**  Grayson Allen (21st)  Aaron Holiday (23rd)  Simons (24th)  Shamet (26th)  Robert Williams (27th)  **2019**  Clarke (21st)  Bazley (23rd)  Keldon Johnson (29th)  KPJ (30th)  **2020**  Maxey (21st)  Nnaji (22nd)  Hampton (24th)  Quickley (25th)  Printchard (26th)  Bane (30th)"
It is *some* consolation that maybe frank will be a champion finally. Fuck Grayson allen and that cheap ass duke team
"I think it is because he is actually skilled. Other dirty players are no where near as skilled. PatBev, Grayson Allen and obviously a lot more and that makes a huge difference. You have some leeway for bullshit when you actually contribute to more than the opposing team's injuries list."
I still hate Duke because I had Wisconsin winning it all in my bracket and would have won $400 if they did. Fuck Tyus Jones and Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen can ride the bench
If this were Grayson Allen the guy would have been dropped from the league like a brick. I had no idea he‚Äôd caused so many injuries already. How is he still around??
I think the guys it‚Äôd convince the most are guys like Grayson Allen or Tyler hansborough. Guys that don‚Äôt project well into the nba but are college superstars on big programs. This kid Mac Mclung maybe too
"It‚Äôs not fans with amnesia, it‚Äôs fans who hesitate to call a guy who does a dirty move every now and then a dirty player. He‚Äôs not always punching dudes, kicking them in the nuts, undercutting them, or intentionally diving at their knees like some of the league‚Äôs dirtier players. It‚Äôs like the people who call Olynyk a dirty player every time he fouls someone because he broke KLove‚Äôs arm or whatever.  CP3 has done some sketchy stuff here and there, but he‚Äôs not a dirty player like Pat Bev, Grayson Allen, Zaza, or Marcus Morris or any of the other major dirty players in the league."
Jokic literally makes the same move every time he thinks he doesn‚Äôt get a call genius. He got called out for it after the game.   But hey the sub doesn‚Äôt defend end of bench player Grayson Allen. You proved me wrong.    Luka and Jokic live on a pedestal here. You need to be a blind child or an idiot to not see that. You absolute clown.
"Ayyy jazz fan, we hated Grayson Allen too. Has nothing to do with skin tone."
"If Jokic had a history of being a dirty fuck, people would've given him shit for it regardless of skin color. Just look at any thread about Grayson Allen, you absolute clown."
Fuck Grayson Allen
Olynyk and Grayson Allen for sure. Beverly is like a barking dog but those two will injure a player really bad when they get the chance to. I truly believe that Grayson Allen has some mental issues and is a psychopath
Grayson Allen in the same tier IMO
Grayson Allen loves to trip people intentionally
*Grayson Allen has entered the chat*
"I agree with that with friends you know, but I just can't extend that level of warranty to NBA players.    I play basketball (not in any professional way, of course), as I'm sure you do.  And people who play like Beverley are the worst....but then to be as dirty and straight up disrespectful as he is, without even really backing it up with anything on  the court?  Like, fuck those types of players, even if they are on my team.  Sorry man, I totally understand how fandom can make you feel irrational shit, but Patrick Beverley types are just too much and inexcusable.  I have a buddy who is a diehard Grizzlies fan who simply can't stand Grayson Allen for similar reasons (sorta).  There are just some players that are inexcusably dirty and assholes and not even that good at basketball."
Grayson Allen maybe?
Grayson Allen wants his title back
"Stfu Jae, you pulled a Grayson Allen there"
No Grayson Allens yet? I'll start. Grayson Allen.
"Come on man.  Grayson Allen or Kyle Anderson isn‚Äôt better than Wiggins and Dray. Dray was first team all defense this year, and Wiggins was great. That is an absurd take."
100% Grayson Allen but I love him now
I like everyone on the Suns except Jae Crowder. I like everyone one the Grizzlies except for Grayson Allen. But damn do i hate Grayson Allen a helluva lot more than Crowder.
I feel like you're forgetting about Dillon Brooks and Grayson Allen.
"What reality am I living in where Grayson Allen is likable lmao  I'm kidding. Their brand of basketball in the playoffs was incredibly easy to root for. Ja is charismatic and Dillon Brooks, a villain to Utah, was incredible to watch as a 3rd party viewer."
Grayson Allen - Dirty player. Looks very inbred.
Jazz Rookie Grayson Allen 40 pts vs Clippers. An elite 3 and D player. Future all star.
"Donovan Mitchell for Grayson Allen, straight up"
"I'll raise you, I like all of them *and* Grayson Allen.  I guess I have a soft spot for shithouses."
Grayson Allen lowkey best form in the league rn
Lol no doubt man they both are. Neither as bad as Grayson Allen tho.
"Luka is literally an extreme anomaly.   Watch how the grizzlies role players stepped up in that warriors game and you have your answer on how ja made the playoffs. Brooks, Kyle Anderson, Valubcunas stepped up. Even Bane and Grayson Allen were great for them. Ja didn‚Äôt do anything Zion didn‚Äôt do last year. It‚Äôs just the team succeeded because they had winning players.   Trae had that exact same label as an empty stats player that can‚Äôt lead to winning in his first and second year. Even in his third year, the FO spent big bucks on Gallo, Bogi, Rondo, Dunn and even then we‚Äôre doing pretty bad until Nate McMillan came. It‚Äôs like nba fans have the memory of goldfish, they keep making these same takes, getting proved wrong and passing them on to the next player"
"For Grayson Allen and Tillman. Grizz get Luka and dame. Mavs get a three point shooter, and Portland gets a solid young defensive big."
Grayson Allen
Feel like he‚Äôs not mentioned much among dirty players  as often as some obvious  ones... tho he does stuff constantly... also always has people defending him on here(heat fans)  ... never has gotten the full Grayson Allen treatment I don‚Äôt think ... you may be right tho
Grayson Allen tripping lebron
How on earth is Grayson Allen not ours? Hes my #1 with a fucking bullet.
People hated Grayson Allen. Also Dellavedova for a bit. It's just that there aren't too many pesky white defenders.
"&gt; Only person I‚Äôm assuming is racist is you, sorry. I‚Äôm showing the subtle racism that persists on this sub based off of multiple players, and you‚Äôre claiming there‚Äôs no such thing.   So many things to pick part here lol. It's not just me, you think there is a racial bias present amongst the entire demographic of this sub, don't know why you're contradicting yourself. Also you say it's multiple players, when in reality you can only point to three, Luka, Jokic, and Grayson Allen (one of which isn't beloved and one is universally hated, again your argument holds no weight). And I acknowledged earlier that there is racial bias present everywhere among everyone, that's obvious. I just don't think it's as prevalent or heinous as you do.  &gt; Maybe someday you‚Äôll stop jumping to conclusions and arguing against what you want to believe. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äòre so closed minded, and have good day kiddo.  You hear that? That's the sound of the pot calling the kettle black"
Who the fk is Grayson Allen lol
As if people dont torch grayson allen already
Agreed but I also feel like it‚Äôs rightful karma. Dude does so many little dirty plays that we all give him a pass for. We would be torching Grayson Allen if he did the same shit Chris Paul did
"Yea I‚Äôm not sure how anyone can root for this certified vermin. Like aside from Clippers fans and their bandwagon fans, is anyone really a PatBev fan? Dirty ass scum that fakes playing passionate D  but is actually playing dirty. The move he pulled on Westbrook isn‚Äôt easy to forget. The only piece of shit that I hate on the same level is Grayson Allen, The Scum from Duke."
"On the all FP&amp;A team with Caruso, Ingles, Huerter, and Grayson Allen."
"Jokic is not a dirty player, gets shafted by refs when he does flop, and still receives hate  Grayson Allen is one of the most hated plays in the league, that includes on this sub. Only reason Beverley gets so much more hate is because on top of being dirty, he runs his mouth more than anyone.  The LeBron white scenario has no basis. Larry Bird is a white player comprable to LeBron, yet he is by consensus not as good, and no one claims him to be the goat.  Obviously there is racial bias everywhere in life, including basketball, but not to the extreme people like you think there is. The fact that there's only a handful of successful popular white players, and you automatically assume the main reason they're well received is their white skin, is ludicrous."
"One comment post says ""Grayson Allen will be a transcendent player""  Haaaaahahahaha"
"I understand the question.  Who is the worst player that you can think of that you would draw up a last play for that would guarantee a wide open shot, and you would justify this was the right play because you passed on having KD taking the contested shot against a good defender.   My answer....  Grayson Allen."
"Feels great to see them lose, such an unlikeable team. PG and Kawhi are chill, but Morris and Cousins are trash, and Pat Bev is a certified vermin, rivaled only by Grayson Allen, the Scum from Duke."
"I'd like to nominate Grayson Allen for diversity purposes, although maybe he's cleaned up his act since college I haven't seen him play much."
Needs Rob Williams over Grayson Allen.
Yeah. Leaving him off the bench for Grayson Allen is a bit too harsh
Are we all forgetting about Grayson Allen?
Grayson Allen will get there if he's allowed to play more high leverage minutes on the national stage.
"Conley for 2 firsts, Grayson Allen, Jae Crowder, and a traded player exception.  Marc Gasol for Jonas Valanciunas, Delon Wright, CJ Miles."
I feel PG's pain. Missing both FTs when you are up with a few seconds left in the game. A Devin Booker buzzer beater 3 is the only thing that it needs for it to be pretty much the same situation Grayson Allen went through.
The starting back court of the All-Doesn't Deserve it NBA Team is Patrick Beverley and Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen
Draymond combined with Grayson Allen would be the dirtiest basketball player of all time
"There's been at least one sniper taking between 20-30 every year in the draft for a long time now, pretty remarkable:  **2020:** Desmond Bane (30)  **2019:** Jordan Poole (28 - arguable)  **2018:** Grayson Allen (21), Landry Shamet (26)  **2017:** OG Anunoby (23)  **2016:** Furkan Korkmaz (26)  **2015:** Bobby Portis (22)  **2014:** Bogdan Bogdanovic (27)  **2013:** Tim Hardaway Jr (24), Reggie Bullock (25)  **2012:** Evan Fournier (20)  **2011:** Nikola Mirotic (23)  **2010:** Off year - maybe Greivis Vasquez (28)?  **2009:** Darren Collison (21), Omri Casspi (23), Wayne Ellington (28).  **2008:** Ryan Anderson (21)  **2007:** Jared Dudley (22), Aaron Brooks (26), Arron Afflalo (27)."
Imagine a player like Grayson Allen demanding max money because fans from duke would watch him play. You wouldn't be far off in that scenario
Dude I hate Grayson Allen so much every since duke
Grayson Allen still exists
Lmao and this sub thinks Grayson Allen is bad
"Mike is definitely the nicest guy in the NBA, but our best player ever was ZBO and we had Tony Allen. They stayed chirping. Currently we have Grayson Allen and Dillon Brooks. We deffo have the over the top shit talkers."
Grayson Allen
Conley is just a likeable player. The anti-Grayson Allen
Not sure actually i love my team.  Probably Grayson Allen.
"I'm still pissed about that game. Grayson Allen, that little slut."
"&gt;Allen just averaged 23.1 MPG in the playoffs  And he was in the G-League when that trade happened, he had far less value than Thybulle has now   &gt;At the time of the trade Bazley was the 23rd overall pick  And Maxey was the 21st, and clearly has a higher ceiling  &gt;Green is not better than Crowder.  Green is a 3 time champion for a reason. He's been better than Crowder his entire career.  &gt;So in total, trading away Conley got the Grizzlies; Grayson Allen, Brandon Clarke, Winslow, Melton  That's not how trades work. In total, what the Jazz valued Conley at, was Crowder, a G-Leager, a 38 year old and a heavily protected 1st."
"The amount of Warriors fans I‚Äôve come across that act like your FO can do no wrong and that every move they make is the perfect move, whether it be drafting raw talent and thinking Wiggins is an amazing pick up while completely ignoring his deficiencies and why he was considered a very meh player his whole career. Along with not understanding that a guy like Steph falls into your lap like once in a life time, and why surrounding him with raw rookies during the end of his prime is a bad idea. Like y‚Äôall literally just missed the playoffs with Curry going ballistic yet I see so many Warriors fans continue to defend the FOs choice in drafting rookies and not making trades to get Curry help. Grayson Allen literally cost nothing."
"We got good too fast, and our ceiling with last years squad is probably 2nd round exit  moving JV and Grayson Allen saved us money and Ziaire is def a project  If everything works out we'll be contending in a few years but there's a lot of variables in that scenario"
He scored 17ppg on decent efficiency and plays good defense for like 12 mil per year. He's probably their third-best player. Why would they move him for two seconds? They got two seconds for Grayson Allen. Do you think Grayson is better than Dillon?
Bucks got Grayson Allen for that price plus a 60th pick in Sam Merrill
It‚Äôs so weird I have no clue why they‚Äôre doing it. It‚Äôs not like they were given particularly good value or anything. Literally gave Grayson Allen away for nothing.
I‚Äôm guessing that these potential moves along with giving away Grayson Allen for free and trading away JV signals a rebuild?
"Grayson Allen was literally traded for nothing, I‚Äôm sure they could‚Äôve made something work, those are moves savvy front offices are supposed to make. Steph is only getting older and your rookies are not win now players."
"Memphis has been one of the spots I thought Warriors should‚Äôve traded with, they basically gave away Grayson Allen and now Brooks and Slowmo are available, all these guys would be great next to Steph."
"Feel like the team chemistry and depth will be better for the Bucks. Jrue‚Äôs on court synergy with Giannis wasn‚Äôt great to start the year (he even said it himself basically).   George Hill and Grayson Allen are upgrades from last year over Augustin/Teague and Forbes respectively. Losing PJ hurts but he‚Äôs a pretty situational player at this point (especially during the regular season). Hood could bounce back and be a nice bench piece. Semi is a thick body, plays solid defense, and can hit a 3 (similar to PJ). I don‚Äôt expect much from the young guys; Mamu/Nwora could contribute in spot minutes.   Giannis/Khris/Jrue might play a little less though and overall Bud doesn‚Äôt take the regular season very seriously so hard to say. I think they have a good chance to get the top seed."
Grayson Allen averages 14 PPG on 44/40/88 and steals the starting SG spot after playing well with Donte out to start the year.

"Grayson Allen is missing a digit, 387k vs 38.7k shown here"
Klay replacing whoever wins the starting shooting guard battle between Grayson Allen and Donte Divecenzo
"Well in a perfect world that return would be desirable but I‚Äôd imagine Grayson Allen was shopped around to more than just the Bucks. And it‚Äôs also worth noting, he hasn‚Äôt exactly been a healthy player so far in his career. The Jazz were happy to get rid of him. He still has maturity issues, two years ago he got rejected from a Summer League game and our fanbase was ready to just move on from him then. He‚Äôs turned it around but for the Grizzlies this is a big picture move. Get assets now for a guy you‚Äôre not likely to resign. And it‚Äôs not like the Grizzlies are a championship or bust team for next season."
"U think adding George Hill and Grayson Allen makes u better defensively like come on mate. There is a reason George Hill was waived, he is not that same player he was before. Maybe he finds his groove back in Milwaukee, I will admit that replacing Forbes with Allen is actually pretty good."
"I am gonna get a lot of downvotes but I have a hot take where I feel like the bucks got worse this offseason, they lost Bryn Forbes ( huge factor in winning the heat series) and PJ Tucker (his defense was insane in the playoffs and just like how the Heat missed Jae Crowder last szn, I feel like the bucks are gonna have a similar effect). They replaced them with Grayson Allen and George Hill (who was waived by Philly and was not good last szn). It might be a hot take, but I have the Heat over the Bucks rn. My order is Nets, Heat, and then the Bucks."
I think the point is less about trading Allen and more that his price was absurdly cheap. A pair of 2nds is what you receive in a contract dump trade. Grayson Allen is definitely not a guy in that situation.
"A lot of it is just to avoid paying people (JV, Grayson Allen) that didn't fit our timeline  and the Ziaire pick I think is just mainly for the upside  I'm not 100% in agreement with these moves yet but only time will tell ig"
"Everyone in this thread is saying Kings have a worse roster but Hield, Bogdanovic, Barnes would have all started for Memphis. Holmes is a perfectly good center. Ja is a leader and creates wins. Maybe Fox would drag his team to the play in with Grayson Allen, Dillon Brooks, Kyle Anderson and JV, we'll never know but we know Ja did."
Bucks just flipped seconds for Grayson Allen. They can be useful to make trades possible.
"Every team in the NBA has room for a skill set like Grayson Allen, no Memphis fan before trade that happened wouldve been like ""Yes we should do this this makes sense for our franchise and isnt selling low on him"". It's all just hindsight rationalizations after you see the franchise dump him for nothing ""Oh of course it makes sense to just give him away, cant pay him and we have depth!!"". It's all just dishonest rationalizations."
"This doesn't include Grayson Allen, who is restricted, has been a starter and is starter-quality."
"Memphis stuff, taking flyers on some young guys whilst their core still needs to develop, get some picks from unloading a guy like Grayson Allen. It's a solid offseason for a borderline playoff team, they're just aiming to develop Ja and see if JJJ might be something.    Pels swung for the fences but struck out on PG's and didn't seem to really land any of their targets."
PG: Grayson Allen SG: Jarret Culver SF: Kyle Kuzma PF: Udonis Haslem C: Bol Bol
That's why we invested in Grayson Allen.
"no they aren't, they're still mad at Grayson Allen for being good at basketball 6 years ago lol"
PG- IT SG-Grayson Allen SF-Solomon Hill PF-Jared Dudley C-Andre Drummon
I think Bucks got better although I have bias. Lost Tucker but added Grayson Allen and George Hill as well as Rodney Hood and Semi Ojeleye. Bench could be better. Add back a healthy Donte Divincenzo and I‚Äôm pretty happy.
"1. Giannis 2. Middleton 3. Portis 4. Divincenzo 5. Connaughton 6. Grayson Allen  &amp;#x200B;  Idk about Jrue, watching him in Philly and New Orleans, his quickness and athleticism was insane. It's still elite but not the same, though he's smarter and more skilled now."
Giannis  Khris  Jrue  Brook Lopez   Donte Divincenzo  Bobby Portis  Pat Connaughton  And idk Grayson Allen
"Dude I‚Äôm on your side but you‚Äôre the one making Grayson Allen comments    I fucked up too and didn‚Äôt even read Melos clarification before commenting    But nah, you‚Äôre not seeing the bigger picture.   Poor people (and the lower middle class too) are oppressed across the whole planet and media/governments use shit like AAVE to divide us and you and I both bit the hook today.   I grew up poor, and in a 45% black school. I moved to a city that‚Äôs super into the liberal arts and shit.   These rich fucks cry about AAVE all day when I first moved here and I learned to speak differently.   Back home NOBODY gave af how I talked regardless of race.  It‚Äôs all just bullshit identity politics played by power brokers on the left and right trying to get poor people to infight instead of look at what they have in common.  Barkley always has great takes on this   https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/ncaa-basketball/news/charles-barkley-politicians-system-divide-and-conquer/16hwa0zk23hdg1er0zoa6up3gn"
Jon Scheyer is like Stipe Miocic compared to Grayson Allen.
"I think the bucks will be fine without injury.  Jrue - Donte - Middleton - Bobby - Giannis is amazing lineup if the go small ball. Also they still have lopez, Grayson Allen, pat Connaughton."
"John Horst might be the best GMs when it comes to non-Superstar trades.  He turned the number 31 pick this year into Grayson Allen and 2 players.  He turned the number 23 pick into PJ Tucker, getting off the DJ Augustin deal, and that same #31 pick by trading this year's first for our 1st from next year.  He turned 4 second-rounders (2 of which he acquired by taking on minimal deals when we had cap space) into Mirotic (who ended up not working out but was a great trade idea).  Dude has been really great on those meat and potato trades which I don't think get enough credit."
I could see Grayson Allen having one but that's pretty much it
"Starting 5: Isiah Thomas, Ron Artest, Larry Johnson, Dennis Rodman, Alonzo Mourning  Bench: Grayson Allen, Draymond Green, Bill Laimbeer, Pat Bev and Zaza Pachulia  Coach: Chuck Daly  ps. Goodluck surviving on em üòÇ"
Didn‚Äôt Grayson Allen do it his rookie year? I forget
 Lmao he was lucky. Grayson Allen would have torn his meniscus
Grayson Allen is pretty much stupid petty schoolyard shit like tripping people. Don't get me wrong that's still super shitty to do but then again maybe its worse since I never see the dude play.
Grayson Allen üëÄ
Did the announced confuse Grayson Allen for Jae Crowder? That‚Äôs a good one
Can literally see Grayson Allen in the clip lol
"Exactly. But remember, Grayson Allen is the pinnacle of evil because he tripped a few guys"
"Naw dog, Grayson Allen is amazing."
Fuck Grayson Allen
"As a Grizz fan, I never thought I could bring myself to cheer for quite a few players we‚Äôve acquired over the years: Matt Barnes, Grayson Allen, Joakim Noah. But they‚Äôve always proved me wrong! Here‚Äôs hoping PatBev is next in line (although I think he has the biggest gap to fill in my brain of all of em)."
"He isn‚Äôt like some other dudes, who are just annoying. He flat out tries to hurt opponents. I grew to love Grayson Allen, because tripping isn‚Äôt harmful, but I‚Äôll pass on Bev, who continously tries to dive at people‚Äôs knees."
"Imagine if he and Grayson Allen were in Memphis together, along with Brooks. The vitriol levels would be off the charts even Ja wouldn't be enough to offset it."
Grayson in the nba barely scratches the surface of dirty nba players... there are like 100 dirtier nba players since Bill lambier than Allen. His bad reputation comes from the shit he did at duke
Just think of him as black Grayson Allen.
Was just thinking how hated this team would be if they still had Grayson Allen.
He is the dirtiest player since Bill Laimbeer. Worse than CP. Worse than Grayson Allen. You didn't even bring up the clips of him kicking dudes in the nuts
"We were already targets for ""preventing"" the Bubble Suns to make the play - in and for defending Grayson Allen.  Also for [opposing PG] Vs Ja and Ayton vs JJJ."
Wait i just realized I like the grizzlies now that Grayson Allen is gone   That's exciting
Grayson Allen
We got Grayson Allen so I guess we're hated now even though he hasn't an incident in like two years
Grayson Allen replacement
Grayson Allen
Maybe bc the Grizz traded Grayson Allen and needed to fill a dirty player quota. They could have been the greatest duo of unlikable players ever.   The world will never know - until theyre both playing together in China with Lance.
At least you don't have him AND Grayson Allen I guess
"He was their best player last season and I'm not sure that's really that low-key.  Getting rid of him (and to a lesser extent Grayson Allen) was a clear sign they're not planning on being as good next season as they were last year. But that they're going all in on the young core.    As a fan I'd rather see a playoff appearance than a potential future playoff appearance. Fingers crossed it works out. I'm not sold on jaren Jackson yet, but maybe he'll end up pretty good"
Grayson Allen was traded to the Bucks.
"Memphis really trying to gather an all NBA hated team with Grayson Allen, Beverly, Rondo, and Dillion Brooks.   Dunno maybe its just me who dislikes those players"
"Makes sense. Grizzlies lost Grayson Allen , so they took bev. Need a dirty player for another dirty player"
From Grayson Allen to Patrick Beverley lol
The Grayson Allen x Pat Bev synergy would have been crazy üî•üî•üî•
Memphis shipped off Grayson Allen so they needed to refill their asshole quota.
Memphis lost Grayson Allen so they got Pat Bev.
"I was sad to see my favorite player, grayson allen, get traded to the bucks. But now we have my second favorite player, Patrick Beverly!!!"
grizzlies got rid of grayson allen just to trade for pat bev lmaoooo
Grayson Allen will beat him because he'll trip him.
"Never said anything about giving them the keys to the offense but having a cost controlled rookie to come off your bench to replace the Forbes/Teague minutes then grow from there seemed like it made sense in the short term and long term. McBride, Butler, Sharife, and Ayo all ended up in the 2nd round and all would‚Äôve made a lot of sense in Milwaukee.  I do like that you guys got Grayson Allen which was basically theft lmao, but him and donte will be RFA‚Äôs next season and one of them may get priced out of what MKE is willing to offer"
It is totally unrelated to Grayson Allen which is what this thread is about...   Goodbye dude I don‚Äôt care about this anymore. Also telling the mods.
"They were looking for a big and guards often take time to adjust. They‚Äôre not gonna give him the keys to run the offence lol.   We flipped it into Grayson Allen anyways who‚Äôs better and Mamu as well, he looks like an interesting prospect."
"As much as y‚Äôall hate him, Grayson Allen‚Ä¶knows his role, scrappy, has a pure stroke and plays with no fear."
"Yes.  I play your mother and Grayson Allen the most minutes.  Since my win is guaranteed, I funnel all shots through these two players."
Who‚Äôs first? Christian Laetter? Grayson Allen?
No one on this sub knows Grayson Allen besides Memphis fans and it shows.
Wasnt he giving more than Grayson allen production though? Didnt he go off in some games in the bubble playoffs?
"Hot take apparently, but the reason he isn‚Äôt on a roster is because he simply isn‚Äôt worth the bad press. If he gave something like Grayson Allen level production he‚Äôd have a spot right now."
It was Grayson Allen.
&gt;!Grayson Allen!&lt; not sure why he didn‚Äôt declare for the draft right after that season.
"It's funny I felt the exact same way about our organization, staff, and players.  Then we went and traded for Grayson Allen... who I used to show videos of to my girlfriend showing how dirty of a player he is lol.      Heard that stuff is in his past and he's a solid role player now so hoping it's true."
"&gt;whoever our 15th man will be this season  Jinxed it, 15th will now be Grayson Allen"
"I think Grayson Allen is going to kill it for Milwaukee, he gives them scoring punch of the bench they haven't had"
Bucks? So we could have Stephenson and Grayson Allen after winning a championship? We might legit go from being a team everyone loves to a team everyone hates in like 3 months lol
"Two things that are both reffing related:  1. Refs not calling fouls on plays unless they're forced to by either a missed shot, a flop, or forcing the player off his current movement. An example would be a big man going up strong for a dunk with guys raking his arms on the way up, but because the big man can power through for the made dunk those fouls aren't called.  2. Refs calling the game differently for different players. The game should be called the same way for the worst player in the league as it is for the best. A players reputation as a great defender should also not play a factor in how they're called. If it's a foul when Grayson Allen does it, it should be a foul when Giannis does it."
"Starters: Jamal Murray (7) (WHAT A STEAL), Tim Hardaway Jr (14), Kyle Anderson (11) , Giannis (40), Nikola Jokic (39)  Bench: Justin Holiday (4) (Absolute Bargain), Grayson Allen (4), Naz Reid (3).  This team should be good enough to win a title. I really like Giannis and Jokic as a pairing as well.Jokic as a pairing as well."
"Credit to OP for the awesome structure and idea.  Starting LineUp:  PG: Kemba Walker 10  SG: James Harden 38  SF: LeBron James 39  PF: Marcus Morris 12  C: Nerlens Noel 8  Bench:  Guards: Grayson Allen 4  Wings: Josh Hart 6  Bigs: Bobby Portis 3  First of all I wanted to say awesome job OP, definitely looks like you worked hard on this list and I like it. Also, side note I think you mistook Troy Brown Jr for Bruce Brown Jr. I probably spent more time than I should‚Äôve at this so I hope you guys enjoy.  Anyways, for my team. I went with the approach that‚Äôs been working most for basically the past decade and more now, LeBron plus shooting and playmaking.  Team Reasons:  My strategy was picking up guys who I thought was the best bang for your buck, who I thought were huge steals and honestly I think a lot of these guys are undervalued.  Kemba Walker for 10 is a steal, this is still someone with excellent on ball and off ball guard ability who can average 20ish PPG in that role doing so. He can take pressure off Harden &amp; LeBron.  James Harden is I think the best SG in the game and his scoring and playmaking ability never to someone like LeBron would be amazing like we‚Äôve seen similarly with Chris Paul in the past. He‚Äôd make everyone around him better and scores with ease.  LeBron James age may hurt him but I‚Äôm a strong believer in him. I think he‚Äôll still be as good as ever and at the very highest a step slower but that‚Äôs still a damn good player. His playmaking ability next to this team will be huge.  Marcus Morris for 12 is a huge steal. He averaged 20ish PPG on the Knicks and is an amazing shooter who‚Äôs proven he can play with multiple wings as a small ball C or a wing in general.  Nerlens Noel is someone who I think can thrive as a starter especially next to James Harden. His defence is definitely good enough to sustain a starting spot.  Bench:  Grayson Allen I think is someone who you undervalued OP because he was a starter on a playoff team who averaged 11 PPG shooting lights out from 3, 39% making 2 a game. He also has good enough playmaking ability and to do stuff off the dribble.  Bobby Portis per 36 stats last season he was second in the league in points off the bench and first in rebounding for 3 BP is amazing. Good floor spacer too if Nerlens isn‚Äôt playing well.  Josh Hart or Terrence Ross I couldn‚Äôt decide between. They‚Äôre the same price but I‚Äôm not sure if Ross as a 6th man is a better fit or Hart as a small ball lineup player. I think id go with Hart because of his rebounding even though TRoss is a bigger name.  I think this team has the perfect amount of playmaking, scoring, floor spacing and just enough defence to help them. I‚Äôd honestly say this is the best team anyone can come up with but I do not wanna get ahead of myself."
"&gt; Grayson Allen  A real ""[player trips fan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_bites_dog)"" situation."
Grayson Allen lmao
Grayson Allen is not the shithead he was in college anymore and people are doing him a disservice by pretending he still is. He's a solid NBA player but people don't watch him or give him credit because dUkE PlaYEr BaD. The hate is way over the top and is just embarrassing to see whenever his name comes up on here.

"Grizz did something similar, maybe not all to their preferred situations, but to great ones: Marc/Toronto, Mike/Utah, Crowder and Iggy/Miami, Delon Wright/Dallas, Grayson Allen/Milwaukee. But they got good returns for most."

"It was so messed up.  On the plus side you guys won a title and just got an extremely underrated player in Grayson Allen from us for almost nothing.  I understand why we did it, too much depth and not enough PT for them all, but I really wish we could've gotten some more value for him.  If any team deserved to get lucky break on landing a player of that archetype its you guys"
"I understand the Bulls, not sure about the Pacers and the Raptors. However, you guys also lost your 2nd best player of the past season and a valuable role player, Grayson Allen."
Strange that you'd say the bucks. The q. Is who takes a step back. The bucks have lost pj and Forbes and gained Grayson Allen and semi. Everyone else is back. I see other teams taking s step forward but I don't see the bucks taking s step back.
"Grayson Allen this year, maybe"
"Grayson Allen is probably the least liked, although he just arrived so idk"
"And when his best teammates are Giannis, Khash and Jrue instead of Ja and Dillon Brooks? Grayson Allen in a contract year? That guy might go nuts."
"Being a better athlete in no way makes him better?  Is Russ the best player in the league? How about Grayson Allen or John wall?  Athleticism can be a tool that helps you actually produce, in the way that someone like giannis does, but it by itself is pretty meaningless.  There are plenty of insane athletes with no basketball skill, who couldn‚Äôt even make the league.  Giannis isn‚Äôt the best player because he‚Äôs the most athletic.  Giannis is the best player because he plays DPOY defense and scores at a crazy efficient rate.  DWill couldn‚Äôt even use his athleticism to be an average defender, while Chris Paul was elite on defense.  There is nothing that DWill was better at than Chris Paul."
Connaughton won‚Äôt be the temporary Donte replacement.  There‚Äôs a reason we traded for Grayson Allen.
"I think, Bucks also improved considering that they acquired numerous role players to rely on (Hill, Grayson Allen, Rodney Hood) for a title repeat. The absence of PJ in terms of switchability might sting a bit, but I think they are optimistic on Ojeleye's growth  Yeah they might lose on any top 10 team, but it is what it is. They are the reigning NBA champions, and their morale is sky high entering this upcoming season"
"Grayson Allen is for sure a big upgrade on depth, especially once donte is back. Hoping we can get something out of Hill or Semi."
"It sucks losing pj but Grayson Allen is good DiVincenzo insurance, George Hill is a solid backup pg, and if Rodney Hood can return to form theyre gonna be in pretty good shape"
"Nice, you ever been told you run like Grayson Allen?"
think grayson allen but if grayson was also able to singlehandedly get hot enough from outside to eviscerate your alma mater
"As a duke fan who started watching when JJ was in college, I can definitely confirm.  Even I hate Grayson Allen, he's childish and dirty.   JJ was good and cocky (‚åê‚ñ†_‚ñ†)"
Grayson Allen also is not anything close to a dirty player anymore. I hope he'll mirror Reddick in that once he's in the league a while he loses his villain status.
"Hansbrough was disliked by many people, but the hate for him was nowhere near the level it was for Redick, or even Grayson Allen after Hansbrough (and Redick)."
Grayson Allen just sucks he runs like that kid who would take heelie wheels out for mile day during PE
"I think this officially marks the first retirement of a player that I remember watching and hearing about from his college days. Well, I faintly remember the 2005 UNC guys like Raymond Felton and Marvin Williams, but my memory really starts with the 2009 team, which features guys who are still doing work right now. Reddick was so hated, though, that he stuck in my young mind as being the face of the mid 2000s Duke teams, despite me not remembering much else from that time. What I remember best is that he was hated because he was *good*, unlike say, a Grayson Allen who, while not a bad player, was and is hated because of his dirty play."
Grayson Allen was dirty. JJ was just cocky.   JJ is the fun kind of ‚Äúlove to hate‚Äù. Grayson you just hated.
He was a gigantic douche. But he wasn‚Äôt unlikable like Grayson Allen who is a whole different kind of douche.  JJ was great and he let us know he knew it. He wasn‚Äôt dirty. He just beat you down and laughed while he was doing it. Infuriating.
[Grayson Allen has entered the chat]
"I mean, I don‚Äôt hate him for not contributing on the Mavericks. More frustrated because we could‚Äôve used guys like James Johnson and Iwundu, just 6‚Äô7 athletic bodies to throw at Kawhi and PG in the first round. But, I never hated JJ Redick, never hated Grayson Allen, too young for Laettner"
"Back then, people hated Reddick for being too innocent, and now people hate Grayson Allen for being a dirty player. Definitely says a lot about the perception of white players coming out of Duke."
Grayson Allen appears and suddenly fans are clamoring for the days of JJ Reddick.  Kind of like how the Star Wars prequels suddenly looked like high art after Disney released their abominations.
Grayson Allen 1.0
I still don‚Äôt like Grayson Allen
"Grayson ""the Apology"" Allen."
I could see Grayson Allen following a similar path. The dude went from a dirty college player to a guy a lot of Memphis really liked and rooted for. Now he's going to be playing a similar role on a Bucks team looking to repeat.   I also may be assuming based on the fact that he's another mouthy sharp shooting white dude from Duke lol.
"A big who can handle the ball like jokic and a 2 way guard like kawhi for all stars i would have two athletic guards like Jamal Murray and Mitchell. For the role players id have jae crowder, joe Harris, Tim Hardaway Jr, javale Mcgee, Duncan Robinson, and Caruso. The end of the bench could be Grayson Allen and Jah"
"Well unlike Ted Cruz, the worst thing Grayson Allen did was play dirty in basketball like 3-4 years ago."
Grayson Allen with a beard is just Ted Cruz
"Grayson Allen with Ricky Rubio hair and maybe a sleeve, people won't hate him as much I'm unironically confident of this."
So you're telling me Grayson Allen with a beard would be the most liked player in the league?
"Giannis, Jrue, Khris, Mccollum, Brook Lopez with Donte Divencenzo, Bobby Portis and Grayson Allen off the bench  Vs.  KD, Harden, Kyrie, Joe Harris, Patty Mills with Blake Griffin, Bruce Brown and Lemarcus Aldrige off the bench.  Bucks match pure talent and probably win team fit here too. Second option is much worse from Harden to Jrue but Middleton is pretty close to Kyrie because of his defense and how valuable shooting is rn, while the Bucks have a better bench and Mccollum absolutely blows Joe Harris away as a player."
Grayson Allen is relatively likeable wdym. Do a deep dive and get past the uhhh drama and he‚Äôs not too bad.
"Kyle Anderson, Dejounte Murray, Malcolm Brogdon and Grayson Allen"
Grayson Allen is the Zodiac killer? Damn
"Grayson ""The Apology"" Allen will live forever in the hearts of true NBA fans."
I‚Äôm gonna be so mad if Grayson Allen is actually that good and ends up starting for us. It was fun being a likeable team.
Grayson Allen &gt;
&gt;It‚Äôs a meme that Grayson Allen ~~looks like~~ **is** Ted Cruz  ftfy
It‚Äôs a meme that Grayson Allen looks like Ted Cruz.
I'm hoping that Khris Middleton taking him under his wing (pun intended) helps for his development   Also I don't mind the idea of Grayson Allen for what it's worth
They‚Äôre just trying to get that political leverage. Everybody knows Grayson Allen has the most punchable face in the senate
i can‚Äôt tell if this is a grayson allen tripping people joke or a woosh
On r/nba any white guy not named Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen
"Bucks trade Donte Divincenzo and Grayson Allen for him, I‚Äôll say"
"I can see us falling back a bit. Its clear the FO feels no immediate urgency to win now. They are going to rely a ton on how JJJ comes back from injuries and how he handles JV's absence. They also are betting on Bane being their sniper of the future over Grayson ""the Apology"" Allen. And they will give time to see how Ziaire Williams complements everyone else.  But OTOH, i dont think they are done making moves, and the Grizz have overachieved every season with Ja, Jenkins, and Kleiman. And I dont expect next year will be any different.   But they can overachieve and still miss the post season. I think they sneak in to the play-in."
"They got rid of JV because he hinders their future growth by clogging the lane and taking too many shots, and he is up for an extension which he has earned after '22. But they arent going to pay him because timelines dont match, and other guys that fit that timeline are up for their own deals. I disagree with them, but they are rational and reasonable for thinking this. I think the Grizz felt they were too reliant on JV, and that wasnt good for JJJ's development. That I do agree with. JJJ deferred to JV for obvious reasons. But his future depends on him asserting himself more. Adams doesnt need to be fed offensively, is still a smart guy who is, like JV, good in the locker room. He can also still hit the glass and set strong screens. They are releasing offensive touches for the young core. Whatever other assets they received, look to see if you can flip, or reduce their cap hits.  They got rid of Grayson ""the Apology"" Allen because they had 13 guys worth playing, including too many wings. They arent getting rid of Brooks except for an indisputable upgrade at 3 *and* D. Allen and Bane are similar 3pt shooters. Bane is also younger, and better on D, and on the second year of his 4 year rookie deal (an advantage of late FRPs over early 2RPs). Allen has earned a new deal greater than a rookie deal after next season. And they wont give it to him. Nor are they keeping both. So you give him your thanks and send him to another coach in the Pop mafia (Snyder to Jenkins to Bud). Save money without losing much production, double down on youth and see what you got playing Bane a little more.  The Grizz arent buying out players so they will go to the Lakers. They are buying out players that arent young and good enough for the Grizz. They released D12 because they saved almost 6 million. They went from CJ Miles at 8.7, to D12 at 5.6 (saving 3.1 mill), then bought out D12 for 3, saving another 2.6 (the amount I think the LAL were paying him so he didnt lose any money), for a total savings of 5.7 (65% of Miles' deal) at a time I think they were trying to squeeze under the cap. It was a masterful pair of transactions, tbh. They dont give a fuck where these guys go, or winning popularity contests with their roster decisions, but they arent fits for *this* team.  The Grizz still arent ready to put all their chips in yet. They still dont know what they have with JJJ (or Clarke), because of injuries and the pandemic fucked an offseason of training with people. They need to find out how fully the promise of their glut of young guys can convert into production and wins."
Did we watch the same Grayson Allen in college he was never likeable
"Same. Liked him since his duke days. That was a likable team. Tyus Jones, Quinn Cook, Justise Winslow, Grayson Allen before his reputation, Semi Ojeleye, a Plumlee bro. They had a squad"
"Milwaukee got Grayson Allen for nothing, but the Lakers trading for Westbrook slightly outweighs the Allen trade or anything else for that matter.  Westbrook &gt; Lowry"
Snoop in the Haslem role going all Murder Was the Case on Grayson Allen in the last game of the season
Grayson Allen.
&gt; My thinking on Allen over Donte is offensive consistency  Grayson Allen is the opposite of consistent lol. BBIQ of an egg
"Starters   PG Jrue   SG Grayson Allen  SF Middleton  PF Giannis   C BroLo   6th Bobby Portis   7th Divincenzo   8th Pat Connaughton   9th George Hill   10th Semi/Rodney Hood/Nwora  Situational Thanasis   Benchwarmers Mamu, Giorgos K  My thinking on Allen over Donte is offensive consistency and availability at the start of the year."
Grayson allen except I‚Äôve always liked him
"Grayson Allen, and then we acquired him. Happy I had already battled that demon."
Grayson Allen because I can‚Äôt hate him now‚Ä¶
Replace Grayson Allen with Donovan Mitchell and Claxton with Nikola Jokic on a vet minimum
"That '15 Duke title squad sent EIGHT guys to the NBA, half of which were freshmen. Hard to believe Grayson Allen might be the most successful pro of that group."
Grayson Allen would like a word
"Golden State is adding Kuminga, Moody, Porter, Klay, etc, plus hopefully improvements by Wiseman (not certain). I'm pretty sure Memphis just traded their second best player for Bledsoe and Adams lol. Didn't they also lose Grayson Allen?"
"Shooting better from 3 this year is a really disingenuous way to say Jokic shot .1% higher on nearly half the attempts. If you apply that reasoning, Steph‚Äôs a worse 3 point shooter than Wayne Ellington and Grayson Allen is as good a shooter as Dame. Clearly that‚Äôs not true both because of the difficulty of their shots but also because volume matters in evaluating scoring.  Unless you rank 3 point shooters purely on percentage, 38.7% on 6.3 attempts per game is just better than 38.8% on 3.3 attempts per game. If one player is taking drastically more difficult 3s than the other, that‚Äôs a different argument but not one I think is relevant here."
Ive seen Middleton slaughter my Celtics enough times to know how good he is. Wiggins had 22 points and the game tying layup in that game. Ja Morant and Grayson Allen just refused to miss.
"Including Grayson Allen on any kind of all-time team is triggering me, but that's a fun squad lol"
"I like Allen, although they would be a bit undersized:  [Lucius Allen](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/allenlu01.html)  [Ray Allen ](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/allenra02.html)  [Tony Allen](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/allento01.html)  [Grayson Allen] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/allengr01.html)  [Jarrett Allen] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/allenja01.html)  Williams is another good one, although it would be a super small lineup:  [Deron Williams] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/willide01.html)  [Lou Williams] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/willilo02.html)  [Reggie Williams] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/willire01.html)  [Gus Williams] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/willigu01.html)  [Buck Williams] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/willibu01.html)  However the correct answer is obviously Marjanoviƒá."
"Bucks did pretty aight. Lost PJ Tucker but honestly kinda feels like he gave the last of his high level defense in the championship run. Love him either way.  We got what we needed, which was a backup PG whose name wasn't Jeff Teague, and who else could we have gotten other than George Hill, who shot like 40% from 3 back in the 2020 season. Hopefully he isn't washed yet but still a good signing.   Also seems like we got some Donte Insurance in case he gets hurt again in Grayson Allen. In fact it should be interesting to see if the Bucks have to decide between Donte and Grayson, if both have really good seasons.   Rodney Hood is also a low risk high reward guy if he can return to his Portland form off his Achilles injury. Coming into a team and city that just won a title should be a positive environment, and hopefully the training staff can help him get back into the best shape possible.   And of course resigning Bobby was huge. I imagine one of the reasons we let PJ go was so we still had money to give Bobby a better contract next summer"
Lol how is the Grizzlies off season rates a C+ when they gave up JV and Grayson Allen for basically nothing compared to the Pelicans D+.
"Thanks for sharing. But I gotta say I HARD disagree on Grizzlies lacking depth. We got rid of Grayson Allen partially because we had a roster logjam of solid players.   Idk I understand TWolves dealt with really bad injuries last year, but I trust Grizzlies way more than them. Grizzlies have been competing for playoffs the last two years with largely the same  rotation (except Adams for JV). I mean shit they made the playoffs with JJJ not playing 80% of the season last year."
"No I'm talking about it with the context, people like luka for other reasons, not just race. I don't like Kevin love or Grayson Allen, my point is this sub doesn't just worship white people like the users like to pretend. Morant is one of my favorite players seems like an awesome dude so id understand why people like him. People pretend like jokic and luka are liked solely due to skin color, id say that's the real cut and dry case."
"Yeah clearly nothing to do with him fucking over Noel. It's cause he's black, it's always funny when you criticize someone who deserves criticism then people go ""cause he's black"". But this sub likes all white players like Gordon Heyward, Grayson Allen and Kevin love..... wait they hate those guys."
"Villain Brooks  Grayson ""the Apology"" Allen"
You had Grayson Allen on your team dude
Grayson Allen
Lol I'm just imagining Grayson Allen doing everything Charles did.
"I suspect with Donte injured, Grayson Allen might be Bucks starting SG to begin the season.  But it will be interesting to see if Donte wins the job back when healthy.  Also could be interesting to see if Hood can bounce back to pre-injury form, but he probably is still best served as scoring punch of the bench in that case."
"You can't ""cancel"" a NBA player lol, their income isn't based on popularity  Source: Grayson Allen, Patrick Beverley, etc."
"You‚Äôre right, I‚Äôd rather have Grayson Allen than Forbes, but when DiVincenzo went down I thought Forbes played well (at least in the Miami series)"
I would say he's not even top 10 he's close though  No particular order   Paul George  Kawhi Leonard  Kevin Durant  Lebron  Russ  Pat Bev  Ben Simmons  James Harden  Kyrie(maybe? not 100% on this one)  Draymond  Chris Paul      Honorable Mentions    Kelly Olynyk  Rudy Gobert  Grayson Allen  Devin Booker  Kyle Kuzma
The Memphis Grizzlies traded away their best player and are looking to offload Kyle Anderson and Dillon Brooks will not be winning 41 games. Especially since they also traded away Grayson Allen.  Everything they've done has signaled that they want to tank
I think Grayson Allen is better than most people realize
"Buddy hield had another down year, tyrese was a rookie, Barnes was good, and Holmes was good. Jonas and Dillon Brooks were better than all those guys last year. Kyle Anderson and Grayson Allen are solid role players, and all those grizzlies players didn‚Äôt have the burden of getting to be coached by the worst coach in the entire league. So no they are not on par with each other."
"Buddy Hield, Tyrese Haliburton, Harrison Barnes and Richaun Holmes is on par with Grayson Allen, Dillon Brooks, Jonas Valanciunus and Kyle Anderson"
Grayson Allen
Now there's the Grayson Allen we know and hate
It already got reset this year too since Grayson Allen is starting at SG
"LeBron never gets talked about as dirty, but he regularly shoves people that beat him on the dribble, while they are in the air, sometimes hard enough to send them into the audience or stenchion  Grayson Allen is known as dirty, but actually has cleaned up his act."
"-The NBA contracts need to change in some way that doesn‚Äôt allow players to secure a bag and then force themselves out. James Harden or Ben Simmons wanting out is fine by me but there has to be some sort of disadvantage to leaving your team like that. It just seems too lopsided in the players favor.  -Grayson Allen to the bucks was one of the best off-season acquisitions. As a SEC basketball fan I don‚Äôt like him but damn, he can play D shoot 3s and doesn‚Äôt commit costly turnovers. I would say he might be the 3rd most important acquisition behind DeMar and Lowry.  -speaking of DeMar, no one talks about how he just got a career high in assists last season because he was in SA. He is an all star.   -Brandon Ingram and Zion don‚Äôt work well together.  -the second half Anthony Edwards rookie season showed he‚Äôs most likely all-star bound sooner rather than later  -Russ was right about P Bev. He‚Äôs just running around fooling everyone. He doesn‚Äôt really bring anything to a team.  -Dwight Howard was elite in Charlotte"
"Bucks look like they‚Äôre missing 1 strong forward tht can switch and hustle hard like PJ Tucker to unlock the Giannis at center line up.. Maybe Semi Ojeleye can be better? Prob not.  But Grayson Allen, Connaughton and Nwora look like they all improved a lot and looking like legit rotational pieces now"
"Bucks have depth this season. Like, really good depth.  Playoff time the list of rotation players I trust is no longer just Portis and Connaughton. Connaughton opened the season really well (14/5/2 on 57/41/75, vs 7ppg last season), our back-up PG is now not only not Jeff Teague, but actually a *good* back-up PG in George Hill, Jordan Nwora has become a solid rotation player, and one of Grayson Allen/Donte will be coming off the bench. There's *five* players who can come off the bench and contribute, and who can all mix with the starters confidently."
Nah the bucks have none except maybe Grayson Allen but we didn‚Äôt have him last year and hopefully he‚Äôs changed.
"The depth of this Bucks team is *so* much better than it was last season, without giving up anything in the starting five. Yes, PJ is a loss - but Pat Connaughton appears to have taken a huge leap, Nwora has taken a huge leap, Thanasis has taken a leap, one of Grayson Allen/Donte will come off the bench, and - I cannot stress this enough - we have George Hill instead of Jeff Teague as a back-up PG."
"I swear to God Grayson Allen didn't drop 40, you had to have made that up  *Checks Google*  Well I'll be damned... Maybe you're onto something lol"
"That used to happen a lot back in the day too, if you were watching at the time you just likely didn‚Äôt notice/care or you forgot.  Just a quick look through 01-02 Hawks games for example. In a game against the Cavs, Jason Terry (season avg. 19/4/6) dropped 43/5/10 with two blocks while Shareef Abdur-Rahim dropped 36/12/3. In a game against the Bucks Nazr Mohammed (avg. 10/8) dropped 22/19. Game against the Mavs, Jason Terry put up 46. Clippers game, Nazr Mohammed had 30/11.  In 10+ you‚Äôre not going to have any idea Myles Turner had a 40 point game just like you probably don‚Äôt remember Jason Terry dropping 40+ multiple times while Nazr Mohammed was having 30/10s and near 20/20s. Grayson Allen dropped 40 like two years ago and you‚Äôd struggle to find anybody other than fans of the teams he‚Äôs been on that remembers it."
"The example in this thread was trying to draw a shooting foul from the other side of the court, not what Grayson Allen did."
I hope they repeat this year. No one deserves a ring more than Grayson Allen.
"So Michael Jordan, widely considered to be one of the most hyper competitive people on the planet, is in your mind less competitive than Grayson Allen because MJ didn't try to cheat?"
"Grayson ""the Apology"" Allen"
that was grayson allen
"Miles gonna earn himself a max contract  2018 class wildin'   Luka, Trae, Ayton, Shai, JJJ, MPJ, Mikal and Miles Bridges, Sexton   also plenty of really good role players like Donte, Huerter, Rob Williams, Brunson, Gary Trent, Shamet, Graham, Bruce Brown...  also some guys that had trouble with injuries like Bagley, Bamba, Wendell who can still get better and some guys like Grayson Allen and Lonnie that can still improve and become very good role players"
Dudes a dirty player and a bitch. You a Grayson Allen fan as well?
DPOY rim protector Grayson Allen
"Booker reminds me of that pissy ‚Äútroubled‚Äù 1st grader who acts out in violence when he‚Äôs slightly inconvenienced. He‚Äôs always fucking pouting and doing the most lowkey dirty shit, great player but easily the most punchable face and demeanor in the league. He‚Äôs Duke Grayson Allen just less obvious about it. I‚Äôm glad people finally caught on in the playoffs when the Suns had the national spotlight for the first time in his career, because he‚Äôs been this way far before CP3"
"I do, but it's not a given or something I'm necessarily expecting to happen. If Kyrie comes back it gets way more difficult and I'm worried about the Clippers and Jazz in the West.  I like the chances to repeat because it's the same team, but with better depth (George Hill &gt;&gt;&gt; Jeff Teague, and one of Grayson Allen/Donte will be coming off the bench). I'm being cautious and more games are needed to see, but Pat Connaughton genuinely looks like he's improved a lot. As in, he could pick up some 6MOY votes."
Grayson Allen is so proud.
"These are the kinds of stupid split second aggressions that can kill or injure people for life. Just like Grayson Allen and the tripping. Not fucking cool at all, a suspension is definitely in order. Really have no respect for book as a person after seeing this shit. Just a whiny asshole"
"I suspect I watched him on the Jazz/Grizzlies more than you did, dude's dirty as shit.  You can tell because I don't follow and don't give a shit about college ball and know nothing about players' college reputations and I only watch the Warriors in preseason, but I have a deep and abiding contempt for what a dirty piece of shit Grayson Allen is because of *things I've seen him do*."
"Grayson Allen hasn't been dirty since his Summer League, it's all reputation from college."
I'm quite enjoying watching a close game where both teams are playing quite well and there's no drama and neither team is fouling the shit out of the other in ways that infuriate me.  I expect that to change when Grayson fucking Allen takes the floor but so far it's quite refreshing.  ... and as I'm typing that Walker drags Giannis off his feet.
"agree...dont blame you for liking the Suns I just find it interesting you have a guy like Grayson Allen who's rep is basically dogmeat for doing not much worse than anything CP3 has been doing for years, lol."
Grayson Allen &amp;  Davis Bertans
Grayson allen
"Grayson Allen. Even now that he plays for my Bucks. I suppose it's probably because of his ""dirty"" player reputation though."
Grayson Allen is a draw
"I guess but I mean Middleton, Giannis, Hill, Pat C, Grayson Allen.  It‚Äôs not like they were a g-league squad out there."
Is it just me or does Grayson Allen look like a young and athletic David Duchovny?
Mavs shoulda grabbed Grayson Allen while they could
Grayson Allen wants to be Tyler Herro so badly
Grayson Allen is a bust
"True only going up against Giannis, Middleton, Hill, Pat C, George Hill, Grayson Allen."
"Steven Adams, and earlier Grayson Allen.  Also, I hated Chandler Parsons, when he joined, I thought I'd like him, then I really hated him even more."
Grayson Allen is so much worse than Forbes lol why not keep Forbes for $4M???
"How tall is Grayson Allen? Because when I saw him play with Duke, he looked short af. Here he looks tall. How tall was that Duke team, Jesus‚Ä¶"
bucks  running a Justin Robinson / Thansis / Grayson Allen / Nwora / Mamu lineup lmao

"The Grizzlies are hoping this will be a stepping-stone season between the back of the playoff hunt and title contention in the near future. In other words, they hope to be a solidly above average team in the Western Conference. The big question on the team is the recently extended Jaren Jackson Jr. If he is what the Basketbears hope, they could compete for the 6th seed and avoid the Play-In tournament. Other players to watch include De‚Äôanthony Melton, who will see his role increased after the departure of Grayson Allen, and Steven Adams, who looks to improve on a dreary last season in New Orleans. If he looks better than his last campaign, it could be a sign that Morant has genuine ability in making players around him better, something very exiting for the Grizzlies from their third-year star."
"Yes! Bill Simmons makes a lot of jokes about how Tucker can play 40 minutes and have almost zero stats in the box score. But as a lifelong Bucks fan who knows the slightly beta mentality that has plagued the team for so long, it was clear that Tucker was a ROCK for the team. He brought that immoveable, fuck-you-we-belong-here energy. It felt right to have him on the floor in the big games.   I like the depth with Grayson Allen in addition to Connaughton and DiVincenzo. I can't believe we were able to resign Portis. And it looks like there's a solid chance Nwora will reach DiVincenzo status this year, with the potential to be even better than DiVincenzo. STILL, it's a bummer we lost Tucker. He brings that champion, grit it out in the finals vibe."
"Totally agree, people will talk about PJ but not talk about how thin we were at guard without Donte. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm really satisfied with the Grayson Allen trade and Semi Ojeleye on a minimum deal to at least fill PJ‚Äôs role on paper."
Any money they offer PJ is less money available for other players. I'm sure Bucks fans would rather re-sign Donte or Grayson Allen over PJ.
"The bucks imo has an equal chance as lakers or nets to win..no toxic teammates, no question of fit and their best player may well be even more devastating if Giannis' shot is indeed here to stay...They lost PJ tucker but added Grayson Allen who to me prolly seems a perfect sg in the bucks system..what prolly they want divincenzo to be.."
"Regardless, we needed offense not defense.  Last night showed we're still gonna be an elite defense, but now we have better offensive options with Grayson Allen and the development of Nwora."
Fuck Grayson Allen and his history of intentionally trying to hurt people
That's Apex Legends Grayson Allen to you
How is Grayson Allen starting over him? &lt;Didn't watch the game&gt;
"Yep. He has really turned the bucks around.  Brought in a new coach. Carefully brought in excellent pieces. Even this season, bringing in Grayson Allen is a great move.  And as for Masai, Raps have a huge fan base compared to Milwaukee."
"From my point of view along with his extensive tripping history at the time, he arrogantly balled the fuck out against my Badgers while Duke got all of the ""I pay the refs"" calls. Fuck Duke and fuck college Grayson Allen. Bucks' Grayson Allen cool, though."
Damn the Bucks have Grayson Allen. Not a bad pickup.
Grayson Allen and Jordan Nwora
The other 29 teams really let the Bucks get Grayson Allen. League fucked.
I know it‚Äôs only game 1 of 82 but that Nets bench and defense was atrocious and Mills isn‚Äôt gonna go 7/7 from 3 most nights.   Bucks look even hungrier after winning a title. Giannis is just‚Ä¶wow. Grayson Allen is gonna be the underrated move of the off-season
"Grayson Allen was a low key huge pick up for them, dude can shoot and has a mean streak."
"its a good luxury for the Bucks between Grayson Allen and Donte DiVincenzo, they can alternate between both depending on who's shooting/defending well"
League isn't ready for Nwora+Grayson Allen duo
"It's still very *very* early, but it feels like Grayson Allen has been in the team for a couple of years. I really like his energy and attitude. In other news, Giannis is doing Giannis things.  As for the Nets, I don't care if you're missing Michael Jordan himself, you can't be shooting 60% from 3 and barely put up a fight."
grayson allen is a bust
Grayson Allen +25 in 24 minutes.  He is going to be a difference maker this year mark my words
Bucks got some lights out shooters. Still got no clue why Grizzlies let Grayson Allen walk.
Grayson Allen game high plus minus by the way
GIANNIS AND GRAYSON ALLEN OWN NETS   NWORA TOO
Grayson Allen hasn't shot the three ball that well and yet he's absolutely played well this game.  Bucks fans are gonna love him. Miss him already
Grayson Allen is an asset on defense. Damn he‚Äôs got some speed.
Wait Grayson Allen is on the bucks?
Seeing Grayson Allen play with Giannis looks so weird to me
I'm happy that Grayson Allen wasn't on the championship team. There are just some players you don't want to see get a ring.
Thank god I don‚Äôt have to pretend I like Grayson Allen anymore lol
"When did Grayson ""tripping bitches"" Allen get signed to MIL?"
Grayson Allen really looks like Ted Cruz
"Who is the best player out of: Party Mills, Grayson Allen, Bryn Forbes"
they're definitely gonna be a problem this year. Grayson Allen was such a great pickup for them.
Where that Goomby guy that was talking all that talk that Grayson Allen is way better than Landry Shamet.
Grayson Allen?
"No matter what he does, Grayson Allen will always be the POS from Duke"
Wtf I *like* Grayson Allen now
Grayson Allen is the spitting image of Jeremy Renner
Holy shut I forgot Grayson Allen is on the bucks now
"Bucks may have lost a dawg in PJ Tucker, but they gained a DAWG in Grayson Allen"
FUCK GRAYSON ALLEN
I hate Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen is not good
"Mvp: Giannas. Lakers too stacked. Nets durant and harden cancel each other out. Curry-&gt; 2nd  Dpoy: Ben simmons on another team or Bam adebayo   Sixth man: Grayson Allen, Cameron Payne   Roy: Scottie Barnes.   Coach: Hawks coach. Nuggets   Mip: Michael porter,"
Grayson Allen starting lmao
Grayson Allen is starting on the bucks?!
"Grayson Allen is a Buck now? Well if you didn't like them before, you won't like them now..."
There are dozens of us Grayson Allen fans in this thread. Dozens!!!!
Always wonder how it feels like to a player that wasn't on the title team the year before. Like Grayson Allen
Will the Grayson Allen white Dante and Semi look like they can all be effective on the court in a series against the Nets.
If grayson allen fucks up even once be ready for Wisconsinites to fucking lose their collective minds.
Herro (idk if he counts) if he doesn't- Tyrese Haliburton  Jaren Jackson Jr  Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen too. I get they didn't want to pay him but he was a key starter
"It made sense on some level since the Grizzlies had Bane and weren't going to pay Grayson, but I have no idea how we turned the 31st into Allen and 2 more seconds.  That's pure Horst wizardry.  That or the Grizzlies FO paying us back for Jenkins."
"Portis, Augustine, Craig and Tucker came to the Bucks the year they won lmfao. I'm guessing they could see the future?  If anything, they barely did anything in the off-season this year other than extending Grayson Allen"
"Makes sense. But the Bucks have upgraded too with Grayson Allen, Cousins and DiVincenzo still to come back."
"Big Burrito (Marc Gasol, in HS, he didnt like it) -- funny  The Apology (Grayson Allen) -- funny  Grindfather/First Team All Defense (Tony Allen) -- best/descriptive"
"My pleasure. You did all the hard work, I'm just here for the up-toots.   Total attempts is a pretty big part of the picture, especially with the LA fans gushing about Howards 7 total attempts. Do we tell them that Mills hit 10 in a row to start the season?  OP u/johnhenryirons did a list for 100+ attempts,  Patty Mills   Lonzo Ball   Karl-Anthony Towns   Mike Conley   Stephen Curry   Carmelo Anthony   Grayson Allen   Seth Curry   Pat Connaughton   Devin Booker"
"very impressive. posted in another comment, but the top 10 if you went to 100+ attempts as a minimum on the season, it weeds out a lot of people and the list looks like this instead:  Patty Mills   Lonzo Ball   Karl-Anthony Towns   Mike Conley   Stephen Curry   Carmelo Anthony   Grayson Allen   Seth Curry   Pat Connaughton   Devin Booker"
‚ÄúFaked‚Äù   https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2924303-trae-young-posts-video-of-grayson-allen-appearing-to-trip-him-this-gotta-stop  You‚Äôd have to have a learning disability to give the guy with a track record of intentionally tripping people a pass on tripping someone.
"KAT has attempted more than 100 as well. The list of players who have attempted 100 or more is WAY too small this early in the season. If you did 100 or more attempts though, these would be top 10:     Patty Mills   Lonzo Ball   Karl-Anthony Towns   Mike Conley   Stephen Curry   Carmelo Anthony   Grayson Allen   Seth Curry   Pat Connaughton   Devin Booker"
"&gt;Am I tripping  If Grayson Allen is around, probably."
Yeah fuck Grayson Allen. Dude is a punk who doesn‚Äôt belong in the NBA with his bullshit play. He‚Äôs going to hurt someone badly some day Pat Bev style.
&gt;He hasn‚Äôt had any antics or whatever since his rookie year  This is straight up false. He literally went after Trae Young‚Äôs ankles last season.   https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2924303-trae-young-posts-video-of-grayson-allen-appearing-to-trip-him-this-gotta-stop
"Grizz didn't want to extend Jonas (needs the ball too much, too old to contend with the core roster, defensive liability), so they traded him for a worse player, moving up in the draft, and gaining a protected first-rounder in the '22 draft. It wasn't a great deal and looks worse with JV balling, but it at least made sense and isn't the fleecing people claim.  The Grayson Allen trade on the other hand was terrible asset management by the Grizz FO, even if it made sense to trade him in general."
‚ÄúFleece‚Äù. Lol dude we did it on purpose. We couldn‚Äôt afford all the new contracts we were gonna have to sign with JV and Grayson Allen so we had to dump some guys that were balling out and due to get paid soon. Adam‚Äôs has also been great for us. His passing is amazing and it‚Äôs helped Ja get to the point of leading the league in points in the paint.
"Unless Donte's offense is greatly improved when he returns it'll easily be Grayson Allen tbh. He's by far the most versatile on offense and is average enough on defense to cancel it out.    Donte is great on defense for the most part but he's painful on offense a mediocre shooter with questionable decisionmaking when it comes to driving to the rim, solid playmaker and offensive rebounder though."
"Duncan, Joe, Bertans Is any team will willing to pay that much for shooters again? Probably Grayson Allen money"
"Grayson Allen is an elite shooter. He's probably the best shooter the Bucks had in the last 5 years. He's more reliable than Middleton (who can hit the toughest shots and brick 5 open 3s in a row) and can make tougher shots than most guys that shoot well for the Bucks (Portis, Pat) as they can't shoot off the dribble.  Donte is not on his level. he's just okay. Pat used to be just okay too but is shooting much better last 6 months."
"Also his analysis just shows he has no idea what the team looks like in reality. If we adjust for Donte‚Äôs injury last playoffs this is the roster difference:   Lost: Tucker   Gained: Grayson Allen, Donte Divincenzo, Demarcus Cousins, Semi   That‚Äôs the gist of the changes unless I‚Äôm missing anyone. Grayson is okay on defense but including offense is way better than Tucker as an overall package. Donte was injured but is a pretty good defender/playmaker/occasional scorer. Not to mention Connaughton is playing out of his mind this season.   We‚Äôre 9-0 with the trio of Giannis/Khris/Jrue playing this year, and Brook was there for one of those games when we blew out the #1 seed Nets.    It‚Äôs early. But the Bucks are arguably looking *better* than last year with the roster changes. We haven‚Äôt even seen Boogie (or Brook really), if he‚Äôs even slightly okay for 15 minutes/gm then that‚Äôs a huge bench boost"
"PJ was a solid rotation player and all, but holy shit he's overrated. Grayson Allen has already done more than PJ ever did."
&gt;Memphis really gave away Grayson allen   You say this like Allen was a huge contributor  Started 38 games in 2 seasons with the Grizzlies  Though in the minutes he got he did shoot 39-40% from 3
"Grayson ""the Apology"" Allen."
"This was the comment that I thought was gonna be at the top lol. Like I understand what KOC is saying, but w/o context it's super misleading. KOC should've mentioned that Donte is a RFA this summer and I'm assuming he's gonna get like $10M-$15M per year and Grayson already extended for $8.5M per year for the next 2 years.   And assuming Connaughton keeps playing as well as he has, he's probably gonna reject his player option for next season which is for $5.7M and try to get a longer contract that's closer to $10M per year(if I'm him I'm at least asking for Grayson Allen money lol). In conclusion, starting next season those 3 players combined per year value is gonna be in the $30M-$40M range easily lol"
Yeah can we not be comparing Grayson Allen to Joe Harris?!? foh
Grayson Allen was straight up theft by the bucks lol. I can't believe we have a great shooter for that amount.
Am I tripping or didn‚Äôt everyone hate Grayson Allen a year or two ago lmao
Lol I'd want that to happen just to see how r/nba reacts.  Would their hatred of Duke players and specifically Ted Cruz looking Grayson Allen trump their hatred of the Nets.  Like I want a scenario where Harden hooks Allen to foul bait which directly leads to Allen tripping him purposely just to see r/nba explode.
Duke Grayson Allen will return to trip all the Nets in transition
It makes sense then if they were trying to package Dillon Brooks and Grayson Allen for a better wing - they need one to pair with Ja for the future.  Ziaire Williams will hopefully be that but he's raw as hell. Memphis traded up in the draft with the JV trade but apparently they were hoping for either Giddey or Wagner.
I'm so stunned at the Grayson Allen thing. I did not see this coming.
"I mean career wise Harris and Robinson are far better shooters (AKA more proven commodities)  than Connaughton and DiVincenzo, and Grayson Allen is still on rookie contract."
"Memphis really gave away Grayson allen and Valanciunas in the same offseason, and there were rumours about trading Dillon brooks lmao"
good for the bucks and glwd they entrusted in that grayson allen kid too hes been a pleasant and key player in their success
"I think there's a certain amount of truth to that. A lot of fans don't want to admit to themselves that they sometimes cheer more for the white guy, even when it doesn't make sense. For instance, our sub LOVES Luka Garza. Never seen a pick in the 50s who can't play defense get showered with so much love so quickly lmao.  But in this case, I think it has more to do with the history of the Morris twins, and the fact that Markief clearly instigated the shoving match.  Also remember, everybody hated on Grayson Allen for his dirty stuff too, and Kelly Olynyk. Like I said, I don't think you're coming out of left field with your assessment, but it's definitely not a constant either."
"You've got Grayson Allen playing the best basketball of his career, and still need to re-integrate DiVincenzo into the line-up, and you've got Jrue excelling at his natural position, coming off a title and on a hot winning streak. Why would you push Jrue to the 2 to take on a damaged John Wall, when you could just win without him?"
Lmao a Bucks fan saying this shit. The Bucks miss 3 starters per game on average. We were literally starting Thanasis and Pat at C for some games. The only legit NBA player on his team was Grayson Allen for a couple of weeks.  He's had a worse team than Curry so far this season and it really isn't close.
"You can tell that the team is still very much a work in progress. Bobby is getting used to his new role as a rebounder, Pat is great, but I wish he would slash more often, and gRAYson Allen should be moving around all the time (pin-downs, DHOs, etc.)."
"He should average 11x 3PA. This might sound like a lot, but it is. gRAYson Allen and Planet Pat are incredible from 3 this season, and so is Bobby (BOBBY!)."
gRAYson Allen should take more shots
And move Grayson Allen to the bench? I think not üò§
"The existence of Grayson Allen dickriders is puzzling to me.  But no, that's definitely not true, he's been a dirty piece of shit in games I've watched and I don't watch other teams' summer league games and I *definitely* don't *ever* watch college ball games."
Grayson Allen has about as much of a shot at making the ASG as I do lmfao
look up grayson allen dirty plays
"just gotta get in a ""fuck grayson allen"" in this thread"
That Grayson Allen sure is a killer. A zodiac killer.
I fucks with Grayson Allen heavy   Even when he was considered dirty   Dude literally gives no fucks &amp; you need that energy on a competitive roster   His fit on the bucks is masterful tbh
They let PJ Tucker walk because they were cheap. But the Grayson Allen move kinda equal it out to be a good off-season I guess
"Id say the same for Grayson Allen.  Right now he‚Äôs at 42.2% from the field on 7.7 3PA per game.  Grayson is good, but he‚Äôs getting so many open looks off of Giannis gravity."
Grayson Allen rubs be wrong
Yeah I‚Äôm really not sure how you can argue anyone else this year.   Steph‚Äôs got 92 3PM on 42% shooting  Buddys got 81 3PM on 40%  Next up is Grayson Allen and CJ McCollum with 63  3PM on 42 &amp; 40% respectively.  Pretty big gap between the top two and the rest of the league
Grizz fans really hate Trae for some reason. I guess because he called out Grayson Allen for being dirty? IDK. But I suppose dropping 31/10 in 3 quarters isn't going to help.   I do hope Ja is alright.
Anything to fit the narrative. Grizz fans have had some weird bone to pick since the Grayson Allen incident.
I had no idea Grayson Allen played for the Bucks.  Has he matured past his douchey Duke days?
He‚Äôs not on the jazz anymore but when Grayson Allen was on the court i cheered for the other team!
So bizarre.   The difference between this roster and last years roster isn‚Äôt much different. A full season of JJJ and adams for valancunis and Grayson Allen. On paper they should be at the same level defensively
Grayson Allen????????????????????
"Drop Grayson Allen and I'll agree with that.  I was talking about that with my brother-in-law recently. He's very, very sad about the Bucks having Allen, because he loves Giannis and really liked the Bucks but he haaaaates Grayson Allen. He doesn't like Bobby Portis either, but we have Draymond so call that a wash.  Outside of Draymond, the Warriors really don't have an unlikable player.  (I like Draymond. I am a Warriors fan. I accept this opinion is extremely not universal.)  The Bucks are mostly a really likable team apart from First Team All Chode Grayson Allen and teammate-puncher Bobby Portis, and those two being there does make me sad too."
"They've collected some really hateable players, while not having anyone lovable enough to offset that.  Like, the Bucks have absolute tools like Grayson ""literally everything about the way he plays and his Ted Cruz face"" Allen and Bobby ""How About I Punch This Teammate"" Portis, but no-one hates the Bucks because they still have Giannis and everyone loves Giannis.  Whereas the Heat have allowed their team's leader to become Jimmy Butler, who seems to be incapable of just being professional about literally anything. He's all about the petty aggression... so long he's at a safe distance.  See: mouthing off from the bench but not, like, when he was anywhere near Jokic after the incident with Morris, and then holding photo shoots in the corridor knowing they'd get cleared out of their before they so much as laid eyes on the Nuggets."
I don‚Äôt really see how they got better in the long term either. Unless you‚Äôre just really high on Zaire Williams.  JV ended up signing a super reasonable extension. They gave away Grayson Allen who has been solid.
Wow Grayson Allen has been a bucket for them
"I‚Äôve been punched in the stomach in the open floor away from the ball. I was pissed but I knew the guy in general wasn‚Äôt a dirty player. It‚Äôs about reputation, and Stewart has just as many dirty clips being in the league 2 years as LeBron has in 19, and I think that says something.  Edit: and I believe Grayson Allen has that poor reputation. LeBron has his shitty moments and I think he‚Äôs a Chinese puppet sometimes who needs to stay off the mic. I‚Äôm just trying to say going so far to call him a dirty player seems wrong."
"that because people like Giannis, not because they hate the Suns.  Some people dislike Chris Paul, but the rest of the team is fine.  The hatred for Paul isn't any more than the hatred for Westbrook, Harden, Draymond, Pat Beverly, Kelly Olynick, both of the Morris brothers, Jokic, Paul George, Grayson Allen, etc.  If you really think the Suns are hated like the Lebron/Westbrook/Dwight/Rondo Lakers or the Kyrie/Durant/Harden Nets or the Draymond/bandwagon fans Warriors , you are delusional"
"Middleton usually shoots ours so it depends how strictly you wanna define ‚Äústar‚Äù I guess, but if he‚Äôs not on the floor Grayson Allen is the second choice ahead of Giannis or Jrue."
"Imagine getting to have Grayson Allen, Bobby Portis, *and* Pat Connaughton as players on your basketball team."
"Bucks and Wisconsin Badgers fan here. Grayson Allen was the catalyst for Duke‚Äôs second half comeback in the national championship game a few years ago. Whenever he hits a three now, my celebration is a *silent* fist pump."
Grayson Allen won a national championship his freshmen year.   Then went on to average 17 PPG on 60% true shooting for the next three years.   He got drafted somewhere where he didn't really fit. And now he's thriving in Milwaukee.  Really hard to say Coach K did a bad job there.
Well what about Grayson Allen? he had 4yrs to develop and when he got to the league he was a project 15th man.
Grayson Allen.   I want him to choke.....  HARD.  Any team he gets traded to (sorry Bucks fans) i want him to choke at a crucial moment.  I essentially want him to pull off a Ben Simmons.
"I‚Äôd say Grayson Allen but I don‚Äôt know how old he is, his face looks 13"
"LMAO revisionist history. If you ask r/NBA who are the dirtiest players, 3 out of the top 10 would be Kelly Olynyk and Grayson Allen and Zaza Pachulia. Why are you making shit up?"
Grayson Allen was just an avid watcher of LeBron
Grayson Allen
grayson allen (just turned 26)
 &gt;Wow man. You got me. I totally inflated it by .04 on his TS because that definitely matters in regards to the point as a whole. It was a genuine mistake. Still changes absolutely nothing about Lavine‚Äôs dominance last season.   You inflated it by 4% not .04 which is absolutely a big deal. It makes all the difference in winning games.  &gt;I hate to break it to you but 3 point shooting DOES matter in a 3 point dominated league. Are you forgetting how it hindered Giannis and the Bucks for two playoff runs? And Lavine has teams running a box and one this season just to stop him. Both him and Giannis require that attention. I‚Äôll let you know when Lavine smokes the Bucks in the playoffs. Fucking play in team Bucks right now lmao.  You're delusional if you think Lavine requires the same amount of attention as Giannis.  3-point shooting is important but also replacable. Grayson Allen and Duncan Robinson aren't exactly winning MVPs out here.  Also how about you wait untill the Bulls even make it out of the first round (it's been a while lol) before you start shit talking the reigning champs. We got a ring and you boys haven't even made the playoffs in 5 years.
"Grayson Allen, Kelly Oubre,"
Maybe Grayson Allen a few years ago
I remember Grayson Allen had a game winner on a similar no-call against UVA--I couldn't tell in real time at all but you could see it in slow motion  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBm6mX4cUpw
I never thought I could appreciate Grayson Allen after him helping Duke beat the Badgers in the Championship while I was in school but this season is quickly changing that.
God damn Grayson Allen has turned into one of the biggest steals of the season. Just absolutely shooting the lights out and playing smart basketball.
Grayson Allen?
"With Pat's outside shot getting even better, Bobby, and now Grayson Allen this is a Bucks team that could potentially shoot up to 35% from deep in the playoffs."
"He's not like 80's Pistons dirty, but yes, Lebron's taken little cheap shots like this his entire career. Someone else in here said it was like Grayson Allen which is a pretty apt comparison."
"i wasnt implying that he is loved for being white, i was just saying that he is a fan favorite even among fans of other teams and neutrals and that‚Äôs why he doesn‚Äôt get labeled as a dirty player that often. whereas kelly olynyk and like you said, grayson allen get frequently (and fairly) labeled as dirty players because, well, they are dirty players. but they‚Äôre not as loved nor as good as jokic, which both attribute to their widespread criticism."
"Pretty sure the love for Jokic comes more from him being foreign, not him being white. Foreign players are pretty untouchable when it comes to criticism. I mean people will still consider Grayson Allen to be super dirty even though he hasn't had a notable incident since college or maybe his rookie year."
For some reason I doubt a Grayson Allen compilation is getting 20k upvotes in this sub my guy
"Steph: yanks out his mouthpiece and throws it so hard it decapitates opponent  Lebron: takes a big bite out of a ""Taco Tuesday ‚Ñ¢"" taco and the taco sprays highly acidic hot sauce on the opponent resulting in their skin melting off their face  Draymond: Kicks you so hard in the balls that they shoot out of the opponent's mouth.  He grabs them out of mid-air and and throws them in the opponent's gaping mouth, causing them to choke and keel over  Melo: Swishes a 3, cocks back his three fingers and blows his own head off  Grayson Allen:  Does 10 leg sweeps in a row"
I‚Äôve never seen that one before. Imagine if that exact play had been a Morris twin? Or Grayson Allen?
It was Grayson Allen-esque
The Grizz are low key our Achilles heel. Last year it was Morant and Grayson Allen lighting us up and this year it was Desmond bane and Morant. I kinda don‚Äôt wanna face them
"I'm not arguing for Lebron. I'm explaining why (potentially) a player who had (again, likely) more than anyone's fair share of dirty plays against him, because he's everyone's measuring stick and was the best player on the planet is also likely to have his fair share of mental blowups. Again, not justifying it or calling it normal, but trying to rationalize it... and again, because he's Lebron and not Grayson Allen we're talking about it here, and why this explanation likely gets downvoted another 21 times... because it's hate on Lebron day."
If it was Grayson Allen it'd be on the front page already
"It‚Äôs not that we didn‚Äôt draft MPJ, we should have, but the medical issue was a legit reason not too. It‚Äôs that we drafted Jerome Robinson over guys like Grayson Allen, Lonnie Walker, Donte DiVincezo, Kevin Huerter etc"
Grayson Allen trade is better
"The Grizzlies made the aforementioned trade and traded Grayson Allen for Sam Merrill and two second-round picks, which is rough.  Allen is starting, averaging 15.1 points amd shooting 42.3% from 3."
Grayson allen was acquired for essentially nothing
I‚Äôm not worried when Donte and Brook come back we will have Bobby and Grayson Allen coming of the bench with Hill   I like those players to deal with any second unit
Yea Bane and Melton are a big part of why they traded Grayson Allen too. Lot of really good guards in Memphis.
"Duke JJ was a demon. I have a personal bias towards him because I'm a duke fan but. For some reason with me I always seem to like players who are kinda hated. I love Grayson Allen and people hated him forever at duke, same with KG because of all of his trash talk"
lol and what's DiVincenzo ? Jordan reborn ? He's not even as good as Grayson Allen has been so far.
Can he shoot though? Gimme Grayson Allen.
"Oh okay, I'll start. Well according to my eye-test, Grayson Allen is the best shooter ever."
Bucks have 2 very friendly contracts in Bobby Portis and Grayson allen
Pat Connaughton and Grayson Allen are both on such low contracts for what they contribute  &amp;#x200B;  Absolute steals by Horst
One of those games again.  **Expected (most likely final) Lineups:**    [](/CLE)Cavaliers (4-4) | [](/MEM)Grizzlies (2-5) ---|--- Collin Sexton |  Tyus Jones Cedi Osman| Grayson Allen Isaac Okoro | Dillon Brooks Larry Nance | Kyle Anderson A.

Grayson Allen
Nobody should ever start Grayson Allen
tbh I don't think you can recover from being ratio'd by Grayson Allen
Trae hasn‚Äôt been the same since Grayson Allen ratio‚Äôd him on twitter
"No no, this dude should definitely keep starting Grayson Allen."
Your problem is starting Grayson Allen at all.
"i‚Äôm going to take the blame on this one. I start Ja in fanduel, he hurts his ankle. i start Grayson Allen, he gets hurt. today i started Fultz."
Grayson Allen. Dude should have played in the 80/90s when people actually had brawls over petty shit on the court.
Yeah I‚Äôm aware and I‚Äôm not a Grayson Allen fan by any means but he donated tens of thousands of meals during the pandemic on a rookie contract. Pat Bev is just a dick
Grayson Allen is maybe worse than PatBev.
Don‚Äôt you dare put grayson Allen in the same sentence as Pat Bev.
Pat bev aka the black Grayson Allen
"Patrick Beverley and Grayson Allen deserve career ending injuries.  Normally I‚Äôd never wish an injury on a player, but fuck these two. They‚Äôre out there giving Zero fucks about others‚Äô careers and health."
This.....moves like this one or the Grayson Allen trip ruin the integrity of the game and set a bad example for the next generation of ball players. It sparks the idea of getting away with dirty play and should not be tolerated.  Fugg pat bev
Pat Bev. Grayson Allen is actually a good guy
‚ÄúHe should replace Grayson Allen entirely soon‚Äù  That‚Äôs not something to be particularly proud of lol. Grayson is doo doo
fuck Grayson Allen!
"Grayson Allen is a bitch. The NBA should just ban him from the league before he injures someone for real. He's an average player, they wouldn't be losing anything."
Of course it's grayson allen
"Grayson Allen, professional little shit"
Grayson Allen has a top 5 punchable face
&gt; It‚Äôs different if Rivers didn‚Äôt slow down at all and bulldozed Trae.   Like when Grayson Allen blew by Trae Young and he did exactly that?
I don't like him because I remember him being a dirty player. Grayson Allen is def. a dirty player but he's never broken anyone's nose. He even has multiple YT videos of compilations of him being dirty. But Dwade tends to get a pass because he's also a very good basketball player.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJmyMfpbsMY&amp;feature=emb_title
Luka too but Grayson Allen ain't popular enough to get that hatred package.  He's gonna start off w/ the smaller Zaza hatred package.
"You're joking, right?  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2019/7/12/20691683/grayson-allen-tripping-nba-summer-league-duke-grizzlies-video"
"I dont understand unironically rooting against players (other than dirty players, but even then i dont root  AGAINST them, i am just apathetic when something goes bad ahem Grayson Allen)   But i DO like to trash talk players that NBA made me hate - Luka and Ja in particular. I think they are highly entertaining but I also want the Hawks to succeed more than them, naturally"
"It's not proportional though. Pat Beverly is hated for a good reason, same for Grayson Allen"
"Grayson Allen, Kevin porter Jr, and Tyler Johnson"
Idk man theres just something about those guys that i really identify with. Oh Grayson Allen and Sam Dekker too!
"nah, he immediately jumped straight to the ""you just don't like grayson allen"" defense lol  i didn't even see who committed the foul at first, but that wasn't a run-of-the-mill foul"
"stop making assumptions.  i don't particularly care for grayson allen any more than the next guy, but you're being a massive homer by acting like that was a clean foul lol. don't matter who did it, that was shady"
Grayson Allen needs to get an elbow to the face. He's always dirty
"I know right, this sub is filled with some of the most sensitive people on reddit. If I had a penny for every time Ive read that kind of whiny ass ""I cAnT BeLiEvE yAlL aRe SaYiNG tHis ShiT"" comments, Id be rich enough to buy this website and ban the crybabies. Like look at that thread where Grayson Allen posted a funny twitter comeback, half the comment section was filled with shit like ""OMG I JUST CANT BELIEVE this sub is saying positive things about this ankle-destroying MONSTER, I didnt know there were so many WHITE SUPREMASISTS on this sub. Im actually SHAKING rn."""
Ok yeah it‚Äôs probably both. Anyone know if one came before the other? I hadn‚Äôt heard it used to mean a reply got more likes than the original tweet until the Trae Young-Grayson Allen spat. And then it just happened again in this thread a week later.
Grayson Allen watches political ads in his free time
Steph been watchin too many Grayson Allen highlights.
Imagine losing to the Grizzlies missing Grayson Allen...
Dude has been shit talking and staring dudes down since he was a rookie.  And he‚Äôs a bitch.  Grayson Allen barely trips him and he cries to social media.  Three reasons now.
"Shit talker? Only shit he‚Äôs talked has been to Grayson Allen, who is the most well known scrub in the league bc of how dirty he plays. His foul baiting can be prevented if the opponents don‚Äôt follow him so closely off pick and rolls, and o many other elite scorers do it. Kyrie I‚Äôm literally did the move trae is shit on for tonight, I doubt Steve Nash will express his disgust over it when his own player does it successfully."
&gt;*Do you also love pat bev diving at knees tryna injure guys or Grayson Allen tripping players?*  This is why BI was pissed though. Harden elbowed him in the face. Even Giannis will get mad if a player is attacking his legs/face all night and it doesn't get called.
You loved that shit? It was dirty af and potentially could have had devastating consequences   Do you also love pat bev diving at knees tryna injure guys or Grayson Allen tripping players?
I‚Äôm glad it was Grayson Allen...lol

Who could've predicted it would be Grayson Allen again? Dirty player
Why is a thug like Grayson Allen still in the league?
Grayson Allen moment
Grayson Allen so dirty he gave Lowry back spasms smh.
The union isn't supposed to support certain players more than others. LeBron matters as much to the union as Grayson Allen.  Can you see why unions died in America?
Grayson Allen.
I disagree because mario hezonja and grayson allen are still in the league
I can't believe Grayson Fucking Allen has fanboys now. What a timeline.
There're dirty players and there's [Grayson Allen.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcEq7xhxD4g)
"My opinion is unchanged, NBA would be a better place if Grayson Allen is kicked out of it (due to deliberately tripping people and similar)."
Why do people hate Grayson Allen?
Bulls fans loathe Trae Young  and Grayson Allen
When you put it like that: fuck Grayson Allen.

"Grayson Allen had more 40 point games as a rookie than Kobe, Curry, Hakeem, LeBron, Duncan, Durant, Malone, Robinson, Barkley, Garnett, Dirk, Shaq and West combined."
Grizzly fans defending Grayson Allen has made me hate a franchise I once loved
"Conversely, I love seeing people acknowledge their flaws, work to move past them, and become healthier and better people as a result. Anyone that thinks Grayson is the same person he was at Duke is sorely mistaken at this point. I will fully admit that I hate crappy people succeeding and was highly disappointed when Allen joined the Grizz roster, but he has 100% changed my mind."
Grayson Allen is far from a no name lmao
yeah I don‚Äôt really pay attention to grayson allen drama  clearly nobody else does either because this thread is just like a dozen grizz fans circlejerking by themselves
Grayson Allen is ready for white boy summer
"The last time Grayson Allen tripped someone was Duke v Elon, December 2016.   In other words, the last time he tripped someone Obama was still president."
Grayson Allen is a hooper!
"Grayson Allen is quite notorious, would not consider him a no name"
If Grayson Allen was kidnapped by ISIS I‚Äôd root for ISIS.
Grayson Allen seems like the sort of guy who scrolls through twitter reading his hate mail before games to hype himself up.
I hate seeing Grayson Allen succeed and that is the only player I have ever said that about.
"Grayson Allen is actually NBA starters level, /r/collegebasketball in shambles"
GRAYSON ALLEN !!!!!!!!!

Grayson Allen redemption tour
I don‚Äôt think this sub thinks about Grayson Allen at all
I would kill to have Grayson Allen though
Grayson Allen
"&gt;He should have been guarding him much tighter  So that Dame can jump into him and flop his way to game-winning FTs, which he's 90% at and only has to make 1 of?  Iirc from the Grayson Allen thread, the chances of a 90% FT shooter missing both are less than 1%. As great a shooter as Dame is, his chances of making a 37-footer are not 99%."
"First I don‚Äôt think it was intentional, but it looks awkward the way sumner follows through on his pass like a baseball pitch with that leg whipping around toward Donovan.  Even if it doesn‚Äôt make contact with Donovan it made him react and come down differently than if the leg hadn‚Äôt been there. Again, I don‚Äôt think it was intentional but it was awkward looking.  Also, if it were someone with more of a history of ‚Äúdirty‚Äù play a la Grayson Allen, zaza pachulia type, maybe even draymond then people would be saying it was intentional so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that crazy."
i guarantee if this was grayson allen this sub would have a raging boner rn
Lots of folks wanna blame Grayson Allen for the loss against the Mavs but Dillon Brooks shot us out of that game.
"may i suggest... Patrick Beverley??????? Or Grayson Allen, the man who puts his pants on one toe at a time?"
Won't be a round 2 for the Jazz if Grayson Allen plays. Fucking legend
&gt;	Grayson Allen purely based on the fact that he looks like ~~Ted Cruz~~ Grayson Allen   FTFY
I opened the thread hoping Grayson Allen was at the top.   was not disappointed
Grayson Allen purely based on the fact that he looks like Ted Cruz
Grayson Allen if u also take into account his past
"I haven‚Äôt either but for some reason it makes so much sense. If you told me Grayson Allen was Ted Cruz‚Äôs bastard son, I‚Äôd believe you."
Fuck Grayson Allen.  Al my homies hate Grayson Allen.
Grayson Allen looks like the villain in a Spike Lee movie.  Has a few dirty plays.
I don‚Äôt think you need to have a good reputation - I think it‚Äôs just that your reputation has to be harmed   But I do love shitting on Grayson Allen
No one going to talk about how Grayson Allen is actually an 83% free throw shooter? Not sure where 91 came from. Obviously still pretty improbable though.
Haha. Fuck Grayson Allen
"That‚Äôs true, but it also needs to be false. You also need to have a good enough reputation for it to be harmed by the false things said about you, and I don't think anyone in the league has a worse reputation than Grayson Allen."
we see you Grayson Allen burner account.  don't get KD'd on this one.
Grayson Allen hate supersedes all
&gt; Damn that must‚Äôve really really hurt. I‚Äôm sorry. I hope you‚Äôre okay  Me watching Grayson Allen choke
"over a year ago.  We had ZBO who literally choked a guy on national television.  We had Matt Barnes who got into a fight with Derek Fisher  We had Tony Allen who literally got into a fight with teammates.  We are actually quite grounded and people thinking Grayson's ""fight"" in summer league was something is hilarious to me.   We are more accepting of people and when that gets in the way of people wanting to hate, then we get called delusional. I am in no way trying to stop you from feeling hatred, but the fact that you need to bash Griz fans while you're hating on Grayson might show you where you're really at."
Grayson Allen had a really good game up until he missed both FTs to seal it.
"Watched this live:     * Grayson Allen misses two free throws that could've iced the game * I'm thinking ""lol no way..."" * Luka goes ahead and decides to do this * ^(wtf)"
"All these 90% FT shooters (Grayson Allen) can't make one from the charity stripe when it counts most... Luka is out here dropping game winning, 3 point floaties."
Taj Gibson hit a full court shot yesterday but I wouldn't call him a sharpshooter. Hitting one game winner against the grizzlies in the regular season after Grayson Allen misses 2 FTs doesn't make Luka a clutch player
Taj Gibson hit a full court shot yesterday but I wouldn't call him a sharpshooter. Imagine hitting one game winner against the grizzlies in the regular season after Grayson Allen misses 2 FTs and calling yourself a clutch player for it
"How the fuck is this dude a 90% FT shooter?? He missed that couple too, and those didn't even look close. So I've seen 4 Grayson Allen free-throws in my life so far, and he bricked every single one"
 &gt;He intentionally stepped on Traes ankles  You're not a mind reader and you don't know whether it was intentional or not.  Maybe Trae should stop committing dirty fouls on Grayson and I might have a little sympathy for poor baby having his toe stepped on.   Trae has shoved Allen in the back multiple times in game. The guy is a joke.
"Yes, and that‚Äôs just because everyone loves to hate Trae. Let that be LBJ or Luka and Grayson getting death threats and shit. I love the Grizzlies team but fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck Grayson Allen and Dillon Brooks"
"All because Grayson Allen, a 90% free throw shooter, clanked both free throws to seal it just prior."
Bro Grayson Allen is literally nothing like an autistic person

Trae Young is completely responsible for every single incident between him and Grayson.   Dude tries a ripthrough and then shoved Allen when they got tangled up.   Or Allen beats him off the dribble and then Trae shoved him in the back.
I appreciate every opportunity I get to meme on Grayson Allen.
Anybody know of Andy Milonakis? Why does Grayson Allen remind me of him...on the face?
"Grayson Allen, a 91% dick, misses the two potential game-sealing free throws with 2.2 seconds left, making the NBA world bask in delicious schadenfreude."
Good. It's always fuck Grayson Allen. Dirty ass player
Grayson Allen....    both were in and out
"Actually, I assumed they were Memphis broadcasters because they are not the regular celtics people. I realize now that, this being summer league, they could be from either side, just not the regular season broadcast team.  That said, they seem to know a lot about Grayson Allen."
"Grayson Allen is the zodiac killer, confirmed."
 Why is Grayson Allen hated? I wanna join on the hate so bad. LET ME IN
"I mean, tell me Grayson Allen is a good human and keep a straight face"
"Grayson Allen thinks the Paris Agreement is specifically about Paris, and not Pittsburgh"
"I called this, not the one foot 3pt but, Grayson Allen 2-3yr player at the line to hit go ahead buckets for the win, i guaranteed there was 1 miss but the second too, exactly what I told my stepdad I expected and after first missed. Mavs rebound that should‚Äôve been a foul if TO wasn‚Äôt so anticipated they practically called it off the rim. Dallas almost never goes for overtime, doncic is always drawn up to hit the three over a screen and inbound pass win or lose in a game like that is mark cubin and Mavericks culture at this point.   No money on the line but i wish I was recording from the Grayson Allen foul just to have record of what I predicted/manifested to my step pops."
The whole sequence leading up to this was insane. Especially Grayson Allen missing both free throws when he's a 91% free throw shooter and was having a great game. I did NOT expect that.  And Luka hit that 3 with a floater with the ball leaving his hand at 0.1 second left.
Fuck Grayson Allen. Was so excited to have someone I saw play against my high school be good and then he had to be a giant douche.
Fuck Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen missed those free throws because of the space time continuum. Luka already made that winning shot in the continuum. So he had to have missed them in order for it to have happened right after. Sometimes free throws are not free will.
"Yes, fuck Grayson Allen."
Any day I get to see Grayson Allen unhappy is a good day.
Fuck Ted Cruz all my homies hate Grayson Allen
"You love to see it, fuck Grayson Allen"
It's grayson allen  Gives you a great game but takes it away with a shitty ending
What were the odds on 40/10/10? I got burned by Grayson Allen missing free throws.. can‚Äôt stand that guy..
"But honestly, without a doubt Ted Cruz &gt; Grayson Allen"
Who are you more mad at? Luka Doncic for hitting the hail mary or Grayson Allen for choking the two free throws?
This is the Grayson Allen content I want to see üêêüôèüèΩüôèüèΩ thank you luka for shitting on this bastard
Anyone else notice Grayson Allen‚Äôs goofy-ass smile after he missed both of those free throws? If I was his teammate or a Grizzlies fan that would have made me furious. As if anyone needed another reason to hate Grayson Allen.
"He doesn't owe anyone an apology except for the people he tripped. So that is what it is. Other than that in the NBA he has had tangles with Trae Young (someone who notoriously hunts fouls and has beef with Allen) and he had that bizzare outburst in summer league. Everything else is a reputation issue from college.   If you're gonna talk shit about someone on the Grizzlies being dirty, maybe turn your attention to Jonas? He's had multiple 'dirty' plays this season: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iniy2t9K9vI  This video for the 2019/20 season has three grizzlies plays and Grayson isn't on any of them. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3-FRL4TiXc"
"Fuck Grayson ""Ted Cruz"" Allen."
Why don't people like Grayson Allen?
I used to wish for the NBA to drop Grayson Allen. Now I'm happy he's still around so I can see him fail. What a prick.
Anybody have a screen grab of Grayson Allen laughing on the sideline after tricking those two freethrows to seal the game?
I've never seen Ted Cruz and Grayson Allen in the same room
Grayson Allen is the villain we all need
"Yo, I heard there's a fuck Grayson Allen party happening here?"
I regularly boo Grayson Allen at home games
"As he stepped up to the line, Grayson Allen had flashbacks to his tripping incidents at Duke"
Odds are higher when you factor in grayson allen
Grayson Allen is the Zodiac Killer.
"I couldn't care less about Grayson Allen, but this tweet made me gain a ton of respect for Ja"
No idea what you're talking about but it sounds like it's still bothering you. No Hawks fan has a problem with Ja or his playing style or whatever you're on about. It's obviously Grayson Allen
They should banish Grayson Allen from the nba.
HARP leader list goes like   1. Grayson Allen  2. PatBev  3. Kyle Kuzma
Pops Mensah Bonsu  DJ Mbenga  Luc Richard Mbah a Moute  Bismack Biyombo  Grayson Allen
"nah, grayson 'ted cruz' allen is the winner of that award by a mile"
Grayson Allen.
Knew Grayson Allen was winning this one when it happened live.
"Not a bad list, I'd replace Ingles with Grayson Allen but otherwise spot on"
"Hahahahhaa classy individual I‚Äôm sure Kevin love, jokic and Grayson Allen would‚Äôve responded with supreme class ‚úäüèª‚úäüèª‚úäüèª"
Grayson Allen
I really wish I could root for the Grizzlies but fuck Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen too
"2018 because it has the future hall of Famer Luka, JJJ, Trae, MPJ, Ayton, Bridges and the best of all Grayson Allen."
"I've joked with my friends about wearing my Tony Allen jersey to the games with a post it note 3 on the front and back.  (TA wore 9, Grayson Allen wears 3)"
Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen    Kelly Olynyk    Zaza Pachulia     Draymond Green    Meyers Leonard
"Grayson Allen is the best scorer in the league  He‚Äôs averaging only 11.5 points a game  You‚Äôre a stat guy, I get it"
"Yeah this is a big nephew take. He‚Äôs better at literally everything except for shooting. Their play making is absolutely not on par and it‚Äôs not even really that close.   I‚Äôm convinced that you probably don‚Äôt watch the Grizz play that often but Ja‚Äôs vision and playmaking is actually unreal for a young guard. The only reason he‚Äôs not averaging more assists is because JJJ has missed the whole season, and the Grizzlies outside shooting is completely fucked without him.   They basically only have Grayson Allen and Desmond Bane as reliable volume 3pt shooters."
Grayson Allen
i love all grizzlies except grayson allen. I especially love me some JJJ
We specifically challenged to have it reviewed and changed from defensive foul to offensive foul...  Do you remember when the ball clearly went out of bounds on the Grizzlies yet you guys maintained possession? How about when Grayson Allen got 3 FT and Vlatko never even touched him?  Exactly lol.... it went both ways
You love to see this happen to Grayson Allen
Ill take a Grayson Allen lowlight anyday.  Someone should have tripped his ass too.
Grayson Allen pushing rope with 2 min to go in the 4th
They really put the play in where he slapped the shit out of Grayson Allen on the fast break and didn‚Äôt get called for it. Love to see it.
"You had me at ""Grayson Allen blows"""
Grayson Allen.
"Grayson Allen low lights, I'm here for it"
Nothing puts a smile on my face quite like seeing Grayson Allen get embarrassed. Nature is healing itself
How tf is Grayson Allen trash? You‚Äôd think he‚Äôd average 5 points a game on 50 ts with the way people talk about him
"I hate Grayson Allen so much that even watching a clip of bad things happening to him makes me angry. The best kind of angry, but still."
Kinda funny how nba fans want players who play dirty and physical but hate guy like grayson allen
Remember when grayson Allen missed that dunk at the end of the 1st overtime that would have put the Grizzlies up 5 with 50 seconds left and probably would have won them the game?  That was awesome
"Definitely is. Jokic does a small jump towards him before realizing he can't legally contest, but its too late by then and he bumps allen. At the very least Grayson isn't coming up ""soft"" he gets bumped legal or not.. The human body doesn't just move like that."
It was the Grayson Allen show. Nuggets fans had a good laugh.
Like Jokic was trying to get Grayson Allen switched onto him. That‚Äôs just offense
I like Grayson Allen but you can't be upset for people disliking him. He's probably the dirtiest player that college basketball has seen since a lot of this sub started following basketball (myself included)
Grayson Allen is terrible. Why does he get minutes?
Is that Grayson Allen? Then f*ck Grayson Allen
Nah it‚Äôs Grayson Allen
Jokic vs. Grayson Allen. Battle of the century
"Yeah they have such an underrated supporting cast. Morants obviously the head of the snake but he's definitely getting help from some of the other guys.  Also, did Grayson Allen enter a hyperbolic time chamber and train? He's so much better than I last saw him play lol"
Just google ‚ÄúGrayson Allen‚Äù and you‚Äôll see plenty of reasons
I hate Grayson Allen but the Grizzlies did well getting him for basically nothing. Shame he‚Äôs such an unlikable prick.
&gt;Grayson Allen is so incredibly trash   Casual alert
"It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs been crazy impactful since coming back and like you said they are made of role players, but they probably have some of the most elite role players. Brandon Clarke, Tyus Jones, DeAnthony Melton, Desmond Bane, Kyle Anderson, Grayson Allen, Dillon Brooks. Have all been doing their thang this season."
Grayson Allen is 3rd in the NBA in 3pt makes in April
"Ja played well, definitely was forcing it at times (3 lost dribbles late in the 4th and that weird attempt at a game winner) but holy crap they need to get him some help. Haven't watched much of the Grizzlies but he should not have to depend on Grayson Allen that much.   A 2OT game in Denver is always going to be tough on the opponent. Great game"
Grayson Allen choked big time at the end
"Grayson Allen missing the game winning shot in regulation, the game sealing dunk in OT, and the game tying shot in 2 OT. This is what we live for"
"Grayson Allen, whatcha doin my guy?  Campazzo bouncing the ball off his butt to give us possession was huge insult to injury."
"Grayson Allen really reliving his Duke days by making an ass out of himself, you love to see it."
who gave Grayson Allen a green light?
I don‚Äôt know how many of y‚Äôall are watching this game but we refuse to win this. The number of times someone has blown an easy possession trying to be the hero (cough cough Ja Morant) or make the highlight play (cough cough Grayson Allen) in OT is the reason we‚Äôre in 2OT right now
I don‚Äôt know how many of y‚Äôall are watching this game but we *refuse* to win this. The number of times someone has blown an easy possession trying to be the hero (*cough cough Ja Morant*) or make the highlight play (*cough cough Grayson Allen*) in OT is the reason we‚Äôre in 2OT right now
Grayson ‚ÄúI was trying to dunk on a 9‚Äô hoop‚Äù Allen may have fucked the Grizz
"Grayson Allen is a certified choker, and I LOVE it."
Grayson Allen had such a good look on that corner three
Grayson Allen chokes again
"So because it‚Äôs Grayson Allen, the ref is allowed to punish him because the ref screwed up?  Do these refs refuse to consider that they‚Äôre wrong?  Particularly when Jokic quite literally tried to foul and claimed it. It‚Äôs ridiculous. And I‚Äôve been in defense of the refs with some of the ‚Äúweak‚Äù techs because I see it‚Äôs clearly certain players that complain constantly that get the ‚Äúweak‚Äù techs but that was ridiculous. The play happened right in front of him!"
"True but the question was about a young CORE. Not who had the best young player. Our 1st round pick this year, Desmond Bane, is on pace to break the rookie 3pt% record. He's at 45.9% right now. Brandon Clarke was the summer league MVP last year, Tillman out of Michigan St was a 2nd round steal this year. Grayson Allen has been a 40+% shooter, Ja Morant was Rookie of the Year, and that's all without Jaren Jackson Jr. The whole CORE"
"Grayson Allen has been playing like a borderline All-Star recently, which disgusts me to type out."
"He's likely regressing to who he is.  A slightly above league average shooter, who is slightly below league average athleticism.  He'll never fix the latter, and if he doesn't fix the first one, no one will give a shit who he is in 2 years.  &amp;#x200B;  If I had to take one of either Herro or Grayson Allen for the next 5 years, I'd take Grayson as he's been improving and quietly became a better shooter than Herro ever was hyped to be."
"Some ppl ik irl keep trying to argue that ja morant is better than zion because Memphis is winning more games. Morant obviously has a positive impact but his numbers have been pretty inconsistent, I don't watch many grizzlies games but just looking at the box score, they're getting great contribution from guys like JV, brooks and Grayson Allen, Anderson etc   Between the 2 teams, who do you think has the better supporting cast?"
"Grizzlies and Hawks both have widely hated players in Grayson Allen and Trae Young respectively, however Grayson Allen is hated because he is a genuinely dirty piece of shit and Trae cuz gets a lot of fouls called on him and he gets to the line.   Pels have a hyper popular and exciting young core in Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, and some fat guy from Duke. Honestly both an exciting future and also a future that I'm pretty sure they'll fuck up somehow so follow the Hawks, unless you want to be happy in any way."
god dammit grayson allen if we won that game we couldve been the 7th seed
Grayson Allen most definitely.
"Pat Bev, Hansborough, Grayson Allen, Matt Barnes, Chandler Parsons, Joakim Noah"
Grayson Allen has such a punchable face.
Grayson Allen.   Saw his college shenanigans and decided to hate on the man. Even though he hasn't had any incidents since then (other than early in his career) and the blow ups could be attributed to passion but idk
"I say this as someone who hates Grayson Allen (and a UNC guy). Some of those calls were bullshit and shouldn‚Äôt be implied to be dirty. The Clemson one in particular I was looking for contact on the rebound... nothing, he‚Äôs just frustrated and gets a tech for being frustrated when no one else would have gotten a tech for what he did. The VT one too, he‚Äôs just physical and tries to get the ball back. UVA he could have been sticking his leg out to trip Guy or he could have been off balance trying to get around the screen, we just assume it‚Äôs the first because that‚Äôs what we expect from him.  He‚Äôs the actual worst, and there are so many clear, inexcusable, non-basketball plays that he‚Äôs made (knocking over garrison brooks in transition, tripping incidents against Louisville, FSU, and Elon, etc.) that you don‚Äôt need to add that shit in to make him look bad."
Who called Grayson Allen being good?
"Looks like he averaged 83% FT over 4 years of college - [https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/grayson-allen-1.html](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/grayson-allen-1.html).  So that 90% is probably high, but not by a lot."
"Sigh....  Jay Williams, Luol Deng, Chris Duhon, Carlos Boozer, Elton Brand,  Corey Maggette, JJ Redick, Sheldon Williams, Gerald Henderson, Josh McRoberts, Jason Tatum, Austin Rivers, Jabari Parker, Brandon Ingram, Zion Williamson, RJ Barrett, Jahil Okafor, Grayson Allen  Clearly you don't understand what the word TYPICALLY means. Now you have been schooled. Enjoy the L."
"Grayson Allen wasn't in this game. Was this Marv Albert?  Edit: nevermind, must've had something playing  in the background...."
Jimmy thought he was Grayson Allen smh
miami didn't let grayson allen make two straight 3s
The Grayson Allen charge was mid fourth quarter
That it was unexpected for Grayson Allen to outscore Steph in OT. Is that what you expected?
&gt; Oh so that‚Äôs why everyone hates ~~Grayson Allen~~ Draymond Green
Well if Curry was guarded like Grayson Allen maybe he‚Äôd score 6 points
I know I texted my buddy I can‚Äôt believe Grayson Allen might be the hero of this game
That‚Äôs not ideal. Grayson Allen had 6 points and a steal
I‚Äôm man enough to say that I bought a Grayson Allen Jazz jersey a couple of months ago for half price. I got clowned on at r/basketballjerseys but the dude is lights out from 3 soooo.
"It wasn‚Äôt early, at 8:31 in the fourth quarter Grayson Allen got called for a charge that was bs and they didn‚Äôt use it. Would have put them up 87-81 with 8 minutes left"
"That‚Äôs not the call, again you clearly didn‚Äôt watch the game. It was 8:31 fourth quarter Grayson allen and the game was tight. Draymond was clearly moving and they gave up two points"
Oh so that‚Äôs why everyone hates Grayson Allen ..
"**OVERTIME**  Unlikely hero with the deep shots in OT as Grayson Allen hits us with bay to back threes, including one after another out of whack pass by Stephen Curry out of the double team. [The vision of Tillman for the assist in the first one is marvellous, in opposition to the abhorrent transition demesne by the Dubs on the latter one.](https://i.imgur.com/5opZ7T6.mp4)  [Jordan Poole with the clutch shot to put Golden State up 2](https://i.imgur.com/apWIKIO.mp4) and Tillman makes up the miss in regulation on the opposite corner, [with a beautiful feed by the best jumping passer in the NBA](https://i.imgur.com/6eZmCeZ.mp4).   The rough patch continues for Wiggins who missed both jumpers, including a 3-point attempt that doesn‚Äôt even touch the rim. After Poole dribbles off his leg, it‚Äôs up to Ja to clinch the playoff spot. He attacks JTA 1v1, spins inside and [hits the floater - the shot that has served him so well this year - scoring his 35th point in 29 shots, including 5-10 from deep](https://i.imgur.com/2itlkSS.mp4).  Poole [shows up again for a miracle shot and a glimpse of hope](https://i.imgur.com/A6KB3B2.mp4) but there was not enough time to do another comeback.  [Memphis‚Äô defense was the main story](https://i.imgur.com/DgdcXmp.mp4) and I honestly never expected that would have been the case - it‚Äôs what brought them to the position of advantage they enjoyed for most of the game. They had more steals than turnovers! Incredible display on the road with high pressure for such a young team.  Put some respect on Dillon Brooks‚Äô name because these 2 games he‚Äôs been just outstanding defensively, and the support he got inside to avoid cuts to the rim was great as well. Tillman did a fantastic job coming off the bench, especially on defense in the balancing act of covering Draymond Green and making sure to contain Steph enough to give time for Dillon to recover. And Ja Morant made the most of every chance in a way that he didn‚Äôt on the previous game in a great display of control and poise (He even had some great defensive plays, both top-locking Steph himself or bothering people on recoveries). Not to mention the shots by Allen or the masterclass that Kyle Anderson put out there.  For the Warriors, it‚Äôs hard to make any takeaway expect it is impossible to win when turnover over the ball in such a way - and that has to fall on Curry and Green, combining for 13. It seems to an extent that they had all these high intensity games caught up to them but the expectations at this level are cold and ruthless. Like in the Lakers game, they had a TOV% and an Opposition FT Rate both crossing 20%. So once again, they win the half-court battle but are completely destroyed in transition (160 ORTG in transition plays for the Grizzlies this game on CleaningTheGlass. That‚Äôs a lot btw.)  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî   **NOTES:**  Great adjustment making sure to match Brook‚Äôs minutes as much as they could with Steph after the way he got hot against Melton the previous game.  Not just the terrible lost possessions, but Dray was so much less impactful on defense than he‚Äôs been the last few weeks. Another indication the fatigue caught up to him.  Since the broadcast didn‚Äôt call it out, [just want to give props to Looney for the great seal here](https://i.imgur.com/XmkiyNw.mp4).  The Jordan Poole rise is something I will never understand but something I will always be thankful for. He simply came back from the mid-season G-League bubble as a great player. His decision making is surprisingly good and that was visible in multiple points down the stretch. Honestly, if they wanted to have him out there (and I agree it was the right call), he should have gotten more on-ball plays, getting Curry less times facing a double team and taking the ball out of a cold Andrew Wiggins.  Mulder‚Äôs shot has just not been reliable enough in these games. 1-8 from deep in the Lakers and 2 Grizzlies games.  Kyle Anderson is such a solid 2-way player and such an unconventional entertaining watch. He got a huge amount of responsibilities on help defense this game and [absolutely delivered](https://i.imgur.com/prSALaH.mp4). A very well earned +11 on the night."
"**1ST HALF**  The crispness that characterised the first half with the Lakers was not to be displayed in Chase Centre - The game started with slips in Warriors‚Äô execution such as [Bazemore pointing Looney to close out to Morant in transition and both players go towards Jaren Jackson, Wiggins going over a screen on Ja Morant or Draymond with another sloppy pass costing a possession.](https://i.imgur.com/af3qx53.mp4).  Dillon Brooks continued right back up with the great ball denying on Stephen Curry, [top-locking before he can use a screen but never overreacting to the point Curry can slip the other way](https://i.imgur.com/R5OWIXj.mp4). Great job for the Grizz if the only people touching the ball an entire possession are Looney and Green.  Or, [to bring it all together in a single clip‚Ä¶](https://i.imgur.com/nY8n66I.mp4) The play for Wiggins to post up on the left side has been a part of the Warriors offense this entire season but it has worked by exploiting swathes to smaller guards. Doing it on 6‚Äô9 Kyle Anderson seems like a bad plan. The moment Morant stayed home, Andrew should have looked to reset the play.   Morant does hit a 2nd 3 as Curry goes under the screen and the Grizzlies have an early 10 points after going 6-6 to start the proceedings.  [Painful to watch](https://i.imgur.com/tntlkmV.mp4); 4 turnovers in less than 4 minutes.  When they sat JV and went to Jaren as the stretch 5 I actually think it helped the Warriors defense. Looney was so preoccupied with denying JV‚Äôs threat near the rim that he never really committed to contain the ball handler in pick-and-roll. Now, Looney (or any Warriors playing the frontcourt) [is more comfortable switching on defense as it no longer represents a deadly mismatch for some poor wing-sized player.](https://i.imgur.com/CTPMi0H.mp4) Kerr would bring JTA in the next possession and downsize as well.  Ja Morant came out looking to prove something after Friday‚Äôs game. Started with making his 3 point shots and was [throwing JTA into a blender 1v1.](https://i.imgur.com/FsoBF5O.mp4) Halfway through the 1st and he was outscoring the Warriors 10-9. Chase Centre sounded like it was the peak of the pandemic.  [The Warriors were looking like they have never played together](https://i.imgur.com/rltn89b.mp4) - Bazemore should know that‚Äôs always a switch.  An important change takes place as Poole checks in - The chance to have someone else running pick and roll and add some extra spacing for Curry to run around in the week side [starts to pay some due](https://i.imgur.com/kRuL3D0.mp4). This was immediately followed by [the ‚ÄúCurry experience‚Äù](https://i.imgur.com/5F1j03R.mp4) and suddenly the game was within 2 after Steph‚Äôs 10-point spree. With an apparent shift in momentum, the quarter ends a tight 30-29 for Memphis.  As Looney starts the 2nd quarter, it is now clear they are matching his minutes with JV. And the way he opens up the path to the rim for the Memphis offense returns as well - especially deadly if you don‚Äôt have Draymond‚Äôs help defense to mitigate [how much Looney gets pulled by JV‚Äôs gravity](https://i.imgur.com/Eh5Xqbz.mp4). Same goes for how he can act as a hub at the top of the floor - [and you just can‚Äôt switch off like that when guarding Bane](https://i.imgur.com/CZxaZGg.mp4).  A nice Warriors play as they bring the big out of the paint, open up the weak-side and [have the point guard set a back screen for a wing to finish an alley-oop](https://i.imgur.com/vjCb2vA.mp4). A similar play (with a different build up) can be seen [here giving a dunk to Kelly Oubre](https://i.imgur.com/onco4eJ.mp4).  Wiggins goes at Grayson Allen and, blowing by him, draws the 3rd fouls on Jonas at the rim. The big goes to the bench again with his team ahead by 6. They were looking to have Andrew post up Allen but [good job fronting the bigger player](https://i.imgur.com/9L9SFyg.mp4).  With the starters back in, [the turnovers out of Draymond and Steph passes continues](https://i.imgur.com/dYq2aeB.mp4). With the constant sloppiness, [the controlled play of Morant](https://i.imgur.com/mPLoLyv.mp4) and the better outside shooting (MEM shooting 9-17 and Curry missed a couple of wide open ones), went to rest leading by 13.   ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî   **2ND HALF**  Early in the 3rd we saw the home team busting out a zone defense and [the different look worked to create some confusion and staleness](https://i.imgur.com/yYf4q4p.mp4).   Foul trouble continues to pile up as Jonas and Jackson Jr. are both on the bench with 4 fouls halfway through the 3rd. Related tot hat and since I haven‚Äôt mentioned him yet. Tillman was wonderful off the bench. He snipped a pass from Green earlier on, blocked one of Dray‚Äôs drives to the rim and he was efective spreading the floor on offense as well.  Ja Morant‚Äôs shot was a gigantic swing factor. It seemed like 2 or 3 of the defensive breakdowns by the Warriors this game resulted in an ‚Äúso wide open its practice‚Äù 3 point attempt by Ja and [he never failed to make them pay](https://i.imgur.com/oXyPEvu.mp4).  There were a couple of occasions near the end of the quarter where the Warriors broke down the defense - [one where the separation caused by the screen on Brooks lead to a general overreaction that opened the corner 3 and another where in semi-transition where Draymond‚Äôs drive collapsed the defense](https://i.imgur.com/mLl1bAn.mp4) - but in both cases Bazemore couldn‚Äôt make them pay.  Still, Memphis went a bit cold as they couldn‚Äôt capitalise on several Morant drive-and-kicks. By missing the last 9 attempts of the quarter, the Warriors managed to go into the 4th only down 5 points.  In one of the most shocking moves of the season, Kerr actually starts the 4th with Steph Curry on the court - it really is do or die. The fact that this breaks the usual rotation also meant it was the only stretch where Curry got to play without being harassed by Brooks. What is ridiculous is that, in the 2 minutes he got in this situation, they were running plays for Andrew Wiggins. Embarrassing management of possessions.  Already back in the meat grinder, [Curry gets everyone in the Bay a ticket to the circus](https://i.imgur.com/DqmDo04.mp4). Then, the inverted pick-and-roll causes a miscommunication between Melton and Brooks, [for another insane shot](https://i.imgur.com/s4QsMDe.mp4). On the other side, Valanciunas (being used every trip to start things off with a DHO) was creating havoc, [both on the offensive glass but also making use of his pass to punish double teams](https://i.imgur.com/LI3u6OY.mp4).  But the turnovers kept on coming: [Curry starts the Memphis fast break himself and Wiggins fumbles a pass while cutting for the second season-defining game in a row](https://i.imgur.com/tWqFfSv.mp4). He also missed a layup within the last 5 minutes.  A Warriors 9-0 run over 2 minutes, where the defensive intensity was noticeably better and the Warriors were capitalising out of those stops, [culminates on Valanciunas fouling out and Curry tying the game from the free throw line at 97.](https://i.imgur.com/oWrTC8q.mp4)  In the possession of regulation for the visitors, Ja wanted to attack Curry but the pre-switch with Draymond broke down that initial action. They then spread out and give the ball to Kyle, the person Curry is guarding to attack 1v1. Draymond comes in to help and force the kick out for [a quick Tillman corner 3 as the shot clock expires that misses wildly.](https://i.imgur.com/qpC5QIH.mp4)  Draymond on the roll gets his floater contested in perfect fashion by Xavier Tillman and the game goes to overtime."
Grayson Allen has really improved his spot up corner 3's and he has 'toned' down his 'dangerous' defensive style. Fits well with his role on the Grizzles
This sub now being pro Grayson Allen is the funniest shit
Great back to back 3s but fuck Grayson Allen
These Grizzlies are so much fun to root for besides Grayson Allen.
Yeah being a Grizz fan and having to root for Grayson Allen is like fighting your own basic instincts.
I like the grizzlies except Grayson Allen. Fuck that douchebag
"And the worst part about it, is that it was Grayson Allen and Xavier Tillman who ended his season!"
Grayson Allen is a punk but the guy shows up in big moments
Fuck Grayson Allen.......dirty player
Idk but what I do know is it doesn‚Äôt get worse than getting beat by Xavier Tillman and Grayson Allen. Grayson Allen because he is Grayson Allen. And Xavier Tillman because I‚Äôm a Michigan fan and seeing him hit a dagger 3 out of all things to ruin Curry‚Äôs insane season is just... idk what to say.
This sub will collapse if Grayson Allen ever won MVP
Love me some Grayson Allen. Dude just seems like such a stand up guy and has a very polished all-around offensive game.
"Grayson Allen I'll give ya but those other two, i don't know seems like a stretch."
The Grayson Allen offensive foul was pretty atrocious. It wasn't even close
"Memphis also had a precedent of giving up games, e.g. 2 points ahead against us, 0.8s left, and Grayson Allen on the FT line, ending on a Luka 3-pt at the buzzer."
Fuck Grayson Allen. I want to slap him in the dick and beat him up/off
"Future MVPs Ja Morant, Xavier Tillman, and Grayson Allen"
Grayson Allen making 4/5 3s and going +17 in 25 minutes is easily the biggest value add over expectation of any player in the game
Game high +17 Grayson Allen.
Fuck around and play Mulden and Wiggins and get eliminated by Grayson Allen.
Grayson Allen is only one being and not several.
Who would've thought that we would get a Grayson Allen redemption arc
This shot + 2 Grayson Allen 3s... who would‚Äôve thunk it
Curry got outplayed by Grayson Allen in OT üòÜ
Here's a dude who hasn't watched Grayson Allen play.
So all of a sudden Grayson Allen isn't a dirty player?
ngl-- I clicked the upvote button and then unclicked it because it's Grayson Allen. I didn't downvote but I just can't bring myself to like anything he does. He made big plays here but fuck that guy permanently.
Trade Wiggins for Grayson Allen wh0 says no?
The hardest pill to swallow is losing to Grayson Allen.
"Xavier Tillman and Grayson Allen (and Ja, of course) saved his dumb ass"
Can't spell Grayson Allen without Ray Allen
&gt;Fuck all of r/nba &gt; &gt;Mike Conley &gt; &gt;Tolerating Grayson Allen  Jazz fans ü§ù Grizz fans
All I know is Dillon Brooks &amp; Grayson Allen are the villains.
"That's easier to swallow than Grayson Allen and Draymond missing game winning layups. I'm really not sure about either of those. Oubre would be a solid piece if he's back. Steph. Klay, Oubre, Wiggins, and Dray is a mini death lineup as long as Oubre gets better IQ. I hope we get a solid hit on our pick this year too. We have a good future for losing KD and having our best players get injured two years straight."
I root for Grayson Allen.
Grayson Allen of all people hitting 2 dagger 3s was a huge surprise.  Felt like when he hit those it was going to end up being just a bit too much to overcome.
"R/nba troglodytes hate grayson allen. Meanwhile draymond green, whose cock is routinely sucked by these same assclowns, is actually a dirty player who has injured multiple people on purpose and pokes people in the fucking eye"
Grayson Ray Allen
True. The thing is yall got screwed by the Covid outbreak which carried into us losing our spot. I just hope we can get Klay back healthy as can be and get rid of Bazemore and Mulder. Good game. Salty we lost to Grayson Allen.
"Dare I say it, Grayson Allen was the X factor. Those two 3's back to back were clutch"
I was waiting for Grayson Allen to trip Draymond and draymond smacking up at him trying to give him a ball tap
imagine being sent home by Grayson Allen
"Yeah, hot takes and negativity gets clicks so it'll be ""does Curry even have a legacy?"" next few days. But its wild the Grizzlies all had random players come in and do some necessary shit at the right times. Grayson Allen sucked all game then hits 2 cold 3's in a row at a pivotal time. Tillman hits a clutch 3 with the clock expiring, and Ja getting buckets every time they needed it. Fun team, future is bright. As a fan of a young developing team that sucks I'm jealous."
"I'm so mad Grayson Allen got me hyped tonight, hate him but those threes were nice"
I was astounded to find myself cheering for something Grayson Allen did
Why do y'all hate Grayson Allen?
"Grayson ""Absolute shitstain dirty player"" Allen"
Idk what's worse being eliminated because we turned the ball over too many times in both games or the fact we lost to Grayson Allen
imagine being sent home by Grayson Allen
"Faced Lebron, Kawhi, and Grayson Allen*"
"As much as I hate to say it, Grayson Allen was huge for them during the minutes he got on the court."
Grayson ‚ÄúTed ‚ÄúZodiac Killer‚Äù Cruz‚Äù Allen
"Melton, Bane, and Grayson Allen are all elite shooters. Jaren Jackson Jr. is playing injured and was a 40% shooter on 6 attempts last season. They have enough shooting. This isn't 2k where you can just draft and trade for elite shooters to surround one player."
"I like Grayson Allen, I appreciate his competitiveness"
"This excuse is so lame. Its not like Grayson Allen, Dillon Brooks, Xavier Tillman, and Desmond Bane are much more respected than guys like Poole, Bazemore, and Wiggins"
Message received.  Grayson Allen is elite.
Yeah people hate Grayson Allen here.
"Grayson Allen was lowkey clutch as hell tonight, great job from Ja as expected"
Some love for Grayson Allen man.  Those threes were MASSSIVE. completely wrenched momentum away from the Warriors
"I hate my life and JORDAN POOLE, KENT BAZEMORE , GRAYSON ALLEN , DILLON BROOKS , KYLE ANDERSON. Jordan poole for that nasty turover"
You do realize the girzzlies we playing Grayson Allen right?
"It pains me to say this, but this game made me really appreciate Grayson Allen. Great basketball IQ and hit two massive 3s at the end. Team leader in +/-"
Probably the biggest gamechanger in OT and it's going to get overshadowed because its Grayson Allen lol.
"Grayson ""Ray"" Allen"
Grayson Allen was just a deciding factor in a game.  And he's going against his old team next round. God damn.
Imagine telling someone in 2016 that Grayson Allen would have meaningful moments in meaningful NBA games. No one would believe you.
And Grayson Allen as well
congratulations to the grizzlies for winning but no. not grayson allen.
Grayson Allen he is so talented and so Handsome.
Dude should have attacked Grayson Allen everytime down the floor in OT
Grayson Allen haters crying right now
Grayson Allen gave me flashbacks to that Duke title game
Here's the hot take! Basketball is still a team game and pretty sure Grayson Allen amd Tillman made 3 3's in OT? Morant didn't win this himself.
"The nearly non-existent Curry MVP buzz dying to Grayson Allen getting hot, lol.  Klay Thompson ain't going to fix this."
"After watching Grayson Allen and Dray make some good threes, this was a downer."
honestly blows my mind that Grayson Allen had +17 with 4 steals
Grayson Allen is that typical frat dude that plays beer pong and makes every shot
Taylor Jenkins with the flawless coaching job other than the missed challenge. Trusting guys like Grayson Allen and Tillman in crunch time over someone like JJJ? That's someone that knows their personnel.
What a great game. Ja and Curry were both huge. Even fucking Grayson Allen came up with two big 3s. Jordan Poole is going to be a problem next year. Three splash brothers. Fuuuuuck.  Good job Grizz!
I pissed that they lost to fuckin Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen was huge for the Grizzlies in key spots in the 4th. 40% three point shooter for a reason
Grayson Allen revenge series coming up
gRAYson Allen became the x-factor. Would you believe it?
I'll cut back on the Grayson Allen slander for a lil bit
I never knew Grayson Allen was 25
Would these teams be better with Wiseman the bum?  I swear the Warriors are better with Clarkson and Niang or Grayson Allen and Bane.  Wisebum is shit
Grayson Allen is very handsome and a Christian guy.  Chapel Hill media started those fake accusations of him being dirty.
Tyus Jones and Grayson Allen connection.  Bring Jah in Memphis!
"Grayson Allen is a fuckboi, but he's actually serviceable NBA player"
Really hate that grayson allen is on the grizzlies cause I like the grizzlies
GRAYSON ALLEN GOD
wtf TIL Grayson Allen still allowed to play with all his trash history.
"I wish sometimes players would be like, ""fuck going for 40. I'm just going to foul out Grayson Allen"" or something like that."
Why is Grayson Allen guarding Spida?
Grayson Allen getting bodied is like a fine wine.
Hot take:   Grayson Allen will be the next person in an arena to throw an inanimate object or bodily fluid on a player or fan of the opposing team
"sure! there's JJ Redick, Joe Harris, uh...  *checks nba.com*  Grayson Allen, Arcidiacono, Alex Caruso, Zach Collins, DiVincenzo, Ellenson, Eubanks, Kyle Guy, Hayward, Herro, Huerter, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Frank Kaminsky, Luke Kennard, Luke Kornet, Jake Layman, Meyers Leonard, Garrison Matthews, Dakota Mathias, TJ McConnell, Sean and Doug McDermott, Sam Merrill, Mike Muscala, Mason Plumlee, Payton Pritchard, Duncan Robinson, Matt Thomas, Dean Wade, Dylan Windler, and Cody Zeller."
Also the goat college player Grayson Allen
luka jokic redick rubio grayson allen boban porzingis etc.
Oh look it‚Äôs Grayson Allen Sr.
Someone could literally spend all morning doing this.  He‚Äôs the Slovenian Grayson Allen.
"It's all about rep. What i'm saying is Chis Paul is making Grayson Allen look like a saint, which Tim Duncan definitely is."
He makes Grayson Allen look like Tim Duncan.
???  Grayson Allen shot 86.8% from the free throw line this year.  Unless you're referring to the 0-1 free throw shooting he's shooting in three playoff games.
Dude JJ Reddick and Grayson Allen might be the most hated college players in the last 20 years.
Caruso is like an even more erratic Grayson Allen without a jumper
"Alright, but is that unbiased? Lol because there's players on most teams that do the dirty work but sometimes they can cross the line or are just annoying. Campazzo is annoying, Grayson Allen was dirty, but haven't seen be dirty lately.  Also I find Smart as just playing hard, but idk if other fans find him annoying as im a Celtics fan."
Grayson Allen?
Is Huerter trying to become the next Grayson Allen?
"Hahaha I fucking hated Grayson Allen when she was on the Jazz and thrilled when ditched his dirty ass, but I can‚Äôt stop laughing at the idea of him being like that one friend‚Äôs little brother that was just a little bit of a wildcard, like the little brother that still bit people way later than he should have been."
"My team needs to actually guard Grayson Allen.  I don‚Äôt get why Memphis shoots a lot of 3‚Äôs. You have a couple good 3-point shooters.   If Ja develops a 3-point shot soon, he will be a top 5 PG in the NBA right now, and I might still be underrating him."
"I don't really follow college ball as much and I don't really get into the drama, so I gotta admit the Grayson Allen hate is just weird to me.    Okay, so I understand he was kinda dirty in college and he looks like Ted Cruz.  That's a reason to hate him after a few years in the NBA?  Maybe it's because he looks kinda goofy that people feel comfortable piling on him, but the hate seems way out of proportion to his fame and exposure."
I'd argue that the fact that this guy is a full-time Grayson Allen-themed troll does *not* make it any less cringe
if you think grayson allen is a dirtier player than anyone else in the league you‚Äôre a moron
"Not gonna lie I actually like Grayson Allen despite his antics in College. He plays really hard and I was rooting for that Duke team with Jabari Parker. The fact that Grayson made it to the league and has impact is very impressive to me. That being said the Grizzlies are a YOUNG team, their 1ST Playoff run and everyone is mad at them for not hitting Allen more who was 5/8 from 3. Everyone is not Lebron and knows how to make the right play every single possession. As a young team it‚Äôs totally understandable."
You can‚Äôt spell Grayson Allen Thread without nobody gives a shit
"Grayson Allen is one of the few players I actively root against... because he‚Äôs a dirty scummy player, has been for years and doesn‚Äôt act like he‚Äôs ever tried to change."
Simp for Grayson Allen
"I agree, fuck Grayson Allen."
"What you need is to double down on collecting dirty ass players. If you hadn't traded Olynyk and you traded for Grayson Allen, you could have a lineup of Dragic, Allen, Ariza, Olynyk + center. They could average 2 dislocated shoulders and 3 ACLs caused per game. Championship team."
"I think Allen had one or two incidents his first year in the league and has straightened out since. He is now a role player instead of being the centerpiece, which makes a big difference.  Edit: spelling  Ps- I hated Grayson Allen when he was at Duke and I still don't like him, but he is a valuable part of our team."
and grayson. fuck grayson allen
Anyone else feel like the crowd was not as loud as it usually would be when it was Grayson Allen who scored 5 straight to tie the game?
The really cool thing about Grayson Allen is he hasn‚Äôt actually spent any of his nba contract money
Fuck Grayson Allen
Fuck Grayson Allen
I rather the Grizz draw plays for Grayson Allen instead of have Brooks and Ja wing them iso play in those closing minutes.
Grayson Allen could not miss then they just stopped passing to him
This was a winnable game for Memphis if Ja wasn't so selfish by trying to be the hero in the 4th. Grayson Allen was on fire and they just refused to get him the ball even when he was wide open.
There's been about 8 straight possessions where Grayson Allen was wide open from 3 and they just haven't passed him the ball.
[jazz fans trying to come up with a racial slur for Grayson Allen](https://i.imgflip.com/322ylo.png)
"Live by the Brooks, die by the Brooks. Honestly why has Grayson Allen not gotten shots"
"Brooks was chuckin, maybe they'll give the ball to Grayson Allen now lmao"
I‚Äôm a bigger college fan than NBA fan so it‚Äôs cool to see Dillon Brooks and Grayson Allen balling out again. Two guys I wouldn‚Äôt expect to be good pros.
"The Grizz are like reddit out there, rather lose than let Grayson Allen win."
Grayson Allen was on fire and they‚Äôve completely ignored him
Grayson Allen needs to get some shots wtfff
Give it to gRAYson ALLEN
is grayson allen the least likeable player in the league?
Grayson Allen game winner calling it now

"Grayson ‚ÄúTony‚Äù Allen.  Grizz fans, would you call him the Grindfather?"
Grayson Allen is the GOAT!?
"Allen just averaged 23.1 MPG in the playoffs. Great player. Not to mention that Thybulle despite being a great defensive player is one of the worst offensive players in the entire NBA.   At the time of the trade Bazley was the 23rd overall pick. Bazley was then traded with a 2nd round pick for Brandon Clarke. So your assessment of Bazley‚Äôs value is off  Green is not better than Crowder. They are pretty similar and Crowder is probably viewed as the better of the two right now.  Krover had value, he was flipped to the Bucks for assets. Getting Krover allowed the Grizzlies to get Melton.   And the pick was heavily protected, however you don‚Äôt know what the pick situation with Toronto was either.   So in total, trading away Conley got the Grizzlies; Grayson Allen, Brandon Clarke, Winslow, Melton.   I didn‚Äôt see any offers from the 76ers as good as that:"
"&gt; Traded Grayson Allen, Darius Bazley, Jae Crowder, Kyle Korver and a 2020 1st round draft pick to the Memphis Grizzlies for Mike Conley. (1-7 and 15-30 protected)  So a 2018 first round pick, a 2019 first round pick, an elite role player, and an aging vet, and a protected 1st.  Not exactly sure how Thybulle, Maxey, salary filler, and a 1st is far off from Conleys trade value."
Do you think they ship Grayson Allen out to force Jenkins to play Bane and Melton more?
"I was kind of surprised that y'all kinda just gave Grayson Allen away, but I think the FO knew Bane was gonna get even better and had pretty much rendered Grayson redundant."
"Memphis has really nailed the last few drafts.  Ja was an easy pick, but JJJ has shown awesome flashes when healthy, Brandon Clarke had a great rookie year (not sure what happened this last year), Dillon Brooks, Grayson Allen,  and now Bane.   JJJ just needs to pop alongside Ja!"
Probably one of the reasons they got rid of Grayson Allen
He's why they were totally fine getting rid of Grayson Allen. Dude has big time potential.
This. That first big playoff run Horst stacked the team with depth. Didn't work out and this last season he sacrificed depth for more a talented bench that can shortened the rotation to 8 players. Even with the owners hamstringing with the money he's still making moves and for later.  I mean dude flipped the 31st pick for four 2nd rounds and used 2 of them for basically Grayson Allen. Dude is a real life 2k myGM
You're the same type of person that said Grayson Allen was better than Trae because of the Summer League.
He's no Grayson Allen.
"Why do these ‚Äúworst offseason‚Äù posts always ignore Memphis. Added Bledsoe and Adams while dumping Grayson Allen and JV. Worst drop off in wins above replacement. Not a peep.  Pelicans +6.0 in win shares. 6th best in wins above replacement change. And I‚Äôm pretty sure Lonzo‚Äôs +/- is trash with Zion on the bench while Zion‚Äôs is fine without him. Good for him getting 85/4 but he‚Äôs extremely overrated.  And talk about skewing the narrative by saying the team got older. Come on, bruh, they got 9 players 23 and under. And Ingram is 24"
"False.  Grizzlies just traded us Grayson Allen for essentially 3 seconds because they had too many wings to pay.  Wings are extremely important, but you can have too many."
Grayson Allen went off in the Jazz summer/g league games a couple of years ago but it has never really translated to NBA games.
Bruce makes Grayson Allen look like Mike Conley
"In a very, very roundabout way, Grayson Allen getting picked (because of course he did) was a trade piece for Mike Conley."
Bruce was a terror. He may be the dirtiest player of all time. Puts guys like Grayson Allen in perspective.   https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6bc70j/a_history_of_bruce_bowens_dirty_play_filled_with/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
true but Grayson Allen is better than AD so it evens out
Grayson Allen.   May god have mercy on my soul.
"So we‚Äôre going to act like Grayson Allen was a guarantee from that pick? SMH‚Ä¶  You can get a vet min guy who can hit 35% on a contending team. Allen‚Äôs age really doesn‚Äôt matter, if you can draw a good vet min guy you‚Äôre fine."
Grayson Allen is 24 and shot 39% on 3s and averaged like 11 ppg. I doubt you get a guy like that on a vet min.
We got Grayson Allen out of the 31st pick this draft
"It was a second rounder from a different year, assets matter for trades.  We got Mirotic for seconds, we got Grayson Allen for seconds."
"You overestimate the role Bogdan would've played on the Bucks. He would've been a 10-15ppg scorer, mostly spotting up shooting.  That being said, I will be bold and say Grayson Allen is a very underrated scorer and I believe we've yet to see his best. I think he can become just as good as Bogdan sooner than later. What separates them so far is opportunity, Grayson was 3rd SG behind Brooks and Melton.   If Bucks let Grayson Allen start at SG, a lot of people will be surprised."
Grayson Allen can become that for them.
"Is Grayson Allen that kid that looks like an asshole abd has a few ""highlights"" of some very shitty bush league plays?"
Why would anybody stan Grayson Allen ?

"Im 99% sure he‚Äôs u/eaglefangkarate99 (account already deleted but by the end, he gets called out every time he posts), professional Grayson Allen Stan and Wiseman hater"
I dreamt of Grayson Allen last night. He was raining threes.  He'll do well
You know I think u/JoffreyGraysonIsKing might like Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen is Grayson Allen but he's a good fit for Milwaukee and they got him for little because they took advantage of Memphis being cheap. Im not ever really going to be a Grayson Allen guy even if he's been on better behavior these past few yrs but he's going to help Milwaukee and will help Memphis's stealth tank job by not being there next yr.
The Bucks trading for Grayson Allen
I'm literally defending Grayson Allen like 5 comments in LMAO. Get them eyes checked.
I think Grayson Allen might be the only player in the nba i couldn‚Äôt 180 enough to support. Maybe it‚Äôs different once he‚Äôs on your team tho
"Its about time Grayson ""the Apology"" Allen got the attention and tribute he deserves! Love it. Print it."
Grayson Allen looks and acts like his daddy gets the local DA to drop all charges against him by pulling strings.  I had to watch his smug face when he played against Wisconsin in the NCAA championship and now I can't pretend he doesn't exist.
Grayson Allen? You mean Caucasian Kawhi?
Grayson Allen is your favourite player. That's one I've never heard before.
Grayson Allen? No.
We lost Tucker added semis and ugh Grayson Allen (even if he will probably be really good for us) also brought back George Hill.  I can't really blame the owner for not wanting to pay probably 40 million including tax to bring by a 37 year old PJ even if I love him.  Which is yet another reason why the extra part of the super max shouldn't count against the cap.
&gt; It‚Äôs funny tho cus he has never injured a single player in his entire basketball career.  Players not winding up injured as a result of intentionally tripping them doesn't mean he wasn't trying to injure them. I'm not sure what Draymond Green has to do with Grayson Allen being a punk bitch.
"Jeff Green, Jae Crowder, Grayson Allen, idk why these 3&amp;D wings just don't do well in the Jazz."
I guess it's that I like Grayson Allen.  I got downvoted for stating that in this thread so it must be reeeally unpopular (&amp; not one of those fake-y unpopular opinions in which loads of folks actually agree with you)
Prep school abortion Grayson Allen is still in the league?!
this will be like Ted Lasso and Roy Kent  The most wholesome coach made Roy Kent a little more lovable and less assholeish  The Antantekounpo brothers will fix Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen punching the air right now.
Maybe they don't like Grayson Allen either.
~~Fuck~~ Buck Grayson Allen!
Google Grayson Allen Dirty plays. Dude was and absolute ass at Duke.
Haha Grayson Allen is a bitch go brrrrr
Grayson Allen had the GALL to play good defense on Trae Young so Trae got WELL DESERVED revenge by [shoving him out of bounds because Trae clearly is not a dirty player like Grayson is](https://youtu.be/2db4SYPjmcc) /s  Grayson Allen is the only player in this league that can have a whole fan base hate him because he got shoved in the back and walked away.  It would be like Clippers fans hating CP3 for Pat's shove.  He was dirty in college and Hawks fans want him to be a dirty player so bad because Trae hates him. But he's not a dirty player any more.
"My hope was, ‚ÄúOh, there‚Äôs another Grayson Allen.‚Äù Then, ‚ÄúDam it. It‚Äôs that Grayson Allen.‚Äù"
"We are not trading Grayson Allen to make room for backup guards. We are trading him because Brooks/Melton/Konchar is an SG depth chart we like for now and so we don't need to drop a bag on Allen who has probably already hit close to his peak as a role player. The second round picks will almost certainly be packaged to move back up in the draft and continue getting guys like Bane, Tillman, and Clarke.                   I really don't understand why you think your opinion of the Grizzlies roster holds weight when you freely admit that you don't know who these people are.  Its cool that you're this high on Grayson Allen, I like him too, but the gap between him and guys like Bane and Melton is really not that significant.           I think you would change some of your opinions on how good Melton and a couple of the other young guys are if you watched some Grizz games, which again, you should, they're really fun.          Also, Memphis has five first round picks in the next three years, in addition to already having Ja, JJJ, and Ziaire on the team."
Wanna go check out the comments on the Grayson Allen trade post?
The ultimate test of Giannis and his good will: can he somehow make Grayson Allen likeable?   I'm going to go with no.
"Lol Grayson Allen is not getting paid, they just have 3 SG‚Äôs better than him."
"Just google Grayson Allen lmao, it's not like he has other highlights."
"Grayson Allen killed the Badgers title hopes in 2015. He owes Wisconsin a title. If Bucks repeat, all is forgiven."
Is Grayson Allen still tripping people I ain‚Äôt heard of him in a minute
Grayson Allen is a bitch but lots of people under value him just cause of his attitude. He‚Äôs a solid role player to have off the bench
i don‚Äôt like beverly either but grayson allen somehow was playing like a little shit in summer league just two years ago.
Grayson Allen is a fine gentleman who has never caused any ailment to poor fellow
"For those confused about why the Grizzlies would do this, remember the scene in Moneyball when Brad Pitt told the A's coach to start Chris Pratt off the bench, but the coach kept starting this other 1B he thought was better so Brad Pitt traded that guy to another team? That's basically what this is here. Grayson Allen is a solid bench guy and could be great for the Bucks, but for some reason Coach Jenkins loved him so much, that he kept starting him and giving him more minutes over better players like De'Anthony Melton and Desmond Bane. I still think the Grizzlies could have received more for Allen, but I do think this will force them to play better lineups and improve the team in the end."
"We just had the youngest roster since 2012 Thunder to make the playoffs and lost two rotation players (JV and Allen), who are both on expiring deals that we weren't going to re-sign and traded them for a replacement big, the 10th pick and future draft assets and that's your definition of the ""worst offseason"".  Trading Grayson also had as much to do with a roster crunch at the 2, with better, younger options in Bane/Melton who will now get more minutes."
"Exactly, you gotta look at the bright side. Also, the Bucks just got a decent rotation player for basically nothing, so it's actually a really good move for them in terms of depth.  They could have had a real tough off-season because they have no cap space, but it has really worked out nicely for them. Between Portis taking an amazing discount to come back, this Grayson Allen deal, and Donte coming back from injury, the Bucks may actually be better next season."
"Grayson Allen really bouta get a ring before Melo, CP3, and PG"
Milwaukee needs Grayson Allen to destroy the Warriors again when they meet in the finals
What are we setting the over/under at for the amount of practices it takes for Bobby to punch Grayson Allen in the face?
grayson allen is the only *basketball player* i straight up hate for how they *play* basketball.
"U literally said Grayson Allen was the ""only player"" you straight up hate wym"
"i mean, no. i literally said fuck kendrick nunn as a free agent option two days ago because of that. i‚Äôve just watched grayson allen be a bitch multiple times with my own eyes so i absolutely hate him."
Just google grayson Allen dirty plays. And to make matters worse he never takes accountability for them
FUCK FUCK FUCK I DONT WANT GRAYSON ALLEN ON MY TEAM
"We have a logjam at the 2, this let's us play more Bane and Melton and avoid having to pay Grayson.  I get everyone on here hates Allen, but he was apparently great with our local media and had done a lot of work on his mental health issues over the last few years.   Good trade for Milwaukee, fine for Memphis to basically just get some fluff for an open roster spot for a guy we were unlikely to want to pay."
"I hated Grayson Allen at Duke and he‚Äôs reminded the NBA multiple times why he was hated in college, but that kinda standoffish, dick role that can still have a good night here and there, as well as a decent shooter, felt like a good cultural fit in Memphis. Definitely better there than the Jazz lol."
I don't like Grayson but this is a good move for the bucks. Grayson Allen will be able to give you rotation minutes.
Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen shittin‚Äô on Rudy.  That boy ain‚Äôt scared!
Grayson Allen is the absolute worst. That is all.
"I unfortunately didn't watch any Grizzlies games this season outside of them vs. the Bucks and the play-in game, but that does mean my first time watching him this year was when the Bucks lost and Grayson (Allen? What does his name usually get shortened to?) put up 26 points, so we've seen the potential!"
But why? Isn't Grayson Allen decent?
That one Grayson Allen fanboy must be hyped
"Power duo of Grayson Allen and Giannis ""Literally murdered Kyrie Irving in cold blood"" Antetokounmpo"
Yall will hate Grayson Allen more than actual domestic abusers lmfao
Fuck Grayson Allen
Maybe Giannis can teach Grayson Allen how to be kind
Fuck Grayson Allen...the modern Dunleavy
"I can't believe Utah gave up Grayson Allen. If someone designed a Utah player in a lab, it would be Grayson Allen."
I actually like Grayson Allen at least Milwaukee is the most despised team in the league now
Grayson Allen is a good role player lol do you even watch the Grizzlies???
grayson allen is literally the only player in the nba that i straight up hate.
Grayson Allen is a much better get than PJ
No fucking thank you. Fuck Grayson Allen.
Ew screw Grayson Allen
But fuck grayson allen though...
Fuck. I don't want to agree with you. But I agree with you. Fuck Grayson Allen.
All my homies hate Grayson Allen.
Noooooo I liked the Bucks but can‚Äôt cheer for Grayson Allen
*Memphis is giving away Grayson Allen
All my homies hate Grayson allen
Just here to say fuck Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen to the Bucks
&gt;Grayson Allen  I just don't see how he gets enough minutes to make an impact on the Bucks. Will he be the eight man off the bunch? I think it's safe to assume Connaughton and Portis will take most of the bench minutes
"I'll maintain my opinion: Grayson Allen for Sam Merrill, a 2nd and a free Rodgers jersey was the steal of the offseason."
?   As a starter last season Grayson Allen averaged 10.6 ppg with 37.7% shooting from 3.  Lol where are you getting your made up stats from?
Grayson is literally better than Shamet.  He started on a playoff caliber team and averaged 13+ PPG on great splits when starting.   Shamet bounded around team to team and was unplayable in the playoffs while Grayson Allen was pretty great especially in playin games.
The question regarding the extension that everyone should be asking is who‚Äôs the better fit on the Bucks roster? The answer to that is Grayson Allen.
Ima go with Donte ‚ÄúNot Grayson Allen‚Äù DiVincenzo
"Bucks fan that actually has had a chance to watch Donte for 3 years. Grayson Allen.  Donte isn‚Äôt as good as most people think he is on here. League average 3pt shooter with great team defense, but poor finisher and shot creator. He‚Äôs best used as a utility guy, preferably off the bench until he could become a more consistent shooter.  Grayson fits Milwaukee so much more simply because all the Bucks need out of their fifth starter is great shooting. That adds another dimension to their offense, and Grayson can also put the ball on the floor and finish a little better than Donte."
Grayson Allen because of eye test even though Donte has better stats.
I‚Äôd go with Donte. Might be Grayson Allen last year but our shooting has improved drastically while rebounding and perimeter defense are our issue now
I really don‚Äôt like Grayson Allen
Is this dude really better than Grayson Allen?
1. DeAndre Ayton - None. 2. Marvin Bagley - None. 3. **Luka Doncic - 5/$207m**  4. **Jaren Jackson Jr - 4/$105m** 5. **Trae Young - 5/$207m** 6. Mo Bamba - None. 7. **Wendell Carter Jr - 4/450m** 8.

My brain says you're right but my heart says fuck Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen makes as much per year as Derrick Henry.
Grayson Allen was low key a really good rotation player last year
gRAYson ALLEN?
"On a team with not many tradeable assets, Donte is the best one. He's on an expiring deal so if they know they aren't going to re-sign him then anytime now is the time to trade him to get anything back for him. Plus he's extension eligible and incredibly redundant with Grayson Allen so he's a natural trade piece. If Bucks are going to be making a trade this year then Donte is the obvious guy to move along with Nwora probably."
Grayson Allen is going to start until Donte comes back or proves that he‚Äôs earned it. I love Nwora but he‚Äôs got a long way to go before he cracks the starting lineup
"Jrue, Grayson Allen, Khris, Giannis, Brook  George Hill, Connaughton, Jordan Nwora, Semi, and Bobby Portis"
"So Grayson Allen and a crowbar are involved, gotcha."
"Bucks with Nwora averaging 19/6/2 repeat  Jrue, Khris, Nwora, Giannis, Lopez starting lineup  Divincenzo, Grayson Allen, Portis, and Nwora (if you don't have him starting) could all be 6MotY contenders, with the rest of the bench filled out by George Hill, Pat Connaughton, Thanasis, and whoever else. Really hoping Mamukelashvili can develop for them, he was a solid scorer in college as a 6'11"" stretch big, if he can carve out the backup center roll this team could beat anyone. Team would be deeper than deep. Hell even if Nwora was averaging like 14/4/1 they'd be solid."
"Unlikely that DiVincenzo gets an extension before the deadline. The money is extremely tight and acquiring Grayson Allen (also extension eligible) means competition for the starting spot, so most likely result is they wait to see how the season plays out for both of them."
I'm not a fan of KD ... but he doesn't belong there ... let's add ... Grayson Allen instead.
"College but, Grayson Allen cost me a LOT of money in 2015"
If that was Grayson Allen lol...
"it was a move that was too criticized for how it affected the team.    sign and trade Brogdon net us RJ Hampton, Jordan Nwora and Sam Merrill.    RJ Hampton was traded alongside George Hill, Eric Bledsoe and picks for Jrue Holiday.    not having Brogdon on the contracts (under the tax) allowed us have MLE to sign DJ Augustin and Bobby Portis.    DJ Augustin was traded for PJ Tucker.    Sam Merill was traded for Grayson Allen.    in all comes down to hindsight, but not signing Brogdon has 1) still allowed us to win a title, 2) go over the tax and have a core of Giannis-Khris-Jrue for the next ~4 years, and 3) netted us Bobby Portis, Grayson Allen, and Jordan Nwora who will all be in the rotation going forward.     on the other hand, if the Bucks had extended Brogdon, we still may win a chip in 2020 or 21 (not guaranteed obviously) but is that with Brogdon as the starting PG, or was he traded anyway for a higher tier player (could be Jrue, could be CP3)."
"Yeah.  Essentially having Bogi would have meant we never signed Bobby, we wouldn't have signed Augustin, which meant we wouldn't have had matching roster pieces for PJ, and we couldn't have even signed Bryn Forbes.  All 3 of those players helped at some point in the playoffs.  And I actually really like Grayson Allen as a poor man's Bogi this year.  Has a lot of the same attributes, and we got him for two 2nds."
"If we gave Tucker the money he got from Miami, he would have cost more than Giannis over the next two years.  And while I don't cry over the owners pocketbooks, they are paying similar money to roster Grayson Allen and Mamu, which I think is better in the short-term with Donte's injury and likely in the long-term with needing younger players."
I still think Grayson Allen was the biggest highway robbery of the offseason.
They also haven't made a lot of moves in the offseason.  EDIT: I had to double check and wait they signed Grayson Allen?? Oh man.
"They actually changed quite a bit, their depth is almost completely different. Brought in role players to fill gaps, like Grayson Allen, George Hill, Rodney Hood, Semi Ojeleye, and a new rook 'Mamu', and Jordan Nwora will probably get more time this year after looking really strong in the Olympics. Not earth shattering moves but quite a bit of roster change"
"Just for that little comment ESPN now plans to create the Duke Nukem Show with Jay Williams, Christian Laettner, JJ Redick, Grayson Allen, Shane Battier, and Kyle Singler.    They will spend their slotted time discussing NBA basketball in between comparing their Duke teams to everyone else‚Äôs Duke teams.  They will also discuss fun things like why Kyrie is getting harsh treatment and how good Zion looks.  Remember fans, that‚Äôs not fat you see on that body, it‚Äôs soft muscles."
And then he tried to claim he was hacked.  I also remember him tweeting about some dude tripping a player and calling him a disgrace and then a separate tweet praising Grayson Dickhead Allen for doing it.
"I know Merrill just scored like a million points last night, but the Grayson Allen trade very well may be the best non star related move any team made this off-season.  I doubted him, but you can't argue with results."
Yeah but you had Grayson Allen for a loooong time..
[Remember when Grant Williams pissed off Grayson Allen?](https://youtu.be/tpOeTMwIMJQ)
"I like this Jazz team, and I like Gobert a lot. But even as a fan of the opposing team I cannot express how incredibly frustrating it is to see Gobert under the basket with Nwora (6'6), Grayson Allen (6'4) or Jrue (6'3) switched onto him and there's absolutely no effort to get him the ball."
Fucking Grayson Allen
Goddamn Grayson Allen
"The 3-headed white SG attack is gonna be legendary.  Grayson Allen, Donte, and Pat are gonna be so damn scrappy. Gonna need to call an exterminator to deal with all these gym rats."
"Man if he could solidify himself as the third scoring option for the Bucks they would be wild. I know Per 36s are fucked but he put up 22.5/8/1/2/1 last year on 46/45(!)/76.  A starting lineup of Jrue, Donte, Khris, Giannis, and Lopez with a bench unit of George Hill, Grayson Allen, Nwora, Thanasis, Rodney Hood, Bobby Portis, Pat Connaughton, and the rest of the guys could be pretty wild. Crazy strong secondary, not to mention a crazy *crazy* secondary."
"George Hill, won‚Äôt be vaccinated and will get blamed for ‚Äúchemistry issues‚Äù. Bucks have already solved the Donte problem with Grayson Allen"
Grayson Allen gotta be on there too
big grayson allen guy?
"I hope no one put sneaky, the word sneaky when Grayson Allen commits a dirty play"
Thats ridiculous   Grayson Allen cant dunk
I probably forgot about them but who did the bucks add? Only guy I know is they added Grayson Allen
"Though Allen is undisputedly the better or at least the college player with more notoriety, Herro‚Äôs college averages are better than Allen‚Äôs.  Allen has not been better than Herro in the NBA. And I just realized I‚Äôm stil arguing with someone who rather have Grayson Allen because of his play in experience last year than NBA champion Lowry or Eastern conference Champion Herro. Like lol."
"If you knew basketball, then you wouldn't say Grayson Allen shot on amazing efficiency and claim Lowry played like shit when he averaged more than Allen on similar efficiency. Since you want me to use TS%, he shot 59% in the last 2 seasons respectively and averaged more than Grayson Allen and Memphis didn't make the playoffs in the last 2 seasons. Seems to me like you just have a hate boner for Miami and Lowry."
Lowry was terrible during the raptors run. Kawhi carries and the defensive players.  Grayson Allen helped Memphis make the playoffs almost 2 years in a row as a starter playing big minutes in the west on amazing efficiency.  Use TS%... if you knew about basketball you‚Äôd know that‚Äôs a better metric to assess certain players.   Lowrys 3pointer is a terrible in the playoffs.
"Kyle Lowry is a proven champion. Grayson Allen average 16 points on a team that barely made the play ins. And he shot on 54% efficiency while Kyle Lowry also shot on 54% efficiency, slow ass dude ü§£ü§£ü§£"
Grayson Allen literally was a starter on a playoff team averaging 16 PPG on incredible efficiency when getting minutes lol. He‚Äôs literally better than Tyler Herro.   Lowry is proven to be dogshit in the playoffs.
"Dude averaged 17, 5, and 7 last season on 39% 3pt shooting. If that's declining, then I guess half of the point guards in the league want to decline. Imagine thinking Grayson Allen and Semi Ojeleye are going to help the Bucks get far this year, especially against a vengeful Heat team ü§°"
"Grayson Allen, Giannis, George Hill Jrue and Middleton all playing this game apparently."
"We have Grayson Allen for that, he's considerably better than Forbes and Galloway. Still wouldn't mind the latter on the team though"
Grayson Allen scored 40 in a game for the jazz
"So you guys lost PJ Tucker and now you have Grayson Allen so you guys are the same team lmao. I‚Äôm gonna laugh when the East runs through Miami this year. As a life long heat fan Miami is always a thorn in every team in the East‚Äôs side, you can front all you want but with Miami there‚Äôs only one thing to say. FUCK AROUND AND FIND OUT BABY BOY"
Grayson Allen
"Grayson Allen is a huge upgrade over Forbes because he‚Äôs playable against the Nets (Forbes got destroyed on D).  George Hill is a huge upgrade over Teague and is a proven 2nd unit ball handler, something we sorely missed in the playoffs.  Donte is also our second best guard defender and he missed the last three rounds of the playoffs.  And while PJ Tucker let‚Äôs us not play Giannis on KD, KD averaged 35.4 on 59.5% TS.  He didn‚Äôt actually do much to so even slow down KD.  I think we‚Äôll get similar or better results by putting Giannis on KD, or even putting Middleton on KD."
"Yeah, if I recall correctly they resigned Bobby Portis, lost Pj, and got Grayson Allen. Not really changed"
Wait until Grayson Allen scores more than Jimmy Buckets in a playoff series.
Grayson Allen won the McDonald's All-American Slam Dunk Contest
Grayson Allen won the McDonald's All-American Slam Dunk Contest
"Don't forget Carushow, Grayson Allen and half of Steph Curry"
Grayson Allen???
"With Connaughton, Divincenzo and now Grayson Allen, the Bucks have a monopoly on the most athletic white guards in the NBA"
"On the bench with Grayson Allen, Dwight Howard and Meyer Leonard"
I mean I think people are expecting someone who had been and promotes himself as a leader to show leadership.  Most people think leadership is advocating for a vaccine that has about as low risk as you‚Äôll ever see and greatly improves personal and societal health.  No one is asking someone like Grayson Allen his views because he‚Äôs not a star and he wasn‚Äôt part of player leadership.
"The Grayson Allen trade should open up more minutes for him and Bane, which I think will really help the Grizzlies this year."
Add Grayson Allen and you got everybody
"I'm still in shock how the Bucks got Grayson Allen literally for free. Lakers level of robbery, and Memphis just gave him for peanuts."
"It's not one or the other; they made other signings that increased the luxury tax (George Hill, Bobby Portis, Grayson Allen). What they're giving is the reason why - out of all the other options to prevent an enormous luxury tax bill - it was PJ Tucker who left."
"I agree with people saying it‚Äôs a cop out answer if he said they‚Äôre banking on semi to fill pjs role, It‚Äôs pretty hopeful lol.  Grayson Allen was a nice pickup to help their offense however."
Grayson Allen pulled the fire alarm
Grayson Allen pulled the fire alarm
"&gt; Bobby Portis didn't have any impact on the series whatsoever  Bobby Portis rebounded and hit his open 3s, how is that not having an impact? Hitting your 3s is the best thing you can do on a Giannis led team.   &gt; Kyle Lowry is better than Jrue Holiday in every aspect (except defense and even then Kylr Lowry is not too far behind)  Lowry is a much weaker defender than Jrue. And Jrue on the Bucks moves the needle more than Lowry on the Heat because the Bucks are a more talented team with a generation talent on it. We only needed Jrue to be the 3rd/2nd guy on any given night to loosen up Giannis and Middleton. Lowry being better than Jrue on offense doesn't mean anything.   &gt;  Giannis only had one game where he scored at least 30 points.  Yeah because y'all quadruple teamed him and he passed it out to our shooters. That's why the series was one sided. You couldn't counter attack once we actually hit our 3s and you rolled over. Giannis didn't have to score.   &gt; Brook Lopez did was camp under the rim when Bam was scared to shoot, but I expect Bam to take those shots this time around and pull Lopez out of the paint. Bam has the speed advantage then.  So Bam will suddenly outplay Lopez because *you* expect him to in your homer mind? No facts behind it, just because *you* a redditor ""expects it"". Okay.   &gt; Grayson Allen is not going to be the difference maker in a two peat.  So Bryn Forbes being gone is a loss for us and a factor. But his much better replacement (who could even start over Donte) is a non factor? Tell me how that makes sense."
"Bobby Portis didn't have any impact on the series whatsoever. Kyle Lowry is better than Jrue Holiday in every aspect (except defense and even then Kylr Lowry is not too far behind), so I expect him to have the same impact Jrue had for the Bucks. Giannis only had one game where he scored at least 30 points. All Brook Lopez did was camp under the rim when Bam was scared to shoot, but I expect Bam to take those shots this time around and pull Lopez out of the paint. Bam has the speed advantage then. Khris Middleton did have good series. Grayson Allen is not going to be the difference maker in a two peat."
"So Jrue Holiday and Bobby Portis weren't good that series? That's ignoring the key players who weren't newcomers that we still have btw, Giannis, Middleton and Lopez.We also have a player than Forbes in Grayson Allen this time around, so that point is absolutely moot.  Heat didn't only get swept, they got blown out badly in of those games. Lowry doesn't change that."
"Bucks got Grayson Allen, a starting SG for a playoff with good 3-pt % for two second round Picks and Sam Merrill"
We signed Grayson Allen
"I agree the depth of the Sixers is better, but a lot of those Sixers team was mostly comprised of G-Leaguers that aren‚Äôt in the NBA anymore either so it might not be a huge difference. Especially with a team like 2019 Duke,  it‚Äôs possible the star power could win out. Like that team had Grayson Allen, Zion, Cam Reddish, and RJ Barrett. Even though the bench sucks, they could definitely compete with those Sixers teams."
It didn't work. Warriors scored 13 points in a 5 minute overtime. That's pace for about 125 points over a game. Warriors offense didn't get shut down at all  The reason they lost it was the Grizz roleplayers stepping up and hitting every shot as the Grizz scored 18 in OT  Grayson Allen hit back to back massive threes to ice the game.  Crazy how actually watching the games works  Nice job ignoring your fake stat parroted from First Take btw
Grayson Allen. People are throwing big names but this sneaky fuck would fuck around snd win it ll silently.
Under the radar bets for me:       Steven Adams   Boogie Cousins     Grayson Allen   Zach Lavine
"Am I crazy to think Grayson Allen compares to JR Smith but no one want to compare the white guy from Duke to to black guy straight out of HS? Similarly physical profile, 6'5 athletic streaky SGs. And both players biggest highlights are non basketball plays."
"- ATL: Hunter will win MIP. - BKN: Nash will find a way not to play Claxton again. - BOS: Nesmith will turn out to be a player in the mold of Covington much sooner than expected. - CHA: Plumlee will have a double double season with 4 APG. - CHI: Patrick Williams will struggle in his soph year. However, those counting him out long term will be wrong, as he'll develop in a major force after this season. - DAL: Tyler Terry will break out and play a decent role. - DEN: Zeke Nnaji will start pushing Gordon by shooting lights out. - DET: Jerami Grant will be traded before the AS game. - GSW: Poole will have at least 5 games in which he shoots 20 FG and hit under 6 of those. - HOU: Jalen Green will win ROY. - IND: Chris Duarte runner up for ROY. He'll post averages somewhere in the line of rookie Mitchell/Wade. - LAC: Will be very very disappointing. - LAK: Wayne Ellington is top 5 in 3pm this season. - MEM: Melton will, once again, play very limited minutes. - MIA: Haslem will play only a handfull of minutes but will be ejected from one game for a fight. - MIL: Grayson Allen will fill in nicely for DDV and might not give up tge starting position when DDV returns. - MIN: KAT will have a season which has him in the convo for MVP but ultimately not win due to team record. - PHI: Jaden Springer will surprise. He will become what people hoped Zhaire Smith would be, before he nearly died. - PHO: Mikal Bridges does not take that next step. - POR: Nassir Little top 5 MIP. Larry Nance 6MOY. - SAC: Haliburton and Davion Mitchell will make at least 5 starting backcourts cry this season. - SAS: Devin Vassell still will be disappointing.  - TOR: Khem Birch will average a double double. - UTA: Bojan will be traded before the AS game. - WAS: Gafford will post a pts/blk/reb triple double."
Grayson Allen has to be near the top
"fave: Yao  least fave: on the court, grayson allen  off the court, steph or lebron, not as much because of themselves directly but because they have the most irritating stans there are"
"Grayson Allen is a damn near 40% 3 point shooter, he‚Äôs bound to have those types of games.   Steph lost and there‚Äôs no excuses to be made when he had so many turnovers in crucial moments"
Favorite- Dame Least- Tie between Grayson Allen and Pat Bev
Hilariously lazy way of blaming the whole loss on the only starter with a positive +/- and the games leading scorer. There's no possible way you genuinely believe Steph's turnovers is the reason they lost that game.   Not only did the Grizzlies shoot much better from 3 as a team but the fact that Grayson Allen shot 4-5 on threes had a lot more to do with the Grizzlies winning than Steph's turnovers.
"Some of you guys say the most baseless shit lol. How many white players are talked about here that aren't for memes? Luka and Jokic?  Caruso is a meme, Grayson Allen is definitely disliked if he's mentioned, Kristaps isn't too popular from what I've seen. Luka is like the only non-meme white player that is more liked than disliked from what I've seen, if they're even talked about at all. I'm on here a lot too.  No one is making Kevin Huerter posts, or mentioning Joe Harris for anything other than shooting. Vucevic is barely even mentioned and he's a top 5 offensive center."
Got dammit Grayson Allen come get ya daddy
Especially Grayson Allen what a loveable dork
"well they've have donte again, and grayson allen is a better player than PJ Tucker. it's not a huge change, but they're stronger on paper this year"
Do any of those players play the 3 or the 4 like tucker? Is grayson the tripper allen a guy that you want to pay? Do you expect the team to match on a 16 million per year offer sheet on donte?   Seems like all of those are no's.
"They didn't sign Tucker because of cost AND projected decline. They then went out and traded for Grayson Allen, pretty clearly signaling they'll keep either him or Dante. So you don't seem to know what you're talking about."
"Pat Bev, Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Grayson Allen, Nic Batum, Bobby Portis"
"Like it would turn the most average players into lower level all stars.   Bobby Portis with Jokic court vision and ball handling? Monster  Derrick Jones Jr. with Luka‚Äôs court vision and Ball handling? Monster   Grayson Allen with Trae‚Äôs court vision and Ball handling? Monster   Etc, etc‚Ä¶"
"The only player I know publicly isn't fully vaxxed is Melton who has had 1 shot and just needs his second.

Morris twins / Grayson Allen. Whenever someone retaliates against them it‚Äôs justified.
"You‚Äôre being completely clueless about it though. Actually.  You‚Äôre insinuating that this is a racial thing that Jokic is getting less hate that a Morris Twin.   I‚Äôm pretty sure this sub is gonna take a stance on any MVP level player (Jokic, Curry, Lebron) over someone that everyone knows is dirty (Morris Twins, Pat Bev, Grayson Allen, JV)   So good reach"
"Pat Bev isn't an MVP? His whole reputation is being a pest on the court? Obviously people are gonna tolerate him less lmao. Grayson Allen? Zaza Pachulia? It's not a race thing, it's a player thing."
"First of all I'm not sure about Haslem (though for sure he's only in games to be a retaliatory goon for years now) but PatBev has about a dozen high profile moments where he purposefully injures someone or tries to.   ""Nothing else"" is a bit of a stretch, but as Westbrook says ‚ÄúPat Bev trick y‚Äôall, man, like he playing defense. He don‚Äôt guard nobody, man. He just running around, doing nothing.‚Äù  Secondly what a crazy thing to say. There are white guys and black guys who are cheap as hell in the NBA. Dirty players. The white guys who have done dirty shit just happen to be out of the league right now (like Brad Miller and Mike Dunleavy to name a couple) with the exception of Kelly ""The Arm Taker"" Olynyk and Grayson Allen. I don't know if either of them have had a dirty moment for a little while, unlike PatBev and the Morris Twins.   I played organized basketball. If you have, I very much doubt that you played at a high enough level where you have a guy who is just on the team to be dirty and physical. It's not normal. It's not even normal in the NBA.   So I don't know what you're on about as far as ""act like you've played"" when anyone who has played any sport knows that if someone does what Markieff does 99% of the time nothing happens because kids in middle school, high school, and college very rarely happen to want to fight. But things get stopped, the person will get ejected, people may get into a pushing match or just circle around the situation at hand, and on the rare occasion someone will retaliate. But in no basketball league on Earth is what Morris did not stopping the game and getting him thrown out. Especially at whatever level you played at once upon a time.  Then when you're in a league that has a camera rolling and you come to see the hit to Jokic's knee as well, Morris is looking at a much bigger problem than he was before in terms of suspension time. Especially considering he has a reputation among the league for doing stuff like this."
"If the NBA really wants to crack down on violence then they need to aggressively go after the instigators on these kinds of plays harder. Especially with repeat offenders like the Morris twins, pat bev, Grayson Allen etc.  You can either protect the players or wait for them to protect themselves."
Dillon Brooks and Grayson Allen are not dirty players  Grayson def was in college but Dillon never has been
This guy knows he has Dillon Brooks on his team *and* used to have Grayson Allen lmao
Good point. Grayson Allen is a dirty coward. I‚Äôve made comments about him before but couldn‚Äôt think of him in the moment.
"&gt; Pat Bev, Morris, Haslem   hmmmmm I wonder why you specifically chose THOSE players and not Grayson allen"
You think people would look at it differently if Jokic had flattened Grayson Allen?
are you suggesting he contributes less than Grayson Allen? I won't argue with that.
Grayson Allen. I can‚Äôt forget all the crap he‚Äôs done before. Just can‚Äôt root for him.
I‚Äôm sorry but if you think it‚Äôs realistic that Grayson Allen shoots 8 3s a game at a 40% clip ROS then you‚Äôre delusional. Go ahead and @ me at the end of the year if you think I‚Äôm wrong.
How many cheap shots and trips is he averaging though?  I think that‚Äôs the stat we want to know about Grayson Allen.
So 12ppg on 42% from 3 is worth $18MM/year? He's basically the equivalent of Grayson Allen.
"Nailed it.  Shoutout to Desmond Bane, Anfernee Simons &amp; Grayson Allen too.  Grayson‚Äôs giving us 15 PPG shooting 40% from 3 making 3.5 3PM a game."
"Grayson Allen has been the Bucks second best player so far this season, I think he has earned the starting spot over Donte simply because he is the better offensive player"
"Meh no Middleton, no Lopez. The one that hurts is a lack of Middleton. Once all the starters are back Milwaukee is going on a run. Grayson Allen is a clear upgrade from a guy like Brynn Forbes. Still have the serial killer duo in Pat Connaughton and Bobby Portis Jr. When Allen is more of the 6th or 7th guy in the rotation because the team has Middleton back and George Hill is confined to stand in the corner like a PJ Tucker with no defense, that‚Äôs when Milwaukee is back"
Grayson Allen may be the best basketball player ive ever seen
I cannot imagine how dark these games would be if Horst didn't trade for Grayson Allen.
"From what I see, Bucks have settled in the idea that the regular season's purpose is to work on your game and be a better team. Winning is not obligatory.  I think they will be ready in the playoffs. Bobby and Pat were prepared for the playoffs last year and I think they can be trusted if needed. This year the team is working on Grayson Allen and Nwora. I believe Grayson will be ready to contribute in the playoffs. Nwora will either be prepared for next year or will make a decent trade material.  In general I think the team has a plan gives playing time and adds value to all of its players. I don't think it will run out of trading chips."
Lol his preseason take was he‚Äôd rather have Grayson Allen than Lowry or Herro üòÇ
"when you've  been bounced around the league as much as Lonzo, you need to handle ALL situations well.  He's not about to Grayson Allen himself out of millions of dollars...right?"
"no, grayson allen"
Fuck that's twice this year I've turned to a Mavs game during last play and Luka has hit the buzzer (first one against Memphis when he hit that crazy shot after Grayson Allen missed both FTs to ice the game)
"To be fair, Grayson Allen channeled his inner Ray Allen out there in the first half.."
"Or Khris, or healthy Jrue   It was the Knicks versus Giannis and Grayson Allen wild what Giannis can do"
We should try offering Grayson Allen as a virgin sacrifice to turn this shitty start to the season around.
Grayson Allen has really turned into a solid player
Top league MVP candidate Grayson Allen.
That was a pretty piece of basketball to find an apparently invisible and therefore unguarded Grayson Allen.
Grayson Allen the best player on the court right now fight me.
Grayson Allen playing really well? My my.
"Grayson Allen. Nicknamed after his hilarious apology (sincere, I'm sure) tweet to Trae Young."
"Its only been 8 games, and even then 3 years ago we had 2018. You know, the draft with two top 15 players already, the 3rd best player in a finals team and thats still leaving out Shai Gilgeous Alexander, Michael Porter Jr, Colin Sexton, Miles Bridges, Mikal Bridges, Gary Trent Jr., Donte Divincenzo, Devonte Graham, Jaren Jackson Jr, Jalen Brunson, Grayson Allen, Kevin Huerter, Hamidou Diallo, Lonnie Walker IV, Landry Shamet, and Mitchell Robinson. Also Kendrick Nunn and Duncan Robinson as undrafted players."
"We are really out here starting George Hill, Thanasis, Grayson Allen and Pat Connaughton. The only reason we are at all competitive is Giannis being the best player in the world."
"&gt; Jamal when he was maxed was very inconsistent and was averaging 18/4/5 on 54 ts% with bad defense. That type of player is not worth a max. This is a fact proven by the existence of players of similar caliber none of which are getting paid the max. The conclusion is that he was given the contract based on his potential.  You mean a 20 year old was inconsistent? Shocking. A 20 year old averaging 18/4/5 with bursts of amazing play is exactly who gets the RFA max contract. I think you're thinking of supermax contracts which come after something like that.   Why? Because a team sees clear evidence in growth in the player as they've been in their system for years. They see a higher ceiling and as they mature and gain more experience (like every player in league history) they will become more consistent.   Otherwise they get the rookie extension which is for players like Grayson Allen, Larry Nance Jr., Kyle Kuzma, Luke Kennard, Markelle Fultz, etc. or the let Jamal Walk into RFA and feel disrespected or not believed in by the team, another team with the space gives him the max and then Denver matches it but with 1 less year on the contract.  &gt; The conclusion is that he was given the contract based on his potential.  Well...yeah. Of course. He had the same first 3 years as Devin Booker but just had less shots because Jokic was there. Same as Donovan Mitchell. All of these players are getting this contract based on their potential to grow and the teams belief that they will reach that potential. No player is an actualized or realized player at 21 or 22 years old.   When Jokic was averaging 18/11/6 did they sign him thinking that was going to be his peak? Of course not. When Mitchell was averaging 24/4/4 and shooting terribly from 3 and playing 0 defense did the Jazz sign him to the rookie max thinking that was the player they were going to get forever? No.  &gt; Reaching his potential or even improving at all was in no way a given.  A generic statement that can be applied to any player ever. Embiid being able to play 1/2 of a season when he got his extension wasn't a given. Trae Young finding a way to not be the worst defender at his position in the league and shoot better than 43 from the floor or 34 from 3 isn't a given--but he got his max. Fox turning out to not just be a stat accumilator on a terrible team when he was given his max isn't a given. KAT not being a black hole on offense and a terrible defensive player when he was given his max wasn't a given.   &gt; There were some things that were encouraging and would leave you to believe he's gonna improve, there were also huge red flags that would lead you to believe the opposite.  I don't know what red flags you're talking about. Year 1 to year 2 Jamal had a massive jump. Year 2 to year 3 Jamal's defense and playmaking took a huge steo up. Year 3 to year 4 Jamal took another step up in all areas and then obviously we saw the bubble. Then sure enough year 4 to year 5 was another giant step up.  There were no greater red flags with Jamal Murray than there are with any player at that age, and far more positives considering the nearly linear growth (and growth is never truly linear) compared to his peers.   &gt;  Waiting a year for him to hit RFA would've cost them nothing and alleviated a lot of the risk.  This isn't 2K. There is a human element to showing belief and trust in your player, especially for this Nuggets team and management, especially for all small market teams. You don't just get to let someone go to RFA and pretend like that doesn't stick with them, upset them, be in the back of their mind when they come up for free agency down the road. That's life. It has happened time and time again. If you think your player is worth matching a max in RFA then you max him on your own, otherwise you just bothered a cornerstone player of your franchise and also signed him to 1 less year than you could have.  &gt; Just because he turned out to be worth the max doesn't make maxing him a smart decision.   I guess it's a good thing that our front office of professionals designed to scout, draft, evaluate, train, and put players in positions to succeed before assessing the risk of 9-figure paydays knows better than you what is and isn't a 'smart decision'. It was a bad take then and I'm sure people let you hear it at that point just as they are now. It was a smart decision as a team, as a franchise, as a culture building organization, and as a small market team. No brainer.  &gt; This wasn't/isn't a reactionary take, all of you are just braindead.  Yes. It is everyone else who is wrong. Certainly not worth stepping back and reassessing your thoughts on a situation when everyone around you is telling you that you're wrong. It is the children who are out of touch!"
Giannis Antetokounmpo  Thanasis Antetokounmpo  Grayson Allen  George Hill (I think)  Sandro Mamukelashvili  Semi Ojeleye  Scrimblo Bimblo
Just assemble and start all the attetekunpo (sp) family plus grayson allen
"Both the Yeti and the Apology were up for bags we couldnt give them. And both deserved those bags. The financial cases for trading them are obvious.  Grayson Allen was not much better than Bane offensively. And Bane is better defensively. Bane is also on a rookie deal for 4 years since he was the 30th pick.  JV needed too many touches, touches freed up with Steven Adams. See the Rudy Gay ‚Äãtrade for Tayshaun Prince. That freed up touches for Zbo, Marc, and Conley. JV was also exposed as a defensive liability in the playoffs. So Steven Adams should give the Grizz what they need."
"The issue with JV was that he gets easily killed on PnR and counter. Also, he needs the ball often. Our FO wants the current young core to have more touches.    Grayson Allen was a huge contributor for us but we traded him for 2 reasons. We want to save money to pay our other players and also this means we move on with Bane and Melton for the long - term."
I know but Grayson Allen and JV were big contributors to the squad as recent as last season
Grayson Allen
Im honestly surprised we only lost by 12 but was like a 5 point game with a minute or so left. Turns out Grayson Allen guarding Mitchell doesn‚Äôt work lol.  Giannis taking 11 3s isn‚Äôt ideal but I don‚Äôt blame him since he‚Äôs the only starter and is probably exhausted.
"Giannis, khris, jrue, Grayson Allen, Jordan nwora"
"Jrue, Grayson Allen, Middleton, Giannis, Brook"
Grayson Allen by far
Nobody gives a shit about Grayson Allen anymore
"- W - Road game on a back to back - Around 30 mins played for most starters  Good game for us, can't fault the Bucks with their injury report being as it is.  Grayson Allen had a great shooting night and kept the Bucks in after they pulled Giannis, but he couldn't guard Mitchell on the next possessions which sealed the game."
Dumb ass coach let Grayson Allen guard Donovan Mitchell üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Grayson Allen again lol
You mean Rodney Hood and Grayson Allen?
"Man, Grayson Allen is just the whitest name imaginable lmao"
Goomby-Doomby  dude told me that Grayson Allen is better than Herro and Lowry is washed üòÄ
"Jon Horst for Milwaukee. Here's why.  I really like the past couple of years they have gotten a lot of younger players. Most contenders (Nets and Lakers) load up on older veteren players.   Portis, Connaughton, Grayson Allen, Forbes to name some over the past few years. If you get those guys to buy in they actually have room to get better as players.   The bubble year they really fizzled out because all of their role players were old. Hill, Korver, Matthews."
Grayson Allen? For real?
Grayson Allen
"Grayson Allen is going to have a long career as a roleplayer, but he isn't going to be a first second or third option."
"Grayson Allen has been an excellent addition to the Bucks. He's a seriously underrated shooter, and so far [nobody is scoring better from the left corner in the league.](https://i.redd.it/mrp0zpky3l081.jpg)"
"You put Grayson Allen in there as a joke about white guys, right?"
Grayson Allen right?
Grayson Allen is pretty athletic
oh shit.  I was guilty of stereotyping grayson allen.  edit coming.  guess its Duncan or Curry.
"[He had some pretty damn good combine numbers.](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/5/17/17366362/grayson-allen-nba-draft-combine-numbers-duke) I feel like he's definitely not the least athletic, he just doesn't use it as much as other guys."
"Allen had some hops, [he won the McDonald‚Äôs high school dunk contest](https://www.maxpreps.com/news/trKvo7BJmU24AZ_1yGQClA/photos-grayson-allen-wins-2014-mcdonalds-powerade-slam-dunk-contest.htm) over Kelly Oubre, Theo Pinson and others."
Isn't Grayson Allen actually pretty athletic?
Glad to hear fans all over the league agree that Grayson Allen is an all star
Is that Allen on the East Reserves Graysonüôèüèæ
Now if we could just get everybody else to just stop sucking this year (Grayson Allen gets a pass)
grayson allen &gt;&gt;&gt; whoever the bucks normal starting SG is
"This is extremely disastrous. Bobby Portis, Grayson Allen, Khris Middleton - all our best shooters - have 1 FGA attempt this quarter. Please give them the ball."
"Ah, the contrarian approach. I bet you love Beverley and Grayson Allen and Zaza because they‚Äôre overhated?"
"Been the case for them basically this entire year, opponent's players sitting (either for legitimate injuries or just ""load management"") and then still winning.  We had Semi Ojeleye, Justin Robinson, Thanasis, George Hill, and Jordan Nwora all playing 20+ minutes, with Giannis as our only normal starter playing 27 minutes (though I guess Grayson Allen has probably taken the job from Donte at this point, so him too, with 22 minutes)..... And won by 28.  Loyal Pistons fans buying tickets this year are definitely not getting a good show for their money."
"Lol thank you for this, for some reason I could see Portis‚Äô crazy eyes gazing up at Grayson Allen waiting for a response."
"Even though he's done some weird stuff with minutes allocation in the playoffs, I think it wasn't even his biggest issue. I think he's just bad at adjusting. The game-plan against his plays / against Giannis and there's just no counter to that.  Like think of the Raptors series, we lost 4 straight doing the same shit. Miami series, same. Then in the Nets series, we almost lost because he insisted on having Brook out there against a team that wasn't attacking the rim at all... I hope Grayson Allen helps us this postseason, having a reliable 3pt shooter can be huge for a team that shoot that badly usually in the playoffs."
"Half of his examples were AD not correctly guarding Giannis on a PnR and explaining it away as ‚Äúwell he had to stick on Grayson Allen‚Äù. If Giannis is giving you 40 then you stick on him. Many of them are ‚ÄúAD gives Giannis a wide open 3, win for the defense.‚Äù Giannis isn‚Äôt the best 3pt shooter but he‚Äôs good enough on wide open 3s that you can‚Äôt just leave him wide open.  Some other examples ‚ÄúAD gambled for the steal, didn‚Äôt pan out and Giannis scored, not his fault.‚Äù That‚Äôs clearly ADs fault lol"

I didn‚Äôt notice that Grayson Allen was on the Bucks‚Ä¶ has he cleaned up his act? I thought this dude was well on his way out of the league.
I tuned in for one play where Westbrook couldn't beat Grayson Allen off the dribble. I had to turn it off after that.
We don't win the Title without Jrue. We know he's a mixed bag on offense. He runs hot and cold something fierce. Jrue is 30 years old unfortunately that's not gonna change. On the bright side we have better shooters around him this year with Grayson Allen added to starting lineup.
Someone in the crowd really rocking a grayson allen jersey
Hey it was a bit of a long shot but he always had the physical tools and feel for the game. Lot of young guys like THT and Maxey taking advantage of their situations this year. Even Grayson Allen has stepped up.
"It's not that deep.  Making a post saying ""Grayson Allen... making a case?"" implies you think he might be making a case for MVP, which is an ignorant thing to say. I mean look at the fucking comments in here. No, I'm not trying to make people laugh, I'm telling you what I think about what you just said - it shows lack of knowledge about basketball, AKA ignorance.  Calling me a girl, implying my English is bad, typing in caps and being this defensive then saying  &gt;""Because I refuse to be talked to like that. By anyone!""  is hilarious, ngl. In any case. We done here? If you don't want people to tell you that what you just said is an ignorant thing to say and you're this sensitive, maybe the internet isn't the right place for you. Because I didn't even insult you. I called you an ignorant basketball fan, not an ignorant person, I don't know you. Calm the fuck down.  And if you don't wanna read stuff like that, you can make a post and say ""Murray has been SO good this year"". Don't type this ""Making a case....?"" shit and expect to be taken seriously."
"I wasn't.  Royce is a really great player and would start on the Lakers for sure. Grayson Allen might too if you put him in that situation. My point with them was that they were players who's contracts might be workable in a trade and are very good for their contract, but they would still only take the Lakers from the 6th seed to the 5th.   I've got a lot of love for Royce; his contract just kind of lined up with the range I was looking at for someone to compare to and he popped because he's exactly the type of player the Lakers would be looking for."
"Chris Paul, Trae, Caruso, Grayson Allen."
"The Bucks are a team, as constructed, can‚Äôt have half of their starting lineup available to play, which was the case for the first few weeks. Then Middleton gets placed on the COVID list. Grayson Allen is playing very well, but his contributions would probably be better if he was running with the second unit. Diviencizo (hope that‚Äôs how you spell it) is a big loss for that team defensively."
"&gt;	Giannis is supposed to lead this team to wins without Jrue, not Grayson Allen  Sources? Find that a little hard to believe"
You think Grayson Allen will start when Donte comes back? I've always thought he'd be better as your SG than Donte.
"What trades can they actually do though? They've got their 3 max guys, THT on 10m a year, and 11 guys on min contracts. All their picks are on other teams and plenty of other teams are going to have better deals for whoever the Lakers are looking at.  If this roster wanted reconstruction it had to happen in the offseason and, I know I'm harping here, not trading every asset they had left for Westbrook. This team is really stuck in right now and needs to figure out a way to win as they are; even if they do pull something off, adding a bench rotation player like Grayson Allen or Royce O'Neale isn't going to take them from .500 against bad teams to title favorite."
"i'd run ten times faster if I was chased by Grayson Allen, he looks like he tortured cats"
"This is fair, but we pushed the Bucks to 7 with an injured Kyrie, Harden, Dinwiddie, and no LMA.  In my homer ass mind, I think current Harden plus having LMA and Mills on the team makes us way better than that version of the Nets, so I'm feeling pretty good. (I know the Bucks improved too with the addition of Grayson Allen, but not having Tucker is gonna be interesting for them, especially in our match up)"
&gt;Yeah he‚Äôs so scary. I‚Äôd rather get chased by someone classy like Grayson Allen  /r/nbacirclejerk is leaking
i mean no lie grayson allen more likely to shoot the intruders lmfao.
Yeah he‚Äôs so scary. I‚Äôd rather get chased by someone classy like Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen. Averaging 16 points per game shooting 44% from 3 on almost 9 attempts per game.
"I mean, we've played 14 games. 5 starters \* 14 games = 70 games total.  Missed games: Brook 13, Khris 8, Jrue 6, Donte 14, Giannis 1.  That's 42 missed games. So, we average 3 starters out per game. (14\*3=42)  Portis who's supposed to be our 6th man has missed 5 games, Semi 5, Hood 5. We don't have many actual NBA players left lmao. If the Grizzlies hadn't gifted us Allen we'd have an even worse record.  **On top of that, we don't have a replacement** **Center** so Giannis is forced to do most of the interior defense / rim protection against traditional centers for full games, he doesn't get to chill in the corner at all.  Our spacing also sucks. This is not the Bucks team they built around Giannis. Only 2 of out top 10 3p. shooters (in attempts) shoot better than 35%. It was 8/10 last season, and 10 out of 12 if you look at the next too. Literally everybody other than Giannis and Brook was good from deep. Now it's only Grayson Allen and Pat, everybody else sucks."
"I agree. The NBA, it seems, base things like this according to your reputation. If it were Draymond Green or Grayson Allen, they‚Äôd be gone for at least 25 games."
- Gary Trent Jr  - LaMelo Ball  - Evan Mobley  - Montrezl Harrell  - Cole Anthony  - Richuan Holmes   - Grayson Allen  - Tyler Herro   - Dejounte Murray  - Jonas Valanciunas
"Giannis playing center and the whole team make up looks like the AD- Jrue Pelicans   We got 3 guards in the starting line up, couple of SF/ PF guy that really provides nothing, some undersize wing playing at the 3. A stretch 4 next to Giannis playing C  So Jrue playing Jrue role Giannis doing everything on both ends like AD did George Hill playing the Tim Frazier role Grayson Allen playing the Eric Gordon role Pat Connaughton playing Dante Cunningham  Bobby Portis playing Nikola Mirotic   It‚Äôs just not very good."
4? I thought Jrue was back and isn't Grayson Allen shooting 45 from 3 on 9 attempts a game with excellent defense? Wouldn't that make him a starter with everyone healthy?
"This is why Tucker is in Miami and not Milwaukee. Plus, they ended up going further into the tax for Grayson Allen, who, for those that haven't watched him since college, is a fucking 10/10 fit next to Giannis."
"‚ÄúClearly lacks‚Äù isn‚Äôt accurate. Yes the other three have better shooting but you don‚Äôt see Curry or anyone bullying their way to the rim with Giannis‚Äô consistency either.    Just like Curry and KD have their signature unguardable accuracy, Giannis has his insane finishing. It doesn‚Äôt matter which looks prettier when points are points.   Factor in defense (which you have to, despite everyone ignoring it) and Giannis suddenly has a very strong argument, despite record. Not his fault that the entire Bucks roster has been hurt and he‚Äôs only had Grayson Allen as another consistent scoring threat."
"Well I did say 3-point shooter. Right now only two people (KAT &amp; Grayson Allen) are shooting a better percentage on more volume. He could definitely be considered top 10 for specifically 3s.   The passing is more subjective but he‚Äôs extremely accurate, especially at distance. Did you see [this pass last game?](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=l_EwrGCvtwc) How many players are making that?"
This is an off note but Grayson Allen has been playing really well lately.

grayson allen? the zodiac killer?

Caruso vs Grayson Allen for the title of great white hope will be hotly debated
‚ÄúA meme‚Äù exactly. That‚Äôs all it ever was. People just laughed it off like it was nothing but Grayson Allen is forever the antichrist to some people. It makes no sense.
"Adams is more versatile and mobile, but JV is way better in the drop scheme that Jenkins loves to run. Plus Grayson Allen was kind of underrated as a defender, he looks shitty but he's actually got long arms and he works really hard getting over screens. And finally, for most of this season Dillon Brooks and Kyle Anderson haven't started, they were very important to last season's defense."
You say fists only but I can guarantee Grayson Allen would be sneaking in at least a chainsaw
"My money is on Giannis, Bobby Crazy Eyes and Grayson ‚Äúsweep the leg‚Äù Allen. Brook Lopez looks crazy enough to do some damage too."
"People sleeping on us here. Antetokounbros + Portis alone is tough, then Holiday and Connaughton and Ojeleye are all jacked as fuck and Lopez is massive even by centre standards. And you know Grayson Allen would be fighting dirty."
I kinda sorta dont want grayson allen to be a bucks record holder.   Its tough adjusting to trying to like this guy.
This is exactly what taking advantage of the moment. Khris Middleton is sidelined. Grayson Allen steps up and who would have thought he would deliver.
"Comparing Grayson Allen to an All star is the funniest thing I‚Äôve ever heard. There weren‚Äôt any available.   Since Klay was out there wasn‚Äôt a realistic trade that would have made them a title contender or even a playoff contender more than they were and since Wiseman had talent he really was the best #2 option and hope he could turn it on like Edwards did. He was looking good in his last few games so maybe he could‚Äôve but he got hurt so you don‚Äôt know. You always heard how they needed to get him going. Again there was no all-star you‚Äôre making him up and It‚Äôs not like a role player like Vucevic would make them a playoff team, they were playing 8 deep to end the year and he DEFINITELY wouldn‚Äôt be a better piece in the future. Draymond was talking about the Wizards. He literally told Myers who to draft this year and there‚Äôs a big difference between James Wiseman and Deni Avidja in potential."
"Players are always available if you have the savvy skills to actually pull off the trade. Bucks got Grayson Allen for free. You‚Äôre telling me the Warriors couldn‚Äôt get a good player if they offered their draft picks and Wiseman? You can always get certain players if you‚Äôre willing to pay the price, your team didn‚Äôt even attempt to do that as your FO made it clear they‚Äôre fine with the young pieces. They literally went public and said that.   Exactly he had no experience so that‚Äôs a dumb move to play him when you have prime Curry, you literally wasted one of his best seasons by keeping Wiseman instead of making a trade. Yeah by then Curry is two years older. With an all star instead you don‚Äôt miss last years playoffs and the West was wide open with injuries, that was a big flop of a season and they did Curry wrong by making those decisions. There‚Äôs a reason even Draymond expressed some frustration with having rookies."
I‚Äôd love to have a Grayson Allen   How‚Äôs his defense tho? Never really paid that much attention to him
"I promise you the Memphis Grizzlies would‚Äôve seriously considered a trade either involving JJJ or any of the high end role players they have. They literally gave away Grayson Allen for free. There are trades available the Warriors didn‚Äôt push for them hard enough and the FO made it clear they‚Äôre cool with keeping them so I really don‚Äôt believe they actually went and looked for trades.   Again makes no sense why you guys ride for your current FO so hard, they‚Äôre not the same people who got you Curry/Klay/Dray, not putting win now players around Curry is a mistake regardless of a 11-1 start. The playoffs is what matters and you don‚Äôt rely on rookies in the playoffs, that‚Äôs roster construction 101."

"You use the pick and Wiggins to get someone? Building a bench isn‚Äôt a multiple year long process like how you think. Lakers build a new one every year lol.

"&gt; I'm don't think I can accept that reasoning behind Luka's bad +- throughout the years.  It doesn't much matter whether you accept it or not.  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/e6dtz4/the_dallas_mavericks_have_a_lower_net_rating_with/  This is from 2 years ago. People had been bringing up all the same arguments about Luka's +/- being worse than with him off the court. And no one bought them back then either.  And all the people making similar arguments in this thread are wrong again too. on/off simply doesn't capture the complexity of rotation changes and substitution patterns, not for calculating an individual player's ""ability"" to elevate the team around him.  &gt;At what point does it become Luka's fault that he can't make lineups with him work well?  IDK maybe you should ask the Clippers, who got taken to 13 out of 14 games by Luka plus a Mavs roster that was objectively worse than LA at every rotation spot, over the last two playoffs.  Net rating on-off for evaluating a single player is a garbage metric and always has been.   &gt;The Bucks have a Net Rating of +15.3 when Giannis plays and -11.3 when he doesn't, for an on-off of 26.6. Donte has missed all 12 games, Brook has missed 11, Khris and Jrue have missed 6, Portis has missed 5. And he's still +15.3 even though he's played with Thanasis, Pat, Grayson Allen and Hill as the starting 5.  So what?"
"I'm don't think I can accept that reasoning behind Luka's bad +- throughout the years.  I mean I'm currently looking at Giannis playing without 3 or 4 starters out every game of the season, and the Bucks still have a very good Net Rating when he is on the floor.  The Bucks have a Net Rating of +15.3 when Giannis plays and -11.3 when he doesn't, for an on-off of 26.6. Donte has missed all 12 games, Brook has missed 11, Khris and Jrue have missed 6, Portis has missed 5. And he's still +15.3 even though he's played with Thanasis, Pat, Grayson Allen and Hill as the starting 5.  At what point does it become Luka's fault that he can't make lineups with him work well? He's the primary ball-handler and the player that runs the whole offense."
I actually have a success story. My travel team got blitzed still but I scored on Grayson Allen more than a few times. And he scored on me back much more than that lol.
It's becoming less differing as Grayson Allen is balling out but Donte DiVincenzo isn't a starting caliber player and he won't get his starting spot back at any point in the season when he returns from injury. He's just way too inconsistent on offense as opposed to Grayson Allen.
How do you think Bucks fans feel about having Grayson Allen?
Thank you Grayson Allen
Fuck Grayson Allen
I fucking love this dude!  I'm over here trying to wind down as I fall asleep since I work in the morning. Instead Luka hits this fucking insane shot and now I'm here shitposting because I'm way too hyped to sleep.  Side note: fuck Grayson Allen
"Replay of the two missed free trows by Grayson ""Trippin"" Allen.  https://twitter.com/gifdsports/status/1382546226944618497"
"This one really calls for the classic Peanuts ""How did the other team feel"" comic strip.  And prayers up for Grayson Allen, the man who Nick Anderson'd this moment into happening."
I also say fuck Grayson Allen
Fuck grayson allen!! Im actually happy GO LUKA!!!!

"FUCK YOU, GRAYSON ALLEN  FUCK YOU."
I‚Äôm a fan of Ja but not necessarily a Grizz fan so I will proudly say fuck Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen played really well
You see him laughing after missing both FTs cuz he thought it didn‚Äôt matter? Hahaha get fucked Grayson Allen!
Grayson Allen sold
That‚Äôs apparently asking a lot of Grayson Allen. They should have asked him to trip somebody he would have converted that no problem
Grayson Allen frantically driving around Memphis texting people for Grayson Allen's address.
"One of the top comments in the Luka game winner thread is ""FUCK GRAYSON ALLEN"""
Grayson Allen
I hate Grayson Allen so this is perfect
Grayson Allen won the game.......   For the mavs
"BUT AT THE SAME TIME, FUCK HIM FOR BEING GRAYSON ALLEN/TED CRUZ'S BASTARD."
NAH IM DM'ING GRAYSON ALLEN HIS OWN ADDRESS
Fuck Grayson Allen.
Now you see why you can't have Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen slander delicious
[Haha fuck Grayson Allen](https://youtu.be/qhy68s3xJ00)
But Grayson Allen already killed you
"This fucking guy, man. That‚Äôs some wizardry right there.   Also, props to Grayson Allen on the choke-job. Dude was such a POS at Duke, I‚Äôve never forgiven him."
As someone who has no strong feelings about Grayson Allen one way or another: https://i.imgur.com/zGHQb4O.gif?2
Fuck Grayson Allen
"Crazy finish. First Grayson Allen, a 90% free throw shooter btw, misses both free throws which would have given the Grizzlies a 4pt lead. SOMEHOW missed both. THEN THIS. Luka almost doesn‚Äôt get the shot off in time, but floats it up just behind the line for the game winning 3. Unbelievable"
Grayson Allen won't sleep today for missing two crucial Freethrow
Grayson Allen is the new Alec Peters
Grayson Allen*
I feel like Luka makes that shot way more often than Grayson Allen misses two free throws in a row.
"This years playoffs, game 7, same situation but replace Grayson Allen with Paul George. Would be the top post all time"
Mavs Player of the Game: Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen smiling after missing two free throws...I was like you ain‚Äôt gonna be smiling when Luka wins this shit lmao
Please kill me and Grayson Allen
LUKA IS INSASNE. I cant believe Grayson Allen missed both free throws though
U already know Skip gonna bring up Grayson ‚Äú91%‚Äù Allen choking and giving ‚Äúthe worst clutch shooter‚Äù in the league a chance to win it
"Fucking knew it was coming too. The universe is truly good, not letting Grayson Allen have a perfect game."
I was THIS close to turning this game off when Grayson Allen got fouled... thank God I kept watching üéâüòÇ
wtf Grayson Allen 90% FT shooter misses both  we'll take it
Grayson Allen choking brings a smile to my face
Are you talking about Grayson Allen or Luka?
"What a tough end after a great night by Grayson Allen, played so well too"
"If anyone is going to miss FT‚Äôs to lose the game, I wouldn‚Äôt want it to be anyone else but Grayson Allen"
"One of the most bizarre game winners I've ever watched live, almost didn't feel real.. adding Grayson Allen missing both FT's to this.. Memphis must feel sick."
Deserved for Grayson Allen don't think we forgot
"As a Tar Heel and Mavericks fan, can I get a, ‚ÄúFUCK GRAYSON ALLEN!‚Äù!?"
FUCK GRAYSON ALLEN
GRAYSON ALLEN IS ABSOLUTELY NOT CLUTCH
Luka just showed Grayson Allen what it is to be a clutch player at a young age.
Grayson Allen is insanely unclutch
Grayson Allen thank you so much
F in the chat for Grayson Allen ... Karma for tripping people all those years
Fucking Grayson Allen misses 2 FTs into that three from Luka. I'd be starting the car in the garage rn if I was a Memphis fan.
Wait.. I kind of love Grayson Allen right now though?
FUCK GRAYSON ALLEN
SHOUT OUT TO GRAYSON ALLEN THIS WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT HIM
I knew I hated Grayson Allen for a reason. Brooo. Cmon.
"Close game, Grayson Allen choke and some Luka magic??? This is my favorite game in a while."
 Big props to Grayson Allen for missing those two shots. Let's get that 6th seed.
I hate Ted Cruz and Grayson Allen
Poor Grayson Allen :(
Fucking Grayson Allen cost us a lottery pick.
Grayson Allen missed two free throws and cost his team the game? You REALLY hate to see it lmfao
Grayson Allen gonna have nightmare about this
"Grayson Allen choked! Holy shit, I'm gonna cum!"
Yo FUCK Grayson Allen lmao lfg lukaaaaa

Grayson Allen missed two free throws and cost his team the game? You REALLY hate to see it lmfao
"Holy shit. What a shot...but also, how did Grayson Allen miss two FT‚Äôs lol"

THANK YOU GRAYSON ALLEN
Grayson Allen is a joke
Grayson Allen is ayusssss
FUCK GRAYSON ALLEN

Grayson Allen in shambles

TIL Grayson Allen is a 90% ft shooter  wtf?
"People don‚Äôt seem to like Jeff Teague, Paul George, Russell Westbrook, Grayson Allen, Gobert, Wiggins (b4 this year), Pat Bev, Herro, Pascal and sometimes Lowry."
Grayson Allen looks like hawkeye
"Most hated by fans  KD, Harden, Simmons, Draymond, Kyrie, Drummond, Embiid, Russ  Other players  Bev, Rondo, CP3, Kelly Olynik, Grayson Allen"
"Fuck Grayson Allen, all my homies hate Grayson Allen"
Pat Bev or Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen turning out to be a good NBA player is such a hilarious outcome. You can‚Äôt help but respect it.
Grayson Allen going off on a national TV game... I‚Äôm sure this will go over well around here
Grayson Allen freaky friday‚Äôd JJ Redick
Mavs should trade Luka and KP for Grayson Allen
Don‚Äôt bring up Grayson Allen around here
"Grayson ""Ray"" Allen"
Can we fucking guard Grayson Allen
I said the same thing when grayson Allen got a career high of 40 two years ago.
I really thought Grayson Allen would be the same player he was in college. He was absolutely hated. He fit into the NBA way better than I expected...
"Mike Dunleavy.  Not as popular of a name, but does anyone even like the dude?  He was on my team and i don‚Äôt like him lol.  More recently Grayson Allen."
Kyle Singler could play a scandanavian vampire in a teen romance flick starring Grayson Allen
"&gt;u/eaglefangkarate99  If I had to come up with a ""grayson allen"" reddit username... this would be it.  EDIT: lmfao this guy posts exclusively on /r/nba and team subs, and has made multiple grayson allen posts. If there was ever a ""burner"" conspiracy theory to be believed, it's this one."
To say nothing of Grayson Allen:  &gt;Joffrey  &gt;Not a bad guy  &gt;misunderstood  These are the biggest holes in your argument
"grayson allen has full youtube compilations of him being a dumbass dirty player, he doesn't get the benefit of the doubt lol i hate when people bring him up like it's the same shit"
ok but grayson allen is actually a dirty player with a reputation for doing shit like that already in his short career lol why would I give a douchebag like him the benefit of the doubt as opposed to a veteran like hill who's been in the league for years and has no history of being dirty
"It was dirty. This is the one time r/nba has ever sided with a player for making a dirty play but if you take off your blinders and if it happened to any other player you'd agree it was dirty.  Hill knows LeBron is about to land his feet next to him as he's coming down so he extends the back of his body unnaturally to get into Bron's landing space. If everyone dove for the ball that way we'd have a billion high ankle sprains, but obviously no one ever cleanly dives for the ball that way.  This sub is fucking garbage. Literally any other time a player's done something even questionably reckless it was in a tizzy, but they're contrarians when it happened here for some reason. When Grayson Allen barely tripped Trae and it led to no injury to the point where Trae cried on social media they went up in flames."
"Just like Grayson Allen with Trae to the point where Trae had to cry about it on Twitter, right?"
"Grizzlied were sorely missing Grayson Allen who would have been their second defender on Steph. Also their best 3 point shooter, too."
Fuck Grayson Allen tho
Grayson Allen ugly asf lmao we gotta stop calling every single white NBA player handsome its just not true
Grayson Allen makes this a different game /s
Where is Grayson Allen?
"There‚Äôs actually a decent amount of shooting but JJJ still is a funky fit with the roster this season coming back about 11-12 games ago. Grizz were in a groove somewhat and it‚Äôs messed with lineup and roles bad for the bench. Same thing with trying out Winslow at pg.   Grizz are missing grayson who‚Äôs the best pure shooter next to Bane. The problem is more Brooks being hot/cold and taking shots regardless. It‚Äôs really if Ja gets consistently above league average. Tyus, Melton, Bane, Allen, JJJ (last year) can all stroke it decently well."
I will fight Grayson Allen.   I'll lose. But ill fight him
"haha yes, that's an understatement. He was considered Grayson Allen at Duke tier. VC especially called him out for constantly trying to sprain his ankles"
Took me way too long to figure out.  WCJr = Wendell Carter Jr  MB3 = Marvin Bagley (does anyone call him this?)  Allen = Grayson Allen I'm guessing
"That bookcase tho:  * One Dunked Over the Cuckoo's Nest    * Glenn Robinson Crusoe    * Diary of a Wimpy Kidd    * A Song of Dunks and Fire    * 50 Shades of Grayson Allen    * The Secret Passages of Castle Clippers    * Cloudy With a Chance of Airballs    * Hop on Popovich    * A Tale of Two Dinwiddies    * All Quiet in the Western Conference    * War and Metta World Peace    * 7 Seconds or Less    * The Shammgod Delusion    * The Selfish Jeanie    * Behind the Back    * The Count of Monta Ellis    * A Dance with Dragic    * A Wrinkle in Time Outs    * Catcher in the Ryan Anderson    * Thousand Phoenix Suns    * The Lobbit    * Melo and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Season    * As I Layup Dying    * Tuesdays with Morey    * Greak Freakonomics     * Infinite Rest by Greg Popovich (when Leonard was still on the team)    * 7 Seconds or Less * A Clockwork Orange     * The Draymond Green Mile    * Life of QI     * The Brothers Karamazovgov   The difference between D&amp;D's, ""Here's your slop, now eat it,"" and this painstaking attention to detail for a frame on camera for under 5 seconds."
##Grayson Allen
Cut it out. They gave Grayson Allen 2 gimme‚Äôs to lose the game
Tillman shot was clutch as fuck  Grayson Allen hit some big shots too
Lmao Grayson Allen turned out to be clutch
Kinda Crazy that Grayson Allen had the most points in OT
B in Warriors stands for ball security.   They lost to rookies and Grayson Allen
"Grizzlies coach EXTREMELY lucky they ended up sneaking out with a win. Seriously, why would you not challenge that leg kick out in the 4th? Potentially save 3 FTs, it's under 2 minutes, the Warriors are on a scoring streak. It's like the perfect scenario to use your challenge!  Also, Ja Morant is a baaaaaad man. And apparently Grayson Allen is the greatest 3pt shooter ever?"
No one likes Grayson Allen
Giving up back to back 3‚Äôs to Grayson Allen also fucked it up for the Warriors
"Oh god if this were Grayson Allen, the salt. Breakaway dunk to cap off steph's exit."
Booo. Fuck you Grayson Allen lol
NOT SORRY LMAO GRAYSON ALLEN &gt; STEPHEN CURRY
Grizzlies legend Grayson allen
"""Grayson Allen saves the game"" is not a sentence I expected in 2021, but respect this was pretty insane actually"

Grayson Allen level jerk
Grayson Allen dropped a 40 point game in his last game as a member of the Jazz.
??? I can still call a weak player a weak player. The way the entire Lakers team acts is weak. They're one of the best teams in the league while simultaneously the least fun to watch because of their whining and weakness. It's sad because they could be the most entertaining team if they just chilled out. Instead they're whinier than grayson allen at duke.
"Devin ""Grayson Allen"" Booker"
Grayson allen does this? Man...
"Totally justifies drawing a foul by tripping, Mr. Grayson Allen."
LOL it still baffles me how CP3 can be held in such high regard by other NBA players. He‚Äôs been doing shit like this since his Wake Forest days and he‚Äôs the president of the player‚Äôs union?   Grayson Allen is rightfully seen as a shit eater but you can‚Äôt tell me CP3 hasn‚Äôt been doing the same petty dangerous stuff for over a decade and a half now.
"Grayson Allen ""He stole my whole fucking flow!"""
More talented Grayson Allen*
Imagine if Grayson Allen tries to pull this stunt. CP is dirty man.
This isn‚Äôt the first time he‚Äôs done emotional shit when he‚Äôs losing. Dude is a poor man‚Äôs Grayson Allen

Grayson Allen ass bitch
Cool who gets to fight Grayson Allen?
"I feel like I'm the only one that thinks all this chanting isn't all that entertaining and is kind of gross. I'd understand if it was directed towards someone like Grayson Allen, but it feels like ""fuck you"" chants and balding chants are a but much."
I'm absolutely positive I could taken on Grayson Allen 7-8/10 times
If Grayson Allen was as good as Trae is nickname would most definitely be the Zodiac Killa
Grayson Allen -23
"If you want to talk polarizing personalities, imagine if Grayson Allen was as good as Trae.."
How do Grizzlies fans feel about Grayson Allen? Curious if he's become a better dude since college
Because Grayson Allen isn‚Äôt good enough to care and everyone else on the team is pretty likable.
Grayson Allen with that 0-6 -23   Oof
"Yep, this game's over. Grayson Allen needs more help"
Why is grayson allen still in this game
Except for Grayson Allen. I personally like the guy but he gets **HEAT!**
Yup. Grayson about to get his comeuppance and then Bane walks out from behind the bleachers and stands behind Allen menacingly
Grayson Allen the lesbian orangutan
grayson allen gives no fucks.  true zodiac killer
Why do Desmond Bane and Grayson Allen look like the bullies in a afterschool special

Grayson Allen looks like Hawkeye from wish
Grayson Allen already has gray hair üòÇ
Odds on Grayson Allen going Grayson Allen on Mitchell feel high.
Grayson Allen in already?
Dillion Brooks &amp; Grayson Allen are the two most punchable faces in the league
Grayson Allen gonna catch some strays in this thread
"Then use your fucking hands. He straight up hockey checked the man. If you can catch up enough to put your shoulder into him, then you can lift your fucking arm to foul.  And what about when Noel tripped Trae Young from behind a la prime Grayson Allen douchery?"
"In this scenario we would be moving JJJ too. I love Melton but even with a shot he's still worth moving for a star wing who is gonna be a plus defender anyways. Dillon Brooks and JV can't take turns being the second best player and expect to win anything. Melton's contract is so good because it is so tradable. I'd rather move Grayson Allen(if he extends) tho don't get me wrong but order of untouchability goes imo is Brooks, Bane, Melton, Konchar then Allen."
Man on that Grayson Allen shit
So does this mean that the Grizzlies are going to win several championships because they have grayson allen and dillon brooks?
Not trying to get tripped by Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen isn't even the best shooter on his team
Ray Allen didn‚Äôt trip people and like a bitch. Also he was way better at everything than Grayson Allen
fuck grayson allen
"On ball he‚Äôs good, maybe even very good. Off ball he falls asleep a lot and even cost us a game or two (open Grayson Allen 3 to lose it comes to mind).   But he was a solid defender against the Bucks and they even opted to hunt CP3 instead."
Grayson Allen was too busy
Trade for Grayson Allen to take out kawhi‚Äòs knee again next year.
"That dirty bitch Dwyane Wade.  As much as other players annoy me like Lebron or Lowry whining to the referees, it's players that have actually tried to injure players on my favorite team. Wade did just that when he pulled down Rondo in a non-basketball play and [*dislocated his freaking elbow.*](https://youtu.be/he4OY6gJNX4)   Goran Dragic, Grayson Allen, and - shocker - Kyle Lowry also come to mind when thinking of guys that have made dirty plays against the Celtics. Fascinating that there's a common thread with THREE guys listed in my comment.  (hint: it must be HeAt CuLtUrE)"
"Maybe Grizzlies cause Bledsoe isn't gonna play for us this season. Also got 3 first rounders next year and expiring rotation pieces in Tyus Jones, Kyle Anderson, and Grayson Allen."
Grayson Allen. He just screams *sneaky little bastard.*
"Eric Bledsoe, Grayson Allen, Tyus Jones UTA 22, LAL 22, MEM 22 and GSW 24. Call it in :P"
Grayson Allen is scum. He has a history of trying to inure people. Lots of videos around..
Worst to score 40?  Grayson Allen
"What? this sub hates people equally, they hate grayson allen for example. There isn‚Äôt as many white players in the NBA and young stars like Luka and Tatum have no reason to get hate."
"PG Steph   SG Booker   SF Durant   PF Ben Simmons   Center Rudy Gobert    Bench: Grayson Allen, Zaza,Jae Crowder"
They should trade both of them to the Grizzlies for Grayson Allen and Brandon Clarke
"**PG:** Ja Morant, De'Anthony Melton, Tyus Jones.   **SG:** Dillon Brooks, Desmond Bane, Grayson Allen.   **SF:** Kyle Anderson, Ziaire Williams.  **PF:** Jaren Jackson Jr, Brandon Clarke, Santi Aldama.   **C:** Steven Adams, Xavier Tillman.   That's excluding Bledsoe."
Grayson Allen: character actor that ONLY plays fratboy date rapists
Grayson Allen - Pizza Delivery Boy
I‚Äôd rather draft Kuminga at 7 if available. He‚Äôll be worth more than Grayson Allen and Moody imo
You're dreaming if you think that's gonna happen. Bane and 10 is likely the best deal that the Grizzlies could get to move up for #7.  Why would the Warriors want Grayson Allen when they already have Steph and Klay coming back? They'll want a bigger wing who can play the 3 to pair with them and Allen isn't that.
"Counter offer: Tyus Jones, Grayson Allen, and a lifetime subscription to US Weekly"
"the grizzlies do have a bit of a log jam at the 2 though, between bane, melton, grayson allen, and dillon brooks (though he can play some 3, he‚Äôs suited to playing at least some minutes at the 2), there really aren‚Äôt quite enough minutes to go around. if the grizz really want kuminga and see him being available at 7, i can see this trade happening for sure"
And that space is worth more than Grayson Allen.
"Lmao, dumbest me forgot Grayson Allen existed and thought there's no way Tony Allen is still playing."
"There's no misunderstanding with Grayson Allen, the guy was committing dirty fouls in summer league."
"People cared more about college basketball when JJ Redick was at Duke and he was seemingly good forever back then, so him.   However, the amount people deservedly hated Grayson Allen gives him the greater hater efficiency ratio."
"Grayson Allen was picking fights in the Summer League, dude seems like an absolute tool"
"We arent trading Clarke. Its Grayson Allen, Tyrus Jones, or Kyle Anderson."
Moses Moody reminds me of a lite Malik Monk coming out of college. He doesn't excel at driving to the lane. How many top SG's can you name who aren't good at driving/finishing in the lane. We already have Grayson Allen who can play that role for cheap
I think Kyle Anderson is too good to be included in this unless the Kings are giving up a first(which they should not do). But at the same time he's an expiring so idk(I still wouldnt include him though).   Maybe you put in Grayson Allen because he only has 1 yr left on his rookie deal and they might not want to compete with whatever offer sheet someone gives him next summer. I guess same situation as Slo Mo
Warriors have the 7th. Grizzlies have a Warriors future 1st and Grayson Allen and Brandon Clarke to sweeten the deal.
"Not surprised, a backcourt of Ja, Bledsoe, brooks would really need Grayson Allen/Desmond bane to have any type of spacing"
"What's the deal with Bledsoe? Don't the Grizzlies now have Bledsoe, Melton, Tyus, and Grayson Allen?"
"Moving JJJ to centre, maybe?  **PG:** Ja Morant, Eric Bledsoe, De'Anthony Melton, Tyus Jones.   **SG:** Dillon Brooks, Grayson Allen.   **SF:** Kyle Anderson, Desmond Bane.   **PF:** Jaren Jackson Jr, Brandon Clarke.   **C:** Steven Adams, Xavier Tillman.   Looking at that:  1. I'm not sure they're finished, and maybe they're going to package some young players, picks and a contract to get one more starter?  2. If they keep the 10th pick and intend to move JJJ to centre, maybe they take Jalen Johnson and try to make him their PF?"
We‚Äôd probably get a future pick back or a player like Grayson Allen or somebody like that back too.
&gt;Pels getting Grayson Allen  No no no *no no stop making me root for Duke players*
I dont think its a ruse. Rumors are we're high on Moses Moody. Going up 7 spots by only taking on Bledose's contract (which isnt terrible) and giving up Grayson Allen (who we likely weren't going to resign) would be worth it. 10 gives us a shot at Moody or we could look to trade up again to get him by packaging 10 plus some players.
Grayson Allen must get a sexual release from tripping people. He loves getting reprimanded for it too ;)
Grayson Allen. Absolutely hated him in college and was mortified when the Jazz drafted him. I tried to come around for the one year he was on the team but luckily the Jazz traded him the next year for Conley.
Like what. Melton's already locked up and Bane is entering his second season. Talk about over thinking it. If we want to keep Grayson Allen after this season he's a RFA
"I think Kenrich Williams is a playable guy that the Thunder could offer if they needed to. Kenrich shot better from 3, had a higher FG%, and is a better defender in my opinion. It also doesn‚Äôt help that Grayson Allen is a RFA after the season so he can only be a bargain for at most a year, Kenrich isn‚Äôt a FA until 2 seasons from now."
"The rumors I‚Äôve heard involve the Pels getting Grayson Allen and, as much as I hate him, he‚Äôs not a terrible basketball player. The Thunder can‚Äôt really offer an actual playable player in return"
0 percent chance the Grizzlies are trading away Grayson Allen in this deal.
Grayson Allen would be proud‚Ä¶
"With great reluctance, and eternal appreciation for his heart, grit, grind, and most importantly CLASS, Grayson Allen. And maybe we'll throw in Konchar and Tyus, too. Enjoy them, Dubs fans. And you're welcome."
We not gonna pretend like OP didn‚Äôt just call Grayson Allen handsome
Grayson Allen stands alone as Captain of the All-TedCruzFaced Team.
Grayson Allen not being on this list is laughable. Dude looks like an infant.
Grayson Allen (fuck him btw)
"Grayson allen is a guaranteed hate, whether he‚Äôs suiting up for St. Francis &amp; Chorus of Angels or Lucifer &amp; the 5-headed demons of the underworld."
If you hate Grayson Allen but root for Chris Paul to win a ring you're a lost lost soul.
"Kris Dunn -&gt; Buddy Hield   Justin Patton -&gt; D.J. Wilson   Josh Okogie -&gt; Grayson Allen   Jarrett Culver -&gt; Coby White   Anthony Edwards -&gt; James Wisemen   Our draft lineup looks real rough‚Ä¶ seems like 4 out of the 5 picked one after us were upgrades.  Though, I‚Äôd say Ant over Wiseman offsets the difference since he‚Äôs already shown flashes of being a franchise player, especially during the second half of his rookie season."
"I don't think they've gotten weaker, but they haven't really gotten better either.  The only real playoff impact player lost was PJ Tucker.  Bryn Forbes was big in the regular season but disappeared after the Miami series.  The Bucks are deeper at guard this year though.  George Hill is a huge improvement over Jeff Teague as a backup PG and we also added Grayson Allen to the SG rotation.  The front office didn't have much to work with to improve the team this year though they could've brought PJ back had they wanted.  Supposedly letting PJ go saved $20 million in tax penalties.  I think the trade deadline and next years offseason will signal the true intent of the owners.  I do feel like they're going to want to get under the tax soon though to avoid the repeater tax getting too high."
"There isn't a comparison, which is kind of the point. He hasn't had the chance to prove himself so we don't know. He could be great or he could be a choker.  What Ja has proven is despite not being a great defender, he can be the starting point guard of the team with the 7th best defensive rating in the NBA (while starting alongside Grayson Allen of all people). He's proven that he can drop 47 in a playoff game, and he doesn't shy away from big names like Steph.   Until I see it from Fox, give me the guy I KNOW is cash money."
"The dude told our FO to draft Grayson Allen after his rookie season lmao, GMitchell is old news"
Love that guy. My favorite player next to grayson allen.
"&gt; Memphis who have log jams at the guard position, they even practically gave away Grayson Allen.  Because of course someone like Grayson Allen is worth a lotto pick. Trades are possible but wasting your top assets for someone like Eric Bledsoe is just dumb.   &gt; Nope. Kuminga is extremely raw, Wiseman had one of the if not the worst rookie season ever for someone playing the minutes he was and Wiggins is extremely overrated.  If you actually watched around the NBA you‚Äôd know Kuminga is not as raw as advertised. He has already shown great IQ. Needs refinement but this isn‚Äôt some full time project. Apparently you‚Äôre not patient with young players so I pray for Scottie Barnes cuz you‚Äôll be calling him a bust after 1 month. Bigs normally suck year 1. That‚Äôs just how it goes. Now this big was thrown into the fire for a team with a difficult scheme trying to make the playoffs and he didn‚Äôt have a training camp. He‚Äôll be fine but yeah he is raw, it will take 1 to 2 seasons but he‚Äôll be a good to great player. Wiggins is underrated not overrated. He played nothing like his Minny years, he was efficient and a great defender. Is he worth 30 mil? No. But he is worth 20-24."
"Nope. Kuminga is extremely raw, Wiseman had one of the if not the worst rookie season ever for someone playing the minutes he was and Wiggins is extremely overrated.  If you actually kept up with the league you would see there are teams like Memphis who have log jams at the guard position, they even practically gave away Grayson Allen.  Trades are 100% possible, your FO is just not that good. They are disrespecting Curry hard."
"Pretty sure all Grizzlies hate Trae cause he's beefed with Grayson Allen and DB. Ja may be intentionally snubbing him.  Or not and I'm just a drama monger, but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
Grayson Allen maybe....he had a 40 point game his rookie season in a meaningless end of season game where the jazz sat all their starters
"Grayson Allen had exactly 1 20 point game before he had a 40 point game.  His 20 point game was 2 games before too, so it was a near thing."
Planet Pat‚Äôs 3PT barrage featuring gRAYson ALLEN.
Grayson Allen has been surprising me this yr
and Cole Anthony and Grayson Allen and Terrance Ross and the entire Toronto Raptors
Pat and Grayson Allen the new Splash Bros you heard it here first.
"gRAYson ALLEN. It's been right there the while time, we just never realized it."
Grayson allen turned into Ray allen
"Grayson ""clutch"" allen"
Are Pat Connaughton and Grayson Allen the GOAT backcourt duo?
Planet Pat and gRAYson ALLEN carrying the lads
Grayson Allen &gt; the knicks franchise
"Grayson ""Bryn ""Steph Curry"" Forbes"" Allen"
"you're asking for quiet. So outside of fantasy basketball, where it's a little more know, these are the guys responsive to the question:  bobby portis mo bamba gary trent jr. John Collins Dejounte Harris Tyrese Haliburton Wendell Carter Jr Grayson Allen cole anthony richaun holmes tyrese maxey  Not listing mobley, scottie barnes, harrison barnes, miles bridges, carmelo, and some others since they've definitely been talked about a lot."
"Bucks stock is still high. Maybe they dipped a smidge because of recent FUD, but they've had anywhere from 3-4 starters and a few rotation players injured or COVID out for most of the season so far. They were starting Giannis with Grayson Allen, George Hill, Bobby Portis, and now Jrue Holiday. Thanasis and Connaughton started games too, and their Scrabble bench got a bunch of minutes. It's obvious they won't play at the level of their current record but people still think there's actually a dip smh."
I think Bucks fans are realizing the asset that Grayson Allen is to the team after the initial reaction to his signing (and the hatred so many of felt toward him as Wisconsin fans).
remember when grayson allen as a redshirt freshman single handily scored 12 straight points to bring back duke from 10 down in the championship with 6 minutes to go? Remember when he followed that season up averaging 24 a game on 47 % shooting and 42% from 3 while taking 6.4 a game? He would've been a top 10 pick had he came out that season. He did this all while in the fuckin ACC lol. Donte's college career doesn't compare. Grayson has one of the purest releases in the league he always has. He also has a 42 inch vertical lmfao
"This is what I never understood. You have people hitting and kicking people in the nuts consistently but hate someone that tripped a few people in college. As a Duke fan, I love Grayson Allen for his 4 years there. He was always a hard worker and super intense on the court. Sure I think he‚Äôs a doofus for the tripping but he was a kid playing at a top 3 basketball school with a ton of pressure."
"There was [this](https://twitter.com/TheTraeYoung/status/1343269894268334080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1343269894268334080%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbleacherreport.com%2Farticles%2F2924303-trae-young-posts-video-of-grayson-allen-appearing-to-trip-him-this-gotta-stop) which some people think was deliberate. To me his first step just accidentally comes down between his teammate and Trae's foot, and the second step is a result of his foot being caught on Trae."
"""Grayson Allen lead all players in 'plus/minus' at +18.   ^(Royce O'Neale also had +18"")"
"Grayson ""Joffrey Baratheon"" Allen is having a good season for the bucks!"
"Name's Grayson Allen, Grayson stands for Gangsta Ray Son-of-a-b Allen"
What happened here? Was Drummond supposed to be guarding Giannis? I'm guessing he wasn't supposed to be guarding Grayson Allen.
"The timing will have that effect! Honestly I like Grant but I'm just glad i was able to get rid of Wiggins and Bam and managed to get my favorite player, PG, and a hot hand in Grayson Allen"
"Grayson Allen might overtake Donte Divincenzo starting spot even when Donte comes back. He can really shoot the ball and can do way more on offense than Donte.   His game really reminds me of Eric Gordon, despite all the cliche of JJ Redick comp (white SG from Duke) that people throw at him coming into the league"
"Do you think people wouldn't have reacted differently if Jokic did the same thing to idk Grayson Allen, who's also a known shithouse?"
"Traded Bam, Jerami grant, and the corpse of Andrew Wiggins for PG and Grayson Allen today before the games, you can still snag him my friend üí™üèΩüí™üèΩ"
"We were down 2. Grayson Allen is the starting shooting guard now. Donte, while I love him, isn't getting that job back"
Only Grayson Allen can find a way to be whiter than a ginger
"Grayson Allen always had the talent to be a good player. He was just a bonehead, glad to him producing for a contending team"
NGL didn‚Äôt expect grayson Allen to be good in the NBA lol
"The dirty players like the morrii, pat bev, Grayson Allen etc all will.  The league basically just said it‚Äôs open season with no punishment for injury hunting. Why would the dirty players who already headhunt take it any differently?"
"damn maxey looked real good tonight, i've always been high on both him and quick but tyrese's second year jump has been beyond what i expected. obviously defensively he'll never sniff simmons but offensively this kid is already really good and his aggressiveness is just what philly needs. grayson allen too... bucks bot their bogi-esque player."
Is that [this](https://twitter.com/TheTraeYoung/status/1343269894268334080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1343269894268334080%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbleacherreport.com%2Farticles%2F2924303-trae-young-posts-video-of-grayson-allen-appearing-to-trip-him-this-gotta-stop)? How is this not just running?
"Grayson Allen is looking like a perfect fit for the Bucks.   Once everyone is back, Milwaukee is gonna be scary"
&gt; Grayson Allen Evolution  quick someone make an animorph with grayson turning into ted cruz
Fuck I hate Grayson Allen he‚Äôs a sniper
How many Alley Oop attempt did the sixers stop by grabbing Giannis ? 3 ? 4? That's was kinda funny to watch. If Grayson Allen keep it up his contract is a steal
That was the first time I heard Grayson Allen speak
Never have I thought that Grayson Allen would help a Wisconsin basketball team.  Dude just flat out shoots so well
gRAYson ALLEN
"There's a timeline where the Bucks don't trade for Grayson Allen and in that timeline I would have stopped watching this team play Basketball and lead a fulfilling, happy, life."
I‚Äôm sure Grayson Allen is a really lovely guy but man I wanna punch him and his Kate Gosselin haircut in the face so bad
"I really hate how much I'm starting to like Grayson Allen. Man, do I like that haircut."
God damn it‚Ä¶ the bucks have made me like Grayson Allen‚Ä¶.
"This game has to be really encouraging if you‚Äôre a Sixers fan. They really battled with so many guys out and Maxey looked like a star.   As a Bucks fan, Grayson Allen has looked great this year, I love Giannis and I‚Äôm ready for Khris and Brook to come back."
Grayson Allen is the best SG in the league
Imagine rooting for Grayson Allen lol
"Regardless of him hitting 3's for your team, imagine liking Grayson Allen"
Lord Allen of Grayson! üôå
fuck it. grayson allen jersey ordered.
GRAYSON ALLEN IS THAT DUDE
Grayson Allen gives me sociopath vibes.
"Trust me Reggie, you don't want to see ""everything"" Grayson Allen is capable of on the court."
Grayson Allen is surprisingly useful in the NBA
you just know it sucks playing against Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen
"Was not at all a Grayson Allen fan before he came to the Bucks, didn't love that we signed him just because of his reputation, but I have to say, he's been a very good and clean player since I've been watching him on Milwaukee. Hope he's grown up and can keep contributing."
And 1 on Grayson allen
"Grayson allen, the only member of the 2015 duke title team that doesnt blow"
I‚Äôm surprised Grayson Allen is playing well and not trying to kill the opposition‚Äôs players
Grayson Allen is the only bright spot of our season so far. And he makes Donte expendable.
Has Irving responded to all the support he‚Äôs been getting from Grayson Allen on his decision not to get vaccinated?
gRAYson Allen
"You mean like Grayson Allen, who still plays dirty?"
"I had a Bucks fan claim Grayson Allen isn't a piece of shit, which may be r/nba's all-time funniest joke"
"Just realized Grayson Allen is the ""Bucks piece of trash human at shooting guard"" successor to Mike Dunleavy Jr."
Grayson Allen
"I think a way to make it even more fun would be to allow free hard fouls on known dirty players.  Let players get their shots in on the Pat Bev, the Morris twins, Zaza, Dahntay Jones, Chris Paul, Delly, Kelly Olynyk, Draymond, and Grayson Allen type players once a game without punishment. I condone it."
"Ejection for arguing foul calls isn‚Äôt the same as having a ‚Äúhistory‚Äù like Grayson Allen, pat bev, Bruce Bowen etc"
"Do you really think that if Grayson Allen had done the same thing to Giannis or Embiid, and then got shoved in the back, that people would be taking Allen's side?"
Then why does Grayson Allen get so much hate?
"Jokic is an emotional player. But he‚Äôs not dirty. The closest thing to a dirty play in his history is either the ‚Äúhard box out‚Äù on kanter (which is nothing) or when he caught Payne in the nose with his bicep when swatting at a ball.  Jokic retaliated here, but he doesn‚Äôt instigate or target guys like Morris and pat bev and Grayson Allen and those types of dirty players do."
GRAYSON ALLEN OK
"Grayson Allen, everyone's favorite player!"
 GRAYSON ALLEN üòÇ
Grayson Allen back to back threes is the absolute last thing everyone watching this game wanted
I hate when Grayson Allen plays well dude
GRAYSON ALLEN CANNOT MISS!!

GRAYSON ALLEN WHAT THE FUCK
Wow Grayson Allen clutch
I still remember when Grayson Allen was one of the best players in that 2015 NCAA title game
I hate Grayson allen
Grayson Allen has big jerk energy
Fuck Grayson Allen.
that or the Grayson Allen block. They just threw away the game
"Even that Grayson Allen/Green challenge earlier would have been great, add a foul to the Warriors early and get two free throws."
Jordan pool got the same call Grayson Allen was called for an offence of foul.
I do too. How's Grayson Allen been lately? I couldn't get into the Grizzlies because I hate that turd but I LOVE Ja Morant with a passion
"Didn't Grayson Allen travel? took like 4 steps after receiving the ball, stopped and then drove in..."
Bruh you can't hate on Jazz legend Grayson Allen.
I'm not sure there's anyone I'm happier to see fail than Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen sucks.
Grayson Allen is ruining everything!
"I think that's a block, but I feel dirty supporting Grayson Allen"
Fuck Grayson Allen.
"This Grayson Allen fella isn't too good, is he?"
Grayson Allen is on the floor for tripping purposes only he is garbage
"Grayson Allen vs Draymond Green, who do we dislike more?"
That‚Äôs a charge because refs hate Grayson Allen lol
Why the fuck is Grayson Allen playing lol
What does Grayson Allen even do? Is he a shooter or something? I haven‚Äôt seen him do anything.
Do y'all realize we're having to depend on Grayson Fucking Allen because JV has 10000 fouls?
Fuck off let me laugh at Grayson Allen
"Grayson Allen? The dude who was kicking players in the nuts at Duke, apologizing then doing it again?"
"It‚Äôs usually pretty funny when an NBA player airballs, because they‚Äôre paid millions of dollars to put the ball in the basket and an airball isn‚Äôt even close. Usually gets a chuckle out of me  But when *Grayson Allen* is the player that airballs? That‚Äôs fucking HILARIOUS. Fuck him so hard lmfao"
lol what is grayson allen doing
I could watch that little punk Grayson Allen throw up airballs all day long
Grayson Allen tried to foul bait you not Trae young broüò≠
Get Grayson Allen out the fucking league
Grayson Allen is dogwater
Grayson Allen babyyy
Why is Grayson Allen still in the league
Grayson Allen that's not your shot lol
Grayson Allen is my favorite iso in the league outside Austin Rivers
Hahaha fuck Grayson Allen
Did Grayson Allen think he was Kobe lmao
"Grayson Allen is bad, what a terrible 3."
Grayson Allen has been a surprisingly benign NBA player after being the most hated college player in recent memory.
Grayson Allen swishing and Curry playing like shit is like a nightmare for /r/NBA
NBA offices crapping their pants at the idea of Grayson Allen knocking Steph out of their silly play in tournament
"What you talking about, he's playing against future Hall of Famer Grayson Allen"
Grayson Allen on Curry... RIP Curry's ankles
Grayson Allen is that dude.
Grayson Allen is lowkey a bucket
I forgot Grayson Allen existed. Now I hope the Grizzlies lose
Grayson skyfucker Allen baby
My god I hate watching Grayson Allen do anything right
Is Grayson Allen a better shooter than Steph? Maybe he just doesn't get enough opportunity?
Grayson Allen killing the Warriors right now
I can't believe I'm rooting for a team with Grayson Allen.  I feel unclean.
Oh shit Grayson allen still plays basketball ig I really don‚Äôt watch the Grizzlies
Refs refused to call the 3rd foul on Steph over Grayson Allen and still his open 3 went out. I still cannot believe Warriors are down considering how the officiating is going.
"I know, damn I‚Äôve been watching the Grizzlies a lot this season and haven‚Äôt seen him do anything wild so I was really hoping he was a changed man. I REALLY hated Grayson Allen"
Grayson Allen is playing hard
Man I hated Grayson Allen so much when he was at Duke. He seems to have calmed down a bit. I love this whole Memphis team though
GRAYSON ALLEN
What the fuck is Grayson Allen thinking with that neck-only beard?
"Don't know about you guys, but if I'm the Warriors as soon as I see JV sit with Grayson Allen still in, Steph is ready to get back in the game"
Grayson Allen playing in an elimination game? Grizzlies asking to lose.
Someone please hip check Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen IS NOT an NBA Player.
Is Grayson Allen hurt or does he not play because he's bad? Last I remember of him was when he got traded
Grayson Allen?
Fuck Grayson Allen
Luka - PG  Grayson Allen - SG  Gordon Hayward - SF  Sabonis - PF  Jokic - C
"Tacko fall, bol bol, lamelo ball, Lonzo ball, Grayson allen"
Grayson allen a -17 in 4:55 lol
"&gt;I‚Äôm sure Warriors fans would be laughing it off the same way they did last night  I don't really want to see players hurt, but the theater that would result from Memphis starting Grayson Allen and sending him after Curry's eyes -- which I'm sure Allen would do without hesitation if asked, and maybe if not -- would be entertaining as hell.  For the record, I don't think Grayson Allen should be allowed in the NBA, but he's there -- so if attacking an opponent's eyes is just a common foul, which the Warriors are okay with, then you might as well use him.  By the way, for the kids out there who aren't hold enough to remember, this type of play is why Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had to wear his trademark goggles.  Opponents could not stop him fairly, so they'd do whatever they could, including going after his eyes."
"&gt; League‚Äôs been letting him slide with this shit for years.  Yes and no.  He's been suspended three times already, and fined three-quarters of a million -- which he doesn't care about, but when you think about how small NBA conduct fines are, that means he's been busted a bunch of times.  There cannot be any serious debate that he's up there with Grayson Allen as the dirtiest players in the league, and he needs a serious suspension to send a message.  Imagine the penalties that would rain down if teams started going after Curry's eyes, like Green does."
"He's the hate sink. No one's ever gonna hate the Grizzlies, just Grayson Allen."
"Let's see how badly Memphis wants to make the playoffs.  If they really want to, maybe they go should after Curry's eyes.  That'd be worth a couple common fouls, no?  They do have Grayson Allen on the roster, and I'm sure he'd be willing.  Does anyone think those would not result in flagrants?"
Grayson Allen would like a word
Dillon Brooks and Grayson Allen are about to drop 70 combined on you
Grayson allen knocking bron out of the playoffs is poetic
I love Grayson allen but...yeah that was not the time
michael beasley and it isnt even close. edit: grayson allen too
Grayson Allen stopped playing and Memphis won...
Havent seen Grayson Allen in a while
"Honestly watching the Spurs on that entire run, just blame Grayson Allen. Sloppy ass defense and then hoisted bad shots."
That Grayson Allen plus minus tho
Grayson Allen sucking makes me so happy
I didn't know Grayson Allen played for San Antonio
I enjoy seeing Grayson Allen suck
Grayson Allen falling on his face there is his game in a nutshell
Kyle Anderson and Grayson Allen in the finals
"&gt;the man also dropped almost a 40 piece on trae young‚Äôs head.   As if this is hard to do.   Fuck Grayson Allen, anything he ever accomplished doesn‚Äôt count."
grayson allen will never be an nba starter
you need a new gimmick these Grayson Allen post are bad.
Fuck Grayson Allen. All my homies hate Grayson Allen.
Hey that's 'outscored Steph Curry in overtime of an elimination game' Grayson Allen.
Grayson allen?
"Grayson ""THE HITMAN"" Allen"
With all due respect. Michael Jordan would score 50 on Grayson Allen more often than he wouldn‚Äôt.
Grayson Allen a bitch
"Except the Jazz.  They booed Grayson Allen.  Draft the man, trade him and boo him.  Bigger grinches than Dillion.  Lol."
"He definitely raises the floor of players around him. JV, Grayson Allen, a lot of guys know they can relax and he will find them where they like to eat.  His distribution tendencies may put a ceiling on his accolades in this scoring over passing PG world. But it may raise his ceiling on how far he can go winningwise. His playoffs may be dominated by games where he is the 2nd or even 3rd leading scorer, but every game its a different scoring leader.   He also may be limited in season by minutes restriction, but we have seen that the Grizz will stretch his minutes in the postseason."
Wouldn't it be Grayson Allen vs. Trae?
"Yup. Mike Dunleavy Jr carved out a 14 year career and Grayson Allen is putting up very similar numbers. As long as Grayson Allen doesn't rub his teammates the wrong way, he's going to be just fine in that category of players you hate but tolerate/defend if they are on your team"
So.... Grayson Allen = Jordan?
Did you just say Grayson Allen will lock down Trae? Lmfao he just had one of the best playoff debuts of all-time while playing against an elite defensive team but you think Grayson Allen will stop him?
Grayson Allen doe
2018 also had Grayson Allen. He is the steal of the draft.
I mean he was just playing against Grayson Allen lol. Julius Randle? Patrick Beverly...
"Not that I know of. Probably it had to be something about being an athletic white dude.  Until he reached the league, he had never played against a crazier athlete.  Before Zion broke the vertical record at Duke, Grayson Allen held it."
Grayson Allen next up frfr
Genuine question: Do people like Grayson Allen now? All I know of him is that he was a little shit in college and didn't realize he was still in the NBA til a while ago. Has he gotten better as a person?
&gt;Grayson hits the game winning shot  hello grayson allen
This is such a weird question and yet the thing that stands out the most is how much you‚Äôre over valuing Grayson Allen.
"Majority of fans don't like Grayson Allen, your meme won't catch on."
"Did you not read the post, it was obviously from Grayson allen"
No it‚Äôs because Grayson Allen popped off
Idk why but I‚Äôm really rooting for Grayson Allen
I realized in this game my dislike for the Utah Jazz and their fans outweighs my dislike of Grayson Allen. Great win Grizz.
"Be honest, did you foresee Grayson Allen playing crunch time minutes in the playoffs?"
Mans had Grayson Allen looking like prime Wade
"Man I love this grizzly team - always liked Ky Anderson, Jonas having a career year, Ja proving to the fake fans that he‚Äôs a legitimate threat, Brooks with his patented energy and defense... only negative is Grayson Allen but I might just have to get over that one."
Grayson Allen has Ted Cruz face. That shot of his face was 100% Ted Cruz.
grayson allen with clutch defense
Grayson Allen is so useless.
This Grizzlies team almost has me rooting for Grayson Allen

Low key hoped Grayson Allen would be a bust but good for him
"Grayson Allen is very skillful tbh, very good shooter as well"
Why is Grayson Allen good all of a sudden
"Grayson Allen, Ja Morant and Desmond Bane . Sounds like a team of villains from a superhero movie"
Only thing holding me back from hopping on the Griz bandwagon for this series is Grayson Allen. Kinda annoying he's in the NBA tbh
Grayson Allen is a legitimately good basketball player

Grayson ‚ÄúTed ‚ÄúZodiac Killer‚Äù Cruz‚Äù Allen from downtown!

Having Grayson Allen on their team makes the Grizzlies so much less likeable
Grayson Allen is that one guy at the Y
Is it shocking Grayson Allen would ball out in Utah he‚Äôs in his natural habitat
"Sorry I'm late, Grayson Allen tripped me on my way up the concourse."
If the Grizzlies didn‚Äôt have Grayson Allen they‚Äôd be the most likable team in the NBA
Grayson Allen is amazing.
"Whatchu gonna do when Dillon Brooks, Desmond Bane, and Grayson Allen come after you, brother!!!"
"&gt; The 2018 draft just keeps on looking better and better. It was STACKED! Ayton, trae, luka, SGA, mikal and miles bridges, MPJ, JJJ, Sexton, jalen Brunson, Robert Williams, Gary Trent jr, even donte divencenzo and **Grayson Allen**."
Grayson Allen
Grayson Allen.  He will rain threes...
I'm sad about the Hawks/Grizzlies beef over Grayson Allen because I love the Grizzlies. I love the energy and attitude they play with. Ja is a star.

"Wait Grayson Allen is on Memphis? Shit I forgot. OK, I'm rooting for Utah"
Home game for Grayson Allen lmfao

Grayson Allen‚Ä¶tf u doin bro
Ew Grayson Allen
I feel like Grayson Allen has single handedly changed the momentum of this game.
"Grayson Allen is on the court, time to shut off the game. A true embarrassment to the league!"
"What's the current opinion on Grayson Allen? I mostly know him as having a highly punchable face and tripping people then being indignant about it, has he changed? I mean, aside from his face, which is the same."
"Good news, Grayson Allen is back... said no one ever."
Remember when Grayson Allen dropped 40 for the Jazz? Those were the days
Or Grayson Allen? This sub would implode.
