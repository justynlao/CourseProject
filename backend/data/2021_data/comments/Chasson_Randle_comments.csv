Thats Chasson Randle
"He’s still getting into basketball shape I think, but he has a lot of potential. He’s super smart and is always making the right play and is a good shooter. He needs more confidence and I wanna see him with players that aren’t Chasson Randle and MCW."
"Care to name a handful that we could go grab right now?  A 3rd string caliber PG being forced to start due to injuries who is significantly better?  We've seen what guys a tier below that (Frank Mason, Chasson Randle) look like on an NBA court.  When we signed MCW to back-to-back 10 day contracts to make the playoff push in 2019 to end the drought, he was legitimately a major reason we won a few of those games.  So saying he wasn't ever good off the bench is a bit overboard.  I agree he's not good but it is definitely true that he is playing a far larger role than desired based on the current situation."
Orlando needs a point guard that can make threes.  Really we are playing Chasson Randle.
"Cmon Orlando, gimme some Quinn cook, F Chasson Randle"

Pistons aren’t ready for the PG rotation of MCW/Chasson Randle
Chasson Randle died so Julius Randle could live
"I remember chasson Randle. He got big minutes for us in the 18-19 season, glad to see he's still in the league."
"Depending on if the Chasson Randle signing works for the Magic I think they should try Mudiay out as well. We've already handed out 4 two-way contracts this year. Karim Mane and Jordan Bone to start the year, Bone got cut then we got Frank Mason III, he got hurt and cut now we're on Randle."
"I disagree here -- speaking for the Magic at least, at one point our roster was so depleted that Frank Mason started a game for us lol.  4 G-league players have seen &gt;50 minutes for us, and one of them (Chasson Randle) has started 5 games for us."
Chasson randle is starting for the magic. We’ve actually 5d cheesed this one by having all our point guards broken so not one has started more than 50% of the games.   Mcw- 20  Anthony -17  Fultz- 8  Randle- 5
So is Chasson Randle Iniesta or Xavi
Chasson Randle got fucked by refs down the stretch
Chasson Randle gonna ball out
League Fucked. Chasson Randle time baby 😈

They can have Chasson Randle
"At that point there was no one to give the minutes to over Bacon. Bacon wasn’t getting minutes over anyone important unless the guy you’re responding to was clamoring for more Ignas Brazdeikis or playing Chasson Randle at the 3.   Also, for the brief period after the trade deadline where MCW and Anthony were both healthy there was a pretty clear effort being made to split the PG minutes fairly evenly between them."
"Otto Porter Jr is probably gone, and most of the random injury fill-ins we signed, so Chasson Randle, Ignas Brazdeikis, Donta Hall, Sindarius Thornwell. Strictly speaking, Mo Wagner is in that category, but I think we'll keep him.   I think we also probably will trade one of Gary Harris or Terrence Ross at some point."
"Rodney Hood, Sekou Doumbouya, Chasson Randle, and Aleksej Pokusevski all ranked worse in BPM in more minutes and about a fifth of the league ranked worse than him in RPM (without considering minutes cutoffs etc).   I'm biased because I love the guy but that's not the worst player in the league. He was bad (as a lot of rookies are, even those who go #2 overall) but will definitely improve"
bro at first i thought this was some fucked up dig at Chasson Randle lmao
"I kinda don't want them to trade Ross until the deadline because I think he will have one of the best seasons of his career. It's astonishing how hard he carried our bench when it was so utterly devoid of offensive talent in the last few years.  I feel we haven't had an NBA-level point guard as a backup his entire time in Orlando. Jerian Grant, washed DJ Augustin and Chasson Randle were really not cutting it. Now we will have 2 great young PGs (probably Cole and RJ) and shooters around him, and I really think he's gonna shine.  I think his value right now is 1 FRP, but come trade deadline I wouldn't be suprised if that became 2 firsts or a nice young player."
So they can sign ~~Omer Asik~~Jordan Bell and Chasson Randle~~Solomon Hill~~ to bloated contracts.
"There arent many direct comparisons but enough evidences to already make a case.  First, the Gleague champion has played in that Intercontinental Cup thingy twice. Even though they're subject to roster changes due to Gleague nature, they're still a representation of an average gleague team right? Both times they ended 0-2, Austin Spurs got beaten hard by the South American teams. And there're many European teams better than San Lorenzo or Flamengo.  Then in 2019 Bayern Munich won a G league combined team, it didnt have like gleague all stars (I suppose they were already out of gleague) though. Before season was stopped due to Covid, that Bayern team had the worst record and worst point differential in Euroleague.  Finally I know the cases of several gleaguers in Europe, with pretty varied trajectories. Chasson Randle averaged 21 points before going to Real Madrid as a reinforcement against the injury plague RM was suffering. He was the least serviceable player in the roster and left at the end of the season. He was EuroLeague champion though.  Xavier Munford was a 18-24 point scorer around 2017 and 2018, but when he got signed by Barcelona at the beginning of 2017, he was awful. In Euroleague he only played 5 games and almost averaged twice as many turnovers than points lol. The context is important too, that 2017 team is widely considered the worst Barcelona basket team in the last half a century. I dont know if that's favours Munford or the opposite.  Phil Pressey also scored 18ppp, went to Barcelona, was very bad, fans were desperate whenever he played. He played for Estudiantes a couple of years later. Estudiantes has been the worst team in ACB these past 5-6 years, Pressey was only meh. Average player on the worst team in the league, that doesnt sounds good at all.  But not everything is negative. There are some g league players doing more decently. Darrun Hilliard is just an ok SG for Euroleague, nothing special but at least he can hold its own. Alex Poythress is a decent bigman, Jordan Lloyd is a good scorer for mid-low EL teams.  And one ""?"" was Jordan McRae who was signed by Baskonia one year and got injured after some games, it dragged on and he ended up leaving the team a couple of months later. He averaged 30 in Gleague a year later. We'll never know how he would have turned out."
"Who faults a coach for playing to win games?  It's on the front office to ""tank,"" coaches are trying to play smart and instill good habits in their players, you know, win games. When coaches start throwing games or giving players minutes they don't deserve you instill some very hard-to-break losing habits in guys. See: the Jacque Vaughn era in Orlando.   And who exactly was James Ennis or Chasson Randle playing in front of? We had no healthy guards or wings, let alone younger ones who deserved time so he literally had to play those guys. RJ Hampton went from 12th man in Denver to playing 25 minutes per game. Cole Anthony started 3/4 of the games he was healthy for. Okeke was getting 18 MPG over the first 5 games of the season before he went down with an injury. Clifford has consistently given the better players more minutes. There are certainly some questionable lineup decisions, but none that are terribly egregious.   As for Khem Birch, Khem was ahead of Bamba on the depth chart when we were trying to win, if the front office didn't want Clifford to play him, they could've easily traded him at the deadline. And ultimately, they ended up waiving him like a week later anyway.   &gt;Clifford has preferred playing vets to developing young players his entire head coaching career.   Literally, every NBA coach, at least the successful ones, prefers to put players who help them win on the floor."
"This sounds like it was written by Steve Clifford.       The guy started veterans James Ennis, Dwayne Bacon, Chasson Randle, and Khem Birch after the trade deadline when it was clear the Magic were trying to develop their young guys. It led to a meaningless win over the Pelicans, like many other meaningless late season Magic wins that have hurt their/your lottery odds and led to worse draft picks.      Your best prospect in years was Jonathan Isaac and didn’t even average 10 FGA/game by this third season under Clifford. MCW is atrocious lol. Gordon was so consistently underwhelming I have no idea how you could type that “he looked so good”… the Nuggets gave up a recent 24th pick in Hampton and a protected first rounder five years away, as well as the corpse of Gary Harris.       Clifford has preferred playing vets to developing young players his entire head coaching career. To suggest otherwise is true revisionist history."
Bring him back he is better than Chasson Randle
Chasson Randle and Jason Chandler sounds like Ray Allen and Allan Ray.
"Yeah, a bunch of G-League players. Will Davis II, Justin Anderson, Brian Bowen II, Josh Gray, Shaq Harrison, Haywood Highsmith, BJ Johnson, Luke Kornet, Chasson Randle, Zavier Simpson, Emanuel Terry and Isaiah Thomas."
Non-NBA guys.   Chasson Randle and Luke Kornet highlight everyone else.
