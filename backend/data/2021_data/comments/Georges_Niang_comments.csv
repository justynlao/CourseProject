Georges Niang
If Luka wants out they go full tank.  Utah can give them Georges Niang and a picture of the Joe Ingles meme signed by Juwan Morgan.
"Georges Niang, but that's subsided of late. Early on people wanted more Miye Oni"
don’t forget georges niang
"Since I just posted this to another misguided Pelican-watcher, I'll do it again.   As it happens, here are Williamsons' possessions in the Jan 21st game against Utah.

No idea why he randomly started hating the Jazz of all teams. Just waiting on his Georges Niang slander at this point.
That Georges Niang intimidation at the rim!
We da Rockets now. Georges Niang is the new stretch 5
He's looked fine. Georges Niang acting as a role player with the starters has been great. Trying to be the primary scorer and creator on the garbage squad is asking way too much
"Nah man, There’s plenty of good ones now, people just use numbers and last names more, these are ones off the top of my head  Spida - Donovan Mitchell  Patient Zero, Stifle Tower, French Connection - Rudy Gobert  Minivan - Georges Niang  Juan Stockton/Spanish Samurai - Ricky Rubio  The Greek Freak  Durantula/Slim Reaper  The Brow  The Beard    Those are pretty cool"
"I love Georges Niang, he's so down to earth. Just a fun, happy, humble dude. It hurts when fans trash him when he makes mistakes or doesn't play well. Like I get it but how can you be that mean to a guy like that"
"Yeah that’s why Mike Conley, Georges Niang, etc are all coming out against Shaq right? Just a bunch of nerds who don’t play sports...oh wait"
I gotta say shout out to my Cyclone homie Georges Niang too. Probably not the most well known but he's just another really easy to root for guy.
You doin' Conley dirty here.  And the obvious answer is Georges Niang for the other 4 spots.
Man Niang has Clarkson mentality while having the body of Georges Niang
BANG BANG GEORGES NIANG  (3 fouls now go sit)
Georges Niang
only one i can think of is Georges Niang
"Zions defense is way worse than I thought. Georges Niang of all people, probably the least athletic guy in the NBA, was driving past him like it was nothing"
"Actually I lived in Russia for a while, went to the ballet every other week. Fairly certain the dudes from Swan Lake could stay in front of Georges Niang. . ."
"We have georges ""minivan"" Niang but Ive never once heard Don called Ferrari like the announcers said. Been watching him since he came in the NBA and haven't heard it once"
"No, no it wouldn't be.   We are a top 10 defense because of Rudy. Zion is as bad defensively as he is good offensively. Replace Rudy with Zion and we would legit be contending for worst defense in the league.   Zion got torched off the dribble by Georges Niang multiple times in this game. He is a large part of why they lost."
Zion's finishing was impeccable tonight. His defense however was as bad as anyone in the NBA. I've never seen Georges Niang consistently beat someone off the dribble like he did Zion.
Georges Niang
Georges Niang
Georges Niang-esque
wow max strus looks exactly like georges niang and also both are #31 which is an odd jersey number
We'll give you Georges Niang
"Better,  Are you equally upset with the other players who had “education reform” on their jerseys?  Kyle Lowry, CJ McCollum, Marcus Morris, Solomon Hill,  Kent Bazemore, Demar Derozan, Ed Davis, Georges Niang"

Probably Georges Niang
"DR Congo has Mudiay and Biyombo, and Senegal has probably the worst trio in Gorgui Dieng, Tacko Fall and Georges Niang."
"3 time league MVP, and then they gave him his 4th MVP in the fucking middle of the season because of ""The Dunk Heard Round The World""  Such a fucking legend, that Georges Niang"
"I loved the Georges Niang edit a month ago where he was referred to as ""Fat Curry, slayer of the Golden Taint Warriors"""
"Eh, we got lots of dudes to watch in the NBA (so we don't have to watch the Flyin' Pr0-16hms this year). Monte Morris, Georges Niang, THT, Matt Thomas, Abdel Nader, Haliburton. All having solid years, and all but Tyrese on good-ish teams."
"Clearly, CLEARLY he's forgetting about a certain *someone* on the number 1 team in the NBA right now named Georges Niang 😤"
"literally everything is better for them this year than it was last year  in terms of what changed on paper, healthy bojan, conley has adjusted to the system, favors is our backup centre now instead of tony bradley, and players like royce o'neale and joe ingles are even more willing to to shoot the three than they were before.  you can also point to some smaller improvements like mitchell is a more willing passer (even if his assist numbers aren't noticeably higher), gobert is putting in his best season ever defensively, clarkson has cleaned up his shot selection and is an actual human torch, georges niang is not a negative on defence anymore, snyder's rotations are a lot tighter and more effective as well"
smh the clowns around here who clearly have never seen Georges Niang play
and Georges Niang! Go Clones
He’s a regular Georges Niang!
Give it to Georges Niang after yesterday
Also Georges Niang is number 31. Coincidence? I think not...
I was very aesthetically pleased watching Georges Niang last night 😩
"Georges Niang? 7-7 fg, 7-7 3pt, 21pts"
"I just think with the amount of picks they had, their depth should be better than it is. In the post-big 3 era how many second-rounders did they have? and how many of those worked out? I know that most second rounders don't work out, but to have as many as they did and for them to basically all be bad picks is the reason they have no depth. The last two champions have had players drafted in the second round rounding out their depth: Norman Powell and Kyle Kuzma.  Like quickly scrolling through some drafts right now, in 2015 they took Jordan Mickey above Richaun Holmes and Willy Hernangómez and Marcus Thornton over Norman Powell.  In 2016 they took Demetrius Jackson when they could have taken Georges Niang.  2019: Tremont Waters over Jalen McDaniels.  The only really solid second round picks I came across, where there weren't better players taken right after, were Abdel Nader and Semi Ojeleye."
Georges Niang reminds me of Baloo the bear from the Jungle Book
LMAO Georges Niang is a more successful basketball player than TJ Leaf.
"After reading Jazz fans' comments on game threads from the playoffs about how Georges Niang should be fired from a cannon into the sun I'm just glad to see hes alive.  Also another team sets a franchise record for made 3s against James Borrego's secrit zone defense, lol."
"That's Georges ""Bench Guy"" Niang to you sir."
It’s not really fair to ask questions like this.  Who do they have that can compare to Georges Niang?
"We're averaging the most 3 pointers per game by any team in NBA history and our rotation players, minus the big men, just shoot an insanely efficient clip on high volume. I'll repost this table from another comment, that's accurate as of the completion of tonights game.     |Player|G|3P|3PA|3P%| :--|--:|--:|--:|--:| |Joe Ingles|27|68|147|**46.26%**| |Royce O'Neale|31|53|126|**42.06%**| |Mike Conley|25|70|170|**41.18%**| |Bojan Bogdanović|31|78|200|**39.00%**| |Donovan Mitchell|29|98|252|**38.89%**| |Jordan Clarkson|31|100|263|**38.02%**| |Georges Niang|31|37|101|**36.63%**|"
"We've got shooters everywhere that it's kinda ridiculous that Niang is only the 7th best shooter (by % this year even tho he's at 41.0% and 40.0% the last two seasons) in our rotation, apart from Gobert and Favors.      |Player|G|3P|3PA|3P%| :--|--:|--:|--:|--:| |Joe Ingles|27|68|147|**46.26%**| |Royce O'Neale|31|53|126|**42.06%**| |Mike Conley|25|70|170|**41.18%**| |Bojan Bogdanović|31|78|200|**39.00%**| |Donovan Mitchell|29|98|252|**38.89%**| |Jordan Clarkson|31|100|263|**38.02%**| |Georges Niang|31|37|101|**36.63%**|"
Is Georges Niang the best shooter ever?
"Georges"" Wardell Stephen Curry” Niang"
"Georges"" Wardell Stephen Curry” Niang"
So many contenders for the Jordan Clarkson bench player of the game award  - Jordan Clarkson  - Joe Ingles  - Georges Niang  Love it.
"Georges Niang was so offended as a basketball PURIST that a team could be foolish enough to have six players on the floor at the same, so he decided to go 6-6 from three"
Georges “The Minivan” Niang
"I think this is the game plan Snyder has always had, and he finally had the right team for it. The team is built around Gobert, his main role is to protect the rim. However, Gobert absolutely is not a shooter, so we can only rely on 1-4 for outside shooting. The last couple of years we generated a shit ton of open shots, but we never had the players to consistently drain them - Rubio, Favors (as PF starter), Crowder etc. Now all of the starters on the floor not named Gobert are excellent 3pt sharpshooters. The Jazz run a ton of screens &amp; switches, and their ball movement is incredible. Also the bench. Jordan Clarkson is a madman. Favors had only spent 1 season away from Utah his entire career - which was last season. He already has deep chemistry with this core. He comes off the bench and slides into the backup C role, where Tony Bradley &amp; Ed Davis severely lacked last year - defensively and getting boards. Add Joe Ingles and Georges Niang to the mix, and you’ve got a deep team."
big time shout out georges niang making this list  you thought he was bad but hes actually good
"Bojan Bogdanovic, Joe Ingles, Royce O'Neale, and Georges Niang are all like that for Utah as well.  Mike Conley is pretty close to making it too, lol.  Still totally crazy for someone like Steph, though.  His offensive load is huge for Golden State."
"Exactly what Georges Niang said he was working on on Duncan Robinson's podcast. Standing in the corner and hitting threes and not being a terrible defender earned himself an NBA roster spot. Expanding his game by learning to drive will get him more minutes. He reemphasized Caruso on that be good on what the team needs. If the team needs a janitor, be the best janitor, don't try and be the CEO."
"...Is this not what most players do though? Either pass out, drive, or side step and shoot. Heck even Georges Niang can do that"
Your forget Georges Niang.  I know he is not super well known but he is incredibly solid and capable of making his own plays.  I'd bump that number up to 9.  What is so nice is that original 8 you mentioned could all be legit starters on most teams.  So when somebody new comes in the style of play has to change very little.  It essentially amounts to a quasi starting lineup on the floor the entire game.  It destroys other teams 2nd units.
you think that guy is seriously advocating for dallas to trade luka and porzingis and receive GEORGES NIANG and mike conley and calling it a trade that benefits all parties?  not to mention suns giving up booker. it’s a joke trade because the guy wants book and luka.
"""Out jumping Niang"" as if Georges can jump"
"Especially with all the specialization. I was listening to Georges Niang on Duncan Robinsons podcast about what he was told to leave an impression with scouts and make a roster, and it was that “you only need to bring one, two suits to make it to the Ball”. Don’t try to bring 12.  Previous players needed to be good well rounded basketball players at all facets of the game and there just aren’t that many well rounded not-elite players.  Now you can be super elite in one or two areas and have major impact"
"Georges Niang hasn't even been that bad this year compared to last year, but I still wish we had a better 9th guy off the bench"
"Yeah Ive been saying for a while now they got lucky with what's frankly a donation from Minnesota with that pick this year in that hideous D'Lo trade for them. Because otherwise this has not been the most well run franchise from a roster building/talent management perspective for a while.   Danuel House, Chris Boucher, Kendrick Nunn, Georges Niang all once on the roster and got waived.   Havent made good use of things like the MLE in the past. Nick Young was useless in 2018. Omri Casspi did dick and pissed everybody off in the process. You can do this with every team I get it...but when the roster is flawed then you cant not look at it.   2019: Select Jordan Poole. The following 3 picks were Keldon Johnson, KPJ and Nic Claxton. 2018: Jalen Brunson, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent all within 10 picks. 2016: Damian Jones at 30: Following guys went within 10 picks: Ivica Zubac, Malcolm Brogdon  Dont want to relitigate the LaMelo thing, but if the ""fit"" concerns truly played a meaningful role in passing up on him that's not a justifiable process. Only pick I think theyve gotten any kind of value on of the past 5 yrs is Paschall  Last night just felt like Lou Will basically made every key play in the 4th quarter at particular key times. 3 point lead [hits Okongwu on the roll](https://go.nba.com/w5xg). Next play [pull up](https://go.nba.com/i7xn). Next play [baits JTS 3 shots](https://go.nba.com/rpuu). Gallo then the next few minutes decides to smartly do all his foul baiting and drawing before Steph is set to step back in on the next whistle. Then it's back to Lou [pass to Bogdan for 3](https://go.nba.com/nzqb). That entire early 4th quarter stretch felt like swung the game [this one in particular was a killer right before Steph is set to get back in](https://go.nba.com/uu34) you could feel it at the time. Breakdown defensively, Draymond doesnt want to leave the paint because of the Capela roll threat, think he wanted Wiggins to ""X-out"" where Draymond then wouldve taken Snell. [2 more for good count](https://go.nba.com/vxkb) from Lou [this I think was the other play that swung the game](https://go.nba.com/37ok)."
"Stockton is famous for DRIVING a minivan, Georges Niang is famous for BEING a minivan"
Pretty sure he broke his leg early on in that season too and by the time he was healthy Georges Niang had taken over his minutes and did a lot more with them than Davis had been.
"Georges Niang last year was absolutely awful. Not only did he not shoot well in close games but because we had to play him, his defense was horrendous. So much so that we would lose leads whenever Gobert went to the bench.  This year, it is night-and-day different. Even if he doesn't score now, he hasn't played himself off the floor this year."
Maaaaybe Georges Niang.
"1. Rudy 2. Mitchell 3. Conley 4. Clarkson 5. Bojan Bogdanovich 6. Joe Ingles 7. Royce O'Neale 8. **Derrick Favors** 9. **Georges ""Minivan"" Niang**"

The GOAT Georges Niang has a 98.9 defensive rating so I’m not impressed.

How much help does Georges Niang need?

This is just not true.   [Some metrics show it was the worst of his career](https://hoopshype.com/lists/nba-most-improved-defenders-andrew-wiggins-miles-bridges-georges-niang-pj-dozier/)
You’re not going to have Klay in the playoffs whereas we will have Mitchell and Conley. We started Georges Niang lmao.
Where's Georges Niang yo?

I think you mean Georges Niang 😤
"If you don't now the name Georges Niang... You don't know NBA basketball, ya' filthy casual."
"1. conley, SS - good defender, will get on base, has never struck out in his entire career. great table setter  2. mitchell, CF - good speed and range, can hit for power as well  3. gobert, C - Big man with a huge bat, insane range defensively  4. bojan bogdanovic, DH - swings for the fences every time  5. joe ingles, LF - if bojan didnt bat them in joey vegemite will  6. jordan clarkson, RF - also swings for the fences every time  7. Georges Niang, 1B - hes in the league for his hitting, but also surprisingly decent defender for his position   8. royce oneale, 2B - good individual defender, not a huge offensive threat but he can make plays  9. derrick favors, 3b - quietly does the dirty work like a professional"
Georges Niang and it's not close
Georges Niang is my favorite Star Wars character!
Harry Giles III and Georges Niang. You get Giles' defense and and Niang's 3pt shooting.
Don't forget Georges Niang and Ersan Ilyasova who both lead the league in 3 pointers per game when starting this season (6.0)
Georges Niang scored 6 threes in his first start of the year last week. He'd have to wrestle the ball from Clarkson to get there though.
Why do you talk about the best defender ever but then bring up Rudy Gobert and not Georges Niang
"""we literally did pick him [georges] up off the street""  ironic, considering niang was the only one of the 3 in the breakfast club to actually be drafted in the NBA. Joe and Royce were signed off the street."
"It used to be Joe Ingles, then it became Royce O'Neale, then it became Georges ""George"" Niang, and now it's probably Miye Oni. He's going to be really good next season."
"You put Cade in the best position to succeed. Make Garland and Sexton both available and trade the one you get the best offer for. See if there's a way you can get a young big (go hard after John Collins) and depth that has played in a structured system (try to get guys like Georges Niang, Jarrell Brantley, Furkan Korkmaz, Monte Morris, Semi Ojeleye). Prey on teams that might be looking to shed salary around the margins to go after FAs or cut their luxury tax bills.   In short, go all-in on Cade and surround him with players that aren't going to be the problem. Also, you need a new coach, someone like Charles Lee. Hire him."
Georges Niang is my favorite character in Star Wars.
**EVERYONE IS ON FIRE**           Then there’s Georges Niang
"Forget Dirk’s 2011 chip…if we win the championship while giving Georges Niang minutes in the playoffs, I’m considering it the greatest playoff run in league history."
"Mitchell, Bogey, and Gobert are sitting and these lineups with Ingles and Clarkson usually also have Mike Conley on the floor but since they don't we're playing Miye Oni who theoretically is a good shooter but doesn't space the floor and is not reliable from 3pt range at this point in his career, and Georges Niang who is an actual good 3pt shooter but has just been atrocious this series."
I've come to realize that Georges Niang is just slow Nic Batum that can't pass and I don't like that.
"When Georges Niang is in, I get a little chubby dude."
This guy lost his job to Georges Niang last season with the Jazz.  Kind of crazy how flat that signing fell with how well he's done everywhere since.
Harden looking like Georges Niang right now
"I think Ty has done a great job at identifying a working formula, but I don't have an issue with Snyder's coaching. Sometimes, the other team just has Kawhi and PG and a good supporting cast and you have to tip your cap to them.     I think Snyder is in a bind and he knows that with athletes of the caliber of Joe Ingles and Georges Niang there are only so many ways you can play against the Clippers' wings. It's frustrating, as a Jazz fan, but hopefully we get Mike back and kind of discombobulate them a bit with the home crowd."
Georges Niang is 1-11 in the series so far.
Meanwhile Georges Niang made only 1 FG in this series so far.
"If you ever feel bad about not contributing at work as much as you should, remember that Georges Niang is making 1.7 million dollars this year.  (jk Georges, &lt;3 u... but maybe you should find a way to play with the slightest bit of confidence if you go on the floor during the playoffs)"
Has Georges Niang made a shot in the playoffs?
Georges Niang looks like everyone’s MyCareer player when they’re a 61 overall
"That’s another factor in analytics, at least the ones us normal schlubs can find on BBallReference: they play into the law of averages. That’s a smart thing to do from a team-building perspective, because it shows a player is ultimately a net value in the long run. But for guys like Wright, Jae Crowder, Georges Niang, and Maxi Kleber, you need a coach who can pull the plug or adjust when they’re performing below the average, because they can shoot you out of the game when they play poorly. In the current West where two or three wins can help you miss or make the playoffs (especially now, with the play-in), you can’t set rigid lineups because the numbers say so. Almost no analytics adherent is doing that, but this article makes it seems like the Mavs guy was, considering how the players argued Carlisle’s rotations were too rigid."
Georges Niang
Of course not but do you think the Clippers are 24 points better than the Jazz every night without Conley?    Georges Niang crapped his pants at the beginning of the 4th giving away 4 possessions in about 4 minutes of playing time. Not that I thought Utah had enough to come back but when he threw the ball away three times and jacked a three that hit backboard first all hope was lost.    I'm not sure Conley will be back for the next game anyway.  Without him I don't think they stand much of a chance in LA.
"Oh damn, I saw Georges and Niang and assumed."
Some dude named Georges Niang is out there shitting on himself getting minutes in a playoff game and people think this league can support two more teams?
Georges Niang
(Woj) Georges Niang has been released by the Utah Jazz
Georges Niang is like our 9th or 10th best player though...
Holy shit Georges Niang has been garbage in the playoffs
\*2 Months from now\*  Lakers have signed Georges Niang to a 4 year 90 Million dollar contract.
Rudy isn't like any other 7 footer. He's the best defender in basketball. You think Jordan Clarkson or Georges Niang could do a better job in that situation? The Jazz have won games trusting Gobert to defend in those scenarios before.
"Never forget, Georges Niang and a top 10 ranked Iowa State team lost to a wildly unimpressive and unranked South Carolina team in a neutral game in Brooklyn.   Go Cocks"
Bang bang Georges Niang!
I'd love a Joe Ingles and Georges Niang commentary duo for the Jazz
"While I don’t think Thibs is undeserving, many players in Snyder’s system would not operate as well without him. Royce O’Neale, Georges Niang, Joe Ingles and others thrive in this system but I believe would have minimal success elsewhere. I could see them drop substantially with a league average coach"
"Monte Morris, Georges Niang, Matt Thomas, Abdel Nader, Talen Horten Tucker and Tyrese Haliburton."
First team all defense Georges Niang!
Yeah man why would they ever give people like Georges Niang minutes? /s
Finals MVP Georges Niang.
Georges Niang
It is really amazing that Georges Niang gets minutes
if you're too slow to get a shot off before Georges Niang closes you down from 10 feet away  you might be Kyle Anderson
Georges Niang sounds like a Star Wars character
"I don't know if other teams do this, but it seems to have become a thing on the Jazz squad to wear funny apparel of the other teammates. Georges Niang does it all the time. A lot of the bench guys do. Ekpe Udoh had a lot of good merch that the guys were repping."
Georges niang talks way too much for a dude built like a vat
Does not compute Georges Niang is still playing.
Georges Niang yessir
"Oh cmon, there's nothing more exciting than Georges Niang!"
"And in typical fashion, our Georges Niang death lineup will save us."
"Ingles also lost a lot from an efficiency standpoint when when Mitchell and Conley both went down and he was forced into service as the de facto first unit point guard.   If you take a look at what happened during the past month or so with no Conley or Mitchell you can actually see that Georges Niang, stepping into a similar role to that previously occupied by Ingles when both Conley and Mitchell were playing, was also capable of producing highly efficient scoring on neutral usage."
Georges MiniVan Niang. Jazz rode his sexy butt all aboard to number 1 seed.
"Ya, they really built a team of killer three point shooting role players, and it took years.  Georges Niang (the Jazz like 8th or 9th man) was on Duncan Robinson’s podcast a while back. In college he was a back-to-the-basket bruiser. Everyone knew he couldn’t do that in the nba. He got cut a couple times and ended up in Utah. He said an assistant coach told him “you may think you know what you’re here to do, but you don’t. We need you to come off the bench and hit one or two corner threes a night. That’s it. It you can do that, you’ll have a contract. Don’t do that, and you’ll get waived.”   He hits the corner threes, but he’s really grown his game and is a pretty damn good bench piece, hitting ~40% from three, both corner and above the break."
Imagine if Quin Snyder realized Georges Niang wasn’t working against the Clippers. Smh.
"This is a pretty good move by the Celtics, but it sucks to see him leave.  For those who don't know, Aaron Miles was the HC of the Santa Cruz Warriors from 2017-2019 and Player Development Coach from 2019-21. His Santa Cruz team consisted of Chris Boucher, Kendrick Nunn, Georges Niang, Damion Lee, and Juan Toscano-Anderson. This season, he was mainly credited with the improvement of Juan Toscano-Anderson and Andrew Wiggins"
"&gt;Along with Oubre, only Tim Hardaway Jr., Otto Porter Jr., Evan Fournier and Georges Niang check the same boxes          Please continue snoozing on Powell - all tree y'all ♥♥♥"
You forgot Georges Niang but other than that good list
Georges Niang winning 4 MVPs in a row - with his 4th coinciding with a cancellation of the remainder of the season because he was too dominant (Niang's *Dunk Heard Round The World* shut it down) - was pretty shocking as well.
Swaps for a slightly used Georges Niang?
"Barely anyone has said this. We all know what his issues were and we stand by them. Of course we're going to wish him the best, he's a nice dude.  The only people who are saying they never criticised him are people who barely go on the sub, and thrive off of negativity. We have like the most negative sub, every game thread had typical people who would complain and blame for no reason.  If you actually pay attention and go on our sub, you'll see that the main belief is that it was time to part ways.  Y'all motherfuckers don't watch us play.  Dude never utilised our shooters. We were 30th in 3-point attempts and I think 30th in FTA. He spammed PnR, even when Brogdon was driving into Bam. He liked ISO hero ball, with Oladipo handling the ball for 20 seconds before taking a long 2. He made no adjustments and let runs go on too far. We collapsed every 3rd quarter. He lost the locker room. He had no inbound plays, Brogdon even complimented Bjorkgren on drawing up plays. We never played our young guys, just look at Alize Johnson, Georges Niang, or Edmond Sumner.  His system works for Trae Young and Clint Capela, but it didn't work for us. You build a system around your players, not the other way around."
Joe Harris is the eastern conference Georges Niang
- Donovans injury has been getting worse and worse each game. Even if he plays he will be limited.  - No Conley  - Favors is not Rudy Gobert  - Georges Niang is in the rotation
Georges Niang gonna have to step up obviously
"I think these failures are an indictment on the Jazz team construction. During the Snyder era, our team structure is such that we can only play one system proficiently. Our guards are pick and roll playmakers, our wings shoot threes, and our bigs are screen setters and lob threats. It's a beautiful system when the pieces are healthy and playing well. However, our bench depth doesn't add any new wrinkles to this system (other than Clarkson's isolation game), so it's easy to scout the Jazz. Compare this to teams like Phoenix and LAC who have more diversity in their personnel. A guy like Georges Niang is nice to have when you need a spot up shooter for your system, but when you need an isolation wing scorer, the last thing you need are three Niangs on your roster."
He’s literally a taller Georges Niang. He’ll be around for a while.
"Georges Niang vs Gorgui Dieng, FIGHT!"
Difference is Im not such a hater that I go out of my way to find random ‘highlights’ of Georges Niang just to shit on a guy and then act like thats not what Im doing
Since last year PatBev has made more than you and Georges Niang have in your combined lives😃👍
Until today I had no idea it was possible to trigger someone by posting a Georges Niang highlight
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."

Rudy Gay is a huge upgrade over Georges Niang.

Pacers Legend Georges Niang
I’ll miss Bang! Bang! Georges Niang :/
"Next time you're updating the list, add Georges Niang"
"Good question! I'm not a cap wizard. I think at 32 it's probably still fine to be drafted, but by the 40s you're better off not getting drafted IF you can prove yourself.  UDFAs have little leverage. Technically they can sign any contract they want, but most of the time they sign a three-year contract with the third year not guaranteed. Success stories in UDFA are few, but if you bet on yourself and it works out, you can enter RFA earlier and earn bigger money quicker.   Fred Van Vleet signed a 2-year 1.4 million contract with the Raptors under the old CBA in 2016 after going undrafted (partly through choice). Then he entered RFA in the 18-19 offseason and had already signed, by then, a 2/18 contract.   Compare that to the 32nd pick in 2016, Ivica Zubac - he signed a 3/3.2 contract with the Lakers and didn't start earning real money until 2019-20, when the Clippers extended him for 3/21. So comparatively, FVV got to start earning real money sooner.   An even better example is Wes Matthews in 2010, who signed a 1/457K contract with the Jazz, and played well enough to get a 5/35 offer sheet from Portland as an RFA the following offseason which the Jazz matched.   When you get down to, like, the 50th pick, it gets dicey. Georges Niang signed a 3/2.5 contract with the Pacers and got waived before his second year started, and he only earned 750K from that first contract total, with the second year guaranteed only 100K. If Niang believed in himself and could sell himself well enough (and if he was, uh, better), he could have signed a 2-year guaranteed deal with another club like Freddy."
"Nic Batum, Wes Matthews, Danny Green, Rudy Gay, Wayne Ellington, JJ Reddick, Trevor Ariza, Carmelo Anthony, Kelly Olynik, Reggie Bullock, Jeff Green, Kent Bazemore, Georges Niang  Not saying all or even any are gettable for the Lakers, but... there are a lot of free agents out there who can shoot respectably."
"I understand it's value is pretty small But you can package it with other things to get actual assets.   And you can find contributors in that range. Shake Milton, Monte Morris, Georges Niang, Jalen McDaniels are all recent picks in the 50s who have found big roles in the NBA quite quickly."
"He's had one year of good production and he shot significantly better on shots at the college 3pt line (48% on 3s inside of 24 ft) than on NBA 3s (34% beyond 24 ft). He's also not just old, he'd the be the oldest first round pick ever--he's roughly 6 years older than Jaden Springer or Josh Primo.   The question isn't if he's a good player (he is!), it's whether trading up for him is an efficient allocation of resources. Would you rather draft Ennis or have a young guard (Bones/Sharife/Tre Mann/Buter/McBride etc), another prospect (Garuba/Ziaire/JT Thor) and sign some cheap wing (Georges Niang/Torrey Craig/Sterling Brown/Langston Galloway/James Ennis)?   All those free agents will be super gettable and cheap (just like Bullock and Burks were) and they'll provide the exact same shit that Duarte would, without nearly the same level of investment"
"50 players shot 90% or better but didn't shoot enough to qualify for leaderboard  Trent Forrest for example shot 19/19  Langston Gallaway shot 22/23 as did Georges Niang  https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_totals.html  uncheck the ""hide non-qualifier"" box"
"How so?  Any 52nd pick or undrafted player who is even a viable bench player is a steal.    The best 50+ pick from 2010-2018 were Jeremy Evans, Isaiah Thomas, Robert Sacre, Ennis, Jordan Mcrae, Brandon Dawson (because he was literally the only one to play an NBA minute), Georges Niang, Monte Morris, and Shake Milton.  Isaiah was obviously an insane outlier.  The rest of the guys are either below average role players or not in the league."
"Honestly this is probably the most success Iowa State players have had in the league ever. Monte Morris- one of the best 6th men in the league Tyrese Haliburton- ROY candidate this year, seems to be a key piece for the Kings moving forward  Georges Niang, Abdel Nader, Talen Horton-Tucker- All solid rotation players for playoff teams Plus you have guys like Matt Thomas, Naz Long, Deonte Burton, and Marial Shayok who have all had appearances on rosters for playoff teams.  Ironically, Royce White was one of the highest draft picks and he flamed out, although that obviously wasn't for on-court reasons."
Jordan Farmar  Shannon Brown  Oscar Schmidt  Dino Radja  Arvydas Sabonis  Or...  Monte Morris  Tyrese Haliburton  Matt Thomas  Abdel Nader  Georges Niang
Joe Ingles and/or Georges (pronounced George) Niang in Utah.  Funny mutha fuckazz!
"Awesome, then we trade for and max Georges Niang to complete the Iowa State Kings roster"
"There are around 200k people in SLC, with 2.6% black population, so there are approximately 5200 black people. Assume half men, so 2600 black men.   33.4% of the city’s population is 25 to 44, now we have 1736 people. I’m going to cut this group in half, as Clarkson is 29 and could pass as any age from 25 to 35, so we are now at 868.   Clarkson being 6’4” puts him in the upper 0.8% of height for the population ages 25-34, knocking this group down to 7 people.   Looking at the Jazz roster from last year, the following players fit the profile of black, 25-35, and 6’4” and above  -	Jarrell Brantley -	Jordan Clarkson -	Derrick Favors -	Rudy Gobert -	Shaq Harrison -	Georges Niang -	Miye Oni  Summary: if you see a very tall black man who looks like he can legally rent a car, there is a 100% chance he plays for the Jazz."
casual take and you're 100% wrong lmao. you think the jazz has been a top defensive team lately because of bojan bogdanovic/jordan clarkson/georges niang/arguable their second best defender royce  o'neale(who struggles against quicker smaller guards)?  tell me you don't watch basketball without telling me you don't watch basketball
Georges Niang  Kendrick Perkins
The wolves can also offer prince tho. Tobias Harris and Georges Niang are basically the only sixers players with size on the perimeter. The sixers struggled last year with not having size off the bench. Capable wings like prince with size and shooting are not that easy to get in the current trade market.
"I get FTJ but how do you have mavs and nugs over the Jazz? Nugs won't have Murray for arguably 75% of the season, Mavs didn't really get much better in the off season, and the Jazz are running it back as the former #1 seed replacing Georges Niang for Rudy Gay"
"&gt; The contract is a null point, it’ll be up before Mobley’s extension would theoretically kick in. That also lines up to when Garland and Sexton theoretically will start reaching their potential and we will actually be trying to compete and sign legit FAs to go deep in the playoffs.  Ok so technically if the cavs give hefty contracts to garland, sexton, and no one else, they will have a lot of capspace in summer 2024 right before mobley signs his theoretical max extension. In this case the cavs can waive lauri and pay him 6m to fuck off if he doesn’t work out. The problem here is that this is a very oversimplified scenario. The cavs can always use cap space to sign better young players, or take on bad contracts for draft picks. In reality cap space always matters.  &gt; We can definitely use the floor-spacing.  The sixers signed georges niang for a bit over the min, something like 3m. He’s probably in the same neighborhood as markannen defensively, and he just shot in the same neighborhood as Mccollum and Buddy Hield in terms of 3PT volume and 3PT percentage on a per minute basis (8-10 3PA per 36 @ ~40%). It’s not like stretch 4s are these rare beasts.  &gt; Because they’re going for the ceiling play— Lauri is younger, and could end up being much better than he’s currently projected.  As I said, I believe the cavs should have been able to get a solid draft pick out of nance if they played their hand right. Why would you want to pay 67m for a guy who hasn’t particularly shown it in 4 years when you could take a risk on a good draft pick for way less money."
Knicks killer Georges Niang
Georges Niang trying to impress that girl from Twitter  if you know you know
"You know, you can disagree without being disagreeable.  Doing what I suggested would be a gamble, but there's still a chance.  Better than having Ben on your team this year and wasting another year of Embiid.  If that makes you mad enough to insult me for daring to suggest that some chances are worth taking, then you can go talk to a wall that agrees with you 100% of the time.  I've no patience to talk to people who feel its ok to attack someone for a disagreement.  Your team's in a terrible position right now.  You could have some hope with Embiid and Harden, but you think its better to gamble on Portland basically giving you Lillard.  They'll never do that.  Your FO didn't want to give up a rookie in Maxey for James fucking Harden.  Embiid and Harden alone is a better starting point to build a team than the entire Sixers rosters right now.  But I'm sure *checks notes* Georges Niang will develop into a reliable 3rd star."
"Lol when KAT inevitably requests trade, we'll offer Danny Green, Tyrese Maxey, Georges Niang, and 2 1sts a.k.a. Beasley, McDaniels, Prince and 2 1sts. Maybe even less considering he has 1 less All-Star appearance than Simmons and has not shown an ability to contribute to winning basketball."
"Wow, not many guys that can score on Furkan Korkmaz and Georges Niang."

Pacers draft well? Let's take a look....  2020 - Cassius Stanley  2019 - Goga Bitadze  2018 - Aaron Holiday and Alize Johnson  2017 - TJ Leaf and Ike Anigbogu  2016 - Georges Niang  2015 - Myles Turner and Joe Young  2014 - Nobody  2013 - Solomon Hill  2012 - Miles Plumlee  2011 - Nobody  10 years worth of draft picks and Myles Turner is the only one who has made any significant noise for the Pacers.
"&gt; Rivers shared how he planned to use Simmons this upcoming season anyway: Embiid and Simmons would stagger minutes more often, and when Embiid came off the floor, Simmons would play the 5, sharing the frontcourt with Tobias Harris and new addition Georges Niang.  Does anyone at this point really think the 76ers have a long term game plan with Simmons on the roster? No way is he still on the team after the trade deadline."
2016: Henry Ellenson becomes Malik Beasley; Michael Gbinijie becomes  Georges Niang  2017: Luke Kennard becomes Donovan Mitchell  2018:  Bruce Brown becomes Justin Jackson; Khyri Thomas becomes Isaac Bonga  2019: Sekou Doumbouya becomes Chuma Okeke; Deividas Sirvydis becomes Daniel Gafford  2020: Killian Hayes becomes Obi Toppin; Isaiah Stewart becomes Aleksej Pokusevski; Saddiq Bey becomes Precious Achiuwa; Saben Lee  becomes Elijah Hughes.  \---  We won as soon as we got Donovan Mitchell.
Georges Niang
"""Our hot start was honestly 80% our bench massively overachieving.""  Yea... the Bulls felt the wrath of Steph Turkey and Georges ""Mikan"" Niang"
"yeah but most of that was without Embiid and Harris, i don't think people were out here expecting Georges Niang to be the MVP"
So you want Georges Niang to be on the floor instead?
saw a dude rocking an INDIANA PACERS Georges Niang jersey in greensboro
"Do former players on the team count? If so, Georges Niang for sure.  If I were to wager on someone currently on the team that fans might start turning on in the future, I would guess Bogdanovich. He loses the ball a lot on post up plays and is super streaky but his highs still outweigh his lows so he’s still liked now."
Watching georges niang play is pretty baffling to me. He was terrible in the playoffs for the jazz and every time I watch him he screws something up. He’s also out of shape looking and thick
Georges Niang. And I think Luka “Tall Georges Niang” Garza will succeed as well.
No serious team is giving minutes to georges niang
"they don't even play the same position, tobi plays the 4 barnes plays the 3  you start georges niang at the 3.  danny green also plays the 3 when healthy  barnes is just a really good two way player who can ball handle and create his own shot if needed.  he would play great alongside literally anyone on your roster.   it would give you a lot of lineup flexibility having more wings"
"barnes is having the best season of his career, he's in his prime right now  he also gives you a veteran championship winning presence.  he was a big player on that 73-9 win warriors team.   he got a lot of minutes that season he was a big reason why they won so many games.   but he was young at the time, he's only now reaching his peak  having too many good wings is never a problem, they already have depth issues at that position with danny green missing time due to injuries  talk about fit all you want if they got harrison barnes he would be a productive player for them immediately and when they get healthier as a team he would make them even better than they were when they went 9-2.   he's definitely better than georges niang  I mean I don't want them to get barnes because it's better for me if the sixers arent that good, but he's by far the best piece they could get from the kings in order to improve their team"
georges niang owns the city of chicago
"definitely did not have ""Georges Niang breakout year"" on my bingo card for this season"
"&gt;&gt; Beyond Embiid, the Sixers’ combination of All-Star caliber players (Tobias Harris) and high-level role players (Seth Curry, Tyrese Maxey, Georges Niang, Matisse Thybulle, Furkan Korkmaz, Danny Green et al.) means there’s no need to take on more players of that ilk.   Cue armchair experts moaning about how Sixers should trade him for a bunch of role players."
"Meanwhile the Pacers (before this year) have drafted:  Cassius Stanley (cut after 1 year)  Goga Bitadze (a Center, when we already are starting 2 Centers, barely plays)  Aaron Holiday (traded him after 3 mediocre years for a pick upgrade to get Isaiah Jackson)  Alize Johnson (barely played, cut after 2 years, now at Houston)  TJ Leaf (absolute trash)  Ike Anigbogu (barely played, cut after 2 years)  Georges Niang (barely played, cut after 2 years, now at Philly)  Caris LeVert (pretty good pick, but we traded him)  Myles Turner (hey, we got one right)  Joe Young (barely played, cut after 3 years)  Solomon Hill (left after 3 years, was ok)  Miles Plumlee (played 14 games here)  Kawhi Leonard (awesome pick, so obviously we traded him draft night)  Davis Bertans (another good pick we traded draft night)"
Georges Niang is basically Royce White's regen except he loves airplane rides and always volunteers to sit in emergency rows
Georges Niang sparks joy
A team that plays Georges Niang in the clutch is an unserious team.
Dame can easily ask for a trade to Philly but nooo smh he’s passing up the opportunity to play alongside Georges Niang 😒
Shoutout to Georges Niang and Furkan Korkmaz for saving my fantasy week.   I had Tobias Harris and Embiid on my team and managed to pick up Niang and Furkan Korkmaz as soon as Tobias went out. I would have lost 0-9 without them.
"Happy for Grayson, but kinda wishing the Jazz had found a way to keep him! Same for Georges Niang."
"A has Georges Niang so that’s pretty obvious, these other teams don’t stand a chance against the MiniVan 🚐"
Georges Niang is the French Tatum
Georges Niang is fuckin from Philly. We changed his birth certificate and he’s from down north now.
Georges Niang szn
"Solo? He has Georges ""Minivan"" Niang, league is fucked"
I used to think Georges Niang was just an Afro-French big man.
Iowa State legend Georges Niang. Get it right.
the Georges Niang effect
oh yeah perennial allstar georges niang would take all of KP’s minutes 🤡
"Obviously, a lot of these players will come back down to earth. It's just interesting to see how hot they have started the season. Still, I wouldn't mind seeing Georges Niang remaining a top offensive player in the league for the season."
"Worse, he thinking he's on that Georges Niang shit"
"the vibes are super good right now, but we need more star power if we want to really be contenders.  Our role players have been awesome role players but we're not doing much if it relies on Georges Niang carrying our offense for big chunks of playoff games.  ...unless I'm wrong, Morey Magic is even better than we could have imagined in team building, and we're the reincarnation of the Dwight Magic."
Don’t listen to this idiot. Way too many Jazz fans were unrealistic in their expectations with Georges. He was like 8-9th guy in our rotation and if you’re counting on that guy to be your difference maker you’re gonna have a bad time.  But if you’re counting on a guy like Joel or Tobias then Niang is the perfect complimentary piece that can give you a nice boost if one of those guys has an off night and save you a win.
Georges Niang
"gotta say, I didn’t expect Georges Niang to steal the hearts of sixers fans within a few weeks of playing here lol"
Where were you when Georges Niang became the fan-favorite of a large market team?
"&gt; Georges Niang  Amazing value, no doubt"

"Not a ton of disagreement there, although something like VORP at least gives results one would expect most of the time, while 538s metrics tend to be kinda unpredictable which makes them at least feel wrong if you watch games. Like no way Jokic is the 7th best defender in the league, and that iggy is number 1 rn or that Georges Niang Offensise is currently more valuable than KDs. With most advanced metrics there are situations where it doesn't work but it feels like it happens a lot more with 538s metrics."
Pretty good honesty. Tyrese Maxey and Andre Drummond have both been very good. Georges Niang has suddenly been god. A little worried about Embiid’s health and the sixers letting him play through injury tho
How you let Georges Niang beat you
Blazers fans if you ask really nicely maybe we'll let you have Georges Niang for Dame straight up
For GEORGES MOTHER FUCKING NIANG
