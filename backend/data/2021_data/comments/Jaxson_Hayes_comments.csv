"On today's Lowe Post we have the resident Claxton expert Kevin Arnovitz and in the second part of today's debate, long term Jaxson Hayes fan Howard Beck joins us with an unexpected take on the nation's big issue."
"Finally, the Nick Claxton vs. Jaxson Hayes debate we have all been clamoring for."
"Jaxson ""Wacky Waving Inflatable Tube Guy"" Hayes just doing his thing"
Jaxson Hayes is tall for nothing
"oh my god Jaxson Hayes. I don't ever wanna hear his name and the word ""trade"" together."
I truly think Claxton is better than Jaxson Hayes
Yall should try to trade for Jaxson Hayes... idk with what assets though. U got none
"Yeah literally the exact reason we took Jaxson Hayes at #8 and uhhh that's been interesting so far...,"
The draft is always a crapshoot. At least we got NAW who seems like he has huge upside. Even Jaxson Hayes isn‚Äôt performing particularly bad.
"Eric Bledsoe, Kira Lewis, and your choice of Josh Hart, Nicolo Melli, NAW, or Jaxson Hayes all make the money work. Not to mention an ass load of picks/swaps"
"If you are going to use nothing as the standard for letting him walk you also have to use the other end in what they could have traded him for had they moved him earlier, which is probably not much more, but still. They did lose a little bit of value dragging it out and sitting him in 4ths, making it painfully obvious what had happened to the rest of the world.  They had Zion (1st overall pick) before the trade so he isn't part of the equation at all.  I would hesitate to call it a win-win until the Pels can actually win some games.  Sure BI is nice but Zo will lilkely be dealt or walk, he didn't really bring them much, Hart is a bench player on a basement team, Jaxson Hayes who they got in the draft after another deal w/ Atl isn't exactly killing it either.     Still way to early to call it a loss but they sure as hell ain't winning it when we sit here 18 months later and they are in the basement and the Lakers are sitting on top of the league with a chip in their back pockets already since the deal went down."
Because they're last in 3P%. Which is probably due to the fact that they have \*checks notes\* Zion AND Steven Adams on the floor together. And then their second unit consists of \*check notes again\* Zion and Jaxson Hayes sharing the same floor together.
Jaxson Hayes has the worst hands
"Lonzo, Bledsoe, Jaxson Hayes, this year's Pelicans pick (Top 3 Protected, turns into unprotected first next year), 2023 Pelicans unprotected, 2023 Lakers swap. How about that?"
"Jaxson ""the NBA can suck my dick"" Hayes"
Yes because the Pelicans also got the #1st pick to pull the trigger on a rebuild. And we traded them the 4th pick. Not our fault Jaxson Hayes is trash.
Fuck the NBA -Jaxson Hayes was Snubbed from the rising stars game!! Everyone is talking about it!
Yeah Jaxson Hayes aint it
"LEBRON JAMES' ARRIVAL in July 2018 upended Ingram's role, as it did for every Laker. Ingram would play more off the ball. The Davis trade rumors overwhelmed the team starting in December. Ingram knew he would be part of any Davis deal. Even so, he averaged 18 points before the discovery of a blood clot in his right arm ended his season in March 2019.  ""The [trade rumors] were tough on him,"" said Josh Hart, Ingram's teammate in both L.A. and New Orleans. ""Before LeBron got there, he had been given the keys. And then people in L.A. were killing him: He's not as good anymore. He's not a great No 2. pick. The rumors became part of our lives, all year. Thank god I don't have to deal with that s--- anymore.""  Ingram and Stackhouse discussed how Ingram might fit in New Orleans months before the trade. When it happened, Stackhouse predicted Ingram would excel. ""You're in a place that fits you -- more similar to where you grew up,"" Stackhouse said. ""He was collateral damage, but in a good way. I was ecstatic.""  Ingram's father feels no resentment toward the Lakers, or regret about his son's path.  ""If we went back to draft day, I wouldn't have it any other way,"" Donald Ingram said. ""The L.A. experience helped him become a man.""  On Ingram's first day in New Orleans, Fred Vinson, an assistant with expertise in shooting mechanics, introduced himself and went right into a lecture. He said he knew Ingram was entering a contract year, and warned the organization would hold his poor shooting -- about 33% on 3s, 66% at the line -- against him. Vinson said he would be in the Pelicans' gym the next morning if Ingram wished to work.  Ingram showed up. Vinson told Ingram he was pointing his right foot inward upon his release, sapping power from his legs and throwing his body out of alignment -- another voice offering to repair Ingram's game. Vinson slapped tape onto the floor and would not let Ingram shoot unless his toes were straight across the tape. Vinson stood behind Ingram, reaching his arms up, warning Ingram not to bring the ball back so far as to hit him.  Ingram and the other young players then left for some summer time away from the team. He asked Vinson for notes and drills to do. Vinson emailed them.  When Ingram returned in September 2019, his jumper looked so good, Vinson pulled aside Trajan Langdon, the Pelicans' GM, and asked if Ingram had played some sort of trick on him, officials recalled.  On road trips, Ingram asked Vinson to arrange for a gym to be ready for him to shoot when the Pelicans landed. Ball started joining them. In 5-on-5 portions of practice, Ingram sometimes refuses to be subbed out. ""He'll tell me to f--- off and get someone else,"" Hart said.  Ingram tripled his 3-point attempts last season. He hit 39% from deep, and 85% at the line. Vinson wants more: at least seven 3s per game, and more pull-up 3s. Ingram is 12-of-33 on pull-up triples after making just 19 last season. If that becomes a reliable shot, there will be no foolproof scheme for Ingram on the pick-and-roll.  It would help to get Ingram the ball on the move so he is not operating from a standstill. That has been slow going, as Ingram and new teammates hammer out timing. ""He's still a slight player,"" Griffin said. ""If he gets the ball at a dead stop, it doesn't take a lot to keep him from getting momentum.""  Ingram has a nascent post game for use when smaller guys switch onto him, though he needs more force there, too. His defense has improved, in part because the Pelicans have him guarding wings instead of power forwards who can bulldoze him.  Two weeks ago, Stackhouse texted Ingram after one game and suggested he could get lower in his stance. Ingram replied that he agreed, even if he will always be more of an upright defender who makes up ground with length and speed. The Pelicans are on Ingram to stop peeking behind for oncoming screens, and to always find someone to box out.  Quiet by nature, Ingram is easing into a leadership role after showing deference to Jrue Holiday last season. Another 3-on-3 game with special rules required Ingram to shout the name of every teammate he passed to -- a method of bringing out his voice.  ""It helped me get comfortable,"" Ingram said.  Ingram is popular in the locker room, and coaches last season began using him as a conduit to deliver messages to Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Jaxson Hayes, and other young players. If they heard it from Ingram, it might carry more weight.  A more outgoing Ingram said he might one day accept more endorsements. His representatives wish he would. ""He's got a beautiful smile, but he's not about that stuff,"" Stackhouse said. ""He just wants to hoop.""  There is still a huge gap between the present and where Ingram thinks he and New Orleans can go one day. Other confidantes have heard Ingram state similarly lofty goals to the one he once told Redick. ""It's almost eerie to hear a kid say, 'I want to be the best ever,'"" Stackhouse said.  The Pelicans are 5-7, their roster a bit of a mish-mash. But Ingram's belief is unwavering.  ""I know,"" Ingram said, ""that we are building something special here."""
"Second season and he‚Äôs already made plenty of mistakes like cutting Christian Wood before last season despite Derrick Favors being our only good Big man on the team. The other options were Jahlil Okafor, rookie Jaxson Hayes and Niko Melli üíÄ"
"That 30-inch average is also a standing vert, which it sounds like you‚Äôre comparing to your max.   A lot of top prospects don‚Äôt ever do official/published max vert testing, so any average you see is probably too low anyway. In the 2019 draft, the top eight picks all sat the physical testing out. The ninth pick, Jaxson Hayes, had a 34.5-inch max vert, and he‚Äôs a 6-11 center. So his max vertical (which I‚Äôd guess is probably about league average) is about 140% of your vertical.   Also, consider the athleticism of Tacko Fall (26.5‚Äù max) and Boban Marjanovic (23‚Äù max). Your 25‚Äù estimate for your max vert is roughly in between two generally unathletic giants. Gobert, who I‚Äôd say makes both guys look like snails, ‚Äúonly‚Äù has a max vert of about 29‚Äù. A few extra inches in vertical max is a lot."
"To be fair, Karl was a 15th pick, the team's #1 option was Adrian Dantley who was a forward and averaged 30 points per game, and the team had Thurl Bailey at PF who had a great year the year before, so Malone had to share minutes with him at the PF while Dantley was basically on the floor the entire game at SF. This was also a time when in the NBA when you always had a centre on the floor and would never put Malone at the 5. If Malone had the opportunity to play 40 minutes as a rookie, he would have, and I doubt he would have been gassed after 30. As soon as Dantley left, the jazz moved Bailey to the 3 and Malone basically averaged 40 min per season for the next 15 years.  Contrast that with Zion - an ultra-hyped #1 pick who can play the 3, 4 or 5 in today's NBA and has to share frontcourt minutes at 3 positions with Ingram, Steven Adams and..... Nicolo Melli???..... Hernangomez?????.......Jaxson Hayes?????????  Seriously, we're talking 144 possible frontcourt minutes per game at his position(s), and Zion Williamson, the league's most hyped prospect in a decade is averaging playing only 22.5% of them while sharing them with Ingram, Adams, Melli, Hernangomez and Jaxson Hayes. Does that make sense to anyone on paper?  The reality is, he frequently look totally gassed after being on the floor for 5 minutes, so it makes sense that he's only getting 30 minutes per game."
Jaxson Hayes is a horrible rim protector
"There is also a risk on them starting to contribute only in their 4th year, before hitting RFA. Something that will happen with Jaxson Hayes, in all likelihood."
"He played half assed. Trade was hanging over the locker room, that's a disruptive influence. And also... Last thing. They got Zion from their pick and traded the Lakers pick #4 for Jaxson Hayes &amp; Naw. Their pick at that rate would have has a worse chance at #1 if he stayed. Probably would've missed the playoffs and ended up with the 12th-ish pick.  There's other things one could shit on David Griffin for in terms of his new Orleans tenure but the trades for Davis &amp; Holiday are not that."
"I think they're still in the growing phase. They have JJ and Adams to tutor the kids, but they have a shitload of picks coming in, and Bledsoe was part of the price of getting those picks (I wouldn't be surprised if he gets dealt to a contender).      Their team is really Zion and BI, with NWA being a potential third wheel. I think a lot of the other guys are on tryout mode: Lonzo, Hart, Jaxson Hayes. I wanna see what Kira Lewis can do.      They're like two years away from expecting Zion and BI to lead them to anything at all. I bet 80% of the roster will have turned over by then. I'm guessing the priorities right now are helping the big two raise their games, developing the supporting cast, and establishing the culture."
jaxson hayes supposedly was talking trash to the lakers bench after hitting a shot like they weren't down 20 in garbage time
that would be really funny if the ref was a super hard ass and called a reach in for jaxson hayes giving kuzma a hug at the last second
Jaxson hayes talking shit to AD while down 20 lmao
Jaxson Hayes talking smack to AD and the Lakers bench while his team is getting blown the fuck out. What the hell?
Jaxson Hayes basura ass talking shit down 60
"Jaxson Hayes, garbage time hero"
I need the sprinting tree Jaxson Hayes back on the court
Nah we lived together and played all the time and just remember that some dipshit named Jaxson Hayes turns into a god against me
Sideshow Bob lookin ass haha...just occured to me with Jaxson Hayes
I have a deep hatred of Jaxson Hayes cuz my friend would always pick the Pels in 2k20 and play Hayes like he was prime Shaq in the post but with a 50% 3 for some reason
"I think his point is that the BKN FO has proven itself competent enough that -- unlike the post-LeBron Cavs -- the Nets likely wouldn't become a total dumpster fire even if all the stars left in their option years. BKN would find some sneaky solid guys in the G League; eat some salaries of guys who are still OK, just overpaid; get some picks that way and get some decent draftees; be well-coached; be in the East; etc., the end result being that they'd suck, but they'd suck in a 12th-pick-in-the-draft way rather than being a favorite for one of those guaranteed top 5 spots. So HOU ends up coming out of it with a Sekou Doumbouya, a Jaxson Hayes, a couple Ty Jeromes, and a Mfiondu Kabengele... for James fucking Harden."
"2019 #8 (Jaxson Hayes), 2019 #17 (NAW), 2022 FRP, 2023 Swap, and 2024 FRP"
"Going to the pels was pretty good, lob it up to zion and BI had the highest 3% in the league cuz all he did was hit open corner 3s...i fucking hate jaxson Hayes now tho"
What is Jaxson Hayes good at ?
Hopefully preparing to offload one of them to the pelicans so fucking Jaxson Hayes can step getting minutes.
We will trade you Jaxson Hayes for anyone who can hit a 3 more than once per game. üòÇ
"To Pels for 5 1sts, Jaxson Hayes, Nickiel Alexander-Walker, and JJ Redick. Pels could throw in another 1st and/or two 2nds if necessary."
Is this the Jaxson Hayes rant lol?
You know Jaxson Hayes is bad when Mike Muscala goes on a run against you.
"Aside from what's going on in America rn, a Jaxson Hayes offensive highlight is definitely the most surprising thing I've seen today"
"Yeah , i saw one last year when someone passed it to Jaxson Hayes and he was like flabbergasted and pissed . I was just shaking my head like broo read the rules haha."
Jaxson Hayes.
"Coby White, Jaxson Hayes, Devonte Graham, TJ Warren &amp; Steven Adams. (Besides the obvious must watch stars)"
jaxson hayes would like a word punk.
"Well they can't trade Ingram and don't think they would give up Zion. Lonzo has 1 year left on his deal and wouldn't be a great fit, Jaxson Hayes is a no, so what exactly outside of picks?"
Jaxson Hayes looks like those kids from a white suburb that talk so much shit
"That‚Äôs Jaxson ‚Äúsuck my dick, NBA‚Äù Hayes"
Jaxson Hayes has big mouth breather energy
"Pels could have had Hunter, I like Jaxson Hayes but but they really could use a guy like Hunter"
Jaxson Hayes getting some nice stops!
Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Jaxson Hayes and Kira Lewis Jr all made some strides but then *also* promptly got injured.  I felt like we were really starting to turn a corner post-ASG and post-Minny loss too. Now everyone's just injured and we're trying to scrape by with new vets and.... Eric Bledsoe.
I don't get it either... Willy Hernangomez/Jaxson Hayes are not *that* steep of a drop-off and are not as $$$$
"Yea, Jaxson Hayes would be the closest comp from last year at 8.  I think he had more polish but less athleticism.  But he can barely get off the bench."
Everyone trying to find the next Jaxson Hayes
Jaxson Hayes is great
Jaxson Hayes
Jaxson Hayes
Can Jaxson Hayes plays as a center?
He‚Äôs been watching Jaxson Hayes‚Äô shooting stroke and taking notes
I've been wondering this a lot lately who would you prefer currently and longterm Nic Claxton or Jaxson Hayes?
I was talking about Jaxson Hayes. Killian is horrible
Lmao I was talking about Jaxson Hayes idk anything about Killian
It‚Äôs not really that good of a dunk it‚Äôs just the players have beef so it‚Äôs exciting. If you want to see some legit dunks from this season check out [this dunk by Anthony Edwards](https://youtu.be/iODDxjp936A) or [this dunk by Jaxson Hayes](https://youtu.be/OjrClzgv2Ls)
jaxson Hayes and Dillon brooks
Rent on Jaxson Hayes island is going up. Get in while you can
How much help does Jaxson Hayes need!
Jaxson Hayes in 2-3 years should time travel back
&gt; he drafted Jaxson Hayes and Nickeil Alexander-Walker  lmfaooooo
"JJJ, Jaxson Hayes are groovy for sure"
"&gt;since Jaxson Hayes has returned to the rotation, he is allowing opponents to shoot only 40.9% at the rim. That actually leads the league in that period, minimum of 20 attempts defended.  Best defender inthe league."
"This is sarcasm, right? Anyone? Help? Jaxson Hayes?"
"They will make playoffs, he drafted Jaxson Hayes and Nickeil Alexander-Walker, the team looks good."
I was gonna bring up that Jaxson Hayes dunk as well. Absolutely filthy. Zion had a real nice one too.
jaxson hayes was insane
Gotta add Jaxson Hayes too
"you've provided absolutely no evidence as to why any of those teams are better though. i can SAY ""the pelicans are gonna come back, go undefeated and win the title, with jaxson hayes as the FMVP"" but that's absurd. what makes those teams better than the jazz?"
"&gt;People like being angry at refs more than they like learning the rules.   Yes and it's tiring. The refs do miss a lot of calls, always have, but I hate it when people in here absolutely ignore reality and the rules just to bash on the refs because their favorite team lost.  Or things like Jaxson Hayes dunking on Reggie Jackson a couple days ago - I don't think more than 5% even recognized the charge. Instead everyone is *ooOhhoOhHhooooo what are you doing Reggie Jackson...??*. Casuals."
Someone should let  Jaxson Hayes know cos he straight up murdered someone yesterday.
Kanter was getting jumped by Jaxson Hayes half the game don't even start
"Nah, probably Jaxson Hayes or Rob Williams."
Honestly Jaxson Hayes is intriguing to me but I haven't watched enough pelicans to know if he's any good
"While my point of view was more of a basketball one, yours is completely true and I agree.  1st one is indeed a Big problem apparently, but I have no inside or a perspective where I can say anything besides some information provided by Mark Cuban. This also would explain why refs do that kind of stuff so It is far from invalidating my point.  2nd doesn't have to be true. It is true that league is full of highlights of posters and insane plays because the NBA itself is a product. Jaxson Hayes is a clear example of something that in a more competitive environment could have been considered a foul. However this also has to do with It being an insane highlight. Foul baiting gets the same treatment in Star players but arguably does not lead to more highlitghts. Free throws are not a highlight at all. So while the point u made could perfectly be considered as an issue for the league, It is not the only type of call refs are avoiding, which is actually against the NBA product philosophy."
"I respectfully disagree. IMO the problem with NBA officiating is:  1. Nepotism and corruption in the recruitment and training systems (Cuban covered that), resulting in mediocre refs. 2. The league values ratings and highlights more than the game of basketball.   A constant example of this is ""superstar calls"", and a great recent example of this is Jaxson Hayes' ""poster"" on Reggie Jackson. It was a clear offensive foul - Reggie was not in the restricted zone and he had legal guarding position. But no ref in the league is ever gonna call that, since a huge dunk is valued by the league more than a good defensive play (and by extension, more than the rules of the game).   And honestly, judging by this sub's response to that play, so do most fans. So until that changes, and we as fans start to demand a better \*basketball\* product, NBA refs are gonna stay trash."
You're the ref that called a tech on Jaxson Hayes for showing emotion.
Love Blake but somehow Jaxson Hayes did it better
Should be changed to Reggie Jackson shows great hustle and tried to stop Jaxson Hayes from scoring. 90% of the league wouldn‚Äôt have gotten in the way of that.

"He didn't even give dude one step.   caught the ball, one step and bam, little dude tries to take a charge.   it is bullshit basketball. Jaxson wasn't out of control or anything. set a pick, rolled, and some little dude rotates over and stands next to him and falls down.   I didn't say it wasn't technically a charge. I said it was clown shit and not a basketball play. The basketball play is rotate over and actually play defense or get the fuck out of the way.

To be fair Jaxson Hayes fucking murdered Reggie Jackson tonight
"*Suck my dick.*  \-Jaxson Hayes, probably"

Well you can suck Jaxson Hayes dick
Thoughts and prayers with Reggie Jackson‚Äôs family tonight. We lost a real baller tonight to the senseless violence of Jaxson Hayes.
Jaxson Hayes sends his regards.   ###[YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS !!!](https://youtu.be/3SQa48DcX1E)
Jaxson Hayes has a shooting touch and more defensive potential because of his length and athleticism
"‚ÄúY‚Äôall wanna see a dead body?‚Äù - Jaxson Hayes, maybe"
Jaxson Hayes woke up and chose violence
#MUTHAFUCKIN JAXSON HAYES
"If we can somehow buy low on Jaxson Hayes, I‚Äôd be down. Unfortunately his recent stretch has of good games might make NOLA reconsider"
 Naz Reid is so much better than Jaxson Hayes
"For starters, maybe beat the crap out of the previous GM for drafting Jaxson Hayes at 8.  After getting that out of the way, build around Zion and BI. Maybe keep Zo and NAW? But if you can use Zo to get an extra high first and a lottery ticket prospect, do it.  I‚Äôd be praying to the heavens to get a top three pick this year so I can select one of Cade, Mobley or Green. All of the three fit next to Zion and BI imo. Cade can play point forward while being a scoring threat on his own. Mobley allows Zion to play the 5 on offense without completely abandoning rim protection on the other end. Green is a lethal scorer that can easily slot in as a 2 and coexist with Ingram."
"To think they traded NCAA champion De‚ÄôAndre Hunter for Jaxson Hayes and Nickeil Alexander-Walker lol. To be fair, I can relate Pelicans fans considering the Sixers also traded away Mikal Bridges ahah"
"Not our fault the Pels wanted to trade down for Jaxson Hayes. And Ingram/Ball/Zion are the top 3 players on that Pels team, lol. They're not the reason they're 15-21. I don't see Bledsoe or Redick playing average defense. The entire team's defensive effort, except for Lonzo, Adams, and Hart is trash.    If you want to believe that saying ""15-21"" when we gave them an all-star, a top 5 pick, and a player who is going to get near the max invalidates my argument sure. The Pels will be in a better position than your Rockets will be for the rest of the decade."
Why are the pelicans trying to put Jaxson Hayes and Steven Adams next to Zion? I like David Griffin but I don‚Äôt think that makes sense. I think they‚Äôd have been better off keeping that fourth pick and grabbing hunter while still getting Lewis this year.
"It made no sense, they drafted Jaxson hayes really high and then traded for n gave Adams a nice sized deal, just to play him next to Zion.  I'm perplexed because David Griffin is a smart guy"
"Four of the next five players drafted after Jaxson Hayes make that pick look terrible - Hachimura, Cam Johnson, PJ Washington and Tyler Herro."
I don‚Äôt like the extension either. But let‚Äôs say Jaxson Hayes takes over as the starter mid next year. Then you go into next off-season with him as a 17M expiring. That‚Äôs not the albatross people pretend it is
Pelicans are developing a stretch 5 in house. Jaxson Hayes. And the whole point for Adams is so that two paint defenders can‚Äôt double Zion or else Adams just gets the easy tip-in. 2 points is still 2 points regardless of who scores it.
"Jaxson Hayes is an outdated center? 7 foot, switchable, and expanding his range? mkay"
"The improvement of Jaxson Hayes this season has been awesome. I‚Äôm excited to see next season and have him and NAW getting more minutes, and hopefully no Bledsoe"
Jaxson Hayes will be a third year center off the bench. Millsap is over the hill too.
Is jaxson hayes ceiling Wilt Chamberlain? Why not???
"Meh, young players and lack of team practices fault more than a coaching issue this season. The fact that he‚Äôs molded Jaxson Hayes into a potential stud shows a lot of promise. Im actually excited to see what he can do with an actual training camp and team practices between games."
I mean by abusing the hell out of the prompt.  PG- Trae/Ja/Lamelo  SG- Luka/SGA/Herro  SF-Kawhi/Mikal Bridges/Dort  PF- AD/Zion/TJ leaf (need a minimum salary guy)  C- Ayton/Jaxson Hayes/insert minimum guy  &amp;#x200B;  Boom below salary cap and most definitely an all time great team.
When did Jaxson Hayes decide he can make stepback 3s? My man had as many threes in one games as he had the whole year.
Jaxson Hayes
Jaxson Hayes range
Jaxson Hayes 3/3 from three.  How come someone has some totally out of character shooting night against us every night lol
Jaxson Hayes most threes in a game
jaxson hayes aka the ugliest player in the league
jaxson hayes had a nice game against the hornets
"I really hope Lonzo Zion and Ingram can all be on teams that suit their play style some day. Lonzo and Zion work well together, but I don't think the rest of the roster works very well with Lonzo (except for Jaxson Hayes but he's still developing)."
Get rid of Bledsoe and Adams ASAP. Try to add some defense/shooting in place of Bled at the shooting guard and look for a rim protector at the 5. Use the Bledsoe and Adams contracts as filler and bundle with the firsts from the Jrue/AD trades to try and get some pieces to compete with.   Some other ideas I‚Äôve considered is the pelicans moving Lonzo to shooting guard and trading for a point guard like Spencer Dinwiddie.   It also looks like Jaxson Hayes is starting to put it together. Maybe he gets the promotion to starter and they just go all in on finding more shooting.
Size: Zion to 6‚Äô10‚Äù  Skill: Jaxson Hayes  Athleticism: NAW
Who has the better name: Killian Hayes or Jaxson Hayes? I'm leaning towards Jaxson but Killian Hayes is a cool-ass sounding name too.
"FATE OF THE UNIVERSE ON THE LINE, I WANT JAXSON HAYES"
jaxson hayes
Jaxson Hayes is such a great name for a ball player. Very old school sounding.
them Ball boys are nice with it   also Jaxson Hayes has gotten a lot better as the season has gone on
"Jaxson ""Steven Williamson"" Hayes"
jaxson hayes kinda looks like sideshow bob
we just witnessed a Jaxson Hayes game winner
I can‚Äôt stop picturing Jaxson Hayes screaming ‚ÄúSUG MY DIG!‚Äù whenever he makes an explosive play like this.
"Jaxson hayes, Robert Williams, Daniel Gafford. Always enjoying watching these rim running bigs inject energy into the game"
"Do you understand how bad the expected value of a bottom half of the lottery pick is? Here's the last 10 #8th overall picks   Obi Toppin  Jaxson Hayes  Collin Sexton   Frank Ntilikina  Marquese Chriss  Stanley Johnson  Nik Stauskas   Kentavious Caldwell-Pope   Terrance Ross   Brandon Knight    Look at this list. Sabonis is way, way better than basically every single person listed. The average expected value of the 8th pick or lower is like ""solid role player"", not ""All Star"".    Even the Raptors would trade a low lottery pick for Sabonis. Even if he doesn't fit your system, Sabonis would be more beneficial to you than some decent role player that you're most likely going to draft."
Also how TF does Jaxson Hayes do what he did in the first half to you? That can‚Äôt happen. I love Jax‚Äôs potential but he‚Äôs no where near polished enough to score that effectively unless you‚Äôre defense sucks or your not trying.

So annoying I was there and wanted to Zion so bad. Got the Jaxson Hayes experience which was cool he had a hell of a game. But he‚Äôs no Zion
"Jaxson Hayes is a lot of fun to watch. His dunks are tremendous, his putbacks are spectacular, and he can make people look like fucking fools under the basket. I hope he keeps developing and has a big ass career ahead of him."
Man I was just loving the Jaxson Hayes Dwight thrash talk. That was fun.
"some rough rough shooting by pels, but they're holding their own thanks to the heroics of jaxson hayes"
"Jaxson Hayes is like ""fuck it, I'm going for 40."""

that's ok you can watch jaxson hayes do his impression of shaq
"I misplaced the comma it‚Äôs supposed to be after wizards but the warriors tanked a season for that dude  Lamelo was right there.. plus a lot of other good wing players to pair with Curry, wiseman isn‚Äôt a good fit he‚Äôs more of a jaxson Hayes than an embiid  Saw so many warriors fans laughing when they got the #2 pick saying league was fucked lmao"
"Maybe if he traded for players who could hit jump shots, zion could go to work down there? Instead, this moron traded for Steven Adams ($29 m, and a $19 m extension coming, signed off again by this same moron), Eric Bledsoe ($16 m), and James Johnson ($16 m).   This guy also drafted a lane clogging center in Jaxson Hayes at 8 over Tyler Herro.   Whose idea of a lineup combinations of the following is a good idea:  Zion.  Adams.   Ingram  .       .   Hayes.    Johnson . Bledsoe.   Ball Lewis.   .   Hart?  What possible lineup is going to give proper spacing?   They could have gotten into the Turner for Hayward SnT and send picks to Boston, or they could have just sent #4 for him to Indy after the AD trade. But, this idiot thinks he has the magic touch with drafting.   Yes, zion is getting hacked. But it's partially your fault because of incompetence. Maybe he'll stfu and hire someone who doesn't eat glue and then let that person make personnel decisions for him."
Starting power forward Jaxson Hayes is back on the menu
"&gt; &gt;1. **Re-Sign Lonzo Ball or let him walk?**   Let RFA play out. New Orleans has the upper hand in regards to holds. Work out a S&amp;T if the price looks to get to be too much.   &gt; &gt;2. **What to do with Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe?**   Move Bledsoe as salary ballast for a bigger move as MKE did, using actual assets to offset his poor value on the court. This is preferable this off season but could be pushed to trade deadline.   Adams is... Fine. At 17M he's not a value, but not crippling. Jaxson Hayes or a better acquired C can easily take his minutes as season goes on. Again, could be moved as salary ballast in off season or at the deadline.   &gt; &gt;3. **Keep coach Stan Van Gundy?**   SVG is going nowhere. He was brought in for long term development and stability. Considering the next to no off season and limited practice time this season, the individual development of young players has been fine. Team defense has actually improved as the season has gone on. He's likely not the answer for a contender, but he'll get at minimum one more year.   &gt; &gt;4. **What to do with Brandon Ingram?**   Ingram has already been paid. He is a big question long term if his defense doesn't improve, but they will give him at least another year unless the perfect fit alongside Zion becomes available. He fits well with the city of New Orleans and star level players actually wanting to be here should not be taken for granted. If he regresses in fit/defense this can and will be revisited next off season."
"Baze made under the radar stupid plays, like not boxing out Jaxson Hayes letting him get his own putback in a crucial moment. But his defense on Lonzo‚Äôs final shot I thought was fine, Lonzo made a tough look."
They were also missing Zion and Favors for a lot of the season. Their biggest losing streak came when Favors went out and had to depend on rookie Jaxson Hayes and Okafor as their starting big. I think Lowry would help a lot if you replace him with Bledsoe. (personally Lowry is &gt; Jrue for me)

*Jaxson Hayes enters the chat*
"Willy Hernangomez, Jaxson Hayes, and Wenyen Gabriel were all so good tonight.  Willy was a difference-maker and just gives the guys an energy boost that I don't think we get all the time."
"You clearly have no idea on how difficult the game is for big men who are asked to rim protect and play off ball. ""Just run and jump, shoot it occasionally, how hard can it be?"" NBA players aren't stupid, and you can't just overpower everyone with your physical tools. Draymond is a great defender, yes, but defense has way more nuances than just jumping higher or moving faster than the attacker. It's about reading and predicting what the offense wants to do, and being able to react and appear at the right place at the right time consistently. You're asking a high school kid who's used to just swat everything that comes his way, to suddenly be able to make sound rotations over and over again against NBA level offense. Also, the Warriors offense was never designed to let big men get easy looks, I don't know where the hell you pulled that impression from. The ""easy looks"" you're talking about are for off ball cutters and good rollers, which Wiseman is neither, because he's never had to be. Being the roller against NBA defenses is a tricky skill that emphasizes a lot on timing, and in the past Wiseman didn't have to care about timing, because he could just score on guys even if they cut him off or contested. He's also not a shooting threat yet, so it's not surprising. The only reason you're feeling disappointed is because you never bothered to think about his circumstances and just read all his upside and overblown rhetoric about him being ""THE NEXT AD"" bullshit from ESPN. You keep saying he's bad, but never had the second thought of actually examining the reasons why. Basketball is not a on paper sport. Actually watch games and know context before you make judgements. Wiseman has it quite rough, and it's a common trend for young big men of his type. I think you're also kind of overestimating this year's talent pool. Wiseman is #2 in this draft, but he's probably #7 or #8 in 2021, kinda like Jaxson Hayes, who btw is a comparable typing to Wiseman. Maybe do some film watching and watch, say, how Jarrett Allen plays compared to Wiseman, the defensive and off ball skills difference between them is not something you just learn in a summer transitioning from no live games to the NBA."
"Probably best to just get a good defensive one and have a solid backup who can shoot. Jaxson Hayes has potential to develop into a center who can shoot, rim protect, and guard the perimeter, so that may not be a problem in the future."
"At the very least 1 lotto pick, but a more realistic offer would be like the Pelicans offering 2 FRPs and Jaxson Hayes for him. Wood will net you a couple mid-late firsts and a young prospect"
Jaxson Hayes already kicking it off
He's a poor man's Jaxson Hayes.
Jaxson Hayes can suck Green's dick
"???   2018: 8th pick sexton. 6th pick; mo bamba. 9th pick; kevin knox   2019: 5th pick garland. 6th pick; jarrett culver. 8th pick; jaxson hayes   2020: 5th pick okoro. still early, but opi toppin was picked 8th who we were rumored to take.   like, i know the sentiment was like that before 2016, but we've had shit luck in the last three years and still managed to get quality players that have a floor of being productive starters in playoff teams. still have a lot to learn from Masai/Bobby who manage to strike gold with prospects at the end of the first/second round or undrafted though."
Noel was only a 4/70 when guys like Mozgov were getting 4/64. And yeah most athletic centers have weaknesses especially on offense usually lacking a post game or IQ. Some aren't even good enough to get consistent minutes like Willie Cauley-Stein or Jaxson Hayes.
"CP3 had as much success with the Hornets as he did evertwhere else he went.   AD had daddy Lebron win him a championship.   Since AD, we have a different owner, front office, medical staff and coaching staff. The only things that have  remained the same from AD to Zion are the uniforms, arena and Fred Vinson.   The team currently has 2 Allstars under 24. They have the 2nd most 1st round picks in the leauge through 2027. They have 3 promising young players in Jaxson Hayes, NAW and Kira Lewis. So what is the incompetence you're talking about outside of Eric Bledsoe?"
"Basketball players already do sacrifice some salary to get the team they want (both KD and Bron have done so in the past). But the amount of money we‚Äôre talking about some players sacrificing under a hard cap could be more than Sidney Crosby‚Äôs entire yearly salary. That‚Äôs especially so because it would seem to require several guys to take smaller pay cuts, or for one guy (probably the last guy drafted) to take a huge cut.   To make this all more concrete, let‚Äôs use the Pelicans as an example. Assuming a $115M salary cap and current max contract rules, BI is going to command 25% of that, Lonzo at least 15%, and Zion 30%. That leaves $34.5M for the entire rest of the team, meaning a $3M average salary for each of the remaining 11 players. Is that doable? Yes. But it gets much harder when you factor in NAW, Josh Hart, Jaxson Hayes, and the cornucopia of other first round picks they have coming up. (I‚Äôm assuming Bledsoe and Adams are long gone.) Even if you assume the hard cap would be higher than the current cap, at least one important young guy (Zion, NAW, or some as-yet-undrafted guy) is going to have to take a big cut or go.  But honestly, as I work through this in more depth, I realize that it‚Äôs going to back fire spectacularly if what you want is parity. If star players, who are already underpaid compared to their value, are further expected to take (especially large) pay cuts, they‚Äôll just go ahead and take those pay cuts to play with other stars.   You‚Äôd basically need no max contract and a hard cap to prevent that, and there‚Äôs absolutely no way the players association would agree to those rules."
Clearly you didn‚Äôt see the Jaxson Hayes ‚Äúfoul‚Äù on Gobert last season.
NOLA fans: how‚Äôs Jaxson Hayes been?
"**Pelicans fans:** How's Jaxson Hayes looked this season?  I know he was extremely raw and Adams is taking a lot of his minutes, but how's he played overall? I also saw a couple moments where SVG played Hayes and Adams together, how effective has that lineup been?"
Jaxson Hayes has full monopoly on the sideshow bob lookalikes for the league
"To draft Jaxson Hayes, NAW, and get of Solo‚Äôs contract*   He already admitted blame to the roster fit this year, but tbh this year was never a win now year. It was basically year 1 of BI and Zion learning to play together. The adams thing is decent but not awful, Jonathan Redick is a diva and even got clowned by The Jump for all that and they tend to be negative on the Pelicans, cap space for what?   There are some issues for sure but this is kinda just skewed. We‚Äôre 2 years into a rebuild, have 20 and 23 yr old all stars, couple other promising young guys, and like the 2nd most draft picks over the next 5-10 years in the nba."
He traded Holiday for picks because he didn't fit the timeline.   Jaxson Hayes is developing and started showing an outside shot this year. There's this silly belief that 7 foot 3 point snipers grow on trees. They don't. Adams was signed to a cheaper number and will platoon next year with Hayes. Then the plan is for his last year to use him as an expiring asset.  The part that doesn't make sense is firing SVG. We started showing progress. Which with no real preseason means that we started this year behind the curve. I would have like to have given him a short leash into next year. If by game 15 we're still under .500 then you part ways. But I'm wondering how many players didn't want him here.   Also that trade back for Jaxson Hayes got us Nickiel Alexander Walker. Who is objectively one of the best picks we could have made so far at 4 anyways. So I chalk it up as a W.
They have so many assets they can easily move off of him. They signed Adams because they weren‚Äôt sure that Jaxson Hayes could play full time center minutes.  They will probably hold onto him for one more year while Hayes develops and then use one of the bucks or Lakers picks to get rid of his salary and Jaxson will hopefully be able to start.
[One on Jaxson Hayes](https://youtu.be/qwt4pzdEigE)
Jaxson Hayes is a better prospect than James Wiseman.
"Hart is just a role player who shot 32% from 3, and NAW, who we got in the AD trade, was better than Lonzo when he started. We also got Jaxson Hayes in that trade and more picks in the future.  We could bring back both Lonzo and Josh Hart if we want to, but not bringing them back at all may be better than overpaying for them. They‚Äôre both really inconsistent."
Jaxson Hayes or NAW
Pelicans for Jaxson Hayes
Why would I trade Jaxson Hayes for Zingis?
"Im a honest homer. But Brandon Clarke makes me tingle all the right ways.   Outside from home, Jaxson Hayes is a lovely man with really long arms and legs and a lot of energy. Hope he gets better and for the Pelicans!"
Jaxson Hayes will be better than Myles Turner. No thanks.
"JJJ, Jaxson Hayes, Mo Bamba, Mitch Robinson. Natural talent and athleticism doesn't mean anything if it  a skillset doesn't develop along with it either. Wiseman's biggest problem is he doesn't really contribute anything positively on an NBA court right now aside from his height and length."
My hot take is that Jaxson Hayes is a better prospect than Wiseman
Lonzo and Jaxson Hayes
people forget that Chris Grant gave David Griffin an absolute war chest   taking Jaxson Hayes after Zion was just so god damn stupid
"Horford costs 10 million more a year and is 7 years older.  They structured Adams so they could still develop Jaxson Hayes to move into the lineup. First half of the year he was terrible. Second half he looked pretty good.  People can rightly complain about the pelicans underachieving but did they really once they traded Jrue?  One of the league‚Äôs youngest rosters while Zion, Hayes, NAW, and Lonzo all showed improvement throughout the year."
I did Jaxson Hayes and got 7

"Jaxson Hayes is gonna be better than Turner. Turner is so fucking overrated it‚Äôs insane. No defender cares about his 3pt shot, only like 3 centers actually get their jumper respected."
"BI was a good defender with the Lakers, and he‚Äôs shown glimpses of being a good defender with us. He just needs to be consistent. He was playing solid defensively during the last couple months of the season. He just said today that he‚Äôs going to work on becoming a good defender this offseason, and with his work ethic I have to believe him.  Also, Jaxson Hayes is going to be our center of the future. He can rim protect, guard the perimeter, and he as a solid jump shot. He has a lot of potential, he just needs to grow."
Was Jaxson Hayes a few months ago. Now he‚Äôs finally showing some real promise
"Can you imagine how good the Wolves future would look if they had another good young player instead of Culver, even if it was ""just"" low upside guys like Cam Johnson or PJ Washington.  It's 100% Culver, kudos to Jaxson Hayes tho, he looked like a bust for 1,5 season, but he's been really really really good in the past few months"
What? Literally even Jaxson Hayes or Dwight Howard can dribble the ball up the court while keeping their head up
Jaxson Hayes tapping his head after that dunk on reggie Jackson
"I'm not too interested in Lonzo, Kira Lewis or NAW. We have enough guards.   I'd aceept Adams or Bledsoe+ 10 for Lowry or Bled+ Jaxson Hayes+filler.   There's also the added caveat that Lowry has to WANT to go there. Seems like he's going to have a fair few suitors. NOP probably needs to pay him 3/75 or something."
"&gt; Your downside is you've got another Matisse Thybulle on your hands that you just burned a Top 5 pick on.  2019 redraft, where does Thybulle go? Top 3 are pretty obviously Zion, Morant and Garland imo, but after that it gets a lot shakier. I'm not saying anyone should take Thybulle over RJ Barrett, but he's got a pretty strong case to go over Jaxson Hayes."

"Dude our bench is full of young players with lots of potential. The main problems this year were Bledsoe getting way to much playtime and SVG being an old dinosaur who couldn‚Äôt connect with his players. A lot of our bench players show promise like NAW, Kira, and especially Jaxson Hayes."
it's Jaxson Hayes GF  i'm not that down bad though. i just do my research :(
Yeah that's better. My other initial one was Jaxson Hayes but he's not at this level yet. Christian Wood also crossed my mind.
Even lonzo is a better fit than Zach lavine. Maybe they can grab Jaxson Hayes if it's not too late
"Lonzo, NAW, Jaxson Hayes, pick 10 &gt; Wiseman, 7, 14  Bledsoe contract (17mil 2021, only 4mil gtd 2022 making him easily releasable) &gt; Wiggins contract (31mil/yr for 2 more years)"
Mitchell Robinson or Jaxson Hayes for OKC
"From the 2019 Draft, Jaxson Hayes ranks:  - 3rd in Win Shares per 48  - 6th in VORP  - 5th in BPM   That's not good enough for the 8th pick? From the rawest prospect in the top half of the draft? No potential, nope. LOL."
"I would‚Äôve picked Garland. Jaxson Hayes has not shown himself to be an NBA player, and has made no improvements in his first 2 years. Not to mention playing him next to Zion makes no sense and NAW is just okay."
"Hunter is injury prone and our guys don‚Äôt need 2 more years. NAW should‚Äôve been starting last year but SVG refused to play him over Bledsoe. Jaxson Hayes was horrible at the beginning of the season, but looked great in the second half of the season.  Non-pelicans fans who didn‚Äôt really watch the team much last year will se how good they both are next year."
Jaxson Hayes and NAW are good and I don‚Äôt regret the trading for them instead of drafting constantly injured Hunter
I do watch the team. I know they have the worst spacing in the league. I know it‚Äôs not controversial to say I‚Äôd rather have DeAndre Hunter or Darius Garland over Jaxson hayes and Nickeil Alexander-Walker.
"It's for Hayes' development. If Jaxson Hayes can play PF, the amount of roster flexibility and potential lineups the Pelicans have access to goes way up. Name one combination of players besides *maybe* Bol-Jokic that could guard Hayes-Adams if it works out.          It's steeped in the same principle as Davis-Cousins."
They traded out cause they wanted the top center in Jaxson Hayes who they got at #9 and then was able to snag NAW too
Jaxson Hayes.   His form and FT% always suggested he could become a reliable shooter and towards the end of the year he demonstrated it. He also brings a ton of energy with potential as a very athletic rim-running shot blocker. If he puts it all together he can be a major player.
"CP3, NAW, BI, Zion &amp; Jaxson Hayes (pls Chris)"
Pels should just be looking to develop internally. Jaxson Hayes is likely a starting caliber center during or after next season. He showed off a little bit of a three point shot at the end of the year as well. The Pelicans should focus more on getting a center that can defend at a high level rather than a center that can shoot. Trade Adams if the deal is there but I‚Äôm okay keeping him till his contract expires.
Jaxson Hayes üò§
Jaxson Hayes
"Lonzo almost certainly wouldn't be involved because he's a RFA. It's possible, but complicated.   The real question is if BI goes or not.   If BI stays, a starting lineup of Dame, Lonzo, BI, Zion and Adams or Jaxson Hayes will put up record breaking offense and the only question will be defense and depth.   They can use Bledsoe and remaining picks to grab defense and depth though, targeting guys like Hield, Barnes, Duncan Robinson, Norman Powell, OG Anunoby and maybe PJ Tucker.  Regardless of whl they get to fill out the roster, that's definitely a top 3 seed if healthy.   If BI goes, that'll likely leave the Pelicans with 5ish tradable 1st round picks along with 5ish swaps and at least one promising young player. Basically what the Clippers gave up for PG.   They could use those to go for the 3rd star, along with salary from Bledsoe or Adams to go after a guy like Jeremi Grant, Jaylen Brown, Siakam, Sabonis, Donovan Mitchell, PG, SGA or KAT, depending on who becomes available."
"Pelicans only because they cant get worse than what they are rn. They have a bunch of picks, young star(Brandon Ingram) other young players(S&amp;T Lonzo Ball, Jaxson Hayes, Nickeil Alexander-Walker) to trade for Dame. Dame + Zion a better duo than Ingram-Zion."
&gt; That‚Äôs why we have perennial MVP candidate Willie Carly-Stein.  Jaxson Hayes is on the line for that 2x B2B MVP and DPOY
Jaxson Hayes
"The rumors are predicated on the Pelicans giving up assets for a stretch-5 instead of developing the jump shot of Jaxson Hayes. Obviously, if you can get a stretch-5 for cheap, you do it, but New Orleans is probably going to exploring the Jaxson Hayes route first. Particularly because if the Hayes-Adams combination works, it opens up so many possibilities and exploitable mismatches.  And the Pelicans have 7 seconds between the 2021/2022 drafts."
"I‚Äôm not terribly familiar with depth but I heard a pelicans beat writer suggest that if the cavs really like someone at pick 10 then that plus one of our young guys that can fit the timeline for less money than they‚Äôd pay sexton ljke Kira Lewis, NAW, or jaxson Hayes and maybe another pick or pick swap as I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs a fair value for sexton as he seems like an offensive stud, but trade for him means sign him big bucks right away. Not sure if another team could beat that offer easily or not tho"
Jaxson Hayes instantly pops in my head
"2019 Jaxson Hayes, Texas ‚Äì New Orleans Pelicans   2018 Collin Sexton, Alabama ‚Äì Cleveland Cavaliers  2017 Frank Ntilikina, France ‚Äì New York Knicks  2016 Marquese Chriss, Washington ‚Äì Sacramento Kings  2015 Stanley Johnson, Arizona ‚Äì Detroit Pistons  2014 Nik Stauskas, Michigan ‚Äì Sacramento Kings  2013 Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Georgia ‚Äì Detroit Pistons  2012 Terrence Ross, Washington ‚Äì Toronto Raptors  2011 Brandon Knight, Kentucky ‚Äì Detroit Pistons  2010 Al-Farouq Aminu, Wake Forest ‚Äì L.A. Clippers  The #8 picks have been dreadful for the last decade. You really gotta get lucky to end up in the top 4 and draft someone good. This year was their chance."
Jaxson hayes has a great one so far but he is very mediocre as a player.
"Or we could just not acquire Turner in the first place and spend the assets elsewhere. As I said, it's more effective to develop the game of Jaxson Hayes."
"Unless we‚Äôre doing a 1 for 1 swap with Bledsoe, I disagree. It is simply more effective to develop Jaxson Hayes in house. I‚Äôd rather focus on improving our guard play as that‚Äôs where most of our issues lie."
"&gt; The Center position is so thin  with those other 4 playing, just roll with Jaxson Hayes or some shit there and it's still a wrap"
Jaxson Hayes dunking on everyone and shooting threes next season
"If you watch the [Jaxson Hayes over Reggie Jackson dunk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zivupzaLOf0) from this season, he starts patting the top of his head and with my amateur lip reading skills I think he says ""ON HIS FUCKING HEAD!"""
"We would need a center who can rim protect and hold his own on the perimeter, rebound, and space the floor. Ideally by shooting and being athletic enough to catch lobs.  The problem is that those guys are hard to find. We‚Äôre developing one on Jaxson Hayes, but he may be a year away from being ready to start.   We‚Äôd need to compromise 1 or 2 of those requirements to realistically find a center who can fit with Zion. Ibaka (If healthy) and Turner would be solid. We may just need to save the assets and roll with Steven Adams, until Jaxson Hayes develops."
&gt;!above quote is a joke. Jaxson Hayes of the Pelicans actually said it after he was snubbed from the Rising Stars game a couple years ago.!&lt;
I‚Äôll say two things   1. Give a coach time   2. The fit with Zion and Steven Adams or Jaxson Hayes or Derrick Favors doesn‚Äôt work
"You've clearly missed Jaxson Hayes developing his 3 point shot, and based off his free throw mechanics, I think Hayes has a real chance of developing into the very stretch big everybody wants the Pelicans to give up assets for."
"He‚Äôs probably watching the Grizzlies, Hawks, &amp; Knicks (who drafted right after him) in the playoffs with their draft picks on good teams already making noise in the post season. Zion‚Äôs up there with the best up and coming guys like Luka, Tatum etc. but won‚Äôt get the chance to show with the current group of guys around him. Zion wanted to stay another year at Duke originally because he wanted to win the Natty. I think his money will be straight regardless but the kid wants to win. Griffin‚Äôs plan for sustainable success has had mixed results, good being that Jaxson Hayes looks like a good piece for the future, along with Nickeil, maybe Kira but keeping Bledsoe around, signing Adams to an extension, which i wasn‚Äôt too opposed to at the time but his health is questionable and he doesn‚Äôt really defend the rim. With the assets we have, the FO can put together some things right now, maybe not a superstar or another all star but some guys that could get us into the playoffs. He doesn‚Äôt want to suck for 5 years like Devin Booker had to go through."
"Welp they saw that they had major issues Suring up the paint with Favors, so they got one of the better rebounding bigs in the league. They wanted to be competitive and Jaxson Hayes was absolute garbage early in the season so you can't really blame them for wanting a veteran presence in the paint. They did overpay though, but it isn't the end of the world."
This is just really funny to me.  Just a few weeks ago it was about jaxson Hayes and the police brutality.  Now it‚Äôs about this?
"Zion also improved a ton over the course of the season, as did Alexander-Walker and Jaxson Hayes. The Wolves won 19 and 23 games the last 2 years and their roster isn't in anyway better. Edwards is going to get so much better that they are going to leap frog the Pels who also have a bunch of young guys who are getting better?"
‚ÄúThe NBA can suck my bone‚Äù - Bones ‚ÄúJaxson Hayes‚Äù Hyland
"i wouldn't say he was *great* at it here, but his PnR partners are Zion, Val, and Jaxson Hayes now instead of Zeller, Bismack, Bridges, PJ Washington. I think he'll be better for NOLA than Lonzo was, especially in the halfcourt where he's a better shot creator and facilitator."
"This is basically their depth chart now right?  Devonte' Graham / Tomas Satoransky / Kira Lewis  Nickeil Alexander-Walker / Josh Hart  Brandon Ingram / Garrett Temple / Trey Murphy  Zion Williamson / Wenyen Gabriel  Jonas Valanciunas / Jaxson Hayes / Willy Hernang√≥mez  They could be a play in team but their defense is probably going to be terrible again this next year and their bench is not good. They'll need to have like a top 3 offense to be a decent team.  Considering they have a dude averaging 27 PPG on great efficiency making 10M/year, probably being a below average team in their conference is pretty bad imo."
If that last lob was for Jaxson Hayes the poster dunk would have been legendary. Fuck a layup
"Oh, Jaxson Hayes is another one I don't see becoming a good player at all. But I'm not hating on the Pelicans and I really like Trey Murphy."
"Looks like a kid. Can‚Äôt teach speed. I had other wants available at that spot. Griff likes raw potential, which is why he grabbed kira and jaxson hayes. Too early to say."
"He was #50 in his class and was playing behind first round picks pretty much every year.  Texas has mismanaged a lot of their program, but their development of bigs is not where they struggle.   Past 5 years:  Kai Jones #51 prospect in class -&gt; 1st round, 19th pick  Jericho Sims #50 prospect in class -&gt; 2nd round, 58th pick  Jaxson Hayes -&gt; #102 prospect in class -&gt; 1st round, 8th pick  Mo Bamba -&gt; #3 prospect in class -&gt; 1st round, 6th pick  Jarrett Allen -&gt; #17 prospect in class -&gt; 1st round, 22nd pick  Myles Turner -&gt; #6 prospect in class -&gt; 1st round, 11th pick"
People get extremely sensitive and defensive when they get minorly criticized for saying some stupid shit. Also a lot of people on this sub are very stupid. Go look at the original Jaxson Hayes arrest thread.
"Jaxson Hayes the foul machine? I can understand if you had said he was one of the guys with the highest potential of becoming the best defender on the team but I don‚Äôt think you can consider him the best defender on the team when he can‚Äôt stop fouling and is generally making bad decisions  He‚Äôs too green for that title, imo. Although he has the physical tools to reach it, I don‚Äôt believe he has the iq to get there, much less that he was at the level you are claiming him to have been at, at any point last season.  Although I must say I don‚Äôt have and can‚Äôt check his stats right now to back this up, I‚Äôm going from what I remember watching."
"Texas centers always got the best afros. Jarett Allen, Jaxson Hayes, Jericho Sims. Even Mo Bamba‚Äôs fade."
"if he can get through whatever his off-the-court situation is, i have real faith in Jaxson Hayes"
Jaxson Hayes
"Immanuel Quickley, Jaxson Hayes, Miles Bridges"
"Jaxson ""Suck my dick"" Hayes will be a multiple time all star pick."
Jaxson Hayes (pre-tasing)
"&gt;*honestly, the Pelicans feel like they're behind even us in roster development.*  Maybe a little bit.  Last season Coach Stan Van Gundy refused to play our younger players. He gave out a LOT of DNPs lol.  Eric Bledsoe was our most played player last season despite the fact that he hasn't acted---nor put the effort in, of an All-Defense caliber guard for majority of the season. He was terrible on both sides of the ball while our younger guys were actually pretty responsible/hard-working.  He really only wanted to play vets, and it drove the fanbase (and FO) crazy.  Because we do have young promising guys on the team that our FO *really likes*, but that didn't get to see the floor and work through their mistakes and grow from them. Jaxson Hayes, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, didn't get a lot of playtime but especially our youngest rookie Kira Lewis Jr. lol. He only gave them minutes when he was forced to because of injuries."
"Obviously not every single cop is a bad guy. But the police as a whole seems to cause massive harm while not doing much good. For example Jaxson Hayes got beat down by several police a couple days ago, and the body cam is still not out yet.   And I disagree it's naive. The police that literally murdered Eric Garner on camera didn't serve any time, and only got fired five years later. The police will most likely suffer no repercussion at all."
Jaxson Hayes vibes
"Terence Davis, Malik Beasley, Jaxson Hayes, Ron Artest, Jason Kidd. Lol and that's not even NFL yet"
This would literally leave the Pelicans with Jaxson Hayes and Willy Hernangomez at centre.
"&gt; Hayes will reportedly be charged with felony battery on a police officer, while the initial domestic disturbance is still being investigated.   https://www.si.com/nba/2021/07/28/jaxson-hayes-arrested-police-altercation-los-angeles"

I am mixed race. Jaxson Hayes is also mixed race. here I am seeing someone else of mixed race that's being held to a different standard.
y'know that Jaxson Hayes is black right?
[paragraph 2](https://apnews.com/article/sports-nba-arrests-new-orleans-pelicans-jaxson-hayes-e23c9ec7361beeb5090e0ee1ddd5e27d)  [also paragraph 2](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/47971891)  Do you have a source for that arrest?  Here are 2 separate news sources citing LAPD statements and only listing ‚Äúresisting arrest‚Äù. He also hasn‚Äôt been charged with assault or battery.
Jaxson Hayes is black. Good luck with this holding up.
this will be the only thing Jaxson Hayes is remembered for.
Jaxson Hayes is black
"""Hello, police? This is the police. Jaxson Hayes coming to call me names. Get down here and save me!"""
"From what we saw you arrested someone who wasn't attacking you, only filming... Which isn't a crime. How can we trust you when you tased Jaxson Hayes even though you already had 2 cops on top of him and controlling him. And how can we take your word even though you won't release the footage. We can't, and you won't release it because you know you're wrong. And now you're asking the NBA to fine him when in the footage you actually released you can't hear him saying what you claim he says. And if he does say it in the unreleased footage why don't you release it? Or are you trying to just be as much of a pain in the ass as possible? Most likely the latter. Fuck the Louisiana Police. A.C.A.B."
do you think Meyers Leonard was trying to insult the Jewish people or do you think he was playing a video game and screamed a cuss word?   i just know that Jaxson Hayes was pretty belligerent in that video as compared to Meyers Leonard
Adam Silver did not even back up Ujiri vs police so don‚Äôt expect Jaxson Hayes to get support from league higher ups.
"Wait, do they not realize that Jaxson Hayes is black? This is incredibly tone deaf when you also consider the fact that this letter is signed by a white man. Talk about an ass-backwards letter."
The Hayes incident has been in the news [since last week](https://www.tmz.com/2021/08/04/jaxson-hayes-arrest-video-shows-new-orleans-pelicans-center-struggling-lapd-investigating-possible-use-excessive-force/).
"Jaxson Hayes doesn't work for the police department. Do you think they send letters like this to the employer of everyone they're arresting who uses a slur? Whether Hayes was rightfully being arrested or not, this aspect is absolutely a PR move by the police department to try to change the public narrative on the incident."
[The article the letter was sourced from](https://www.tmz.com/2021/08/09/jaxson-hayes-lapd-domestic-violence-cops-injuries-nba-letter/)
Jaxson Hayes went 8th overall. And this guy is basically the same player lmao
I thought it was a white dude but Jaxson Hayes is black and they're saying this... FOH.
Jaxson Hayes suspended from Coors Field juuuuust in case
"Hearsay is also allowed if it‚Äôs a statement made by a named party, i.e. Jaxson Hayes."
"If Meyers Leonard was Jewish, he wouldn't have been suspended for making his anti-Jewish slur. It's almost like Jaxson Hayes being black makes this a remarkably different situation, assuming they're even telling the truth.     Important to note that this is the union, a largely political organization, not the actual police department, who wrote this letter. It's obvious grandstanding."
My theory is that the police were the ones using the n-word and in order to cover it up they are saying Jaxson Hayes said it.
https://www.tmz.com/2021/08/04/jaxson-hayes-arrest-video-shows-new-orleans-pelicans-center-struggling-lapd-investigating-possible-use-excessive-force/
Jaxson Hayes is black. It is not racist for a black person to say the N-Word. That‚Äôs clownish.
They want the NBA to punish African American Man Jaxson Hayes for saying the N word? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
&gt;The LAPD union sent a 4-page letter to Adam Silver and Pelicans owner Gayle Benson urging them to punish Jaxson Hayes for using the N-word  r/nottheonion
Its such a fucking embarrassment comparing Jaxson Hayes saying the N word with what Meyers Leonard did.
Jaxson Hayes is black
"He had one season where he really regressed (and Jaxson Hayes shined) but he was strong last season. Especially late in the season. Especially defensively. But he still lacks an offensive game facing the basket, aside from alley oops and pick-and-rolls. He made strides though. And good coaching could help him develop it more."
"Didi is unproven for sure. But I advise you to reconsider that Jaxson hayes take. He has the potential to be one of the more exciting bigs in the nba in a year or so. I hate telling people to ‚Äúlook at highlights‚Äù because that‚Äôs just cherry picking the players best plays‚Ä¶ but seriously, go look at his highlights."
My man really listed didi louzada and Jaxson Hayes as young talent lmao
And Jaxson Hayes
So what‚Äôs this mean for jaxson hayes future w the team? Hernangomez supplanted him in the rotation under SVG it‚Äôll be interesting to see how the new coach handles that
"From what I remember reading the other day, it was a call they received alleging that Hayes engaged in domestic abuse:  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31912928/los-angeles-police-say-new-orleans-pelicans-center-jaxson-hayes-resisted-arrest-had-subdued-taser"
"I guess it is an aspersion to suggest that you are talking out the side of your face but whatever, prove me wrong.   You are happy to put all of the personal responsibility on the cops here, and none of it on Jaxson Hayes, whose actions instigated all of this. Shame on you."
"You're skipping a part there.  The friend's quote: ""stop, stop get your hands off him now I've seen this whole thing stop.""  Then Hayes gets tased.  ""Noo, noo, what is that? What is that stop, stop.""  ""Bro they just came up to us and walked into here and Jaxson said you can't go inside. They started touching him, he pushed them around and that's when he tackled Jaxson. He just tackled Jaxson out of nowhere. ""  Now the use of pronouns can get  confusing, but it seems clear to me the cops got physical first, Jaxson pushed at least one then got tackled.   The guy seemed confused about the escalation so it seems like the pushing around probably wasn't that intense and neither was the initial cop contact on Jaxson, but we don't see it so who knows.  The guy does not seem to know why the cops were called and from his account neither did Jaxson. Again more may be revealed later."
"No, you assumed the friends telling of the story was true by saying the video showed police brutality, instead of a reasonable response by police which it may have been.   He was resisting arrest, which the video clearly shows, not innocently asking a question.   No, it was fucked up what they did to his friend.  And yeah, that‚Äôs one bottom line - cops need to be held accountable. Another bottom line is that criminals need to be held accountable, and also people who resist arrest need to be held accountable. Jaxson Hayes was clearly in the latter category, and may have been in that first one as well."
Did you watch the video? In case you didn't here's the link. https://www.tmz.com/2021/08/04/jaxson-hayes-arrest-video-shows-new-orleans-pelicans-center-struggling-lapd-investigating-possible-use-excessive-force/  Take off the volume and listen to what Hayes says right before he gets tased.
"Jaxson Hayes only weighs 220 pounds, and once he's on the ground like that, if anything his height/leanness is a disadvantage (someone who's 5'10"" / 220 would be significantly harder to hold down than someone who's 6'11"" / 220)."
For real? That‚Äôs why the cops were there. If you must: https://www.dailynews.com/2021/07/29/nba-player-jaxson-hayes-tased-and-arrested-in-woodland-hills/  If you‚Äôre so concerned with people blindly assuming something based on a narrative then you should be asking people why they‚Äôre assuming this is police brutality because that‚Äôs the blind assumption going on right now.
"you refuse to accept anything from the police department and instead rely on Jaxson Hayes. there has been extremely few cases of police officers committing perjury and being found guilty or even considered likely by outlets such as the NYTimes   the police have given their account     again, why where the police there if the girlfriend didn‚Äôt call them? why were they in his yard?"
Jaxson Hayes is gonna have some misspelling he made in the 4th grade next to his mugshot when the video of the police comes out.
"The body cam footage is released after 45 days.  This one looks bad for Hayes though.    &gt; The arrest came after **law enforcement reportedly responded to a domestic dispute at the home of Hayes's girlfriend. Hayes tried to prevent officers from entering the property**. From there, a physical fight reportedly broke out between Hayes and the officers, leading to his being tased.   &gt;According to TMZ, police had to put out an ""officer needs help"" radio call during the altercation. Hayes was taken to a nearby hospital with minor injuries while a police officer was also treated.   https://www.si.com/nba/2021/08/04/pelicans-jaxson-hayes-tased-arrest-investigation  Wait for more information."

"""Don't taze me, bro"" -Jaxson Hayes"
Go tell that to Jaxson Hayes or Sterling Brown
Hayes was tazed twice after complying with officers. People were clowning Jaxson Hayes and saying all sorts of dumb shit. Never believe anything until more details come out and especially never believe any police report.
https://apnews.com/article/sports-nba-arrests-new-orleans-pelicans-jaxson-hayes-e23c9ec7361beeb5090e0ee1ddd5e27d  This AP article has more details about the initial cause for the confrontation. Police were responding to a domestic violence call. When they went inside to interview the victim they said he tried to get past officers to enter the house.
That's every backup center in the league though.  Jaxson Hayes dropped 18 points on 8/11 shooting with 6 blocks on the old frontcourt.
"Are we sure multiple teams wanted Ball, though? The Ball buzz at the trade deadline was only about the Bulls, and clearly the Bulls were the only ones making a big offer now in free agency. (Pretty clear inference from the deal being done in the first minute of free agency; and probably also why the Pels got so little in the S&amp;T. If other teams were competing for Ball, the Bulls probably have to give up more for him.)  And can I point out that every other move by the Bulls was a grotesque overpay for a mediocre one-dimensional player? They're building around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan as well as Ball - and gave up the farm to do so. There is very little evidence the current Bulls front office knows what they're doing.  Re: the Anthony Davis heist, the Pels still have an age-22 All-Star in Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, Jaxson Hayes, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Didi Louzada, two R1 picks, and two R1 pick swaps from that. They're doing OK there."
"I think we need to understand what happened before this in order to pass judgement on use of force. Why *exactly* were they there? Who called 911, and for what? The phrase ""domestic dispute"" can mean many, many things.  My perception of Jaxson Hayes is that he's not a bad guy, and I don't think we should rush to judgement on either side of a domestic issue, but I also think it's very possible the cops were correct to restrain him in some fashion until it was sorted out. They weren't just there trick-or-treating."
"for a moment I was like "" Kiliian Hayes got arrested wtf?"" it took me some time to realise it was Jaxson Hayes yikes"
Easier rule of thumb:   Always assume cops are lying.   Incidents of police smearing credibility on initial reports just in the nba in the last decade:  Thabo Sefolosha  Sterling brown  Massai Ujiri  Jaxson Hayes   This shit is ridiculous.
"I looked for another article. Police respond to domestic dispute call, victim in house and Hayes keeps trying to go back in.  https://apnews.com/article/sports-nba-arrests-new-orleans-pelicans-jaxson-hayes-e23c9ec7361beeb5090e0ee1ddd5e27d"

You were at a pivotal moment in 2012 when AD fell in your lap. But you didn't do anything with him. The best you got was that sweep against the Blazers. Then you got lucky with another generational talent in Zion and you're ruining him already with the incompetence in the front office. You don't draft a player like Jaxson Hayes when you have Zion. You don't let guys who Zion explicitly wants walk in RFA. You've gone trough this before with AD and you would think the franchise would've learned from that. But letting Lonzo go for essentially nothing is the beginning of the end.
It‚Äôs going to be hilarious watching y‚Äôall scramble to say he wasn‚Äôt that good anyway and you‚Äôre happy he‚Äôs finally gone.  ‚ÄúNow we can focus on the stars who actually want to be here! Like Jaxson Hayes!!1!11‚Äù
"Charlotte looks like a really fun team to follow next year. Now imagine them with Jaxson Hayes. Similarly, LaMelo on the Lob City Clippers would have been so much fun."
The five oldest players in the NBA in Vince Carter's last season:  * Rick Mahorn * Herb Williams * Eddie Johnson * Danny Schayes * Dominique Wilkins  The five youngest players in the NBA in Vince Carter's final season (min. 20 games)  * Zion Williamson * Coby WHite * Kevin Porter Jr * Nassir Little * Jaxson Hayes
That suspect? Jaxson Hayes
Jaxson Hayes gonna beat the case
"Dope: Steph Curry, Luka, Dame, Giannis, Tre Young, Joel Embiid and Jokic  Nope: Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook, Kemba Walker, and Kristaps Porzingis   Hope: Zion, Cade Cunningham, Lamelo Ball, Anthony Edwards, and Bruno Caboclo (forever).   Heroes: Bobby Portis, Derrick Rose, Giannis x2, and Boban Marjanovic  Villains: Patrick Beverly, James Harden x2, Kevin Durant sometimes, and Jaxson Hayes  Current Old Guard: Lebron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Carmelo Anthony, and Chris Paul  These are probably the most mentioned names on this sub and the most talked about players. I'm missing a bunch of stars, but these are the people that seem to garner the most attention. The forewords of each list isn't all encompassing, just a meme. The nope category is filled with all stars and a first ballot hall of famer for example."
Spicy P for Juicy J aka Jaxson Hayes. Who says no?
&gt;jaxson Hayes  Not sure why people downvoted you     Photo of Jaxson with Zion: [https://www.thebirdwrites.com/2019/10/21/18677887/jaxson-hayes-pelicans-zion-williamson-favors-jahlil-lonzo-anthony-davis-towns-comparison-nba-draft](https://www.thebirdwrites.com/2019/10/21/18677887/jaxson-hayes-pelicans-zion-williamson-favors-jahlil-lonzo-anthony-davis-towns-comparison-nba-draft)

"People on reddit be like ""fuck the cops"" but who gives a shit if Jaxson Hayes was actually attacking an innocent individual in his house."
Fuck Jaxson Hayes knew he was a weirdo after he freaked out about the rising stars game.
Yeah to the George Floyd case. This is about Jaxson Hayes.
You seen jaxson Hayes? Dude looks more white than black
"Watch this pick be the next Giannis lol, Jaxson Hayes will be known forever as the dude who the Pelicans sold the GOAT to bail out"
That also isn't want Hayes did?  Pretty much every player in the league has lost it on a ref after a call. I'm guessing several have told them to suck their dick.  The Jaxson video is a slightly blown up version or that.   That reaction has no relation to allegedly beating your girlfriend or fighting cops for no reason.
I‚Äôve always said the NBA bigwigs have an anti Jaxson Hayes agenda
Bruh buggin lmao. Yeah its politics that jaxson freaking hayes didnt get selected lmao. They had it out for him
-Headline clearly says Jaxson Hayes  -Redditor still makes the low effort Sideshow Bob joke  -Other Redditors still upvote and give awards smh
Why didn‚Äôt Jaxson Hayes just spread his cheeks and lift his sack?
"I often wonder how they'd look if they'd even taken PJ Washington instead of Jaxson Hayes. A 3-5 of Ingram, Zion and Washington could work very well."
Should slam them back for calling Jaxson Hayes an ‚ÄúNBA Star‚Äù
"What self-awareness do I lack? You said Jaxson Hayes has a shaky outside shot. The facts say you're wrong.  Of course, Hayes might also be the best roll-man/rim-runner/finisher in the league, which is why the Pels mostly want him playing around the basket, not shooting threes.  That prowess around the basket, by the way, is why Hayes's career true-shooting percentage is almost a hundred points higher than Joel Embiid's."
Embiid is the only player on Philadelphia I would trade Jaxson Hayes for. Remember this three years from now when Hayes makes the All-Star team. BTW Hayes is a career 38.9% shooter from deep.
"Broooooo I got drafted to the Pelicans, I can‚Äôt lie I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre having fun with our young pieces and that‚Äôs exactly how they gonna play this season! Lemme tell you though Jaxson Hayes is a Kawhi Stopper, man literally held him to 2-18 inna game"
"Pg: Joker  SG: embiid  SF: Nurkic  PF: Bam  C: Porzingis  Bench: Capela, Jarret Allen, Mo bamba, Plumlee, Jaxson Hayes"
Jaxson hayes
Jaxson Hayes might end up on this list someday. I hope he sees this and stays off the headlines  for the wrong reasons.
"RJ was the 3rd pick in the draft who played at Duke and is know playing for the Knicks. And I‚Äôm not saying people don‚Äôt know who they are, they just don‚Äôt know how good they are because they only watched a couple games early in the season.   And it wouldn‚Äôt be like me comparing them to you saying Frank and Knox are underrated because I‚Äôm not lying. I could bring up stats that backup NAW and Jaxson Hayes being good, but I don‚Äôt feel like it and you probably don‚Äôt care.  A good number of people know about NAW now thanks to team Canada, but not a lot of national media."
"This is just Jaxson Hayes shit again. People are all assuming the story they want it to before we really know anything. Let it play out, folks."
I thought Jaxson Hayes was good but I‚Äôm also a Texas fan and am biased
"Solid list, sneaky pick, Rajon Rondo and apparently Jaxson Hayes"

Jaxson Hayes. I swear every game this kid tries to commit murder and I hope one day he succeeds. Very fun player to watch and has some solid potential. Can‚Äôt wait for him to develop into a solid player and then get traded to a contender like every good player the pelicans have ever had.
These nba kids have serious ego issues look at jaxson hayes lol
"If the Pelicans only got rid of Eric Bledsoe they'd win this easily. They also made a much needed upgrade at center with Jonas Valanciunas over Steven Adams. Have 6 different young players who will show growth in Zion, BI, Jaxson Hayes, NAW, Kira, and Naji Marshall and drafted players who can play d and showed out in summer league Trey Murphy (all summer league) and Herb Jones. Also Murphy looks like a sniper which is much needed."
"Jaxson Hayes, he‚Äôs got to be a top five bounciest center in the nba at least. Dude‚Äôs incredibly fun to watch and may surprise some people in the next few seasons."
Jaxson Hayes and Sekou
"IMO Jaxson Hayes has as much physical talent as anyone in the NBA, and a healthy quantity of basketball skill. His hands are incredible, he can catch anything. He's a good passer with good court vision, and he has a good shooting stroke. He's still a little jumpy on defense, but he is not afraid of contact\*, and he might lead the league in blocks someday.  He won't win MVP, Zion will always be the alpha on the Pelicans. But in five years I think he could be the best center in the league. Check out his career NET RTG:   OFF 131  DEF 112  Defense obviously needs work ‚Äì but look at that Off Rtg! And those are for his ages 19‚Äì20 seasons. What will he do in his prime?  The sky's the limit for Jaxson Hayes.  \*just ask the LAPD (too soon?)"
"Alright let's break down your comment and see how I'm supposed to interpret this  &gt;i still don't get how you need to tase someone who's already in cuffs with 3 people on top of him. our countries cops are so shit    ""You need to tase someone, who's already in cuffs(not true), with 3 people on top of him(3 people trying to control him, and he's still resisting).  Our countries cops are shit""  How many of you(read as: How many Fyne_s) would it take to control Jaxson Hayes if he was resisting?  And how big are you?  You gonna go sign up for the police force?"
"Come on now.  I don't know what you expect from an average cop, but Jaxson isn't an average guy. You'd need to be a highly trained martial artist to take him down 1-1, and even in that scenario it would be preferable to be over 6 feet and 200 pounds. A larger than average person.  Those people are rare, and a lot of them can make more money doing something other than the thankless job that is policing, where they are tasked with bringing down monster idiots like Jaxson Hayes when he is throwing a booze filled tantrum in return for a meagre salary and the prize of being completely shit on by the community.  Who could blame them."
"i‚Äôm pretty sure sterling brown was in a parking lot, Pero Antic  Cope and Thabo was at a nightclub   Hayes was at a really nice house in a rich part of town and the girls friend called 911 and said she was with jaxson hayes  plus Antic lost his case lol"
"When this incident first happened, a bunch of people in the comments section said ""it's unnecessary force, and of course they haven't released the body cam footage cause it will make the cops look even worse.""  Now that the body-cam footage has come out and it's clear that the force wasn't unnecessary, there are a bunch of people saying ""well the cops didn't communicate well enough to deescalate the situation.""  These types of comments that put zero personal responsibility on Jaxson Hayes and all of it on the police are maddening. Not gonna help make anything better."
"Police should‚Äôve done much better to deescalate this, but Jaxson Hayes was acting like such a dumbass. And considering he was most likely the perceived threat, and the reason the cops were called and can enter without a warrant, that doesn‚Äôt particularly absolve him of the police not communicating the situation very well."
Jaxson ClownFace Hayes
It also made the cops look like clowns when LAPD asked Adam Silver to suspend Jaxson Hayes for saying the n-word
Jaxson Hayes is dumb as fuck.
" &gt;* Hayes continues to not cooperate and refuses to let them in. Continues to approach the officers multiple times even though they tell him to stay back. * They go to arrest him and he slams one officer into the wall. Leading to a struggle on the ground. The officer says multiple times ‚ÄúPlease stop I‚Äôm going to tase you. Please stop.‚Äù  That's pretty biased recap of the events. How about the fact Jaxson's friend is holding back Jaxson and the cops tell him to back up and away? Or the fact that immediately after that they go to handcuff a non-violent Jaxson who is calmly walking without warning? How about putting a knee on his neck and suffocating him? How about tasing him while 3 cops are on him and he is asking for a badge number? The whole time the officer telling him to stop resisting, Jaxson literally cannot breathe and has multiple people on him."
"The 2nd angle shows 3 different cops had their hands on Jaxson before they say you are being detained. It does show the officer going backwards into the wall before Hayes, but that doesn't mean Hayes wasnt grabbed, pushed, or pulled."
Zion  BI  NAW  Trey Murphy  Jaxson Hayes
"for what it's worth, having Adams on the team seems to have really helped Jaxson Hayes so I'm sure it could do similar things for Mobley"
"Jaxson Hayes and NAW still leaves off Didi, Herb Jones, and whoever we pick with Cleveland‚Äôs 2nd next year. We essentially got 2 firsts and 3 seconds for 4."
Jaxson Hayes and NAW* Jaxson improved a lot last year and is going to be our backup 5. He also was knocking down threes towards the end of last year so he has the potential to provide that spacing that so many of you like to make fun of us for lacking.  NAW was starting to play very well in the second half of last year and showed great chemistry with Zion. He is probably going to start at the 2 for us this year
"Small market teams whine and complain instead of actually doing their homework when drafting. OKC, Suns, and even the Warriors (who nobody wanted to go to for the longest time) became relevant through good drafting. We give the Pelican fans another top 5 pick in the draft and then they go and turn it into Jaxson Hayes lmao"
Jaxson Hayes. He‚Äôs so good.
"I mean Stan also basically insisted on playing multiple bigs together. Like when Zion went out he started Jaxson Hayes at the 4 alongside Steve Adams. I know the roster was limited, but still. There was a game in Philly where he went to a lineup with Zion, James Johnson, Willy Hernangomez, AND Steve Adams.  That all being said, I don‚Äôt think most of the failing were schematic."
Jaxson Hayes just seems like a douchebag to me ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I thought Jaxson Hayes was a great pick at the time
Fun fact: New Orleans had that #4 pick from the Lakers and decided to trade down for Jaxson Hayes and NAW.
"Likely matchup related (Jaxson Hayes is super limited offensively), but his D looked solid tonight.  Had two very nice lob deflections after showing on the pick and roll.    That said, he's a solid backup, but I'm not expecting him to win any games for us.  His offense is hot garbage and he's a turnover machine."
"I'm just confused cause they wasted the 8th pick in the 2019 draft on Jaxson Hayes, and then extend Valanciunas instead of trying to give Hayes more minutes and trying to develop him?"
Jaxson Hayes would like a word
Jaxson Hayes does.
1. demar derozan 2. mike conley 3. tyler johnson 3. jared dudley 3. darius garland 3. brad wanamaker 2. eric gordon 3. dorian finney smith 3. evan fournier 4. jaxson hayes
"Before this offseason I‚Äôd agree with you, but the organisation has made some extremely questionable moves since the lottery balls rolled their way in 2019.  They let Lonzo walk as a RFA for no reason whatsoever. They made his replacement a guy who has never shot above 39% from the field in his NBA career and a massive downgrade on defense. Overall they paid more draft compensation in the two deals than they received while simultaneously receiving the worse bundle of players both now and five years in the future.  My grievances with this team don‚Äôt stop there. They traded for a non-shooting big in Steven Adams knowing full well that their star‚Äôs main offensive weakness is perimeter shooting. They gave up George Hill, a first and two seconds in that deal. They gave up *Jrue Holiday* of all people for Eric Bledsoe, Hill, and a bunch of picks. They had the option of taking De‚ÄôAndre Hunter and instead flipped him for Jaxson Hayes (again, not a bad player at all, but still a non-shooting big next to a guy who attempted 14 threes his whole rookie season) and some guys who immediately got flipped for seconds. As an OKC fan, I know all too well the importance of hoarding draft picks as a bad team, but *the Pelicans were not a bad team*. They finished 4 games out of the play-in spot in the bubble, were only 2 games out last year, and I guarantee that their 23rd-ranked defense would‚Äôve improved if they had someone who made the All-Defensive 1st Team playing next to another All-Defense caliber guy in Lonzo in the backcourt, possibly enough to even lift them out of the play-in group. Long story short, the Pelicans have had plenty of chances to make the playoffs since Zion landed in NOLA, and they have capitalised on almost none of those opportunities.  To be clear, **I don‚Äôt believe Zion is nearly as unhappy as the media make him out to be in New Orleans, but there are certainly lots of reasons why he wouldn‚Äôt be totally happy with the team that drafted him**."
Jaxson Hayes?
"I can‚Äôt argue with the first 3 points (I don‚Äôt mind losing lonzo but we should‚Äôve got a better return) but I disagree with the 4th. First of all the Jrue picks haven‚Äôt had the chance to materialise yet, and in time we can use them on players or ideally package them with our remaining picks and some lakers ones for a 3rd star. Then there‚Äôs Hayes, NAW and Didi. Both Jaxson and Nickeil have showed good progress at the end of last year and have a lot of promise as players. I believe both will be more important to us than josh hart this year"
"Nickeil Alexander-Walker &gt; De'Andre Hunter  Jaxson Hayes &gt; De'Andre Hunter  So, yes.  In that deal Pels also got multiple second-round picks and major salary relief.  BTW, Nickeil Alexander-Walker &gt; Lonzo Ball"
Give Jaxson Hayes 30mins like Hunter had he will be decent
Jaxson Hayes is still in the league? I thought the whole resisting arrest / domestic violence thing was going to be a bigger deal but I guess not
"Man, I hope Jaxson Hayes is ok. Was looking like a critical piece for our team this year.   Made huge strides on defense last season and was beginning to show flashes of a perimeter game. Even beat reporters were saying he had a smooth 3 point shot. Just a terrible loss for the team if he is gone."
"The Pelicans could run out two intriguing units:  SPEED: Kira Lewis/Devonte' Graham/Nickeil Alexander-Walker/Ingram/Zion  JUMBO: Ingram/Trey Murphy/Zion/Jaxson Hayes/Jonas Valanciunas  Each of those units are plausible 1‚Äì2‚Äì3‚Äì4‚Äì5, at least in short bursts. Neither would be used for long, if at all.  But they would be fun to see. The first could run circles around you, and the second could run you over."
2016: Denzel Valentine to Juancho Hernangomez  2017: Lauri Markkanen to Frank Ntilikina  2018: Wendell Carter Jr to Collin Sexton  2019: Coby White to Jaxson Hayes  2020: Patrick Williams to Isaac Okoro.
jaxson hayes
We will trade him for Jaxson Hayes
At this point literally none. Got Clint for dirt cheap. Paid a good bit for Hunter but he‚Äôs good (except injuries :( ). For context he was traded for the picks that became NAW and Jaxson Hayes.    Obviously ppl will say ‚Äúoh but what about Luka ü§ì ‚Äú nah no regrets with that trade. We can talk about hypotheticals all we want but the FACT is Trae has led his team further and we got a promising young wing jn Cam.
"Jaxson Hayes yelled, ‚ÄúThere he goes!‚Äù Jonas Valanciunas gave a look of horrified surprise. Brandon Ingram belted, ‚ÄúWe got a fucking unit now.‚Äù And before Zion Williamson got stuck trying to enter the locker room door, ex-NBA player, now coach, Willie Green hugged him &amp; said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall look so fat.‚Äù"
"Except I don't recall the Knicks ever ""exploiting"" Trae on defense, only moments i can recall is hitting Kanter on the catch and shoot a couple times but that was about it. It was an altogether ugly game after about late in the 2nd quarter. Really, Reggie is excellent for matching up against guys like Bogi and Cam but they both went out early.   It was just an ugly, weird game. Nobody but Burks and Trae got anything going. Kudos to your young guy Sims though, dude's a beast. Reminds me of Jaxson Hayes, but bigger. He can jump out of the gym."

"The score for this game looks better than the game actually was. Pelicans were ice cold from beyond the arc‚Ä¶ except for Jaxson Hayes?       Anyway, Green should be making sure that everybody gets at least spot minutes. The odds that 12 guys are all ice cold are a lot smaller than 8 or 9 guys.        Happy with a split overall. This has all the hallmarks of a statistical anomaly."
Started the game 0-21 on 3‚Äôs  Jaxson Hayes was the Pelicans leading scorer and didn‚Äôt play until well into the 4th quarter
so jaxson hayes is trash ?
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
"Keep benching Jaxson Hayes, Billy is better"
Sign and trade with the Pels.  We even have Jaxson Hayes so they trade for another center.

"Jaxson Hayes would be really nice, apparently the Pistons are in discussion with the kings for Marvin Bagley as well"
Thanks for the answer it's wild how he can be dominant in college and useless in the NBA because of his physical limitations. Feel like Jaxson Hayes would be good for you guys for now hes rotting in NO
"Obviously they have some assets. But it really is a fraction of what he inherited.   - Zion's value rounds to zero, compared to what it was when Griffin started.  - Ingram on a max is barely a positive asset, if at all - Gave up a 1st round picks for Steven Adams - Gave up a 1st round pick to get rid of Steven Adams - Gave up a 1st round pick to downgrade Lonzo into Graham - #4 Lakers pick turned into Jaxson Hayes and NAW - rounds down to zero"
"Out of curiosity, I wanted to see exactly what return the Pels got in return, so I tried to follow the trades:  - **CP3**: Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, al-Farouq Aminu, 2012 Pick (Austin Rivers). Of these players, none re-signed with the Pels. Rivers was later traded along with Russ Smith for Quincy Pondexter (did not play for NOLA, due to injury) and a 2015 2nd (pick 56, Branden Dawson, traded to LAC for $$$). - **Anthony Davis**: Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, the 4th overall pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), a 2021 protected first-round pick (did not convert), the right to swap 2023 first-round picks, a 2024 first-round pick, and cash    - **Ball** was sign-and-traded for Garrett Temple, Tomas Satoransky, a 2024 2nd, and cash.   - NOLA would flip the 4th pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), for pick 8 (Jaxson Hayes), pick 17 (Nickeil Alexander-Walker) pick 35 (Didi Louzada) - as well as a protected 2020 pick, which did not appear to convert.  - Christian Wood was waived.  - **Jrue Holiday**: Return was Eric Bledsoe, 2025 &amp; 2027 first round picks, 2024 &amp; 2026 pick swap rights.  - Eric Bledsoe was later traded alongside Steven Adams, Ziaire Williams &amp; rights to Jared Butler in exchange for: Jonas Valanƒçi≈´nas, and rights to Trey Murphy &amp; Brandon Boston.   - Brandon Boston would later be moved to the Clippers in exchange for Sacramento's 2022 second round pick (protected).   So in exchange for ""this crop"" the Pels got:    - Brandon Ingram - Garrett Temple - Tomas Satoransky - Jaxon Hayes - Nickeil Alexander-Walker - Didi Louzada - Jonas Valanƒçi≈´nas - Trey Murphy  Draft picks picks picks:    - **From the AD trade**: LAL's 2024 first rounder, and right to swap 2023 first rounders. - **From the Jrue Holiday trade**: Milwaukee's 2025 &amp; 2027 firsts, right to swap 2024 &amp; 2026 firsts with Milwaukee, Sacramento's 2022 2nd round pick (protected). - **From the Lonzo Ball trade**: Chicago's 2024 2nd  Out of these, Ingram and Valanƒçi≈´nas stand out, obviously - but Alexander-Walker is alright, and man that's a lot of firsts."
"Even apart from zion and ingram being out, they have premium level prospects on their roster that should be developing and performing better.  Guys like kira lewis and NAW and jaxson hayes have talent and potential.   They were high-to-mid first round draft picks  Also their defense is just ass, they look like they have no idea where they should be standing or who they should be guarding.  I put that on the coach primarily because with their athleticism and length they should be performing better  A veteran coach would get better production out of them and put them in a defensive system that covers their inexperience"
I forgot Jaxson Hayes was in the NBA still lol
"McGee, Chris Paul and Jaxson Hayes were amazing for the Suns"
"I think the SVG hiring was a bad move and the roster construction is very poor. Zion today had 14 in the first quarter when no one on the pels could make a shot to save their lives. He drew 6 fouls in that time as well. Then for the next 2 quarters he has 2FGA. It's absolutely absurd. Then they start giving him the ball in the 4th and pels cut our lead from 17 to 2 with the help of Jaxson Hayes and josh hart.    If he has the right team around him, he can be easily be a 28/10 guy given his efficiency. Defensively he's often caught ball watching but he's hasn't even completed a full regular season yet. I think under a competent coach and on a roster built to neutralize his weaknesses, I would pick zion.   Nothing against Tatum but I believe Zion has the potential to become a superstar"
Jaxson Hayes had his way with us in the second half.
Jaxson Hayes
"I was wondering why Jaxson Hayes was closing over him, this explains it I guess"
Jaxson Hayes &gt; Steve Adams
JAXSON HAYES RISING STAR
Jaxson Hayes in shambles
I‚Äôm not going to argue with you about this but Nicolo Melli and Jaxson Hayes are not better defenders than Lonzo Ball and Josh Hart...
&gt; Jaxson Hayes  how has he been?
Remember when we memed Jaxson Hayes last year for caring about rising star snubs
Jaxson Hayes does
Jaxson Hayes snubbed yet again
"I would keep Zion, BI, Zo, Hart, and Jaxson Hayes for his potential but all the vets are on the table to leave"
Imagine if Jaxson Hayes made another video complaining about being snubbed for this two years in a row üòÇ
Overrated: Redick? He‚Äôs washed now. Wasn‚Äôt many options for this. Maybe Jaxson Hayes but most Pels fans knows he‚Äôs bad.   Underrated: Lonzo or Zion
Man is Jaxson Hayes really that bad or is it through homer hate?
"He‚Äôs the worst player in basketball.  actually, that‚Äôs a bit too far, Jaxson Hayes is in the NBA. 2nd worst"
"If I had to redraft the top 10 it would actually be pretty close to the initial selections:  1. Zion Williamson (#1) 2. Ja Morant (#2) 3. RJ Barrett (#3) 4. DeAndre Hunter (#4) 5. Coby White (#7) 6. Rui Hachimura (#9) 7. Tyler Herro (#13) 8. Matisse Thybulle (#20) 8. Lugentz Dort (undrafted) 9. Keldon Johnson (#29)   Other players that outperformed their picks include Brandon Clarke (#21), Grant Williams (#22) and Kendrick Nunn (undrafted).  Players that dropped out of my top 10: Darius Garland, Jaxson Hayes, Cam Reddish, but all of them would probably be in the 11-20 range"
What‚Äôs the deal with Jaxson Hayes? Is he a bust?  Dude went 8th overall and currently does nothing.
I have one Jaxson Hayes and Eric Bledsoe offer here
Lonzo Ball/NAW  PJ Tucker/Josh  Hart  Brandon Ingram/PJ Tucker  Zion Williamson/PJ Tucker  PJ Tucker/Jaxson Hayes
"Jaxson Hayes has no idea how to actually play basketball, all he can do is block shots"
"Nobody that moves the needle much. Some names ive though of are Mo Bamba, Jaxson Hayes and Zubac"
"Have you seen Jaxson Hayes? Same team, much worse defender than Zion."
Jaxson Hayes the bitch
Jaxson Hayes. Disgustingly bad. Can jump high and yells. He‚Äôs terrible. Awful. Shit. Fundamentals of a middle-schooler. Bad attitude.
Jaxson Hayes might be the lowest iq player in the league
This dude is so much better than Jaxson Hayes
Reminder the pelicans passed on him for Jaxson Hayes and now run a Bledsoe/ Lonzo lineup. Zion and cam reunion would‚Äôve been fun
"He did an abysmal job during Lebron's last seasons, trading for Korver was bad when they needed defense, the Kyrie trade was a disaster, the Clarkson/Nance/Hill/Hood trade was a failure besides Hill none of them produced in the playoffs.  He did a nice job in the AD trade, but the Jaxson Hayes pick was an absolute horrendous draft, the whole Adams thing, retainig Bledsoe instead of George Hill who fitted better...  that's a lof of bad stuff"
I think I like more minutes for Jaxson Hayes or even Hernangomez.
He saw what politics did to Jaxson Hayes and is sweating
We had 1st and 4th last year but we traded 4th (DeAndre Hunter) for 8th (Jaxson Hayes) and 17th (Nickeil Alexander-Walker).
"Look I'm a ""basketball nerd"" and even I would find it kind of tedious if they forced X's and O's talk into every play. Ppl complain about guys like JVG and Mark Jackson not talking about the game but I hear them speak tactics all the time, its probably just flying over ppls heads because they just say it casually.  ""Player X needs to do a better job staying attached to the body of Redick. Coming off these handoffs theres too much daylight.""  ""Yeah and Player Y guarding Jaxson Hayes is way back because he's a non-shooter, so when he hands it off to Redick, Y is not ip at the line to contest.""  Yall just like to complain to complain lol. But yeah there are some lackluster commentators like C Webb and Reggie Miller part of what makes them so damn annoying is that they try to analyze the game and its just garbage. Trying to make mundane plays sound profound or getting all goofy over a highlight."
Jaxson Hayes
"sure, but let's not simply assume 20 yr old, 7' 230lb jaxson hayes literally did nothing but stand there with his hands up while two cops tackled and tased him. i don't see any reason not to believe jaxson was combative. i'm never surprised if cops use too much force, or their telling of an incident is exaggerated or inaccurate, but i also would be anything but surprised if a strong, giant, probably overconfident/slightly cocky 20 yr old millionaire (do we know if he was sober?) wasn't perfectly cooperative with police. especially if he was potentially trying to hide some sort of domestic abuse."
"""what are you gonna do, tase me?"" -Jaxson Hayes"
Jaxson Hayes is such a dumbass lol
Considering Jaxson Hayes is 6‚Äô11 220 I doubt it was an ass kicking
Didn't know Jaxson Hayes was a 13 y.o. girl with a broken heart.
Pelicans Jaxson Hayes is a helluva name
"&gt;who in the nba is politically against jaxson hayes making the rising stars game  ""But Marge, I was a political prisoner!""  ""How are you a political prisoner?""  ""I kicked a giant mouse in the butt! Do I have to draw you a diagram?"""
Just sprinkle some crack on Jaxson Hayes and lets get out of here!
I like how Jaxson Hayes acted like a violent degenerate and hospitalized a dude and r/NephewBitchAssery is STILL finding a way to whine about cops. Never change dumbasses
"Statement from Jaxson Hayes: ""The NBA can really suck my dick for all I care"""
wtf Iove jaxson hayes now
"No, it says so in the very first paragraph of the literal fucking text  &gt;New Orleans Pelicans center Jaxson Hayes -- the #8 overall pick in the 2019 NBA Draft -- was arrested after an alleged violent altercation with police, TMZ Sports has learned ... **and it apparently got so extreme, the hooper and a cop were taken to a hospital.**"
Oh yeah I guess he just sought treatment in the back of the cop car? Where do people that seek medical treatment go?  https://www.complex.com/sports/pelicans-jaxson-hayes-arrested-hospitalized-altercation-with-cops/  If you still don‚Äôt believe me here‚Äôs another article reporting the cop was hospitalized
this is still the most randomly funny shit to come out the past few years  like who in the nba is politically against jaxson hayes making the rising stars game of all fucking things
"Jaxson Hayes be like ""The LAPD can suck mah dick."""
"Good point. But ‚ÄòJaxson ‚ÄúNBA can suck my d**k‚Äù Hayes‚Äô doesn‚Äôt seem to appreciate or value being in the league anyway, so it‚Äôs no real loss for him"
Jaxson Hayes reminds me of Marquess Chriss young athletic as fuck but dumb as bricks.
Jaxson Hayes is voiced by Kelsey Grammer?
How about Dwight Powell to replace Jaxson Hayes after his new felony charge lol?
[TMZ Article](https://amp.tmz.com/2021/07/28/nba-jaxson-hayes-arrested-hospitalized-alleged-violent-incident/?__twitter_impression=true)  This doesn't sound good with an incoming felony charge. Hope there's body cam footage
"Obi Toppin, Jaxson Hayes, Collin Sexton, Frank Ntilikina, Marquese Chriss, Stanley Johnson, Nik Stauskas, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Terrence Ross, Brandon Knight...  Yeah, out of the last 10 Sexton is almost the only one who's turned into a really good player. Ross and KCP are tidy, but nothing special."
"Jaxson Hayes exists too - had a decent year and still young.  Could have 3 guys drafted this year too, Kai Jones, Jericho Sims, and Greg Brown"
Best case scenario is JV fills our offensive needs this year and Jaxson Hayes continues to develop into a starter for the 22-23 season.
"Well, we're trying with Jaxson Hayes."
Just motivation and mentoring for Jaxson Hayes who has all the physical tools but hasn't matured/progressed as quickly as the Pel's would like.
The center they need is jaxson Hayes after another year imo
Jaxson Hayes showed remarkable improvement throughout the season and credited his improvement to sticking to Adams after he was benched.
Jaxson Hayes has shot 0.1 threes per game on average over 2 seasons...
"Pels would have Zion, NAW, Jaxson Hayes and Reddish all come up for extensions at the same time. I don‚Äôt think the Pels with go after Cam for that reason."
I don't want to give up assets for that. Jaxson Hayes should be able to hit that number.
Jaxson Hayes and NAW
I mean Embiid has been playing basketball for what? 7 years or something   Jaxson Hayes also hasnt been playing longer than like 4 years so
"Eric Bledsoe, Jaxson Hayes, Kira Lewis Jr. and three first-round picks for Ben Simmons. Wasn't sure about Kira Lewis Jr. but needed to make salaries work.  Pelicans manage to offload Bledsoe, and gain an all-star PG. They also sink further into roster construction hell and lose assets needed to build a team around Zion.  76ers get rid of Simmons but also receive a downgrade at the PG position, their new back-up C for when Embiid misses 20 games is an even greater downgrade than before, and either have to spend the picks to find a favourable trade from Bledsoe, or spend a year with a worse PG than the one they just traded away."
"10 . New Orleans Pelicans Josh Giddey | 6-8 wing | 18 years old | Adelaide The player: Giddey had a terrific season in Australia, averaging 11 points, seven rebounds and seven assists, leading the league in helpers and finishing sixth in rebounding as an 18-year-old. He needs to tighten up his handle a bit and keep improving as a shooter, but the skill set here is perfect for that of a secondary playmaker at the next level due to how quickly he processes the game. Giddey should be a very high-level role player who starts, with some upside for more if the jumper gets figured out.  The fit: I have less of a feel for the Pelicans than any other team in the top 10. They have a tendency to draft younger (Kira Lewis, Zion Williamson and Jaxson Hayes were all teenagers when they were picked, and Nickeil Alexander-Walker was 20 years old) under this regime. Plus, their backcourt of the future could use a bit more size. I‚Äôve gone Giddey here, who would be a pretty great replacement for Lonzo Ball, given that Ball is a free agent and no guarantee to re-sign in New Orleans. One other note on Giddey: he has a lot of fans in ranges of the draft that aren‚Äôt his projected range, including Toronto ‚Äî one of the few teams to send personnel to see him live this year in Australia. Don‚Äôt be surprised to see a team target him in a trade situation."
"I'm drafting top 10 in a deep draft. It's not like I don't have a draft pick and have to go searching for veterans as my only option.    I have Zion who's 21 and can create his own shot. Brandon Ingram who's 23 and can create his own shot. NAW who is getting better and better as a combo guard with starting or 6th man potential who can also get his own shot and is 22. Already have a future big in Jaxson Hayes. Also have Lonzo and Josh Hart who are RFAs we can resign. I have no need to draft a guy with a high potential like a Moses Moody or a Keon Johnson or someone one &amp; done that will sit on the bench because he can't utilize a discernible skill right away to get on the court next to Zion or BI or over Hart/NAW/Hayes/Zo.   I'm drafting the highest star role player type I can get. Someone who knows they are a compliment piece to Zion/BI. Someone who's gonna play hard offensively and defensively. Someone who has a discernible skill like shooting or defense to get on the court as soon as possible. If that's Kispert, I go for it. Might be Trey Murphy, might be Franz Wagner.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Why are you banking on a rookie being a quality role player?  I'm banking on Kispert to be a quality role player because he's shown 4 years of shooting 40.8% from 3 and the last two being 43.8% and 44% with 5.4 and 6.5 attempts per game. These are going to translate into the NBA right away unless he goes Markelle Fultz on us.   He's been asked to play his role in the NBA for 4 years at Gonzaga already. Court is getting bigger, defense is getting lazier in the regular season, pace is getting faster (not that Gonzaga wasn't already fast af), shooting is a bigger emphasize compared to college.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt; Build the rest of the roster with vets who have proven they can play in those spots.  Sure you can ALSO do that but I still have a draft pick in the top 10 now. I'll only trade that for Dame or another star player like Bradley Beal.   Phoenix did this same idea with Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson when ""draft experts"" thought there were better players available still. But they ended up getting their guys they wanted to build around Booker and Ayton. Atlanta as well with building around Trae Young with Hunter, Reddish, Huerter, and then went to spend money on Bogdanovic and somewhat overspent on Gallo.   There's no problem with spending on vets. But I still have to utilize this pick for my roster somehow.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;There‚Äôs already been reports about Zion‚Äôs family not wanting him outta New Orleans. If those are true, then next year has to be the year Zion and his team see some kind of progression within the organization.   Relax those are bluffs. He's literally 21. The probably with the Pelicans isn't the teams talent on the floor but more with ownership and market size. If he wants out after his rookie contract so be it. I think the last time someone led their team to a championship on a rookie contract was Tim Duncan. These things take time to build.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Why would you give 23 mins a game to someone like Kispert when you can just Inquire about an Eric Gordon type to play the same role but better?  Because I have a draft pick and need to use it and should get someone to fit into the roster I have already constructed. Everyone is young still. I can go get vets but I still need to draft a player baring a superstar trade like Dame or Beal."
