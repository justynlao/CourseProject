"If he has already finished puberty I would be absolutely shocked if he becomes anything more then just a piece a team adds with the hope that Lebron joins them too.   He is 6’2 with limited skills and terrible shooting. Not a PG.   Compare him to someone like DeJon Jarreau, Kerwin Roach, Rasheed Sulaimon and Solomon Poole and he is well behind them in terms of talent and pro potential.   Comparing him to someone like Lou Williams, Monta Ellis and even Malik Newman and he is miles behind them.   With that said, if he hits a 3-4” growth (unlikely as he hasn’t seemed to grow much the last 2 years) he could definitely be an NBA player he lives in the gym. If your 6’5-6’6 and a good athlete (he is) with a knockdown shot you’ll get a decent chance.   Definitely has the athleticism to compete at the nba level, just not the skills nor the IQ.   Excited to see what happens with his development these next 2-3 years"
Malcolm Brogdon  Chris Duarte  Justin Holiday  Domantas Sabonis  Myles Turner  T.J. McConnell  Goga Bitadze  Oshae Brissett  Jeremy Lamb  Torrey Craig  Isaiah Jackson  Brad Wanamaker  Caris LeVert  DeJon Jarreau  T.J. Warren
I wonder if there are guys in college/GLeague right now who could fit into their mold. Maybe Dejon Jarreau in 3-4 years?
