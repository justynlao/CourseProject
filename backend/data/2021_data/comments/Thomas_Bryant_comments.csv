What about Thomas Bryant?
"&gt; fired one of the worst GMs in NBA history less than two years ago  And who did they hire my dear friend? Surely not the worst gm in nba history’s long time understudy and assistant, right? I saw wiz fans saying how great shepherd is all offseason and look at where the team is at despite having prime beal. There is absolutely no path for them to construct a winner around beal in the next 3-5 years. They need a whole new team around him at every position. Maybe 1 or 2 of the young guys become good contributors. But as it stands there’s literally nothing on that roster that gives me any reason to think the wizards can even construct a playoff team, let alone a contender.   Wiz fans are pretty delusional in evaluating shepherd tbh. Last season if you read a wiz fans comment on here about Thomas Bryant you would think the guy is young AD and not the worst rim protecting starting center in the league. Rui and deni are the only semi interesting assets on the roster."
Idk Thomas Bryant posterizing someone on our own basket was up there
Thomas Bryant was shooting 43% from three before he tore his ACL
Thomas Bryant
Yeah you disrespectful by lumping in Thomas Bryant with them lmao he's solid
"&gt; Powell might as well be the worst starting C in the league.  Nope. WCJ, DJ, Baynes, Thomas Bryant and Naz Reid if you count him are all clearly worse and then there's several debatable players in the same tier i.e. Zeller/Plumlee/Theis/Bagley/Gasol/Looney/Aldridge which is like half the non-star starting Cs in the league.  &gt; Dfs would be a bench player on most teams.  On most contenders maybe, and Dallas isn't one."
"I have watched a few of their games to figure that out myself. Their defence is their biggest issue. As Beal said they can't guard a parked car. Despite having Beal score these insane numbers, they give up so many points to their opponent that it doesn't make much of a difference. They need better rim protection, Lopez isn't it. Their starting centre Thomas Bryant has a season ending ACL tear. This should also give you more insight, Westbrook scored 163 points on 163 shots (before yesterday's game). They had a 2 week break because of covid and had to shut their facility down. The coach is already subpar, and he admitting his coaching has been off because of covid. Today was their first practice with more than 8 players available.   So basically bad defence, Westbrook hasn't been helpful, injuries and covid is why."
"Wizards are completely broken. The second they lost Thomas Bryant, the season was over. C19 protocols were the nail in the coffin but this team doesn't have any above the rim or defensive threats to extend opposing teams or put them in foul trouble."
"russ hasn’t been good the first 9 games. he was better va the hawks.  the lack of team success is on scott brooks and injuries imo. russ has been injured, we lost thomas bryant, and scott brooks is the worst coach in the league.   i think it’s to early to say it’s fully in WB (he’s only played 10 games) but he hasn’t been great so far."
"Strange to think how that team sucked 3 years ago, but you could argue that starting lineup this year would be one of the more well-rounded in the league.   Ingram has become an all-star level scorer, Randle is currently top 10 in points/assists/rebounds and will likely be an all-star, Zo is a solid pure PG with shooting streaks and good defense, Lopez is a major piece to a perennial contender and same with KCP.  Caruso, Clarkson, Kuzma, Nance, Hart, and Thomas Bryant as well.  Crazy the difference a couple of years can make"
"I mean let's count it up:      2020- LeBron James   2019- Kawhi Leonard   2018- Kevin Durant   2017- Kevin Durant   2016- LeBron James   2015- Steph Curry   2014- Tim Duncan   2013- LeBron James   2012- LeBron James   2011- Dirk Nowitzki   2010- Kobe Bryant   2009- Kobe Bryant   2008- Honestly no idea, probably Kevin Garnett   2007- Tim Duncan   2006- Dwyane Wade   2005- Tim Duncan   2004- Rip Hamilton/Chauncey Billups   2003- Tim Duncan   2002- Shaq   2001- Shaq   2000- Shaq   1999- Tim Duncan   1998- Jordan   1997- Jordan   1996- Jordan   1995- Hakeem   1994- Hakeem   1993- Jordan   1992- Jordan   1991- Jordan   1990- Isiah Thomas   1989- Joe Dumars   1988- Magic   1987- Magic   1986- Bird   1985- Kareem   1984- Bird   1983- Moses Malone   1982- Kareem   1981- Bird   1980- Kareem      So 20 if I'm counting right"
"It doesn't take much to earn an $8M contract, but yes he has.    For reference, he's making $1M more than Baynes, the same as Poetl, same as Thomas Bryant, $1M less than TT, $2M less than Meyers Leonard, $4M less than Olynyk, etc."
yeah there wasn't even Bertans or Thomas Bryant to get some of those shots. its a pretty ugly situation there.
"Always been a good scorer but this team fits him so well really allows him to leverage his traits and hide his weakness.    Also, as a lifelong Lakers fan, if makes me happy to see the young guys who were with us during the really dark times (zubac and thomas bryant also come to mind) playing competitive basketball and not be stuck in NBA purgatory.   He's really a great bench compliment to Donovan Mitchell.  You can rest Mitchell and still keep your game flow without not really changing much considering how similar they are on the offensive end (obv clarkson isn't as good) and defensive end."
"He's much more similar to KAT or Thomas Bryant than Adebayo. His defense has improved a lot this year, but he's nowhere near as versatile or bouncy as Bam."
"Can’t pin these losses on Beal. Of course his numbers are going to be inflated if you’re missing Rui Hachimura, Troy Brown Jr, Thomas Bryant, Davis Bertans, Russell Westbrook and Ish Smith"
"Sabonis and Oladipo were still lottery picks. Dipo  literally entered the league putting up 14/4/4 as a rookie. Rui and Deni are both out and Thomas Bryant is injures for the year. The talent around Beal, at least for today’s game was honestly as bad as an NBA team could get."
"Rui hachimura,thomas bryant, davis bertans, robin lopez       Amirite?"
Simmons and Westbrook in the dunker spot with Bertans and Advija handling the ball with Thomas Bryant in the corner
"Beal had no idea that his team would trade away Wall for Westbrick, I envy him. Also Thomas Bryant is injured."
"I'm just gonna throw this trade idea out there...  Warriors get: Bradley Beal, Thomas Bryant  Wizards get: James Wiseman, Andrew Wiggins, Minny's 2021 pick, and some other draft assets"
He probly won't but Kings should've traded him for at least a future 2nd round pick. Guys they could've drafted besides Giles:  Terrence Ferguson Jarrett Allen OG Anunoby Kuzma Derrick White Josh Hart Thomas Bryant Dillon Brooks
"Lakers boys doing work all around the league - Clarkson, Dlo, Ingram, Randle, Thomas Bryant and even Hart/Zo contributing."
I would  This is the top 10 players with the most turnovers  1. Karl Malone*	4524  2.	LeBron James	4478  3.	Moses Malone*	4264  4.	John Stockton*	4244  5.	Kobe Bryant*	4010  6.	Jason Kidd*	4003  7.	Julius Erving*	3940  8.	Artis Gilmore*	3926  9.	Isiah Thomas*	3682  10.	Hakeem Olajuwon*
Josh Hart and Thomas Bryant as well.  Still probably just a low-tier playoff team at best really.
"Some notable late picks in the last decade for teams-- most were picked after the 20th spot and quite a few past 25/in the second round   * 76ers: Thybulle, Shake * Blazers: Trent, Barton,  * Bucks: Brogdon,  * Bulls: Butler, Portis * Cavs: Joe Harris,  * Celtics: Semi, Payton, Powell * Clippers: Bullock,  * Grizzlies: Clarke, Tilman, Bane * Hawks: Mike Scott, Spellman * Heat: Richardson,  * Hornets: Devonte, * Jazz: Gobert,  * Kings: Thomas, Hassaan * Knicks: Robinson, Hardaway  * Lakers: Kuzma, Hart, Bryant, Clarkson  * Mavericks: Crowder, Brunson * Nets: Lavert, Bogdanovic * Nuggets: Jokic, Fournier, Faried * Pacers: Aaron Holiday, Stephenson * Pistons: Middleton, Dinwiddie  * Pelicans:  * Raptors: OG, Pascal * Spurs: White, Murray, Anderson, Bertans * Suns: Bogdonovic * Timberwolves: Tyus, Bjelica * Thunder * Warriors: Paschall, Draymond, Looney * Wizards:    Out of those teams, I think the over half (more if you include undrafted players) of the teams get better talent than the lakers in the later picks."
Is he still serviceable at the very least? I figure there's a few teams that could use another big man in the lineup. Maybe the Wizards after losing Thomas Bryant?
"Best team here tbh.  PG: Raul Neto, Cassius Wintson, Westbrook   SG: Beal, Garrison Matthews, Isaac Bonga   SF: Avidja, Troy Brown Jr., Jerome Robinson   PF: Rui Hachimura , Davis Bertans,  Anthony Gill   C: Robin Lopez, Mo Wagner, Thomas Bryant"
This gets funnier every time I watch it. Thomas Bryant dunking on the wrong basket vibes.
Connecting the dots I do think Nets are gonna add Hassan Whiteside or Javale Mcgee using the disabled player exception and second round picks or buyout market. They probably want to see if anyone is bought out and how Claxton looks before pulling the trigger.  As you mentioned Robin Lopez is prob also on the radar but with Thomas Bryant hurt I'm not sure it is likely unless Bradley Beal is gonna get moved
"My fantasy team got decimated last week: westbrook, thomas bryant and Levert all went down. With beal and the wiz on corona protocol"
"If Cavs are offering a Centre can we please have Drummond or Allen?  We lost Thomas “Don’t call me Kobe” Bryant to an ACL and now are running RoLo and Wagner (who has barely played this season) at Centre.  We desperately need a rim protector, not to mention our defense is asscheeks."
Thomas Bryant out for the year
Russ and Thomas Bryant + a second
"russ, beal, thomas bryant, rui, neto, latvian laser  for the pistons i dead could only name blake, rose, grant  i know plumlee too but he slipped my mind"
"Simmions is 24. They build around Simmions, Deni, Rui, Bertans, Thomas Bryant. Their lottery pick cause they are gonna be bad. Trade Russell Westbrook to OKC for Al Horford?"
The Wizards aren’t a win now team they need all the young talent they can get. So why would they trade their top pick from the draft and Thomas Bryant for two older centers?
"The Lakers fanbase keeps shitting on Kuz. But how many 27th picks get to play for the champs? Josh Hart was pick no. 30, Thomas Bryant 49th, Svi 47th. Lakers really drafted well."
"&gt; Centers are notorious for peaking their rookie years because the position is so easy  14 pts, 8 reb, 1 ast - Anthony Davis' ""peak"" rookie season.   10 pts, 7 reb, 2 ast - Nikola Jokic's ""peak"" rookie season.   7 pts, 6 reb, 2 ast - Bam Adebayo  2 pts, 3 reb, 1 blk - Rudy Gobert  6 pts, 5 reb, 1 ast - Nikola Vucevic  6 pts, 5 reb, 1 blk - Serge Ibaka  4 pts, 5 reb, 1 blk - Deandre Jordan  3 pts, 3 reb, 1 blk - Clint Capela  2 pts, 1 reb - Thomas Bryant  3 pts, 4 reb, 1 blk - Steven Adams"
"They’re thin at C now with Thomas Bryant out.  They have Wagner and Pasecniks.  They’re likely not competing for a playoff spot.  It’s not a sure thing, but I could see them waiving him so he could go to a contender."
"Absolutely not, if you put James Harden in the trade finder, 2k says, “**we can offer Thomas Bryant and a ‘23 2nd-round pick, and you’ll like it**”"
"Yup. The trending direction for Lamelo is exactly what you want in a rebuilding franchise or a franchise trying to push back into playoff noise. You don't want a ""could he be good if given 2 years of minutes to see?"" Level player.   The lakers had PLENTY of ""could he be good if given seasoning?"" Players (Svi, Thomas Bryant, Nance etc. etc.) and moved em (even if it turned out as a shit trade) to try and push. Wiseman is a ""what if"" not a budding star."
"Completely correct. I got lured in by Wood's first few games that he might be an all-star-level talent. If htat were true, then I do think a lot becomes possible. But if Wood's ceiling is Serge Ibaka/Thomas Bryant/Harrison Barnes--i.e. Wood as a quality starter, but nothing more--then this season is not happening."
"I just traded Chris Paul and Drummond for Kyrie and Thomas Bryant a week ago in fantasy, yay."
"Yeah Beal really should have taken his team to the playoffs witj Davis Bertans....uh...a rookie Rui Hachimura...and uh, Troy Brown Jr and Thomas Bryant."
"I think anyone who thinks with the way Westbrook has declined over the last several years that they will win more games with him playing than sitting is fooling themselves.   He is absolutely atrocious this year. They're a bad team anyway. If they want to be average, just let Beal hero ball and Bertans chuck threes. It also helps that Thomas Bryant is no longer in there defensively."
"Honestly I bet on the wizards making the playoffs are the start of the season, they look super good on paper so I'm not surprised they're winning, 2 all stars in Beal and Westbrook, Bertans, Thomas Bryant, Rui, Israeli Rookie, etc"
"Jalen Brunson, KCP, Martin twins, Thomas Bryant"
"You're really missing the point here. Thomas Bryant is a terrible defensive anchor, and that's the problem."
Thomas Bryant regularly cooks Ayton go look at his games against the suns lol.
DA would've dropped 25+ if he was facing Thomas Bryant down low lol
Thomas Bryant was holding the Wizards back!
Thomas Bryant was holding the Wizards back!
Nah it's because thomas bryant wasn't getting smoked on defense all game.
Thomas Bryant out too tho
and then the suns go and lose by 20 to a wizards team without westbrook or thomas bryant....what a year.
We won because of Thomas Bryant not Westbrook
So I guess Thomas Bryant has been the problem this entire time. Unleash ROBIN LOPEZ
Mo Wagner completely changes the spacing on the floor.  It was destiny for Thomas Bryant to get hurt and for Mo Wagner to save Scott Brooks' job.
"Everyone saying that Russ is the problem is wrong. It was Thomas Bryant. While I feel bad for his injury has he was progressing offensively, he was Swiss cheese defensively, essentially making him a net negative."
"Hmm. If we’re truly saying like no defense at all, that’s hard to find. People like Luka had atleast an inkling of defense within them.  But:  Trae Young/Devin Booker/Andrew Wiggins/Kevin Love/Thomas Bryant"
"The path to winning an NBA title *without* a player at James Harden's level is incredibly narrow. The 2004 Pistons are the only team in the last 40 years to win a title without one of the 20-30ish best players of all time as the #1 option. Every other champion in that span has had at least one of the following players leading the team: LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett, Shaquille O'Neal, Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Isaiah Thomas, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, or Moses Malone.  IMO, the risk of keeping Harden outweighs the risk you take by giving him up. I don't think there's a trade package out there that gets you a player with the potential to jump into that rarified level of talent that's required to win the title."
Also thomas Bryant(rip).   I think nwaba is on a roster somewhere too still? Not sure if he’s getting pt
"Raptors are much better.    More interesting question would be whether the answer would've been different if they swapped coaches, at least before the Thomas Bryant injury."
"Ideally, you can at least construct an offensive roster with the team.  Starters: Russ / Beal / Deni / Rui / Thomas Bryant (I know he tore his ACL) - In a perfect world that's 4 shooters around Russ.  Bench: Ish Smith / Troy Brown / Mo Wagner / Issac Bonga / Robin Lopez - It's not a fantastic bench but whatever  I could have seen the argument that they could fight for the play-in but things have just fallen off a cliff."
I meant thomas when I said bryant haha but yeah clarkson too good point
I'd add Jordan Clarkson and Thomas Bryant to your list of unexpected gems drafted by the Lakers. Even Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk may continue to develop into something special as a sharpshooter a la Seth Curry in this league.
"Not at all. That's $1M more than Baynes, the same as Poetl, same as Thomas Bryant, $1M less than TT, $2M less than Meyers Leonard, $4M less than Olynyk, etc.  It's right around what you'd expect a low-end starting center to make."
"Clarkson, Nance, Zubac, Kuzma, Josh Hart, Thomas Bryant, Moe Wagner, Svi, THT, and picked up Caruso from the OKC Thunder G-League."
"What? They lose Thomas Bryant so they need to tank?  I hate this mentality that if you're not a contender you need to trade away all stars to tank. Bad thread, OP."
Thomas Bryant fire mage confirmed
It was one of his 3 (maybe 4-5) consecutive tweets about thomas Bryant. You just wanna be triggered for no reason
"This strikes me as bait, but I'll respond anyways.  Beal has been a pretty strongly net positive player for his entire career. Over the past few seasons with the Wizards, he's arguably carried a bigger offensive load than any other player in the league. He's been in the 94th ,95th, and 100th percentile in terms of his impact on his team's offense.   He hasn't been as good a defender as he was earlier in his career, but players who carry that offensive load rarely are. He's far from the biggest problem on the Wizards though. They have several players who log big minutes and are serious negatives defensively. Most notably Thomas Bryant, but Rui, Bertans and now Westbrook are also not good defenders.  The Wizards are essentially an even net-rating team with Beal on the court this season. They are about -7.0 per 100 possessions with him on the bench."
The entire wizards team is horrible on defense so blaming it squarely on Beal is unfair. He is usually one of the better defenders on the floor (although that only attributes to about average defense) but when your “defensive anchor” is Swiss Cheese Thomas Bryant and the rest of the team is subpar defenders you let up tons of points
"what’s good with jaylen? contact tracing, injury or what? i’d hate to see him miss this one. also, don’t be TOO worried about this game considering we nearly lost to a wizards squad with no beal, westbrook or thomas bryant LOL"
"Your eyes are failing you then, because when Beal and Russ are playing, Rui doesn't get much usage either. And he picked up a quick foul to get injured Thomas Bryant off the floor tonight and was limited in minutes with foul trouble. Still he played a good game despite being double teamed on top of it all. Hating on Rui doesn't make Deni look better my dude, just compliment Deni.   &gt; And you can shit on Deni all you want, my best guess him and Rui are out the league in 6 years or sooner  Oh so you're a troll, great"
"I wish I could say the same, but he comes back and embiid and Thomas Bryant go out. Can’t get the squad at full health, this season feels cursed"
Bad news: Thomas Bryant might be seriously hurt and we'll have to watch Robin Lopez play basketball.  Good news: Mo Wagner is forced to get more minutes.
"Today is not a good day for my fantasy team (Beal, Westbrook, Thomas Bryant)"
"Brooks isn't a good coach but this isn't really his fault. Thomas Bryant gets lost on every PnR defensive scenario, he's absolutely atrocious in defense. Beal is surrounded by terrible defensive players, and they're not very good overall to begin with"
Thomas Bryant Russ Bertans and whoever the fifth player is not named Beal all suck at defense
While Russ and Thomas Bryant are competing for the defensive rebound.
"I know people are complaining about brooks’s defensive gameplan, and he deserves some of the blame but watching Thomas Bryant on defense, I can confidently say that the dude probably provides the worst rim protection among all centers with decent minutes in the league."

"That's not the point, back in the days he was a ""great when he tries, meh overall"" defender and his teams could leave with it because he played with great defenders, now he's mostly a ""meh the one possession per game he tries, horrendous overall"" and he no longer plays with Paul George, Roberson and Steven Adams but with Thomas Bryant, Ish Smith and Rui Hachimura."
Thomas Bryant trembling because that’s his assignment
"Thomas ""Tacko Fall"" Bryant"
"Tbh I think we could give Thomas Bryant 40 but still win comfortably. Just gotta make sure he’s not getting 40 off pure offensive rebounds, but that’s what’s chill about the Celtics for the last 2 years, we get a lot of defensive rebounding help from the Jays and Smart. With Al we would lose every game by 10 rebounds, but with Theis we’ve been weirdly on the top end of rebounding teams."
Thomas Bryant gonna FEAST
Thomas Bryant has That many clutch shot attempts? Wtf does he have a go to play or just o board like a mad man in crunch time
I was surprised for Thomas Bryant tbh.
"Thanks for looking this up for us. I am somehow both surprised and not so surprised at Thomas Bryant, but Jokic with twice the volume doesn't surprise me at all."
"He's 2nd in the league behind Thomas Bryant for the last 3 years, although Bryant has about half the number of attempts. Jokic is 17/26 for a .654 FG%.  Last 2 minutes of 4th or OT, tie or go ahead."
"This year was supposed to be it. A healthy John, a healthy Brad, Bertans, Rui, Avdija, a solid back up point guard crew, Troy Brown, and offensive talent in Thomas Bryant, and a defense of stopper in Robin Lopez. Everything lined up perfectly for a above 50 win, in a regular season, season!"
Thomas bryant is awful on defense. He has potential on offense but nobody in the league wants a center that cant protect the rim.
"Thomas Bryant was cooked so hard by Embiid and Embiid would beat him 95% of the time so the options they have:   1. Let Embiid cook Bryant one on one with no help, it's 2 points or free throws.  2. Double team Embiid but will leave someone open like Curry, Green, Harris and Milton. Embiid is getting much better at passing out of the double team and Wizard's defense is pretty bad.  3. Westbrook defend Simmons in the post, Simmons would beat Westbrook one on one in the post and posterized him.      He had to decide on what to do with Embiid + Simmons, they are not all good options. So he went to gambit for a steal at the moment when Embiid's back was turned"
Don't forget Thomas Bryant!
"I get it man. Wb and thomas bryant sold, bryants defense is terrible. At least you have Beal, he's a spectacular player and I'm sure you'll get it together (although Russ is pretty ass). I remember looking and I'm sure that Embiid blocked the ball, and when he was bringing his arm down he hit Beal's hand. IMO it shouldn't be a foul, since he didn't affect the shot by any illegal way."
"Also the out of bounds at the end and a few missed calls for russ, but just hot shooting from seth and some close misses from bertans and beal at the end really pushed the game over. Thomas Bryant should not have played those many minutes"
Thomas. Effin. Bryant.
THT was a 2019 2nd rounder.  Probably have to consider the Thomas Bryant and Hart for Tony Bradley as essentially a draft since that was a draft day deal which IIRC happened before the Bryant pick was announced.  &amp;#x200B;  Also can't forget the undrafted bald mamba.  &amp;#x200B;  Say what you will about LAL player development but the scouting side looks legit.
"Yeah plus Zubac, Thomas Bryant, Mo Wagner, Kuzma, Caruso, THT. Could be a frisky team."
thomas bryant
"Bruh mine has been decimated. Christian Wood, PG, Thomas Bryant, Kawhi, D'Lo... I could keep going but I have like 5 dudes out at like any given time"
MPJ has The combined basketball IQ of Javele McGee and Thomas Bryant
"We were hurt by injuries at the beginning of year  - Westbrook playing injured  - Hachimura out with Pink Eye / Bertans out of shape and on minutes restriction.   Then we started turning it around a bit  - Thomas Bryant tore his ACL  - 75% of the team were out due to covid + didn't basketball for 2 weeks  - So lost like 4 games due to players being out ... and then the next couple games they were back .. still weren't in rhythm ( probably due to not playing any for 2 weeks).  Finally got some good continuity and turned it into a win streak.  - Better defense from the team in general ( Rui really stepped up )  - Moving Garrison Matthews / Mo Wagner to the starting line up provided some more energy and shooting to the starting line up. Also moved Lopez/Advija to the bench .. where they played better.  - Ish Smith being injured, meaning Brooks couldn't sabatoge with 3 PG lineups."
huh? dudes certified nets killer lmao  him and Thomas Bryant lol
I think the Wizards have some sort of exception for Thomas Bryant. It would be ironic and great for the wizards to pick him up if possible.
"Nah, its generally the other way around, a real small percentage of lakers fan do that, while other teams fans act like all lakers are trash and will never ammount to anything BI,Randle,DLO allstars, Lonzo, JC, Nance, Thomas Bryant solid rotation players, and who can forget Alex “hes just a meme, people only talk about because he is white and bald on the Lakers” Caruso a solid rotation player on a championship team"
Recently it's probably... Lakers  Ingram randle dlo Clarkson kuzma Thomas Bryant THT zubac
Injury to Thomas Bryant has been a godsend for mo

"The thing about Mo is he’s supposed to match up with quicker centers better but he can’t even do that, his BBall IQ is so low on defense and he commits so many fouls he’s just not it for us, that’s where losing Thomas Bryant was huge for us."
"If we still had Thomas Bryant, we would definitely be a pretty good playoff team. I don't think we would be in the finals, though."
On paper they do look like they should be in the middle of the eastern conference. Russ and Bertans looking like garbage killed all steam. Unfortunately the ship has  sailed with Thomas Bryant injury too.
"A lot of factors lead our rough start ...  - Westbrook starting the season injured and playing through it.  - We only have 2 PFs ... Rui started the season injured, and Bertans came in out of shape and on a minutes restriction.   Then we finally started looking better  - Thomas Bryant tore his ACL  - like 75% of the team got covid .. and didn't play basketball for 2 weeks   - had to play like 4 games with Beal/Westbrook and scrubs because we had like 6 keys guys in the protocol.   Then took time to back into rhythm"
Thomas Bryant is missin too
Clarkson was actually the 46th pick! We are hitting on all picks. Thomas Bryant looked pretty solid as well.
"They didn't waste it they won a ring lol.   They couldn't have gotten AD without giving lonzo, hart, and BI. They kept luz cause he was cheap and y'all didn't want them.   Thomas bryant and wagner weren't gonna perform like howard did in that playoff run. They're too young"
"want to talk about starting next to people who play no d.  Russ is an atrocious defender, Thomas Bryant when he played was even worse, Davis Bertans is maybe wirse that Isaiah"
"I think there's 2 questions, who's better and who would you rather have.    ***  Tatum's the better player but Isaiah had the better season.  To me you're comparing a really good player and a really good player on a hot streak. It's not Tatum vs Isaiah, it's Tatum vs Isaiah on a hot streak and in the NBA, the guy on the hot streak is generally better.     2016-17 Isaiah sustained that hot streak for the entire season. He was legitimately unstoppable and historic in terms of his consistency ([eg1,](https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/842208850996523009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E842208850996523009%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbssports.com%2Fnba%2Fnews%2Fisaiah-thomas-joins-michael-jordan-and-kobe-bryant-in-exclusive-scoring-club%2F) [eg2](https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/832051022155612160)). Every game teams would line up to stop him, every game he'd walk over them.  Isaiah legitimately has a claim on the best non-Bird offensive season by a Celtic and was top 5 in MVP voting. Tatum's amazing and he'll be a regular top 5 player soon enough, but Isaiah playing like a top 5 player is better than Tatum.    ***  In terms of who I'd rather have, Tatum. We're too small across the board for Isaiah right now."
"all the ex-Laker success lately has been nice.  Ball - Clarkson - Ingram - Nance Jr. - Randle would be a pretty damn decent lineup these days. Could probably do some things in the east, especially if we had more size with Thomas Bryant, Moe Wagner, or Zubac"
"Indeed it is. Beal having a career year next to him. Thomas Bryant was before he went down. Bertans had a career night last night.   'And after all the 'Wizards are 2-450823 with Westy', he's starting on the team while on a 3-game win streak, which they haven't done since 2018.  Yes, there's a lot to consider with basketball. And yes, he would/should start on a lot of other teams than the Wizards."
"I don't really want him but we could get there with Thomas Bryant, Robin Lopez, Ish Smith, and Jerome Robinson ..."
Book of Basketball 2.0 podcast is good but I don't know it's the best way to start. I would recommend you the championship documentaries of title teams. Then some 30 for 30 like Magic and Bird etc.   The players you should look for from top of my head would be:  George Mikan  Bill Russell  Jerry West(Logo)  Wilt Chamberlain  Oscar Robertson  Bob Cousy  John Havlicek  Tommy Heinsohn  Julius Erving  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  Willis Reed  Bill Walton  Magic Johnson  Larry Bird  Isaiah Thomas   Michael Jordan  Hakeem Olajuwon  Shaquille O'Neal  Tim Duncan  Kobe Bryant  Kevin Garnett
Thomas Bryant too.   His stats have improved every year since being traded to the Wizards.
"Those are incomplete numbers for this analysis.  Do the math on available attempts.  Some of those players played with Bryant -- good luck getting more than a couple shots a game in that situation -- and as shown by this very post, the Lakers were deep with young players who need lots of chances to figure out what works for them, and what doesn't.  Ingram: 11.5 FGA in Los Angeles, 17.8 in New Orleans  Clarkson: 12.6 FGA in LA, 13.4 in Utah  Russell:: 12.7 FGA in LA, 17 in Brooklyn, 19 in Golden State, and 17 in Minnesota  Ball: 10.3 in LA, 11.2 in New Orleans  Nance: 5.4 in LA, 7.3 in Cleveland  Randle: 10.6 in LA, 16 in New York  Russell, Nance, Randle, and Ingram have also seen their minutes rise since heading east.  There's only one ball ( lower-case ), and it's tough to develop that many players ( and Thomas Bryant, and Ivica Zubac and Josh Hart and Kyle Kuzma and Mo Wagner ) in such a short span -- especially when you have Bryant and James.  There are recent ex-Lakers all over the league in part because they just drafted so many good players that they had logjams everywhere -- and that probably hurt almost all of them, to so degree or another."
"But what about the late 1st round-2nd round picks? Kuz, Clarkson, Caruso (undrafted), Hart, Thomas Bryant, Svi, Lance, Mo Wagner? Only real miss in recent years was Anthony Brown. Deep in the draft is where scouting talent shows and the Lakers have had consistently good-great picks in that range"
"I'd be curious to see how good an All-""Former Young Lakers Players"" team would look in current day. The lineup would be something like:  PG: D'Angelo Russell/Lonzo Ball  SG: Jordan Clarkson/Josh Hart  SF: Brandon Ingram/David Nwaba  PF: Julius Randle/Larry Nance Jr.  C: Ivaca Zubac/Thomas Bryant"
"Don't forget Kuzma, Lonzo, Hart, Thomas Bryant, Mo Wagner and THT.  Also Caruso technically wasn't drafted by the Lakers but we did develop him."
Zubac and Thomas Bryant
"Troy Brown Jr. ish smith, Robin lopez. Thomas Bryant and the 4 mill exception. Get it done. Thanks I’ll be waiting to draft Andre Drummond as a wizard on draftkings."
The Post in Washington sucks after Thomas Bryant went down
Thomas Bryant too.
"D'Lo, Caruso, Ingram, Randle, and Wagner is a pretty solid team in itself lol. With Nance, Ball, Clarkson, Thomas Bryant, and Kuzma off the bench."
"Embiid, Jokic, KAT, Gobert, Bam, Porzingis, Nurkic, Vucevic, Ayton, Jonas, Wood, Allen, Capela, Adams, BroLo, Turner, Drummond make 17. Then arguably Thomas Bryant, Dan Theis, Mitchell Robinson, and LaMarcus Aldridge."
"Opposing styles of play. Russ needs spacing and rim running pnr players, so someone like thomas Bryant was great for him until he got injured. With the current roster, moe Wagner does the role well, and even Len has been shooting decently.   Lopez on the other hand is great for shoring up the defense while providing more of a back to basket scoring game so having him with beal makes more sense given beal can score from anywhere"

Thomas Bryant is a one way player.
"Blockbuster Trade that will change the NBA and will make every team better. Teams involved are Bucks, Heat, Wizards, &amp; Celtics  Bucks receive: Russell Westbrook, Bradley Beal  Wizards receive: Kris Middleton, Kelly Olynyk, Kendrick Nunn, Robert Williams, Donte Divincenzo, DJ Wilson, 4 bench players from the heat to make the cap work. &amp; a first round pick from the bucks.   Heat receive: Kemba Walker, Thomas Bryant, 2nd round pick from Bucks   Celtics receive: Jrue Holiday, Andre Igoudala, 2nd round pick from Bucks     What this trade does:  The East instantly becomes very competitive.   Miami Heat: They will get better by adding Kemba Walker for basically Kendrick Nunn and Olynyk. They’ll have Thomas Bryant under contract for next year and will only get better with a core of Kemba Herro Robinson Butler Adebayo Myers Leonard Dragic and Avery Bradley. Kemba will add a lot of fire power to their offense. He will fit right in with all of the shooters and ball movement the Heat play with. Instant championship contenders barring injuries.  Celtics: The Celtics are a great young team as of right now. The duo of Tatum and Brown looks better everyday. The problem is as of right now is that Kemba doesn’t fit well with them. He is also a liability on defense for them. This trade will get them Jrue Holiday and Iggy. They will get a lot better on defense and I think Jrue would fit right into their team. Iggy will be a nice piece off the bench. They do lose Robert Williams, but that is why they get a 2nd round pick in return.   Bucks: This should be a no brainer for them if they want to compete. At the end of the day it is a long season and they can definitely turn it around in the playoffs. But they can also have Russ, Beal, Giannis as their core. They have a great bench and solid role players. This trade will make them a championship threat rather than a hopeful run. By the looks of it, they will lose in playoffs the same way they’ve lost the last 2 years. Especially if they have to see the Nets. This trade possibly makes them the best team in the East. Bradley Beal is a heck of a player that got want to have. If Giannis can get a player that can score at will and on top of it get the energy Russ brings, they will be extremely hard to stop.   Wizards: The Wizards are in rebuild mode. The Wizards will lose Westbrook and Bradley Beal. They will be getting in return a whole lot of prospects and players they can offer for trade. Kris Middleton is in his prime and has multiple years under his contract. It might be hard to move him right now but in the future there will be some value for him. They will be getting Kendrick Nunn and Robert Williams. Both players could be future all stars. Dante Divincenzo who is a solid role player. Kelly Olynyk who they can always use for trade bait. They will also get a bunch of other young guys and a first round pick from the Bucks to top it all off.   In the end, all of these teams get better. The east will have multiple contenders consisting of the Nets, Bucks, Heat, Celtics, and 76ers. You won’t be able to tell who will win the east if this trade happens. As of right now the Nets will probably win the east.. This trade definitely makes it unpredictable as to who will win the east.    Who says no to this trade? Let me know your feedback."
"Zu, Svi, Thomas Bryant, Nwaba.. lakers really dug deep to find some gems.."
Blown high draft picks that landed us AD. Totally useless right?  Also our draft picks although not home runs haven't been busts. Randle Dlo Ingram have all been paid and are essential pieces to cornerstones of their respective franchises. Guys like Clarkson Nance Thomas Bryant are also key rotation players/starters
u really think ish smith and thomas bryant would’ve made a difference?
"I gave up watching Washington cause it's literally the saddest team in the league. I mean you have Beal who is literally leading the league in scoring on solid efficency and then you Westbrook who is once again doing his usual unicorn triple double business and the team still completely fucking sucks. Like how can you have two guys putting up HISTORICALLY GREAT levels of performance, Beal's scoring this year is as good as a year from prime Kobe, NO ONE cares though. It's so sad.   That and DC is in fucking no man's land in the saddest way. Like DC has some of the most promising young talents in the league. Deni is so good and gets used SO BADLY in DC. Rui has tons of potential but obviously he has to defer to the real stars of the team. Thomas Bryant is actually an offensive beast of a center but is injured rn.   For some reason they throw fucking Davis Bertans an $80 million contract like he's gonna be a piece for them to contend with. Like Bertans is a great shooter, he's no 3 and D guy though, he doesn't play defense well. Like for a proper 3 and D guy the money makes sense, for Bertans it's such a disgusting over pay.   You know what else made no sense? Trading Mo Wagner for Daniel Gafford. Like that trade says ""We're in rebuilding mode now"" Mo Wagner was actually really solid for DC defensively. At this point it really feels like a Beal trade is going to happen in the summer, like there's no way DC loads up on more developing talent while keeping the league leading scorer on the roster. Beal really does deserve better, DC doesn't deserve his loyalty. At least with Portland like Dame gets enough help to always keep Portland as a playoff team at worst and a dark horse at best. DC has literally none of that, there was hope that this year would be a playoff year for DC and that's completely failed.   DC needs to go all in and decide ""we're contending or rebuilding"". The franchise has been so sad since Wall signed that supermax only to get injured and it's completely ruined whatever potential there was. There might be an alternative universe where Wall never gets injured and DC continues to make noise in the East and stays comparable to the Celtic's with two great stars and a light chance of being a destination for FA's."
"Thomas Bryant has missed 40 games this season, rui has missed 9, beal missed 8..   It’s not Russ bud. Hate to break it to you. Try watching the games"
"&gt; in those 40 games that Isaiah played, Beal missed 7, Bertans missed 7, Thomas Bryant missed 13, Rui missed 21"
Thomas Bryant with the bench 3!!!
"I think that’s only true of both the best and most disciplined defenders *and* I don’t think leaving any NBA player “open” is a real viable strategy. I mentioned it in a previous comment but Dort obviously isn’t a shooter and he hurt them in the first round last year iirc.  You mention drop coverage but I don’t think I made it clear the PnR is happening around midrange/FT line, drop coverage would essentially give him a floater. I think teams often start playing the way you described (happy to concede the midrange) at the beginning of games and dependent on his shooting outcomes adjust whether they mean too or not.   For me it’s necessary to open up his game/floor on a bad team (which the Wizards currently are) and the positives for the Wizards offense outweigh the difference in value gained by having someone else take those shots.   Which is a whole other thing people never consider when it comes to efficiency. Efficiency is a long term metric that’s highly volatile in the short term. The difference beteeen a 35% three point shooter career and a 38% three point shooter career is minuscule over the course of any single game (dependent to difficult of shots/type of shots/attempts/etc I’m just qualifying this). I don’t get exactly who people expect Russ to give the ball to, to take these shots and not only produce as efficiently if not more so than he is. The Wizards have been terrible outside of Beal/WB. Rui hasn’t had the leap I expected (but he was injured/Covid iirc) and with Thomas Bryant out they’re playing fucking Robin Lopez at center. I don’t think the difference in the shots he’d be giving up is so great it would warrant criticism and would also require taking the ball out of his hands sometimes.   I’m not saying it’s not the best option for defenses, I’m saying it’s necessary for WB game given the roster construction and honestly with the rest of their surrounding talent I’m not sure what the expected answer is. This would be way different if Bertans was shooting like he did last year and Hachimura made a small leap, but I don’t think the options aren’t him even warrant the discussion at the moment."
I guess I really wasn’t expecting a rebuttal from someone who thinks Thomas Bryant is the explanation for russ having a 50% ts
"Gotta reply on alt cause I blocked that guy and for whatever reason it prevents me from seeing any of the thread at all outside my comments specifically (mobile).  My initial point was to highlight at his rudimentary thought process, bad TS% means he should shoot less. You can have that as a general rule and mostly be alright but in this specific situation it’s lacking so much context it indicated to me he hasn’t watched the game.  If you’re asking me personally how I feel about Westbrook shooting % relative to his shooting frequency, I think it should be *slightly* curtailed but it’s a necessarily evil essentially. Let’s get some quick things out of the way, Westbrook is an all-time shot creator and finisher at the rim (second one I’m not remembering as well so double check it on bballref or whatever, but especially for his position). Some of what allows his to shot creation is penetration (I think OP would’ve had more of an argument if Westbrook has some better spacing, ( inherently implying better shooters). If his shooting isn’t great around him he will have to shoot some shots on his own, NBA players in spite of % will guard their man closer especially if he makes one or two (and let’s be honest no nba player not even the worst shooters should be left literally wide open, Dort was killing the Rockets in the playoffs last year doing just that iirc), this allows drives which not only allows scoring but allows assists/potential assists.   That’s not even getting into shit like how skewed the stats are season given how the Wizards had covid, I think Russ had surgery in the off season along with Covid, eye test, Ortgs (which I haven’t bothered to check but I’m so damn sure they’re in my favor I’ll list em anyway if I look like a fool so be it, Thomas Bryant injury, general roster construction, having fucking Scott Brooks as the coach, and even more mitigating factors that go into giving context to the stats surrounding the season so far.   My logic isn’t some simple garbage that triple doubles are good or something, I think this current Wizard team has immense construction/coaching issues first and foremost and that not only do Westbrook and the Wizards when being analyzed need to be filtered through that but also a myriad  of other things (like Covid) and that it’s a lot more than just their TS%. Which is why I asked if he watched the games. I think there’s simply not a ton of options besides the way they’ve been playing given roster construction/coach/general team talent and that while I do think he takes errant shots and should curtail it a bit some of his shooting is necessary for his creation to function which is a greater positive than an extra 3-4 slightly better shots a night.   Thoughts?"
The covid infecting a few players didn't help. Ish Smith/Thomas Bryant were healthy last year plus Bertans has been pretty disappointing so far this season.  But yeah the Wizards have been pretty disappointing this season.
Found another guy who doesn’t understand that TS% isn’t the only stat in the world to measure players by.  Here let’s assume you’re even a little bit informed and ask you the next logical question? Who on that Wizards team should be taking the shots instead? Beal who’s already shooting a ton? Bertans who’s shooting has fallen off a cliff comparatively to last year? Rui/Deni? Injured Thomas Bryant?  How many Wizards games you watch this year? Or are you just another clown who can read basketball reference and thinks that means they understand the game?
you missed thomas bryant

"Yeah, I wonder how he'd be valued if you removed #2 pick from his resume and he was drafted in the 2nd round like Thomas Bryant.   I imagine some Warriors fans would be calling for him to be waived since he's a waste of a roster spot."

"Let's call a spade a spade and just acknowledge that Washington doesn't have much legitimate NBA talent on their roster, especially with Thomas Bryant out.  It's basically Bradley Beal, a declining and very inefficient Westbrook, two mid level prospects in Rui/Deni, a washed RoLo, and then end of bench guys.  With the Wall/Westbrook trade, I think they're probably in purgatory for the next few seasons. They probably need to blow it up and move Beal for the good of the team."
"&gt;What?  The Lakers win a ring every 4 years, on average, and Towns would've been a Laker for 5 by now.  Their rate is much higher when they have a top center, as well, somewhere around 50%, actually.  So he'd certainly have one, and quite likely more.  Towns has been an extremely good player from his 2nd season on, and if you think about their roster moves over the past 6 years, it's obvious they'd have been very competitive with Towns.    Had they drafted Towns instead of Russell, in 2017 they'd have had Towns, Randle, Ingram, Nance up front and even though young, that's as-good as anyone's frontcourt. They'd have never signed Mozgov -- almost certainly a guard, instead.  Maybe they still draft Zubac in the second round to backup Towns -- which is by-far the best center tandem in the league in short order -- or they flip him for a guard, because they wouldn't need or want Muscala.  They don't sign Andrew Bogut's corpse, either.  They probably don't dump Jordan Clarkson and Nance to clear that second max free agent spot, since they wouldn't need to.  They don't waste a 2019 second trading for Roy Hibbert, either.  They don't trade for Thomas Bryant, either.  There's not any telling who'd they'd draft after that point, but that front office did not really miss on draft picks, so they would likely be good.  They probably don't trade for Kuzma, but don't really need him anyway with the aforementioned forwards.  They almost certainly don't spend two more late-first round picks on centers in Moe Wagner, and Tony Bradley if they have Towns -- probably get guys like Derrick White, or Jalen Brunson instead.  They also don't fire Byron Scott in 2016, who was a very good coach.  The Lakers have wasted a ton of assets since 2015 in searching for a quality big man, and then blew an unprecedented package of assets to rent one last season.  With Towns, none of that would've been necessary, and they'd have been a far more attractive free-agent destination to boot.  There is basically no time in NBA history where the Lakers had a top 5 center and didn't at least make the Finals more often than not -- and the Lakers have had a top 5 center for about 30 seasons."
"In this house, we stan Thomas Bryant"
That excuse only works if Washington is the only team in the league negatively impacted by covid protocols.  If every single team in the league is handicapped. Then no one is significantly handicapped.  Westbrook will never hold any blame according to his fans.  He limits team's ceilings-but he's a floor raiser!  He can't raise a garbage team's floor-thomas bryant is an mvp level player whose production cannot be replaced (shades of the same tired excuse with andre roberson)
Lmao. Listen to yourself. Adding westbrook isn't enough to make up for thomas fucking bryant being out? Essentially lost Isaiah thomas and thomas bryant and added westbrook this season.  Doesn't that tell you how good westbrook is?
"This is a terrible take, Westbrook may not be an all star level player but you can't blame him when he's literally surrounded by G-League players.  Wizards had a shit version of Bertans, lost Thomas Bryant for the season, had barely traded for impact players at the deadline (Gafford being the only one being good).   His backcourt buddy when Beal is out, is Jerome Robinson. JEROME ROBINSON"
"Chose either one of those explication :  \- Russ is a stad padding demon sent to destroy teams  \- Thomas Bryant, Davis Bertans, Troy Brown and Ish Smith were their 2nd, 3rd, 4th and  th best players last year (or at least the 5 who had the more win shares I didn't watch). Bryant has been out all year, Bertans was out of shape to start the year, Troy Brown was out of the rotation all year and Ish is the worst possible fit next to Russ"
"The first step needs to be firing Scott Brooks. I think between Westbrook, Beal, and Hachimura, you can create a solid starting lineup with a few role players. Combine that with a 2nd unit of Avdija, Bertans, and Thomas Bryant next year, and there's a solid roster there that should AT LEAST be in the play-in tournament."
Kinda rough going missing Bertans and Thomas Bryant. I hope we can get another reliable shooter in the off season and maybe a lottery pick.
  There's always 2 sides to the narrative  Russ is good for Rui/Thomas Bryant (ACL). Bad for Deni/Troy/Bonga
"And some of us feel like we could be goddamn scouts.  * D'Lo - called it that he should just be a 6th man, but like Manu Ginobili * Randle - called it that his shot and handle was improving to the point where he'd be a decent Point Forward * BI - called it he'd be an all-star * Lonzo - called it that he'd be a great 3/D PG but he really needs help on running an actual offense in the half court * Zubac - called it that he's an ideal Center-center, that you can use when there's another actual Center on the court * Thomas Bryant - called it that he'd be a good backup C * Steve Blake - called it that he's an asshole"
"&gt;Thomas Bryant went down, which was a blow, but one would have expected Westbrook to elevate the wins column more than he has.  You're underrating this a lot. We've been playing a rotation of RoLo and Alex Len.   We've also been without Bertans for a lot of the season, and when he has been playing, he's looked out of shape and his shots been off in at least half the game's he's played. He was scoring 15ppg last season, to go along with TB's 13, that's a lot of fucking points!   The defense on this team has been bad, and while Russ doesn't necessarily help in that regard he's not the reason that it is bad. On the other hand he's been ridiculously good on offense as of late, it just hasn't translated to wins.    He started the season unhealthy and we just got through a brutal stretch against some strong teams, we didn't just lose a to a bunch of lottery teams or something. There's still a very strong chance this team makes the play in games, and if everyone's still healthy by then anything is possible."
"The Wizards win rate is on pace to basically win only 2 more games than they did last year.  Westbrook's impact so far has been to win them 2 more games over last season when Wall was out the entire season.  Thomas Bryant went down, which was a blow, but one would have expected Westbrook to elevate the wins column more than he has.    He wasnt at 100% at the beginning of the season, but even now they're struggling to win.  The Wizards have lost 8 of the last 10.  Russ is putting up stats but turning over the ball a lot, shooting poorly from the line, and playing a bit inconsistently.  No one was expecting the Wizards to dominate the East with a Westbrook/Beal combo, but even people who were lukewarm on Westbrook weren't predicting that the Wizards would be far out of the playoff picture and on pace to only win 27 games.  A good amount of blame falls on Brooks, but Russ was supposed to add a lot more to the Wizards."
"And Zu, Thomas Bryant, Svi... I think the only pick they had that was out of the league before the end of their rookie contract was Anthony Brown lol. Even Matt Thomas is getting burn and he came up on their G-League team. Absolutely bonkers."
"Well, it was supposed to be Thomas Bryant that benefited the most, and Rui would indeed be the odd man out.  But since they're playing losing basketball and heck, there isn't anybody else over 6'5 that deserves the ball anyway, it's Rui.  Right now Thomas Bryant should be averaging 18/7or so on really good efficiency in slightly less than 30 mins."
Don't forget Jordan Clarkson and Thomas Bryant too
"For the Suns, Thomas Bryant always went off on us, although it’s been a while now. Grayson Allen usually plays well against us lately."
As a suns fan? Jamal Murray. Second options? Thomas Bryant and ish smith. Don’t ask me why
Their starting center in Thomas Bryant is injured so they have relied on Len and RoLo
Too bad y’all lost Thomas Bryant in the beginning he was playing well
"coaches might increase your defensive floor but not the ceiling. if you have Thomas Bryant at C, your ceiling is gonna be low."
"1. Michael Jordan  2. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  3. Bill Russell  4. Tim Duncan  5. LeBron James  6. Magic Johnson  7. Larry Bird  8. Kobe Bryant  9. Shaquille O'Neal  10. Hakeem Olajuwon  11. Oscar Robertson  12. Jerry West  13. John Havlicek  14. Julius Erving  15. Scottie Pippen  16. Kevin Durant  17. Isiah Thomas  18. Wilt Chamberlain  19. Moses Malone  20. Kevin Mchale  21. Charles Barkley  22. James Harden  23. John Stockton  24. Karl Malone  25. David Robinson  There, 25."
"&gt; But when it comes to Kobe and MJ you ignore that Lebron is a better three point shooter than either of them, and arguably the goat at getting baskets on the dribble drive.  I don't ignore that, but it's disingenuous to use LeBron's 3-PT percentage against MJ and Kobe's without taking into context the era in which they played in and ignoring the fact that the difference is incredibly small.  Isiah Thomas explained it best: There are five ways to score the basketball (layup/dunk, midrange, post, 3-PT and FTs), Kobe, Michael and Bird were elite in four of the five categories while LeBron is a specialist, he is the greatest driver ever, but he is mediocre in every other area.  That's my point. Did Karl Malone average more points and shoot a better FG% than Larry Bird and Kobe Bryant, for example? Yes, but if you actually watched all of them play, are you really gonna say that Malone was as good as Kobe and Bird as scorer?  Stats are misleading, AI averages more points in the playoffs than KD and LeBron and AD averages the same amount of points with a better FG% than LeBron. If a player didn't play in exactly the same era as the other, you can't reliably use stats to say who was better.  The 80s was faster, but more physical, the 90s and 2000s were slower and physical, eras consistently change. The 2010s and 2020s are as fast as the 80s with zero physicality and record breaking 3-PT attempts, you can't simply ignore that."
Thomas Bryant used to be able to do that before he got injured. Davis Bertans sometimes does that but is hampered by nagging leg injuries. It's unfortunate to see
"Rui won't ever reach his ceiling if we continue to use him (and everybody we draft) as 3&amp;d role players to help Russ and Beal into the 12th seed on a team coached by Brooks.  These kids need shots, plays, responsibilities, and the chance to fail in order to grow. It took 4 seasons of looking like the same player before Beal took the next step. Thomas Bryant made that growth because we had 0 centers and we were forced to give him the center role, which I appreciate.  But we've also failed Troy Brown and look well on our way to failing Deni and Rui also.  Yall Heat fans need to go overtime spamming Beal and his wife's Twitter to ask for a trade."
"How about we add Dlo, Zubac, and a healthy Thomas Bryant?   Really his team is just the Pelicans but a lot deeper. Depending on the coach and the conference I think they’re around the 8th seed"
Who else do the wizards have again? Thomas Bryant?   Fuck outta here lmao
Yeah personally I don’t think Washington would accept but if they could pull it off plus Thomas Bryant that’d be a massive steal.
"Yeah, why would any team try to pluck a young, marginalized player away from the Lakers? You'd probably just end up with a fuckin bum like Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, D'Angelo Russell, Lonzo Ball, Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance, Josh Hart, David Nwaba, Thomas Bryant, Mo Wagner, Svi Mykhailiuk  or Isaac Bonga.  By the way, how's Semi Ojeleye's development coming along?"
"The youngsters showed flashes but were too inconsistent to win. Lonzo was playing well in the second half of his season with LeBron but he got hurt. BI was growing on schedule. Randle got hurt in his first game his rookie season and missed the rest of the year (that really sucked). D. Russell was let go in favor of Lonzo but there was no denying his talent. Larry Nance was an impact player, as was Thomas Bryant. Zubac, Jordan Clarkson, Josh Hart were all promising. I think the Lakers development team did its job, just that these guys were young."
"I will take team E- Isaiah Thomas(the real one), Reggie Miller, Kobe Bryant, Karl Malone and Alonzo Mourning."
Man y’all are gonna look so much better next year with a healthy Thomas Bryant and Gafford center rotation. That’s probably one of the better 1-2 punches at the 5 in the league
"Wiz fans, what do you do next season with Thomas Bryant? Legit curious"
If Thomas Bryant also doesn’t get a season ending injury I’d say they’re at least with the other eastern teams battling for fourth. I could also see them a tier above that too.
I am very excited for a future where Thomas Bryant and Daniel Gafford are playing together for the Wizards.
Exactly. Losses to guys like Thomas Bryant on top of a COVID fucked first half of the season makes this team look worse than it is
You mean the 4 games Bradley Beal missed? And Rui missed two of them?  Those 4 games?  Maybe it’s 19 games cause that’s when this team finally got over their injury plague for the most part.   Rui’s missed 15 games this season. Bradley Beal missed 10. Thomas Bryant has only played 10 games this year. Bertans has missed 17. Deni is currently out and has missed time/development.
Imagine if we had thomas bryant instead of alex len or robin lopez lol.
"If they're healthy from jump (*especially* if they still had Thomas Bryant) and they had somebody like Thibs I could absolutely see them doing what the Knicks are this year, at least."
Next years wiz gonna be lit. What do you do with Thomas Bryant? The last thing this team needs is another glass cannon lol
"It took a long time to figure out the team's roster and rotations. Westbrook was playing hurt. We lost Thomas Bryant. After the Mavs we were the team most devastated by Covid. We literally couldn't practice for 2 straight weeks because of it. We also got Gafford who fills out our center rotation.  It was a rough year but Beal obviously stayed because he saw the potential this team had. Despite him getting double and triple teamed every game he is right behind Curry is PPG.  We will be good, and we will match up well with more teams than people think because of the strong play from our centers and our good front court."
Fuck the haters we havent won this amount of games in a long time so say what you will but its working right now. This wizards team was hardly a guarantee to win over 30 games and are already over achieving for what the expectation is. We also beat tough teams this year it wasn’t just bottom barrel. Beal russ and rui have all been hurt at separate as well as overlapping periods of time. Thomas Bryant has been out for a long time and troy brown jr was hurt the entire time before he got traded. Im proud of my city and everything russ has accomplished
I think with Thomas Bryant it's just the last name
"\&gt;  Celtics are a great example lost 2 all stars same off-season and got nothing back  That's Ainge's own fault . Could've traded Kyrie at the deadline and still got a lot for him. Horford was aging who cares. Hayward they could've gotten something back in S&amp;T (Myles Turner and some other pieces iirc) but chose not too.  After KD left the Thunder they changed the CBA to incentivize players to sign early extensions. Since then most stars have either signed early or worked out a trade. Beal himself has signed multiple early extensions with DC and can sign another one this summer or next, if he declines and says he wants to hit FA then he'll be traded for value. You're making up the least likely scenario  &gt;I really like Daniel Gafford, Rui and Thomas Bryant. But aside from those I’m not sure who under 25 the wizards have whose actually good. It feels like a majority of the load is carried by a bunch of aging vets (Lopez, smith, Westbrook)  Ish Smith carrying a load, that's hilarious lol. Wash have all their 1st rd picks other than the 2023 (protected), that represents an opportunity to add young talent every year. There are worse off teams who traded away multiple future picks, like the Bulls."
"I mean plenty of players leave in free agency and their teams get nothing. Celtics are a great example lost 2 all stars same off-season and got nothing back. KD one day got up and left the Thunder. Sure sign n trades are a lot more common these days but players still leave.   I really like Daniel Gafford, Rui and Thomas Bryant. But aside from those I’m not sure who under 25 the wizards have whose actually good. It feels like a majority of the load is carried by a bunch of aging vets (Lopez, smith, Westbrook)"
Spencer Dinwiddie / Thomas Bryant
Who's fault was that? I'm a Celtics fan. You know how many GMs Danny Ainge has fleeced? We got rid of Wagner quick. Bulls didn't need Gafford anymore. They did was was best for both organizations. Thomas Bryant is out right now.
"I fixed the formatting for you lol. Looks like a good list to me, but I would have KAJ for the Lakers, maybe Wilt for GSW, maybe Dame for Portland, and I think Dr. J is the right choice for Philly, but AI makes it close.     Atlanta Hawks: Dominique Wilkins   Boston Celtics: Bill Russell ( a tough one tbh)   Brooklyn Nets: Julius Erving   Charlotte Hornets: Kenna Walker   Chicago Bulls: Michael Jordan (obvious)   Cleveland Cavaliers: LeBron James (no brainer)   Dallas Mavericks: Dirk Nowitzki   Denver Nuggets: Alex English   Detroit Pistons: Isiah Thomas   Golden State Warriors: Stephen Curry   Houston Rockets: Hakeem Olajuwon   Indiana Pacers: Reggie Miller   Los Angeles Clippers: Bob McAdoo   Los Angeles Lakers: Kobe Bryant (SUPER TOUGH)   Memphis Grizzlies: Zach Randolph (tougher than it seems   Miami Heat: Dwyane Wade   Milwaukee Bucks: Kareem Abdul Jabbar   Minnesota Timberwolves: Kevin Garnett   New Orleans Hornets/Pelicans: Chris Paul   New York Knicks: Patrick Ewing   Oklahoma City Thunder: Russell Westbrook   Orlando Magic: Dwight Howard   Philadelphia 76ers: Julius Erving   Phoenix Suns: Steve Nash   Portland Trail Blazers: Clyde Drexler   Sacramento Kings: Oscar Robertson   San Antonio Spurs: Tim Duncan (easy choice)   Toronto Raptors: Kyle Lowry   Utah Jazz: Karl Malone   Washington Wizards: Wes Unseld"
"Thomas Bryant was either the Wiz 2nd or 3rd best player last year, and he played 10 games this season before tearing his ACL.    The even bigger difference was the Bizarro-World version of Bertans that the Wiz got to start the season.  He was an abomination - shot 32% from 3 for his first 15 games, and on defense he made 2020 IT seem like Ben Wallace.    Most importantly, the Wiz were 22 games under .500 last season.  They're currently 5 games below .500, and that's in spite of Bizarro Bertans and getting crushed by covid early in the year.    All that said, you're correct, in that it remains to be seen whether Russ can stay healthy.  I think Russ has shown that he's still a top 25 player when healthy, but that last clause is carrying a lot of weight."
Thomas Bryant also went down
"We would definitely have a better record (going 0-4 against Bulls/Magic in first 5 games comes to mind) .. but   A lot of things have turned around for us to make this run  - One of the easiest schedules in the second half of the season (especially during this win streak).  - Gafford trade was a huge improvement for the team. We win a lot of games earlier in the year if Gafford is playing instead of Thomas Bryant / Mo Wagner.  - Westbrook being healthy has made a really big difference. When Westbrook was unhealthy he was missing a lot of mid range jumpers and layups. He is over criticized, but a lot of it was warranted in the first part of the season."
"Lakers scouting is crazy (thank u jesse buss), we had dozier on the summer league team a few years back w/ josh hart, moe wagner, isaac bonga and thomas bryant (all ex-lakers on other teams now).  As Lakers scouting is good, our development is trash so im happy he's shining with you guys."
I’m surprised the trade never made the front page. It was a groundbreaking deal. [Luka and a 2nd round pick for Thomas Bryant](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=yf79hdpm)
"this is a bullshit answer because arent the wizards supposed to be a bad team also ? also they did not pick their schedule. you can only play who is in front of you. going 10-2 in the nba is great no matter who you are playing. it is not easy to win in the nba, especially when you aren't a stacked team. on paper they have one of the worst supporting casts i've ever seen with thomas bryant done for the season. no one even knew who gafford was before he got to the wiz and they started winning."
Lakers should get some mention too  Zubac at 32  Kuzma at 27  Hart at 30  Thomas Bryant at 42  Svi at 47  Caruso who was undrafted  Horton Tucker at 46
"I think the Nets have done pretty well too.  They got LeVert, Allen, and Claxton with lower picks.   Also the Lakers in recent memory got Clarkson, Kuzma, Nance, Hart, Zubac, and Thomas Bryant with lower picks."
"I think it's not just Gafford.  The Wizards were already good at denying shot at the rim, opponents were just hitting a crazy amount of jumpers.  With that being said, a big question about that team future is the center position, because I'm not sure you can be a good team with Thomas Bryant as the starting center, he's just too bad defensively"
Don’t forget about Thomas Bryant
is there any chance for thomas bryant to come back?
Wizards fan - hire a new coach ASAP . In the draft identify whoever the best 3&amp;D SG/SF is in our draft position &amp; pick that dude. And add another MLE veteran wing in the offseason (guys like Garrett Temple or Trevor Ariza). Maybe see how the season starts and package Thomas Bryant + some stuff at the trade deadline for another guard or wing who shoots threes
Thomas Bryant pre-ACL injury
"They also didn't have Gafford before. He's been the best big on the roster this season, better than a healthy Thomas Bryant on both ends"
Thomas Bryant too
Thomas Bryant got hurt in December too
oh fr i didn’t know that. thomas bryant coming back should help too so next season the wizards might surprise some people
"I think part of this is that the Wizards don't have any inside defense.  Take [this quote from Gary Trent Jr](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mx4vk3/gary_trent_jr_the_west_is_completely_different/): ""[The West] is completely different from the East, it's kind of run-and-gun, it's more chucking 3's. The East is kind of grind-it-out... they'll still throw into the post... you don't really get too much of that in the West.""  The Wizards are a complete horror when it comes to inside defense. Thomas Bryant (who is not exactly a paint menace) is out for the season, and then who is their next best guy? RoLo is kind of competent but plays very few minutes.  Also defense is the side of the floor most impacted by coaching, and the Wizards have Scott Brooks.  Otoh, they have two borderline all-NBA guards. So I think their roster is kind of an anomaly too."
"Yea if Beal and Westbrook are healthy they could definitely win the play-in game and be a tough out for the top teams. They've had some exceptionally bad injury luck this year, losing Thomas Bryant earlier in the year and now Deni, with Russ, Beal, Bertans and now Rui all missing time due to injuries and various other reasons"
"Thomas Bryant, Bertans, Hachimura, Garrison Matthews, Raul Neto. Any of them."
"Wiz are far from healthy without Rui and Thomas   Bryant, and now Deni but I do like your sentiment at the end there 👍"
Dudes the best center we have had on this team since gortat in like the middle of last decade. Thomas Bryant was/is good offensively but dude couldn’t defend to save his life. Gafford actually is a actual rim protector and it’s changed our defense just enough that we can start winning these damn games we should win
"No Deni, no Thomas Bryant and no Rui recently  Wizards have the worst roster after their top 2 players and it's not even close."
"Daniel Gafford looks like the best center on the Wizards, including a healthy Thomas Bryant"
"Lets not hate on Beal now. ik wizards are the 11th seed, but Beal has been outstanding. Yes westbrook has the ability to carry the team, and he still has it, but when you look at this team, its supporting cast is worse than the 2016-17 Thunder one. I mean cmon' really? Raul Neto as your backup PG? And obviously Thomas Bryant is out for the rest of the season which is A HUGE blow to the wizards he was doing really good. Along that with Covid and you cant really say Beal is the least impactful scorer"
Why stop there? We need to include Thomas Bryant and Mo Wagner. Is Isaac Bonga still around? How about Svi Mykhailiuk?

"I had no delusions that we would get JT.   As far as drafting it's funny that's your attach considering the Lakers draft record is impeccable the past 5 years:   Ingram, Randle, Clarkson, Ball, Hart, Zubac, Thomas Bryant, THT, and more have all made massive contributions to NBA rosters."
Thomas Bryant monster dunked on his own basket
I thought Thomas Bryant did this earlier this year for the Wizards. (Not off a FT though IIRC.)
Is Thomas Bryant gonna come back? He was a weapon at the beginning of the season.
You can do 13 with Harden/PG13/Bogdan/Bam/Thomas Bryant. The 5th player is pretty tough for any combination at 13 but the four man combo of Harden/PG/Bogdan/Bam would be a foundation for an exceptional offensive and defensive team (at least on paper).
"PG- IT SG- JJ Redick SF-Norm Powell PF-Ilyosova(I think that’s right?) C- Thomas Bryant bench PG-Chris Clemons SG-Tyler Herro SF-Caris LaVert PF-Gary Clark C-Luke Kornet I had one goal, no defense. Pretty sure this team could score 200 and give up 200 points."
Don't forget Thomas Bryant!
"Imagine if it was Thomas Bryant with Gafford.  Rolo and Len are both awful. While yes Rolo hits his hook shots, he is a liability at everything else."
Imagine if it was Thomas Bryant with Gafford and Rolo off the bench instead of fucking Alex Len starting.
"Mo Wagner isn't even on an NBA team as of today  But yeah our center rotation with Thomas Bryant injured has not been great, Gafford really stepping up."
"Pelinka: Commence order 66  Wagner: Yes sir.  *Wagner turns to Nance Jr, Jordan Clarkson, Thomas Bryant, Svi, Randle, Ingram, Ball, Hart, D'lo and gives them a nod to start Order 66*"
"Really don't see that materializing .. mainly bc 1) Beal and Washington are heading towards a 5yr supermax extension in 2022 and neither party wants the trade and 2) if it came to it, GSW would need WAS to accept taking back the Wiggins contract which is negative value. They'd also have to pay Wiseman $10M/season which in the modern NBA is actually a lot of cash for a 5 who isn't appreciably better than the Thomas Bryant/Daniel Gafford rotation they have now.  With the assets Golden State has (assuming the Minn pick conveys) I think acquiring another team's franchise player is a bit optimistic but they could be in play for a high-level starter like Miles Turner , Sabonis or Jerami Grant. Grant in particular would be a great add for them imo"
"Add Clarkson, Thomas Bryant and Zubac they would be a 6- 7th seed.  I thought if this before and I feel like the Lakers would of drafted Tatum instead of Lonzo if they didn’t want to free up cap room for Dlo."
"If you add Thomas Bryant they’d be the # 4 or 5 seed in the East, #7-8 seed in the West"
It was obvious what u meant lol. It’s like those teams using those guys as an excuse. Wizards lost to 6ers cause no Thomas bryant btw full stop
yes he’s going to get traded to dc for thomas bryant and a protected second rounder  source: trust me bro
"Here's a list of all the guards who scored more ppg than John Stockton *in 1990, his career best scoring year*:  * Michael Jordan, Reggie Miller, Jeff Malone, Clyde Drexler, Tony Campbell, Kevin Johnson, Magic Johnson, Mitch Ritchmond, Mark Price, Rolando Blackman, Reggie Theus, Hersey Hawkins, Isiah Thomas, Fat Lever, Derek Harper, Danny Ainge, Joe Dumars, Terry Porter  ----  Here's a list of all the guards who scored more ppg than Chris Paul *in 2009, his career best scoring year*:  * Dwyane Wade, Kobe Bryant  So even taking into account differences in era, CP3 was clearly on another level scoring-wise relative to his peers. Bring on the next excuse"
Mozgov and Deng joined in the 2016-17 season and Thomas Bryant wasn't drafted until 2017
D'Angelo Russell   Jordan Clarkson   Kobe bryant   Luol deng   Roy Hibbert   Larry Nance JR   Tarik Black   Timofey Mozgov   Nick Young   Thomas Bryant   Julius Randle   I know I'm missing like 2-3 guys for sure
"1. I'm not down voting you, but maybe you should take the hint.   2. I'll be honest, I forgot that THJ was in Dallas because I only watch two teams: the Pistons (where Beilein now works, funnily enough) and the Nuggets. I have never cared about neither the Knicks nor the Mavericks.   3. So you can name one. Trey Burke comes off the bench for Dallas. Ignas Brazdeikis doesn't get minutes in NYC. Mo Wagner is behind *Thomas ""I score on my own basket"" Bryant* in Washington. Who even knows where Glenn Robinson III is anymore? Is he even still in the NBA?"
"&gt; if Ainge had taken better care of Thomas, would Davis have been more open to coming to Boston?  The answer is no. And you’d probably have heard someone in AD’s camp publicly frame some other reason that AD wouldn’t re-sign in Boston if a trade went through. Because that was to prevent Ainge from being able to rationalize pushing in the chips and force AD to the Lakers.   Kobe Bryant is the second best player at his position of all time behind only the man widely considered the GOAT. Who was entering his 18th year with the Lakers franchise having won 5 titles. Is your position that IT (I fucking love IT) deserved some version of what Kobe got for two   plus seasons in Boston one of which he was transcendent and a magical playoff run in a weak af conference happened? They should have asked him if he was okay with getting traded (for one of the best pgs in the league to the conference champions to compete for a ring with LeBron James) before negotiating the trade?"
"FOH delete this post. No one outside of Portland values Simon that heavily, certainly not enough to be a centerpiece in a Beal trade. We lose Thomas Bryant and Beal and we get back 2 mediocre young players and a negative contract in Kemba"
"It goes a long way to show the limited pool of players that are available, that you will take care of them.  They understand that trades are part of the game.  But with the tragedy that Thomas went through with his family, coming back to play through injury, and taking the team as far as he did - you'd expect something more than a ""Goodbye.""  The Lakers didn't need to give Kobe a huge extension after his Achilles injury. That wasn't a GM trying to improve his team. He was taking care of his player.  &gt;The final contract Kobe Bryant ever signed with the Lakers was a two-year, $48 million extension in November of 2013. The most Kobe made during a season was $30,453,805. That was back in 2013-14 when he only appeared in six games following his Achilles recovery.  There has to be some consideration given - if Ainge had taken better care of Thomas, would Davis have been more open to coming to Boston?"
"Guys off the top of my head who I can think of who were/are better than him:  1. Michael Jordan  2. Lebron James  3. Magic Johnson  4. Larry Bird  5. Wilt Chamberlain  6. Shaquille O'Neal  7. Kobe Bryant  8. Allen Iverson  9. Steph Curry  10. Isiah Thomas  11. Patrick Ewing  12. Karl Malone  13. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar/Lew Alcindor  14. Dominique Wilkins  fiftennn ice trae  Sorry, my Tourettes kicked in at the end there.  So uh, no, not top 15, and certainly not top 10."
"He does all the intangibles of something you hate when hes your opponent with all the petty things he does. He tossed the ball at schroeders head, threw thomas bryant to the ground for no reason, and probably a bunch more shit you laugh at if hes on your team"
"&gt;Washington desperately needs a five, as we saw Gafford, Lopez and Len get abused this series against Philly.   I mean, against Embiid, yeah.  So would Nurkic.  Against everyone else they were actually pretty decent defending the paint.  &gt;Wizards get: Jusif Nurkic Blazers get: Davis Bertans, Deni Advija  lol no thanks.  we just lost our only shooter and only wing.  Maybe if it's for Thomas Bryant instead, but portland probably wouldn't want that."

"&gt;It would be Lebron, Kuzma, Caruso, THT, DLo, Josh Hart, Ingram, Nance, Lonzo, Randle, Clarkson and Thomas Bryant; rest would be guys on the min.  You forgot:  * De'Andre Hunter, the #4 overall pick who they traded for Davis * Ivica Zubac, who they traded to make room for Davis * Moe Wagner, who they traded for Davis * Isaac Bonga, who they traded for Davis * Jemarrio Jones, who they also traded for Davis -- but is a G Leaguer who makes no difference, just mentioning him for completeness  &gt;Very thin on big men  Not so thin when you include Zubac, and to a lesser degree Wagner.  If they somehow had all those players, they'd have the deepest roster in the league by far.  Hunter and Zubac both routinely start for playoff teams, and you didn't even include them.  Their bench would be a playoff team in the East.  The huge challenge would be finding minutes for everyone, and getting all these players to mesh offensively -- both are which are parts of coaching that Frank Vogel struggles terribly with.  Luckily for Vogel, with the most talent in the league, there would probably be many good choices on how to play them, so he might accidentally stumble across a few excellent lineups."
"I mean, they did scout talent...they just traded it away.   DLo, Randle, Hart, BI, Lonzo, Zubac, Thomas Bryant, etc"
"Well i never said the wizards are as good as the nets, lol. but the moves that make the most basketball sense when you look at them on paper often aren't the most conducive plans for success. all those moves i mentioned before made so much basketball sense and they ended up being fucking dog shit moves that set teams and players back substantially in terms of their plans for championship contention.  despite how you feel about the wiz i think they actually do have some really nice young players moving forward like Avdija, Gafford, Thomas Bryant and Hachimura who could all develop into being a great supporting cast for a star player on a team that consistently gets to the playoffs.  If Beal jumped ship i wouldn't necessarily blame him, but if he stayed i wouldn't sit back and be like ""lol, Beal, this makes no basketball sense, what're u doing???"" because it's as good a move as any as long as he's where he thinks he should be."
"&gt; Commit to him so you can perpetually be in the play-in game or a bottom playoff seed?  I just do not get this. So you want the other 26 NBA teams to just give up and roll over before the season starts?  Shit, so much of a playoff run is LUCK. If Embiid got hurt and the Wizards still had a hot Bertans and maybe guy like Thomas Bryant, we might be looking a more evenly matched team.  Kawhi's Raptors run was largely in part to luck. People did not have them winning it all. I'd argue the Cavs title run was also in large part in luck - Draymond's suspensions? All the injured teams they faced?  The Heat in the bubble. Like...you legitimately never know what can happen.  So you commit to a former MVP who looked like his MVP-self when healthy. And you commit to a young guy who wants to be MVP. and you put savvy veterans around them and a better coaching staff.   Heck yes."
Thomas Bryant being hurt was one of the main reason why they got so much better defensively tho
"Bertans, Thomas Bryant, and filler for Kristaps.  Mavs get a sharpshooter and developing big, Wizards get a big three."
They could have totally used Thomas Bryant throughout the season. He could have been a difference maker and get them an extra W against the Sixers.
do the wizards try to trade thomas bryant in the offseason since Gafford seems like a  promising young guy.
We are missing 3 starters in Thomas Bryant and Deni Advija ... they both have big weaknesses in their game ... but the talent is there.
They're definitely gonna need Thomas Bryant to sub in and pick up a few fouls later on.
"Next year, if they fire Brooks and hire a nice development coach like Kenny Atkinson, I think they could actually improve a lot and contend for a 4/5 seed. They would run out a lineup of Westbrook, Beal, Deni, Rui, and Thomas Bryant, which lacks in defense but isn't bad by any means. Brooks misuses Deni as a spot up and doesn't allow him to facilitate or playmake which hurts them a bit. Off the bench, they have some solid young defensive talent in Garrison Matthews and Daniel Gafford. Bertans could always bounce back from a bad year. They need to acquire some solid role players to fill out the bench.  Even despite these improvements, I also think their ceiling to me is a first or second round exit. Team lacks defense and Westbrook will always be a bit to a clunky fit. Logic would say they should blow it up now and get a haul for Beal, but I'm assuming the Wizards will hesitate to trade their star, who actively wants to stay in Washington. I'm just posing a scenario on which they could improve, but I doubt they ever reach contender status"
 Thomas Bryant is 23 and had a good start but got injured after 10 games. Did you just overlook him or is he also in the trash group to you?
"Keep in mind, the wizards are missing 2 starters in Thomas Bryant and Deni Advija.     If Beal wants to be a Wizard for life .. you can just wait out Westbrook's contract.    - Next 2 years you make the playoffs to build a winning culture.  - Summer 2023 Westbrook's contract is up and Hachimura would be due for an extension. You have the cap space the sign a max player.   - Beal will be 30 going in the 23-24 Season, so still in his prime.   - Hachimura would 25 with a couple more years to develop. His offense is decent right now, and his 3pt shot has been improving. He can make a Tobias Harris like leap. His defense does need a lot of work.   - Advija will be 22. He showed glimpses of being a solid role player this year, he was in his rookie year with a terrible coach. With a decent coach he will develop into a good player. He's got good fundamentals and just needs to work on his 3pt shot.    - Thomas Bryant will be 26. He's a really good offensive center. He's shot 40% from 3 the last couple years. His defense is bad though and something he'll need to work on. Gafford is the opposite of Bryant .. good at everything Bryant is bad at ... but both play with high energy.     - The big question would be whether or no they could get another big piece with the max contract slot. Last time it didn't work when Beal got his first extension ( spent a max slot on Ian Mahinmi, Andrew Nicholson, and  Jason Smith)."
"Wizards need some help fleshing out that roster. That’s a really great backcourt they’ve got, but when the best member of your supporting cast is a very young and inexperienced Rui Hachimura, it doesn’t bode well for your team’s chances.  Think with Thomas Bryant coming back next season hopefully fully recovered, and if they can somehow snag a decent prospect outside of the lottery, they could be better set for the future."
clearly never seen Thomas Bryant playing defense
"I think they have some good young pieces they should keep like Rui,Deni and and Thomas Bryant but other than them yeah I'd sweep clean."
Better than Thomas Bryant getting clowned on and throwing a fit I guess lol
"You think Thomas Bryant would be pretty legit in the time frame?   Everytime I watched him, he was beasting, until he got hurt. Dude looks like Bynum who can shoot 3s"
"Thomas Bryant, Isaac Bonga, Svi Mykhailiuk, and Moe Wagner have also been varying levels of good, especially considering their draft spots."
"For me the only relatively tough Decision is leaving Thomas Bryant, but i’m not taking him over any of these guys."
I’ll be interested to see how it works with Thomas Bryant coming back. I like them both tbh.
"Yeah Chicago giving us him in that trade was phenomenal for us, especially since he's on a great contract and we have salary cap issues haha (not to mention our starting Center, Thomas Bryant, is out for the year with an ACL injury)"
"I am going to skip a few sections where our remaining disagreements, if any, are unimportant.  &gt;I think this isn't really fair to mchale. IDK if he had a manu situation going on or what, but he had all-star seasons where he was 2nd on the celtics in MPG (behind bird), but he still came off the bench.   By '85 or so, McHale was a very good player.  In '81, though, he was a completely replaceable bench plug.  He didn't start for most of his career because he simply was not good enough.  He was a late-bloomer.  If he's not lucky enough to be drafted by Boston, he'd be long-since forgotten, and wouldn't have most of those All-star selections, either.  &gt;Are there any other high-profile examples of draftee forcing his way to a team?  Draftees with that leverage are extremely rare. I'm frankly amazed that Bryant pulled it off, since he was a very raw 18 year-old at the time.  Jerry West saw things in him that, frankly, no one else did.  The existence of the ABA provided players with significant leverage for a few years, but other than that, I cannot think of anyone who successfully pulled a Kobe before Kobe.  &gt;They still won 3 titles without robinson in duncan's prime. Even that first one in '99, robinson was way past his peak.  Robinson's prime was arguably as-good as anyone's, so while past it in '99 he was still easily the best player on that team.  In the Finals, with Ewing injured, the Knicks had a world-class defender in Marcus Camby, and Kurt Thomas and Larry Johnson -- neither known for defending anything.  They put Camby on Robinson, out of necessity, and took their chances with the two smaller players on Duncan.  That was a recurring theme until Robinson retired -- after which, Duncan's numbers plummet across the board, since he no longer regularly faced undersized opponents -- luckily for him, he had an array of All-star guards.  Duncan's inefficient 17 ppg wasn't sniffing a ring otherwise.  &gt;I said in my first comment in this thread, I also think the cavs getting 7 years (ignoring the return in 2015) of lebron is a huge vindication of tanking.  There's a difference between tanking and just being bad.  I don't believe Cleveland has ever needed to try to be bad.  &gt;wtf are the small markets supposed to do?  Exactly what Miami did in 2006.  And Dallas in 2011.  And Toronto in 2019.  And for that matter, Golden State pre-Durant.  Draft well -- which does not require having top 3 picks. Sign useful veterans to reasonable contracts.  Hire a competent coach.  Develop the players you draft.  Win enough to make them believe you are capable of winning more, and make them desirous to be part of that. Then, when a star becomes available on the trade market, as they often do, pounce, and profit.  The model is there.  It's been proven.  It is not easy.  If it were easy, none of us or them would care who wins.  ""We choose to do these things, not because they are easy, but because they are haaaahd."" - JFK"
Did you lose hope in Thomas Bryant? Because before his injuries I thought he was a nice piece for you guys.
"If you’re Washington, are you starting Thomas Bryant or Daniel Gafford next year at center?"
"Thomas Bryant got hurt so I think they chose Len over Lopez, for some reason. My final answer is Scott Brooks"
Thomas Bryant tore his ACL but he didn’t literally die
"It's kinda incredible how bad that Wizards roster is.   They surround Russ and Beal by starting Raul Neto and Alex Len.. Like why does Len even play when they have Robin Lopez and Daniel Gafford?   Ish Smith, who has played for 11 teams, was their best player off the bench.  Rui is okay but they could have had Herro, Thybulle, PJ Washington, or Brandon Clarke.  They drafted Deni Avdjia last year when they probably should have picked Haliburton since he fell.   I guess they're hoping Thomas Bryant and Deni come back.."
"No chance lol, all of that is gone now with their current playstyle. Here's an actual quote regarding that exact issue:  &gt;Russell Westbrook on the key to getting Garrison Mathews and Davis Bertans more shots throughout the game: **""I don't know…We're not running around trying to get them open shots, so whenever they get their shots, they get them and then they'll shoot them.""**  [https://twitter.com/FredKatz/status/1379262215820357632](https://twitter.com/FredKatz/status/1379262215820357632)  (I am holding out hope the offense can be better next year with Thomas Bryant back as a DHO big man, and a new coach)"
Sad thing is this would've been true even if they're starting center Thomas Bryant hadn't gone out for the season.
bruh Thomas Bryant lookin' thiccccc
Don't forget Thomas Bryant will be there too next season
"Kobe to the Bulls for Luol Deng, Tyus Thomas, Ben Gordon and rookie Joakim Noah in 2007  [https://www.blogabull.com/2016/4/13/11421692/kobe-bryant-trade-chicago-bulls-luol-deng](https://www.blogabull.com/2016/4/13/11421692/kobe-bryant-trade-chicago-bulls-luol-deng)  As a Laker fan that gives me cold sweats.  Deng was still four or so years away from his sole 2 all star games.  Gordon was out of the league began his slow descent out of the league a season or two later  Joakim Noah was still 6 or 7 years away from DPOY Noah.  So we just settled for paying the washed version of Luol Deng more money than god to not pay for us instead."
"I don’t know who the usual 11 are but I’d say Jordan, Lebron, Kareem, Magic, Bird, Wilt, Russell, Duncan, Bryant, Hakeem, Shaq, West, Durant, Moses, Robertson are clearly better.  Then I’d say you could easily make arguments for guys like Baylor, Dr J, Pippen, Isiah Thomas and Bob Pettit.  Probably a handful more that I’m forgetting.  I hadn’t really put much thought in it, but #20 give or take a few seems right."
I made one on another topic a few days ago when someone was outraged that Wade is not universally acknowledged as a top20 all-time player.  * Michael Jordan * LeBron James * Kareem * Magic Johnson * Larry Bird * Tim Duncan * Wilt Chamberlain * Shaquille O'Neal * Kobe Bryant * Oscar Robertson * Hakeem Olajowun * Kevin Durant * Bill Russell * Julius Erving * Stephen Curry * Dirk Nowitzki * Kevin Garnett * Moses Malone * Karl Malone * Jerry West * Dwyane Wade * Steve Nash * Charles Barkley * Kawhi Leonard * Scottie Pippen * James Harden * Elgin Baylor * Isiah Thomas * David Robinson * Chris Paul  That's a quick and dirty top30. Who does Westbrook replace?
But Thomas Bryant and Shaq Harrison have never played together
"That small blurb almost downplays what has happened to us.   We started 0-5, Thomas Bryant tears his ACL 10 games into the season, Westbrook is playing on a torn quad, we don't play for 2 weeks because of COVID, after those two weeks it's just Brad and a bunch of G Leaguers, and at one point we're 17-32. Then, very suddenly, Russ pretty much says ""We're not losing"" and now we're here."
I think they'd be at least 4th in the east if they started with a healthy westbrook + thomas bryant and the chemistry they have right now. Way better than their record would indicate for sure
"It’s not that puzzling. Bertans &amp; Westbrook were playing hurt, Thomas Bryant tore his ACL 10 games in, we couldn’t play a game for 2 weeks because of COVID, and when we came back it was just Beal and G Leaguers playing for a week or 2 after that. It basically took until just before the ASB for things to come back to normal for this team."
Thomas Bryant went down at a crucial time. Covid hit the team really bad.
"Offense - Russ, Brad, Rui, Bertans, Thomas Bryant  Defense - Gafford is the only non-embarrassment. Maybe Neto sometimes?"
1. Michael Jordan  2. Magic Johnson  3. Kobe Bryant  4. Stephen Curry  5. Oscar Robertson  6. Jerry West  7. Dwyane Wade  8. Isiah Thomas  9. James Harden  10. Jason Kidd
So happy for the Wiz.  All feels right basketball wise at least.  Healthy Deni and Thomas Bryant.

"Ranking just on current seedings   1. Sixers 2. Nets 3. Bucks 4. Hawks 5. Heat 6. Celtics  I feel confident these 6 teams are better than the Bulls, leaving just two spots. I think it would be likely to favor the Knicks with their monstrous cap space and success with young guys last year. Wizards ended the season 17-6, played all year without Thomas Bryant, added Gafford at the end, had Westbrook recovering from injury for like 40 games, young guys like Avdija and Rui should improve. I think it's reasonable to have them favored over Bulls. That already is 8 teams.   Charlotte should be in the mix, Hornets had Melo and Hayward miss a good chunk of time. Should they add any Center to their roster they improve by a good bit, and Melo is poised for a big second year leap in addition to improvement of Bridges, PJ, Monk, etc. Indiana always lurks around 40 wins it feels like.   Bulls should be in the mix, but playoffs at least seems like a bit much imo"
"But I so badly want a Westbrook/Simmons/Rui/Deni lineup where the only spacing offered is by our 3 point shooting center, Thomas Bryant."
"Let’s give some context.   They drafted Kuzma late, solid pick  They drafted BI with the second pick one before Jaylen Brown, mediocre pick and he wasn’t productive until the Lakers traded him to a team with a real development staff  They drafted Lonzo with the second pick, one ahead of Jayson Tatum, bad pick  Thomas Bryant, similar to Ingram was good when he went to a team with a real development staff, fine pick  Randle, was a bust until last year where he continued to fizzle out in the playoffs. Drafted ahead of LaVine. okay pick, before last year would’ve been considered a terrible pick  Moe Wagner, dude fucking sucks, why are you  including him  THT, you guys hype this kid up wayyyy too much, he’s a good pick, definitely not as good as Lakers fans say he was  Zubac, I mean he’s fine, I guess."
"The Lakers have drafted Kuzma, BI, Lonzo, Thomas Bryant, DLO, Julius Randle, Moe Wagner, THT, Zubac in recent years. There’s a few more I’m forgetting but we had a really great stretch of drafting from 2015-2020"
"Born in the state of NY and not necessarily in the city the Knicks get Kemba, Mitchell, Huerter, Tobias, and Thomas Bryant. Isaac, Drummond, Taj, Melo and Danny Green off the bench."
"I'm hoping the Wizards will. They'll be getting their starting center Thomas Bryant back who put up solid numbers before his acl injury and Rui Hachimura could be on track for a breakout season, and of course they have a great backcourt with Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal leading the way"
"I think a team of   Randle, Lonzo, Ingram, Dlo, Clarkson, Hart, Kuzma, Caruso, THT, Zubac, Thomas Bryant, Mykhailiuk  is enough to be at worst 7-8 seed every year for the next 10 years with a lot of upside  That team fills every need and would have some amazing chemistry. The skill isn’t a championship contender at this point in their careers but all these players are like 26 and younger"
Hmmm Davis Bertans and Thomas Bryant for Kristaps Porzingis.
"Duncan did have a soft decline in mobility in 2008. His steepest permanent decline to that point in his career and one most evident in his movement on defense. 2006 would show a statistical decline but it was driven by injury.  Ginobili was playing injured in the playoffs despite outwardly downplaying the impact it would have on him. He undoubtedly played much worse, inconsistent, and an over-reliance for the first time in his career on shooting rather than driving.  The Spurs best role players, Finley Bowen Horry and Barry were all in their final declining seasons in the league. Finley and Bowen fought off such decline well enough from 07 to 08, particularly Finley, but Horry and Barry were notably losing their mobility and playability on the defensive end. Horry suffering even more from an offensive decline than any of them. It helped Bowen he couldn’t decline that much to start on offense.  Udokah and Thomas provided worse minutes in what would have otherwise been predominantly Horry minutes the previous 04-07 playoff runs.   Nesterovic Elson Mohammed and Oberto at times would have also manned some of those minutes from 04-07 and also not produced as highly as Horry did in the same time frame, but Udokah and Thomas were nonetheless mostly receiving minutes as a result of Horry’s greater time spent manning the bench in the 08 playoffs.  Most of these same problems that cut at them in 2008 worsened even more in 09. Tim declining again in mobility, Manu going from playing injured in 08 playoffs to out entirely in the 09 playoffs, the role players suffering from even worse decline or replacements.  If Manu was healthier I think it’s fair to say the Spurs would have still been the favorite or best team in the league alongside the Celtics. Mostly a result of his underperformance (and however much injury-fueled) along with declines from Tim and role players, the Spurs weren’t as good in 08 as they were from 05-07. They may have still been better than the 04 team (probably) and were certainly better than the 09 Spurs who suffered from all the problems the 08 team did but worse so.  There is a lot of context you could add to make any of the Spurs championships feel worse or less valuable when you dig into their opponents’ health or performance. The Lakers missed a lot of their role players and Shaq declining probably in part to complacency in 2003. The Lakers weren’t as good that year as the previous 3 years. The Lakers weren’t as good in 1999 as 2000-2002. Kobe was developing in 1999 and the Lakers had injury-sourced problems in 2003.   I think a lot of the problems of disagreements here stems from how much importance is placed on team results to compare individual players. Kobe Bryant wasn’t any worse or any less the MVP in 2008 because the Spurs weren’t as good as the previous 3 years. Don’t find it weird or to be of some hidden motive that someone would say the Spurs were worse a year after a title. The Heat weren’t as good in 2014 as 2013 and I didn’t think the Heat played as well in 2013 as they did 2012. I don’t live in fear someone’s gonna tell me the Spurs didn’t play the best version of the Heatles. What hope is there for being a fan of the sport if even after your team wins multiple championships you have to argue and stress over context behind what was more or less indicative of a single player’s value?"
"I'll defend Kostas here. His offensive game is a no man's land...he kind of wants to play like he's a 7-foot guard in the style of KD or KP but doesn't have the handle or the shooting. He doesn't have the body to play in the post either. BUT...if he just stuck to being a rim running center like Javale McGee and a shot protector on defense he might be rosterable in the NBA. He has great defensive timing on his blocked shots. I mostly watched the condensed G-League highlights so I can't say what his half court man defense in like, but I was impressed by what I did see. He reminded me a lot of Thomas Bryant when he was with the Lakers' G League team and he ended up being a solid rotational player."
"You said I hate him for his cornrows, implying I'm racist.     Michael Jordan   Kareem Abdul-Jabbar   LeBron James   Magic Johnson   Hakeem Olajuwan   Bill Russell   Kobe Bryant   Larry Bird   Tim Duncan   Shaquille O'Neal   Wilt Chamberlain   David Robinson   Charles Barkley   Moses Malone   Karl Malone   Isiah Thomas   Patrick Ewing   Oscar Robertson   Dirk Nowitzki   Dwyane Wade   John Stockton   Kevin Garnett   Jerry West   Julius Erving   Kevin Durant   Steve Nash   Chris Paul   Scottie Pippen   Stephen Curry\[  Elgin   Hondo    Who is he better than?"

"I said 15 years. Collison, Rivers, Hield is not good enough when it comes to drafting and developing. Rivers was a disaster early on. Where are the bench players. Where are the guys who signed their rookie extension and stayed 7 years? It's not there. Meanwhile we got Kuzma, Hart, Zubac, Nance, THT, Thomas Bryant, Svi, D'Lo, Ingram, Ball (serviceable player now), Randle, Clarkson. All of them worked out and they needed to be good to be used as trade bait.   And that's just the last 6 years. See the difference."
Westbrook + Bertans + Thomas Bryant for Simmons and Tobias
They would have DLo if they never traded him? Randle was actually pretty good his final year on the Lakers definitely was showing promise . They would also hAve Thomas Bryant as backup center and Svi whatever his name is . I think they would be a decent team for sure . Yes the player development for the Lakers is shit i do agree . I’ve followed all these guys since the baby Lakers days
Yes and no. We had the 28th pick and traded for the 27th. It’s extremely unlikely Kuzma gets picked exactly 27th if we’re not making the pick so we probably nab him at 28 anyway.  The difference is we couldn’t also trade down 28th to get Hart and Thomas Bryant.  So we could have had D-Lo and Kuz. Just not also Hart and Bryant.
"They'd be a solid playoff team and then get fucked by the cap after they have to overpay like half of them.  If you want more C depth, you can add Thomas Bryant to the list. Idk if he'd have been let go if they didn't try to go win now with LeBron."
"They were bad last year but I think they dealt with the most or close to the most covid disruptions than any other team in the league and it wasn't until they made their run at the end of the year where they finally had a consistent run with their main guys all there. They also lost Thomas Bryant who was their starting center a couple games into the season which force them to play a lot of Alex Len and Robin Lopez before they got Gafford.    I think they'll probably convince themselves that with more health luck, getting Bryant back and maybe making a couple depth acquisitions on the wing that they could be higher up maybe like the 5 or 6 seed which maybe isn't great but for them might be worth just running it back with Beal and Russ."
And don't forget about Thomas Bryant.
"1. Usage - players that play more and make more explosive movements are more likely to get hurt 2. Exposure - you're more likely to hear about a star player getting hurt, even if it happens at the same rate as role players  For the Wizards, people talked about Russ getting healthy all season, while ignoring that we had lost Thomas Bryant, Deni Avdija, and (for stretches) Rui Hachimura"
"Lakers - AD, LeBron (played through injury)  Nuggets - Murray, Barton  Clippers - Kawhi, Morris (played through injury), Zubac, Ibaka (out for series)  76ers - Embiid (played through injury), Danny Green  Hawks - Trae, Hunter, Reddish, Bogdanovic (played through injury)  Bucks - Giannis, DiVincenzo (out for series)  Knicks - Robinson  Nets - Kyrie, Harden (played through injury), Jeff Green  Jazz - Conley, Mitchell (played through injury)  Mavs - Luka (played through injury)  Heat - Oladipo  Celtics - Jaylen, Kemba  Wizards - Avdija, Thomas Bryant, Bertans  Suns - Payne, CP3 (played through)"
"He was drafted and loved the same Lakers scouting department that drafted gems like Kuzma, Thomas Bryant, Zubac, Josh Hart, Julius Randle, and Larry Nance later in the draft. Or the fact that Frank Vogel who is one of the smartest coaches in league love him. Or he’s being developed by Phil Handy the best development coach in the league that has specifically worked with Kawhi, Lebron, Kyrie, Kobe, Kyle Lowry, and Anthony Davis. Or the fact that he rates in the 96th percentile according the Basketball Index in his getting to the rim rating. Or the fact he’s getting personally mentored by Lebron. There’s definitely a chance for the kid to succeed but have fun with your day."
"Honestly, my posts all weekend were lazy because I shut my laptop off after I end my work week and I *really* don't like having to turn it back on, and looking this stuff up takes more than twice as long on my tablet or phone.  So anyway....... I showed you a league history indicating teams in their 30s don't win rings very often, and 40 years of most-valuable-player-on-title-teams being in their 20s. You showed me outliers. Every player we're looking at is exceptional, so if these guys don't indicate players tend to be in their primes in their 30s, some outlier performances aren't going to sway me.  Additionally - you keep pointing out that guys that are 29 tend to be more successful than guys who are 26... That in no way invalidates my point. If anything IT SUPPORTS it. It makes complete sense that guys will more often be at the peak of their powers at the tail end of their prime, combining the fact that they are still in their peak athletic form with their increased basketball IQ/skill level. That doesn't mean they're still peaking in their 30s, because the numbers I've shown you indicate that guys in their 30s clearly don't lead championship teams nearly as often as guys in their 20s, on around a 2:1 level.  You've brought up Finals MVP a bunch, so lets look at that. I'll also look back on the previous list I posted to see who is a top complementary player, and what age their top complementary players were if these are the primary stars. I'll use PLAYOFF Win Shares to determine this. So this whole list is composed of 1. the Finals MVP and 2. the top performer on the team other than the Finals MVP in terms of playoff win shares.  Pre-prime (under 26): 16  Prime (26-29): 38  Post-prime (30 over): 26  Players in their 20s in general are represented at over 2:1 - 54 to 26. On top of the previous data showing the most valuable player in a full season (my point regarding prime) is 26-29 at a 2:1 rate, and the fact that weighted by minutes only 9 championship teams all time have been over 30.  In addition - you've got multiple long stretches where guys in their 20s dominate the list, while there's really only one period where guys in their 30s dominate it: 1994-1998 where 9/10 players are in their 30s. Outside of that stretch players in their 20s crush the players in their 30s by a score of 53-17.  2020 - Lebron James, age 35 (compl. to Anthony Davis, age 26)  2019 - Kawhi Leonard, 27 (compl. is Kyle Lowry, 32)  2018 - Kevin Durant, 29 (compl. is Draymond Green, 27)  2017 - Kevin Durant, 28 (compl. to Steph Curry, 28)  2016 - Lebron James, 31 (compl. is Kyrie Irvin, 23)  2015 - Andre Iguodala, 31 (compl. to Steph Curry, 26)  2014 - Kawhi Leonard, 22 (compl. to Tim Duncan, 37)  2013 - Lebron James, 28 (compl. is Chris Bosh, 28)  2012 - Lebron James, 27 (compl. is Dwyane Wade, 30)  2011 - Dirk Nowitzki, 32 (compl. is Tyson Chandler, 28)  2010 - Kobe Bryant, 31 (compl. to Pau Gasol, 29)  2009 - Kobe Bryant, 30 (compl. is Pau Gasol, 28)  2008 - Paul Pierce, 30 (compl. to Kevin Garnett, 31)  2007 - Tony Parker, 24 (compl. to Tim Duncan, 30)  2006 - Dwyane Wade, 24 (compl. is James Posey, 29)  2005 - Tim Duncan, 28 (compl. to Manu Ginobili, 27)  2004 - Chauncey Billups, 27 (compl. is Ben Wallace, 29)  2003 - Tim Duncan, 26 (compl. is David Robinson, 37)  2002 - Shaquille O'Neal, 29 (compl. is Kobe Bryant, 23)  2001 - Shaquille O'Neal, 28 (compl. to Kobe Bryant, 22)  2000 - Shaquille O'Neal, 27 (compl. is Kobe Bryant, 21)  1999 - Tim Duncan, 22 (compl. is David Robinson, 33)  1998 - Michael Jordan, 34 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 32)  1997 - Michael Jordan, 33 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 31)  1996 - Michael Jordan, 32 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 30)  1995 - Hakeem Olajuwon, 32 (compl. to Clyde Drexler, 32)  1994 - Hakeem Olajuwon, 31 (compl. is Robert Horry, 23)  1993 - Michael Jordan, 29 (compl. is Horace Grant, 27)  1992 - Michael Jordan, 28 (compl. is Horace Grant, 26)  1991 - Michael Jordan, 27 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 25)  1990 - Isiah Thomas, 28 (compl. is Bill Laimbeer, 32)  1989 - Joe Dumars, 25 (compl. is Isiah Thomas, 27)  1988 - James Worthy, 26 (compl. to Magic Johnson, 28)  1987 - Magic Johnson, 27 (compl. is James Worthy, 25)  1986 - Larry Bird, 29 (compl. is Kevin McHale, 28)  1985 - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 37 (compl. to Magic Johnson, 25)  1984 - Larry Bird, 27 (compl. is Kevin McHale, 26)  1983 - Moses Malone, 27 (compl. is Maurice Cheeks, 26)  1982 - Magic Johnson, 22 (compl. is Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 34)  1981 - Cedric Maxwell, 25 (compl. to Larry Bird, 24)"
Thomas Bryant is a beast
"...It's cause you got him from the Lakers lol. If he were traded from the Wizards to ya'll you wouldn't care. He was not a good Laker and hasn't shown much besides flashes.   Out of the two young Lakers centers Magic exiled, I would prefer Thomas Bryant to Zubac."
True but the Wizards also absolutely murdered us (I think it was without Westbrook and Thomas Bryant). Also the Pistons completed a 30 point comeback or some shit on us too.
"I also have no idea what the Spurs would want that the Wizards would give up. Do the Spurs really want Bertans back so badly they’ll deal with his contact? Would the Wizards give up Deni, Rui, or even Thomas Bryant for DeRozan?"
"Not an anthony bennet-level bust, but yeah hes been pretty dissapointing. Ironically his offensive game is leagues better than his defense, which is the opposite of what people thought he would be. I think hes a thomas bryant-esque backup big for the rest of his career"
"60s: Bill Russell and the Celtics dominants the decade winning 9/10. Wilt Chamberlain sets amazing records unbroken to this day.    Important players: Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, Elgin Baylor and Jerry West  70s: Rough decade, several teams win championships. Kareem emerges as the best player.   Important players: Kareem Abdul Jabar, Pete Maravich, John Havelick, Julius Erving and Oscar Robertson  80s: NBA starts to become more popular. Celtics and Lakers, led by Larry Bird and Magic Johnson respectively, win most of the titles in the decade finished off by the Detroit Pistons winning back to back. Michael Jordan, a young shooting guard from Chicago, is seen as a basketball phenom.   Important players: Kareem Abdul Jabar, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Moses Malone, Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Isaiah Thomas  90s: The decade belongs to Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. With his high flying moves, incredible defense and an unmatched determination, They win 6 championships, including three straight twice. Michael Jordan is regarded as the best basketball player to ever play. Hakeem Olajuwon wins a couple in the middle of the 90s, arguably best defensive player of all time.   important players: Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Hakeem Olajuwon, Karl Malone, John Stockton, Reggie Miller and Shaquille O’Neal  00s: Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal win 3 straight for the Lakers as an amazing duo.

Not to be denied, the Spurs and the Dallas Mavericks beat Lebron’s Heat. In 2013, a point guard named Stephen Curry begins to change how basketball is played by shooting three point shots at an efficiency, difficulty level and volume that broke defenses. Armed with a lethal shot and an amazing team with Klay Thompson and Draymomd Green, Stephen Curry led the Golden State Warriors to 5 straight championships, winning 3. Kevin Durant joined the warriors in 2016, after losing to Currys Warriors, and to the dismay of many NBA fans, helped the warriors win the final two championships they won in decade.   Important players: Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russel Westbrook, Chris Paul and Giannis Antetekumpo."
I’d say wait to see what your current set up can do first. They lost Thomas Bryant early and had Alex Len starting a lot of the year so that’s pretty terrible. And Deni missed some time. Get a healthy year of the triple double king and one of the best scorers in the NBA with some good help and see first before blowing it up.
if you add thomas bryant to that lineup we might just take home the gold
"Centers have been our downfall in general since the Kobe Era.  Mozgov - no explanation needed  Then we went on to draft Zubac, Thomas Bryant, and Mo Wagner, all of whom are at least passable, and could do the job of keeping AD from getting banged up at the 5. Failed to retain any of them.  Got Javale Mcgee, Dwight Howard, Brook Lopez as free agents. Brook especially could've been such a huge difference-maker for a healthy Lakers team. A center who can space the floor along with LeBron and AD would've been so great. Failed to retain any of them.  We've managed to hold on to some great forwards, including maybe the greatest ever, we've had passable guards, but we've failed time and time again at the 5."
"Eeeh, you don't need ""playmaking"" in the NBA, you need ""spacing"".  If players have gravity, things start to open up. Beal's the type where you gotta double him and stack the paint too. That's how last year Bertans got so many damn looks even though they had no point guard or traditional ""playmakers""....and their offense was ~top 3. Bringing in Russ and losing Thomas Bryant though led to just a clogged offense in 2021.   Pairing Beal with Tatum and Brown would just be ridiculous. Each of those guys would have ~4-6 assists probably."
So excited for Thomas Bryant to come back.
"You missed the part where Kuzma, KCP, Harrell, Kispert, and Thomas Bryant enter the scene. And Avdija returns for his 2nd year after spending the second half of last year on the IR. All are brand new variables he didn't have to deal with last year."
"I like the wizards in the playoffs based off two things mainly.  One being that Rui takes the next step in becoming a consistent iso scorer, while maintaining the spurts of high level defense he showed last season. He's a walking mismatch that can defend 2-4, and has a good combo of size and handles/speed to be a threat with his mid range and post game.  Secondly, Thomas Bryant has to come back strong with his offensive game and floor spacing, while also somehow becoming not the worst defensive big in the game. I doubt he is ever a great defender, but just not complete liability is enough with his offensive game to be serviceable with a guy like Gafford switching with him depending on matchups."
Thomas Bryant and Rondo.
"Lou Williams wasn't traded for the pick that became Kyle Kuzma. Kuzma was part of the Mozgov/D'Lo trade with Brooklyn. Lou Williams was traded for a pick that was then traded to Utah for the picks that were used on Josh Hart and Thomas Bryant.  Trading Lou Williams was also not a ""tanking"" move. It did make the Lakers worse in the short term, but Lou Williams was much older than the rest of the young core, and was seen at the time as someone they should probably try to get something for before he went downhill with age. Ironically he went on to play probably the best ball of his career after that in his early 30s, but that was unexpected.   That trade was about getting a 1st round pick for Lou while he still had time left on his contract rather than thinking the Lakers were too good with him (they were horribly bad either way). When the Lakers traded Lou they were 19-39 and [had just been trashed by an awful Suns team, losing by 36 points.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201702150PHO.html) At the rate the Lakers were winning with Lou (32% of the time), that put them on a 26 win pace with him. Without him they finished the season with 26 wins, meaning they were no worse without him.   The Lou Williams trade was not done by Mitch and Jim, as they'd just been fired, but rather was the first move from Magic and Pelinka, as they began the process of trying to dig the Lakers out of the hole Mitch and Jim had put the team in. The Lakers were awful and capped out when Mitch and Jim were fired. 18 months later they were a 35 win team with two max cap slots. The Lakers were just really awful under Mitch and Jim, even though they were trying to be good."
"A few Laker related ones people always get wrong :  Mike Bibby was not called for a foul when elbowed by Kobe, Doug Christie was.  Kobe in 2001 playoffs did not only go off because he was the 2nd option and “every one triple teamed Shaq”. In fact, the Lakers were significantly better with Kobe and no Shaq than the opposite.  Similarly, AD didn’t have an insane playoff run in 2020 because “he was spoonfed by LeBron”. In fact his scoring volume and efficiency were higher when Bron was on the bench. And the Lakers were good with AD even without LeBron.  It’s often mentioned in hypothetical posts about “what if the Lakers had kept their young core” that we could not have had D-Lo and Kuz because we traded D-Lo for the 27th pick. That’s technically true but we had the 28th pick from the Lou Williams - Corey Brewer trade and Kuz wasn’t on the Nets radar so we could have kept D-Lo and almost certainly still picked Kuz at 28. He couldn’t however trade the 28th for the picks that ended up being Hart and Thomas Bryant.  My biggest one : Magic wasn’t bad as POBO. He signed LeBron, kept a max slot for that summer and when that didn’t work he turned around and filled the roster with vets while maintaing cap flexibility for the next summer. There weren’t many shooters available so he focused on a unique “zag while everyone zigs” approach built on stacking playmakers and it was actually working. Lakers were a top-4 seed through the first 34 games, which historically has a 97% chance of leading to a playoff qualification. Our draft picks under Magic were very good. Lonzo was a no-brainer. Kuz, Hart and Thomas Bryant all picked after 27. Caruso signed to the Summer League team then upgraded to two-way. Then he threw everything he had at the AD trade but Demps seemingly just refused anything. Even the maligned Zubac - Muscala trade was about clearing Zu’s cap hold to keep maximum space for the 2019 offseason. Magic’s main fault was that he left right after we’d missed the playoffs because of a gazillion injuries and before the cap space he cleared and assets he gathered could used to upgrade into a contender. I like Rob Pelinka but his moves that offseason were largely just the logical continuation of what Magic had started."

For every international who stuck with his team, I can name two domestic players who did the same.  It turns out that great players often stay.  &gt;Exceptions:  Add Marc Gasol.  &gt;Maybe it's because U.S. players grow up in the AAU system, where they switch teams a lot as high schoolers.  Antetokounmpo bailed on his original club days after turning 18.  Ginobili jumped teams in Serie A.   Embiid transferred between US high schools because the first one wouldn't play him enough.  Not sure the cultural gap is as-wide as you claim."
Thomas Bryant esque
"I agree with Portland, Minnesota, and Sacramento, but why do you think Charlotte would be a good fit? LaMelo is a better passer than Simmons, which means Simmons would have even less of an offensive role than he has now. LaMelo shot better than expected last season, but still isn’t the kind of shooter you want to pair with Simmons. The Hornets would probably have to give up Rozier and/or Hayward for Simmons too, which means they’d be heavily lacking shooting.   Some other options I thought about:   -	Could the Hawks use Simmons? They have plenty pieces that could be useful to Philadelphia, and a Trae/Simmons pairing would be super fun. They’d probably need to trade Capela to another team for another shooter, but that should be doable.  -	What about the Wizards, if they could get him without giving up Beal? It’d probably require a three team deal, where Philly sends Wizards picks to someone like Lillard? Maybe they wait till the deadline and do a trade based around Dinwiddie, KCP, and picks? That’d leave a DC lineup of Beal, Kispert, Simmons, Rui, and Thomas Bryant. That would be a championship contender, but it could be fun."
"I honestly think blazers bsould trade CJ for Simmons and try and move Nurkic for a strech big, though the best I can think of is Thomas Bryant making similar amount or try and get Markannen on sign and Trade and play him as a strech 5 next to ben at PF.I don't think Blazers can play powell CJ and Lillard together and have Covington be the best defender to make any run in the playoffs.To me a starting five of Lillard, Powell, RoCo Ben and Bryant/Markannen has considerably higher ceiling due to the better fit and defense."
Thomas Bryant
"They've played 2 seasons both playing limited minutes, way too early to pick a best 2nd rounder from that class. Even like the 2017 class might still be too early to call. Thomas Bryant just turned 24, not crazy to think he ends up having a better career than Brooks."
"I know it's easy for me to say as someone who is just looking at the situation on paper but I agree that they should have gone all in on this rebuild, especially when it became clear that they could actually trade Westbrook for assets. I don't think know if the roster they built is much better than play-in territory (7-10) in the East and if a few teams take leaps then there's a situation where they miss the playoffs altogether.        If they could have traded Beal for a package centered around Wiggins, Wiseman, 7, and 14 they could have added to an already interesting young core. Rui, Deni, Thomas Bryant, Wiseman, Kispert, Todd, Kuminga, and Moody is a really, really great starting point for a proper rebuild plus they would have truly been able to try and get that superstar prospect in this coming draft. Not to mention Wiggins, Kuzma, Harrell, etc would have had the potential to bring back late picks too if played right. That's about as much as you can ask for when trying to pull off a quick rebuild.   I don't think Beal's return will be getting any higher than it was on draft night. I know even if they tank this year it will just be to try and get a player like Beal and obviously the Wizards know Beal better than we do. But seems like they're playing a very dangerous game where it's clear they can't get very far with him as the centerpiece and another disappointing year could push him to request a trade when the Wizards won't be able to ask for as much."
"The current Pelicans team doesn't have Randle, Clarkson, DLo, Nance, Zubac, or Thomas Bryant either. Definitely not a championship level team but could be a frisky lower seed in the playoffs.  Also unrelated but has anyone ever taken you up on your username?"
"More than just that:  &gt;Kobe’s camp told us that if he was drafted by the Kings, he wouldn’t sign. Arn Tellem — Bryant’s agent — said he wouldn’t sign with several teams in front of us either because he wanted to play for the Los Angeles Lakers. Tellem had a relationship with Jerry West, who, of course, was running the Lakers at that time.”  &gt;Tellem knew that Geoff Petrie wasn’t going to back off like other teams. Kobe didn’t care what position he was drafted, he just wanted to go to the Lakers.”  https://www.nba.com/kings/news/reynolds-remembers-night-sacramento-planned-draft-kobe-bryant  &gt;In the build-up to the draft, Bryant apparently had a change-of-heart about the Nets.  &gt;According to Abrams, shortly after meeting with Taub, Nash received a call from legendary NBA agent Arn Tellem, who was working with Bryant. Tellem told Nash that it ""isn't going to work out"" and that the Nets shouldn't draft Bryant.  &gt;Meanwhile, Calipari had gotten a call from Bryant himself in which Bryant threatened to play in Italy if the Nets drafted him.  &gt; (Isaih Thomas) had been told by Bryant's father that he didn't want Bryant playing in Canada.   https://www.businessinsider.com/how-kobe-bryant-went-lakers-not-nets-1996-nba-draft-2020-2  &gt;Eighteen years later I remember him screaming at me over the phone from Southern California that Bryant would be a Laker no matter what.  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kobe-bryant-and-the-draft-day-trade-that-changed-nba-history/"
Personally I think that got much better despite trading Russ. With Russ the Wiz were always gonna be a fun but super flawed and deep team. Flipping him for a bunch of guys who are at worst solid rotation pieces is a great deal and the Beal-Dinwiddie backcourt is a good fit because they're both fine on or off the ball. I really like Aaron Holiday and think he'll probably play above Neto and has potential to close games against smaller teams. Your center rotation will be really interesting because Thomas Bryant was playing super good for you guys at the beginning of the year before getting hurt then you got Gafford and he was immense when he got minutes and if Harrell can re-discover form from his Clips days and maybe develop pick-n-roll chemistry with Dinwiddie/Neto/Holiday he could be good too. People will say the Wiz got worse because they lost they're second best player but to me their roster makes so much more sense now and you more or less fixed one of your biggest problems which was depth.
"Yeah dude no point in even conversing with you if you’re delusional enough to say the Lakers have made “2 decades of awful personnel moves and would be the worst franchise in history if it didn’t happen to be located near Hollywood”.   I guess that hiring Phil Jackson, trading for Pau, drafting and building the 09-10 championship teams, consistently hitting on draft picks and G-League signings (Randle, Lonzo, BI, Kuz, Josh Hart, Thomas Bryant, Caruso) which allowed us to even have a chance at AD (and now Westbrook) hiring Vogel, and hiring Pelinka just to name a few key, successful moves over the “past 20 years” is classified as “consistently awful”. Not to mention, the Lakers wouldn’t have even been in that drought in the 10’s had Stern and the NBA not completely fucked them over (funny enough New Orleans would’ve been much better off with our package in hindsight).  It’s clear you just have a lot of hatred for the Lakers which is fine, just try not to make it delusional."
your the one saying lonzo is the center piece of a team with 3 all stars.    Talen Horton tucker is Kendal marshall.  Look at these select games where I put up big numbers on bench players oooh.  Oh where Have I seen this before?  Zubac only got those minutes because boogie cant play minutes and Ibaka was out.  Thomas Bryant is on the fucking wizards averaging 11 points a game. What the hell is your level of greatness? sheesh lol
Jordan Clarkson is an integral piece to the Jazz and just won 6MOTY. Lonzo is now a centerpiece on the Bulls and is amazing on defense+improved his 3 point shooting to the point he’s considered a good shooter. Zubac had great games in the playoffs and waa getting a good chunk of minutes in the playoffs. Thomas Bryant is also good what the hell? Every player I listed is a good/decent role player. Watch some basketball bro and I guarantee you’ll learn more.   THT is also only 20 years old. Younger than a lot of the guys who got drafted and has a 7’1 wingspan on a 6’4 body. There’s a reason why he got the pay that he got this off-season. He’s shown flashes of greatness and is incredible for someone his age. I don’t even know if you’re trolling but I feel like I took the bait 😭
"Jordan Clarkson, Julius randle, Larry Nance Jr, Lonzo, Brandon Ingram, d’Angelo, Josh Hart, Zubac, and Thomas Bryant have all turned out decent to amazing. You’re just talking out of your ass 😂"
"hmm  Could do Bertans, Thomas Bryant, Avdija and picks for Tobias? (Does work financially)  Bertans would be shooting, which is always good, but he’s kinda awful at everything other than shooting. Like a bigger, worse, Seth Curry. Dunno if they want Bryant with Joel + Drummond. Tho he could play the 4? Sixers probably wouldn’t want Avdija. Isn’t too good rn, and Sixers don’t want to wait to get their value.   Wizards would love it   PG: Dinwiddie - Neto - Holiday SG: Beal - KCP SF: Tobias - Kispert PF: Rui - Kuzma C: Gafford - Trezz"
"&gt; There’s a serious chance that you could make a roster out of all of the best players in NBA history excluding the ones on the Dream Team, and the Dream Team would still be better.  Hmmm, just basically pulling the first 12 NBA badasses out of the air that I can think of and sticking with USA players only:  Jerry West   Steph Curry    LeBron James    Tim Duncan   Kareem Abdul-Jabbar    Isiah Thomas   Oscar Robertson   Kobe Bryant    Rick Barry   Kevin Durant   Moses Malone   Shaquille O'Neal    I think I'd pick this team over Dream Team in a 7-game series ... but I'm not sure; it'd be close."

I think this team is much more competitive in the regular season assuming they figure out how to use Berta's and convince everyone that rebounding and defense do matter.  Not a lot of promise for post season success though."

"Dinwiddie, Beal, Kuzma, Montrezl, Thomas Bryant"
"Hahaha. Personally I really liked Svi and he was one of the casualties during the Magic Johnson front office era. Svi, Zubac, and Thomas Bryant just gone for nothing 😭"
"I was never a fan of this stat. The common thread on all those teams: if it's not Westbrook + KD/PG/Beal scoring, who else is gonna get it done?   The third option on those teams in respective order: Ibaka, Schroder, Thomas Bryant / Rui Hachimura (when Bryant got injured)."
"Everyone saying ‘what a return for Washington’. Here’s the problem (which we just saw in LA)  Both Kuzma sad Harrell are exclusive 4s. Play them at any other position and your team is at a deficit. Who do the wizards have? Another exclusive 4, Rui Hachimira. They’re gonna have the same problem LA had. Harrell can get you 15 a game in his sleep, but you need to play him next to  a guy like Thomas Bryant. So he and Kuz and Rui all work the same. And Rui obviously takes precedent, so once again Kuz has no set role"
the whole team got covid......they lost thomas bryant. wizards 3rd best player was RoLo
"By taking Thomas Bryant for free. I mean, it worked out well for us too"
"I always confuse Tony Bradley with Thomas Bryant, so at first I was excited that the Bulls got a guy like Nikola who could stretch the floor from center. Then I looked up Tony Bradley and realized he's not Thomas Bryant, but Bradley's advanced metrics are still pretty solid (20+ PER in limited minutes, for instance). So, I'm in.  Anyway, it's nice to have a solid offseason after two decades of going through things like:  * This is Phil's last year no matter what/Breaking up the best team in league history to satisfy Krause's ego. * Thinking Marcus Fizer was a small forward/an NBA player * ~~Asking Tracy McGrady if he'll shave his cornrows~~ \[Edit: Turns out I may be conflating two different stories on this one.\] * Drafting LaMarcus and trading him for Tyrus Thomas * Signing late era Ben Wallace and trading early era Ben Wallace (I.E., Tyson Chandler) * Picking the wrong Italian head coach (Del Negro instead of D'Antoni) * Striking out on LeBron, Wade, Bosh to get Boozer (who was admittedly solid and goofy) * Making Luol Deng get a spinal tap * Trading Korver for nothing * Running Thibodeau out of town * Trading Nurkic and Gary Harris for Doug McDermott, then trading Doug McDermott, Taj Gibson, and a second round pick for Cameron Payne then waiving Cameron Payne * Hiring Hoiberg to run a modern perimeter-based offense then signing Wade and Rondo * Giving up on Bobby Portis because he struck a Spaniard * \[Some additional edits\]: * [~~Jim Boylan~~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Boylan) The wrong [Jim Boylen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Boylen). * Waiving Dinwiddie (thanks to u/darealcubs for the reminder) * Just the bewildering love affair with all things Iowa State. * Trading for John Starks * Completely forgot about the short-lived John Salmons era that ended with the Bulls trading Salmons and draft picks that turned out to be Isaiah Thomas and Larry Sanders for Joe Alexander and Hakim Warrick * Not locking up Rusty LaRue on a long term deal.  Not sure I got this all in chronological order, and obviously there were some really fun Bulls teams in there (the scrappy Ben Gordon-led teams and the Derrick Rose + Bench Mob teams of the early 10s), but I am very happy with what the Bulls have done this past couple of days. This is 100% me being a homer, but I think the only teams in the East that are clearly better are Milwaukee and Brooklyn. (""Clearly"" being the key word there.)  Anyway, I'm wearing the shit out of my Bulls hat today and now I need to stop procrastinating and get back to work."
"Every single member of the Lakers core has gotten contracts above $10M/yr, with the exception of Caruso, who is just shy at $9.25M/yr.  We didn't dump Kuzma or Caruso to get a star. Kuzma was traded after we gave him a fat contract and winning a championship, and Caruso got paid by another team in free agency after winning a championship. Ingram got the max from the Pelicans, and Ball just signed a $85M contract in free agency.  Clarkson was traded after we gave him a fat contract, Nance got a fat contract by the Cavs after we traded him, Zubac got a fat contract by the Clips after we traded him. Even Thomas Bryant got paid after we traded him.  Meanwhile, the Celtics played IT into the ground, and he never got his brinks truck, before or after he was thrown away by the Celtics."
Thomas Bryant
"Yall had probably one of the better drafting sprees we have seen. In that 5ish years yall drafted what? 3 guys that became (admittedly 1time) allstars, 7 really solid rotational players, Ball, Clarkson, Nance, Thomas Bryant, Kuzma, Zubac, Hart, AC (technically not drafted iirc, which is even more impressive).. if the 2 worst singing in franchise history dont happen yall would have looked like Gods."
"2/3 are injury prone, then you have Rui. I think this Team will depend on how good/available Deni and Thomas Bryant are"
Gafford/Thomas Bryant (when healthy)
Thomas Bryant or Gafford
Yea... the writing was on the wall.   Dinwiddie wanted the role and the bag.   Hopefully we can get Thomas Bryant out of it instead of Harrell. Or maybe move on from DJ.
"Wizards are working out a sign and trade for Dinwiddie. Just trying to get the pieces right with another team involved.  How about this? Let me know if anything needs to change and what you think?  Brooklyn Receive: Bertans &amp; Thad Young   OKC receive: DeAndre Jordan, 1 x WAS 2nd Rnd Pick  Wiz receives: Dinwiddie and Svi Mykhailuik  Chicago receives: Thomas Bryant, 2 x BKN 2nd Rnd Picks  Brooklyn gets two guys who help them make a push for a championship.  OKC gets Jordan who they could waive and get more cap flexibility plus the 2nd Round has a clause to get the better positioning of Was, Chicago, Lakers 2nd Rounders.  Wiz get their point guard in Dinwiddie and Svi to play hard off the bench.  Chicago gets a young big man who can help off the bench behind Vuce plus multiple second rounders that they can package for a trade later on.  Salaries work out and every team gets a benefit out of it."
"A) Kuzma is available, maybe for cheap even since the Wizards have three ~6'9 guys who play PF AND Thomas Bryant  B) at this point Kuzma has been shit on by Laker and LeBron stans so hard he's actually underrated.  His contract is ideal for making cap space to sign whales like Westbrook, but he's not overpaid."
"Actually, Thomas Bryant hasn't been too terrible for us. If anything he was  regarded as one of the better centers that could spread the floor before his injury"
Thomas Bryant too a lil bit ago
"I mean we're kinda limited. I hope the Nets re-sign Bruce Brown, keep one of Jeff Green or Blake, go after Forbes or JJ Redick (only for the minimum), and I guess sign and trade Dinwiddie to Washington since it seems like he wants to go there (for Kuz and Thomas Bryant not Trez).   Other than that we can really only go after ring chasers that will take the minimum. Hopefully we can add some decent defenders."
"Wizards can sign and trade for Dinwiddie and would still have Harrell or Kuzma to add to the front court, along with Thomas Bryant coming back from injury and ostensibly a competent new coach.  As long as everyone stays healthy they'll be in the playoff hunt."
"Lakers shouldn’t be over looked. Ingram, Dlo, lonzo, hart, Kuzma, Thomas Bryant, THT, N Alexander- walker etc"
"Every single draft has some big guy who is pretty decent that goes late. Claxton was pick 31. Mitchell Robinson was 36. Timelord, 27 in the same draft. Thomas Bryant went 42. Jarrett Allen went 22 the same draft. Zubac, 32nd.  2015 had Nance 27, Portis 22, Hernangomez 35, Richaun Holmes 37, Montrezl Harrell 32. The year before was Jokic at 41, Dwight Powell at 45, and Capela at 25. The year before that? Dieng was 21, Plumlee 22, Gobert 27. Before that? Draymond at 35.   Every year, there's perfectly serviceable 5s available between pick 20 and pick 45. Every year."
"Lakers. Ball, Ingram, Josh Hart, Clarkson, Randle, Thomas Bryant, Kobe Bryant."
No but Thomas Bryant is a UFA next year and if the Wizards feel like Gafford is their guy going forward it gives both teams what they need.
Nets are pushing for Kuzma + Thomas Bryant in return instead
"Look at the Lakers non-lottery picks here. THT, Kuz, Hart, Nance, etc. Only 2 out and out bad picks.  46	LAL	Talen Horton-Tucker 25	LAL	Moritz Wagner 39	LAL	Isaac Bonga 47	LAL	Svi Mykhailiuk 27	LAL	Kyle Kuzma 30	LAL	Josh Hart 42	LAL	Thomas Bryant 32	LAL	Ivica Zubac 27	LAL	Larry Nance Jr. 34	LAL	Anthony Brown 46	LAL	Jordan Clarkson"

"Add in Thomas Bryant, Josh Hart and Zubac"
"It's wild how almost all of them are killing it rn. Randle just won mip. Russell and BI became all stars. Clarkson won 6moty. And Lonzo, Hart, and Thomas Bryant are thriving.  I wonder how good this team would be if they all stuck around. Probably still not a championship contender without Bron or AD but goddamn they would be fun to watch."
They also got Josh Hart and Thomas Bryant in that draft. Both AFTER Kuz. That's pretty wild.

"Shortly after the Washington Wizards’ season ended with a first-round playoff loss, general manager Tommy Sheppard dropped a hint of what was to come.  “This is not a run-it-back team,” he said.  Now, it’s official. Changes are arriving. Big ones.  Just before Thursday’s NBA Draft, the Wizards and Lakers agreed to a deal that will send Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles for Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell and the No. 22 pick, sources told The Athletic. Washington also will route a 2024 and a 2028 second-round pick to L.A. The swap won’t become official until the start of free agency on Aug. 6.  As Bradley Beal spent the last few weeks mulling his future with the organization, as The Athletic previously reported, Westbrook also was deciding his own. The former MVP, who is from the L.A. area, spent parts of the offseason discussing the possibility of teaming up with four-time champion LeBron James and eight-time All-Star Anthony Davis. Westbrook had a growing desire to join James and Davis in Los Angeles to compete for a championship, sources said. He formally informed the Wizards of his desires recently, according to sources: if they could find a trade that works, Westbrook wanted to go to the Lakers.  They landed on one.  Washington executed the deal with no issues from Beal, per sources. The three-time All-Star, who is entering the final season of his contract, has expressed no desire to leave the Wizards, according to sources. As speculation about his future has swirled, the team remains confident it can keep him for the long term. The Wizards can offer him a four-year, $180 million extension in October, but if he waits until 2022 free agency, he can sign a five-year contract for an estimated $235 million to return to Washington.  One of the main reasons Westbrook wanted to come to D.C. when the Wizards traded John Wall for him in December was the presence of head coach Scott Brooks, who coached the former MVP from 2008-15 in Oklahoma City. But the Wizards did not retain Brooks when his contract expired at the end of the 2020-21 season despite Westbrook’s outspoken recommendation that they should.  Westbrook preferred a more established coach to replace Brooks, according to sources. The Wizards eventually hired former Nuggets assistant Wes Unseld Jr., whose résumé includes 16 years as an NBA assistant and eight more as an advance scout.  The Lakers set an offseason goal to acquire an elite playmaker next to James and Davis. They deemed Westbrook worthy. He averaged a triple-double during his one season in D.C., the fourth time in five years he’s done so. Many in the Wizards organization praised him for how he changed the team’s culture and work ethic. He will turn 33 years old at the start of next season and has two years and $91 million remaining on his contract.  The Wizards believe the package from the Lakers improves their depth. They view Caldwell-Pope, one of Beal’s closest friends in the league and the type of player they have sought after for years, as their next starting small forward. Washington went into the offseason hoping to improve its defense and long-range shooting. Caldwell-Pope can guard the perimeter physically and is versatile. He sank 41 percent of his 3-point attempts last year.  He will reposition 2020 first-round pick Deni Avdija to the bench, the Wizards’ preferred spot for the 20-year-old as he returns from a fractured fibula.  The trade gives Washington more roster flexibility, too. Westbrook has a couple of seasons remaining on a supermax contract. Breaking his deal into three middling ones could make it easier for the Wizards to pull off trades for more reasonable salaries.  Harrell is only one year removed from winning NBA Sixth Man of the Year and averaged 13.5 points per game for the Lakers last season, but he fell out of their rotation during the playoffs. Kuzma has improved as a defender and shot 36 percent from beyond the 3-point arc in 2020-21. Both create redundancies on what’s now an imbalanced roster.  Renovations are coming — especially at point guard, where the team has an obvious, Westbrook-sized hole.  Sources say to keep an eye on 28-year-old free agent Spencer Dinwiddie, who missed most of last season with a torn ACL but averaged 20.6 points per game in 2019-20. The Wizards are above the salary cap but could try to negotiate a sign-and-trade with Dinwiddie’s incumbent team, the Nets. The other pieces from the Westbrook trade, Harrell and Kuzma alone, would not be enough for Brooklyn to accept a Dinwiddie deal, according to a source. Dinwiddie is expected to receive interest from several teams, including the Nets, Knicks, Heat and Raptors, sources said.  The Wizards made a smaller move for a point guard Thursday, flipping the No. 22 pick, which they received in the Westbrook trade, to the Pacers for fourth-year guard Aaron Holiday and No. 31, which netted them 19-year-old stretch 4 Isaiah Todd. Washington grew enamored with Holiday when he worked out for them before the 2018 draft and actually tried to trade for him a year ago.  That wasn’t all. The Wizards’ Thursday night also included selecting 22-year-old sharpshooter Corey Kispert with the No. 15 pick, which gives them another 3-point threat. Kispert, who made 44 percent of his long-range attempts last season at Gonzaga, was the top shooter on the Wizards’ list and No. 10 on their draft big board, a source said. Sheppard mentioned in a news conference that the Wizards explored trading up for him before taking him 15th.  Washington is now capable of loading lineups with shooters, something it seriously struggled with in 2020-21 when it neither made nor took many 3-pointers. It finished 23rd in 3-point percentage and 29th in 3-point rate (the percentage of their field-goal attempts that came from beyond the arc). Now, it can piece together units with Beal, Kispert, Davis Bertans, Thomas Bryant and whomever it has at point guard. Caldwell-Pope will fit in there, too. The Wizards now have 3-point menaces.  If Dinwiddie does not end up in D.C., options remain. This summer’s free agency class is rich with capable point guards — from top-flight ones (who are not realistic for Washington), like Chris Paul, Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry to more reasonably-priced ones, like Reggie Jackson, Patty Mills, Cameron Payne and Devonte’ Graham, amongst others. A reunion with free-agent Raul Neto, who spot-started for the Wizards last season, is a possibility, sources say.  They can use the mid-level exception, worth up to $9.5 million, to sign free agents. The Westbrook and Holiday trades, which shave more than $5 million from their payroll, give them extra room to operate below the luxury tax line. They also created an $8.5 million trade exception in the Westbrook deal, which they can use to trade for a player who makes up to $8.6 million (yes, it’s confusing, but that’s not a typo) without having to match salaries in the exchange.  For now, the roster is unbalanced. But moves are coming. Teams can begin speaking to free agents on Aug. 2.  The Wizards have 15 players under contract. But with Westbrook gone and both Neto and Ish Smith hitting free agency, they have only one point guard in Holiday, a 24-year-old who was a backup in Indiana last season and projects to hold a similar role in 2021-22.  They have a logjam of 3/4 types. Rui Hachimura, Avdija, Bertans, Kuzma and Chandler Hutchison all overlap in some way or another. Kispert could fit into this player type, too. They’re adding the second-rounder Todd to the mix too. Power forward Anthony Gill and wing Caleb Homesley are under contract but are non-guaranteed for 2021-22.  They have another crowd at center with three players who warrant playing time: Bryant, Harrell and Daniel Gafford — though Bryant will miss the beginning of the season as he continues to recover from the ACL he ruptured in January. The Wizards hope he can return by December, according to a source, though it’s difficult to lock in a specific return time this far out.  But this is not what the roster will look like at the start of the season. The Wizards, after all, were not a run-it-back team. And now, they are officially not running it back."
"To be fair the Lakers team has scouted well in the 2nd round. Svi, Thomas Bryant, Bonga, Zubac, Talen Horton Tucker."
"Beal, Rui, Kuzma, Bertans, Thomas Bryant/Robin Lopez, Aidja + flotsam. Is this a borderline playoff team?"
"Lonzo Ball, D'Angelo Russell, Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, Ivica Zubac.   Jordan Clarkson, Svi Mykhailiuk Josh Hart, Larry Nance Jr, Thomas Bryant."
And giving us Thomas Bryant for pennies
"Westbrook and beal plus Thomas Bryant, Mo Wagner, and Isaac Bonga"
"Dinwiddie, Beal, KUZ CONTROL, Hachimura, Bertans  Deni, KCP, Thomas Bryant  Ummmm Yea. He got a SQUAD now  This trade was a WIN WIN that why it's happening  Lakers with AD/LeBron/Russ = Title Faves  Wizards are so DEEP and can run through the East"
"They plan to build around their new team. Presenting the ~~Lakers~~ I mean, the Wizards. Built around former Laker players.   PG: 22nd pick   SG: Caldwell Pope   SF: Isaac Bonga  PF: Kyle Kuzma  C: Thomas Bryant      6th Man: Montrezl Harrell"
"The question is... how far into the bench would USA have to go to lose to the world's best?  Team 1 = Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Tim Duncan, Kareem Abdul Jabaar  Team 2 = Steph Curry, Kobe Bryant, Larry Bird, Kevin Durant, Shaquille O'Neal  Team 3 = Oscar Robertson, Jerry West, Julius Erving, Charles Barkley, Wilt Chamberlain  Team 4 = Chris Paul, Dwayne Wade, Elgin Baylor, Karl Malone, Bill Russell  Team 5 = John Stockton, John Havlicek, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Garnett, Moses Malone  Team 6 = Isaiah Thomas, James Harden, Scottie Pippen, Anthony Davis, David Robinson  Team 7 = Bob Cousy, Allen Iverson, Bob Pettit, Elvin Hayes, George Mikan  Team 8 = Russell Westbrook, Rick Barry, George Gervin, Dominique Wilkins, Bill Walton"
"The Wizards aren't in the same situation as most of the perennial .500 eastern conference teams I don't think.  They've got some intriguing upside with literally any coach who isn't Scott Brooks.  Even though the box score numbers don't look much different, Rui showed nice growth as a shooter this season and he's going to be an above average starter in a year or two, Deni looks like a great jack of all trades glue guy in the vein of Kirilenko (assuming their new coach isn't a massive tool and uses him logically), Thomas Bryant is a nice floor spacing 4/5 and should fit nicely in a rotation with Gafford as their defensive C, and of course they still have Beal.  We'll see what happens with Westbrook and Bertans, but I think they could very well be in contention for the 4th seed in the East next season (they might have been last season had they not gotten destroyed by Covid and injuries for the first half of the season)."
If Russ is still there then RIP spacing  Be a fun watch though. They'd still be good enough to be a top 6 seed if healthy especially if Thomas Bryant comes back strong
"Lets put it this way if they play the sixers again fully healthy (and embiid doesnt miss those games) the sixers sweep the wizards. Thomas Bryant is a terrible defender, and russ and beal playing healthy wouldnt make a difference besides one maybe just maybe 2 games thats being generous. Sure playing alex len hurts but none of there centers can check him and they have no defensive philosophy either.   Against the hawks they are not nearly capable of checking them in a 7 game series, trae pick and rolls will destroy them so thats 4 teams right there. They are not being a defensive team like the knicks who will only get better and not to mention the heat and celtics werent fully healthy (no brown for celtics) theyre both better teams especially the celtics when healthy who they played in the playin and let tatum score 50. There team isnt good at all they have 2 stars, 2 good role players but the rest arent cut out to be on a playoff team."
"Assuming everyone is healthy, against the Bucks/ Nets, Wiz go home 1st round. Against everyone else, (depending on what Sixers do), they can compete. Lots of games were lost with too much Alex Len, too much Russ-Ish-Neto lineups, Thomas Bryant injury, Russ and Beal playing hurt, COVID."
"He's done well for a 27th pick. They also picked Nance 27th, Josh Hart 30th, Zubac 32nd, Clarkson 42nd, and Thomas Bryant 46th."
"Russel was also injured for the first half of the year, not to mention thomas bryant being out, and davis bertrans being one of their only good shooters"
Adding 9 wins to a lottery team that was largely the same minus Thomas Bryant sure seems like a good achievement for a top 15-20 guy according to his fans.  It's pretty easy for a bad team to improve to below average compared to improving as an average team or a good team.  If that's the standard you are judging westbrook by then good for you. I expect more from so called top 20 guys.
Thomas Bryant is like a 15 mpg playoff center at best  he can score but he can’t defend to save his life
"Well they have a new head coach, plus Westbrook and Thomas Bryant will be healthy for the season (knocks on wood)"
That means Thomas Bryant is probably gone too
"There’s chatter because he and sabonis have supposed fit issues, in a small market, and they are quality players. The chatter is because teams could use him, otherwise he would be like dieng or Thomas Bryant, end of bench bigs."
"Could see him in Toronto, maybe Washington if Robin Lopez doesn't come back and Thomas Bryant isn't ready for start of the season. Dallas and Charlotte could use him as well."
"Wonder how much he'll go for. If Wizards trade Thomas Bryant, and start Gafford, he would be a formidable back up for sure."

i like this game  Mike James Thomas Bryant Shawn Bradley Beal
"It’s almost fair except you gotta take it into account both teams desperateness. Sure LA has the title window desperateness, but that Russ contract is a negative asset. Any other team, outside of maybe the clippers, and Wizards are ADDING a first to get rid of him.   So either 2 things would need to happen to make this trade fair:  Add another win-now piece for LA. Thomas Bryant is probably too valuable to Washington, so I’d say Davis Bertran (but Bryant would be perfect  for LA)  Or it’d be Schroeder and either Kuzma or THT, not both of them"
"Thomas Bryant bro, future goat"
Isiah Thomas? Ron Artest? Kobe Bryant?
"Without Bradley Beal I honestly don’t think we would’ve gotten 15 wins during the 2019-2020 seasons. He got the team to the 9th seed with his 2nd best player being Thomas Bryant, and third best being Bertans. Imo that’s extremity impressive. He was also doubled almost every possession while putting up 30 ppg, and was not named an all star. Honestly I’d say he’s underrated but I’m also extremely biased."
Wonder how Thomas Bryant is doing
"Two great things that would go terribly together. Guys who operate in the same space and/or need the opposite of what the other brings. Guys with similar personalities but different game philosophies.   Allen Iverson &amp; Patrick Ewing. Sorry OP. Cheating a bit. The greatest off the dribble PNR guy with a stationary low post operator.   Kobe Bryant &amp; Isiah Thomas. Ball dominant orchestraters who’d get into fistfights about who The Man is.   Larry Bird &amp; James Harden. A movement creator and the ball pounder. Cultural differences?   Grant Hill &amp; LeBron. Too similar, too interested in playing chess, these two complement each other too well and don’t make up for each other’s minor deficiencies. There can only be one smartest guy on the court and it’d be like having two teachers pet’s vying for valedictorian."
"This whole thread is sleeping on the Wiz. Beal's out with something to prove, Hachimura and Avdija will level up, Gafford will be a beast on defense if he worked on his stamina in the offseason. Thomas Bryant will eventually come back from injury. And if Bertans returns to his form from a couple years ago... and that's not even to get started on all the new guys.  It's not a star-studded lineup, but they've finally got depth and upside. Beal hasn't even peaked yet."

"Michael Carter Williams, Bryant Reeves, Roy Hibbert, Jeremy Lin, Jahlil Okafor, Isaiah Thomas *to an extent* because the argument that his hip injury ruined his career is very valid but even then he hasn’t done much to prove himself  Brent Barry even though I wouldn’t necessarily say he was ever a *great* player, but that 01-02 campaign was pretty decent  John Salmons was pretty good for a bit  That’s about all I can think of"
"Brandon Ingram got a max, D'Angelo Russell got a max, randle got a bag, Nance is a great player, Josh Hart is a great bench player, Kuz just got us Russell Westbrook lol  We drafted great players, even our second rounders like Jordan Clarkson hit , Thomas Bryant is starting for the wiz, this idea of disappointing players is garbage   &gt;I highly doubt magic was the dominant factor there, but ya never know I guess.   Literally gave an article with lebron saying why he went to la, and it had nothing to do with the movies or the night life, he could have stayed in Miami if he just wanted the nightlife   &gt;And no, nowhere was I talking about Pelinka specifically there.  That's why it's a garbage statement, lebron and AD were not products of the previous FO, so it's just you saying general statements that have no context   The Lakers were bad for a period of time , what does that have to do with the reason lebron is here now? We had the assets and the cap space and lebron saw that as well"
Your defense is going to blow if you have Porzingis and Thomas Bryant as your centers

"But that’s on the sixers. They’ve a functional coach and system. We’re talking about the wizards. A very dysfunctional team with no system and barely a gm. If they still have Beal, then yes. Maybe they could do 50 games. If they don’t have Beal then rui is gonna score? Do they still have Bertans? Do you trust him to score? Is Thomas Bryant gonna function with the non-shooting Simmons?"
"for sure! Wizards and Lakers make a lot of deals together. We got Thomas Bryant, Bonga, and Mo Swagner from them too."
"Yup. Definitely. The Lakers love guys like THT throughout the years.   ""Young with potential"" who were late picks.  We've had a few who didn't turn out well like Darius Morris, Devin Ebanks, Andrew Goudlock, Anthony Brown etc.   But we've had some success too with Jordan Clarkson, Thomas Bryant, Ivica Zubac, Alex Caruso, David Nwaba.   THT has been good enough. It's just that Lakers fans are just more vocal and lakers players get more spotlight.   JC and AC were better prospects IMO but they don't have THT's physical gifts which the Lakers are banking on."
"&gt;For most of his childhood, Embiid applied his talent to volleyball. As late as 2011, when he was 15 years old, he was still serious about volleyball and considered training for Cameroon’s national team in Europe, reports ESPN.  &gt;Embiid’s family, particularly his father, strongly encouraged him to stick with volleyball. Thomas even told him that nobody in Cameroon played basketball. Volleyball was a popular sport with a competitive standing in the country. At that point, Embiid had only played basketball for three months. [Source](https://www.sportscasting.com/joel-embiids-life-wouldve-been-much-different-if-it-werent-for-kobe-bryant/)  It was Embiid's primary sport for a long time."
"Three all stars (you forgot DLo) and one 6MOTY (you forgot Clarkson) along with a bunch of decent/good role players (Nance, Kuz, Svi, Thomas Bryant, Nwaba).   You can literally blame anything on the Lakers that isn't drafting lmao."
"**Trade 1:** Warriors get big 3 with Beal  **Details:** Beal and Thomas Bryant to Warriors for Wiggins, one of Kuminga or Moody, Wiseman, and 2/3 FRPs  **Explanation:** Warriors need some more spark given how limited Draymond is offensively now. Beal hopefully finally wants out. Wizards get a young piece in Kuminga/Moody and Wiseman along with 2/3 FRPs and a great starter in Wiggins.   &amp;#x200B;  **Trade 2:** Dame finally asks out  **Details:** Dame and A. Simmons to Celtics for JB, Rob Williams, Josh Richardson, Aaron Nesmith and 2/3 FRPs  **Explanation:** Dame and JT make the Celtics an actual threat for the next 2-3 years while Dame is still good. No way Portland says yes without getting at least JB in return, good starter in Rob Williams, and a good young piece in Nesmith. J. Rich mostly in there for salary matching. And of course, picks.  &amp;#x200B;  **Trade 3:** Luka hopefully gets a more reliable scoring option next to him and some defense  **Details:** KP for Evan Fournier, Nerlens Noel, and Kevin Knox   **Explanation:** KP has been trash for the Mavs and needs a change in scenery. Luka gets a 18 ppg consistent shooter in Fournier, a great defensive big and lob threat in Noel, and Kevin Knox as a ball boy at practice."
I saw him hit one over Thomas Bryant in this video too.
"“Picks outside of the top 10 have been questionable”  Cmon bro. Clarkson, Nance, Hart, Kuz, and Thomas Bryant have all been solid in the league. All late picks by the Lakers FO. Not to mention finding Caruso out of the G-league. THT has shown flashes too and he’s a late 2nd round pick. Please explain to me how that is “questionable”???  Also hard to judge development of their young stars when they were all traded away before being able to show out.   The Lakers were set up to compete during the 10s with CP3 and Kobe in their backcourt till the league stunningly axed the trade. Would you rather have the Lakers be a .500 team that whole time with no real shot to win the chip or suck ass and get high draft picks— draft picks that lead to AD?? I’m glad they sucked.   Your criticism of the Lakers makes no sense."

"Zubac might get the start over Nance. Bonga could maybe play some spot minutes while jc, kuz, caruso, and hart come off the bench with nance. Mo wagner and thomas bryant would be on the bench clapping.  Honorable mention: our Oldest member of the young core - math tutor Andre Ingram"
With a bench of   Caruso Clarkson Hart Kuzma Zubac Thomas Bryant
"&gt;I will also add that my buddy and I saw Kareem on Kauai in 1987 and his big ass was wearing a silver speedo on the beach. It was weird.  Haha, man that's a great story man. So Kareem is pretty locked in at the center position. And since his feet were slow, the four would be awful.  Shaq normally slid into the paint from the perimeter, moved amazing for his size, and was just really great at slithering in.   Shaq can be better off playing the 5 for his team but for THIS team, stretching the floor wouldn't be a bad idea. He can be an inside-out big like Thomas Bryant on my Wizards.  Now the biggest question is if Shaq should be benched to accommodate an Anthony Davis, a James Worthy, and if so, would it be enough spacing for Magic to start instead of LeBron or not?"
What will happens when thomas bryant comes back?will any of your centers get moved?
When is Thomas Bryant supposed to come back?
"They also let Thomas Bryant go that same summer, along with Julius Randle."
Drafted Klay and Thomas Bryant LMAO
And Thomas Bryant
"Anyone who said that doesn't know anything about our team. We made the playoffs last year, had a winning record with Beal in the lineup, and our roster is *notably* better this year. We added Dinwiddie, KCP, Trez, and Kuzma, and we are also going to see a lot more of Gafford and Thomas Bryant this year."

"Yeah I’d say they have better guards but it’s close, worse wings, and about equal bigs. They still have a lot of big unknowns with a bunch of new players that we will have to see how they fit (lakers guys, Aaron holiday, and Dinwiddie). They also have two draft picks with potential (kispert, and todd) and then if their young players like rui, deni, gafford, and thomas bryant can make improvements they are looking real good. Also if bertans starts hitting threes this team has lots of potential."
List:   - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar - Ray Allen - Giannis Antetokounmpo - Carmelo Anthony - Nate Archibald - Paul Arizin - Charles Barkley - Rick Barry - Elgin Baylor - Dave Bing - Larry Bird - Kobe Bryant - Wilt Chamberlain - Bob Cousy - Dave Cowens - Billy Cunningham - Stephen Curry - Anthony Davis - Dave DeBusschere - Clyde Drexler - Damian Lillard - Tim Duncan - Jerry Lucas - Kevin Durant - Karl Malone - Julius Erving - Moses Malone - Patrick Ewing - Pete Maravich - Walt Frazier - Bob McAdoo - Kevin Garnett - Kevin McHale - George Gervin - George Mikan - Hal Greer - Reggie Miller - James Harden - Earl Monroe - John Havlicek - Steve Nash - Elvin Hayes - Dirk Nowitzki - Allen Iverson - Hakeem Olajuwon - LeBron James - Shaquille O'Neal - Magic Johnson - Robert Parish - Sam Jones - Chris Paul - Michael Jordan - Gary Payton - Jason Kidd - Bob Pettit - Kawhi Leonard - Paul Pierce - Scottie Pippen - Willis Reed - Oscar Robertson - David Robinson - Dennis Rodman - Bill Russell - Dolph Schayes - Bill Sharman - John Stockton - Isiah Thomas - Nate Thurmond - Wes Unseld - Dwyane Wade - Bill Walton - Jerry West - Russell Westbrook - Lenny Wilkens - Dominique Wilkins - James Worthy
"What up Spencer, how you think the depth on the squad will play out? Obviously it’s great for injuries and a long season, but Kispert got a DNP last night, Thomas Bryant and Rui still need to be integrated.  Seems like we got 12/13+ rotation players for 10 slots."
And Clarkson and Thomas Bryant
"Below are some of the players who are gone now, but were on the Laker’s roster the year before LeBron joined them, and during his first season with the team -    Lonzo Ball    De’Andre Hunter  **Was drafted by Lakers but shipped off in the AD trade.    Ivica Zubac    Thomas Bryant    Brandon Ingram    Kyle Kuzma    Josh Hart    Alex Caruso    KCP    Larry Nance    Julius Randle    Reggie Bullock    Jordan Clarkson    Brook Lopez    LeBron James   I wouldn't mind seeing this team in action."
Oh without a doubt the Bucks inside game isn't even that great which is why the Nets performance is concerning.  They won't be able to handle guys like Thomas Bryant or Mitchell Robinson this year at all.  They will be feasting
Thomas Bryant
i think him and thomas bryant (hope he returns to form) can be a very interesting mix up and duo at center for us. glad tb doesn't have to be the only center anymore.
My point is the dude couldn’t get 12 minutes a game unless an injury. This is an obscene amount of money unless you are projecting him to start over Thomas Bryant.
"In the past 2 years, Wizards had 7 former Laker Players:  Isaac Bonga  Moritz Wagner  Thomas Bryant  Kyle Kuzma   Montrezl Harrell   Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  Joel Ayayi  If you jump back one more year, you can add Isaiah Thomas to the list too."
"Both guys have hardly played.   And look at previous years...   Terrance Mann, Horton-Tucker, Eric Paschell, Bruce Brown, Diallo, Svi Mykhailluk, Shake Milton, Monte Morris, Dillon Brooks, Thomas Bryant...   These guys are actually playing minutes and were drafted in the 40s/50s. Its not that unusual."
"Larry Nance   Thomas Bryant   We drafted late firsts and second round players that usually get played out of the league in three years and they're still rotational players, that's a win"
"Gafford is more of a PF playing up size. Their franchise cornerstone centre, Thomas Bryant, tore his ACL at the start of last season.  They were playing Alex Len and Robin Lopez as their centres... I mean I had no doubt Russ was gonna take them to the playoffs. But... holy sht I had my doubts for a while xD"
Trez has had a decent game too. They've got a good center depth when Thomas Bryant Jr comes back
"What is a realistic trade you team would do for him? I hope wiz offer a lottery protected first, kuzma, a second rounder, and maybe like Thomas Bryant lol. Anything else would feel like an overpay to me"

"Maybe 12 of us.  But since you asked, here goes  While Russ did do a drag job last season, him and Beal alone with basically no depth can’t get us past the first round.  Especially not from the play-in.  So we got out of Russ contract and got KCP, Kuz, and Trez back.  Plus with other moves In this same deal, we turned the 22nd pick and a 2024 second round pick into Aaron Holiday and Dinwiddie.  Which is a solid haul for one getting out of that contract which made no sense for our team right now, and getting some young talent or trade filler later depending how this coming season goes.   So if we boil that down, we got out of the Wall contract from 2 years ago, and turned it into what I list.  We fired Scott Brooks and hired Wes Unseld Jr.  Who is a great young first time coach ready to get to work.  Had a pretty decent draft and We are getting Thomas Bryant and Deni Avdija back from injury plus re-signed Raul Neto.  We still have Beals decision hanging out there but something will happen with that soon.   So yea I’d say the Wizards got better this off season."
"I think they should trade Turner for Davis Bertans and a pick or Thomas Bryant or something like that.  The Wizards have depth but desperately need rim protection, and Bertans would be a really great addition for obvious reasons. I think that trade makes both teams significantly better."
"If they chose the best possible player with the best fit at every pick every year? Probably a lineup of  Ben Simmons  Devin Booker  Jayson Tatum  Tobias Harris  Joel Embiid  With guys like Mikal Bridges, Dejountae Murray, Malcolm Brogdon, Thomas Bryant, Robert Williams off the bench."
"Starters: PG: Kemba Walker SG: Donovan Mitchell SF: Tobias Harris PF: Jonathan Isaac C: Thomas Bryant  2nd Unit: PG: James Bouknight (Ik he’s technically a SG but I couldn’t find any other PG’s besides Kemba currently in the NBA) SG: Kevin Huerter SF: Danny Green PF: Carmelo Anthony C: Isaiah Stewart  Not an awful team you ask me. Probably gets a spot as a top 6 seed in the playoffs imo. Now, if you include the NYC metropolitan area than you could throw in Bam Adebayo, Karl Anthony Towns, Kyrie Irving and Jaren Jackson Jr. (all from north Jersey) and now this team is by far the best team in the NBA, but I decided not to do it since technically speaking they aren’t from NY and since it’d be pretty much impossible to afford all those players too being that would be 5 max contracts and a bunch of players making over the vet minimum, but god damn is the NYC metropolitan area stacked with talent now that I look into it."
Ah yeah. god damn that Thomas Bryant
"Which FMVP's have gotten a triple double:  Jerry West: yes Willis Reed: no Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: yes Wilt Chamberlain: yes John Havlicek: yes Rick Barry: yes Jo Jo White: no Bill Walton: yes Wes Unseld: yes Dennis Johnson: no Magic Johnson: yes Cedric Maxwell: yes Moses Malone: no Larry Bird: yes James Worthy: no Joe Dumars: no Isiah Thomas: yes Michael Jordan: yes Hakeem Olajuwon: yes Tim Duncan: yes Shaquille O'Neal: yes Chauncey Billups: yes Dwyane Wade: yes Tony Parker: yes Paul Pierce: yes Kobe Bryant: yes Dirk Nowitzki: yes LeBron James: yes Andre Iguodala: yes Kevin Durant: yes Kawhi Leonard: yes Giannis Antetokounmpo: yes  1) why did I do this 2) by my calculations, 33 different players have won FMVP 3) 6 of them have not recorded a triple double (18% of FMVPs)"
"You acquire draft picks to use in situations like this. Kawhi said he wasn’t coming if they don’t get him PG. It was pretty much a packaged deal for both of them. What team wouldn’t do that? You guys did that for AD. Shit you guys have been letting assets go for nothing the last few years. D’Angelo, randle, zubac, Lopez, Thomas Bryant, pretty much all let go for nothing.    He wanted a co star and they got him one in PG. Why would he care about draft picks when he’s trying to win now. Look at how useful all the draft picks are to curry. They tanked and thought the 2nd pick was gonna be a foundational piece but it doesn’t look like it.   Clips were looking like a title contender this year before kawhi got hurt. Before the nets formed their big 3, and now the lakers, they looked as talented as any team in the league."
Wizards had their injuries in the first part of the season. They finished 19-10 after picking up Daniel Gafford to *finally* replace Thomas Bryant who went down early.
"About a week ago someone on r/WashingtonWizards wondered if the Wizards should consider making an offer of Thomas Bryant, Aaron Holiday and Davis Bertans for Ben Simmons and someone else responded that they shouldn’t do that even if Philly was willing."
"Capela is my fucking guy some Ima give some runners up for similar builds and playstyles (not in order or even saying they aren’t basically on par with Capela)  Timelord, Thomas Bryant, Claxton,"
Trade AD to the Wizards for Davis Bertans and Thomas Bryant  Ignore my flair
They also drafted Thomas Bryant and gave it to us for pretty much nothing! Thinking about it he would actually be a good fit on the current Lakers rosters lol
"Thomas Bryant, Davis Bertans and a protected 1st."
"I don't really watch the Wizards much since they aren't on national TV. Would there be interest in Jerami Grant and if so, what would you guys give? Like theoretically would something like Thomas Bryant, Deni Avdija, and a protected first work in your mind? Not sure that works with the cap."
Davis Bertans and Thomas Bryant are close to returning as well
"that game was reffed horribly all around lmao. butler got every call in existence until right towards the end, and they missed a travel on Dinwiddie.   but a wonderful win for my wiz. came back from down 16 against a great Heat team. I can't wait to see what we look like once we get Bertans, Rui, and Thomas Bryant back. We already play 11 guys a night, we can go 13-14 deep once we're healthy"
Wouldn’t tell ya why but Thomas Bryant
"Michael, LeBron, Kareem, Bill Russell, Magic Johnson, Tim Duncan, Wilt Chamberlain, Larry Bird, Kobe Bryant, Jerry West, Kevin Durant, Hakeem Olajuwan, Shaquille O'Neal, Steph Curry, Oscar Robertson, Moses Malone, Dr. J, Dirk Nowitzki, Isiah Thomas, and Giannis Antetekoumpo makes 20."
Spencer Dinwiddie free agent pick up and we got got three good players in their primes from the Lakers for Westbrook and  two of them have championship experience. Deepest bench in the league and that's without Rui Hachimura and Thomas Bryant playing. Beal gets to score at all levels without the need to bail the team out all the time. Brooks is no longer the coach.
Wizards don’t even have Thomas Bryant and Rui Hachimura. They’re absolutely scared
"Dumb move, should have held on to Caruso. I think Pelinka has done a good job overall, but the list of players we've given up for nothing could make a pretty good squad...Randle, Brook Lopez, D'Lo, Caruso, Thomas Bryant, Gary Payton II, Dennis Schroeder, and David Nwaba. You gotta get SOMETHING for those assets. Not to mention the Westbrook trade, which has a chance to be Pelinka's Mozgov/Deng signing...the one move that unwinds years of otherwise solid work. I do like THT though, 3/$30M was a good deal."
"This is only how fans and media talk. When you hear players talk about who is the best player it is entirely different. Like Arenas when he redid the 75th anniversary thing. Pretty much completely negates championships, because they are team awards, and do very little to tell you how good an individual player is. They can be used for things like tiebreakers basically, or a little additional thing.   You can take LeBron and put him in the West and he isn't getting to the WCF or Finals every year. Maybe every other year, maybe. Maybe not. Does that suddenly make him not the best player in the world? Of course not. Does LeBron get bonus points from you for being able to cut through an extremely weak east and get to ECF and Finals, even though you know he wouldn't have been able to do that at a remotely similar rate in the West? I would hope not because it doesn't make any sense and is irrelevant to how good LeBron is at basketball.  CP3 was the best point guard in the world for a long time until Steph became MVP Steph. Wasn't getting to WCFs because his teams werent' capable of doing so. If CP3 wins a ring this year and a Finals MVP...it doesn't change how good of a player he is/was. He wouldn't even be approaching the levels of how well he played in his prime.   Last year Steph couldn't get into the playoffs. This year they're the #1 seed. Is Steph now a better player, just because of that? Of course not.   Prime Kobe Bryant for a 3 year stretch missed the playoffs and then got bounced out of the 1st round 3 times. Why? Because his team sucked. Not because Kobe suddenly lost all that 3peat power like the Monstars took it, and then all of a sudden Pau Gasol comes to down and brings Kobe's in a backpack to give him and then he starts winning again.  JR Smith went to 5 straight finals and won 2 rings. In that 5 year stretch was he better than Derozan? Of course not.  If a player plays amazing in the playoffs but has bad teams then that's all that means. It means the player is great, or the best player in the world, but the team may not be the 8th best team in the conference.   You've been suckered into the fairly recent trend of people going crazy about rings. For the vast majority of the NBA's history it was never, ever like that. Sure rings mattered, but winning was a team accomplishment. Nobody said Magic was better than Larry because he had 2 more rings. Nobody said Isiah Thomas was better than MJ when they were bouncing him out of the playoffs every year.   There are 4 other guys on the court with you at all times. This isn't tennis. It's not that wins and rings don't matter, they do matter, but sometimes they also don't matter at all.   Again, Jason Kidd lead his team to back to back finals as the lone all-star or all-nba guy. Kobe needed Shaq, McGrady didn't even get there. Was he better than them? A better basketball player?  From 88-92 Hakeem didn't even get past the 1st round. Was he not the best center in the league and one of the best players of all time those years? The man Averaged 38/17/2/2/3 on 57% shooting and 89% from the line and still lost 3-1 in the 1st round to the Mavs that year. What more do you want him to do? Is another player who played worse but got to the Finals better than Hakeem?   Was Sam Jones better than Jerry West because he was 9-1 against him in the Finals? No!  There are a million examples of this but it's one of the main reasons why players are annoyed by people talking like you are. It's meaningless. It shows a complete lack of understanding of the game of basketball, you're just looking at people's accomplishments and thinking that more wins, or more rings, means that they're better. Better resume better player. That just isn't how it works.   You can be the best player in the world and lose over and over. Oscar did it on the Royals when he was the best PG in the world. KG did it on the Wolves. Kobe was doing it on the Lakers for a bit.   You're doing yourself a disservice by simplifying basketball to the degree that you are. It makes it pretty unenjoyable to watch and you miss out on understanding what actually makes a player ""the best in the world"" when you're so tunnel visioned on a ring."
"the defense was better with Gafford on the floor, but I mean, expecting Thomas Bryant and Montrez Harrell to anchor your defense was optimistic at best, and Beal + Dinwiddie as your point of attack defenders with Bertans out there, I expected a lot of their lineups to be giving up a lot on defense.  I think they've benefited a lot from not playing Bryant and Bertans, and Rui not playing if we're being honest (he's still raw)."
The year before westbrook got there the wizards were no where close to the playoffs.  All they did was add westbrook and they lost Thomas Bryant for the year and made the playoffs.  Westbrook still an overall positive for that team as he works hard day in and day out
"There was so many more things that made the start of your season suck last year. Covid, literally every team hitting threes at one of the most obviously unsustainable rates I've ever seen over the first 15 games, losing Thomas Bryant, etc. Russ has definitely had an awful start to this season, but this is so revisionist lol."
"Better coaching a deeper team, and thats without Rui and Thomas Bryant. And Neto is a problem!"
Don't forget Thomas Bryant
What happens when Thomas Bryant comes back?
"- I mean we were 17-6 after we acquired Gafford last year. Much better than running Mo Wagner, Robin Lopez, and Alex Len.  - Westbrook lost us at least 5 games at the beginning of the season, and Scott Brooks probably lost us another 5-10 with his poor lineup managed, inability to coach in the last few minutes, and pure incompetence.  - We added Dinwiddie, KCP, Kuzma, Harrell ... in place of Westbrook, Matthews, Bonga/Hutchison, and Lopez/Len. Big boost in quality role players.   - We still haven't seen Thomas Bryant or Rui Hachimura this year.   - Bertans has been out awhile  - Beal has actually been playing like ass, we should get better when he's on form again."
"Wiz have a bright future with Kispert and Rui's development to look forward to.  Thomas Bryant could be another nice rotation guy if  he can figure out his defense, worst case he's a trade chip."
"Honestly too much to even fit in one post. Kuzma is really shining as a 3rd scoring option behind Beal and Dinwiddie, hell one could even argue he could be the 2nd scoring option. His defense is shining. We'll see if Bertans wakes up anytime soon and starts making 3s again, although I feel like we've seen some improvements with his off ball movement  So much development to keep track of too with a lot of young players to be excited about. Daniel Gaffords only 23, and when he got traded from the Bulls last season, that's when the Wizards defense really started honing in on a defensive presence in the paint. He plays super hard every minute too. Deni Avdija has been a huge surprise defensively as well, almost becoming our go to defender that can guard positions 1-5. He still has some work on the offensive side but I'm sure it'll come eventually, given his record in Tel Aviv.    And we still have Rui Hachimura who was also amazing last season on the defensive end, runs hard to finish at the rim, and developing a deadly mid-range game that can buy a bucket when we need it.   All of this new defense really opens it up for Thomas Bryant to bring his return too. A big knock on him has always been his defense, but if you have quality defenders in the 3 and 4 positions, and a long and tall Spencer Dinwiddie at PG, they can cover his gaps while he shoots from downtown and brings back his passion to the team.  Honestly there's just so much to be excited about with them this season."
They’re like 18th in SoS so fair point. Not the easiest but not the hardest. That argument can be applied to the Warriors as well since they have had the easiest SoS. But I would remind you the Wiz have gotten this record without Rui and Thomas Bryant as well as Spence not playing in a back to back with Beal missing some games.
"The least likely to win imo would be the wizards. Thomas Bryant ,Kuzma, rui hachumara, Bertrans, beal and Spencer.   Can't forget the Nets it's a retirement home except for kd. Kyrie can't show up, so 14v15. Joe Harris. Enough said lol"
Thomas Bryant was given away for free
Thomas Bryant hasn’t played this season yet.  But I’d assume when he comes back he’s gonna be behind Gafford (ur starting big who plays great defense) and Trezz (6MOTY candidate)  There’s no spot for Bryant on this team unfortunately.
"Um, pretty sure we've had some of the best drafting in the league when it comes to quality of talent.  Since 2014 we drafted Randle, DLo, Nance, Zubac, Ingram, Lonzo, Thomas Bryant, Hart, Lonzo, Kuzma, Mykhailiuk, Wagner, Caruso, and THT.  There are very few teams that have drafted that well in that same timespan."
"Ivica Zubac, Thomas Bryant, Svi Michalek, Mo Wagner…"
"Lakers drafted super well and that translated into the teams ability to trade for stars.  For shits and giggles, an LA all draft team would be fun. DLo, Lonzo, Ingram, Randle, Zubac starting 5, Kuz, Thomas Bryant, Hart and Nance on the bench.  Salaries wouldn’t work, but would be dope.  Mitch K doing the same thing over on the Hornets"
They have surprised me. Will be interesting to see the regression to the mean for the ECF hawks and Wizards. Wizards got a great depth when their roster is healthy. Let’s see how Thomas Bryant holds up when he comes back. Could make them a legitimate non playin team
"Amen. Love our former young core and I am glad that most of them are flourishing, even lesser known players such as Thomas Bryant, Svi, Bonga etc are carving their places in the league."
"Bertans is a plus for any team on the court(when you stop looking at his contract) in the NBA. Who provides more spacing then him in the league? Steph? Thats it. Also please have Rui come back and take KCP's minutes, because that man doesnt deserve more than 10. Also Thomas Bryant is an elite rim runner and finisher who shoots 40 for 3%. We also dont have fuckin IT ""walkin cone"" and Russell ""Revolving doors"" Westbrook at pg.   How tf that doesnt help the team? Man yall just talk shit for no reason"
"We gave up Zubac, Randle, and Thomas Bryant for a combined two months of Mike Muscala."
"Yup you’re absolutely right, however it is intriguing how many great prospects the Lakers have drafted in the last decade that went on to play decent minutes for other teams (obviously in order to trade for players like AD):  Julius Randle, Jordan Clarkson, Dangelo Russell, Larry Nance, Ivica Zubac, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Thomas Bryant, Kyle Kuzma, Josh Hart, Alex Caruso, Mo Wagner, Svi Mykhailiuk"
"Lol somehow this reminds me of [Blake Griffin laughing at Thomas Bryant after ""scuffle""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L29svzQGO_8)"
How are Kuz and Thomas Bryant doing?
"we also have bertans, beal, kispert, and kuzma. they are all decent to good shooters.  plus thomas bryant will come back and be a good stretch 5 like he's been all his career."
I can no longer just the players defensive ability while coached by Brooks. Thomas Bryant under new coaching has a clean slate.
I remember watching him and Thomas Bryant dominating in the G-League and was so hyped when Caruso got his 2-way.
Thomas Bryant shoots 40% from 3?
"As much as I hate to say it I think Thomas Bryant is kind of redundant now. Gafford's found new life as a rim-roller and Montrezl is a spark plug off of the bench. Bryant was a hell of a sharpshooter for a 5, but he was absolute ass on defense and I think it'll be worse coming off of an ACL tear."
"Forgot all about Thomas Bryant, he was coming along pretty well before he got hurt"
And former laker cast off Thomas Bryant
"And this is while missing Rui (arguably our 2nd or 3rd best player), Thomas Bryant (one of the league's most efficient big's), and Bertans (no comment)."
The wizards and the raptors split 1-1 and the wizards are also missing Rui and Thomas Bryant who are both 14-20 ppg
[Reminds me of this Thomas Bryant put back dunk into the wrong hoop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rsfF1rEkyA)
"I’m proud Thomas Bryant, Hachimura and Bertans are not even playing.  We don’t have a second top level scorer but the team is very deep.  We just need to fully develop Gafford, Hachimura and Avdija and this team is a contender."
"Davis Bertans, Thomas Bryant, and a 2nd. Deal, Celts fans?"
"He's wearing his favorite neon pink suit, looking real spiffy. He's super excited so he called his mom, and then his old friend Thomas Bryant. Bryant picks up a payphone somewhere in DC expecting the good news. Suddenly he starts crying and smashing the payphone. Nearby, his teammate Bradley Beal is concerned, ""TB, what's wrong?"" Through sobs TB chokes out, ""he's coming *here*"" Beal starts crying too."
Thomas Bryant will probably be on the trade block once he recovers from his knee injury from last year.  Should be playing again by the end of the month.  I predict the Wiz will be looking for guard help before the trade deadline.
Still figuring out how to play together too. Oh yea and we get Rui and Thomas Bryant back 💪
Completely forgot about Thomas bryant a MIP dark horse last year to start out the season and a monster for my fantasy basketball team before his season ending injury
"man someone really needs to save Jaylen and Jayson from the celtics.   maybe come over to the wizards for    thomas bryant , deni, and bertans, it will help the celtics rebuild and they can play with their friend Brad... maybe get a 3 way trade going and save jimmy butler from the heat while we're at it.   we'll toss in rui"

"On paper yes it's huge, but Thomas Bryant was a black hole defensively before his injury and he's coming off an ACL tear. The center rotation for the Wizards has a lot more offensive firepower but the defense in the Knicks' center rotation is rock solid and for that I'd probably go with them."
Our third string big right now is Thaddeus young. Him&gt;. Boban &gt;. Dwight &gt; Kanter&gt; Kaminsky (maybe) &gt; dieng(when Atlanta is healthy) &gt;  paschall &gt; Thomas Bryant
"And the wizards were one of the hottest teams down the stretch. Massively upgraded their coach, got rid of the biggest black hole in basketball, added Kuzma, Harrell, Kispert, Holiday, KCP and  Dinwiddie. Then will have Deni back as well as Thomas Bryant back.   Also Rui looked like he took a massive step forward if you watched the Olympics.   Then in the matchup with the knicks the Wizards have the best player in Beal."
"&gt;Oh that’s the reason the coaching is better? Is that why the Wizards fans were begging for Brooks to be fired before Russ even showed up? I’m sure because of Westbrook’s “low IQ” and “high volume,” Brooks was running three guard lineups with Ish Smith and Neto … right. But you watch though for sure.  This does nothing to argue in favour of Westbrook. He’s an inefficient player and the coach wasn’t good. Both of these things are true.  &gt;So the Wizards had a ORTG of 110 last year. Their offensive rating currently is … 106. Hmm. So that implies their offense was somehow better last year (or at least similar when you look at current rankings) than this year.  Their ORTG is so low because Beal has had a putrid start to the season. He’s averaging just 24 ppg on 45.3 TS% to start the season. He’s obviously not going to stay this bad for the whole year. He’s just shaking the rust off.  &gt;Currently their defensive rating is 102 (10th since that rating probably isn’t sustainable in general) compared to 112 (20th). You don’t actually think a guard defender has the ability to change a defense that much? 10+ ratings? Right…?  It’s gonna have that large of an impact?  You’re being disingenuous by asking “do you think a guard defender can have this much impact”.  You replaced one garbage tier guard defender (Westbrook) with an elite guard/*wing* defender (KCP) and another high level forward defender (Kuzma). Yes, I absolutely do believe that’s why the defence has improved.  &gt;And ahh, 6 games without Rui and Thomas Bryant versus the entirety of the Wizards teams literally not being able to practice for weeks because of COVID.   6 games is all we have to base conclusions off.  &gt;Or Westbrook himself getting injured,   Westbrook played the vast majority of the season. 65/72 games, literally 90% of the season.   &gt;Beal being in and out  Beal played 83% of the season.  &gt;them not having GAFFORD until the SECOND HALF of the season when they actually were good. Deni and Bertans being out a bunch. But, you watch the Wizards, so you should know that’s a false equivalency… right?  You’re getting worked up over nothing. A team’s improvement can stem from multiple sources. Yes, I’m sure being slightly healthier is impacting the Wizard’s current success. That doesn’t change the fact that Westbrook is the *main* reason holding the Wizards back. There’s a reason literally every team he goes to gets worse.  &gt;You don’t watch the Washington Wizards and you didn’t last year.   Ahh there it is.  &gt;Your entire post was a commentary about Westbrook, nothing you mentioned had to do with the coaching schemes or roleplayers or circumstances of the Wizards last year.   Objectively untrue. I very clearly mentioned KCP and Kuzma being large defensive upgrades over Westbrook. Stop being disingenuous.   You’re getting defensive over nothing. Congratulations on having a decent coach. It really is something to be happy about. But saying Westbrook is bad doesn’t diminish the coaching upgrade. Like I said, both things can be true.  &gt;Why? Because you don’t have the context to do so. Stop trying to flex fake knowledge about a team you clearly know very little about and stick with the same “meh meh Westbrook bad” memes instead 🤡  Westbrook is bad, and anybody who understands basketball at even a rudimentary level knows this. You’re using emotions to argue against objective facts."
"Oh that’s the reason the coaching is better? Is that why the Wizards fans were begging for Brooks to be fired before Russ even showed up? I’m sure because of Westbrook’s “low IQ” and “high volume,” Brooks was running three guard lineups with Ish Smith and Neto … right. But you watch though for sure.   Wait let’s talk about defense.

"It’s always funny to see Westbrook apologists grasp at straws to deny something that should be common knowledge to anybody who understands basketball at even a basic level.   The reason the coaching looks better is because it’s much, much easier to coach low usage players like Kuz, KCP, and Trez than it is to coach Russell Westbrook. What can a coach say to a low IQ player who insists on shooting a high volume of shots despite being one of the most inefficient scorers in the league?  Is he a better coach than Brooks? Probably. Would Unseld Jr. be able to turn Westbrook into an effective player? Absolutely not. **We’re talking about a guy who shot *under* 40% from the field in 4/5 of the last postseasons he participated in**. The guy exists to waste possessions and be an inefficient player.  And that isn’t even mentioning his defence. For as much shit as he got, Kuzma really stepped up his defence the last few years. KCP has always been a good defender. Replacing a garbage tier defender with two positive ones is obviously going to have a large impact.  For all your talk of injuries: Rui Hachimura and Thomas Bryant haven’t even touched the floor.  If you can come up with a response other than “I watch games and you don’t 🤪” I’d love to hear it. I watch all teams. I just turn off the Westbrook blinders when doing so."
Lack of playmaking? Beal/Dinwiddie are proven playmakers?   Then you have Thomas Bryant who is a 20-10 machine. Rui who can get you points. Bertans who can randomly blow up.  Kuzma can create his own shot.   Scoring is not an issue with this team at all
"SleepyB, DLo, Jules, Zubac, Svi, Thomas Bryant, Caruso, Kuzma, Hart  3 Allstars and the rest solid/great role players. I won't be upset when we're tanking post LBJ cause our scouting dept is top notch."
"Hachimura, Thomas Bryant, and missed Gafford this game too! we’re hella deep this year"
"Didn’t expect him to perform this well to be honest. Love the energy, love Thomas Bryant for the same reason even with his shortcomings"
Where is Thomas Bryant steal for  42 pick
"Westbrook was playing injured early season, Lavine missed 2 more games than Beal, Thomas Bryant tore his acl 23 games in, Ish Smith missed 2 month, they only had Gafford for 23 games, Bertans missed 15 games. But, sure, continue telling me how everything went perfect for the Wizards."
"Larry Nance, Clarkson, Kuzma, Caruso, THT, Josh Hart, Zubac, and Thomas Bryant were all later picks (or undrafted in Caruso's case). That's a pretty good track record."
I Forgot about Thomas Bryant
"&gt;Lakers drafted **Randle, Clarkson, Nance, Ingram**, Lonzo, Kuzma, Hart, Zubac, Thomas Bryant, **Caruso** and THT  Those guys were drafted before the time period OP highlighted."
"Lakers drafted Randle, Clarkson, Nance, Ingram, Lonzo, Kuzma, Hart, Zubac, Thomas Bryant, Caruso and THT"
The Wizards should only get better once Rui and Thomas Bryant are back.
technically Thomas Bryant is a Laker too.  Lakers spend a year or two developing promising young guys and just ship them over to the Wizards. I can’t complain.
Imagine when Thomas (better than Zubac) Bryant comes back  Enjoy the playoffs Wiz. Fuck the Celtics
Ayy don’t forget Thomas Bryant homie; dudes getting like $9 mil a season with the wizards lol
All because AD didn't want to play center  Wiz aren't even in their final form. Just wait until former baby Laker Thomas (Better than Zubac) Bryant comes back
"yeah we’re currently still missing Rui and Thomas Bryant. Pretty crazy how much depth we have this year, it was out of nowhere.   last year our bench was ish smith, garrison matthews, troy brown jr, bertans, and robin lopez"
You'll also get Thomas Bryant around December right?
and Thomas Bryant is still out
Tommy Sheppard was able to turn John Wall’s contract into one of the deepest teams in the NBA.  And the team will be even deeper with Rui Hachimura and Thomas Bryant coming back.
Thomas Bryant should be back in a little while too. Might as well pencil him in for 20 as well.
"Embiid absolutely destroyed Thomas Bryant.  Bryant would be an amazing big off the bench, but he just isn't cut out to be a starting center in the league.  He's an atrocious rim protector and bad post defender, and doesn't have great discipline.  The Wizards defensive struggles the past couple years coincide with him moving to a starting role."
He's engaged this year and looks 15 lbs lighter in less fat.   Thomas Bryant is helping your cause but he's been that dominant to start the season. He's an MVP candidate so far.
"It took weirdly long for him to figure out that Thomas Bryant would bite on every single fake he gave him, but after that it was too easy. Embiid also had some nasty post moves in the second quarter — not sure anyone can guard him when he's on like this. Wizards also seemed more hesitant to double than most teams, probably because everyone else was cooking."
Started 0-6 and looked out of control. Then just flipped the switch and said “im making thomas bryant my bitch”   MVP performance out of the big fella
Thomas Bryant is so ass
Thomas Bryant is garbage. Dude thinks with his temper more than anything else
Thomas Bryant literally wears moon shoes with how often he goes for pump fakes
Thomas Bryant has never committed a foul in his life
You could replace Thomas Bryant with a chair and I wouldn’t notice a difference
"The Lakers have missed the playoffs 11 times total since 1947, have been to more finals than any other team, have won more titles than any other team, and have a reputation over decades of taking care of their stars.   If that's not well run, I don't know what the fuck is. The Lakers are probably the most consistently well run sports franchise in America over the last 40 years.   You idiots latch on to the 5 years the team was bad after the team's franchise player had a career-ending injury and they were tanking to judge the franchise lmao, it's hilarious.   Even then, the assets the team acquired while they were bad were all attractive pieces that helped the team get a star. Jordan Clarkson is a rotation player. Brandon ingram is a future star. Josh Hart is good. Lonzo Ball is good. Larry Nance is good. Randle is good. Zubac was good. Moe Wagner is good. Thomas Bryant is good.   Alex Caruso was developed from a g-leaguer to a fantastic rotation player.  Talen-Horton Tucker is good. The Lakers' scouting found all these guys. Is that not part of being well run? Any team could have had any of those guys and used them.  The Lakers drafted well and made good trades to get out from the terrible Mozgov and Deng contracts. They didn't get a single free agent meeting when they were terrible. Only once ownership changed and the team improved did they even have a chance at LeBron. The league is a meritocracy; when the Lakers were bad they couldn't even get a meeting with LaMarcus fucking aldridge of all people.   You guys shat on all the moves Pelinka made last off-season and look what happened? The team won a title and was built extraordinarily well. Then he turns around and makes smart moves *again* to make the team better.   I'm not trying to hear any salty fucking nonsense about the Lakers not being well run. This isn't Mitch Kupchak and Jimmy Buss' regime anymore. The new management has consistently made the right decisions and turned the team around. The scouting department hit on pick after pick after pick. Keep holding on to those 4 or 5 years when the team was bad because you're showing your age. The Lakers have consistently been excellently well run, and it will continue now that Pelinka and Jeanie ousted those fucking bozos."

"Lakers traded him to the rocket for Corey Brewer  and a first.  That first wound up being 28, which the Lakers traded to the jazz for picks 30 and 46.  Selected Josh Hart at 30 and Thomas Bryant at 46.    I don't really care that he once played for the lakers haha.  They have Harrell now so that's who I'm worried about."
stop insulting Thomas Bryant like that
Okay now this is ridiculous obviously its Thomas Bryant
Thomas Bryant
"KAT has shot a much higher volume and efficiency than Bryant in his career from 3pt range, is a much better rebounder and still gets shit on for his lackluster defense.  Thomas Bryant is just a very poor man's version of KAT"
Thomas Bryant is the next Kobe
Talking and communicating is the most important fundamental aspect of defense in ALL SPORTS. And it’s still blown off. Thomas Bryant doesn’t do this and the Wiz’ defense is not good.  Draymond is speaking 100% truth and Wiseman will be a defensive beast if he listens and learns from Dray
"I've only caught Wiz games so I can't speak for other teams.   But Thomas Bryant has been impressive ever since the bubble. He has added strength and he is an absolute offensive weapon, not sure there are many centers who are better than him on that end right now.   His defense is absolutely terrible, but it's going to improve with our team defense once we fire Brooks and get some actual NBA caliber coaching."
"He had the lane. I mean I guess his judgement would overrule mine, but still, he kinda bailed out Thomas Bryant lol."
"&gt; and only 2 TOs  Russ when he limits his turnovers leads to winning more often than not, even if his shot selection is a bit poor. He's always good for hustle, energy, leadership, and assists. Also a great rebounder.  Also liking Thomas Bryant at least on offense (and energy).  Imagine once Bertans gets into a groove things will get better too.  Rui looks like he's continuing to develop well. And so far, Neto's been surprisingly much better/efficient compared to his previous seasons.  RoLo kinda looks like a husk out there."
Jarrett Allen is properly rated maybe even overrated. He got bullied by Thomas Bryant and Robin Lopez last game.

"Clarkson , kuzma, thomas bryant , we always get good value"
First time watching a full game of the Wizards this season and I can not believe how horrid Westbrook mid-range game has evolved into even a WORST way than before. Taking so many forced and out of rythm shots was making me nuts.  And then Beal had a cold game... And Hachimura was really weak on defense... And still won! I guess Thomas Bryant is their alpha dog now! He played like a beast
"&gt;testament to their scouting  Now list Thomas Bryant, Larry Nance Jr., Josh Hart, Zubac, THT, Clarkson, Svi...all starting level to legit rotational pieces in the league picked in the late 1st to 2nd round. Discrediting scouting because of one #2 pick is laughable. Lonzo was also a consensus #2 pick. You can't have it both ways."
Thomas Bryant GOAT
"I know there are a couple of players named Bryant and it is probably just me, but it is odd seeing ""Bryant"" in a title and it is not talking about Kobe.   I will have to get used to it. Usually when it is about Thomas Bryant, his full name is used, so that's why this threw me off a little."
Yes KD is terrified of Thomas fucking Bryant 🙄
"No matter what... the win today over brooklyn was a great game by Rui, Thomas Bryant, Bertans and Russ/Beal. The starters got the job done against a tough team. The wizards played the best game of the season tonight"
THOMAS MOTHERTRUCKING BRYANT IS WHY!
"They were playing the 1-5 Wizards. The same Wizards that had sophomore Rui Hachimura guarding Durant and Thomas ""2nd worst defensive center in the league"" Bryant."
Thomas Bryant MIP
Thomas Bryant was amazing those last few possessions
Who's your favorite center in the league and why is it Thomas Bryant?
thomas bryant carrying these idiots lmao
Thomas bryant is outplaying both nets centers. Sheesh
Thomas bryant is having a ridiculous (offensive) season. He's only missed like 2 shots the last couple games
Thomas Bryant getting hyped makes my day!
Jesus if only thomas bryant was decent at defense. He's absolutely elite on the offensive end. Similar to montrezl Harrell
Thomas Bryant is a power forward we insist on playing as a Center
Lol Thomas Bryant is getting abused
Thomas bryant is buckets.
Haaaaave you met Thomas Bryant?
KD and Thomas Bryant would make the ugliest child ever
"Thomas Bryant is not what you wanna use as a good example tbf. Dude is a black hole on defense, has attitude problems and just seems sloppy from what I've seen."
"Thomas Bryant, Svi, Zubac, Alex Caruso (Undrafted), Mo Wagner, etc. I don’t think they have a single miss in like six years in the sense that many of them are still playing solid minutes on NBA rosters."
"The late picks our scouts did is the testament. Larry Nance, Kuzma, Jordan Clarkson, Svi and Thomas Bryant. Those are all rotation pieces on teams rn much more compared to other teams."
"&gt;Thinking the Lakers had they not brought in LeBron would be a playoff team in the West is preposterous.  It's not remotely.  They were 12 games out of playoff spot in 2018 -- starting two 20 year-olds, and one each 22, 23, and 24.  Only 1 player over 25 played over 700 minutes for that team -- Brook Lopez.  That was one of the youngest NBA teams in recent history, when weighted by minutes-played.  They were barely older than a college team.  They also had 20 year-old Ivica Zubac and 20 year-old Thomas Bryant.  They traded Zubac to make room for Davis, and he immediately started for the playoff-bound Clippers.  Bryant is starting in Washington -- who are not a playoff team, but he'd certainly be a capable backup.  They also would've had plenty of cap space to re-sign Brook Lopez, who is also capable of starting on a playoff team.  Plus Ingram, Randle, Ball, Caldwell-Pope, Hart, Kuzma, Caruso, Clarkson, and Hunter -- all guys currently playing well for various teams.  Or, they could package some of those assets -- with the 3 firsts and second round picks they used on Davis -- to acquire other players.  For just two examples, they had more disposable assets than Miami needed to trade for Jimmy Butler and still had more than Indiana needed to trade for Malcolm Brogdon.  Just to name two very good players who have recently been on the trade market for much, much less than the Lakers spent on one season of Davis.  They were on their way back to playoffs, even without James -- exactly because of the original topic here, they drafted very well year after year, and that left them with a wealth of young assets."
Zubac and Thomas Bryant too!
"Yeah but they've also hit on a few lower picks and got solid players at the bottom. Zubac, Thomas Bryant, Alex Caruso, Josh hart and Kyle kuzma are all guys they've found who have become solid players in the NBA. And that's just from the past few years. Admittedly Josh hart and Thomas Bryant were draft day trades but still. Credit where credit is due, Lakers scouting department is elite."
I cant tell if this is Rui Hachimura to Thomas Bryant or what XD
"He has the worst head coach in the league, and probably the worst defensive roster in the league too. When Russ is on the court with Raul Neto, Ish Smith, Troy Brown, and Thomas Bryant for stretches of time.... How are they expected to score more points than they give up? Whatever Russ and Beal do at one end is immediately negated at the other end. They're what people thought the Hawks would be this year on defense lol"
"I’m biased, but I think it’s crazy that the Wizards are paying Thomas Bryant like $8.3m dollars for the amount of offensive usage he brings."
"Deni looked amazing on both sides of the ball, great to see. Raul Neto deserves every single minute that Ish Smith gets. Thomas Bryant looks great on offence, but might be the worst defensive center I’ve ever seen. And the team looks way better when Bertans is hitting shots and Rui is doing what he does."
"Russell Westbrook isn't a very good player.  He likes to average high rebs, so on defense all he does is camp out under the rim so he can siphon rebounds. Sometimes he literally pulls them out of much taller team mates' hands. It's gotten to the point where 6'11"" Thomas Bryant will literally pull away from the rim to make room for 6'3"" Westbrook to run in and grab it. That's Russell's idea of ""defense"".  On offense he yells and screams for people to break out of their scheme so that they can set a screen for him to do something flashy. As a result he often gets assists, but he's almost equally likely to turn the ball over.   What they should be doing is bombing a ton of threes by Bertans, Bryant and Beal. Or attacking the rim. Instead they often end up watching Russ throw in a long range bomb (his 3 ball is truly a horrific shot) or hoist up bricks from mid range. There's often a wide open corner three passed up so that Russ can launch an ill advised heroball shot.  Beal is 28 and Westbrook is 32, and other than that their main group of guys are all much younger and less experienced. It doesn't help matters that Beal isn't all that engaged or smart on defense.   It's a team that will generally need 120 points to win a game. And sometimes even that won't be enough.  Probably the worst defensive team in the league and maybe at best average on offense."
"He better. I got him on my fantasy team this year, as well as thomas bryant"
I can tell you one thing - Thomas Bryant is hella underrated.
Thomas Bryant has missed one shot in the last two games and he was hacked on that shot
"I like the all-offense no-defense bigs like Thomas Bryant. Very fun to watch on lineups like this where they have a ton of space to work with.  Also Wizards should just make Avdija the point guard, he plays with a very cool head and sees the court super well. Better shooter than he looked pre-draft too. Slow down the pace, let them operate with screens and cuts"
thomas bryant is fucking awful  although he is a nets killer
"The study was mentioned in this article: [https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/playoffs/2019/06/14/kevin-durant-achilles-injury-recovery-nba-finals/1447053001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/playoffs/2019/06/14/kevin-durant-achilles-injury-recovery-nba-finals/1447053001/)  What I found crazy is of all the players to come in and out of the NBA in the past 3 decades only 45 (including Boogie) have torn their achilles. I wasn't able to get all of them, but I can list a few off hand:  Kobe Bryant   Isiah Thomas   Dominique Wilkins   Brandon Jennings  Anderson Varejao  Chauncey Billups  Wesley Matthews  Patrick Ewing  Rudy Gay   Demarcus Cousins (not included in study)"
Nice to see Thomas Bryant dunking on the right rim.
"22 points on 20 shots. 2-8 from 3. Not even a triple double. And he's clear?   Russ is making Thomas Bryant look like Hakeem offensively, imagine how good he would make Wood look."

"they really need to make some trades and try to build their depth especially in the front court. Thomas Bryant has been hustling his ass off and shown real promise but he still may be suited better as a reserve C idk but after him their depth at the big man is weak....Bertans can shoot but inconsistently and that all he looks to do, Lopez is like decent off the bench but cant sustain good value in big minutes and basically thats their big men . . . Gafford on the bulls is a solid rotation big but last night he looked like a beast against the trash Wizards bigs"
