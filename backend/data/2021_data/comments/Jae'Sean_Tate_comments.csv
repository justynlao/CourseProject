Christian Wood for Most Improved and Jae'Sean Tate for All-Rookie 1st Team let's goooo....    And maybe Silas for Coach of the Year
"They were 3rd string guys who played some second string minutes because of injury. Mason Jones and Jae'Sean Tate look like they could start on Tuesday, and Kenyon Martin Jr would arguably be the most exciting rookie we've had since Sam Dekker if if weren't for the two in front of him."
"Team: Rockets  Rookie: Jae'Sean Tate  How have they looked?: Pretty good so far, could definitely be our starting SF for years to come.   Rookie: Mason Jones  How have they looked?: also pretty good, shooting well and putting up some good stats, could be our next starting SG for years or a good 6th man   Rookie: Kenyon Martin Jr.  How have they looked?: meh   Rookie: Brodric Thomas  How have they looked?: BAD, everytime he's on the court is horrible"
"They should unless injuries somehow get worse than they already have been.  They've emerged looking good from the toughest part of their schedule with about a third to half of their team out on basically every given night.  OP didn't even list Eric Gordon, Danuel House, Jae'Sean Tate, David Nwaba and Sterling Brown who have all proven to be very solid depth pieces... Plus, BOOGIEEE!"

"Stolen from u/dhighway61:  The year is 2023. The Rockets have just come off a deflating loss in the WCF.  Wood averaged 30/12 throughout the playoff run. Sterling Brown put up a career playoff high of 54 in game 7, but it wasn't quite enough, as they lose in overtime. Jae'Sean Tate led all playoff players in triple doubles.   Your phone goes off. It's a twitter notification. Shams reports that the Rockets have signed James Harden to a veteran's minimum deal. He's coming back.  He brings his championship experience to the locker room and the court. The Rockets go 74-8 en route to a 4-4-4-4 sweep in the playoffs.   Never underestimate the heart of a champion."
"Good thing we got Christian ""Mini AD"" Wood and Jae'sean ""Mini Draymond"" Tate."

"Guys, I think Jae'Sean Tate might drive left."
"Christian Wood, Jae'Sean Tate, and Sterling Brown are gonna be held out next game for sore elbows."
"He's not wrong. I wasn't expecting him to be so blunt about it, but watching their games he's 100% not wrong. He may have missed camp, partied at strip clubs w/o masks on, but when he stepped on the court he showed up to play and he did. And it wasn't enough. The roster around him doesn't fit either, at least not with his timeline/age. Wood's gonna need more time to develop, Wall looks pretty good for someone coming off so much time off and the injuries, but Boogie's washed. And the rest of the roster just isn't going to get it done. At this point I feel like Jae'Sean Tate is the most promising player they have lol. For this Frankenstein roster to gel and develop, it'll take too much time and Harden doesn't have that much time left."
"Pass probably, but Jae'Sean Tate gave me some hesitation"
Jae'Sean Tate?
"Maybe it's just become repetitive. Now that he's playing w/ Christian Wood, John Wall, and the corpse of Boogie w/ a different coach, it's become interesting again. It also seems like he kinda likes that rookie Jae'Sean Tate kid."
"As currently constructed yeah WCF loss is HOU's realistic ceiling imo.  If they can get an interior defender tho, I think they're a top 5 team in the league no question.  After replenishing draft capital this offseason, they could look to move EG + picks for a big defender, especially if Jae'Sean Tate continues to develop well."

"It's really tough to say because like I said, it's a real lost art. If you sort by cutting action frequency, everyone ahead of Bruce Brown is a PF/C (which means their cuts are usually just coming from the paint area while Brown has to time his cuts from way further out usually). Juan Toscano-Anderson caught my eye from watching random Warriors games but I haven't seen enough to know if he's consistently great at it and I have similar observations about Brandon Clarke and Jae'Sean Tate but Warriors, Grizzlies, and Rockets fans can probably really tell it better than I can from watching the occasional League Pass games of each team."
"Robert Covington is the best example, he's so so so good as an help defender for a forward, but on ball he's almost powerless wether it's against guards or power wings.  On the other end of the spectrum guys like OG Anonoby or Lou Dort are absolute lockdown on ball, but not that special as help defenders.  &amp;#x200B;  If I had to do top 5 I'd say on ball (perimeter players only):  1. OG Anunoby 2. Ben Simmons 3. Lou Dort 4. Marcus Smart 5. Kawhi  Off Ball/help defender  1. Smart 2. Simmons 3. Tatum 4. Covington 5. Mikal Bridges  Lebron can be the best off ball defender when he's into it, I won't lie I haven't really watched him enough this season to say how he's been, also possible that Kawhi has slept and I just didn't notice, kudos to Royce O'Neal (on ball), Dejounte Murray (on and off the ball), Thybulle (off ball, didn't include him in the top 5 because he doens't play enough for me, but could be THE best), Jrue (on ball), Kyle Anderson (off ball), Jae'Sean Tate (on ball), Wiggins (on ball).  &amp;#x200B;  I'm sure that I forgot a big name"
"You could also make an undrafted team from that draft of Kendrick Nunn, Duncan Robinson, Kenrich Williams, Jae'Sean Tate and one of Yuta/McLaughlin/Gabriel."
Jae'Sean Tate?
Jae'Sean Tate
Have you heard of my guy Jae'Sean Tate?
"Lamelo was not from Europe. He played in Lithuania, sure, but he was younger then, and underperformed in spotty minutes.  His most recent season had been in the Australian NBL, the same league Jae'Sean Tate was MVP in. Even within that league, which is tricky to evaluate vs college Lamelo didn't shoot well at all"
"It's crazy how teams just skip over guys years into their careers, then when given a shot - show that they're invaluable pieces to a team. Juan was in the G-League for years, Jae'Sean Tate was playing in Sydney Australia while everyone was fawning over Lamelo."
Jae'Sean Tate and Christian Wood and nothing you make up will be believable.
"Don't think Blake Griffin would get that. Jae'Sean Tate just came over from the NBL, is starting on the Rockets and only got 4m per year.  Anyways I'm not really sure what you're arguing here when you've open admitted that you haven't seen the guy play."
"First Team: Lamelo Ball, Tyrese Haliburton, Immanuel Quickley, Patrick Williams, James Wiseman   Second Team: Cole Anthony, Desmond Bane, Anthony Edwards, Devin Vassell, Jae'Sean Tate"
"If we go by who actually contribute to winning some guys might not even deserve to be on one of those 2 teams, like you can easily argue that guys like Jae'Sean Tate or Xavier Tillman helps a team more than Wiseman or Edwards right now, but all rookie teams are more about PPG than any other thing at this point fairly or not"
It just means Jae'sean Tate needs to grow a big ass beard
"I think Jae'Sean Tate should be way higher, I know that the ROY is basically a ""PPG"" award but he is a way better player than some of the guys higher than him"
Jae'Sean Tate for MVP!
"He's still great.  in no order OG Anunoby, Mikal Bridges, Marcus Smart (yeah he's a wing and a guard at the same time), Simmons, Jae'Sean Tate, Lebron, Dort, Butler, and him would be my top 9, I just chose 9 because I just woke up and I'm sure I forgot somebody good."

"""A player"" != ""Davis"".  That was an example to illustrate the point.  But if you cannot understand that, here's a more concrete illustration.  On [January 27th](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/202101270PHI.html), Davis went 0 for 3 from the arc, in a 1-point loss to the 76ers.  He also went 9 for 15 from inside the arc, so each of those missed threes was a gift to Philadelphia.  That's not even to mention the knock-on effects, such as how much hanging out at the arc reduces Davis' offensive rebounding utility.  There is no earthly reason why Anthony Davis should be down around 40th in the league in ORB%, barely ahead of Jae'Sean Tate."
It also took me way too long to realize Jae'Sean Tate was a player and not just the houston announcer pronouncing Jayson Tatum in a southern accent
"How is it this close?  The Rockets have played Kevin Porter Jr., Ben McLemore, Sterling Brown, Jae'Sean Tate, Justin Patton, Kenyon Martin Jr., Anthony Lamb, David Dwaba, and Mason Jones tonight...against the team with the best record in the league that's playing at full strength."
"Brunson is obvious, yeah? Mitchell Robinson seems obviously better. I'd rather have Devonte' Graham. Gary Trent is obvious. Bruce Brown seems obvious. I can see where you might not be a Jarred Vanderbilt guy, but I am. I love Melton. Hamidou Diallo is better. Shake is better. Duncan Robinson was part of that class and went undrafted. So were Kendrick Nunn and Jae'Sean Tate and Kenrich Williams."

Y'all should be up 30 and Gobert should easily have a 20/20 game..."
Jae'sean Tate has been giving us solid minutes and is grading out as one of the top 3 players from this draft.
"Why can't he take credit for KPJ? He's improved from last year, particularly as a playmaker. Sterling Brown is having a career year. Jae'sean Tate and Kenyon Martin have shown promise. Christian Wood has made the leap to full time starter. Only player that has flopped is Daniel House."
"This year, with all the covid issues and lack of a preseason, I think if a rookie flashes, it's really showing something. That's how someone like Jae'Sean Tate, who has been playing pro ball overseas for a long time and came in prepared, can have a better rookie year than a lot of guys with a lot more potential, because he didn't need summer league or practice to get acclimated.   I'm sure there are a lot of rookies who have had years similar to Nesmith. He struggled to get minutes early, and when he did looked totally lost. The one thing he thought he could lean on, his three point shooting, wasn't clicking and that probably caused a lot of confidence issues.   After settling in, though, and this is probably an overreaction to the past week or two, he looks like he's gonna be a really solid player. He's showing a more diversified offensive game and pairing that with heady defense and athleticism. Seems like a great three and d guy with the ability to be a tertiary playmaker. Too early to say whether he has more potential than that, like all star potential, but he looks like he could someday be a starter on a championship team and that's exciting.   I think rookies need a lot more slack this year, and some young guys may really surprise us in the playoffs because they haven't had the time or stability to show us stuff rookies normally can in a full year."
"John Wall, KPJ, Jae'Sean Tate, Kelly Olynyk, Christian Wood  *Could become* a good starting 5."
And JAE'SEAN TATE
"i swear i'm not just saying this because i like jae'sean tate but it's anthony edwards for me  before i get pushback let me make it clear that he's very good for a rookie! he is! but i still think people are actively overrating him based on stuff like The Dunk and his other highlight dunks etc. when honestly every time i watch him (which is more frequent than you might expect, cause i love the t-wolves announcers) i just don't understand how people so heavily overrate the player he is *right now* (not who he might become, which is a very scary player and all-time freak athlete) with his horrific efficiency. As he is rn it's the definition of empty stats. :/"
"Jae'Sean Tate, undrafted to a potential rookie of the year finalist"
Jae'Sean Tate.  Undrafted to first team all-rookie.
I kinda like it though. you'd think someone else would've accumulated the stats at some point besides just LeBron playing like 38 mpg and Jae'Sean Tate lmao
"Honestly think ROY should be Jae'sean Tate. LaMelo has missed a ton of games, Wiseman/Edwards as you alluded to are having rough seasons.   Tate has a positive net rating on the worst team in the NBA. He's played every game this year. Good TS% and advanced stats love him. Only knock is he isn't a first option. But with all the first options sans LaMelo not doing great I think Tate should be getting more love."
ROTY favorite is Jae'Sean Tate though.
"&gt;Dont need inneficient high usage LeVert taking KPJ’s shots  Levert FG percentage: 43.3%, Levert True shooting: 52.24%  Porter Jr. FG percentage: 41.4%, Porter Jr. True shooting: 50.16%  &gt;besides, he doesnt fit our timeline  Levert is 26. How long are the Rockets planning to be bad for? Christian Wood and Jae'sean Tate are 25 btw. Do 30 year olds Olynyk and Bradley on expiring contracts fit the Rockets' timeline? You're in denial lol."

"I think it's technically considered a rookie contract (same goes for guys like Jae'Sean Tate), but either way it's a bargain"
"In the short term I think so. He plays with a chip on his shoulder and has stated before that he wants to prove he's worth a max contract at the end of this contract, this team gives him a great opportunity for that because he will be very key in the offense. I'm not sure he will get the same opportunity to be quite as involved on a competing team. I don't know that his primary goal is winning a championship right now as much as proving himself as a player. One more season of development/tanking I don't think will bother him. He'll also be just about to turn 28 at the end of his contract which is a perfect timeline for him to earn a max if he's ever going to.   But that third and final season of his contract could be key, the 22-23 season. If we don't start showing signs by then of at least being on track to become a playoff team then I wouldn't be surprised at him leaving to go elsewhere at the end of his contract. And really at that point if he's indicating that, we should consider trading him because his bird rights will be very valuable to a competing team, not to mention the potential playoff boost he'd give for that season without having to match much salary to get him. My hope as a Rockets fan is that we are looking good at that point between the hopefully top 4 rookie we draft this year and our young guys developing.  The 22-23 season is going to be huge for us in general. Wood, Kevin Porter Jr, and Jae'Sean Tate will all be up and they are right now basically our future core. We'll also have a ton of cap room because John Wall will be finally off the books and Eric Gordon's contract goes unguaranteed so we could cut him if we wanted."
"It's mostly the people defending the NBA/Lebron for no consequences who are using the term ""suspension"" than people who believe Lebron should be in health and safety protocols for ~5 days. I believe people are doing this to obfuscate the normal actions by the NBA for similar situations.   If the NBA is consistent, Lebron would only be in protocols for 5 days, miss only Sunday's game, and be fine for the rest of the series. Most NBA teams and players have had to deal with stricter protocols with less risk throughout the season.   The NBA accepted the Lakers' and Lebron's explanation that everyone was vaccinated and tested despite not conducting an investigation like they have with other players where there were public accusations of violating protocols. The NBA actually stated Lebron violated the protocols.   You have had many players, to include stars, who have had to miss playing time and time with the team to practice and conduct workouts due to health and safety protocols. These include players with previous covid infections and those vaccinated. Even vaccinated players still have to get tested prior to games, they only suspended testing between games for vaccinated players. That's how you get some random one day health and safety protocols due to a false positive from a rapid test for KPJ's teammate Jae'sean Tate.   A lot of teams, both playoff and lottery teams as well as stars and non-names have had to deal with rather strict protocols. These include restrictions on sponsorships and promotions that were only recently lifted for those vaccinated. Lebron violates the protocols, NBA acknowledges the violations, NBA does not conduct an investigation like they have on other players, and waive the normal requirement of 5 days health and safety protocols with 3 negative tests like they have with other NBA players to include ones that have already been infected with covid prior.   Every case is unique, but there is no unique case where the NBA completely waived their standards for public violations."
"When you cherrypick 40 games of an 11 season career to validate a point made a decade ago. And then it's not valid.  Whose growth has he inhibited in Houston? Breakout player Christian Wood? Future all-rookie Jae'Sean Tate? Oh, probably Kenyon Martin Jr, who scores 77% of his buckets off assists."
"Ironic, Jae'Sean Tate leads the Rockets in total minutes played and is an undrafted rookie.   Both are played at such high minutes for ~~tanking~~ player development purposes."
Congrats also to Jae'Sean Tate who might be the first undrafted rookie in the modern NBA to lead his team in total minutes in his first season (by a looong mile).
"There is absolutely no way I am taking RJ Hampton over Deni Avdija. Deni is the youngest player in the class and has been utilized in a really poor way by Brooks. Isaiah Stewart should also be above Hampton, he's been excellent this season.  Definitely would take Quickley over Okoro/Poku. He's shown way too much as a contributor on a playoff team already. Also probably a couple guys to take over Nwora including Jae'Sean Tate and Saben Lee"
It's hard to reach 72 games this season. Jae'Sean Tate only missed it because of a false positive though.
Like who?   Just saw your flair and was reminded of Jae'sean Tate. Who I would definitely put above Joe at least.  Who else am I missing?
"It should matter if it's close, like honestly it wasn't close between Brogdon and Embiid that one year.  I'm also more or less okay if ""best rookie"" isn't most valuable rookie, because it's hard for a rookie to be valuable as a primary guy, like you can argue that guys like Jae'Sean Tate are more valuable than high usage guys but I wouldn't want him to be rookie of the year over future stars.  With that being said, being a total negative player for half a season should matter a lot IMO (Ant) but it won't I guess because like 6MOY, ROY is a ""ppg"" award"

"Jae'Sean Tate who made the 1st team all-rookie, but he was technically an overseas free agent not a draft pick.  DET had S. Bey make 1st team all-rookie, too.  Rockets also targeted and drafted Kenyon Martin Jr. in the second round who had a stellar ending to the season."

Who can't he guard here? LeBron? If that's the standard to hold people to then noone can defend the 3.   That list is chopped liver. That list is ass^2.   The problem isn't Klay at the 3. It's your other 2 perimeter defenders are too small to guard the 3 and not good enough to defend premiere 1's and 2's. Klay at PG, SG, and SF is a good defensive team. Andre checked the Wing's because he does have more size (fair) but also because Klay was taking their best guard (most often the best player on the opposing team). He didn't get the assignment because the Warriors had another premiere defensive wing so he didn't have to, not because he couldn't."
"Kostas took a draft spot away from a lot of guys way more talented &amp; proven than him solely off his last name.  To think Kendrick Nunn, Duncan Robinson, Yuta Watanabe &amp; Jae'Sean Tate went Undrafted because of this dude.  Shows that scouts do not know as much as fans sometimes."
"Great question. I think with Giannis, the scouts DID do their homework in the sense of, they all went to see him. So first, I'm impressed with the extensive network of scouts. I talked to one of the first guys that ever saw Giannis, and he was so intrigued he wrote in his notebook later that night: there's something special about this guy. So when scouts go on the plane to see someone, they aren't looking for talent. They've already identified the talent. The question then becomes: well, how good is he? I think Giannis had a lot going for him (height). I think what scouts and executives can do in the future is, not overlook those that don't immediately have the height or the body. Look at PJ Tucker. Look at Jae'Sean Tate. One size doesn't fit all, and new molds of players are proving they can succeed in the NBA, even if overlooked by scouts early on in their prep careers."
"I love this question because I think \*so\* many Giannises go undiscovered. One of my favorite parts of reporting the book was talking to other Black Greek players in Greece whom Giannis was friends with growing up, who never got the citizenship fast-tracked the way Giannis did, who never got the chance to make it out. Luck is involved--and of course, having the size Giannis had, certainly helped. I think being super tall of course would have changed everything in the sense of, had NBA scouts known Giannis would grow 2 inches once he go to the NBA, he would have not fallen to 15. Look at some of the best players in the NBA: Curry, Wade, etc even someone like Jae'Sean Tate recently, they all had windy roads. It was not certain they were to be superstars. For every person that has a miraculous rise, there's millions that don't get a shot."
Maybe Jae'sean Tate? Also Malachi Flynn as the other person commented.
"Imagine the Rockets calling the Sixers: ""remember when we said Harden for Simmons, how about Jae'Sean Tate?"
Jae'sean Tate
Where's Jae'sean Tate???
Jae'Sean Tate is nice. Wonder how many people had him making all-rookie first team at the start of the season.
"Detroit rookies were playing great for their draft pick number. Saddiq Bey as the 19th pick had the same amount of triples per game as Luka and Lillard in their rookie years with better percentage and more attempts (crazy when the season was shorter). And Isaiah Stewart as the 16th pick was the rookie who had more rebounds and blocks and it's not even close - Stew had 86 blocks, while Jaden McDaniels had 60 as the second rookie with most blocks; and he had 453 rebounds while the second best rebounder Jae'Sean Tate had 374.  Not knowing these guys doesn't make you a casual, but you're definitely not invested on how the rookies are doing. It's not even your fault because regarding rookies the media only cared about Lamelo and don't give a shit about Detroit."
"&gt;By all accounts Harden requested a trade at the start of the season   Completely fine.  &gt;within a month he showed up out of shape  You’re really just proving my point. Harden was not out of shape because you saw a picture of him with two shirts on looking kinda chubby (which he literally always is). Harden showed up and started playing at an elite level like he does every year and that’s all that matters.  &gt;skipped practice to break covid protocols at a strip club at the height of the pandemic,   Again, proving my point. Harden literally **does not go to training camp even in seasons he doesn’t request a trade**. He just shows up and starts dropping 30 right away, which is exactly what he did last season.   He’s been skipping training camp for *years* because he doesn’t need it. He didn’t skip training camp *because* he requested a trade. It only became a big thing last season because people thought it was something new and the narrative caught on lol  &gt;alienated his teammates (including chucking a ball at Jae'Sean Tate) and started publicly expressing his desire for the trade.  You have literally zero evidence that Harden was the instigator in that situation. It’s entirely possible (and actually pretty likely) that Tate felt slighted from Harden’s trade request. If true, that’s Tate’s own fault for taking it personally as opposed to understanding that a superstar in his prime was making a smart career decision and didn’t have time to wait on young players to develop.  &gt;The crime the Houston F.O. committed was taking more than one month to try and get a better return out the handful of teams Harden agreed to be traded to. His exit was extremely shitty, and put the org in a losing position.  Nah, sorry but you’re just another one of a long line of weirdo Bucks fans who passionately hate Harden for some strange reason."
"By all accounts Harden requested a trade in November - within a month he showed up out of shape, skipped practice to break covid protocols at a strip club at the height of the pandemic, alienated his teammates (including chucking a ball at Jae'Sean Tate) and started publicly expressing his desire for the trade.  The crime the Houston F.O. committed was taking more than one month to try and get a better return out the handful of teams Harden agreed to be traded to.

Rockets:   - Jalen Green - Alperen Sengun - Usman Garuba - Josh Christopher - Kevin Porter JR - Christian Wood - Jae'sean Tate - KJ Martin
"Gotta go with my man Stone... In less than one year, the Rockets went from Harden/Westbrook/Covington led team to a young core of:  Christian Wood Kevin Porter Jr.  Jalen Green  Kenyon Martin Jr. Jae'sean Tate Alperen Sengun Usman Garuba Joshua Christopher  And a crapload of future 1st round picks/swaps."
"Just ignoring the 4 first round picks this year, he got...  1. Wood on a great $14mil/year contract in a sign in trade by giving up 1 first round pick 2. Signed All-Rookie 1st Team member Jae'sean Tate to a cheap 4 year deal from the NBL 3. Bought the 52nd pick last year to draft KJ Martin 4. Traded for KPJ with a Top 55 protected 2nd round pick  That's 4 solid pieces for our rebuild and we hardly gave away anything to get them all. Stone has been so good at finding talent."
"Crazy, but it feels like we've completely forgotten about Jae'sean Tate as well. This team is going to be fun to watch"
"Yeah, I was mostly talking playoffs, where Russ was injured and most definitely dog water. I'm just saying that I wish that Harden ran it back with a healthy Russ because maybe through some butterfly effect bullshit Rockets could realistically have a chance to win a ring.  Literally all of this is speculation but, I think James Harden, Russ, Eric Gordon, Jae'Sean Tate, and Christian Wood are better than the Suns and Bucks. I really loves Russ so I'm tired of seeing missed opportunities keeping us from a ring (CP3, Russ being injured his only playoffs here, Fertitta's existence)."
Homer take: I think Jae'Sean Tate has a legitimate shot of making an all defense team this year. His defense was great for us last and his role on our team is only going to be further cemented this season.
"I don't really see how this is relevant. My point is that at his prime he was good enough to be a starter in weaker team if given the minutes and a slot to do so. Obviously that's not what happened, but given that he's performed similarly or better to some of the weaker NBA starters when playing against or even with them I don't really see  how it's that he ""absolutely"" wouldn't have been good enough rather than that situations/fit didn't align in time.  Even if we are discussing whether or not he could have been starter at the time he played in the league, we'd have the issue that he never really went to a weak team.   I mean how much better do you think players like Delon Wright, Josh Jackson, Jae'Sean Tate, Dwayne Bacon, or Cole Anthony for example are than what Nando DeColo is now or at his best?  Or you can take those guys I mentioned, do you think they would have started in Spurs or Toronto at that time? Hell, I'm not even sure if someone like Rubio or Bledsoe would have."
"And we lost another Sydney Kings player to the NBA, first Jae'Sean Tate, now Didi Louzada :("
The fusion dance between Jalen Green and Jae'Sean Tate
"Houston have to be the big winners so far. Next thing is to find moves for Gordon, House and somehow Wall, and then build around:   **PG:** Kevin Porter Jr, Josh Christopher.   **SG:** Jalen Green.  **SF:** Jae'Sean Tate.  **PF:** Christian Wood, KJ Martin.  **C:** Alperen Sengun, Usman Garuba."
Kevin Porter Jr   Jalen Green   Jae'Sean Tate   Christian Wood   Alperen Sengun  &amp;#x200B;  Damn...
"Assuming we take Green, our team is gonna be super entertaining this season. KPJ, Jalen Green, Jae'Sean Tate, Christian Wood, Kenyon Martin Jr, plus guys like Armoni Brooks and Khyri Thomas. That team might not make the playoffs, but they'll certainly play some entertaining basketball."
He's a top 1 player of all time man stop the 🧢. Jae'Sean Tate and KJ Martin are unlucky that he is a bball player cuz he stole the title from both of them :(

"probably picking the most obvious team here, but:  KPJ  Jalen Green  Jae'Sean Tate  Christian Wood  Alperen Sengun  Off the Bench: Eric Gordon, KMJ, Nwaba, Theis, Josh Christopher, Gerald Green  Bold of me to only use one superstar: Gerald Green"
"If they take that route, look for them to move Christian Wood and Jae'Sean Tate.  The next contracts they will command is going to tie up a lot of space, so the Rockets will want to use all the cap space they can prior to that happening. Plus, they will obviously bring back assets, too (if a prolonged rebuild is the goal).  Otoh, if they keep him around, 2023 represents their one great shot to make a big splash in FA to ""top things off"" like Atlanta did last summer, so taking a bad contract just doesn't work. Additionally, keeping him (and Tate) at age 27-28 would signal they feel they are closer to ""go-time"", since they will be entering their prime and the guards will hopefully be looking nice by year 3&amp;5."
Jalen Green  Christian Wood  Kevin Porter Jr.  Jae'Sean Tate  Alperen Sengun
"&gt;Yawn. It’s 2021, can’t use anything but TS% anymore  According to [basketball reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_advanced.html#advanced_stats::ts_pct) there were only 6 qualified players in the NBA last year with a worse TS% than Wall.  &gt;I mean, if you wanna talk about why his assists were down last year, maybe start with the trash teammates he had who couldn’t hit shots.  Here's a list of players on the rockets last year who played significant minutes (500+) and had a better TS% than John Wall: Kelly Olynyk, Sterling Brown, Christian Wood, Kenyon Martin Jr., Eric Gordon, Jae'Sean Tate, Armoni Brooks, David Nwaba, KPJ, Danuel House, Boogie Cousins, and Victor Oladipo. The only two who were less efficient than him in that many minutes were noted offensive sparkplugs PJ Tucker and Ben McLemore. Talk all you want about how his assist numbers would be better if he didn't have ""trash teammates who couldn't hit shots"", but I find that really hard to take when almost everyone on the team is out shooting him.  Would his efficiency be better if he didn't have to carry so much offensive load on a shitty team? Yeah, probably. Would it be *significantly* better? I don't see why it would be. John walls main role on a team will always been as an offensive engine. He's not a dynamic off ball player, especially not at this point in his career.  If he were to get 6th man minutes on a good team, he could probably put up more efficient numbers on 50-60% of his current volume, but the fact of the matter is that no contending team is going to give 6th man minutes to a relatively inefficient scorer who can't defend effectively anymore, even if he was on a much cheaper deal."

It's a copypasta based on a reported Harden - Jae'Sean Tate confrontation last year.
"yeah it's more like he was smart and reacted fast enough that he could challenge guards from behind on blow bys. he was never Garnett in the foot speed department even before the first knee injury. he could definitely guard some 3s really well if he had to though, because they were bigger and slower then. nowadays, 6'4"" Jae'Sean Tate is a 3/4 lmao"
"It's about Jae'Sean Tate, not Oden"
This is referring to Jae'Sean Tate
"There's a 3rd part of this equation, our starting SF Jae'Sean Tate shoots 29% from 3 for his career."

West Steph Curry Jalen Green Jae'Sean Tate Christian Wood Alpen Sengun  dont care about the east.  Would have had KPJ as the PG but he's been battling injuries and steph has been slightly better.

"I would say Jae'Sean Tate or Kenyon Martin Jr are the most underrated, both are great defensively and can score if needed, KMJ is like 6'6 but he plays like he's 6'10"
"Jae'Sean Tate had 20 points, 5 rebounds, 1 steal and 2 blocks against the Lakers tonight. Some people in the game thread were talking shit forgetting he was All Rookie First Team last year."
really how can the lakers hope to hang with the star studded roster of houston featuring mega stars like alperen sengun and jae'sean tate
"Jae'Sean ""drove Harden out of Houston"" Tate"
