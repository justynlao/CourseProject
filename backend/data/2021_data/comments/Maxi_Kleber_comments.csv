You should wait until you have been able to take the time to watch each team play a few times before making this big of a list for the season. Having James Johnson above Maxi Kleber and Willie Cauley-Stein above Trey Burke is unfathomable as a Mavs fan.
Maxi Kleber just looks like a good dude.
That's exactly it. Dallas could have had postponements instead of Ls if Trey Burke and Boban had made out with Maxi Kleber.
"KP (#2 offensive weapon) was out with the meniscus recovery, Josh Richardson (3a offensive weapon) was out with covid, (Dwight Powell (the only backup center with any pick and roll ability) was out with covid, Dorian Finney Smith (2nd best defender who shot 37% on 3s last year) was out with Covid, and Maxi Kleber (best defender/shooter who is shooting over 47% on 3s this year at the Power Forward position) is out with Covid - all these players have been out at least 9 games. Jalen Brunson (backup point guard and is shooting almost 50/40/90 on 12ppg) was also out with covid protocol for like 5 games."
"Maxi Kleber.  Hell, with how things have gone, he might arguably be our MVP.  (Not really)."
What they need is a big men inside to set good screens and catch lobs and get rebounds. They are getting killed on the rebounds and their best big men is Maxi Kleber. KP is more of a stretch 4
"Big difference between missing Seth Curry for 8 games, Furkan Korkmaz and Mike Scott vs missing Kristaps Porziņģis, Josh Richardson, Jalen Brunson, Dorian Finney Smith, Maxi Kleber and Dwight Powell, and then have Tim Hardaway Jr play through injury."
"2nd-6th best players (Porziņģis, Josh Richardson, Maxi Kleber, Dorian Finney Smith, Jalen Brunson &amp; Dwight Powell) have all missed nearly half the season. We've also had the 5th hardest SRS schedule thus far. As of now the remaining schedule is the 29th hardest."
whatever you all do: lets give Maxi Kleber some all star love. the man was hit hard from covid while traveling to entertain us NBA fans.
"maxi kleber normally, who is out rn. That's why our center rotation is atrocious. I don't know what your point is, I said rotation, that involves more than 1 player"
Maxi Kleber keeps flying under the radar
"Luka had a slow start and when he started getting going, we lost what I think are four of our essential players in Maxi Kleber, JRich, Dorian Finney Smith, and Dwight Powell for 2 weeks and counting now due to health protocols. The first three are starters and provide excellent 3pt shooting and defensive versatility. Without them, our defense has suffered heavily and with no reliable 3pt shooting for Luka to pass to, teams can effectively swarm him on drives since Wes Iwundu isn’t gonna be swishing anything. Powell can catch lobs, which is something that our replacement WCS can’t do, and Boban, as much as we love him, is an absolute non factor and is a negative on defense.  Our schedule as also been absolutely brutal along with missing a lot of our guys. Obviously there are some games we should’ve won that we lost, but the reason for this rough stretch has been due to us losing our starters."
Give Maxi Kleber Jalen Brunson’s handles/playmaking.
"Those are pretty tough ones, but I’ll try: Kostas Antetokounmpo, Nick Claxton, Kent Bazemore, Ivica Zubac, Bryn Forbes, Maxi Kleber, Matisse Thybulle, Nickel Alexander-Walker, Caleb Martin, aaaaaaand Damian Lillard?"
"Maxi Kleber, Dorian Finney-Smith and Josh Richardson are all still out for Covid protocols and have been for over a week now. They’re also our 3 best defenders."
Maxi kleber.
"Maxi Kleber, Draymond Green, PJ Tucker, Robert Covington, Joe Harris and Duncan Robinson come to mind"
"Josh Richardson, Dorian Finney Smith, Maxi Kleber and then Powell is still out"
"These aren't little boys who need daddy to teach them before they try to learn anything new.  Guys get better because they will themselves to get better. They identify weakness, opportunity, whatever, and they create a path to get better.    Rick ain't teaching Luka how to add a step back 3 into his game, or more relatable as a role player, Maxi Kleber has gotten better every off-season and seemingly added a new skill/refined his fundamentals. You can hire coaches during the offseason, you can workout with other NBA guys, blah blah blah.     If a role player isn't getting better over seasons, it ain't at all on the NBA head coach; it's the guy."
Maxi Kleber turns into Steph Curry the moment he steps onto the court to play the Bucks. I knew we’d win the moment I saw Kleber was out for that last game.
"We were missing THJ, Josh Richardson, Maxi Kleber, Dwight Powell, Dorian Finney Smith, Jalen Brunson and Kristaps Porziņģis is in his 3rd game back. That's 50+ FGA we were missing. Someone had to make up for them being gone. I'd rather have Luka shoot 30 FGA than Wes Iwundu or Tyrell Terry taking 15 FGA apiece."
+ Maxi Kleber
Tim Hardaway Jr. and Maxi Kleber sucks to not have them
Maxi kleber? One of the top defenders and a good 3 point shooter.
Maxi Kleber is solid for Dallas. WCS and Powell have their moments too. Not an amazing group but not bad imo.
Need Josh Richardson and Maxi Kleber for sure
Yes Maxi Kleber the next Dirk
Maxi Kleber
Luka also routinely pulled down eight to nine boards a game when he played alongside Maxi Kleber and Porzingis last season. He's just that good a rebounder.
Maxi Kleber is also out and he's been starting a lot recently
"We don't have Josh Richardson, Dorian Finney Smith, Jalen Bruson and Maxi Kleber. We are missing 3 starters + our backup guard. Even with KP back we are still missing a lot."
James Johnson plays the 5 when he was on the court with Maxi Kleber
Maxi Kleber has no friends confirmed
"We are missing 3 starters + our back up guard right now. Josh Richardson, Dorian Finney Smith, Maxi Kleber and Brunson. If this keeps up, we will have Luka + rookies. Josh, DFS and Maxi are literally our 3 best defenders as well. We are so fucked."
Every time I see this guy's name I'm reminded of that NBA top ten guy's voiceover last year.  Something about Maxi Kleber will make you a believer.  That was one bomb ass highlight reel
"do borderline allstars count?   dragic, murray, smart  edit: nvm i dont think dragic counts. he's a former all star.   dejounte murray, maxi kleber, dennis schroeder, shai, c. wood, sexton, bojan  not all of these players are on the same level. i know."
"Three years ago he wasn't even a real NBA player. Rick gets a lot of shit for not giving rookies minutes, but look how he turned Maxi Kleber and Dorian-Finney Smith into very good NBA 3&amp;D players. It's unreal how much they both have improved under Rick."
Maxi Kleber gets all the 50/50 balls. Incredible hustle
Maxi Kleber is one of their best players and German so seems like a perfect fit?
"OT Luka is the same beast but a different animal. Also, fucking Maxi Kleber."
"Malone needs to work his rotations. Understood that MPJ is out tonight, but we got -15 Gary Harris playing on Maxi Kleber late in the 4th into OT."
Shoutout to Maxi fucking Kleber
MAXI KLEBER IS A DAWG
"Maxi ""I'm Not Luka"" Kleber!"
MAXI KLEBER
Maxi Kleber. That is all.
Maxi Kleber
Maxi Kleber coming out party
Maxi Kleber was huge in the 4th Quarter/OT
maxi kleber is honest to god clutch
Maxi Fucking Kleber
Maxi Kleber: Hold my Sauerbraten
MAXI FUCKING KLEBER.   NOW JUST FUCKING DEFEND
There was a graphic earlier about International NBA players but there was an error. It listed Maxi Kleber as an NBA Play.
Maxi Kleber is incentivized to make this happen.   /s
"Top 6 for the Mavs is very easy.  1. Luka  2. Porzingis 3. J-Rich 4. Tim Hardaway Jr. 5. Maxi Kleber 6. Dorian Finney-Smith  7 is difficult, because it really comes down to how you build out the rest of the roster. It's Jalen Brunson, Trey Burke, Willie Cauley-Stein, James Johnson, Boban, or Dwight Powell."
Maxi kleber is awful
Maxi Kleber  No bias
He's coming off an achilles rupture just eleven months removed from the injury. We're trying to rebuild him into the player he was until KP returns.  Maxi Kleber is better at the five but he works better on the 2nd unit than Powell.
The players who did not score were Maxi Kleber and Nicolo Melli.
"Without looking at Google or the comments, can you name which player came from where?  #Wizards  * Rui Hachimura * Deni Avdija * Davis Bertans  * Robin Lopez * Raul Neto * Issac Bonga * Alex Len  #Mavs  * Luka Doncic * Tingus Pingus * Boban * Maxi Kleber * Willie Cauley-Stien * Dwight Powell * Nicolo Melli * Josh Green"
"Maxi Kleber and he is truly underrated, because only Knicks and Mavericks fans know why."
Luka  KP  Tim Hardaway JR  Jalen Brunson  Maxi Kleber  Josh Richardson  Dorian Finney Smith  Willey Cauley Stein  Trey Burke
Second is Maxi Kleber?
He did at the beginning of the year but they decided to go bigger with Maxi Kleber at PF Richardson at SG and Finney Smith at SF. I think before Hardaway was starting and Maxi was coming off the bench.
Tim Hardaway Jr and Maxi Kleber
Dude you’re a warriors fan? You should know WCS is complete ass. Maxi Kleber isn’t stopping AD lol
"This off-season the timberwolves should offer the Mavs Malik Beasley for Maxi Kleber and something - Dorian Finney-Smith and a 1st, Jalen Brunson and a highly protected 1st, etc. Mavs get a scoring guard, which they need, and the wolves get a defensive PF, which they desperately need."
"Luka, Klay Thompson, Maxi Kleber, Joker, Bobi They win it all!"
This. Maxi kleber is shooting like 45% on 4.2 attempts but hes not an elite shooter. Might be an elite shooter with spot up wide open shots but to call someone an elite shooter without other caveats i feel like you need a decent ability to create your own shots or at least be making them at a decent rate when contested.
"Maxi Kleber is a solid example. Good Defender, 45% from 3 on 4.2 attempts per game and undrafted from Europe"
I was told Maxi Kleber was the Zion stopper though
"Pelicans deserves to win. Zion was unstoppable.   Holy shit though, the moving screen call by Scott Foster in Maxi Kleber with two minutes left. Absolute horseshit. Very next play Adams had a far more egregious one that was uncalled."
You think a dude like Maxi Kleber is getting triple teamed in that situation?
"He would be such a good fit in the Dallas starting lineup and a perfect complement for KP.  Could play the interior/cutter as KP stretches the floor, along with a lob threat for Luka off of the numerous PnRs he runs. Also adds a more robust inside-out playmaker that we sometimes lack with KP.  Would give us an upgrade at the 4 to guard the bigger forwards/wings that have a tendency to kill us and allows KP to work as a weak side shot blocker which is his big strength on D, plus adds additional rebounding in the front court    Love me some Maxi Kleber, who is absolutely a solid player, and having him as the first wing off the bench would be a serious threat."
Serious question. Can he play 4 for long period? Or can he be permanent 4 (and situational 5) like maxi kleber?
Maxi Kleber is among the best
Maxi Kleber
I mean you don't really know their attempts or shot selection.  That's like saying Maxi Kleber is a better shooter than Steph Curry because of percentage.
"Everyone talking about Portis, give some love to Maxi Kleber. Portis changed teams which could explain some improvement in 3 pt %, Maxi just worked and improved. Also, almost all the games Maxi missed was due to having COVID which apparently he had worse that his teammates. So keeping up % after return is nice also."
I’m trying to enjoy this game but I can’t get over that Nuggets announcer saying Maxi Kleber is a better 3 point shooter than Dirk. Astonishing someone would say that out loud on national tv.
"Mavs are 16-9 with Maxi Kleber, but 3-8 without him. Why is Maxi Kleber not mentioned in the MVP conversation?  I'll admit, his numbers are ""nothing special,"" but his advanced stats are career highs and he's playing great defense.  If that’s not most VALUABLE player-caliber then I don’t know what is."
The best contract in the league is Dorian Finney Smith or Maxi Kleber LOL. Kuz is playing up to his contract tho.
"Mate, Pokusevski is damn long that he made me think it was a guard closing out on him (its actually 6'10 Maxi Kleber)  With his height + release point he isn't gonna be that affected at getting his shot off, save for some of the tallest &amp; longest athletes in the league like Giannis."
Maxi Kleber will star as Luka Doncic in his biography.
maxi kleber best
No did you see his username? Clearly Maxi Kleber and wants a trade to the *better* Texas team
"So, I would like him obviously, but based on my limited experience watching him and looking at BBREF, he looks like a maxi Kleber with worse defense, and maxi’s shooting has stepped up this year. And we need big defenders who can rebound. We’re not getting anywhere in the west if we can’t stop Jokic and Davis from getting 40 points"
"Kristaps Porzingis   OG Anunoby   Khris Middleton   Kyle Lowry  Mike Conley   Bench:   Joe Ingles, Thad Young, Rudy Gay, Danillo Gallinari, Maxi Kleber, Chris Boucher, Derrick Rose   Would this team win 60 games? Idk but it would win alot"
"Pretty much any of the Spurs guards, a few of the Dallas players like Jalen Brunson, Tim Hardaway Jr, Maxi Kleber and Dwight Powell  They seem great and they’ve impressed when I’ve seen them but no idea how consistent they are or how the factor into the teams plans and futures or how good they are really"
"Maxi Kleber is stupid hot. Kelly Oubre and Ricky Rubio are really pretty. Kyle Lowry has that butt. Blake Griffin, I can't unassociate from his scene in Broad City."
&gt; Poor Mans ~~Maxi Kleber~~ Uwe Blab
Poor Mans Maxi Kleber
"Kleber is a sharp shooter with great efficiency, can switch on wings and can block very well.  No way Dallas want Drummond over Maxi.   At this point Drummond is even worse than WCS, at least WCS doesn’t try to dribble and post up."
"Maxi Kleber, Dorian Finney-Smith, Tim Hardaway Jr, Jalen Brunson, KP are not trash lol"
"I agree, a better search might be something like DBPM &gt; 0, 3PAr &gt; .5 so you can see people who have a positive impact on defense and take the majority of their shots from 3  I can't see the full results on Stathead, but of the 20 players the 10 who show up are Maxi Kleber, Josh Hart, Donte DiVincenzo, Lonzo Ball, Jae Crowder, Robert Covington, OG Anunoby, Pat Connaughton, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Kevin Huerter so it checks out with OP's list"
Maxi kleber is an excellent defender and a very good 3 point shooter. Fuckin love that guy
i remember seeing Maxi Kleber playing piano in the video where Boban was singing for his wife
“Maxi pad” for Maxi Kleber (not a nave fan but I think it’s pretty weird). As a magic fan maybe “The Fournicator” for Evan Fournier.
Yeah but you see that he is so dominant that he can coexist with a non shooter like Adams. So ideally you'd rather want a strong presence under the rim and maybe have a Maxi Kleber type of player off the bench for certain matchups.
Not Luka-Maxi Kleber

"KP is good, but he 90% of the time pops on a pnr instead of roll. He’s like a 7’3” Maxi Kleber.  It was good the mavs got him even at the max but he is overpriced for what he brings to the table"
"Maxi Kleber outscored Lebron tonight, i think we know who the real goat is"
Idk what it is but I like Maxi Kleber. Maybe it’s the smooth shooting
I guess Maxi Kleber wasn't important enough to make the list.
"Generally, it’s less relative to size/position, and more about the other team’s talents. The Mavs plug Dorian Finney-Smith and Maxi Kleber to cover the other team’s two biggest threats, and Luka will usually cover whichever 2-4 isn’t as big of a problem. Since Luka’s defense has improved this year, I think this is mostly so that he can save more energy for offense.   That being said, he has taken tougher assignments this year (usually not PGs, to answer your question). He did a great job covering Lebron earlier this year."
"- We look tired, Luka is clearly playing through a knee injury and Maxi Kleber has taken a hit from COVID and leg injuries. It also doesn’t help that we play a short rotation of Luka/Richardson/Finney-Smith/Kleber/KP with Brunson, Tim Hardaway Jr as the only players getting significant bench minutes. Powell lately has been getting minutes, but Cauley-Stein is has just come back from protocols, so he probably takes up a few minutes. Melli the first few games with us was a nice stand-in for Maxi in the rotation, however his minutes have decreased  - Our defense hasn’t looked good last few games, yesterday we gave up 45 in the 2nd quarter vs the Kings without putting up much effort on that end.   - Richardson certainly isn’t what we have hoped for, the only consistent shot creator outside of Luka is Brunson, who mainly creates for himself. We need to pick up a secondary ball-handler, so that we can prevent the heliocentric offense that we are running now, which is tiring on Luka.  - We have a tight schedule, which I don’t want to blame, as we are losing against teams we should win against, like the Rockets and Kings. On the other hand, we put up great wins against Milwaukee and Utah. Other teams deal with tight schedules as well. Also, we had about a week break due to the snowstorm in Texas, which gave us some time to reset (with instant positive effect, however not in the long run).   We have to reset this week, big back to back games against the Lakers are coming up with the first game against the Lakers on the second night of a b2b after a game against the Pistons. If we go 3-0 in this stretch (which I honestly doubt, even with AD and LeBron being out), we have regained a good chance of getting the 6th seed. If we don’t get the 6th seed, it has to be mostly put on ourselves and not on outside factors."
Gotta hammer the Maxi Kleber over then.

If ya defense is Maxi Kleber and Dwight Powell yeah well. That says enough.

"Must be a surreal feeling for Dirk, knowing he grew up in the same town as German legend Maxi Kleber"
Maxi Kleber and Dorian Finney-Smith. No surprise Mavs were shit while both were out with Covid and recovering from it. They do a lot of heavy lifting.
Maxi Kleber
"Jesus Kleber is on 9M I should’ve went with him lol. 40M for KP, DnP, and Maxi. That’s some atrocious ass recruiting"
Jared Greenberg is a spitting image of Maxi Kleber
Somewhere Maxi Kleber is chuckling to himself
Maxi Kleber for like half a second
"That's my favorite part about him. Even when he murdered Maxi Kleber, dude was half way down the court while his teammates were still screaming at the dude lmao."
Maxi Kleber:  HE CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS!!!
Maxi Kleber is somewhere doing the Leo pointing at the tv meme
"That’s another factor in analytics, at least the ones us normal schlubs can find on BBallReference: they play into the law of averages. That’s a smart thing to do from a team-building perspective, because it shows a player is ultimately a net value in the long run. But for guys like Wright, Jae Crowder, Georges Niang, and Maxi Kleber, you need a coach who can pull the plug or adjust when they’re performing below the average, because they can shoot you out of the game when they play poorly. In the current West where two or three wins can help you miss or make the playoffs (especially now, with the play-in), you can’t set rigid lineups because the numbers say so. Almost no analytics adherent is doing that, but this article makes it seems like the Mavs guy was, considering how the players argued Carlisle’s rotations were too rigid."
We’ll give you Ben Simmons and Paul Reed for him. Gotta give us Maxi Kleber too though.
"That guy and maxi kleber for the mavs, also pg13 when he's off are players who lose you games"
On paper that team seems solid at least. It is surprising how bad they really were. Carlisle is a wierd coach. So many established players just struggle under him but he seems to be able to bring out good things in random guys like Maxi Kleber.
"On the Mavs, Jalen Brunson and Maxi Kleber.    They seem really nice, intelligent and funny.   Good role players too."
We know its not maxi kleber
"* Zach Lavine $19m a year. * Lu Dort $1.4m a year. * Brogdon $20m a year. * Myles Turner $17m a year. * Sabonis $19m a year. * Capela $18m a year. * DRose $7m a year. * Nerlens Noel $5m a year. * Monte Morris $9m a year. * Royce O’Neal $8.5m a year. * Maxi Kleber $8m a year. * Dorian Finney-Smith $4m a year. * Serge Ibaka $9m a year.  Bogdan is a better player than some of these guys, but that doesn’t mean his contract is a better value."
"It *sort of* changed my opinion, sort of did not. Like credit to him he played great in those two games and really throughout that series mostly.   But I also am very aware that... who's the Mavs best defender / who did they try to guard him with? Maxi Kleber and DFS? Neither is great... So I reserve judgment. The Mavs defense didnt really have a good answer to at least make things difficult on him which the Nuggets did last year with Jerami Grant, and this year will again with Aaron Gordon (should they match up). Both guys are better defenders individually than any Mavs player they threw at him, really. Mikal Bridges is also better, as is Jae Crowder probably, should the Suns and Clippers meet in a WCF.   We shall see is all I'm saying. I still dont overall buy their offense without an elite playmaker. Still think there's too much isolation (though it's better than last year in that respect)."

"Use your head bro, he's obviously talking about Maxi Kleber."
"The Nets are like the Mavs, if KP was replaced with Kyrie and THJ was replaced by Harden. Maxi Kleber with Joe Harris. And then literally every other player was upgraded  Clippers can't beat them"
"What about Maxi Kleber, the last Triple Dirk?"
Mavs are gonna have to package his bloated contract with 3 1st rounders and maybe Dorian Finney Smith or Maxi kleber
"Evan Fournier, Jabari Parker, Tristan Thompson, Marcus Smart and Semi Ojeleye are the only celtics that have been in the league for more than 2 years. The rest are late 1st and 2nd round picks from the last 2 years. That is the Celtics team without Tatum in the playoffs this year. That team wins 20 games in a season in the East. It is probably a worse version of that Cavs team in 2018-2019 that won 19 games.  Kristaps Porzingas, Tim Hardaway Jr, Dorian Finney-Smith, Boban Marjanović, Josh Richardson, Maxi Kleber, hell, the entire Mavs roster is NBA veterans. A lot of them + veterans. They'd probably win 35 games in the East.   Luka is a fantastic player, but his supporting cast was clearly better than Tatum's this year's playoffs. It's just a fact."
"that's certainly not KP's decision, and the thing he's frustrated about his being planted 30 feet from the hoop and having none of the offense run through him. he's not a ball handler, you have to run some actions to get him involved in situations that he can take advantage of. That doesn't just mean posting him up. Run him in some DHOs, stagger screens, spain pick and rolls as a lob threat, let him face up at the elbow and run some screening and cutting action around him. KP looked like shit this series, but he wasn't given a role where he could do anything but be a second Maxi Kleber. And if that's the role you give him why would you expect different results?"
"Kleber is in the league because of elite defense and the ability to shoot a bit, not because Luka creates for him. Luka makes him better. But there is a limit. Maxi would be valuable in any team as a rotation player."
seriously... Luka somehow helping DFS and Maxi Kleber turn into 40% 3pt shooters is nuts   how is this even a question
"&gt; The Hawks have six players they drafted on rookie scale contracts **while the Mavs only have three**.  Dorian Finney-Smith  Dwight Powell  Jalen Brunson  Maxi Kleber  Tyrell Terry  Josh Green  Luka Doncic  lol that's half of their roster. And that's not even considering they traded for 3 more players bird rights (Richardson, Porzingis &amp; Hardaway JR)."
"That's true, but it's partially because the Mavs didn't attempt to use him any differently than Dorian Finney Smith. What do people expect him to do if the gameplan just parks him on the perimeter? He's never going to be as good as his contract, but if the Mavs keep him, they've gotta try to get him more involved - to take the burden off Luka and to make the offense less predictable. Get him involved in more screening actions, get him running some DHOs, get him more face-ups at the elbow where he can use his height even more. Take a page out of the T-Wolves playbook for Kevin Love. I get he hasn't been good, but if you play him like he's a second Maxi Kleber, why would you expect different results?"
"To an extent, sure. But the Mavs have decided to play him like he's a second Maxi Kleber. What do you expect? Luka is basically out there playing Harden-ball, which is fine, it works when you have a star who's an elite facilitator and shot maker. But it turns everyone else into statues who just spot up on the perimeter. I'm seeing so many people complain that Porzingis is just playing like a 7-foot shooting guard (including Kevin O'Connor) but how else do you expect him to play in this offense? Not saying post him up, but you gotta run some actions to get him involved - high-low game with Boban, DHOs, screens to get him a little space to shoot at the elbow, where his height is even more of an advantage. It takes more creativity to get big guys involved than it does to just turn the ball over to a dominant guard and say, do your thing. T-Wolves were great at this with Kevin Love. If the Mavs don't want to run any actions for him, there's no reason for Porzingis to be on the team."
"yep, my thought as well. Luka is basically out there playing Harden-ball, which is fine, it works when you have a star who's an elite facilitator and shot maker. But it turns everyone else into statues who just spot up on the perimeter. I'm seeing so many people complain that Porzingis is just playing like a 7-foot shooting guard (including Kevin O'Connor) but how else do you expect him to play in this offense? All they're having him do is spot up like he's a second Maxi Kleber. What do you expect? I'm not saying post him up, he's clearly bad at that, but you have to run actions that get him involved, and I think you named some good ones. Have him play more high-low with Boban, get him moving to try to contort the defense, get him shooting a little closer in where his height is even more of an advantage. I don't think he's ever going to live up to his contract, but he can clearly be better than this, if he's not being used in a PJ Tuker role.   This is also something Luka has to get better at. He's clearly realizing his immense powers as an offensive star - but he needs to understand when to defer, how to get his teammates involved and how to manage his stamina so he's relevant into the 4th quarter. I get that's tough, because a Luka shot/pass is the best offense basically every time. But he can't do that every time, for 44 minutes. This team needs to find more court balance, think that should be a priority for next season."
He’s 6’4. Kawhi was getting what he wanted against DFS who is 6’7 and Maxi Kleber who is 6’10. O Neal might be quicker laterally but Kawhi still has a height advantage.
Getting defended by Jimmy Butler and Ben Simmons with Joel Embiid at the rim versus Maxi Kleber and Dorian Finney Smith with no reliable rim protector.
Maxi Kleber is even more worthless.
What’s even more astounding is Maxi Kleber and Porzingis’ stat lines the last 3 games.
He's carrying a roster full of scrubs... well Maxi Kleber is nice
"Oh boy, I can't wait for 23059 takes over the next two days saying that a team that needed 7 games to beat Maxi Kleber, Boban, and KP at the 5 will schematically destroy Rudy Gobert."
Maxi “Kyle Lowry” Kleber
Maxi Kleber is an NPC in Doncic's life.
Not the best but maxi kleber was good for most of the year
"&gt; he’s playing far far superior defense      I would not say it's ""far"" superior.        Here are the defensive numbers for Jokic against players he guarded for more than 5 minutes.    Kanter - 40% (2-5)     Lillard - 46% (12-26)      Nurkic - 41% (12-29)       Average - 43% (26-60)       For Kawhi...     Tim Hardaway Jr - 52.9% (9-17)      Maxi Kleber - 75% (3-4)     Luka Doncic - 38% (9-24)       Kristaps Porzingis - 46% (5-11)      Dorian Finney Smith - 17% (1-6)       Average - 38% (27-72)  For Luka...      Reggie Jackson - 67% (6-9)      Rajon Rondo - 17% (1-6)     Paul George - 29% (2-7)    Nicholas Batum - 38% (3-8)     Marcus Morris Sr - 33% (3-9)     Kawhi Leonard - 50% (7-14)       Average - 42% (22-53)       They are all terrific. Yes, Kawhi has been better on that end. But it's not ""far far"" superior.      &gt; while getting far more attention from the defense than harden/Durant      If we're using this argument, then what about Luka? His three main defenders have been Kawhi (18m), PG (13m), and Batum (13m).     Kawhi's main defender? Maxi Kleber (29m) followed by Dorian Finney-Smith (20m). There's no question Luka has been facing far better defenders.      &gt; against the the pacers in the first round.      You mean the 48-win Pacers? I think there's a difference between a team that's 2 wins from 50 versus a team that's 2 wins from 40."
This guy thinks Maxi Kleber is another white dude who hasn't played in the NBA in 10 years and is calling people dumbass hahahah
"Close outs are awful, I agree. He tends to hop from side to side with a wide stance when defending on the perimeter (assuming he's not already beat) so I still think he does a serviceable job on that end. Not sure it says anything about him getting beat by Kawhi when Kawhi is a top 5 iso player on the league and to be honest he had played better defense on Kawhi compared to the ones assigned to him (Dorian Finney Smith and Maxi Kleber)"
Maxi Kleber seems like such a nice guy. That sucks.
&gt;Rick Carlisle messed up big down the line. That timeout that killed their own momentum and inserting Maxi Kleber into the closing lineup who is in a slump.  Boban was dominating and the zone was successful and then Carlisle completely forgot about both in the 4th.

My bad. I forgot about their remarkable playoff success in the last few years. No doubt due to the good rotation player skills of Maxi Kleber.
"Out of bounds call on Maxi Kleber, Porziņģis getting hit on his layup, possible backcourt violation..."
Relative to what? Maxi Kleber?
Maxi Kleber was -11 0-4 from the field and played twenty minutes. Including being on the floor during the final five minutes of a tight fourth quarter. While the Boban+KP lineup was like +15 when they were on the floor together.   What the fuck was Carlisle doing leaving Kleber out there in absolute crucial minutes? Insane
I blame Maxi Kleber
"Yes, one series. Thankfully he doesn't have anything else in his past where he gives lackluster effort and seems to quit on his team. And that has never followed him leaving town and looking for a better (and easier) chance of getting to the Finals every year. No, that has never happened. /s  Enjoy the greatness, because he's a great player. But take the criticism of him being maybe the most narcissistic NBA player of all time. Takes all the credit at all times (when I beat the Warriors), let's his teammates take all the blame. The amount of role players James has thrown under the bus is like three teams deep now. I thought he makes everyone better? Meanwhile Knicks trade cast offs and Maxi Kleber look like actual NBA players in Dallas."
His brother did the same thing yesterday after elbowing Maxi Kleber in the face/neck and getting a Flagrant 1
"I'd much rather watch Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, and some of the douchebag Clippers personalities face the Jazz than Luka Doncic and... Tim Hardaway Jr.? Kristaps ""$150 million traffic cone"" Porzingis? Maxi Kleber?"
NBA players: We’re only human. Please treat us as such!  *Maxi Kleber farts near Kawhi and then Kawhi dies*
"Maxi Kleber picked up Kawhi, Luka and Dorian made the same decision to collapse if anyone should have rotated after that point it was Tim in the corner."
And Kawhi is scoring on undrafted players Dorian Finney Smith and Maxi Kleber lmao you score on those that are in front of you.
"And how many of them are those? Luka and jokic? Why would they leave their respective teams? Lol they can go build a team with the Bogdonovichs, Rubio, and maxi Kleber and see how that works while red Auerbach rolls in his grave"
That KP is trash and Maxi Kleber is a pussy
The Maxi Kleber FMVP arc
"Mini Kleber doesn't cut it, you need Maxi"
"That’s Maxi Kleber, so hot right now"
"I understand how you expect Paul George and kawhi to not perform to this level, but I think it’s extremely reasonable to expect that superstars are more likely to play this well and sustain as opposed to role players. Mavericks role players are shooting the three absolutely phenomenally. Brunson is shooting 58% from three. Maxi Kleber is shooting 63% from three. THJ is shooting 65% from three. You’re a reasonable person and I know you’re not going to argue that this is normal. I think we have to consider that it is much more likely that Paul George and kawhi can keep up performances like these as opposed to Mavericks role players all shooting 60%+ from three on high volume."
"Don't get why you're being downvoted, you're right. Finney-Smith and Porzingus both went 3-10. Maxi Kleber is 6'10"", played 35 minutes, and only got 1 rebound."
He ain’t never been defended by Maxi Kleber!
You mean Maxi Kleber left on an island to guard a Kawhi iso isn't going to work?
"I mean, he was guarded by Maxi Kleber and someone pretending to be Kristaps Porzingus. Of course he’s going to shoot &gt;80%"
"**NAW** some of yall need to give this post some awards, yall been talking shit on this dudes name.  This dude is a FUCKING BEAST &amp; a guy named Maxi Kleber ain't stopping shit"
Mavericks cannot be serious with this maxi Kleber on Kawhi shit
Maxi Kleber is a real glue guy.
"Maxi *""Steph Curry but white, from Germany and plays the 4""* Kleber"
"Thing is, Maxi Kleber does the same thing even if he’s undersized"
So Maxi Kleber should get more hype than Zion then as well
"I got the feeling that a lot of players on the Mavs have turned a corner but their record didn’t show it because of covid and injuries.          Players like Tim Hardaway, Brunson, Finny Smith and Maxi Kleber have all got a lot better this year. Obviously so has Luka."
"I'd happily take a contested stepback 3 over leaving Pat Bev, Reggie Jackson, Morris, etc. on an island lmao. The idea that it's just completely impossible to get over the bone crushing screens by such monstrous brickhouses like Kristaps Porzingis and Maxi Kleber is also funny; they ain't Steven Adams or Zach Randolph bruh."
Good man Maxi Kleber 💪

**PG:** Luka Doncic   **SG:** Maxi Kleber   **SF:** Lauri Markkanen  **PF:** Kristaps Porzingis   **C:** Boban Marjanovic
"Holding him to 9-22 FG, 1-6 3PT is getting cooked?   Last year in the playoffs Kawhi went off but not against Kleber. According to Second Spectrum, there have been 17 different occasions where an opponent has defended Kawhi on at least 100 half-court positions in a playoff series. (Since 2013-14, which is when tracking began.) Kleber in last year's playoffs held Kawhi to his third-lowest effective field goal percentage (41.4) among that group, behind only Malcolm Brogdon in 2019's Eastern Conference Finals (34.5) and Kevin Durant in the 2013-14 Western Conference Finals (39.7).   The other Mav who has spent a bunch of time on Kawhi in that series was Dorian Finney-Smith, and he got torched: Kawhi had 30 points on 66 half-court matchups with DFS, compared with 44 on 115 matchups with Kleber. His eFG% against DFS is 63.2%, which dwarfs the figure he has posted against Kleber as well.  Kawhi is a top 10 player in the league and will obviously find a way to score, but Maxi is making it as hard as anyone else for Kawhi to score."
Maxi Kleber (Fucking dead) - Out
I really don't get the popularity of this meme with Mavs fans. It seems to really undersell the memory of how good Dirk was by simply comparing any white guy to him.  Like Luka has very little overlap in his game and how Dirk played.  Maxi Kleber is at least from the same town as Dirk so it kinda fits?  Kristaps is at best a Great Value version of Dirk.
"They should completely get rid of this being a technical and Maxi ""Pad"" Kleber needs to stop whining."
"Thats basically what he said, but its to drama free to post ^^  Callie Caplan @CallieCaplan Maxi Kleber on taking Kawhi Leonard's dunk yesterday: ""I had three fouls already, so I couldn't take an early foul to stop the fast break.

His name was Maxi Kleber
His biggest highlight was staring down Maxi Kleber. What a beast
The refs let Morris and PG stand over and yell at Maxi Kleber after that Kawhi dunk so I don't think they cared much about dropping techs for that kind of stuff this game.  [https://twitter.com/TheHoopCentral/status/1396231763106566145](https://twitter.com/TheHoopCentral/status/1396231763106566145)
Maxi Kleber is a very solid defender I noticed it last year when they played the Clips. With his height he moves his feet well and doesn’t use his hands. He’ll probably never “lock down” a great player but he can at least make them work for their points.
"Maxi Kleber, who loved bowling."
Maxi Kleber died for our sins so we could take the dub
"That was an old school, in your face, jam.  I would like to thank Maxi Kleber for his sacrifice for making this play happen. He could have ducked out, he could have gone for the charge, but he went for the block and gave Kawhi the opportunity, and the world is better for it."
Maxi Kleber (29) has died at the age of 29.
&gt; Maxi Kleber was 29.  RIP Maxi Kleber 1992-2021. He was a good man.
Y’all don’t know that being part of any Maxi Kleber fan groups will have you sign a waiver acknowledging he will get absolutely posterized at least twice a season because Maxi just doesn’t give a single fuck and plays like a got damn man.
"Maxi Kleber, Josh Richardson and Dorian Finney Smith are all great defenders...  You're kind of proving my point."
"That make sense.  If we are talking more role players, 3 point shooting and +switchable defending bigs, my top choice would be Maxi Kleber.  He isn't a great defender at the rim or on the perimeter, but hes at least average at both.  He's a high volume and high % shooter out at the 3 point line.    Chris Boucher would be my sleeper pick, tho it remains to be seen if his 3 point % is real or an abberation.  He is a very good rim protector and not a terrible physical mismatch defending switches.  But he's really young so his defense &amp; game is largely still a question mark."

"lol well if your position is trade CJ for Butler then sure, you've solved your problem. But you're not getting Butler. CJ's efficiency isn't astronomical because he's bad at getting to the line, agree with you there. If he could average 6 FTs a game he'd be a true star but he's not explosive or big enough. But his offensive impact is very very good. Look at any on/off, +/-, WAR, etc. stat you want. He's up there with elite guys.  If you think you're replacing that with Norm or someone of his caliber bc you had a stretch where Lillard had to kill himself to keep the team afloat without CJ, good luck. The benefit of CJ is he can give Lillard a break. Get rid of CJ and you'll have no secondary ballhandler or scoring option. Dame's not scoring 40 a night all season. He can do that in stretches to cover for guys, but it's not going to work long-term.  And this is the problem with CJ trades: you can keep braying on about how he's not good enough and should go, but what are you getting back? Replacing him with cheap parts, which is really the only option most people see, isn't going to help the team. You're looking at Harrison Barnes, Josh Richardon/Maxi Kleber type deals. Maybe Jerami Grant, probably not. Good luck with Ben Simmons lol.  And part of ""showing up"" is being productive in the regular season. It's hilarious that people reduce players to playoff losses. How do you think teams get to the playoffs? CJ's been a huge part of keeping the Blazers highly competitive year in and year out with very few quality players around him and Dame.  CJ isn't a good defender, but he's not the reason the entire team stinks on that end. What the Blazers need is to not play the worst defenseive bench imaginable: Simons, Melo and Kanter. That's what sunk the team in the playoffs. They were beyond awful. Totally unplayable. Abused by other starters and backups. Flipping at least two of those guys out for quality rotation pieces who can offer even marginal defensive resistance improves the Blazers significantly. You can't have Paul Millsap destroying you in the playoffs at like 37. That's where I'd start this offseason."
PG: Raul Neto  SG: Paul George  SF: Kelly Oubre Jr  PF: Maxi Kleber  C: Sergi Ibaka
Maxi Kleber ist de Hero for Deutschland!
"He was (a) gassed most of the time due to his offense workload and (b) overmatched. He isn't a 2-way player, he will never be a 2-way player, and in that series, of the 4 ""defensive"" guys we have, one was on Kawhi 24/7 (DFS), one was injuried (Kleber), one played himself out of the rotation (Richardson) and one was Porzingis. Luka was never meant to guard PG, just like Harden would not guard Booker in a Nets-Suns final. He held his own with dignity, he wasn't the liability he was in the early seasons and he wasn't being targeted. That's the max you can ask for your only ballhandler on defense.  Beside, this was a single series. He had a couple of really good defensive games. Charlotte, Miami, Lakers, Denver, SA, Boston. Again, he won't be an All-Defender and he won't be the brick wall Harden is, but he will be average to good as soon as next season, specially if he has any kind of help. Our best defender in the roster right now is Maxi Kleber and Dorian Finney-Smith, and neither are exactly All-Defense nominees."
Maxi Kleber was having to get injections in his Achilles just to get on the court for the Mavs.  It might not sound like a big deal to non Mavs fans but he's at worst their second best defender and it was a huge blow to the Mavs ability to defend Kawhi and Paul George.
He averaged 60%+ FG% against Dorian Finney Smith and Maxi Kleber but only 44% against Luka. Small sample size but it's not like he dominated Luka on offense.
"No. As I said, sometimes guys get stuff wrong, are hearing only part of the story, or are talking to someone who had an agenda.   Which is very, very different from the reporter making it up from whole cloth.    As an example, I would point out how early rumors of issues with Carlisle were unsourced, while the defenses of him were sourced (including by Cuban) and he was gone within two weeks. Clearly the early unsourced reports were talking about *something* accurate and the people going on record were lying through their teeth.  Also, people give way too much credit to players as always being truthful. For example, a whole bunch of Hawks players who are record in the last few weeks about Trae's change in play and how much better everything is now were on record early in the season after the Athletic report, saying that there were zero issues with his play on the team. Or, another, it's easy to find quotes from the players themselves saying there were no issues between Harden and CP3 in the run-up to CP3's trade, for example.   Also: if you're a role player on a team, you have a very strong incentive to say only positive things on the record about your star, because the team will trade you in a hot second if the star wants you gone. It's interesting to me how r/NBA jumps all over the assumption that a reporter must be making stuff up for clicks and completely ignores many players' much more profound incentives. If Luka was the biggest asshole on the planet (and I'm not saying I think he is) do you think Maxi Kleber is going to go on the record and say so? Or is he more likely to grouse quietly to a reporter (or behave in a way where a reporter in the locker room can clearly see there are issues) while publicly saying things are fine?   Players have a very strong culture of ""what happens in the locker room stays in the locker room,"" and guys who are caught violating that (D'Angelo Russell on the Lakers, anyone?) don't stick around very long unless they're HUGE stars."
"That makes no sense, he is not from the Balkan. Maxi Kleber was also not part of the group, is that all we need to know about him?"
Maxi Kleber
Maxi kleber it is.
"Yeah KP, dorian finney smith, and maxi kleber should really be getting more shots! especially given how great they played this playoffs!!    /s"
I personally don't think Myles Turner is the right guy but there aren't a lot of great fits unfortunately. The guy I would love is Maxi Kleber. He gives up size to Turner but he's a better shooter and a more versatile defender.
"I'm assuming you're a Mavs fan, so:   Offseason focus  An alignment between the front office and new head coach  The blank check approach with Luka Doncic: eligible for $200M rookie extension  Finding help for Doncic: projected $20-$35M in cap space but at the cost of Tim Hardaway Jr. and possibly Josh Richardson  The extension options for Jalen Brunson  Year 3 of Kristaps Porzingis ($90M+ left on his contract)  Draft assets  Future: The Mavericks owe New York a top-10 protected first in 2023, 2024 or 2025. The earliest that Dallas can trade a first is two years after the pick to New York is conveyed.  Cash: $4.5 million (to send) | $5.6 million (to receive)  Cap space breakdown  With Doncic in the last year of this rookie-scale contract, the 2021 offseason presents an opportunity for Dallas to maximize cap flexibility. By releasing the cap holds of free agents James Johnson and Hardaway, Dallas projects to have $20 million in cap space. If Richardson opts out of his $11.6 million contract and the $4.1 million team option of Willie Cauley-Stein is not exercised, the Mavericks could have up to $33.5 million. Richardson has until Aug. 1 to make a decision on whether to pick up his deal, and the Mavericks face the same Aug. 1 deadline on Cauley-Stein's team option. Additionally, the $1.8 million contract of Brunson becomes guaranteed if he is not waived by Aug. 2.  Because the cap in 2022-23 is projected to increase slightly ($112 million to $115 million), the Mavericks will have $22 million if they punt on free agency this offseason and Doncic is extended.  Porzingis and Trey Burke both have trade bonuses written into their contract. Porzingis' 5% trade kicker would get voided because it exceeds the maximum salary allowed. The Burke trade bonus is 7.5% of the value remaining on his contract (minus the player option in 2022-23).  Team needs  Shooting guard if Hardaway leaves in free agency  Wing defender off the bench  A power forward to compliment Porzingis  Extension eligible: Doncic (rookie), Brunson, Dwight Powell, Dorian Finney-Smith and Maxi Kleber  Free-agent status  Richardson | Player | Bird  JJ Redick | Early Bird  Hardaway | Bird  Boban Marjanovic | Early Bird  Cauley-Stein | Team | Early Bird  Nicolo Melli | Restricted | Early Bird"
Mavs should be higher. Zingis can shoot so well he stays out of the paint. He can play center against a bench better than Dwight. Mavs need an A+ defender next to Luka. Maxi Kleber as a sweetener?
"""Fuck you, Maxi Kleber! And fuck you, chair!"""
"Haha, but you have watched Luka play, right?   “I’m not saying Young or Ayton are better but it’s definitely interesting to see their teams have success…”  Come on bro, it’s not that interesting.  Ayton is the third best player on a stacked roster. Booker is a king in waiting and CP3 is CP3.   Luka is throwing lobs to Maxi Kleber and Dorian Finney Smith.  Trae is throwing them to John Collins and Clint Capela.  When shit breaks down Luka might have KP to rely on, or he might be hurt. In that case, Tim Hardaway Jr is their next best threat.  The Hawks have Bogdan Bogdan, K’von Huerter and Danilo Gallinari to score the ball if Trae is cold.  I know that no one was big on Atlanta this year, but I thought the roster upgrades were that of a playoff team, and they are clearly a much, much better team than was expected. They are a much better team than the Dallas Mavericks.  Luka might have a bad attitude in some respects, but I don’t recall Michael Jordan being a joy to interact with.  Luka Doncic is one of the best three or four players in the league already. He gets to the basket so easily, he’s so big and strong. He’s an incredible passer, a clutch shooter, and a great competitor.  If the draft happened again, TODAY, Luka Doncic is the unanimous number one pick. Tell me I’m wrong."
"20 shots a game alongside Josh Richardson, Maxi Kleber, Finney Smith, Porzingis, Powell. CP3 was averaging 16 fga in the Hornets at one point in a much slower paced league.  Assuming that Doncic's shot profile would be the same alongside Booker, Ayton, Bridges paints him presumptuously as a guy who will never give the ball up under any circumstances, when he's shown to be a willing passer and floor general."
Doesn't matter if it's his fault. Rudy only does one thing. Rim protection. If every team that can make it past the first round can have him stand in the corner or play 30 feet from the basket you can get Maxi Kleber to do that job for 7 million and he will knock down a few 3s on the other end.
"Literally the problem. I can pay Maxi Kleber 7 million to stand in the corner and rotate over when someone gets beat on the perimeter. It doesn’t really matter if it’s Rudy’s fault. He’s a one dimensional player, and if what he does can be schemed out by good teams what’s the point."
Does it matter if it’s his fault? He brings one thing to the table. Rim protection. If he can’t bring it to bear what’s the point? I can pay Maxi Kleber 7 million to stand in the corner and rotate over and try to recover and he can make a few shots on the other end.
you really need a maxi kleber with handles?
Tyrese Maxi Kleber going ham
"Notably, he also left simmons off of his all Nba team and put Westbrook on the third team. But Jokic was first team for him. So his all-nba ballot isn’t even consistent with this MVP voting.  He also voted for Schroeder and Theis for All defense second team. I believe there are only 5 active German players - those two, Maxi Kleber, Isaac bonga, and Moritz Wagner. Bonga and Wagner basically don’t get minutes.  So he also voted for 66% of the eligible German players for the all defense team (no one else gave theis a vote and I think only one other person voted for Schroeder).  His Twitter feed has basically nothing about basketball other than his about info that says he is based in LA covering US sports for a German publication. But his entire feed is like soccer and slalom and stuff.  Feels like this dude should bit have an NBA vote. There’s plenty of intentional media guys who are way more dialed in."
Luka-Dorian-Brunson-Boban.   Probably can add THJ-Dwight Powell-Maxi Kleber to that mix as well.
"I said this elsewhere, and I’ll paste it here:  As hard as it is for me to say, because I’ve always been a huge Carlisle supporter, this might be a good thing. The Mavs roster wasn’t great this year, but it wasn’t THAT bad. They made the fifth seed in the West, and they have a first team all-NBA player.  KP played the worst basketball of his career this year, and in the playoffs he was non-existent. All of our “Rick Carlisle Reclaimation Project” guys, Maxi Kleber, Dorian Finney-Smith, and Dwight Powell, did NOTHING all series long. They, and especially Jaylon Brunson, looked absolutely unprepared and scared of the big moment in the playoffs. That’s on the coach, plain and simple. It’s not like the guys haven’t been in the playoffs, they all had before! If your team is unprepared, that’s on the coach.  People said KP was in the corner by design. Carlisle has doubled and tripled down on NOT using him as a post up player, or even trying. The KP we saw in the playoffs is who Carlisle wanted him to be. This team is filled with Carlisle guys and the result was the same as last year: first round exit. Yeah, KP’s game sucked this year. But again, who is that on? Coach him up! If he won’t post up, and that’s what you want him to do, sit his ass on the bench and tell him to go lift some weights after the game. You’re the coach, he’s the player.  An extra hard-to-swallow pill is this: Rick got outcoached by Ty Lue. Ty made adjustments, sat starters, went deep in his bench when he was on the ropes. He went and played Reggie Jackson big minutes because he was killing us. What did Rick do? Nothing, he just kept letting Luka play iso ball. No set plays to get his other shooters going, no getting the ball to KP down low. In absolute fact, one could argue Rick lost us the series by sitting Luka when the Mavs were up big in quarter 1 of game 3. We had to foul to get Luka back in the game because the Clippers melted a 20 point lead in like 5 minutes. That, again, is on the coach.  The Mavs were NOT great this year, but they were a solid team with plenty of useful guys that have done things elsewhere. But in the playoffs, they looked like Luka and the Washington Generals. If Rick’s plan was to out-talent the other team, then why do we need Rick? Even I can tell Luka to “go be great”.  The Mavs need a change of scenery. So thanks for 2011, I’ll always love ya Rick, but it was time for a change."
"As hard as it is for me to say, because I’ve always been a huge Carlisle supporter, this might be a good thing. The Mavs roster wasn’t great this year, but it wasn’t THAT bad. They made the fifth seed in the West, and they have a first team all-NBA player.  KP played the worst basketball of his career this year, and in the playoffs he was non-existent. All of our “Rick Carlisle Reclaimation Project” guys, Maxi Kleber, Dorian Finney-Smith, and Dwight Powell, did NOTHING all series long. They, and especially Jaylon Brunson, looked absolutely unprepared and scared of the big moment in the playoffs.  People said KP was in the corner by design. Carlisle has doubled and tripled down on NOT using him as a post up player, or even trying. The KP we saw in the playoffs is who Carlisle wanted him to be. This team is filled with Carlisle guys and the result was the same as last year: first round exit.  An extra hard-to-swallow pill is this: Rick got outcoached by Ty Lue.

"Dallas, Goofy Hardworking Euro Bigs With Non Traditional Skillsets And Loyal to a Fault:   C: Nikola Jokić / Boban Marjanovic  PF: Dirk Nowitzki / Kristaps Porziņģis   SF:  Giannis Antetokounmpo / Maxi Kleber  SG:  Goran Dragić / Tomáš Satoranský  PG: Luka Dončić / Ricky Rubio"
"I’m not, I just said that if the hawks were in the west they would’ve gotten bounced by the full strength clips too   And where did I say sweep?   Lmao he’s selfish averaging 10 assists a game, you’re right the guy shooting 50% from the field and 40% from 3 on like 13 attempts should pass more to the shell of KP or maxi kleber and let them run the show, good call on that one"
KD. Larry bird in this era would be maxi kleber
&gt;that one German dude  Maxi Kleber really is the best Mav ever ngl
"That's Maxi ""Kawhi Stopper"" Kleber to you!"
"Kleber is a lower volume spot up shooter who does little but shoot threes, a worse rebounder and has a higher PER, VORP, BPM and WS, in spite of being on a worse team.  ||Maxi (2020-1)|Lauri (2020-1)| |:-|:-|:-| |3P%|41%|40.2%| |3PA/36|5.7|8.1| |3PA ratio|77.1%|56.8%| |eFG%|58%|59.7%| |TS%|60.6%|61.9%| |TREB%|10.7%|11.3%| |PER|10.1|15.2| |VORP|0.5|0.7| |BPM|\-0.7|0| |WS/48|.103|.109|  They're about even on assists and fouls, Lauri is better on steals, Maxi is better on blocks and TOVs.  Lauri takes 24% of his shots at the rim, Maxi takes 10%."
"Offensively, Markkanen is an upgrade over Kleber. Mavs typically run a 5-out offense with Kleber and KP as their frontcourt. Kleber can hit open threes, but I think it's clear from that 19 and 9 year that Markkanen has potential star upside in a change of environment.  Defensively, Maxi is an excellent mobile big who can switch onto wings. If the Mavs traded him, the big problem would be that Markkanen and KP seem pretty redundant defensively.   Offensively, 5-out can handle skill set ""redundancy"" because floor spacing means they aren't stepping on each others' toes, but defensively the swap could be a problem.  Age is another factor here. Maxi will be on the wrong side of 30 this season and when he's 31 and up for a new contract the following year, how much would we pay to keep him? Markkanen is 24, and could be a change of scenery away from accomplishing his potential. Worst case scenario at a contract that we could S&amp;T for him with and at  his age he'd be an asset.  I love Maxi. He's one of my favorite Mavs, and I think he fits better next to KP. But depending on the contract and what more we'd have to give up I'd definitely consider the trade."
&gt; What we lose on defense we add up on scoring and spacing with Lauri  Kleber has the same career 3p% as Markkanen and shot 41% last season  &gt; he has a significantly more value than Maxi  If that was the case then how come no one has traded for him and why are all the rumors about the market cooling on him?
Yeah im totally fine giving up 30 years old Maxi Kleber for 24 years old Lauri if thats what the Bulls want.
We are not trading Maxi Kleber...
Favorite part was maxi Kleber contesting kawhis dunk. What a hero
Don’t forget Maxi Kleber.  Sextuple Dirks.
[And this](https://youtu.be/01SFIxvq8Z8) by MAXI KLEBER 😂
"Not really. If Lauri took [10] 3's a game over an 82 game season, he would have made 328 if shooting at 40% and he would have made 303 if shooting at 37%. That's the difference between making [4] 3-pt shots a game and [3.7] three-point shots a game. The threat of actually shooting (volume and ability to self create) coupled with a decent percentage is actually what matters. It's why nobody guarded Maxi Kleber in the playoffs ([4] 3pt attempts a game in the regular season on 40+%) and why everyone guarded Luka ([8] 3pt attempts a game in the regular season on 35%)"
Time for Cuban to complete his dream team:   Goran Dragic   Luka Doncic   Maxi Kleber   Kristaps Porzingis   Boban Marjanovic
"Problem is, not every team has a line of former All-Stars begging to play for them on a vet min. Lowry was off as soon as the magnificent city of Miami blessed him with the honor of living there. DeRozan was a huge overpay from the Bulls. A similar offer to us would be Maxi Kleber and Dwight Powell. ""Oh, but those players are replaceable, role players, yadayada"". If you see our rotations in the Clippers series, you will see that we had to give significant minutes to Nicollo Melli, currently on a non-Euroleague team. If you see the games, you will notice how half of our possessions were wasted with Melli or a gassed DFS bricking a corner 3.  We brought defenders. We have now a rotation of wings that can switch 1-4 AND can handle their own on open shots. We could've paid DeRozan, yes, at the expense of THJ, but we could. We wouldn't, however, have any defensive depth on the wings. We would require again vet min contracts, and, unlike the almighty Los Angeles Lakers, the players that considers the vet min for us are *slightly* worse than Nunn and Monk.   Dinwiddie probably wanted to be a clear cut starting PG, considering his plan B was the Pelicans. Lonzo could've been attainable with the right price. Chicago's offer was better than the one that we could offer, but maybe we could've convinced Lonzo to force a move here. Maybe we did, but it did not work. Norman Powell signed on a steal for Portland, cheaper than THJ on production, but, again, the difference isn't that big.   Nico did what he could. He did not hinder the team going for the fences in a nutjob trade for a #2, he did not sit and waited for the Kawhi's pseudo tour while allowing every FA to walk. He took a position of deep need, signed 2 market-friendly contracts in THJ and Bullock and a steal in Sterling Brown. We still have the TPE that we can use to either add a passer (I want us to talk with the Pels for Sato) or a prolific offensive option (maybe Markkanen will accept a discount to play with Luka)."
Bet you didn't know he is actually just the second best player from his hometown to play for the Mavs.   The best is Maxi Kleber
"Luka Doncic, Goran Dragic, Maxi Kleber, Lauri Markkanen, Kristaps Porzingis with Boban Marjanovic as the sixth man. Cuban has clocked his game."
I mean PJ Tucker and Maxi Kleber are basically only spot up shooters. Obviously the game has moved towards every player being more position-less but Ariza and Crowder don’t really ever play the 3 and they basically only shoot 3’s on offense. I guess it just depends on how you define a stretch 4. Imo Portis and Collins play the stretch 4 role in a modern offense. If anything I think what’s changed is that people are starting to value rim running centers in spread offenses.
“Maxi Kleber is the next me”
Sounds more like Maxi Kleber
"Oh shit they're already have Latvian Dirk Nowitski and they're going to add Finnish Dirk Nowitski?!   And they still have the German Dirk Nowitski, Maxi Kleber!   Damn"
Projects as a slightly less athletic Maxi Kleber. Productive rotation guy on the right price.
"[BREAKING] Lakers sign-and-trade Dennis Scrotum to Mavericks for Dorian Finney-Smith, Maxi Kleber, and a second round pick."
"Obviously not on the same scale as Collins, but Maxi Kleber?  He’s roughly the same height and weight, has similar stats. I mean yeah Collins is more of a rim attacking player and Kleber more extended to the perimeter. But both are gonna offer you similar sort of style of play from the Power Forward position albeit Collins at a better level."
Tobey really should get a 2nd look from NBA scouts. Stretch 5 that is a lob threat and can rebound. Very similar to Maxi Kleber
"I think you're overrating how much 9 a season is... Even if you don't think Caruso is very good, he's still probably worth 9  Tristan Thompson, Jeremy Lamb, Maxi Kleber, Rodney Hood. I clicked through a bunch of teams rosters and excluding rookie deals these are the guys making 9-10 million. 9 million is not every day starter money"
I thought maxi kleber and Daniel theis were German as well.
"if Maxi Kleber goes back, then its a net zero on whites"
The Hawks are better. Would you trade Clint Capela for Maxi Kleber? Dorian Finney-Smith for Danilo Gallinari? Tim Hardaway Jr. for Bogdan Bogdanovich?
I love how people assume Luka forces people into the role of a spot up shooter when in reality that happens because we only *have* spot up shooters around him.   Who else is supposed to put the ball on the floor for us? Maxi Kleber?
Please get him over Maxi Kleber that guy stinks
"Mavs all-time franchise leaders in blocks per game by PFs from Würzburg, Germany:  1. Maxi Kleber: 0.9  2. Dirk Nowitzki: 0.8  Elite company."
Can someone point me in the direction where I can ask what people's thoughts on maxi kleber are
"We were sold a bill of goods that Josh would be our lock down defender... Maxi Kleber was given the Kawhi assignment.     That said, I think JR may have better luck in Boston.  He's a good role player, I more question Rick Carlisle's black balling of certain players and letting them rot on the bench for months at a time."
"&gt;is ass outside of Luka KP and Hardaway  That's not true. DFS, Brunson and Maxi Kleber are all really solid role players. Our biggest issue is that we don't have a quality secondary ball handler and could use an upgrade at the 5."
"If that was Maxi Kleber in the playoffs, that’s a brick"
If that was Maxi Kleber that’s a brick
"Alright. Let’s list a 12-man roster for each team.  Team USA starters: Curry, Kawhi, Bron, KD, AD Team USA Bench: Harden, Thompson, George, Butler, Holiday, Draymond, Lopez/Turner/Allen if we really need a big body.  Team Europe Starters: Doncic, Bogdanovic, Bogdanovic, Antetokounmpo, Gobert Team Europe Bench: Jokic, Gallinari, Porzingis, Sabonis, Vucevic, Capela, Valanciunas  Now, for team USA:  - Team USA has All NBA talent written amongst all of them. Their offense is unstoppable — everyone can iso, everyone can move off the ball, open looks everywhere, and have great ball movers.   - Also, everyone can shoot. Everyone also has IQ, on both ends. Their defense can be weak at times (when no AD can anchor the defense, but Dray at the 5 or Lopez/Turner/Allen can work okay just not great) but their guard/wing defense is also unstoppable. Kawhi/Bron IQ off the charts, and these are just from the starters.   - Everyone is good/borderline elite at on ball or off ball defense. Not a single one of these guys can be hunted on the mismatch (aside from the obvious point guard being hunted for the big man, but we have Holiday who could play for Curry if he gets hunted a lot). They can’t hunt anyone on iso’s. They can switch everyone on defense. Literally there’s nothing that this team can’t do.   On the other hand, we have Team Europe.   - Your starters have elite offense, Luka-Giannis PNR would be unstoppable (but it would kind of not work because Gobert clogs up the paint).   - Giannis is also a non-shooter, and team USA can deploy the Giannis wall to stop him. And even if he makes the right read and makes the right pass, team USA’s defensive IQ + defensive personnel is enough to either close out or rotate on the open man.  - Gobert can’t run the PNR with Luka (he can only run it with Conley) but even if he can run it he can only finish lobs, so if they deny him the lob his other option would only be to pass, since he doesn’t have a post game.   - That bench lineup is also sus, they lack a ballhandling guard (could use maybe Dragic here, but if you have at least 2 of Luka/Jokic/Giannis on the floor then playmaking wouldn’t be a real issue) OR a defensive wing (OG Anunoby could be good here).  - You also have bucket getters in both the Bogies but they’re only average on defense (including Luka as well).   - Gobert’s defense can be schemed against (see Clippers vs Jazz series) and if they replace him with someone like Jokic or Vucevic their defense will very much take a hit, the USA squad will feast on it.   - Capela is also a paint clogger, and everyone else is at most average on defense (and this is me being generous lol).   - Also, you got Porzingis, who’s a spot up shooter who can’t really bang anyone on the low post despite being a 7 ft giant lol.   (Btw, this is the best European players of 2020-2021. If you wanna replace anyone here, you could replace them with the likes of Evan Fournier, Dennis Schroder, OG Anunoby, Goran Dragic, Maxi Kleber, Jusuf Nurkic, Enes Kanter, Lauri Markkanen.)   So, after doing a bit of research, I must say that the USA team has no glaring holes in them (assuming that AD plays at the 5, otherwise their biggest hole would be center, and even then I’d say that Lopez/Turner or even Allen are serviceable enough that they can, at the very least, apply pressure and slow down anyone under the rim but not outright stop them completely). Team Europe tho, their bench is really average defensively but everyone is pretty good offensively. No one is really elite here (except for Jokic, Luka, and Giannis; although 2 of these are average at defense so they’re only elite offensively). Not to mention that there are more potential superstars in the upcoming future, this isn’t to mention Zion, Morant, Mitchell, Young, Booker, Edwards, Mobley, Cunningham, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Chet Holmgren. Heck, we could even throw someone like Mikal Bridges or Trey Murphy III, who could be very very good defensively (and offensively we only need them to knock their 3s down). Europe has maybe at most a few, and even then they’re not guaranteed to be superstars (only Luka was the most recent one).  So, as of now, and in the future, Team USA &gt; Team Europe."
Sucks that Maxi Kleber isn't playing for Germany. Would have loved to see our guy out there
"Sure!  1. Adrian Dantley 2. Alex English 3. Wilkins 4. Kidd 5. Melo 6. Pau Gasol 7. Tony Parker 8. Chris Mullin 9. Mitch Redmond 10. Webber 11. Penny Hardaway 12. Brandon Roy 13. David West 14.

Ramon Sessions 26. Juan Toscano-Anderson 27. Nerlens Noel 28. Maxi Kleber 29. Eric Bledsoe 30. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  These thirty are all convincingly ahead of him too imo, so that eliminates him from being top sixty."
"I watched almost all of the Mavs games during the regular season + playoffs and Josh Richardson had so many opportunities to handle the ball and create for himself + catch and shoot from Luka, he did terrible in most of them, in such a way we had to progressively cut his minutes as the season went on because he was such a liability on offense his defense didnt make up for it. By the time the playoffs arrived he almost got no minutes and his confidence was completely shot.  This has nothing to do with fit with Luka or Brett Brown, the guy is straight up not that good, period, he had the ball on his hands plenty of times to create or assist, he was not Dorian Finney Smith or Maxi Kleber just waiting for a 3 standing still, he was just bad."
"NBA website for defensive tracking. You can go to Luka's profile &gt; Stats &gt; Matchups (Playoffs) &gt; Head to Head. You can see that he held Kawhi to 21 points over 7 games on 43% FG shooting. If you do the same with Maxi Kleber and Dorian Finney-Smith, you'll see that they let Kawhi score at above 60% FG shooting."
Maxi Kleber.
Why aren't Daniel Theis and Maxi Kleber not in the squad. Are they injured?
"Yup, Jason Kidd, Dirk, and Maxi Kleber"
"At the end of the day it comes down to how the roster is built. [There’s a dearth of playmaking specifically.](https://www.bball-index.com/playmaking-data-viz/) I have no worries about Luka’s off-ball abilities — I’ve reviewed enough tape from his time in Madrid and with the Slovenian NT where he played a hybrid on/off role next to another quality playmaker like Dragic/Llull/Campazzo/...  The problem is that Cuban hasn’t bothered investing in playmaking — he and his gambling buddy are trying to moneyball the shit out of the roster and want to have Luka do everything. The clearest single example of that was early in the 2019 FA Mavs had a 21M TPE from the Barnes trade and Donnie Nelson had an agreement with the Heat (who wanted space to sign Butler) in place to absorb Dragic’s expiring (for free!) — Cuban&amp;friend went back on the deal. They weren’t interested in having Luka play off ball. The entire closing lineup (Hardaway, Finney-Smith, Kleber, KP) are all shooters but none are good playmakers, certainly not playmakers for others.  Watching Luka play for Slovenia in the Olympic qualifiers was such a breath of fresh air in comparison — his teammates there obviously aren’t as good as NBA rotation players, that’s not the point — legitimate advantages were routinely created by plays where 4 guys touched the ball. Having players who are decisive and able to make simultaneously quick&amp;correct decisions is important. Mavs don’t have those.  As for Brunson: minutes when Luka and Brunson overlap worked well offensively in the regular season. Regardless of which was off and which was on. Many fans were regularly calling to start Brunson over Richardson. In the playoffs Brunson flopped — but no amount of play during the season would have helped him deal with 6’7” wings switching on him on one end one after another and going at him on the other. Love the guy, but the lack of height and athletic predisposition is *the* reason why the NCAA *something* player of the year dropped to the second round, and it showed in the series.  ——————  The roster needs to get better. And it needs to fit better. KP’s presence helps with spacing, but him and Luka do not fit on D in the slightest — KP’s contract makes him unbenchable and his physical limitations after two knee surgeries in a three year span limit him to playing drop and zone only — except now he’s nowhere as good a drop defender as he was, and *needs* the other guy to get over the screen. But that doesn’t at all fit with Luka (or Hardaway, or Finney-Smith) who dies on screens — while the one competitive defensive advantage of having a jumbo-primary-ballhandler of being able to switch evaporates. When KP plays with Brunson the D is good. When Luka plays with literally any other big the D is just as good — because they can play a more aggressive scheme.  |player(s) on|player(s) off|DRtg| |:-|:-|:-| |Luka, KP||117.7| |KP|Luka|106.7| |KP, Brunson|Luka|106.6| |Luka|KP|107.8| |Luka, Maxi|KP|107.7| |Luka, Powell|KP|105.9| |Luka, WCS|KP|104.3|  Note this includes ~25 games that KP missed, so it’s not overwhelmingly Luka&amp;Big versus benches.  If Philly decides they want Lowry in a S&amp;T, they need to drastically reduce their payroll so they can get under the hard cap. I’d absolutely love to send KP to Toronto and get Harris (highest paid Philly player) back to help them out and to get a better suited player who’s a way better playmaker and can switch. KP would actually work well on the Raps — FVV/Suggs(?)/OG/Siakam can navigate screens — and KP’s size and spacing would be great training wheels for Suggs who also doesn’t need to get paid during KP’s contract."
Just using NBA players they are all pretty stacked:   &amp;#x200B;  **East Europe**:   C: Nikola Jokic / Nikola Vucevic / Jonas Valanciunas  PF: Domas Sabonis / Kristaps Porziņģis / Lauri Markkanen  SF: Giannis / Bojan Bogdanovic  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic /   PG: Luka Dončić / Goran Dragic   &amp;#x200B;  **West Europe:**  C: Rudy Gobert / Clint Capella / Mac Gasol  PF: Maxi Kleber / Pau Gasol / Jakob Poeltl  SF: Danilo Gallinari / Nic Batum   SG: Evan Fournier / Frank Ntilikina  PG: Dennis Schröder / Ricky Rubio  &amp;#x200B;  **Asia/Oceana :**   C: Steven Adams / Aron Baynes  PF: Rui Hachimura / Andray Blatche  SF:  Joe Ingles   SG: Jordan Clarkson / Matisse Thybulle  PG: Ben Simmons / Patty Mills  &amp;#x200B;  **Non-USA Americas:**   C: Chris Boucher / Dwight Powell / Lucas Nogueira  PF: Kelly Olynyk / Tristan Thompson  SF: Andrew Wiggins / Bruno Caboclo / Nicolas Brussino  SG: RJ Barrett / Dillon Brooks   PG: Jamal Murray / Facundo Campazzo / Raul Neto
"Luka played a better team with less help, whereas Jokic played a worse team with a better roster. Outside of a few Tim Hardaway and Maxi Kleber stretches, that Mavs team was singlehandedly carried by Luka against a healthy Kawhi and PG"
We got Maxi Kleber and JJ Reddick…
Maxi Kleber did the same thing to cost the Mavs a game against the Lakers. I still don’t understand why defenders would help off of a 3pt shooter when it’s a 3 point game with a few seconds left. Give them 2 points and play the free throw game up 1 with the ball. Better than giving up a wide open 3
Darius Garland  Pat Connaughton  Isaac Okoro  Maxi Kleber  Jakob Poetl
A default Video-Game Char would never be black. Its probably someone like Maxi Kleber.
No one is as classy as Maxi Kleber
But is he as classy as Maxi Kleber?
"I’ve seen a lot of people picking the Mavs to have fewer wins than last year (transcribed to 82 games).  I know the worries about Kidd as a coach have a lot to do with it, but I think of those fears end up being justified, we’ll see them justified in the playoffs.  I think people either don’t realize or forgot that the mavs were absolutely ravaged by covid last year, and Porzingis was also out at the beginning of the year.  We started the year 8-13 this is our lowest point of the year and also happens to mark the point where we got our last player back from covid (Maxi Kleber).  After we got all of our players back, we went 34-17, which was one of the best records in basketball over that time.  I think this team is going to have a lot of regular season success and I’d personally be shocked if they weren’t s top 6 seed in the west.  Just some food for thought."
"These kinds of takes are the worst for me. I respect tf out of Luka, but he only won games when other shooters went scorching hot - THJ and Maxi Kleber in 2021, Seth in 2020."
"Yeah. Even if he shot 39% from three-would he really be a 3&amp;D guy? Normally this term is used for players that play above average defense, but are quite limited in the offense-they shoot threes and that’s basically it. I guess Turner provide a bit more. Also as a Dallas fan I think Maxi Kleber or Finney-Smith deserve a honorable mention-Kleber shot 41% for three last season; Finney-Smith 39,4%. Both played solid defense throughout the year."
"First THJ and later Maxi Kleber with Kawhi, just getting boomed on dunks. It's got to be rough being forever associated with a poster, but damn I love how they don't give up on a possession like a lot of other players would.   I can definitely see why Knicks fans were sad to see THJ go even though he was overpaid and not shooting amazingly with them. THJ has been such a fun player and I love his attitude, hustle and grit so much."
"Do a malicious compliance and also play the Canadian anthem, then Slovenian anthem for Luka, Germany anthem for Maxi Kleber, Serbian anthem for Boban and Latvian anthem for Tingus Pingus"
"PG - Luka SG - THJ SF - Reggie Bullock PF - DFS C- KP  Bench:  Guards: Jalen Brunson, Trey Burke  Wings: Sterling Brown, Josh Green  Bigs: Maxi Kleber, Dwight Powell, Boban, Moses Brown"
Maxi kleber
"I lowkey think Simmons best fit is with a role-playing center who can shoot like Maxi Kleber. KAT is as good a fit as you’re gonna get when it comes to elite centers, but if a center is your best player idk if Ben is ever a great fit."
"The Mavs have consistently gotten quality production out of frankly, some kinda random players. Like no hate on Jalen Brunson, Maxi Kleber, and Dwight Powell, but they are not the most talented dudes in the league. Despite that, they have played key roles for the team. IMO that's one of the biggest signs of a quality coach, getting the most out of every player.  I wouldn't be surprised to see the Mavs roster outside of Luka look way more dysfunctional this year compared to previous seasons despite very little change in its makeup."
"I do wonder if our definition of what's neutral or good is different. To be clear I'm talking about his impact and fact he is a center generally helps that.  I can see your point as well though. While Jokic grades as slight positive on most defensive impact metrics LA-DRAPM does have him as slight negative.  In any case overall I guess it comes down to what you consider neutral defense for example. If you compare him to other anchor big's you could say he's below average, however most anchor big's tend to be above average.  On D-LEBRON his last season (0.61) grades him as around top 75 defender out of 247 players that played over 1000mins that season. This would put him among players like KAT, Jayson Tatum, Maxi Kleber, Montrezl Harrell and Pascal Siakam.   For me I would consider most guys in this 0.3 - 1.0 range to be slight positives on defense. Usually these are players that have at least few notable issues or limitations that stop them from being clear positive, but who also have some strong points and do enough to where you can be fairly certain that at least they aren't hurting their teams on that end. I think alongside of Jokic KAT and Josh Jackson are really good examples of this."
Maxi Kleber

I’m a Maxi Kleber stan  Trade Luka for a 2nd rounder
imagine being a Maxi Kleber stan
Giannis &gt; Luka  I’m a Maxi Kleber stan
"I get asking your best players’ opinions on certain things. That’s pretty standard practice to some extent depending on the team. The issue with a formalized “council” is players knowing who’s on it.   So you know who to blame if you’re Maxi Kleber or WCS and you thought you deserved to start over Powell: Luka, THJ, and KP.   And if Kidd stops playing all 15 guys, other players might wonder whether the 3 guys no longer said they wanted that or maybe outright said they wanted a smaller rotation or worst of all maybe they chose specific players to not get playing time. Even if Kidd makes the decision, there’s gonna be some doubts now that this is public."
"I cry every time I have to think about my Mavericks extending Maxi Kleber and Dwight Powell, then trading away Seth."
There's no way OG is 6'7. It looks like he's much bigger than Dwight Powell and Maxi Kleber.
Maxi Kleber?
"&gt; poor mans version of putting shooters around luka  This. We have guys like Maxi and DFS who you would think are knockdown shooters when looking at their 3pt% but when you did deeper they aren't. [Out of players that played at least 30 games last season](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shots-closest-defender-10/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CloseDefDistRange=6%2B%20Feet%20-%20Wide%20Open&amp;sort=FGA_FREQUENCY&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=GP*GE*30), Kleber was #1 in wide open frequency with 61% of his 3s taken being considered wide open. DFS was ranked #6 with a wide open 3pt frequency % of 55%. If anyone just decided to play normal defense on them I'm sure their 3 pt% would drop. Hell, DFS [only shot 30%!!](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shots-closest-defender-10/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=FGA_FREQUENCY&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=GP*GE*30:PLAYER_NAME*E*dorian&amp;CloseDefDistRange=4-6%20Feet%20-%20Open) on shots considered open. This is not only a testament to Luka's abilities to get people open but it shows that we don't really have any pure shooters on our roster.   I was just explaining to another fan on our sub how it's a shame we haven't been able to get a sharpshooter outside of Seth during Luka's tenure and how it's killing us. Really the only way we can be efficient is by having Luka drive and kick out but we can't do that if we have to feed KP in the post. I wonder how many games it'll take Kidd to realize this."
"Yeah that's what the awesome Mavs offense from the last 2 years needed : less Luka Doncic pick and roll, more KP and DFS post up.  Thank god coaching mastermind Jason Kidd is here to show them the way, maybe he should try to post up Maxi Kleber too next game"
"They got Jalen Brunson in the 2nd round and Maxi Kleber and Finney-Smith were undrafted. Considering they’ve had few 1st round picks outside of the one they drafted Doncic with, this is a very weird narrative."
"This is actually a very interesting question for the Mavs since it was a year post-championship after Cuban didn't bring Tyson Chandler back.  11-12: Jason Kidd / Vince Carter / Shawn Marion / Dirk Nowitzki / Brendan Haywood   21-22: Luka Doncic / Tim Hardaway Jr / Dorian Finney Smith / Maxi Kleber / Kristaps Porzingis   &amp;#x200B;  I think I'd take the current starting lineup over the champion defending lineup, especially since that team was dealing with the Lamar Odom issues."
"As a mavs fan, I was all in for a Kp- Simmons trade but at this point  I wouldn’t even give them Maxi Kleber."
"Using some of our current players, it would be something along the lines of:   Luka/ Goran Dragic  Tim Hardaway Jr./ Reggie Bullock/ Danny Green  Mikal Bridges/ Dorian Finney-Smith/ PJ Tucker  Robert Covington/ Maxi Kleber  Myles Turner/ Nerlens Noel   The 2011 team had a ton of excellent defenders and vets on it, this team is still much younger than the 2011 team though lol"
Well give them Maxi Kleber and $10
"Jeez. The amount of effort these nephews make me do.  2021 Clips vs Mavs 3P stats  Game 1 - DFS 4/5, THJ 5/9  Game 2 - THJ 6/8, KP 3/4, Maxi Kleber 2/2  Game 3 - THJ 4/6, Maxi 4/7, Jalen Brunson 4/6, Clips still win (lmao)  Game 4 - Mavs only score 81. Luka sucks.  Game 5 - THJ 20 points, Kawhi and PG both suck  Game 6 - THJ 23 points, Monstrous Kawhi performance takes Clips home  Game 7 - THJ 4/7, Mavs still suck."
"Mavs were shooting close to 50% on threes, a major reason why they actually won 3 games against us. THJ, Maxi Kleber, and Seth last year just couldn't stop draining shots from beyond the arc.   Ask Luka to stay alive in 4th quarters, play defense, or make atleast half his FTs, and he might actually win a playoff series, who knows."
Not sure if anyone has said this but Maxi Kleber is the most underrated 2nd jumper in the league. I swear he played volleyball or something. He blocks shots on 2nd jumps
"Sounds like there were a lot of issues. Apparently Luka disliked how Carlisle treated Maxi Kleber (who I think were friends from their Liga days?). Then there was the whole Carlisle/Voulgaris thing, though not sure how much of that is true."
"It’s infuriating, it seems personal because Luka will constantly kick the ball out to Maxi Kleber, DFS and Josh Richardson, all worse or equal shooters than Porziņģis. Maybe it’s completely coincidental, but even if it is, Lukas got to get better at looking for KP.  Brunson, THJ and Burke all seemed to pass it out to KP more than Luka. I love Luka and obviously he’s better than Porziņģis, but he can’t do it all. Porziņģis shooting 38% on an open 3 is a much better option than a 35-40% contested Luka midrange"
Maxi Kleber
He’s approaching Dirk levels of accent fading. Dirk (and Maxi Kleber to an extent) clearly sound foreign but they speak so well that it’s not abundantly clear where they are from accent wise imo
confirmed that Maxi Kleber has an Android instead of an iPhone
"Well we need some people on our roster to put the ball on the floor. He also really isn't too bad at it. You cannot have only one guy pressuring the rim and expect to succeed. It's not gonna be Maxi Kleber/Dorian Finney Smith/Reggie Bullock/Dwight Powell/Willie Cauley Stein/Josh Green putting the ball on the floor. Luka, Brunson, Hardaway, and Porzingis need to be able to attack the rim."
Embiid being a good 3pt shooter doesn’t matter much if he spends 90% of his time inside the arc. Also the fact that embiid is a fairly poor passer makes the situation worse. Simmons would fit way better next to maxi kleber than embiid.
"Bit early to call but yeah, I tend to agree:   **2020**: Josh Green at 18 and left Saddiq Bey, Tyrese Maxey, Immanuel Quickley and Desmond Bane on the board.   **2019:** Dennis Smith Jr at 9 and left Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo and John Collins on the board.   Luka Doncic, Donovan Mitchell, Saddiq Bey, Kristaps Porzingis, Dwight Powell/Maxi Kleber."
"In no way, am I saying we have good roster construction. I'm mostly agreeing with you, but you're just a bit wrong on some situations/taking it too far. Dwight Powell is not an ok wing defender, he's pretty bad honestly. He also isn't very good at the PNR anymore because his athleticism has major declined. He takes quite a few terrible attempts at the rim too.   Completely agree there's not enough NBA starting caliber talent, but that doesn't mean Kleber/DFS/Bullock can't be valuable pieces. If the rest of the talent is there, all three of them can slide in as a starter. But the issue is having three of those guys without the talent around just pins everything onto one player. Kleber, like you said thought is 100% a 4. Our best lineup is when he plays PF and Porzingis plays Center, but I think the coaching staff wants to protect KP's health and limit his fouls by playing him at PF.   I also think you are imprinting a bit of Knicks KP's problem onto current KP. He has become a much better rebounder on the Mavs, and has been decent defensively. Agreed that his interior presence is very on and off though. Occasionally, there's just plays at the rim, where its like why did u have no impact. I also think he's much more willing to bump inside offensively than in the past.   There's just lot of teams that I think would love some of the guys on our team, but for us its just constructed poorly. I think Maxi would be great for Portland. Bullock was great for the Knicks last year. Dorian could play a Jerami-Grant type role for Denver. They aren't bad players, but they aren't talented. And they need someone to make plays for them at ALL TIMES."
"I agree but that itself is an issue, he's the best at everything on your team.   Best rebounder best playmaker best shooter etc.   He's gotta do everything  and luka isn't the greatest defender in situations other than 1v1 in the post. especially with his conditioning not in a good place this season he can't close out on shooters very well, he's kind of mediocre fighting through screens and dropping on the pick and roll defense  maxi kleber might be a little bit better off ball defender than luka but luka is usually good to jump 2 or 3 passing lanes per game and grab some steals at least  either way there's no rim defense, 26th in the league that number has to get better.   I think in theory with a better overall defensive roster luka would look a lot better cause being an oversized point guard should give you an advantage at a traditionally difficult position to get good defense"
"Absolutely. They’re blowing him out of the water impact wise, because he’s been that bad.   But, they’re role players. You can trade them or even bench/cut them if they have a bad stretch and you’re not losing any sleep over it. That’s what Kemba Walker is being paid yet everyone keeps bringing up the number like it’s this big number of dead cap holding us back from signing a superstar. If Maxi Kleber god forbid goes down for a season no one is gonna say “oh my god they’re paying him $9M!? what a blow!”"
&gt;Maxi Kleber and Royce O Neale are also being payed $9M  What does this mean? These two have been way better than Kemba. Like WAY better.
Maxi Kleber and Royce O Neale are also being payed $9M… everyone keeps quoting that number like we’re not one cap-increase away from that being a taxpayer’s MLE  Al-Farouq Aminu made $9M just last year. like damn it’s not THAT much
"Why would the Mavs trade a 25 year old Brunson (he's on a $1M deal), they would need to also add Dwight Powell or Maxi Kleber to salary match.  Most Dragic deals were centered around either Josh Green + salary filler or just one of Powell/Kleber."

"Because our center rotation is shit  KP can't play all his minutes at the 5 due to health preservation. Even then, hes a good rim protector and blocke but he isn't a strong body.  Powell has dirt on Cuban 100%. Why else would this guy still play so many minutes for us.   Oh wait, it's because next up is Willie cauley stein. when he's engaged he might be a tolerable backup. I can count the number of times I've seen him engaged on one hand. And that hand is closed in a fist.  Maxi Kleber is actually pretty legit defender. But he's coming off injury, and isn't quite big enough to stop the real bigs. He's an ideal defender against stretch/small 5's.  Boban is awesome and fun and can't really play more than 12-15min a game realistically. Usually more like 5-10. He's situational because it's easy to play him off the floor by going small.  That is not the C rotation of a contender. And it's the starting point for 90% of our defensive frustrations."
"Wizards announcer calling Maxi Kleber ""Keebler"""
"That is pretty much accurate, except for Maxi. I've not seen Maxi slander this year. I'll physically fight with anyone that contests Maxi Fucking Kleber."

Fucking maxi fucking kleber
Luka  Tim Jr  Tingus Pingus  Maxi Kleber  Boban  Dorian Finney Smith  Jalen Brunson  Sterling Brown
Maxi Kleber is out too. The triple Dirks are down to 1 Dirk.
I understand the idea of NFT's in certain instances because everything is moving digital (like the concept of NFT's replacing trading cards for instance). However the price speculation is insane. Just went and checked NBA's Top Shot and apparently a Maxi Kleber highlight went for 6K. Gotta be money laundering
"Our bench is very solid rn, its our starting lineup that lacks versatile players outside of Luka/KP. Frank Ntilikina has played very well, Reggie Bullock was a key starter for the Knicks last year, and we still have Maxi Kleber who was injured tonight.   But I'm convinced Dwight Powell is not even a 9th or 10th man in other teams rotations. Like you guys are 4-8 and both Poeltl and Eubanks are better than Powell. Even on non-playoff teams, I don't think Powell would deserve minutes. Our center rotation is BAD."
"No. Luka Doncic spent a total of 14:22 mins on Kawhi, over 7 games, the third highest on Mavs the last playoffs.  He allowed him to shoot 54.5%. Maxi Kleber and Dorian Finney Smith spent more time than Luka on Kawhi. Maxi for 38:26, while allowing 63.2% and Dorian guarding him for 29:48, and allowed 68%.   The year before that, Luka spent 9:17 mins guarding him,  4th highest on the Mavs. He allowed 62%, but for only 8 shots. DFS spent 28:12 on him, and allowed 41.4%. Maxi spent 27:07 and allowed 50%, but on a significantly higher number of 56 shots, the most shots he attempted against, besides Jerami Grant.  For Nuggets, Jerami Grant spent the most time defending him, with 56:13, the most by any player. He also allowed 43.9%, attempting 57 shots.  Jokic guarded him for 8:55, allowing 53%, on 26 shots.  Murray guarded him for 8:55, allowing 56% on 16 shots.   So your point about Luka guarding Kawhi for ""good amount of mins"" isn't even true. And it seems that it was Grant who did the most of the guarding on Kawhi, and doing a good job. Grant would probably be the second best player on Mavs. This has nothing to do with Jokic, it's just that Nuggets had a better team."
"By design. Kidd's 1st priority was clearly make KP valuable again, either for us or for other team. He is treating KP like a Walmart AD that can shoot 3s, KP have free reign to fluctuate between the 3-pt line and mid range on offense, and he is essential to our transition offense.  This concept was miserable against the Hawks because KP played like a C, but after that, it's undeniable that is working. He is engaged, he is selecting his shots better, he is involving others. It is understated how many possessions would end last season with KP chucking a bad efficient 3 with 20s on the shot clock and giving a free rebound to the other team. What everyone knew, though, is that an engaged on offense KP equals an engaged on defense KP.   Rick had KP protecting the rim on drop, which led him to be bullied by almost every C not named Poeltl (somehow KP have Poeltl's number). Kidd have KP on help duties and he is a lot better. He had a clutch block against the Celtics, for an example. What we need is Maxi Kleber back. Rim protection on defense and, even though not a prolific screener, he stretches the court on offense."
"Coincidentally, I think Dallas would have lots of interest. Don't really think there is a trade package that makes sense though. The only thing that really works money-wise would be KP for Horford + Marcus, or something like Maxi Kleber, DFS and Josh Green. And I doubt Boston would have any interest in either package."
Aight I’m going to pray to my Maxi Kleber shrine so his back can be fixed quicker
isaac bonga and maxi kleber right
"luka, kristaps and Maxi kleber........i guess one"
"I thought so too when we first traded for KP but I think Luka would actually fit better with a rim rolling big or a true 3&amp;D big like Maxi Kleber. KP is too fragile to do a lot of pick and roll as the roll guy. He can pick &amp; pop but it's not as effective as the roll. And while he can shoot the 3 and space the floor, he clearly prefers to post up and shoot mid range shots off the dribble. So it turns out, they actually aren't as great a fit as you'd think on paper.   I was really hoping we would get Richaun Holmes this past offseason because I desperately want to see Luka with a better rim runner than Dwight Powell. At this point I hope we can just find a way to get rid of KP's contract without giving up too many assets in return and just try again in free agency I suppose."
"thats true but if you shuffle the pieces around luka and KP their team defense could improve too.  I thought they should have made a play for nerlens noel last year and run him at C.   if they can pry valanciunas away from new orleans he would totally revitalize their defense.   but they need to get the guys signed, the mavs have run the same starting lineup for 3 straight years at this point  the mavs are like obsessed with starting dwight powell at center and he's just awful.   he's got butterfingers and he can't defend for shit.   mavs fans theorize that cuban is fixated on trying to make dwight powell work because he came along with rondo in the disastrous trade with boston and given rondo's infamous exit cuban is obsessed with trying to ""win"" that trade by making powell a thing.  offensively the KP/luka pairing was their most effective scoring engine last year, if they are going to move on from that it needs to be replaced with something better not just bumping maxi kleber up in the rotation"

This Maxi Kleber guy is also from wurzburg. That's funny... Dirk's son is also named Maximilian.
Shout out to MAXI KLEBER with his SIX BLOCKS 🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻
We have two superstars and the rest of our team is trash. Trade everyone and build around Jalen Brunson and Maxi Kleber.
I mean Maxi Kleber is doing pretty good.
Maxi Kleber DPOY
Where's Maxi Kleber when you need him?
"Luka KP Jalen Brunson Tim Hardaway JR  Maxi Kleber Dorian Finny Smith Willie Cauley Stein Trey Burke  Tough leaving Boban off the list, but these are definitely the 8 most important Mavs. Not sure anyone from our team would be taken tbh. Richardson, James Johnson, Powell, and Iwundu have been underwhelming and we haven't seen much of anything from our rookies yet"
#MAXI KLEBER JERSEY SALES GOING TO THE MOON 🚀 🚀 🚀
"Yeah he may not be Derrick Jones Jr. or anything but he's got ups for sure  My personal favorite dunk is the one he had against the mavs last year where he kinda half eurosteps from the FUCKING FREE THROW LINE and bodies maxi kleber  Even the mavs bench reacted a bit like ""holy shit where did THAT come from?"""
Our sub is overrun by you Maxi Kleber stans smh
Maxi Kleber. MPJ for Maxi and a 1st
Maxi Kleber. My idea is Maxi and a 1st for MPJ
"Denver should try to trade for Maxi Kleber. Not too many PFs who can guard the rim well. I think he'd be easier to get than Myles Turner, who's another option. Maybe Maxi and a first (plus more??) for Michael Porter Jr"
"Tyrese Maxey, not Maxi Kleber"
Maxi Kleber the Embiid stopper
Tyrese Maxi Kleber
"Tyrese Maxi Kleber would be 25 years old, and 6'6. He'd have great handles and shot creation and very solid defense and athleticism. I'd say he'd be a great above average role player wing. Still some untapped potential. I'd say he'd be like...Harrison Barnes maybe? Solid shitpost"
"Maxi Kleber  dude's a solid piano player so you know he'd crush at Guitar Hero.  Honestly think that might be the toughest game for a lot of these guys, who have giant hands and maybe not the best individual finger dexterity.  Maybe Chris Paul if his bowling skills hold up on ski-ball."
Leave maxi Kleber out of this!
I'll still says its Maxi Kleber but after he got COVID he hasn't been the same. But yeah WCS has been our best defender thats how pathetic this team is
"Drummond is a good defender, and certainly much better than *checks notes* Maxi Kleber and Dwight Powell."
"Exactly. The Mavs aren't loaded in the front court either. Their other big mans are Dwight Powell who just recovered from torn Achilles, Maxi Kleber who's more like a stretch 4, and Willie Caulie Stein, who just sucks. And they are still trying to get rid of KP who is on his first year of max contract. Red flags everywhere dudes how can those fans not see it."
"According to stats, Damian Lillard is a slightly above shooter, if you follow the typical route of 36% is average, 40% is good and 45% is elite. He's averaged over 38% twice so far, at his best. Maxi Kleber would also be having a better shooting year than Lillard has ever had."
"For some, Maxi Kleber is a no name role player on the mavs. However, he happens to be one of my favorite players in the league because he gets posterized all the time.   He literally will contest EVERYTHING at the rim no matter what. The guy does not give a single shit if he gets dunked on. I love the commitment and the fact that he never gives up on a play. It makes him a great defensive player and much better rim protector than he may look like to a casual fan"
Maxi Kleber
Giannis. Embiid can't defend Maxi Kleber.
I'm willing to give him the benefit of a doubt because of covid. JRich and Maxi Kleber still look pretty rough at times.
Zion  Maxi Kleber
"Dallas:   * Missing 5 of our 8 best players for 10+ games with COVID (Maxi Kleber, Dorian Finney Smith, Jalen Brunson, Josh Richardson and Dwight Powell), they've been slow to get back to form. * Missed our 2nd best player for the first 10 games due to surgery. Porziņģis has also been slow to shake off rust but is getting there.  * Most difficult strength of schedule to start the season (first 20-25 games I believe)"
"lmao they aren't even considering Portland who is down 2 starters, or Dallas (who OP even failed to mention) who was missing Kristaps Porziņģis, Josh Richardson, Jalen Brunson, Maxi Kleber, Dwight Powell, Dorian Finney Smith for 10+ games. That's 6 of our top 8 guys, plus we had the most difficult schedule for our first 25 games."
Maxi Kleber was -24 tonight and played 25 minutes. Thank fuck he didn't play 26.
"Sure, but switch those two around and the Clippers beat the Nuggets fairly easily.    Too many players can defend Kawhi successfully(Jerami Grant and Maxi Kleber both did well on him last year), and he's not capable of forcing switches the way other elite offensive players are. And on defense, he's just nowhere near as impactful as AD."
"Porzingis played 14 games, Finney Smith played 16 games, Maxi Kleber played 14 games, Josh Richardson played 16 games.   that's basically their entire starting lineup + a few bench guys.  CJ and Nurkic each played 13 games so there isn't much difference in time missed.   on-off numbers don't tell you much, because you don't know who else is sitting in that time, if they are playing their entire bench line-up or like to stagger. If their bench unit is better than the opposing bench unit etc."
Giving up game icing 3s to Dejounte Murray and Maxi Kleber in back to back games. Sadness.
"Because he’s a 6’4 20 year old with a 7’1 wingspan who can shoot, dribble, pass, and defend. Oh and also because Kuzma was paid 13 million...  I mean shit if Taj Gibson, Trevor Ariza, Bobby Portis, Thaddeus Young, Maxi Kleber, Aminu, Corey Joesph, etc got paid 9-10+ million then THT definitely will..."
"They don’t have to attach picks   They could trade Lou for a player with a “bad” contract that the Clippers might want, like, for example’s sake, Maxi Kleber. The Mavs would be equally interested in getting off that contract, and the Clippers would get a rotational big  Just an example"
The mavs were missing maxi kleber when they played the jazz.. didn't realize he was half the mavs team.
Maxi Kleber reborn after the win
"The narrative will be that they choked, but our defense was incredible down the stretch. Maxi Kleber, Dorian Finney Smith and Josh Richardson put on the clamps tonight."
Maxi Kleber died for this Mavs win. An admirable sacrifice.

RIP MAXI KLEBER
Maxi Kleber was 29.
RIP Maxi Kleber. We hardly knew ye.
MAXI KLEBER IS DEAD
"We have two true centers in Boban and Willie Cauley-Stein. Neither are starting options, nor do they mesh super well with our starters. Dwight Powell is a roll man that cannot space the floor or defend, he's very limited, and Maxi Kleber is undersized as a center and is more of a PF who can play spot minutes at SF or C.   Porziņģis is a 4/5, more so a PF in the regular season and a Center in the playoffs. I think pairing him with a center who can switch out on the perimeter would be smart. Having Holmes if we could get him for $15M a year would be great. He'd be a roll threat for Luka, while KP can pop on the perimter or take his man off the dribble. He's a decent rebounder too. None of our bigs are starting caliber for a contender aside from Porziņģis and maybe Kleber."
