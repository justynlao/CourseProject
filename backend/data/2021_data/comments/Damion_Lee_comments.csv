"I’m getting tired of Draymond. I don’t think his leadership and direction outweigh his lack of production. No ones asking him to get 30 every night but he needs at least like 8. His defense is even hit or miss. Idk him yelling at Damion Lee for his own bad pass really rubbed me the wrong way, if he can’t back it up he’s gonna lose the locker room sooner or later"
"Wiseman, Paschall, Wiggins, Oubre and Damion Lee"
Yeah ofc he’s gonna look good when he’s guarded by Damion Lee
Never seen Damion Lee miss a shot
"Yikes, Damion Lee wtf was that?"
"Just to add this, the on off stats are poor when comparing two players from two different teams. It is very contextual. For example a player could be the heart and soul of a team but the team could also have a capable backup center and maybe a Barea type backup point so the second unit offense runs well. At the same time you could be a good but not great type like a Clint Capela but because your backup is like an Isaac Hartenstein type your on off numbers are stilted. Much like this, maybe the starting five works well and has great players and your center Jordan Bell is playing with those Curry and Thompson and looking good in the advanced stats but your David West type solid backup is all of a sudden surrounded by Damion Lee and Quincy Cook types"
He wasn’t even in the tunnel he walked towards the bench for two seconds. If he “started shit” why would Damion Lee dap him up after? It’s crazy how it’s cool for one player to stand up for a teammate but not another.
"People cant respond now?  I dont know if he wanted to brawl. It looked like a typical confrontation to me.  If he wanted to fight, Damion Lee would not have dapped him"
"Damion lee, michael mulder, wiggins, shitt wiseman is shooting 40% from deep."
"this happened to chicago.  i think the last team in the league to lose on a buzzer-beating 3 when up 2 was...chicago.  against golden state on the damion lee 3.  as a rockets' fan, the same thing happened to us last year.  i feel your pain."
Damion Lee throwing bullet passes
"Moving Wiseman to the bench was the right move. He's playing with a lot more confidence and can actually score against second string players.   Oubre is looking better, he's reverting to the mean, as most of us expected him to eventually. Hopefully we can avoid any more wild downward swings from the mean (a few upward would be nice though lol)  Curry is the heart and soul of this team, but the double and triple teams are getting to him. He's still Steph, but he's not making as much magic as he usually would, there's just not enough space. Klay will be such a boon next season, even if he's only back 80%. This team is a contender with Klay. Next season will be fun.  Wiggins is a badass this year. He should be All-Defense. He's turned into such a reliable complimentary piece, just like Klay.   Dray is doing Dray things. If only he could shoot the 3 ball at even a 33% clip. Oh well. Still a valuable player.   I love Mulder. Maybe because his name reminds me of the X-Files. But he just doesn't seem to do anything wrong. He shoots lights out and fits the offense well.  I'm excited to see Mannion grow, I think it was smart to buy low on him. He's going to be alright. I could see him being our backup PG in a year or two.   Damion Lee is so intriguing. A little more consistency and he'd be a surefire starter. I like his game.    Anthony Edwards shows lots of flashes but I'm not convinced yet. His defense sucks. I'll give him a pass on offense since they didn't have their two best players and their coach is a moron. But he needs to develop better defense, a better handle, better shot selection, and better passing to be a positive asset.  I like a lot of Minny's players, they just don't seem to play winning basketball. They need some serious help."
We have Oubre’s Bird Rights at least. But if Baze gets a nice offer then the Dubs will have to use most if not all their tax payer MLE depending on the offer...and we’ll need that to sure up the backup 5 and backup 1 positions. Damion Lee is signed for next year which is nice. Fingers crossed for Kent
"Damion Lee: 17pts, 3stl, 83% from the field and 80% from 3 in 24 minutes"
Someone plz tell Damion Lee to shave
That’s that Damion Lee type block lol
Damion lee trying to go through his legs and split the defense simultaneously is one of the most irrational displays of confidence ive seen in a while
Sandwiched between Damion Lee and Montrezl Harrell...
"???? Why would you randomly bring up damion lee when there are so many other players from the warriors who have never really worked out? You act like GSW can develop everyone.   “These guys are only busting because the players suck.” So what’s the excuse for Kevon Looney, Damian Jones, Patrick McCaw, Jacob Evans, and Jordan Bell? All draft picks for the Warriors that never amounted to anything."
He means Damion Lee.
"Seriously, look at Damion Lee.  No way in hell most draft ""busts"" don't have *at least* as much natural ability as that guy, usually significantly more.  Now DLee busts his ass, always, and no doubt gets some off-season practice time with his brothers-in-law and/or father-in-law which will help too, the man puts in the work.  But barring injuries, a draft bust who sincerely *wants* to be good, and is willing to work hard and do his absolute best? (Which isn't all of them. A lot of naturally gifted guys are able to cruise on natural ability through lower levels of the sport and aren't ready for the leap to the NBA.)  Those guys are only busting because the coaches suck."
"True. We already saw OKC having 3 MVPs and Ibaka on their squad and still squander it all away.  I think the Franchise needs a reset in the sense of what are the short term and long term goals. For the annual goal, I would presume it would be to blood Dlo and Edwards while at the same time keeping KAT happy. Even If the wolves finish at the bottom, it should be ok if their youngsters get mins. I mean, look at Damion Lee and Paschall at the warriors getting lots of minutes last season.  They can compete in 2-3 years, but they need patience and development. The latter is very hard to pull off..."
eject Curry he just assaulted Damion Lee. 2 techs throw him out
"The warrior team right now is totally different from the warrior in the Steph cornbraid era that required a damion lee haymaker to beat the Chicago bulls.  They still improving, so it’s hard to tell."
"&gt;Yeah, important to remember that Dray and Looney are basically the only people on this team who've ever played with Steph before.  This is Damion Lee erasure."
Damion Lee is Zaza confirmed
Popping in the Game Thread to say Fuck Damion Lee.
Damion Lee: “I slapped the shit out of him”
"That seems a little harsh, he's come up with some clutch 3's in their wins, and I really think his defense has been great in all the games I've watched. Oubre's mistakes have seemed to come from not understanding the system or where he should be, I don't see many instances where Wannamaker doesn't know what his role is or where he's supposed to be on the floor.   Also Jordan Poole has been the worst player to be on the floor. And also what other PG do the warriors have for the bench unit? Do you trust Paschall to be the pg? Oubre? Damion Lee? Because any of those guys filling that role lessens their impact."
"I mean even when the Warriors were at the peak of their powers, their ring-chasing vets were guys like Nick Young, David West, Zaza Pachulia, and Omri Casspi on his way out of the league. If the Warriors want a good bench going forward, they're going to need to build it with pick-ups like Damion Lee or late picks like Paschall and Smailagic."
"Bruh, *come on*. This is going to sound insulting but I promise I don't mean it to be but that is one of the worst basketball takes I've seen on this sub (that's not something just outright crazy).  Who is Draymond Green getting moved to the bench for? Eric Paschall? Why do *you* think Draymond Green will be moved to the bench? Because he's not a shooter?  If Kerr was going to change the starting lineup he'd have already moved Damion Lee into Oubre's spot and played Oubre mostly in non-Steph minutes.   Paschall is a scorer first and while he's improved defensively and as a play maker he is **nowhere** near Draymond's level at either.   You have to understand Draymond isn't just about what he does individually. He literally improves everyone on the floor with him. It's not a coincidence the Warriors looked so much better once he finally started playing.   Go watch Warriors games. Watch Draymond every possession. Watch him direct guys on where to go. Watch him call out actions and switches. He literally thinks for all five Dubs on the floor with him.   He's also knocking a lot of rust off and recovering from COVID symptoms that reportedly lingered for him. That high pick and roll with Curry is still one of the most efficient plays in basketball and literally no one in the league does it better.   It makes absolutely zero sense to move Draymond to the bench and it won't happen this season or next season short of some kind of injury that dramatically impacts his ability on the floor."
"Before this season started, there were five players who've played a full season alongside Curry - Draymond, Looney, and Klay were the main ones, Damion Lee had half a season, and then Bazemore played alongside Curry seven years ago.  Most of the team has almost zero experience playing with Curry in the game - that's just going to take time to get everybody up to speed and on the same page.  If Klay wasn't injured, it'd be a lot easier because Curry, Klay, and Dray could just show them how it's done and they'd catch up - plus Oubre would be coming off the bench instead of starting."
&gt;  Paschall looks great but he’s really the only guy exceeding expectations   Is Damion Lee a joke to you?
Damion Lee and Steph. They’re always clownin each other on social media and hyping each other up during games. Makes sense since they’re in-laws.
"I also gotta shout out Damion Lee for being the absolute glue of that unit. The spacing he provides, plus his nose for the ball &amp; hustle, are a huuuuuge part of our bench unit over-performing."
"Yes, I am. Not sure what your point is...  Did it bother you when Wiggins outscored Curry versus the Pacers?  Or when Wiggins, Oubre, Paschall, and Damion Lee outscored Curry versus the Raptors?"
"Damion Lee, clutchest curry"
"Ya, Oubre looked much better with that unit. I wouldn't mind seeing them try Damion Lee or Bazemore with the starters instead of Oubre, but I think Oubre is a better defender than either of those guys"
"Honestly most of our losses have felt kind of unlucky. Both Pels games Lonzo and Bledsoe turned into Steph and Klay, suns were like 21/33 from three at one point against us, CJ and Melo became literally unstoppable in the 4th and Pascal's potential game winner rattled in and out, Damion Lee flopped on a 3 pointer and got the game winning points off a bad call.   Obviously some of those things are somewhat our fault but I still don't think our record really reflects us properly."
"I mean he just needs scorers. If you surround him with damion lee, jordan poole, and fuck juan tuscano, then yeah, he won't thrive, as his game is playmaking. If you surrounded him by Joe Harris, Lou Will, JJJ, and Aldridge, he'd still be incredible"
"I'd hate to see some of these young players get Covid and develop long-term heart or lung damage. Someone like Damion Lee a couple years removed from the G-League is not in the same boat as Steph or Harden or even a lottery pick rookie.We still don't know what the long-term consequences of asymptomatic, mild, or even non-fatal severe cases will be, so it could end some careers. Personally I'd love to see all essential workers get a higher priority, but I'd rather every transportation worker and grocery store worker get it before the NBA players."
Damion Lee is the dumbest player in the NBA.
Lmaooo! Damion Lee really knows how to sell it
Is Oubre really playing more than Damion Lee just because the contract Kelly has?
"where the fuck is warriors best 3pt shooter, Damion Lee"
Damion Lee and Kevon Looney
Honestly may have been the worst 4th quarter I have ever seen from the warriors. God damn. Don’t know why at one point damion lee was guarding turner
This game is setting up Damion Lee to hit another game winner
"Damion Lee really absorbed the Curry shooting gene just by banging Sydel, huh?"
Does Lee’s parents own a stake in this media company or what goddamn show me some highlights that aren’t Damion Lee
Damion Lee carrying us rn. Love this dude
Damion Lee holy fuck
We could've used Damion Lee in general in 2019. Instead we had Quinn Cook
We could have used any Damion Lee in the 2019 Finals
"Lmao, Damion Lee is balling."
"man, the Warriors couldve used this Damion Lee in the 2019 Finals"
"I don't see why we would trade Zach Lavine unless he wants out. If we're bad enough that Lavine doesn't stay, then trading him for James Harden or Bradley Beal probably just leads to them asking out now.  If we were going for a trade, I'd trade him for future draft assets. On that note, the Pelicans, Warriors, and Thunder become the instant trade partners to look at. I think the Warriors have the most prime draft asset with the Minnesota pick, so I'd go after that.  The most reasonable trade is probably something like Kelly Oubre, Kevon Looney, Damion Lee, the 2021 Minnesota pick, 2026 Golden State pick (converts to 2nd if it conveys to Memphis), and 2028 Golden State pick, and maybe a pick swap or two for good measure."
Damion “Klay Thompson” Lee
"Only time will tell but there is too much talent on this roster for them by outside of the top 8 teams, even in a loaded West.   Curry is still super good, Draymond is one of the best defensive players in the league, Wiseman's potential is huge and Wiggins has been playing pretty well. Eric Paschall has been excellent as a small ball center, Damion Lee has hit some big shots for us at the end of tight games, and Bazemore has been really good both defensively and offensively.   I think if they can make it through the end of the month, playing all those good teams, and still be above .500 they'll get more respect."
"kyle fouls damion lee of all people on a game winner. We were up at least 10 on portland most of this game and multiple times. Spurs game we actually should have won. Sixers we were up most of the game and gave it away. Stanley Johnson getting lots of pt. Look at CJ's winner tonight, almost no resistance. This isn't a team desperately playing to actually win. Otherwise they should probably be .500 at worst right now."
lol did u see that Damion Lee 3pt attempt last night
"I think you linked the wrong video. Yours shows Kyle Lowry fouling Damion Lee, not ripping his arm off."
[Damion Lee in 5 years](https://youtu.be/BGTIq4yO-og)
"Warriors team basketball, 7 players double figures, Steph always on top of +- despite the poor scoring performance. Damion Lee 3p so far 1.9/3.9 on a .487 and Eric Paschall very consistent and reliable from the bench. Draymond almost with a triple double and high basketball iq. Oubre horrible but energetic. Time will tell but this team might actually make a somewhat run in the playoffs."
&gt;~~Damion Lee~~ Bruce Lee
"Warriors outscored the Raps in the first 3 quarters, Raps made a run in the 4th and we were mostly awful but won it off some clutch Damion Lee FTs and Wiggins defense"
"If currys the new draymond, damion Lee is the new curry, then is draymond the new Klay????"
Curlee Rivers can shoot.  Pretty happy with Damion Lee so far this year.  He's pretty agressive.
Damion Lee took Steph's powers to get revenge from his last year's choke job against the raptors.
"We've gotten rid of a *lot* of G League / 2-way talent that went on to have great careers. Boucher is just the most recent in that line. Morrow, Tolliver, Dedmon, Watson spring to mind. Hell, Seth Curry was a G League call-up with us originally. Also, Damion Lee was called up from our G League affiliate, but by the Hawks. Same with Kendrick Nunn to the Heat."
Lol Damion Lee scissor kicking to get a call on the last play
Damion Lee constantly drops on the deck and flops like a fish. He basically lives on the ground. I love him.
DAMION LEE IS A GUN!
"Starting to feel like Damion Lee &amp; Baze are this team’s reliable bench players in the same way that Barbosa and Mo Buckets were in Kerr’s first season, (Barbosa &amp; Mo averaged 7.1 and 10.4 PPG that season, respectively)."
Yes Steph played bad but if he got half the calls he should have this wouldn’t have been this close and Damion Lee with that bet move
Damion Lee got it goin on
"Of everyone on Golden State, open shot, the fate of the universe on the line, the Martians have the death beam pointed at earth, you better hit it, I WANT DAMION LEE"
"Damion ""Step Curry"" Lee &gt; Steph ""Kelly Oubrick"" Curry"
DAMION LEE: THE CLOSER
damion lee becomes bruce lee
Damion Lee has just saved Steph’s entire legacy.
Is Damion Lee the most clutch player in the NBA or in all of NBA history?
Damion Lee clearly just saved his legacy.
damion lee with two game winners this season and you motherfuckers still wont call him the third splash brother
Damion Lee comes in clutch
Damion Lee or Bruce Lee? What the *fuck* was that.
this can’t end like this. i didn’t watch 2 hours of very shitty basketball to end with damion lee free throws smh
Damion Lee thought he was Bruce Lee and karate kicked mid-air lmao
The balls on Damion Lee when Steph was asking back for the ball
BRO IT'S DAMION LEE YOU DON'T NEED TO TOUCH HIM
lmaoooo Damion Lee clutch again
Damion lee has been in this exact same spot and fucked it up against the exact same team
I never thought I’d see the day that Damion Lee adequately guarded Pascal Siakim on a one on one drive to the hoop.
"So, I guess Damion Lee is the best Warrior off the bench.  Best rebounder, very good shooter now.  Plays better defense than anyone but Looney."
curry family now has four. Seth Steph Damion Lee and Austin Rivers
JR and Chris Smith  Damion Lee is the Curry's BIL and he can play
"Don't forget Looney, Juan Toscano-Anderson, Wanamaker, and Mulder with some quality defense off the bench. Damion Lee is coming into his own too."
"We have some high percentage, low volume shooters in Mulder and Damion Lee. Wanamaker and Wiggins have been okay I think, and Steph is Steph. So it's not super surprising that Oubre would be a huge minus to the percentages."
"Klay, Steph, and Looney were out for most if not all of the season. Then around November, Damion Lee (broken hand), DLo (thumb), Draymond (heel), Jacob Evans (some sort of strain) were simultaneously injured.  Then later on in the season, Draymond was out the entire month pre-Covid shutdown and both PGs sprained their ankles in the same game."
His minutes are definitely starting to get squeezed... hopefully he finds his role with the team that he can thrive in. Michael Mulder and Damion Lee gonna be higher in the rotation.
"Okay fine--  &gt;That would make sense if we assume Dame is an average player  Usually average players don't take a ton of shots in the last 10 seconds of close games. You're comparing Dame to other primary options in this scenario. Here is the list of players who have taken at least 3 shots in the last 10 seconds of a 1 point or tied game:  LaVine, Murray, LeBron, Booker, Mitchell, Tatum, Doncic, CP3, Dame, Brogdon, Siakam, Steph, Beal, Hield, Sexton, Damion Lee, Fox, Sabonis, VanVleet, Grant, KD, Jokic, DeRozan, Giannis, Quickley, Embiid, Kuzma, Lowry, Dort, Harrell, SGA, Terrence Ross, Rozier, and Myles Turner.   For the most part besides Quickley, Kuzma, Dort, and Damion Lee those are all #1 or #2 guys on their teams and not average players at all. So really comparing Dame to league average FGA on these one possession close game shots isn't comparing Dame to average players at all, it's essentially comparing him to the average #1 or #2 option for any given team."
"Tough finish by Damion Lee, he’s stepping up in the clutch"
Still never seen Damion Lee miss a shot
anyone else see that dude on charlotte laughing at/with damion lee
"Damion ""TJ McConnell"" Lee"
"Because KP is traded for Damion Lee and his wife, S. Curry?"
"And don't forget let's open up our wing rotation for next season which is... Klay Thompson coming off of two years of injuries, Damion Lee, and Jordan Poole."
Damion Lee is David Lee’s son?   When did this happen?
&gt; Damion Lee  i think he balled out on a few 10 day contracts on the Hawks which was the real key
"Draymond's offense:  RAPTOR impact metric puts him at a slight positive and 3rd highest on the warriors this season (after Steph and Damion Lee who having a ridiculously efficient season)  There's also a lot of evidence from the 17/18 and 18/19 seasons, even when Draymond offensive stats dropped down, he still always had a positive impact on offense.  Is it limiting? Yes, but is it the thing to blame if they lose? No.  &amp;#x200B;  Can warriors contend in 2021:  Weirdly enough the warriors defensive rating is 5th and offensive rating is 20th, with an overall net rating of +1.4 (11th in league). Let's be conservative but say Klay changes it very slightly to +3.0 which can bump them into top 8.  In a stacked Western conference it'll be still hard to really contend for the chip, but for some reason maybe through experience or coaching the Warriors might have a bit of an advantage in a BO7.  I think the bigger factor's than Draymond's shooting is:  1. Can everyone stay health 2. Can Wiggins and Wiseman be reliable and improve 3. Roster changes including potentially Timberwolves' 2021 pick.  &amp;#x200B;  One meaningless unsubstantiated comment as well - Playoff Draymond is built different."
"I’m obviously a little biased, but I disagree. He will talk up opposing players and give them props for big moments (for example he loves to talk about how amazing Damion Lee is at free throws).   His calls on the game winners against us I can remember were still hype for the other guy (look up the Lavine call).  And overall, our broadcasting team seems to talk a lot more about the opponents than others I’ve watched. It’s a nightly occurrence that you hear Eric say some shit like “Dell, did you know that Mike Muscala’s paternal great grandfather frequented the same barber as Jimmy Stewart?”"
"Kerr probably thinks playing Steph an extra 30 seconds is gonna make him tear his Achilles. Guy’s literally playing less minutes than his MVP season, but nope, we gotta load manage him for that deep playoff run that we’re obviously guaranteed to go on because of Brad fucking Wanamaker.   We’ve dropped at least 3 games this season thanks to Kerr’s idiotic rotations. Don’t even get me started on why the fuck Damion Lee closed out the game instead of Bazemore"
Damion Lee anyone?
"People need to chill with the Bucks slander. Yeah they're struggling but as long as they have their 5 guys for the playoffs, no one knows how good they'll be. So far this year in 252 min, their starting 5 has a +8.1 net rating which indicates they'll be pretty fucking good.   And what the fuck is the point of saying what the Warriors record was last year? They didn't have Steph and were a brand new team outside of Draymond and Damion Lee. Of course they were gonna suck. Chill with the clickbait bullshit."
"If you play off ball i don't care who you are, you need SOME form of passer. BECAUSE you are playing offball. Who's it gonna be now that Draymond is out? Wiggins? Oubre? Steph's a great passer but he ain't passing to himself.  We're not even talking about needing some great passer, you just need A passer lol. Wiggins, Oubre, Wanamaker, Damion Lee, Paschall don't count.  Now the warriors could just run pick and roll again and again like they do in the playoffs, where the need for a passer would be much less needed, like when Mike Brown was coaching, but Kerr clearly doesn't subscribe to that."
Brad wannamaker and Damion Lee
"unfortunately, the same goes for Damion Lee for having such a hot start to the season"
The warriors easily have the best G-league bench with damion lee and wannamaker paving the way
Damion Lee what the fuck is that
"The defense is atrocious with the bench unit. They play 6’6” Eric Paschall at centre and Damion Lee at power forward with the bench unit lmao. I think it’s just weird early season small sample size stuff. According to the nba tracking, Wiggins is also the second best iso scorer in the nba. The Spurs used to have a better defense and net rating with DPOY Kawhi off the floor."
Damion Lee has a game winning 3 and a game winning set of FTs this season.
"At about five different points you can tell he realizes it’s a false equivalency and just pushes ahead with it. See how he feels when it’s Damion Lee dogging it on the court next to him and demanding a trade. Elitism in all aspects of life. When he says “we” he’s not talking about players in general, just “superstars.”"
Still can't believe Damion Lee blocked someone XD
"You're really out here acting like a team giving heavy minutes to Brad Wanamaker, Mychal Mulder, Damion Lee, and Juan Toscano Anderson (who is great but he's 6 months removed from the g-league) is the same as those Houston teams."
"Lmao yeah apparently 6 MOY Gordon and guys like Ariza, Capela, and Bev were ""scrubs"". Curry is trying to make it work with guys like Damion Lee and Mulder"
"Oladipo literally immediately turned into an All Star the moment he got away from Westbrook's ball dominant offense and Sabonis got a lot better too.   Steph would take either of those two over Juan Tascno Anderson, Kelly Oubre, Brad Wanamaker, Damion Lee , Mychal Mulder.   Oh yah and we haven't had a single center for 6 games, so yah I'd take Steven Adams right now, who was a far better offensive player on that team then any of our currently centers even when healthy. (yah yah yah I know Wiseman has more potential than Adams but he is so young and inexperience understandably that he hasn't been a good offensive player this year)."
"&gt;Yes he does. You do not let Dame shoot. Ever. Same as with Steph  I don't get what you mean by this. Obviously both shoot plenty of times per game. Teams don't intentionally leave them open, but that's true for plenty of other players too. That isn't really what people are talking about.   In most of his possessions Curry runs laps around screens off ball to create openings for himself and his teammates. Curry has a quicker release than Lillard and is much more comfortable taking shots without much separation (Lillard has said this himself). This makes it much more difficult for defenses to stay on him through screens, and frequently results in teams overcommitting to him and leaving the second man open for a run to the basket.   This is the main thing people are referring to when they talk about Steph's gravity. We have several extremely high efficiency drives and 3s that are generated every game by players overcomitting to Steph, primarily on off ball screens.   You can see this in the TS% of our role players, here's the TS% this year vs last year for a lot of our guys that don't create their own shots.     Player | 2021 | 2020 ---|---|---- Mulder | 68% | 53% Looney | 66% | 40% Lee | 64% | 55% Bazemore | 64% | 53% JTA | 64% | 53% Poole | 60% | 45%  These guys take almost exclusively uncontested 3s and uncontested or lightly contested drives.   This has been a pretty consistent trend over the Warriors' run with Steph Curry. We've had guys like Jordan Bell, Damion Jones, and the 37 year old ghost of David West average over 60% TS for a season next to Steph.   When people talk about Steph's gravity the main thing they mean is that his assist total does not remotely reflect the amount that he improves his teammates shot quality."
"Damn. I guess I won't be getting a Damion Lee ""Sydel Husband"" jersey then."
"I really love Damion Lee on the play waving the other guy to stay for stretching the space after he passed the Draymond, expecting a Curry 1v1, and then immediately go for the potential rebound. And also, Draymond Green is useless. Zero threat to score, and all 10 people on the court knows he'll just screen for Curry there."
"Ehh... Damion Lee has regressed to shooting poorly, Paschall hasn't really had playing time + coming back from injury, and Wanamaker is a net negative every time he steps on the floor right now.  The bench is being saved by Wiggins most of the time, and even then it's not enough because the 2nd unit has almost no spacing."
"Damion (Curry) Lee.  Sydel should've made him take her last name too, it gives a +5 shooting buff."
Don't forget about the goat tank commander damion lee
"Good bounce back after that 20 turnover disaster yesterday.  Much better team effort, better rebounding in the 2nd half and solid defense really made a close game at half an easy victory.  Still, can’t wait until either Looney and/or Wiseman get back.  Have to tip my hat to Damion Lee, he’s really become a good bench player, very consistent."
"Haha Spurs commentator just called Mulder, Damion Lee."
&gt; everyone just looks despondent and don’t even wanna look at him.  What's Kelly Oubre or Damion Lee or Andrew Wiggins going to say? They're a bunch of scrubs.
It blows my mind how much some people in this thread are misunderstanding his thought process. There's no way he came out of that timeout not knowing how much time was left on the clock. And there's no way he thought he had a chance to make that. He knew that the best play for the Spurs was to foul him before he could get the ball to Steph. He figured he would try to get 3 free throws instead of 2 so they would actually have a chance.  I don't even know why he was on the court. That's on Kerr and so is the fact that the play he drew up wasn't good enough to make sure Steph gets the ball. And Damion Lee should not have thrown it to Draymond. He should have made sure that Steph got the ball.
Damion Lee is such a high energy player off the bench
Damion Lee with the interception
LMAO do you know basketball? What will Damion Lee even do when he is open after Curry was doubled?
It could stand to reason though that having attention taken away from you by Steph Curry/Jerami Grant could result in a fairly different outcome statistically than Damion Lee/Josh Jackson
Damion Lee isn’t the 12th guy tho.
Nah this isn't best guards. It's best backcourts. By definition that's two guards who play together. Neither Wiggins nor Oubre play like guards. It'd be Steph and Damion Lee or he and Wanamaker. Luka and Brunson have a case though and are probably deserving over some of the bottom teams.
"Damion Lee is fine for his contract imo, $1.7M. Smailagic on other hand has not shown any improvement this year, and while I was hopeful for some development (and even defended him) he didn't do anything even in the G-league bubble."
"How many guys do you think are sitting at the end of an NBA bench because of connections or because a player with influence wants them around? Damion Lee isn't making big money; he costs 1 roster spot. If the team likes him and steph wants him around, then it's worth it since those end-of-bench spots are basically interchangeable.    The truth is, there are very few difference makers in the league. Damion Lee can play basketball and that's good enough."
"What’s damion Lee particularly good at? It’s not defense. I guess he’s one of the few that’s been inside the system so he doesn’t look lost as much but do you really think he’d be getting signed by someone else? He’s on the roster because of his relationship with Steph, nothing else."
Based on advanced stats Damion Lee should be playing among that bench
"Man I hate our fanbase. Smiley barely plays and we used a second round pick on him, that's whatever. And Damion Lee is a perfectly serviceable bench wing."
"We aren’t good enough anymore to enable nepotism so much, both in the organization and on the roster. Smiley and Damion Lee are not nba caliber players and the roster is too weak to carry dead weight. They need to clear out family and friends and bring back actual basketball people. Things are NOT good right now."
"That team was like 8 players deep and who were capable offensively playing big roles in the offense. You're not a true Rockets fan if you think Jordan Poole, Damion Lee, and Eric Paschall are on par with 2015 Motie, Brewer, or Josh Smith."
Curry makes that call. He calls Lacob. Curry agent talks to Embiid agent who talks to Morey who says all picks and Ben.  Damion Lee ends up in Philly too somehow.
"You’re telling me Damion Lee, Juan Toscano Anderson, Nico Mannion, Mychal Mulder, and Jordan Poole would all get minutes on other teams when we picked up half of them up from the G League?"
"Did this dude just compare 19 year old who played 3 games to Bogut who had a decade of NBA experience at that time? For his argument Centers take time to know the game.   &gt;7th seed right now if they had just not signed Oubre and drafted nobody   So Steph-Lee-Wigs-Dray-Looney is 7th in West. Damion Lee and Looney vs 7 seed Mavs Hardaway and Josh Richardson. LOL! Not to mention Mavs got Brunson &gt; Poole coming off bench.     Lamelo is NBA ready but a closing line up of Steph, Klay and Lamelo wont scare LeBron or Kawhi in the future. Lamelo is a worse target on defense than Steph. LOL!"
"Bogut came back to the Warriors in the 2018-19 season for 18 regular season games.  Technically, it could have been Damion Lee too."
"As you can see by the table below, Curry and Draymond are doing their best to right a sinking ship. Bazemore probably has such a high On-Off because he usually comes in for Oubre (or Wiggins) and as such, doesn't have to play with Wiseman as much.  I'm also surprised they don't give Mychal Mulder more minutes.  |||||Posi|Posi|Posi|Posi|Posi|+/-|+/-| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Rk|Player|G|MP|PG%|SG%|SF%|PF%|C%|OnCourt|On-Off| |1|Andrew Wiggins|50|1617|||48%|48%|4%|-4.0|-5.0| |2|Kelly Oubre|48|1468||35%|39%|25%|1%|-5.5|-8.1| |3|Stephen Curry|42|1419|86%|14%||||+2.2|+11.4| |4|Draymond Green|42|1273||||65%|35%|+1.3|+7.9| |5|Damion Lee|49|927|1%|62%|35%|3%||-1.9|+0.8| |6|Kent Bazemore|48|784||33%|51%|15%|1%|+6.5|+13.1| |7|James Wiseman|36|781|||||100%|-10.7|-12.5| |8|Eric Paschall|39|676||||33%|67%|-7.2|-6.7| |9|Brad Wanamaker|39|625|66%|33%|1%|||0.0|+3.1| |10|Juan Toscano-Anderson|35|609||49%|42%|8%||-2.0|+0.4| |11|Kevon Looney|39|599|||||100%|+2.4|+6.3| |12|Jordan Poole|29|505|28%|58%|13%|1%||-8.4|-7.6| |13|Mychal Mulder|41|412|86%|14%||||+1.7|+4.8| |14|Nico Mannion|19|275|100%|||||-11.0|-9.7|   Provided by [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Original Table](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2021.html?sr&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool#pbp) Generated 4/5/2021."
"One good way to look at this would be: ""How many players from the spurs roster would still be in the NBA in 3 seasons? Versus the Warriors roster?""  You can't tell me that a supporting cast of Trey Lyles, Rudy Gay, Mills, White is worse than Damion lee, a washed Bazemore, JTA and Mulder.    Kerr doesn't have  a goal to make a middling push to the playoff - hence this stressful period of trying to get everyone to adapt to the next season's game. Whoever can adapt well will make it to the next season and the rest will be cut."
closing games with damion lee is a fireable offense.
Damion Lee has been fine
You literally can. It's called intentionally fouling. The new flagrant rules are about grabbing over the shoulder. Like what damion Lee did vs Toronto. This was a pretty innocent Intentional foul to force kat to go to the line.
"Hey now, we started 1-2 thanks to a damion Lee gw vs bulls k"
Damion Lee with -36 in 18:00 mins. That's not ide.
lol damion lee -36 on 18 minutes and GTJ +54
"Probably yeah, to the Warriors for Damion Lee + a protected 2nd round pick"
Please let us have this after that Damion Lee game winner last time around.
"I would say he’s like a g league/2 way level player honestly. Nba level athlete and kinda benefits from small ball as a 4/ small ball center. He can’t shoot at all but has decent finishing and cutting. He has good handling for a 4 and especially for a 5 when he’s there. He’s has the body and athleticism to really guard 1-4 and routinely matches up with guards. He’s probably a negative still on defense just because of being jittery as hell and low bbiq. All in all, in the league because of his brother but not far off from belonging at this moment. Him on the minimum for potentially 5 years of Giannis is really worth it. I would compare it to Damion lee in Golden state before I compare it to Dames cousin in Portland lol"
"this is not even the best bench reaction, damion lee and other dude were ducking for cover and shit, was hilarious"
"JTA and Damion Lee were talking shit about the air ball, but they can’t even get garbage time in a blowout?"
is damion lee just not playing? where was he last game?
Have either Dame or Harden had this bad a roster offensively? The Warriors 2nd best player offensively is...Damion Lee?
"Yeah...? Warriors have a great defensive big man and the Nuggets have an average one. That's exactly the point I'm making.  On the perimeter the Nuggets aren't significantly worse than GS. The Warriors give big minutes to guys like Steph, Damion Lee, Moulder, Bazemore, Paschall. All those guys are average at best defensively."
"&gt; This current team would be just as bad as last year  Lolllll it's hilarious how disingenuous you're being instead of making the actual argument that is there for Curry. Sad.      Players that started the most games for you last year:   Glenn Robinson 48 games, Draymond Green 43 games, Willie Cauley Stein 37 games, Damion Lee 36 games, DLO 33 games, Eric Paschall 26 games  DEFINITELY the same team. Andrew Wiggins and Kelly Oubre same as Glenn Robinson and WCS, no?  Not even considering that Draymond Green literally didn't try last year."
Damion Lee is fine
"Would rather meme their whole bench lineup instead. We've got Nico ""Ginger Mamba"" Mannion, Damion ""Nepotism/Splash Step Bro."" Lee, Wannabricker, James ""Big Jim"" Wiseman, and Juan ""Steph's Teammate"" Toscano-Anderson."
"Yeah I keep seeing people say lamelo wouldn't be good for them, but have they watched the Warriors this year?  They have Brad Wanamaker and Damion Lee handling the ball a very worrying amount.  In their situation I'd much rather have another ball handler who is already very good than a center who isn't that good right now but might be good in 2-3 years."
Mannion getting minutes over Damion Lee cool cool cool
Why are Poole and Mannion on the floor at the same time. How hard is it to put in Damion Lee for one of them.
Well you can't reallt compare both teams lol our best shooters after Steph are Wiggins and Damion freaking Lee lmao
"I'm pretty sure this happened to the Dubs last year when Steph broke his hand, DLO twisted his ankle, and Draymond's back began to bark, so we were down to 8 guys and needing 30+ minutes from 2-way Damion Lee."
"Impact metrics like those also have regular anomalies and inaccuracies of their own.  According to RAPTOR his teammates Damion Lee and Kelly Oubre are better defenders than him (anyone who’s watched a Warriors game would laugh at this), and PJ Tucker, Chris Paul, Middleton, and Siakam are all worse/negative defenders.  The reality is that there are no perfect defensive stats, and they all need more context to be interpreted properly."
"Why do you think his nickname is Damion ""Nepotism"" Lee?"
"Sydel is babe af, Damion Lee one lucky guy"
"I don't understand why Damion Lee got no minutes in the first half.. like, Poole and Mannion over him?????"
Didn’t damion Lee call luka pussi ass white boi or something like that?
We're just lucky that our fanbase actually likes Damion Lee.
38 percent from three lookin real efficient huh we'll see at the end of the seasonal this is all talk and tbh I'm waiting till we get klay back next year for me to actually dream of curry getting a ring  Cause rn hes doing this all himself     ofcourse klay draws attention from steph cause instead of triple teams he gets double teams which is easily better then a triple teams   coaching isnt the problem ur player has feet move not every steph off ball play is written up steph never stops moving even when hes not in the play it's a work ethic issue and it's nothing against dame but everything for curry Cause it's normal for all stars to take breaks during plays    the blazers are full of 3pt shooters the warriors got Michal mulder Jaun toscana and Damion Lee as the best shooters next to steph
"Let’s wait 10 years. We will look back and it’s gonna be like how was that team 36-26 when Curry played.   Draymond - good on offense bc of fit with Curry and high IQ/good facilitating.   Wiggins - Legit good most of season.   Oubre - Makes the team worse despite being a rotational player in NBA. Tunnel vision ball hog was playing a lot for political reasons and eventually got benched for Kent fucking bazmore   Looney- Great defender, high IQ but can’t score. Knows how to play with Steph.   JTA- two way guy, has improved a lot and most of what makes him good is being one of the smartest players on the team who knows to look for Steph. Good low volume three point shooter this year   Poole- was literally in the G-League early in the year , improved a lot tho still streaky shooter and pretty bad his rookie year.   Mulder- only a shooter, left wide open all the time and still misses a bunch.   Bazemore- decent rotation player, 9th or 10th man on a good team.   Paschal- can score one on one vs slow footed centers but got hurt and then started to suck and got benched before injury that kept him out.   Wanamaker- lol   Damion Lee- decent player,  10th man on a good team.   Smiley and Nico - not nba players    When we look back on this team a lot of these guys will be looked at similar to Kobe’s team that year"
They had him on a Damion Lee type partial guarantee but decided to give his roster spot to Mulder instead.
"Very intereseting. I think he has some clear limitations but the Warriors are really missing guard depth and a plug and play perimeter defender would be huge for the Warriors in the post season.   Now that Wiseman (and to a lesser extent Oubre) are out of the lineup we're really seeing what this team could have been all season. But they are massively lacking depth. Legit 8 man rotation for weeks now.   Eric Paschall is reportedly very close to coming back, Jordan Bell is getting signed to a two way and will be available for the playoffs, but Damion Lee sounds far away after contracting COVID and Oubre is a complete question mark.   None of these guys will likely play a ton of minutes in the post season but just have the big man depth and a little extra depth at guard is a big deal for this team."
"I think the team would have loved for him to accept a Damion Lee type ""multi-year, only partial guarantees"" type deal but I think his representation probably knows better, he's playing well and if the Warriors have success next season he may command even more money as a free agent versus the minimum offers he'd be likely to field if he entered free agency this off season."
"Without Oubre, Damion Lee, and Mulder being a complete negative asset.  What a fucking win."
"&gt; I'd give the series 60-40 to Warriors with both teams at full strength. Being down two starters is pretty significant. Let's reverse the roles with 2015 Warriors missing Iggy while HOU had Bev+Monti - does that series go past 5/6 in favor of the Rockets?  I’d say Warriors had enough depth for that even in 2015, especially since Monti would be the same or a worse liability on D Terrence Jones or Josh Smith were.  &gt; So what? OKC was a perennial WCF powerhouse that was out of the playoff picture due to injures. 2021 Lakers would love to have the Clippers not be in the playoffs with injuries to Paul George and Kawhi, and for two of Kyrie/KD/Harden be out in a potential finals. But not every run is as easy as 2015.  OKC being a perennial powerhouse in prior years still doesn’t mean they were as good as their 2016 version though. And the 2020 Lakers played an injured Lillard, Westbrook, Bam, and Dragic on their way to a ring. You don’t have to be out to say your injured. It’s not as bad as 2015, but no one puts asterisks on rings because rings are still rings. There are no ‘easy’ runs to rings.   &gt; There is a double-standard regarding takes on Curry's impact - that Curry elevates teams with KD/Klay but is absolved of any shortcomings without them.  What shortcomings do you talk about?  &gt; Curry mutually benefits from Klay/KD, but his fans act like gravity is a one-way street. Now that Klay/KD are not on the team, Curry has a chance to substantiate those absurd gravity claims, but is only scraping by as an 8-seed.  What did you expect the Warriors to be this season? Apart from Dray and Looney, he’s playing with newcomers, a G League cast, and rookies. Expecting them to be a top 4 seed is absurd. Even guys like Kobe wouldn’t drag this team to higher levels. We’ve seen his absolute peak drag a Lakers team as shitty as this one to a 7 seed and that was his absolute max.   &gt; You might say Curry's supporting cast isn't that great. I'm saying it's not as bad as people are describing.   +/- metrics would definitely disagree with you. So would the spacing metrics.  &gt; You might then say Klay will return. I'd then say a rehabbing Klay at 80% of himself isn't going to move the needle toward championship status. So given all this, Curry has a chance the next few years to prove he doesn't need KD. I'm saying he won't even get close to a title.  So basically, you expect the Warriors with one All NBA player in Steph, MAYBE enother one in Klay, and a declining Dray who’s not All NBA anymore, to prove themselves AFTER winning 3 rings? I call bullshit. How often to teams win without at least 2 All NBA caliber guys? There’s Mavs 2011, Spurs 2014, and Pistons 2004 off the top of ny head. That’s 3 teams since the start of 2000, and those were excellently constructed teams. What is with this extremely high bar?  &gt; I already explained why 2015 was another anomaly   Nope, you’re putting asterisks on titles, again. You want to give KD props for his rings, then yes I agree. But keep that same energy. You can’t just call a whole ass championship run an anomaly. There are so many factors that go on a championship run other than just the playoffs? Have you ever thought that maybe being good in the reg. season led to fresh legs for the Warriors in the playoffs? And that decreased their chances of getting injured? Sure their opponents getting injured was unfortunate, but calling their ring anything an anomaly is like saying KD’s rings don’t mean shit. And the thing is, they do.  &gt; Can Curry remain relevant without a stacked team? I'm saying no.  Man was relevant before KD came and relevant is relative. Do you mean relevant by contenders, or by being playoff teams? Because to do that you have to analyze what teams they’re gonna be on. I’m not gonna sit here and think that a team that gives significant minutes to Mychal Mulder and Damion Lee should win a ring. But I’d be shocked if a team with Steph, Klay, and Dray don’t make the playoffs."
"It’s not the literal police… he wasn’t close to being as good as a Steph jumper off a screen or a Gobert P&amp;R, and I’m not sure why we should feel the need to defend hyperbole.    Again, though, that doesn’t really have anything to do with the fact that comparing his iso to team’s isos just doesn’t make any sense to do.  Why do I care if Harden is better than a dataset that includes Jordan Bell and Damion Lee and Quinn Cook?   The comparison just doesn’t make logical sense."
It's a simple as googling Damion Lee covid that's all I'm saying.
"damion lee got the vaccine still got covid, so baze just needs to stop being selfish and get the shot so hes protected...  &amp;#x200B;  makes sense."
Damion Lee had an extended interview about it do you even look shit up before asking questions?
Does his family quaratine? These selfish people could derail the season. Damion lee got covid even after getting the shot and is suffering. Baze could infect others since he is not protected.
"Interesting that offensive rebounding is so much more highly correlated with overall rebounding.  Of their top 25 in total rebounding:  * 22 are among their top 30 in offensive rebounding * 11 are among their top 30 in defensive rebounding  The top 3 in defensive rebounding (Vuc, Baynes, Mozgov) aren't even in the top 30 overall. Weird to see guys like Damion Lee and Joe Harris in the top 20 in defensive rebounding."
Doesn't Damion Lee have Covid? Why is he still attending games?
"He also said he got 2 shots. J&amp;J is not two shots. I definitely don't trust ESPN as a source either. 3.9 million J&amp;J shots nationally in march. Odds of him getting it was beyond unlikely. And I'm pretty sure Kaiser management and staff would have had access and we didn't so ok I'm wrong.  &gt;Damion Lee Golden State Warriors forward Damion Lee received his second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine nearly two months ago.

Damion Lee somehow contracted Covid, even though he is vaccinated, and the only player who had to go through protocols on the team was the aforementioned Bazemore.

Damion Lee
"Mychal Mulder, Wiseman, Damion Lee"
"He’s been coming off the bench for damion Lee and Kent bazemore bruh, that shouldn’t be an issue when Klay comes back. He’s been great as the 6th man still playing a lot of minutes. Hope the dubs keep him"
"If his shooting isn't an outlier this season and he reverts back to his career average... oof that could get ugly even in a bench role.  There was a time when he stitched 499 on his shoes because he was ranked 499 out of 500 players. Tbf, that was after his rookie season with us, but fans from his previous teams will tell you that he hasn't really improved upon his faults (bad defense, low BBIQ, tries to do too much). I think he developed some bad habits being a starter on mediocre teams before falling back down to earth and accepting a bench role recently.  I'd only be okay with him still wearing a Warriors jersey if he's deep into the bench. I actually trust Damion Lee more than I do Bazemore... at least Lee knows his limitations and doesn't try to play outside of his role unless forced to."
Damion Lee
"I mean, the Raptors did it but we had quinn cook out there as the only other shooter. And he didn't do anything with that space anyways.   If Damion Lee and Oubre play, we have 5 guys who can knock down open shots (Lee, Oubre, Wigs, Poole, Bazemore, kinda JTA). Hopefully then the 3v4s actually work out after Steph is doubled"
"The fact that we don’t see way more box and ones is kinda baffling to me.   You just can’t rely on guys like Bazemore, Damion Lee, Mulder to carry this team offensively when Curry is being double teamed."
Damion Lee
Damion Lee coming to us live on NBC Sports from the year 2011.
Damion Lee got the vaccine and is still missing critical games for a shorthanded Warriors team. Do we actually know Schroder didn't get it?
"Currently GS had no depth at all with Oubre, Damion Lee and Paschall out (not to mention Klay and Wiseman out for the season). Wiggins is questionnable, so assuming he doesn't play that's a roster of 7 bodies (plus Nico Mannion and Smailagic but let's not count them honestly).  It will take supernova back-to-back games from Steph to hope winning at least one."
"Actually not too surprised at Damion Lee. People hang on to some clutch time mistakes, but he’s pretty efficient, a sneaky good rebounder and he plays within the offense.  I won’t pretend to know what factors into the catch-all statistics, but Lee has very quietly turned into a reliable contributor."
"I think we need to understand what league average means though, because there's a big different between a starter and a good starter. Only 150 of 450 players in the league are starters.  But yes, -2.0 is the ""replacement level"" in BPM. Interestingly, if you look at VORP (which is obviously based around replacement level) or at RAPTOR (which I think is also), the stats all say the same thing. Steph is at or near the top of the league and the only players with positive offensive value on the Warriors is Draymond (and Damion Lee, weirdly)."
Advanced stats are notoriously bad for defense. Damion Lee is at a +.5 and he's one of the worst defenders on the team.
"Maybe color means something different to them. Like as long as they both have the same colors on them somewhere, it's good. Not just the primary color matches.   Damion Lee breaks his rule every game"
"No independent impact on offense, yeah I agree to an extent. He’s a great passer, but yes, his offense is very dependent on Steph and others.  Defensively though, he more than makes up for his bad offense.  Dray isn’t the problem overall (though his lack of offense IS a problem, it’s far from our worst). Our biggest problem is that no team that wants to go anywhere can have Damion Lee or Mychal Mulder playing 20 minutes a night for them and closing games for them.  We need Klay back, and we may even need to make a big trade if we are ever going to attract competitive vets again, so we can relegate guys like Lee or even Poole to low tier bench roles instead of the first guys out there."
"Besides Wiseman, those other two have been alright (I’ve been a huge Oubre critic, but he’s been great in this bench role).  The bigger problem is replacing Livingston, West, etc. with fucking Damion Lee, Mulder, Poole, or Bazemore lmao."
"I can’t even fault roster construction that much  No FAs wanted to come to a Warriors team with no Klay. We have been to 5 finals in the past 6 years. That’s a recipe for a WOAT bench, and that’s basically what we have.  You can only assemble G-Leaguers in so many ways. We basically HAVE to make a big trade early in the offseason next year, to make a statement and become a destination for competitors again.  No team is doing any damage with Damion Lee as a primary player off the bench. Let alone Bazemore, Poole, or Mulder.  Oubre has been a baller off the bench as of late, and JTA is a diamond in the rough. Everyone else is garbage. Poole is alright sometimes, but way too inconsistent for me to mention him."
Bazemore is Damion Lee with short hair. Change my mind
"Damion Lee was definitely 1, and Fox went into protocols for two weeks too, so probably him"
Damion Lee got COVID despite being vaccinated per his Twitter.
"They lost a game he put up 57 on 61% from the field and 58% from 3 on 19 attempts. Damion Lee, Brad Wannamaker, and Kelly Oubre played like absolute trash, which was enough to lose the game."
Yeah I think so.  Warriors Damion Lee is in the protocol right now and he publicly said he got vaccinated.
"They definitely are great at player development, sure, Steph would have been Steph playing for the Sterling's Clippers, but does he become the change in the NBA in other system? Klay is another lottery pick, but Draymond, Looney, even Patrick McCaw looked like an NBA player in their system before the injury and leaving, they didn't get many picks ever since 2014, but the ones they did they made them work somehow while in their system. Damion Lee and Jordan Poole still have a place in that team, they are not dead weight but probably they have a more prominent role than they would in a fully healthy team."
"&gt; Kat, ayton and jjj was shit on defense on their 1st year  They were not shit on defense. JJJ was a good defender as rookie for one, dude had a positive defensive DBPM, DWS, and net rating. Ayton was also good his rookie year, and although he had a negative DBPM, the rest were positive. KAT had a marginally negative DBPM but rest were positive. Kat was decent defensively as a rookie tbh. His issues on defense have come and gone.  Wiseman's ORtg was 100 and DRtg 110. WOOF. OBPM -4, DBPM -1.4, VORP -.7, OWS -.4. His only positive was a 1.1 DWS, so kudos to him for that. But his DBPM was 2nd worst on GSW, and his DWS was behind Dray, Wiggins, Oubre, Curry, Basemore, and Damion Lee. So I think that explains that.  In comparison, Ayton led the Suns in DWS as a rookie, 4th in BPM, and 2nd in VORP. KAT also led his team in VORP, DWS, and BPM. He and Ayton had mediocre DBPM on their teams because their teams were the worst defenses in the league. JJJ had 107 DRtg and 108 ORtg, 3rd highest DWS on his team (2.2), 3rd highest WS, 1 DBPM, tied 4th highest VORP at .7. They were a top 10 defense too.  GSW is a good defense where Wiseman looks bad by stats, that's saying something as a center. His negatives are huge in the stats, and imo eye test made him look worse."
he’s washed tbh. blazers should trade him to us for damion lee
Damion Lee
Damion Lee and Kent Bazemore were out with Covid and they get 20+ minutes a night. And then they were missing their other two centers. Right now it’s just Looney and Draymond.
"They’re down JTA, Damion Lee, and Bazemore as well"
Damion Lee and Kent are also solid role players.  But yeah not a murderers row.
"Gentle reminder that the Warriors are missing: Klay Thompson, Marquese Chriss, James Wiseman, Eric Paschall, Kent Bazemore and Damion Lee."
"Warriors started Mychal Mulder because the preferred choices of Damion Lee and Kent Bazemore were out.   Lol, okay."
"Warriors had a lot of key injuries too. A lot of their rotation is out- Bazemore, Damion Lee, Wiseman.   Not to mention Klay who everyone omits when they talk about players being out."
"Yeah he should give Wiggins, Draymond, and Damion Lee more looks"
"It's not just missed layups... in general it's been execution in the clutch. It's not hard to see why when most of the team is either super inexperienced or just joined the team in the last 2 years (or both). If you told me 5 years ago that'd we'd be relying on Wiggins trying to finish a layup to tie the game from a pass byKent Bazemore, I'd be perplexed/confused. Or that Damion Lee would be taking the final shot (or supposed to, at least) more than once a season. Or that starters would be missing clutch free throws (the anti-Iggy).  Now Dray, his offense has always been on pretty shaky grounds, so I wouldn't be that surprised with the results. But I'd be surprised he was being put in that position so often. Steph is the only clutch player the team can rely on this season, so when he has an off game, things really boil down to a coin toss. Seems about right that we're a 0.500 team this season. You hate to see it, but at the same time it makes so much sense."
Damion Lee so good he's the best player in games he doesn't play in
"Warriors bench is actually doing pretty well right now. The problem with the bench is there is no consistent rotation at all. Sometimes it features Oubre, sometimes Wiggins. Sometimes Nico, sometimes Damion Lee. JTA will get a start one day then DNP CD another. Wiseman will get a bunch of bench minutes in the first half then none in the second. Same with Paschall. Jordan Poole has been a consistent 6th man since February, but that's pretty much the only player who's been consistently in the bench rotation."
"Last year your top 5 in minutes played was Eric Paschall, Glenn Robinson, Damion Lee, Alec Burkes, and Jordan Poole   This year it is Andrew Wiggins, Steph Curry, Kelly Oubre, Draymond Green, and Damion Lee"
"4 of those free throws were intentional fouls and 1 was a foul on damion lee before the ball was inbounded so he really only got 7 off of actual basketball plays, none of which he was flopping for?"
"I was really impressed with the warriors defense on joel last night. Just solid, clean 1 on 1 play by draymond and looney and the doubles just neutralized him. Fugging damion lee got a block on him lol. Obviously easier to game plan against with no ben and tobi but they really took him out of the game as much as you reasonably can.  On the other hand the 76ers had no answer for curry (once again no ben hurt). Classic example of Currys endurance just breaking a team down, they simply couldn't keep up with him and then he refused to miss with barely any room. I am not a fan of his foul baiting but at least he still drains them when he's going for it."
"And Steph is doing that with bazemore, Damion Lee Gary Payton II and smiley"
Damion lee flops too much.
can someone confirm if damion lee is married to the curry bros sister?
Well not necessarily Dwyane wide might still be better than the current worst NBA player.   Joe Johnson is probably better than Damion Lee   I understand what your saying though
"Wiseman wasn't good pre injury, in fact he was awful. Other guy is right ab Dray, he's a facilitator but it's not that helpful with nobody else. Wiggins is a good rotational piece, not the second focal point on offense (which he is rn, after Steph). Oubre is competent that's literally it, Looney kinda too but it's not like he creates offense (although Oubre only creates badly lmao) and he's been hurt a lot of the year. Our third or fourth best player might seriously be Jordan Poole, who's a happy surprise this year he's gonna be great in the future. After that it's barely NBA players, I mean we're getting a lot of minutes from: Juan Toscano-Anderson (love him tho), Bazemore, Mannion, formerly Wanamaker, Mulder, Damion Lee. I'm talking more offensively than defensively but seriously scroll through our roster on the warriors site.  I think you have a slightly inflated view of Oubre, Looney, and Wiggins + Looney has been hurt, and a very inflated view of Wiseman. Also after those guys, Dray, and Poole, literally everyone sucks and the only ones who kinda show promise are Poole and Paschall and even the latter is kinda doubtful to me."
"Luckily he’s getting Klay back next year.  I don’t give a fuck, 50% of Klay Thompson on a damn wheelchair is better than giving Baze and Damion Lee clutch minutes."
Gotta recruit overseas. These low end scrubs on our roster aren’t cutting it. Let’s get some good players from Europe and other leagues and sign them to contracts. I’m sick of guys like Damion Lee and Baze just giving games away after masterful performances from Curry.
"Damion Lee hit that nice game winner tho (was that this season, I don't even know anymore) but other than that he's nepotism at its finest"
Kent Foulmore. He's a liability to the team. Him and Damion Lee.
Is Damion Lee the best nepotism hire player in the league?
"LeBron would kill for having the DPOY Draymond, future DPOY Wiggins, future 2x ROY Wiseman, future dominating center Kevon Looney, future top 10 3pt shooter ever Oubre, not to mention Damion Lee and Kent Bazemore. That’s an all-time supporting cast and Curry somehow holding them back, even trying to commit suicide on Houston’s stairway and still choked on that one"
"1. Stephen Curry: Literally the reason I got into basketball was Curry during the 2014-15 run. Then at the beginning of 2015-16 I became a massive fan of the Warriors solely cuz of Curry. I still watch almost every Warriors game cuz of Curry, and he is the reason I care about basketball tbh. Watching the 35 ft game winner live is one of my most cherished memories, I literally ran throughout my house screaming for a minute straight when it went in. 2. Kobe Bryant: My dad used to be a Laker fan back in the Magic era and until basically they sucked (not his fault he stopped watching, my mom refused to watch the Lakers get trashed often at some point lol). I could only watch him near the end of the his career, but he was my favorite player back when I didn't know much about basketball. 3. Klay Thompson: I will never forget Game 6 vs OKC, that was one of the greatest performances in NBA history imo. He is the quintissential 3 point shooter imo, his three point shot is the most perfect form I have ever seen. 4. Damian Lillard: Dame is very similar to Curry in play-style. I just love his ""Logo Lillard"" shots and overall clutch-ness. 5. Zach Lavine: Between his athleticism and his shooting, his game is so asthetically pleasing to me. I really hope he and Vuc have a fruitful career together in Chicago and maybe even win a ring, two of my fav players in the league rn. 6. Kyrie Irving: Off the court he is pretty stupid, but his game is super asthetically pleasing imo. His handles are literally insane, I love when he fakes defenders really badly. 7. Ja Morant: His athleticism is INSANE!!! I hope he develops a 3 point shot to improve. 8. Nikola Vučević: Overall as you can probably tell from this list, I'm not a big fan of most forwards/centers. I like Vucevic because he doesn't just play bully ball and flop around in the post like a lot of other players, his game is so smooth imo. 9. Lamelo Ball: The flashiness! His passing is so cool, I hope he blossoms into a superstar. 10. Kemba Walker: I always loved Kemba with the Hornets. I know he wasn't ever particularly efficient, but to me his game is pretty asthetically pleasing as well.  HM: De'Aaron Fox, CJ McCollum, Kevin Durant, Vince Carter, Damion Lee, Kent Bazemore, Donovan Mitchell, Tony Parker, Pau Gasol, Rajon Rondo, David West, Wilt Chamberlain (or the idea of him, I obv didn't watch him play but the mystery about him is so interesting to me. Also I think he would literally be a god-level player in today's league)  So overall, I love shooters and explosive guards more than any other types of players. I'd love to discuss this more to, if you have any questions feel free to ask!"
"Damion Lee was destroyed by Covid, and he was vaccinated."
"Which means it is likely a false positive and he won't miss much time. It happened to Kevon Looney this season. He only missed one of two games.  Otherwise he is line Damion Lee, who got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine with many other Warriors players but still got sick and in his case had a pretty bad case."
&gt;I mean if he’s vaccinated then he should be okay and able to play in the WCF.  damion lee missed at least a month..

Damion Lee??!? C'mon man just delete your account and take this L
Damion Lee was out for two weeks
Damion Lee claimed to be fully vaccinated and was sick
"Damion Lee got the J&amp;J vaccine and tested positive, apparently had symptoms as well, though pretty minor it sounds like."
Damion Lee got Covid after the vaccine (with pretty bad symptoms from what I hear) and was out for close to a month.
Damion Lee got COVID despite being vaccinated and missed a bunch of time.
If Chris Paul got vaccinated in one go that means he got the J&amp;J vaccine which is less effective than Pfizer or Moderna by 20%.  Damion Lee received the same vaccine and missed multiple weeks after contracting Covid despite being vaccinated.
Damion Lee was vaccinated and got completely wiped out by Covid. Missed the last month or so of the season.
Damion Lee did get super sick despite being vaccinated and missed more than just 2 weeks because of how bad he felt. It’s more rare and I’m not saying Chris Paul will but it is still possible for young vaccinated athletes to get it bad
"Thanks for the info. I remember other players getting COVID after the first shot, or before the two week inoculation period was fully up after the second. I didn’t know about Damion Lee. Just looked it up and he had the J&amp;J vaccine, so he only had one shot total.   It does depend on the vaccine the players get too. J&amp;J is faster to get vaccinated, but it’s not quite as effective. Still absolutely worth getting though.   My bigger point is more, “why would CP3’s media team let people assume he’s not vaccinated if he actually is?” It’s certainly possible, but CP3 should probably look into a new media team if that’s the case. There wouldn’t be any reason for them not to get out in front of this, and tell everyone he’s fully vaccinated (unless he wasn’t obviously). Keeping quiet is just gonna keep the rumors churning."
Idk about the coaches and stuff but Damion Lee was fully vaccinated when he got COVID. No doubt the most likely scenario is that CP3 wasn’t vaccinated. My point was just that calling a 5% chance “extremely rare” isn’t really accurate. It’s approximately the same odds of rolling an 11 with a pair of dice. Sure if you only roll once yeah most likely not gonna happen. But if you roll it 300 times…
"Damion Lee is the only recorded case of this. So NBA player, singular. Not players plural.     You're full of shit again."
"I mean once you get tested for whatever reason even after vaccination, you still have to enter protocol. And then they keep testing you until you get let out of it, usually in the 10-14 day range. Just gotta hope he's asymptomatic and didn't get unlucky like Damion Lee and be ruled out for the season."
Damion Lee was fully vaccinated back in March and tested positive a few months later.  Edit: [here’s the interview](https://youtu.be/74ytRUADJNs)
"Yeah, Damion Lee got super unlucky with a breakout case, and he very quickly Tweeted out his vaccination status to clear things up after he was put in protocol. If CP3 got covid through a breakout case despite being vaccinated, I hope he's asymptomatic and can come back fine (if rusty) after he's cleared.  If he's not vaccinated, well, I wish Cam Payne the best of luck and hope Booker can handle the added pressure as well. No sympathy for CP3 though."
"Damion Lee got the JJ vaccine and contracted Covid almost right away, before even that significantly less effective vaccine was fully working  Not quite the same."
It has happened before. Damion Lee had the shot but still could not play the rest of our season due to a combination of the protocols and the severe side effects he still got.
Still depends. My understanding of the newest variant is that the vaccine isn't nearly as effective at limiting contraction or symptoms compared to the other strains  EDIT: Damion Lee being an example of someone you contracted COVID and developed symptoms that prevented him from returning to the floor despite vaccination
So he got the full damion lee treatment?
Unless he's Damion Lee levels of cursed.
"You can also still get it, extremely rare but possible. Damion Lee missed the entire season ending because of covid and he was vaxed."
"Breakthrough cases aren’t as uncommon as we’d like to think. Several pro athletes got vaccinated and still got covid. Damion Lee on the Warriors, 9 Yankee players got covid after getting the J&amp;J vaccine. Luckily the vaccine prevents sever effects, but that doesn’t mean it’s not transmittable so they should still quarantine."
Ehhh I wouldn't say it's fine it clearly has issues between the blood clots and now between the Yankees outbreak and Damion Lee and we will see with CP3 there are quite a few examples of people with J&amp;J still getting COVID.  It obviously helps prevent the worst outcomes but it has it's flaws.
Tell that to Damion Lee
"If so, he'd announce it, given what people are saying about him now that this news has come out. Golden State's Damion Lee did the same thing when he was diagnosed late in the regular season."
Damion Lee was fully vaxxed and he missed a full two weeks and then had to recover.
"I don’t know how any Warriors fan could watch Mychal Mulder in the play-in tourney, and not desperately miss Damion Lee."
[Damion Lee on the Warriors was fully vaccinated with J&amp;J and was still symptomatic](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31402448/golden-state-warriors-guard-damion-lee-said-got-covid-19-being-fully-vaccinated)
"Yeah, the Damion Lee situation was super, super unlucky. That's why even though I could get J&amp;J faster, I waited until I could get the 2 dose Pfizer, even though they say the best vaccine is the first one you can get."
Damion Lee insisted he got it after being vaccinated
"In the NBA, Damion Lee got it after being fully vaccinated as well. It can happen. The key thing is that the vaccines do however eliminate severe disease that requires hospitalization."
But it's still possible he got a false positive. we have cases of that in the nba already.  * [Damian Lee](https://sports.yahoo.com/golden-state-warriors-damion-lee-tests-positive-coronavirus-covid19-pandemic-after-vaccine-032701485.html)  * [Rick Carlisle](https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nba/mavericks-coach-rick-carlisle-tests-positive-for-covid-19/ar-BB1ffPBF)  * [Steve Clifford](https://twitter.com/intent/like?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1386086153376387073%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnba.nbcsports.com%2F2021%2F04%2F24%2Fmagic-coach-steve-clifford-tests-positive-for-covid-19%2F&amp;tweet_id=1386086153376387073)
"If he's really cursed, though, he could still get pretty sick and be shut down for the rest of the season like with Damion Lee of the Warriors (he got the 1 shot J&amp;J vaccine, btw). He'll still be able to sit on the bench and act as a coach/mentor, but it'll depend on how long it takes him to get over his symptoms and get back into playing shape.  Hopefully that isn't the case."
Damion Lee for the warriors got covid while vaccinated. It happens.
Just wanted to say Damion Lee of the Warriors missed the last games of the season and claimed in Twitter he was vaccinated.   My guess is that didn't happen here but we'll see.
"My god. At this point I did not think covid would sideline players. Unless he didn't get the vaccine, this means he got covid despite being fully vaccinated like Damion Lee of the Warriors did, which he explained was an absolutely miniscule chance. My god is he cursed."
Tbf you can still get COVID even if you’re vaccinated. It happened to Damion Lee if I recall
damion lee got covid after being vaccinated. you have no idea if cp3 is vaccinated.
Damion Lee for the warriors got it while being fully vaxed. I know a lot of the Yankees players and coaches got it earlier this year while also being fully vaccinated.  But I dont know if they had symptoms or not
Damion Lee got J&amp;J vaccine then got COVID and was in relatively bad shape for a while and couldn’t play for a long time
I wonder if he did get vaccinated and kept turning out positive test results. The same thing happens to Damion Lee towards the end of the warriors season and he was out indefinitely.
Damion Lee got it too. But youre not going down indefinitely
The Damion Lee
It's probably not a Damion Lee situation

Happened to Damion Lee earlier in the season. The fortunate thing is that if he’s vaccinated it wouldn’t be a severe case that would risk hospitalization. On the flip side it still does take a lot out of people and he still may need time to get reacclimatized to the court.   It would be truly cursed if he got COVID after having been vaccinated given how rare that is.

I know Damion Lee got it while vaccinated as well this season. He was out for a long time to end the season
"GSW's Damion Lee got vaccinated (J&amp;J) in March and got covid in late May. He even got some of the worse side effects to the point when he came back from protocols, the earliest he was cleared to play was the 1st round of playoffs (if we had made it)"
Happened to Damion Lee already. Symptoms and all after vaccination
Damion Lee had vaccinated but ended up season out. pray for his health.

"The Warriors already have Damion Lee on the team (Sydel's wife, Steph's brother in law). That said, I think Seth wants to pave his own career, and Steph respects that."
"For some reason I thought that they could do that with oubre.       I'm definitely not expecting to somehow get another star but it would be nice to get some decent shooters on the team.       Poole improved a shit ton over this season, Damion Lee played well, and Wiggins is essential for us. Give us a few more shooters &amp; rebounders then we could be a top team again."
"""The fuck you doin' with Damion Lee?"" - Steph"
"Bob Myers and Steve Kerr met with reporters on Monday afternoon, wrapping the just-completed Warriors season. Myers speaks far less regularly than Kerr and isn’t often as forthcoming as he was in this interview. So his answers, leading into this crucial offseason, were the most noteworthy.  It isn’t too difficult to read the planned direction the Warriors intend to take. Myers said he’s “pretty confident” the team will work out a contract extension with Stephen Curry this summer, which will be the formal $215 million max commitment to the next five seasons of Curry’s closing title window.  “When you’re lucky enough to kind of fall into a player like that in my position, you owe it to them to try to win,” said Myers, the president of basketball operations. “Those people don’t come along too often.”  Does that mean a home run swing to maximize next season’s roster, at all costs? No. Because we know, even before the summer market materializes, there will be teams willing to trade bit parts for long-term control of a prospect with the upside of James Wiseman. Think Boston would flip Marcus Smart’s expiring $14 million deal for him? Would Chicago send Thaddeus Young? Would Orlando part with Terrance Ross?  Of course. The decade-long possibility of Wiseman is more valued than a season or two of a steady role player. Smart, Young and Ross are better 2021 NBA players than Wiseman and would presumably nudge next season’s Warriors team closer to the title conversation, barring a huge Wiseman sophomore leap.  But the internal belief within the Warriors is that’d be bad business — selling low on a 20-year-old you drafted second overall seven months ago before giving his talent a chance to blossom. That’s why Myers delivered this quote when asked about the idea of trading Wiseman for immediate help.  “No,” Myers said. “I think he can help us. I expect him to be on the team next year. We don’t want to trade James Wiseman. I think he’s a tremendous talent and he was put in a position where, again, the guy is taking hopefully all of his lumps early in his career, but I think he can be very helpful to us in the future. I think he can be helpful in the present. We plan on him being on the team. We plan on him helping us.”  It’s naive to read that quote as an iron-clad lock. Remember this soundbite?   Seven months after delivering that quote, Myers did trade D’Angelo Russell in the first season of a four-year deal. But that reroute was only made when a delicious enough deal materialized — Andrew Wiggins plus both of Minnesota’s 2021 draft picks. If the Timberwolves aren’t obsessed with him, who knows when or if Russell is moved.  Myers can’t say it and shouldn’t say it, but of course, the right offer could move him off Wiseman. What if a rebuilding team like the Thunder dangled Shai Gilgeous-Alexander for Wiseman and these two upcoming first-rounders? Or if Houston suggested a Christian Wood center swap to better fit each other’s timelines? We could list 25 other intriguing hypotheticals.  But as of now, the Warriors seem to be operating under the assumption that a can’t-miss deal won’t arrive at their doorstep and are comfortable entering the season with an older Wiseman, who Myers said should be ready for training camp after rehabbing his knee injury this summer.  “We really hope and think that he’ll be available for that,” Myers said.  If the Minnesota pick conveys, it’ll most likely be in the six to eight range. The Warriors’ own pick is almost assuredly going to be 14th overall. Lottery night (June 22) is the first big summer checkpoint. It’ll deliver them a better idea of which prospects they could possibly draft and give trade partners a better ability to evaluate what type of package the Warriors could offer.  Myers wasn’t dismissive of the idea of adding two more rookies to a roster that already includes Wiseman. But it’s clear, if that’s the path they choose, the Warriors will be searching for more polished players ready to compete immediately. The idea would be to go into the season with Wiseman as the biggest project on the roster.  “I do think young players can help,” Myers said. “It depends on when or how.”  But changes are still coming. Alen Smailagic won’t populate the roster. Gary Payton II, Mychal Mulder and Damion Lee have a tenuous grip on their non-guaranteed spots. The meat of the Warriors rotation needs a boost and Myers made it clear what type of players those have to be, a mandate internally agreed upon by Curry, Draymond Green, Kerr and on up.  “I do know we need veterans,” Myers said. “We have to add some veterans in free agency. We just have to. We’re well aware of that. We’ll try to do it. We actually tried to do it last year with a few guys, so it wasn’t as if that mindset didn’t exist. It doesn’t matter, nobody cares, but we were in second place with quite a few guys that I think could have helped, but they chose to go to a team after Klay (Thompson’s) injury that they thought they could win it more and that’s fair to them.”  Myers even further clarified his free-agent preferences.  “The ones that have kind of done it before, maybe been in playoff series,” Myers said. “Guys that maybe can stretch the floor, maybe a shooting big, maybe a play-making guard. Our defense I think finished fifth. Maybe some more offensive-minded guys."""
"I don't think [Myers](https://theathletic.com/2610671/2021/05/24/bob-myers-on-the-warriors-offseason-veteran-help-needed-no-plan-to-trade-james-wiseman/) would disagree.  &gt; But changes are still coming.

We just have to. We’re well aware of that. We’ll try to do it. We actually tried to do it last year with a few guys, so it wasn’t as if that mindset didn’t exist. It doesn’t matter, nobody cares, but we were in second place with quite a few guys that I think could have helped, but they chose to go to a team after Klay (Thompson’s) injury that they thought they could win it more and that’s fair to them.”"
I feel like Damion Lee deserves to be on this list.
"Try playing with mulder, Toscano and damion  lee"
I was talking about Klay Thompson.....'s teammate Damion Lee
"&gt; Warriors won't be scary,   sure, that's reasonable.  it's also reasonable that we become a 4-5 seed.  &gt; possibly worse than this year   less reasonable. we played mulder in the playoffs. damion lee averaged 20 mpg when he was playing  &gt; because theyd try to give minutes to Klay who won't be able to defend much  WE GAVE 20 MPG TO DAMION LEE."
"Curry simply because of the limited team.  They finished the season with a 8 man roster with 2 of their bench players just coming off /still on 2 way contracts and Jordan Poole. That's it. Lol  Wiseman, Kelly, and Eric got injured. Damion Lee got covid. So for him to make the playoff seeding as the legit 8th seed with Andrew Wiggins and dray as his 2 and 3, he had a hell of a year."
"How did what happened yesterday validate any of your statements? You never mentioned anything about turnovers. If you did, I would've agreed with you that being triple teamed and playing motion offense comes with the risk of turnovers.   Plus, you can easily see they were fatigued from an 8 man rotation for 15~ games with Damion Lee, Oubre, Wiseman, paschall being injured.  You have no idea what you're talking about do ya."
He is forcing himself to stay. He has his friends on the team. Damion lee and bazemore shouldnt be on that team but curry is playing good boi.i hope underarmour looks at how bazemore's presence on the warriors is damaging curry brand and make sure he leaves.  I hate low IQ players and knew bazemore would be a disaster in playoff situations..
"Baze played all those minutes and the team never progressed. They traded him and they started making strides. Honestly bazemore is a cosmetic player.. all activity signifying nothing.. thats what low IQ players are..im a warriors fan and i wrote him off after 2wks,.curry did it to himself though.. he populated the roster with his friends instead of real hoopers. Damion lee and bazemore shouldnt be on this team.. Yes just mulder and jta played but if the roster was good wouldnt the coach play more guys rather than run 8 guys to the ground. Warriors played 8guys in their last 20 games.."
"Gafford is a very good player.. idk abt hutchinson... warriors have damion lee, JTA, mulder, mannion, smiley, GP2, jordan bell.. every single one of those played in the g league.. they have 2 ppg looney. Im certain that if looney leaves the warriors he will be out of the league in 2yrs.. dude im not lying.. bazemore started his career in the g league. Was undrafted and as a 9yr vet he has an IQ of a rookie.."
"Yup. If Mychal Mulder was not going to play much, why not play Damion Lee or Gary Payton II a spell?"
Is Damion Lee available? I'd get him right now for JTA and go for it
The downgrade from Damion Lee to Mulder for GSW these past two games have been huuuge
If the Warriors really thought they could trust their non-Curry guys then why don't they start Poole and even (at a push) Damion Lee?
If it’s an extremely rare case like Damion Lee then nobody would care obviously   Brons not telling anyone if he’s vaccinated so people will assume he isn’t
"Disagree wholeheartedly.  Oubre was really meshing with the squad before the wrist injury.  He was understanding his role and providing quality defense.  That's not to say there weren't legit growing pains for the first half of the season...  It also forced us to give big minutes to someone like Bazemore, Damion Lee, or Mulder.    IMO, the Wiseman talk is also unfair.  He is playing the hardest position in the league with the least amount of experience on a squad that has league worst spacing without consistent practice time due to the pandemic and decreased schedule.  I wish he were a net positive, but it's likely going to take another year to see anything out of him."
"Have you heard of Klay Thompson, James Wiseman, Kelly Oubre, Damion Lee and Marquee Chriss. All hurt this season."
We stand a nonzero chance if we can get Damion Lee and Oubre scoring help soon.  Otherwise we likely lose in 5 or 6.
"Correct, Curry shot 1.5 more attempts this season than 15-16 before Durant was added with Klay taking 17 shots a game that year (and Draymond 10) to Curry's 20.2, this year he took 21.7 with Oubre/Lee/Mulder taking 24 and Dray obviously having his primary role as distributor.    With a healthy Klay, Damion Lee and Mulder are completely out of the rotation, Dray is taking 40% less shots, Steph and Klay sit at different times so ones almost always on the court and nevermind the fact that none of this even matters because Klay would be on a heavy minutes restriction."
"Ariza, Hood, Melo, Gary Trent worse than Damion Lee, JTA, Jordan Poole, Oubre?"
"LOL.   Top 10 in Mins played on Blazers last season: CJ then Dame, Hassan Whiteside, Melo, Anfernee Simons, Gary Trent, Baze, Hezonja, Ariza, Hood  Top 10 in mins played on Warriors this season: Wiggins then Curry, Dray, Oubre, Baze, Looney, JTA, Damion Lee, Jordan Poole, Wiseman  That's Dame with a supporting cast that has a 22ppg guy in CJ, then secondary scoring from Melo, Hood, Whiteside, Ariiza all average &gt;10ppg  This season Curry had only Wiggins, Oubre, Poole, Wiseman average &gt;10ppg  Lillard did a crazy carry last season but still Curry this season has been a few levels ahead."
"&gt;Why has he not played in so long?  Hip Injury  &gt;Why is getting DNP’s?  Hip Injury  &gt;Was he not promising?""  Still is. Hip injury.   &amp;#x200B;  [Article from yesterday:](https://sports.yahoo.com/warriors-lakers-4-key-questions-180143370.html) ""While the Lakers have been dealing with injuries to LeBron James and Anthony Davis, the Warriors have been rolling with an eight-man rotation due to Kelly Oubre Jr., Damion Lee and **Eric Paschall** being sidelined..."""
You talking about Damion ‘Brother in law’ Lee
damion lee
Do we know he didn't?  Damion Lee still got Covid after he was vaccinated.
"Steph/Klay/KD far too good. You can throw in 2 of Livingston, Ian Clark, Casspi, Quinn Cook depending depending on the year for those Warriors teams but for sure the best shooting lineup is the one with the two GOAT shooters  Edit: Can also include Damion Lee as needed for 18/19 warriors"
"below replacement value players that have been through the Warrior's system and been ""serviceable"":  Ian Clark   James Michael McAdoo   Alonzo McKinnie   Damian Jones   Festus Ezeli   Quinn Cook   Patrick McCaw   Damion Lee   Mychal Mulder   Brandon Rush   Justin Holiday    Others who thrive in the Warriors system that may not look as good somewhere else:  Kevon Looney   Shaun Livingston   Juan T."
The organic core of draymond damion Lee and dragan bender should be proud of 15 wins honestly
"Some of the adjustments were due to injuries/covid protocol but:  * playing loon at 5 with Wiseman going out * more smallball lineups with Draymond and JTA * rotating the Oubre starter minutes with combinations of Damion Lee, Bazemore, and Mulder  * Oubre off the bench after his injury * finding a good stagger rotation for the second unit with Wiggs and ultimately Poole stepping up"
"Wiggins contract is for 2 years so he will be here  next year.     Free agents at the end of the season are  Bazemore (Unrestricted)  Looney (Player Option)  Mannion (Restricted)  Kelly Oubre (Un Restricted)     2022: Steph Curry  Damion Lee   Mychal Mulder   Eric Paschal (Restricted)   Off course Curry,  may sign an extension this summer.   And trades could happen"
"Wiseman is one of the worst players I've seen on the court for the Warriors... which makes sense, because he is a raw big man rookie basically straight out of highschool. The Warrior's 4th best player this season (if Curry, Draymond and injured Klay are the first three) has clearly been Wiggins. Past here is where it starts getting very subjective... I would say Looney is our fifth most important player and 6th - 9th are toss ups between JTA, Oubre, Damion Lee, and Poole; 10th would be Bazemore. Everyone else after this point has about the same amount of impact because they wouldn't see much playing time come playoffs, if at all. Especially guys like Smailagic, GPII, and Mannion.  Any Warriors fans wanna chime in, give their thoughts?"
Dude those two games but especially the rockets game was the only thing powering my will to watch the warriors at points last year.  Edit: that suns game and the philly Damion lee game winner right befor it also provided much needed sustenance
"Looney is a good and smart defender. Bazemore can be good but fouls too much.  Damion Lee was becoming serviceable and Jordan Poole has made a big improvement. However JTA is good. He has good fundamentals and is a smart player with a lot of hustle. Oubre I think was underrated defensively this year, especially since he fouled way less than I expected him too, but he’s probably gone so it’s kinda a moot point."
"Damion Lee took 250 fewer shots this year. That’s a massive fucking difference.   And all this hyperbole isn’t helping your point. No matter what you think of the players they added, they were enormously better than what the Warriors were trotting out last year.   It wasn’t just a straight up addition of Curry and boom, we’re winning 20 more games. They added multiple starters, Draymond got to go back to focusing on the things he’s good at instead of desperately trying to cover up holes on both sides of the floor, and the Warriors had a tremendously better roster to fulfill the goals of their system."
"&gt;Draymond missed 20 games last year  He missed 12 games this year, so what's your point? They were also 10-33 when he played last year. He wasn't the difference  &gt;and had a tremendously better big man rotation (Wiseman and Looney)  I can tell you didn't actually watch lol. Wiseman was literally one of the 5 worst players in the league this year. Looney is a decent system player at best who plays less than 20 minutes a game.  Oubre was extremely inefficient and a low IQ ball-stopper on offense.  Damion Lee played ~300 fewer minutes this year than last. Not much of a difference."
"Draymond missed 20 games last year. They started Damion Lee and Willie Cauley Stein for more than half their games last year.   This year they added two other serviceable starters (Wiggins and Oubre), and had a tremendously better big man rotation (Wiseman and Looney).   They added a ton of talent to their roster, even if it wasn’t super high quality talent. They were obviously tanking last season. So to credit Curry with a 30%+ rise in win percentage is disingenuous."
"This is a pretty good move by the Celtics, but it sucks to see him leave.  For those who don't know, Aaron Miles was the HC of the Santa Cruz Warriors from 2017-2019 and Player Development Coach from 2019-21. His Santa Cruz team consisted of Chris Boucher, Kendrick Nunn, Georges Niang, Damion Lee, and Juan Toscano-Anderson. This season, he was mainly credited with the improvement of Juan Toscano-Anderson and Andrew Wiggins"
Hey why not bring up the team option on Damion Lee and Smiley and the player option Loon has?  All about equally relevant in a discussion about Dame Lillard
JTA  Jordan Poole  Damion Lee
"You know who lead the league in scoring?!! Stephen “The Baby-Faced Assassin!” Have you seen the GSW? Steph, Klay, Green (2nd rd), Poole, Paschal (also 2nd rd),Looney, Wiseman all draft picks! That’s 4/5 starters, our #1 bench option (JP) not to mention EP, Nico (who’s tearing it up for Italy) maybe Jessup, all home grown picks! Plus JTA and Damion Lee who we sifted through the G league dirt to find those diamonds in the rough! I would hard pressed to see a team with that much draft capital and that much success! We used to be bottom, bottom shelf! Easily avg 50 losses a year, until we drafted a special lil scrawny light skinned green eyed killer! So here’s the first point I think you missed! You need a corner stone to build your foundation on. Booker could be that guy, but right now it’s CP3. Without him the suns are avg at best. Same with the W’s and no Curry. With Steph, and maybe fortunately unfortunately, we had Nelly at helm and his run and gun offense helped develop Steph’s confidence, but also a lot of losses! After that we moved Monta for Bougut, drafted Klay, Dray and young Harrison Barnes and the rest as they say, is history. And since we are here how many careers have the GSW resurrected? We got David Lee a chip, D. West, Livingston, Iggy, Cousins’, Barbosa, and made KD a god! We take others left over and turn them into a delectable 5 star meal! And while I’m here where’s the love for Kerr? All this Ty Lue talk about his adjustments?!! Really PG13 and Kawaii, last time LBJ and Co. it’s not like his rosters ain’t stacked! Anyways not sure what leading your team in scoring has to do with staying with one team but yeah no one has done it like the Warriors! Next year with a healthy Klay we will be dominant, and reign supreme once again! 😈 muuuhahahajahahhh that’s all carry the hell on!"
"Nets: The big three with prime Blake, DJ, Aldridge, healthy Spencer Dinwiddie, prime Jeff Green, Joe Harris Heat Tyler Johnson, Knicks Shumpert(if not waived), Thunder Andre Roberson(if not waived).

"Hwo do they compare to the original pre-KD finals rosters?  Steph - Steph  Klay - Klay  Wiggins - Barnes  Dray - Dray  Looney - Bogut  Oubre - Iguodala  Wiseman - David Lee  Poole - Livingston  Damion Lee - Barbosa   And they still have Paschall, the #7 and #14 picks in the draft, which could be two of Scottie Barnes, Davion Mitchell, Jalen Johnson, Alperen Sengun, Moses Moody, or James Bouknight.  Also, sign and trades involving Oubre, Wiseman and/or the #7 pick could land them a Porzingis, Siakam, Markannen or another solid piece."
Ngl I had no idea Damion Lee married Steph's little sister. I wonder what the locker room dynamic was like when they started dating haha.
Is that Damion Lee on the loud speaker?
"I sold a Damion Lee card for 1,5k so I am always a fan of Damion Lee."
"I did not realize Damion Lee was married to Steph's sister, that's wild"
"Huh, TIL Damion Lee is related to Doc Rivers."
Bruh I refused to believe that Damion Lee voice
This kid has a deeper voice https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lAHKitHVyU  Damion Lee and Devin Booker need to switch voices
"Our biggest need is more shooting. We don't need Siakam missing a shitload of beyblade spinning midrange 2s. I'd rather bet on Wiseman reaching his potential and the 7th and 14th pick providing the missing depth we're sorely lacking in. Yeah they're rookies but we're also playing Damion Lee and Kent Bazemore heavy minutes right now, so they definitely won't be worse than them."
"If Dell Curry didn't exist, Klay Thompson would be the greatest shooter of all time, Sixers would have been swept by the Hawks. Damion Lee wouldn't have a wife, and Austin Rivers would be the best active basketball player in his family."
"Maybe but doubtful right now. He couldn't even secure a roster spot over guys like Mychal Mulder, Damion Lee or Jordan Poole. For the Play-In round, they chose Gary Payton III, Smailagic and JORDAN FUCKING BELL over having Mannion on the bench.   He does seem to have great poise when he  was on the court though but its always been with/against scrubs. I feel like he's trying to play ""right"" and not make mistakes, instead of showing out so not really sure what is special about him yet. I hope I'm proven wrong though and he breaks out next season since GS really needs a solid backup PG for the second unit"
"They've got an older, but more grizzled Core Three of Steph, Klay and Dray. Health will always be a factor.   Wiseman and Looney manning the middle instead of Bogut.   Oubre and Wiggins on the wings compared to Harrison Barnes/KD.  Iguodala, Livingston and Barbosa's veteran leadership and savvy play will be a big difference, but you have the Core Three taking lver that mantle. They have younger players who are high picks and gained experience the past couple years in Jordan Poole, Toscano-Anderson, Paschall, Damion Lee, Nico Mannion and now the #7 and #14 picks.   They've somehow restocked and retooled while tanking for picks. Don't see why they shouldn't be a top 5 favorite for the title if not top 3."
"[Warriors guard damion lee got it a month after being vaccinated and missed hte last month of the season](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31402448/golden-state-warriors-guard-damion-lee-said-got-covid-19-being-fully-vaccinated)  &gt;Lee, who hasn't played since April 19, said he received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, which requires only one dose, on March 22. He tested positive for COVID-19 on April 21 and experienced a variety of symptoms.  &gt;""I had headache, chills, sneezing, congestion, soreness, body aches,"" Lee said while reading a list off his phone to keep track of everything he dealt with. ""It felt like I was hit by a car. Like hit by two cars at once every step I took. It hurt, it was pain, soreness. It felt like there was a weight on my chest for a couple of days, like it was just hard to breathe."""
Damion Lee of the Warriors got COVID after getting vaccinated (Johnson &amp; Johnson) and he said he had several pretty severe symptoms. I think it kept him out a month.  https://youtu.be/u0mNASUd5E0
"Lamelo and Draymond passing the ball to each other while Steph runs around trying to get open isn't winning you shit.     Lamelo passing to Mulder, Damion Lee, Looney ain't winning you shit either.  Those are the positions they need to improve."
"No, he's not worth the contract you guys gave him. But between the choices of having him and not having him, I'd rather have him  That being said, he's averaged his highest TS (57%), highest eFG% (54%), highest 3p (38%) he's ever had. He also has career highs in WS/48, VORP, DPBM, and VORP. As for his on/off numbers, Kerr usually has him playing with the bench unit, so he gets to play with fringe NBA players Mychal Mulder and Damion Lee  Is he a superstar? Nope, never will be. He's a high level role player at best. But I've been very pleased with his performance with us and have nothing bad to say about him. As long as owners are willing to pay, why should I care about his contract?"
"https://twitter.com/azcsports/status/1407483539466096640?s=19  i'd say ""wait for corroborating news"" but I'm not sure this is the sort of thing that they're going to admit for a while when ""in covid protocols"" covers things.  damion lee went for a really long time without his official status changing, it felt like much later that it came out that he had tons of symptoms.  CP is more important to this suns team than lee but i don't know if that means they'll be more transparent about him."
"Not necessarily... Damion Lee had been vaccinated with the J&amp;J vaccine for IIRC 3 weeks before he exhibited symptoms, which then became bad enough that he looked like a walking corpse when he got out of quarantine so even though he was cleared to play by the league, he never saw the court again the rest of the season.  Just because the chances are minuscule doesn't mean that 2 NBA players could be the victims of breakout cases after being fully vaccinated."
Damion Lee got vaccinated and he was one of the ones who got really sick.
Damion Lee got vaccinated and he got really sick. It took him out a bunch of games at the end of the season including the play-in games.
"Fun fact - you can make a great ""Undrafted Team"" from the 2016 draft:   **PG:** Fred VanVleet, Yogi Ferrell, Ryan Arcidiacono.  **SG:** Alex Caruso, Bryn Forbes, Damion Lee.  **SF:** Danuel House Jr, Derrick Jones Jr.  **PF:** Dorian Finney-Smith, David Nwaba.  Except for **C**, where there's just Marshall Plumlee lol."
IIRC Damion Lee got the J&amp;J vaccine which isn't as effective.
"i was talking to my friend who’s a warriors fan and told him i assumed CP3 would be back next game since he’s vaccinated but he told me that damion lee was vaxxed and got covid and was out for a month, so idk, could be a series without both of them for another few games"
"This Warriors ownership and front office *really* want to be the next Spurs.   That means developing the next batch of talent while you still got your current but aging core.   I know Wiseman wasn't great his rookie year but he showed lots of potential, Poole is looking like he's a year away from winning a 6MOY award, and the Warriors have two cracks at lotto picks in this draft.   They've developed some bench talent, guys like Poole of course, but Damion Lee gave good bench minutes, Bazemore (who will almost certainly be back) gave good minutes off the bench despite some of his frustrating fouling/turn over tendencies, Mulder's not great but he's another shooter, can defend a little better than first thought, and has continuity with the team.   Juan Tuscano Anderson has been a great find, very hard nosed, tough, plays good defense and has out of nowhere this season decided he can hit open 3's.   I hope they can bring back Oubre, Jessup will get a chance to prove he deserves a roster spot during summer league, but a couple other guys should be off the roster.   When I look at the roster the Warriors might be fielding next season:  Stephen Curry  Klay Thompson  Andrew Wiggins  Draymond Green  Kevon Looney  Jordan Poole  Kelly Oubre (maybe)  Juan Toscano-Anderson  Damion Lee  Michael Mulder   a couple lottery picks  1 or 2 ring chasing veterans  I feel like that's a roster that can compete for a title with any team I've watched play in this year's playoffs."
What do you call the relationship between damion lee and austin rivers?
It's actually Seth Curry this year and um...... Damion Lee next year
There have been vaccinated athletes who have missed over a week. Damion Lee for sure and I think a couple of those Yankee players.
I'm hoping he doesn't play poorly from recovering. I know he's vaccinated so it shouldn't be too bad but not being able to play might make him rusty coming back. But apparently Damion Lee said he still had symptoms so that worries me.
"Depends if he actually has symptoms like Damion Lee. If he does he may be out for the playoffs. If not, should be ok"
Damion Lee brother in law
"This is so cool. I had no idea damion and curry were tight knit like this. As a Portland fan I still love watching GSW and root hard for Lee cuz he seem like such a good dude. I remember a game where steph came back from his injury, season already lost but Lee was playing his heart out and missed a game winning 3. Dude was devastated and in tears meanwhile steph just laughing having fun. Another game I remember was when toscano went for a loose ball and dove over the announcers table and was out for a concussion or some thing. Lee was first dude over there and only teammate walking with toscano to the locker room. Just a really good dude. Happy for him"
Damion Lee just secured a long contract from the Warriors
"Considering how good Damion Lee is, it is gonna be Sy-Lee Curry."
Damion Lee is working on that with Sydel
"It's not even really a defensive sacrifice either. Klay returning from injury is likely a better defender than damion Lee still, who has had 2 ACL injuries in his career. Obviously he'll be worse defensively than when oubre was starting but that was such a disaster offensively that I think any reasonable shooter could improve the offense drastically compared to oubre, nevermind a 40%+ 3pt shooter."
"I feel like you glossed over a lot of what I said...  &gt; D Lee gave us 6 points per game.       You can't just pull up basketball-reference, look at D.Lee's 6.5 PPG and 4.8 FGA (when he had 475 minutes with Wanamaker, 452 minutes with Oubre, and 397 with Paschall) and extrapolate that to how much he'll score or shoot in different lineups.  You have to look at how he performed in the specific lineups you're analyzing.  And even then, what really matters isn't how each individual player performs in the lineup. What matters is how the lineup as a whole performs.    Because it's not about how many   &gt;Explain how that is helpful in a lineup when Looney and Draymond won't be attempting FG's either.  &gt;If you're saying having only curry and Wiggins attempt FGs is the way to win games, then please explain that also   I feel like we have a fundamental disagreement when it comes to shot selection. In my mind I would rather have Lee than Oubre or Bazemore. Lee won’t siphon shots away from more deserving shooters, and he won’t take unnecessary risks (whether it be with missing a shot or turning the ball over). If he’s open, he’ll shoot it. If he a defender closes out hard on him, he’ll drive and if he’s got a good look he’ll take a floater, which he’s likely to make (since he shoots them at 61.2%). If not, he’ll swing the ball and force defenses to rotate again.  Now, to the point about Looney and Draymond, I partially agree. If you looked at the chart I had in my previous comment you'll notice that Poole actually performed better with Looney than Lee did. Like I said, I think it's very likely that Poole and Wiggins get a good chunk of the SG minutes in addition to Lee. But that's fine. That shouldn't be a knock against Lee. He’s a solid bench player who knows his role, which is to take open shots, move the ball, attack the occasional closeout, and work hard on the defensive end.   Him having to get more minutes than preferred until Klay comes back is a necessary evil but it's not going to break the team. Damion Lee is not where fans should be placing worry at the moment."
"&gt; D Lee only attempted 5 FG's per game.  If he's attempting more than 5 that's a problem. It's not a good argument when Wiggins and Oubre took 13-15 attempts a game with 30 minutes of playing time, Lee takes 5 attempts on 20 minutes as a role player. Poole took 9.3 and Paschall the biggest ballhog of the team took only 7.5. Draymond and Bazemore took 6.   Damion Lee also had a TS% of 63.6%, which is fantastic for what we're paying him. The net ratings have shown he is a net positive player."
Damion Lee consistently has one of the top net ratings on the team for the last two seasons and that's at least one season without spending much time with the starters. He knows how to flop on defense to make up for his shortcomings and makes a decent clip of 3s.
"I'll reply to [both](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/p5qwwq/steve_kerr_i_think_this_years_team_will_offer_a/h983hh1/) of your comments here.  &gt;  It's easy to boost your net rating by playing alongside good players.  You're right. Which is why I compared Lee to Oubre and Bazemore in the same 5-man lineups (i.e. Curry+Wiggins+Green+Looney+?, Curry+Wiggins+Green+Wiseman+?, and Curry+Wiggins+Green+JTA+?). Those lineups with Lee playing SG shot better and had a higher NETRTG than the same lineups with either Oubre or Bazemore.  &gt;That TS% does not excite me due to him not shooting that much, and that's because he's afraid to imo.  I don't think he's afraid to.  https://youtu.be/vxZ-XOA7auM  https://youtu.be/HKPtA3lLpZo  &gt;Also, last year (in a year Steph was getting triple-teamed and we needed alternatives to make a play or score) D Lee only attempted 5 FG's per game. He had every opportunity to play better, he's just not very good.  Well, technically you should be looking at per-36 or per-100 to compare.  You your point though, you're right: Lee's 11.8 FGA-per-100 was less than Oubre's 19.7 or Bazemore's 13.6. Granted, that includes stats accumulated during non-Curry+Wiggins+Green lineups as well  With that said, I would argue that Lee's 8.4 3PA-per-100 at 39.7% is more important to spacing the floor than Oubre's 7.8 3PA-per-100 at 31.6% or Bazemore's 6.4 3PA-per-100 at 40.8%  Case in point, despite putting up significantly more FGA we saw how sub-optimal the starting unit was with Oubre.  &gt;Dude takes about 1 shot per quarter. That's not how you beat teams when Steph is getting triple-teamed. Especially when Draymond isn't going to shoot, Looney isn't going to shoot, now that lineup you referenced has 3 PLAYERS WHO REFUSE TO ATTEMPT A FIELD GOAL.   If 3.5 of those 4.8 are 3PA then yes, that is how you beat teams when Steph is getting triple-teamed. You don't need him chucking junk up there.   SG	|	5th	|	FGA	|	3PA	|	FTA	|	OFFRTG	|	DEFRTG	|	NETRTG	|	TS% ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- Lee	|	JTA	|	87.9	|	39.4	|	27.3	|	139.4	|	77.4	|	62	|	69.8 Lee	|	Looney	|	84.2	|	47.4	|	21.1	|	147.4	|	105	|	42.4	|	78.8 Lee	|	Wiseman	|	75	|	40.6	|	37.5	|	153.1	|	126.7	|	26.5	|	83.7 Oubre	|	JTA	|	81.3	|	33.3	|	23.5	|	118.3	|	108.4	|	9.9	|	64.5 Bazemore	|	Looney	|	88.7	|	40	|	13.4	|	116	|	106.7	|	9.3	|	61.3 Oubre	|	Looney	|	86.9	|	37.3	|	19.1	|	114.1	|	105.1	|	9	|	59.9 Bazemore	|	JTA	|	75.4	|	34.7	|	21.6	|	107.2	|	105.5	|	1.7	|	63.1 Bazemore	|	Wiseman	|	87.7	|	31.1	|	17.9	|	105.7	|	111.8	|	-6.2	|	55.2 Oubre	|	Wiseman	|	81.8	|	29.9	|	17.6	|	96.9	|	109.7	|	-12.8	|	54.1  FGA may go down but if 3PA and FTA and TS% go up you're going to win. Damion Lee is fine filling in for Klay until he gets back.  &gt;My feeling is Porter Jr, Iggy, or one of the rooks will easily steal that spot from D Lee.  Iguodala is 37 years old. He will not be playing starter or even consistent/planned rotation minutes. Confirmed by Kerr.  Now, sure, OPJ could give you minutes off the bench at the 2 but I think it's much more likely he plays minutes off the bench at the 3 behind Wiggins. Especially because I don't see him getting 20+ minutes a night due to his injury history.  TBH, I actually expect Poole to ""start"" at SG and Lee to come off the bench and play with the starters until they sit and Poole comes in for Steph. But who knows how Kerr works it out."
"&gt; Damian Lee survived somehow, but they really shouldn't get meaningful minutes moving forward.  Damion Lee was fine. Small sample size obviously, due to Lee getting COVID, but Curry+Wiggins+Draymond+Looney/Wiseman/JTA with Lee had a better NETRTG and TS% than the same lineupes with Bazemore or Oubre (even when filtering out garbage time).  Made a few stupid mistakes that cost Warriors a couple games but he's not some scrub. I wouldn't be surprised if Lee gets the bulk of the SG minutes until Klay comes back."

"Oubre is terrible and we were better when he was off the floor, even when we replaced him with g leaguers like Damion Lee and Mychal Mulder. Bazemore is the biggest loss of the offseason imo."
"we'll stand for a little damion lee erasure, not a big deal really"
Damion Lee was on our squad in 2018 as well.
Damion Lee is actually a solid NBA player
It's funny when it works out. It's like Damion Lee for the Warriors. He's solid and knows the system well enough that fans are happy that he's part of the team.
Maybe Steph will put another word in for Damion Lee?
"Tbf, the full quote in The Athletic article is:  &gt; My gut reaction is Jordan Poole. But that’s without having seen anybody at camp, that’s without having seen our rookies or Otto Porter, (Mychal) Mulder, Damion Lee with the rest of the group. It could be any of those guys.  So OPJ is still an option"
"Ah, missed that. That makes a huge difference. Still, as I noted to someone else here, a team with a lineup of Eric Paschall, Glen Robinson 3, Damion Lee, Alec Burks, and rookie Jordan Poole with Draymond playing the 6th most minutes on the team finished 26th in drtg. Doubtful that, with this coaching staff and Draymond healthy, we’d finish last in defensive rating."
"Dray played the 6th most minutes on the team in 2019-2020. Top 5 were: Eric Paschall, Glen Robinson 3, Damion Lee, Alec Burks, and rookie Jordan Poole. THAT TEAM WAS STILL NOT THE WORST DEFENSIVELY IN THE NBA. I don’t know how you could possibly bring up better evidence at how wrong you are. As long as Dray is playing on this team and we have the coaching staff we do, they won’t be last in the league in defensive rating."
"What do you mean by deserves?  Blevins, Damion Lee, Thanasis, Chris Smith... maybe Gelo lol."
"https://youtu.be/x1GxShzVb0k There's countless other examples but it's hard for me to dig up plays from earlier last season.  Two plays this video:  @0:20 he gets the ball, gets open from a pick and roll and doesn't shoot it. Runs to and around the paint. Could have passed to Damion Lee as he draws out damions defender, but instead tries to take an offbalance teardrop with 2 defenders in front of him. Whole play he has no eyes for any of his teammates  @1:03 he gets a pass from curry, probably could have taken a semi-contested 3, but instead drives into a clogged paint to try to take their centre head on.  This isn't just missing shots because he's out of form, it's making stupid decisions and not having eyes for any of his teammates, thinking that if he just drives towards the rim maybe he'll get lucky. Like I said, I remember countless other occasions this happened last season, but it's hard to dig out footage from then, but you can already see his decision making is far from ideal"
"Ahh, the Damion Lee special. Seriously though, Damion Lee took full advantage of his connection and turned himself into a pretty decent player."
"Huh, spent a lot of time in the NBA with people from his childhood. I want to say he went to high school with Damion Lee and Omari Spellman"
"Damion Lee is married to Curry's sister so unless they reeeeally need to get rid of him they won't, shot nearly 40% from 3 last season too and he's going for the 4th season in a row in their system"

"A meh run franchise attracted Kevin Durant, signed David West well below his market value, found great rotation pieces in guys like Looney, Damion Lee and JTA, drafted Eric Paschall and Jordan Poole well below their true value and turned Andrew Wiggins into a great defender...but yeah I guess they suck"
"Andrew Wiggins will be a warrior for the next 10 years and will retire with 3 rings and 1 finals MVP. This is after steph/klay/dray retire and Maple Jordan + Poole/Moody/Kuminga/JTA/Wiseman continue the dynasty. Calling it now.   Unrelated but Damion Lee will continue to receive a salary throughout this era from either the Warriors, the Santa Cruz Warriors, or his brother in law directly. That’s pretty much a guarantee.   Right as that new core is retiring in 15 years a young recruit by the name of Canon Wardell Jack Curry will be drafted by the Warriors and average 21 shots per game from beyond the 4 point line (introduced in the NBA in 2026), thereby carrying the team to yet another series of Championships. Really it’s all fairly obvious.  So yeah definitely don’t write Wiggins off yet."
Damion Lee right?
"Yeah, I wasn't even counting him.  Curry, Klay, Wiggins, Dray, Looney, Poole, Otto, JTA, Wisemanm, Lee, Moody, Kuminga, Bjelica and Eric  That's 14 without Gary, Mulder or Nico. So we can't do Mills, Iggy and Ingles without trading someone (I'd vote Eric) or letting Damion Lee go.  Unless i'm missing something..."
Oh that would be lovely but would that not make it 16 roster spots?... I guess Damion Lee and Payton are non-guarantees right?
&gt;and steph curry’s best friend  Throw some respect on Damion Lee
Warriors could also include Damion Lee (non-guaranteed) to get there.  They'd probably try to sign him again though.
The Clipps also get Damion Lee
"Yea I agree with this take but fucking idiots on the Ws sub (Im a Ws fan) thought we were one Kelly Oubre trade away from being a contender 🙄  We had fucking Damion Lee, Kent Bazemore and Michal Mulder playing clutch minutes in the 4th....   It’s hard to contend when 1/4 if your salary cap is injured for the season"
"“Just the latest to benefit from playing with Steph”, Oubre was on the team last year and his 3 point shot was even worse than his career averages. Draymond hits 3 pointers at a low 20s % clip now. Wiggins clearly put in the work to improve his 3 point shot and deserves credit for that. It’s not like he’s Mychal Mulder or Damion Lee where the defense just isn’t focusing on him and giving him open threes, he was hitting contested/tough ones too last year."
"If Davion Mitchell’s skills translate to the NBA, he is basically a slot in 3 and D guard that could play backup minutes in a playoff rotation.  He would be a huge upgrade over Damion Lee/Mulder/Bazemore who were getting TONS of minutes."
"No, as a warriors' fan, they made the right moves tonight.  Kuminga and Moody was beyond a best case scenario.  I posted this in the warriors sub during the draft, but my big board prior to this draft was:  1) Cunningham  2) Green  3) Mobley  4) Suggs  5) Kuminga  6) Barnes  7) Giddey  8) Moody  You can't do better than getting two of the top eight players that I had at picks #7 and #14.    Do I think the warriors can win a title next year?  No, I don't, unless something completely unforeseen happens at the start of free agency.  What these two picks allow is for the warriors to move on from Kent Bazemore and from Mychal Mulder as regular rotation players.    Right now, you can divide the roster into the ""present"" and the ""future"".  That's part of the dual thread-the-needle team-building strategy they're employing.  The present is:  Steph, Klay, Wiggins, Draymond and Looney  The future is:  Mannion, Poole, Kuminga, Moody, and Wiseman  In the second half of last year, Poole took the jump, and he figures to slide in as the warriors sixth man this year, he's both the future AND very much going to help in the present.  Mannion is playing well in the Olympics, hoping for more development from him.  Wiseman should be a lot better in year two.    Now, besides these two parts of the roster, they have the ""rest"", which right now consists of:   JTA, Damion Lee, Eric Paschall  Paschall can be cut if need be, they'd have to swallow some money, but it's doable.  Ditto Damian Lee.  JTA is the only guy on this tier with significant financial guarantees, and also the best player.    What this means is the warriors have easy room to add at least two free agents next week, three if they can keep Nico Mannion on a two-way deal next season.  The draft is about your future, free agency is about addressing the roster holes you have in the present.    The dubs should go into free agency and see what they can get.  As time goes on, hopefully more and more of the future starts to contribute to the present.    The easiest way for an aging core to get back to title contention quickly is not to trade young players for a star, the easiest path back to the top is to do what the Spurs did: draft another star.  The cost controlled rookie scale contract, as opposed to the big money you'd have to pay an additional star, allow you to fill out your bench with depth.    The warriors won't be title contenders next year, but I think they'll make the moves in free agency to qualify for the playoffs as a top six seed in the west next year (and avoid the play-in tourney).  They can then build on that to take the next step to the top of the mountain again.    If there was a magic bullet trade that would make them title contenders now, they would have made that trade already.  That they haven't indicates there isn't such a trade to be had.  If no such trade exists, the best alternative is to accumulate assets for the point when a such trade does become available.    Kuminga and Moody are excellent assets for that trade, especially since to make such a big time trade will definitely require parting with Wiggins for salary matching reasons.  It would be awful nice to have players ready to step in if and when Wiggins gets dealt, wouldn't it?"
Warriors were a top defense playing dudes like damion lee and james wiseman. I think theyll be fine lol
"It's a little delusional.  JTA is great, pure hustle, and very smart. He's like a less good Alex Caruso. Nico Mannion was literally unplayable outside of garbage time or due to injury. Bazemore is okay. He's a mediocre 8th man off the bench. Damion Lee is Tyrese Gibson/Roman Pearce from Fast &amp; Furious. He's not very good, but he's here cause he's family.  Our bench is not great. Unless you count Looney or Oubre (assuming we force Wiseman to start with Klay/Curry/Wiggins/Dray). Looney is a godsend, any team would be lucky to have him. But he's not anywhere close to a star. Oubre is an athletic headless chicken with hops"
"seems pretty lateral but I think that value is pretty close. you could even argue the Kings demand more compensation for Wiggin's contract. Something between one of their young guns like Damion Lee / Jordan Poole or a future 2nd.  It makes sense why the Warriors would do this (Barnes being a better fit when Klay is back, and obtain a reliable backup PG in Wright), but I don't see why the Kings would. Wiggins is maybe an upgrade and maybe they still believe in his upside.   Not a bad trade though I really think this is value-wise a good trade, just need a reason why the Kings would make a lateral move"
"In the worst-case scenario in which they have to use their picks they can get some really solid bench depth that they're hurting for.   Davion Mitchell at 7 seems solid, especially considering their bench PG is *checks notes* Nico Mannion.  At 14 I'd go for a roleplayer wing - Chris Duarte, Moses Moody or Trey Murphy.   PG: Steph / Davion  SG: Klay / Poole / Damion Lee   SF: Wiggins / #14 / Kent Bazemore  PF: Draymond / Juan Toscano  C: Wiseman / Looney  That's a solid lineup in the West. Obviously it depends on the big 3 playing out of their minds to get deep into the playoffs but the talent is there."
"Ya, Damion Lee"
Damion Lee   Kid can shoot but still lol
GSW although Damion Lee became somewhat usable.
Damion Lee is not horrible
I mean Damion Lee is actually a quality NBA bench player though
"Lol, damion Lee plays in garbage time"
"Added OPJ, Bjelica, Iggy to the bench. Last year they were playing Damion Lee and Mulder near 20 min a game and both those dudes are gleague players. Not to mention 2 lottery picks as well coming off the bench. More time with Wiseman and a healthy Klay coming around new year. This team is gonna be doing a lot better than just the play in spot."
"These SF Chronicle reporters are lazy, fucking Monte Poole. /u/CJleaf explained this twice already.   &gt; Last year Wiggins came out somewhat against the vaccine, as quoted here, whereas Bazemore came out vehemently against it.  &gt;Soon after they both came out against it, Damion Lee, who was vaccinated, ended up contracting the virus, causing Bazemore to be restricted for a week due to covid protocols. Meanwhile Wiggins who was also in close proximity to Lee didn't miss any time at all.  &gt;Before this all happened it was confirmed that if a player on the team contracts covid, as long as you, teammate, were vaccinated and provided a negative test, you no longer had to go through covid protocols.  &gt;So it is a very safe assumption to say that Wiggins ended up getting vaccinated."
"i dont think any of them except Poole will get significant minutes. our 9-man roster at that point is:  Steph / Klay / Wiggins / Dray / Looney  Poole / OPJ / JTA / Bjelica  Even before Klay is back, Poole and OPJ (and even Damion Lee) are all in front of Moody in the rotation."
"Just gonna copy and paste my comment breaking down the Wiggins vaccination situation from two weeks ago where Monte Poole(same dude who here) already tried to put Wiggins on blast for clicks, but yes it does suck he originally said he wasn't gonna take the Vaccine:  &gt; Last year Wiggins came out somewhat against the vaccine, as quoted here, whereas Bazemore came out vehemently against it.  &gt;  &gt; Soon after they both came out against it, Damion Lee, who was vaccinated, ended up contracting the virus, causing Bazemore to be restricted for a week due to covid protocols. Meanwhile Wiggins who was also in close proximity to Lee didn't miss any time at all.  &gt;  &gt; Before this all happened it was confirmed that if a player on the team contracts covid, as long as you, teammate, were vaccinated and provided a negative test, you no longer had to go through covid protocols. &gt;  &gt; So it is a very safe assumption to say that Wiggins ended up getting vaccinated. Not to mention another user pointed out that Wiggins went to Canada to play for the canadian olympic team and there were no issues surrounding his vaccination status.   Monte Poole knows all this given he's one of the biggest Warriors reporters, he's just playing all of this up for those anti-antivax clicks."
"From the Wolves perspective they got off a big albatross contract from a player that was never going to work for them. He's an above average starter who's probably best as a third option on a winning team but he's paid like a true star.   They also got to bring in a player who is very close friends with their franchise guy, KAT, and hopefully make him excited to stay a Timberwolf.   The Warriors had a huge, KD shaped hole on their roster and no way to replace him. In 2020 the Warriors were playing Damion Lee and Alec Burks on the wing and we saw how well that worked out. To flip KD into Wiggins was a huge boon for them as it will hopefully allow them to continue to compete.   Wiggins had his best shooting season last year and this year with even more shooting on the roster his looks should only get better along with having more open lanes for drives and cuts. But if the Warriors don't feel he's working out or they have an opportunity to upgrade his huge contract will become a positive asset in 2022, as it will then be an expiring contract.   And the final piece, the draft pick used to select Kuminga, is all about upside. He's quite athletic and has a high ceiling although he's very young and raw and will likely need some years to develop into whatever level of player he ends up being.   The Wolves on the other hand have drafted Ant, they have a lot of great offensive pieces, they've got pretty much all their own future draft picks, now they just to need to improve defensively and they can be a real playoff team.   Win/win."
"Dang y’all, switch looney for ANY shooter Jesus, and that lineup is fucking amazing. That was supposed to be dray OR looney. Put Mulder or Damion Lee or Otto Porter or bjelica in that lineup, and it’s fucking awesome.   Curry/Klay/Simmons/OPJ/Draymond   Literally as long as Simmons and Dray aren’t playing WITH a center, that’s a playoff caliber lineup. Also, even if they played with a center they could still beat half ghe fucking league. If it came down to the WCF and their core group would be:  Curry/Klay/Simmons/Draymond/OPJ/BJELICA/Kuminga/Looney  That’s a fucking squad"
"One angle i've seen is that if Kerr is going to have Draymond + Looney start anyway, then why not get a massive upgrade over Looney and then just use your other wing options (Otto Porter Jr, Damion Lee) in Wiggins' place. But it sort of ignores the Draymond + Simmons side of things by looking at Simmons vs Wiggins and Simmons vs Looney in a vacuum. (Simmons is definitely better than both in general, but not necessarily for the Warriors current roster situation)  Could argue it's a defensive upgrade since Draymond/Simmons would be a very elite 4/5 defensive combo, but Wiggins also did a nice job guarding the other teams' best players last year in some games. With Klay out for at least 2 months it's a really tough call to take the better overall player for a questionable fit while losing your 2nd scoring option."
I think that year’s Damion Lee would’ve contributed more than him if he got to the playoffs…
"Just gonna copy and paste my comment breaking down the Wiggins vaccination situation, but yes it does suck he originally said he wasn't gonna take the Vaccine:  &gt; Last year Wiggins came out somewhat against the vaccine, as quoted here, whereas Bazemore came out vehemently against it.  &gt;  &gt; Soon after they both came out against it, Damion Lee, who was vaccinated, ended up contracting the virus, causing Bazemore to be restricted for a week due to covid protocols.

Not to mention another user pointed out that Wiggins went to Canada to play for the canadian olympic team and there were no issues surrounding his vaccination status."
"  We need a guard, Poole can play PG but right now we need another body...  Curry, Poole, Moody, ....Kristmas Klay, Damion Lee.  Pickings are slim in FA at both PG and SG, and hopefully we can get someone at the deadline. Payton is fine til then. If Moody is passable we'll be ok til Klay gets back."
"Looney, Wise, Bjelica, Dray and emergency JTA. Ig can play PF.  Otoh...  Curry, Poole, Moody, ....Kristmas Klay, Damion Lee."
"How does one Damion ""Splash Brother-in-Law"" Lee sound? Before you say no, keep in mind that powers are unlocked if he plays with S. Curry on the team  Call now and we'll throw in one mint condition Mychal ""Thompson"" Mulder"
"I think he got it last year because he didn’t miss any games when Damion lee got covid, but Bazemore did."
"Instead of MYCHAL MULDER, KENT BAZEMORE, DAMION LEE, KELLY OUBRE JR., ERIC PASCHAL, brad wannamaker, the Warriors will have KLAY FRICKIN THOMPSON taking the open shot .... Teams will have to keep an eye on Curry for 30+ minutes every night, running around screens whilst Klay will probably be setting those screens. Klay is more than a shooter and knows the Warriors ball movement and knows to pass it for a better shot. However, what's better than a Klay Thompson top of the 3 point line ball screen for Curry to pass the ball to Klay to shoot a couple feet behind the line? Or could give and go to Curry for the easy 3 or drive to the basket, only to open up an open shooter.  Too many possibilities with just Klay on the court with Curry. There's a reason why they were so dominant, those 2 are probably the best 1 2 offensive punch in NBA history. Klay won't need to sprint every minute he's on the court, I expect him to play smart since he's one of the smartest players on the team."
"&gt; Otto porter and bjelica are both elite elite shooters, **and** Poole and damion Lee are large threats from there too."
&gt;and Poole and damion Lee are large threats from there too.
"Poole didn't play half the year because he was in the g league. Damion Lee can shoot but he's not gonna be the difference maker in an offense lol. We didn't even have bjelica or opj last year. It was literally Andrew Wiggins as our sole offensive threat when curry sat for the half season Poole was out, and I'm sure you can imagine how bad that would look as a wolves fan. :)"
"Klay isn't the only shooting threat besides curry. Otto porter and bjelica are both elite elite shooters, and Poole and damion Lee are large threats from there too. They actually have a lot of genuine threats from 3 this year, it seems like the main goal the FO had for this off-season."
"Also if marriages counts then damion lee, doc rivers, Austin rivers"
"The collective Currys, especially if you include in-laws  Dell, Steph, and Seth obviously but then you also have Austin Rivers (sister Callie is married to Seth) and Damion Lee (married to Sydel Curry).   Five people with NBA careers is pretty impressive."
"if you include marriages, the currys include austin rivers and damion lee."
What about Damion Lee?
"Looney, Wise, Bjelica, Dray and emergency JTA. IG can play PF.  Curry, Poole, Moody, ....Kristmas Klay, Damion Lee.  I would rather keep Payton or get another guard than give up the MLE (think trade deadline, buyouts) to a questionable big."
"Yeah, I think he trusts this season's group of teammates more than last season's, especially comparing where they were to start 20/21 to where they are now.  Steph had to carry last season's squad so hard just to earn the play-in 8 seed, and they didn't even clinch a winning record until the final week of the season. This team has won all 8 games (preseason included) it has played together.  A season ago he'd essentially never played with Wiggins, Oubre proved to be a terrible fit, they had a 19-year-old rookie at center, Poole was a non-factor most the season... Now they're bringing actual NBA veterans like Iggy, Porter and Bjelica off the bench and have Damion Lee playing really well.  This team is simply a more Warriors-like team and that allows them to win games when Steph doesn't go off or even look to do so. Klay will fit right in and have a nice long runway to ease back into things."
"I wouldn't have it any other way. Defenses still load up on him, but this season he's got guys who can punish them for it.  OKC did a great job putting a physical defender on Steph at the point of attack and showing him lots of bodies off his screens. He swung the ball around and guys like Damion Lee and Otto Porter Jr made them pay. Wiggins threw in a few isolation baskets as well.   I really enjoyed the game despite the poor shooting by the Warriors early in the game."
I thought he had a great game and yet check the calculator and he averaged only 54.7% TS due to missed free throws and no 3s. That's almost dead last in the NBA for team average TS%. It's the exact opposite of what the Warriors are trying to accomplish.  He needs to learn how to take 65+% on contested drives and stop taking these terrible midrange shots where he is historically 34-36%.  No one should be taking so many of those unless they're KD/ Curry/ Aldridge/ DeRozan/ Kawhi.  Damion Lee is already averaging something like 15 points on 63% TS. And Poole already guaranteed to have a significantly higher ceiling offensively.
The league really let Steph Curry have prime splash brothers in Damion Lee and Jordan Poole
OPJ and Damion Lee the real heroes. But tbh the second unit just defended well.
Damion Lee the real hero
"Wiggins had an above average game and still scored worse than Damion Lee, Splash Brother-In-Law is a steal"
Whoever that still think damion lee is only here because of steph is an idiot.
Damion Lee has been better than poole
Damion Lee playing pretty good this season and he's about to get that daddy bump soon.
"He blatantly scratched Damion Lee (Warriors) in the face last week. Wasn't even going for the ball. DLee had the ball coming up from his dribble so the ball was down low, Lebron reaches into his face and just scratches the shit out of his nose. No one even reviewed it for flagrant either 🤣"
"Least you got to watch the splash brother-in-law, Damion Lee"
we need to play Damion Nepotism Lee less and play our rooks more. it's kind of like the Jimmy G situation. Jimmy Lee is good enough to take minutes away from our rooks but we know that Damion Garropolo will never be anything more than mediocre.
"Warriors at 3-0 have Steph Curry and Damion Lee, so that's 6 wins between the 2 bros and Seth Curry on the Sixers are 2-1. So technically you're wrong because the Curry's have a combined 8 wins."
"It won’t hamper them come playoff time, he’ll either be back or playing the Damion Lee role. Even then, Klay’s injury doesn’t make the Clippers a top 2 team in the West."
"We completely retooled from last year though. Got rid of Baze and Oubre and we got some solid guys who actually work in our system back(Bjeli, OPJ, Iggy). Plus Poole and Damion Lee took a step up. We are a solid playoff team now IMHO where is way better than last year(play-in team)."
"How did Mark Jones say that Damion Lee is Steph's brother-in-law because D Lee married Doc River's daughter (huh?!). Even said her name is now Callie Lee... Earlier he called GPII ""Gary Payton the third."" lol wtf how you have this job and be like that."
"&gt; Especially since he didn’t crack the rotation much last year  And last year's roster was super top heavy. After Curry/Dray/Wiggins, the roster was Looney/Wiseman, Oubre, Bazemore, Damion Lee, Poole, and JTA. If Paschall couldn't consistently crack that 10 man rotation in spite of all the injuries, there was no way he would crack this year's rotation, especially seeing as he'd end up behind Bjelica and Otto Porter Jr. and probably also behind Moody and Kuminga."
Damion Lee. Hate that bum. (No idea why)
"Pound for pound definitely. Since they cut Alfonso ""Dennis Rodman"" McKinnie anyway. I actually think the next best rebounder on this team in terms of skill is Damion Lee or Wiggins"
didn't deserve the W to be honest. Bad game for us. I didn't even bother to stream most of the 2nd half.  Damion Lee has been good these couple of games: guy has a floater and finishes well. Lowkey carried us a little bit in the fourth
PG struggling to beat Damion Lee lol  See how easy it is?
That's why Damion Lee gets minutes
Damion Lee has such a goofy voice lol
I can’t believe Damion lee has a job and I don’t
Damion Lee is awful.
"Nah I feel you man. I'm just trying to be optimistic. I agree he is very raw and that most likely this year won't be the year he will find his potential, but I'm just hoping he at least shows some growth. Yeah true, KD's interior defense was honestly one of the underappreciated sides of his game, and Bogut held it down in the early dynasty years for sure. Still hoping maybe we can add a big sometime down the road but I don't see anyone on the roster that can be expendable right now. Maybe Damion Lee once Moody settles in to his role a bit"
I think by the end of the season Moody is getting 10-15 mpg. Damion Lee is not going to continue getting nearly 30 minutes a night.
"I remember seeing people bagging on Steph last season for not being able to carry the Warriors to the playoffs, but what they conveniently left out (probably because they didn't watch any Warriors games until the play-ins) was that the roster was a hot mess in 2020-2021.  Starters: Curry, Draymond, Wiggins, contract-year Oubre (yikes), half-injured Looney or Wiseman (oof)   Bench: Bazemore (the duality of Baze), Damion Lee, Poole (was decent last year but keeps improving), JTA (has been solid), the other of Looney/Wiseman  Almost G-league: Mychal Mulder (waived though I expect him to find a spot), Eric Paschall (with us now but he needs to prove himself to stay in the NBA long term), Brad Wanamaker (gone, whew), Nico Mannion (in Italy), Alen Smailagic (god he looked terrible), then Mitten/Chriss/Bell (barely played, Chriss because of injury)  They replaced those almost G-leaguers (and Bazemore) with Bjelica, Iggy, OPJ, and two lottery picks. That's quite the reload, especially considering their cap constraints. Going from 7 to 10 rotation-level players is *huge*. Here I am wondering if the Jazz even have 9 rotation-level players after really only having 7 last season (Niang was a liability in the playoffs and Favors was a liability in general). Getting up to 12 with Klay's/Wiseman's returns will give them crazy flexibility and they can weather the annual injuries to Looney/OPJ/Iggy.  Note: Oubre and Wiseman had some utterly abysmal +/- numbers. Some of Oubre's could be explained by playing lineups centered around Wiggins/Oubre but still. Wiseman came in super raw and got destroyed on defense."
"True. If the first game is any indication though, y'all had 10 rotation players (Curry, Poole, Wiggins, Draymond, Looney | Bjelica, Iggy, OPJ, JTA, Damion Lee). Eventually, Klay and Wiseman will also return. Obviously, there's room for Moody and Kuminga to leapfrog some of those guys and any injuries or rest days will lead to some minutes opening up, but it'll be a process. The Mitten is 15th."
"With some minutes from Wiggins, Bjelica, plus OPJ, and Damion Lee, there should be plenty of spacing for the second unit and the blended units we'll see at times. That should create some opportunities to develop Moody, Kuminga, and Wiseman too. This could be a really fun season."
"My buddy and I went to the game, and he saw D. Lee up on the scoreboard and saw Bjelica doing his thing, and asked that same thing, and I was like D. Lee is Damion Lee lol"
"There was a play where Damion Lee realized Russ was on the 3-point line and just sagged off even more.  ""Go ahead Russ, take that"" *Clang*"
"You got me at Damion ""Splash Brother-In Law"" Lee 😂always forget that"
Fuck  especially with the announcer referencing Damion Lee while hes on court I thought they got him on a vet. Min lmao
He said Damion Lee had 3 points
"And it didn't help that he passes to Damion Lee in the first possession, so Harlan said Lee's name out loud."
Damion Lee kept passing him the ball too so Harlan would go “Lee!”   lmao thought i was trippin through time
"Random Thoughts  This game could be summed as Lebron and AD vs. the Warriors.    This Warriors teams reminds me of the 2014-15 squad.    Game was super intense, did not feel like a regular season game at all  Ass tier execution by both teams, so many stupid mistakes, godawful turnovers, and some bafflingly bad decisions by players who quite frankly should know better  Butterfingers, butterfingers everywhere  Both teams bricked a lot of wide open shots, but it seemed to happen more to the Warriors than the Lakers, at least from eyeballing it  Its going to be really interesting with the new rules to see what the refs allow/don’t allow on defense, seemed like the players weren’t really sure either and it led to a decent amount of confusion  Going off that Im getting really tired of teams crashing shooters landing space and refs not calling shit, its a cheap cowardly play, and I thought the NBA got rid of that Bruce Bowen shit, but it seems to be making a resurgence   Move the fucking courtside seats back like 6 fucking feet, there’s no reason in this day and age to have players crashing into fans, its a needless risk to player health  Warriors gutted this game out, really impressive, gutsy win for them, especially considering how well Bron and AD played.  Lakers:  Bron and AD put forth a herculean effort this game, legit hard carried the rest of the Lakers.  WB looked fucking putrid, awful shooting and awful shot selection, clogged the paint/didnt space the court, bad TO’s, bad defense, didn’t create good looks for others, just downright awful in pretty much every regard, I expect WB will get better as the season goes on, but its gonna rough sailing till then.    Melo, and DJ all look cooked rn, if Melo and DJ see significant minutes this year its gonna be uh rough for the Lakers when they’re in.  Rondo and Dwight were both meh, solid uninteresting contributors, didn’t do anything really noteworthy good or bad.  Baze was a surprising positive, no obvious boneheaded plays, good shot selection, good D, big question if he can maintain this level of composure though.  Monk was basically a non factor outside of one made 3, kinda surprised how many minutes he played tbh, left zero imprint on the game.  Kinda surprised they didn’t go to AB earlier, I get he hasn’t gone through practice/walkthroughs but he’s a pro whose played with Bron/AD before, dude should have gotten more minutes.    Lakers offense is painfully bad, it basically devolved into PnR with AD, or swing the ball around until AD, Bron, WB, or Melo iso, which is concerning going forward.  Defense didn’t look much better, and has taken a step back compared to last year, got cut to ribbons multiple times, too many negative defenders on the court.  Lakers D also seems to struggle against stretch bigs, and they currently don’t seem to have an answer for them, i look forward to seeing how they adjust.  Lakers without Bron or AD on the court are fucking bad rn, like there bench is gonna hemorrhage leads, should get better once WB gets his rhythm but until then its gonna be rough.  Once the Lakers get healthier AD really needs to slide the 5, playing him along side DJ/Dwight is just not gonna work longterm, and their spacing is just garbage with two bigs on the court.  Lakers left too many points at the line, free throw drills for everyone tomorrow  Warriors:  Steph had an ugly ugly game, the Lakers played him very physical on the perimeter, and were hard trapping him constantly, basically playoff D in game 1, credit to them,  will be interesting to see how/if the Warriors can adjust in future games, he also created tons of open looks for his teammates, insert gravity memes here  JP is a fucking enigma, dude looked downright awful in the 1st half, almost unplayable, somehow regrouped and had a solid 2nd half, good showing of his mental fortitude, dude definitely has that NBA wiggle too him, D is a work in progress, has too many mental lapses.  Also I swear the harder the shot the higher percentage he shoots, especially near the rim.    Wiggins played not good imo, seemed to struggle on offense since his role is less clearly defined now, had some bad forced takes, ugly TO’s, defense was alright though  Draymond was Dray, good D, solid passing/screens, like his aggressiveness attacking the rim, lots of competitive yelling  Looney looked  his usual self, seems to be moving better, and his passing visions off traps/cuts was much better than last year  Belli looked to fit in seamlessly and played really well, one of the few players making constant good decisions and the Lakers seemed to have no answer for him, also impressed with his handle  Iguodala seems to have found the fucking Fountain of Youth, seriously did not expect him to play this well, especially considering how meh he looked in Miami  Damion Lee played shockingly well, his slashing/finishing seems to have improved significantly compared to previous years  Kinda surprised OPJ didn’t get more run, he looked good in limited minutes  Moody impressed me, really good decision making for a rookie, has a knack for finding the ball, made good passes, played good enough D  This team is small and will struggle against bigger teams, only real hope in that regard is Wiseman coming back and being a neutral contributor  Warriors bench is gonna be good this year, they don’t have the top end talent of serious contenders, but there isn’t a ton of drop off between guys 4-10 on the bench.     BBIQ and passing has improved exponentially compared to last years teams, what a fucking palette cleanser  Last years Warriors team would have rolled over and died in the 2nd quarter, and been down 15-20 at the half, they played like ass but found ways to scratch and claw back into the game, impressive considering how off Steph shot the ball."
Damion Lee is underrated
Damion Lee has matured a lot as a player. Love to see nepotism pay off
I don't wanna see any slander on Damion Lee ever again
Remember when Damion Lee got punched earlier?
 Damion Lee reaction had me dead
"AD is such a baby, he flops onto the floor when 6’2 damion lee touches him"
You cannot put a kid like Damion Lee on Melo lol  That's asking for a bucket
"bruh it's a fucking repeat of last season, the Warriors role players can't hit open shots. I still have 0 faith in Damion Lee"
Is it just me or Bjelica looks like David Lee? I checked the box score when I saw him and it said D. Lee but I clicked and it was Damion Lee.
Anyone else would've got a flagrant when Lebron punched Damion Lee
I thought it was for Damion Lee?
"Honestly I had a bit of fun watching the scrappy young guys fighting for a spot. Damion Lee improving, seeing what we can get out of the G-League and cast-offs from other teams. I'm still sad Marqueese had to be sacrificed, I thought he was turning into an excellent foil for Draymond, better offense (and starting to shoot the 3 pretty decently) and competent defense. I hope they consider him for the 15th roster spot, considering he got cut by the Blazers (I think he was with them? or Sac?). It would be a bit crowded at the front court when James returns, but I feel like having a rotation of solid guys and needing time for all of them is a great problem to have, especially when it's pretty likely that one of them will get injured (just probabilistically). PLus having two +shooters that can play PF/C (Queese and Bjeli) would make it easier to have 4-shooter lineups around James when he gets back, and can make his life a lot easier."
"I wish I could say that was a great development year for the young guys but there's been so much turnover in the rotation the last few years, I'm pretty sure the only guy who got heavy minutes from the hospital Warriors who is still part of the team is Damion Lee lol. Obviously Poole is a much better player now but he had a much smaller role back then too."
"Lol Draymond is a good player, but man he landed into the best situation ever with Klay, Steph (and later KD) and the GS org.  He talks like he’s a team carrying player, and while he’s basically run their offense in recent years his own offensive production has gotten way worse.  Before KD he was an integral part of their offense, and would kill you when trapping Klay and Steph.  He could hit open 3s, drive and dish and was dangerous when he has open space.  I’m recent years though, he doesn’t try to score much and only runs the offense and defers.  The ‘19-20 season was so bad since he was deferring to Eric paschal, Damion lee, and others instead of Klay, Steph and kd.  If Draymond’s offensive game grew instead of regressed, that was a great chance to be a top scorer and really carry a team like the player he talks himself up to be.  If he could score 20 a game in the nba that woulda helped immensely for that team.  But he can’t average 10 now…even on that squad he didn’t want to shoot and just play the same role, but without the same supporting cast that wasn’t gonna work.  Draymond has gotten a lot out of his skill set, but if his offensive skill set kept growing he’d actually be the player he talks himself up to be.  Like who tf talks shit to KD as your teammate, while getting triple singles on a nightly basis?  I can’t believe he doesn’t get clowned more for the dumb shit he’s said and done in his career.  Chasing KD out was clearly horrible for the franchise and while they’re recovering now, Draymond is now saying Kerr and the front office caused KD to leave lmao."
"&gt; Year over year the 2019/2020 Golden State Warriors basically lost Steph Curry, Kevin Durrant and Klay Thompson.  Even beyond the big 3, they essentially lost their entire team: Iguodala, Jerebko, Cook, McKinnie, Livingston, Bell, Cousins, Jones, and Bogut.  Draymond was the only guy who played 400+ minutes for the Warriors in both 2019 and 2020. Damion Lee and Looney were the only other players to play 200+ minutes both years."
"I mean it’s not Damion Lee, sheesh."
"Dude was out there dragging them to the play-in with Bazemore, Looney, Juan Toscano Anderson, Mulder and Damion Lee playing meaningful minutes.  Half the season he had Brad Wanamaker as his point guard.   They had 8 healthy guys against Memphis, and most of those I just listed."
Well we were entirely injured. Damion Lee should have been in most of those minutes unless he was having an off night.
"It is not a heartbeat decision because I don't feel like it's an automatic chip without knowing what Klay can do. And that's a shitload of picks, the later ones probably coming with no (or very old) Curry, Draymond, and Klay.  Obviously Jokic is worth those 4 and at least some picks. But with no Klay you have a team of:  - Curry  - Damion Lee  - Otto Porter (expiring)  - Draymond  - Jokic  Bench:  - Morris  - Bjelica (expiring)  - Toscano-Anderson  - Iguodala (retiring)  - Moody  And Jokic is only signed through 22-23. He could choose to leave a clearly declining core as a free agent."
"They couldn't even handle Damion Lee, Splash Brother-In-Law, they should know their place"
Ah shit this was the Damion Lee game
"They played Lebron, AD, Westbrook, Melo, Dwight and lost to Poole, Otto, Damion Lee. Doesn't matter if it's pre season that is embarrassing"
Damion Lee really looks improved this preseason. Nice to see
"Damion Lee just caused 2 turnovers for the Lakers, DPOY"
Damion Lee just made LeBron look like a fool
Thank you Jesus for this haha.  Damion Lee was a good college player as well.  And it’s not like the Currys didn’t have an NBA dad in the first place haha.
"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damion_Lee  &gt;After going undrafted in the 2016 NBA draft, Lee joined the Miami Heat for the 2016 NBA Summer League. On September 26, 2016, he signed with the Boston Celtics.[14] He was later waived by the Celtics on October 20 after appearing in two preseason games.[15] On October 31, he was acquired by the Maine Red Claws of the NBA Development League as an affiliate player of the Celtics.[16] On January 10, 2017, he was waived by the Red Claws after suffering a season-ending injury.[17] In 16 games, he averaged 17.8 points, 6.3 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 1.1 steals in 34 minutes.[18]  &gt;Santa Cruz Warriors (2017–2018)	Edit On August 24, 2017, Lee was traded to the Santa Cruz Warriors of the NBA G League.[19]  &gt;Atlanta Hawks (2018)	Edit On March 13, 2018, Lee signed a 10-day contract with the Atlanta Hawks.[20][21] On March 23, the Atlanta Hawks signed Lee to a second 10-day contract.[22] On April 2, the Atlanta Hawks signed Lee for the remainder of the season.[23]  perhaps he got acquired by santa cruz initially because of steph (i don't know when they met but damion and sydel got married September 2018), but the heat and celtics all showed some interest in him before that happened, and hawks showed interest after he presumably did pretty well in gleague.  i kind of doubt those teams took a look at him because he was dating steph curry's sister."
Damion Lee is definitely a fringe NBA player even without the help of curry.
As was Seth curry and damion lee.
"Idk.  I’ve heard some theories that it’s because he used to work for the Griz and he has some grudges against the Warriors from his time there, but idk if I buy it.  I think it’s more that he just doesn’t watch Warriors games, at least not since KD left.    Some of his writings and predictions about the Warriors just make no sense when contextualized by recent events.  He predicted Damion Lee to be twice as impactful as Jordan Poole in the upcoming season.  He predicted Kevon Looney to be deep in our bench reserves despite the fact that he’s our second best big.  He talks about how limited our shot creation will be despite the fact that we have Steph, Wiggins, Poole, and now OPJ who are all more than capable of creating for themselves.  Hell, one of the things that just made no sense is he said that it would take an MVP level season from Steph to get us to the playoffs as an explanation for slotting us in at 9th, despite the fact that Steph was top 3 in the MVP race last year and has shown no sign of slowing down.    Given all that, it seems like he’s just skimming box stats for the Warriors without paying any attention to what’s actually going on on the floor."
"No, it's their job to fight for players.  What about the players that are being put at risk by clowns like Irving?  Damion Lee got breakthrough covid after being vaxxed and it cost him a bunch of time."
"More likely? Yes.   Certain? Obviously not.  If I take a revolved with 100 chambers in it, drop one bullet in, spin the chamber and shut it, would you put that gun up to your head and pull the trigger?  I think most would not pull the trigger in that situation, it's all risk and no reward and the risk may be small but if it happens you are fucked. It's like this for COVID. It's not like the vaccines are expensive, or going to turn you magnetic.   Just like the 100 chamber Russian roulette example it's all risk and no reward. So why take the chance? Draymond got COVID before the vaccines came out, he had a relatively bad case without needing hospitalization and reported lingering effects for months after he came back. Damion Lee *was* vaccinated, caught it and had a bad case, missing several weeks during a crucial stretch of the season. Given his reaction despite being vaccinated I wonder how bad it could have been if he wasn't vaccinated.  To me the idea that most people won't die or have a severe case as an argument against getting vaccinated is extremely short sighted. Most of us are aware of /r/HermanCainAward but there are many other cases of people who didn't die but did get really sick, some of them needing to be hospitalized and some having permanent after effects and some having lingering symptoms that eventually, sometimes only after many months, subside."
"Def not Iggy, but   Shaun Livingston, Leandro Barbossa, Ian Clark, Quinn Cook, Alfonso Mckinney (sort of, he did play better than he was before), Mareese Speights, Pat McCaw, Baze (tho you can't really 'fix' bad bbiq) Damion Lee, Jarret Jack, Carl Landry, Marqueese Chriss, etc. Juan Toscano Anderson's playing really fucking well, too.  And while they weren't really reclamation projects, we did get some great vet minutes from previous all-stars, like David Lee, Andrew Bogut, David West, Jermaine O'Neal, etc.   And we find great late first round/second round picks that end up great like Gil, Monta Ellis, Draymond. Here's to hoping Jordan Poole can replicate the magic."
Lmao I'm here Hoping for Steph + Damion Lee core to win and there's people who think the lakers have no shot
"He was on the team when Draymond got it and Draymond had it bad and had lingering effects and then late in the season Damion Lee got it despite being vaccinated and also had a bad case which caused him to miss a few weeks.   I don't think he's someone who doesn't understand it can be serious. I kind of suspect he believes some more conspiracy related stuff about the vaccine. But that's just supposition based on things I've read about his family, only he really knows."
"Lots of players got covid last year without all of their unvaccinated teammates having to quarantine.  For example: Damion Lee tested positive in April, but Wiggins didn't have to quarantine."
"I mean what he’s saying is true. Controversial take but I think athletes should not need the vaccine.   They have access to the best health care even if they do get covid, which many athletes have gotten already like Mitchell, Gobert, Beal, and Damion Lee. In fact Lee even got the vaccine too. They are all fine now…  They are also gonna be tested constantly should they not get vaccine so it’s not like they are gonna super spread it.   Also there’s already a herd immunity in place cause 90% of players already have the vaccine. These 10% like Booker and Wiggins have strong beliefs in what should go in their body or not and ppl should respect it"
I believe it was damion Lee that got covid and only bazemore out of the team needed to be put into a quarantine.   The initial thought was because Wiggins did t do a quarantine he was vaccinated.   Just explaining the scenario btw
Its beyond praise for Steph. The sub all around is just toxic. Like last season if you praised Kerr for anything you were downvoted. If you suggested Steph had a bad game or made mistakes you were downvoted. When Damion Lee missed a game winning shot if you reminded people of the game winning shot and the game tying shot he hit early in the season you were downvoted. Even now if you suggest that Oubre isn't a bum and does have valuable skills like being an elite slasher and good on-ball defender and just wasn't a good fit in GS you get downvoted. Right now if you suggest that Chiozza is getting minutes because with Andre and Lee out he's the only other ball handler on the team you get downvoted lol   Its just a toxic subreddit. And suggesting Steph isn't perfect getting downvoted is just the tip of the iceberg
Stephanie is so bad bro can’t win without damion lee 😂
He’s basically eating up a small amount of Jordan Poole minutes and a big chunk of Damion Lee and JTA minutes. Plug and play
of course. Damion Lee will be kill tho.
If we lose it's because Damion Lee is down in the G-League /s
I love how Damion Lee is just smiling at the end of the clip  He's just like us :D
"He's a starter and the team's second leading scorer, so no it would be more than a point or 2 in the spread. We also have zero wing depth at the moment with Damion Lee/Igoudala out."
"No. But it's not like Damion Lee or Jordan Poole play a lot of great defense either. Curry is playing better defense and with Draymond engaged again and playing like a DPOY again and Wiggins and GPII we've got enough defenders. I mean look at the difference in Warriors last season and this season. We discovered Juan-T at the end of last season, Poole matured, and we added guys like Otto and Beli that can play the motion offense and move the ball. So adding high-iq players that understand and play within Kerr's offense vs guy with more individual talent like Oubre. Klay plays within the offensive system blindfolded. But no, his defense will not be just as good against quicker guards. IMO neither is KDs compared to his years with the Warriors despite everyone agreeing he's fully recovered from achilles. But Klay will still have really solid fundamentals defensively. And should do about as good as before when guarding up. I'm interested in what kind of playoff matchups might be looking to exploit Klay. If Kyrie is back maybe. But it's not like his defense on Lebron or AD will be any different than before. CP3 is not as dangerous as he once was. Is Booker a bad matchup for him? Since we switch everything he's not gonna get killed fighting over screens? We really focus on team defense more this year than ever. I think he'll be fine."
"Who wins Warriors min role players past vs warriors g league?  Bazemore, Bradley, Burks, Oubre, Damian Jones  VS  Chiozo, Poole, Damion Lee, JTA, Wiseman"
Of course Duncan is way taller than Lee he better be better at tight shots. My point is Damion Lee can attack close outs and go for a lay up/pass or floater. Also his shot isn’t slow either. Good shot selection generally and knows the system well to pass it along nicely.
He can’t even attack closeouts or shoot a middie/floater? Ho good of an extra passer/ball movement guy is he? Makes me thing Damion Lee is pretty underrated for a role player (although he had some rough game recently due to a minor injury)
"Warriors with the best record in the league, Klay coming back in the next month, all added on to the fact that Damion Lee became a dad over the weekend, league really fucked"
"He should probably launch more threes.   His percentages would plummet, but it would still be worth it for the team if he can take an extra 3 3PA per game at even 35%.   As it is now, he takes fewer threes per 100 possessions than his brother in law, Damion Lee."
"Same with Joe, longest tenured Net and was out of the league before finally making a name for himself on the Nets, this is his first big contract.  Also are shooters that pricey? Yea the top tier 3+D guys are but I feel like every team has a couple of sharp shooters that aren't getting paid a ton.  Like the Net's best shooter is Mills whose ""only"" getting paid $6m, you guys have Herro whose getting paid $4m, yea he's on a rookie contract but so are Donte and Pat. Sixers have guys like Curry, Furkan, and Niang. Warriors have Otto, Poole, Damion Lee. Even the Lakers have Melo, Ellington, Nunn, and Monk.  I get this article was a puff piece and KOC isn't really the best journalist, but a lot of thing are a tad iffy in the article, especially when he talks about things Allen and Pat can do and Duncan and Harris cant."
"&gt; Too deep for the league.  Yeah, this is the insane thing about this warriors team. If you consider their starting to be Steph, Klay, Wiggins, Draymond, Looney, then their bench is Pool, OPJ, Damion Lee, JTA, GP2, Belica, and even the corpse of Iggy are ALL above average players.   There's literally no time that the other team gets to trot out weak players against the Warriors because they get eaten alive by their swarming D."
Yeah I definitely wouldn't have given Moody those mins Chiozza played in the 1st half when it was still close but either Moody or Kuminga could have come in for the 4th with the game out of reach. I realise these would normally be Damion Lee mins and he's out with his kid being born but it just seems like Chiozza is just a better version of Brad Wanamaker and likely won't be on the team next year.
"One of my favorite things about this team is we've got three guys solidly in the rotation who were G-League last year in JTA, Poole, and GPII and they're all more than earning their place. And Damion Lee was a G League addition the year before and he was playing a lot at the start of the season.  Plus we drafted Steph Dray Klay and Looney.   Despite the league highest luxury tax, it's a homemade roster for the most part."
"Draymond wont be on Booker, but Wiggins, GP2 and Damion Lee are more than enough to throw at him."
"Kuminga gets a handful of 20 minutes run so far  Moody just barely eating up garbage time behind Damion Lee, GP2 in the guard depth."
"Iguodala hasn't been playing either so that's another guy who will see some run vs what the rotations have been the last few games.   Klay will start and Poole will be 6th man. Payton will get Chiozza's minutes (albeit in different situations) and Chiozza and Damion Lee will be banished to the shadow realm except for vet rest days.   JTA has been filling Iguodala's role but has played so well they may find minutes for him when Dre gets back. Wiseman will get some minutes from Bjelica, some from Looney, and some from Payton (strange as that is) but I think he's only gonna be around 10-15mpg unless he balls out. Kuminga and Moody are likely to be staying in Santa Cruz unless (until?) there are injuries. I would not cut Porters minutes, but I like the rest days. They need to keep him engaged, he's going to be valuable come playoff time.  Just my prediction. Need to find 25 min for Klay, 15 for Iguodala and 10 for Wiseman."
Damion Lee.
Damion Lee bouta come back with that coveted DAD energy
Unpopular opinion but I’m not super high on Damion Lee. I don’t think the value he provides is as consistent as some of our other guys.
I don’t think a lot of fans feel this way but I’m not too high on Damion Lee. He’s had a few good moments this season but he doesn’t consistently add value like our other guys do.
"Damion Lee had stretches in previous seasons when he looked like a lifetime G-leaguer, but he's a perfectly adequate 9th or 10th guy in the rotation. He doesn't stand out, but he does fine."
Damion Lee from the Warriors
Seth bout to hear all about it as he waits to hitch a ride with Damion Lee to Steph and Ayesha’s after his post game presser 🥲
I believe Damion Lee as well since he was on the 2019 warriors (57-25) when KD was still around. Also Otto Porter was on the Wizards in 2017 when they were 46-28 at one point
Damion Lee definitely and probably Gary Payton. If Gary Payton could hit 3s Lee would play like 4 minutes a game. Wiseman and Looney will have a more fluid rotation.
"I dunno I felt like there was a lot of learning and necessary time on the floor with curry in there for wiggs, Poole, jta and Damion Lee, on the warriors system as well as setting the stage for a defensive focused team. I don't think warriors get out to the same start they had this year if we don't try last season with curry on the floor."
And the Warriors were without Klay Thompson and James Wiseman. Damion Lee was also out for the Bulls game
Damion Lee is playing 21.5 minutes/game. I imagine he loses the largest share
I swear to fucking God UofL has a curse of being unable to capitalize on great talent since the 2013 title.  Donovan Mitchell and Damion Lee were on the SAME SQUAD poised for a Final Four run at the least and we self-impose a postseason ban.  Then Nwora gets dicked out of the opportunity too.  And it goes beyond basketball. Fucking Bobby Petrino gets a chance at leading Michael Vick 2.0 through college ball and can't finish the job because of a misplaced marker at the Clemson game and wanting to put his son on the staff.
"Are they outscoring Steph, Looney and Damion Lee tho?"
"Bazemore, Oubre, Wanamaker, Mannion, Smailagic, Paschall, fresh Wiggins/Wiseman/Poole. None of them really know how to play with Curry. These players would hold the ball and not move without the ball. Motion offense requires offball movement and identifying where Steph is. If he runs towards you, then you screen for him and then instantly cut to the basket. This simple concept was very difficult for Oubre in particular.   Otto Porter smart player, 3&amp;D, can make the right read and pass for backdoor cuts. Always looking for Steph and ready to screen.  Bjelica smart player, can shoot the 3, tall which allows for him to be very nifty with his passes. His Euroleague game unlocked in NBA for the first time because other teams only used him for his shooting.  Iguodala played with the Warriors.  GP2 smart player, essentially plays the same role Javale McGee did.   Damion Lee, JTA, Wiggins, Poole played with the Warriors through the tough 2 years and learned the system.  TLDR: Warriors got rid of dumb players that wouldn't buy into the system and acquired smart players that love the system."
"Not only will he make you better, he'll work just as hard and be just as selfless as anyone on the team. And he'll be the biggest cheerleader on the team when he's sitting lol. I can't get enough of watching Steph go absolutely nuts on the bench after a GP2 dunk or a Damion Lee triple."
Cade had 25/8/8 2 nights ago and is 4th in the NBA in clutch points per game. Damion Lee is not starting over him lmaooo
Damion Lee outscored your team in the fourth.
Damion Lee: hey maybe my team could use something other than a 0 in my score column on the box score
No Damion Lee slander today lol
I mean playstyle wise they are similar. Less passing but the shot selection is similar. The problem is that he plays like he's Kobe but shoots like Damion Lee
That's Damion Lee.
Both damion Lee and Steph curry outscored the entire cavs team solo. Jta was 1 point off outscoring the cavs team.
Damion Lee outscored the Cavs 9 to 8.
Damion Lee also outscored the Cavs by himself in the 4th... with 9 points.    The Cavs scored 8... EIGHT... in the entire fourth quarter.    yikeslol
Damion Lee ourscored the Cavs 9-8 in the 4th!
I dont want anyone to talk shit to Damion Lee ever again
"Wait, damion lee outscored them  in the 4th too? Lol"
"lol, we thought we were coasting easy on this one. Glad Steph remembered this is the cavs lol.  Also, put mad respect for Damion Lee tonight. He is that kind of role player that will hurt you in crunch time without hesitation."
Remember when Damion Lee getting important minutes was a scary thought?
This is why I love damion lee. He is already a master of the Kerr system
Poole is a trash defender that’s still shooting trash from the perimeter. Damion Lee can’t find his three pointer and Wiggins looks disinterested. Crazy how Curry has to offensively carry against a crippled cavs team
"yeah, looked really sweet in real time but when i slowed the video down here in this clip he obviously double dribbles, can see why Damion Lee stopped playing defense, idk how the ref missed that"
"Legit nobody is going to say that if Curry wins MVP over Jokic while leading his team to the #1 seed with fucking Jordan Poole as the team's 2nd best scorer. I mean hell the top 5 in minutes behind Curry and Draymond are Poole, Damion Lee, Wiggins, Iggy, and Looney. And they 12-2 right now."
"i'm not convinced he even would make us better right now. there's absolutely no way he would have ever had the freedom that he has in charlotte with us. there's no way steph would ever take a backseat to him and there's very little chance steve kerr would allow a player that weak on defense to play in lineups with steph last season and definitely not this season.  the offensive role he has in charlotte is already completely covered by what steph and dray do as a tandem here. damion lee and jordan poole are every bit as good OFF THE BALL(which is what matters when pairing this kid with steph and dray) and they are both uncontroversially better defenders. maybe he could have worked his way up to play 15mpg, in the minutes that steph sits, by the end of the season last year but his defense is so atrocious that i doubt kerr would trust him that much and even less so in a season like this when we are 100% playing for the championship."
"It started being good last season because he was maybe the best defensive guard on the team for the first time in his career, especially when Bazemore was being stupid for whatever reason. Lots of games you’d see Curry step up to get a critical stop when Damion Lee, Poole, Bazemore were all getting abused."
The disrespect to Damion Lee
"My contention is that as long as we get a catch and shoot 3pt shooter of his caliber back then our offense reaches the tipping point to be unstoppable.  In the worst case imagine it being like having a Damion lee with klay like efficiency.  A large issue with the warriors rn is that we don't convert Open 3s very well, klay solves that very well.  I imagine him getting many wide open looks due to steph and dray action. More crucially even if he can't make the back outs and the switch and pops, his gravity itself makes it harder to double steph which in in of itself is a huge boost."
"huh.  this guy looks kind of like damion lee to me, at least with the headband on."
"I mean yeah. The whole team plays around him. There two types of roles on warriors offense. Play making wings like Iggy,dray etc and shooters/cutters like Damion Lee,gp2 etc. Jordan Poole,Wiggins get their own shot when Steph is not there"
Damion Lee had 2 ACL tears.
"What's amazing is the fit. There are better players than Wiggins, JTA, Damion Lee, Dre, Bjelica, but they are dialed in on a philosophical, culture, and strategical level like I've never seen."
Damion Lee isn't some scrub. He has the 4th highest points per game and 4th highest shooting percentage on the Warriors.
Damion Lee is good though
"Iguodala, OPJ, Bjelica, Damion Lee, and GPII are the ones who have leapfrogged JTA in the rotation, and it's regrettable but understandable.  OPJ is a better generalist than JTA and the others are all better at their specialty."
Damion Lee just padding the stats
Even if he’s a literal statue out there he’ll still be better than Damion Lee
"Damion Lee with a business decision, only to get kicked in the business"
I'm so nervous by this lineup. There's like no shooting with Damion Lee kind of cold
Damion Lee bout to get booted from the family for this 😆
Damion Lee is so cold tonight
Damion Lee is so bad lol
"Nah Damion Lee is a good shooter and plays good off of Steph just in lower minutes than we gave him last year for sure, he hasn’t been very good to start the season tho I think coming back from injury. That said he is our #7 pick so if JK can play his way into some minutes by playing good defense he will definitely eat his minutes, probably mixture of bench mob minutes as well."
He should be taking Damion Lee minutes pretty soon. Lee just there eating up minutes because he been around and knows the system better and maybe a better passer? They’re prob the same level of spot up shooter But Moody has him Beat in every other things on defense and scoring around the rim
"Former Hawks:  PG: Dennis Schroeder  SG: Tim Hardaway Jr.  SF: Paul Millsap  PF: Mike Muscala  C: Al Horford  Bench: Damion Lee, Kent Bazemore, DeAndre Bembry, Taurean Prince, Dwight Howard, Dewayne Dedmon  Thank goodness for Trae."
Damion Lee is really trying his best on D but he just doesn’t have it.
Who else can we try as the starting shooting guard? Damion Lee?
"Jordan Bell kind of was the same - high risk high reward. He washed out because he didn't put his  heart into improving and he was kind of an idiot outside of basketball (putting a 5k bill on Mike Brown's tab comes to mind).  We also have JTA and Damion Lee still, but I don't know how high their ceilings get."
Hopefully Damion Lee will be ready to go for the Warriors
"&gt;Jordan Poole was terrible to start last season and was sent to the g-league.  the g-league was compressed into a bubble last season. they announced poole was going to the bubble before the regular season even started so that he could get a high volume of minutes, since he was not really in the rotation yet.  &gt;Damian Lee was barely in the rotation.  bruh, he was fucking closing games for us last year.  &gt;Furthermore LaMelo has been much better than either of those two players.  sure, but that's not how this works. lamelo's lack of defensive iq and gambling for steals would have kept him off the floor under kerr. poole and damion have put in the work to earn kerr's trust."
"You make a good point. The sample size is extremely small during the Kerr era, mostly because we didn't need production from rookies (who were mostly late first round picks at best.)  Recently, Jordan Poole and Damion Lee (not a rookie) are prominent examples. In just under 2 years, both went from being G-League scrubs who many wanted gone to core rotation pieces analysts rave about. How much of that is ""development"" vs signing high-character guys, I don't know.  But Kerr and the FO have made serious upgrades to the coaching/development staff, adding big names like Kenny Atkinson (Nets), Jama Mahlalela (Raptors), and Dejan Milojević (Serbia): https://theathletic.com/news/warriors-hiring-former-nets-coach-kenny-atkinson-as-lead-assistant-sources/Mbc3FLeSQd8q"
"Steph wants the Warriors to give a guy a shot, that guy gets a shot. We tried out Avery Bradley, we picked up Damion Lee, I think a connection to Steph is how we came to try out Alfonso McKinnie.  Steph doesn't decide whether that guy gets *kept*. D.Lee stayed on because the FO saw some potential in him that he's now living up to. McKinnie played pretty well for most of that year.  I think that's the best way to approach it. Your star gets *input*."
"That 2019-2020 lost season was really valuable even outside of the Wiseman pick. Damion Lee showed he was a capable role player, they found JTA late in the year, and Poole got a ton of minutes he wouldn't have. He was objectively awful his rookie year, but he showed he could do a couple things well, and with his work ethic made himself a useful piece. He's still had a bunch of poor games this season, but several really good ones too. 3 different guys have scored 30+ this year, plus different bench guys have shown up every game to provide good minutes and consistent scoring."
"You can make an argument that Draymonds regressed (that argument would mainly be centered on his shooting numbers), but I think the comparison shows how good this team is when you look at the bench.   Iguodala seems to have turned back the clock and is back to being as consistently available and useful as that season.   Bjelica is arguably the best free agent we've had in the past ten years excluding KD and Iggy (other contenders I'm thinking of would be Livingston and Barbosa). Especially at his position, the skills he offers (playmaking, shooting) more than make up for his downsides (defense).  Otto Porter Jr. hasn't even looked like the player that I think he can be for us. I honestly think there's only room for him to get better (assuming he stays healthy), but so far it's just nice to have a vet that knows his role and understands what needs to get done.  Then you add improvements from JTA, Damion Lee, and GPII and our team is at least as deep as the pre-KD ""strength in numbers"" days, if not deeper."
Hoping we have Damion Lee back for the game on Tuesday
"Absolutely terrible take.  It's because JTA, Poole, and Damion Lee continued right where they left last year.  And bacause we replaced Eric Paschal, Kelly Oubre, Nico Manion, Alen Smailagic, and Brad Wanamaker  (ALL NEGATIVES) with Bjelica, OPJ, GP2, Iguodala, Kuminga and Moody."
"""If the team was catered more to his needs""   How do you define that?  So if Steph gets into the playoff w Warriors as the 1st seed he'll be considered a carry? There are no all stars on the team or any all star calibre player. The only person who's close to an all star is Draymond, who many of you are saying is an offensive liability. And he probably wont be an all star. Then you have Klay who's coming back from 2 major injuries. Realistically speaking, he's not going to be the same. The team is filled with people who didnt manage to get a roster spot (Gary Payton II, Juan, Damion Lee) and players who cant get meaningful mins on other teams (Bjelica) and injury prone players like OPJ. In case you talk about last season, Warriors werent catered to Steph needs. Front office was forcing Kerr to play Wiseman. Oubre, Bazemore and Wanamaker doesnt fit out system at all."
"Let's be fair, Damion Lee was a good 6th man during that year and definitely has his spot on the roster today."
"*G-League:* Gary Young Glove, Juan ""Steph's team mate"", Damion ""Only on the squad cause he's a Curry"" Lee.  And also featuring: Jordan ""worst player in the league"" Poole, washed up Otto, washed up Iguodala, draft bust Wiggins &amp; Nemanja can't crack meaningful rotation minutes Bee-a-Liza"""
"Warriors W without Klay, Damion Lee and Draymond playing limited minutes. I'll take that"
That's fair enough but Damion Lee being 6x more effective than Klay Thompson as a shooting guard is not.
"Anyone actually understand the 538 algorithm? It categorizes Klay as a ""scrub"" with 0.3 wins above replacement (WAR), while Damion Lee is a ""rotation player"" with 2.0 WAR at the same position. That's just fucking insane. Like the Warriors ""full strength rating"" is listed as 15 points below their current strength rating, because the algorithm thinks that they're going to get *worse* when Klay can come back and get minutes again.  Vegas odds have the Warriors at 3rd most likely to win the championship this year; 538 had them as 20th in the league with a 0.1% chance."
"Off the top of my head Kat, Rose, and Damion Lee had crazy bad reactions to Covid, Rose said it was the worse illness he's ever had"
"I think they are legitimate contenders. The role players this season understand the system and know how to find their offense. They will have plenty of shooters with Curry, Klay, Poole, Otto, Damion Lee. Unlike last year, they also have playmakers/passers outside of Steph and Draymond. Iggy has been doing a great job distributing, Bjelica has been solid for a big, and Poole is a good shot creator who has now occasionally shown some nice passing.   One of the best things about this team though is that they have a tremendous defender at each level. For guards, they have GP2 off the bench and hopefully at least solid defense from Klay.  For Wings, they are loaded with Klay, Iggy, Dray, and Wiggins. Even Otto Porter is solid defender and will allow the Warriors to have a defender with the strength to matchup with Luka/Lebron/Kawhi if he's back at all times. And then they have Draymond for all the bigs (Jokic will be the one to cause problems) And they have a great coaching with an anchor that makes sure everyone plays coordinated team defense.  It's a very complete team, but I think the X-factor is going to be Wiggins. How good can his defense be on the wings in the western conference? And can he be a legitimate consistent scoring option that can create his own looks when the offense stalls. We know there may be games Curry may not get calls and him and Klay go cold. Wiggins will dictate how far they can go in the playoffs."
"IMO his volume got way too big, even when we didn’t have several rotation members to end last season his FGA and 3PA were noticeably lower. Damion Lee is really the only returning member whose FGA generally increased, so I think he’s adjusting to a much higher volume. I’d say he’d finish about 35~37% from 3 by the end of the season."
"Hmm, nbot sure why it might have returned that. I think first think I'd check is if you're able to run any player (try with a rookie, they have less games and it'll go quicker). If that returns actual output then I'm not sure what to think.  But I ran Klay's data to check/ for you and got this:  | Rank   | Player    | Assists| |:-----------|------------:|:------------:| | 1 | Stephen Curry | 187 | 2 | David Lee | 169 | 3 | Draymond Green | 162 | 4 | Harrison Barnes | 97 | 5 | Kevin Durant | 81 | 6 | Andrew Bogut | 75 | 7 | Andre Iguodala | 72 | 8 | Marreese Speights | 56 | 9 | Zaza Pachulia | 50 | 10 | David West | 42 | 11 | Shaun Livingston | 40 | 12 | Carl Landry | 38 | 13 | Brandon Rush | 35 | 14 | Festus Ezeli | 30 | 15 | Kevon Looney | 27 | 16 | JaVale McGee | 25 | 17 | DeMarcus Cousins | 20 | 18 | Jeremy Tyler | 14 | 19 | Omri Casspi | 13 | 20 | Nate Robinson | 13 | 21 | Quinn Cook | 12 | 22 | Dorell Wright | 11 | 23 | Jonas Jerebko | 11 | 24 | Jordan Bell | 10 | 25 | Charles Jenkins | 10 | 26 | Jermaine O'Neal | 9 | 27 | Patrick McCaw | 8 | 28 | Dominic McGuire | 8 | 29 | Alfonzo McKinnie | 7 | 30 | Damian Jones | 7 | 31 | Richard Jefferson | 6 | 32 | James Michael McAdoo | 6 | 33 | Jarrett Jack | 6 | 34 | Leandro Barbosa | 6 | 35 | Jordan Crawford | 6 | 36 | Monta Ellis | 5 | 37 | Chris Wright | 4 | 38 | Nick Young | 4 | 39 | Ekpe Udoh | 4 | 40 | Damion Lee | 4 | 41 | Ian Clark | 3 | 42 | Matt Barnes | 3 | 43 | Mickell Gladness | 3 | 44 | Andris Biedriņš | 2 | 45 | Anderson Varejão | 2 | 46 | Justin Holiday | 2 | 47 | Steve Blake | 2 | 48 | Jason Thompson | 2 | 49 | Ish Smith | 2 | 50 | Mikki Moore | 1 | 51 | Hilton Armstrong | 1 | 52 | Kwame Brown | 1"
"Poole has been streaky and as a young player he's been a huge benefactor of the Warriors favourable schedule and homestand.  There are moments he looks ""shook"" and goes through his shooting motion before he can set his feet or goes hunting for his shots too aggressively instead of, as Steph brought up in sn interview, letting the flow of the game come to him.  Still a great young player with a bright future but he's a huge variable. The great thing is the Warriors are still 9-1 with him as a starter and imo their best rotation right now would be Damion Lee starting with Poole coming off of the bench.  So 9-1 may be with a favourable schedule but outside of Poole, the Warriors core rotation are seasoned veterans and they still have huge upside in:  (1) Klay coming back  (2) Damion Lee starting &amp; Poole as a sixth man would probably boost their overall team performance even greater  (3) Wiseman may be an impactful rotation player for them this season if he can return and play within a strictly defined role i.e. Javale Macgee 2.0  This Warriors team is built different."
"Myers threaded the needle unless that requires being a top Championship contender. I think it means being a legit dark horse contender, and a team that easily makes the Playoffs while still retaining a higher ceiling next year, so he threaded the needle in my eyes.  Poole's improvement is the huge difference, and the quickness with which Belly and OPJ got how to fit into the offense has also been big. GP2's hustle and figuring out how to add to the scoring with cuts and awareness has been a big ladle of delicious gravy. Damion Lee has stepped it up a notch, too.  Should be a really good regular season for the Dubs. Better than most of us expected. Only problem is that being 10 or 11 deep doesn't really help in the Playoffs.  But if Klay can magically be like old Klay and Wiseman can be trusted to play Playoff minutes, then the team could make some real waves."
And one son in law (Damion Lee is married to Dell Curry's daughter/Steph's sister)
"You think beli will maintain 3 3s a game, GPJ 70% fg percentage, damion lee 45% from 3, and iggy playing elite d with 5+ assists a game?"
"Our new bench mob with Paschall, Wanamaker, Damion Lee, Bazemore, Mulder, etc is surprisingly good, they've been outplaying opponent's second units pretty consistently lately. Paschall especially seems to just feast on backup bigs"
Damion Lee played quite well and was a great option closing the game. I hope we see more of that.
"All Damion Lee does is space the floor; he can't drive or handle the ball at all, he's not much of a passer, and his defense isn't good. I think Oubre provides more of a net positive because he's a good defender. Also, even though he's playing horribly on offense, defenses continue to respect him to some degree. He's not completely ignored. Defenders step up on him because they're scared of him getting a runway to the hoop, so he still provides some spacing."
"damion lee is great in his role. I want to keep the bench as is. Him, paschall, and wiggy really make that unit gel.   I dont want to put paschall in for oubre because paschalls defense is SUS against better quicker players.   However... wouldn't mind someone like Tuscano Anderson in oubre minutes a bit."
I think it is. Oubre provides other aspects better than Damion Lee does.
I always get super nervous whenever I see Damion Lee dribble...
Seriously Damion Lee would be way better starting or even Bazemore than Oubre
Why doesn't Kerr give more minutes to Mulder and Damion Lee with Steph. They make teams pay for the double on Steph
"They nailed Paschall, picked up Damion Lee who is a nice player, revitalized Marquese Chriss who recently broke his leg. Not to mention it's not exactly easy to find talent out of nowhere."
Damion Lee GOAT
Actually not at all  He's 11th on their team in net rating at -5.5  Damion Lee is #1 at +6.8
"ya ppl brought up seth curry in this thread, i've been following his whole career bc of obvious reasons lol and it really is true  he was 2* who went to liberty, managed to transfer to duke, he was on and off our g league team for mad long (waived, signed, waived, signed), some summer league, some 10 days, finally signed w the kings to a tiny deal (2y 2m), barely played for a while, finally got to play, played well!... then had his minutes cut cause george karl is a dickhead (who said he'd flame out of the league lol), went to dallas where he finally got consistent minutes, then had a major injury, and u prolly know the rest  if u look at his first 2 nba years its 1 game w memphis 1 game w cleveland 2 games w phoenix, each time being assigned or waived right after  also if we're talking about the random nepotism stuff, damion lee also kinda looks like a decent rotational nba guy who seemed to only be signed to our g league team cause he's steph's brother in law lol  u really never know there's a lot of randomness to it"
Guess if you're somehow related to the Curry's you're popping the fuck off right now. Steph back looking in MVP mode. Seth looking to have a career year. Damion Lee Hitting big shots for the warriors and also their top 3pt shooter. Doc Rivers bringing life back to Philly. And now Austin. Sheesh
"Beating the fucking Bulls and Pistons. We should've been 1-3 but Damion Lee saved our asses.  Admit it man, you do not watch a team's off ball defense."
Wiggins brought a winning effort and we kept giving Damion Lee and Oubre looks.
Clearly Damion Lee and Paschall are the real superstars we should trade that trash Steph
"Because he wouldn't knock anybody off our roster, look at our guards  Curry - Self explanatory  Wanamaker - Just a better all around player  Damion Lee - not nearly as useless defensively and at least comparable offensively  Mulder - fills a very specific niche and is 5 years younger  Jordan Poole - he's 21  JTA and Mannion - two-way contracts  This is how it is for most teams, as I said he could probably be a borderline rotation player for several teams but he's 31 and fills just about the least valuable basketball archetype, teams are gonna prefer rolling the dice with guys like Lee, Mulder, and Poole over him for a number of reasons."
"These first 10-15 or so games are basically summer league, training camp, and preseason for a team returning only two other players with substantial experience playing with Steph (Draymond, Looney). Every win in this beginning stretch, even against supposedly ""bad"" teams, are going to be huge as this team figures itself out throughout the season. These ""bad"" defensive teams are when the Warriors and Kerr will have the luxury to tinker and experiment.  I see this season as a ""luxury"" rebuild year. We'll likely have two first-round picks next year to add to a developing young talent in Wiseman. Other young players will build valuable experience playing with Steph and Draymond as they age into the twilight of their careers, and we'll be able to evaluate them before we ease Klay back in hopefully next year. The ""luxury"" bit comes with the fact that we have very a real chance to make the playoffs while still being able to add strong talent near the top of the draft next year.  Some of my takeaways of the roster so far from 7 games:  * Steph is still Steph. He usually starts the season cold and heats up around the ASB, but he will be pressed early and often this year. Prayers up for his health, I still cringe every time he drives into traffic trying to do it all for this team's offense. * Draymond still contributes in so many ways outside of the box score. Offensively you already see his impact as Steph's partner in the PnR and with the dimes. Our defense is worlds better with him in there barking and directing traffic. I don't know what else he can do to show he can be a floor-raiser on the defensive end.  * Wiseman still looks lost out there but him just being on the floor impacts the game. He's only going to get better throughout the year as he develops chemistry and adjusts to the speed of the NBA game. * Wiggins is performing exactly to my expectations so far this year and still has room to grow. Again, we'll have to hold our breaths here for sustained effort, but we've now got a 19 game sample size of Warriors Wiggins (12 games last year) where he's averaged 18.7p/4.9r/3.1a/1.0s/1.4b on splits of .438/.359/.685 and he's not taking any of Steph's minutes or touches at PG. Still got that MIN first rounder coming next year too... * Kelly, you pretty motherfucker. His shot will regress back to the mean eventually, but he sure does love driving into traffic to throw up bad shots. Good effort, and we may be able to retain him past this year on a reasonable contract with his Bird Rights. * With Chriss' unfortunate injury, Paschall has been thrust into minutes as a bench small-ball C which has completely opened up his offensive game. I'm seeing shades of the Carl Landry/Mo Speights/David West role for him moving forward * Looney's experience playing with Steph helps him stay on the floor against other bench Cs and he finally looks valuable again. His experience in the playoffs shows in his defensive effort against penetration. So glad we don't have to start him anymore, though. * Damion Lee has won me over. I think he can be a solid last man on the bench on any team in the league with his shooting ability, and has shown some real swagger lately with clutch shooting. I can't be upset with him playing 10-15 minutes per game if needed. * Mychal Mulder, my goodness. The man can catch-and-shoot off screens just like Steph and Klay. He's going to see a lot more minutes and trust from Kerr moving forward. * Chriss' injury has also opened up a spot for Juan Toscano-Anderson. I'm not really sure what position he plays to be honest, but I like what I've seen from him in his limited time. Not to conjure up more ""Andre 2.0"" memes, but I love the confident way he brings the ball up on breaks like Andre used to, which opened up Steph/Klay corner threes on the break. Defensively he's got good energy and decent hands. * Bazemore's energy is great and will be a good veteran piece backing up the wing spots. * Wannamaker has been good in his role, no complaints. Just a steady hand at backup PG. * Poole still doesn't look ready with the ball in his hands, but I've seen him do a lot of good things with the ball despite the shaky handle and decision-making. He's a wild card and still needs development time, but I can still see the potential for a backup combo guard."
"The Warriors aren't bad. They just got off to a bad start. Losing Chriss will really hurt their contention for the playoffs, but this is a pretty solid team. They just need to get used to playing with each other and get in the groove. They have a nice second unit where Wiggins and Paschall can be aggressive and take a lot of shots. And they have good role players like Bazemore, Damion Lee, Mulder, Toscano-Anderson. They only have 2 real centers which is concerning against teams like the Blazers, Lakers, etc."
1. Mychal Mulder 2. Juan Toscano Anderson 3. Brad Wannamaker 4. Jordan Poole 5. Damion Lee 6. Alan Smailagic 7. Nico Manion
Damn. Damion Lee is fine on the Warriors for life now.
Damion Lee is married to Sydel Curry (the sister of Steph and Seth)
"Hi! Bulls fan here! I actually don’t remember Damion Lee hitting a single 3 when we played you guys, so you’re wrong I think  Edit- was meant for the guy above you"
"Damion Lee is at 12/24 from 3 so far, I think 42~44% is sustainable"
"Curry went off again despite playing back-to-back and trying to heat up the offence instead of scoring.  Dray silenced everyone that was slandering him and showed how important he is to the team again.  We all knew wiseman was insane but damn  Oubre and Wiggins bout to be drug tested after making their threes. Jokes aside, it looks like they're adjusting more to the warriors system and having less tunnel vision when getting the ball  Looney, Damion lee looking good as always and the bench that played the 4th looks promising playing warriors style basketball instead of heaving shots for stats.   Got to love how things are looking, we're definitely getting back to playing warriors ball.  Gg kings, yall will find the rhythm soon man it just happened to be an off night. Can't wait to see yall bounce back."
what about Damion Lee game winner against the Bulls?
"Steph is a feet guy, but Damion lee is a necrophiliac 😨😨"
Depends: are Damion Lee (married to Sydel Curry) and Austin Rivers (sister Callie is married to Seth Curry) honorary Currys?
"Terrible take, and would look even more terrible when damion Lee and blaze more are playing 40 MPG"
Damion Lee\*. Put some respect on the GOAT's name.
"Damion ""Splash Cousin"" Lee looking nice"
Damion Lee is also Steph's brother in law
"Sorry if I'm slow, but what is this referencing? Damion Lee being married to Steph's sister?"
"Pretty much how Damion Lee got his spot on the Warriors, being Steph's brother in law. But Lee is a decent role player."
Obviously this is not a great time to shit on him but Damion Lee might be the clumsiest looking dude I've ever seen on a court.
"On the Hornets-Philly game tonight (Dell is play-by-play and Seth is on Philly) they mentioned that Steph, Seth, and their brother-in-law, Damion Lee, are all shooting 100% from the line to start the season.   Steph: 76/76  Seth: 14/14  Lee: 5/5"
"Things that I’ve seen from the Warriors that are encouraging this season: Wiseman as a whole, Damion Lee playing pretty decent when he actually gets playing time, and players getting open shots. The only problem is that those shots aren’t made. And they weren’t beaten by the Bulls, so I’m not 100% sure why that even matters."
"Think about the games the warriors have played. They've been blown out three times, they had a 1-point win off a buzzer beater from Damion Lee against the Bulls, and a 10-point win over the Pistons who would be winless if Boston didn't have an absolute horror show in the last five minutes and lose by a single point in a game Pistons fans were surprised they won."
"We are finding out once KD left the Warriors management aren't light years ahead of the league. They couldn't replace Andre Iguodala a wing who can guard perimeter on defense, and switch if they need to. On offense he can be ball handler, playmaker, cutter, and good screener. Shaun Livingston veteran point guard who help the bench handle the ball, get buckets in midrange with his height and length, make necessary passes, set good screens, and can defend the perimeter. They don't have a big who can defend the paint well like Bogut or Durant. Who else on this team you are scare of shooting or make good decisions on the court consistently besides Curry? All 4 games warriors are getting cooked by their opponents, and they can barely get any stops. Curry gravity is still lethal, but his gravity can't overcompensate flawed players in Andrew Wiggins, Kent Bazemore, Damion Lee, Kevon Looney, Nico Mannion, Mychal Mulder, Kelly Oubre Jr, Eric Paschall, Jordan Poole, Juan Toscano-Anderson, Brad Wanamaker, Draymond Green, and James Wiseman against good teams"
Steph has looked so frustrated in these games. The only times I seen him happy on court was in Chicago where Damion Lee came in clutch and in Detroit where they were competitive against one of the worst teams in the league.  Steph hates this right now and it’s extremely visible. He started at the low floor but to be on top of the world and be on the way back down has gotta be tough for anyone. He’s gotta adjust and play his best (which he has not for most of these games so far)  I just feel like we’re wasting 2 years of his prime and I think he feels that way too. It sucks. And so does our team.
wasnt one won on a game winner by damion lee? So one shot away from being 1-4
Melo absolutely destroying DPOY candidate Damion lee
"Lineup of Wanamaker, Damion Lee, Baze, Wiggins, and Paschall..."
Damion Lee played with Steph too
Damion lee
"Ah. Tbf there’s a scenario where Wiseman beats out Looney but because of load management Kerr starts Poole, letting Klay play with the second unit and close with Curry. Kind of what Damion Lee is doing now."
Damion Lee married Steph Curry's sister..?
"Damion Lee for Ben, done.  Seriously though the chemistry right now is so good (even as we are fine tuning) that I want to just freeze it."
"&gt;You don't watch the game so you don't see him constantly passing out of WIDE open 3s.  I watch more than you that's for sure lmao. You called his defense overrated, that's all I needed to here. Yeah, he passes out of some open 3s, but it's not ""Constantly."" This is what I hate about people like you on r/nba. It's all extremes. No actual substance in the takes. Ridiculous.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;When the lane is wide open. Despite that he is shooting 45.5% from 2 and shooting 33% from 0-3 feet. Just sit down moron     You just suggested JTA should shoot contested 3s and drive into clogged lanes LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. And you called me a moron.   [He shot](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/toscaju01.html) 82% from 0-3 feet last season, your 7 game sample size means NOTHING. NOTHING LMAO. He shot 70% from 2 last season. Your argument is falling in on itself and crumbling. Cherrypicked evidence again. I'd call you a moron but that's just harsh for no reason. Your argument is completely awful and idiotic.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt; Chiozza played 5 minutes and Damion has one of the best impact metrics on the team. He shared big minutes with Poole and Curry this game or did you not watch?     He played nearly that whole 4th where our net rating was tanked by Chiozza and the garbage time unit. Lee played good till the 4th quarter, and even HIS IMPACT METRICS WAS TANKED LMAO! You said ""one of the best impact metrics on the team"" but the 4th quarter was so bad that he was a -2.  Otto, who was amazing, was also a -3 because of the 4th quarter. Your argument crumpled up and failed AGAIN.  &amp;#x200B;  Literally ALL of your arguments fell apart instantly fam. Sit down."
I said mildly contested. You don't watch the game so you don't see him constantly passing out of WIDE open 3s. If you can't take wide open 3s you're not an NBA level player. Only guys like Draymond gets a pass because he can actually defend. Athletic Alchemy who actually watches the game pointed this out numerous times.   &gt; He's fantastic at driving and super aggressive going downhill.  When the lane is wide open. Despite that he is shooting 45.5% from 2 and shooting 33% from 0-3 feet. Just sit down moron   &gt; He was -5 because he played with Chris Chiozza and Lee was missing everything.  Chiozza played 5 minutes and Damion has one of the best impact metrics on the team. He shared big minutes with Poole and Curry this game or did you not watch?   &gt; he's trying to help and carry the entire defense  Jesus imagine believing this
Is it me or does Damion Lee move faster and with more precision now
I'd run with Steph/Klay/Poole/Wiggins/Draymond   So based on minutes so far that would be Damion Lee who loses out
"Steph is shooting the worst percentages of his career and averaging the most turnovers he's ever had. Still the Warriors are 7-1 (not the toughest schedule tho).  If Poole continues his development, Curry get back to his usual effeciency (he started slow last year aswell), Klay comes back at a decent level and there's just some kind of production from the rookies, it looks very, very good for The Warriors. The defense has been so good and this year the other players than Steph are making shots.  Gary Payton ll is starting to emerge as an actual viable guard. His defense is top notch.   Damion Lee has been scoring very well for his role - he's shooting 48,5% from 3.   Draymond has not been a complete scoring liability.   Both Otto Porter and Bjelica have been very solid coming off the bench too.   &amp;#x200B;  As a GSW fan I'm pleasantly surprised. I expected the team to be good, but not this good. Poole was expected to take a step forward and he has. The role players have been the big surprise."
The development of our bench players like Damion Lee has been really impressive. He was a g-league quality player a few years ago and now he is a consistent 10-12 point bench player who plays ok defense.
Our small ball lineup is deep now. I can see Otto porter making it and what about Iguodala? Damion Lee? Duuude
"My favorite quote when the Warriors beat the Rockets on Christmas without Steph and Klay a few years ago: ""Where would Steve Kerr be without generational talent like Damion Lee?"""
Damion Lee been pretty good to start off
"Hey that's better than when I called Nic Claxton ""Speedy"" last year lol.  No I meant Damion Lee, he is killing it right now.   The Dubs don't have a ton of roster flexibility or size but they have like 4-5 guys at the end of the bench that are all really athletic, can shoot and switch on defense, and have a few years in the system.   They're secretly pretty deep."
"We gotta get a deep run this season because this team won't last. We're getting quality minutes from at least 4 players on one year vet mins: Bjelica, OPJ, Iguodala, and GP2. Damion Lee is currently having a break out season and he's on the last year of his deal. We can't bring them all back, someone is gonna offer at least some of them more than we can afford (aka the vet min). That's gonna be heart breaking"
"They haven’t earned it. They were playing garbage time with Damion Lee, JTA, and GP2- the three poster boys of undrafted, work hard, earn it players. You can tell they’re passive and have this need to earn it and prove it attitude. I actually really love that about them considering they’re top 15 picks."
"All on the same team one day?   Dray Jr. Canon Curry, Damion Lee/Sydell's kid, Seth's kid, and one of Klay's Instagram thot babies."
"Though...y'all have  Curry, Dray, Wiggins, (Klay), Poole, Looney, (Wiseman), Bjelica, Otto, Iggy, Damion Lee, JTA, GP2, and two lotto picks in Moody/Kuminga. Where would Paschall have fit into that roster?"
You mean Kelly Olynyk not Kelly Oubre lol.  I really havent watched many GSW games but did you mean Jordan Poole instead of Damion Lee?
"Nunn is redundant but we also need shooting right? So is he really that redundant? Im clueless how additional depth is ever a bad thing or not obviously a benefit when we inevitably have more depth to 3 rotation players joining.   If iggy, Damion Lee, and Porter Jr were all out for you do you think that would have no impact? Especially if your best player also didn’t play? Like come on."
"I agree, it's a talent issue for sure.  IDK why people are just running with the idea Miami is the same team they were two years ago.  They were a great 3pt shooting team that year.   It's a different team now.  They don't have Dragic, Crowder, and Kelly Oubre who were all good to great 3pt shooters for them during that playoff run.       I do kind of disagree with you, on the last part though.  IDK why it's a stretch those are title contenders.     GS is great right now.  Steph is 27-8-7 and he's not even playing that well.   People have been dismissive of Wiggins the entire time he's been there, but he was a borderline All-NBA guy last year.   Damion Lee has been absolutely incredible so far.   I don't know if they have the roster flexibility to really make a deep title run without Klay, but they won't have to, and in the mean time they can run out some really scary 2-way switching lineups with all the big athletic swings at the end of their rotation.     NY added a bunch of good players to the backcourt, Quickley has continued to improve and looks awesome, and they have Robinson back.    They are much, much better than they were last year.   I certainly wouldn't be surprised if they clicked and went on a run.     People slept on Memphis all last year, but Jazz fans at least saw how competitive that team was. They go 10 deep with skilled, tall, athletic players who can create their own shot and even people that love Ja continue to sleep on him by downplaying the upside of this team.   Bane has made a leap.  It's going to take people most of the year to even begin the realization that their Stephen Adams / NO takes were lazy and he's not making $30 million a year anymore.  The only thing that is really a question mark with them in terms of their ceiling is how much they will get from JJJ.    I wouldn't bet on it, but they are definitely going to be a brutal draw in the playoffs and if JJJ turns it up that team is going to be super difficult to beat in the playoffs.  The Clippers look like shit, but the same roster made the WCF without Kawhi and were definitely good enough to win it last year IDK you can just write them off."
That and Damion Lee is married to his sister
"Seth Curry vs Ben Simmons phenomenon.   A lot of bad on ball defenders also make up for it in team defense but it is just harder to quantify. Seth isn't bad though. Damion Lee is also having a similar effect on the Warriors. Being a 2 way player is overrated in the NBA, even younger Kawhi didn't stand out in defense rating at all compared to guys like Draymond or Gobert."
"&gt;	he’s the only other player we have that is capable of getting hot like Steph   Of the games I’ve watched Damion Lee has been catching fire as well, hits huge momentum changing shots IMO.  Jordan Poole has been incredible as well, but I wouldn’t say it’s *just him*"
No love for Damion Lee? His ppg went up from 6.5 to 14.3 on better efficiency.
Is he better than Damion Lee? Because that’s all he needs to be to boost this roster. And he’s gonna be much better than 60%
Damion Lee does not defend the best perimeter player and casually gets 17 points in almost every game. Chill out before you ever write something like that
Damion Lee: 15 points on 8 shots   Wiggins: 14 points on 13 shots   Damion Lee is averaging more points on way higher efficiency this season. And yet Wiggins is paid 30 million a year. Jesus
Damion Lee: 15 points on 8 shots   Wiggins: 14 points on 13 shots   Damion Lee is averaging more points on way higher efficiency this season. And yet Wiggins is paid 30 million a year. Jesus
Damion Lee is more consistent and efficient than Wiggins
Damion Lee has developed into a solid role player.
Damion Lee is out as well the only bad thing is the Warriors are getting a little thin
And Damion Lee. And Jordan Poole. Warriors are screwed in the coming years.
"Warriors fan here!  I feel great about the Dubs, 5-1 ain't bad. Steph will be fine, I believe he will have a good season ahead of him. I believe he will break Klay's record. I hope Draymond will continue to score like his 2015-2016 self because we need it. Once Klay returns to his old self, I can see that this Warriors team is like the 2014-15 Warriors.  I think turnovers and sloppy plays are ruining our momentum and the game and I think they should limit those mistakes. We should have won the Grizzlies game if it wasn't for our 23 turnovers.  Damion Lee suprised me because he improved and became a key factor on the team. Some fans don't want him on the team and they say that he's here cause of nepotism but I believe DLee deserves to be here. Dude can shoot and contribute (10 pts +). Also, I was suprised by Bjelica, he can contribute right away. Can score, make good plays but not suitable for small ball opponents since we need fast players. I am disappointed in our sloppy plays and the turnovers we are causing.  Like I said, Bjelica is a great addition. Also, OPJ is worth the vet minimum. He is a 40%+ 3pt shooter in his career. Both of them are great fits, hope OPJ will not get injured. And most importantly, it's great they got Andre Iguodala back since he knows our system and can improve the team's chemistry and be a mentor to the young guys.  I agree that Moody and Kuminga will be sent to the G-League for their development. Even though Moody played a few minutes, he can score and pass the ball. I am high on the 2 rookies and I believe they will succeed.  Once Klay and Wiseman are back, I hope we suprise the basketball world soon."
"I'm optimistic, but I'm not sold on any offensive option on this team other than Steph. Jordan Poole is being way too overhyped, Andrew Wiggins is not reliable in crunch time. Otto is a good role player, nothing more. Andre is still playing well, can't hit a shot though. Draymond is playing a lot better this year, but I still cringe every time he shoots.   We're heading into close games with Steph's brother-in-law (Damion Lee) as our second-best offensive option, and that's just not gonna cut it. We absolutely need Klay back healthy, playing at least at 80% of what he used to."
Record; better then I expected.  Damion Lee way better then I expected so far.  Poole slightly underwhelming for me so far but understandable.  Overall I’m very happy with our start.
"We've started off well, huge improvement over last year.   Bjelica, Porter and Iggy being back are great additions to the bench. The ball movement with the bench unit is great to watch. Damion Lee has proved me wrong and has probably been our 3rd or 4th best player this year. Cannot wait to see how we look when Klay comes back."
"Include Damion Lee in there too, dude makes almost everything in clutch time. Now you assembled the splash family. Maybe bring in Jordan Poole. Defense will be trash but god offense overcomes trash defense."
Damion Lee got dapped up hard the other day for doing this exact thing lol i mean realistically this happens like once or twice a game based off the dubs game I watch. Like combined. It’s a clear path foul a decent amount. Anecdotally I don’t think it’s as big of a deal as people make it out to be
"Utah Jazz have been known for their depth for a while during this run of doing great but not doing anything in the playoffs.  Warriors bench will look real nice when all the starters are healthy (hopefully). Jordan Poole, Igoudala, Otto Porter, Bjeli, Looney or Wiseman, GP2, Damion Lee, JTA, the rookies."
"On the bright side, we’re 4-1 despite turning the ball over 15+ times in 4 of our 5 games and we’ve yet to play an A+ game with both low turnovers and hot shooting happening at the same time (Curry has also shot the ball up to his standards just once this season). Damion Lee has been stellar off the bench and our free agent signings look good (their on/off numbers are pretty amazing to start).   With that said, our starting lineup isn’t really meshing all that well. We’ve had trouble getting Poole going and our closing lineup’s spacing is kinda suspect. The way we played last night is a D+ game at best with how cold shooting was paired with sloppy turnovers ever since the end of the 1st quarter.   Hope the Grizzlies game is a wake-up call of some sorts in terms of how the Warriors can figure things out. Thankfully we do have a bit of a soft schedule to start that we really need to take advantage of."
Damion Lee?
Where were you when Damion Lee led the warriors to a 5-0 start
damion lee has been big off the bench so far this szn
Damion Lee pls
Damion Lee
"Dawg you’re delusional if you think Dame was on par or better than Steph last year.  Steph averaged:  32 ppg, 6 ast, &amp; 5 reb on 48/42/91 splits  Dame averaged:  29 ppg, 7 ast, &amp; 4 reb on 45/39/93 splits  Steph was more efficient (65 ts% vs 61 ts%) while having a usage rate of 35% while Dame had 31% usage. This is because Dame’s supporting cast had more weapons with better spacing and continuity. Stephs second and third best offensive teammates were Wiggins and Damion Lee while Dames were CJ and Norm Powell. Again, I love Dame, but Steph is just on another level"
