"oh him i assumed we were talking aabout justin robinson, david robinson son"
"&gt; Traded Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario ≈†ariƒá and a 2022 2nd round draft pick to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Jimmy Butler and Justin Patton.  &gt; Traded Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Landry Shamet, a 2020 1st round draft pick (Saddiq Bey was later selected), a 2021 1st round draft pick (Tre Mann was later selected), a 2021 2nd round draft pick (Jeremiah Robinson-Earl was later selected) and a 2023 2nd round draft pick to the Los Angeles Clippers for Tobias Harris, Boban Marjanoviƒá and Mike Scott. (Pick is MIA's 2021 1st-round pick.) (Pick is DET's 2021 2nd-round pick.) (Pick is DET's 2023 2nd-round pick.)  They really didn‚Äôt trade that much for Butler. They traded a lot to the Clippers for Harris who was on a contract year and was a borderline all-star.  I agree that the 76ers set up Ben for failure though. Simmons was the 4th-5th option on the 2019 76ers that went 7 against Toronto. If they could have kept Butler and flipped Simmons then for pieces to build around Butler-Embiid than the 76ers would have been a perennial title threat."
"Yeah Allen Robinson, Justin Fields, and David Montgomery sure do suck at football."
"See I actually watch *and* understand basketball. Might wanna work on that other part.    Their are levels of talent in the NBA beyond just ‚Äústars‚Äù and ‚Äúrole players‚Äù. Mainly ‚Äúend of bench guys‚Äù.   The Lakers don‚Äôt really have many legitimate role players on their roster anymore. They traded most of that talent besides THT when they got Westbrook.   The ‚Äúrole players‚Äù LA has right now are more in the end-of-bench category outside of a couple. You can‚Äôt just put all the blame on them and assume they would step up to fill the hole in depth that Caruso and KCP left. That‚Äôs why Caruso is Caruso and KCP is KCP.    It‚Äôs like the Bucks during their first ten or so games‚Äî were scrubs like Justin Robinson and Sandro Mamukelashvili role players? No, they were high-end G League guys who had to pretend they were better than they actually were. And the Bucks lost a lot of those games as a result. Difference being Milwaukee just had to wait for guys to get healthy‚Äî LA‚Äôs roster just looks fundamentally lost."
Surprised no one has said Steph.  Still a distant second to Justin Robinson but I don't think anyone else has a good argument
"Semi and Justin Robinson for Mychal Mulder, who says no?"
"The chemistry between Giannis and a two-way guy brought in to cover the injuries at PG is bizarrely good. Justin Robinson does still need some hand-holding, but the action with Giannis has looked really good."
"Been the case for them basically this entire year, opponent's players sitting (either for legitimate injuries or just ""load management"") and then still winning.  We had Semi Ojeleye, Justin Robinson, Thanasis, George Hill, and Jordan Nwora all playing 20+ minutes, with Giannis as our only normal starter playing 27 minutes (though I guess Grayson Allen has probably taken the job from Donte at this point, so him too, with 22 minutes)..... And won by 28.  Loyal Pistons fans buying tickets this year are definitely not getting a good show for their money."
"The new rookies ( Mamu is not playable right now because he will foul out with 5 minbut he can develop in g league), Rodney hood, Justin Robinson . The jury is still out on semi ojeley"
"He'll lose a little when Middleton comes back, but Donte is a better fit off the bench.  I think you'll see Hill's minutes go down, and Justin Robinson won't see the court again."
Justin robinson is so bad
Justin robinson isn‚Äôt good
"Hmm, nbot sure why it might have returned that. I think first think I'd check is if you're able to run any player (try with a rookie, they have less games and it'll go quicker). If that returns actual output then I'm not sure what to think.  But I ran Klay's data to check/ for you and got this:  | Rank   | Player    | Assists| |:-----------|------------:|:------------:| | 1 | Stephen Curry | 187 | 2 | David Lee | 169 | 3 | Draymond Green | 162 | 4 | Harrison Barnes | 97 | 5 | Kevin Durant | 81 | 6 | Andrew Bogut | 75 | 7 | Andre Iguodala | 72 | 8 | Marreese Speights | 56 | 9 | Zaza Pachulia | 50 | 10 | David West | 42 | 11 | Shaun Livingston | 40 | 12 | Carl Landry | 38 | 13 | Brandon Rush | 35 | 14 | Festus Ezeli | 30 | 15 | Kevon Looney | 27 | 16 | JaVale McGee | 25 | 17 | DeMarcus Cousins | 20 | 18 | Jeremy Tyler | 14 | 19 | Omri Casspi | 13 | 20 | Nate Robinson | 13 | 21 | Quinn Cook | 12 | 22 | Dorell Wright | 11 | 23 | Jonas Jerebko | 11 | 24 | Jordan Bell | 10 | 25 | Charles Jenkins | 10 | 26 | Jermaine O'Neal | 9 | 27 | Patrick McCaw | 8 | 28 | Dominic McGuire | 8 | 29 | Alfonzo McKinnie | 7 | 30 | Damian Jones | 7 | 31 | Richard Jefferson | 6 | 32 | James Michael McAdoo | 6 | 33 | Jarrett Jack | 6 | 34 | Leandro Barbosa | 6 | 35 | Jordan Crawford | 6 | 36 | Monta Ellis | 5 | 37 | Chris Wright | 4 | 38 | Nick Young | 4 | 39 | Ekpe Udoh | 4 | 40 | Damion Lee | 4 | 41 | Ian Clark | 3 | 42 | Matt Barnes | 3 | 43 | Mickell Gladness | 3 | 44 | Andris Biedri≈Ü≈° | 2 | 45 | Anderson Varej√£o | 2 | 46 | Justin Holiday | 2 | 47 | Steve Blake | 2 | 48 | Jason Thompson | 2 | 49 | Ish Smith | 2 | 50 | Mikki Moore | 1 | 51 | Hilton Armstrong | 1 | 52 | Kwame Brown | 1"
Khris Middleton On Giannis Antetokounmpo-Justin Robinson Friendship: ‚ÄúThey Sit Next To Each Other In The Locker Room. They Go Out To Dinners. Dates And Stuff.‚Äù
"Kalaitzakis had I think one decent game against the Mavericks, but overall was pretty uninspiring. He plays defense well-enough, rebounds and can make the occasional pass but that's about it.  &gt; if I'm Bud, I'm treating this as an extra preseason game. Trot everyone to court and see if you have a hidden rotation guy buried in the bench.  That's exactly what's been happening the last 5-7 games. Justin Robinson is a two-way PG who was cut by the Thunder last year after 9 games. He's played as many minutes as Sengun. Sandro Mamukelashvili, a 54th pick on a two-way contract drafted to the defending champions has played more minutes than *19* first round picks. Bucks went into the season with an empty roster spot - which worked well last season since it meant they could get Teague and PJ - so the rotation is just so short right now that regardless of what Bud wants to do everyone is getting minutes."
"Giannis/Grayson/Hood are all on the injury list for this game, but only as probable.  In seriousness, if those 'probables' don't play, here my attempt at a possible depth chart;  PG: George Hill/Justin Robinson/Thanasis Antetokounmpo  SG: Pat Connaughton/Jordan Nwora  SF: Jordan Nwora/Pat Connaughton/Thanasis Antetokoumpo/Georgios Kalaitzakis  PF: Thanasis Antetokoumpo/Semi Ojeleye/Sandro Mamukelashvili  C: Bobby Portis/Sandro Mamukelashvili"
Justin Robinson   Jordan nwora   Rodney Hood  Thanasis Antetokounmpo  Sandro Mamukelashvilii  Oh my god I got Sandro right first try
Justin Robinson  Jordan Nwora  Rodney Hood  Thanasis Antetokounmpo  Sandra Mamakushlavii
At one point the Bucks ran a line-up of:  Justin Robinson  Jordan Nwora  Rodney Hood  Thanasis Antetokounmpo  Sandro Mamukelashvili
"who tf else is gonna guard him, Justin Robinson?"
"Yikes. Kyrie might be less important to the Nets than JUST Jrue is to the Bucks right now.   We're missing both of our starting guards and 2 of the 3 bigs we have that should actually be NBA players. We'd literally be better with all these 4 healthy and Giannis out. We're giving Thanasis, Sandro, Hood and Justin Robinson starter/key player minutes."
VT basketball also tried to do this to UVA while getting their asses kicked. UVA had a guy run back and stuff their shit from behind lmao. Believe it was Justin Robinson who pulled this
i guess what i meant was ‚Äújust above pond scum‚Äù so we never get a high draft pick (but still have a chance to pick someone good like lillard or klay or mitchell or bam but we end up picking thomas robinson or jimmer fredette or justin jackson) except when we do and draft marvin bustley except for the last two seasons when we were actually mediocre except for this season where we legitimately looked like a g league team for stretches but we won‚Äôt fire our elementary school rec league coach because we have to have a culture of ‚Äúconsistency‚Äù üòÉüëç
Kings First Pick past decade  2020 Pick 12 - Tyrese Haliburton  2019 Pick 40 - Justin James  2018 Pick 2 - Marvin Bagley  2017 Pick 5 - De'Aaron Fox  2016 Pick 8 - Marquese Chriss  2015 Pick 6 - Willie Cauley-Stein  2014 Pick 8 - Nik Stauskas  2013 Pick 7 - Ben McLemore  2012 Pick 5 - Thomas Robinson  2011 Pick 7 - Bismack Biyombo
is this Monmouth Justin Robinson? if so hes a MAAC Legend!
"Exactly this. We have been drafting ""for fit"" for years and look at where it's gotten us. Besides 2018 and 2020, Kings fans have been wrong about every draft it seems. We took Thomas Robinson ahead of Lillard due to fit. We traded down to get Justin Jackson and Harry Giles in 2017 because we already had WCS/just drafted Fox and didn't want to take one of Zach Collins, Bam, or Mitchell for ""fit"". McNair did the right thing taking who he thinks was the BPA at our position. At worst, it sets us up with tradeable assets."
"Yeah, the move is another 6'0 washout. We've got 2 rostered, just need 1 more  Who's keeping track from just the past 2 seasons? I am....  Isaiah Thomas, Ish Smith, Raul Neto, Cassius Winston, Chris Chiozza, Justin Robinson, Shabazz Napier, now Aaron Holiday."
"Charlie Brown Jr, Jaylen Hoard, Gabriel Deck, Josh Hall, Justin Robinson  Heard any of those names before?  Our best player the past month is an undrafted Sophomore."
I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs it for Justin Robinson? Kind of stinks he lasted 2 10-day contracts but I bet he was more than ok making 100k in 20 days lol.
"And this is what Colangelo &amp; Brand did with all of them:  **Grant** - traded for a rental of Ilyasova and an OKC 2020 1st. The 1st was later traded for Anzejs Pasecniks who's rights were renounced before he ever played a game here, and Ilyasova was traded for a 2nd that was sold for cash considerations  **Holmes** - traded for cash considerations  **Noel** - traded for two 2nds and Justin Anderson. One 2nd was traded for cash. the other was packaged with two more 2nds for a rental of Alex Burks and Glenn Robinson III. Anderson was packaged with Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot (Colangelo 1st round pick) for Mike Muscala, who was packaged in the Tobias Harris trade  **McConnell** left as a FA  **Okafor** was packaged with a 2nd for a rental of Trevor Booker, BC paid an asset to get rid of him when the year prior Hinkie was very close to trading Okafor for Boston's unprotected Brooklyn pick which became Tatum, but Scott O'Neil/ownership blocked the trade. (Ainge confirmed it was close)  **Covington + Saric** were packaged with 2nds for a rental of Butler, who was traded for Josh Richardson, who was packaged with a 2nd for Seth Curry  **The Kings 1st** was traded away in the Fultz trade  **The Lakers 1st** was Mikal Bridges but they traded him for a Miami 2021 1st and Zhaire Smith. Smith was traded for cash and the 1st was packaged for Harris  --------  Just an incredible, astonishingly bad stretch of waste with no long term vision"
I agree. Lamelo has the name going for him which is why he will edge it out if it's close. It's like Justin Herbert winning ROTY in the NFL when Justin Jefferson or James Robinson probably deserved it more (still a close race).
"A team being significantly better 4-8 makes a world of difference come playoff time, especially considering that the given the chemistry issues and the fit issues that the Nets have with their top 3 (if kyrie doesnt retire, top 2 if he does), the Bucks/Heat/Celtics/76ers are all close enough top end wise that having much better depth would more than make up for the difference  You can hype up the Nets scrubs all you want, but Harris is no better than DiVincenzo, Seth Curry, Duncan Robinson, Justin Holiday, KCP, Bojan Bogdanovic, Mikal Bridges, Trent Jr, etc etc etc  And even if Harris was a hair better than any of those guys, which again he's not, each of those teams are sooo much better 5-8 that it isn't even comparable. Bruce Brown, Shamet, TLC, Chiozza are all players that only see playing time because of how bad the depth is on the Nets. Okay maybe Brown would get bench time on other teams, but even that is stretching  I'm not grasping at anything. I'm literally spitting facts of why the Nets are not title contenders as currently constructed, and I have evidence to back it up considering that they struggled to beat the worst team in the league yesterday  Keep spinning the facts, whatchu got next?"
"I was a Mavericks fan since 2000. If you were a fan of the team instead of being a Luka stan, you would see the poor moves management makes that break the team.  &amp;#x200B;  The Rondo trade for one. The Mavs were playing good ball and they broke their Offense for a guy that assist hunts. The team before had the ability to be unselfish on the offense and make hockey assists. They were a 4th seed.  The Odom Trade. This trade should never have been made simply for what he did to JJ Barea.  &amp;#x200B;  Right now the team is based around a Lebron James / James Harden type player who has an usage rate that outpaces his conditioning, surrounded by inconsistent shooters but they expect to live or die by the three. They are 28th in 3pt%.   * If you are going to trade someone, trade for someone who can shoot. Yet they traded a guy in Barnes that can shoot for Justin Jackson. * They drafted Shane Larkin over Giannis.  * They drafted Jalen Brunson, a player who assist hunts, shoots first, a poor defender, and is a black hole on offense over Mitchell Robinson. * They traded Shake Milton to the 76ers while keeping Isaiah Roby even though they had too many SFs at the time, and had Brunson backing Luka up. * They allowed McDermont to leave. * They traded Dennis Smith Jr to the Knicks so Luka can be the main focus on the offense. Yet he doesn't have the conditioning to play Lebron type minutes.  &amp;#x200B;  It's silly and sad. I don't wish to be a Mavs fan. I'm not a fan of that team anymore."

"Yep, he's good at torching Justin Robinson (had to actually check his name) in a RS game."
I don't know if Justin Robinson and Sandro Mamukelashvili are known for elite defense. I don't think they're known for anything.
Justin Robinson and Georgios weren't even drafted. Mamu was a second rounder. They literally are G league players...  I mean the rest of our players still played like shit and I wish it was more competitive but let's be real about what kind of rotation the bucks had
bucks  running a Justin Robinson / Thansis / Grayson Allen / Nwora / Mamu lineup lmao
"The top 5 teams. I'm laughing.  One of those teams were healthy last night and got blown out by a Bucks team missing 5 of their players and running Justin Robinson, Mamukeshvili and Thanasis for substantial minutes."
justin robinson lmao
"Fox and Haliburton haven‚Äôt struggled to grow here.  People always say this, but can you name a King‚Äôs draft pick that has gone on to play a lot better than they did with the Kings?  Jimmer, Stauskus, Thomas Robinson, Georgios Pappagiannis, Harry Giles, Justin Jackson, Mclemore?"
"Sandro Mamukaleshvili probably should have a full roster spot, while Giorgios Kalaitzakis probably should be the guy on a two way, but it is the opposite right now.  Bucks probably leaving final roster spot open and so Mamu is stuck on a two way.  Kalaitzakis may be able to defend decently, but doesn't bring much offense.  Sandro really can play, but may lack defense/athleticism.  Justin Robinson probably most deserving of the second two-way, not sure if he will get it.  But he looks better than Tremont Waters to me."
"1) Eligible but not in the league- Isaiah Thomas  2) Short contracts(two-ways, ten-day contracts)- Karim Man√©  3) Non-rotation bench players- Justin Robinson  4) Rotational bench player- Brad Wanamaker   5) Elite bench player(6 MOTY candidates)- Jordan Clarkson  6) Basic starter- Harrison Barnes   7) Niche Starter- Myles Turner   8) Elite starter- Jerami Grant   9) Border line All-Star- CJ McCollum   10) All-Star- Donovan Mitchell   11) All-NBA- Luka Doncic   11) MVP Level- Kevin Durant"
"It's mostly our early picks though. Kris Dunn, Jarrett Culver, Justin Patton, Shabazz Muhammad, Derrick Williams, Wesley Johnson, Johnny Flynn all inside the the top 20 and are all busts surrounded by better picks in the draft. Add to that Wiggins and Rubio not living up to the hype. Even going way back and trading Brandon Roy for Randy Foye.  Then you look and see Gorgui Dieng, Tyus Jones, Josh Okogie, Jaden McDaniels, Nikola Pekovic, Glenn Robinson, Nemanja Bjelica and none of them are world beaters but they all will have/had nice NBA careers. You need to hit with your early picks more often than we did. It seems things may be changing but I won't believe it until it's actually happened."
"Lemme throw in my experiences seeing NBA players up close:  Basically anyone around the 7 ft range (I've seen Drew Eubanks, David Robinson, Alex Len and Dexter Pittman up close), I still cannot comprehend how someone can be that tall, let alone *extremely athletic*  PJ Tucker, Eric Bledsoe and Justin Anderson look like powerlifters more than hoopers, those dudes are chiseled   Trae Young looks exactly how you expect.  Bryn Forbes is insanely short for a NBA player  Rudy Gay is the only person I've seen where their wingspan blew me away, I never saw him as long on TV but apparently he was a 7'3"" wingspan."
Question: Who the hell is Justin Robinson?
